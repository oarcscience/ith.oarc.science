There is no higher being than myself or Vish<I>n</I>u. The great Vish<I>n</I>u full of the Brahman is the king of kings over all. Understand him to be the ruler, the creator, the uncreated Hari.

<P>piety; and Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as are the bridges&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1726"></A><A HREF="#fn_1719"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of piety. Therefore a king should always endeavour to protect the twice-born&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1727"></A><A HREF="#fn_1720"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Those kings in whose dominions good men lie low, lose all their qualifications&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1728"></A><A HREF="#fn_1721"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and go into wrong paths after death. But those high-souled kings in whose dominions good men are protected, rejoice in this world, and attain the infinite (seat) after death. Understand this, O chiefs of the twice-born! I shall now proceed to state the invariable characteristics of piety. Non-destruction is the highest piety&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1729"></A><A HREF="#fn_1722"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and destruction is of the nature of impiety. Enlightenment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1730"></A><A HREF="#fn_1723"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> is the characteristic of gods; action&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1731"></A><A HREF="#fn_1724"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> the characteristic of men; sound is the characteristic of space; (the sensation of) touch is the characteristic of air; colour is the characteristic of light; taste is the characteristic of water; the characteristic of earth, the supporter of all beings, is smell; words are the characteristic of speech&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1732"></A><A HREF="#fn_1725"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> refined into vowels and consonants; the characteristic of mind is thought. Likewise as to what is described here as understanding, a determination</P>

<P>is here formed by (that) understanding about objects which have been thought over by the mind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1733"></A><A HREF="#fn_1726"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And there is no doubt of this that determination is the characteristic of the understanding. The characteristic of mind is meditation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1734"></A><A HREF="#fn_1727"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and the characteristic of a good man is (living) unperceived&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1735"></A><A HREF="#fn_1728"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. The characteristic of devotion is action&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1736"></A><A HREF="#fn_1729"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; and knowledge, the characteristic of renunciation. Therefore a man of understanding should practice renunciation, giving prominence to knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1737"></A><A HREF="#fn_1730"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. The renouncer possessed of knowledge attains the highest goal. And crossing beyond darkness, and transcending death and old age, he repairs to that which has no second&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1738"></A><A HREF="#fn_1731"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. Thus have I duly spoken to you concerning the characteristic of piety. I will now proceed to explain properly the comprehension&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1739"></A><A HREF="#fn_1732"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> of the qualities. As to the smell of the earth, verily, that is comprehended by the nose; and the wind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1740"></A><A HREF="#fn_1733"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> likewise residing in the nose is a pointed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1741"></A><A HREF="#fn_1734"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> to the knowledge of smell.

<P>the essence of water, is always comprehended by the tongue. And the moon likewise, who resides in the tongue, is appointed to the knowledge of taste. The quality of light is colour, and that is comprehended by the eye; and the sun residing in the eye is appointed always to the knowledge of colour. The (sensation of) touch, belonging to the air, is perceived by the skin, and the wind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1743"></A><A HREF="#fn_1736"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> residing in the skin is always appointed to the knowledge of (the objects) of touch. The quality of space is sound, and that is comprehended by the ear. And all the quarters residing in the ear are celebrated as (being appointed) to the knowledge of sound. Thought is the quality of mind, and that is comprehended by the understanding. The supporter of consciousness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1744"></A><A HREF="#fn_1737"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> residing in the heart is appointed to the knowledge of mind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1745"></A><A HREF="#fn_1738"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. The understanding (is comprehended in the form of) determination, and the Mahat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1746"></A><A HREF="#fn_1739"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of knowledge. To (this) positive comprehension, the unperceived&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1747"></A><A HREF="#fn_1740"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> (is appointed), there is no doubt of that. The Kshetra<I>g</I>&ntilde;a, which is in its essence devoid of qualities and eternal, is not to be comprehended by any</P>

<P>symbols. Therefore the characteristic of the Kshetra<I>g</I>&ntilde;a, which is void of symbols&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1748"></A><A HREF="#fn_1741"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, is purely knowledge. The unperceived is stated to be the Kshetra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1749"></A><A HREF="#fn_1742"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in which the qualities are produced and absorbed. And I always see, know, and hear it, (though) concealed. The Purusha knows it, therefore is he called Kshetra<I>g</I>&ntilde;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1750"></A><A HREF="#fn_1743"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. And the Kshetra<I>g</I>&ntilde;a likewise perceives all the operations of the qualities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1751"></A><A HREF="#fn_1744"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. The qualities created again and again, do not know themselves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1752"></A><A HREF="#fn_1745"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, being nonintelligent, to be created and tied down to a beginning, middle, and end&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1753"></A><A HREF="#fn_1746"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. Only the Kshetra<I>g</I>&ntilde;a attains, no one, (else) attains, to the truth, which is great, transcendent, and beyond the qualities and the entities (produced)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1754"></A><A HREF="#fn_1747"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> from the qualities. Hence a man who understands piety, abandoning qualities, and the creation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1755"></A><A HREF="#fn_1748"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, in this world, and transcending the qualities, and having his sins destroyed, then enters into the Kshetra<I>g</I>&ntilde;a.

<P><A NAME="fn_1707"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1714">346:1</A> As to the constructions here, cf. generally G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0812.htm#page_88">p. 88</A>, and see the remarks of R&acirc;m&acirc;nu<I>g</I>a and <I>S</I>r&icirc;dhara on G&icirc;t&acirc; X, 21. The meaning here is, of course, the male is ruler over females.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1708"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1715">346:2</A> I do not know what distinction is intended between these two. Generally k&icirc;<I>k</I>aka is used for the hollow bamboo, which whistles when the wind blows through it.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1710"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1717">346:4</A> This list may be compared with that at G&icirc;t&acirc;, chapter X. Sometimes the same object occurs more than once with reference to more than one class; thus the moon occurs as lord of Nakshatras, of shining bodies, and of herbs--unless Soma there stands for the Soma plant. See G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0817.htm#page_113">p. 113</A>. Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra says expressly that the moon occurs more than once as the correlatives, the classes with reference to which she is mentioned, are different. In such cases I have kept the original names untranslated; Arka = sun; Indu = moon.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1732"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1739">349:7</A> Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra's interpretation seems to be different, but our copy is not quite intelligible.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1733"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1740">349:8</A> See <A HREF="sbe0854.htm#page_337">p. 337</A> supra. The wind is the presiding deity of the nasal organ.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1734"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1741">349:9</A> I. e. that is its function. Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra says, 'it is pondered on,' which is not clear.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1735"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1742">349:10</A> Cf. G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0809.htm#page_74">p. 74</A>, as to taste and water.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1736"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1743">350:1</A> This cannot be the presiding deity here, though one expects such deity to be mentioned; see <A HREF="sbe0854.htm#page_337">p. 337</A> supra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1737"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1744">350:2</A> The text of more than one of the lines here is rather doubtful; we follow N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, who takes this to mean the <I>g</I>&icirc;va, the individual soul. Cf. <A HREF="sbe0829.htm#page_239">p. 239</A>, note &nbsp;<A HREF="sbe0829.htm#fn_1095"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> supra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1738"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1745">350:3</A> I. e. thought, as N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a points out.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1739"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1746">350:4</A> Mahat is properly the same as buddhi, understanding, but as it is here mentioned separately, I suppose, it signifies Aha<U>n</U>k&acirc;ra. N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a takes its operation, here called knowledge, to mean 'the feeling I am,' which agrees with our interpretation, for which some support is also to be derived from <A HREF="sbe0852.htm#page_333">p. 333</A> supra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1740"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1747">350:5</A> I here follow Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra, though somewhat diffidently. The knowledge 'this is I,' and the knowledge 'this is so and so and nothing else' is presided over by the unperceived--the Prakriti.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1746"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1753">351:6</A> I. e. production, existence, and destruction, N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a. This must, however, mean their manifestation, continuance, and dissolution in any particular form. For the prak<I>ri</I>ti, which is made up of the three qualities, is beginningless. Cf.

<P><A NAME="fn_1747"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1754">351:7</A> I. e. the actual physical manifestations, as we may say, of the qualities.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1748"></A><A HREF="sbe0855.htm#fr_1755">351:8</A> The original, sattva, N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a renders by buddhi, and qualities by visible objects. In the familiar S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya phrase sattvapurush&acirc;nyat&acirc;pratyaya sattva means creation, or what is other than purusha (cf. S&acirc;<U>n</U>khyatattvakaumud&icirc;, pp. 9-144). That is the meaning here. See too <A HREF="sbe0859.htm#page_371">p. 371</A> infra, and <I>S</I>&acirc;nti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 194, st. 38 seq. and comments there.</P>
