# CHAPTER XVII.

The Brâhma*n*a said:

On this <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1](#fn_1449.md), too, they relate this
ancient story (in the shape of) a dialogue, O you of a pure heart!
between a Brâhma*n*a and *G*anaka. King *G*anaka, by way of punishment,
said to a Brâhma*n*a who had fallen into some offence: 'You should not
live within my dominions.' Thus spoken to, the Brâhma*n*a then replied
to that best of kings: 'Tell me, O king! how far (extend) the dominions
which are subject to you. I wish, O Lord! to live in the dominions of
another king, and, O master of the earth! I wish to do your bidding
according to the *S*âstras.' Thus spoken to by that glorious Brâhma*n*a,
the king then heaved frequent and warm sighs, and said nothing in reply.
While that king of unbounded power was seated, engaged in meditation, a
delusion suddenly came upon him, as the planet <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[2](#fn_1450.md) upon the sun. Then when the delusion
had gone off, the king recovered himself, and after a short while spoke
these words to the Brâhma*n*a.

Ganaka said:

Though this country, which is the kingdom of my father and grandfather,
is subject (to me), I cannot

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

find my domain <span id="fr_1456"></span>[1](#fn_1451.md), searching
through the (whole) earth. When I did not find it on the earth, I looked
for Mithilâ; when I did not find it in Mithilâ, I looked for my own
offspring. When I did not find it among them, then came the delusion on
me. Then on the expiration of the delusion, intelligence again came to
me. Now I think that there is no domain (of mine), or that everything is
my domain. Even this self is not mine, or the whole earth is mine. And
as mine, so (is it) that of others too, I believe, O best of the
twice-born! Live (here, therefore) while you desire, and enjoy while you
live <span id="fr_1457"></span>[2](#fn_1452.md).

The Brâhma*n*a said:

Tell me, what belief you have resorted to, by which, though this
country, which is the kingdom of your father and grandfather, is subject
to you, you have got rid of (the notion that this or that is) mine. What
conviction have you adopted, by which verily you consider your whole
domain as not (your) domain, or all as your domain?

Ganaka said:

I understand (all) conditions here, in all affairs, to be
terminable <span id="fr_1458"></span>[3](#fn_1453.md), hence I could not
find anything that should be (called) mine <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[4](#fn_1454). (Considering.md) whose this

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

was, (I thought of) the Vedic text about anybody's property, (hence) I
could not find by my intelligence anything that should be (called)
mine <span id="fr_1460"></span>[1](#fn_1455.md). Resorting to this
conviction, I have got rid of (the notion that this or that is) mine.
Now hear the conviction, holding which, my domain (appears to me to be)
everywhere <span id="fr_1461"></span>[2](#fn_1456.md). I do not desire for
myself even smells existing in the nose <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[3](#fn_1457.md). Therefore the earth <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[4](#fn_1458.md) being conquered is a ways subject to
me. I do not desire for myself tastes even dwelling in the mouth.
Therefore water being conquered is always subject to me. I do not desire
for myself the colour (or) light appertaining to the eye. Therefore
light being conquered is always subject to me. I do not desire for
myself the (feelings of touch.) which exist in the skin. Therefore air
being conquered is always

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

subject to me. I do not desire for myself sounds even though existing in
the ear. Therefore sounds being conquered are always subject to me. I do
not desire for myself the mind always within me. Therefore the mind
being conquered is always subject to me. All these actions of mine are,
verily, for this purpose, (namely) for the gods, the Pit*ri*s, the
Bhûtas, together with guests. Then the Brâhma*n*a, smiling, again said
to *G*anaka: 'Know me to be Dharma, come here to-day to learn
(something) about you <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1](sbe0845.htm#fn_1459.md). You are the one person to
turn this wheel, the nave of which is the Brahman <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[2](sbe0845.htm#fn_1460.md), the spoke the
understanding, and which does not turn back <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[3](sbe0845.htm#fn_1461.md), and which is checked by
the quality of goodness as its circumference <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[4](sbe0845.htm#fn_1462.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1449"></span>[303:1](sbe0844.htm#fr_1454.md) On getting rid of
the notion that this, that, and the other thing is one's own,--Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra. Nîlaka*nth*a agrees, and adds also on the subject of cutting
off avarice.

<span id="fn_1450"></span>[303:2](sbe0844.htm#fr_1455.md) That is to say,
Râhu.

<span id="fn_1451"></span>[304:1](sbe0844.htm#fr_1456.md) Meaning,
apparently, that over which he and no one else has power. He contracts
his vision gradually, and finds nothing at all which he can call his own
to the exclusion of others. He explains, further on, bow he arrives at
the alternative conviction stated towards the close of this speech. In
the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka (p. 916) he is said to have offered his kingdom
to Yâ*g*ñavalkya and himself as his slave, after learning the
Brahma-vidyâ. See too Muir, Sanskrit Texts, vol. iv, p. 426 seq.

<span id="fn_1452"></span>[304:2](sbe0844.htm#fr_1457.md) See *S*ânti
Parvan (Moksha) I, 13.

<span id="fn_1453"></span>[304:3](sbe0844.htm#fr_1458.md) Conditions of
indigence or affluence, Nîlaka*nth*a. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's reading is
different.

<span id="fn_1454"></span>[304:4](sbe0844.htm#fr_1459.md) There is a
familiar verse, ascribed to *G*anaka, which says, 'If <span
id="page_205">p. 205</span> Mithilâ is on fire, nothing of mine is;
burnt (in it).' The verse occurs in the Mahâbhârata, *S*ânti Parvan
(Moksha Dharma), chap. 178, st. 2, and also chap. 276, St. 4. See too
Muir, Sanskrit Texts, Vol. i, p. 429.

<span id="fn_1455"></span>[305:1](sbe0844.htm#fr_1460.md) This is not
clear. I have followed. Nîlaka*nth*a's text. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's is in
the earlier part more intelligible, 'Whose is this to-day, whose
to-morrow?' But I cannot find that there is any Vedic text to this
effect. Nîlaka*nth*a cites on his text Î*s*opanishad, p. 5. The meaning
here seems to be, 'When I considered as to whom the things I saw in my
thoughts belonged to, I remembered the Vedic text that one should not
wish too obtain another's property, and so, thinking about the matter
with that caution, I could not make out that there was anything which I
could call my own.'

<span id="fn_1456"></span>[305:2](sbe0844.htm#fr_1461.md) This is the
alternative conclusion he has come to.

<span id="fn_1457"></span>[305:3](sbe0844.htm#fr_1462.md) The sense of
smell enjoys the smell, my self has nothing to do with it. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
55](sbe0805.htm#page_55.md), also Maitrî, pp. 112, 113.

<span id="fn_1458"></span>[305:4](sbe0844.htm#fr_1463.md) Whenever there is
any smell, it is supposed that particles of earth are there; so the
meaning here is 'all things having the quality of smell are subject to
me,' and so throughout. The objects of sense are all used for the
purposes of the prescribed actions, the benefits of which accrue to
gods, &c. Cf. Gîtâ, pp. [53](sbe0805.htm#page_53.md),
[54](sbe0805.htm#page_54), and see also pp. [84](sbe0811.htm#page_84.md),
[85](sbe0811.htm#page_85.md).
