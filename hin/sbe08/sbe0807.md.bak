# CHAPTER V.

Ar*g*una said:

O K*ri*sh*n*a! you praise renunciation of actions and also the pursuit
(of them). Tell me determinately which one of these two is superior.

The Deity said:

Renunciation and pursuit of action are both instruments of happiness.
But of the two, pursuit of action is superior to renunciation of action.
He should be understood to be always an ascetic <span
id="fr_215"></span>[3](#fn_214.md), who has no aversion and no desire. For,
O you of mighty arms! he who is free from the pairs of opposites is
easily released from (all) bonds. Children--not wise men--talk of
sa<u>n</u>khya and yoga as

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

distinct. One who pursues either well obtains the fruit of both. The
seat which the sâ<u>n</u>khyas obtain is reached by the yogas <span
id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_215) also. He sees (truly.md), who sees the
sâ<u>n</u>khya and yoga as one. Renunciation, O you of mighty arms! is
difficult to reach without devotion; the sage possessed of devotion
attains Brahman <span id="fr_217"></span>[2](#fn_216.md) without delay. He
who is possessed of devotion, whose self is pure, who has restrained his
self <span id="fr_218"></span>[3](#fn_217.md), and who has controlled his
senses, and who identifies his self with every being, is not tainted
though he performs (actions). The man of devotion, who knows the truth,
thinks he does nothing at all, when he sees <span
id="fr_219"></span>[4](#fn_218.md), hears, touches, smells, eats, move-b,
sleeps, breathes, talks, throws out <span
id="fr_220"></span>[5](#fn_219.md), takes, opens or closes the eyelids; he
holds that the senses deal with the objects of the senses. He who,
casting off (all) attachment, performs actions dedicating them to
Brahman, is not tainted by sin, as the lotus-leaf <span
id="fr_221"></span>[6](#fn_220) (is not tainted.md) by water. Devotees,
casting off attachment, perform actions for attaining purity of self,
with the body, the mind, the understanding, or even the senses <span
id="fr_222"></span>[7](#fn_221)--(all.md) free (from

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

egoistic notions). He who is possessed of devotion, abandoning the fruit
of actions, attains the highest tranquillity. He who is without
devotion, and attached to the fruit (of action), is tied down by (reason
of his) acting in consequence of (some) desire. The self-restrained,
embodied (self) lies at case within the city of nine portals <span
id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_222.md), renouncing all actions by the mind, not
doing nor causing (any thing) to be done. The Lord is not the cause of
actions, or of the capacity of performing actions amongst men, or of the
connexion of action and fruit. But nature only works. The Lord receives
no one's sin, nor merit either. Knowledge is enveloped by ignorance,
hence all creatures are deluded <span id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_223.md).
But to those who have destroyed that ignorance by knowledge of the self,
(such) knowledge, like the sun, shows forth that supreme (principle).
And those whose mind is (centred) on it, whose (very) self it is, who
are thoroughly devoted to it, and whose final goal it is, go never to
return, having their sins destroyed by knowledge. The wise look upon a
Brâhma*n*a possessed of learning and humility, on a cow, an elephant, a
dog, and a *S*vapâka, as alike <span id="fr_225"></span>[3](#fn_224.md).
Even here, those have conquered the material world, whose mind rests in
equability <span id="fr_226"></span>[4](#fn_225.md); since Brahman is free
from defects and equable, therefore they rest in

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Brahman. He who knows Brahman, whose mind is
steady, who is not deluded, and who rests in Brahman, does not exult on
finding anything agreeable, nor does he grieve on finding anything
disagreeable <span id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_226.md). One whose self is
not attached to external objects, obtains the happiness that is in
(one's) self; and by means of concentration of mind, joining one's self
(with the Brahman), one obtains indestructible happiness. For the
enjoyments born of contact (between senses and their objects) are,
indeed, sources of misery; they have a beginning as well as an end <span
id="fr_228"></span>[2](#fn_227.md). O son of Kuntî! a wise man feels no
pleasure in them. He who even in this world, before his release from the
body, is able to bear the agitations produced from desire and wrath, is
a devoted man, he is a happy man. The devotee whose happiness is within
(himself), whose recreation is within (himself), and whose light (of
knowledge) also is within (himself), becoming (one with) the
Brahman <span id="fr_229"></span>[3](#fn_228.md), obtain the Brahmic
bliss <span id="fr_230"></span>[4](#fn_229.md). The sages whose sins have
perished, whose misgivings are destroyed, who are self-restrained, and
who are intent on the welfare of all beings <span
id="fr_231"></span>[5](#fn_230.md), obtain the Brahmic bliss. To the
ascetics, who are free from desire and wrath <span
id="fr_232"></span>[6](#fn_231.md), and whose minds are restrained, and who
have knowledge of the self, the Brahmic bliss is on both sides (of
death). The sage who excludes (from his mind)

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

external objects, (concentrates) the visual power between the
brows <span id="fr_233"></span>[1](sbe0808.htm#fn_232.md), and making the
upward and downward life-breaths even, confines their movements within
the nose, who restrains senses, mind, and understanding <span
id="fr_234"></span>[2](sbe0808.htm#fn_233.md), whose highest goal is final
emancipation, from whom desire, fear, and wrath have departed, is,
indeed, for ever released (from birth and death). He knowing me to be
the enjoyer of all sacrifices and penances, the great Lord of all
worlds, and the friend of all beings, attains tranquillity.
