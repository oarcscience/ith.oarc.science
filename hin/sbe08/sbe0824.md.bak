# CHAPTER III.

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said:

Who possesses this taciturnity <span id="fr_714"></span>[5](#fn_709.md),
and which of the two <span id="fr_715"></span>[6](#fn_710.md) is
taciturnity? Describe, O learned person! the condition of taciturnity
here. Does a learned man reach taciturnity <span
id="fr_716"></span>[7](#fn_711.md) by taciturnity? And how, O sage! do they
practise taciturnity in this world

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

Sanatsu*g*âta said:

Since the Vedas, together with the mind <span
id="fr_717"></span>[1](#fn_712), fail to attain to him, hence (is he.md)
taciturnity <span id="fr_718"></span>[2](#fn_713.md)--he about whom the
words of the Vedas were uttered <span id="fr_719"></span>[3](#fn_714.md),
and who, O king! shines forth as consubstantial <span
id="fr_720"></span>[4](#fn_715.md) with them.

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said:

Does <span id="fr_721"></span>[5](#fn_716.md) the twice-born person who
studies the *Rik* and the Ya*g*us texts, and the Sâma-veda, committing
sinful (acts), become tainted, or does he not become tainted?

Sanatsu*g*âta said

Not the Sâman texts, nor yet the *Rik* Texts, nor the Ya*g*us
texts <span id="fr_722"></span>[6](#fn_717.md) save him, O acute sir! from
sinful

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

action. I do not tell you an untruth. The *Kh*andas do not save a sinful
deceitful <span id="fr_723"></span>[1](#fn_718.md) man who behaves
deceitfully <span id="fr_724"></span>[2](#fn_719.md). At the time of the
termination (of his life), the *Kh*andas abandon <span
id="fr_725"></span>[3](#fn_720.md) him, as birds who have got wings
(abandon their) nest.

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said

If, O acute sir! the Vedas are not able to save one who understands the
Vedas, then whence is this eternal talk <span
id="fr_726"></span>[4](#fn_721.md) of the Brâhma*n*as?

Sanatsu*g*âta said:

O you of great glory! this universe becomes manifest through his special
forms--names <span id="fr_727"></span>[5](#fn_722.md) and the rest. The
Vedas proclaim (his form) after describing (it) well <span
id="fr_728"></span>[6](#fn_723.md), and (they <span
id="fr_729"></span>[7](#fn_724) also.md) state his difference from the
universe. For that <span id="fr_730"></span>[8](#fn_725.md) are this
penance and sacrifice prescribed. By these a learned man acquires merit,
and afterwards destroying sin by merit <span
id="fr_731"></span>[9](#fn_726.md), he has his self illuminated by
knowledge. By knowledge the learned man attains

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

the self <span id="fr_732"></span>[1](#fn_727.md). But, on the other hand,
one who wishes for the fruit--heaven <span
id="fr_733"></span>[2](#fn_728.md)--takes with him <span
id="fr_734"></span>[3](#fn_729) all that he has done in this (world.md),
enjoys it in the next, and then returns to the path <span
id="fr_735"></span>[4](#fn_730) (of this world.md). Penance is performed in
this world; the fruit is enjoyed elsewhere. But the penance of
Brâhma*n*as is further developed <span id="fr_736"></span>[5](#fn_731.md);
that of others remains only as much (as when first performed).

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said:

How does the pure penance become developed and well developed <span
id="fr_737"></span>[6](#fn_732)? O Sanatsu*g*âta! tell (me..md) how I
should understand that, O Lord!

Sanatsu*g*âta said:

This penance, free from sin <span id="fr_738"></span>[7](#fn_733.md), is
called pure <span id="fr_739"></span>[8](#fn_734.md); and this pure penance
becomes developed and well developed, not otherwise <span
id="fr_740"></span>[9](#fn_735.md). All this <span
id="fr_741"></span>[10](#fn_736.md), O Kshatriya!

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

has for its root that penance about which you question me. By
penance <span id="fr_742"></span>[1](#fn_737.md), those conversant with the
Vedas attained immortality, after departing from this world.

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said.

1 have heard about penance free from sin, O Sanatsu*g*âta! Tell me what
is the sin (connected) with penance, so that I may understand the
eternal mystery <span id="fr_743"></span>[2](#fn_738.md).

Sanatsu*g*âta said:

The twelve beginning with wrath, and likewise the seven cruelties, are
the defects (connected) with it; and there are (stated) in the Sâstras
twelve merits (connected) with it, beginning with knowledge, which are
known to the twice-born, and may be developed. Wrath, desire <span
id="fr_744"></span>[3](#fn_739.md), avarice, delusion <span
id="fr_745"></span>[4](#fn_740.md), craving <span
id="fr_746"></span>[5](#fn_741.md), mercilessness, censoriousness, vanity,
grief <span id="fr_747"></span>[6](#fn_742.md), attachment <span
id="fr_748"></span>[7](#fn_743.md), envy <span
id="fr_749"></span>[8](#fn_744.md), reviling others--these twelve should
always be avoided by a man of high

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

qualifications <span id="fr_750"></span>[1](#fn_745.md). These, O king of
kings! attend each and every man, wishing to find some opening <span
id="fr_751"></span>[2](#fn_746), as a hunter (watches.md) animals.
\[Boastful, lustful, haughty, irascible, unsteady <span
id="fr_752"></span>[3](#fn_747.md), one who does not protect (those
dependent <span id="fr_753"></span>[4](#fn_748) on him.md), these six
sinful acts are performed by sinful men who are not afraid (even) in the
midst of great danger <span id="fr_754"></span>[5](#fn_749.md).\] One whose
thoughts are (all) about enjoyments, who prospers by injuring (others),
who repents of generosity, who is miserly, who is devoid of the
power <span id="fr_755"></span>[6](#fn_750) (of knowledge.md), who esteems
the group <span id="fr_756"></span>[7](#fn_751) (of the senses.md), who
hates his wife <span id="fr_757"></span>[8](#fn_752.md)--these seven,
different (from those previously mentioned), are the seven forms of
cruelty. Knowledge, truth, self-restraint, sacred learning, freedom from
animosity (towards living beings), modesty <span
id="fr_758"></span>[9](#fn_753.md), endurance <span
id="fr_759"></span>[10](#fn_754.md), freedom from censoriousness,
sacrifice, gift, courage} <span id="fr_760"></span>[11](#fn_755.md),
quiescence <span id="fr_761"></span>[12](#fn_756.md),these are the twelve
great observances <span id="fr_762"></span>[13](#fn_757.md) of a
Brâhma*n*a. Whoever is not devoid of these twelve can govern this whole
world, and those who are

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

possessed of three, two, or even one (of these) become, in (due) course,
distinguished (for knowledge) and identified with the Brahman <span
id="fr_763"></span>[1](#fn_758.md). \[Self-restraint, abandonment <span
id="fr_764"></span>[2](#fn_759.md), and freedom from heedlessness--on these
depends immortality. And the talented Brâhma*n*as say that truth is
chief over them.\] Self-restraint has eighteen defects; if (any one of
them is) committed, it is an obstacle (to self-restraint), They are thus
stated. 'Untruthfulness, backbiting, thirst <span
id="fr_765"></span>[3](#fn_760), antipathy (to all beings.md),
darkness <span id="fr_766"></span>[4](#fn_761.md), repining <span
id="fr_767"></span>[5](#fn_762.md), hatred <span
id="fr_768"></span>[6](#fn_763.md) of people, haughtiness, quarrelsomeness,
injuring living creatures, reviling others, garrulity, vexation <span
id="fr_769"></span>[7](#fn_764.md), want of endurance <span
id="fr_770"></span>[8](#fn_765.md), want of courage <span
id="fr_771"></span>[9](#fn_766.md), imperfection <span
id="fr_772"></span>[10](#fn_767.md), sinful conduct, and slaughter. That is
called self-restraint by the good, which is free from these defects.
Frenzy has eighteen defects <span id="fr_773"></span>[11](#fn_768.md); and
abandonment is of six kinds. The contraries of those which have been
laid down <span id="fr_774"></span>[12](#fn_769.md) are stated to be the
defects of frenzy. Abandonment of six kinds is excellent. Of those six,
the third is hard to achieve. With it one certainly crosses

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

beyond all misery without distinction <span
id="fr_775"></span>[1](#fn_770). That being achieved, (everything.md) is
accomplished <span id="fr_776"></span>[2](#fn_771). The (first is the.md)
giving away of sons and wealth to a deserving man who asks (for them);
the second is gifts at Vedic ceremonies, and gifts at ceremonies laid
down in the Sm*ri*tis <span id="fr_777"></span>[3](#fn_772.md). The
abandonment of desires, O king of kings! by means of indifference (to
worldly objects) is laid down as the third <span
id="fr_778"></span>[4](#fn_773.md). With these one should become free from
heedlessness. That freedom from heedlessness, too, has eight
characteristics, and is (a) great (merit). Truthfulness, concentration,
absorbed contemplation, reflexion <span id="fr_779"></span>[5](#fn_774.md),
and also indifference (to worldly objects), not stealing <span
id="fr_780"></span>[6](#fn_775.md), living the life of a Brahma*k*ârin, and

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

likewise freedom from all belongings <span
id="fr_781"></span>[1](#fn_776.md). Thus have the defects of self-restraint
been stated; one should avoid those defects. Freedom from (those)
defects is freedom from heedlessness; and that, too, is deemed to have
eight characteristics <span id="fr_782"></span>[2](#fn_777.md). Let truth
be your (very) self, O king of kings! On truth all the worlds rest <span
id="fr_783"></span>[3](#fn_778.md). Truth is said to be their main
(principle). Immortality, depends on truth <span
id="fr_784"></span>[4](#fn_779). Getting rid of (these.md) defects, one
should practise the observance of penance. This is the conduct
prescribed by the Creator. Truth is the solemn vow of the good. The pure
penance, which is free from these defects, and possessed of these
characteristics, becomes developed, and well developed <span
id="fr_785"></span>[5](#fn_780.md). I will state to you, in brief, O king
of kings! what you ask of me. This (observance) <span
id="fr_786"></span>[6](#fn_781.md) is destructive of sin, and pure, and
releases (one) from birth and death and old age <span
id="fr_787"></span>[7](#fn_782.md). If one is free from the five senses,
and also from the mind <span id="fr_788"></span>[8](#fn_783.md), O
descendant of Bharata! also from (thoughts regarding) the past and the
future <span id="fr_789"></span>[9](#fn_784.md), one becomes happy.

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said:

Some people make great boasts in consequence of (their knowing) the
Vedas with the Âkhyânas as

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

the fifth <span id="fr_790"></span>[1](#fn_785.md); others, likewise, are
(masters) of four Vedas; others, too, of three Vedas; others are
(masters) of two Vedas, and of one Veda; and others of no Veda <span
id="fr_791"></span>[2](#fn_786.md). Tell me which of these is the greatest,
whom I may know (to be) a Brâhma*n*a.

Sanatsu*g*âta said:

Through ignorance of the one Veda <span
id="fr_792"></span>[3](#fn_787.md)--the one truth--O king of kings!
numerous Vedas came into existence. Some <span
id="fr_793"></span>[4](#fn_788.md) only adhere to the truth. The fancies of
those who have fallen away from the truth are abortive, and through
ignorance of the truth, ceremonies become amplified <span
id="fr_794"></span>[5](#fn_789.md). One should under stand a Brâhma*n*a,
who (merely) reads much, to be a man of many words <span
id="fr_795"></span>[6](#fn_790). Know him only to be the (true.md)
Brâhma*n*a, who swerves not from the truth <span
id="fr_796"></span>[7](#fn_791.md). O you who are the highest among
men <span id="fr_797"></span>[8](#fn_792.md)! the *Kh*andas, indeed, refer
of themselves <span id="fr_798"></span>[9](#fn_793.md) to it. Therefore,

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

studying them, the learned persons who understand the *Kh*andas, attain
to the Veda, not that which is to be known <span
id="fr_799"></span>[1](#fn_794.md). Among the Vedas, there is none which
understands <span id="fr_800"></span>[2](#fn_795.md). By the
unintelligent <span id="fr_801"></span>[3](#fn_796.md), one understands not
the Veda, nor the object of knowledge <span
id="fr_802"></span>[4](#fn_797.md). He who knows the Veda knows the object
of knowledge. He who knows the object of knowledge <span
id="fr_803"></span>[5](#fn_798.md) knows not the truth. He who understands
the Vedas understands also the object of knowledge; but that <span
id="fr_804"></span>[6](#fn_799.md) is not understood by the Vedas or by
those who understand the Vedas. Still the Brâhma*n*as who understand the
Vedas, understand the Veda by means of the Vedas <span
id="fr_805"></span>[7](#fn_800.md). As the branch of a tree with regard to
the part of a portion of the glorious <span
id="fr_806"></span>[8](#fn_801.md) one, so, they declare, are the Vedas
with

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

regard to the subject of understanding the supreme self. I understand
him to be a Brâhma*n*a who is ingenious, and explains <span
id="fr_807"></span>[1](#fn_802) (Vedic texts.md). He who apprehends (those
texts) thus <span id="fr_808"></span>[2](#fn_803.md), does verily know that
supreme (principle). . One should not go in search of it among (things)
antagonistic <span id="fr_809"></span>[3](#fn_804.md) to it at all. Not
looking (for him there) one sees that Lord by means of the Veda <span
id="fr_810"></span>[4](#fn_805.md). Remaining quiet, one should practise
devotion, and should not even form a wish in the mind <span
id="fr_811"></span>[5](#fn_806.md). To him, the Brahman presents <span
id="fr_812"></span>[6](#fn_807.md) itself, and directly afterwards he
attains to the perfect <span id="fr_813"></span>[7](#fn_808) (one.md). By
taciturnity <span id="fr_814"></span>[8](#fn_809.md), verily, does one
become a sage; (one does) not (become) a sage by dwelling in a
forest <span id="fr_815"></span>[9](#fn_810.md). And he is called the
highest sage, who understands that indestructible (principle). One is
called an analyser <span id="fr_816"></span>[10](#fn_811) (also.md) in
consequence of

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

analysing all objects. The analysis (is) from that as the root; and as
he makes (such an) analysis, hence is he so (called). The man who sees
the worlds directly sees everything <span
id="fr_817"></span>[1](sbe0825.htm#fn_812.md). A Brâhma*n*a, verily,
adhering to the truth, understands it, and becomes omniscient. I say to
you, O learned person! that adhering to knowledge and the rest <span
id="fr_818"></span>[2](sbe0825.htm#fn_813.md) in this way, one sees the
Brahman, O Kshatriya! by means of a course (of study) in the Vedas <span
id="fr_819"></span>[3](sbe0825.htm#fn_814.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_705"></span>[162:1](sbe0823.htm#fr_710.md) I. e. they both
follow on devotion to worldly life.

<span id="fn_706"></span>[162:2](sbe0823.htm#fr_711.md) I. e. in the way to
final emancipation.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[162:3](sbe0823.htm#fr_712.md) The enjoyment of
supreme felicity, Brahmânanda (*S*a<u>n</u>kara); the greatness
consisting of a knowledge of *Rik*, Ya*g*us, *S*âman, and the substance
of their teaching, which is worthy of a Brâhma*n*a (Nîlakan*th*a). See,
too, Anugîtâ, [p. 232](sbe0828.htm#page_232.md).

<span id="fn_708"></span>[162:4](sbe0823.htm#fr_713.md) Modesty = being
ashamed of doing wrong; restraint (of senses) =mental restraint; and
purity is both internal and external,--*S*a<u>n</u>kara; knowledge is,
of course, knowledge of the Brahman.

<span id="fn_709"></span>[162:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_714.md) I. e. that spoken
of in the last chapter.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[162:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_715.md) Viz. mere silence,
or the contemplation of the self after restraining all the senses. In
the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka-upanishad, *S*a<u>n</u>kara (p. 605) renders the
original word, mauna, to mean, 'The fruit of the destruction of the
consciousness of anything other than the self.' And his commentator
makes it clearer thus: 'The conviction in the mind that one is the
self--the supreme Brahman--and that there is nothing close existing but
oneself.'

<span id="fn_711"></span>[162:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_716.md) I. e. the highest
seat--the Brahman; for mind, sense, &c. are all non-existent there. Cf.
Ka*th*a, p. 151, and Maitrî, p. 161

<span id="fn_712"></span>[163:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_717.md) Cf. Kenopanishad,
p. 39; Ka*th*a, p. 152; Taittirîya, p. 119.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[163:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_718.md) 'Taciturnity is his
name,' says Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[163:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_719.md) Or, says
*S*a<u>n</u>kara, 'who is the author of the Vedas.'

<span id="fn_715"></span>[163:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_720.md) I. e. 'with the
Vedas,' says Nîlaka*nth*a, Om, the quintessence of the Vedas, being a
name of the Brahman (as to which cf. Gîtâ, [p. 79](sbe0810.htm#page_79.md),
and Maitrî, p. 84). *S*a<u>n</u>kara takes the whole expression to mean
*g*yotirmaya, consisting of light. Nîlaka*nth*a says this stanza answers
the five following questions put in the stanza preceding, viz. of what
use is taciturnity? which of the two is taciturnity? &c., as above. The
first four questions are answered by the first two lines of this
stanza--the substance of the answer being, that the use of taciturnity
is to attain the seat which is not to be grasped even by the mind, that
taciturnity includes both restraint of mind and of the external senses.
By means of such restraint, the external and internal worlds cease to be
perceived as existing, and the highest goal is attained.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[163:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_721.md) This question
arises naturally enough on Nîlaka*nth*a's interpretation of the
preceding stanza, the meaning of which is in substance that the Vedas
cannot grasp the Brahman fully, but they are of use towards a
rudimentary comprehension of it, as is said further on, see [p.
172](#page_172.md) infra.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[163:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_722.md) Cf.
*S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad, p. 339; see, too, N*ri*si*m*ha Tâpinî, pp.
81-98.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[164:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_723.md) I. e. one who
parades his piety.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[164:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_724.md) I. e.
hypocritically.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[164:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_725.md) I. e. do not rise
to his memory--Nîlaka*nth*a, citing Gîtâ, [p. 78](sbe0810.htm#page_78.md)
supra.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[164:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_726.md) Scil. about the
veneration due to one who has studied the Vedas--Nîlaka*nth*a, citing
one or two passages in point.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[164:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_727.md) The universe
consists of 'names and forms,' the reality being the Brahman only. Cf.
*Kh*ândogya, p. 407 seq.

<span id="fn_723"></span>[164:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_728.md) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
refers to Taittirîya-upanishad, p. 68; *Kh*ândogya, p. 596 seq. &c.

<span id="fn_724"></span>[164:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_729.md) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
takes this to mean 'sages,' who, according to him, state the difference.
He quotes Parâ*s*ara for this.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[164:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_730.md) I.e. the Brahman,
that is to say, for attaining to it. Penance = *k*ândrâya*n*a and other
observances; sacrifice = *g*yotish*t*oma, &c.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[164:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_731.md) Cf. [p.
158](sbe0823.htm#page_158.md) supra, and Taittirîya-âra*ny*aka, p. 888.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[165:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_732.md) Cf.
*S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 327; Mu*nd*aka, p. 323.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[165:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_733.md) So
*S*a<u>n</u>kara. Nîlaka*nth*a takes the original word to mean 'the
group of the senses,' and the whole phrase to mean 'enjoyments of
sense.' Nîlaka*nth*a is supported by a passage further on, [p.
167](#page_167.md). But as to 'those who wish for heaven,' cf. Gîtâ, pp.
[48](sbe0804.htm#page_48)-[84](sbe0811.htm#page_84.md).

<span id="fn_729"></span>[165:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_734.md) I. e. in the form
of merit, &c.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[165:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_735.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
84](sbe0811.htm#page_84.md).

<span id="fn_731"></span>[165:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_736.md) Cf. *Kh*ândogya, p.
23. Brâhma*n*as = those that know the Brahman. See [p. 171](#page_171.md)
infra.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[165:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_737.md) I am not quite sure
about the meaning of the original here. *Ri*dha, which I have rendered
'developed,' Nîlaka*nth*a understands to mean 'what is performed merely
for show.' What has been rendered 'well developed' in the text,
Nîlaka*nth*a takes to mean performed from some desire,' &c.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[165:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_738.md) Anger, desire, &c.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[165:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_739.md) The original is
kevala. Nîlaka*nth*a says it is so called as being a means of kaivalya,
'final emancipation.'

<span id="fn_735"></span>[165:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_740.md) I. e. not that
which is not free from sin, which latter is not developed at all.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[165:10](sbe0824.htm#fr_741.md) All objects of
enjoyment, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[166:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_742.md) Cf.
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 899. Tapas is variously rendered. See inter alia,
Pra*s*na, pp. 162-70; *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 307; Mu*nd*aka, pp. 270-280,
311-314; *Kh*ândogya, p. 136; Anugîtâ, pp. [247](sbe0831.htm#page_247.md),
[339](sbe0854.htm#page_339.md).

<span id="fn_738"></span>[166:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_743.md) I. e. Brahma-vidyâ,
or science of the Brahman, Nîlaka*nth*a; the Brahman itself,
*S*a<u>n</u>kara.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[166:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_744.md) I. e. lust.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[166:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_745.md) Want of
discrimination between right and wrong.

<span id="fn_741"></span>[166:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_746.md) Desire to taste
worldly objects.

<span id="fn_742"></span>[166:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_747.md) For the loss of
anything desired.

<span id="fn_743"></span>[166:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_748.md) Desire to enjoy
worldly objects. The difference between this and craving, according to
*S*a<u>n</u>kara, appears to be between merely tasting and continual
enjoyment. According to Nîlaka*nth*a, the former is a desire which is
never contented; the latter is merely a general liking.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[166:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_749.md) Impatience of other
people's prosperity; censoriousness being the pointing out of flaws in
other people's merits; and reviling being an ignoring of the merits and
merely abusing.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[167:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_750.md) Scil. for attaining
to the Brahman.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[167:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_751.md) Some weak point by
which they may attack a man.

<span id="fn_747"></span>[167:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_752.md) Fickle in
friendship, &c.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[167:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_753.md) Such as a wife, &c.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[167:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_754.md) Connected with this
or the next world, Nîlaka*nth*a. This and a stanza further on I place
within brackets, as it is not quite certain whether *S*a<u>n</u>kara's
copy had them, though they are now in some of our copies of the text
with his commentary. See Introduction.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[167:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_755.md) Cf. Mu*nd*aka, p.
319; *Kh*ândogya, p. 494.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[167:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_756.md) See note , at page
[165](#page_165.md).

<span id="fn_752"></span>[167:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_757.md) The wife having no
other protector.

<span id="fn_753"></span>[167:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_758.md) See note , at page
[162](sbe0823.htm#page_162.md).

<span id="fn_754"></span>[167:10](sbe0824.htm#fr_759.md) Of pairs of
opposites, such as heat and cold, &c.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[167:11](sbe0824.htm#fr_760.md) Restraint of
senses in presence of their objects.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[167:12](sbe0824.htm#fr_761.md) Cf. Gîtâ, pp.
[69](sbe0808.htm#page_69), [70](sbe0808.htm#page_70.md).

<span id="fn_757"></span>[167:13](sbe0824.htm#fr_762.md) Which are
serviceable in attaining the highest goal.

<span id="fn_758"></span>[168:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_763.md) The original is the
word 'taciturnity' as at [p. 162](sbe0823.htm#page_162.md) supra.

<span id="fn_759"></span>[168:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_764.md) Offering one's acts
to God (Nîlaka*nth*a), as to which cf. Gîtâ, [p.
64](sbe0807.htm#page_64). See also [p. 182](sbe0825.htm#page_182.md) infra
for this stanza.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[168:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_765.md) I. e. for objects
of sense.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[168:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_766.md) Ignorance.

<span id="fn_762"></span>[168:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_767.md) Discontent even
when one obtains much.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[168:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_768.md) This is active;
antipathy is passive only.

<span id="fn_764"></span>[168:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_769.md) Of oneself, by
brooding on evil. Cf. Taittirîya, p. 119. One copy of *S*a<u>n</u>kara's
commentary says this means 'thinking ill of others without cause.'

<span id="fn_765"></span>[168:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_770.md) Of pairs of
opposites.

<span id="fn_766"></span>[168:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_771.md) Restraint of senses
in presence of their objects.

<span id="fn_767"></span>[168:10](sbe0824.htm#fr_772.md) I. e. of piety,
knowledge, and indifference to worldly objects.

<span id="fn_768"></span>[168:11](sbe0824.htm#fr_773.md) I. e. qualities
which destroy it.

<span id="fn_769"></span>[168:12](sbe0824.htm#fr_774.md) Scil. as defects
of self-restraint, viz. untruthfulness, &c.

<span id="fn_770"></span>[169:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_775.md) Scil. any
distinction as to physical, mental, or that which is caused by
superhuman agency.

<span id="fn_771"></span>[169:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_776.md) Literally, 'all is
conquered.' Everything that needs to be done is done. Cf.
Ka*th*opanishad, p. 155; Mu*nd*aka, p. 317.

<span id="fn_772"></span>[169:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_777.md) Another
interpretation of ish*t*apûrta is 'offerings to gods, and 'offerings to
the manes;' a third 'sacrifices, &c., and works of charity, such as
digging tanks and wells;' for a fourth, see *S*a<u>n</u>kara on
Mu*nd*aka, p. 291.

<span id="fn_773"></span>[169:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_778.md) Each of the three
classes mentioned contains two sub-classes, and so the six are made up.
It is not quite easy to see the two heads under the third class; but
perhaps indifference, and the consequent abandonment of desire, may be
the two intended. To indicate that, I have adopted the construction
which takes the words 'by means of indifference' with abandonment,
instead of with 'gifts at Vedic ceremonies,' &c. *S*a<u>n</u>kara seems
to understand 'giving away of wealth' with the words 'by means of
indifference,' and thus to constitute the second head under the third
class. But he is not quite clear.

<span id="fn_774"></span>[169:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_779.md) Concentration =
fixing the mind continuously on some object, such as the being in the
sun, &c.; contemplation is that in which one identifies oneself with the
Brahman; reflexion as to what one is, whence one comes, and so forth.

<span id="fn_775"></span>[169:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_780.md) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
says this may refer to the 'stealing' mentioned at [p.
160](sbe0823.htm#page_160.md). The life of a Brahma*k*ârin is here taken to
mean <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> continence by the commentators,
as also at Mu*nd*aka, p. 311 inter alia. See also *Kh*ândogya, p. 533.

<span id="fn_776"></span>[170:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_781.md) Son, wife, home,
&c.; as to which cf. Gîtâ, [p. 103](sbe0815.htm#page_103.md), and
N*ri*si*m*ha Tâpinî, p. 198, commentary.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[170:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_782.md) The eight mentioned
already.

<span id="fn_778"></span>[170:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_783.md) Cf. Taitt. Âra*n*.
p. 885.

<span id="fn_779"></span>[170:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_784.md) Cf. Mu*nd*aka, p.
312; *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha), chap. 199, st. 64 seq. Immortality = final
emancipation.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[170:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_785) [p. 165](#page_165.md)
supra.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[170:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_786.md) Of penance, that is
to say.

<span id="fn_782"></span>[170:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_787.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
109](sbe0816.htm#page_109.md) for the collocation.

<span id="fn_783"></span>[170:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_788.md) Ka*th*opanishad, p.
151; Maitrî, p. 161. *S*a<u>n</u>kara, seems to take the five and the
senses separately; the five meaning the five classes of sensuous
objects.

<span id="fn_784"></span>[170:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_789.md) Past losses and
future gains, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[171:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_790.md) Cf., as to this,
Max Müller's Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 38 seq.; and *Kh*ândogya,
pp. 164, 474, 493; B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, pp. 456, 687, 926; Maitrî, p.
171; Nrisimha Tâpinî, p. 105.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[171:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_791.md) The original is
'void of *Rik*s.' The commentators give no explanation. Does it mean
those who abandon the karma-mârga? Heretics who reject all Vedas are
scarcely likely to be referred to in this way. Nîlaka*nth*a's
interpretation of all this is very different. See his gloss.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[171:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_792.md) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
gives various interpretations of this. Perhaps the best is to take it as
meaning knowledge. 'The one knowledge--the one truth'--would then be
like the famous text--Taittirîya, p. 56--'The Brahman is truth,
knowledge,' &c.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[171:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_793.md) For this phrase cf.
Gîtâ, [p. 73](sbe0808.htm#page_73.md).

<span id="fn_789"></span>[171:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_794.md) Those who do not
understand the Brahman lose their natural power of obtaining what they
wish, and so go in for various ceremonies for various special benefits.
Cf. *Kh*ândogya, p. 541; Gîtâ, [p. 47](sbe0804.htm#page_47.md); and [p.
184](sbe0825.htm#page_184.md) infra.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[171:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_795.md) Cf.
B*ri*hadâranyaka, p. 893.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[171:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_796.md) Ibid. p. 636.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[171:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_797.md) Literally, 'highest
among bipeds,' a rather unusual expression.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[171:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_798.md) Nîlaka*nth*a says,
'The part of the Vedas which teaches the <span id="page_172">p.
172</span> knowledge of the supreme is enough by itself for its purpose;
it is not like the part about rites, &c., which rites must be performed
before they serve any useful purpose.' The *G*ñânakânda is enough by
itself for understanding the Brahman. *S*a<u>n</u>kara compares Gîtâ,
[p. 113](sbe0817.htm#page_113.md), and Ka*th*a, p. 102.

<span id="fn_794"></span>[172:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_799.md) The Veda = the
Brahman, as above, cf. *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 372 and commentary; that
which is to be known = the material world, which is a subject for human
knowledge.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[172:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_800.md) Scil. understands
the Veda--the Brahman.

<span id="fn_796"></span>[172:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_801.md) 'The mind,' says
Nîlaka*nth*a; literally, 'that which is to be understood.'

<span id="fn_797"></span>[172:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_802.md) Because a real
knowledge of it requires a knowledge of the Brahman. As to the next
clause cf. inter alia *Kh*ândogya, p. 384; B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 450.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[172:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_803.md) This is the
converse of the last sentence, as to which cf. B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p.
925.

<span id="fn_799"></span>[172:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_804.md) The supreme.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[172:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_805.md) The apparent
contradiction is explained in the next sentence.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[172:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_806.md) I. e. the moon.
This refers to the well-known *s*âkhâ*k*andranyâya. As the small digit
of the moon, which cannot be perceived by itself, is pointed out as
being at the tip of a branch of a tree pointing towards the moon, so the
Vedas are of use as pointing towards the Brahman, though inaccurately
and imperfectly.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[173:1](sbe0824.htm#fr_807.md) Scil. in the manner
just indicated.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[173:2](sbe0824.htm#fr_808.md) As giving an idea
of the Brahman. The first step to a knowledge of the Brahman is to
'hear' about it from Vedic texts. Cf. B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 925.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[173:3](sbe0824.htm#fr_809.md) Such as the body,
the senses, &c., which must be distinguished as quite distinct from the
self, though most often confounded with it.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[173:4](sbe0824.htm#fr_810.md) Such passages,
namely, as 'Thou art that, I am the Brahman,' &c.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[173:5](sbe0824.htm#fr_811.md) About the objects
of the senses.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[173:6](sbe0824.htm#fr_812.md) Cf. Ka*th*a, p. 55.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[173:7](sbe0824.htm#fr_813.md) Cf. *Kh*ândogya, p.
516. The Bhûman there is the same as the Bahu here, viz. the Brahman.
*S*a<u>n</u>kara says expressly in his comment on the Upanishad text,
that Bahu and Bhûman, among other words, are synonyms.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[173:8](sbe0824.htm#fr_814.md) Self-restraint, as
explained before at [p. 163](#page_163.md).

<span id="fn_810"></span>[173:9](sbe0824.htm#fr_815.md) Though this is not
unimportant, as may be seen from the contrast between town and forest at
*Kh*ândogya, p. 340. See also Maitrî, p. 100; Mu*nd*aka, p. 240. As to
the 'highest sage,' see B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 899, where the passage
about 'sacrifice, gift, penance' should be compared with Gîtâ, [p.
122](sbe0820.htm#page_122.md).

<span id="fn_811"></span>[173:10](sbe0824.htm#fr_816.md) The construction
in the original is not quite clear. I understand the sense to be as
follows: In the science of the soul, the <span id="page_174">p.
174</span> analyser (the word is the same as the word for grammarian) is
he who analyses objects, not words merely. Now the true analysis of
objects reduces them all to the Brahman (cf. *Kh*ândogya, p. 407;
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 152); and the sage understands this, and makes
the analysis accordingly, so he is rightly called an analyser.
