# INTRODUCTION TO ANUGÎTÂ.

LIKE the Bhagavadgîtâ and the Sanatsu*g*âtîya, the Anugîtâ, is one of
the numerous episodes of the Mahâbhârata. And like the Sanatsu*g*âtîya,
it appears here for the first time in an English, or, indeed, it is
believed, in any European garb. It forms part of the A*s*vamedha Parvan
of the Mahâbhârata, and is contained in thirty-six chapters of that
Parvan. These chapters--being chapters XVI to LI--together with all the
subsequent chapters of the A*s*vamedha Parvan, form by themselves what
in some of our copies is called the Anugîtâ Parvan-a title which affords
a parallel to the title Bhagavadgîtâ Parvan, which we have already
referred to. The Anugîtâ is not now a work of any very great or
extensive reputation. But we do find some few quotations from it in the
Bhâshyas of Sa<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya, and one or two in the
Sa<u>n</u>khya-sâra of Vi*g*ñâna Bhikshu, to which reference will be
made hereafter. And it is included in the present volume, partly because
it affords an interesting, glimpse of sundry old passages of the
Upanishad literature in a somewhat modified, and presumably later, form;
and partly, perhaps I may say more especially, because it professes to
be a sort of continuation, or rather recapitulation, of the
Bhagavadgîtâ. At the very outset of the work, we read, that, after the
great fratricidal war of the Mahâbhârata was over, and the Pâ*nd*avas
had become sole and complete masters of their ancestral kingdom,
K*ri*sh*n*a and Ar*g*una--the two interlocutors in the
Bhagavadgîtâ--happened to take a stroll together in the great magical
palace built for the Pâ*nd*avas by the demon Maya. In the course of the
conversation which they held on the occasion, K*ri*sh*n*a communicated
to Ar*g*una his wish to return to his own people at Dvârakâ, now that
the business which had called

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

him away from them was happily terminated. Ar*g*una, of course, was
unable to resist the execution of this wish; but he requested Krishna,
before leaving for Dvârakâ, to repeat the instruction which had been
already conveyed to him on 'the holy field of Kurukshetra,' but which
had gone out of his 'degenerate mind.' K*ri*sh*n*a thereupon protests
that he is not equal to a verbatim recapitulation of the Bhagavadgîtâ,
but agrees, in lieu of that, to impart to Ar*g*una the same instruction
in other words, through the medium of a certain 'ancient story'--or
purâtana itihâsa. And the instruction thus conveyed constitutes what is
called the Anugîtâ, a name which is in itself an embodiment of this
anecdote.

Now the first question which challenges investigation with reference to
this work is, if we may so call it, the fundamental one-how much is
properly included under the name? The question is not one quite easy of
settlement, as our authorities upon it are not all reconcilable with one
another. In the general list of contents of the A*s*vamedha Parvan,
which is given at the end of that Parvan in the edition printed at
Bombay, we read that the first section is the Vyâsa Vâkya, the second
the Samvartamaruttîya. With neither of these have we aught to do here.
The list then goes on thus: 'Anugîtâ, Vâsudevâgamana, Brâhma*n*a Gîtâ,
Guru*s*ishyasamvâda, Uttankopâkhyâna,' and so forth. With the later
sections, again, we arc not here concerned. Now let us compare this list
with the list which may be obtained from the titles of the chapters in
the body of the work itself. With the sixteenth chapter, then, of the
A*s*vamedha Parvan, begins what is here called the Anugîtâ Parvan; and
that chapter and the three following chapters are described as the
sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth chapters respectively
of the Anugîtâ Parvan, which forms part of the A*s*vamedha Parvan. The
title of the twentieth chapter contains a small, but important,
addition. It runs thus, 'Such is the twentieth chapter of the Anugîtâ
Parvan, forming part of the A*s*vamedha Parvan--being the Brahma Gîtâ'
This form is continued down to the thirty-fourth chapter, only
Brâhma*n*a

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Gîtâ being substituted for Brahma Gîtâ. At the
close of the thirty-fifth chapter, there is another alteration caused by
the substitution of Guru*s*ishyasamvâda for Brâhma*n*a Gîtâ; and this
continues down to the fifty-first chapter, where the thread of the
narrative is again taken up--the philosophical parenthesis, if I may so
say, having come to an end. With the fifty-first chapter our present
translation also ends. Now it appears from the above comparison., that
the list of contents set out above is accurate, save in so far as it
mentions Vâsudevâgamana as a distinct section of the A*s*vamedha Parvan.
No such section seems to be in existence. And there appears to be
nothing in the A*s*vamedha Parvan to which that title could be
appropriately allotted. The edition printed at Madras agrees in all
essential particulars with the Bombay edition; with this difference,
that even at the close of the twentieth chapter, the name is Brâhma*n*a
Gîtâ, and not Brahma Gîtâ as it is in the Bombay edition. The Calcutta
edition also agrees in these readings. Turning now to a MS. procured for
me by my excellent friend Professor Âbâ*g*î Vish*n*u Kâthava*t*e at
Ahmedabad, and bearing date the 15th of Phâlguna Vadya 1823, Sunday, we
find there at the end of the A*s*vamedha Parvan a list of contents like
that which we have seen in the printed edition. The relevant portion of
that list is as follows: 'Samvartamaruttîya, Anugîtâ,
Guru*s*ishyasa*m*vâda, and Uttankopâkhyâna.' Here we find neither the
erroneous entry of Vâsudevâgamana, nor the correct entry of Brahma Gîtâ,
which are both contained in the other list. In another MS. which I have
now before me, and which has been lent me by Professor Bhâ*nd*ârkar, who
purchased it in Puna for the Government of Bombay--in this MS., which
contains the commentary of Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, the earlier chapters are
described not as chapters of the Anugîtâ Parvan, but of the Anugîtâ
contained in the A*s*vamedha Parvan, and they are numbered there as they
are numbered in our translation, not continuously with the numbering of
the previous chapters of the A*s*vamedha Parvan. At the close of chapter
IV, we have an explicit statement that the Anugîtâ ends there. Then the
Brahma Gîtâ begins. And the first chapter is

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

described as a chapter of the Brahma Gîtâ in the A*s*vamedha Parvan. The
numbering of each of these chapters of the Brahma Gîtâ is not given in.
the copy before us--the titles and descriptions of the various chapters
being throughout incomplete. Some of the later chapters are described as
chapters of the Brâhma Gîtâ, and some as chapters of the Brâhma*n*a
Gîtâ; but this discrepancy is probably to be put to the account of the
particular copyist who wrote out the copy used by us. With what is
chapter XX in our numbering the Guru*s*ishyasa*m*vâda begins. This MS.
omits all reference to any Anugîtâ Parvan, and fails to number the
various chapters. Its list of sections agrees with that in the Bombay
edition. It bears no date.

So much for what may be described as our primary sources of information
on this subject. Let us now glance at the secondary sources. And, first,
Nîlaka*nth*a in commenting on what is, according to his numbering,
chapter XV, stanza 43, apparently distinguishes that chapter from what
he speaks of as the Brâhma*n*a Gîtâ and Guru*s*ishyasa*m*vâda, which he
implies follow after that chapter--thus indicating that he accepted in
substance the tradition re corded in the passages We have already set
forth, viz. that the first four chapters of our translation form the
Anugîtâ, the next fifteen the Brâhma*n*a Gîtâ, and the last seventeen
the Guru*s*ishyasa*m*vâda. This is also the view of Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. At
the close of his gloss on chapter IV, he distinctly states that the
Anugîtâ ends at that chapter; and again at the close of the gloss on
chapter XIX, he explicitly says that the Brâhma*n*a Gîtâ ends there. He
also adds the following interesting observation: 'The feminine form
(Gîtâ, namely) is used in consequence of (the word) Upanishad being
feminine.' The full title of that part of the Mahâbhârata would then be,
according to this remark of Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, 'the Upanishads sung by
the Brâhma*n*a,' a title parallel to that of the Bhagavadgîtâ, 'the
Upanishads sung by the Deity.' It is to be further remarked, that the
last chapter of the Guru*s*ishyasa*m*vâda is called in this commentary
the eighteenth chapter of the Guru*s*ishyasa*m*vâda, a fact which seems
to indicate that Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra either found

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

in the MS. which he used, or himself established, a separate numbering
for the chapters in the several sections <span
id="fr_983"></span>[1](#fn_978.md) of which the A*s*vamedha Parvan is made
up.

Although the information here set out from these various sources is not
easily to be harmonised in all its parts, the preponderance of testimony
seems to he in favour of regarding the portion of the A*s*vamedha Parvan
embraced in our translation as containing three distinct sections, viz.
the Anugîtâ, the Brâhma*n*a Gîtâ, and the Guru*s*ishyasa*m*vâda. And
some indirect support may be derived for this conclusion, from one or
two other circumstances. In the Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra of Vi*g*ñâna
Bhikshu--a work which, as we shall see in the sequel, expressly mentions
the Anugîtâ--we have a passage cited as from the 'Bhârata <span
id="fr_984"></span>[2](#fn_979.md)' which coincides almost precisely with a
passage occurring at chapter XXVII of our translation (see p. 335). And,
in the Bhâshya of *S*a<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya, on the Bhagavadgîtâ, chapter
XV, stanza 1, we have a citation as from a 'Purâ*n*a' of a passage which
coincides pretty closely with one which occurs at chapter XX of our
translation (see [p. 313](sbe0847.htm#page_313).md). If the discrepancies
between the quotations as given by Vi*g*ñâna Bhikshu and
*S*a<u>n</u>kara, and the passages occurring in our text, may be treated
merely as various readings-and there is nothing inherently improbable in
this being the case-it may be fairly contended, that neither
*S*a<u>n</u>kara nor Vi*g*ñâna Bhikshu would have used the vague
expressions, 'a Purâ*n*a,' or even 'the Bhârata,' if they could have
correctly substituted in lieu of them the specific name Anugîtâ. And
this, it may be said, is a contention of some weight, when it is
remembered, that both *S*a<u>n</u>kara and Vi*g*ñâna show, in other
parts of their writings, an acquaintance with this very Anugîtâ. If this
reasoning is correct,

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

the conclusion to be derived from it must be, that *S*a<u>n</u>kara and
Vi*g*ñâna must have considered the chapters of the A*s*vamedha Parvan
from which their respective quotations are taken as not forming part of
the Anugîtâ.

The testimony we have thus collected is apparently of considerable
weight. Against it, however, we have to weigh some testimony which
appears to me to be entitled, upon the whole, to even greater weight. In
the Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra of Vi*g*ñâna Bhikshu, to which we have already
referred, we have two quotations <span id="fr_985"></span>[1](#fn_980.md)
from the Anugîtâ which are distinctly stated to be taken from that work.
The first occurs in our translation at [p. 332](sbe0852.htm#page_332.md),
the second at [p. 313](sbe0847.htm#page_313.md). Now, if we adopt the
conclusion above referred to, regarding the correct titles of the
thirty-six chapters which we have translated, it is a mistake to
attribute the passages in question to the Anugîtâ. They would, on that
view, form part of the Guru*s*ishyasa*m*vâda. Again, in his commentary
on the Sanatsu*g*âtîya, *S*a<u>n</u>kara refers to sundry passages which
he expressly says are taken from the Anugîtâ, but which are not
contained in the Anugîtâ as limited by the evidence we have considered
above. One of the passages referred to is taken from chapter XI of our
translation, and others are contained in the comments on Sanatsu*g*âtîya
I, 6, and on I, 20 and I, 41 <span id="fr_986"></span>[2](#fn_981.md). It
is difficult to resist the conclusion to which this positive evidence
leads. One cannot possibly explain this evidence upon the view which we
have first stated; while, on the other hand, the points which apparently
support that view are capable of some explanation on the theory that the
Anugîtâ includes all the chapters here translated. And that in this
wise. The passages which we have referred to as cited by
*S*a<u>n</u>kara and Vi*g*ñâna from a Purâna and from the Bhârata may
have been actually taken from some other work than the Anugîtâ. Even
waiving the fact that the readings are different,--though in regard
especially to the quotation given by *S*a<u>n</u>kara it is not one to
be entirely lost sight of,--there is this fact which is of great and
almost conclusive weight on such a point as this, namely, that we

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

have many instances of passages common, almost verbatim et literatim, to
the Mahâbhârata and other works. For one instance, take the very passage
on which a chronological argument has been founded by us in the
Introduction to the Sanatsu*g*âtîya <span
id="fr_987"></span>[1](#fn_982.md). It ought to have been there pointed
out, that the stanza about a young man being bound to rise to receive an
elderly person, also occurs in the Manu Sm*ri*ti <span
id="fr_988"></span>[2](#fn_983.md) in exactly the same words. The omission
to note this circumstance in its proper place in the Introduction to the
Sanatsu*g*âtîya was due to a mere inadvertence. But the conclusion there
hinted at was expressed in very, cautious language, and with many
qualifications, out of regard to circumstances such as those which we
are now considering. Similar repetitions may be pointed out in other
places. The passage about the Kshetra*g*ña and Sattva and their mutual
relations (see [p. 374](sbe0860.htm#page_374).md) occurs, as pointed out in
the note there,. in at least two other places in the Mahâbhârata. The
passage likewise which occurs at Gîtâ, [p. 103](sbe0815.htm#page_103.md),
about the 'hands, feet, &c., on all sides,' is one which may be seen, to
my own knowledge, in about half a dozen places in the Mahâbhârata. Such
cases, I believe, may be easily multiplied; and they illustrate and are
illustrated by Mr. Freeman's proposition respecting the epic age in
Greece, to which we have already alluded. It follows, consequently, that
the quotations from *S*a<u>n</u>kara and Vi*g*ñâna, to which we have
referred above, do not militate very strongly against the final
conclusion at which we have arrived. The testimony of the MSS. and the
commentators is, no doubt, of considerably greater force. But
Nîlaka*nth*a, whatever his merits as an exegete--and even these are
often marred by a persistent effort to read his own foregone conclusions
into the text he comments on Nîlaka*nth*a is but an indifferent
authority in the domain of historical criticism. In his commentary on
the Sanatsu*g*âtîya, for instance, he tells us that he has admitted into
his text sundry verses which were not in the copy used by
*S*a<u>n</u>kara, and for which he had none but a very modern voucher,
and he very naively adds that he has done so

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

on the principle of collecting all good things to a focus. Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra is a very much more satisfactory commentator. But he is not
likely to be a writer of much antiquity. I assume, that he must be more
recent than Sa<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya, though I cannot say that I have any
very tenable ground for the assumption. But assuming that, I think it
more satisfactory to adopt Sa<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya's nomenclature, and to
treat the thirty-six chapters here translated as constituting the
Anugîtâ. It is not improbable, if our assumption is correct, that the
division of the thirty-six chapters in the manner we have seen may have
come into vogue after the date of Vi*g*ñâna Bhikshu, who, according to
Dr. F. E. Hall, 'lived in all probability in the sixteenth or
seventeenth century, and whom there is some slight reason for carrying
back still further <span id="fr_989"></span>[1](#fn_984.md).'

Do these thirty-six chapters, then, form one integral work? Are they all
the work of one and the same author? These are the questions which next
present themselves for consideration. The evidence bearing upon them,
however, is, as might be expected, excessively scanty. Of external
evidence, indeed, we have really none, barring *S*a<u>n</u>kara's
statement in his commentary on the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka-upanishad <span
id="fr_990"></span>[2](#fn_985.md) that the verse which he there quotes
from the Anugîtâ has Vyâsa for its author. That statement indicates that
*S*a<u>n</u>kara accepted the current tradition of Vyâsa's authorship of
the Anugîtâ; and such acceptance, presumably, followed from his
acceptance of the tradition of Vyâsa's authorship of the entire
Mahâbhârata. If that tradition is incorrect, and Vyâsa is not the author
of the Anugîtâ, we have no means of ascertaining who is the author. And
as to the tradition in question, it is difficult, in the present state
of our materials, to form any satisfactory judgment. We therefore
proceed at once to consider whether the Anugîtâ is really one work. And
I must admit at the outset that I find it difficult to answer this
question. There are certainly some circumstances connected with the work
which might be regarded as indicating

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

a different authorship of different parts of it. Thus in an early
portion of the work, we find the first personal pronoun is used, where
the Supreme Being is evidently intended to be signified, and yet the
passage is not put into the mouth of K*ri*sh*n*a, but of the Brâhma*n*a.
A similar passage occurs a little later on also. Now it must be taken to
be a somewhat strained interpretation of the words used in the passages
in question to suppose that the speaker there used the first personal
pronoun, identifying himself for the nonce with the Supreme Being <span
id="fr_991"></span>[1](#fn_986.md). Again, in a passage still further on,
we have the vocative O Pârtha! where the person addressed is not
Ar*g*una at all, but the Brâhma*n*a's wife. Now these lapses are
susceptible of two explanations--either we are to see in them so many
cases of 'Homer nodding,' or we may suppose that they are errors
occasioned by one writer making additions to the work of a previous
writer, without a vivid recollection of the framework of the original
composition into which his own work had to be set <span
id="fr_992"></span>[2](#fn_987.md). I own, that on balancing the
probabilities on the one side and the other, my mind rather leans to the
hypothesis of one author making a slip in the plexus of his own story
within story, rather than the hypothesis of a deliberate interpolator
forgetting the actual scheme of the original work into which he was
about to foist his own additions <span id="fr_993"></span>[3](#fn_988.md).
And this the rather, that we find a similar slip towards the very
beginning of the work, where we have the Brâhma*n*a Kâ*s*yapa addressed
as Parantapa, or destroyer of foes--an epithet which, I think, is
exclusively reserved for Kshatriyas, and is, in any case, a very
inappropriate one to apply to a humble seeker for spiritual light. This
slip appears to me to be incapable of explanation on any theory of
interpolation <span id="fr_994"></span>[4](#fn_989.md). And hence the other
slips above noted can hardly be regarded as supporting any such theory.
Another circumstance, not indeed bearing

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

out that theory, but rendering interpolations possible, deserves to be
noted. The scheme of the Anugîtâ certainly lends itself to
interpolations. A story might without much difficulty be added to the
series of story joined to story which it contains. Against this,
however, it must not be forgotten, that the *S*ânti Parvan of the
Mahâbhârata, and the Yogavâsish*th*a exhibit a precisely similar
framework of contents, and that the Pañ*k*atantra and the
Kathâsaritsâgara, among other works, follow the same model. And from
this fact it may, be fairly argued, that while there is, doubtless, room
for suspecting interpolations in such cases, there is this to be
remembered, that with respect to any particular one of these cases, such
suspicion can carry us but a very short way. And further, it is to be
observed, valeat quantum, that the connexion of the several chapters of
the Anugîtâ one with the other is not altogether a loose one, save at
one or two points only, while they are all linked on to the main body of
the narrative, only in what we have treated as the last chapter of the
Anugîtâ, without any trace of any other connecting link anywhere else.
Upon the whole, therefore, we here conclude, though not without doubt,
that the whole of the Anugîtâ is the work of one author.

The next question to be discussed is the important one of the age of the
work. The quotations already given above from Sa<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya's
works, and one other which is referred to in the note below <span
id="fr_995"></span>[1](#fn_990.md), suffice to show that the Anugîtâ must
have been some few centuries old in the time of Sa<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya.
For whether we treat the Anugîtâ as a part of the original Mahâbhârata
or not, it is not likely that such a scholar as *S*a<u>n</u>kara would
have accepted the book as a genuine part of the Mahâbhârata, and as a
work of Vyâsa, if it had not been in his day of some respectable
antiquity, of antiquity sufficient to have thrown the real author into
oblivion, and to have substituted

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

in his place Vyâsa, who lived at the junction of the Dvâpara and Kali
ages <span id="fr_996"></span>[1](#fn_991.md), upwards of thirty centuries
before the Christian era. The calculation is avowedly a very rough one,
but I think we may, as the result of it, safely fix the third century of
the Christian era as the latest date at which the Anugîtâ can have been
composed. Let us now endeavour to find out whether we can fix the date
as lying within any better defined period. It is scarcely needful to
say, that the Anugîtâ dates from a period considerably subsequent to the
age of the Upanishads. The passages relating to the Prâ*n*asa*m*vâda and
so forth, which occur originally in the Upanishads, are referred to in
the Anugîtâ as 'ancient stories'--an indication that the Upanishads had
already come to be esteemed as ancient compositions at the date of the
latter work. It is not necessary, therefore, to go through an elaborate
examination of the versions of the ancient stories alluded to above, as
contained in the Upanishads and in the Anugîtâ, more especially because
it is possible for us to show that the Anugîtâ is later than the
Bhagavadgîtâ, which latter work, as we have seen, is later than the
Upanishads. And to this point we shall now address ourselves. We have
already observed upon the story referred to at the opening of this
Introduction, which, historically interpreted, indicates the priority of
the Bhagavadgîtâ to the Anugîtâ. This conclusion is confirmed by sundry
other circumstances, which we must now discuss in some detail, as they
are also of use in helping to fix the position of the work in the
history of Sanskrit literature and philosophy. First, then, it seems to
me, that the state of society mirrored in the Anugîtâ indicates a
greater advance in social evolution than we have already seen is
disclosed in the Bhagavadgîtâ. Not to mention decorations of houses and
so forth, which are alluded to in one passage of the Anugîtâ, we are
here told of royal oppressions, of losses of wealth accumulated with
great difficulty, and of fierce captivities; we are told, to adapt the
language of a modern English poet, of laws grinding the weak, for strong
men rule the

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

law; we have references to the casting of images with liquefied iron,
and to the use of elephants as vehicles <span
id="fr_997"></span>[1](#fn_992.md); and we meet with protests against the
amusements of music and dancing, and against the occupation of
artisans <span id="fr_998"></span>[2](#fn_993.md). True it is, that all
these indications put together, fail to constitute according to the
standard of modern times, would be called a highly artificial state of
society. But it seems to me to mark a very perceptible and distinct
advance beyond the social condition in which mankind was divided into
four castes or classes, with such a division of duties, to put it
briefly, as that of preparation for a future world, government of this
world, agriculture and trade, and service respectively <span
id="fr_999"></span>[3](#fn_994.md). Artisans, it will be observed, are not
even referred to in the Bhagavadgîtâ, nor is there any trice of royal
oppressions, or unequal laws. Then as regards music, it may be noted,
that there are references to it in the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka and
Kaushîtaki-upanishads <span id="fr_1000"></span>[4](#fn_995.md), without
any indications of disapprobation. The protest against music, therefore,
and the sister art of dancing, is probably to be explained as evoked by
some abuses of the two arts which must have come into prevalence about
the time of the composition of the Anugîtâ. A similar protest is found
recorded in the Dharma*s*âstras of Manu and Âpastamba and Gautama <span
id="fr_1001"></span>[5](#fn_996.md). We shall consider in the sequel the
chronological positions of the Anugîtâ with reference to those
Dharmasâstras. But we have already pointed out that the Gîtâ stands
prior to them both <span id="fr_1002"></span>[6](#fn_997.md).

Look again at the views on caste which are embodied in the Anugîtâ, and
the Bhagavadgîtâ respectively. The reference to the Kshatriya as
representing the quality of passion, while the Brâhma*n*a represents the
quality of goodness <span id="fr_1003"></span>[7](#fn_998.md), seems to
place a considerably larger distance between the Brâhma*n*a, and the
Kshatriya than is suggested by the Bhagavadgîtâ, and thus marks an
advance in the direction of the later doctrine on the subject. And in
connexion

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

with this, perhaps, the discrepancy between the reading of the
Bhagavadgîtâ at [p. 85](sbe0811.htm#page_85.md), and that of the Anugîtâ at
[p. 255](sbe0831.htm#page_255.md), is not entirely without significance,
though much weight would not be due to it, if it stood alone. The
expression 'devoted royal sages,' which we find in- the one work, makes
way for 'well-read Kshatriyas who are intent on their own duties' in the
other. Again, although the passage at [p. 353](sbe0856.htm#page_353.md) is
undoubtedly susceptible of a different interpretation, it seems to me,
that the word 'twice-born' there employed, was meant to be interpreted
as meaning the Brâhma*n*as, and not the three twice-born castes; and if
this interpretation is correct, we have here the very proposition upon
the absence of which in the Bhagavadgîtâ we have already made some
observations <span id="fr_1004"></span>[1](#fn_999.md). That twice-born in
the passage in question means Brâhma*n*a only, is, of course, not a
proved fact. But-having regard to the passages noted above and to the
passage at [p. 320](sbe0848.htm#page_320.md), where reference is made to
disparagement of Brâhma*n*as--it is not twice-born there--and in the
same clause with disparagement of gods and Vedas, it seems to me that
the interpretation we have suggested must be taken to be the true one.
And it is to be further noted, that this conclusion is corroborated by a
comparison of the passage now under consideration with a passage
occurring in the *S*ânti Parvan <span id="fr_1005"></span>[2](#fn_1000.md),
in the Râ*g*adharma section of it, where we read that 'the cow is the
first among quadrupeds, gold among metals, a mantra among words, and the
Brâhma*n*a is the first among bipeds.' The cow and gold occur in the
passage in the Anugîtâ also, very near the clause we are now discussing.
And it is allowable to argue, that reading the two together, twice-born
in the Anugîtâ must be interpreted to be synonymous with Brâhma*n*a in
the Râ*g*adharma. And the same conclusion is, to my mind, confirmed
indirectly by comparing the clause 'the twice-born among men' of the
Anugîtâ with 'the ruler of men among men of that Bhagavadgîtâ, the
teaching of which the former work professes to recapitulate.

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

A similar inference seems to be derivable from a comparison of the
specific doctrines as to the duties of Brâhma*n*as which are enunciated
in the Gîtâ and the Anugîtâ. In the latter work, the famous six duties
are expressly mentioned. We have already argued in our Introduction to
the Gîtâ, that a comparison of the teaching of that work upon this point
with the teaching of Âpastamba and Manu shows the former to have been
older than the latter. The six duties mentioned in the Anugîtâ are those
also mentioned by Manu and Âpastamba. It follows, therefore, that the
Gîtâ is prior to the Anugîtâ also. Whether the Anugîtâ is prior or
subsequent to Manu and Âpastamba, is a question which will have to be
discussed in the sequel.

The net result of the whole of this comparison appears to me to clearly
show the Anugîtâ to be a work of considerably more recent date than the
Bhagavadgîtâ. What interval of time lay between the two, is a most
interesting, but also a most difficult, question. The differences we
have noted appear to me to indicate a pretty wide interval. If I am
right in regarding the Gîtâ as a work of what may be called, for
practical purposes, the age of the older Upanishads, I am inclined to
think that the interval between the Gîtâ, and the Anugîtâ must have been
one of larger extent than even three or four centuries. For as we have
already pointed put, the description of the various 'Itihâsas' mentioned
in the Anugîtâ as 'purâtana'--ancient--points to at least three or four
centuries having elapsed between the close of the Upanishad period and
the composition of the Anugîtâ. It is obvious, however, that this result
is not one with which we can rest satisfied. Even if it were more
precise and accurate, it would only fix the age of the Anugîtâ with
reference to the age of another work itself of unknown and unascertained
date. We must therefore endeavour to compare the Anugîtâ with some other
work, the date of which is better known. For this purpose, it seems to
be not of any great use to refer to the Sankhya and Yoga-sûtras,
although it is not improbable that some materials might be forthcoming
for a useful comparison between them and the Anugîtâ. Neither the
Sâ<u>n</u>khya nor the Yoga-sûtras can

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

be said to have their ages fixed with even any approach to accuracy. And
in the case of the Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sûtras there is the further difficulty
presented by the circumstance, that there is room for very serious
doubts as to whether the current Sûtras are really of the authorship of
Kapila, or whoever else was the original founder of the system. With
regard to the Yoga, one or two observations from a different point of
view may not, however, be entirely out of place. At [p.
248](sbe0831.htm#page_248.md) the Yoga *S*âstra is referred to eo nomine.
What *S*âstra is here alluded to? Is it Patañ*g*ali's, or some other
*S*âstra dealing with similar topics? Or, again, is it an entirely
different matter that is alluded to, and are we not to see in the
expression in question an allusion to any system formally propounded? I
own, as stated in the note on the passage, that my mind inclines to the
last view. There is not very much to say on either side of the question,
as far as I am able to understand it. But the view I incline to appears
to have one small circumstance in its favour. At [p.
249](sbe0831.htm#page_249.md) we have an allusion to persons who understand
the Yoga, and to a certain illustration propounded by them. Now who are
these persons? My limited knowledge of Yoga literature has not enabled
me to trace the illustration anywhere else than in the Ka*th*opanishad,
and in the Sanatsu*g*âtîya. It seems to me very unlikely, that the
illustration can have been put forward in any work older than the
Kathopanishad. And we may, I think, assume it as most probable that the
Sanatsu*g*âtîya borrowed it from that work. If so, it is not likely that
the Anugîtâ can have referred to any other master of the Yoga than, the
author of the Kathopanishad. And then it would seem to follow, that the
Anugîtâ must have been composed at a time when, although the Upanishads
were looked on with reverence and as works of authority, they were not
yet regarded as part and parcel of the Vedic revelation <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[1](#fn_1001.md). It is impossible not to perceive,
that the train of reasoning here is at every stage hedged round with
difficulties and doubts. And the inference therefore to which we are led
by it must be accepted with proportionate

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

caution. But if the reasoning is correct, it seems to be certain, that
the Anugîtâ belongs to some period prior to the second, and probable,
that it belongs to some period prior to the third century, before
Christ. For in the second century before Christ was composed the
Mahâbhâshya of Patañ*g*ali, in which Rahasyas--which is another name for
Upanishads--are mentioned as forming part of the Vedic literature. And
in Âpastamba's Dharma-sûtras, which are older than Patañ*g*ali,
Upanishads <span id="fr_1007"></span>[1](#fn_1002.md) are mentioned in the
same way. I am aware that it may be said, that because Upanishads as a
class of works are mentioned by Patañ*g*ali and Âpastamba, it does not
follow that any particular Upanishad, such as the Ka*th*a, for instance,
also existed at that time. This is quite true. But without going now
into the general question, it is sufficient to point out, that on.
argument here is concerned merely with the recognition of the Upanishads
as a class of works forming part of the Vedic canon. Such recognition
must have come later than the period at which the Anugîtâ could speak of
a passage in the Ka*th*a-upanishad as the utterance of Yogavids, or
persons who understood the Yoga.

Turning now to the materials available for ascertaining the relative
chronological positions of the Anugîtâ and the rise of Buddhism, we have
again to complain of their unsatisfactory character. We will briefly
note the two or three circumstances which appear to have a bearing upon
this question. In the first place, we have the word Nirvâ*n*a used in
one passage of the Anugîtâ in the sense of the highest tranquillity, and
there the simile of the extinction of the fire Is expressly adduced. On
this it may be argued, that if the term Nirvâ*n*a had become the
well-understood property of Buddhism, such a use of it as we find here
would probably not have occurred. Again, we have the injunction that an
ascetic must dwell in a town only for one day and no more, while he may,
stay at one place during the rains. This is very similar to an
injunction prescribed by the Buddhistic teachers also. But

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

this fact furnishes, I think, no safe ground for a chronological
inference, more especially because, as pointed out by Dr. Bühler, the
Buddhistic injunction is itself only borrowed from the Brahmanical rules
on the subject <span id="fr_1008"></span>[1](#fn_1003.md). It is
impossible, therefore, to say that the Anugîtâ borrowed its doctrine
from Buddhism. It is, of course, equally impossible on the other hand to
say, that Buddhism borrowed its rule from the Anugîtâ. And, therefore,
we can build no safe inference upon this fact either. We have next the
very remarkable passage at chapter XXXIV, where various contradictory
and mutually exclusive views of piety are stated, or rather passingly
and briefly indicated--a passage which one most devoutly wishes had been
clearer than it is. In that passage I can find no reference to Buddhism.
True it is that Nîlaka*nth*a's commentary refers some of the doctrines
there stated to Buddhistic schools <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[2](#fn_1004.md). But that commentary, unsatisfactory
enough in other places, is particularly unsatisfactory here. And its
critical accuracy may be judged from its reference to Saugatas and
Yogâ*k*âras apparently as two distinct schools, whereas in truth the
Saugatas are Buddhists, and Yogâ*k*âras one of the four principal
Buddhist sects. And it must be further remembered, that the
interpretations of Nîlaka*nth*a, upon which his specifications of the
different schools are based, are by no means such as necessarily claim
acceptance. If then we d o not find any reference to Buddhism in this
passage, that fact becomes certainly a remarkable one. Still, on the
other hand, I am not prepared to apply the 'negative argument' here, and
to say that inasmuch as Buddhism is not referred to where so many
different opinions are referred to, Buddhism cannot have come into
existence at the date of the Anugîtâ. It seems to me that the argument
will here be a very hazardous one, because if the author of the Anugîtâ
was, as we may assume he was, an orthodox Hindu, he might well have
declined, although not unacquainted with Buddhism, to put into the
mouths of the-seven sages even as a possible view, that

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

which was the view of a school esteemed heretical by the author and his
co-religionists. This passage, therefore, also fails to furnish any
tangible ground for a chronological inference, at all events in the
present state of our knowledge. Lastly, we come to the allusion to those
who indulge in constant talk in disparagement of Vedas and Brâhma*n*as,
the two being thus bracketed together in the original. That seems, at
the first blush, to be a somewhat more distinct allusion to Buddhism
than any of those we have noted above. But even that is not unambiguous.
If the stanzas quoted by Mâdhavâ*k*ârya, in his
Sarvadar*s*anasa<u>n</u>graha in its first section, are the composition
of the original founder of the *K*ârvâka school, or even if they
correctly represent the earliest opinions of that school, it is at least
quite as likely that the *K*ârvâkas were the target for the
denunciations of the Anugîtâ in the passage in question as that the
Buddhists were so. To me, indeed, it appears to be more likely. For
Buddha's opinion with regard to the Vedas is, that they are inadequate;
with regard to the Brâhma*n*as, that they are in no sense the chosen of
God as they claim to be. The opinion of the *K*ârvâkas, on the other
hand, is a far, more aggressive one, so to say. According to
Mâdhavâ*k*ârya, they taught that the Vedas were either simple fatuity or
imposture, and that the Brâhma*n*as were impostors. It seems to me much
more likely, that this, which I have called a comparatively aggressive
attitude, was the one at which the remarks of the Anugîtâ were levelled;
and more especially does this appear to be correct when we remember,
that the view taught by Gautama Buddha regarding the Vedas and the
Brâhma*n*as was propounded by him only in its strongest form; and that
even before his time, the doctrine of the inadequacy of the Vedas for
the purpose of securing the summum bonum of humanity had been taught by
other teachers. It is further to be recollected, that we have evidence
showing that other thinkers also than Buddha, or B*ri*haspati, had in
early days attacked the authority of the Vedas. Kautsa is the name of
one who was probably the most distinguished among them. It is certainly
possible that his followers

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

were the people branded as of 'the dark quality' by the Anugîtâ in the
passage in question. We have, therefore, at least two different
recognised bodies of thinkers, and one individual thinker, to whom the
words under discussion may apply, and it is plainly unsafe, under these
circumstances, to draw any chronological inference based on the
hypothesis of one particular body out of those three being the one
intended by the author. Before closing this part of the investigation,
it may be interesting to note, that the phrase 'turning the wheel,' a
phrase now so familiar to us as one of the household words of Buddhism,
is used in the Anugîtâ with respect to King *G*anaka. I do not think,
however, that either alone, or even coupled with the word Nirvâna, that
phrase can be made the basis of any legitimate deduction in favour of
the priority of the Anugîtâ, to Buddhism. At the outside, the only
deduction admissible, if any deduction were admissible, would be, that
the Anugîtâ was composed prior to the recognition, of Nirvâ*n*a and
*K*akrapravartana as specially Buddhistic words. But priority to such
recognition is not, I apprehend, necessarily synonymous with priority to
the rise of Buddhism.

The net result of this part of the investigation appears to be, that we
have pretty strong grounds for holding the Anugîtâ to belong to a period
very considerably removed from the period of the Upanishads and the
Bhagavadgîtâ; but that we have no tangible grounds on which to base any
deduction regarding its priority or otherwise to the Sâ<u>n</u>khya, and
Yoga systems of philosophy, or to the great movement of Gautama Buddha.
There is only one other point, which we can establish in a not entirely
unsatisfactory way, and which enables us to draw closer the limits
within which the Anugîtâ must have been composed. That point is the
position of the Anugîtâ with reference to Âpastamba's Dharma-sûtra. I
need not say again, that I accept here the proposition about the age of
Âpastamba which has been laid down by Dr. Bühler, as a sufficiently
satisfactory working hypothesis. And accepting that proposition, I
venture to suggest the fourth century B.C. as a not unlikely date for
the Anugîtâ. It appears to me, that a comparison of

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

the Anugîtâ and the rules of Âpastamba upon one important point which
they both deal with shows the priority of the former work. I allude to
the rules and regulations touching the four Â*s*ramas or orders
contained in the Anugîtâ and in the Dharma-sûtra of Âpastamba. One
circumstance strikes us at once on I comparing the two works on this
point. Âpastamba goes into a very great deal of minute details more than
the Anugîtâ, although the latter work does not deal with the topic in
any very summary mode. Taking all the differences between the two works
together, and the fact that the Anugîtâ sets about the discussion of the
topic in a manner which seems intended to be--not, indeed, absolutely
exhaustive, but still--very full, I am very strongly inclined to
attribute the differences. to an actual development and progress of
doctrine. I will endeavour to illustrate this view by means of a few
detailed instances <span id="fr_1010"></span>[1](#fn_1005.md). And let us
first take the order of householders to which the Anugîtâ gives
precedence over the others. One of the injunctions laid down by the
Anugîtâ is that the householder should always be devoted to his wife.
Against this simple precept, we have a very minute series of rules
prescribed by Âpastamba, which it is not necessary to refer to
specifically, but which may be seen in several of the Sûtras contained
in the first Kha*nd*a of the first Pa*t*ala of the Second Pra*s*na.
Compare again the excessive minuteness of the rules regarding the
Bali-offering or the reception of guests, as given by Âpastamba, with
the simple statement of the Anugîtâ that the five great sacrifices
should be performed. There again, I think, we are to see in this
difference of treatment the result of a pretty long course of ceremonial
progress. Proceeding to the rules regarding the Brahma*k*ârin or
student, an analogous phenomenon meets us there. Taking first the
subject of food, we have a considerable number of detailed injunctions
in Âpastamba, compared with the simple rule of the Anugîtâ, that the
student should, with the leave of his preceptor, eat his food without
decrying it. Again with regard to alms, whereas the Anugîtâ simply

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

says that the student should take his food out of the alms received by
him, Âpastamba has an elaborate catena of rules as to how the alms are
to be collected, and from whom, and so forth. Take again the provisions
in the two works regarding the description of the cloth, staff, and
girdle of the student. Âpastamba refers to various opinions on this
subject, of which there is not even a trace in the Anugîtâ <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[1](#fn_1006.md). It appears that even before
Âpastamba's time, distinctions had been laid down as to the description
of girdle staff and cloth to be used by the different
castes--distinctions of which there is no hint in the Anugîtâ, where all
students, of whatever caste, are spoken of under the generic name. These
distinctions appear to me to point very strongly to that ceremonial and
doctrinal progress of which we have spoken above. The tendency is
visible in them to sever the Brâhma*n*as from the other castes--by
external marks. And that tendency, it seems to me, must have set in, as
the merits which had given the Brâhma*n*a caste its original position at
the head of Hindu society were ceasing to be a living reality, and that
caste was intrenching itself, so to say, more behind the worth and work
of the early founders of its greatness, than the worth and work of their
degenerating representatives. These comparisons, taken together, appear
to me to warrant the proposition we have already laid down with regard
to the priority of the Anugîtâ to Âpastamba. If we have not referred to
the rules relating to the two other orders of forester and ascetic, it
is because the scope for a comparison of those is very limited. Those
rules alone would scarcely authorise the inference drawn above; but I
can perceive nothing in them to countervail the effect of the
comparisons already made. And it must be remembered, that the rules as
to foresters and ascetics would be less apt to undergo change than chose
as to students and householders.

It appears to me that the view we have now expressed may be also
supported by a comparison of the doctrines of the Anugîtâ and Âpastamba
touching the duties of Brâhma*n*as. According to Âpastamba, the
occupations lawful

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

to Brâhma*n*as are the famous six referred to in our Introduction to the
Bhagavadgîtâ, and two others superadded, namely, inheritance and
gleaning corn in the fields. These last are not mentioned in the
Anugîtâ, or in Manu either, and are, even according to Âpastamba, common
to Brâhma*n*as with Kshatriyas and Vai*s*yas. But as regards the six
above referred to, it is worthy of note, that the Anugîtâ apparently
groups them into two distinct sets of three. The first set of three
consists of those which, in our Introduction to the Bhagavadgîtâ, we
have characterised as constituting rather the rights than the duties of
Brâhma*n*as, and which the Anugîtâ describes as 'means of livelihood for
Brâhmanas.' The other set of three consists of real duties, and these
the Anugîtâ speaks of as 'pious duties.' This grouping appears to me to
furnish powerful corroboration of the view put forward in our
introduction to the Bhagavadgîtâ. It would seem, that the possession of
the moral and spiritual merits which, according to the Gîtâ, constituted
the duty of Brâhma*n*as, in the simple and archaic society there
disclosed, was developed, in a more advanced and artificial state of
society, into the performance of the 'pious duties' of the Anugîtâ and
the duties which are 'the means of livelihood.' Then in the further
social evolution, in the course of which the old spiritual view began to
be forgotten, and the actual facts of the past began to be transmuted
into the dogmatic rules of the future, the occupations of receiving
presents, imparting instruction, and officiating at sacrifices, became
the special occupations of the Brâhma*n*as, and the distinction between
these occupations from their higher duties was thrown into the
background; and accordingly we find no allusion to any such distinction
in Âpastamba or Manu, or, as far as I know, in any other later
embodiment of the current ideas on the subject <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[1](#fn_1007.md). If all this has been correctly
argued, the conclusion derivable from it is in entire accord with that
which we have already drawn, namely, that the Bhagavadgîtâ, the Anugîtâ,
and the Dharma-sûtra of Âpastamba, belong to different

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

stages of ancient Indian history, and that the stage to which the Gîtâ
belongs is the earliest, and that to which Âpastamba belongs, the latest
of such stages.

I am unable to find anything else in the way of internal evidence
bearing upon the date of the Anugîtâ. It appears to me, that the date to
which the investigation we have now gone through leads us, is one which,
in the present state of our information, may be fairly accepted as a
provisional hypothesis. It does not appear to me to conflict with any
ascertained dates, while it is pointed to as probable by the various
lines of testimony which we have here considered. We now proceed to
discuss one or two other points which may have a bearing upon this
topic, but which at present cannot yield us any positive guidance in our
search for the date of the Anugîtâ. And first among these, let us
consider the various names of deities that occur in different parts of
the work. We have, then, Vish*n*u, *S*ambhu, Gish*n*u, Soma, Âditya,
Surya, Mitra, Agni, *K*andra, Rudra, *S*iva, Varu*n*a, Pra*g*âpati,
Maghavat, Purandara, Indra, Brahman, *S*atakratu, Dharma, Nârâya*n*a,
Vâyu, Yama, Tvash*tr*i, Hari, Î*s*vara, and lastly Umâ under three
different names, namely, Umâ, Mâhe*s*varî, and Pârvatî. Now, leaving
aside for the moment the three names of Umâ, which appear from the
passage where they are used to be all three the names of the same
goddess, there is no doubt that in the list above set out, some of the
names are merely used in different passages, but still to indicate the
same being. Thus, Indra, Satakratu, Purandara, and Maghavat are really
the names of one and the same deity. But when Soma is mentioned as the
deity presiding over the tongue, and *K*andramas as the deity presiding
over the mind, it becomes doubtful whether the two names do really
indicate the same deity, albeit in later Sanskrit Soma and *K*andramas
both signify the moon. Similarly, when Arka is said to be the deity
presiding over the eye, and Mitra over another organ, it seems open to
question whether Arka and Mitra both signify the sun there, as they
undoubtedly do in classical Sanskrit. True it is, that even in such a
recent work as the Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, this mention

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

of Arka and Mitra as presiding deities of two several organs does occur.
But it is plain, that that circumstance can have, no bearing on the
inquiry before its, for the Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra is avowedly a
compilation based on older authorities, and in the particular part under
consideration, really reproduces a passage from some older work. It
cannot, therefore, be argued, that because Arka and Mitra were
identified with one another at the time of the Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, and
yet are mentioned as deities of two separate organs, therefore, they
must have also been regarded as one in the older original work where
they are also mentioned as deities of two separate organs. And it may,
perhaps, be remarked here in passing, that the Vedânta Paribhâshâ has
M*ri*tyu instead of Mitra, which would get rid of the difficulty here
altogether; while as regards Soma and *K*andramas, the passage in the
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra reads Pra*k*etas instead of Soma, which would get
rid of the other difficulty above pointed out. Whether these
discrepancies are owing to any tampering with the lists of organs and
deities, at a time when the later identifications between different
deities took place, or whether they are to be explained on some other
theory, it is impossible at present to say. And, therefore, it is also
unnecessary to pursue the inquiry here any further. It must suffice for
the present to have drawn attention to the matter.

Akin to this point, though quite distinct from it, is one which arises
on a passage where the emancipated being is identified with Vish*n*u,
Mitra, Agni, Varuna, and Pra*g*âpati <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[1](#fn_1008.md). Now it is reasonable to suppose, that
the deities thus specified here must have been among those held in
highest repute at the time, the whole significance of the passage where
they are mentioned requiring that that should be so. But in our Pantheon
as disclosed by our later literature, Mitra and Agni and Varuna occupy
but a very subordinate position. Even in Kâlidâsa <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[2](#fn_1009.md), the subordination of these deities to
our celebrated Trinity seems to be quite

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

fully established. But, on the other hand, in the Vedic theogony they
are among the most prominent deities. In the Taittirîya-upanishad, we
have in the very first sentence Mitra, Varu*n*a, Vish*n*u, and Brahman
(who may be identified with Pra*g*âpati) all mentioned together, and
their blessings invoked. This does not help in fixing a date for the
Anugîtâ; but it lends some support to the conclusion already arrived at
on that point, by showing that the theogony of the Anugîtâ is not yet
very far removed from the theogony of the Vedic times, while it is
separated by a considerable interval from the theogony disclosed in the
works of even such an early writer of the classical period' as Kâlidâsa.

Another point of similar bearing on our present investigation is the
mode in which the story of Para*s*urâma is dealt with in the Anugîtâ.
There is in the first place no allusion to his being an incarnation of
Vish*n*u, nor to the encounter between him and his namesake, the son of
Da*s*aratha and the hero of the Râmâya*n*a. We have, on the contrary, an
explicit statement, that after the advice of the 'Pit*ri*s' he entirely
abandons the slaughter of the Kshatriyas, and resorting to penance
thereby achieves final emancipation. We have elsewhere argued <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[1](#fn_1010.md), that the theory of Para*s*urâma being
an incarnation of Vish*n*u, must have probably originated prior to the
time of Bhart*ri*hari, but later than the time of Kâlidâsa. The allusion
to Parasurâma in the work before us does not, however, enable us to
judge of its chronological position with reference to Kâlidâsa. But the
last point discussed renders it unnecessary to consider this question
further. It may be noted, by the way, that the Anugîtâ represents
Para*s*urâma, although living in the Â*s*rama or hermitage of his
father, who was a *Ri*shi, as mounting a chariot for the purpose of
sweeping away the kinsmen of Kârtavîrya. Whence he obtained a chariot in
a hermitage, the Anugîtâ does not explain.

In connexion with the episode of Parasurâma, may be noted the list which
occurs in the course of it, of the

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

degraded Kshatriya tribes, of Dravi*d*as, Sabaras, &c. I am unable to
see that those names can give us any further help in our present
investigation than in so far as they show that, at the time of the
Anugîtâ, there must have been some information about the south of India
available in the districts where the author of the Anugîtâ lived. Some
of the tribes mentioned appear to have been located far in the south of
the Indian peninsula. But this is a point on which we shall have to say
something more in discussing, the next item of internal evidence to
which we shall refer. Here it is enough to point out that some of the
tribes mentioned in the Anugîtâ are also referred to in no less a work
than the Aitareya-brâhma*n*a <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1](#fn_1011.md).

We come next to the enumeration of the principal mountains which is
contained in one passage of the Anugîtâ. Those mountains are the
Himâlaya, the Pâriyâtra, the Sahya, the Vindhya, the. Trikû*t*avat, the
*S*veta, the Nîla, the Bhâsa, the Kosh*th*avat, the Mahendra, the
Mâlyavat, and perhaps the Guruskandha. I am not sure whether the last
name is intended to be taken as a proper name, or only as an epithet of
Mahendra. Now compared with the mountains mentioned in the Bhagavadgîtâ,
this is certainly a remarkable list. The Gîtâ mentions only Meru <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[2](#fn_1012.md) and Himâlaya; while here we have in
the Anugîtâ the Sahya,. and Malaya, and Trikû*t*avat, and Nîla (the
same, I presume, with the modem Nîlgiri, the Sanatarium of the Madras
Presidency), which take us far to the west and south of the Indian
peninsula; and the Mahendra and Mâlyavat, which, coupled with the
mention of the river Ganges, cover a considerable part of the eastern
districts. The Pariyâtra and Vindhya occupy the regions of Central
India. The Anugîtâ, therefore, seems to belong to that period in the
history of India, when pretty nearly the whole,

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

if not absolutely the whole, of the Indian continent was known to the
Sanskrit-speaking population of the country. When was this knowledge
reached? It is difficult to fix the precise period; and even if it could
be fixed, it would not help us to fix satisfactorily any point of time
to which the Anugîtâ could be attributed. But it may be pointed out
here, that in Patañ*g*ali's Mahâbhâshya we have evidence of such
knowledge having been possessed by the Âryas in the second century B.C.
In truth, the evidence available in the Mahâbhâshya is even fuller than
this in the Anugîtâ. For Patañ*g*ali tells us of a town or city in the
south named Kâñ*ki*pura <span id="fr_1018"></span>[1](#fn_1013.md); he
speaks of the dominions of the Pâ*nd*ya kings, and of the Kola and
Kerala districts <span id="fr_1019"></span>[2](#fn_1014.md); he refers also
to the large tanks of the south; and he makes allusions to linguistic
usages current in the southern and other provinces <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[3](#fn_1015.md). Before Patañ*g*ali's time there had
taken place Mahendra's invasion of Ceylon, and the invading army must
have penetrated through the southern provinces. And there had been also
put up the great Inscriptions of Asoka, which have attracted so much
interest, and are proving such prolific sources of information in
various departments of knowledge. One of these inscriptions was at
Gañ*g*am, which is not very far from the Mahendra mountain alluded to in
the Anugîtâ <span id="fr_1021"></span>[4](#fn_1016.md). All these facts
support the conclusion drawn by General Cunningham from the correctness
of the information given to Alexander the Great by the Hindus of his
time, namely, that 'the Indians, even at that early date in their
history, had a very accurate knowledge of the form and extent of their
native land <span id="fr_1022"></span>[5](#fn_1017.md).' And not only do
they support that conclusion, they show that the knowledge covered other
facts regarding

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

their native land than its form and extent. It follows consequently that
this enumeration of mountains does not require the date of the Anugîtâ
to be brought down to a later period than the fourth century B.C., and
leaves it open to us, therefore, to accept whatever conclusion the other
evidence available may seem to justify. On the other hand, it is plain
also, that it affords no positive information as to when the Anugîtâ was
composed, and therefore we need not dwell any further upon the point on
the present occasion.

There are a few other points which arise upon the contents of the
Anugîtâ, but which are not, in the present condition of our knowledge,
capable of affording any certain guidance in our present investigation.
Thus we have the story of Dharma appearing before king *G*anaka
disguised as a Brâhma*n*a. I am not aware of any case of such disguises
occurring in any of the Upanishads, although there are numerous parallel
instances throughout the Purânik literature <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[1](#fn_1018.md). It is, however, difficult to draw any
definite chronological inference from this fact. There is further the
reference to the attack of Râhu on the sun. It is difficult, in the
present state of our knowledge, to say for certain, when the theory of
eclipses there implied was prevalent. In the *Kh*ândogya-upanishad <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[2](#fn_1019.md) we have the emancipated self compared
to the moon escaped from the mouth of Râhu. And a text of the Rig-veda,
quoted by Mr. Ya*g*ñesvara *S*âstrin in his Âryavidyâsudhâkara <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[3](#fn_1020.md), speaks of the demon Râhu attacking
the sun with darkness. Here again we have another matter of some
interest; but I cannot see that any safe deduction can be derived from
it, without a more ample knowledge of other relevant matters than is at
present accessible. Take again the references to certain practices which
look very much like the practices of the *G*ainas of the present day. Is
the Anugîtâ, then, earlier or later than the rise of the *G*aina system?
It is not safe, I think, to found an answer to this question upon the
very narrow basis afforded by the

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

passage referred to. But it may be observed, that the precepts laid down
in the passage in question are laid down as precepts for orthodox
Hindus, and not as the doctrines of a heretical sect. They are also very
general, and not so minute as those which the *G*ainas of the present
day observe as binding upon them. If, therefore, any conclusion is to be
drawn from these precepts, it must be that the Anugîtâ must have been
composed prior to the rise of *G*ainism; and that *G*ainism must have
appropriated and developed this doctrine which it obtained from the
current Brâhmanism <span id="fr_1026"></span>[1](#fn_1021.md). If this is
so, the Anugîtâ must be a very ancient work indeed. It is not, however,
necessary to further work out this line of argument, having regard to
the opinions recently expressed by Mr. Thomas <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[2](#fn_1022.md), rehabilitating the views enunciated
long ago by Colebrooke and others. If those views are correct, and if
*G*ainism was a dominant system in this country prior even to the time
of Gautama Buddha, and if, further, we are right in the suggestion--for
it is no more it must be remembered--that the Anugîtâ dates from a
period prior to the rise of *G*ainism, then it would seem to follow that
the Anugîtâ belongs to some period prior to the sixth century B.C. All
this, however, is at present very hypothetical, and we draw attention to
it only that the question may be hereafter considered when fuller
materials for adjudicating upon it become accessible. Meanwhile, having
regard to the views above alluded to as so elaborately put forward by
Mr. Thomas, it is possible for us still to hold that, in the present
state of our knowledge, the third or fourth century B.C. is not too
early a date to, assign to the Anugîtâ, even on the assumption that the
precepts contained in that work regarding the care to be taken of worms
and insects were borrowed by it from the *G*aina system. With this
negative result, we must for the present rest contented.

One other fact of similar nature to those we have now

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

dealt with may, perhaps, be also noticed here. We allude to the stanzas
which we find in the Anugîtâ and also in the Sânti Parvan of the
Mahâbhârata and in the Manusm*ri*ti. There is also one which the Anugîtâ
has in common with the Pari*s*ish*t*a of Yâska's Nirukta <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[1](#fn_1023.md). It is not possible, I conceive, to
say finally whether one of these works borrowed these stanzas from the
other of them; while, on the other hand, it is quite possible, as
already argued by us in the Introduction to the Gîtâ, that all these
works were only reproducing from some entirely different work, or that
the stanzas in question were the common property of the thinkers of the
time. We have no means available for deciding between these conflicting
hypotheses.

We have thus noticed all the salient points in the evidence, external
and internal, which is available for determining the position of the
Anugîtâ in our ancient literature. Nobody who has seen even a little of
the history of that literature will be surprised at the quantity or
quality of that evidence, or the nature of the conclusions legitimately
yielded by it. We have endeavoured to express those conclusions in
language which should not indicate any greater certainty as attaching to
them than can fairly be claimed for them. The net result appears to be
this. The Anugîtâ may be taken with historical certainty to have been
some centuries old in the time of the great Sankarâ*k*ârya. It was very
probably older than the Dharma-sûtras of Âpastamba, but by what period
of time we are not in a position at present to define. It was, perhaps,
older also than the rise of Buddhism and Gainism, and of the Yoga
philosophy; but on this it is impossible to say anything with any
approach to confidence. It is, on the other hand, almost certain that it
belongs to a period very considerably removed from the older
Upanishads.; probably removed by a distance of some centuries, during
which 'stories' not contained in the Upanishads had not only obtained
currency, but also come to be regarded as belonging to antiquity <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[2](#fn_1024.md). And yet the period to

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

which the work belongs was one in which the Upanishads were only
reverenced as the authoritative opinions of eminent men, not as the
words of God himself <span id="fr_1030"></span>[1](#fn_1025.md). In this
respect, it may be said that the Anugîtâ seems rather to belong to an
earlier stratum of thought than even the Sanatsu*g*âtîya, in which a
*G*ñânakâ*nd*a, as forming a part of the Vedic canon, seems to be
recognised <span id="fr_1031"></span>[2](#fn_1026.md). But it is abundantly
clear, that the Anugîtâ stands, at a very considerable chronological
distance from the Bhagavadgîtâ.

Such are the results of our investigation. We have not thought it
necessary to discuss the verse or the language of the work. But it must
in fairness be pointed out, that upon the whole, the verse and language
are both pretty near the classical model. There are, it is true, a few
instances of the metrical anomalies we have noticed elsewhere, but
having regard to the extent of the work, those instances are far from
being very numerous. The language and style, too, are not quite smooth
and polished; though, judging from them alone, I should rather be
inclined to place the Sanatsu*g*âtîya prior to the Anugîtâ. But that
suggests a question which we cannot now stop to discuss.

One word, in conclusion, about the translation. The text used has been
chiefly that adopted in the commentary of Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, a commentary
which on the whole I prefer very much to that of Nîlaka*nth*a, which has
been printed in the Bombay edition of the Mahâbhârata. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra,
as a rule, affords some explanation where explanation is wanted, and
does not endeavour to suit his text to any foregone conclusion. His
comments have been of the greatest possible help to me; and my only
regret is that the only copy of his commentary which was available to
me, and the use of which I owe to the kindness of my friend Professor
Bhâ*nd*ârkar, was not as correct a one as could be desired. I have also
looked into the Vishama*s*lokî, a short work containing notes on
difficult passages of the Mahâbhârata.

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The MS. of it belonging to the Government
Collection of MSS. deposited in Deccan College was lent me also by
Professor Bhâ*nd*ârkar. The principles adopted in the translation and
notes have been the same as those followed in the other pieces contained
in this volume.

P. S. I take this opportunity of stating that it is not at all certain
that Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra is the name of the author of the commentary which
I have used. I find that in supposing Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra to be the author,
I confounded that commentary, which does not mention its author's name,
with the commentary on another section of the Mahâbhârata which does
give its author's name as Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, and which is also among the
MSS. purchased by Professor Bhâ*nd*ârkar for the Government of Bombay.
(See with regard to these MSS. Professor Bhâ*nd*ârkar's recently
published Report on the search for Sanskrit MSS. Of 7th July, 1880.)

<span id="fn_978"></span>[201:1](sbe0827.htm#fr_983.md) In the beginning of
his gloss on the Anugîtâ he says, that it proposes to explain difficult
passages in the Anugîtâ, &c.--Anugâtâdishu. And at the outset of his
gloss on the whole Parvan he says, that in the Anugîtâ we have a
statement of the miseries of birth, &c. as a protest against worldly
life; in the Brahma Gîtâ we have a recommendation of Prâ*n*âyâma, &c.;
and in the Guru*s*ishyasa*m*vâda we have a eulogium on the perception of
the self as distinct from Prak*ri*ti or nature, and incidentally a
protest against Prav*ri*tti or action.
