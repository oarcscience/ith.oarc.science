# CHAPTER XI.

There is one director <span id="fr_1351"></span>[1](#fn_1346.md); there is
no second director. I speak concerning him who abides in the heart. This
being, the director, dwells in the heart and directs (all creatures).
Impelled by that same (being), I move as I am ordered, like water on a
declivity. There is one instructor; there is no second (different) from
him. I speak concerning him who abides in the heart. Taught by that
instructor, all snakes whatever are ever hated in the world <span
id="fr_1352"></span>[2](#fn_1347.md). There is one kinsman; there is no
second (different) from him. I speak concerning him who abides in the
heart. Taught by him kinsmen are possessed of kinsmen <span
id="fr_1353"></span>[3](#fn_1348), (and.md) the seven *Ri*shis, O son of
P*ri*thâ <span id="fr_1354"></span>[4](#fn_1349.md)! shine in heaven <span
id="fr_1355"></span>[5](#fn_1350.md). There

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

is one hearer <span id="fr_1356"></span>[1](#fn_1351.md); there is no
second (different) from him. I speak concerning him who abides in the
heart. Living under that instructor, (according to the proper mode of)
living with an instructor, *S*akra <span
id="fr_1357"></span>[2](#fn_1352.md) acquired immortality in all worlds.
There is one enemy; there is no second (different) from him. I speak
concerning him who abides in the heart. Taught by that instructor, all
snakes whatever are ever hated in the world <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[3](#fn_1353.md). On this, too, they relate an ancient
story, (about the) instruction of the snakes, and the gods, and sages,
by Pra*g*âpati. The gods, and sages, and the snakes, and the demons,
approaching Pra*g*âpati, said (to him): 'Tell us the highest good.' To
them who were inquiring about the highest good, the venerable one said,
'Om <span id="fr_1359"></span>[4](#fn_1354.md), the Brahman, in a single
syllable.' Hearing that, they ran away in (various) directions <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[5](#fn_1355.md). When they were running. for
instruction regarding the self, the inclination of the snakes to biting
had been already formed. The natural inclination of the demons towards
ostentatiousness had been formed. The gods had been engaged in gifts,
and the great sages in restraint of the senses. Having had one teacher,

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

and having been instructed with one word, the snakes, the gods, the
sages, and the demons, all engaged in different <span
id="fr_1361"></span>[1](#fn_1356) (pursuits.md). One hears what is said (to
one) and apprehends it duly; (but even) to one who inquires and extols
highly, there is no other instructor <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[2](#fn_1357.md). And by his counsel does action
afterwards take place. The instructor, the learner, the hearer, and the
enemy, are always within the heart. Acting sinfully in the world, he
becomes (a man of) sinful conduct. Acting virtuously in the world he
becomes .(a man of) virtuous conduct <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[3](#fn_1358.md). And he becomes a man of conduct
according to his own desire <span id="fr_1364"></span>[4](#fn_1359.md),
who, owing to his desires, is given up to the pleasures of the senses.
But he who, casting aside vows <span id="fr_1365"></span>[5](#fn_1360.md)
and actions, merely adheres to the Brahman, he moving about in the world
identifying himself with the Brahman, becomes a Brahma*k*ârin. To him
the Brahman itself is the fuel, the Brahman the fire, the Brahman his
origin, the Brahman water, the Brahman the instructor. He is rapt in the

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

Brahman <span id="fr_1366"></span>[1](sbe0839.htm#fn_1361.md). Such is this
subtle life as a Brahma*k*ârin understood by the wise. Understanding it
they practised it, being instructed by the Kshetra*g*ña <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[2](sbe0839.htm#fn_1362.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1346"></span>[281:1](sbe0838.htm#fr_1351.md) I. e. the Supreme
Being, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Nîlaka*nth*a connects this with the preceding
chapter by saying that this describes Nârâyana, who is there mentioned.
See *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), Chap. 226, st. 8 (Bombay ed.)

<span id="fn_1347"></span>[281:2](sbe0838.htm#fr_1352.md) The natural
feelings of animosity are caused by the Supreme Being within. Such seems
to be the meaning. Cf. Gîtâ, pp. [128](sbe0820.htm#page_128.md),
[129](sbe0820.htm#page_129.md). I may remark that Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra seems to
interpret the original words, which we have rendered by 'I speak
concerning him,' &c., to mean 'I repeat what has been said by,' &c. This
does not seem to me to be satisfactory; and it may be added, too, that
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's interpretation appears in his gloss not on the first
verse, about the 'director,' but only on the second, about the
instructor.' Hated = full of animosity, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1348"></span>[281:3](sbe0838.htm#fr_1353.md) I. e. the feeling
of kinsmanship arises from his inspiration.

<span id="fn_1349"></span>[281:4](sbe0838.htm#fr_1354.md) The poet seems to
be nodding here, as this expression cannot form part of the Brâhma*n*a's
speech to his wife.

<span id="fn_1350"></span>[281:5](sbe0838.htm#fr_1355.md) The seven sages
are always mentioned together, and may well be spoken of as types of the
feeling of kinship.

<span id="fn_1351"></span>[282:1](sbe0838.htm#fr_1356.md) Nîlaka*nth*a
takes this to mean pupil, but it is difficult to reconcile that with the
rest of the passage. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra renders it by 'the destroyer of
every one's doubts.' For that, it will be necessary to take the word as
a form of the causative, and not the simple root *s*ru, to hear. But
see, too, [p. 283](#page_283.md), 'the instructor . . . the hearer.'

<span id="fn_1352"></span>[282:2](sbe0838.htm#fr_1357.md) Cf.
Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p. 152](sbe0823.htm#page_152.md), note
 [1](sbe0823.htm#fn_618.md).

<span id="fn_1353"></span>[282:3](sbe0838.htm#fr_1358.md) The words here
are nearly the same as before; the commentators give no explanation of
the repetition. But see [p. 281](sbe0837.htm#page_281.md), note
 [2](#fn_1347.md).

<span id="fn_1354"></span>[282:4](sbe0838.htm#fr_1359.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
79](sbe0810.htm#page_79.md). The full sense is that from the study of this
Om the highest good is attained.

<span id="fn_1355"></span>[282:5](sbe0838.htm#fr_1360.md) I. e. to their
own dwellings, believing that they had learnt what they wanted.

<span id="fn_1356"></span>[283:1](sbe0838.htm#fr_1361.md) The meaning seems
to be that the original inclination was not altered by the new
instruction received by them. Nîlaka*nth*a seems to understand the
passage differently. What has been rendered in the text by 'when they
were running for instruction,' he renders by 'when they were practically
carrying out the instruction received by them;' but this rendering seems
to omit all consideration of the words 'Pûrvameva tu'--already. Though,
therefore, there are one or two circumstances in favour of this
construction, I have adopted the other. Cf. B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 964.

<span id="fn_1357"></span>[283:2](sbe0838.htm#fr_1362.md) The meaning is
that the real instructor is within oneself, 'abiding in the heart,' as
said before, although instruction may in form be received from one
outside, of whom one seeks to learn, and whom one respects (or extols
highly, as the text has it), and although such instruction may be well
apprehended.

<span id="fn_1358"></span>[283:3](sbe0838.htm#fr_1363.md) Cf.
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, pp. 546-853.

<span id="fn_1359"></span>[283:4](sbe0838.htm#fr_1364.md) See Gîtâ, [p.
117](sbe0818.htm#page_117.md).

<span id="fn_1360"></span>[283:5](sbe0838.htm#fr_1365.md) I. e. fasts and
other like observances.
