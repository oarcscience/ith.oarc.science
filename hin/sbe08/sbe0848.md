# CHAPTER XXI.

Brahman said:

That unperceived (principle), all-pervading, everlasting, and immutable,
which is in a state of equilibrium <span
id="fr_1528"></span>[8](#fn_1523), should be understood (to become.md) the
city of nine portals, consisting of three qualities, and five

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

constituent principles <span id="fr_1529"></span>[1](#fn_1524.md),
encircled by the, eleven <span id="fr_1530"></span>[2](#fn_1525.md),
consisting of mind <span id="fr_1531"></span>[3](#fn_1526.md) as the
distinguishing power, and of the understanding as ruler, this is (an
aggregate made up of) eleven <span id="fr_1532"></span>[4](#fn_1527.md).
The three currents <span id="fr_1533"></span>[5](#fn_1528.md) which are
within this (city) support (it) <span id="fr_1534"></span>[6](#fn_1529.md)
again and again, and those three channels run on, being constituted by
the three qualities. Darkness, passion, and goodness, these are called
the three qualities, which are all coupled with one another, and
likewise serve one another, which depend on one another, and attend on
one another, and are joined to one another <span
id="fr_1535"></span>[7](#fn_1530.md). And the five constituent principles

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

(are made up of) the three qualities. Goodness is the match of darkness,
and passion is the match of goodness; and goodness is also the match of
passion, and darkness the match of goodness. Where darkness is
restrained, passion there prevails. Where passion is restrained,
goodness there prevails <span id="fr_1536"></span>[1](#fn_1531.md).
Darkness should be understood to consist in obscurity. It has three
qualities <span id="fr_1537"></span>[2](#fn_1532.md), and is called
delusion. Its characteristic is also impiety, and it is constant in
sinful actions. This is the nature of darkness; it also appears combined
(with others). Passion is said to consist in activity, and is the cause
of successive <span id="fr_1538"></span>[3](#fn_1533) (acts.md). When it
prevails, its characteristic, among all beings, appears to be
production <span id="fr_1539"></span>[4](#fn_1534.md). Light,
lightness <span id="fr_1540"></span>[5](#fn_1535.md), faith, such is stated
to be the nature of goodness (prevailing) among all beings, as accepted
by good men. The true nature of their characteristics, in aggregation
and separation, will now be stated together with the reasons; learn
those accurately. Delusion, ignorance,

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

want of liberality, indecision about actions <span
id="fr_1541"></span>[1](#fn_1536.md), sleep, haughtiness <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[2](#fn_1537.md), fear, avarice, grief, finding fault
with good acts, want of memory <span id="fr_1543"></span>[3](#fn_1538.md),
immaturity (of intellect), nihilism <span
id="fr_1544"></span>[4](#fn_1539), violation of (the rules of.md) conduct,
want of discrimination <span id="fr_1545"></span>[3](#fn_1538.md),
blindness, behaviour of the lowest <span
id="fr_1546"></span>[5](#fn_1540.md) quality, pride of performance without
(actual) performance, pride of knowledge without (actual) knowledge,
unfriendliness, evil disposition, want of faith, deluded convictions,
want of straightforwardness, want of knowledge <span
id="fr_1547"></span>[6](#fn_1541.md), sinful action, want of knowledge (of
the subtle principle), stolidity <span
id="fr_1548"></span>[7](#fn_1542.md), lassitude, want of self-restraint,
going into inferior ways; all these qualities, O Brâhma*n*as! are
celebrated as being dark. And whatever other states of mind, connected
with delusion, are found in various places in this world, all these are
dark qualities. Constant talk in disparagement of gods Brâhma*n*as and
Vedas, want of liberality, vanity, delusion <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[8](#fn_1543.md), anger, want of forgiveness likewise,
and also animosity

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

towards people, this is considered to be dark conduct. Whatever
vain <span id="fr_1550"></span>[1](#fn_1544) actions (there are.md), and
whatever vain gifts, and vain eating, that is considered to be dark
conduct. Reviling, and want of forgiveness, animosity, vanity, want of
faith also, this is considered to be dark conduct. And whatever such
people there are in this world, doers of sinful acts. who break through
(all) regulations, they are all held to be dark. I will state the wombs
appointed for these (men) of sinful actions. They go to the hell,
(namely) the brute (species), to be born in the lower hell <span
id="fr_1551"></span>[2](#fn_1545); (or become.md) the immovable
entities <span id="fr_1552"></span>[3](#fn_1546.md), animals, beasts of
burden, demons, and serpents, and worms, insects, birds, and also
creatures born from eggs, and all quadrupeds, and idiots, deaf and dumb
men, and whatever others are attacked by diseases generated by sin <span
id="fr_1553"></span>[4](#fn_1547.md). These dark, evil-conducted men, who
are sunk in darkness, who bear the marks of their own actions, the
current of whose (thoughts) is downwards <span
id="fr_1554"></span>[5](#fn_1548.md), sink into darkness. I will now
proceed to state their improvement and ascent; how, becoming men of
meritorious actions, they attain to the worlds of those who perform good
acts <span id="fr_1555"></span>[6](#fn_1549.md). Resorting to a
contrary <span id="fr_1556"></span>[7](#fn_1550) (course of life.md), and
growing old in (good) actions <span id="fr_1557"></span>[8](#fn_1551.md),
they exert

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

themselves, and through the ceremonies (performed for them) by
benevolent Brâhma*n*as devoted to their own duties, they go upwards to
the same world (as the Brâhma*n*as)--the heaven of the gods. Such is the
Vedic text. Resorting to a contrary <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[1](#fn_1552) (course of life.md), and growing old in
their own duties, they become men in this world whose nature is to
return <span id="fr_1559"></span>[2](#fn_1553.md). Coming to a sinful womb,
as *K*ândâlas <span id="fr_1560"></span>[3](#fn_1554.md), or deaf, or
lisping men, they attain to higher and higher castes in order; going
beyond the *S*ûdra womb, and (beyond) whatever other dark qualities
there are which abide in the quality of darkness <span
id="fr_1561"></span>[4](#fn_1555) in the current (of this world.md).
Attachment to objects of desire is laid down to be the great delusion.
There, sages and saints and gods become deluded, wishing for pleasure.
Darkness <span id="fr_1562"></span>[5](#fn_1556.md), delusion, the great
delusion, the great obscurity called anger, and death the blinding
obscurity; anger is called the great obscurity. I have now duly
described to you, O Brâhma*n*as! this quality of darkness, in full and
accurately with reference to

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

its nature, and also its qualities, and also. its source. Who, indeed,
understands this properly; who, indeed, perceives this properly? The
definition of the essence of darkness is, that one sees the real in what
is unreal. The qualities of darkness have been described to you in many
ways. And darkness in its higher and lower <span
id="fr_1563"></span>[1](sbe0849.htm#fn_1557) (forms.md) has been accurately
stated. The man who always understands these qualities gets rid of all
dark qualities.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1516"></span>[317:1](sbe0847.htm#fr_1521.md) Namely, how they
are all manifestations of the Brahman, and are all dissolved in it. Cf.
inter alia Gîtâ, pp. [74](sbe0809.htm#page_74.md),
[92](sbe0813.htm#page_92.md).

<span id="fn_1517"></span>[317:2](sbe0847.htm#fr_1522.md) See the
Kathopanishad, p. 149. Sec also [p. 332](sbe0852.htm#page_332.md) infra.

<span id="fn_1518"></span>[317:3](sbe0847.htm#fr_1523.md) See [p.
313](sbe0847.htm#page_313), note  [3](sbe0847.htm#fn_1497.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1519"></span>[317:4](sbe0847.htm#fr_1524.md) I. e. the mind.
Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 102](sbe0814.htm#page_102.md).

<span id="fn_1520"></span>[317:5](sbe0847.htm#fr_1525.md) Viz. smell,
sound, &c.

<span id="fn_1521"></span>[317:6](sbe0847.htm#fr_1526.md) Tranquillity,
self-restraint, &c., Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Are they not rather the three
qualities? As to 'twenty-four plus one' above, see [p.
368](sbe0858.htm#page_368.md).

<span id="fn_1522"></span>[317:7](sbe0847.htm#fr_1527.md) Does this mean
the senses, as at Gîtâ, [p. 123](sbe0820.htm#page_123.md)? An accurate
understanding of the things noted requires a knowledge of their relation
to the supreme, which is the means of final emancipation. And see [p.
337](sbe0854.htm#page_337.md) infra.

<span id="fn_1523"></span>[317:8](sbe0848.htm#fr_1528.md) See Gîtâ, [p.
107](sbe0816.htm#page_107.md), and Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, p. 11, and note
 [2](sbe0851.htm#fn_1610), [p. 331](sbe0851.htm#page_331.md) infra.

<span id="fn_1524"></span>[318:1](sbe0848.htm#fr_1529.md) The five gross
elements of which the body is composed (cf. Mahâbhârata, *S*ânti Parvan,
Moksha Dharma, chap. 183, st. 1 seq.) are developments of the
unperceived principle, the Prakriti. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
112](sbe0817.htm#page_112), where the words 'which remain (absorbed.md) in
nature' have been inadvertently omitted after 'with the mind as the
sixth.' As to the nine portals cf. Gîtâ, [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65.md).

<span id="fn_1525"></span>[318:2](sbe0848.htm#fr_1530.md) The five active
organs, the five perceptive senses, and the mind.

<span id="fn_1526"></span>[318:3](sbe0848.htm#fr_1531.md) This Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra takes to mean 'egoism.' Nîlaka*nth*a takes the usual meaning,
and adds, objects are produced from mental operations; 'distinguishing,'
that is, manifesting as distinct entities.

<span id="fn_1527"></span>[318:4](sbe0848.htm#fr_1532.md) The eleven are,
according to Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, the three qualities, the five gross
elements, the group of organs and senses as one, egoism, and
understanding.

<span id="fn_1528"></span>[318:5](sbe0848.htm#fr_1533.md) Viz. the nâ*d*îs,
I*d*â, Pi<u>n</u>galâ, and Sushum*n*â, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, who adds that
they are respectively of the quality of darkness, passion, and goodness.

<span id="fn_1529"></span>[318:6](sbe0848.htm#fr_1534.md) The three
nâ*d*îs, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, support the life-winds. Nîlaka*nth*a
takes the three currents to be the threefold inclination of the mind,
viz. towards a pure piety, towards injuring other living creatures, and
towards that mixed piety which requires the destruction of life for its
performance. Nîlaka*nth*a also has a different reading from Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra, which means 'are replenished' instead of 'support.' And the
three channels are, according to Nîlaka*nth*a, the Sa*m*skâras, or
effects of previous actions of piety or impiety.

<span id="fn_1530"></span>[318:7](sbe0848.htm#fr_1535.md) Coupled = always
existing in association with one another; serving = being necessary to
the operations of one another; depending = supporting one another like
three staves, says Nîlaka*nth*a; <span id="page_319">p. 319</span>
upholding, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, as the total absence of one would lead
to the absence of the others also; attending = becoming subordinate to
whichever of them is dominant for the time being; joined = so as to
become one organic whole Cf. as to all this, Yoga-sûtra II, 18, and
commentary, p. 101; Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ, Kârikâ 12, With Vâ*k*aspati
Mi*s*ra's comments on it.

<span id="fn_1531"></span>[319:1](sbe0848.htm#fr_1536.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
108](sbe0816.htm#page_108.md), and the quotation in the
Sâ<u>n</u>khyatattvakaumudî, p. 64.

<span id="fn_1532"></span>[319:2](sbe0848.htm#fr_1537.md) I. e.
characteristics, viz. obscurity (which seems to stand for ignorance),
delusion (which is false knowledge), and impiety (doing that which is
known to be sinful and wrong).

<span id="fn_1533"></span>[319:3](sbe0848.htm#fr_1538.md) The original
means, according to Nîlaka*nth*a, wrong, unlawful conduct. As to all
this cf. *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha), chap. 194, St. 29.

<span id="fn_1534"></span>[319:4](sbe0848.htm#fr_1539.md) I. e. apparently
perpetually doing something. Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 108](sbe0816.htm#page_108.md).

<span id="fn_1535"></span>[319:5](sbe0848.htm#fr_1540.md) Cf. as to this,
and generally also, Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ 13, and commentary of
Vâ*k*aspati Mi*s*ra (p. 64). The blazing upward., of fire is said to
illustrate the lightness of the quality of goodness which belongs to
fire.

<span id="fn_1536"></span>[320:1](sbe0848.htm#fr_1541.md) According to
Gîtâ, [p. 108](sbe0816.htm#page_108.md), doing nothing--stolid laziness--is
a mark of darkness. Cf. generally on this passage Gîtâ, pp.
[107](sbe0816.htm#page_107), [118](sbe0819.htm#page_118.md),
[124](sbe0820.htm#page_124.md) seq.; Maitrî, p. 49.

<span id="fn_1537"></span>[320:2](sbe0848.htm#fr_1542.md) The same word as
at Gîtâ, pp. [116](sbe0818.htm#page_116), [125](sbe0820.htm#page_125.md)
(headstrong in the latter passage should have been haughty). Cf. as to
the word, *Kh*ândogya, p. 383.

<span id="fn_1538"></span>[320:3](sbe0848.htm#fr_1545.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
51](sbe0804.htm#page_51.md).

<span id="fn_1539"></span>[320:4](sbe0848.htm#fr_1544.md) The opposite of
the belief mentioned at Gîtâ, [p. 126](sbe0820.htm#page_126.md).

<span id="fn_1540"></span>[320:5](sbe0848.htm#fr_1546.md) The same word as
at Gîtâ, [p. 109](sbe0816.htm#page_109.md). But the commentators render it
here by hi*m*sra, i. e. destructive.

<span id="fn_1541"></span>[320:6](sbe0848.htm#fr_1547.md) I am not sure
about the original word here, and the word next but one after this. The
latter Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra renders by sûkshmatattvâvedanam, which I have
translated above in the text. The former seems to mean general
unintelligence.

<span id="fn_1542"></span>[320:7](sbe0848.htm#fr_1548.md) Heaviness and
dulness, induced by indolence, &c., Nîlaka*nth*a. Lassitude is drooping
from despondency. Going into inferior ways, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra says, means
falling into the inferior castes; Nîlaka*nth*a says it means love for
base actions.

<span id="fn_1543"></span>[320:8](sbe0848.htm#fr_1549.md) Not being
cognisant of one's own shortcomings, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1544"></span>[321:1](sbe0848.htm#fr_1550.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
83](sbe0811.htm#page_83.md).

<span id="fn_1545"></span>[321:2](sbe0848.htm#fr_1551.md) Cf. Gîtâ [p.
116](sbe0818.htm#page_116.md).

<span id="fn_1546"></span>[321:3](sbe0848.htm#fr_1552.md) Such as trees and
so forth, which are also forms of life.

<span id="fn_1547"></span>[321:4](sbe0848.htm#fr_1553.md) This is alluded
to in some Smritis too. And cf. *Kh*ândogya, p. 158, and the quotation
in the commentary of Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sûtra V, 122.

<span id="fn_1548"></span>[321:5](sbe0848.htm#fr_1554.md) Such, says
Nîlaka*nth*a, as to fit them for the nether world See Tattvakaumudi,
p.113. As to marks, cf. [p. 239](sbe0829.htm#page_239.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1549"></span>[321:6](sbe0848.htm#fr_1555.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
130](sbe0820.htm#page_130.md).

<span id="fn_1550"></span>[321:7](sbe0848.htm#fr_1556.md) I. e. contrary to
that already described as dark.

<span id="fn_1551"></span>[321:8](sbe0848.htm#fr_1557.md) Nîlaka*nth*a
renders this to mean 'destroyed for Agnihotra. and such ceremonies,'
like the goat referred to above at [p. 290](sbe0840.htm#page_290.md).

<span id="fn_1552"></span>[322:1](sbe0848.htm#fr_1558.md) See note
 [7](#fn_1550.md) on last page. The sequence of ideas seems not to be
properly brought out here. In the course of transmigration after their
course of conduct is altered they become men, and then proceed to
heaven. This seems the real sense here.

<span id="fn_1553"></span>[322:2](sbe0848.htm#fr_1559.md) To return to life
and death, and so on, until they fit themselves for final emancipation.
Cf. Âpastamba II, 5, 11, 10-11.

<span id="fn_1554"></span>[322:3](sbe0848.htm#fr_1560.md) Cf. *Kh*ândogya,
p. 359.

<span id="fn_1555"></span>[322:4](sbe0848.htm#fr_1561.md) This is not very
clear, and the commentators give but little help. The meaning probably
is, that they gradually, in course of improvement, cross beyond the
Sûdra caste, and all those qualities or tempers of mind, and so forth,
which have been stated to appertain to the quality of darkness.

<span id="fn_1556"></span>[322:5](sbe0848.htm#fr_1562.md) Cf.
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ pp. 47, 48, and Vâ*k*aspati's comment. There these
are identified with the 'afflictions' of the Yoga-sâstra--ignorance,
self-consciousness, affection, aversion, persistent attachment, and they
are five divisions of false knowledge, or the quality of darkness, as it
is here called. See, too, *S*vetâ*s*vatara (comm.), p. 284.
