# CHAPTER II.

Vâsudeva <span id="fr_1072"></span>[2](#fn_1067) said

Then grasping his feet, Kâ*s*yapa, asked questions very difficult to
explain, and all of them that (being), the best of the supporters of
piety, did explain.

Kâ*s*yapa, said:

How does the body perish, and how, too, is it produced? How does one who
moves in this harassing course of worldly life become freed? And (how)
does the self, getting rid of nature, abandon the body (produced) from
it <span id="fr_1073"></span>[3](#fn_1068)? And how, being freed from
the body, does he attain to the other <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[4](#fn_1069)? How does this man enjoy the good and
evil acts done by himself? And where do the acts of one who is released
from the body remain?

The Brâhma*n*a said:

Thus addressed, O descendant of V*ri*sh*n*i! that Siddha answered these
questions in order. Hear me relate what (he said).

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

The Siddha said:

When those actions, productive of long life and fame <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1](#fn_1070), which a man performs here, are
entirely exhausted, after his assumption of another body, he performs
(actions of an) opposite character, his self being overcome at the
exhaustion of life <span id="fr_1076"></span>[2](#fn_1071). And his ruin
being impending, his understanding goes astray. Not knowing his own
constitution, <span id="fr_1077"></span>[3](#fn_1072), and strength, and
likewise the (proper) season, the man not being self-controlled, does
unseasonably what is injurious to himself When he attaches himself to
numerous very harassing (actions); eats too much <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[4](#fn_1073), or does not eat at all; when he takes
bad food, or meat <span id="fr_1079"></span>[5](#fn_1074), or drinks, or
(kinds of food) incompatible with one another, or heavy food in
immoderate quantities, or without (previously taken food) being properly
digested; or takes too much exercise, or is incontinent; or constantly,
through attachment to action, checks the regular course (of the
excretions <span id="fr_1080"></span>[6](#fn_1075)); or takes juicy
food <span id="fr_1081"></span>[7](#fn_1076); or sleeps by day <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[8](#fn_1077); or (takes food) not thoroughly
prepared; (such a man) himself aggravates the disorders

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

orders (in the body) when the time comes <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[1](#fn_1078). By aggravating the disorders (in) his
own (body), he contracts a disease which ends in death, or he even
engages in unreasonable (acts), such as hanging <span
id="fr_1084"></span>[2](#fn_1079) (oneself). From these causes, the
living <span id="fr_1085"></span>[3](#fn_1080) body of that creature
then perishes. Learn about that correctly as I am about to state it.
Heat being kindled in the body, and being urged by a sharp wind <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[4](#fn_1081), pervades the whole frame, and,
verily, checks the (movements of all the) life-winds. Know this truly,
that excessively powerful heat, if kindled in the body, bursts open the
vital parts-the seats of the Soul <span
id="fr_1087"></span>[5](#fn_1082). Then the soul, full of torments,
forthwith falls away from the perishable (body). Know, O best of the
twice-born! that (every) creature leaves the body, when the vital parts
are burst open, its self being overcome with torments. All beings are
constantly distracted with birth and death; and, O chief of the
twice-born! are seen abandoning (their) bodies; or entering the womb on
the exhaustion of (their previous) actions <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[6](#fn_1083). Again, a man suffers similar
torments, having his joints broken and suffering from

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

cold, in consequence of water <span id="fr_1089"></span>[1](#fn_1084).
As the compact association of the five elements is broken up, the wind
in the body, distributed within the five elements <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[2](#fn_1085), between the upward and downward
life-winds, being aggravated by cold, and urged by a sharp wind <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[3](#fn_1086), goes upwards <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[4](#fn_1087), abandoning the embodied (self) in
consequence of pain. Thus it <span id="fr_1093"></span>[5](#fn_1088)
leaves the body, which appears devoid of breath. Then devoid of warmth,
devoid of breath, devoid of beauty, and with consciousness destroyed,
the man, being abandoned by the Brahman <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[6](#fn_1089), is said to be dead. (Then) he ceases
to perceive (anything) with those very currents <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[7](#fn_1090) with which the supporter of the
body <span id="fr_1096"></span>[8](#fn_1091) perceives objects of sense.
In the same way, it is the eternal soul which preserves in the body the
life-winds which are produced from food <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[9](#fn_1092). Whatever (part of the body) is
employed in the collection <span id="fr_1098"></span>[10](#fn_1093) of
that, know

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

that to be a vital part, for thus it is seen (laid down) in the
Scriptures. Those vital parts being wounded, that (wind) directly comes
out therefrom, and entering the bosom of a creature obstructs the
heart <span id="fr_1099"></span>[1](#fn_1094). Then the possessor of
consciousness knows nothing <span id="fr_1100"></span>[2](#fn_1095).
Having his knowledge enveloped by darkness <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[3](#fn_1096), while the vitals are still enveloped,
the soul <span id="fr_1102"></span>[4](#fn_1097), being without a fixed
seat, is shaken about by the wind. And then he heaves a very deep and
alarming gasp, and makes the unconscious body quiver as he goes out (of
it). That soul, dropping out of the body, is surrounded on both sides by
his own actions <span id="fr_1103"></span>[5](#fn_1098), his own pure
and meritorious, as also his sinful (ones). Brâhma*n*as, possessed of
knowledge, whose convictions are correctly (formed) from sacred
learning, know him by (his) marks as one who has performed meritorious
actions or the reverse. As those who have eyes see a glow-worm disappear
here and there in darkness, so likewise do those who have eyes of
knowledge. Such a soul, the Siddhas see with a divine eye, departing
(from the body), or coming to the birth, or entering into a womb <span
id="fr_1104"></span>[6](#fn_1099). Its three descriptions <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[7](#fn_1100) of seats are here learnt from the
Scriptures. This world is the world of actions <span
id="fr_1106"></span>[8](#fn_1101), where

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

creatures dwell. All embodied (selfs), having here performed good or
evil (actions), obtain (the fruit). It is here they obtain higher or
lower enjoyments by their own actions. And it is those whose actions
here are evil, who by their actions go to, hell. Harassing is that lower
place where men are tormented. Freedom from it is very difficult, and
the self should be specially protected from it. Learn from me now the
seats in which creatures going up <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[1](#fn_1102) dwell, and which I shall describe
truly. Hearing this, you will learn the highest knowledge, and decision
regarding action <span id="fr_1108"></span>[2](#fn_1103). All (the
worlds in) the forms of stars, and this lunar sphere <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[3](#fn_1104), and also this solar sphere which
shines in the world by its own lustre, know these to be the seats of men
who perform meritorious actions. All these, verily, fall down again and
again in consequence of the exhaustion of their actions <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[4](#fn_1105) . And there, too, in heaven, there are
differences of low, high, and middling, <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[5](#fn_1106). Nor, even there, is there
satisfaction, (even) after a sight of most magnificent splendour. Thus
have I stated to you these seats distinctly. I will after this (proceed
to) state to you the production of the fœtus <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[6](#fn_1107). And, O twice-born one! hear that
attentively from me as I state it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1066"></span>[235:1](sbe0828.htm#fr_1071) This was
difficult, as the Siddha possessed extraordinary powers, such as that of
concealed movement, &c.

<span id="fn_1067"></span>[235:2](sbe0829.htm#fr_1072) Sic in MSS.

<span id="fn_1068"></span>[235:3](sbe0829.htm#fr_1073) Cf. as to getting
rid of nature, Gîtâ, pp.
[75](sbe0809.htm#page_75)-[106](sbe0815.htm#page_106). As to the body
produced from nature, cf. ibid. [p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112), and pp.
[317](sbe0847.htm#page_317)-[318](sbe0848.htm#page_318) infra.

<span id="fn_1069"></span>[235:4](sbe0829.htm#fr_1074) I. e. the
Brahman, says Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1070"></span>[236:1](sbe0829.htm#fr_1075) One reading omits
'fame,' as to which cf. Taittirîya-upanishad, p. 129; *Kh*ândogya, pp.
122-227. As to long life, cf. *Kh*ândogya, p. 272; exhausted, i.e. by
enjoyment of fruit in another world.

<span id="fn_1071"></span>[236:2](sbe0829.htm#fr_1076) Cf. *S*ârîraka
Bhâshya, p. 753 seq., where we have a slightly different view.

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[236:3](sbe0829.htm#fr_1077) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
renders the original, sattva, by svabhâva.

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[236:4](sbe0829.htm#fr_1078) Cf. for all this,
Gîtâ, pp. [62](sbe0806.htm#page_62), [69](sbe0808.htm#page_69),
[118](sbe0819.htm#page_118), which passages, however, are from a
slightly different point of view. See also Khândogya, p. 526.

<span id="fn_1074"></span>[236:5](sbe0829.htm#fr_1079) A various reading
here excludes meat. But cf. Âpastamba I, 1, 2, 23; Gautama II, 13.

<span id="fn_1075"></span>[236:6](sbe0829.htm#fr_1080) So says
Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1076"></span>[236:7](sbe0829.htm#fr_1081) I. e. which turns
to juice in digestion, much juice being a cause of indigestion, say the
commentators.

<span id="fn_1077"></span>[236:8](sbe0829.htm#fr_1082) This is doubtful.
The sense may be, 'who takes juicy or not thoroughly prepared food by
day and night.' But see Â*s*valâyana Grihya-sûtra, p. 90; Âpastamba I,
1, 2, 24; Gautama II, 13.

<span id="fn_1078"></span>[237:1](sbe0829.htm#fr_1083) The time of
destruction, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1079"></span>[237:2](sbe0829.htm#fr_1084) Which, say the
commentators, leads to death, even without any disease.

<span id="fn_1080"></span>[237:3](sbe0829.htm#fr_1085) So I construe the
original, having regard to the question, I how does the body perish?'
The other reading, which is in some respects better, is equivalent to
'the life falls away from the body of that creature.'

<span id="fn_1081"></span>[237:4](sbe0829.htm#fr_1086) This is
different, as the commentators point out, from the ordinary life-winds.

<span id="fn_1082"></span>[237:5](sbe0829.htm#fr_1087) The original here
is *g*îva, not âtman, which we have rendered 'self.' This refers rather
to the vital principle. As to the seats, cf. Yâ*g*ñavalkya Sm*ri*ti III,
93 seq.

<span id="fn_1083"></span>[237:6](sbe0829.htm#fr_1088) I adopt the
reading karma*n*âm, which I find in one of the MSS. I consulted. I think
it probable that that was the reading before the commentators. The other
reading is marma*n*âm.

<span id="fn_1084"></span>[238:1](sbe0829.htm#fr_1089) Having spoken of
heat, he now speaks of the effects of cold. I am not sure if the water
here refers to the water of the juicy' substances before referred to.

<span id="fn_1085"></span>[238:2](sbe0829.htm#fr_1090) This means, I
presume, within the dissolving body. Cf. Maitrî-upanishad, p. 42.

<span id="fn_1086"></span>[238:3](sbe0829.htm#fr_1091) See note
 [4](#fn_1081), last page.

<span id="fn_1087"></span>[238:4](sbe0829.htm#fr_1092) To the head,
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1088"></span>[238:5](sbe0829.htm#fr_1093) That is, the
wind, I suppose, and then the breath departs from the body, and the man
is said to die. 'Devoid of beauty,' further on, means, disfigured in the
state of death.

<span id="fn_1089"></span>[238:6](sbe0829.htm#fr_1094) I. e. the mind,
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1090"></span>[238:7](sbe0829.htm#fr_1095) The senses. Cf.
*S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 288.

<span id="fn_1091"></span>[238:8](sbe0829.htm#fr_1096) See and cf. [p.
262](sbe0833.htm#page_262) infra.

<span id="fn_1092"></span>[238:9](sbe0829.htm#fr_1097) This, says
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, is in answer to the possible question why this 'sharp
wind' does not work with the life-winds. The answer is, that such
working requires the presence of the soul, which Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra says
here means 'mind.' As to production from food,' cf. *Kh*ândogya, p. 421
seq., and Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka, p. 893.

<span id="fn_1093"></span>[238:10](sbe0829.htm#fr_1098) Collection of
that = turning the food into semen, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, who adds,
'in, those vital parts, which are useful for this purpose, the life-wind
dwells.'

<span id="fn_1094"></span>[239:1](sbe0829.htm#fr_1099) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
renders this to mean 'mind.'

<span id="fn_1095"></span>[239:2](sbe0829.htm#fr_1100) As the mind is
obstructed, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. The possessor of consciousness = the
self, Ar*g*una.

<span id="fn_1096"></span>[239:3](sbe0829.htm#fr_1101) I. e. pain,
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1097"></span>[239:4](sbe0829.htm#fr_1102) I. e. mind,
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1098"></span>[239:5](sbe0829.htm#fr_1103) Cf.
B*ri*hadâra*ny*aka, p. 843.

<span id="fn_1099"></span>[239:6](sbe0829.htm#fr_1104) See
Aitareya-upanishad, p. 222, and *S*a<u>n</u>kara's commentary there. The
coming to the birth is the coming out of the womb into the world. Cf.
also Gîtâ, [p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112).

<span id="fn_1100"></span>[239:7](sbe0829.htm#fr_1105) As stated further
on, viz. this world, the next world, and the womb. With this compare
*Kh*ândogya, p. 359.

<span id="fn_1101"></span>[239:8](sbe0829.htm#fr_1106) Cf. our
Bhart*ri*hari (Bombay series), Notes (Nîti*s*ataka), p. 27.

<span id="fn_1102"></span>[240:1](sbe0829.htm#fr_1107) Cf. on this and
lower place,' Gîtâ, [p. 109](sbe0816.htm#page_109); Sâ<u>n</u>khya
Kârikâ, 44.

<span id="fn_1103"></span>[240:2](sbe0829.htm#fr_1108) The readings here
are most unsatisfactory. The meaning of the printed reading adopted
above would seem to be, 'decision as to what actions should be
performed,' &c.

<span id="fn_1104"></span>[240:3](sbe0829.htm#fr_1109) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
81](sbe0810.htm#page_81), and Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p.
158](sbe0823.htm#page_158).

<span id="fn_1105"></span>[240:4](sbe0829.htm#fr_1110) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
84](sbe0811.htm#page_84).

<span id="fn_1106"></span>[240:5](sbe0829.htm#fr_1111) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says, 'In heaven = in the next world, low = inferior(?), high = heaven,
and middling = the space below the skies (antariksha).' For the three
degrees of enjoyment in heaven, see Yogavâsish*th*a I, 35 seq.

<span id="fn_1107"></span>[240:6](sbe0829.htm#fr_1112) This is the third
of the three seats above referred to.
