# CHAPTER XXXI

Brahman said .

Thus <span id="fr_1820"></span>[1](#fn_1813.md) duly studying to the best
of his power, in the way above <span id="fr_1821"></span>[2](#fn_1814.md)
stated, and likewise living as a Brahma*k*ârin, one who is devoted to
his own. duty and learned, who is a sage with all his senses restrained,
who applies himself to what is agreeable and beneficial to the
preceptor, who is pure <span id="fr_1822"></span>[3](#fn_1815.md), and
constant in veracity and piety, should, with the permission of the
preceptor, take food without decrying it <span
id="fr_1823"></span>[4](#fn_1816), should eat (the leavings.md) of
sacrificial offerings, and alms, and should stand, sit, and take
exercise <span id="fr_1824"></span>[5](#fn_1817) (duly.md), should
sacrifice twice to the fire after becoming clean and with a concentrated
(mind), and should always bear a staff of the Bilva or Palâ*s*a <span
id="fr_1825"></span>[6](#fn_1818) (wood.md). The clothing of the twice-born
(man) should be of linen, or of cotton, or also a deerskin, or a cloth
entirely (dyed with) reddish colour. There should also be a girdle of
muñ*g*a; he should have matted hair, and likewise always (carry) water
(with him), and have his sacred thread, be engaged in sacred

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

study, and free from avarice, and of rigid observances. (Such) a
Brahma*k*ârin, always making offerings likewise of pure water to satisfy
the deities, being restrained in mind <span
id="fr_1826"></span>[1](#fn_1819.md), is esteemed. One who is thus
devoted <span id="fr_1827"></span>[2](#fn_1820.md), who is concentrated in
mind, and continent <span id="fr_1828"></span>[3](#fn_1821.md), conquers
heaven, and reaching the highest seat, does not return to birth. Refined
by means of all ceremonies, and likewise living as a Brahma*k*ârin <span
id="fr_1829"></span>[4](#fn_1822.md), a sage who has renounced <span
id="fr_1830"></span>[5](#fn_1823) (all.md) should go out of towns and dwell
in forests <span id="fr_1831"></span>[6](#fn_1824.md). Wearing a skin or
the bark of a tree, he should bathe (every) morning and evening, and
always living within the forest, should not enter a town again. He
should honour guests, and should also give them shelter at (the proper)
time, living on fruits and leaves, and roots and *S*yâmâka grain. He
should without sloth feed on water, air, and all forest-products down to
grass as they come, in order <span id="fr_1832"></span>[7](#fn_1825.md), in
accordance with the (regulations <span id="fr_1833"></span>[8](#fn_1826.md)
at his) initiation. He should honour a guest who comes, by (giving him)
water accompanied with roots, fruits, and leaves. And he should always
without sloth give alms out of whatever he has for food. He should also
eat always after the deities and guests <span
id="fr_1834"></span>[9](#fn_1827.md)

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

(are satisfied) and with his speech restrained, having a mind free from
envy <span id="fr_1835"></span>[1](#fn_1828.md), eating little, and
depending on the deities. Restraining the external senses, kind, full of
forgiveness, preserving his hair and moustache, performing sacrifices,
addicted to sacred study, and devoted to veracity and piety, pure in
body <span id="fr_1836"></span>[2](#fn_1829.md), always dexterous <span
id="fr_1837"></span>[3](#fn_1830.md), always in forests, and concentrated
in mind,--a forester whose senses are subdued and who is thus
devoted <span id="fr_1838"></span>[4](#fn_1831.md) conquers the worlds. A
householder, or a Brahma*k*ârin, or again a forester, who wishes to
apply himself to final emancipation should adopt the best (line of)
conduct <span id="fr_1839"></span>[5](#fn_1832.md). Offering safety to all
beings, the sage should become free from all action <span
id="fr_1840"></span>[6](#fn_1833.md), and be agreeable to all beings, kind,
and restrained in all his senses. He should make a fire <span
id="fr_1841"></span>[7](#fn_1834) and feed on the alms (obtained.md)
without asking <span id="fr_1842"></span>[8](#fn_1835.md) and without
trouble <span id="fr_1843"></span>[9](#fn_1836.md), and which have come
spontaneously <span id="fr_1844"></span>[10](#fn_1837.md), in a place free
from smoke and where people have already <span
id="fr_1845"></span>[11](#fn_1838.md) eaten. One who

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

understands final emancipation should seek to obtain alms after the
cleaning <span id="fr_1846"></span>[1](#fn_1839.md) of the vessels (used
for cooking), and should not rejoice if he obtains, and should not be
dejected if he does not obtain (alms). Nor should he beg for too much
alms <span id="fr_1847"></span>[2](#fn_1840.md), seeking merely to sustain
life. Eating only a little, he should go about for alms with a
concentrated mind, looking out for the (proper) time. He should not wish
for earnings in common with another, nor should he eat when honoured;
for an ascetic should be averse from all earnings (accompanied) with
honour <span id="fr_1848"></span>[3](#fn_1841.md). When eating, he should
not taste any articles of food which have been eaten by others <span
id="fr_1849"></span>[4](#fn_1842.md), or which are pungent, astringent, or
bitter, and likewise no sweet juices. He should eat just enough for his
livelihood-for the support of life. One who understands final
emancipation should seek for a livelihood without obstructing (other)
creatures; and when he goes about for alms, he should not go following
after another <span id="fr_1850"></span>[5](#fn_1843.md). He should not
parade (his) piety, he should move about in a secluded place, free from
passion. He should resort for shelter to an empty house, or a forest, or
the foot of a tree, or a river likewise, or the cavern of a mountain. In
summer, (he should pass) but a single night <span
id="fr_1851"></span>[6](#fn_1844.md) in a town; and in the rains, he may
dwell in one place. He should move about the

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

world like a worm <span id="fr_1852"></span>[1](#fn_1845.md), his path
being pointed out by the sun, and he should walk with circumspection
over the earth out of compassion to all beings <span
id="fr_1853"></span>[2](#fn_1846.md). He should not make any accumulations;
and should eschew dwelling with friends <span
id="fr_1854"></span>[3](#fn_1847.md). And the man who understands final
emancipation should verily do all acts which he has to do, always with
clean water. A man should always bathe in clean water. And with his
senses restrained, he should devote himself to these eight
observances <span id="fr_1855"></span>[4](#fn_1848.md)--harmlessness, life
as a Brahmakârin, veracity, and also straightforwardness, freedom from
anger, freedom from (the habit of) carping, restraint of the external
organs, and habitual freedom from (the habit of) backbiting. He should
always practice a sinless (mode of) conduct, not deceptive and not
crooked; and free from attachment should always make one who comes (as a
guest) take a morsel of food. He should eat just enough for
livelihood-for the support of life. And he should eat (only) what has
been obtained with piety <span id="fr_1856"></span>[5](#fn_1849.md), and
should not follow his own (mere) desire <span
id="fr_1857"></span>[6](#fn_1850.md). He should not accept anything at all
other than food and clothing. And he should accept as much as he eats
and no more. He should not receive from others, nor should he ever give
to others <span id="fr_1858"></span>[7](#fn_1851.md).

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

\[paragraph continues\] But owing to the helplessness of people, a wise
man should always share (with others). He should not appropriate
another's riches, and should not take (anything) unasked. Nor, verily,
after enjoying any object should one become afterwards attached to it.
One who has anything to do <span id="fr_1859"></span>[1](#fn_1852.md)
should take earth, water, pebbles likewise, and leaves, flowers, and
fruits which are not secured <span id="fr_1860"></span>[2](#fn_1853.md) (by
anybody), as they come <span id="fr_1861"></span>[3](#fn_1854.md). One
should not live by the occupation of an artisan <span
id="fr_1862"></span>[4](#fn_1855.md), nor should one wish for gold. One
should not hate, should not teach <span
id="fr_1863"></span>[5](#fn_1856), and should be void of (all.md)
belongings <span id="fr_1864"></span>[6](#fn_1857.md). One should eat what
is consecrated by faith <span id="fr_1865"></span>[7](#fn_1858.md), and
should avoid (all) controversies, should act without a purpose <span
id="fr_1866"></span>[8](#fn_1859.md), should be free from attachment, and
without fixed appointments with people <span
id="fr_1867"></span>[9](#fn_1860.md). One should not perform, or cause to
be performed, any action involving expectation of fruit, or involving
any destruction of life, or the assemblage of people <span
id="fr_1868"></span>[10](#fn_1861.md). Rejecting all things,

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

and being equable to all beings, moving and unmoving, one should become
an ascetic with small belongings. One should not perturb any other
(person), nor should one be perturbed by any other (person <span
id="fr_1869"></span>[1](#fn_1862).md). He who is trusted by all beings is
said to be the foremost among those who understand final emancipation.
One should not think of what is not come <span
id="fr_1870"></span>[2](#fn_1863.md), nor reflect on that which is past;
one should disregard the present, being concentrated (in mind) and
indifferent to time <span id="fr_1871"></span>[3](#fn_1864.md). He should
not defile <span id="fr_1872"></span>[4](#fn_1865.md) anything by the eye,
or the mind, or by speech, nor should he do anything wrong openly or in
secret. One who draws in the senses from all sides as a tortoise (draws
in) his limbs <span id="fr_1873"></span>[5](#fn_1866.md), and in whom the
senses, mind, and understanding are absorbed <span
id="fr_1874"></span>[6](#fn_1867.md), who is free from desires, who
understands all truth, who is free from the pairs of opposites, and from
the ceremony of svâhâ, and who is free from salutations <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[7](#fn_1868.md), and who is free from (the thought
that this or that is) mine, who is free from egoism, who is free from
anxiety for new acquisitions or protection of old acquisitions, and
self-controlled <span id="fr_1876"></span>[8](#fn_1869.md), who is free
from

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

expectations, who is free from attachments to any entity, and who is
dependent on none <span id="fr_1877"></span>[1](#fn_1870.md), who is
attached to the self, and who understands the truth, is emancipated,
there is no doubt of that. Those who perceive the self, which is without
hands, foot, or back, without a head, without a stomach, which is free
from the operations of the qualities <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[2](#fn_1871.md), absolute, untainted, and stable,
devoid of smell, devoid of taste or touch, devoid. of colour, and also
devoid of sound, which is to be understood <span
id="fr_1879"></span>[3](#fn_1872.md), which is unattached, and which is
also devoid of flesh, which is free from anxiety <span
id="fr_1880"></span>[4](#fn_1873.md), imperishable, divine, and though
dwelling in a house <span id="fr_1881"></span>[5](#fn_1874.md), always
dwelling in all entities, they never die <span
id="fr_1882"></span>[6](#fn_1875.md). There the understanding reaches not,
nor the senses, nor the deities, nor Vedas, sacrifices, nor worlds <span
id="fr_1883"></span>[7](#fn_1876.md), nor penance., nor valour <span
id="fr_1884"></span>[8](#fn_1877.md); the attainment to it of those who are
possessed of knowledge is stated to be without comprehension of
symbols <span id="fr_1885"></span>[9](#fn_1878.md). Therefore the learned
man who knows (the) property of being void of symbols <span
id="fr_1886"></span>[10](#fn_1879.md), being devoted to pious conduct, and

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

resorting to concealed <span id="fr_1887"></span>[1](#fn_1880.md) piety
should adopt the mode of life (necessary) for experience <span
id="fr_1888"></span>[2](#fn_1881.md). Though undeluded, he should act in
the manner of the deluded <span id="fr_1889"></span>[3](#fn_1882.md), not
finding fault with piety <span id="fr_1890"></span>[4](#fn_1883.md). He
should perform piety, behaving so that others would always disrespect
him <span id="fr_1891"></span>[5](#fn_1884.md), and should not find fault
with the ways of the good <span id="fr_1892"></span>[6](#fn_1885.md). That
sage is said to be the best who has adopted this (line of) conduct. The
senses, and the objects of the senses, and the five great elements, and
mind, understanding, egoism, the unperceived, and the Purusha
likewise <span id="fr_1893"></span>[7](#fn_1886.md), by an accurate
determination about the truth, after understanding all these, one
attains heaven <span id="fr_1894"></span>[8](#fn_1887.md), being released
from all bonds. One who knows the truth, understanding these same
(entities) at the time of the termination (of his life), should
meditate, exclusively pondering on one point <span
id="fr_1895"></span>[9](#fn_1888.md); and then, depending on none <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[10](#fn_1889.md), he gets emancipation. Freed from all
attachments, like the atmosphere dwelling in space <span
id="fr_1897"></span>[11](#fn_1890.md), with his accumulations <span
id="fr_1898"></span>[12](#fn_1891.md) exhausted, and free from
distress <span id="fr_1899"></span>[13](#fn_1892.md), he attains to the
highest seat.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1813"></span>[360:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1820.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says, 'Having described first the order of householder, as that is the
chief, he now describes that of Brahmakârin.' Cf. Âpastamba II, 9, 21,
1, and note.

<span id="fn_1814"></span>[360:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1821.md) Where? This is
obscure.

<span id="fn_1815"></span>[360:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1822.md) Both internally
and externally, I presume.

<span id="fn_1816"></span>[360:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1823.md) Cf. Taittirîya,
p. 129; *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha), chap. 192, st. 6.

<span id="fn_1817"></span>[360:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1824.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
69](sbe0808.htm#page_69.md). Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra says, 'Having exercise by
means of standing and sitting; the meaning is not sleeping except at the
proper time.'

<span id="fn_1818"></span>[360:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1825.md) Cf. Manu II, 41
seq.

<span id="fn_1819"></span>[361:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1826.md) Or it may be,
'being self-restrained and with (all his) heart.' The constructions in
the original vary greatly, and so they do in the translation.

<span id="fn_1820"></span>[361:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1827.md) Applying himself
to his duties.

<span id="fn_1821"></span>[361:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1828.md) Cf. Maitrî, p.
18, and comment there.

<span id="fn_1822"></span>[361:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1829.md) Cf. Manu VI, 1
seq.

<span id="fn_1823"></span>[361:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1830.md) I. e. who is a
mendicant ascetic.

<span id="fn_1824"></span>[361:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1831.md) Cf. [p.
173](sbe0824.htm#page_173) supra, note  [9](sbe0824.htm#fn_810.md). Here he
gives a. description of the third order of forester, as to which compare
generally Manu VI.

<span id="fn_1825"></span>[361:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1832.md) First the
jungle-products, then air, &c., Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. The sense seems to be
that the restrictions should become gradually harder. Cf. Manu VI,
24-31; Âpastamba II, 9, 22, 2 seq.; II, 9, 23, 2.

<span id="fn_1826"></span>[361:8](sbe0858.htm#fr_1833.md) I. e. whatever
restriction he put on himself when entering upon the particular mode of
life.

<span id="fn_1827"></span>[361:9](sbe0858.htm#fr_1834.md) Supra, [p.
358](sbe0857.htm#page_358.md), and cf. Taittirîya, p. 38.

<span id="fn_1828"></span>[362:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1835.md) I. e. of others
for obtaining more, and so forth. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's reading is
different, and he renders it to mean, 'one by whom the rule of life as a
Brahma*k*ârin has not been violated.'

<span id="fn_1829"></span>[362:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1836.md) Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra's reading, 'one who has cast away (all attachment to) the body.'
Compare as to hair and moustache, Manu VI, 6 seq.

<span id="fn_1830"></span>[362:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1837.md) See Gîtâ, [p.
127](sbe0820.htm#page_127.md). Here the meaning is probably assiduous in
the performance of duties, vows, and so forth.

<span id="fn_1831"></span>[362:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1838.md) I. e. applies
himself to his duties.

<span id="fn_1832"></span>[362:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1839.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says this means ânandâ*s*ramam, but there must be some bad copying here.
I take the word as it stands to mean something like the 'godlike
endowments' at Gîtâ, [p. 114](sbe0817.htm#page_114.md).

<span id="fn_1833"></span>[362:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1840.md) See Gîtâ, pp.
[54](sbe0805.htm#page_54), [127](sbe0820.htm#page_127.md). The meaning here
is probably that of action without egoism. See Gîtâ, [p.
55](sbe0805.htm#page_55.md).

<span id="fn_1834"></span>[362:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1841.md) I. e. Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra says, 'not at night.' The readings are unsatisfactory. I read
k*ri*tvâ vahnim, but diffidently. Is the allusion to the rule at
Âpastamba II, 9, 2 1, 10? Cf. Gautama III, 2 7.

<span id="fn_1835"></span>[362:8](sbe0858.htm#fr_1842.md) Cf. Kaushîtaki,
p. 32.

<span id="fn_1836"></span>[362:9](sbe0858.htm#fr_1843.md) I. e. to the
giver. Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 120](sbe0819.htm#page_120.md).

<span id="fn_1837"></span>[362:10](sbe0858.htm#fr_1844.md) See Gîtâ, [p.
10](sbe0802.htm#page_10.md).

<span id="fn_1838"></span>[362:11](sbe0858.htm#fr_1845.md) Cf. Manu VI, 56;
Gautama III, 15.

<span id="fn_1839"></span>[363:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1846.md) I. e., I presume,
in order to avoid interfering with others' comforts. And see last note.

<span id="fn_1840"></span>[363:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1847.md) See Manu VI, 55.
As to proper time further on, see last note.

<span id="fn_1841"></span>[363:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1848.md) Cf.
Sanatsu*g*âtîya, pp.
[45](sbe0804.htm#page_45)-[147](sbe0821.htm#page_147.md); 'without respect'
at Gîtâ, [p. 120](sbe0819.htm#page_120.md), means probably with disrespect,
otherwise that passage and this would be somewhat inconsistent. See too
Manu II, 162.

<span id="fn_1842"></span>[363:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1849.md) Cf. Manu II, 56;
Gîtâ, [p. 118](sbe0819.htm#page_118); and [p. 269](sbe0834.htm#page_269.md)
supra.

<span id="fn_1843"></span>[363:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1850.md) As that other may
get nothing if they go together, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra Cf. Manu VI, 51.

<span id="fn_1844"></span>[363:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1851.md) Cf. Gautama III,
21.

<span id="fn_1845"></span>[364:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1852.md) I. e. not very
fast, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra; 'the path being pointed out by the sun' = not at
night, for fear of destroying worms, &c.

<span id="fn_1846"></span>[364:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1853.md) This seems to be
very like the practice of the Gainas of the present day. And cf. Manu
VI, 69.

<span id="fn_1847"></span>[364:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1854.md) Cf. Gîtâ, pp.
[68](sbe0808.htm#page_68)-[103](sbe0815.htm#page_103.md).

<span id="fn_1848"></span>[364:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1855.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
114](sbe0817.htm#page_114.md), and cf. also Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p.
153](sbe0823.htm#page_153.md).

<span id="fn_1849"></span>[364:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1856.md) That is to say,
obtained without violation of any binding obligation, or rule of the
Sâstras.

<span id="fn_1850"></span>[364:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1857.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
117](sbe0818.htm#page_117.md).

<span id="fn_1851"></span>[364:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1858.md) This is not very
clear, and Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's comments are not intelligible. The sense
seems to be this, 'He should not take more than is wanted, nor should he
keep any accumulations from which to give to others, but should at once
share with others all that is earned.'

<span id="fn_1852"></span>[365:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1859.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says that this means if he wants them for any particular purpose he
should take the earth, &c.

<span id="fn_1853"></span>[365:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1860.md) I. e. apparently,
taken possession of and preserved as one's own by anybody.

<span id="fn_1854"></span>[365:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1861.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
renders this by 'which lead to action.' Is it not rather the
'spontaneous earnings' at Gîtâ, [p. 60](sbe0806.htm#page_60.md)?

<span id="fn_1855"></span>[365:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1862.md) Cf. Manu III, 64;
Âpastamba I, 6, 18, 18; Gautama XVII, 7.

<span id="fn_1856"></span>[365:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1863.md) I. e. teach one
who does not ask to be instructed. Cf. Manu II, 110.

<span id="fn_1857"></span>[365:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1864.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
60](sbe0806.htm#page_60.md); the original word, however, is not the same.

<span id="fn_1858"></span>[365:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1865.md) See [p.
360](sbe0857.htm#page_360), note  [3](#fn_1815.md) supra; Manu II, 54-55;
Gautama IX) 59. 'Controversies;' the original is nimitta, and the
interpretation is what appears to be Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's. It may also
mean 'omens.' That this is the true sense appears from Manu VI, 50.

<span id="fn_1859"></span>[365:8](sbe0858.htm#fr_1866.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
48](sbe0804.htm#page_48.md).

<span id="fn_1860"></span>[365:9](sbe0858.htm#fr_1867.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says, 'e. g. I shall come to you to-morrow for alms,' &c. Cf. Âpastamba
I, 6, 19, 12.

<span id="fn_1861"></span>[365:10](sbe0858.htm#fr_1868.md) The words are
the same as at Gîtâ, [p. 54](sbe0805.htm#page_54.md), keeping people (to
<span id="page_366">p. 366</span> their duties),' but the sense seems to
be different. The commentators say nothing on this.

<span id="fn_1862"></span>[366:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1869.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
101](sbe0814.htm#page_101.md).

<span id="fn_1863"></span>[366:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1870.md) I. e. one should
not look to the future with any aspirations or expectations, and should
not look back on the past with grief. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. See too [p.
170](sbe0824.htm#page_170), note  [9](sbe0824.htm#fn_784.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1864"></span>[366:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1871.md) I am not sure if
this is a correct interpretation. But it does not seem likely that the
other possible sense--literally 'expecting time'--can be intended here.

<span id="fn_1865"></span>[366:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1872.md) This is obscure.
Is the sense this, that one should not observe, or think, or speak badly
or of the bad side of things?

<span id="fn_1866"></span>[366:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1873.md) Cf. [p.
342](sbe0854.htm#page_342) supra, note  [1](sbe0854.htm#fn_1670.md).

<span id="fn_1867"></span>[366:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1874.md) Cf. Ka*th*a, p.
151.

<span id="fn_1868"></span>[366:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1875.md) See [p.
352](sbe0855.htm#page_352) supra, note  [1](sbe0856.htm#fn_1749.md).

<span id="fn_1869"></span>[366:8](sbe0858.htm#fr_1876.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
48](sbe0804.htm#page_48.md), where the original words are the same.

<span id="fn_1870"></span>[367:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1877.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
60](sbe0806.htm#page_60.md).

<span id="fn_1871"></span>[367:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1878.md) These are effects
of Prak*ri*ti by which the Purusha is unaffected.

<span id="fn_1872"></span>[367:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1879.md) Literally,
'pursued.'

<span id="fn_1873"></span>[367:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1880.md) This is obscure.
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's text is nis*k*ityam. Does that mean 'which should be
accurately understood?' The rendering in the text of Nîlaka*nth*a's
reading may mean that the Brahman has no such thoughts (*k*intâ) as are
referred to at Gîtâ, [p. 115](sbe0818.htm#page_115.md).

<span id="fn_1874"></span>[367:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1881.md) Does this mean
the body?

<span id="fn_1875"></span>[367:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1882.md) I. e. are free
from birth and death. Cf. Âpastamba I, 8, 22, 4.

<span id="fn_1876"></span>[367:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1883.md) This, again, is
not quite clear. Probably the explanation is to be found in the passage
at Gîtâ [p. 79](sbe0810.htm#page_79.md).

<span id="fn_1877"></span>[367:8](sbe0858.htm#fr_1884.md) Nîlaka*nth*a's
reading is 'observances or vows.'

<span id="fn_1878"></span>[367:9](sbe0858.htm#fr_1885.md) I. e. 'not to be
acquired by inference,' Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, [p. 35](sbe0802.htm#page_35.md),
supra.

<span id="fn_1879"></span>[367:10](sbe0858.htm#fr_1886.md) See [p.
309](sbe0846.htm#page_309.md) supra; 'who is without symbols, and knows
piety,' according to Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's reading.

<span id="fn_1880"></span>[368:1](sbe0858.htm#fr_1887.md) See [p.
159](sbe0823.htm#page_159) supra, note  [7](sbe0823.htm#fn_685.md), and cf.
Manu III, 109, which is the text referred to in note 5 there.

<span id="fn_1881"></span>[368:2](sbe0858.htm#fr_1888.md) I. e. direct
perception of the Brahman. See Gîtâ, [p. 57](sbe0805.htm#page_57.md), note
 [5](sbe0805.htm#fn_181.md).

<span id="fn_1882"></span>[368:3](sbe0858.htm#fr_1889.md) See [p.
160](sbe0823.htm#page_160) supra, note  [8](sbe0823.htm#fn_693.md), and cf.
also Manu II, 110.

<span id="fn_1883"></span>[368:4](sbe0858.htm#fr_1890.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
compares Gîtâ, [p. 55](sbe0805.htm#page_55.md), about 'shaking
convictions.'

<span id="fn_1884"></span>[368:5](sbe0858.htm#fr_1891.md) Cf. pp.
[159](sbe0823.htm#page_159)-[161](sbe0823.htm#page_161.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1885"></span>[368:6](sbe0858.htm#fr_1892.md) This means, I
presume, the good devoted to action and not to knowledge only.

<span id="fn_1886"></span>[368:7](sbe0858.htm#fr_1893.md) These are the
famous elements of the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas; see Sûtra I, 61.

<span id="fn_1887"></span>[368:8](sbe0858.htm#fr_1894.md) Cf. [p.
159](sbe0823.htm#page_159) and note  [2](sbe0823.htm#fn_680.md).

<span id="fn_1888"></span>[368:9](sbe0858.htm#fr_1895.md) Cf. [p.
300](sbe0842.htm#page_300.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1889"></span>[368:10](sbe0858.htm#fr_1896.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
60](sbe0806.htm#page_60.md).

<span id="fn_1890"></span>[368:11](sbe0858.htm#fr_1897.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
82](sbe0811.htm#page_82), note  [3](sbe0811.htm#fn_315.md).

<span id="fn_1891"></span>[368:12](sbe0858.htm#fr_1898.md) Of actions
previously performed. See [p. 246](sbe0831.htm#page_246.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1892"></span>[368:13](sbe0858.htm#fr_1899.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
101](sbe0814.htm#page_101.md), where, however, the original word is
different.
