# CHAPTER XIII.

The Deity said:

This body, O son of Kuntî! is called Kshetra <span
id="fr_418"></span>[1](#fn_417.md), and the learned call him who knows it
the Kshetra*g*ña. <span id="fr_419"></span>[2](#fn_418.md). And know me
also, O descendant of Bharata! to be the Kshetra*g*ña in all Kshetras.
The knowledge of Kshetra and Kshetra*g*ña is deemed by me (to be real)
knowledge. Now hear from me in brief what that Kshetra (is), what (it
is) like, what changes (it undergoes), and whence (it comes), and what
is he <span id="fr_420"></span>[3](#fn_419.md), and what his powers, (all
which) is sung in various ways by sages in numerous hymns <span
id="fr_421"></span>[4](#fn_420.md), distinctly, and in well-settled texts
full of argument, giving indications or full instruction about the
Brahman. The great elements <span id="fr_422"></span>[5](#fn_421.md),
egoism, the understanding, the unperceived also, the ten senses, and the
one, and the five objects of sense, desire,

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

aversion, pleasure, pain, body, consciousness, courage, thus in brief
has been declared the Kshetra with changes <span
id="fr_423"></span>[1](#fn_422.md). Absence of vanity, absence of
ostentatiousness, absence of hurtfulness, forgiveness,
straightforwardness, devotion to a preceptor, purity <span
id="fr_424"></span>[2](#fn_423.md), steadiness, self-restraint,
indifference towards objects of sense, and also absence of egoism;
perception of the misery and evil of birth, death <span
id="fr_425"></span>[3](#fn_424.md), old age, and disease; absence of
attachment, absence of self-identifying regard for son, wife <span
id="fr_426"></span>[4](#fn_425.md), home, and so forth; and constant
equability on the approach of (both what is) agreeable and (what is)
disagreeable; unswerving devotion to me, without meditation on any one
else; resorting to clean places, distaste for assemblages of men <span
id="fr_427"></span>[5](#fn_426.md), constancy in knowledge of the relation
of the individual self to the supreme, perception of the object  <span
id="fr_428"></span>[6](#fn_427.md) of knowledge of the truth, this is
called knowledge; that is ignorance which is opposed to this. I will
declare that which is the object of knowledge, knowing which, one
reaches immortality; the highest Brahman, having no beginning nor end,
which cannot be said to be existent or non-existent <span
id="fr_429"></span>[7](#fn_428.md). It has hands and feet on all sides, it
has eyes, heads, and faces on all sides, it has ears on all sides, it

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

stands pervading everything in the world. Possessed of the qualities of
all the senses, (but) devoid of all senses <span
id="fr_430"></span>[1](#fn_429.md), unattached, it supports all, is devoid
of qualities, and the enjoyer <span id="fr_431"></span>[2](#fn_430.md) of
qualities. It is within all things and without them; it is movable and
also immovable; it is unknowable through (its) subtlety; it stands afar
and near <span id="fr_432"></span>[3](#fn_431.md). Not different in
(different) things <span id="fr_433"></span>[4](#fn_432.md), but standing
as though different, it should be known to be the supporter of (all)
things, and that which absorbs and creates (them). It is the radiance
even of the radiant (bodies); it is said (to be) beyond darkness. It is
knowledge, the object of knowledge, that which is to be attained to by
knowledge, and placed in the heart of all <span
id="fr_434"></span>[5](#fn_433.md). Thus in brief have Kshetra, knowledge,
and the object of knowledge been declared. My devotee, knowing this,
becomes fit for assimilation with me. Know nature and spirit both (to
be) without beginning, and know all developments and qualities <span
id="fr_435"></span>[6](#fn_434) (to be.md) produced from nature. Nature is
said to be the origin of the capacity of working (residing) in the body
and the senses; and spirit is said (to be) the origin of the capacity of
enjoying pleasures and

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

pains <span id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_435.md). For spirit with nature
joined, enjoys the qualities born of nature. And the cause of its birth
in good or evil wombs is the connexion with the qualities <span
id="fr_437"></span>[2](#fn_436.md). The supreme spirit in this body is
called supervisor, adviser <span id="fr_438"></span>[3](#fn_437.md),
supporter, enjoyer, the great lord, and the supreme self also. He who
thus knows nature and spirit, together with the qualities, is not born
again, however living <span id="fr_439"></span>[4](#fn_438.md). Some by
concentration see the self in the self by the self; others by the
Sâ<u>n</u>kya-yoga; and others still by the Karma-yoga <span
id="fr_440"></span>[5](#fn_439.md); others yet, not knowing this, practise
concentration, after hearing from others <span
id="fr_441"></span>[6](#fn_440). They, too, being (thus.md) devoted to
hearing (instruction) cross beyond death. Whatever thing movable or
immovable comes into existence, know that to be from the connexion of
Kshetra and Kshetra*g*ña, O chief of the descendants of Bharata! He sees
(truly)

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

who sees the supreme lord abiding alike in all entities, and not
destroyed though they are destroyed. For he who sees the lord abiding
everywhere alike, does not destroy himself <span
id="fr_442"></span>[1](sbe0816.htm#fn_441.md)by himself, and then reaches
the highest goal. He sees (truly), who sees (all) actions (to be) in
every way done by nature alone, and likewise the self (to be) not the
doer. When a man sees all the variety of entities as existing in
one <span id="fr_443"></span>[2](sbe0816.htm#fn_442), and (all as.md)
emanating from that, then he becomes (one with) the Brahman. This
inexhaustible supreme self, being without beginning and without
qualities, does not act, and is not tainted, O son of Kuntî! though
stationed in the body. As by (reason of its) subtlety the all-pervading
space is not tainted, so the self stationed in every body is not
tainted. As the sun singly lights up all this world, so the
Kshetra*g*ña, O descendant of Bharata! lights up the whole Kshetra.
Those who, with the eye of knowledge, thus understand the difference
between Kshetra and Kshetra*g*ña, and the destruction of the nature of
all entities <span id="fr_444"></span>[3](sbe0816.htm#fn_443.md), go to the
supreme.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_417"></span>[102:1](sbe0815.htm#fr_418.md) I retain the

*S*vetâ*s*vataropanishad, p. 368, and Maitrî, pp. 25-72.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[102:3](sbe0815.htm#fr_420.md) I. e. the
Kshetra*g*ña.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[102:4](sbe0815.htm#fr_421.md) Hymns = scil. from
the Vedas about ordinary or special actions and so forth. Argument =
e.g. in texts like 'How can entity come from non-entity? Who could
breathe, if &c.?'

<span id="fn_421"></span>[102:5](sbe0815.htm#fr_422.md) Cf.
Aitareya-âra*n*yaka, p. 97. The subtle elements, earth, fire, &c., are
meant. The unperceived = nature; the one = mind; courage = that by which
the drooping body and senses are supported; egoism =
self-consciousness-the feeling 'this is I.'

<span id="fn_422"></span>[103:1](sbe0815.htm#fr_423.md) See the last page.
Changes = development.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[103:2](sbe0815.htm#fr_424.md) Internal as well as
external; as to devotion to a preceptor, cf. Âpastamba, p. 11 (p. 23 in
this series); Taittirîya-upanishad, p. 38; *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 117; and
Sutta Nipâta, p. 87; as to egoism, see [p. 52](sbe0804.htm#page_52.md)
supra.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[103:3](sbe0815.htm#fr_425.md) Cf. Sutta Nipâta,
pp. 18-95.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[103:4](sbe0815.htm#fr_426.md) Cf. Sutta Nipâta,
p. 12.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[103:5](sbe0815.htm#fr_427.md) Cf. Sutta Nipâta,
p. 11.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[103:6](sbe0815.htm#fr_428.md) Viz. removal of
ignorance and acquisition of happiness.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[103:7](sbe0815.htm#fr_429.md) Words indicate a
class, a quality, an action, or a relation, says *S*a<u>n</u>kara. None
of these can be predicated of the Brahman; so you cannot apply either of
these words to it. Cf. pp. [84](sbe0811.htm#page_84.md),
[96](sbe0813.htm#page_96.md) supra, also *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 346.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[104:1](sbe0815.htm#fr_430.md) Cf.
*S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 331. He has no ears, but has the quality of
hearing, and so forth; unattached = really out of relation to
everything, though seeming to be connected with other things through
delusion.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[104:2](sbe0815.htm#fr_431.md) I. e. he perceives
them.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[104:3](sbe0815.htm#fr_432.md) Î*s*opanishad, p.
12; Mu*nd*aka, p. 313.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[104:4](sbe0815.htm#fr_433.md) Everything being
really one. Cf. inter alia, [p. 124](sbe0820.htm#page_124.md) infra. The
various manifestations of The Brahman are really one in essence, though
apparently different, like foam and water.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[104:5](sbe0815.htm#fr_434.md) Cf. [p.
88](sbe0812.htm#page_88.md).

<span id="fn_434"></span>[104:6](sbe0815.htm#fr_435.md) Developments =
body, senses, &c. Qualities = pleasure, pain, &c.; altogether the
expression means the body and feelings and so forth.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[105:1](sbe0815.htm#fr_436.md) *S*rîdhara says
that 'is said to be' means by Kapila and others. For the notion that
activity is not a function of the soul, see inter alia, [p.
55](sbe0805.htm#page_55.md) supra. Enjoyment, however, is, according to
this passage, the function of the soul, not of nature. See also
Maitrî-upanishad, pp. 107, 108.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[105:2](sbe0815.htm#fr_437.md) I. e. 'the senses,'
says *S*rîdhara; good = gods, &c. evil beasts, &c.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[105:3](sbe0815.htm#fr_438.md) Scil. concerning
the operations of the body and senses. Cf. N*ri*si*m*ha-tâpinî, p. 224.
He is adviser because, though he does not interfere, he sees and
therefore may be said to sanction the operations alluded to. Supporter,
i. e. of body &c. in their workings.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[105:4](sbe0815.htm#fr_439.md) I. e. though he may
have transgressed rules.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[105:5](sbe0815.htm#fr_440.md) Concentration =
fixing of the mind exclusively on the soul, the senses being quiescent.
'See the self,' i. e. the soul; 'in the self,' i. e. within themselves;
'by the self,' i. e. by the mind. Sâ<u>n</u>khya-yoga = belief that
qualities are distinct from the self, which is only a passive spectator
of their operations. Cf. *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 109. Karma-yoga =
dedication of actions to the supreme. Cf. as to this the gloss on
*S*a<u>n</u>kara's Bhâshya on Vedânta-sûtra IV, 2, 21.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[105:6](sbe0815.htm#fr_441.md) Cf. Sutta Nipâta,
