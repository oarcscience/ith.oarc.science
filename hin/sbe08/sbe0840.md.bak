# CHAPTER XIII.

The Brâhma*n*a said:

I do not smell smells, I perceive no tastes, I see no colour, and I do
not touch, nor yet do I hear various sounds, nor even do I entertain any
fancies <span id="fr_1396"></span>[5](#fn_1391.md). Nature desires objects
which are liked; nature hates all (objects) which are hateful <span
id="fr_1397"></span>[6](#fn_1392.md). Desire and hatred are born from
nature <span id="fr_1398"></span>[7](#fn_1393.md)as the upward and

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

downward life-winds, after attaining to the bodies of living creatures.
Apart from them, and as the constant entity underlying them, I see the
individual self in the body. Dwelling in that (self), I am in no wise
attached <span id="fr_1399"></span>[1](#fn_1394) (to anything.md) through
desire or anger, or old age, or death. Not desiring any object of
desire, not hating any evil, there is no taint on my natures <span
id="fr_1400"></span>[2](#fn_1395), as there is no (taint.md) of a drop of
water on lotuses <span id="fr_1401"></span>[3](#fn_1396.md). They are
inconstant things appertaining to this constant (principle) which looks
on various natures. Although actions are performed, the net of
enjoyments does not attach itself to it, as the net of the sun's rays
does not attach itself to the sky <span
id="fr_1402"></span>[4](#fn_1397.md). On this <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[5](#fn_1398.md), too, they relate an ancient story,
(in the shape of) a dialogue between an Adhvaryu priest and an ascetic.
Understand that, O glorious one! Seeing an animal being sprinkled <span
id="fr_1404"></span>[6](#fn_1399.md) at a sacrificial ceremony, an ascetic
who was sitting (there) spoke to the Adhvaryu, censuring (the act) as
destruction of life. The Adhvaryu

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

answered him (saying), this goat will not be destroyed. (This) creature
will obtain welfare, since the Vedic text is such. For that part of him
which is of the earth will go to the earth; whatever in him is produced
from water, that will enter water. His eye (will enter) the sun, (his)
ear the quarters, and his life-winds likewise the sky <span
id="fr_1405"></span>[1](#fn_1400.md). There is no offence on my part,
adhering (as I do) to the scriptures <span
id="fr_1406"></span>[2](#fn_1401.md).

The Ascetic said:

If you perceive (that) good (will) result upon his life being severed
(from him), then the sacrifice is for the goat, what benefit (is it) to
you? Let the brother, father, mother, and friend (of the goat) give you
their consent <span id="fr_1407"></span>[3](#fn_1402.md); take him (to
them) and consult (them), especially as he is dependent. You ought to
inquire of those who can give their consent thus. After hearing their
consent, (the matter) will be fit for consideration <span
id="fr_1408"></span>[4](#fn_1403.md). The life-winds <span
id="fr_1409"></span>[5](#fn_1404.md), too, of this goat have gone to their
sources, and I think only his unmoving body remains. To those who wish
to derive enjoyment from the slaughter (of a living creature), the
unconscious body being comparable to fuel, that which is called an
animal becomes

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

the fuel <span id="fr_1410"></span>[1](#fn_1405.md). The teaching of the
elders <span id="fr_1411"></span>[2](#fn_1406.md) is, that refraining from
slaughter (of living creatures) is (the duty) among all duties. We
maintain that that action should be performed which involves no
slaughter. (Our) proposition is no slaughter (of living creatures). If I
spoke further, it would be possible to find fault with your proceedings
in many ways <span id="fr_1412"></span>[3](#fn_1407.md). Always refraining
from the slaughter of all beings is what we approve. We substantiate
(this) from what is actually visible <span
id="fr_1413"></span>[4](#fn_1408.md), we do not rely on what is not
visible.

The Adhvaryu said:

You enjoy the earth's quality of fragrance, you drink watery juices, you
see the colours of shining bodies, you touch the qualities of the air,
you hear the sound produced in space, you think by the mind (on the
objects of) mental operations. And all these entities, you believe, have
life. You have not (then) abstained from taking life. You are (engaged)
in the slaughter (of living creatures) <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[5](#fn_1409.md). There is no movement <span
id="fr_1415"></span>[6](#fn_1410.md) without slaughter (of living
creatures). Or what do you think, O twice-born one?

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

The Ascetic said

The indestructible and the destructible, such is the double
manifestation of the self. Of these the indestructible is the
existent <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1](#fn_1411.md), the manifestation as
an individual <span id="fr_1417"></span>[2](#fn_1412) (entity.md) is called
the destructible <span id="fr_1418"></span>[3](#fn_1413.md). The
life-winds, the tongue, the mind, and (the quality of) goodness,
together with (the quality of) passion <span
id="fr_1419"></span>[4](#fn_1414), (these make up.md) the manifestations as
individual entities. And to one who is free from these manifestations,
who is free from the pairs of opposites, who is devoid of expectations,
who is alike to all beings, who is free from (the thought that this or
that is) mine, who has subdued his self, and who is released on all
hands <span id="fr_1420"></span>[5](#fn_1415.md), there is no fear
anywhere <span id="fr_1421"></span>[6](#fn_1416.md).

The Adhvaryu said:

O best of talented men! one should in this (world)

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

dwell in company of good men only <span
id="fr_1422"></span>[1](sbe0841.htm#fn_1417.md). For having heard your
opinion, my mind is enlightened. O venerable sir! I approach you, in the
belief (that you are) the Lord; and I say (to you), O twice-born one!
there is no fault (attaching) to me, performing (as I have done) the
rites performed by others <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[2](sbe0841.htm#fn_1418.md).

The Brâhma*n*a said:

With this explanation, the ascetic thereafter remained silent, and the
Adhvaryu also proceeded with the great sacrifice, freed from delusion.
Thus Brâhma*n*as understand the very subtle emancipation to be of this
nature, and understanding it, they act (accordingly), being directed by
the Kshetra*g*ña.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1387"></span>[288:1](sbe0839.htm#fr_1392.md) Literally,
'lean.'

<span id="fn_1388"></span>[288:2](sbe0839.htm#fr_1393.md) I. e. the body in
the soul, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1389"></span>[288:3](sbe0839.htm#fr_1394.md) Knowledge is
Brahman, which is described as a forest here, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1390"></span>[288:4](sbe0839.htm#fr_1395.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
70](sbe0808.htm#page_70.md).

<span id="fn_1391"></span>[288:5](sbe0840.htm#fr_1396.md) This is the name
for the operations of the mind.

<span id="fn_1392"></span>[288:6](sbe0840.htm#fr_1397.md) The sense is
similar to that at Gîtâ, [p. 55](sbe0805.htm#page_55.md). The self has
nothing to do with these feelings; the qualities deal with the
qualities.

<span id="fn_1393"></span>[288:7](sbe0840.htm#fr_1398.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
65](sbe0807.htm#page_65.md). The meaning of nature here, as in the Gîtâ, is
in substance the result of all previous action with which the self has
been associated, which result, of course, exists connected not with the
self, but with the developments of nature, in the form of body, <span
id="page_289">p. 289</span> senses, &c. The comparison appears to mean
that the feelings of desire &c. are, like the life--winds, unconnected
with the self, though associated with it, and are both alike
manifestations of nature.

<span id="fn_1394"></span>[289:1](sbe0840.htm#fr_1399.md) Nîlaka*nth*a
compares B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 770. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra has a different
reading, meaning 'liable (to be subjugated).'

<span id="fn_1395"></span>[289:2](sbe0840.htm#fr_1400.md) The plural. which
is in the original, is unusual. The various aspects of the 'result'
stated in [p. 288](sbe0839.htm#page_288), note  [7](#fn_1393.md), being
looked at separately, are described as 'natures,' like the leaves of a
lotus, which in their ensemble make one lotus.

<span id="fn_1396"></span>[289:3](sbe0840.htm#fr_1401.md) Lalita Vistara,
p. 2, and [p. 64](sbe0807.htm#page_64.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1397"></span>[289:4](sbe0840.htm#fr_1402.md) The figure seems
to be somewhat like that at Gîtâ, [p. 82](sbe0811.htm#page_82.md), about
the atmosphere and space, which latter remains untainted by the former.
Looking on various natures, i. e. as distinct from the self.

<span id="fn_1398"></span>[289:5](sbe0840.htm#fr_1403.md) Viz. the
remaining untainted.

<span id="fn_1399"></span>[289:6](sbe0840.htm#fr_1404.md) I. e. with water,
preparatory to its being offered up for the sacrifice.

<span id="fn_1400"></span>[290:1](sbe0840.htm#fr_1405.md) Cf.
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 542, and [p. 337](sbe0854.htm#page_337.md) below.

<span id="fn_1401"></span>[290:2](sbe0840.htm#fr_1406.md) Cf.
*Kh*ândogya-upanishad, p. 627, and also *S*ârîraka Bhâshya on Sûtra III,
1, 25, p. 774.

<span id="fn_1402"></span>[290:3](sbe0840.htm#fr_1407.md) I. e. for his
slaughter, which is to bring welfare to the goat. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra says
that this is a sort of reductio ad absurdum, as the sacrifice is in
truth not in the interests of the goat at all.

<span id="fn_1403"></span>[290:4](sbe0840.htm#fr_1408.md) Viz. whether the
goat should be killed. Without their consent he ought not to be
slaughtered; with their consent, it becomes a matter for consideration,
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1404"></span>[290:5](sbe0840.htm#fr_1409.md) It may also mean
the senses, as in the *Kh*ândogya, p. 297.

<span id="fn_1405"></span>[291:1](sbe0840.htm#fr_1410.md) This is not very
clear, but the meaning seems to be that the slaughter is committed for
the enjoyment of the sacrificer; the sacrificer only requires fuel, and
the slaughtered animal is then used for that purpose.

<span id="fn_1406"></span>[291:2](sbe0840.htm#fr_1411.md) Cf. *Kh*ândogya,
p. 627, and next note; and Gîtâ, inter alia, [p.
114](sbe0817.htm#page_114), and [p. 348](sbe0855.htm#page_348.md) infra.

<span id="fn_1407"></span>[291:3](sbe0840.htm#fr_1412.md) See
Sâ<u>n</u>khyatattvaktumudi, p. 7.

<span id="fn_1408"></span>[291:4](sbe0840.htm#fr_1413.md) I. e. a rule
expressly laid down. What is not visible means what is not expressly
stated, but is to be derived by inference, and so forth (cf. Âpastamba
I, 1, 4, 8). The express text is the famous one, 'Na himsyâtsarvâ
bhûtâni.' Hi*m*sâ, which is rendered slaughter here, may mean also
'giving pain' generally.

<span id="fn_1409"></span>[291:5](sbe0840.htm#fr_1414.md) This is the tu
quoque argument. The sustentation of life requires some sort of
slaughter.

<span id="fn_1410"></span>[291:6](sbe0840.htm#fr_1415.md) I. e. the support
of the body, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1411"></span>[292:1](sbe0840.htm#fr_1416.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
takes it otherwise, 'the true nature of the Sat, the self.' Nîlaka*nth*a
renders the original by sadrûpam without further explanation. This
indestructible seems to correspond to that mentioned at Gîtâ, [p.
113](sbe0817.htm#page_113.md), which should be considered in connection
with Gîtâ, pp. [73](sbe0808.htm#page_73), [74](sbe0809.htm#page_74.md). The
note at the former page is, perhaps, not quite accurately expressed, as
the word 'material cause' conveys some inadmissible associations.
Perhaps 'underlying principle' might be a nearer approach to the correct
idea. The existent will thus be that which really exists, as it is
indestructible.

<span id="fn_1412"></span>[292:2](sbe0840.htm#fr_1417.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
77](sbe0809.htm#page_77.md).

<span id="fn_1413"></span>[292:3](sbe0840.htm#fr_1418.md) See *S*ânti
Parvan (Moksha), ch. 240, st. 31.

<span id="fn_1414"></span>[292:4](sbe0840.htm#fr_1419.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says, 'The life-winds here are indicative of the operations of the
organs of action (as to which see [p. 290](#page_290.md), note
 [5](#fn_1404) supra.md), the tongue of the perceptive senses, the mind of
the internal activities, the quality of goodness of all sources of
pleasure, and passion of all sources of pain,' the last two apparently
covering the external world, the previous ones the human activities,
internal and external.

<span id="fn_1415"></span>[292:5](sbe0840.htm#fr_1420.md) Released scil.
from piety or impiety, &c.,--Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, who says 'Self' in the
phrase preceding means mind.

<span id="fn_1416"></span>[292:6](sbe0840.htm#fr_1421.md) Because, says
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, according to the very authority which says there is
sin in slaughter, all sin is destroyed by knowledge. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
64](sbe0807.htm#page_64.md).
