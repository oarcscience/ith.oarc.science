<P>Well then, I will declare to you what you ask of me, O best (of men)! Learn what a preceptor told a pupil who went to him. Hearing it all, deliberate on it properly. Non-destruction of all creatures, that is deemed to be the greatest duty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1961"></A><A HREF="#fn_1953"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. This is the highest seat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1962"></A><A HREF="#fn_1954"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, free from vexation and holy in character. The ancients who perceived the established (truth) call knowledge the highest happiness. Therefore by pure knowledge one is released from all sins. And those who are constantly engaged in destruction, and who are infidels&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1963"></A><A HREF="#fn_1955"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in their conduct, and who entertain avarice and delusion, go verily to hell. Those who without sloth perform actions with expectations, rejoice in this world, being born again and again. But those wise and talented men, who perform actions with faith, free from any connexion with expectations, perceive correctly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1964"></A><A HREF="#fn_1956"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Now I will proceed to, state how the association and dissociation of Kshetra<I>g</I>&ntilde;a and nature (take place). Learn that, O best (of men)! The relation here is said to be that between the object and subject&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1965"></A><A HREF="#fn_1957"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. The subject</P>

<P>is always the being, and nature is stated to be the object. It has been explained in the above mode, as (having the relation) of the gnat and the udumbara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1966"></A><A HREF="#fn_1958"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Nature which is non-intelligent knows nothing, though it is the object of enjoyment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1967"></A><A HREF="#fn_1959"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Who enjoys and what is enjoyed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1968"></A><A HREF="#fn_1960"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is learnt from the <I>S</I>&acirc;stras. Nature is said always to abound in the pairs of opposites, and to be constituted of the qualities; the Kshetra<I>g</I>&ntilde;a is free from the pairs of opposites, devoid of parts, and in essence free from the qualities. He abides in everything alike&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1969"></A><A HREF="#fn_1961"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and is connected with (all) knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1970"></A><A HREF="#fn_1962"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; and he always enjoys nature as a lotus-leaf (enjoys) water. Even brought into contact with all qualities, a learned man remains untainted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1971"></A><A HREF="#fn_1963"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. There is no doubt that the being is unattached just like the unsteady drop of water placed upon a lotus-leaf&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1972"></A><A HREF="#fn_1964"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>. It is established that nature is the property&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1973"></A><A HREF="#fn_1965"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> of the being. And the relation of the two is like that of matter and the maker&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1974"></A><A HREF="#fn_1966"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>. As one goes into (a) dark (place) taking a light (with him), so those who wish for the supreme go with the light of nature&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1975"></A><A HREF="#fn_1967"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>.

<P>and wick&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1976"></A><A HREF="#fn_1968"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the light shines; but the flame is extinguished when the oil and wick are exhausted. Thus nature is perceived&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1977"></A><A HREF="#fn_1969"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; the being is laid down (as being) unperceived. Understand this, O Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as! Well now, I will tell you something more. One who has a bad understanding does not acquire knowledge even with a thousand (admonitions). And one who is possessed of knowledge enhances (his) happiness even with a fourth share&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1978"></A><A HREF="#fn_1970"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Thus should one understand the accomplishment of piety by (apt) means. For the talented man who knows (these) means, attains supreme happiness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1979"></A><A HREF="#fn_1971"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. As a man travelling along some way without provisions for the journey, travels with great discomfort, and may even be destroyed on the way, so should one understand, that by action&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1980"></A><A HREF="#fn_1972"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> the fruit is or is not produced. For a man to see within (his) self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1981"></A><A HREF="#fn_1973"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> what is agreeable and what is disagreeable to him is good. And as one who is devoid of a perception of the truth rashly travels on foot by a long way unseen before&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1982"></A><A HREF="#fn_1974"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, while (another) goes by the same</P>

<P>way in a carriage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1983"></A><A HREF="#fn_1975"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> drawn by horses, and going swiftly, such is the progress of the men of understanding. Having climbed up a mountain one should not look at the surface of the earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1984"></A><A HREF="#fn_1976"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. One sees a man travelling in a chariot, and void of intelligence, afflicted by reason of the chariot. As far as there is a carriage-path, he goes in the carriage; where the carriage-path stops, a learned man goes on abandoning the carriage. So travels the talented man, who understands the procedure respecting (knowledge of the) truth and devotion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1985"></A><A HREF="#fn_1977"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and who knows about the qualities, comprehending the gradations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1986"></A><A HREF="#fn_1978"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> one above the other. As one who without a boat dives into the ocean with his arms only, through delusion, undoubtedly wishes for destruction; while a wise man likewise knowing distinctions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1987"></A><A HREF="#fn_1979"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and having a boat with good oars, goes in the water without fatigue, and soon crosses the reservoir, and having crossed (it) goes to the other shore, throwing</P>

<P>aside the boat, and devoid of (the thought that this or that is) mine. This has been already explained by the parallel of the carriage and pedestrian. One who has come by delusion through affection, adheres to that like a fisherman to his boat, being overcome by (the thought that this or that is) mine. It is not possible to move on land after embarking in a boat. And likewise one cannot move in water after entering a carriage. Thus there are various actions in regard to different objects&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1988"></A><A HREF="#fn_1980"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And as action is performed in this world, so does it result to them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1989"></A><A HREF="#fn_1981"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. That which sages by their understanding meditate upon, which is void of any smell whatever, void of taste, and void of colour, touch, or sound, that is called the Pradh&acirc;na&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1990"></A><A HREF="#fn_1982"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Now that Pradh&acirc;na is unperceived; a development of the unperceived is the Mahat; and a development of the Pradh&acirc;na (when it is) become Mahat is egoism. From egoism is produced the development, namely, the great elements; and of the elements respectively, objects of sense are verily stated to be the development&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1991"></A><A HREF="#fn_1983"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. The unperceived is of the nature of seed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1992"></A><A HREF="#fn_1984"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, and also productive in its essence. And we have heard</P>
<P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_383"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 383</FONT></A></P>
<P>that the great self is of the nature of seed and a product. Egoism is of the nature of seed and a product also again and again. And the five great elements are verily of the nature of seed and products. The objects of the five elements are of the nature of seed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1993"></A><A HREF="#fn_1985"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, but they do not yield products. Learn about their properties. Now space has one quality, air is said to have two qualities; it is said that light has three qualities; and water, too, is of four qualities; and earth, abounding with movables and immovables, the divine source of all entities, full of examples of agreeable and disagreeable (things), should be understood to be of five qualities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1994"></A><A HREF="#fn_1986"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Sound, touch, colour likewise, taste, and smell as the fifth--these, O best of the twice-born! should be understood to be the five qualities of earth. Smell always belongs to the earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1995"></A><A HREF="#fn_1987"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; and smell is stated to be (of) numerous descriptions. I will state at length the numerous qualities of smell&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1996"></A><A HREF="#fn_1988"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Smell is agreeable or disagreeable, sweet, sour, and bitter likewise, diffusive and compact also, soft, and rough, and clear also,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1997"></A><A HREF="#fn_1989"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>--thus should</P>

<P>smell, which belongs to the earth, be understood to be of ten descriptions. Sound, touch, and colour likewise, and taste, are stated to be the qualities of water. I will now give (some) information about taste. Taste is stated to be of numerous descriptions. Sweet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1998"></A><A HREF="#fn_1990"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, sour, bitter, sharp, astringent, and saltish likewise-thus are the forms of taste, which is a development of water, said to be of six descriptions. Sound, touch, and likewise colour; thus is light said to have three qualities. The quality of light is colour, and colour is stated to be of numerous descriptions. White, black, red likewise, green, yellow, and grey likewise, short long, narrow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1999"></A><A HREF="#fn_1991"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, broad, square, and circular-thus is the colour of light said to be of twelve forms. It should be understood&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2000"></A><A HREF="#fn_1992"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> by aged Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, who speak the truth, and are conversant with piety. Sound and touch also should be understood; air is said to have (these) two qualities. And touch is the quality of air, and touch is stated to be of numerous descriptions. Rough, cold and hot likewise, tender and clear also, hard, glutinous, smooth, slippery, hurtful, and soft&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2001"></A><A HREF="#fn_1993"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>--thus the quality of air is properly said by Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as who have reached perfection, who are conversant with piety and perceive the truth, to be of twelve descriptions. Now space has one quality,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_385"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 385</FONT></A></P>
<P>and that is stated to be sound only. I will speak at length of the numerous qualities of sound. Sha<I>dg</I>a, <I>Ri</I>shabha, together with G&acirc;ndh&acirc;ra, Madhyama, and likewise Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>ama, and beyond. these should be understood to be Nish&acirc;da and Dhaivata likewise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2002"></A><A HREF="sbe0863.htm#fn_1994"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; agreeable and disagreeable sound also, compact, and of (many) ingredients&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2003"></A><A HREF="sbe0863.htm#fn_1995"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Thus sound, which is produced in space, should be understood to be of ten descriptions. Space is the highest element&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2004"></A><A HREF="sbe0863.htm#fn_1996"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, egoism is above that; above egoism is understanding, and above that understanding is the self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2005"></A><A HREF="sbe0863.htm#fn_1997"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; above that is the unperceived, and above the unperceived is the being. One who knows which is superior and inferior among entities, and who knows the proper procedure in all actions, and who identifies himself with every being&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2006"></A><A HREF="sbe0863.htm#fn_1998"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, repairs to the imperishable self.</P>

R&acirc;m&acirc;nu<I>g</I>a, whose commentary came to hand too late for any other than a very occasional use in the translation of the G&icirc;t&acirc;, renders it by 'belief in the truth of the teaching of the Vedas'.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1957"></A><A HREF="sbe0862.htm#fr_1965">378:5</A> I use the terms subject and object here in the philosophical sense explained by Sir W.

The relation is one of close connexion, coupled with some identity of nature (because, says N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, an entirely extraneous thing could not get into the inside of the fruit, and the gnat's body therefore must have come from the fruit itself), but still the elements are distinct.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1984"></A><A HREF="sbe0862.htm#fr_1992">382:5</A> The meaning of this passage seems to be identical with that of S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-k&acirc;rik&acirc; 3. Productive (Prasav&acirc;tmakam) is probably to be explained as Prasavadharmi is at S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-k&acirc;rik&acirc; II (see commentary of V&acirc;<I>k</I>aspati, pp. 59, 60), viz. always undergoing development. The great elements are of course the tanm&acirc;tras.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1985"></A><A HREF="sbe0862.htm#fr_1993">383:1</A> This is not clear, unless 'product' above means productive, and seed means a product, it being a product of the a<U>n</U>kura or sprout. N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a says, 'seed = cause; product = effect. The unperceived is an effect, and so the contrary doctrine of the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya is here shown to be wrong. The objects are causes, as their enjoyment causes an impression.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1992"></A><A HREF="sbe0862.htm#fr_2000">384:3</A> Sic. Does it mean 'it is understood?' Cf. P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini III, 3, 113.</P>

The enumeration of these in the <I>S</I>&acirc;nti Parvan loc. cit. is again different.</P>
