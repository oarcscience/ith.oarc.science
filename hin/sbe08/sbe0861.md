# CHAPTER XXXIV.

The sages said:

Which (form of) piety is deemed to be the most worthy of being
performed? We observe the various modes of piety to be as it were
contradictory. Some say (it <span id="fr_1947"></span>[1](#fn_1939.md)
remains) after the body (is destroyed); some say that is not so. Some
(say) everything <span id="fr_1948"></span>[2](#fn_1940.md) is doubtful;
and others that there is no doubt. Some say the permanent (principle) is
impermanent, and others, too, that it exists, and (others) that it
exists not <span id="fr_1949"></span>[3](#fn_1941). Some (say it is.md) of
one form or twofold, and others (that it is) mixed <span
id="fr_1950"></span>[4](#fn_1942.md). Some Brâhma*n*as, too, who know the
Brahman and perceive the truth, believe it to be one; others distinct;
and others again (that it is) manifold <span
id="fr_1951"></span>[5](#fn_1943.md). Some say both time and space
(exist) <span id="fr_1952"></span>[6](#fn_1944.md), and others that that is
not so. Some have matted hair and skins; and some (are) clean-shaven and
without covering. Some people are for bathing; some for the
omission <span id="fr_1953"></span>[7](#fn_1945.md) of bathing. Some are
for taking food; others are intent on fasting. Some people extol action,
and

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

others tranquillity. Some extol final emancipation; some various kinds
of enjoyments; some wish for riches, and others indigence. Some (say)
means <span id="fr_1954"></span>[1](#fn_1946.md) should be resorted to;
others that that is not so. Some are devoted to harmlessness, and some
given up to destruction; some are for merit and glory; and others say
that is not so. Some are devoted to goodness; some are in the midst of
doubts; some are for pleasure, and some for pain <span
id="fr_1955"></span>[2](#fn_1947). Some people (say.md) meditation <span
id="fr_1956"></span>[3](#fn_1948), other Brâhma*n*as (say.md) sacrifice,
and others, gifts; but others extol penance, and other persons sacred
study; some knowledge, and renunciation <span
id="fr_1957"></span>[4](#fn_1949.md); and those who ponder on the
element <span id="fr_1958"></span>[5](#fn_1950.md), nature <span
id="fr_1959"></span>[6](#fn_1951.md). Some extol everything, and others
nothing <span id="fr_1960"></span>[7](#fn_1952.md).

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

\[paragraph continues\] And, O best of the gods! piety being thus
confused and abounding in contradictions, we are deluded, and come to no
determination. People are acting, (saying) this is good, this is good.
And he who is attached to a certain (form of) piety, always esteems
that. Here (therefore) our understanding breaks down, and our mind is
distracted. We wish, O best (of beings)! to be informed of what is good.
Be pleased now to proceed to state what is (so) mysterious, and what is
the cause of the connexion between the Kshetra*g*ña and nature. Thus
addressed by those Brâhma*n*as, the venerable, holy, and talented
creator of worlds told them accurately (what they asked).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1939"></span>[375:1](sbe0861.htm#fr_1947.md) I. e. the piety,
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra,; the self, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1940"></span>[375:2](sbe0861.htm#fr_1948.md) I. e. such as
piety, &c., Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1941"></span>[375:3](sbe0861.htm#fr_1949.md) follow Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra, who says 'permanent' means soul, &c. The correct expression
would seem to be 'that which is called permanent by others is
impermanent.'

<span id="fn_1942"></span>[375:4](sbe0861.htm#fr_1950.md) This is the view
of those who hold the theory of Pari*n*âma, or development, says
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1943"></span>[375:5](sbe0861.htm#fr_1951.md) 'To be one' =
knowledge to be all of one description, 'distinct' = knowledge having
various entities for its distinct objects (this is the view of the
holders of the Vi*g*ñânavâda, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra); manifold = that
the selfs are numberless. The words here are nearly identical with those
at Gîtâ, [p. 83](sbe0811.htm#page_83), see note  [4](sbe0811.htm#fn_323.md)
there.

<span id="fn_1944"></span>[375:6](sbe0861.htm#fr_1952.md) I. e. help in
action, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1945"></span>[375:7](sbe0861.htm#fr_1953.md) See Âpastamba I,
1, 1, 2 (comment).

<span id="fn_1946"></span>[376:1](sbe0861.htm#fr_1954.md) I. e. for the
acquisition of anything desirable, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, who adds, 'by those
who wish for piety.' Nîlaka*nth*a says means = 'meditation and so
forth;' as to 'that is not so' he cites what he calls a *S*ruti, which
is however one of the Kârikâs of Gau*d*apâda on the Mâ*nd*ukya; see p.
432.

<span id="fn_1947"></span>[376:2](sbe0861.htm#fr_1955.md) This, too, is not
quite clear, but Nîlaka*nth*a says, 'meditation should be practised for
release from pain, and for acquisition of pleasure;' land others say not
so, it should be done without desire.'

<span id="fn_1948"></span>[376:3](sbe0861.htm#fr_1956.md) That is to say,
they hold that meditation should be practised.

<span id="fn_1949"></span>[376:4](sbe0861.htm#fr_1957.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
seems to take this to mean 'renunciation of knowledge,' i.e. a blank,
and says this was the view of the Mâdhyamikas,--I suppose the Mâdhyamika
Bauddhas.

<span id="fn_1950"></span>[376:5](sbe0861.htm#fr_1958.md) I. e. the
*K*ârvâkas, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1951"></span>[376:6](sbe0861.htm#fr_1959.md) *S*vetâ*s*vatara,
p. 276, and *S*a<u>n</u>kara's commentary there.

<span id="fn_1952"></span>[376:7](sbe0861.htm#fr_1960.md) Were there
optimists. and pessimists at the time of the Anugîtâ in India? This
verse, however, does not occur in some MSS. Nîlaka*nth*a's note on this
passage may be of some interest. He says, 'Some hold that the self
exists after the body is lost; others, that is the Lokâyatas or
*K*ârvâkas, hold the contrary. Everything doubtful is the view of the
Syâdvâdins; nothing doubtful that of the Tairthikas, the great teachers
(I presume, about their own respective doctrines). Everything
impermanent, Târkikas; permanent, Mîmâ*m*sakas; nothing exists, the
*S*ûnyavâdins; something exists, but only momentarily, <span
id="page_377">p. 377</span> Saugatas; knowledge is one, but the ego and
non-ego are two different principles, the Yogâ*k*âras; mixed,
U*d*ulomas; one, is the view of the worshippers of the Brahman as
possessed of qualities; distinct, other Mîmâ*m*sakas, who hold that the
special actions are the cause (of everything, is meant, I presume);
manifold = the atomists; time and space = astrologers. Those who "say
that is not so," that is to say, that what we see has no real existence
at all, are the V*ri*ddhas, ancient philosophers; omission to bathe =
the condition of Naish*th*ika Brahma*k*ârins; bathing = householder's
condition; "means should be resorted to, that is not so," those who are
against all meditation, &c., according to the *S*ruti text, which
Nîlaka*nth*a quotes; "merit and glory, that is not so," some say there
is no merit as the Lokâyatas or *K*ârvâkas; "knowledge, renunciation,"
the former is to be gained only by means of the latter; "ponder on
elements" = who are intent on the investigation of the true nature of
things; nature = abundance of resources, by which alone knowledge is
produced, not by mere renunciation.' It will be understood, that this
commentary assumes a different syntactical construction of the original
in some places from that adopted in our translation.
