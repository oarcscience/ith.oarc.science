# CHAPTER XIV.

The Deity said:

Again I will declare (to you) the highest knowledge, the best of (all
sorts of) knowledge, having

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

learnt which, all sages have reached perfection beyond (the bonds of)
this (body). Those who, resorting to this knowledge, reach assimilation
with my essence, are not born at the creation, and are not
afflicted <span id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_444.md) at the destruction (of
the universe). The great Brahman <span id="fr_446"></span>[2](#fn_445.md)
is a womb for me, in which I cast the seed. From that, O descendant of
Bharata! is the birth of all things. Of the bodies, O son of Kuntî!
which are born from all wombs, the (main) womb is the great Brahman, and
I (am) the father, the giver of the seed. Goodness, passion, darkness,
these qualities <span id="fr_447"></span>[3](#fn_446.md) born from nature,
O you of mighty arms! bind down the inexhaustible soul in the body. Of
these, goodness, which, in consequence of being untainted, is
enlightening and free from (all) misery, binds the soul, O sinless one!
with the bond of pleasure and the bond of knowledge <span
id="fr_448"></span>[4](#fn_447.md). Know that passion consists in being
enamoured, and is produced from craving and attachment. That, O son of
Kuntî! binds down the embodied (self) with the

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

bond of action. Darkness (you must) know to be born of ignorance, it
deludes all embodied (selfs). And that, O descendant of Bharata! binds
down (the self) with heedlessness <span id="fr_449"></span>[1](#fn_448.md),
indolence, and sleep. Goodness unites (the self) with pleasure; passion,
O descendant of Bharata! with action; and darkness with heedlessness,
after shrouding up knowledge. Passion and darkness being repressed,
goodness stands, O descendant of Bharata! Passion and goodness (being
repressed), darkness; and likewise darkness and goodness (being
repressed), passion <span id="fr_450"></span>[2](#fn_449.md). When in this
body at all portals <span id="fr_451"></span>[3](#fn_450.md) light (that is
to say) knowledge prevails, then should one know goodness to be
developed. Avarice, activity <span id="fr_452"></span>[4](#fn_451.md),
performance of actions, want of tranquillity, desire, these are
produced, O chief of the descendants of Bharata! when passion is
developed. Want of light, want of activity <span
id="fr_453"></span>[5](#fn_452.md), heedlessness, and delusion, these are
produced, O descendant of Kuru! when darkness is developed. When an
embodied (self) encounters death, while goodness is developed, then he
reaches the untainted worlds of those who know the highest <span
id="fr_454"></span>[6](#fn_453.md). Encountering death during (the
prevalence

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

of) passion, he is born among those attached to action. Likewise, dying
during (the prevalence of) darkness, he is born in the wombs of the
ignorant <span id="fr_455"></span>[1](#fn_454.md). The fruit of meritorious
action is said to be good, untainted; while the fruit of passion is
misery; and the fruit of darkness ignorance. From goodness is produced
knowledge, from passion avarice <span id="fr_456"></span>[2](#fn_455.md),
and from darkness heedlessness and delusion and ignorance also. Those
who adhere to (the ways of) goodness go up <span
id="fr_457"></span>[3](#fn_456.md); the passionate remain in the middle;
while those of the qualities of darkness, adhering to the ways of the
lowest quality, go down. When a right-seeing person sees none but the
qualities (to be) the doers (of all action), and knows what is above the
qualities <span id="fr_458"></span>[4](#fn_457.md), he enters into my
essence. The embodied (self), who transcends these three qualities, from
which bodies are produced <span id="fr_459"></span>[5](#fn_458.md), attains
immortality, being freed from birth and death and old age and misery.

Ar*g*una said:

What are the characteristics, O lord! of one who has transcended these
three qualities? What is his conduct, and how does he transcend these
three qualities <span id="fr_460"></span>[6](#fn_459.md)?

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

The Deity said:

He is said to have transcended the qualities, O son of Pându! who is not
averse to light and activity and delusion (when they) prevail, and who
does not desire (them when they) cease <span
id="fr_461"></span>[1](#fn_460.md); who sitting like one unconcerned is
never perturbed by the qualities <span id="fr_462"></span>[2](#fn_461.md);
who remains steady and moves <span id="fr_463"></span>[3](#fn_462.md) not,
(thinking) merely that the qualities <span
id="fr_464"></span>[4](#fn_463.md) exist; who is self-contained <span
id="fr_465"></span>[5](#fn_464.md); to whom pain and pleasure are alike; to
whom a sod and a stone and gold are alike; to whom what is agreeable and
what is disagreeable are alike; who has discernment; to whom censure and
praise of himself are alike; who is alike in honour and dishonour; who
is alike towards the sides of friends and foes; and who abandons all
action <span id="fr_466"></span>[6](#fn_465.md). And he who worships me
with an unswerving devotion, transcends these qualities, and becomes fit
for (entrance into) the essence of the Brahman. For I am the embodiment
of the Brahman <span id="fr_467"></span>[7](#fn_466.md), of indefeasible
immortality, of eternal piety, and of unbroken happiness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_441"></span>[106:1](sbe0815.htm#fr_442.md) Not to have true
knowledge, is equivalent to self-destruction. Cf. Î*s*opanishad, pp. 9,
15, 16.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[106:2](sbe0815.htm#fr_443.md) I. e. absorbed at
the time of the deluge in nature, one of the energies of the supreme;
'emanating,' i.e. at the time of creation.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[106:3](sbe0815.htm#fr_444.md) Nature, which is
the material cause from which all entities are produced; the destruction
of it results from true knowledge of the soul. See the third note on [p.
107](#page_107.md) infra.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[107:1](sbe0816.htm#fr_445.md) I. e. 'are not
destroyed,' Madhusûdana; 'do not fall,' *S*a<u>n</u>kara; are not born,'
*S*rîdhara, and apparently Râmânu*g*a.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[107:2](sbe0816.htm#fr_446.md) I. e. the 'nature'
spoken of before.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[107:3](sbe0816.htm#fr_447.md) These constitute
nature. We must understand nature, with Professor Bhâ*nd*ârkar, as the
hypothetical cause of the soul's feeling itself limited and conditioned.
If nature is understood, as it usually is, to mean matter, its being
made up of the qualities is inexplicable. Interpreted idealistically, as
suggested by Professor Bhâ*nd*ârkar, the destruction of it spoken of at
the close of the last chapter also becomes intelligible. By means of
knowledge of the soul, the unreality of these manifestations is
understood and nature is destroyed.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[107:4](sbe0816.htm#fr_448.md) Pleasure and
knowledge appertain to the mind, not the self, hence they are described
as constituting bonds, when erroneously connected with the self,
*S*a<u>n</u>kara and *S*rîdhara. They constitute 'bonds,' because the
self when brought into contact with them, strives to obtain them,
Râmânu*g*a.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[108:1](sbe0816.htm#fr_449.md) Carelessness about
duty, owing to being intent on something else. Cf. Sutta Nipâta, pp.
51-91; Dhammapada. stanza 21; Ka*th*opanishad, p. 152.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[108:2](sbe0816.htm#fr_450.md) The effects of each
quality assert themselves, when the other two are held in check.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[108:3](sbe0816.htm#fr_451.md) I. e. the senses of
perception.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[108:4](sbe0816.htm#fr_452.md) Activity = always
doing something or another; performance, &c. = rearing large mansions,
&c. want of tranquillity = perpetual agitation of mind, 'this I will do
now, then, that, and next the other;' desire = to obtain everything that
one comes across.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[108:5](sbe0816.htm#fr_453.md) I. e. doing
absolutely nothing.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[108:6](sbe0816.htm#fr_454.md) The highest
manifestations of Brahman, viz. the Hira*n*yagarbha, &c., say *S*rîdhara
and Madhusûdana. Nîlaka*nth*a also suggests that 'those who know the
highest' means gods.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[109:1](sbe0816.htm#fr_455.md) Lower creation,
such as birds, beasts, &c.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[109:2](sbe0816.htm#fr_456.md) Cf. Sutta Nipâta,
p. 16.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[109:3](sbe0816.htm#fr_457.md) I. e. are born as
gods, &c., middle,' as men, &c.; 'down,' as brutes, &c.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[109:4](sbe0816.htm#fr_458.md) I. e. what has been
called Kshetragña before, the supervising principle within one.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[109:5](sbe0816.htm#fr_459.md) Bodies are
developments of the qualities, say the commentators, which is not
incompatible with the explanation of qualities given above. As to
transcending qualities, cf. [p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48.md) supra.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[109:6](sbe0816.htm#fr_460.md) Cf. as to what
follows what is said in chapter II about 'one whose mind is steady.'

<span id="fn_460"></span>[110:1](sbe0816.htm#fr_461.md) I. e. who does not
feel troubled, for instance, thinking now I am actuated by a motive of
passion or darkness, and so forth.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[110:2](sbe0816.htm#fr_462.md) So as to lose all
discrimination.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[110:3](sbe0816.htm#fr_463.md) I. e. from his
determination to pursue truth, by worldly pleasures or pains.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[110:4](sbe0816.htm#fr_464.md) Cf. [p.
55](sbe0805.htm#page_55.md) supra.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[110:5](sbe0816.htm#fr_465.md) Intent on the self
only.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[110:6](sbe0816.htm#fr_466.md) For the whole
passage, cf. [p. 101](sbe0814.htm#page_101.md) supra.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[110:7](sbe0816.htm#fr_467.md) Nîlaka*nth*a
interprets this to mean 'the ultimate object of the Vedas.' I here
K*ri*sh*n*a. *S*rîdhara suggests this parallel, as light embodied is the
sun, so is the Brahman embodied identical with Vâsudeva.
