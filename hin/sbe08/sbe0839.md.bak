# CHAPTER XII.

The Brâhma*n*a said:

I have crossed beyond that very impassable place, in which fancies are
the gadflies and mosquitoes <span id="fr_1368"></span>[3](#fn_1363.md), in
which grief and joy are cold and heat, in which delusion is the blinding
darkness, in which avarice is the beasts of prey and reptiles, in which
desire and anger are the obstructors, the way to which consists in
worldly objects, and is to be crossed by one singly <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[4](#fn_1364.md). And I have entered the great
forest <span id="fr_1370"></span>[5](#fn_1365.md).

The Brâhma*n*a's wife said:

Where is that forest, O very intelligent person! what are the trees
(there), and what the rivers, and the hills and mountains; and at what
distance is that forest?

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

The Brâhma*n*a said:

There is nothing else more delightful than that, when there is no
distinction from it. There is nothing more afflicting than that, when
there is a distinction from it <span id="fr_1371"></span>[1](#fn_1366.md).
There is nothing smaller than that, there is nothing larger than
that <span id="fr_1372"></span>[2](#fn_1367.md). There is nothing more
subtle than that; there is no other happiness equal to, that. Entering
it, the twice-born do not grieve, and do not exult <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[3](#fn_1368.md). They are not afraid of anybody, and
nobody is afraid of them. In that forest <span
id="fr_1374"></span>[4](#fn_1369.md) are seven large trees <span
id="fr_1375"></span>[5](#fn_1370.md), seven fruits, and seven guests; seven
hermitages, seven (forms of) concentration, and seven (forms of)
initiation. This is the description of the forest. That forest is filled
with trees producing splendid flowers and fruits of five colours <span
id="fr_1376"></span>[6](#fn_1371.md). That forest

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

is filled with trees producing flowers and fruits of four colours. That
forest is filled with trees producing flowers and fruits of three
colours, and mixed. That forest is filled with trees producing flowers
and fruits of two colours, and of beautiful colours. That forest is
filled with trees producing flowers and fruits of one colour, and
fragrant. That forest is filled with two large trees producing numerous
flowers and fruits of undistinguished colours <span
id="fr_1377"></span>[1](#fn_1372.md). There is one fire <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[2](#fn_1373.md) here, connected with the Brahman <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[3](#fn_1374.md), and having a good mind <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[4](#fn_1375). And there is fuel here, (namely.md) the
five senses. The seven (forms of) emancipation from them are the seven
(forms of) initiation <span id="fr_1381"></span>[5](#fn_1376.md). The
qualities are the fruits, and the guests eat the fruits. There, in
various places, the great sages receive hospitality. And when they have
been worshipped and have disappeared <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[6](#fn_1377.md), another forest shines forth, in which
intelligence is the tree, and emancipation the fruit, and which
possesses shade (in the form of) tranquillity,

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

which depends on knowledge, which has contentment for its water, and
which has the Kshetra*g*ña within for the sun. The good who attain to
that, have no fear afterwards. Its end cannot be perceived upwards or
downwards or horizontally <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1](#fn_1378.md). There
always dwell seven females there <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[2](#fn_1379), with faces (turned.md) downwards, full
of brilliance, and causes of generation. They absorb <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[3](#fn_1380.md) all the higher delights of people, as
inconstancy (absorbs) everything <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[4](#fn_1381.md). In that same <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[5](#fn_1382) (principle.md) the seven perfect sages,
together with their chiefs, the richest <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[6](#fn_1383.md), abide, and again emerge from the
same. Glory; brilliance, and greatness, enlightenment, victory,
perfection, and power <span id="fr_1389"></span>[7](#fn_1384.md)--these
seven rays follow after this same sun. Hills and mountains also are
there collected together, and rivers and streams flowing with water
produced from the Brahman <span id="fr_1390"></span>[8](#fn_1385.md). And
there is the confluence of the rivers in the secluded place <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[9](#fn_1386.md) for the

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

sacrifice, whence those who are contented in their own selfs repair to
the divine grandsire himself. Those whose wishes are reduced <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[1](sbe0840.htm#fn_1387), whose wishes are (fixed.md)
on good vows, whose sins are burnt up by penance, merging the self in
the self <span id="fr_1393"></span>[2](sbe0840.htm#fn_1388.md), devote
themselves to Brahman. Those people who understand the forest of
knowledge <span id="fr_1394"></span>[3](sbe0840.htm#fn_1389.md), praise
tranquillity. And aspiring to that forest, they are born so as not to
lose courage <span id="fr_1395"></span>[4](sbe0840.htm#fn_1390.md). Such,
indeed, is this holy forest, as understood by Brâhma*n*as. And
understanding it, they act (accordingly), being directed by the
Kshetra*g*ña.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1361"></span>[284:1](sbe0838.htm#fr_1366.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
61](sbe0806.htm#page_61.md). The water is that required for the sacrifice.
The words 'the Brahman is his origin' are not quite clear, as being not
connected with the figure employed. Perhaps it might be taken otherwise
thus, 'the Brahman (is) the fire produced from the Brahman,' this last
standing for the ara*n*i.

<span id="fn_1362"></span>[284:2](sbe0838.htm#fr_1367.md) I. e. one who
understands the truth, Nîlaka*nth*a; God, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. The same
sentence winds up two of the following chapters; and at [p.
310](sbe0846.htm#page_310.md) K*ri*sh*n*a says the Kshetra*g*ña signifies
the supreme self. See Gîtâ, [p. 102](sbe0814.htm#page_102.md) seq.

<span id="fn_1363"></span>[284:3](sbe0839.htm#fr_1368.md) Cf. Lalita
Vistara, p. 44.

<span id="fn_1364"></span>[284:4](sbe0839.htm#fr_1369.md) I. e. not with
the help of son, wealth, &c., says Nîlaka*nth*a, as each man's salvation
after having got into the course of worldly life depends on himself. Cf.
*S*ânti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 193, st. 32, and Manu IV, 240;
obstructor, thief, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1365"></span>[284:5](sbe0839.htm#fr_1370.md) I. e. the
Brahman. Nîlaka*nth*a compares a text from the *S*ruti, 'Kim svid
vana*m* ka u sa v*ri*ksha âsa;' see Rig-veda X, 31, 7.

<span id="fn_1366"></span>[285:1](sbe0839.htm#fr_1371.md) Cf. *Kh*ândogya,
pp. 516, 517.

<span id="fn_1367"></span>[285:2](sbe0839.htm#fr_1372.md) Cf.
Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p. 180](sbe0825.htm#page_180.md) and note there.

<span id="fn_1368"></span>[285:3](sbe0839.htm#fr_1373.md) Cf. as to all
this Gîtâ, [p. 101](sbe0814.htm#page_101.md).

<span id="fn_1369"></span>[285:4](sbe0839.htm#fr_1374.md) This is not the
forest spoken of before. but what has been before called the 'impassable
place,' but which also at [p. 286](#page_286.md) is by implication called a
forest, viz. the course of worldly life.

<span id="fn_1370"></span>[285:5](sbe0839.htm#fr_1375.md) Viz. the eye,
ear, tongue, skin, and nose, and the mind, and understanding--these are
called trees, as being producers of the fruits, namely, the pleasures
and pains derived from their several operations; the guests are the
powers of each sense personified--they receive the fruits above
described; the hermitages are the trees above mentioned, in which the
guests take shelter; the seven forms of concentration are the exclusion
from the self of the seven functions of the seven senses &c. already
referred to; the seven forms of initiation refer to the initiation into
the higher life, by repudiating as not one's own the actions of each
member out of the group of seven. Cf. as to this *Kh*ândogya, p. 219,
and commentary there.

<span id="fn_1371"></span>[285:6](sbe0839.htm#fr_1376.md) Cf. for these
different numbers of colours, Yoga-sûtra II, 19, and commentary, p. 105,
and *S*â<u>n</u>khya-sâra, p. 18. The trees here meant are the
Tanmâtras, or subtle elements, and the theory is that the
Gandha-tanmâtra, or subtle element of smell, has five qualities, its
<span id="page_286">p. 286</span> own special one, so to say, and the
four special ones of the others; the next is taste, the next colour, the
next touch, and the last sound; each has one quality less than its
predecessor. See Yoga-sûtra, p. 106, and gloss; *S*â<u>n</u>khya-sûtra
I, 62; and Vedânta Paribhâshâ, p. 45.

<span id="fn_1372"></span>[286:1](sbe0839.htm#fr_1377.md) These are mind
and understanding; the fruits and flowers are here of 'undistinguished
colours,' as the text expresses it, since they include the colours of
all the fruits of all the other five sets of trees; that is to say, the
subject-matter of their operations is sound, taste, &c., the
subject-matters of all the senses together. 'Undistinguished colours'
is, perhaps, more literally 'of colours not clear.' Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
paraphrases it by 'of variegated colours,' which is no doubt the true
ultimate sense.

<span id="fn_1373"></span>[286:2](sbe0839.htm#fr_1378.md) The self,
Nîlaka*nth*a. See [p. 279](sbe0837.htm#page_279.md), note
 [7](sbe0837.htm#fn_1336.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1374"></span>[286:3](sbe0839.htm#fr_1379.md) I. e., I presume,
devoted to the Brahman.

<span id="fn_1375"></span>[286:4](sbe0839.htm#fr_1380.md) I. e. true
knowledge, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1376"></span>[286:5](sbe0839.htm#fr_1381.md) See note
 [5](#fn_1370), [p. 285](#page_285.md).

<span id="fn_1377"></span>[286:6](sbe0839.htm#fr_1382.md) I. e. when the
senses having worked, as unconnected with the self, are finally absorbed
into it. Cf. *S*â<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ 49 and Ka*th*a, p. 151.

<span id="fn_1378"></span>[287:1](sbe0839.htm#fr_1383.md) It extends on all
sides, its end cannot be perceived on any side.

<span id="fn_1379"></span>[287:2](sbe0839.htm#fr_1384.md) These are,
according to Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, the Mahat, Aha<u>n</u>kâra, and five
Tanmâtras. Their faces are turned downwards, as they are obstacles in
the way upwards, viz. the way of final emancipation; they are brilliant,
as they light up the course of worldly life; and hence, too, they are
'causes of generation.' They give birth to the universe.

<span id="fn_1380"></span>[287:3](sbe0839.htm#fr_1385.md) They conceal the
higher delight of final emancipation.

<span id="fn_1381"></span>[287:4](sbe0839.htm#fr_1386.md) I follow Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra, but the text is doubtful.

<span id="fn_1382"></span>[287:5](sbe0839.htm#fr_1387.md) Viz. the Brahman.

<span id="fn_1383"></span>[287:6](sbe0839.htm#fr_1388.md) Cf. *Kh*ândogya,
pp. 295-300. The word sages here, as before, means the various organs.
See B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 415.

<span id="fn_1384"></span>[287:7](sbe0839.htm#fr_1389.md) Glory = renown;
brilliance = Brahmic splendour (Brahmate*g*as); perfection = obtaining
what is desired; power = not being conquered by others, Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra. About the sun, see line 3 of text above.

<span id="fn_1385"></span>[287:8](sbe0839.htm#fr_1390.md) I. e.
contentment. See the second line in the text above.

<span id="fn_1386"></span>[287:9](sbe0839.htm#fr_1391.md) I. e. the space
in the heart, the sacrifice being that of 'concentration of mind,'
yogaya*g*ña,--Nîlaka*nth*a. A confluence of rivers is very sacred--here
the meaning intended seems to be the absorption of all desires by
contentment into the heart.
