# CHAPTER XVII.

Ar*g*una said:

What is the state of those, O K*ri*sh*n*a! who worship with faith, (but)
abandoning scripture ordinances--goodness, passion, or darkness?

The Deity said:

Faith is of three kinds in embodied (beings), it is produced from
dispositions <span id="fr_507"></span>[4](#fn_504.md). It is of the quality
of goodness, of the quality of passion, and of the quality of darkness.
Hear about it. The faith of all, O descendant of Bharata! is conformable
to the

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

heart <span id="fr_508"></span>[1](#fn_505.md). A being here is full of
faith, and whatever is a man's faith, that is a man himself <span
id="fr_509"></span>[2](#fn_506.md). Those of the quality of goodness
worship the gods; those of the quality of passion the Yakshas and
Rakshases <span id="fr_510"></span>[3](#fn_507.md); and the others, the
people of the quality of darkness, worship departed (spirits) and the
multitudes of Bhûtas. Know those to be of demoniac convictions, who
practise fierce penance <span id="fr_511"></span>[4](#fn_508.md) not
ordained by scripture; who are full of ostentatiousness and egoism, and
of desire, attachment, and stubbornness; who are without discernment;
and who torment the groups of organs in (their) bodies, and me also
seated within (those) bodies. The food also, which is liked by all, and
likewise the sacrifice, the penance, and gifts, are of three kinds.
Listen to the distinctions regarding them as follows. The kinds of food
which increase life, energy, strength, health, comfort, and relish,
which are savoury, oleaginous, full of nutrition, and agreeable, are
liked by the good. The kinds of food which are bitter, acid, saltish,
too hot, sharp, rough, and. burning, and which cause pain. grief, and
disease, are desired by the passionate. And the food <span
id="fr_512"></span>[5](#fn_509.md) which is cold, tasteless, stinking,
stale, impure, and even leavings, are liked by the dark. That sacrifice
is good which, being prescribed in (scripture) ordinances, is performed
by persons

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

not wishing for the fruit (of it), and after determining (in their) mind
that the sacrifice must needs be performed. But when a sacrifice is
performed, O highest of the descendants of Bharata! with an expectation
of fruit (from it), and for the purpose of ostentation, know that
sacrifice (to be) passionate. They call that sacrifice dark, which is
against the ordinances (of scripture), in which no food is dealt out (to
Brâhma*n*as, &c.), which is devoid of Mantras <span
id="fr_513"></span>[1](#fn_510.md), devoid of Dakshi*n*â presents, and
which is without faith. Paying reverence to gods, Brâhma*n*as,
preceptors, and men of knowledge; purity <span
id="fr_514"></span>[2](#fn_511.md), straightforwardness, life as
Brahma*k*ârin, and harmlessness, (this) is called the penance bodily.
The speech which causes no sorrow, which is true, agreeable, and
beneficial, and the study <span id="fr_515"></span>[3](#fn_512.md) of the
Vedas, (this) is called the penance vocal. Calmness of mind, mildness,
taciturnity <span id="fr_516"></span>[4](#fn_513.md), self-restraint, and
purity of heart, this is called the penance mental. This threefold
penance, practised with perfect faith, by men who do not wish for the
fruit, and who are possessed of devotion is called good. The penance
which is done for respect, honour, and reverence <span
id="fr_517"></span>[5](#fn_514.md), and with ostentatiousness,

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

and which is uncertain and transient <span
id="fr_518"></span>[1](#fn_515.md), is here called passionate. And that
penance is described as dark, which is performed under a misguided
conviction, with pain to oneself, or for the destruction of another.
That gift is said (to be) good, which is given, because it ought to be
given, to one who (can) do no service (in return), at a (proper) place
and time, an d to a (proper) person. But that gift which is given with
much difficulty, for a return of services, or even with an expectation
of fruit <span id="fr_519"></span>[2](#fn_516.md), is said to be
passionate. And that gift, is described as dark, which is given to unfit
persons, at an unfit place and time, without respect, and with contempt.
Om, Tad, and Sat, this is said (to be) the threefold designation of the
Brahman. By that <span id="fr_520"></span>[3](#fn_517.md), the Brâhma*n*as
and the Vedas and sacrifices were created in olden times. Hence, the
performance by those who study the Brahman, of sacrifices, gifts, and
penances, prescribed by the ordinances (of scripture), always commence
after saying 'Om <span id="fr_521"></span>[4](#fn_518.md).' Those who
desire final emancipation perform the various acts of sacrifice and
penance, and the various acts of gift, without expectation of fruit,
after (saying) 'Tad <span id="fr_522"></span>[5](#fn_519.md).' 'Sat' is
employed to express existence and goodness; and likewise, O son of
P*ri*thâ! the word 'Sat' is used to express an auspicious act. Constancy
in

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

(making) sacrifices. penances, and gifts, is called 'Sat;' and (all)
action, too, of which that <span
id="fr_523"></span>[1](sbe0820.htm#fn_520.md) is the object, is also called
'Sat.' Whatever oblation is offered, whatever is given, whatever penance
is performed, and whatever is done, without faith <span
id="fr_524"></span>[2](sbe0820.htm#fn_521.md), that, O son of P*ri*thâ! is
called 'Asat,' and that is nought, both after death and here <span
id="fr_525"></span>[3](sbe0820.htm#fn_522.md).
