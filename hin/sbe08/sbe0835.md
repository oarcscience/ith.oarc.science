# CHAPTER VIII.

The Brâhma*n*a said:

On this, too, they relate an ancient story, O beautiful one! (showing)
of what description is the institution of the five sacrificial priests.
The learned know this to be a great principle, that the Prâ*n*a and the
Apâna, and the Udâna, and also the Samâna and the Vyâna, are the five
sacrificial priests.

The Brâhma*n*a's wife said:

My former belief was that the sacrificial priests were seven. by (their)
nature <span id="fr_1299"></span>[4](#fn_1294). State how the great
principle is that there are verily five sacrificial priests <span
id="fr_1300"></span>[5](#fn_1295).

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

The Brâhma*n*a said:

The wind prepared by the Prâ*n*a afterwards becomes the Apâna. The wind
prepared in the Apâna then works as the Vyâna. The wind prepared by the
Vyâna works as the Udâna. And the wind prepared in the Udâna is produced
as Samâna <span id="fr_1301"></span>[1](#fn_1296). They formerly went to
the grandsire, who was born first, and said to him, 'Tell us which is
greatest among us. He shall be the greatest among us <span
id="fr_1302"></span>[2](#fn_1297).'

Brahman said:

He, verily, is the greatest, who being extinct, all the life-winds in
the body of living creatures become extinct; and on whose moving about,
they again move about. (Now) go where (you) like.

The Prâ*n*a said:

When I am extinct, all the life-winds in the body

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

of living creatures become extinct; and on my moving about, they again
move about. I am the greatest. See I am extinct!

The Brâhma*n*a said:

Then the Prâ*n*a became extinct, and again moved about. Then the Samâna
and Udâna also <span id="fr_1303"></span>[1](#fn_1298), O beautiful one!
spoke these words, 'You do not pervade all this here as we do. You are
not the greatest among us, O Prâ*n*a, because the Apâna is subject to
you <span id="fr_1304"></span>[2](#fn_1299).' The Prâ*n*a again moved
about <span id="fr_1305"></span>[3](#fn_1300), and the Apâna <span
id="fr_1306"></span>[4](#fn_1301) said to him.

The Apâna said:

When I am extinct, all the life-winds in the body of living creatures
become extinct; and on my moving about, they again move about. I am the.
greatest. See I am extinct!

The Brâhma*n*a said:

Then the Vyâna and the Udâna addressed him who was speaking (thus): 'You
are not the greatest, O Apâna! because the Prâ*n*a is subject to you.'
Then the Apâna moved about, and the Vyâna spoke to him: 'I am the
greatest among (you) all. Hear the reason why. When I am extinct, all
the life-winds in the body of living creatures become extinct.

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

And on my moving about, they again move about. I am the greatest. See I
am extinct!'

The Brâhma*n*a said:

Then the Vyâna became extinct, and again moved about. And the Prâna and
Apâna, and the Udâna, and the Samâna, spoke to him, 'You are not the
greatest among us, O Vyâna! because the Samâna <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1](#fn_1302) is subject to you.' The Vyâna moved
about again, and the Samâna spoke again. 'I am the greatest among (you)
all. Hear the reason why. When I am extinct, all the life-winds in the
body of living creatures become extinct; and on my moving about, they
again move about. I am the greatest. See I am extinct!' Then the Samâna
moved about, and the Udâna said to him: 'I am the greatest among (you)
all. Hear the reason why. When I am extinct, all the life-winds in the
body of living creatures become extinct; and on my moving about, they
again move about. I am the greatest. See I am extinct!' Then the Udâna
became extinct, and again moved about. And the Prâ*n*a and Apâna, and
the Samâna, and the Vyâna also, spoke to him: 'O Udâna! you are not the
greatest. The Vyâna <span id="fr_1308"></span>[2](#fn_1303) only is
subject to you.'

The Brâhma*n*a said:

Then Brahman, the lord of (all) creatures, said. to them who were
assembled together: You are all greatest, and not greatest <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[3](#fn_1304). You are all possessed

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

of one another's qualities <span
id="fr_1310"></span>[1](sbe0836.htm#fn_1305). All are greatest in their
own spheres, and all support one another. There is one unmoving <span
id="fr_1311"></span>[2](sbe0836.htm#fn_1306) (life-wind). There are
others moving about, (which are) five, owing to (their) specific
qualities. My own self is one only <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[3](sbe0836.htm#fn_1307), (but) accumulated in
numerous (forms). Being friendly with one another, and pleasing one
another, go away happily. Welfare be to you! Support one another.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1291"></span>[270:1](sbe0834.htm#fr_1296) The senses are
the doors of the house here, as they are among the doors of the city at
Gîtâ, [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65).

<span id="fn_1292"></span>[270:2](sbe0834.htm#fr_1297) Owing to the want
of food, &c. Cf. Maitrî, p. 112, and *Kh*ândogya. p. 422.

<span id="fn_1293"></span>[270:3](sbe0834.htm#fr_1298) Perception of
pleasure, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra; but he takes the subsequent clause to
mean this, 'and without you no pleasure accrues to us either.' The text
is here in an unsatisfactory state.

<span id="fn_1294"></span>[270:4](sbe0835.htm#fr_1299) As stated in the
last chapter; some MSS. read 'your' for 'my' at the beginning of the
sentence.

<span id="fn_1295"></span>[270:5](sbe0835.htm#fr_1300) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says that in this Pañ*k*ahot*ri*-vidhâna the five chief Hot*ri*s only
are stated for briefly explaining the Prâ*n*âyâma.

<span id="fn_1296"></span>[271:1](sbe0835.htm#fr_1301) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says, 'The wind going to the Prâ*n*a, and being obstructed in upward
progress by the Prâ*n*a, goes to the Apâna, and then unable to go
upwards or downwards, enters the passages or nâ*d*îs of the body and
becomes Vyâna. In the same way Udâna, by the collision of the two,
produces sound in the throat, and depends on Prâ*n*a and Apâna; so, too,
the Samâna dwelling in the navel and kindling the gastric fire is also
dependent on those two.' The meaning seems to be that one life-wind is
distributed in the different places, and gets different names, as
stated, in the order mentioned. See Maitrî, p. 28.

<span id="fn_1297"></span>[271:2](sbe0835.htm#fr_1302) A similar visit
on the part of the Prâ*n*as (who, however, are not there the life-winds
only, but the Prâ*n*a life-wind and the active organs) to Pra*g*âpati is
mentioned at B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka-upanishad, p. 1016, and *Kh*ândogya, p.
297. Cf. also Pra*s*na, p. 178; B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 317; and
Kaushîtaki, p. 63. See also, generally, as to the life-winds and their
functions, B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 280, and *S*a<u>n</u>kara's comment
there; Yoga-sûtras III, 38, and comment; Cowell's note at Maitrî, p.
247; *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 184, st. 24-25; chap. 185,
st. 1 seq.; and [p. 258](sbe0832.htm#page_258) supra.

<span id="fn_1298"></span>[272:1](sbe0835.htm#fr_1303) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says, Vyâna and Apâna also by force of the two 'ands' which occur in the
original; and so in other places too.

<span id="fn_1299"></span>[272:2](sbe0835.htm#fr_1304) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says on this, 'The Prâ*n*a moves upwards through the help of the Apâna.
If it moved downwards, it would be simply absorbed into the Apâna.'

<span id="fn_1300"></span>[272:3](sbe0835.htm#fr_1305) I. e. recommenced
its, proper operation in its proper place.

<span id="fn_1301"></span>[272:4](sbe0835.htm#fr_1306) And the other
life-winds also, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra says, the name Prâ*n*a being merely
'indicative,' as the phrase is, of the class to which it belongs.

<span id="fn_1302"></span>[273:1](sbe0835.htm#fr_1307) Because the
Samâna helps in the digestion of the food which afterwards goes to the
Vyâna for distribution through the nâ*d*îs.

<span id="fn_1303"></span>[273:2](sbe0835.htm#fr_1308) Because the Udâna
is able to generate sound after the nâ*d*îs are filled up by the Vyâna.

<span id="fn_1304"></span>[273:3](sbe0835.htm#fr_1309) 'Not greatest'
because none of them is independent of the other. 'Greatest' Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra renders by 'superior to objects.'
