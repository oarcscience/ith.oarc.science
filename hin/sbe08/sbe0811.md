# CHAPTER IX.

Now I will speak to you, who are not given to carping, of that most
mysterious knowledge, accompanied by experience, by knowing which you
will be released from evil. It is the chief among the sciences, the
chief among the mysteries. It is the best means of sanctification. It is
imperishable, not

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

opposed to the sacred law. It is to be apprehended directly <span
id="fr_314"></span>[1](#fn_313), and is easy to practise. O terror of
your foes! those men who have no faith in this holy doctrine, return to
the path of this mortal world, without attaining to me. This whole
universe is pervaded by me in an unperceived form. All entities live in
me, but I do not live in them <span id="fr_315"></span>[2](#fn_314). Nor
yet do all entities live in me. See my divine power. Supporting all
entities and producing all entities, my self lives not in (those)
entities. As the great and ubiquitous atmosphere always remains in
space, know that similarly all entities live in me <span
id="fr_316"></span>[3](#fn_315). At the expiration of a Kalpa, O son of
Kuntî! all entities enter my nature; and at the beginning of a Kalpa, I
again bring them forth. Taking the control of my own nature <span
id="fr_317"></span>[4](#fn_316), I bring forth again and again this
whole collection of entities, without a will of its own <span
id="fr_318"></span>[5](#fn_317), by the power of nature. But, O
Ar*g*una! these actions do not fetter <span
id="fr_319"></span>[6](#fn_318) me, who remain like one unconcerned, and
who am unattached to those actions. Nature gives birth to movables and
immovables through me, the supervisor, and by reason of that <span
id="fr_320"></span>[7](#fn_319), O son of Kuntî! the universe revolves.
Deluded people of vain hopes, vain acts, vain

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

knowledge <span id="fr_321"></span>[1](#fn_320), whose minds are
disordered, and who are inclined to the delusive nature of Asuras and
Râkshasas, not knowing my highest nature as great lord of all entities,
disregard me as I have assumed a human body <span
id="fr_322"></span>[2](#fn_321). But the high-souled ones, O son of
P*ri*thâ! who are inclined to the godlike nature, knowing me as the
inexhaustible source of (all) entities, worship me with minds not
(turned) elsewhere.

Constantly glorifying me, and exerting themselves <span
id="fr_323"></span>[3](#fn_322), firm in their vows <span
id="fr_324"></span>[4](#fn_323), and saluting me with reverence,

they worship me, being always devoted. And others again, offering up the
sacrifice of knowledge, worship me as one, as distinct, and as
all-pervading in numerous forms <span id="fr_325"></span>[5](#fn_324). I
am the Kratu <span id="fr_326"></span>[6](#fn_325), I am the Ya*g*ña, I
am the Svadhâ, I the product of the herbs. I am the sacred verse. I too
am the sacrificial butter, and I the fire, I the offering <span
id="fr_327"></span>[7](#fn_326). I am the father of this universe, the
mother, the creator, the grandsire, the thing to be known, the means of
sanctification, the syllable Om <span id="fr_328"></span>[8](#fn_327),
the *Rik*, Sâman, and Ya*g*us also; the goal, the sustainer, the lord,
the supervisor, the

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

residence <span id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_328), the asylum, the friend,
the source, and that in which it merges, the support, the receptacle,
and the inexhaustible seed. I cause heat and I send forth and stop
showers. I am immortality and also death; and I, O Ar*g*una! am that
which is and that which is not <span id="fr_330"></span>[2](#fn_329).
Those who know the three (branches of) knowledge, who drink the Soma
juice, whose sins are washed away, offer sacrifices and pray to me for a
passage into heaven; and reaching the holy world of the lord of gods,
they enjoy in the celestial regions the celestial pleasures of the gods.
And having enjoyed that great heavenly world, they enter the mortal
world when (their) merit is exhausted <span
id="fr_331"></span>[3](#fn_330). Thus those who wish for objects of
desire, and resort to the ordinances of the three (Vedas), obtain (as
the fruit) going and coming. To those men who worship me, meditating on
me and on no one else, and who are constantly devoted, I give new gifts
and preserve what is acquired by them <span
id="fr_332"></span>[4](#fn_331). Even those, O son of Kuntî! who being
devotees of other divinities worship with faith, worship me only, (but)
irregularly <span id="fr_333"></span>[5](#fn_332). For I am the enjoyer
as well as the lord <span id="fr_334"></span>[6](#fn_333) of all
sacrifices. But they know me not truly, therefore do they fall <span
id="fr_335"></span>[7](#fn_334). Those who make vows <span
id="fr_336"></span>[8](#fn_335) to the gods go to the gods;

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

those who make vows to the manes go to the manes, those who worship the
Bhûtas go to the Bhûtas; and those likewise who worship me go to me.
Whoever with devotion offers me leaf, flower, fruit, water, that,
presented with devotion, I accept from him whose self is pure. Whatever
you do, O son of Kuntî! whatever you eat, whatever sacrifice you make,
whatever you give, whatever penance you perform, do that as offered to
me <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_336). Thus will you be released from
the bonds of action, the fruits of which are agreeable or disagreeable.
And with your self possessed of (this) devotion, (this)
renunciation <span id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_337), you will be released
(from the bonds of action) and will come to me. I am alike to all
beings; to me none is hateful, none dear. But those who worship me with
devotion (dwell) in me <span id="fr_339"></span>[3](#fn_338), and I too
in them. Even if a very ill-conducted man worships me, not worshipping
any one else, he must certainly be deemed to be good, for he has well
resolved <span id="fr_340"></span>[4](#fn_339). He soon becomes devout
of heart, and obtains lasting tranquillity. (You may) affirm, O son of
Kuntî! that my devotee is never ruined. For, O son of P*ri*thâ! even
those who are of sinful birth <span id="fr_341"></span>[5](#fn_340),
women, Vai*s*yas; and *S*ûdras likewise, resorting to me, attain the
supreme goal. What then (need

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

be said of) holy Brâhma*n*as and royal saints who are (my) devotees?
Coming to this transient unhappy <span
id="fr_342"></span>[1](sbe0812.htm#fn_341) world, worship me. (Place
your) mind on me, become my devotee, my worshipper; reverence me, and
thus making me your highest goal, and devoting your self to abstraction,
you will certainly come to me.

in this chapter.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[82:1](sbe0811.htm#fr_314) I. e. by immediate

the *S*yena sacrifice for destroying a foe.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[82:2](sbe0811.htm#fr_315) Because he is
untainted by anything. And therefore also the entities do not live in
him, as said in the next sentence. See [p. 80](sbe0810.htm#page_80)
supra.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[82:3](sbe0811.htm#fr_316) As space is
untainted and unaffected by the air which remains in it, so am I by the
entities.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[82:4](sbe0811.htm#fr_317) Supra, [p.
58](sbe0805.htm#page_58). Nature = the unperceived principle.

80](sbe0810.htm#page_80) supra.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[82:6](sbe0811.htm#fr_319) I am not affected by
the differences in the conditions of these entities.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[82:7](sbe0811.htm#fr_320) Viz. the
supervision.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[83:1](sbe0811.htm#fr_321) Hope, viz. that some
other deity will give them what they want; acts, vain as not offered to
the supreme; knowledge, vain as abounding in foolish doubts, &c.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[83:2](sbe0811.htm#fr_322) Cf. [p.
76](sbe0809.htm#page_76) supra.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[83:3](sbe0811.htm#fr_323) For a knowledge of
the supreme, or for the means of such knowledge.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[83:4](sbe0811.htm#fr_324) Vows = veracity,
harmlessness, &c.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[83:5](sbe0811.htm#fr_325) Sacrifice of
knowledge, viz. the knowledge that Vâsudeva is all; as one = believing
that all is one; as distinct = believing that sun, moon, &c. are
different manifestations of 'me.'

<span id="fn_325"></span>[83:6](sbe0811.htm#fr_326) Kratu is a Vedic
sacrifice; Ya*g*ña, a sacrifice laid down in Sm*ri*tis. Svadhâ =
offering to the manes; 'product of the herbs' = food prepared from
vegetables, or medicine.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[84:1](sbe0811.htm#fr_329) I. e. the seat of

the commentators.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[84:2](sbe0811.htm#fr_330) The gross and the
subtle elements, or causes and effects.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[84:3](sbe0811.htm#fr_331) Cf.
Mu*nd*akopanishad, p. 279; and *Kh*ândogya, p. 344.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[84:4](sbe0811.htm#fr_332) Cf. Dhammapada,

it.--Râmânu*g*a.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[84:5](sbe0811.htm#fr_333) Because in form they
worship other divinities.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[84:6](sbe0811.htm#fr_334) Giver of the fruit.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[85:1](sbe0811.htm#fr_337) Cf. [p.
55](sbe0805.htm#page_55) supra, and other passages.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[85:2](sbe0811.htm#fr_338) This mode of action
is at once devotion and renunciation: the first, because one cares not
for fruit; the second, because it is offered to the supreme.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[85:3](sbe0811.htm#fr_339) 'They dwell in me'
by their devotion to me; I dwell in them as giver of happiness to them.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[85:4](sbe0811.htm#fr_340) Viz. that the
supreme Being alone should be reverenced.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[85:5](sbe0811.htm#fr_341) *S*a<u>n</u>kara
takes Vai*s*yas &c. as examples of this; not so *S*rîdhara. Cf. as to
women and *S*ûdras, N*ri*si*m*ha-tâpinî, p. 14. 'Of sinful birth' = of
low birth (*S*rîdhara) = birth resulting from sins (*S*a<u>n</u>kara).
