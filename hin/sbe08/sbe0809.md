# CHAPTER VII.

The Deity said:

O son of P*ri*thâ! now hear how you can without doubt know me fully,
fixing your mind on me, and resting in me, and practising devotion. I
will now tell you exhaustively about knowledge together with experience;
that being known, there is nothing further left in this world to know.
Among thousands of men, only some <span id="fr_271"></span>[2](#fn_270)
work for perfection <span id="fr_272"></span>[3](#fn_271); and even of
those who have reached perfection, and who are assiduous, only some know
me truly. Earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, understanding,

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

and egoism <span id="fr_273"></span>[1](#fn_272), thus is my nature
divided eightfold. But this is a lower (form of my) nature. Know (that
there is) another (form of my) nature, and higher than this, which is
animate, O you of mighty arms! and by which this universe is upheld.
Know that all things have these (for their) source <span
id="fr_274"></span>[2](#fn_273). I am the producer and the destroyer of
the whole universe. There is nothing else, O Dhanañ*g*aya! higher than
myself; all this is woven upon me, like numbers of pearls upon a
thread <span id="fr_275"></span>[3](#fn_274). I am the taste in water, O
son of Kuntî! I am the light of the sun and moon. I am 'Om <span
id="fr_276"></span>[4](#fn_275)' in all the Vedas, sound <span
id="fr_277"></span>[5](#fn_276) in space, and manliness in human beings;
I am the fragrant smell in the earth, refulgence in the fire; I am life
in all beings, and penance <span id="fr_278"></span>[6](#fn_277) in
those who perform penance. Know me, O son of P*ri*thâ! to be the eternal
seed of all beings; I am the discernment of the discerning ones, and I
the glory of the glorious <span id="fr_279"></span>[7](#fn_278). I am
also the strength, unaccompanied by fondness or desire <span
id="fr_280"></span>[8](#fn_279), of the strong. And, O chief of the
descendants of Bharata! I am love unopposed to piety <span
id="fr_281"></span>[9](#fn_280) among all

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

beings. And all entities which are of the quality of goodness, and those
which are of the quality of passion and of darkness, know that they are,
indeed, all from me; I am not in them, but they are in me <span
id="fr_282"></span>[1](#fn_281). The whole universe deluded by these
three states of mind, developed from the qualities, does not know me,
who am beyond them and inexhaustible; for this delusion of mine,
developed from the qualities, is divine and difficult to transcend.
Those cross beyond this delusion who resort to me alone. Wicked men,
doers of evil (acts), who are deluded, who are deprived of their
knowledge by (this) delusion, and who incline to the demoniac state of
mind <span id="fr_283"></span>[2](#fn_282), do not resort to me. But, O
Ar*g*una! doers of good (acts) of four classes worship me: one who is
distressed, one who is seeking after knowledge, one who wants wealth,
and one, O chief of the descendants of Bharata! who is possessed of
knowledge. Of these, he who is possessed of knowledge, who is always
devoted, and whose worship is (addressed) to one (Being) only, is
esteemed highest. For to the man of knowledge I am dear above all
things, and he is dear to me. All these are noble. But the man possessed
of knowledge is deemed by me to be my own self. For he with (his) self
devoted to abstraction, has taken to me as the goal than which there is
nothing higher. At the end of many lives, the man possessed of knowledge
approaches me, (believing) that Vâsudeva is everything. Such a
high-souled man is very hard to find. Those who are deprived of
knowledge by various desires approach other

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

divinities, observing various regulations <span
id="fr_284"></span>[1](#fn_283), and controlled by their own
natures <span id="fr_285"></span>[2](#fn_284). Whichever form (of deity)
any worshipper wishes to worship with faith, to that form I render his
faith steady. Possessed Of that faith, he seeks to propitiate (the deity
in) that (form), and obtains from it those beneficial things which he
desires, (though they are) really given by me. But the fruit thus
(obtained) by them, who have little judgment, is perishable. Those who
worship the divinities go to the divinities <span
id="fr_286"></span>[3](#fn_285), and my worshippers, too, go to me. The
undiscerning ones, not knowing my transcendent and inexhaustible
essence, than which there is nothing higher, think me, who am
unperceived, to have become perceptible <span
id="fr_287"></span>[4](#fn_286). Surrounded by the delusion of my mystic
power <span id="fr_288"></span>[5](#fn_287), I am not manifest to all.
This deluded world knows not me unborn and inexhaustible. I know, O
Ar*g*una! the things which have been, those which are, and those which
are to be. But me nobody knows. All beings, O terror of (your) foes! are
deluded at the time of birth by the delusion, O descendant of Bharata!
caused by the pairs of opposites arising from desire and aversion. But
the men of meritorious actions, whose sins have terminated, worship me,
being released from the delusion (caused) by the pairs of

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

opposites, and being firm in their beliefs <span
id="fr_289"></span>[1](sbe0810.htm#fn_288). Those who, resting on me,
work for release from old age and death <span
id="fr_290"></span>[2](sbe0810.htm#fn_289), know the Brahman <span
id="fr_291"></span>[3](sbe0810.htm#fn_290), the whole Adhyâtma, and all
action. And those who know me with the Adhibhûta, the Adhidaiva, and the
Adhiya*g*ña, having minds devoted to abstraction, know me at the time of
departure (from this world).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_269"></span>[73:1](sbe0808.htm#fr_270) As distinguished
from the others who work half-heartedly, so to say. See [p.
72](sbe0808.htm#page_72).

<span id="fn_270"></span>[73:2](sbe0809.htm#fr_271) 'Some one' in the
original.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[73:3](sbe0809.htm#fr_272) I. e. knowledge of
the self. *S*a<u>n</u>kara says, as to the next clause, that those even
who work for final emancipation must be deemed to have 'reached
perfection.'

<span id="fn_272"></span>[74:1](sbe0809.htm#fr_273) This accords with
the Sâ<u>n</u>khya philosophy. See chapter I. sutra 61 of the current
aphorisms.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[74:2](sbe0809.htm#fr_274) Cf. infra, [p.
105](sbe0815.htm#page_105).

<span id="fn_274"></span>[74:3](sbe0809.htm#fr_275) Cf. Mundakopanishad,
p. 298.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[74:4](sbe0809.htm#fr_276) Infra, [p.
79](sbe0810.htm#page_79). Cf. Goldstücker's Remains, I, 14, 122;
Yoga-sûtras I, 27.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[74:5](sbe0809.htm#fr_277) I. e. the occult
essence which underlies all these and the other qualities of the various
things mentioned.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[74:6](sbe0809.htm#fr_278) I. e. power to bear
the pairs of opposites.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[74:7](sbe0809.htm#fr_279) Glory here seems to
mean dignity, greatness.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[74:8](sbe0809.htm#fr_280) Desire is the wish
to obtain new things; fondness is the anxiety to retain what has been
obtained. The strength here spoken of, therefore, is that which is
applied to the performance of one's own duties only.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[74:9](sbe0809.htm#fr_281) I. e. indulged
within the bounds allowed by the rules of the *S*âstras, namely, for the
procreation of sons &c. only.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[75:1](sbe0809.htm#fr_282) They do not dominate
over me, I rule them.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[75:2](sbe0809.htm#fr_283) Infra, [p.
115](sbe0818.htm#page_115).

<span id="fn_283"></span>[76:1](sbe0809.htm#fr_284) Fasts and so forth.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[76:2](sbe0809.htm#fr_285) Which are the result
of the actions done in previous lives.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[76:3](sbe0809.htm#fr_286) And the divinities
are not eternal, so the fruit obtained is ephemeral.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[76:4](sbe0809.htm#fr_287) The ignorant do not
know the real divinity of Vish*n*u, thinking him to be no higher than as
he is seen in the human form. This gives them an inadequate notion of
the purity and eternity of the happiness to be obtained by worshipping
him; cf. infra, [p. 83](sbe0811.htm#page_83).

<span id="fn_287"></span>[76:5](sbe0809.htm#fr_288) The veil surrounding
me is created by my mysterious power, and that everybody cannot pierce
through; cf. Ka*th*a, p. 117.
