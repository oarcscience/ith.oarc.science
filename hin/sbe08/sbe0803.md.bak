# BHAGAVADGÎTÂ.

## CHAPTER I.

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said

What did my (people) and the Pâ*nd*avas do, O Sañ*g*aya! when they
assembled together on the holy field of Kurukshetra, desirous to do
battle?

Sañ*g*aya said:

Seeing the army of the Pâ*nd*avas drawn up in battle-array <span
id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_86.md), the prince Duryodhana approached the
preceptor, and spoke (these) words: 'O preceptor! observe this grand
army of the sons of Pâ*nd*u, drawn up in battle-array by your talented
pupil, the son of Drupada. In it are heroes (bearing) large bows, the
equals of Bhîma and Ar*g*una in battle--(namely), Yuyudhâna, Virâ*t*a,
and Drupada, the master of a great car <span
id="fr_88"></span>[2](#fn_87.md), and Dh*ri*sh*t*aketu, *K*ekitâna, and the
valiant king of Kâsî, Puru*g*it and Kuntibho*g*a, and that eminent man
*S*aibya; the heroic Yudhâmanyu, the valiant Uttamau*g*as, the son of
Subhadrâ, and the sons of Draupadî--all masters of great cars. And now,
O best of Brâhma*n*as!

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

learn who are most distinguished among us, and are leaders of my army. I
will name them to you, in order that you may know them well. Yourself,
and Bhîshma, and Kar*n*a, and K*ri*pa the victor of (many) battles;
A*s*vatthâman, and Vikar*n*a, and also the son of Somadatta, and many
other brave men, who have given up their lives for me, who fight with
various weapons, (and are) all dexterous in battle. Thus our army which
is protected by Bhîshma is unlimited; while this army of theirs which is
protected by Bhîma is very limited. And therefore do ye all, occupying
respectively the positions <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_88.md) assigned
to you, protect Bhîshma <span id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_89.md) only.'

Then his powerful grandsire, Bhîshma, the oldest of the Kauravas,
roaring aloud like a lion, blew his conch, (thereby) affording delight
to Duryodhana. And then all at once, conchs, and kettledrums, and
tabors, and trumpets were played upon; and there was a tumultuous din.
Then, too, Mâdhava and the son of Pâ*nd*u (Ar*g*una), seated in a grand
chariot to which white steeds were yoked, blew their heavenly conchs.
H*ri*shîke*s*a <span id="fr_91"></span>[3](#fn_90.md) blew the
Pâñ*k*a*g*anya <span id="fr_92"></span>[4](#fn_91.md), and Dhanañ*g*aya the
Devadatta, and Bhîma, (the doer) of fearful deeds, blew the great conch
Pau*nd*ra. King Yudhish*th*ira, the son of Kuntî <span
id="fr_93"></span>[5](#fn_92.md), blew the Anantavi*g*aya, and Nakula and
Sahadeva (respectively)

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

the Sughosha and Ma*n*ipushpaka. And the king of Kâ*s*î, too, who has an
excellent bow, and Sikha*nd*in, the master of a great car, and
Dh*ri*sh*t*adyumna, Virâ*t*a, and the unconquered Sâtyaki, and Drupada,
and the sons of Draupadî, and the son of Subhadrâ, of mighty arms, blew
conchs severally from all sides, O king of the earth! That tumultuous
din rent the hearts of all (the people) of Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra's (party),
causing reverberations throughout heaven and earth. Then seeing (the
people of ) Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra's party regularly marshalled, the son of
Pâ*nd*u, whose standard is the ape, raised his bow <span
id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_93.md), after the discharge of missiles had
commenced, and O king of the earth! spake these words to H*ri*shîke*s*a:
'O undegraded one! station my chariot between the two armies, while I
observe those, who stand here desirous to engage in battle, and with
whom, in the labours of this struggle, I must do battle. I will observe
those who are assembled here and who are about to engage in battle,
wishing to do service in battle <span id="fr_95"></span>[2](#fn_94.md) to
the evil-minded son of Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra.'

Sañ*g*aya said:

Thus addressed by Gu*d*âke*s*a <span id="fr_96"></span>[3](#fn_95.md), O
descendant of Bharata <span id="fr_97"></span>[4](#fn_96.md)!
H*ri*shîke*s*a stationed that excellent chariot between the two armies,
in front of Bhîshma and Dro*n*a and of all the kings of the earth, and

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

said O son of P*ri*thâ! look at these assembled Kauravas.' There the son
of P*ri*thâ saw in both armies, fathers and grandfathers, preceptors,
maternal uncles, brothers, sons <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_97.md),
grandsons, companions, fathers-in-law, as well as friends. And seeing
all those kinsmen standing (there), the son of Kuntî was overcome by
excessive pity, and spake thus despondingly.

Ar*g*una said:

Seeing these kinsmen, O K*ri*sh*n*a! standing (here) desirous to engage
in battle, my limbs droop down; my mouth is quite dried up; a tremor
comes on my body; and my hairs stand on end; the Gâ*nd*îva (bow) slips
from my hand; my skin burns intensely. I am unable, too, to stand up; my
mind whirls round, as it were; O Ke*s*ava! I see adverse omens <span
id="fr_99"></span>[2](#fn_98.md); and I do not perceive any good (to
accrue) after killing (my) kinsmen in the battle. I do not wish for
victory, O K*ri*sh*n*a! nor sovereignty, nor pleasures: what is
sovereignty to us, O Govinda! what enjoyments, and even life? Even
those, for whose sake we desire sovereignty, enjoyments, and pleasures,
are standing here for battle, abandoning life and wealth-preceptors,
fathers, sons as well as grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law,
grandsons, brothers-in-law, as also (other) relatives. These I do not
wish to kill, though they kill (me), O destroyer of Madhu <span
id="fr_100"></span>[3](#fn_99.md)! even for the sake of sovereignty over
the three worlds, how much less then for this earth

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

(alone)? What joy shall be ours, O *G*anârdana! after killing
Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra's sons? Killing these felons <span
id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_100.md) we shall only incur sin. Therefore it is
not proper for us to kill our own kinsmen, the sons of
Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra. For how, O Mâdhava! shall we be happy after killing
our own relatives? Although having their consciences corrupted by
avarice, they do not see the evils flowing from the extinction of a
family, and the sin in treachery to friends, still, O Ganârdana! should
not we, who do see the evils flowing from the extinction of a family,
learn to refrain from that sin? On the extinction of a family, the
eternal rites of families are destroyed <span
id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_101.md). Those rites being destroyed, impiety
predominates over the whole family <span
id="fr_103"></span>[3](#fn_102.md). In consequence of the predominance of
impiety, O K*ri*sh*n*a! the women of the family become corrupt <span
id="fr_104"></span>[4](#fn_103.md); and the women becoming corrupt, O
descendant of V*ri*sh*n*i! intermingling of castes results; that
intermingling necessarily leads the family and the destroyers of the
family to hell; for when the ceremonies of (offering) the balls of food
and water (to them) fail <span id="fr_105"></span>[5](#fn_104.md), their
ancestors fall down (to hell). By these transgressions of the destroyers
of families, which occasion interminglings of castes, the eternal rites
of castes and rites, of families are

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

subverted. And O *G*anârdana! we have heard that men whose family-rites
are subverted, must necessarily live in hell. Alas! we are engaged in
committing a heinous sin, seeing that we are making efforts for killing
our own kinsmen out of greed of the pleasures of sovereignty. If the
sons of Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra, weapon in hand, should kill me in battle, me
weaponless and not defending (myself), that would be better for me.

Sañ*g*aya said:

Having spoken thus, Ar*g*una cast aside his bow together with the
arrows, on the battle-field, and sat down in (his) chariot, with a mind
agitated by grief.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_86"></span>[37:1](sbe0803.htm#fr_87.md) Several of these modes
of array are described in Manu VII, 187, like a staff, like a wain, like
a boar, &c. That of the Pâ*nd*avas, here referred to, appears to have
been like the thunderbolt, as to which see Manu VII, 191.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[37:2](sbe0803.htm#fr_88.md) This is a literal
rendering; the technical meaning is 'a warrior proficient in military
science, who can fight single-handed a thousand archers.'

<span id="fn_88"></span>[38:1](sbe0803.htm#fr_89.md) The original word
means, according to *S*rîdhara, 'the ways of entrance into a Vyûha or
phalanx.'

<span id="fn_89"></span>[38:2](sbe0803.htm#fr_90.md) Who, as generalissimo,
remained in the centre of the army.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[38:3](sbe0803.htm#fr_91.md) Literally, according
to the commentators, 'lord of the senses of perception.'

<span id="fn_91"></span>[38:4](sbe0803.htm#fr_92.md) Schlegel renders the
names of these conchs by Gigantea, Theodotes, Arundinea, Triumphatrix,
Dulcisona, and Gemmiflorea respectively.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[38:5](sbe0803.htm#fr_93.md) So called, par
excellence, apparently.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[39:1](sbe0803.htm#fr_94.md) I. e. to join in the
fight.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[39:2](sbe0803.htm#fr_95.md) In the original,
several derivatives from the root yudh, meaning 'to fight,' occur with
the same frequency as 'battle' here.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[39:3](sbe0803.htm#fr_96.md) Generally interpreted
'lord of sleep,' i. e. not indolent. Nîlaka*nth*a also suggests, that it
may mean 'of thick hair.'

<span id="fn_96"></span>[39:4](sbe0803.htm#fr_97.md) The son of Dushyanta
and *S*akuntalâ, after whom India is called 'Bhâratavarsha,' and from
whom both Pâ*nd*avas and Kauravas were descended.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[40:1](sbe0803.htm#fr_98.md) The words in this list
include all standing in similar relationships to those directly
signified.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[40:2](sbe0803.htm#fr_99.md) Such as the appearance
of vultures, cars moving without horses, &c., mentioned in the Bhîshma
Parvan II, 17. Cf. Sutta Nipâta, p. 100.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[40:3](sbe0803.htm#fr_100.md) A demon of this name.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[41:1](sbe0803.htm#fr_101.md) Six classes are
mentioned: an incendiary; one who administers poison; one who assaults
another--weapon in hand; one who destroys property; one who robs another
of his wife; or his fields.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[41:2](sbe0803.htm#fr_102.md) I. e. there being
none to attend to the 'rites,' women being ineligible.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[41:3](sbe0803.htm#fr_103.md) I. e. the surviving
members.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[41:4](sbe0803.htm#fr_104.md) I. e. either by the
mere fact of relationship to such men, or by following their bad
example.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[41:5](sbe0803.htm#fr_105.md) There being no
qualified person to perform them; 'their ancestors'--that is to say, of
the 'destroyers of families.'
