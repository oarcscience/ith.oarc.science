# CHAPTER XIX.

The Brâhma*n*a's wife said:

This is not possible to be understood by one whose self <span
id="fr_1476"></span>[1](#fn_1471.md) is frivolous, or by one whose self is
not refined; and my intelligence is very frivolous, and narrow, and
confused. Tell me the means by which this knowledge is acquired. I (wish
to) learn from you the source from which that knowledge proceeds.

The Brâhma*n*a said

Know that he who devotes himself to the Brahman is the (lower) Arani,
the instructor is the upper Arani. Penance and sacred learning cause the
attrition <span id="fr_1477"></span>[2](#fn_1472.md), and from that the
fire of knowledge is produced.

The Brâhma*n*a's wife said:

As to this symbol of the Brahman which is denominated the Kshetra*g*ña,
where, indeed, is (to be found) a description of it, by which it <span
id="fr_1478"></span>[3](#fn_1473.md) is capable of being comprehended?

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

The Brâhmana said:

He is without symbols <span id="fr_1479"></span>[1](#fn_1474.md), and also
without qualities; nothing exists that is a cause of him. I will only
state the means by which he can be comprehended or not. A good means is
found, namely, action <span id="fr_1480"></span>[2](#fn_1475.md) and
knowledge, by which that <span id="fr_1481"></span>[3](#fn_1476.md)
(entity), which has the symbols (useful) for knowledge <span
id="fr_1482"></span>[4](#fn_1477.md) attributed to it through ignorance, is
perceived as by bees <span id="fr_1483"></span>[5](#fn_1478.md). In the
(rules for) final emancipation, it is not laid down, that a certain
thing should be done, and a certain thing should not <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[6](#fn_1479.md). But the knowledge of the things
beneficial to the self is produced in one who sees and hears <span
id="fr_1485"></span>[7](#fn_1480.md). One should adopt as many of these
things, (which are) means of direct perception, as may here be
practicable--unperceived, and those whose form is perceived <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[8](#fn_1481.md), in hundreds and in thousands, all of
various descriptions. Then one reaches near that beyond which nothing
exists.

The Deity said:

Then the mind of the Brâhma*n*a's wife, after the

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

destruction of the Kshetra*g*ña <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1](sbe0847.htm#fn_1482.md), turned to that which is
beyond (all) Kshetra*g*ñas by means of a knowledge of the Kshetra <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[2](sbe0847.htm#fn_1483.md).

Ar*g*una said:

Where, indeed, O K*ri*sh*n*a! is that Brâhma*n*a's wife, and where is
that chief of Brâhma*n*as, by both of whom this perfection was attained?
Tell me about them both, O undegraded one!

The Deity said:

Know my mind to be the Brâhma*n*a, and know my understanding to be the
Brâhmana's wife. And he, O Dhanañ*g*aya! who has been spoken of as the
Kshetra*g*ña, is I myself <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[3](sbe0847.htm#fn_1484.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1471"></span>[308:1](sbe0846.htm#fr_1476.md) I. e. mind,
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1472"></span>[308:2](sbe0846.htm#fr_1477.md) Scil. of the
Ara*n*is (i. e. the wood used for kindling fire); the sense is, that the
pupil who has penance and Vedic learning goes to a teacher for
knowledge. See *S*vetâ*s*vatara pp. 307, 308.

<span id="fn_1473"></span>[308:3](sbe0846.htm#fr_1478.md) I. e. the
Brahman, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, of which the Kshetra*g*ña is only a
symbol. For a definition of Kshetra*g*ña, see *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha),
chap. 187, st. 23.

<span id="fn_1474"></span>[309:1](sbe0846.htm#fr_1479.md) See
Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p. 160](sbe0823.htm#page_160.md).

<span id="fn_1475"></span>[309:2](sbe0846.htm#fr_1480.md) Viz. that which
is required as a preliminary to the acquisition of knowledge, and hence
is necessary for final emancipation.

<span id="fn_1476"></span>[309:3](sbe0846.htm#fr_1481.md) The Brahman.

<span id="fn_1477"></span>[309:4](sbe0846.htm#fr_1482.md) I. e. symbols
which are to convey a knowledge of the Brahman.

<span id="fn_1478"></span>[309:5](sbe0846.htm#fr_1483.md) I. e. in a way
not perfect; as bees hovering above a flower get the fragrance of it
without grasping the flower itself, so these means give one an imperfect
knowledge of the Brahman to be afterwards perfected by constant
meditation upon it (nididhyâsa).

<span id="fn_1479"></span>[309:6](sbe0846.htm#fr_1484.md) As it is in the
prior portion of the Vedas, as to sacrifices, &c.

<span id="fn_1480"></span>[309:7](sbe0846.htm#fr_1485.md) Sees, i. e. by
contemplation; hears, i. e. from a teacher, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1481"></span>[309:8](sbe0846.htm#fr_1486.md) This seems to
mean such things as hearing, reading, &c., which would be 'perceived'
scil. by the senses; and all intellectual operations which would be
'unperceived.'
