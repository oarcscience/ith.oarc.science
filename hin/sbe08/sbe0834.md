# CHAPTER VII.

The Brâhma*n*a said:

On this, too, O beautiful one! they relate this ancient story, (which
shows) of what description is the institution of the seven sacrificial
priests <span id="fr_1284"></span>[6](#fn_1279.md). The

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

nose, and the eye, and the tongue, and the skin, and the ear as the
fifth, mind and understanding, these are the seven sacrificial priests
separately stationed. Dwelling in a minute space, they do not perceive
each other. Do you, verily, O beautiful one! learn about these
sacrificial priests, (which are) seven according to (their several)
natures.

The Brâhma*n*a's wife said:

How (is it) these do not perceive each other, dwelling (as they do) in a
minute space? What are their natures, O venerable sir? Tell me this, O
lord!

The Brâhma*n*a said:

Not knowing the qualities (of anything) is ignorance (of it). Knowledge
of the qualities is knowledge. And these never know the qualities of
each other. The tongue, the eye, the ear likewise, the skin, the mind,
and the understanding also, do not apprehend smells, the nose apprehends
them. The nose, the eye, the ear likewise, the skin, the mind, and the
understanding also, do not apprehend tastes, the tongue apprehends them.
The nose, the tongue, the ear likewise,, the skin, the mind, and the
understanding also, do not apprehend colours, the eye apprehends them.
The nose, the tongue, and next the eye, the ear, the understanding, the
mind likewise, do not apprehend (objects of) touch, the skin apprehends
them. The nose, the tongue, and the eye, the skin, the mind, and the
understanding also, do not apprehend sounds, the ear apprehends them.
The nose, the tongue, and the eye, the skin, the ear, and the
understanding also, do not apprehend doubt, the mind apprehends it. The
nose, the tongue, and the eye, the skin, the ear, and the mind

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

also, do not apprehend final determination, the understanding apprehends
it. On this, too, they relate this ancient story,--a dialogue, O
beautiful one! between the senses and the mind.

The mind said:

The nose smells not without me, the tongue does not perceive taste, the
eye does not take in colour, the skin does not become aware of any
(object of) touch. Without me, the ear does not in any way hear sound. I
am the eternal chief among all elements <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[1](#fn_1280.md). Without me, the senses never shine,
like an empty dwelling, or like fires the flames of which are extinct.
Without me, all beings, like fuel half dried and half moist, fail to
apprehend qualities or objects, even with the senses exerting
themselves <span id="fr_1286"></span>[2](#fn_1281.md).

The senses said:

This would be true as you believe, if you, without us, enjoyed the
enjoyments (derived from) our objects <span
id="fr_1287"></span>[3](#fn_1282). If when we are extinct, (there is.md)
pleasure and support of life, and if you enjoy enjoyments, then what
you. believe is true; or if when we are absorbed <span
id="fr_1288"></span>[4](#fn_1283.md), and objects are standing, you enjoy
objects according to their natures by the mere operation of the mind.

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

\[paragraph continues\] If again you think your power over our objects
is constant <span id="fr_1289"></span>[1](#fn_1284.md), then take in
colours by the nose, take in tastes by the eye, take in smells by the
ear, take in (objects of) touch by the tongue, and take in sounds by the
skin, and also (objects of) <span id="fr_1290"></span>[2](#fn_1285.md)
touch by the understanding. For those who are powerful have no rules (to
govern them); rules are for the weak. You should accept enjoyments
unenjoyed before; you ought not to enjoy what has been tasted. <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[3](#fn_1286) (by others.md). As a pupil goes to a
preceptor for Vedic learning, and having acquired Vedic learning from
him, performs the directions of the Vedic texts, so you treat as
yours <span id="fr_1292"></span>[4](#fn_1287.md) objects shown <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[5](#fn_1288.md) by us, both past and future <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[6](#fn_1289.md), in sleep and likewise wakefulness.
Besides, when creatures of little intelligence are distracted in mind,
life is seen to be supported, when our objects <span
id="fr_1295"></span>[7](#fn_1290.md) perform their functions. And even
after having carried on numerous mental operations, and indulged in
dreams, a creature, when troubled by desire to enjoy, does run to
objects of sense only. One entering upon enjoyments, resulting from
mental operations (alone), and not connected with objects

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

of sense, (which is) like entering a house without a door <span
id="fr_1296"></span>[1](sbe0835.htm#fn_1291.md), always meets death, on the
exhaustion of the life-winds <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[2](sbe0835.htm#fn_1292.md), as a fire which is kindled
(is extinguished) on the exhaustion of fuel. Granted, that we have
connexions with our (respective) qualities, and granted that we have no
perception of each other's qualities; still, without us, you have no
perception <span id="fr_1298"></span>[3](sbe0835.htm#fn_1293.md), and so
long no happiness can accrue to you.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1274"></span>[266:1](sbe0833.htm#fr_1279.md) *Kh*ândogya, p.
285, and the passage there quoted by *S*a<u>n</u>kara as well as
Ânandagiri's gloss. And see, [p. 353](sbe0856.htm#page_353.md) infra.

<span id="fn_1275"></span>[266:2](sbe0833.htm#fr_1280.md) Viz. the part of
it which specially appertains to speech--the throat, &c.

<span id="fn_1276"></span>[266:3](sbe0833.htm#fr_1281.md) All the nâ*d*îs
or passages of the body, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1277"></span>[266:4](sbe0833.htm#fr_1282.md) I. e. at the
navel in the form of sound., as the material cause of all words. There
and in that condition speech dwells after going through the body, as
above stated. There, adds Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, devotees are to meditate on
speech.

<span id="fn_1278"></span>[266:5](sbe0833.htm#fr_1283.md) This is not quite
clear, but the meaning seems to be, that the merit of the immovable mind
consists in its unchangeability, and that of speech in being the cause
of variations in the movable mind by conveying new knowledge and new
impressions. Cf. on this result, *Kh*ândogya-upanishad, p. 482.

<span id="fn_1279"></span>[266:6](sbe0834.htm#fr_1284.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra,
says, the last chapter explained Prâ*n*âyâma, and this explains
Pratyâhâra. Prâ*n*âyâma is the restraint of the life-winds, Pratyâhâra
that of the senses, according to the Yoga philosophy (see the quotation
in the commentary at Yoga-sûtra III, 1, and see also pp. 141-145). Cf.
also Gîtâ, [p. 61](sbe0806.htm#page_61.md). The Saptahot*ri*-vidhâna as
taught in the Taittirîya-brâhmana and Âra*n*yaka is to be found a few
pages after the pages referred to for the Dasahot*ri*-vidhâna at [p.
261](sbe0833.htm#page_261.md) supra. And the other Vidhânas also are to be
found in the same parts of those books.

<span id="fn_1280"></span>[268:1](sbe0834.htm#fr_1285.md) Cf.
Kaushîtaki-upanishad, p. 93; *Kh*ândogya, p. 297; Maitrî, p. 158; and
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 284. The passages in the last two works seem to
be identical ones.

<span id="fn_1281"></span>[268:2](sbe0834.htm#fr_1286.md) I. e. in their
respective operations.

<span id="fn_1282"></span>[268:3](sbe0834.htm#fr_1287.md) The implication,
of course, is, as Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, says, that this is not so, as what
is not perceived by the senses cannot be the object of the mind's
operations,--a proposition which reminds one of the maxim, 'Nihil est in
intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu,' apparently without Leibnitz's
limitation of it. Cf. Archbishop Thomson's Laws of Thought, p. 52.

<span id="fn_1283"></span>[268:4](sbe0834.htm#fr_1288.md) As in sleep, &c.

<span id="fn_1284"></span>[269:1](sbe0834.htm#fr_1289.md) I. e. if you can
enjoy objects independently of the senses, whenever you choose to
perform your operations. This, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra meets an objection
which might be made, that the mind at the time stated does not desire
objects.

<span id="fn_1285"></span>[269:2](sbe0834.htm#fr_1290.md) Sic in original.
It comes twice.

<span id="fn_1286"></span>[269:3](sbe0834.htm#fr_1291.md) Eating what has
been tasted by another is a cause of degradation. Cf. *Kh*ândogya, p.
81; Maitrî, p. 103; and [p. 363](sbe0858.htm#page_363.md) infra.

<span id="fn_1287"></span>[269:4](sbe0834.htm#fr_1292.md) You incorrectly
attribute to yourself the quality of apprehending them.

<span id="fn_1288"></span>[269:5](sbe0834.htm#fr_1293.md) I. e. presented
before you by us.

<span id="fn_1289"></span>[269:6](sbe0834.htm#fr_1294.md) This is not quite
clear. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra has, 'not past, not future;' literally, 'not
come, not gone.'

<span id="fn_1290"></span>[269:7](sbe0834.htm#fr_1295.md) Viz. smell,
sound, &c.; not by the mere operations of the mind, but by obtaining the
objects, is life supported.
