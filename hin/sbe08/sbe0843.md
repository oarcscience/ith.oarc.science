# CHAPTER XVI.

The Brâhma*n*a said:

There are, verily, three foes in (this) world, and they are stated to be
(divided) ninefold, according to qualities. Exultation, pleasure,
joy <span id="fr_1445"></span>[4](#fn_1440), these three

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

are qualities appertaining to the quality of goodness. Grief, wrath,
persistent hatred, these are stated to be qualities appertaining to the
quality of passion. Sleep, sloth, and delusion, these three qualities
are qualities appertaining to the quality of darkness. Cutting these off
by multitudes of arrows <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1](#fn_1441), a
courageous man, free from sloth, having a tranquil self, and senses
controlled, is energetic about subjugating others <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[2](#fn_1442). On this, people who know about
ancient times celebrate verses which were sung of old by the king
Ambarîsha, who had become tranquil (in mind). When vices <span
id="fr_1448"></span>[3](#fn_1443) were in the ascendant, and good (men)
were oppressed, Ambarîsha, of great glory, forceably possessed himself

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

of the kingdom <span id="fr_1449"></span>[1](#fn_1444). He (then)
restraining his own vices, and honouring good men, attained high
perfection, and sang these verses: 'I have conquered most vices;
destroyed all foes; but there is one, the greatest, vice which should be
destroyed and which I have not destroyed--that (vice), being impelled by
which, a creature does not attain freedom from desire, and being
troubled by desire, understands (nothing) while running into
ditches <span id="fr_1450"></span>[2](#fn_1445); (that vice), being
impelled by which, a man even does what ought not to be done. That
avarice--cut (it) off, cut (it) off with sharp swords. For from
avarice <span id="fr_1451"></span>[3](#fn_1446) is born desire; then
anxiety comes into existence; and he who desires, mostly acquires
qualities appertaining to the quality of passion. Obtaining those, he
mostly acquires qualities appertaining to the quality of darkness <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[4](#fn_1447). When the bodily frame is destroyed,
he, owing to these qualities, is born again and again, and engages in
action. And at the expiration of life, again with his body dismembered
and scattered about, he meets death, and again birth. Therefore,
properly perceiving this, and restraining avarice by courage, one should
wish for sovereignty in the self. This is sovereignty <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[5](#fn_1448); there is no other sovereignty here.
The self properly understood is itself the sovereign.' Such were

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

the verses sung with regard to the great sovereignty, by the glorious
Ambarîsha, who destroyed the one (chief vice), avarice.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1437"></span>[300:1](sbe0842.htm#fr_1442) I. e. the
râ*g*a-yoga, says Nîlaka*nth*a, which consists in mere control of the
mind. Cf. Sâ*n*khya-sâra, p. 39.

<span id="fn_1438"></span>[300:2](sbe0842.htm#fr_1443) See Yoga-sûtra,
p. 45.

<span id="fn_1439"></span>[300:3](sbe0842.htm#fr_1444) This means
difficult, and occasioning many trials to one who performs it.

<span id="fn_1440"></span>[300:4](sbe0843.htm#fr_1445) Nîlaka*nth*a says
exultation is when one is sure of obtaining what is desired, pleasure
when it is obtained, and joy when the thing obtained is enjoyed.
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra takes a different distinction; but our copy of his
commentary is not quite intelligible in <span id="page_301">p.
301</span> the beginning. Pleasure he takes to mean 'pride felt in
supposing oneself to possess some merit,' and joy that produced when
impending danger is averted. As to the next triad, the text is again
unsatisfactory. The text printed in the edition which contains
Nîlaka*nth*a's commentary, is 'desire, anger,' &c. There is nothing
about them in the commentary. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's text is the one we have
adopted. He says, 'grief, pain caused by loss of what is desired; anger,
the pain caused by the counteraction of one's attempts to injure
another; persistent hatred, the pain caused by believing another to be
doing harm to oneself.' Persistent hatred is Nîlaka*nth*a's
interpretation. I think his interpretation is preferable. The two triads
seem to be based on one principle of gradation. The distinctive marks of
the three qualities are pleasure, pain, and delusion respectively, and
those characterise the three triads stated in the text. See *S*ânti
Parvan (Moksha), chap. 194, st. 27 seq.

<span id="fn_1441"></span>[301:1](sbe0843.htm#fr_1446) Tranquillity and
so forth, Nîlaka*nth*a; practising yoga or concentration of mind,
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1442"></span>[301:2](sbe0843.htm#fr_1447) I. e. external,
says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra; external foes of one's own emancipation is, I
presume, what is meant.

<span id="fn_1443"></span>[301:3](sbe0843.htm#fr_1448) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says, I his own and those of others.' Nîlaka*nth*a takes good to mean
not men, but tranquillity, &c. The next sentence seems rather to
militate against this view, which in itself is not a well-founded one.

<span id="fn_1444"></span>[302:1](sbe0843.htm#fr_1449) For the good of
the people, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1445"></span>[302:2](sbe0843.htm#fr_1450) I. e. base
actions, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1446"></span>[302:3](sbe0843.htm#fr_1451) Avarice,
according to Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, is the belief that one has not got that
which one has, and desire is the wish for more and more. Avarice seems,
however, to be the general frame of mind, always wishing for something,
never being contented, and desire is the wish for a specific object.

<span id="fn_1447"></span>[302:4](sbe0843.htm#fr_1452) Which are sources
of delusion. Cf. a similar doctrine at Âpastamba II, 5, 140.

<span id="fn_1448"></span>[302:5](sbe0843.htm#fr_1453) Nîlaka*nth*a
compares Taittirîya, p. 26.
