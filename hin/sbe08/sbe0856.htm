The earth is the source&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1762"></A><A HREF="#fn_1755"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> of smells, water of tastes, the light (of) the sun is the source of colours, the wind is stated to be the source of (the feelings of) touch; likewise space is the source of sound. These are the qualities of the elements. Now I shall proceed to state the highest and first of all entities. The sun is</P>

The G&acirc;yatr&icirc; is the first among metres; among (sacrificial) animals, the goat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1768"></A><A HREF="#fn_1761"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> is mentioned (as the first).

<P>all liquid substances which are to be drunk, water is the best. And among all immovable entities, without distinction, the Plaksha, the ever holy field of Brahman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1772"></A><A HREF="#fn_1765"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, is stated to be the first. I, too, (am the first) among all the patriarchs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1773"></A><A HREF="#fn_1766"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, there is no doubt of that. And the unthinkable, self-existent Vish<I>n</I>u is stated to be my own self. Of all mountains, the great Meru is stated to be the first-born. And among all quarters and sub-quarters, likewise, the eastern quarter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1774"></A><A HREF="#fn_1767"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is the first. Likewise the Ga<U>n</U>g&acirc; going in three paths is stated to be the first-born among rivers. And likewise of all wells and reservoirs of water, the ocean is the first-born. And of all gods, D&acirc;navas, Bh&ucirc;tas, Pi<I>s</I>&acirc;<I>k</I>as, snakes, and Rakshases, and of men, Kinnaras, and Yakshas, &Icirc;<I>s</I>vara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1775"></A><A HREF="#fn_1768"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is the lord. The great Vish<I>n</I>u, who is full of the Brahman, and than whom there is no higher being in these three worlds, is the source of all the universe. Of all orders&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1776"></A><A HREF="#fn_1769"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, that of householders (is the first), there is no doubt of that. The unperceived is the source of the worlds; and the same is also the end of everything. Days end with (the sun's) setting&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1777"></A><A HREF="#fn_1770"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>; the night ends with (the sun's) rising; the end of pleasure is ever grief;</P>

<P>the end of grief ever pleasure. All accumulations end in exhaustion; all ascents end in falls; all associations end in dissociations; and life ends in death. All action ends in destruction; death is certain for whatever is born&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1778"></A><A HREF="sbe0857.htm#fn_1771"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; (everything) movable or immovable in this world is ever transient. Sacrifice, gift, penance, study, observances, and regulations, all this ends in destruction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1779"></A><A HREF="sbe0857.htm#fn_1772"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. There is no end for knowledge. Therefore one whose self is tranquil, whose senses are subjugated, who is devoid of (the idea that this or that is) mine, who is devoid of egoism, is released from all sins by pure knowledge.</P>

Unmoving probably means 'not perturbed by the qualities' (G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0816.htm#page_110">p. 110</A>), or perhaps the same thing as 'of steady mind' at G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0814.htm#page_101">p. 101</A>.

<P><A NAME="fn_1754"></A><A HREF="sbe0856.htm#fr_1761">352:6</A> This is specified, says Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra, as the six months of the northern solstice are caused by the sun being at this Nakshatra. As to those six months, cf. G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0810.htm#page_81">p. 81</A>. For the same reason, Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra adds, the winter season is mentioned as the best.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1755"></A><A HREF="sbe0856.htm#fr_1762">352:7</A> The word &acirc;di, literally beginning, is used in the whole of this passage in different senses; it means the source, it means the best, and it means the first in order.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1756"></A><A HREF="sbe0856.htm#fr_1763">353:1</A> This should be compared with the enumeration at <A HREF="sbe0854.htm#page_345">p. 345</A> supra, and that in the G&icirc;t&acirc; there referred to.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1757"></A><A HREF="sbe0856.htm#fr_1764">353:2</A> Cf. <A HREF="sbe0855.htm#page_346">p. 346</A> supra. N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a takes fire to mean the gastric fire, and bh&ucirc;ta, rendered by us elements, to mean the species of beings born from eggs and wombs.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1760"></A><A HREF="sbe0856.htm#fr_1767">353:5</A> Here he turns back to the S&acirc;vitr&icirc;, 'looking back in the manner of the lion,' says N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, and for purposes of up&acirc;san&acirc;. He does not give up the thread of his discourse entirely, but simply interjects this little clause. N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a adds, S&acirc;vitr&icirc; here includes every mode of worship prescribed for Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, &amp;c., and even for Mle<I>kkh</I>as. Cf. note 3, and Gautama.(B&uuml;hler's ed.), p. 74 note.</P>

Is the north the best as the seat of the higher world mentioned at <I>S</I>&acirc;nti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 192, st. 8 seq.?</P>

A part of them appears to be quoted in S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-s&ucirc;tra V, 80. And the commentator Vi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na Bhikshu introduces it with the expression 'iti <I>s</I>r&ucirc;yate.' But it is not a Vedic text.</P>
