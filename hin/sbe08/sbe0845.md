# CHAPTER XVIII.

The Brâhma*n*a said:

O modest one! I do not move about in this world in the way which,
according to your own understanding, you have guessed. I <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[5](#fn_1463.md) am a Brâhma*n*a, I am

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

emancipated, I am a forester, and I likewise perform the duties of a
householder, observing vows. I am not such, O beautiful one! as you see
me with the eye. I pervade every single thing that is in this world.
Whatever creatures there are in the world, movable or not moving, know
me to be the destroyer of them as fire is of wood <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[1](#fn_1464.md). Sovereignty over the whole world, and
even over heaven; that, or else this knowledge; (of these two) knowledge
is my only wealth <span id="fr_1470"></span>[2](#fn_1465.md). This <span
id="fr_1471"></span>[3](#fn_1466.md) is the path of the Brâhma*n*as, by
which those who understand that <span id="fr_1472"></span>[4](#fn_1467.md)
proceed, to households, or residence in forests, or, dwelling with
preceptors, or among mendicants <span id="fr_1473"></span>[5](#fn_1468.md).
With numerous unconfused symbols only one knowledge is approached. And
those who, adhering to various symbols and Â*s*ramas, have their
understanding full of tranquillity <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[6](#fn_1469.md), go to the single entity as rivers to
the ocean. This path is traversed by the understanding, not by the
body <span id="fr_1475"></span>[7](#fn_1470.md). Actions have a beginning
and an end, and the body is tied down by action. Hence, O beautiful one!
you

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

(need) have no fear occasioned by the other world. With your heart
intent upon the real entity, you will certainly come into my self.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1459"></span>[306:1](sbe0844.htm#fr_1464.md) I. e. to put him
to the test. Such examinations are often referred to in our later
literature.

<span id="fn_1460"></span>[306:2](sbe0844.htm#fr_1465.md) I. e. Veda, says
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1461"></span>[306:3](sbe0844.htm#fr_1466.md) I. e. says
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, which leads to the seat from which there is no return.
Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112.md).

<span id="fn_1462"></span>[306:4](sbe0844.htm#fr_1467.md) The wheel is the
yoga, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. The expression is noteworthy, as being that
used of Buddha's teaching. See on that Davids' Buddhism, p. 45.

<span id="fn_1463"></span>[306:5](sbe0845.htm#fr_1468.md) The man who has
achieved final emancipation has got that, in which the benefits to be
derived from the course of life of a Brâhma*n*a, &c., are included (see
[p. 191](sbe0826.htm#page_191) supra.md). Hence, says he, the <span
id="page_307">p. 307</span> doubt, on which your question is based as to
what world you will go to by being joined to me, is wrong. See [p.
256](sbe0832.htm#page_256.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1464"></span>[307:1](sbe0845.htm#fr_1469.md) He is speaking
here on the footing of the essential identity of everything. Cf. Gîtâ,
[p. 62](sbe0806.htm#page_62.md).

<span id="fn_1465"></span>[307:2](sbe0845.htm#fr_1470.md) The expression
here is clumsy; the meaning is that he prefers knowledge to sovereignty,
if the alternative is offered him.

<span id="fn_1466"></span>[307:3](sbe0845.htm#fr_1471.md) Viz. knowledge.

<span id="fn_1467"></span>[307:4](sbe0845.htm#fr_1472.md) I. e. the
Brahman.

<span id="fn_1468"></span>[307:5](sbe0845.htm#fr_1473.md) These are the
four orders or Â*s*ramas.

<span id="fn_1469"></span>[307:6](sbe0845.htm#fr_1474.md) The knowledge to
be acquired, by whatever symbols the attempt to acquire it is made, is
but this, that all is one; and that is acquired certainly when
tranquillity has been achieved.

<span id="fn_1470"></span>[307:7](sbe0845.htm#fr_1475.md) I. e. by
realising the identity of everything, not by the actions performed with
the body, which, as he goes on to show, are perishable, and cannot lead
to any lasting result.
