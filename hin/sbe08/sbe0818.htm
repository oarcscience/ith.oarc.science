<P>final emancipation, demoniac for bondage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_490"></A><A HREF="#fn_487"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Grieve not, O descendant of Bharata! you are born to godlike endowments. (There are) two classes of created beings in this world, the godlike and the demoniac; the godlike (class) has been described at length; now hear from me, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! about the demoniac. Demoniac persons know not action or inaction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_491"></A><A HREF="#fn_488"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, neither purity nor yet (correct) conduct nor veracity are in them. They say the universe is devoid of truth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_492"></A><A HREF="#fn_489"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, devoid of fixed principle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_493"></A><A HREF="#fn_490"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and devoid of a ruler, produced by union (of male and female) caused by lust&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_494"></A><A HREF="#fn_491"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, and nothing else. Holding this view, (these) enemies of the world, of ruined&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_495"></A><A HREF="#fn_492"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> selfs, of little knowledge, and of ferocious actions, are born for the destruction (of the world). Entertaining insatiable desire, full of vanity, ostentatiousness, and frenzy, they adopt false notions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_496"></A><A HREF="#fn_493"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> through delusion, and engage in unholy observances. Indulging in boundless thoughts ending with death&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_494"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, given up to the enjoyment of objects of desire, being resolved that that is all, bound down by nets of hopes in hundreds, given up to anger and desire, they wish</P>

<P>to obtain heaps of wealth unfairly for enjoying objects of desire. 'This have I obtained to-day; this wish I will obtain; this wealth is mine; and this also shall be mine; this foe I have killed; others too I will destroy; I am lord, I am the enjoyer, I am perfect&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, strong, happy; I have wealth; I am of noble birth; who else is like me? I will sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; I will make gifts; I will rejoice.' Thus deluded by ignorance, tossed about by numerous thoughts, surrounded by the net of delusion, and attached to the enjoyment of objects of desire, they fall down into impure hell. Honoured (only) by themselves, void of humility, and full of the pride and frenzy of wealth, these calumniators (of the virtuous) perform sacrifices, which are sacrifices only in name, with ostentatiousness and against prescribed rules&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_497"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; indulging (their) vanity, brute force, arrogance, lust, and anger; and hating me in their own bodies and in those of others&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. These enemies&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, ferocious, meanest of men, and unholy, I continually hurl down, to these worlds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_500"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, only into demoniac wombs. Coming into demoniac wombs, deluded in every birth, they go down to the vilest state, O son of Kunt&icirc;! without ever coming to me. Threefold is this way, to hell,--</P>

<P>ruinous to the self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="sbe0819.htm#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,--lust, anger, and likewise avarice; therefore one should abandon this triad. Released from these three ways to darkness, O son of Kunt&icirc;! a man works out his own welfare, and then proceeds to the highest goal. He&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="sbe0819.htm#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who abandoning scripture ordinances, acts under the impulse of desire, does not attain perfection&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="sbe0819.htm#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, nor happiness, nor the highest goal. Therefore in discriminating between w hat should be done and what should not be done, your authority (must. be) scripture. And knowing what is declared by the ordinances of scripture, you should perform action in this world.</P>
