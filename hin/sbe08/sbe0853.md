# CHAPTER XXVI.

Brahman said:

That Mahat which was first produced, is (afterwards) called egoism; when
it is born as (the feeling itself) <span
id="fr_1633"></span>[7](#fn_1626.md) I, that is said to be the second
creation. That egoism is stated to be the source of all entities <span
id="fr_1634"></span>[8](#fn_1627.md),

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

that from which the changes take place <span
id="fr_1635"></span>[1](#fn_1628.md); it is full of light, the supporter of
consciousness; it is that from which the people are produced, the
Pra*g*âpati. It is a deity, the producer of the deities, and of the
mind; it is the creator of the three worlds. That which feels <span
id="fr_1636"></span>[2](#fn_1629) thus--'I am all this'--is called (by.md)
that (name). That eternal world is for those sages who are contented
with knowledge relating to the self, who have pondered on the self, and
who are perfected by sacred study and sacrifice. By <span
id="fr_1637"></span>[3](#fn_1630.md) consciousness of self one enjoys the
qualities; and thus that source of all entities, the producer of the
entities, creates (them); and as that from which the changes take place,
it causes all this to move; and by its own light, it likewise charms the
world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1620"></span>[333:1](sbe0852.htm#fr_1627.md) I. e. says
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, the world of the understanding. Does this mean the
world of Hira*n*yagarbha? The understanding is said to be the 'subtle
body' of Hira*n*yagarbha (Vedânta Paribhâshâ, p. 46). Probably the
reference spiritually interpreted is to the state in which egoism and
all its products are non-existent.

<span id="fn_1621"></span>[333:2](sbe0852.htm#fr_1628.md) Literally, 'the
high and holy passage to the great self.'

<span id="fn_1622"></span>[333:3](sbe0852.htm#fr_1629.md) The Mahat first
manifests itself as Vish*n*u before it manifests itself as Brahman or
*S*iva (Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, p. 16), hence he is. sate to be the Lord in
the primary creation. It may be added, that in the Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra
where this passage is quoted the original word rendered 'cognition'
above (khyâti) does not occur. but in lieu of it occurs Brahman. The
sentence 'And the talented man' &c. is also wanting there.

<span id="fn_1623"></span>[333:4](sbe0852.htm#fr_1630.md) I. e. the
understanding. See *S*a<u>n</u>kara on *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 329;
Ka*th*a, p. 100.

<span id="fn_1624"></span>[333:5](sbe0852.htm#fr_1631.md) Source of
enlightenment, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Cf. Mu*nd*aka, pp. 303-308 (gloss).

<span id="fn_1625"></span>[333:6](sbe0852.htm#fr_1632.md) I. e. attaching
himself to the Purusha, as the never-changing reality, and rising above
Prakriti and its manifestations.

<span id="fn_1626"></span>[333:7](sbe0853.htm#fr_1633.md) I. e. when the
Mahat develops into the feeling of self-consciousness--I--then it
assumes the name of egoism.

<span id="fn_1627"></span>[333:8](sbe0853.htm#fr_1634.md) See on this
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra. Hall's Introd. p. 31, note.

<span id="fn_1628"></span>[334:1](sbe0853.htm#fr_1635.md) So Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra. Nîlaka*nth*a says it means 'born from the change, or
development, viz. Mahat.' The Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, p. 17, however, shows
it means 'appertaining to the quality of goodness.' See also
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ 25, and commentary there, which is of great help
here. The sense is this: Egoism is of three descriptions; it appertains
to the quality of goodness, and as such is the creator of the deities
and mind, the deities being those presiding over the ten senses (cf.
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, p. 17); it is full of light, or appertains to the
quality of passion (cf. ibid.), and as such imparts to the other two
qualities their virtue of activity (cf. Sâ<u>n</u>khya- kârikâ
commentary, p. 91, Târânâth's ed.); it is also of the quality of
darkness, and as such the producer of the: triple world (see ibid.) See
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sûtra II, 17, 18, and comment, where a view somewhat
different in one or two details is stated.

<span id="fn_1629"></span>[334:2](sbe0853.htm#fr_1636.md)
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, p. 16; Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ 24, p. 89 (Târânâth's
ed.)

<span id="fn_1630"></span>[334:3](sbe0853.htm#fr_1637.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says that the words Aha<u>n</u>kâra &c. are here explained; qualities
here means objects, as at Gîtâ, [p. 55](sbe0805.htm#page_55.md). The
meaning of the first clause is, that the feeling that the objects are
for oneself, and therefore enjoying them, gives the name of
Aha<u>n</u>kâra to the principle in question, its creation of all the
elements gives it the name of Bhûtâdi. It is called Vaikârika, as the
cause of the various activities and developments going on. The last
clause seems to be an explanation of the epithet Tai*g*asa, also applied
to egoism.
