# CHAPTER XXXIII.

Brahman said:

Some (think of) the Brahman as a tree; some (think of) the Brahman as a
great forest; and some (think of) the Brahman as unperceived; and some
as transcendent and without misery <span
id="fr_1928"></span>[3](#fn_1920.md); and they <span
id="fr_1929"></span>[4](#fn_1921.md) think all this to be produced from and
absorbed into the unperceived. He who even for (the space of) a (single)
exhalation, at the time of the termination (of life <span
id="fr_1930"></span>[5](#fn_1922).md) becomes equable <span
id="fr_1931"></span>[6](#fn_1923.md), attaining to the self, becomes fit
for immortality. Restraining the self in the self <span
id="fr_1932"></span>[7](#fn_1924), even for (the space of.md) a wink, he
repairs to the inexhaustible acquisition <span
id="fr_1933"></span>[8](#fn_1925.md) of those who have knowledge, through
the tranquillity of the self <span id="fr_1934"></span>[9](#fn_1926.md).
And restraining the life-winds again and

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

again by control of the life-winds <span
id="fr_1935"></span>[1](#fn_1927.md), of ten or twelve <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[2](#fn_1928) (modes), (he repairs to.md) that which is
beyond the twenty-four <span id="fr_1937"></span>[3](#fn_1929.md). Thus
having first a tranquil self, be obtains whatever he desires. When the
quality of goodness predominates in the unperceived <span
id="fr_1938"></span>[4](#fn_1930.md), that fits one for immortality. The
men of knowledge extol nothing else beyond goodness. By inference <span
id="fr_1939"></span>[5](#fn_1931) we understand the (attainment to the.md)
being to depend on goodness. It is not possible otherwise <span
id="fr_1940"></span>[6](#fn_1932.md) to attain to that being, O best of the
twice-born! Forgiveness, courage, harmlessness, equability, truth,
straightforwardness, knowledge, abandonment <span
id="fr_1941"></span>[7](#fn_1933.md), and also renunciation are laid down
as (constituting) conduct

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

of the quality of goodness. By this very inference the wise verily
believe in the Being and nature as one, there is no doubt of that. Some
learned. men, who are devoted to knowledge, assert the unity of the
Kshetra*g*ña and nature <span id="fr_1942"></span>[1](#fn_1934.md). But
that is not correct. That they are always distinct (from one another) is
also (said) without (due) consideration <span
id="fr_1943"></span>[2](#fn_1935.md). Distinction and also
association <span id="fr_1944"></span>[3](#fn_1936.md) should be accurately
understood. Unity and diversity <span id="fr_1945"></span>[4](#fn_1937.md)
are likewise laid down. Such is the doctrine of the learned. Between the
gnat and the udumbara <span id="fr_1946"></span>[5](#fn_1938.md) there is
observed unity and diversity also. As a fish is in water distinct (from
it), such is their relation; (such is) the relation of the drops of
water with the leaf of the lotus.

The preceptor said:

Then those Brâhma*n*as, who were the best of sages, having again felt
doubts, interrogated the grandsire of the people who spoke to them thus.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1918"></span>[372:1](sbe0859.htm#fr_1926.md) See [p.
351](sbe0855.htm#page_351.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1919"></span>[372:2](sbe0859.htm#fr_1927.md) See Gîtâ, [p.
109](sbe0816.htm#page_109.md).

<span id="fn_1920"></span>[372:3](sbe0860.htm#fr_1928.md) As to the first
two clauses comp. pp.
[284](sbe0838.htm#page_284)-[371](sbe0859.htm#page_371.md) supra; the last
two are said by Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra to represent the Sâ<u>n</u>khya and
Yoga doctrines respectively.

<span id="fn_1921"></span>[372:4](sbe0860.htm#fr_1929.md) I presume this
means all teachers. But Nîlaka*nth*a takes it to mean the
Sâ<u>n</u>khyas, and he takes the preceding words as indicating two
views based on *S*ruti texts, viz. the first, that the world is a
development of the Brahman, and the other that the Brahman does not
undergo any development or change. Anâmaya he takes to mean changeless,
and Brahmamaya he takes to mean developed from the Brahman.

<span id="fn_1922"></span>[372:5](sbe0860.htm#fr_1930.md) Cf. Gîtâ, pp.
[77](sbe0809.htm#page_77), [78](sbe0810.htm#page_78.md).

<span id="fn_1923"></span>[372:6](sbe0860.htm#fr_1931.md) One who sees the
supreme as the only real entity, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Nîlaka*nth*a takes it
to mean one who identifies himself with everything. See Gîtâ, [p.
65](sbe0807.htm#page_65), and note  [4](sbe0805.htm#fn_172.md) there.

<span id="fn_1924"></span>[372:7](sbe0860.htm#fr_1932.md) See [p.
344](sbe0854.htm#page_344.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1925"></span>[372:8](sbe0860.htm#fr_1933.md) I. e. the goal to
be acquired.

<span id="fn_1926"></span>[372:9](sbe0860.htm#fr_1934.md)
'Tranquillity'--the original may also be rendered by 'favour,' <span
id="page_373">p. 373</span> as to which cf. [p.
234](sbe0828.htm#page_234.md) supra, but further on the phrase 'having a
tranquil self' occurs, where the latter sense is not quite suitable. See
Gîtâ, [p. 51](sbe0804.htm#page_51.md), and Yoga-sûtra I, 33.

<span id="fn_1927"></span>[373:1](sbe0860.htm#fr_1935.md) I. e. the
specific modes which are mentioned of control of life-winds, e. g. at
Gîtâ, [p. 61](sbe0806.htm#page_61.md), or Yoga-sûtra II, 49 seq.

<span id="fn_1928"></span>[373:2](sbe0860.htm#fr_1936.md) Nîlaka*nth*a
proposes two interpretations of this. He says the ten are the eight
mentioned in Yoga-sûtra II, 29, and in addition tarka and vairâgya (as
to which see Yoga-sûtra I, 15 and 17). To make up the twelve he
substitutes for the last two the four named at Yoga-sûtra I, 33. He also
suggests that 'ten or twelve' may mean twenty-two, which he makes up
thus. The five modes of yama (Yoga-sûtra II, 30), five of niyama (ibid.
32), the remaining six in Yoga-sûtra II, 29, the four in Yoga-sûtra I,
33, and tarka and vairâgya as before.

<span id="fn_1929"></span>[373:3](sbe0860.htm#fr_1937.md) The twenty-four
are the elements according to the Sânkhya system. See
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, p. 11, and [p. 368](sbe0858.htm#page_368.md) supra.
That which is beyond them is Purusha.

<span id="fn_1930"></span>[373:4](sbe0860.htm#fr_1938.md) The unperceived,
it should be noted, is made up of the three qualities; the predominance
of goodness indicates enlightenment or knowledge. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
108](sbe0816.htm#page_108.md).

<span id="fn_1931"></span>[373:5](sbe0860.htm#fr_1939.md) The middle term
in the inference being, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, the enlightening effect
of the quality in question.

<span id="fn_1932"></span>[373:6](sbe0860.htm#fr_1940.md) Cf. [p.
167](sbe0824.htm#page_167.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1933"></span>[373:7](sbe0860.htm#fr_1941.md) The original is
tyâga, which Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra renders by 'abandonment of all
belongings;' renunciation, scil. of fruit. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
121](sbe0819.htm#page_121), and [p. 114](sbe0817.htm#page_114.md).

<span id="fn_1934"></span>[374:1](sbe0860.htm#fr_1942.md) Here, says
Nîlaka*nth*a, the author indicates an objection to the proposition
stated just before. But the passage is not clear.

<span id="fn_1935"></span>[374:2](sbe0860.htm#fr_1943.md) This, says
Nîlaka*nth*a, is a reply to the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas, who hold the two to be
distinct. Nîlaka*nth*a adds, that if the two are distinct, nature will,
conceivably, adhere even to an emancipated creature; and if they are
one, then the being or self would be really engaging in action and so
forth, and that activity being really a property of the self, could not
be destroyed save by the destruction of the self. Hence that view is
also wrong.

<span id="fn_1936"></span>[374:3](sbe0860.htm#fr_1944.md) Like that of sea
and wave, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1937"></span>[374:4](sbe0860.htm#fr_1945.md) Unity of Brahman
and diversity of manifestation or nature, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, who adds--by
reason of the association they are spoken of as one, by reason of the
unity and diversity they are distinct. The next sentence contains three
parallel cases.

<span id="fn_1938"></span>[374:5](sbe0860.htm#fr_1946.md) Cf. as to all
this, *S*ânti Parvan, chap. 194, st. 38 seq. (Moksha Dharma); chap. 249,
st. 20 seq.; chap. 285, st. 33 seq.
