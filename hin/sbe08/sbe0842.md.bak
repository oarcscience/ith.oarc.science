# CHAPTER XV.

The Pit*ri*s said:

On this <span id="fr_1433"></span>[1](#fn_1428.md), too, they relate an
ancient story; hearing that (story), O best of the twice-born! you
should act accordingly. There was (once) a royal sage, named Alarka,
whose penance was very great, who understood duty, who was veracious,
high-souled, and very firm in his vows. Having with his bow conquered
this world as far as the ocean,--having performed very difficult
deeds <span id="fr_1434"></span>[2](#fn_1429.md),--he turned his mind to
subtle <span id="fr_1435"></span>[3](#fn_1430) (subjects.md). While he was
sitting at the foot of a tree, O you of great intelligence! his
thoughts, abandoning (those) great deeds, turned to subtle (questions).

Alarka said:

My mind is become (too) strong <span id="fr_1436"></span>[4](#fn_1431.md);
that conquest is constant in which the mind is conquered. (Though)
surrounded by enemies, I shall direct my arrows elsewhere <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[5](#fn_1432.md). As by its unsteadiness, it
wishes <span id="fr_1438"></span>[6](#fn_1433.md), to

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

make all mortals perform action, I will cast very sharp-edged arrows at
the mind.

The mind said:

These arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will,
only pierce your own vital part, and your vital part being pierced, you
will die. Look out for other arrows by which you may destroy me.

Hearing that, he then spoke these words after consideration:--

Alarka said:

Smelling very many perfumes, one hankers after them only. Therefore I
will cast sharp arrows at the nose.

The nose <span id="fr_1439"></span>[1](#fn_1434.md) said.

These arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will
only pierce your own vital part, and your vital part being pierced, you
will die. Look out for other arrows by which you may destroy me.

Hearing that, he then spoke these words after consideration:--

Alarka said:

Enjoying savory tastes, this (tongue) hankers after

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

them only. Therefore I will cast sharp arrows at the tongue.

The tongue said:

These arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will
only pierce your own vital part, and your vital part being pierced, you
will die. Look out for other arrows by which you may destroy me.

Hearing that, he then spoke these words after consideration:--

Alarka said:

Touching various (objects of) touch, the skin hankers after them only.
Therefore I will tear off the skin by various feathered arrows.

The skin said:

These arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will
only pierce your own vital part, and your vital part being pierced, you
will die. Look out for other arrows by which you may destroy me.

Hearing that, he then said after consideration:--

Alarka said:

Hearing various sounds, the (ear) hankers after them only. Therefore I
(will) cast sharp arrows at the ear.

The ear said:

These arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will
only pierce your own vital part, and then you will lose (your) life.
Look out for other arrows by which you may destroy me.

Hearing that, he then said after consideration:--

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

Alarka said:

Seeing numerous colours, the eye hankers after them only. Therefore I
will destroy the eye with sharp arrows.

The eye said:

These arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will
only pierce your own vital part, and your vital part being pierced, you
will die. Look out for other arrows by which you may destroy me.

Hearing that, he then said after consideration:--

Alarka said:

This (understanding) forms various determinations by its operation.
Therefore I will cast sharp arrows at the understanding.

The understanding said:

These arrows, O Alarka! will not penetrate through me at all. They will
only pierce your own vital part, and your vital part being pierced, you
will die. Look out for other arrows by which you may destroy me.

The Brâhma*n*a <span id="fr_1440"></span>[1](#fn_1435.md) said:

Then Alarka even there employed himself in a fearful penance <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[2](#fn_1436.md) difficult to perform; but he did not
obtain any arrows for these seven by his devotions. Then that king
deliberated with a mind very intent on one (subject), and after
deliberating for a long time, O best of the twice-born! Alarka, the best
of talented (men), could not arrive at anything better

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

than concentration of mind <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[1](sbe0843.htm#fn_1437.md). Then directing his mind to
one point <span id="fr_1443"></span>[2](sbe0843.htm#fn_1438.md), he became
steady, and applied himself to concentration of mind. And (then) the
brave man forthwith destroyed the senses with one arrow; and entering
the self by means of concentration of mind, he reached the highest
perfection. And the royal sage, amazed, then uttered this verse, 'O!
Alas! that we should have engaged in all external (matters); that being
possessed of a desire for enjoyments, we should have devoted ourselves
before now to sovereignty! I have now subsequently learnt that there is
no higher happiness than concentration of mind.' Do you understand this
too, O Râma! and do not kill Kshatriyas. Perform a fearful <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[3](sbe0843.htm#fn_1439.md) penance, thence you will
obtain the highest good. Thus spoken to by (his) grandfathers, the noble
son of Gamadagni engaged himself in fearful penance, and attained that
perfection which is difficult to reach.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1428"></span>[296:1](sbe0842.htm#fr_1433.md) The impropriety
or sinfulness of slaughter.

<span id="fn_1429"></span>[296:2](sbe0842.htm#fr_1434.md) Such as the
subjugation of enemies and so forth.

<span id="fn_1430"></span>[296:3](sbe0842.htm#fr_1435.md) The Brahman, says
Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1431"></span>[296:4](sbe0842.htm#fr_1436.md) I. e. too strong
to be under control.

<span id="fn_1432"></span>[296:5](sbe0842.htm#fr_1437.md) That is to say,
elsewhere than towards the external foes with whom he was waging war.

<span id="fn_1433"></span>[296:6](sbe0842.htm#fr_1438.md) The text is
unsatisfactory here. I adopt Nîlaka*nth*a's reading.

<span id="fn_1434"></span>[297:1](sbe0842.htm#fr_1439.md) This and the
other corresponding words must be understood to refer not to the
physical nose and so forth, but the sense seated there. The nose here,
for instance, stands for the sense of smell. Nîlaka*nth*a understands
all these words of Alarka as indicating the so-called Ha*th*a-yoga,
which, he adds, invariably occasions death. As to the throwing of arrows
at the mind, he says, it means, 'I will subdue the mind by the restraint
of the excretive organs by means of the Ha*th*a-yoga.' And finally he
says, A man, having restrained all the senses by means of the
Ha*th*a-yoga, merely droops away; becoming deficient in those senses, he
does not accomplish his end.

<span id="fn_1435"></span>[299:1](sbe0842.htm#fr_1440.md) Sic in our
copies. It should be the Pit*ri*s, seeing that they are relating
Alarka's story to Para*s*urâma.

<span id="fn_1436"></span>[299:2](sbe0842.htm#fr_1441.md) Meditation, or
pondering, according to Nîlaka*nth*a.
