# CHAPTER XXIV.

Brahman said:

The qualities cannot be explained altogether distinctly (from one
another). Passion, goodness, and darkness likewise are seen mixed up
(with one another). They are attached to one another, they feed on one
another. They all depend on one another, and likewise follow one
another <span id="fr_1600"></span>[2](#fn_1593). There is no doubt of
this, that as long <span id="fr_1601"></span>[3](#fn_1594) as there is
goodness so long darkness exists. And as long as goodness and darkness,
so long is passion said (to exist) here. They perform their journey
together, in union, and moving about collectively. For they act with
cause or without cause <span id="fr_1602"></span>[4](#fn_1595), moving
in a body. Of all these acting with one another, but differing in
development, the increase and diminution will now be stated. Where
darkness is increased, abiding, <span id="fr_1603"></span>[5](#fn_1596)
in the lower entities, there passion should be understood to be little,
and goodness likewise to be less. Where

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

passion is developed, abiding in those of the middle current <span
id="fr_1604"></span>[1](#fn_1597), there darkness should be understood
to be little, and goodness likewise to be less. And where goodness is
developed, abiding in those of the upward current <span
id="fr_1605"></span>[2](#fn_1598), there darkness should be understood
to be little, and passion likewise to be less <span
id="fr_1606"></span>[3](#fn_1599). Goodness is the cause of the
modifications in the senses, and the enlightener <span
id="fr_1607"></span>[4](#fn_1600). For there is no other higher duty
laid down than goodness. Those who adhere to (the ways of) goodness go
up; the passionate remain in the middle; the men of the quality of
darkness, being connected with the lowest quality, go down <span
id="fr_1608"></span>[5](#fn_1601). The three qualities abide in the
three castes thus: darkness in the *S*ûdra, passion in the Kshatriya,
and the highest, goodness, in the Brâhma*n*a <span
id="fr_1609"></span>[6](#fn_1602). Even from afar <span
id="fr_1610"></span>[7](#fn_1603), darkness, goodness, and passion also,
are seen to have been together and moving about collectively. We have
never heard of them (as existing) separately. Seeing the sun rising,
evildoers are alarmed, and travellers, suffering trouble from the heat,
feel the warmth. The sun is goodness developed, evil-doers likewise are
darkness, and the heat to the travellers is said to be a property of

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

passion <span id="fr_1611"></span>[1](#fn_1604). The light in the sun is
goodness; the heat is the quality of passion; and its eclipse on the
Parvan <span id="fr_1612"></span>[2](#fn_1605) days must be understood
to be of the quality of darkness. So in all shining bodies, there: exist
three qualities. And they act by turns in the several places in several
ways. Among immovable entities, darkness is in the form of their
belonging to the lower species; the qualities of passion are variable;
and the oleaginous property is of the quality of goodness <span
id="fr_1613"></span>[3](#fn_1606). The day should be understood to be
threefold, the night is stated to be threefold, and likewise months,
half-months, years, seasons, and the conjunctions <span
id="fr_1614"></span>[4](#fn_1607). Threefold are the gifts given <span
id="fr_1615"></span>[5](#fn_1608), threefold the sacrifices performed,
threefold are the

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

worlds, threefold the gods, threefold the (departments of) knowledge,
and threefold the path <span id="fr_1616"></span>[1](#fn_1609). The
past, the present, and the future; piety, wealth, and lust; the Prâ*n*a,
the Apâna, and the Udâna; these are the three qualities. And whatever
there is in this world, all that is (made of) these three
qualities <span id="fr_1617"></span>[2](#fn_1610). The three
qualities--goodness, passion, and darkness also--are always acting
unperceived. The creation of the qualities is eternal. Darkness,
unperceived, holy <span id="fr_1618"></span>[3](#fn_1611), constant,
unborn, womb, eternal, nature, change <span
id="fr_1619"></span>[4](#fn_1612), destruction, Pradhâna, production and
absorption, not developed, not small, unshaking, immovable, immutable,
existent and also non-existent <span
id="fr_1620"></span>[5](#fn_1613)--all these, the unperceived,
(consisting) of the three qualities, is said to be. These names should
be learnt by men who ponder on matters relating to the self. He who
understands correctly all the names of the unperceived, and the
qualities, and its pure operations, he, freed from the body,
understanding the truth about (all) distinctions, and being free from
all misery, is released from all qualities.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1592"></span>[328:1](sbe0850.htm#fr_1599) Cf. Gîtâ inter
alia, [p. 104](sbe0815.htm#page_104).

<span id="fn_1593"></span>[328:2](sbe0851.htm#fr_1600) Cf. [p.
318](sbe0848.htm#page_318) supra.

<span id="fn_1594"></span>[328:3](sbe0851.htm#fr_1601) So Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra. Nîlaka*nth*a says on this, 'However much goodness may be
increased, it is still held in cheek by darkness, and thus there is the
continual relation of that which checks and that which is checked
between the three qualities; hence they are alike. So also passion being
increased, holds goodness and darkness in cheek. The sense seems to be
that the qualities dominate all in this world and exist together though
varying in strength' (Gîtâ, [p. 73](sbe0808.htm#page_73)).

<span id="fn_1595"></span>[328:4](sbe0851.htm#fr_1602) I. e.
spontaneously, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Cf. *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha), chap. 194,
st. 35.

<span id="fn_1596"></span>[328:5](sbe0851.htm#fr_1603) It is in the
lower species that darkness is predominant.

<span id="fn_1597"></span>[329:1](sbe0851.htm#fr_1604) I. e. the human
species, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 109](sbe0816.htm#page_109).

<span id="fn_1598"></span>[329:2](sbe0851.htm#fr_1605) See Gîtâ, [p.
109](sbe0816.htm#page_109), also [p. 327](sbe0850.htm#page_327) supra.
In his Sâ<u>n</u>khyatattvakaumudî, Vâ*k*aspati Mi*s*ra applies the
epithet to Yogins (see p. 13 of Târânâth's edition, and the editor's
note there)

<span id="fn_1599"></span>[329:3](sbe0851.htm#fr_1606) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
108](sbe0816.htm#page_108).

<span id="fn_1600"></span>[329:4](sbe0851.htm#fr_1607) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
109](sbe0816.htm#page_109). The modifications of the senses constituting
perception by them is an operation of the quality of goodness. This
seems to be the meaning of the text; as to this, cf. Tattvakaumudi, p.
14 (Târânâth's edition).

<span id="fn_1601"></span>[329:5](sbe0851.htm#fr_1608) See Gîtâ, [p.
109](sbe0816.htm#page_109); the words are nearly identical.

<span id="fn_1602"></span>[329:6](sbe0851.htm#fr_1609) Cf. Sânti Parvan
(Moksha), chap. 188, st. 15. The Vai*s*ya is omitted here.

<span id="fn_1603"></span>[329:7](sbe0851.htm#fr_1610) I. e. Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra says, even after much observation.

<span id="fn_1604"></span>[330:1](sbe0851.htm#fr_1611) This illustrates
the existence of the qualities as one body. Even the enlightening sun,
which embodies the quality of goodness, produces effects which belong to
the other qualities. The fear and sorrow which evil-doers, that is
thieves, feel, is an effect of the rising of the sun, which appertains
to the quality of darkness, and the heat as being the cause of vexation
and consequent delusion to travellers, appertains to the quality of
passion.

<span id="fn_1605"></span>[330:2](sbe0851.htm#fr_1612) I. e. the days of
the moon's conjunction or opposition.

<span id="fn_1606"></span>[330:3](sbe0851.htm#fr_1613) I understand this
to mean that in the 'immovable entities' the three qualities co-exist;
the birth in the lower species is an effect of darkness; the variable
qualities, viz. the heat, &c., as Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra says, are the
properties of passion; and the oleaginous properties among them
appertain to goodness, as, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, they are sources of
pleasure (cf. Gîtâ, [p. 118](sbe0819.htm#page_118)). Nîlaka*nth*a says,
'Immovable entities being very unintelligent, darkness is very much
developed among them,' but this last, as an interpretation of
tiryagbhâvagata, appears to me to be alike unwarranted and inappropriate
here.

<span id="fn_1607"></span>[330:4](sbe0851.htm#fr_1614) Does this mean
the period about the close of one and beginning of another yuga or age?
That is the only sense ejusdem generis with the words preceding it that
I can think of;--yet the jump from years to yuga-sandhis is a long one.

<span id="fn_1608"></span>[330:5](sbe0851.htm#fr_1615) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
120](sbe0819.htm#page_120). With reference to some, at least, of the
things enumerated here, the division would be rather fanciful.

<span id="fn_1609"></span>[331:1](sbe0851.htm#fr_1616) see these three
mentioned at *Kh*ândogya, pp. 340-359. As to departments of knowledge,
cf. Gîtâ, [p. 84](sbe0811.htm#page_84); Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra reads,
'threefold the Vedas.'

<span id="fn_1610"></span>[331:2](sbe0851.htm#fr_1617) The universe is
all developed from the Prakriti, which is merely the three 'qualities in
equilibrium.' Cf. Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sûtra I, 61.

<span id="fn_1611"></span>[331:3](sbe0851.htm#fr_1618) Because it gives
final emancipation to one who discriminates it from Purusha, Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra. Cf. Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sûtra II, 1 seq., and Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ,
p. 56 seq., and commentary. For another list of names of Prak*ri*ti, see
*S*vetâ*s*vatara (comm.), p. 283.

<span id="fn_1612"></span>[331:4](sbe0851.htm#fr_1619) Nature is not a
development from anything, and hence is called avik*ri*ti in
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ 3; but 'change' here probably means the whole
aggregate of Vik*ri*tis, 'changes' or developments, which make up
Prak*ri*ti; or by a different derivation it may, perhaps, also mean that
from which all development or change takes place.

<span id="fn_1613"></span>[331:5](sbe0851.htm#fr_1620) See
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sûtra V, 52-56; and also I, 26, and commentary here. The
Vedântins speak of Mâyâ--which answers to what the <span
id="page_332">p. 332</span> Sâ<u>n</u>khyas call Prak*ri*ti (see
*S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 340, and Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sûtra I, 69, and commentary
there)--as 'sattvâsattvâbhyâmanirvâ*k*ya.'
