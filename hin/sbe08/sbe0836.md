# CHAPTER IX.

The Brâhma*n*a said:

On this, too, they relate this ancient story, a dialogue between Nârada
and the sage Devamata.

Devamata said:

When a creature is about to be born, what comes into existence first,
his Prâ*n*a, or Apâna, or Samâna, or Vyâna, or else Udâna?

Nârada said:

By whichever the creature is produced, that which is other than this
first comes to him. And the pairs of the life-winds should be
understood, which (move) upwards, or downwards, or transversely.

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

Devamata said:

By which (of the life-winds) is a creature produced? and which (of them)
first comes to him? Explain to me also the pairs of the life-winds,
which (move) upwards, or downwards, or transversely.

Nârada said:

Pleasure is produced from a mental operation <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[1](#fn_1308), and (it.md) is also produced from a
sound, (it) is also produced from taste, and (it) is also produced from
colour, and (it) is also produced from touch, and (it) is also produced
from smell. This is the effect <span id="fr_1314"></span>[2](#fn_1309.md)
of the Udâna; the pleasure is produced from union <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[3](#fn_1310.md). From desire the semen is produced;
and from the semen is produced menstrual excretion. The semen and the
blood are produced by the Samâna and the Vyâna in common <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[4](#fn_1311.md). From the combination of the semen and
the blood, the Prâ*n*a comes first into operation; and the semen being
developed by the Prâ*n*a, the Apâna then comes into operation. The pair
Prâ*n*a and Apâna go upwards and downwards, and the Samâna and Vyâna are
called the pair (moving) transversely. It is the teaching of the

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Veda, that the fire verily is all the
deities <span id="fr_1317"></span>[1](#fn_1312), and knowledge (of it.md)
arises among Brâhma*n*as, being accompanied by intelligence <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[2](#fn_1313). The smoke of that (fire.md), which is of
excellent glory, (appears) in the shape of (the quality of) darkness;
(its) ashes, (the quality of) passion; and (the quality of) goodness is
that in connexion with it <span id="fr_1319"></span>[3](#fn_1314.md), in
which the offering is thrown. Those who understand the sacrifice
understand the Samâna and the Vyâna as the principal (offering). The
Prâ*n*a and Apâna are portions <span id="fr_1320"></span>[4](#fn_1315.md)
of the offering of clarified butter, and between them is the fire. That
is the excellent seat of the Udâna as understood by Brâhma*n*as <span
id="fr_1321"></span>[5](#fn_1316.md) As to that which is distinct from
these pairs <span id="fr_1322"></span>[6](#fn_1317.md), hear me speak about

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

that. Day and night are a pair, between them is the fire. That is the
excellent seat of the Udâna as understood by Brâhma*n*as. That which
exists and that which does not exist are a pair, between them is the
fire. That is the excellent seat of the Udâna as understood by
Brâhma*n*as. The two--good and evil--:are a pair, between them is the
fire. That is the excellent seat of the Udâna as understood by
Brâhma*n*as. First <span id="fr_1323"></span>[1](sbe0837.htm#fn_1318.md),
the Samâna and Vyâna, their function <span
id="fr_1324"></span>[2](sbe0837.htm#fn_1319.md) is performed: then,
secondly, the Samâna comes into operation again. Then the
Vâmadevya <span id="fr_1325"></span>[3](sbe0837.htm#fn_1320.md) for
tranquillity, and tranquillity is the eternal Brahman. This is the
excellent seat of the Udâna as understood by Brâhma*n*as.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1305"></span>[274:1](sbe0835.htm#fr_1310.md) This is not quite
clear. I presume it means that each one has the generic qualities which
make the others great in their own spheres; but the specific qualities
are different.

<span id="fn_1306"></span>[274:2](sbe0835.htm#fr_1311.md) The one life-wind
is supposed, here to be generally unmoving, but its distribution among
the different parts of the body as specified, for instance, in the
commentary on the Yoga-sûtra III, 38, gives it the different names. The
expression does not seem to be quite accurate for this, which
nevertheless seems to be the true, sense.

<span id="fn_1307"></span>[274:3](sbe0835.htm#fr_1312.md) Another reading
is, 'That one is my own self.' Cf. Maitrî, pp. 28 seq., 105, and
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka p. 169.

<span id="fn_1308"></span>[275:1](sbe0836.htm#fr_1313.md) I. e. desire.
'Sound' = recollection of a woman's voice; taste,' scil. of chastity;
'colour' = the beauty of a woman, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra Cf. Âpastamba I, 2,
7, 8, and Lalita Vistara, p. 19.

<span id="fn_1309"></span>[275:2](sbe0836.htm#fr_1314.md) Literally,
'form,' which Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra interprets to mean effect, and adds, 'The
Udâna causes mental activity, and by mental activity sound &c. are
apprehended.'

<span id="fn_1310"></span>[275:3](sbe0836.htm#fr_1315.md) I. e. of Udâna
and mind, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra; adding, 'the result is that a creature is
produced by the Udâna.'

<span id="fn_1311"></span>[275:4](sbe0836.htm#fr_1316.md) Or, perhaps,
generally, that is to say, the store of them, the specific semen being
produced from desire, as before stated. The Samâna's function is the
digestion of food, and that of the Vyâna is the distribution of the
digested food to the whole body through the nâ*d*îs, hence the
proposition in the text.

<span id="fn_1312"></span>[276:1](sbe0836.htm#fr_1317.md) Cf. inter alia,
Aitareya-brâhma*n*a (Haug's ed.), p. 1.

<span id="fn_1313"></span>[276:2](sbe0836.htm#fr_1318.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says intelligence means 'discussion, or argument.' The connexion of this
with what has gone before, according to Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, is this, that
the author having first stated the five Hot*ri*s fully, now explains in
what the Prâ*n*a and Apâna are to be offered up for acquiring the
Prâ*n*âyâma. The fire he takes to mean the self. Cf. what has been said
about Vaisvânara above, [p. 259](sbe0832.htm#page_259.md).

<span id="fn_1314"></span>[276:3](sbe0836.htm#fr_1319.md) That is to say,
the flame, 'take it. 'He is drawing out here the figure of the fire.

<span id="fn_1315"></span>[276:4](sbe0836.htm#fr_1320.md) These are only a
subordinate part of the offering, called Â*g*yabhâga. They are called
subordinate, I suppose, as the operations of the Samâna and Vyâna are
more practically important for vitality. The fire is the self. The place
of the principal offering is between the Â*g*yabhâgas, as stated by
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1316"></span>[276:5](sbe0836.htm#fr_1321.md) The Udâna is here
treated as the life-wind into which the others are to be offered up. See
[p. 258](sbe0832.htm#page_258), and note  [8](sbe0832.htm#fn_1232.md)
there.

<span id="fn_1317"></span>[276:6](sbe0836.htm#fr_1322.md) The next three
sentences seem to indicate what is to be destroyed in common with the
life-winds. One has to get rid of all notions about day and night, good
and evil, existence and non-existence, and then final emancipation is
reached. The fire, which is common to all the passages, stands for the
self; into that apparently all the ideas of time, and good and evil, and
so forth, are to be offered as the life-winds are; and that fire stands
in the place of <span id="page_277">p. 277</span> the Udâna, for this
purpose, as into the last all the other life-winds have to be offered.
As to that which exists, &c., cf. Gîtâ, [p. 103](sbe0815.htm#page_103.md),
and [p. 370](sbe0859.htm#page_370), note  [9](sbe0859.htm#fn_1909.md)
infra. As to good and evil and generally, cf. *Kh*ândogya, p. 60;
Kaushîtaki, p. 19. They are nothing to one who knows the Brahman. Day
and night Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra takes to mean the I*d*â and Pi<u>n</u>galâ
nâ*d*îs, between which is the Sushum*n*â, as they are connected with the
sun and moon. But the sense of the whole passage is far from clear.
