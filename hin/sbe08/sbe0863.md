# CHAPTER XXXVI.

Brahman said:

Since the mind is ruler of these five elements, in (the matter of)
absorbing or bringing (them) forth <span
id="fr_2007"></span>[6](#fn_1999.md),

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

the mind itself is the individual self <span
id="fr_2008"></span>[1](#fn_2000.md). The mind always presides over the
great elements. The understanding proclaims its power <span
id="fr_2009"></span>[2](#fn_2001.md), and it is called the Kshetra*g*ña.
The mind yokes the senses as a charioteer (yokes) good horses. The
senses, the mind, and the understanding are always joined to the
Kshetra*g*ña <span id="fr_2010"></span>[3](#fn_2002.md). That individual
self, mounting the chariot to which big horses <span
id="fr_2011"></span>[4](#fn_2003.md) are yoked, and in which the
understanding is the drag <span id="fr_2012"></span>[5](#fn_2004.md),
drives about on all sides. the great chariot which is pervaded by the
Brahman <span id="fr_2013"></span>[6](#fn_2005.md), has the group of the
senses yoked (to it), has the mind for a charioteer, and the
understanding for a drag. That learned and talented person verily, who
always understands thus the chariot pervaded by the Brahman, comes not
by delusion in the midst of all entities <span
id="fr_2014"></span>[7](#fn_2006.md). This forest of the Brahman <span
id="fr_2015"></span>[8](#fn_2007.md) begins with the unperceived, and ends
with the gross objects <span id="fr_2016"></span>[9](#fn_2008.md);

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

and includes movables and immovables, receives light from the radiance
of the sun and moon, is adorned with planets and nakshatras, and is
decked on all sides with nets of rivers and mountains, and always
beautified likewise by various (descriptions of) waters; it is (the
means of) subsistence for all entities <span
id="fr_2017"></span>[1](#fn_2009.md), and it is the goal of all living
creatures. In this the Kshetra*g*ña always moves about. Whatever
entities (there are) in this world, movable or immovable, they are the
very first <span id="fr_2018"></span>[2](#fn_2010.md) to be dissolved; and
next the developments produced from the elements <span
id="fr_2019"></span>[3](#fn_2011); and (after.md) these developments, all
the elements. Such is the upward gradation <span
id="fr_2020"></span>[4](#fn_2012.md) among entities. Gods, men, Gandharvas,
Pi*s*âkas, Asuras, Râkshasas, all have been created by nature <span
id="fr_2021"></span>[5](#fn_2013.md), not by actions, nor by a cause. These
Brâhma*n*as <span id="fr_2022"></span>[6](#fn_2014.md), the creators of the
world, are born here again and again. And whatever

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

is produced from them <span id="fr_2023"></span>[1](#fn_2015.md) is
dissolved in due time in those very five great elements, like billows in
the ocean. The great elements are in every way (beyond) the elements
that make up the world <span id="fr_2024"></span>[2](#fn_2016.md). And he
who is released, even from those five elements, goes to the highest
goal. The Lord Pra*g*âpati created all this by the mind <span
id="fr_2025"></span>[3](#fn_2017.md) only. And in the same manner <span
id="fr_2026"></span>[4](#fn_2018.md) the sages attained the godhead <span
id="fr_2027"></span>[5](#fn_2019.md) by means of penance <span
id="fr_2028"></span>[6](#fn_2020.md). And in like manner, those who have
achieved perfection, who have acquired concentration by a course of
penance, and who likewise feed on fruits and roots, perceive the triple
world <span id="fr_2029"></span>[7](#fn_2021.md) here by penance.
Medicines, and herbs, and the various sciences are all acquired <span
id="fr_2030"></span>[8](#fn_2022.md) by means of penance alone. For all
acquisition <span id="fr_2031"></span>[9](#fn_2023.md) has penance for its
root. Whatever is difficult to obtain <span
id="fr_2032"></span>[10](#fn_2024.md), difficult to

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

learn, difficult to vanquish, and difficult to pass through; all that
can be accomplished by penance, for penance is difficult to overcome.
One who drinks spirituous liquors, one who kills a Brâhma*n*a, one who
steals, one who destroys an embryo, one who violates the bed of his
preceptor <span id="fr_2033"></span>[1](#fn_2025.md), is released from,
that sin only by penance well performed. (Those) men, Pitris, gods,
(sacrificial) animals <span id="fr_2034"></span>[2](#fn_2026.md), beasts
and birds, and all other creatures movable or immovable, (who are)
constantly devoted to penance, always reach perfection by penance. And
in like manner the noble(-minded) gods went to heaven <span
id="fr_2035"></span>[3](#fn_2027.md). Those who without sloth perform
actions with expectations, and being full of egoism, they go near
Pra*g*âpati <span id="fr_2036"></span>[4](#fn_2028.md). Those high-souled
ones who are devoid of (the thought that this or that is) mine, and
devoid of egoism, by means of a pure concentration (of mind) on
contemplation, obtain the great and highest world. Those who best
understand the self, attaining concentration (of mind) on
contemplation <span id="fr_2037"></span>[5](#fn_2029.md), and having their
minds always tranquil, enter into the unperceived accumulation of
happiness <span id="fr_2038"></span>[6](#fn_2030.md). Those

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

who are free from (all thought that this or that is) mine, and who are
free from egoism, attaining concentration (of mind) on
contemplation <span id="fr_2039"></span>[1](#fn_2031.md), enter the highest
world of the great, which is the unperceived. Born from that same
unperceived <span id="fr_2040"></span>[2](#fn_2032) (principle.md), again
acquiring knowledge, and getting rid of the (qualities of) passion and
darkness, and resorting to the pure (quality of) goodness, a man gets
rid of all sins, and abandons everything as fruitless. He should be
understood to be the Kshetra*g*ña. He who understands him understands
the Vedas <span id="fr_2041"></span>[3](#fn_2033.md). Withdrawing from the
mind the objects <span id="fr_2042"></span>[4](#fn_2034.md) of mental
operations, a sage should sit down self-restrained. (He) necessarily
(becomes) that on which his mind <span id="fr_2043"></span>[5](#fn_2035.md)
(is fixed). This is the eternal mystery. That which begins with the
unperceived and ends with the gross objects <span
id="fr_2044"></span>[6](#fn_2036.md) is stated to be of the nature of
ignorance <span id="fr_2045"></span>[7](#fn_2037). But (you should.md)
learn that whose nature is devoid

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

of qualities. Two syllables <span id="fr_2046"></span>[1](#fn_2038.md) are
death; three syllables the eternal Brahman. Mine is death, and not mine
is the eternal <span id="fr_2047"></span>[2](#fn_2039.md). Some men of dull
understandings extol action. But as to the high-souled ancients they do
not extol action <span id="fr_2048"></span>[3](#fn_2040.md). By action a
creature is born with a body and made up of the sixteen <span
id="fr_2049"></span>[4](#fn_2041.md). Knowledge brings forth <span
id="fr_2050"></span>[5](#fn_2042.md) the being, and that is acceptable and
constitutes immortality. Therefore those who are far-sighted have no
attachment to actions. This being is stated to be full of knowledge, not
full of action <span id="fr_2051"></span>[6](#fn_2043.md). The
self-restrained man who thus understands the immortal, changeless,
incomprehensible, and ever indestructible and unattached (principle), he
dies not <span id="fr_2052"></span>[7](#fn_2044.md). He who thus
understands the self to which there is nothing prior, which is
uncreated, changeless, unmoving <span id="fr_2053"></span>[8](#fn_2045.md),
which is incomprehensible (even) to those who feed on nectar, he
certainly becomes immortal <span id="fr_2054"></span>[7](#fn_2044.md) and
not to be restrained <span id="fr_2055"></span>[9](#fn_2046.md), in
consequence of these means <span id="fr_2056"></span>[10](#fn_2047.md).

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

Expelling all impressions <span id="fr_2057"></span>[1](#fn_2048.md), and
restraining the self in the Self <span
id="fr_2058"></span>[2](#fn_2049.md), he understands that holy Brahman,
than which nothing greater exists. And when the understanding is clear,
he attains tranquillity <span id="fr_2059"></span>[3](#fn_2050.md). And the
nature of tranquillity is as when one sees a dream <span
id="fr_2060"></span>[4](#fn_2051.md). This <span
id="fr_2061"></span>[5](#fn_2052.md) is the goal of those emancipated ones
who are intent on knowledge. And they see all the movements <span
id="fr_2062"></span>[6](#fn_2053.md) which are produced by development.
This is the goal of those who are indifferent (to the world). This is
the eternal piety. This is what is acquired by men of knowledge. This is
the uncensured (mode of) conduct. This goal can be reached by one who is
alike to all beings <span id="fr_2063"></span>[7](#fn_2054.md), who is
without attachment, who is without expectations,

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

and who looks alike on everything <span
id="fr_2064"></span>[1](#fn_2055.md). I have now declared everything to
you, O best of Brâhma*n*a, sages! Act thus forthwith; then you will
acquire perfection.

The preceptor said:

Thus instructed by the preceptor Brahman, those high-souled sages acted
accordingly, and then attained to the worlds <span
id="fr_2065"></span>[2](#fn_2056.md). Do you, too, O noble person, of pure
self! duly act according to the words of Brahman which I have stated.
Then will you attain perfection.

Vâsudeva, said:

That pupil thus instructed in the highest piety by the preceptor, did
everything (accordingly), O son of Kuntî! and then attained final
emancipation. And the pupil, having done all he should have done,
attained to that seat, O supporter of the family of the Kauravas! going
to which one grieves not <span id="fr_2066"></span>[3](#fn_2057.md).

Ar*g*una said:

Who, indeed, was that Brâhma*n*a, O K*ri*sh*n*a! and who the pupil, O
*G*anârdana! If this verily, is fit to be heard by me, O Lord! then tell
it me.

Vâsudeva said:

I <span id="fr_2067"></span>[4](#fn_2058.md) am the preceptor, O you of
mighty arms! and

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

know the mind to be my pupil. And, O Dhanañ*g*aya! I have related this
mystery to you out of love for you. If you have love for me, O supporter
of the family of the Kauravas! then having heard this (instruction)
relating to the self, always duly act <span
id="fr_2068"></span>[1](#fn_2059) (according to it.md). Then when this
piety is duly practised, you will attain the absolute final
emancipation, getting rid of all sins. It was this same thing I stated
to you before <span id="fr_2069"></span>[2](#fn_2060.md) when the time for
battle had come, O you of mighty arms! Therefore fix your mind on this.
And now <span id="fr_2070"></span>[3](#fn_2061.md), O chief of the
descendants of Bharata! it is long since I saw the lord my father. I
wish to see him, with your consent, O Phâlguna <span
id="fr_2071"></span>[4](#fn_2062.md)!

Vai*s*ampâyana said,

When K*ri*sh*n*a spoke these words, Dhanañgaya replied (saying), 'O
K*ri*sh*n*a! let us verily go to-day to the city of Ga*g*asa <span
id="fr_2072"></span>[5](#fn_2063.md). Be pleased, O you who understand
piety! to see there king Yudhish*th*ira, who is of a devout heart, and
after taking leave of him to go to your own city.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1994"></span>[385:1](sbe0862.htm#fr_2002.md) This is the
Hindu. Gamut.

<span id="fn_1995"></span>[385:2](sbe0862.htm#fr_2003.md) These are not in
the *S*ânti Parvan; of many ingredients = collection of sounds, Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1996"></span>[385:3](sbe0862.htm#fr_2004.md) Being
all-pervading, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Cf. its position at Taittirîya, p. 67.

<span id="fn_1997"></span>[385:4](sbe0862.htm#fr_2005.md) Cf. Ka*th*a, pp.
114, 115, 149, and Sa<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya's commentary there, for an
explanation of the whole passage. And see Sâ<u>n</u>kya-sâra, p. 16, as
to what are here called self and understanding.

<span id="fn_1998"></span>[385:5](sbe0862.htm#fr_2006.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
64](sbe0807.htm#page_64.md), where the words are identical.

<span id="fn_1999"></span>[385:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2007.md) The elements are
perceived or are not perceived by the senses tinder the direction of the
mind; absorbing = destroying; bringing forth = producing, Nîlaka*nth*a.
See [p. 268](sbe0834.htm#page_268) supra, and *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha.md),
chap. 240, st. 12.

<span id="fn_2000"></span>[386:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2008.md) The word is the
same as at Maitrî, p. 41, the comment on which should be seen.

<span id="fn_2001"></span>[386:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2009.md) I. e. the mind 's
power is to be perceived by itself, Nîlaka*nth*a. The meaning seems to
be that the understanding can only operate on what the mind places
before it.

<span id="fn_2002"></span>[386:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2010.md) The passage at
Ka*th*a, p. 111 seq., and Sa<u>n</u>kara's commentary there, throw light
on this, though the figure is not drawn out in the same way in both
places. For a definition of Kshetra*g*ña, see *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha),
chap. 187, st. 23.

<span id="fn_2003"></span>[386:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2011.md) I. e. the senses.

<span id="fn_2004"></span>[386:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2012.md) I. e. that which
holds the horses in check. Nîlaka*nth*a seems to render it by 'whip,'
but that is not correct, I think.

<span id="fn_2005"></span>[386:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2013.md) So Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra. Nîlaka*nth*a says, 'The senses, &c., when they turn towards the
outer world make the self drive about, as an individual self; when
turned inwards they show him that he is the Brahman.' Nîlaka*nth*a thus
likens this to the Ka*th*a passage. See also p. 187 and notes there.

<span id="fn_2006"></span>[386:7](sbe0863.htm#fr_2014.md) Or it, may mean,
among all men.

<span id="fn_2007"></span>[386:8](sbe0863.htm#fr_2015.md) See [p.
164](sbe0824.htm#page_164) supra, note  [2](sbe0824.htm#fn_719.md); and [p.
295](sbe0841.htm#page_295), note  [4](sbe0841.htm#fn_1425.md).

<span id="fn_2008"></span>[386:9](sbe0863.htm#fr_2016.md) That is to say,
it includes all Sa*m*sâra, all the elements recognised by the
Sâ<u>n</u>khya philosophy, save the Being or Purusha.

<span id="fn_2009"></span>[387:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2017.md) Cf. [p.
371](sbe0859.htm#page_371.md) supra.

<span id="fn_2010"></span>[387:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2018.md) Another reading
means 'they are dissolved in the waters.' As to the order, cf. Vedânta
Paribhâshâ, p. 48, and [p. 335](sbe0854.htm#page_335.md) supra.

<span id="fn_2011"></span>[387:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2019.md) I take these to
mean the gross elements of which things movable and immovable may be
said to be made, if one may use a non-idealist phrase in the
Sâ<u>n</u>khya philosophy. Then the elements next spoken of are the
subtle ones or tanmâtras. Cf. the references in note  [2](#fn_2010.md). As
to developments, see [p. 382](sbe0862.htm#page_382.md), note
 [4](sbe0862.htm#fn_1983.md).

<span id="fn_2012"></span>[387:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2020.md) Viz. gross
object, gross element, subtle element.

<span id="fn_2013"></span>[387:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2021.md) The original is
svabhâva, which Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra renders by Prak*ri*ti. 'Actions' both
Nîlaka*nth*a and Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra take to mean sacrifices, &c., and
'cause' the former interprets by Brahman; the latter by tanmâtras or
subtle elements, and adds, 'the sense is not by sacrifice or tanmâtras
only.' Nîlaka*nth*a says, 'The gods, &c., are produced by nature, as the
gods, &c., seen in a dream.' The meaning seems to be that there are
energies in nature which evolve these forms of being. Cf. also Gîtâ, [p.
65](sbe0807.htm#page_65.md).

<span id="fn_2014"></span>[387:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2022.md) I presume this
means that the patriarchs (Marîki and others, says Nîlaka*nth*a) are
also born again and again--that is to say, in different kalpas, I
suppose--by nature only.

<span id="fn_2015"></span>[388:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2023.md) I think this must
mean the elements, though it might at first sight be referred to the
Brâhma*n*as.

<span id="fn_2016"></span>[388:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2024.md) I. e. the gross
elements, I take it; the others are. the tanmâtras.

<span id="fn_2017"></span>[388:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2025.md) I. e. the
meditation which constitutes true knowledge, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. But see
Gîtâ, [p. 87](sbe0812.htm#page_87), note  [1](sbe0812.htm#fn_346.md), and
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sûtra.

<span id="fn_2018"></span>[388:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2026.md) I. e. by the
mind, as to which cf. Taittirîya, p. 89; Ka*th*a, p. 164. Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra says, 'This apparent deviation from the ordinary modes of cause
and effect is not altogether without parallel, so he adds this to show
that.'

<span id="fn_2019"></span>[388:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2027.md) Literally, 'the
gods,' but the meaning seems to be that given in the text, as Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra says.

<span id="fn_2020"></span>[388:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2028.md) This is only the
concentration of mind and senses on one object, Nîlaka*nth*a. See [p.
166](sbe0824.htm#page_166), note  [1](sbe0824.htm#fn_737.md) supra.

<span id="fn_2021"></span>[388:7](sbe0863.htm#fr_2029.md) See [p.
174](sbe0824.htm#page_174.md) supra.

<span id="fn_2022"></span>[388:8](sbe0863.htm#fr_2030.md) Literally, 'are
accomplished,' which seems to mean that they are acquired so as to be
practically at one's command when required.

<span id="fn_2023"></span>[388:9](sbe0863.htm#fr_2031.md) The original word
is derived from the same root as the subject of the last note.

<span id="fn_2024"></span>[388:10](sbe0863.htm#fr_2032.md) Difficult to
obtain = the seat of Indra, &c.; to learn = Vedas, &c.; to vanquish =
fire. &c.; to pass through = a great deluge, &c., <span id="page_389">p.
389</span> Nîlaka*nth*a. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra seems to interpret the last
word, where his reading is doubtful, to mean 'difficult to do.'

<span id="fn_2025"></span>[389:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2033.md) Cf. *Kh*ândogya,
p. 361. Except the destruction of the embryo (see Taitt. Âra*n*. p. 870,
but at B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 795, Kaushîtaki, p. 77, and Âpastamba I,
6, 19, 16, the commentators render Bhrû*n*a by learned Brâhma*n*a), the
rest are the great sins. But note that stealing gold, not theft
generally, is mentioned as a great sin.

<span id="fn_2026"></span>[389:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2034.md) Or, perhaps,
cattle. The original is pa*s*u.

<span id="fn_2027"></span>[389:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2035.md) See [p.
160](sbe0823.htm#page_160.md) supra, and cf. [p.
178](sbe0825.htm#page_178.md).

<span id="fn_2028"></span>[389:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2036.md) I. e. Ka*s*yapa,
as gods, &c. This seems to be Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's interpretation. This
condition is inferior to that described in the following sentence.

<span id="fn_2029"></span>[389:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2037.md) See [p.
162](sbe0823.htm#page_162), note  [1](sbe0824.htm#fn_705.md).

<span id="fn_2030"></span>[389:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2038.md) Nîlaka*nth*a 's
rendering is 'that by which (worldly) happiness is <span
id="page_390">p. 390</span> heightened.' He compares B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka,
p. 816. See also Taittirîya, p. 112.

<span id="fn_2031"></span>[390:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2039.md) See Gîtâ, [p.
128](sbe0820.htm#page_128), note  [1](sbe0820.htm#fn_557.md), where dhyâna
and yoga are taken separately. Here the compound is in the singular.
Nîlaka*nth*a's reading is different.

<span id="fn_2032"></span>[390:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2040.md) The sense here is
not quite clear. It seems, however, to be this. The acquisitions
mentioned in the preceding sentence take the acquirers to some temporary
world from which they afterwards return; but when they get rid of the
qualities, they get final emancipation. As to the unperceived, cf. inter
alia Gîtâ, [p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112.md), note
 [2](sbe0817.htm#fn_470.md).

<span id="fn_2033"></span>[390:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2041.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.

That seems to approach the question from the opposite point of view.

<span id="fn_2034"></span>[390:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2042.md) So Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra. At Gîtâ XVI, 16, *k*itta means the operation itself. That also
will do here.

<span id="fn_2035"></span>[390:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2043.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
78](sbe0810.htm#page_78.md); Maitrî, p. 178; Pra*s*na, p. 194; and the
quotations at Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, p. 3.

<span id="fn_2036"></span>[390:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2044.md) This phrase has
occurred before; it means all the developments which make up worldly
life. See Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, p. 5.

<span id="fn_2037"></span>[390:7](sbe0863.htm#fr_2045.md) See [p.
371](sbe0859.htm#page_371.md) supra.

<span id="fn_2038"></span>[391:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2046.md) See *S*ânti
Parvan (Râ*g*adharma) XIII, 4. Cf. Maitrî, p. 180 This means the two and
three syllables of 'mama' and 'na mama,' mine and not mine. Cf.
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka p. 970, and *Kh*ândogya, p. 118, and p. 548, for a
similar conceit.

<span id="fn_2039"></span>[391:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2047.md) Final
emancipation follows on abandoning the idea of 'mine;' bondage on
harbouring it.

<span id="fn_2040"></span>[391:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2048.md) See Mu*nd*aka, p.
279.

<span id="fn_2041"></span>[391:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2049.md) The eleven organs
and the five great elements which go to form the body. See
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ 3, and comment thereon; *S*ânti Parvan, chap. 210,
st. 32 seq.; chap. 242, st. 7 seq.; Pra*s*na, p. 230.

<span id="fn_2042"></span>[391:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2050.md) I. e. shows.

<span id="fn_2043"></span>[391:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2051.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
118](sbe0819.htm#page_118.md); *S*ânti Parvan, ch. 242, st. 15.

<span id="fn_2044"></span>[391:7](sbe0863.htm#fr_2054.md) See [p.
367](sbe0858.htm#page_367) supra, note  [6](sbe0858.htm#fn_1875.md); and
cf. Ka*th*a, pp. 155, 156.

<span id="fn_2045"></span>[391:8](sbe0863.htm#fr_2053.md) I. e. which
remains unconcerned, cf. Î*s*a, p. 10. Apûrvam (to which there is
nothing prior), Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra renders by 'not familiarly known,' and
Nîlaka*nth*a by 'not understood by any other means of knowledge.' See
also B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 502, and *S*a<u>n</u>kara on that.

<span id="fn_2046"></span>[391:9](sbe0863.htm#fr_2055.md) This is not very
clear, but I suppose the meaning to be the same as that of
'unconquerable' at [p. 161](sbe0823.htm#page_161.md), and see [p.
231](sbe0828.htm#page_231.md).

<span id="fn_2047"></span>[391:10](sbe0863.htm#fr_2056.md) I. e. the means
mentioned further on, says Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_2048"></span>[392:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2057.md) Impressions from
external causes. Cf. inter alia Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sûtra III, 83; see, too,
pp. [247](sbe0831.htm#page_247)-[358](sbe0857.htm#page_358.md) supra and
notes there.

<span id="fn_2049"></span>[392:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2058.md) I. e. restraining
the mind in the lotus-like heart, Nîlaka*nth*a. Cf. as to this, pp.
[248](sbe0831.htm#page_248), [372](sbe0859.htm#page_372.md) inter alia.

<span id="fn_2050"></span>[392:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2059.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
51](sbe0804.htm#page_51.md). See also Maitrî-upanishad, p. 176, and
Mu*nd*aka, p. 314.

<span id="fn_2051"></span>[392:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2060.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says, 'The nature of tranquillity is this, that in that state you
perceive everything to be unreal like what is seen in a dream'
Nîlaka*nth*a says, 'The nature of tranquillity is this, that in that
state the self abides without attachment to the body and any external
objects, but working within itself as in a dream.' But see on this
Ka*th*a, p. 147.

<span id="fn_2052"></span>[392:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2061.md) Viz.
tranquillity, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_2053"></span>[392:6](sbe0863.htm#fr_2062.md) I. e., says
Nîlaka*nth*a, they see all worldly objects past and future. Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra, 'They see the actions performed for some wealth and so forth.'
I am not satisfied with either meaning. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's is besides
based on a reading different from that adopted in the text, namely,
Parimâ*n*a*g*âh, instead of Pari*n*âma*g*âh. I think 'pari*n*âma' is the
development which, according to the Sâ<u>n</u>khya philosophy, produces
the universe, and the movements are the actions which that
development--namely, here the activity of egoism and its
products--occasions. Cf. as to some extent supporting this,
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, p. 16.

Bhûr and the rest. But see also *Kh*ândogya, pp. 212, 541, 620, and
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, pp. 302, 608.

<span id="fn_2058"></span>[393:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2067.md) e. I, the
Kshetragña, am the preceptor, and the mind is that which has to be
taught. This shows that one's instructor must be oneself, Nîlaka*nth*a.
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra says, 'I am the preceptor, the mind is the pupil. The
meaning of this is that anybody who has not acquired knowledge is
treated here as a pupil; there is no other special pupil intended.' Cf.
also [p. 310](sbe0846.htm#page_310.md), supra.

<span id="fn_2059"></span>[394:1](sbe0863.htm#fr_2068.md) Nîlaka*nth*a
interprets the words without supplying anything, thus 'be devoted to
yama niyama,' &c. Yama &c. are the eight requisites for Yoga or
concentration of mind as taught by Patañ*g*ali.

<span id="fn_2060"></span>[394:2](sbe0863.htm#fr_2069.md) That is to say,
in the Gîtâ.

<span id="fn_2061"></span>[394:3](sbe0863.htm#fr_2070.md) Here he takes up
the thread of the story. In the first chapter it was hinted that
K*ri*sh*n*a was anxious to go to Dvârakâ.

<span id="fn_2062"></span>[394:4](sbe0863.htm#fr_2071.md) This is a name of
Ar*g*una.

<span id="fn_2063"></span>[394:5](sbe0863.htm#fr_2072.md) I. e. Hastinâpur,
the capital of the Pândavas. They were, when the dialogue was held, at
Indraprastha. See [p. 229](sbe0828.htm#page_229.md) supra.
