<P>What conversation, O twice-born one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1033"></A><A HREF="#fn_1028"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> I took place between the high-souled Kesava and Ar<I>g</I>una, while they dwelt in that palace &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1034"></A><A HREF="#fn_1029"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> after slaying their enemies?</P>

<P>The son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;, after becoming possessed of his kingdom (in an) undisturbed (state), enjoyed himself in the company of K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a, full of delight in that heavenly palace. And once, O king! they happened to go, surrounded by their people, and rejoicing, to a certain portion of the palace which resembled heaven. Then Ar<I>g</I>una, the son of P&acirc;<I>nd</I>u, having surveyed with delight that lovely palace, in the company of K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a, spoke these words: 'O you of mighty arms! O you whose mother is Devak&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1035"></A><A HREF="#fn_1030"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>! when the battle was about to commence, I became aware of your greatness, and that divine</P>

But that, O Kesava! which through affection (for me) you explained before&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1037"></A><A HREF="#fn_1032"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, has all disappeared, O tiger-like man! from my degenerate mind. Again and again, however, I feel a curiosity about those topics. But (now), O M&acirc;dhava! you will be going at no distant date to Dv&acirc;rak&acirc;.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Vai<I>s</I>amp&acirc;yana said</P>
<P>Thus addressed, that best of speakers, K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a, possessed of great glory, replied in these words after embracing Ar<I>g</I>una.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">V&acirc;sudeva said:</P>
<P>From me, O son of Prith&acirc;! you heard a mystery, and learnt about the eternal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1038"></A><A HREF="#fn_1033"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (principle), about piety in (its true) form, and about all the everlasting worlds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1039"></A><A HREF="#fn_1034"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. It is excessively disagreeable to me, that you should not have grasped it through want of intelligence. And the recollection (of it) now again is not possible (to me). Really, O son of P&acirc;ndu! you are devoid of faith and of a bad intellect. And, O Dhana&ntilde;<I>g</I>aya! it is not possible for me to repeat in full (what I said before). For that doctrine was perfectly adequate for understanding the seat,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1040"></A><A HREF="#fn_1035"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> of the Brahman. It is not possible for me to state it again in full in that way. For then accompanied by my mystic power&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1041"></A><A HREF="#fn_1036"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, I declared to you the Supreme Brahman. But I shall relate an ancient story upon</P>

<P>that subject, so that adhering to this knowledge, you may attain the highest goal. O best of the supporters of piety! listen to all that I say. (Once), O restrainer of foes! there came from the heavenly world and the world of Brahman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1042"></A><A HREF="#fn_1037"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a difficult to withstand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1043"></A><A HREF="#fn_1038"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and he was (duly) honoured by us. (Now) listen, without entertaining any misgivings, O chief of the descendants of Bharata! O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! to what he said on being interrogated by us according to heavenly rules&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1044"></A><A HREF="#fn_1039"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>The Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a said:</P>

I will explain to you accurately what you, out of compassion for (all) beings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1045"></A><A HREF="#fn_1040"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, have asked me touching the duties (to be Performed) for final emancipation.

A certain Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a named K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa, who had performed (much) penance, and who best understood piety, approached a certain twice-born. (person) who had learnt the Scriptures relating to (all) duties&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1047"></A><A HREF="#fn_1042"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, having heard (of him, as one) who had over and over again gone through all knowledge and experience about coming and going&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1048"></A><A HREF="#fn_1043"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, who was well versed in the true nature of all worlds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1049"></A><A HREF="#fn_1044"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>,</P>

Nowhere is there everlasting happiness; nowhere eternal residence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1060"></A><A HREF="#fn_1055"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Over and over again is there a downfall from a high position attained with difficulty. Overcome by lust and anger, and deluded by desire, I fell into uncomfortable and harassing states (of life), in-consequence of (my) committing sin. Again and again death, and again and again birth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1061"></A><A HREF="#fn_1056"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. I ate numerous (kinds of) food, sucked at various breasts, saw various mothers, and fathers of different sorts; and, O sinless one! (I saw) strange pleasures and miseries. Frequently (I suffered) separation from those I loved, association with those I did not love. Loss of wealth also came on me, after I had acquired that wealth with difficulty; ignominies full of affliction from princes and likewise from kinsmen; excessively poignant pain, mental and bodily. I also underwent frightful indignities, and fierce deaths and captivities; (I had a) fall into hell, and torments in the house of Yama&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1062"></A><A HREF="#fn_1057"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. I also suffered much from old age, continual ailments, and numerous misfortunes flowing from the pairs of opposites&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1063"></A><A HREF="#fn_1058"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.
