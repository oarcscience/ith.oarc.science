<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a said:</P>
<P>On this, too, they relate this ancient story, a dialogue between N&acirc;rada and the sage Devamata.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Devamata said:</P>
<P>When a creature is about to be born, what comes into existence first, his Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, or Ap&acirc;na, or Sam&acirc;na, or Vy&acirc;na, or else Ud&acirc;na?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">N&acirc;rada said:</P>
<P>By whichever the creature is produced, that which is other than this first comes to him. And the pairs of the life-winds should be understood, which (move) upwards, or downwards, or transversely.</P>

<P>By which (of the life-winds) is a creature produced? and which (of them) first comes to him? Explain to me also the pairs of the life-winds, which (move) upwards, or downwards, or transversely.</P>

<P>Pleasure is produced from a mental operation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1313"></A><A HREF="#fn_1308"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and (it) is also produced from a sound, (it) is also produced from taste, and (it) is also produced from colour, and (it) is also produced from touch, and (it) is also produced from smell.

From the combination of the semen and the blood, the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a comes first into operation; and the semen being developed by the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, the Ap&acirc;na then comes into operation. The pair Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a and Ap&acirc;na go upwards and downwards, and the Sam&acirc;na and Vy&acirc;na are called the pair (moving) transversely. It is the teaching of the</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1305"></A><A HREF="sbe0835.htm#fr_1310">274:1</A> This is not quite clear. I presume it means that each one has the generic qualities which make the others great in their own spheres; but the specific qualities are different.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1306"></A><A HREF="sbe0835.htm#fr_1311">274:2</A> The one life-wind is supposed, here to be generally unmoving, but its distribution among the different parts of the body as specified, for instance, in the commentary on the Yoga-s&ucirc;tra III, 38, gives it the different names. The expression does not seem to be quite accurate for this, which nevertheless seems to be the true, sense.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1307"></A><A HREF="sbe0835.htm#fr_1312">274:3</A> Another reading is, 'That one is my own self.' Cf. Maitr&icirc;, pp. 28 seq., 105, and B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka p. 169.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1308"></A><A HREF="sbe0836.htm#fr_1313">275:1</A> I. e. desire. 'Sound' = recollection of a woman's voice; taste,' scil. of chastity; 'colour' = the beauty of a woman, Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra Cf. &Acirc;pastamba I, 2, 7, 8, and Lalita Vistara, p. 19.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1309"></A><A HREF="sbe0836.htm#fr_1314">275:2</A> Literally, 'form,' which Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra interprets to mean effect, and adds, 'The Ud&acirc;na causes mental activity, and by mental activity sound &amp;c. are apprehended.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1310"></A><A HREF="sbe0836.htm#fr_1315">275:3</A> I. e. of Ud&acirc;na and mind, Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra; adding, 'the result is that a creature is produced by the Ud&acirc;na.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1311"></A><A HREF="sbe0836.htm#fr_1316">275:4</A> Or, perhaps, generally, that is to say, the store of them, the specific semen being produced from desire, as before stated. The Sam&acirc;na's function is the digestion of food, and that of the Vy&acirc;na is the distribution of the digested food to the whole body through the n&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;s, hence the proposition in the text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1312"></A><A HREF="sbe0836.htm#fr_1317">276:1</A> Cf. inter alia, Aitareya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (Haug's ed.), p. 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1313"></A><A HREF="sbe0836.htm#fr_1318">276:2</A> Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra says intelligence means 'discussion, or argument.' The connexion of this with what has gone before, according to Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra, is this, that the author having first stated the five Hot<I>ri</I>s fully, now explains in what the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a and Ap&acirc;na are to be offered up for acquiring the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;y&acirc;ma. The fire he takes to mean the self. Cf. what has been said about Vaisv&acirc;nara above, <A HREF="sbe0832.htm#page_259">p. 259</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1314"></A><A HREF="sbe0836.htm#fr_1319">276:3</A> That is to say, the flame, 'take it. 'He is drawing out here the figure of the fire.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1315"></A><A HREF="sbe0836.htm#fr_1320">276:4</A> These are only a subordinate part of the offering, called &Acirc;<I>g</I>yabh&acirc;ga. They are called subordinate, I suppose, as the operations of the Sam&acirc;na and Vy&acirc;na are more practically important for vitality. The fire is the self. The place of the principal offering is between the &Acirc;<I>g</I>yabh&acirc;gas, as stated by Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1316"></A><A HREF="sbe0836.htm#fr_1321">276:5</A> The Ud&acirc;na is here treated as the life-wind into which the others are to be offered up. See <A HREF="sbe0832.htm#page_258">p. 258</A>, and note &nbsp;<A HREF="sbe0832.htm#fn_1232"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> there.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1317"></A><A HREF="sbe0836.htm#fr_1322">276:6</A> The next three sentences seem to indicate what is to be destroyed in common with the life-winds. One has to get rid of all notions about day and night, good and evil, existence and non-existence, and then final emancipation is reached. The fire, which is common to all the passages, stands for the self; into that apparently all the ideas of time, and good and evil, and so forth, are to be offered as the life-winds are; and that fire stands in the place of <A NAME="page_277"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 277</FONT></A> the Ud&acirc;na, for this purpose, as into the last all the other life-winds have to be offered. As to that which exists, &amp;c., cf. G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0815.htm#page_103">p. 103</A>, and <A HREF="sbe0859.htm#page_370">p. 370</A>, note &nbsp;<A HREF="sbe0859.htm#fn_1909"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> infra. As to good and evil and generally, cf. <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya, p. 60; Kaush&icirc;taki, p. 19. They are nothing to one who knows the Brahman. Day and night Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra takes to mean the I<I>d</I>&acirc; and Pi<U>n</U>gal&acirc; n&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;s, between which is the Sushum<I>n</I>&acirc;, as they are connected with the sun and moon. But the sense of the whole passage is far from clear.</P>
