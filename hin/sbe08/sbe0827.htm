<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION TO ANUG&Icirc;T&Acirc;.</H1>
<P>LIKE the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc; and the Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;t&icirc;ya, the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, is one of the numerous episodes of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata. And like the Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;t&icirc;ya, it appears here for the first time in an English, or, indeed, it is believed, in any European garb. It forms part of the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, and is contained in thirty-six chapters of that Parvan. These chapters--being chapters XVI to LI--together with all the subsequent chapters of the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan, form by themselves what in some of our copies is called the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; Parvan-a title which affords a parallel to the title Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc; Parvan, which we have already referred to. The Anug&icirc;t&acirc; is not now a work of any very great or extensive reputation. But we do find some few quotations from it in the Bh&acirc;shyas of Sa<U>n</U>kar&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya, and one or two in the Sa<U>n</U>khya-s&acirc;ra of Vi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na Bhikshu, to which reference will be made hereafter. And it is included in the present volume, partly because it affords an interesting, glimpse of sundry old passages of the Upanishad literature in a somewhat modified, and presumably later, form; and partly, perhaps I may say more especially, because it professes to be a sort of continuation, or rather recapitulation, of the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;. At the very outset of the work, we read, that, after the great fratricidal war of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata was over, and the P&acirc;<I>nd</I>avas had become sole and complete masters of their ancestral kingdom, K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a and Ar<I>g</I>una--the two interlocutors in the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;--happened to take a stroll together in the great magical palace built for the P&acirc;<I>nd</I>avas by the demon Maya. In the course of the conversation which they held on the occasion, K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a communicated to Ar<I>g</I>una his wish to return to his own people at Dv&acirc;rak&acirc;, now that the business which had called</P>
<P><A NAME="page_198"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 198</FONT></A></P>
<P>him away from them was happily terminated. Ar<I>g</I>una, of course, was unable to resist the execution of this wish; but he requested Krishna, before leaving for Dv&acirc;rak&acirc;, to repeat the instruction which had been already conveyed to him on 'the holy field of Kurukshetra,' but which had gone out of his 'degenerate mind.' K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a thereupon protests that he is not equal to a verbatim recapitulation of the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;, but agrees, in lieu of that, to impart to Ar<I>g</I>una the same instruction in other words, through the medium of a certain 'ancient story'--or pur&acirc;tana itih&acirc;sa. And the instruction thus conveyed constitutes what is called the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, a name which is in itself an embodiment of this anecdote.</P>
<P>Now the first question which challenges investigation with reference to this work is, if we may so call it, the fundamental one-how much is properly included under the name? The question is not one quite easy of settlement, as our authorities upon it are not all reconcilable with one another. In the general list of contents of the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan, which is given at the end of that Parvan in the edition printed at Bombay, we read that the first section is the Vy&acirc;sa V&acirc;kya, the second the Samvartamarutt&icirc;ya. With neither of these have we aught to do here. The list then goes on thus: 'Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, V&acirc;sudev&acirc;gamana, Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a G&icirc;t&acirc;, Guru<I>s</I>ishyasamv&acirc;da, Uttankop&acirc;khy&acirc;na,' and so forth. With the later sections, again, we arc not here concerned. Now let us compare this list with the list which may be obtained from the titles of the chapters in the body of the work itself. With the sixteenth chapter, then, of the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan, begins what is here called the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; Parvan; and that chapter and the three following chapters are described as the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth chapters respectively of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; Parvan, which forms part of the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan. The title of the twentieth chapter contains a small, but important, addition. It runs thus, 'Such is the twentieth chapter of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; Parvan, forming part of the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan--being the Brahma G&icirc;t&acirc;' This form is continued down to the thirty-fourth chapter, only Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a</P>
<P><A NAME="page_199"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 199</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> G&icirc;t&acirc; being substituted for Brahma G&icirc;t&acirc;. At the close of the thirty-fifth chapter, there is another alteration caused by the substitution of Guru<I>s</I>ishyasamv&acirc;da for Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a G&icirc;t&acirc;; and this continues down to the fifty-first chapter, where the thread of the narrative is again taken up--the philosophical parenthesis, if I may so say, having come to an end. With the fifty-first chapter our present translation also ends. Now it appears from the above comparison., that the list of contents set out above is accurate, save in so far as it mentions V&acirc;sudev&acirc;gamana as a distinct section of the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan. No such section seems to be in existence. And there appears to be nothing in the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan to which that title could be appropriately allotted. The edition printed at Madras agrees in all essential particulars with the Bombay edition; with this difference, that even at the close of the twentieth chapter, the name is Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a G&icirc;t&acirc;, and not Brahma G&icirc;t&acirc; as it is in the Bombay edition. The Calcutta edition also agrees in these readings. Turning now to a MS. procured for me by my excellent friend Professor &Acirc;b&acirc;<I>g</I>&icirc; Vish<I>n</I>u K&acirc;thava<I>t</I>e at Ahmedabad, and bearing date the 15th of Ph&acirc;lguna Vadya 1823, Sunday, we find there at the end of the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan a list of contents like that which we have seen in the printed edition. The relevant portion of that list is as follows: 'Samvartamarutt&icirc;ya, Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, Guru<I>s</I>ishyasa<I>m</I>v&acirc;da, and Uttankop&acirc;khy&acirc;na.' Here we find neither the erroneous entry of V&acirc;sudev&acirc;gamana, nor the correct entry of Brahma G&icirc;t&acirc;, which are both contained in the other list. In another MS. which I have now before me, and which has been lent me by Professor Bh&acirc;<I>nd</I>&acirc;rkar, who purchased it in Puna for the Government of Bombay--in this MS., which contains the commentary of Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra, the earlier chapters are described not as chapters of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; Parvan, but of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; contained in the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan, and they are numbered there as they are numbered in our translation, not continuously with the numbering of the previous chapters of the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan. At the close of chapter IV, we have an explicit statement that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; ends there. Then the Brahma G&icirc;t&acirc; begins. And the first chapter is</P>
<P><A NAME="page_200"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 200</FONT></A></P>
<P>described as a chapter of the Brahma G&icirc;t&acirc; in the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan. The numbering of each of these chapters of the Brahma G&icirc;t&acirc; is not given in. the copy before us--the titles and descriptions of the various chapters being throughout incomplete. Some of the later chapters are described as chapters of the Br&acirc;hma G&icirc;t&acirc;, and some as chapters of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a G&icirc;t&acirc;; but this discrepancy is probably to be put to the account of the particular copyist who wrote out the copy used by us. With what is chapter XX in our numbering the Guru<I>s</I>ishyasa<I>m</I>v&acirc;da begins. This MS. omits all reference to any Anug&icirc;t&acirc; Parvan, and fails to number the various chapters. Its list of sections agrees with that in the Bombay edition. It bears no date.</P>
<P>So much for what may be described as our primary sources of information on this subject. Let us now glance at the secondary sources. And, first, N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a in commenting on what is, according to his numbering, chapter XV, stanza 43, apparently distinguishes that chapter from what he speaks of as the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a G&icirc;t&acirc; and Guru<I>s</I>ishyasa<I>m</I>v&acirc;da, which he implies follow after that chapter--thus indicating that he accepted in substance the tradition re corded in the passages We have already set forth, viz. that the first four chapters of our translation form the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, the next fifteen the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a G&icirc;t&acirc;, and the last seventeen the Guru<I>s</I>ishyasa<I>m</I>v&acirc;da. This is also the view of Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra. At the close of his gloss on chapter IV, he distinctly states that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; ends at that chapter; and again at the close of the gloss on chapter XIX, he explicitly says that the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a G&icirc;t&acirc; ends there. He also adds the following interesting observation: 'The feminine form (G&icirc;t&acirc;, namely) is used in consequence of (the word) Upanishad being feminine.' The full title of that part of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata would then be, according to this remark of Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra, 'the Upanishads sung by the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a,' a title parallel to that of the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;, 'the Upanishads sung by the Deity.' It is to be further remarked, that the last chapter of the Guru<I>s</I>ishyasa<I>m</I>v&acirc;da is called in this commentary the eighteenth chapter of the Guru<I>s</I>ishyasa<I>m</I>v&acirc;da, a fact which seems to indicate that Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra either found</P>
<P><A NAME="page_201"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 201</FONT></A></P>
<P>in the MS. which he used, or himself established, a separate numbering for the chapters in the several sections&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_983"></A><A HREF="#fn_978"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of which the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan is made up.</P>
<P>Although the information here set out from these various sources is not easily to be harmonised in all its parts, the preponderance of testimony seems to he in favour of regarding the portion of the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan embraced in our translation as containing three distinct sections, viz. the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a G&icirc;t&acirc;, and the Guru<I>s</I>ishyasa<I>m</I>v&acirc;da. And some indirect support may be derived for this conclusion, from one or two other circumstances. In the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-s&acirc;ra of Vi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na Bhikshu--a work which, as we shall see in the sequel, expressly mentions the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;--we have a passage cited as from the 'Bh&acirc;rata&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_984"></A><A HREF="#fn_979"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>' which coincides almost precisely with a passage occurring at chapter XXVII of our translation (see p. 335). And, in the Bh&acirc;shya of <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kar&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya, on the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;, chapter XV, stanza 1, we have a citation as from a 'Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a' of a passage which coincides pretty closely with one which occurs at chapter XX of our translation (see <A HREF="sbe0847.htm#page_313">p. 313</A>). If the discrepancies between the quotations as given by Vi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na Bhikshu and <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara, and the passages occurring in our text, may be treated merely as various readings-and there is nothing inherently improbable in this being the case-it may be fairly contended, that neither <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara nor Vi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na Bhikshu would have used the vague expressions, 'a Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a,' or even 'the Bh&acirc;rata,' if they could have correctly substituted in lieu of them the specific name Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. And this, it may be said, is a contention of some weight, when it is remembered, that both <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara and Vi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na show, in other parts of their writings, an acquaintance with this very Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. If this reasoning is correct,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_202"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 202</FONT></A></P>
<P>the conclusion to be derived from it must be, that <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara and Vi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na must have considered the chapters of the A<I>s</I>vamedha Parvan from which their respective quotations are taken as not forming part of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;.</P>
<P>The testimony we have thus collected is apparently of considerable weight. Against it, however, we have to weigh some testimony which appears to me to be entitled, upon the whole, to even greater weight. In the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-s&acirc;ra of Vi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na Bhikshu, to which we have already referred, we have two quotations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_985"></A><A HREF="#fn_980"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> from the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; which are distinctly stated to be taken from that work. The first occurs in our translation at <A HREF="sbe0852.htm#page_332">p. 332</A>, the second at <A HREF="sbe0847.htm#page_313">p. 313</A>. Now, if we adopt the conclusion above referred to, regarding the correct titles of the thirty-six chapters which we have translated, it is a mistake to attribute the passages in question to the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. They would, on that view, form part of the Guru<I>s</I>ishyasa<I>m</I>v&acirc;da. Again, in his commentary on the Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;t&icirc;ya, <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara refers to sundry passages which he expressly says are taken from the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, but which are not contained in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; as limited by the evidence we have considered above. One of the passages referred to is taken from chapter XI of our translation, and others are contained in the comments on Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;t&icirc;ya I, 6, and on I, 20 and I, 41&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_986"></A><A HREF="#fn_981"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. It is difficult to resist the conclusion to which this positive evidence leads. One cannot possibly explain this evidence upon the view which we have first stated; while, on the other hand, the points which apparently support that view are capable of some explanation on the theory that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; includes all the chapters here translated. And that in this wise. The passages which we have referred to as cited by <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara and Vi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na from a Pur&acirc;na and from the Bh&acirc;rata may have been actually taken from some other work than the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. Even waiving the fact that the readings are different,--though in regard especially to the quotation given by <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara it is not one to be entirely lost sight of,--there is this fact which is of great and almost conclusive weight on such a point as this, namely, that we</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_203"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 203</FONT></A></P>
<P>have many instances of passages common, almost verbatim et literatim, to the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata and other works. For one instance, take the very passage on which a chronological argument has been founded by us in the Introduction to the Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;t&icirc;ya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_987"></A><A HREF="#fn_982"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It ought to have been there pointed out, that the stanza about a young man being bound to rise to receive an elderly person, also occurs in the Manu Sm<I>ri</I>ti&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_988"></A><A HREF="#fn_983"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in exactly the same words. The omission to note this circumstance in its proper place in the Introduction to the Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;t&icirc;ya was due to a mere inadvertence. But the conclusion there hinted at was expressed in very, cautious language, and with many qualifications, out of regard to circumstances such as those which we are now considering. Similar repetitions may be pointed out in other places. The passage about the Kshetra<I>g</I>&ntilde;a and Sattva and their mutual relations (see <A HREF="sbe0860.htm#page_374">p. 374</A>) occurs, as pointed out in the note there,. in at least two other places in the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata. The passage likewise which occurs at G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0815.htm#page_103">p. 103</A>, about the 'hands, feet, &amp;c., on all sides,' is one which may be seen, to my own knowledge, in about half a dozen places in the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata. Such cases, I believe, may be easily multiplied; and they illustrate and are illustrated by Mr. Freeman's proposition respecting the epic age in Greece, to which we have already alluded. It follows, consequently, that the quotations from <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara and Vi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na, to which we have referred above, do not militate very strongly against the final conclusion at which we have arrived. The testimony of the MSS. and the commentators is, no doubt, of considerably greater force. But N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, whatever his merits as an exegete--and even these are often marred by a persistent effort to read his own foregone conclusions into the text he comments on N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a is but an indifferent authority in the domain of historical criticism. In his commentary on the Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;t&icirc;ya, for instance, he tells us that he has admitted into his text sundry verses which were not in the copy used by <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara, and for which he had none but a very modern voucher, and he very naively adds that he has done so</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_204"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 204</FONT></A></P>
<P>on the principle of collecting all good things to a focus. Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra is a very much more satisfactory commentator. But he is not likely to be a writer of much antiquity. I assume, that he must be more recent than Sa<U>n</U>kar&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya, though I cannot say that I have any very tenable ground for the assumption. But assuming that, I think it more satisfactory to adopt Sa<U>n</U>kar&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya's nomenclature, and to treat the thirty-six chapters here translated as constituting the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. It is not improbable, if our assumption is correct, that the division of the thirty-six chapters in the manner we have seen may have come into vogue after the date of Vi<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na Bhikshu, who, according to Dr. F. E. Hall, 'lived in all probability in the sixteenth or seventeenth century, and whom there is some slight reason for carrying back still further&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_989"></A><A HREF="#fn_984"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</P>
<P>Do these thirty-six chapters, then, form one integral work? Are they all the work of one and the same author? These are the questions which next present themselves for consideration. The evidence bearing upon them, however, is, as might be expected, excessively scanty. Of external evidence, indeed, we have really none, barring<I> S</I>a<U>n</U>kara's statement in his commentary on the B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka-upanishad&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_990"></A><A HREF="#fn_985"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> that the verse which he there quotes from the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; has Vy&acirc;sa for its author. That statement indicates that <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara accepted the current tradition of Vy&acirc;sa's authorship of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;; and such acceptance, presumably, followed from his acceptance of the tradition of Vy&acirc;sa's authorship of the entire Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata. If that tradition is incorrect, and Vy&acirc;sa is not the author of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, we have no means of ascertaining who is the author. And as to the tradition in question, it is difficult, in the present state of our materials, to form any satisfactory judgment. We therefore proceed at once to consider whether the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; is really one work. And I must admit at the outset that I find it difficult to answer this question. There are certainly some circumstances connected with the work which might be regarded as indicating</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_205"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 205</FONT></A></P>
<P>a different authorship of different parts of it. Thus in an early portion of the work, we find the first personal pronoun is used, where the Supreme Being is evidently intended to be signified, and yet the passage is not put into the mouth of K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a, but of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. A similar passage occurs a little later on also. Now it must be taken to be a somewhat strained interpretation of the words used in the passages in question to suppose that the speaker there used the first personal pronoun, identifying himself for the nonce with the Supreme Being&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_991"></A><A HREF="#fn_986"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Again, in a passage still further on, we have the vocative O P&acirc;rtha! where the person addressed is not Ar<I>g</I>una at all, but the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a's wife. Now these lapses are susceptible of two explanations--either we are to see in them so many cases of 'Homer nodding,' or we may suppose that they are errors occasioned by one writer making additions to the work of a previous writer, without a vivid recollection of the framework of the original composition into which his own work had to be set&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_992"></A><A HREF="#fn_987"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. I own, that on balancing the probabilities on the one side and the other, my mind rather leans to the hypothesis of one author making a slip in the plexus of his own story within story, rather than the hypothesis of a deliberate interpolator forgetting the actual scheme of the original work into which he was about to foist his own additions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_993"></A><A HREF="#fn_988"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. And this the rather, that we find a similar slip towards the very beginning of the work, where we have the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa addressed as Parantapa, or destroyer of foes--an epithet which, I think, is exclusively reserved for Kshatriyas, and is, in any case, a very inappropriate one to apply to a humble seeker for spiritual light. This slip appears to me to be incapable of explanation on any theory of interpolation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_994"></A><A HREF="#fn_989"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. And hence the other slips above noted can hardly be regarded as supporting any such theory. Another circumstance, not indeed bearing</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_206"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 206</FONT></A></P>
<P>out that theory, but rendering interpolations possible, deserves to be noted. The scheme of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; certainly lends itself to interpolations. A story might without much difficulty be added to the series of story joined to story which it contains. Against this, however, it must not be forgotten, that the <I>S</I>&acirc;nti Parvan of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, and the Yogav&acirc;sish<I>th</I>a exhibit a precisely similar framework of contents, and that the Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>atantra and the Kath&acirc;sarits&acirc;gara, among other works, follow the same model. And from this fact it may, be fairly argued, that while there is, doubtless, room for suspecting interpolations in such cases, there is this to be remembered, that with respect to any particular one of these cases, such suspicion can carry us but a very short way. And further, it is to be observed, valeat quantum, that the connexion of the several chapters of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; one with the other is not altogether a loose one, save at one or two points only, while they are all linked on to the main body of the narrative, only in what we have treated as the last chapter of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, without any trace of any other connecting link anywhere else. Upon the whole, therefore, we here conclude, though not without doubt, that the whole of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; is the work of one author.</P>
<P>The next question to be discussed is the important one of the age of the work. The quotations already given above from Sa<U>n</U>kar&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya's works, and one other which is referred to in the note below&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_995"></A><A HREF="#fn_990"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, suffice to show that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; must have been some few centuries old in the time of Sa<U>n</U>kar&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya. For whether we treat the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; as a part of the original Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata or not, it is not likely that such a scholar as <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara would have accepted the book as a genuine part of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, and as a work of Vy&acirc;sa, if it had not been in his day of some respectable antiquity, of antiquity sufficient to have thrown the real author into oblivion, and to have substituted</P>
<P>
</P>

<P>in his place Vy&acirc;sa, who lived at the junction of the Dv&acirc;para and Kali ages&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_996"></A><A HREF="#fn_991"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, upwards of thirty centuries before the Christian era. The calculation is avowedly a very rough one, but I think we may, as the result of it, safely fix the third century of the Christian era as the latest date at which the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; can have been composed. Let us now endeavour to find out whether we can fix the date as lying within any better defined period. It is scarcely needful to say, that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; dates from a period considerably subsequent to the age of the Upanishads. The passages relating to the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>asa<I>m</I>v&acirc;da and so forth, which occur originally in the Upanishads, are referred to in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; as 'ancient stories'--an indication that the Upanishads had already come to be esteemed as ancient compositions at the date of the latter work. It is not necessary, therefore, to go through an elaborate examination of the versions of the ancient stories alluded to above, as contained in the Upanishads and in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, more especially because it is possible for us to show that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; is later than the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;, which latter work, as we have seen, is later than the Upanishads. And to this point we shall now address ourselves. We have already observed upon the story referred to at the opening of this Introduction, which, historically interpreted, indicates the priority of the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc; to the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. This conclusion is confirmed by sundry other circumstances, which we must now discuss in some detail, as they are also of use in helping to fix the position of the work in the history of Sanskrit literature and philosophy. First, then, it seems to me, that the state of society mirrored in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; indicates a greater advance in social evolution than we have already seen is disclosed in the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;. Not to mention decorations of houses and so forth, which are alluded to in one passage of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, we are here told of royal oppressions, of losses of wealth accumulated with great difficulty, and of fierce captivities; we are told, to adapt the language of a modern English poet, of laws grinding the weak, for strong men rule the</P>

<P>law; we have references to the casting of images with liquefied iron, and to the use of elephants as vehicles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_997"></A><A HREF="#fn_992"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and we meet with protests against the amusements of music and dancing, and against the occupation of artisans&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_998"></A><A HREF="#fn_993"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. True it is, that all these indications put together, fail to constitute according to the standard of modern times, would be called a highly artificial state of society. But it seems to me to mark a very perceptible and distinct advance beyond the social condition in which mankind was divided into four castes or classes, with such a division of duties, to put it briefly, as that of preparation for a future world, government of this world, agriculture and trade, and service respectively&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_999"></A><A HREF="#fn_994"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Artisans, it will be observed, are not even referred to in the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;, nor is there any trice of royal oppressions, or unequal laws. Then as regards music, it may be noted, that there are references to it in the B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka and Kaush&icirc;taki-upanishads&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1000"></A><A HREF="#fn_995"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, without any indications of disapprobation. The protest against music, therefore, and the sister art of dancing, is probably to be explained as evoked by some abuses of the two arts which must have come into prevalence about the time of the composition of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. A similar protest is found recorded in the Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stras of Manu and &Acirc;pastamba and Gautama&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1001"></A><A HREF="#fn_996"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. We shall consider in the sequel the chronological positions of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; with reference to those Dharmas&acirc;stras. But we have already pointed out that the G&icirc;t&acirc; stands prior to them both&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1002"></A><A HREF="#fn_997"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>Look again at the views on caste which are embodied in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, and the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc; respectively. The reference to the Kshatriya as representing the quality of passion, while the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a represents the quality of goodness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1003"></A><A HREF="#fn_998"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, seems to place a considerably larger distance between the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, and the Kshatriya than is suggested by the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;, and thus marks an advance in the direction of the later doctrine on the subject. And in connexion</P>

<P>with this, perhaps, the discrepancy between the reading of the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc; at <A HREF="sbe0811.htm#page_85">p. 85</A>, and that of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; at <A HREF="sbe0831.htm#page_255">p. 255</A>, is not entirely without significance, though much weight would not be due to it, if it stood alone. The expression 'devoted royal sages,' which we find in- the one work, makes way for 'well-read Kshatriyas who are intent on their own duties' in the other. Again, although the passage at <A HREF="sbe0856.htm#page_353">p. 353</A> is undoubtedly susceptible of a different interpretation, it seems to me, that the word 'twice-born' there employed, was meant to be interpreted as meaning the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, and not the three twice-born castes; and if this interpretation is correct, we have here the very proposition upon the absence of which in the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc; we have already made some observations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1004"></A><A HREF="#fn_999"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. That twice-born in the passage in question means Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a only, is, of course, not a proved fact. But-having regard to the passages noted above and to the passage at <A HREF="sbe0848.htm#page_320">p. 320</A>, where reference is made to disparagement of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as--it is not twice-born there--and in the same clause with disparagement of gods and Vedas, it seems to me that the interpretation we have suggested must be taken to be the true one. And it is to be further noted, that this conclusion is corroborated by a comparison of the passage now under consideration with a passage occurring in the <I>S</I>&acirc;nti Parvan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1005"></A><A HREF="#fn_1000"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, in the R&acirc;<I>g</I>adharma section of it, where we read that 'the cow is the first among quadrupeds, gold among metals, a mantra among words, and the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is the first among bipeds.' The cow and gold occur in the passage in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; also, very near the clause we are now discussing. And it is allowable to argue, that reading the two together, twice-born in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; must be interpreted to be synonymous with Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a in the R&acirc;<I>g</I>adharma. And the same conclusion is, to my mind, confirmed indirectly by comparing the clause 'the twice-born among men' of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; with 'the ruler of men among men of that Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;, the teaching of which the former work professes to recapitulate.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_210"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 210</FONT></A></P>
<P>A similar inference seems to be derivable from a comparison of the specific doctrines as to the duties of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as which are enunciated in the G&icirc;t&acirc; and the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. In the latter work, the famous six duties are expressly mentioned. We have already argued in our Introduction to the G&icirc;t&acirc;, that a comparison of the teaching of that work upon this point with the teaching of &Acirc;pastamba and Manu shows the former to have been older than the latter. The six duties mentioned in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; are those also mentioned by Manu and &Acirc;pastamba. It follows, therefore, that the G&icirc;t&acirc; is prior to the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; also. Whether the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; is prior or subsequent to Manu and &Acirc;pastamba, is a question which will have to be discussed in the sequel.</P>
<P>The net result of the whole of this comparison appears to me to clearly show the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; to be a work of considerably more recent date than the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;. What interval of time lay between the two, is a most interesting, but also a most difficult, question. The differences we have noted appear to me to indicate a pretty wide interval. If I am right in regarding the G&icirc;t&acirc; as a work of what may be called, for practical purposes, the age of the older Upanishads, I am inclined to think that the interval between the G&icirc;t&acirc;, and the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; must have been one of larger extent than even three or four centuries. For as we have already pointed put, the description of the various 'Itih&acirc;sas' mentioned in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; as 'pur&acirc;tana'--ancient--points to at least three or four centuries having elapsed between the close of the Upanishad period and the composition of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. It is obvious, however, that this result is not one with which we can rest satisfied. Even if it were more precise and accurate, it would only fix the age of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; with reference to the age of another work itself of unknown and unascertained date. We must therefore endeavour to compare the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; with some other work, the date of which is better known. For this purpose, it seems to be not of any great use to refer to the Sankhya and Yoga-s&ucirc;tras, although it is not improbable that some materials might be forthcoming for a useful comparison between them and the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. Neither the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya nor the Yoga-s&ucirc;tras can</P>
<P><A NAME="page_211"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 211</FONT></A></P>
<P>be said to have their ages fixed with even any approach to accuracy. And in the case of the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-s&ucirc;tras there is the further difficulty presented by the circumstance, that there is room for very serious doubts as to whether the current S&ucirc;tras are really of the authorship of Kapila, or whoever else was the original founder of the system. With regard to the Yoga, one or two observations from a different point of view may not, however, be entirely out of place. At <A HREF="sbe0831.htm#page_248">p. 248</A> the Yoga <I>S</I>&acirc;stra is referred to eo nomine. What <I>S</I>&acirc;stra is here alluded to? Is it Pata&ntilde;<I>g</I>ali's, or some other <I>S</I>&acirc;stra dealing with similar topics? Or, again, is it an entirely different matter that is alluded to, and are we not to see in the expression in question an allusion to any system formally propounded? I own, as stated in the note on the passage, that my mind inclines to the last view. There is not very much to say on either side of the question, as far as I am able to understand it. But the view I incline to appears to have one small circumstance in its favour. At <A HREF="sbe0831.htm#page_249">p. 249</A> we have an allusion to persons who understand the Yoga, and to a certain illustration propounded by them. Now who are these persons? My limited knowledge of Yoga literature has not enabled me to trace the illustration anywhere else than in the Ka<I>th</I>opanishad, and in the Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;t&icirc;ya. It seems to me very unlikely, that the illustration can have been put forward in any work older than the Kathopanishad. And we may, I think, assume it as most probable that the Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;t&icirc;ya borrowed it from that work. If so, it is not likely that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; can have referred to any other master of the Yoga than, the author of the Kathopanishad. And then it would seem to follow, that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; must have been composed at a time when, although the Upanishads were looked on with reverence and as works of authority, they were not yet regarded as part and parcel of the Vedic revelation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1006"></A><A HREF="#fn_1001"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It is impossible not to perceive, that the train of reasoning here is at every stage hedged round with difficulties and doubts. And the inference therefore to which we are led by it must be accepted with proportionate</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_212"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 212</FONT></A></P>
<P>caution. But if the reasoning is correct, it seems to be certain, that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; belongs to some period prior to the second, and probable, that it belongs to some period prior to the third century, before Christ. For in the second century before Christ was composed the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;shya of Pata&ntilde;<I>g</I>ali, in which Rahasyas--which is another name for Upanishads--are mentioned as forming part of the Vedic literature. And in &Acirc;pastamba's Dharma-s&ucirc;tras, which are older than Pata&ntilde;<I>g</I>ali, Upanishads&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1007"></A><A HREF="#fn_1002"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are mentioned in the same way. I am aware that it may be said, that because Upanishads as a class of works are mentioned by Pata&ntilde;<I>g</I>ali and &Acirc;pastamba, it does not follow that any particular Upanishad, such as the Ka<I>th</I>a, for instance, also existed at that time. This is quite true. But without going now into the general question, it is sufficient to point out, that on. argument here is concerned merely with the recognition of the Upanishads as a class of works forming part of the Vedic canon. Such recognition must have come later than the period at which the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; could speak of a passage in the Ka<I>th</I>a-upanishad as the utterance of Yogavids, or persons who understood the Yoga.</P>
<P>Turning now to the materials available for ascertaining the relative chronological positions of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; and the rise of Buddhism, we have again to complain of their unsatisfactory character. We will briefly note the two or three circumstances which appear to have a bearing upon this question. In the first place, we have the word Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a used in one passage of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; in the sense of the highest tranquillity, and there the simile of the extinction of the fire Is expressly adduced. On this it may be argued, that if the term Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a had become the well-understood property of Buddhism, such a use of it as we find here would probably not have occurred. Again, we have the injunction that an ascetic must dwell in a town only for one day and no more, while he may, stay at one place during the rains. This is very similar to an injunction prescribed by the Buddhistic teachers also. But</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_213"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 213</FONT></A></P>
<P>this fact furnishes, I think, no safe ground for a chronological inference, more especially because, as pointed out by Dr. B&uuml;hler, the Buddhistic injunction is itself only borrowed from the Brahmanical rules on the subject&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1008"></A><A HREF="#fn_1003"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It is impossible, therefore, to say that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; borrowed its doctrine from Buddhism. It is, of course, equally impossible on the other hand to say, that Buddhism borrowed its rule from the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. And, therefore, we can build no safe inference upon this fact either. We have next the very remarkable passage at chapter XXXIV, where various contradictory and mutually exclusive views of piety are stated, or rather passingly and briefly indicated--a passage which one most devoutly wishes had been clearer than it is. In that passage I can find no reference to Buddhism. True it is that N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a's commentary refers some of the doctrines there stated to Buddhistic schools&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1009"></A><A HREF="#fn_1004"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. But that commentary, unsatisfactory enough in other places, is particularly unsatisfactory here. And its critical accuracy may be judged from its reference to Saugatas and Yog&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ras apparently as two distinct schools, whereas in truth the Saugatas are Buddhists, and Yog&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ras one of the four principal Buddhist sects. And it must be further remembered, that the interpretations of N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, upon which his specifications of the different schools are based, are by no means such as necessarily claim acceptance. If then we d o not find any reference to Buddhism in this passage, that fact becomes certainly a remarkable one. Still, on the other hand, I am not prepared to apply the 'negative argument' here, and to say that inasmuch as Buddhism is not referred to where so many different opinions are referred to, Buddhism cannot have come into existence at the date of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. It seems to me that the argument will here be a very hazardous one, because if the author of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; was, as we may assume he was, an orthodox Hindu, he might well have declined, although not unacquainted with Buddhism, to put into the mouths of the-seven sages even as a possible view, that</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_214"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 214</FONT></A></P>
<P>which was the view of a school esteemed heretical by the author and his co-religionists. This passage, therefore, also fails to furnish any tangible ground for a chronological inference, at all events in the present state of our knowledge. Lastly, we come to the allusion to those who indulge in constant talk in disparagement of Vedas and Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, the two being thus bracketed together in the original. That seems, at the first blush, to be a somewhat more distinct allusion to Buddhism than any of those we have noted above. But even that is not unambiguous. If the stanzas quoted by M&acirc;dhav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya, in his Sarvadar<I>s</I>anasa<U>n</U>graha in its first section, are the composition of the original founder of the <I>K</I>&acirc;rv&acirc;ka school, or even if they correctly represent the earliest opinions of that school, it is at least quite as likely that the <I>K</I>&acirc;rv&acirc;kas were the target for the denunciations of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; in the passage in question as that the Buddhists were so. To me, indeed, it appears to be more likely. For Buddha's opinion with regard to the Vedas is, that they are inadequate; with regard to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, that they are in no sense the chosen of God as they claim to be. The opinion of the <I>K</I>&acirc;rv&acirc;kas, on the other hand, is a far, more aggressive one, so to say. According to M&acirc;dhav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya, they taught that the Vedas were either simple fatuity or imposture, and that the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as were impostors. It seems to me much more likely, that this, which I have called a comparatively aggressive attitude, was the one at which the remarks of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; were levelled; and more especially does this appear to be correct when we remember, that the view taught by Gautama Buddha regarding the Vedas and the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as was propounded by him only in its strongest form; and that even before his time, the doctrine of the inadequacy of the Vedas for the purpose of securing the summum bonum of humanity had been taught by other teachers. It is further to be recollected, that we have evidence showing that other thinkers also than Buddha, or B<I>ri</I>haspati, had in early days attacked the authority of the Vedas. Kautsa is the name of one who was probably the most distinguished among them. It is certainly possible that his followers</P>
<P><A NAME="page_215"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 215</FONT></A></P>
<P>were the people branded as of 'the dark quality' by the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; in the passage in question. We have, therefore, at least two different recognised bodies of thinkers, and one individual thinker, to whom the words under discussion may apply, and it is plainly unsafe, under these circumstances, to draw any chronological inference based on the hypothesis of one particular body out of those three being the one intended by the author. Before closing this part of the investigation, it may be interesting to note, that the phrase 'turning the wheel,' a phrase now so familiar to us as one of the household words of Buddhism, is used in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; with respect to King <I>G</I>anaka. I do not think, however, that either alone, or even coupled with the word Nirv&acirc;na, that phrase can be made the basis of any legitimate deduction in favour of the priority of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, to Buddhism. At the outside, the only deduction admissible, if any deduction were admissible, would be, that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; was composed prior to the recognition, of Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a and <I>K</I>akrapravartana as specially Buddhistic words. But priority to such recognition is not, I apprehend, necessarily synonymous with priority to the rise of Buddhism.</P>
<P>The net result of this part of the investigation appears to be, that we have pretty strong grounds for holding the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; to belong to a period very considerably removed from the period of the Upanishads and the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;; but that we have no tangible grounds on which to base any deduction regarding its priority or otherwise to the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya, and Yoga systems of philosophy, or to the great movement of Gautama Buddha. There is only one other point, which we can establish in a not entirely unsatisfactory way, and which enables us to draw closer the limits within which the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; must have been composed. That point is the position of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; with reference to &Acirc;pastamba's Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. I need not say again, that I accept here the proposition about the age of &Acirc;pastamba which has been laid down by Dr. B&uuml;hler, as a sufficiently satisfactory working hypothesis. And accepting that proposition, I venture to suggest the fourth century B.C. as a not unlikely date for the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. It appears to me, that a comparison of</P>
<P><A NAME="page_216"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 216</FONT></A></P>
<P>the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; and the rules of &Acirc;pastamba upon one important point which they both deal with shows the priority of the former work. I allude to the rules and regulations touching the four &Acirc;<I>s</I>ramas or orders contained in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; and in the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra of &Acirc;pastamba. One circumstance strikes us at once on I comparing the two works on this point. &Acirc;pastamba goes into a very great deal of minute details more than the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, although the latter work does not deal with the topic in any very summary mode. Taking all the differences between the two works together, and the fact that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; sets about the discussion of the topic in a manner which seems intended to be--not, indeed, absolutely exhaustive, but still--very full, I am very strongly inclined to attribute the differences. to an actual development and progress of doctrine. I will endeavour to illustrate this view by means of a few detailed instances&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1010"></A><A HREF="#fn_1005"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And let us first take the order of householders to which the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; gives precedence over the others. One of the injunctions laid down by the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; is that the householder should always be devoted to his wife. Against this simple precept, we have a very minute series of rules prescribed by &Acirc;pastamba, which it is not necessary to refer to specifically, but which may be seen in several of the S&ucirc;tras contained in the first Kha<I>nd</I>a of the first Pa<I>t</I>ala of the Second Pra<I>s</I>na. Compare again the excessive minuteness of the rules regarding the Bali-offering or the reception of guests, as given by &Acirc;pastamba, with the simple statement of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; that the five great sacrifices should be performed. There again, I think, we are to see in this difference of treatment the result of a pretty long course of ceremonial progress. Proceeding to the rules regarding the Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin or student, an analogous phenomenon meets us there. Taking first the subject of food, we have a considerable number of detailed injunctions in &Acirc;pastamba, compared with the simple rule of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, that the student should, with the leave of his preceptor, eat his food without decrying it. Again with regard to alms, whereas the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; simply</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_217"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 217</FONT></A></P>
<P>says that the student should take his food out of the alms received by him, &Acirc;pastamba has an elaborate catena of rules as to how the alms are to be collected, and from whom, and so forth. Take again the provisions in the two works regarding the description of the cloth, staff, and girdle of the student. &Acirc;pastamba refers to various opinions on this subject, of which there is not even a trace in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1011"></A><A HREF="#fn_1006"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It appears that even before &Acirc;pastamba's time, distinctions had been laid down as to the description of girdle staff and cloth to be used by the different castes--distinctions of which there is no hint in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, where all students, of whatever caste, are spoken of under the generic name. These distinctions appear to me to point very strongly to that ceremonial and doctrinal progress of which we have spoken above. The tendency is visible in them to sever the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as from the other castes--by external marks. And that tendency, it seems to me, must have set in, as the merits which had given the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a caste its original position at the head of Hindu society were ceasing to be a living reality, and that caste was intrenching itself, so to say, more behind the worth and work of the early founders of its greatness, than the worth and work of their degenerating representatives. These comparisons, taken together, appear to me to warrant the proposition we have already laid down with regard to the priority of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; to &Acirc;pastamba. If we have not referred to the rules relating to the two other orders of forester and ascetic, it is because the scope for a comparison of those is very limited. Those rules alone would scarcely authorise the inference drawn above; but I can perceive nothing in them to countervail the effect of the comparisons already made. And it must be remembered, that the rules as to foresters and ascetics would be less apt to undergo change than chose as to students and householders.</P>
<P>It appears to me that the view we have now expressed may be also supported by a comparison of the doctrines of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; and &Acirc;pastamba touching the duties of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as. According to &Acirc;pastamba, the occupations lawful</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_218"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 218</FONT></A></P>
<P>to Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as are the famous six referred to in our Introduction to the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;, and two others superadded, namely, inheritance and gleaning corn in the fields. These last are not mentioned in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, or in Manu either, and are, even according to &Acirc;pastamba, common to Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as with Kshatriyas and Vai<I>s</I>yas. But as regards the six above referred to, it is worthy of note, that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; apparently groups them into two distinct sets of three. The first set of three consists of those which, in our Introduction to the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;, we have characterised as constituting rather the rights than the duties of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, and which the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; describes as 'means of livelihood for Br&acirc;hmanas.' The other set of three consists of real duties, and these the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; speaks of as 'pious duties.' This grouping appears to me to furnish powerful corroboration of the view put forward in our introduction to the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;. It would seem, that the possession of the moral and spiritual merits which, according to the G&icirc;t&acirc;, constituted the duty of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, in the simple and archaic society there disclosed, was developed, in a more advanced and artificial state of society, into the performance of the 'pious duties' of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; and the duties which are 'the means of livelihood.' Then in the further social evolution, in the course of which the old spiritual view began to be forgotten, and the actual facts of the past began to be transmuted into the dogmatic rules of the future, the occupations of receiving presents, imparting instruction, and officiating at sacrifices, became the special occupations of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, and the distinction between these occupations from their higher duties was thrown into the background; and accordingly we find no allusion to any such distinction in &Acirc;pastamba or Manu, or, as far as I know, in any other later embodiment of the current ideas on the subject&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1012"></A><A HREF="#fn_1007"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. If all this has been correctly argued, the conclusion derivable from it is in entire accord with that which we have already drawn, namely, that the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;, the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, and the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra of &Acirc;pastamba, belong to different</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_219"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 219</FONT></A></P>
<P>stages of ancient Indian history, and that the stage to which the G&icirc;t&acirc; belongs is the earliest, and that to which &Acirc;pastamba belongs, the latest of such stages.</P>
<P>I am unable to find anything else in the way of internal evidence bearing upon the date of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. It appears to me, that the date to which the investigation we have now gone through leads us, is one which, in the present state of our information, may be fairly accepted as a provisional hypothesis. It does not appear to me to conflict with any ascertained dates, while it is pointed to as probable by the various lines of testimony which we have here considered. We now proceed to discuss one or two other points which may have a bearing upon this topic, but which at present cannot yield us any positive guidance in our search for the date of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. And first among these, let us consider the various names of deities that occur in different parts of the work. We have, then, Vish<I>n</I>u, <I>S</I>ambhu, Gish<I>n</I>u, Soma, &Acirc;ditya, Surya, Mitra, Agni, <I>K</I>andra, Rudra, <I>S</I>iva, Varu<I>n</I>a, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, Maghavat, Purandara, Indra, Brahman, <I>S</I>atakratu, Dharma, N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, V&acirc;yu, Yama, Tvash<I>tr</I>i, Hari, &Icirc;<I>s</I>vara, and lastly Um&acirc; under three different names, namely, Um&acirc;, M&acirc;he<I>s</I>var&icirc;, and P&acirc;rvat&icirc;. Now, leaving aside for the moment the three names of Um&acirc;, which appear from the passage where they are used to be all three the names of the same goddess, there is no doubt that in the list above set out, some of the names are merely used in different passages, but still to indicate the same being. Thus, Indra, Satakratu, Purandara, and Maghavat are really the names of one and the same deity. But when Soma is mentioned as the deity presiding over the tongue, and <I>K</I>andramas as the deity presiding over the mind, it becomes doubtful whether the two names do really indicate the same deity, albeit in later Sanskrit Soma and <I>K</I>andramas both signify the moon. Similarly, when Arka is said to be the deity presiding over the eye, and Mitra over another organ, it seems open to question whether Arka and Mitra both signify the sun there, as they undoubtedly do in classical Sanskrit. True it is, that even in such a recent work as the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-s&acirc;ra, this mention</P>
<P><A NAME="page_220"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 220</FONT></A></P>
<P>of Arka and Mitra as presiding deities of two several organs does occur. But it is plain, that that circumstance can have, no bearing on the inquiry before its, for the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-s&acirc;ra is avowedly a compilation based on older authorities, and in the particular part under consideration, really reproduces a passage from some older work. It cannot, therefore, be argued, that because Arka and Mitra were identified with one another at the time of the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-s&acirc;ra, and yet are mentioned as deities of two separate organs, therefore, they must have also been regarded as one in the older original work where they are also mentioned as deities of two separate organs. And it may, perhaps, be remarked here in passing, that the Ved&acirc;nta Paribh&acirc;sh&acirc; has M<I>ri</I>tyu instead of Mitra, which would get rid of the difficulty here altogether; while as regards Soma and <I>K</I>andramas, the passage in the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya-s&acirc;ra reads Pra<I>k</I>etas instead of Soma, which would get rid of the other difficulty above pointed out. Whether these discrepancies are owing to any tampering with the lists of organs and deities, at a time when the later identifications between different deities took place, or whether they are to be explained on some other theory, it is impossible at present to say. And, therefore, it is also unnecessary to pursue the inquiry here any further. It must suffice for the present to have drawn attention to the matter.</P>
<P>Akin to this point, though quite distinct from it, is one which arises on a passage where the emancipated being is identified with Vish<I>n</I>u, Mitra, Agni, Varuna, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1013"></A><A HREF="#fn_1008"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Now it is reasonable to suppose, that the deities thus specified here must have been among those held in highest repute at the time, the whole significance of the passage where they are mentioned requiring that that should be so. But in our Pantheon as disclosed by our later literature, Mitra and Agni and Varuna occupy but a very subordinate position. Even in K&acirc;lid&acirc;sa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1014"></A><A HREF="#fn_1009"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the subordination of these deities to our celebrated Trinity seems to be quite</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_221"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 221</FONT></A></P>
<P>fully established. But, on the other hand, in the Vedic theogony they are among the most prominent deities. In the Taittir&icirc;ya-upanishad, we have in the very first sentence Mitra, Varu<I>n</I>a, Vish<I>n</I>u, and Brahman (who may be identified with Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati) all mentioned together, and their blessings invoked. This does not help in fixing a date for the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;; but it lends some support to the conclusion already arrived at on that point, by showing that the theogony of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; is not yet very far removed from the theogony of the Vedic times, while it is separated by a considerable interval from the theogony disclosed in the works of even such an early writer of the classical period' as K&acirc;lid&acirc;sa.</P>
<P>Another point of similar bearing on our present investigation is the mode in which the story of Para<I>s</I>ur&acirc;ma is dealt with in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. There is in the first place no allusion to his being an incarnation of Vish<I>n</I>u, nor to the encounter between him and his namesake, the son of Da<I>s</I>aratha and the hero of the R&acirc;m&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a. We have, on the contrary, an explicit statement, that after the advice of the 'Pit<I>ri</I>s' he entirely abandons the slaughter of the Kshatriyas, and resorting to penance thereby achieves final emancipation. We have elsewhere argued&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1015"></A><A HREF="#fn_1010"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, that the theory of Para<I>s</I>ur&acirc;ma being an incarnation of Vish<I>n</I>u, must have probably originated prior to the time of Bhart<I>ri</I>hari, but later than the time of K&acirc;lid&acirc;sa. The allusion to Parasur&acirc;ma in the work before us does not, however, enable us to judge of its chronological position with reference to K&acirc;lid&acirc;sa. But the last point discussed renders it unnecessary to consider this question further. It may be noted, by the way, that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; represents Para<I>s</I>ur&acirc;ma, although living in the &Acirc;<I>s</I>rama or hermitage of his father, who was a <I>Ri</I>shi, as mounting a chariot for the purpose of sweeping away the kinsmen of K&acirc;rtav&icirc;rya. Whence he obtained a chariot in a hermitage, the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; does not explain.</P>
<P>In connexion with the episode of Parasur&acirc;ma, may be noted the list which occurs in the course of it, of the</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_222"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 222</FONT></A></P>
<P>degraded Kshatriya tribes, of Dravi<I>d</I>as, Sabaras, &amp;c. I am unable to see that those names can give us any further help in our present investigation than in so far as they show that, at the time of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, there must have been some information about the south of India available in the districts where the author of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; lived. Some of the tribes mentioned appear to have been located far in the south of the Indian peninsula. But this is a point on which we shall have to say something more in discussing, the next item of internal evidence to which we shall refer. Here it is enough to point out that some of the tribes mentioned in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; are also referred to in no less a work than the Aitareya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1016"></A><A HREF="#fn_1011"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>We come next to the enumeration of the principal mountains which is contained in one passage of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. Those mountains are the Him&acirc;laya, the P&acirc;riy&acirc;tra, the Sahya, the Vindhya, the. Trik&ucirc;<I>t</I>avat, the <I>S</I>veta, the N&icirc;la, the Bh&acirc;sa, the Kosh<I>th</I>avat, the Mahendra, the M&acirc;lyavat, and perhaps the Guruskandha. I am not sure whether the last name is intended to be taken as a proper name, or only as an epithet of Mahendra. Now compared with the mountains mentioned in the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;, this is certainly a remarkable list. The G&icirc;t&acirc; mentions only Meru&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1017"></A><A HREF="#fn_1012"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and Him&acirc;laya; while here we have in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; the Sahya,. and Malaya, and Trik&ucirc;<I>t</I>avat, and N&icirc;la (the same, I presume, with the modem N&icirc;lgiri, the Sanatarium of the Madras Presidency), which take us far to the west and south of the Indian peninsula; and the Mahendra and M&acirc;lyavat, which, coupled with the mention of the river Ganges, cover a considerable part of the eastern districts. The Pariy&acirc;tra and Vindhya occupy the regions of Central India. The Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, therefore, seems to belong to that period in the history of India, when pretty nearly the whole,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_223"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 223</FONT></A></P>
<P>if not absolutely the whole, of the Indian continent was known to the Sanskrit-speaking population of the country. When was this knowledge reached? It is difficult to fix the precise period; and even if it could be fixed, it would not help us to fix satisfactorily any point of time to which the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; could be attributed. But it may be pointed out here, that in Pata&ntilde;<I>g</I>ali's Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;shya we have evidence of such knowledge having been possessed by the &Acirc;ryas in the second century B.C. In truth, the evidence available in the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;shya is even fuller than this in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. For Pata&ntilde;<I>g</I>ali tells us of a town or city in the south named K&acirc;&ntilde;<I>ki</I>pura&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1018"></A><A HREF="#fn_1013"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; he speaks of the dominions of the P&acirc;<I>nd</I>ya kings, and of the Kola and Kerala districts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1019"></A><A HREF="#fn_1014"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; he refers also to the large tanks of the south; and he makes allusions to linguistic usages current in the southern and other provinces&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1020"></A><A HREF="#fn_1015"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Before Pata&ntilde;<I>g</I>ali's time there had taken place Mahendra's invasion of Ceylon, and the invading army must have penetrated through the southern provinces. And there had been also put up the great Inscriptions of Asoka, which have attracted so much interest, and are proving such prolific sources of information in various departments of knowledge. One of these inscriptions was at Ga&ntilde;<I>g</I>am, which is not very far from the Mahendra mountain alluded to in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1021"></A><A HREF="#fn_1016"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. All these facts support the conclusion drawn by General Cunningham from the correctness of the information given to Alexander the Great by the Hindus of his time, namely, that 'the Indians, even at that early date in their history, had a very accurate knowledge of the form and extent of their native land&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1022"></A><A HREF="#fn_1017"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.' And not only do they support that conclusion, they show that the knowledge covered other facts regarding</P>

</P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_224"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 224</FONT></A></P>
<P>their native land than its form and extent. It follows consequently that this enumeration of mountains does not require the date of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; to be brought down to a later period than the fourth century B.C., and leaves it open to us, therefore, to accept whatever conclusion the other evidence available may seem to justify. On the other hand, it is plain also, that it affords no positive information as to when the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; was composed, and therefore we need not dwell any further upon the point on the present occasion.</P>
<P>There are a few other points which arise upon the contents of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, but which are not, in the present condition of our knowledge, capable of affording any certain guidance in our present investigation. Thus we have the story of Dharma appearing before king <I>G</I>anaka disguised as a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. I am not aware of any case of such disguises occurring in any of the Upanishads, although there are numerous parallel instances throughout the Pur&acirc;nik literature&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1023"></A><A HREF="#fn_1018"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It is, however, difficult to draw any definite chronological inference from this fact. There is further the reference to the attack of R&acirc;hu on the sun. It is difficult, in the present state of our knowledge, to say for certain, when the theory of eclipses there implied was prevalent. In the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya-upanishad&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1024"></A><A HREF="#fn_1019"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> we have the emancipated self compared to the moon escaped from the mouth of R&acirc;hu. And a text of the Rig-veda, quoted by Mr. Ya<I>g</I>&ntilde;esvara <I>S</I>&acirc;strin in his &Acirc;ryavidy&acirc;sudh&acirc;kara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1025"></A><A HREF="#fn_1020"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, speaks of the demon R&acirc;hu attacking the sun with darkness. Here again we have another matter of some interest; but I cannot see that any safe deduction can be derived from it, without a more ample knowledge of other relevant matters than is at present accessible. Take again the references to certain practices which look very much like the practices of the <I>G</I>ainas of the present day. Is the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, then, earlier or later than the rise of the <I>G</I>aina system? It is not safe, I think, to found an answer to this question upon the very narrow basis afforded by the</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_225"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 225</FONT></A></P>
<P>passage referred to. But it may be observed, that the precepts laid down in the passage in question are laid down as precepts for orthodox Hindus, and not as the doctrines of a heretical sect. They are also very general, and not so minute as those which the <I>G</I>ainas of the present day observe as binding upon them. If, therefore, any conclusion is to be drawn from these precepts, it must be that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; must have been composed prior to the rise of <I>G</I>ainism; and that <I>G</I>ainism must have appropriated and developed this doctrine which it obtained from the current Br&acirc;hmanism&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1026"></A><A HREF="#fn_1021"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. If this is so, the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; must be a very ancient work indeed. It is not, however, necessary to further work out this line of argument, having regard to the opinions recently expressed by Mr. Thomas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1027"></A><A HREF="#fn_1022"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, rehabilitating the views enunciated long ago by Colebrooke and others. If those views are correct, and if <I>G</I>ainism was a dominant system in this country prior even to the time of Gautama Buddha, and if, further, we are right in the suggestion--for it is no more it must be remembered--that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; dates from a period prior to the rise of <I>G</I>ainism, then it would seem to follow that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; belongs to some period prior to the sixth century B.C. All this, however, is at present very hypothetical, and we draw attention to it only that the question may be hereafter considered when fuller materials for adjudicating upon it become accessible. Meanwhile, having regard to the views above alluded to as so elaborately put forward by Mr. Thomas, it is possible for us still to hold that, in the present state of our knowledge, the third or fourth century B.C. is not too early a date to, assign to the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;, even on the assumption that the precepts contained in that work regarding the care to be taken of worms and insects were borrowed by it from the <I>G</I>aina system. With this negative result, we must for the present rest contented.</P>
<P>One other fact of similar nature to those we have now</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_226"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 226</FONT></A></P>
<P>dealt with may, perhaps, be also noticed here. We allude to the stanzas which we find in the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; and also in the S&acirc;nti Parvan of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata and in the Manusm<I>ri</I>ti. There is also one which the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; has in common with the Pari<I>s</I>ish<I>t</I>a of Y&acirc;ska's Nirukta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1028"></A><A HREF="#fn_1023"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It is not possible, I conceive, to say finally whether one of these works borrowed these stanzas from the other of them; while, on the other hand, it is quite possible, as already argued by us in the Introduction to the G&icirc;t&acirc;, that all these works were only reproducing from some entirely different work, or that the stanzas in question were the common property of the thinkers of the time. We have no means available for deciding between these conflicting hypotheses.</P>
<P>We have thus noticed all the salient points in the evidence, external and internal, which is available for determining the position of the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; in our ancient literature. Nobody who has seen even a little of the history of that literature will be surprised at the quantity or quality of that evidence, or the nature of the conclusions legitimately yielded by it. We have endeavoured to express those conclusions in language which should not indicate any greater certainty as attaching to them than can fairly be claimed for them. The net result appears to be this. The Anug&icirc;t&acirc; may be taken with historical certainty to have been some centuries old in the time of the great Sankar&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya. It was very probably older than the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras of &Acirc;pastamba, but by what period of time we are not in a position at present to define. It was, perhaps, older also than the rise of Buddhism and Gainism, and of the Yoga philosophy; but on this it is impossible to say anything with any approach to confidence. It is, on the other hand, almost certain that it belongs to a period very considerably removed from the older Upanishads.; probably removed by a distance of some centuries, during which 'stories' not contained in the Upanishads had not only obtained currency, but also come to be regarded as belonging to antiquity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1029"></A><A HREF="#fn_1024"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. And yet the period to</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_227"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 227</FONT></A></P>
<P>which the work belongs was one in which the Upanishads were only reverenced as the authoritative opinions of eminent men, not as the words of God himself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1030"></A><A HREF="#fn_1025"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. In this respect, it may be said that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; seems rather to belong to an earlier stratum of thought than even the Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;t&icirc;ya, in which a <I>G</I>&ntilde;&acirc;nak&acirc;<I>nd</I>a, as forming a part of the Vedic canon, seems to be recognised&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1031"></A><A HREF="#fn_1026"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. But it is abundantly clear, that the Anug&icirc;t&acirc; stands, at a very considerable chronological distance from the Bhagavadg&icirc;t&acirc;.</P>
<P>Such are the results of our investigation. We have not thought it necessary to discuss the verse or the language of the work. But it must in fairness be pointed out, that upon the whole, the verse and language are both pretty near the classical model. There are, it is true, a few instances of the metrical anomalies we have noticed elsewhere, but having regard to the extent of the work, those instances are far from being very numerous. The language and style, too, are not quite smooth and polished; though, judging from them alone, I should rather be inclined to place the Sanatsu<I>g</I>&acirc;t&icirc;ya prior to the Anug&icirc;t&acirc;. But that suggests a question which we cannot now stop to discuss.</P>
<P>One word, in conclusion, about the translation. The text used has been chiefly that adopted in the commentary of Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra, a commentary which on the whole I prefer very much to that of N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, which has been printed in the Bombay edition of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata. Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra, as a rule, affords some explanation where explanation is wanted, and does not endeavour to suit his text to any foregone conclusion. His comments have been of the greatest possible help to me; and my only regret is that the only copy of his commentary which was available to me, and the use of which I owe to the kindness of my friend Professor Bh&acirc;<I>nd</I>&acirc;rkar, was not as correct a one as could be desired. I have also looked into the Vishama<I>s</I>lok&icirc;, a short work containing notes on difficult passages of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata.</P>

<P>P. S. I take this opportunity of stating that it is not at all certain that Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra is the name of the author of the commentary which I have used. I find that in supposing Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra to be the author, I confounded that commentary, which does not mention its author's name, with the commentary on another section of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata which does give its author's name as Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra, and which is also among the MSS. purchased by Professor Bh&acirc;<I>nd</I>&acirc;rkar for the Government of Bombay.
