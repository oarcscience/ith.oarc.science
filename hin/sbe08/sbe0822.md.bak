# SANATSU*G*ÂTÎYA.

## CHAPTER I.

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said:

If, O Vidura! there is anything not (yet) said by you in (your)
discourse, then do impart it to me who wish to hear, for you have spoken
marvellous (things).

Vidura said:

O Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra! the ancient youth Sanatsu*g*âta, (otherwise called)
Sanâtana <span id="fr_608"></span>[1](#fn_605.md), who declared that death
exists not--he, O descendant of Bharata! the best of all talented men,
will explain all the doubts of your mind, both those (which are)
secret <span id="fr_609"></span>[2](#fn_606.md), and those openly declared.

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said:

What, do you not yourself know more about this (subject), that Sanâtana
should explain (it) to me? Explain (it) yourself, O Vidura! if there is
any remnant of intelligence (left) in you.

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

Vidura said:

1 am born of a *S*ûdra womb, and do not like to say more than what (I
have said). But the intelligence of that youth, I believe to be
eternal <span id="fr_610"></span>[1](#fn_607.md). He who has come of a
Brâhma*n*a womb, even though he may proclaim a great mystery, does not
thereby become liable to the censure of the gods. Therefore do I say
this to you.

Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra said:

Do you, O Vidura! speak to the ancient Sanâtana for me, so that there
may be a meeting even here, between (myself in) this body (and him).

Vai*s*ampâyana <span id="fr_611"></span>[2](#fn_608.md) said:

(Then) Vidura meditated on that sage whose vows are laudable <span
id="fr_612"></span>[3](#fn_609.md). And he, too, O descendant of Bharata!
knowing of such meditation, made his appearance. And he <span
id="fr_613"></span>[4](#fn_610.md), too, received him with the ceremonies
prescribed in the ordinances. After he had been comfortably seated, and
had taken rest, Vidura then spoke to him: 'Venerable sir! there is some
doubt in Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra's mind, which cannot

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

be explained by me. Do you be pleased to explain (it) to him. Hearing it
(explained), this lord of men may cross beyond all misery, so that gain
and loss <span id="fr_614"></span>[1](sbe0823.htm#fn_611), (what is.md)
agreeable and (what is) odious, old age and death, fear and
vindictiveness, hunger and thirst, frenzy and worldly greatness, disgust
and also laziness, desire and wrath, ruin and prosperity, may not
trouble him.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_605"></span>[149:1](sbe0822.htm#fr_608.md) So Nîlaka*nth*a.
*S*a<u>n</u>kara says Sanatsu*g*âta is Sanatkumâra, and the component
parts of the name he paraphrases by 'born from Brahman.' For Sanâtana,
see B*ri*hadâra*ny*aka, p. 506, and note  [1](sbe0821.htm#fn_593.md), [p.
141](sbe0821.htm#page_141.md) supra.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[149:2](sbe0822.htm#fr_609.md) I. e. relating to
subjects which may be freely discussed by all, and those which may not.
Nîlaka*nth*a adopts a different reading, which he interprets to mean
'doctrines exoteric and esoteric,' e. g. self-restraint, &c., and the
acquisition of mystic power, &c., respectively. The expression 'doubts
of the mind' occurs. however, further on.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[150:1](sbe0822.htm#fr_610.md) I. e., I suppose,
never-failing, and such as can deal with all sorts of topics.
Sanatkumâra, it need scarcely be stated, is the teacher of Nârada in the
famous dialogue in the *Kh*ândogyopanishad, p. 473.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[150:2](sbe0822.htm#fr_611.md) Vai*s*ampâyana is
the narrator of the grand story of which pieces like the present form
parts.

<span id="fn_609"></span>[150:3](sbe0822.htm#fr_612.md) The reading is
sometimes different, so as to mean 'of rigid vows,' as at Gîtâ, [p.
61](sbe0806.htm#page_61.md) supra.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[150:4](sbe0822.htm#fr_613.md) The pronouns here
are too numerous. Does 'he' here refer to Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra? Vidura
seems more likely, though the express mention of him in the next
sentence might be treated as pointing the other way.
