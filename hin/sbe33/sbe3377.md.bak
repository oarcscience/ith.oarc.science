### XIX. BOUNDARY DISPUTES.

1. <span id="fr_1140"></span>[1](#fn_1139.md) This rule regarding
rescission of purchase and sale has been declared. Hear the laws
concerning boundaries of villages, fields, houses, and so forth.

2. <span id="fr_1141"></span>[2](#fn_1140.md) The determination of
boundaries should be settled at the time of foundation, and it should be
marked by visible and invisible signs, so as to dispel doubt.

3. <span id="fr_1142"></span>[3](#fn_1141.md) Wells, tanks, pools, large
trees, gardens, temples, mounds, channels, the course of a river, reeds,
shrubs, or piles of stones:

4\. By such visible signs as these a boundary line should always be
caused to be marked; also, by other (marks) deposited underground which
the earth is not likely to destroy.

5. <span id="fr_1143"></span>[5](#fn_1142.md) Dry cowdung, bones, chaff,
charcoal, stones, potsherds, sand, bricks, cows’ tails, cotton seeds,
and ashes:

6\. After having placed these substances in vessels, one should deposit
them underground at the extremities of the boundary. After that, one
should take care to point them out to youths and infants.

7. <span id="fr_1144"></span>[7](#fn_1143) These (youths and infants.md)
should again show them to their own children, after having grown old;

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

by knowledge thus passing from one generation to the other, doubts
regarding boundaries may be obviated.

8. <span id="fr_1145"></span>[8](#fn_1144.md) In disputes regarding a house
or field, the decision belongs to the neighbours, as well as to the
inhabitants of that town or village, or to members of the same society,
and to the elders (of that district).

9\. (Likewise, to) husbandmen, artizans, servants, cowherds, hunters,
gleaners, diggers of roots, fishermen, kinsmen, mischief-makers, and
robbers.

10. <span id="fr_1146"></span>[10](#fn_1145.md) After having been adjured
by imprecations befitting their station, they shall determine the
boundary, and shall indicate the marks deposited underground, as
evidence. Such is the law.

11. <span id="fr_1147"></span>[11](#fn_1146.md) In default of witnesses and
signs, even a single man, agreeable to both parties, may fix the
boundary, wearing a red garland of flowers and a red cloak, putting
earth on his head, adhering to truth, and having kept a fast.

12. <span id="fr_1148"></span>[12](#fn_1147.md) Neighbours born in that
district, though they be living abroad, are termed natives of the place;
they should be consulted in the decision of a suit.

13\. What they should declare in a doubtful case, as honest men and
impartial to both parties, shall be held decisive; thus justice will not
be violated.

14. <span id="fr_1149"></span>[14](#fn_1148.md) Those are witnesses in a
suit of this kind who know the title of acquisition, the size, the
duration of the enjoyment, the name, and the characteristics of the land
in question.

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

15. <span id="fr_1150"></span>[15](#fn_1149.md)The same rule holds good in
all suits concerning immovable property. If their statements do not
agree, they shall be made to pay the highest fine.

16. <span id="fr_1151"></span>[16](#fn_1150.md) Supposing a piece of land
to have been taken from a village belonging to one man, and given to
another man, either by a large river or by the king, what should be
decided in that case?

17\. The land abandoned by a river or granted by the king belongs to him
who receives it. Otherwise, there would be no acquisition through fate
or the king among men.

18\. Loss and gain and life among men depend on the act of fate and of
the king; therefore, in all affairs, what is effected by them must not
be rescinded.

19\. When a river has been fixed as the boundary line between two
villages, it shall never be removed, on account of loss or gain arising
(from that river to either village). He who removes it, is liable to
punishment.

20\. The encroachment (of a river) on one side produces an increase of
land elsewhere in banks of rivers; that (increase) must not be taken
from him (who gets it).

21. <span id="fr_1152"></span>[21](#fn_1151.md) When land is carried away
by the swift course

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

of a river overflowing a tilled piece of ground, the previous owner
shall recover it.

22\. When land is taken from one man by a king actuated by anger or
avarice, or using a fraudulent pretext, and bestowed on a different
person as a mark of his favour, such a gift is not considered as valid.

23. <span id="fr_1153"></span>[23](#fn_1152) When (however.md) land is
taken from a person enjoying it without a legitimate title of ownership,
and given to a worthier person, (the latter) must not be deprived of it.

24. <span id="fr_1154"></span>[24](#fn_1153.md) A house, pool, shop or the
like having been used by a man since the time of its foundation, must
not be taken from him, nor diminished or altered.

25. <span id="fr_1155"></span>[25](#fn_1154.md) A window, a watercourse, a
peg projecting from a wall (used to hang things upon), a shed (erected
in a courtyard), a square of four buildings, and a channel for the exit
of water (after a rainfall), must not be blocked up, when previously
constructed.

26. <span id="fr_1156"></span>[26](#fn_1155.md) A privy, a fireplace, a
pit, or a receptacle for leavings of food and other (rubbish), must
never be made very close to the house of another man.

27. <span id="fr_1157"></span>[27](#fn_1156.md) A passage by which men and
animals go to and fro incremented is called Sa*m*sara*n*a, and must not
be obstructed by any one.

28. <span id="fr_1158"></span>[28](#fn_1157.md) He who purposely crowds
such a place (by carts and the like), or makes a pit, or plants trees,
or voids excrements, shall pay a Mâshaka as a fine.

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

29. <span id="fr_1159"></span>[29](#fn_1158.md) When a man has leased
ground, he shall sow and watch it, and reap the harvest in due season.
If he fails to, do so, he shall be compelled to make good the average
value of the crop to the owner.
