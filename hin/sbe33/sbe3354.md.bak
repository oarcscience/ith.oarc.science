### IV. WRITINGS AND POSSESSION.

1. <span id="fr_745"></span>[1](#fn_744) A writing (or document.md) should
be signed by witnesses, the (natural) order of ideas and syllables
should not be interrupted, local customs and general rules should be
observed in it, and it should be complete in every respect.

2. <span id="fr_746"></span>[2](#fn_745.md) A document signed by the king
with his own hand, or sealed with his own seal, is declared to be a
royal document, and is (considered as equal to) an attested document in
all affairs.

3. <span id="fr_747"></span>[3](#fn_746.md) A document suspected (to have a
blemish) is valid, unless the debtor should have clearly indicated its
blemish; and so (is the validity of) a document which is more than
twenty years old (established by mere lapse of time).

4. <span id="fr_748"></span>[4](#fn_747.md) In the beginning, gift is a
cause (of ownership);

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

in the middle, possession with a title; but continued and hereditary
possession by itself is also a good cause (of ownership).

5. <span id="fr_749"></span>[5](#fn_748.md) There are six modes of
acquiring wealth: by obtaining (property), what is declared to have been
given or earned, (acquisition through) valour, (in the shape of) a
marriage portion, and through inheritance from relations or others.

6. <span id="fr_750"></span>[6](#fn_749.md) Having listened to the answer,
(the plaintiff) at the trial shall produce a document as evidence, or he
shall prove possession continued for a long time, and corroborated by
(the statements of) the neighbours, or by (other) evidence.

7. <span id="fr_751"></span>[7](#fn_750.md) Supposing a religious student
were to perform some vow extending over a period of thirty-six years, or
a man (engaged in trade or traffic) were to reside abroad for a long
time in the pursuit of wealth:

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

8\. If, then, the student after having completed his period of
studentship (and returned from his preceptor) were to look after his
property, possession (by a stranger) continued for fifty years would be
capable of depriving him of his property.

9\. Twelve years for (the study of) each Veda is the period ordained for
those engaged in the pursuit of religious knowledge; for those engaged
in the acquisition of mechanical (or manual) skill, the period (of
apprenticeship) is declared to last till they have acquired their art.

10\. What has been possessed against their wish by their friends or
relations, and what has been possessed by persons offending against the
king, is not lost by the lapse of (a long) time.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[242:3](sbe3354.htm#fr_747.md) Sm*ri*ti*k*.;
Vîram. p. 200 ('Kâtyâyana'). The validity of a document having been
called into doubt, because it either has a blemish or has been vitiated
by the lapse of a considerable time, it becomes valid through proof by
ordeal. This is the meaning, mere lapse of time being insufficient to
produce validity. Sm*ri*ti*k*. This interpretation can hardly be
correct, as ordeals are not referred to in this text.

<span id="fn_747"></span>[242:4](sbe3354.htm#fr_748.md) M. Macn. III, 6, 5.
In the case of the first man (possessor) <span id="page_243">p.
243</span> possession proved by witnesses is superior to, or more
decisive than, possession, excepting hereditary possession. Such
hereditary possession, again, is superior in the case of the fourth in
descent to a title proved by documents. In the case of an intermediate
claimant (as e.g. the second or third in descent) a title coupled with
possession of short duration even is more decisive than a title entirely
destitute of possession. M.

plead possession.' Sm*ri*ti*k*.
