# THIRD TITLE OF LAW.

##### PARTNERSHIP.

\* 1. Where traders or others carry on business jointly, it is called
Partnership, which is a title of law.

\* 2. <span id="fr_358"></span>[2](#fn_358.md) Where several partners are
jointly carrying on business for the purpose of gain, the contribution
of funds towards the common stock of the association forms the basis (of
their undertakings). Therefore let each contribute his proper share.

\* 3. <span id="fr_359"></span>[3](#fn_359.md) The loss, expenses, and
profit of each partner are either equal to those of the other partners,
or exceed them, or remain below them, according as his share is equal to
theirs, or greater, or less.

\* 4. <span id="fr_360"></span>[4](#fn_360.md) The stores, the food, the
charges (for tolls and the like), the loss, the freight, and the expense
of keeping valuables must be duly paid for by each of the several
partners, in accordance with the terms of their agreements.

5. <span id="fr_361"></span>[5](#fn_361) (Each partner.md) is responsible
for what has been

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

lost by his want of care, or in consequence of his acting against the
instructions of, or without authorization from, all the other
coparceners.

\* 6. <span id="fr_362"></span>[6](#fn_362.md) Where the property of the
partnership is in danger through fate, through a gang of robbers, or
through the king, the tenth part of the goods shall belong to him who
has preserved them through his own exertion.

\* 7. <span id="fr_363"></span>[7](#fn_363.md) Should one partner meet with
an accident, his heir shall replace him; or on failure of an heir,
another man, or all (the partners) if they are capable (of becoming his
substitute).

\* 8. <span id="fr_364"></span>[8](#fn_364.md) In the sane way, where an
officiating priest has met with an accident, another (priest) shall
officiate for him, and receive from him his part of the fee to the
stipulated amount.

\* 9. <span id="fr_365"></span>[9](#fn_365.md) Where an officiating priest
forsakes a sacrificer,

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

who is no offender and free from guilt, or where (a sacrificer) forsakes
a faultless priest, they shall both be punished.

\* 10. There are three sorts of officiating priests: one honoured by
previous generations, one appointed by (the sacrificer) himself, and one
who performs the functions of a priest of his own accord through
friendship.

\* 11. <span id="fr_366"></span>[11](#fn_366.md) This law applies to
hereditary and self-chosen priests. But it is no sin to abandon a priest
officiating of his own accord.

\* 12. <span id="fr_367"></span>[12](#fn_367.md) A trader on reaching a
toll-house should pay the legal duty. A prudent man must not try to
evade it, (because) it is called the (king's) tax.

\* 13. <span id="fr_368"></span>[13](#fn_368.md) If he evades a toll-house,
or if he buys or sells at another than the legal hour, or if he does not
state the value (of his goods) correctly, he shall be fined eight times
the amount which he tried to evade.

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

14. <span id="fr_369"></span>[14](#fn_369.md) It is declared that a wise
man should always abstain from levying a toll on that property of a
learned Brahman which belongs to his household; but not (on that which
he uses) for trading purposes.

15. <span id="fr_370"></span>[15](#fn_370.md) The alms received by
Brahmans, the property of stage players, and what is capable of being
carried on one's back; on all that he must raise no duty.

\* 16. If a travelling merchant who has come into his country should die
there, the king shall preserve his goods till the heir comes forward.

\* 17. On failure of an heir, he must make them over to his relatives or
connexions. On failure of them, he shall keep them well guarded for a
period of ten years.

\* 18. <span id="fr_371"></span>[18](#fn_371.md) When such property without
an owner, and which is not claimed by an heir, has been preserved for
ten years, the king may keep it for himself. Thus the sacred law will
not be violated.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_358"></span>[124:2](sbe3335.htm#fr_358.md) III, 2. Thus, e.g.
a principal amounting to 1000 Drammas is invested in their common
business by four partners. One contributes one-half of the principal,
i.e. 500 Drammas. Another contributes one-fifth, i.e. 200 Drammas. A
third contributes 200 Drammas likewise. A fourth contributes 100
Drammas. The percentage of the gain and of the charges will be in
accordance with the share contributed by each partner. A.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[124:3](sbe3335.htm#fr_359.md) Manu VIII, 211;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 259.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[124:4](sbe3335.htm#fr_360.md) The expense
incurred by the purchase of merchandise, for food, &c., has to be
defrayed by all the partners in due shares, according to the terms
originally agreed on, and the several shares contributed by them. A.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[124:5](sbe3335.htm#fr_361.md) He who causes the
loss of funds contributed by all the partners must make it good, and so
must he who has infringed <span id="page_125">p. 125</span> the rules of
the society, or who has caused a loss by acting without authorization
from his partners. A. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 260.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[125:6](sbe3335.htm#fr_362.md) If any one member
of the society exerts himself to guard their common property against a
fire, or against a gang of robbers, or against an encroaching prince who
wants to seize it, he shall receive a tenth part of it, as a reward for
his trouble. A. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 260.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[125:7](sbe3335.htm#fr_363.md) Should any one
among the partners die, his sons or other heirs shall take his share.
Failing heirs, it shall belong to any other partner, who is able to
officiate for him. Or, if all are able to officiate for him, they all
shall take it together. A. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 265.

<span id="fn_364"></span>[125:8](sbe3335.htm#fr_364.md) If among several
officiating priests one should meet with a calamity, his share of the
work shall pass to another, and the stipulated fee shall also belong to
his substitute. A. Manu VIII, 206.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[125:9](sbe3335.htm#fr_365.md) If the case of an
officiating priest or sacrificer who has left the other party from
anger, avarice, or some other reprehensible motive, and without
delinquencies on the part of the other party, be brought before the
king, he shall punish him. A. Manu VIII, 389; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 237;
Vish*n*u V, 113.

<span id="fn_366"></span>[126:11](sbe3335.htm#fr_366.md) In the case of
those officiating priests who have been employed by the ancestors of the
sacrifices, i.e. who are hereditary in his family, and in the case of
those who have been chosen by himself the punishment ordained for
forsaking a priest should be inflicted. But if the sacrificer abandons
one who officiates for him from friendship, and employs in his place one
better qualified, or more acceptable to himself, awarding to him the
stipulated fee, he is free from blame. A.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[126:12](sbe3335.htm#fr_367.md) A duty is the
king's due, and traders must not defraud the king of it. A.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[126:13](sbe3335.htm#fr_368.md) There are three
ways for evading a duty: one, if a merchant avoids a toll-house and thus
escapes paying the ordinary toll; another, if he buys or sells at an
unseasonable time a commodity on which he has not paid the customary
duty; a third, if he does not state correctly the amount or value of his
goods or chattels. A merchant, who has committed any one out of these
offences, shall pay eight times the amount of the duty embezzled by him
as a fine. A. Manu VIII, 400; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 262.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[127:14](sbe3335.htm#fr_369.md) The term
*S*rotriya, 'a learned Brahman,' applies to Brahmans generally in this
place. All the chattels of a Brahman, except what belongs to the
household furniture, are liable to pay duty. Likewise, if he imports and
exports goods in trading, those goods have to pay duty. A. Manu VII,
133; Âpastamba II, 10, 26, 10; Vasish*th*a XIX, 23; Vish*n*u III, 26.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[127:15](sbe3335.htm#fr_370.md) The following
three descriptions of property shall be exempt from taxation: alms
received by Brahmans, no matter how great their value; the property of
actors, singers, and the like persons; and what may be carried on the
shoulders by any one. A. Vasish*th*a XIX, 37.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[127:18](sbe3335.htm#fr_371.md) Read adâyâda*m* in
the text.
