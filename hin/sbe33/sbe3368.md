### X. ORDEALS.

1. <span id="fr_984"></span>[1](#fn_983.md) A forger of gems, pearl, or
coral, one withholding a deposit, a ruffian, and an adulterer, shall be
tested by oaths or ordeals in every case.

2\. In charges relating to a heavy crime or to the appropriation of a
deposit, the king should try the cause by ordeals, even though there be
witnesses.

3\. When a thing has happened long ago or in secret, or when the
witnesses have disappeared long ago, or are perjured all of them, the
trial should be conducted by having recourse to an ordeal.

4. <span id="fr_985"></span>[4](#fn_984.md) The balance, fire, water,
poison, and, fifthly, sacred libation; sixthly, grains of rice;
seventhly, a hot piece of gold, are declared (to be ordeals).

5. <span id="fr_986"></span>[5](#fn_985.md) The ploughshare is mentioned as
the eighth kind, the ordeal by Dharma (and Adharma) as the ninth. All
these ordeals have been ordained by the Self-existent (Brahman).

6. <span id="fr_987"></span>[6](#fn_986.md) Truth, a vehicle, weapons,
cows, seeds, and gold, venerable gods or Brahmans, the heads of sons or
wives:

7\. By these have oaths been ordained, which are easy to perform and
proper for trifling occasions.

8. <span id="fr_988"></span>[8](#fn_987.md) When a quarrel between two
litigants has arisen regarding a debt or other charge, that ordeal

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

must be administered which corresponds to the amount (of the sum in
dispute) and to the (character or strength of the) individual (to be
examined).

9. <span id="fr_989"></span>[9](#fn_988) (The ordeal by.md) poison should
be administered when (property worth) a thousand (Pa*n*as) has been
stolen; (the ordeal by) fire, when a quarter less than that (or 750, has
been stolen).

10\. When the charge concerns four hundred, the hot piece of gold should
be administered. (When it concerns) three hundred, the grains of rice
should be given; and the sacred libation, (when it concerns) half of
that.

11. <span id="fr_990"></span>[11](#fn_989.md) When a hundred has been
stolen or falsely denied, purgation by Dharma should be administered.
Thieves of cows should be subjected by preference to the (ordeal by the)
ploughshare by the judges.

12. <span id="fr_991"></span>[12](#fn_990.md) These figures are applicable
in the case of low persons; for persons of a middling kind, double is
ordained; and for persons of the highest, rank, the amount has to be
fixed four times as high by persons entrusted with judicial affairs.

13. <span id="fr_992"></span>[13](#fn_991.md) The quantities (of various
coins or weights), beginning with a floating particle of dust and ending
with a Kârshâpa*n*a, have been declared by Manu. They are applicable
both to ordeals and to fines.

14. <span id="fr_993"></span>[14](#fn_992.md) A Nishka is four
*S*uvar*n*as. A Pa*n*a of

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

copper is a Kârshika (having the weight of one Karsha). A coin made of a
Karsha of copper has to be known as a Kârshika Pa*n*a.

15. <span id="fr_994"></span>[15](#fn_993.md) It is also called an
A*nd*ikâ. Four such are a Dhânaka. Twelve of the latter are a Suvar*n*a.
That is also called a Dînâra (denarius).

16. <span id="fr_995"></span>[16](#fn_994) (The testimony of.md) witnesses
is apt to become invalid, whether it be through affection, anger, or
avarice. An ordeal properly administered never loses its validity.

17. <span id="fr_996"></span>[17](#fn_995.md) When a doubt arises with
regard to a document or oral evidence, and when ratiocination also
fails, purgation through ordeal (is the proper test).

18. <span id="fr_997"></span>[18](#fn_996.md) Let an ordeal be administered
according to the established rule by persons acquainted with the rule of
ordeals. If it is administered against the rule, it is ineffective as a
means of proving what ought to be proved.

19. <span id="fr_998"></span>[19](#fn_997.md) If one who has been subjected
to the ordeal by balance goes down on being weighed (for the second
time), he shall be held guilty. If he remains level, he shall be
balanced once more. If he rises, he gains his cause.

20. <span id="fr_999"></span>[20](#fn_998.md) Should the scale break, or
the balance, or beam, or iron hooks split, or the strings burst, or the
transverse beam split, he would have to be declared guilty.

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

21. <span id="fr_1000"></span>[21](#fn_999) (In the ordeal by water.md) he
should immerse the individual in water and discharge three arrows.

22. <span id="fr_1001"></span>[22](#fn_1000.md) He is acquitted (in the
ordeal by poison) who has digested poison, which has been given to him
according to rule, without the application of spells or antidotes.
Otherwise he should be punished and compelled to pay the sum in dispute.

23. <span id="fr_1002"></span>[23](#fn_1001.md) To whatsoever deity the
accused happens to be devoted, let (the judge) bathe the weapon of that
deity in water, and give him to drink three handfuls of it.

24. <span id="fr_1003"></span>[24](#fn_1002.md) He to whom no calamity
happens, within a week or a fortnight, (either to himself or) to his
son, wife or property, is innocent beyond doubt.

25. <span id="fr_1004"></span>[25](#fn_1003.md) Let a man chew grains of
rice after having kept a fast and purified himself, at a time when the
sun is not visible. He is acquitted if what he spits out is pure; but if
it be mixed with blood, he must be (held) guilty.

26. <span id="fr_1005"></span>[26](#fn_1004) Let (the person.md) take a hot
piece of gold out of (a mixture of) well-heated oil and butter.

27. <span id="fr_1006"></span>[27](#fn_1005.md) He whose fingers’ ends do
not tremble, and who does not become blistered, is acquitted according
to law, as has been declared by Pitâmaha.

28. <span id="fr_1007"></span>[28](#fn_1006.md) Iron twelve Palas in weight
should be formed into what is called a ploughshare. It should be eight
Aṅgulas long by four Aṅgulas broad.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

29\. (The ploughshare) having been made red-hot in fire, a thief should
be made to lick at it once with his tongue. If he is not burnt, he
obtains acquittal. Otherwise he loses his cause.

30. <span id="fr_1008"></span>[30](#fn_1007) (Images of.md) Dharma and
Adharma, one black and the other white, should be painted on two leaves.
Then they should be invoked with prayers producing life or others, and
with the Gâyatrî or other Sâmans,

31\. And should be worshipped with perfumes and with white and black
flowers, sprinkled with the five products of a cow, and enclosed in
balls made of earth afterwards.

32\. After having been made equal in size, they should be placed
unobserved in a fresh jar. Then the person should take one ball out of
the vessel at the bidding (of the judge).

33\. If he takes out Dharma, he is acquitted, and should be honoured by
the (appointed) examiners.

p. 285. Some texts relating to this kind of <span id="page_319">p.
319</span> ordeal are found in the Nepalese Nârada as well, but they are
very incorrectly given in the MS. 'The judge, after having placed a
ploughshare of the size stated in the text into a fire kindled for that
purpose, should perform the whole general rite of ordeals, beginning
with the invocation addressed to Dharma and ending with the fixing of a
writing on the head of the person. Then, after addressing the fire with
the text previously quoted (of Pitâmaha), "Thou, O Agni," &c., and after
causing the person to address the fire with the text previously quoted,
"Thou, O Agni, (livest) in all beings" (Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 104), he
should cause the person to lick (at the ploughshare).' Vîram.,
Sm*ri*ti*k*.
