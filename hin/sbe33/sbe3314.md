#### 7. Usurers.

\* 110. <span id="fr_205"></span>[110](#fn_205.md) Thus has the rule been
declared for the interest to be paid on loans offered through
friendship. If, however, interest be demanded on grain, at the rate
which has been mentioned, it is termed usury.

\* 111. <span id="fr_206"></span>[111](#fn_206.md) A Vai*s*ya is at liberty
to get over a period of distress by practising usury. A Brahman must
never resort to usury, not even in the extremity of distress.

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

\* 112. <span id="fr_207"></span>[112](#fn_207.md) If a debt is due to a
(dead) Brahman creditor, whose issue is living, (it must be paid to
them.) If there be no issue, the king must cause the debt to be paid to
his kinsmen; on failure of kinsmen (it must be paid) to his relatives.

\* 113. <span id="fr_208"></span>[113](#fn_208.md) Where there are neither
kinsmen, nor relatives, nor distant connexions, it shall be paid to
(other) Brahmans. On failure of such, he must cast it into the waters.

\* 114. <span id="fr_209"></span>[114](#fn_209.md) When a creditor receives
payment, he must give a receipt for it to the debtor. If he does not
give a receipt, although he has been asked for it, he shall lose the
remainder of the sum due to him.

\* 115. <span id="fr_210"></span>[115](#fn_210.md) If, though pressed by
the debtor, he does not give an acquittance for the sum paid to him by
the debtor, that sum shall yield interest to the debtor (henceforth), as
(it had done) to the creditor (previously).

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

\* 116. <span id="fr_211"></span>[116](#fn_211.md) On payment of the debt,
he must restore the bond. On failure of a bond, he must give a written
receipt. Thus the creditor and debtor will be quits.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_203"></span>[68:108](sbe3313.htm#fr_203.md) The chattels,
which have been mentioned in the preceding paragraph, if lent in
amicable intercourse, shall not yield any interest before the expiration
of six months, without a special stipulation to that effect. Even
without a stipulation to that effect, however, they shall yield interest
after the lapse of six months. A.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[68:109](sbe3313.htm#fr_204.md) A loan which is
not restored, on demand even, shall yield interest at the rate of 5 per
cent. from that day forward, even though six months are not yet over. A.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[68:110](sbe3314.htm#fr_205.md) The term karman is
sometimes used as an equivalent for gold. A. This interpretation has not
been followed.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[68:111](sbe3314.htm#fr_206.md) Agriculture, the
tending of cattle, &c., are lawful occupations for a Vai*s*ya. Lending
money at interest is also permitted to him. Therefore it is said here
that a Vai*s*ya may practise usury in times of distress, whereas a
Brahman must not resort to usury even in times of overwhelming distress.
A.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[69:112](sbe3314.htm#fr_207.md) Sakulya,
'kinsman,' is derived from kulya, 'a bone,' and denotes those who have
their bones in common (sic), i.e. a father, a paternal uncle, their
sons, and other (agnates). Bandhu, 'a relative,' denotes a mother, a
sister, a sister's son, and other (agnates). A.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[69:113](sbe3314.htm#fr_208.md) This paragraph is
intended to show the pre-eminence of the Brahman caste. A.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[69:114](sbe3314.htm#fr_209.md) In Colebrooke's
Digest (I, 6, 287) the second half of this paragraph is referred to a
refusal on the part of the creditor to restore the money, which the
debtor had asked him for, on his refusing to give a receipt. This
construction is based on the comment of *G*agannâtha, but it is not
countenanced by the remarks of Asahâya, and is thoroughly artificial.
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 93; Vish*n*u VI, 26.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[69:115](sbe3314.htm#fr_210.md) If the creditor
fails to receipt the sum which has been restored to him, on the back of
the document, it shall yield interest to the debtor, in the same way as
it had yielded interest to the creditor previously. A.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[70:116](sbe3314.htm#fr_211.md) Where the bond is
no longer in existence, because it has been stolen or destroyed, or met
with some calamity, the creditor, instead of it, shall give a written
receipt to the debtor. Here ends the sixth section of the law of debt,
which treats of lending money at interest and of usurers. A.
