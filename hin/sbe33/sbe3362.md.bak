### IV. THE ANSWER.

1. <span id="fr_905"></span>[1](#fn_904.md) When the plaint has been well
defined, a clear exposition given of what is claimed and what not, and
the meaning of the plaint fully established, (the

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

judge) shall then cause the answer to be written (by the defendant).

2. <span id="fr_906"></span>[2](#fn_905.md) If the defendant does not make
an answer fully meeting the contents of the plaint, he shall be
compelled to pay by gentle remonstrances, and the other (two) methods
(to be indicated directly).

3\. Kindly speeches are gentle remonstrances; intimidation is pointing
out dangers; force consists of depriving one of his property, or
striking, or binding him.

4\. When a man makes no answer, though both (mild and harsh methods)
have been adopted against him, he is defeated, and liable to punishment
after the lapse of a week.

5. <span id="fr_907"></span>[5](#fn_906.md) When the defendant asks for a
delay through (natural) timidity, or terror, or because his memory has
been deranged, the delay shall be granted to him.

6\. He should be allowed (a delay extending to) one day, or three days,
or five days, or seven days, or a fortnight, or a month, or three
seasons (equalling six months), or a year, according to his ability.

7. <span id="fr_908"></span>[7](#fn_907.md) The insane and intoxicated,
those abandoned by their relatives or friends, those charged with a
heavy crime, idiots, persons cast off from society, and infants, should
be considered unable to deliver an answer.

8. <span id="fr_909"></span>[8](#fn_908.md) One should not cause to be
written an answer

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

which wanders from the subject, or which is not to the point, too
confined or too extensive, or not in conformity with the plaint, or not
thorough enough, or absurd, or ambiguous.

9. <span id="fr_910"></span>[9](#fn_909) If (the defendant.md) confesses,
he shall state his confession; in the case of a denial, he shall cause
(his denial) to be written; and so (should he record) his special plea
in an answer by special plea, and his previous victory in an answer by
previous victory.

10\. A denial called forth by fear (of punishment) is contemptible in
the eyes of men familiar with law; a true confession is declared to be
meritorious.

11\. In a plea by victory in a former trial, a true statement is praised
by the virtuous; a false one is sinful and causes the defeat of the
defendant.
