### XXIV. DUTIES OF MAN AND WIFE.

1. <span id="fr_1208"></span>[1](#fn_1207.md) The whole set of commandments
concerning adultery has thus been stated; listen to me proclaiming the
conduct prescribed for man and wife.

2. <span id="fr_1209"></span>[2](#fn_1208.md) A woman must be restrained
from slight transgressions even by her relations; by night and by day
she must be watched by her mother-in-law and other wives belonging to
the family.

3. <span id="fr_1210"></span>[3](#fn_1209.md) A father who does not give
his daughter in

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

marriage in proper time (before she has reached maturity), a husband who
has not connexion with his wife at the time favourable for procreation,
and a son who does not support his mother: all such deserve contempt and
shall be punished as ordained in law.

4. <span id="fr_1211"></span>[4](#fn_1210) Employing (a woman.md) in the
receipt and expenditure (of wealth), in the preparation of food, in the
preservation of domestic utensils, in purification, and in the care of
the (sacred household) fire, is declared to be the (best) way of
guarding women.

5. <span id="fr_1212"></span>[5](#fn_1211.md) Let not a woman reside in
another man's house, separated from her father, husband, or sons; by
(giving way to) malicious propensities, particularly, she is sure to
lose her reputation.

6. <span id="fr_1213"></span>[6](#fn_1212) Rising before (the others.md),
paying reverence to the elders of the family, preparing food and
condiments, and using a low seat and bed: thus have the duties of women
been declared.

7. <span id="fr_1214"></span>[7](#fn_1213) Drinking (spirituous liquor.md),
rambling abroad, sleeping by day, and neglect of her daily duties, are
faults disgracing a woman.

8. <span id="fr_1215"></span>[8](#fn_1214.md) That wife is declared to be
devoted to her husband who is afflicted when he is afflicted, pleased
when he is happy, squalid and languid when he is absent, and who dies
when he dies.

9. <span id="fr_1216"></span>[9](#fn_1215.md) While her husband is absent,
a woman must avoid decorating herself, as well as dancing, singing,

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

looking on at public spectacles or festivals, and using meat or
intoxicating drinks.

10. <span id="fr_1217"></span>[10](#fn_1216.md) A wife practising religious
austerities, fasting and preserving her chastity, self-controlled and
liberal always, goes to heaven even though she have no son.

11. <span id="fr_1218"></span>[11](#fn_1217.md) A wife is considered half
the body (of her husband), equally sharing the result of his good or
wicked deeds; whether she ascends the pile after him, or chooses to
survive him leading a virtuous life, she promotes the welfare of her
husband.

12. <span id="fr_1219"></span>[12](#fn_1218.md) The Niyoga (appointment of
a widow to raise offspring to her deceased lord) has been declared by
Manu, and again prohibited by the same; on account of the successive
deterioration of the (four) ages of the world, it must not be practised
by mortals (in the present age) according to law.

13\. In the ages K*ri*ta, Tretâ, and Dvâpara, men were imbued with
devotion and sacred knowledge; in the (present or) Kali age, a decrease
of its power has been ordained for the human race.

14\. The various sons who were appointed by ancient sages cannot be
adopted now by men of the present age, as they are destitute of power.
