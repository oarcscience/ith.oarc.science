# SIXTH TITLE OF LAW.

##### NON-PAYMENT OF WAGES.

\* 1. A series of rules will be stated (next) for the payment and
non-payment of labourers’ wages. It is termed 'Non-payment of Wages,' a
title of law.

\* 2. <span id="fr_409"></span>[2](#fn_409.md) A master shall regularly pay
wages to the servant hired by him, whether it be at the commencement, at
the middle, or at the end of his work, just as he had agreed to do.

\* 3. <span id="fr_410"></span>[3](#fn_410.md) Where the amount of the
wages has not been fixed, (the servant of) a trader, a herdsman, and an
agricultural servant shall respectively take a tenth part of the profit
(derived from the sale of merchandise), of the seed of cows, and of the
grain.

\* 4. <span id="fr_411"></span>[4](#fn_411.md) Their implements of work,
and whatever else

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

may have been entrusted to them for their business, they shall employ
with due care and not neglect them wantonly.

\* 5. <span id="fr_412"></span>[5](#fn_412.md) If one fails to perform such
work as he had promised to do, he shall be compelled to perform it,
first paying him his wages. If he does not perform it after having taken
wages, he must pay back twice the amount of his wages.

\* 6. <span id="fr_413"></span>[6](#fn_413.md) One who abandons merchandise
which he had agreed to convey to its destination, shall give a sixth
part of the wages. (An employer) who does not pay the wages which he had
agreed to give shall forfeit those wages together with interest.

\* 7. <span id="fr_414"></span>[7](#fn_414.md) A merchant who does not take
a conveyance

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

or beasts for draught or burden, after having hired them, shall be made
to pay a fourth part of the hire; and the whole, if he leaves them
half-way.

\* 8. <span id="fr_415"></span>[8](#fn_415.md) And so shall a carrier who
fails to transport (the goods entrusted to him) forfeit his wages. He
shall be compelled to pay twice the amount of his wages, if he raises
difficulties at the time of starting.

\* 9. <span id="fr_416"></span>[9](#fn_416.md) When the merchandise has
been damaged by the carrier's fault, he shall have to make good every
loss, not including such losses as may have been caused by fate or by
the king,

\* 10. <span id="fr_417"></span>[10](#fn_417) For (tending.md) a hundred
cows, (a heifer shall be given to the herdsman) as wages every year; for
(tending) two hundred (cows), a milch cow (shall be given to him
annually), and he shall be allowed to milk (all the cows) every eighth
day.

\* 11. <span id="fr_418"></span>[11](#fn_418) Those (cows.md) which a
cowherd takes to

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

pasture every day when the night is over, he shall take back again in
the evening, after they have eaten (grass) and drunk (water).

\* 12. <span id="fr_419"></span>[12](#fn_419.md) If such a cow meets with
an accident, he shall struggle to protect her as best he may. If he is
unable (to rescue her) he shall go in haste to announce it to his
master.

\* 13. <span id="fr_420"></span>[13](#fn_420.md) Should he neither struggle
to protect (the cow), nor raise a cry, nor announce it to his master,
the herdsman must make good the value of the cow (to the owner), and
(must pay) a fine to the king.

\* 14. <span id="fr_421"></span>[14](#fn_421.md) But the herdsman alone
shall make good (the loss of an animal) which has strayed, or been
destroyed by worms, or slain by dogs, or met its death (by tumbling)
into a pit, if he did not duly exert himself (to prevent such
accidents).

\* 15. <span id="fr_422"></span>[15](#fn_422.md) So if goats or sheep are
surrounded by wolves, and the herdsman does not come (to their
assistance), he shall be responsible for any (animal) which a wolf may
attack and kill.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

\* 16. <span id="fr_423"></span>[16](#fn_423) But for (an animal.md) seized
by robbers, though he raised a cry, the herdsman shall not be bound to
pay, provided he gives notice to his master at the proper place and
time.

\* 17. <span id="fr_424"></span>[17](#fn_424.md) It is according to these
principles that all disputes arising with herdsmen have to be settled.
In case of the (natural) death (of an animal entrusted to his care the
herdsman) is free from blame, if he can produce the tail, the horns, and
the rest.

\* 18. <span id="fr_425"></span>[18](#fn_425.md) If a public woman declines
to receive a man after having received her fee, she shall pay twice the
amount (of the fee). The same (fine shall be imposed) on a man who does
not pay the (stipulated) fee, after having had connexion with a woman
(of this description).

\* 19. Should a man unnaturally abuse the person (of a public woman) or
cause her to be approached by many: he must pay eight times the amount
(of the stipulated fee), and a fine to the same amount.

\* 20. If a man has built a house on the ground of a stranger and lives
in it, paying rent for it, he may take with him, when he leaves the
house, the thatch, the timber, the bricks, and other (building
materials).

\* 21. <span id="fr_426"></span>[21](#fn_426.md) But if he has been
residing on the ground

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

of a stranger, without paying rent and against that man's wish, he shall
by no means take with him, on leaving it, the thatch and the timber.

\* 22. <span id="fr_427"></span>[22](#fn_427.md) Hired commodities shall be
restored (by the hirer), when the fixed period has expired. The hirer
must make good whatever may have been spoiled or destroyed except in the
case of (inevitable) accident.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_409"></span>[139:2](sbe3338.htm#fr_409.md) VI, 2. When the
amount of the wages has been fixed by an agreement in this form, 'I will
give thee thus much,' it shall be divided into three parts, and one part
be given on three occasions, viz. at the commencement, middle, and end
of the labour. This rule is applicable where the amount of the wages has
been fixed. The next paragraph states the rule for those cases where the
amount of the wages has not been fixed. Vîramitrodaya, p. 414.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[139:3](sbe3338.htm#fr_410.md) The strange term
'the seed of cows' denotes cows’ milk according to the commentators.
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 194.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[139:4](sbe3338.htm#fr_411.md) The phrase
'whatever may have been entrusted to servants for their business' is
explained as referring to grain and the like <span id="page_140">p.
140</span> used for agriculture. It appears from the preceding paragraph
that business of every sort is intended. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 193.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[140:5](sbe3338.htm#fr_412.md) Manu VIII, 215;
Âpastamba II, 11, 28, 2-3; Vish*n*u V, 153, 154; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 193.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[140:6](sbe3338.htm#fr_413.md) The Ratnâkara
refers the second half of this paragraph, like the first half, to the
special case of wages or hire promised to the carrier for the transport
of goods. See Colebrooke's Digest, III, I, 92. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 198.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[140:7](sbe3338.htm#fr_414.md) 'A conveyance,' a
cart or the like. 'Beasts for draught or burden,' horses or others. When
a man hires the conveyance, &c. of another for the purpose of
transporting merchandise, and does not transport the merchandise
afterwards, because he has promised to pay an excessive hire, he shall
pay a fourth part of the promised hire to the owner of the conveyance.
When, however, he takes the conveyance and leaves it, after having
completed one half of the journey, he shall have to pay the whole of the
hire. Vîramitrodaya, p. 420. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 198. Of vv. 6, 7, the
Nepalese MS. has an entirely different version, as follows: ‘\* 6. One
who abandons his work before the expiration of the term, forfeits his
wages. If it is through the fault of his employer that he strikes work,
he shall be rewarded for as much as has been finished by him. 7. He who
leaves on the road that which he had undertaken to transport, shall give
a sixth part of the (stipulated) wages. An employer who does not pay
(wages) after having set the workman to work, (shall be <span
id="page_141">p. 141</span> compelled to pay) the wages together with
interest.’ This is probably the true reading, as paragraphs 6 and 7 are
quoted in this form in the Vîramitrodaya and in Colebrooke's Digest
respectively.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[141:8](sbe3338.htm#fr_415.md) According to the
Mitâksharâ (p. 280), the excessive fine ordained in the second half of
this paragraph shall be inflicted when a man raises obstacles on
specially important occasions, such as a wedding, or the auspicious time
for undertaking a journey. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 197.

<span id="fn_416"></span>[141:9](sbe3338.htm#fr_416.md) 'Merchandise,'
pearls or other commodities which are to be transported. 'Damaged,' i.e.
destroyed. In the terms 'merchandise' and 'carrier,' which are
successively used in this paragraph, a bull and a husbandman are
included by implication. Thus it is declared in the Madanaratna.
Vîramitrodaya, p. 418. What the Madanaratna means is this, that the
responsibility of a husbandman for a bull used by him for the purposes
of agriculture is analogous to the responsibility of a carrier for the
goods he has undertaken to transport. Vish*n*u V, 155, 156;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 197.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[141:10](sbe3338.htm#fr_417.md) Manu VIII, 231.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[141:11](sbe3338.htm#fr_418.md) Manu VIII, 230;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 164.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[142:12](sbe3338.htm#fr_419.md) He shall struggle
to protect the cow, and if unable to protect her he shall raise an
alarm. Ratnâkara. See Colebrooke's Digest, III, 4, 11.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[142:13](sbe3338.htm#fr_420.md) The second half of
this paragraph is read as follows in the Nepalese MS.: 'The herdsman is
to blame in that case, and he shall make good the loss.'

<span id="fn_421"></span>[142:14](sbe3338.htm#fr_421.md) Nearly identical
with Manu VIII, 232. Read nash*t*a*m* in the text. The Nepalese MS. here
inserts the following paragraph, which is nearly identical with Manu
VIII, 234: 'If cattle die, let him give everything to the owner: the
tail, skin, the hindpart, the thigh, the bladder, tendons, and yellow
concrete bile, and let him point out their particular marks.'

<span id="fn_422"></span>[142:15](sbe3338.htm#fr_422.md) Identical with
Manu VIII, 235. The Nepalese MS. adds the following paragraph, which is
nearly identical with Manu VIII, 236: 'If they graze together in the
forest, without being kept in order, and a wolf, suddenly jumping on one
of them, kills it, the herdsman shall be free from blame in that case.'

<span id="fn_423"></span>[143:16](sbe3338.htm#fr_423.md) Identical with
Manu VIII, 233.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[143:17](sbe3338.htm#fr_424.md) The term 'the
rest' may be referred, in accordance with the analogous rule of Manu, to
the 'ears, hide, bladder, tendons, the yellow concrete bile, and the
special proofs or marks.' Manu VIII, 234.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[143:18](sbe3338.htm#fr_425.md) Illness, however,
is considered as a legitimate reason for breaking an engagement of this
sort. Vîramitrodaya, p. 422, and other commentaries.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[143:21](sbe3338.htm#fr_426.md) The delivery of
the materials, out of which the house has been constructed, to the owner
of the ground, has to be regarded as a compensation for the ground
having been used without authorisation from the owner.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[144:22](sbe3338.htm#fr_427.md) This rule applies
in the case of water-jars and the like having been injured or destroyed.
Vîramitrodaya, p.421. The Ratnâkara refers this paragraph to broken
carriages and the like. See Colebrooke's Digest, III, I, 104. 'Spoiled,'
i.e. partially disfigured. 'Destroyed,' i.e. entirely ruined.
'Accident,' when the things have been knocked against one another.
Vîramitrodaya, ibid.
