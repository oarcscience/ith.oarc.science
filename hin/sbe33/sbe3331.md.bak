#### 24. The Ordeal by Sacred Libation.

\* 327. <span id="fr_334"></span>[327](#fn_334.md) Now I shall proclaim the
excellent rule regarding the ordeal by sacred libation, as it has been
laid down, for all seasons indiscriminately, by learned men.

\* 328. <span id="fr_335"></span>[328](#fn_335.md) The consecrated water
shall be given, early in the morning, to a virtuous man, who believes in
God. He must have fasted and bathed, and wear his wet clothes.

\* 329. The defendant should be made to drink three mouthfuls of water
in which (an image of) the deity whom he holds sacred has been bathed
and worshipped.

\* 330. <span id="fr_336"></span>[330](#fn_336.md) If he should meet
himself with any calamity

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

within a week or a fortnight (after having undergone this ordeal), it
shall be regarded as proof of his guilt.

\* 331. If a great misfortune even should befall him after the lapse of
a fortnight, he must not be harassed by any one, because the fixed
period has elapsed.

\* 332. <span id="fr_337"></span>[332](#fn_337.md) The drinking of
consecrated water should be avoided in the case of great criminals,
irreligious or ungrateful men, eunuchs, low rascals, unbelievers,
Vrâtyas, and slaves.

333. <span id="fr_338"></span>[333](#fn_338.md) A righteous king, who
administers the five ordeals to persons charged with a crime in the way
which has been stated, acquires prosperity both in a future state and in
this life.

\* 334. The ordeal by water is destined for the hot season. The ordeal
by poison (should be administered) in very cold weather. A Brahman
should be tested by the balance, fire is reserved for the Kshatriya.

\* 335. The ordeal by water should be administered to the Vai*s*ya.
Poison should be given to the *S*idra. He must not give poison to the
Brahman, nor should a Kshatriya take the (hot) iron.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

336\. The (five) ordeals, ending with the sacred libation and beginning
with the balance, should be administered in the case of heavy charges.
One hundred and fifty (Pa*n*as) should be given (to the defendant) if he
has been acquitted. One who has not been acquitted is liable to
punishment.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_334"></span>[116:327](sbe3331.htm#fr_334.md) 327-333. Vish*n*u
XIV; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 112, I13

327\. The ordeal by sacred libation is performed by swallowing three
mouthfuls of consecrated water in which an idol has been bathed. The
defendant is declared innocent, if no misfortune befalls him within a
certain period after this trial.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[116:328](sbe3331.htm#fr_335.md) Immoral persons
and infidels must not be subjected to this ordeal, because they are
already deprived of the assistance of the gods in every case. A. Read
pûrvâh*n*e in the text.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[116:330](sbe3331.htm#fr_336.md) If any misfortune
should happen to him, through the act of the king or through fate, it
shall be taken as proof of his guilt. A. Other legislators refer in
particular to illness, fire, death <span id="page_117">p. 117</span> of
a relation, or punishment inflicted by the king. Nor is every sort of
disease to be considered as proof of guilt. It is obvious that the
inclusion of a punishment inflicted by the king among the proofs of
guilt tends to place the defendant at the mercy of the sovereign power.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[117:332](sbe3331.htm#fr_337.md) All the various
categories of persons that are mentioned here as unfit for the
performance of this ordeal are so because they are already deprived of
the assistance of the gods in every case. A. Vrâtyas, those who have not
been invested with the thread.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[117:333](sbe3331.htm#fr_338.md) The term 'persons
charged with a crime' may denote both real offenders, whose offence has
remained secret, and wrongly accused persons. A.
