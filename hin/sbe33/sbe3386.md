### ADDENDA.

P. [231](sbe3350.htm#page_231.md), Appendix v. 56. This difficult text,
together with an additional text, is quoted in a somewhat different, but
equally faulty form, in the recently published last fasciculus of the
Vivâdaratnâkara in the Bibliotheca Indica. I propose to render the two
texts as follows: 'Fines beginning with a Kârshâpa*n*a may amount to
four Kârshâpa*n*as at most (in heavy cases); there are others beginning
with two and rising to eight, or beginning with three and rising to
twelve Kârshâpa*n*as. All those (fines) which have been declared to
begin with one Kârshâpa*n*a may be raised to the fourfold amount; the
same rule applies to the other fines as well, excepting the highest fine
(which consists of 2500 Pa*n*as).'

P. [369](sbe3382.htm#page_369.md), *after* v. 14, *add* '15. A wife should
be honoured by her husband with (presents of) clothes, ornaments, and
food; and at a festival (she should receive similar presents) from her
father and brothers, her parents-in-law, and other relations.'

P. [369](sbe3382.htm#page_369), *after* note [12](sbe3382.htm#fn_1218.md)
