#### 4. Means of Livelihood for a Brahman in Times of Distress.

56. <span id="fr_165"></span>[56](#fn_165.md) In times of distress, a
Brahman is allowed to gain his substance in the mode prescribed for the
caste next to him in rank; or he may gain his substance like a Vai*s*ya.
But he must never resort to

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

the mode of livelihood prescribed for a member of the lowest caste.

57. <span id="fr_166"></span>[57](#fn_166.md) At no time must a Brahman
follow the occupations of a man of vile caste, or a vile man the
occupations of a Brahman. In either case, expulsion from caste would be
the immediate consequence.

\* 58. <span id="fr_167"></span>[58](#fn_167.md) For neither of them are
such occupations permitted as are either far above or far below their
own rank. Those two occupations are lawful for them which lie between
these two extremes; for they are common to all (castes).

59. <span id="fr_168"></span>[59](#fn_168.md) When a Brahman has lived
through the times of distress, with the wealth acquired by following the
occupations of a Kshatriya, he must perform a penance and relinquish the
occupations of a Kshatriya.

60. <span id="fr_169"></span>[60](#fn_169.md) When, however, a Brahman
takes delight in those occupations and persists in them, he is declared
a Kâ*nd*ap*ri*sh*th*a (professional soldier) and must be expelled from
society, because he has swerved from the path of duty.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

61. <span id="fr_170"></span>[61](#fn_170.md) When a Brahman is living by
the occupations of a Vai*s*ya, he must never sell milk, sour milk,
clarified butter, honey, beeswax, lac, pungent condiments, liquids used
for flavouring, spirituous liquor,

62. <span id="fr_171"></span>[62](#fn_171.md) Meat, boiled rice, sesamum,
linen, the juice of the Soma plant, flowers, fruit, precious stones,
men, poison, weapons, water, salt, cakes, plants,

63. <span id="fr_172"></span>[63](#fn_172.md) Garments, silk, skins, bone,
blankets made of the hair of the mountain-goat, animals whose foot is
not cloven, earthen pots, buttermilk, hair, dregs, vegetables, fresh
ginger, and herbs.

64. <span id="fr_173"></span>[64](#fn_173.md) A Brahman may sell dry wood
and (dry) grass, excepting fragrant substances, Erakâ grass, ratan,
mulberry, roots, and Ku*s*a grass.

65\. (He may sell) twigs of bamboo that have fallen spontaneously, of
fruits, the fruits of the jujube tree,

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

and of the Iṅguda plant, ropes, and thread of cotton, if its shape has
not been altered (by working it up).

66\. If it is for a medicament used to cure a disease, or for an
offering, or if necessity can be shown, he may sell sesamum for a
corresponding quantity of grain.

67\. A Brahman who swerves from the path of duty by selling prohibited
articles, must be reminded of his duty by the king by inflicting a
severe chastisement on him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_165"></span>[55:56](sbe3311.htm#fr_165.md) 'The class next to
him in rank,' i.e. the Kshatriya or warrior caste. If he should find
himself unable to support his family by the mode of livelihood of his
own caste, he may gain his substance like a Kshatriya. At the time of a
drought or famine, he may gain his substance like a Vai*s*ya even. 'The
lowest caste,' i.e. the *S*ûdra caste. A. Manu X, 81, 82; Vish*n*u II,
15; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 35; Gautama VII, 6, 7; Baudhâyana II, 4, 16, &c.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[56:57](sbe3311.htm#fr_166.md) By the term 'a vile
man,' a member of the *S*ûdra caste is referred to. The occupations of
such a man, i.e. the acceptance of food from everybody and the sale of
all sorts of commodities, must never be resorted to by a Brahman, even
in times of distress. And so must a *S*ûdra avoid the occupation of a
Brahman, such as wearing the sacred thread, study of the Vedas,
pronouncing sacred benedictions, offering burnt-oblations, and the rest.
A.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[56:58](sbe3311.htm#fr_167.md) 'Such occupations
as are either far above or far below their own rank,' i.e. the
occupations of a Brahman and of a *S*ûdra respectively. 'Those two
occupations,' i.e. those peculiar to the Kshatriya and Vai*s*ya. A.
hitvâ seems a faulty reading (for hite).

<span id="fn_168"></span>[56:59](sbe3311.htm#fr_168.md) Yâ*gñ*avalkya III,
35.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[56:60](sbe3311.htm#fr_169.md) 'Ejected from
society,' i.e. he must not be admitted to obsequial repasts and other
religious ceremonies. A.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[57:61](sbe3311.htm#fr_170.md) 61-66. Manu X,
85-90; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 36-39; Gautama VII, 8-22; Vasish*th*a II,
24-31; Âpastamba I, 7, 20, 11 foll.

61\. 'Pungent condiments,' such as sugar. 'Liquids,' such as clarified
butter and oil. A.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[57:62](sbe3311.htm#fr_171.md) A. explains the
term Soma, 'the juice of the Soma plant,' which is offered to the gods
at a sacrifice, as denoting sacrificial implements generally; 'men,'
i.e. servants; 'plants,' i.e. shrubs, creeping plants, and others. A.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[57:63](sbe3311.htm#fr_172.md) 'Blankets,' i.e.
what is made of wool. 'Animals whose foot is not cloven,' i.e.
whole-hoofed animals, such as horses. 'Dregs,' i.e. the deposit of oil.
'Vegetables,' i.e. fresh pot-herbs. A.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[57:64](sbe3311.htm#fr_173.md) 'Fragrant
substances,' such as the fragrant root of the plant Andropogon
Muricatus, Bâlaka, the root of the Musta grass, and others. A. If the
reading of a single MS. be followed, the sale of the articles enumerated
in pars. 64 and 65 is also prohibited for a Brahman. Several of these
articles are included among those substances the sale of which is
prohibited by other. legislators. See Manu X, 86-89; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III,
36-39. However, the reading translated above is distinctly supported by
the Commentary of Asahâya, and by the analogous rules of Vasish*th*a.
