#### 3. Property.

43. <span id="fr_156"></span>[43](#fn_156.md) All transactions depend on
wealth. In order to acquire it, exertion is necessary. To preserve it,

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

to increase it, and to enjoy it: these are, successively, the three
sorts of activity in regard to wealth.

44. <span id="fr_157"></span>[44](#fn_157.md) Again, wealth is of three
kinds: white, spotted, and black. Each of these (three) kinds has seven
subdivisions.

\* 45. <span id="fr_158"></span>[45](#fn_158.md) White wealth is (of the
following seven sorts): what is acquired by sacred knowledge, valour in
arms, the practice of austerities, with a maiden, through (instructing)
a pupil, by sacrificing, and by inheritance. The gain to be derived from
exerting oneself to acquire it is of the same description.

\* 46. <span id="fr_159"></span>[46](#fn_159.md) Spotted wealth is (of the
following seven sorts): what is acquired by lending money at interest,
tillage, commerce, in the shape of *S*ulka, by artistic performances, by
servile attendance, or as a return for a benefit conferred on some one.

\* 47. <span id="fr_160"></span>[47](#fn_160.md) Black wealth is (of the
following seven

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

sorts): what is acquired as a bribe, by gambling, by bearing a message,
through one afflicted with pain, by forgery, by robbery, or by fraud.

48. <span id="fr_161"></span>[48](#fn_161.md) It is in wealth that
purchase, sale, gift, receipt, transactions of every kind, and
enjoyment, have their source.

49. <span id="fr_162"></span>[49](#fn_162.md) Of whatever description the
property may be, with which a man performs any transaction, of the same
description will the fruit be which he derives from it in the next world
and in this..

50\. Wealth is again declared to be of twelve sorts, according to the
caste of the acquirer. Those modes of acquisition, which are common to
all castes, are threefold. The others are said to be ninefold.

51\. Property obtained by inheritance, gifts made from love, and what
has been obtained with a wife (as her dowry), these are the three sorts
of pure wealth, for all (castes) without distinction.

52. <span id="fr_163"></span>[52](#fn_163.md) The pure wealth peculiar to a
Brahman is

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

declared to be threefold: what has been obtained as alms, by
sacrificing, and through (instructing) a pupil.

53\. The pure wealth peculiar to a Kshatriya is of three sorts likewise:
what has been obtained in the shape of taxes, by fighting, and by means
of the fines declared in lawsuits.

54\. The pure wealth peculiar to a Vai*s*ya is also declared to be
threefold: (what has been acquired) by tillage, by tending cows, and by
commerce. For a *S*ûdra it consists of what is given to him by the
members of the three higher castes.

55. <span id="fr_164"></span>[55](#fn_164.md) These are the legitimate
modes of acquisition of wealth for all the (four) castes severally. If
one caste should take to the occupations of another caste, it is a
criminal proceeding, except in extreme cases of distress.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_156"></span>[52:43](sbe3310.htm#fr_156.md) 'All transactions,'
whether originating in virtue, interest, or love. The rule regarding the
acquisition (and enjoyment) of wealth is said to be threefold:
protection against bipeds, quadrupeds, <span id="page_53">p. 53</span>
&c.; increase, through agriculture, lending at interest, trading, and
other modes of acquisition; enjoyment of terrestrial and celestial
pleasures. A.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[53:44](sbe3310.htm#fr_157.md) 44-54. Vish*n*u,
chapter LVIII.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[53:45](sbe3310.htm#fr_158.md) 'What is acquired
by sacred knowledge,' i.e. the gains of sacred study. What is gained by
'the practice of austerities,' i.e. by one who duly performs greater and
minor observances, optional and regular rites, and on whom worthy people
bestow alms for that reason. What is received 'with a maiden,' i.e. as
her marriage portion. The fruit derived from relinquishing white
property is of the same kind, i.e. it is pure likewise. Thus A.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[53:46](sbe3310.htm#fr_159.md) 'Commerce,' the
sale of merchandise. '*S*ulka,' the price obtained for giving a damsel
in marriage, whether the transaction be lawful or otherwise. 'Artistic
performances,' the art of painting or another art. 'Servile attendance,'
waiting upon, and paying homage to, another man. Wealth obtained by one
of these seven modes is called spotted, i.e. of a middling kind. A.
Others explain the ambiguous term Sulka differently, as denoting tolls,
or a fare for crossing a river, &c.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[53:47](sbe3310.htm#fr_160.md) 'Gambling,' with
dice or otherwise. 'One afflicted with <span id="page_54">p. 54</span>
pain,' one pained by an attack of disease. 'Forging,' falsification, of
gold, silver, or other metals. 'Robbery,' such as theft. 'Fraud,'
deception. What has been acquired by one of these seven kinds is called
'black wealth,' i.e. wealth of the lowest kind. A.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[54:48](sbe3310.htm#fr_161.md) From these three
kinds of wealth, with their twenty-one subdivisions, spring all the
various kinds of transactions, and all kinds of enjoyment. A.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[54:49](sbe3310.htm#fr_162.md) The difference
between this and the previous classification of the divers modes of
acquisition seems to lie in this, that the one system of classification
is solely based on the respective legitimacy or illegitimacy of each
mode of acquisition, whereas the diversity of caste represents the
principle of classification in the other system. It should be borne in
mind that an occupation, according to Indian notions, may be perfectly
lawful for one caste, though it is unlawful for all others.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[54:52](sbe3310.htm#fr_163.md) 52-54. Manu I,
88-91, X, 74-80 Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 118-120; Vish*n*u II, 4-14; Âpastamba
I, 1, 1, 5-6; Gautama X, 2, 7, 49, 56; Vasish*th*a II, 13-20; Baudhâyana
I, 18, 1-5.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[55:55](sbe3310.htm#fr_164.md) Here ends the
section of the divers kinds of wealth in the law of debt. A.
