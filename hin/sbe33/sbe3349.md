# EIGHTEENTH TITLE OF LAW.

##### MISCELLANEOUS.

\* 1. <span id="fr_645"></span>[1](#fn_645.md) Under the head of
Miscellaneous (Disputes) are comprised lawsuits depending on the king,
(such as) transgression of the king's commandments and obedience towards
his injunctions,

\* 2. <span id="fr_646"></span>[2](#fn_646.md) Grants of towns, the
division of the constituent elements of a state, the duties and the
reverse of heretics, followers of the Veda, corporations (of merchants),
and assemblages (of kinsmen).

\* 3. Disputes between father and son, neglect of (prescribed) penances,
abstraction of gifts (made to worthy persons), the wrath of anchorites,

\* 4. Sinful confusion of castes, the rules regarding their means of
subsistence, and (in short) whatever

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

has been omitted in the preceding (titles of law), are treated under the
head of Miscellaneous.

5. <span id="fr_647"></span>[5](#fn_647.md) The king shall be careful to
protect all orders and the constituent elements of his state with the
four means indicated by science.

6. <span id="fr_648"></span>[6](#fn_648.md) When any caste should remain
(behind the rest) or exceed the limits (assigned to it, the king),
seeing that it has strayed from its path, shall bring it back to the
path (of duty).

7. <span id="fr_649"></span>[7](#fn_649.md) So also, when other wicked
acts, opposed to the dictates of the sacred law, have been committed,
the king, after having reflected (upon the matter) himself, shall
inflict punishment on those who deserve it.

8\. What is opposed to revealed and traditional law, or injurious to
living beings, must not be practised by the king; and when it is
practised (by others), he must check it.

\* 9. When an act contrary to justice has been undertaken by a former
king from folly, he must redress that iniquitous enactment in accordance
with the principles of equity.

\* 10. <span id="fr_650"></span>[10](#fn_650.md) The weapons of soldiers,
the tools of artizans, the ornaments of public women, the various
musical or other instruments of professional (musicians, or other
artists, &c.),

\* 11. And any implements by which artificers gain

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

their substance, must not be laid hold on by the king, even when he
confiscates the entire property (of a man or woman).

12\. It is not permitted to either advise or rebuke a king or Brahman,
on account of their dignity and sanctity, unless they should swerve from
the path (of duty).

13\. That wicked man who does not act up to the laws proclaimed by the
king, shall be fined and corporally punished, as offending against the
king's commandments.

14. <span id="fr_651"></span>[14](#fn_651.md) If the king were remiss in
dictating punishments to (members of) any caste, when they have left the
path (of duty), the created beings of this world would perish.

15\. Brahmans would leave the sacerdotal caste, and Kshatriyas would
forsake the Kshatriya caste. The stronger would eat up the weaker, like
fish on a spit.

16. <span id="fr_652"></span>[16](#fn_652.md) The Vai*s*yas would abandon
their work, and the *S*ûdras eclipse all (the rest), if the kings did
not visit their subjects with punishment (when they have committed an
offence).

17\. To show favour to the virtuous at all times and to oppress the
wicked, that is declared to be the duty of kings; gain (results to them)
from the oppression of their foes.

18\. As fire is not polluted even though it always burns the creatures
of this world, even so a king is not polluted by inflicting punishment
on those who deserve it.

19. <span id="fr_653"></span>[19](#fn_653.md) Intelligence is the glory of
rulers; it becomes

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

manifest in their speeches; whatever sentence they may pass, whether
unjust or just, settles the law between litigant parties.

20\. (Law) personified as a king, roams on earth visibly, with a
thousand eyes. Mortals cannot live at all if they transgress his
commandments.

21\. Whatever a king does is right, that is a settled rule; because the
protection of the world is entrusted to him, and on account of his
majesty and benignity towards living creatures.

22\. As a husband though feeble must be constantly worshipped by his
wives, in the same way a ruler though worthless must be (constantly)
worshipped by his subjects.

23\. In order that mortals, fearing the orders issued by kings, might
not swerve from the path of duty, therefore royal orders are declared to
arise from lawsuits.

24. <span id="fr_654"></span>[24](#fn_654.md) It is for the establishment
of order that various laws (*k*aritra) have been proclaimed by kings. A
royal order is declared to overrule such laws even.

25\. A ruler has purchased his subjects through (the practice of)
austerities; therefore the king is their lord. For that reason, his
bidding must be obeyed; their livelihood even depends on the king.

26. <span id="fr_655"></span>[26](#fn_655.md) Kings, endowed with immense
power, appear (variously) in the five different forms of Agni, Indra,
Soma, Yama, and the God of Riches.

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

27. <span id="fr_656"></span>[27](#fn_656.md) When a ruler is, either
justly or without (sufficient) reason, ardent in wrath and burns (or
torments) his subjects, he is called Agni (the god of fire).

28. <span id="fr_657"></span>[28](#fn_657.md) When, relying on his regal
power, the king attacks his foes, desirous of victory and upraising a
weapon, he is termed Indra.

29. <span id="fr_658"></span>[29](#fn_658.md) When, free from ardent wrath,
he appears before his subjects with a cheerful countenance, he is
denoted Soma (the Moon).

30. <span id="fr_659"></span>[30](#fn_659.md) When the king having seated
himself, full of majesty, on the throne of judgment, deals out
punishment, equitable towards all creatures, he is called Vaivasvata (or
Yama).

31\. When a ruler gladdens with gifts petitioners, persons commanding
respect, wise men, servants and others, he is called the God of Riches.

32\. Therefore one must not treat him with contempt, and, particularly,
not scold at him, and pay obedience to his bidding; to disobey him would
bring on (instantaneous) death.

33. <span id="fr_660"></span>[33](#fn_660.md) His duties are, the
protection of his subjects, honouring the aged and wise, the trial of
lawsuits, and to make (each caste) abide by the duties assigned to it.

34. <span id="fr_661"></span>[34](#fn_661.md) Let a king be constantly
intent on showing honour to the Brahmans. A field furnished with
Brahmans is the root of the prosperity of the world.

35. <span id="fr_662"></span>[35](#fn_662.md) A Brahman may command
respect, and a

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

distinguished seat at the king's court. The king shall show his face in
the morning before the Brahmans first of all, and shall salute them all.

36. <span id="fr_663"></span>[36](#fn_663.md) When nine or seven persons
(of different rank) meet, they shall first make room for the Brahman to
pass by. (Further privileges assigned to the Brahman caste are) free
access to the houses of other people, for the purpose of begging alms,

37. <span id="fr_664"></span>[37](#fn_664.md) The right to collect fuel,
flowers, water, and the like, without its being regarded as theft, and
to converse with other men's wives, without being restrained (in such
intercourse) by others,

38. <span id="fr_665"></span>[38](#fn_665.md) And the right to cross rivers
without paying any fare, and to be conveyed (to the other bank) before
other people. When engaged in trading and using a ferry-boat, they shall
have to pay no toll.

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

39. <span id="fr_666"></span>[39](#fn_666.md) A Brahman engaged in
travelling, who is tired and has nothing to eat, commits no wrong by
taking himself two canes of sugar or two esculent roots.

40. <span id="fr_667"></span>[40](#fn_667) (No gift must be accepted.md)
from one accused of a crime, an outcast, an enemy, an atheist, one in
distress, without necessity, or after inflicting pain on the giver.

41\. (Gifts shall be accepted) from industrious people on account of
their wealth, and from generous people because it is proper to accept
gifts from such; to accept gifts from kings is laudable; (they may be
accepted) from all people excepting Brahmans.

42\. Between a Brahman and a king, who are both devoted to their duty,
there is no difference of any sort, when they protect mankind (acting)
in accordance with the sacred law.

43\. If a ruler, though severe, is mindful of his duty, correct in his
conduct, and (quick to) punish the wicked, in order to protect (the
virtuous), his wealth is declared to be pure.

44. <span id="fr_668"></span>[44](#fn_668.md) When a man accepts a gift
from a covetous king, who transgresses the precepts of the sacred books,
he shall have to pass through the well-known twenty-one hells in
succession.

45. <span id="fr_669"></span>[45](#fn_669.md) As pure and impure waters
become alike on their junction in the ocean, even so (all) property
acquired by a king (becomes pure in his hands).

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

46\. As gold, on being thrown into blazing fire, acquires purity, even
so all gains become pure in the hands of kings.

47\. When any man gives any property of his to Brahmans, the king must
give his consent to it; this is an eternal law.

48. <span id="fr_670"></span>[48](#fn_670.md) Both the other customary
receipts of a king and what is called the sixth of the produce of the
soil, form the royal revenue, the reward (of a king) for the protection
of his subjects.

49\. Whatever has been bestowed on others than Brahmans may be resumed;
but that which has been given to Brahmans can never be taken back again.

50. <span id="fr_671"></span>[50](#fn_671.md) To give, to read, and to
sacrifice (on his own account) are the three duties of a Brahman. To
sacrifice for others, to teach, and, thirdly, to collect alms are his
(three) means of subsistence.

51\. Let a Brahman be devoted to his duty and take a livelihood from the
king, and let him not accept gifts from persons of vile origin, if he is
anxious to observe the law.

52\. How should a king be inferior to a deity, as it is through his word
that an offender may become innocent, and an innocent man an offender in
due course?

53\. Those who being acquainted with the divine nature of a king,
endowed with majestic dignity as he is, accept gifts from him, do not in
the least disgrace themselves (by doing so).

54\. In this world, there are eight sacred objects:

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

a Brahman, a cow, fire, gold, clarified butter, the sun, the waters, and
a king as the eighth.

55\. These one must always look up to, worship and honour them
personally, and turn the right side towards them, in order that one's
existence may be prolonged.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_645"></span>[214:1](sbe3349.htm#fr_645.md) XVIII, 1-4. The
meagre contents of this title of law can hardly he said to be in keeping
with the somewhat pompous announcement contained in paragraphs 1-4. On
the whole, this title of Miscellanies, as defined by Nârada and
B*ri*haspati, may be described as treating of public law or the law of
kings (râ*g*adharma), private law being treated in the seventeen other
titles of law.

1\. 'Obedience towards his injunctions,' thus according to the
Mitâksharâ, p. 351. The Vîramitrodaya refers the term tatkarmakara*n*am
to those who, from arrogance, do such acts as are permitted to a king
only, such as e.g. placing themselves on the king's throne.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[214:2](sbe3349.htm#fr_646.md) 'Grants of towns,'
i.e. to Brahmans and others. Nârada seems to be referring to the
so-called Agrahâras. Regarding the seven constituent parts of a state,
see Manu VII, 157; IX, 294. Naigama has been translated 'followers of
the Veda,' because it comes immediately after pâsha*nd*i, 'heretics.'
See, too, X, 1. It usually denotes citizens or traders.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[215:5](sbe3349.htm#fr_647.md) 'The four means' of
conciliation, division, bribery, and force. Manu VIII, 41.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[215:6](sbe3349.htm#fr_648.md) Yâ*gñ*avalkya I,
360. The Nepalese MS. offers a variation as regards the arrangement of
paragraphs 6-11.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[215:7](sbe3349.htm#fr_649.md) Manu VII, 16; VIII,
126; Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 367; Vasish*th*a XIX, 8; Vish*n*u III, 37.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[215:10](sbe3349.htm#fr_650.md) For 'the tools of
artizans' the Nepalese MS., in common with the Mitâksharâ, has 'the
beasts of burden and the like of carriers of goods.'

<span id="fn_651"></span>[216:14](sbe3349.htm#fr_651.md) 14, 15. Manu VII,
20.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[216:16](sbe3349.htm#fr_652.md) Manu VII, 21, 24.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[216:19](sbe3349.htm#fr_653.md) For 'intelligence'
the Nepalese MS. has 'a royal edict.'

<span id="fn_654"></span>[217:24](sbe3349.htm#fr_654.md) *K*aritra seems to
mean 'law' or 'custom' in this place. Regarding the comparative
authority of *k*aritra and râ*g*a*s*âsana, 'a royal order,' see [p.
7](sbe3305.htm#page_7), note [11](sbe3305.htm#fn_30.md). The Nepalese MS.
omits 23, 24.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[217:26](sbe3349.htm#fr_655.md) Read rûpâ*n*i in
the text.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[218:27](sbe3349.htm#fr_656.md) Manu IX, 310.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[218:28](sbe3349.htm#fr_657.md) Manu IX, 304.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[218:29](sbe3349.htm#fr_658.md) Manu IX, 309.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[218:30](sbe3349.htm#fr_659.md) Manu IX, 307.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[218:33](sbe3349.htm#fr_660.md) Manu VII, 35, 38;
VIII, 3, &c.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[218:34](sbe3349.htm#fr_661.md) Manu VII, 82, 83;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 314.

<span id="fn_662"></span>[218:35](sbe3349.htm#fr_662.md) Manu VII, 37.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[219:36](sbe3349.htm#fr_663.md) That privilege of
the Brahman caste, which is referred to in the first part of this
paragraph, finds its explanation in a well-known rule of the
Dharma*s*âstra regarding persons for whom way must be made, on meeting
them in a road. Thus it is ruled by Gautama (VI, 24) that way must be
made for a man seated in a carriage, for one who is in his tenth
(decade), for one requiring consideration, for a woman, for a Snâtaka,
and for a king; but that a king himself must make way for a *S*rotriya
(learned Brahman). This makes in all seven persons for whom way should
be made. Manu (II, 138), Yâ*gñ*avalkya (I, 117), Baudhâyana (II, 6, 30),
and Vish*n*u (LXIII. 51) agree in enumerating eight persons of this
sort. Vasish*th*a (XIV, 57-60) mentions nine. See, too, Âpastamba II, 5,
11, 5-7.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[219:37](sbe3349.htm#fr_664.md) Manu VIII, 339;
Âpastamba I, 10, 28, 3; Gautama XII, 28; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 166.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[219:38](sbe3349.htm#fr_665.md) Manu VIII, 407;
Vish*n*u V, 132. The last clause is thus given in the Nepalese MS.:
'They shall have to pay no toll on being carried across a river in a
ferry, unless (they should cross it) for trading purposes.'

<span id="fn_666"></span>[220:39](sbe3349.htm#fr_666.md) Gautama XII, 49,
50; Manu VIII, 341. Or 'five esculent roots,' according to the Nepalese
MS.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[220:40](sbe3349.htm#fr_667.md) Manu II, 185.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[220:44](sbe3349.htm#fr_668.md) For a list of the
twenty-one hells, see Manu IV, 88-90; Vish*n*u XLIII, 1-22. The Nepalese
MS. omits this paragraph.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[220:45](sbe3349.htm#fr_669.md) A different
opinion has been enounced above, XV, 14.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[221:48](sbe3349.htm#fr_670.md) Manu VII, 130-132;
Gautama X, 24-27; Vasish*th*a XIX, 26, 27; Âpastamba II, 10, 26, 9;
Vish*n*u III, 22-25; Baudhâyana I, 10, 18, 1.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[221:50](sbe3349.htm#fr_671.md) Manu I, 88, &c.
