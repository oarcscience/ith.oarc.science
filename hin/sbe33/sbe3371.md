### XIII. SALE WITHOUT OWNERSHIP.

1. <span id="fr_1077"></span>[1](#fn_1076.md) Immediately after deposits,
sale by another person than the owner has been declared by Bh*ri*gu;
listen attentively, I will expound that subject thoroughly.

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

2. <span id="fr_1078"></span>[2](#fn_1077.md) An open deposit, a bailment
for delivery (Anvâhita), a Nyâsa (sealed) deposit, stolen property, a
pledge, or what has been borrowed for use: when any one of these
articles has been sold in secret by a man, he is declared a person
different from the owner (asvâmin).

3. <span id="fr_1079"></span>[3](#fn_1078.md) When the vendor has been
produced and has been cast in the suit, (the judge) shall cause him to
pay the price and a fine to the buyer and king respectively, and to
restore the property to the owner.

4. <span id="fr_1080"></span>[4](#fn_1079.md) When the former owner comes
forward and makes good his claim to the thing bought, the vendor shall
be produced (by the purchaser); by doing so, the purchaser may clear
himself.

5. <span id="fr_1081"></span>[5](#fn_1080.md) That greedy man who covets
another man's property, without having any claim to it, shall be
compelled to pay twice the value (of the property claimed) as a fine, if
he is unable to prove his claim.

6. <span id="fr_1082"></span>[6](#fn_1081.md) When there is no evidence in
a suit, the king shall consider the character of the parties and pass a
decree himself, according to the equal, greater, or less (credibility of
the parties).

7. <span id="fr_1083"></span>[7](#fn_1082.md) When a purchase has been made
before an assembly of merchants, the king's officers being aware of it
(also), but from a vendor whose habitation is unknown; or when the
purchaser has deceased:

8\. The owner may recover his own property by

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

paying half the price (tendered), the custom in that case being that one
half of the value is lost to each of the two.

9\. A purchase from an unknown (vendor) is one fault (in that case);
want of care in keeping it is another; these two faults are viewed by
the wise as legitimate grounds of loss to each party.

10. <span id="fr_1084"></span>[10](#fn_1083.md) When a man purchases (a
commodity) at a fair price, and (the purchase) has been previously
announced to the king, there is no wrong about it; but he who makes a
fraudulent purchase is a thief.

11\. That should be known as a fraudulent purchase which is made at an
unreasonably low price, in the interior of a house, outside of the
village, at night, in secret, or from a dishonest person.

by the owner in the presence of credible persons.' I have translated the
reading of the Vîramitrodaya, 'previously announced to the king.' In 11,
the clause 'in secret' is omitted in the Vîramitrodaya.
