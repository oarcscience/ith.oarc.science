### V. THE TRIAL.

1. <span id="fr_911"></span>[1](#fn_910) When litigants are quarrelling
in a court of justice, the judges, after examining the answer, shall
adjudge the burden of proof to either of the two parties.

2\. The judges having heard both the plaint and the answer, and
determined to which party the burden of proof shall be adjudged, that
person shall substantiate the whole of his declaration by documents or
other proofs.

3\. The plaintiff shall prove his declaration, and

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

the defendant his special plea; victory in a previous trial shall be
proved by a document recording that victory.

4. <span id="fr_912"></span>[4](#fn_911) When people try to excite fear,
or to cause dissension, or terror (among the judges or witnesses), or to
throw (other) obstacles in their way, such litigants lose their suit.

5. <span id="fr_913"></span>[5](#fn_912) One who absconds after
receiving the summons; one who remains silent; one convicted (of a
crime) by the (depositions of) witnesses; and one who admits the
correctness of the charge: such are the four losers of their suit.

6. <span id="fr_914"></span>[6](#fn_913) One who absconds loses the suit
after three fortnights; one who remains silent, after a week; and one
convicted by the witnesses, or confessing his crime, all at once.

7\. He who announces witnesses and does not produce them afterwards,
within thirty days or three fortnights, suffers defeat in consequence.

8. <span id="fr_915"></span>[8](#fn_914) When a person has promised to
appear at a trial or for the performance of an ordeal, and does not make
his 'appearance, it must not be viewed as fraud.

9. <span id="fr_916"></span>[9](#fn_915) If an obstacle caused by fate
or the king should intervene during that time, he does not lose his
cause through the mere non-observance of the fixed period.

10. <span id="fr_917"></span>[10](#fn_916) Those (litigants) who make a
private arrangement with one another, when the plaint and the

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

answer have been delivered, and the judgment is about to be given, shall
be compelled to pay twice the amount (in dispute) as a fine.

11. <span id="fr_918"></span>[11](#fn_917) When the plaint and the
answer have been reduced to writing, and the trial has commenced, the
two parties may be welded together like two pieces of red-hot iron.

12. <span id="fr_919"></span>[12](#fn_918) While both .parties are in
suspense there regarding the (approaching declarations of the) witnesses
and judges, those litigants are clever who arrive at a mutual
understanding while the uncertainty lasts.

13\. When the evidence is equally strong on both sides, and law and
custom divided, in such a case a mutual reconciliation between the two
parties through royal order is recommended.

14\. Gain of religious merit and wealth, and renown accrues to the ruler
from an equitable decision; the witnesses and assessors are exempt from
censure, and enmity ceases,

15\. When an unfavourable or a favourable decree, punishment or praise,
renown or infamy has been obtained; whereas (continued) strife among men
leads to sin.

16\. Therefore should an intelligent (prince) enact that which has been
propounded by dutiful and equitable associations, corporations, and
chief judges, (in an impartial spirit) devoid of malice and avarice.

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

17. <span id="fr_920"></span>[17](sbe3364.htm#fn_921) Evidence is
declared to be twofold, human and divine. Each of these is again divided
into a number of branches by sages declaring the essence of things.

18\. Human evidence is threefold, as it consists of witnesses, writings,
and inference. Witnesses are of twelve sorts; writings are declared to
be tenfold; inference is twofold; divine test. is ninefold.

19. <span id="fr_921"></span>[19](#fn_919) In the case of an answer of
the first or third kinds, divine and human proof should be employed; but
in the case of an answer of the fourth kind, an attested document
recording the success of either party should be produced.

20. <span id="fr_922"></span>[20](#fn_920) In the cases of a plea of
former judgment and of a special plea, the defendant shall prove the
contents of his answer; but in the case of a denial, the plaintiff shall
prove the contents of the plaint.
