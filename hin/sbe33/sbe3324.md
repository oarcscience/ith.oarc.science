#### 17. Invalid Evidence.

230\. Where, however, an equal number of witnesses possessed of a good
memory is found on both sides, the evidence of the witnesses is entirely
valueless, on account of the subtle nature of the law of evidence.

231\. But wherever a litigant has been abandoned by his own witnesses
through the act of fate, the sages have declared that he cannot be
absolved by (the performance of) an ordeal even.

\* 232. Where, the time forgiving testimony having arrived, a witness
does not make a consistent statement with reference to the questions
under notice, his testimony is as good as ungiven.

\* 233. If the witnesses were to disagree with one another as to place,
time, age, matter, quantity, shape, and species, such testimony is
worthless likewise.

\* 234. If the witnesses wrongly name too low or too high a sum, this
too must be known to make no evidence. This is the rule of witnesses.
