### VI. THE JUDGMENT.

1. <span id="fr_923"></span>[1](#fn_922.md) He is said to have gained his
cause in this world who has proved his claim, and has been honourably
dismissed by the chief judge and the other judges, and received a
document recording his victory.

2. <span id="fr_924"></span>[2](#fn_923.md) Punishment corresponding to the
nature of the offence shall be ordained there (in the decree).

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

3. <span id="fr_925"></span>[3](#fn_924.md) Whatever has been transacted in
a suit, the plaint, answer, and so forth, as well as the gist of the
trial, should be noted completely in the document recording the success
(of the claimant or defendant).

4\. When the king gives the victorious party a document recording the
plaint, answer, and trial, and closing with the sentence, it is called a
document recording the success (of either party).

5. <span id="fr_926"></span>[5](#fn_925.md) When a man does not feel
satisfied with a decision passed by meetings of kindred or other
(resorts for the redress of wrongs), the king should revise the decision
declared by them, and institute a fresh trial, if it should prove
unjust.

6\. After having considered the matter in common with many Brahmans well
versed in science, he should punish the wicked men, who were acting as
judges in the former trial, together with the victorious party.

7. <span id="fr_927"></span>[7](#fn_926.md) One appointed by his master to
look after his expenses and to superintend (transactions regarding)
tillage, loans, and trade, is called a manager.

8\. Whatever has been transacted by him is valid, whether relating to
receipt, non-receipt, expenses or . income, and whether it may have been
transacted at home or abroad. The master must not annul such
transactions as these.
