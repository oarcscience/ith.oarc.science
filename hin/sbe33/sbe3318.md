#### 11. Witnesses.

\* 147. <span id="fr_242"></span>[147](#fn_242) In doubtful cases, when
two parties are quarrelling with one another, the truth has to be

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

gathered from (the deposition of) witnesses, whose knowledge is based on
what has been seen, heard, or understood by them.

148. <span id="fr_243"></span>[148](#fn_243) He should be considered as
a witness who has witnessed a deed with his own ears or eyes; with his
ears, if he has heard another man speaking; with his eyes, if he has
seen something himself.

\* 149. <span id="fr_244"></span>[149](#fn_244) Eleven descriptions of
witnesses are distinguished in law by the learned. Five of them are
termed appointed, and the other six not appointed.

\* 150. <span id="fr_245"></span>[150](#fn_245) A subscribing witness,
one who has been reminded, a casual witness, a secret witness, and an
indirect witness, these are the five sorts of appointed witnesses.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

\* 151. <span id="fr_246"></span>[151](#fn_246) The witnesses not
appointed by (the party) himself have been declared sixfold: viz. the
village, a judge, a king,

152\. One acquainted with the affairs of the two parties, and one
deputed by the claimant. In family quarrels, members of that family
shall be witnesses.

153. <span id="fr_247"></span>[153](#fn_247) They shall be of honourable
family, straightforward, and unexceptionable as to their descent, their
actions, and their fortune. The witnesses shall not be less than three
in number, unimpeachable, honest, and pure-minded.

154. <span id="fr_248"></span>[154](#fn_248) They shall be Brahmans,
Vai*s*yas, or Kshatriyas, or irreproachable *S*ûdras. Each of these
shall be (witness) for persons of his own order, or all of them may be
(witnesses) for all (orders).

\* 155. <span id="fr_249"></span>[155](#fn_249) Among companies (of
artizans, or guilds of

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

merchants, other) artizans or merchants shall be witnesses; and members
of an association among other members of the same association; persons
living outside among those living outside; and women among women.

\* 156. <span id="fr_250"></span>[156](#fn_250) And if in a company (of
artizans or guild of merchants) or in any other association any one
falls out (with his associates), they must not bear witness against him;
for they all are his enemies.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_242"></span>[79:147](sbe3318.htm#fr_242) When the plaintiff
and defendant in a lawsuit quarrel <span id="page_80">p. 80</span> about
a doubtful affair of any sort, the truth has to be ascertained by
examining the statements of the witnesses, who have seen, or heard, or
been present at, the transaction. A.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[80:148](sbe3318.htm#fr_243) Manu VIII, 74;
Vish*n*u VIII, 13.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[80:149](sbe3318.htm#fr_244) Definitions of the
eleven witnesses are given in the following paragraphs. A.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[80:150](sbe3318.htm#fr_245) 'A subscribing
witness,' i.e. one by whom a document is attested. 'A secret witness,'
one who concealed in a house or room listens to the discourse of the
parties. A. Kâtyâyana defines the technical terms in this paragraph as
follows: 'One adduced by the claimant himself, whose name is inserted in
the deed, is a subscribing witness. A reminded witness is not entered in
a deed. He is called a reminded witness who in order to insure the
publicity of a transaction is reminded of it again and again by the
claimant. One purposely brought near, and one who happened to be on the
spot accidentally, are two witnesses not entered in a deed, by whom a
claim may be corroborated. One who standing concealed is caused, for the
purpose of establishing the claim, to hear distinctly the statements of
the defendant, is termed a secret witness. One who subsequently
corroborates the statements of other witnesses, whether from his own
knowledge, or from hearsay, is called an indirect witness.'

<span id="fn_246"></span>[81:151](sbe3318.htm#fr_246) 151, 152. The
village or the co-villagers shall be witnesses in a transaction which
has taken place within the village. The testimony of the judge shall be
heard in regard to a cause tried in a court of justice. The king shall
be witness concerning a transaction which has taken place in his
presence. These, and one acquainted with the circumstances of both
parties, the agent of the claimant, and members of a family in a lawsuit
concerning that family, are the six kinds of witnesses not appointed. A.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[81:153](sbe3318.htm#fr_247) 'Of honourable
family,' belonging to a noble race. 'Straightforward,' habitually
veracious. 'Less than three,' viz. one or two persons may be witnesses
if both parties consent to it. In a dispute regarding landed property,
more than three witnesses are required. 'Honest,' free from avarice.
'Pure-minded,' imbued with the precepts of religion. A. Manu VIII, 62,
63; Vish*n*u VIII, 8; Âpastamba II, 11, 29, 7; Gautama XIII, 2;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 68, 69; Vasish*th*a XVI, 28.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[81:154](sbe3318.htm#fr_248) Members of these
four castes shall be witnesses for members of their own caste only. Or
let members of any caste be witnesses for members of any other caste. A.
Manu VIII, 62; Gautama XIII, 3; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 69; Vasish*th*a XVI,
29; Baudhâyana I,19, 53.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[81:155](sbe3318.htm#fr_249) Companies or
guilds are of eighteen kinds. Labourers <span id="page_82">p. 82</span>
for hire shall be witnesses for other members of the same association.
Outcasts shall be witnesses for other low-caste persons. Women shall be
witnesses where two women quarrel with one another. In all these cases,
the qualities of the witnesses need not be tested. A. Manu VIII, 68;
Vasish*th*a XVI, 30.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[82:156](sbe3318.htm#fr_250) If in a company of
traders any one member should contract an enmity towards the other
members of it, they are unworthy to bear testimony against or about him,
on account of their enmity towards him. Here ends the chapter on
witnesses, the tenth section of the law of debt. A.
