### III. THE ANSWER.

1. <span id="fr_734"></span>[1](#fn_733.md) When a plaint of this
description has been tendered by the plaintiff, the defendant shall
deliver an answer corresponding to such plaint.

2. <span id="fr_735"></span>[2](#fn_734) That is called a (true.md) answer
by those acquainted with the subject, which meets the plaint, and is
concise, clear, consistent, and easily intelligible without an
explanation.

3. <span id="fr_736"></span>[3](#fn_735.md) If a man's courage fails him
when he is about to make a statement in a lawsuit, a delay must be

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

granted to him (by the judge), whether he be plaintiff or defendant.

4. <span id="fr_737"></span>[4](#fn_736.md) When the defendant contradicts
the charge, such an answer is termed a denial in a cause.

5. <span id="fr_738"></span>[5](#fn_737.md) When, the plaint having been
reduced to writing by the plaintiff, the defendant admits it but adduces
some special circumstance, it is called a (retort in the form)
pratyavaskandana (special plea).

6. <span id="fr_739"></span>[6](#fn_738) That (answer) is no (true.md)
answer which is dubious, not to the point, too narrow, too extensive, or
meeting one part only of the plaint.

7\. An answer which treats of a different subject, or which is
incomplete, or couched in obscure language, or confused, not
intelligible without an explanation, or unreasonable, will never enable
(the defendant) to gain his cause.

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

8. <span id="fr_740"></span>[8](#fn_739.md) In the case of a denial, the
burden of proof rests with the plaintiff; in the case of a special plea,
(it rests) with the defendant.

9. <span id="fr_741"></span>[9](#fn_740) Let (the plaintiff.md) make an
answer which corresponds to (the contents of) the plaint. If he does not
(make an answer), the king shall cause him to make one, by employing
(any of) the (four) methods of conciliation, division, and the rest,
till the matter has been cleared up.

10. <span id="fr_742"></span>[10](#fn_741.md) When, in the case of a denial
(on the part of the defendant) the plaintiff himself admits such
(denial) as correct, it has to be considered as a confession, and one
half of the (ordinary) fine shall be inflicted on the plaintiff.

11. <span id="fr_743"></span>[11](#fn_742.md) In the case of a denial, the
burden of proof rests with the plaintiff; in the case of a special plea,

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

it rests with the defendant; but in a plea of former judgment, all that
is required in the shape of proof is to produce the previous decree.

12. <span id="fr_744"></span>[12](#fn_743.md) The defendant is at liberty
to delay his answer for three days, or for five days even.

man has received a hundred *S*uvar*n*as from me, (the defendant
replies): Yes, I have received a hundred *S*uvar*n*as or a hundred
Mâshas. 'Not to the point,' as when a debtor being sued for a hundred
Suvar*n*as, replies that he has received a hundred Pa*n*as. 'Too
narrow,' as when (a debtor) being sued for a hundred Suvar*n*as; replies
that he has received five. 'Too extensive,' as when (a debtor) being
sued for a hundred *S*uvar*n*as, replies that he has received two
hundred. 'Meeting one part only of the plaint,' as when (a debtor) being
sued for gold, clothes, and other objects, replies that he has received
gold but nothing else. 'Which treats of a different subject,' as when an
action for debt is answered by referring to a different title of law,
e.g. when a man being sued for a debt of a hundred *S*uvar*n*as,
replies, He (the plaintiff) has struck me. 'Incomplete,' not containing
any reference to the particulars of country, place, and so on, as when
the plaint states a certain field situated in the central country
(Madhyade*s*a) near Benares, towards the east of it, to have been seized
by the defendant, and the defendant replies merely, 'I <span
id="page_241">p. 241</span> have taken it.' 'Couched in obscure terms,'
as when in a suit for a hundred *S*uvar*n*as the defendant exclaims, 'Am
I the only person indebted to this man?' implying by his speech that the
chief judge, or assessors, or plaintiff, is indebted to another man.
'Confused,' inconsistent, as when in an action for a hundred
*S*uvar*n*as the defendant declares, 'Yes; I have received that sum, but
I do not owe it.' 'Not intelligible without an explanation,' owing to
the use of wrong inflections, compounds, or constructions, or to the
employment of a foreign language. 'Unreasonable,' contrary to common
sense, as when the plaint runs as follows: The defendant has received a
hundred *S*uvar*n*as from me, repayable with interest, and has paid the
interest only, and not the principal; and the defendant replies: 'Yes; I
have paid the interest, but have not received the principal.' M.
