#### 19. Proof by Ordeal.

\* 247. If no witness is forthcoming for either of the two litigant
parties, he must test them through ordeals and oaths of every sort.

\* 248. <span id="fr_292"></span>[248](#fn_292.md) (Let him cause a Brahman
to swear by) truth, (a Kshatriya) by his (horse or other) vehicle, and
by his weapons, (a Vai*s*ya) by his cows, seeds or gold and so on, (or
all) by venerable deities or deified ancestors, by their pious gifts or
meritorious deeds.

249. <span id="fr_293"></span>[249](#fn_293.md) Where a heavy crime has
been committed, the ruler shall administer one of the ordeals. In light
cases, on the other hand, a virtuous king shall swear a man with
(various) oaths.

\* 250. Thus have these oaths been proclaimed by Manu for trifling
cases. In a suit concerning a heavy crime, divine test should be
resorted to.

251. <span id="fr_294"></span>[251](#fn_294.md) Holy Manu has ordained that
five kinds of ordeals should be administered to those involved in a
doubtful case (which has become the object of a lawsuit), especially if
the matter under dispute is of a recondite nature.

\* 252. <span id="fr_295"></span>[252](#fn_295.md) The balance, fire,
water, poison, and, fifthly, consecrated water, are the ordeals ordained
for the purgation of high-minded persons.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

\* 253. <span id="fr_296"></span>[253](#fn_296) (Those ordeals.md) have
been ordained here by Nârada for the purpose of proving the innocence of
criminals who are defendants in a lawsuit, (and) in order that right may
be discerned from wrong.

\* 254. <span id="fr_297"></span>[254](#fn_297.md) During the rains let the
(ordeal by) fire be administered. In the autumn season the balance is
declared to be (the proper kind of ordeal). The (ordeal by) water should
be applied in summer, and the (ordeal by) poison in the cold weather.

\* 255. <span id="fr_298"></span>[255](#fn_298.md) The distressed shall not
be caused to undergo the (ordeal by) water, nor shall poison be given to
the bilious, nor shall the ordeal by fire be administered to persons
afflicted with white leprosy, or with blindness, or with bad nails.

\* 256. <span id="fr_299"></span>[256](#fn_299.md) An ordeal should never
be administered to persons engaged in performing a vow, to those
afflicted with a heavy calamity, to the diseased, to ascetics, or to
women, if the dictates of justice are listened to.

257. <span id="fr_300"></span>[257](#fn_300.md) Where no one declares
himself ready to

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

undergo punishment, an ordeal cannot take place. An ordeal shall be
administered to litigants where there is reason for it, but not
otherwise.

258. <span id="fr_301"></span>[258](#fn_301.md) Therefore an intelligent,
virtuous, righteous, and wise (king or chief judge) should abstain
carefully from administering any one out of the (five) ordeals, unless
both parties consent to it.

\* 259. <span id="fr_302"></span>[259](#fn_302.md) The ordeal by water must
not take place in the cold weather, nor the ordeal by fire in the hot
season, nor must the (ordeal by) poison be administered to any one
during the rains, nor the (ordeal by) balance in stormy weather.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_292"></span>[100:248](sbe3326.htm#fr_292.md) In this rule are
indicated the various oaths to be administered according to the caste
and individual character of the offender. A. Manu VIII, 114.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[100:249](sbe3326.htm#fr_293.md) 249, 250. These
two verses are intended to indicate the difference in point of
applicability between an ordeal and an oath. A.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[100:251](sbe3326.htm#fr_294.md) Holy Manu has
said that those against whom a charge of an aggravated nature has been
brought, shall have to undergo one out of the five ordeals, in order to
clear themselves from suspicion, especially when a secret transgression
is concerned. A.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[100:252](sbe3326.htm#fr_295.md) In this paragraph
the author proceeds to enumerate the five ordeals singly. A.
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 95; Vish*n*u IX, II.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[101:253](sbe3326.htm#fr_296.md) The five ordeals
have been proclaimed by the great sage Nârada, for the justification of
those impeached on account of their suspicious conduct, by showing where
the wrong lies and where not. A.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[101:254](sbe3326.htm#fr_297.md) The five ordeals
should be administered, each of them, at those very seasons, and not at
any other season. A. Vish*n*u IX, 25, 28, 30.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[101:255](sbe3326.htm#fr_298.md) 255, 256.
Vish*n*u IX, 23, 25, 27, 29.

255\. In the case of the persons here mentioned, the ordeals referred to
should be avoided, on grounds of disease and of incapacity to undergo
them. A.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[101:256](sbe3326.htm#fr_299.md) 'Persons engaged
in performing a vow,' those who have performed the ceremony initiatory
to a Soma sacrifice. A.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[101:257](sbe3326.htm#fr_300.md) An ordeal should
not take place, unless there should be a special reason for it, such as
an accusation. Therefore an ordeal must not be administered, unless
there be a plaintiff who declares himself ready to take the punishment
on himself in case of defeat. <span id="page_102">p. 102</span> A.
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 96; Vish*n*u IV, 20, 21. The reading na divya*m* (for
na vinâ?) seems wrong. Or translate, 'but there is no ordeal for
plaintiffs.'

<span id="fn_301"></span>[102:258](sbe3326.htm#fr_301.md) A king or
chief-judge, who is endowed with the qualities here mentioned, should
administer an ordeal with the full approval of both parties in a cause,
but not otherwise. A.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[102:259](sbe3326.htm#fr_302.md) The times or
seasons here referred to should be avoided in the case of the ordeal by
water and of the other ordeals, because they are illegal. A. Vish*n*u
IX, 24, 26, 28, 30.
