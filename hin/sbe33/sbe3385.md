### XXVII. MISCELLANEOUS (Prakîr*n*aka).

1. <span id="fr_1296"></span>[1](#fn_1295) This (aggregate of rules
concerning) lawsuits instituted by litigants has been briefly declared;
I will declare (next the law concerning) Miscellaneous Causes instituted
by the king (in person).

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

2. <span id="fr_1297"></span>[2](#fn_1296) In the case of a conflict
between two Sm*ri*tis (texts of law), equity should be resorted to; when
the law-books are inapplicable, that course should be followed which is
indicated by a consideration of the circumstances of the case.

3. <span id="fr_1298"></span>[3](#fn_1297) (However) the first rank
(among legislators) belongs to Manu, because he has embodied the essence
of the Veda in his work; that Sm*ri*ti (or text of law) which is opposed
to the tenor of the laws of Manu is not approved.

4. <span id="fr_1299"></span>[4](#fn_1298) When he has discovered a man
to be an offender, (the king) should inflict (one of the various sorts
of punishment) on him, (gentle) admonition, (harsh) reproof or corporal
chastisement, or one of the four gradations of fines.

5\. (Let him inflict) a (gentle) admonition, when the offence is very
light; (harsh) reproof, for a crime in the first degree; a fine, for a
crime in the (second or) middlemost degree; and arrest, in the case of
high-treason.

6\. Banishment also may be resorted to by (a king) desirous of promoting
his own welfare in order to meet opposition, and all (the various) sorts
(of punishment) should be united in the case of one who has committed a
mortal sin.

7\. (The king) should punish elders, domestic priests, and persons
commanding respect, with (gentle) admonition only; other litigants he
should amerce in a fine, when they are found to be guilty;

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

and on the perpetrators of a heavy crime he should inflict corporal
punishment.

8. <span id="fr_1300"></span>[8](#fn_1299) (Gentle) admonition and
(harsh) reproof are declared to be the privilege of the Brahman
(appointed as chief judge); but both fines and corporal punishment may
be inflicted by the king only.

9. <span id="fr_1301"></span>[9](#fn_1300) Both hands, both feet, the
male organ, the eye, the tongue, both ears, the nose, the neck, one half
of the feet, the thumb and index, the forehead, the lips, the hindpart,
and the hips:

10\. These fourteen places of punishment have been indicated. For a
Brahman, branding him on the forehead is ordained as the only kind of
punishment.

11. <span id="fr_1302"></span>[11](#fn_1301) A Brahman, though a mortal
sinner, shall not suffer capital punishment; the king shall banish him,
and cause him to be branded and shaved.

12. <span id="fr_1303"></span>[12](#fn_1302) That man who deserves
capital punishment shall be compelled to pay one hundred *S*uvar*n*as;
one deserving to have a limb cut off, half as much; and one deserving to
have the thumb and index (cut off), half of that.

13. <span id="fr_1304"></span>[13](#fn_1303) The eighteen titles of law
have been explained, together with the particulars of plaint and answer.
Learn now (the law regarding) the relative validity of transactions.

14\. That transaction which has been prior in time (to another) shall be
upheld. If it is departed from, that is (called) an alteration of a
transaction.

15\. If a creditor or debtor revokes a previous

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

agreement and makes another contract of the same description, (in which
a) greater or less (amount is stated), it is termed an alteration of a
transaction.

16\. When (a debtor) having received a loan at the rate of two per cent.
(in the month) promises to pay five per cent., that subsequent agreement
is valid.

17\. Between two successive transactions, the first is (rendered) void
(by the second); a subsequent agreement prevails over the one preceding
it in time.

18\. When a man first makes a deposit and converts it into a pledge
afterwards, after receiving money (for it), or sells it, the second
transaction prevails over the first.

\[19. <span id="fr_1305"></span>[19](#fn_1304) Forbidden practices are
found among the Southerners in the present day, (such as) matches with a
maternal uncle's daughter, in spite of the prohibited degree of
relationship on the mother's side (causing such unions to be illegal).

20\. The highly reprehensible custom of a brother living with his
deceased brother's wife, and the delivery of a marriageable damsel to a
family is found in other countries.

21\. What is more, matches with a mother occur among the Pârasîkas. The
inhabitants of some countries do not allow the presentation of fresh
gifts (of food) at a *S*râddha offering to those Brahmans who have been
fed at a *S*râddha held on the eleventh

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

day (after the decease of a person) or at some other *S*râddha.

22\. Others, after lending grain, take twice as much back in the autumn
season and occupy the embanked land, after having received twice the
amount lent,

23\. Though the principal has been repaid. This is reprehensible also.
Such forbidden practices (the king) should check (when they are resorted
to) through folly.

24\. Such customs as are not opposed to the laws of particular countries
and castes or other (corporations), every king should establish in
accordance with the sacred law, after consulting the law-books.\]

25. <span id="fr_1306"></span>[25](#fn_1305) Thus let the king every day
examine, in common with learned Brahmans, both the suits proffered by
litigants and those instituted by the king (himself).

26. <span id="fr_1307"></span>[26](#fn_1306) When the safety of many may
be effected by destroying a single offender, his, execution is
productive of religious merit (even).
