# NINTH TITLE OF LAW.

##### RESCISSION OF PURCHASE.

\* 1. When a purchaser, after having purchased an article for a
(certain) price, repents (of the purchase made by himself), it is termed
Rescission of Purchase, a title of law.

\* 2. When a purchaser, after having purchased an article for a
(certain) price, thinks he has made a foolish bargain, he may return it
to the vendor on the same day, in an undamaged condition.

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

\* 3. <span id="fr_441"></span>[3](#fn_441.md) When the purchaser returns
it on the second day (after the purchase has been made), he shall lose a
thirtieth part of the price. (He shall lose) twice as much on the third
day. After that time, the purchaser is bound to keep it.

\* 4. The (intending) purchaser shall first examine an article (before
purchasing it), in order to find out its good and bad qualities. That
which has been approved by the purchaser after close examination, cannot
be returned to the vendor.

\* 5. <span id="fr_442"></span>[5](#fn_442.md) Milch cattle may be examined
for three days; animals of burden, for five days; and in the case of
precious stones, pearls, and coral, the period of examination may extend
over seven days.

\* 6. Bipeds shall be examined within half a month; a female, within
twice the same (space of time); all sorts of grain, within ten days;
iron and clothes, within a single day.

\* 7. A worn gown, which is in a ragged condition and soiled with dirt,
cannot be returned to the vendor, if it was in that blemished state at
the time when the purchase was effected.

\* 8. <span id="fr_443"></span>[8](#fn_443.md) Wearing apparel loses the
eighth part of its value on being washed for the first time; the fourth

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

part (on being washed) for the second time; the third part (on being
washed) for the third time; and one half (on being washed) for the
fourth time.

\* 9. One half of the original value having been lost, a quarter (of the
reduced value) shall be deducted henceforth, till the fringe is tattered
and (the cloth) in rags. In the case of tattered cloth, there is no rule
regarding the reduction of its value (through being washed).

\* 10. There is no other way for preparing metallic apparatus of any
sort than by forging it in fire according to the rules (of art). While
they are being forged, (the weight of) the metals is diminished by
exposure in fire.

\* 11. <span id="fr_444"></span>[11](#fn_444.md) Gold is not injured at all
(by such treatment). On silver, the loss amounts to two Palas in the
hundred. On tin and lead, the loss is eight Palas in the hundred.

\* 12. On copper, as well as on utensils made of it, the loss should be
known to be five Palas (in the hundred). As for iron, there is no fixed
rule regarding the loss arising on it, because it is different in nature
from the other metals.

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

13. <span id="fr_445"></span>[13](#fn_445.md) The loss and gain arising
from the preparation of cloth shall be stated (next). On yarns made of
cotton or wool, the increase of value amounts to ten in the hundred.

14\. (This rule has reference) to large tissue (only). In the case of
(tissue of) middle size, five in the hundred (is gained). In the case of
very fine tissue, the gain is said to amount to three Palas in the
hundred.

15\. In the case of cloth made of the hair of an animal, and of
embroidered cloth, the loss amounts to one-thirtieth. In the case of
silk stuff and of cloth prepared from the inner bark of trees, the gain
is the same (as the loss in the preceding case). Nor is there any loss
(in these cases).

\* 16. <span id="fr_446"></span>[16](#fn_446.md) A merchant who is
acquainted with the qualities of the merchandise (he deals in) must not

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

annul a purchase, after having once made it. He ought to know all about
the profit and loss on merchandise, and its origin.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_441"></span>[150:3](sbe3341.htm#fr_441.md) IX, 3. 'He shall
lose a thirtieth part,' he shall give one-thirtieth part more than the
stipulated price. 'Twice as much,' i.e. a fifteenth. See Colebrooke's
Digest, III, 3, 5.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[150:5](sbe3341.htm#fr_442.md) 5, 6. 'For three
days,' including the day of purchase. The terms 'for five days,' &c.,
have to be interpreted in the same way. 'Milch cattle,' such as e.g.
female buffaloes. 'Animals of burden,' such as e.g. young bulls.
'Bipeds,' males, i.e. male slaves. 'Twice the same space of time,' a
month. 'A female,' a female slave. Vîramitrodaya, pp. 433, 434. Manu
VIII, 222; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 177.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[150:8](sbe3341.htm#fr_443.md) 8, 9. When apparel
has been given to a washerman to be washed by him, he is bound to make
good the value of that <span id="page_151">p. 151</span> which has been
spoiled by him. If it has been washed a single time, he must make good
its original value minus an eighth. if it has been washed twice, he must
make good its original value minus a fourth. Thus if it has been washed
three times, a third has to be deducted from the original value, and so
forth. Vîramitrodaya, p. 372.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[151:11](sbe3341.htm#fr_444.md) 11, 12. The value
of gold is not diminished on its being heated in fire. Therefore, as
much (gold) as has been delivered to a goldsmith for making a bracelet
and the like, thus much shall the goldsmith restore after having weighed
it. Otherwise, he shall be compelled to restore the loss, and to pay a
fine. When silver, a hundred Palas in weight, is heated in fire, the
loss amounts to <span id="page_152">p. 152</span> two Palas. When a
hundred Palas of tin or lead is heated in fire, the loss amounts to
eight Palas. In the case of copper, the loss shall be five Palas.
Artizans losing more than the above amount shall be punished.
Mitâksharâ, pp. 264, 265. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 178.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[152:13](sbe3341.htm#fr_445.md) 13-15. When a
blanket or the like is made of coarse woollen thread, the increase must
be considered to amount to ten Palas in the hundred. The same rule
applies in the case of cloth and the like made of cotton thread. In the
case of cloth and the like of a middling quality, i.e. which is not made
of very fine thread, the increase amounts to five Palas. In the case of
cloth made of very fine thread, the increase is three Palas in the
hundred. All these rules apply in the case of washed cloth only. That is
called 'embroidered cloth' (kârmika or karmak*ri*ta) where a circle,
Svastika, or other (figure) is worked on woven cloth, with coloured
yarns. 'Cloth made of the hair (of an animal)' is where hairs are joined
so as to form a piece of cloth or the like. Mitâksharâ, pp. 265, 266.
Manu VIII, 397; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 179, 180.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[152:16](sbe3341.htm#fr_446.md) 'He must not annul
a purchase,' he must not repent of it. 'He must know' before concluding
a purchase, the 'loss and gain on merchandise,' such as horses or
others, i.e. the diminution of <span id="page_153">p. 153</span> its
value in one country, and the increase of its value in another country,
and 'its origin,' the country where it comes from. That is the meaning.
Vîramitrodaya, pp. 434, 435.
