#### 26. The Ordeal of the Hot Piece of Gold.

343. <span id="fr_341"></span>[343](#fn_341) Now I shall give a
description of the ordeal of the hot piece of gold, which has been
ordained by Brahman himself for the purpose of distinguishing virtue
from vice.

\* 344. (The judge), after having cleansed himself, shall quickly pour
clarified butter into a golden, silver, iron, or earthen vessel, and
shall place the vessel on the fire.

\* 345. He shall throw into it a shining coin, made k of gold, silver,
copper, or iron, after having washed it in water more than once.

\* 346. <span id="fr_342"></span>[346](#fn_342) Should (the coin) ever
drop into the boiling (mixture), it would be a very dangerous thing to
touch him (the fire?). Therefore he must address the clarified butter
with the following prayer:

\* 347. ‘Thou art the best instrument of purification, O clarified
butter, and (comparable to) Ambrosia

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

at a sacrifice. Burn this man at once if he is criminal, and be as cold
as ice to him if he is innocent.’

\* 348. <span id="fr_343"></span>[348](#fn_343) If, on touching and
examining the forefinger (of the defendant) it is found to be unhurt and
to show no boils, he is innocent. Otherwise, he is not (innocent).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_341"></span>[119:343](sbe3333.htm#fr_341) 343-348. The
ordeal of the hot piece of gold (Taptamâsha) derives its name from the
gold coin (mâsha) or signet-ring (mudrikâ), which those who are tried by
this ordeal are required to pick out of a vessel filled with a boiling
liquid, with the thumb and forefinger. They are declared innocent, if
the hand remains unhurt.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[119:346](sbe3333.htm#fr_342) The reading of
the first half of this paragraph is quite uncertain, and the above
rendering conjectural.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[120:348](sbe3333.htm#fr_343) Some writers
refer to two further ordeals, besides the seven kinds mentioned by
Nârada. One of them is the ordeal of the red-hot ploughshare, which the
defendant is made to lick. The other consists of drawing lots.
