### II. THE PLAINT.

1\. The defects of a plaint have been declared as follows.. (It is
defective, if it) relates to the property of a stranger; if it is
without an object; if it does not state any quantity; if the mode of
acquisition is not referred to in it; if too little or too much is
written in it; and if it is unmeaning.

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

2. <span id="fr_723"></span>[2](#fn_722.md) That plaint is declared by the
wise to 'relate to the property of a stranger' in which joint property
is referred to in a claim raised by one man alone who has no right to
it, or without authorization from the other joint proprietors.

3. <span id="fr_724"></span>[3](#fn_723.md) A plaint is said to be 'without
an object' when a man, actuated by hatred or anger, taxes another with
the murder of a Brahman (or some other deadly sin) and revokes his own
charge afterwards on being required to prove it.

4\. That plaint 'does not state any quantity' in which no figure is
given with regard to a certain quantity, writing, measure, field, house,
or other (object).

5\. That plaint 'contains no reference to the mode of acquisition' which
does not say whether (the property in dispute) has been acquired by
learning, or gained as profit (or interest), or purchased, or obtained
by inheritance.

6\. 'Too little' is said to be written in that plaint in which the year,
month, fortnight, lunar day, and [day of](errata.htm#2.md) the week is not
referred to.

7. <span id="fr_725"></span>[7](#fn_724.md) 'Too much' may be said to be
written in that plaint in which (the plaintiff) after having caused the
plaint to be written goes on to mention the witnesses at once, without
waiting for the answer (of the defendant) to be delivered.

8. <span id="fr_726"></span>[8](#fn_725.md) That plaint is declared to be
'unmeaning'

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

which is rendered unclear by the mode of writing (exhibited in it),
though the claimant's previous statements be (duly) entered in it.

9. <span id="fr_727"></span>[9](#fn_726.md) Let him avoid, as a mere
semblance of a declaration, (a plaint the tenour of) which is unnatural,
not connected with an injury, senseless, purposeless, incapable of being
proved, or at variance (with possibility, or with justice).

10. <span id="fr_728"></span>[10](#fn_727.md) That suit which is prohibited
by the king, or opposed to the interests of the citizens, or of the
whole kingdom, or of the constituent elements of the state,

11\. As well as (those suits) which are opposed to the interests of a
town or village, or of eminent persons: all such suits are declared to
be inadmissible.

12. <span id="fr_729"></span>[12](#fn_728.md) A plaint in which several
different subjects are mixed up together can have no effect.

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

13. <span id="fr_730"></span>[13](#fn_729.md) That plaint is declared to be
inadmissible in which the order (of the words) is inverted, or the
arrangement confused, or scattered what belongs together, or which is
meaningless, or relative to bygone times, or unapproved.

14\. The order (of the words) is said to be inverted in that plaint the
meaning of which is rendered unclear by the omission (of certain words)
in their proper place, and which is not accepted (in consequence).

15\. When the original claim is forsaken and replaced by a different
proposition, the plaint is declared to be meaningless, and the previous
claim is not carried.

16\. When a claim is raised in regard to certain property long after the
expiration of the proper time, the plaint is said to relate to bygone
times, though evidence be forthcoming.

17. <span id="fr_731"></span>[17](#fn_730.md) That suit in which the claim
relates to one thing, and the judicial investigation to another, is
declared to be unapproved, because the trial is inconsistent.

18\. When the plaintiff in his written claim confounds

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

the charge with the evidence, such a claim also cannot take effect,
because the proper order of propositions is violated in it.

19\. That plaint should be utterly rejected in which two claims are
entered at once, one reasonable, and the other unreasonable.

20\. Should a man make mutually conflicting statements in a plaint, his
claim cannot succeed because of its being vitiated by inconsistent
assertions.

21. <span id="fr_732"></span>[21](#fn_731.md) When a man though capable (of
proving his claim) omits to prove it for twenty or ten years, after the
plaint has been lodged by him, his declaration becomes futile (in
consequence).

22. <span id="fr_733"></span>[22](#fn_732) (The plaintiff.md) may amend the
plaint while the answer has not been delivered. When the plaint has been
answered, the corrections must cease.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_722"></span>[236:2](sbe3352.htm#fr_723.md) That plaint is
meant in which a stranger or one not authorized by his partners claims
the property of a fellowship. Vîram.

<span id="fn_723"></span>[236:3](sbe3352.htm#fr_724.md) That plaint is said
to be without an object which is dropped afterwards by the claimant
himself. Vîram.

<span id="fn_724"></span>[236:7](sbe3352.htm#fr_725.md) 'Witnesses,' or
evidence generally. Vîram.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[236:8](sbe3352.htm#fr_726.md) There is another
reading, ubhaya*m* pûrva*m*, under which the <span id="page_327">p.
327</span> claimant is stated to have proffered both the accusation and
the answer. Vîram.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[237:9](sbe3352.htm#fr_727.md) Vy. *K*.; M. Macn.
I, 4, 10 (uncertain). 'Unnatural,' such as e.g. That person has taken my
rabbit's horn and refuses to restore it. 'Not connected with an injury,'
as, That man is doing his business in his own house by the light of a
lamp which is burning in mine. 'Senseless' (a number of syllables strung
together), without any intelligible meaning, as, e.g. ka*k*a*t*apam or
*g*a*d*adagavam. 'Purposeless,' as, This man, Dedavatta, is warbling a
melodious song before my house. 'Incapable of being proved,' as,
Devadatta mocks me by a frown. Such an assertion as this is incapable of
being proved, because it does not admit of proof. Owing to the transient
nature of the act, witnesses are not available, much less can
documentary evidence be resorted to; nor would it be proper to perform
an ordeal, on account of the trifling nature of the charge. 'At
variance' (with possibility), as, A dumb man has cursed me. Or, 'at
variance' with the interests of a town or kingdom. M.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[237:10](sbe3352.htm#fr_728.md) 10, 11. Vy. *K*.;
M. Macn. I, 4, 11 and May. p. 10 (uncertain).

<span id="fn_728"></span>[237:12](sbe3352.htm#fr_729.md) V. T.; M. Macn. I,
4, 12, &c. (uncertain). Each subject shall <span id="page_238">p.
238</span> be examined in its turn, not all subjects at the same time. A
plaint referring to many distinct articles or to several different
accusations is not faulty under this rule. M.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[238:13](sbe3352.htm#fr_730.md) 13-20. Vîram. pp.
67, 68.

13, 14. 'The order is inverted,' i.e. several syllables are inverted in
position in the written charge. Vîram, Sm*ri*ti*k*.

13\. 'The arrangement is confused,' when the natural order of the
sentence is interrupted and the sense vitiated in consequence. Vîram.,
Sm*ri*ti*k*.

13\. 'Scattered what belongs together,' i.e. the several parts of a
proposition are not put together. Ibid.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[238:17](sbe3352.htm#fr_731.md) 'Because the trial
is inconsistent,' because the different parts of the suit do not agree.
Sm*ri*ti*k*.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[239:21](sbe3352.htm#fr_732.md) Sm*ri*ti*k*.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[239:22](sbe3352.htm#fr_733.md) Vîram. p. 20.
