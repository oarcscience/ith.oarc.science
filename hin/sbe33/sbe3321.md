of the) witnesses.

\* 190. A child also cannot be (made a witness), nor a woman, nor one
man alone, nor a cheat, nor a relative, nor an enemy. These persons
might give false evidence.

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

\* 191. A child would speak falsely from ignorance, a woman from want of
veracity, an impostor from habitual depravity, a relative from
affection, an enemy from desire of revenge.

\* 192. <span id="fr_271"></span>[192](#fn_271.md) By consent of both
parties, one man alone even may become a witness in a suit. He must be
examined in public as a witness, though (he has been mentioned as) an
incompetent witness.

\* 193. <span id="fr_272"></span>[193](#fn_272.md) One who, weighed down by
the consciousness of his guilt looks as if he was ill, is constantly
shifting his position, and runs after everybody;

\* 194. Who walks irresolutely and without reason, and draws repeated
sighs; who scratches the ground with his feet, and who shakes his arm
and clothes;

\* 195. Whose countenance changes colour, whose forehead sweats, whose
lips become dry, and who looks above and about him;

\* 196. Who makes long speeches which are not to the purpose as if he
were in a hurry, and without being asked: such a person may be
recognised as a false witness, and the king should punish that sinful
man.

\* 197. <span id="fr_273"></span>[197](#fn_273.md) He who conceals his
knowledge (at the time

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

of trial), although he has previously related (what he knows) to others,
deserves specially heavy punishment, for he is more criminal than a
false witness even.
