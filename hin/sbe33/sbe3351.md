# QUOTATIONS FROM NÂRADA.

### I. JUDICIAL PROCEDURE.

1, 2. <span id="fr_710"></span>[1](#fn_709) He is called a (Prâ*d*vivâka
or) chief judge who—fully acquainted with the eighteen titles (of law)
and with the eight thousand subdivisions thereof, skilled in logic and
other branches of science, and thoroughly versed in revealed and
traditional lore—investigates the law relative to the case in hand by
putting questions (prâ*t*) and passing a decision (vive*k*ayati)
according to what was heard or understood by him.

3. <span id="fr_711"></span>[3](#fn_710) Let not a king actuated by
arrogance or avarice promote litigation among persons not engaged in a
controversy.

4. <span id="fr_712"></span>[4](#fn_711) The king shall examine judicial
quarrels between two litigant parties in a proper way, acting on
principles of equity and discarding both love and hatred.

5. <span id="fr_713"></span>[5](#fn_712) (In disputes) among merchants,
artizans, or the like persons, and in (disputes concerning) persons
subsisting by agriculture or as dyers, it is impossible for outsiders to
pass a sentence; and the passing of

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

the sentence must, therefore, be entrusted to persons acquainted with
such matters (in a cause of this sort).

6. <span id="fr_714"></span>[6](#fn_713) A lawsuit cannot be instituted
mutually between a teacher and his pupil, or between father and son, or
man and wife, or master and servant.

7. <span id="fr_715"></span>[7](#fn_714) A plaint is declared
(inadmissible) likewise by the learned in law, when it has been raised
by one against many, or by women, or by menials.

8. <span id="fr_716"></span>[8](#fn_715) He shall be admitted as
plaintiff whose grievance is the greater, or whose affair is the more
important of the two, and not he who was the first to go to law.

9. <span id="fr_717"></span>[9](#fn_716) Half of the (ordinary)
punishment is declared for him who either confesses his deed, after
having committed an illicit act of violence, or says of his own accord,
'It is true.'

10. <span id="fr_718"></span>[10](#fn_717) When (an assessor of the
court) has recognised the royal mind to swerve from the path of duty, he
must not pronounce an opinion which is agreeable to the king. (It is
only by declaring what is just that) he becomes free from sin.

11. <span id="fr_719"></span>[11](#fn_718) Transgression of (the king's)
commands, killing a female, mixture of castes, illicit intercourse with
another man's wife, robbery, pregnancy caused by another man than the
husband,

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

12\. Abuse, insulting language, assault, and procuring abortion, are the
ten (principal) crimes.

13. <span id="fr_720"></span>[13](#fn_719) He who arrests (his
adversary) by illegal means, such as by stopping his speech (through
gagging the mouth), or by preventing him from breathing, and the like
practices, is liable to punishment; but one who breaks (such arrest) is
not (punishable).

14. <span id="fr_721"></span>[14](#fn_720) When a lawsuit has been
judged without any previous examination of witnesses (or other
evidence), or when it has been decided in an improper manner, or when it
has been judged by unauthorized persons, the trial has to be renewed.

15. <span id="fr_722"></span>[15](#fn_721) Whatever property, whether
movable or immovable, has been kept (under the care of the judge, after
having become the subject of a dispute), must be handed over afterwards
to the victorious party together with the interest (accruing on it) and
with a document (attesting his victory).
