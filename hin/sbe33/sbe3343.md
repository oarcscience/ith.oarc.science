# ELEVENTH TITLE OF LAW.

##### BOUNDARY DISPUTES.

\* 1. <span id="fr_454"></span>[1](#fn_454.md) Whenever (a decision has to
be given) in regard to landed property, whether it be a dike (or
bridge), a field, a boundary, a tilled piece of ground, or a waste, it
is termed a Boundary Dispute.

2. <span id="fr_455"></span>[2](#fn_455.md) In all quarrels regarding
landed property or boundaries, the decision rests with the neighbours,
the inhabitants of the same town or village, the

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (other) members of
the same community, and the senior (inhabitants of the district),

\* 3. <span id="fr_456"></span>[3](#fn_456) (As also.md) with those living
outside on the outskirts of the village and who live by the tillage of
fields situated in those parts, and with herdsmen, bird-catchers,
hunters, and other inhabitants of the woods.

4. <span id="fr_457"></span>[4](#fn_457.md) These men shall determine the
boundary, in accordance with the (old) landmarks, (such as) chaff of
grain, coal, pot-sherds, wells, sanctuaries, trees,

5\. Objects of general notoriety, such as ant-hills, artificial mounds,
slopes, hills and the like, and fields, gardens, roads, and old dikes.

6\. When a piece of ground has been carried off by a stream, or
abandoned (by the owner), or when the boundary marks have been
destroyed, (they shall fix the boundary) according to the inference to
be drawn from (an inspection of) the spot, and according to the traces
of possession (held by the former owner).

\* 7. <span id="fr_458"></span>[7](#fn_458.md) Should the neighbours speak
falsely, when called upon to decide a question of this sort, they shall
all be punished one by one by the king, each having to pay the fine of
the (second or) middlemost degree.

\* 8. <span id="fr_459"></span>[8](#fn_459.md) The corporation, the senior
(inhabitants of

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

the district) and the rest shall also receive punishment one by one:
they shall have to pay the fine of the first degree, if they make false
statements.

\* 9. <span id="fr_460"></span>[9](#fn_460.md) The boundary should not be
fixed by one man single-handed, though he be a reliable person. This
business should be entrusted to a plurality of persons, because it is an
affair of importance.

\* 10. <span id="fr_461"></span>[10](#fn_461.md) Should a single man
undertake to fix the boundary, (he must do so) after having kept a fast,
in a collected frame of mind, wearing a garland of red flowers and a
(red) cloak, having strewed earth on his head.

\* 11. <span id="fr_462"></span>[11](#fn_462.md) Should there be no persons
conversant (with the true state of the question) and no boundary marks,
then the king himself shall fix the boundary between the two estates, as
he thinks best.

12\. According to this rule let all contests be decided in regard to
houses, gardens, reservoirs of water, sanctuaries and the rest, as well
as the space intermediate between two villages.

\* 13. When trees have grown on the boundary (or ridge) separating two
contiguous fields, the fruits and blossoms shall be assigned to the
owners of the two fields in common.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

\* 14. <span id="fr_463"></span>[14](#fn_463.md) When the boughs (or
offshoots) of trees grown on the field of one man should take root in
the field of another man, they must be known to belong by right to the
owner (of that field), because they have sprung forth in another field
(than the stem of the tree).

\* 15. <span id="fr_464"></span>[15](#fn_464.md) A cross-road, the
sanctuary of a deity, a street, and a public road must not be obstructed
by (a place for) ordure, a terrace, a pit, an aqueduct, the edge of a
thatch (syandanikâ), or the like (obstructions).

16\. Should any one cause such obstruction through inadvertency or by
force, the king shall impose on him a fine of the highest degree.

\* 17. <span id="fr_465"></span>[17](#fn_465) The (erection of a.md) dike
in the middle of another man's field is not a prohibited act, as it may
be productive of considerable advantage, whereas the loss is trifling.
That is to be desired as (comparative) gain where there is (a slight)
loss (only).

\* 18. <span id="fr_466"></span>[18](#fn_466.md) There are two sorts of
dikes (or watercourses), one (called kheya) which is dug into the
ground, and (another called bandhya) which prevents the access of water.
A kheya dike serves the purpose of irrigation, a bandhya dike serves to
keep the water off.

\* 19. No grain is (ever produced) without water;

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

but too much water tends to spoil the grain. An inundation is as
injurious (to growth) as a dearth of water.

\* 20. <span id="fr_467"></span>[20](#fn_467.md) If a man were to put in
repair a dike erected long ago, but decayed, without asking the
permission of the owner, he shall not have (the use and) profits of it.

\* 21. <span id="fr_468"></span>[21](#fn_468.md) However, after the death
of the owner or of another man sprung from the same race (who has
succeeded to his property), he may repair the dike, after having been
authorized to do so by the king.

\* 22. <span id="fr_469"></span>[22](#fn_469.md) By acting otherwise he
will get into trouble, in the same way as the hunter (of the tale). The
shafts of him are spent in vain who hits again and again one who has
been hit already.

23. <span id="fr_470"></span>[23](#fn_470.md) When the owner of a field is
unable (to cultivate it), or dead, or gone no one knows whither, any
stranger who undertakes its cultivation unchecked (by the owner or
others) shall be allowed to keep the produce.

\* 24. <span id="fr_471"></span>[24](#fn_471.md) When the owner returns
while the stranger

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

is engaged in cultivating the field, (the owner) shall recover his
field, after having paid (to the cultivator) the whole expense incurred
in tilling the waste.

25. <span id="fr_472"></span>[25](#fn_472.md) A deduction of an eighth part
(shall be made), till seven years have elapsed. But when the eighth year
arrives, (the owner) shall recover the field cultivated (by the other,
as his independent property).

\* 26. <span id="fr_473"></span>[26](#fn_473.md) A tract of land (which has
not been under cultivation) for a year is called Ardhakhila
(half-waste). That which has not been (under cultivation) for three
years is called Khila (waste). That which has not been under cultivation
for five years is no better than a forest.

27\. A field which has been held by three generations in succession, and
a house which has been inherited from an ancestor, cannot be estranged
(from its legitimate owner) by force of possession, except when the king
wills it so.

\* 28. <span id="fr_474"></span>[28](#fn_474.md) When grain has been
destroyed by cows or

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

other cattle crossing a fence, the herdsman deserves punishment in that
case, unless he should have done his best to keep the cattle off.

\* 29. <span id="fr_475"></span>[29](#fn_475.md) When grain has been
destroyed (altogether), with the root, the owner of it may claim a
corresponding quantity of grain (as damages); the herdsman shall be
corporally punished; and on his master he shall impose a fine.

\* 30. <span id="fr_476"></span>[30](#fn_476.md) A cow within ten days
after her calving, a full grown bull, a horse, and an elephant shall be
kept off carefully. The owner of any one out of these animals is not
liable to punishment (should they do mischief).

\* 31. <span id="fr_477"></span>[31](#fn_477) For (mischief done by.md) a
cow he shall inflict a fine of one Mâsha; for (mischief done by) a
female buffalo, two Mâshas; in the case of a goat or sheep (trespassing)
with its young, the fine shall amount to half a Mâsha.

32. <span id="fr_478"></span>[32](#fn_478) The (owners of.md) elephants and
horses shall not have to pay any fine; for they are looked upon as
protectors of (the king's) subjects. Impunity is (likewise) granted to
(the owner of) a strayed cow,

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

of one that has recently calved, and of one unmanageable.

33. <span id="fr_479"></span>[33](#fn_479) (As also to the owner of.md) one
that has lost her way, or broken down, or stuck (in marshy ground), or
(of) a bull marked with the sign of consecration. Four times (the amount
of the damage done) is declared (to be the fine) in the case of (a cow)
whose nostrils have been pierced and who abides in the field.

\* 34. <span id="fr_480"></span>[34](#fn_480.md) When the cattle lie down
in the field (after grazing), the fine to be inflicted shall be double;
when they remain (in the field for the night), it shall be four times
(the ordinary amount); when they graze in the sight (of the keeper),
that man shall be punished even as a thief.

35\. When cows, straying through the fault of

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

their keeper, have entered a field, no punishment shall be inflicted on
the owner of the cows; the herdsman (alone) is punishable (for the
damage done by them).

\* 36. <span id="fr_481"></span>[36](#fn_481) When (a herdsman.md) has been
seized by the king or (devoured) by an alligator, or struck by Indra's
thunderbolt, or bitten by a serpent, or fallen from a tree,

\* 37. <span id="fr_482"></span>[37](#fn_482.md) Or killed by a tiger or
other (ferocious animal), or smitten by a disease of any sort, no
offence can be imputed either to the herdsman or to the owner of the
cattle.

\* 38. <span id="fr_483"></span>[38](#fn_483.md) When a man claims damages
for grain consumed by cattle (grazing in his field), that quantity of
grain must be restored to him (by the owner of the cattle), which has
been consumed in the field in the estimation of the neighbours.

\* 39. <span id="fr_484"></span>[39](#fn_484.md) The cows shall be given up
to their owner, and the grain to the husbandman. In the same way a fine
shall be imposed on the herdsman when grain has been trodden down (by
cows).

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

40. <span id="fr_485"></span>[40](#fn_485.md) When a field is situate on
the borders of a village, or contiguous to a pasture ground, or adjacent
to a high road, the herdsman is not reprehensible for the destruction of
grain (in that field), if the field is not protected by a fence.

\* 41. <span id="fr_486"></span>[41](#fn_486) On (that side of.md) the
field which faces the road a fence shall be made over which a camel
cannot look, nor cattle or horses jump, and which a boar cannot break
through.

\* 42. <span id="fr_487"></span>[42](#fn_487.md) A householder's house and
his field are considered as the two fundaments of his existence.
Therefore let not the king upset either of them; for that is the root of
householders.

43\. When his people are flourishing, the religious merit and the
treasure of a king are sure to be in a flourishing state as well. When
(the people) cease to prosper, (his merit and his treasure) are sure to
abate as well. Therefore he must never lose sight of (that) cause of
prosperity.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_454"></span>[155:1](sbe3343.htm#fr_454.md) XI, 1. The meaning
is as follows: 'A dike,' an embankment for the purposes of irrigation.
'A field,' a cultivated piece of ground (under water). 'A boundary,' a
landmark. 'A tilled piece of ground,' cultivated soil. 'A waste,'
uncultivated ground. When a decision has to be given in a quarrel with
regard to any of these, it is called a lawsuit concerning landed
property, or Boundary Dispute. Vîramitrodaya, p. 451.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[155:2](sbe3343.htm#fr_455.md) Manu VIII, 259;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 150.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[156:3](sbe3343.htm#fr_456.md) The foresters shall
only be consulted in default of cultivators whose fields are adjacent to
the boundaries of the village. Vîramitrodaya, p. 456. Manu VIII, 260.
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 150.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[156:4](sbe3343.htm#fr_457.md) 4, 5. Manu VIII,
246-251; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 151.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[156:7](sbe3343.htm#fr_458.md) Manu VIII, 263;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 153. The fine of the second degree consists of 500
Pa*n*as.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[156:8](sbe3343.htm#fr_459.md) The lower degree of
punishment in the case of the persons here mentioned seems to be due to
the fact that they may be supposed to be interested in the suit.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[157:9](sbe3343.htm#fr_460.md) According to the
Vîramitrodaya (p. 458), this prohibition in regard to the determination
of the boundary by a single man, has reference to those only who are not
acceptable to both parties and unacquainted with the law.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[157:10](sbe3343.htm#fr_461.md) Manu VIII, 256;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 152.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[157:11](sbe3343.htm#fr_462.md) In default of
neighbours and other persons conversant with the state of the matter,
and of trees and other boundary marks, the king shall fix the boundary
of his own accord. He shall distribute the ground intermediate between
the two villages, which has become the subject of a contest, between the
two litigant parties, and fix landmarks between the two. Vîramitrodaya,
p. 460. Manu VIII, 265; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 153.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[158:14](sbe3343.htm#fr_463.md) This rule seems to
be intended principally for banyans and the like trees covering a large
area with their offshoots. The Nepalese MS. omits vv. 13, 14, 16.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[158:15](sbe3343.htm#fr_464.md) The term
syandanikâ is variously explained as denoting either the projecting roof
or the eaves of a house.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[158:17](sbe3343.htm#fr_465.md) Yâ*gñ*avalkya II,
156.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[158:18](sbe3343.htm#fr_466.md) Kheya means
literally 'what is capable of being dug,' and bandhya 'what is capable
of being stopped.' What is meant by these two terms may best be seen
from the next paragraph.

<span id="fn_467"></span>[159:20](sbe3343.htm#fr_467.md) With the owner's
permission, any man may restore a dike, &c., which has fallen into
decay. Vîramitrodaya, p. 468. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 157. Read prav*ri*ttam
in the text.

<span id="fn_468"></span>[159:21](sbe3343.htm#fr_468.md) The authority of
the king is required, because, without it, the profits of the dike would
have to be enjoyed by the king himself. *S*ee Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 157.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[159:22](sbe3343.htm#fr_469.md) The tertium
comparationis in this simile has to be sought in the vanity of the
effort only. Manu (IX, 73) applies the same simile to seed, i.e. semen
virile spent in vain on the field, i.e. wife of a stranger.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[159:23](sbe3343.htm#fr_470.md) 'Unable' (to
cultivate the field) through want of means. 'A field,' one which has
become a desert. Vivâda*k*intâma*n*i, p. 64.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[159:24](sbe3343.htm#fr_471.md) 'The owner,' or
his son or other (descendant). 'The whole expense incurred in tilling
the waste,' the cost of converting the desert into cultivated ground.
Vîramitrodaya, pp. 469, 470.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[160:25](sbe3343.htm#fr_472.md) It appears from an
analogous text of Kâtyâyana that this rule is intended for those cases
where the owner is unable to pay for the expense incurred by the
cultivator. Kâtyâyana says, 'If through want of means (the owner) do not
repay the expense entailed by the cultivation of the waste, the
cultivator shall be allowed to keep the produce minus an eighth part.
During eight years he may keep the (annual) produce (minus an eighth).
After that period, it shall belong, to the proprietor.'

<span id="fn_473"></span>[160:26](sbe3343.htm#fr_473.md) These definitions
are inserted here, because the previous rules according to the
commentators apply to a desert or forest only, the cultivation of which
causes considerable difficulty and expense.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[160:28](sbe3343.htm#fr_474.md) 28-42. Nârada's
eleventh title of law, though called 'Boundary Disputes,' is in reality
a collection of all legal rules relating to fields. Manu and those who
follow him treat the subject of damage done by cattle to crops or grass
as a section of the chapter on 'Disputes between master and herdsman,'
which title of law is wanting in the Nârada-sm*ri*ti.

28\. Gautama XII, 20.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[161:29](sbe3343.htm#fr_475.md) The author of the
Vîramitrodaya (p. 450) observes expressly that the term vadha denotes
corporal punishment, and not execution, in this place. The other
commentators agree with him. Manu VIII, 241; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 161;
Gautama XII, 26; Vish*n*u V, 146. The Nepalese MS. omits this paragraph.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[161:30](sbe3343.htm#fr_476.md) The reason why
horses and elephants have to be kept off is given in paragraph 32.
Horses and elephants were used for the purposes of war principally. Manu
VIII, 242; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 163, &c.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[161:31](sbe3343.htm#fr_477.md) Vish*n*u V,
140-144; Gautama XII, 22-25; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 159.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[161:32](sbe3343.htm#fr_478.md) 32, 33. Manu VIII,
242; Vish*n*u V, 150; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 163. The Nepalese MS. has 'a
pregnant cow' for 'a strayed cow.'

<span id="fn_479"></span>[162:33](sbe3343.htm#fr_479.md) The genuineness of
this paragraph appears doubtful, because some of the propositions
contained in it are nearly identical with the rules laid down in the
paragraphs immediately preceding and following it. Besides, the language
of this paragraph is obscure, and it is not given in any commentary nor
in the Nepalese MS. The solemn ceremony of setting a bull at liberty and
consecrating him to the gods, with a mark on each flank, is described by
Vish*n*u, chapter LXXXVI, and in the G*ri*hya-sûtras. Piercing the
nostrils of a barren cow is mentioned as an offence by Manu VIII, 325.
It does not become clear why damage done by a cow of this sort should be
a greater offence than damage done by an ordinary cow.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[162:34](sbe3343.htm#fr_480.md) 'When they lie
down in the field,' after having eaten their fill. 'When they remain,'
when they spend the night in the field, after grazing.
Vivâda*k*intâma*n*i, *G*agannâtha, &c. 'In the sight of the keeper:'
thus according to *G*agannâtha (Colebrooke's Digest, III, 4, 46). The
correctness of his interpretation is confirmed by Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 162.
According to the Vivâda*k*intâma*n*i (p. 67), the meaning is this, that
the cattle are allowed to graze by the keeper, in the sight of the
proprietor of the field, and in spite of the remonstrances of the
latter. Vish*n*u V, 145; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 160, 162.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[163:36](sbe3343.htm#fr_481.md) 'Seized by the
king,' employed in the king's business. See Colebrooke's Digest, III, 4,
52.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[163:37](sbe3343.htm#fr_482.md) This paragraph is
omitted in the Nepalese MS.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[163:38](sbe3343.htm#fr_483.md) Gautama XII, 26;
Manu VIII, 241; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 161. The Nepalese MS. inserts a
spurious verse here, the first half of which is identical with Manu IX,
37, and the second half identical with Nârada XI, 22.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[163:39](sbe3343.htm#fr_484.md) The meaning of the
injunction to give up the cows seems to be this, that the owner of the
cows shall not at once recover them, when they have been seized by the
proprietor of the field, after doing damage in the field. The
Vivâda*k*intâma*n*i has a different reading of this clause: gavatra*m*
gominâ deya*m*. This is explained as meaning that 'blades of corn must
be made good by the owner of cattle.' Similar readings are found in
other commentaries as well. Âpastamba II, II, 28, 5.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[164:40](sbe3343.htm#fr_485.md) 'Pasture ground,'
a meadow reserved for feeding cows or other cattle. Ratnâkara. See
Colebrooke's Digest, III, 4, 27. Manu VIII, 238, 240; Vish*n*u V, 547,
148; Gautama XII, 21; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 162.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[164:41](sbe3343.htm#fr_486.md) Manu VIII, 239.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[164:42](sbe3343.htm#fr_487.md) This maxim shows
that the compiler of the Nârada-sm*ri*ti wrote for an essentially
agricultural people.
