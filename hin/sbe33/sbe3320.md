#### 13. Six Cases where Witnesses are unnecessary.

\* 172. However, six different kinds of proceedings have been indicated
in which witnesses are not required. (Other) indications of the crime
committed are substituted for the evidence of witnesses in these cases
by the learned.

\* 173. It should be known that one carrying a firebrand in his hand is
an incendiary; that one taken with a weapon in his hand is a murderer;
and that, where a man and the wife of another man seize one another by
the hair, the man must be an adulterer.

\* 174. 74. One who goes about with a hatchet in his

hand and makes his approach may be recognised as a destroyer of bridges
(and embankments); one carrying an axe is declared a destroyer of trees.

\* 175. <span id="fr_259"></span>[175](#fn_259) One whose looks are
suspicious is likely to have committed an assault. In all these cases
witnesses may be dispensed with; only in the (last-mentioned) case of
assault careful investigation is required.

176\. Some one might make marks upon his person through hatred, to
injure an enemy. In such cases it is necessary to resort to inductive
reasoning, (ascertaining) the fact of the matter, and strata gems, in
order to get a (reliable) test.

looks,' as e.g. a sword smeared with blood. Vîramitrodaya. In an
analogous text of *S*aṅkha, as quoted in the Vîramitrodaya, &c., the
possession of stolen goods is mentioned as a further manifest proof of
crime.
