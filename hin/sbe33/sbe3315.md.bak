#### 8. Sureties.

\* 117. <span id="fr_212"></span>[117](#fn_212.md) The guarantee to be
offered to a creditor may be twofold: a surety and a pledge. A document
and (the deposition of) witnesses are the two modes of proof on which
evidence is founded.

\* 118. <span id="fr_213"></span>[118](#fn_213.md) For appearance, for
payment, and for honesty, these are the three different purposes for
which the three sorts of sureties have been mentioned by the sages.

\* 119. <span id="fr_214"></span>[119](#fn_214.md) If the debtors fail to
discharge the debt, or

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

if they prove dishonest, the surety (for payment and for honesty) must
pay the debt; and (so must the surety for appearance), if he fails to
produce the debtor.

120. <span id="fr_215"></span>[120](#fn_215.md) When there is a plurality
of sureties, they shall pay each (proportionately), according to
agreement. If they were bound severally, the payment shall be made (by
any of them), as the creditor pleases.

\* 121. <span id="fr_216"></span>[121](#fn_216.md) Twice as much as the
surety, harassed by the creditor, has given (to the creditor), shall the
debtor pay back to the surety.

122. <span id="fr_217"></span>[122](#fn_217.md) By the mode consonant with
religion, by legal

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

proceedings, by fraud, by the customary mode, and, fifthly, by force, a
creditor may recover what he has lent.

\* 123. <span id="fr_218"></span>[123](#fn_218.md) A creditor who tries to
recover his loan from the debtor must not be checked by the king, both
for secular and religious reasons.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_212"></span>[70:117](sbe3315.htm#fr_212.md) A surety and a
pledge are the two sorts of guarantee for a loan on interest. Documents
and witnesses are the two kinds of evidence for each of the four
elements, which have to be distinguished in the law of debt, viz. the
principal, the interest, the surety, and the pledge. A.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[70:118](sbe3315.htm#fr_213.md) A surety for
appearance is where the debtor denies the debt, and is asked to prove
his denial in a court. In that case, he must produce a man, who becomes
surety for the debtor's appearance at the time of the trial. A surety
for payment is where the creditor, anxious to obtain a loan, produces
one or several sureties, who are either jointly or severally bound. A
surety for honesty is where the debtor denies having received a certain
sum, or declares that he has restored it to the creditor, and is
required thereupon to produce a surety for his veracity. A.
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 53; Vish*n*u VI, 41.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[70:119](sbe3315.htm#fr_214.md) This paragraph is
intended to show that the surety for appearance and the surety for
honesty are equally responsible as the <span id="page_71">p. 71</span>
surety for payment. A. Manu VIII, 158-160; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 53;
Vish*n*u VI, 41.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[71:120](sbe3315.htm#fr_215.md) Where a number of
sureties have promised each to pay a certain stipulated share of the
debt, in case of the debtor's inability to discharge it himself, the
liability of each surety does not extend beyond what has been promised
by him. Where, however, all the sureties have declared their joint
liability for the whole debt, the creditor may enforce payment from any
one among them whom he thinks able to satisfy his demand. A.
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 55; Vish*n*u VI, 42.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[71:121](sbe3315.htm#fr_216.md) When, however, the
surety, anxious to obtain twice the amount of the sum for which he has
given security, should pay the sum to the creditor of his own accord,
without being pressed to do so by the creditor, the debtor shall pay
that sum only to him, and not the double sum. A. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 56;
Vish*n*u VI, 43.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[71:122](sbe3315.htm#fr_217.md) Identical with
Manu VIII, 49. According to Asahâya, four out of the five modes of
recovery of a debt are equivalent to the traditional four means of
obtaining success, viz. conciliation, division (bheda), presents, and
violence. Thus, 'the mode consonant with religion' means conciliation,
i.e. gentle remonstrances. If these should prove of no avail, 'legal
proceedings,' or 'division' (bheda), shall be resorted to, i.e. the
debtor shall be threatened with a plaint in a court of justice. After
that, 'presents' or 'fraud' should be adhibited, i.e. a false hope of
fictitious gain shall be held out to the debtor. If this mode also
should prove unsuccessful, 'force' or 'violence' <span id="page_72">p.
72</span> may be used, by fettering the debtor, or confining him, &c.
The fifth mode, called the customary mode (â*k*arita), consists of
fasting. If the creditor himself, or his son, or his servant, takes to
fasting it is no offence; or he may confine his own son or threaten to
kill him, or seize the property of a stranger, as a compensation. The
commentators of the Code of Manu explain the five modes of recovery of a
debt much in the same way as Asahâya. 'Fraud,' according to them, is
when the creditor borrows money from the debtor under false pretences,
or retains a deposit belonging to him. Vyavahâra, generally interpreted
by 'legal proceedings,' means, according to Medhâtithi, engaging the
debtor in agriculture, trade, or other work, and 'taking the proceeds of
his labour.' The 'customary mode' (â*k*arita) is variously explained as
denoting 'fasting,' or 'killing' or 'taking (one's own or the debtor's)
family and cattle.' Under the former interpretation, it is identical
with the well-known 'sitting in Dharna.' See the translations of Manu,
and Jolly, Ind. Schuldrecht, § 7. For an interesting parallel to the
custom of Dharna from the Brehon Laws of Ancient Ireland, see Sir H.
Maine's Early History of Institutions, p. 297 foll.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[72:123](sbe3315.htm#fr_218.md) A dishonest debtor
who applies to the king for protection against a creditor enforcing his
demand shall not be abetted by the king. 'For secular reasons,' i.e. in
order not to disturb the established order of society. 'For religious
reasons,' i.e. in order not to offend against religious law. A. Nearly
identical with Manu VIII, 50. Vish*n*u VI, 19; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 40.
