#### 20. The Ordeal by Balance.

\* 260. <span id="fr_303"></span>[260](#fn_303.md) Wise legislators
conversant with every law have proclaimed, after mature consideration,
the following rules regarding the mode of performing the ordeal by
balance, which may be administered in every season.

\* 261. <span id="fr_304"></span>[261](#fn_304.md) The two posts should be
dug in every

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

case to the depth of two Hastas below ground. (The whole of) their
length is ordained to amount to six Hastas in extent.

\* 262. The beam of the balance should be four Hastas in length, and the
height of the two posts (above ground) should be the same. The
intermediate space between the two posts should measure one and a half
Hastas.

\* 263. <span id="fr_305"></span>[263](#fn_305.md) The beam of the balance
should be made straight, of Khadira or of Tinduka wood, quadrangular and
(provided) with three Sthânas and with hooks (by which the strings
supporting the scale are suspended) and with other (contrivances).

\* 264. <span id="fr_306"></span>[264](#fn_306.md) He should cause it to be
made of Khadira wood or *S*i*m*sapa wood, or in default of such, of

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *S*âla wood,
(which must be) without notches and withered portions, and devoid of
rents.

\* 265. <span id="fr_307"></span>[265](#fn_307.md) These kinds of timber
should be used for preparing the beam of the balance, (which should be
erected) either in the midst of a public assembly, or before the gates
of the royal palace, or in sight of a temple, or in a cross-road.

266. <span id="fr_308"></span>[266](#fn_308) (The balance.md) must be dug
firmly into the earth, after having been covered with perfumes,
garlands, and unguents, and after the performance of purificatory and
auspicious ceremonies with sour milk, whole grain, clarified butter, and
perfumes.

267. <span id="fr_309"></span>[267](#fn_309.md) This ordeal should always
be administered in the presence of the guardians of the world, who must
be invoked to be present for the protection (of virtue and justice), and
in sight of everybody (who cares to look on).

\* 268. <span id="fr_310"></span>[268](#fn_310.md) It is ordained that all
ordeals should be

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

administered in the forenoon, the person (to be tested) having fasted
for a day and a night, taken a bath, and wearing his wet dress.

269\. Excepting cases of high treason, an ordeal shall not be
administered, unless the plaintiff comes forward and declares himself
ready to undergo punishment in case of his being defeated.

270\. The king may inflict ordeals on his own servants, even without the
one party declaring himself ready to undergo punishment. On the other
hand, in the case of other persons accused of a crime, (he should
administer ordeals) according to law (only).

\* 271. <span id="fr_311"></span>[271](#fn_311.md) After having well
fastened the two scales by the hooks of the beam, he should place the
man in the one scale and a stone in the other.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

\* 272. He should weigh the man on the northern side, and the stone on
the southern side. There (in the southern scale) he should (place) a
basket and fill it up with bricks, mud, and grains of sand.

273. <span id="fr_312"></span>[273](#fn_312.md) In the first weighing, the
weight (of the man) should be ascertained with the aid of experienced
men, and the arch marked at that height which corresponds to the even
position of the two scales.

\* 274. Goldsmiths, merchants, and skilful braziers experienced in the
art of weighing, should inspect the beam of the balance.

\* 275. After having first weighed the man, and having made (on the
arches) a mark for the beam, in order to show the (even) position of the
scales, he should cause him to descend from the balance.

\* 276. <span id="fr_313"></span>[276](#fn_313.md) After having admonished
him with solemn imprecations he should cause the man to get into the
scale again, after having fastened a writing on

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

his head. There must be neither wind nor rainfall (at the time when this
ordeal is being performed).

277. <span id="fr_314"></span>[277](#fn_314.md) When he has ascended (the
scale), a Brahman, holding the scale in his hand, should recite the
following: 'Thou art called dha*t*a (a balance), which appellation is
synonymous with dharma (justice).

\* 278. Thou knowest the bad and good actions of all beings. This man,
being arraigned in a cause, is weighed upon thee.

279. <span id="fr_315"></span>[279](#fn_315.md) Thou art superior to gods,
demons, and mortals in point of veracity.

\[Thou, Balance, hast been created by the gods in time out of mind, as a
receptacle of truth.

\* 280. Deign to speak truth, therefore, O propitious being, and deliver
me from this perplexity. If I am an offender, take me down.

\* 281. If thou knowest me to be innocent, take me upwards.\] Therefore
mayst thou deliver him lawfully from the perplexity in which he is
involved.'

282\. After having addressed him, (invoking) the guardians of the world
and the gods, with these and other such speeches, he should cause the
man who has been placed in the scale, to descend once more and should
ascertain (the state of the matter).

\* 283. If he rises, on being weighed (for the second time), he is
undoubtedly innocent. If his

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

weight remains the same as before, or if he goes down, he cannot be
acquitted.

\* 284. <span id="fr_316"></span>[284](#fn_316.md) Should the scales break,
or the beam or the hooks split, or the strings burst, or the transverse
beam split, (the judge) shall pronounce a formal declaration of his
innocence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_303"></span>[102:260](sbe3327.htm#fr_303.md) 260-284. Vish*n*u
X; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 100-102.

260\. 'After mature consideration,' after having duly considered that
the ordeals by fire, water, and poison are subject to many interruptions
or obstacles arising from time, locality, &c., wise men have devised
this ordeal by balance, which may be performed during any season. That
is the meaning. A.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[102:261](sbe3327.htm#fr_304.md) The apparatus for
performing the ordeal by balance, which is described in this and the
following paragraphs, consists of the <span id="page_103">p. 103</span>
following elements: 1. Two wooden posts, supporting a transverse beam.
The two posts should be fastened in the ground at a distance of
one-and-a-half Hastas (1 Hasta = about 18 inches), facing the west and
east. The part above ground should be four Hastas long, and the part
below ground two Hastas, the whole length of each post amounting to six
Hastas. 2. The beam of the balance, by which the scales have to be
suspended. The beam itself, which should measure four Hastas, and should
be made of Khadira or other strong wood, should be suspended by means of
an iron hook and chain in the middle of the transverse beam. 3. The beam
of the balance should be surrounded in the middle and at the two
extremities, by three Sthânas (belts?) by which two iron hooks should be
fastened. 4. The two scales should be suspended at the two ends of the
beam, by the iron hooks, and by four strings each. 5. Each of the two
scales should move in a wooden arch (tora*n*a), which serves the purpose
of marking the position of the scales. See Mitâksharâ and Stenzler's
paper on Ordeals (vol. ix of the Journal of the German Oriental
Society), to which a drawing has been added for the purpose of
illustrating the statements of the Sm*ri*ti writers regarding this kind
of ordeal.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[103:263](sbe3327.htm#fr_305.md) Read *rig*vî in
the text.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[103:264](sbe3327.htm#fr_306.md) Wood of the
Khadira tree is the most eligible sort of wood. Then comes Tinduka wood,
and lastly *S*i*m*sapa wood. A.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[104:265](sbe3327.htm#fr_307.md) The various
places here mentioned are the favourite abodes of Dharmarâ*g*a (the king
of justice), when he appears on earth. A. The Vîramitrodaya and other
compositions quote two verses of Kâtyâyana, to the effect that ordeals
should be administered to felons in sight of a temple; to those who have
offended against the king, before the gates of his palace; to low-caste
persons, in a cross-road; and to other offenders, in the midst of a
public assembly, or court of justice.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[104:266](sbe3327.htm#fr_308.md) It appears from
the statements of other legislators, that the ceremonies to be performed
on this occasion are perfectly analogous to those which have to take
place on the occasion of preparing a sacrificial stake (yûpa).

<span id="fn_309"></span>[104:267](sbe3327.htm#fr_309.md) 'In sight of
everybody,' not in a solitary spot. A.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[104:268](sbe3327.htm#fr_310.md) 268-270. This is
a digression relative to certain exceptions to the rule in pars. 257,
258. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 96, 99; Vish*n*u IX, 22.

268\. An ordeal is ordained, when the plaintiff declares himself ready
to undergo punishment. Where, however, any outrage has been committed
against the royal family, an ordeal should be administered even without
a declaration of this sort. A.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[105:271](sbe3327.htm#fr_311.md) The essential
features of the proceedings described in pars. 271-284 may be summarized
as follows: 1. The person to be tested by this ordeal should be placed
in the one scale, and a basket filled with stones and sand placed in the
other scale, as an equivalent. 2. The basket having been made precisely
equal in weight to the man with the help of goldsmiths and other persons
skilled in the practice of weighing, the position of the beam should be
marked on each of the two arches. 3. After that, the man should be
allowed to descend from the scale. The judge should admonish him, and he
should get into the scale again, after a bill recounting the charge
raised against him has been fastened on his head. 4. A Brahman should
address the balance with prayers. 5. The man having descended once more
from the scale, the result of the second weighing should be compared
with the result of the first weighing. If he has risen, i.e. if he has
proved lighter than the first time, he shall be acquitted; if the scale
has gone down, or if it has remained in the same place as before, he
must be pronounced guilty. 6. If any part of the balance has broken
during the proceeding, he has to be acquitted.

271\. The term 'a stone' seems to denote an equivalent here and in the
next paragraph. The sequel shows that the equivalent consists of a
basket filled with stones and other objects.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[106:273](sbe3327.htm#fr_312.md) 273-275.
Goldsmiths, merchants, braziers, and other persons familiar with the art
of weighing, should ascertain whether the man and the equivalent are
precisely equal in weight, and whether the beam of the balance is quite
straight, by pouring some water (on the beam of the balance?). A.
According to the Pitâmaha-sm*ri*ti, the water shall be poured on the
beam of the balance. If it does not trickle down from the beam, the beam
may be supposed to be straight. The way in which the position of the
scales and of the beam of the balance has to be marked on the two
arches, may be gathered from the Yâ*gñ*avalkya-sm*ri*ti, which ordains
that a line shall be drawn (across the arches).

<span id="fn_313"></span>[106:276](sbe3327.htm#fr_313.md) He should cause
the man to get into the scale once more, after having reminded him of
his good actions and of the preeminence of truth, having invoked the
deities, and having fastened on his head a bill recounting the charge,
and containing an imprecation. The whole proceeding must not take place
in windy or rainy weather. A. The Vîramitrodaya and other compilations
quote another text of Nârada, according to which no verdict should be
given if the scales have been moved by the wind.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[107:277](sbe3327.htm#fr_314.md) This quibble is
based on the fact that the two words Dha*t*a and Dharma commence with
the same syllable.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[107:279](sbe3327.htm#fr_315.md) 279-281. The
words enclosed in brackets cannot be genuine. They appear to be a
quotation from the Yâ*gñ*avalkya-sm*ri*ti (II, 101, 102), which has been
added as a marginal gloss by a copyist, and has subsequently crept into
the text. Yâ*gñ*avalkya puts this entire address in the mouth of the
defendant himself, whereas all the other *S*m*ri*ti writers put it in
the mouth of a third person.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[108:284](sbe3327.htm#fr_316.md) It seems strange
that the accidents mentioned in this paragraph should be viewed as
proofs of innocence. Vish*n*u, Kâtyâyana, and Vyâsa rule that the
proceeding shall be repeated in every such case. B*ri*haspati says that
these accidents shall be taken as proofs of guilt. The reading
mûrtita*h* may be wrong (for puna*h* sa? 'he shall cause the proceeding
to be repeated'). See Vyâsa.
