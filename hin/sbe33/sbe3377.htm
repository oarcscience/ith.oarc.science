<p>1.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1140"></A><A HREF="#fn_1139"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> This rule regarding rescission of purchase and sale has been declared. Hear the laws concerning boundaries of villages, fields, houses, and so forth.</p>  
<p>2.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1141"></A><A HREF="#fn_1140"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The determination of boundaries should be settled at the time of foundation, and it should be marked by visible and invisible signs, so as to dispel doubt.</p>  
<p>3.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1142"></A><A HREF="#fn_1141"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Wells, tanks, pools, large trees, gardens, temples, mounds, channels, the course of a river, reeds, shrubs, or piles of stones:</p>  
<p>4. By such visible signs as these a boundary line should always be caused to be marked; also, by other (marks) deposited underground which the earth is not likely to destroy.</p>  
<p>5.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1143"></A><A HREF="#fn_1142"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Dry cowdung, bones, chaff, charcoal, stones, potsherds, sand, bricks, cows&#146; tails, cotton seeds, and ashes:</p>  
<p>6. After having placed these substances in vessels, one should deposit them underground at the extremities of the boundary. After that, one should take care to point them out to youths and infants.</p>  
<p>7.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1144"></A><A HREF="#fn_1143"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> These (youths and infants) should again show them to their own children, after having grown old;</p>

<p><A NAME="page_352"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 352</FONT></A></p>  
<p>by knowledge thus passing from one generation to the other, doubts regarding boundaries may be obviated.</p>  
<p>8.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1145"></A><A HREF="#fn_1144"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> In disputes regarding a house or field, the decision belongs to the neighbours, as well as to the inhabitants of that town or village, or to members of the same society, and to the elders (of that district).</p>  
<p>9. (Likewise, to) husbandmen, artizans, servants, cowherds, hunters, gleaners, diggers of roots, fishermen, kinsmen, mischief-makers, and robbers.</p>  
<p>10.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1146"></A><A HREF="#fn_1145"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> After having been adjured by imprecations befitting their station, they shall determine the boundary, and shall indicate the marks deposited underground, as evidence. Such is the law.</p>  
<p>11.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1147"></A><A HREF="#fn_1146"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> In default of witnesses and signs, even a single man, agreeable to both parties, may fix the boundary, wearing a red garland of flowers and a red cloak, putting earth on his head, adhering to truth, and having kept a fast.</p>  
<p>12.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1148"></A><A HREF="#fn_1147"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> Neighbours born in that district, though they be living abroad, are termed natives of the place; they should be consulted in the decision of a suit.</p>  
<p>13. What they should declare in a doubtful case, as honest men and impartial to both parties, shall be held decisive; thus justice will not be violated.</p>  
<p>14.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1149"></A><A HREF="#fn_1148"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> Those are witnesses in a suit of this kind who know the title of acquisition, the size, the duration of the enjoyment, the name, and the characteristics of the land in question.</p>

<p>15.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1150"></A><A HREF="#fn_1149"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>The same rule holds good in all suits concerning immovable property. If their statements do not agree, they shall be made to pay the highest fine.</p>  
<p>16.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1151"></A><A HREF="#fn_1150"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> Supposing a piece of land to have been taken from a village belonging to one man, and given to another man, either by a large river or by the king, what should be decided in that case?</p>  
<p>17. The land abandoned by a river or granted by the king belongs to him who receives it. Otherwise, there would be no acquisition through fate or the king among men.</p>  
<p>18. Loss and gain and life among men depend on the act of fate and of the king; therefore, in all affairs, what is effected by them must not be rescinded.</p>  
<p>19. When a river has been fixed as the boundary line between two villages, it shall never be removed, on account of loss or gain arising (from that river to either village). He who removes it, is liable to punishment.</p>  
<p>20. The encroachment (of a river) on one side produces an increase of land elsewhere in banks of rivers; that (increase) must not be taken from him (who gets it).</p>

<p>of a river overflowing a tilled piece of ground, the previous owner shall recover it.</p>  
<p>22. When land is taken from one man by a king actuated by anger or avarice, or using a fraudulent pretext, and bestowed on a different person as a mark of his favour, such a gift is not considered as valid.</p>  
<p>23.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1153"></A><A HREF="#fn_1152"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> When (however) land is taken from a person enjoying it without a legitimate title of ownership, and given to a worthier person, (the latter) must not be deprived of it.</p>  
<p>24.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1154"></A><A HREF="#fn_1153"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A> A house, pool, shop or the like having been used by a man since the time of its foundation, must not be taken from him, nor diminished or altered.</p>  
<p>25.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1155"></A><A HREF="#fn_1154"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A> A window, a watercourse, a peg projecting from a wall (used to hang things upon), a shed (erected in a courtyard), a square of four buildings, and a channel for the exit of water (after a rainfall), must not be blocked up, when previously constructed.</p>  
<p>26.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1156"></A><A HREF="#fn_1155"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A> A privy, a fireplace, a pit, or a receptacle for leavings of food and other (rubbish), must never be made very close to the house of another man.</p>  
<p>27.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1157"></A><A HREF="#fn_1156"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A> A passage by which men and animals go to and fro incremented is called Sa<I>m</I>sara<I>n</I>a, and must not be obstructed by any one.</p>  
<p>28.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1158"></A><A HREF="#fn_1157"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A> He who purposely crowds such a place (by carts and the like), or makes a pit, or plants trees, or voids excrements, shall pay a M&acirc;shaka as a fine.</p>
