### XXIII. ADULTERY.

1. <span id="fr_1200"></span>[1](#fn_1199) The two kinds of injury
(abuse and assault) and the three kinds of violence have been declared.
Learn the threefold (offence of) adultery, which is productive of sin.

2\. The two first kinds of it are connected with violence and deception
respectively, the third kind springs from sensual desire; the last is
again of three sorts, being of the first, second, or highest degree.

3\. When a man has intercourse with a woman in secret against her will,
when she is asleep, or disordered in her intellect, or does not notice
his approach, it is (termed) forcible enjoyment of a woman.

4\. When he conducts her into his house under false pretences, and after
giving her intoxicating drugs, has intercourse with her, it is
considered fraudulent enjoyment of a woman.

5\. When a man exchanges looks with a woman or sends her messages, and
has intercourse with her impelled by sensuality, it has to be considered
as (adulterous intercourse) springing from sensual desire.

6. <span id="fr_1201"></span>[6](#fn_1200) Winking (at a woman), smiling
(at her), sending her messengers, and touching her ornaments or clothes,
is termed an adulterous act of the first (or lowest) degree.

7\. Sending perfumes, garlands, fruit, spirituous liquor, food, or
clothes, and conversing with her in

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

secret, is considered an adulterous act of the second degree.

8\. Sitting on the same bed, dallying, and kissing or embracing each
other, is defined as an adulterous act of the highest degree by persons
acquainted with law.

9. <span id="fr_1202"></span>[9](#fn_1201) For these three gradations of
adultery, the first, middling, and highest fines shall be inflicted
respectively; the fine shall be even higher than that, in the case of a
very rich man.

10. <span id="fr_1203"></span>[10](#fn_1202) (The king) shall confiscate
the whole wealth of him who violates an unwilling woman, and having
caused his penis and scrotum to be cut off, shall cause him to be
paraded on an ass.

11. <span id="fr_1204"></span>[11](#fn_1203) When a man enjoys a woman
by fraud, his punishment shall be confiscation of his entire wealth, and
he shall afterwards be branded with the mark of a female part and
banished from the town.

12\. The highest fine (shall be inflicted for connexion) with a woman of
equal caste; half of that (for connexion) with a woman of inferior
caste; but a man who has connexion with a woman of higher caste than his
own, shall be put to death.

13. <span id="fr_1205"></span>[13](#fn_1204) When a woman has been
enjoyed against her

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

will, she shall be kept in the house well guarded, smeared (with ashes),
lying on a low couch, and receiving a bare maintenance only.

14\. To atone for her sin, she shall be caused to perform the K*rikkh*ra
or Parâka penance, in case she had intercourse with her equal in caste;
but if she has been enjoyed by a man of inferior caste, she shall be
abandoned and put to death.

15. <span id="fr_1206"></span>[15](#fn_1205) When a woman comes to a
man's house and excites his concupiscence by touching him or the like
acts, she shall be punished; half of her punishment shall be inflicted
on the man.

16. <span id="fr_1207"></span>[16](#fn_1206) Her nose, lips, and ears
having been cut off, she shall be paraded in the streets and plunged
into water; or she shall be torn to pieces by dogs in a public place
frequented by many persons.
