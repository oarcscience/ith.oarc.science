#### 6. Lending Money at Interest.

\* 98. <span id="fr_194"></span>[98](#fn_194.md) A contract of delivery and
receipt may be made with a view to the profit arising from Sthâna. It is
called Kusîda (lending money at interest), and money-lenders make a
living by it.

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

\* 99. <span id="fr_195"></span>[99](#fn_195.md) Let a money-lender take,
in addition to the principal, the interest fixed by Vasish*th*a, viz. an
eightieth part of a hundred in every month.

\* 100. <span id="fr_196"></span>[100](#fn_196.md) Two, three, four, or
five (in the hundred) is the legitimate (rate of interest). Let him take
as much in the shape of interest, every month, in the direct order of
the (four) castes.

\* 101. <span id="fr_197"></span>[101](#fn_197.md) Or let him take two in
the hundred, remembering the practice of the virtuous. By taking two in
the hundred, he does not commit the crime of covetousness.

\* 102. <span id="fr_198"></span>[102](#fn_198.md) Interest is declared
fourfold in this law-book: periodical interest; stipulated interest;
kâyikâ interest; and compound interest.

\* 103. <span id="fr_199"></span>[103](#fn_199.md) That which runs by the
month is termed

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

periodical interest. That interest is termed stipulated interest which
has been promised by the debtor himself.

\* 104. Interest at the rate of one Pa*n*a or quarter of a Pa*n*a, paid
regularly without diminishing the principal, is denoted kâyikâ interest.
Interest upon interest is called compound interest.

\* 105. <span id="fr_200"></span>[105](#fn_200.md) This is the general rule
for interest to be paid on loans. There are special rules according to
the local usages of the country where the loan has been made.

\* 106. <span id="fr_201"></span>[106](#fn_201.md) In some countries the
loan may grow till twice the amount of the principal has been reached.
In other countries it may grow till it becomes three, or four, or eight
times as large as the principal.

107. <span id="fr_202"></span>[107](#fn_202.md) The interest on gold,
grain, and clothes may rise till it amounts to two, three, or four times
the principal. On liquids, the interest may become octuple; of women and
cattle, their offspring (is considered as the interest).

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

\* 108. <span id="fr_203"></span>[108](sbe3314.htm#fn_203.md) No interest
must ever be raised on loans made from friendship, unless there be an
agreement to the purpose. Without an agreement even, interest accrues on
such loans after the lapse of half a year.

\* 109. <span id="fr_204"></span>[109](sbe3314.htm#fn_204.md) A loan made
from friendship can never yield any interest, without being reclaimed by
the creditor. If the debtor refuses to restore it on demand, it shall
yield interest at the rate of five per cent.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_194"></span>[65:98](sbe3313.htm#fr_194.md) According to A.,
Sthâna, 'continued abode,' may be threefold: relating to the matter, as
when profit arises from (the continuance of) victuals remaining well
kept in a certain place; or relating to one's own abode, as when a
dealer derives profit from business transactions in his own country; or
relating to a different place, as when a dealer earns money through
foreign trade.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[66:99](sbe3313.htm#fr_195.md) Identical with Manu
VIII, 140. This rule, which fixes the rate of interest at 1¼ per cent.
by the month, or 15 per cent. per annum, is actually found in the
Dharmasûtra of Vasish*th*a II, 51.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[66:100](sbe3313.htm#fr_196.md) Identical with
Manu VIII, 142. The meaning is that he shall take 2 per cent. from a
Brahman, 3 per cent. from a Kshatriya, 4 per cent. from a Vai*s*ya, and
5 per cent. from a *S*ûdra. A. It appears, from the commentaries on the
code of Manu, that the present rule is applicable in those cases where
no security has been given, whereas the preceding paragraph refers to
loans secured by a pledge.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[66:101](sbe3313.htm#fr_197.md) Identical with
Manu VIII, 141. The meaning is that he shall take 2 per cent. only from
honest men, to whatever caste they may belong. A. In the code of Manu,
the present rule precedes par. 100, instead of following it. The author
of the Nârada-sm*ri*ti would seem to have erroneously inverted the
original position of the two verses.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[66:102](sbe3313.htm#fr_198.md) Manu VIII, 153;
Gautama XII, 34, 35. See, too, Colebrooke's Digest I, XXXV-XLV.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[66:103](sbe3313.htm#fr_199.md) 103, 104.
'Periodical interest' means monthly interest, at the rate of from 2 to 5
per cent., according to the caste of the debtor. 'Stipulated interest'
is interest at the rate of more than 10 per cent., which has been
promised by the debtor himself in times of great distress. Kâya means
principal. If a Pa*n*a, or quarter of a Pa*n*a, has to be <span
id="page_67">p. 67</span> paid every day, without diminishing the
principal, i.e. if the whole principal has to be restored, though ever
so much interest may have been paid on it, it is called kâyikâ interest.
Where interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per mensem has been paid for
twenty months, it will reach the same amount as the sum originally due,
so that the principal is doubled. After twenty months more it becomes
quadruple; twenty months later it becomes octuple, and so on. This is
called compound interest. A. B*ri*haspati and Vyâsa derive the term
kâyikâ from kâya 'a body,' and explain that it denotes bodily labour, or
the use of a pledged slave.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[67:105](sbe3313.htm#fr_200.md) Where local
customs obtain, differing from the rules previously given, they have to
be followed. A.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[67:106](sbe3313.htm#fr_201.md) 106, 107. Manu
VIII, 151; Vish*n*u VI, 11-17; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 39; Gautama XII, 36.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[67:107](sbe3313.htm#fr_202.md) Gold borrowed at
whatsoever rate of interest shall grow till it becomes double; grain,
till it becomes treble; cloth, till it becomes <span id="page_68">p.
68</span> quadruple; liquids (and condiments), till they become octuple.
The offspring of pledged females and cattle shall belong to the
creditor. A.
