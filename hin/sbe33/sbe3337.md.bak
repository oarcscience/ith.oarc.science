# FIFTH TITLE OF LAW.

##### BREACH OF A CONTRACT OF SERVICE.

\* 1. <span id="fr_379"></span>[1](#fn_379.md) If a man has promised to
render service and fails to render it, it is termed Breach of a Contract
of Service, a title of law.

\* 2. The sages have distinguished five sorts of attendants according to
law. Among these are four sorts of labourers; the slaves (are the fifth
category, of which there are) fifteen species.

\* 3. <span id="fr_380"></span>[3](#fn_380.md) A student, an apprentice, a
hired servant, and fourthly, an official; these must be regarded as
labourers; slaves are those born in the house and the rest.

\* 4. <span id="fr_381"></span>[4](#fn_381.md) The sages have declared that
the state of dependence is common to all these; but that their
respective position and income depends on their particular caste and
occupation.

\* 5. <span id="fr_382"></span>[5](#fn_382.md) Know that there are two
sorts of occupations; pure work and impure work. Impure work is that
done by slaves. Pure work is that done by labourers.

\* 6. <span id="fr_383"></span>[6](#fn_383.md) Sweeping the gateway, the
privy, the road,

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

and the place for rubbish; shampooing the secret parts of the body;
gathering and putting away the leavings of food, ordure, and urine,

\* 7. And lastly, rubbing the master's limbs when desired; this should
be regarded as impure work. All other work besides this is pure.

\* 8. <span id="fr_384"></span>[8](#fn_384.md) Till he has mastered
science, let a student attend diligently on his teacher. The same
conduct has to be observed by him towards his teacher's wife and son.

\* 9. <span id="fr_385"></span>[9](#fn_385.md) Let him preserve chastity
and beg alms, lying on a low couch and using no ornaments. Let him go to
rest after and rise before all (others who are staying at) his teacher's
house,

\* 10. Let him never come or stay without his teacher's bidding. His
(teacher's) call he must obey without hesitation, when he is able to do
so.

11\. Let him read at the proper time, when his teacher is not averse to
it, sitting on a lower seat than his teacher, by his side, or on a
bench, and paying attention (to what he says).

12. <span id="fr_386"></span>[12](#fn_386.md) Science, like the current of
a stream, is constantly advancing towards the plain. Therefore, let one
studying science be humble towards his teacher.

\* 13. <span id="fr_387"></span>[13](#fn_387.md) His teacher shall correct
him, if he does not

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

pay obedience to him, scolding him or chastising him with a rope or with
a small shoot of cane.

14. <span id="fr_388"></span>[14](#fn_388) (The teacher.md) must not strike
him a heavy blow, nor (must he beat him) on a noble part or on the
chest; and he must encourage him, after having chastised him. Otherwise
the king shall punish him.

\* 15. <span id="fr_389"></span>[15](#fn_389.md) After having completed his
studies, let him give the customary present to his teacher and turn
home. The conduct of a pupil has been declared.

\* 16. <span id="fr_390"></span>[16](#fn_390) If (a young man.md) wishes to
be initiated into the art of his own craft, with the sanction of his
relations, he must go and live with a master, the duration of his
apprenticeship having been fixed.

\* 17. <span id="fr_391"></span>[17](#fn_391.md) The master shall teach him
at his own house and feed him. He must not employ him in work of a
different description, and treat him like a son.

\* 18. <span id="fr_392"></span>[18](#fn_392.md) If one forsakes a master,
who instructs him

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

and whose character is unexceptionable, he may be compelled by forcible
means to remain (at the master's house), and he deserves corporal
punishment and confinement.

\* 19. <span id="fr_393"></span>[19](#fn_393.md) Though his course of
instruction be completed, an apprentice must continue to reside at the
house of his master, till the fixed period has expired. The profit of
whatever work he may be doing there belongs to his master.

\* 20. <span id="fr_394"></span>[20](#fn_394.md) When he has learnt the art
of his craft within the (stipulated) period, the apprentice shall reward
his master as plentifully as he can, and return home, after having taken
leave of him.

21. <span id="fr_395"></span>[21](#fn_395.md) Or, a certain fee having been
agreed upon and the skill of the pupil examined, the apprentice shall
take (his fee) and shall not go to live in the house of another man.

\* 22. Hired servants are of three kinds: highest, middlemost, and
lowest. The wages due for their labour are fixed in proportion to their
skill and to the value of their services.

\* 23. Soldiers constitute the highest class, agriculturists the middle
class, and porters the lowest class. These are the three classes of
hired servants.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

\* 24. <span id="fr_396"></span>[24](#fn_396.md) One appointed to manage
the property (of the family) and to superintend the household, must also
be regarded as a labourer. He is also termed Kau*t*umbika (the general
family servant).

\* 25. Thus have the four classes of servants doing pure work been
enumerated. All the others do dirty work and are slaves, of whom there
are fifteen kinds.

\* 26. <span id="fr_397"></span>[26](#fn_397) One born at (his master's.md)
house; one purchased;

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

one received (by gift); one obtained by inheritance; one maintained
during a general famine; one pledged by his rightful owner;

\* 27. One released from a heavy debt; one made captive in a fight; one
won through a wager; one who has come forward declaring, 'I am thine;'
an apostate from asceticism; one enslaved for a stipulated period;

\* 28. One who has become a slave in order to get a maintenance; one
enslaved on account of his connexion with a female slave; and one
self-sold. These are the fifteen classes of slaves as declared in law.

\* 29. Among these, the four named first cannot be released from
bondage, except by the favour of their owners. Their bondage is
hereditary.

\* 30. <span id="fr_398"></span>[30](#fn_398.md) Should any one out of them
(however) save his master's life, when his life is in peril, he shall be
released from slavery and shall take a son's share (of his master's
wealth).

\* 31. <span id="fr_399"></span>[31](#fn_399.md) One maintained during a
famine is released from bondage if he gives a pair of oxen. It is not

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

by labour (alone) that the value of the food consumed during a famine
can be repaid.

\* 32. One pledged (is released) when his master redeems him by
discharging the debt. If, however, he causes (the pledgee) to take him
in lieu of payment, he becomes equal to a purchased slave.

\* 33. <span id="fr_400"></span>[33](#fn_400.md) It is by paying his debt
with interest, that a debtor is released from slavery. One enslaved for
a stipulated period recovers freedom on the expiration of that period.

\* 34. One who has come forward declaring, 'I am thine,' one made a
prisoner in war, and one won through a wager, these are released on
giving a substitute whose capacity for work is equal to theirs.

\* 35. <span id="fr_401"></span>[35](#fn_401.md) An apostate from
asceticism shall become the king's slave. He can never be emancipated,
nor is there any expiation of his crime.

\* 36. <span id="fr_402"></span>[36](#fn_402.md) One who has become a slave
in order to get a maintenance, is released at once on giving up the said
subsistence. One enslaved on account of his being connected with a
female slave is released on parting with her.

\* 37. That wretch who, being independent, sells himself, is the vilest
of slaves. He cannot be released from bondage.

\* 38. <span id="fr_403"></span>[38](#fn_403.md) Those who are sold after
having been captured by robbers, and those who are enslaved by forcible
means, must be emancipated by the king. Their slavery is not legal.

\* 39. <span id="fr_404"></span>[39](#fn_404.md) In the inverse order of
the (four) castes,

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

slavery is not ordained, except where a man violates the duties peculiar
to his caste. Slavery (in that respect) is analogous to the condition of
a wife.

\* 40. <span id="fr_405"></span>[40](#fn_405.md) If one not his own master
offers himself (as a slave), saying, 'I am thine,' he (to whom he has
offered himself) may not dispose of him. His former master may recover
him when he likes.

\* 41. <span id="fr_406"></span>[41](#fn_406.md) Three persons are declared
to have no proprietary right: a wife, a slave, and a son. Whatever
property they acquire shall be made over to him to whom they belong.

\* 42. <span id="fr_407"></span>[42](#fn_407.md) He who pleased in his mind
wishes to emancipate his own slave, shall take from his (the slave's)
shoulders a jar filled with water and smash it.

\* 43. He shall sprinkle his head with the water, which must contain
whole grain and flowers, and

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

having declared him a free man three times, he shall dismiss him with
his face turned towards the east <span id="fr_408"></span>[1](#fn_408.md).

<span id="fn_386"></span>[132:12](sbe3337.htm#fr_386.md) 'The current of a

13\. Scolding him, i.e. abusing him. A. The Nepalese MS. has a better

&c.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[133:14](sbe3337.htm#fr_388.md) A teacher, though
angry, must not strike his pupil severely, nor on a noble part, nor on

<span id="fn_391"></span>[133:17](sbe3337.htm#fr_391.md) The teacher shall
cause the pupil to do the work peculiar to his own profession, and no

<span id="fn_392"></span>[133:18](sbe3337.htm#fr_392.md) If a pupil
forsakes his teacher, though the latter has not committed a mortal sin
or other heavy crime, the teacher may compel him by forcible means to
remain at his house. A.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[134:19](sbe3337.htm#fr_393.md) The whole gain of
that work which is done by the apprentice while staying at the house of
his master after completing his course of instruction, belongs to the
master, and not to the apprentice. A. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 184.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[134:20](sbe3337.htm#fr_394.md) After the lapse of
the stipulated period, i.e. when the time fixed for his apprenticeship
has expired. A.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[134:21](sbe3337.htm#fr_395.md) The apprentice
shall receive whatever fee has been agreed upon, after his skill has
been examined by the master. A. The only MS. of the earlier recension of
the Nârada-sm*ri*ti breaks off at this paragraph. The remainder of the
present translation has been done from the more recent recension of the
Nârada-sm*ri*ti. See Introduction.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[135:24](sbe3337.htm#fr_396.md) 'The property,'
meaning fields or ready money, &c. 'One appointed to manage it,' i.e.
one deputed to administrate it. Vîramitrodaya, p. 405.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[135:26](sbe3337.htm#fr_397.md) 26-28. 'One born
at (his master's) house,' one born of a female slave in the house (of
her master). 'One received (by gift),' one obtained by the acceptance of
a gift and the like. 'One obtained by inheritance,' a slave of the
father or other ancestor. 'One maintained during a general famine,' one
whose life has been preserved, during a period of dearth, in order that
he might do service (for his preserver). 'One pledged by his rightful
owner,' one reduced to the condition of a pledge, for a loan received
(by his master). 'One released from a heavy debt,' one enslaved for
debt, whose debt has been paid and who has thereby become the slave (of
him who paid the debt). 'One made captive in a fight,' one defeated in a
combat and enslaved by the victorious party. 'One won through a wager,'
one gained through the success of a cause, which was preceded by an
agreement in this form, 'If I am defeated in this quarrel, I will be thy
slave.' 'One who has come forward declaring, "I am thine,"' one who has
promised of his own accord to become the slave of another man. 'An
apostate from asceticism,' one who has forsaken the order of religious
ascetics. 'One enslaved for a stipulated period,' one obtained through
an agreement in this form, 'I will be thy slave for such a space of
time.' 'One who has become a slave in order to get a maintenance,' one
who has offered himself as a slave, on condition that food shall always
be given to him. 'One enslaved on account of his connexion with a female
slave:' by a female slave is meant a female house-slave; one enslaved
for connexion with her is one who has married her through love, and has
thus been reduced to the status of a stave. 'One self-sold' is one who
has sold himself. <span id="page_136">p. 136</span> These are the
fifteen species (of slaves). Mitâksharâ, p. 268. Manu VIII, 415.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[136:30](sbe3337.htm#fr_398.md) This rule is
applicable to any of the fifteen sorts of slaves. Mitâksharâ, p. 269.
Other commentators cite an encounter with a tiger as an instance of a
perilous situation. The slave, in order to obtain release from slavery,
must have risked his own life in rescuing his master.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[136:31](sbe3337.htm#fr_399.md) The objection that
a slave cannot give a pair of oxen, as he has no property of his own
according to Nârada himself (V, 41), may be met by the argument that the
dominion of slaves over affectionate gifts and the like is universally
acknowledged, just as the right of a woman to dispose of Strîdhana given
to her as an affectionate present. See the gloss on this text in
Colebrooke's Digest, III, I, 43.

<span id="fn_400"></span>[137:33](sbe3337.htm#fr_400.md) Yâ*gñ*avalkya II,
182.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[137:35](sbe3337.htm#fr_401.md) Yâ*gñ*avalkya II,
183.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[137:36](sbe3337.htm#fr_402.md) The Mitâksharâ (p.
270) declares that sexual intercourse with a slave is prohibited.
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 182.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[137:38](sbe3337.htm#fr_403.md) Yâ*gñ*avalkya II,
182.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[137:39](sbe3337.htm#fr_404.md) As a man of the
highest caste may marry a wife of an <span id="page_138">p. 138</span>
inferior caste or of his own caste, whereas a woman of the highest caste
is forbidden to marry a man of inferior caste, the same rule should be
observed with regard to a slave. Vîramitrodaya, p. 406. An ascetic who
violates the duties of his order is liable to become the slave of his
inferior in caste even. Mitâksharâ, p. 271. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 183; Manu
VIII, 410-414.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[138:40](sbe3337.htm#fr_405.md) If a man, after
having promised to become the slave of one man, enters the service of
another man afterwards, that other man must relinquish him. 'One not his
own master,' i.e. the slave of another man. Vîramitrodaya, p. 411.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[138:41](sbe3337.htm#fr_406.md) 41. According to
the standard commentators the purport of this rule is merely to indicate
the want of independence of wives, sons, and slaves in the disposal of
their property. See Professor Bühler's note on Manu VIII, 416. Identical
with Manu VIII, 416.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[138:42](sbe3337.htm#fr_407.md) 42, 43. The
breaking of a water-pot which the slave is carrying on his shoulder is
said to be indicative of the discontinuance of the former slave's office
to carry water. The solemn smashing of a water-jar (gha*t*a-spho*t*a)
forms the principal part of another ceremony of a totally different
character as well, viz. of the ceremony of expulsion from caste.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[139:1](sbe3337.htm#fr_408.md) The Indian MSS. and
some quotations insert the following paragraph here, which is omitted in
the Nepalese MS. and in other quotations:—

‘\* 44. From that time let it be said that this slave is cherished by
the favour of his master. His food may be eaten, and presents accepted
from him, and he shall be respected (by worthy persons).’
