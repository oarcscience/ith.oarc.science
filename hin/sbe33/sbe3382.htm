<p>1.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1208"></A><A HREF="#fn_1207"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The whole set of commandments concerning adultery has thus been stated; listen to me proclaiming the conduct prescribed for man and wife.</p>  
<p>2.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1209"></A><A HREF="#fn_1208"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> A woman must be restrained from slight transgressions even by her relations; by night and by day she must be watched by her mother-in-law and other wives belonging to the family.</p>  
<p>3.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1210"></A><A HREF="#fn_1209"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> A father who does not give his daughter in</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_368"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 368</FONT></A></p>  
<p>marriage in proper time (before she has reached maturity), a husband who has not connexion with his wife at the time favourable for procreation, and a son who does not support his mother: all such deserve contempt and shall be punished as ordained in law.</p>  
<p>4.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1211"></A><A HREF="#fn_1210"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Employing (a woman) in the receipt and expenditure (of wealth), in the preparation of food, in the preservation of domestic utensils, in purification, and in the care of the (sacred household) fire, is declared to be the (best) way of guarding women.</p>  
<p>5.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1212"></A><A HREF="#fn_1211"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Let not a woman reside in another man's house, separated from her father, husband, or sons; by (giving way to) malicious propensities, particularly, she is sure to lose her reputation.</p>  
<p>6.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1213"></A><A HREF="#fn_1212"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> Rising before (the others), paying reverence to the elders of the family, preparing food and condiments, and using a low seat and bed: thus have the duties of women been declared.</p>  
<p>7.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1214"></A><A HREF="#fn_1213"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> Drinking (spirituous liquor), rambling abroad, sleeping by day, and neglect of her daily duties, are faults disgracing a woman.</p>  
<p>8.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1215"></A><A HREF="#fn_1214"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> That wife is declared to be devoted to her husband who is afflicted when he is afflicted, pleased when he is happy, squalid and languid when he is absent, and who dies when he dies.</p>  
<p>9.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1216"></A><A HREF="#fn_1215"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> While her husband is absent, a woman must avoid decorating herself, as well as dancing, singing,</p>

<p>looking on at public spectacles or festivals, and using meat or intoxicating drinks.</p>  
<p>10.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1217"></A><A HREF="#fn_1216"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> A wife practising religious austerities, fasting and preserving her chastity, self-controlled and liberal always, goes to heaven even though she have no son.</p>  
<p>11.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1218"></A><A HREF="#fn_1217"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> A wife is considered half the body (of her husband), equally sharing the result of his good or wicked deeds; whether she ascends the pile after him, or chooses to survive him leading a virtuous life, she promotes the welfare of her husband.</p>  
<p>12.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1219"></A><A HREF="#fn_1218"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> The Niyoga (appointment of a widow to raise offspring to her deceased lord) has been declared by Manu, and again prohibited by the same; on account of the successive deterioration of the (four) ages of the world, it must not be practised by mortals (in the present age) according to law.</p>  
<p>13. In the ages K<I>ri</I>ta, Tret&acirc;, and Dv&acirc;para, men were imbued with devotion and sacred knowledge; in the (present or) Kali age, a decrease of its power has been ordained for the human race.</p>  
<p>14. The various sons who were appointed by ancient sages cannot be adopted now by men of the present age, as they are destitute of power.</p>
