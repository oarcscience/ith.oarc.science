#### 9. Pledges.

\* 124. <span id="fr_219"></span>[124](#fn_219.md) That to which a title is
given (adhikriyate) is called a pledge. There are two kinds of it: a

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

pledge which must be redeemed within a certain time, and a pledge which
must be retained till the debt has been discharged.

\* 125. <span id="fr_220"></span>[125](#fn_220.md) A pledge is again
twofold: one to be kept only, and a pledge for enjoyment. It must be
preserved precisely in the same condition (as at the time of its
delivery); otherwise the pledgee loses interest.

\* 126. <span id="fr_221"></span>[126](#fn_221.md) The same thing happens
when the pledge has been injured owing to the negligence of the pledgee.
If it has been lost, the principal is forfeited, provided that the loss
was not caused by fate or the king.

\* 127. <span id="fr_222"></span>[127](#fn_222) A pledge (for custody.md)
must not be used

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

forcibly. The pledgee who uses it forfeits the interest due to him.
Moreover he must make good the value (of the pledge) to the owner.
Otherwise he is (considered as) a thief of the pledge.

128. <span id="fr_223"></span>[128](#fn_223.md) That foolish person who
uses a pledge without authorization from the owner, shall lose one half
of his interest, as a compensation for such use.

129. <span id="fr_224"></span>[129](#fn_224.md) If a pledge for enjoyment
has been given, (the creditor) must not take interest on the loan.
Neither must he give or sell a pledge (of any sort) before the
(stipulated) period has elapsed.

\* 130. <span id="fr_225"></span>[130](#fn_225.md) When a pledge, though
carefully kept, loses its value after a certain time, (the debtor) must
either give another pledge, or discharge the debt to the debtor.

\* 131. <span id="fr_226"></span>[131](#fn_226.md) When a debtor has been
disabled by a reverse of fortune (from paying the debt), he shall be
made to discharge the debt gradually, according to his means, as he
happens to gain property.

\* 132. <span id="fr_227"></span>[132](#fn_227.md) If a wealthy debtor from
malice refuses to

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

pay his debt, the king shall compel him to pay it by forcible means, and
shall take five in the hundred for himself.

133. <span id="fr_228"></span>[133](#fn_228.md) If the debtor acknowledges
the debt with his own mouth, the king shall take from him ten per cent.
(of the debt) as a fine; and twice as much (i.e. twenty per cent.) if he
has been convicted (after denial of the debt).

134. <span id="fr_229"></span>[134](#fn_229.md) If the debtor, owing to a
calamity, has not means sufficient to discharge the whole debt, (the
claim of the creditor) shall be entered in a legal document, specifying
the caste (of the creditor and debtor), their names, and the names of
their neighbours.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_219"></span>[72:124](sbe3316.htm#fr_219.md) According to
Asahâya, the pledge to be released within a specified time is again
twofold. It may be either deposited with a 'keeper of the pledge'
(âdhipâla), who is to return it on the pledge <span id="page_73">p.
73</span> being restored at the time agreed on. Or it may be delivered
to the creditor on condition of its being returned after the lapse of a
certain period, say five or ten years. The usufruct of a 'pledge to be
retained till the debt has been liquidated' shall belong to the creditor
for ever, till the debt has been discharged.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[73:125](sbe3316.htm#fr_220.md) Asahâya gives a
house and a field as instances of a pledge for use. By spoiling a pledge
of this kind, the pledgee forfeits interest, i.e. he loses the produce
of a field, the use of a dwelling-place, &c.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[73:126](sbe3316.htm#fr_221.md) 'Negligence,' with
regard to a bull or other pledge for use, means that it is used at an
unseasonable time, or too much, for drawing a cart or carrying a burden.
With regard to a pledge for custody, it means that it is abandoned.
'When it has been injured,' as e.g. when an animal given as a pledge has
lost one eye. 'The king' may cause the loss of the pledge, if he
confiscates the whole property of a man and the pledge together with it,
on account of a slight offence. The loss is caused 'by fate,' if e.g. a
pledge is stolen by a thief. A. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 59; Vish*n*u VI, 6.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[73:127](sbe3316.htm#fr_222.md) Identical with
Manu VIII, 144. According to Medhâtithi and Kullûka, the provision that
the pledgee must make good the value of the pledge to the owner refers
to those cases where the pledge has been injured or spoiled. According
to Nârâya*n*a, whose opinion is apparently shared by Asahâya, it means
that the pledgee <span id="page_74">p. 74</span> must satisfy the owner
of the pledge out of the profit derived from the use of the pledge.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[74:128](sbe3316.htm#fr_223.md) Nearly identical
with Manu VIII, 150. See Professor Bühler's note.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[74:129](sbe3316.htm#fr_224.md) 'A pledge for
enjoyment' means one where the profit derived from the pledge takes the
place of interest. Such a pledge must not be given or sold before the
term fixed for its delivery. A.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[74:130](sbe3316.htm#fr_225.md) Yâ*gñ*avalkya II,
60.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[74:131](sbe3316.htm#fr_226.md) Where the debtor
is unable to give another pledge or to restore the loan, he must he made
to restore it successively, as best he can, according to his receipts.
A. Manu VIII, 177; IX, 229; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 43.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[74:132](sbe3316.htm#fr_227.md) The king shall
take 5 per cent. as a compensation for the assistance rendered by him.
A. Manu VIII, 139; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 42; Vish*n*u VI, 21.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[75:133](sbe3316.htm#fr_228.md) If the debtor,
when impeached by the creditor, acknowledges the debt himself, the king
shall take 10 per cent. only. If, however, the debtor had undergone the
trouble of proving the correctness of his demand against the creditor,
the king shall take from him twice as much, i.e. 20 per cent. A. Manu
VIII, 139 Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 42; Vish*n*u VI, 20, 21.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[75:134](sbe3316.htm#fr_229.md) If a debtor, who
has been cast in a suit, has not means sufficient to discharge the whole
debt, he shall give a written bond. A. The meaning of the obscure terms
*g*âti, sa*mgñ*â, adhivâsa may be gathered from a text of B*ri*haspati,
which is quoted in Nandapa*nd*ita's Vai*g*ayantî (MS.) III, 74. There
these three terms occur in an enumeration of ten points which have to be
noticed in a written deed concerning landed property. According to
Nandapa*nd*ita, *g*âti denotes the caste, Brahmanical or other, of the
plaintiff and defendant; sa*mgñ*â denotes their names, as e.g.
Devadatta; adhivâsa refers to the names of their neighbours.
