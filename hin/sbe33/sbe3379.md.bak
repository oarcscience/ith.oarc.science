### XXI. ASSAULT.

1. <span id="fr_1168"></span>[1](#fn_1167) Injuring (a man.md) with a hand,
stone, club, or (throwing at him) ashes, or mud, or dust, or (attacking
him with) a weapon, is termed assault.

2. <span id="fr_1169"></span>[2](#fn_1168.md) Throwing ashes or the like
(at a man), or striking him with a hand or the like, is (termed) an
assault of the first degree; the fine to be inflicted in that case shall
amount to a Mâsha.

3\. This fine is ordained for (an assault on) equals in caste; (for
assaults) on another man's wife or on a superior, it shall be twofold or
threefold, according to the sages, according to the rank (of the person
injured).

4. <span id="fr_1170"></span>[4](#fn_1169.md) He who having been abused
returns the abuse, or having been beaten returns the blow, or strikes an
offender down, commits no wrong.

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

5. <span id="fr_1171"></span>[5](#fn_1170.md) When a person throws gravel,
stones, or pieces of wood at another, the first (or lowest) fine shall
be inflicted on him. When they mutually strike one another with a hand
or foot, it shall amount to ten or twenty Pa*n*as respectively.

6. <span id="fr_1172"></span>[6](#fn_1171.md) The second fine shall be
imposed when two persons in anger use weapons against one another; when
a wound has been inflicted, the punishment shall be fixed by experts,
corresponding to the severity of the hurt.

7\. For injuring (a person) with bricks, stones, or a wooden club, (the
fine shall be) two Mâshas; the double fine shall be inflicted, according
to the sages, when blood flows.

8. <span id="fr_1173"></span>[8](#fn_1172.md) For tearing the skin, the
first (or lowest) fine (shall be inflicted); for tearing the flesh, the
second fine; for breaking a bone, the highest fine; for killing, capital
punishment.

9\. For breaking the ear, nose, or hand (of a person), or injuring his
teeth, or feet, the second fine shall be inflicted; and double of that,
for entirely cutting off (any of those limbs).

10. <span id="fr_1174"></span>[10](#fn_1173.md) He who injures a limb, or
divides it, or cuts it off, shall be compelled to pay the expense of
curing it; and (he who- forcibly took an article in a quarrel, shall
restore) his plunder.

11. <span id="fr_1175"></span>[11](#fn_1174.md) When a man has been beaten
in a solitary place, or when no wound is seen, the offender shall

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

be found out by circumstantial evidence or by an oath or ordeal.

12\. When he has been struck in the interior of a house, or in a wood,
or at night, and blood becomes visible, one shall not examine witnesses.

13. <span id="fr_1176"></span>[13](#fn_1175.md) When two persons strike
simultaneously, the punishment shall be equal for both; the first
aggressor and he who is a habitual mischief-maker shall be compelled to
pay a larger fine.

14. <span id="fr_1177"></span>[14](#fn_1176.md) When a low person offends a
man in high position by harsh words or the like, that man must not be
persecuted by the king if he beats his aggressor.

15. <span id="fr_1178"></span>[15](#fn_1177.md) Persons begotten in the
inverse order of castes, and members of the lowest caste, are called the
refuse of society; should they insult a Brahman, they shall be
corporally punished, and shall never be amerced in a fine.

16. <span id="fr_1179"></span>[16](#fn_1178.md) He who employs at an
improper time, for drawing or carrying, tired, or hungry, or thirsty
animals, shall be compelled to atone for it in the same way as a
cow-killer, or to pay the first fine.
