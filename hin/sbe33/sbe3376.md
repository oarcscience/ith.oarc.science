### XVIII. RESCISSION OF PURCHASE AND SALE.

1. <span id="fr_1135"></span>[1](#fn_1134.md) This set of rules concerning
the law of agreements has been briefly stated; disputes arising from
purchase and sale shall be treated next.

2\. Two sorts of property are distinguished, immovable and movable; when
a purchase is concluded, the term 'vendible property' (pa*n*ya) is
applied to both.

3. <span id="fr_1136"></span>[3](#fn_1135.md) The purchaser shall examine a
chattel himself and show it to others; when, after examining and
approving it, he has accepted it, he is not at liberty to return it
again.

4. <span id="fr_1137"></span>[4](#fn_1136.md) The foolish man who sells an
article, though acquainted with its blemish, shall have to pay twice its
value (to the vendee), and (a fine of) the same amount (to the king).

5. <span id="fr_1138"></span>[5](#fn_1137.md) What has been sold by one
intoxicated or insane, or at a very low price, or under the impulse of
fear, or by one not his own master, or by an idiot, shall be
relinquished (by the purchaser, or it) may be recovered (from the
purchaser) by forcible means.

6. <span id="fr_1139"></span>[6](#fn_1138.md) Within that period, if a
blemish should be

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

discovered anywhere in the commodity purchased, it shall be returned to
the vendor, and the purchaser shall recover the price.
