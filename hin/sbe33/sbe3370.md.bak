### XII. DEPOSITS.

1. <span id="fr_1063"></span>[1](#fn_1062.md) The Law of Debt, beginning
with the delivery of a loan and ending with its recovery, has been
declared. Hear, now, the complete set of rules concerning Deposits.

2. <span id="fr_1064"></span>[2](#fn_1063.md) When any chattel is deposited
in the house of another man, through fear of the king, robbers, or other
dangers, or for the purpose of deceiving one's heirs, it is called a
Nyâsa deposit.

3. <span id="fr_1065"></span>[3](#fn_1064.md) When a chattel enclosed in a
cover and marked with a seal (is deposited) without describing its
nature or quantity, and without showing it, it is termed an Aupanidhika
deposit.

4. <span id="fr_1066"></span>[4](#fn_1065.md) Let a man make a deposit,
after duly considering the place, house, master of the house, the power,
means, qualities, veracity, and kindred (of the depositary).

5. <span id="fr_1067"></span>[5](#fn_1066) (A deposit.md) is declared to be
of two sorts:

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

attested, or deposited in private; it must be guarded with the same care
as a son; for it would be destroyed by neglect.

6. <span id="fr_1068"></span>[6](#fn_1067.md) The merit of one who
preserves a deposit or one who places himself under his protection, is
equal to the merit of one who gives (articles made of) gold, or of base
metal, or clothes.

7. <span id="fr_1069"></span>[7](#fn_1068.md) The sin of those who consume
or spoil (by negligence) a bailed chattel is as great as (the sin) of a
woman who injures her husband, or of a man who kills his son or his
friend.

8\. It is the best course not to accept a deposit; but to destroy it
(after having received it) is disgraceful; after having taken it, a man
should keep it carefully and restore it when it has been asked for even
once only.

9. <span id="fr_1070"></span>[9](#fn_1069.md) A deposit must be returned to
the very man who bailed it, in the very manner in which it was bailed;
it must not be delivered to the successor of that man.

10. <span id="fr_1071"></span>[10](#fn_1070.md) When a deposit is
destroyed, together with the goods of the depositary, by the act of fate
or of the king, (the depositary) is not to blame.

11. <span id="fr_1072"></span>[11](#fn_1071.md) If the depositary should
suffer the deposit to be destroyed by his want of care or indifference,
or should refuse to restore it on being asked for it, he shall be made
to pay (the value of) it with interest.

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

12. <span id="fr_1073"></span>[12](#fn_1072) Should any (depositary.md)
procure advantage for himself by an article deposited (with him), he
shall be fined by the king, and compelled to pay its value together with
interest.

13. <span id="fr_1074"></span>[13](#fn_1073.md) He who, after receiving a
deposit, denies the fact, and is convicted by (the evidence of)
witnesses or ordeal, shall be compelled to give up the deposit and to
pay an equal amount as a fine.

14. <span id="fr_1075"></span>[14](#fn_1074.md) When a dispute arises with
regard to a deposit privately made, the performance of an ordeal is
ordained for both parties, to establish the facts of the case.

15. <span id="fr_1076"></span>[15](#fn_1075.md) The same set of rules
applies in the case of a bailment for delivery (to a third person), a
loan for use, an article delivered to an artist (such as gold delivered
to a goldsmith to be worked by him into an earring), a pledge, and a
person offering himself for protection.
