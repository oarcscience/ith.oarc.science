### V. WITNESSES.

1. <span id="fr_752"></span>[1](#fn_751.md) (By false evidence concerning
land, a witness kills everything; beware, then, of giving false evidence
concerning land.) In the case of (false evidence concerning) water, the
consequence is said to be the same as for land, and so it is in the case
of carnal connexion with a female, as well as (in the

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

case of false evidence) concerning gems produced in water, and
everything consisting of stone.

2\. In the case of honey or clarified butter (the consequence) is the
same as (when false evidence has been given) with regard to small
cattle. He incurs the same guilt as in the case of a horse (by giving
false evidence) regarding a vehicle. The case of silver, clothes, grain,
or the Veda is equal to the case of a cow.

3\. Having considered all these evil consequences attending a false
declaration, (a witness) must declare openly everything as (he has)
heard or seen (it).

4. <span id="fr_753"></span>[4](#fn_752.md) Kubera, Âditya, Varu*n*a,
*S*akra (Indra), the son of Vivasvant (Yama), and the (other) guardian
deities of the world are constantly looking on with divine eyes.

5. <span id="fr_754"></span>[5](#fn_753) Let (the judge.md) ask a Brahman
for his testimony by saying, 'Speak;' a Kshatriya by saying, 'Speak the
truth;' a Vai*s*ya, by referring to his kine, grain, and gold; but a
*S*ûdra (by conjuring him) by all possible wicked deeds.

6\. Whatever places (of torment) are assigned (in a future state) to the
murderers of Brahmans, or to the slayers of women and children, and to
him who betrays a friend, or shows ingratitude, those very places shall
be thy home (after death) if thou speakest falsely.

7\. All meritorious deeds which thou, O good man, hast done since thy
birth, would go to the dogs, if thou shouldst speak falsely.

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

8\. Although, O virtuous man, thou thinkest of thyself, 'I am alone,'
yet that says who sees the evil and the good ever resides in thy heart.

9\. If thou art not at variance with the god Yama, the son of Vivasvant,
who resides in thy heart, thou needest not go to the Ganges or to (the
country of) the Kurus.

10 <span id="fr_755"></span>[10](#fn_754.md). Perjured witnesses, as well
as those who rob others of their property, and wicked kings, shall have
to reside (hereafter) in a very dreadful hell for the time of a kalpa.

11. <span id="fr_756"></span>[11](#fn_755) When (a calamity such as.md) an
illness, or fire, or the death of a relative, happens to a witness
within seven days after his evidence has been taken, he shall be made to
pay the debt and a fine.

12. <span id="fr_757"></span>[12](#fn_756.md) Learned Brahmans and other
such persons (are incompetent witnesses) under a text of law; thieves
and the like persons, on account of their notorious perversity; (the
deposition of the witnesses is worthless) owing to mutual contradiction
when the witnesses make mutually conflicting statements at the trial of
a cause.

13\. 'One who gives evidence of his own accord' is a witness who comes
to make a deposition of his own accord, without being appointed (a
witness). Such a man is termed a spy in the law-books, and he is not
worthy to become a witness.

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

14\. 'One rendered incompetent by intervening decease' is a witness (who
comes) after the death of the claimant, unless he should have been
instructed (by the claimant) on his deathbed.
