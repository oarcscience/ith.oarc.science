#### 21. The Ordeal by Fire.

\* 285. <span id="fr_317"></span>[285](#fn_317.md) I will propound, next,
the excellent law regarding the (ordeal by) fire. The interval between

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

every two circles is ordained to measure thirty-two Aṅgulas.

\* 286. Thus the space covered by the eight circles will measure two
hundred and fifty-six Aṅgulas.

\* 287. He should place seven leaves of the holy fig-tree in the hands
of the defendant, and should fasten the leaves (on his hands) with seven
threads.

\* 288. <span id="fr_318"></span>[288](#fn_318.md) A professional
blacksmith, who has practice in working with fire, and whose skill has
been tested on previous occasions, should be caused to heat the iron in
fire.

\* 289, 290. <span id="fr_319"></span>[289](#fn_319.md) An iron ball fifty
Palas in weight having been repeatedly made fiery, sparkling and
red-hot, a pure Brahman who reveres truth, should address it as follows,
when it has been heated thrice: ‘Listen to the law of Manu, which is
superintended by the guardians of the world (themselves).

\* 291. Thou, O fire, art the means of purification and the exalted
mouth of all the gods. Thou, dwelling in the heart of all beings,
knowest this affair.

\* 292. Truth and falsehood proceed from thy tongue. Deign not to show
thyself unworthy of the character thus attributed to thee in the Vedas
and other books.

\* 293. This man (the defendant) has been thus addressed by that man
(the plaintiff), and has denied

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

the charge, (declaring) "I will seize the fire, in order to show that it
is all untrue."

\* 294. Thus confiding in truth, this man is holding thee. Therefore, O
fire, be cool for him, if he speak the truth. If, however, he should
tell a lie, as a sinner, I implore thee, to burn his hands.’

\* 295. This prayer having been carefully written on a leaf and recited,
he should fasten the leaf on his head, and after having done so, should
then give him the iron ball.

\* 296. Having bathed and stepped into the space covered by the (eight)
circles, he should seize the fiery ball, take his stand in one circle,
and walk slowly through the seven others.

\* 297. (The man) must not put it down again till he has passed through
the whole of the measured ground. On reaching the eighth circle, he may
drop the fiery ball.

\* 298. That man who lets the ball drop from fear, or who cannot be
proved to have been burnt, shall take the hot iron once more; this is a
fixed rule.

\* 299. <span id="fr_320"></span>[299](#fn_320.md) Each circle should be
made as broad as his foot. He must not go further than the breadth of
one circle with one step, nor must he remain behind it.

300\. In this way the ordeal by fire should always be performed. It is
adapted for every season except summer and very cold weather.

\* 301. All sores or scars on his hands should be marked with signs
previously, and one should examine the hands again afterwards (and look
after) the dots with which (the sores) have been marked.

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

\* 302. <span id="fr_321"></span>[302](#fn_321.md) If it does not appear
whether (either of) the two hands is burnt, he shall take and seven
times crush grains of rice in his hand, with all his might.

\* 303. The grains having been crushed by him, if the members of the
court should declare him to be unburnt, he shall be honourably released
as being innocent. If he is burnt, he shall receive due punishment.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_317"></span>[108:285](sbe3328.htm#fr_317.md) 285-303. Vish*n*u
XI; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 103-107.

The essential features of the ordeal by fire are as follows: 1. Eight
concentric circles of equal breadth are marked on a piece of ground. 2.
An iron ball is heated repeatedly by a blacksmith. 3. The hands of the
defendant are examined, and all existing sores or scars coloured with
dots. 4. His hands are wrapped up in leaves, in order to protect them
against the hot iron. 5. A prayer addressed to Agni, god of fire, shall
be recited and written on a leaf, which is fastened on the head of the
defendant. 6. The iron ball is placed in his hands, and he is made to
walk slowly through all the circles successively, taking one circle with
each step. On reaching the last circle he may throw the ball on the
ground. 7. His hands are examined once more. If they are found to
contain any fresh sores or wounds, he is guilty; if not, he is innocent.
8. If he lets the ball drop from fear, before having reached the last
circle, or if the examination of his hands has yielded no definite
result, the whole proceeding has to be repeated.

285\. Other legislators state that each circle shall be thirty-two
Aṅgulas broad together with the space situated between it and the next
circle. In par. 299 it is said that the breadth of each circle shall
equal the length of the defendant's foot. This rule, according to the
commentators, refers to the circle minus the intermediate space between
it and the next circle, and means that a <span id="page_109">p.
109</span> circle shall equal the defendant's foot in breadth, where the
foot is longer than sixteen Aṅgulas. Pitâmaha says that the outlines of
the circles shall be marked with cow-dung.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[109:288](sbe3328.htm#fr_318.md) 'A professional
blacksmith,' not one officiating temporarily in that capacity. A.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[109:289](sbe3328.htm#fr_319.md) 289, 290. The
Vîramitrodaya says that the iron ball shall be put into cold water,
after it has been heated for the first and second times.

tatpadasa*m*mitam in the text.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[111:302](sbe3328.htm#fr_321.md) 302, 303. The
crushing of grains of rice serves the purpose of making visible such
wounds as might have been overlooked previously. Here ends the section
of the ordeal by fire. A.
