### XV. RESUMPTION OF GIFTS.

1. <span id="fr_1103"></span>[1](#fn_1102.md) The system of rules relative
to Concerns of a Partnership has been fully declared thus; the rules
regarding what may, or may not, be given, valid, and invalid gifts, will
be declared (next).

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

2. <span id="fr_1104"></span>[2](#fn_1103.md) That which may not be given
is declared to be of eight sorts, joint property, a son, a wife, a
pledge, one's entire wealth, a deposit, what has been borrowed for use,
and what has been promised to another.

3. <span id="fr_1105"></span>[3](#fn_1104.md) What remains after defraying
(the necessary expenses for) the food and clothing of his family, may be
given by a man; otherwise (by giving more than that), the religious
merit (supposed to be acquired by the giver) though tasting like honey
at first, will change into poison in the end.

4. <span id="fr_1106"></span>[4](#fn_1105) When any field (or house.md) is
given away, belonging to a number of houses or fields acquired in one of
the seven modes of (lawful) acquisition, it is ordained to be viewed as
a valid gift, whether it have been inherited from the father or acquired
by the donor himself.

5\. Self-acquired property may be given away at pleasure (by its owner);
a pledge may be disposed of according to the rules of mortgage; in the
case of property received as a marriage portion, or inherited from an
ancestor, the bestowal of the whole is not admitted.

6\. When, however, a marriage gift, or inherited property, or what has
been obtained by valour, is

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

given with the assent of the wife, kinsmen, or supreme ruler, the gift
acquires validity.

7\. Co-heirs (or joint-tenants), whether divided in interests or not,
have an equal claim to the immovable wealth; a single (parcener) has no
power to give, mortgage, or sell the whole (wealth).

8. <span id="fr_1107"></span>[8](#fn_1106.md) The following eight sorts of
gifts are recognised as valid by persons acquainted with the law of
gift, viz. wages, (what was given) for the pleasure (of hearing bards,
or the like), the price of merchandise, the fee paid for (or to) a
damsel, (and what was given) to a benefactor (as a return for his
kindness), through reverence, kindness, or affection.

9. <span id="fr_1108"></span>[9](#fn_1107.md) What has been given by one
angry, or resenting an injury, or through inadvertence, or by one
distressed, by a minor, a madman, one terrified, intoxicated, overaged,
cast out from society, idiotic, or afflicted with grief or an illness,

10\. Or what is given in jest; all such gifts are declared to be void
gifts.

11. <span id="fr_1109"></span>[11](#fn_1108.md) When anything has been
given through desire of a reward, or to an unworthy man mistaken for a
worthy person, or for an immoral purpose, the owner may resume the gift.

The seven modes of acquisition are, according to Manu (X, 115),
inheritance, finding, purchase, conquest, lending at interest, doing
work, and the acceptance of gifts from virtuous men. The prohibition to
give away the whole, in 5, relates to property acquired by valour as
well, according to the Ratnâkara. The clause translated by 'bestowal of
the whole' may also mean, 'every gift,' i.e. a gift not sanctioned by
the persons referred to in 6.
