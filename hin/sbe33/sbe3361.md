### III. THE PLAINT.

1. <span id="fr_893"></span>[1](#fn_892.md) The part called the
declaration; the part called the answer; the part called the trial; and
the part called the deliberation of the judges regarding the onus
probandi: these are the four parts of a judicial proceeding.

2\. The plaint is called the (first) part; the answer is the second
part; the trial is the third part; and the judgment is the fourth part.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

3. <span id="fr_894"></span>[3](#fn_893.md) In the case of a denial, (a
judicial proceeding) consists of four parts; likewise, in the case of a
special plea; the same rule applies to a plea of former judgment; but in
the case of a confession, it has two parts only.

4. <span id="fr_895"></span>[4](#fn_894.md) When plaintiff and defendant
come together, each claiming to be first, their declarations should be
received in the order of their castes, or after considering their
respective grievances.

5. <span id="fr_896"></span>[5](#fn_895.md) Those acquainted with (the true
nature of) a plaint declare that to be a (proper) plaint, which is free
from the defects of a declaration, susceptible of proof, provided with
good arguments, precise, and reasonable,

6\. Brief in words, rich in contents, unambiguous, free from confusion,
devoid of improper arguments, and capable of meeting opposite arguments;

7\. When a plaint of this description has been proffered by the
plaintiff, the defendant should tender an answer conformable to such
plaint.

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

8. <span id="fr_897"></span>[8](#fn_896.md) The above and other qualities
(of a plaint) having been duly considered, a plaint (containing them)
may be regarded as a proper plaint; one not answering this description
is a mere semblance of a plaint.

9. <span id="fr_898"></span>[9](#fn_897) That (plaint.md) which (mentions
an act that) has never been done by anybody is called impossible; one
referring to a slight offence, or to a trifling sum, is called
unmeaning; one in which neither a demand nor a grievance is referred to,
should be known to be purposeless.

10. <span id="fr_899"></span>[10](#fn_898) (Or.md) that plaint is unmeaning
which does not concern one of the (fourteen) titles of law relating to
the lending of money at interest and so forth; and that plaint is
purposeless which does not concern one of the (four) titles of law
relating to insult and so forth.

11. <span id="fr_900"></span>[11](#fn_899) (When a claimant declares.md):
This man is bound to give me a bow made of the horn of a hare, the wise
declare such a plaint to be unreasonable and unsusceptible of proof.

12\. When the interests of a town or kingdom are violated by bringing a
certain plaint before a chief judge or before the king, it is termed a
plaint contrary (to equity).

13. <span id="fr_901"></span>[13](#fn_900) When a man, (whether.md) acting
as plaintiff (or as defendant), is forsaken by his strength on being
about to make a statement in a suit, it is proper

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

that a delay should be granted to him, according to circumstances and
according to his ability.

14. <span id="fr_902"></span>[14](#fn_901.md) Let him remove superfluous
statements and amplify incomplete ones, and let him write down
(everything) on the floor, till the (whole) matter has been definitely
stated.

15. <span id="fr_903"></span>[15](#fn_902.md) The plaintiff is at liberty
to alter his declaration, when it is defective or redundant, till the
defendant has tendered his answer in the presence of the judges.

16. <span id="fr_904"></span>[16](#fn_903.md) When the plaintiff through
timorousness does not dare to speak, it devolves on the judges to amend
his declaration, according to the circumstances of the case.

17\. A charge founded on suspicion, (one founded on) fact, a petition
regarding the recovery of a debt, and claiming a fresh trial of a cause
previously tried: thus a plaint is represented as fourfold.

18\. The plaint is fourfold, and so is the answer; the judgment is
declared to be of four kinds also; by some it is represented as being of
eight sorts.

19\. Suspicion is explained to mean doubt; fact is (said to be) an
insight into the real nature of a matter; a petition regarding the
recovery of a debt is (plea of) error; a fresh trial is the repetition
of a previous trial.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[290:4](sbe3361.htm#fr_895.md) Vîram. p. 60. 'When
Brahmans and others have entered the judicial assembly simultaneously,
the four parts of a judicial proceeding should be instituted in the
order of their castes, the Brahman's cause being tried first of all by
the king, then the Kshatriya's, and so on, in the order (of their
castes). If the comparative importance or heaviness of the respective
grievances of each party differs, the order in which the causes are
tried is not made to depend either on the relative priority of each
declaration, or on the respective caste of the parties. If they are all
of equal caste, the relative priority of the declarations is taken into
account. If the declarations have been simultaneous, and if the
litigants are equal in caste, and their grievances are also equal, the
order is made to depend on the choice of the judge and of the assessors
of the court.' Vîram.
