# SEVENTH TITLE OF LAW.

##### SALES EFFECTED BY ANOTHER THAN THE RIGHTFUL OWNER.

\* 1. <span id="fr_428"></span>[1](#fn_428.md) When property kept as a
deposit, or the property of a stranger lost (by him) and found (by
another man), or stolen articles, are sold in secret, it has to be
considered as a 'Sale Effected by Another than the Rightful Owner.'

\* 2. <span id="fr_429"></span>[2](#fn_429.md) When a chattel, which had
been sold by another person than the owner, has been recovered

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

by the owner, he may keep it. No blame attaches to a sale effected in
public, but a clandestine sale is viewed in the same light as theft
according to law.

\* 3. <span id="fr_430"></span>[3](#fn_430.md) If a man buys from a slave
who has not been authorized (to sell) by his master, or from a rogue, or
in secret, or at a very low price, or at an improper time, he is as
guilty as the seller.

\* 4. <span id="fr_431"></span>[4](#fn_431.md) The purchaser must not make
a secret of the way in which he came by a chattel (purchased by him). He
becomes free from blame if he can point out the way in which the chattel
was acquired by him. In any other case he is equally guilty with the
vendor, and shall suffer the punishment of a thief.

\* 5. <span id="fr_432"></span>[5](#fn_432.md) The vendor shall restore his
property to the rightful owner, and shall pay to the buyer the price for
which it was sold to him; besides that he shall pay a fine to the king.
Such is the rule in the case

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

of a sale effected by another than the rightful owner.

6. <span id="fr_433"></span>[6](#fn_433.md) If any one finds a treasure,
which had been deposited by a stranger, he shall take it to the king.
Every treasure, found by members of any caste, belongs to the king,
excepting (those treasures which have been found by) members of the
Brahman caste.

7\. A Brahman even, when he has found a treasure, must at once give
notice to the king. If the king gives it to him he may enjoy it. If he
does not give notice, he is (viewed as) a thief.

8\. Of his own property also, which he had lost and found again
afterwards, a man must give notice to the king. If he does so, he may
keep it as his lawful property. It is not his lawful property otherwise.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_428"></span>[144:1](sbe3339.htm#fr_428.md) VII, 1. The term
'property kept as a deposit' includes by implication a Yâ*k*ita and the
other species of bailments. Vîramitrodaya, p. 374, and the other
commentaries. See II. Title of Law, 14, 15.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[144:2](sbe3339.htm#fr_429.md) The owner of a
chattel, which has been sold by a stranger who has no right to it, may
reclaim it from any one who happens to be possessed of it.
Vîramitrodaya, P. 375; Vish*n*u V, 164-166; Manu VIII, 201, 202;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 168. In the Nepalese MS. the last clause runs as
follows: 'The buyer who buys in secret is guilty of theft.'

<span id="fn_430"></span>[145:3](sbe3339.htm#fr_430.md) 'One who has not
been authorized (to sell) by his master,' one who has received no
special permission from him (to sell the chattel). The term 'a slave'
has to be interpreted in a pregnant sense, so as to include young sons
and other dependent persons. Vîramitrodaya, p. 375. Vish*n*u V, 166;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 168.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[145:4](sbe3339.htm#fr_431.md) It appears from the
detailed provisions of B*ri*haspati, Kâtyâyana, and other
Sm*ri*ti-writers on the subject of purchase and sale, that every
purchase, in order to be legitimate, had to be concluded in open market,
on a market day or hour; or that, at least, the purchaser was required
to produce the vendor, when the purchase had not been made in open
market. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 168. The Nepalese MS. inserts the following
paragraph here: 'Any purchase or sale which has been effected by another
than the rightful owner must be known to be invalid; this is a rule in
lawsuits.' The quotations in the Vîramitrodaya and other works prove
this verse to be genuine. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 170.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[145:5](sbe3339.htm#fr_432.md) Yâ*gñ*avalkya II,
170.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[146:6](sbe3339.htm#fr_433.md) 6-8. Gautama X,
36-38, 43-45; Vasish*th*a III, 13-14; XVI, 19, 20; Manu VIII, 30-39;
Vish*n*u V, 56-64; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 33-35. The position of the two last
paragraphs is inverted in the Nepalese MS.
