### THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.

1. <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md) <span class="smallcaps">Holy
Manu</span>, in order to promote the welfare of all beings, composed a
book here, which was to become the foundation of the established rule of
conduct. It was made up of twenty-four sections, on (1) the creation of
the world; (2) the various kinds of living beings; (3) the extent of the
virtuous

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

country; (4) the constitution of a judicial assembly; (5) the
performance of offerings according to the Vedas and Vedâṅgas; (6)
established usage; (7) forensic law; (8) the extirpation of offenders;
(9) the mode of life of a king; (10, 11) the system of the (four) castes
and (four) orders; (12) marriage laws; (13) the mutual relations between
husband and wife; (14) the order of succession; (15) the performance of
obsequies; (16) the elucidation of difficult points regarding
purification; (17) the rule as to what may be eaten and what not; (18,
19) the law regarding vendible commodities, and those which must not be
sold; (20) the various kinds of crime; (21) heaven and hell; (22)
penances; (23) the Upanishads; (24) secret doctrines.

2. <span id="fr_19"></span>[2](#fn_19.md) Holy Manu, after having thus
(composed) that (book) in a hundred thousand *s*lokas, and in one
thousand and eighty chapters, delivered it to the divine sage Nârada. He
having learnt it from him, reflecting that a work of this kind could not
be remembered easily by mortals on account of its size, abridged it in
twelve thousand (*s*lokas) and delivered it to the great sage
Mârka*nd*eya.

3. <span id="fr_20"></span>[3](#fn_20.md) He having learnt it from him, and
reflecting on

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

the (limited duration and) capacity of human life, reduced it to eight
thousand (*s*lokas), and delivered this (abridgment) to Sumati, the son
of Bh*ri*gu.

4. <span id="fr_21"></span>[4](#fn_21.md) Sumati, the son of Bh*ri*gu,
after having learnt (this book) from him and considered what human
capacity had been brought down to through the (successive) lessening of
life (in the four ages of the world), reduced it to four thousand
(*s*lokas).

5. <span id="fr_22"></span>[5](#fn_22) It is this (abridgment.md) which
Manes and mortals read, whilst the gods, Gandharvas, and other (exalted
beings) read in extenso the (original) code, consisting of one hundred
thousand (*s*lokas). There the first *s*loka runs as follows: 'This
universe was wrapped up in darkness, and nothing could be discerned.
Then the holy, self-existent Spirit issued forth with his four faces.'

6. <span id="fr_23"></span>[6](#fn_23.md) After this exordium, chapter
follows chapter

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

continuously. There the ninth chapter is headed, 'Judicial Procedure.'
There Nârada, the divine sage, composed an Introduction in the Sûtra
style, as follows. It begins with the following *s*loka.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_18"></span>[1:1](sbe3304.htm#fr_18.md) Regarding the
historical value and bearing of this Preface, see Introduction. The
table of contents, which is here given for the original Code of Manu,
corresponds in the main to the contents of the now extant version of
that work. Thus the creation of the world is treated of, Manu I, 5-57;
the various kinds of living beings, I, 34-50; the virtuous countries,
II, 17-23; the constitution of a judicial assembly, XII, 108-114; the
performance of offerings, III, 69-286; IV, 21-28, &c.; established usage
(Â*k*âra), passim, all the multifarious rules of private morals and
social economy falling under this head; forensic law, chapters VIII and
IX; the extirpation of offenders, IX, 252-293; the mode of life of a
king, chapter VII; the system of the four castes and four orders, I,
87-101; IX, 325-336, &c.; marriage laws, III, 1-62; the mutual relations
between husband and wife, IX, 1-103; the order of succession, IX,
103-220; the performance of obsequies, III, 122-286; rules of
purification, V, 57-146; rules of diet, V, 1-56; saleable commodities,
and those which may not be sold, X, 85-94; the classification of
offences, XI, 55-71; the twenty-one hells, IV, 88-90; penances, XI, 72-
266. The Upanishads are frequently referred to, e.g. II, 165; VI, 29.
Secret or mysterious doctrines are e.g. those taught in the twelfth
chapter of the Code of Manu. A somewhat analogous table of contents of
the Code of Manu is given in that work itself, I, 111-118.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[2:2](sbe3304.htm#fr_19.md) The Manu who is
referred to in this place is no doubt Manu Svâya*m*bhuva, or 'Manu
sprung from the self-existent Being,' to whom the Code of Manu is said
to have been revealed by Brahman; see Manu I, 58. Nârada is one of the
seven principal *Ri*shis. He is also reckoned among the Pra*g*âpatis,
'lords of creatures' or 'creators,' and is viewed as the chief of
heavenly musicians. Mârka*nd*eya is elsewhere called 'the long-lived,'
and is celebrated for his austerities. He is the reputed author of a
well-known Purâ*n*a, called after him the Mârka*nd*eya Purâ*n*a.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[2:3](sbe3304.htm#fr_20.md) Bh*ri*gu, one of the
great *Ri*shis of antiquity, is in the Code of Manu introduced as a son
of Manu, and as the compiler of the <span id="page_3">p. 3</span>
present version of the Code of Manu; see Manu I, 35, 59, 60. The fact of
his being mentioned here as the father of Sumati, the compiler of the
final recension of the Code of Manu, renders it probable that this work
may have closely resembled the now extant Code of Manu. However, the
latter work has not more than 2684 *s*lokas, instead of the 4000
attributed to the version of Sumati.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[3:4](sbe3304.htm#fr_21.md) As for the successive
lessening of life, and general deterioration of the world, in the four
ages, K*ri*ta, Tretâ, Dvâpara, and Kali, see Manu I, 81-86.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[3:5](sbe3304.htm#fr_22.md) A. observes expressly
that the term 'there' refers to the original Code in 100,000 *s*lokas.
The *s*loka here quoted is nearly identical with Manu I, 5 a, 6 a.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[3:6](sbe3304.htm#fr_23.md) The Mât*ri*kâ or
'Introduction' (compare divyamât*ri*kâ, a 'general introduction to the
law regarding ordeals,' in the Mitâksharâ, p. 139) which is here
attributed to Nârada, appears to have formed part of the abridgment in
12,000 *s*lokas, which was originally composed by him. It was composed
in the Sûtra style, i.e. it was made up of aphorisms. The *s*lokas are
frequently designed as Sutras by the commentators of law-books.
Supposing this work to have consisted of twelve chapters, like the
present Code <span id="page_4">p. 4</span> of Manu, each chapter would
have contained about 1000 *s*lokas. The Nârada-sm*ri*ti actually has
about 1000 *s*lokas. In the Code of Manu, forensic law is treated in the
eighth and ninth chapters. The compiler of the present work declares his
composition to be the ninth chapter of Nârada's abridged version of the
Code of Manu. In the above enumeration of twenty-four subjects treated
in the original Code of Manu, judicial procedure is introduced as the
seventh and eighth subject. This coincidence indeed might be accidental.
