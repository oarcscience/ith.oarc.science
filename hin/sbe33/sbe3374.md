### XVI. MASTER AND SERVANT.

1. <span id="fr_1110"></span>[1](#fn_1109.md) What may not be given and
kindred subjects have been declared; the law of servants shall be
propounded next. (There) the title of Breach of Promised Obedience is
treated first.

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

2\. The titles of non-payment of wages, and then (of disputes) between
the owner (of cattle) and his servants are to follow in due order. Such
are the three divisions of (the law of) servants.

3. <span id="fr_1111"></span>[3](#fn_1110.md) They are pronounced to be of
many sorts, according to their particular caste and occupation; and
fourfold, according as they serve for science, human knowledge (or
skill), love, or gain.

4\. Each of these is again divided (into several species), according to
the difference of occupation.

5. <span id="fr_1112"></span>[5](#fn_1111.md) Science is declared to be a
knowledge of (one of) the three Vedas, called Rig-veda, Sâma-veda, and
Ya*g*ur-veda; for the purpose of acquiring such knowledge, he should pay
obedience to a spiritual teacher, as ordained in law.

6. <span id="fr_1113"></span>[6](#fn_1112) Arts (consisting of.md) work in
gold, base metals, and the like, and the art of dancing and the rest are
termed human knowledge; he who studies them should do work at his
teacher's house.

7. <span id="fr_1114"></span>[7](#fn_1113.md) He who has intercourse with
another man's female slave, should be considered as a slave for the sake
of his paramour; he must do work for her master, like another hired
servant.

8. <span id="fr_1115"></span>[8](#fn_1114) The servant for gain (or pay.md)
is declared to be of many sorts, another is the servant for a share (of
the gain). Of all, a low, a middle, and a high sort is distinguished.

9\. A servant engaged for a day, a month, half a month, a sixmonth, two
months, or a year, must do

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

the work which he promised to do, and receives the stipulated fee.

10\. The warrior is the highest of these; the cultivator of the soil is
the middlemost; the porter is declared to be the lowest, and so is (a
servant) employed in household work.

11\. A servant for a share of the gain is declared to be twofold, either
serving a husbandman or an owner of cattle; he shall receive, no doubt,
a share of the grain produced, or of the milk.

12. <span id="fr_1116"></span>[12](#fn_1115.md) A third or a fifth (of the
produce) shall be awarded to the cultivator of the soil as his share.

13\. Let that cultivator to whom food and clothing is given take a fifth
of the crop; and let him who serves in consideration of the profit
(alone) take a third part of the grain produced.

14. <span id="fr_1117"></span>[14](#fn_1116.md) Should a hired servant fail
in the performance of ever so small a part of his master's work, he
forfeits his wages, and may be sued in court for his offence.

15\. When a servant does not perform his work after having received his
wages, though able (to do work), he shall be compelled to pay twice as
much (as his wages) as a fine (to the king), and (shall restore) the
wages (to his master).

16. <span id="fr_1118"></span>[16](#fn_1117.md) He who has promised (to do
work) and does not perform it, shall be compelled to do so by forcible
means even; and if, through obstinacy, such a servant should still not
do it as engaged for, he shall be fined

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

eight K*ri*sh*n*alas, and his wages shall not be paid to him.

17. <span id="fr_1119"></span>[17](#fn_1118.md) When a servant,
commissioned by his master, does any improper act (such as theft) for
the benefit of his master, the latter shall be held responsible for it.

18. <span id="fr_1120"></span>[18](#fn_1119.md) When a master does not pay
wages for the labour stipulated after the work has been performed, he
shall be compelled by the king to pay it, and a proportionate fine
besides.

19. <span id="fr_1121"></span>[19](#fn_1120) (A man.md) hired for
attendance on milch cows of another shall receive the whole milk every
eighth day.

20. <span id="fr_1122"></span>[20](#fn_1121) (A cowherd.md) shall save
cattle from danger of reptiles, robbers, and tigers, and from caverns or
pits; let him try his best to protect them, call out for help, or give
notice to his master.
