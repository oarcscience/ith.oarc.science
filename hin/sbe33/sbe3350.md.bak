# APPENDIX.

##### THEFT <span id="fr_672"></span>[1](#fn_672.md).

1. <span id="fr_673"></span>[1](#fn_672.md) Two kinds of robbers who steal
the goods of others have to be distinguished, the one kind open, and the
other kind concealed. Let a prudent king try to find them out.

\* 2. Open rogues are those who forge measures and weights, receivers of
bribes, robbers, gamblers, public prostitutes,

\* 3. Those who walk in disguise, those who live by teaching the
performance of auspicious ceremonies, these and such like persons are
considered open rogues.

\* 4. Rogues acting in secret are those who roam in the wood, or lie
concealed, as well as those who make a profession of stealing. They
attack and rob (those who do not beware of them).

5\. Those who infest a country, a village, or a house, or disturb a
sacrificial act, cut-purses, and

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

other persons of this sort have to be considered as concealed rogues
also.

\* 6. Blameless persons with whom the stolen goods are not found must
not be chastised as robbers by the king; but let him quickly punish
those robbers as guilty of theft with whom the stolen goods have been
found.

\* 7. Those (rogues) who ravage in their own country, and those who
disturb sacrificial acts, he shall strip of their entire wealth and
rebuke them severely.

\* 8. Those on whom the stolen goods have not been seized he must
examine, when they have been arrested from suspicion. Their fear having
been excited, they will give evidence, through anxiety, in accordance
with the facts of the case.

\* 9. <span id="fr_674"></span>[9](#fn_673.md) Questions shall be proposed
to them antithetically with regard to place, time, region, their caste,
their name, their dwelling, and their occupation, in case they happen to
be workmen.

\* 10. <span id="fr_675"></span>[10](#fn_674.md) When the face changes
colour or the voice falters, or the features look suspicious, when they
do not give evidence in public, when they make impossible statements as
to place and time, when there exists a doubt as to their place of
residence,

\* 11. When they indulge in expense for bad purposes, when they have
been previously convicted of larceny, when they keep bad company, or
when documents speak against them, (by all such circumstances)

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

they may be discovered (to be thieves), not by the possession of the
stolen goods alone.

\* 12. <span id="fr_676"></span>[12](#fn_675.md) When a ruffian or robber
becomes suspected, and (the judge) has found out circumstantial evidence
(which speaks against him), he shall be caused to make an oath.

\* 13. <span id="fr_677"></span>[13](#fn_676.md) Those who give food to
thieves, as well as those who supply them with fire or water, or who
give shelter, or show the way to them, or make their defence,

\* 14. Or who buy their goods, or receive (their goods), are held to be
equally punishable as they, and so are those who conceal them.

15. <span id="fr_678"></span>[15](#fn_677.md) Those who in a principality
are the governors of that principality, and the neighbours called in (to
watch over the safety of life and property) are (reckoned as) equal to
thieves, when they stand neutral during the attack (of robbers).

\* 16. <span id="fr_679"></span>[16](#fn_678.md) He on whose ground a
robbery has been committed, must trace the thieves to the best of his
power, or else he must make good what has been stolen, unless the
footmarks can be traced from that ground (into another man's ground).

17. <span id="fr_680"></span>[17](#fn_679.md) When the footmarks, after
leaving that ground, are lost and cannot be traced any further, the
neighbours, inspectors of the road, and governors of that region shall
be made responsible for the loss.

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

18\. When a house has been plundered, the king shall cause the
thief-catchers, the guards, and the inhabitants of that kingdom to make
good the loss, when the thief is not caught.

19. <span id="fr_681"></span>[19](#fn_680.md) Or, if he is a wicked man and
there exists a doubt as to (whether) the robbery (was actually committed
or not), the person (alleged to have been) robbed shall be caused to
make an oath regarding the robbery, to clear himself (from suspicion).

20\. When another person than the thief has been accused of robbery and
has been declared thief, because he is unable to prove his innocence, he
shall be paid twice as much (as has been stolen), after the (real) thief
has been detected.

21\. When a man has obtained property stolen by a thief, he must restore
it in its pristine shape; if it be no longer in existence, he must make
good its value, and must be made to pay a fine to the same amount.

\* 22. <span id="fr_682"></span>[22](#fn_681.md) For stealing wood, cane,
grass and the like, (utensils) made of clay, bamboo, utensils made of
bamboo, rattan, bone, leather,

\* 23. Vegetables, green roots, grass or flowers, cow-milk, molasses,
salt, or oil,

\* 24. Cooked food (and other) prepared food, spirituous liquor, flesh,
and every sort of objects of small value—(for stealing any of these) a
fine five times the value (of the article stolen should be paid).

\* 25. <span id="fr_683"></span>[25](#fn_682) (For stealing.md) any
articles sold by weight or measure or tale, the fine shall be eight
times their amount, in case they are very valuable.

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

26. <span id="fr_684"></span>[26](#fn_683.md) Corporal punishment (or
death) shall be inflicted on him who steals more than ten Kumbhas of
grain; where the amount is less, he shall be made to pay eleven times as
much. Thus Manu has declared.

\* 27. <span id="fr_685"></span>[27](#fn_684) (For stealing.md) more than a
hundred (Palas’ worth) of gold, silver, or other (precious metals), or
the finest clothes, or very precious gems, corporal punishment (or death
shall be inflicted).

28\. He who steals a man shall have to pay the highest fine; he who
steals a woman (shall be stripped) of his entire wealth; and he who
steals a maiden (shall suffer) corporal punishment.

\* 29. <span id="fr_686"></span>[29](#fn_685.md) On him who forcibly seizes
large domestic animals, the highest fine shall be inflicted; the
middlemost amercement on him who takes cattle of middle size; and the
smallest fine on him who steals small cattle.

30. <span id="fr_687"></span>[30](#fn_686) The first (or lowest.md) fine to
be inflicted on a guilty person shall amount to neither more nor less
than twenty-four (Pa*n*as). The middlemost fine shall consist of not
more than four hundred, and not less than two hundred (Pa*n*as).

31\. The highest fine should be known to consist of not more than a
thousand, and not less than five hundred (Pa*n*as). This is the
threefold gradation of punishment, which has been proposed by the
Self-Existent for robberies.

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

\* 32. <span id="fr_688"></span>[32](#fn_687.md) (When the offence has been
committed) for the first time, cut-purses shall have their (little)
finger and thumb cut off. (When it has been committed) for the second
time, the first fine shall be levied on them.

\* 33. <span id="fr_689"></span>[33](#fn_688) For (stealing.md) cows
belonging to a Brahman, for piercing (the nostrils of) a barren cow, and
for stealing a female slave, (the thief) shall in every case lose half
his feet.

34. <span id="fr_690"></span>[34](#fn_689.md) With whatever limb a thief
acts among men, that very (limb) shall be taken from him, this is a law
enacted by Manu.

35\. Let him inflict a specially heavy punishment on a specially
criminal thief, or (a lighter one) on one whose offence is less heavy.
But let him not (punish an habitual thief) in the same way as for the
first offence.

36. <span id="fr_691"></span>[36](#fn_690.md) Manu, the son of the
Self-Existent, has declared ten places of punishment, which should be
(selected) in (punishing members of the) three (lower) castes; a Brahman
should remain uninjured always.

37\. (Those places are) the privy parts, the belly, the tongue, the two
hands, and, fifthly, the two feet; as well as the eye, the nose, the two
ears, the property, and the body.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

38. <span id="fr_692"></span>[38](#fn_691.md) After carefully considering
the (nature of the) offence, the place and time, and after examining the
ability (of the offender), and the motive (by which he was actuated), he
shall inflict these punishments.

39. <span id="fr_693"></span>[39](#fn_692.md) Neither for the purpose of
gaining a friend (in him), nor for the acquisition of large wealth, must
a wicked criminal be suffered to go free by the king. Thus Manu has
declared.

40. <span id="fr_694"></span>[40](#fn_693.md) By pardoning an offender, a
king commits the same offence as by punishing an innocent man. Religious
merit accrues to him from punishing (the wicked).

41. <span id="fr_695"></span>[41](#fn_694.md) Let him not on any account
kill a Brahman, though convicted of all possible crimes. He may at
pleasure cause him to be banished, thus has the law been settled.

42. <span id="fr_696"></span>[42](#fn_695.md) Let the king take his entire
wealth from him or leave him a fourth part of it (only he must not take
his life), remembering the law promulgated by the Creator. This is just.

43. <span id="fr_697"></span>[43](#fn_696.md) For four offences of a
Brahman, branding him is ordained (as punishment): for violating the bed
of a Guru, for drinking spirituous liquor, for theft, and for hurting
another Brahman.

\* 44. <span id="fr_698"></span>[44](#fn_697.md) For violating the bed of a
Guru, (the brand of) a female part should be made; for drinking

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

spirituous liquor, (the brand of) a liquor sign is ordained; for theft,
he shall make (the brand of) a dog's foot (on his forehead).

45\. The slayer of a Brahman shall have (the brand of) a headless man
stamped on his forehead, and it is forbidden to speak to him. This is a
law enacted by Manu.

46. <span id="fr_699"></span>[46](#fn_698.md) A thief must approach the
king with flying hair, running, and proclaiming his theft (with the
words): 'Thus have I acted. Chastise me.'

47\. By so doing he is cleared from guilt, because he has confessed his
deed; the king, thereupon, shall touch him (with a club), or dismiss
him, if he is innocent.

48. <span id="fr_700"></span>[48](#fn_699.md) Those men who have received a
punishment from the king for an offence committed by them, proceed to
heaven, free from sin, as (if they were) virtuous men who had acted
well.

49. <span id="fr_701"></span>[49](#fn_700.md) Whether he be punished or
released, the thief is freed from his crime; if, however, the king does
not punish him, the crime committed by the thief falls on (the king)
himself.

50\. Self-possessed men are corrected by their Guru; wicked men are
corrected (or punished) by the king; but those who have sinned in secret
are corrected by Yama, the son of Vivasvat.

51. <span id="fr_702"></span>[51](#fn_701.md) The crime of a *S*ûdra in
theft is eightfold (that of a man of the lowest caste) of a Vai*s*ya,
sixteenfold; and of a Kshatriya, thirty-twofold.

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

52. <span id="fr_703"></span>[52](#fn_702.md) Of a Brahman, sixty-fourfold;
thus the son of the Self-Existent has declared. Knowledge makes a
difference also. For knowing persons, (the punishment) is specially
severe.

\* 53. <span id="fr_704"></span>[53](#fn_703.md) <span
id="fr_705"></span>[56](#fn_705.md) Punishment is pronounced to be twofold:
corporal punishment and fines. Corporal punishment is again declared to
be of ten sorts; fines are (also) of more than one kind.

\* 54. <span id="fr_706"></span>[54](#fn_704.md) Fines begin with a
Kâka*n*î, and the highest amount of a fine is one's entire property.
Corporal punishment begins with confinement and ends with capital
punishment.

\* 55. 'Fines beginning with a Kâka*n*î' are declared to amount to no
less than one Mâsha. Those are called 'fines amounting to no less than a
Mâsha' which amount to one Kârshâpa*n*a at most.

\* 56. 'Fines beginning with no less than a Kârshâpa*n*a' are those
amounting to no less than four Kârshâpa*n*as; or which begin with two,
and end with eight (Kârshâpa*n*as); or which begin with three, and end
with twelve (Kârshâpa*n*as).

\* 57. <span id="fr_707"></span>[57](#fn_706.md) A Kârshâpa*n*a is a silver
coin in the southern country; in the east, it is an equivalent for (a
certain number of) Pa*n*as, and is equal to twenty Pa*n*as.

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

\* 58. A Mâsha should be known to be the twentieth part of a
Kârshâpa*n*a. A Kâka*n*î is the fourth part of a Mâsha or Pala.

59. <span id="fr_708"></span>[59](#fn_707.md) By that appellation which is
in general use in the region of the Punjaub, the value of a Kârshâpa*n*a
is not circumscribed here.

\* 60. <span id="fr_709"></span>[60](#fn_708.md) A Kârshâpa*n*a has to be
taken as equal to an A*nd*ikâ; four of these are a Dhânaka; twelve of
the latter are a Suvar*n*a, which is called Dînâra otherwise.

61\. Let the king practise the duties of his office, and (follow) the
rule of inflicting punishment, faithful to the tenets (of the sacred
law). Let him destroy accordingly, as governor, the evil-doers, after
having traced them by the application of cunning stratagems and arrested
them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_672"></span>[223:1](sbe3350.htm#fr_673.md) This section is
found in the Nepalese MS. only. See Introduction. The reading of several
passages is uncertain, and this circumstance, taken together with the
want of a Commentary, renders my translation less reliable than could be
desired.

Appendix. Theft. 1-4. Manu IX, 256-260. The technical terms have been
translated in accordance with the glosses of Alarm's commentators, as
given in the notes to Professor Miler's translation. In par. 4,
mushyâ*m* seems to stand for mush*t*ya*m*.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[224:9](sbe3350.htm#fr_674.md) 'Antithetically'
(vinigrahe), or 'when they have been arrested.'

<span id="fn_674"></span>[224:10](sbe3350.htm#fr_675.md) 10, 11. A somewhat
analogous description of the signs by which a false witness may be found
out, has been given previously: I, 193-196.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[225:12](sbe3350.htm#fr_676.md) The term le*s*a
has been rendered by 'circumstantial evidence,' because it seems to be
synonymous with yuktile*s*a, I, 236.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[225:13](sbe3350.htm#fr_677.md) 13, 14. Manu IX,
271, 278.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[225:15](sbe3350.htm#fr_678.md) Nearly identical
with Manu IX, 272.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[225:16](sbe3350.htm#fr_679.md) The term go*k*ara,
translated 'ground,' may denote the landed property or pasture ground of
a whole village. See above, XIV, 22, 23.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[225:17](sbe3350.htm#fr_680.md) See XIV, 24.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[226:19](sbe3350.htm#fr_681.md) The senseless
reading of the MS., dâpyaka teshâm, has been conjecturally altered into
doshakartaisha.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[226:22](sbe3350.htm#fr_682.md) 22-24. Manu VIII,
326-329.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[226:25](sbe3350.htm#fr_683.md) Manu VIII, 321.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[227:26](sbe3350.htm#fr_684.md) Manu VIII, 320.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[227:27](sbe3350.htm#fr_685.md) 27, 28. Manu VIII,
321, 323.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[227:29](sbe3350.htm#fr_686.md) Manu VIII, 325.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[227:30](sbe3350.htm#fr_687.md) 30, 37. The
reading of these two paragraphs is quite uncertain. The rules laid down
here apparently differ considerably from the analogous rules of Manu
(VIII, 758) and other legislators.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[228:32](sbe3350.htm#fr_688.md) Manu IX, 277.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[228:33](sbe3350.htm#fr_689.md) The parallel
passage of Manu (VIII, 325) shows that sthûrâyâ*s* *kh*edana*m* is the
correct reading. For the three different explanations of this term,
which have been proposed by the commentators of Manu, see the note to
Professor Bühler's translation. The translation follows the
interpretation proposed by Kullûka, Govindarâ*g*a, and Râghavânanda,
which appears to be preferable to the others.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[228:34](sbe3350.htm#fr_690.md) Nearly identical
with Manu VIII, 334.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[228:36](sbe3350.htm#fr_691.md) 36, 37. Nearly
identical with Manu VIII, 124, 125.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[229:38](sbe3350.htm#fr_692.md) Manu VIII, 126.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[229:39](sbe3350.htm#fr_693.md) Manu VIII, 347.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[229:40](sbe3350.htm#fr_694.md) Nearly identical
with Manu IX, 249.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[229:41](sbe3350.htm#fr_695.md) Manu VIII, 380.

<span id="fn_695"></span>[229:42](sbe3350.htm#fr_696.md) The third Pâda of
this paragraph has been conjecturally altered, as it cannot be made out
in the MS.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[229:43](sbe3350.htm#fr_697.md) Manu IX, 236.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[229:44](sbe3350.htm#fr_698.md) 44, 45. Manu IX,
237. The last Pâda in paragraph 44 cannot be made out in the MS.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[230:46](sbe3350.htm#fr_699.md) Nearly identical
with Manu VIII, 314.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[230:48](sbe3350.htm#fr_700.md) Identical with
Manu VIII, 318.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[230:49](sbe3350.htm#fr_701.md) Nearly identical
with Manu VIII, 316.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[230:51](sbe3350.htm#fr_702.md) Nearly identical
with Manu VIII, 337.

<span id="fn_702"></span>[231:52](sbe3350.htm#fr_703.md) Manu VIII, 338.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[231:53](sbe3350.htm#fr_704.md) Manu VIII, 129.
See too, above, paragraphs 36, 37.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[231:54](sbe3350.htm#fr_706.md) Kâka*n*î or
Kâki*n*î is the name of a small coin. See par. 58.

<span id="fn_705"></span>[231:56](sbe3350.htm#fr_705.md) 53-56. This
passage is quoted, in the Sm*ri*ti*k*andrikâ, with several different
readings. One of them, in par. 55, deserves special notice. For
mâshâvara*h* smata*h* (read sm*ri*ta*h*), the Sm*ri*ti*k*. reads
mâshapara*h* sm*ri*ta*h*, 'are declared to amount to no more than one
Mâsha.' This is probably the correct reading.

<span id="fn_706"></span>[231:57](sbe3350.htm#fr_707.md) According to Manu
(VIII, 136), the Kârshâpa*n*a is a copper coin. The reading of the
second half of this paragraph is quite uncertain.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[232:59](sbe3350.htm#fr_708.md) The term iha,
'here,' may be either referred to the place of residence of the author
of the Nârada-sm*ri*ti, or it may mean 'in this work.'

<span id="fn_708"></span>[232:60](sbe3350.htm#fr_709.md) An A*nd*ikâ is
elsewhere reckoned at four Yavas. In the Vîramitrodaya and other works,
this text is attributed to B*ri*haspati. The coin called Dînâra is the
Roman denarius.
