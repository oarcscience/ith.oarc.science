#### 18. What has to be done in default of both Witnesses and Documents.

\* 235. When, owing to the negligence of the creditor, both a written
contract and witnesses are missing, and the opponent denies his
obligation, three different methods may be adopted.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

\* 236. <span id="fr_282"></span>[236](#fn_282.md) A timely reminder,
argument, and, thirdly, an oath, these are the measures which a
plaintiff should adopt against his adversary.

\* 237. <span id="fr_283"></span>[237](#fn_283.md) He who does not refute
his (adversary's) statements, though he has been reminded again and
again, three, or four, or five times, may be compelled to pay the debt
in consequence.

\* 238. <span id="fr_284"></span>[238](#fn_284.md) If the defendant has
rejected a demand (to pay), he shall aggress him with arguments relative
to place, time, matter, the connexions (existing between the two
parties), the amount (of the debt), the contents (of the written
contract), and so forth.

\* 239. <span id="fr_285"></span>[239](#fn_285.md) If arguments also are of
no avail, let him cause the defendant to undergo one of the ordeals, by
fire, water, proof of virtue, and so forth, (which may seem) appropriate
to the place, to the season, and to the strength (of the defendant).

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

240. <span id="fr_286"></span>[240](#fn_286.md) He whom the waters keep
below the surface, and whom blazing fire does not burn, is considered to
refute the charge. In the opposite case he is deemed guilty.

\* 241. Proof by ordeal takes place (if an offence has been committed)
in a solitary forest, at night, in the interior of a house, and in the
case of a heinous offence, or denial of a deposit.

\* 242. <span id="fr_287"></span>[242](#fn_287) (Ordeals.md) are equally
(applicable) in the case of those women, whose morality has been
impeached, in cases of theft and robbery, and in all cases of denial of
an obligation.

\* 243. <span id="fr_288"></span>[243](#fn_288.md) Of the gods and *Ri*shis
even, the taking of oaths is recorded. Vasish*th*a took an oath when he
was accused of having assumed the shape of an evil spirit.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

\* 244. <span id="fr_289"></span>[244](#fn_289.md) The seven *Ri*shis
resolutely took an oath together with Indra in order to clear themselves
mutually of suspicion, when each was suspected (by the rest) of having
taken lotus fibres.

245. <span id="fr_290"></span>[245](#fn_290.md) The perpetrator of a wrong
action, or of a crime, shall be let off with one half of the punishment
due to his offence, if he admits the charge or if he makes his guilt
known of his own accord.

246. <span id="fr_291"></span>[246](#fn_291.md) If, on the other hand, a
criminal has cunningly concealed his crime, and is convicted of it, the
members of the court of justice will not be satisfied with his conduct,
and the punishment inflicted on him shall be specially heavy.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_282"></span>[97:236](sbe3325.htm#fr_282.md) 'A timely
reminder,' timely appeals to the debtor and to the witnesses who have
attested the loan. 'Argument,' arguing that the sum in dispute has been
previously repaid, or the obligation acknowledged by the debtor.
Thirdly, he may attack the defendant with an oath or ordeal, such as
e.g. by causing him to swear by his own good actions, or to undergo the
ordeal of sacred libation, &c. A. The term 'a reminder' is not correctly
explained by Asahâya, as the rule under notice refers to those cases
where witnesses are missing.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[97:237](sbe3325.htm#fr_283.md) If a debtor has
again and again been addressed by his creditor, saying, 'Thou owest me
money,' and the debtor does not deny the correctness of the assertion,
he shall be bound to pay the debt. Raghunandana's Vyavahâratattva.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[97:238](sbe3325.htm#fr_284.md) Asahâya says that
the various arguments mentioned in this verse shall be resorted to
successively, arguments relative to time having to be proffered when
arguments relative to place have failed, and so on.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[97:239](sbe3325.htm#fr_285.md) The term *s*apatha
denotes both an ordeal and an oath in this place, though some of the
commentators deny that *s*apatha may have the former meaning.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[98:240](sbe3325.htm#fr_286.md) If a man who is
performing the ordeal by water does not rise from water, and if blazing
fire, which he is holding in his hand, does not burn him, he is freed
from the charge, otherwise he is deemed guilty, i.e. criminal. A. Manu
VIII, 115. It does not become quite clear whether the divine tests
referred to in this paragraph are identical with the ordeals by water
and fire as described further on. See the translations of Manu, and
Professor Stenzler's and Dr. E. Schlagintweit's papers on Ordeals in
Ancient India.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[98:242](sbe3325.htm#fr_287.md) Where the conduct
of a woman, i.e. her morals, is called into doubt; where theft or
robbery is alleged to have been committed; and where anything has been
declared false, for all heavy charges in short, this rule regarding the
performance of ordeals has been laid down. A.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[98:243](sbe3325.htm#fr_288.md) 243, 244. Manu
VIII, 110.

243\. The great sage Vasish*th*a, being suspected of being an evil
spirit, took an oath, and was cleared of suspicion thus. A. The story,
to which allusion is made in this place, is told by the commentators of
the code of Manu. Vi*s*vâmitra accused his rival Vasish*th*a before King
Sudâs as having eaten up his hundred sons, in the shape of a Râkshasa
(malignant spirit). Vasish*th*a thereupon exclaimed, 'I will fall dead
on the spot if I am a Râkshasa.'

<span id="fn_289"></span>[99:244](sbe3325.htm#fr_289.md) The story here
referred to occurs in the Purâ*n*as. The meaning is this: If the great
sages even have taken oaths in order to clear themselves from suspicion,
how much less should ordinary mortals refrain from taking an oath. A.
According to Medhâtithi and Govindarâ*g*a, the two earliest commentators
of Manu, the seven *Ri*shis had mutually accused one another of the
theft of lotus fibres. Indra took an oath when he was suspected with
Ahalyâ.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[99:245](sbe3325.htm#fr_290.md) One who has
committed any wrong or sinful act to the detriment of any one
whomsoever, or who has become guilty of robbery or other crimes, shall
have to suffer one half only of the punishment ordained for his
misconduct, if he acknowledges in a court of law the truth of the charge
brought against himself by the injured party. The same rule obtains, if
he has denounced himself guilty; though no plaint has been lodged
against him. A.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[99:246](sbe3325.htm#fr_291.md) If the perpetrator
of a wrong act, or of robbery, &c., denies his guilt, on being examined
in a court of justice, and is convicted afterwards by means of an ordeal
or of another mode of proof, the assessors of the court will be incensed
against and a heavy punishment inflicted on him, as e.g. he will have to
pay twice as much as in ordinary cases. Here ends that section of the
law of debt which consists of 'Rules for those cases where both
documents and witnesses are wanting.' A.
