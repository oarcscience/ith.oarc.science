### SECTION XXXIV

"Sauti said, 'Hearing this story of the re-appearance and departure of
his forefathers, king Janamejaya of great intelligence became highly
pleased. Filled with joy, he once more questioned Vaisampayana on the
subject of the reappearance of dead men, saying,--"How is it possible
for persons whose bodies have been destroyed to re-appear in those very
forms?" Thus asked, that foremost of regenerate persons, *viz.*, the
disciple of Vyasa, that first of speakers, possessed of great energy,
thus answered Janamejaya.

"Vaisampayana said, 'This is certain, *viz.*, that acts are never
destroyed (without their consequences being enjoyed or endured). Bodies,
O king, are born of acts; so also are features. The great primal
elements are eternal (indestructible) in consequence of the union with
them of the Lord of all beings. They exist with what is eternal.
Accordingly, they have no destruction when the non-eternal are
destroyed. Acts done without exertion are true and foremost, and bear
real fruit. The soul, united however with such acts as require exertion
for their accomplishment, enjoys pleasure and pain. <span
id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) Though united so (that is, with pleasure
and pain), yet it is a certain inference that the soul is never modified
by them, like the reflection of creatures in a mirror. It is never
destroyed. <span id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_50.md) As long as one's acts are
not exhausted (by enjoyment

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

or endurance of their fruits good and bad), so long does one regard the
body to be oneself. The man, however, whose acts have been exhausted,
without regarding the body to be self, takes the self to be something
otherwise. <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md) Diverse existent objects
(such as the primal elements and the senses, etc.) attaining to a body,
become united as one. To men of knowledge who understand the difference
(between the body and self), those very objects become eternal. <span
id="fr_52"></span>[2](#fn_52.md) In the Horse-sacrifice, this Sruti is
heard in the matter of the slaying of the horse. Those which are the
certain possessions of embodied creatures, *viz.*, their life-breaths
(and the senses, etc.), exist eternally even when they are borne to the
other world. I shall tell thee what is beneficial, if it be agreeable to
thee, O king. Thou hast, while employed in thy sacrifices, heard of the
paths of the deities. When preparations were made for any sacrifice of
thine, the deities became beneficially inclined to thee. When indeed,
the deities were thus disposed and came to thy sacrifices, they were
lords in the matter of the passage (from this to the next world) of the
animals slain. <span id="fr_53"></span>[3](#fn_53.md) For this reason, the
eternal ones (*viz.*, Jivas), by adoring the deities in sacrifices,
succeed in attaining to excellent goals. When the five primal elements
are eternal, when the soul also is eternal, he called *Purusha* (*viz.*,
the soul invested with case) is equally so. When such is the case, he
who beholds a creature as disposed to take diverse forms, is regarded as
having an erroneous understanding. He who indulges in too much grief at
separation is, I think, a foolish person. He who sees evil in separation
should abandon union. By standing aloof, no unions are formed, and
sorrow is cast off, for sorrow in the world is born of separation. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[4](#fn_54.md) Only he who understands the distinction
between body and self, and not another, becomes freed from the erroneous
conviction. He that knows the other (*viz.*, self) attains to the
highest understanding and becomes freed from error. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[5](#fn_55.md) As regards creatures. they appear from an
invisible state, and once more disappear into invisibleness. I do not
know him. He also does not know me. As regards myself, renunciation is
not yet mine. <span id="fr_56"></span>[6](#fn_56.md) He

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

that is not possessed of puissance enjoys or endures the fruits of all
his acts in those too dies in which he does them. If the act be a mental
one, its consequences are enjoyed or endured mentally; if it be done
with the body, its consequences are to be enjoyed or endured in the
body.'" <span id="fr_57"></span>[1](m15035.htm#fn_57.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_49"></span>[52:1](m15034.htm#fr_49.md) Nilakantha explains
that *anayasakritani karma* implies the religion of *Nivritti*, for the
religion of *Pravritti* consists of acts that require *ayasa* or
exertion for their accomplishment. The religion of Nivritti or
abstention from acts is said hereto be true and superior, and productive
of real fruit, in the form, that is, of Emancipation. The soul, however,
in the generality of cases, united with *ebhih*, by which is meant
*ayasa-kritam karma*, that is, the acts done in pursuance of the
religion of Pravritti, becomes embodied and, therefore, enjoys happiness
or endures misery as the case may be.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[52:2](m15034.htm#fr_50.md) The sense seems to be
this--when a creature stands before a mirror, its image is formed in the
mirror; such reflection, however, never affects the mirror in the least,
for when the object leaves the vicinity of the mirror, the image or
reflection vanishes away. The soul is like the mirror. Pleasure and pain
are like reflections in it. They come and go away without the soul being
at all modified by them in anyway. Pleasure and pain are destructible,
but not so the soul.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[53:1](m15034.htm#fr_51.md) The ordinary man thinks
this conglomeration of diverse objects to be his self. The man of wisdom
who has exhausted his acts does not think so. He is freed from the
obligation of taking a body.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[53:2](m15034.htm#fr_52.md) The sense probably is
this. En the case of ordinary men, the component parts of the body
dissolve away, while Yogins can keep such parts from dissolution as long
as they like.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[53:3](m15034.htm#fr_53.md) The sense is, the
deities bear away to the next world the animals slain in sacrifices
Through the bodies of such animals are apparently destroyed, yet their
life-breaths and senses continue to exist.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[53:4](m15034.htm#fr_54.md) The sense is that as
wives etc., when lost, are sources of sorrow, wise men should abstain
from contracting such relations. They might then be free from sorrow.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[53:5](m15034.htm#fr_55.md) *Paraparajnah* is one
that understands the distinction between body and sell. *Apara* is,
therefore, one that is not possessed of such knowledge; hence, as
Nilakantha explains, it implies one who has not attained to *Jnana
nishtha*. What is said in the second line is that he that adores *saguna
Brahma*, succeeds afterwards, through such adoration, in reaching to
*nirguna Brahma*.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[53:6](m15034.htm#fr_56.md) The sense seems to be
this: we spring from the unmanifest and disappear once more in the
unmanifest. The Bengal texts read the first line incorrectly. It is
*adarsanalapatitah*. The second line is unintelligible. *Naham tam
vedini* is taken by Nilakantha as implying 'I do not know him,' *i.e.*,
him that is Emancipate. Asau cha no vetti mam is explained as a due to
*karanabhat*. <span id="page_54">p. 54</span> But who is *asau*? 'I have
no renunciation,' or 'renunciation is not yet mine,' implies that
Emancipation, which directly flows from renunciation, is not mine.
