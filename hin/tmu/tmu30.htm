<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Om</span>. The great muni Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya went to A&#7693;i&#7789;yaloka (the sun's world) and saluting him (the Purusha of the sun) said: "O reverend sir, describe to me the &#256;&#7789;m&#257;-&#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;va (the &#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;va or truth of &#256;&#7789;m&#257;)."</p>  
<p>(To which,) N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a (<i>viz</i>., the Purusha of the sun) replied: "I shall describe the eightfold yoga together with J&ntilde;&#257;na. The conquering of cold and heat as well as hunger and sleep, the preserving of (sweet) patience and unruffledness ever and the restraining of the organs (from sensual objects)&#8212;all these come under (or are) yama. Devotion to one's guru, love of the true path, enjoyment of objects producing happiness, internal satisfaction, freedom from association, living in a retired place, the controlling of the manas and the not longing after the fruits of actions and a state of vair&#257;gya&#8212;all these <A HREF="errata.htm#17">constitute</A> niyama. The sitting in any posture pleasant to one and clothed in tatters (or bark) is prescribed for &#257;sana (posture). Inspiration, restraint of breath and expiration, which have respectively 16, 64 and 32 (m&#257;&#7789;r&#257;s) constitute pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma (restraint of breath). The restraining of the mind from the objects of</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></A></p>  
<p>senses is pra&#7789;y&#257;h&#257;ra (subjugation of the senses). The contemplation of the oneness of consciousness in all objects is &#7693;hy&#257;na. The mind having been drawn away from the objects of the senses, the fixing of the chai&#7789;anya (consciousness) (on one alone) is &#7693;h&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;. The forgetting of oneself in &#7693;hy&#257;na is sam&#257;&#7693;hi. He who thus knows the eight subtle parts of yoga attains salvation.</p>  
<p>"The body has five stains (<i>viz</i>.,) passion, anger, out-breathing, fear, and sleep. The removal of these can be effected respectively by absence of sa&#7749;kalpa, forgiveness, moderate food, carefulness, and a spiritual sight of &#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;vas. In order to cross the ocean of sams&#257;ra where sleep and fear are the serpents, injury, etc., are the waves, &#7789;&#7771;sh&#7751;&#257; (thirst) is the whirlpool, and wife is the mire, one should adhere to the subtle path and overstepping &#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;va&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and other gu&#7751;as should look out for &#7788;&#257;raka.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> &#7788;&#257;raka is Brahman which being in the middle of the two eyebrows, is of the nature of the spiritual <A HREF="errata.htm#18">effulgence</A> of Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a. The (spiritual) seeing through the three lakshyas (or the three kinds of introvision) is the means to It (Brahman). Sushumn&#257; which is from the m&#363;l&#257;&#7693;h&#257;ra to brahmaran&#7693;hra has the radiance of the sun. In the centre of it, is kun&#7693;alin&#299; shining like crores of lightning and subtle as the thread in the lotus-stalk. &#7788;amas is destroyed there. Through seeing it, all sins are destroyed. When the two ears are closed by the tips of the forefingers, a ph&#363;&#7789;k&#257;ra (or booming) sound is heard. When the mind is fixed on it, it sees a blue light between the eyes as also in the heart. (This is an&#7789;arlakshya or internal <A HREF="errata.htm#19">introvision</A>). In the bahirlakshya (or external introvision) one sees in order before his nose at distance of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 digits, the space of blue colour, then a colour resembling &#347;y&#257;ma (indigo-black) and then shining as rak&#7789;a (red) wave and then with the two p&#299;&#7789;a (yellow and orange red) colours. Then he is a yogin. When one looks at the external space, moving</p>

<p>the eyes and sees streaks of light at the corners of his eyes, then his vision can be made steady. When one sees jyo&#7789;is (spiritual light) above his head 12 digits in length, then he attains the state of nectar. In the ma&#7693;hyalakshya (or the middle one), one sees the variegated colours of the morning as if the sun, the moon and the fire had joined together in the &#257;k&#257;&#347; that is without them. Then he comes to have their nature (of light). Through practice, he becomes one with &#257;k&#257;&#347;, devoid of all gu&#7751;as and peculiarities. At first &#257;k&#257;&#347; with its shining stars becomes to him Para-&#257;k&#257;&#347; as dark as &#7789;amas itself, and he becomes one with Para-&#257;k&#257;&#347; shining with stars and deep as &#7789;amas. (Then) he becomes one with Mah&#257;-&#257;k&#257;&#347; resplendent (as) with the fire of the deluge. Then he becomes one with &#7788;a&#7789;&#7789;va-&#257;k&#257;&#347;, lighted with the brightness which is the highest and the best of all. Then he becomes one with S&#363;rya-&#257;k&#257;&#347; (sun-&#257;k&#257;&#347;) brightened by a crore of suns. By practising thus, he becomes one with them. He who knows them becomes thus.</p>  
<p>"Know that yoga is twofold through its division into the p&#363;rva (earlier) and the u&#7789;&#7789;ara (later). The earlier is &#7789;&#257;raka and the later is amanaska (the mindless). &#7788;&#257;raka is divided into m&#363;r&#7789;i (with limitation) and am&#363;r&#7789;i (without limitation). That is m&#363;r&#7789;i &#7789;&#257;raka which goes to the end of the senses (or exists till the senses are conquered). That is am&#363;r&#7789;i &#7789;&#257;raka which goes beyond the two eyebrows (above the senses). Both these should be performed through manas. An&#7789;ar&#7693;&#7771;shti (internal vision) associated with manas comes to aid &#7789;&#257;raka. &#7788;ejas (spiritual light) appears in the hole between the two eyebrows. This &#7789;&#257;raka is the earlier one. The later is amanaska. The great jyo&#7789;is (light)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_228"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is above the root of the palate. By seeing it, one gets the si&#7693;&#7693;his a&#7751;im&#257;, etc. &#346;&#257;mbhav&#299;mu&#7693;r&#257; occurs when the lakshya (spiritual vision) is internal while the (physical) eyes are seeing externally without winking. This is the great science which is concealed in all the tan&#7789;ras. When this is known, one does not stay in sams&#257;ra. Its worship (or practice) gives salvation. An&#7789;arlakshya is of</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="green">p. 246</font></A></p>  
<p>the nature of Jalajyo&#7789;is (or waterjyotis). It is known by the great &#7770;shis and is invisible both to the internal and external senses.</p>  
<p>"Sahasr&#257;ra (<i>viz</i>., the thousand-petalled lotus of the pineal gland) Jalajyo&#7789;is&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_229"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is the an&#7789;arlakshya. Some say the form of Purusha in the cave of bu&#7693;&#7693;hi beautiful in all its parts is an&#7789;arlakshya. Some again say that the all-quiescent N&#299;laka&#7751;tha accompanied by Um&#257; (his wife) and having five mouths and latent in the midst of the sphere in the brain is an&#7789;arlakshya. Whilst others say that the Purusha of the dimension of a thumb is an&#7789;arlakshya. A few again say an&#7789;arlakshya is the One Self made supreme through introvision in the state of a j&#299;vanmuk&#7789;a. All the different statements above made pertain to &#256;&#7789;m&#257; alone. He alone is a Brahmanishtha who sees that the above lakshya is the pure &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. The j&#299;va which is the twenty-fifth &#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;va, having abandoned the twenty-four &#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;vas, becomes a j&#299;vanmuk&#7789;a through the conviction that the twenty-sixth &#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;va (<i>viz</i>.,) Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257; is 'I' alone. Becoming one with an&#7789;arlakshya (Brahman) in the emancipated state by means of an&#7789;arlakshya (introvision), j&#299;va becomes one with the partless sphere of Param&#257;k&#257;&#347;.</p>  
<p>"Thus ends the first Br&#257;hma&#7751;a."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> II</h5>  
<p>Then Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya asked the Purusha in the sphere of the sun: "O Lord, an&#7789;arlakshya has been described many times, but it has never been understood by me (clearly). Pray describe it to me." He replied: "It is the source of the five elements, has the lustre of many (streaks of) lightning, and has four seats having (or rising from) 'That' (Brahman). In its midst, there arises the manifestation of &#7789;a&#7789;&#7789;va. It is very hidden and unmanifested. It can be known (only) by one who has got into the boat of j&ntilde;&#257;na. It is the object of both bahir and an&#7789;ar (external and internal) lakshyas. In its midst is absorbed</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="green">p. 247</font></A></p>  
<p>the whole world. It is the vast partless universe beyond N&#257;&#7693;a, Bin&#7693;u and Kara. Above it (<i>viz</i>., the sphere of agni) is the sphere of the sun; in its midst is the sphere of the nectary moon; in its midst is the sphere of the partless Brahma-&#7789;ejas (or the spiritual effulgence of Brahman). It has the brightness of &#346;ukla (white light)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> like the ray of lightning. It alone has the characteristic of &#346;&#257;mbhav&#299;. In seeing this, there are three kinds of &#7693;&#7771;shti (sight), <i>viz</i>., am&#257; (the new moon), pra&#7789;ipa&#7789; (the first day of lunar fortnight), and p&#363;r&#7751;im&#257; (the full moon). The sight of am&#257; is the one (seen) with closed eyes. That with half opened eyes is pra&#7789;ipa&#7789;; while that with fully opened eyes is p&#363;r&#7751;im&#257;. Of these, the practice of p&#363;r&#7751;im&#257; should be resorted to. Its lakshya (or aim) is the tip of the nose. Then is seen a deep darkness at the root of the palate. By practising thus, a jyo&#7789;is (light) of the form of an endless sphere is seen. This alone is Brahman, the Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a. When the mind is absorbed in bliss thus naturally produced, then does &#346;&#257;mbhav&#299; take place. She (&#346;&#257;mbhav&#299;) alone is called Khechar&#299;. By practising it (<i>viz</i>., the mu&#7693;r&#257;), a man obtains firmness of mind. Through it, he obtains firmness of v&#257;yu. The following are the signs: first it is seen like a star; then a reflecting (or dazzling) diamond;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> then the sphere of full moon; then the sphere of the brightness of nine gems; then the sphere of the midday sun; then the sphere of the flame of agni (fire); all these are seen in order.</p>  
<p>"(Thus much for the light in p&#363;rva or first stage.) Then there is the light in the western direction (in the u&#7789;&#7789;ara or second stage). Then the lustres of crystal, smoke, bin&#7693;u, n&#257;&#7693;a, kal&#257;, star, firefly, lamp, eye, gold, and nine gems, etc. are seen. This alone is the form of Pra&#7751;ava. Having united Pr&#257;&#7751;a and Ap&#257;na and holding the breath in kumbhaka, one should fix his concentration at the tip of his nose and making sha&#7751;mukhi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with the fingers of both his hands, one hears</p>

<p><a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="green">p. 248</font></A></p>  
<p>the sound of Pra&#7751;ava (Om) in which manas becomes absorbed. Such a man has not even the touch of karma. The karma of (San&#7693;hy&#257;van&#7693;ana or the daily prayers) is verily performed at the rising or setting of the sun. As there is no rising or setting (but only the ever shining) of the sun of Chi&#7789; (the higher consciousness) in the heart of a man who knows thus, he has no karma to perform. Rising above (the conception of) day and night through the annihilation of sound and time, he becomes one with Brahman through the all-full j&ntilde;&#257;na and the attaining of the state of unman&#299; (the state above manas). Through the state of unman&#299;, he becomes amanaska (or without manas).</p>  
<p>"Not being troubled by any thoughts (of the world) then constitutes the &#7693;hy&#257;na.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The abandoning of all karmas constitutes &#257;v&#257;hana (invocation of god). Being firm in the unshaken (spiritual) wisdom constitutes &#257;sana (posture). Being in the state of unman&#299; constitutes the p&#257;&#7693;ya (offering of water for washing the feet of god). Preserving the state of amanaska (when manas is offered as sacrifice) constitutes the arghya (offering of water as oblation generally). Being in state of eternal brightness and shoreless nectar constitutes sn&#257;na (bathing). The contemplation of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as present in all constitutes (the application to the idol of) sandal. The remaining in the real state of the &#7693;&#7771;k (spiritual eye) is (the worshipping with) aksha&#7789;a;(non-broken rice). The attaining of Chi&#7789; (consciousness) is (the worshipping with) flower. The real state of agni (fire) of Chi&#7789; is the &#7693;h&#363;pa (burning of incense). The state of the sun of Chi&#7789; is the &#7693;&#299;pa (light waved before the image). The union of oneself with the nectar of full moon is the naiv&#275;&#7693;ya (offering of food, etc.).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The immobility in that state (of the ego being one with all) is pra&#7693;akshi&#7751;a (going round the image). The conception of 'I am He' is namask&#257;ra (prostration). The silence (then) is the s&#7789;u&#7789;i (praise). The all-contentment (or serenity then) is the visarjana (giving leave to god or finishing worship). (This is</p>

<p><a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="green">p. 249</font></A></p>  
<p>the worship of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; by all Raja-yogins). He who knows this knows all.</p>  
<p>"When the &#7789;riputi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are thus dispelled, he becomes the kaivalya jyo&#7789;is without bh&#257;va (existence) or abh&#257;va (nonexistence), full and motionless, like the ocean without the tides or like the lamp without the wind. He becomes a brahmavi&#7789; (knower of Brahman) by cognising the end of the sleeping state, even while in the waking state. Though the (same) mind is absorbed in sushup&#7789;i as also in sam&#257;&#7693;hi, there is much difference between them. (In the former case) as the mind is absorbed in &#7789;amas, it does not become the means of salvation, (but) in sam&#257;&#7693;hi as the modifications of &#7789;amas in him are rooted away, the mind raises itself to the nature of the Partless. All that is no other than S&#257;kshi-Chai&#7789;anya (witness-consciousness or the Higher Self) into which the absorption of the whole universe takes place, inasmuch as the universe is but a delusion (or creation) of the mind and is therefore not different from it. Though the universe appears perhaps as outside of the mind, still it is unreal. He who knows Brahman and who is the sole enjoyer of br&#257;hmic bliss which is eternal and has dawned once (for all in him)&#8212;that man becomes one with Brahman. He in whom sa&#7749;kalpa perishes has got muk&#7789;i in his hand. Therefore one becomes an emancipated person through the contemplation of Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;. Having given up both bh&#257;va and abh&#257;va, one becomes a j&#299;vanmuk&#7789;a by leaving off again and again in all states j&ntilde;&#257;na (wisdom) and j&ntilde;eya (object of wisdom), &#7693;hy&#257;na (meditation) and &#7693;hyeya (object of meditation), lakshya (the aim) and alakshya (non-aim), &#7693;&#7771;&#347;ya (the visible) and a&#7693;&#7771;&#347;ya (the non-visible and &#363;ha (reasoning) and apoha (negative reasoning).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> He who knows this knows all.</p>  
<p>"There are five avas&#7789;h&#257;s (states), <i>viz</i>.: j&#257;gra&#7789; (waking), svapna (dreaming), sushup&#7789;i (dreamless sleeping), the &#7789;urya (fourth) and tury&#257;&#7789;&#299;&#7789;a (that beyond the fourth). The j&#299;va (ego) that is engaged in the waking state becomes attached to the prav&#7771;&#7789;&#7789;i (worldly) path and is the participator of naraka (hell) as the</p>

<p>fruit of sins. He desires svarga (heaven) as the fruit of his virtuous actions. This very same person becomes (afterwards) indifferent to all these saying, "Enough of the births tending to actions, the fruits of which tend to bondage till the end of this mundane existence." Then he pursues the niv&#7771;&#7789;&#7789;i (return) path with a view to attain emancipation. And this person then takes refuge in a spiritual instructor in order to cross this mundane existence. Giving up passion and others, he does only those he is asked to do. Then having acquired the four s&#257;&#7693;hanas (means to salvation), he attains, in the middle of the lotus of his heart, the Reality of an&#7789;arlakshya that is but the Sa&#7789; of Lord and begins to recognise (or recollect) the bliss of Brahman which he had left (or enjoyed) in his sushup&#7789;i state. At last he attains this state of discrimination (thus): 'I think I am the non-dual One only. I was in aj&ntilde;&#257;na for some time (in the waking state and called therefore Vi&#347;va). I became somehow (or involuntarily) a &#7788;aijasa (in the dreaming state) through the reflection (in that state) of the affinities of the forgotten waking state; and now I am a Pr&#257;j&ntilde;a through the disappearance of those two states. Therefore I am one only. I (appear) as more than one through the differences of state and place. And there is nothing of differentiation of class besides me.' Having expelled even the smack of the difference (of conception) between 'I' and 'That' through the thought 'I am the pure and the secondless Brahman', and having attained the path of salvation which is of the nature of Parabrahman, after having become one with It through the &#7693;hy&#257;na of the sun's sphere as shining with himself, he becomes fully ripened for getting salvation. Sa&#7749;kalpa and others are the causes of the bondage of the mind; and the mind devoid of these becomes fit for salvation. Possessing such a mind free from all (sa&#7749;kalpa, etc.,) and withdrawing himself from the outer world of sight and others and so keeping himself out of the odour of the universe, he looks upon all the world as &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, abandons the conception of 'I', thinks I am Brahman' and considers all these as &#256;&#7789;m&#257;. Through these, he becomes one who has done his duty.</p>

<p>"The yogin is one that has realised Brahman that is all-full beyond &#7789;urya. They (the people) extol him as Brahman; and becoming the object of the praise of the whole world, he wanders over different countries. Placing the bin&#7693;u in the &#257;k&#257;&#347; of Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257; and pursuing the path of the partless bliss produced by the pure, secondless, stainless, and innate yoga sleep of amanaska, he becomes an emancipated person. Then the yogin becomes immersed in the ocean of bliss. When compared to it, the bliss of In&#7693;ra and others is very little. He who gets this bliss is the supreme yogin.</p>  
<p>"Thus ends the second Br&#257;hma&#7751;a."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> III</h5>  
<p>The great sage Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya then asked the Purusha in the sphere (of the sun): "O Lord, though the nature of amanaska has been defined (by you), yet I forget it (or do not understand it clearly). Therefore pray explain it again to me." Accordingly the Purusha said: "This amanaska is a great secret. By knowing this, one becomes a person who has done his duty. One should look upon it as Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;, associated with &#346;&#257;mbhav&#299;mu&#7693;r&#257; and should know also all those that can be known through a (thorough) cognition of them. Then seeing Parabrahman in his own &#256;&#7789;ma as the Lord of all, the immeasurable, the birthless, the auspicious, the supreme &#257;k&#257;&#347;, the supportless, the secondless the only goal of Brahma, Vish&#7751;u and Ru&#7693;ra and the cause of all and assuring himself that he who plays in the cave (of the heart) is such a one, he should raise himself above the dualities of existence and non-existence; and knowing the experience of the unman&#299; of his manas, he then attains the state of Parabrahman which is motionless as a lamp in a windless place, having reached the ocean of br&#257;hmic bliss by means of the river of amanaska-yoga through the destruction of all his senses. Then he resembles a dry tree. Having lost all (idea of) the universe through the disappearance of growth, sleep, disease, expiration and inspiration, his body being always steady, he comes to have a supreme quiescence, being devoid of the movements of</p>  
<p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="green">p. 252</font></A></p>  
<p>his manas and becomes absorbed in Param&#257;&#7789;ma. The destruction of manas takes place after the destruction of the collective senses, like the cow's udder (that shrivels up) after the milk has been drawn. It is this that is amanaska. By following this, one becomes always pure and becomes one that has done his duty, having been filled with the partless bliss by means of the path of &#7789;&#257;raka-yoga through the initiation into the sacred sentences 'I am Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;,' 'That art thou,' 'I am thou alone,' 'Thou art I alone,' etc.</p>  
<p>"When his manas is immersed in the &#257;k&#257;&#347; and he becomes all-full, and when he attains the unman&#299; state, having abandoned all his collective senses, he conquers all sorrows and impurities through the partless bliss, having attained the fruits of kaivalya, ripened through the collective merits gathered in all his previous lives and thinking always 'I am Brahman,' becomes one that has done his duty. 'I am thou alone. There is no difference between thee and me owing to the fullness of Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;.' Saying thus, he (the Purusha of the sun) embraced his pupil&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and made him understand it.</p>  
<p>"Thus ends the third Br&#257;hma&#7751;a."</p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> IV</h5>  
<p>Then Y&#257;j&ntilde;avalkya addressed the Purusha in the sphere (of the sun) thus: "Pray explain to me in detail the nature of the fivefold division of &#257;k&#257;&#347;." He replied: "There are five (<i>viz</i>.): &#257;k&#257;&#347;, par&#257;k&#257;&#347;, mah&#257;k&#257;&#347;, s&#363;ry&#257;k&#257;&#347;, and param&#257;k&#257;&#347;. That which is of the nature of darkness, both in and out is the first &#257;k&#257;&#347;. That which has the fire of the deluge, both in and out is truly mah&#257;k&#257;&#347;. That which has the brightness of the sun, both in and out is s&#363;ry&#257;k&#257;&#347;. That brightness which is indescribable, all-pervading and of the nature of unrivalled bliss is param&#257;k&#257;&#347;. By cognising these according to this description, one becomes of their nature. He is a yogin only in name, who does not cognise well the nine chakras, the six &#257;&#7693;h&#257;ras, the three lakshyas and the five &#257;k&#257;&#347;. Thus ends the fourth Br&#257;hma&#7751;a."</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="green">p. 253</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> V</h5>  
<p>"The manas influenced by worldly objects is liable to bondage; and that (manas) which is not so influenced by these is fit for salvation. Hence all the world becomes an object of chi&#7789;&#7789;a; whereas the same chi&#7789;&#7789;a when it is supportless and well-ripe in the state of unman&#299;, becomes worthy of laya (absorption in Brahman). This absorption you should learn from me who am the all-full. I alone am the cause of the absorption of manas. The manas is within the jyo&#7789;is (spiritual light) which again is latent in the spiritual sound which pertains to the an&#257;ha&#7789;a (heart) sound. That manas which is the agent of creation, preservation, and destruction of the three worlds&#8212;that same manas becomes absorbed in that which is the highest seat of Vish&#7751;u; through such an absorption, one gets the pure and secondless state, owing to the absence of difference then. This alone is the highest truth. He who knows this, will wander in the world like a lad or an idiot or a demon or a simpleton. By practising this amanaska, one is ever contented, his urine and f&aelig;ces become diminished, his food becomes lessened: he becomes strong in body and his limbs are free from disease and sleep. Then his breath and eyes being motionless, he realises Brahman and attains the nature of bliss.</p>  
<p>"That ascetic who is intent on drinking the nectar of Brahman produced by the long practice of this kind of sam&#257;&#7693;hi, becomes a paramahamsa (ascetic) or an ava&#7693;h&#363;&#7789;a (naked ascetic). By seeing him, all the world becomes pure, and even an illiterate person who serves him is freed from bondage. He (the ascetic) enables the members of his family for one hundred and one generations to cross the ocean of sams&#257;ra; and his mother, father, wife, and children&#8212;all these are similarly freed. Thus is the Upanisha&#7693;. Thus ends the fifth Br&#257;hma&#7751;a."</p>
