### KALISANṬĀRAṆA UPANISHAḌ <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_96.md)

### OF

### KṚSHṆA-YAJURVEḌA

<span class="smallcaps">At</span> the end of Ḍvāpara yuga, Nāraḍa <span
id="fr_98"></span>[2](#fn_97.md) went to Brahma and addressed him thus: "O
Lord, how shall I, roaming <span id="fr_99"></span>[3](#fn_98.md) over the
earth, be able to cross Kali?" To which Brahma thus replied: "Well
asked. Hearken to that which all Śruṭis (the Veḍas) keep secret and
hidden, through which one may cross the samsāra (mundane existence) of
Kali. He shakes off (the evil effects of) Kali through the mere uttering
of the name of the Lord Nārāyaṇa, who is the primeval Purusha." Again
Nāraḍa asked Brahma: "What is the name?" To which Hiraṇyagarbha (Brahma)
replied thus: (the words are:) "1. Harē, 2. Rāma, 3. Harē, 4. Rāma, 5.
Rāma, 6. Rāma, 7. Harē, 8. Harē; 9. Harē 10. Kṛshṇa, 11. Harē, 12.
Kṛshṇa, 13. Kṛshṇa, 14. Kṛshṇa 15. Harē, 16. Harē. These sixteen names
(words) are destructive of the evil effects of Kali. No better means
than this is to be seen in all the Veḍas. These (sixteen names) destroy
the āvaraṇa (or the centripetal force which produces the sense of
individuality) of jīva surrounded by the sixteen kalās (rays). Then like
the

sphere of the sun which shines fully after the clouds (screening it)
disperse, Parabrahman (alone) shines."

Nāraḍa asked: "O Lord, what are the rules to be observed with reference
to it?" To which Brahma replied that there were no rules for it. Whoever
in a pure or an impure state, utters these always, attains the same
world of, or proximity with, or the same form of, or absorption into
Brahma.

Whoever utters three and a half kotis <span
id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_99) (or thirty-five millions.md) times this
manṭra composed of sixteen names (or words) crosses the sin of the
murder of a Brāhmaṇa. He becomes purified from the sin of the theft of
gold. He becomes purified from the sin of cohabitation with a woman of
low caste. He is purified from the sins of wrong done to piṭṛs, ḍevas,
and men. Having given up all ḍharmas, he becomes freed at once from all
sins. He is at once released from all bondage. That he is at once
released from all bondage is the Upanishaḍ.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_96"></span>[130:1](tmu21.htm#fr_97.md) This Upanishaḍ treats
of the means of crossing Kali completely: Nāraḍa having asked the
question in Ḍvāpara yuga—the third of the four yugas.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[130:2](tmu21.htm#fr_98.md) Nāraḍa is called
Kali-Kāraka or the generator of kali or strife and discord. If Nāraḍa is
himself the strife-maker, why should he go to Brahma for the means of
crossing Kali? Nāraḍa being himself an adjuster of the laws of karma,
this Upanishaḍ gives the means of getting over strife, etc., in this
Kali-age when the whole of nature is thrown off its balance by the
depraved tendencies of men. The jive, has sixteen kalās, corresponding
to which sixteen manṭras or words are given.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[130:3](tmu21.htm#fr_99.md) The story is that he
was cursed by Ḍaksha to roam over the worlds with a lute in his hand
(*viz*., to adjust the laws of harmony).

<span id="fn_99"></span>[131:1](tmu21.htm#fr_100.md) This number can be
reached by uttering the manṭra completely within one year if uttered at
the rate of a lakh per day: and within ten years if uttered at the rate
of 10,000 per day; and within 100 years if uttered at the rate of 1,000
*per diem*.
