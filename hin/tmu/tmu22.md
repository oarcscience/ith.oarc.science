### BHIKSHUKA <span id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_100.md)-UPANISHAḌ

<span class="smallcaps">Among</span> bhikshus (religious mendicants) who
long for moksha (salvation), there are four <span
id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_101.md) kinds, *viz*., Kutīchaka, Bahūḍaka,
Hamsa, and Paramahamsa. Gauṭama, Bhāraḍvāja, Yājñavalkya, Vasishtha and
others belong to the first kind. They take eight mouthfuls (of food
daily) and strive after moksha alone through the path of yoga. The
second kind carry three (bamboo) staves (tied together) and a waterpot,
and wear tuft of hair (śikhā), sacred thread (yajñopavīṭa) and
red-coloured cloth. They take eight mouthfuls of food in the house of
Brahmaṛshis, abstain from flesh and alcohol and strive after
emancipation alone through the path of yoga. Then the Hamsas should live
not more than a night in a village, five nights in a town, and seven
nights in a sacred place, partaking daily of cow's urine and cow's dung,
observing Chānḍrāyaṇa <span id="fr_103"></span>[3](#fn_102.md) and striving
after moksha alone through the path of yoga. Paramahamsas like
Samvarṭaka, Āruṇī, Śweṭakeṭu, Jadabharaṭa, Ḍaṭṭāṭreya, Śuka, Vāmaḍeva,
Hārīṭaka and others take eight mouthfuls and strive after moksha alone
through the path of yoga. They live clothed or naked at the foot of
trees, in ruined houses, or in burning grounds. With

them, there are no dualities as ḍharma and aḍharma, gain and loss, and
purity and impurity. They look upon gold and stone and clod of earth
with the same eye (of indifference), live on alms, begging from all
without any distinction of caste and look upon everything as Āṭmā alone.
Being (naked) as nature made them, being free from the sense of duality
and from covetousness, being engaged in pure contemplation
(śuklaḍhyāna), meditating on Āṭmā, and begging at stated times, simply
to keep the body and soul together, they reside in ruined houses,
temples, straw-huts, ant-hills, the foot of trees, potteries, the places
of agnihoṭra, the sand in the bed of rivers, mountain-caves, cavities,
the hollows of trees, waterfalls, and sṭhaṇdila (the level square piece
of ground prepared for sacrifice). Having advanced far in the path of
Brahman, and being pure in mind, they quit this body through the methods
prescribed for Paramahamsa Sannyāsins. These are the Paramahamsas. Such
is the Upanishaḍ.
