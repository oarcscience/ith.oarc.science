<p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">VAJRAS&#362;CHI&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_66"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>-UPANISHA&#7692;</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">OF</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">S&#256;MAVE&#7692;A</h3>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">I now</span> proceed to declare the vajras&#363;chi&#8212;the weapon that is the destroyer of ignorance&#8212;which condemns the ignorant and praises the man of divine vision.</p>  
<p>There are four castes&#8212;the br&#257;hma&#7751;a, the ksha&#7789;riya, the vai&#347;ya, and the &#347;&#363;&#7693;ra. Even the sm&#7771;&#7789;is declare in accordance with the words of the ve&#7693;as that the br&#257;hma&#7751;a alone is the most important of them.</p>  
<p>Then this remains to be examined. What is meant by the br&#257;hma&#7751;a? Is it a j&#299;va? Is it a body? Is it a class? Is it j&ntilde;&#257;na? Is it karma? Or is it a doer of &#7693;harma?</p>  
<p>To begin with: is j&#299;va the br&#257;hma&#7751;a? No. Since the j&#299;va is the same in the many past and future bodies (of all persons), and since the j&#299;va is the same in all of the many bodies obtained through the force of karma, therefore j&#299;va is not the br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</p>  
<p>Then is the body the br&#257;hma&#7751;a? No. Since the body, as it is made up of the five elements, is the same for all people down to cha&#7751;d&#257;las,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> etc., since old age and death, &#7693;harma and a&#7693;harma are found to be common to them all, since there is no absolute distinction that the br&#257;hma&#7751;as are white-coloured, the ksha&#7789;riyas red, the vai&#347;yas yellow, and the &#347;&#363;&#7693;ras dark, and since in burning the corpse of his father, etc., the stain of the murder of a br&#257;hma&#7751;a, etc., will accrue to the son, etc., therefore the body is not the br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></A></p>  
<p>Then is a class the br&#257;hma&#7751;a? No. Since many great &#7770;shis have sprung from other castes and orders of creation&#8212;&#7770;shya&#347;&#7771;&#7749;ga was born of deer; Kau&#347;ika, of Ku&#347;a grass; J&#257;mbuka of a jackal; V&#257;lm&#299;ki of valm&#299;ka (an ant-hill); Vy&#257;sa of a fisherman's daughter; Gau&#7789;ama, of the posteriors of a hare; Vasishtha of &#362;rva&#347;i&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and Agas&#7789;ya of a water-pot; thus have we heard. Of these, many &#7770;shis outside the caste even have stood first among the teachers of divine Wisdom; therefore a class is not the br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</p>  
<p>Is j&ntilde;&#257;na the br&#257;hma&#7751;a? No. Since there were many ksha&#7789;riyas and others well versed in the cognition of divine Truth, therefore j&ntilde;&#257;na is not the br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</p>  
<p>Then is karma the br&#257;hma&#7751;a? No. Since the pr&#257;rab&#7693;ha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, sa&ntilde;chi&#7789;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and &#257;gami&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> karmas are the same for all beings, and since all people perform their actions as impelled by karma, therefore karma is not the br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</p>  
<p>Then is a doer of &#7693;harma (virtuous actions) the br&#257;hma&#7751;a? No. Since there are many ksha&#7789;riyas, etc., who are givers of gold, therefore a doer of virtuous actions is not the br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</p>  
<p>Who indeed then is br&#257;hma&#7751;a? Whoever he may be, he who has directly realised his &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and who is directly cognizant, like the myrobalan in his palm, of his &#256;&#7789;ma that is without a second, that is devoid of class and actions, that is free from the faults of the six stains&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and the six changes, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> that is of the nature of truth, knowledge, bliss, and eternity, that is without any change in itself, that is the substratum of all the kalpas, that exists penetrating all things that pervades everything within and without as &#257;k&#257;&#347;, that is of nature of undivided bliss, that cannot be reasoned about and that is known only by direct cognition. He who by the reason of having obtained his wishes is devoid of the faults of thirst after worldly objects and passions, who is the possessor of the qualifications beginning</p>

<p>with &#347;ama&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, who is free from emotion, malice, thirst after worldly objects, desire, delusion, etc., whose mind is untouched by pride, egoism, etc., who possesses all these qualities and means&#8212;he only is the br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</p>  
<p>Such is the opinion of the ve&#7693;as, the sm&#7771;&#7789;is, the i&#7789;ih&#257;sa and the pur&#257;&#7751;as. Otherwise one cannot obtain the status of a br&#257;hma&#7751;a. One should meditate on his &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a, and the non-dual Brahman. Yea, one should meditate on his &#256;&#7789;m&#257; as the Sachchi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a Brahman. Such is the Upanisha&#7693;.</p>
