### OF

### ŚUKLA-YAJURVEḌA

##### <span class="smallcaps">Brāhmaṇa</span> I

<span class="smallcaps">Om</span>. The great muni Yājñavalkya went to
Aḍiṭyaloka (the sun's world) and saluting him (the Purusha of the sun)
said: "O reverend sir, describe to me the Āṭmā-ṭaṭṭva (the ṭaṭṭva or
truth of Āṭmā)."

(To which,) Nārāyaṇa (*viz*., the Purusha of the sun) replied: "I shall
describe the eightfold yoga together with Jñāna. The conquering of cold
and heat as well as hunger and sleep, the preserving of (sweet) patience
and unruffledness ever and the restraining of the organs (from sensual
objects)—all these come under (or are) yama. Devotion to one's guru,
love of the true path, enjoyment of objects producing happiness,
internal satisfaction, freedom from association, living in a retired
place, the controlling of the manas and the not longing after the fruits
of actions and a state of vairāgya—all these [constitute](errata.htm#17.md)
niyama. The sitting in any posture pleasant to one and clothed in
tatters (or bark) is prescribed for āsana (posture). Inspiration,
restraint of breath and expiration, which have respectively 16, 64 and
32 (māṭrās) constitute prāṇāyāma (restraint of breath). The restraining
of the mind from the objects of

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

senses is praṭyāhāra (subjugation of the senses). The contemplation of
the oneness of consciousness in all objects is ḍhyāna. The mind having
been drawn away from the objects of the senses, the fixing of the
chaiṭanya (consciousness) (on one alone) is ḍhāraṇā. The forgetting of
oneself in ḍhyāna is samāḍhi. He who thus knows the eight subtle parts
of yoga attains salvation.

"The body has five stains (*viz*.,) passion, anger, out-breathing, fear,
and sleep. The removal of these can be effected respectively by absence
of saṅkalpa, forgiveness, moderate food, carefulness, and a spiritual
sight of ṭaṭṭvas. In order to cross the ocean of samsāra where sleep and
fear are the serpents, injury, etc., are the waves, ṭṛshṇā (thirst) is
the whirlpool, and wife is the mire, one should adhere to the subtle
path and overstepping ṭaṭṭva <span id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_211.md) and
other guṇas should look out for Ṭāraka. <span
id="fr_227"></span>[2](#fn_212.md) Ṭāraka is Brahman which being in the
middle of the two eyebrows, is of the nature of the spiritual
[effulgence](errata.htm#18) of Sachchiḍānanḍa. The (spiritual.md) seeing
through the three lakshyas (or the three kinds of introvision) is the
means to It (Brahman). Sushumnā which is from the mūlāḍhāra to
brahmaranḍhra has the radiance of the sun. In the centre of it, is
kunḍalinī shining like crores of lightning and subtle as the thread in
the lotus-stalk. Ṭamas is destroyed there. Through seeing it, all sins
are destroyed. When the two ears are closed by the tips of the
forefingers, a phūṭkāra (or booming) sound is heard. When the mind is
fixed on it, it sees a blue light between the eyes as also in the heart.
(This is anṭarlakshya or internal [introvision](errata.htm#19).md). In the
bahirlakshya (or external introvision) one sees in order before his nose
at distance of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 digits, the space of blue colour,
then a colour resembling śyāma (indigo-black) and then shining as rakṭa
(red) wave and then with the two pīṭa (yellow and orange red) colours.
Then he is a yogin. When one looks at the external space, moving

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

the eyes and sees streaks of light at the corners of his eyes, then his
vision can be made steady. When one sees jyoṭis (spiritual light) above
his head 12 digits in length, then he attains the state of nectar. In
the maḍhyalakshya (or the middle one), one sees the variegated colours
of the morning as if the sun, the moon and the fire had joined together
in the ākāś that is without them. Then he comes to have their nature (of
light). Through practice, he becomes one with ākāś, devoid of all guṇas
and peculiarities. At first ākāś with its shining stars becomes to him
Para-ākāś as dark as ṭamas itself, and he becomes one with Para-ākāś
shining with stars and deep as ṭamas. (Then) he becomes one with
Mahā-ākāś resplendent (as) with the fire of the deluge. Then he becomes
one with Ṭaṭṭva-ākāś, lighted with the brightness which is the highest
and the best of all. Then he becomes one with Sūrya-ākāś (sun-ākāś)
brightened by a crore of suns. By practising thus, he becomes one with
them. He who knows them becomes thus.

"Know that yoga is twofold through its division into the pūrva (earlier)
and the uṭṭara (later). The earlier is ṭāraka and the later is amanaska
(the mindless). Ṭāraka is divided into mūrṭi (with limitation) and
amūrṭi (without limitation). That is mūrṭi ṭāraka which goes to the end
of the senses (or exists till the senses are conquered). That is amūrṭi
ṭāraka which goes beyond the two eyebrows (above the senses). Both these
should be performed through manas. Anṭarḍṛshti (internal vision)
associated with manas comes to aid ṭāraka. Ṭejas (spiritual light)
appears in the hole between the two eyebrows. This ṭāraka is the earlier
one. The later is amanaska. The great jyoṭis (light) <span
id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_213.md) is above the root of the palate. By
seeing it, one gets the siḍḍhis aṇimā, etc. Śāmbhavīmuḍrā occurs when
the lakshya (spiritual vision) is internal while the (physical) eyes are
seeing externally without winking. This is the great science which is
concealed in all the tanṭras. When this is known, one does not stay in
samsāra. Its worship (or practice) gives salvation. Anṭarlakshya is of

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

the nature of Jalajyoṭis (or waterjyotis). It is known by the great
Ṛshis and is invisible both to the internal and external senses.

"Sahasrāra (*viz*., the thousand-petalled lotus of the pineal gland)
Jalajyoṭis <span id="fr_229"></span>[1](#fn_214.md) is the anṭarlakshya.
Some say the form of Purusha in the cave of buḍḍhi beautiful in all its
parts is anṭarlakshya. Some again say that the all-quiescent Nīlakaṇtha
accompanied by Umā (his wife) and having five mouths and latent in the
midst of the sphere in the brain is anṭarlakshya. Whilst others say that
the Purusha of the dimension of a thumb is anṭarlakshya. A few again say
anṭarlakshya is the One Self made supreme through introvision in the
state of a jīvanmukṭa. All the different statements above made pertain
to Āṭmā alone. He alone is a Brahmanishtha who sees that the above
lakshya is the pure Āṭmā. The jīva which is the twenty-fifth ṭaṭṭva,
having abandoned the twenty-four ṭaṭṭvas, becomes a jīvanmukṭa through
the conviction that the twenty-sixth ṭaṭṭva (*viz*.,) Paramāṭmā is 'I'
alone. Becoming one with anṭarlakshya (Brahman) in the emancipated state
by means of anṭarlakshya (introvision), jīva becomes one with the
partless sphere of Paramākāś.

"Thus ends the first Brāhmaṇa."

##### <span class="smallcaps">Brāhmaṇa</span> II

Then Yājñavalkya asked the Purusha in the sphere of the sun: "O Lord,
anṭarlakshya has been described many times, but it has never been
understood by me (clearly). Pray describe it to me." He replied: "It is
the source of the five elements, has the lustre of many (streaks of)
lightning, and has four seats having (or rising from) 'That' (Brahman).
In its midst, there arises the manifestation of ṭaṭṭva. It is very
hidden and unmanifested. It can be known (only) by one who has got into
the boat of jñāna. It is the object of both bahir and anṭar (external
and internal) lakshyas. In its midst is absorbed

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

the whole world. It is the vast partless universe beyond Nāḍa, Binḍu and
Kara. Above it (*viz*., the sphere of agni) is the sphere of the sun; in
its midst is the sphere of the nectary moon; in its midst is the sphere
of the partless Brahma-ṭejas (or the spiritual effulgence of Brahman).
It has the brightness of Śukla (white light) <span
id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_215.md) like the ray of lightning. It alone has
the characteristic of Śāmbhavī. In seeing this, there are three kinds of
ḍṛshti (sight), *viz*., amā (the new moon), praṭipaṭ (the first day of
lunar fortnight), and pūrṇimā (the full moon). The sight of amā is the
one (seen) with closed eyes. That with half opened eyes is praṭipaṭ;
while that with fully opened eyes is pūrṇimā. Of these, the practice of
pūrṇimā should be resorted to. Its lakshya (or aim) is the tip of the
nose. Then is seen a deep darkness at the root of the palate. By
practising thus, a jyoṭis (light) of the form of an endless sphere is
seen. This alone is Brahman, the Sachchiḍānanḍa. When the mind is
absorbed in bliss thus naturally produced, then does Śāmbhavī take
place. She (Śāmbhavī) alone is called Khecharī. By practising it
(*viz*., the muḍrā), a man obtains firmness of mind. Through it, he
obtains firmness of vāyu. The following are the signs: first it is seen
like a star; then a reflecting (or dazzling) diamond; <span
id="fr_231"></span>[2](#fn_216.md) then the sphere of full moon; then the
sphere of the brightness of nine gems; then the sphere of the midday
sun; then the sphere of the flame of agni (fire); all these are seen in
order.

"(Thus much for the light in pūrva or first stage.) Then there is the
light in the western direction (in the uṭṭara or second stage). Then the
lustres of crystal, smoke, binḍu, nāḍa, kalā, star, firefly, lamp, eye,
gold, and nine gems, etc. are seen. This alone is the form of Praṇava.
Having united Prāṇa and Apāna and holding the breath in kumbhaka, one
should fix his concentration at the tip of his nose and making
shaṇmukhi <span id="fr_232"></span>[3](#fn_217.md) with the fingers of both
his hands, one hears

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

the sound of Praṇava (Om) in which manas becomes absorbed. Such a man
has not even the touch of karma. The karma of (Sanḍhyāvanḍana or the
daily prayers) is verily performed at the rising or setting of the sun.
As there is no rising or setting (but only the ever shining) of the sun
of Chiṭ (the higher consciousness) in the heart of a man who knows thus,
he has no karma to perform. Rising above (the conception of) day and
night through the annihilation of sound and time, he becomes one with
Brahman through the all-full jñāna and the attaining of the state of
unmanī (the state above manas). Through the state of unmanī, he becomes
amanaska (or without manas).

"Not being troubled by any thoughts (of the world) then constitutes the
ḍhyāna. <span id="fr_233"></span>[1](#fn_218.md) The abandoning of all
karmas constitutes āvāhana (invocation of god). Being firm in the
unshaken (spiritual) wisdom constitutes āsana (posture). Being in the
state of unmanī constitutes the pāḍya (offering of water for washing the
feet of god). Preserving the state of amanaska (when manas is offered as
sacrifice) constitutes the arghya (offering of water as oblation
generally). Being in state of eternal brightness and shoreless nectar
constitutes snāna (bathing). The contemplation of Āṭmā as present in all
constitutes (the application to the idol of) sandal. The remaining in
the real state of the ḍṛk (spiritual eye) is (the worshipping with)
akshaṭa;(non-broken rice). The attaining of Chiṭ (consciousness) is (the
worshipping with) flower. The real state of agni (fire) of Chiṭ is the
ḍhūpa (burning of incense). The state of the sun of Chiṭ is the ḍīpa
(light waved before the image). The union of oneself with the nectar of
full moon is the naivēḍya (offering of food, etc.). <span
id="fr_234"></span>[2](#fn_219.md) The immobility in that state (of the ego
being one with all) is praḍakshiṇa (going round the image). The
conception of 'I am He' is namaskāra (prostration). The silence (then)
is the sṭuṭi (praise). The all-contentment (or serenity then) is the
visarjana (giving leave to god or finishing worship). (This is

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

the worship of Āṭmā by all Raja-yogins). He who knows this knows all.

"When the ṭriputi <span id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_220.md) are thus
dispelled, he becomes the kaivalya jyoṭis without bhāva (existence) or
abhāva (nonexistence), full and motionless, like the ocean without the
tides or like the lamp without the wind. He becomes a brahmaviṭ (knower
of Brahman) by cognising the end of the sleeping state, even while in
the waking state. Though the (same) mind is absorbed in sushupṭi as also
in samāḍhi, there is much difference between them. (In the former case)
as the mind is absorbed in ṭamas, it does not become the means of
salvation, (but) in samāḍhi as the modifications of ṭamas in him are
rooted away, the mind raises itself to the nature of the Partless. All
that is no other than Sākshi-Chaiṭanya (witness-consciousness or the
Higher Self) into which the absorption of the whole universe takes
place, inasmuch as the universe is but a delusion (or creation) of the
mind and is therefore not different from it. Though the universe appears
perhaps as outside of the mind, still it is unreal. He who knows Brahman
and who is the sole enjoyer of brāhmic bliss which is eternal and has
dawned once (for all in him)—that man becomes one with Brahman. He in
whom saṅkalpa perishes has got mukṭi in his hand. Therefore one becomes
an emancipated person through the contemplation of Paramāṭmā. Having
given up both bhāva and abhāva, one becomes a jīvanmukṭa by leaving off
again and again in all states jñāna (wisdom) and jñeya (object of
wisdom), ḍhyāna (meditation) and ḍhyeya (object of meditation), lakshya
(the aim) and alakshya (non-aim), ḍṛśya (the visible) and aḍṛśya (the
non-visible and ūha (reasoning) and apoha (negative reasoning). <span
id="fr_236"></span>[2](#fn_221.md) He who knows this knows all.

"There are five avasṭhās (states), *viz*.: jāgraṭ (waking), svapna
(dreaming), sushupṭi (dreamless sleeping), the ṭurya (fourth) and
turyāṭīṭa (that beyond the fourth). The jīva (ego) that is engaged in
the waking state becomes attached to the pravṛṭṭi (worldly) path and is
the participator of naraka (hell) as the

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

fruit of sins. He desires svarga (heaven) as the fruit of his virtuous
actions. This very same person becomes (afterwards) indifferent to all
these saying, "Enough of the births tending to actions, the fruits of
which tend to bondage till the end of this mundane existence." Then he
pursues the nivṛṭṭi (return) path with a view to attain emancipation.
And this person then takes refuge in a spiritual instructor in order to
cross this mundane existence. Giving up passion and others, he does only
those he is asked to do. Then having acquired the four sāḍhanas (means
to salvation), he attains, in the middle of the lotus of his heart, the
Reality of anṭarlakshya that is but the Saṭ of Lord and begins to
recognise (or recollect) the bliss of Brahman which he had left (or
enjoyed) in his sushupṭi state. At last he attains this state of
discrimination (thus): 'I think I am the non-dual One only. I was in
ajñāna for some time (in the waking state and called therefore Viśva). I
became somehow (or involuntarily) a Ṭaijasa (in the dreaming state)
through the reflection (in that state) of the affinities of the
forgotten waking state; and now I am a Prājña through the disappearance
of those two states. Therefore I am one only. I (appear) as more than
one through the differences of state and place. And there is nothing of
differentiation of class besides me.' Having expelled even the smack of
the difference (of conception) between 'I' and 'That' through the
thought 'I am the pure and the secondless Brahman', and having attained
the path of salvation which is of the nature of Parabrahman, after
having become one with It through the ḍhyāna of the sun's sphere as
shining with himself, he becomes fully ripened for getting salvation.
Saṅkalpa and others are the causes of the bondage of the mind; and the
mind devoid of these becomes fit for salvation. Possessing such a mind
free from all (saṅkalpa, etc.,) and withdrawing himself from the outer
world of sight and others and so keeping himself out of the odour of the
universe, he looks upon all the world as Āṭmā, abandons the conception
of 'I', thinks I am Brahman' and considers all these as Āṭmā. Through
these, he becomes one who has done his duty.

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

"The yogin is one that has realised Brahman that is all-full beyond
ṭurya. They (the people) extol him as Brahman; and becoming the object
of the praise of the whole world, he wanders over different countries.
Placing the binḍu in the ākāś of Paramāṭmā and pursuing the path of the
partless bliss produced by the pure, secondless, stainless, and innate
yoga sleep of amanaska, he becomes an emancipated person. Then the yogin
becomes immersed in the ocean of bliss. When compared to it, the bliss
of Inḍra and others is very little. He who gets this bliss is the
supreme yogin.

"Thus ends the second Brāhmaṇa."

##### <span class="smallcaps">Brāhmaṇa</span> III

The great sage Yājñavalkya then asked the Purusha in the sphere (of the
sun): "O Lord, though the nature of amanaska has been defined (by you),
yet I forget it (or do not understand it clearly). Therefore pray
explain it again to me." Accordingly the Purusha said: "This amanaska is
a great secret. By knowing this, one becomes a person who has done his
duty. One should look upon it as Paramāṭmā, associated with
Śāmbhavīmuḍrā and should know also all those that can be known through a
(thorough) cognition of them. Then seeing Parabrahman in his own Āṭma as
the Lord of all, the immeasurable, the birthless, the auspicious, the
supreme ākāś, the supportless, the secondless the only goal of Brahma,
Vishṇu and Ruḍra and the cause of all and assuring himself that he who
plays in the cave (of the heart) is such a one, he should raise himself
above the dualities of existence and non-existence; and knowing the
experience of the unmanī of his manas, he then attains the state of
Parabrahman which is motionless as a lamp in a windless place, having
reached the ocean of brāhmic bliss by means of the river of
amanaska-yoga through the destruction of all his senses. Then he
resembles a dry tree. Having lost all (idea of) the universe through the
disappearance of growth, sleep, disease, expiration and inspiration, his
body being always steady, he comes to have a supreme quiescence, being
devoid of the movements of

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

his manas and becomes absorbed in Paramāṭma. The destruction of manas
takes place after the destruction of the collective senses, like the
cow's udder (that shrivels up) after the milk has been drawn. It is this
that is amanaska. By following this, one becomes always pure and becomes
one that has done his duty, having been filled with the partless bliss
by means of the path of ṭāraka-yoga through the initiation into the
sacred sentences 'I am Paramāṭmā,' 'That art thou,' 'I am thou alone,'
'Thou art I alone,' etc.

"When his manas is immersed in the ākāś and he becomes all-full, and
when he attains the unmanī state, having abandoned all his collective
senses, he conquers all sorrows and impurities through the partless
bliss, having attained the fruits of kaivalya, ripened through the
collective merits gathered in all his previous lives and thinking always
'I am Brahman,' becomes one that has done his duty. 'I am thou alone.
There is no difference between thee and me owing to the fullness of
Paramāṭmā.' Saying thus, he (the Purusha of the sun) embraced his
pupil <span id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_222.md) and made him understand it.

"Thus ends the third Brāhmaṇa."

##### <span class="smallcaps">Brāhmaṇa</span> IV

Then Yājñavalkya addressed the Purusha in the sphere (of the sun) thus:
"Pray explain to me in detail the nature of the fivefold division of
ākāś." He replied: "There are five (*viz*.): ākāś, parākāś, mahākāś,
sūryākāś, and paramākāś. That which is of the nature of darkness, both
in and out is the first ākāś. That which has the fire of the deluge,
both in and out is truly mahākāś. That which has the brightness of the
sun, both in and out is sūryākāś. That brightness which is
indescribable, all-pervading and of the nature of unrivalled bliss is
paramākāś. By cognising these according to this description, one becomes
of their nature. He is a yogin only in name, who does not cognise well
the nine chakras, the six āḍhāras, the three lakshyas and the five ākāś.
Thus ends the fourth Brāhmaṇa."

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

##### <span class="smallcaps">Brāhmaṇa</span> V

"The manas influenced by worldly objects is liable to bondage; and that
(manas) which is not so influenced by these is fit for salvation. Hence
all the world becomes an object of chiṭṭa; whereas the same chiṭṭa when
it is supportless and well-ripe in the state of unmanī, becomes worthy
of laya (absorption in Brahman). This absorption you should learn from
me who am the all-full. I alone am the cause of the absorption of manas.
The manas is within the jyoṭis (spiritual light) which again is latent
in the spiritual sound which pertains to the anāhaṭa (heart) sound. That
manas which is the agent of creation, preservation, and destruction of
the three worlds—that same manas becomes absorbed in that which is the
highest seat of Vishṇu; through such an absorption, one gets the pure
and secondless state, owing to the absence of difference then. This
alone is the highest truth. He who knows this, will wander in the world
like a lad or an idiot or a demon or a simpleton. By practising this
amanaska, one is ever contented, his urine and fæces become diminished,
his food becomes lessened: he becomes strong in body and his limbs are
free from disease and sleep. Then his breath and eyes being motionless,
he realises Brahman and attains the nature of bliss.

"That ascetic who is intent on drinking the nectar of Brahman produced
by the long practice of this kind of samāḍhi, becomes a paramahamsa
(ascetic) or an avaḍhūṭa (naked ascetic). By seeing him, all the world
becomes pure, and even an illiterate person who serves him is freed from
bondage. He (the ascetic) enables the members of his family for one
hundred and one generations to cross the ocean of samsāra; and his
mother, father, wife, and children—all these are similarly freed. Thus
is the Upanishaḍ. Thus ends the fifth Brāhmaṇa."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_210"></span>[243:1](tmu30.htm#fr_225.md) Maṇdala means sphere.
As the Purusha in the maṇdala or sphere of the sun gives out this
Upanishaḍ to Yājñavalkya, hence it is called Maṇdala-Brāhmaṇa. It is
very mystic. There is a book called *Rājayoga Bhāshya* which is a
commentary thereon; in the light of it which is by some attributed to
Śri Saṅkarāchārya, notes are given herein.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[244:1](tmu30.htm#fr_226.md) Comm.: Rising above
the seven Prāṇas, one should with introvision cognise in the region of
Ākās, Ṭamas and should then make Ṭamas get into Rajas, Rajas into
Saṭṭva, Saṭṭva into Nārāyaṇa and Nārāyaṇa, into the Supreme One.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[244:2](tmu30.htm#fr_227.md) Ṭāraka is from tr.,
to cross, as it enables one to cross samsāra. The higher vision is here
said to take place in a centre between the eyebrows—probably in the
brain.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[245:1](tmu30.htm#fr_228.md) The commentator puts
it as 12 digits above the root of the palate—perhaps the Ḍvāḍasānṭa or
twelfth centre corresponding to the pituitary body.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[246:1](tmu30.htm#fr_229.md) The commentator to
support the above that anṭarlakshya, *viz*., Brahman is jala- or
water-jyoṭis quotes the Prāṇāyāma-Gāyaṭrī which says: "Om
Āpojyoṭī-raso’amṛṭam-Brahma, etc."—Apo-jyoṭis or water-jyoṭis is
Brahman.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[247:1](tmu30.htm#fr_230.md) Comm.: Śukla is
Brahman.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[247:2](tmu30.htm#fr_231.md) The original is,
'Vajra-Ḍarpaṇam.'

<span id="fn_217"></span>[247:3](tmu30.htm#fr_232.md) Shaṇmukhi is said to
be the process of hearing the internal sound by closing the two ears
with the two thumbs, the two eyes with the two forefingers, the two
nostrils with the two middle fingers, and the mouth with the remaining
two fingers of both hands.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[248:1](tmu30.htm#fr_233.md) In this paragraph,
the higher or secret meaning is given of all actions done in the pūjā or
worship of God in the Hinḍū houses as well as temples. Regarding the
clothing of the idol which is left out here, the commentator explains it
as āvaraṇa or screen.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[248:2](tmu30.htm#fr_234.md) Here also the
commentator brings in nīrājana or the waving of the light before the
image. That is according to him, the idea, "I am the self-shining."

<span id="fn_220"></span>[249:1](tmu30.htm#fr_235.md) The Triputi are the
three, the knower, the known and the knowledge. Comm.: Ḍhyāna and others
stated before wherein the three distinctions are made.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[249:2](tmu30.htm#fr_236.md) Ūha and apoha—the
consideration of the pros and cons.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[252:1](tmu30.htm#fr_237.md) This is a reference
to the secret way of imparting higher truth.
