<p>[<small>In the text, all the questions are given first and then the answers follow. But the following arrangement is adopted to facilitate reference.</small>]</p>  
<p>1. What is Ban&#7693;ha (bondage).</p>  
<p>&#256;&#7789;m&#257; [the Self] falsely superimposing the body and others which are not-Self upon Himself, and identifying Himself with them&#8212;this identification forms the bondage of the Self.</p>  
<p>2. What is Moksha [emancipation]?</p>  
<p>The freedom from that [identification] is Moksha.</p>  
<p>3. What is Avi&#7693;y&#257; (Nescience)?</p>  
<p>That which causes this identification&#8212;that indeed is Avi&#7693;y&#257;.</p>  
<p>4. What is Vi&#7693;y&#257; (knowledge)?</p>  
<p>That which removes this identification is Vi&#7693;y&#257;.</p>  
<p>5. What are (meant by) the states of J&#257;gra&#7789; [the waking], Swapna [the dreaming], Sushup&#7789;i [the dreamless sleeping] and &#7788;ur&#299;ya [the fourth]?</p>  
<p>J&#257;gra&#7789; is that [state] during which &#256;&#7789;m&#257; enjoys the gross objects of senses as sound, etc., through the 14 organs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#fn_2"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> as Manas, etc., having the sun and the rest as their presiding deities.</p>  
<p>Swapna is that [state] during which &#256;&#7789;m&#257; experiences, through the 14 organs associated with the V&#257;san&#257;s [affinities],</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></A></p>  
<p>of the waking condition, sound and other objects which are of the form of the V&#257;san&#257;s created for the time being, even in the absence of [the gross] sound and the others. &#256;&#7789;m&#257; experiences Sushup&#7789;i when it does not experience sound and other objects of sense from the cessation of the functions of the 14 organs, there being no special enjoying consciousness on account of the absence of these organs.</p>  
<p>&#7788;ur&#299;ya is that state during which &#256;&#7789;m&#257; is a witness to the existence of the above-mentioned three states, though it is in itself without (their) existence and non-existence and during which it is one uninterrupted Chai&#7789;anya (consciousness) alone. And that Chai&#7789;anya is that which is connected with the three states, which is without the three states, and which is pare.</p>  
<p>6. What are the Annamaya, Pr&#257;&#7751;amaya, Manomaya, Vij&ntilde;&#257;namaya and &#256;nan&#7693;amaya Ko&#347;as (sheaths)?</p>  
<p>Annamaya sheath is the aggregate of the materials formed by food. When the ten V&#257;yus (Vital airs), Pr&#257;&#7751;as and others, flow through the Annamaya sheath, then it is called the Pr&#257;&#7751;amaya sheath. When &#256;&#7789;m&#257; connected with the above two sheaths performs the functions of hearing, etc., through the 14 organs of Man as and others, then it is called Manomaya sheath.</p>  
<p>When in the (Anta&#7717;-kara&#7751;a) internal organs connected with the above three sheaths, there arise the modifications of contemplation, meditation, etc., about the peculiarities of the sheaths, then it is called Vij&ntilde;&#257;namaya sheath.</p>  
<p>When the self-cause J&ntilde;&#257;na is in its Self-bliss like the banyan tree in its seed, though associated with these four sheaths caused by Aj&ntilde;&#257;na, then it is called &#256;nan&#7693;amaya sheath. &#256;&#7789;m&#257; which is associated with the Up&#257;&#7693;hi [vehicle] of these sheaths is figuratively called Ko&#347;a.</p>  
<p>7. What is meant by Kar&#7789;&#257; (actor), J&#299;va, Pa&ntilde;chavarga [the five groups], Kshe&#7789;raj&ntilde;a (the lord of the place), S&#257;kshi [the witness], K&#363;tas&#7789;ha and An&#7789;ary&#257;min (the latent guide)?</p>  
<p>Kar&#7789;&#257; (the actor) is the one who possesses the body and the internal organs through their respective desires proceeding from the idea of pleasure and pain. The idea of pleasure is that modification of the mind known as love. The idea of pain is</p>  
<p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></A></p>  
<p>that modification of the mind known as hate. The cause of pleasure and pain are sound, touch, form, taste and odour.</p>  
<p>J&#299;va is that A&#7693;hy&#257;si [deluded one] that thinks that this body, which is obtained through the effects of good and bad Karmas, is one not so obtained.</p>  
<p>Pa&ntilde;chavarga (the five groups) are (1) Manas, <i>viz</i>., Manas, Bu&#7693;&#7693;hi, Chi&#7789;&#7789;a and Aha&#7749;k&#257;ra (creating uncertainty, certitude, flitting thought and egoism), (2) Pr&#257;&#7751;a, <i>i.e.</i>, Pr&#257;&#7751;a, Ap&#257;na, Vy&#257;na Sam&#257;na and U&#7693;&#257;na, (3) Sa&#7789;&#7789;wa, <i>i.e.</i>, Sa&#7789;&#7789;wa, Rajas, and &#7788;amas. (4) the [five] elements: earth, water, fire, V&#257;yu and &#256;k&#257;&#347; and (5) &#7692;harma and its opposite A&#7693;harma.</p>  
<p>The original Avi&#7693;y&#257; which has the characteristics of the above 5 groups, which does not perish without &#256;&#7789;m&#257;-J&ntilde;&#257;na, which appears eternal through the presence of &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and which is the vehicle for [the manifestation of] &#256;&#7789;m&#257;, is the seed of the Li&#7749;ga [subtle] body. It is also called H&#7771;&#7693;aya-gran&#7789;hi [the heart-knot].</p>  
<p>The Chai&#7789;anya [consciousness] which is reflected and shines in it is Kshe&#7789;raj&ntilde;a.</p>  
<p>S&#257;kshi [the witness] is that conscious one that is aware of the appearance and disappearance [of the three states] of the knower, the knowledge and the known, who is himself without [or not affected by] this appearance and disappearance, and who is self-radiant.</p>  
<p>K&#363;tas&#7789;ha is he who is found without exception in the Bu&#7693;&#7693;hi of all creatures from Brahma down to ants, and who is shining as &#256;&#7789;m&#257; and dwells as witness to the Bu&#7693;&#7693;hi of all creatures.</p>  
<p>An&#7789;ary&#257;min is the &#256;&#7789;m&#257; that shines as the ordainer, being within all bodies like the thread [on which] beads [are strung] and serving to know the cause of the several differences of K&#363;tas&#7789;ha and others associated with him.</p>  
<p>8. Who is Pra&#7789;yag&#257;&#7789;m&#257;?</p>  
<p>He is of the nature of truth, wisdom, eternity and bliss. He has no vehicles of body. He is abstract wisdom itself, like a mass of pure gold that is devoid of the changes of bracelet, crown, etc. He is of the nature of mere consciousness. He is that which shines as Chai&#7789;anya and Brahman. When He is</p>  
<p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></A></p>  
<p>subject to the vehicle of Avi&#7693;y&#257; and is the meaning of the word "&#7788;wam" ('Thou' in "&#7788;a&#7789;&#7789;wamasi"), then He is Pra&#7789;yag&#257;&#7789;m&#257;.</p>  
<p>9. Who is Param&#257;&#7789;m&#257;?</p>  
<p>It is He who is associated with truth, wisdom, eternity, bliss, omniscience, etc., who is subject to the vehicle of M&#257;y&#257; and who is the meaning of the word "&#7788;a&#7789;" (or 'That' in "&#7788;a&#7789;&#7789;wamasi").</p>  
<p>10. What is Brahman?</p>  
<p>Brahman is that which is free from all vehicles, which is the Absolute Consciousness devoid of particularities, which is Sa&#7789; (Be-ness), which is without a second, which is bliss and which is M&#257;y&#257;-less. It is different from characteristics of that expressed by the word "&#7788;wam" (Thou) subject to Up&#257;&#7693;his (vehicles), or the characteristics of 'That' expressed by the word "&#7788;a&#7789;" subject to Up&#257;&#7693;his. It is itself differenceless and is seen as the Seat of everything. It is the pure, the noumenal, the true and the indestructible.</p>  
<p>And what is Sa&#7789;ya (the true)?</p>  
<p>It is the Sa&#7789; (Be-ness) which is the aim pointed out by the Ve&#7693;as. It is that which cannot be said to be Asa&#7789; (not-Be-ness). It is that which is not affected by the three periods of time. It is that which continues to exist during the three periods of time. It is that which is. It is one without a second. It has not the differences of similarity or dissimilarity; or it is that which is the source of all ideas. It is that which does not perish even though space, time, matter, cause, etc., perish.</p>  
<p>And what is J&ntilde;&#257;na (wisdom)?</p>  
<p>It is self-light. It is that which illuminates all. It is that Absolute Consciousness which is without any obscuration. It is that Consciousness which has no beginning or end, which is perpetual and which is the witness to all modifications and their opposites.</p>  
<p>And what is Anan&#7789;a (the eternal)?</p>  
<p>It is that which is without origin and destruction. It is that which is not subject to the six changes (<i>viz</i>., birth, growth, manhood, decay, old age and death). It is free from all Up&#257;&#7693;his. It is that Consciousness which, being all full and without</p>  
<p><a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></A></p>  
<p>destruction, permeates the created universe composed of Avyak&#7789;a and others, like the earth in the modifications of clay, the gold in the modifications of gold, and thread in the modifications of thread.</p>  
<p>And what is &#256;nan&#7693;a (bliss)?</p>  
<p>It is the seat of all sentient beings, like the ocean of the water, is eternal, pure, partless and non-dual, and is the sole essence of Chi&#7693;&#257;nan&#7693;a (consciousness-bliss).</p>  
<p>11. Of how many kinds are substances?</p>  
<p>There are three kinds, Sa&#7789; (Be-ness), Asa&#7789; (not-Be-ness) and Mi&#7789;hy&#257; (Illusion).</p>  
<p>Sa&#7789; alone is Brahman. Asa&#7789; is that which is not. Mi&#7789;hy&#257; is the illusory ascription to Brahman of the universe that is not.</p>  
<p>What is fit to be known is Brahman, the &#256;&#7789;m&#257; alone.</p>  
<p>Brahma-J&ntilde;&#257;na is the rooting out of all&#8212;bodies and such like&#8212;that are not Self, and the merging in Brahman, the Sa&#7789;. The universe of &#256;k&#257;&#347; and others including J&#299;va is not-&#256;&#7789;m&#257;.</p>  
<p>12. What is M&#257;y&#257;?</p>  
<p>The root of this not-&#256;&#7789;m&#257; is M&#257;y&#257;. She appears in Brahman like clouds, etc., in the sky. She has no beginning but has an end. She is subject to proof and not-proof. She neither is; nor is not; nor is she a combination of both (Sa&#7789; and Asa&#7789;). Her seat is indescribable. She has the varieties of differences as extolled by the wise. It is she that truly is not. Her nature is Aj&ntilde;&#257;na. She appears as M&#363;laprak&#7771;&#7789;i, Gu&#7751;a-S&#257;mya (a state where the three Gu&#7751;as are found in equilibrium),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#fn_3"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Avi&#7693;y&#257; (Nescience) and other forms, transforming herself into the form of the universe. Thus does a knower of Brahman cognize her.</p>
