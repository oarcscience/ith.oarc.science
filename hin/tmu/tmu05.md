### OF

### ŚUKLA-YAJURVEḌA

<span class="smallcaps">Harih-Om</span>. I shall relate in the form of a
catechism whatever should be known for the removal of all miseries that
befall these ignorant creatures \[men\].

What is Brahman? Who is Īśwara? Who is Jīva? What is Prakṛṭi? Who is
Paramāṭmā? Who is Brahmā? Who is Vishṇu? Who is Ruḍra? Who is Inḍra? Who
is Yama? Who is Sūrya? Who is Chanḍra? Who are Ḍevas? Who are Rākshasas?
Who are Piśāchas? Who are Manushyas? Who are Women? Who are Paśus, etc.?
What is Sṭhāvara? Who are Brahmans and others? What is Jāṭi (caste)?
What is Karma? What is Akarma? What is Jñāna? What is Ajñāna? What is
Sukha? What is Ḍuḥkha? What is Swarga? What is Naraka? What is Banḍha?
What is Moksha? Who is Upāsya? Who is Viḍwān? Who is Mūdha? What is
Āsura? What is Ṭapas? What is Paramapaḍa? What is Grāhya? What is
Agrāhya? Who is Sannyāsi? Thus are the questions.

1\. What is Brahman?

It is the Chaiṭanya that appears, through the aspects of Karma and
Jñāna, as this vast mundane egg composed of Mahaṭ, Ahaṅkāra and the five
elements, earth, water, fire, Vāyu and [Ākāś](errata.htm#2.md)—that is
secondless—that is devoid of all Upāḍhis \[vehicles\], that is full of
all Śakṭis \[potencies\], that is without beginning and end, that is
described as pure, beneficial, peaceful, and Guṇa-less and that is
indescribable.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

2\. Who is Īśwara? and what are His characteristics?

[Brahman](errata.htm#3.md) itself, having through His Śakṭi called Prakṛṭi
(matter) created the worlds and being latent in them, becomes the ruler
of Buḍḍhi and Inḍriyas (organs of sense and action) as well as Brahma
(the creator) and others. Hence he is named Īśwara.

3\. Who is Jīva?

Īśwara Himself, subject to the false superimposition upon Himself \[of
the idea\] "I am the gross" through the \[assumption of the\] names and
forms of Brahmā, Vishṇu, Ruḍra, Inḍra, and others is Jīva. Though one,
he appears as many Jīvas, through the force of the different Karmas
originating the bodies.

4\. What is Prakṛṭi (matter)?

It is nothing else but the Śakṭi \[potency\] of Brahman which is of the
nature of Buḍḍhi that is able to produce the many motley worlds by
virtue of the mere presence of Brahman.

5\. What is Paramāṭmā?

The supreme Āṭmā or soul. It is Brahman alone that is Paramāṭmā as it
(the former) is far superior to bodies and others.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

6\. Who is Brahmā \[the creator\]?  
7. Who is Vishṇu \[the preserver\]?  
8. Who is Ruḍra \[the destroyer\]?  
9. Who is Inḍra?  
10. Who is Yama \[the angel of death\]?  
11. Who is Sūrya \[the Sun\]?  
12. Who is Chanḍra \[the Moon\]?  
13. Who are Ḍevas \[the Angels\]?  
14. Who are Asuras \[the Demons\]?  
15. Who are Piśāchas \[the evil spirits\]?  
16. Who are Manushyas \[the men\]?  
17. Who are Women?  
18. What are beasts, etc.?  
19. What are the Sṭhāvaras \[fixed ones\]?  
20. Who are Brahmans and others?

</div>

That Brahman is Brahmā, Vishṇu, Ruḍra and Inḍra, Yama, Sun and Moon,
Ḍevas, Asuras, Piśāchas, men, women, beasts, etc., the fixed ones,
Brahmans and others. Here there is no manyness in the least degree: all
this is verily Brahman.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

21\. What is Jāṭi (caste)

It cannot refer to the skin, the blood, the flesh or the bone. There is
no caste for Āṭmā; caste is only conventional.

22\. What is Karma?

Karma is that action alone which is performed by the organs and ascribed
to Āṭmā as "I do" (*viz*., agency being attributed to Āṭmā).

23\. What is Akarma \[or non-Karma\]?

Akarma is the performance, without any desire for the fruits, of the
daily and occasional rites, sacrifices, vows, austerities, gifts and
other actions that are associated with the egoism of the actor and the
enjoyer, and that are productive of bondage, rebirth, etc.

24\. What is Jñāna?

It is the realisation by direct cognition of the fact that in this
changing universe there is nothing but Chaiṭanya \[the one life\] that
is Consciousness, that is of the form of the seer and the seen,
pervading all things, that is the same in all, and that is not subject
to changes like pot, cloth, etc. This realisation is brought about by
means of the subjugation of the body and the senses, the serving of a
good Guru (teacher), the hearing of the exposition of Veḍānṭic doctrines
and constant meditation thereon.

25\. What is Ajñāna?

It is the illusory attribution, like the snake in the rope, of many
Āṭmās (souls) through the diverse Upāḍhis \[or vehicles\] of the angels,
beasts, men, the fixed ones, females, males, castes and orders of life,
bondage and emancipation, etc., to Brahman that is secondless,
all-permeating and of the nature of all.

26\. What is Sukha (happiness)?

It is a state of being of the nature of bliss, having cognized through
experience the Reality of Sachchiḍānanḍa \[or that which is be-ness,
consciousness and bliss\].

27\. What is Ḍuḥkha (pains)?

It is the mere Saṅkalpa \[or the thinking\] of the objects of mundane
existence \[or of not-Self according to the Bombay Edition\].

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

28\. What is Swarga (heaven)?

It is the association with Saṭ \[either good men or Brahman which is
Saṭ, the true\].

29\. What is Naraka (hell)?

It is the association with that which brings about this mundane
existence which is Asaṭ \[the false\].

30\. What is Banḍha \[bondage\]?

Such Saṅkalpas \[thoughts\] as "I was born," etc., arising from the
affinities of beginningless Ajñāna form bondage.

The thought obscuration \[or mental ignorance\] of the mundane existence
of "mine" in such as father, mother, brother, wife, child, house,
gardens, lands, etc., forms bondage.

The thoughts of I-ness as actor, etc., are bondage.

The thought of the development in oneself of the eight Siḍḍhis (higher
psychical powers) as Anima and others <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md)
is bondage.

The thought of propitiating the angels, men, etc., is bondage. The
thought of going through the eight means of Yoga <span
id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md) practice, Yama, etc., is bondage.

The thought of performing the duties of one's own caste and order of
life is bondage.

The thought that command, fear and doubt are the attributes of \[or
pertain to\] Āṭmā is bondage.

The thought of knowing the rules of performing sacrifices, vows,
austerity and gift is bondage. Even the mere thought of desire for
Moksha (emancipation) is bondage. By the very act of thought, bondage is
caused.

31\. What is Moksha \[emancipation\]?

Moksha is the (state of) the annihilation, through the discrimination of
the eternal from the non-eternal, of all thoughts of bondage, like those
of "mine" in objects of pleasure and pain, lands, etc., in this
transitory mundane existence.

32\. Who is Upāsya \[or fit to be worshipped\]?

That Guru (or spiritual instructor) who enables (the disciple) to attain
to Brahman, the Consciousness that is in all bodies.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

33\. Who is Śishya (the disciple)?

The disciple is that Brahman alone that remains after the consciousness
of the universe has been lost (in him) through Brāhmic wisdom.

34\. Who is Viḍwān (the learned)?

It is he who has cognized the true form (or reality) of his own
consciousness that is latent in all.

35\. Who is Mūdha \[the ignorant\]?

He who has the egoistic conception of the body, caste, orders of life,
actor, enjoyer and others.

36\. What is Āsura \[the demoniacal\]?

It is the Ṭapas \[austerity\] practised by one inflicting trouble on the
Āṭmā within through Japa \[or inaudible muttering of Manṭras\],
abstinence from food, Agnihoṭra \[the performance of the worship of
fire\], etc., attended with cruel desire, hatred, pain, hypocrisy and
the rest for the purpose of acquiring the powers of Vishṇu, Brahma,
Ruḍra, Inḍra and others.

37\. What is Ṭapas?

Ṭapas is the act of burning—through the fire of direct cognition of the
knowledge that Brahman is the truth and the universe, a myth—the seed of
the deep-rooted desire to attain the powers of Brahma, etc.

38\. What is Paramapaḍa \[the supreme abode\]?

It is the seat of the eternal and emancipated Brahman which is far
superior to Prāṇas (the vital airs), the organs of sense and actions,
the internal organs (of thought), the Guṇas and others, which is of the
nature of Sachchiḍānanḍa and which is the witness to all.

39\. What is Grāhya \[or fit to be taken in\]?

Only that Reality of Absolute Consciousness which is not conditioned by
space, time or substance.

40\. What is Agrāhya?

The thought that this universe is truth—this universe which is different
from one's Self and which being subject to Māyā (or illusion) forms the
object of (cognition of) Buḍḍhi and the organs.

41\. Who is the Sannyāsi \[ascetic\]?

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

A Sannyāsi is an ascetic who having given up all the duties of caste and
orders of life, good and bad actions, etc., being freed from \[the
conceptions of\] "I" and "mine" and having taken his refuge in Brahman
alone, roams at large practising Nirvikalpa Samāḍhi and being firmly
convinced of "I am Brahman" through the realisation of the meaning of
such sacred (Vedic) sentences as "Thou art That" "All this is verily
Brahman" and "Here there is no manyness in the least". He only is an
emancipated person. He only is fit to be adored. He only is a Yogin. He
only is a Paramahamsa. He only is an Avaḍhūṭa. He only is a Brahman.
Whoever studies the Nirālamba-Upanishaḍ becomes, through the grace of
Guru, pure like fire. Ho becomes pure like Vāyu (air). He does not
return. He is not born again: nay he is not born again.

Such is the Upanishaḍ.
