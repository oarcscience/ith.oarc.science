### KAIVALYA <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)-UPANISHAḌ

### OF

### KṚSHṆA-YAJURVEḌA

<span class="smallcaps">Harih-Om</span>. Then <span
id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8) Āśwalāyana went to Lord Parameshtī (Brahmā.md)
and addressed Him thus: "Please initiate me into Brahmaviḍyā (Divine
Wisdom), which is the most excellent, which is ever enjoyed by the wise,
which is mystic, and by which the learned, after having soon freed
themselves from all sins, reach Purusha, the Supreme of the supreme."

To him the Grandfather (thus);replied: "Know (It) through Śraḍḍhā
(faith), Bhakṭi (devotion), Ḍhyāna (meditation), and Yoga. Persons
attain salvation not through Karma, progeny or wealth but through
Sannyāsa (renunciation) alone. Ascetics of pure mind through (the
realisation of) the meaning well-ascertained by Veḍānṭa-Vijñāna and
through Śannyāsa-Yoga enter into That which is above Swarga (heaven) and
is in the cave (of the heart). They all attain Paramāṭmā <span
id="fr_9"></span>[3](#fn_9) in the Brahma-world and are (finally.md)
emancipated.

"Being seated in a pleasant posture in an unfrequented place with a pure
mind, and with his neck, head, and body erect, having given up the
duties of the (four) orders of life, having subjugated all the organs,
having saluted his Guru with devotion, having looked upon the heart
(-lotus) as being free from Rajoguṇa and as pure, and having
contemplated in its (heart's) centre Parameśwara who is always with His
consort Ūma, who is pure and free from sorrow, who is unthinkable and
invisible, who is of endless forms, who is of the nature of happiness,

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

who is very quiescent, who is of the form of emancipation, who is the
source of Māyā, who has no beginning, middle or end, who is One, who is
All-Pervading, who is Chiḍānanḍa (Consciousness-Bliss), who is formless,
who is wonderful, who is the Lord (of all), who has three eyes, who has
a blue neck, (Nīlakaṇtha), and who is serenity (itself)—the Muni attains
Paramāṭmā, the womb of all elements, the All-Witness, and above lamas.
He only is Brahma. He only is Śiva. He only is Inḍra. He only is the
indestructible. He only is the Supreme. He only is the Self-Shining. He
only is Vishṇū. He only is Prāṇa. He only is Time. He only is Agni
(fire). He only is the moon. He only is all things that exist or will
hereafter exist. He only is eternal. Having known Him, one crosses
death. There is no other path to salvation. He only attains Parabrahman
who sees in himself all elements and himself in all elements. There is
no other means. Having constituted his body an Araṇi (the lower
attritional piece of wood) and Praṇava (Om), the upper Araṇi, a wise man
burns Ajñāna by the churning of meditation.

"It is only He (Paramāṭmā) who, deluded by Māyā, assumes a body with the
internal organs and does everything. It is only He who in the waking
state is gratified with women, food, drink, and other diverse
enjoyments. In the dreaming state, the Jīva enjoys pleasures and pains
in the several worlds which are created by His Māyā. In the dreamless
sleeping state when all are absorbed, He, replete with Ṭamas, attains
the state of happiness. Then through the force of the Karmas of previous
births, that Jīva again wakes up and goes to sleep. All the diversified
objects (of the universe) emanate from the Jīva, who sports in the three
bodies (gross, subtle and causal). The three bodies are finally absorbed
in Him who is the source of all, who is Bliss, and who is Absolute
Wisdom. From Him, arise Prāṇa, Manas, all the organs of sense and
action, Ākāś, Vāyu, Agni, water and the earth supporting all.
Parabrahman, which is of all forms, which is the Supreme Abode of this
universe, which is the most subtle of the subtle and which is eternal,
is only yourself. You are

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

only That. One who knows himself to be that Parabrahman that shines as
the universe in the waking, dreaming, dreamless and other states, will
be relieved from all bondage. I am that Saḍāśiva, (or the eternal
happiness) who is other than the enjoyer, the enjoyed, and the enjoyment
in the three seats (or bodies), and who is witness and Chinmāṭra. All
emanate from Me alone. All exist in Me alone. All merge into Me alone. I
am that non-dual Brahman. I am the atom of atoms; so am I the biggest
(of all). I am this diversified universe. I am the oldest of all. I am
Purusha. I am Īśa (the Lord). I am of the form of Jyoṭis (light) and of
the form of happiness. I have neither hands nor feet. I have power
unthinkable. I see without eyes. I hear without ears. I am omniscient. I
have one kind of form only. None is able to know Me fully. I am always
of the form of Chiṭ. I am the One that should be known through all the
Veḍas. I am the Guru who revealed the Veḍānṭa. I am only He who knows
the true meaning of Veḍānṭa. I have no sins or virtues. I have no
destruction. I have no birth, body, organs of sense or action, or
Buḍḍhi. To Me there is no earth, water or fire. There is no Vāyu; there
is no Ākāś. He who thinks Paramāṭmā as being in the cave (of the heart),
as having no form, as being secondless, as being the witness of all and
as being neither Saṭ nor Asaṭ, attains the pure form of Paramāṭmā.

"Whoever recites this Upanishaḍ belonging to Yajurveḍa, he becomes as
pure as Agni (fire). He becomes purified from the sins of theft of gold.
He becomes purified from the sins of drinking alcohol. He becomes
purified from the sins of murder of a Brahman. He becomes purified from
the sins of commission (of those that ought not to be done) and the sins
of omission (of those that ought to be done). Therefore he becomes a
follower of Brāhman. Were one who has stepped beyond the duties of the
four orders of life to recite (this Upanishaḍ) always or even once, he
acquires the wisdom that destroys the ocean of Samsāra. Therefore having
known Him, he attains the Kaivalya State (or state of isolation or
emancipation)—yea, he attains the Kaivalya State."
