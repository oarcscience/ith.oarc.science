### NĀRĀYAṆA-UPANISHAḌ

### OF

### KṚSHṆA-YAJURVEḌA

<span class="smallcaps">Om</span>. Then Nārāyaṇa, the supreme Purusha
desired. "I shall create offspring." From Nārāyaṇa emanates prāṇa,
manas, the several organs of sense and action, ākāś, vāyu, agni, āpas
and pṛṭhivī that supports all. From Nārāyaṇa emanates Brahmā. From
Nārāyaṇa emanates Ruḍra. From Nārāyaṇa emanates Inḍra. From Nārāyaṇa
emanates Prajāpaṭi (the divine progenitor). From Nārāyaṇa emanates the
twelve āḍiṭyas, ruḍras, vasus, and all the chhanḍas (Veḍas). From
Nārāyaṇa only do (all these) proceed. Through Nārāyaṇa do (they)
prosper. In Nārāyaṇa (they) are absorbed. The Ṛgveḍa teaches this.

Then Nārāyaṇa is eternal. Brahmā is Nārāyaṇa, Śiva is Nārāyaṇa, Inḍra is
Nārāyaṇa, Kāla (time) is Nārāyaṇa, Ḍik (space) is Nārāyaṇa, the
intermediate quarters also are Nārāyaṇa; that which is above is
Nārāyaṇa, that which is below is Nārāyaṇa, that which is in and out is
Nārāyaṇa, the whole universe which existed and will exist is Nārāyaṇa.
Nārāyaṇa is the only one that is stainless, sinless, changeless, and
unnameable, and that is pure and divine. There is no second. Whoever
knows Him thus, becomes Vishṇu Himself. The Yajurveḍa teaches this.

One should utter "Om" first, then "namaḥ," and then "Nārāyaṇāya." "Om"
(is) a single syllable; "Namaḥ" contains two syllables: "Nārāyaṇāya"
contains five syllables. This is the sentence known as the
Ashtākshara <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_93.md) of Nārāyaṇa.

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Whoever studies
this Ashtākshara of Nārāyaṇa and recites it constantly, attains full
life and supremacy over men, enjoys the pleasures of royalty and becomes
the master of all souls. He attains moksha; yea, he attains moksha. The
Sāmaveḍa teaches this.

The Yogin having pronounced (the name of) Him who is complete bliss, who
is Brahma-purusha and who is of the nature of Praṇava (Om)—a combination
of A, U, and M—is released from the bondage of birth and mundane
existence. He who practises the manṭra "Om-Namo-Nārāyaṇāya" reaches
Vaikuṇtha (the abode of Vishṇu). It is this lotus (heart). It is replete
with vijñāna: It has the brilliancy of lightning. The son of Ḍevākī is
Brahmaṇya <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_94.md). Maḍhusūḍana is Brahmaṇya.
Nārāyaṇa who pervades all elements, who is one only, who is the cause
Purusha and who is causeless, is known as Parabrahman. The Aṭharvaṇa
Upanishaḍ teaches this.

Whoever recites (this Upanishaḍ) in the morning destroys the sins
committed the night (before). Whoever recites it in the evening destroys
the sins committed during the day. Whoever recites morning and evening
becomes free from sins, however sinful he may be. Whoever recites (it)
in the noon facing the sun is freed from all the five <span
id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_95.md) great sins as well as from the minor ones.
He derives the good effects of the recitation of all the Veḍas. Whoever
knows thus attains Sāyujya of Nārāyaṇa (*viz*., is absorbed in the
essence of Nārāyaṇa). He attains Sāyujya of Nārāyaṇa. Thus is the
Upanishaḍ.
