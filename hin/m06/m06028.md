### SECTION XXVIII (Bhagavad Gita Chapter IV)

"The Holy One said,--'This imperishable (system of) devotion I declared
to Vivaswat: Vivaswat declared it to Manu; and Manu communicated it to
Ikshaku. Descending thus from generation, the Royal sages came to know
it. But, O chastiser of foes, by (lapse of a) long time that devotion
became lost to the world. Even the same (system of) devotion hath today
been declared by me to thee, for thou art my devotee and friend, (and)
this is a great mystery.'

"Arjuna said,--'Thy birth is posterior; Vivaswat's birth is prior. How
shall I understand then that thou hadst first declared (it)?'

"The Holy One said,--'Many births of mine have passed away, O Arjuna, as
also of thine. These all I know, but thou dost not, O chastiser of foes.
Though (I am) unborn and of essence that knoweth no deterioration,
though (I am) the lord of all creatures, still, relying on my own
(material) nature I take birth by my own (powers) of illusion. Whenever,
O Bharata, loss of piety and the rise of impiety occurreth, on those
occasions do I create myself. For the protection of the righteous and
for the destruction of the evil doers, for the sake of establishing
Piety, I am born age after age. He who truly knoweth my divine birth and
work to be such, casting off (his body) is not born again; (on the other
hand) he cometh to me, O Arjuna. Many who have been freed from
attachment, fear, wrath, who were full of me, and who relied on me,
have, cleansed by knowledge and asceticism, attained to my essence. In
whatsoever manner men come to me, in the selfsame manner do I accept
them. It is my way, O Partha, that men follow on all sides. <span
id="fr_168"></span>[2](#fn_168.md) Those in this world who are desirous of
the success of action worship the gods, for in this world of men success
resulting from action is soon attained. The quadruple division of castes
was created by me according to the distinction of qualities and duties.
Though I am the

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

author thereof, (yet) know me to be not their author and
undecaying. <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_169.md) Actions do not touch
me. I have no longing for the fruits of actions. He that knoweth me thus
is not impeded by actions. Knowing this, even men of old who were
desirous of emancipation performed work. Therefore, do thou also perform
work as was done by ancients of the remote past. What is action and what
is inaction,--even the learned are perplexed at this. Therefore, I will
tell thee about action (so that) knowing it thou mayst be freed from
evil. One should have knowledge of action, and one should have knowledge
of forbidden actions: one should also know of inaction. The course of
action is incomprehensible. He, who sees inaction in action and action
in inaction, is wise among men; he is possessed of devotion; and he is a
doer of all actions. The learned call him wise whose efforts are all
free from desire (of fruit) and (consequent) will, and whose actions
have all been consumed by the fire of knowledge. <span
id="fr_170"></span>[2](#fn_170.md) Whoever, resigning all attachment to the
fruit of action, is ever contented and is dependent on none, doth
nought, indeed, although engaged in action. He who, without desire, with
mind and the senses under control, and casting off all concerns,
performeth action only for the preservation of the body, incurreth no
sin. <span id="fr_171"></span>[3](#fn_171.md) He who is contented with what
is earned without exertion, who hath risen superior to the pairs of
opposites, who is without jealousy, who is equable in success and
failure, is not fettered (by action) even though he works. All his
actions perish who acts for the sake of sacrifice, <span
id="fr_172"></span>[4](#fn_172.md) who is without affections, who is free
(from attachments), and whose mind is fixed upon knowledge. *Brahma* is
the vessel (with which the libation is poured); *Brahma* is the libation
(that is offered); *Brahma* is the fire on which by *Brahma* is poured
(the libation); *Brahma* is the goal to which he proceedeth by fixing
his mind on *Brahma* itself which is the action. <span
id="fr_173"></span>[5](#fn_173.md) Some devotees perform sacrifice to the
gods. Others, by means of sacrifice, offer up sacrifices to the fire of
*Brahma*. <span id="fr_174"></span>[6](#fn_174.md) Others offer up (as
sacrificial libation) the senses of which hearing is the first to the
fire of restraint. Others (again) offer up (as libations) the objects of
sense of which sound is the first to the fire of the

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

senses. <span id="fr_175"></span>[1](#fn_175) Others (again.md) offer up
all the functions of the senses and the functions of the vital winds to
the fire of devotion by self-restraint kindled by knowledge. <span
id="fr_176"></span>[2](#fn_176.md) Others again perform the sacrifice of
wealth, the sacrifice of ascetic austerities, the sacrifice of
meditation, the sacrifice of (*Vedic*) study, the sacrifice of
knowledge, and others are ascetics of rigid vows. <span
id="fr_177"></span>[3](#fn_177.md) Some offer up the upward vital wind
(Prana) to the downward vital wind (apana); and others, the downward
vital wind to the upward vital wind; some, arresting the course of
(both) the upward and the downward vital winds, are devoted to the
restraint of the vital winds. Others of restricted rations, offer the
vital winds to the vital winds. <span id="fr_178"></span>[4](#fn_178.md)
Even all these who are conversant with sacrifice, whose sins have been
consumed by sacrifice, and who eat the remnants of sacrifice which are
*amrita*, attain to the eternal Brahma. (Even) this world is not for him
who doth not perform sacrifice. Whence then the other, O best of Kuru's
race? Thus diverse are the sacrifices occurring in the *Vedas*. Know
that all of them result from action, and knowing this thou wilt be
emancipated. The sacrifice of knowledge, O chastiser of foes, is
superior to every sacrifice involving (the attainment of) fruits of
action, for all action, O Partha, is wholly comprehended in
knowledge. <span id="fr_179"></span>[5](#fn_179) Learn that (Knowledge.md)
by prostration, enquiry, and service. They who are possessed of
knowledge and can see the truth, will teach thee that knowledge, knowing
which, O son of Pandu, thou wilt not again come by such delusion, and by
which thou wilt see the endless creatures (of the universe) in thyself
(first) and then in me. Even if thou be the greatest sinner among all
that are sinful, thou shalt yet cross over all transgressions by the
raft of knowledge. As a blazing fire, O Arjuna, reduceth fuel to ashes,
so doth the fire of knowledge reduce all actions to ashes. For there is
nothing here that is so cleansing as knowledge. One who hath attained to
success by devotion finds it without effort within his own self in time.
He obtaineth knowledge, who hath faith and is intent on it and who hath
his senses under control; obtaining knowledge one findeth the highest
tranquillity in no length of time. One who hath no knowledge and no
faith, and whose minds is full of doubt, is lost. Neither this world,
nor the next, nor happiness, is for him whose mind is full of doubt.
Actions do not fetter him, O Dhananjaya, who hath cast off action by
devotion, whose doubts have been dispelled by knowledge, and who is
self-restrained. Therefore, destroying, by the sword of knowledge,

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

this doubt of thine that is born of ignorance and that dwelleth in thy
mind, betake to devotion, (and) arise, O son of Bharata.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_168"></span>[62:2](m06028.htm#fr_168.md) There can be little
doubt that what Krishna says here is that no form of worship is
unacceptable to him. Whatever the manner of the worship, it is I who is
worshipped. After K. T. Telang's exhaustive and effective reply to Dr.
Lorinser's strange hypothesis of the Gita having been composed under
Christian influences, it is scarcely necessary to add that such
toleration would ill accord with the theory of the Christian authorship
of the poem.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[63:1](m06028.htm#fr_169.md) *i.e.*, both inactive
and undecaying. Work implies exertion, and, therefore, loss of energy.
In me there is no action, no loss of energy and therefore, no decay.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[63:2](m06028.htm#fr_170.md) '*Kama-sankalpa
vivarjjitas*.' *i.e.*, freed from *kama* (desire of fruit) and
*sankalpa*--the consequent will or determination to do. Thus both
Sreedhara and Sankara.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[63:3](m06028.htm#fr_171.md) *Chitta* the mind and
*atma* in this connection is the senses. Thus both Sreedhara and
Sankara.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[63:4](m06028.htm#fr_172.md) Sacrifice means here
the Supreme Soul. What is done for the sake of sacrifice is done for
procuring emancipation.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[63:5](m06028.htm#fr_173.md) What is meant by this
is that in the case of such a person complete identification with Brahma
takes place, and when such an identification has taken place, action is
destroyed.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[63:6](m06028.htm#fr_174.md) *I.e.*, offering up
sacrifice itself as a sacrifice to the Brahma fire, they cast off all
action.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[64:1](m06028.htm#fr_175.md) Offering up the
senses to the fire of restraint means restraining the senses for the
practice of *Yoga*. Offering up the objects of the senses means
non-attachment to those objects.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[64:2](m06028.htm#fr_176.md) Suspending the
functions of life for contemplation or *Yoga*.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[64:3](m06028.htm#fr_177.md) In these cases the
sacrifices consist in the giving away of wealth, in the ascetic
austerities themselves, in meditation, in study, *etc*. Sreedhara
explains the first compound of the second line differently. According to
him, it means not study and knowledge, but the knowledge from study.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[64:4](m06028.htm#fr_178.md) All these are
different kinds of *Yoga*, or the different stages of Yoga practice.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[64:5](m06028.htm#fr_179.md) *i.e.*, knowledge
being attained, the fruits of action are attained by, at least, their
end being compassed.
