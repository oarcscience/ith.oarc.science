### SECTION XXIII

Sanjaya said,--"Beholding the Dhartarashtra army approach for fight,
Krishna said these words for Arjuna's benefit."

"The holy one said,--'Cleansing thyself, O mighty-armed one, utter on
the eve of the battle thy hymn to Durga for (compassing) the defeat of
the foe."

Sanjaya continued.--Thus addressed on the eve of battle by Vasudeva
endued with great intelligence, Pritha's son Arjuna, alighting from his
car, said the following hymn with joined hands.

"Arjuna said,--'I bow to thee, O leader of *Yogins*, O thou that art
identical with *Brahman*, O thou that dwellest in the forest of Mandara,
O thou that art freed from decrepitude and decay, O Kali, O wife of
*Kapala*, O thou that art of a black and tawny hue, I bow to thee. O
bringer of benefits to thy devotees, I bow to thee, O *Mahakali*, O wife
of the universal destroyer, I bow to thee. O proud one, O thou that
rescuest from dangers, O thou that art endued with every auspicious
attribute. O thou that art sprung from the *Kata* race, O thou that
deservest the most regardful worship, O fierce one, O giver of victory,
O victory's self, O thou that bearest a banner of peacock plumes, O thou
that art decked with every ornament, O thou that bearest an awful spear,
O thou that holdest a sword and shield, O thou that art the younger
sister of the chief of cow-herds, O eldest one, O thou that wert born in
the race of the cowherd Nanda! O thou that art always fond of buffalo's
blood, O thou that wert born in the race of *Kusika*, O thou that art
dressed in yellow robes, O thou that

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

hadst devoured *Asuras* assuming the face of a wolf <span
id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119.md), I bow to thee that art fond of battle!
O *Uma*, <span id="fr_120"></span>[2](#fn_120.md) *Sakambhari*, O thou that
art white in hue, O thou that art black in hue, O thou that hast slain
the *Asura* Kaitabha, O thou that art yellow-eyed, O thou that art
diverse-eyed, O thou of eyes that have the colour of smoke, I bow to
thee. O thou that art the *Vedas*, the *Srutis*, and the highest virtue,
O thou that art propitious to Brahmanas engaged in sacrifice, O thou
that hast a knowledge of the past, thou that art ever present in the
sacred abodes erected to thee in cities of Jamvudwipa, I bow to thee.
Thou art the science of Brahma among sciences, and thou that art that
sleep of creatures from which there is no waking. O mother of Skanda, O
thou that possessest the six (highest) attributes, O Durga, O thou that
dwellest in accessible regions, thou art described as *Swaha*, and
*Swadha*, <span id="fr_121"></span>[3](#fn_121.md) as *Kala*, as *Kashta*,
and as *Saraswati*, as *Savitra* the mother of the *Vedas*, and as the
science of *Vedanta*. With inner soul cleansed, I praise thee. O great
goddess, let victory always attend me through thy grace on the field of
battle. In inaccessible regions, where there is fear, in places of
difficulty, in the abodes of thy worshippers and in the nether regions
(*Patala*), thou always dwellest. Thou always defeatest the *Danavas*.
Thou art the unconsciousness, the sleep, the illusion, the modesty, the
beauty of (all creatures). Thou art the twilight, thou art the day, thou
art *Savitri*, and thou art the mother. Thou art contentment, thou art
growth, thou art light. It is thou that supportest the Sun and the Moon
and that makes them shine. Thou art the prosperity of those that are
prosperous. The *Siddhas* and the *Charanas* behold thee in
contemplation. <span id="fr_122"></span>[4](#fn_122.md)'"

Sanjaya continued,--Understanding (the measure of) Partha's devotion,
Durga who is always graciously inclined towards mankind, appeared in the
firmament and in the presence of Govinda, said these words.

'"The goddess said,--'Within a short time thou shalt conquer thy foes, O
Pandava. O invincible one, thou hast Narayana (again) for aiding thee.
Thou art incapable of being defeated by foes, even by the wielder of the
thunderbolt himself.'

'"Having said this, the boon-giving goddess disappeared soon. The son of
Kunti, however, obtaining that boon, regarded himself as successful, and
the son of Pritha then mounted his own excellent car. And then Krishna
and Arjuna, seated on the same car, blew their celestial conches. The
man that recites this hymn rising at dawn, hath no fear any time from

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *Yakshas*, *Rakshasas*, and *Pisachas*. He can
have no enemies; he hath no fear, from snakes and all animals that have
fangs and teeth, as also from kings. He is sure to be victorious in all
disputes, and if bound, he is freed from his bonds. He is sure to get
over all difficulties, is freed from thieves, is ever victorious in
battle and winneth the goddess of prosperity for ever. With health and
strength, he liveth for a hundred years.

"I have known all this through the grace of Vyasa endued with great
wisdom. Thy wicked sons, however, all entangled in the meshes of death,
do not, from ignorance, know them to be Nara and Narayana. Nor do they,
entangled in the meshes of death, know that the hour of this kingdom
hath arrived. Dwaipayana and Narada, and Kanwa, and the sinless Rama,
had all prevented thy son. But he did not accept their words. There
where righteousness is, there are glory and beauty. There where modesty
is, there are prosperity and intelligence. There where righteousness is,
there is Krishna; and there where Krishna is, there is victory."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_119"></span>[49:1](m06023.htm#fr_119.md) follow Nilakantha in
rendering many of the names occurring in this and the succeeding slokas.
I retain, however, those names that are of doubtful etymology, as also
those that are very common.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[49:2](m06023.htm#fr_120.md) Every scholar knows
the derivation of this word as given in this *sloka* of Kalidasa (in his
*Kumara Sambhavam*) *Umeti matra tapasonishiddha paschadumakhyam Sumukhi
Jagama*.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[49:3](m06023.htm#fr_121.md) Both *Swaha* and
*Swadha* are mantras of high efficacy. *Kala* and *Kastha* are divisions
of time. *Saraswati* implies speech.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[49:4](m06023.htm#fr_122.md) *Sankhye* is
explained by Nilakantha to be *Samyak Khyanam Prakasana Yasmin*; hence
*Atmanatma-vivekarupa Samadhi*.
