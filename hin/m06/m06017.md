### SECTION XVII

Sanjaya said,--"Just as the holy Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa had said, in
that very manner the kings of the Earth, mustered together, came to the
encounter. On that day on which the battle commenced Soma

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

approached the region of *Pitris*. <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91.md)
The seven large planets, as they appeared in the firmament, all looked
blazing like fire. <span id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_92.md) The Sun, when he
rose, seemed to be divided in twain. Besides, that luminary, as it
appeared in the firmament, seemed to blaze forth in flames. <span
id="fr_93"></span>[3](#fn_93.md) Carnivorous jackals and crows, expecting
dead bodies to feast upon, began to utter fierce cries from all
directions that seemed to be ablaze. Every day the old grandsire of the
Kurus, and the son of Bharadwaja, rising from bed in the morning, with
concentrated mind, said,--'Victory to the sons of Pandu'--while those
chastisers of foes used (at the same time) yet to fight for thy sake
according to the pledge they had given. Thy father Devavrata, fully
conversant with every duty, summoning all the kings, said these words
(unto them). 'Ye Kshatriyas, this broad door is open to you for entering
heaven. Go ye through it to the region of Sakra and *Brahman*. The
*Rishis* of olden times have showed you this eternal path. <span
id="fr_94"></span>[4](#fn_94.md) Honour ye yourselves by engaging in battle
with attentive minds. Nabhaga, and Yayati, and Mandhatri, and Nahusa,
and Nriga, were crowned with success and obtained the highest region of
bliss by feats like these. To die of disease at home is sin for a
Kshatriya. The death he meets with in battle is his eternal duty.'--Thus
addressed, O bull of Bharata's race, by Bhishma, the kings, looking
beautiful in their excellent cars, proceeded to the heads of their
respective divisions. Only Vikartana's son Karna, with his friends and
relatives, O bull of Bharata's race, laid aside his weapons in battle
for the sake of Bhishma. Without Karna then, thy sons and all the kings
on thy side proceeded, making the ten points of the horizon resound with
their leonine roars. And their divisions shone brightly, O king, with
white umbrellas, banners, standards, elephants, steeds, cars, and
foot-soldiers. And the Earth was agitated with the sounds of drums and
tabors and

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

cymbals, and the clatter of car-wheels. And the mighty car-warriors,
decked with their bracelets and armlets of gold and with their bows
(variegated with gold), looked resplendent like hills of fire. And with
his large palmyra-standard decked with five stars, Bhishma, the
generalissimo of the Kuru army, <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md)
looked like the resplendent Sun himself. Those mighty bowmen of royal
birth, O bull of Bharata's race, that were on thy side, all took up
their positions, O king, as Santanu's son ordered. (King) Saivya of the
country of the Govasanas, accompanied by all the monarchs, went out on a
princely elephant worthy of royal use and graced with a banner on its
back. And Aswatthaman, of the complexion of the lotus, went out ready
for every emergency, stationing himself at the very head of all the
divisions, with his standard bearing the device of the lion's tail. And
Srutayudha and Chitrasena and Purumitra and Vivinsati, and Salya and
Bhurisravas, and that mighty car-warrior Vikarna,--these seven mighty
bowmen on their carts and cased in excellent mail, followed Drona's son
behind but in advance of Bhishma. The tall standards of these warriors,
made of gold, beautifully set up for adorning their excellent cars,
looked highly resplendent. The standard of Drona, the foremost of
preceptors, bore the device of a golden altar decked with a water-pot
and the figure of a bow. The standard of Duryodhana guiding many
hundreds and thousands of divisions bore the device of an elephant
worked in gems. Paurava and the ruler of the Kalingas, and Salya, these
Rathas took up their position in Duryodhana's van. On a costly car with
his standard bearing the device of a bull, and guiding the very van (of
his division), the ruler of the Magadhas marched against the foe. <span
id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_96.md) That large force of the Easterners looking
like the fleecy clouds of autumn <span id="fr_97"></span>[3](#fn_97.md) was
(besides) protected by the chief of the Angas (Karna's son Vrishaketu)
and Kripa endued with great energy. Stationing himself in the van of his
division with his beautiful standard of silver bearing the device of the
boar, the famous Jayadratha looked highly resplendent. A hundred
thousand cars, eight thousand elephants, and sixty thousand cavalry were
under his command. <span id="fr_98"></span>[4](#fn_98.md) Commanded by the
royal chief of the Sindhus, that large division occupying the very van
(of the army) and abounding with untold cars, elephants, and steeds,
looked magnificent. With sixty thousand cars and ten thousand elephants,
the ruler of the Kalingas, accompanied by Ketumat, went out. His huge
elephants, looking like hills, and

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

adorned with *Yantras*, <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_99.md) lances,
quivers and standards, looked exceedingly beautiful. And the ruler of
the Kalingas, with his tall standard effulgent as fire, with his white
umbrella, and golden curass, and *Chamaras* (wherewith he was fanned),
shone brilliantly. And Ketumat also, riding on an elephant with a highly
excellent and beautiful hook, was stationed in battle, O King, like the
Sun in the midst of (black) clouds. And king Bhagadatta, blazing with
energy and riding on that elephant of his, went out like the wielder of
the thunder. And the two princes of Avanti named Vinda and Anuvinda, who
were regarded as equal to Bhagadatta, followed Ketumat, riding on the
necks of their elephants. And, O king, arrayed by Drona and the royal
son of Santanu, and Drona's son, and Valhika, and Kripa, the (Kaurava)
*Vyuha* <span id="fr_100"></span>[2](#fn_100.md) consisting of many
divisions of cars was such that the elephants formed its body; the
kings, its head; and the steeds, its wings. With face towards all sides,
that fierce Vyuha seemed to smile and ready to spring (upon the foe)."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_91"></span>[38:1](m06017.htm#fr_91.md) Nilakantha in a long
note explains that *Magha Vishayagas Somas* cannot mean that *Soma* or
the Moon entered the constellation called *Magha*. He quotes numerous
slokas scattered throughout the Mahabharata that throw light, directly
or indirectly, on the question of the opening day of the battle, and
shows that all these lead to a different conclusion. What is meant by
the Moon approaching the region of the *Pitris* is that those who fall
in battle immediately ascend to heaven; of course, they have first to go
to the region of *Pitris*. Thence they have to go to the lunar region
for obtaining celestial bodies. All this implies a little delay. Here,
however, in the case of those that would fall on the field of
Kurukshetra, they would not have to incur even such a little delay.
*Chandramas* or *Soma* approached the region of *Pitris* so that the
fallen warriors might have celestial bodies very soon, without, in fact,
any necessity, on their part, to incur the delay of a journey to the
lunar region prior to their ascension to heaven with resplendent bodies.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[38:2](m06017.htm#fr_92.md) There are nine planets
in all the Pauranic astronomy. Of these Rahu and Ketu are regarded
*Upagrahas*, and hence, of *grahas* there are only seven. Thus
Nilakantha, and the Burdwan pundits have made a mess of this line.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[38:3](m06017.htm#fr_93.md) The Bengal texts read
*Bhanumanudito divi*. The Bombay reading is *Bhanumanudito Ravis*. If
the latter be adopted, *Bhanuman* would be an adjective of *Ravis*.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[38:4](m06017.htm#fr_94.md) *Purvais Purvatarais*
is literally--"They of old and still older times"; for *Sanatanas* some
editions read *Srutijas* (qualifying panthas). *Srutija* means arising
from the *Srutis* or as laid down in the Srutis.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[39:1](m06017.htm#fr_95.md) *Chamupatis* is the
Bengal reading. The Bombay text reads *Chamupari*. If the latter reading
be adopted, the meaning would be, "at the head of the (Kuru) army."

<span id="fn_96"></span>[39:2](m06017.htm#fr_96.md) The Bengal editions
read '*Magadhascha ripum yayau*.' The Bombay text reads '*Magadhasya
Kripo-yayau*.' If the latter reading be adopted, the meaning would be
"and guiding the very van of the Magadha troops Kripa went."

<span id="fn_97"></span>[39:3](m06017.htm#fr_97.md) The Bengal reading is
*Saradabhraghana-prakshyam*. The Bombay reading is
'*Sharadamvudhara-prakshyam*.'

<span id="fn_98"></span>[39:4](m06017.htm#fr_98.md) *Vasavartinas* is
nominative, masculine, plural, referring to cars, &c.; the Burdwan
Pundits take it as a [genitive](errata.htm#0.md) singular qualifying
*tasya*, and they render it, therefore, as "of that subordinate of
Duryodhana." This is evidently incorrect.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[40:1](m06017.htm#fr_99.md) Machines, perhaps
catapults.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[40:2](m06017.htm#fr_100.md) '*Vyuha*' is an array
of troops in a certain form. Many such will be spoken of in this and the
other '*parvas*' devoted to the battle.
