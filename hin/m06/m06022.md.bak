### SECTION XXII

Sanjaya said,--"Then, O bull of Bharata's race, king Yudhishthira,
disposing his own troops in counter array against the divisions of
Bhishma, urged them on, saying,--'The Pandavas have now disposed their
forces in counter array agreeably to what is laid down (in the
scriptures). Ye sinless ones, fight fairly, desirous of (entering) the
highest heaven'.--In the centre (of the Pandava army) was Sikhandin and
his troops, protected by Arjuna. And Dhristadyumna moved in the van,
protected by Bhima. The southern division (of the Pandava army) was
protected. O king, by that mighty bowman, the handsome Yuyudhana, that
foremost combatant of the Satwata race, resembling Indra himself.
Yudhisthira was stationed on a car that was worthy of bearing Mahendra
himself, adorned with an excellent standard, variegated with gold and
gems, and furnished with golden traces (for the steeds), in the midst of
his elephant divisions. <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md) His pure
white umbrella with ivory handle, raised over his head, looked
exceedingly beautiful; and many great *Rishis* walked around the
king <span id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114.md) uttering words in his praise.
And many priests, and regenerate *Rishis* and *Siddhas*, uttering hymns
in his praise <span id="fr_115"></span>[3](#fn_115.md) wished him, as they
walked around, the destructions of his enemies, by the aid of *Japas*,
and *Mantras*, efficacious drugs, and diverse propitiatory ceremonies.
That high-souled chief of the Kurus, then giving away unto the Brahmanas
kine and fruits and flowers and golden coins along with cloths <span
id="fr_116"></span>[4](#fn_116.md) proceeded like Sakra, the chief of the
celestials. The car of Arjuna, furnished with a hundred bells, decked
with *Jamvunada* gold of the best kind, endued with excellent wheels,
possessed of the effulgence of fire, and unto which were yoked white
steeds, looked exceedingly brilliant like a thousand suns. <span
id="fr_117"></span>[5](#fn_117.md) And on that ape-bannered car the reins
of which were held by Kesava, stood Arjuna with *Gandiva* and arrows in
hand--a bowman whose peer exists not on earth, nor ever will. <span
id="fr_118"></span>[6](#fn_118.md) For crushing thy sons' troops he who
assumeth the most awful form,--who, divested of weapons, with only

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

his bare hands, poundeth to dust men, horses, and elephants,--that
strong-armed Bhimasena, otherwise called Vrikodara, accompanied by the
twins, became the protector of the heroic car-warriors (of the Pandava)
army. Like unto a furious prince of lions of sportive gait, or like the
great Indra himself with (earthly) body on the Earth, beholding that
invincible Vrikodara, like unto a proud leader of an elephantine herd,
stationed in the van (of the army), the warriors on thy side, their
strength weakened by fear, began to tremble like elephants sunk in mire.

"Unto that invincible prince Gudakesa staying in the midst of his
troops, Janardana, O chief of Bharata's race, said--He, who scorching us
with his wrath, stayeth in the midst of his forces, he, who will attack
our troops like a lion, he, who performed three hundred
horse-sacrifices,--that banner of Kuru's race, that Bhishma,--stayeth
yonder! Yon ranks around him on all sides great warriors like the clouds
shrouding the bright luminary. O foremost of men, slaying yon troops,
seek battle with yonder bull of Bharata's race."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_113"></span>[47:1](m06022.htm#fr_113.md) The Bengal texts read
*Kanchana-bhanda-yuktam*. The Bombay reading is much better, being
*Kanchanabhanda-yoktam*; again, for *Nagakulasya* the Bombay edition
reads *Nagapurasya*, Nilakantha notices the latter reading.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[47:2](m06022.htm#fr_114.md) The Bengal reading is
*Mahindram* (king of earth, or king); the Bombay reading is *Mahendram*
(the great Indra). Without *iva* any word to that effect, *Mahendram*
would be ungrammatical.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[47:3](m06022.htm#fr_115.md) The Bengal texts
read, and as I think, correctly, *Stutavanta enam*. The Bombay reading
is *Srutavanta enam*. In the case of regenerate *Rishis* and *Siddhas*
it is scarcely necessary to say that they are conversant with the
*Srutis*.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[47:4](m06022.htm#fr_116.md) The Bengal reading
*Sahasrani* for *Savastrani* is correct. I adopt the latter,

<span id="fn_117"></span>[47:5](m06022.htm#fr_117.md) This is how I
understand this verse, and I am supported by the Burdwan Pundits.
Nilakantha, it seems, thinks that the car had a thousand wheels
resembling a thousand suns.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[47:6](m06022.htm#fr_118.md) Verse 15 is read
variously. As the last word of the first line, I read *Achakarsha* for
*raraksha*, and accordingly I take that as a [genitive](errata.htm#1.md)
and not an ablative particle.
