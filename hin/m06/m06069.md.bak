### SECTION LXIX

Sanjaya said, "After the night had passed away and the sun had risen,
the two armies, O king, approached each other for battle. Beholding each
other, each rushed in united ranks towards the other excited with rage
and desirous of vanquishing the other. And in consequence of thy evil
policy, O king, the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras thus rushed, cased
in mail and forming battle-array, for striking each other. And the array
that Bhishma protected from all sides, O king, was of the shape of a
*Makara*. <span id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_390.md) And so the Pandavas
also, O king, protected the array they had formed (of their troops).
Then thy sire Devavrata, O great king, that foremost of car-warriors,
proceeded in advance, supported by a large division of cars. And others,
*viz.*, car-warriors, infantry, elephants, and cavalry, all followed
him, each stationed in the place allotted. And beholding them prepared
for battle, the illustrious sons of Pandu arrayed their troops in that
invincible and prince of arrays called the *Syena*. <span
id="fr_391"></span>[2](#fn_391.md) And in the beak of that array shone
Bhimasena of great strength. And in its two eyes were the invincible
Sikhandin and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata's race. And in the head was the
heroic Satyaki of prowess incapable of being baffled. And in its neck
was Arjuna shaking his Gandiva. And in its left wing was the high-souled
and blessed Drupada with his son and supported by an *akshauhini* of all
forces. And the king of the Kekayas, owning an *akshauhini*, formed

the right wing (of that array). And in its back were the sons of
Draupadi, and Subhadra's son of great prowess. And in its tail was the
heroic king Yudhishthira himself, of excellent prowess, supported by his
twin brothers. Then in the battle (that ensued). Bhima, penetrating the
Makara array (of the Kauravas) through its mouth, and approaching
Bhishma, covered him with his shafts. Then in that great battle, Bhishma
possessed of great prowess shot his mighty weapons, confounding the
combatants of the Pandavas disposed in battle-array. And when the
combatants (of the Pandava army) were thus confounded, Dhananjaya,
speedily proceeding, pierced Bhishma at the van of battle with a
thousand arrows. And counteracting, in that conflict, the weapons shot
by Bhishma, Arjuna stood ready for the combat, supported by his own
division filled with cheerfulness. <span id="fr_392"></span>[1](#fn_392.md)
Then king Duryodhana, that foremost of mighty men, that great
car-warrior, beholding that terrible carnage of his troops and
remembering the slaughter of his brothers (on the previous day), came
quickly towards Bharadwaja's son, and addressing him, said, 'O
preceptor, O sinless one, thou art ever my well-wisher,--Relying on thee
as also on the grandsire Bhishma, ourselves, hope to vanquish without
doubt the very gods in battle, let alone the sons of Pandu that are
destitute of energy and prowess. Blessed be thou, act in such away that
the Pandavas may be slain. Thus addressed in battle by thy son, Drona
penetrated into the Pandava array in the very sight of Satyaki. Then O
Bharata, Satyaki checked the son of Bharadwaja, (and thereupon) ensued a
battle that was fierce in its incidents and awful to behold. Then
Bharadwaja's son excited with rage and endued with great prowess, as if
smiling the while, pierced the grandson of Sini with ten shafts at his
shoulder-joint. And Bhimasena also, excited with rage, pierced
Bharadwaja's son (with many shafts), desirous of protecting Satyaki, O
king, from Drona that foremost of all warriors. Then Drona and Bhishma,
and Salya also, O sire, excited with rage, covered Bhimasena, in that
battle, with their shafts. Thereupon Abhimanyu excited with wrath, and
the sons of Draupadi, O sire, pierced with their sharp-pointed shafts
all those warriors with upraised weapons. Then in that fierce battle,
the great bowman Sikhandin rushed against those two mighty warriors,
*viz.*, Bhishma and Drona who, excited with rage, had (thus) fallen upon
the Pandavas. Firmly grasping his bow whose twang resembled the roar of
the clouds, that hero, shrouding the very Sun with his arrows, quickly
covered his antagonists therewith. The grandsire of the Bharatas,
however, getting Sikhandin before him, avoided him, remembering the
[femininity](errata.htm#4.md) of his sex. Then, O king, urged by thy son,
Drona rushed to battle, desirous of protecting Bhishma in that stress.
Sikhandin, however, approaching Drona that foremost of all wielders of
weapons, avoided, from fear, that warrior resembling the blazing fire
that appears at the end of the Yuga.

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Then, O king, thy son with a large force,
desirous of winning great glory, proceeded to protect Bhishma. And the
Pandavas also proceeded, O king, firmly setting their hearts upon
victory, and the battle then that took place between the combatants of
both armies desirous of victory and fame, was fierce and highly
wonderful, resembling that (in days of yore) between the gods and
Danavas.
