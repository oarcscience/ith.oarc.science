# THE MAHABHARATA

## BHISHMA PARVA

### SECTION I

(*Jamvu-khanda Nirmana Parva*)

OM! HAVING BOWED down to Narayana, and Nara, the most exalted of male
beings, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word 'Jaya' be
uttered.

Janamejaya said,--"How did those heroes, the Kurus, the Pandavas, and
the Somakas, and the high-souled kings assembled together from various
countries, fight?"

Vaisampayana said,--"Listen thou, O lord of the earth, how those
heroes,--the Kurus, the Pandavas, and the Somakas,--fought on the sacred
plain of the Kurukshetra. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) Entering
Kurukshetra, the Pandavas endued with great might, along with the
Somakas, advanced, desirous of victory, against the Kauravas.
Accomplished in the study of the *Vedas*, all (of them) took great
delight in battle. Expectant of success in battle, with their troops
(they) faced the fight. Approaching the army of Dhritarashtra's son,
those (warriors) invincible in battle <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md)
stationed themselves with their troops on the western part (of the
plain), their faces turned towards the east. Yudhishthira, the son of
Kunti, caused tents by thousands to be set up according to rule, beyond
the region called Samantapanchaka. The whole earth seemed then to be
empty, divested of horses and men, destitute of cars and elephants, and
with only the children and the old left (at home). From the whole area
of *Jamvudwipa* over which the sun sheds his rays, <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) was collected that force, O best of kings.
Men of all races, <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) assembled together,
occupied an area extending for many *Yojanas* over districts, rivers,
hills, and woods. That bull among men, king Yudhishthira, ordered
excellent food and other articles of enjoyment for all of them along
with their animals. And Yudhishthira fixed diverse watch-words for them;
so that one saying this should be known as belonging to the Pandavas.
And that descendant of Kuru's race also settled names and badges for all
of them for recognition during time of battle.

"Beholding the standard-top of Pritha's son, the high-souled son of

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Dhritarashtra, with a white umbrella held over
his head, in the midst of a thousand elephants, and surrounded by his
century of brothers, began with all the kings (on his side) to array his
troops against the son of Pandu. Seeing Duryodhana, the Panchalas who
took delight in battle, were filled with joy and blew their
loud-sounding conches and cymbals of sweet sounds. Beholding those
troops so delighted, Pandu's son and Vasudeva of great energy had their
hearts filled with joy. And those tigers among men, Vasudeva and
Dhananjaya, seated on one car, having felt great joy, both blew their
celestial conches. And hearing the blare of *Gigantea* and the loud
blast of *Theodotes* belonging unto the two, the combatants ejected
urine and excreta. As other animals are filled with fear on hearing the
voice of the roaring lion, even so became that force upon hearing those
blasts. A frightful dust arose and nothing could be seen, for the sun
himself, suddenly enveloped by it, seemed to have set. <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) A black cloud poured a shower of flesh and
blood over the troops all around. All this seemed extraordinary. A wind
rose there, bearing along the earth myriads of stony nodules, and
afflicting therewith the combatants by hundreds and thousands. (For all
that), O monarch, both armies, filled with joy, stood addrest for
battle, on Kurukshetra like two agitated oceans. Indeed, that encounter
of the two armies was highly wonderful, like that of two oceans when the
end of the *Yuga* is arrived. The whole earth was empty, having only the
children and the old left (at home), in consequence of that large army
mustered by the Kauravas. <span id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5.md) Then the
Kurus, the Pandavas, and the Somakas made certain covenants, and settled
the rules, O bull of Bharata's race, regarding the different kinds of
combat. Persons equally circumstanced must encounter each other,
fighting fairly. And if having fought fairly the combatants withdraw
(without fear of molestation), even that would be gratifying to us.
Those who engaged in contests of words should be fought against with
words. Those that left the ranks should never be slain. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[3](#fn_6.md) A car-warrior should have a car-warrior for
his antagonist; he on the neck of an elephant should have a similar
combatant for his foe; a horse should be met by a horse, and a
foot-soldier, O Bharata; should be met by a foot-soldier. Guided by
considerations of fitness, willingness, daring and might, one should
strike another, giving notice. No one should strike another that is
unprepared <span id="fr_7"></span>[4](#fn_7.md) or panic-struck. One
engaged with another, one seeking quarter, one retreating, one whose
weapon is rendered unfit, uncased in mail, should never be struck.
Car-drivers, animals (yoked to cars or carrying weapons) men

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

engaged in the transport of weapons, <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)
players on drums and blowers of conches should never be struck. Having
made these covenants, the Kurus, and the Pandavas, and the Somakas
wondered much, gazing at each other. And having stationed (their forces
thus), those bulls among men, those high-souled ones, with their troops,
became glad at heart, their joy being reflected on their countenances."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[1:1](m06001.htm#fr_0.md) *Tapas-kshetra* because
Kuru, the common ancestor of the rival houses, performed his ascetic
austerities there. Since Kuru's time, many ascetics took up their abode
there.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[1:2](m06001.htm#fr_1.md) Some texts have
*Duddharsham* for *Durddharshas*.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[1:3](m06001.htm#fr_2.md) Literally, "gives heat".

<span id="fn_3"></span>[1:4](m06001.htm#fr_3.md) 'Varna' is used here in
the sense of races and not castes.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[2:1](m06001.htm#fr_4.md) This sloka is variously
read. For *bhauman* in the first line some texts read *bhimam* which I
have adopted. For *sahasa* in the second line some texts have *rajasa*,
and then *aditye* (locative) for 'adityas'.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[2:2](m06001.htm#fr_5.md) The Bombay text is
evidently faulty here; it repeats the second half of the 7th sloka,
making the second half of the 25th the first half of the 24th.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[2:3](m06001.htm#fr_6.md) *i.e.*, stragglers should
not be slain.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[2:4](m06001.htm#fr_7.md) Literally, "confiding."

<span id="fn_8"></span>[3:1](m06001.htm#fr_8.md) The Bombay text has
*Castropanayishu*; the Bengal texts have *Castropojibishu*.
