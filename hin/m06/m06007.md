### SECTION VII

"Dhritarashtra said,--'Tell me, O Sanjaya, thou of great intelligence,
of the regions to the north and the east side of Meru, as also of the
mountains of Malyavat, in detail. <span id="fr_49"></span>[3](#fn_49.md)

"Sanjaya said,--'On the south of the Nila mountain and the northern side
of Meru are the sacred *Northern Kurus*, O king, which are the residence
of the *Siddhas*. The trees there bear sweet fruits, and are always
covered with fruits and flowers. All the flowers (there) are fragrant,
and the fruits of excellent taste. Some of the trees, again, O king,
yield fruits according to (the) will (of the plucker). There are again
some other trees, O king, that

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

are called *milk-yielding*. These always yield milk and the six
different kinds of food of the taste of *Amrita* itself. Those trees
also yield cloths and in their fruits are ornaments (for the use of
man). The entire land abounds with fine golden sands. A portion of the
region there, extremely delightful, is seen to be possessed of the
radiance of the ruby or diamond, or of the *lapis lazuli* or other
jewels and gems. <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md) All the seasons
there are agreeable and nowhere does the land become miry, O king. The
tanks are charming, delicious, and full of crystal water. The men born
there have dropped from the world of the celestials. <span
id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_51.md) All are of pure birth and all are
extremely handsome in appearance. There twins (of opposite sexes) are
born and the women resemble *Apsaras* in beauty. They drink the milk,
sweet as *Amrita*, of those milk-yielding trees (already mentioned). And
the twins born there (of opposite sexes) grow up equally. Both possessed
of equal beauty, both endued with similar virtues, and both equally
dressed, both grow up in love, O monarch, like a couple of
*chakrabakas*. The people of that country are free from illness and are
always cheerful. Ten thousand and ten hundred years they live, O king,
and never abandon one another. A class of birds called *Bharunda*,
furnished with sharp beaks and possessed of great strength, take them up
when dead and throw them into mountain caves. I have now described to
thee, O king, the Northern Kurus briefly.

"I will now describe to thee the eastern side of Meru duly. Of all the
regions there, the foremost, O king, is called Bhadraswa, where there is
a large forest of *Bhadra-salas*, as also a huge tree called *Kalamra*.
This *Kalamra*, O king, is always graced with fruits and flowers. That
tree again is a *Yojana* in height and is adored by *Siddhas* <span
id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_52.md) and the *Charanas*. The men there are all
of a white complexion, endued with great energy, and possessed of great
strength. The women are of the complexion of lilies, very beautiful, and
agreeable to sight. Possessed of radiance of the moon, <span
id="fr_53"></span>[4](#fn_53.md) and white as the moon, their faces are as
the full-moon. Their bodies again are as cool as the rays of the moon
and they are all accomplished in singing and dancing. The period of
human life there, O bull of the Bharata's race, is ten thousand years.
Drinking the juice of the *Kalamra* they continue youthful for ever. On
the south of Nila and the north of Nishadha, there is a huge *Jamvu*
tree that is eternal. Adored by the Siddhas and Charanas, that sacred
tree granteth every wish. After the name of that tree this division hath
ever been called *Jamvudwipa*. O bull of Bharata race, a thousand and a
hundred *Yojanas* is the height of that prince of trees, which touches
the very heavens, O king of men. Two thousand and five hundred cubits
measure the circumference of a fruit of that tree which bursts when

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

ripe. In falling upon the earth these fruits make a loud noise, and then
pour out, O king, a silvery juice on the ground. That juice of the
*Jamvu*, becoming, O king, a river, and passing circuitously round Meru,
cometh to the (region of the) Northern Kurus. If the juice of that fruit
is quaffed, it conduces to peace of mind. No thirst is felt ever after,
O king. Decrepitude never weakens them. And there a species of gold
called *Jamvunada* and used for celestial ornaments, very brilliant and
like the complexion of *Indragopoka* insects, is produced. The men born
there are of the complexion of the morning sun.

"'On the summit of Malyavat is always seen, O bull of Bharata's race,
the fire called *Samvataka* which blazeth forth at the end of the Yuga
for the destruction of the universe. On Malyavat's summit towards the
east are many small mountains and Malyavat, O king, measures eleven
thousand <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) Yojanas. The men born there
are of the complexion of gold. And they are all fallen from the region
of Brahman and are utterers of *Brahma*. They undergo the severest of
ascetic austerities, and their vital seed is drawn up. For the
protection of creatures they all enter the sun. Numbering sixty-six
thousand, they proceed in advance of *Aruna*, surrounding the sun.
Heated with the sun's rays for sixty-six thousand years, they then enter
the lunar disc.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_49"></span>[16:3](m06007.htm#fr_49.md) Many of the Bengal
texts incorrectly read *Merorapyyantaram* for *Merorathottaram*.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[17:1](m06007.htm#fr_50.md) This *sloka* beginning
with *mani* and ending with *prabham* is omitted in the Bombay text, I
don't think rightly. If anything that seems to be a repetition is to be
omitted.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[17:2](m06007.htm#fr_51.md) *i.e.* "have fallen
away from a celestial state."

<span id="fn_52"></span>[17:3](m06007.htm#fr_52.md) In sloka 13, the Bengal
texts read *Bhayanakas* for *mahavalas*. In 15 *Mudhabhishekas* for
*Purvabhishekas*; is substituted in the Bombay text. In 1 again the
Bombay text reads *Subhas* for *drumas*.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[17:4](m06007.htm#fr_53.md) The Bengal texts have
*Chandrabhasa* for *Chandraprabha*. The difference is not material.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[18:1](m06007.htm#fr_54.md) Both the Burdwan and
the Bombay editions read *Panchashat* (five and six). The Bengal texts
generally have *panchasat* (fifty).
