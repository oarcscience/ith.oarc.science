### SECTION XII

"Sanjaya said, 'O Kauravya, that which is heard about the islands in the
north, I will recount to thee, O Great king. Listen to me now. (Thither
in the north) is the ocean whose waters are clarified butter. Then is
the ocean whose waters are curds. Next cometh the ocean whose waters are
wine, and then is another ocean of water. The islands, O king, are
double in area of one another as they proceed further and further
towards the north. And they are surrounded, O king, by these
oceans. <span id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_68.md) In the island that is in the
middle, there is a large mountain called Goura made of red arsenic; on

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

the western island, O king, is the mountain Krishna that is the
favourite (abode) of Narayana. There Kesava guardeth celestial gems (in
profusion), and thence, inclined to grace, he bestoweth happiness on
creatures. Along with the kingdoms there, O king, the (celestial) clump
of *Kusa* grass in Kusadwipa, and the *Salmali* tree in the island of
Salmalika, are adored. In the Krauncha island also, the mountain called
Maha-krauncha that is a mine of all kinds of gems is, O king, always
adored by all the four orders of men. (There), O monarch, is the
mountain called Gomanta that is huge and consists of all kinds of
metals, and whereon always resideth, mingling with those that have been
emancipated, the puissant Narayana, otherwise called Hari, graced with
prosperity and possessed of eyes like lotus leaves. In Kusadwipa, O king
of kings, there is another mountain variegated with corals and called
after the name of that island itself. This mountain is inaccessible and
made of gold. Possessed of great splendour, O Kauravya, there is a third
mountain there that is called Sumida. The sixth is called Harigiri.
These are the six principal mountains. The intervening spaces between
one another of these six mountains increaseth in the ratio of one to two
as they proceed further and further towards the north. The first
*Varsha* is called Audhido; the second is Venumandala; the third is
called Suratha; the fourth is known by the name of Kamvala; the fifth
*Varsha* is called Dhritimat; and the sixth is named Prabhakara; the
seventh *Varsha* is called Kapila. These are the seven successive
Varshas. In these, gods and *Gandharvas*, and other creatures of the
universe, sport and take delight. In these *Varshas* the inhabitants
never die. There, O king, are no robbers, nor any tribes of *Mlecchas*.
All the residents are almost white in complexion, and very delicate, O
king.

"'As regards the rest of the islands, O ruler of men, I will recount all
that hath been heard by me. Listen, O monarch, with an attentive mind.
In the Krauncha island, O great king, there is a large mountain called
Krauncha. Next to Krauncha is Vamanaka; and next to Vamanaka is
Andhakara. And next to Andhakara, <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md) O
king, is that excellent of mountains called Mainaka. After Mainaka, O
monarch, is that best of mountains called Govinda; and after Govinda, O
king, is the mountain called Nivida. O multiplier of thy race, the
intervening spaces between one another of these mountains increaseth in
the ratio of one to two. I will now tell thee the countries that lie
there. Listen to me as I speak of them. The region near Krauncha is
called Kusala; that near Vamanaka is Manonuga. The region next to
Manonuga, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, is called Ushna. After Ushna is
Pravaraka; and after Pravaraka is Andhakaraka. The country after
Andhakaraka is named Munidesa. After Munidesa the region is called
Dundubhiswana teeming with *Siddhas* and *Charanas*. The people are
almost white in complexion, O king. All these countries, O monarch, are
the habitations of gods and Gandharvas. In

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (the island of) Pushkara is a mountain called
Pushkara that abounds with jewels and gems. There always dwelleth the
divine Prajapati himself. Him all the gods and great Rishis always adore
with gratifying words and worship reverently, O king. Diverse gems from
Jamvudwipa are used there. In all these islands, O king, Brahmacharyya,
truth, and self-control of the dwellers, as also their health and
periods of life, are in the ratio of one to two as the islands are more
and more remote (northwards). O king, the land in those islands, O
Bharata, comprises but one country, for that is said to be one country
in which one religion is met with. The Supreme Prajapati himself,
upraising the rod of chastisement, always dwelleth there, protecting
those islands. He, O monarch, is the king. He is their source of bliss.
He is the father, and he is the grand-father. He it is, O best of men,
that protecteth all creatures there, mobile or immobile. Cooked food, O
Kauravya, cometh there of itself and the creatures eat it daily. O
mighty-armed one. After these regions is seen a habitation of the name
of Sama. It is of a starry-shape having four corners, and it hath, O
king, thirty-three mandalas. There dwell, O Kauravya, four princely
elephants adored by all. <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70.md) They are, O
best of the Bharatas, Vamana, and Airavata, and another, and also
Supratika. <span id="fr_71"></span>[2](#fn_71.md) O king, with rent cheeks
and mouth, I do not venture to calculate the proportions of these four
elephants. <span id="fr_72"></span>[3](#fn_72.md) Their length, breadth and
thickness have for ever remained unascertained. There in those regions,
O king, winds blow irregularly from all directions. <span
id="fr_73"></span>[4](#fn_73.md) These are seized by those elephants with
the tips of their trunks which are of the complexion of the lotus and
endued with great splendour and capable of drawing up everything in
their way. And soon enough after seizing them they then always let them
out. The winds, O king, thus let out by those respiring elephants, come
over the Earth and in consequence thereof creatures draw breath and
live.'

"Dhritarashtra said,--'Thou hast, O Sanjaya, told me everything about
the first subject very elaborately. Thou hast also indicated the
positions of the islands. 'Tell now, O Sanjaya, about what remains.'

"Sanjaya said,--'Indeed, O great king, the islands have all been
described to thee. Listen now to what I truly say about the heavenly
bodies and about Swarbhanu, O chief of the Kauravas, as regards its
dimensions. It is heard, O king, that the planet Swarbhanu is globular.
Its diameter is twelve thousand *Yojanas*, and its circumference,
because

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

it is very large, is forty-two thousand *Yojanas*, O sinless one, <span
id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74.md) as said by the learned of olden times. The
diameter of the moon, O king, is stated to be eleven thousand *Yojanas*.
Its circumference, O chief of the Kurus, is stated to be thirty-eight
thousand nine hundred *Yojanas* of the illustrious planet of cool rays.
It hath been heard that the diameter of the beneficent, fast going and
light-giving Sun, O thou of Kuru's race, is ten thousand *Yojanas*, and
his circumference, O king, is thirty-five thousand eight hundred miles,
in consequence of his largeness, O sinless one. These are the dimensions
reckoned here, O Bharata, of Arka. The planet Rahu, in consequence of
his greater bulk, envelops both the Sun and the Moon in due times. I
tell thee this in brief. With the eye of science, O great king, I have
now told thee all that thou hadst asked. Let peace be thine. I have now
told thee about the construction of the universe as indicated in the
*Shastras*. Therefore, O Kauravya, pacify thy son Duryodhana. <span
id="fr_75"></span>[2](#fn_75.md)'

"Having listened to this charming *Bhumi Parva*, O chief of the
Bharatas, a Kshatriya becometh endued with prosperity, obtaineth
fruition of all his desires, and winneth the approbation of the
righteous. <span id="fr_76"></span>[3](#fn_76.md) The king who listeneth to
this on days of the full-moon or the new-moon, carefully observing vows
all the while, hath the period of his life, his fame and energy, all
enhanced. His (deceased) sires and grandsires become gratified. Thou
hast now heard of all the merits that flow from this *Varsha* of Bharata
where we now are!'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_68"></span>[26:2](m06012.htm#fr_68.md) The second line of the
3rd sloka is read variously. The Bombay edition incorrectly reads
'*Parvataccha*' etc. etc.,; the Bengal reading is *evameva* etc. etc.
The Bengal reading is better, although the true reading, I apprehend, is
*Evametais* &c., &c.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[27:1](m06012.htm#fr_69.md) *Vamanaka* and *Vamana*
are the same words the final *ka* being a suffix causing no difference
of meaning. So *Andhakaraka* and *Andhakara* are the same.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[28:1](m06012.htm#fr_70.md) Dig-gaja, *i.e.* an
elephant supporting the globe. There are four such in Hindu mythology or
ten according to some accounts.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[28:2](m06012.htm#fr_71.md) *i.e.*, with the juice
trickling down from their cheeks and mouth. In the season of rut, a
peculiar kind of juice issues from several parts of an elephant's body.
It is believed to be the temporal-juice. The stronger and fierce the
elephant, the greater the quantity of the juice that issues out its
body.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[28:3](m06012.htm#fr_72) Tasya (singular of Tad.md)
and sa (masculine singular of Tad) both refer to the four elephants,
Gaja-chatushtaya in singular.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[28:4](m06012.htm#fr_73.md) Asamyadha lit.
"Unbound" or "unrestrained," *i.e.* freely or irregularly.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[29:1](m06012.htm#fr_74.md) It is a remarkable fact
that the ratio between the diameter and the circumference of a circle
was roughly known to the ancient Hindus. The circumference is nearly, as
stated here, three times and a half of the diameter. The next ratio, of
course, is slightly less, being three and one-seventh.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[29:2](m06012.htm#fr_75.md) The first word of this
sloka is variously read. '*Yathadishtam*' is the Bengal reading, while
the Bombay reading '*Yathoddishtam*.' If the latter reading were
adopted, the meaning would be as indicated (in the Sastras). The second
line literally rendered, is "pacify thy son Duryodhana." But how
Dhritarashtra is to pacify his son having listened to the geographical
digression, is not easy to see.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[29:3](m06012.htm#fr_76.md) For *Sadhusattamas* of
the Bengal texts, the Bombay edition reads *Sadhusammatas*. I adopt the
last.
