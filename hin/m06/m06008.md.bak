### SECTION VIII

"Dhritarashtra said,--'Tell me truly, O Sanjaya, the names of all the
*Varshas*, and of all the mountains, and also of all those that dwell on
those mountains.

"Sanjaya said,--'On the south of Sweta and the north of Nishadha, is the
*Varsha*, called Romanaka. The men that are born there are all of white
complexion, of good parentage, and handsome features. And the men born
there are also all without enemies. And they live, O king, for eleven
thousand and five hundred years, being ever of cheerful hearts. On the
south of Nishadha is the *Varsha* called Hiranmaya where is the river
called Hiranwati. There, O king, liveth that foremost of birds named
Garuda. And the people there, O monarch, are all followers of the
*Yakshas*, wealthy, and of handsome features. And, O king, the men there
are endued with great strength and have: cheerful hearts. And they live
for twelve thousand and five hundred years., O king, which is the
measure of their lives. The

mountains of Sringavat, <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md) O ruler of
men, have three beautiful summits. One of these is made of jewels and
gems, another is very wonderful, being made of all kinds of gems and
adorned with palatial mansions. There the self-luminous lady named
Sandili always liveth. On the north of Sringavat and up to the margin of
the sea, O king, the Varsha called Airavat. And because this jewelled
mountain is there, therefore is this Varsha superior to all. The sun
giveth no heat there and men are not subject to decay. And the moon
there, with the stars, becoming the only source of light, covereth (the
firmament). Possessing the radiance and complexion of the lotus, and
endued with eyes that resemble lotus-petals, the men born there have the
fragrance of the lotus. With winkless eyes, and agreeable scent
(emanating from their bodies), they go without food and have their
senses under control. They are all fallen from the region of the
celestials, and are all, O king, without sin of any kind. And they live,
O monarch, for thirteen thousand years, that being. O best of the
Bharatas, the measure of their lives. And so on the north of the milky
ocean, the Lord Hari of unlimited puissance dwelleth on his car made of
gold. That vehicle is endued with eight wheels, with numerous
supernatural creatures stationed on it, and having the speed of the
mind. And its complexion is that of fire, and it is endued with mighty
energy and adorned with *Jamvunada* gold. He is the Lord of all
creatures, and is possessed, O bull of Bharata's race, of every kind of
prosperity. In him the universe merges (when dissolution comes), and
from him it again emanates (when the creative desire seizes him). He is
the actor, and it is He that makes all others act. He, O monarch, is
earth, water, space, air, and fire. He is Sacrifice's self unto all
creatures, and fire is His mouth."

Vaisampayana continued,--"The high-souled king Dhritarashtra, thus
addressed by Sanjaya, became, O monarch, absorbed in meditation about
his sons. Endued with great energy, he then, having reflected, said
these words: 'Without doubt, O *Suta's* son, it is Time that destroyeth
the universe. And it is Time that again createth everything. Nothing
here is eternal. It is Nara and Narayana, endued with omniscience, that
destroyeth all creatures. <span id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56.md) The gods
speak of him as *Vaikuntha* (of immeasurable puissance), while men call
him *Vishnu* (one that pervadeth the Universe)!'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_55"></span>[19:1](m06008.htm#fr_55.md) The Bombay edition
reads *Tasmat-sritigamatas param*. The Bengal texts read
*Yasmat-sringamatas param*. The Bengal reading is better. The Asiatic
Society's edition contains a misprint. The meaning is, "Because Sringa
(jewelled mountain of that name), therefore superior." I have rendered
it somewhat freely.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[19:2](m06008.htm#fr_56.md) They are but portions
of the same Supreme Being.
