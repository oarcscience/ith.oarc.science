### SECTION XXIX (Bhagavad Gita Chapter V)

"Arjuna said,--'Thou applaudest, O Krishna, the abandonment of actions,
and again the application (to them). Tell me definitely which one of
these two is superior.

"The Holy One said--'Both abandonment of actions and application to
actions lead to emancipation. But of these, application to action is
superior to abandonment. He should always be known to be an ascetic who
hath no aversion nor desire. For, being free from pairs of opposites, O
thou of mighty arms, he is easily released from the bonds (of action).
Fools say, but not those that are wise, that *Sankhya* and *Yoga* are
distinct. One who stayeth in even one (of the two) reapeth the fruit of
both <span id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_180.md). Whatever seat is attained by
those who profess the *Sankhya* system, that too is reached by those who
profess the *Yoga*. He seeth truly who seeth *Sankhya* and *Yoga* as
one. <span id="fr_181"></span>[2](#fn_181.md) But renunciation, O
mighty-armed one, without devotion (to action), is difficult to attain.
The ascetic who is engaged in devotion (by action) reacheth the Supreme
Being without delay. He who is engaged in devotion (by action) and is of
pure soul, who hath conquered his body and subdued his senses, and who
indentifieth himself with all creatures, is not fettered though
performing (action). <span id="fr_182"></span>[3](#fn_182.md) The man of
devotion, who knoweth truth, thinking--*I am doing nothing*--When
seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping,
breathing, talking, excreting, taking, opening the eyelids or closing
them; he regardeth that it is the senses that are engaged in the objects
of senses. <span id="fr_183"></span>[4](#fn_183.md) He who renouncing
attachment engageth in actions, resigning them to *Brahma*, is not
touched by sin as the lotus-leaf (is not touched) by water. <span
id="fr_184"></span>[5](#fn_184.md) Those who are devotees, casting off
attachment, perform actions (attaining) purity of self, with the body,
the mind, the understanding, and even the senses (free from desire). He
who is possessed of devotion, renouncing the fruit of action, attaineth
to the highest tranquillity. He, who is not possessed of devotion and is
attached to the fruit of action, is fettered by action performed from
desire. The self-restrained embodied (self), renouncing all actions by
the mind, remains

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

at ease within the house of nine gates, neither acting himself nor
causing (anything) to act. <span id="fr_185"></span>[1](#fn_185.md) The
Lord is not the cause of the capacity for action, or of the actions of
men, or of the connection of actions and (their) fruit. It is nature
that engages (in action). The Lord receiveth no one's sin, nor also
merit. By ignorance, knowledge is shrouded. It is for this that
creatures are deluded. But of whomsoever that ignorance hath been
destroyed by knowledge of self, that knowledge (which is) like the Sun
discloseth the Supreme Being. Those whose mind is on Him, whose very
soul is He, who abide in Him, and who have Him for their goal, depart
never more to return, their sins being all destroyed by knowledge. <span
id="fr_186"></span>[2](#fn_186.md) Those, who are wise cast an equal eye on
a Brahmana endued with learning and modesty, on a cow, an elephant, a
dog, and a *chandala*. <span id="fr_187"></span>[3](#fn_187.md) Even here
has birth been conquered by them whose minds rest on equality; and since
Brahma is faultless and equable, therefore, they (are said to) abide in
Brahma. <span id="fr_188"></span>[4](#fn_188.md) He whose mind is steady,
who is not deluded, who knows Brahma, and who rests in Brahma, doth not
exult on obtaining anything that is agreeable, nor doth he grieve on
obtaining that is disagreeable. He whose mind is not attached to
external objects of sense, obtaineth that happiness which is in self;
and by concentrating his mind on the contemplation of Brahma, he
enjoyeth a happiness that is imperishable. The enjoyments born of the
contact (of the senses with their objects) are productive of sorrow. He
who is wise, O son of Kunti, never taketh pleasure in these that have a
beginning and an end. That man whoever here, before the dissolution of
the body, is able to endure the agitations resulting from desire and
wrath, is fixed on contemplation, and is happy. He who findeth happiness
within himself, (and) who sporteth within himself, he whose light (of
knowledge) is deprived from within himself, is a devotee, and becoming
one with Brahma attaineth to absorption into Brahma. Those saintly
personages whose sins have been destroyed, whose doubts have been
dispelled, who are self-restrained, and who are engaged in the good of
all creatures, obtain absorption into Brahma. For these devotees who are
freed from desire and wrath, whose minds are under control, and who have
knowledge of self, absorption into Brahma exists both here and
thereafter. <span id="fr_189"></span>[5](#fn_189.md) Excluding (from his
mind) all external objects of sense, directing the visual glance between
the brows, mingling (into one) the upward and the downward life-breaths
and making them pass through the nostrils, the devotee, who has
restrained the senses, the mind, and the understanding, being intent on
emancipation, and who is freed from desire, fear, and

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

wrath, is emancipated, indeed. Knowing me to be enjoyer of all
sacrifices and ascetic austerities, the great Lord of all the worlds,
and friend of all creatures, such a one obtaineth tranquillity.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_180"></span>[65:1](m06029.htm#fr_180.md) *Sankhya* is
renunciation of action, while *Yoga* is devotion through action.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[65:2](m06029.htm#fr_181.md) The grammatical form
of the word *Yoga* as here employed is exceptional.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[65:3](m06029.htm#fr_182.md) The first *atman* is
explained as the soul, the second as the body, by all the commentators.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[65:4](m06029.htm#fr_183.md) Taking means taking
anything with the hands.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[65:5](m06029.htm#fr_184.md) Water when thrown
over a lotus-leaf escapes without soaking or drenching the leaf at all.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[66:1](m06029.htm#fr_185.md) Telang renders *Pura*
as city, of course, the body having two eyes, two ears, two nostrils,
one mouth, and two openings for excretions, is meant.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[66:2](m06029.htm#fr_186.md) Such men are exempted
from the obligation of re-birth. Leaving this body they merge into the
Supreme Soul.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[66:3](m06029.htm#fr_187.md) The word is
*Swapacha* meaning a member of the lowest caste.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[66:4](m06029.htm#fr_188.md) "Brahma is faultless
and equable"; so Sreedhara and others,--"since faultless equality is
Brahma."

<span id="fn_189"></span>[66:5](m06029.htm#fr_189.md) The sense is that
they are at one with Brahma both here and hereafter.
