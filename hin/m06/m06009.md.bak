### SECTION IX

"Dhritarashtra said,--'Tell me truly (O Sanjaya) of this Varsha that is
called after Bharata, where this senseless force hath been collected, in

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

respect of which this my son Duryodhana hath been so very covetous,
which the sons of Pandu also are desirous of obtaining, and in which my
mind too sinketh. O, tell me this, for thou art, in my judgment endued
with intelligence.

"Sanjaya said,--'Listen to me, O king The sons of Pandu are not covetous
about this country. On the other hand, it is Duryodhana that is
covetous, and Sakuni the son of Suvala, as also many other Kshatriyas
who are rulers of the provinces, who being covetous of this country are
not able to bear one another. I will now will thee, O thou of Bharata's
race, of the tract of land known by Bharata's name. This land is the
beloved one of Indra, and, O thou of Bharata's race, this land, O
monarch, that is called after Bharata, is also the beloved land of Manu,
the son of Vivaswat, of Prithu, of Vainya, of the high-souled Ikshwaku,
of Yayati, of Amvarisha, of Mandhatri, of Nahusha, of Muchukunda, of
Sivi the son of Usinara, of Rishava, of Ila, of king Nriga, of Kusika, O
invincible one, of the high-souled Gadhi, of Somaka, O irrepressible
one, and of Dilipa, and also, O monarch, of many other mighty
Kshatriyas. I will now, O chastiser of foes, describe to thee that
country as I have heard of it. Listen to me, O king, as I speak of what
thou hast asked me. Mahendra, Malaya, Sahya, Suktimat, Rakshavat,
Vindhya, and Paripatra,--these seven are the *Kala*-mountains <span
id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57) (of Bharatvarsha.md). Besides these, O king,
there are thousands of mountains that are unknown, of hard make, huge,
and having excellent valleys. Besides these there are many other smaller
mountains inhabited by barbarous tribes. Aryans and Mlecchas, O
Kauravya, and many races, O lord, mixed of the two elements, drink the
waters of the following rivers, *viz.*, magnificent Ganga, Sindhu, and
Saraswati; of Godavari, and Narmada, and the large river called Yamuna;
of Dhrishadwati, and Vipapa, and Vipasa and Sthulavaluka; of the river
Vetravati, and that other one called Krishna-vena; of Iravati, and
Vitasta, and Payosyini, and Devika; of Vedasmrita and Vedavati, and
Tridiva, and Ikshumalavi; <span id="fr_58"></span>[2](#fn_58.md) of
Karishini, and Chitravaha, and the river called Chitrasena; of Gomati,

Rashasi and Satakumbha, and also Sarayu; of Charmanwati, and

of the river called Saravati, and Venna, and Bhimarathi; of Kaveri, and
Chuluka, and Vina, and Satavala; of Nivara, and Mahila, and Suprayoga, O

and Anushna, and Saivya, and Kapi, O Bharata; of Sadanira, and
Adhrishya, and the mighty stream Kusadhara; of Sadakanta, and Siva, and

These and many other large rivers, O king, such as Sadonirmaya and
Krishna, and Mandaga, and Mandavahini; and Mahagouri, and Durga, O
Bharata; and Chitropala. Chitraratha, and Manjula, and Vahini; and

Ananga, and Pushpaveni, and Utpalavati; and Lohitya, Karatoya, and
Vrishasabhya; and Kumari, and Rishikullya and Marisha, and Saraswati;
and Mandakini, and Supunya, Sarvasanga, O Bharata, are all mothers of
the universe and productive of great merit. Besides these, there are
rivers, by hundreds and thousands, that are not known (by names), I have
now recounted to thee, O king, all the rivers as far as I remember.

the Aundras, the Paundras, the Saisikatas, and the Parvatiyas, O sire.

"'There are other kingdoms, O bull of Bharata's race, in the south. They
are the Dravidas, the Keralas, the Prachyas, the Mushikas, and the
Vanavashikas; the Karanatakas, the Mahishakas, the Vikalpas, and also

Bharatas; the Yavanas, the Chinas, the Kamvojas, the Darunas, and many
Mleccha tribes; the Sukritvahas, the Kulatthas, the Hunas, and the
Parasikas; the Ramanas, and the Dasamalikas. These countries are,
besides, the abodes of many Kshatriya, Vaisya, and Sudra tribes. Then
again there are the Sudra-abhiras, the Dardas, the Kasmiras, and the
Pattis; the Khasiras; the Atreyas, the Bharadwajas, the Stanaposhikas,
the Poshakas, the Kalingas, and diverse tribes of Kiratas; the Tomaras,
the Hansamargas, and the Karamanjakas. These and other kingdoms are on
the east and on the north. O lord, alluding to them briefly I have told
thee all. Earth, if its resources are properly developed according to
its qualities and prowess, is like an ever-yielding <span
id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md) cow, from which the three-fold fruits of
virtue, profit and pleasure, may be milked. Brave kings conversant with
virtue and profit have become covetous of Earth. Endued with activity,
they would even cast away their lives in battle, from hunger of wealth.
Earth is certainly the refuge

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

of creatures endued with celestial bodies as also of creatures endued
with human bodies. <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md) Desirous of
enjoying Earth, the kings, O chief of the Bharatas, have become like
dogs that snatch meat from one another. Their ambition is unbounded,
knowing no gratification. <span id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64.md) It is for
this that the Kurus and the Pandavas are striving for possession of
Earth, by negotiation, disunion, gift, and battle, O Bharata. If Earth
be well looked after, it becometh the father, mother, children,
firmament and heaven, of all creatures, O bull among men.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_57"></span>[20:1](m06009.htm#fr_57.md) *i.e.* mountains
forming boundaries of divisions.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[20:2](m06009.htm#fr_58.md) The Bombay text reads
*Ikshula* and *Krimi* for "*Ikshumlavi*" occurring in Bengal texts.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[20:3](m06009.htm#fr_59.md) The Bengal texts have
*Gandakincha mahanadim*. The Bombay text reads *Vandanancha mahanadim*
with a *cha* immediately before. The Burdwan Pandits read *Chandanancha
mahanadim*.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[20:4](m06009.htm#fr_60.md) The Bombay texts read
*Tridiva* for *Nischita*; this is incorrect, for *Tridiva* occurs in the
Bombay text itself a little before. The name *Lohatarini* occurs in
various forms.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[20:5](m06009.htm#fr_61.md) For Vetravati, the
Bengal texts read Chandrabhaga. Both Chandrabhaga and Vetravati, however
occur before.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[22:1](m06009.htm#fr_62.md) Kamadhuk is that
species of kine which always yield milk.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[23:1](m06009.htm#fr_63.md) Nilakantha explains
this in this way. The gods depend on sacrifices performed by human
beings; and as regards human beings, their food is supplied by the
Earth. Superior and inferior creatures, therefore, are all supported by
the earth; the Earth then is their refuge. The word Earth in these
slokas is sometimes used to signify the world and sometimes the element
of that name.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[23:2](m06009.htm#fr_64.md) I render the last line
a little too freely. If the saying is intended to be general, the
translation should run thus: "Up to this day there is no man whose
desires can be satiated."
