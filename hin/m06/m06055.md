### SECTION LV

Sanjaya said, "When the forenoon of that day had passed away, O Bharata,
and when the destruction of cars, elephants, steeds, foot-soldiers and
horse-soldiers, proceeded on, the prince of Panchala engaged himself in
battle with these three mighty car-warriors, *viz.*, Drona's son, Salya,
and the high-souled Kripa. And the mighty heir of Panchala's king with
many sharp shafts, slew the steeds of Drona's son that were celebrated
over all the world. Deprived then of his animals, Drona's son quickly
getting up on Salya's car, showered his shafts on the hair of the
Panchala king. And beholding Dhrishtadyumna engaged in battle with
Drona's son, the son of Subhadra, O Bharata, quickly came up scattering
his sharp arrows. And, O bull of Bharata's race, he pierced Salya with
five and twenty, and Kripa with nine arrows, and Aswatthaman with eight.
Drona's son, however, quickly pierced Arjuna's son with many winged
arrows, and Salya pierced him with twelve, and Kripa with three sharp
arrows. Thy grandson Lakshmana then, beholding Subhadra's son engaged in
battle, rushed at him, excited with rage. And the battle commenced
between them. And the son of Duryodhana, excited with rage, pierced
Subhadra's son with sharp shafts in that combat. And that (feat), O
king, seemed highly wonderful. The light-handed Abhimanyu then, O bull
of Bharata's race, excited with rage, quickly pierced his cousin with
five hundred arrows. Lakshmana also, with his shafts, then cut off his
(cousin's) bow-staff at the middle, at which, O monarch, all the people
sent forth a loud shout. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, the son of
Subhadra, leaving aside that broken bow, took up another that was
beautiful and tougher. <span id="fr_366"></span>[1](#fn_366.md) And
thereupon those two bulls among men, thus engaged in combat and desirous
of counteracting each other's feats, pierced each other with sharp
shafts. King Duryodhana then, O monarch, beholding his mighty son thus
afflicted

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

by thy grandson (Abhimanyu), proceeded to that spot. And when thy son
turned (towards that spot), all the kings surrounded the son of Arjuna
on every side with crowds of cars. Incapable of being defeated in battle
and equal in prowess unto Krishna himself, that hero, O king, thus
surrounded by those heroes, was not agitated in the least. Then
Dhananjaya, beholding Subhadra's son engaged in battle, rushed to that
spot, excited with wrath, desirous of rescuing his own son. Thereupon
the kings (on the Kuru side), headed by Bhishma and Drona and with cars,
elephants and steeds, rushed impetuously at Savyasachin. Then a thick
earthly dust, suddenly raised by foot-soldiers and steeds and cars and
cavalry troopers, covering the sky appeared on the view. And those
thousands of elephants and hundreds of kings, when they came within
reach of Arjuna's arrows, were all unable to make any further advance.
And all creatures there set up loud wails, and the points of the compass
became dark. And then the transgression of the Kurus assumed a fierce
and dreadful aspect as regards its consequences. Neither the welkin, nor
the cardinal points of the compass nor the earth, nor the sun, could be
distinguished, O best of men, in consequence of the arrows shot by
Kiritin. <span id="fr_367"></span>[1](#fn_367.md) And many were the
elephants there deprived of the standards (on their backs), and many
car-warriors also, deprived of their steeds. And some leaders of car
divisions were seen wandering, having abandoned their cars. And other
car-warriors, deprived of their cars, were seen to wander hither and
thither, weapon in hand and their arms graced with *Angadas*. And riders
of steeds abandoning their steeds and of elephants abandoning their
elephants from fear of Arjuna, O king, fled away in all directions. And
kings were seen felled or falling from cars and elephants and steeds in
consequence of Arjuna's shafts. And Arjuna, assuming a fierce
countenance, cut off with his terrible shafts, the upraised arms of
warriors, mace in grasp, and arms bearing swords, O king, or darts, or
quivers, or shafts, or bows, or hooks, or standards, all over the field.
And spiked maces broken in fragments, and mallets, O sire, and bearded
darts, and short arrows, and swords also, in that battle, and
sharp-edged battle-axes, and lances, O Bharata, and shields broken into
pieces, and coats of mail also, O king, <span
id="fr_368"></span>[2](#fn_368.md) and standards, and weapons of all kinds
thrown away and umbrellas furnished with golden staves, and iron hooks
also, O Bharata, and goads and whips, and traces also, O sire, were seen
strewn over the field of battle in heaps. There was no man in thy army,
O sire, who could advance against the heroic Arjuna in battle. Whoever,
O king, advanced against Pritha's son in battle, pierced by sharp shafts
was despatched to the other world. When all these combatants of thine
broke had fled away, Arjuna and Vasudeva blew their excellent conches.
Thy sire Devavrata then, beholding the (Kuru) host routed, smilingly
addressed the heroic son of Bharadwaja in the battle and said, "This
mighty and heroic son of Pandu, *viz.*, Dhananjaya, accompanied by
Krishna, is dealing

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

with (our) troops as he alone is competent to deal with them. He is
incapable of being vanquished in battle today by any means, judging by
his form that we see now so like unto that of the Destroyer himself at
the end of the Yuga. This vast host again (of ours) is incapable of
being rallied. Behold, looking at one another, our troops are flying
away. Yon Sun, robbing in every way the vision of the whole world, is
about to reach that best of mountains called Asta. <span
id="fr_369"></span>[1](#fn_369.md) For this, O bull among men, I think that
the hour is come for the withdrawal (of the army). The warriors, who
have all been tired and struck with panic, will never fight. Having said
this unto Drona that best of preceptors, Bhishma, that mighty
car-warrior, caused thy army to be withdrawn. And then when the sun set,
the withdrawal of both thy army and theirs took place, O sire, and
twilight set in."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_366"></span>[140:1](m06055.htm#fr_366.md) The Bombay reading
'*Vegavattaram*' is better. Literally, it means, 'capable of imparting a
greater impetus.' To avoid such periphrasis I render it 'tougher'.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[141:1](m06055.htm#fr_367.md) The sense is that
all these were entirely shrouded by Arjuna's arrows.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[141:2](m06055.htm#fr_368.md) The true reading is
*Charmanam* and not *Varmanam*: also *bhumipa* and *bhutale*.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[142:1](m06055.htm#fr_369.md) *i.e.*, is about to
set.
