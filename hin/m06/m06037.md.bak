### SECTION XXXVII (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter XIII)

"The Holy One said, 'This body, O son of Kunti, is called *Kshetra*. Him
who knoweth it, the learned call *Kshetrajna*. <span
id="fr_259"></span>[2](#fn_259.md) Know me, O Bharata, to be *Kshetras*.
The knowledge of *Kshetra* and *Kshetrajna* I regard to be (true)
knowledge. What that *Kshetra* (is), and what (it is) like, and what
changes it undergoes, and whence (it comes), what is he (*viz.*,
*Kshetrajna*), and what his powers are, hear from me in brief. All this
hath in many ways been sung separately, by *Rishis* in various verses,
in well-settled texts fraught with reason and giving indications of
*Brahman*. The great elements, egoism, intellect, the unmanifest
(*viz.*, *Prakriti*), also the ten senses, the one (manas), the five
objects of sense, desire, aversion, pleasure, pain, body consciousness,
courage,--all this in brief hath been declared to be Kshetra in its
modified form. Absence of vanity, absence of ostentation, abstention
from injury, forgiveness, uprightness, devotion to preceptor, purity,
constancy, self-restraint, indifference to objects of sense, absence of
egoism, perception of the misery and evil of birth, death, decrepitude
and disease, <span id="fr_260"></span>[3](#fn_260.md)

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

freedom from attachment, absence of sympathy for son, wife, home, and
the rest, and constant equanimity of heart on attainment of good and
evil, unswerving devotion to me without meditation on anything else,
frequenting of lonely places, distaste for concourse of men, <span
id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_261.md) constancy in the knowledge of the
relation of the individual self to the supreme, perception of the object
of the knowledge of truth,--all this is called Knowledge; all that which
is contrary to this is Ignorance. <span id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_262.md)
That which is the object of knowledge I will (now) declare (to thee),
knowing which one obtaineth immortality. \[It is\] the Supreme *Brahma*
having no beginning, who is said to be neither existent nor
non-existent; whose hands and feet are on all sides, whose eyes, heads
and faces are on all sides, who dwells pervading everything in the
world, who is possessed of all the qualities of the senses (though)
devoid of the senses, without attachment (yet) sustaining all things,
without attributes (yet) enjoying (a) all attributes, <span
id="fr_263"></span>[3](#fn_263.md) without and within all creatures,
immobile and mobile, not knowable because of (his) subtlety, remote yet
near, undistributed in all beings, (yet) remaining as if distributed,
who is the sustainer of (all) beings, the absorber and the creator (of
all); who is the light of all luminous bodies, who is said to be beyond
all darkness; who is knowledge, the Object of knowledge, the End of
knowledge and seated in the hearts of all. Thus *Kshetra*, and
Knowledge, and the Object of Knowledge, have been declared (to thee) in
brief. My devotee, knowing (all) this, becomes one in spirit with me.
Know that Nature and Spirit are both without beginning (and) know (also)
that all modifications and all qualities spring from Nature. <span
id="fr_264"></span>[4](#fn_264.md) Nature is said to be the source of the
capacity of enjoying pleasures and pains. <span
id="fr_265"></span>[5](#fn_265.md) For Spirit, dwelling in nature enjoyeth
the qualities born of Nature. The cause of its births in good or evil
wombs is (its) connection with the qualities. <span
id="fr_266"></span>[6](#fn_266.md) The Supreme *Purusha* in this body is
said to be surveyor, approver, supporter, enjoyer, the

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

mighty lord, and also the Supreme Soul. <span
id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_267.md) He who thus knows Spirit, and Nature,
with the qualities, in whatever state he may be, is never born again.
Some by meditation behold the self in the self by the self; others by
devotion according to the Sankhya system; and others (again), by
devotion through works. Others yet not knowing this, worship, hearing of
it from others. Even these, devoted to what is heard, cross over
death. <span id="fr_268"></span>[2](#fn_268.md) Whatever entity, immobile
or mobile, cometh into existence, know that, O bull of Bharata's race,
to be from the connection of *Kshetra* and *Kshetrajna* (matter and
spirit). He seeth the Supreme Lord dwelling alike in all beings, the
Imperishable in the Perishable. For seeing the Lord dwelling alike
everywhere, one doth not destroy <span id="fr_269"></span>[3](#fn_269.md)
himself by himself, and then reacheth the highest goal. He seeth (truly)
who seeth all actions to be wrought by nature alone in every way and the
self likewise to be not the doer. When one seeth the diversity of
entities as existing in one, and the issue (everything) from that (One),
then is one said to attain to Brahma. This inexhaustible Supreme Self, O
son of Kunti, being without beginning and without attributes, doth not
act, nor is stained even when stationed in the body. As space, which is
ubiquitous, is never, in consequence of its subtlety tainted, so the
soul, stationed in every body, is never tainted. <span
id="fr_270"></span>[4](#fn_270.md) As the single Sun lights up the entire
world, so the Spirit, O Bharata, lights up the entire (sphere of)
matters. They that, by the eye of knowledge, know the distinction
between matter and spirit, and the deliverance from the nature of all
entities, attain to the Supreme. <span id="fr_271"></span>[5](#fn_271.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_259"></span>[84:2](m06037.htm#fr_259.md) The learned, *i.e.*,
they that are themselves acquainted with is *Kshetra* and what not. As
explained by Krishna himself below, *Kshetra* is Matter, and
*Kshetrajna* is Soul.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[84:3](m06037.htm#fr_260.md) *Dukha-dosha* is
explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara as a *Dwanda* compound.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[85:1](m06037.htm#fr_261.md) *Vivikta* is
explained by the commentators as *Suddha* or *Chittaprasadakara*. There
can be no doubt, however, that it is in opposition to *Janasamsadi*
following. Hence I render it "lonely".

<span id="fn_262"></span>[85:2](m06037.htm#fr_262.md) The object of the
knowledge of truth is the dispelling of ignorance and the acquisition of
happiness.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[85:3](m06037.htm#fr_263.md) Nor having eyes,
*etc*., yet seeing, *etc*.; without attributes, yet having or enjoying
all that the attributes give.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[85:4](m06037.htm#fr_264.md) All modifications,
*i.e.*, of material forms; all qualities, *i.e.*, pleasure, pain, *etc*.
The word rendered "nature" is *Prakriti* (primal matter), and that
rendered "spirit" is *Purusha* (the active principle). *Vikarna* and
*Gunan* include all material forms and attributes of the soul.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[85:5](m06037.htm#fr_265.md)
*Karya-karana-karttritwa* is explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara to
mean "the capacity of working (residing) in the body and the senses." K.
T. Telang adopts this. Mr. Davies in his text has "in the activity of
the organs of action." In course of his philological notes, however, he
gives the correct rendering. 'Is said to be' is explained by Sreedhara.
as referring to Kapila and others.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[85:6](m06037.htm#fr_266.md) It is the embodied
spirit only that can enjoy the qualities of Nature. Then again, the kind
of connection it has with those qualities settles its birth in good or
evil wombs.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[86:1](m06037.htm#fr_267.md) Mr. Davies
misunderstands the grammatical connection of the words in the second
line of this verse. K. T. Telang, following Sreedhara, says, the word
should be rendered "approver."

<span id="fn_268"></span>[86:2](m06037.htm#fr_268.md) What is heard,
*i.e.*, the *Srutis* or the sacred doctrines.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[86:3](m06037.htm#fr_269.md) Destroying self by
self is to be deprived of true knowledge.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[86:4](m06037.htm#fr_270.md) *Sarvatra* in the
second line is explained by Sreedhara as "in every body, superior and
inferior." Grammatically it may mean also, "in every part of the body."
Such a theory, however, of the seat of the soul would be contrary to all
Hindu ideas.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[86:5](m06037.htm#fr_271.md)
*Bhuta-Prakriti-moksha* is explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara as
*moksha* or deliverance from the *prakriti* (nature) of *bhutas'* or
*entities*. It is true knowledge that effects such deliverance. Mr.
Davies renders it "deliverance of beings from Nature." This is evidently
incorrect. "Beings" is not synonymous with self or soul.
