### SECTION XXXIX (Bhagavad Gita Chapter XV)

"The Holy One said, 'They say that the *Aswattha*, having its roots
above and branches below, is eternal, its leaves are the *Chhandas*. He
who knoweth it, knoweth the *Vedas*. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[4](#fn_278.md) Downwards and upwards are stretched its
branches which are enlarged by the qualities; its sprouts are the
objects of senses. Downwards its roots, leading to action, are extended
to this world of men. <span id="fr_279"></span>[5](#fn_279.md) Its form
cannot here (below) be thus known, nor

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (its) end, nor (its) beginning, nor (its)
support. Cutting, with the hard weapon of unconcern, this *Aswattha* of
roots firmly fixed, then should one seek for that place repairing
whither one returneth not again (thinking)--I will seek the protection
of that Primeval Sire from whom the ancient course of (worldly) life
hath flowed.--Those that are free from pride and delusion, that have
subdued the evil of attachment, that are steady in the contemplation of
the relation of the Supreme to the individual self, from whom desire
hath departed, freed from the pairs of opposites known by the names of
pleasure and pain (and the like), repair, undeluded, to that eternal
seat. The sun lighteth not that \[seat\], nor the moon, nor fire.
Whither going none returneth, that is my supreme seat. An eternal
portion of Me is that which, becoming an individual soul in the world of
life, draweth to itself the (five) senses with the mind as the sixth
which all depend on nature. When the sovereign (of this bodily frame)
assumeth or quitteth (a) body, it departeth taking away these, like the
wind (taking away) perfumes from their seats. Presiding over the ear,
the eye, (the organs of) touch, taste, and smell, and also over the
mind, he enjoyeth all objects of senses. They that are deluded do not
see (him) when quitting or abiding in (the body), when enjoying or
joined to the qualities. They (however) see that have the eye of
knowledge. <span id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_280.md) Devotees exerting
(towards that end) behold him dwelling in themselves. They (however)
that are senseless and whose minds are not restrained, behold him not,
even while exerting (themselves). <span id="fr_281"></span>[2](#fn_281.md)
That splendour dwelling in the sun which illumines the vast universe,
that (which is) in the moon, and that (which is) in the fire, know that
splendour to be mine. Entering into the earth I uphold creatures by my
force; and becoming the juicy moon I nourish all herbs. <span
id="fr_282"></span>[3](#fn_282.md) Myself becoming the vital heat
(*Vaiswanara*) residing in the bodies of creatures that breathe, (and)
uniting with the upward and the downward life-breaths, I digest the four
kinds of food. <span id="fr_283"></span>[4](#fn_283.md) I am seated in the
hearts of all. From Me are memory and knowledge and the loss of both. I
am the objects of knowledge to be known by (the aid of) all the *Vedas*.
I am the author of the *Vedantas*, and I alone

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

am the knower of the *Vedas*. <span id="fr_284"></span>[1](#fn_284.md)
There are these two entities in the world, *viz.*, the mutable and the
immutable. The mutable is all (these) creatures. The unchangeable one is
called the immutable. <span id="fr_285"></span>[2](#fn_285.md) But there is
another, the Supreme Being, called *Paramatman*, who was the Eternal
Lord, pervading the three worlds, sustaineth (them) (and) since I
transcend the mutable, and am higher than even the immutable; for this I
am celebrated in the world (among men) and in the *Veda* as
*Purushottama* (the Highest Being). He who, without being deluded,
knoweth Me as this Highest Being,--he knowing all, O Bharata,
worshippeth Me in every way. <span id="fr_286"></span>[3](#fn_286.md) Thus,
O sinless one, hath this knowledge, forming the greatest of mysteries,
been declared by Me (to thee). Knowing this, O Bharata, one will become
gifted with intelligence, and will have done all he needs do.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_278"></span>[88:4](m06039.htm#fr_278.md) The '*Aswattha*' is
the sacred Indian fig tree, here emblematical of the course of worldly
life. Its roots are above; those roots are the Supreme Being. Its
branches are below, these being the inferior deities. Its leaves are the
sacred hymns of the Vedas, *i.e.*, as leaves keep the tree alive and
even conduce to its fruits, so the Vedas support this tree and lead to
salvation.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[88:5](m06039.htm#fr_279.md) Upwards and downwards
*i.e.*, from the highest to the lowest of created things. Enlarged by
the qualities, *i.e.*, the qualities appearing as the body, the senses,
etc. The sprouts are the objects of sense, being attached to the senses
themselves as sprouts to branches. The roots extending downwards are the
desires for diverse enjoyments. Thus Telang, following the commentators.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[89:1](m06039.htm#fr_280.md) Joined to the
qualities, *i.e.*, perceiving objects of sense or experiencing pleasure
and pain.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[89:2](m06039.htm#fr_281.md) "*Atmani*" in the
first line is "in the body" as explained by Sreedhara and others: "in
the understanding" as explained by Sankara. It seems, however, to be
used in the general senses of "themselves", without particular reference
to either body or understanding. An *Akritatman* is one whose soul is
not made or formed; generally, "a person of unsubdued passions."

<span id="fn_282"></span>[89:3](m06039.htm#fr_282.md) There can be no
question that *Soma* here means the moon and not the *Soma* juice
quaffed in sacrifices, or sap. It is the moon that supports, nourishes
all herbs and numerous passages may be quoted from Hindu sacred
literature to show this. Mr. Davies, therefore, clearly errs in
rendering *Soma* as "the savoury juice."

<span id="fn_283"></span>[89:4](m06039.htm#fr_283.md) The four kinds of
food are: that which is masticated, that which is sucked, that which is
licked, and that which is drunk.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[90:1](m06039.htm#fr_284.md) *Apohanam* is loss or
removal. It is a well-known word and its application here is very
natural. I am memory and knowledge (to those that use them for virtuous
acts). I am the loss of these faculties (to those that engage in
unrighteous acts). Mr. Davies erroneously renders it as "The power of
reason."

<span id="fn_285"></span>[90:2](m06039.htm#fr_285.md) *Kutashtha* is
rendered by K. T. Telang as "the unconcerned one", by Mr. Davies as "the
lord on high." I incline to the scholiasts who explain it as "the
uniform or the unchangeable one."

<span id="fn_286"></span>[90:3](m06039.htm#fr_286.md) *Sarvabhavena* is
explained by Sankara by *Sarvatma-chintaya* (thinking Me to be the soul
of everything). Sreedhara explains it as *Sarvaprakarena*. Why may it
not mean "with the whole soul" or "with excess of love."
