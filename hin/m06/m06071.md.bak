### SECTION LXXI

Sanjaya said, "Beholding his brothers and the other kings engaged in
battle with Bhishma, Dhananjaya, with weapons upraised, rushed against
the son of Ganga. Hearing the blare of *Panchajanya* and the twang of
the bow *Gandiva*, and seeing also the standard of Pritha's son, a great
fear entered our hearts. And the standard that we behold, O king, of the
wielder of *Gandiva* bore the device of lion's tail and looked like a
blazing mountain in the welkin. Beautiful and of celestial workmanship,
it was variegated with diverse hues, and looking like a risen comet it
could not be obstructed

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

by trees. And in that great battle, the warriors beheld *Gandiva*, the
back of whose staff was decked with pure gold, and which looked
beautiful like a flash of lightning in the midst of a mass of clouds in
the firmament. And while slaying the combatants of thy army, the shouts
we heard uttered by Arjuna seemed to resemble the loud roars of Indra
himself, and the slaps also of his palms were frightfully loud. Like a
roaring mass of clouds charged with lightning and aided by a raging
tempest, Arjuna incessantly poured his arrowy showers on all sides,
completely shrouding the ten points of the compass. Dhananjaya then
possessed of terrible weapons, quickly proceeded towards the son of
Ganga. Deprived of four senses in consequence of his weapons, we could
not then distinguish the East from the West. And thy warriors, then, O
bull of Bharata's race,--their animals tired, steeds slain, and hearts
depressed,--thoroughly confounded <span id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_395.md)
and huddling close to one another, sought Bhishma's protection along
with all thy sons. And in that battle Bhishma the son of Santanu became
their protector. Struck with fear, car-warriors jumping down from their
cars, cavalry soldiers jumping down from the backs of their steeds, and
the foot-soldiers where they stood, all began to fall down on the earth.
Hearing the twang of *Gandiva* that resembled the roar of the thunder,
all thy warriors were struck with fear and seemed, O Bharata, to melt
away. Then, O king, with many huge and fleet steeds of the Kamvoja
breed, and surrounded by many thousand of Gopas with a large Gopayana
force and supported by the Madras, the Sauviras, the Gandharas and the
Trigartas, and surrounded by all the principal Kalingas, the king of the
Kalingas, and king Jayadratha accompanied by all the kings and supported
by a large force of diverse races with Dussasana at their head, and
fourteen thousand principal horsemen, urged by thy son, surrounded the
son of Suvala (for supporting him). Then in that battle, all the
Pandavas, united together, and riding on separate cars and animals,
began, O bull of Bharata's race, to slaughter thy troops. <span
id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_396.md) And the dust raised by car-warriors and
steeds and foot-soldiers, looking like a mass of clouds, made the field
of battle exceedingly awful. And with a large force consisting of
elephants, steeds and cars, and armed with lances and bearded darts and
broad-headed shafts, Bhishma engaged in battle with the diadem decked
(Arjuna). And the king of Avanti engaged with the ruler of Kasi, and the
ruler of the Sindhus engaged with Bhimasena. And king Yudhishthira with
his sons and counsellors engaged with Salya, the famous chief of the
Madras. And Vikarna engaged with Sahadeva, and Chitrasena with
Sikhandin. And the Matsyas, O king, engaged with Duryodhana, and Sakuni;
and Drupada and Chekitana, and that mighty car-warrior Satyaki engaged
in battle with the high-souled Drona aided by his son. And Kripa and
Kritavarman both rushed against Dhrishtadyumna. And thus, all over the
field, rushing bodies of horses, of elephants and cars, engaged with one
another in battle. And although there

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

were no clouds in the sky, yet flashes of lightning were seen. And all
the points of the compass were covered with dust. And, O king, fierce
meteors were seen failing with thundering noise. And violent winds blew
and a shower of dust fell from above. And the sun, covered by the dust
raised by the troops, disappeared in the firmament. And all the
warriors, covered by that dust and battling with weapons, were deprived
of their senses. And the sound made by weapons, all capable of
penetrating through every armour and hurled from heroic arms, became a
tremendous uproar. And, O bull of Bharata's race, weapons hurled from
excellent arms and possessed of stellar brightness, illumined the whole
welkin. And variegated shields made of bull's hides and embossed with
gold were strewn, O bull of Bharata's race, all over the field. And
heads and limbs were seen falling on all sides, cut off with swords and
scimitars possessed of solar effulgence. And great car-warriors, the
wheels, axles, and boxes of whose cars were broken, fell down on the
ground, their steeds slain and their tall standards tumbling down. <span
id="fr_397"></span>[1](#fn_397.md) And many car-warriors having been slain,
their steeds, mangled with weapons, fell down as they ran dragging the
cars (to which they were yoked). And, in many places over the field,
excellent steeds, afflicted with arrows, with limbs mangled, and with
their traces on, ran, dragging the car-yokes after them. And many
car-warriors, with their charioteers and steeds, were seen, O king, to
be crushed by single elephants endued with great strength. <span
id="fr_398"></span>[2](#fn_398.md) And in that battle, in the midst of
large forces, many elephants, scenting the odour of the temporal juice
of their compeers, began to snuff the breeze repeatedly. And the whole
field was strewn with slain elephants, deprived of life by means of
broad-headed shafts and falling down with the wooden edifices and the
guides on their backs. And many elephants, in, the midst of large forces
crushed, with the standards and warriors on their backs, by huge
compeers urged by their guides, fell down on the field. And many
car-shafts, O king, were seen to be broken in that battle by huge
elephants using their trunks, each of which resembled the trunk of the
prince of elephants (called Airavata). And many car-warriors also, in
that conflict, the *Jalas* of whose cars had been broken, were like
branches of trees dragged down by tuskers, seized by the hair of their
heads and, thrashed violently on the ground, were crushed into shapeless
masses. And other huge elephants, dragging cars that were entangled with
other cars, ran in all directions shrieking loudly. And those elephants,
thus dragging those cars, looked like others of their species dragging
lotus-stalks growing in lakes. And thus was that vast field of battle
strewn over with cavalry soldiers and foot-soldiers and great
car-warriors and standards."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_395"></span>[180:1](m06071.htm#fr_395.md) *Kandigbhutas* lit.
"not knowing which point of the compass was which."

<span id="fn_396"></span>[180:2](m06071.htm#fr_396.md) In the second line
of 17, the Bombay text incorrectly reads *Arjunam* for *Pandavas*.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[181:1](m06071.htm#fr_397.md) In the first line of
32 the Bengal reading is *Mahabhujas*. The correct reading seems to be
(as in the Bombay text) *Mahadhvajas*.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[181:2](m06071.htm#fr_398.md) The last half of the
second line of 35 in the Bengal text is vicious, I adopt the Bombay
reading.
