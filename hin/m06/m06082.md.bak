### SECTION LXXXII

Sanjaya said, "O chief of the Bharatas, Ganga's son, once more
addressing thy son who was plunged in thought, told him these delightful

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

words, 'Myself and Drona and Salya and Kritavarman of Satwata's race,
and Aswatthaman and Vikarna and Bhagadatta and Suvala's son and Vinda
and Anuvinda of Avanti, and Valhika with the Valhikas, <span
id="fr_409"></span>[1](#fn_409.md) and the mighty king of the Trigartas and
the invincible ruler of the Magadhas, Vrihadvala the king of the
Kosalas, and Chitrasena and Vivingsati and many thousands of
car-warriors graced with tall standards, a large number of country-born
steeds well-mounted with excellent horse-soldiers and many infuriate
elephants of large size with temporal juice issuing from their mouths
and cheeks, and many brave foot-soldiers armed with diverse weapons and
born in diverse realms, are all prepared to do battle for thy
sake. <span id="fr_410"></span>[2](#fn_410.md) These, and many others ready
for thy sake to lay down their lives, are, as I think, competent to
vanquish the very gods in battle. I should, however, always tell thee, O
king, what is for thy good. The Pandavas are incapable of being
vanquished by the very gods with Vasava. They have Vasudeva for their
ally and are equal to Mahendra himself in prowess. As regards myself, I
shall, however, always do thy bidding. Either I shall vanquish the
Pandavas in battle or they will vanquish me. Having said these words,
the grandsire gave him an excellent herb of great efficacy for healing
his wounds. And therewith thy son was cured of his wounds. Then at dawn
when the sky was clear, the valiant Bhishma, that foremost of men
well-versed in all kinds of array, himself disposed his troops in that
array called *Mandala* bristling with weapons. And it abounded with
foremost of warriors and with tuskers and foot-soldiers. And it was
surrounded on all sides with many thousands of cars, and with large
bodies of horsemen armed with swords and lances. Near unto every
elephant were placed seven cars, and near unto every car were placed
seven horsemen. And behind every horseman were placed seven bowmen, and
behind every bowman were seven combatants with shields. And thus, O
king, thy army, arrayed by mighty car-warriors, stood for fierce battle,
protected by Bhishma. And ten thousand horses, and as many elephants,
and ten thousand cars, and thy sons, all equipped in mail, *viz.*, the
heroic Chitrasena and others, protected the grandsire. And it was seen
that Bhishma was protected by those brave warriors, and those princes
themselves of great strength, accoutred in mail, were (in their turn)
protected by him. And Duryodhana accoutred in mail sat upon his car on
the field, and possessed of every grace, looked resplendent like Sakra
himself in heaven. Then, O Bharata, loud were the shouts uttered by thy
sons and deafening the clatter of cars and the uproar of musical
instruments. That mighty and impenetrable array of those slayer of foes,
*viz.*, the Dhartarashtras (in the form called) *Mandala*, (thus)
arrayed by Bhishma, began to proceed, facing the west. Incapable of
being defeated by enemies, it looked beautiful in every point. Beholding

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

then the array called *Mandala* that was exceedingly fierce, king
Yudhishthira himself disposed his troops in the array called *Vajra*.
And when the divisions were thus arrayed, car-warriors and horsemen,
stationed in their proper places, uttered leonine shouts. Accompanied by
their respective forces, the brave warriors of both armies, well versed
in smiting, and longing for battle, proceeded, desirous of breaking each
other's array. And Bharadwaja's son proceeded against the king of the
Matsyas, and his son (Aswatthaman) against Sikhandin. And king
Duryodhana himself rushed against the son of Prishata. And Nakula and
Sahadeva went forth against the king of the Madras. And Vinda and
Anuvinda of Avanti proceeded against Iravat. And many kings together
battled with Dhananjaya. And Bhimasena, exerting himself well, opposed
the son of Hridika in battle. And possessed of great prowess,
(Abhimanyu) the son of Arjuna, fought in battle, O king, against the
sons Chitrasena and Vikarna, and Durmarshana. And Hidimva's son, that
prince of the *Rakshasas*, rushed against that mighty bowman, the ruler
of the Pragjyotishas, like one infuriate elephant against another. And
the *Rakshasa* Alamvusha, O king, excited with wrath, rushed in battle
against the invincible Satyaki in the midst of his followers. And
Bhurisravas, exerting himself greatly, fought against Dhrishtaketu. And
Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, proceeded against king Srutayush. And
Chekitana in that battle fought against Kripa. And others (among the
Kuru warriors), exerting themselves powerfully, proceeded against that
mighty car-warrior Bhima. And thousands of (other) kings surrounded
Dhananjaya, with darts, lances, arrows, maces, and spiked clubs in their
hands. Then Arjuna, excited with great wrath, addressing him of
Vrishni's race, said, 'Behold, O Madhava, the Dhartarashtra troops in
battle, arrayed by the high-souled son of Ganga, acquainted with every
kind of array. Behold, O Madhava, those brave warriors, countless in
number, and desirous of battle (with me). Behold, O Kesava, the ruler of
the Trigartas with his brothers. <span id="fr_411"></span>[1](#fn_411.md)
This very day I shall slay them all, O Janardana, before thy
eyes,--them, that is, O foremost of the Yadus, who, longing for battle
(with me), are on the field.' Having said these words, the son of Kunti,
rubbing his bowstring, showered his arrows on that multitude of kings.
And those great bowmen also, poured on him thick showers of arrows, like
clouds that fill a lake with torrents of rain in the rainy season. And
loud shouts were heard in thy army, O monarch, when in that great battle
the two Krishnas were seen covered with thick showers of arrows. And the
gods, the celestial *Rishis*, and the *Gandharvas* with the *Uragas*,
beholding the two Krishnas in that state, were filled with great wonder.
Then Arjuna, O king, excited with wrath, invoked the *Aindra* weapon.
And then the prowess we beheld of Vijaya seemed to be highly wonderful
insomuch that those showers of weapons shot by his foes were

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

checked by his myriads of arrows. And there among those thousands of
kings and steeds and elephants, was none, O king, that was not wounded.
And others, O sire, the son of Pritha pierced, each with two or three
arrows. And while being thus struck by Pritha, they sought the
protection of Bhishma, the son of Santanu. But Bhishma then became the
rescuer of those warriors who were like men sinking in the fathomless
deep. And in consequence of those warriors thus flying away and mixing
with thy troops, thy broken ranks, O king, were agitated like the vast
deep with a tempest."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_408"></span>[200:1](m06081.htm#fr_408.md) The last verse is
read variously. But the Bombay and the Bengal texts have faults of their
own. The first word is *ugranadam* (Bengal) and not *ugranagam*
(Bombay). The *Vahuvarnarupam* (Bombay) is correct, and not
*Vahuvarnarutam* (Bengal). The last word of the first line is
*Samudirnamevam* (Bombay), and not *Samudirnavarnam* (Bengal).

<span id="fn_409"></span>[201:1](m06082.htm#fr_409.md) Differently read in
the Bengal texts, *viz.*, *Somadatta* with the *Saindhavas*.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[201:2](m06082.htm#fr_410.md) The Bengal reading
*Rathas* in the first line of 6 is a mistake; should be, as in the
Bombay text, *tatha*.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[202:1](m06082.htm#fr_411.md) The last word of the
first line of 36 is *amitan* in the Bengal texts. The Bombay reading is
*Varmitan*. I prefer the Bengal reading.
