### SECTION XXVII (Bhagavad Gita Chapter III)

"Arjuna said,--'If devotion, O Janardana, is regarded by thee as
superior to work, why then, O Kesava, dost thou engage me in such
dreadful work? By equivocal words thou seemest to confound my
understanding. Therefore, tell (me) one thing definitely by which I may
attain to what is good.'

"The Holy One said,--'It hath already been said by me, O sinless one,
that here are, in this world, two kinds of devotion; that of the
*Sankhyas* through knowledge and that of the *yogins* through work. A
man doth not acquire freedom from work from (only) the non-performance
of work. Nor doth he acquire final emancipation from only renunciation
(of work). No one can abide even for a moment without doing work. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_150.md) That man of deluded soul who, curbing
the organs of sense, liveth mentally cherishing the objects of sense, is
said to be a dissembler. He however, O Arjuna, who restraining (his)
senses by his mind, engageth in devotion (in the form) of work with the
organs of work, and is free from attachment, is distinguished (above
all). (Therefore), do thou always apply yourself to work, for action is
better than inaction. Even the support of thy body cannot be
accomplished without work. <span id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_151.md) This
world is fettered by all work other than that which is (performed) for
Sacrifice. (Therefore), O son of Kunti, perform work for the sake of
*that*, freed from attachment. <span id="fr_152"></span>[3](#fn_152.md) In
olden times, the Lord of Creation, creating men and sacrifice together,
said,--flourish by means of this (Sacrifice). Let this (Sacrifice) be to
you (all) the dispenser of all objects cherished by you. Rear the gods
with this, and let the gods (in return) rear you. Thus fulfilling the
mutual interest you will obtain that which is beneficial (to you). <span
id="fr_153"></span>[4](#fn_153.md) Propitiated with sacrifices the gods
will bestow on you the pleasures you desire. He who enjoyeth (himself)
without giving them what

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

they have given, is assuredly a thief. The good who eat the remnant of
sacrifices are freed from all sins. Those unrighteous ones incur sin who
dress food for their own sake.--From food are all creatures; and
sacrifice is the outcome of work. <span id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_154.md)
Know that work proceeds from the *Vedas*; *Vedas* have proceeded from
Him who hath no decay. Therefore, the all-pervading Supreme Being is
installed in sacrifice. <span id="fr_155"></span>[2](#fn_155.md) He who
conformeth not to this wheel that is thus revolving, that man of sinful
life delighting (the indulgence of) his senses, liveth in vain, O
Partha. <span id="fr_156"></span>[3](#fn_156.md) The man, however, that is
attached to self only, that is contented with self, and that is pleased
in his self,--hath no work (to do). He hath no concern whatever with
action nor with any omission here. Nor, amongst all creatures, is there
any upon whom his interest dependeth. <span
id="fr_157"></span>[4](#fn_157.md) Therefore, always do work that should be
done, without attachment. The man who performeth work without
attachment, attaineth to the Supreme. By work alone, Janaka and others,
attained the accomplishment of their objects. Having regard also to the
observance by men of their duties, it behoveth thee to work. Whatever a
great man doth, is also done by vulgar people. Ordinary men follow the
ideal set by them (the great). <span id="fr_158"></span>[5](#fn_158.md)
There is nothing whatever for me, O Partha, to do in the three worlds,
(since I have) nothing for me which hath not been acquired; still I
engage in action. <span id="fr_159"></span>[6](#fn_159.md) Because if at
any time I do not, without sloth, engage in action, men would follow my
path, O Partha, on all sides. The worlds would perish if I did not
perform work, and I should cause intermixture of castes and ruin these
people. As the ignorant work, O Bharata, having attachment to the
performer, so should a wise man work without being attached, desiring to
make men observant of their duties. A wise man should not cause
confusion of understanding amongst ignorant persons, who have attachment
to work itself; (on the other hand) he should (himself) acting with
devotion engage them to all (kinds of) work. All works are, in every
way, done by the qualities of nature. He, whose mind is deluded

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

by egoism, however, regards himself as the actor. <span
id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_160.md) But he, O mighty-armed one, who knoweth
the distinction (of self) from qualities and work, is not attached to
work, considering that it is his senses alone (and not his self) that
engage in their objects. <span id="fr_161"></span>[2](#fn_161.md) Those who
are deluded by the qualities of nature, become attached to the works
done by the qualities. A person of perfect knowledge should not bewilder
those men of imperfect knowledge. <span id="fr_162"></span>[3](#fn_162.md)
Devoting all work to me, with (thy) mind directed to self, engage in
battle, without desire, without affection and with thy (heart's)
weakness dispelled. <span id="fr_163"></span>[4](#fn_163.md) Those men who
always follow this opinion of mine with faith and without cavil attain
to final emancipation even by work. But they who cavil at and do not
follow this opinion of mine, know, that, bereft of all knowledge and
without discrimination, they are ruined. Even a wise man acts according
to his own nature. All living beings follow (their own) nature. What
then would restraint avail? The senses have, as regards the objects of
the senses, either affection or aversion fixed. One should not submit to
these, for they are obstacles in one's way. <span
id="fr_164"></span>[5](#fn_164.md) One's own duty, even if imperfectly
performed, is better than being done by other even if well performed.
Death in (performance of) one's own duty is preferable. (The adoption
of) the duty of another carries fear (with it).

"Arjuna said, 'Impelled by whom, O son of the Vrishni race, doth a man
commit sin, even though unwilling and as if constrained by force'?

"The Holy One said,--'It is desire, it is wrath, born of the attribute
of passion; it is all devouring, it is very sinful. Know this to be the
foe in this world. <span id="fr_165"></span>[6](#fn_165.md) As fire is
enveloped by smoke, a mirror by dust, the foetus by the womb, so is
*this* enveloped by desire. Knowledge, O son of Kunti, is enveloped by
this constant foe of the wise in the form of desire which is insatiable
and like a fire. The senses, the mind and the understanding are said to
be its abode. With these it deludeth the embodied self, enveloping (his)
knowledge. Therefore, restraining (thy) senses first, O bull of
Bharata's race, cast off this wicked thing, for it destroyeth knowledge
derived from instruction and meditation. <span
id="fr_166"></span>[7](#fn_166.md) It hath been said that the senses are
superior (to the body which is inert). Superior to the senses is the
mind. Superior to the

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

mind is the knowledge. But which is superior to knowledge is He. <span
id="fr_167"></span>[1](#fn_167.md) Thus knowing that which is superior to
knowledge and restraining (thy) self by self, slay, O mighty-armed one,
the enemy in the shape of desire which is difficult to conquer.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_150"></span>[59:1](m06027.htm#fr_150.md) *Prakritijais Gunas*
is explained by Sreedhara as qualities born of one's nature such as
*Ragadveshadi*. Sankara thinks that they are the qualities or attributes
of primal matter (which enters into the composition of every self) such
as *Satwa*, *Rajas*, and *Tamas*.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[59:2](m06027.htm#fr_151.md) "Apply to work",
*i.e.* to work as prescribed in the scriptures. Thus says Sankara. "To
morning and evening prayers, etc." says Sreedhara.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[59:3](m06027.htm#fr_152.md) Sacrifices Vishnu's
self as declared by the Srutis; work for sacrifice, therefore, is work
for Vishnu's sake or gratification. For the sake of that *i.e.*, for
sacrifice's, or "Vishnu's sake. So say all the commentators.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[59:4](m06027.htm#fr_153.md) *Bhavaya* is
explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara as *Vradhaya* or make grow.
Perhaps, "rear" is the nearest approach to it in English. K. T. Telang
renders it, 'please.' The idea is eminently Indian. The gods are fed by
sacrifices, and in return they feed men by sending rain. The Asuras
again who warred with the gods warred with sacrifices.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[60:1](m06027.htm#fr_154.md) *Parjjanya* is
explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara as rain. It means also the
clouds or the origin of rain.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[60:2](m06027.htm#fr_155.md) The word in the
original that is rendered in the Vedas is Brahma. It may mean the
Supreme Soul. Of course, in Brahmanic literature, the Vedas are Brahma
and Brahma is the Vedas, but still in the second line of 15 there is no
necessity of taking Brahma as equivalent to the Vedas, I do not think
Telang is accurate in his rendering of this line.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[60:3](m06027.htm#fr_156.md) The wheel referred to
is what has been said before, *viz.*, from the Vedas are work, from work
is rain, from rain is food, from food are creatures, from creatures
again work and so back to the Vedas.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[60:4](m06027.htm#fr_157.md) The sense seems to
be, as explained by the commentators, that such a man earns no merit by
action, nor sin by inaction or omission. Nor is there anybody from the
Supreme Being to the lowest creature on whom he depends for anything.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[60:5](m06027.htm#fr_158.md) The example set by
the great is always catching, *Itaras*, here, is Vulgar and not "other".
*Kurute* which I have rendered as "maketh" is used in the sense of
"regardeth." *Pramanam*, however, may not necessarily mean something
else that is set up as an ideal. It may refer to the actions themselves
of the great men set up by them as a standard.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[60:6](m06027.htm#fr_159.md) Sreedhara would
connect "in the three worlds" with what follows. I follow Sankara and
the natural order of words.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[61:1](m06027.htm#fr_160.md) The word rendered
"nature" is *prakriti*. It really implies "primal matter."

<span id="fn_161"></span>[61:2](m06027.htm#fr_161.md) The second line,
literally rendered, is "deeming that qualities engage in qualities." The
first "qualities" imply the senses, and the second, the objects of the
senses. The purport is that one knowing the distinction referred to,
never thinks that his soul is the actor, for that which is work is only
the result of the senses being applied to their objects.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[61:3](m06027.htm#fr_162.md) *Guna-karmashu* is
explained by Sankara as works of the qualities, or works done by them.
Sreedhara explains the compound as "qualities and (their) works."

<span id="fn_163"></span>[61:4](m06027.htm#fr_163.md) Devoting all work to
me, *i.e.*, in the belief that all you do is for me or my sake.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[61:5](m06027.htm#fr_164.md) The senses, as
regards their diverse objects in the world, are either drawn towards
them or repelled by them. These likes and dislikes (in the case of men
who, of course, only act according to their nature) stand in the way of
their emancipation, if men submit to them.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[61:6](m06027.htm#fr_165.md) Desire, if not
gratified, results in wrath. Thus say the commentators.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[61:7](m06027.htm#fr_166.md) *Prajahi* is
explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara as *parityaja* (cast off).

<span id="fn_167"></span>[62:1](m06027.htm#fr_167.md) He is the Supreme
Soul or Being.
