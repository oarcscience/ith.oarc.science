### SECTION VI

"Dhritarashtra said.---"Thou art intelligent, O Sanjaya, and acquainted
with the truth (about everything). Thou hast duly given a description of
the island in brief. Tell us now of the island in detail. Tell us now of
the dimension of the expanse of land that lies in the portion looking
like a hare. Thou mayst then speak of the portion resembling *peepul*
tree."

Vaisampayana said,--"Thus addressed by the king, Sanjaya began to say.

"Sanjaya said,--'Stretching from east to west, are these six mountains
that are equal <span id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35.md) and that extend from
the eastern to the western ocean. They are Himavat, Hemakuta, that best
of mountains called Nishadha, Nila abounding with stones of *lapis
lazuli*, Sweta white as the moon, and the mountains called Sringavat
composed of all kinds of metals. <span id="fr_36"></span>[3](#fn_36.md)
These are the six mountains, O king, which are always the resorts of
*Siddhas* and *Charanas*. The space lying between each of these measures
a thousand *Yojanas*, and thereon are many delightful kingdoms. And
these divisions are called *Varshas*, O Bharata. In all those kingdoms
reside creatures of diverse species. This (the land where we are) is in
the *Varsha* that is called after Bharata. Next to it (northwards) is
the *Varsha* called after Himavat. The land that is beyond Hemakuta is
called *Harivarsha*, South of the Nila range and on the north of the
Nishadha is a mountain, O king, called Malyavat that stretches from east
to west. Beyond Malyavat northwards is the mountain called
Gandhamadana. <span id="fr_37"></span>[4](#fn_37.md) Between these two
(*viz.*, Malyavat and Gandhamadana) is a globular mountain called Meru
made of gold. Effulgent as the morning sun, it is like fire without
smoke. <span id="fr_38"></span>[5](#fn_38.md) It is eighty-four thousand
Yojanas high, and, O king, its depth also is eighty-four Yojanas. It
standeth

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

bearing the worlds above, below and transversely. Besides Meru are
situated, O lord, these four islands, *viz.*, Bhadraswa, and Ketumala,
and Jamvudwipa otherwise called Bharata, and Uttar-Kuru which is the
abode of persons who have achieved the merit of righteousness. The bird
Sumukha, the son of Suparna, beholding that all the birds on Meru were
of golden plumage, reflected that he should leave that mountain inasmuch
as there was no difference between the good, middling, and bad birds.
The foremost of luminaries, the sun, always circumambulates Meru, as
also the moon with (his) attendant constellation, and the Wind-god too.
The mountain, O king, is endued with celestial fruits and flowers, and
it is covered all over with mansions made of furnished gold. There, on
that mountain, O king, the celestials, the *Gandharvas*, the *Asuras*,
and the *Rakshasas*, accompanied by the tribes of *Apsaras*, always
sport. There Brahman, and Rudra, and also Sakra the chief of the
celestials, assembled together, performed diverse kinds of sacrifices
with plentiful gifts. Tumvuru, and Narada and Viswavasu, and the Hahas
and the Huhus, repairing thither, adored the foremost of the celestials
with diverse hymns. The high-souled seven *Rishis*, and Kasyapa the lord
of creatures, repair thither, blessed be thou, on every *parva*
day. <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md) Upon the summit of that
mountain, Usanas, otherwise called the Poet, sporteth with the *Daityas*
(his disciples). <span id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_40.md) The jewels and gems
(that we see) and all the mountains abounding in precious stones are of
Meru. Therefrom a fourth part is enjoyed by the holy Kuvera. Only a
sixteenth part of that wealth he giveth unto men. On the northern side
of Meru is a delightful and excellent forest of *Karnikaras*, covered
with the flowers of every season, <span id="fr_41"></span>[3](#fn_41.md)
and occupying a range of hills. There the illustrious *Pasupati*
himself, the creator of all things, surrounded by his celestial
attendants and accompanied by Uma, sporteth bearing a chain of
*Karnikara* flowers (on his neck) reaching down to his feet, and blazing
with radiance with his three eyes resembling three risen suns. Him
*Siddhas* truthful in speech, of excellent vows and austere ascetic
penances, can behold. Indeed, Maheswara is incapable of being seen by
persons of wicked conduct. From the summit of that mountain, like a
stream of milk, O ruler of men, the sacred and auspicious Ganga,
otherwise called Bhagirathi, adored by the most righteous, of universal
form and immeasurable and issuing out with terrific noise, falleth with
impetuous force on the delightful lake of *Chandramas*. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[4](#fn_42.md) Indeed that sacred lake, like an ocean,
hath been formed by *Ganga* herself. (While leaping from the mountains),
Ganga, incapable of being supported by even the mountains, was held for
a hundred thousand years by the bearer of *Pinaka* 

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

on his head. <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md) On the western side of
Meru, O king, is *Ketumala*. <span id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_44.md) And
there also is *Jamvukhanda*. Both are great seats of humanity, O
king. <span id="fr_45"></span>[3](#fn_45.md) There, O Bharata, the measure
of human life is ten thousand years. The men are all of a golden
complexion, and the women are like *Apsaras*. And all the residents are
without sickness, without sorrow, and always cheerful. The men born
there are of the effulgence of melted gold. On the summits of
Gandhamadana, Kuvera the lord of the *Guhyakas*, with many *Rakshasas*
and accompanied by tribes of *Apsaras*, passeth his time in joy. Besides
Gandhamadana there are many smaller mountains and hills. The measure of
human life there is eleven thousand years. There, O king, the men are
cheerful, and endued with great energy and great strength and the women
are all of the complexion of the lotus and highly beautiful. Beyond
*Nila* is (the *Varsha* called) *Sweta*, beyond *Sweta* is (the *Varsha*
called) *Hiranyaka*. Beyond *Hiranyaka* is (the *Varsha* called)
*Airavata* covered with provinces. The last *Varsha* in the (extreme)
north and Bharata's *Varsha* in the (extreme) south are both, O king, of
the form of a bow. These five *Varshas* (*viz.*, *Sweta*, *Hiranyaka*,
*Elavrita*, *Harivarsha*, and *Haimavat-varsha*) are in the middle, of
which *Elavrita* exists in the very middle of all. Amongst these seven
*Varshas* (the five already mentioned and *Airavata* and *Bharata*) that
which is further north excels the one to its immediate south in respect
of these attributes, *viz.*, the period of life, stature, health,
righteousness, pleasure, and profit. In these *Varshas*, O Bharata,
creatures (though of diverse species) yet, live together. Thus, O king,
is Earth covered with mountains. The huge mountains of Hemakuta are
otherwise called Kailasa. There, O king, Vaisravana passeth his time in
joy with his *Guhyakas*. Immediately to the north of Kailasa and near
the mountains of Mainaka there is a huge and beautiful mountain called
*Manimaya* endued with golden summits. Beside this mountain is a large,
beautiful, crystal and delightful lake called *Vindusaras* with golden
sands (on its beach). There king Bhagiratha, beholding Ganga (since)
called after his own name, resided for many years. There may be seen
innumerable sacrificial stakes made of gems, and *Chaitya* tree made of
gold. It was there that he of a thousand eyes and great fame won
(ascetic) success by performing sacrifices. There the Lord of all
creatures, the eternal Creator of all the worlds, endued with supreme
energy surrounded by his ghostly attendants, is adored. There Nara and
Narayana, Brahman, and Manu, and Sthanu as the fifth, are (ever
present). And there the celestial stream Ganga having three
currents, <span id="fr_46"></span>[4](#fn_46.md) issuing out of the region
of Brahman, first showed herself, and then dividing

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

herself into seven streams, became Vaswokasara, Nalini, the
sin-cleansing Saraswati, Jamvunadi, Sita, Ganga and Sindhu as the
seventh. The Supreme Lord hath (himself) made the arrangement with
reference to that inconceivable and celestial stream. It is there
that <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md) sacrifices have been performed
(by gods and *Rishis*) on a thousand occasions after the end of the
*Yuga* (when creation begins). As regards the Saraswati, in some parts
(of her course) she becometh visible and in some parts not so. This
celestial sevenfold Ganga is widely known over the three worlds.
*Rakshasas* reside on Himavat, *Guhyakas* on Hemakuta, and serpents and
Nagas on Nishadha, and ascetics on Gokarna. The Sweta mountains are said
to be the abode of the celestial and the *Asuras*. The *Gandharvas*
always reside on Nishadhas, and the regenerate *Rishis* on Nila. The
mountains of Sringavat also are regarded as the resort of the
celestials.

"'These then, O great king, are the seven *Varshas* of the world as they
are divided. Diverse creatures, mobile <span
id="fr_48"></span>[2](#fn_48.md) and immobile, are placed in them all.
Diverse kinds of prosperity, both providential and human, are noticeable
in them. They are incapable of being counted. Those desirous, however,
of their own good believe (all this), I have now told thee of that
delightful region (of land) of the form of a hare about which thou hadst
asked me. At the extremities of that region are the two *Varshas*,
*viz.*, one on the north and the other on the south. Those two also have
now been told to thee. Then again the two islands *Naga-dwipa* and
*Kasyapa-dwipa* are the two ears of this region of the form of a hare.
The beautiful mountains of Maleya, O king, having rocks like plates of
copper, form another (prominent) part of Jamvudwipa that having its
shape resembling a hare.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_35"></span>[13:2](m06006.htm#fr_35.md) The Bombay text reads
*Varsha parvatas* for *parvatas samas*.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[13:3](m06006.htm#fr_36.md) For *Pinaddha*
occurring in the Bengal texts, the Bombay edition reads *Vichitra*.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[13:4](m06006.htm#fr_37.md) The Bengal texts add a
line here which is properly omitted in the Bombay edition.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[13:5](m06006.htm#fr_38.md) After the 10th occurs a
line in the Bengal text which is evidently vicious.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[14:1](m06006.htm#fr_39.md) Day of the full-moon
and that of the new-moon.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[14:2](m06006.htm#fr_40.md) The Bengal texts,
except the Burdwan one, have *divi* for *Daityas*, of course, the latter
reading is correct.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[14:3](m06006.htm#fr_41.md) The Bombay text has
*Sarvatas* (which is better) for *Sarvata* in the Bengal texts.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[14:4](m06006.htm#fr_42.md) in the first line of
28, the Bengal texts read *Sirasas* (ablative) for *Sikhhrat* of the
Bombay edition. In the last line of 29 also, the Bombay text has
*plavantiva-pravegena* for the Bengal reading *patatyajapravegena*. No
material difference of meaning arises if one or the other is accepted.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[15:1](m06006.htm#fr_43.md) Alluding to the
tradition of Siva's holding Ganga on his head and for which the great
god is sometimes called *Gangadhara*.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[15:2](m06006.htm#fr_44.md) This word occurs in
various forms, *Ketumala* and *Ketumali* being two others.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[15:3](m06006.htm#fr_45.md) The Bombay edition
reads *tu* for *cha* after *Jamvukhanda*. The meaning becomes changed.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[15:4](m06006.htm#fr_46.md) The sacred stream
*Ganga* is believed to have three currents. In heaven the current is
called *Mandakini*; on earth, it is called *Ganga*; and in the
subterraneous world it is called *Bhogavati*.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[16:1](m06006.htm#fr_47.md) The Bengal texts,
excepting the Burdwan one, incorrectly read *Sakram* for *Satram*.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[16:2](m06006.htm#fr_48.md) The correct reading is
*Gatimanti*. Many of the Bengal texts incorrectly read *matimanti*,
which is unmeaning.
