### SECTION LXXXVIII

"Vaisampayana said, 'Entering the palace of the Pandavas the
mighty-armed prince saluted his grand-mother in soothing and sweet
accents. Then queen Chitrangada, and (Ulupi) the daughter of (the snake)
Kauravya, together approached Partha and Krishna with humility. They
then met Subhadra and the other ladies of the Kuru race with due
formalities. Kunti gave them many gems and costly things. Draupadi and
Subhadra and the other ladies of Kuru's race all made presents to them.
The two ladies took up their residence there, using costly beds and
seats, treated with affection and

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

respect by Kunti herself from desire of doing what was agreeable to
Partha. King Vabhruvahana of great energy, duly honoured (by Kunti),
then met Dhritarashtra according to due rites. Repairing then to king
Yudhishthira and Bhima and the other Pandavas, the mighty prince of
Manipura saluted them all with humility. They all embraced him with
great affection and honoured him duly. And those mighty car-warriors
highly gratified with him, made large gifts of wealth unto him. The king
of Manipura then humbly approached Krishna, that hero armed with the
discus and the mace, like a second Pradyumna approaching his sire.
Krishna gave unto the king a very costly and excellent car adorned with
gold and unto which were yoked excellent steeds. Then king Yudhishthira
the just, and Bhima, and Phalguna, and the twins, each separately
honoured him and made costly presents unto him. On the third day, the
sage Vyasa, the son of Satyavati, that foremost of eloquent men,
approaching Yudhishthira said,--'From this day, O son of Kunti, do thou
begin thy sacrifice. The time for it has come. The moment for commencing
the rite is at hand. The priests are urging thee. Let the sacrifice be
performed in such a way that no limb may become defective. In
consequence of the very large quantity of gold that is required for this
sacrifice, it has come to be called the sacrifice of profuse gold. Do
thou also, O great king, make the Dakshina of this sacrifice three times
of what is enjoined. Let the merit of thy sacrifice increase threefold.
The Brahmanas are competent for the purpose. <span
id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_204.md) Attaining to the merits then of three
Horse-sacrifices, each with profuse presents, thou shalt be freed, O
king, from the sin of having slain thy kinsmen. The bath that one
performs upon completion of the Horse-sacrifice, O monarch, is highly
cleansing and productive of the highest merit. That merit will be thine,
O king of Kuru's race. Thus addressed by Vyasa of immeasurable
intelligence, the righteous-souled Yudhishthira of great energy
underwent the *Diksha* for performance of the Horse-sacrifice. <span
id="fr_205"></span>[2](#fn_205.md) The mighty-armed monarch then performed
the great Horse-sacrifice characterised by gifts of food and presents in
profusion and capable of fructifying every wish and producing every
merit. The priests, well conversant with the Vedas, did every rite duly,
moving about in all directions. They were all well-trained, and
possessed of omniscience. In nothing was there a swerving from the
ordinances and nothing was down improperly. Those foremost of regenerate
persons followed the procedure as laid down (in the scriptures) and as
it should be followed in those points about which no directions are
given. <span id="fr_206"></span>[3](#fn_206.md) Those best of regenerate
ones, having first performed the rite called *Pravargya*, otherwise
called *Dharma*, then

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

duly went through the rite of *Abhishava*, O king. <span
id="fr_207"></span>[1](#fn_207.md) Those foremost of Soma-drinkers, O
monarch, extracting the juice of the Soma, then performed the Savana
rite following the injunctions of the scriptures. Among those that came
to that sacrifice none could be seen who was cheerless, none who was
poor, none who was hungry, none who was plunged into grief, and none
that seemed to be vulgar. Bhimasena of mighty energy at the command of
the king, caused food to be ceaselessly distributed among those that
desired to eat. Following the injunctions of the scriptures, priests,
well-versed in sacrificial rites of every kind, performed every day all
the acts necessary to complete the great sacrifice. Amongst the
Sadasayas of king Yudhishthira of great intelligence there was none who
was not well conversant with the six branches of (Vedic). learning.
There was none among them that was not an observer of vows, none that
was not an Upadhyaya; none that was not well versed in dialectical
disputations. When the time came for erecting the sacrificial stake, O
chief of Bharata's race, six stakes were set up that were made of
Vilwa, <span id="fr_208"></span>[2](#fn_208.md) six that were made of
Khadira, and six that were made of Saravarnin. Two stakes were get up by
the priests that were made of Devadaru in that sacrifice of the Kuru
king, and one that was made of Sleshmataka. At the command of the king,
Bhima caused some other stakes to be set up, for the sake of beauty
only, that were made of gold. Adorned with fine cloths supplied by the
royal sage, those stakes shone there like Indra and the deities with the
seven celestial Rishis standing around them in Heaven. A number of
golden bricks were made for constructing therewith a *Chayana*. The
Chayana made resembled in beauty that which had been made for Daksha,
the lord of creatures (on the occasion of his great sacrifice). The
Chayana measured eight and ten cubits and four stories or lairs. A
golden bird, of the shape of Garuda, was then made, having three
angles. <span id="fr_209"></span>[3](#fn_209.md) Following the injunctions
of the scriptures, the priests possessed of great learning then duly
tied to the stakes both animals and birds, assigning each to its
particular deity. <span id="fr_210"></span>[4](#fn_210.md) Bulls, possessed
of such qualifications as are mentioned in the scriptures, and aquatic
animals were properly tied to the stakes after the rites relating to the
sacrificial fire had been performed. In that sacrifice of the
high-souled son of Kunti, three hundred animals were tied to the stakes
setup, including that foremost of steeds. That sacrifice looked
exceedingly beautiful as if adorned with the celestial Rishis, with the
Gandharvas singing in chorus and the diverse tribes of Apsaras

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

dancing in merriment. It teemed, besides, with Kimpurushas and was
adorned with Kinnaras. All around it were abodes of Brahmanas crowned
with ascetic success. There were daily seen the disciples of Vyasa,
those foremost of regenerate ones, who are compilers of all branches of
learning, and well conversant with sacrificial rites. There was Narada,
and there was Tumvuru of great splendour. There were Viswavasu and
Chitrasena and others, all of whom were proficient in music. At
intervals of the sacrificial rites, those Gandharvas, skilled in music
and well versed in dancing, used to gladden the Brahmanas who were
engaged in the sacrifice.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_204"></span>[151:1](m14088.htm#fr_204.md) The sense is this:
for a horse-sacrifice, the *Dakshina* or sacrificial present, payable to
the principal *Ritwija* or to be distributed among all the *Ritwijas*
including the other Brahmanas, is enjoined to be of a certain measure.
Vyasa advises Yudhishthira to make that *Dakshina* triple of what the
enjoined measure is. By thus increasing the *Dakshina*, the merit of the
sacrificer will increase correspondingly.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[151:2](m14088.htm#fr_205.md) The *Diksha* is the
ceremony of initiation. Certain *mantras* are uttered in which the
intention is declared of performing what is desired to be performed.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[151:3](m14088.htm#fr_206.md) The *Karma* of a
sacrifice or religious rite is the procedure. It is, of course, laid
down in the scriptures on the ritual. There are certain acts, however,
which, though not laid down, should be done agreeably to reasonable
inferences. What is said, therefore, in the second <span
id="page_152">p. 152</span> line of 20 is that the procedure was fully
followed, both as laid down and as consistent with inferences.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[152:1](m14088.htm#fr_207.md) *Pravargya* is a
special preliminary rite performed in a sacrifice. 'Abhishva' is the
extraction of the juice of the Soma plant after its consecration with
Mantras.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[152:2](m14088.htm#fr_208.md) Vitwa is the *Ægle
marmelos*, Linn. Khadira is *Acacia catechu*, Linn, or *Mimosa catechu*;
Saravarnin is otherwise called, as explained by Nilakantha, Palasa. It
is the *Butea frondosa* of Roxburgh. Devadaru is *Pinus Deodara* of
Roxburgh, or *Cedruz Deodara*. Sleshmataka is a small tree identified
with the *Cordia latifolia*. Here probably, some other tree is intended.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[152:3](m14088.htm#fr_209.md) It is difficult to
understand what these constructions or figures were. They were probably
figures drawn on the sacrificial altar, with gold-dust. At the present
day, powdered rice, coloured red, yellow, blue, etc, is used.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[152:4](m14088.htm#fr_210.md) Each animal is
supposed to be agreeable to a particular deity.
