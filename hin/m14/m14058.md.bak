### SECTION LVIII

"Vaisampayana said, 'Utanka, coming back to king Saudasa who was always
well-disposed towards all his friends, solicited him for some sign (to
convince Madayanti of the fact of his being really commissioned by the
king). That foremost one of Ikshwaku's race then gave him a sign.'

"Saudasa said, 'This my present condition is intolerable. I do not
behold any refuge. Knowing this to be my wish, do thou give away the
jewelled ear-rings.' <span id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_171.md) Thus
addressed by the king, Utanka went back to the queen and reported to her
the words of her lord. Hearing those words, the queen gave unto Utanka
her jewelled ear-rings. Having obtained the ear-rings, Utanka came back
to the king and said unto him, 'I desire to hear, O monarch, what the
import is of those mysterious words Which thou saidst as a sign to thy
queen.'

"Saudasa said, 'Kshatriyas are seen to honour the Brahmanas from the
very beginning of the creation. Towards the Brahmanas, however, many
offences arise (on the part of Kshatriyas). As regards myself, I am
always bent in humility before them. I am overtaken by a calamity
through a Brahmana. Possessed of Madayanti, I do not see any other
refuge. Indeed, O foremost of all persons having of a high goal, I do
not behold any other refuge for myself in the matter of approaching the
gates of Heaven, or in continuing here, O best of regenerate ones. It is
impossible for a king that is hostile to Brahmanas to continue living in
this world or in attaining to happiness in the next. Hence have I given
thee these my jewelled ear-rings which were coveted by thee. <span
id="fr_172"></span>[2](#fn_172.md) Do thou now keep the compact which thou
hast made with me today.'

"Utanka said, 'O king, I shall certainly act according to my promise. I
shall truly come back and place myself under thy power. There is,
however,

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

a question, O scorcher of foes, which I wish to ask thee.'

"Saudasa said, 'Say, O learned Brahmana, what is in thy mind. I shall
certainly reply unto thy words. I shall dispel whatever doubt may be in
thy mind. I have no hesitation in this.'

"Utanka said, 'Those who are skilled in the rules of duty say that
Brahmanas are of restrained speech. One who behaves wrongly towards
friends is regarded as vile as a thief.' <span
id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_173.md) Thou, again, O king, hast become my
friend today. Do thou then, O foremost of men, give me such counsel as
is approved by the wise. As regards myself, I have now obtained the
fruition of my wishes. Thou, again, art a cannibal. Is it proper for me
to come back to thee or not?'

"Saudasa said, 'If it is proper (for me), O foremost of superior
Brahmanas, to say what thou askest, I should then, O best of regenerate
ones, tell thee that thou shouldst never come back to me. O perpetuator
of Bhrigu's race, by acting even thus, thou wilt attain to what is
beneficial to thee. If thou comest back, O learned Brahmana, thou wilt
surely meet with death.'

"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the intelligent king in
respect of what was beneficial for him. Utanka took leave of the monarch
and set out for the presence of Ahalya. Desirous of doing what was
agreeable to the wife of his preceptor, he took the ear-rings with him
and set out with great speed for reaching the retreat of Gautama.
Protecting them even in the manner directed by Madayanti, that is,
binding them within the folds of his black deer-skin, he proceeded on
his way. After he had proceeded for some distance, he became afflicted
by hunger. He there beheld a *Vilwa* tree bent down with the weight of
(ripe) fruits. <span id="fr_174"></span>[2](#fn_174.md) He climbed that
tree. Causing his deer-skin, O chastiser of foes, to hang on a branch,
that foremost of regenerate persons then began to pluck some fruits.
While he was employed in plucking those fruits with eyes directed
towards them, some of them fell, O king, on that deerskin in which those
ear-rings had been carefully tied by that foremost of Brahmanas. With
the strokes of the fruits, the knot became untied. Suddenly that
deer-skin, with the ear-rings in it, fell down. When the knot being
unfastened, the deer-skin fell down on the ground, a snake who was there
beheld those jewelled ear-rings. That snake belonged to the race of
Airavata. With great promptness he took up the ear-rings in his mouth
and then entered an anthill. Beholding the ear-rings taken away by that
snake, Utanka, filled with wrath and in great anxiety of mind, came down
from the tree. Taking his staff he began to pierce that anthill. That
best of Brahmanas, burning with wrath and the desire for revenge,
ceaselessly [employed](errata.htm#8.md) himself for five and thirty days in
that task. The goddess Earth, unable to bear the force of Utanka's
walking staff and with body torn therewith, became exceedingly anxious.
Unto that

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

regenerate Rishi then, who continued to dig the Earth from desire of
making a path to the nether regions inhabited by the Nagas, the chief of
the celestials, armed with the thunder, came there, on his car drawn by
green horses. Endued with great energy, he beheld that foremost of
Brahmanas, as he sat there engaged in his task.'

"Vaisampayana continued, 'Assuming the garb of a Brahmana afflicted with
the sorrow of Utanka, the chief of the celestials addressed him, saying,
'This (purpose of thine) is incapable of being achieved. The regions of
the Nagas are thousands of Yojanas removed from this place. I think that
thy purpose is not capable of being achieved with thy walking staff.'

"Utanka said, 'If, O Brahmana, the ear-rings be not recovered by me from
the regions of the Nagas, I shall cast off my life-breaths before thy
eyes, O foremost of regenerate persons!'

"Vaisampayana said, 'When the thunder-armed Indra failed to divert
Utanka from his purpose, he united the latter's walking staff with the
force of thunder. Then, O Janamejaya, the Earth, opening with those
strokes having the force of thunder, yielded a way to the (nether)
regions inhabited by the Nagas. By that path Utanka entered the world of
Nagas. He saw that that region lay extended thousands of Yojanas on all
sides. Indeed, O blessed one, it was equipt with many walls made of pure
gold and decked with jewels and gems. There were many fine tanks of
water furnished with flights of stair-cases made of pure crystal, and
many rivers of clear and transparent water. He saw also many trees with
diverse species of birds perching on them. That perpetuator of Bhrigu's
race behold the gate of that region which was full five Yojanas high and
a hundred Yojanas in width. Beholding the region of the Nagas, Utanka
became very cheerless. Indeed, he, despaired of getting back the
earrings. Then there appeared unto him a black steed with a white tail.
His face and eyes were of a coppery hue, O thou of Kuru's race, and he
seemed to blaze forth with energy. Addressing Utanka, he said, 'Do thou
blow into the Apana duct of my body. Thou wilt then, O learned Brahmana,
get back thy ear-rings which have been taken away by a descendant of
Airavata's race! Do not loathe to do my bidding, O son. Thou didst it
often at the retreat of Gautama in former days.'

"Utanka said, 'How did I know thee in the retreat of my preceptor?
Indeed, I wish to hear how I did in those days what thou biddest me do
now.'

"The steed said, 'Know, O learned Brahmana, that I am the preceptor of
thy preceptor, for I am the blazing *Jatavedas* (deity of fire). By thee
I was often worshipped for the sake of thy preceptor, O child of
Bhrigu's race, duly and with a pure heart and body. For that reason I
shall accomplish what is for thy good. Do my bidding without delay.'
Thus addressed by the deity of fire, Utanka did as he was directed. The
deity then, gratified with him, blazed up for consuming everything. From
the pores of his body, O Bharata, in consequence of his very nature, a
thick smoke issued threatening terrors to the world of Nagas. With that
mighty and wide-spreading smoke, O Bharata, everything became enveloped
in gloom, so that nothing, O king, could any longer be seen in the world
of the Nagas. Cries of woe were heard throughout the mansions

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

of the Airavatas, uttered by the Nagas headed by Vasuki, O Janamejaya.
Enveloped by that smoke, the palaces could no longer be seen, O Bharata.
These resembled woods and hill overwhelmed by a thick forest. With eyes
that were red in consequence of that smoke, and afflicted by the energy
of the deity of fire, the Nagas came out of their mansions to the
high-souled son of Bhrigu's race for ascertaining what was the matter.
Having heard what the matter was from that ascetic of immeasurable
energy, all the Nagas, with fear depicted on their eyes, offered him
their worship according to due forms. Indeed, all the Nagas placing the
old and the young one's before them, bowed unto him with their heads and
joining their hands addressed him, saying, 'Be gratified with us, O holy
one!' Having gratified that Brahmana and offered him water to wash his
feet and the ingredients of the Arghya (for honouring him), the Nagas
gave him those celestial and highly-adored ear-rings. Thus honoured by
them, Utanka of great prowess, circumambulating the deity of fire,
started for the retreat of his preceptor. Indeed, repairing quickly to
Gautama's asylum, O king, he presented those ear-rings unto the wife of
his preceptor, O sinless one. That best of Brahmanas also told his
preceptor everything about Vasuki and the other Nagas that had occurred.
It was even thus, O Janamejaya, that the high-souled Utanka, having
wandered through the three worlds, fetched those jewelled ear-rings (for
his preceptor's wife). Of such prowess, O chief of Bharata's race, was
the ascetic Utanka. So austere were the penances with which he was
endued. I have thus told thee what thou hadst asked me.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_171"></span>[103:1](m14058.htm#fr_171.md) These words of the
king are intended to be reported to his queen who would understand the
allusion. The sense is this: cursed by Vasishtha, I have become a
cannibal. My condition is intolerable. By this gift of the ear-rings to
a deserving Brahmana, much merit may arise. That merit may relieve me.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[103:2](m14058.htm#fr_172.md) This also is an
allusion to the dreadful curse of Vasishtha. The king refers to
Madayanti as his only refuge. She may save him by doing an act or
special merit, *viz.*, giving away her costly ear-rings to a truly
deserving Brahmana.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[104:1](m14058.htm#fr_173.md) The sense is this: a
Brahmana is never loose of tongue. He is truthful. Hence, having passed
my word to thee about my return, thou mayst be sure that I would keep my
word. One, again, that acts improperly towards a friend, comes to be
regarded as a thief. By this, Utanka reminds the king that he should not
inflict any wrong on him by carrying out his intention of eating him up.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[104:2](m14058.htm#fr_174.md) Vilwa is the *Aegle
marmalos*.
