### SECTION XLIII

"Brahmana said, 'Among men, the royal Kshatriya is (endued with) the
middle quality. Among vehicles, the elephant (is so); and among denizens
of the forest the lion; among all (sacrificial) animals, the sheep;
among all those that live in holes, is the snake; among cattle, the
bovine bull; among females, the mule. <span
id="fr_124"></span>[4](#fn_124.md) There is no doubt in this that in this
world, the Nyagrodha, the Jamvu, the Pippala, the Salmali, and Sinsapa,
the Meshasringa, and the Kichaka, are the foremost ones among
trees. <span id="fr_125"></span>[5](#fn_125.md) Himavat, Patipatra, Sahya,

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Vindhya, Trikutavat, Sweta, Nila, Bhasa,
Koshthavat, Guruskandha, Mahendra and Malayavat,--these are the foremost
of mountains. Likewise the Maruts are the foremost of the Ganas. Surya
is the lord of all the planets, and Chandramas of all the
constellations. Yama is the lord of the Pitris; Ocean is the lord of all
rivers. Varuna is the king of the waters. Indra is said to be the king
of the Maruts. Arka is the king of all hot bodies, and Indra of all
luminous bodies. Agni is the eternal lord of the elements, and
Vrihaspati of the Brahmanas. Soma is the lord of (deciduous) herbs, and
Vishnu is the foremost of all that are endued with might. Tashtri is the
king of Rudras, and Siva of all creatures. Sacrifice is the foremost of
all initiatory rites, and Maghavat of the deities. The North is the lord
of all the points of the compass; Soma of great energy is the lord of
all learned Brahmanas. Kuvera is the lord of all precious gems, and
Purandara of all the deities. Such is the highest creation among all
entities. Prajapati is the lord of all creatures. Of all entities
whatever, I, who am full of Brahman, am the foremost. There is no entity
that is higher than myself or Vishnu. The great Vishnu, who is full of
Brahman, is the king of kings over all. Know him to be the ruler, the
creator, the uncreated Hari. He is the ruler of men and Kinnaras and
Yakshas and Gandharvas, and Snakes and Rakshasas, and deities and
Danavas and Nagas. Among those that are followed by persons full of
desire is the great goddess Maheswari of beautiful eyes. She is
otherwise called by the name of Parvati. Know that the goddess Uma is
the foremost and the most auspicious of women. Among women that are a
source of pleasure, the foremost are the Apsaras who are possessed of
great splendour. <span id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_126.md) Kings are
desirous of acquiring piety, and Brahmanas are causeways of piety.
Therefore, the king should always strive to protect the twice-born ones.
Those kings in whose dominions good men languish are regarded as bereft
of the virtues of their order. Hereafter they have to go into wrong
paths. Those kings in whose dominions good men are protected, rejoice in
this world and enjoy happiness hereafter. Verily, those high-souled ones
attain to the highest seat. Understand this, ye foremost of regenerate
ones. I shall after this state the everlasting indications of duties.
Abstention from injury is the highest duty. Injury is an indication of
unrighteousness. Splendour is the indication of the deities. Men have
acts for their indications. Ether (or space) has sound for its
characteristic. Wind has touch for its characteristic. The
characteristic of lighted bodies is colour, and water has taste for its
characteristic. Earth, which holds all entities, has smell for its
characteristic. Speech has words for its characteristic, refined into
vowels and consonants. Mind has thought for its characteristic. Thought
has, again, been said to be the characteristic of the understanding. The
things thought of by the mind are ascertained with accuracy by the
understanding. There is no doubt in this, *viz.*, that the
understanding, by perseverance, perceives all things. The characteristic
of mind is meditation. The

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

characteristic of the good man is to live unperceived. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_127.md) Devotion has acts for its
characteristic. Knowledge is the characteristic of renunciation.
Therefore keeping knowledge, before his view, the man of understanding
should practise renunciation. The man who has betaken himself to
renunciation and who is possessed of knowledge, who transcends all pairs
of opposites, as also darkness, death, and decrepitude, attains to the
highest goal. I have thus declared to you duty what the indications are
of duty. I shall, after this, tell you of the seizure (comprehension) of
qualities. Smell, which appertains to earth, is seized by the nose. The
wind, that dwells in the nose is likewise appointed (as an agent) in the
perception of smell. Taste is the essence of water. That is seized by
the tongue. Soma, who resides in the tongue, is appointed likewise in
the perception of taste. The quality of a lighted body is colour. That
is seized by the eye. Aditya who always resides in the eye has been
appointed in the perception of colour. Touch always appertains to the
wind (as its quality). That is perceived by the skin. The wind that
always resides in the skin has been appointed in apprehending touch. The
quality of ether is sound. That is seized by the ear. All the quarters,
which reside in the ear, have been appointed in apprehending sound. The
quality of the mind is thought. That is seized by the understanding. The
upholder of consciousness, residing in the heart, has been appointed in
apprehending the mind. The understanding is apprehended in the form of
determination or certitude, and Mahat in the form of knowledge. The
unperceived (Prakriti) has been, it is evident, appointed for the
seizure of all things after certitude. There is no doubt in this. <span
id="fr_128"></span>[2](#fn_128.md) The Kshetrajna which is eternal and is
destitute of qualities as regards its essence, is incapable of being
seized by symbols. Hence, the characteristic of the Kshetrajna, which is
without symbols, is purely knowledge. The unmanifest resides in the
symbol called Kshetra, and is that in which the qualities are produced
and absorbed. I always see, know, and hear it (though) it is hidden.
Purusha knows it: therefore is he called Kshetrajna. The Kshetrajna
perceives also the operations of the qualities and absence of their
operations. The qualities, which are created repeatedly, do not know
themselves, being unintelligent, as entities to be created and endued
with a beginning, middle, and end. No one else attains, only the
Kshetrajna attains, to that which is the highest and great and which
transcend the qualities and those entities which are born of the
qualities. Hence one who understands duties, casting off qualities and
the understanding, and having his sins destroyed, and transcending the
qualities, enters the Kshetrajna. One that is free from all pairs of
opposites, that never bends his head to any one, that is divested of
Swaha, that is immovable, and homeless, is the Kshetrajna. He is the
Supreme Lord."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_121"></span>[72:1](m14042.htm#fr_121.md) I do not think that
Telang is correct in his version of this verse. What is said here seems
to be this. The body is, as it were the wheel of Time; the body is the
ocean of delusion; the body is the creator, destroyer and reawakener of
the universe. Through the body creatures act, and hence creation,
destruction, and re-creation are due to the body. This accords with what
is said elsewhere regarding the body.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[72:2](m14042.htm#fr_122.md) It would be wrong to
take *satah* as implying 'the good,' the finite verses in every text
being singular.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[72:3](m14042.htm#fr_123.md) The correct reading
seems to be *atmana* as the last word of the first line, and not
*atman*.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[72:4](m14043.htm#fr_124.md) What is said here is
that the quality of passion predominates in these.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[72:5](m14043.htm#fr_125.md) Nyagrodha is the
*Ficus Bengalensis, Linn*. Jamvu is *Eugenia Jambolana, Lamk*. Pippala
is *Ficus religiosa, Linn*. Salmali is *Bombax Malabaricum*. Sinsapa is
*Dalbergia Sissoo, Roxb*. Meshasringa is *Asclepia geminata, Roxb*.
Kichaka is a variety of mountain bamboo. Here however it evidently
implies the Nimba or *Melia Azadirachta, Linn*.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[73:1](m14043.htm#fr_126.md) Nilakantha is for
taking the second line as consisting of two propositions. It would be
better to take *satinam* as referring to *strinam*, and *vasumatyah*, as
an adjective of *Apsarasah*.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[74:1](m14043.htm#fr_127.md) The sense seems to be
that good men never allow others to know what their acts are. They are
strangers to ostentation.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[74:2](m14043.htm#fr_128.md) The sense seems to be
that the knowledge of one's own identity and of things as discriminated
from one another is presided over by *Prakriti*. If the question is
asked whence is the knowledge--'I am so,' and that 'this is so,' the
answer is that it comes from Prakriti or Nature.
