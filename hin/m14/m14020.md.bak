### SECTION XX

"Vasudeva said, 'In this connection is cited the ancient narrative, O
son of Pritha, of the discourse that took place between a married
couple. A certain Brahmana's spouse, beholding the Brahmana, her husband
who was a complete master of every kind of knowledge and wisdom, seated
in seclusion, said unto him,--Into what region shall I go, depending on
thee as my husband,--thee that art seated, having cast off all
(religious) acts, that art harsh in thy conduct towards me, and that art
so undiscerning? <span id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md) It has been heard
by us that a wife attains to those regions which are acquired by her
husband. What, indeed, is the goal that I shall attain, having obtained
thee for my husband?--Thus questioned, that Brahmana of tranquil soul
then said unto her, smilingly,--O blessed dame, I am not offended with
these words of thine, O sinless one. Whatever acts exist that are
adopted with the aid of others, that are seen (in consequence of their
grossness), and that are true, are done as acts by men

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

devoted to acts. <span id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md) Those persons that
are destitute of knowledge, only store delusion by acts. Freedom from
acts, again, is incapable of being attained in this world for even a
moment. From birth to the attainment of a different form, action good or
bad, and accomplished by acts, mind, or speech, exists in all beings.
Those paths (of action) which are characterised by visible objects (such
as Soma-juice and ghee for libations) being destroyed by Rakshasas,
turning away from them I have perceived the seat (of the soul) that is
in the body, without the aid of the soul. <span
id="fr_47"></span>[2](#fn_47.md) There dwells Brahma transcending all pairs
of opposites; there Soma with Agni: and there the urger of the
understanding (*viz.*, Vayu) always moves, upholding all
creatures. <span id="fr_48"></span>[3](#fn_48.md) It is for that seat that
the Grandsire Brahman and others, concentrated in Yoga, worship the
Indestructible. It is for that seat that men of learning and excellent
vows, of tranquil souls, and of senses completely vanquished,
strive. <span id="fr_49"></span>[4](#fn_49.md) That is not capable of being
smelt by the sense of smell; nor tasted by the tongue; or touched by the
organs of touch. It is by the mind that that is attained. It is
incapable of being conquered by the eye. It transcends the sense of
hearing. It is destitute of scent, taste, touch, and form as attributes.
It is that from which proceeds the well-ordained universe, and it is
that upon which it rests. The life-breaths called Prana and Apana and
Samana and Vyana and Udana flow from it, and it is that into which they
again enter. The breaths Prana and Apana move between Samana and Vyana.
When the soul sleeps, both Samana and Vyana are absorbed. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[5](#fn_50.md) Between Apana and Prana, Udana dwells,
pervading all. Hence, Prana and Apana do not desert a sleeping person.
In consequence of its controlling all the life-winds, the controlling
breath is called Udana. Hence, utterers of Brahman undergo penances
which have myself for their goal. <span id="fr_51"></span>[6](#fn_51.md) In
the midst of all those life-breaths that swallow up one another and move
within the body, blazes forth the fire called Vaiswanara made up of
seven flames. The nose, the tongue, the eye, the skin, the ear which
numbers the fifth, the mind, and the understanding,--these are the seven
tongues of that Vaiswanara's flame. That which is smelt, that which is
seen, that which is drunk, that which is touched, as also that which is
heard, that

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

which is thought of, and that which is understood,--these are the seven
sorts of fuel for me. That which smells, that which eats, that which
sees, that which touches, that which hears numbering the fifth; that
which thinks, and that which understands,--these are the seven great
officiating priests. Behold, O blessed one, learned sacrificers duly
casting seven libations in seven ways in the seven fires, *viz.*, that
which is smelt, that which is drunk, that which is seen, that which is
touched, as also that which is heard, that which is thought of, and that
which is understood, create them in their own wombs. <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](m14021.htm#fn_52.md) Earth, Wind, Ether, Water, and
Light numbering as the fifth, Mind, and Understanding--these seven are
called wombs (of all things). All the attributes which constitute the
sacrificial offerings, enter into the attribute that is born of the
fire, and having dwelt within that dwelling became reborn in their
respective wombs. Thither also, *viz.*, in that which generates all
beings, they remain absorbed during the period for which dissolution
lasts. From that is produced smell, from that is produced taste, from
that is produced colour, and from that is produced touch; from that is
produced sound; from that arises doubt; and from that is produced
resolution. This is what is known as the sevenfold creation. It is in
this very way that all this was comprehended by the ancients. By the
three full and final libations, the full become full with light.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_45"></span>[36:2](m14020.htm#fr_45.md) *Avichakshanam* is
undiscerning, in the sense of the husband's not knowing that the
interrogatrix as wife, has no other refuge than her lord with all his
defects.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[37:1](m14020.htm#fr_46.md) I follow Nilakantha.
Telang adopts the views or Arjuna Misra and renders the first line as
'whatever acts are seized (by the touch, or seen, or heard, etc.')
*Grahyam*, according to Nilakantha, implies those acts, like Diksha,
etc, which are adopted with the aid of others.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[37:2](m14020.htm#fr_47.md) This seat, says
Nilakantha, is called *Avimukta* and lies between the eyebrows and the
nose.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[37:3](m14020.htm#fr_48.md) Nilakantha interprets
this mystically. By *Soma* he understands the artery or duct called
*Ida*, and by *Agni* the duct called *Pingala*. Dhira is *Buddipreraka*;
*vyavayam* is *sancharam*. *Dhirobhutani dharayan nityam vyavayam
kurute* is the order of the words. The sense is this: in this spot is
seated Brahman; there *Ida* and *Pingala* meet; and there also is *Vayu*
which urges the understanding and upholds all living creatures.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[37:4](m14020.htm#fr_49.md) *Yatra* is not to be
taken as a locative here. It is equivalent to *yatah* or for which.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[37:5](m14020.htm#fr_50.md) *Tasmin* is taken, by
Nilakantha as *Apana sahite Prane*.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[37:6](m14020.htm#fr_51.md) *Utkarshena anayati*,
hence Udana, says Nilakantha. The sense of the whole passage seems to be
this. Worldly life is regulated by the life-breaths. These are attached
to the Soul and lead to its individual manifestations. Udana controls
all the breaths. Udana is controlled by penance. It is penance then that
destroys the round of rebirths and leads to absorption into Brahman.
