### SECTION XXXI

"The Brahmana said, 'There are three foes in the world. They are said to
be ninefold, agreeably to their qualities. Exultation, satisfaction, and
joy,--these three qualities appertain to Goodness. <span
id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md) Cupidity, wrath, and hatred, these three
qualities are said to appertain to Passion. Lassitude, procrastination,
and delusion, these three qualities appertain to darkness. Cutting these
with showers of arrows, the man of intelligence, free from
procrastination, possessed of a tranquil soul, and with his senses under
subjection, ventures to vanquish others. <span
id="fr_84"></span>[2](#fn_84.md) In this connection, persons conversant
with (the occurrence of) ancient cycles recite some verses which were
sung in days of old by king Amvarisha who had acquired a tranquil soul.
When diverse kinds of faults were in the ascendant and when the
righteous were afflicted, Amvarisha of great fame put forth his strength
for assuming sovereignty. <span id="fr_85"></span>[3](#fn_85.md) Subduing
his own faults and worshipping the righteous, he attained to great
success and sang these verses.--I have subdued many faults. I have
killed all foes. But there is one, the greatest, vice which deserves to
be destroyed but which has not been destroyed by me! Urged by that
fault, this Jiva fails to attain to freedom from desire. Afflicted by
desire, one runs into ditches without knowing it. Urged by that fault,
one indulges in acts that are forbidden. Do thou cut off, cut off, that
cupidity with sharp-edged swords. From cupidity arise desires. From
desire flows anxiety. The man who yields to desire acquires many
qualities that appertain to passion. When these have been acquired, he
gets

many qualities that appertain to Darkness. In consequence of those
qualities, he repeatedly takes birth, with the bonds of body united, and
is impelled to action. Upon the expiration of life, with body becoming
dismembered and scattered, he once meets with death which is due to
birth itself. <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](m14032.htm#fn_86.md) Hence, duly
understanding this, and subduing cupidity by intelligence, one should
desire for sovereignty in one's soul. This is (true) sovereignty. There
is no other sovereignty here. The soul, properly understood, is the
king. Even these were the verses sung by king Ambarisha of great
celebrity, on the subject of sovereignty which he kept before him,--that
king who had cut off the one foremost fault *viz.*, cupidity.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_83"></span>[54:1](m14031.htm#fr_83.md) *Praharsha*, rendered
'exultation', is explained by Nilakantha as the joy that is felt at the
certainty of attaining what is desired. *Priti* is that satisfaction
which is felt when the object desired is attained. *Ananda* is what
arises while enjoying the attained object.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[54:2](m14031.htm#fr_84.md) The sense seems to be
this. Having first conquered the internal foes mentioned, the man of
intelligence, bent on effecting his deliverance, should then seek to
vanquish all external foes standing in his way.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[54:3](m14031.htm#fr_85.md) Nilakantha explains
that *dosha* here refers to attachment, cupidity and the rest; while
*Sadhu* implies not men but the virtues of tranquillity and the rest.
