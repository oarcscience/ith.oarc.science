### SECTION XXXIX

"Brahmana said, 'The qualities are incapable of being declared as
completely separate from one another. Passion and Goodness and Darkness
are seen existing in a state of union. They are attached to one another.
They depend on one another. They have one another for their refuge. They
likewise follow one another. As long as goodness exists, so long does
Passion exist. There is no doubt in this. As long as Darkness and
Goodness exist, so long does Passion exist. They make their journey
together, in union, and moving collectively. They, verily, move in body,
when they act with cause or without cause. Of all these which act with
one another, however, much they may differ in their development, the
manner in which their increase and diminution take place will now be
declared. There where Darkness exists in an increased measure, in the
lower creatures (for example), Passion exists in a smaller measure and
Goodness in a measure that is still less. There where Passion exists in
a copious measure, in creatures of middle course, Darkness exists in a
smaller measure and Goodness in a measure that is still less. There
where Goodness exists in a copious measure, in creatures of upward
courses, Darkness should be known to exist in a small measure and
Passion in a measure that is still less. Goodness is the spring that
causes the modifications of the senses. It is the great enlightener. No
duty has been laid down that is higher than Goodness. They who abide in
Goodness proceed upwards. They who abide in Passion remain in the
middle. They who abide in Darkness, being characterised by qualities
that are low, sink downwards. Darkness occurs in the Sudra; Passion in
the Kshatriya; and Goodness, which is the highest, in the Brahmana. The
three qualities exist even thus in the three orders. Even from a
distance, the three qualities of darkness and Goodness and Passion, are
seen to exist in a state of union and more collectively. They are never
seen in a state of separation. <span id="fr_109"></span>[2](#fn_109.md)

distress. The Sun is Goodness developed, men of evil deeds represent
Darkness; the heat which travellers on their way feel is said to be a
quality of Passion. The sun representing light is Goodness; the heat is
the quality of Passion; the shading (or eclipse) of the sun on Parvana
days should be known to represent Darkness. Even thus, the three
qualities exist in all luminous bodies. They act by turns in diverse
places in diverse ways. Among immobile objects, the quality of Darkness
exists in a very large measure. The qualities appertaining to Passion
are those properties of theirs which undergo constant changes. Their
oleaginous attributes appertain to Goodness. <span
id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110.md) The Day should be understood as
threefold. The Night has been ordained to be threefold. So also are
fortnight, months, years, seasons, and conjunctions. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[2](#fn_111.md) The gifts that are wide are threefold.
Threefold is sacrifice that flows. Threefold are the worlds; threefold
the deities; threefold is knowledge; and threefold the path or end. The
past, the Present. and the Future; Religion, Wealth. and Pleasure.
Prana, Apana, and Udana; these also are fraught with the three
qualities. Whatever object exists in this world, everything in it is
fraught with the three qualities. The three qualities act by turns in
all things and in all circumstances. Verily, the three qualities always
act in an unmanifest form. The creation of those three, *viz.*,
Goodness, Passion, and Darkness is eternal. The unmanifest, consisting
of the three qualities, is said to be darkness, unperceived, holy,
Constant. unborn, womb, eternal. Nature, change or modification,
destruction, Pradhana, production, and absorption, undeveloped, not
small (*i.e.*, vast), unshaking, immovable, fixed, existent, and
non-existent. All these names should be known by those who meditate on
matters connected with the soul. That person who accurately knows all
the names of the unmanifest, and the qualities, as also the pure
operations (of the qualities), is well conversant with the truth about
all distinctions and freed from the body, becomes liberated from all the
qualities and enjoys absolute happiness.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_109"></span>[66:2](m14039.htm#fr_109.md) 'From even a
distance.' implies that upon even a cursory view; without even being
examined minutely.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[67:1](m14039.htm#fr_110.md) What is said here is
this: the three qualities exist in even the immobile objects of the
universe. As regards Darkness, it predominates in them. As regards
Passion, it dwells in such properties of theirs as pungency, sourness,
sweetness, etc, which change with time or in consequence of cooking or
through admixture. Their only properties are said to appertain to
Goodness. *Tiryagbhavagatam* is explained by Nilakantha as *adhikyam
gatam*. Telang thinks this is unwarrantable. His own version, however,
of the first line is untenable. What can be the *tiryagbhava* or 'form
of lower species' of immobile objects? Telang frequently forgets that
Nilakantha represents a school of interpretation not founded by him but
which existed from a time long anterior to him.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[67:2](m14039.htm#fr_111.md) 'Conjunctions' are
evidently the periods joining the seasons, *i.e.*, the close of one
season and the beginning of another.
