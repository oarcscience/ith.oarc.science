### SECTION XXXIII

"The [Brahmana](errata.htm#3.md) said, 'I do not, O timid one, move in this
world in that manner which thou, according to thy own understanding,
censurest. I am a Brahmana possessed of Vedic knowledge, I am
emancipated. I am a forest recluse. I am an observer of the duties of a
house-holder. I observe vows. I am not what thou seest me in good and
bad acts. By me is pervaded everything that exists in this universe.
Whatever creatures exist in the world, mobile or immobile, know that I
am the destroyer of them all, even as fire is (the destroyer) of all
kinds of wood. Of sovereignty over the whole Earth or over Heaven (on
the one hand), or this knowledge (of my identity with the universe),
this knowledge is my wealth. <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92.md) This is
the one path for Brahmanas, by which they who understand it proceed to
house-holds, or abodes in the forest, or residence with preceptors, or
among mendicants. <span id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_93.md) With numerous
unconfused symbols, only one knowledge is worshipped. Those who,
whatever the symbols and modes of life to which they adhere, have
acquired an understanding having tranquillity for its essence, attain to
that one entity even as numerous rivers all meeting the Ocean. <span
id="fr_94"></span>[3](#fn_94.md) The path is traversable with the aid of
the understanding and not of this body. Actions have both beginning and
end, and the body has actions for its bonds. <span
id="fr_95"></span>[4](#fn_95.md) Hence, O blessed lady, thou needst have no
apprehension in respect of the world hereafter. With thy heart intent
upon the real entity, it is my soul into which thou wilt come.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_92"></span>[57:1](m14033.htm#fr_92.md) The sense seems to be
this. The sovereignty of the whole Earth or of Heaven, and this
knowledge of my identity with the universe--of these two alternatives, I
would freely choose the latter. Hence, he says--'This knowledge is my
wealth.'

<span id="fn_93"></span>[57:2](m14033.htm#fr_93.md) These are different
modes of life.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[57:3](m14033.htm#fr_94.md) The sense is this: the
knowledge to be acquired is that all is one. Diverse ways there are for
acquiring it. Those, again, that have attained to tranquillity have
acquired it.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[57:4](m14033.htm#fr_95.md) Actions are perishable
and can lead to no lasting result. It is by the understanding that that
knowledge, leading to what is permanent, is to be attained.
