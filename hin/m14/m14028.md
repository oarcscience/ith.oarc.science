### SECTION XXVIII

"The Brahmana said, 'I do not smell scents. I do not perceive tastes. I
do not see colours. I do not touch. I do not likewise hear the diverse
sounds (that arise). Nor do I entertain purposes of any kind. It is
Nature that desires such objects as are liked; it is Nature that hates
such objects as are disliked. Desire and aversion spring from Nature,
after the manner of the upward and the downward life-winds when souls
have entered animate bodies. Separated from them are others; in them are
eternal dispositions; (these as also) the soul of all creatures, Yogins
would behold in the body. Dwelling in that, I am never attached to
anything through desire and wrath, and decrepitude and death. Not having
any desire for any object of desire, and not having any aversion for any
evil, there is no taint on my natures, as there is no taint of a drop of
water on (the leaves of) the lotus. Of this constant (principle) which
looks upon diverse natures, they are inconstant possessions. <span
id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76.md) Though actions are performed, yet the
assemblage of enjoyments does not attach itself to them, even as the
assemblage of rays of the sun does not attach to the sky. In this
connection is recited an ancient story of a discourse between an
Adhwaryu and a Yati. Do thou hear it, O glorious lady. Beholding an
animal sprinkled with water at a sacrificial ceremony, a Yati said unto
the Adhwaryu seated there these words in censure,--This is destruction
of life! unto him the Adhwaryu said in reply,--This goat will not be
destroyed. The animal (sacrificed) meets with great good, if the Vedic
declaration on this subject be true. That part of this animal which is
of earth will go to earth. That part of this one which is born of water,
will enter into water. His eye will enter the sun; his ear will enter
the different points of the horizon; his life-winds will enter the sky.
I who adhere to the scriptures incur no fault (by assisting at the
killing of this animal).'

"The Yati said, 'If thou beholdest such good to the goat in this
dissociation with (his) life-winds, then this sacrifice is for the goat.
What need hast thou for it? Let the brother, father, mother, and friend
(of this goat) give thee their approval in this. Taking him (to them) do
thou consult them. This goat is especially dependent. It behoveth thee
to see them who can give their consent in this. After hearing their
consent; the matter will become fit for consideration. The life-winds of
this goat have been made to return to

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

their respective sources. Only the inanimate body remains behind. This
is what I think. Of those who wish to enjoy felicity by means of the
inanimate body (of an animal) which is comparable with fuel, the fuel
(of sacrifice) is after all the animal himself. Abstention from cruelty
is the foremost of all deities. Even this is the teaching of the elders.
We know this is the proposition, *viz.*,--No slaughter (of living
creatures).--If I say anything further, (it will then appear that)
diverse kinds of faulty actions are capable of being done by thee.
Always abstaining from cruelty to all creatures is what meets with our
approbation. We establish this from what is directly perceptible. We do
not rely on what is beyond direct perception.'

"The Adhwaryu said, 'Thou enjoyest the properties of smell which belong
to the earth. Thou drinkest the tastes which appertain to water. Thou
seest colours which belong to lighted bodies. Thou touchest the
properties which, have their origin in wind. Thou hearest the sounds
which have their origin in space (or ether). Thou thinkest thoughts with
the mind. All these entities, thou art of opinion, have life. Thou dost
not then abstain from taking life. Really, thou art engaged in
slaughter. There can be no movement without slaughter. Or, what dost
thou think, O regenerate one.'

"The Yati said, 'The Indestructible and the Destructible constitute the
double manifestation of the soul. Of these the Indestructible is
existed. The Destructible is said to be exceedingly non-existent. <span
id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_77.md) The life-wind, the tongue, the mind, the
quality of goodness, along with the quality of passion, are all
existent. The Atman is above these forms and hence is without duality
and hope. As regards one that is freed from these existent objects, that
transcends all pairs of [opposites](errata.htm#2.md), that does not cherish
any expectation, that is alike to all creatures, that is liberated from
the idea of *meum*, that has subjugated his self, and that is released
from all his surroundings,--for him no fear exists from any
source!' <span id="fr_78"></span>[2](#fn_78.md)

"The Adhwaryu said, 'O foremost of intelligent men, one should reside
with those that are good. Hearing thy opinion my understanding shines
with light. O illustrious one, I come to thee, believing thee to be a
god; and I say I have no fault, O regenerate one, by performing these
rites with the aid of Mantras!' <span id="fr_79"></span>[3](#fn_79.md)

"The Brahmana continued, 'With this conclusion, the Yati remained silent
after this. The Adhwaryu also proceeded with the great sacrifice, freed
from delusion. The Brahmanas understand Emancipation, which is

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

exceedingly subtle, to be of this kind and having understood it, they
live accordingly directed by the Kshetrajna, that beholder of all
topics.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_76"></span>[49:1](m14028.htm#fr_76.md) The correct reading is
*bhavantyanityah* and *vahuswabhavan*.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[50:1](m14028.htm#fr_77.md) *Swabhava* is explained
by Nilakantha as *sutaram abhava*.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[50:2](m14028.htm#fr_78.md) The sense seems to be
this; the life-winds indicate the operations of the several organs of
action: the tongue, which stands here for all the organs of perception,
of the sensual perceptions; the mind, of all the internal operations;
the quality of goodness, of all pleasure; and the quality of passion, of
all kinds of pain. These, therefore include the whole external and the
internal worlds. He that is free from these, transcends sin, for sin is
destroyed by freedom from these, knowledge being the means of attaining
to that freedom.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[50:3](m14028.htm#fr_79.md) 'I have no fault
etc.'--The sense seems to be that by doing these rites with the aid of
Mantras I have done that which has been approved from ages past by those
who have always been regarded wise. My eyes, however, have now been
opened by thee. I should not be held responsible for what I did while I
was ignorant.
