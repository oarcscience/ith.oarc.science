As such may I gain strength, O Agni.  
36 Store milk in earth and milk in plants, milk in the sky and  
milk in air.  
Teeming with milk for me he all the regions.  
37 Thee by the radiant Savitar's impulsion, with arms of Asvins,  
with the hands of Pûshan,  
Controlled by Vâk Sarasvatî's Controller, with Agni's sole  
dominion I besprinkle.

The plants are his Apsarases, namely Delights. May he  
protect this our Priesthood and Nobility. To him All-hail!  
Ave! To those All-hail!

48 Give lustre to our holy priests, set lustre in our ruling chiefs  
Lustre to Vaisyas, Sûdras: give, through lustre; lustre unto  
me.  
49 I ask this of thee with my prayer, adoring: thy worshipper  
asks this with his oblations.  
Varuna, stay thou here and be not angry: steal not our life  
from us, O thou Wide-Ruler.  
50 Heaven-like is Warmth, Hail! Heaven-like is Arka, Hail!  
Heaven-like is the Bright One, Hail! Heaven-like is Light,  
Hail! Heaven-like is Sûrya, Hail!  
51 I yoke with power and flowing butter Agni, divine, strong-  
pinioned, great with vital vigour.  
Through him may we approach the Bright One's station,  
ascending to the loftiest sky, to heaven.  
52 With these thy two ne’er-wasting feathered pinions wherewith  
thou drivest fiends away, O Agni,  
Let us fly to the regions of the pious whither have gone the  
first-born ancient Rishis.  
53 The Drop, the powerful, the falcon, righteous, impetuous  
bird borne on his golden pinions,  
Great, stedfast, settled in the habitation—to thee be reverence!  
Forbear to harm [thee](errata.htm#11.md)!  
54 Centre of earth, heaven's head art thou, essence of waters  
and of plants.  
Eternal, far spread refuge. Homage to the Path!  
55 Attached thou standest at the head of all the world. Thy  
heart is in the sea, thy life is in the floods. Give water:  
cleave the reservoir.

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

Help us with rain sent from the sky, Parjanya, firmament,  
or earth.  
56 By Bhrigus and by Vasus hath prayer-granting sacrifice  
been paid.  
Come, Wealth, into the house of him our dear, our well-beloved  
one.  
57 May Agni, served with sacrifice and gifts, protect our offered  
food:  
This homage be Good-speed to Gods!  
58 That which hath flowed from purpose or from judgment, or  
gathered from the wind or from the vision,  
Follow ye to the region of the pious whither have gone the  
first-born ancient Rishis.  
59 To thee I trust this man. Celestial Dwelling! treasure which  
Jâtavedas shall bring hither.  
After you will the Sacrificer follow. Here recognize him in  
the highest heaven.  
60 Acknowledge him, ye Gods, in highest heaven. Ye who are  
present, know the shape he weareth.  
When he approacheth by the God-ward pathways, reveal to  
him the meed of pious actions.  
61 Wake up, O Agni, etc., as in XV. 54.  
62 Convey our sacrifice to heaven, etc., as in XV. 55,  
63 With Darbha-bunch, with fencing-wood, with spoon, with  
altar, holy grass,  
With [laud](errata.htm#12.md), lead this our sacrifice to go to heaven
among  
the Gods.  
64 Our gifts, our charitable grants, our pious works, our fees to  
priests,  
May the Omnific's Agni set all this among the Gods in heaven.

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

65 There where all never-failing streams of honey and of butter  
flow,  
May Agni, Visvakarman's own, place us in heaven among  
the Gods.  
66 Agni am who know by birth all creatures. Mine eye is  
butter, in my mouth is nectar.  
I am the triple light, the region's meter: exhaustless heat  
am I, named burnt oblation.  
67 Praise-verses, sacrificial texts, and chanted hymns am I in name.  
Thou art the best of all the Fires among the fivefold race  
of man  
That burn upon this earth of ours. Speed thou us on to  
lengthened life.  
68 O Indra, for the strength that slays Vritra and conquers in  
the fight  
We torn thee hitherward to us.  
69 Thou, Indra, much-invoked, didst crush to pieces, Kunâru,  
handless fiend who dwelt with Dânus.  
Thou with might, Indra, smotest dead the scorner, the footless  
Vritra as he waxed in vigour.  
70 O Indra, beat our foes away, etc. as in VIII. 44.  
71 Like some dread wild beast roaming on the mountain thou  
hast approached us from the farthest distance.  
Whetting thy bolt and thy sharp blade, O Indra, crush thou  
the foes and scatter those who hate us.  
72 To aid us let Vaisvânara come from the distance far away:  
Come Agni, to our eulogies!  
73 Sought in the sky, sought on the earth, sought after, all  
plants that grow on ground hath Agni entered.  
May Agni, may Vaisvânara with vigour, sought for, by day  
and night from harm preserve us.

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

74 Help its that we may gain this wish, O Agni, gain riches,  
Wealthy One! with store of heroes.  
Desiring strength from thee may we be strengthened, and  
win, Eternal! thine eternal glory.  
75 Approaching with raised hands and adoration, we have this  
day fulfilled for thee thy longing.  
Worship the Gods with most devoted spirit as Priest with  
no unfriendly thought. O Agni.  
76 Home-hider Agni, Indra, and Brahma, and bright Brihaspati—  
May the All Gods, one-minded, guard our sacrifice in happy  
place.  
77 Guard thou the Sacrificer's men, O Youthfullest, etc., as in  
XIII. 52.
