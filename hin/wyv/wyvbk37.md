For Makha thee, thee for the head of Makha! For Makha  
thee, thee for the head of Makha! For Makha thee, thee  
for the head of Makha!  
11 For Yama thee. For Makha thee. For Sûrya's fervent  
ardour thee.  
May Savitar the God with balm anoint thee. Guard thou  
the touches of the earth.  
Flame art thou; thou art radiance; thou art heat.  
12 Unconquerable, eastward, in Agni's overlordship, give me life.  
Rich in sons, southward, in Indra's overlordship give me  
offspring.  
Fair-seated, westward, in God. Savitar's overlordship, give  
me sight.  
Range of hearing, northward, in Dhâtar's overlordship, give  
me increase of wealth.  
Arrangement, upward, in Brihaspati's overlordship, give me  
energy.  
From all destructive spirits guard us. Thou art Manu's mare.  
13 All-hail! By Maruts be thou compassed round.  
Guard the sky's touches. Mead, mead, mead.  
14 Germ of the Gods, Father of hymns, all living creatures’  
guardian Lord,  
Radiant, with radiant Savitar united, with the Sun he shines.  
15 Agni combined with flaming fire, combined with Savitar  
divine, hath shone together with the Sun.

16 He shines on earth upholder of the sky and heat, the Gods  
upholder, God, immortal, born of heat.  
To him address a speech devoted to the Gods.  
17 I saw the Herdsman, him who never stumbles, approaching  
by his pathways and departing.  
He, clothed with gathered and diffusive splendour, within  
the worlds continually travels.  
18 Lord of all earths, Lord of all mind, Lord of all speech,  
thou Lord of speech entire.  
Heard by the Gods, Caldron divine, do thou, a God, protect  
the Gods.  
Here, after, let it speed you twain on to the banquet of the  
Gods.  
Sweetness for both the sweetness-lovers! Sweetness for  
those the twain who take delight in sweetness!  
19 Thee for the heart, thee for the mind, thee for the sky, for  
Sûrya thee.  
Standing erect lay thou the sacrifice in heaven among the  
Gods.  
20 Thou art our Father, father-like regard us. Obeisance be to  
thee. Do not thou harm us.  
May we, accompanied by Tvashtar, win thee. Vouchsafe me  
sons and cattle. Grant us offspring. Safe may I be together  
with my husband.  
21 May Day together with his sheen, pair-lighted with his light,  
accept. All-hail!  
May Night together with her sheen, fair lighted with her.  
light, accept. All-hail!
