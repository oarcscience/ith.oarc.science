### BOOK THE TWENTY-FIRST.

VARUNA, hear this call of mine: be gracious unto us this  
day.  
Longing for help I yearn for thee.  
2 I ask this of thee with my prayer, etc., as in XVIII. 49.  
3 Do thou who knowest Varuna, O Agni, put far away from  
us the God's displeasure.  
Best Sacrificer, brightest One, refulgent, remove thou far  
from us all those who hate us.  
4 Be thou the nearest unto us, O Agni, our closest Friend  
while now this Morn is breaking.  
Reconcile Varuna to us, be bounteous: show thy compassion  
and be swift to hear us.  
5 We call to succour us the mighty Mother of those whose  
sway is just, the Queen of Order,  
Strong-ruler, far-expanding, ne’er decaying, Aditi gracious  
guide and good protectress.  
6 Sinless may we ascend, for weal, this vessel rowed with  
good oars, divine, that never leaketh,  
Earth our strong guard, incomparable Heaven. Aditi gracious  
guide and good protectress.  
7 May I ascend the goodly ship, free from defect, that leaketh  
not,  
Moved by a hundred oars, for weal.  
8 O Mitra-Varuna, gracious Pair, with fatness dew our  
pasturage,  
With mead the regions of the air.

onwards, they have accepted the cooked viands, they have  
waxed strong with the rice-cakes. The Agnis, Sarasvatî,

this Sacrificer chosen for many collected, saying: This  
(Agni) shall win by sacrifice for me choice-worthy treasures  
among the Gods. O God, what gifts the Gods have  
given, these do thou desire and approve. And thou art  
a commissioned Hotar, a human Hotar sent forward for  
benediction, for good speech, Speak thou good words.
