### BOOK THE NINTH.

OUR sacrifice, God Savitar, speed onward: speed to his share  
the sacrifice's patron.  
May the celestial Gandharva, cleanser of thought and will,  
make clean our thought and purpose: the Lord of Speech  
sweeten the food we offer.  
2 Thee, firmly set, settled in man, in spirit.  
Taken upon a base art thou. I take thee, draught acceptable  
to Indra. This is thy home. Thee, welcomest to Indra.  
Thee Set in waters, butter, realm of ether. Taken upon  
......Indra.  
Thee seated in the sky, earth, air's mid-region, among the  
Gods and in the vault of heaven. Taken, etc. as above:  
3 The strength-arousing essence of the waters, gathered in  
the Sun, Essence of waters’ essence, that, most excellent,  
I take for you.  
Taken, etc., as above.  
4 Cups of strength-giving sacrifice, inspirers of the sage's  
hymn  
Of you, the handleless, have I collected all the sap and  
strength.  
Taken, etc., as above.  
United are ye twain: with bliss unite me. Parted are ye:  
keep me apart from evil.

5 Thou art the thunderbolt of Indra, winner of wealth: with  
thee may this man win him riches.  
In gain of wealth we celebrate with praises her, Aditi by  
name, the Mighty Mother,  
On whom this Universe of life hath settled. Thereon God  
Savitar promote our dwelling!  
6 Amrit is in the Waters, in the Waters healing medicine.  
Yea, Horses! at our praises of the Waters grow ye fleet  
and strong.  
Whatever wave, O ye celestial Waters, wealth-giving,  
towering high, and swiftly rushing, is yours, therewith  
may this man win him riches.  
7 It was the wind, or it was thought, or the Gandharvas  
twenty-seven  
These at the first harnessed the horse: they set the power  
of speed in him.  
8 Steed, being yoked grow wind-swift: be beauteous as Indra's  
right-hand steed.  
Omniscient Maruts harness thee! Tvashtar put swiftness in  
thy feet!  
9 What speed, O Horse, was laid in thee in secret, what  
passed in wind, bestowed upon the falcon,  
With that same strength be strong for us, O Courser,  
wealth-winning and victorious in battle.  
Starting to run your course, winners of riches, smell ye  
Brihaspati's portion, O ye Horses.  
10 By impulse of God Savitar, true Impeller, may ascend  
Brihaspati's highest heaven.

By impulse of God Savitar, true Impeller, may I ascend  
the highest heaven of Indra.  
By impulse of God Savitar, true Impeller, Brihaspati's  
highest heaven have I ascended.  
By impulse of God Savitar, true Impeller, I have ascended  
Indra's loftiest heaven.  
11 Brihaspati, win the prize. Lift up your voices to Brihaspati.  
Make ye Brihaspati win the prize.  
Do thou, O Indra, win the prize. To Indra lift your voices  
up. Make Indra winner of the prize.  
12 True hath been this your league whereby ye made  
Brihaspati win the prize.  
Brihaspati have ye caused to win the prize. Be freed, ye  
Forest-lords.  
Faithful was this your league whereby ye have made Indra  
win the prize.  
Ye have made Indra win the prize. Be ye set free, ye  
Forest-lords.  
13 Through impulse of God Savitar, true Impeller, mine be  
Brihaspati's prize who winneth prizes.  
On to the goal, ye Steeds, winners of prizes, blocking the  
ways and meting out the courses!  
14 Bound by the neck and at the flanks and in the mouth,  
that vigorous Courser lends new swiftness to his sped.

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

Drawing himself together as his strength allows, Dadhikrâs  
speeds along the windings of the paths. All-hail!  
15 His pinion, rapid runner, fans him on his way, as of a bird  
that hastens onward to its aim,  
And, as it were a falcon's gliding through the air, strikes  
Dadhikrâvan's side as he speeds on with might. All-hail!  
16 Bless us the Coursers when we call, while slowly they move,  
strong singers, to the Gods’ assembly.  
Crushing the wolf, the serpent, and the demons, may they  
completely banish all affliction. All-hail!  
17 May all those vigorous Coursers listen to our cry, hearers  
of invocation, speeders on their way;  
Winners of thousands, fain to win where meed is won, who  
gather of themselves great wealth in every race.  
18 Deep-skilled in Law Eternal, wise, immortal, O Coursers,  
help us in each fray for booty.  
Drink of this meath, be satisfied, be joyful: then go on  
paths which Gods are wont to travel.  
19 To me come plenteous growth of wealth! Approach me  
these, Heaven and Earth, who wear each form and figure!  
Hither may Father come to me, and Mother. Soma with  
immortality approach me!  
20 To the Friend, Hail! To the Good Fiend, Hail! To the  
Later-born, Hail! To Resolution, Hail! To the Vasu, Hail!  
To the Lord of Days, Hail! To the Failing Day, Hail!  
To the Failing sprung from the Transitory, Hail! To the  
Transitory sprung from the Final, Hal! To the Final  
Mundane, Hail! To the Lord of the World, Hail! To the  
Sovran Lord, Hail!

21 May life succeed through sacrifice. May life-breath thrive  
by sacrifice. May the eye thrive by sacrifice. May the  
ear thrive by sacrifice. May the back thrive by sacrifice.  
May sacrifice thrive by sacrifice.  
We have become the children of Prajâpati. Gods, we have  
gone to heaven. We have become immortal.  
22 In us be your great might and manly vigour, in us be your  
intelligence and splendour.  
Obeisance to our Mother Earth! Obeisance to our Mother  
Earth!  
This is thy Sovranty. Thou art the ruler, thou art controller,  
thou art firm and stedfast.  
Thee for land-culture, thee for peace and quiet, thee for  
wealth, thee for increase of our substance.  
23 Of old the furtherance of strength urged onward this Sovran  
Soma in the plants and waters.  
For us may they be stored with honey: stationed in front  
may we be watchful in the kingdom. All-hail!  
24 The furtherance of strength extended over this heaven and  
all the worlds as sovran ruler.  
He, knowing, makes the churl a bounteous giver: wealth  
may he grant us with full store of heroes. All-hail  
25 Surely the furtherance of strength pervaded all these  
existing worlds in all directions.  
From olden time the King moves round, well knowing,  
strengthening all the people and our welfare.  
26 As suppliants, for aid we grasp Soma the King, and Agni, the  
Âdityas, Vishnu, Sûrya, and the Brahman-priest Brihaspati.
