### BOOK THE TWENTY-SECOND.

SPLENDOUR art thou, bright, deathless, life-protector.  
Protector of my life be thou.  
By impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,  
with the hands of Pûshan.  
2 This girdle, which in their religious meetings sages assumed  
in earlier time of worship,  
Is present with us here at this libation, in the Law's hymn,  
proclaiming rich abundance.  
3 Famous art thou, thou art the world, controller and  
upholder thou.  
Go, consecrate by Svâhâ to Agni Vaisvânara widely-famed.  
4 For Gods and for Prajâpati I fit thee. For Gods and for  
Prajâpati, O Brahman,  
Will I tie up the horse. Thence may I prosper! Binding  
him for Prajâpati and Gods be thou successful.  
5 Thee welcome to Prajâpati I sprinkle. I sprinkle thee  
welcome to Indra-Agni. I sprinkle thee acceptable to Vâyu.  
Thee welcome to the All-Gods I besprinkle. Thee  
welcome to all Deities I sprinkle.  
With fury Varuna attacks the man who fain would slay the  
steed.  
Avaunt the man! Avaunt the dog!

9 May we attain that excellent glory of Savitar the God:  
So may he stimulate our prayers.  
10 For our protection I invoke the golden-handed Savitar:  
He knoweth, as a God, the place.  
11 We specially invoke the grace of Savitar, observant God,  
The great good-will that gives true boons.  
12 We seek the eulogy and gift of Savitar who strengthens grace,  
Yea, of the God who knows our thoughts.  
13 I invocate the heroes’ Lord, free-giving Savitar, and call  
The Cheerer to the feast of Gods.

14 The judgment of bright Savitar, that cheers the All-Gods’  
company,  
With prayer we estimate as bliss.  
15 Wake Agni with thy laud and set the Immortal One aflame,  
let him  
Bestow our offerings on the Gods.  
16 Oblation-bearer, well-inclined, immortal, eager Messenger,  
Agni comes near us with the thought.  
17 Agni, Envoy, I place in front, the oblation-bearer I address:  
Here let him seat the Deities.  
18 Yea, Pavamâna, thou didst generate the Sun and spread  
the moisture out with power,  
Basting to us with plenty vivified with milk.  
19 Mighty through thy dam, eminent through thy sire, thou  
art a horse, thou art a steed, thou art a courser, thou  
art a comfort, thou art a racer, thou art a yoke-horse,  
thou art a strong steed, thou art a stallion, thou art  
manly-minded. Thou art called Yayu, thou art called  
Sisu. Follow thou the flight of the Âdityas.  
Gods, Warders of the Regions, protect for the Gods this  
horse besprinkled for sacrifice.  
Here is delight. Here take thy pleasure. Here is content.  
Here is self-content.
