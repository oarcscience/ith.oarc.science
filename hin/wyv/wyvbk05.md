### BOOK THE FIFTH

BODY of Agni art thou. Thee for Vishnu. Body of Soma art  
thou. Thee for Vishnu. Thou art the Guest's Reception.  
Thee for Vishnu. Thee for the Soma-bringing Falcon.  
Thee for Vishnu. Thee for the giver of abundance, Agni.  
Thee for Vishnu.  
2 Birth-place art thou of Agni. Ye are sprinklers. Thou art  
Urvasi. Thou art Âyu. Thou art Purûravas.  
I rub and churn thee with Gâyatrî metre. I rub and churn  
thee with the Trishtup metre. I rub and churn thee with,  
the Jagatî metre.  
3 Be ye for us one-minded, be one-thoughted, free from spot  
and stain.  
Harm not the sacrifice, harm not the sacrifice's lord. Be  
kind to us this day, Omniscient Ones!  
4 Preserver from the curse, Son of the Rishis, Agni is active  
having entered Agni.  
Here for us kindly with fair worship offer oblation to the  
Gods with care unceasing. Svâhâ!  
5 For him who flies around and rushes onward I take thee,  
for Tanûnapât the mighty, the very strong, of all-surpassing  
vigour.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

Strength of the Gods, inviolate, inviolable still art thou, the  
strength that turns the curse away, uncursed and never  
to be cursed.  
May I go straight to truth. Place me in comfort.  
6 O Agni, Guardian of the Vow, O Guardian of the Vow, in  
thee  
Whatever form there is of thine, may that same form be  
here on me: un thee be every form of mine.  
O Lord of Vows, let our vows be united. May Dîkshâ's  
Lord allow my Consecration, may holy Fervour's Lord  
approve my Fervour.  
7 May every stalk of thine wax full and strengthen for Indra  
Ekadhanavid, God Soma!  
May Indra grow in strength for thee: for Indra mayest thou  
grow strong.  
Increase us friends with strength and mental vigour. May  
all prosperity be thine, God Soma. May I attain the  
solemn Soma-pressing.  
May longed-for wealth come forth for strength and fortune.  
Let there be truth for those whose speech is truthful. To  
Heaven and Earth be adoration offered.  
8 That noblest body which is thine, O Agni, laid in the lowest  
deep, encased in iron, hath chased the awful word, the  
word of terror. Svâhâ!  
That noblest . . . . . . encased in silver, etc. Svâhâ  
That noblest . . . . with gold around it, etc. Svâhâ!

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

9 For me thou art the home of the afflicted. For me thou art  
the gathering-place of riches. Protect me from the, woe  
of destitution.  
Protect me from the state of perturbation.  
May Agni know thee, he whose name is Nabhas. Go, Agni,  
Angiras, with the name of Âyu.  
Thou whom this earth containeth, down I lay thee with each  
inviolate holy name thou bearest.  
Thou whom the second earth, etc. Thou whom the third  
earth, etc.  
Thee, further, for the Gods’ delight.  
10 A foe-subduing lioness art thou: be fitted for the Gods.  
A foe-subduing lioness art thou: be purified for Gods.  
A foe-subduing lioness art thou: adorn thyself for Gods.  
11 Indra's shout guard thee in the front with Vasus. The Wise  
One guard thee from the rear with Rudras. The Thought-swift  
guard thee on the right with Fathers. The Omnific  
guard thee, leftward, with Âdityas.  
This heated water I eject and banish from the sacrifice.  
12 Thou art a lioness. All-hail! Thou art a lioness winning  
Âdityas. All-hail!  
Thou art a lioness winning Brâhmans and Nobles. All-hail!  
Thou art a lioness that wins fair offspring, win abundant  
wealth. All-hail!  
A lioness art thou. Bring the Gods hither for him who  
offers sacrifice. All-hail!  
To living creatures; thee.

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

13 Firm art thou, steady thou the earth. Firm-seated art thou,  
steady thou the air.  
Movelessly set art thou, steady the sky. Agni's completion  
art thou.  
14 The priests of him the lofty Priest well-skilled in hymns  
harness their spirits, yea harness their holy thoughts.  
He only knowing works assigns their priestly tasks. Yea,  
lofty is the praise of Savitar the God. All-hail!  
15 Forth through This All strode Vishnu: thrice his foot he  
planted, and the whole was gathered in his footstep's dust.  
All-hail!  
16 Rich in sweet food be ye, and rich in milch-kine, with fertile  
pastures, fair to do men service.  
Both these worlds, Vishnu, hast thou stayed asunder, and  
firmly fixed the earth with pegs around it.  
17 Heard by the Gods, ye twain, to Gods proclaim it.  
Go eastward, O ye twain, proclaiming worship. Swerve ye  
not: bear the sacrifice straight upward.  
To your own cow-pen speak, ye godlike dwellings.  
Speak not away my life, speak not away my children.  
On the earth's summit here may ye be joyful.

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

18 Now will I tell the mighty deeds of Vishnu, of him who  
measured out the earthly regions.  
Who propped the highest place of congregation, thrice setting  
down his foot and widely striding.  
For Vishnu thee.  
19 Either from heaven or from the earth, O Vishnu, or, Vishnu,  
from the vast wide air's mid-region,  
Fill both thy hands full with abundant riches, and from the  
right and from the left bestow them.  
For Vishnu thee.  
20 For this his mighty deed is Vishnu lauded, like some wild  
beast, dread, prowling, mountain-roaming,  
He within whose three wide-extended paces all living creatures  
have their habitation,  
21 Thou art the frontlet for the brow of Vishnu. Ye are the  
corners of the mouth of Vishnu. Thou art the needle  
for the work of Vishnu. Thou art the firmly-fastened knot  
of Vishnu. To Vishnu thou belongest. Thee for Vishnu.  
22 By impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins  
and with hands of Pûshan.  
Thou art a woman. Here I cut the necks of Râkshasas away.  
Mighty art thou, mighty the sound thou makest. Utter thy  
mighty-sounding voice to Indra:  
23 Fiend-killing, charm-destroying voice of Vishnu.  
Here I cast out that charm of magic power which stranger  
or housemate for me hath buried.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

Here I cast out the charm of magic power buried for me  
by equal or unequal.  
Here I cast out the charm that hath been buried for me by  
non-relation or relation.  
I cast the charm of magic out.  
24 Self-ruler art thou, conquering foes. Ruler for ever art  
thou, killing enemies.  
Men's ruler art thou, slaying fiends. All ruler, killing foes,  
art thou.  
25 I sprinkle you whom Vishnu owns, killers of fiends and evil  
charms.  
I buy down you whom Vishnu loves, killers of fiends and  
wicked charms.  
I scatter you whom Vishnu loves, killers of fiends and  
wicked charms.  
You two whom Vishnu loves, who kill fiends and ill charms  
do I lay down.  
You two whom Vishnu loves, who kill fiends and ill charms  
I compass round.  
To Vishnu thou belongest. Ye are Vishnu's.  
26 By impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,  
with the hands of Peahen.  
Thou art a woman. Here I cut the necks of Râkshasas away.  
Barley art thou. Bar off from us our haters, bar our enemies.  
Thee for heaven, thee for earth, thee for air's region.  
Pure be the worlds, the Fathers’ dwelling-places. Thou art  
the habitation of the Fathers.

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

27 Prop heaven, fill full the air, on earth stand firmly. Dyutâna,  
offspring of the Maruts, plant thee!, Mitra and Varuna  
with firm upholding.  
I close thee in, thou winner of the Brahmans, winner of  
Nobles and abundant riches.  
Strengthen the Brahmans, strengthen thou the Nobler,  
strengthen our vital power, strengthen our offspring.  
28 Firm-set art thou. Firm be this Sacrificer within this home  
with offspring and with cattle.  
O Heaven and Earth, be ye filled full of fatness.  
Indra's mat art thou, shelter of all people.  
29 Lover of song, may these our songs encompass thee on every  
side;  
Strengthening thee of lengthened life, may they be dear  
delights to thee  
30 Thou art the needle for the work of Indra. Thou art the  
firmly fastened knot of Indra. Indra's art thou. Thou art  
the Visvedevas’.  
31 All-present art thou, carrying off. Oblation-bearing priest  
art thou.  
Thou art the Swift, the Very Wise. Tutha art thou, who  
knoweth all.  
32 Thou art the yearning one, the sage. Angnâri, Bambhâri  
art thou.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

Aid-seeker art thou, worshipping. Cleanser art thou, the  
cleansing-place. Krisânu, Sovran Lord, art thou.  
Thou art the Pavamâna of the assembly. Thou art the  
welkin ever moving forward. Swept clean art thou, preparer  
of oblations. Thou art the seat of Law, heaven's light  
and lustre.  
33 A sea art thou of all-embracing compass. Aja art thou, who  
hath one foot to bear him. Thou art the Dragon of the  
Depths of ocean. Speech art thou, thou the Sadas, thou  
art Indra's. Doors of the sacrifice, do not distress me!  
Lord, Ruler of the pathways, lead me onward. In this God-reaching  
path may I be happy.  
34 Look ye upon me with the eye of Mitra.  
O Agnis, ye, receivers of oblations, are by a lauded name  
lauded together. Protect me, Agnis! with your glittering  
army. Fill me with riches, Agnis! be my keepers. To  
you be adoration. Do not harm me.  
35 Thou art a light that wears all forms and figures, serving  
the general host of Gods as Kindler.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

Thou, Soma, wilt withhold thy wide protection from body-wounding  
hatreds shown by others. All-hail!  
Let the Swift graciously enjoy the butter. All-hail!  
36 By goodly paths lead us to riches, Agni, thou God who  
knowest every sacred duty.  
Remove the sin that makes us stray and wander: most  
ample adoration will we bring thee.  
37 Wide room and comfort may this Agni give us, and go before  
us cleaving down our foemen.  
May he win booty in the fight for booty: May he quell foes  
in his triumphant onset.  
38 O Vishnu, stride thou widely forth, give ample room for our  
abode.  
Drink butter, homed in butter! Still speed on the sacrifice's  
lord. All-hail!  
39 To thee, God Savitar, belongs this Soma. Guard him securely:  
let not demons harm thee.  
Now hast thou joined the Gods as God, God Soma: men  
have I joined here through abundant riches.  
All-hail! from Varuna's noose am I delivered.  
40 O Agni, Guardian of the Vow, O Guardian of the Vow, on  
me whatever form of thine path been, may that same  
form be upon thee. Whatever form of mine hath been on  
thee, may that he here on me.  
O Lord of Vows, our vows have been accomplished. Dîkshâ's  
Lord hath approved my Consecration, and holy Fervour's  
Lord allowed my Fervour.  
41 O Vishnu, stride thou widely forth, make ample room for  
our abode.  
Drink butter, homed in butter! Still speed on the sacrifice's  
lord. All Hail!

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

42 I have passed others, not approached to others. On the near  
side of those that were more distant, and farther than  
the nearer have I found thee.  
So, for the worship of the Gods, with gladness we welcome  
thee God, Sovran of the Forest! Let the Gods welcome  
thee for the Gods’ service. For Vishnu thee. Plant, guard!!  
Axe, do not harm it!  
43 Graze not the sky. Harm not mid-air. Be in accordance with  
the earth.  
For this well-sharpened axe hath led thee forth to great  
felicity.  
Hence, with a hundred branches, God, Lord of the Forest,  
grow thou up.  
May we grow spreading with a hundred branches.
