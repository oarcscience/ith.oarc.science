THE Gods drew waters with their store of sweetness, succulent  
and observant, king-creating,  
Wherewith they sprinkled Varuna and Mitra, wherewith  
they guided Indra past his foemen.

Thou, friend of speech, heat-born, art undefeated. Soma's  
share art thou. Hail, ye king producers!

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

7 Sharers in joy are these majestic Waters, inviolate, industrious,  
investing.  
In these as homes hath Varuna made his dwelling, he, Child  
of Waters, in the best of mothers.  
8 Thou art the inner caul of princely power, Thou art the  
outer caul of princely power. Of princely power thou art  
the womb, the navel.  
Thou art the Vritra-slaying arm of Indra. Mitra's art thou,  
thou Varuna's possession. With thee to aid may this man  
slaughter Vritra.  
Cleaver art thou; thou Render; thou art Shaker. Protect  
him ye in front, protect him rearwards; protect him sidewards;  
from all quarters guard him.  
9 Visible, O ye men, Informed is Agni, Master of the House.  
hold. Informed is Indra of exalted glory. Informed are  
Mitra-Varuna, Law-Maintainers. Informed is Pûshan, Lord  
of all Possessions. Informed are Heaven and Earth, the  
All-propitious. Informed is Aditi who gives wide shelter.  
10 Appeased by sacrifice are biting creatures, Ascend the East.  
May Gâyatrî protect thee, the psalm Rathantara, the  
triple praise-song, the season Spring, and the rich treasure,  
Priesthood.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

11 Ascend the South. Be thy protectors Trishtup, the Brihat  
Sâman, the fifteenfold praise-song, the Reason Summer,  
and the treasure Kingship.  
12 Ascend the West. May Jagatî protect thee, the psalm Vairûpa,  
the seventeenfold praise-song, the Rain-time, and  
that store of wealth, the People.  
13 Ascend the North. Thy guardians be Anushtup, Vairâja  
psalm, the twenty-onefold praise-song, the season  
Autumn, that rich treasure Fruitage.  
14 Ascend the Zenith. Pankti be thy keeper, Sâkvara, Raivata  
the pair of Sâmans,  
Praise-songs the thirty-threefold and thrice-ninefold, both  
seasons, Winter, Dews, that treasure lustre.  
The head of Namuchi hath been cast from me.  
15 Brilliance of Soma art thou, may my brilliance grow like thine.  
Save me from death. Vigour art thou, victory, everlasting life.  
16 With golden bodies, at the flush of morning, ye rise on  
high, two Sovran Lords, and Sûrya.  
Ascend your car, O Varuna and Mitra: thence view infinity  
and limitation.  
Thou art Mitra, thou art Varuna.  
17 Thee with the strength of Soma, Agni's lustre, with Sûrya's  
splendour, Indra's might I sprinkle.  
Be Lord of princes: safe past arrows guard him.

18 = IX. 40.  
19 Forth from the summit of the bull, the mountain, pouring  
spontaneously, the ships keep moving.  
They, lifted up, have turned them back and downward, still  
flowing onward, after Ahibudhnya.  
Thou art the stepping-forth of Vishnu: thou art Vishnu's  
outstep; Vishnu's step art thou.  
20 Prajâpati, thou only comprehendest all these created forms,  
and none beside thee.  
Give us our heart's desire when we invoke thee. So-and-So's  
father is this man. Sire of this man is So-and-So.  
May we—All-hail!—be lords of rich possessions.  
What active highest name thou hast, O Rudra, therein thou  
art an offering, art an offering at home. All-hail!  
21 Indra's bolt art thou. I by the direction of Mitra-Varuna,  
Directors, yoke thee.  
I, the uninjured Arjuna, mount thee for firmness, thee for food.  
By quickening of the Maruts be thou victor. May we obtain  
by mind: with power united.  
22 Let us not, Indra, conqueror of the mighty, unfit through  
lack of prayer fail to obtain thee.  
Ascend the car which thou whose hand bears thunder  
controllest, and the reins with noble horses.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

23 All hail to Agni, Master of the Household! All-hail to Soma,  
Sovran of the Forest!  
All-hail to the great vigour of the Maruts! All-hail to the  
effectual might of Indra!  
Injure me not, O Mother Earth, and may I never injure thee.  
24 The Hamsa throned in light, the Vasu in mid-air, the  
Priest beside the altar, Guest within the house,  
Dwelling in noblest place, mid men, in truth, in sky, born  
of flood, kine, truth, mountain, be is mighty Law.  
25 So great art thou: life art thou; give me life,  
Mate art thou: thou art splendour; give me splendour.  
Strength art thou: give me strength. I draw you downward,  
two arms of Indra mighty in achievement.  
26 Fair art thou, good to sit on, womb of kingship.  
Sit on the fair one, sit on that which offers a pleasant seat:  
sit in the womb of kingship.  
27 Varuna, Law's maintainer, hath sat down among his people, he  
Most wise, for universal sway.  
28 Supreme Lord art thou. May these five regions of thine be  
prosperous. Brahman! Thou art Brahman, Savitar art  
thou, faithful in impulsion, Varuna art thou, he whose  
power is real. Indra art thou, whose strength is of the  
people. Rudra art thou, the very kind and gracious.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

Doer of much, Improver, Wealth-increaser!  
Indra's holt art thou. Be therewith my vassal.  
29 May spacious Agni, Lord of Duty, gladly, vast Agni, Duty's  
Lord, accept the butter. All-hail!  
Hallowed by Svâhâ, with the beams of Sûrya, strive for his  
central place among the kinsmen.  
30 I creep forth urged onward by Savitar the Impeller; by  
Sarasvatî, Speech; by Tvashtar, created forms; by Pûshan,  
cattle; by this Indra; by Brihaspati, Devotion; by  
Varuna, Power; by Agni, Brilliance; by Soma, the King;  
by Vishnu the tenth Deity.  
31 Get dressed for the Asvins. Get dressed for Sarasvatî:  
Get dressed for Indra the Good Deliverer:  
Soma the Wind, purified by the strainer, Indra's meet  
friend, hath gone o’erflowing backward.  
32 What then? As men whose fields are full of barley reap  
the ripe corn, removing it in order,  
So bring the food of these men, bring it hither, who pay  
the Sacred Grass their spoken homage.  
Taken upon a base art thou. Thee for the Asvins.  
Thee for Sarasvatî, and thee for Indra, for the Excellent  
Protector.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

33 Ye Asvins, Lords of Splendour, drank full draughts of  
grateful Soma juice,  
And aided Indra in his deeds with Namuchi of Asura birth.  
34 As parents aid a son, both Asvins aided thee, Indra, with  
their wondrous powers and wisdom.  
When thou with might hadst drunk the draught that  
gladdens, Sarasvatî, O Bounteous Lord, refreshed thee.
