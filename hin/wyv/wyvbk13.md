### BOOK THE THIRTEENTH

I TAKE within me Agni first, for increase of my wealth,  
good offspring, manly strength:  
So may the Deities wait on me.  
2 Thou art the waters’ back, the womb of Agni, around the  
ocean as it swells and surges.  
Waxing to greatness, resting on the lotus, spread forth in  
amplitude with heaven's own measure.  
3 Eastward at first was Brahma generated. Vena o’erspread  
the bright Ones from the summit,  
Disclosed his deepest nearest revelations, womb of existent  
and of non-existent.  
4 In the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, born Only Lord of all  
created being.  
He fixed and holdeth up this earth and heaven. Worship  
we Ka the God with our oblation.  
5 The Drop leaped onward through the earth and heaven,  
along this place and that which was before it.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

I offer up, throughout the seven oblations, the Drop still  
moving to the common dwelling.  
6 Homage be paid to Serpents unto all of them that are on  
earth,  
To those that dwell in air, to those that dwell in sky be  
homage paid.  
7 To those that are the demons’ darts, to those that live upon  
the trees,  
To all the Serpents that lie low in holes be adoration paid.  
8 Or those that are in heaven's bright sphere, or those that  
dwell in the Sun's beams:  
Serpents, whose home has been prepared in waters, homage  
unto them!  
9 Put forth like a wide-spreading net thy vigour: go like a  
mighty King with his attendants.  
Thou, following thy swift net, shootest arrows: transfix the  
fiends with darts that burn most fiercely.  
10 Forth go in rapid flight thy whirling weapons: follow them  
closely glowing in thy fury.  
Spread with thy tongue the wingèd flames, O Agni: unfettered  
cast thy firebrands all around thee.  
11 Send thy spies forward, fleetest in thy motion: be, ne’er  
deceived, the guardian of this people  
From him who, near or far, is bent on evil, and let no  
trouble sent from thee o’ercome us.  
12 Rise up, O Agni, spread thee out before us, burn down our  
foes, thou who hast sharpened arrows.  
Him, blazing Agni! who hath worked us mischief, consume  
thou utterly like dried-up stubble.  
13 Rise, Agni, drive off those who fight against us: make  
manifest thine own celestial vigour.  
Slacken the strong bows of the demon-driven: destroy our  
foemen whether kin or stranger.  
I settle thee with Agni's fiery ardour.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

14 Agni is head and height of heaven, the Master of the earth  
is he:  
He quickeneth the waters’ seed.  
I settle thee with the great strength of Indra.  
15 Thou art the leader of the rite and region to which with  
thine auspicious teams thou tendest.  
Thy light-bestowing head to heaven thou liftest, making  
thy tongue the oblation-bearer, Agni!  
16 Steady art thou, sustainer, laid by Visvakarman in thy  
place.  
Let not the ocean nor the bird harm thee: unshaking, steady  
earth.  
17 Thee let Prajâpati settle on the waters’ back, in Ocean's  
course,  
Thee the capacious, widely spread. Thou art the Wide  
One: spread thee wide  
18 Thou art the earth, the ground, thou art the all-sustaining  
Aditi, she who supporteth all the world.  
Control the earth, steady the earth, do thou the earth no  
injury.  
19 For all breath, out-breath; through-breath, upward-breathing,  
for high position, for prescribed observance,  
May Agni keep thee safe with great well-being, with the  
securest shelter. As aforetime with Angiras, with that  
Deity lie steady.  
20 Upspringing from thine every joint, upspringing from each  
knot of thine,

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

Thus with a thousand, Dûrvâ! with a hundred do thou  
stretch us out.  
21 Thou spreading with a hundred, thou that branched with  
a thousand shoots,  
Thee, such, with our oblation will we worship, O celestial  
Brick.  
22 Thy lights, O Agni, in the Sun that with their beams  
o’erspread the sky,—  
With all of those assist thou us to-day to light and progeny.  
23. Lights of yours in the Sun, O Gods, or lights that are in  
kine and steeds,  
O Indra-Agni, with all those vouchsafe us light, Brihaspati!  
24 The Far.-Refulgent held the light. The Self-Refulgent held  
the light.  
Thee, luminous, may Prajâpati settle upon the back of Earth.  
Give, to all breathing, all the light, to out-breath, to diffusive  
breath.  
Thy Sovran Lord is Agni. With that Deity, as with Angiras,  
lie firmly settled in thy place.  
25 Madhu and Mâdhava, the two Spring seasons—thou art  
the innermost cement of Agni.  
May Heaven and Earth, may Waters, Plants and Agnis  
help, separate, accordant, my precedence.  
May all the Fires ’twixt heaven and earth, one-minded,  
well-fitted, gather round these two Spring seasons,  
As the Gods gathering encompass Indra: firm with that  
Deity, Angiras-like, be seated.  
26 Thou art Ashâdhâ, Conquering One. Conquer our foemen,  
conquer thou the men who fain would-fight with us.  
A thousand manly powers hast thou: so do thou aid and  
quicken me.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

27 The winds waft sweets, the rivers pour sweets for the man  
who keeps the Law:  
So may the plants be sweet for us.  
28 Sweet be the night and sweet the dawns, sweet the terrestrial  
atmosphere:  
Sweet be our Father Heaven to us.  
29 May the tall tree be full of sweets for us and, and full of  
sweets the Sun:  
May our milch-kine be sweet for us.  
30 Seat thyself in the deepness of the waters, lest Sûrya, lest  
Vaisvânara Agni scorch thee.  
With wing unclipped, survey created beings: may rain  
that cometh down from heaven attend thee.  
31 He crept across the three heaven-reaching oceans, the Bull  
of Bricks, the Master of the Waters.  
Clad in the world with his, the Well-Made's, vesture, go  
whither those before thee have departed.  
32 May Heaven and Earth, the Mighty Pair, besprinkle this our  
sacrifice,  
And feed us full with nourishments.  
33 Look ye on Vishnu's works whereby the Friend of Indra,  
close allied,  
Hath let his holy ways be seen.

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

34 Firm art thou, a sustainer. Hence engendered, forth from  
these wombs at first came Jâtavedas.  
By Gâyatrî, by Trishtup, by Anushtup, may he who knows  
bear to the Gods oblation.  
35 Take thou thine ease for food, for store of riches, for might  
in splendour, and for strength and offspring.  
Thou art all-ruling, independent Ruler: both fountains of  
Sarasvatî protect thee!  
36 O radiant Agni, harness thou thy steeds which are most excellent!  
They bear thee as thy spirit wills.  
37 Yoke, Agni, as a charioteer, thy steeds who best invoke the  
Gods:  
As ancient Hotar take thy seat.  
38 Like rivers our libations flow together, cleansing themselves  
in inmost heart and spirit.  
I look upon the flowing streams of butter: the golden reed  
is in the midst of Agni.  
39 Thee for the praise-verse, thee for sheen, thee for bright  
splendour, thee for light.  
This hath become the energetic spirit of all the world and of  
Vaisvânara Agni.  
40 Agni, all-luminous with light, splendid with splendour, golden  
One.  
Giver of thousands art thou: for a thousand thee.

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

41 Balm thou with milk the unborn babe Âditya, wearing all  
forms, creator of a thousand.  
Spare, him with heat, nor plot against him: give him a  
hundred years of life while thou art building.  
42 The wind's impetuous rush, Varuna's navel! the horse that  
springs to life amid the waters!  
The rivers’ tawny child, based on the mountain, harm not,  
O Agni, in the loftiest region.  
43 Unwasting Drop, red, eager, pressing forward, Agni I worship  
with repeated homage.  
Forming thyself with joints in proper order, harm not the  
Cow, Aditi widely ruling!  
44 Her who is Tvashtar's guardian, Varuna's navel, the Ewe  
brought forth from out the loftiest region,  
The Asura's mighty thousandfold contrivance, injure not in  
the highest sphere, O Agni.  
45 The Agni who from Agni had his being, from heat of Earth  
or also heat of Heaven,  
Whereby the Omnific One engendered creatures, him may  
thy fierce displeasure spare, O Agni.  
46 The brilliant presence of the Gods hath risen, the eye of  
Mitra, Varuna, and Agni.  
The soul of all that moveth not or moveth, the Sun hath  
filled the air, and earth and heaven.  
47 Injure not, thousand-eyed, while thou art building for sacrifice,  
this animal, the biped.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

Accept as pith man's counterfeit the victim, Agni: therewith  
building thy forms, be settled.  
Let thy flame reach man's counterfeit: let thy flame reach  
the man we hate.  
48 Harm not this animal whose hooves are solid, the courser  
neighing in the midst of coursers.  
I dedicate to thee the forest Gaura: building thy bodies up  
with him be settled.  
Let thy flame reach the Gaura, let thy flame reach him whom  
we detest.  
49 Thousandfold, with a hundred streams, this fountain,  
expanded in the middle of the waters,  
Infinite, yielding butter for the people, harm not, O Agni,  
in the highest region.  
This wild bull of the forest I assign thee: building thy  
bodies up therewith be settled.  
Let thy flame reach the wild hull, etc. (as in 48).  
50 This creature clothed in wool, Varuna's navel, the skin of  
animals quadruped and biped,  
The first that was produced of Tvashtar's creatures, O Agni,  
harm not in the highest region.  
The forest buffalo do I assign thee: building, etc., as above  
*mutato mutando*.  
51 From Agni's warmth the he-goat had his being: he looked  
at first upon his generator.  
Thereby the Gods at first attained to Godhead: those meet  
for worship to the height ascended.  
The forest Sarabha do I assign thee: building, etc.  
52 Do thou, Most Youthful God, protect the men who offer,  
hear their songs,  
Protect his offspring and himself.

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>
