### BOOK THE THIRTIETH.

OUR sacrifice, God Savitar! speed onward: speed to his share  
the sacrifice's patron.  
May the Celestial Gandharva, cleanser of thought and will,  
make clean our thoughts and wishes.  
The Lord of Speech sweeten the words we utter!  
2 May we attain that excellent glory of Savitar the God:  
So may he stimulate our prayers.  
3 Savitar, God, send far away all troubles and calamities,  
And send us only what is good.  
4 We call on him distributer of wondrous bounty and of wealth,  
On Savitar who looks on men.

tall, one too short, one too stout, one too thin, one too
