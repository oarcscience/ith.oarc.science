### BOOK THE THIRTY-FIRST.

PURUSHA hath a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a  
thousand feet.  
Pervading earth on every side he fills a space ten fingers  
broad.  
2 Purusha is in truth this All, what hath been and what yet  
shall be;  
Lord, too, of immortality which waxes greater still by food.  
3 So mighty in his grandeur; yea, greater than this is Purusha.  
All creatures are one fourth of him, three fourths eternal  
life in heaven.

4 With three fourths Purusha rose up: one fourth of him  
again was here.  
Thence he moved forth to every side over what eats not  
and what eats.  
5 From him Virâj was born; again Purusha from Virâj was  
born.  
When born, he spread to west and east beyond the boundaries  
of earth.  
6 From that great General Sacrifice the dripping fat was  
gathered up.  
He formed the creatures of the air and animals both wild  
and tame.  
7 From that great General Sacrifice Richas and Sâma hymns  
were born:  
Therefrom were spells and charms produced; the Yajus  
had its birth from it.  
8 From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two rows  
of teeth  
From it were generated kine, from it were goats and sheep  
produced.  
9 They balmed as victim on the grass Purusha born in earliest  
time.  
With him the Deities and all Sâdhyas and Rishis sacrificed.  
10 When they divided Purusha how many portions did they  
make?

What was his mouth? what were his arms? what are the  
names of thighs and feet?  
11 The Brâhman was his mouth, of both his arms was the  
Râjanya made.  
His thighs became the Vaisya, from his feet the Sûdra was  
produced.  
12 The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye  
the Sun had birth;  
Vâyu and Prâna from his ear, and from his mouth was Agni  
born.  
13 Forth from his navel came mid-air; the sky was fashioned  
from his head;  
Earth from his feet, and from his ear the Quarters. Thus  
they formed the worlds.  
14 When Gods performed the sacrifice with Purusha as offering  
Spring was the butter, Autumn the oblation, Summer was  
the wood.  
15 Then seven were his enclosing-sticks, his kindling-brands  
were three times seven,  
When Gods, performing sacrifice, bound as their victim  
Purusha.  
16 Gods, sacrificing, sacrificed the victim: these were the earliest  
holy ordinances.  
The Mighty Ones attained the height of heaven, there where  
the Sâdhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.

17 In the beginning he was formed, collected from waters, earth,  
and Visvakarman's essence.  
Fixing the form thereof Tvashtar proceedeth. This was at  
first the mortal's birth and godhead.  
18 I know this mighty Purusha whose colour is like the Sun,  
beyond the reach of darkness.  
He only who knows him leaves Death behind him. There is  
no path save this alone to travel.  
19 In the womb moves Prajâpati: he, never becoming born, is  
born in sundry figures.  
The wise discern the womb from which he springeth. In  
him alone stand all existing creatures.  
20 He who gives light and heat to Gods, first, foremost Agent  
of the Gods,  
Born ere the Gods—to him the bright, the holy One, be  
reverence  
21 Thus spake the Gods at first, as they begat the bright and  
holy One:  
The Brahman who may know thee thus shall have the Gods  
in his control.  
22 Beauty and Fortune are thy wives: each side of thee are  
Day and Night.  
The constellations are thy form: the Asvins are thine open  
jaws.  
Wishing, wish yonder world for me, wish that the Universe  
be mine.
