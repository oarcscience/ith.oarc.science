XXIII. 1.  
11 Who by his grandeur, etc., as in XXIII. 3.  
12 Whose, by his might, are these snow-covered mountains,  
and men call sea and Rasâ his possession:  
Whose are these arms, whose are these heavenly regions.  
What God shall we adore with our oblation?  
13 Giver of vital breath, of power and vigour, he whose  
commandment all the Gods acknowledge:  
The Lord of death, whose shade is life immortal. What  
God shall we adore with our oblation?  
14 May powers auspicious come to us from every side, never  
deceived, unhindered and victorious,  
That the Gods ever may be with us for our gain, our guardians  
day by day, unceasing in their care.  
15 May the auspicious favour of the Gods be ours, on us  
descend the bounty of the righteous Gods.  
The friendship of the Gods have we devoutly sought: so  
may the Gods extend our life that we may live.

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

16 We call them hither with a hymn of olden time, Bhaga, the  
friendly Daksha, Mitra, Aditi,  
Aryaman, Varuna, Soma, the Asvins. May Sarasvatî, auspicious,  
grant felicity.  
17 May the Wind waft to us that pleasant medicine, may Earth  
our Mother give it, and our Father Heaven,  
And the joy-giving stones that press the Soma's juice. Asvins,  
may ye, for whom our spirits long, hear this.  
18 Him we invoke for aid who reigns supreme, the Lord of all  
that stands or moves, inspirer of the soul,  
That Pûshan may promote the increase of our wealth, our  
keeper and our guard infallible for our good.  
19 Illustrious far and wide, may Indra prosper us: may Pûshan  
prosper us, the Master of all wealth.  
May Târkshya with uninjured fellies prosper us: Brihaspati  
vouchsafe to us prosperity.  
20 The Maruts, Sons of Prisni, borne by spotted steeds, moving  
in glory, oft visiting holy rites,  
Sages whose tongue is Agni and their eyes the Sun,——hither  
let all the Gods for our protection come.  
21 Gods, may we with our ears listen to what is good, and with  
our eyes see what is good, ye Holy Ones.  
With limbs and bodies firm may we extolling you attain the  
term of life appointed by the Gods.  
22 A hundred autumns stand before us, O ye Gods, within  
whose space ye bring our bodies to decay;  
Within whose space our sons become fathers in turn. Break  
ye not in the midst our course of fleeting life.  
23 Aditi is the heaven, Aditi is mid-air, Aditi is the Mother  
and the Sire and Son.

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

Aditi is all Gods, Aditi five-classed men, Aditi all that hath  
been born and shall be born.  
24 Slight us not Varuna, Aryaman, or Mitra, Ribhukshan,  
Indra, Âyu, or the Maruts,  
When we declare amid the congregation the virtues of the  
Strong Steed, God-descended.  
25 What time they bear before the Courser, covered with  
trappings and with wealth, the grasped oblation,  
The dappled goat goeth straightforward, bleating, to the  
place dear to Indra and to Pûshan.  
26 Dear to all Gods, this goat, the share of Pûshan, is first led  
forward with the vigorous Courser,  
While Tvashtar sends him forward with the Charger, acceptable  
for sacrifice, to glory.  
27 When thrice the men lead round the Steed, in order, who  
goeth to the Gods as meet oblation,  
The goat precedeth him, the share of Pûshan, and to the  
Gods the sacrifice announceth.  
28 Invoker, ministering priest, stoner, fire-kindler, Soma-presser,  
sage, reciter,  
With this well ordered sacrifice, well finished, do ye fill full  
the channels of the rivers.  
29 The hewers of the post and those who carry it, and those  
who carve the knob to deck the Horse's stake;  
Those who prepare the cooking-vessels for the Steed,—may  
the approving help of these promote our work.  
30 Forth, for the regions of the Gods, the Charger with his  
smooth back is come; my prayer attends him.  
In him rejoice the singer and the sages. A good friend  
have we won for the Gods’ banquet.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

31 May the fleet Courser's halter and his heel-ropes, the headstall  
and the girths and cords about him,  
And the grass put within his mouth to bait him,—among  
the Gods, too, let all these be with thee.  
32 What part of the Steed's flesh the fly hath eaten, or is left  
sticking to the post or hatchet,  
Or to the slayer's hands and nails adhereth,—among the  
Gods, tog, may all this he with thee.  
33 Food undigested steaming from his belly, and any odour of  
raw flesh remaining,  
This let the immolators set in order and dress the sacrifice  
with perfect cooking.  
34 What from thy body which with fire is roasted, when thou  
art set upon the spit, distilleth,—  
Let not that lie on earth or grass neglected, but to the longing  
Gods let all be offered.  
35 They who, observing that the Horse is ready, call out and  
say, The smell is good; remove it;  
And, craving meat, await the distribution,—may their  
approving help promote our labour.  
36 The trial-fork of the flesh cooking caldron, the vessels out  
of which the broth is sprinkled,  
The warming-pots, the covers of the dishes, hooks,  
carving-boards,—all these attend the Charger.  
37 Let not the fire, smoke-scented, make thee crackle, nor  
glowing caldron smell and break to pieces.  
Offered, beloved, approved, and consecrated,—such Charger  
do the Gods accept with favour.  
38 The starting-place, his place of rest and rolling, the ropes  
wherewith the Charger's feet were fastened,  
The water that he drank, the food he tasted,—among the  
Gods, too, may all these attend thee.  
39 The robe they spread upon the Horse to clothe him, the  
upper covering and the golden trappings,  
The halters which restrain the Steed, the heel-ropes,—all  
these, as grateful to the Gods, they offer.  
40 If one, when seated, with excessive urging hath with his  
heel or with his whip distressed thee,  
All these thy woes, as with oblation's ladle at sacrifices,  
with my prayer I banish.  
41 The four-and-thirty ribs of the swift Courser, kin to the  
Gods, the slayer's hatchet pierces.

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

Cut ye with skill so that the parts be flawless, and piece by  
piece declaring them dissect them.  
42 Of Tvashtar's Courser there is one dissector: this is the  
custom: two there are who guide him.  
Such of his limbs as I divide in order, all these, amid the  
lumps, in fire I offer.  
43 Let not thy dear soul burn thee as thou comest, let not the  
hatchet linger in thy body.  
Let not a greedy clumsy immolator, missing the joints,  
mangle thy limbs unduly.  
44 No, here thou diest not, thou art not injured: only by easy  
paths to Gods thou goest.  
Both Bays, both Spotted Mares are now thy fellows, and to  
the Ass's pole is yoked the Courser.  
45 May this Steed bring us all-sustaining riches, wealth in  
good kine, good horses, manly offspring.  
Freedom from sin may Aditi vouchsafe us; the Steed with  
our oblations gain us lordship!  
46 We will, with Indra and all Gods to help us, bring these  
existing worlds into subjection.  
With the Âdityas, with the band of Maruts, may Indra  
give us medicine to heal us.  
Our sacrifice, our bodies, and our offspring may Indra  
regulate with the Âdityas.  
47 O Agni, be our nearest Friend, etc., as in III. 25.  
To thee then, O Most Bright, etc., as in III. 26.
