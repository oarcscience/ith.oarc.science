### BOOK THE FOURTH.

WE have reached this earth's place of sacrificing, the place  
wherein all Deities delighted.  
Crossing by Rik, by Sâman, and by Yajus, may we rejoice  
in food and growth of riches.  
Gracious to me be these Celestial Waters!  
Protect me, Plant. O Knife, forbear to harm him.  
2 The Mother Floods shall make us bright and shining, cleansers  
of holy oil, with oil shall cleanse us.  
For, Goddesses, they bear off all defilement. I rise up  
from them purified and brightened.  
The form of Consecration and of Fervour art thou. I put  
thee on, the kind and blissful, maintaining an agreeable  
appearance.  
3 The Great Ones’ milk art thou. Giver of splendour art  
thou: bestow on me the gift of splendour.  
Pupil art thou of Vritra's eye. The giver of eyes art thou.  
Give me the gift of vision.  
4 Purify me the Lord of Thought! Purify me the Lord of  
Speech! Purify me God Savitar with perfect strainer, with  
the beams of Sûrya!

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

Of thee, Lord of the Strainer! who art by the strainer  
purified,  
With what desire I purify myself, may I accomplish it.  
5 We come to you for precious wealth, O Gods, as sacrifice  
proceeds.  
O Gods, we call on you to give blessings that wait on sacrifice.  
6 Svâhâ! from mind the sacrifice. Svâhâ! from spacious  
firmament.  
Svâhâ! from Dyaus and Prithivî. Svâhâ! from Wind I  
seize. Svâhâ!  
7 To Resolution, Motive, Agni, Svâhâ! All-hail to Wisdom,  
and to Mind, and Agni!  
All-hail to Consecration, Fervour, Agni! Hail to Sarasvatî,  
Pûshan, and Agni!  
Ye vast, divine, all-beneficial Waters, ye Heaven and Earth  
and spacious Air between them,  
Let us adore Brihaspati with oblation. All-hail!  
8 May every mortal man elect the friendship of the guiding  
God.  
Each one solicits him for wealth: let him seek fame to prosper  
him.  
9 Rik's, Sâman's counterparts are ye. I touch you. Protect  
me till the sacrifice be ended.  
Thou art a place of refuge. Give me refuge. Obeisance  
unto thee! Forbear to harm me.  
10 Strength of Angirases art thou. Wool-soft, bestow thou  
strength on me.  
Thou art the garment-knot of Soma. Vishnu's refuge art  
thou, the Sacrificer's refuge.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

Thou art the womb of Indra. Make the crops produce  
abundant grain.  
Stand up erect, O Tree. Protect me from harm until this  
sacrifice be ended.  
11 Prepare ye vow-food. Agni is the Brahman, Agni is sacrifice,  
the tree is holy.  
For aid we meditate divine Intelligence, most merciful,  
Free-giver, bringing worship May it guide us gently, as  
we would.  
Favour us Gods, mind-horn, endowed with mind and intellectual  
might! All-hail to them! May they be our protectors.  
12 Waters that we have drunk! become refreshing, become  
auspicious draughts within our belly.  
Free from all sin and malady and sickness, may they be  
pleasant to our taste, divine Ones, immortal, strengtheners  
of eternal Order.  
13 This is thy sacrificial form.  
Not offspring, waters I discharge. Freeing from sin and  
consecrate by Svâhâ enter ye the earth. Be thou united  
with the earth.  
14 O Agni, watch thou well. May we take joy in most refreshing  
sleep.  
Protect us with unceasing care. From slumber waken us  
again.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

15 Thought hath returned to me, and life; my breath and  
soul have come again.  
Our bodies' guard, unscathed, Vaisvânara Agni preserve us  
from misfortune and dishonour.  
16 Thou, Agni, art the guardian God of sacred vows among  
mankind, thou meet for praise at holy rites.  
Grant this much, Soma! bring yet more. God Savitar who  
giveth wealth hath given treasure unto us.  
17 This is thy form, O Bright One, this thy lustre. Combine  
with this thy form and go to splendour.  
Impetuous art thou, upheld by mind, and Vishnu loveth  
thee.  
18 Moved by thine impulse who hast true impulsion, may I  
obtain a prop to stay my body.  
Pure art thou, glistering art thou, immortal, dear to all the  
Gods.  
19 Thought art thou, mind, intelligence, the Guerdon, royal,  
worshipful, Aditi with a double head. Succeed for us in  
going forth, succeed for us in thy return. May Mitra  
bind thee by the foot. May Pûshan guard thy pathways  
for Indra whose eye is over all.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

20 Thy mother give thee leave to go, thy father, thine own  
brother, and thy friend of the same herd with thee!  
Go thou, O Goddess, to the God. To Soma go for Indra's  
sake.  
May Rudra turn thee back. Return safely with Soma as  
thy friend.  
21 Thou art a Vasvî, thou art Aditi, thou art an Âdityâ, thou  
art a Rudrâ, thou art a Chandrâ.  
Brihaspati vouchsafe thee rest and comfort! Rudra with  
Vasus looks on thee with favour.  
22 On Aditi's head I sprinkle thee, on the earth's place of  
sacrifice.  
Footstep of Idâ art thou, filled with fatness. Hail!  
Rejoice in us. Thy kinship is in us. In thee are riches.  
Mine be riches! Let us not be deprived of abundant  
riches. Thine, thine are riches.  
23 I with my thought have commerced with divine far-sighted  
Dakshinâ.  
Steal not my life. I will not thine. May I, O Goddess, in  
thy sight find for myself a hero son.  
24 Tell Soma this for me: This is thy share allied with Gâyatrî.  
For me say this to Soma: This is thine allotted Trishtup  
share.  
Tell Soma this for me: This is thy share allied with Jagatî.  
Tell Soma this for me: Win thou sole lordship of the metres’  
names.  
Ours art thou: pure thy juice for draught. Let separators  
pick thee out.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

25 I sing my song of praise to him, Savitar, God between the  
Bowls, strong with the wisdom of the wise, of true impulsion,  
wealth-giver, the well-beloved thoughtful Sage.  
To him at whose impulsion shone aloft in heaven the splendid  
light.  
Most wise, the Golden-handed hath measured the sky with  
skilled design.  
For living creatures, thee. Let living creatures breathe  
after thee. Breathe after living creatures.  
26 Thee who art pure, with what is pure I purchase, the bright  
with bright, immortal with immortal.  
The Sacrificer keep thy cow. Let thy gold pieces be with us.  
Fervour's form art thou, and Prajâpati's nature. With the  
most noble animal art thou purchased. May I increase  
with thousandfold abundance.  
27 As friend, the giver of good friends, approach us!  
Take thou thy seat on the right thigh of Indra, yearning on  
yearning, pleasing on the pleasing.  
Anghâri, Svâna, Bhrâja, and Bambhâri, O Hasta, and Suhasta  
and Krisânu,  
These are your prices for the Soma purchase. Keep them  
securely, let them never fail you.  
28 Keep me, O Agni, from unrighteous conduct: make me a  
sharer in the path of goodness.

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

I, following Immortals, have arisen with longer life, with a  
good life before me.  
29 Now have we entered on the path that leads to bliss without  
a foe,  
The path whereon a man escapes all enemies and gathers  
wealth.  
30 The skin of Aditi art thou. Sit on the lap of Aditi.  
The Bull hath propped the sky and air's mid-region, the  
compass of the broad earth hath he measured.  
He, King Supreme, approached all living creatures. Truly  
all these are Varuna's ordinances.  
31 Over the woods the air hath he extended, put milk in kine  
and vigorous speed in horses,  
Set intellect in hearts and fire in houses, Sûrya in heaven  
and Soma on the mountain.  
32 Ascend the eye of Sûrya, mount the pupil set in Agni's eye  
Where, radiant through the Wise One, thou speedest along  
with dappled steeds.  
33 Approach, ye oxen, fit to bear the yoke; be yoked without  
a tear.  
Slaying no man, urging the Brahman forward, go happily  
to the Sacrificer's dwelling.  
34 Lord of the World, thou art my gracious helper: move forward  
on thy way to all the stations.  
Let not opponents, let not robbers find thee, let not malignant  
wolves await thy coming.  
Fly thou away having become a falcon. Go to the dwelling  
of the Sacrificer. That is the special place for us to rest in.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

35 Do homage unto Varuna's and Mitra's eye: offer this solemn  
worship to the Mighty God,  
Who seeth far away, the Ensign born of Gods. Sing praises  
unto Sûrya, to the Son of Dyaus.  
36 Thou art a prop for Varuna to rest on. Ye are the pins that  
strengthen Varuna's pillar.  
Thou art the lawful seat where Varuna sitteth. Sit on the  
lawful seat where Varuna sitteth.  
37 Such of thy glories as with poured oblations men honour,  
may they all invest our worship.  
Wealth-giver, furtherer with troops of heroes, sparing the  
brave, come, Soma, to our houses.
