### BOOK THE FIFTEENTH.

DRIVE our born enemies away, O Agni; drive from us foes  
unborn, O Jâtavedas.  
Graciously-minded, free from anger, bless us: may we enjoy  
my firm thrice-guarding shelter.  
Drive off with might our foemen born and living: keep off  
these yet unborn, O Jâtavedas.  
Benevolent in thought and spirit bless us. May we remain  
alive: drive off our foemen.  
3 The Sixteenfold Stoma, strength and wealth. The Forty-  
fourth Stoma, splendour and wealth.  
Apsas art thou, the complement of Agni. As such may all  
the Gods greet thee with praises.  
Enriched with songs of praise, Prishthas, and butter, sit here  
and give us wealth with store of children.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

23 Guide of the rite art thou and of the region to which with  
thine auspicious teams thou tendest.  
Thy light-bestowing head to heaven thou liftest, making thy  
tongue oblation-bearer, Agni.  
24 Agni is wakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who  
cometh like a milch-cow.  
Like young trees shooting up on high their branches his  
flames are rising to the vault of heaven.  
25 To him adorable, sage, strong and mighty we have sung  
forth our song of praise and homage.  
Gavishthira hath raised with prayer to Agni this laud  
far-reaching as the gold in heaven.  
26 Here by ordainers was this God appointed first Invoker, best  
at worship, to be praised at rites;  
Whom Apnavâna and the Bhrigus caused to shine bright-coloured  
in the wood, spreading to every house.  
27 The watchful Guardian of the people hath been born, Agni  
the very strong, for fresh prosperity.  
With oil upon his face, with high heaven-touching flame, he  
shineth splendidly, pure for the Bharatas.  
28 Agni, Angirases discovered thee what time thou layest hidden,  
fleeing back from wood to wood.  
Thou by attrition art produced as conquering, might, and  
men, O Angiras, call thee the Son of Strength.  
29 Offer to Agni, O my friends, your seemly food, your seemly  
praise;  
To him supremest o’er the folk, the Son of Strength, the  
Mighty Lord.  
30 Thou, mighty Agni, gatherest up all that is precious for thy  
friend:  
Bring us all treasure as thou art enkindled in libation's place.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

31 O Agni, loved of many, thou of fame most wondrous, in  
their homes  
Men call on thee whose hair is flame to be the bearer of  
their gifts.  
32 With this my reverent hymn I call Agni for you, the Son.  
of Strength,  
Dear, wisest envoy, served with noble sacrifice, immortal  
messenger of all.  
33 Immortal messenger of all, immortal messenger of all,  
His two red steeds, all-cherishing; he harnesseth: let him,  
well-worshipped, urge them fast.  
34 Let him well-worshipped urge them fast, let him  
well-worshipped urge them fast.  
Then hath the sacrifice good prayer and happy end, and  
heavenly gift of wealth to men.  
35 O Agni, thou who art the Lord of wealth in kine, the Son  
of Strength,  
Vouchsafe to us, O Jâtavedas, high renown.  
36 He, Agni, kindled, good and wise, must be exalted in our  
song:  
Shine, thou of many forms, shine radiantly on us.  
37 O Agni, shining of thyself by night and when the morning  
breaks,  
Burn, thou whose teeth are sharp, against the Râkshasas.  
38 May Agni, worshipped, bring us bliss, may the gift, Blessed  
One! and sacrifice bring bliss,  
Yea, may our praises bring us bliss.  
39 Yea, may our praises bring us bliss. Show forth the mind  
that brings success in war with fiends, wherewith thou  
conquerest in fights:  
40 Wherewith thou conquerest in fights. Bring down the many  
firm hopes of our enemies, and let us vanquish with thine  
aid.

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

41 I value Agni, that good Lord, the home to which the kind  
return;  
Whom fleet-foot coursers seek as home, and strong enduring  
steeds as home. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.  
42 ’Tis Agni whom we laud as good, to whom the milch-kine  
come in herds,  
To whom the coursers swift of foot, to whom our well-born  
princes come. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.  
43 Thou, brilliant God, within thy mouth warmest both ladles  
of the oil.  
So fill us also in our hymns abundantly, O Lord of Strength.  
Bring food to those who sing thy praise.  
44 Agni, with lauds this day may we bring thee that which  
thou lovest,  
Right judgment, like a horse, with our devotions.  
45 For thou hast ever been the car-driver, Agni, of noble  
Strength, lofty sacrifice, and rightful judgment.  
46 Through these our praises come thou to meet us, bright as  
the sunlight,  
O Agni, well-disposed, with all thine aspects.  
47 Agni I hold as Herald, the munificent, the gracious Son of  
Strength who knoweth all that live, as holy singer knowing  
all;  
Lord of fair rites, a God with form erected, turning to the  
Gods,  
He, when the flame hath sprung forth from the sacred oil,  
the offered fatness, longeth for it with his glow.  
48 O Agni, be our nearest Friend, be thou a kind deliverer and  
a gracious Friend.  
Come as good Agni, come as excellent and give us wealth  
most splendidly renowned.  
To thee then, O most bright, O radiant God, we come with  
prayer for happiness for our friends.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

49 With what devotion, winning light, the Rishis came, kindling  
Agni, to the Holy session,  
Even with that in heaven I stablish Agni whom men call  
him whose sacred grass is scattered.  
50 Gods, let us follow him with wives beside us, with sons, with  
brothers, with our gold adornments,  
Grasping the sky up in the world of virtue, on the third  
height, the luminous realm of heaven.  
51 This Agni mounted up to Speech's Centre, Lord of the  
Brave, observant, ever-active.  
Laid on the back of Earth, may he, resplendent, cast under  
foot those who would fight against us.  
52 May this most manly Agni, strength-bestower, giver of thousands,  
shine with care that fails not.  
Resplendent in the middle of the water, make thine approach  
to the celestial mansions.  
53 Make him go forth from all sides: meet, Approach ye. O  
Agni, make the paths for Godward travel.  
Making the Parents young with life's renewal, the out spun  
thread in thee have they extended.  
54 Wake up, O Agni, thou, and keep him watchful. Wish and  
fruition, meet, and he, together.  
In this and in the loftier habitation be seated, All-Gods!  
and the Sacrificer.  
55 Convey our sacrifice to heaven that it may reach the God  
with that

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

Whereby thou, Agni, bearest wealth in thousands and all  
precious things.  
6 56 This is thine ordered place of birth whence sprung to life  
thou shonest forth.  
Knowing this, Agni, rise thou up and cause our riches to  
increase.  
57 Tapa, Tapasya, pair of Dewy Seasons: thou art, etc. (as  
in XIII. 25).  
58 On the sky's back may Parameshthin lay thee, etc. (as in  
XIV. 14).  
Thy Lord is Sûrya, etc. (as in XIV. 14).  
59 Repeated from XII. 54.  
60 Repeated from XII. 55.  
61 Repeated from XII. 56.  
62 Like a horse neighing, eager for the pasture, when he hath  
stepped forth from the great enclosure:  
Then the wind following blows upon his splendour, and,  
straight, the path is black which thou hast travelled.  
63 In Âyu's seat I set thee, in the shadow of the protector in  
the heart of Ocean,  
Thee luminous, bright with eyes, thee who illumest the sky,  
the earth, and air's broad realm between them.  
64 On the sky's back may Parameshthin set thee, etc. (as in  
XIV. 12, substituting sky for air and Sûrya for Vâyu).  
65 Thou art the measure of a thousand. Thou art the representative  
of a thousand. Thou art the equivalent of a thousand. Thou art  
worth a thousand. Thee for a thousand.
