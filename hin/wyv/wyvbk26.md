### BOOK THE TWENTY-SIXTH.

AGNI and Prithivî, closely connected, may they bring low for  
me the boon I mention.  
Vâyu and Firmament, closely connected, may they, etc.  
Closely connected Dyaus and the Âditya, may they, etc.  
Closely connected Varuna and Waters, may they, etc.  
Lord of the seven communities and her who forms all beings,  
eighth,  
Make our ways full of pleasantness: may So-and-So and I  
agree.  
2 That I to all the people may address this salutary speech,  
To priest and nobleman, Sûdra and Arya, to one of our own  
kin and to the stranger.  
Dear may I be to Gods and guerdon-giver. Fulfilled be this  
my hope: be that my portion!  
3 Give us, Brihaspati, that wondrous treasure, that which  
exceeds the merit of the foeman,  
Which shines among the folk effectual, splendid, that, Son  
of Law, which is with might refulgent.  
Taken upon a base art thou. Thee for Brihaspati. This is  
thy home. Thee for Brihaspati,  
4 Come hither, Indra, rich in kine! Drink Soma, Lord of  
Hundred Powers,  
Effused by braying pressing-stones.  
Taken upon a base art thou. Thee for Indra, rich in kine.  
This is thy home. Thee for Indra, rich in kine.

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

5 O Indra, Vritra-slayer, come. Drink Soma, Lord of  
Hundred Powers,  
Expressed with stones whose wealth is kine.  
Taken upon a base art thou, etc., as in verse 4.  
6 Vaisvânara the righteous One, the Lord of sacrifice and light,  
The heat that wasteth not, we seek.  
Taken upon a base art thou. Thee for Vaisvânara.  
This is thy home: thee for Vaisvânara.  
7 Still in Vaisvânara's grace may we continue: yea, he is  
King Supreme o’er all things living.  
Sprung hence to life upon this All he looketh. Vaisvânara  
hath rivalry with Sûrya.  
Taken upon a base art thou, etc., as in verse 6.  
8 Hitherward come Vaisvânara to succour us from far away,  
Agni through laud that brings him near!  
Taken upon a base, etc, as in verse 6.  
9 Agni is Pavamâna, Sage, the Tribe-Priest of the Races Five:  
To him of mighty wealth we pray.  
Taken upon a base art thou. Thee for lustre. This is thy  
home. Thee for lustre.  
10 May mighty Indra, thunder-armed, may Shodasî protect us  
well, and slay the wicked man who hateth us.  
Taken upon a base art thou. Thee for Mahendra. This is  
thy home. Thee for Mahendra.  
11 As cows low to their calves in stalls so with our songs we  
glorify  
This Indra, e’en your wondrous God who checks assault,  
who joys in the delicious juice.  
12 Agni's is the most fetching song. Shine mightily, thou rich  
in light!  
Like the Chief Consort of a King, riches and strength proceed  
from thee.

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

13 Come, here, O Agni, will I sing verily other songs to thee,  
And with these drops shalt thou grow strong.  
14 The Seasons spread thy sacrifice! the Mouths protect thine  
offering!  
May the Year guard our sacrifice for thee and keep our children  
safe.  
15 There where the mountains downward slope, there by the  
meeting of the streams  
The sage was manifest with song.  
16 High is thy juice's birth: though sat in heaven, on earth it  
hath obtained  
Strong sheltering power and great renown.  
17 Finder of room and freedom, flow for Indra, meet for worship,  
flow  
For Varuna and the Marut host.  
18 Striving to win, with him we gain all wealth of the ungodly  
one,  
Yea, all the glories of mankind.  
19 May we be prosperous with brave sons, cattle, horses, each  
wish of ours, and varied blessings,  
With quadrupeds, and with the men about us. May the  
Gods guide our sacrifice in season.  
20 O Agni, bring thou hitherward the yearning Consorts of the  
Gods  
Bring Tvashtar to the Soma-draught.  
21 O Neshtar girt by Dames, accept our sacrifice: with Ritu  
drink,  
For thou art he who giveth wealth.

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

22 He with the Ritus fain would drink, Wealth-river, from the  
Neshtar's bowl.  
Begin, pay offerings: hasten ye.  
28 Thine is this Soma: come thou near, approach it. Drink  
thou thereof, benevolent, and cease not.  
Sit on the sacred grass at this our worship, and take these  
drops into thy belly, Indra.  
24 Come unto us, ye swift to listen! as at home, upon the  
sacred grass sit and enjoy yourselves.  
And, Tvashtar, well content be joyful in the juice with Gods  
and Goddesses in gladsome company.  
25 In sweetest and most gladdening stream flow pure, O Soma,  
on thy way,  
Pressed out for Indra, for his drink.  
26 Fiend-queller, Friend of all men, he hath in the vat attained  
unto  
His place, his iron-fashioned home.
