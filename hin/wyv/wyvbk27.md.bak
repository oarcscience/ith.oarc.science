### BOOK THE TWENTY-SEVENTH

HALF-YEARS and Seasons strengthen thee, O Agni, the Years  
and all the Verities and Rishis!  
Flash forth with thy celestial effulgence: illumine all four  
regions of the heaven.  
2 Kindle thee, Agni, rake this man to knowledge: rise up  
erect for great and happy fortune.  
Agni, be those uninjured who adore thee, thy priests be  
glorious and none beside them!  
3 The Brahmans present here elect thee, Agni: be thou  
propitious in our sanctuary.  
Slayer of rivals, Agni, quell our foemen: watch in thy house  
with care that never ceases.  
4 Even here do thou, O Agni, stablish wealth: let not oppressors  
injure thee by thinking of thee first.  
Light be thy task of ruling, Agni, with thy power: may he  
who worships thee wax strong, invincible.  
5 Kind to the people, grasp thy power, O Agni: contend thou  
with the Friend by way of friendship.  
Placed, Agni, in the centre of our kinsmen, flash forth to be  
invoked by Kings around thee.  
6 Past those who slay, past enemies, past thoughtless men,  
past those who hate,—  
Yes, Agni, drive away all woe and trouble: vouchsafe us  
opulence with men about us.  
7 Holder of sway, shine here refulgent, Agni! invincible,  
unconquered Jâtavedas.  
Light all the regions, chasing human terrors: with happy  
helps guard us to-day for increase.

8 Brihaspati, Savitar, give this man knowledge: sharpen him  
thoroughly though already sharpened.  
To great and high felicity exalt him: in him let all the Gods  
rejoice and triumph.  
9 As thou, Brihaspati, from curse hast freed us, from dwelling  
yonder in the realm of Yama,  
The Asvins, Leeches of the Gods, O Agni, have chased Death  
far from us with mighty powers.  
10 Looking upon the loftier light, etc., as in XX. 21.  
11 Uplifted are the brands that are his fuel: lofty and brilliant  
are the flames of Agni,  
Splendidly bright of the Son fair of aspect.  
13 Tanûnapât the Asura, all-possessing, God among Gods, the  
God with mead and butter shall bedew the paths.  
13 With mead to sacrifice thou comest, Agni, earnest as friendly-  
minded Narâsamsa, and Savitar righteous God who brings  
all blessings.  
14 He cometh hitherward with power and fatness, the luminous,  
implored with adoration.  
While rites proceed the ladles move to Agni.  
15 Let him pay worship to this Agni's greatness, daintily fed:  
he verily gives enjoyments:  
The wisest Vasu he, and best wealth giver.  
16 Widely expansive, ruling by foundation, the Doors divine—  
and, after, all—  
Preserve this Agni's holy works.  
17 May Dawn and Night protect—his heavenly Consorts—in  
a his home this our sacrificial worship.  
18 Ye two celestial Hotars, greet with praises this lofty rite of  
ours, the tongue of Agni.  
Cause that our sacrifice be well conducted.

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

19 Upon this grass three Goddesses be seated, Idâ, Sarasvatî,  
Bhâratî the Mighty glorified with song.  
20 This our productive wondrous flow may Tvashtar pour down  
on this man's kin, and wealth and heroes.  
21 Vanaspatî, presenting of thyself, send God-ward! Let Agni,  
Immolator, season our oblation.  
22 Pay sacrifice to Indra, Jâtavedas Agni! with Hail! All Gods  
accept the gift we offer!  
23 Wise, bright, arranger of his teams, he seeketh men with  
rich food whose treasures are abundant.  
They have stood firm of one accord with Vâyu: yea, the  
men wrought all noble operations.  
24 The God whom both these worlds brought forth for riches,  
whom heavenly Dhishanâ for our wealth appointeth—  
His team of harnessed horses waits on Vâyu and, foremost,  
on the radiant treasure-holder.  
26 What time the mighty waters came containing the universal  
germ, producing Agni,  
Thence sprang the Gods’ one spirit into being. What God  
shall we adore with our oblation?  
26 Who in his might surveyed the floods enclosing productive  
force and generating Worship,  
He who is God mid Gods, and none beside him—What God  
shall we adore with our oblation?  
27 The teams wherewith thou seekest him who offers, within  
his house, O Vâyu, to direct him,  
Therewith send wealth to us with full enjoyment, a hero son  
and gifts of kine and horses.  
28 With thy yoked teams in hundreds and in thousands come  
to our sacrifice and solemn worship.  
O Vâyu, make thee glad at this libation. Preserve us evermore,  
ye Gods, with blessings.

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

29 Drawn by thy team, O Vâyu, come: to thee is offered this,  
the pure.  
Thou visitest the presser's house.  
30 Vâyu, the bright is offered thee, best of the meath at holy  
rites.  
Come thou to drink the Soma juice, God longed-for, on thy  
team-drawn car.  
31 Lover of worship, leader, come Vâyu with thought, to sacrifice,  
Propitious with propitious teams!  
32 With all the thousand chariots that are thine, O Vâyu, come  
to us,  
Team-drawn, to drink the Soma juice.  
33 Come thou with one, and ten, O Self-Existent! with two  
unto the sacrifice, and twenty.  
Three are the teams and thirty which convey thee. O Vâyu,  
in this place unyoke thy coursers.  
34 Wonderful Vâyu, Lord of Truth, thou who art Tvashtar's  
Son in-law,  
Thy saving succour we elect.  
35 Like kine unmilked we call aloud, Hero, to thee and sing  
thy praise,  
Looker on heavenly light, Lord of this moving world, Lord,  
Indra! of what moveth not.  
36 None other like to thee, of earth or of the heavens, hath  
been or ever will be born.  
Desiring horses, Indra, Bounteous Lord! and kine, as men  
of might we call on thee.  
37 That we may win us wealth and power, we poets call on  
only thee.  
In war men call on thee, Indra! the hero's Lord, in the  
steed's race-course call on thee.  
38 As such, O Wonderful, whose hand holds thunder, praised  
as mighty, Caster of the Stone!

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

Pour on us boldly, Indra, kine and chariot-steeds ever to be  
the conqueror's strength.  
39 What succour will he bring to us, wonderful, ever-prospering  
Friend?  
With what most mighty company?  
40 What, genuine and most liberal draught will spirit thee with  
juice to burst  
Open e’en strongly-guarded wealth  
41 Do thou who art protector of us thy friends who praise thee  
With hundred aids approach us.  
42 Sing to your Agni with each song, at every sacrifice, for  
strength.  
Come, let us praise the Wise and Everlasting God even as a  
well-belovèd Friend.  
43 Protect us, Agni, through the first, protect us through the  
second hymn.  
Protect us through three hymns, O Lord of Power and Might;  
through four hymns, Vasu! guard thou us.  
44 The Son of Strength; for is he not our Friend? Let us serve  
him for offering our gifts.  
In battles may he be our help and strengthener, yea, be the  
saviour of our lives.  
45 Thou art Samvatsara; thou art Parivatsara; thou art  
Idâvatsara; thou art Idvatsara; thou art Vatsara.  
Prosper thy Dawns! Prosper thy Day-and-Nights! Prosper  
thy Half-months, Months, Seasons, and Years!  
Combine them for their going and their coming, and send  
then forward on their ordered courses.  
In eagle's shape thou art piled up and layered. With that  
divinity, Angiras-like, lie steady.
