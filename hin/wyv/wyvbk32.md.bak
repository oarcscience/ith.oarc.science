### BOOK THE THIRTY-SECOND.

AGNI is That; the Sun is That; Vâyu and Chandramâs are  
That.  
The Bright is That; Brahma is That, those Waters, that  
Prajâpati.  
2 All twinklings of the eyelid sprang from Purusha,  
resplendent One.  
No one hath comprehended him above, across, or in the  
midst.  
3 There is no counterpart of him whose glory verily is great.  
In the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, etc. Let not him  
harm me, etc. Than whom there is no other born, etc.  
4 This very God pervadeth all the regions; yea, born aforetime,  
in the womb he dwelleth.  
He verily born and to be born hereafter meeteth his offspring,  
facing all directions.  
5 Before whom naught whatever sprang to being; who with  
his presence aids all living creatures,  
Prajâpati, rejoicing in his offspring, he, Shodasî, maintains  
the Three great Lustres.  
6 By whom the heavens are strong and earth stands firmly,  
by whom light's realm and sky-vault are supported;  
By whom the regions in mid-air were measured. What  
God shall we adore with our oblation?

7 To whom, supported by his help, two armies embattled look  
while trembling in their spirit,  
Where over them the risen Sun is shining. What God shall  
we adore with our oblation?  
What time the mighty waters, etc. He in his might surveyed, etc.  
8 The Sage beholdeth That mysterious Being wherein this  
All hath found one only dwelling.  
Therein unites the Whole, and thence it issues: far-spread it  
is the warp and woof in creatures.  
9 Knowing Eternity, may the Gandharva declare that station,  
parted, kept in secret.  
Three steps thereof in mystery are hidden: he who knows  
these shall be the father's father.  
10 He is our kin, our Father and Begetter: he knows all beings  
and all Ordinances,  
In whom the Gods obtaining life eternal have risen upward  
to the third high station.  
11 Having encompassed round existing creatures, the world;  
and all the Quarters and Mid-quarters,  
Having [approached](errata.htm#15.md) the first-born Child of Order he with
his  
Self into The Self hath entered.

12 Having gone swiftly round the earth and heaven, around  
the worlds, around the sky, the Quarters,  
Having spread out the lengthened thread of Order, he views,  
and he becomes and is That Being.  
13 To the Assembly's wondrous Lord, to Indra's lovely Friend  
who gives  
Wisdom. have I drawn near in prayer.  
14 That wisdom which the Companies of Gods, and Fathers,  
recognize,  
Even with that intelligence, O Agni, make me wise to-day.  
All-hail!  
15 Varuna grant me wisdom! grant it Agni and Prajâpati!  
Wisdom may Indra, Vâyu grant. May the Creator grant it  
me. All-hail!  
16 Let these the Priests and Nobles both enjoy the splendour  
that is mine.  
Best splendour may the Gods bestow on me. To thee, that  
splendour, hail!
