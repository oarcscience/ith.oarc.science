### PRA*S*NA III, ADHYÂYA 6.

1\. Now if a man feels his conscience charged with (evil) actions
committed by himself, let him boil for himself (alone), when the stars
have risen, a handful of barley, (and prepare) gruel (with that). <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[1](#fn_1360.md)

2\. Let him not perform the Vai*s*vadeva oblation with (a portion of)
that,

3\. Nor (shall) a Bali offering (be performed) on that (occasion).

4\. Let him consecrate the barley before it is boiled, while it is being
boiled, and after it has been boiled, with the (following) Mantras

5\. 'Thou art barley, thou art the king of grains, thou art sacred to
Varu*n*a and mixed with honey, the sages have proclaimed thee an
expeller of all guilt and a means of purification.' <span
id="fr_1361"></span>[5](#fn_1361.md)

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

'Ye barley-grains are clarified butter and honey, ye barley-grains are
water and ambrosia. May you remove my guilt and all my sins:'

'Those committed by words, by acts, and by evil thoughts; ill-fortune
and the night of all-destroying time,--all that avert from me, ye
barley-grains.'

'(From the sin of eating) food which had been worried by dogs or pigs,
or which had been defiled by crows and impure men, from the sin of
disobedience towards mother and father,--from all that purify me, ye
barley-grains.'

'From the dreadful (guilt of) mortal sins and of the crime (of serving)
a king, from the wrong done to infants or aged men, from (the guilt) of
stealing gold, of breaking my vows, of sacrificing for an un-worthy man,
of speaking evil of Brâhma*n*as,--from all that purify me, ye
barley-grains.'

'From (the sin of eating) the food of many men, of harlots and of
*S*ûdras, of (partaking of) funeral dinners and of (the food given by)
persons who are unclean on account of a death or a birth, of that given
by thieves, or at a funeral sacrifice offered to one who lately
died,--from all that purify me, ye barley-grains.'

6\. (While the barley) is being boiled, he must protect it (and recite
the text), 'Adoration to Rudra, the lord of created beings; pacified is
the sky;' the Anuvâka (beginning), 'Give strength;' the five sentences
(beginning), 'The gods who are seated in front, led by Agni;' the two
(texts), 'Do not hurt <span id="fr_1362"></span>[6](#fn_1362.md)

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

our offspring,' (and) 'The Brahman-priest among the gods.'

7\. Having purified himself (by sipping water, &c.), he shall eat a
little of the boiled (mess), after pouring it into (another) vessel.

8\. Let him offer it as a sacrifice to the soul, (reciting the text),
'May the gods, who are born from the internal organ and joined to the
internal organ, who are very strong, whose father is Daksha, protect us
(and) guard us; adoration to them, to them Svâhâ.' <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[8](#fn_1363.md)

9\. Let him who desires intelligence (subsist on such food during three
(days and) nights.

10\. A sinner who drinks it during six (days and) nights becomes pure.

11\. He who drinks it during seven (days and) nights is purified from
(the guilt of) the murder of a learned Brâhma*n*a, of violating a Guru's
bed, of stealing gold, and of drinking Surâ.

12\. He who drinks it during eleven (days and) nights, removes even the
sins committed by his ancestors.

13\. 'But he who during twenty-one days (drinks gruel made) of
barley-grains which have passed through a cow, sees the *G*a*n*as and
the lord of the *G*a*n*as, sees the goddess of learning and the lord of
learning.' Thus speaks the venerable Baudhâyana.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1360"></span>[297:1](sbe1478.htm#fr_1360.md) **6**. For the
whole Adhyâya compare Vish*n*u XLVIII.

<span id="fn_1361"></span>[297:5](sbe1478.htm#fr_1361.md) According to
Govinda, Vâmadeva is the *Ri*shi of these Mantras. The phrase, 'Thou art
sacred to Varu*n*a,' is to be explained, according to Govinda, by the
fact that offerings presented to Varu*n*a frequently consist of barley.
'Honey' means, according to some, 'sweet butter,' with which the dish is
seasoned.

<span id="fn_1362"></span>[298:6](sbe1478.htm#fr_1362.md) The Anuvâka meant
is Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ I, 2, 14. The five sentences are found, ibid. I, 8,
7, 1. Regarding the text mâ nastoke, 'do not hurt our offspring,' see
above, III, 2, 9. The last <span id="page_299">p. 299</span> Mantra
occurs Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ III, 4, II, I. Govinda says that material
protection, too, in the shape of an iron platter or cover is to be given
to the boiling barley.

<span id="fn_1363"></span>[299:8](sbe1478.htm#fr_1363.md) The text occurs
Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ I, 2, 3, I. It consists of five sentences, and is
addressed to the five vital airs, to each of which the eater offers one
oblation.
