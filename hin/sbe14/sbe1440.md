### PRA*S*NA I, ADHYÂYA 4, KA*ND*IKÂ 7.

1\. 'Formerly (the use of) a waterpot has been prescribed by Brahman and
the chief sages for the purification of twice-born men. Therefore he
shall always carry one.' <span id="fr_822"></span>[1](#fn_822)

'He who desires his own welfare, shall use it without hesitation, for
purifying (his person), for drinking, and for performing his twilight
devotions.'

2\. Let him do it with a believing heart; a wise man must not corrupt
his mind. The self-existent <span id="fr_823"></span>[2](#fn_823)

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (Brahman) came into existence with a
water-vessel. Therefore let him perform (his rites) with a water-vessel.

3\. Let him hold it in his right hand when he voids urine and
excrements, in the left when he sips water. That is (a) settled (rule)
for all good men.

4\. For as the sacrificial cusp (*k*amasa) is declared to be pure on
account of its contact with the Soma-juice, even so the water-vessel is
constantly pure through its contact with water.

5\. Therefore let him avoid (to use) it for the worship of the manes,
the gods, and the fire. <span id="fr_824"></span>[5](#fn_824)

6\. Therefore let him not go on a journey without a waterpot, nor to the
boundary of the village, nor from one house to the other.

7\. Some (declare that he must not go without it) a step further than
the length of an arrow.

8\. Baudhâyana (says that he shall not go without it) if he wishes to
fulfil his duties constantly.

9\. (The divine) Word declares that (this is con-firmed) by a
*Ri*k-shaped (passage). <span id="fr_825"></span>[9](#fn_825)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_822"></span>[163:1](sbe1440.htm#fr_822) **7**. The division
of this chapter into two sections occurs in the M. manuscript only. The
Dekhan MSS., which give the division into Ka*nd*ikâs, do not note it,
and have at the end of the Pra*s*na the figure 20, while M. has 21 and
in words ekavi*ms*ati*h* after the enumeration of the Pratîkas.

<span id="fn_823"></span>[163:2](sbe1440.htm#fr_823) 'A wise man must
not corrupt his mind,' i.e. must not doubt or adopt erroneous views
regarding the teaching of the *S*âstras with respect to the waterpot. It
seems to me that this passage indicates the existence of an opposition
to the constant carrying of the waterpot in Baudhâyana's times. This is
so much more probable, as the custom is now obsolete, and is mentioned
in some Purâ*n*as and versified Sm*ri*tis as one of the practices
forbidden in the Kali age; see e*g*. the general note appended to Sir W.
Jones' translation of Manu.

<span id="fn_824"></span>[164:5](sbe1440.htm#fr_824) According to
Govinda the word 'therefore' refers back to Sûtra I, 4, 6, 14.

<span id="fn_825"></span>[164:9](sbe1440.htm#fr_825) '*Ri*gvidham, "a
*Ri*k-shaped (passage)," means *Ri*gvidhânam, "a prescription consisting
of a *Ri*k." The Brâhma*n*a is indicated by (the word) vâk, ("the
goddess of) speech." The meaning is, "The Brâhma*n*a says that there is
also a *Ri*k-verse to this effect. That is as follows, tasyaishâ bhavati
yat te *s*ilpam ityâdi' (Taittirîya-Âra*n*yaka I, 7, a).--Govinda.
