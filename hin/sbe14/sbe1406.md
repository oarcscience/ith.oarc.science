### CHAPTER III.

1\. (Brâhma*n*as) who neither study nor teach the Veda nor keep sacred
fires become equal to *S*ûdras; <span id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117.md)

2\. And they quote a verse of Manu on this (subject), 'A twice-born man,
who not having studied the Veda applies himself to other (and worldly
study), soon falls, even while living, to the condition of a *S*ûdra,
and his descendants after him.' <span id="fr_118"></span>[2](#fn_118.md)

3\. '(A twice-born man) who does not know the <span
id="fr_119"></span>[3](#fn_119.md)

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Veda (can)not be (called) a Brâhma*n*a, nor he
who lives by trade, nor he who (lives as) an actor, nor he who obeys a
*S*ûdra's commands, nor (he who like) a thief (takes the property of
others), nor he who makes his living by the practice of medicine.'

4\. 'The king shall punish that village where Brâhma*n*as, unobservant
of their sacred duties and ignorant of the Veda, subsist by begging; for
it feeds robbers.'

5\. 'Many thousands (of Brâhma*n*as) cannot form a (legal) assembly (for
declaring the sacred law), if they have not fulfilled their sacred
duties, are unacquainted with the Veda, and subsist only by the name of
their caste.' <span id="fr_120"></span>[5](#fn_120.md)

6\. 'That sin which dunces, perplexed by ignorance and unacquainted with
the sacred law, declare (to be duty) shall fall, increased a
hundredfold, on those who propound it.' <span
id="fr_121"></span>[6](#fn_121.md)

7\. 'What four or (even) three (Brâhma*n*as) who have completely studied
the Vedas proclaim, that must be distinctly recognised as the sacred
law, not (the decision) of a thousand fools.' <span
id="fr_122"></span>[7](#fn_122.md)

8\. 'Offerings to the gods and to the manes must always be given to a
*S*rotriya alone. For gifts

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

bestowed on a man unacquainted with the Veda, reach neither the
ancestors nor the gods.'

9\. 'If a fool lives even in one's house and a (Brâhma*n*a) deeply
learned in the Veda lives at a great distance, the learned man shall
receive the gift. The sin of neglecting (a Brâhma*n*a is not incurred)
in (the case of) a fool.' <span id="fr_123"></span>[9](#fn_123.md)

10\. 'The offence of neglecting a Brâhma*n*a cannot be committed against
a twice-born man who is ignorant of the Veda. For (in offering
sacrifices) one does not pass by a brilliant fire and throw the
oblations into ashes.' <span id="fr_124"></span>[10](#fn_124.md)

11\. An elephant made of wood, an antelope made of leather, and a
Brâhma*n*a ignorant of the Veda, those three have nothing but the name
(of their kind). <span id="fr_125"></span>[11](#fn_125.md)

12\. 'Those kingdoms, where ignorant men eat the food of the learned,
will be visited by drought; or (some other) great evil will befall
(them).'

13\. If anybody finds treasure (the owner of) which is not known, the
king shall take it, giving one sixth to the finder. <span
id="fr_126"></span>[13](#fn_126.md)

14\. If a Brâhma*n*a who follows the six (lawful) occupations, finds it,
the king shall not take it.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

15\. They declare that the slayer commits no crime by killing an
assassin. <span id="fr_127"></span>[15](#fn_127.md)

16\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'An incendiary,
likewise a poisoner, one who holds a weapon in his hand (ready to kill),
a robber, he who takes away land, and he who abducts (another man's)
wife, these six are called assassins (âtatâyin).'

17\. 'He may slay an assassin who comes with the intention of slaying,
even though he knows the whole Veda together with the Upanishads; by
that (act) he (does) not (incur the guilt of) the slayer of a
Brâhma*n*a.' <span id="fr_128"></span>[17](#fn_128.md)

18\. 'He who slays an assassin learned in the Veda and belonging to a
noble family, does not incur by that act the guilt of the murderer of a
learned Brâhma*n*a.; (in) that (case) fury recoils upon fury.'

19\. Persons who sanctify the company are, a Tri*n*â*k*iketa, one who
keeps five fires, a Trisupar*n*a, one who (knows the texts required for)
the four sacrifices (called A*s*vamedha, Purushamedha, Sarvamedha, and
Pit*ri*medha), one who knows the Vâ*g*asaneyi-*s*âkhâ of the White
Ya*g*ur-veda, one who knows the six Aṅgas, the son of a female married
according to the Brâhma-rite, one who knows the first part of the
Sâma-veda Sa*m*hitâ, one who sings the Gyesh*th*asâman, one who knows
the Sa*m*hitâ and the Brâhma*n*a, one who studies (the treatises on) the
sacred law, one whose ancestors to the ninth degree, both <span
id="fr_129"></span>[19](#fn_129.md)

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

on the mother's and on the father's side, are distinctly known to have
been *S*rotriyas, and learned men and Snâtakas.

20\. (Four students of) the four Vedas, one who knows the Mîmâ*m*sâ, one
who knows the Aṅgas, a teacher of the sacred law, and three eminent men
who are in three (different) orders, (compose) a (legal) assembly
consisting at least of ten (members). <span
id="fr_130"></span>[20](#fn_130.md)

21\. He who initiates (a pupil) and teaches him the whole Veda is called
the teacher (â*k*ârya). <span id="fr_131"></span>[21](#fn_131.md)

22\. But he who (teaches) a portion (of the Veda only is called) the
sub-teacher (upâdhyâya);

23\. So is he who (teaches) the Aṅgas of the Veda.

24\. A Brâhma*n*a and a Vai*s*ya may take up arms in self-defence, and
in (order to prevent) a confusion of the castes. <span
id="fr_132"></span>[24](#fn_132.md)

25\. But that (trade of arms) is the constant (duty) of a Kshatriya,
because he is appointed to protect (the people). <span
id="fr_133"></span>[25](#fn_133.md)

26\. Having washed his feet and his hands up to <span
id="fr_134"></span>[26](#fn_134.md)

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

the wrist, and sitting with his face turned towards the east or towards
the north, he shall thrice sip water out of the Tîrtha sacred to
Brahman, (i.e.) the part of the hand above the root of the thumb,
without uttering any sound;

27\. He shall twice wipe (his mouth with the root of the thumb);.

28\. He shall touch the cavities (of the head) with water;

29\. He shall pour water on his head and on the left hand;

30\. He shall not sip water while walking, standing., lying down or
bending forward. <span id="fr_135"></span>[30](#fn_135.md)

31\. A Brâhma*n*a (becomes pure) by (sipping) water, free from bubbles
and foam, that reaches his heart,

32\. But a Kshatriya by (sipping water) that reaches his throat,

33\. A Vai*s*ya by (sipping water) that wets his palate,

34\. A woman and a *S*ûdra by merely touching water (with the lips).

35\. Water (for sipping may) even (be taken) out of a hole in the
ground, if it is fit to slake the thirst of cows. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[35](#fn_136.md)

36\. (He shall not purify himself with water) which has been defiled
with colours, perfumes, or flavouring substances, nor with such as is
collected in unclean places. <span id="fr_137"></span>[36](#fn_137.md)

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

37\. Drops (of saliva) falling from the mouth, which do not touch a limb
of the body, do not make (a man) impure. <span
id="fr_138"></span>[37](#fn_138.md)

38\. If, after having sipped water, he sleeps, eats, sneezes, drinks,
weeps or bathes, or puts on a dress, he must again sip water, <span
id="fr_139"></span>[38](#fn_139.md)

39\. Likewise, if he touches (that part of) the lips on which no hair
grows. <span id="fr_140"></span>[39](#fn_140.md)

40\. No defilement is caused by the hair of the moustache (entering the
mouth). <span id="fr_141"></span>[40](#fn_141.md)

41\. If (remnants of food) adhere to the teeth, (they are pure) like the
teeth, and he is purified by swallowing those which (become detached) in
the mouth. <span id="fr_142"></span>[41](#fn_142.md)

42\. He is not defiled by the drops which fall on his feet, while
somebody gives to others water for sipping; they are stated to be
equally (clean) as the ground. <span id="fr_143"></span>[42](#fn_143.md)

43\. If, while occupied with eatables, he touches any impure substance,
then he shall place that thing (which he holds in his hand) on the
ground, sip water and afterwards again use it. <span
id="fr_144"></span>[43](#fn_144.md)

44\. Let him sprinkle with water all objects (the purity of) which may
be doubtful.

45\. 'Both wild animals killed by dogs, and fruit thrown by birds (from
the tree), what has been spoilt by children, and what has been handled
by women,' <span id="fr_145"></span>[45](#fn_145.md)

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

46\. 'A vendible commodity tendered for sale and what is not dirtied by
gnats and flies that have settled on it,' <span
id="fr_146"></span>[46](#fn_146.md)

47\. 'Likewise water collected on the ground that quenches the thirst of
cows,--enumerating all these things, the Lord of created beings has
declared them to be pure.' <span id="fr_147"></span>[47](#fn_147.md)

48\. Anything defiled by unclean (substances) becomes pure when the
stains and the smell have been removed by water and earth. <span
id="fr_148"></span>[48](#fn_148.md)

49\. (Objects) made of metal must be scoured with ashes, those made of
clay should be thoroughly heated by fire, those made of wood should be
planed, and (cloth) made of thread should be washed. <span
id="fr_149"></span>[49](#fn_149.md)

50\. Stones and gems (should be treated) like objects made of
metal, <span id="fr_150"></span>[50](#fn_150.md)

51\. Conch-shells and pearl-shells like gems,

52\. (Objects made of) bone like wood, <span
id="fr_151"></span>[52](#fn_151.md)

53\. Ropes, chips (of bamboo), and leather become pure (if treated) like
clothes, <span id="fr_152"></span>[53](#fn_152.md)

54\. (Objects) made of fruits, (if rubbed) with (a brush of) cow
hair, <span id="fr_153"></span>[54](#fn_153.md)

55\. Linen cloth, (if smeared) with a paste of yellow mustard (and
washed afterwards with water). <span id="fr_154"></span>[55](#fn_154.md)

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

56\. But land becomes pure, according to the degree of defilement, by
sweeping (the defiled spot), by smearing it with cowdung, by scraping
it, by sprinkling (water) or by heaping (pure earth) on (it). <span
id="fr_155"></span>[56](#fn_155.md)

57\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Land is purified by
these four methods, by digging, burning, scraping, being trodden on by
cows, and fifthly by being smeared with cowdung.' <span
id="fr_156"></span>[57](#fn_156.md)

58\. 'A woman is purified by her monthly discharge, a river by its
current, brass by (being scoured with) ashes, and an earthen pot by
another burning.' <span id="fr_157"></span>[58](#fn_157.md)

59\. 'But an earthen vessel which has been defiled by spirituous liquor,
urine, ordure, phlegm, pus, tears, or blood cannot be purified even by
another burning.'

60\. 'The body is purified by water, the internal organ by truth, the
soul by sacred learning and austerities, and the understanding by
knowledge.'

61\. Gold is purified by water alone, <span
id="fr_158"></span>[61](#fn_158.md)

62\. Likewise silver,

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

63\. Copper is cleansed by acids. <span id="fr_159"></span>[63](#fn_159.md)

64\. The Tîrtha sacred to the Gods lies at the root of the little
finger, <span id="fr_160"></span>[64](#fn_160.md)

65\. That sacred to the *Ri*shis in the middle of the fingers,

66\. That sacred to Men at the tips of the fingers,

67\. That sacred to Agni (fire) in the middle of the hand,

68\. That sacred to the Manes between the forefinger and the thumb.

69\. He shall honour (his food at) the evening and morning meals
(saying), 'It pleases me,' <span id="fr_161"></span>[69](#fn_161.md)

70\. At meals in honour of the Manes (saying), I have dined well,' <span
id="fr_162"></span>[70](#fn_162.md)

71\. At (a dinner given on the occasion of) rites procuring prosperity
(saying), 'It is perfect: <span id="fr_163"></span>[71](#fn_163.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_117"></span>[16:1](sbe1406.htm#fr_117.md) **III**. I read
*S*ûdrasadharmâ*n*a*h*, 'equal to *S*ûdras,' instead of
*s*ûdrakarmâ*n*a*h*, which occurs in MS. B. only. K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita
explains the latter reading by *s*ûdravatkarma yeshu te
*s*ûdravatteshvâ*k*ara*n*îyamityartha*h*, 'shall be treated like
*S*ûdras.' But the verses quoted in the following Sûtras show that the
former reading is the better one.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[16:2](sbe1406.htm#fr_118.md) Identical with Manu
II, 168.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[16:3](sbe1406.htm#fr_119.md) This and the
following nine verses are, as the word 'iti,' which the best MSS. give
at the end of Sûra 12, quotations. <span id="page_17">p. 17</span>
An*ri*k, 'who does not know the Veda,' means, literally, 'unacquainted
with the Rig-veda.'

<span id="fn_120"></span>[17:5](sbe1406.htm#fr_120.md) This verse, which is
identical with Manu XII, 114, and the next two are intended to show that
a Brâhma*n*a who, neglects the study of the Veda, is unfit to decide
points of the sacred law, which are not settled either by the Sm*ri*ti
or the *S*ruti, and become a member of a parishad or' Pa*ñk*.'

<span id="fn_121"></span>[17:6](sbe1406.htm#fr_121.md) The verse contains a
better version of Manu XII, 115.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[17:7](sbe1406.htm#fr_122.md) Regarding the term
Vedapâraga, see Gautama V, 20, note. Itareshâm, 'fools,' means
literally, 'different from (those who have mastered the Vedas).'

<span id="fn_123"></span>[18:9](sbe1406.htm#fr_123.md)-10. Regarding the
crime of 'neglecting a Brâhma*n*a,' see Manu VIII, 392-393, where fines
are prescribed for neglecting to invite to dinner worthy neighbours and
*S*rotriyas.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[18:10](sbe1406.htm#fr_124.md) A learned
Brâhma*n*a resembles a sacrificial fire, see e.g. below, XXX, 2-3;
Âpastamba I, 1, 3, 44.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[18:11](sbe1406.htm#fr_125.md) Manu II, 157.
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita and MS. B. give the ungrammatical construction
which occurs in Manu and other Dharma*s*âstras, while the other MSS.
read more correctly, 'ya*sk*a kâsh*th*amayo h. ya*sk*a *k*armamayo m.'
&c.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[18:13](sbe1406.htm#fr_126.md)-14. This rule
agrees exactly with Gautama X, 45; see also Vish*n*u III, 56-61. The
matter is introduced here in order to show the prerogative of a learned
Brâhma*n*a. Regarding the six lawful occupations, see-above, II, 13-14.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[19:15](sbe1406.htm#fr_127.md) Vish*n*u V,
189-192. The connexion of this subject with the main topic consists
therein that it furnishes an instance where learning does not protect a
Brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[19:17](sbe1406.htm#fr_128.md) I read with the
majority of the MSS., 'api vedântapâragam,' instead of 'vedântaga*m*
ra*n*e,' as K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita has.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[19:19](sbe1406.htm#fr_129.md) For the
explanations of the terms left untranslated, see the <span
id="page_20">p. 20</span> note on Âpastamba II, 8, 17, 22; Gautama XV,
28; and the notes on Vish*n*u LXXXIII, 2-21. Regarding the meaning of
*Kh*andoga, 'one who knows the first part of the Sâma-veda Sa*m*hitâ,'
see Weber, Hist. Ind. Lit., p. 63, note 59. 'One who knows the Sa*m*hitâ
and the Brâhma*n*a, i.e. of the Rig-veda.'--K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita.
Regarding the various classes of Snâtakas, see Âpastamba I, 11, 30, 1-3.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[20:20](sbe1406.htm#fr_130.md) Manu XII, 111.
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita reads *k*âturvidyas trikalpî *k*a, 'one who knows
the four Vedas and one who knows three different Kalpa-sûtras.' My
translation, follows the reading of the MSS., *k*âturvidya*m* vikalpî
*k*a, which is corroborated by the parallel passage of Baudhâyana I, 1,
8, '*k*âturvaidya*m* vikalpî *k*a.' The explanation of the latter word
is derived from Govindasvâmin. 'Men who are in three orders, i.e. a
student, a householder, and ascetic,' see Gautama XXVIII, 49.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[20:26](sbe1406.htm#fr_134.md)-34. Vish*n*u LXII,
1-9.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[21:30](sbe1406.htm#fr_135.md)
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita is probably right in thinking that the word vâ,
'or,' inserted before 'bending forward,' is intended to forbid other
improper acts, gestures or postures, which are reprehended in other
Sm*ri*tis.

This and the following two Sûtras are a quotation, as appears from the
use of the particle iti at the end of Sûtra 47.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[23:48](sbe1406.htm#fr_148.md) Gautama I, 42. For
the explanation of the term amedhya, 'unclean substances,' see Manu V,
135, and the passage from Devala translated in Professor Jolly's note on
Vish*n*u XXIII, 38.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[23:49](sbe1406.htm#fr_149.md) Gautama I, 29;

<span id="fn_153"></span>[23:54](sbe1406.htm#fr_153.md) Vish*n*u XXIII, 28.
Cups and bottles made of the shell of the cocoa-nut or of the Bilva
(Bel) fruit and of bottle-gourds are meant.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[23:55](sbe1406.htm#fr_154.md) Vish*n*u XXIII, 22.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[24:56](sbe1406.htm#fr_155.md) Vish*n*u XXIII,
56-57. K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita takes upa*k*ara*n*a, 'heaping (pure earth)
on (the defiled spot),' to mean 'lighting a fire on it' or 'digging it
up.' The translation given above rests on the parallel passages of
Gautama I, 32, and of Baudhâyana I, 5, 52, bhûmes tu
sa*m*mâr*g*anaproksha*n*opalepanâvastara*n*opalekhanairyathâsthâna*m*
doshavi*s*eshât prâyatyam, 'land becomes pure, according to the degree
of the defilement, by sweeping the (defiled) spot, by sprinkling it, by
smearing it with cowdung, by scattering (pure earth) on it, or by
scraping it.' Bhûmi, 'land,' includes also the mud-floor of a house or
of a verandah.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[24:57](sbe1406.htm#fr_156.md) Some MSS. have
instead of gharshât, 'by scraping,' varshât, 'by rain;' see also note on
Gautama I, 32.

which gold, silver, and copper have not been stained by impure
