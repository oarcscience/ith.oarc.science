### PRA*S*NA III, ADHYÂYA 2.

1\. As regards (the mode of subsistence called) Sha*nn*ivartanî, (that)
is (as follows):

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

2\. He cultivates six Nivartanas (of) fallow (land); he gives a share to
the owner (of the soil), or solicits his permission (to keep the whole
produce). <span id="fr_1340"></span>[2](#fn_1340.md)

3\. Let him plough before breakfast with two bulls whose noses have not
been pierced, not striking (them) with the goad, (but) frequently
coaxing (them). <span id="fr_1341"></span>[3](#fn_1341.md)

4\. If he cultivates six Nivartanas in this manner (and subsists
thereby), that is (the mode of living called) Sha*nn*ivartanî
(subsistence on six Nivartanas).

5\. (As regards the mode of subsistence called) Kauddâlî, he digs up
(the soil) near a water(-course or tank) with a spade, a ploughshare, or
a pointed piece of wood, sows seed, (and) grows bulbs, roots, fruit,
pot-herbs, and vegetables.

6\. (If he thus) cultivates (land) with a spade (and lives on its
produce), that is the (mode of life called) Kauddâlî (subsistence by the
spade). <span id="fr_1342"></span>[6](#fn_1342.md)

7\. He who lives by the (mode of subsistence called) Dhruvâ, wraps up
his head in a white dress (saying), 'For the sake of welfare I wrap thee
up, O head,' (and) takes the skin of a black antelope (with the words),
'(Thou art) spiritual pre-eminence, (I take thee) for the sake of
spiritual pre-eminence;' the Pavitra (reciting) the Abliṅga texts; the
water-pot (saying), 'Thou art strength, (I take) thee for <span
id="fr_1343"></span>[7](#fn_1343.md)

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

the sake of strength;' the yoke for carrying burdens (saying), 'Thou art
grain, (I take) thee for the sake of prosperity;' the staff (saying),
'(Thou art) a friend, protect me.'

8\. On leaving (his hut), he mutters the Vyâh*ri*tis, and (afterwards
the verse used for) hallowing the quarters of the horizon, 'May the
earth, the middle sphere, the sky, the constellations, and all the
quarters of the horizon, fire, air, and sun, (may all these) deities
protect me on my road.'

9\. Because, after muttering the Mânastokîya (text) and entering the
village, he shows himself with the yoke (on his shoulder) at the door of
each house, they call it 'showing oneself.'

10\. Because, if every (other) livelihood fails, he persistently
(dhruvam) supports himself by this (mode of living), it is called Dhruvâ
(the unchangeable). <span id="fr_1344"></span>[10](#fn_1344.md)

11\. (As regards the mode of life called) Samprakshâlanî, (if, in order
to show that) there is no waste of the vegetable (substances) obtained
nor <span id="fr_1345"></span>[11](#fn_1345.md)

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

any hoarding, he turns the dishes, after washing them, upside down,
(that is the livelihood called) Samprakshâlanî (living by washing).

12\. As to the (mode of subsistence called) Samûhâ, (if) he sweeps up
(grain) with a broom in permitted places where (grain-bearing) plants
are found, either on a road or in fields the access to which is not
obstructed (by hedges), and lives on (what he has thus obtained), that
(livelihood is called) Samûhâ (living by sweeping).

13\. As to the (mode of life called) Pâlanî, it is also named Ahi*m*sakâ
(not hurting), and the following (definition) is given. (If) he tries to
obtain from virtuous men husked rice or seeds, and maintains (himself)
thereby, that (is the mode of subsistence called) Pâlanî. <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[13](#fn_1346.md)

14\. As to the (mode of life called) Silo*ñkh*â, (if) he gleans single
ears in permitted places where (grain-bearing) plants grow, on a road or
in fields the access to which is not obstructed, and supports himself by
(these) gleanings, (collected) from time

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

to time, that (is the mode of subsistence called) Silo*ñkh*â (gleaning).

15\. As to the (livelihood called) Kapotâ, (if) he picks up with two
fingers single grains in permitted places, where (grain-bearing) plants
grow, either on the road or in fields the access to which is not
obstructed, that (is called), because he acts like a pigeon, Kapotâ
(pigeon-life). <span id="fr_1347"></span>[15](#fn_1347.md)

16\. As to (the mode of life called) Siddho*ñkh*â, (if) tired with the
(other) ways of subsistence, he asks, because he has become old or
diseased, virtuous men for cooked food, that (is the livelihood called)
Siddho*ñkh*â (gleaning cooked food). <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[16](#fn_1348.md)

17\. If (he adopts) the latter, he must reposit (the sacred fires) in
his soul and behave like an ascetic, except (in using) the cloth for
straining water and (wearing) a reddish-brown dress.

18\. If he subsists on the produce of the forest, (the fruits) of trees,
creepers. and lianas, and of grasses, such as wild millet (*s*yâmâka)
and wild sesamum, that (is called) forest-life.

19\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Moving about with the
beasts, dwelling together with them, and maintaining oneself in a manner
similar to theirs, that is clearly the road to heaven.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1340"></span>[288:2](sbe1474.htm#fr_1340.md) **2**. A
Nivartana is a measure of 4000 square hastas, the ancient equivalent of
the modern Bîghâ.

<span id="fn_1341"></span>[288:3](sbe1474.htm#fr_1341.md) Identical with
II, 2, 4, 21.

<span id="fn_1342"></span>[288:6](sbe1474.htm#fr_1342.md) Govinda says that
according to some the following ceremonies need only be performed when
one goes out begging for the first time, while others insist on their
being performed daily.

<span id="fn_1343"></span>[288:7](sbe1474.htm#fr_1343.md) The Mânastokîya,
i.e. the text beginning 'mâ nas toke,' <span id="page_289">p. 289</span>
occurs repeatedly in the Taittirîya-veda, e.g. Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ III, 4,
11, 2. Govinda adds that the beggar must remain silent, and rot stop
longer at each door than the time required for milking a cow.

<span id="fn_1344"></span>[289:10](sbe1474.htm#fr_1344.md) Both the text
and the scanty commentary on this Sûtra are corrupt. K. reads, v*ri*tter
v*ri*ttair avârtâyâ*m* tayaiva tasya dhruva*m* varttayatîti dhruveti
parikîrtitâ; D. v*ri*tte v*ri*ttair avârttâthâ, &c.; M. v*ri*tte
v*ri*tter av*ri*ttâyâm av*ri*ttâyâ*m* tathaiva tasyâ*h* ddh*ri*va*m*
varttamânâd iti, &c.; C. I. v*ri*tter v*ri*tter âvartâyâm âvartâyâm
tathaiva tasyâ*m* dhruva*m* vartanâd iti, &c. The Telugu copy omits the
text. From the commentary it is clear that Govinda read at the beginning
of the Sûtra v*ri*tter v*ri*tter,' and the Telugu copy proves that
'tayaiva' is the correct reading. I restore the Sûtra conjecturally; as
follows, v*ri*tter v*ri*tter avârttâyâ*m* tayaiva tasya dhruva*m*
vartanâd it dhruveti parikîrtitâ.

<span id="fn_1345"></span>[289:11](sbe1474.htm#fr_1345.md) 1 read,
samprakshâlanîti \| utpannânâm oshadhînâm prakshepa*n*a*m* <span
id="page_290">p. 290</span> nâstîti ni*k*ayo vâ bhâ*g*anâni
sa*m*prakshâlya nyub*g*ayatîti samprakshâlanî \|\| M. has nâsti ni*k*ayo
vâ, and C. I. reads also ni*k*ayo and omits 'vâ' The Dekhan MSS. have
nâstîti *k*ayo vâ. The description is not very clear; but it seems that
a person who lives by the Samprakshâlanî v*ri*tti must obtain grain and
vegetables by begging in such quantities as will suffice for one meal,
and prove by the way in which he treats his dishes that he has neither
wasted his food nor any store remaining.

<span id="fn_1346"></span>[290:13](sbe1474.htm#fr_1346.md) The translation
of this Satin is merely tentative, as the two MSS. of the commentary
omit the text, and contain only a fragment of Govinda's explanation. The
latter seems to have differed from my interpretation. The text, as given
by the other MSS., runs as follows: pâlanîty \[pâli°, MSS.\]
ahi*m*sakety evedam uktam bhavati \[°tîti, M.\] tushavihînâ*m*s
ta*nd*ulân i*kkh*ati sa*gg*anebhyo bîgâni vâ \[*k*â, D.\] pâlayatîti
pâlanî \[phâla°, phâlani, M.; pâlinô, K. D.\]

<span id="fn_1347"></span>[291:15](sbe1474.htm#fr_1347.md) Govinda mentions
a varia lectio not found in our MSS., kapotavatsa*m*da*ms*inî, 'because
he pecks like a pigeon.'

<span id="fn_1348"></span>[291:16](sbe1474.htm#fr_1348.md) Here as well as
above, III, 1, 7, the Dekhan MSS. read siddhe*kkh*â,' begging cooked
food,' instead of", siddho*ñkh*â.
