<p>3. Having had the hair on his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his nails, or his beard alone, cut, let him enter, dressed, in new clothes and speaking the truth, the place where the sacrificial fire is preserved.</p>

<p>13. (The ceremonies) beginning with the muttering (of sacred texts) and ending with the gift of a cow as a fee are known.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1380"></A><A HREF="#fn_1380"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>

<p>16. When he awakes (in the morning, the verse), 'O fire, thou art the protector of vows.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1383"></A><A HREF="#fn_1383"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>17. Let him not talk with women and <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras addressing them first; let him not look at urine and ordure.</p>  
<p>18. If he has seen any impure substance, he mutters (the text), 'Unrestrained (was) the internal organ, wretched my eye; the sun is the most&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1384"></A><A HREF="#fn_1384"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></p>

<p>excellent among the lights of heaven; O initiation, mayest thou not forsake me.'</p>  
<p>19. On the first day of the latter half (of the month he eats) fourteen mouthfuls.</p>  
<p>20. Thus (he takes every day) one (mouthful) less up to the day of the new moon.</p>  
<p>21. On the day of the new moon there is not (even) one mouthful (left to take).</p>  
<p>22. On the first day of the first half (of the month) one (mouthful may be eaten), on the second two.</p>  
<p>23. Thus he daily increases (his meal) by one (mouthful) up to the day of the full moon.</p>  
<p>24. On the day of the full moon he offers a Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka&nbsp; to Agni, to the lunar day whichever it may be, and to the lunar mansions as well as to their (guardian) deities.</p>  
<p>25. Having offered a burnt oblation to (the lunar mansion) Abhi<I>g</I>it (which stands) before <I>S</I>ro<I>n</I>&acirc;, and to its (guardian) deity, he must give a cow to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as.</p>

<p>27. A sinner who has performed either of these two (penances) becomes free from all mortal sins (p&acirc;taka).</p>  
<p>28. They declare that the (<I>K</I>&acirc;ndr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a) shall be performed for the sake of the fulfilment of wishes of all kinds.</p>

<p>31. 'He who studies this, becomes the companion of the lunar constellations, of sun and moon, and dwells in their world.'</p>
