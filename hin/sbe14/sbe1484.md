### PRA*S*NA IV, ADHYÂYA 2.

1\. We will separately explain the various penances for the several
offences, both heavier and lighter ones.

2\. Let him prescribe whatever may be befitting for each
(case),--heavier penances for great (crimes), and lighter ones for
trivial (faults).

3\. Let him perform the penances according to the rule given in the
Institutes of the Sacred Law.

4\. He who is about to accept gifts, or he who has accepted gifts, must
repeatedly recite the four *Ri*k-verses (called) Taratsamandîs. <span
id="fr_1415"></span>[4](#fn_1415)

5\. But in case one has eaten any kind of forbidden food; or that given
by a person whose food must not be eaten, the means of removing the
guilt is to sprinkle water (over one's head) while one recites the
Taratsamandî *Rik*as. <span id="fr_1416"></span>[5](#fn_1416)

6\. But we will, hereafter, declare another rule for (the expiation of)
the murder of a learned Brâhma*n*a, whereby (men) are freed also from
mortal sins of all (kinds).

7\. Let him (perform), during twelve nights, suppressions

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

of the breath (and) mutter purificatory texts, the Vyâh*ri*tis, the
syllable Om, (and) the Aghamarsha*n*a hymn, (living) on milk;

8\. Or (he becomes) pure if he bathes, and during three (days and)
nights subsists on air and (remains dressed) in wet clothes.

9\. But if he has repeatedly committed forbidden acts of all kinds, and
has (afterwards) worshipped reciting the Vâru*n*î (texts), he is freed
from all sin. <span id="fr_1417"></span>[9](#fn_1417)

10\. Now a student who has broken his vow (avakîr*n*in) shall heap fuel
on the fire on the night of the new moon, perform the preparatory
ceremonies required for a Darvîhoma, and offer two oblations of
clarified butter (reciting the following texts): 'O Lust, I have broken
my vow, my vow I have broken, O Lust, to. Lust Svâhâ;' 'O Lust, I have
done evil, I have done evil, O Lust, to Lust Svâhâ.' <span
id="fr_1418"></span>[10](#fn_1418)

11\. After he has made the offering, he shall address the fire, closely
joining his hands and turning sideways, (with the following texts): 'May
the Maruts grant me, may Indra, may B*ri*haspati,, may this fire grant
me long life and strength, make me long-lived.' The Maruts, forsooth,
give back to him the vital airs, Indra gives back to him strength,
B*ri*haspati the lustre of Brahman, Fire all the remainder. (Thus) his
body is made whole, and he attains the full length of life. Let him next
address (the gods) with three (repetitions of the texts).

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

\[paragraph continues\] For the gods are trebly true. (All that) has
been declared in the Veda.

12\. He who considers himself defiled by minor offences (upapâtaka),
will be freed from all guilt if he offers burnt oblations according to
this same rule; <span id="fr_1419"></span>[12](#fn_1419)

13\. Or if he has partaken of food unfit to be eaten or to be drunk or
of forbidden food, and if he has committed sinful acts or performed
sinful rites either unintentionally or intentionally, and if he has had
connexion with a female of the *S*ûdra caste or committed an unnatural
crime, he becomes pure by bathing (and reciting) the Abliṅga (verses)
and (those called) Vâru*n*îs. <span id="fr_1420"></span>[13](#fn_1420)

14\. Now they quote also (the following verse): If he has partaken of
food unfit to be eaten or to be drunk, or of forbidden food, and if he
has committed forbidden acts or performed forbidden rites, he will,
nevertheless, be freed from (crimes) committed intentionally which are
similar to mortal sins, nay, even from mortal sins (pâtaka).' <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[14](#fn_1421)

15\. Or let him fast during three (days and) nights, bathe thrice a day,
and, suppressing his breath, thrice recite the Aghamarsha*n*a. Manu has
declared that that is equal (in efficacy) to the final bath at a
horse-sacrifice. <span id="fr_1422"></span>[15](#fn_1422)

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

16\. And it is declared in the Veda, '(That is) the ancient purificatory
rite, which is widely known (in the Institutes of the Sacred Law);
purified thereby man conquers sin. May we, sanctified by this holy means
of purification, conquer our enemy, sin.'

The gift is, of course, one which ought not to be accepted.

<span id="fn_1416"></span>[317:5](sbe1484.htm#fr_1416) Rig-veda IX, 58.
Mâr*g*anam, literally 'rubbing,' means sprinkling the head with a
handful of water.--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1417"></span>[318:9](sbe1484.htm#fr_1417) 'Upasthâna,
"worshipping," i.e. sprinkling one's head with a handful of
water.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1418"></span>[318:10](sbe1484.htm#fr_1418) A repetition of
the rule given above, II, 1, I, 34; see also III, 4.

<span id="fn_1420"></span>[319:13](sbe1484.htm#fr_1420) Govinda gives,
like Haradatta on Gautama XXV, 7, as an instance of a doshavat karma, 'a
sinful rite,' the abhi*k*âra or 'magic rite in order to harm enemies.'
The expression has, however, in our Sûtra, a wider sense.

<span id="fn_1421"></span>[319:14](sbe1484.htm#fr_1421) I.e. if he
performs the penance prescribed in the preceding Sûtra.
