### PRA*S*NA IV, ADHYÂYA 7.

1\. The wishes of a Brâhma*n*a who has left off evil deeds and is (ever)
engaged in holy works are fulfilled even without (the practice of)
restraints. <span id="fr_1460"></span>[1](#fn_1460.md)

2\. Upright Brâhma*n*as quickly accomplish whatever

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

they wish in their hearts, if they are purified by honest actions.

3\. Thus a wise man should practise those restraints until he has
purified his bodily frame.

4\. He who has been purified by those restraints should, after fasting
three (days and) nights, begin the performance of that sacred rite
through which he wishes to gain the fulfilment of his desires,

5\. (Reciting) the Kshâpavitra, the Sahasrâksha, the M*ri*gâra, the two
*G*a*n*as (called) A*m*homu*k*, the Pâvamanîs, the Kûshmâ*nd*îs, and the
*Rik*as, addressed to Vai*s*vânara, <span

6\. (And) offering with (each of) these (Mantras) boiled rice and
clarified butter during seven days, in the morning, at midday, and in
the evening, keeping a rigid silence, living on food fit for a
sacrifice, restraining his senses and his actions,

7\. He is freed from all crimes, even mortal sins, after looking on a
cross-road at a pot filled with water, (and reciting the text), 'Si*m*he
me manyu*h*.'

8\. He is freed from the multitude of sins, committed unintentionally in
old age, in youth, and in infancy, and even from those belonging to
former births;

9\. After feeding at the end (of the seven days) Brâhma*n*as with milk
and rice, well. mixed with

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

butter, and distributing to them after their dinner cows, land, sesamum,
and gold,

10\. A Brâhma*n*a becomes internally pure, his guilt being consumed like
fuel, and fit for the performance of rites which secure the fulfilment
of wishes and of rites like the kindling of the sacred fire.
