### CHAPTER II.

1\. There are four castes (var*n*a), Brâhma*n*as, Kshatriyas, Vai*s*yas,
and *S*ûdras. <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89.md)

2\. Three castes, Brâhma*n*as, Kshatriyas, and Vai*s*yas, (are called)
twice-born.

3\. Their first birth is from their mother; the second from the
investiture with the sacred girdle. In that (second birth) the Sâvitrî
is the mother, but the teacher is said to be the father. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[3](#fn_90.md)

4\. They call the teacher father, because he gives instruction in the
Veda. <span id="fr_91"></span>[4](#fn_91.md)

5\. They quote also (the following passage from the Veda) to the same
(effect): 'Of two kinds, forsooth, is the virile energy of a man learned
in the Vedas, that which (resides) above the navel and the other which
below (the navel) descends down-wards. Through that which (resides)
above the navel, his offspring is produced, when he initiates
Brâhma*n*as, when he teaches them, when he causes them to offer
oblations, when he makes them holy. By that which resides below the
navel the children of his body are produced. Therefore they never say,
to a *S*rotriya, who teaches the Veda, "Thud art destitute of
offspring."' <span id="fr_92"></span>[5](#fn_92.md)

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

6\. Hârîta also quotes (the following verse): 'No religious rite can be
performed by a (child) before he has been girt with the sacred girdle,
since he is on a level with a *S*ûdra before his (new) birth from the
Veda.' <span id="fr_93"></span>[6](#fn_93.md)

7\. (The above prohibition refers to all rites) except those connected
with libations of water, (the exclamation) Svadhâ, and the manes. <span
id="fr_94"></span>[7](#fn_94.md)

8\. Sacred learning approached a Brâhma*n*a (and said to him), 'Preserve
me, I am thy treasure, reveal me not to a scorner, nor to a wicked man,
nor to one of uncontrolled passions: so (preserved) I shall become
strong.' <span id="fr_95"></span>[8](#fn_95.md)

9\. 'Reveal me, O Brâhma*n*a, as to the keeper of thy treasure, to him
whom thou shalt know to be pure, attentive, intelligent, and chaste, who
will not offend thee nor revile thee.'

10\. '(That man) who fills his ears with truth, who frees him from pain
and confers immortality upon him, (the pupil) shall consider as his
father and mother; him he must never grieve nor revile.' <span
id="fr_96"></span>[10](#fn_96.md)

11\. 'As those Brâhma*n*as who, after receiving instruction, do not
honour their teacher by their speech, in their hearts or by their acts,
will not be profitable to their teacher, even so that sacred learning
(which they acquired) will not profit them.'

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

12\. 'As fire consumes dry grass, even so the Veda, asked for, (but) not
honoured, (destroys the enquirer). Let him not proclaim the Veda to that
man, who does not show him honour according to his ability.'

13\. The (lawful) occupations of a Brâhma*n*a are six, <span
id="fr_97"></span>[13](#fn_97.md)

14\. Studying the Veda, teaching, sacrificing for himself, sacrificing
for. others, giving alms, and accepting gifts. <span
id="fr_98"></span>[14](#fn_98.md)

15\. (The lawful occupations) of a Kshatriya are three,

16\. Studying, sacrificing for himself, and bestowing gifts;

17\. And his peculiar duty is to protect the people with his weapons;
let him gain his livelihood thereby.

18\. (The lawful occupations) of a Vai*s*ya are the same (as those
mentioned above, Sûtra 16),

19\. Besides, agriculture, trading, tending cattle, and lending money at
interest,

20\. To serve those (superior castes) has been fixed as the means of
livelihood for a *S*ûdra. <span id="fr_99"></span>[20](#fn_99.md)

21\. (Men of) all (castes) may wear their hair arranged according to the
customs fixed (for their family), or allow it to hang down excepting the
lock on the crown of the head. <span id="fr_100"></span>[21](#fn_100.md)

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

22\. Those who are unable to live by their own lawful occupation may
adopt (that of) the next inferior (caste), <span
id="fr_101"></span>[22](#fn_101.md)

23\. But never (that of a) higher (caste).

24\. (A Brâhma*n*a and a Kshatriya) who have re-sorted to a Vai*s*ya's
mode of living, and maintain themselves by trade (shall not sell)
stones, salt, hempen (cloth), silk, linen (cloth), and skins, <span
id="fr_102"></span>[24](#fn_102.md)

25\. Nor any kind of dyed cloth,

26\. Nor prepared food, flowers, fruit, roots, per-fumes, substances
(used for) flavouring (food); nor water, the juice extracted from
plants; nor Soma, weapons, poison; nor flesh, nor milk, nor preparations
from it, iron, tin, lac, and lead, <span
id="fr_103"></span>[26](#fn_103.md)

27\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'By (selling) flesh,
lac, and salt a Brâhma*n*a at once becomes an outcast; by selling milk
he. becomes (equal to) a *S*ûdra after three days.' <span
id="fr_104"></span>[27](#fn_104.md)

28\. Among tame animals those with uncloven hoofs, and those that have
an abundance of hair, (must not be sold), nor any wild animals, (nor)
birds, nor beasts that have tusks (or fangs).

29\. Among the various kinds of grain they mention sesamum (as
forbidden). <span id="fr_105"></span>[29](#fn_105.md)

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

30\. Now they quote also (the following verse): If he applies sesamum to
any other purpose, but food, anointing, and charitable gifts, he will be
born again as a worm and, together with his ancestors, be plunged into
his own ordure.' <span id="fr_106"></span>[30](#fn_106.md)

31\. Or, at pleasure, they may sell (sesamum), if they themselves have
produced it by tillage. <span id="fr_107"></span>[31](#fn_107.md)

32\. For that purpose he shall plough before breakfast with two bulls
whose noses have not been pierced.

33\. (If he ploughs) in the hot season, he shall water (his beasts even
in the morning).

34\. The plough is attended by strong males, provided with a useful
share and with a handle (to be held) by the drinker of Soma; that raises
(for him) a cow, a sheep, a stout damsel, and a swift horse for the
chariot. <span id="fr_108"></span>[34](#fn_108.md)

35\. The plough is attended by strong males, i.e. is attended by strong
men and bullocks, provided with a useful share--for its share is useful
(because) with the share it raises, i.e. pierces deep--and provided with
a handle for the drinker of Soma,--for Soma reaches him,--possessing a
handle for him. That raises a cow, a sheep, goats, horses, mules,
donkeys and camels, and a stout damsel, i.e. a beautiful, useful maiden
in the flower of her youth.

36\. For how could the plough raise (anything for him) if he did not
sell grain?

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

37\. Substances used for flavouring may be bartered for (other)
substances of the same kind, be it for one more valuable or for one
worth less. <span id="fr_109"></span>[37](#fn_109.md)

38\. But salt must never (be exchanged) for (other) substances-used for
flavouring (food).

39\. It is permitted to barter sesamum, rice, cooked food, learning, and
slaves (each for its own kind and the one for the other).

40\. A Brâhma*n*a and a Kshatriya shall not lend (anything at interest
acting like) usurers. <span id="fr_110"></span>[40](#fn_110.md)

41\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'He who acquiring
property cheap, gives it for a high price, is called a usurer and blamed
among those who recite the Veda.'

42\. '(Brahman) weighed in the scales the crime of killing a learned
Brâhma*n*a against (the crime of) usury; the slayer of the Brâhma*n*a
remained at the top, the usurer sank downwards.'

43\. Or, at pleasure, they may lend to a person who entirely neglects
his sacred duties, and is exceedingly wicked, <span
id="fr_111"></span>[43](#fn_111.md)

44\. Gold (taking) double (its value on repayment, and) grain trebling
(the original price). <span id="fr_112"></span>[44](#fn_112.md)

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

45\. (The case of) flavouring substances has been explained by (the rule
regarding) grain,

46\. As well as (the case of) flowers, roots, and fruit.

47\. (They may lend) what is sold by weight, (taking) eight times (the
original value on repayment). <span id="fr_113"></span>[47](#fn_113.md)

48\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Two in the hundred,
three and four and five, as has teen declared in the Sm*ri*ti, he may
take as interest by the month according to the order of the
castes.' <span id="fr_114"></span>[48](#fn_114.md)

49\. 'But the king's death shall stop the interest on money
(lent);' <span id="fr_115"></span>[49](#fn_115.md)

50\. 'And after the coronation of (a new) king the capital grows again.'

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

51\. 'Hear the interest for a money-lender declared by the words of
Vasish*th*a, five mash's for twenty (kârshâpa*n*as may be taken every
month); thus the law is not violated.' <span
id="fr_116"></span>[51](#fn_116.md)

<span id="fn_92"></span>[9:5](sbe1405.htm#fr_92.md) The reading
tathâpyudâharanti, which several of my MSS. give, seems to me preferable
to K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita's udâharati. K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita explains sâdhu
karoti, 'makes them holy,' by adhyâtmam upadi*s*ati,' teaches them
transcendental knowledge.'

<span id="fn_93"></span>[10:6](sbe1405.htm#fr_93.md) Vish*n*u XXVIII, 40.
Instead of K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita's 'yâvadvedo na *g*âyate,' 'yâvadvede na
*g*âyate,' which occurs in several MSS. and in the parallel passages of
Manu II, 172 and other Sm*ri*tis, must be read.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[10:7](sbe1405.htm#fr_94.md) Gautama II, 5. The
rites referred to are the funeral rites.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[11:13](sbe1405.htm#fr_97.md) K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita
wrongly connects the word brâhma*n*asya with the next Sûtra. For this
and the next seven Sûtras, compare Vish*n*u II, 4-14.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[11:14](sbe1405.htm#fr_98.md) K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita
by mistake leaves out the word 'dânam.'

<span id="fn_99"></span>[11:20](sbe1405.htm#fr_99.md) I read 'teshâm
pari*k*aryâ,' with the majority of the MSS., instead of
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita's 'teshâ*m* *k*a pari*k*aryâ.'

<span id="fn_100"></span>[11:21](sbe1405.htm#fr_100.md) In illustration of
this Sûtra K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita quotes a verse of Laugâkshi, which
states that Brâhma*n*as belonging to the Vasish*th*a family wore the
top-lock on the right side of the head, and the members of the Atri
family allowed it to hang down on <span id="page_12">p. 12</span> both
sides, while the Bh*ri*gus shaved their heads, and the Âṅgirasas wore
five locks (*k*û*d*â) on the crown of the head. Cf. Max Müller, Hist.
Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 53.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[12:22](sbe1405.htm#fr_101.md) Vish*n*u II, 15.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[12:24](sbe1405.htm#fr_102.md) For this and the
following four Sûtras, see Gautama VII, 8-21.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[12:26](sbe1405.htm#fr_103.md) Rasâ*h*,
'substances used for flavouring,' i.e. 'molasses, sugar-cane, sugar, and
the like.'--K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita. See also note on Gautama VII, 9.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[12:27](sbe1405.htm#fr_104.md) Identical with Manu
X, 92.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[12:29](sbe1405.htm#fr_105.md) Vish*n*u LIV, 18;
Âpastamba I, 7, 20, 13. K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita wrongly connects this Sûtra
with the preceding one.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[13:30](sbe1405.htm#fr_106.md) Manu X, 91.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[13:31](sbe1405.htm#fr_107.md) Manu X, 90.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[13:34](sbe1405.htm#fr_108.md)
Vâ*g*asaneyi-sa*m*hitâ XII, 71. The translation follows the explanation
given in the next Sûtra as closely as possible, though the latter is
without doubt erroneous. The purpose for which Vasish*th*a introduces
it, is to show that a Vedic text permits agriculture to a Brâhma*n*a who
offers Soma-sacrifices.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[14:37](sbe1405.htm#fr_109.md)-39. Gautama VII,
16-21.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[14:40](sbe1405.htm#fr_110.md) Manu X, 117.
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita reads with MS. B., vârdhushi*m* na dadyâtâm, and
explains it by v*ri*ddhi*m* naiva prayo*g*ayetâm, 'they shall not take
interest.' I read with the other MSS. vârdhushî, and translate that term
by 'usurers.' Below, Sûtra 42, vârdhushi is used likewise in this its
usual sense.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[14:43](sbe1405.htm#fr_111.md) Manu X, 117.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[14:44](sbe1405.htm#fr_112.md)-47. Vish*n*u VI,
11-17; Colebrooke I, Dig. LXVI, where 'silver and gems' have been added
after gold, and rasâ*h*, 'flavouring substances,' been translated by
'fluids.' The translation differs also in other respects, because there
the Sûtras stand by themselves, while here the nouns in Sûtras 44 and 47
are governed by the preceding dadyâtâm, 'they may lend.' They, i.e. a
Brâhma*n*a <span id="page_15">p. 15</span> and a Kshatriya. The rule, of
course, refers to other castes also, and to those cases where no
periodical interest is taken, but the loan returned in kind.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[15:47](sbe1405.htm#fr_113.md) The Ratnâkara
quoted by Colebrooke loc. cit. takes 'what is sold by weight' to be
'camphor and the like.' K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita thinks that 'clarified
butter, honey, spirituous liquor, oil, molasses, and salt' are meant.
But most of these substances fall under the term rasâ*h*, 'flavouring
substances.' The proper explanation of the words seems to be, 'any other
substance not included among those mentioned previously, which is sold
by weight.'

<span id="fn_114"></span>[15:48](sbe1405.htm#fr_114.md) Vish*n*u VI, 2, and
especially Manu VIII, 142. The lowest rate of interest is to be taken
from the highest caste, and it becomes greater with decreasing
respectability. According to K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita and the commentators
on the parallel passage of Vish*n*u, Manu, and other Sm*ri*tis, this
rule applies only to loans for which no security is given--a statement
which is doubtlessly correct.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[15:49](sbe1405.htm#fr_115.md)-50. Both the
reading and the sense of this verse, which in some MSS. is wanting, are
somewhat doubtful. I read with my best MSS.,

râ*g*â to m*ri*tabhâvena dravyav*ri*ddhi*m* vinâ*s*ayet \|  
punâ râ*g*âbhisheke*n*a dravyamûla*m* *k*a vardhate \|\|

and consider that it gives a rule, ordering all money transactions to be
stopped during the period which intervenes between the death of a king
and the coronation of his successor. I am, however, unable to point out
any parallel passages confirming this <span id="page_16">p. 16</span>
view. K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita's text shows two important various readings,
'bh*ri*tibhâvena' and 'râ*g*âbhîshikena,' which I think are merely
conjectures, unsupported by the authority of MSS. He explains the verse
as follows: 'The king shall destroy, i.e. himself not take, the interest
on money by giving \[it away\] as a salary. But, after thus giving away
interest received, he may increase his capital by \[an extra tax imposed
on\] the cultivators, i.e. take from them the highest rate, consisting
of one-fourth of the produce.'

<span id="fn_116"></span>[16:51](sbe1405.htm#fr_116.md) Gautama XII, 29;
Colebrooke I, Dig. XXIV. The rule given in this Sûtra refers, as
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita correctly states, to loans, for which security is
given. The rate is 1¼ per cent for the month, or 15 per annum; see the
note to Gautama loc. cit. Manu, VIII, 140, especially mentions that this
rate is prescribed by Vasish*th*a.
