### PRA*S*NA III, ADHYÂYA 7.

1\. 'Let him who considers himself impure offer (burnt oblations),
reciting the Kûshmâ*nd*as.' <span id="fr_1364"></span>[1](#fn_1364.md)

2, 'He who has had forbidden intercourse, or has committed a crime
against nature, becomes even like a thief, even like the slayer of a
learned Brâhma*n*a.'

3\. 'He is freed from any sin which is less than the crime of slaying a
learned Brâhma*n*a.'

4\. If, after wasting his strength except in his sleep, he desires to
become free from the stain and holy,

5\. He causes the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and
his nails to be cut on the day of the new moon or of the full moon, and
takes upon himself a vow according to the rule prescribed for students,

6\. (To be kept) during a year, or a month, or twenty-four days, or
twelve nights, or six or three nights. <span

7\. Let him not eat meat, nor approach a woman, not sit on (a couch or
seat, and) beware of (speaking an) untruth. <span
id="fr_1366"></span>[7](#fn_1366.md)

8\. To subsist on milk (alone is) the most excellent mode of living; or,
using barley-gruel (as his food), he may perform a K*rikkh*ra (penance)
of twelve days, or he may (maintain himself by) begging. <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[8](#fn_1367.md)

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

9\. On such (occasions) a Kshatriya (shall subsist on) barley-gruel, a
Vai*s*ya on curds of two-milk whey.

10\. Having kindled the sacred fire in the morning according to the rule
for Pâkaya*gñ*as, having scattered (Ku*s*a grass) around it, and having
performed (the preliminary ceremonies) up to the end of the Agnimukha,
he next offers in addition burnt oblations, reciting the three Anuvâkas
(beginning), 'What cause of anger to the gods, ye gods,' 'The debts
which I contracted,' (and) 'May worshipful Agni give thee by every means
long life.' <span id="fr_1368"></span>[10](#fn_1368.md)

11\. Let him offer with each *Ri*k-verse a portion of clarified butter.

12\. After having offered four oblations with (the spoon called) Sruva,
reciting (the texts), 'That strength which lies in the lion, in the
tiger, and in the panther,' &c., and the four Abhyâvartinîs (i.e. the
texts), 'Thou, O fire, who turnest back,' &c., 'O Aṅgiras,' &c., 'Again
with strength,' &c., (and) 'With wealth,' &c., after having taken his
position, with sacred fuel in his hands, in the place allotted to the
sacrificer, he worships (the fire) with the hymn which contains twelve
verses (and begins), 'To Vai*s*vânara we announce.' <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[12](#fn_1369.md)

13\. Having placed the piece of sacred fuel (on the fire with the text),
'Whatever sin I ever committed <span id="fr_1370"></span>[13](#fn_1370.md)

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

by thoughts or words, from all that free me (O fire, being duly)
praised, for thou knowest the truth, Svâhâ,' he gives a fee.

14\. (The ceremonies) which begin with the muttering (of the texts) and
end with the gift of a cow as a fee are known.

15\. One (person) only (shall) perform the service of the fire.

16\. Now (let him offer) at the Agnyâdheya full oblations (pûr*n*âhuti,
with the texts), 'Whatever cause of anger to the gods, ye gods;' 'The
debts which I contracted;" May worshipful Agni give thee by every means
long life.' <span id="fr_1371"></span>[16](#fn_1371.md)

17\. Having offered (it), he who is about to perform the Agnihotra,
(worships) with the Da*s*ahot*ri* (texts); having offered (it), he who
is about to perform the new and full moon sacrifices (worships) with the
*K*aturhot*ri* (texts); having offered (it), he who is about to offer
the *K*âturmâsya sacrifices (worships) with the Pa*ñk*ahot*ri* (texts);
having offered it, (he worships) at an animal sacrifice with the
Sha*ddh*ot*ri* (texts), at a Soma-sacrifice with the Saptahot*ri*
(texts). <span id="fr_1372"></span>[17](#fn_1372.md)

18\. And it is declared in the Veda, 'Let him sacrifice (with the
Kûshmâ*nd*a texts) at the beginning of the rites; purified (thereby) he
gains the world of the gods.' Thus (speaks) the Brâhma*n*a. <span
