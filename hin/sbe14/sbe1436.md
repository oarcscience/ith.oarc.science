### PRA*S*NA I, ADHYÂYA 2, KA*ND*IKÂ 3.

2\. (Or) twenty-four (years), or twelve for each Veda, <span

4\. Or until (the Veda has been) learned; for life is uncertain. <span
id="fr_758"></span>[4](#fn_758)

5\. A passage of the revealed texts declares, 'Let him kindle the sacred
fires while his hair is (still) black.' <span

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

6\. They do not put any (religious) restrictions on the acts of a
(child) before the investiture with the girdle (is performed). For he is
on a level with a *S*ûdra before (his second) birth through the
Veda. <span id="fr_760"></span>[6](#fn_760)

7\. The number of years (must be calculated) from the conception. Let
him initiate a Brâhma*n*a in the eighth (year) after that, <span

8\. A Kshatriya three (years) later (than a Brâhma*n*a),

9\. A Vai*s*ya one year later than a (Kshatriya).

11\. (Let him perform the initiation reciting), according to the order
(of the castes), a Gâyatrî, a Trish*t*ubh, (or) a *G*agatî (verse).

12\. Up to the sixteenth, the twenty-second, and the twenty-fourth
(years) respectively (the time for the initiation) has not passed. <span

13\. The girdles (shall consist of a rope) made of Mu*ñg*a grass, a
bow-string, (or a rope) made of hemp. <span

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

16\. Let him beg, (employing a formula) consisting of seven syllables,
with the word bhavat in the beginning, with the word bhikshâ in the
middle, and with the (verb expressing) the request at the end; and let
him not pronounce loudly (the syllables) kshâ and hi. <span
id="fr_767"></span>[16](#fn_767)

17\. A Brâhma*n*a (student) shall ask for alms, placing (the word)
'Lady' first, a Kshatriya placing <span id="fr_768"></span>[17](#fn_768)

it in the middle, (and) a Vai*s*ya placing it at the end (of the

18\. The (persons fit to be asked) are Brâhma*n*as and so forth, who
follow (their lawful) occupations.

sacred fire). <span id="fr_769"></span>[19](#fn_769)

20\. (A student shall be) truthful, modest, and devoid of pride. <span
id="fr_770"></span>[20](#fn_770)

21\. He shall rise before (his teacher in the morning) and go to rest
after (him in the evening). <span id="fr_771"></span>[21](#fn_771)

22\. He shall never disobey the words of his teacher except (when he is
ordered to commit) a crime causing loss of caste. <span
id="fr_772"></span>[22](#fn_772)

23\. Let him converse with women so much (only) as his purpose
requires. <span id="fr_773"></span>[23](#fn_773)

24\. Let him avoid dancing, singing, playing musical instruments, the

his eyes), and anointing (his body). <span
id="fr_774"></span>[24](#fn_774)

25\. Let him take hold (of his teacher's) right (foot) with the right
(hand), and of the left (foot) with the left hand. <span
id="fr_775"></span>[25](#fn_775)

26\. If he desires long life and (bliss in) heaven, <span
id="fr_776"></span>[26](#fn_776)

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

(he may act) at his pleasure (in the same manner) towards other holy
(men), after having received permission from his teacher.

27\. (Let him say), 'I N. N., ho! (salute thee),' touching his ears, in
order to compose the internal organ. <span

feet. <span id="fr_778"></span>[28](#fn_778)

29\. (A student shall not embrace his teacher) when he (himself) is
seated, or lying down, or impure, nor when (his teacher) is seated,
lying down, or impure. <span id="fr_779"></span>[29](#fn_779)

30\. If he can (find water to sip), he shall not remain impure even
during a muhûrta. <span id="fr_780"></span>[30](#fn_780)

31\. If he carries a load of fuel or holds a pot, flowers, or food in
his hands, he shall not salute; nor (shall he do it) on similar
occasions. <span id="fr_781"></span>[31](#fn_781)

32\. Let him not salute (the teacher) standing too close,

33\. Nor, if he has reached the age of puberty, the young wives of
brothers and the young wives of the teacher. <span
id="fr_782"></span>[33](#fn_782)

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

34\. To sit together with (these persons) in a boat, on a rock, on a
plank, on an elephant, on the roof of a house, on a mat, or in wheeled
vehicles is permissible. <span id="fr_783"></span>[34](#fn_783)

35\. (The pupil) must assist his teacher in making his toilet, shampoo
him, attend him while bathing, eat his leavings, and so forth. <span
id="fr_784"></span>[35](#fn_784)

36\. (But he) should avoid the remnants of food left by his (teacher's)
son, though he may know the Veda together with the Aṅgas, <span
id="fr_785"></span>[36](#fn_785)

37\. And to assist at the toilet of, to shampoo, to attend in the bath,
and to eat the remnants of food left by a young wife of his (teacher).

38\. Let him run after (his teacher) when he runs, walk after him when
he walks, attend him standing when he stands. <span
id="fr_786"></span>[38](#fn_786)

39\. Let him not sport in the water while bathing. <span
id="fr_787"></span>[39](#fn_787)

40\. Let him swim (motionless) like a stick.

41\. To study under a non-Brâhmanical teacher (is permitted) in times of
distress. <span id="fr_788"></span>[41](#fn_788)

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

42\. (The pupil shall) obey and walk after him as long as the
instruction (lasts). <span id="fr_789"></span>[42](#fn_789)

43\. (According to some this is improper, because) just that (mutual
relation) sanctifies both of them. <span
id="fr_790"></span>[43](#fn_790)

44\. And (the behaviour) towards brothers, sons, and (other) pupils (of
the teacher shall be regulated) in the same manner. <span

46\. Kâtya (declares that) the salutation shall be returned. <span
id="fr_793"></span>[46](#fn_793)

47\. For (the propriety of that rule) is apparent (from the story) about
*S*i*s*u Âṅgirasa. <span id="fr_794"></span>[47](#fn_794)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_755"></span>[149:1](sbe1436.htm#fr_755) **3**. Âpastamba I,
1, 2, 12. Govindasvâmin gives four explanations of the adjective
paurâ*n*am, 'kept by the ancients,' viz. 1. old, i.e. kept by the men of
the K*ri*ta or Golden age; 2. revealed to and kept by the ancients, such
as Manu; 3. found in the ancient, i.e. eternal Veda; 4. found in the
known Itihâsas and Purâ*n*as.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[149:2](sbe1436.htm#fr_756) Âpastamba I, 1, 2,
14-16.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[149:3](sbe1436.htm#fr_757) Each Kâ*nd*a, i.e.
each of the seven books of the Taittirîya-sa*m*hitâ.

<span id="fn_758"></span>[149:4](sbe1436.htm#fr_758) Manu III, 1.

<span id="fn_759"></span>[149:5](sbe1436.htm#fr_759) The object of the
Sûtra is to prove that the period of studentship must not be protracted
too long, lest the duty of offering the *S*rauta Agnihotra be neglected.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[150:6](sbe1436.htm#fr_760) Vasish*th*a II, 6;
Gautama II, 1.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[150:7](sbe1436.htm#fr_761)-9. Vasish*th*a XI,
49-51.

<span id="fn_762"></span>[150:10](sbe1436.htm#fr_762) Âpastamba I, 1, 1,
18.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[150:12](sbe1436.htm#fr_763) Vasish*th*a XI,
71-73.

<span id="fn_764"></span>[150:13](sbe1436.htm#fr_764) Vasish*th*a XI,
58-60. With this and the next two Sûtras the words 'according to the
order of the castes' must be understood.

<span id="fn_765"></span>[150:14](sbe1436.htm#fr_765) Vasish*th*a XI,
61-63.

<span id="fn_766"></span>[150:15](sbe1436.htm#fr_766) Vasish*th*a XI,
55-57. The details referred to are to be <span id="page_151">p.
151</span> found in the Baudhâyana G*ri*hya-sûtra II, 7, where the
various kinds of trees from which the staff may be taken are specified.
The Sûtra shows that the G*ri*hya-sûtra preceded the Dharma-sûtra in the
collection.

<span id="fn_767"></span>[151:16](sbe1436.htm#fr_767) The text of this
Sûtra is corrupt. I read, 'bhavatpurvâ*m* bhikshâmadhyâ*m* yâ*kñ*ântâ*m*
*k*aret saptâksharâ*m* bhikshâ*m* kshâ*m* *k*a hi*m* *k*a na vardhayet'
The various readings of the MSS. are, bhikshâ*m* madhyâ*m*
ya*kkh*â*m*tâ*m* *k*aret saptâksharâ*m* bhim *k*a na vardhayet, C.
T.;--yâ*kñ*â*m*tâ*m* *k*aret saptâkshara*mn*i kshâ*m* *k*a bhim *k*a
narvyayet, D.;-- yâ*kñ*â*m*tâ*m* *k*aret saptâksharâ*m*sti*m* rkshâ ba
hi*m* na vardhayet, K.; yâ*kñ*â*m*tâ*m* tikshâ*m* *k*aret saptâksharân
kshâ*m* *k*a hi*m* *k*a na vardhayan, M.; yâ*k*anâ*sk*â*m*tâ*m* *k*aret
saptâksharân bhikshâ*m* ka him ka na vardhayet, C. I. The most serious
corruption lies in the syllables following saptâksharâ*m*, and I am not
certain that my emendation bhikshâ*m* is correct. The commentary on the
first half of the Sûtra runs as follows: bhikshâmantra*m* vyaktam
evo*kk*aret bhava*kkh*abdapûrvâm bhikshâ*s*abdamadhyâ*m*
yâ*kñ*âpratipa\[pâ\]daka*s*abdâ*m*tâ*m* *s*abdâksharâ*m*
\[saptâksharâ*m*\] *k*a eva*m* hi bhavati bhikshâ*m* dehi sa*m*panno
bhavati, 'let him pronounce distinctly the formula employed in begging,
beginning with the word bhavat, having the word bhikshâ in the middle,
and ending with the word conveying the sense of giving, and containing
seven syllables. For thus (the formula), "Lady, give alms," becomes
complete.' It is curious that Govinda says nothing about the form
saptâksharâm and the feminine terminations of the other adjectives,
which do not agree with mantram, a masculine.

<span id="fn_768"></span>[151:17](sbe1436.htm#fr_768) Vasish*th*a XI,
68-70; Gautama II, 35. Govinda thinks that a student should, if
possible, beg from people of his own caste. Three castes only are
intended by the term 'from all castes.' But see Âpastamba I, 1, 3, 25;
Gautama VII, 1 seqq.

<span id="fn_769"></span>[152:19](sbe1436.htm#fr_769) Vish*n*u XXVIII,
4.

<span id="fn_770"></span>[152:20](sbe1436.htm#fr_770) Gautama II, 8;
Âpastamba I, 1, 3, 20.

<span id="fn_771"></span>[152:21](sbe1436.htm#fr_771) Vish*n*u XXVIII,
13.

<span id="fn_772"></span>[152:22](sbe1436.htm#fr_772) Âpastamba I, 1, 2,
19; Vasish*th*a VII, 10.

<span id="fn_773"></span>[152:23](sbe1436.htm#fr_773) Âpastamba I, 1, 3,
16.

<span id="fn_774"></span>[152:24](sbe1436.htm#fr_774) Vish*n*u XXVIII,
11; Vasish*th*a VII, 15.

<span id="fn_775"></span>[152:25](sbe1436.htm#fr_775) Vish*n*u XXVIII,
15. The details regarding the times when this kind of salutation is to
be performed are found Âpastamba I, 2, 5, 21 seqq.

<span id="fn_776"></span>[152:26](sbe1436.htm#fr_776) The two copies of
the commentary connect the clause, 'if he is desirous of long life and
(bliss in) heaven,' with the preceding Sûtra. But see Âpastamba I, 2, 5,
15, where the identical words <span id="page_153">p. 153</span> occur.
The commentary omits the remainder of the Sûtra, which all my MSS. give
here, and inserts it below, after Sûtra 29.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[153:27](sbe1436.htm#fr_777) Âpastamba I, 2, 5,
12; Vasish*th*a XIII. 44. Regarding the phrase,' in order to compose his
internal organ,' see Manu II, 120.

<span id="fn_778"></span>[153:28](sbe1436.htm#fr_778) Âpastamba I, 2, 5,
22. The meaning seems to be that the pupil is first to stroke his
teacher's legs from the knee downwards, and then to take hold of it at
the ankle.

<span id="fn_779"></span>[153:29](sbe1436.htm#fr_779) Âpastamba I, 4,
14, 14-20.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[153:30](sbe1436.htm#fr_780) Âpastamba I, 5,
15, 8.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[153:31](sbe1436.htm#fr_781) Âpastamba I, 4,
14, 22. 'On similar occasions,' i.e. when he himself is engaged in the
worship of the manes, of the gods, or of the fire, or when his teacher
is occupied in that way.

<span id="fn_782"></span>[153:33](sbe1436.htm#fr_782) The salutation
which is meant, is probably the embrace of the feet; see also Gautama
II, 32. Govinda thinks that the words samavâye 'tyantya*s*a*h*,
'standing too close,' must be understood.

<span id="fn_783"></span>[154:34](sbe1436.htm#fr_783) Govinda adds that
to sit with young wives of his teachers on other occasions is sinful.

<span id="fn_784"></span>[154:35](sbe1436.htm#fr_784) I read utsâdana,
'to shampoo,' while the MSS. have either a lacuna or read u*kkh*âdana,
and the commentary â*kkh*âdana, which is explained by
*kh*attradhâra*n*a, 'to hold a parasol,' or malâpakarsha*n*a, 'to
clean.' The *kkh*a is, however, merely owing to a very common faulty
pronunciation of tsa. Govinda remarks correctly that the word 'iti,'
which follows the enumeration of the services to be performed by the
pupil, has the force of 'and so forth.'

<span id="fn_785"></span>[154:36](sbe1436.htm#fr_785)-37. The meaning of
the two Sûtras is that the pupil shall serve the son of his teacher,
especially if he is learned, and aged wives of his teacher, but not eat
their leavings. The explanation of anû*k*âna, 'who knows the Aṅgas,' is
given by Baudhâyana, G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 11, 4.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[154:38](sbe1436.htm#fr_786) Âpastamba I, 2, 6,
7-9; Vasish*th*a VII, 12.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[154:39](sbe1436.htm#fr_787)-40. Âpastamba I,
1, 2, 30; Vish*n*u XXVIII, 5.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[154:41](sbe1436.htm#fr_788) Âpastamba II, 2,
4, 25. Govinda combines this Sûtra with the next two and makes one of
the three.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[155:42](sbe1436.htm#fr_789) Âpastamba II, 2,
4, 26; Gautama VII, 2-3.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[155:43](sbe1436.htm#fr_790) The words between
brackets belong to Govinda.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[155:44](sbe1436.htm#fr_791) I.e. if they are
younger than oneself.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[155:45](sbe1436.htm#fr_792) Instead of
pratyutthâyâbhibhâsha*n*am, '(shall be honoured by) rising and being
addressed,' which is the reading of the two copies of the commentary and
of M., the MSS. from the Dekhan and Gu*g*arât read,
pratyutthâyâbhivâdanam. The latter reading might be translated by 'shall
be saluted by rising;' see Gautama VI, 9. Govinda says, in explanation
of this rule: 'This restrictive rule also (refers) to teachers only,
officiating priests, and the rest; to address (means) to use words such
as "we come."

<span id="fn_793"></span>[155:46](sbe1436.htm#fr_793) 'Kâtya, i.e. a
descendant of the *Ri*shi Kata. He was of opinion that officiating
priests and the rest must return the salute. As the return of a salute
is prescribed for them, it is understood that the other (party) must
salute.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_794"></span>[155:47](sbe1436.htm#fr_794) The story of
*S*i*s*u Âṅgirasa is told, Manu II, 151-153.
