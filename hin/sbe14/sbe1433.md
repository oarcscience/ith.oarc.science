### CHAPTER XXX.

1\. Practise righteousness, not unrighteousness; speak truth, not
untruth; look far, not near; look towards the Highest, not towards that
which is not the Highest.

2\. A Brâhma*n*a is a fire. <span id="fr_724"></span>[2](#fn_724)

3\. For the Veda (says), 'Agni, forsooth, is a Brâhma*n*a.' <span
id="fr_725"></span>[3](#fn_725)

4\. And how is that?

5\. And it is also declared in the Kâ*th*aka, 'On that (occasion) the
body of the Brâhma*n*a who represents the sacrificial seat is the altar,
the vow to perform the rite is the sacrifice, the soul is the animal to
be slain, the intellect the rope (with which the animal is bound), the
mouth of (the Brâhma*n*a) who represents the seat is the Âhavanîya fire,
in his navel (is the Dakshi*n*â fire), the fire in his abdomen is the
Gârhapatya fire, the Prâ*n*a is the Adhvaryu priest, the Apâna, the
Hot*ri* priest, the Vyâna the Brahman, the Samâna the Udgât*ri* priest,
the organs of sensation the sacrificial vessels. He who knowing this
offers a sacrifice to the organs through the organs.' . . . <span
id="fr_726"></span>[5](#fn_726)

6\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'An offering placed in
the mouth-fire of a Brâhma*n*a

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

which is rich in Veda-fuel, protects and saves the giver and (the eater)
himself from sin.'

7\. 'But the offering made through the mouth of a Brâhma*n*a, which is
neither spilt nor causes pain (to sentient creatures), nor assails him
(who makes it), is far more excellent than an Agnihotra.' <span
id="fr_727"></span>[7](#fn_727)

8\. After performing a mental sacrifice at which meditation (takes the
place of the sacred) fire, truthfulness (the place of) the sacred fuel,
patience (the place of) the oblation, modesty (the place of) the
sacrificial spoon, abstention from injuring living beings (the place of
the) sacrificial cake, contentment (the place of) the sacrificial post,
(and a promise of) safety given to all beings which is hard to keep (the
place of) the reward given to the priests, a wise man goes to his
(eternal) home. <span id="fr_728"></span>[8](#fn_728)

9\. The hair of an aging man shows signs of age, (and) the teeth of an
aging man show signs of age, (but) the desire to live and the desire for
wealth do not decay even in an aging man.

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

10\. Happiness (is the portion) of that man who relinquishes (all)
desire, which fools give up with difficulty, which does not diminish
with age, and which is a life-long disease.

11\. Adoration to Vasish*th*a Satayâtu, the son of Mitra and Varu*n*a
and Urva*s*î!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_724"></span>[138:2](sbe1433.htm#fr_724) **XXX**. See above,
III, 10.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[138:3](sbe1433.htm#fr_725)
*S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a I, 4, 22.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[138:5](sbe1433.htm#fr_726)
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita divides the passage into thirteen Sûtras, and
connects tatra, 'on that occasion,' with the preceding Sûtra. 'On that
(occasion),' i.e. if a Brâhma*n*a is fed.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[139:7](sbe1433.htm#fr_727) Manu VII, 84;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 315. K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita's reading, nainam adhyâ*k*ate
ka ya*h*, which occurs also in B., is nonsense. I read with Bh.
nainamadhyâpate*kk*a yat, and take adhyâpatet, 'assails (the giver),' in
the sense of 'troubles him by causing the performance of penances, on
account of mistakes committed.' Manu's version, na vina*s*yati
karhi*k*it, 'and never perishes,' is of course an easier one, but it
seems to me doubtful whether it is older than Vasish*th*a's.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[139:8](sbe1433.htm#fr_728) The passage, which
is probably a quotation from an Upanishad, is very corrupt in the MSS.
and K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita's text. I correct it as follows:

Dhyânâgni*h* satyopa*k*ayana*m* kshântyâhuti*h*  
sruva*m*hrî*h* puro*d*âsamahi*m*sâ sa*m*tosho  
yûpa*h* k*rikkh*ra*m* bhûtebhyo ’bhayadâkshi*n*yam iti  
k*ri*tvâ kratum mânasa*m* yâti kshayam budha*h*.

\[paragraph continues\] But I am not confident that all the difficulties
have been removed.
