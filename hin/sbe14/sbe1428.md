### CHAPTER XXV.

1\. I will completely explain the purification of those whose guilt has
not been made public, both from great crimes and for minor offences.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

2\. A penance prescribed in (the section on) secret (penances) is for an
Agnihotrin, an aged and a learned man, who have subdued their senses;
but other men (must perform the expiations) described above.

3\. Those constantly engaged in suppressing their breath, reciting
purificatory texts, giving gifts, making burnt-oblations, and muttering
(sacred texts) will, undoubtedly, be freed from (the guilt of) crimes
causing loss of caste.

4\. Seated with Ku*s*a grass in his hands, let him repeatedly suppress
his breath, and again and again recite purificatory texts, the
Vyâh*ri*tis, the syllable Om, and the daily portion of the Veda <span

5\. Always intent on the practice of Yoga, let him again and again
suppress his breath. Up to the ends of his hair and up to the ends of
his nails let him perform highest austerity. <span

6\. Through the obstruction (of the expiration) air is generated,
through air fire is produced, then through heat water is formed; hence
he is internally purified by (these) three.

7\. Neither through severe austerities, nor through the daily recitation
of the Veda, nor through offering sacrifices can the twice-born reach
that condition which they attain by the practice of Yoga.

8\. Through the practice of Yoga (true) knowledge is obtained, Yoga is
the sum of the sacred law, the practice of Yoga is the highest and
eternal austerity; therefore let him always be absorbed in the practice
of Yoga.

9\. For him who is constantly engaged in (reciting the syllable) Om, the
seven Vyâh*ri*tis, and the three-footed Gâyatrî no danger exists
anywhere. <span id="fr_676"></span>[9](#fn_676)

10\. The Vedas likewise begin with the syllable Om, and they end with
the syllable Om, the syllable Om is the sum of all speech; therefore let
him repeat it constantly. <span id="fr_677"></span>[10](#fn_677)

11\. The most excellent (portion of the) Veda, which consists of one
syllable, is declared to be the best purificatory text.

12\. If the guilt of all sins did fall on one man, to repeat the Gâyatrî
ten thousand times (would be) an efficient means of purification.

13\. If, suppressing his breath, he thrice recites the Gâyatrî together
with the Vyâh*ri*tis together with the syllable Om and with the (text
called) *S*iras, that is called one suppression of breath. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_674"></span>[125:4](sbe1428.htm#fr_674) **XXV**. Read
prâ*n*âyâmân in the text.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[125:5](sbe1428.htm#fr_675) The MSS. read at
the end of this verse, tapas tapyatam uttamam, while
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita gives tapas tapyât to uttamam. The correct reading
is probably tapas tapyatu uttamam.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[126:9](sbe1428.htm#fr_676) I read with the
MSS. bhaya*m* for bhave.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[126:10](sbe1428.htm#fr_677) Manu II, 74.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[126:13](sbe1428.htm#fr_678) Identical with
Vish*n*u LV, 9. Regarding the text called *S*iras, see above, XXI, 6.
