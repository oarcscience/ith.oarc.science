### PRA*S*NA II, ADHYÂYA 1, KA*ND*IKÂ 1.

1\. Now, therefore, the penances (will be described).

2\. The murderer of a learned Brâhma*n*a (shall practise the following
vow) during twelve years: <span id="fr_1046"></span>[2](#fn_1046.md)

3\. Carrying a skull (instead of a dish) and the foot of a bedstead
(instead of a staff), dressed in the hide of an ass, staying in the
forest, making a dead man's skull his flag, he shall cause a hut to be
built in a burial-ground and reside there; going to seven houses in
order to beg food, while proclaiming his deed, he shall support life
with what (he gets there), and shall fast if he obtains nothing;

4\. Or he may offer a horse-sacrifice, a Gosava, or an Agnish*t*ut <span

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

5\. Or he may bathe (with the priests) on the completion of a
horse-sacrifice (offered by somebody else). <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[5](#fn_1048.md)

6\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'He who unintentionally
slays a Brâhma*n*a becomes sinful according to the sacred law. The sages
declare that he may be purified (if he did it) unintentionally. But no
expiation is found for a wilful murderer.' <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[6](#fn_1049.md)

7\. He who has raised his hand (against a Brâhma*n*a), shall perform a
K*rikkh*ra penance, an Atik*rikkh*ra penance if he strikes, a K*rikkh*ra
and a *K*ândrâya*n*a if blood flows. Therefore let him neither raise his
hand nor cause blood to flow.' <span id="fr_1050"></span>[7](#fn_1050.md)

11\. Likewise for killing a woman. <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[11](#fn_1052.md)

12\. (The penance for killing) a woman who has bathed after temporary
uncleanness (is) the same (as that) for (the murder of) a
Brâhma*n*a. <span id="fr_1053"></span>[12](#fn_1053.md)

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

14\. Or embrace a red hot image (of a woman),

15\. Or cutting off his organ together with the testicles and holding
them in his joined hands, he shall walk towards the south-west until he
falls down (dead).

16\. A thief shall go to the king with flying hair, carrying on his
shoulder a club of Sindhraka wood (and say), 'Strike me with that.'
(Then the king) shall strike him. <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[16](#fn_1055.md)

17\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'A thief shall go to
the king carrying a club on his shoulder (and say to him), 'Punish me
with that, O king, remembering the duty of Kshatriyas.' <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[17](#fn_1056.md)

'Whether he be punished or be pardoned, the thief is freed from his
guilt. But if the king does not punish him, that guilt of the thief
falls on him.'

18\. If he has drunk (the spirituous liquor called) Surâ, he shall scald
himself to death with hot (liquor of the) same (kind). <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[18](#fn_1057.md)

19\. For unintentionally drinking (Surâ), he shall perform K*rikkh*ra
penances during three months and be initiated again, <span

20\. And (on this second initiation) the cutting (of <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[20](#fn_1059.md)

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

the hair and nails), the vows, and (the observance of the) restrictive
rules may be omitted.

21\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'A Brâhma*n*a,
Kshatriya, or Vai*s*ya who has unintentionally drunk (the spirituous
liquor called) Vâru*n*î or has swallowed urine or faeces must be
initiated a second time.' <span id="fr_1060"></span>[21](#fn_1060.md)

22\. 'But he who drinks water which has stood in a vessel, used for
keeping Surâ, shall live six days on milk in which (leaves of) the
*S*aṅkhapushpî plant have been boiled.' <span
id="fr_1061"></span>[22](#fn_1061.md)

23\. If (a pupil) who is employed by his teacher (on some errand) meets
with his death, (the teacher) shall perform three K*rikkh*ra
penances. <span id="fr_1062"></span>[23](#fn_1062.md)

24\. The same (penance) is prescribed for not finishing (the education
of the pupil). <span id="fr_1063"></span>[24](#fn_1063.md)

25\. If a student assists at the burial of anybody except (at that of
his) mother, of his father, or of his teacher, he must begin his vow
afresh. <span id="fr_1064"></span>[25](#fn_1064.md)

26\. If a (student) is sick, he may, at his pleasure, eat all the
fragments of his teacher's meal as medicine. <span

27\. He may physic himself with any (medicine) which he may

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

28\. When he is unable to move, he may worship the sun, after he has
risen, reciting this (*Ri*k verse): A swan, dwelling in purity.' <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[28](#fn_1067.md)

29\. When he has spent his manly strength in the day-time, let him
thrice drink water that reaches his heart, reciting the verses which
contain the word retas. <span id="fr_1068"></span>[29](#fn_1068.md)

30\. A student who approaches a woman (is called) an Avakîr*n*in, <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[30](#fn_1069.md)

31\. Let him offer an ass (in the place of) a sacrificial animal.

32\. The sacrificial meat-cake (puro*d*âsa shall be offered) to
Nir*ri*ti, or to the Râkshasas, or to Yama.

33\. It is declared in the Veda, 'The piece to be eaten by the
sacrificer (prâ*s*itra, shall be taken) from the organ (of the animal);
and the (other) portions shall be offered in water.' <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[33](#fn_1070.md)

34\. 'Or he may also heap (fuel) on the fire in the night of the new
moon, perform the preparatory rites required for the Darvîhoma, and
offer two <span id="fr_1071"></span>[34](#fn_1071.md)

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

oblations of clarified butter (reciting these two sacred texts): "O
Lust, I have broken my vow; my vow have I broken, O Lust; to Lust
Svâhâ;" "O Lust, I have done evil; evil have I done, O Lust; to Lust
Svâhâ."'

35\. 'After he has made the offering, he shall address the fire, closely
joining his hands, turning sideways (with the following texts): "May the
Maruts grant me, may Indra, may B*ri*haspati, may this fire grant me
long life and strength, may it make me long-lived! "'

36\. Now the relatives shall empty (the water-pot) of a (grievous
offender) at a (solemn) meeting (and he shall confess), 'I N. N. am (the
perpetrator of) such and such (a deed).' After (the outcast) has
performed (his penance) the Brâhma*n*as shall ask him who has touched
water, milk, clarified butter, honey, and salt, 'Hast thou performed
(thy penance)?' The other (person) shall answer, 'Om' (yes)! They shall
admit him who has performed (a penance) to all sacrificial rites, making
no difference (between him and others). <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[36](#fn_1072.md)

37\. If he unintentionally marries a female who belongs to his own
family (gotra), he shall support her, (treating her) like his
mother. <span id="fr_1073"></span>[37](#fn_1073.md)

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

38\. If (such a woman) has borne a child; he shall perform K*rikkh*ra
penances during three months and offer (two burnt oblations reciting)
the two (Mantras), 'That which is the blemish of my soul' (and) 'Fire
restored my sight.' <span id="fr_1074"></span>[38](#fn_1074.md)

39\. 'An elder brother whose younger brother marries first, the younger
brother who marries first, the damsel wedded (by the latter), he who
gives her away, and fifthly, he who sacrifices for them (at the
wedding), all sink to a region of torment.' <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[39](#fn_1075.md)

40\. The unmarried elder brother and the married younger brother, the
giver (of the maiden) and the performer of the sacrifices become pure by
undergoing a K*rikkh*ra penance of twelve days, the female (who has been
wedded to the younger brother) by (fasting during) three days.' <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[40](#fn_1076.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1046"></span>[211:2](sbe1455.htm#fr_1046.md)-3. **1**. Gautama
XXII, 4-6; Vish*n*u L, I-3, 15. The expression 'staying in the forest'
means that the sinner shall not stop in the village or the fields during
the day-time, but live in some uncultivated tract in the neighbourhood.

<span id="fn_1047"></span>[211:4](sbe1455.htm#fr_1047.md) Gautama XIX,
9-10. The Gosava sacrifice is an Ekâha see Kâtyâyana *S*rauta Sûtra

<span id="fn_1051"></span>[212:8](sbe1455.htm#fr_1051.md)-10. Vasish*th*a
XX, 31-33. The words 'shall keep the normal vow of continence' have been
inserted in accordance with Govinda's explanation, which apparently is
based on Gautama XXII, 14. But it is also possible that Baudhâyana, like
Vish*n*u (L, 15) and others, may have intended murderers of Kshatriyas,
Vai*s*yas, &c., too, to perform the penance prescribed above, Sûtra 4,
only for shorter periods.

<span id="fn_1052"></span>[212:11](sbe1455.htm#fr_1052.md) Gautama XXII,
17. Govinda is of opinion that the word ka, 'likewise,' is intended to
include 'worthless' Kshatriyas and Vai*s*yas.

<span id="fn_1062"></span>[214:23](sbe1455.htm#fr_1062.md) Vasish*th*a
XXIII, 10.

<span id="fn_1063"></span>[214:24](sbe1455.htm#fr_1063.md) 'Finishing (the
education of the pupil, sa*m*sk*ri*tam), i.e. teaching him the rules of
purification, of conduct, and so forth; failing (to do) that (is called)
not finishing (the education of the pupil). For that (omission) the same
(penance), i.e. three K*rikkh*ras (are to be) performed.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1064"></span>[214:25](sbe1455.htm#fr_1064.md) Vasish*th*a
XXIII; 7-8. 'Assists at a burial (*s*avakarma), i.e. lays out a corpse,
and so forth (ala*m*kara*n*âdi), or carries it out, and so
forth.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1065"></span>[214:26](sbe1455.htm#fr_1065.md) Vasish*th*a
XXIII, 9, and note.

<span id="fn_1066"></span>[214:27](sbe1455.htm#fr_1066.md) 'The meaning is
that he may cure himself even with such <span id="page_215">p.
215</span> (substances) which are forbidden even to his teacher, e.g.
garlic, and so forth.' For a Sm*ri*ti declares,' He shall protect
himself by every means.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1067"></span>[215:28](sbe1455.htm#fr_1067.md) 'Unable to
move,' i.e. sick. This is a penance to be performed by a sick. student
when he is unable to fulfil the rules enjoining the morning and evening
prayers, and the like; and it applies to other men also because there is
no objection. Regarding the Mantra, see Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ I, 8, 15,
2.

<span id="fn_1068"></span>[215:29](sbe1455.htm#fr_1068.md) The rule refers
to intercourse with a wife in the day-time; see Vish*n*u LIII, 4. The
Retasyâs occur Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka I, 30.

<span id="fn_1069"></span>[215:30](sbe1455.htm#fr_1069.md) Vasish*th*a
XXIII, 1.

<span id="fn_1070"></span>[215:33](sbe1455.htm#fr_1070.md) Weber, Ind.
Stud. X, 102; Kâtyâyana *S*rauta Sûtra I, 1, 15.

<span id="fn_1071"></span>[215:34](sbe1455.htm#fr_1071.md) Taitt.
Âra*n*yaka II, r 8. The Âra*n*yaka has, more appropriately, pra*n*îya,
'having taken out,' before upasamâdhâya, 'may heap (fuel) upon.' The
Dekhan and Gu*g*arât MSS. insert the words 'am*ri*ta*m* <span
id="page_216">p. 216</span> vâ â*g*yam am*ri*tam evâtman dhatte,' which
occur also in the Âra*n*yaka, after the Mantra. According to Govinda
pari*k*esh*t*â, 'preparatory rites,' refers to the consecration of the
clarified butter, and so forth, The special rules regarding the
Darvîhomas are given Kâtyâyana *S*rauta Sûtra VI, 10, 17 seq.

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[216:36](sbe1455.htm#fr_1072.md) Vasish*th*a XV,
12-21. Govinda thinks that nirvi*s*esha*m* savanîya*m* kuryu*h*, 'they
shall admit him to all sacrificial rites, making no difference,' may
also be interpreted by 'they shall perform for him the sacraments just
as for a new-born child.'

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[216:37](sbe1455.htm#fr_1073.md) Colebrooke V,
Dig. CCCXL.

<span id="fn_1074"></span>[217:38](sbe1455.htm#fr_1074.md) The Mantras are
found, Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ III, 2, 5, 4.

<span id="fn_1075"></span>[217:39](sbe1455.htm#fr_1075.md) Vasish*th*a XX,
7-8. The MSS. read parivitti*h* parivettâ ya*s* *k*ainâ*m* \[na*m*\]
parivindati. But it is absolutely necessary to adopt either the various
reading given Manu III, 172, yayâ *k*a parividyate, or to read yâ
*k*aina*m* parivindati.

<span id="fn_1076"></span>[217:40](sbe1455.htm#fr_1076.md) The MSS. all
read at the end of the verse, tristrirâtre*n*a or dvistrirâtre*n*a. The
correct reading appears, however, to be strî trirâtre*n*a; for Govinda
says, yayâ saha parivettâ bhûtas \[bhûttasya C. L, bhûtassâstri C. T.\]
tasyâs trirâtre*n*opavâsena *s*uddhi*h*, 'the purification of that
female with whom he has become a parivett*ri* takes place through three
days, i.e. through fasting (three days).'
