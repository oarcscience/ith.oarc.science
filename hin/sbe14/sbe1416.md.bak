<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

sesamum, or food, or whatever be the (gift) at a *S*râddha, let him not,

35\. When a preternaturally loud sound is heard in the sky, when a

(immediately succeeding the event). <span
id="fr_394"></span>[35](#fn_394.md)

36\. If meteors and lightning appear together, (the interruption shall

38\. (If rain or other celestial phenomena come) out of season, (the

46\. When a salute is returned, the last vowel (of the noun standing) in
the vocative is produced to the length of three moras, and if it is a
diphthong (e or o) changeable according to the Sandhi rules, it becomes
ây or âv, e.g. bho, bhâv. <span id="fr_401"></span>[46](#fn_401.md)

47\. A father who has committed a crime causing loss of caste must be

48\. Now they quote also (the following verses): <span
id="fr_403"></span>[48](#fn_403.md)

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

\[paragraph continues\] 'The teacher (â*k*ârya) is ten times more
venerable than a sub-teacher (upâdhyâya), the father a hundred times
more than the teacher, and the mother a thousand times more than the
father.'

49\. 'A wife, sons, and pupils who are defiled by sinful deeds, must
first be reproved, and (if they do not amend, then) be cast off. He who
forsakes them in any other way, becomes (himself) an outcast.' <span
id="fr_404"></span>[49](#fn_404.md)

50\. An officiating priest and a teacher who neglect to teach the
recitation of the Veda, or to sacrifice, shall be cast off. If he does
not forsake them, he becomes an outcast. <span
id="fr_405"></span>[50](#fn_405.md)

51\. They declare that the male offspring of outcasts are (also)
outcasts, but not the females. <span id="fr_406"></span>[51](#fn_406.md)

52\. For a female enters (the family of) a stranger.

53\. He may marry such a (female) without a dowry. <span
id="fr_407"></span>[53](#fn_407.md)

54\. 'If the teacher's teacher is near, he must be treated like the
teacher (himself). The Veda declares that one must behave towards the
teacher's son just as towards the teacher.' <span
id="fr_408"></span>[54](#fn_408.md)

55\. A Brâhma*n*a shall not accept (as gifts) weapons, poison, and
spirituous liquor.

56\. Learning, wealth, age, relationship, and occupation must be
honoured. <span id="fr_409"></span>[56](#fn_409.md)

57\. (But) each earlier named (quality) is more venerable than (the
succeeding ones).

58\. If he meets aged men, infants, sick men, load-carriers, women, and
persons riding in chariots, he <span id="fr_410"></span>[58](#fn_410.md)

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

must make way (for them, i.e.) for each later (named before those
enumerated earlier).

59\. If a king and a Snâtaka meet, the king must make (way) for the
Snâtaka.

60\. All (must make way) for a bride who is being conveyed (to her
husband's house).

61\. Grass, room (for resting), fire, water, a welcome, and kind words
never fail in the houses of good men. <span

Vish*n*u XXX, 10. The above translation follows K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita's
gloss. But the Sûtra may also be taken differently: 'In (villages) where
a corpse lies or a *K*â*nd*âla stays (and) in towns.' For the
prohibition to study in towns is mentioned by Gautama XVI, 45; Manu IV,
116; and Âpastamba I, 3, 9, 4.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[64:12](sbe1416.htm#fr_375.md) Âpastamba I, 3, 9,

somewhat resembles the verse quoted. But <span id="page_65">p. 65</span>
its altered form shows clearly that the Mânava Dharma*s*âstra known to
Vasish*th*a differed from the work which at present goes by that name.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[66:35](sbe1416.htm#fr_394.md) Gautama XVI, 22;
Manu IV, 105, 115. K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita mentions digdâha, 'when the sky
appears preternaturally red,' as a various reading for 'dignâda.'
