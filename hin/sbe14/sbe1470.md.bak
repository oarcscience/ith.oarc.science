### PRA*S*NA II, ADHYÂYA 9, KA*ND*IKÂ 16.

1\. (Now follows some) advice for him who is desirous of offspring.

2\. The two A*s*vins have declared, that fame is gained by the
procreation (of sons);

3\. 'Performing acts which tend to prolong life and austerities, intent
on the performance of the private recitation and of sacrifices, and
keeping his organs in subjection, let him carefully beget offspring in
his own caste.'

4\. 'From his birth a Brâhma*n*a is loaded with three debts; these let
him pay. A prudent man is free from doubts regarding the sacred law.'

5\. 'If he worships the sages through the study of the Veda, Indra with
Soma sacrifices, and the manes of his ancestors through (the procreation
of) children, he will rejoice in heaven, free from debt.'

6\. 'Through a son he conquers the worlds, through a grandson he obtains
immortality, but through his son's grandson he ascends to the (highest)
heaven.' (All that) has been declared in the Veda. <span

7\. The Veda shows the existence of the three debts in the following
(passage): 'A Brâhma*n*a is born loaded with three debts; (he owes) the
studentship to the sages, sacrifices to the gods, and a son to the
manes;' <span id="fr_1290"></span>[7](#fn_1290.md)

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

8\. Through the procreation of a virtuous son he saves himself.

9\. He who obtains a virtuous son saves from the fear of sin seven in
the descending line and seven in the ascending line, (viz.) six others
(in each), himself being the seventh.

10\. Therefore he obtains a reward if he begets issue.

11\. Therefore he should sedulously beget offspring, <span

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

12\. Through the application of medicines and sacred texts.

13\. The advice to him (who is intent on the procreation of children) is
given in agreement with the revealed texts. <span

14\. For it produces results in the case of all the castes.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1289"></span>[271:6](sbe1470.htm#fr_1289.md) Vasish*th*a XVII,
5.

<span id="fn_1290"></span>[271:7](sbe1470.htm#fr_1290.md) Vasish*th*a XI,
48. After this Sûtra the MSS. of the text <span id="page_272">p.
272</span> insert the following corrupt passage: bandham ri*n*amoksham
pra*g*âyâ*s* *k*âyattam pi*trî*nâ*m* *k*ânukarsha*s*abda*s* *k*a
pra*g*âyâ*m* dar*s*ayati \| anutsanna*h* pra*g*âvân bhavati \| yâ vad
ena*m* pra*g*ânug*ri*h*n*îte tâvad akshaya*m* loka*m* gayati. The
commentary does not notice it, and it seems to me that it needlessly
interrupts the context.

<span id="fn_1291"></span>[272:11](sbe1470.htm#fr_1291.md) M. and K. add to
this Sûtra, âtmana*h* phalalâbhâya, 'in order to gain a reward for
himself.' The same two MSS., further, insert the following Sûtras:
tasmât putra*m* *k*otpâdyâtmânam evotpâdayatîti \| vi*gñ*âyate *k*âtmâ
vai putranâmâsîti \| eva*m* dvitîya âtmâ *g*îvatâ drash*t*avyo ya*h*
putram utpâdayati \| sa tathâ bhavati \| tasmân nâtmâ kva*k*id akshetra
utsrash*t*avya*h* \| âtmânam avamanyate hi \| yathâtmânam utpâdayati sa
tathâ bhavati \| tasmâd âdita eva kshetram anvi*kkh*et sarvavar*n*e
sa*m*sk*ri*tam upade*s*ena \| tasmin dârasa*m*yoge pra*g*âm utpâdayed
\|\| 'Therefore (they say) that he who begets a son produces even his
own self; and it is declared in the Veda, "Thou art self, called a son."
Thus he who begets a son will see, during his lifetime, a second self.
He becomes like him. Therefore one's own self must not be begotten on an
unworthy female. For (he who does that) despises himself. He becomes
even so, as he produces himself. Therefore (every man), each in his own
caste, should first look out for a female who has been sanctified
according to the injunction (of the sacred texts). Taking her to be his
wedded wife, he shall beget a son.' It is possible that this passage
really belongs to Baudhâyana, for it is written in the usual style of
our Sûtra, and the last word of this passage as well as of Sûtra 11, as
given in the Dekhan MSS., is utpâdayet. But it is not absolutely
required by the context, and the commentary too omits it.

<span id="fn_1292"></span>[273:13](sbe1470.htm#fr_1292.md) I read with M.,
whose reading is confirmed by the explanation given in the commentary,
tasyopade*s*a*h* *s*rutisâmânyenopadi*s*yate. The other MS. reads
tasyopade*s*ena, and in the text of the commentary the first word is
left out.
