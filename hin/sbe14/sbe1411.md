### CHAPTER VIII.

1\. (A student who desires to become) a house-holder shall bathe, free
from anger and elation, with the permission of his teacher, and take for
a wife a young female of his own caste, who does neither belong to the
same Gotra nor has the same Pravara, who has not had intercourse (with
another man), <span id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_239.md)

2\. Who is not related within four degrees on the mother's side, nor
within six degrees on the father s side. <span
id="fr_240"></span>[2](#fn_240.md)

3\. Let him kindle the nuptial fire. <span
id="fr_241"></span>[3](#fn_241.md)

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

4\. Let him not turn away a guest who comes in the evening. <span
id="fr_242"></span>[4](#fn_242.md)

5\. (A guest) shall not dwell in his house without receiving food. <span
id="fr_243"></span>[5](#fn_243.md)

6\. If a Brâhma*n*a who has come for shelter to the house of a
(householder) receives no food, on departure he will take with him all
the spiritual merit of that (churlish host). <span
id="fr_244"></span>[6](#fn_244.md)

7\. But a Brâhma*n*a who stays for one night only is called a guest. For
(the etymological import of the word) atithi (a guest) is 'he who stays
for a short while only.' <span id="fr_245"></span>[7](#fn_245.md)

8\. A Brâhma*n*a who lives in the same village (with his host) and a
visitor on business, or pleasure (are) not (called guests. But a guest),
whether he arrives at the moment (of dinner) or at an inopportune time,
must not stay in the house of a (householder) without receiving
food. <span id="fr_246"></span>[8](#fn_246.md)

9\. (A householder) who has faith, is free from covetousness, and
(possesses wealth) sufficient for (performing) the Agnyâdheya-sacrifice,
must become an Agnihotrin. <span id="fr_247"></span>[9](#fn_247.md)

10\. He (who possesses wealth) sufficient for (the expenses of) a Soma,
sacrifice shall not abstain from offering it. <span
id="fr_248"></span>[10](#fn_248.md)

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

11\. (A householder) shall be industrious in reciting the Veda, offering
sacrifices, begetting children, and (performing his other duties). <span
id="fr_249"></span>[11](#fn_249.md)

12\. Let him honour visitors (who come) to his house by rising to meet
them, by (offering them) seats, by speaking to them kindly and extolling
their virtues, <span id="fr_250"></span>[12](#fn_250.md)

13\. And all creatures by (giving them) food according to his
ability. <span id="fr_251"></span>[13](#fn_251.md)

14\. A householder alone performs sacrifices, a householder alone
performs austerities, and (therefore) the order of householders is the
most distinguished among the four. <span
id="fr_252"></span>[14](#fn_252.md)

15\. As all rivers, both great and small, find a resting-place in the
ocean, even so men of all orders find protection with
householders. <span id="fr_253"></span>[15](#fn_253.md)

16\. As all creatures exist through the protection afforded by their
mothers, even so all mendicants subsist through the protection afforded
by householders.

17\. A Brâhma*n*a who always carries water (in his gourd), who always
wears the sacred thread, who daily recites the Veda, who avoids the food
of outcasts, who approaches (his wife) in the proper season, and offers
sacrifices in accordance with the <span id="fr_254"></span>[17](#fn_254.md)

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

rules (of the Veda, after death) never falls from Brahman's heaven.

studentship, see Vish*n*u XXVIII, 42, and Professor Jolly's note.

Professor Jolly's note. The fire intended is the g*ri*hya or smârta, the
sacred household fire, which according o this Sûtra must be kindled on
the occasion of the marriage ceremony, while other Sm*ri*tis permit of
its being lighted on the division of the paternal estate.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[43:9](sbe1411.htm#fr_247.md) Vish*n*u LIX, 2. The
Agnihotra which is here 'intended is, of course, the *S*rauta Agnihotra,
to be performed with three fires. The Agnyâdheya is one of the
Havirya*gñ*as with which the *S*rautâgnihotrin has to begin his rites.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[43:10](sbe1411.htm#fr_248.md) Vish*n*u LIX, 8.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[44:11](sbe1411.htm#fr_249.md) I agree with
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita that the word 'and' used in this enumeration serves
the purpose of calling to mind that there are other minor duties. The
three named specially are the so-called 'three debts;' see below, XI,
48.

VI, 90.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[44:17](sbe1411.htm#fr_254.md) 'Who always carries
water (in his gourd)' (nityodakî) may also be translated, 'who always
keeps water (in his house);' see Âpastamba II, 1, 1, 15. 'Who always
wears the sacred thread' <span id="page_45">p. 45</span> may also mean
'who always wears his upper in the manner required at a sacrifice,' i.e.
passes it over the left and under the right arm.
