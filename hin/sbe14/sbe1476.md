### PRA*S*NA III, ADHYÂYA 4.

1\. Now if a student commits any act against his vow, eats meat, or
approaches a woman, whenever any evil befals him, <span

2\. He heaps fuel on the fire in the interior of the house, scatters
(Ku*s*a grass) around it, and performs the ceremonies up to the end of
the Agnimukha; then he offers oblations of clarified butter, (reciting
the following texts): 'It was done by lust, lust does

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

it, to lust (belongs) all this, to him who draws me on, Svâhâ;' 'It was
done by the internal organ, the internal organ does it, to the internal
organ (belongs) all this, to him who draws me on, Svâhâ;' 'It was done
by passion, passion does it, to passion (belongs) all this, to him who
draws me on, Svâhâ;' 'It was done by ignorance, ignorance does it, to
ignorance (belongs) all this, to him who draws me on, Svâhâ;' 'It was
done by sin, sin does it, to sin (belongs) all this, to him who draws me
on, Svâhâ;' 'It was done by wrath, wrath does it, to wrath (belongs) all
this, to him who draws me on, Svâhâ.'

3\. That which begins with the muttering (of the Vedic texts) and ends
with the gift of a fee (consisting of) a cow is known,

4\. (Afterwards) he stays (during the night) behind (i. e. to the west
of) the fire, wrapping himself in the skin of a black antelope, the neck
of which is turned towards the east and the hair of which is turned
outside.

5\. When the day dawns, he drags himself away from the hinder part (of
the skin), goes to a bathing-place, bathes (there) in the manner which
is known, (but) performs, while in the water, sixteen suppressions of
breath with the Aghamarsha*n*a hymn; next he performs the known
(ceremonies) up to the worship of the sun, and afterwards goes to the
house of his teacher. <span id="fr_1355"></span>[5](#fn_1355)

6\. Let him know for certain that that is equally (effective) as bathing
(with the priests) at the end of a horse-sacrifice.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1354"></span>[294:1](sbe1476.htm#fr_1354) **4**. The clause
striya*m* vopeyât, 'or approaches a woman,' is omitted by Govinda. The
whole chapter is a supplement to the rules given above, II, 1, 1, 30-35,
where some of the Vedic passages mentioned here have already been given.

<span id="fn_1355"></span>[295:5](sbe1476.htm#fr_1355) Govinda says that
this manner of crawling out of the skin is symbolical of a new birth.
