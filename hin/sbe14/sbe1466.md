### PRA*S*NA II, ADHYÂYA 7, KA*ND*IKÂ 12.

1\. Now we will explain the oblations (offered) to the vital air
(prâ*n*a) by *S*âlînas (householders) and Yâyâvaras (vagrants), who
sacrifice to the soul. <span id="fr_1259"></span>[1](#fn_1259.md)

2\. At the end of all the necessary (daily rites), let him sit down,
facing the east, in a place that has been well cleaned and smeared with
cowdung; next let him worship that prepared (food) which is being
brought. (saying), 'Bhû*h*, Bhuva*h*, Sva*h*, Om,' (and then) remain
silent.

3\. (Next) he pours water round the food which has been placed (before
him), turning his right hand towards it, and reciting the
Mahâvyâh*ri*tis; (afterwards), continuing to hold (the dish) with his
left hand, he first drinks water, (saying), 'Thou art a substratum for
ambrosia,' and (finally) offers five oblations of food to the vital
airs, (reciting the <span id="fr_1260"></span>[3](#fn_1260.md)

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

texts), 'Full of reverence, I offer ambrosia to Prâ*n*a; mayest thou
propitiously enter me, not in order to burn me. To Prâ*n*a, Svâhâ!' &c.

4\. After offering the five oblations of food to the vital airs, let him
finish his meal silently. Meditating in his heart on the lord of created
beings, let him not emit speech while (eating),

5\. If he emits speech, he shall mutter 'Bhû*h*, Bhuva*h*, Sva*h*, Om,'
and afterwards continue to eat.

6\. Now they quote also (the following rule): 'If he sees (bits of)
skin, hair, nail-(parings), insects, or the dung of rats (in his food),
'he shall take out a lump, sprinkle that spot with water, scatter ashes
on it, again sprinkle it with water, and use (the remainder of the
food), after it has been declared fit (for use).' <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[6](#fn_1261.md)

7\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He shall eat, seated
with his face towards the east, silent, not despising his food, not
scattering (fragments on the ground), and solely attend (to his dinner);
and, after he has eaten, he shall touch fire.' <span
id="fr_1262"></span>[7](#fn_1262.md)

8\. He shall not cut off with his teeth (pieces from) eatables (that
must be swallowed) entire, (such as) cakes, bulbs, roots, fruit, and
flesh.

9\. (Let him) not (eat) to repletion. <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[9](#fn_1263.md)

10\. After (dinner) he shall drink water, (reciting the text), 'Thou art
'a covering for ambrosia,' and stroke (the region of) the heart,
(saying), 'Thou art the bond that connects the vital airs; (thou
art) <span id="fr_1264"></span>[10](#fn_1264.md)

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Rudra and Death; enter me; mayest thou grow
through this food.'

11\. After sipping water a second time, he allows (the drops from) the
hand to flow on the big toe of his right foot (and recites the following
text): 'May the male be pleased, he who is of the size of a thumb, who
occupies (a space of the size of) a thumb, who is the lord of the whole
world, masterful, and the enjoyer of the universe.' <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[11](#fn_1265.md)

12\. Let him perform the subsequent consecration (anumantra*n*a) of the
(food which has been) offered, with raised arms, (and let him recite)
the five (texts beginning), 'With faith, worshipping Prâ*n*a, (I have)
offered ambrosia; mayest thou increase Prâ*n*a through this food,' <span
id="fr_1266"></span>[12](#fn_1266.md)

13\. (And let him address the soul with the last text of the Anuvâka),
'(May) my soul (gain) immortality in the universal soul.'

14\. And let him (meditate on his) soul (as) united with the
imperishable (syllable Om). <span id="fr_1267"></span>[14](#fn_1267.md)

15\. He who sacrifices to the soul, surpasses him who offers all
sacrifices.
