### PRA*S*NA III, ADHYÂYA 10.

1\. The law of castes and of orders has been declared. <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[1](#fn_1392.md)

2\. Now, indeed, man (in) this (world is polluted) by a vile action or
acts wrongly, (e.g.) sacrifices for men. unworthy to offer a sacrifice,
accepts presents from those whose gifts ought not to be accepted, eats
the food of those whose food ought not to be eaten, (and) practises what
is forbidden. <span id="fr_1393"></span>[2](#fn_1393.md)

3\. They are in doubt if he shall perform a penance for such (a deed) or
if he shall not do it.

4\. (They declare that he shall not do it) because the deed does not
perish.

5\. (The correct opinion is) that he shall perform (a penance). <span
id="fr_1394"></span>[5](#fn_1394.md)

6\. It is declared in the Veda, 'Let him offer a Punastoma; (those who
offer it, may) again come to (partake of) the libations of Soma.' <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[6](#fn_1395.md)

7\. He who offers a horse-sacrifice conquers all sin, he effaces the
guilt of the murder of a Brâhma*n*a.' <span
id="fr_1396"></span>[7](#fn_1396.md)

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

8\. Moreover, 'He who is being accused (of a heinous crime) shall
perform an Agnish*t*ut sacrifice.'

9\. Reciting the Veda, austerity, a sacrifice, fasting, giving gifts are
the means for expiating such (a blamable act).

10\. The purificatory (texts are), the Upanishads, the initial (verses)
of the Vedas, the ends of the Vedas (vedântas), the Sa*m*hitâs of all
the Vedas, (the Anuvâkas called) Madhu, (the hymn of) Aghamarsha*n*a,
the Atharva*s*iras, (the Anuvâkas called the) Rudras, the Purusha hymn,
the two Sâmans (called) Râ*g*ina and Rauhi*n*eya, the B*ri*hat (Sâman)
and the Rathantara, the Purushagati (Sâman), the Mahânâmnîs, the
Mahâvairâ*g*a (Sâman), the Mahâdivâkîrtya (Sâman), any of the
*G*yesh*th*a Sâmans, the Bahishpavamâna Sâman, the Kûshmâ*nd*îs, the
Pâvamânîs, and the Sâvitrî. <span id="fr_1397"></span>[10](#fn_1397.md)

11\. To live on milk alone, as if one were fasting, to eat vegetables
only, to eat fruit only, (to live on) gruel prepared of a handful of
barley-grains, to eat gold, to eat clarified butter (are the modes of
subsistence) which purify.

12\. All mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, bathing-places, the
dwellings of *Ri*shis, cowpens, (holy) plains and temples of the gods
(are) places (which destroy sin) <span
id="fr_1398"></span>[12](#fn_1398.md)

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

13\. Abstention from injuring living beings, truthfulness, abstention
from theft (or unrighteously appropriating anything), bathing in the
morning, at noon, and in the evening, obedience towards Gurus,
continence, sleeping on the ground, dressing in one garment only, and
abstaining from food (are the various kinds of) austerity.

14\. Gold, a cow, a dress, a horse, land, sesamum, clarified butter, and
food (are) the gifts.

15\. A year, six months, four (months), three (months), two (months),
one (month), twenty-four days, twelve days, six days, three days, a day
and a night, (and) one day are the periods (for penances).

16\. These (acts) may be optionally performed if no (particular penance)
has been prescribed,

17\. (Viz.) for great crimes difficult (penances) and for trivial faults
easy ones.

18\. The K*rikkh*ra and the Atik*rikkh*ra, as well as the
*K*ândrâya*n*a, are penances for all (offences).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1392"></span>[310:1](sbe1482.htm#fr_1392.md) **10**. As stated
formerly, Sacred Books of the East, vol. ii, p. li this chapter is
borrowed from Gautama XIX. I have therefore adopted the same division of
the Sûtras as in the translation of the latter work.

<span id="fn_1393"></span>[310:2](sbe1482.htm#fr_1393.md) I read, with the
MSS. of the commentary, atha khalvaya*m* purusho yâpyena karma*n*â
mithyâ vâ*k*araty ayâgya*m* vâ yâgayaty apratigrâhyasya vâ
pratig*ri*h*n*âty anâ*s*yânnasya vânnam a*s*nâty a*k*ara*n*îyena
vâ*k*arati. M. reads yâ*g*ayitvâ, and the Dekhan MSS. yâ*g*ayitvâ and
pratig*ri*hya.

<span id="fn_1394"></span>[310:5](sbe1482.htm#fr_1394.md) The Dekhan MSS.
read kûryâd ity eva, M. kûryâd eva, and Govinda kuryât tv eva.

<span id="fn_1395"></span>[310:6](sbe1482.htm#fr_1395.md) All the MSS. of
the text omit the word vi*gñ*âyate, 'it is declared in the Veda,' which
is given by Govinda.

<span id="fn_1396"></span>[310:7](sbe1482.htm#fr_1396.md) All the MSS. of
the text give at the beginning of this Sûtra <span id="page_311">p.
311</span> athâpy udâharanti, 'now they quote also,' which Govinda
omits, and which is inappropriate, because the following passages are
taken from the Veda.

<span id="fn_1397"></span>[311:10](sbe1482.htm#fr_1397.md) The word
vedâdaya*h*, which occurs also in some MSS. of Vasish*th*a (XXII, 9),
must be explained, according to the analogy of karmâdi, the beginning of
the sacrifices' (Sâya*n*a on Taitt. Âr. II, 7, 5), by 'the initial
verses of the Vedas.' The Pâvamânîs are added on the authority of
Govinda alone.

<span id="fn_1398"></span>[311:12](sbe1482.htm#fr_1398) 'Kshetra, (holy.md)
plains, e.g. the Kurukshetra.'--Govinda.
