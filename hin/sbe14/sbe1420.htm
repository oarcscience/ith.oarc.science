<p>1. The father throws his debts on the (son) and obtains immortality if he sees the face of a living son.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_486"></A><A HREF="#fn_486"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. It is declared in the Veda, 'Endless are the worlds of those who have sons; there is no place for the man who is destitute of male offspring.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_487"></A><A HREF="#fn_487"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>3. There is a curse (in the Veda), 'May our enemies be destitute of offspring.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_488"></A><A HREF="#fn_488"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>4. There is also (the following) passage of the Veda, 'May I obtain, O Agni, immortality by offspring.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_489"></A><A HREF="#fn_489"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>5. 'Through a son he conquers the worlds, through a grandson he obtains immortality, but through his son's grandson he gains the world of the sun.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_490"></A><A HREF="#fn_490"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>6. There is a dispute (among the wise; some say), The son belongs to the husband of the wife;' (and some say), 'The son belongs to the begetter.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_491"></A><A HREF="#fn_491"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>7. With respect to this (matter) they quote also on both sides verses like the following:</p>  
<p>8. (Some say), 'If (one man's) bull were to beget a hundred calves on another man's cows, they would belong to the owner of the cows; in vain would the bull have spent his strength.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_492"></A><A HREF="#fn_492"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A></p>  
<p>9. (Others say), 'Carefully watch the procreation of your offspring, lest strangers sow seed on your soil; in the next world the son belongs to the begetter; (by carelessness) a husband makes (the possession of) offspring in vain.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_493"></A><A HREF="#fn_493"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>10. If amongst many brothers who are begotten by one father, one have a son, they all have offspring through that son; thus says the Veda.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_494"></A><A HREF="#fn_494"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>11. If among many wives of one husband, one have a son, they all have offspring through that son; thus says the Veda.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_495"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>12. Twelve (kinds of) sons only are noticed by the ancients.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_496"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>13. The first (among these is the son) begotten by the husband himself on his legally married wife.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_497"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>  
<p>14. The second is the son of a wife (who is begotten) on failure of the (first) on a (wife or widow duly) authorised (thereto, by a kinsman).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A></p>  
<p>15. The third is an appointed daughter.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A></p>  
<p>16. It is declared in the Veda, 'A maiden who has no brothers comes back to the male ancestors (of her own family); returning she becomes their son.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_500"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>17. With reference to this (matter there is) a verse (to be spoken by the father when appointing daughter), 'I shall give thee a brotherless damsel, decked with ornaments; the son whom she may bear, shall be my son.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>18. The fourth is the son of a remarried woman.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></p>  
<p>19. She is called remarried (punarbh&ucirc;) who leaving the husband of her youth, and having lived with others, re-enters his family;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A></p>  
<p>20. And she is called remarried who leaving an impotent, outcast or mad husband, or after the death of her husband takes another lord.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>21. The fifth is the son of an unmarried damsel.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>  
<p>22. They declare that the son whom an unmarried damsel produces through lust in her father's house, is the son of his maternal grandfather.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A></p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A></p>  
<p>23. Now they quote also (the following verse): If an unmarried daughter bear a son begotten by a man of equal caste, the maternal grandfather has a son through him; he shall offer the funeral cake, and take the wealth (of his grandfather).'</p>  
<p>24. (A male child) secretly born in the house is the sixth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A></p>  
<p>25. They declare that these (six) are heirs and kinsmen, preservers from a great danger.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A></p>  
<p>26. Now among those (sons) who are not heirs, but kinsmen, the first is he who is received with a pregnant bride.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_509"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A></p>  
<p>27. (The son of a damsel) who is married pregnant (is called) a son received with the bride (saho<I>dh</I>a).</p>  
<p>28. The second is the adopted son,</p>  
<p>29. (He) whom his father and his mother give (in adoption).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A></p>  
<p>30. (The son) bought is the third.</p>  
<p>31. That is explained by (the story of) Suna<I>h</I><I>s</I>epa.</p>  
<p>32. 'Hari<I>s</I><I>k</I>andra, forsooth, was a king. He bought the son of A<I>g</I>&icirc;garta Sauyavasi.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A></p>  
<p>33. The fourth is (the son) self-given.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A></p>  
<p>34. That is (likewise) explained by (the story of) Suna<I>h</I><I>s</I>epa.</p>  
<p>35. 'Suna<I>h</I><I>s</I>epa, forsooth, when tied to the sacrificial stake, praised the gods; there the gods loosened his bonds. To him poke (each of) the officiating priests, "He shall be my son." He did not agree to their (request. Then) they made him make (this) agreement, "He shall be the son of him whom he chooses." Vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;mitra was the Hot<I>ri</I> priest at that (sacrifice). He became his son.'</p>  
<p>36. The son cast off is the fifth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_513"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A></p>  
<p>37. (He is called so) who, cast off by his father and his mother, is received (as a son).</p>  
<p>38. They declare that the son of a woman of the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra caste is the sixth. These (six) are kinsmen, not heirs.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_514"></A><A HREF="#fn_514"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A></p>  
<p>39. Now they quote also (the following rule): 'These (last-mentioned) six (sons) shall take the heritage of him who has no heir belonging to the first-mentioned six (classes).</p>  
<p>40. Now (follow the rules regarding) the partition of the (paternal) estate among brothers:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_515"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A></p>  
<p>41. And (let it be delayed) until those (widows) who have no offspring, (but are supposed to be pregnant), bear sons.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_516"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A></p>  
<p>42. Let the eldest take a double share,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A></p>  
<p>43. And a tithe of the kine and horses.</p>  
<p>

<p>44. The goats, the sheep, and the house belong to the youngest,</p>  
<p>45. Black iron, the utensils, and the furniture to the middlemost.</p>  
<p>46. Let the daughters divide the nuptial present of their mother.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_518"></A><A HREF="#fn_518"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A></p>  
<p>47. If a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a has issue by wives belonging to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, Kshatriya, and Vai<I>s</I>ya classes respectively,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_519"></A><A HREF="#fn_519"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A></p>  
<p>48. The son of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a wife shall receive three shares,</p>  
<p>49. The son of the Kshatriya wife two shares,</p>  
<p>50. The other (sons) shall inherit equal shares.</p>  
<p>51. And if one of the (brothers) has gained something by his own (effort), he shall receive a double share.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_520"></A><A HREF="#fn_520"><FONT SIZE="1">51</FONT></A></p>  
<p>52. But those who have entered a different order receive no share,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_521"></A><A HREF="#fn_521"><FONT SIZE="1">52</FONT></A></p>  
<p>53. Nor (those who are) eunuchs, madmen, or outcasts.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_522"></A><A HREF="#fn_522"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A></p>  
<p>54. Eunuchs and madmen (have a claim to) maintenance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_523"></A><A HREF="#fn_523"><FONT SIZE="1">54</FONT></A></p>

<p>on the ground during six months, practising religious vows and abstaining from pungent condiments and salt.</p>  
<p>56. After the completion of six months she shall bathe, and offer a funeral oblation to her husband. (Then) her father or her brother shall assemble the Gurus who taught or sacrificed (for the deceased) and his relatives, and shall appoint her (to raise issue to her deceased husband).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_525"></A><A HREF="#fn_525"><FONT SIZE="1">56</FONT></A></p>  
<p>57. Let him not appoint a (widow who is) mad, ill-conducted, or diseased,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_526"><FONT SIZE="1">57</FONT></A></p>  
<p>58. Nor one who is very aged.</p>  
<p>59. Sixteen years (after maturity is the period for appointing a widow);</p>  
<p>60. Nor (shall an appointment be made) if the (male entitled to approach the widow) is sickly.</p>  
<p>61. Let him approach (the widow) in the muh&ucirc;arta sacred to. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, (behaving) like a husband, without (amorously) dallying with her, and without abusing or ill-treating her.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_527"></A><A HREF="#fn_527"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A></p>  
<p>62. Let her obtain (the expenses for) food, raiment, baths, and unguents from (the estate of) her former (husband).</p>  
<p>63. They declare that a son begotten on (a widow who has) not been (duly) appointed, belongs to the begetter.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_528"></A><A HREF="#fn_528"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A></p>

<p>64. If she was (appointed, the child belongs) to both the males connected with the appointment.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_529"></A><A HREF="#fn_529"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A></p>  
<p>65. No appointment (shall be made) through a desire to obtain the estate.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_530"></A><A HREF="#fn_530"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A></p>  
<p>66. Some say, 'Or, one may appoint (a widow out of covetousness), after imposing a penance.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_531"></A><A HREF="#fn_531"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A></p>  
<p>67, A maiden who has attained puberty shall wait for three years.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_532"></A><A HREF="#fn_532"><FONT SIZE="1">67</FONT></A></p>  
<p>68. After three years (have passed), she may take a. husband of equal caste.</p>  
<p>69. Now they quote also (the following verses) But if through a father's negligence a maiden is here given away after the suitable age has passed, she who was waiting (for a husband) destroys him who gives her away, just as the fee which is paid too late to the teacher (destroys the pupil).'</p>  
<p>70. 'Out of fear of the appearance of the menses let the father marry his daughter while she still runs about naked. For if she stays (in the house) after the age of puberty, sin falls on the father.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_533"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_92"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 92</FONT></A></p>  
<p>71. 'As often as the courses of a maiden, who is filled with desire, and demanded in marriage by men of equal caste, recur, so often her father and her mother are guilty of (the crime of) slaying an embryo; that is a rule of the sacred law.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_534"></A><A HREF="#fn_534"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A></p>  
<p>72. 'If the betrothed of a maiden die after she has been promised to him verbally, and by (a libation of) water, but before she was married with (the recitation of) sacred texts, she belongs to her father alone.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_535"></A><A HREF="#fn_535"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A></p>  
<p>73. 'If a damsel has been abducted by force, and not been wedded with sacred texts, she may lawfully be given to another man; she is even like a maiden.'</p>  
<p>74. 'If a damsel at the death of her husband had been merely wedded by (the recitation of) sacred texts, and if the marriage had not been consummated, she may be married again.'</p>  
<p>75. The wife of an emigrant shall wait for five years.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_536"></A><A HREF="#fn_536"><FONT SIZE="1">75</FONT></A></p>  
<p>76. After five years (have passed), she may go (to seek) her husband.</p>  
<p>77. If for reasons connected with spiritual or with money matters she be unwilling to leave her home, she must act in the same manner as if (her husband were) dead.</p>  
<p>78. In this manner a wife of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a caste who has issue (shall wait) five years, and one who has no issue, four years; a wife of the Kshatriya caste who has issue, five years, and one who has no issue, three years; a wife of the Vai<I>s</I>ya caste who</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_93"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 93</FONT></A></p>  
<p>has issue, four years, and one who has no issue, two years; a wife of the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra caste who has issue, three years, and one who has no issue, one year.</p>  
<p>79. After that among those who are united (with her husband) in interest, or by birth, or by the funeral cake, or by libations of water, or by descent from the same family, each earlier named person is more venerable than the following ones.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_537"></A><A HREF="#fn_537"><FONT SIZE="1">79</FONT></A></p>  
<p>80. But while a member of her family is living, she shall certainly not go to a stranger.</p>  
<p>81. Let the Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as or the subsidiary sons divide the heritage of him who has no heir of the first-mentioned six kinds.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_538"></A><A HREF="#fn_538"><FONT SIZE="1">81</FONT></A></p>  
<p>82. On failure of them the spiritual teacher and a pupil shall take the inheritance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_539"></A><A HREF="#fn_539"><FONT SIZE="1">82</FONT></A></p>  
<p>83. On failure of those two the king inherits.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_540"></A><A HREF="#fn_540"><FONT SIZE="1">83</FONT></A></p>  
<p>84. But let the king not take (the estate) of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>85. For the property of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is a terrible poison.</p>  
<p>86. 'Poison they do not call the (worst) poison; the property of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is said to be the (most destructive) poison. Poison destroys only one person, but the property of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (him who takes it) together with sons and grandsons.'</p>

The curious fact that Vasish<I>th</I>a here calls the appointed daughter a son may perhaps be explained by a custom which, though rarely practised, still occurs in Ka<I>s</I>m&icirc;r, and by which a brotherless maiden is given a male name. A historical instance of this kind is mentioned in the R&acirc;<I>g</I>atara&#7749;gi<I>n</I>&icirc;, where it is stated that Kaly&acirc;<I>n</I>adev&icirc;, princess of Gau<I>d</I>a and wife of king <I>G</I>ay&acirc;p&icirc;<I>d</I>a, was called by her father Kaly&acirc;<I>n</I>amalla. When I collated this passage with the help of a Ka<I>s</I>m&icirc;rian, I was told that a certain Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, still living in <I>S</I>rinagar, had changed the <A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A> name of his only child, a daughter called Amr&icirc;, to the corresponding masculine form, Amar<I>g</I>&ucirc;, in order to secure to himself through her the same spiritual benefits as if he had a son. It seems to me not improbable that Vasish<I>th</I>a's S&ucirc;tra alludes to the same legal fiction, and that he recommends in the first instance that the father is to make his daughter a son by changing her name, and next to secure for himself her son, by the verse quoted S&ucirc;tra 17.</P>
