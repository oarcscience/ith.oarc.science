13\. Husked rice (which has been defiled must be) thrown away. <span

14\. The same (rule applies) to cooked sacrificial viands. <span
id="fr_954"></span>[14](#fn_954.md)

15\. But if a great quantity has been defiled by (the touch of) dogs,
crows, and the like (unclean beings), one must throw away that portion
(as) food for men, and sprinkle (the rest with water), reciting the

the proper time are conflicting, each earlier-named (point) is more
important (than the following ones). <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_949"></span>[190:8](sbe1447.htm#fr_949.md) **14**. A great
river, i.e. one which directly flows into the ocean.--Govinda.

<span id="fn_950"></span>[190:9](sbe1447.htm#fr_950.md) A Vinâ*l*a, i.e. (a
vessel) made of bamboo or Vidagdha*n*a*l*a; it s called a 'long vessel'
(dirghabhâ*g*anam), and is used for carrying he Pra*n*îta water and the
like purposes.--Govinda. The vessel <span id="page_191">p. 191</span>
intended is no doubt the flask made of a bamboo which is cut below the
joint, and is commonly used as a bottle for oil. Govinda adds that this
mode of purification is to be adopted in case the vessels have been
touched by impure persons.

<span id="fn_951"></span>[191:10](sbe1447.htm#fr_951.md) Na*l*a-reeds, i.e.
Amphidonax Karka; *S*ara, i.e. Saccharum Sara. Govinda says that the
rule applies to cases where such implements have been defiled by
remnants of food (u*kkh*ish*t*alepa).

<span id="fn_952"></span>[191:11](sbe1447.htm#fr_952.md) 'Defiled, i.e.
touched by a *K*a*nd*âla.' (The rule) refers to a quantity less than a
Dro*n*a (66 or 132 lbs.).--Govinda.

<span id="fn_953"></span>[191:13](sbe1447.htm#fr_953.md) 'If it has been
defiled by urine and the like and the quantity is small;' this must be
understood, because he will declare (below, Sûtra 15) that if there is a
great quantity (the defiled) portion only shall be thrown
away.--Govinda.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[191:14](sbe1447.htm#fr_954.md) This, too, refers
to small quantities only.

<span id="fn_955"></span>[191:15](sbe1447.htm#fr_955.md) The Anuvâka
referred to is Taittirîya-brâhma*n*a I, 4, 8.

<span id="fn_956"></span>[191:16](sbe1447.htm#fr_956.md) 'Hydromel, i.e.
sour milk, honey, clarified butter, water, and <span id="page_192">p.
192</span> grain; a preparation of milk, i.e. curd of two-milk whey
(âmikshâ), if these are blemished by the fault of men, and that (blemish
must have been caused by) the touch of an impure (person, u*kkh*ish*t*a)
only.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_957"></span>[192:17](sbe1447.htm#fr_957.md) 'And that must be
done in such a manner that the oil and the clarified butter are not
lost.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_958"></span>[192:18](sbe1447.htm#fr_958.md) 'Any impure
substance, i.e. urine, ordure, and the like.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_959"></span>[192:19](sbe1447.htm#fr_959.md) Âv*ri*t,' the
series of actions,' i.e. the growth (prâ*ms*ubhâva) of the ceremonial
(prayoga).--Govinda.
