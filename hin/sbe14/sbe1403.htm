<p>THE case of the Baudh&acirc;yana Dharma-s&ucirc;tra is in many respects analogous to that of the Institutes of the Sacred Law, current in the schools of &Acirc;pastamba and Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in. Like the latter, it is the work of a teacher of the Black Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, who composed manuals on all the various subdivisions of the Kalpa, and founded a S&ucirc;tra-<I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>a, which is said to exist to the present day&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The Br&acirc;hmanical tradition, too, acknowledges these facts, and, instead of surrounding Baudh&acirc;yana's work with a halo of myths, simply states that it was originally studied by and authoritative for the followers of the Taittir&icirc;ya-veda alone, and later only became one of the sources of the Sacred Law for all Br&acirc;hmans&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Moreover, the position of Baudh&acirc;yana among the teachers of the Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda is well defined, and his home, or at least the home of his school, is known. But here the resemblance stops. For while the S&ucirc;tras of &Acirc;pastamba-and Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in have been preserved in care-fully and methodically arranged collections, where a certain place is assigned to each section of the Kalpa, no complete set of the Sutras of Baudh&acirc;yana's school has, as yet; been found, and the original position of the detached portions which are obtainable is not quite certain. Again, while the works of &Acirc;pastamba and Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in seem to have been kept free from extensive interpolations, several parts of</p>

<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Baudh&acirc;yana's S&ucirc;tras have clearly received considerable additions from later hands.</p>  
<p>According to the researches of Dr. A. Burnell&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, whose long residence in Southern India and intimate acquaintance with its Br&acirc;hmanical libraries have made him the first authority on the literature of the schools of the Taittir&icirc;ya-veda, the S&ucirc;tras of Baudh&acirc;yana consist of six sections, viz. 1. the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras, probably in nineteen Pra<I>s</I>nas; 2. The Karm&acirc;nta-s&ucirc;tra in twenty Adhy&acirc;yas; 3. The Dvaidha-s&ucirc;tra in four Pra<I>s</I>nas; 4. The G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra in four Pra<I>s</I>nas; 5. The Dharma-s&ucirc;tra in four Pra<I>s</I>nas; 6. The <I>S</I>ulva-s&ucirc;tra in three Adhy&acirc;yas. The results of the search for Sanskrit MSS. in other parts of India, and especially in Western India, do not differ materially from those obtained by Dr. Burnell. The G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra, which in Western India occasionally bears the title Sm&acirc;rta-s&ucirc;tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, contains, however, nine instead of four Pra<I>s</I>nas. The MSS. of the Baudh&acirc;yana-s&ucirc;tras, which contain the text alone, are all incomplete, mostly very corrupt and in bad order, and rarely give more than a small number of Pra<I>s</I>nas on detached subjects. The copies in which the text is accompanied by a commentary are in a better condition. Thus the Kalpavivara<I>n</I>a of Bhavasv&acirc;min&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> extends over the whole of the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra, and over the Karm&acirc;nta and the Dvaidha-s&ucirc;tras. It shows the proper sequence of the Pra<I>s</I>nas on <I>S</I>rauta sacrifices, and that probably the Karm&acirc;nta and the Dvaidha immediately followed the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra. But there is no hint in the MSS. or in the commentaries how the G<I>ri</I>hya, Dharma, and <I>S</I>ulva-s&ucirc;tras were originally placed. With respect to these sections, it is only possible to judge from the analogy of the other extant sets of Kalpa-s&ucirc;tras</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and from internal evidence. On these grounds it may be shown that the order, adopted by Dr. Burnell, is probably the correct one. For the beginning of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> shows by its wording that it was not a separate treatise, but was immediately connected with some preceding Pra<I>s</I>na. The analogy of the collections of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas, the Haira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>as, the Ka<I>th</I>as, and other schools permits us to infer that it stood after the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra. It is further clear that, in its turn, it was succeeded by the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. For two passages of the latter work, 1, 2, 3, 15, and II, 8, 15, 9, clearly contain references to the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra. In the former, the author gives the rule regarding the length of the staff to be carried by a student, as well as the general principle that the staff must be cut from a tree fit for sacrificial purposes. With respect to the latter clause he adds that the details have been given above.' As the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra contains nothing more on this subject, it follows that the expression 'above' must refer to G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra II, 7, where the usual detailed rules regarding the employment of particular woods for the several var<I>n</I>as are given. In the second passage Baudh&acirc;yana says that the rules for the performance of funeral sacrifices have been fully explained in the section on the Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc;homa, which occurs G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra II, 17-18. It is, therefore, perfectly certain that Baudh&acirc;yana, just like &Acirc;pastamba, placed the Pra<I>s</I>nas on the Sacred Law after those on the domestic ceremonies, and that the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra was not a separate work. Under these circumstances it becomes highly probable that the <I>S</I>ulva-s&ucirc;tra formed, as is the case in other sets of Kalpa-s&ucirc;tras, the conclusion of the whole. Thus the only treatise, whose position remains doubtful, is the Pravarakha<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, the list of the Br&acirc;hmanical gotras and of their deified ancestors&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Possibly it may have stood at the end of the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The destruction of the continuity of Baudh&acirc;yana's Kalpa-s&ucirc;tra has had the consequence which is commonly observable in other dismembered works, that several of its detached portions have received considerable additions from later and, as it would seem, from several hands. There can be no doubt that a small portion only of the nine Pra<I>s</I>nas, found in the Western copies of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra, really belongs to Baudh&acirc;yana. For the description of the G<I>ri</I>hya rites, which strictly follows the general plan laid down in the first S&ucirc;tra, is completed in two or three Pra<I>s</I>nas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Next follows a Pra<I>s</I>na on the anuk<I>ri</I>tis, rites resembling those comprised in the subdivisions treated before, and then a Pra<I>s</I>na on pr&acirc;ya<I>s</I><I>k</I>ittas, or expiations of mistakes committed during, and of the neglect of, the performance of the G<I>ri</I>hya-karm&acirc;<I>n</I>i. The remaining Pra<I>s</I>nas are filled with a medley of paribh&acirc;sh&acirc;s, general rules, and of full descriptions of ceremonies, some of which have been given before, while others are added afresh. Many of the newly-added rites do not belong to the ancient Br&acirc;hmanical worship, but to the Paur&acirc;nic religions, the service of <I>S</I>iva, Skanda, N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, and other deities, and some show an admixture of T&acirc;ntric elements. In some of the later Pra<I>s</I>nas, especially IV and V, the language closely resembles that of the first three, and shows the same stereotyped phrases and the same Vedic anomalous forms. But in other sections, particularly VI-IX, we find, instead of S&ucirc;tras, the common Anush<I>t</I>ubh <I>S</I>loka throughout, and expressions peculiar to the metrical Sm<I>ri</I>tis and the Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as. At the end of most Adhy&acirc;yas we read the phrase, ity &acirc;ha Baudh&acirc;yana<I>h</I>, or bhagav&acirc;n Baudh&acirc;yana<I>h</I>, 'thus speaks Baudh&acirc;yana, or the divine Baudh&acirc;yana.' Finally, while the first three Pra<I>s</I>nas are divided into Ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>ik&acirc;s or Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, the following ones consist of Adhy&acirc;yas or chapters. These differences, as well as the fact that the most important G<I>ri</I>hya rites, arranged according to a special plan, are done with in the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxiii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxiii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>first three Pra<I>s</I>nas, necessarily lead to the conclusion that the whole remainder does not belong to Baudh&acirc;yana, but consists of so-called Pari<I>s</I>ish<I>t</I>as, which were composed by the adherents of his school. Further, the fact that the last six Pra<I>s</I>nas do not show everywhere the same style and language, makes it probable that the additions were made at different times and by different persons.</p>  
<p>The Dharma-s&ucirc;tra seems to have undergone exactly the same fate as the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra. It will be obvious even to the readers of the translation that its fourth Pra<I>s</I>na is a later addition. It consists of two parts. The first, which ends with the fourth Adhy&acirc;ya, treats of penances, both public and secret ones. The second, Adhy&acirc;yas 5-8, describes the means of obtaining siddhi, the fulfilment of one's desires, and recommends for this purpose the offering of the Ga<I>n</I>ahomas after a previous sanctification of the worshipper by means of a course of austerities. The first part is perfectly superfluous, as the subject of penances has already been discussed in the first sections of the second Pra<I>s</I>na, and again in chapters 4-10 of the third Pra<I>s</I>na. Its rules sometimes contradict those given before, and in other cases, e<I>g</I>. IV, 2, 10-12, are mere repetitions of previous statements. The introduction of the means of gaining siddhi, on the other hand, is without a parallel in other Dharma-s&ucirc;tras, and the subject is entirely foreign to the scope of such works. Its treatment, too, shows that chapters 5-8 do not belong to the author of the bulk of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. For the description of the preparatory 'restraints' or austerities contains somewhat more detailed rules for a number of penances, e.g. the K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ras and the <I>K</I>&acirc;ndr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, which have already been described in the preceding Pra<I>s</I>nas. Moreover, the style and the language of the whole fourth Pra<I>s</I>na are very different from those of the three preceding ones, and the differences observable are exactly the same as those between the first five and the last four Pra<I>s</I>nas of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra. The epic <I>S</I>loka nearly throughout replaces the aphoristic prose, and the common slipshod Sanskrit of the Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as appears instead of the archaic forms. Finally, the fourth Pra<I>s</I>na is divided into</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxiv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxiv</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Adhy&acirc;yas, not into the Ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>ik&acirc;s or Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as and Adhy&acirc;yas which are found in the first two Pra<I>s</I>nas.</p>  
<p>This latter peculiarity is also observable in the third Pra<I>s</I>na, and raises a suspicion against the genuineness of that part also. For, though the third Pra<I>s</I>na in style and language resembles the first two, it is hard to believe that the author should, for no apparent reason, suddenly have changed the manner of dividing his work towards its end. This suspicion is further strengthened by two other circumstances. First, Pra<I>s</I>nas I-II really exhaust the discussion of the whole Dharma, and the third offers supplementary information only on some points which have been touched upon previously. Secondly, several Adhy&acirc;yas of Pra<I>s</I>na III seem to have been borrowed from other works, or to be abstracts from them. Thus the tenth chapter has certainly been taken from the Gautam&icirc;ya Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra, the sixth bears a very close and suspicious resemblance to Vish<I>n</I>u XLVIII&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and the third looks very much like a short summary of the doctrine of Vikhanas, whose lost S&ucirc;tra contained the original rule of the order of the Vaikh&acirc;nasas or hermits, living in the forest. These circumstances justify, it seems to me, the assumption that Baudh&acirc;yana's original Dharma-s&ucirc;tra consisted, like &Acirc;pastamba's, of two Pra<I>s</I>nas only, and that it received, through followers of his school, two separate additions, first in very ancient times Pra<I>s</I>na III, where the style of the master is strictly followed, and later Pra<I>s</I>na IV, where the language and phraseology of the metrical Sm<I>ri</I>tis are adopted. It ought to be noted that Govindasv&acirc;min, too, does not take the whole of the four Pra<I>s</I>nas for Baudh&acirc;yana's composition. With respect to several passages&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> where Baudh&acirc;yana's name is introduced in order to give weight to the rules, he says that the S&ucirc;tras may belong to 'a pupil.' I do not think that the criterion which he uses can be relied on in every case, because oriental authors without doubt occasionally speak of themselves as of third</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>persons. But the fact that the commentator, though an orthodox Hindu, had misgivings as to the genuineness of portions of the work, is not without significance. It seems also that even the first two Pra<I>s</I>nas are not quite free from interpolations. Thus the Ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>ik&acirc;s on the Tarpa<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are certainly much enlarged by additions, the verse at I, 5, 11, 36, a repetition of I, 5, 9, 5, and some prose quotations which are introduced by the words ath&acirc;py ud&acirc;haranti, 'now they quote also,' standing usually before verses only, are at least suspicious. That the genuineness of many single passages should be doubtful, is no more than might be expected, not only on account of the separation of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra from the other parts of the Kalpa, but also because the work, as we shall see further on, remained for a long time without the protection of a commentary. The practical conclusion to be drawn from this state of things is that the greatest caution must be observed in using the Baudh&acirc;yana Dharma-s&ucirc;tra for historical purposes, and that it will be advisable to draw no inferences regarding Baudh&acirc;yana's relation to other teachers and schools from the last two Pra<I>s</I>nas, and not to trust too much to historical inferences drawn from single passages of the first two.</p>  
<p>The position which Baudh&acirc;yana occupies among the teachers of the Taittir&icirc;ya-veda has already been discussed in the Introduction to &Acirc;pastamba. It has been shown that according to the Br&acirc;hmanical tradition preserved by Mah&acirc;deva, the commentator of the Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>i-s&ucirc;tras, he composed the first S&ucirc;tra for the followers of his <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;. Internal and external evidence has also been adduced, proving that he certainly was more ancient than &Acirc;pastamba and Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in. It is now possible to bring forward some further facts bearing on these points. First, in the section on the Tarpa<I>n</I>a, the libations of water offered to various deities, <I>Ri</I>shis, and the manes, II, 5, 9, 14, K&acirc;<I>n</I>va Baudh&acirc;yana receives his share immediately after the <I>Ri</I>shis of the Veda and before &Acirc;pastamba, the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra, and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxvi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxvi</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Saty&acirc;sh&acirc;<I>dh</I>a Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in. The same order is observed in the distribution of the offerings at the Sarpabali, described in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, where the following teachers of the Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda are specially named, viz. Vai<I>s</I>amp&acirc;yana, Phuli&#7749;gu, Tittiri, Ukha, Aukhya, &Acirc;treya the author of the Pada-text, Kau<I>n</I><I>d</I>inya the author of the commentary, K&acirc;<I>n</I>va Baudh&acirc;yana the author of the Prava<I>k</I>ana, &Acirc;pastamba the author of the S&ucirc;tra, and Saty&acirc;sh&acirc;<I>dh</I>a Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in. Neither of these two passages belongs to Baudh&acirc;yana. They are both clearly interpolations. But they show that Mah&acirc;deva's statement, which makes Baudh&acirc;yana the first expounder of the Kalpa among the Taittir&icirc;yavedins, agrees with the tradition of the Baudh&acirc;yan&icirc;yas themselves. For not only the place allotted to Baudh&acirc;yana's name, but still more the title Prava<I>k</I>anak&acirc;ra which he receives, show that the followers of his school placed him before and above all other teachers of the ritual. The term prava<I>k</I>ana, which literally means 'proclaiming or recitation,' has frequently the technical sense of 'oral instruction,' and is applied both to the traditional lore contained in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, and to the more systematic teaching of the A&#7749;gas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. If, therefore, a teacher is called the author of the Prava<I>k</I>ana of a <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;, that can only mean that he is something more than a common S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra, and is considered to be the originator of the whole 'system of instruction among its followers. The epithet K&acirc;<I>n</I>va, which Baudh&acirc;yana receives in both the passages quoted above, indicates that he belonged to the Vedic Gotra of the Ka<I>n</I>vas. It deserves to be noted that Govindasv&acirc;min, too, on I, 3, 5, 13, explains the name Baudh&acirc;yana by K&acirc;<I>n</I>v&acirc;yana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxvii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxvii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The style of Baudh&acirc;yana's works furnishes, as Dr. Burnell has pointed out&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, another argument for their high antiquity. Compared with the S&ucirc;tras of &Acirc;pastamba and Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in they are much simpler in their arrangement, and the complete absence of that anxiety to save 'half a vowel' which characterises the fully developed S&ucirc;tra-style is very remarkable. The last point has been noticed by Govindasv&acirc;min also. In commenting on I, 2, 3, 17-18, where Baudh&acirc;yana first permits students to beg food of men of all castes, and afterwards explains that he means &Acirc;ryans who follow their lawful occupations, he says&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, '(If anybody should ask), "Why give two S&ucirc;tras, while one S&ucirc;tra, ('A student shall ask) &Acirc;ryans who follow their lawful occupations,' would have sufficed?" (his objection will be) correct. For this teacher is not particularly anxious to make his book short.' In other cases we find a certain awkwardness in the distribution of the subject matter, which probably finds its explanation through the fact that Baudh&acirc;yana first attempted to- bring the teaching of the Taittir&icirc;yas on the Dharma into a systematic form. Thus the rules on the law of inheritance are given without any apparent necessity and against the custom of the other S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ras in two different chapters, I, 5, 11, 9-16 and II, 2, 3, 1-44. The section on purification, too, is divided into two separate portions, I, 4, 6-10 and I, 6, 13-15, and the second which treats of the purification of the vessels at sacrifices, properly ought to have been placed into the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra, not into the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. Again, the discussion of several topics is repeatedly interrupted by the introduction of rules belonging to different subjects, and Govindasv&acirc;min's ingenuity is often taxed to the utmost in order to find the reason why certain S&ucirc;tras which apparently</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxviii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxviii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>are unconnected with the main subject have been inserted. A third argument for the great antiquity of Baudh&acirc;yana's S&ucirc;tras, derived from the archaic character of some of his doctrines, has been discussed in the Introduction to &Acirc;pastamba&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The number of instances where Baudh&acirc;yana's rules are based on a more ancient order of ideas than &Acirc;pastamba's might be increased very considerably. But, as now the comparison of the two works is open to all students, I omit the cases contained in the two Dharma-s&ucirc;tras, and content myself with adducing one more from the less accessible G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras. It is a well-known fact that the ancient Vedic ritual in certain cases admitted <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras, and particularly the Rathak&acirc;ra or carpenter, who, according to all accounts, has <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra blood in his veins, to a participation in the <I>S</I>rauta rites. The Taittir&icirc;ya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a even gives certain Mantras to be recited by the Rathak&acirc;ra at the Agny&acirc;dh&acirc;na sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Now Baudh&acirc;yana, who, Dh. S. I, 9, 17, 6, derives the origin of the Rathak&acirc;ras from a Vai<I>s</I>ya male and <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra female, apparently reckons him amongst the twice-born, and explicitly allows him to receive the sacrament of the initiation. He says, G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra II, 5, 8-9, 'Let him initiate a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a in spring; a Kshatriya in summer, a Vai<I>s</I>ya in autumn, a Rathak&acirc;ra in the rainy season; or all of them in spring&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.' But &Acirc;pastamba, who shows great hostility against the mixed castes, and emphatically denies the right of <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras to be initiated, gives the same rule regarding the seasons for the initiation both in his G<I>ri</I>hya and Dharma-s&ucirc;tras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. He, however, omits the Rathak&acirc;ra in both cases. There can be no doubt that &Acirc;pastamba's exclusion of the carpenter, which agrees with the sentiments prevailing in modern Br&acirc;hmanical society, is an off-shoot of a later doctrine, and as both he and Baudh&acirc;yana</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p><A NAME="page_xxxix"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxix</FONT></A></p>  
<p>belong to the same vidy&acirc;va<I>m</I>sa, or spiritual family, this difference may be used as an argument for his posteriority to Baudh&acirc;yana. In connexion with this rule of Baudh&acirc;yana's it ought to be mentioned that even in the present day certain subdivisions of the modern Sut&acirc;rs or carpenters actually wear the Br&acirc;hmanical thread, and, in spite of the adverse teaching of the <I>S</I>&acirc;stras, find Br&acirc;hmans willing to perform the ceremony of investiture for them.</p>  
<p>While it thus appears not incredible that Baudh&acirc;yana really was the first S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra of the Taittir&icirc;yas, the numerous quotations which his works contain, permit us to form an idea of the extent of the Vedic and profane literature known to him. Among the Vedic works which he adduces as authorities, or otherwise refers to, the three sections of the Taittir&icirc;ya-veda, the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, and the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, naturally take the first place. For the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka he seems to have used the Andhra version, as Dh. S. II, 10, 18, 7, 11 references to the seventy-first Anuv&acirc;ka of the tenth Prap&acirc;<I>th</I>aka occur. Two long passages, Dh. S. I, 2, 4, 3-8; II, 6, 11, 1-8, which apparently have been taken from the <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, testify to his acquaintance with the White Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda. Baudh&acirc;yana does not say expressly that he quotes from the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyins, but Govinda has no hesitation in pointing to the <I>S</I>atapatha as their source. It is remarkable that the fact noticeable in &Acirc;pastamba's quotation from the <I>S</I>atapatha reappears here, and that the wording of the two quotations does not fully agree with the printed text of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. The differences in the first passage are, no doubt, partly owing to corruptions and interpolations in Baudh&acirc;yana's text; but that cannot be said of the second&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. References to the S&acirc;ma-veda and the S&acirc;mans occur repeatedly, and the passage from the Nid&acirc;na of Bh&acirc;llavins regarding the geographical extent of true Br&acirc;hmanical</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_xl"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xl</FONT></A></p>  
<p>learning, which Vasish<I>th</I>a adduces, is given I, 1, 2, 11-12. From the Rig-veda a few expiatory hymns and verses, such as the Aghamarsha<I>n</I>a and the Taratsamand&icirc;s, are quoted. The Atharva-veda is not referred to by name, but the existence of &Acirc;tharva<I>n</I>a schools may be inferred from the mention made of the vows called <I>S</I>iras, II, 8, 14, 2. Among the authorities on the Sacred Law, mentioned in the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, K&acirc;tya I, 2, 3, 46, Maudgalya II, 2, 4, 8, and Aupa<I>g</I>andhani II, 2, 3,33, do not occur in other works of the same class&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. H&acirc;r&icirc;ta, who is mentioned II, 1, 2, 21, and who probably was a teacher of the Maitr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya school, is named by Vasish<I>th</I>a and &Acirc;pastamba also. The Gautama who is quoted I, 1, 2, 7 and II, 2, 4, 17, is, as has been shown in the Introduction to Gautama, most probably the author of the still existing Institutes of Gautama. To the arguments for the latter view, adduced there, I may add that two other passages of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, II, 6, 15 and 26, point to a close connexion between Baudh&acirc;yana's and Gautama's works. The former of the two Sutras contains, with the exception of one small clause in the beginning, exactly the same description of the duties of a hermit in the forest as that given by Gautama III, 26-35. The second Sutra states, just as Gautama's rule III, 36, that the venerable teacher (&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ry&acirc;<I>h</I>) prescribes one order only, that of the householders. The reason given for this opinion differs, however, according to Baudh&acirc;yana, from that adduced in Gautama's text. The almost literal identity of the first long passage makes it not improbable that Baudh&acirc;yana borrowed in this instance also from Gautama without noting the source from which he drew. On the other hand, the argument drawn from the fact that the tenth Adhy&acirc;ya of Pra<I>s</I>na III has been taken from Gautama's S&ucirc;tra loses its force since, as I have shown above, it is improbable that the third Pra<I>s</I>na formed part of Baudh&acirc;yana's</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_xli"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xli</FONT></A></p>  
<p>original work. A metrical work on the Sacred Law seems to be quoted II, 2, 4, 14-15. For, as the second verse, adduced there, says that the penance for one who violated his Guru's bed has been declared above, it seems impossible to assume that the two <I>S</I>lokas belonged to the versified maxims of the Dharma current among the learned Br&acirc;hmans. If this quotation is not an interpolation, it proves that, side by side with the Dharma-sutras, metrical treatises on the Sacred Law existed in very early times&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. One quotation, finally, which gives a verse from the dialogue of the daughters of U<I>s</I>anas and V<I>ri</I>shaparvan seems to have been taken from an epic poem. The verse is actually found in the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata I, 78, 10, and again 34, where the altercation between Sarmish<I>th</I>&acirc; and Devay&acirc;n&icirc; forms part of the Yay&acirc;tyup&acirc;khy&acirc;na. Considering what has been said above regarding the state of the text of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, and our imperfect knowledge of the history of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, it would be hazardous to assert that the verse proves Baudh&acirc;yana's acquaintance with Vy&acirc;sa's great epic. It will be safer to wait for further proofs that it was known to the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ras, before one bases far-going speculations on this hitherto solitary quotation.</p>  
<p>The arguments which maybe brought forward to show that Baudh&acirc;yana's home lay in Southern India are not as strong as those which permit us to determine the native country of &Acirc;pastamba. The portions of the Sutras, known to me, contain no direct mention of the south except in the de<I>s</I>anir<I>n</I>aya or disquisition on the countries, Dharma-s&ucirc;tra I, 1, 2, where certain peculiar customs of the southern Br&acirc;hmans are enumerated, and some districts of Southern India, e<I>g</I>. Kali&#7749;ga, are referred to as barbarous countries which must not be visited by &Acirc;ryans. These utterances show an acquaintance with the south, but by no means prove that Baudh&acirc;yana lived there. A more significant fact is that Baudh&acirc;yana declares, I, 1, 2, 4, 'going to sea' to be a custom prevailing among the northern Br&acirc;hmans, and afterwards, II, I, 22, places that act at the head of the Patan&icirc;yas,</p>  
<p>

<p>the more serious offences causing loss of caste. It is probable that by the latter rule he wished to show his stand-point as a southerner. But the most conclusive argument in favour of the southern origin of the Baudh&acirc;yan&icirc;yas is that they, like the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas and all other adherents of the Taittir&icirc;ya schools, are entirely confined to the Dekhan, and are not found among the indigenous subdivisions of the Br&acirc;hmans in Central and Northern India. This fact is, if not explicitly stated, at least implied by the passage of the Mah&acirc;r<I>n</I>ava quoted in the Introduction to &Acirc;pastamba&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It is proved by the present state of things, and by the evidence of the land grants of the southern dynasties, several of which have been made in favour of Baudh&acirc;yan&icirc;yas. Thus we find a grant of Bukkar&acirc;ya, the well-known ruler of Vi<I>g</I>ayanagara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, dated Sakasa<I>m</I>vat 1276 or 1354-5 A<I>D</I>., in which a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, studying the Baudh&acirc;yan&icirc;ya-s&ucirc;tra, is mentioned as the donee of a village in Mais&ucirc;r. Again, in an inscription of Nandivarman Pallavamalla, which its editor, the Rev. Mr. Foulkes, places in the ninth century A D.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, a considerable number of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as of the Prava<I>k</I>ana-s&ucirc;tra are named as recipients of the royal bounty, together with some followers of the &Acirc;pastambha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> school. As we have seen that Baudh&acirc;yana is called in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra the Prava<I>k</I>anak&acirc;ra, it is not doubtful that the Prava<I>k</I>ana-s&ucirc;tra of this inscription is the S&ucirc;tra of his school. The villages which the grantees received from Nandivarman were situated on the P&acirc;l&acirc;r river in the <I>K</I>itt&ucirc;r districts of the Madras Presidency. Besides, the interesting tradition which asserts that M&acirc;dhava-S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, the great commentator of the Vedas, was a Baudh&acirc;yan&icirc;ya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> is another point which may be brought forward as evidence for the location of the school in Southern India. Further,</p>

<p>it must not be forgotten that most and the best MSS. of Baudh&acirc;yana's S&ucirc;tras are found in Southern India. There are also some faint indications that the Andhra country is the particular district to which Baudh&acirc;yana belonged. For his repeated references to voyages by sea and his rule regarding the duty payable on goods imported by sea show that he must have lived in a coast district where sea-borne trade flourished, and the fact that he uses the Andhra recension of the Taittir&icirc;ya &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka makes it probable that he was an inhabitant of the eastern coast.</p>  
<p>My estimate of the distance between Baudh&acirc;yana and &Acirc;pastamba and of that between the latter and the historical period of India has been given in the Introduction to &Acirc;pastamba, pp. xxii and xliii, and I have nothing further to add on that subject. The oldest witness for the existence of the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra of Baudh&acirc;yana is its commentator Bhavasv&acirc;min, whom Dr. Burnell places in the eighth century A. D. The Dharma-s&ucirc;tra is first quoted by Vi<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ne<I>s</I>vara, circiter 1080-1100 A<I>D</I>. Several of the passages adduced by him are, however, not traceable in the MSS.</p>  
<p>As regards the materials on which the translation is based, I had at my disposal six MSS. of the text and two copies of Govindasv&acirc;min's commentary, the Bodh&acirc;yan&icirc;ya-dharmavivara<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, one of which (C. I.) gives the text also. These MSS. belong to two chief groups, a northern and a southern one. The northern group contains two subdivisions. The first comprises (1) D., a MS. bought by me for the Government of Bombay at Ahmad&acirc;b&acirc;d (no. 6 of the Dekhan College collection of 1868-69), and about one hundred or one hundred and fifty years old; (2) P., an old MS. of my own collection, bought in 1865 at Pu<I>n</I>a; (3, 4) B. and Bh., two modern transcripts, made for me in Baroda and Bombay, Among these, D. alone is of real value, as P., B., and Bh. faithfully reproduce all its clerical errors and add a good many new ones. The second subdivision of the northern group is represented by K., a modern transcript, made for</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_xliv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xliv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the Government of Bombay at Kolh&acirc;pur in the southern Mar&acirc;<I>th</I>a country (Elphinstone College collection of 1867-68, Class VI, no. 2). The MSS. of the northern group, which give the vulgata current since the times of N&icirc;laka<I>n</I><I>th</I>a.(1650 A. D.) and Mitrami<I>s</I>ra (circiter 2 700 A. D.) in Western and Central India, can be easily recognised by the omission of the third Adhy&acirc;ya of Pra<I>s</I>na IV, and by their placing IV, 5, 1 b-25 after IV, 7, 7. One of the chief differences between K. and the other MSS. of the northern group is the omission of II, 5, 8, 4-II, 6, 11, 15 in the latter. The southern group of MSS. is formed by M., a slovenly Devan&acirc;gar&icirc; transcript of a Grantha MS., no. 610/1929 of the Madras Government collection&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and by the text of C. L, a Devan&acirc;gar&icirc; copy of the MS. of Govindasv&acirc;min's commentary, presented by Dr. Burnell to the India Office library&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, The second copy of the commentary, C. T., a Telugu paper MS. from Tanjore, I owe to the kindness of Dr. Burnell.</p>  
<p>As might be expected, on account of the southern origin of the Baudh&acirc;yan&icirc;ya school, M. gives on the whole the best form of the text. It also carefully marks the Ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>ik&acirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in the first two Pra<I>s</I>nas, ignoring the Adhy&acirc;yas altogether, and contains at the end of each Pra<I>s</I>na the first words of each Ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>ik&acirc;, beginning with the last and ending with the first, after the fashion which prevails in the MSS. of the Taittir&icirc;ya Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, and &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka. Very close to M. comes Govinda's copy, where, however, as in most northern MSS., the Adhy&acirc;yas alone are marked. It is, however, perfectly certain that in some very difficult passages, which are disfigured by ancient corruptions, he corrected the text conjecturally&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> In a certain number of cases the northern MSS. present better and older readings than M. and C. I.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Under these</p>

<p>circumstances it has not been possible to follow the commentary or M. throughout. Though they had to be made the basis, they had in many passages to be set aside in favour of readings of the northern group. In some cases I have also been obliged to make conjectural emendations, which have all been mentioned in the notes. Three S&ucirc;tras, I, 8, 16, 13-15, have been left untranslated, because the MSS. offer no safe basis for a conjectural restoration, and the commentary is defective.</p>  
<p>Govinda, who, as Dr. Burnell informs me, is said to be a modern writer, seems to have composed his vivara<I>n</I>a without the aid of older v<I>ri</I>ttis. Though he apparently was well acquainted with the writings belonging to the Taittir&icirc;ya-veda, with the ritual and with the common law-books, he has not succeeded in explaining all the really difficult passages. Sometimes he is clearly mistaken, and frequently he passes by in silence words or whole S&ucirc;tras, the sense or the general bearing of which is by no means certain. Though it would be ungrateful on my part to underrate the importance of his work for my translation, I cannot place him in the same rank with Haradatta, the commentator of &Acirc;pastamba and Gautama, and can only regret that no older commentary based on the living tradition of the Baudh&acirc;yan&icirc;yas has been available. If such a work were found, better readings and better explanations of many difficult passages would probably come to light. With the materials at my disposal the translation has been a work of some difficulty, and in trying to settle the text I have often experienced the feeling of insecurity which comes over the decipherer of a difficult inscription when the facsimiles are bad. The short Adhy&acirc;ya on adoption, given in the appendix to the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, has been taken from the Sm&acirc;rta or G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra. It does not belong to Baudh&acirc;yana, but is frequently quoted by the writers on civil law, who wrote in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries of our era.</p>
