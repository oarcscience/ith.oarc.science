<p>1. Now, therefore, the desire to know the sacred law for their welfare (should arise) in (initiated) men.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. He who knows and follows the (sacred law is called) a righteous man.</p>  
<p>3. He becomes most worthy of praise in this world and after death gains heaven.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>4. The sacred law has been settled by the revealed texts and by the tradition (of the sages).</p>  
<p>5. On failure of (rules given in) these (two sources) the practice of the <I>S</I>ish<I>t</I>as (has) authority.</p>  
<p>6. But he whose heart is free from desire (is called) a <I>S</I>ish<I>t</I>a.</p>  
<p>7. (Acts sanctioned by) the sacred law (are those) for which no (worldly) cause is perceptible.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>

The country of the &Acirc;ryas (&Acirc;ry&acirc;varta) lies to the east of the region where (the river Sarasvat&icirc;) disappears, to the west of the Black-forest, to the north of the P&acirc;rip&acirc;tra (mountains), to the south of the Him&acirc;laya.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>9. (According to others it lies to the south of the Him&acirc;laya) and to the north of the Vindhya range (being limited east and west by the two oceans).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>10. Acts productive of spiritual merit, and customs which (are approved of) in that country, must be everywhere acknowledged (as authoritative);</p>  
<p>11. But not different ones, (i.e. those) of (countries where) laws opposed (to those of &Acirc;ry&acirc;varta prevail).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>

<p>13. Others (state as) an alternative, that spiritual pre-eminence (is found) as far as the black antelope grazes.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>  
<p>14. Now the Bh&acirc;llavins quote also (the following) verse in the Nid&acirc;na:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A></p>

<p>the region where the sun rises,--as far as the black antelope wanders (between these two limits), so far spiritual pre-eminence (is found).</p>  
<p>16. 'Those religious acts which men, deeply versed in the knowledge of the three Vedas and acquainted with the sacred law, declare to be lawful, (are efficient) for purifying oneself and others.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_66"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>17. Manu has declared that the (peculiar) laws of countries, castes, and families (may be followed) in the absence of (rules of) the revealed texts.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>18. Sinful men are, he who sleeps at sunrise or at sunset, he who has deformed nails or black teeth, he whose younger brother was married first, he who married before his elder brother, the husband of a younger sister married before the elder, the husband of an elder sister whose younger sister was married first, he who extinguishes the sacred fires, (and) he who forgets the Veda through neglect of the daily recitation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></p>

<p>19. They state that there are five mortal sins. (mah&acirc;p&acirc;taka),</p>  
<p>20. (Viz. violating) a Guru's bed, drinking (the spirituous liquor called) sur&acirc;, slaying a learned Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, stealing the gold of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, and associating with outcasts,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>21. Either by (entering into) spiritual or matrimonial (connexion with them).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>  
<p>22. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He who during a year associates with an outcast becomes (likewise) an outcast; not by sacrificing for him, by teaching him or by (forming) a matrimonial (alliance with him), but by using the same carriage or seat.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A></p>  
<p>23. A minor offence causing loss of caste (&ucirc;pap&acirc;taka, is committed by him) who (after beginning an Agnihotra sacrifice) forsakes the sacred fires, and by him who offends a Guru, by an atheist, by him who takes his livelihood from atheists, and by him who sells the Soma (plant).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A></p>  
<p>24. Three wives (are permitted) to a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a according to the order of the castes, two to a Kshatriya, one to a Vai<I>s</I>ya and to a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A></p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>25. Some declare (that twice-born men may marry) even a female of the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra caste, like those (other wives), without (the recitation of) Vedic texts.</p>  
<p>26. Let him not act thus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A></p>  
<p>27. For in consequence of such (a marriage) the degradation of the family certainly ensues, and after death the loss of heaven.</p>  
<p>28. There are six marriage-rites,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A></p>  
<p>29. (Viz.) that of Brahman (br&acirc;hma), that of the gods (daiva), that of the <I>Ri</I>shis (&acirc;rsha), that of the Gandharvas (g&acirc;ndharva), that of the Kshatriyas (ksh&acirc;tra), and that of men (m&acirc;nusha).</p>  
<p>30. If the father, pouring out a libation of water, gives his (daughter) to a suitor, that (is called) the Brahma-rite&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A></p>  
<p>31. If (the father) gives his daughter, decking her with ornaments, to an officiating priest, whilst a sacrifice is being performed, that is called the Daiva-rite.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A></p>  
<p>32. And (if the father gives his daughter) for a cow and a bull, (that is called) the &Acirc;rsha-rite.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A></p>  
<p>33. If a lover takes a loving female of equal caste, that (is called) the G&acirc;ndharva-rite.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A></p>  
<p>34. If they forcibly abduct (a damsel), destroying (her relatives) by strength (of arms), that (is called) the Ksh&acirc;tra-rite.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A></p>  
<p>35. If, after making a bargain (with the father, a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A></p>

<p>suitor) marries (a damsel) purchased for money, that (is called) the M&acirc;nusha-rite.</p>  
<p>36. The purchase (of a wife) is mentioned in the following passage of the Veda, 'Therefore one hundred (cows) besides a chariot should be given to the father of the bride.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A></p>  
<p>37. (It is stated) in (the following passage of) the <I>K</I>&acirc;turm&acirc;syas, 'She (forsooth) who has been bought by her husband (commits sin, as) afterwards she unites herself with strangers.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A></p>  
<p>38. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Lost learning comes back; when the family is lost all is lost. Even a horse becomes estimable on account of its pedigree; therefore men marry wives descended from an (unblemished) family.</p>  
<p>39. The three (lower) castes shall live according to the teaching of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A></p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_8"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>40. The Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a shall declare their duties,</p>  
<p>41. And the king shall govern them accordingly.</p>  
<p>42. But a king who rules in accordance with the sacred law, may take the sixth part of the wealth (of his subjects),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A></p>  
<p>43. Except from Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A></p>  
<p>44. It has been declared in the Veda, 'But he obtains the sixth part of (the merit which Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as gain by) sacrifices and charitable works.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A></p>  
<p>45. (It is further stated in the Veda), 'The Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a makes the Veda rich; the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a saves from misfortune; therefore the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a shall not be made a source of subsistence. Soma is his king.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A></p>  
<p>46. Further (another passage says), 'After death bliss (awaits the king who does not oppress Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as).'</p>

It marks the beginning of the book, serves as an auspicious invocation (ma&#7749;gala), and indicates that something else, the initiation, must precede the study of the sacred law. 'Therefore' means 'because, after initiation, the neophyte is to be taught the prescribed rules regarding personal purification:--K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>apa<I>n</I><I>d</I>ita.

<P><A NAME="fn_58"></A><A HREF="sbe1404.htm#fr_58">1:7</A> The S&ucirc;tra contains a limitation of S&ucirc;tra 5. It indicates that the customs of the <I>S</I>ish<I>t</I>as, for which worldly motives are perceptible, have no authority, and are not to be followed. The principle enunciated is one inculcated by the M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>sakas (P: M. S. <A NAME="page_2"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 2</FONT></A> I, 3, 3-4). See also &Acirc;pastamba I, 1, 4, 5-10; I, 4, 12, 8; and Introduction, p. xxvii. K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>apa<I>n</I><I>d</I>ita has misunderstood the S&ucirc;tra. He reads, against the MSS., ag<I>ri</I>hyam&acirc;<I>n</I>ak&acirc;ra<I>n</I>o &#8217;dharma<I>h</I>, 'unlawful acts are those for which no motive, i.e. no sacred source such as the Vedas, is perceptible.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_59"></A><A HREF="sbe1404.htm#fr_59">2:8</A> The region where the river Sarasvat&icirc; disappears is the Patti&acirc;l&acirc; district in the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>&acirc;b. The P&acirc;rip&acirc;tra mountains belong to the great Vindhya range, and are probably the hills in M&acirc;lv&acirc;. The position of the K&acirc;lakavana or Black-forest is not accurately known. But it must probably be sought in Bih&acirc;r. All the MSS. as well as K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>apa<I>n</I><I>d</I>ita read in this S&ucirc;tra pr&acirc;g&acirc;dar<I>s</I>an&acirc;t instead of pr&acirc;gadar<I>s</I>an&acirc;t, 'to the east of the region where the river Sarasvat&icirc; disappears.' This circumstance gains some importance by the fact that the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;shya on P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini II, 4, 10, quotes the same definition of the &Acirc;ry&acirc;varta, giving, however, instead of adar<I>s</I>an&acirc;t pr&acirc;g&acirc;dar<I>s</I>&acirc;t, 'to the east of &Acirc;dar<I>s</I>a, i.e. the &Acirc;dar<I>s</I>a mountains.' It seems to me not improbable that our S&ucirc;tra, too, had originally pr&acirc;g&acirc;dar<I>s</I>&acirc;t, and that some Pa<I>n</I><I>d</I>it who knew nothing about the &Acirc;dar<I>s</I>a hills, but remembered Manu II, as, and Baudh&acirc;yana I, 1, 25, where the word vina<I>s</I>an&acirc;t, 'the disappearance of the Sarasvat&icirc;,' undoubtedly occurs, added the syllable na and forgot to correct the &acirc;, after pr&acirc;g.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_60"></A><A HREF="sbe1404.htm#fr_60">2:9</A> The translation follows K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>apa<I>n</I><I>d</I>ita's commentary, which recommends itself on account of the analogous definition of &Acirc;ry&acirc;varta given by Manu II, 22.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_61"></A><A HREF="sbe1404.htm#fr_61">2:11</A> My translation follows the text given by K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>apa<I>n</I><I>d</I>ita and <A NAME="page_3"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 3</FONT></A> B., and the explanation of the former, because it seems to me that the general sense which they give, is the correct one. I feel, however, not certain that the word. pratilomakadharm&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;m, 'of those countries where opposite laws prevail,' is more than a care less correction. The majority of the MSS. read pratilomakakshadharm&acirc;<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> (kalpadharm&acirc;<I>n</I>a<I>h</I>), which by itself is difficult of explanation. But, as the text of the next S&ucirc;tra contains an apparently superfluous phrase, I fear, we shall have to admit that the text is here disfigured by corruptions, which with our present MSS. it is impossible to remove with certainty.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_62"></A><A HREF="sbe1404.htm#fr_62">3:12</A> K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>apa<I>n</I><I>d</I>ita reads this Sutra 'etad &acirc;ry&acirc;vartam ity&acirc;<I>k</I>akshate ga&#7749;g&acirc;yamunayor antaretyeke,' and takes it as one sentence, the subject of which is 'eke.' I feel no doubt that this explanation is utterly untenable, and that the first four words have nothing to do with this Sutra, the second part of which occurs also in the Baudh&acirc;yana Dharma-s&ucirc;tra I, 1, 27. My opinion is that they originally belonged to S&ucirc;tra 11, though the state of the MSS. at my disposal does not allow me to say how S&ucirc;tra 11 has to be corrected. The general sense of S&ucirc;tra 12 is, however, perfectly certain.</P>

It deserves to be noted that the black antelope (black-buck), Oryx cervicapra, selects for its home the well-cultivated, rich plains of India only, and is entirely wanting in the sandy, mountainous or forest districts, which are now, just as in ancient times, the portion of the aboriginal tribes.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_64"></A><A HREF="sbe1404.htm#fr_64">3:14</A> Regarding the Bh&acirc;llavins, see Max M&uuml;ller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, pp. 193, 364. K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>apa<I>n</I><I>d</I>ita thinks that Nid&acirc;na means de<I>s</I>anir<I>n</I>aya, 'the disquisition on the countries,' which is the title of a section which occurs in most modern compilations on law. But it will be safer to take it as the name of a Vedic work, identical with or similar to that quoted in <I>S</I>aunaka's B<I>ri</I>haddevat&acirc;, Weber, Hist. Ind. Lit., p. 81.</P>

Though Vasish<I>th</I>a's quotation is less complete than &Acirc;pastamba's, still the following S&ucirc;tras show that he knew the conclusion of the passage, and does not take it as an authority for the sale of a daughter.</P>

He is right in saying that 'the <I>K</I>&acirc;turm&acirc;syas' is the name of a book. It is, however, not a separate work, but the k&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>a or section of a Vedic work treating of the <I>K</I>&acirc;turm&acirc;sya sacrifices (see Max M&uuml;ller, Hist. Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 355). The particular work from which our quotation has been taken, is either the Maitr&acirc;y&acirc;<I>n</I>&icirc;ya Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, or the K&acirc;<I>th</I>aka. For, as Dr. von Schroeder informs me, Maitr&acirc;y&acirc;<I>n</I>&icirc;ya Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; I, 10, 11 reads 'an<I>ri</I>ta<I>m</I> v&acirc; esh&acirc; karoti y&acirc; patyu<I>h</I> kr&icirc;t&acirc; satyath&acirc;nyai<I>s</I> <I>k</I>arati,' and the title of the k&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>a is <I>K</I>&acirc;turm&acirc;sy&acirc;ni. Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. V, 407, has found the same words in the <I>K</I>&acirc;turm&acirc;sya section of the K&acirc;<I>th</I>aka XXXVI, 5. In the translation I have added the beginning of the passage which Vasish<I>th</I>a omits, according to the Maitr&acirc;y&acirc;<I>n</I>&icirc;ya Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;.</P>

The words 'iti ha,' placed at the end of the S&ucirc;tra, indicate that it is a quotation, and that vi<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;yate, 'it is declared in the Veda,' has to be understood from S&ucirc;tra 46. Gautama XI, 11, too, alleges that the rule is based on a Vedic passage.</P>

K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>apa<I>n</I><I>d</I>ita's division of the quotation into several S&ucirc;tras is unnecessary. His explanation of an&acirc;dya, which he takes to mean 'the first of all,' is wrong. He asserts that the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is said 'to make the Veda rich,' because by sacrificing and so forth he fulfils its object and protects it. But the phrase is probably corrupt. If it is said that Soma is the king of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, the object is to indicate that an earthly king is not their master, see Gautama XI, 1.</P>
