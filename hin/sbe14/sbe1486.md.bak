### PRA*S*NA IV, ADHYÂYA 4.

1\. We will explain the (secret) penances which are not prescribed (by
others, but by the offender himself, and) particularly what shall be
done in (case) faults (have been committed) by men who, with
concentrated minds, (are) intent (on the performance of their duties).
