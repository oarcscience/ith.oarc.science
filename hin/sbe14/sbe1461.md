### PRA*S*NA II, ADHYÂYA 4, KA*ND*IKÂ 7.

1\. Now, therefore, we will declare the rule for (performing) the
twilight devotions.

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

2\. Going to a (sacred) bathing-place, he shall bathe, in case he is
impure; in case he is pure, he may, optionally, omit the bath. (But in
either case) he shall wash his feet and hands. Sipping water and
sprinkling himself, while he recites the (Rik-verses) containing the
word Surabhi, the Abliṅgas, those addressed to Varu*n*a, the
Hira*n*yavar*n*as, the Pâvamânîs, the (sacred syllables called)
Vyâh*ri*tis, and other purificatory (texts), he becomes pure (and fit to
perform the twilight devotions). <span id="fr_1212"></span>[2](#fn_1212.md)

3\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Submersion in water
(and) bathing are prescribed for all the (four) castes. But sprinkling
(water over the body), while Mantras (are being recited), is the
particular (duty) of the twice-born.'

4\. He who sprinkles himself (with water) at the beginning of any sacred
rite,--before the time of the twilight devotions,--while reciting that
same collection of purificatory (texts), becomes pure.

5\. Now they quote also (the following rules): Seated, with his face to
the west, on Darbha grass and holding Darbha blades in his (right) hand,
which <span id="fr_1213"></span>[5](#fn_1213.md)

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

is filled with water, he shall repeat the Sâvitrî one thousand times;

6\. Or (he may recite the verse) one hundred times, suppressing his
breath; <span id="fr_1214"></span>[6](#fn_1214.md)

7\. Or mentally ten times, adding the syllable Om at the beginning and
at the end and the seven Vyâh*ri*tis. <span
id="fr_1215"></span>[7](#fn_1215.md)

8\. And if he is tired by three suppressions of his breath (performed)
with (the recitation of) the (Anuvâka called) Brahmah*ri*daya (the heart
of Brahman, then let him repeat the Sâvitrî). <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[8](#fn_1216.md)

9\. In the evening he worships (the sun) with the two (verses) addressed
to Varu*n*a, 'Hear this my call, O Varu*n*a,' and 'Therefore I go to
thee.' <span id="fr_1217"></span>[9](#fn_1217.md)

10\. The same (rules apply to the twilight devotion) in the morning,
(but the worshipper) shall face the east and stand upright. <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[10](#fn_1218.md)

11\. In the day-time he worships (the sun) with the two (verses)
addressed to Mitra, 'The glory of Mitra, who supports men,' and 'Mitra
causes men to join.' <span id="fr_1219"></span>[11](#fn_1219.md)

12\. Let him begin (the twilight devotion) in the <span
id="fr_1220"></span>[12](#fn_1220.md)

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

morning very early, and finish it when the sun has risen.

13\. Let him begin (the twilight devotion) in the evening, when (the
sun) has set, (and finish it) very soon after (the appearance of the
stars);

14\. And the complete observance of the twilight devotions (produces as
its reward) an uninterrupted succession of days and nights. <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[14](#fn_1221.md)

15\. Now they quote with reference to this (subject) also the following
two verses, which have been proclaimed by the Lord of created beings
(Pra*g*âpati) 'How can those twice-born men be called Brâhma*n*as who do
not perform their twilight devotions, in the morning and in the evening
at the proper time? At his pleasure a righteous king may appoint those
Brâhma*n*as who neglect to daily perform the twilight devotions, both at
morn and at eve, to do the work of *S*ûdras.'

16\. If the time for the (twilight devotion) is allowed to pass in the
evening, (the offender shall) fast during the night; and if it is
neglected in the morning, he shall fast during the (next) day. <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[16](#fn_1222.md)

17\. He obtains (thereby) the (same) reward as if he had remained
standing and sitting (in the twilight).

18\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Whatever sin (a man)
may have committed with his organ, with his feet, with his arms, by
thoughts or by speech, from (all) that he is freed by performing the
twilight devotion in the evening.' <span
id="fr_1223"></span>[18](#fn_1223.md)

19\. (The worshipper) becomes also connected

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

(thereby) with the (next) night, and Varu*n*a will not seize him.

20\. In like manner he becomes free from the sin committed during the
night by worshipping in the morning. <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[20](#fn_1224.md)

21\. He is also connected with the (next) day, Mitra protects him and
Âditya leads him up to heaven.

22\. It is declared in the Veda, 'A Brâhma*n*a who in this same manner
daily worships in the twilight, both at morn and at eve and, being
sanctified by the Brahman, becoming one with the Brahman, and
resplendent through the Brahman, follows the rules of the *S*âstra,
gains the heaven of Brahman.' <span id="fr_1225"></span>[22](#fn_1225.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1212"></span>[246:2](sbe1461.htm#fr_1212.md) **7**. 'A sacred
bathing-place, i.e. a river or pond outside the village.'--Govinda. The
same author adds that the hands must be washed as far as the wrist, that
while sipping water the worshipper is to repeat in the evening,
Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka X, 31, and in the morning X, 32, and that if he
bathes, Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka X, 1, 12, and other texts must be recited.
The Rik containing the word Surabhi is found Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ I, 5,
11, 4, 7; the three Abliṅgas, Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka X, 1, 11; the four
verses addressed to Varu*n*a, Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ III, 4, 11, 4, and
Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka II, 4, 4. By the term Pâvamânîs the
Pavamânânuvâka, Taittirîya Brâhma*n*a I, 4, 8, is meant.

<span id="fn_1213"></span>[246:5](sbe1461.htm#fr_1213.md) The injunction to
turn the face to the west refers to the evening prayer; see also below,
Sûtra 10.

<span id="fn_1214"></span>[247:6](sbe1461.htm#fr_1214.md) Govinda states
that prâ*n*âyâma*s*a*h*, 'suppressing his breath,' has in this Sûtra no
technical meaning.

<span id="fn_1215"></span>[247:7](sbe1461.htm#fr_1215.md) Govinda says that
the order to be observed in this case is as follows: First the syllable
Om is to be recited, next the seven Vyâh*ri*tis, beginning with Bhû*h*
and ending with Satyam, then the Sâvitrî, and finally again the syllable
Om.

<span id="fn_1216"></span>[247:8](sbe1461.htm#fr_1216.md) The
Brahmah*ri*daya is Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka X, 28. This Anuvâka may be
repeated three times for each Prâ*n*âyâma (see Vasish*th*a XXV, 13), or
altogether nine times, and, if the worshipper is then tired, he may go
on repeating the Sâvitrî without suppressing his breath.

<span id="fn_1217"></span>[247:9](sbe1461.htm#fr_1217.md) Taittirîya
Sa*m*hitâ II, 1, 11, 6.

<span id="fn_1218"></span>[247:10](sbe1461.htm#fr_1218.md) Gautama II. 11.

<span id="fn_1219"></span>[247:11](sbe1461.htm#fr_1219.md) Taittirîya
Sa*m*hitâ III, 4, II, 5.

<span id="fn_1220"></span>[247:12](sbe1461.htm#fr_1220.md) Very early, i.e.
when the stars are still visible; see also Gautama II, 11, and note.

<span id="fn_1221"></span>[248:14](sbe1461.htm#fr_1221.md) The day and
night will not be cut off from his existence.

<span id="fn_1222"></span>[248:16](sbe1461.htm#fr_1222.md) Vasish*th*a XX,
4-5.

<span id="fn_1223"></span>[248:18](sbe1461.htm#fr_1223.md) Vasish*th*a
XXVI, 2.

<span id="fn_1224"></span>[249:20](sbe1461.htm#fr_1224.md) Vasish*th*a
XXVI, 3.

<span id="fn_1225"></span>[249:22](sbe1461.htm#fr_1225.md) Brahman means
here the Veda, the Sâvitrî, and the universal soul.
