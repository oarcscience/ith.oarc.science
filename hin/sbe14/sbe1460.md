<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

easy, where many rich people dwell, which abounds in industrious people,
where Âryans form the majority, and which is not easily entered by

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1186"></span>[241:1](sbe1460.htm#fr_1186) **6**. 'I.e. he
shall take up as much food only as he can swallow at one
mouthful.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1187"></span>[241:2](sbe1460.htm#fr_1187) The Dekhan and
Gu*g*arât MSS., including K., add madhu, 'honey,' after sesamum.

<span id="fn_1188"></span>[241:3](sbe1460.htm#fr_1188) This and the
following six Sûtras are left out in M. and the two copies of the
commentary. If they have, nevertheless, been received. into the text,
the reason is that similar rules occur in all Dharmasûtras, and that
Sûtra 3 begins with astamite, while astamaye occurs in Sûtra 10. It
seems therefore probable that the writer of the MS. from which M. and
Govinda's copies are derived, skipped over a line by mistake.

<span id="fn_1189"></span>[241:4](sbe1460.htm#fr_1189)-7. Vasish*th*a
XII, 34-38.

<span id="fn_1190"></span>[242:8](sbe1460.htm#fr_1190) Vish*n*u LXXI,
40.

<span id="fn_1192"></span>[242:10](sbe1460.htm#fr_1192) Vasish*th*a XII,
10.

<span id="fn_1193"></span>[242:11](sbe1460.htm#fr_1193)-12. Vasish*th*a
XII, 32-33.

<span id="fn_1194"></span>[242:13](sbe1460.htm#fr_1194) Govinda explains
prakîlaka by 'a piece of wood fastened at the town gate.' Etymologically
it would mean 'a strong bolt.' Possibly the rule may be equivalent to
Âpastamba I, II, 31, 23, and mean that a Snâtaka is not to creep through
the small door which is found in all Indian town gates, and left open
after the gates have been shut.

<span id="fn_1195"></span>[242:14](sbe1460.htm#fr_1195) Âpastamba I, 11,
31, 16.

9.

<span id="fn_1197"></span>[242:16](sbe1460.htm#fr_1197) Gautama IX, 15;

<span id="fn_1198"></span>[243:17](sbe1460.htm#fr_1198) Vish*n*u LXXI,

<span id="fn_1200"></span>[243:20](sbe1460.htm#fr_1200) Manu IV, 177;
Vish*n*u LXXI, 57, 72, 74.

<span id="fn_1201"></span>[243:21](sbe1460.htm#fr_1201)-23. Manu IV,

<span id="fn_1203"></span>[243:26](sbe1460.htm#fr_1203) Vasish*th*a XII,
45.

<span id="fn_1204"></span>[243:29](sbe1460.htm#fr_1204) E.g. in the
palace of a king, whence the attendants may drive him.

<span id="fn_1205"></span>[243:30](sbe1460.htm#fr_1205) Vasish*th*a
XIII, 58.

<span id="fn_1206"></span>[243:31](sbe1460.htm#fr_1206) Gautama IX, 65.

<span id="fn_1207"></span>[244:33](sbe1460.htm#fr_1207) Âpastamba I, 32,
21.

<span id="fn_1208"></span>[244:36](sbe1460.htm#fr_1208) Vasish*th*a XI,
1-2. A *Ri*shi is, according to Govinda, a man who knows not only the
text of the Mantras, but also their sense. But Baudhâyana,
G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 11, 4, says that a man who knows, besides the *S*âkhâ
and its Aṅgas, the Kalpa also, is called *Ri*shikalpa, i.e. one almost a
*Ri*shi. See also Âpastamba I, 2, 5, 3. A learned man (vidvas) is
probably a student who has finished not only his vow, but learned the
Veda, a so-called vidyâsnâtaka, Âpastamba I, 11, 30, 3. Regarding the
arghya or madhuparka, the honey-mixture, see Âpastamba II, 4, 8, 7-9.

<span id="fn_1209"></span>[244:37](sbe1460.htm#fr_1209) Gautama V,
27-30. I read kriyârambhe varartvi*g*au. The <span id="page_245">p.
245</span> meaning is that a bridegroom is to receive the honey-mixture
when he comes to his father-in-law's house for his wedding, and an
officiating priest when he comes to perform a sacrifice.

<span id="fn_1210"></span>[245:38](sbe1460.htm#fr_1210) Vish*n*u LXXI,
60. Govinda adds that the act is performed as a salutation.

<span id="fn_1211"></span>[245:41](sbe1460.htm#fr_1211) See e*g*.
Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka VIII, 2.
