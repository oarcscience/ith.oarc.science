### PRA*S*NA I, ADHYÂYA 5, KA*ND*IKÂ 8.

1\. Now (follows the description of) the means of purification.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

2\. The body is purified by water, the understanding by knowledge, the
soul by abstention from injuring living beings, the internal organ by
truth. <span id="fr_826"></span>[2](#fn_826)

3\. Purifying the internal organ (is called) internal purification.

4\. We will explain (the rules of) external purification.

5\. The sacrificial thread (shall be made) of Ku*s*a grass, or cotton,
(and consist) of thrice three strings.

6\. (It shall hang down) to the navel.

7\. (In putting it on) he shall raise the right arm, lower the left, and
lower the head. <span id="fr_827"></span>[7](#fn_827)

8\. The contrary (is done at sacrifices) to the manes.

9\. (If the thread is) suspended round the neck, (it is called) nivîta.

10\. (If it is) suspended below (the navel, it is called) adhopavîta.

11\. Let him perform (the rite of personal) purification, facing the
east or the north, (and) seated in a pure place; (let him) place his
right arm between his knees and wash both hands up to the wrist and both
feet (up to the ankles). <span id="fr_828"></span>[11](#fn_828)

12\. Let him not use for sipping the remainder of the water with which
he has washed his feet.

13\. But if he uses (that) for sipping, let him do it, after pouring (a
portion of it) on the ground.

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

14\. He shall sip out of the Tîrtha sacred to Brahman. <span
id="fr_829"></span>[14](#fn_829)

15\. The part (of the hand) at the root of the thumb (is called) the
Tîrtha sacred to Brahman.

16\. The part above the thumb (is called the Tîrtha) sacred to the
manes, the part at the tips of the fingers that sacred to the gods, the
part at the root of the fingers that sacred to the *Ri*shis. <span
id="fr_830"></span>[16](#fn_830)

17\. (Let him not use for sipping water that has trickled) from the
fingers, nor (water) that is covered with bubbles or foam, nor (water
that is) hot, or alkaline, or salt, or muddy, or discoloured, or has a
bad smell or taste. <span id="fr_831"></span>[17](#fn_831)

18\. (Let him not sip water) laughing, nor talking, nor standing, nor
looking about, nor bending his head or his body forward, nor while the
lock on his crown is untied, nor while his throat is wrapped up, nor
while his head is covered, nor when he is in a hurry, nor without
wearing the sacrificial thread, nor stretching his feet out, nor while
his loins are girt (with a cloth), nor without holding his right arm
between his knees, nor making a sound. <span
id="fr_832"></span>[18](#fn_832)

19\. Let him thrice drink water that reaches his heart. <span
id="fr_833"></span>[19](#fn_833)

20\. Let him wipe (his lips) thrice.

21\. Some (declare that he shall do it) twice. <span
id="fr_834"></span>[21](#fn_834)

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

22\. A woman and a *S*ûdra (shall perform) both (acts) once (only).

23\. Now they quote also (the following verse): A Brâhma*n*a is purified
by water that reaches his heart, a Kshatriya by (water) reaching his
throat, a Vai*s*ya by (water barely) taken into the mouth, a woman and a
*S*ûdra by touching (it) with the extremity (of the lips). <span
id="fr_835"></span>[23](#fn_835)

24\. 'If (drops) adhere to his teeth, (they must be considered pure)
like the teeth, because they are fixed (in the mouth) like the teeth.
Let him not sip water on their account in case they fall. If they flow
out, he will be pure.' <span id="fr_836"></span>[24](#fn_836)

25\. Now they quote also (the following verse): If anything adheres to
the teeth, (it is pure) like the teeth; and if he swallows (it or)
whatever else may be in the mouth (or) may remain after sipping water,
(he will become) pure.' <span id="fr_837"></span>[25](#fn_837)

26\. (After sipping) he shall touch the cavities (of the head) with
water, the feet, the navel, the head, (and) lastly the left hand. <span
id="fr_838"></span>[26](#fn_838)

27\. If he becomes impure while holding (a vessel) made of metal, he
shall put it down, sip water and sprinkle it, when he is going to take
it up.

28\. Now if he becomes impure (while he is occupied) with food, he shall
put it down, sip water and sprinkle it, when he is going to take it
up. <span id="fr_839"></span>[28](#fn_839)

29\. Now if he becomes impure (while occupied)

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

with water, he shall put it down, sip water and sprinkle it, when he is
going to take it up

30\. That is contrary (to the rule) in (the case of an earthen)
vessel. <span id="fr_840"></span>[30](#fn_840)

31\. In (the case of a vessel) made of wood there is an option.

32\. Defiled (objects) made of metal must be scoured with cowdung,
earth, and ashes, or with one of these (three). <span
id="fr_841"></span>[32](#fn_841)

33\. Copper, silver, and gold (must be cleaned) with acids. <span
id="fr_842"></span>[33](#fn_842)

34\. Earthen vessels must be heated. <span
id="fr_843"></span>[34](#fn_843)

35\. (Objects) made of wood must be planed.

36\. (Objects) made of bamboo (must be cleaned) with cowdung, <span
id="fr_844"></span>[36](#fn_844)

37\. (Objects) made of fruits with a rope of cow-hair, <span
id="fr_845"></span>[37](#fn_845)

38\. Skins of black deer with (ground) Bel nut and rice,

39\. Blankets (of the hair of the mountain goat) with Areka nuts, <span
id="fr_846"></span>[39](#fn_846)

40\. (Cloth) made of (sheep's) wool by the (rays of the) sun,

41\. Linen (cloth) with a paste of yellow mustard, <span
id="fr_847"></span>[41](#fn_847)

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

42\. Cotton cloth with earth, <span id="fr_848"></span>[42](#fn_848)

43\. Skins (other than deer-skins shall be treated) like cotton
cloth, <span id="fr_849"></span>[43](#fn_849)

44\. Stones and gems like (objects) made of metal, <span
id="fr_850"></span>[44](#fn_850)

45\. Bones like wood, <span id="fr_851"></span>[45](#fn_851)

46\. Conch-shells, horn, pearl-shells, and ivory like linen cloth. <span
id="fr_852"></span>[46](#fn_852)

47\. Or (they may be cleaned) with milk.

48\. (Objects) which have been defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen,
or a dead body, (but) are agreeable to the eye and the nose, shall be
rubbed seven times with one of the substances mentioned above.

49\. (Objects) not made of metal which are in the same condition must be
thrown away. <span id="fr_853"></span>[49](#fn_853)

50\. The cups and vessels (used) at a sacrifice (must be cleaned)
according to the injunction (of the Veda). <span
id="fr_854"></span>[50](#fn_854)

51\. The Veda (declares), 'They do not become impure through Soma.'

52\. 'Time, fire, purity of mind, water and the like (fluids), smearing
with cowdung and ignorance (of defilement) are declared to be the
sixfold (means of) purification for created beings.' <span
id="fr_855"></span>[52](#fn_855)

53\. Now they quote also (the following verse):

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

\[paragraph continues\] 'A clever man, who knows (the rules of)
purification and is desirous of righteousness, shall perform (the rites
of) purification, after having fully considered the time, and the place
(of the defilement), likewise himself, (as well as) the object (to be
cleaned) and the substance (to be employed), the purpose of the object,
the cause (of the defilement), and the condition (of the thing or person
defiled).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_826"></span>[165:2](sbe1441.htm#fr_826) **8**. Vasish*th*a
III, 60.

<span id="fn_827"></span>[165:7](sbe1441.htm#fr_827)-9. Manu II, 63.

<span id="fn_828"></span>[165:11](sbe1441.htm#fr_828) Vasish*th*a III,
26. Govinda points out that the word *s*au*k*am, '(rite of)
purification,' has here the meaning of â*k*amanam, 'sipping water.' He
thinks that the *k*a, 'and,' which stands after pâdau, 'both feet,'
indicates that other portions of the body which have been defiled must
be washed also.

<span id="fn_829"></span>[166:14](sbe1441.htm#fr_829) Vasish*th*a III,
26.

<span id="fn_830"></span>[166:16](sbe1441.htm#fr_830) Vish*n*u LXII,
3-4. All the MSS. except M. place the Tîrtha sacred to the gods at the
root of the fingers, and that sacred to the *Ri*shis at the tips of the
fingers; and Govinda has the same erroneous reading.

<span id="fn_831"></span>[166:17](sbe1441.htm#fr_831) Vasish*th*a III,
36.

<span id="fn_832"></span>[166:18](sbe1441.htm#fr_832) Vasish*th*a III,
30.

<span id="fn_833"></span>[166:19](sbe1441.htm#fr_833)-20. Vasish*th*a
III, 26; Âpastamba I, 5, 16, 3.

<span id="fn_834"></span>[166:21](sbe1441.htm#fr_834) Vasish*th*a III,
27; Âpastamba I, 5.16, 4.

<span id="fn_835"></span>[167:23](sbe1441.htm#fr_835) Vasish*th*a III,
31-34.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[167:24](sbe1441.htm#fr_836) The MSS. read in
the last pâda of this verse, teshâ*m* sa*m*srâye \[ya or
va\]-*kk*u*k*i*t*iti. I think sa*m*srâva*n*â*kkh*u*k*ir iti is the
correct reading.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[167:25](sbe1441.htm#fr_837) Vasish*th*a III,
41.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[167:26](sbe1441.htm#fr_838) Vasish*th*a III,
28-29.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[167:28](sbe1441.htm#fr_839) Vasish*th*a III,
43-44.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[168:30](sbe1441.htm#fr_840) '(The word)
amatram, literally "a vessel," denotes here an earthen vessel. The
meaning is that such a one, if it is very much defiled, shall only be
put down and not be taken back. Any other (earthen vessel) shall be
heated.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[168:32](sbe1441.htm#fr_841) Vasish*th*a III,
49.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[168:33](sbe1441.htm#fr_842) Manu V, 114;
Vasish*th*a III, 63.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[168:34](sbe1441.htm#fr_843)-35. Vasish*th*a
III, 49.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[168:36](sbe1441.htm#fr_844) Vasish*th*a III,
53.

<span id="fn_845"></span>[168:37](sbe1441.htm#fr_845) Vasish*th*a III,
54. Govinda thinks that the word ra*gg*u, 'a rope,' is used here in the
sense of 'a conglomeration,' and merely indicates that a quantity of
cowhair must be used.

<span id="fn_846"></span>[168:39](sbe1441.htm#fr_846) Manu V, 120.

<span id="fn_847"></span>[168:41](sbe1441.htm#fr_847) Vasish*th*a III,
55.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[169:42](sbe1441.htm#fr_848) Vasish*th*a III,
49.

<span id="fn_849"></span>[169:43](sbe1441.htm#fr_849) Vasish*th*a III,
53.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[169:44](sbe1441.htm#fr_850) Vasish*th*a III,
50.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[169:45](sbe1441.htm#fr_851) Vasish*th*a III,
52.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[169:46](sbe1441.htm#fr_852) Vasish*th*a III,
51.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[169:49](sbe1441.htm#fr_853) Vasish*th*a III,
59.

<span id="fn_854"></span>[169:50](sbe1441.htm#fr_854) Govinda explains
this Sûtra differently. He says: 'The fault of defilement by remnants
does not affect sacrificial cups and vessels. This must be understood.
If they are defiled by urine and the like, they must be thrown away.' My
explanation is based on the parallel passage of Âpastamba I, 5, 17, 13.
See also below, I, 6, 13, 11 seq.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[169:52](sbe1441.htm#fr_855) Vish*n*u XXII, 88.
