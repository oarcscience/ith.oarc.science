### PRA*S*NA I, ADHYÂYA 1, KA*ND*IKÂ 2.

1\. There is a dispute regarding five (practices) both in the south and
in the north. <span id="fr_742"></span>[1](#fn_742.md)

2\. We will explain those (peculiar) to the south.

3\. They are, to eat in the company of an uninitiated person, to eat in
the company of one's wife, to eat stale food, to marry the daughter of a
maternal uncle or of a paternal aunt. <span
id="fr_743"></span>[3](#fn_743.md)

4\. Now (the customs peculiar) to the north are, to deal in wool, to
drink rum, to sell animals that have teeth in the upper and in the lower
jaws, to follow the trade of arms, to go to sea. <span
id="fr_744"></span>[4](#fn_744.md)

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

5\. He who follows (these practices) in any other country than where
they prevail, commits sin. <span id="fr_745"></span>[5](#fn_745.md)

6\. For each (of these customs) the (rule of the) country should be
(considered) the authority.

7\. Gautama declares that that is false. <span
id="fr_746"></span>[7](#fn_746.md)

8\. And one should not take heed of either (set of practices) because
they are opposed to the tradition of the *S*ish*t*as.

9\. The country of the Âryas (Âryâvarta) lies to the east of the region
where (the river Sarasvatî) disappears, to the west of the Black-forest
(Kâlakavana), to the north of the Pâripâtra (mountains), to the south of
the Himâlaya. The rule of conduct which (prevails) there, is
authoritative. <span id="fr_747"></span>[9](#fn_747.md)

10\. Some (declare) the country between the (rivers) Yamunâ and Ganges
(to be the Âryâvarta). <span id="fr_748"></span>[10](#fn_748.md)

11\. Now the Bhâllavins quote also the (following) verse: <span
id="fr_749"></span>[11](#fn_749.md)

12\. 'In the west the boundary-river, in the east the region where the
sun rises,--as far as the black antelopes wander (between these two
limits), so far spiritual pre-eminence (is found).' <span
id="fr_750"></span>[12](#fn_750.md)

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

13\. The inhabitants of Avantî, of Aṅga, of Magadha, of Surâsh*t*ra, of
the Dekhan, of Upâv*ri*t, of Sindh, and the Sauvîrâs are of mixed
origin. <span id="fr_751"></span>[13](#fn_751.md)

14\. He who has visited the (countries of the) Âra*tt*as, Kâraskaras,
Pu*nd*ras, Sauvîras, Vaṅgas, Kaliṅgas, (or) Prânûnas shall offer a
Punastoma or a Sarvap*ri*sh*th*â (ish*t*i). <span
id="fr_752"></span>[14](#fn_752.md)

15\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'He commits sin through
his feet, who travels to the (country of the) Kaliṅgas. The sages
declare the Vai*s*vânarî ish*t*i to be a purification for him.' <span
id="fr_753"></span>[15](#fn_753.md)

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

16\. 'Even if many offences have been committed, they recommend for the
removal of the sin the Pavitresh*t*i. For that (sacrifice) is a most
excellent means of purification.'

17\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He who performs (by
turns) in each season the Vai*s*vânarî (ish*t*i), the Vrâtapatî
(ish*t*i), and the Pavitresh*t*i is freed from (all) sins.' <span
id="fr_754"></span>[17](#fn_754.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_742"></span>[146:1](sbe1435.htm#fr_742.md) **2**. The boundary
between the north and south of India is, as Govinda also points out, the
river Narmadâ.

<span id="fn_743"></span>[146:3](sbe1435.htm#fr_743.md) Some of the customs
mentioned here still prevail in parts of southern India. Thus the
marriages between cousins occur among the De*s*astha and Karhâ*d*â
Brâhma*n*as of the Dekhan.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[146:4](sbe1435.htm#fr_744.md) The first two
customs mentioned still prevail in the north, especially in Ka*s*mîr,
where Brâhma*n*as commonly deal in wool and woollen cloth. Spirituous
liquor is not now drunk openly, but its use is sanctioned in the
Ka*s*mîrian Nîlamata-purâ*n*a. Many Brâhmanical families in the north,
especially in the North-western Provinces, subsist by enlisting as
soldiers in the British and native armies.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[147:5](sbe1435.htm#fr_745.md)-6. A similar
argument is given by the Ka*s*mîrians for the lawfulness of the
consumption of meat, which they justify by a de*s*agu*n*a or 'virtue of
their country.'

<span id="fn_746"></span>[147:7](sbe1435.htm#fr_746.md) Gautama XI, 20.

<span id="fn_747"></span>[147:9](sbe1435.htm#fr_747.md) Vasish*th*a I, 8,
10. Many MSS., and among them the Telugu copy of the commentary, read
Pâriyâtra instead of Pâripâtra, which latter I consider to be the
correct form of the word.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[147:10](sbe1435.htm#fr_748.md) Vasish*th*a I, 12.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[147:11](sbe1435.htm#fr_749.md) Vasish*th*a I, 14.
Govinda remarks that the Bhâllavins are a school studying the Sâma-veda.
See also Max Müller, Hist. Anc. Sansk. Lit., pp. 193, 364.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[147:12](sbe1435.htm#fr_750.md) Vasish*th*a I, 15.
There is a great uncertainty in the MSS. about the word following
sindhu*h*. I have adopted the reading of <span id="page_148">p.
148</span> M., sindhur vidhara*n*î, 'the boundary-river,' which occurs
also in the parallel passage of Vasish*th*a. The Dekhan and Gu*g*arât
MSS. read vi*k*ara*n*î or vi*k*ara*n*â, and the two copies of the
commentary visara*n*î. The sense of these various readings appears to be
'the river that vanishes or looses itself,' i.e. the Sarasvatî.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[148:13](sbe1435.htm#fr_751.md) This and the
following two Sûtras are intended to show that the customs prevailing in
the countries named have no authority and must not be followed. Avantî
corresponds to western Mâlvâ, Aṅga to western Bengal, Magadha to Bihar,
and Surâsh*t*ra to southern Ká*th*îâvâ*d*. The Sauvîras, who are always
associated with the Sindhians, probably dwelt in the south-west of the
Pa*ñg*âb, near Multân. The Upâv*ri*ts probably are the same as the
Upâv*ri*ttas mentioned Mahâbhârata VI, 49. But I am unable to deter-mine
their seats.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[148:14](sbe1435.htm#fr_752.md) The Âra*tt*as
dwelt in the Pa*ñg*âb (Lassen, Ind. Alth. I, p. 973, sec. ed.), and are
greatly blamed, Mahâbhârata VIII, 44, 36 seq. The Kâraskaras are named
in the same chapter of the Mahâbhârata as a degraded tribe, but seem to
belong to the south of India. The Kaliṅgas are the inhabitants of the
eastern coast of India, between Orissa and the mouth of the K*ri*sh*n*â
river. The Pu*nd*ras, who are mentioned as a degraded tribe in the
Aitareya-brâhma*n*a VII, 18, and occur frequently in the Mahâbhârata,
and the Vaṅgas belong to Bengal (see Lassen, Ind. Alth. I, 669, sec.
ed.; Cunningham, Anc. Geog. p. 480). Regarding the Pu*n*a-stoma, see
Gautama XIX, 7 note; and regarding the Sarvap*ri*sh*th*â ish*t*i,
Taittirîya-sa*m*hitâ II, 3, 7, 1-2.

<span id="fn_753"></span>[148:15](sbe1435.htm#fr_753.md) Âpastamba I, 11,
32, 18.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[149:17](sbe1435.htm#fr_754.md) Vasish*th*a XXII,
10. The meaning is that in each of the three seasons of the year,
Grîshma, Varsha, Hemanta, one of the three sacrifices is to be offered.
