### CHAPTER VII.

1\. There are four orders, <span id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_223.md)

2\. Viz. (that of) the student, (that of) the house-holder, (that of)
the hermit, and (that of) the ascetic.

3\. A man who has studied one, two, or three Vedas without violating the
rules of studentship, may enter any of these (orders), whichsoever he
pleases. <span id="fr_224"></span>[3](#fn_224.md)

4\. A (professed) student shall serve his teacher until death; <span
id="fr_225"></span>[4](#fn_225.md)

5\. And in case the teacher dies, he shall serve the sacred fire. <span
id="fr_226"></span>[5](#fn_226.md)

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

6\. For it has been declared in the Veda, 'The fire is thy
teacher:' <span id="fr_227"></span>[6](#fn_227.md)

7\. (A student, whether professed or temporary), shall bridle his
tongue; <span id="fr_228"></span>[7](#fn_228.md)

8\. He shall eat in the fourth, sixth, or eighth hour of the day. <span
id="fr_229"></span>[8](#fn_229.md)

9\. He shall go out in order to beg. <span
id="fr_230"></span>[9](#fn_230.md)

10\. He shall obey his teacher. <span id="fr_231"></span>[10](#fn_231.md)

11\. He either (may wear all his hair) tied in a knot or (keep merely) a
lock on the crown of his head tied in a knot, (shaving the other parts
of the head.) <span id="fr_232"></span>[11](#fn_232.md)

12\. If the teacher walks, he shall attend him walking after him; if the
teacher is seated, standing; if the teacher lies down, seated. <span
id="fr_233"></span>[12](#fn_233.md)

13\. He shall study after having been called (by the teacher, and not
request the latter to begin the lesson). <span
id="fr_234"></span>[13](#fn_234.md)

14\. Let him announce (to the teacher) all that he has received (when
begging), and eat after permission (has been given to him). <span
id="fr_235"></span>[14](#fn_235.md)

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

15\. Let him avoid to sleep on a cot, to clean his teeth, to wash (his
body for pleasure), to apply collyrium (to his eyes),. to anoint (his
body), and to wear shoes or a parasol. <span
id="fr_236"></span>[15](#fn_236.md)

16\. (While reciting his prayers) he shall stand in the day-time and sit
down at night. <span id="fr_237"></span>[16](#fn_237.md)

17\. Let him bathe three times a day. <span
id="fr_238"></span>[17](#fn_238.md)

I agree with K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita in thinking that the apparently
purposeless particle 'and,' which is used in <span id="page_41">p.

given in other Sm*ri*tis, according to which the student, on the death
of the teacher, shall serve the teacher's son, a fellow-student, or the
teacher's wife, and the service of the sacred fire is the last resource
only. See Vish*n*u XXVIII, 44-45; Gautama III, 7-8.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[41:6](sbe1410.htm#fr_227.md) These words form
