<P><A NAME="fn_1136"></A><A HREF="sbe1457.htm#fr_1136">229:33</A>-34. Aupa<I>g</I>andhani is one of the ancient teachers of the White Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, mentioned in the lists incorporated in the <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a XIV, 5, 5, 21; 7, 3, 26. The legends of the White Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda frequently mention king <I>G</I>anaka of Videha, and assert that that philosopher king had frequent and intimate intercourse with Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya and other teachers of the Veda which &Acirc;ditya revealed. It seems to me, therefore, highly probable that Govinda is right in taking the vocative <I>g</I>anaka in S&ucirc;tra 34 as a proper name, and in asserting that the verse belongs to a conversation between Aupa<I>g</I>andhani and <I>G</I>anaka. This explanation, which possibly may be based on an ancient tradition of Baudh&acirc;yana's school, is certainly preferable to Haradatta's statement on &Acirc;pastamba II, 6, 13, 7, that these verses express the sentiments of a husband who had neglected to watch his wives, and later learned that he would not derive any spiritual benefit from their offspring. In the text of S&ucirc;tra 34 I read with the Dekhan MSS. and &Acirc;pastamba, loc. cit., &icirc;rshy&acirc;mi, instead of ishy&acirc;mi, which M. and the commentary give.</P>

Govinda asserts that the S&ucirc;tra is intended to forbid the independent action of women with respect to things inherited. The correct view probably is that with this S&ucirc;tra the topic of the duties and rights of women begins, and that the rule contains a general maxim.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1145"></A><A HREF="sbe1457.htm#fr_1145">231:46</A> Colebrooke V, Dig. CXXXI. The text is in great confusion. The Dekhan and Gu<I>g</I>ar&acirc;t MSS., except K., read, na d&acirc;ya<I>m</I> nirindriy&acirc; hyad&acirc;y&acirc;<I>s</I> <I>k</I>a striyo mat&acirc; iti sruti<I>h</I>; K. has, tasm&acirc;t[n]nirindriy&acirc; hy. st. m. i. <I>s</I>ru. || tasm&acirc;t striyo nirindriy&acirc; ad&acirc;y&acirc;d&icirc;r api p&acirc;p&acirc;t; while M. and the I. O. copy of the commentary have, tasm&acirc;nnirindriy&acirc; ad&acirc;y&acirc;<I>s</I> <I>k</I>a striyo mat&acirc; iti <I>s</I>ruti<I>h</I> [s&ucirc;ti<I>h</I>, M.] The Telugu copy is mutilated, and reads n&acirc;dayantiriti sruti<I>h</I>. Though the reading of the Dekhan MSS. is supported by Mitrami<I>s</I>ra V&icirc;ramitrodaya, fol. 209, p. I, 1. 3, it is certainly not the original one, for there is no verb by which the accusative 'd&acirc;yam' is governed. Mitrami<I>s</I>ra's attempt to make it depend on 'arhati' in the verse quoted in S&ucirc;tra 45 is futile, because, according to the usage of the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ras, a S&ucirc;tra may be completed by a verb taken frost another original aphorism of the author, but cannot be connecter with a portion of a quotation taken from some other work. This same principle, of course, applies not only to S&ucirc;tras, but to the writings of all other authors, whether Indian or European. The reading of K., M., and of the I. O. copy of the commentary is not open to the objection just mentioned, and therefore preferable. But it seems to me highly probable that, nevertheless, it is not <A NAME="page_232"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 232</FONT></A> quite genuine; for the word 'tasm&acirc;t,' with which it begins, is not required, because its sense is already expressed by the following hi,' and because the S&ucirc;tra apparently contains half an Anush<I>t</I>ubh <I>S</I>loka, which the insertion of tasm&acirc;t destroys. It is also easy to see how it came to be inserted. Every Ya<I>g</I>urved&icirc; who read the passage would be reminded of the analogous passage of the Taittir&icirc;ya Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; VI, 5, 8, 2, 'tasm&acirc;t striyo nirindriy&acirc; ad&acirc;y&acirc;d&icirc;r api p&acirc;p&acirc;t pu<I>m</I>sa<I>h</I> upastitaram,' which in K. has actually been inserted after our S&ucirc;tra. In the Vedic Mantra 'tasm&acirc;t' is required, and is certainly the genuine reading. Hence it seems to have been transferred into Baudh&acirc;yana's text, possibly by the mistake of some scribe who, according to the habit of his kind, took a marginal reference to the beginning of the Vedic passage for a correction of the text. In my opinion it must be thrown out. The sense of the half verse remains exactly the same. It corresponds to Manu IX, 18. According to Govindasv&acirc;min and others its object is to show that women are incapable of inheriting, and the word d&acirc;ya, 'portion,' must be taken in the sense of 'a share of the inheritance.' For a full discussion of this point, I refer to the Introductory Note on Book I, Chapter II, Sect. 14 of West and Miller's Digest of H. L. C., third edition.</P>
