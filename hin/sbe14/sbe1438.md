### Footnotes

<span id="fn_801"></span>[158:1](sbe1438.htm#fr_801) **5**. Regarding
the term Snâtaka, see Âpastamba I, 11, 30, 1-4. Govinda thinks that the
following rules are intended to apply In the first instance to a student
who has performed the Samâvartana on completion of his studentship and
lives unmarried at home. For though the Sm*ri*ti declares it necessary
for a student to enter, on completing his term, at once into one of the
remaining three <span id="page_159">p. 159</span> orders, it may happen;
as the commentator observes, that the Snâtaka's marriage cannot take
place immediately. The correctness of this view is proved by Âpastamba
I, 2, 8, and by the fact that below, II, 3, 5, the rules for a married
Snâtaka are given separately.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[159:2](sbe1438.htm#fr_802)-5. Vasish*th*a XII,
14.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[159:6](sbe1438.htm#fr_803) Âpastamba I, 2, 8,
2.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[159:7](sbe1438.htm#fr_804) Regarding the Parva
days, see Vasish*th*a XII, 21 note.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[159:8](sbe1438.htm#fr_805) Vasish*th*a XII,
2-4. 'Though the Snâtaka is the subject of the discussion, the word
"his" is used (in this Sûtra) in order to introduce the remaining duties
of a householder also.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[159:9](sbe1438.htm#fr_806) The carpenter
(rathakâra) is a *S*ûdra, but connected with the Vedic sacrifices.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[159:10](sbe1438.htm#fr_807) '"Food"
(bhaiksham), i.e. a quantity of begged food. The meaning is that in
times of distress he may beg from many.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[159:12](sbe1438.htm#fr_808) With that, i.e.
with the food obtained by begging. Regarding <span id="page_160">p.
160</span> the Pâkaya*gñ*as, see Gautama VIII, 18. Govinda gives as an
instance of the rites securing welfare (bhûtikarmâ*n*i) the
âyushya*k*aru, a rice-offering intended to procure long life.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[160:13](sbe1438.htm#fr_809) Govinda explains
Baudhâyana by Kâ*n*vâyana, and adds that either the author speaks of
himself in the third person or a pupil must have compiled the book.
