### PRA*S*NA I, ADHYÂYA 5, KA*ND*IKÂ 11.

1\. Referring to deaths and births, they declare that the impurity of
Sapi*nd*as lasts ten days; excepting officiating priests, men who have
performed the initiatory ceremony of a Soma-sacrifice, and students of
the Veda. <span id="fr_888"></span>[1](#fn_888.md)

2\. But amongst Sapi*nd*as Sapi*nd*a-relationship (extends) to the
seventh person. <span id="fr_889"></span>[2](#fn_889.md)

3\. (If children die) before the completion of the seventh month or
before teething, (the relatives) shall bathe. <span
id="fr_890"></span>[3](#fn_890.md)

4\. In (the case of a child) that dies before the completion of its
third year or before teething, offerings of funeral cakes and water are
not prescribed, and one should not burn its (body); <span
id="fr_891"></span>[4](#fn_891.md)

5\. Nor when unmarried maidens die.

6\. Some do it in the case of married daughters. <span
id="fr_892"></span>[6](#fn_892.md)

7\. That (is done) in order to gain the good-will <span
id="fr_893"></span>[7](#fn_893.md)

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

of the people. Women are considered to have no business with the sacred
texts.

8\. 'The relatives of unmarried women become pure after three days. But
the uterine brothers become pure by (following) the rule mentioned
before.' <span id="fr_894"></span>[8](#fn_894.md)

9\. Moreover, the great-grandfather, the grand-father, the father,
oneself, the uterine brothers, the son by a wife of equal caste, the
grandson, (and) the great-grandson--these they call Sapi*nd*as, but not
the (great-grandson's) son;--and amongst these a son and a son's son
(together with their father are) sharers of an undivided oblation. <span
id="fr_895"></span>[9](#fn_895.md)

10\. The sharers of divided oblations they call Sakulyas. <span
id="fr_896"></span>[10](#fn_896.md)

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

11\. If no other (relations) are living, the property (of a deceased
male) descends to them (the Sapi*nd*as). <span
id="fr_897"></span>[11](#fn_897.md)

12\. On failure of Sapi*nd*as, the Sakulyas (inherit). <span
id="fr_898"></span>[12](#fn_898.md)

13\. On failure of them, the teacher who (holds the place of a
spiritual) father, a pupil, or an officiating priest shall take
it, <span id="fr_899"></span>[13](#fn_899.md)

14\. On failure of them, the king. Let him give that property to persons
well-versed in the three Vedas. <span id="fr_900"></span>[14](#fn_900.md)

15\. But the king should never take for himself the property of a
Brâhma*n*a. <span id="fr_901"></span>[15](#fn_901.md)

16\. Now they quote also (the following verse): The property of a
Brâhma*n*a destroys (him who

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

takes it), together with sons and grandsons; poison kills one man only.
(Therefore) they do not declare poison to be (the worst) poison. The
property of a Brâhma*n*a is called (the worst) poison.'

17\. If a birth and a death occur together, one. and the same period of
ten (days and) nights (shall serve for both).

18\. Now if (other deaths or births) happen before the completion of the
ten (days and) nights (of impurity), the first period of ten (days and)
nights (shall suffice, provided the new cause of impurity occurs) before
the end of the ninth day. <span id="fr_902"></span>[18](#fn_902.md)

19\. On a birth, indeed, the parents (alone) become impure during ten
days. <span id="fr_903"></span>[19](#fn_903.md)

20\. Some (declare that) the mother (alone becomes impure), because
(people) avoid (lying-in women alone). <span
id="fr_904"></span>[20](#fn_904.md)

21\. Others (say that) the father (alone becomes impure) because the
semen is the chief cause (of the generation). <span
id="fr_905"></span>[21](#fn_905.md)

22\. For sons who were born without mothers, are mentioned in the
revealed texts.

23\. But (the correct opinion is that) both the parents (become impure)
because they are equally connected (with the event).

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

24\. But when a death (has happened, the relatives of the deceased),
allowing the youngest to begin, shall pass their sacrificial threads
over the right shoulder and under the left arm, descend into the water
at a bathing-place, submerge (their bodies), emerge (out of the water),
ascend the bank, sip water, pour out libations for the (deceased,
repeating the last four acts) severally three times thereafter, ascend
the bank, sip water, touch a coal, water or the like at the door of
their house, and sit during ten days on mats, eating food that does not
contain pungent condiments or salt. <span
id="fr_906"></span>[24](#fn_906.md)

25\. (Let him perform) a funeral sacrifice on the eleventh or the
twelfth (day). <span id="fr_907"></span>[25](#fn_907.md)

26\. In (performing) the remaining rites (one should) conform to (the
customs of) the people. <span id="fr_908"></span>[26](#fn_908.md)

27\. In case of a (death) let him also keep (a period of impurity) for
(persons who are) not (his) Sapi*nd*as, according to the degree of
nearness, three (days and) nights, a day and a night, one day and so
forth, <span id="fr_909"></span>[27](#fn_909.md)

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

28\. For a teacher, a sub-teacher (upâdhyâya), and their sons, three
(days and) nights, <span id="fr_910"></span>[28](#fn_910.md)

29\. Likewise for officiating priests, <span
id="fr_911"></span>[29](#fn_911.md)

30\. Let hire keep. on account of a pupil, for one who has the same
spiritual guide, for a fellow-student (sabrahma*k*ârin) three (days and)
nights, one day and a night, one day and so forth (as periods of
impurity). <span id="fr_912"></span>[30](#fn_912.md)

31\. On a miscarriage females (remain impure) as many (days and) nights
as months (elapsed after conception). <span
id="fr_913"></span>[31](#fn_913.md)

32\. If he unintentionally touches the corpse of a stranger, he becomes
at once pure after bathing dressed in his clothes.

33\. (If he does it) intentionally, (he will remain impure) during three
(days and) nights.

34\. And (the same rules apply if he touches a woman) during her
courses. <span id="fr_914"></span>[34](#fn_914.md)

35\. A son who is born from (intercourse with a temporarily unclean
woman) becomes an Abhi*s*asta. Thereby the penances (to be performed) by
him have been explained.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

36\. On touching one who sells the Veda, a sacrificial post, an outcast,
a funeral pile, a dog, or a *K*a*nd*âla he shall bathe. <span
id="fr_915"></span>[36](#fn_915.md)

37\. Now if a worm is produced in an open wound that is filled with pus
and sanies, how shall, in that case, a penance be performed? <span
id="fr_916"></span>[37](#fn_916.md)

38\. He who is bitten by a worm will become pure on bathing (daily)
during three days and drinking (a mixture of) cow's urine, cowdung,
milk, sour milk, butter, and water boiled with Ku*s*a grass.

39\. He who has been touched by a dog shall bathe dressed in his
clothes; <span id="fr_917"></span>[39](#fn_917.md)

40\. Or he becomes pure by washing that spot (where he has been
touched), by touching it with fire, by (afterwards) again washing it and
his feet, and by sipping water.

41\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'But a Brâhma*n*a who
has been bitten by a dog, is purified if he goes to a river that flows
into the ocean, (bathes there and) suppresses his breath one hundred
times and (afterwards) eats clarified butter. He will (also) become pure
at, once on bathing (in water brought) in golden or silver (vessels), or
in a cow's horn, or in new (earthen pots).' <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_888"></span>[177:1](sbe1444.htm#fr_888.md) **11**. Vasish*th*a
IV, 16. Officiating priests, Soma-sacrificers, and students do not
become impure by deaths or births occurring among their relatives; see
Vasish*th*a XIX, 48; Gautama XIV, 1.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[177:2](sbe1444.htm#fr_889.md) Vasish*th*a IV, 17.
For the specification of the extent of the Sapi*nd*a-relationship, see
below, Sûtra 9.

<span id="fn_890"></span>[177:3](sbe1444.htm#fr_890.md) Vish*n*u XXII, 27.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[177:4](sbe1444.htm#fr_891.md) Vish*n*u XXII, 28;
Gautama XIV, 34, 43.

<span id="fn_892"></span>[177:6](sbe1444.htm#fr_892.md) Gautama XIV, 36.
'That refers to the Sapi*nd*as on the father's side.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[177:7](sbe1444.htm#fr_893.md) Manu IX, 18.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[178:8](sbe1444.htm#fr_894.md) This verse, which
occurs in all my MSS. of the text, is left out in the two copies of
Govinda's commentary.

<span id="fn_895"></span>[178:9](sbe1444.htm#fr_895.md) Colebrooke,
Dâyabhâga XI, 1, 37; V. Digest CCCXCVII. The text on which Colebrooke's
two versions are based differs from that of my MSS. and of Govinda by
reading avibhaktadâyâdân instead of teshâ*m* *k*a putrapautram \[v. l.
°pautrakam\] avibhaktadâyam. The meaning of the latter clause, which is
placed parenthetically before sapi*nd*ân â*k*akshate, '(these) they call
Sapi*nd*as,' seems to be that a father with his son and grandson share
the cakes offered at one funeral sacrifice by the fourth descendant. Its
object is to show that the group called Sapi*nd*as consists of two such
subdivisions, between whom the middlemost forms the connecting link. For
the middlemost, the svayam, 'oneself,' of the text, first offers the
cakes to his three ancestors and later receives the cakes, together with
his first two descendants, from his great-grandson. Govinda gives no
help. He merely remarks that the Sûtra contains a paribhâshâ or
technical rule of interpretation, and that the words api *k*a,
'moreover,' indicate that it is an expansion of Sûtra 2.

<span id="fn_896"></span>[178:10](sbe1444.htm#fr_896.md) Colebrooke, loc.
cit. According to *G*îmûtavâhana the Sakulyas are the three ascendants
beyond the great-grandfather and the three descendants beyond the
great-grandson. Others, among <span id="page_179">p. 179</span> whom
Govinda takes his place, explain the word sakulya to mean 'members of
one family' in general. Govinda says, sambandhavi*s*esha*gñ*âne sati
sapi*nd*â u*k*yante sambandhamâtra*gñ*âne sakulyâ*h*\|\| Ata*s* *k*a
sapi*nd*â api sakulyâ*h*\|\| 'If a particular relationship is known,
they are called Sapi*nd*as; and if (the fact) only is known that
relationship exists, Sakulyas. Hence the Sapi*nd*as are also Sakulyas.'

<span id="fn_897"></span>[179:11](sbe1444.htm#fr_897.md) Colebrooke, loc.
cit. Both the Dâyabhâga and the Digest read satsvanga*g*eshu, 'when
there is male issue,' and the Vîramitrodaya, fol. 218, p. 2, l. 7,
agrees with them. The MSS. read all satsv anyeshu, which may, however,
be taken with Govinda for asatsv anyeshu, because the preceding word
ends in *e*. Govinda explains anyeshu, 'others,' by aurasâdishu,
'legitimate sons of the body, and so forth.'

<span id="fn_898"></span>[179:12](sbe1444.htm#fr_898.md) Colebrooke,
Dâyabhâga, loc. cit. The digest omits this Sûtra.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[179:13](sbe1444.htm#fr_899.md) Colebrooke, loc.
cit. Gîmûtavâhana wrongly reads pitâ *k*â*k*ârya*h*, 'the father and the
teacher.' Govinda gives the explanation adopted above. Regarding the
spiritual fatherhood of the teacher, see e.g. Vasish*th*a II, 4.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[179:14](sbe1444.htm#fr_900.md) Colebrooke, loc.
ca. Govinda reads satsvam, 'the property of a holy man,' instead of
tatsvam, 'that property.'

<span id="fn_901"></span>[179:15](sbe1444.htm#fr_901.md) Colebrooke V, Dig.
CCCCXLIV; Vasish*th*a XVII, 86.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[180:18](sbe1444.htm#fr_902.md) Vasish*th*a IV,
23-25. Govinda points out that in case the second birth or death happens
after the completion of the ninth day, the rule given (Gautama XIV, 7)
applies.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[180:19](sbe1444.htm#fr_903.md) Vasish*th*a IV,
20-21.

<span id="fn_904"></span>[180:20](sbe1444.htm#fr_904.md) Vasish*th*a IV,
21-22. Tatparihara*n*ât, literally, 'because she is avoided, i.e.
because people avoid newly-confined women (not their
husbands).'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_905"></span>[180:21](sbe1444.htm#fr_905.md) E.g. Agastya and
Vasish*th*a. See Rig-veda VII, 33, 11, and Sâya*n*a's commentary
thereon.

<span id="fn_906"></span>[181:24](sbe1444.htm#fr_906.md) Vasish*th*a IV,
9-15. When the libations of water are poured out, the name of the
deceased must be pronounced. Govinda correctly states that iti, 'or the
like,' which stands after 'a coal, water,' is intended to include
'cowdung, and yellow mustard seed,' which are mentioned by Yâ*gñ*avalkya
III, 13. Regarding the clause sak*ri*ttri*h*, '(repeating these last
four acts) severally three times,' see Âpastamba II, 6, 15, 10.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[181:25](sbe1444.htm#fr_907.md) Vish*n*u XXI, 2
seq., and especially 19.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[181:26](sbe1444.htm#fr_908.md) Govinda, in
explanation of this Sûtra, refers to the last words of Âpastamba II, 6,
15, 10, where it is said that relatives shall perform those rites for
the dead which the women declare to be necessary,' and to Âpastamba II,
II, 29, 15.

<span id="fn_909"></span>[181:27](sbe1444.htm#fr_909.md) Gautama XIV, 20.
Govinda is of opinion that the duration of the impurity shall depend on
the good qualities, learning, &c. of the deceased.

<span id="fn_910"></span>[182:28](sbe1444.htm#fr_910.md) Vish*n*u XXII, 42,
44. Govinda asserts that the impurity on account of an Upâdhyâya lasts
one night, together with the preceding and following days, and on
account of a teacher's or Upâdhyâya's sons one day only. It looks as if
he had read the words pakshi*n*yekâham in his text.

<span id="fn_911"></span>[182:29](sbe1444.htm#fr_911.md) Govinda asserts
that ka, 'likewise,' indicates that the rule applies also on the death
of persons for whom one sacrifices.

<span id="fn_912"></span>[182:30](sbe1444.htm#fr_912.md) Vish*n*u XXII, 44.
Govinda explains satîrthya to mean 'one who has the same guru or
spiritual guide,' while according to others it means 'one who studies
under the same sub-teacher' (upâdhyâya). See also the Kâ*s*ikâ on
Pâ*n*ini IV, 4, 117, and note.

<span id="fn_913"></span>[182:31](sbe1444.htm#fr_913.md) Vish*n*u XXII, 25.
3233. Gautama XIV, 27.

<span id="fn_914"></span>[182:34](sbe1444.htm#fr_914.md) Vish*n*u XXII, 69.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[183:36](sbe1444.htm#fr_915.md) This verse, which
is another version of I, 5, 9, 5, is left out in the Dekhan and
Gu*g*arât MSS.; I consider its genuineness very doubtful.

<span id="fn_916"></span>[183:37](sbe1444.htm#fr_916.md) Vasish*th*a XVIII,
16.

<span id="fn_917"></span>[183:39](sbe1444.htm#fr_917.md)-40. Âpastamba I,
5, 15, 16-17. Govinda, too, states that the second mode of purification
is to be adopted, if the dog touches any part of the body below the
navel.

<span id="fn_918"></span>[183:41](sbe1444.htm#fr_918.md) Vasish*th*a XXIII,
31.
