### CHAPTER XV.

1\. Man formed of uterine blood and virile seed proceeds from his mother
and his father (as an effect) from its cause. <span
id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_445)

2\. (Therefore) the father and the mother have power to give, to sell,
and to abandon their (son).

3\. But let him not give or receive (in adoption) an only son; <span
id="fr_446"></span>[3](#fn_446)

4\. For he (must remain) to continue the line of the ancestors. <span
id="fr_447"></span>[4](#fn_447)

5\. Let a woman neither give nor receive a son except with her husband's
permission. <span id="fr_448"></span>[5](#fn_448)

6\. He who desires to adopt a son, shall assemble <span
id="fr_449"></span>[6](#fn_449)

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

his kinsmen, announce his intention to the king, make burnt-offerings in
the middle of the house, reciting the Vyâh*ri*tis, and take (as a son) a
not remote kinsman, just the nearest among his relatives.

7\. But if a doubt arises (with respect to an adopted son who is) a
remote kinsman, (the adopter) shall set him apart like a *S*ûdra. <span
id="fr_450"></span>[7](#fn_450)

8\. For it is declared in the Veda, 'Through one he saves many.' <span
id="fr_451"></span>[8](#fn_451)

9\. If, after an adoption has been made, a legitimate son be born, (the
adopted son) shall obtain a fourth part, <span
id="fr_452"></span>[9](#fn_452)

10\. Provided he be not engaged in (rites) procuring prosperity. <span
id="fr_453"></span>[10](#fn_453)

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

11\. He who divulges the Veda (to persons not authorised to study it),
he who sacrifices for *S*ûdras, (and all those) who have fallen from the
rank of the highest caste (shall be excommunicated by the ceremony of)
emptying the water-vessel. <span id="fr_454"></span>[11](#fn_454)

12\. A slave or the son of a wife of a lower caste, or a relative not
belonging to the same caste, who is destitute of good qualities, shall
fetch a broken pot from a heap of vessels unfit for use, place Ku*s*a
grass, the tops of which have been cut off, or Lohita grass (on the
ground), and empty the pot for the (outcast, overturning it) with his
left foot; <span id="fr_455"></span>[12](#fn_455)

13\. And the relatives of the (outcast), allowing their hair to hang
down, shall touch him who empties (the pot). <span
id="fr_456"></span>[13](#fn_456)

14\. Turning (when they leave) their left hands towards (that spot),
they may go home at pleasure. <span id="fr_457"></span>[14](#fn_457)

15\. Let them not afterwards admit the (excommunicated person) to sacred
rites. <span id="fr_458"></span>[15](#fn_458)

16\. Those who admit him to sacred rites become his equals.

17\. But outcasts who have performed (the prescribed) penance (may be)
readmitted.

18\. Now they quote also (the following verse):

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

\[paragraph continues\] 'Let him walk before those who readmit him, like
one gamboling and laughing. Let him walk behind those who excommunicate
him, like one weeping and sorrowing.'

19\. Those who strike their teacher, their mother, or their father may
be readmitted in the following manner, either after being pardoned by
the (persons offended) or after expiating their sin.

20\. Having filled a golden or an earthen vessel (with water taken) from
a sacred lake or river, they pour (the water) over him, (reciting the
three verses) 'Ye waters are' &c. <span id="fr_459"></span>[20](#fn_459)

21\. All the (other ceremonies to be performed on the) readmission of
one who has bathed (in this manner) have been explained by (those
ordained an) the birth of a son. <span id="fr_460"></span>[21](#fn_460)

boy as nearly related as possible, in the first instance a Sapi*nd*a, on
failure of such a one, .a Samânodaka or a Sagotra.

have him initiated nor employ him for any sacred rites.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[76:10](sbe1418.htm#fr_453) 'Rites procuring
prosperity,' i.e. *S*râddhas, expiatory rites, &c. See also above, III,
71, and Gautama XI, 17. According to K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita the estate is
in this case to be divided equally between the legitimate son and the
adopted son. An entirely <span id="page_77">p. 77</span> different
explanation, 'Provided (the estate) may not have been expended in acts
of merit,' is given Dattaka*k*andrikâ V, 17-18. It is doubtlessly
erroneous, for 'the estate' is nowhere mentioned in the preceding
Sûtras.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[77:11](sbe1418.htm#fr_454) Gautama XX, 1.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[77:12](sbe1418.htm#fr_455) Gautama XX, 4. 'For
the (outcast),' i.e. pronouncing his name, and saying, 'I deprive N. N.
of water.'

<span id="fn_456"></span>[77:13](sbe1418.htm#fr_456) Gautama XX, 5.
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita takes the Sûtra differently, but his explanation is
refuted by the parallel passage of Gautama and Haradatta's commentary
thereon.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[77:14](sbe1418.htm#fr_457) Gautama XX, 7.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[77:15](sbe1418.htm#fr_458) Gautama XX, 8-9.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[78:20](sbe1418.htm#fr_459) Gautama XX, 10-14.
I read 'pu*n*yahradât,' instead of 'pûr*n*âhradât,' as the MSS. and
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita have. The passage of the Veda referred to occurs
Rig-veda X, 9, I.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[78:21](sbe1418.htm#fr_460) I.e. the person
readmitted shall receive all the various sacraments just like a new-born
child.
