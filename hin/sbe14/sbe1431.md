### CHAPTER XXVIII.

1\. A woman is not defiled by a lover, nor a Brâhma*n*a by Vedic rites,
nor water by urine and ordure, nor fire by consuming (impure
substances). <span id="fr_700"></span>[1](#fn_700.md)

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

2-3. A wife, (though) tainted by sin, whether she be quarrelsome, or
have left the house, or have suffered criminal force, or have fallen
into the hands of thieves, must not be abandoned; to forsake her is not
prescribed (by the sacred law). Let him wait for the time of her
courses; by her temporary uncleanness she becomes pure. <span
id="fr_701"></span>[2](#fn_701.md)

4\. Women (possess) an unequalled means of purification; they never
become (entirely) foul. For month by month their temporary uncleanness
removes their sins. <span id="fr_702"></span>[4](#fn_702.md)

5\. Women belong first to three gods, Soma (the moon), the Gandharva,
and Fire, and come afterwards into the possession of men; according to
the law they cannot be contaminated. <span
id="fr_703"></span>[5](#fn_703.md)

6\. Soma gave them cleanliness, the Gandharva their melodious voice, and
Fire purity of all (limbs); therefore women are free from stains. <span
id="fr_704"></span>[6](#fn_704.md)

7\. Those versed in the sacred law state that there are three acts
(only) which make women outcasts, (viz.) the murder of the husband,
slaying a learned Brâhma*n*a, and the destruction of the fruit of their
womb. <span id="fr_705"></span>[7](#fn_705.md)

8\. A calf is pure when the milk flows, a bird when it causes fruit to
fall, women during dalliance, and a dog when he catches a deer. <span
id="fr_706"></span>[8](#fn_706.md)

9\. Pure is the mouth of a goat and of a horse, pure is the back of a
cow, pure are the feet of a Brâhma*n*a, but women are pure in all
(limbs) <span id="fr_707"></span>[9](#fn_707.md)

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

10\. I will now declare the purificatory texts (which are found) in each
Veda; by muttering them or reciting them at a burnt-oblation (men) are
doubtlessly cleansed (from sin). <span id="fr_708"></span>[10](#fn_708.md)

11\. (They are) the Aghamarsha*n*a, the Devak*ri*ta, the *S*uddhavatîs,
the Taratsamas, the *K*ûshmâ*nd*as, the Pâvamânîs, and the Durgâsâvitri;

12\. The Atîshaṅgas, the Padastobhas, and the Sâmans (called)
Vyâh*ri*ti, the Bhâru*nd*a Sâmans, the Gâyatra (Sâman), and the
Raivata; <span id="fr_709"></span>[12](#fn_709.md)

13\. The Purushavrata and the Bhâsa, and likewise the Devavrata
(Sâmans), the Abliṅga, the Bârhaspatya, the hymn addressed to Vâ*k*,
likewise the *Rik*as (called) Madhu; <span
id="fr_710"></span>[13](#fn_710.md)

14\. The *S*atarudriya, the Atharva*s*iras, the Trisupar*n*a, the
Mahâvrata, the Gosûkta, and the A*s*vasûkta, and the two Sâmans (called)
Suddhâ*s*uddhîya. <span id="fr_711"></span>[14](#fn_711.md)

15\. The three (Sâmans called) Â*g*yadohas, the Rathantara, the
Agnervrata, the Vâmadevya, and the B*ri*hat, being muttered, purify
(all) living beings. (He who sings them) may obtain the recollection of
former existences, if he desires it.

16\. Gold is the firstborn of Fire, through Vish*n*u exists the earth,
and the cows are children of the

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Sun; he who bestows as gifts gold, a cow, and
land will obtain rewards without end for them.

17\. A cow, a horse, gold, (and) land, bestowed on an unlearned
Brâhma*n*a who neglects his sacred duties, prevent the giver (from
attaining heaven). <span id="fr_712"></span>[17](#fn_712.md)

18-19. (If he presents), on the full moon of the month of Vai*s*âkha,
(to) seven or five Brâhma*n*as, black or white sesamum grains (mixed)
with honey, (saying), 'May the king of justice (Yama) rejoice!' or
(expressing) some other (wish) which he may have in his mind, the guilt
which he has incurred during his (whole) life will instantly vanish.

20\. But hear (now) the reward of the merit acquired by that man who
gives the skin of a black antelope, to which the hoofs are (still)
attached and the navel of which is adorned with gold, covering it with
sesamum grains. <span id="fr_713"></span>[20](#fn_713.md)

21\. 'Without doubt he has bestowed (through that gift) the four-faced
earth, together with its caves filled with gold, and together with its
mountains, groves, and forests.' <span id="fr_714"></span>[21](#fn_714.md)

22\. He who, placing on the skin of a black antelope, sesamum, gold,
honey, and butter, gives it to a Brâhma*n*a, overcomes all sin.'
