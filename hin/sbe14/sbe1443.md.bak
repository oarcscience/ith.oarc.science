### PRA*S*NA I, ADHYÂYA 5, KA*ND*IKÂ 10.

1\. 'A drop of water which is allowed to fall (on the ground) purifies a
bull's hide of land, whether (the land) has been (previously) swept or
not, provided no impure substance is visible on it.' <span
id="fr_865"></span>[1](#fn_865.md)

2\. Food which is cooked out of sight must be illuminated (with fire)
and be sprinkled with water, <span id="fr_866"></span>[2](#fn_866.md)

3\. Likewise eatables bought in the market. <span
id="fr_867"></span>[3](#fn_867.md)

4\. For the Veda (declares), 'For the gods who are (easily) disgusted
and desirous of purity do not

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

enjoy the offerings made by a man destitute of faith.'

5\. After reflecting (for a, long time on the respective value of) the
(food) of a pure man destitute of faith and of an impure person who has
faith, the gods declared both to be equal. But the Lord of created
beings said to them, 'That is not equal, it is unequal. The food of a
man destitute of faith is worthless, that which is purified by faith is
preferable.'

6\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Want of faith is the
greatest sin; for faith is the highest austerity. Therefore the gods do
not eat offerings given without faith.'

7\. 'A foolish man does not reach heaven, though he may offer
(sacrifices) or give (gifts).'

8\. 'He is called a foolish man whose conduct is blemished by doubts,
and who, clinging to his own fancies, transgresses (the rules of) the
*S*âstras, because he opposes the fulfilment of the sacred law.' <span
id="fr_868"></span>[8](#fn_868.md)

9\. But pot-herbs, flowers, fruit, roots, and annual plants (must be)
sprinkled (with water). <span id="fr_869"></span>[9](#fn_869.md)

10\. Having placed dry grass, wood of trees unfit for sacrifices or a
clod of earth (on the ground), let him void faeces or urine, turning his
face during the day towards the north and at night towards the south and
wrapping up his head. <span id="fr_870"></span>[10](#fn_870.md)

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

11\. (After voiding) urine he shall clean (the organ once) with earth
and water, <span id="fr_871"></span>[11](#fn_871.md)

12\. The hand three times.

13\. In like manner (he shall clean himself with earth and water after
voiding) faeces. <span id="fr_872"></span>[13](#fn_872.md)

14\. The number (of the applications of both is) thrice three for both
feet and the hand.

15\. After an effusion of semen (he shall purify himself) in the same
manner as after voiding urine. <span id="fr_873"></span>[15](#fn_873.md)

16\. He shall wash himself, after he has untied or put on the cloth
round his loins, <span id="fr_874"></span>[16](#fn_874.md)

17\. Or he may touch moist grass, cowdung, or earth. <span
id="fr_875"></span>[17](#fn_875.md)

18\. While he is engaged in (the performance of) religious rites, he
shall avoid to touch (the part of his body) below the navel. <span
id="fr_876"></span>[18](#fn_876.md)

19\. The Veda (declares), 'A man's (body) is pure above the navel, it is
impure below the navel.' <span id="fr_877"></span>[19](#fn_877.md)

20\. *S*ûdras living in the service of Âryans shall trim (their hair and
nails) every month; their mode <span id="fr_878"></span>[20](#fn_878.md)

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

of sipping water (shall be) the same as that of Âryans.

21\. A Vai*s*ya may live by usury. <span
id="fr_879"></span>[21](#fn_879.md)

22\. But (a sum of) twenty-five (kârshâpa*n*as shall bear an interest)
of five mâshas (per mensem). <span id="fr_880"></span>[22](#fn_880.md)

23\. Now they quote also (the following verses) 'He who, acquiring
property cheap, employs (it so that it yields) a higher price, is called
a usurer, and blamed in all (treatises on) the sacred law.' '(Brahman)
weighed in the scales the crime of killing a learned Brâhma*n*a against
(the crime of) usury; the slayer of the Brâhma*n*a remained at the top,
the usurer sank downwards.' <span id="fr_881"></span>[23](#fn_881.md)

24\. 'Let him treat Brâhma*n*as who tend cattle, those who live by
trade, (and) those who are artisans, actors (and bards), servants or
usurers, like *S*ûdras.' <span id="fr_882"></span>[24](#fn_882.md)

25\. But men of the first two castes may, at their pleasure, lend (money
at interest) to one who neglects his sacred duties, to a miser, to an
atheist, or to a very wicked man. <span id="fr_883"></span>[25](#fn_883.md)

26\. Through the neglect of sacrifices, of (lawful) marriages, of the
study of the Veda, and of (learned) Brâhma*n*as, (noble) families (even)
are degraded. <span id="fr_884"></span>[26](#fn_884.md)

27\. The offence of neglecting a Brâhma*n*a cannot be committed against
a fool who is unacquainted <span id="fr_885"></span>[27](#fn_885.md)

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

with the Veda. For (in offering sacrifices) one does not pass by a
brilliant fire and throw the oblations into ashes.

28\. Families which are deficient in (the knowledge of) the Veda, are
degraded by (keeping) cows, horses and vehicles, by agriculture and by
serving the king. <span id="fr_886"></span>[28](#fn_886.md)

29\. But even poor families which are rich in (the knowledge of) the
Veda obtain rank among the (noble) families and gain great fame.

30\. The (study of) the Veda impedes (the pursuit of) agriculture, (the
pursuit of) agriculture impedes (the study of) the Veda. He who is able
(to do it), may attend to both; but he who is unable (to attend to
both), shall give up agriculture.

31\. A fat, bellowing, raging humped bull, who does not restrain
himself, who hurts living creatures and speaks according to his
pleasure, forsooth, does not reach the (abode of) the gods; (but) those
who are small like atoms, (being) emaciated (by austerities and fasts),
go thither.

32\. If, erring, in his youth he commits at any time good or evil acts
of any kind, (they will all remain without result). (For) if in his
later age he lives righteously, he will obtain (the reward of) that
(virtuous conduct) alone, not (the punishments of his former) crimes.

33\. Let him always be sorrowing in his heart, when he thinks of his
sins, (let him) practise austerities and be careful; thus he will be
freed from sin.

34\. 'Where drops of water touch the feet of a <span
id="fr_887"></span>[34](#fn_887.md)

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

man who offers water for sipping to others, no defilement is caused by
them. They are equally (pure) as (water) collected on the ground.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_865"></span>[172:1](sbe1443.htm#fr_865.md) **10**. Regarding
the term 'a bull's hide' of land, see Vish*n*u V, 181-183, XCII, 4.

<span id="fn_866"></span>[172:2](sbe1443.htm#fr_866.md) Âpastamba II, 2, 3,
9. 'Out of sight,' i.e. not before the eyes of him who eats
it.'--Govinda. It would, however, seem that this rule refers to food
prepared by *S*ûdras, without the super-visions of Âryans. For
Âpastamba's Sûtra, which contains the same word, paroksham, 'out of
sight,' certainly has reference to that case only, and there is no
reason why food prepared by Brahman cooks should be purified before it
is eaten.

<span id="fn_867"></span>[172:3](sbe1443.htm#fr_867.md) Âpastamba I, 5, 17,
19. The eatables here intended are, according to Govinda, Lâ*d*us and
other sweet-meats which are frequently bought ready made.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[173:8](sbe1443.htm#fr_868.md) Dharmatantra,
translated 'the fulfilment of the sacred law,' is explained in the
commentary by dharmasya tantram anush*th*ânam, by 'the performance of
the sacred duties.' It may also mean 'the doctrine of or the treatises
on the sacred law.' The *S*âstras are the Vedas and the whole body of
the sacred literature.

<span id="fn_869"></span>[173:9](sbe1443.htm#fr_869.md) Vish*n*u XXIII, 15.

<span id="fn_870"></span>[173:10](sbe1443.htm#fr_870.md) Vasish*th*a, VI,
10.

<span id="fn_871"></span>[174:11](sbe1443.htm#fr_871.md)-12. Vasish*th*a
VI, 14, 18. According to Govinda one application of water suffices for
the left hand and two for both together.

<span id="fn_872"></span>[174:13](sbe1443.htm#fr_872.md)-14. Vasish*th*a
VI, 18. Govinda reads in Sûtra 14, against the authority of all the
MSS., pâyo*h*, 'for the anus,' instead of pâdayo*h*, 'for both feet.'

<span id="fn_873"></span>[174:15](sbe1443.htm#fr_873.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
15, 23.

<span id="fn_874"></span>[174:16](sbe1443.htm#fr_874.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
16, 14.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[174:17](sbe1443.htm#fr_875.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
16, 15.

<span id="fn_876"></span>[174:18](sbe1443.htm#fr_876.md) Vish*n*u XXIII,
51.

<span id="fn_877"></span>[174:19](sbe1443.htm#fr_877.md) Taittirîya
Sa*m*hitâ VI, 1, 3, 4.

<span id="fn_878"></span>[174:20](sbe1443.htm#fr_878.md) Âpastamba II, 1,
2, 4-5. The above translation follows Govinda's explanation. But
âryâdhish*th*itâ*h*, 'living in the service of Âryans,' may also mean
'superintended by Âryans,' and the rule be taken to refer to the special
case of *S*ûdra cooks, as in the parallel passage of Âpastamba.

<span id="fn_879"></span>[175:21](sbe1443.htm#fr_879.md) Vasish*th*a II,
19.

<span id="fn_880"></span>[175:22](sbe1443.htm#fr_880.md) Vasish*th*a II,
51.

<span id="fn_881"></span>[175:23](sbe1443.htm#fr_881.md) Vasish*th*a II,
41-42.

<span id="fn_882"></span>[175:24](sbe1443.htm#fr_882.md) Vasish*th*a III,
3.

<span id="fn_883"></span>[175:25](sbe1443.htm#fr_883.md) Vasish*th*a II,
43. M. reads na dadyâtâm, shall not lend.' According to Govinda, 'a very
wicked man' is equivalent to 'a *S*ûdra.'

<span id="fn_884"></span>[175:26](sbe1443.htm#fr_884.md) Manu III, 63.
Govinda says that this Sûtra is introduced in connexion with the
expression, 'one who neglects his sacred duties,' which occurs in Sûtra
25.

<span id="fn_885"></span>[175:27](sbe1443.htm#fr_885.md) Vasish*th*a III, 9
note, 10. This Sûtra is added in explanation of the term 'the offence of
neglecting a Brâhma*n*a.'

<span id="fn_886"></span>[176:28](sbe1443.htm#fr_886.md)-29. Manu III, 64,
66.

<span id="fn_887"></span>[176:34](sbe1443.htm#fr_887.md) Vasish*th*a III,
42.
