### PRA*S*NA II, ADHYÂYA 8, KA*ND*IKÂ 15.

1\. Now indeed (that) happens (also which the following verses teach):

2\. 'Let him sprinkle that food with the remainder of the burnt
oblations. But what is given without (touching it with) the thumb does
not gladden the manes.' <span id="fr_1281"></span>[2](#fn_1281.md)

3\. 'The malevolent Asuras seek an opportunity (to snatch away) that
food intended for the manes, which is not supported with both
hands.' <span id="fr_1282"></span>[3](#fn_1282.md)

4\. 'The Yâtudhânas and Pi*s*â*k*as, who receive no share, steal the
food if sesamum grains are not scattered (on the seats of the guests),
and the Asuras (take it) if (the host) is under the sway of
anger.' <span id="fr_1283"></span>[4](#fn_1283.md)

5\. 'If a person dressed in reddish clothes mutters prayers, offers
burnt oblations, or receives gifts, the sacrificial viands, offered at
sacrifices to the gods or to the manes, do not reach the deities.' <span
id="fr_1284"></span>[5](#fn_1284.md)

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

6\. 'If gifts are given or received without (touching them with) the
thumb and, if one sips water standing, (the performer of the act) is not
benefited thereby.'

7\. At the beginning and at the end (of a *S*râddha) water must be
giver. (to the guests). <span id="fr_1285"></span>[7](#fn_1285.md)

8\. In every case the muttering (of sacred texts) and the other
(necessary acts must be performed) according to the rule.

9\. The remaining (rules) have been prescribed (in the section) on the
burnt oblations on Ash*t*akâ (days). <span
id="fr_1286"></span>[9](#fn_1286.md)

10\. 'He shall feed two (Brâhma*n*as) at the offering to the gods and
three at the offering to the manes, or a single man on either occasion.
Even a very wealthy man shall not be anxious (to entertain) a large
company.' <span id="fr_1287"></span>[10](#fn_1287.md)

11\. 'A large company destroys these five (advantages), the respectful
treatment (of the invited guests, the propriety of) time and place,
purity and (the selection of) virtuous Brâhma*n*a (guests); therefore he
shall not invite (a large number).'

12\. 'In front (feed) the fathers of the (sacrificer), to the left the
grandfathers, to the right the great-grandfathers, and at the back those
who pare off (portions) from the cakes.' <span
id="fr_1288"></span>[12](#fn_1288.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1281"></span>[269:2](sbe1469.htm#fr_1281.md) **15**. Manu III,
215. See also above, II, 8, 14, 10.

<span id="fn_1282"></span>[269:3](sbe1469.htm#fr_1282.md) Vasish*th*a XI,
25.

<span id="fn_1283"></span>[269:4](sbe1469.htm#fr_1283.md) Vish*n*u LXXIII,
x a; Manu III, 229.

<span id="fn_1284"></span>[269:5](sbe1469.htm#fr_1284.md) Govinda states
that the rule is intended to teach that the sacrificer and the guests at
a *S*râddha must be dressed in white, <span id="page_270">p. 270</span>
and that ascetics are not to be invited. But see Vasish*th*a XI, 17, 34.

<span id="fn_1285"></span>[270:7](sbe1469.htm#fr_1285.md) Vish*n*u LXXIII,
12, 27, and above, II, 8, 14, 6.

<span id="fn_1286"></span>[270:9](sbe1469.htm#fr_1286.md) Baudhâyana
G*ri*hya-sûtra II, 17, 18.

<span id="fn_1287"></span>[270:10](sbe1469.htm#fr_1287.md)-11. Vasish*th*a
XI, 27-28.

<span id="fn_1288"></span>[270:12](sbe1469.htm#fr_1288.md) In the beginning
of the verse I read with M. and the I. O. copy of the commentary
urasta*h* pitaras tasya, and in the end with the Dekhan and Gu*g*arât
MSS. pi*nd*atakshakâ*h*. M. reads pi*nd*atarkyâ, and the copies of the
commentary pi*nd*odakâ*h*. Both these <span id="page_271">p. 271</span>
readings are clearly corrupt, and so is the var. lect. of the
G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha, quoted in the Petersburg Dictionary,
pi*nd*atarkukâ*h*. Pi*nd*atakshakâ*h*, 'the cutters or parers of the
cakes,' is appropriate, because the remoter ancestors, who, as Govinda
too declares, are meant by the term, obtain the fragments of the funeral
cakes.
