### PRA*S*NA III, ADHYÂYA 9.

1\. Now, therefore, we will explain the rule of the Ana*s*natpârâya*n*a
(recitation of the whole Veda during a fast).

2\. Let him wear a clean garment or a dress made of bark (or
grass). <span id="fr_1386"></span>[2](#fn_1386.md)

3\. Let him desire food, fit for a sacrifice, or water and fruit. <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[3](#fn_1387.md)

4\. Going forth from the village in an easterly or northerly direction,
smearing a quadrangular stha*nd*ila, 'a bull's hide' in size, with
cowdung, sprinkling it, drawing the marks on it, sprinkling it with
water, heaping fuel on the fire and scattering (Ku*s*a grass) around it,
he offers burnt oblations to the following deities, to Agni Svâhâ, to
Pra*g*âpati <span id="fr_1388"></span>[4](#fn_1388.md)

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Svâhâ, to Soma Svâhâ, to all the gods Svâhâ, to
Svaya*m*bhu, to the *Rik*as, to the Ya*g*us, to the Sâmans, to the
Atharvans, to faith, to right knowledge, to wisdom, to fortune, to
modesty, to Savit*ri*, to the Sâvitrî (verse), to Sadasaspati, and to
Anumati.

5\. Having offered (these oblations), he must begin with the beginning
of the Veda and continuously recite (it).

6\. Let him not interrupt (the recitation) by talking, nor by
stopping, <span id="fr_1389"></span>[6](#fn_1389.md)

7\. Now if he converses in between or stops, let him thrice suppress his
breath, and begin just there where he left off.

8\. If he has forgotten (a passage), he shall recite for as long a time
as he does not recollect it, what (he may know, *Ri*k-verses) for
*Ri*k-verses, (Ya*g*us-formulas) for Ya*g*us-formulas, (Sâmans) for
Sâmans.

9\. He may (also) recite the Brâhma*n*a of that (forgotten passage) or
(the passage from the Anukrama*n*î regarding) its metre and its deities.

10\. Let him recite the Sa*m*hitâ of (his) Veda twelve (times). He
thereby removes (faults committed by) studying on forbidden (days, by)
angering his teacher, (and through) improper acts. His (knowledge of
the) Veda is sanctified, is purified.

11\. (If he reads) more than that, a cumulation (of rewards will be the
result).

12\. If he recites the Sa*m*hitâ of the Veda another twelve (times), he
gains thereby the world of U*s*anas.

13\. If he recites the Sa*m*hitâ of the Veda another

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

twelve (times), he gains thereby the world of B*ri*haspati.

14\. If he recites the Sa*m*hitâ of the Veda another twelve (times), he
gains thereby the world of Pra*g*âpati.

15\. If, fasting, he recites the Sa*m*hitâ one thou-sand (times), he
becomes one with Brahman, resplendent like Brahman (and) Brahman
(itself).

16\. If he subsists during a year on food obtained by begging, he gains
(the power of) supernatural vision.

17\. If during six months he subsists on barley-gruel, during four
months on water and barley-flour, during two months on fruit, (and)
during one month on water, or performs K*rikkh*ra penances of twelve
days, he (obtains the power of) suddenly disappearing, and sanctifies
seven descendants, seven ancestors, and himself as the fifteenth, and
(any) company (of Brâhma*n*as) which he may enter.

18\. They call that the ladder of the gods. <span
id="fr_1390"></span>[18](#fn_1390.md)

19\. By means of that the gods reached their divine station and the
sages the position of *Ri*shis.

20\. The periods for beginning this sacrifice, forsooth, are three, the
time of the morning libation, the time of the midday libation, and the
last part of the night, (the Muhûrta) sacred to Brahman.

21\. Pra*g*âpati, forsooth, proclaimed this (rite) to the seven
*Ri*shis, the seven *Ri*shis to Mahâ*g*a*gñ*u, and Mahâ*g*a*gñ*u to the
Brâhma*n*as. <span id="fr_1391"></span>[21](#fn_1391.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1386"></span>[307:2](sbe1481.htm#fr_1386.md) **9**. M. and the
MSS. of the commentary read *k*iravâsâ*h* instead of *k*îravâsâ*h*,'
clad with a garment of bark or grass,' and Govinda explains the var.
lect. by 'dressed in old clothes.'

<span id="fn_1387"></span>[307:3](sbe1481.htm#fr_1387.md) This rule refers
to the case only where the performer of the vow is unable to bear the
prolonged fasting.

<span id="fn_1388"></span>[307:4](sbe1481.htm#fr_1388.md) A stha*nd*ila is
the raised mound, four fingers high, which is used as the altar for the
G*ri*hya ceremonies. Regarding the term, 'a bull's hide,' see Vish*n*u
XCII, 2. The marks (laksha*n*a) are the lines which must be drawn on the
altar; see e.g. Â*s*valâyana G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 3, 1.

<span id="fn_1389"></span>[308:6](sbe1481.htm#fr_1389.md) 'By talking, i.e.
by uttering words not connected with the Veda.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1390"></span>[309:18](sbe1481.htm#fr_1390.md) Govinda explains
ni*hs*re*n*îm, 'the ladder,' by ni*hs*reyasahetum, 'a cause of supreme
bliss.'

<span id="fn_1391"></span>[309:21](sbe1481.htm#fr_1391.md) The name of the
*Ri*shi who proclaimed it to the Brâhmans is not certain. The Dekhan
MSS. read Mahâ*g*agru and Mahâ*g*agnu, M. Mahâ*g*a*gñ*u, the I. O. copy
of the commentary Mahâya*gñ*u and Mahâ*g*a*gñ*u, and the Telugu copy
Mahâ*g*a*gñ*u.
