### PRA*S*NA IV, ADHYÂYA 8.

1\. He who, through excessive greed or carelessness, performs this rite
for others, is tainted by sin, and perishes like one who has swallowed
poison.

2\. A Brâhma*n*a who performs this rite for his teacher, his father, his
mother, or for himself is resplendent like the sun. Therefore this rite
may be performed for those (persons).

3\. Ka (Pra*g*âpati) purified by means of this rite the god with a
thousand eyes (Sahasrâksha), Fire, Wind, the Sun, Soma, Yama, and other
lords of the gods.

4\. Whatever there is in these three worlds, famed as possessing a holy
name, Brâhma*n*as and the rest, (all) that was produced by Ka through
this rite of sanctification.

5\. This sin-destroying secret of Pra*g*âpati was first produced;
thereafter thousands of purificatory rites .came into existence. <span

6\. He who performs those eight Ga*n*ahomas on the (first) day of the
year, of a half-year, of a season, or of a fortnight, sanctifies ten
ancestors and ten descendants of his line;

7\. And, while still on earth, he is known to the

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

gods in heaven as a holy man, and (after death) that virtuous man
rejoices for a very long time in heaven like a god.

8\. If a Brâhma*n*a is unable to offer those eight Ga*n*ahomas, let him
offer one; thereby his guilt is effaced.

9\. He, also, whose sons or pupils offer those eight Ga*n*ahomas, is
freed from his sin which is bought off by his having instructed (them).

10\. Through a desire of removing one's guilt one even may cause (these
oblations) to be offered by men who have been engaged for money, in case
oneself is unable (to do it); a man need not torment himself. <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[10](#fn_1463.md)

11\. Even among the virtuous a distribution of wealth is made (for the
success) of holy rites; some-times a man who is free from debt is
(thereby) freed from guilt.

12, Liberated according to this rule from the ocean of guilt and debt,
he considers himself pure and able to successfully perform the sacred
rites.

13\. But in the case of that pure mortal who, freed from all sin and
debts, begins the sacred rites, they will succeed without any effort.

14\. Let him daily (study and) teach this holy (rule) of Pra*g*âpati,
which the sage has proclaimed, let him remember it or hear it. (By doing
that) he is freed from all guilt and will be exalted in Brahman's world.

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

15\. Let him mutter during twelve days those sacred texts through which
he wishes to accomplish (his desires), eating once (a day) at night
boiled rice with clarified butter, with milk, or with sour milk.

16\. (Let him offer) ten times a burnt oblation and sprinkle clarified
butter. (That is) the preliminary worship (which must be performed) when
one desires to accomplish one's objects through those sacred texts.

<span id="fn_1462"></span>[331:5](sbe1490.htm#fr_1462.md) **8**. I.e. those
mentioned V, 7, 5.

<span id="fn_1463"></span>[332:10](sbe1490.htm#fr_1463.md) The meaning is
that in case a wealthy man is unable to bear 'the restraints,' he may
hire others to perform the Homas. Though the hired performer will be
guilty of a serious offence (Sûtra 1), the person who causes them to be
performed will derive benefit from them.
