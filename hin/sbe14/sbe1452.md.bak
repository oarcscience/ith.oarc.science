### PRA*S*NA I, ADHYÂYA 10, KA*ND*IKÂ 19.

1\. For slaying a Kshatriya (the offender) shall <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[1](#fn_1007.md)

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

give to the king one thousand cows and besides a bull in expiation of
his sin,

2\. For (slaying) a Vai*s*ya one hundred cows, for (slaying) a *S*ûdra
ten; and a bull (must be) added (in each case). <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[2](#fn_1008.md)

3\. (The punishment for) the murder of a woman--excepting a (Brâhma*n*î)
who had bathed after temporary uncleanness--and for the destruction of a
cow have been explained by the (rule regarding the) murder of a
*S*ûdra. <span id="fr_1009"></span>[3](#fn_1009.md)

4\. If he has slain a milch-cow or a draught-ox, he shall perform a
*K*ândrâya*n*a (lunar penance) after (paying the prescribed fine).

5\. The (punishment for the) murder of a (Brâhma*n*î) who had bathed
after temporary uncleanness has been explained by (the rule regarding)
the murder of a Kshatriya. <span id="fr_1010"></span>[5](#fn_1010.md)

6\. For killing a flamingo, a Bhâsa, a peacock, a Brâhma*n*î duck, a
Pra*k*alâka, a crow, an owl, a frog, a musk-rat, a dog, (the large
ichneumon called) Babhru, a common ichneumon, and so forth, (the
offender shall pay) the same (fine) as (for the murder of) a
*S*ûdra. <span id="fr_1011"></span>[6](#fn_1011.md)

7\. In order to gain the good opinion of men, a witness shall give
evidence in accordance with what he has seen or heard. <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[7](#fn_1012.md)

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

8\. Of injustice (in decisions) one quarter falls on the party in the
cause, one quarter on his witnesses, one quarter on all the judges, and
one quarter on the king. <span id="fr_1013"></span>[8](#fn_1013.md)

But where he who deserves condemnation is condemned, the king is
guiltless and the judges free from blame; the guilt falls on the
offender (alone).

9\. (Therefore) a wise man should ask an appointed witness in the
following manner: <span id="fr_1014"></span>[9](#fn_1014.md)

10\. 'The merit which thou hast acquired in the interval between the
night in which thou wast born and that in which thou wilt die, all that
will go to the king, if thou speakest an untruth.' <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[10](#fn_1015.md)

11\. 'A witness who speaks falsely, slays three fathers and three
grandfathers and seven (descendants), both the born and the
unborn.' <span id="fr_1016"></span>[11](#fn_1016.md)

12\. 'By false testimony concerning gold he kills three ancestors; by
false testimony regarding (small) cattle he kills five; by false
testimony concerning kine he kills ten.' <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[12](#fn_1017.md)

'He kills a hundred by false evidence regarding horses, (and) a thousand
by false evidence concerning a man. A witness Who speaks falsely,
destroys the whole (world) by false evidence concerning land.'

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

13\. (Men of) the four castes (var*n*a) who have sons may be witnesses
excepting *S*rotriyas, the king, ascetics, and those who are destitute
of human (intellect). <span id="fr_1018"></span>[13](#fn_1018.md)

14\. If (the witness rightly) recollects (the facts of) the case (he
will receive) commendation from the most eminent men. <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[14](#fn_1019.md)

15\. In the contrary case (he will) fall into hell. <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[15](#fn_1020.md)

16\. Let him (who has given false evidence), drink hot milk during
twelve (days and) nights or offer burnt oblations (reciting) the
Kûshmâ*nd*a (texts). <span id="fr_1021"></span>[16](#fn_1021.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1007"></span>[201:1](sbe1452.htm#fr_1007.md) **19**. Âpastamba
I, 9, 24, I. Govinda explains vairaniryâtanârtham <span id="page_201">p.
201</span> in two ways: 1. in expiation of his sin; 2. in order to
remove the enmity of the relatives of the murdered man. He adds all
these punishments are really penances (prâya*sk*ittas) to be imposed by
the king. Âpastamba has these Sûtras in the section on penances.

<span id="fn_1008"></span>[202:2](sbe1452.htm#fr_1008.md) Âpastamba I, 9,
24, 2-4.

<span id="fn_1009"></span>[202:3](sbe1452.htm#fr_1009.md) Âpastamba I, 9,
24, 5; I, 9, 26, I.

<span id="fn_1010"></span>[202:5](sbe1452.htm#fr_1010.md) Vasish*th*a XX,
34, 37.

<span id="fn_1011"></span>[202:6](sbe1452.htm#fr_1011.md) Âpastamba I, 9,
25, 13.

<span id="fn_1012"></span>[202:7](sbe1452.htm#fr_1012.md) Vish*n*u VIII,
13-14.

<span id="fn_1013"></span>[203:8](sbe1452.htm#fr_1013.md) Manu VIII, 18-19.

<span id="fn_1014"></span>[203:9](sbe1452.htm#fr_1014.md) I read, with the
Telugu copy of the commentary, sâkshi*n*a*m* tvevam uddish*t*am. All the
MSS. of the text and C. I. read sâkshi*n*a*m* daivam uddish*t*am.
Govinda's explanation, adhunâ nirdish*t*ân sâkshi*n*a evam pri*kkh*ed
iti padânvaya*h*, 'the construction of the words is, "let him now ask
the appointed witnesses in the following manner," agrees with the
reading adopted.

<span id="fn_1015"></span>[203:10](sbe1452.htm#fr_1015.md) Vasish*th*a XVI,
32-53.

<span id="fn_1016"></span>[203:11](sbe1452.htm#fr_1016.md) 'Three fathers
and three grandfathers,' i.e. seven ancestors.

<span id="fn_1017"></span>[203:12](sbe1452.htm#fr_1017.md) Vasish*th*a XVI,
34. Regarding the explanation of the <span id="page_204">p. 204</span>
words 'he kills,' see Manu VIII, 97, and Haradatta on Gautama XIII, 14.

<span id="fn_1018"></span>[204:13](sbe1452.htm#fr_1018.md) Vasish*th*a XVI,
28-30. The text has râ*g*anya, 'members of the royal family.' But the
parallel passages of other Dharma-sûtras, e*g*. Vish*n*u VIII, 2, make
it probable that the king is meant.

<span id="fn_1019"></span>[204:14](sbe1452.htm#fr_1019.md) Âpastamba II,
11, 29, 10. Govinda takes the Sûtra differently. His commentary runs as
follows: sâkshidvaye sati râ*gñ*â, tatpurushai*s* *k*a ki*m* kartavyam
ity ata âha \|\| srim*ri*tau pradhânata*h* pratipatti*h* \|\|
prâdhânyatas taponirdish*t*avidyâdibhi*h* \| tadva*k*anât pratipattir
ni*sk*aya*h* kârya ityadhyâhâra*h* kârya*h* \|\| 'What shall the king
and his officers do, if there are two witnesses? In order to answer this
question he says: "On recollection, according to pre-eminence,
reliance." According to pre-eminence, i.e. on account of austerities,
(being) appointed (as a witness), learning and the like; in accordance
with the evidence of such person's conviction. i.e. the decision must be
made. The latter word has to be understood.' Govinda then goes on to
quote Manu VIII, 73.

<span id="fn_1020"></span>[204:15](sbe1452.htm#fr_1020.md) Âpastamba II,
It, 29, 9. Govinda and M. read kart*ri*patyam for kartapatyam, the
reading of the Dekhan and Gu*g*arât MSS. The explanation of the former
term is said to be dosha*h*, 'sin.' Regarding the ancient word
kartapatya, which Govinda and the writer of M. have not understood, see
Haradatta on Âpastamba I, 2, 5, 3.

<span id="fn_1021"></span>[204:16](sbe1452.htm#fr_1021.md) In accordance
with his explanation of Sûtra 14, Govinda thinks that this penance is to
be performed by the king and the judges in case they fail to weigh the
evidence properly. But <span id="page_205">p. 205</span> according to
Manu VIII, 106, Vish*n*u VIII, 16, the oblations with the Kûshmâ*nd*as
(Taitt. Âr. X, 3-5) are to be offered for uttering in evidence a venial
falsehood. That is, no doubt, here, too, the real meaning.
