### PRA*S*NA III, ADHYÂYA 8.

1\. Now, therefore, we will explain the rule of the *K*ândrâya*n*a
(lunar penance). <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1](#fn_1374.md)

2\. Let him fast on the fourteenth day of the bright half of the month.

3\. Having had the hair on his head, his beard, the hair on his body,
and his nails, or his beard alone, cut, let him enter, dressed, in new
clothes and speaking the truth, the place where the sacrificial fire is
preserved.

4\. There a (common) fire, (which may be) fetched once (only, shall
serve) him; or (the fire) must be produced by friction with the
Ara*n*is. <span id="fr_1375"></span>[4](#fn_1375.md)

5\. Let a student, who is a friend (of the performer), be ready at hand
to (carry out his) directions;

6\. And sacrificial viands (shall be his) food during the performance of
the vow.

7\. Having heaped fuel on the fire, scattered (Ku*s*a grass) around it,
and performed (the ceremonies) up to the end of the Agnimukha, he offers
burnt oblations, (cutting off portions) from the cooked food,

8\. (The first) to Agni, (the second) to the lunar day whichever it may
be, (the third and the fourth) <span id="fr_1376"></span>[8](#fn_1376.md)

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

to the lunar mansion together with its guardian deity, the fifth to the
moon (with the verse), 'Atrâha gor amanvata,' the sixth to the sky and
the earth, the seventh to day and night, the eighth to Rudra, the ninth
to the sun, the tenth to Varu*n*a, the eleventh to Indra, and the
twelfth to all the gods.

9\. Now they mention (the following) other (oblations which are to be
offered) to the points of the horizon and to their (guardian) deities,
to the wide middle sphere and to its (guardian) deity.

10\. Having offered (the oblation) to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t (with the
verse), 'Ever new,' &c., he then places the remainder of the sacrificial
viands into a goblet (ka*m*sa) or a cup (*k*amasa), pours seasoning,
that is fit for sacrifices, over them, and eats fifteen morsels of
ordinary size, <span id="fr_1377"></span>[10](#fn_1377.md)

11\. The first (saying, 'I offer) thee to Prâ*n*a,' the second (saying,'
I offer) thee to Apâna,' the third (saying, 'I offer) thee to Vyâna,'
the fourth (saying, 'I offer) thee to Udâna,' the fifth (saying, 'I
offer) thee to Samâna.' If there are only four (mouthfuls, he eats) the
first reciting two (texts); if there are three, (he eats) the first two
reciting two (texts) with each; if there are two, (he eats) the first
reciting two (texts and) the second reciting three texts; (if, there is
only) one, (he recites) all (the five texts) together. <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[11](#fn_1378.md)

12\. Having drunk water (with the text), 'Thou <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[12](#fn_1379.md)

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

art water used for moistening Soma,' &c., he then offers the (following)
additional oblations of clarified butter, with the seven Anuvâkas
(beginning), 'May my Prâ*n*a, Apâna, Vyâna, Udâna, and Samâna be
purified;' 'May my voice, mind, eye, ear,' &c.; 'May my head, hands,
feet;' 'May my skin;' 'May the sense of hearing, touch;' 'May earth,
water;' 'May that which consists of food.'

13\. (The ceremonies) beginning with the muttering (of sacred texts) and
ending with the gift of a cow as a fee are known. <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[13](#fn_1380.md)

14\. He worships the sun with (three verses) ad--dressed to Sûrya and
the moon with (three verses) addressed to *K*andramas. <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[14](#fn_1381.md)

15\. When he goes to rest, he mutters (the verse), 'O fire, keep thou
good watch,' <span id="fr_1382"></span>[15](#fn_1382.md)

16\. When he awakes (in the morning, the verse), 'O fire, thou art the
protector of vows.' <span id="fr_1383"></span>[16](#fn_1383.md)

17\. Let him not talk with women and *S*ûdras addressing them first; let
him not look at urine and ordure.

18\. If he has seen any impure substance, he mutters (the text),
'Unrestrained (was) the internal organ, wretched my eye; the sun is the
most <span id="fr_1384"></span>[18](#fn_1384.md)

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

excellent among the lights of heaven; O initiation, mayest thou not
forsake me.'

19\. On the first day of the latter half (of the month he eats) fourteen
mouthfuls.

20\. Thus (he takes every day) one (mouthful) less up to the day of the
new moon.

21\. On the day of the new moon there is not (even) one mouthful (left
to take).

22\. On the first day of the first half (of the month) one (mouthful may
be eaten), on the second two.

23\. Thus he daily increases (his meal) by one (mouthful) up to the day
of the full moon.

24\. On the day of the full moon he offers a Sthâlîpâka  to Agni, to the
lunar day whichever it may be, and to the lunar mansions as well as to
their (guardian) deities.

25\. Having offered a burnt oblation to (the lunar mansion) Abhi*g*it
(which stands) before *S*ro*n*â, and to its (guardian) deity, he must
give a cow to the Brâhma*n*as.

26\. That is the ant-shaped lunar penance; (that which is performed in
the) inverted (order is called) the barleycorn-shaped (lunar
penance). <span id="fr_1385"></span>[26](#fn_1385.md)

27\. A sinner who has performed either of these two (penances) becomes
free from all mortal sins (pâtaka).

28\. They declare that the (*K*ândrâya*n*a) shall be performed for the
sake of the fulfilment of wishes of all kinds.

29\. 'Thereby man obtains every wish which he may conceive.'

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

30\. 'Thereby the sages formerly purified themselves and accomplished
their objects. That (rite) procures wealth, spiritual merit, sons,
cattle, long life, heavenly bliss, and fame; it secures the fulfilment
of all desires.'

31\. 'He who studies this, becomes the companion of the lunar
constellations, of sun and moon, and dwells in their world.'

chapter compare Gautama XXVII.

<span id="fn_1375"></span>[303:4](sbe1480.htm#fr_1375.md) The meaning of
the Sûtra is that the fire which has been carried into the âvasatha must
be kept burning during the whole month which the *K*ândrâya*n*a lasts.
For a burnt oblation has to be performed at the end of the penance.
Should it be extinguished, it must be rekindled by friction.
