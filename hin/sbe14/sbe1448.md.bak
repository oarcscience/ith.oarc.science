### Footnotes

<span id="fn_960"></span>[192:1](sbe1448.htm#fr_960.md) **15**. Mânava
*S*rauta Sûtra I, 1, 1, and Kumârila thereon in Professor Goldstücker's
lithographed copy and Kâtyâyana *S*rauta Sûtra I, 8, 24. See also
Professor Haug's map of 'the sacrificial compound,' Aitareya-brâhma*n*a,
vol. i.

<span id="fn_961"></span>[192:3](sbe1448.htm#fr_961.md) I.e. the entrance
and exit are to be made to the south of the fires.

<span id="fn_962"></span>[193:5](sbe1448.htm#fr_962.md) Govinda explains
si*k*, 'the hem of the garment,' by the garment wrapped round the loins
(parihita*m* vâsa*h*).

<span id="fn_963"></span>[193:7](sbe1448.htm#fr_963.md) The meaning is that
the priest must hold the sacrificial implements, such as the sru*k* and
sruva ladles, between himself and the fires, and not place himself
between them and the fires (âtmano bahir na kûryât agner antara*h*
svaya*m* na bhaved iti yâvat).

<span id="fn_964"></span>[193:8](sbe1448.htm#fr_964.md) 'He gives the
reason for that (rule), "For the sacrificial implements (are) nearer"
than the priests, that must be understood.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_965"></span>[193:10](sbe1448.htm#fr_965.md) 'For they obtain
the reward of the sacrifice. The instances (referring) to those two are
the Vaisar*g*anas and the Dâkshi*n*as:--Govinda.

<span id="fn_966"></span>[193:11](sbe1448.htm#fr_966.md) Kâtyâyana *S*rauta
Sûtra I, 8, 31. 'If the space on the <span id="page_184">p. 184</span>
Uttaravedi and the rest is confined, the Soma is made ready immediately
after the fire, after that the meat and so forth, after that the grain
for the sacrificial cakes, then the clarified butter, and after that the
spoons called sruva, sru*k*, and so forth.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_967"></span>[194:12](sbe1448.htm#fr_967.md) 'It is indicated
hereby that, if there is work (to be done) there, they shall not turn
away from the sacred fires except ir cases of absolute
necessity.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_968"></span>[194:13](sbe1448.htm#fr_968.md) 'This rule (refers
to the case) when he walks with the sacred fires. It must be understood
that he shall not turn his back on the fires.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[194:14](sbe1448.htm#fr_969.md) 'This rule (is to
be interpreted) in the same manner (as the preceding one). Or it is
prescribed by these two Sûtras that the men engaged (in the sacrifice)
shall go out, turning their right hand towards (the fires).'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_970"></span>[194:15](sbe1448.htm#fr_970.md) Kâtyâyana *S*rauta
Sûtra V, 1, 11.

<span id="fn_971"></span>[194:16](sbe1448.htm#fr_971.md) I read with the
MSS. of the text '*k*âtvâlâd âhavanîyotkarau.' The two copies of the
commentary give *k*âtvâlah âhavanîyotkarau. Govinda says that the words
antare*n*a tîrtham must be understood. For the position of the *K*âtvâla
and the Utkara, see Professor Haug's map, where the road of the priests
is also marked, though somewhat differently.

<span id="fn_972"></span>[195:23](sbe1448.htm#fr_972.md) For the seats of
the priests and the other persons named in this and the following rules,
see Professor Haug's plan, and Dr. Hillebrandt's Altindische Neu and
Vollmondopfer, p. 190.

<span id="fn_973"></span>[195:24](sbe1448.htm#fr_973.md) 'The northern
Sro*n*i of the Vedi, i.e. the north-western corner of the
Vedi.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_974"></span>[195:31](sbe1448.htm#fr_974.md) Taittirîya
Sa*m*hitâ III, I, 1, 2, where the rule also is given. M. alone adds
another Sûtra, the text of which is corrupt. But it ended with the
mantra undatîr bala*m* dhatta, &c. Taitt. S. ibid. 3.
