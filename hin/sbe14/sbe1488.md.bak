### PRA*S*NA IV, ADHYÂYA 6.

1\. The (eleven Anuvâkas called) Rudras together with (the ten hymns)
seen by Madhu*kkh*andas, the Gâyatrî with the syllable Om, and likewise
the seven Vyâh*ri*tis (are the texts) which should be muttered (and)
which remove guilt. <span id="fr_1455"></span>[1](#fn_1455.md)

2\. The M*ri*gâresh*t*i, the Pavitresh*t*i, the Trihavis, the Pâvamânî
are the Ish*t*is which efface sin, if they are (each) combined with the
Vai*s*vânara (Dvâda*s*akapâla). <span id="fr_1456"></span>[2](#fn_1456.md)

3-4. Learn, also, the following most excellent secret; he will be freed
from all sins of all kinds who sprinkles himself with water, reciting
the Pavitras, who mutters the eleven (Anuvâkas called) Rudras, who
offers burnt oblations of butter, reciting the Pavitras, and gives gold,
a cow, and sesamum (to Brâhma*n*as).

5\. He who partakes of boiled barley-gruel, mixed with cow's urine,
liquid cowdung, sour milk, milk, and butter, is quickly freed from
sin. <span id="fr_1457"></span>[5](#fn_1457.md)

6\. Both he who has begotten a child on a *S*ûdra woman and he who has
had connexion with a female, <span id="fr_1458"></span>[6](#fn_1458.md)

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

intercourse with whom is forbidden (agamyâ), are purified (if they live)
according to this rule during seven days.

7\. (That is likewise) the remedy when one has swallowed semen, ordure,
and urine, or eaten the food of persons whose food must not be eaten,
(and also) when a younger brother has kindled the sacred fire, has
offered a *S*rauta sacrifice, or taken a wife before the elder. <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[7](#fn_1459.md)

8\. He who has committed even a great number of (wicked) actions,
excepting mortal sins, will be freed (by that rule) from all guilt. That
is the statement of the virtuous.

9\. But (this) ordinance, which is based on the authority of the sacred
texts, is stated (to be that) through which Bharadvâ*g*a and others
became equal to Brahman,

10\. Through the performance of these rites a Brâhma*n*a, whose heart is
full of peace, obtains whatever desires he may have in his heart.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1455"></span>[328:1](sbe1488.htm#fr_1455.md) **6**. The hymns
are Rig-veda I, 1-10.

<span id="fn_1456"></span>[328:2](sbe1488.htm#fr_1456.md) Regarding the
M*ri*gâresh*t*i, see Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ IV, 7, 15. In explanation of the
term Trihavis, Govinda adds the word Savanesh*t*i.

<span id="fn_1457"></span>[328:5](sbe1488.htm#fr_1457.md) Yâvaka,
translated, as usually, by barley-gruel, can also denote, as Govinda
points out, other dishes made of barley.

<span id="fn_1458"></span>[328:6](sbe1488.htm#fr_1458.md) See above, II, 1,
2, 7, 10, 13-14.

<span id="fn_1459"></span>[329:7](sbe1488.htm#fr_1459.md) See above, II, 2,
1, 21, 39-40. I follow the reading of M. and of the commentary,
paryâdhâne*g*yayor etat parivitte *k*a bhesha*g*am. The reading of the
Dekhan MSS. is etat patite *k*aiva bho*g*anam, 'that food must be eaten 
and when one has become an outcast.'
