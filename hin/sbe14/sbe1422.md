### CHAPTER XIX.

1\. The particular duty of a king is to protect (all) beings; by
fulfilling it (he obtains) success (in this world and in the
next). <span id="fr_551"></span>[1](#fn_551)

2\. Those learned (in the sacred law) declare that to be free from fear
and pity is, indeed, a life-long sacrificial session (sattra, to be
performed by the king). <span id="fr_552"></span>[2](#fn_552)

3\. Therefore let him appoint a domestic priest to (perform the rites)
obligatory on the order of householders. <span
id="fr_553"></span>[3](#fn_553)

4\. It is declared in the Veda, 'A realm where a Brâhma*n*a is appointed
domestic priest, prospers;' <span id="fr_554"></span>[4](#fn_554)

5\. For thus both (the special duties of a king and those of a
householder) will be fulfilled,

6\. And (the king alone is) unable (to do both).

7\. Let the king, paying attention to all the laws of countries,
(subdivisions of) castes (*g*âti) and families, make the four castes
(var*n*a) fulfil their (respective) particular duties. <span
id="fr_555"></span>[7](#fn_555)

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

8\. Let him punish those who stray from (the path of duty). <span
id="fr_556"></span>[8](#fn_556)

9\. But punishment must be awarded in cases of assault and abuse after
(due consideration of) the particular place and time (where and when the
offence was committed), of the duties, age, learning (of the parties),
and the seat (of the injury), <span id="fr_557"></span>[9](#fn_557)

10\. In accordance with (the precepts of) the (sacred) records and with
precedents.

11\. Let him not injure trees that bear fruit or flowers. <span
id="fr_558"></span>[11](#fn_558)

12\. (But) he may injure them in order to extend cultivation and (for
sacrifices). <span id="fr_559"></span>[12](#fn_559)

13\. The measures and weights of objects necessary for households must
be guarded (against falsification). <span
id="fr_560"></span>[13](#fn_560)

14\. Let him not take property for his own use from (the inhabitants of)
his realm. <span id="fr_561"></span>[14](#fn_561)

15\. The measures and price (of such property) only shall be liable to
deductions (in the shape of taxes).

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

16\. .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     . <span
id="fr_562"></span>[16](#fn_562)

17\. On the march against the enemy the army which consists of companies
of ten, shall be able to perform a double (duty). <span
id="fr_563"></span>[17](#fn_563)

18\. In every (camp) there shall be places where water is distributed.

19\. Let him make one hundred men at the least engage in battle.

20\. The wives (of slain soldiers) shall be provided for.

21\. .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     . <span
id="fr_564"></span>[21](#fn_564)

22\. A ferry shall be taken away (from a river) in which there is no
water. <span id="fr_565"></span>[22](#fn_565)

23\. A *S*rotriya is free from taxes, (and so are) a servant of the
king, one who has no protector, <span id="fr_566"></span>[23](#fn_566)

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

one who has left (the order of householders), an infant, a very aged
man, a young man (who studies), and pradâtâs;

24\. (Moreover widows) who return to their former (family), unmarried
maidens, and the wives of servants, <span
id="fr_567"></span>[24](#fn_567)

25\. He who swims with his arms (across a river in order to escape
payment of a toll at a ferry) shall pay one hundred times (the amount
due). <span id="fr_568"></span>[25](#fn_568)

26\. No taxes (shall be paid) on the usufruct of rivers, dry grass,
forests, (places of) combustion, and mountains; <span
id="fr_569"></span>[26](#fn_569)

27\. Or those who draw their subsistence from them may pay (something),

28\. But he shall take a monthly tax from artisans. <span
id="fr_570"></span>[28](#fn_570)

29\. And when a king has died, let him give what is required for the
occasion. <span id="fr_571"></span>[29](#fn_571)

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

30\. It is hereby explained that (his) mother (must receive)
maintenance.

31\. Let the king maintain the paternal and maternal uncles of the
chief-queen,

32\. As well as her other relatives.

33\. The wives of the (deceased) king shall receive food and raiment,

34\. Or if they are unwilling, they may depart. <span
id="fr_572"></span>[34](#fn_572)

35\. Let the king maintain eunuchs and madmen, <span
id="fr_573"></span>[35](#fn_573)

36\. Since their property goes to him.

37\. Now they quote also a verse proclaimed by Manu, which refers to
duties and. taxes, 'No duty (is paid) on a sum less than a Karshâpa*n*a,
there is no tax on a livelihood gained by art, nor on an infant, nor on
a messenger, nor on what has been received as alms, nor on the remnants
of property left after a robbery, nor on a *S*rotriya, nor on an
ascetic, nor on a sacrifice.' <span id="fr_574"></span>[37](#fn_574)

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

38\. A thief becomes free from guilt by entering (the royal presence)
after (his deed and asking to be punished). <span
id="fr_575"></span>[38](#fn_575)

39\. But according to some (lawyers) he (who is caught) with weapons in
his hands, with stolen goods in his possession, or covered with wounds
is proved (to be a criminal). <span id="fr_576"></span>[39](#fn_576)

40\. In case (a criminal) worthy of punishment is allowed to go free,
the king shall fast during one (day and one) night;

41\. (And) his domestic priest during three (days and) nights.

42\. If an innocent man is punished, the domestic priest (shall perform)
a K*rikkh*ra penance;

43\. (And) the king (shall fast) during three (days and) nights.

44\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'The slayer of a
learned Brâhma*n*a casts his guilt on him who eats his food; an
adulterous wife on her (negligent) husband; a student and a sacrificer
on an (ignorant) teacher (and officiating priest); and a thief on the
king (who pardons him).' <span id="fr_577"></span>[44](#fn_577)

45\. 'But men who have committed offences and have received from kings
the punishment (due to them), go pure to heaven, and (become) as holy as
the virtuous.' <span id="fr_578"></span>[45](#fn_578)

46\. 'The guilt falls on the king who pardons an

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

offender. If he causes him to be slain, he destroys sin in accordance
with the sacred law.'

47\. 'It is ordained that kings become at once pure (by bathing) when
they have done acts causing death. They are likewise (pure while engaged
in business) not causing death. Time is the reason for that.' <span
id="fr_579"></span>[47](#fn_579)

48\. And with reference to this (matter) they quote a verse proclaimed
by Yama, 'No taint of impurity, forsooth, falls on kings, on those
engaged . in practising vows, or on those engaged in the performance of
sacrificial session (sattra); for (the first) are seated on the throne
of Indra, (and the others) are always equal to Brahman.' <span
id="fr_580"></span>[48](#fn_580)

<span id="fn_557"></span>[97:9](sbe1422.htm#fr_557) Gautama XII, 51.
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita has two Sûtras instead of one, and reads the second
hi*m*sâkro*s*ayo*h* kalpa*h*. The majority of the MSS. have, however,
kalpâ(*h*), which I consider to be a mistake for kalpya*h*, 'must be
awarded.'

<span id="fn_558"></span>[97:11](sbe1422.htm#fr_558) Vish*n*u V, 55-56.
The meaning of the Sûtra is that the king is to punish those who commit
such acts.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[97:12](sbe1422.htm#fr_559) The explicit
permission to cut down trees for sacrificial purposes is given Vish*n*u
LI, 63.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[97:13](sbe1422.htm#fr_560) Manu VIII, 403.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[97:14](sbe1422.htm#fr_561)-15. The translation
of these two Sutras is not certain, because the words nîhâra and
naihârika are not found elsewhere in the sense which has been attributed
to them here. Still I think it very probable that K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita's
explanation nirhâra and nirhâre sâdhu is right, and that the king is
exhorted not to take the property of his subjects by force, but to levy
taxes according to the value or the measure of the articles sold.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[98:16](sbe1422.htm#fr_562) The Sûtra has been
left out, as the text is corrupt, and I am unable to suggest any
emendation. K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita's explanation is not worth giving.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[98:17](sbe1422.htm#fr_563) 'The army which
consists of companies of ten,' i.e. the lowest subdivision of which
consists of ten parts, viz. one elephant, one chariot, two horsemen, and
three foot soldiers. Such a body is called a patti. The larger
divisions, like the senâmukha, 'battalion,' &c., are formed by three,
nine, or twenty-seven pattis. Though I am unable to adduce any positive
proof for it, vâha must, according to the connexion in which it stands,
be a synonym of patti. 'The double duty' of the army is, according to
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita, marching and fighting.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[98:21](sbe1422.htm#fr_564) The Sûtra is
utterly corrupt, and cannot be restored with the help of the MSS. at my
disposal. It probably referred to the amount of duties to be levied on
goods sold in the market.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[98:22](sbe1422.htm#fr_565) The meaning of the
Sûtra seems to be, that on those rivers, where the water either runs off
or is very low during the dry season, the ferrymen must not be allowed
to exact a toll from people crossing without their help. Such a rule
would not be superfluous, as most Indian rivers are perfectly fordable
between December and June, but impassable without boats in the other
five months.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[98:23](sbe1422.htm#fr_566) Âpastamba II, 10,
26, 10, 12-17; Manu VIII, 394. K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita to correctly points
out that, though according to I, 43, all Brâhma*n*as are to be free from
taxes, the *S*rotriya or Vaidik is mentioned once more in order to show
that a king, however distressed, must not take anything from him (Manu
VII, 133). K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita reads instead of pradâtâs, pradâtâra*h*,
'very liberal men.' Manu loc. cit. exempts 'those who confer great
benefits on priests of eminent learning' from paying taxes. His
emendation would, therefore, be acceptable if the word pradâtâ*h* did
not occur in the same connexion above, XI, 7.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[99:24](sbe1422.htm#fr_567) Âpastamba II, 10,
26, 11.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[99:25](sbe1422.htm#fr_568) I read with the
majority of the MSS. bâhubhyâmuttara*ñkh*ataguna*m* dadyât.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[99:26](sbe1422.htm#fr_569)
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita explains dâha, '(places of) combustion,' by agni,
'fire.' I am not certain what he means thereby. To me it seems most
probable that Vasish*th*a intends 'a place of cremation' (dâhasthala),
though it is just possible to refer the expression to the jungle fires,
which the aboriginal tribes light in the forests, in order to sow their
Nâglî in the ground manured by the ashes.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[99:28](sbe1422.htm#fr_570) Gautama, X, 31.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[99:29](sbe1422.htm#fr_571)
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita refers this and the following five Sûtras to <span
id="page_100">p. 100</span> the case where a king has conquered a
foreign country; compare also Vish*n*u III, 49-48. I think that Sûtras
30-31 conclusively show that these rules are intended to regulate the
conduct of a king on the death of his predecessor and his own accession
to the throne.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[100:34](sbe1422.htm#fr_572)
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita thinks that the queens unwilling to accept a bare
subsistence may go wherever they like. I think the word used in the text
points rather to their becoming ascetics.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[100:35](sbe1422.htm#fr_573) This rule refers
apparently to eunuchs and insane persons left with money, but without
near relatives, with whom they are united in interest. Vish*n*u III, 65.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[100:37](sbe1422.htm#fr_574) I translate the
one word *s*ulka by 'duties and taxes.' The term has a great many
different meanings in the law books, and is in this verse apparently
used in two senses. K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita is of a different opinion, and
thinks that the persons named are free from paying a *s*ulka in case
they trade. The chief objection is that trading ascetics and *S*rotriyas
are not known to the ancient writers, though they are common enough in
modern India.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[101:38](sbe1422.htm#fr_575) This Sûtra
apparently alludes to a penitent thief who con-fesses his crime and asks
for punishment; see below, XX, 41.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[101:39](sbe1422.htm#fr_576) Manu IX, 270;
Nârada V, 29-33 (Jolly). As given in the MSS. and by
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita, the Sûtra is doubtlessly corrupt. I read
vra*n*asampanno vyapadish*t*a*h*.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[101:44](sbe1422.htm#fr_577) Identical with
Manu VIII, 317.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[101:45](sbe1422.htm#fr_578) Identical with
Manu VIII, 318.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[102:47](sbe1422.htm#fr_579) Vish*n*u XXII, 48;
Manu V, 94.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[102:48](sbe1422.htm#fr_580) Identical with
Manu V, 93. 'Those engaged in practising vows' are, according to Kullûka
and K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita, students learning the Veda.
