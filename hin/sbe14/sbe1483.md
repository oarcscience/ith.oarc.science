### PRA*S*NA IV, ADHYÂYA 1.

1\. We will separately explain the various penances for the several
offences, both heavier and lighter ones.

2\. Let him prescribe whatever may be befitting for each
(case),--heavier (penances) for great (crimes) and easier ones for
trivial (faults).

3\. Let him perform the penances according to the rule given in the
Institutes (of the Sacred Law in cases) where an offence has been
committed with the organ or with the feet (and) the arms, through <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[3](#fn_1399.md)

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

thoughts or speech, through the ear, the skin, the nose or the eye.

4\. Or, in (the case of) transgressions committed through the organ of
vision, of hearing, of sensation, of smelling, and through thoughts, he
also becomes pure by three suppressions of the breath.

5\. In case (he commits the offences) of eating the food of a *S*ûdra or
of cohabiting with a *S*ûdra female, severally, he must perform, during
seven days, seven suppressions of the breath on each day. <span
id="fr_1400"></span>[5](#fn_1400.md)

6\. For partaking of food unfit for eating or drinking, and for selling
forbidden merchandise, excepting honey, meat, clarified butter, oil,
pungent condiments and bad food, and for similar (offences), he must
perform, during twelve days, twelve suppressions of the breath on each
day. <span id="fr_1401"></span>[6](#fn_1401.md)

7\. For other transgressions excepting mortal sins (pâtaka), crimes
causing loss of caste (patanîya), and the minor faults (called
upapâtaka), he must perform, during half a month, twelve suppressions of
the breath on each day. <span id="fr_1402"></span>[7](#fn_1402.md)

8\. For other transgressions excepting mortal sins <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[8](#fn_1403.md)

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

and crimes causing loss of caste, he must perform, during twelve periods
of twelve days, twelve suppressions of the breath on each day.

9\. For other transgressions excepting mortal sins he must perform,
during twelve half-months, twelve suppressions of the breath on each
day. <span id="fr_1404"></span>[9](#fn_1404.md)

10\. But for mortal sins he must perform, during a year, twelve
suppressions of the breath on each day.

11\. Let him give his daughter, while she still goes naked, to a man who
has not broken the vow of chastity and who possesses good qualities, or
even to one destitute of good qualities; let him not keep (the maiden)
in (his house) after she has reached the age of puberty. <span
id="fr_1405"></span>[11](#fn_1405.md)

12\. He who does not give away a marriageable daughter during three
years doubtlessly contracts a guilt equal to (that of) destroying an
embryo.

13\. Such will be the case if anybody asks her in marriage, and also if
nobody demands her. Manu has declared that at each appearance of the
menses (the father incurs the guilt of) a mortal sin.

14\. Three years let a marriageable damsel wait for the order of her
father. But after (that) time let her choose for herself in the fourth
year a husband (of) equal (rank). If no man (of) equal (rank) be found,
she may take even one destitute of good qualities.

15\. If a damsel has been abducted by force, and has not been wedded
with sacred texts, she may lawfully be given to another man; she is even
like a maiden. <span id="fr_1406"></span>[15](#fn_1406.md)

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

16\. If, after (a damsel) has been given away, or even after (the
nuptial sacrifices) have been offered, the husband dies, she who (thus)
has left (her father's house) and has returned, may be again wedded
according to the rule applicable to second weddings, provided the
marriage had not been consummated. <span
id="fr_1407"></span>[16](#fn_1407.md)

17\. He who does not approach, during three years, a wife who is
marriageable, incurs, without doubt, a guilt equal to that of destroying
an embryo.

18\. But the ancestors of that man who does not approach his wife who
bathed after her temporary uncleanness, though he dwells near her, lie
during that month in the menstrual excretions (of the wife).

19\. They declare that the guilt of the husband who does not approach
his wife in due season, of him who approaches her during her temporary
uncleanness, and of him who commits an unnatural crime (with her), is
equally (great).

20\. Let him proclaim in the village a wife who, being obdurate against
her husband, makes herself sterile, as one who destroys embryos, and
drive her from his house.

21\. But for the transgression of that husband who does not approach a
wife who bathed after temporary uncleanness, (the performance of) one
hundred suppressions of the breath is prescribed (as a penance). <span
id="fr_1408"></span>[21](#fn_1408.md)

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

22\. Seated with Ku*s*a grass in his hands, let him repeatedly suppress
his breath, and again and again recite purificatory texts, the
Vyâh*ri*tis, the syllable Om, and the daily portion of the Veda. <span
id="fr_1409"></span>[22](#fn_1409.md)

23\. Always intent on the practice of Yoga, let him again and again
suppress his breath. (Thus) he performs the highest austerity up to the
ends of his hair and up to the ends of his nails.

24\. Through the obstruction (of the respiration) air is generated,
through air fire is produced, then through heat water is formed; hence
he is internally purified by (those) three.

25\. Through the practice of Yoga (true) knowledge is obtained, Yoga is
the sum of the sacred law, all good qualities are gained through Yoga;
therefore let him always be absorbed in the practice of Yoga. <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[25](#fn_1410.md)

26\. The Vedas likewise begin with the syllable Om, and they end with
the syllable Om. The syllable Om and the Vyâh*ri*tis are the eternal,
everlasting Brahman. <span id="fr_1411"></span>[26](#fn_1411.md)

27\. For him who is constantly engaged in (reciting) the syllable Om,
the seven Vyâh*ri*tis, and the three-footed Gâyatrî, no danger exists
anywhere. <span id="fr_1412"></span>[27](#fn_1412.md)

28\. If, restraining his breath, he thrice recites the Gâyatrî together
with the syllable Om and with the (text called) *S*iras, that is called
one suppression of breath. <span id="fr_1413"></span>[28](#fn_1413.md)

29\. But sixteen suppressions of breath, accompanied <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[29](#fn_1414.md)

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

by (the recitation of) the Vyâh*ri*tis and of the syllable Om, repeated
daily, purify after a month even the slayer of a learned Brâhma*n*a.

30\. That is the highest austerity, that is the best description of the
sacred law. That, indeed, is the best means of removing all sin.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1399"></span>[312:3](sbe1483.htm#fr_1399.md) The construction
is certainly elliptical. I understand tatra with the first half-verse.
Govinda separates the two half-verses, yad upasthak*ri*tam papa*m*, &c.,
from the first, and reads at the end <span id="page_313">p. 313</span>
of the half-verse prâ*n*âyâmân samâ*k*aret, 'one should perform
suppressions of the breath (in even or equal numbers).'

<span id="fn_1400"></span>[313:5](sbe1483.htm#fr_1400.md) Govinda tries to
reconcile this rule with the one given above, I, I, 2, 7, by assuming
that the word *S*ûdra denotes here a Brâhma*n*a who lives like a *S*ûdra
and neglects his sacred duties.

<span id="fn_1401"></span>[313:6](sbe1483.htm#fr_1401.md) I read,
conjecturally, dvâda*s*âham, 'twelve days.' The MSS. of the text have
dvâda*s*a dvâda*s*âham, or corruptions pointing to this reading, and C.
I. reads ardhamâsam. Regarding avarânna, 'bad food,' see note on
Âpastamba II, 6, 15, 16.

<span id="fn_1402"></span>[313:7](sbe1483.htm#fr_1402.md) I read,
conjecturally, ardhamâsa*m*, 'half a month;' D. has ardhamâsân; K.
dvâda*s*âha*m*; M. dvâda*s*ârdhamâsam; C. I. dvâda*s*ârdhamâsân, which
is explained by sha*n*mâsân.

<span id="fn_1403"></span>[313:8](sbe1483.htm#fr_1403.md) I read with M.
dvâda*s*a dvâda*s*âhân. D. K. have dvâda*s*âham. The commentary omits
the Sûtra altogether.

<span id="fn_1404"></span>[314:9](sbe1483.htm#fr_1404.md) I read with D.,
K., and M., dvâda*s*ârdhamâsân. The commentary omits also this Sûtra.

<span id="fn_1405"></span>[314:11](sbe1483.htm#fr_1405.md) Vasish*th*a
XVII, 67-71, and above.

<span id="fn_1406"></span>[314:15](sbe1483.htm#fr_1406.md) Vasish*th*a
XVII, 73.

<span id="fn_1407"></span>[315:16](sbe1483.htm#fr_1407.md) Vasish*th*a
XVII, 74.

<span id="fn_1408"></span>[315:21](sbe1483.htm#fr_1408.md) The MSS. of the
text read, *ri*tusnâtâ*m* to yo bhâryâ*m* niyatâ*m* brahma*k*âri*n*îm \|
niyamâtikrame tasya prâ*n*âyâma*s*ata*m* sm*ri*tam. The commentary omits
the first half of the verse altogether. The latter, as read in the MSS.,
gives no sense. It seems to me that <span id="page_316">p. 316</span>
either its end must have been sa*m*nidhau nopaga*kkh*ati (as in Sûtra
17), or that a whole half-verse has been lost.

<span id="fn_1409"></span>[316:22](sbe1483.htm#fr_1409.md)-24. Vasish*th*a
XXV, 4-6.

<span id="fn_1410"></span>[316:25](sbe1483.htm#fr_1410.md) Vasish*th*a XXV,
8.

<span id="fn_1411"></span>[316:26](sbe1483.htm#fr_1411.md) Vasish*th*a XXV,
10.

<span id="fn_1412"></span>[316:27](sbe1483.htm#fr_1412.md) Vasish*th*a XXV,
9.

<span id="fn_1413"></span>[316:28](sbe1483.htm#fr_1413.md) Vasish*th*a XXV,
13.

<span id="fn_1414"></span>[316:29](sbe1483.htm#fr_1414.md) Vasish*th*a
XXVI, 4.
