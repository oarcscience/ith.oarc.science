# BAUDHÂYANA.

### PRA*S*NA I, ADHYÂYA 1, KA*ND*IKÂ 1.

1\. The sacred law is taught in each Veda. <span
id="fr_729"></span>[1](#fn_729.md)

2\. We will explain (it) in accordance with that.

3\. (The sacred law), taught in the Tradition (Sm*ri*ti, stands)
second. <span id="fr_730"></span>[3](#fn_730.md)

4\. The practice of the *S*ish*t*as (stands) third. <span
id="fr_731"></span>[4](#fn_731.md)

5\. *S*ish*t*as, forsooth, (are those) who are free from envy, free from
pride, contented with a store of grain sufficient for ten days, free
from covetousness, and free from hypocrisy, arrogance, greed,
perplexity, and anger. <span id="fr_732"></span>[5](#fn_732.md)

6\. '(Those are called) *S*ish*t*as who, in accordance with the sacred
law, have studied the Veda together <span
id="fr_733"></span>[6](#fn_733.md)

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

with its appendages, know how to draw inferences from that, (and) are
able to adduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed
texts.'

7\. On failure of them, an assembly consisting at least of ten members
(shall decide disputed points of law).

8\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Four men, who each know
one of the four Vedas, a Mîmâ*m*saka, one who knows the Aṅgas, one who
recites (the works on) the sacred law, and three Brâhma*n*as belonging
to (three different) orders, (constitute) an assembly consisting, at
least, of ten members.' <span id="fr_734"></span>[8](#fn_734.md)

9\. 'There may be five, or there may be three, or there may be one
blameless man, who decides (questions regarding) the sacred law. But a
thousand fools (can)not (do it).' <span id="fr_735"></span>[9](#fn_735.md)

10\. 'As an elephant made of wood, as an antelope made of leather, such
is an unlearned Brâhma*n*a: those three having nothing but the name (of
their kind).' <span id="fr_736"></span>[10](#fn_736.md)

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

11\. 'That sin which dunces, perplexed by ignorance and unacquainted
with the sacred law, declare (to be duty), falls, increased a
hundredfold, on those who propound it.' <span
id="fr_737"></span>[11](#fn_737.md)

12\. 'Narrow and difficult to find is the path of the sacred law,
towards which many gates lead. Hence, if there is a doubt, it must not
be propounded by one man (only), however learned he may be.' <span
id="fr_738"></span>[12](#fn_738.md)

13\. 'What Brâhma*n*as, riding in the chariot of the law (and) wielding
the sword of the Veda, propound even in jest, that is declared to be the
highest law.'

14\. 'As wind and sun will make water, collected on a stone, disappear,
even so the sin that (cleaves) to an offender completely vanishes like
water.' <span id="fr_739"></span>[14](#fn_739.md)

15\. 'He who knows the sacred law shall fix the penances with
discernment, taking into consideration the constitution, the strength,
the knowledge, and the age (of the offender), as well as the time and
the deed.' <span id="fr_740"></span>[15](#fn_740.md)

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

16\. Many thousands (of Brâhma*n*as) cannot form a (legal) assembly (for
declaring the sacred law), if they have not fulfilled their sacred
duties, are unacquainted with the Veda, and subsist only by the name of
their caste.' <span id="fr_741"></span>[16](#fn_741.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_729"></span>[143:1](sbe1434.htm#fr_729.md) **I**. Vasish*th*a
I, 4. Each Veda, i.e. each *s*âkhâ or redaction of the Veda.--Govinda.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[143:3](sbe1434.htm#fr_730.md) Vasish*th*a I, 4.
Govinda takes sm*ri*ti, 'the tradition,' in the sense of works (grantha)
explaining the recollections of the *Ri*shis, and is no doubt right in
doing so.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[143:4](sbe1434.htm#fr_731.md) Vasish*th*a I, 5.
The explanation of âgama by 'practice' rests on the authority of Govinda
and the parallel passages where *s*îla and â*k*âra, 'conduct,' are used.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[143:5](sbe1434.htm#fr_732.md) Âpastamba I, 7, 20,
8; Gautama XXVIII, 48. Kumbhidhânya, translated according to Govinda by
'contented with a store of grain sufficient for ten days,' means,
according to others, 'contented with a store of grain sufficient for six
days or for a year.'

<span id="fn_733"></span>[143:6](sbe1434.htm#fr_733.md) Vasish*th*a VI, 43.
Govinda omits the word 'iti,' given by the <span id="page_144">p.
144</span> MSS. after the verse, whereby it is marked as a quotation.
'The appendages,' i.e. the Itihâsas and Purâ*n*as.--Govinda.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[144:8](sbe1434.htm#fr_734.md) Vasish*th*a III,
20. Govinda, quoting Gautama XXVIII, 49, says that Vânaprasthas cannot
serve as members of Parishads, because they live in the forest. He also
notices a different reading, not found in my MSS. 'Â*s*ramasthâs trayo
mukhyâ*h*.' He asserts that thereby professed students are intended,
because professed students are declared to be particularly holy in the
Dharmaskandha-brâhmana.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[144:9](sbe1434.htm#fr_735.md) Vasish*th*a III, 7.
Itare, translated by 'fools,' means literally, those different from the
persons enumerated in the preceding verse.' Govinda remarks that
according to Sûtra 12 one learned Brâhma*n*a must be taken only in cases
of the most pressing necessity.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[144:10](sbe1434.htm#fr_736.md) Vasish*th*a III,
11.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[145:11](sbe1434.htm#fr_737.md) Vasish*th*a III,
6.

<span id="fn_738"></span>[145:12](sbe1434.htm#fr_738.md) The 'gates' of the
sacred law are the Vedas, the Sm*ri*tis, and the practice of the
Sish*t*as. They are many, because the redactions of the Vedas and
Sm*ri*tis are numerous and the practices vary in different countries.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[145:14](sbe1434.htm#fr_739.md) I.e. provided the
offender performs the penance imposed by learned and virtuous
Brâhma*n*as. Pra*n*â*s*ayet, 'will make disappear,' is ungrammatical, as
the subject stands in the dual. Grammatical accuracy has probably been
sacrificed to the exigencies of the metre.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[145:15](sbe1434.htm#fr_740.md) Vasish*th*a XIX,
9. *S*arîram, literally 'the body,' means here the constitution, which
may be bilious, 'windy,' and so forth. Âyu*h*, literally 'life' or 'long
life,' has been translated by 'knowledge,' in accordance with Govinda's
explanation *gñ*ânam. As the word vaya*h*, 'age,' also occurs in this
verse, it is clear that âyu*h* cannot have its usual meaning.

<span id="fn_741"></span>[146:16](sbe1434.htm#fr_741.md) Vasish*th*a III,
5. The two copies of the commentary omit this Sûtra, though it is quoted
in the explanation of Sûtra 9. The best MSS. repeat the last words of
the Sûtra in order to show that the Ka*nd*ikâ ends here. The same
practice is observed, though not quite regularly, in the sequel.
