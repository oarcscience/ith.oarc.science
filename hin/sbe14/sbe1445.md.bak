### Footnotes

<span id="fn_919"></span>[184:1](sbe1445.htm#fr_919.md) **12**. Vasish*th*a
XIV, 40.

<span id="fn_920"></span>[184:2](sbe1445.htm#fr_920.md) Vasish*th*a XIV,
48. Govinda says that the particle *k*a, 'and,' is used in order to
indicate that the word 'tame' must be understood.

<span id="fn_921"></span>[184:3](sbe1445.htm#fr_921.md) Âpastamba I, 5, 17,
29, 32.

<span id="fn_922"></span>[184:5](sbe1445.htm#fr_922.md) Vasish*th*a XIV,
39. Another explanation of the word *s*vâvi*t*, 'the porcupine' (see
also Gautama XVII, 27), is given in the commentary, which says that it
is a wild animal resembling a dog, and belonging to the boar species.
Govinda points out that there is a dispute among the learned regarding
the rhinoceros (Vasish*th*a XV, 47), and that the peculiar wording of
the Sûtra is intended to indicate that.

<span id="fn_923"></span>[184:6](sbe1445.htm#fr_923.md) The permissibility
of the last-named animal is again doubtful.

<span id="fn_924"></span>[184:7](sbe1445.htm#fr_924.md) Gautama XVII, 35.
The case of the last-mentioned bird, the Vâra*n*a, is again doubtful.
From the first rock-edict of A*s*oka <span id="page_185">p. 185</span>
it appears that peacocks, now considered inviolable, were actually eaten
in the third century A. D.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[185:8](sbe1445.htm#fr_925.md) Vasish*th*a XIV,
41-42. The names are much corrupted in the MSS., and for Ma*s*akari,
which I do not find in the dictionaries, Sama*s*akari or Samasakari is
also read. The B*ri*ha*kkh*iras is probably the Indian salmon, the
Mâhsir.

<span id="fn_926"></span>[185:9](sbe1445.htm#fr_926.md)-10. Vasish*th*a
XIV, 34-35 Gautama XVII, 22. The meaning of sandhinî, 'a female animal
that gives milk while big with young,' is uncertain. See also Vish*n*u
LI, 40 Âpastamba I, 5, 17, 23.

<span id="fn_927"></span>[185:11](sbe1445.htm#fr_927.md) Gautama XVII, 24.

<span id="fn_928"></span>[185:12](sbe1445.htm#fr_928.md) Vish*n*u LI,
38-41.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[185:14](sbe1445.htm#fr_929.md) Gautama XVII, 16.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[185:15](sbe1445.htm#fr_930.md) Vasish*th*a XIV,
37-38.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[185:16](sbe1445.htm#fr_931.md) Vasish*th*a XIII,
1-5. Govinda states that this Sûtra has been introduced here, because
the purity of one's food ensures <span id="page_186">p. 186</span>
purity of one's soul, and purity of soul gives strength of memory, and
thereby makes one fit to study the Veda.
