### PRA*S*NA I, ADHYÂYA 11, KA*ND*IKÂ 20.

1\. (There are) eight marriage-rites. <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[1](#fn_1022)

2\. If (the father) gives (his daughter) to a student (who has not
broken his vow of chastity and) who asks for her, after fully enquiring
into his learning and character, that (is) the rite .of Brahman
(brâhma). <span id="fr_1023"></span>[2](#fn_1023)

3\. If (the father gives his daughter away) after clothing her and
decking her with ornaments, (saying) 'That (is thy wife), fulfil the law
(with her),' that (is) the rite of Pra*g*âpati (prâ*g*âpatya). <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[3](#fn_1024)

4\. If (the bridegroom) after offering the first burnt oblation of
parched grain (receives the maiden) for a bull and a cow, that is the
rite of the *Ri*shis (ârsha). <span id="fr_1025"></span>[4](#fn_1025)

5\. If (a maiden is given) to an officiating priest within the
sacrificial enclosure, while the presents are being taken away, that
(is) the rite of the gods (daiva). <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[5](#fn_1026)

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

6\. The union of a lover with a loving damsel (is called) the rite of
the Gandharvas (gândharva).

7\. (If the bridegroom receives the maiden) after gladdening (the
parents) by money, (that is) the rite of the Asuras (âsura).

8\. (If the maiden is wedded) after being forcibly abducted, (that is)
the rite of the Râkshasas (râkshasa).

9\. If one has intercourse with (a maiden) who is sleeping, intoxicated,
or out of her senses (with fear or passion and weds her afterwards, that
is) the rite of the Pi*s*â*k*as (pai*s*â*k*a).

10\. Among these (eight rites) the four first (named) are (lawful) for a
Brâhma*n*a. Among these also each earlier named is preferable.

11\. Among the (four) later (named rites) each succeeding one is more
sinful (than the preceding ones).

12\. Among these the sixth and the seventh agree with the law of the
Kshatriyas. For power is their attribute.

6\. Vasish*th*a I, 33,

7\. Vasish*th*a I, 35.

8\. Vasish*th*a I, 34.

9\. Vish*n*u XXIV, 26.

10\. Vish*n*u XXIV, 27.

12\. Vish*n*u XXIV, 28; Vasish*th*a I, 29, 34. The meaning of the last
clause is that as, according to I, 10, 18, 3, Brahman placed power in
the Kshatriyas, they may adopt marriage rites by which a disregard of
conventionalities or strength is displayed.

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

13\. The fifth and the eighth (are lawful) for Vai*s*yas and
*S*ûdras. <span id="fr_1027"></span>[13](#fn_1027)

14\. For Vai*s*yas and *S*ûdras are not particular about their
wives, <span id="fr_1028"></span>[14](#fn_1028)

15\. Because they are allowed (to subsist by such low occupations as)
husbandry and service. <span id="fr_1029"></span>[15](#fn_1029)

16\. Some recommend the Gândharva rite for all (castes), because it is
based on (mutual) affection.

<span id="fn_1022"></span>[205:1](sbe1453.htm#fr_1022) **20**. Vish*n*u
XXIV, 17.

<span id="fn_1023"></span>[205:2](sbe1453.htm#fr_1023) Vasish*th*a I,
30. The word brahma*k*ârin has, no doubt, as Govinda too contends, been
used in the double sense of 'a student of the Veda' and 'chaste.'

<span id="fn_1024"></span>[205:3](sbe1453.htm#fr_1024) Vish*n*u XXIV,
22.

<span id="fn_1025"></span>[205:4](sbe1453.htm#fr_1025) Vasish*th*a I,
32. 'After the first of the burnt oblations of parched grain, which are
prescribed for weddings, has been offered, the bridegroom shall give to
him who has power over, the maiden a bull and a cow, and receive them
back together with the (bride).'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1026"></span>[205:5](sbe1453.htm#fr_1026) Vasish*th*a I,
31. According to this rule the damsel is given <span id="page_206">p.
206</span> as part of the sacrificial fee (dakshi*n*â) to one of the
priests after a sacrifice has been completed. Govinda adds that the
recipient has to accept the gift with the six mantras, 'pra*g*âpati
striyâ*m* ya*s*a*h*,' Taitt. Brâhma*n*a II, 4, 6, 5. In his commentary
on the passage Sâya*n*a makes the same statement. Govinda adds that in
this case as well as in those mentioned in the following Sûtras the
regular marriage ceremony must be performed later.

<span id="fn_1027"></span>[207:13](sbe1453.htm#fr_1027) 'I.e. the fifth
for Vai*s*yas and the eighth for *S*ûdras.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1028"></span>[207:14](sbe1453.htm#fr_1028) 'Those whose
spouse, i.e. wife, is not restrained, i.e. not fixed by rule, are called
not particular about their wives. The meaning is that there is oneness
(dâreshvaikyam) with respect to wives, that fixed rules regarding them
there are none (niyamas teshâ*m* na bhavati).'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1029"></span>[207:15](sbe1453.htm#fr_1029) '"Husbandry"
includes also trade and the like. Because those two (castes) are
permitted to pursue low occupations, therefore their marriage rites are
of the same description. That is what the author intends to
say.'--Govinda.
