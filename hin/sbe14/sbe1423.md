### CHAPTER XX.

1\. A penance (shall be performed) for an offence committed
unintentionally. <span id="fr_581"></span>[1](#fn_581.md)

2\. Some (declare that it shall be performed) also for (a fault)
committed intentionally.

3\. 'The spiritual teacher corrects the learned; the king corrects the
evil-minded; but Yama, the son of Vivasvat, forsooth, punishes those who
offend secretly.'

4\. And among those (sinful persons), let him who slept at sunrise stand
during the (following) day and recite the verse sacred to
Savit*ri*. <span id="fr_582"></span>[4](#fn_582.md)

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

5\. Let him who slept at sunset remain in a sitting posture during the
(next) night, likewise (reciting the Gâyatrî). <span
id="fr_583"></span>[5](#fn_583.md)

6\. But let a man with deformed nails or black teeth perform a
K*rikkh*ra penance of twelve days' duration. <span
id="fr_584"></span>[6](#fn_584.md)

7\. He whose younger brother married first shall perform a K*rikkh*ra
penance during twelve days, marry and take to himself even that (woman
whom his brother wedded). <span id="fr_585"></span>[7](#fn_585.md)

8\. Now he who has taken a wife before his elder brother shall perform a
K*rikkh*ra penance and an Atik*rikkh*ra penance, give (his wife) to that
(elder brother), marry again, and take (back) the same (woman whom he
wedded first).

9\. The husband of a younger sister married before her elder sister
shall perform a K*rikkh*ra penance during twelve days, marry and take to
him that (elder sister).

10\. The husband of an elder sister married after the younger one shall
perform a K*rikkh*ra penance and an Atik*rikkh*ra penance, give (his
wife) to that (husband of the younger sister and marry again). <span
id="fr_586"></span>[10](#fn_586.md)

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

11\. We shall, declare below (the penance prescribed for) him who
extinguishes the sacred fire. <span id="fr_587"></span>[11](#fn_587.md)

12\. He who has forgot the Veda (by neglecting to recite it daily),
shall perform a K*rikkh*ra penance of twelve days' duration, and again
learn it from his teacher. <span id="fr_588"></span>[12](#fn_588.md)

13\. He who violates a Guru's bed shall cut off his organ, together with
the testicles, take them into his joined hands and walk towards the
south wherever he meets with an obstacle (to further progress), there he
shall stand until he dies: <span id="fr_589"></span>[13](#fn_589.md)

14\. Or, having shaved all his hair and smeared his body with clarified
butter, he shall embrace the heated (iron) image (of a woman). It is
declared in the Veda that he is. purified after death, <span
id="fr_590"></span>[14](#fn_590.md)

15\. The same (expiation is prescribed if the offence was committed)
with the wife of the teacher, of a son, and of a pupil. <span
id="fr_591"></span>[15](#fn_591.md)

16\. If he has had intercourse with a female (who is considered)
venerable in the family, with a female friend, with the female friend of
a Guru, with an Apapâtra female, or with an outcast, he shall perform a
K*rikkh*ra penance during three months. <span
id="fr_592"></span>[16](#fn_592.md)

17\. The same (penance must be performed) for eating food given by a
*K*â*nd*âla or by an outcast. Afterwards the initiation (must be
performed) once more; but the tonsure and the rest may be omitted.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

18\. And with reference to this (matter) they quote a verse proclaimed
by Manu, 'The tonsure, (the tying on of) the sacred girdle, (the wearing
of) a staff, and the begging of alias, these acts may be omitted on a
second initiation.' <span id="fr_593"></span>[18](#fn_593.md)

19\. If (a Brâhma*n*a) intentionally (drinks) other spirituous liquor
than that distilled from rice, or if he unintentionally (drinks)
spirituous liquor extracted from rice (surâ), he (must perform) a
K*rikkh*ra and an Atik*rikkh*ra, and, after eating clarified butter, be
initiated again. <span id="fr_594"></span>[19](#fn_594.md)

20\. The same (expiation is prescribed) for swallowing ordure, urine,
and semen.

21\. If a Brâhma*n*a drinks water which has stood in a vessel used for
(keeping) spirituous liquor, he becomes pure by drinking, during three
days, water (mixed with a decoction) of lotus, Udumbara, Bilva, and
Palâ*s*a (leaves). <span id="fr_595"></span>[21](#fn_595.md)

22\. But a Brâhma*n*a who repeatedly (and intentionally partakes) of
liquor extracted from rice, shall drink (liquor of) the same (kind)
boiling hot. 'He becomes pure after death.' <span
id="fr_596"></span>[22](#fn_596.md)

23\. We will declare (who must be considered) the slayer of a learned
Brâhma*n*a (bhrû*n*ahan). He is called Bhrû*n*ahan who kills a
Brâhma*n*a or destroys an embryo (the sex of) which is unknown. <span
id="fr_597"></span>[23](#fn_597.md)

24\. 'For embryos (the sex of) which is unknown <span
id="fr_598"></span>[24](#fn_598.md)

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

become males; therefore they offer burnt-oblations for the production of
males.'

25\. Let the slayer of a learned Brâhma*n*a kindle a fire and offer
(therein the following eight oblations, consisting of portions of his
own body), <span id="fr_599"></span>[25](#fn_599.md)

26\. The first (saying), 'I offer my hair to Death, I feed Death with my
hair;' the second (saying), I offer my skin to Death, I feed Death with
my skin;' the third (saying), 'I offer my blood to Death, I feed Death
with my blood;' the fourth (saying), I offer my flesh to Death, I feed
Death with my flesh;' the fifth (saying), 'I offer my sinews to Death, I
feed Death with my sinews;' the sixth (saying), 'I offer my fat to
Death, I feed Death with my fat;' the seventh (saying), 'I offer my
bones to Death, I feed Death with my bones;' the eighth (saying), 'I
offer my marrow to Death, I feed Death with my marrow.'

27\. (Or) let him (fight) for the sake of the king, or for the sake of
Brâhma*n*as, and let him die in battle with his face turned (to the
foe). <span id="fr_600"></span>[27](#fn_600.md)

28\. It is declared in the Veda, '(A murderer) who remains thrice
unvanquished or is thrice defeated (in battle) becomes pure.' <span
id="fr_601"></span>[28](#fn_601.md)

29\. 'A sin which is openly proclaimed becomes smaller.' <span
id="fr_602"></span>[29](#fn_602.md)

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

30\. To this (effect) they quote also (the following verse): 'By saying
to an outcast, "O thou outcast!" or to a thief, "O thou thief!" a man
incurs a guilt as great as (that of the offender). (If he) falsely
(accuses anybody of such offences), his guilt will be twice as
great.' <span id="fr_603"></span>[30](#fn_603.md)

31\. In like manner having slain a Kshatriya, he shall perform (a
penance) during eight years, <span id="fr_604"></span>[31](#fn_604.md)

32\. For (killing) a Vai*s*ya during six (years), <span
id="fr_605"></span>[32](#fn_605.md)

33\. For (killing) a *S*ûdra, during three (years), <span
id="fr_606"></span>[33](#fn_606.md)

34\. For killing a female of the Brâhma*n*a caste who is an Atreyî, and
a Kshatriya or a Vai*s*ya, engaged in a sacrifice (the same penance must
be performed as for killing a learned Brâhma*n*a). <span
id="fr_607"></span>[34](#fn_607.md)

35\. We will explain (the term) Atreyî. They declare that she who has
bathed after temporary uncleanness is an Atreyî.

36\. 'For if (the husband) approaches her at that (time), he will have
offspring.' <span id="fr_608"></span>[36](#fn_608.md)

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

37\. (For killing a female of the Brâhma*n*a caste) who is not an
Âtreyî, (the penance prescribed) for the murder of a Kshatriya (must be
performed), <span id="fr_609"></span>[37](#fn_609.md)

38\. (For killing) a female of the Kshatriya caste, (the penance
prescribed) for the murder of a Vai*s*ya,

39\. (For killing) a female of the Vai*s*ya caste, (the penance
prescribed) for the murder of a *S*ûdra.

40\. (For killing) a female of the *S*ûdra caste (let him perform)
during one year (the penance prescribed for the murder of a Brâhma*n*a).

41\. If a man has stolen gold belonging to a Brâhma*n*a, he shall run,
with flying hair, to the king, (exclaiming) 'Ho, I am a thief; sir,
punish me!' The king shall give him a weapon made of Udumbara wood; with
that he shall kill himself. It is declared in the Veda that he becomes
pure after death. <span id="fr_610"></span>[41](#fn_610.md)

42\. Or (such a thief) may shave off all his hair, anoint his body with
clarified butter, and cause himself to be burnt from the feet upwards,
in a fire of dry cowdung. It is declared in the Veda that he becomes
pure after death. <span id="fr_611"></span>[42](#fn_611.md)

43\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Hear, (how) the bodies
of those who having committed various crimes died a long time ago, and
were (afterwards) born again, are (marked);'

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

44\. 'A thief will have deformed nails, the murderer of a Brâhma*n*a
will be afflicted with white leprosy, but he who has drunk spirituous
liquor will have black teeth, and the violator of his Guru's bed will
suffer from skin diseases.' <span id="fr_612"></span>[44](#fn_612.md)

45\. Property received from outcasts, after forming alliances with them
either by (teaching) the Veda (and by sacrificing) or by marriage, must
be relinquished. Let him not associate with such (men). <span
id="fr_613"></span>[45](#fn_613.md)

46\. It is declared in the Veda that (he who has associated with
outcasts) becomes pure by reciting the Sa*m*hitâ (of his Veda),
proceeding in a northerly direction and fasting. <span
id="fr_614"></span>[46](#fn_614.md)

47\. They quote also (a verse) to this (effect), 'A sinner is liberated
from guilt by tormenting his body, by austerities, and by reciting the
Veda; he becomes also free by bestowing gifts. That has been declared in
the Veda.'

<span id="fn_597"></span>[105:23](sbe1423.htm#fr_597.md) Gautama XXII, 13.
It must be understood a real Brâhma*n*a who knows the Veda is meant.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[105:24](sbe1423.htm#fr_598.md) 'Therefore they
offer burnt-oblations for the production of males,' i.e. they perform
the Pu*m*savana, one of the sacraments; <span id="page_107">p.
107</span> see e*g*. Â*s*valâyana I, 13. The Sûtra is marked as a
quotation, and probably belongs to some Vedic work.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[106:25](sbe1423.htm#fr_599.md) Âpastamba I, 9,
25, 12.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[106:27](sbe1423.htm#fr_600.md) Gautama XXII, 8.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[106:28](sbe1423.htm#fr_601.md) Âpastamba I, 9,
24, 21.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[106:29](sbe1423.htm#fr_602.md) Taken by itself
the Sûtra would seem to refer to the maxim that a free confession
reduces the guilt of the offender (Manu XI, 228). But on account of the
next Sûtra it is necessary to assume, with K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita, that
half the guilt of a crime, of which another man justly accuses an
offender, falls on the accuser, while the <span id="page_107">p.
107</span> offender's guilt becomes less by the publication of his
misdeed. It is, however, not improbable that the text is here defective,
and one or several Sûtras have been left out.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[107:30](sbe1423.htm#fr_603.md) Gautama XXI,
17-18.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[107:31](sbe1423.htm#fr_604.md) Vish*n*u L, 12.
The text is here evidently defective. The Sutra or Sûtras left out must
have contained the description of another penance for the murder of a
Brâhma*n*a, which is mentioned in nearly all the Sm*ri*tis (see Vish*n*u
L, 1-6, 15, and the parallel passages). Its chief conditions are, that
the murderer is to live separate for twelve years, and to subsist on
alms given by people who are acquainted with his crime. Without such an
additional rule this and the following Sûtras are utterly
unintelligible.

<span id="fn_605"></span>[107:32](sbe1423.htm#fr_605.md) Vish*n*u L, 13.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[107:33](sbe1423.htm#fr_606.md) Vish*n*u L, 14.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[107:34](sbe1423.htm#fr_607.md) Vish*n*u L, 7, 9.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[107:36](sbe1423.htm#fr_608.md) The author means
to say that the word âtreyî is derived from atra, at that time,' and the
verb i, 'to approach.' The etymology is worthy of the Nirukta.

<span id="fn_609"></span>[108:37](sbe1423.htm#fr_609.md)-40. Gautama XXII,
17.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[108:41](sbe1423.htm#fr_610.md) Vish*n*u LII, 1-2.
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita remarks that *S*ûlapâ*n*i explains audumbaram,
'made of Udumbara wood,' by 'made of copper,' and that the weapon
intended is a club. The last remark is probably true, as the parallel
passages of the other Sm*ri*tis state that the thief is to take a club
to the king, with which he is to be struck.
