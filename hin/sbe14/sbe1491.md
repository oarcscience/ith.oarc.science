# PARI*S*ISH*T*A.

### PRA*S*NA VII, ADHYÂYA 5.

1\. We will explain the rule for the adoption of a son. <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1](#fn_1464)

2\. Man, formed of virile seed and uterine blood, proceeds from his
mother and father (as an effect) from its cause. <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[2](#fn_1465)

3\. (Therefore) the father and the mother have power to give, to
abandon, or to sell their (son).

4\. But let him not give nor receive (in adoption) an only son;

5\. For he (must remain) to continue the line of the ancestors.

6\. Let a woman neither give nor receive a son except with the
permission of her husband.

7\. He who is desirous of adopting (a son) procures two garments, two
earrings, and a finger-ring; a spiritual guide who has studied the whole
Veda; a layer of Ku*s*a grass and fuel of Palâ*s*a wood and so
forth. <span id="fr_1466"></span>[7](#fn_1466)

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

8\. Then he convenes his relations, informs the king (of his intention
to adopt) in (their) presence, feeds the (invited) Brâhma*n*as in the
assembly or in (his) dwelling, and makes them wish him 'an auspicious
day,' 'hail,' (and) 'prosperity.' <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[8](#fn_1467)

9\. Then he performs the ceremonies which begin with the drawing of the
lines on the altar and end with the placing of the water-vessels, goes
to the giver (of the child) and should address (this) request (to him),
'Give me (thy) son.'

10\. The other answers, 'I give (him).'

11\. He receives (the child with these words), 'I take thee for the
fulfilment of (my) religious duties; I take thee to continue the line
(of my ancestors).'

12\. Then he adorns him with the (above-mentioned) two garments, the two
earrings, and the finger-ring, performs the rites which begin with the
placing of the (pieces of wood called) paridhis (fences round the altar)
and end with the Agnimukha, and offers (a portion) of the cooked (food)
in the fire. <span id="fr_1468"></span>[12](#fn_1468)

13\. Having recited the Puronuvâkyâ (verse), 'He who thinking of thee
with a discerning mind,' &c., he offers an oblation, reciting the
Yâ*g*yâ (verse), 'To which performer of good deeds, thou, O
*G*âtavedas,' &c. <span id="fr_1469"></span>[13](#fn_1469)

14\. Then he offers (oblations, reciting) the Vyâh*ri*tis;--(the
ceremonies) which begin the oblation to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t and end
with the presentation <span id="fr_1470"></span>[14](#fn_1470)

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

of a cow as a fee (to the officiating priest are) known;--

15\. And presents (to the spiritual guide) as a sacrificial fee those
two dresses, those two earrings, and that finger-ring (with which he had
adorned the child).

16\. If after the performance of these (rites) a legitimate son of his
own body is born (to the adopter, then the adopted son) receives a
fourth (of the legitimate son's) share. Thus says Baudhâyana. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1464"></span>[334:1](sbe1491.htm#fr_1464) **5**. This
chapter has been translated by Mr. Sutherland, Dattaka Mîmâ*m*sâ V, 42,
and Dattaka *K*andrikâ II, 16, and by myself, journal Bengal Br. Roy.
As. Soc., vol. XXXV, p.162.

<span id="fn_1465"></span>[334:2](sbe1491.htm#fr_1465)-6. Identical with
Vasish*th*a XV, 1-5. The best MS. omits the particle tu, 'but,' in Sûtra
6, while others have it.

<span id="fn_1466"></span>[334:7](sbe1491.htm#fr_1466)-8. Vasish*th*a
XV, 7. The translation of madhye by 'in their presence' rests on the
authority of the Sa*m*skârakaustubha 47 b, 11, where it is explained
madhye \[a\] iti bandhusamaksham. The other explanation 'in the middle
(of his dwelling),' to which the interpolated text of the Dattaka
Mîmâ*m*sâ and Dattaka *K*andrikrâ refers, is, however, also possible.

<span id="fn_1467"></span>[335:8](sbe1491.htm#fr_1467) The ceremony
alluded to is the so-called pu*n*yâhavâ*k*anam.

<span id="fn_1468"></span>[335:12](sbe1491.htm#fr_1468) The correct
reading is pakvâ*g* *g*uhoti.

<span id="fn_1469"></span>[335:13](sbe1491.htm#fr_1469) The two texts
are found Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ I, 4, 46, I.

<span id="fn_1470"></span>[335:14](sbe1491.htm#fr_1470) Vasish*th*a XV,
7. The parenthetical phrase occurs frequently in the Dharma-sûtra;. see
e.g. III, 4, 3.

<span id="fn_1471"></span>[336:16](sbe1491.htm#fr_1471) Vasish*th*a XV,
9.
