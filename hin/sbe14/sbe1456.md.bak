### PRA*S*NA II, ADHYÂYA 1, KA*ND*IKÂ 2.

1\. Now (follow the offences) causing loss of caste (patanîya), <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1](#fn_1077.md)

2\. (Viz.) making voyages by sea, <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[2](#fn_1078.md)

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

3\. Stealing the property of a Brâhma*n*a or a deposit,

4\. Giving false evidence regarding land,

5\. Trading with merchandise of any description (whether forbidden or
not),

6\. Serving *S*ûdras,

7\. Begetting a son on a female of the *S*ûdra caste, <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[7](#fn_1079.md)

8\. And becoming thereby her son. <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[8](#fn_1080.md)

9\. (For those who have) committed one of these (offences the following
penance is prescribed); <span id="fr_1081"></span>[9](#fn_1081.md)

10\. 'They shall eat every fourth meal-time a little food, bathe at the
time of the three libations (morning, noon, and evening), passing (the
day) standing and (the night) sitting. After the lapse of three years
they throw off their guilt.' <span id="fr_1082"></span>[10](#fn_1082.md)

11\. 'A Brâhma*n*a removes the sin which he committed by serving the
black race during one day and one night, if he bathes during three years
at every fourth meal-time.' <span id="fr_1083"></span>[11](#fn_1083.md)

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

12\. Now (follow) the minor offences, entailing loss of caste
(upapâtaka), <span id="fr_1084"></span>[12](#fn_1084.md)

13\. (Viz.) intercourse with females who must not be approached (agamyâ,
e.g.) cohabitation with the female friend of a female Guru, with the
female friend of a male Guru, with an Apapâtra woman, and a female
outcast, following the profession of medicine, sacrificing for many,
living by (performances on) the stage, following the profession of a
teacher of dancing, singing and acting, tending cows and buffalos, and
similar (low occupations, as well as) fornication. <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[13](#fn_1085.md)

14\. The expiation (prescribed) for these (offences is) to live as an
outcast during two years. <span id="fr_1086"></span>[14](#fn_1086.md)

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

15\. Now (follow the offences) which make men impure
(asu*k*ikara), <span id="fr_1087"></span>[15](#fn_1087.md)

16\. (Viz.) gambling, performing incantations, subsisting by gleaning
corn though one does not perform an Agnihotra, subsisting by alms after
one has finished one's studentship, living, after that has been
finished, longer than four months in the house of one's teacher, and
teaching such a (person who has finished his studentship), gaining one's
livelihood by astrology and so forth. <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[16](#fn_1088.md)

17\. But the expiation of these (offences is to perform penances) during
twelve months, during twelve fortnights, during twelve times ten days,
during twelve se’nnights, during twelve times three days, during twelve
days, during six days, during three days, during a day and a night,
during one day, in proportion to the offence committed. <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[17](#fn_1089.md)

18\. Now outcasts shall live together and (together) fulfil their
duties, sacrificing for each other, teaching each other, and marrying
amongst each other. If they have begot sons, they shall say to them,
'Depart from among us; thus you will again reach the Âryas.' <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[18](#fn_1090.md)

19\. For the organs do not become impure together with the man.

20\. (The truth of) that may be learned from this (parallel case); a man
deficient in limbs begets a son who has the full number of limbs.

21\. Hârîta declares that this is wrong.

22\. For wives may be (considered) similar to the

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

vessel which contains the curds (for the sacrifice). If one makes impure
milk curdle in a milk-vessel and stirs it, the *S*ish*t*as do not use
the (curds thus produced) for sacred rites.

23\. In like manner no intercourse can be held with that (offspring)
which is produced from impure seed.

24\. If they desire it, (they may perform) a penance,

25\. (Viz. in the case of males) the third part (of the penance
prescribed) for crimes causing loss of caste (patanîya); for females the
third part (of that). <span id="fr_1091"></span>[25](#fn_1091.md)

26\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'If he applies sesamum
to any other purpose, but food, anointing, and charitable gifts, he will
be born again as a worm and, together with his ancestors, be plunged
into the ordure of dogs.' <span id="fr_1092"></span>[26](#fn_1092.md)

27\. He who sells sesamum, forsooth, sells his ancestors; he who sells
rice, forsooth, sells his life; he who gives away his daughter, making a
bargain, forsooth, sells portions of his spiritual merit.

28\. Grass and wood, in its natural state, may be sold. <span
id="fr_1093"></span>[28](#fn_1093.md)

29\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Animals that have teeth
in one jaw only, as well as minerals excepting salt, and undyed thread,
these, O Brâhma*n*a, are the goods which thou art permitted to
sell.' <span id="fr_1094"></span>[29](#fn_1094.md)

30\. (If he has committed) any offence excepting a <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[30](#fn_1095.md)

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

mortal sin (pâtaka) he may either give to a learned Brâhma*n*a
(anû*k*âna) a hairy cow of brown or red-dish colour, after sprinkling
her with clarified butter and scattering black sesamum seeds over her;

31\. Or (he may offer burnt oblations), reciting the Kûshmâ*nd*as,
during twelve days, <span id="fr_1096"></span>[31](#fn_1096.md)

32\. '(Thus) he will be freed. from the guilt (of any crime that is)
less (heinous) than the murder of a learned Brâhma*n*a.'

33\. If one is accused of a mortal sin (pâtaka), a K*rikkh*ra (penance
must be performed by the accused). <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[33](#fn_1097.md)

34\. The accuser (shall perform) that (K*rikkh*ra penance during) a
year. <span id="fr_1098"></span>[34](#fn_1098.md)

35\. 'He who during a year associates with an outcast, becomes
(likewise) an outcast; not by sacrificing for *h*im, by teaching him or
by (forming) a matrimonial (alliance with him), but by using the same
carriage or seat.' <span id="fr_1099"></span>[35](#fn_1099.md)

36\. The penance for eating impure substances is to fast until the
entrails are empty. That is attained in seven (days and) nights. <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[36](#fn_1100.md)

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

37\. (Subsisting on) water, milk, clarified butter, (and) fasting,--each
for three days,--(and taking the three fluids) hot, that is a
Taptak*rikkh*ra penance. <span id="fr_1101"></span>[37](#fn_1101.md)

38\. (Eating) during three days in the morning only, during the (next)
three days in the evening only, (subsisting) during (another) three days
(on) food given unasked, and fasting during three days, (that is) a
K*rikkh*ra penance. <span id="fr_1102"></span>[38](#fn_1102.md)

39\. (If the period of twelve days is divided into) three (periods of)
four days, that is the K*rikkh*ra penance of, women, children, and aged
men. <span id="fr_1103"></span>[39](#fn_1103.md)

40\. If (observing the rule given) above one eats (at each meal) so much
only as one can take at one (mouthful), that is an Atik*rikkh*ra
penance. <span id="fr_1104"></span>[40](#fn_1104.md)

41\. (If one) subsists on water only, that is a K*rikkh*râtik*rikkh*ra,
the third (in the order of the K*rikkh*ra penances). <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[41](#fn_1105.md)

42\. During a K*rikkh*ra penance (the following rules must be followed,
viz.) to bathe at morn, noon, and evening, <span
id="fr_1106"></span>[42](#fn_1106.md)

43\. To sleep on the ground,

44\. To wear one garment only, to shave the hair of the head, of the
beard, and of the body, and to clip the nails.

45\. The same (rules apply) to women except (that referring to) shaving
the head.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1077"></span>[217:1](sbe1456.htm#fr_1077.md) **2**. Âpastamba
I, 7, 21, 7-11.

<span id="fn_1078"></span>[217:2](sbe1456.htm#fr_1078.md) Govinda explains
samudrasa*m*yânam, 'making voyages by sea,' by 'voyaging by means of
ships to another continent (dvîpa).'

<span id="fn_1079"></span>[218:7](sbe1456.htm#fr_1079.md) The MSS. from
Gu*g*arât and the Dekhan read instead of-this and the next Sûtras,
ya*sk*a *s*ûdrâyâm abhipra*g*âyate tadapatya*m* *k*a bhavati, 'and he
who begets (offspring) on a *S*ûdra female, and thereby becomes her
son.'

<span id="fn_1080"></span>[218:8](sbe1456.htm#fr_1080.md) Govinda explains
the Sûtra as a prohibition against allowing oneself to be adopted by a
*S*ûdra (*s*ûdraputrabhâva*h* \| tavâham putro ’smîty upa*g*îvanam).

<span id="fn_1081"></span>[218:9](sbe1456.htm#fr_1081.md) The Dekhan and
Gu*g*arât MSS. again have a different reading, teshâ*m* to nisvesha*h*,
'but the atonement of these offences (is as follows).'

<span id="fn_1082"></span>[218:10](sbe1456.htm#fr_1082.md) Âpastamba I, 9,
25, 10. All the MSS. read in the last pâda 'tribhir varshais tad
apahanti pâpam.' The correct reading is that given by Âpastamba loc.
cit., 'tribhir varshair apa pâpa*m* nudante.'

<span id="fn_1083"></span>[218:11](sbe1456.htm#fr_1083.md) Âpastamba I, 9,
27, 11. Govinda explains the Sûtra as referring to cohabitation with a
female of the 'black race.' By the latter term he understands a
*K*â*nd*âlî, adding that others believe <span id="page_219">p.
219</span> a *S*ûdra female to be intended. It is, however, more
probable that Baudhâyana took the verse to forbid twice-born men to
serve *S*ûdras.

<span id="fn_1084"></span>[219:12](sbe1456.htm#fr_1084.md) Âpastamba I, 7,
21, 9.

<span id="fn_1085"></span>[219:13](sbe1456.htm#fr_1085.md) Gautama XXI, is.
In explanation of the term agamyâ, a female who must not be approached,'
Govinda quotes Nârada XII, 73-74, and he takes the four classes of
females, who are specially mentioned, not as examples illustrating the
term agamyâ, but as not included in and additional to the latter.
Physicians and the other professional men enumerated are usually not
mentioned among the upapâtakins, but occur in the lists of those whose
gifts must not be accepted, and of those who defile the, company at a
funeral dinner, e*g*. Vasish*th*a III, 3; XIV, 2, 3, 11. The expression
'sacrificing for many' (grâmayâ*g*anam) appears to be a description of
the so-called 'Ya*g*amâna V*ri*tti, by which the modern Bha*tt*agîs, or
priests who officiate for hire, subsist. In explanation of the term
nâ*t*yâ*k*âryatâ, 'following the profession of teaching dancing, music,
and acting,' Govinda says that 'instruction in the works of Bharata,
Vi*s*âkhila, and others' is intended. Baudhâyana no doubt intends to
forbid the instruction of professional dancers and actors in actual
works on their art, such as the nâ*t*ya-sûtras mentioned by Pâ*n*ini.

<span id="fn_1086"></span>[219:14](sbe1456.htm#fr_1086.md) 'To live as an
outcast, i.e. to subsist by begging.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1087"></span>[220:15](sbe1456.htm#fr_1087.md) Âpastamba I, 7,
21, 12-19; I, 10, 29, 15.

<span id="fn_1088"></span>[220:16](sbe1456.htm#fr_1088.md) Govinda is
probably right in asserting that the word *k*a, 'and (so forth),' is
intended to include other not-named offences.

<span id="fn_1089"></span>[220:17](sbe1456.htm#fr_1089.md) Âpastamba I, 10,
29, 17-18.

<span id="fn_1090"></span>[220:18](sbe1456.htm#fr_1090.md)-23. Âpastamba I,
10, 29, 8-14.

<span id="fn_1091"></span>[221:25](sbe1456.htm#fr_1091.md) I.e. males shall
live, according to the rules given above in Sûtras 10-11, during one
year, and females during four months.

<span id="fn_1092"></span>[221:26](sbe1456.htm#fr_1092.md) Vasish*th*a II,
30.

<span id="fn_1093"></span>[221:28](sbe1456.htm#fr_1093.md) Âpastamba I, 7,
21, 2.

<span id="fn_1094"></span>[221:29](sbe1456.htm#fr_1094.md) The permission
to sell 'stones' or minerals contradicts Vasish*th*a II, 24.

<span id="fn_1095"></span>[221:30](sbe1456.htm#fr_1095.md) Regarding the
definition of the term 'anû*k*âna,' see above, I, 11, 21, 13.

<span id="fn_1096"></span>[222:31](sbe1456.htm#fr_1096.md) Regarding the
efficacy of the Kûshmâ*nd*a texts, see e*g*. Gautama XIX, 12; XXII, 36.

<span id="fn_1097"></span>[222:33](sbe1456.htm#fr_1097.md) Vasish*th*a
XXIII, 37-38.

<span id="fn_1098"></span>[222:34](sbe1456.htm#fr_1098.md) Vasish*th*a
XXIII, 39.

<span id="fn_1099"></span>[222:35](sbe1456.htm#fr_1099.md) Vasish*th*a I,
22.

<span id="fn_1100"></span>[222:36](sbe1456.htm#fr_1100.md) Âpastamba I, 9,
27, 3-4; Vasish*th*a XXIII, 30. I follow here the Gu*g*arât and Dekhan
MSS., which read amedhyaprâ*s*ane prâya*sk*ittir naishpurîshya*m* tat
saptarâtre*n*âvâpyate. M. and the two MSS. of the commentary give
amedhyaprâ*s*ane prâya*sk*ittam and leave the remainder out. The
commentary states that the penance intended is the Taptak*rikkh*ra,
described in the next Sutra. The parallel passages of Âpastamba and
others leave no doubt that the northern MSS. in this case have preserved
the older form of the text.

<span id="fn_1101"></span>[223:37](sbe1456.htm#fr_1101.md) Vasish*th*a XXI,
21.

<span id="fn_1102"></span>[223:38](sbe1456.htm#fr_1102.md) Vasish*th*a XXI,
20. M. and the two MSS. of the commentary omit the word 'k*rikkh*ra*h*'
at the end of the Sûtra.

<span id="fn_1103"></span>[223:39](sbe1456.htm#fr_1103.md) Vasish*th*a
XXIII, 43.

<span id="fn_1104"></span>[223:40](sbe1456.htm#fr_1104.md) Vasish*th*a
XXIV, 2.

<span id="fn_1105"></span>[223:41](sbe1456.htm#fr_1105.md) Vasish*th*a
XXIV, 3. Govinda gives another explanation of the word t*ri*tîya*h*,
'the third,' according to which it is to refer to the third tryaha*h*,
or 'period of three days.'

<span id="fn_1106"></span>[223:42](sbe1456.htm#fr_1106.md)-44. Vasish*th*a
XXIV, 4-5.
