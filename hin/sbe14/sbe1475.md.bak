### PRA*S*NA III, ADHYÂYA 3.

1\. Now the hermits in the wood belong to two classes, <span
id="fr_1349"></span>[1](#fn_1349.md)

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

2\. Those who cook (their food), and those who do not cook it.

3\. Among them, those who cook (their food are divided) into five
subdivisions, (viz.) those who eat everything which the forest contains,
those who live on unhusked (wild-growing grain), those who eat bulbs and
roots, those who eat fruit, and those who eat pot-herbs.

4\. Those who eat everything which the forest produces are, again, of
two kinds: they either subsist on forest-produce generated by Indra, or
on that which has been generated from semen.

5\. Among these, that which has been generated by Indra (is the produce)
of lianas, shrubs, creepers, and trees. Fetching (that) and cooking it,
they offer the Agnihotra in the evening and in the morning, give (food)
to ascetics, guests, and students, and eat the remainder.

6\. That which is generated from semen is the flesh (of animals) slain
by tigers, wolves, falcons, and other (carnivorous beasts), or by one of
them. Fetching (that) and cooking it, they offer the Agnihotra in the
evening and in the morning, give (shares) to ascetics, guests, and
students, and eat the remainder.

7\. Those who eat unhusked grain only, fetch rice, avoiding (husked)
corn, boil it, offer the Agnihotra both in the evening and in the
morning, give (food) to ascetics, guests, and students, and eat the
remainder.

8\. Those who eat bulbs and roots, or fruit, or pot-herbs, (act) exactly
in the same manner.

9\. Those (hermits) who do not cook (their food are divided into) five
(classes), Unma*gg*akas, Prav*ri*ttâ*s*ins,

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Mukhenâdâyins, Toyâhâras, and Vâyubhakshas.

10\. Among these, the Unma*gg*akas (collect and prepare their food),
avoiding (the use of) iron and stone implements,

11\. The Prav*ri*ttâ*s*ins take it with the hand, <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[11](#fn_1350.md)

12\. The Mukhenâdâyins take it with the mouth (only, like beasts),

13\. The Toyâhâras subsist on water only,

14\. And the Vâyubhakshas (air-eaters) eat nothing.

15\. In this manner ten (different) initiations are prescribed for
hermits who follow the rule of Vikhanas (vaikhânasa). <span
id="fr_1351"></span>[15](#fn_1351.md)

16\. He who has agreed (to obey) the Institutes of his (order, shall
wear) a staff, (shall keep) rigid silence, and (shall) abstain from rash
acts.

17\. Hermits following the rule of Vikhanas (vaikhânasa) are purified
(from sin), and (especially) those who abstain from food.

18\. The sum of the rules applicable to all Brahma-Vaikhânasas (is as
follows): <span id="fr_1352"></span>[18](#fn_1352.md)

19\. 'Let him not injure (even) gadflies or gnats; let him bear cold and
perform austerities; let him constantly reside in the forest, be
contented, and

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

delight in (dresses made of) bark and skins, (and in carrying) water (in
his pot).'

20\. 'A devotee shall first honour the guests who have come to his
hermitage at (dinner) time; he shall be sedulous in (worshipping) gods
and Brâhma*n*as, in (offering) the Agnihotra, and in practising
austerities.'

21\. "A Brâhma*n*a who has taken to forest-life, and who has adopted
this difficult (but) pure mode of existence, which keeps him apart from
wicked men, which must never be given up, which is similar to (that of
the) beasts and birds, which allows the collection of the necessaries of
life for one day only, and which necessitates the consumption of
astringent and bitter (food), never sinks low.'

22\. 'Moving about with the beasts, dwelling together with them, and
maintaining oneself in a manner similar to theirs, that is clearly the
road to heaven.' <span id="fr_1353"></span>[22](#fn_1353.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1349"></span>[291:1](sbe1475.htm#fr_1349.md) **3**. Compare
for the whole Adhyâya, Âpastamba II, 9, 21, 20-23, 2.

<span id="fn_1350"></span>[293:11](sbe1475.htm#fr_1350.md)
Prav*ri*ttâ*s*in, i.e. he who eats food only which comes to him
accidentally.

<span id="fn_1351"></span>[293:15](sbe1475.htm#fr_1351.md)-17. These three
Sûtras are omitted in the commentary, but found in all the MSS. of the
text.

<span id="fn_1352"></span>[293:18](sbe1475.htm#fr_1352.md) Govinda proposes
two explanations for the term brahmavaikhânasa; he thinks that it may
mean either brahma*n*â d*ri*sh*t*â vaikhânasâ*h*, 'hermits seen by
Brahman,' i.e. whose duties have been revealed by Brahman, or 'hermits
who are Brâhma*n*as by caste.' The true sense, however, is probably 'a
hermit (who strives) to (become one with) Brahman' (brahmârtha*m*
valikhânasa).

<span id="fn_1353"></span>[294:22](sbe1475.htm#fr_1353.md) See above, III,
2, 19.
