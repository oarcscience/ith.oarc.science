### PRA*S*NA II, ADHYÂYA 2, KA*ND*IKÂ 3.

1\. A Brâhma*n*a who always carries water (in his pot), who always wears
the sacred thread, who daily recites the Veda, who avoids the food of
*S*ûdras, who approaches (his wife) in the proper season, and offers
sacrifices in accordance with the rules (of the Veda, after death) never
falls from Brahman's heaven. <span id="fr_1107"></span>[1](#fn_1107.md)

2\. The Veda (says), 'Manu divided his estate among his sons.' <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[2](#fn_1108.md)

3\. (A father may, therefore, divide his property) equally among all,
without (making any) difference; <span id="fr_1109"></span>[3](#fn_1109.md)

4\. Or the eldest may receive the most excellent chattel. <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[4](#fn_1110.md)

5\. (For) the Veda says, 'Therefore, they distinguish the eldest by (an
additional share of the) property. <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[5](#fn_1111.md)

6\. Or the eldest may receive (in excess) one part out of ten; <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[6](#fn_1112.md)

7\. (And) the other (sons) shall receive equal shares. <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[7](#fn_1113.md)

8\. While the father lives, the division of the estate takes place
(only) with the permission of the father. <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[8](#fn_1114.md)

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

9\. The (additional) share of the eldest is, (according to the order) of
the four castes, a cow, a horse, a goat, and a sheep. <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[9](#fn_1115.md)

10\. If there are sons born of wives of different castes (var*n*a), they
should make ten portions of the ancestral property and take four
(shares), three, two, (and) one, according to the order (of the
castes). <span id="fr_1116"></span>[10](#fn_1116.md)

11\. But if a legitimate son of the body (aurasa) is born, the (other)
sons of equal caste shall obtain one third share (of the estate). <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[11](#fn_1117.md)

12\. If there is a son of equal caste and a son of <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[12](#fn_1118.md)

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

a wife of the next lower caste, the son born of the wife of the next
lower caste may take the share of the eldest, provided he be endowed
with good qualities.

13\. (A son) who possesses good qualities becomes the protector of the
rest. <span id="fr_1119"></span>[13](#fn_1119.md)

14\. One must know a son begotten by (the husband) himself on a wedded
wife of equal caste (to be) a legitimate son of the body (aurasa). <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[14](#fn_1120.md)

Now they quote also (the following verse): 'From the several limbs (of
my body) art thou produced, from my heart art thou born; thou art "self"
called a son; mayest thou live a hundred autumns.' <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[15](#fn_1121.md)

15\. The (male child) born of a daughter, after an agreement has been
made, (one must know to be) the son of an appointed daughter
(putrikâputra); any other (male offspring of a daughter they call) a
daughter's son (dauhitra).

16\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The son of an appointed
daughter should offer the first funeral cake to his mother, the second
to her father, and the third to his father's father.'

17\. He who is begotten, by another man, on the wife of a deceased man,
of a eunuch, or of one (incurably) diseased, after permission (has been
given), is called the son begotten on a wife (kshetra*g*a). <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[17](#fn_1122.md)

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

18\. Such a (son begotten on a wife) has two fathers and belongs to two
families; he has a right to perform the funeral oblations, and to
inherit the property of (his) two (fathers). <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[18](#fn_1123.md)

19\. Now they quote also (the following verse): The son of two fathers
shall give the funeral cakes (to his two fathers, and pronounce) two
names with each oblation, and three cakes shall serve for six persons;
he who acts thus will not err.'

20\. He (is called) an adopted son (datta) who, being given by his
father and his mother, or by either of the two, is received in the place
of a child. <span id="fr_1124"></span>[20](#fn_1124.md)

21\. He (is called) a son made (k*ri*trima) whom (a mail) himself makes
(his son), with the (adoptee's) consent (only), and who belongs to the
same caste (as the adopter). <span id="fr_1125"></span>[21](#fn_1125.md)

22\. He is called a son born secretly (gû*dh*agga) who is secretly born
in the house and whose (origin is) afterwards (only) recognised. <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[22](#fn_1126.md)

23\. He is called a son cast off (apaviddha) who, being, cast off by his
father and his mother, or by either (of them), is received in the place
of a child. <span id="fr_1127"></span>[23](#fn_1127.md)

24\. If anybody approaches an unmarried girl without the permission (of
her father or guardian), the son born by such (a woman is called) the
son of an unmarried damsel (kânîna). <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[24](#fn_1128.md)

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

25\. If one marries either knowingly or unknowingly a pregnant bride,
the child which is born of her is called (a son) taken with the bride
(saho*dh*a). <span id="fr_1129"></span>[25](#fn_1129.md)

26\. He (is called a son) bought (krîta) who, being purchased from his
father and his mother, or from either of them, is received in the place
of a child. <span id="fr_1130"></span>[26](#fn_1130.md)

27\. He (is called the son) of a twice-married woman (paunarbhava) who
is born of a re-married female, (i.e.) of one who, having left an
impotent man, has taken a second husband. <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[27](#fn_1131.md)

28\. He (is called) a self-given (son, svaya*m*datta) who, abandoned by
his father and his mother, gives himself (to a stranger). <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[28](#fn_1132.md)

29\. He who is begotten by (a man of) the first twice-born (caste) on a
female of the *S*ûdra caste (is called) a Nishâda.

30\. (He who was begotten by the same parents) through lust (is called)
a Pâra*s*ava. Thus (the various kinds of) sons (have been
enumerated). <span id="fr_1133"></span>[30](#fn_1133.md)

31\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'They declare the
legitimate son, the son of an appointed daughter, the son begotten on a
wife, the adopted son and the son made, the son born secretly and the
son cast off, (to be entitled) to share the inheritance.' <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[31](#fn_1134.md)

32\. 'They declare the son of an unmarried damsel and the son received
with the bride, the son bought, <span id="fr_1135"></span>[32](#fn_1135.md)

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

likewise the son of a twice-married female, the son self-given and the
Nishâda, to be members of the family.'

33\. Aupa*g*andhani (declares that) the first among them alone (is
entitled to inherit, and a member of his father's family). <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[33](#fn_1136.md)

34\. 'Now, O *G*anaka, I jealously watch my wives, (though I did) not
(do it) formerly; for they have declared in Yama's court that the son
belongs to the begetter. The giver of the seed carries off the son,
after death, in Yama's hall, Therefore they carefully protect their
wives, fearing the seed of strangers.'

35\. 'Carefully watch (the procreation of your) offspring, lest strange
seed fall on your soil. After death the son belongs to the begetter;
through carelessness a husband makes (the procreation of) a son
useless.'

36\. Let them carefully protect the shares of <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[36](#fn_1137.md)

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

those who are minors, as well as the increments (thereon).

37\. Granting food, clothes, (and shelter), they shall support those who
are incapable of transacting legal business, <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[37](#fn_1138.md)

38\. (Viz.) the blind, idiots, those immersed in vice, the incurably
diseased, and so forth, <span id="fr_1139"></span>[38](#fn_1139.md)

39\. Those who neglect their duties and occupations; <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[39](#fn_1140.md)

40\. But not the outcast nor his offspring. <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[40](#fn_1141.md)

41\. Intercourse with outcasts shall not take place.

42\. But he shall support an outcast mother, without speaking to her.

43\. The daughters shall obtain the ornaments of their mother, (as many
as are) presented according to the custom (of the caste), or anything
else (that may be given according to custom). <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[43](#fn_1142.md)

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

44\. Women do not possess independence. <span
id="fr_1143"></span>[44](#fn_1143.md)

45\. Now they quote also (the following verse): Their father protects
(them) in childhood, their husband protects (them) in youth, and their
sons protect (them) in old age a woman is never fit for
independence.' <span id="fr_1144"></span>[45](#fn_1144.md)

46\. The Veda declares, 'Therefore women are considered to be destitute
of strength and of a portion.' <span id="fr_1145"></span>[46](#fn_1145.md)

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

47\. Those (women) who strive (to do what is) agreeable to their
husbands will gain heaven. <span id="fr_1146"></span>[47](#fn_1146.md)

48\. But for a violation (of their duty towards the husband) a
K*rikkh*ra penance (must be performed). <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[48](#fn_1147.md)

49\. (For violating it) with a *S*ûdra (a woman) shall perform a lunar
penance (*k*ândrâya*n*a);

50\. (For violating it) against the order of the castes with a Vai*s*ya
and so forth, she shall perform a K*rikkh*ra or an (Atik*rikkh*ra)
penance.

51\. For male (offenders, i.e.) Brâhma*n*as and so forth, a year's
chastity (is prescribed). <span id="fr_1148"></span>[51](#fn_1148.md)

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

52\. Let him burn a *S*ûdra (who commits adultery with an Âryan) in a
straw-fire. <span id="fr_1149"></span>[52](#fn_1149.md)

53\. Now they quote also (the following verses):

Sûtra. Govinda agrees with *G*îmûtavâhana.

<span id="fn_1115"></span>[225:9](sbe1457.htm#fr_1115.md) Colebrooke V,
Dig. XLIX. The rule is an explanation of the term vara*m* rûpam, 'the
most excellent chattel,' in Sûtra 4. The meaning probably is, as the
Digest states, that among Brâhma*n*as it is usual to give to the eldest
a bull, among Kshatriyas a horse, and so forth.

caste obtain a third of the estate when a legitimate son of the body is
born to their father; see also Kâtyâyana V, Dig. CCXVIII. Govinda gives
the following explanation: aurasa*h* savar*n*aputrâ*s* *k*a vakshyante

and making one of them sixteen (?), he shall give three, two,

Aupa*g*andhani is one of the ancient teachers of the White Ya*g*ur-veda,
mentioned in the lists incorporated in the *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a XIV,
5, 5, 21; 7, 3, 26. The legends of the White Ya*g*ur-veda frequently
mention king *G*anaka of Videha, and assert that that philosopher king
had frequent and intimate intercourse with Yâ*gñ*avalkya and other
teachers of the Veda which Âditya revealed. It seems to me, therefore,
highly probable that Govinda is right in taking the vocative *g*anaka in
Sûtra 34 as a proper name, and in asserting that the verse belongs to a
conversation between Aupa*g*andhani and *G*anaka. This explanation,
which possibly may be based on an ancient tradition of Baudhâyana's
school, is certainly preferable to Haradatta's statement on Âpastamba
II, 6, 13, 7, that these verses express the sentiments of a husband who
had neglected to watch his wives, and later learned that he would not
derive any spiritual benefit from their offspring. In the text of Sûtra
34 I read with the Dekhan MSS. and Âpastamba, loc. cit., îrshyâmi,
instead of ishyâmi, which M. and the commentary give.

<span id="fn_1137"></span>[229:36](sbe1457.htm#fr_1137.md) Colebrooke V,

minors shall bear interest,'--Govinda.

may also mean 'afflicted by calamities,' and is perhaps intended to be
taken both ways.

qualifies (the word) ornaments; sâmpradâyikam (means) what is obtained
according to custom; what is given to their mother by the maternal
grandfather and grandmother, that (is called) sâmpradâyikam. "Or
anything else," (viz.) presented according to custom, (e.g.) a bedstead
and the <span id="page_231">p. 231</span> like, a couch, and an outer
garment, and the like. So much and nothing else shall the daughters
receive.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[231:44](sbe1457.htm#fr_1143.md) Vasish*th*a V,
s. All the MSS. of the text read na strîsvâtantrya*m* vidyate, while the
text given by the two copies of the commentary has na strî svâtantrya*m*
vindate. Govinda asserts that the Sûtra is intended to forbid the
independent action of women with respect to things inherited. The
correct view probably is that with this Sûtra the topic of the duties
and rights of women begins, and that the rule contains a general maxim.

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[231:45](sbe1457.htm#fr_1144.md) Vasish*th*a V,
2.

<span id="fn_1145"></span>[231:46](sbe1457.htm#fr_1145.md) Colebrooke V,
Dig. CXXXI. The text is in great confusion. The Dekhan and Gu*g*arât
MSS., except K., read, na dâya*m* nirindriyâ hyadâyâ*s* *k*a striyo matâ
iti sruti*h*; K. has, tasmât\[n\]nirindriyâ hy. st. m. i. *s*ru. \|\|
tasmât striyo nirindriyâ adâyâdîr api pâpât; while M. and the I. O. copy
of the commentary have, tasmânnirindriyâ adâyâ*s* *k*a striyo matâ iti
*s*ruti*h* \[sûti*h*, M.\] The Telugu copy is mutilated, and reads
nâdayantiriti sruti*h*. Though the reading of the Dekhan MSS. is
supported by Mitrami*s*ra Vîramitrodaya, fol. 209, p. I, 1. 3, it is
certainly not the original one, for there is no verb by which the
accusative 'dâyam' is governed. Mitrami*s*ra's attempt to make it depend
on 'arhati' in the verse quoted in Sûtra 45 is futile, because,
according to the usage of the Sûtrakâras, a Sûtra may be completed by a
verb taken frost another original aphorism of the author, but cannot be
connecter with a portion of a quotation taken from some other work. This
same principle, of course, applies not only to Sûtras, but to the
writings of all other authors, whether Indian or European. The reading
of K., M., and of the I. O. copy of the commentary is not open to the
objection just mentioned, and therefore preferable. But it seems to me
highly probable that, nevertheless, it is not <span id="page_232">p.
232</span> quite genuine; for the word 'tasmât,' with which it begins,
is not required, because its sense is already expressed by the following
hi,' and because the Sûtra apparently contains half an Anush*t*ubh
*S*loka, which the insertion of tasmât destroys. It is also easy to see
how it came to be inserted. Every Ya*g*urvedî who read the passage would
be reminded of the analogous passage of the Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ VI, 5,
8, 2, 'tasmât striyo nirindriyâ adâyâdîr api pâpât pu*m*sa*h*
upastitaram,' which in K. has actually been inserted after our Sûtra. In
the Vedic Mantra 'tasmât' is required, and is certainly the genuine
reading. Hence it seems to have been transferred into Baudhâyana's text,
possibly by the mistake of some scribe who, according to the habit of
his kind, took a marginal reference to the beginning of the Vedic
passage for a correction of the text. In my opinion it must be thrown
out. The sense of the half verse remains exactly the same. It
corresponds to Manu IX, 18. According to Govindasvâmin and others its
object is to show that women are incapable of inheriting, and the word
dâya, 'portion,' must be taken in the sense of 'a share of the
inheritance.' For a full discussion of this point, I refer to the
Introductory Note on Book I, Chapter II, Sect. 14 of West and Miller's
Digest of H. L. C., third edition.

<span id="fn_1148"></span>[232:51](sbe1457.htm#fr_1148.md) Govinda points
out that this rule refers to adultery with women of equal caste, and
thinks that the word 'chastity' indicates that K*rikkh*ra penances are
to be performed; Vasish*th*a XXI, 16, 17; Vish*n*u LIII, 2. But see
Gautama XXII, 29.
