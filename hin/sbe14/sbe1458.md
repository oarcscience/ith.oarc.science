### PRA*S*NA II, ADHYÂYA 2, KA*ND*IKÂ 4.

1\. 'Anybody but a Brâhma*n*a shall suffer corporal punishment for
adultery.' <span id="fr_1150"></span>[1](#fn_1150)

2\. 'The wives (of men) of all castes must be guarded more carefully
than wealth.' <span id="fr_1151"></span>[2](#fn_1151)

3\. 'But corporal punishment (shall) not (be inflicted) for (adultery
with) the wives of minstrels and with those who appear on the stage. For
(the husbands) carry them (to other men), or, lying concealed (at home),
permit them to hold culpable intercourse.' <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[3](#fn_1152)

4\. 'Women (possess) an unrivalled means of purification; they never
become (entirely) foul. For month by month their temporary uncleanness
removes their sins.' <span id="fr_1153"></span>[4](#fn_1153)

5\. 'Soma gave them cleanliness, the Gandharva their melodious voice,
and Fire purity of all (limbs); therefore women are free from
stains.' <span id="fr_1154"></span>[5](#fn_1154)

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

6\. 'Let him abandon a barren (wife) in the tenth year, one who bears
daughters (only) in the twelfth, one whose children (all) die in the
fifteenth, but her who is quarrelsome without delay.' <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[6](#fn_1155)

7\. A widow shall avoid during a year (the use of) honey, meat,
spirituous liquor, and salt, and sleep on the ground. <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[7](#fn_1156)

8\. Maudgalya (declares that she shall do so) during six months.

9\. After (the expiration of) that (time) she may, with the permission
of her Gurus, bear a son to her brother-in-law, in case she has no
son. <span id="fr_1157"></span>[9](#fn_1157)

10\. Now they quote also (the following verse): One whose appointment
can have no result, (viz.) a barren woman, one who has borne sons, one
who is past child-bearing, one whose children are (all) dead, and one
who is unwilling must not be appointed.' <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[10](#fn_1158)

11\. The sister of a maternal uncle and of the father, a sister, a
sister's daughter, a daughter-in-law, a maternal uncle's wife, and the
wife of a <span id="fr_1159"></span>[11](#fn_1159)

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

friend are females who must never be approached (agamyâ).

12\. For intercourse with females who must not be approached (agamyâ), a
K*rikkh*ra and an Atik*rikkh*ra (and) a *K*ândrâya*n*a are the penances
prescribed for all.

13\. Thereby (the rule regarding) intercourse with a female of the
*K*a*nd*âla caste has been declared. <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[13](#fn_1160)

14\. Now they quote also (the following verses): A Brâhma*n*a who
unintentionally approaches a female of the *K*a*nd*âla caste, eats (food
given by a *K*a*nd*âla) or receives (presents from him), becomes an
outcast; but (if he does it) intentionally, he becomes equal (to a
*K*a*nd*âla). <span id="fr_1161"></span>[14](#fn_1161)

15\. 'He who approaches his father's, his teacher's, or a king's wife,
is guilty of the crime of violating a Guru's bed; the penance ordained
for him has been declared above.' <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[15](#fn_1162)

16\. (A Brâhma*n*a) who is unable (to subsist) by teaching, sacrificing
for others, or the acceptance of gifts, shall maintain himself by
following the duties of Kshatriyas, because that is the next following
(caste). <span id="fr_1163"></span>[16](#fn_1163)

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

17\. Gautama (declares that one shall) not (act thus). For the duties of
Kshatriyas are too cruel for a Brâhma*n*a. <span
id="fr_1164"></span>[17](#fn_1164)

18\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Out of regard for the
sacred law a Brâhma*n*a and a Vai*s*ya may take up arms for (the
protection of) cows or Brâhma*n*as, or when a confusion of the castes
(threatens to take place). <span id="fr_1165"></span>[18](#fn_1165)

19\. (Or) the livelihood of a Vai*s*ya should be adopted, because that
is the one following (next): <span id="fr_1166"></span>[19](#fn_1166)

20\. (If he lives by agriculture) he shall plough before
breakfast, <span id="fr_1167"></span>[20](#fn_1167)

21\. With two bulls whose noses have not been pierced, not striking them
with the goad, (but) frequently coaxing them.

22\. The (sacred domestic) fire (shall be kindled) at the wedding; the
religious ceremonies up to the Agnyâdheya (shall be) performed in
that. <span id="fr_1168"></span>[22](#fn_1168)

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

23\. Now, beginning with the Agnyâdheya, follow these (rites in an)
uninterrupted (series), as, for instance, the Agnyâdheya, the Agnihotra,
the new and full moon sacrifices, the Âgraya.a at the winter and summer
solstices, the animal sacrifice, the *K*âturmâsyas at the beginning of
each season, the Sha*ddh*ot*ri* in spring, the Agnish*t*oma. Thus the
attainment of bliss (is secured). <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[23](#fn_1169)

24\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Neither he who is
accustomed to sleep in the day-time, nor he who eats the food of
anybody, nor he who falls from a height to which he has climbed, can
reach heaven as he desires.' <span id="fr_1170"></span>[24](#fn_1170)

25\. Let him avoid meanness, hard-heartedness, and crookedness. <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[25](#fn_1171)

26\. Now they quote also with reference to this (subject the following)
verse in the dialogue between the daughters of U*s*anas and
V*ri*shaparvan: 'Thou, forsooth, art the daughter of one who praises
(others), who begs and accepts (gifts); but I am the child of one who is
praised, who gives gifts and does not accept them.' <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[26](#fn_1172)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1150"></span>[233:1](sbe1458.htm#fr_1150) **4**. Âpastamba
II, 10, 26, 20; 10, 27, 11. Govinda thinks that non-Brâhmanical
offenders should be burned, in accordance with Vasish*th*a XXI, 2-3. But
mutilation may also be intended. Sa*m*graha*n*a, 'adultery,' probably
includes all those acts mentioned Manu VIII, 354-358.

<span id="fn_1151"></span>[233:2](sbe1458.htm#fr_1151) Manu VIII, 359.

<span id="fn_1152"></span>[233:3](sbe1458.htm#fr_1152) Manu VIII, 362. I
read conjecturally, 'sa*m*sar*g*ayanti tâ hyetâ niguptâ*s*
*k*âlayantyapi,' basing my emendations on Manu's text. The MSS. and
Govinda have, sa*m*sar*g*ayanti tâ hyetân niguptâ*ms* *k*âlayanty api,
which gives no good sense. Govinda explains *k*âra*n*adârâ*h*, 'the
wives of minstrels,' by devadâsya*h*, 'temple-slaves.'

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[233:4](sbe1458.htm#fr_1153) Vasish*th*a
XXVIII, 4.

<span id="fn_1154"></span>[233:5](sbe1458.htm#fr_1154) Vasish*th*a
XXVIII, 6.

<span id="fn_1155"></span>[234:6](sbe1458.htm#fr_1155) Manu IX, 81.

<span id="fn_1156"></span>[234:7](sbe1458.htm#fr_1156)-8. Vasish*th*a
XVII, 55. The word madya, 'spirituous liquor,' occurs in M. and the I.
O. copy of the commentary. The MSS. from the Dekhan and Gu*g*arât,
including K., read ma*gg*ana or ma*dd*âna, the compound letter being
very indistinct.

<span id="fn_1157"></span>[234:9](sbe1458.htm#fr_1157) Vasish*th*a XVII,
56, where the term 'Gurus' is fully explained.

<span id="fn_1158"></span>[234:10](sbe1458.htm#fr_1158) Vasish*th*a
XVII, 57-59. M. and the two copies of the commentary read
pi*s*â*k*otpannaputrâ *k*a instead of vasâ *k*otpannaputrâ *k*a, 'a
barren woman and one who has borne sons.' I follow the Dekhan and
Gu*g*arât MSS., which undoubtedly give the genuine reading. Perhaps the
term ava*s*âm, Vasish*th*a XVII, 57, should be corrected to va*s*âm.

<span id="fn_1159"></span>[234:11](sbe1458.htm#fr_1159)-12. These two
Sûtras are additions to II, 1, 2, 13. See also Nârada XII, 73-74;
Vasish*th*a XXI, 16.

<span id="fn_1160"></span>[235:13](sbe1458.htm#fr_1160) Vasish*th*a
XXIII, 41; Vish*n*u LIII, 5-6.

<span id="fn_1161"></span>[235:14](sbe1458.htm#fr_1161) Manu XI, 176.

<span id="fn_1162"></span>[235:15](sbe1458.htm#fr_1162) Govinda thinks
that the penance intended is that mentioned in Sûtra 12. Probably a
severer one is meant. The verse is interesting, as it clearly is a
quotation from some metrical work on law, not merely of traditional
detached *s*lokas.

<span id="fn_1163"></span>[235:16](sbe1458.htm#fr_1163) Vasish*th*a II,
22. The Sûtra 'adhyâpanayâ*g*anapratigrahair a*s*akta*h*
kshatradharme*n*a *g*îvet pratyanantaratvât' occurs in the two copies of
the commentary only. The I. O. copy of the commentary has, however,
before it the following words: \[dharmya\] svâdhyâyaprava*k*ane evety
adhikânâ*m* \[kâra*m*\] dar*s*ayati pratig*ri*hîtâ tâd*ri*k
pratigrahîtâra*m* g*ri*dhnuvanti \[târa *ri*dhnu°\] *ri*tvigya*g*amânâ
yâ*g*inau <span id="page_236">p. 236</span>\[°*g*ane\] tada*s*aktau
kshatradharmau. M. reads, dharmanasvâdhyâyaprava*k*ana \[ne\]
ityadhikâra*n* dar*s*ayati pratigrahîtâd*ri*k pratigrahîtâra
*ri*dhnuvanti *ri*tvigya*g*amâna yâ*g*anau tada*s*aktau svâdhyâyadhyâ
\[°yâdhya\] panaya*gñ*ayâ*g*anapratigrahair a*s*aktama \[ta*h*\]
kshatradharmme*n*a gîvet. The Dekhan and Gu*g*arât MSS. read, dhârmye
svâdhyâyaprava*k*ane ityadhikâra*m* dar*s*ayati \| pratigrahe dâtâ
pratigrahîtâ\[ra\] *ri*dhnuvanti \| *ri*tvigya*g*amânâ yâ*g*ane \|
tada*s*aktau kshatradharme*n*a *g*îvayet, or have corruptions of this
passage. I cannot come to any other conclusion than that the passage
which precedes the words translated by me are a very ancient
interpolation, caused by the embodiment of a portion of an old Bhâshya
with the text, and that all our MSS., however much they may differ, go
back to one codex archetypus.

<span id="fn_1164"></span>[236:17](sbe1458.htm#fr_1164) Gautama
Introduction, p. lii.

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[236:18](sbe1458.htm#fr_1165) Gautama VII, 25.

<span id="fn_1166"></span>[236:19](sbe1458.htm#fr_1166) Vasish*th*a II,
24.

<span id="fn_1167"></span>[236:20](sbe1458.htm#fr_1167)-21. Vasish*th*a
II, 32.

<span id="fn_1168"></span>[236:22](sbe1458.htm#fr_1168) Vasish*th*a
VIII, 3. The religious ceremonies to be performed with the sacred
domestic fire, which, according to Baudhâyana, <span id="page_237">p.
237</span> should be kindled at the wedding, not on the division of the
paternal estate (Gautama V, q), are the so-called G*ri*hya ceremonies
(Gautama V, 8-9).

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[237:23](sbe1458.htm#fr_1169) Vasish*th*a XI,
46. The sacrifices enumerated in this Sûtra require three fires, and
belong to the *s*rauta or vaitânika ya*gñ*as. The Sha*ddh*ot*ri*
mentioned here seems to be the animal sacrifice mentioned in the
commentary on Kâtyâyana *S*rauta-sûtra VI, 1, 36.

<span id="fn_1170"></span>[237:24](sbe1458.htm#fr_1170) An
ârû*dh*apatita, 'he who falls from a height to which he has climbed,'
is, according to Govinda, an ascetic who slides back into civil life.

<span id="fn_1171"></span>[237:25](sbe1458.htm#fr_1171) Vasish*th*a VI,
40; X, 30. Govinda explains *s*â*th*yam, 'hard-heartedness,' by *s*aktau
satyâm api paropakârâ*k*ara*n*am, 'not doing a kindness to others though
one is able to do so.'

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[237:26](sbe1458.htm#fr_1172) The dialogue
mentioned is that between *S*armish*th*â and <span id="page_238">p.
238</span> Devayânî, which occurs Mahâbhârata I, 78. The verse quoted is
the tenth of that Adhyâya, and agrees with ours, except that sutâham is
read for athâham in the beginning of the second half verse.
