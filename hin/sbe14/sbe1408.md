### CHAPTER V.

1\. A woman is not independent, the males are her masters. It has been
declared in the Veda, 'A female who neither goes naked nor is
temporarily unclean is paradise.' <span id="fr_189"></span>[1](#fn_189)

2\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Their fathers protect
them in childhood, their husbands protect them in youth, and their sons
protect them in age; a woman is never fit for independence.' <span
id="fr_190"></span>[2](#fn_190)

3\. The penance (to be performed) by a (wife) for being unfaithful to
her husband has been declared in the (section on) secret penances. <span
id="fr_191"></span>[3](#fn_191)

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

4\. For month by month the menstrual excretion takes away her
sins. <span id="fr_192"></span>[4](#fn_192)

5\. A woman in her courses is impure during three (days and)
nights. <span id="fr_193"></span>[5](#fn_193)

6\. (During that period) she shall not apply collyrium to her eyes, nor
anoint (her body), nor bathe in water; she shall sleep on the ground;
she shall not sleep in the day-time, nor touch the fire, nor make a
rope, nor clean her teeth, nor eat meat, nor look at the planets, nor
smile, nor busy herself with (house-hold affairs), nor run; she shall
drink out of a large vessel, or out of her joined hands, or out of a
copper vessel. <span id="fr_194"></span>[6](#fn_194)

7\. For it has been declared in the Veda, 'When Indra had slain
(V*ri*tra) the three-headed son of Tvash*tri*, he was seized by Sin, and
he considered himself to be tainted with exceedingly great guilt. All
beings cried out against him (saying to him), <span
id="fr_195"></span>[7](#fn_195)

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

\[paragraph continues\] 'O thou slayer of a learned Brâhma*n*a! O thou
slayer of a learned Brâhma*n*a!' He ran to the women for protection (and
said to them), 'Take upon yourselves the third part of this my guilt
(caused by) the murder of a learned Brâhma*n*a.' They answered, ''What
shall we have (for doing thy wish)?' He replied, 'Choose a boon.' They
said, 'Let us obtain offspring (if our husbands approach us) during the
proper season, at pleasure let us dwell (with our husbands until (our
children) are born.' He answered, 'So be it.' (Then) they took upon
themselves (the third part of his guilt). That guilt of
Brâhma*n*a-murder appears every month as the menstrual flow. Therefore
let him not eat the food of a woman in her courses; (for) such a one has
put on the shape of the guilt of Brâhma*n*a-murder.

8\. (Those who recite the Veda) proclaim the following (rule):
'Collyrium and ointment must not be accepted from her; for that is the
food of women. Therefore they feel a loathing for her (while she is) in
that (condition, saying), "She shall not approach."' <span
id="fr_196"></span>[8](#fn_196)

9\. 'Those (Brâhma*n*as in) whose (houses) menstruating women sit, those
who keep no sacred fire, <span id="fr_197"></span>[9](#fn_197)

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

and those in whose family there is no *S*rotriya; all these are equal to
*S*ûdras.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_189"></span>[31:1](sbe1408.htm#fr_189) **V**. Vish*n*u XXV,
12. The second clause ought to have been given as a separate Sûtra. 'A
female who no longer goes naked,' i.e. one who has reached the age of
puberty. Am*ri*tam, 'is paradise,' i.e. procures bliss in this life and
heaven after death through her children.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[31:2](sbe1408.htm#fr_190) Vish*n*u XXV, 13.
Identical with Manu IX, 3.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[31:3](sbe1408.htm#fr_191) 'The penance which
has been ordained in case a wife is unfaithful to her husband, i.e. goes
to a lover and so forth, must be performed in secret, i.e. in solitary
places.'--K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita. The explanation is clearly erroneous.
Rahasyeshu cannot mean 'in secret' or 'in secret places.' It might refer
either to a. work or works called Rahasyâni or to the rahasyâni
prâya*sk*ittâni. As <span id="page_32">p. 32</span> the next Sûtra
contains a half-verse taken from the section on secret penances, XXVIII,
4, it is evident that Vasish*th*a here makes a cross-reference. Similar
cross-references occur further on.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[32:4](sbe1408.htm#fr_192) Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 72,
and below, XXVIII, 4.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[32:5](sbe1408.htm#fr_193) Vish*n*u XXII, 72.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[32:6](sbe1408.htm#fr_194) Taitt. Sa*m*h. II,
5, I, 6-7. I read with the majority of the MSS., grahânna nirîksheta
instead of g*ri*hân na niriksheta, which latter phrase
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita renders by 'she shall not look out of the house.'
My reading is confirmed by his quotation from the Sm*ri*tima*ñg*arî,
where grahâ*n*â*m* nirîksha*n*am, 'looking at the planets, i.e. the sun,
moon,' &c., is forbidden. 'A large vessel,' i.e. an earthen
jar.--K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[32:7](sbe1408.htm#fr_195) Taitt. Sarah. II, 5,
I, 2-5. The name 'slayer of a learned Brâhma*n*a' is applied to Indra,
because V*ri*tra is said to have been deeply versed in the Vedas.
Regarding the 'proper season of women,' see Manu III, 46-48. In the
clause 'That guilt of Brâhma*n*a-murder appears,' &c., I read âvir
bhavati with the majority of the MSS. For the prohibition to accept food
from a-ra*g*asvalâ, see Vish*n*u LI, 16-17.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[33:8](sbe1408.htm#fr_196) Taitt. Sarah. II, 5,
1, 6. I read the text of this Sûtra as follows:
'Tadâhu*h*--a*ñg*anâbhya*ñg*anam evâsyâ na pratigrâhya*m* taddhi striyâ
annam iti--tasmât tasyai *k*a tatra *k*a bîbhatsante meyam upâgâd iti.'
The MSS. give the following readings in the second clause: tasmât tasmai
*k*a (B. Bh. E. F,), tatra na (F.), medhamupâgâd (Bh. F.), medha upâgâd
(E.), seyamupâgâd (B.) K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita follows as usually MS. B.
His explanation of the whole Sûtra is erroneous. 'That is the food of
women,' i.e. that is as necessary to women as their food, because to
beautify themselves is one of their duties.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[33:9](sbe1408.htm#fr_197) The meaning of the
Sûtra is that a Brâhmanical beggar must not accept any alms from
Brâhma*n*as whose wives are in their <span id="page_34">p. 34</span>
courses, who keep no sacred fire, and do not attend to the duty of
Veda-study. Regarding sinners of the latter two kinds, see also
Âpastamba I, 6, 18, 32-33.
