### PRA*S*NA I, ADHYÂYA 11, KA*ND*IKÂ 21.

1\. The Veda declares, The quality of the offspring depends on the
quality of the marriage rite.' <span id="fr_1030"></span>[1](#fn_1030)

2\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'It is declared that a
female who has been purchased for money is not a wife. She cannot
(assist) at sacrifices offered to the gods or the manes. Kâ*s*yapa has
stated that she is a slave.' <span id="fr_1031"></span>[2](#fn_1031)

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

3\. 'Those wicked men who, seduced by greed, give away a daughter for a
fee, who (thus) sell themselves and commit a great crime, fall (after
death) into a dreadful place of punishment and destroy their family down
to the seventh (generation). Moreover they will repeatedly die and be
born again. All (this) is declared (to happen), if a fee (is taken).'

4\. On the day of the full moon, on the eighth day (of each half month),
on the day of the new moon, on the appearance of a meteor, on the
occasion of an earthquake, on visiting a burial-ground, and on the death
of the king of the country, of a *S*rotriya or of one who has the same
Guru (satîrthya), the study of the Veda must be discontinued for a day
and a night. <span id="fr_1032"></span>[4](#fn_1032)

5\. (The study of the Veda must be interrupted) while (a strong) wind
(blows), a foul smell (is perceptible), or hoar-frost (lies on the
ground), when dancing (is going on), and while the sounds of singing,
musical instruments, weeping, or of the Sâman (melodies are
audible). <span id="fr_1033"></span>[5](#fn_1033)

6\. When thunder, lightning, and rain come together, (the interruption
shall last) three days except in the rainy season. <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[6](#fn_1034)

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

7\. In the rainy season, too, (the reading must be interrupted) until
the same hour of the (next) day or night, (if thunder and lightning come
together), not on account of rain. <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[7](#fn_1035)

8\. If (he has) received anything or dined on the occasion of a
sacrifice in honour of the manes, (he shall not read) during the
remainder of the day, <span id="fr_1036"></span>[8](#fn_1036)

9\. (Nor) after meals until (the food) has been digested. <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[9](#fn_1037)

10\. For the hand of a Brâhma*n*a is his mouth. <span
id="fr_1038"></span>[10](#fn_1038)

11\. Now they quote also (the following verse): According to the
revealed texts there is no difference whether one has eaten or received
(a present at a *S*râddha).'

12\. (A student shall discontinue the study of the Veda) during three
days in case his father has died. <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[12](#fn_1039)

13\. 'Of two kinds, forsooth, is the virile energy of a famous
Brâhma*n*a who is learned in the Vedas, (that which resides) above the
navel and the other (that resides) below the' navel. Through that
which <span id="fr_1040"></span>[13](#fn_1040)

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

(resides) above the navel, his offspring is produced when he initiates
Brâhma*n*as, when he teaches them, when he causes them to offer
sacrifices, when he makes them holy. All these are his children. But
through that which resides below the navel the children of his body are
produced. Therefore they never say to a *S*rotriya who is versed in the
Vedas, 'Thou art destitute of offspring.'

14\. 'Therefore a Brâhma*n*a has two names, two mouths, two kinds of
virile energy, and two births.'

15\. (Let him discontinue the recitation of the Veda) as long as he is
within hearing or sight of *S*ûdras and Apapâtras. <span
id="fr_1041"></span>[15](#fn_1041)

16\. When at night the howl of a solitary jackal is heard, he shall not
study until he has slept. <span id="fr_1042"></span>[16](#fn_1042)

17\. Let him not study in the evening and morning twilights nor on the
Parva-days. <span id="fr_1043"></span>[17](#fn_1043)

18\. He shall not eat meat nor approach his wife (on those days). <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[18](#fn_1044)

19\. It is declared in the Veda, 'For on the Parva-days the Râkshasas
and the Pi*s*â*k*as roam about (in order to injure men).'

20\. And on (the appearance of) other omens and portents (he shall not
repeat the Veda), except mentally, during a day and a night.

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

21\. The mental recitation of the Veda must also be interrupted on
births and deaths (occurring in the family).

22\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The eighth day destroys
the teacher, the fourteenth destroys the pupil, the fifteenth destroys
learning; therefore let him avoid (studying the Veda) on the
Parva-days.' <span id="fr_1045"></span>[22](#fn_1045)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1030"></span>[207:1](sbe1454.htm#fr_1030) **21**. Âpastamba
II, 5, 12, 4.

<span id="fn_1031"></span>[207:2](sbe1454.htm#fr_1031) Vasish*th*a I,
36-38. Govinda inserts after the words 'Now they quote also,' two Sûtras
in prose: 1. 'Ten virtuous sons and daughters (spring) from a Daiva
marriage, ten from a Prâ*g*âpatya marriage. It is declared in the Veda
that the son of a wife wedded according to the Brâhma rite (sanctifies)
ten ancestors, ten descendants, and oneself.' 2. 'The power of learning
the Veda also <span id="page_208">p. 208</span> belongs to such sons.'
None of my MSS. of the text has these words, and they are suspicious,
because the phrase 'Now they quote also' usually precedes verses only.
The Dekhan and Gu*g*arât MSS., except K., omit these and the next Sûtra
too.

<span id="fn_1032"></span>[208:4](sbe1454.htm#fr_1032) Vasish*th*a XIII,
22, 32-35; Vish*n*u XXX, 23. Govinda explains agnyutpâta, 'on the
appearance of meteor,' by 'if a fire breaks out in the village.'

<span id="fn_1033"></span>[208:5](sbe1454.htm#fr_1033) Vasish*th*a XIII,
17, 30; Vish*n*u XXX, 7, 13; Âpastamba I, 3, 11, 31; I, 3, 10, 17.

<span id="fn_1034"></span>[208:6](sbe1454.htm#fr_1034) Gautama XVI, 41.

<span id="fn_1035"></span>[209:7](sbe1454.htm#fr_1035) Govinda takes
ahorâtrayo*s* *k*a tatkâlam to mean until the end of the day or night.

<span id="fn_1036"></span>[209:8](sbe1454.htm#fr_1036) Vasish*th*a XIII,
15. Govinda adds that the recitation must be stopped as soon as the
invitation to a *S*râddha is received.

<span id="fn_1037"></span>[209:9](sbe1454.htm#fr_1037) Vasish*th*a XIII,
31.

<span id="fn_1038"></span>[209:10](sbe1454.htm#fr_1038) Vasish*th*a
XIII, 16. The word 'for' used in this Sûtra gives the reason for the
rule in Sûtra 8.

<span id="fn_1039"></span>[209:12](sbe1454.htm#fr_1039) 'This (rule)
refers to a student who has not returned home. But on one who has
returned home it is obligatory to interrupt the Veda-study until he
becomes pure. Here he calls the sub-teacher (upâdhyâya) "father,"
because he gives the Veda. For (an interruption of) twelve days'
duration is prescribed on (the death of) a real father (by the Sûtra);
"on the death of the mother, the father, and the teacher twelve
days."'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1040"></span>[209:13](sbe1454.htm#fr_1040) Vasish*th*a II,
5. This Sûtra is intended to show how the <span id="page_210">p.
210</span> Upâdhyâya can be called a father. Govinda states that the
precise meaning of anû*k*âna, 'versed or learned in the Veda,' is 'one
who knows the Veda, its meaning, and the Aṅgas: See also Baudhâyana
G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 10, 5.

<span id="fn_1041"></span>[210:15](sbe1454.htm#fr_1041) Vasish*th*a
XVIII, 12. Regarding the term Apapâtras, see Âpastamba I, 1, 3, 25 note.

<span id="fn_1042"></span>[210:16](sbe1454.htm#fr_1042) Âpastamba I, 3,
10, 17.

<span id="fn_1043"></span>[210:17](sbe1454.htm#fr_1043) Vasish*th*a
XIII, 22. The explanation of the term Parvaday is given below, Sûtra 22.

<span id="fn_1044"></span>[210:18](sbe1454.htm#fr_1044) Vish*n*u LXIX,
1.

<span id="fn_1045"></span>[211:22](sbe1454.htm#fr_1045) Vish*n*u XXX,
29-30. In accordance with the practice usual in Vedic works the best
MSS. of the text repeat the beginning of each Ka*nd*ikâ at the end of
the Pra*s*na, giving the last first.
