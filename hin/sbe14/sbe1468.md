### PRA*S*NA II, ADHYÂYA 8, KA*ND*IKÂ 14.

1\. The offering to the manes secures long life and heaven, is worthy of
praise and a rite ensuring prosperity. <span
id="fr_1272"></span>[1](#fn_1272.md)

2\. Persons who sanctify the company are, a Trimadhu, a Tri*n*â*k*iketa,
a Trisupar*n*a, one who keeps five fires, and one who knows the six
Aṅgas, one who performs the vow called *S*iras, one who knows the
Gyesh*th*asâman, (and) a Snâtaka; <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[2](#fn_1273.md)

3\. On failure of these, one who knows the (texts called) Rahasya. <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[3](#fn_1274.md)

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

4\. The *Ri*k-verses, the Ya*g*us-formulas, and the Sâmans (give) lustre
to a funeral offering. Therefore he may feed (on that occasion) even a
Sapi*nd*a relation who (knows) those (texts). <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[4](#fn_1275.md)

5\. Let him who feeds (Brâhma*n*as at a funeral sacrifice) cause them to
hear successively the Rakshoghna Sâmans, the Ya*g*us-formulas (called)
Svadhâvat, the *Ri*k-verses (called) Madhu, and the (texts called)
Pavitras. <span id="fr_1276"></span>[5](#fn_1276.md)

6\. Having invited on the day before (the *S*râddha), or just in the
morning, virtuous, pure (men), such as Trimadhus, who know the Vedâṅgas
and the sacred texts, who are not related by marriage, nor members of
the same family, nor connected through the Veda, at least three, (but
always) an odd number, the (sacrificer) makes them sit down on prepared
seats, covered with Darbha grass, facing the east or the north. <span
id="fr_1277"></span>[6](#fn_1277.md)

7\. Then he offers to them water mixed with sesamum seed, adorns them
with scents and garlands (and says), 'I wish to offer oblations in the
fire.' <span id="fr_1278"></span>[7](#fn_1278.md)

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

\[paragraph continues\] When he has received permission (to do so), he
heaps fuel on the sacred fire, scatters Ku*s*a grass around it, performs
(all the ceremonies) up to the end of the Agnimukha, and offers three
burnt oblations of food only, (reciting the following texts): 'To Soma,
accompanied by the manes, Svâhâ!' 'To Yama, accompanied by the Aṅgiras
and by the manes, Svâhâ!' 'To Agni, who carries the offerings to the
manes, who causes sacrifices to be well performed, Svâhâ!'

8\. He shall make these three oblations with food only which has been
sprinkled with the remainder of the (clarified butter). <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[8](#fn_1279.md)

9\. Let him give a cake of food to the birds.

10\. For it is declared in the Veda, 'The manes roam about in the shape
of birds.'

11\. Next he touches the (other food) with his hand and with the thumb,

12\. (And recites the following texts): 'Fire sees thee, who art
co-extensive with the earth, the *Ri*k-verses are thy greatness, lest
the gift be in vain; the earth is the vessel for thee, the sky the
cover; I offer thee in the mouth of Brahman, I offer thee in the Prâ*n*a
and the Apâna of learned Brâhma*n*as; thou art imperishable, mayest thou
never fail to (the manes of our) fathers yonder, in the other world.'
'Air hears thee, who art co-extensive with the middle sphere, <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[12](#fn_1280.md)

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

the Ya*g*us-formulas are thy greatness, lest the gift be in vain; the
earth is the vessel for thee, the sky the cover; . . . mayest thou never
fail to the (manes of our) grandfathers yonder, in the other world.'
'The sun reveals thee, who art co-extensive with the sky, the Sâmans are
thy greatness, lest the gift be in vain; . . . . mayest thou never fail
to the (manes of our) great-grandfathers yonder, in the other world.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1272"></span>[266:1](sbe1468.htm#fr_1272.md) **14**. Âpastamba
II, 7, 16, 1-2.

<span id="fn_1273"></span>[266:2](sbe1468.htm#fr_1273.md) Âpastamba II, 7,
17, 22; Vasish*th*a III, 19. Govinda states that the Atharvavedins know
the vow called *S*iras; see also Vasish*th*a XXVI, 12, and note.

<span id="fn_1274"></span>[266:3](sbe1468.htm#fr_1274.md) Govinda says that
persons acquainted with the Rahasyas or <span id="page_267">p.
267</span> Âra*n*yakas are preferable to those mentioned in the
preceding Sûtra, and thus the order must be reversed.

<span id="fn_1275"></span>[267:4](sbe1468.htm#fr_1275.md) Âpastamba II, 7,
17, 5.

<span id="fn_1276"></span>[267:5](sbe1468.htm#fr_1276.md) The texts on
which the Rakshoghna Sâmans are based occur Sâma-veda I, 1, 1, 3, 4--6;
the Svadhâvat Ya*g*us, Taitt. Brâhma*n*a I, 3, 10, 2; the Madhu *Rik*as,
Rig-veda I, 90, 6; and the three Pavitras, Taitt. Brâhma*n*a I, q, 8, 2.

<span id="fn_1277"></span>[267:6](sbe1468.htm#fr_1277.md) Âpastamba II, 7,
14, 5. All the MSS., including those of the commentary, read
yonigotramantrasambandhân instead of yonigotramantrâsambandhân. But the
explanation of gotrasambandhâ*h* by asagotrâ*h* shows still a faint
trace of the former existence of the reading which I have restored
conjecturally and translated. Its correctness is proved by the parallel
passage of Âpastamba.

<span id="fn_1278"></span>[267:7](sbe1468.htm#fr_1278.md) Vish*n*u LXXIII,
12--13; Manu III, 208-211. The Agnimukha <span id="page_268">p.
268</span> is a term denoting all the preliminaries which precede the
Pradhânahoma of a ceremony. The Dekhan and Gu*g*arât MSS. read â*g*yasya
instead of annasyaiva.

<span id="fn_1279"></span>[268:8](sbe1468.htm#fr_1279.md) Clarified butter
is necessary for the rites included in the Agnimukha.

<span id="fn_1280"></span>[268:12](sbe1468.htm#fr_1280.md) The Mantras are
addressed to the food which is to be offered.
