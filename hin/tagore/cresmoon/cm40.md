### MY SONG

This song of mine will wind its music around you, my child, like the
fond arms of love.

This song of mine will touch your forehead like a kiss of blessing.

When you are alone it will sit by your side and whisper in your ear,
when you are in the crowd it will fence you about with aloofness.

My song will be like a pair of wings to your dreams, it will transport
your heart to the verge of the unknown.

It will be like the faithful star overhead when dark night is over your
road.

My song will sit in the pupils of your eyes, and will carry your sight
into the heart of things.

And when my voice is silent in death, my song will speak in your living
heart.
