### BABY'S WAY

If baby only wanted to, he could fly up to heaven this moment.

It is not for nothing that he does not leave us.

He loves to rest his head on mother's bosom, and cannot ever bear to
lose sight of her.

Baby knows all manner of wise words, though few on earth can understand
their meaning.

It is not for nothing that he never wants to speak.

The one thing he wants is to learn mother's words from mother's lips.
That is why he looks so innocent.

Baby had a heap of gold and pearls, yet he came like a beggar on to this
earth.

It is not for nothing he came in such a disguise.

This dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly helpless, so
that he may beg for mother's wealth of love.

Baby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny crescent moon.

It was not for nothing he gave up his freedom.

He knows that there is room for endless joy in mother's little corner of
a heart, and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught and pressed in
her dear arms.

Baby never knew how to cry. He dwelt in the land of perfect bliss.

It is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears.

Though with the smile of his dear face he draws mother's yearning heart
to him, yet his little cries over tiny troubles weave the double bond of
pity and love.
