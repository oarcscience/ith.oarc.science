### THE ASTRONOMER

I only said, "When in the evening the round full moon gets entangled
among the branches of that *Kadam* tree, couldn't somebody catch it?"

But dâdâ \[*elder brother*\] laughed at me and said, "Baby, you are the
silliest child I have ever known. The moon is ever so far from us, how
could anybody catch it?"

I said, "Dâdâ how foolish you are! When mother looks out of her window
and smiles down at us playing, would you call her far away?"

Still said, "You are a stupid child! But, baby, where could you find a
net big enough to catch the moon with?"

I said, "Surely you could catch it with your hands."

But dâdâ laughed and said, "You are the silliest child I have known. If
it came nearer, you would see how big the moon is."

I said, "Dâdâ, what nonsense they teach at your school! When mother
bends her face down to kiss us does her face look very big?"

But still dâdâ says, "You are a stupid child."
