### THE LITTLE BIG MAN

I am small because I am a little child. I shall be big when I am as old
as my father is.

My teacher will come and say, "It is late, bring your slate and your
books."

I shall tell him, "Do you not know I am as big as father? And I must not
have lessons any more."

My master will wonder and say, "He can leave his books if he likes, for
he is grown up."

I shall dress myself and walk to the fair where the crowd is thick.

My uncle will come rushing up to me and say, "You will get lost, my boy;
let me carry you."

I shall answer, "Can't you see, uncle, I am as big as father. I must go
to the fair alone."

Uncle will say, "Yes, he can go wherever he likes, for he is grown up."

Mother will come from her bath when I am giving money to my nurse, for I
shall know how to open the box with my key.

Mother will say, "What are you about, naughty child?"

I shall tell her, "Mother, don't you know, I am as big as father, and I
must give silver to my nurse."

Mother will say to herself, "He can give money to whom he likes, for he
is grown up."

In the holiday time in October father will come home and, thinking that
I am still a baby, will bring for me from the town little shoes and
small silken frocks.

I shall say, "Father, give them to my dâdâ \[*elder brother*\], for I am
as big as you are."

Father will think and say, "He can buy his own clothes if he likes, for
he is grown up."
