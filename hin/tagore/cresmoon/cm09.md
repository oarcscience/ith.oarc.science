### THE BEGINNING

\[Illustration: From a drawing by Asit Kumar Haldar\]

"Where have I come from, where did you pick me up?" the baby asked its
mother.

She answered half crying, half laughing, and clasping the baby to her
breast,-- "You were hidden in my heart as its desire, my darling.

You were in the dolls of my childhood's games; and when with clay I made
the image of my god every morning, I made and unmade you then.

You were enshrined with our household deity, in his worship I worshipped
you.

In all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in the life of my mother you
have lived.

In the lap of the deathless Spirit who rules our home you have been
nursed for ages.

When in girlhood my heart was opening its petals, you hovered as a
fragrance about it.

Your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs, like a glow in the
sky before the sunrise.

Heaven's first darling, twin-born with the morning light, you have
floated down the stream of the world's life, and at last you have
stranded on my heart.

As I gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms me; you who belong to all
have become mine.

For fear of losing you I hold you tight to my breast. What magic has
snared the world's treasure in these slender arms of mine?"
