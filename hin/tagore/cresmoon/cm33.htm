<P>Mother, let us imagine we are travelling, and passing through a strange and dangerous country.</P>
<P>You are riding in a palanquin and I am trotting by you on a red horse.</P>
<P>It is evening and the sun goes down. The waste of <I>Joradighi</I> lies wan and grey before us. The land is desolate and barren.</P>
<P>You are frightened and thinking--"I know not where we have come to."</P>
<P>I say to you, "Mother, do not be afraid."</P>
<P>The meadow is prickly with spiky grass, and through it runs a narrow broken path.</P>
<P>There are no cattle to be seen in the wide field; they have gone to their village stalls.</P>
<P>It grows dark and dim on the land and sky, and we cannot tell where we are going.</P>
<P>Suddenly you call me and ask me in a whisper, "What light is that near the bank?"</P>
<P>Just then there bursts out a fearful yell, and figures come running towards us.</P>
<P>You sit crouched in your palanquin and repeat the names of the gods in prayer.</P>
<P>The bearers, shaking in terror, hide themselves in the thorny bush.</P>
<P>I shout to you, "Don't be afraid, mother. I am here."</P>
<P>With long sticks in their hands and hair all wild about their heads, they come nearer and nearer.</P>
<P>I shout, "Have a care! you villains! One step more and you are dead men."</P>
<P>They give another terrible yell and rush forward.</P>
<P>You clutch my hand and say, "Dear boy, for heaven's sake, keep away from them."</P>
<P>I say, "Mother, just you watch me."</P>
<P>Then I spur my horse for a wild gallop, and my sword and buckler clash against each other.</P>
<P>The fight becomes so fearful, mother, that it would give you a cold shudder could you see it from your palanquin.</P>
<P>Many of them fly, and a great number are cut to pieces.</P>
<P>I know you are thinking, sitting all by yourself, that your boy must be dead by this time.</P>
<P>But I come to you all stained with blood, and say, "Mother, the fight is over now."</P>
<P>You come out and kiss me, pressing me to your heart, and you say to yourself,</P>
<P>"I don't know what I should do if I hadn't my boy to escort me."</P>
<P>A thousand useless things happen day after day, and why couldn't such a thing come true by chance?</P>
<P>It would be like a story in a book.</P>
<P>My brother would say, "Is it possible? I always thought he was so delicate!"</P>
<P>Our village people would all say in amazement, "Was it not lucky that the boy was with his mother?"</P>
