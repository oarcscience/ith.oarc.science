<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE FIRST JASMINES</H3>
<P>Ah, these jasmines, these white jasmines!</P>
<P>I seem to remember the first day when I filled my hands with these jasmines, these white jasmines.</P>
<P>I have loved the sunlight, the sky and the green earth;</P>
<P>I have heard the liquid murmur of the river through the darkness of midnight;</P>
<P>Autumn sunsets have come to me at the bend of a road in the lonely waste, like a bride raising her veil to accept her lover.</P>
<P>Yet my memory is still sweet with the first white jasmines that I held in my hand when I was a child.</P>
<P>Many a glad day has come in my life, and I have laughed with merrymakers on festival nights.</P>
<P>On grey mornings of rain I have crooned many an idle song.</P>
<P>I have worn round my neck the evening wreath of <I>bakulas</I> woven by the hand of love.</P>
<P>Yet my heart is sweet with the memory of the first fresh jasmines that filled my hands when I was a child.</P>
