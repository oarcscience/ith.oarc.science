### DEFAMATION

Why are those tears in your eyes, my child?

How horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing?

You have stained your fingers and face with ink while writing--is that
why they call you dirty?

O, fie! Would they dare to call the full moon dirty because it has
smudged its face with ink?

For every little trifle they blame you, my child. They are ready to find
fault for nothing.

You tore your clothes while playing--is that why they call you untidy?

O, fie! What would they call an autumn morning that smiles through its
ragged clouds?

Take no heed of what they say to you, my child.

Take no heed of what they say to you, my child.

They make a long list of your misdeeds. Everybody knows how you love
sweet things--is that why they call you greedy?

O, fie! What then would they call us who love you?
