<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE CHAMPA FLOWER</H3>
<P>Supposing I became a <I>champa</I> flower, just for fun, and grew on a branch high up that tree, and shook in the wind with laughter and danced upon the newly budded leaves, would you know me, mother?</P>
<P>You would call, "Baby, where are you?" and I should laugh to myself and keep quite quiet.</P>
<P>I should slyly open my petals and watch you at your work.</P>
<P>When after your bath, with wet hair spread on your shoulders, you walked through the shadow of the <I>champa</I> tree to the little court where you say your prayers, you would notice the scent of the flower, but not know that it came from me.</P>
<P>When after the midday meal you sat at the window reading <I>Ramayana</I>, and the tree's shadow fell over your hair and your lap, I should fling my wee little shadow on to the page of your book, just where you were reading.</P>
<P>But would you guess that it was the tiny shadow of your little child?</P>
<P>When in the evening you went to the cow-shed with the lighted lamp in your hand, I should suddenly drop on to the earth again and be your own baby once more, and beg you to tell me a story.</P>
<P>"Where have you been, you naughty child?"</P>
<P>"I won't tell you, mother." That's what you and I would say then.</P>
