### THE FIRST JASMINES

Ah, these jasmines, these white jasmines!

I seem to remember the first day when I filled my hands with these
jasmines, these white jasmines.

I have loved the sunlight, the sky and the green earth;

I have heard the liquid murmur of the river through the darkness of
midnight;

Autumn sunsets have come to me at the bend of a road in the lonely
waste, like a bride raising her veil to accept her lover.

Yet my memory is still sweet with the first white jasmines that I held
in my hand when I was a child.

Many a glad day has come in my life, and I have laughed with merrymakers
on festival nights.

On grey mornings of rain I have crooned many an idle song.

I have worn round my neck the evening wreath of *bakulas* woven by the
hand of love.

Yet my heart is sweet with the memory of the first fresh jasmines that
filled my hands when I was a child.
