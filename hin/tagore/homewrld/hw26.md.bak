## Chapter Six

### Nikhil's Story

#### VIII

A few days later, my master brought Panchu round to me. His *zamindar*,
it appeared, had fined him a hundred rupees, and was threatening him
with ejectment.

"For what fault?" I enquired.

"Because," I was told, "he has been found selling foreign cloths. He
begged and prayed Harish Kundu, his *zamindar*, to let him sell off his
stock, bought with borrowed money, promising faithfully never to do it
again; but the *zamindar* would not hear of it, and insisted on his
burning the foreign stuff there and then, if he wanted to be let off.
Panchu in his desperation blurted out defiantly: "I can't afford it! You
are rich; why not buy it up and burn it?" This only made Harish Kundu
red in the face as he shouted: "The scoundrel must be taught manners,
give him a shoe-beating!" So poor Panchu got insulted as well as fined."

"What happened to the cloth?"

"The whole bale was burnt."

"Who else was there?"

"Any number of people, who all kept shouting *Bande Mataram*. Sandip was
also there. He took up some of the ashes, crying: 'Brothers! This is the
first funeral pyre lighted by your village in celebration of the last
rites of foreign commerce. These are sacred ashes. Smear yourselves with
them in token of your *Swadeshi* vow.'"

"Panchu," said I, turning to him, "you must lodge a complaint."

"No one will bear me witness," he replied.

"None bear witness?--Sandip! Sandip!"

Sandip came out of his room at my call. "What is the matter?" he asked.

"Won't you bear witness to the burning of this man's cloth?"

Sandip smiled. "Of course I shall be a witness in the case," he said.
"But I shall be on the opposite side."

"What do you mean," I exclaimed, "by being a witness on this or that
side? Will you not bear witness to the truth?"

"Is the thing which happens the only truth?"

"What other truths can there be?"

"The things that ought to happen! The truth we must build up will
require a great deal of untruth in the process. Those who have made
their way in the world have created truth, not blindly followed it."

"And so--"

"And so I will bear what you people are pleased to call false witness,
as they have done who have created empires, built up social systems,
founded religious organizations. Those who would rule do not dread
untruths; the shackles of truth are reserved for those who will fall
under their sway. Have you not read history? Do you not know that in the
immense cauldrons, where vast political developments are simmering,
untruths are the main ingredients?"

"Political cookery on a large scale is doubtless going on, but--"

"Oh, I know! You, of course, will never do any of the cooking. You
prefer to be one of those down whose throats the hotchpotch which is
being cooked will be crammed. They will partition Bengal and say it is
for your benefit. They will seal the doors of education and call it
raising the standard. But you will always remain good boys, snivelling
in your corners. We bad men, however, must see whether we cannot erect a
defensive fortification of untruth."

"It is no use arguing about these things, Nikhil," my master interposed.
"How can they who do not feel the truth within them, realize that to
bring it out from its obscurity into the light is man's highest aim--not
to keep on heaping material outside?"

Sandip laughed. "Right, sir!" said he. "Quite a correct speech for a
schoolmaster. That is the kind of stuff I have read in books; but in the
real world I have seen that man's chief business is the accumulation of
outside material. Those who are masters in the art, advertise the
biggest lies in their business, enter false accounts in their political
ledgers with their broadest-pointed pens, launch their newspapers daily
laden with untruths, and send preachers abroad to disseminate falsehood
like flies carrying pestilential germs. I am a humble follower of these
great ones. When I was attached to the Congress party I never hesitated
to dilute ten per cent of truth with ninety per cent of untruth. And
now, merely because I have ceased to belong to that party, I have not
forgotten the basic fact that man's goal is not truth but success."

"True success," corrected my master.

"Maybe," replied Sandip, "but the fruit of true success ripens only by
cultivating the field of untruth, after tearing up the soil and pounding
it into dust. Truth grows up by itself like weeds and thorns, and only
worms can expect to get fruit from it!" With this he flung out of the
room.

My master smiled as he looked towards me. "Do you know, Nikhil," he
said, "I believe Sandip is not irreligious--his religion is of the
obverse side of truth, like the dark moon, which is still a moon, for
all that its light has gone over to the wrong side."

"That is why," I assented, "I have always had an affection for him,
though we have never been able to agree. I cannot contemn him, even now;
though he has hurt me sorely, and may yet hurt me more."

"I have begun to realize that," said my master. "I have long wondered
how you could go on putting up with him. I have, at times, even
suspected you of weakness. I now see that though you two do not rhyme,
your rhythm is the same."

"Fate seems bent on writing *Paradise Lost* in blank verse, in my case,
and so has no use for a rhyming friend!" I remarked, pursuing his
conceit.

"But what of Panchu?" resumed my master.

"You say Harish Kundu wants to eject him from his ancestral holding.
Supposing I buy it up and then keep him on as my tenant?"

"And his fine?"

"How can the *zamindar* realize that if he becomes my tenant?"

"His burnt bale of cloth?"

"I will procure him another. I should like to see anyone interfering
with a tenant of mine, for trading as he pleases!"

"I am afraid, sir," interposed Panchu despondently, "while you big folk
are doing the fighting, the police and the law vultures will merrily
gather round, and the crowd will enjoy the fun, but when it comes to
getting killed, it will be the turn of only poor me!"

"Why, what harm can come to you?"

"They will burn down my house, sir, children and all!"

"Very well, I will take charge of your children," said my master. "You
may go on with any trade you like. They shan't touch you."

That very day I bought up Panchu's holding and entered into formal
possession. Then the trouble began.

Panchu had inherited the holding of his grandfather as his sole
surviving heir. Everybody knew this. But at this juncture an aunt turned
up from somewhere, with her boxes and bundles, her rosary, and a widowed
niece. She ensconced herself in Panchu's home and laid claim to a life
interest in all he had.

Panchu was dumbfounded. "My aunt died long ago," he protested.

In reply he was told that he was thinking of his uncle's first wife, but
that the former had lost no time in taking to himself a second.

"But my uncle died before my aunt," exclaimed Panchu, still more
mystified. "Where was the time for him to marry again?"

This was not denied. But Panchu was reminded that it had never been
asserted that the second wife had come after the death of the first, but
the former had been married by his uncle during the latter's lifetime.
Not relishing the idea of living with a co-wife she had remained in her
father's house till her husband's death, after which she had got
religion and retired to holy Brindaban, whence she was now coming. These
facts were well known to the officers of Harish Kundu, as well as to
some of his tenants. And if the *zamindar's* summons should be
peremptory enough, even some of those who had partaken of the marriage
feast would be forthcoming!
