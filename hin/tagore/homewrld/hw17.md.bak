### Sandip's Story

#### IV

When I read these pages of the story of my life I seriously question
myself: Is this Sandip? Am I made of words? Am I merely a book with a
covering of flesh and blood?

The earth is not a dead thing like the moon. She breathes. Her rivers
and oceans send up vapours in which she is clothed. She is covered with
a mantle of her own dust which flies about the air. The onlooker, gazing
upon the earth from the outside, can see only the light reflected from
this vapour and this dust. The tracks of the mighty continents are not
distinctly visible.

The man, who is alive as this earth is, is likewise always enveloped in
the mist of the ideas which he is breathing out. His real land and water
remain hidden, and he appears to be made of only lights and shadows.

It seems to me, in this story of my life, that, like a living plant, I
am displaying the picture of an ideal world. But I am not merely what I
want, what I think--I am also what I do not love, what I do not wish to
be. My creation had begun before I was born. I had no choice in regard
to my surroundings and so must make the best of such material as comes
to my hand.

My theory of life makes me certain that the Great is cruel To be just is
for ordinary men--it is reserved for the great to be unjust. The surface
of the earth was even. The volcano butted it with its fiery horn and
found its own eminence--its justice was not towards its obstacle, but
towards itself. Successful injustice and genuine cruelty have been the
only forces by which individual or nation has become millionaire or
monarch.

That is why I preach the great discipline of Injustice. I say to
everyone: Deliverance is based upon injustice. Injustice is the fire
which must keep on burning something in order to save itself from
becoming ashes. Whenever an individual or nation becomes incapable of
perpetrating injustice it is swept into the dust-bin of the world.

As yet this is only my idea--it is not completely myself. There are
rifts in the armour through which something peeps out which is extremely
soft and sensitive. Because, as I say, the best part of myself was
created before I came to this stage of existence.

From time to time I try my followers in their lesson of cruelty. One day
we went on a picnic. A goat was grazing by. I asked them: "Who is there
among you that can cut off a leg of that goat, alive, with this knife,
and bring it to me?" While they all hesitated, I went myself and did it.
One of them fainted at the sight. But when they saw me unmoved they took
the dust of my feet, saying that I was above all human weaknesses. That
is to say, they saw that day the vaporous envelope which was my idea,
but failed to perceive the inner me, which by a curious freak of fate
has been created tender and merciful.

In the present chapter of my life, which is growing in interest every
day round Bimala and Nikhil, there is also much that remains hidden
underneath. This malady of ideas which afflicts me is shaping my life
within: nevertheless a great part of my life remains outside its
influence; and so there is set up a discrepancy between my outward life
and its inner design which I try my best to keep concealed even from
myself; otherwise it may wreck not only my plans, but my very life.

Life is indefinite--a bundle of contradictions. We men, with our ideas,
strive to give it a particular shape by melting it into a particular
mould--into the definiteness of success. All the world-conquerors, from
Alexander down to the American millionaires, mould themselves into a
sword or a mint, and thus find that distinct image of themselves which
is the source of their success.

The chief controversy between Nikhil and myself arises from this: that
though I say "know thyself", and Nikhil also says "know thyself", his
interpretation makes this "knowing" tantamount to "not knowing".

"Winning your kind of success," Nikhil once objected, "is success gained
at the cost of the soul: but the soul is greater than success."

I simply said in answer: "Your words are too vague."

"That I cannot help," Nikhil replied. "A machine is distinct enough, but
not so life. If to gain distinctness you try to know life as a machine,
then such mere distinctness cannot stand for truth. The soul is not as
distinct as success, and so you only lose your soul if you seek it in
your success."

"Where, then, is this wonderful soul?"

"Where it knows itself in the infinite and transcends its success."

"But how does all this apply to our work for the country?"

"It is the same thing. Where our country makes itself the final object,
it gains success at the cost of the soul. Where it recognizes the
Greatest as greater than all, there it may miss success, but gains its
soul."

"Is there any example of this in history?"

"Man is so great that he can despise not only the success, but also the
example. Possibly example is lacking, just as there is no example of the
flower in the seed. But there is the urgence of the flower in the seed
all the same."

It is not that I do not at all understand Nikhil's point of view; that
is rather where my danger lies. I was born in India and the poison of
its spirituality runs in my blood. However loudly I may proclaim the
madness of walking in the path of self-abnegation, I cannot avoid it
altogether.

This is exactly how such curious anomalies happen nowadays in our
country. We must have our religion and also our nationalism; our
*Bhagavadgita* and also our *Bande Mataram*. The result is that both of
them suffer. It is like performing with an English military band, side
by side with our Indian festive pipes. I must make it the purpose of my
life to put an end to this hideous confusion.

I want the western military style to prevail, not the Indian. We shall
then not be ashamed of the flag of our passion, which mother Nature has
sent with us as our standard into the battlefield of life. Passion is
beautiful and pure--pure as the lily that comes out of the slimy soil.
It rises superior to its defilement and needs no Pears' soap to wash it
clean.
