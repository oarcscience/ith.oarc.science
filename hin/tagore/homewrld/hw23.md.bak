#### XII

In Bengal the machinery of time being thus suddenly run at full
pressure, things which were difficult became easy, one following soon
after another. Nothing could be held back any more, even in our corner
of the country. In the beginning our district was backward, for my
husband was unwilling to put any compulsion on the villagers. "Those who
make sacrifices for their country's sake are indeed her servants," he
would say, "but those who compel others to make them in her name are her
enemies. They would cut freedom at the root, to gain it at the top."

But when Sandip came and settled here, and his followers began to move
about the country, speaking in towns and market-places, waves of
excitement came rolling up to us as well. A band of young fellows of the
locality attached themselves to him, some even who had been known as a
disgrace to the village. But the glow of their genuine enthusiasm
lighted them up, within as well as without. It became quite clear that
when the pure breezes of a great joy and hope sweep through the land,
all dirt and decay are cleansed away. It is hard, indeed, for men to be
frank and straight and healthy, when their country is in the throes of
dejection.

Then were all eyes turned on my husband, from whose estates alone
foreign sugar and salt and cloths had not been banished. Even the estate
officers began to feel awkward and ashamed over it. And yet, some time
ago, when my husband began to import country-made articles into our
village, he had been secretly and openly twitted for his folly, by old
and young alike. When *Swadeshi* had not yet become a boast, we had
despised it with all our hearts.

My husband still sharpens his Indian-made pencils with his Indian-made
knife, does his writing with reed pens, drinks his water out of a
bell-metal vessel, and works at night in the light of an old-fashioned
castor-oil lamp. But this dull, milk-and-water *Swadeshi* of his never
appealed to us. Rather, we had always felt ashamed of the inelegant,
unfashionable furniture of his reception-rooms, especially when he had
the magistrate, or any other European, as his guest.

My husband used to make light of my protests. "Why allow such trifles to
upset you?" he would say with a smile.

"They will think us barbarians, or at all events wanting in refinement."

"If they do, I will pay them back by thinking that their refinement does
not go deeper than their white skins."

My husband had an ordinary brass pot on his writing-table which he used
as a flower-vase. It has often happened that, when I had news of some
European guest, I would steal into his room and put in its place a
crystal vase of European make. "Look here, Bimala," he objected at
length, "that brass pot is as unconscious of itself as those blossoms
are; but this thing protests its purpose so loudly, it is only fit for
artificial flowers."

The Bara Rani, alone, pandered to my husband's whims. Once she comes
panting to say: "Oh, brother, have you heard? Such lovely Indian soaps
have come out! My days of luxury are gone by; still, if they contain no
animal fat, I should like to try some."

This sort of thing makes my husband beam all over, and the house is
deluged with Indian scents and soaps. Soaps indeed! They are more like
lumps of caustic soda. And do I not know that what my sister-in-law uses
on herself are the European soaps of old, while these are made over to
the maids for washing clothes?

Another time it is: "Oh, brother dear, do get me some of these new
Indian pen-holders."

Her "brother" bubbles up as usual, and the Bara Rani's room becomes
littered with all kinds of awful sticks that go by the name of
*Swadeshi* pen-holders. Not that it makes any difference to her, for
reading and writing are out of her line. Still, in her writing-case,
lies the selfsame ivory pen-holder, the only one ever handled.

The fact is, all this was intended as a hit at me, because I would not
keep my husband company in his vagaries. It was no good trying to show
up my sister-in-law's insincerity; my husband's face would set so hard,
if I barely touched on it. One only gets into trouble, trying to save
such people from being imposed upon!

The Bara Rani loves sewing. One day I could not help blurting out: "What
a humbug you are, sister! When your 'brother' is present, your mouth
waters at the very mention of *Swadeshi* scissors, but it is the
English-made article every time when you work."

"What harm?" she replied. "Do you not see what pleasure it gives him? We
have grown up together in this house, since he was a boy. I simply
cannot bear, as you can, the sight of the smile leaving his face. Poor
dear, he has no amusement except this playing at shop-keeping. You are
his only dissipation, and you will yet be his ruin!"

"Whatever you may say, it is not right to be double-faced," I retorted.

My sister-in-law laughed out in my face. "Oh, our artless little Chota
Rani!--straight as a schoolmaster's rod, eh? But a woman is not built
that way. She is soft and supple, so that she may bend without being
crooked."

I could not forget those words: "You are his dissipation, and will be
his ruin!" Today I feel--if a man needs must have some intoxicant, let
it not be a woman.
