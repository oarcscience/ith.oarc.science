## Chapter Eight

### Nikhil's Story

#### X

Paragraphs and letters against me have begun to come out in the local
papers; cartoons and lampoons are to follow, I am told. Jets of wit and
humour are being splashed about, and the lies thus scattered are
convulsing the whole country. They know that the monopoly of
mud-throwing is theirs, and the innocent passerby cannot escape
unsoiled.

They are saying that the residents in my estates, from the highest to
the lowest, are in favour of *Swadeshi*, but they dare not declare
themselves, for fear of me. The few who have been brave enough to defy
me have felt the full rigour of my persecution. I am in secret league
with the police, and in private communication with the magistrate, and
these frantic efforts of mine to add a foreign title of my own earning
to the one I have inherited, will not, it is opined, go in vain.

On the other hand, the papers are full of praise for those devoted sons
of the motherland, the Kundu and the Chakravarti *zamindars*. If only,
say they, the country had a few more of such staunch patriots, the mills
of Manchester would have, had to sound their own dirge to the tune of
*Bande Mataram*.

Then comes a letter in blood-red ink, giving a list of the traitorous
*zamindars* whose treasuries have been burnt down because of their
failing to support the Cause. Holy Fire, it goes on to say, has been
aroused to its sacred function of purifying the country; and other
agencies are also at work to see that those who are not true sons of the
motherland do cease to encumber her lap. The signature is an obvious
*nom-de-plume*.

I could see that this was the doing of our local students. So I sent for
some of them and showed them the letter.

The B.A. student gravely informed me that they also had heard that a
band of desperate patriots had been formed who would stick at nothing in
order to clear away all obstacles to the success of *Swadeshi*.

"If," said I, "even one of our countrymen succumbs to these overbearing
desperadoes, that will indeed be a defeat for the country!"

"We fail to follow you, Maharaja," said the history student. "'Our
country," I tried to explain, "has been brought to death's door through
sheer fear--from fear of the gods down to fear of the police; and if you
set up, in the name of freedom, the fear of some other bogey, whatever
it may be called; if you would raise your victorious standard on the
cowardice of the country by means of downright oppression, then no true
lover of the country can bow to your decision."

"Is there any country, sir," pursued the history student, "where
submission to Government is not due to fear?"

"The freedom that exists in any country," I replied, "may be measured by
the extent of this reign of fear. Where its threat is confined to those
who would hurt or plunder, there the Government may claim to have freed
man from the violence of man. But if fear is to regulate how people are
to dress, where they shall trade, or what they must eat, then is man's
freedom of will utterly ignored, and manhood destroyed at the root."

"Is not such coercion of the individual will seen in other countries
too?" continued the history student.

"Who denies it?" I exclaimed. "But in every country man has destroyed
himself to the extent that he has permitted slavery to flourish."

"Does it not rather show," interposed a Master of Arts, "that trading in
slavery is inherent in man--a fundamental fact of his nature?"

"Sandip Babu made the whole thing clear," said a graduate. "He gave us
the example of Harish Kundu, your neighbouring *zamindar*. From his
estates you cannot ferret out a single ounce of foreign salt. Why?
Because he has always ruled with an iron hand. In the case of those who
are slaves by nature, the lack of a strong master is the greatest of all
calamities."

"Why, sir!" chimed in an undergraduate, "have you not heard of the
obstreperous tenant of Chakravarti, the other *zamindar* close by--how
the law was set on him till he was reduced to utter destitution? When at
last he was left with nothing to eat, he started out to sell his wife's
silver ornaments, but no one dared buy them. Then Chakravarti's manager
offered him five rupees for the lot. They were worth over thirty, but he
had to accept or starve. After taking over the bundle from him the
manager coolly said that those five rupees would be credited towards his
rent! We felt like having nothing more to do with Chakravarti or his
manager after that, but Sandip Babu told us that if we threw over all
the live people, we should have only dead bodies from the
burning-grounds to carry on the work with! These live men, he pointed
out, know what they want and how to get it--they are born rulers. Those
who do not know how to desire for themselves, must live in accordance
with, or die by virtue of, the desires of such as these. Sandip Babu
contrasted them--Kundu and Chakravarti-- with you, Maharaja. You, he
said, for all your good intentions, will never succeed in planting
*Swadeshi* within your territory."

"It is my desire," I said, "to plant something greater than *Swadeshi*.
I am not after dead logs but living trees--and these will take time to
grow."

"I am afraid, sir," sneered the history student, "that you will get
neither log nor tree. Sandip Babu rightly teaches that in order to get,
you must snatch. This is taking all of us some time to learn, because it
runs counter to what we were taught at school. I have seen with my own
eyes that when a rent-collector of Harish Kundu's found one of the
tenants with nothing which could be sold up to pay his rent, he was made
to sell his young wife! Buyers were not wanting, and the *zamindar's*
demand was satisfied. I tell you, sir, the sight of that man's distress
prevented my getting sleep for nights together! But, feel it as I did,
this much I realized, that the man who knows how to get the money he is
out for, even by selling up his debtor's wife, is a better man than I
am. I confess it is beyond me--I am a weakling, my eyes fill with tears.
If anybody can save our country it is these Kundus and these
Chakravartis and their officials!"

I was shocked beyond words. "If what you say be true," I cried, "I
clearly see that it must be the one endeavour of my life to save the
country from these same Kundus and Chakravartis and officials. The
slavery that has entered into our very bones is breaking out, at this
opportunity, as ghastly tyranny. You have been so used to submit to
domination through fear, you have come to believe that to make others
submit is a kind of religion. My fight shall be against this weakness,
this atrocious cruelty!" These things, which are so simple to ordinary
folk, get so twisted in the minds of our B.A.'s and M.A.'s, the only
purpose of whose historical quibbles seems to be to torture the truth!
