#### XIV

On returning home I asked my master to come over. He shook his head
gravely. "I see no good in this," said he--"this setting aside of
conscience and putting the country in its place. All the sins of the
country will now break out, hideous and unashamed."

"Who do you think could have ..."

"Don't ask me. But sin is rampant. Send them all away, right away from
here."

"I have given them one more day. They will be leaving the day after
tomorrow."

"And another thing. Take Bimala away to Calcutta. She is getting too
narrow a view of the outside world from here, she cannot see men and
things in their true proportions. Let her see the world--men and their
work--give her abroad vision."

"That is exactly what I was thinking."

"Well, don't make any delay about it. I tell you, Nikhil, man's history
has to be built by the united effort of all the races in the world, and
therefore this selling of conscience for political reasons--this making
a fetish of one's country, won't do. I know that Europe does not at
heart admit this, but there she has not the right to pose as our
teacher. Men who die for the truth become immortal: and, if a whole
people can die for the truth, it will also achieve immortality in the
history of humanity. Here, in this land of India, amid the mocking
laughter of Satan piercing the sky, may the feeling for this truth
become real! What a terrible epidemic of sin has been brought into our
country from foreign lands..."

The whole day passed in the turmoil of investigation. I was tired out
when I retired for the night. I left over sending my sister-in-law's
money to the treasury till next morning.

I woke up from my sleep at dead of night. The room was dark. I thought I
heard a moaning somewhere. Somebody must have been crying. Sounds of
sobbing came heavy with tears like fitful gusts of wind in the rainy
night. It seemed to me that the cry rose from the heart of my room
itself. I was alone. For some days Bimala had her bed in another room
adjoining mine. I rose up and when I went out I found her in the balcony
lying prone upon her face on the bare floor.

This is something that cannot be written in words. He only knows it who
sits in the bosom of the world and receives all its pangs in His own
heart. The sky is dumb, the stars are mute, the night is still, and in
the midst of it all that one sleepless cry!

We give these sufferings names, bad or good, according to the
classifications of the books, but this agony which is welling up from a
torn heart, pouring into the fathomless dark, has it any name? When in
that midnight, standing under the silent stars, I looked upon that
figure, my mind was struck with awe, and I said to myself: "Who am I to
judge her?" O life, O death, O God of the infinite existence, I bow my
head in silence to the mystery which is in you.

Once I thought I should turn back. But I could not. I sat down on the
ground near Bimala and placed my hand on her head. At the first touch
her whole body seemed to stiffen, but the next moment the hardness gave
way, and the tears burst out. I gently passed my fingers over her
forehead. Suddenly her hands groping for my feet grasped them and drew
them to herself, pressing them against her breast with such force that I
thought her heart would break.
