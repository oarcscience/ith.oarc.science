## Chapter Four

### Nikhil's Story

#### III

I was never self-conscious. But nowadays I often try to take an outside
view--to see myself as Bimal sees me. What a dismally solemn picture it
makes, my habit of taking things too seriously!

Better, surely, to laugh away the world than flood it with tears. That
is, in fact, how the world gets on. We relish our food and rest, only
because we can dismiss, as so many empty shadows, the sorrows scattered
everywhere, both in the home and in the outer world. If we took them as
true, even for a moment, where would be our appetite, our sleep?

But I cannot dismiss myself as one of these shadows, and so the load of
my sorrow lies eternally heavy on the heart of my world.

Why not stand out aloof in the highway of the universe, and feel
yourself to be part of the all? In the midst of the immense, age-long
concourse of humanity, what is Bimal to you? Your wife? What is a wife?
A bubble of a name blown big with your own breath, so carefully guarded
night and day, yet ready to burst at any pin-prick from outside.

My wife--and so, forsooth, my very own! If she says: "No, I am
myself"--am I to reply: "How can that be? Are you not mine?"

"My wife"--Does that amount to an argument, much less the truth? Can one
imprison a whole personality within that name?

My wife!--Have I not cherished in this little world all that is purest
and sweetest in my life, never for a moment letting it down from my
bosom to the dust? What incense of worship, what music of passion, what
flowers of my spring and of my autumn, have I not offered up at its
shrine? If, like a toy paper-boat, she be swept along into the muddy
waters of the gutter--would I not also...?

There it is again, my incorrigible solemnity! Why "muddy"? What
"gutter,? Names, called in a fit of jealousy, do not change the facts of
the world. If Bimal is not mine, she is not; and no fuming, or fretting,
or arguing will serve to prove that she is. If my heart is breaking--let
it break! That will not make the world bankrupt--nor even me; for man is
so much greater than the things he loses in this life. The very ocean of
tears has its other shore, else none would have ever wept.

But then there is Society to be considered ... which let Society
consider! If I weep it is for myself, not for Society. If Bimal should
say she is not mine, what care I where my Society wife may be? Suffering
there must be; but I must save myself, by any means in my power, from
one form of self-torture: I must never think that my life loses its
value because of any neglect it may suffer. The full value of my life
does not all go to buy my narrow domestic world; its great commerce does
not stand or fall with some petty success or failure in the bartering of
my personal joys and sorrows.

The time has come when I must divest Bimala of all the ideal decorations
with which I decked her. It was owing to my own weakness that I indulged
in such idolatry. I was too greedy. I created an angel of Bimala, in
order to exaggerate my own enjoyment. But Bimala is what she is. It is
preposterous to expect that she should assume the rôle of an angel for
my pleasure. The Creator is under no obligation to supply me with
angels, just because I have an avidity for imaginary perfection.

I must acknowledge that I have merely been an accident in Bimala's life.
Her nature, perhaps, can only find true union with one like Sandip. At
the same time, I must not, in false modesty, accept my rejection as my
desert. Sandip certainly has attractive qualities, which had their sway
also upon myself; but yet, I feel sure, he is not a greater man than I.
If the wreath of victory falls to his lot today, and I am overlooked,
then the dispenser of the wreath will be called to judgement.

I say this in no spirit of boasting. Sheer necessity has driven me to
the pass, that to secure myself from utter desolation I must recognize
all the value that I truly possess. Therefore, through the, terrible
experience of suffering let there come upon me the joy of
deliverance--deliverance from self-distrust.

I have come to distinguish what is really in me from what I foolishly
imagined to be there. The profit and loss account has been settled, and
that which remains is myself--not a crippled self, dressed in rags and
tatters, not a sick self to be nursed on invalid diet, but a spirit
which has gone through the worst, and has survived.

My master passed through my room a moment ago and said with his hand on
my shoulder. "Get away to bed, Nikhil, the night is far advanced."

The fact is, it has become so difficult for me to go to bed till
late--till Bimal is fast asleep. In the day-time we meet, and even
converse, but what am I to say when we are alone together, in the
silence of the night?--so ashamed do I feel in mind and body.

"How is it, sir, you have not yet retired?" I asked in my turn. My
master smiled a little, as he left me, saying: "My sleeping days are
over. I have now attained the waking age.

I had written thus far, and was about to rise to go off bedwards when,
through the window before me, I saw the heavy pall of July cloud
suddenly part a little, and a big star shine through. It seemed to say
to me: "Dreamland ties are made, and dreamland ties are broken, but I am
here for ever--the everlasting lamp of the bridal night."

All at once my heart was full with the thought that my Eternal Love was
steadfastly waiting for me through the ages, behind the veil of material
things. Through many a life, in many a mirror, have I seen her
image--broken mirrors, crooked mirrors, dusty mirrors. Whenever I have
sought to make the mirror my very own, and shut it up within my box, I
have lost sight of the image. But what of that. What have I to do with
the mirror, or even the image?

My beloved, your smile shall never fade, and every dawn there shall
appear fresh for me the vermilion mark on your forehead!

"What childish cajolery of self-deception," mocks some devil from his
dark corner--"silly prattle to make children quiet!"

That may be. But millions and millions of children, with their million
cries, have to be kept quiet. Can it be that all this multitude is
quieted with only a lie? No, my Eternal Love cannot deceive me, for she
is true!

She is true; that is why I have seen her and shall see her so often,
even in my mistakes, even through the thickest mist of tears. I have
seen her and lost her in the crowd of life's market-place, and found her
again; and I shall find her once more when I have escaped through the
loophole of death.

Ah, cruel one, play with me no longer! If I have failed to track you by
the marks of your footsteps on the way, by the scent of your tresses
lingering in the air, make me not weep for that for ever. The unveiled
star tells me not to fear. That which is eternal must always be there.

Now let me go and see my Bimala. She must have spread her tired limbs on
the bed, limp after her struggles, and be asleep. I will leave a kiss on
her forehead without waking her--that shall be the flower-offering of my
worship. I believe I could forget everything after death--all my
mistakes, all my sufferings--but some vibration of the memory of that
kiss would remain; for the wreath which is being woven out of the kisses
of many a successive birth is to crown the Eternal Beloved.

As the gong of the watch rang out, sounding the hour of two, my
sister-in-law came into the room. "Whatever are you doing, brother
dear?"  <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md) she cried. "For pity's sake
go to bed and stop worrying so. I cannot bear to look on that awful
shadow of pain on your face." Tears welled up in her eyes and overflowed
as she entreated me thus.

I could not utter a word, but took the dust of her feet, as I went off
to bed.
