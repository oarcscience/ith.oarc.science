<title>Intangible Textual Heritage: The Writings of Rabindranath Tagore</title>

Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was a Bengali poet, philosopher, artist,
playwright, composer and novelist. India's first Nobel laureate, Tagore
won the 1913 Nobel Prize for Literature. He composed the text of both
India's and Bangladesh's respective national anthems. Tagore travelled
widely and was friends with many notable 20th century figures such as
[William Butler Yeats](../../neu/yeats/index.md), H.G. Wells, Ezra Pound,
and [Albert Einstein](../../aor/einstein/index.md). While he supported
Indian Independence, he often had tactical disagreements with Gandhi (at
one point talking him out of a fast to the death). His body of
literature is deeply sympathetic for the poor and upholds universal
humanistic values. His poetry drew from traditional Vaisnava folk lyrics
and was often deeply mystical.
