THE RELATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE UNIVERSE

The civilisation of ancient Greece was nurtured within city walls. In
fact, all the modern civilisations have their cradles of brick and
mortar.

These walls leave their mark deep in the minds of men. They set up a
principle of "divide and rule" in our mental outlook, which begets in us
a habit of securing all our conquests by fortifying them and separating
them from one another. We divide nation and nation, knowledge and
knowledge, man and nature. It breeds in us a strong suspicion of
whatever is beyond the barriers we have built, and everything has to
fight hard for its entrance into our recognition.

When the first Aryan invaders appeared in India it was a vast land of
forests, and the new-comers rapidly took advantage of them. These
forests afforded them shelter from the fierce heat of the sun and the
ravages of tropical storms, pastures for cattle, fuel for sacrificial
fire, and materials for building cottages. And the different Aryan clans
with their patriarchal heads settled in the different forest tracts
which had some special advantage of natural protection, and food and
water in plenty.

Thus in India it was in the forests that our civilisation had its birth,
and it took a distinct character from this origin and environment. It
was surrounded by the vast life of nature, was fed and clothed by her,
and had the closest and most constant intercourse with her varying
aspects.

Such a life, it may be thought, tends to have the effect of dulling
human intelligence and dwarfing the incentives to progress by lowering
the standards of existence. But in ancient India we find that the
circumstances of forest life did not overcome man's mind, and did not
enfeeble the current of his energies, but only gave to it a particular
direction. Having been in constant contact with the living growth of
nature, his mind was free from the desire to extend his dominion by
erecting boundary walls around his acquisitions. His aim was not to
acquire but to realise, to enlarge his consciousness by growing with and
growing into his surroundings. He felt that truth is all-comprehensive,
that there is no such thing as absolute isolation in existence, and the
only way of attaining truth is through the interpenetration of our being
into all objects. To realise this great harmony between man's spirit and
the spirit of the world was the endeavour of the forest-dwelling sages
of ancient India.

In later days there came a time when these primeval forests gave way to
cultivated fields, and wealthy cities sprang up on all sides. Mighty
kingdoms were established, which had communications with all the great
powers of the world. But even in the heyday of its material prosperity
the heart of India ever looked back with adoration upon the early ideal
of strenuous self-realisation, and the dignity of the simple life of the
forest hermitage, and drew its best inspiration from the wisdom stored
there.

The west seems to take a pride in thinking that it is subduing nature;
as if we are living in a hostile world where we have to wrest everything
we want from an unwilling and alien arrangement of things. This
sentiment is the product of the city-wall habit and training of mind.
For in the city life man naturally directs the concentrated light of his
mental vision upon his own life and works, and this creates an
artificial dissociation between himself and the Universal Nature within
whose bosom he lies.

But in India the point of view was different; it included the world with
the man as one great truth. India put all her emphasis on the harmony
that exists between the individual and the universal. She felt we could
have no communication whatever with our surroundings if they were
absolutely foreign to us. Man's complaint against nature is that he has
to acquire most of his necessaries by his own efforts. Yes, but his
efforts are not in vain; he is reaping success every day, and that shows
there is a rational connection between him and nature, for we never can
make anything our own except that which is truly related to us.

We can look upon a road from two different points of view. One regards
it as dividing us from the object of our desire; in that case we count
every step of our journey over it as something attained by force in the
face of obstruction. The other sees it as the road which leads us to our
destination; and as such it is part of our goal. It is already the
beginning of our attainment, and by journeying over it we can only gain
that which in itself it offers to us. This last point of view is that of
India with regard to nature. For her, the great fact is that we are in
harmony with nature; that man can think because his thoughts are in
harmony with things; that he can use the forces of nature for his own
purpose only because his power is in harmony with the power which is
universal, and that in the long run his purpose never can knock against
the purpose which works through nature.

In the west the prevalent feeling is that nature belongs exclusively to
inanimate things and to beasts, that there is a sudden unaccountable
break where human-nature begins. According to it, everything that is low
in the scale of beings is merely nature, and whatever has the stamp of
perfection on it, intellectual or moral, is human-nature. It is like
dividing the bud and the blossom into two separate categories, and
putting their grace to the credit of two different and antithetical
principles. But the Indian mind never has any hesitation in
acknowledging its kinship with nature, its unbroken relation with all.

The fundamental unity of creation was not simply a philosophical
speculation for India; it was her life-object to realise this great
harmony in feeling and in action. With mediation and service, with a
regulation of life, she cultivated her consciousness in such a way that
everything had a spiritual meaning to her. The earth, water and light,
fruits and flowers, to her were not merely physical phenomena to be
turned to use and then left aside. They were necessary to her in the
attainment of her ideal of perfection, as every note is necessary to the
completeness of the symphony. India intuitively felt that the essential
fact of this world has a vital meaning for us; we have to be fully alive
to it and establish a conscious relation with it, not merely impelled by
scientific curiosity or greed of material advantage, but realising it in
the spirit of sympathy, with a large feeling of joy and peace.

The man of science knows, in one aspect, that the world is not merely
what it appears to be to our senses; he knows that earth and water are
really the play of forces that manifest themselves to us as earth and
water--how, we can but partially apprehend. Likewise the man who has his
spiritual eyes open knows that the ultimate truth about earth and water
lies in our apprehension of the eternal will which works in time and
takes shape in the forces we realise under those aspects. This is not
mere knowledge, as science is, but it is a preception of the soul by the
soul. This does not lead us to power, as knowledge does, but it gives us
joy, which is the product of the union of kindred things. The man whose
acquaintance with the world does not lead him deeper than science leads
him, will never understand what it is that the man with the spiritual
vision finds in these natural phenomena. The water does not merely
cleanse his limbs, but it purifies his heart; for it touches his soul.
The earth does not merely hold his body, but it gladdens his mind; for
its contact is more than a physical contact--it is a living presence.
When a man does not realise his kinship with the world, he lives in a
prison-house whose walls are alien to him. When he meets the eternal
spirit in all objects, then is he emancipated, for then he discovers the
fullest significance of the world into which he is born; then he finds
himself in perfect truth, and his harmony with the all is established.
In India men are enjoined to be fully awake to the fact that they are in
the closest relation to things around them, body and soul, and that they
are to hail the morning sun, the flowing water, the fruitful earth, as
the manifestation of the same living truth which holds them in its
embrace. Thus the text of our everyday meditation is the *Gayathri*, a
verse which is considered to be the epitome of all the Vedas. By its
help we try to realise the essential unity of the world with the
conscious soul of man; we learn to perceive the unity held together by
the one Eternal Spirit, whose power creates the earth, the sky, and the
stars, and at the same time irradiates our minds with the light of a
consciousness that moves and exists in unbroken continuity with the
outer world.

It is not true that India has tried to ignore differences of value in
different things, for she knows that would make life impossible. The
sense of the superiority of man in the scale of creation has not been
absent from her mind. But she has had her own idea as to that in which
his superiority really consists. It is not in the power of possession
but in the power of union. Therefore India chose her places of
pilgrimage wherever there was in nature some special grandeur or beauty,
so that her mind could come out of its world of narrow necessities and
realise its place in the infinite. This was the reason why in India a
whole people who once were meat-eaters gave up taking animal food to
cultivate the sentiment of universal sympathy for life, an event unique
in the history of mankind.

India knew that when by physical and mental barriers we violently detach
ourselves from the inexhaustible life of nature; when we become merely
man, but not man-in-the-universe, we create bewildering problems, and
having shut off the source of their solution, we try all kinds of
artificial methods each of which brings its own crop of interminable
difficulties. When man leaves his resting-place in universal nature,
when he walks on the single rope of humanity, it means either a dance or
a fall for him, he has ceaselessly to strain every nerve and muscle to
keep his balance at each step, and then, in the intervals of his
weariness, he fulminates against Providence and feels a secret pride and
satisfaction in thinking that he has been unfairly dealt with by the
whole scheme of things.

But this cannot go on for ever. Man must realise the wholeness of his
existence, his place in the infinite; he must know that hard as he may
strive he can never create his honey within the cells of his hive; for
the perennial supply of his life food is outside their walls. He must
know that when man shuts himself out from the vitalising and purifying
touch of the infinite, and falls back upon himself for his sustenance
and his healing, then he goads himself into madness, tears himself into
shreds, and eats his own substance. Deprived of the background of the
whole, his poverty loses its one great quality, which is simplicity, and
becomes squalid and shamefaced. His wealth is no longer magnanimous; it
grows merely extravagant. His appetites do not minister to his life,
keeping to the limits of their purpose; they become an end in themselves
and set fire to his life and play the fiddle in the lurid light of the
conflagration. Then it is that in our self-expression we try to startle
and not to attract; in art we strive for originality and lose sight of
truth which is old and yet ever new; in literature we miss the complete
view of man which is simple and yet great, but he appears as a
psychological problem or the embodiment of a passion that is intense
because abnormal and because exhibited in the glare of a fiercely
emphatic light which is artificial. When man's consciousness is
restricted only to the immediate vicinity of his human self, the deeper
roots of his nature do not find their permanent soil, his spirit is ever
on the brink of starvation, and in the place of healthful strength he
substitutes rounds of stimulation. Then it is that man misses his inner
perspective and measures his greatness by its bulk and not by its vital
link with the infinite, judges his activity by its movement and not by
the repose of perfection--the repose which is in the starry heavens, in
the ever-flowing rhythmic dance of creation.

The first invasion of India has its exact parallel in the invasion of
America by the European settlers. They also were confronted with
primeval forests and a fierce struggle with aboriginal races. But this
struggle between man and man, and man and nature lasted till the very
end; they never came to any terms. In India the forests which were the
habitation of the barbarians became the sanctuary of sages, but in
America these great living cathedrals of nature had no deeper
significance to man. The brought wealth and power to him, and perhaps at
times they ministered to his enjoyment of beauty, and inspired a
solitary poet. They never acquired a sacred association in the hearts of
men as the site of some great spiritual reconcilement where man's soul
has its meeting-place with the soul of the world.

I do not for a moment wish to suggest that these things should have been
otherwise. It would be an utter waste of opportunities if history were
to repeat itself exactly in the same manner in every place. It is best
for the commerce of the spirit that people differently situated should
bring their different products into the market of humanity, each of
which is complementary and necessary to the others. All that I wish to
say is that India at the outset of her career met with a special
combination of circumstances which was not lost upon her. She had,
according to her opportunities, thought and pondered, striven and
suffered, dived into the depths of existence, and achieved something
which surely cannot be without its value to people whose evolution in
history took a different way altogether. Man for his perfect growth
requires all the living elements that constitute his complex life; that
is why his food has to be cultivated in different fields and brought
from different sources.

Civilisation is a kind of mould that each nation is busy making for
itself to shape its men and women according to its best ideal. All its
institutions, its legislature, its standard of approbation and
condemnation, its conscious and unconscious teachings tend toward that
object. The modern civilisation of the west, by all its organised
efforts, is trying to turn out men perfect in physical, intellectual,
and moral efficiency. There the vast energies of the nations are
employed in extending man's power over his surroundings, and people are
combining and straining every faculty to possess and to turn to account
all that they can lay their hands upon, to overcome every obstacle on
their path of conquest. They are ever disciplining themselves to fight
nature and other races; their armaments are getting more and more
stupendous every day; their machines, their appliances, their
organisations go on multiplying at an amazing rate. This is a splendid
achievement, no doubt, and a wonderful manifestation of man's
masterfulness which knows no obstacle, and which has for its object the
supremacy of himself over everything else.

The ancient civilisation of India had its own ideal of perfection
towards which its efforts were directed. Its aim was not attaining
power, and it neglected to cultivate to the utmost its capacities, and
to organise men for defensive and offensive purposes, for co-operation
in the acquisition of wealth and for military and political ascendancy.
The ideal that India tried to realise led her best men to the isolation
of a contemplative life, and the treasures that she gained for mankind
by penetrating into the mysteries of reality cost her dear in the sphere
of worldly success. Yet, this also was a sublime achievement,--it was a
supreme manifestation of that human aspiration which knows no limit, and
which has for its object nothing less than the realisation of the
Infinite.

There were the virtuous, the wise, the courageous; there were the
statesmen, kings and emperors of India; but whom amongst all these
classes did she look up to and choose to be the representative of men?

They were the rishis. What were the rishis? *They who having attained
the supreme soul in knowledge were filled with wisdom, and having found
him in union with the soul were in perfect harmony with the inner self;
they having realised him in the heart were free from all selfish
desires, and having experienced him in all the activities of the world,
had attained calmness. The rishis were they who having reached the
supreme God from all sides had found abiding peace, had become united
with all, had entered into the life of the Universe.*  <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

Thus the state of realising our relationship with all, of entering into
everything through union with God, was considered in India to be the
ultimate end and fulfilment of humanity.

Man can destroy and plunder, earn and accumulate, invent and discover,
but he is great because his soul comprehends all. It is dire destruction
for him when he envelopes his soul in a dead shell of callous habits,
and when a blind fury of works whirls round him like an eddying dust
storm, shutting out the horizon. That indeed kills the very spirit of
his being, which is the spirit of comprehension. Essentially man is not
a slave either of himself or of the world; but he is a lover. His
freedom and fulfilment is in love, which is another name for perfect
comprehension. By this power of comprehension, this permeation of his
being, he is united with the all-pervading Spirit, who is also the
breath of his soul. Where a man tries to raise himself to eminence by
pushing and jostling all others, to achieve a distinction by which he
prides himself to be more than everybody else, there he is alienated
from that Spirit. This is why the Upanishads describe those who have
attained the goal of human life as "*peaceful*"  <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) and as "*at-one-with- God*,"  <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) meaning that they are in perfect harmony
with man and nature, and therefore in undisturbed union with God.

We have a glimpse of the same truth in the teachings of Jesus when he
says, "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven"-- which implies that
whatever we treasure for ourselves separates us from others; our
possessions are our limitations. He who is bent upon accumulating riches
is unable, with his ego continually bulging, to pass through the gates
of comprehension of the spiritual world, which is the world of perfect
harmony; he is shut up within the narrow walls of his limited
acquisitions.

Hence the spirit of the teachings of Upanishad is: In order to find him
you must embrace all. In the pursuit of wealth you really give up
everything to gain a few things, and that is not the way to attain him
who is completeness.

Some modern philosophers of Europe, who are directly or indirectly
indebted to the Upanishads, far from realising their debt, maintain that
the Brahma of India is a mere abstraction, a negation of all that is in
the world. In a word, that the Infinite Being is to be found nowhere
except in metaphysics. It may be, that such a doctrine has been and
still is prevalent with a section of our countrymen. But this is
certainly not in accord with the pervading spirit of the Indian mind.
Instead, it is the practice of realising and affirming the presence of
the infinite in all things which has been its constant inspiration.

We are enjoined to see *whatever there is in the world as being
enveloped by God.*  <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md)

*I bow to God over and over again who is in fire and in water, who
permeates the whole world, who is in the annual crops as well as in the
perennial trees.*  <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md)

Can this be God abstracted from the world? Instead, it signifies not
merely seeing him in all things, but saluting him in all the objects of
the world. The attitude of the God-conscious man of the Upanishad
towards the universe is one of a deep feeling of adoration. His object
of worship is present everywhere. It is the one living truth that makes
all realities true. This truth is not only of knowledge but of devotion.
'*Namonamah*,'--we bow to him everywhere, and over and over again. It is
recognised in the outburst of the Rishi, who addresses the whole world
in a sudden ecstasy of joy: *Listen to me, ye sons of the immortal
spirit, ye who live in the heavenly abode, I have known the Supreme
Person whose light shines forth from beyond the darkness.*  <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) Do we not find the overwhelming delight of a
direct and positive experience where there is not the least trace of
vagueness or passivity?

Buddha who developed the practical side of the teaching of Upanishads,
preached the same message when he said, *With everything, whether it is
above or below, remote or near, visible or invisible, thou shalt
preserve a relation of unlimited love without any animosity or without a
desire to kill. To live in such a consciousness while standing or
walking, sitting or lying down till you are asleep, is Brahma vihāra,
or, in other words, is living and moving and having your joy in the
spirit of Brahma.*

What is that spirit? The Upanishad says, *The being who is in his
essence the light and life of all, who is world-conscious, is Brahma.*
 <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) To feel all, to be conscious of
everything, is his spirit. We are immersed in his consciousness body and
soul. It is through his consciousness that the sun attracts the earth;
it is through his consciousness that the light-waves are being
transmitted from planet to planet.

Not only in space, but *this light and life, this all-feeling being is
in our souls.*  <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) He is all-conscious in
space, or the world of extension; and he is all-conscious in soul, or
the world of intension.

Thus to attain our world-consciousness, we have to unite our feeling
with this all-pervasive infinite feeling. In fact, the only true human
progress is coincident with this widening of the range of feeling. All
our poetry, philosophy, science, art and religion are serving to extend
the scope of our consciousness towards higher and larger spheres. Man
does not acquire rights through occupation of larger space, nor through
external conduct, but his rights extend only so far as he is real, and
his reality is measured by the scope of his consciousness.

We have, however, to pay a price for this attainment of the freedom of
consciousness. What is the price? It is to give one's self away. Our
soul can realise itself truly only by denying itself. The Upanishad
says, *Thou shalt gain by giving away*  <span
id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) , *Thou shalt not covet.*  <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md)

In Gita we are advised to work disinterestedly, abandoning all lust for
the result. Many outsiders conclude from this teaching that the
conception of the world as something unreal lies at the root of the
so-called disinterestedness preached in India. But the reverse is true.

The man who aims at his own aggrandisement underrates everything else.
Compared to his ego the rest of the world is unreal. Thus in order to be
fully conscious of the reality of all, one has to be free himself from
the bonds of personal desires. This discipline we have to go through to
prepare ourselves for our social duties--for sharing the burdens of our
fellow-beings. Every endeavour to attain a larger life requires of man
"to gain by giving away, and not to be greedy." And thus to expand
gradually the consciousness of one's unity with all is the striving of
humanity.

The Infinite in India was not a thin nonentity, void of all content. The
Rishis of India asserted emphatically, "To know him in this life is to
be true; not to know him in this life is the desolation of death."
 <span id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) How to know him then? "By
realising him in each and all."  <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md)
Not only in nature but in the family, in society, and in the state, the
more we realise the World- conscious in all, the better for us. Failing
to realise it, we turn our faces to destruction.

It fills me with great joy and a high hope for the future of humanity
when I realise that there was a time in the remote past when our
poet-prophets stood under the lavish sunshine of an Indian sky and
greeted the world with the glad recognition of kindred. It was not an
anthropomorphic hallucination. It was not seeing man reflected
everywhere in grotesquely exaggerated images, and witnessing the human
drama acted on a gigantic scale in nature's arena of flitting lights and
shadows. On the contrary, it meant crossing the limiting barriers of the
individual, to become more than man, to become one with the All. It was
not a mere play of the imagination, but it was the liberation of
consciousness from all the mystifications and exaggerations of the self.
These ancient seers felt in the serene depth of their mind that the same
energy which vibrates and passes into the endless forms of the world
manifests itself in our inner being as consciousness; and there is no
break in unity. For these seers there was no gap in their luminous
vision of perfection. They never acknowledged even death itself as
creating a chasm in the field of reality. They said, *His reflection is
death as well as immortality.*  <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md)
They did not recognise any essential opposition between life and death,
and they said with absolute assurance, "It is life that is death."
 <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) They saluted with the same
serenity of gladness "life in its aspect of appearing and in its aspect
of departure"-- *That which is past is hidden in life, and that which is
to come.*  <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md) They knew that mere
appearance and disappearance are on the surface like waves on the sea,
but life which is permanent knows no decay or diminution.

*Everything has sprung from immortal life and is vibrating with life*,
 <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md) *for life is immense.*  <span
id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md)

This is the noble heritage from our forefathers waiting to be claimed by
us as our own, this ideal of the supreme freedom of consciousness. It is
not merely intellectual or emotional, it has an ethical basis, and it
must be translated into action. In the Upanishad it is said, *The
supreme being is all-pervading, therefore he is the innate good in all.*
 <span id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) To be truly united in knowledge,
love, and service with all beings, and thus to realise one's self in the
all-pervading God is the essence of goodness, and this is the keynote of
the teachings of the Upanishads: *Life is immense!*  <span
id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md)
