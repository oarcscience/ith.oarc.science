V

REALISATION IN LOVE

We come now to the eternal problem of co-existence of the infinite and
the finite, of the supreme being and our soul. There is a sublime
paradox that lies at the root of existence. We never can go round it,
because we never can stand outside the problem and weigh it against any
other possible alternative. But the problem exists in logic only; in
reality it does not offer us any difficulty at all. Logically speaking,
the distance between two points, however near, may be said to be
infinite because it is infinitely divisible. But we *do* cross the
infinite at every step, and meet the eternal in every second. Therefore
some of our philosophers say there is no such thing as finitude; it is
but a *māyā*, an illusion. The real is the infinite, and it is only
*māyā*, the unreality, which causes the appearance of the finite. But
the word *māyā* is a mere name, it is no explanation. It is merely
saying that with truth there is this appearance which is the opposite of
truth; but how they come to exist at one and the same time is
incomprehensible.

We have what we call in Sanskrit *dvandva*, a series of opposites in
creation; such as, the positive pole and the negative, the centripetal
force and the centrifugal, attraction and repulsion. These are also mere
names, they are no explanations. They are only different ways of
asserting that the world in its essence is a reconciliation of pairs of
opposing forces. These forces, like the left and the right hands of the
creator, are acting in absolute harmony, yet acting from opposite
directions.

There is a bond of harmony between our two eyes, which makes them act in
unison. Likewise there is an unbreakable continuity of relation in the
physical world between heat and cold, light and darkness, motion and
rest, as between the bass and treble notes of a piano. That is why these
opposites do not bring confusion in the universe, but harmony. If
creation were but a chaos, we should have to imagine the two opposing
principles as trying to get the better of each other. But the universe
is not under martial law, arbitrary and provisional. Here we find no
force which can run amok, or go on indefinitely in its wild road, like
an exiled outlaw, breaking all harmony with its surroundings; each
force, on the contrary, has to come back in a curved line to its
equilibrium. Waves rise, each to its individual height in a seeming
attitude of unrelenting competition, but only up to a certain point; and
thus we know of the great repose of the sea to which they are all
related, and to which they must all return in a rhythm which is
marvellously beautiful.

In fact, these undulations and vibrations, these risings and fallings,
are not due to the erratic contortions of disparate bodies, they are a
rhythmic dance. Rhythm never can be born of the haphazard struggle of
combat. Its underlying principle must be unity, not opposition.

This principle of unity is the mystery of all mysteries. The existence
of a duality at once raises a question in our minds, and we seek its
solution in the One. When at last we find a relation between these two,
and thereby see them as one in essence, we feel that we have come to the
truth. And then we give utterance to this most startling of all
paradoxes, that the One appears as many, that the appearance is the
opposite of truth and yet is inseparably related to it.

Curiously enough, there are men who lose that feeling of mystery, which
is at the root of all our delights, when they discover the uniformity of
law among the diversity of nature. As if gravitation is not more of a
mystery than the fall of an apple, as if the evolution from one scale of
being to the other is not something which is even more shy of
explanation than a succession of creations. The trouble is that we very
often stop at such a law as if it were the final end of our search, and
then we find that it does not even begin to emancipate our spirit. It
only gives satisfaction to our intellect, and as it does not appeal to
our whole being it only deadens in us the sense of the infinite.

A great poem, when analysed, is a set of detached sounds. The reader who
finds out the meaning, which is the inner medium that connects these
outer sounds, discovers a perfect law all through, which is never
violated in the least; the law of the evolution of ideas, the law of the
music and the form.

But law in itself is a limit. It only shows that whatever is can never
be otherwise. When a man is exclusively occupied with the search for the
links of causality, his mind succumbs to the tyranny of law in escaping
from the tyranny of facts. In learning a language, when from mere words
we reach the laws of words we have gained a great deal. But if we stop
at that point, and only concern ourselves with the marvels of the
formation of a language, seeking the hidden reason of all its apparent
caprices, we do not reach the end--for grammar is not literature,
prosody is not a poem.

When we come to literature we find that though it conforms to rules of
grammar it is yet a thing of joy, it is freedom itself. The beauty of a
poem is bound by strict laws, yet it transcends them. The laws are its
wings, they do not keep it weighed down, they carry it to freedom. Its
form is in law but its spirit is in beauty. Law is the first step
towards freedom, and beauty is the complete liberation which stands on
the pedestal of law. Beauty harmonises in itself the limit and the
beyond, the law and the liberty.

In the world-poem, the discovery of the law of its rhythms, the
measurement of its expansion and contraction, movement and pause, the
pursuit of its evolution of forms and characters, are true achievements
of the mind; but we cannot stop there. It is like a railway station; but
the station platform is not our home. Only he has attained the final
truth who knows that the whole world is a creation of joy.

This leads me to think how mysterious the relation of the human heart
with nature must be. In the outer world of activity nature has one
aspect, but in our hearts, in the inner world, it presents an altogether
different picture.

Take an instance--the flower of a plant. However fine and dainty it may
look, it is pressed to do a great service, and its colours and forms are
all suited to its work. It must bring forth the fruit, or the continuity
of plant life will be broken and the earth will be turned into a desert
ere long. The colour and the smell of the flower are all for some
purpose therefore; no sooner is it fertilised by the bee, and the time
of its fruition arrives, than it sheds its exquisite petals and a cruel
economy compels it to give up its sweet perfume. It has no time to
flaunt its finery, for it is busy beyond measure. Viewed from without,
necessity seems to be the only factor in nature for which everything
works and moves. There the bud develops into the flower, the flower into
the fruit, the fruit into the seed, the seed into a new plant again, and
so forth, the chain of activity running on unbroken. Should there crop
up any disturbance or impediment, no excuse would be accepted, and the
unfortunate thing thus choked in its movement would at once be labelled
as rejected, and be bound to die and disappear post- haste. In the great
office of nature there are innumerable departments with endless work
going on, and the fine flower that you behold there, gaudily attired and
scented like a dandy, is by no means what it appears to be, but rather,
is like a labourer toiling in sun and shower, who has to submit a clear
account of his work and has no breathing space to enjoy himself in
playful frolic.

But when this same flower enters the heart of men its aspect of busy
practicality is gone, and it becomes the very emblem of leisure and
repose. The same object that is the embodiment of endless activity
without is the perfect expression of beauty and peace within.

Science here warns us that we are mistaken, that the purpose of a flower
is nothing but what is outwardly manifested, and that the relation of
beauty and sweetness which we think it bears to us is all our own
making, gratuitous and imaginary.

But our heart replies that we are not in the least mistaken. In the
sphere of nature the flower carries with it a certificate which
recommends it as having immense capacity for doing useful work, but it
brings an altogether different letter of introduction when it knocks at
the door of our hearts. Beauty becomes its only qualification. At one
place it comes as a slave, and at another as a free thing. How, then,
should we give credit to its first recommendation and disbelieve the
second one? That the flower has got its being in the unbroken chain of
causation is true beyond doubt; but that is an outer truth. The inner
truth is: *Verily from the everlasting joy do all objects have their
birth.*  <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md)

A flower, therefore, has not its only function in nature, but has
another great function to exercise in the mind of man. And what is that
function? In nature its work is that of a servant who has to make his
appearance at appointed times, but in the heart of man it comes like a
messenger from the King. In the *Rāmāyana*, when *Sītā,* forcibly
separated from her husband, was bewailing her evil fate in *Ravana's*
golden palace, she was met by a messenger who brought with him a ring of
her beloved *Rāmachandra* himself. The very sight of it convinced *Sītā*
of the truth of tidings he bore. She was at once reassured that he came
indeed from her beloved one, who had not forgotten her and was at hand
to rescue her.

Such a messenger is a flower from our great lover. Surrounded with the
pomp and pageantry of worldliness, which may be linked to Ravana's
golden city, we still live in exile, while the insolent spirit of
worldly prosperity tempts us with allurements and claims us as its
bride. In the meantime the flower comes across with a message from the
other shore, and whispers in our ears, "I am come. He has sent me. I am
a messenger of the beautiful, the one whose soul is the bliss of love.
This island of isolation has been bridged over by him, and he has not
forgotten thee, and will rescue thee even now. He will draw thee unto
him and make thee his own. This illusion will not hold thee in thraldom
for ever."

If we happen to be awake then, we question him: "How are we to know that
thou art come from him indeed?" The messenger says, "Look! I have this
ring from him. How lovely are its hues and charms!"

Ah, doubtless it is his--indeed, it is our wedding ring. Now all else
passes into oblivion, only this sweet symbol of the touch of the eternal
love fills us with a deep longing. We realise that the palace of gold
where we are has nothing to do with us--our deliverance is outside
it--and there our love has its fruition and our life its fulfilment.

What to the bee in nature is merely colour and scent, and the marks or
spots which show the right track to the honey, is to the human heart
beauty and joy untrammelled by necessity. They bring a love letter to
the heart written in many-coloured inks.

I was telling you, therefore, that however busy our active nature
outwardly may be, she has a secret chamber within the heart where she
comes and goes freely, without any design whatsoever. There the fire of
her workshop is transformed into lamps of a festival, the noise of her
factory is heard like music. The iron chain of cause and effect sounds
heavily outside in nature, but in the human heart its unalloyed delight
seems to sound, as it were, like the golden strings of a harp.

It indeed seems to be wonderful that nature has these two aspects at one
and the same time, and so antithetical--one being of thraldom and the
other of freedom. In the same form, sound, colour, and taste two
contrary notes are heard, one of necessity and the other of joy.
Outwardly nature is busy and restless, inwardly she is all silence and
peace. She has toil on one side and leisure on the other. You see her
bondage only when you see her from without, but within her heart is a
limitless beauty.

Our seer says, "From joy are born all creatures, by joy they are
sustained, towards joy they progress, and into joy they enter."

Not that he ignores law, or that his contemplation of this infinite joy
is born of the intoxication produced by an indulgence in abstract
thought. He fully recognises the inexorable laws of nature, and says,
"Fire burns for fear of him (i.e. by his law); the sun shines by fear of
him; and for fear of him the wind, the clouds, and death perform their
offices." It is a reign of iron rule, ready to punish the least
transgression. Yet the poet chants the glad song, "From joy are born all
creatures, by joy they are sustained, towards joy they progress, and
into joy they enter."

*The immortal being manifests himself in joy-form.*  <span
id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) His manifestation in creation is out of
his fullness of joy. It is the nature of this abounding joy to realise
itself in form which is law. The joy, which is without form, must
create, must translate itself into forms. The joy of the singer is
expressed in the form of a song, that of the poet in the form of a poem.
Man in his rôle of a creator is ever creating forms, and they come out
of his abounding joy.

This joy, whose other name is love, must by its very nature have duality
for its realisation. When the singer has his inspiration he makes
himself into two; he has within him his other self as the hearer, and
the outside audience is merely an extension of this other self of his.
The lover seeks his own other self in his beloved. It is the joy that
creates this separation, in order to realise through obstacles of union.

The *amritam*, the immortal bliss, has made himself into two. Our soul
is the loved one, it is his other self. We are separate; but if this
separation were absolute, then there would have been absolute misery and
unmitigated evil in this world. Then from untruth we never could reach
truth, and from sin we never could hope to attain purity of heart; then
all opposites would ever remain opposites, and we could never find a
medium through which our differences could ever tend to meet. Then we
could have no language, no understanding, no blending of hearts, no
co-operation in life. But on the contrary, we find that the separateness
of objects is in a fluid state. Their individualities are even changing,
they are meeting and merging into each other, till science itself is
turning into metaphysics, matter losing its boundaries, and the
definition of life becoming more and more indefinite.

Yes, our individual soul has been separated from the supreme soul, but
this has not been from alienation but from the fullness of love. It is
for that reason that untruths, sufferings, and evils are not at a
standstill; the human soul can defy them, can overcome them, nay, can
altogether transform them into new power and beauty.

The singer is translating his song into singing, his joy into forms, and
the hearer has to translate back the singing into the original joy; then
the communion between the singer and the hearer is complete. The
infinite joy is manifesting itself in manifold forms, taking upon itself
the bondage of law, and we fulfil our destiny when we go back from forms
to joy, from law to the love, when we untie the knot of the finite and
hark back to the infinite.

The human soul is on its journey from the law to love, from discipline
to liberation, from the moral plane to the spiritual. Buddha preached
the discipline of self-restraint and moral life; it is a complete
acceptance of law. But this bondage of law cannot be an end by itself;
by mastering it thoroughly we acquire the means of getting beyond it. It
is going back to Brahma, to the infinite love, which is manifesting
itself through the finite forms of law. Buddha names it *Brahma-vihāra*,
the joy of living in Brahma. He who wants to reach this stage, according
to Buddha, "shall deceive none, entertain no hatred for anybody, and
never wish to injure through anger. He shall have measureless love for
all creatures, even as a mother has for her only child, whom she
protects with her own life. Up above, below, and all around him he shall
extend his love, which is without bounds and obstacles, and which is
free from all cruelty and antagonism. While standing, sitting, walking,
lying down, till he fall asleep, he shall keep his mind active in this
exercise of universal goodwill."

Want of love is a degree of callousness; for love is the perfection of
consciousness. We do not love because we do not comprehend, or rather we
do not comprehend because we do not love. For love is the ultimate
meaning of everything around us. It is not a mere sentiment; it is
truth; it is the joy that is at the root of all creation. It is the
white light of pure consciousness that emanates from Brahma. So, to be
one with this *sarvānubhūh*, this all-feeling being who is in the
external sky, as well as in our inner soul, we must attain to that
summit of consciousness, which is love: *Who could have breathed or
moved if the sky were not filled with joy, with love?*  <span
id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) It is through the heightening of our
consciousness into love, and extending it all over the world, that we
can attain *Brahma-vihāra,* communion with this infinite joy.

Love spontaneously gives itself in endless gifts. But these gifts lose
their fullest significance if through them we do not reach that love,
which is the giver. To do that, we must have love in our own heart. He
who has no love in him values the gifts of his lover only according to
their usefulness. But utility is temporary and partial. It can never
occupy our whole being; what is useful only touches us at the point
where we have some want. When the want is satisfied, utility becomes a
burden if it still persists. On the other hand, a mere token is of
permanent worth to us when we have love in our heart. For it is not for
any special use. It is an end in itself; it is for our whole being and
therefore can never tire us.

The question is, In what manner do we accept this world, which is a
perfect gift of joy? Have we been able to receive it in our heart where
we keep enshrined things that are of deathless value to us? We are
frantically busy making use of the forces of the universe to gain more
and more power; we feed and we clothe ourselves from its stores, we
scramble for its riches, and it becomes for us a field of fierce
competition. But were we born for this, to extend our proprietary rights
over this world and make of it a marketable commodity? When our whole
mind is bent only upon making use of this world it loses for us its true
value. We make it cheap by our sordid desires; and thus to the end of
our days we only try to feed upon it and miss its truth, just like the
greedy child who tears leaves from a precious book and tries to swallow
them.

In the lands where cannibalism is prevalent man looks upon man as his
food. In such a country civilisation can never thrive, for there man
loses his higher value and is made common indeed. But there are other
kinds of cannibalism, perhaps not so gross, but not less heinous, for
which one need not travel far. In countries higher in the scale of
civilisation we find sometimes man looked upon as a mere body, and he is
bought and sold in the market by the price of his flesh only. And
sometimes he gets his sole value from being useful; he is made into a
machine, and is traded upon by the man of money to acquire for him more
money. Thus our lust, our greed, our love of comfort result in
cheapening man to his lowest value. It is self deception on a large
scale. Our desires blind us to the *truth* that there is in man, and
this is the greatest wrong done by ourselves to our own soul. It deadens
our consciousness, and is but a gradual method of spiritual suicide. It
produces ugly sores in the body of civilisation, gives rise to its
hovels and brothels, its vindictive penal codes, its cruel prison
systems, its organised method of exploiting foreign races to the extent
of permanently injuring them by depriving them of the discipline of
self- government and means of self-defence.

Of course man is useful to man, because his body is a marvellous machine
and his mind an organ of wonderful efficiency. But he is a spirit as
well, and this spirit is truly known only by love. When we define a man
by the market value of the service we can expect of him, we know him
imperfectly. With this limited knowledge of him it becomes easy for us
to be unjust to him and to entertain feelings of triumphant
self-congratulation when, on account of some cruel advantage on our
side, we can get out of him much more than we have paid for. But when we
know him as a spirit we know him as our own. We at once feel that
cruelty to him is cruelty to ourselves, to make him small is stealing
from our own humanity, and in seeking to make use of him solely for
personal profit we merely gain in money or comfort what we pay in truth.

One day I was out in a boat on the Ganges. It was a beautiful evening in
autumn. The sun had just set; the silence of the sky was full to the
brim with ineffable peace and beauty. The vast expanse of water was
without a ripple, mirroring all the changing shades of the sunset glow.
Miles and miles of a desolate sandbank lay like a huge amphibious
reptile of some antediluvian age, with its scales glistening in shining
colours. As our boat was silently gliding by the precipitous river-bank,
riddled with the nest-holes of a colony of birds, suddenly a big fish
leapt up to the surface of the water and then disappeared, displaying on
its vanishing figure all the colours of the evening sky. It drew aside
for a moment the many-coloured screen behind which there was a silent
world full of the joy of life. It came up from the depths of its
mysterious dwelling with a beautiful dancing motion and added its own
music to the silent symphony of the dying day. I felt as if I had a
friendly greeting from an alien world in its own language, and it
touched my heart with a flash of gladness. Then suddenly the man at the
helm exclaimed with a distinct note of regret, "Ah, what a big fish!" It
at once brought before his vision the picture of the fish caught and
made ready for his supper. He could only look at the fish through his
desire, and thus missed the whole truth of its existence. But man is not
entirely an animal. He aspires to a spiritual vision, which is the
vision of the whole truth. This gives him the highest delight, because
it reveals to him the deepest harmony that exists between him and his
surroundings. It is our desires that limit the scope of our
self-realisation, hinder our extension of consciousness, and give rise
to sin, which is the innermost barrier that keeps us apart from our God,
setting up disunion and the arrogance of exclusiveness. For sin is not
one mere action, but it is an attitude of life which takes for granted
that our goal is finite, that our self is the ultimate truth, and that
we are not all essentially one but exist each for his own separate
individual existence.

So I repeat we never can have a true view of man unless we have a love
for him. Civilisation must be judged and prized, not by the amount of
power it has developed, but by how much it has evolved and given
expression to, by its laws and institutions, the love of humanity. The
first question and the last which it has to answer is, Whether and how
far it recognises man more as a spirit than a machine? Whenever some
ancient civilisation fell into decay and died, it was owing to causes
which produced callousness of heart and led to the cheapening of man's
worth; when either the state or some powerful group of men began to look
upon the people as a mere instrument of their power; when, by compelling
weaker races to slavery and trying to keep them down by every means, man
struck at the foundation of his greatness, his own love of freedom and
fair-play. Civilisation can never sustain itself upon cannibalism of any
form. For that by which alone man is true can only be nourished by love
and justice.

As with man, so with this universe. When we look at the world through
the veil of our desires we make it small and narrow, and fail to
perceive its full truth. Of course it is obvious that the world serves
us and fulfils our needs, but our relation to it does not end there. We
are bound to it with a deeper and truer bond than that of necessity. Our
soul is drawn to it; our love of life is really our wish to continue our
relation with this great world. This relation is one of love. We are
glad that we are in it; we are attached to it with numberless threads,
which extend from this earth to the stars. Man foolishly tries to prove
his superiority by imagining his radical separateness from what he calls
his physical world, which, in his blind fanaticism, he sometimes goes to
the extent of ignoring altogether, holding it at his direst enemy. Yet
the more his knowledge progresses, the more it becomes difficult for man
to establish this separateness, and all the imaginary boundaries he had
set up around himself vanish one after another. Every time we lose some
of our badges of absolute distinction by which we conferred upon our
humanity the right to hold itself apart from its surroundings, it gives
us a shock of humiliation. But we have to submit to this. If we set up
our pride on the path of our self-realisation to create divisions and
disunion, then it must sooner or later come under the wheels of truth
and be ground to dust. No, we are not burdened with some monstrous
superiority, unmeaning in its singular abruptness. It would be utterly
degrading for us to live in a world immeasurably less than ourselves in
the quality of soul, just as it would be repulsive and degrading to be
surrounded and served by a host of slaves, day and night, from birth to
the moment of death. On the contrary, this world is our compeer, nay, we
are one with it.

Through our progress in science the wholeness of the world and our
oneness with it is becoming clearer to our mind. When this perception of
the perfection of unity is not merely intellectual, when it opens out
our whole being into a luminous consciousness of the all, then it
becomes a radiant joy, an overspreading love. Our spirit finds its
larger self in the whole world, and is filled with an absolute certainty
that it is immortal. It dies a hundred times in its enclosures of self;
for separateness is doomed to die, it cannot be made eternal. But it
never can die where it is one with the all, for there is its truth, its
joy. When a man feels the rhythmic throb of the soul-life of the whole
world in his own soul, then is he free. Then he enters into the secret
courting that goes on between this beautiful world-bride, veiled with
the veil of the many-coloured finiteness, and the *paramatmam*, the
bridegroom, in his spotless white. Then he knows that he is the partaker
of this gorgeous love festival, and he is the honoured guest at the
feast of immortality. Then he understands the meaning of the seer-poet
who sings, "From love the world is born, by love it is sustained,
towards love it moves, and into love it enters."

In love all the contradictions of existence merge themselves and are
lost. Only in love are unity and duality not at variance. Love must be
one and two at the same time.

Only love is motion and rest in one. Our heart ever changes its place
till it finds love, and then it has its rest. But this rest itself is an
intense form of activity where utter quiescence and unceasing energy
meet at the same point in love.

In love, loss and gain are harmonised. In its balance-sheet, credit and
debit accounts are in the same column, and gifts are added to gains. In
this wonderful festival of creation, this great ceremony of
self-sacrifice of God, the lover constantly gives himself up to gain
himself in love. Indeed, love is what brings together and inseparably
connects both the act of abandoning and that of receiving.

In love, at one of its poles you find the personal, and at the other the
impersonal. At one you have the positive assertion-- Here I am; at the
other the equally strong denial--I am not. Without this ego what is
love? And again, with only this ego how can love be possible?

Bondage and liberation are not antagonistic in love. For love is most
free and at the same time most bound. If God were absolutely free there
would be no creation. The infinite being has assumed unto himself the
mystery of finitude. And in him who is love the finite and the infinite
are made one.

Similarly, when we talk about the relative values of freedom and
non-freedom, it becomes a mere play of words. It is not that we desire
freedom alone, we want thraldom as well. It is the high function of love
to welcome all limitations and to transcend them. For nothing is more
independent than love, and where else, again, shall we find so much of
dependence? In love, thraldom is as glorious as freedom.

The *Vaishnava* religion has boldly declared that God has bound himself
to man, and in that consists the greatest glory of human existence. In
the spell of the wonderful rhythm of the finite he fetters himself at
every step, and thus gives his love out in music in his most perfect
lyrics of beauty. Beauty is his wooing of our heart; it can have no
other purpose. It tells us everywhere that the display of power is not
the ultimate meaning of creation; wherever there is a bit of colour, a
note of song, a grace of form, there comes the call for our love. Hunger
compels us to obey its behests, but hunger is not the last word for a
man. There have been men who have deliberately defied its commands to
show that the human soul is not to be led by the pressure of wants and
threat of pain. In fact, to live the life of man we have to resist its
demands every day, the least of us as well as the greatest. But, on the
other hand, there is a beauty in the world which never insults our
freedom, never raises even its little finger to make us acknowledge its
sovereignty. We can absolutely ignore it and suffer no penalty in
consequence. It is a call to us, but not a command. It seeks for love in
us, and love can never be had by compulsion. Compulsion is not indeed
the final appeal to man, but joy is. Any joy is everywhere; it is in the
earth's green covering of grass; in the blue serenity of the sky; in the
reckless exuberance of spring; in the severe abstinence of grey winter;
in the living flesh that animates our bodily frame; in the perfect poise
of the human figure, noble and upright; in living; in the exercise of
all our powers; in the acquisition of knowledge; in fighting evils; in
dying for gains we never can share. Joy is there everywhere; it is
superfluous, unnecessary; nay, it very often contradicts the most
peremptory behests of necessity. It exists to show that the bonds of law
can only be explained by love; they are like body and soul. Joy is the
realisation of the truth of oneness, the oneness of our soul with the
world and of the world-soul with the supreme lover.
