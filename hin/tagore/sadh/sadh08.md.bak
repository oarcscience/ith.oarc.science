VI

REALISATION IN ACTION

It is only those who have known that joy expresses itself through law
who have learnt to transcend the law. Not that the bonds of law have
ceased to exist for them--but that the bonds have become to them as the
form of freedom incarnate. The freed soul delights in accepting bonds,
and does not seek to evade any of them, for in each does it feel the
manifestation of an infinite energy whose joy is in creation.

As a matter of fact, where there are no bonds, where there is the
madness of license, the soul ceases to be free. There is its hurt; there
is its separation from the infinite, its agony of sin. Whenever at the
call of temptation the soul falls away from the bondage of law, then,
like a child deprived of the support of its mother's arms, it cries out,
*Smite me not!*  <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) "Bind me," it
prays, "oh, bind me in the bonds of thy law; bind me within and without;
hold me tight; let me in the clasp of thy law be bound up together with
thy joy; protect me by thy firm hold from the deadly laxity of sin."

As some, under the idea that law is the opposite of joy, mistake
intoxication for joy, so there are many in our country who imagine
action to be opposed to freedom. They think that activity being in the
material plane is a restriction of the free spirit of the soul. But we
must remember that as joy expresses itself in law, so the soul finds its
freedom in action. It is because joy cannot find expression in itself
alone that it desires the law which is outside. Likewise it is because
the soul cannot find freedom within itself that it wants external
action. The soul of man is ever freeing itself from its own folds by its
activity; had it been otherwise it could not have done any voluntary
work.

The more man acts and makes actual what was latent in him, the nearer
does he bring the distant Yet-to-be. In that actualisation man is ever
making himself more and yet more distinct, and seeing himself clearly
under newer and newer aspects in the midst of his varied activities, in
the state, in society. This vision makes for freedom.

Freedom is not in darkness, nor in vagueness. There is no bondage so
fearful as that of obscurity. It is to escape from this obscurity that
the seed struggles to sprout, the bud to blossom. It is to rid itself of
this envelope of vagueness that the ideas in our mind are constantly
seeking opportunities to take on outward form. In the same way our soul,
in order to release itself from the mist of indistinctness and come out
into the open, is continually creating for itself fresh fields of
action, and is busy contriving new forms of activity, even such as are
not needful for the purposes of its earthly life. And why? Because it
wants freedom. It wants to see itself, to realise itself.

When man cuts down the pestilential jungle and makes unto himself a
garden, the beauty that he thus sets free from within its enclosure of
ugliness is the beauty of his own soul: without giving it this freedom
outside, he cannot make it free within. When he implants law and order
in the midst of the waywardness of society, the good which he sets free
from the obstruction of the bad is the goodness of his own soul: without
being thus made free outside it cannot find freedom within. Thus is man
continually engaged in setting free in action his powers, his beauty,
his goodness, his very soul. And the more he succeeds in so doing, the
greater does he see himself to be, the broader becomes the field of his
knowledge of self.

The Upanishad says: *In the midst of activity alone wilt thou desire to
live a hundred years.*  <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) It is the
saying of those who had amply tasted of the joy of the soul. Those who
have fully realised the soul have never talked in mournful accents of
the sorrowfulness of life or of the bondage of action. They are not like
the weakling flower whose stem-hold is so light that it drops away
before attaining fruition. They hold on to life with all their might and
say, "never will we let go till the fruit is ripe." They desire in their
joy to express themselves strenuously in their life and in their work.
Pain and sorrow dismay them not, they are not bowed down to the dust by
the weight of their own heart. With the erect head of the victorious
hero they march through life seeing themselves and showing themselves in
increasing resplendence of soul through both joys and sorrows. The joy
of their life keeps step with the joy of that energy which is playing at
building and breaking throughout the universe. The joy of the sunlight,
the joy of the free air, mingling with the joy of their lives, makes one
sweet harmony reign within and without. It is they who say, *In the
midst of activity alone wilt thou desire to live a hundred years.*

This joy of life, this joy of work, in man is absolutely true. It is no
use saying that it is a delusion of ours; that unless we cast it away we
cannot enter upon the path of self-realisation. It will never do the
least good to attempt the realisation of the infinite apart from the
world of action.

It is not the truth that man is active on compulsion. If there is
compulsion on one side, on the other there is pleasure; on the one hand
action is spurred on by want, on the other it hies to its natural
fulfilment. That is why, as man's civilisation advances, he increases
his obligations and the work that he willingly creates for himself. One
should have thought that nature had given him quite enough to do to keep
him busy, in fact that it was working him to death with the lash of
hunger and thirst,--but no. Man does not think that sufficient; he
cannot rest content with only doing the work that nature prescribes for
him in common with the birds and beasts. He needs must surpass all, even
in activity. No creature has to work so hard as man; he has been
impelled to contrive for himself a vast field of action in society; and
in this field he is for every building up and pulling down, making and
unmaking laws, piling up heaps of material, and incessantly thinking,
seeking and suffering. In this field he has fought his mightiest
battles, gained continual new life, made death glorious, and, far from
evading troubles, has willingly and continually taken up the burden of
fresh trouble. He has discovered the truth that he is not complete in
the cage of his immediate surroundings, that he is greater than his
present, and that while to stand still in one place may be comforting,
the arrest of life destroys his true function and the real purpose of
his existence.

This *mahatī vinashtih--this great destruction* he cannot bear, and
accordingly he toils and suffers in order that he may gain in stature by
transcending his present, in order to become that which he yet is not.
In this travail is man's glory, and it is because he knows it, that he
has not sought to circumscribe his field of action, but is constantly
occupied in extending the bounds. Sometimes he wanders so far that his
work tends to lose its meaning, and his rushings to and fro create
fearful eddies round different centres--eddies of self-interest, of
pride of power. Still, so long as the strength of the current is not
lost, there is no fear; the obstructions and the dead accumulations of
his activity are dissipated and carried away; the impetus corrects its
own mistakes. Only when the soul sleeps in stagnation do its enemies
gain overmastering strength, and these obstructions become too clogging
to be fought through. Hence have we been warned by our teachers that to
work we must live, to live we must work; that life and activity are
inseparably connected.

It is very characteristic of life that it is not complete within itself;
it must come out. Its truth is in the commerce of the inside and the
outside. In order to live, the body must maintain its various relations
with the outside light and air--not only to gain life-force, but also to
manifest it. Consider how fully employed the body is with its own inside
activities; its heart- beat must not stop for a second, its stomach, its
brain, must be ceaselessly working. Yet this is not enough; the body is
outwardly restless all the while. Its life leads it to an endless dance
of work and play outside; it cannot be satisfied with the circulations
of its internal economy, and only finds the fulfilment of joy in its
outward excursions.

The same with the soul. It cannot live on its own internal feelings and
imaginings. It is ever in need of external objects; not only to feed its
inner consciousness but to apply itself in action, not only to receive
but also to give.

The real truth is, we cannot live if we divide him who is truth itself
into two parts. We must abide in him within as well as without. In
whichever aspect we deny him we deceive ourselves and incur a loss.
*Brahma has not left me, let me not leave Brahma.*  <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) If we say that we would realise him in
introspection alone and leave him out of our external activity, that we
would enjoy him by the love in our heart, but not worship him by outward
ministrations; or if we say the opposite, and overweight ourselves on
one side in the journey of our life's quest, we shall alike totter to
our downfall.

In the great western continent we see that the soul of man is mainly
concerned with extending itself outwards; the open field of the exercise
of power is its field. Its partiality is entirely for the world of
extension, and it would leave aside-- nay, hardly believe in--that field
of inner consciousness which is the field of fulfilment. It has gone so
far in this that the perfection of fulfilment seems to exist for it
nowhere. Its science has always talked of the never-ending evolution of
the world. Its metaphysic has now begun to talk of the evolution of God
himself. They will not admit that he *is*; they would have it that he
also is *becoming.*

They fail to realise that while the infinite is always greater than any
assignable limit, it is also complete; that on the one hand Brahma is
evolving, on the other he is perfection; that in the one aspect he is
essence, in the other manifestation--both together at the same time, as
is the song and the act of singing. This is like ignoring the
consciousness of the singer and saying that only the singing is in
progress, that there is no song. Doubtless we are directly aware only of
the singing, and never at any one time of the song as a whole; but do we
not all the time know that the complete song is in the soul of the
singer?

It is because of this insistence on the doing and the becoming that we
perceive in the west the intoxication of power. These men seem to have
determined to despoil and grasp everything by force. They would always
obstinately be doing and never be done-- they would not allow to death
its natural place in the scheme of things--they know not the beauty of
completion.

In our country the danger comes from the opposite side. Our partiality
is for the internal world. We would cast aside with contumely the field
of power and of extension. We would realise Brahma in mediation only in
his aspect of completeness, we have determined not to see him in the
commerce of the universe in his aspect of evolution. That is why in our
seekers we so often find the intoxication of the spirit and its
consequent degradation. Their faith would acknowledge no bondage of law,
their imagination soars unrestricted, their conduct disdains to offer
any explanation to reason. Their intellect, in its vain attempts to see
Brahma inseparable from his creation, works itself stone- dry, and their
heart, seeking to confine him within its own outpourings, swoons in a
drunken ecstasy of emotion. They have not even kept within reach any
standard whereby they can measure the loss of strength and character
which manhood sustains by thus ignoring the bonds of law and the claims
of action in the external universe.

But true spirituality, as taught in our sacred lore, is calmly balanced
in strength, in the correlation of the within and the without. The truth
has its law, it has its joy. On one side of it is being chanted the
*Bhayādasyāgnistapati*  <span id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) , on the
other the *Ānandādhyeva khalvimāni bhūtāni jāyante.*  <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) Freedom is impossible of attainment
without submission to law, for Brahma is in one aspect bound by his
truth, in the other free in his joy.

As for ourselves, it is only when we wholly submit to the bonds of truth
that we fully gain the joy of freedom. And how? As does the string that
is bound to the harp. When the harp is truly strung, when there is not
the slightest laxity in the strength of the bond, then only does music
result; and the string transcending itself in its melody finds at every
chord its true freedom. It is because it is bound by such hard and fast
rules on the one side that it can find this range of freedom in music on
the other. While the string was not true, it was indeed merely bound;
but a loosening of its bondage would not have been the way to freedom,
which it can only fully achieve by being bound tighter and tighter till
it has attained the true pitch.

The bass and treble strings of our duty are only bonds so long as we
cannot maintain them steadfastly attuned according to the law of truth;
and we cannot call by the name of freedom the loosening of them into the
nothingness of inaction. That is why I would say that the true striving
in the quest of truth, of *dharma*, consists not in the neglect of
action but in the effort to attune it closer and closer to the eternal
harmony. The text of this striving should be, *Whatever works thou
doest, consecrate them to Brahma.*  <span id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md)
That is to say, the soul is to dedicate itself to Brahma through all its
activities. This dedication is the song of the soul, in this is its
freedom. Joy reigns when all work becomes the path to the union with
Brahma; when the soul ceases to return constantly to its own desires;
when in it our self- offering grows more and more intense. Then there is
completion, then there is freedom, then, in this world, comes the
kingdom of God.

Who is there that, sitting in his corner, would deride this grand
self-expression of humanity in action, this incessant self-
consecration? Who is there that thinks the union of God and man is to be
found in some secluded enjoyment of his own imaginings, away from the
sky-towering temple of the greatness of humanity, which the whole of
mankind, in sunshine and storm, is toiling to erect through the ages?
Who is there that thinks this secluded communion is the highest form of
religion?

O thou distraught wanderer, thou *Sannyasin*, drunk in the wine of
self-intoxication, dost thou not already hear the progress of the human
soul along the highway traversing the wide fields of humanity--the
thunder of its progress in the car of its achievements, which is
destined to overpass the bounds that prevent its expansion into the
universe? The very mountains are cleft asunder and give way before the
march of its banners waving triumphantly in the heavens; as the mist
before the rising sun, the tangled obscurities of material things vanish
at its irresistible approach. Pain, disease, and disorder are at every
step receding before its onset; the obstructions of ignorance are being
thrust aside; the darkness of blindness is being pierced through; and
behold, the promised land of wealth and health, of poetry and art, of
knowledge and righteousness is gradually being revealed to view. Do you
in your lethargy desire to say that this car of humanity, which is
shaking the very earth with the triumph of its progress along the mighty
vistas of history, has no charioteer leading it on to its fulfilment?
Who is there who refuses to respond to his call to join in this
triumphal progress? Who so foolish as to run away from the gladsome
throng and seek him in the listlessness of inaction? Who so steeped in
untruth as to dare to call all this untrue--this great world of men,
this civilisation of expanding humanity, this eternal effort of man,
through depths of sorrow, through heights of gladness, through
innumerable impediments within and without, to win victory for his
powers? He who can think of this immensity of achievement as an immense
fraud, can he truly believe in God who is the truth? He who thinks to
reach God by running away from the world, when and where does he expect
to meet him? How far can he fly--can he fly and fly, till he flies into
nothingness itself? No, the coward who would fly can nowhere find him.
We must be brave enough to be able to say: We are reaching him here in
this very spot, now at this very moment. We must be able to assure
ourselves that as in our actions we are realising ourselves, so in
ourselves we are realising him who is the self of self. We must earn the
right to say so unhesitatingly by clearing away with our own effort all
obstruction, all disorder, all discords from our path of activity; we
must be able to say, "In my work is my joy, and in that joy does the joy
of my joy abide."

Whom does the Upanishad call *The chief among the knowers of Brahma?*
 <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) He is defined as *He whose joy is
in Brahma, whose play is in Brahma, the active one.*  <span
id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) Joy without the play of joy is no joy at
all--play without activity is no play. Activity is the play of joy. He
whose joy is in Brahma, how can he live in inaction? For must he not by
his activity provide that in which the joy of Brahma is to take form and
manifest itself? That is why he who knows Brahma, who has his joy in
Brahma, must also have all his activity in Brahma--his eating and
drinking, his earning of livelihood and his beneficence. Just as the joy
of the poet in his poem, of the artist in his art, of the brave man in
the output of his courage, of the wise man in his discernment of truths,
ever seeks expression in their several activities, so the joy of the
knower of Brahma, in the whole of his everyday work, little and big, in
truth, in beauty, in orderliness and in beneficence, seeks to give
expression to the infinite.

Brahma himself gives expression to his joy in just the same way. *By his
many-sided activity, which radiates in all directions, does he fulfil
the inherent want of his different creatures.*  <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) That inherent want is he himself, and so
he is in so many ways, in so many forms, giving himself. He works, for
without working how could he give himself. His joy is ever dedicating
itself in the dedication which is his creation.

In this very thing does our own true meaning lie, in this is our
likeness to our father. We must also give up ourselves in many- sided
variously aimed activity. In the Vedas he is called *the giver of
himself, the giver of strength.*  <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md)
He is not content with giving us himself, but he gives us strength that
we may likewise give ourselves. That is why the seer of the Upanishad
prays to him who is thus fulfilling our wants, *May he grant us the
beneficent mind*  <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) , may he fulfil
that uttermost want of ours by granting us the beneficent mind. That is
to say, it is not enough he should alone work to remove our want, but he
should give us the desire and the strength to work with him in his
activity and in the exercise of the goodness. Then, indeed, will our
union with him alone be accomplished. The beneficent mind is that which
shows us the want (*swārtha*) of another self to be the inherent want
(*nihitārtha*) of our own self; that which shows that our joy consists
in the varied aiming of our many-sided powers in the work of humanity.
When we work under the guidance of this beneficent mind, then our
activity is regulated, but does not become mechanical; it is action not
goaded on by want, but stimulated by the satisfaction of the soul. Such
activity ceases to be a blind imitation of that of the multitude, a
cowardly following of the dictates of fashion. Therein we begin to see
that *He is in the beginning and in the end of the universe*  <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) , and likewise see that of our own work
is he the fount and the inspiration, and at the end thereof is he, and
therefore that all our activity is pervaded by peace and good and joy.

The Upanishad says: *Knowledge, power, and action are of his nature.*
 <span id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) It is because this naturalness has
not yet been born in us that we tend to divide joy from work. Our day of
work is not our day of joy-- for that we require a holiday; for,
miserable that we are, we cannot find our holiday in our work. The river
finds its holiday in its onward flow, the fire in its outburst of flame,
the scent of the flower in its permeation of the atmosphere; but in our
everyday work there is no such holiday for us. It is because we do not
let ourselves go, because we do not give ourselves joyously and entirely
up to it, that our work overpowers us.

O giver of thyself! at the vision of thee as joy let our souls flame up
to thee as the fire, flow on to thee as the river, permeate thy being as
the fragrance of the flower. Give us strength to love, to love fully,
our life in its joys and sorrows, in its gains and losses, in its rise
and fall. Let us have strength enough fully to see and hear thy
universe, and to work with full vigour therein. Let us fully live the
life thou hast given us, let us bravely take and bravely give. This is
our prayer to thee. Let us once for all dislodge from our minds the
feeble fancy that would make out thy joy to be a thing apart from
action, thin, formless, and unsustained. Wherever the peasant tills the
hard earth, there does thy joy gush out in the green of the corn,
wherever man displaces the entangled forest, smooths the stony ground,
and clears for himself a homestead, there does thy joy enfold it in
orderliness and peace.

O worker of the universe! We would pray to thee to let the irresistible
current of thy universal energy come like the impetuous south wind of
spring, let it come rushing over the vast field of the life of man, let
it bring the scent of many flowers, the murmurings of many woodlands,
let it make sweet and vocal the lifelessness of our dried-up soul-life.
Let our newly awakened powers cry out for unlimited fulfilment in leaf
and flower and fruit.
