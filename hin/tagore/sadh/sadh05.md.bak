THE PROBLEM OF EVIL

The question why there is evil in existence is the same as why there is
imperfection, or, in other words, why there is creation at all. We must
take it for granted that it could not be otherwise; that creation must
be imperfect, must be gradual, and that it is futile to ask the
question, Why we are?

But this is the real question we ought to ask: Is this imperfection the
final truth, is evil absolute and ultimate? The river has its
boundaries, its banks, but is a river all banks? or are the banks the
final facts about the river? Do not these obstructions themselves give
its water an onward motion? The towing rope binds a boat, but is the
bondage its meaning? Does it not at the same time draw the boat forward?

The current of the world has its boundaries, otherwise it could have no
existence, but its purpose is not shown in the boundaries which restrain
it, but in its movement, which is towards perfection. The wonder is not
that there should be obstacles and sufferings in this world, but that
there should be law and order, beauty and joy, goodness and love. The
idea of God that man has in his being is the wonder of all wonders. He
has felt in the depths of his life that what appears as imperfect is the
manifestation of the perfect; just as a man who has an ear for music
realises the perfection of a song, while in fact he is only listening to
a succession of notes. Man has found out the great paradox that what is
limited is not imprisoned within its limits; it is ever moving, and
therewith shedding its finitude every moment. In fact, imperfection is
not a negation of perfectness; finitude is not contradictory to
infinity: they are but completeness manifested in parts, infinity
revealed within bounds.

Pain, which is the feeling of our finiteness, is not a fixture in our
life. It is not an end in itself, as joy is. To meet with it is to know
that it has no part in the true permanence of creation. It is what error
is in our intellectual life. To go through the history of the
development of science is to go through the maze of mistakes it made
current at different times. Yet no one really believes that science is
the one perfect mode of disseminating mistakes. The progressive
ascertainment of truth is the important thing to remember in the history
of science, not its innumerable mistakes. Error, by its nature, cannot
be stationary; it cannot remain with truth; like a tramp, it must quit
its lodging as soon as it fails to pay its score to the full.

As in intellectual error, so in evil of any other form, its essence is
impermanence, for it cannot accord with the whole. Every moment it is
being corrected by the totality of things and keeps changing its aspect.
We exaggerate its importance by imagining it as a standstill. Could we
collect the statistics of the immense amount of death and putrefaction
happening every moment in this earth, they would appal us. But evil is
ever moving; with all its incalculable immensity it does not effectually
clog the current of our life; and we find that the earth, water, and air
remain sweet and pure for living beings. All statistics consist of our
attempts to represent statistically what is in motion; and in the
process things assume a weight in our mind which they have not in
reality. For this reason a man, who by his profession is concerned with
any particular aspect of life, is apt to magnify its proportions; in
laying undue stress upon facts he loses his hold upon truth. A detective
may have the opportunity of studying crimes in detail, but he loses his
sense of their relative places in the whole social economy. When science
collects facts to illustrate the struggle for existence that is going on
in the kingdom of life, it raises a picture in our minds of "nature red
in tooth and claw." But in these mental pictures we give a fixity to
colours and forms which are really evanescent. It is like calculating
the weight of the air on each square inch of our body to prove that it
must be crushingly heavy for us. With every weight, however, there is an
adjustment, and we lightly bear our burden. With the struggle for
existence in nature there is reciprocity. There is the love for children
and for comrades; there is the sacrifice of self, which springs from
love; and this love is the positive element in life.

If we kept the search-light of our observation turned upon the fact of
death, the world would appear to us like a huge charnel- house; but in
the world of life the thought of death has, we find, the least possible
hold upon our minds. Not because it is the least apparent, but because
it is the negative aspect of life; just as, in spite of the fact that we
shut our eyelids every second, it is the openings of the eye that count.
Life as a whole never takes death seriously. It laughs, dances and
plays, it builds, hoards and loves in death's face. Only when we detach
one individual fact of death do we see its blankness and become
dismayed. We lose sight of the wholeness of a life of which death is
part. It is like looking at a piece of cloth through a microscope. It
appears like a net; we gaze at the big holes and shiver in imagination.
But the truth is, death is not the ultimate reality. It looks black, as
the sky looks blue; but it does not blacken existence, just as the sky
does not leave its stain upon the wings of the bird.

When we watch a child trying to walk, we see its countless failures; its
successes are but few. If we had to limit our observation within a
narrow space of time, the sight would be cruel. But we find that in
spite of its repeated failures there is an impetus of joy in the child
which sustains it in its seemingly impossible task. We see it does not
think of its falls so much as of its power to keep its balance though
for only a moment.

Like these accidents in a child's attempts to walk, we meet with
sufferings in various forms in our life every day, showing the
imperfections in our knowledge and our available power, and in the
application of our will. But if these revealed our weakness to us only,
we should die of utter depression. When we select for observation a
limited area of our activities, our individual failures and miseries
loom large in our minds; but our life leads us instinctively to take a
wider view. It gives us an ideal of perfection which ever carries us
beyond our present limitations. Within us we have a hope which always
walks in front of our present narrow experience; it is the undying faith
in the infinite in us; it will never accept any of our disabilities as a
permanent fact; it sets no limit to its own scope; it dares to assert
that man has oneness with God; and its wild dreams become true every
day.

We see the truth when we set our mind towards the infinite. The ideal of
truth is not in the narrow present, not in our immediate sensations, but
in the consciousness of the whole which give us a taste of what we
*should* have in what we *do* have. Consciously or unconsciously we have
in our life this feeling of Truth which is ever larger than its
appearance; for our life is facing the infinite, and it is in movement.
Its aspiration is therefore infinitely more than its achievement, and as
it goes on it finds that no realisation of truth ever leaves it stranded
on the desert of finality, but carries it to a region beyond. Evil
cannot altogether arrest the course of life on the highway and rob it of
its possessions. For the evil has to pass on, it has to grow into good;
it cannot stand and give battle to the All. If the least evil could stop
anywhere indefinitely, it would sink deep and cut into the very roots of
existence. As it is, man does not really believe in evil, just as he
cannot believe that violin strings have been purposely made to create
the exquisite torture of discordant notes, though by the aid of
statistics it can be mathematically proved that the probability of
discord is far greater than that of harmony, and for one who can play
the violin there are thousands who cannot. The potentiality of
perfection outweighs actual contradictions. No doubt there have been
people who asserted existence to be an absolute evil, but man can never
take them seriously. Their pessimism is a mere pose, either intellectual
or sentimental; but life itself is optimistic: it wants to go on.
Pessimism is a form of mental dipsomania, it disdains healthy
nourishment, indulges in the strong drink of denunciation, and creates
an artificial dejection which thirsts for a stronger draught. If
existence were an evil, it would wait for no philosopher to prove it. It
is like convicting a man of suicide, while all the time he stands before
you in the flesh. Existence itself is here to prove that it cannot be an
evil.

An imperfection which is not all imperfection, but which has perfection
for its ideal, must go through a perpetual realisation. Thus, it is the
function of our intellect to realise the truth through untruths, and
knowledge is nothing but the continually burning up of error to set free
the light of truth. Our will, our character, has to attain perfection by
continually overcoming evils, either inside or outside us, or both; our
physical life is consuming bodily materials every moment to maintain the
life fire; and our moral life too has its fuel to burn. This life
process is going on--we know it, we have felt it; and we have a faith
which no individual instances to the contrary can shake, that the
direction of humanity is from evil to good. For we feel that good is the
positive element in man's nature, and in every age and every clime what
man values most is his ideals of goodness. We have known the good, we
have loved it, and we have paid our highest reverence to men who have
shown in their lives what goodness is.

The question will be asked, What is goodness; what does our moral nature
mean? My answer is, that when a man begins to have an extended vision of
his self, when he realises that he is much more than at present he seems
to be, he begins to get conscious of his moral nature. Then he grows
aware of that which he is yet to be, and the state not yet experienced
by him becomes more real than that under his direct experience.
Necessarily, his perspective of life changes, and his will takes the
place of his wishes. For will is the supreme wish of the larger life,
the life whose greater portion is out of our present reach, most of
whose objects are not before our sight. Then comes the conflict of our
lesser man with our greater man, of our wishes with our will, of the
desire for things affecting our senses with the purpose that is within
our heart. Then we begin to distinguish between what we immediately
desire and what is good. For good is that which is desirable for our
greater self. Thus the sense of goodness comes out of a truer view of
our life, which is the connected view of the wholeness of the field of
life, and which takes into account not only what is present before us
but what is not, and perhaps never humanly can be. Man, who is
provident, feels for that life of his which is not yet existent, feels
much more that than for the life that is with him; therefore he is ready
to sacrifice his present inclination for the unrealised future. In this
he becomes great, for he realises truth. Even to be efficiently selfish
one has to recognise this truth, and has to curb his immediate
impulses--in other words, has to be moral. For our moral faculty is the
faculty by which we know that life is not made up of fragments,
purposeless and discontinuous. This moral sense of man not only gives
him the power to see that the self has a continuity in time, but it also
enables him to see that he is not true when he is only restricted to his
own self. He is more in truth than he is in fact. He truly belongs to
individuals who are not included in his own individuality, and whom he
is never even likely to know. As he has a feeling for his future self
which is outside his present consciousness, so he has a feeling for his
greater self which is outside the limits of his personality. There is no
man who has not this feeling to some extent, who has never sacrificed
his selfish desire for the sake of some other person, who has never felt
a pleasure in undergoing some loss or trouble because it pleased
somebody else. It is a truth that man is not a detached being, that he
has a universal aspect; and when he recognises this he becomes great.
Even the most evilly-disposed selfishness has to recognise this when it
seeks the power to do evil; for it cannot ignore truth and yet be
strong. So in order to claim the aid of truth, selfishness has to be
unselfish to some extent. A band of robbers must be moral in order to
hold together as a band; they may rob the whole world but not each
other. To make an immoral intention successful, some of its weapons must
be moral. In fact, very often it is our very moral strength which gives
us most effectively the power to do evil, to exploit other individuals
for our own benefit, to rob other people of their rights. The life of an
animal is unmoral, for it is aware only of an immediate present; the
life of a man can be immoral, but that only means that it must have a
moral basis. What is immoral is imperfectly moral, just as what is false
is true to a small extent, or it cannot even be false. Not to see is to
be blind, but to see wrongly is to see only in an imperfect manner.
Man's selfishness is a beginning to see some connection, some purpose in
life; and to act in accordance with its dictates requires self-restraint
and regulation of conduct. A selfish man willingly undergoes troubles
for the sake of the self, he suffers hardship and privation without a
murmur, simply because he knows that what is pain and trouble, looked at
from the point of view of a short space of time, are just the opposite
when seen in a larger perspective. Thus what is a loss to the smaller
man is a gain to the greater, and *vice versa*.

To the man who lives for an idea, for his country, for the good of
humanity, life has an extensive meaning, and to that extent pain becomes
less important to him. To live the life of goodness is to live the life
of all. Pleasure is for one's own self, but goodness is concerned with
the happiness of all humanity and for all time. From the point of view
of the good, pleasure and pain appear in a different meaning; so much
so, that pleasure may be shunned, and pain be courted in its place, and
death itself be made welcome as giving a higher value to life. From
these higher standpoints of a man's life, the standpoints of the good,
pleasure and pain lose their absolute value. Martyrs prove it in
history, and we prove it every day in our life in our little martyrdoms.
When we take a pitcherful of water from the sea it has its weight, but
when we take a dip into the sea itself a thousand pitchersful of water
flow above our head, and we do not feel their weight. We have to carry
the pitcher of self with our strength; and so, while on the plane of
selfishness pleasure and pain have their full weight, on the moral plane
they are so much lightened that the man who has reached it appears to us
almost superhuman in his patience under crushing trails, and his
forbearance in the face of malignant persecution.

To live in perfect goodness is to realise one's life in the infinitive.
This is the most comprehensive view of life which we can have by our
inherent power of the moral vision of the wholeness of life. And the
teaching of Buddha is to cultivate this moral power to the highest
extent, to know that our field of activities is not bound to the plane
of our narrow self. This is the vision of the heavenly kingdom of
Christ. When we attain to that universal life, which is the moral life,
we become freed from the bonds of pleasure and pain, and the place
vacated by our self becomes filled with an unspeakable joy which springs
from measureless love. In this state the soul's activity is all the more
heightened, only its motive power is not from desires, but in its own
joy. This is the *Karma-yoga* of the *Gita*, the way to become one with
the infinite activity by the exercise of the activity of disinterested
goodness.

When Buddha mentioned upon the way of realising mankind from the grip of
misery he came to this truth: that when man attains his highest end by
merging the individual in the universal, he becomes free from the
thraldom of pain. Let us consider this point more fully.

A student of mine once related to me his adventure in a storm, and
complained that all the time he was troubled with the feeling that this
great commotion in nature behaved to him as if he were no more than a
mere handful of dust. That he was a distinct personality with a will of
his own had not the least influence upon what was happening.

I said, "If consideration for our individuality could sway nature from
her path, then it would be the individuals who would suffer most."

But he persisted in his doubt, saying that there was this fact which
could not be ignored--the feeling that I am. The "I" in us seeks for a
relation which is individual to it.

I replied that the relation of the "I" is with something which is
"not-I." So we must have a medium which is common to both, and we must
be absolutely certain that it is the same to the "I" as it is to the
"not-I."

This is what needs repeating here. We have to keep in mind that our
individuality by its nature is impelled to seek for the universal. Our
body can only die if it tries to eat its own substance, and our eye
loses the meaning of its function if it can only see itself.

Just as we find that the stronger the imagination the less is it merely
imaginary and the more is it in harmony with truth, so we see the more
vigorous our individuality the more does it widen towards the universal.
For the greatness of a personality is not in itself but in its content,
which is universal, just as the depth of a lake is judged not by the
size of its cavity but by the depth of its water.

So, if it is a truth that the yearning of our nature is for reality, and
that our personality cannot be happy with a fantastic universe of its
own creation, then it is clearly best for it that our will can only deal
with things by following their law, and cannot do with them just as it
pleases. This unyielding sureness of reality sometimes crosses our will,
and very often leads us to disaster, just as the firmness of the earth
invariably hurts the falling child who is learning to walk. Nevertheless
it is the same firmness that hurts him which makes his walking possible.
Once, while passing under a bridge, the mast of my boat got stuck in one
of its girders. If only for a moment the mast would have bent an inch or
two, or the bridge raised its back like a yawning cat, or the river
given in, it would have been all right with me. But they took no notice
of my helplessness. That is the very reason why I could make use of the
river, and sail upon it with the help of the mast, and that is why, when
its current was inconvenient, I could rely upon the bridge. Things are
what they are, and we have to know them if we would deal with them, and
knowledge of them is possible because our wish is not their law. This
knowledge is a joy to us, for the knowledge is one of the channels of
our relation with the things outside us; it is making them our own, and
thus widening the limit of our self.

At every step we have to take into account others than ourselves. For
only in death are we alone. A poet is a true poet when he can make his
personal idea joyful to all men, which he could not do if he had not a
medium common to all his audience. This common language has its own law
which the poet must discover and follow, by doing which he becomes true
and attains poetical immortality.

We see then that man's individuality is not his highest truth; there is
that in him which is universal. If he were made to live in a world where
his own self was the only factor to consider, then that would be the
worst prison imaginable to him, for man's deepest joy is in growing
greater and greater by more and more union with the all. This, as we
have seen, would be an impossibility if there were no law common to all.
Only by discovering the law and following it, do we become great, do we
realise the universal; while, so long as our individual desires are at
conflict with the universal law, we suffer pain and are futile.

There was a time when we prayed for special concessions, we expected
that the laws of nature should be held in abeyance for our own
convenience. But now we know better. We know that law cannot be set
aside, and in this knowledge we have become strong. For this law is not
something apart from us; it is our own. The universal power which is
manifested in the universal law is one with our own power. It will
thwart us where we are small, where we are against the current of
things; but it will help us where we are great, where we are in unison
with the all. Thus, through the help of science, as we come to know more
of the laws of nature, we gain in power; we tend to attain a universal
body. Our organ of sight, our organ of locomotion, our physical strength
becomes world-wide; steam and electricity become our nerve and muscle.
Thus we find that, just as throughout our bodily organisation there is a
principle of relation by virtue of which we can call the entire body our
own, and can use it as such, so all through the universe there is that
principle of uninterrupted relation by virtue of which we can call the
whole world our extended body and use it accordingly. And in this age of
science it is our endeavour fully to establish our claim to our
world-self. We know all our poverty and sufferings are owing to our
inability to realise this legitimate claim of ours. Really, there is no
limit to our powers, for we are not outside the universal power which is
the expression of universal law. We are on our way to overcome disease
and death, to conquer pain and poverty; for through scientific knowledge
we are ever on our way to realise the universal in its physical aspect.
And as we make progress we find that pain, disease, and poverty of power
are not absolute, but that is only the want of adjustment of our
individual self to our universal self which gives rise to them.

It is the same with our spiritual life. When the individual man in us
chafes against the lawful rule of the universal man we become morally
small, and we must suffer. In such a condition our successes are our
greatest failures, and the very fulfilment of our desires leaves us
poorer. We hanker after special gains for ourselves, we want to enjoy
privileges which none else can share with us. But everything that is
absolutely special must keep up a perpetual warfare with what is
general. In such a state of civil war man always lives behind
barricades, and in any civilisation which is selfish our homes are not
real homes, but artificial barriers around us. Yet we complain that we
are not happy, as if there were something inherent in the nature of
things to make us miserable. The universal spirit is waiting to crown us
with happiness, but our individual spirit would not accept it. It is our
life of the self that causes conflicts and complications everywhere,
upsets the normal balance of society and gives rise to miseries of all
kinds. It brings things to such a pass that to maintain order we have to
create artificial coercions and organised forms of tyranny, and tolerate
infernal institutions in our midst, whereby at every moment humanity is
humiliated.

We have seen that in order to be powerful we have to submit to the laws
of the universal forces, and to realise in practice that they are our
own. So, in order to be happy, we have to submit our individual will to
the sovereignty of the universal will, and to feel in truth that it is
our own will. When we reach that state wherein the adjustment of the
finite in us to the infinite is made perfect, then pain itself becomes a
valuable asset. It becomes a measuring rod with which to gauge the true
value of our joy.

The most important lesson that man can learn from his life is not that
there *is* pain in this world, but that it depends upon him to turn it
into good account, that it is possible for him to transmute it into joy.
The lesson has not been lost altogether to us, and there is no man
living who would willingly be deprived of his right to suffer pain, for
that is his right to be a man. One day the wife of a poor labourer
complained bitterly to me that her eldest boy was going to be sent away
to a rich relative's house for part of the year. It was the implied kind
intention of trying to relieve her of her trouble that gave her the
shock, for a mother's trouble is a mother's own by her inalienable right
of love, and she was not going to surrender it to any dictates of
expediency. Man's freedom is never in being saved troubles, but it is
the freedom to take trouble for his own good, to make the trouble an
element in his joy. It can be made so only when we realise that our
individual self is not the highest meaning of our being, that in us we
have the world-man who is immortal, who is not afraid of death or
sufferings, and who looks upon pain as only the other side of joy. He
who has realised this knows that it is pain which is our true wealth as
imperfect beings, and has made us great and worthy to take our seat with
the perfect. He knows that we are not beggars; that it is the hard coin
which must be paid for everything valuable in this life, for our power,
our wisdom, our love; that in pain is symbolised the infinite
possibility of perfection, the eternal unfolding of joy; and the man who
loses all pleasure in accepting pain sinks down and down to the lowest
depth of penury and degradation. It is only when we invoke the aid of
pain for our self-gratification that she becomes evil and takes her
vengeance for the insult done to her by hurling us into misery. For she
is the vestal virgin consecrated to the service of the immortal
perfection, and when she takes her true place before the altar of the
infinite she casts off her dark veil and bares her face to the beholder
as a revelation of supreme joy.
