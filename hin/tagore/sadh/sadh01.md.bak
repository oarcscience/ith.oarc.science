Author's Preface

Perhaps it is well for me to explain that the subject-matter of the
papers published in this book has not been philosophically treated, nor
has it been approached from the scholar's point of view. The writer has
been brought up in a family where texts of the Upanishads are used in
daily worship; and he has had before him the example of his father, who
lived his long life in the closest communion with God, while not
neglecting his duties to the world, or allowing his keen interest in all
human affairs to suffer any abatement. So in these papers, it may be
hoped, western readers will have an opportunity of coming into touch
with the ancient spirit of India as revealed in our sacred texts and
manifested in the life of to-day.

All the great utterances of man have to be judged not by the letter but
by the spirit--the spirit which unfolds itself with the growth of life
in history. We get to know the real meaning of Christianity by observing
its living aspect at the present moment--however different that may be,
even in important respects, from the Christianity of earlier periods.

For western scholars the great religious scriptures of India seem to
possess merely a retrospective and archælogical interest; but to us they
are of living importance, and we cannot help thinking that they lose
their significance when exhibited in labelled cases--mummied specimens
of human thought and aspiration, preserved for all time in the wrappings
of erudition.

The meaning of the living words that come out of the experiences of
great hearts can never be exhausted by any one system of logical
interpretation. They have to be endlessly explained by the commentaries
of individual lives, and they gain an added mystery in each new
revelation. To me the verses of the Upanishads and the teachings of
Buddha have ever been things of the spirit, and therefore endowed with
boundless vital growth; and I have used them, both in my own life and in
my preaching, as being instinct with individual meaning for me, as for
others, and awaiting for their confirmation, my own special testimony,
which must have its value because of its individuality.

I should add perhaps that these papers embody in a connected form,
suited to this publication, ideas which have been culled from several of
the Bengali discourses which I am in the habit of giving to my students
in my school at Bolpur in Bengal; and I have used here and there
translations of passages from these done by my friends, Babu Satish
Chandra Roy and Babu Ajit Kumar Chakravarti. The last paper of this
series, "Realisation in Action," has been translated from my Bengali
discourse on "Karma- yoga" by my nephew, Babu Surendra Nath Tagore.

I take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to Professor James H.
Woods, of Harvard University, for his generous appreciation which
encouraged me to complete this series of papers and read most of them
before the Harvard University. And I offer my thanks to Mr. Ernest Rhys
for his kindness in helping me with suggestions and revisions, and in
going through the proofs.

A word may be added about the pronouncing of Sādhanā: the accent falls
decisively on the first ā, which has the broad sound of the letter.
