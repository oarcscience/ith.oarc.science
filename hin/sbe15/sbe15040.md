Textual Heritage

### SEVENTH ANUVÂKA.

'In the beginning this was non-existent (not yet defined by form and
name). From it was born what exists. That made itself its Self,
therefore it is called the Self-made <span
id="fr_221"></span>[3](#fn_221.md).' That which is Self-made is a
flavour <span id="fr_222"></span>[4](#fn_222) (can be tasted.md), for only
after perceiving a flavour can any one perceive pleasure. Who could
breathe, who could breathe forth, if that bliss (Brahman)

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

existed not in the ether (in the heart)? For he alone causes
blessedness.

When he finds freedom from fear and rest in that which is invisible,
incorporeal, undefined, unsupported, then he has obtained the fearless.
For if he makes but the smallest distinction in it, there is fear for
him} <span id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_223.md). But that fear exists only
for one who thinks himself wise <span id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_224.md),
(not for the true sage.)

On this there is also this *S*loka:

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_219"></span>[58:1](sbe15039.htm#fr_219.md) In the
*Kh*ândogya-upanishad VI, 2, 1, where a similar account of the creation
is given, the subject is spoken of as tad, neuter. It is said there: 'In
the beginning there was that only which is, one only, without a second.
It willed, may I be many,' &c. (Cf. B*ri*h. Âr. Up. Vol. ii, p. 52.)

<span id="fn_220"></span>[58:2](sbe15039.htm#fr_220.md) What appears as
real and unreal to the senses, not the really real and unreal.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[58:3](sbe15040.htm#fr_221.md) Cf. Ait. Up. I, 2,
3.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[58:4](sbe15040.htm#fr_222.md) As flavour is the
cause of pleasure, so Brahman is the cause of all things. The wise taste
the flavour of existence, and know that it proceeds from Brahman, the
Self-made. See Kaushîtaki-upanishad I, 5; Sacred Books, vol. i, p. 277.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[59:1](sbe15040.htm#fr_223.md) Fear arises only
from what is not ourselves. Therefore, as soon as there is even the
smallest distinction made between our Self and the real Self, there is a
possibility of fear. The explanation ud = api, aram = alpam is very
doubtful, but recognised in the schools. It could hardly be a proverbial
expression, 'if he makes another stomach' meaning as much as, 'if he
admits another person.' According to the commentator, we should
translate, 'for one who knows (a difference), and does not know the
oneness.'

<span id="fn_224"></span>[59:2](sbe15040.htm#fr_224.md) I read manvânasya,
the commentator amanvânasya.
