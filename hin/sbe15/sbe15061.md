### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_340"></span>[2](#fn_340).

1\. Now when Yâ*gñ*avalkya was going to enter upon another state, he
said: 'Maitreyî <span id="fr_341"></span>[3](#fn_341), verily I am going
away from this my house (into the forest <span
id="fr_342"></span>[4](#fn_342)). Forsooth, let me make a settlement
between thee and that Kâtyâyanî (my other wife).'

2\. Maitreyî said: 'My Lord, if this whole earth, full of wealth,
belonged to me, tell me, should I be immortal by it <span
id="fr_343"></span>[5](#fn_343)?'

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

'No,' replied Yâ*gñ*avalkya; 'like the life of rich people will be thy
life. But there is no hope of immortality by wealth.'

3\. And Maitreyî said: 'What should I do with that by which I do not
become immortal? What my Lord knoweth (of immortality), tell that to
me <span id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_344).'

4\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'Thou who art truly dear to me, thou speakest
dear words <span id="fr_345"></span>[2](#fn_345). Come, sit down, I will
explain it to thee, and mark well what I say.'

5\. And he said: 'Verily, a husband is not dear, that you may love the
husband; but that you may love the Self, therefore a husband is dear.

'Verily, a wife is not dear, that you may love the wife; but that you
may love the Self, therefore a wife is dear.

'Verily, sons are not dear, that you may love the sons; but that you may
love the Self, therefore sons are dear.

'Verily, wealth is not dear, that you may love wealth; but that you may
love the Self, therefore wealth is dear <span
id="fr_346"></span>[3](#fn_346).

'Verily, the Brahman-class is not dear, that you may love the
Brahman-class; but that you may love the Self, therefore the
Brahman-class is dear.

'Verily, the Kshatra-class is not dear, that you may love the
Kshatra-class; but that you may love the Self, therefore the
Kshatra-class is dear.

'Verily, the worlds are not dear, that you may love the worlds; but that
you may love the Self, therefore the worlds are dear.

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

'Verily, the Devas are not dear, that you may love the Devas; but that
you may love the Self, therefore the Devas are dear <span
id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_347).

'Verily, creatures are not dear, that you may love the creatures; but
that you may love the Self, therefore are creatures dear.

'Verily, everything is not dear that you may love everything; but that
you may love the Self, therefore everything is dear.

'Verily, the Self is to be seen, to be heard, to be perceived, to be
marked, O Maitreyî! When we see, hear, perceive, and know the Self <span
id="fr_348"></span>[2](#fn_348), then all this is known.

6\. 'Whosoever looks for the Brahman-class elsewhere than in the Self,
was <span id="fr_349"></span>[3](#fn_349) abandoned by the
Brahman-class. Whosoever looks for the Kshatra-class elsewhere than in
the Self, was abandoned by the Kshatra-class. Whosoever looks for the
worlds elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the worlds.
Whosoever looks for the Devas elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned
by the Devas <span id="fr_350"></span>[4](#fn_350). Whosoever looks for
creatures elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the creatures.
Whosoever looks for anything elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned
by everything. This Brahman-class, this Kshatra-class, these worlds,
these Devas <span id="fr_351"></span>[5](#fn_351), these <span
id="fr_352"></span>[6](#fn_352) creatures, this everything, all is that
Self.

7\. 'Now as <span id="fr_353"></span>[7](#fn_353) the sounds of a drum,
when beaten,

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

cannot be seized externally (by themselves), but the sound is seized,
when the drum is seized or the beater of the drum;

8., And as the sounds of a conch-shell, when blown, cannot be seized
externally (by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the shell is
seized or the blower of the shell;

9\. 'And as the sounds of a lute, when played, cannot be seized
externally (by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the lute is
seized or the player of the lute;

10\. 'As clouds of smoke proceed by themselves out of a lighted fire
kindled with damp fuel, thus, verily, O Maitreyî, has been breathed
forth from this great Being what we have as *Ri*g-veda, Ya*g*ur-veda,
Sama-veda, Atharvâṅgirasas, Itihâsa (legends), Purâ*n*a (cosmogonies),
Vidyâ (knowledge), the Upanishads, *S*lokas (verses), Sûtras (prose
rules), Anuvyâkhyânas (glosses), Vyâkhyânas (commentaries) <span
id="fr_354"></span>[1](#fn_354). From him alone all these were breathed
forth.

11\. 'As all waters find their centre in the sea, all touches in the
skin, all tastes in the tongue, all smells in the nose, all colours in
the eye, all sounds in the ear, all percepts in the mind, all knowledge
in the heart, all actions in the hands, all movements in the feet, and
all the Vedas in speech,--

12\. 'As a lump of salt <span id="fr_355"></span>[2](#fn_355), when
thrown into water, becomes dissolved into water, and could not be taken

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

out again, but wherever we taste (the water) it is salt,--thus verily, O
Maitreyî, does this great Being, endless, unlimited, consisting of
nothing but knowledge <span id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_356), rise from
out these elements, and vanish again in them. When he has departed,
there is no more knowledge (name), I say, O Maitreyî.' Thus spoke
Yâ*gñ*avalkya.

13\. Then Maitreyî said: 'Here thou hast bewildered me, Sir, when thou
sayest that having departed, there is no more knowledge <span
id="fr_357"></span>[2](#fn_357).'

But Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'O Maitreyî, I say nothing that is
bewildering. This is enough, O beloved, for wisdom <span
id="fr_358"></span>[3](#fn_358).

'For when there is as it were duality, then one sees the other, one
smells the other, one hears the other <span
id="fr_359"></span>[4](#fn_359), one salutes the other <span
id="fr_360"></span>[5](#fn_360), one perceives the other <span
id="fr_361"></span>[6](#fn_361), one knows the other; but when the Self
only is all this, how should he smell another <span
id="fr_362"></span>[7](#fn_362), how should he see <span
id="fr_363"></span>[8](#fn_363) another <span
id="fr_364"></span>[9](#fn_364), how should he hear <span
id="fr_365"></span>[10](#fn_365) another, how should he salute <span
id="fr_366"></span>[11](#fn_366) another, how should he perceive
another <span id="fr_367"></span>[12](#fn_367), how should he know
another? How should he know Him by whom he knows all this?

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> How, O beloved,
should he know (himself), the Knower <span
id="fr_368"></span>[1](sbe15062.htm#fn_368)?'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_340"></span>[108:2](sbe15061.htm#fr_340) Mâdhyandina text,
p. 1062. To the end of the third Brâhma*n*a of the second Adhyâya, all
that has been taught does not yet impart the highest knowledge, the
identity of the personal and the true Self, the Brahman. In the fourth
Brâhma*n*a, in which the knowledge of the true Brahman is to be set
forth, the Sa*m*nyâsa, the retiring from the world, is enjoined, when
all desires cease, and no duties are to be performed (Sa*m*nyâsa,
pârivâ*g*ya). The story is told again with slight variations in the
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka-upanishad IV, 5. The more important variations,
occurring in IV, 5, are added here, marked with B. There are besides the
various readings of the Mâdhyandina*s*âkhâ of the
*S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a. See also Deussen, Vedânta, p. 185.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[108:3](sbe15061.htm#fr_341) In B*ri*h. Up. IV,
5, the story begins: Yâ*gñ*avalkya had two wives, Maitreyî and
Kâtyâyanî. Of these Maitreyî was conversant with Brahman, but Kâtyâyanî
possessed such knowledge only as women possess.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[108:4](sbe15061.htm#fr_342) Instead of
udyâsyan, B. gives pravra*g*ishyan, the more technical term.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[108:5](sbe15061.htm#fr_343) Should I be
immortal by it, or no? B.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[109:1](sbe15061.htm#fr_344) Tell that clearly
to me. B.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[109:2](sbe15061.htm#fr_345) Thou who art dear
to me, thou hast increased what is dear (to me in this). B.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[109:3](sbe15061.htm#fr_346) B. adds, Verily,
cattle are not dear, &c.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[110:1](sbe15061.htm#fr_347) B. inserts,
Verily, the Vedas are not dear, &c.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[110:2](sbe15061.htm#fr_348) When the Self has
been seen, heard, perceived, and known. B.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[110:3](sbe15061.htm#fr_349) The commentator
translates, 'should be abandoned.'

<span id="fn_350"></span>[110:4](sbe15061.htm#fr_350) B. inserts,
Whosoever looks for the Vedas, &c.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[110:5](sbe15061.htm#fr_351) B. adds, these
Vedas.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[110:6](sbe15061.htm#fr_352) B. has, all these
creatures.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[110:7](sbe15061.htm#fr_353) I construe sa
yathâ with evam vai in § 12, looking upon <span id="page_111">p.
111</span> § 11 as probably a later insertion. The sa is not the
pronoun, but a particle, as in sa yadi, sa *k*et, &c.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[111:1](sbe15061.htm#fr_354) B. adds, what is
sacrificed, what is poured out, food, drink, this world and the other
world, and all creatures.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[111:2](sbe15061.htm#fr_355) See *Kh*ând. Up.
VI, 13.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[112:1](sbe15061.htm#fr_356) As a mass of salt
has neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass of taste, thus
indeed has that Self neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a
mass of knowledge. B.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[112:2](sbe15061.htm#fr_357) 'Here, Sir, thou
hast landed me in utter bewilderment. Indeed, I do not understand him.'
B.

<span id="fn_358"></span>[112:3](sbe15061.htm#fr_358) Verily, beloved,
that Self is imperishable, and of an indestructible nature. B.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[112:4](sbe15061.htm#fr_359) B. inserts, one
tastes the other.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[112:5](sbe15061.htm#fr_360) B. inserts, one
hears the other.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[112:6](sbe15061.htm#fr_361) B. inserts, one
touches the other.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[112:7](sbe15061.htm#fr_362) See, B.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[112:8](sbe15061.htm#fr_363) Smell, B.

<span id="fn_364"></span>[112:9](sbe15061.htm#fr_364) B. inserts taste.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[112:10](sbe15061.htm#fr_365) Salute, B.

<span id="fn_366"></span>[112:11](sbe15061.htm#fr_366) Hear, B.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[112:12](sbe15061.htm#fr_367) B. inserts, how
should he touch another?
