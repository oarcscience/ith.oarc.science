### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. Manifest, near, moving in the cave (of the heart) is the great
Being. In it everything is centred which ye know as moving, breathing,
and blinking, as being and not-being, as adorable, as the best, that is
beyond the understanding of creatures.

2\. That which is brilliant, smaller than small, that on which the
worlds are founded and their inhabitants, that is the indestructible
Brahman, that is the breath, speech, mind; that is the true, that is the
immortal. That is to be hit. Hit it, O friend!

3\. Having taken the Upanishad as the bow, as the great weapon, let him
place on it the arrow, sharpened by devotion! Then having drawn it with
a thought directed to that which is, hit the mark, O friend, viz. that
which is the Indestructible!

4\. Om is the bow, the Self is the arrow, Brahman is called its aim. It
is to be hit by a man who is not thoughtless; and then, as the arrow
(becomes one with the target), he will become one with Brahman.

5\. In him the heaven, the earth, and the sky are woven, the mind also
with all the senses. Know him alone as the Self, and leave off other
words! He is the bridge of the Immortal.

6\. He moves about becoming manifold within the heart where the arteries
meet, like spokes fastened to the nave. Meditate on the Self as Om! Hail
to you, that you may cross beyond (the sea of) darkness!

7\. He who understands all and who knows all, he to whom all this glory
in the world belongs, the

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

Self, is placed in the ether, in the heavenly city of Brahman (the
heart). He assumes the nature of mind, and becomes the guide of the body
of the senses. He subsists in food, in close proximity to the heart. The
wise who understand this, behold the Immortal which shines forth full of
bliss.

8\. The fetter of the heart is broken, all doubts are solved, all his
works (and their effects) perish when He has been beheld who is high and
low (cause and effect) <span id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_177).

9\. In the highest golden sheath there is the Brahman without passions
and without parts. That is pure, that is the light of lights, that is it
which they know who know the Self.

10\. The <span id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_178) sun does not thine there,
nor the moon and the stars, nor these lightnings, and much less this
fire. When he shines, everything shines after him; by his light all this
is lighted <span id="fr_179"></span>[3](#fn_179).

11\. That immortal Brahman is before, that Brahman is behind, that
Brahman is right and left. It has gone forth below and above; Brahman
alone is all this, it is the best.
