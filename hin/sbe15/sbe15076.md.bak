### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

1\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya continued: 'Now when that Self, having sunk into
weakness <span id="fr_507"></span>[3](#fn_507.md), sinks, as it were, into

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

unconsciousness, then gather those senses (prâ*n*as) around him, and he,
taking with him those elements of light, descends into the heart When
that person in the eye <span id="fr_508"></span>[1](#fn_508.md) turns away,
then he ceases to know any forms.

2\. '"He has become one," they say, "he does not see <span
id="fr_509"></span>[2](#fn_509.md)." "He has become one," they say, "he
does not smell." "He has become one," they say, "he does not taste." "He
has become one," they say, "he does not speak." "He has become one,"
they say, "he does not hear." "He has become one," they say, "he does
not think." "He has become one," they say, "he does not touch." "He has
become one," they say, "he does not know." The point of his heart <span
id="fr_510"></span>[3](#fn_510.md) becomes lighted up, and by that light
the Self departs, either through the eye <span
id="fr_511"></span>[4](#fn_511.md), or through the skull <span
id="fr_512"></span>[5](#fn_512.md), or through other places of the body.
And when he thus departs, life (the chief prâ*n*a) departs after him,
and when life thus departs, all the other

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

vital spirits (prâ*n*as) depart after it. He is conscious, and being
conscious he follows <span id="fr_513"></span>[1](#fn_513.md) and departs.

'Then both his knowledge and his work take hold of him, and his
acquaintance with former things <span id="fr_514"></span>[2](#fn_514.md).'

3\. 'And as a caterpillar, after having reached the end of a blade of
grass, and after having made another approach (to another blade) <span
id="fr_515"></span>[3](#fn_515.md), draws itself together towards it, thus
does this Self, after having thrown off this body <span
id="fr_516"></span>[4](#fn_516.md) and dispelled all ignorance, and after
making another approach (to another body), draw himself together towards
it.

4\. And as a goldsmith, taking a piece of gold, turns it into another,
newer and more beautiful shape, so does this Self, after having thrown
off this body

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

and dispelled all ignorance, make unto himself another, newer and more
beautiful shape, whether it be like the Fathers, or like the Gandharvas,
or like the Devas, or like Pra*g*âpati, or like Brahman, or like other
beings.

5\. 'That Self is indeed Brahman, consisting of knowledge, mind, life,
sight, hearing, earth, water, wind, ether, light and no light, desire
and no desire, anger and no anger, right or wrong, and all things. Now
as a man is like this or like that <span
id="fr_517"></span>[1](#fn_517.md), according as he acts and according as
he behaves, so will he be:--a man of good acts will become good, a man
of bad acts, bad. He becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds.

'And here they say that a person consists of desires. And as is his
desire, so is his will; and as is his will, so is his deed; and whatever
deed he does, that he will reap.

6\. 'And here there is this verse: "To whatever object a man's own mind
is attached, to that he goes strenuously together with his deed; and
having obtained the end (the last results) of whatever deed he does here
on earth, he returns again from that world (which is the temporary
reward of his deed) to this world of action."

'So much for the man who desires. But as to the man who does not desire,
who, not desiring, freed from desires, is satisfied in his desires, or
desires the Self only, his vital spirits do not depart elsewhere,--being
Brahman, he goes to Brahman.

7\. 'On this there is this verse: "When all desires

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

which once entered his heart are undone, then does the mortal become
immortal, then he obtains Brahman.

'And as the slough of a snake lies on an ant-hill, dead and cast away,
thus lies this body; but that disembodied immortal spirit (prâ*n*a,
life) is Brahman only, is only light.'

*G*anaka Vaideha said: 'Sir, I give you a thousand.'

8 <span id="fr_518"></span>[1](#fn_518.md). 'On this there are these
verses:

'The small, old path stretching far away <span
id="fr_519"></span>[2](#fn_519.md) has been found by me. On it sages who
know Brahman move on to the Svarga-loka (heaven), and thence higher on,
as entirely free <span id="fr_520"></span>[3](#fn_520.md).

9\. 'On that path they say that there is white, or blue, or yellow, or
green, or red <span id="fr_521"></span>[4](#fn_521.md); that path was found
by Brahman, and on it goes whoever knows Brahman, and who has done good,
and obtained splendour.

10\. 'All who worship what is not knowledge (avidyâ) enter into blind
darkness: those who delight in knowledge, enter, as it were, into
greater darkness <span id="fr_522"></span>[5](#fn_522.md).

11\. 'There are <span id="fr_523"></span>[6](#fn_523.md) indeed those
unblessed worlds,

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

covered with blind darkness. Men who are ignorant and not enlightened go
after death to those worlds.

12\. 'If a man understands the Self, saying, "I am He," what could he
wish or desire that he should pine after the body <span
id="fr_524"></span>[1](#fn_524.md).

13\. 'Whoever has found and understood the Self that has entered into
this patched-together hiding-place <span
id="fr_525"></span>[2](#fn_525.md), he indeed is the creator, for he is the
maker of everything, his is the world, and he is the world itself <span
id="fr_526"></span>[3](#fn_526.md).

14\. 'While we are here, we may know this; if not, I am ignorant <span
id="fr_527"></span>[4](#fn_527.md), and there is great destruction. Those
who know it, become immortal, but others suffer pain indeed.

15\. 'If a man clearly beholds this Self as God, and as the lord of all
that is and will be, then he is no more afraid.

16\. 'He behind whom the year revolves with the days, him the gods
worship as the light of lights, as immortal time.

17\. 'He in whom the five beings <span id="fr_528"></span>[5](#fn_528.md)
and the ether rest, him alone I believe to be the Self,--I who

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

know, believe him to be Brahman; I who am immortal, believe him to be
immortal.

18\. 'They who know the life of life, the eye of the eye, the ear of the
ear, the mind of the mind, they have comprehended the ancient, primeval
Brahman <span id="fr_529"></span>[1](#fn_529.md).

19\. 'By the mind alone it is to be perceived <span
id="fr_530"></span>[2](#fn_530.md), there is in it no diversity. He who
perceives therein any diversity, goes from death to death.

20\. 'This eternal being that can never be proved, is to be perceived in
one way only; it is spotless, beyond the ether, the unborn Self, great
and eternal.

21\. 'Let a wise Brâhma*n*a, after he has discovered him, practise
wisdom <span id="fr_531"></span>[3](#fn_531.md). Let him not seek after
many words, for that is mere weariness of the tongue.

22\. 'And he is that great unborn Self, who consists of knowledge, is
surrounded by the Prâ*n*as, the ether within the heart <span
id="fr_532"></span>[4](#fn_532.md). In it there reposes the ruler of all,
the lord of all, the king of all. He does not become greater by good
works, nor smaller by evil works. He is the lord of all, the king of all
things, the protector of all things. He is a bank <span
id="fr_533"></span>[5](#fn_533.md) and a boundary, so that these worlds may
not be confounded. Brâhma*n*as seek to know him by the study of the
Veda, by sacrifice, by gifts, by penance, by fasting, and he who knows
him, becomes a Muni. Wishing for that world (for Brahman) only,
mendicants leave their homes.

'Knowing this, the people of old did not wish for offspring. What shall
we do with offspring, they said,

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

we who have this Self and this world (of Brahman) <span
id="fr_534"></span>[1](#fn_534.md)? And they, having risen above the desire
for sons, wealth, and new worlds, wander about as mendicants. For desire
for sons is desire for wealth, and desire for wealth is desire for
worlds. Both these are indeed desires only. He, the Self, is to be
described by No, no <span id="fr_535"></span>[2](#fn_535.md)! He is
incomprehensible, for he cannot be comprehended; he is imperishable, for
he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not attach himself;
unfettered, he does not suffer, he does not fail. Him (who knows), these
two do not overcome, whether he says that for some reason he has done
evil, or for some reason he has done good--he overcomes both, and
neither what he has done, nor what he has omitted to do, burns (affects)
him.

23\. 'This has been told by a verse (*Rik*): "This eternal greatness of
the Brâhma*n*a does not grow larger by work, nor does it grow smaller.
Let man try to find (know) its trace, for having found (known) it, he is
not sullied by any evil deed."

'He therefore that knows it, after having become quiet, subdued,
satisfied, patient, and collected <span id="fr_536"></span>[3](#fn_536.md),
sees self in Self, sees all as Self. Evil does not overcome him, he
overcomes all evil. Evil does not burn him, he burns all evil. Free from
evil, free from spots, free from doubt, he becomes a (true) Brâhma*n*a;
this is the Brahma-world, O King,'--thus spoke Yâ*gñ*avalkya.

*G*anaka Vaideha said: 'Sir, I give you the Videhas, and also myself, to
be together your slaves.'

24\. This <span id="fr_537"></span>[4](#fn_537.md) indeed is the great, the
unborn Self, the

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

strong <span id="fr_538"></span>[1](#fn_538.md), the giver of wealth. He
who knows this obtains wealth.

25\. This great, unborn Self, undecaying, undying, immortal, fearless,
is indeed Brahman. Fearless is Brahman, and he who knows this becomes
verily the fearless Brahman.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_505"></span>[173:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_505.md) See § 17, before.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[173:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_506.md) *S*aṅkara seems to
take ukkhvâsî as a noun. He writes: yatraitad bhavati; etad iti
kriyâvi*s*esha*n*am ûrdhvô*khh*vâsî yatrordhvo*kkh*vâsitvam asya
bhavatîtyartha*h*.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[173:3](sbe15076.htm#fr_507.md) In the Kaush. Up.
III, 3, we read yatraitat purusha ârto <span id="page_174">p. 174</span>
marishyan âbâlyam etya sammohati. Here âbâlyam should certainly be
âbălyam, as in the commentary; but should it not be ăbălyam, as here.
See also B*ri*h. Up. III, 5, 1, note.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[174:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_508.md) *K*âkshusha
purusha is explained as that portion of the sun which is in the eye,
while it is active, but which, at the time of death, returns to the sun.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[174:2](sbe15076.htm#fr_509.md) Ekîbhavati is
probably a familiar expression for dying, but it is here explained by
*S*aṅkara, and probably was so intended, as meaning that the organs of
the body have become one with the Self (liṅgâtman). The same thoughts
are found in the Kaush. Up. III, 3, prâ*n*a ekadhâ bhavati.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[174:3](sbe15076.htm#fr_510.md) The point where
the nâ*d*îs or veins go out from the heart.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[174:4](sbe15076.htm#fr_511.md) When his knowledge
and deeds qualify him to proceed to the sun. *S*aṅkara.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[174:5](sbe15076.htm#fr_512.md) When his knowledge
and deeds qualify him to proceed to the Brahma-world.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[175:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_513.md) This is an obscure
passage, and the different text of the Mâdhyandinas shows that the
obscurity was felt at an early time. The Mâdhyandinas read: Sa*mgñ*ânam
anvavakrâmati sa esha *gñ*a*h* savi*gñ*âno bhavati. This would mean,
'Consciousness departs after. He the knowing (Self) is self-conscious.'
The Kâ*n*vas read: Savi*gñ*âno bhavati, savi*gñ*ânam evânvavakrâmati.
Roer translates: 'It is endowed with knowledge, endowed with knowledge
it departs;' and he explains, with *S*aṅkara, that the knowledge here
intended is such knowledge as one has in a dream, a knowledge of
impressions referring to their respective objects, a knowledge which is
the effect of actions, and not inherent in the self. Deussen translates:
'Sie (die Seele) ist von Erkenntnissart, und was von Erkenntnissart ist,
ziehet ihr nach.' The Persian translator evidently thought that
self-consciousness was implied, for he writes: 'Cum quovis corpore
addictionem sumat . . . . in illo corpore aham est, id est, ego sum.'

<span id="fn_514"></span>[175:2](sbe15076.htm#fr_514.md) This acquaintance
with former things is necessary to explain the peculiar talents or
deficiencies which we observe in children. The three words vidyâ,
karman, and pûrvapra*gñ*â often go together (see *S*aṅkara on B*ri*h.
Up. IV, 3, 9). Deussen's conjecture, apûrvapra*gñ*â, is not called for.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[175:3](sbe15076.htm#fr_515.md) See B*ri*h. Up.
IV, 3, 9, a passage which shows how difficult it would be always to
translate the same Sanskrit words by the same words in English; see also
Brahmopanishad, p. 245.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[175:4](sbe15076.htm#fr_516.md) See B*ri*h. Up.
IV, 3, 9, and IV, 3, 13

<span id="fn_517"></span>[176:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_517.md) The iti after
adomaya is not clear to me, but it is quite clear that a new sentence
begins with tadyadetat, which Regnaud, II, p. 101 and p. 139, has not
observed.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[177:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_518.md) This may be
independent matter, or may be placed again into the mouth of
Yâgñavalkya.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[177:2](sbe15076.htm#fr_519.md) Instead of
vitata*h*, which perhaps seemed to be in contradiction with anu there is
a Mâdhyandina reading vitara, probably intended originally to mean
leading across. The other adjective mâm̐sp*ri*sh*t*a I cannot explain.
*S*aṅkara explains it by mâ*m* sp*ri*sh*t*a*h*, mayâ labdha*h*.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[177:3](sbe15076.htm#fr_520.md) That this is the
true meaning, is indicated by the various readings of the Mâdhyandinas,
tena dhîrâ apiyanti brahmavida utkramya svarga*m* lokam ito vimuktâ*h*.
The road is not to lead to Svarga only, but beyond.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[177:4](sbe15076.htm#fr_521.md) See the colours of
the veins as given before, IV, 3, 20.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[177:5](sbe15076.htm#fr_522.md) See Vâ*g*. Up. 9.
*S*aṅkara in our place explains avidyâ by works, and vidyâ by the Veda,
excepting the Upanishads.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[177:6](sbe15076.htm#fr_523.md) See Vâ*g*. Up. 3;
Ka*th*a Up. I. 3.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[178:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_524.md) That he should be
willing to suffer once more the pains inherent in the body. The
Mâdhyandinas read *s*arîram anu sa*m*karet, instead of sa*ñg*varet.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[178:2](sbe15076.htm#fr_525.md) The body is meant,
and is called deha from the root dih, to knead together. Roer gives
sa*m*dehye gahane, which *S*aṅkara explains by sa*m*dehe. Poley has
sa*m*deghe, which is the right Kâ*n*va reading. The Mâdhyandinas read
sa*m*dehe. Gahane might be taken as an adjective also, referring to
sa*m*dehe.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[178:3](sbe15076.htm#fr_526.md) *S*aṅkara takes
loka, world, for âtmâ, self.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[178:4](sbe15076.htm#fr_527.md) I have followed
*S*aṅkara in translating avedi*h* by ignorant, but the text seems
corrupt.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[178:5](sbe15076.htm#fr_528.md) The five *g*anas,
i.e. the Gandharvas, Pit*ri*s, Devas, Asuras, and Rakshas; or the four
castes with the Nishâdas; or breath, eye, ear, food, and mind.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[181:1](sbe15076.htm#fr_538.md) Annâda is here
explained as 'dwelling in all beings, and eating all food which they
eat.'
