<p>1. Then Kahola Kaush&icirc;takeya asked. 'Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, 'he said, 'tell me the Brahman which is visible, not invisible, the Self (&Acirc;tman), who is within all.'</p>  
<p>Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya replied: 'This, thy Self, who is within all.'</p>  
<p>'Which Self, O Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, is within all?'</p>  
<p>Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya replied: 'He who overcomes hunger and thirst, sorrow, passion, old age, and death. When Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as know that Self, and have risen above the desire for sons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, wealth, and (new) worlds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_405"></A><A HREF="#fn_405"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, they wander about as mendicants. For a desire for sons is desire for wealth, a desire for wealth is desire for worlds. Both these are indeed desires. Therefore let a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, after he has done with learning,</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_407"></A><A HREF="sbe15068.htm#fr_407">130:2</A> Mr. Gough proposes as an alternative rendering: 'Let a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a renounce learning and become as a child; and after renouncing learning and a childlike mind, let him become a quietist; and when he has made an end of quietism and non-quietism, he shall become a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a indeed.' Deussen takes a similar view, but I doubt whether 'the knowledge of babes' is not a Christian rather than an Indian idea, in spite of <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara's remarks on Ved. S&ucirc;tra, III, 4, 50, which are strangely at variance with his commentary here. Possibly the text may be corrupt, for tish<I>th</I>&acirc;set too is a very peculiar form. We might conjecture balyena, as we have abalyam, in IV, 4, 1. In Kaush. Up. III, 3, &acirc;b&acirc;lyam stands for &acirc;b&#0259;lyam, possibly for &#0259;b&#0259;lyam. The construction of kena sy&acirc;d yena sy&acirc;t tened<I>ri</I><I>s</I>a eva, however, is well known.</P>
