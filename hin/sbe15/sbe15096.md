### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_610"></span>[2](#fn_610.md).

1\. If a man wishes to reach greatness (wealth for performing
sacrifices), he performs the upasad rule during twelve days <span
id="fr_611"></span>[3](#fn_611.md) (i. e. he lives on small quantities of
milk), beginning on an auspicious day of the light half of the moon
during the northern progress of the sun, collecting at the same time in
a cup or a dish

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

made of Udumbara wood all sorts of herbs, including fruits. He sweeps
the floor (near the house-altar, âvasathya), sprinkles it, lays the
fire, spreads grass round it according to rule <span
id="fr_612"></span>[1](#fn_612), prepares the clarified butter (â*g*ya.md),
and on a day, presided over by a male star (nakshatra), after having
properly mixed the Mantha <span id="fr_613"></span>[2](#fn_613.md) (the
herbs, fruits, milk, honey, &c.), he sacrifices (he pours â*g*ya into
the fire), saying <span id="fr_614"></span>[3](#fn_614.md): 'O *G*âtavedas,
whatever adverse gods there are in thee, who defeat the desires of men,
to them I offer this portion; may they, being pleased, please me with
all desires.' Svâhâ!

'That cross deity who lies down <span id="fr_615"></span>[4](#fn_615.md),
thinking that all things are kept asunder by her, I worship thee as
propitious with this stream of ghee.' Svâhâ!

2\. He then says, Svâhâ to the First, Svâhâ to the Best, pours ghee into
the fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Svâhâ to Breath, Svâhâ to her who is the richest, pours
ghee into the fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Svâhâ to Speech, Svâhâ to the Support, pours ghee into the
fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Svâhâ to the Eye, Svâhâ to Success, pours ghee into the
fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Svâhâ to the Ear, Svâhâ to the

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Home, pours ghee
into the fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Svâhâ to the Mind, Svâhâ to Offspring, pours ghee into the
fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Svâhâ to Seed, pours ghee into the fire, and throws what
remains into the Mantha (mortar).

3\. He then says, Svâhâ to Agni (fire), pours ghee into the fire, and
throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Svâhâ to Soma, pours ghee into the fire, and throws what
remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Bhû*h* (earth), Svâhâ, pours ghee into the fire, and
throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Bhuva*h* (sky), Svâhâ, pours ghee into the fire, and
throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Sva*h* (heaven), Svâhâ, pours ghee into the fire, and
throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Bhûr, Bhuva*h*, Sva*h*, Svâhâ, pours ghee into the fire,
and throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Svâhâ to Brahman (the priesthood), pours ghee into the
fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Svâhâ to Kshatra (the knighthood), pours ghee into the
fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Svâhâ to the Past, pours ghee into the fire, and throws
what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

He then says, Svâhâ to the Future, pours ghee into the fire, and throws
what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Svâhâ to the Universe, pours ghee into the fire, and
throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Svâhâ to all things, pours ghee into the fire, and throws
what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

He then says, Svâhâ to Pra*g*âpati, pours ghee into the fire, and throws
what remains into the Mantha (mortar).

4\. Then he touches it (the Mantha, which is dedicated to Prâ*n*a,
breath), saying: 'Thou art fleet (as breath). Thou art burning (as
fire). Thou art full (as Brahman). Thou art firm (as the sky). Thou art
the abode of all (as the earth). Thou hast been saluted with Hiṅ (at the
beginning of the sacrifice by the prastot*ri*). Thou art saluted with
Hiṅ (in the middle of the sacrifice by the prastot*ri*). Thou hast been
sung (by the udgât*ri* at the beginning of the sacrifice). Thou art sung
(by the udgât*ri* in the middle of the sacrifice). Thou hast been
celebrated (by the adhvaryu at the beginning of the sacrifice). Thou art
celebrated again (by the âgnîdhra in the middle of the sacrifice). Thou
art bright in the wet (cloud). Thou art great. Thou art powerful. Thou
art food (as Soma). Thou art light (as Agni, fire, the eater). Thou art
the end. Thou art the absorption (of all things).'

5\. Then he holds it (the Mantha) forth, saying

'Thou <span id="fr_616"></span>[1](#fn_616.md) knowest all, we know thy
greatness. He is

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

indeed a king, a ruler, the highest lord. May that king, that ruler make
me the highest lord.'

6\. Then he eats it, saying: 'Tat savitur vare*n*yam <span
id="fr_617"></span>[1](#fn_617.md) (We meditate on that adorable
light)--The winds drop honey for the righteous, the rivers drop honey,
may our plants be sweet as honey! Bhû*h* (earth) Svâhâ!

'Bhargo devasya dhîmahi (of the divine Savit*ri*)--May the night be
honey in the morning, may the air above the earth, may heaven, our
father, be honey! Bhuva*h* (sky) Svâhâ!'

'Dhiyo yo nah pro*k*odayât (who should rouse our thoughts)--May the tree
be full of honey, may the sun be full of honey, may our cows be sweet
like honey! Sva*h* (heaven) Svâhâ!'

He repeats the whole Sâvitrî verse, and all the verses about the honey,
thinking, May I be all this! Bhûr, Bhuva*h*, Sva*h*, Svâhâ! Having thus
swallowed all, he washes his hands, and sits down behind the altar,
turning his head to the East. In the morning he worships Âditya (the
sun), with the hymn, 'Thou art the best lotus of the four quarters, may
I become the best lotus among men.' Then returning as he came, he sits
down behind the altar and recites the genealogical list <span
id="fr_618"></span>[2](#fn_618.md).

7\. Uddâlaka Âruni told this (Mantha-doctrine) to his pupil Vâ*g*asaneya
Yâ*gñ*avalkya, and said: 'If a man were to pour it on a dry stick,
branches would grow, and leaves spring forth.'

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

8\. Vâ*g*asaneya Yâ*gñ*avalkya told the same to his pupil Madhuka
Paiṅgya, and said: 'If a man were to pour it on a dry stick, branches
would grow, and leaves spring forth.'

9\. Madhuka Paiṅgya told the same to his pupil *K*ûla Bhâgavitti, and
said: 'If a man were to pour it on a dry stick, branches would grow, and
leaves spring forth.'

10\. *K*ûla Bhâgavitti told the same to his pupil *G*ânaki Âyasthû*n*a,
and said: 'If a man were to pour it on a dry stick, branches would grow,
and leaves spring forth.'

11\. *G*ânaki Âyasthû*n*a told the same to his pupil Satyakâma *G*âbâla,
and said: 'If a man were to pour it on a dry stick, branches would grow,
and leaves spring forth.'

12\. Satyakâma *G*âbâla told the same to his pupils, and said: 'If a man
were to pour it on a dry stick, branches would grow, and leaves spring
forth.'

Let no one tell this <span id="fr_619"></span>[1](#fn_619.md) to any one,
except to a son or to a pupil <span id="fr_620"></span>[2](#fn_620.md).

13\. Four things are made of the wood of the Udumbara tree, the
sacrificial ladle (sruva), the cup (*k*amasa), the fuel, and the two
churning sticks.

There are ten kinds of village (cultivated) seeds, viz. rice and barley
(brîhiyavâs), sesamum and kidney-beans (tilamâshâs), millet and panic
seed (a*n*upriyaṅgavas), wheat (godhûmâs), lentils (masûrâs), pulse
(khalvâs), and vetches (khalakulâs <span
id="fr_621"></span>[3](#fn_621).md) . After having

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

ground these he sprinkles them with curds (dadhi), honey, and ghee, and
then offers (the proper portions) of clarified butter <span
id="fr_622"></span>[1](sbe15097.htm#fn_622) (â*g*ya.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_610"></span>[209:2](sbe15096.htm#fr_610.md) Mâdhyandina text,
p. 1103; cf. *Kh*ând. Up. V, 2, 4-8; Kaush. Up. II, 3.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[209:3](sbe15096.htm#fr_611.md) Yasmin pu*n*ye
'nukûle 'hni karma *k*ikîrshati tata*h* prâk pu*n*yâham evârabhya
dvâda*s*âham upasadvratî.

<span id="fn_612"></span>[210:1](sbe15096.htm#fr_612.md) As the whole act
is considered smârta, not *s*rauta, the order to be observed (âv*ri*t)
is that of the sthâlîpâka.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[210:2](sbe15096.htm#fr_613.md) Dravadravye
prakshiptâ mathitâ*h* saktava*h* is the explanation of Mantha, given in
*G*aimin. N. M. V. p. 406.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[210:3](sbe15096.htm#fr_614.md) These verses are
not explained by *S*aṅkara, and they are absent in the *Kh*ând. Up. V,
2, 6, 4.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[210:4](sbe15096.htm#fr_615.md) The Mâdhyandinas
read nipadyase.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[212:1](sbe15096.htm#fr_616.md) These curious
words â ma*m*si â ma*m*hi te mahi are not explained by *S*aṅkara.
Ânandagiri explains them as I have translated <span id="page_213">p.
213</span> them. They correspond to 'amo, nâmâsy ama hi te sarvam idam'
in the *Kh*ând. Up. V, 2, 6, 6. The Mâdhyandinas read: 'âmo 'sy âma*m*
hi te mayi, sa hi râ*g*â, &c. Dvivedagaṅga translates: thou art the
knower, thy knowledge extends to me.'

<span id="fn_617"></span>[213:1](sbe15096.htm#fr_617.md) Rv. III, 62, 10.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[213:2](sbe15096.htm#fr_618.md) This probably
refers to the list immediately following.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[214:1](sbe15096.htm#fr_619.md) The
Mantha-doctrine with the prâ*n*adar*s*ana. Comm.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[214:2](sbe15096.htm#fr_620.md) It probably means
to no one except to one's own son and to one's own disciple. Cf. *S*vet.
Up. VI, 22.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[214:3](sbe15096.htm#fr_621.md) I have given the
English names after Roer, who, living in India, had the best opportunity
of identifying the various kinds of plants here mentioned. The
commentators do not help us much. *S*aṅkara <span id="page_215">p.
215</span> says that in some places Priyaṅgu (panic seed or millet) is
called Kaṅgu; that Khalva, pulse, is also called Nishpâva and Valla, and
Khalakula, vetches, commonly Kulattha. Dvivedagaṅga adds that A*n*u is
called in Guzerat Moriya, Priyaṅgu Kaṅgu, Khalva, as nishpâva, Valla,
and Khalakula Kulattha.
