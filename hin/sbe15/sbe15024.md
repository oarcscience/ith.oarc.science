### THIRD ANUVÂKA.

1\. May glory come to both of us (teacher and pupil) together! May Vedic
light belong to both of us!

Now let us explain the Upanishad (the secret meaning) of the union
(sa*m*hitâ) <span id="fr_200"></span>[2](#fn_200), under five heads,
with regard to the worlds, the heavenly lights, knowledge, offspring,
and self (body). People call these the great Sa*m*hitâs.

First, with regard to the worlds. The earth is the former element,
heaven the latter, ether their union;

2\. That union takes place through Vâyu (air). So much with regard to
the worlds.

Next, with regard to the heavenly lights. Agni (fire) is the former
element, Âditya (the sun) the latter, water their union. That union
takes place through lightning. So much with regard to the heavenly
lights.

Next, with regard to knowledge. The teacher is the former element,

The pupil the latter, knowledge their union. That union takes place
through the recitation of the Veda. So much with regard to knowledge.

Next, with regard to offspring. The mother is

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

the former element, the father the latter, offspring their union. That
union takes place through procreation. So much with regard to offspring.

4\. Next, with regard to the self (body). The lower jaw is the former
element, the upper jaw the latter, speech their union. That union takes
place through speech. So much with regard to the Self. These are the
great Sa*m*hitâs. He who knows these Sa*m*hitâs (unions), as here
explained, becomes united with offspring, cattle, Vedic light, food, and
with the heavenly world.
