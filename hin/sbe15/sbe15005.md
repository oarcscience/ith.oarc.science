## III.

## THE TAITTIRÎYAKA-UPANISHAD.

THE Taittirîyaka-upanishad seems to have had its original place in the
Taittirîya-Âra*n*yaka. This Âra*n*yaka consists, as Rajendralal Mitra
has shown in the Introduction to his edition of the work in the
Bibliotheca Indica, of three portions. Out of its ten Prapâ*th*akas, the
first six form the Âra*n*yaka proper, or the Karma-kâ*nd*a, as Sâya*n*a
writes. Then follow Prapâ*th*akas VII, VIII, and IX, forming the
Taittirîyaka-upanishad; and lastly, the tenth Prapâ*th*aka, the
Yâ*gñ*ikî or Mahânârâya*n*a-upanishad, which is called a Khila, and was
therefore considered by the Brâhmans themselves as a later and
supplementary work.

*S*aṅkara, in his commentary on the Taittirîyaka-upanishad, divides his
work into three Adhyâyas, and calls the first *S*ikshâ-vallî, the second
the Brahmânanda-vallî, while he gives no special name to the Upanishad
explained in the third Adhyâya. This, however, may be due to a mere
accident, for whenever the division of the Taittirîyaka-upanishad into
Vallîs is mentioned, we always have three <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md), the

<span id="page_xxviii">p. xxviii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *S*ikshâ-vallî,
the Brahmânanda-vallî, and the Bh*ri*gu-vallî <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md). Properly, however, it is only the second
Anuvâka of the seventh Prapâ*th*aka which deserves and receives in the
text itself the name of *S*ikshâdhyâya, while the rest of the first
Vallî ought to go by the name of Sa*m*hitâ-upanishad <span
id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25.md), or Sâ*m*hitî-upanishad.

Sâya*n*a <span id="fr_26"></span>[3](#fn_26.md), in his commentary on the
Taittirîya-âra*n*yaka, explains the seventh chapter, the *S*ikshâdhyâya
(twelve anuvâkas), as Sâ*m*hitî-upanishad. His commentary, however, is
called *S*ikshâ-bhâshya. The same Sâya*n*a treats the eighth and ninth
Prapâ*th*akas as the Vâru*n*y-upanishad <span
id="fr_27"></span>[4](#fn_27.md).

The Ânanda-vallî and Bh*ri*gu-vallî are quoted among the Upanishads of
the Âtharvana <span id="fr_28"></span>[5](#fn_28.md).

At the end of each Vallî there is an index of the Anuvâkas which it
contains. That at the end of the first Vallî is intelligible. It gives
the Pratîkas, i.e. the initial words, of each Anuvâka, and states their
number as twelve. At the end of the first Anuvâka, we have the final
words 'satyam vadishyâmi,' and pa*ñk*a *k*a, i.e. five short paragraphs
at the end. At the end of the second Anuvâka, where we expect the final
words, we have the initial, i.e. *s*îkshâm, and then pa*ñk*a, i.e. five
sections in the Anuvâka. At the end of the third Anuvâka, we have the
final words, but no number of sections. At the end of the fourth
Anuvâka, we have the final words of the three sections, followed by one
paragraph; at the end of the fifth Anuvâka, three final words, and two
paragraphs, though the first paragraph belongs clearly to the third
section. In the sixth Anuvâka, we have the final words of the two
Anuvâkas, and one paragraph. In the seventh Anuvâka, there is the final
word

<span id="page_xxix">p. xxix</span>

sarvam, and one paragraph added. In the eighth Anuvâka, we have the
initial word, and the number of sections, viz. ten. In the ninth
Anuvâka, there are the final words of one section, and six paragraphs.
In the tenth Anuvâka, there is the initial word, and the number of
paragraphs, viz. six. In the eleventh Anuvâka, we have the final words
of four sections, and seven paragraphs, the first again forming an
integral portion of the last section. The twelfth Anuvâka has one
section, and five paragraphs. If five, then the *s*ânti would here have
to be included, while, from what is said afterwards, it is clear that as
the first word of the Vallî is *s*am na*h*, so the last is vaktâram.

In the second Vallî the index to each Anuvâka is given at the end of the
Vallî.

1st Anuvâka: pratîka: brahmavid, and some other catchwords, idam, ayam,
idam. Number of sections, 21.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_23"></span>[xxvii:1](sbe15005.htm#fr_23.md) *S*aṅkara (ed.
Roer, p. 141) himself speaks of two Vallîs, teaching the
paramâtma*gñ*âna (the *S*ikshâ-vallî has nothing to do with this), and
Anquetil has Anandbli = Ânanda-vallî, and Bharkbli = Bhrigu-vallî.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[xxviii:1](sbe15005.htm#fr_24.md) The third Vallî
ends with Bh*ri*gur ity upanishat.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[xxviii:2](sbe15005.htm#fr_25.md) See
Taittirîyaka-upanishad, ed. Roer, p. 12.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[xxviii:3](sbe15005.htm#fr_26.md) See M. M.,
Alphabetisches Verzeichniss der Upanishads, p. 144.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[xxviii:4](sbe15005.htm#fr_27.md) The Anukrama*n*î
of the Âtreyî school (see Weber, Indische Studien, II, p. 208) of the
Taittirîyaka gives likewise the name of Vâru*n*î to the eighth and ninth
Prapâ*th*aka, while it calls the seventh Prapâ*th*aka the Sâmhitî, and
the tenth Prapâ*th*aka the Yâ*gñ*ki-upanishad. That Anukramanî
presupposes, however, a different text, as may be seen both from the
number of Anuvâkas, and from the position assigned to the Yâ*gñ*ki as
between the Sâmhitî and Vârunî Upanishads.
