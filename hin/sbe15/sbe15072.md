### NINTH BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_421"></span>[1](#fn_421).

1\. Then Vidagdha *S*âkalya asked him <span
id="fr_422"></span>[2](#fn_422): 'How many gods are there, O
Yâ*gñ*avalkya?' He replied with this very Nivid <span
id="fr_423"></span>[3](#fn_423): 'As many as are mentioned in the Nivid
of the hymn of praise addressed to the Vi*s*vedevas, viz. three and
three hundred, three and three thousand <span
id="fr_424"></span>[4](#fn_424).'

'Yes,' he said, and asked again: 'How many gods are there really, O
Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'

'Thirty-three,' he said.

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

'Yes,' he said, and asked again: 'How many gods are there really, O
Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'

'Six,' he said.

'Yes,' he said, and asked again: 'How many gods are there really, O
Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'

'Three,' he said.

'Yes,' he said, and asked again: 'How many gods are there really, O
Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'

'Two,' he said.

'Yes,' he said, and asked again: 'How many gods are there really, O
Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'

'One and a half (adhyardha),' he said.

'Yes,' he said, and asked again: 'How many gods are there really, O
Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'

'One,' he said.

'Yes,' he said, and asked: 'Who are these three and three hundred, three
and three thousand?'

2\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'They are only the various powers of them, in
reality there are only thirty-three gods <span
id="fr_425"></span>[1](#fn_425).'

He asked: 'Who are those thirty-three?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'The eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras, the twelve
Âdityas. They make thirty-one, and Indra and Pra*g*âpati make the
thirty-three <span id="fr_426"></span>[2](#fn_426).'

3\. He asked: 'Who are the Vasus.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'Agni (fire), P*ri*thivî (earth), Vâyu (air),
Antariksha (sky), Âditya (sun), Dyu (heaven), *K*andramas (moon), the
Nakshatras (stars), these are the Vasus, for in them all that dwells
(this world) <span id="fr_427"></span>[3](#fn_427) rests; and therefore
they are called Vasus.'

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

4\. He asked: 'Who are the Rudras?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'These ten vital breaths (prâ*n*as, the senses,
i.e. the five *gñ*ânendriyas, and the five karmendriyas), and
Âtman <span id="fr_428"></span>[1](#fn_428), as the eleventh. When they
depart from this mortal body, they make us cry (rodayanti), and because
they make us cry, they are called Rudras.'

5\. He asked: 'Who are the Âdityas?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'The twelve months of the year, and they are
Âdityas, because they move along (yanti), taking up everything <span
id="fr_429"></span>[2](#fn_429) (âdadânâ*h*). Because they move along,
taking up everything, therefore they are called Âdityas.'

6\. He asked: 'And who is Indra, and who is Pra*g*âpati?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'Indra is thunder, Pra*g*âpati is the sacrifice.'

He asked: 'And what is the thunder?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'The thunderbolt.'

He asked: 'And what is the sacrifice?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'The (sacrificial) animals.'

7\. He asked: 'Who are the six?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'Agni (fire), P*ri*thivî (earth), Vâyu (air),
Antariksha (sky), Âditya (sun), Dyu (heaven), they are the six, for they
are all <span id="fr_430"></span>[3](#fn_430) this, the six.'

8\. He asked: 'Who are the three gods?'

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'These three worlds, for in them all these gods
exist.'

He asked: 'Who are the two gods?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'Food and breath.'

He asked: 'Who is the one god and a half?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'He that blows.'

9\. Here they say: 'How is it that he who blows like one only, should be
called one and a half (adhyardha)?' And the answer is: 'Because, when
the wind was blowing, everything grew (adhyardhnot).'

He asked: 'Who is the one god?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'Breath (prâ*n*a), and he is Brahman (the
Sûtrâtman), and they call him That (tyad).'

10\. *S*âkalya said <span id="fr_431"></span>[1](#fn_431): 'Whosoever
knows that person (or god) whose dwelling (body) is the earth, whose
sight (world) is fire <span id="fr_432"></span>[2](#fn_432), whose mind
is light,--the principle

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

of every (living) self, he indeed is a teacher, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'I know that person, the principle of every self, of
whom thou speakest. This corporeal (material, earthy) person, "he is
he." But tell me <span id="fr_433"></span>[1](#fn_433), *S*âkalya, who
is his devatâ <span id="fr_434"></span>[2](#fn_434) (deity)?'

*S*âkalya replied: 'The Immortal <span id="fr_435"></span>[3](#fn_435).'

11\. *S*âkalya said: 'Whosoever knows that person whose dwelling is love
(a body capable of sensual love), whose sight is the heart, whose mind
is light.--the principle of every self, he indeed is a teacher, O
Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'I know that person, the principle of every self,
of whom thou speakest. This love-made (loving) person, he is he." But
tell me, *S*âkalya, who is his devatâ?'

*S*âkalya replied: 'The women <span id="fr_436"></span>[4](#fn_436).'

12\. *S*âkalya said: 'Whosoever knows that person whose dwelling are the
colours, whose sight is the eye, whose mind is light,--the principle of
every self, he indeed is a teacher, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'I know that person, the principle of every self,
of whom thou speakest. That person in the sun, "he is he." But tell me,
*S*âkalya, who is his devatâ?'

*S*âkalya replied: 'The True <span id="fr_437"></span>[5](#fn_437).'

13\. *S*âkalya said: 'Whosoever knows that person

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

whose dwelling is ether, whose sight is the ear, whose mind is
light,--the principle of every self, he indeed is a teacher, O
Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'I know that person, the principle of every self,
of whom thou speakest. The person who hears <span
id="fr_438"></span>[1](#fn_438) and answers, "he is he." But tell me,
*S*âkalya, who is his devatâ?'

*S*âkalya replied: 'Space.'

14\. *S*âkalya said: 'Whosoever knows that person whose dwelling is
darkness, whose sight is the heart, whose mind is light,--the principle
of every self, he indeed is a teacher, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'I know that person, the principle of every self,
of whom thou speakest. The shadowy <span id="fr_439"></span>[2](#fn_439)
person, "he is he." But tell me, *S*âkalya, who is his devatâ?'

*S*âkalya replied: 'Death.'

15\. *S*âkalya said: 'Whosoever knows that person whose dwelling are
(bright) colours, whose sight is the eye, whose mind is light,--the
principle of every self, he indeed is a teacher, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'I know that person, the principle of every self,
of whom thou speakest. The person in the looking-glass, "he is he." But
tell me, *S*âkalya, who is his devatâ?'

*S*âkalya replied: 'Vital breath' (asu).

16\. *S*âkalya said: 'Whosoever knows that person whose dwelling is
water, whose sight is the heart, whose mind is light,--the principle of
every self, he indeed is a teacher, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'I know that person, the principle of every self,
of whom thou speakest. The person in the water, "he is he." But tell me,
*S*âkalya, who is his devatâ?'

*S*âkalya replied: 'Varu*n*a.'

17\. *S*âkalya said: 'Whosoever knows that person whose dwelling is
seed, whose sight is the heart, whose mind is light,--the principle of
every self, he indeed is a teacher, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'I know that person, the principle of every self,
of whom thou speakest. The filial person, "he is he." But tell me,
*S*âkalya, who is his devatâ?'

*S*âkalya replied: 'Pra*g*âpati.'

18\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: '*S*âkalya, did those Brâhma*n*as (who
themselves shrank from the contest) make thee the victim <span
id="fr_440"></span>[1](#fn_440)?'

*S*âkalya said: 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya, because thou hast decried the
Brâhma*n*as of the Kuru-Pa*ñk*âlas, what <span
id="fr_441"></span>[2](#fn_441) Brahman dost thou know?'

19\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'I know the quarters with their deities and
their abodes.'

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

*S*âkalya said: 'If thou knowest the quarters with their deities and
their abodes,

20\. 'Which is thy deity in the Eastern quarter?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'Âditya (the sun).'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does that Âditya abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the eye.'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does the eye abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the colours, for with the eye he sees the
colours.'

*S*âkalya said: 'And in what then do the colours abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the heart <span id="fr_442"></span>[1](#fn_442),
for we know colours by the heart, for colours abide in the heart <span
id="fr_443"></span>[2](#fn_443).'

*S*âkalya said: 'So it is indeed, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

21\. *S*âkalya said: 'Which is thy deity in the Southern quarter?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'Yama.'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does that Yama abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the sacrifice.'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does the sacrifice abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the Dakshi*n*â (the gifts to be given to the
priests).'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does the Dakshi*n*â abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In Sraddhâ (faith), for if a man believes, then he
gives Dakshi*n*â, and Dakshi*n*â truly abides in faith.'

*S*âkalya said: 'And in what then does faith abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the heart, for by the heart faith knows, and
therefore faith abides in the heart.'

*S*âkalya said: 'So it is indeed, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

22\. *S*âkalya said: 'Which is thy deity in the Western quarter?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'Varu*n*a.'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does that Varu*n*a abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the water.'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does the water abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the seed.'

*S*âkalya said: 'And in what does the seed abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the heart. And therefore also they say of a son
who is like his father, that he seems as if slipt from his heart, or
made from his heart; for the seed abides in the heart.'

*S*âkalya said: 'So it is indeed, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

23\. *S*âkalya said: 'Which is thy deity in the Northern quarter?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'Soma.'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does that Soma abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the Dîkshâ <span
id="fr_444"></span>[1](#fn_444).'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does the Dîkshâ abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the True; and therefore they say to one who has
performed the Dîkshâ, Speak what is true, for in the True indeed the
Dîkshâ abides.'

*S*âkalya said: 'And in what does the True abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the heart, for with the heart do we know what is
true, and in the heart indeed the True abides.'

*S*âkalya said: 'So it is indeed, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

24\. *S*âkalya said: 'Which is thy deity in the zenith?'

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'Agni.'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does that Agni abide.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In speech.'

*S*âkalya said: 'And in what does speech abide

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the heart.'

*S*âkalya said: 'And in what does the heart abide?'

2 5. Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'O Ahallika <span
id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_445), when you think the heart could be
anywhere else away from us, if it were away from us, the dogs might eat
it, or the birds tear it.'

26\. *S*âkalya said: 'And in what dost thou (thy body) and the Self (thy
heart) abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the Prâ*n*a (breath).'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does the Prâ*n*a abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: In the Apâna (down-breathing) <span
id="fr_446"></span>[2](#fn_446).'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does the Apâna abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the Vyâna (back-breathing ) <span
id="fr_447"></span>[3](#fn_447).'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does the Vyâna-abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the Udâna (the out-breathing) <span
id="fr_448"></span>[4](#fn_448).'

*S*âkalya said: 'In what does the Udâna abide?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'In the Samâna <span
id="fr_449"></span>[5](#fn_449). That Self

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (âtman) is to be
described by No, no <span id="fr_450"></span>[1](#fn_450)! He is
incomprehensible, for he cannot be (is not) comprehended; he is
imperishable, for he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not
attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he does not fail.'

'These are the eight abodes (the earth, &c.), the eight worlds (fire,
&c.), the eight gods (the immortal food, &c.), the eight persons (the
corporeal, &c.) He who after dividing and uniting these persons <span
id="fr_451"></span>[2](#fn_451), went beyond (the Samâna), that person,
taught in the Upanishads, I now ask thee (to teach me). If thou shalt
not explain him to me, thy head will fall.'

*S*âkalya did not know him, and his head fell, nay, thieves took away
his bones, mistaking them for something else.

27\. Then Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'Reverend Brâhma*n*as, whosoever among you
desires to do so, may now question me. Or question me, all of you. Or
whosoever among you desires it, I shall question him, or I shall
question all of you.

But those Brâhma*n*as durst not (say anything).

28\. Then Yâ*gñ*avalkya questioned them with these *S*lokas:

1\. 'As a mighty tree in the forest, so in truth is man, his hairs are
the leaves, his outer skin is the bark.

2\. 'From his skin flows forth blood, sap from the skin (of the tree);
and thus from the wounded

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

man <span id="fr_452"></span>[1](#fn_452) comes forth blood, as from a
tree that is struck.

3\. 'The lumps of his flesh are (in the tree) the layers of wood, the
fibre is strong like the tendons <span id="fr_453"></span>[2](#fn_453) .
The bones are the (hard) wood within, the marrow is made like the marrow
of the tree.

4\. 'But, while the tree, when felled, grows up again more young from
the root, from what root, tell me, does a mortal grow up, after he has
been felled by death?

5\. 'Do not say, "from seed," for seed is produced from the living <span
id="fr_454"></span>[3](#fn_454); but a tree, springing from a grain,
clearly <span id="fr_455"></span>[4](#fn_455) rises again after
death <span id="fr_456"></span>[5](#fn_456).

6\. 'If a tree is pulled up with the root, it will not grow again; from
what root then, tell me, does a mortal grow up, after he has been felled
by death?

7\. 'Once born, he is not born (again); for who should create him
again <span id="fr_457"></span>[6](#fn_457)?'

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

'Brahman, who is knowledge and bliss, he is the principle, both to him
who gives gifts <span id="fr_458"></span>[1](#fn_458), and also to him
who stands firm, and knows.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_421"></span>[139:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_421) Mâdhyandina text,
p. 1076.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[139:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_422) This disputation
between Yâ*gñ*avalkya and Vidagdha *S*âkalya occurs in a simpler form in
the *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a, XI, p. 873. He is here represented as the
first who defies Yâ*gñ*avalkya, and whom Yâ*gñ*avalkya asks at once,
whether the other Brâhmans had made him the ulmukâvakshaya*n*a, the
cat's paw, literally one who has to take a burning piece of wood out of
the fire (ardha. dagdhakâsh*th*am ulmukam; tasya vahirnirasanam
avakshaya*n*a*m* vinâ*s*a*h*). The end, however, is different, for on
asking the nature of the one god, the Prâ*n*a, he is told by
Yâ*gñ*avalkya that he has asked for what he ought not to ask, and that
therefore he will die and thieves will carry away his bones.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[139:3](sbe15072.htm#fr_423) Nivid, old and
short invocations of the gods; devatâsaṅkhyâvâ*k*akâni mantrapâdni
kâni*k*id vai*s*vadeve *s*astre *s*asyante. *S*aṅkara, and Dvivedagaṅga.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[139:4](sbe15072.htm#fr_424) This would make
3306 devatâs.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[140:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_425) 'The glories of
these are three and thirty.' Gough, p. 172.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[140:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_426) Trayastri*ms*au,
i.e. trayastri*ms*ata*h* pûra*n*au.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[140:3](sbe15072.htm#fr_427) The etymological
explanation of Vasu is not quite clear, and <span id="page_141">p.
141</span> the commentator hardly explains our text. Perhaps vasu is
meant for the world or the dwellers therein. The more usual explanation
occurs in the *S*atap. Brâh. p. 1077, ete hîda*m* sarva*m* vâsayante
tadyad ida*m* sarva*m* vâsayante tasmâd vasava iti; or on p. 874, where
we read te yad ida*m* sarvam &c.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[141:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_428) Âtman is here
explained as manas, the common sensory.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[141:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_429) The life of men,
and the fruits of their work.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[141:3](sbe15072.htm#fr_430) They are the
thirty-three gods.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[142:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_431) I prefer to
attribute this to *S*âkalya, who is still the questioner, and not
Yâ*gñ*avalkya; but I am not quite satisfied that I am right in this, or
in the subsequent distribution of the parts, assigned to each speaker.
If *S*âkalya is the questioner, then the sentence, veda vâ aha*m* tam
purusha*m* sarvasyâtmana*h* parâya*n*a*m* yam âttha, must belong to
Yâ*gñ*avalkya, because he refers to the words of another speaker.
Lastly, the sentence vadaiva has to be taken as addressed to *S*âkalya.
The commentator remarks that, he being the questioner, one expects
pri*kkh*a instead of vada. But Yâ*gñ*avalkya may also be supposed to
turn round on *S*âkalya and ask him a question in turn, more difficult
than the question addressed by *S*âkalya to Yâ*gñ*avalkya, and in that
case the last sentence must be taken as an answer, though an imperfect
one, of *S*âkalya's. The commentator seems to think that after
Yâ*gñ*avalkya told *S*âkalya to ask this question, *S*âkalya was
frightened and asked it, and that then Yâ*gñ*avalkya answered in turn.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[142:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_432) The Mâdhyandina
text varies considerably. It has the first time, *k*ashur loka*h* for
agnir loka*h*. I keep to the same construction throughout, taking mano
*g*yoti*h*, not as a compound, but like agnir loko yasya, as a sentence,
i.e. mano *g*yotir yasya.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[143:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_433) Ask me. Comm.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[143:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_434) That from which he
is produced, that is his devatâ. Comm.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[143:3](sbe15072.htm#fr_435) According to the
commentator, the essence of food, which produces blood, from which the
germ receives life and becomes an embryo and a living being.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[143:4](sbe15072.htm#fr_436) Because they
excite the fire of love. Comm.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[143:5](sbe15072.htm#fr_437) The commentator
explains satya, the true, by the eye, because the sun owes its origin to
the eye.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[144:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_438) Read *s*rautra
instead of *s*rotra; see B*ri*h. Âr. Up. II, 5, 6.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[144:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_439) Shadow, *kh*âyâ,
is explained here by a*gñ*âna, ignorance, not by *gñ*âna, knowledge.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[145:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_440) Aṅgârâvakshaya*n*a
is explained as a vessel in which coals are extinguished, and Ânandagiri
adds that Yâ*gñ*avalkya, in saying that *S*âkalya was made an
aṅgârâvakshaya*n*a by his fellow Brâhmans, meant that he was given up by
them as a victim, in fact that he was being burnt or consumed by
Yâ*gñ*avalkya. I should prefer to take aṅgârâvakshaya*n*a in the sense
of ulmukâvakshaya*n*a, an instrument with which one takes burning coals
from the fire to extinguish them, a pair of tongs. Read sanda*m*sa
instead of sandesa. Kshi with ava means to remove, to take away. We
should call an aṅgârâvakshaya*n*a a cat's paw. The Brâhma*n*as used
*S*âkalya as a cat's paw.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[145:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_441) It seems better to
take kim as the interrogative pronoun than as an interrogative particle.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[146:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_442) Heart stands here
for buddhi and manas together. Comm.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[146:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_443) In the text,
published by Dr. Roer in the Bibliotheca Indica, a sentence is left out,
viz. h*ri*daya ity uvâ*k*a, h*ri*dayena hi rûpâ*n*i *g*ânâti, h*ri*daye
hy eva rûpâ*n*i pratish*th*itâni bhavantîty.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[147:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_444) Dîkshâ is the
initiatory rite for the Soma sacrifice. Having sacrificed with Soma
which has to be bought, the sacrificer becomes endowed with wisdom, and
wanders to the North, which is the quarter of Soma.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[148:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_445) A term of
reproach, it may be a ghost or preta, because ahani lîyate, it
disappears by day.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[148:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_446) Because the
prâ*n*a would run away, if it were not held back by the apâna.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[148:3](sbe15072.htm#fr_447) Because the apâna
would run down, and the prâ*n*a up, if they were not held back by the
vyâna.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[148:4](sbe15072.htm#fr_448) Because all three,
the prâ*n*a, apâna, and vyâna, would run away in all directions, if they
were not fastened to the udâna.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[148:5](sbe15072.htm#fr_449) The Samâna can
hardly be meant here for one of the five prâ*n*as, generally mentioned
before the udâna, but, as explained by Dvivedagaṅga, stands for the
Sûtrâtman. This Sûtrâtman abides in the Antaryâmin, and this in the
Brahman (Kû*t*astha), which is <span id="page_149">p. 149</span>
therefore described next. Could Samâna be here the same as in IV, 3, 7?

<span id="fn_450"></span>[149:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_450) See before, II, 3,
6; also IV, 2, 4; IV, 4, 22; IV, 5, 115.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[149:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_451) Dividing them
according to the different abodes, worlds, and persons, and uniting them
at last in the heart.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[150:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_452) In the
Mâdhyandina-*s*âkhâ, p. 1080, tasmât tadâtunnât, instead of tasmât
tadât*rinn*ât.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[150:2](sbe15072.htm#fr_453) *S*aṅkara seems to
have read snâvavat, instead of snâva, tat sthiram, as we read in both
*S*âkhâs.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[150:3](sbe15072.htm#fr_454) Here the
Mâdhyandinas (p. 1080) add, *g*âta eva na *g*âyate, ko nv ena*m*
*g*anayet puna*h*, which the Kâ*n*vas place later.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[150:4](sbe15072.htm#fr_455) Instead of
a*ñg*asâ, the Mâdhyandinas have anyata*h*.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[150:5](sbe15072.htm#fr_456) The Mâdhyandinas
have dhânâruha u vai, which is better than iva vai, the iva being,
according to *S*aṅkara's own confession, useless. The thread of the
argument does not seem to have been clearly perceived by the
commentators. What the poet wants to say is, that a man, struck down by
death, does not come to life again from seed, because human seed comes
from the living only, while trees, springing from grain, are seen to
come to life after the tree (which yielded the grain or the seed) is
dead. Pretya-sambhava like pretya-bhâva, means life after death, and
pretyasambhava, as an adjective, means coming to life after death.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[150:6](sbe15072.htm#fr_457) This line too is
taken in a different sense by the commentator. According to him, it
would mean: 'If you say, He has been born <span id="page_151">p.
151</span> (and there is an end of all questioning), I say, No; he is
born again, and the question is, How?' This is much too artificial. The
order of the verses in the Mâdhyandina-*s*âkhâ is better on the whole,
leading up more naturally to the question, 'From what root then does a
mortal grow up, after he has been felled by death?' When the Brâhmans
cannot answer, Yâ*gñ*avalkya answers, or the *S*ruti declares, that the
root from whence a mortal springs again, after death, is Brahman.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[151:1](sbe15072.htm#fr_458) *S*aṅkara explains
râtir dâtu*h* as râter dâtu*h*, a reading adopted by the Mâdhyandinas.
He then arrives at the statement that Brahman is the principle or the
last source, also the root of a new life, both for those who practise
works and for those who, having relinquished works, stand firm in
knowledge. Regnaud (II, p. 138) translates: 'C'est Brahma (qui est)
l'intelligence, le bonheur, la richesse, le but suprême de celui qui
offre (des sacrifices), et de celui qui réside (en lui), de celui qui
connaît.'
