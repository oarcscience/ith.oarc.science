## SECOND ADHYÂYA.

### FOURTH VALLÎ.

1\. Death said: 'The Self-existent pierced the openings (of the senses)
so that they turn forward: therefore man looks forward, not backward
into himself. Some wise man, however, with his eyes closed and wishing
for immortality, saw the Self behind.'

2\. 'Children follow after outward pleasures, and fall into the snare of
wide-spread death. Wise men only, knowing the nature of what is
immortal, do not look for anything stable here among things unstable.'

3\. 'That by which we know form, taste, smell, sounds, and loving
touches, by that also we know what exists besides. This is that (which
thou hast asked for).'

4\. 'The wise, when he knows that that by which he perceives all objects
in sleep or in waking is the great omnipresent Self, grieves no more.'

5\. 'He who knows this living soul which eats honey (perceives objects)
as being the Self, always near, the Lord of the past and the future,
henceforward fears no more. This is that.'

6\. 'He who (knows) him <span id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119) who was
born first from

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

the brooding heat <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120) (for he was born
before the water), who, entering into the heart, abides therein, and was
perceived from the elements. This is that.'

7\. '(He who knows) Aditi also, who is one with all deities, who arises
with Prâ*n*a (breath or Hira*n*yagarbha), who, entering into the heart,
abides therein, and was born from the elements. This is that.'

8\. 'There is Agni (fire), the all-seeing, hidden in the two
fire-sticks, well-guarded like a child (in the womb) by the mother, day
after day to be adored by men when they awake and bring oblations. This
is that.'

9\. 'And that whence the sun rises, and whither it goes to set, there
all the Devas are contained, and no one goes beyond. This is that <span
id="fr_121"></span>[2](#fn_121).'

10\. 'What is here (visible in the world), the same is there (invisible
in Brahman); and what is there, the same is here. He who sees any
difference here (between Brahman and the world), goes from death to
death.'

11\. 'Even by the mind this (Brahman) is to be obtained, and then there
is no difference whatsoever. He goes from death to death who sees any
difference here.'

12\. 'The person (purusha), of the size of a thumb <span
id="fr_122"></span>[3](#fn_122), stands in the middle of the Self
(body?), as lord of the past and the future, and henceforward fears no
more. This is that.'

13\. 'That person, of the size of a thumb, is like a light without
smoke, lord of the past and the future, he is the same to-day and
to-morrow. This is that.'

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

14\. 'As rain-water that has fallen on a mountain-ridge runs down the
rocks on all sides, thus does he, who sees a difference between
qualities, run after them on all sides.'

15\. 'As pure water poured into pure water remains the same, thus, O
Gautama, is the Self of a thinker who knows.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_119"></span>[15:1](sbe15013.htm#fr_119) The first
manifestation of Brahman, commonly called Hira*n*yagarbha, which springs
from the tapas of Brahman. Afterwards only water and the rest of the
elements become manifested. The text of these verses is abrupt, possibly
corrupt. The two accusatives, tish*th*antam and tish*th*antim, seem to
me to require veda to be supplied from verse 4.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[16:1](sbe15013.htm#fr_120) Cf.
s*ri*sh*t*ikrama.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[16:2](sbe15013.htm#fr_121) Cf. V, 8.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[16:3](sbe15013.htm#fr_122) *S*vet. Up. III,
