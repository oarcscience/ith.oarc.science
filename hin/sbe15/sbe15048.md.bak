*The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SIXTH ANUVÂKA.

He perceived that bliss is Brahman, for from bliss these beings are
born; by bliss, when born, they live; into bliss they enter at their
death.

This is the knowledge of Bh*ri*gu and Varu*n*a <span
id="fr_237"></span>[1](sbe15050.htm#fn_237.md), exalted in the highest
heaven (in the heart). He who knows this becomes exalted, becomes rich
in food, and able to eat food (healthy), becomes great by offspring,
cattle, and the splendour of his knowledge (of Brahman), great by fame.
