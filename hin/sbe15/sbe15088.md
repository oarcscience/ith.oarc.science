Textual Heritage

### TENTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

1\. When the person goes away from this world, he comes to the wind.
Then the wind makes room for him, like the hole of a carriage wheel, and
through it he mounts higher. He comes to the sun. Then the sun makes
room for him, like the hole of a Lambara <span
id="fr_564"></span>[2](#fn_564.md), and through it he mounts higher. He
comes to the moon. Then the moon makes room for him, like the hole of a
drum, and through it he mounts higher, and arrives at the world where
there is no sorrow, no snow <span id="fr_565"></span>[3](#fn_565.md). There
he dwells eternal years.
