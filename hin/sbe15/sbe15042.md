### NINTH ANUVÂKA <span id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_231.md).

He who knows the bliss of that Brahman, from whence all speech, with the
mind, turns away unable to reach it, he fears nothing <span
id="fr_232"></span>[2](#fn_232.md).'

He does not distress himself with the thought, Why did I not do what is
good? Why did I do what is bad? He who thus knows these two (good and
bad), frees himself. He who knows both, frees himself <span
id="fr_233"></span>[3](#fn_233.md). This is the Upanishad <span
id="fr_234"></span>[4](#fn_234.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_231"></span>[63:1](sbe15042.htm#fr_231.md) Cf. II, 4.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[63:2](sbe15042.htm#fr_232.md) Even if there is no
fear from anything else, after the knowledge of Self and Brahman has
been obtained, it might be thought that fear might still arise from the
commission of evil deeds, and the omission of good works. Therefore the
next paragraphs have been added.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[63:3](sbe15042.htm#fr_233.md) The construction of
these two sentences is not clear to me.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[63:4](sbe15042.htm#fr_234.md) Here follows the
Anukrama*n*î, and in some MSS. the same invocation with which the next
Vallî begins.
