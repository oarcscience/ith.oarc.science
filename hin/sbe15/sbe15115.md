### FOURTH PRAPÂ*TH*AKA.

1\. The Vâlakhilyas, whose passions were subdued, approached him full of
amazement and said: 'O Saint, we bow before thee; teach thou, for thou
art the way, and there is no other for us. What process is there for the
elemental Self, by which, after leaving this (identity with the
elemental body), he obtains union <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[4](#fn_1005) with the (true.md) Self?' Pra*g*âpati
Kratu said to them:

2\. 'It has been said elsewhere: Like the waves in large rivers, that
which has been done before, cannot be turned back, and, like the tide of
the sea, the approach of death is hard to stem. Bound <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[5](#fn_1006.md) by the fetters of the fruits of good
and evil, like a cripple; without freedom, like a man in prison; beset
by many fears, like one standing before Yama (the judge of

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

the dead); intoxicated by the wine of illusion, like one intoxicated by
wine; rushing about, like one possessed by an evil spirit; bitten by the
world, like one bitten by a great serpent; darkened by passion, like the
night; illusory, like magic; false, like a dream; pithless, like the
inside of the Kadalî; changing its dress in a moment, like an
actor <span id="fr_1010"></span>[1](#fn_1007.md); fair in appearance, like
a painted wall, thus they call him; and therefore it is said:

Sound <span id="fr_1011"></span>[2](#fn_1008.md), touch, and other things
are like nothings; if the elemental Self is attached to them, it will
not remember the Highest Place <span id="fr_1012"></span>[3](#fn_1009.md).

3\. This is indeed the remedy for the elemental Self: Acquirement of the
knowledge of the Veda, performance of one's own duty, therefore
conformity on the part of each man to the order to which he happens to
belong. This <span id="fr_1013"></span>[4](#fn_1010.md) is indeed the rule
for one's own duty, other performances are like the mere branches of a
stem <span id="fr_1014"></span>[5](#fn_1011.md). Through it one obtains the
Highest above, otherwise one falls downward <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[6](#fn_1012.md). Thus is one's own duty declared,
which is to be found in the Vedas. No one belongs truly to an order
(â*s*rama) who transgresses his own law <span
id="fr_1016"></span>[7](#fn_1013.md). And if people say, that a man does
not belong to any of the orders, and that he is an ascetic <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[8](#fn_1014.md), this is wrong, though, on

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

the other hand, no one who is not an ascetic brings his sacrificial
works to perfection or obtains knowledge of the Highest Self <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[1](#fn_1015.md). For thus it is said:

By ascetic penance goodness is obtained, from goodness understanding is
reached, from understanding the Self is obtained, and he who has
obtained that, does not return <span id="fr_1019"></span>[2](#fn_1016.md).

4\. "Brahman is," thus said one who knew the science of Brahman; and
this penance is the door to Brahman, thus said one who by penance had
cast off all sin. The syllable Om is the manifest greatness of Brahman,
thus said one who well grounded (in Brahman) always meditates on it.
Therefore by knowledge, by penance, and by meditation is Brahman gained.
Thus one goes beyond <span id="fr_1020"></span>[3](#fn_1017.md) Brahman
(Hira*n*yagarbha), and to a divinity higher than the gods; nay, he who
knows this, and worships Brahman by these three (by knowledge, penance,
and meditation), obtains bliss imperishable, infinite, and unchangeable.
Then freed from those things (the senses of the body, &c.) by which he
was filled and overcome, a mere charioteer <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[4](#fn_1018.md), he obtains union with the Self.'

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

5\. The Vâlakhilyas said: 'O Saint, thou art the teacher, thou art the
teacher <span id="fr_1022"></span>[1](#fn_1019.md). What thou hast said,
has been properly laid up in our mind. Now answer us a further question:
Agni, Vâyu, Âditya, Time (kâla) which is Breath (prâ*n*a <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[2](#fn_1020)), Food (anna.md), Brahmâ <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[3](#fn_1021.md), Rudra, Vish*n*u, thus do some
meditate on one, some on another. Say which of these is the best for
us.' He said to them:

6\. 'These are but the chief manifestations of the highest, the
immortal, the incorporeal Brahman. He who is devoted to one, rejoices
here in his world (presence), thus he said. Brahman indeed is all this,
and a man may meditate on, worship, or discard also those which <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[4](#fn_1022.md) are its chief manifestations. With
these (deities) he proceeds to higher and higher worlds, and when all
things perish, he becomes one with the Purusha, yes, with the Purusha.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1002"></span>[299:1](sbe15114.htm#fr_1005.md) M. reads
vyavartatvam.

<span id="fn_1003"></span>[299:2](sbe15114.htm#fr_1006.md) It should be
ka*ñk*alatvam.

<span id="fn_1004"></span>[299:3](sbe15114.htm#fr_1007.md) M. reads
mattasvaro.

<span id="fn_1005"></span>[299:4](sbe15115.htm#fr_1008.md) Instead of the
irregular sâyo*g*yam, M. always reads sâyu*g*yam.

<span id="fn_1006"></span>[299:5](sbe15115.htm#fr_1009.md) It is not quite
clear what is the subject to which all these adjectives refer. M. reads
baddho for baddham, but afterwards agrees with the text as published by
Cowell.

<span id="fn_1007"></span>[300:1](sbe15115.htm#fr_1010.md) M. reads
na*t*avat.

<span id="fn_1008"></span>[300:2](sbe15115.htm#fr_1011.md) M. reads ye
'rthâ anarthâ iva te sthitâ*h*, esham.

<span id="fn_1009"></span>[300:3](sbe15115.htm#fr_1012.md) M. reads na
smaret paramam padam.

<span id="fn_1010"></span>[300:4](sbe15115.htm#fr_1013.md) M. reads
svadharma eva sarva*m* dhatte, stambha*s*âkhevetarâni.

<span id="fn_1011"></span>[300:5](sbe15115.htm#fr_1014.md) The commentator
considers the other sacrificial performances as hurtful, and to be
avoided.

<span id="fn_1012"></span>[300:6](sbe15115.htm#fr_1015.md) M. reads
anyathâdha*h* pataty, esha.

<span id="fn_1013"></span>[300:7](sbe15115.htm#fr_1016.md) The rules of the
order to which he belongs.

<span id="fn_1014"></span>[300:8](sbe15115.htm#fr_1017.md) A Tapasvin is
free from the restrictions of the preceding âsramas, <span
id="page_301">p. 301</span> but he must have obeyed them first, before
he can become a real Tapasvin.

<span id="fn_1015"></span>[301:1](sbe15115.htm#fr_1018.md) M. reads
â*s*rameshv evâvasthitas tapasvî *k*ety u*k*yata ity, etad apy uktam,
&c. This would mean, 'For it is said that he only who has dwelt in the
â*s*ramas is also called a Tapasvin, a real ascetic; and this also has
been said, that no one obtains self-knowledge except an ascetic.' This
is not impossible, but the commentator follows the text as printed by
Cowell. AI. reads âtma*gñ*ânenâdhigama*h*, karma*s*uddhi.

<span id="fn_1016"></span>[301:2](sbe15115.htm#fr_1019.md) M. reads manasâ
prâpyate tv âtmâ hy âtmâptyâ na nivartata iti.

<span id="fn_1017"></span>[301:3](sbe15115.htm#fr_1020.md) M. reads pura
eta, which may be right.

<span id="fn_1018"></span>[301:4](sbe15115.htm#fr_1021.md) Rathita*h* is a
very strange word, but, like everything else, it is <span
id="page_302">p. 302</span> explained by the commentator, viz. as ratham
prâpito rathitva*m* *k*a prâpita iti yâvat. Nevertheless the reading of
M. seems to me preferable, viz. atha yai*h* paripûr*n*o 'bhibhûto 'ya*m*
tathaitai*s* *k*a, tai*h* sarvair vimukta svâtmany eva sâyu*g*yam
upaiti. I should prefer vimuktas tv âtmany eva, and translate, 'But
then, freed from all those things by which he was filled and likewise
was overcome by them, he obtains union with the Self.'

<span id="fn_1019"></span>[302:1](sbe15115.htm#fr_1022.md) M. reads the
second time abhivâdy asmîti, which is no improvement. It might have been
ativâdyasîti.

<span id="fn_1020"></span>[302:2](sbe15115.htm#fr_1023.md) M. reads Yama*h*
prâ*n*o.

<span id="fn_1021"></span>[302:3](sbe15115.htm#fr_1024.md) This is, of
course, the personal Brahmâ of the Hindu triad. To distinguish this
personal Brahmâ from the impersonal, I sometimes give his name in the
nom. masc., Brahmâ, and not the grammatical base, Brahman.

<span id="fn_1022"></span>[302:4](sbe15115.htm#fr_1025.md) M. reads yâ vâ
asyâ. The commentator explains yâ vâsyâ*h* by vâsayogyâ*h*; or yâ vâ
yâ*h* by kâ*sk*it, admitting a Vedic irregularity which is not quite
clear.
