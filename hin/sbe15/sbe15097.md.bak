### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_623"></span>[2](#fn_623.md).

1\. The earth is the essence of all these things, water is the essence
of the earth, plants of water, flowers of plants, fruits of flowers, man
of fruits, seed of man.

2\. And Pra*g*âpati thought, let me make an abode for him, and he
created a woman (*S*atarûpâ).

6\. If a man see himself in the water <span
id="fr_632"></span>[8](#fn_632.md), he should

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

recite the following verse: 'May there be in me splendour, strength,
glory, wealth, virtue.'

She is the best of women whose garments are pure <span
id="fr_633"></span>[1](#fn_633.md). Therefore let him approach a woman
whose garments are pure, and whose fame is pure, and address her.

7\. If she do not give in <span id="fr_634"></span>[2](#fn_634.md), let
him, as he likes, bribe her (with presents). And if she then do not give
in, let him, as he likes, beat her with a stick or with his hand, and
overcome her <span id="fr_635"></span>[3](#fn_635.md), saying: 'With manly
strength and glory I take away thy glory,'--and thus she becomes
unglorious <span id="fr_636"></span>[4](#fn_636.md).

8\. If she give in, he says: 'With manly strength and glory I give thee
glory,'--and thus they both become glorious.

9\. Sa yâm i*kkh*et kâmayeta meti tasyâm artha*m* nish*t*âya <span

mukhena mukha*m* sandhâyâpânyâbhiprâ*n*yâd indriye*n*a te retâsa reta
âdadhâmîti garbhi*n*y eva bhavati.

12\. Now again, if a man's wife has a lover and the husband hates him,
let him (according to rule) <span id="fr_643"></span>[1](#fn_643.md) place
fire by an unbaked jar, spread a layer of arrows in inverse order <span
id="fr_644"></span>[2](#fn_644.md), anoint these three arrow-heads <span
id="fr_645"></span>[3](#fn_645.md) with butter in inverse order, and
sacrifice, saying: 'Thou hast sacrificed in my fire, I take away thy up
and down breathing, I here <span id="fr_646"></span>[4](#fn_646.md).'

'Thou hast sacrificed in my fire, I take away thy sons and cattle, I
here.'

'Thou hast sacrificed in my fire, I take away thy sacred and thy good
works, I here.'

'Thou hast sacrificed in my fire, I take away thy hope and expectation,
I here.'

He whom a Brâhma*n*a who knows this curses, departs from this world
without strength and without good works. Therefore let no one wish even
for sport with the wife of a *S*rotriya <span
id="fr_647"></span>[5](#fn_647.md) who knows this, for he who knows this,
is a dangerous enemy.

13\. When the monthly illness seizes his wife, she

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

should for three days not drink from a metal vessel, and wear a fresh
dress. Let no V*ri*shala or V*ri*shalî (a *S*ûdra man or woman) touch
her. At the end of the three days, when she has bathed, the husband
should make her pound rice <span id="fr_648"></span>[1](#fn_648.md).

14\. And if a man wishes that a white son should be born to him, and
that he should know one Veda, and live to his full age, then, after
having prepared boiled rice with milk and butter, they should both eat,
being fit to have offspring.

15\. And if a man wishes that a reddish <span
id="fr_649"></span>[2](#fn_649.md) son with tawny eyes should be born to
him, and that he should know two Vedas, and live to his full age, then,
after having prepared boiled rice with coagulated milk and butter, they
should both eat, being fit to have offspring.

16\. And if a man wishes that a dark son should be born to him with red
eyes, and that he should know three Vedas, and live to his full age,
then, after having prepared boiled rice with water and butter, they
should both eat, being fit to have offspring.

17\. And if a man wishes that a learned daughter should be born to him,
and that she should live to her full age, then, after having prepared
boiled rice with sesamum and butter, they should both eat, being fit to
have offspring.

18\. And if a man wishes that a learned son should be born to him,
famous, a public man, a popular speaker, that he should know all the
Vedas, and that

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

he should live to his full age, then, after having prepared boiled rice
with meat and butter, they should both eat, being fit to have offspring.
The meat should be of a young or of an old bull.

19\. And then toward morning, after having, according to the rule of the
Sthâlîpâka (pot-boiling), performed the preparation of the Â*g*ya
(clarified butter <span id="fr_650"></span>[1](#fn_650).md), he sacrifices
from the Sthâlîpâka bit by bit, saying: 'This is for Agni, Svâhâ! This
is for Anumati, Svâhâ! This is for the divine Savit*ri*, the true
creator, Svâhâ!' Having sacrificed, he takes out the rest of the rice
and eats it, and after having eaten, he gives it to his wife. Then he
washes his hands, fills a water-jar, and sprinkles her thrice with it,
saying: 'Rise hence, O Vi*s*vâvasu <span
id="fr_651"></span>[2](#fn_651.md), seek another blooming girl, a wife with
her husband.'

20\. Then he embraces her, and says: 'I am Ama (breath), thou art Sâ
(speech) <span id="fr_652"></span>[3](#fn_652). Thou art Sâ (speech.md), I
am Ama (breath). I am the Sâman, thou art the *Rik* <span
id="fr_653"></span>[4](#fn_653.md). I am the sky, thou art the earth. Come,
let us strive together, that a male child may be begotten <span
id="fr_654"></span>[5](#fn_654.md).'

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

24 <span id="fr_665"></span>[1](#fn_665.md). When the child is born, he
prepares the fire, places the child on his lap, and having poured
p*ri*shadâ*g*ya, i.e. dadhi (thick milk) mixed with gh*ri*ta (clarified
butter) into a metal jug, he sacrifices bit by bit of that
p*ri*shadâ*g*ya, saying: 'May I, as I increase in this my house, nourish
a thousand! May fortune never fail in his race, with offspring and
cattle, Svâhâ!'

'I offer to thee. in my mind the vital breaths which are in me, Svâhâ!'

'Whatever <span id="fr_666"></span>[2](#fn_666.md) in my work I have done
too much, or whatever I have here done too little, may the wise Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t make this right and proper for us, Svâhâ!'

25\. Then putting his mouth near the child's right ear, he says thrice,
Speech, speech <span id="fr_667"></span>[3](#fn_667.md)! After

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

that he pours together thick milk, honey, and clarified butter, and
feeds the child with (a ladle of) pure gold <span
id="fr_668"></span>[1](#fn_668.md), saying: 'I give thee Bhû*h*, I give
thee Bhuva*h*, I give thee Sva*h* <span id="fr_669"></span>[2](#fn_669.md).
Bhûr, Bhuva*h*, Sva*h*, I give thee all <span
id="fr_670"></span>[3](#fn_670.md).'

26 <span id="fr_671"></span>[4](#fn_671.md). Then he gives him his name,
saying: 'Thou art Veda;' but this is his secret name <span
id="fr_672"></span>[5](#fn_672.md).

27\. Then he hands the boy to his mother and gives him her breast,
saying: 'O Sarasvatî, that breast of thine which is inexhaustible,
delightful, abundant, wealthy, generous, by which thou cherishest all
blessings, make that to flow here <span
id="fr_673"></span>[6](#fn_673.md).'

28 <span id="fr_674"></span>[7](#fn_674.md). Then he addresses the mother
of the boy:

<span id="page_224a">p. 224a</span>

'Thou art I*l*â Maitrâvaru*n*î: thou strong woman hast born a strong
boy. Be thou blessed with strong children thou who hast blessed me with
a strong child.'

And they say of such a boy: 'Ah, thou art better than thy father; ah,
thou art better than thy grandfather. Truly he has reached the highest
point in happiness, praise, and Vedic glory who is born as the son of a
Brâhma*n*a that knows this.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_622"></span>[215:1](sbe15096.htm#fr_622.md) According to the
rules laid down in the proper Grihya-sûtras.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[215:2](sbe15097.htm#fr_623.md) This Brâhma*n*a is
inserted here because there is supposed to be some similarity between
the preparation of the *S*rîmantha and the Putramantha, or because a
person who has performed the *S*rîmantha is fit to perform the
Putramantha. Thus *S*aṅkara says: Prâ*n*adar*s*ina*h* *s*rîmantha*m*
karma k*ri*tavata*h* putramanthe 'dhikâra*h*. Yadâ putramantha*m*
*k*ikîrshati tadâ srîmantha*m* k*ri*tvâ *ri*tukâla*m* patnyâ*h*
(brahma*k*arye*n*a) pratîkshata iti.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[215:3](sbe15097.htm#fr_624.md) I have given those
portions of the text which did not admit of translation into English, in
Sanskrit. It was not easy, however, to determine always the text of the
Kânva-*s*âkhâ. Poley's text is not always correct, and Roer seems simply
to repeat it. *S*aṅkara's commentary, which is meant for the Kânva text,
becomes very short towards the end of the Upanishad. It is quite
sufficient for the purpose of a translation, but by no means always for
restoring a correct text. MS. Wilson 369, which has been assigned to the
Kâ*n*va-*s*âkhâ, and which our Catalogue attributes to the same school,
gives the Mâdhyandina text, and so does MS. Mill 108. I have therefore
collated two MSS. of the India Office, which Dr. Rost had the kindness
to select for me, MS. 375 and MS. 1973, which I call A. and B.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[216:1](sbe15097.htm#fr_625.md) Roer reads
samidho, but *S*aṅkara and Dvivedagaṅga clearly presuppose samiddho,
which is in A. and B.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[216:2](sbe15097.htm#fr_626.md) Roer has âsâ*m* sa
strî*n*âm, Poley, A. and B. have âsâ*m* strî*n*âm. *S*aṅkara. (MS. Mill
64) read â sa strî*n*âm, and later on âsya striya*h*, though both Roer
and Poley leave out the â here too (â asyeti *kh*eda*h*).

<span id="fn_627"></span>[216:3](sbe15097.htm#fr_627.md) Brâhma*n*âyanâ*h*,
the same as brahmabandhava*h*, i.e. Brâhmans by descent only, not by
knowledge.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[216:6](sbe15097.htm#fr_630.md) The Mâdhyandina
text has agnayo, and Dvivedagaṅga explains it by dhîsh*n*yâ agnaya*h*
*s*arîrasthitâ*h*. Poley and Roer have punar agnir dhish*n*yâ, and so
have A. and B.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[216:7](sbe15097.htm#fr_631.md) Nirm*rig*yât, A.;
nim*riñg*yât, B.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[216:8](sbe15097.htm#fr_632.md) Dvivedagaṅga adds,

<span id="fn_634"></span>[217:2](sbe15097.htm#fr_634.md) Instead of
connecting kâmam with dadyât, Dvivedagaṅga explains it by yathâ*s*akti.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[217:8](sbe15097.htm#fr_640.md) Mâdayeti is the
reading of the Mâdhyandina text. Poley, Roer, A. and B. read mâdayemâm
amûm mayîti. Ânandagiri has m*ri*gîm ivâmûm madiyâ*m* striyam me mâdaya
madva*s*â*m* kurv ityartha*h*. Dvivedagaṅga explains mâdayeti.

dakshi*n*âgra*m* vâ yathâ syât tathâ.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[218:3](sbe15097.htm#fr_645.md) Tisra*h* is left
out by Roer and Poley, by A. and B.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[218:4](sbe15097.htm#fr_646.md) I have translated
according to the Kâ*n*va text, as far as it could be made out. As there
are four imprecations, it is but natural that tisra*h* should be left
out in the Kâ*n*va text. It is found in the Mâdhyandina text, because
there the imprecations are only three in number, viz. the taking away of
hope and expectation, of sons and cattle, and of up and down breathing.
Instead of asâv iti, which is sufficient, the Mâdhyandina text has asâv
iti nâma g*ri*h*n*âti, and both Ânandagiri and Dvivedagaṅga allow the
alternative, âtmana*h* *s*atror vâ nâma grih*n*âti, though asau can
really refer to the speaker only.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[218:5](sbe15097.htm#fr_647.md) Roer reads
dvâre*n*a; Poley, A. and B. dâre*n*a; the Mâdhyandinas <span
id="page_219">p. 219</span> *g*âyâyâ. *S*aṅkara, according to Roer,
interprets dvâre*n*a, but it seems that dvâre*n*a is used here in the
singular, instead of the plural. See Pâraskara G*ri*hya-sûtras I, 11.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[219:1](sbe15097.htm#fr_648.md) To be used for the
ceremony described in § 14 seq.

*s*rapayitvâ.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[220:2](sbe15097.htm#fr_651.md) Name of a
Gandharva, as god of love. See *Ri*g-veda X, 85, 22. Dvivedagaṅga
explains the verse differently, so that the last words imply, I come
together with my own wife.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[220:3](sbe15097.htm#fr_652.md) Because speech is
dependent on breath, as the wife is on the husband. See *Kh*ând. Up. I,
6, 1.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[220:4](sbe15097.htm#fr_653.md) Because the
Sâma-veda rests on the *Ri*g-veda.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[220:5](sbe15097.htm#fr_654.md) This is a verse
which is often quoted and explained. It occurs in the Atharva-veda XIV,
71, as 'amo 'ham asmi si tva*m*, sâmâham asmy *ri*k tvam, dyaur aham
p*ri*thivî tvam; tâv iha sam bhavâva pra*g*âm â ganayâvahai.'

Here we have the opposition between ama*h* and sâ, while in the Ait.
Brâhma*n*a VIII, 27, we have amo 'ham asmi sa tvam, giving ama*h* in
opposition to sa. It seems not unlikely that this <span id="page_221">p.
221</span> was an old proverbial formula, and that it meant originally
no more than 'I am he, and thou art she.' But this meaning was soon
forgotten. In the *Kh*ând. Up. I, 6, 1, we find sâ explained as earth,
ama as fire (Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. 13). In the Ait.
Brâhma*n*a sâ is explained as *Rik*, ama as Sâman. I have therefore in
our passage also followed the interpretation of the commentary, instead
of rendering it, 'I am he, and thou art she; thou art she, and I am he.'

<span id="fn_665"></span>[222:1](sbe15097.htm#fr_665.md) These as well as
the preceding rules refer to matters generally treated in the
G*ri*hya-sûtras; see Â*s*valâyana, G*ri*hya-sûtras I, 13 seq.;
Pâraskara, G*ri*hya-sûtras I, 11 seq.; *S*âṅkâkyana, G*ri*hya-sûtras I,
19 seq. It is curious, however, that Â*s*valâyana I, 13, 1, refers
distinctly to the Upanishad as the place where the pu*m*savana and
similar matters were treated. This shows that the Upanishads were known
before the composition of the G*ri*hya-sûtras, and explains perhaps, at
least partially, why the Upanishads were considered as rahasya.
Â*s*valâyana says, 'Conception, begetting of a boy, and guarding the
embryo are to be found in the Upanishad. But if a man does not read the
Upanishad, let him know that he should feed his wife,' &c. Nârâya*n*a
explains that Â*s*valâyana here refers to an Upanishad which does not
exist in his own *S*âkhâ, but he objects to the conclusion that
therefore the garbhâdhâna and other ceremonies need not be performed,
and adds that some hold it should be performed, as prescribed by
*S*aunaka and others.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[223:1](sbe15097.htm#fr_668.md) Cf. Pâraskara
G*ri*hya-sûtras I, 16, 4, anâmikayâ suvar*n*ântarhitayâ; *S*âṅkhâyana,

<span id="fn_669"></span>[223:2](sbe15097.htm#fr_669.md) Bhûr bhuva*h*
sva*h* are explained by Dvivedagaṅga as the *Ri*g-veda, Ya*g*ur-veda,
and Sâma-veda. They might also be earth, air, and heaven. See
*S*âṅkhâyana, G*ri*hya-sûtras 1, 24; Bhur *ri*gveda*m* tvayi dadhâmi,
&c.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[223:3](sbe15097.htm#fr_670.md) The Mâdhyandinas
add here another verse, which the father recites while he strokes his
boy: 'Be a stone, be an axe, be pure gold. Thou art my Self, called my
son; live a hundred harvests.' The same verse occurs in the Â*s*valâyana
G*ri*hya-sûtras I, 15, 3.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[223:4](sbe15097.htm#fr_671.md) The two
ceremonies, here described, are the âyushya-karman and the
medhâ*g*anana. They are here treated rather confusedly. Pâraskara
(G*ri*hya-sûtras I, 16, 3) distinguishes the medhâ*g*anana and the
âyushya. He treats the medhâ*g*anana first, which consists in feeding
the boy with honey and clarified butter, and saying to him bhûs tvayi
dadhâmi, &c. The âyushya consists in repeating certain verses in the
boy's ear, wishing him a long life, &c. In Â*s*valâyana's
G*ri*hya-sûtras, I, 15, 1 contains the âyushya, I, 15, 2 the
medhâganana. *S*âṅkhâyana also (I, 24) treats the âyushya first, and the
medhâ*g*anana afterwards, and the same order prevails in the Mâdhyandina
text of the B*ri*hadâranyaka-upanishad.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[223:5](sbe15097.htm#fr_672.md) In the Mâdhyandina
text these acts are differently arranged.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[223:6](sbe15097.htm#fr_673.md) *Ri*g-veda I, 164,
49.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[223:7](sbe15097.htm#fr_674.md) These verses are
differently explained by various commentators. Ânandagiri explains i*l*â
as stutyâ, bhogyâ. He derives Maitrâvaru*n*î <span id="page_224">p.
224</span> from Maitrâvaru*n*a, i.e. Vasish*th*a, the son of
Mitrâvaru*n*au, and identifies her with Arundhatî. Dvivedagaṅga takes
i*d*â as bhogyâ, or i*d*âpâtrî, or p*ri*thivîrûpâ, and admits that she
may be called Maitrâvaru*n*î, because born of Mitrâvaru*n*au. Vîre is
rightly taken as a vocative by Dvivedagaṅga, while Ânandagiri explains
it as a locative, mayi nimittabhûte. One expects a*g*î*g*ana*h* instead
of a*g*îganat, which is the reading of A. and B. The reading of the
Mâdhyandinas, â*g*î*g*anathâ*h*, is right grammatically, but it offends
against the metre, and is a theoretical rather than a real form. If we
read a*g*î*g*ana*h*, we must also read akara*h*, unless we are prepared
to follow the commentator, who supplies bhavatî.
