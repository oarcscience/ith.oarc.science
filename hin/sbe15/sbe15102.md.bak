### THIRD ADHYÂYA <span id="fr_750"></span>[1](#fn_748.md).

1\. The snarer <span id="fr_751"></span>[2](#fn_749.md) who rules alone by
his powers, who rules all the worlds by his powers, who is one and the
same, while things arise and exist <span
id="fr_752"></span>[3](#fn_750.md),--they who know this are immortal.

2\. For there is one Rudra only, they do not allow a second, who rules
all the worlds by his powers. He stands behind all persons <span
id="fr_753"></span>[4](#fn_751.md), and after having created all worlds he,
the protector, rolls it up <span id="fr_754"></span>[5](#fn_752.md) at the
end of time.

3 <span id="fr_755"></span>[6](#fn_753.md). That one god, having his eyes,
his face, his arms, and his feet in every place, when producing heaven
and earth, forges them together with his arms and his wings <span
id="fr_756"></span>[7](#fn_754.md).

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

4\. He <span id="fr_757"></span>[1](#fn_755.md), the creator and supporter
of the gods, Rudra, the great seer, the lord of all, he who formerly
gave birth to Hira*n*yagarbha, may he endow us with good thoughts.

5 <span id="fr_758"></span>[2](#fn_756.md). O Rudra, thou dweller in the
mountains, look upon us with that most blessed form of thine which is
auspicious, not terrible, and reveals no evil!

6 <span id="fr_759"></span>[3](#fn_757.md). O lord of the mountains, make
lucky that arrow which thou, a dweller in the mountains, holdest in thy
hand to shoot. Do not hurt man or beast!

7\. Those who know beyond this the High Brahman, the vast, hidden in the
bodies of all creatures, and alone enveloping everything, as the Lord,
they become immortal <span id="fr_760"></span>[4](#fn_758.md).

8 <span id="fr_761"></span>[5](#fn_759.md). I know that great person
(purusha) of sunlike lustre beyond the darkness <span
id="fr_762"></span>[6](#fn_760.md). A man who knows him truly, passes over
death; there is no other path to go <span
id="fr_763"></span>[7](#fn_761.md).

9\. This whole universe is filled by this person (purusha), to whom
there is nothing superior, from whom there is nothing different, than
whom there is

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

nothing smaller or larger, who stands alone, fixed like a tree in the
sky <span id="fr_764"></span>[1](#fn_762.md).

10\. That which is beyond this world is without form and without
suffering. They who know it, become immortal, but others suffer pain
indeed <span id="fr_765"></span>[2](#fn_763.md).

11\. That Bhagavat <span id="fr_766"></span>[3](#fn_764.md) exists in the
faces, the heads, the necks of all, he dwells in the cave (of the heart)
of all beings, he is all-pervading, therefore he is the omnipresent
*S*iva.

12\. That person (purusha) is the great lord; he is the mover of
existence <span id="fr_767"></span>[4](#fn_765.md), he possesses that
purest power of reaching everything <span
id="fr_768"></span>[5](#fn_766.md), he is light, he is undecaying.

13 <span id="fr_769"></span>[6](#fn_767). The person (purusha.md), not
larger than a thumb,

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

dwelling within, always dwelling in the heart of man, is perceived by
the heart, the thought <span id="fr_770"></span>[1](#fn_768.md), the mind;
they who know it become immortal.

14 <span id="fr_771"></span>[2](#fn_769). The person (purusha.md) with a
thousand heads. a thousand eyes, a thousand feet, having compassed the
earth on every side, extends beyond it by ten fingers' breadth.

15\. That person alone (purusha) is all this, what has been and what
will be; he is also the lord of immortality; he is whatever grows by
food <span id="fr_772"></span>[3](#fn_770.md).

16\. Its <span id="fr_773"></span>[4](#fn_771.md) hands and feet are
everywhere, its eyes and head are everywhere, its ears are everywhere,
it stands encompassing all in the world <span
id="fr_774"></span>[5](#fn_772.md).

17\. Separate from all the senses, yet reflecting the qualities of all
the senses, it is the lord and ruler of all, it is the great refuge of
all.

18\. The embodied spirit within the town with nine gates <span
id="fr_775"></span>[6](#fn_773.md), the bird, flutters outwards, the ruler
of

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

the whole world, of all that rests and of all that moves.

19\. Grasping without hands, hasting without feet, he sees without eyes,
he hears without ears. He knows what can be known, but no one knows him;
they call him the first, the great person (purusha).

20 <span id="fr_776"></span>[1](#fn_774.md). The Self, smaller than small,
greater than great, is hidden in the heart of the creature. A man who
has left all grief behind, sees the majesty, the Lord, the passionless,
by the grace of the creator (the Lord).

21 <span id="fr_777"></span>[2](#fn_775.md). I know <span
id="fr_778"></span>[3](#fn_776.md) this undecaying, ancient one, the self
of all things, being infinite and omnipresent. They declare that in him
all birth is stopped, for the Brahma-students proclaim him to be
eternal <span id="fr_779"></span>[4](#fn_777.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_748"></span>[244:1](sbe15102.htm#fr_750.md) This Adhyâya
represents the Highest Self as the personified deity, as the lord,
î*s*a, or Rudra, under the sway of his own creative power, prak*ri*ti or
mâyâ.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[244:2](sbe15102.htm#fr_751.md) *S*aṅkara explains
*g*âla, snare, by mâyâ. The verse must be corrected, according to
*S*aṅkara's commentary:

ya eko *g*âlavân î*s*ata î*s*anîbhi*h*  
sarvân̐ llokân î*s*ata î*s*anîbhi*h*.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[244:3](sbe15102.htm#fr_752.md) Sambhava, in the
sense of Vergehen, perishing, rests on no authority.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[244:4](sbe15102.htm#fr_753.md) Here again the
MSS. A. B. read *g*anâs, as a vocative.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[244:5](sbe15102.htm#fr_754.md) I prefer
sa*mk*uko*k*a to sa*mk*ukopa, which gives us the meaning that Rudra,
after having created all things, draws together, i.e. takes them all
back into himself, at the end of time. I have translated sa*msrig*ya by
having created, because Boehtlingk and Roth give other instances of
sa*msrig* with that sense. Otherwise, 'having mixed them together
again,' would seem more appropriate. A. and B. read sa*mk*uko*k*a.

<span id="fn_753"></span>[244:6](sbe15102.htm#fr_755.md) This is a very
popular verse, and occurs *Ri*g-veda X, 81, 3; Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XVII, 19;
Ath.-veda XIII, 2, 26; Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 6, 2, 4; Taitt. Âr. X, 1, 3.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[244:7](sbe15102.htm#fr_756.md) *S*aṅkara takes
dhamati in the sense of sa*m*yogayati, i.e. he joins men with arms,
birds with wings.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[245:1](sbe15102.htm#fr_757.md) See IV, 12.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[245:2](sbe15102.htm#fr_758.md) See Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h.
XVI, 2; Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 5, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[245:3](sbe15102.htm#fr_759.md) See Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h.
XVI, 3; Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 5, 1, 1; Nîlarudropan. p. 274.

<span id="fn_758"></span>[245:4](sbe15102.htm#fr_760.md) The knowledge
consists in knowing either that Brahman is Î*s*a or that Î*s*a is
Brahman. But in either case the gender of the adjectives is difficult.
The *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad seems to use b*ri*hanta as an adjective,
instead of b*ri*hat. I should prefer to translate: Beyond this is the
High Brahman, the vast. Those who know Î*s*a, the Lord, hidden in all
things and embracing all things to be this (Brahman), become immortal.
See also Muir, Metrical Translations, p. 196, whose translation of these
verses I have adopted with few exceptions.

<span id="fn_759"></span>[245:5](sbe15102.htm#fr_761.md) Cf. Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h.
XXX, 18; Taitt. Âr. III, 12, 3,

<span id="fn_760"></span>[245:6](sbe15102.htm#fr_762.md) Cf. Bhagavadgîtâ
VIII, 9.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[245:7](sbe15102.htm#fr_763.md) Cf. *S*vet. Up.
VI, 15.

<span id="fn_762"></span>[246:1](sbe15102.htm#fr_764.md) Divi, the sky, is
explained by *S*aṅkara as dyotanâtmani svamahimni.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[246:2](sbe15102.htm#fr_765.md) The pain of
sa*m*sâra, or transmigration. See B*ri*had. Up. IV, 3, 20 (p. 178).

<span id="fn_764"></span>[246:3](sbe15102.htm#fr_766.md) I feel doubtful
whether the two names Bhagavat and *S*iva should here be preserved, or
whether the former should be rendered by holy, the latter by happy. The
commentator explains Bhagavat by

ai*s*varyasya samagrasya vîryasya ya*s*asa*h* *s*riya*h*  
*Gñ*ânavairâgyayo*s* *k*aiva sha*nn*âm bhaga itira*n*â.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Wilson, in his
Essay on the Religious Sects of the Hindus, published in 1828, in the
Asiatic Researches, XVI, p. 11, pointed out that this verse and another
(*S*vet. Up. II, 2) were cited by the *S*aivas as Vedic authorities for
their teaching. He remarked that these citations would scarcely have
been made, if not authentic, and that they probably did occur in the
Vedas. In the new edition of this Essay by Dr. Rost, 1862, the
references should have been added.

<span id="fn_765"></span>[246:4](sbe15102.htm#fr_767.md) *S*aṅkara explains
sattvasya by anta*h*kara*n*asya.

<span id="fn_766"></span>[246:5](sbe15102.htm#fr_768.md) I take prâpti,
like other terms occurring in this Upanishad, in its technical sense.
Prâpti is one of the vibhûtis or ai*s*varyas, viz. the power of touching
anything at will, as touching the moon with the tip of one's finger. See
Yoga-sûtras, ed. Rajendralal Mitra, p. 121.

<span id="fn_767"></span>[246:6](sbe15102.htm#fr_769.md) Cf. Taitt. Âr. X,
71 (Anuv. 38, p. 858). Ka*th*. Up. IV, 12-13; above, p. 16.

<span id="fn_768"></span>[247:1](sbe15102.htm#fr_770.md) The text has
manvî*s*a, which *S*aṅkara explains by *gñ*âne*s*a. But Weber has
conjectured rightly, I believe, that the original text must have been
manîshâ. The difficulty is to understand how so common a word as manîshâ
could have been changed into so unusual a word as manvî*s*a. See IV, 20.

<span id="fn_769"></span>[247:2](sbe15102.htm#fr_771.md) This is a famous
verse of the *Ri*g-veda, X, 90, 1; repeated in the Atharva-veda, XIX, 6,
1; Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXXI, 1; Taitt. Âr. III, 12, 1. *S*aṅkara explains ten
fingers' breadth by endless; or, he says, it may be meant for the heart,
which is ten fingers above the navel.

<span id="fn_770"></span>[247:3](sbe15102.htm#fr_772.md) Sâya*n*a, in his
commentary on the Rig-veda and the Taitt. Âr., gives another
explanation, viz. he is also the lord of all the immortals, i.e. the
gods, because they grow to their exceeding state by means of food, or
for the sake of food.

<span id="fn_771"></span>[247:4](sbe15102.htm#fr_773.md) The gender changes
frequently, according as the author thinks either of the Brahman, or of
its impersonation as Î*s*a, Lord.

<span id="fn_772"></span>[247:5](sbe15102.htm#fr_774.md) *S*aṅkara explains
loka by nikâya, body.

<span id="fn_773"></span>[247:6](sbe15102.htm#fr_775.md) Cf. Ka*th*. Up. V,
1.

<span id="fn_774"></span>[248:1](sbe15102.htm#fr_776.md) Cf. Taitt. Âr. X,
12 (10), p. 800; Ka*th*. Up. II, 20; above, p. 11. The translation had
to be slightly altered, because the *S*vetâ*s*vataras, as Taittirîyas,
read akratum for akratu*h*, and î*s*am for âtmana*h*.

<span id="fn_775"></span>[248:2](sbe15102.htm#fr_777.md) Cf. Taitt. Âr.
III, 13, 1; III, 12, 7.

<span id="fn_776"></span>[248:3](sbe15102.htm#fr_778.md) A. reads
vedârû*dh*am, not B.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[248:4](sbe15102.htm#fr_779.md) A. and B. read
brahmavâdino hi pravadanti.
