### SIXTH QUESTION.

1\. Then Suke*s*as Bhâradvâga asked him, saying: 'Sir, Hira*n*yanâbha,
the prince of Kosalâ <span id="fr_921"></span>[2](#fn_918.md), came to me
and asked this question: Do you know the person of sixteen parts, O
Bhâradvâga? I said to the prince: I do not know him; if I knew him, how
should I not tell you? Surely, he who speaks what is untrue withers away
to the very root; therefore I will not say what is untrue. Then he
mounted his chariot and went away silently. Now I ask you, where is that
person?'

2\. He replied: 'Friend, that person is here within the body, he in whom
these sixteen parts arise.

3\. He reflected: What is it by whose departure I shall depart, and by
whose staying I shall stay?

4\. He sent forth (created) Prâ*n*a (spirit) <span
id="fr_922"></span>[3](#fn_919.md); from

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Prâ*n*a *S*raddhâ
(faith) <span id="fr_923"></span>[1](#fn_920.md), ether, air, light, water,
earth, sense, mind, food; from food came vigour, penance, hymns,
sacrifice, the worlds, and in the worlds the name <span
id="fr_924"></span>[2](#fn_921.md) also.

5\. As these flowing rivers <span id="fr_925"></span>[3](#fn_922.md) that
go towards the ocean, when they have reached the ocean, sink into it,
their name and form are broken, and people speak of the ocean only,
exactly thus these sixteen parts of the spectator that go towards the
person (purusha), when they have reached the person, sink into him,
their name and form are broken, and people speak of the person only, and
he becomes without parts and immortal. On this there is this verse:

6\. That person who is to be known, he in whom these parts rest, like
spokes in the nave of a wheel, you know him, lest death should hurt
you.'

7\. Then he (Pippalâda) said to them: 'So far do I know this Highest
Brahman, there is nothing higher than it.'

8\. And they praising him, said: 'You, indeed, are our father, you who
carry us from our ignorance to the other shore.'

Adoration to the highest *Ri*shis!

Adoration to the highest *Ri*shis!

Tat sat. Hari*h*, Om!
