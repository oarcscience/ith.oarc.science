<p>1. Then Bh&acirc;rgava Vaidarbhi asked him: 'Sir, How many gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_881"></A><A HREF="#fn_879"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> keep what has thus been created, how many manifest this&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_882"></A><A HREF="#fn_880"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and who is the best of them?'</p>  
<p>2. He replied: 'The ether is that god, the wind, fire, water, earth, speech, mind, eye, and ear. These, when they have manifested (their power), contend and say: We (each of us) support this body and keep it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_883"></A><A HREF="#fn_881"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>3&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_884"></A><A HREF="#fn_882"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Then Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a (breath, spirit, life), as the best, said to them: Be not deceived, I alone, dividing myself fivefold, support this body and keep it.</p>  
<p>4. They were incredulous; so he, from pride, did as if he were going out from above. Thereupon,</p>

<p>as he went out, all the others went out, and as he returned, all the others returned. As bees go out when their queen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_885"></A><A HREF="#fn_883"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> goes out, and return when she returns, thus (did) speech, mind, eye, and ear; and, being satisfied, they praise Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, saying:</p>  
<p>5. He is Agni (fire), he shines as S&ucirc;rya (sun), he is Par<I>g</I>anya (rain), the powerful (Indra), he is V&acirc;yu, (wind), he is the earth, he is matter, he is God--he is what is and what is not, and what is immortal.</p>  
<p>6. As spokes in the nave of a wheel, everything is fixed in Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, the verses of the <I>Ri</I>g-veda, Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, S&acirc;ma-veda, the sacrifice, the Kshatriyas, and the Br&acirc;hmans.</p>  
<p>7. As Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (lord of creatures) thou movest about in the womb, thou indeed art born again. To thee, the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, these creatures bring offerings, to thee who dwellest with the other pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as (the organs of sense).</p>  
<p>8. Thou art the best carrier for the Gods, thou art the first offering&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_886"></A><A HREF="#fn_884"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> to the Fathers. Thou art the true work of the Rishis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_887"></A><A HREF="#fn_885"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, of the Atharv&acirc;&#7749;giras.</p>  
<p>9. O Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, thou art Indra by thy light, thou art Rudra, as a protector; thou movest in the sky, thou art the sun, the lord of lights.</p>  
<p>10. When thou showerest down rain, then, O Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, these creatures of thine are delighted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_888"></A><A HREF="#fn_886"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, hoping that there will be food, as much as they desire.</p>

<p>11. Thou art a Vr&acirc;tya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_889"></A><A HREF="#fn_887"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, O Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, the only <I>Ri</I>shi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_890"></A><A HREF="#fn_888"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the consumer of everything, the good lord. We are the givers of what thou hast to consume, thou, O M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>va&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_891"></A><A HREF="#fn_889"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, art our father.</p>  
<p>12. Make propitious that body of thine which dwells in speech, in the ear, in the eye, and which pervades the mind; do not go away!</p>  
<p>13. All this is in the power of Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, whatever exists in the three heavens. Protect us like a mother her sons, and give us happiness and wisdom.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_879"></A><A HREF="sbe15107.htm#fr_881">274:1</A> Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>, powers, organs, senses.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_880"></A><A HREF="sbe15107.htm#fr_882">274:2</A> Their respective power.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_881"></A><A HREF="sbe15107.htm#fr_883">274:3</A> This is <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara's explanation, in which b&acirc;<I>n</I>a is taken to mean the same as <I>s</I>ar&icirc;ra, body. But there seems to be no authority for such a meaning, and &Acirc;nandagiri tries in vain to find an etymological excuse for it. B&acirc;<I>n</I>a or V&acirc;<I>n</I>a generally means an arrow, or, particularly in Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a writings, a harp with many strings. I do not see how an arrow could be used as an appropriate simile here, but a harp might, if we take avash<I>t</I>abhya in the sense of holding the frame of the instrument, and vidh&acirc;ray&acirc;ma<I>h</I> in the sense of stretching and thereby modulating it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_882"></A><A HREF="sbe15107.htm#fr_884">274:4</A> On this dispute of the organs of sense, see B<I>ri</I>h. Up. VI, 1, p. 201; <I>Kh</I>&acirc;nd. Up. V, 1 (S. B. E., vol. i, p. 72).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_883"></A><A HREF="sbe15107.htm#fr_885">275:1</A> In Sanskrit it is madhukarar&acirc;<I>g</I>a, king of the bees.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_884"></A><A HREF="sbe15107.htm#fr_886">275:2</A> When a <I>s</I>r&acirc;ddha is offered to the Pit<I>ri</I>s.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_885"></A><A HREF="sbe15107.htm#fr_887">275:3</A> Explained as the eye and the other organs of sense which the chief Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a supports; but it is probably an old verse, here applied to a special purpose.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_886"></A><A HREF="sbe15107.htm#fr_888">275:4</A> Another reading is pr&acirc;<I>n</I>ate, they breathe.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_887"></A><A HREF="sbe15107.htm#fr_889">276:1</A> A person for whom the sa<I>m</I>sk&acirc;ras, the sacramental and initiatory rites, have not been performed. <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara says that, as he was the first born, there was no one to perform them for him, and that he is called Vr&acirc;tya, because he was pure by nature. This is all very doubtful.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_888"></A><A HREF="sbe15107.htm#fr_890">276:2</A> Agni is said to be the <I>Ri</I>shi of the &Acirc;tharva<I>n</I>as.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_889"></A><A HREF="sbe15107.htm#fr_891">276:3</A> Instead of the irregular vocative M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>va, there is another reading, M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>vana<I>h</I>, i.e. thou art the father of M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van, the wind, and therefore of the whole world.</P>
