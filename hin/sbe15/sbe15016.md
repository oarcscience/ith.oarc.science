# MU*ND*AKA-UPANISHAD.

## FIRST MU*ND*AKA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. BRAHMA was the first of the Devas, the maker of the universe, the
preserver of the world. He told the knowledge of Brahman, the foundation
of all knowledge, to his eldest son Atharva <span
id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_154.md).

2\. Whatever Brahmâ told Atharvan, that knowledge of Brahman Atharvan
formerly told to Aṅgir; he told it to Satyavâha Bhâradvâ*g*a, and
Bhâradvâ*g*a told it in succession to Aṅgiras.

3\. *S*aunaka, the great householder, approached Aṅgiras respectfully
and asked: 'Sir, what is that through which, if it is known, everything
else becomes known?'

4\. He said to him: 'Two kinds of knowledge must be known, this is what
all who know Brahman tell us, the higher and the lower knowledge.'

5\. 9 The lower knowledge is the *Ri*g-veda, Ya*g*ur-veda, Sâma-veda,
Atharva-veda, *S*ikshâ (phonetics), Kalpa (ceremonial), Vyâkara*n*a
(grammar), Nirukta (etymology), *Kh*andas (metre), *G*yotisha
(astronomy) <span id="fr_155"></span>[2](#fn_155.md);

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

but the higher knowledge is that by which the Indestructible (Brahman)
is apprehended.'

6\. 'That which cannot be seen, nor seized, which has no family and no
caste <span id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_156.md), no eyes nor ears, no hands
nor feet, the eternal, the omnipresent (all-pervading), infinitesimal,
that which is imperishable, that it is which the wise regard as the
source of all beings.'

7\. 'As the spider sends forth and draws in its thread, as plants grow
on the earth, as from every man hairs spring forth on the head and the
body, thus does everything arise here from the Indestructible.'

8\. 'The Brahman swells by means of brooding (penance) <span
id="fr_157"></span>[2](#fn_157); hence is produced matter (food.md); from
matter breath <span id="fr_158"></span>[3](#fn_158.md), mind, the
true <span id="fr_159"></span>[4](#fn_159), the worlds (seven.md), and from
the works (performed by men in the worlds), the immortal (the eternal
effects, rewards, and punishments of works).'

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

9\. 'From him who perceives all and who knows all, whose brooding
(penance) consists of knowledge, from him (the highest Brahman) is born
that Brahman <span id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_160.md), name, form <span
id="fr_161"></span>[2](#fn_161), and matter (food.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_154"></span>[27:1](sbe15016.htm#fr_154.md) The change between
Atharva and Atharvan, like that between Na*k*iketas and Nâ*k*iketa,
shows the freedom of the phraseology of the Upanishad, and cannot be
used for fixing the date of the constituent elements of the Upanishad.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[27:2](sbe15016.htm#fr_155.md) Other MSS. add here
itihâsa-purâ*n*a-nyâya-mîmâ*m*sâ-dharma-*s*âstrâ*n*i.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[28:1](sbe15016.htm#fr_156.md) I translate var*n*a
by caste on account of its conjunction with gotra. The commentator
translates, 'without origin and without qualities.' We should say that
which belongs to no genus or species.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[28:2](sbe15016.htm#fr_157.md) I have translated
tapas by brooding, because this is the only word in English which
combines the two meanings of warmth and thought. Native authorities
actually admit two roots, one tap, to burn, the other tap, to meditate;
see commentary on Parâ*s*ara-sm*ri*ti, p. 39<sup>b</sup> (MS. Bodl.),
Tapa*h* kri*kkh*ra*k*andrâya*n*âdirûpe*n*âhâravar*g*anam. Nanu Vyâsena

<span id="fn_159"></span>[28:4](sbe15016.htm#fr_159.md) Satya, if we
compare Ka*th*. VI, 7 and III, 10, seems to mean buddhi. Here it is
explained by the five elements.

frequent concept in Buddhistic literature.
