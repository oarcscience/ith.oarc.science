### FIFTH BRÂHMANA <span id="fr_539"></span>[2](#fn_539.md).

1\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya had two wives, Maitreyî and Kâtyâyanî. Of these
Maitreyî was conversant with Brahman, but Kâtyâyanî possessed such
knowledge only as women possess. And Yâ*gñ*avalkya, when he wished to
get ready for another state of life (when he wished to give up the state
of a householder, and retire into the forest),

2\. Said, 'Maitreyî, verily I am going away from this my house (into the
forest). Forsooth, let me make a settlement between thee and that
Kâtyâyanî.'

3\. Maitreyî said: 'My Lord, if this whole earth, full of wealth,
belonged to me, tell me, should I be immortal by it, or no?'

'No,' replied Yâ*gñ*avalkya, 'like the life of rich people will be thy
life. But there is no hope of immortality by wealth.'

4\. And Maitreyî said: 'What should I do with that by which I do not
become immortal? What my Lord knoweth <span
id="fr_540"></span>[3](#fn_540) (of immortality.md), tell that clearly to
me.'

5\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'Thou who art truly dear to me, thou hast
increased what is dear (to me in

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

thee) <span id="fr_541"></span>[1](#fn_541.md). Therefore, if you like,
Lady, I will explain it to thee, and mark well what I say.'

6\. And he said: 'Verily, a husband is not dear, that you may love the
husband; but that you may love the Self, therefore a husband is dear.

'Verily, a wife is not dear, that you may love the wife; but that you
may love the Self, therefore a wife is dear.

'Verily, sons are not dear, that you may love the sons; but that you may
love the Self, therefore sons are dear.

'Verily, wealth is not dear, that you may love wealth; but that you may
love the Self, therefore wealth is dear.

'Verily, cattle <span id="fr_542"></span>[2](#fn_542.md) are not dear, that
you may love cattle; but that you may love the Self, therefore cattle
are dear.

'Verily, the Brahman-class is not dear, that you may love the
Brahman-class; but that you may love the Self, therefore the
Brahman-class is dear.

'Verily, the Kshatra-class is not dear, that you may love the
Kshatra-class; but that you may love the Self, therefore the
Kshatra-class is dear.

'Verily, the worlds are not dear, that you may love the worlds; but that
you may love the Self, therefore the worlds are dear.

'Verily, the Devas are not dear, that you may love the Devas; but that
you may love the Self, therefore the Devas are dear.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

'Verily, the Vedas are not dear, that you may love the Vedas; but that
you may love the Self, therefore the Vedas are dear.

'Verily, creatures are not dear, that you may love the creatures; but
that you may love the Self, therefore are creatures dear.

'Verily, everything is not dear, that you may love everything; but that
you may love the Self, therefore everything is dear.

'Verily, the Self is to be seen, to be heard, to be perceived, to be
marked, O Maitreyî! When the Self has been seen, heard, perceived, and
known, then all this is known!

7\. 'Whosoever looks for the Brahman-class elsewhere than in the Self,
was abandoned by the Brahman-class. Whosoever looks for the
Kshatra-class elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the
Kshatra-class. Whosoever looks for the worlds elsewhere than in the
Self, was abandoned by the worlds. Whosoever looks for the Devas
elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the Devas. Whosoever looks
for the Vedas elsewhere than in the Self, was abandoned by the Vedas.
Whosoever looks for the creatures elsewhere than in the Self, was
abandoned by the creatures. Whosoever looks for anything elsewhere than
in the Self, was abandoned by anything.

'This Brahman-class, this Kshatra-class, these worlds, these Devas,
these Vedas, all these beings, this everything, all is that Self.

8\. 'Now as the sounds of a drum, when beaten, cannot be seized
externally (by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the drum is
seized, or the beater of the drum;

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

9\. 'And as the sounds of a conch-shell, when blown, cannot be seized
externally (by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the shell is
seized, or the blower of the shell;

10\. 'And as the sounds of a lute, when played, cannot be seized
externally (by themselves), but the sound is seized, when the lute is
seized, or the player of the lute;

11\. 'As clouds of smoke proceed by themselves out of lighted fire
kindled with damp fuel, thus verily, O Maitreyî, has been breathed forth
from this great Being what we have as *Ri*g-veda, Ya*g*ur-veda,
Sâma-veda, Atharvâṅgirasas, Itihâsa, Purâ*n*a, Vidyâ, the Upanishads,
*S*lokas, Sûtras, Anuvyâkhyânas, Vyâkhyânas, what is sacrificed, what is
poured out, food, drink <span id="fr_543"></span>[1](#fn_543.md), this
world and the other world, and all creatures. From him alone all these
were breathed forth.

12\. 'As all waters find their centre in the sea, all touches in the
skin, all tastes in the tongue, all smells in the nose, all colours in
the eye, all sounds in the ear, all percepts in the mind, all- knowledge
in the heart, all actions in the hands, all movements in the feet, and
all the Vedas in speech,--

13\. 'As a mass of salt has neither inside nor outside, but is
altogether a mass of taste, thus indeed has that Self neither inside nor
outside, but is altogether a mass of knowledge; and having risen from
out these elements, vanishes again in them. When he has departed, there
is no more knowledge (name), I say, O Maitreyî,'--thus spoke
Yâ*gñ*avalkya.

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

14\. Then Maitreyî said: 'Here, Sir, thou hast landed me in utter
bewilderment. Indeed, I do not understand him.'

But he replied: 'O Maitreyî, I say nothing that is bewildering. Verily,
beloved, that Self is imperishable, and of an indestructible nature.

15\. 'For when there is as it were duality, then one sees the other, one
smells the other, one tastes the other, one salutes the other, one hears
the other, one perceives the other, one touches the other, one knows the
other; but when the Self only is all this, how should he see another,
how should he smell another, how should he taste another, how should he
salute another, how should he hear another, how should he touch another,
how should he know another? How should he know Him by whom he knows all
this? That Self is to be described by No, no <span
id="fr_544"></span>[1](sbe15078.htm#fn_544.md)! He is incomprehensible, for
he cannot be comprehended; he is imperishable, for he cannot perish; he
is unattached, for he does not attach himself; unfettered, he does not
suffer, he does not fail. How, O beloved, should he know the Knower?
Thus, O Maitreyî, thou hast been instructed. Thus far goes immortality.'
Having said so, Yâ*gñ*avalkya went away (into the forest).

has av*ri*dhat, which *S*aṅkara explains by vardhitavatî nirdhâritavaty
asi. The Mâdhyandinas read av*ri*tat, which the commentator explains by
avartayat, vartitavaty asi.
