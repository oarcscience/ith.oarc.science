### SIXTH ANUVÂKA.

'He who knows the Brahman as non-existing, becomes himself non-existing.
He who knows the Brahman as existing, him we know himself as existing.'
The embodied Self of this (bliss) is the same as that of the former
(understanding).

Thereupon follow the questions of the pupil:

'Does any one who knows not, after he has departed this life, ever go to
that world? Or does he who knows, after he has departed, go to that
world <span id="fr_218"></span>[1](#fn_218.md)?'

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

The answer is: He wished, may I be many <span
id="fr_219"></span>[1](sbe15040.htm#fn_219.md), may I grow forth. He
brooded over himself (like a man performing penance). After he had thus
brooded, he sent forth (created) all, whatever there is. Having sent
forth, he entered into it. Having entered it, he became sat (what is
manifest) and tyat (what is not manifest), defined and undefined,
supported and not supported, (endowed with) knowledge and without
knowledge (as stones), real and unreal <span
id="fr_220"></span>[2](sbe15040.htm#fn_220). The Sattya (true.md) became
all this whatsoever, and therefore the wise call it (the Brahman)
Sat-tya (the true).

On this there is also this *S*loka:

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_218"></span>[57:1](sbe15039.htm#fr_218.md) As he who knows and
he who knows not, are both sprung from Brahman, the question is supposed
to be asked by the pupil, whether both will equally attain Brahman.
