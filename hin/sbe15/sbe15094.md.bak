## SIXTH ADHYÂYA.

### FIRST BRÂHMANA <span id="fr_591"></span>[1](#fn_591.md).

1\. Hari*h*, Om. He who knows the first and the best, becomes himself
the first and the best among his people. Breath is indeed the first and
the best. He who knows this, becomes the first and the best among his
people, and among whomsoever he wishes to be so.

2\. He who knows the richest <span id="fr_592"></span>[2](#fn_592.md),
becomes himself the richest among his people. Speech is the richest. He
who knows this, becomes the richest among his people, and among
whomsoever he wishes to be so.

3\. He who knows the firm rest, becomes himself firm on even and uneven
ground. The eye indeed is the firm rest, for by means of the eye a man
stands firm on even and uneven ground. He who knows this, stands firm on
even and uneven ground.

4\. He who knows success, whatever desire he desires, it succeeds to
him. The ear indeed is success. For in the ear are all these Vedas
successful. He who knows this, whatever desire he desires, it succeeds
to him.

5\. He who knows the home, becomes a home of his own people, a home of
all men. The mind

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

indeed is the home. He who knows this, becomes a home of his own people
and a home of all men.

6\. He who knows generation <span id="fr_593"></span>[1](#fn_593.md),
becomes rich in offspring and cattle. Seed indeed is generation. He who
knows this, becomes rich in offspring and cattle.

7\. These Prâ*n*as (senses), when quarrelling together as to who was the
best, went to Brahman <span id="fr_594"></span>[2](#fn_594.md) and said:
'Who is the richest of us?' He replied: 'He by whose departure this body
seems worst, he is the richest.'

8\. The tongue (speech) departed, and having been absent for a year, it
came back and said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They
replied: 'Like unto people, not speaking with the tongue, but breathing
with breath, seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear, knowing with the
mind, generating with seed. Thus we have lived.' Then speech entered in.

9\. The eye (sight) departed, and having been absent for a year, it came
back and said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They
replied: 'Like blind people, not seeing with the eye, but breathing with
the breath, speaking with the tongue, hearing with the ear, knowing with
the mind, generating with seed. Thus we have lived.' Then the eye
entered in.

10\. The ear (hearing) departed, and having been absent for a year, it
came back and said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They
replied: 'Like deaf people, not hearing with the ear,

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_591"></span>[201:1](sbe15094.htm#fr_591.md) This Brâhma*n*a,
also called a Khila (p. 1010, l. 8; p. 1029, l. 8), occurs in the
Mâdhyandina-*s*âkhâ XIV, 9, 2. It should be compared with the
*Kh*ândogya-upanishad V, 1 (Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. 72);
also with the Ait. Âr. II, 4; Kaush. Up. III, 3; and the Pra*sñ*a Up.
II, 3.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[201:2](sbe15094.htm#fr_592.md) Here used as a
feminine, while in the *Kh*ând. Up. V, 1, it is vasish*th*a.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[202:1](sbe15094.htm#fr_593.md) This is wanting in
the *Kh*ând. Up. Roer and Poley read Pra*g*âpati for pra*g*âti. MS, I.
O. 3 75 has pra*g*âti, MS. I. O. 1973 pra*g*âpati.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[202:2](sbe15094.htm#fr_594.md) Here we have
Pra*g*âpati, instead of Brahman, in the *Kh*ând. Up.; also sresh*th*a
instead of vasish*th*a.

but breathing with the breath, speaking with the tongue, seeing with the
eye, knowing with the mind, generating with seed. Thus we have lived.'
Then the ear entered in.

11\. The mind departed, and having been absent for a year, it came back
and said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They replied:
'Like fools, not knowing with their mind, but breathing with the breath,
seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear, generating with seed. Thus we
have lived.' Then the mind entered in.

12\. The seed departed, and having been absent for a year, it came back
and said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They replied:
'Like impotent people, not generating with seed, but breathing with the
breath, seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear, knowing with the
mind. Thus we have lived.' Then the seed entered in.

13\. The (vital) breath, when on the point of departing, tore up these
senses, as a great, excellent horse of the Sindhu country might tare up
the pegs to which he is tethered. They said to him: 'Sir, do not depart.
We shall not be able to live without thee.' He said: 'Then make me an
offering.' They said: 'Let it be so.'

14\. Then the tongue said: 'If I am the richest, then thou art the
richest by it.' The eye said: 'If I am the firm rest, then thou art
possessed of firm rest by it.' The ear said: 'If I am success, then thou
art possessed of success by it.' The mind said: 'If I am the home, thou
art the home by it.' The seed said: 'If I am generation, thou art
possessed of generation by it.' He said: 'What shall be food, what shall
be dress for me?'

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

They replied: 'Whatever there is, even unto dogs, worms, insects, and
birds <span id="fr_595"></span>[1](#fn_595.md), that is thy food, and water
thy dress. He who thus knows the food of Ana (the breath) <span
id="fr_596"></span>[2](#fn_596.md), by him nothing is eaten that is not
(proper) food, nothing is received that is not (proper) food.
*S*rotriyas (Vedic theologians) who know this, rinse the mouth with
water when they are going to eat, and rinse the mouth with water after
they have eaten, thinking that thereby they make the breath dressed
(with water).'

<span id="fn_595"></span>[204:1](sbe15094.htm#fr_595.md) It may mean, every
kind of food, such as is eaten by dogs, worms, insects, and birds.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[204:2](sbe15094.htm#fr_596.md) We must read, with
MS. I. O. 375, anasyânnam, not annasyânnam, as MS. I. O. 1973, Roer, and
Poley read. Weber has the right reading, which is clearly suggested by
*Kh*ând. Up. V, 2, 1.
