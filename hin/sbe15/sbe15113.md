### SECOND PRAPÂTHAKA.

1\. Then the Saint *S*âkâyanya, well pleased, said to the King: 'Great
King B*ri*hadratha, thou banner of the race of Ikshvâku, quickly
obtaining a knowledge of Self, thou art happy, and art renowned by the
name of Marut, the wind <span id="fr_944"></span>[1](#fn_941). This
indeed is thy Self <span id="fr_945"></span>[2](#fn_942).'

'Which <span id="fr_946"></span>[3](#fn_943), O Saint,' said the King.

Then the Saint said to him:

2\. 'He <span id="fr_947"></span>[4](#fn_944) who, without stopping the
out-breathing <span id="fr_948"></span>[5](#fn_945), proceeds upwards
(from the sthûla to the sûkshma *s*arîra), and who, modified (by
impressions), and yet not modified <span
id="fr_949"></span>[6](#fn_946), drives away the darkness (of error), he
is the Self. Thus said the Saint Maitri <span
id="fr_950"></span>[7](#fn_947).' And *S*âkâyanya said to the King
B*ri*hadratha: 'He who in perfect rest, rising from this body (both from
the sthûla and sûkshma), and reaching the highest

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

light <span id="fr_951"></span>[1](#fn_948), comes forth in his own
form, he is the Self <span id="fr_952"></span>[2](#fn_949) (thus said
*S*âkâyanya); this is the immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman.'

3\. 'Now then this is the science of Brahman, and the science of all
Upanishads, O King, which was told us by the Saint Maitri <span
id="fr_953"></span>[3](#fn_950). I shall tell it to thee:

'We hear (in the sacred records) that there were once the
Vâlakhilyas <span id="fr_954"></span>[4](#fn_951), who had left off all
evil, who were vigorous and passionless. They said to the Pra*g*âpati
Kratu: "O Saint, this body is without intelligence, like a cart. To what
supernatural being belongs this great power by which such a body has
been made intelligent? Or who is the driver? What thou knowest, O Saint,
tell us that <span id="fr_955"></span>[5](#fn_952)."' Pra*g*âpati
answered and said:

4\. 'He who in the Sruti is called "Standing above," like passionless
ascetics <span id="fr_956"></span>[6](#fn_953) amidst the objects of the
world, he, indeed, the pure, clean, undeveloped, tranquil, breathless,
bodiless <span id="fr_957"></span>[7](#fn_954), endless, imperishable,
firm, everlasting, unborn, independent one, stands in his own greatness,
and by him has this body been made intelligent, and he is also the
driver of it.'

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

They said: 'O Saint, How has this been made intelligent by such a being
as this which has no desires <span id="fr_958"></span>[1](#fn_955), and
how is he its driver?' He answered them and said:

5\. 'That Self which is very small, invisible, incomprehensible, called
Purusha, dwells of his own will here in part <span
id="fr_959"></span>[2](#fn_956); just as a man who is fast asleep awakes
of his own will <span id="fr_960"></span>[3](#fn_957). And this part (of
the Self) which is entirely intelligent, reflected in man (as the sun in
different vessels of water), knowing the body (kshetra*gñ*a), attested
by his conceiving, willing, and believing <span
id="fr_961"></span>[4](#fn_958), is Pra*g*âpati (lord of creatures),
called Vi*s*va. By him, the intelligent, is this body made intelligent,
and he is the driver thereof.'

They said to him: 'O Saint <span id="fr_962"></span>[5](#fn_959), if
this has been made intelligent by such a being as this, which has no
desires, and if he is the driver thereof, how was it?' He answered them
and said:

6\. 'In the beginning Pra*g*âpati (the lord of creatures) stood alone.
He had no happiness, when alone. Meditating <span
id="fr_963"></span>[6](#fn_960) on himself, he created many

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

creatures. He looked on them and saw they were, like a stone, without
understanding, and standing like a lifeless post. He had no happiness.
He thought, I shall enter <span id="fr_964"></span>[1](#fn_961) within,
that they may awake. Making himself like air (vâyu) <span
id="fr_965"></span>[2](#fn_962) he entered within. Being one, he could
not do it. Then dividing himself fivefold, he is called Prâ*n*a, Apâna,
Samâna, Udâna, Vyâna. Now that <span id="fr_966"></span>[3](#fn_963) air
which rises upwards, is Prâ*n*a. That which moves downwards, is Apâna.
That by which these two are supposed to be held, is Vyâna. That <span
id="fr_967"></span>[4](#fn_964) which carries the grosser material of
food to the Apâna, and brings the subtler material to each limb, has the
name Samâna. \[After these (Prâ*n*a, Apâna, Samâna) comes the work of
the Vyâna, and between them (the Prâ*n*a, Apâna, and Samâna on one side
and the Vyâna on the other) comes the rising of the Udâna.\] That which
brings up or carries down <span id="fr_968"></span>[5](#fn_965) what has
been drunk and eaten, is the Udâna <span
id="fr_969"></span>[6](#fn_966).

Now the Upâ*m*su-vessel (or prâ*n*a) depends on the Antaryâma-vessel
(apâna) and the Antaryâma-vessel

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (apâna) on the
Upâ*m*su-vessel <span id="fr_970"></span>[1](#fn_967) (prâ*n*a), and
between these two the self-resplendent (Self) produced heat <span
id="fr_971"></span>[2](#fn_968). This heat is the purusha (person), and
this purusha is Agni Vai*s*vânara. And thus it is said elsewhere <span
id="fr_972"></span>[3](#fn_969): "Agni Vai*s*vânara is the fire within
man by which the food that is eaten is cooked, i.e. digested. Its noise
is that which one hears, if one covers one's ears. When a man is on the
point of departing this life, he does not hear that noise."

Now he <span id="fr_973"></span>[4](#fn_970), having divided himself
fivefold, is hidden in a secret place (buddhi), assuming the nature of
mind, having the prâ*n*as as his body, resplendent, having true
concepts, and free like ether <span id="fr_974"></span>[5](#fn_971).
Feeling even thus that he has not attained his object, he thinks from
within the interior of the heart <span id="fr_975"></span>[6](#fn_972),
"Let me enjoy objects." Therefore, having first broken open these five
apertures (of the senses), he enjoys the objects by means of the five
reins. This means that these perceptive organs (ear, skin, eye, tongue,
nose) are his reins; the active organs (tongue (for speaking), hands,
feet, anus, generative organ) his horses; the body his chariot, the mind
the charioteer, the whip being the temperament. Driven by that whip,
this body goes round like the

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

wheel driven by the potter. This body is made intelligent, and he is the
driver thereof.

This <span id="fr_976"></span>[1](#fn_973) is indeed the Self, who
seeming to be filled with desires, and seeming to be overcome <span
id="fr_977"></span>[2](#fn_974) by bright or dark fruits of action,
wanders about in every body (himself remaining free). Because he is not
manifest, because he is infinitely small, because he is invisible,
because he cannot be grasped, because he is attached to nothing,
therefore he, seeming to be changing, an agent in that which is not
(prak*ri*ti), is in reality not an agent and unchanging. He is pure,
firm, stable, undefiled <span id="fr_978"></span>[3](#fn_975), unmoved,
free from desire, remaining a spectator, resting in himself Having
concealed himself in the cloak of the three qualities he appears as the
enjoyer of *ri*ta, as the enjoyer of *ri*ta (of his good works).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_941"></span>[290:1](sbe15113.htm#fr_944) P*ri*shada*s*va in
the Veda is another name of the Maruts, the storm gods. Afterwards the
king is called Marut, VI, 30.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[290:2](sbe15113.htm#fr_945) This sentence is
called a Sûtra by the commentator to VI, 32.

<span id="fn_943"></span>[290:3](sbe15113.htm#fr_946) M. reads Kathaya
me katamo bhavân iti.

<span id="fn_944"></span>[290:4](sbe15113.htm#fr_947) M. leaves out
atha.

<span id="fn_945"></span>[290:5](sbe15113.htm#fr_948) One might read
âvish*t*ambhanena, in the sense of while preventing the departure of the
vital breath, as in the B*ri*h. Âr. VI, 3, prâ*n*ena rakshann avaram
kulâyam.

<span id="fn_946"></span>[290:6](sbe15113.htm#fr_949) M. reads
vyathamâno 'vyathamânas.

<span id="fn_947"></span>[290:7](sbe15113.htm#fr_950) M. leaves out
Maitri*h*-ity eva*m* hyâha. The commentator explains Maitrir by mitrâyâ
apatyam *ri*shir maitrir maitreya. In a later passage (II, 3) M. reads
Bhagavatâ Maitre*n*a, likewise the Anubhûtiprakâ*s*a.

<span id="fn_948"></span>[291:1](sbe15113.htm#fr_951) M. adds svaya*m*
gyotir upasampadya.

<span id="fn_949"></span>[291:2](sbe15113.htm#fr_952) M. reads esha for
ity esha, which seems better.

<span id="fn_950"></span>[291:3](sbe15113.htm#fr_953) M. reads
Maitre*n*a vyâkhyâtâ.

<span id="fn_951"></span>[291:4](sbe15113.htm#fr_954) M. M., Translation
of Rig-veda, Preface, p. xxxiv.

<span id="fn_952"></span>[291:5](sbe15113.htm#fr_955) M. adds: brûhîti
te ho*k*ur Bhagavan katham anena vâsya*m* yat Bhagavan vetsy etad
asmâka*m* brûhîti tân hovâ*k*eti.

<span id="fn_953"></span>[291:6](sbe15113.htm#fr_956) The commentator
allows ûtrdhvaretasasa*h* to be taken as a vocative also.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[291:7](sbe15113.htm#fr_957) Nirâtmâ is
explained by the commentator as thoughtless, without volition, &c. But
âtmâ is frequently used for body also, and this seems more appropriate
here. M., however, reads anî*s*âtmâ, and this is the reading explained
in the Anubhûtiprakâ*s*a, p. 228, ver. 60. This might mean the Âtman
which has not yet assumed the quality of a personal god. See VI, 28; VI,
31.

<span id="fn_955"></span>[292:1](sbe15113.htm#fr_958) The reading
anish*th*ena is explained by the commentator as free from any local
habitation or attachment. He also mentions the various readings
anish*t*ena, free from wishes, and anish*th*ena, the smallest. M. reads
ani*kkh*ena, and this seems better than anish*t*ena. The
Anubhûtiprakâ*s*a reads likewise ani*kkh*asya.

<span id="fn_956"></span>[292:2](sbe15113.htm#fr_959) I read
buddhipûrvam, and again with M. suptasyeva buddhipûrvam. I also read
a*m*sena without iti, as in M. The simile seems to be that a man, if he
likes, can wake himself at any time of night, and this 'if he likes' is
expressed by buddhipûrvam. See Anubhûtiprakâ*s*a, vv. 67, 68.

<span id="fn_957"></span>[292:3](sbe15113.htm#fr_960) M. reads
vibodhayati, atha.

<span id="fn_958"></span>[292:4](sbe15113.htm#fr_961) See Maitr. Up. V,
2; Cowell's Translation, pp. 246, 256; Vedântaparibhâshâ, ed. A. Venis,
in the Pandit, IV, p. 100.

<span id="fn_959"></span>[292:5](sbe15113.htm#fr_962) M. adds: bhagavann
îd*ris*asya katham a*ms*ena vartanam iti tân hovâ*k*a.

<span id="fn_960"></span>[292:6](sbe15113.htm#fr_963) AT. reads
abhidhyâyan.

<span id="fn_961"></span>[293:1](sbe15113.htm#fr_964) It is better to
read with M. vi*s*ânîti.

<span id="fn_962"></span>[293:2](sbe15113.htm#fr_965) M. vâyum iva.

<span id="fn_963"></span>[293:3](sbe15113.htm#fr_966) M. Atha yo 'yam.

<span id="fn_964"></span>[293:4](sbe15113.htm#fr_967) M. reads: yo
'ya*m* sthavish*th*am anna*m* dhâtum annasyâpâne sthâpayaty
a*n*ish*th*a*m* *k*âṅge 'ṅge sa*m*nayati esha vâva sa samâno 'tha yo
'yam. Leaving, out annam, this seems the right reading. The whole
sentence from uttaram to udânasya is left out in M.

<span id="fn_965"></span>[293:5](sbe15113.htm#fr_968) M. nigirati
*k*aisho vâva sa udâno 'tha yenaitâs sirâ anuvyâptâ esha vâva sa
vyâna*h*.

<span id="fn_966"></span>[293:6](sbe15113.htm#fr_969) The views of these
five kinds of wind differ considerably. Here the commentator explains
that the prâ*n*a and apâna, the up-breathing and down-breathing, keep
the bodily warmth alive, as bellows keep up a fire. The food cooked in
it is distributed by the Samâna, so that the coarse material becomes
ordure, the middle flesh, the subtle material mind (manas). The udâna
brings up phlegm, &c., while the Vyâna gives strength to the whole body.

<span id="fn_967"></span>[294:1](sbe15113.htm#fr_970) Two sacrificial
vessels (graha) placed on either side of the stone on which the Soma is
squeezed, and here compared to the Prâ*n*a and Apâna, between which the
Self (*k*aitanyâtmâ) assumes heat.

<span id="fn_968"></span>[294:2](sbe15113.htm#fr_971) M. reads tayor
antarâ*l*e *k*aush*n*yam prâsuvat.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[294:3](sbe15113.htm#fr_972) See
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka Up. V, 9; *Kh*ând. Up. III, 13, 8.

<span id="fn_970"></span>[294:4](sbe15113.htm#fr_973) The Vai*s*vânara
or purusha, according to the commentator, but originally the
Pra*g*âpati, who had made himself like air, and divided himself into
five vital airs.

<span id="fn_971"></span>[294:5](sbe15113.htm#fr_974) Thus the âtmâ,
with his own qualities and those which he assumes, becomes a living
being.

<span id="fn_972"></span>[294:6](sbe15113.htm#fr_975) M. reads esho 'sya
h*ri*dantare tish*th*ann.

<span id="fn_973"></span>[295:1](sbe15113.htm#fr_976) M. reads: Sa vâ
esha âtmeti ho*s*ann iva sitâsitai*h*. This seems better than u*s*anti
kavaya*h*, which hardly construes.

<span id="fn_974"></span>[295:2](sbe15113.htm#fr_977) M. reads
abhibhûyamânay iva, which again is better than anabhibhûta iva, for he
seems to be overcome, but is not, just as he seems to be an agent, but
is not. See also III, 1.

<span id="fn_975"></span>[295:3](sbe15113.htm#fr_978) M. has alepo.
