### SIXTH PRAPÂ*TH*AKA <span id="fr_1038"></span>[1](#fn_1035.md).

1\. He (the Self) bears the Self in two ways <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[2](#fn_1036), as he who is Prâ*n*a (breath.md), and as
he who is Âditya (the sun). Therefore there are two paths for him <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[3](#fn_1037.md), within and without, and they both
turn back in a day and night. The Sun is the outer Self, the inner Self
is Breath. Hence the motion of the inner Self is inferred from the
motion of the outer Self <span id="fr_1041"></span>[4](#fn_1038.md) For
thus it is said:

'He who knows, and has thrown off all evil, the overseer of the
senses <span id="fr_1042"></span>[5](#fn_1039.md), the pure-minded, firmly

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

grounded (in the Self) and looking away (from all earthly objects), he
is the same.' Likewise the motion of the outer Self is inferred from the
motion of the inner Self. For thus it is said:

'He who within the sun is the golden person, who looks upon this earth
from his golden place, he is the same who, after entering the inner
lotus of the heart <span id="fr_1043"></span>[1](#fn_1040.md), devours food
(perceives sensuous objects, &c.)'

2\. And he who having entered the inner lotus of the heart, devours
food, the same, having gone te, the sky as the fire of the sun, called
Time, and being invisible, devours all beings as his food.

What is that lotus and of what is it made? (the Vâlakhilyas ask <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[2](#fn_1041)..md)

That lotus is the same as the ether; the four quarters, and the four
intermediate points are its leaves <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[3](#fn_1042.md).

These two, Breath and the Sun, move on near to each other (in the heart
and in the ether). Let him worship these two, with the syllable Om, with
the Vyâh*ri*ti words (bhû*h*, bhuva*h*, svar), and with the Sâvitrî
hymn.

3\. There are two forms of Brahman <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[4](#fn_1043), the material (effect.md) and the
immaterial (cause). The material is false, the immaterial is true. That
which is true is Brahman, that which is Brahman is light, and that which
is light is the Sun <span id="fr_1047"></span>[5](#fn_1044.md). And this
Sun became the Self of that Om.

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

He divided himself threefold, for Om consists of three letters, a + u +
m. Through them all this <span id="fr_1048"></span>[1](#fn_1045.md) is
contained in him as warp and woof. For thus it is said:

'Meditate on that Sun as Om, join your Self (the breath) with the (Self
of the) Sun.'

4\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: The Udgîtha (of the Sâma-veda)
is the Pra*n*ava <span id="fr_1049"></span>[2](#fn_1046.md) (of the
*Ri*g-veda), and the Pra*n*ava is the Udgîtha, and thus the Sun is
Udgîtha, and he is Pra*n*ava or Om. For thus it is said <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[3](#fn_1047.md):

'The Udgîtha, called Pra*n*ava, the leader (in the performance of
sacrifices), the bright <span id="fr_1051"></span>[4](#fn_1048.md), the
sleepless, free from old age and death, three-footed <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[5](#fn_1049.md), consisting of three letters (a + u +
m), and likewise to be known as fivefold (five prâ*n*as) placed in the
cave.' And it is also said:

'The three-footed Brahman has its root upward <span
id="fr_1053"></span>[6](#fn_1050.md), the branches are ether, wind, fire,
water, earth, &c. This one Asvattha <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[7](#fn_1051.md) by name, the world, is Brahman, and of
it that is the light which is called the Sun, and it is also the light
of that syllable Om. Therefore let him for ever worship that (breath and
sun, as manifestations of Brahman) with the syllable Om.'

He alone enlightens us. For thus it is said:

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

'This alone is the pure syllable, this alone is the highest syllable; he
who knows that syllable only, whatever he desires, is his <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1](#fn_1052.md).'

5\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: This Om <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[2](#fn_1053.md) is the sound-endowed body of him
(Prâ*n*âdityâtman). This is his gender-endowed body, viz. feminine,
masculine, neuter. This is his light-endowed body, viz. Agni, Vâyu,
Âditya. This is his lord-endowed body, viz. Brahmâ, Rudra, Vish*n*u.
This is his mouth-endowed body, viz. Gârhapatya, Dakshi*n*âgni,
Âhavanîya <span id="fr_1057"></span>[3](#fn_1054.md). This is his
knowledge-endowed body, viz. *Rik*, Ya*g*us, Sâman. This is his
world-endowed body, viz. Bhû*h*, Bhuva*h*, Svar. This is his
time-endowed body, viz. Past, Present, Future. This is his heat-endowed
body, viz. Breath, Fire, Sun. This is his growth-endowed body, viz.
Food, Water, Moon. This is his thought-endowed body, viz. intellect,
mind, personality. This is his breath-endowed body, viz. Prâ*n*a, Apâna,
Vyâna. Therefore by the aforesaid syllable Om are all these here
enumerated bodies praised and identified (with the Prâ*n*âdityâtman).
For thus it is said <span id="fr_1058"></span>[4](#fn_1055.md):

'O Satyakâma, the syllable Om is the high and the low Brahman.'

6\. This <span id="fr_1059"></span>[5](#fn_1056) (world.md) was
unuttered <span id="fr_1060"></span>[6](#fn_1057.md). Then forsooth
Pra*g*âpati, having brooded, uttered it in the words Bhû*h*, Bhuva*h*,
Svar. This is the grossest body of that Pra*g*âpati, consisting of the
three worlds <span id="fr_1061"></span>[7](#fn_1058.md). Of that body Svar
is the head, Bhuva*h* the navel, Bhû*h*

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

the feet, the sun the eye. For in the eye is fixed man's great measure,
because with the eye he makes all measurements. The eye is truth
(satyam), for the person (purusha) dwelling in the eye proceeds to all
things (knows all objects with certainty). Therefore let a man worship
with the Vyâh*ri*tis, Bhû*h*, Bhuva*h*, Svar, for thus Pra*g*âpati, the
Self of All, is worshipped as the (sun, the) Eye of All <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[1](#fn_1059.md). For thus it is said:

'This (the sun) is Pra*g*âpati's all-supporting body, for in it this
all <span id="fr_1063"></span>[2](#fn_1060.md) is hid (by the light of the
sun); and in this all it (the light) is hid. Therefore this is
worshipped <span id="fr_1064"></span>[3](#fn_1061.md).'

7\. (The Sâvitrî begins <span id="fr_1065"></span>[4](#fn_1062):.md) Tat
Savitur vare*n*yam, i.e. 'this of Savit*ri*, to be chosen.' Here the
Âditya (sun) is Savit*ri*, and the same is to be chosen by the love(r)
of Self, thus say the Brahma-teachers.

(Then follows the next foot in the Savit*ri*): Bhargo devasya dhîmahi,
i.e. 'the splendour of the god we meditate on.' Here the god is
Savit*ri*, and therefore he who is called his splendour, him I meditate
on, thus say the Brahma-teachers.

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

(Then follows the last foot): Dhiyo yo na*h* pra*k*odayât, i.e. 'who
should stir up our thoughts.' Here the dhiya*h* are thoughts, and he
should stir these up for us, thus say the Brahma-teachers.

(He now explains the word bhargas). Now he who is called bhargas is he
who is placed in yonder Âditya (sun), or he who is the pupil in the
eye <span id="fr_1066"></span>[1](#fn_1063.md). And he is so called,
because his going (gati) is by rays (bhâbhi*h*); or because he parches
(bhar*g*ayati) and makes the world to shrivel up. Rudra is called
Bhargas, thus say the Brahma-teachers. Or bha means that he lights up
these worlds; ra, that he delights these beings, ga that these creatures
go to him and come from him; therefore being a bha-ra-ga, he is called
Bhargas.

Sûrya <span id="fr_1067"></span>[2](#fn_1064) (sun.md) is so called,
because Soma is continually squeezed out (su). Savit*ri* (sun) is so
called, because he brings forth (su). Âditya (sun) is so called, because
he takes up (âdâ, scil. vapour, or the life of man). Pâvana <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[3](#fn_1065.md) is so called, because he purifies
(pu). Apas, water, is so called, because it nourishes (pyâ).

And it is said:

'Surely the Self (absorbed in Prâ*n*a, breath), which is called
Immortal <span id="fr_1069"></span>[4](#fn_1066.md), is the thinker, the
perceiver, the goer, the evacuator <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[5](#fn_1067.md), the delighter, the doer, the speaker,
the taster, the smeller, the seer, the hearer, and he touches. He is
Vibhu (the pervader), who has entered into the body.' And it is said:

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

'When the knowledge is twofold (subjective and objective), then he
hears, sees, smells, tastes, and touches (something), for it is the Self
that knows everything.'

But when the knowledge is not twofold (subjective only), without effect,
cause, and action <span id="fr_1071"></span>[1](#fn_1068.md), without a
name, without a comparison, without a predicate <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[2](#fn_1069.md)--what is that? It cannot be told <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[3](#fn_1070.md).

8\. And the same Self is also called I*s*âna (lord), *S*ambhu, Bhava,
Rudra (tâmasa); Pra*g*âpati (lord of creatures), Vi*s*vas*rig* (creator
of all), Hira*n*yagarbha, Satyam (truth), Prâ*n*a, (breath), Ha*m*sa
(râ*g*asa); *S*âst*ri* (ruler), Vish*n*u, Nârâya*n*a (sâttvika); Arka,
Savit*ri*, Dhât*ri* (supporter), Vidhât*ri* <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[4](#fn_1071) (creator), Samrâ*g* (king.md), Indra,
Indu (moon). He is also he who warms, the Sun, hidden by the
thousand-eyed golden egg, as one fire by another. He is to be thought
after, he is to be sought after. Having said farewell to all living
beings, having gone to the forest, and having renounced all sensuous
objects, let man perceive the Self <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[5](#fn_1072.md) from his own body.

'(See him) <span id="fr_1076"></span>[6](#fn_1073.md) who assumes all
forms, the golden, who knows all things, who ascends highest, alone in
his splendour, and warms us; the thousand-rayed,

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

who abides in a hundred places, the spirit of all creatures, the Sun,
rises <span id="fr_1077"></span>[1](#fn_1074.md).'

9\. Therefore he who by knowing this has become the Self of both Breath
and Sun, meditates (while meditating on them) on his Self, sacrifices
(while sacrificing to them) to his Self-this meditation, the mind thus
absorbed in these acts, is praised by the wise.

Then let him purify the contamination of the mind by the verse
U*kkh*ish*t*opahatam, &c. <span id="fr_1078"></span>[2](#fn_1075.md): 'Be
it food left, or food defiled by left food, be it food given by a
sinner, food coming from a dead person, or from one impure from
childbirth, may the purifying power of Vasu, may Agni, and the rays of
Savit*ri*, purify it, and all my sin <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[3](#fn_1076.md).'

First (before eating) he surrounds (the offered food) with water (in
rincing his mouth <span id="fr_1080"></span>[4](#fn_1077).md) . Then
saying, Svâhâ to Prâ*n*a, Svâhâ to Apâna, Svâhâ to Vyâna, Svâhâ to
Samâna, Svâhâ to Udâna, he offers (the food) with five invocations (in
the fire of the mouth). What is over, he eats in silence, and then he
surrounds (the food) once more afterwards with water (rincing the mouth
after his meal). Having washed let him, after sacrificing to himself,
meditate on his Self with these two verses, Prâ*n*o 'gni*h* and Vi*s*vo
'si, viz. 'May the Highest Self as breath, as fire (digestive heat), as
consisting of the

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

five vital airs, having entered (the body), himself satisfied, satisfy
all, he who protects all.' 'Thou art Vi*s*va (all), thou art
Vai*s*vânara (fire), all that is born is upheld by thee; may all
offerings enter into thee; creatures live where thou grantest
immortality to all.' He who eats according to this rule, does not in
turn become food for others.

10\. There is something else to be known. There is a further
modification of this Self-sacrifice (the eating), namely, the food and
the eater thereof. This is the explanation. The thinking Purusha
(person), when he abides within the Pradhâna (nature), is the feeder who
feeds on the food supplied by Prak*ri*ti (nature). The elemental
Self <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1](#fn_1078.md) is truly his food, his
maker being Pradhâna (nature <span id="fr_1082"></span>[2](#fn_1079).md).
Therefore what is composed of the three qualities (gu*n*as) is the food,
but the person within is the feeder. And for this the evidence is
supplied by the senses. For animals spring from seed, and as the seed is
the food, therefore it is clear that what is food is Pradhâna (the seed
or cause of everything). Therefore, as has been said, the Purusha
(person) is the eater, Prak*ri*ti, the food; and abiding within it he
feeds. All that begins with the Mahat <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[3](#fn_1080) (power of intellect.md) and ends with the
Vi*s*eshas (elements <span id="fr_1084"></span>[4](#fn_1081).md), being
developed from the distinction of nature with its three qualities, is
the sign (that there must be a Purusha, an intelligent

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

subject). And in this manner the way with its fourteen steps has been
explained <span id="fr_1085"></span>[1](#fn_1082.md). (This is comprehended
in the following verse): 'This world is indeed the food, called
pleasure, pain, and error (the result of the three qualities); there is
no laying hold of the taste of the seed (cause), so long as there is no
development (in the shape of effect).' And in its three stages also it
has the character of food, as childhood, youth, and old age; for,
because these are developed, therefore there is in them the character of
food <span id="fr_1086"></span>[2](#fn_1083.md).

And in the following manner does the perception of Pradhâna (nature)
take place, after it has become manifest:--Intellect and the rest, such
as determination, conception, consciousness, are for the tasting (of the
effects of Pradhâna). Then there are the five (perceptive organs)
intended for the (five) objects of senses, for to taste them. And thus
are all acts of the five active organs, and the acts of the five
Prâ*n*as or vital airs (for the tasting of their corresponding objects).
Thus what is manifest (of nature) is food, and what is not manifest is
food. The enjoyer of it is without qualities, but because he has the
quality of being an enjoyer, it follows that he possesses intelligence.

As Agni (fire) is the food-eater among the gods, and Soma the food, so
he who knows this eats food by Agni (is not defiled by food, as little
as Agni, the sacrificial fire). This elemental Self, called Soma (food),
is also called Agni, as having undeveloped nature for its mouth (as
enjoying through nature, and being independent of it), because it is
said, 'The

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Purusha (person)
enjoys nature with its three qualities, by the mouth of undeveloped
nature.' He who knows this, is an ascetic, a yogin, he is a performer of
the Self-sacrifice (see before). And he who does not touch the objects
of the senses when they intrude on him, as no one would touch women
intruding into an empty house, he is an ascetic, a yogin, a performer of
the Self-sacrifice.

11\. This is the highest form of Self, viz. food, for this Prâ*n*a (this
body) subsists on food. If it eats not, it cannot perceive, hear, touch,
see, smell, taste, and it loses the vital airs <span
id="fr_1087"></span>[1](#fn_1084.md). For thus it is said:

'If it eats, then in full possession of the vital airs, it can perceive,
hear, touch, speak, taste, smell, see.' And thus it is said:

'From food are born all creatures that live on earth; afterwards they
live on food, and in the end (when they die) they return to it <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[2](#fn_1085.md).'

12\. And thus it is said elsewhere: Surely all these creatures run about
day and night, wishing to catch food. The sun takes food with his rays,
and by it he shines. These vital airs digest, when sprinkled with food.
Fire flares up by food, and by Brahmâ (Pra*g*âpati), desirous of food,
has all this been made. Therefore let a man worship food as his Self.
For thus it is said:

'From food creatures are born, by food they grow when born; because it
is eaten and because it cats creatures, therefore it is called food
(annam).'

13\. And thus it is said elsewhere: This food is the body of the blessed
Vish*n*u, called Vi*s*vabh*ri*t (all-sustaining). Breath is the essence
of food, mind of breath, knowledge of mind, joy of knowledge. He

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

who knows this is possessed of food, breath, mind, knowledge, and joy.
Whatever creatures here on earth eat food, abiding in them he, who knows
this, eats food. Food has been called undecaying, food has been called
worshipful; food is the breath of animals, food is the oldest, food has
been called the physician.

14\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: Food is the cause of all this,
time of food, and the sun is the cause of time <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1](#fn_1086). The (visible.md) form of time is the
year, consisting of twelve months, made up of Nimeshas (twinklings) and
other measures. Of the year one half (when the sun moves northward)
belongs to Agni, the other to Varu*n*a (when the sun moves southward).
That which belongs to Agni begins with the asterism of Maghâ, and ends
with half of the asterism of Sravish*th*â, the sun stepping down
northward. That which belongs to Soma (instead of Varu*n*a) begins with
the asterism (of A*s*leshâ), sacred to the Serpents, and ends with half
of the asterism of Sravish*th*â, the sun stepping up southward. And then
there (are the months) one by one, belonging to the year, each
consisting of nine-fourths of asterisms (two asterisms and a quarter
being the twelfth part of the passage of the sun through the
twenty-seven Nakshatras), each determined by the sun moving together
with the asterisms. Because time is imperceptible by sense, therefore
this (the progress of the sun, &c.) is its evidence, and by it alone is
time proved to exist. Without proof there is no apprehension of what is
to be proved; but even what is to be proved can become proof, for the
sake of making itself known,

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

if the parts (the twinklings, &c.) can be distinguished from the whole
(time <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1](#fn_1087).md). For thus it is said:

'As many portions of time as there are, through them the sun proceeds:
he who worships time as Brahman, from him time moves away very far.' And
thus it is said:

'From time all beings flow, from time they grow; in time they obtain
rest; time is visible (sun) and invisible (moments).'

15\. There are two forms of Brahman, time and non-time. That which was
before the (existence of the) sun is non-time and has no parts. That
which had its beginning from the sun is time and has parts. Of that
which has parts, the year is the form, and from the year are born all
creatures; when produced by the year they grow, and go again to rest in
the year. Therefore the year is Pra*g*âpati, is time, is food, is the
nest of Brahman, is Self. Thus it is said:

'Time ripens and dissolves all beings in the great Self, but he who
knows into what time itself is dissolved, he is the knower of the Veda.'

16\. This manifest time is the great ocean of creatures. He who is
called Savit*ri* (the sun, as begetter) dwells in it, from whence the
moon, stars, planets, the year, and the rest are begotten. From them
again comes all this, and thus, whatever of good or evil is seen in this
world, comes from them. Therefore Brahman is the Self of the sun, and a
man should worship the sun under the name of time. Some say the sun is
Brahman, and thus it is said:

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

'The sacrificer, the deity that enjoys the sacrifice, the oblation, the
hymn, the sacrifice, Vish*n*u, Pra*g*âpati, all this is the Lord, the
witness, that shines in yonder orb.'

17\. In the beginning Brahman was all this <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[1](#fn_1088.md). He was one, and infinite; infinite in
the East, infinite in the South, infinite in the West, infinite in the
North, above and below and everywhere infinite. East and the other
regions do not exist for him, nor across, nor below, nor above. The
Highest Self is not to be fixed, he is unlimited, unborn, not to be
reasoned about, not to be conceived. He is like the ether (everywhere),
and at the destruction of the universe, he alone is awake. Thus from
that ether he wakes all this world, which consists of thought only, and
by him alone is all this meditated on, and in him it is dissolved. His
is that luminous form which shines in the sun, and the manifold light in
the smokeless fire, and the heat which in the stomach digests the food.
Thus it is said:

'He who is in the fire, and he who is in the heart, and he who is in the
sun, they are one and the same.'

He who knows this becomes one with the one.

18\. This is the rule for achieving it (viz. concentration of the mind
on the object of meditation): restraint of the breath, restraint of the
senses, meditation, fixed attention, investigation, absorption, these
are called the sixfold Yoga <span id="fr_1092"></span>[2](#fn_1089.md).
When beholding by

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

this Yoga, he beholds the gold-coloured maker, the lord, the person,
Brahman, the cause, then the sage, leaving behind good and evil, makes
everything (breath, organs of sense, body, &c.) to be one in the Highest
Indestructible (in the pratyagâtman or Brahman). And thus it is said:

'As birds and deer do not approach a burning mountain, so sins never
approach those who know Brahman.'

19\. And thus it is said elsewhere: When he who knows has, while he is
still Prâ*n*a (breath), restrained his mind, and placed all objects of
the senses far away from himself, then let him remain without any
conceptions. And because the living person, called Prâ*n*a (breath), has
been produced here on earth from that which is not Prâ*n*a (the thinking
Self), therefore let this Prâ*n*a merge the Prâ*n*a (himself) in what is
called the fourth <span id="fr_1093"></span>[1](#fn_1090.md). And thus it
is said:

'What is without thought, though placed in the centre of thought, what
cannot be thought, the hidden, the highest--let a man merge his thought
there: then will this living being (liṅga) be without attachment <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[2](#fn_1091.md).'

20\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: There is the superior fixed
attention (dhâra*n*â) for him, viz. if he presses the tip of the tongue
down the palate and restrains voice, mind, and breath, he sees

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

Brahman by discrimination (tarka). And when, after the cessation of
mind <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1](#fn_1092.md), he sees his own Self,
smaller than small, and shining, as the Highest Self <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[2](#fn_1093.md), then having seen his Self as the
Self, he becomes Self-less, and because he is Self-less, he is without
limit, without cause, absorbed in thought. This is the highest mystery,
viz. final liberation. And thus it is said:

'Through the serenity of the thought he kills all actions, good or bad;
his Self serene, abiding in the Self, obtains imperishable bliss.'

2 1. And thus it has been said elsewhere: The artery, called Sushumnâ,
going upwards (from the heart to the Brahmarandhra), serving as the
passage of the Prâ*n*a, is divided within the palate. Through that
artery, when it has been joined by the breath (held in subjection), by
the sacred syllable Om, and by the mind (absorbed in the contemplation
of Brahman), let him proceed upwards <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[3](#fn_1094.md), and after turning the tip of the
tongue to the palate, without <span id="fr_1098"></span>[4](#fn_1095.md)
using any of the organs of sense, let greatness perceive greatness <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[5](#fn_1096.md). From thence he goes to selflessness,
and through selflessness he ceases to be an enjoyer of pleasure and
pain, he obtains aloneness (kevalatva, final deliverance). And thus it
is said:

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

'Having successively fixed the breath, after it had been restrained, in
the palate, thence having crossed the limit (the life), let him join
himself afterwards to the limitless (Brahman) in the crown of the head.'

22\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: Two Brahmans have to be
meditated on, the word and the non-word. By the word alone is the
non-word revealed. Now there is the word Om. Moving upward by it (where
all words and all what is meant by them ceases), he arrives at
absorption in the non-word (Brahman). This is the way, this is the
immortal, this is union, and this is bliss. And as the spider, moving
upward by the thread, gains free space, thus also he who meditates,
moving upward by the syllable Om, gains independence.

Other teachers of the word (as Brahman) think otherwise. They listen to
the sound of the ether within the heart while they stop the ears with
the thumbs. They compare it to seven noises, like rivers, like a bell,
like a brazen vessel, like the wheels of a carriage, like the croaking
of frogs, like rain, and as if a man speaks in a cavern. Having passed
beyond this variously apprehended sound, and having settled in the
supreme, soundless (non-word), unmanifested Brahman, they become
undistinguished and undistinguishable, as various flavours of the
flowers are lost in the taste of honey. And thus it is said:

'Two Brahmans are to be known, the word-Brahman and the highest Brahman;
he who is perfect in the word-Brahman attains the highest Brahman <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[1](#fn_1097.md).'

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

23\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: The syllable Om is what is
called the word. And its end is the silent, the soundless, fearless,
sorrowless, joyful, satisfied, firm, unwavering, immortal, immovable,
certain (Brahman), called Vish*n*u. Let him worship these two, that he
may obtain what is higher than everything (final deliverance). For thus
it is said:

'He who is the high and the highest god <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[1](#fn_1098.md), by name Om-kâra, he is soundless and
free from all distinctions: therefore let a man dwell on him in the
crown of his head.'

24\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: The body is the bow, the
syllable Om is the arrow, its point is the mind. Having cut through the
darkness, which consists of ignorance <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[2](#fn_1099.md), it approaches that which is not
covered by darkness <span id="fr_1103"></span>[3](#fn_1100.md). Then having
cut through that which was covered (the personal soul), he saw Brahman,
flashing like a wheel on fire, bright like the sun, vigorous, beyond all
darkness, that which shines forth in yonder sun, in the moon, in the
fire, in the lightning <span id="fr_1104"></span>[4](#fn_1101.md). And
having seen him, he obtains immortality. And thus it has been said:

'Meditation is directed to the highest Being (Brahman) within, and
(before) to the objects (body, Om, mind); thence the indistinct
understanding becomes distinct.

And when the works of the mind are dissolved,

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

then that bliss which requires no other witness, that is Brahman
(Âtman), the immortal, the brilliant, that is the way, that is the
(true) world.'

25\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: He who has his senses hidden
as in sleep, and who, while in the cavern of his senses (his body), but
no longer ruled by them, sees, as in a dream, with the purest intellect,
Him who is called Pra*n*ava (Om), the leader <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[1](#fn_1102.md), the bright, the sleepless, free from
old age, from death, and sorrow, he is himself also called Pra*n*ava,
and becomes a leader, bright, sleepless, free from old age, from death,
and sorrow. And thus it is said:

'Because in this manner he joins the Prâ*n*a (breath), the Om, and this
Universe in its manifold forms, or because they join themselves (to
him), therefore this (process of meditation) is called Yoga (joining).

The oneness of breath, mind, and senses, and then the surrendering of
all conceptions, that is called Yoga.'

26\. And thus it has also been said elsewhere: As a sportsman, after
drawing out the denizens of the waters with a net, offers them (as a
sacrifice) in the fire of his stomach, thus are these Prâ*n*as (vital
airs), after they have been drawn out with the syllable Om, offered in
the faultless fire (Brahman) <span id="fr_1106"></span>[2](#fn_1103.md).

Hence he is like a heated vessel (full of clarified butter); for as the
clarified butter in the heated vessel lights up, when touched with grass
and sticks, thus does this being which is called Not-breath (Âtman)
light up, when touched by the Prâ*n*as (the

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

vital airs) <span id="fr_1107"></span>[1](#fn_1104.md). And that which
flares up, that is the manifest form of Brahman, that is the highest
place of Vish*n*u <span id="fr_1108"></span>[2](#fn_1105.md), that is the
essence of Rudra. And this, dividing his Self in endless ways, fills all
these worlds. And thus it is said:

'As the sparks from the fire, and as the rays from the sun, thus do his
Prâ*n*as and the rest in proper order again and again proceed from him
here on earth <span id="fr_1109"></span>[3](#fn_1106.md).'

27\. And thus it has also been said elsewhere: This is the heat of the
highest, the immortal, the incorporeal Brahman, viz. the warmth of the
body. And this body is the clarified butter (poured on it, by which the
heat of Brahman, otherwise invisible, is lighted up). Then, being
manifest, it is placed in the ether (of the heart). Then by
concentration they thus remove that ether which is within the heart, so
that its light appears, as it were <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[4](#fn_1107.md). Therefore the worshipper becomes
identified with that light without much delay. As a ball of iron, if
placed in the earth, becomes earth without much delay, and as, when it
has once become a clod of earth, fire and smiths have nothing more to do
with that ball of iron, thus does thought (without delay) disappear,
together with its support <span id="fr_1111"></span>[5](#fn_1108.md). And
thus it is said:

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

'The shrine which consists of the ether in the heart, the blissful, the
highest retreat, that is our own, that is our goal, and that is the heat
and brightness of the fire and the sun.'

28\. And thus it has been said elsewhere: After having left behind the
body, the organs of sense, and the objects of sense (as no longer
belonging to us), and having seized the bow whose stick is fortitude and
whose string is asceticism, having struck down also with the arrow,
which consists in freedom from egotism, the first guardian of the door
of Brahman (for if man looks at the world egotistically, then, taking
the diadem of passion, the earrings of greed and envy, and the staff of
sloth, sleep, and sin, and having seized the bow whose string is anger,
and whose stick is lust, he destroys with the arrow which consists of
wishes, all beings)--having therefore killed that guardian, he crosses
by means of the boat Om to the other side of the ether within the heart,
and when the ether becomes revealed (as Brahman), he enters slowly, as a
miner seeking minerals in a mine, into the Hall of Brahman. After that
let him, by means of the doctrine of his teacher, break through the
shrine of Brahman, which consists of the four nets (of food, breath,
mind, knowledge, till he reaches the last shrine, that of blessedness
and identity with Brahman). Thenceforth pure,

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

clean, undeveloped, tranquil, breathless, bodiless, endless,
imperishable, firm, everlasting, unborn and independent, he stands on
his own greatness <span id="fr_1112"></span>[1](#fn_1109.md), and having
seen (the Self), standing in his own greatness, he looks on the wheel of
the world as one (who has alighted from a chariot) looks on its
revolving wheel. And thus it is said:

'If a man practises Yoga for six months and is thoroughly free (from the
outer world), then the perfect Yoga (union), which is endless, high, and
hidden, is accomplished.

But if a man, though well enlightened (by instruction), is still pierced
by (the gu*n*as of) passion and darkness, and attached to his children,
wife, and house, then perfect Yoga is never accomplished <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[2](#fn_1110.md).'

29\. After he had thus spoken (to B*ri*hadratha), *S*âkâyanya, absorbed
in thought, bowed before him, and said: 'O King, by means of this
Brahma-knowledge have the sons of Pra*g*âpati (the Vâlakhilyas) gone to
the road of Brahman. Through the practice of Yoga a man obtains
contentment, power to endure good and evil, and tranquillity. Let no man
preach this most secret doctrine to any one who is not his son or his
pupil <span id="fr_1114"></span>[3](#fn_1111.md), and who is not of a
serene mind. To him alone who is devoted to his teacher only, and
endowed with all necessary qualities, may he communicate it <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[4](#fn_1112.md).

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

30\. Om! Having settled down in a pure place let him, being pure
himself, and firm in goodness, study the truth, speak the truth, think
the truth, and offer sacrifice to the truth <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[1](#fn_1113.md). Henceforth he has become another; by
obtaining the reward of Brahman his fetters are cut asunder, he knows no
hope, no fear from others as little as from himself, he knows no
desires; and having attained imperishable, infinite happiness, he stands
blessed in the true Brahman, who longs for a true man <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[2](#fn_1114.md). Freedom from desires is, as it were,
the highest prize to be taken from the best treasure (Brahman). For a
man full of all desires, being possessed of will, imagination, and
belief, is a slave; but he who is the opposite, is free.

Here some say, it is the Gu*n*a <span id="fr_1118"></span>[3](#fn_1115.md)
(i. e. the so-called Mahat, the principle of intellect which, according
to the Sâṅkhyas, is the result of the Gu*n*as or qualities), which,
through the differences of nature (acquired in the former states of
existence), goes into bondage to the will, and that deliverance takes
place (for the Gu*n*a) when the fault of the will has been removed. (But
this is not our view), because (call it gu*n*a, intellect, buddhi,
manas, mind, ahaṅkâra, egotism, it is not the mind that acts, but) he
sees by the mind (as his instrument), he hears by the mind; and all that
we call

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

desire, imagination, doubt, belief, unbelief, certainty, uncertainty,
shame, thought, fear, all that is but mind (manas). Carried along by the
waves of the qualities, darkened in his imaginations, unstable, fickle,
crippled, full of desires, vacillating, he enters into belief, believing
I am he, this is mine, and he binds his Self by his Self, as a bird with
a net <span id="fr_1119"></span>[1](#fn_1116.md). Therefore a man, being
possessed of will, imagination, and belief, is a slave, but he who is
the opposite is free. For this reason let a man stand free from will,
imagination, and belief--this is the sign of liberty, this is the path
that leads to Brahman, this is the opening of the door, and through it
he will go to the other shore of darkness. All desires are there
fulfilled. And for this they quote a verse:

" When the five instruments of knowledge stand still together with the
mind, and when the intellect does not move, that is called the highest
state <span id="fr_1120"></span>[2](#fn_1117.md)."'

Having thus said, Sâkâyanya became absorbed in thought. Then Marut (i.e.
the King B*ri*hadratha) <span id="fr_1121"></span>[3](#fn_1118.md), having
bowed before him and duly worshipped him, went full of contentment to
the Northern Path <span id="fr_1122"></span>[4](#fn_1119.md), for there is
no way thither by any side-road. This is the path to Brahman. Having
burst open the solar door, he rose on high and went away. And here they
quote:

'There are endless rays (arteries) for the Self who, like a lamp, dwells
in the heart: white and black, brown and blue, tawny and reddish <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[5](#fn_1120.md).

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

One of them (the Sushumnâ) leads upwards, piercing the solar orb: by it,
having stepped beyond the world of Brahman, they go to the highest path.

The other hundred rays <span id="fr_1124"></span>[1](#fn_1121.md) rise
upwards also, and on them the worshipper reaches the mansions belonging
to the different bodies of gods.

But the manifest rays of dim colour which lead downwards, by them a man
travels on and on helplessly, to enjoy the fruits of his actions here.'

Therefore it is said that the holy Âditya (sun) is the cause of new
births (to those who do not worship him), of heaven (to those who
worship him as a god), of liberty (to those who worship him as
Brahman) <span id="fr_1125"></span>[2](#fn_1122.md).

31\. Some one asks: 'Of what nature are those organs of sense that go
forth (towards their objects)? Who sends them out here, or who holds
them back?'

Another answers: 'Their nature is the Self; the Self sends them out, or
holds them back; also the Apsaras (enticing objects of sense), and the
solar rays (and other deities presiding over the senses).'

Now the Self devours the objects by the five rays (the organs of sense);
then who is the Self?

He who has been defined by the terms pure, clean, undeveloped,
tranquil <span id="fr_1126"></span>[3](#fn_1123.md), &c., who is to be
apprehended independently by his own peculiar signs. That sign of him
who has no signs, is like what the pervading

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

heat is of fire, the purest taste of water; thus say some <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[1](#fn_1124.md). It is speech, hearing, sight, mind,
breath; thus say others <span id="fr_1128"></span>[2](#fn_1125.md). It is
intellect, retention, remembering, knowledge; thus say others <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[3](#fn_1126.md). Now all these are signs of the Self
in the same sense in which here on earth shoots are the signs of seed,
or smoke, light, and sparks of fire. And for this they quote <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[4](#fn_1127.md):

'As the sparks from the fire, and as the rays from the sun, thus do his
Prâ*n*as and the rest in proper order again and again proceed from him
here on earth.'

32\. From this very Self, abiding within his Self, come forth all
Prâ*n*as (speech, &c.), all worlds, all Vedas, all gods, and all beings;
its Upanishad (revelation) <span id="fr_1131"></span>[5](#fn_1128.md) is
that it is 'the true of the true.' Now as from a fire of green wood,
when kindled, clouds of smoke come forth by themselves (though belonging
to the fire), thus from that great Being has been breathed forth all
this which is the *Ri*g-veda, the Ya*g*ur-veda, the Sama-veda, the
Atharvâṅgirasas (Atharva-veda), the Itihâsa (legendary stories), the
Purâ*n*a (accounts of the creation, &c.), Vidyâ (ceremonial doctrines),
the Upanishads, the *S*lokas (verses interspersed in the Upanishads,
&c.), the Sûtras (compendious statements), the Anuvyâkhyânas
(explanatory notes), the Vyâkhyânas (elucidations) <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[6](#fn_1129.md)--all these things are his.

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

33\. This fire (the Gârhapatya-fire) with five bricks is the year. And
its five bricks are spring, summer, rainy season, autumn, winter; and by
them the fire has a head, two sides, a centre, and a tail. This earth
(the Gârhapatya-fire) here is the first sacrificial pile for
Pra*g*âpati, who knows the Purusha (the Virâ*g*). It presented the
sacrificer to Vâyu, (the wind) by lifting him with the hands to the sky.
That Vâyu is Prâ*n*a (Hira*n*yagarbha).

Prâ*n*a is Agni (the Dakshi*n*âgni-fire), and its bricks are the five
vital breaths, Prâ*n*a, Vyâna, Apâna, Samâna, Udâna; and by them the
fire has a head, two sides, a centre, and a tail. This sky (the
Dakshi*n*âgni-fire) here is the second sacrificial pile for Pra*g*âpati,
who knows the Purusha. It presented the sacrificer to Indra, by lifting
him with the hands to heaven. That Indra is Âditya, the sun.

That (Indra) is the Agni (the Âhavanîya-fire), and its bricks are the
*Rik*, the Ya*g*ush, the Sâman, the Atharvâṅgirasas, the Itihâsa, and
the Purâ*n*a; and by them the fire has a head, two sides, a tail, and a
centre. This heaven (Âhavanîya-fire) is the third sacrificial pile for
Pra*g*âpati, who knows the

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Purusha. With the
hands it makes a present of the sacrificer to the Knower of the Self
(Pra*g*âpati); then the Knower of the Self, lifting him up, presented
him to Brahman. In him he becomes full of happiness and joy.

34\. The earth is the Gârhapatya-fire, the sky the Dakshina-fire, the
heaven the Âhavanîya-fire; and therefore they are also the Pavamâna
(pure), the Pâvaka (purifying), and the *S*u*k*i (bright) <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[1](#fn_1130.md). By this (by the three deities,
Pavamâna, Pâvaka, and *S*u*k*i) the sacrifice (of the three fires, the
Gârhapatya, Dakshi*n*a, and Âhavanîya) is manifested. And because the
digestive fire also is a compound of the Pavamâna, Pâvaka, and *S*u*k*i,
therefore that fire is to receive oblations, is to be laid with bricks,
is to be praised, and to be meditated on. The sacrificer, when he has
seized the oblation, wishes <span id="fr_1134"></span>[2](#fn_1131.md) to
perform his meditation of the deity:

'The gold-coloured bird abides in the heart, and in the sun--a diver
bird, a swan, strong in splendour; him we worship in the fire.'

Having recited the verse, he discovers its meaning, viz. the adorable
splendour of Savit*ri* (sun) is to be meditated on by him who, abiding
within his mind, meditates thereon. Here he attains the place of rest
for the mind, he holds it within his own Self. On this there are the
following verses:

\(1\) As a fire without fuel becomes quiet in its

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

place <span id="fr_1135"></span>[1](#fn_1132.md), thus do the thoughts,
when all activity ceases, become quiet <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[2](#fn_1133.md) in their place.

\(2\) Even in a mind which loves the truth <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[3](#fn_1134.md) and has gone to rest in itself there
arise, when it is deluded by the objects of sense, wrongs resulting from
former acts <span id="fr_1138"></span>[4](#fn_1135.md).

\(3\) For thoughts alone cause the round of births <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[5](#fn_1136.md); let a man strive to purify his
thoughts. What a man thinks, that he is: this is the old secret <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[6](#fn_1137.md).

\(4\) By the serenity of his thoughts a man blots out all actions,
whether good or bad. Dwelling within his Self with serene thoughts, he
obtains imperishable happiness.

\(5\) If the thoughts of a man were so fixed on Brahman as they are on
the things of this world, who would not then be freed from bondage?

\(6\) The mind, it is said, is of two kinds, pure or impure; impure from
the contact with lust, pure when free from lust <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[7](#fn_1138.md).

\(7\) When a man, having freed his mind from sloth, distraction, and
vacillation, becomes as it were delivered from his mind <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[8](#fn_1139.md), that is the highest point.

\(8\) The mind must be restrained in the heart till it comes to an
end;--that is knowledge, that is liberty: all the rest are extensions of
the ties <span id="fr_1143"></span>[9](#fn_1140.md) (which bind us to this
life).

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

\(9\) That happiness which belongs to a mind which by deep meditation
has been washed <span id="fr_1144"></span>[1](#fn_1141.md) clean from all
impurity and has entered within the Self, cannot be described here by
words; it can be felt by the inward power only <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[2](#fn_1142.md).

\(10\) Water in water, fire in fire, ether in ether, no one can
distinguish them; likewise a man whose mind has entered (till it cannot
be distinguished from the Self), attains liberty.

\(11\) Mind alone is the cause of bondage and liberty for men; if
attached to the world, it becomes bound; if free from the world, that is
liberty <span id="fr_1146"></span>[3](#fn_1143.md).

Therefore those who do not offer the Agnihotra (as described above), who
do not lay the fires (with the bricks, as described above), who are
ignorant (of the mind being the cause of the round of births), who do
not meditate (on the Self in the solar orb) are debarred from
remembering the ethereal place of Brahman. Therefore that fire is to
receive oblations, is to be laid with bricks, is to be praised, to be
meditated on.

35 <span id="fr_1147"></span>[4](#fn_1144.md). Adoration to Agni, the
dweller on earth, who remembers his world. Grant that world to this thy
worshipper!

Adoration to Vâyu, the dweller in the sky, who remembers his world.
Grant that world to this thy worshipper!

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

Adoration to Âditya, the dweller in heaven, who remembers his world.
Grant that world to this thy worshipper!

Adoration to Brahman, who dwells everywhere, who remembers all. Grant
all to this thy worshipper!

The mouth of the true (Brahman) is covered with a golden lid; open that,
O Pûshan (sun), that we may go to the true one, who pervades all
(Vish*n*u) <span id="fr_1148"></span>[1](#fn_1145.md).

He who is the person in the sun, I am he <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[2](#fn_1146.md).

And what is meant by the true one is the essence of the sun, that which
is bright, personal, sexless <span id="fr_1150"></span>[3](#fn_1147.md); a
portion (only) of the light which pervades the ether; which is, as it
were, in the midst of the sun, and in the eye, and in the fire. That is
Brahman, that is immortal, that is splendour.

That is the true one, a portion (only) of the light which pervades the
ether, which is in the midst of the sun, the immortal, of which Soma
(the moon) and the vital breaths also are offshoots: that is Brahman,
that is immortal, that is splendour.

That is the true one, a portion (only) of the light which pervades the
ether, which in the midst of the sun shines as Ya*g*us, viz. as Om, as
water, light, essence, immortal, Brahman, Bhû*h*, Bhuva*h*, Svar, Om.

'The eight-footed <span id="fr_1151"></span>[4](#fn_1148.md), the bright,
the swan, bound

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

with three threads, the infinitely small, the imperishable, blind for
good and evil, kindled with light--he who sees him, sees everything.'

A portion (only) of the light which pervades the ether, are the two rays
rising in the midst of the sun. That is the knower <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[1](#fn_1149) (the Sun.md), the true one. That is the
Ya*g*us, that is the heat, that is Agni (fire), that is Vâyu (wind),
that is breath, that is water, that is the moon, that is bright, that is
immortal, that is the place of Brahman, that is the ocean of light. In
that ocean the sacrificers are dissolved <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[2](#fn_1150.md) like salt, and that is oneness with
Brahman, for all desires are there fulfilled. And here they quote:

'Like a lamp, moved by a gentle wind, he who dwells within the gods
shines forth. He who knows this, he is the knower, he knows the
difference (between the high and the highest Brahman); having obtained
unity, he becomes identified with it.

They who rise up in endless number, like spray drops (from the sea),
like lightnings from the light within the clouds in the highest heaven,
they, when they have entered into the light of glory (Brahman), appear
like so many flame-crests in the track of fire.'

36\. There are two manifestations of the Brahma-light: one is tranquil,
the other lively. Of that which is tranquil, the ether is the support;
of that which is lively, food. Therefore (to the former) sacrifice must
be offered on the house-altar with hymns, herbs, ghee, meat, cakes,
sthâlîpâka, and other things; to the latter, with meat and drinks
(belonging to the great sacrifices) thrown into the mouth, for the mouth

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

is the Âhavanîya-fire; and this is done to increase our bodily vigour,
to gain the world of purity, and for the sake of immortality. And here
they quote:

'Let him who longs for heaven, offer an Agnihotra. By an Agnish*t*oma he
wins the kingdom of Yama; by Uktha, the kingdom of Soma; by a
Sho*d*asin-sacrifice, the kingdom of Sûrya; by an Atirâtra-sacrifice,
the kingdom of Indra; by the sacrifices beginning with the twelve-night
sacrifice and ending with the thousand years' sacrifice, the world of
Pra*g*âpati.

As a lamp burns so long as the vessel that holds the wick is filled with
oil, these two, the Self and the bright Sun, remain so long as the egg
(of the world) and he who dwells within it hold together.'

37\. Therefore let a man perform all these ceremonies with the syllable
Om (at the beginning). Its splendour is endless, and it is declared to
be threefold, in the fire (of the altar), in the sun (the deity), in the
breath (the sacrificer). Now this is the channel to increase the food,
which makes what is offered in the fire ascend to the sun. The sap which
flows from thence, rains down as with the sound of a hymn. 'By it there
are vital breaths, from them there is offspring. And here they quote:

'The offering which is offered in the fire, goes to the sun; the sun
rains it down by his rays; thus food comes, and from food the birth of
living beings <span id="fr_1154"></span>[1](#fn_1151.md).'

And thus he said:

'The oblation which is properly thrown on the fire, goes toward the sun;
from the sun comes rain, from rain food, from food living beings'.'

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

38\. He who offers the Agnihotra breaks through the net of desire. Then,
cutting through bewilderment, never approving of anger, meditating on
one desire (that of liberty), he breaks through the shrine of Brahman
with its four nets, and proceeds thence to the ether. For having there
broken through the (four) spheres of the Sun, the Moon, the Fire, and
Goodness, he then, being purified himself, beholds dwelling in goodness,
immovable, immortal, indestructible, firm, bearing the name of Vish*n*u,
the highest abode, endowed with love of truth and omniscience, the
self-dependent Intelligence (Brahman), standing in its own greatness.
And here they quote:

'In the midst of the sun stands the moon, in the midst of the moon the
fire, in the midst of fire goodness, in the midst of goodness the
Eternal.'

Having meditated on him who has the breadth of a thumb within the span
(of the heart) in the body, who is smaller than small, he obtains the
nature of the Highest; there all desires are fulfilled. And on this they
quote:

'Having the breadth of a thumb within the span (of the heart) in the
body, like the flame of a lamp, burning twofold or threefold, that
glorified Brahman, the great God, has entered into all the worlds. Om!
Adoration to Brahman! Adoration!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1035"></span>[305:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1038.md) The commentator
describes the sixth and seventh chapters as Khila, supplementary, and
does not think that they are closely connected with the chief object of
the Upanishad. This chief object was to show that there is only one
thinking Self (*k*idâtmâ) to be known, and that the same is to be
meditated on as manifested in the different forms of Rudra, Brahmâ,
Vish*n*u, &c. Thus the highest object of those who wish for final
liberation has been explained before, as well as the proper means of
obtaining that liberation. What follows are statements of the greatness
of the various manifestations of the Âtman, and advice how to worship
them. My MS. gives the beginning of the sixth Prapâ*th*aka, but ends
with the end of the eighth paragraph. The verses in paragraph 34, as
mentioned before, are given in my MS. at the end of the fourth
Prapâ*th*aka. My translation deviates considerably from the commentary.
The text is obscure and not always correct. My rule has been throughout
to begin a new sentence with eva*m* hy âha, 'for thus it is said,' which
introduces proofs of what has been said before. The passages thus quoted
as proofs from the Veda are often difficult to understand, nor do they
always consist of a complete sentence. My translation therefore is often
purely tentative.

<span id="fn_1036"></span>[305:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1039.md) M. reads dvitîyâ

<span id="fn_1057"></span>[308:6](sbe15117.htm#fr_1060.md) So far the
pra*n*ava or Om has been explained; now follows the explanation of the
Vyâh*ri*tis; cf. VI, 2. Vyâh*ri*ti is derived from vyâhar, and means an
utterance.

<span id="fn_1058"></span>[308:7](sbe15117.htm#fr_1061.md) Cf. VI, 5.

<span id="fn_1059"></span>[309:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1062.md) M. reads
vi*s*vata*sk*akshur.

<span id="fn_1060"></span>[309:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1063.md) Pra*g*âpati,
according to the commentator, is identified with Satya, the true,
because sat means the three worlds, and these (bhû*h*, bhuva*h*, svar)
are said to be his body. Hence probably the insertion of Satyam before
Pra*g*âpati at the beginning of the paragraph. Then he argues, as the
eye has been called satya, and as the eye is Âditya, therefore
Pra*g*âpati also, being Satya, is Âditya, the sun. And again, if the sun
is worshipped (by the vyâh*ri*tis) then, like the sun, the eye of all,
Pra*g*âpati also, the self of all, is worshipped.

<span id="fn_1061"></span>[309:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1064.md) Eshopasîta is
impossible. We must either read, with the commentator, etam upâsîta, or
with M. eshopasiteti.

<span id="fn_1062"></span>[309:4](sbe15117.htm#fr_1065.md) He now proceeds
to explain the worship of the Sâvitrî verse, which had been mentioned in
VI, 2, after the Om and the Vyâh*ri*tis, as the third mode of
worshipping Prâ*n*a (breath) and Âditya (sun), these being two
correlative embodiments of the Self. The Sâvitrî is found in *Ri*g-veda
III, 6 2, 10, but it is here explained in a purely philosophical sense.
See also B*ri*h. Up. VI, 3, 6.

<span id="fn_1063"></span>[310:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1066.md) M. reads târake

<span id="fn_1064"></span>[310:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1067.md) Sûrya is

<span id="fn_1069"></span>[311:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1072.md) Nirupâkhyam,
rightly translated by Cowell by 'without a predicate,' and rendered by
the commentator by apramaya, i.e. not to be measured, not to be classed,
i.e. without a predicate.

<span id="fn_1070"></span>[311:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1073.md) I have
translated this in accordance with a well-known passage, quoted by the
commentator from the B*ri*hadâranyaka, rather than in accordance with
his own interpretation.

<span id="fn_1071"></span>[311:4](sbe15117.htm#fr_1074.md) M. leaves out
vidhâtâ.

peculiar Maitrâya*n*i reading, svâ*ñ* *s*ârîrâd, AI. reads svâ*s*
*kh*arîrâd.

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[311:6](sbe15117.htm#fr_1076.md) The oneness of
the Sun and the Breath is proclaimed in the following verse of the
Pra*sñ*a Upanishad I, 8.

<span id="fn_1074"></span>[312:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1077.md) Here ends the M.

Samâptâ.

paragraphs the taking of food is represented as a sacrifice offered by
the Self to the Self (âtmaya*g*anarûpam bho*g*anam, p. 106, l. 13).

<span id="fn_1076"></span>[312:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1079.md) Several words
have been inserted in this verse, spoiling the metre.

<span id="fn_1079"></span>[313:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1082.md) This is very
doubtful, in fact, unintelligible. The commentator says, asya

artha*h*.

<span id="fn_1080"></span>[313:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1083.md) Technical terms,
afterwards adopted by the Sâṅkhya philosophers.

<span id="fn_1081"></span>[313:4](sbe15117.htm#fr_1084.md) Professor Cowell
observes that the term vi*s*esha, as here applied to the five gross
elements, occurs in the Sâṅkhya-kârika, ver. 38.

<span id="fn_1082"></span>[314:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1085.md) Five receptive,
five active organs, and four kinds of consciousness.

<span id="fn_1083"></span>[314:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1086.md) Its very
development proves it to be food. Cowell.

2.

<span id="fn_1086"></span>[316:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1089.md) As food depends
on time, therefore time is praised, which again depends on the sun,
which is a form of the Self.

<span id="fn_1087"></span>[317:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1090.md) Thus, the
commentator says, the existence of the lamp can be proved by the light
of the lamp, as the existence of time is proved by what we see, the
rising of the sun. All this is very obscure.

<span id="fn_1088"></span>[318:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1091.md) Brahman used as
neuter, but immediately followed by eko 'nanta*h*, &c.

<span id="fn_1089"></span>[318:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1092.md) After having
explained the form of what is to be meditated on and the mode of
meditation, the Upanishad now teaches the Yoga which serves to keep our
thoughts in subjection, and to fix our thoughts on the object of
meditation. See Yoga-Sûtras II, 29.

<span id="fn_1090"></span>[319:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1093.md) The fourth stage
is meant for the thinking Self, the earlier stages being waking,
slumbering, and sleep.

<span id="fn_1091"></span>[319:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1094.md) Professor Cowell
offers two renderings of this difficult passage: 'This which is called
prâ*n*a, i.e. the individual soul as characterised by the subtil body,
will thus no longer appear in its separate individuality from the
absence of any conscious subject; or, this subtil body bearing the name
of intellect will thus become void of all objects.'

<span id="fn_1092"></span>[320:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1095.md) The commentator
remarks that this process is called Lambikâyoga, and the state produced
by it Unmanî or Unmanîbhâva; see amanîbhâva, in VI, 34, ver. 7.

<span id="fn_1093"></span>[320:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1096.md) I should have
preferred to translate âtmânam âtmanâ pa*s*yati by 'he sees his Self by
his Self,' but the commentator takes a slightly different view, and says
itthambhâve t*ri*tîyâ; paramâtmarûpe*n*a pa*s*yati.

<span id="fn_1095"></span>[320:4](sbe15117.htm#fr_1098.md) If we read
sa*m*yo*g*ya we must follow the commentator in translating by 'uniting
the senses with the prâ*n*a and the manas.'

<span id="fn_1096"></span>[320:5](sbe15117.htm#fr_1099.md) Let the Self

<span id="fn_1104"></span>[324:1](sbe15117.htm#fr_1107.md) As the fire
which exists invisibly in a heated vessel becomes visible when the
heated vessel is touched with sticks dipped in butter, thus the Âtman in
the body appears only when the Prâ*n*as are diffused in it. Or, as the
clarified butter, heated together with the vessel, lights up grass that
comes in contact with it, so does this Âtman (called Not-breath), by
heating its two bodies which are pervaded by the reflections of the
thinker, light up everything brought in contact with it, viz. the world.

always there, but it seems then only to appear.

<span id="fn_1108"></span>[324:5](sbe15117.htm#fr_1111.md) The commentator
explains this differently. He says that the <span id="page_325">p.
325</span> similes are intended to show how, as soon as the impediment
is removed, the worshipper obtains his true form, i.e. becomes Brahman.
Afterwards he explains *k*ittam, thought, by the individual thinker, and
declares that he vanishes together with the thought, which forms the
â*s*raya, the place, or the upâdhi, the outward form. Or again, he says
that the *k*itta, the mind, vanishes with its outward sign, viz. the
thoughts and imaginations.

<span id="fn_1114"></span>[327:2](sbe15117.htm#fr_1117.md) I have

<span id="fn_1115"></span>[327:3](sbe15117.htm#fr_1118.md) The passages

similar passages. What is peculiar to Râmatîrtha is that he explains
Upanishad by such passages as we had just now, viz. its Upanishad is
that it is the true of the true. The *S*lokas are, explained as verses
like those in VI, 19, a*k*itta*m* *k*ittamadhyastham. The Sûtras are
explained as comprehensive sentences, such as II, 2, aya*m* vâva khalv

the Sûtra, such as the dialogue between the Vâlakhilyas and Kratu.
