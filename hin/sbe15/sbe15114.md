### THIRD PRAPÂ*TH*AKA.

1\. The Vâlakhilyas said to Pra*g*âpati Kratu: 'O Saint, if thou thus
showest the greatness of that Self, then who is that other different
one, also called Self <span id="fr_979"></span>[4](#fn_976.md), who really
overcome by bright and dark fruits of action, enters on a good or bad
birth?

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Downward or upward
is his course <span id="fr_980"></span>[1](#fn_977.md), and overcome by the
pairs (distinction between hot and cold, pleasure and pain, &c.) he
roams about <span id="fr_981"></span>[2](#fn_978.md).'

2\. Pra*g*âpati Kratu replied: 'There is indeed that other <span
id="fr_982"></span>[3](#fn_979.md) different one, called the elemental Self
(Bhûtâtmâ), who, overcome by bright and dark fruits of action, enters on
a good or bad birth: downward or upward is his course, and overcome by
the pairs he roams about. And this is his explanation: The five
Tanmâtrâs <span id="fr_983"></span>[4](#fn_980.md) (sound, touch, form,
taste, smell) are called Bhûta; also the five Mahâbhûtas (gross
elements) are called Bhûta. Then the aggregate <span
id="fr_984"></span>[5](#fn_981.md) of all these is called *s*arîra,
body <span id="fr_985"></span>[6](#fn_982.md). And lastly he of whom it was
said that he dwelt in the body <span id="fr_986"></span>[7](#fn_983.md), he
is called Bhûtâtmâ, the elemental Self. Thus his immortal Self <span
id="fr_987"></span>[8](#fn_984.md) is like a drop of water on a lotus
leaf <span id="fr_988"></span>[9](#fn_985.md), and he himself is overcome
by the qualities of nature. Then <span id="fr_989"></span>[10](#fn_986.md),
because he is thus overcome, he becomes bewildered, and because he is
bewildered, he saw not the creator, the holy Lord, abiding within
himself. Carried along by the waves of the qualities <span
id="fr_990"></span>[11](#fn_987.md), darkened in his imaginations,
unstable, fickle,

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

crippled, full of desires, vacillating, he enters into belief, believing
"I am he," "this is mine <span id="fr_991"></span>[1](#fn_988.md);" he
binds his Self by his Self, as a bird with a net, and overcome
afterwards by the fruits of what he has done, he enters on a good and
bad birth; downward or upward is his course, and overcome by the pairs
he roams about.'

They asked: 'Which is it?' And he answered them:

3\. 'This also has elsewhere been said: He who acts, is the elemental
Self; he who causes to act by means of the organs <span
id="fr_992"></span>[2](#fn_989), is the inner man (anta*h*purusha.md). Now
as even a ball of iron, pervaded (overcome) by fire, and hammered by
smiths, becomes manifold (assumes different forms, such as crooked,
round, large, small <span id="fr_993"></span>[3](#fn_990).md), thus the
elemental Self, pervaded (overcome) by the inner man, and hammered by
the qualities, becomes manifold <span id="fr_994"></span>[4](#fn_991.md).
And the four tribes (mammals, birds, &c.), the fourteen worlds (Bhûr,
&c.), with all the number of beings, multiplied eighty-four times <span
id="fr_995"></span>[5](#fn_992.md), all this appears as manifoldness. And
those multiplied things are impelled by man (purusha) as the wheel by
the potter <span id="fr_996"></span>[6](#fn_993.md). And as when the ball
of iron is hammered, the fire is not overcome, so the (inner) man is not
overcome, but the elemental Self is overcome, because it has united
itself (with the elements).

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

4\. And it has been said elsewhere <span
id="fr_997"></span>[1](#fn_994.md): This body produced from marriage, and
endowed with growth <span id="fr_998"></span>[2](#fn_995.md) in darkness,
came forth by the urinary passage, was built up with bones, bedaubed
with flesh, thatched with skin, filled with ordure, urine, bile, slime,
marrow, fat, oil <span id="fr_999"></span>[3](#fn_996.md), and many
impurities besides, like a treasury full of treasures <span
id="fr_1000"></span>[4](#fn_997.md).

5\. And it has been said elsewhere: Bewilderment, fear, grief, sleep,
sloth, carelessness, decay, sorrow, hunger, thirst, niggardliness,
wrath, infidelity, ignorance, envy, cruelty <span
id="fr_1001"></span>[5](#fn_998.md), folly, shamelessness, meanness <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[6](#fn_999.md), pride, changeability <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[7](#fn_1000.md), these are the results of the quality
of darkness (tama*h*) <span id="fr_1004"></span>[8](#fn_1001.md).

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

Inward thirst, fondness, passion, covetousness, unkindness, love,
hatred, deceit <span id="fr_1005"></span>[1](sbe15115.htm#fn_1002.md),
jealousy, vain restlessness, fickleness <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[2](sbe15115.htm#fn_1003.md), unstableness, emulation,
greed, patronising of friends, family pride, aversion to disagreeable
objects, devotion to agreeable objects, whispering <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[3](sbe15115.htm#fn_1004.md), prodigality, these are
the results of the quality of passion (ra*g*as).

By these he is filled, by these he is overcome, and therefore this
elemental Self assumes manifold forms, yes, manifold forms.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_976"></span>[295:4](sbe15114.htm#fr_979.md) The pure Self,
called âtmâ, brahma, *k*inmâtram, pra*gñ*ânaghanam, &c., after entering
what he had himself created, and no longer distinguishing himself from
the created things (bhûta), is called Bhûtâtmâ.

<span id="fn_977"></span>[296:1](sbe15114.htm#fr_980.md) M. reads here and
afterwards avâkam ûrdhva*m* vâ gatidvandvai*h*.

<span id="fn_978"></span>[296:2](sbe15114.htm#fr_981.md) M. adds at the
end, paribhramatîti katama esha iti, tân hovâ*k*eti, and leaves it out
at the end of § 2.

<span id="fn_979"></span>[296:3](sbe15114.htm#fr_982.md) M. here reads
avara.

<span id="fn_980"></span>[296:4](sbe15114.htm#fr_983.md) M. reads
tanmâtrâ*n*i.

<span id="fn_981"></span>[296:5](sbe15114.htm#fr_984.md) M. reads teshâ*m*
samudayas ta*kkh*arîram.

<span id="fn_982"></span>[296:6](sbe15114.htm#fr_985.md) The commentator
distinguishes between liṅga-*s*arîra, consisting of prâ*n*as, indriyas,
the anta*h*karana, and the sûkshmabhûtas; and the sthûla-*s*arîra,
consisting of the five Mahâbhûtas.

<span id="fn_983"></span>[296:7](sbe15114.htm#fr_986.md) M. reads *s*arîram
ity uktam.

<span id="fn_984"></span>[296:8](sbe15114.htm#fr_987.md) M. reads athâsti
tasyâ*h* bindur iva.

<span id="fn_985"></span>[296:9](sbe15114.htm#fr_988.md) It sticks to it,
yet it can easily run off again.

<span id="fn_986"></span>[296:10](sbe15114.htm#fr_989.md) M. reads Ato, and
the commentator explains atho by ata*h* kâra*n*ât, adding sandhi*h*
*kh*ândasa*h*.

<span id="fn_987"></span>[296:11](sbe15114.htm#fr_990.md) See VI, 30.

<span id="fn_988"></span>[297:1](sbe15114.htm#fr_991.md) M. reads aha*m* so
mamedam.

<span id="fn_989"></span>[297:2](sbe15114.htm#fr_992.md) M.
anta*h*kara*n*ai*h*.

<span id="fn_990"></span>[297:3](sbe15114.htm#fr_993.md) See commentary, p.
48, l. 7.

<span id="fn_991"></span>[297:4](sbe15114.htm#fr_994.md) AI. reads upety
atha trigu*n*a*m* *k*atur*g*âlam.

<span id="fn_992"></span>[297:5](sbe15114.htm#fr_995.md) M. reads
*k*atura*s*îtilakshayonipari*n*atam. See also Anubhûtiprakâ*s*a, ver.
118.

<span id="fn_993"></span>[297:6](sbe15114.htm#fr_996.md) M*ri*tyava seems
an impossible word, though the commentator twice explains it as kulâla,
potter. M. reads *k*akri*n*eti, which seems preferable. Weber
conjectures m*ri*tpa*k*a.

<span id="fn_994"></span>[298:1](sbe15114.htm#fr_997.md) Part of this
passage has been before the mind of the author of the
Mânava-dharma*s*âstra, when writing, VI, 76, 77: asthisthû*n*a*m*
snâyuyutam mâ*m*sa*s*o*n*italepanam, *k*armâvanaddha*m* durgandhi
pûr*n*am mûtrapurîshayo*h*, *g*arâ*s*okasamâvish*t*a*m* rogâyatanam
âturam ra*g*asvalam anitya*m* *k*a bhâtâvâsam ima*m* tya*g*et. The same
verses occur in the Mahâbhârata XII, 12463-4, only with tya*g*a at the
end, instead of tya*g*et. The rendering of asthibhi*s* *k*itam by
asthisthû*n*am shows that *k*ita was understood to mean piled or built
up, i.e. supported by bones.

<span id="fn_995"></span>[298:2](sbe15114.htm#fr_998.md) Instead of
sa*m*v*ri*ddhyupetam M. reads sa*m*viddhyapetam.

<span id="fn_996"></span>[298:3](sbe15114.htm#fr_999.md) M. adds snâyu
after vasâ, and instead of âmayai*h* reads malai*h*. This reading,
malai*h*, would seem preferable, though Manu's rogâyatanam might be
quoted in support of âmayai*h*. The exact meaning of vasâ is given in
the Âryavidyâsudhâkara, p. 82, l. 9.

<span id="fn_997"></span>[298:4](sbe15114.htm#fr_1000.md) Therefore should
wise people not identify their true Self with the body. M. reads
vasuneti.

<span id="fn_998"></span>[298:5](sbe15114.htm#fr_1001.md) M. reads
vaikâru*n*yam.

<span id="fn_999"></span>[298:6](sbe15114.htm#fr_1002.md) Instead of
nirâk*ri*tityam M. reads nik*ri*tatvam, which is decidedly preferable.
We may take it to mean either meanness, as opposed to uddhatatvam,
overbearing, or knavery, the usual meaning of nik*ri*ti.

<span id="fn_1000"></span>[298:7](sbe15114.htm#fr_1003.md) M. reads
asatvam, possibly for asattvam.

<span id="fn_1001"></span>[298:8](sbe15114.htm#fr_1004.md) M. reads
tâmasânvitai*h*, and afterwards râ*g*asânvitai*h*; also t*ri*shnâ
instead of antast*ri*shnâ.
