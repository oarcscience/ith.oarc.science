### EIGHTH ANUVÂKA.

Let him never shun food, that is the rule. Water is food, the light eats
the food. The light rests on water, water rests on light. This is the
food resting

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

on food <span id="fr_240"></span>[1](#fn_240). He who knows this food
resting on food, rests exalted, becomes rich in food, and able to eat
food (healthy), becomes great by offspring, cattle, and the splendour of
his knowledge (of Brahman), great by fame.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_237"></span>[66:1](sbe15048.htm#fr_237) Taught by Varu*n*a,
learnt by Bh*ri*gu Vâru*n*i.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[66:2](sbe15049.htm#fr_238) Because, like food,
it is inside the body.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[66:3](sbe15049.htm#fr_239) The interdependence
of food and breath. The object of this discussion is to show (see
*S*aṅkara's commentary, p. 135) that the world owes its origin to there
being an enjoyer (subject) and what is enjoyed (object), but that this
distinction does not exist in the Self.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[67:1](sbe15050.htm#fr_240) The interdependence
of water and light.
