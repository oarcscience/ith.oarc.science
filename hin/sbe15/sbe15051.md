### NINTH ANUVÂKA.

Let him acquire much food, that is the rule. Earth is food, the ether
eats the food. The ether rests on the earth, the earth rests on the
ether. This is the food resting on food. He who knows this food resting
on food, rests exalted, becomes rich in food, and able to eat food
(healthy), becomes great by offspring, cattle, and the splendour of his
knowledge (of Brahman), great by fame.
