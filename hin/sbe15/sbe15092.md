### FOURTEENTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

1\. The words Bhûmi (earth), Antariksha (sky), and Dyu <span
id="fr_573"></span>[1](#fn_573) (heaven) form eight syllables. One foot
of the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables. This (one foot) of it is
that (i. e. the three worlds). And he who thus knows that foot of it,
conquers as far as the three worlds extend.

2\. The *Ri*kas, the Ya*g*û*m*shi, and the Sâmâni form eight syllables.
One foot (the second) of the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables. This
(one foot) of it is that (i.e. the three Vedas, the *Ri*g-veda,
Ya*g*ur-veda, and Sama-veda). And he who thus knows that foot of it,
conquers as far as that threefold knowledge extends.

3\. The Prâ*n*a (the up-breathing), the Apâna (the down-breathing), and
the Vyâna (the back-breathing) form eight syllables. One foot (the
third) of the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables. This (one foot) of it
is that (i. e. the three vital breaths). And he who thus knows that foot
of it, conquers as far as there is anything that breathes. And of that
(Gâyatrî, or speech) this indeed is the fourth (turîya), the bright
(dar*s*ata) foot, shining high above the skies <span
id="fr_574"></span>[2](#fn_574). What is here called turîya (the fourth)
is meant for *k*aturtha (the fourth); what is called dar*s*atam padam
(the bright foot) is meant for him who is as it were seen (the person in
the sun); and what is called parora*g*as (he who shines high above the

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

skies) is meant for him who shines higher and higher above every sky.
And he who thus knows that foot of the Gâyatrî, shines thus himself also
with happiness and glory.

4\. That Gâyatrî (as described before with its three feet) rests on that
fourth foot, the bright one, high above the sky. And that again rests on
the True (satyam), and the True is the eye, for the eye is (known to be)
true. And therefore even now, if two persons come disputing, the one
saying, I saw, the other, I heard, then we should trust the one who
says, I saw. And the True again rests on force (balam), and force is
life (prâ*n*a), and that (the True) rests on life <span
id="fr_575"></span>[1](#fn_575). Therefore they say, force is stronger
than the True. Thus does that Gâyatrî rest with respect to the self (as
life). That Gâyatrî protects (tatre) the vital breaths (gayas); the
gayas are the prâ*n*as (vital breaths), and it protects them. And
because it protects (tatre) the vital breaths (gayas), therefore it is
called Gâyatrî. And that Savit*ri* verse which the teacher teaches <span
id="fr_576"></span>[2](#fn_576), that is it (the life, the prâ*n*a, and
indirectly the Gâyatrî); and whomsoever he teaches, he protects his
vital breaths.

5\. Some teach that Sâvitrî as an Anush*t*ubh <span
id="fr_577"></span>[3](#fn_577) verse, saying that speech is
Anush*t*ubh, and that we teach

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

that speech. Let no one do this, but let him teach the Gâyatrî as
Sâvitrî <span id="fr_578"></span>[1](#fn_578). And even if one who knows
this receives what seems to be much as his reward (as a teacher), yet
this is not equal to one foot of the Gâyatrî.

6\. If a man (a teacher) were to receive as his fee these three worlds
full of all things, he would obtain that first foot of the Gâyatrî. And
if a man were to receive as his fee everything as far as this threefold
knowledge extends, he would obtain that second foot of the Gâyatrî. And
if a man were to receive as his fee everything whatsoever breathes, he
would obtain that third foot of the Gâyatrî. But 'that fourth bright
foot, shining high above the skies <span
id="fr_579"></span>[2](#fn_579)' cannot be obtained by anybody--whence
then could one receive such a fee?

7\. The adoration <span id="fr_580"></span>[3](#fn_580) of that
(Gâyatrî):

'O Gâyatrî, thou hast one foot, two feet, three feet, four feet <span
id="fr_581"></span>[4](#fn_581). Thou art footless, for thou art not
known. Worship to thy fourth bright foot above the skies.' If <span
id="fr_582"></span>[5](#fn_582) one (who knows this) hates some

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

one and says, 'May he not obtain this,' or 'May this wish not be
accomplished to him,' then that wish is not accomplished to him against
whom he thus prays, or if he says, 'May I obtain this.'

8\. And thus *G*anaka Vaideha spoke on this point to Bu*d*ila
Â*s*vatarâ*s*vi <span id="fr_583"></span>[1](#fn_583): 'How is it that
thou who spokest thus as knowing the Gâyatrî, hast become an elephant
and carriest me?' He answered: 'Your Majesty, I did not know its mouth.
Agni, fire, is indeed its mouth; and if people pile even what seems much
(wood) on the fire, it consumes it all. And thus a man who knows this,
even if he commits what seems much evil, consumes it all and becomes
pure, clean, and free from decay and death.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_573"></span>[196:1](sbe15092.htm#fr_573) Dyu, nom. Dyaus,
must be pronounced Diyaus.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[196:2](sbe15092.htm#fr_574) Parona*g*as,
masc., should be taken as one word, like paroksha, viz. he who is beyond
all ragas, all visible skies.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[197:1](sbe15092.htm#fr_575) *S*aṅkara
understood the True (satyam) by tad, not the balam, the force.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[197:2](sbe15092.htm#fr_576) The teacher
teaches his pupil, who is brought to him when eight years old, the
Sâvitrî verse, making him repeat each word, and each half verse, till he
knows the whole, and by teaching him that Sâvitrî, he is supposed to
teach him really the prâ*n*a, the life, as the self of the world.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[197:3](sbe15092.htm#fr_577) The verse would
be, *Ri*g-veda V, 82, 1:

Tat savitur v*rin*îmahe vaya*m* devasya bho*g*anam  
*S*resh*th*am sarvadhâtama*m* turam bhagasya dhîmahi.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[198:1](sbe15092.htm#fr_578) Because Gâyatrî
represents life, and the pupil receives life when be learns the Gâyatrî.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[198:2](sbe15092.htm#fr_579) See before, § 2.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[198:3](sbe15092.htm#fr_580) Upasthâna is the
act of approaching the gods, προσκύνησις Angehen, with a view of
obtaining a request. Here the application is of two kinds, abhi*k*ârika,
imprecatory against another, and abhyudayika, auspicious for oneself.
The former has two formulas, the latter one. An upasthâna is here
represented as effective, if connected with the Gâyatrî.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[198:4](sbe15092.htm#fr_581) Consisting of the
three worlds, the threefold knowledge, the threefold vital breaths, and
the fourth foot, as described before.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[198:5](sbe15092.htm#fr_582) I have translated
this paragraph very freely, and differently from *S*aṅkara. The question
is, whether dvishyât with iti can be used in the sense of abhi*k*âra, or
imprecation. if not, I do not see how the words should be construed. The
expression yasmâ upatish*th*ate <span id="page_199">p. 199</span> is
rightly explained by Dvivedagaṅga, yadartham evam upatish*th*ate.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[199:1](sbe15092.htm#fr_583)
A*s*vatarasyâ*s*vasyâpatyam, *S*aṅkara.
