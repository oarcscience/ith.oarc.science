### FIFTH QUESTION.

1\. Then *S*aivya Satyakâma asked him:--'Sir, if some one among men
should meditate here until death on the syllable Om, what would he
obtain by it?'

2\. He replied: 'O Satyakâma, the syllable Om (AUM) is the highest and
also the other Brahman;

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

therefore he who knows it arrives by the same means <span
id="fr_911"></span>[1](#fn_908) at one of the two.

3\. If he meditate on one Mâtrâ (the A) <span
id="fr_912"></span>[2](#fn_909), then, being enlightened by that only,
he arrives quickly at the earth <span id="fr_913"></span>[3](#fn_910).
The *Rik*-verses lead him to the world of men, and being endowed there
with penance, abstinence, and faith, he enjoys greatness.

4\. If he meditate with <span id="fr_914"></span>[4](#fn_911) two Mâtrâs
(A + U) he arrives at the Manas <span id="fr_915"></span>[5](#fn_912),
and is led up by the Ya*g*us-verses to the sky, to the Soma-world.
Having enjoyed greatness in the Soma-world, he returns again.

5\. Again, he who meditates with this syllable AUM of three Mâtrâs, on
the Highest Person, he comes to light and to the sun. And as a snake is
freed from its skin, so is he freed from evil. He is led up by the
Sâman-verses to the Brahma-world <span id="fr_916"></span>[6](#fn_913);
and from him, full of life (Hira*n*yagarbha, the lord of the
Satya-loka <span id="fr_917"></span>[7](#fn_914)), he learns <span
id="fr_918"></span>[8](#fn_915) to see the all-pervading, the Highest
Person. And there are these two *S*lokas:

6\. The three Mâtrâs (A + U + M), if employed separate, and only joined
one to another, are mortal <span id="fr_919"></span>[9](#fn_916);

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

but in acts, external, internal, or intermediate, if well performed, the
sage trembles not <span id="fr_920"></span>[1](#fn_917).

7\. Through the *Rik*-verses he arrives at this world, through the
Ya*g*us-verses at the sky, through the Sâman-verses at that which the
poets teach,--he arrives at this by means of the Oṅkâra; the wise
arrives at that which is at rest, free from decay, from death, from
fear,--the Highest.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_908"></span>[282:1](sbe15110.htm#fr_911) Âyatanena,
âlambanena.

<span id="fn_909"></span>[282:2](sbe15110.htm#fr_912) Dîpikâyâ*m*
Vâ*k*aspatinaivâkâramâtram ityeva vyâkhyâtam.

<span id="fn_910"></span>[282:3](sbe15110.htm#fr_913) Sampadyate
prâpnoti *g*anmeti *s*esha*h*.

<span id="fn_911"></span>[282:4](sbe15110.htm#fr_914) *S*rutau t*ri*tîyâ
dvitîyârthe.

<span id="fn_912"></span>[282:5](sbe15110.htm#fr_915) Literally the
mind, but here meant for the moon, as before. It is clear that manasi
belongs to sampadyate, not, as the Dîpikâ and Roer think, to dhyâyîta.
Some take it for svapnâbhimânî Hira*n*yagarbha*h*.

<span id="fn_913"></span>[282:6](sbe15110.htm#fr_916) The world of
Hira*n*yagarbha*h*, called the Satyaloka.

<span id="fn_914"></span>[282:7](sbe15110.htm#fr_917) On a later
addition, bringing in the Om as consisting of three Mâtrâs and a half,
see Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 453; Roer, p. 238.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[282:8](sbe15110.htm#fr_918) Tadupade*s*eneti
yâvat.

<span id="fn_916"></span>[282:9](sbe15110.htm#fr_919) Because in their
separate form, A, U, M, they do not mean the Highest Brahman.

<span id="fn_917"></span>[283:1](sbe15110.htm#fr_920) The three acts are
explained as waking, slumbering, and deep sleep; or as three kinds of
pronunciation, târa-mandra-madhyama. They are probably meant for Yoga
exercises in which the three Mâtrâs of Om are used as one word, and as
an emblem of the Highest Brahman.
