### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_391.md).

1\. Then *G*âratkârava Ârtabhâga <span id="fr_392"></span>[2](#fn_392.md)
asked. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'how many Grahas are there, and how
many Atigrahas <span id="fr_393"></span>[3](#fn_393.md)?'

'Eight Grahas,' he replied,' and eight Atigrahas.'

'And what are these eight Grahas and eight Atigrahas?'

2\. 'Prâ*n*a (breath) is one Graha, and that is seized by Apâna
(down-breathing) as the Atigrâha <span id="fr_394"></span>[4](#fn_394.md),
for one smells with the Apâna.'

3\. 'Speech (vâ*k*) is one Graha, and that is seized by name (nâman) as
the Atigrâha, for with speech one pronounces names.

4\. 'The tongue is one Graha, and that is seized by taste as the
Atigrâha, for with the tongue one perceives tastes.'

5\. 'The eye is one Graha, and that is seized by form as the Atigrâha,
for with the eye one sees forms.'

6\. 'The ear is one Graha, and that is seized by sound as the Atigrâha,
for with the ear one hears sounds.'

7\. 'The mind is one Graha, and that is seized by

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

desire as the Atigrâha, for with the mind one desires desires.'

8\. 'The arms are one Graha, and these are seized by work as the
Atigrâha, for with the arms one works work.'

9\. 'The skin is one Graha, and that is seized by touch as the Atigrâha,
for with the skin one perceives touch. These are the eight Grahas and
the eight Atigrahas.'

10\. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'everything is the food of death. What
then is the deity to whom death is food?'

'Fire (agni) is death, and that is the food of water. Death is conquered
again.'

11\. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'when such a person (a sage) dies, do the
vital breaths (prâ*n*as) move out of him or no?'

'No,' replied Yâ*gñ*avalkya; 'they are gathered up in him, he swells, he
is inflated, and thus inflated the dead lies at rest.'

12\. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'when such a man dies, what does not
leave him?'

'The name,' he replied; 'for the name is endless, the Vi*s*vedevas are
endless, and by it he gains the endless world.'

13\. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said,' when the speech of this dead person
enters into the fire <span id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_395.md), breath into
the air, the eye into the sun, the mind into the moon, the hearing into
space, into the earth the body, into the ether the self, into the shrubs
the hairs of the body, into the trees the hairs of the head, when the

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

blood and the seed are deposited in the water, where is then that
person?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'Take my hand, my friend. We two alone shall know of
this; let this question of ours not be (discussed) in public.' Then
these two went out and argued, and what they said was karman (work),
what they praised was karman <span id="fr_396"></span>[1](#fn_396.md), viz.
that a man becomes good by good work, and bad by bad work. After that
*G*âratkârava Ârtabhâga held his peace.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_391"></span>[125:1](sbe15065.htm#fr_391.md) Mâdhyandina text,
p. 1069.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[125:2](sbe15065.htm#fr_392.md) A descendant of
*Ri*tabhâga of the family of *G*aratkâru.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[125:3](sbe15065.htm#fr_393.md) Graha is probably
meant originally in its usual sacrificial sense, as a vessel for
offering oblations. But its secondary meaning, in which it is here
taken, is a taker, a grasper, i.e. an organ of sense, while atigraha is
intended for that which is grasped, i.e. an object of sense.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[125:4](sbe15065.htm#fr_394.md) Here the â is
long, *kh*ândasatvât.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[126:1](sbe15065.htm#fr_395.md) The commentator
explains purusha here by asamyagdar*s*in, one who does not know the
whole truth. See also Deussen, Vedânta, p. 405, and p. 399, note.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[127:1](sbe15065.htm#fr_396.md) What is intended
is that the sa*m*sâra continues by means of karman, while karman by
itself never leads to moksha.
