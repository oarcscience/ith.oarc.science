### FOURTH ADHYÂYA.

1\. He, the sun, without any colour, who with set purpose <span
id="fr_780"></span>[1](#fn_778) by means of his power (*s*akti.md) produces
endless colours <span id="fr_781"></span>[2](#fn_779.md), in whom all this
comes together in the beginning, and comes asunder in the end--may he,
the god, endow us with good thoughts <span
id="fr_782"></span>[3](#fn_780.md).

2\. That (Self) indeed is Agni (fire), it is Âditya (sun), it is Vâyu
(wind), it is *K*andramas (moon); the same also is the starry
firmament <span id="fr_783"></span>[4](#fn_781.md), it is Brahman
(Hira*n*yagarbha), it is water, it is Pra*g*âpati (Virâ*g*).

3\. Thou art woman, thou art man; thou art youth, thou art maiden; thou,
as an old man, totterest <span id="fr_784"></span>[5](#fn_782.md) along on
thy staff; thou art born with thy face turned everywhere.

4\. Thou art the dark-blue bee, thou art the green

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

parrot with red eyes, thou art the thunder-cloud, the seasons, the seas.
Thou art without beginning <span id="fr_785"></span>[1](#fn_783.md),
because thou art infinite, thou from whom all worlds are born.

5 <span id="fr_786"></span>[2](#fn_784.md). There is one unborn being
(female), red, white, and black, uniform, but producing manifold
offspring. There is one unborn being (male) who loves her and lies by
her; there is another who leaves her, while she is eating what has to be
eaten.

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

6 <span id="fr_787"></span>[1](#fn_785.md). Two birds, inseparable friends,
cling to the same tree. One of them eats the sweet fruit, the other
looks on without eating.

7\. On the same tree man sits grieving, immersed, bewildered, by his own
impotence (an-î*s*â). But when he sees the other lord (î*s*a) contented,
and knows his glory, then his grief passes away.

8 <span id="fr_788"></span>[2](#fn_786.md). He who does not know that
indestructible being of the *Ri*g-Veda, that highest ether-like (Self)
wherein all the gods reside, of what use is the *Ri*g-Veda to him? Those
only who know it, rest contented.

9\. That from which the maker (mâyin <span
id="fr_789"></span>[3](#fn_787).md) sends forth all this--the sacred
verses, the offerings, the sacrifices, the panaceas, the past, the
future, and all

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

that the Vedas declare--in that the other is bound up through that mâyâ.

10\. Know then Prak*ri*ti (nature) is Mâyâ (art), and the great Lord the
Mâyin (maker); the whole world is filled with what are his members.

11\. If a man has discerned him, who being one only, rules over every
germ (cause), in whom all this comes together and comes asunder again,
who is the lord, the bestower of blessing, the adorable god, then he
passes for ever into that peace.

12 <span id="fr_790"></span>[1](#fn_788.md). He, the creator and supporter
of the gods, Rudra, the great seer, the lord of all, who saw <span
id="fr_791"></span>[2](#fn_789.md), Hira*n*yagarbha being born, may he
endow us with good thoughts.

13\. He who is the sovereign of the gods, he in whom all the
worlds <span id="fr_792"></span>[3](#fn_790.md) rest, he who rules over all
two-footed and four-footed beings, to that god <span
id="fr_793"></span>[4](#fn_791.md) let us sacrifice an oblation.

14\. He who has known him who is more subtile than subtile, in the midst
of chaos, creating all things, having many forms, alone enveloping
everything <span id="fr_794"></span>[5](#fn_792.md), the happy one
(*S*iva), passes into peace for ever.

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

15\. He also was in time <span id="fr_795"></span>[1](#fn_793.md) the
guardian of this world, the lord of all, hidden in all beings. In him
the Brahmarshis and the deities are united <span
id="fr_796"></span>[2](#fn_794.md), and he who knows him cuts the fetters
of death asunder.

16\. He who knows *S*iva (the blessed) hidden in all beings, like the
subtile film that rises from out the clarified butter <span
id="fr_797"></span>[3](#fn_795.md), alone enveloping everything,--he who
knows the god, is freed from all fetters.

17\. That god, the maker of all things, the great Self <span
id="fr_798"></span>[4](#fn_796.md), always dwelling in the heart of man, is
perceived by the heart, the soul, the mind <span
id="fr_799"></span>[5](#fn_797.md);--they who know it become immortal.

18\. When the light has risen <span id="fr_800"></span>[6](#fn_798.md),
there is no day, no night, neither existence nor non-existence <span
id="fr_801"></span>[7](#fn_799); *S*iva (the blessed.md) alone is there.
That is the eternal, the adorable light of Savit*ri* <span
id="fr_802"></span>[8](#fn_800.md),--and the ancient wisdom proceeded
thence.

19\. No one has grasped him above, or across, or in the middle <span
id="fr_803"></span>[9](#fn_801.md). There is no image of him whose name is
Great Glory.

20\. His form cannot be seen, no one perceives him with the eye.
Those <span id="fr_804"></span>[10](#fn_802.md) who through heart and

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

mind know him thus abiding in the heart, become immortal.

21\. 'Thou art unborn,' with these words some one comes near to thee,
trembling. O Rudra, let thy gracious <span
id="fr_805"></span>[1](#fn_803.md) face protect me for ever!

22 <span id="fr_806"></span>[2](#fn_804.md). O Rudra! hurt us not in our
offspring and descendants, hurt us not in our own lives, nor in our
cows, nor in our horses! Do not slay our men in thy wrath, for, holding
oblations, we call on thee always.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_778"></span>[249:1](sbe15103.htm#fr_780.md) Nihitârtha,
explained by *S*aṅkara as g*ri*hîtaprayo*g*ana*h* svârthanirapeksha*h*.
This may mean with set purpose, but if we read ag*ri*hîtaprayo*g*ana*h*
it would mean the contrary, namely, without any definite object,
irrespective of his own objects. This is possible, and perhaps more in
accordance with the idea of creation as propounded by those to whom the
devâtma*s*akti is mâyâ. Nihita would then mean hidden.

<span id="fn_779"></span>[249:2](sbe15103.htm#fr_781.md) Colour is intended
for qualities, differences, &c.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[249:3](sbe15103.htm#fr_782.md) This verse has
been translated very freely. As it stands, vi *k*aiti *k*ânte vi*s*vam
âdau sa deva*h*, it does not construe, in spite of all attempts to the
contrary, made by *S*aṅkara. What is intended is yasminn ida*m* sa*m*
*k*a vi *k*aiti sarvam (IV, 11); but how so simple a line should have
been changed into what we read now, is difficult to say.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[249:4](sbe15103.htm#fr_783.md) This is the
explanation of *S*aṅkara, and probably that of the Yoga schools in India
at his time. But to take *s*ukram for dîptiman nakshatrâdi, brahma for
Hira*n*yagarbha, and Pra*g*âpati for Virâ*g* seems suggested by this
verse only.

<span id="fn_782"></span>[249:5](sbe15103.htm#fr_784.md) Va*ñk*ayasi, an
exceptional form, instead of va*ñk*asi (A. B.)

<span id="fn_783"></span>[250:1](sbe15103.htm#fr_785.md) We see throughout
the constant change from the masculine to the neuter gender, in
addressing either the lord or his true essence.

<span id="fn_784"></span>[250:2](sbe15103.htm#fr_786.md) This is again one
of the famous verses of our Upanishad, because it formed for a long time
a bone of contention between Vedânta and Sâṅkhya philosophers. The
Sâṅkhyas admit two principles, the Purusha, the absolute subject, and
the Prak*ri*ti, generally translated by nature. The Vedanta philosophers
admit nothing but the one absolute subject, and look upon nature as due
to a power inherent in that subject. The later Sâṅkhyas therefore, who
are as anxious as the Vedântins to find authoritative passages in the
Veda, confirming their opinions, appeal to this and other passages, to
show that their view of Prak*ri*ti, as an independent power, is
supported by the Veda. The whole question is fully discussed in the
Vedânta-sûtras I, 4, 8. Here we read rohita-k*ri*sh*n*a-*s*uklâm, which
seems preferable to lohita-k*ri*sh*n*a-var*n*âm, at least from a Vedânta
point of view, for the three colours, red, black, and white, are
explained as signifying either the three gunas, ra*g*as, sattva, and
tamas, or better (*Kh*ând. Up. VI, 3, 1), the three elements, te*g*as
(fire), ap (water), and anna (earth). A. reads
rohita*s*uklak*ri*sh*n*âm; B. lohita*s*uklakrish*n*â (sic). We also find
in A. and B. bhuktabhogâm for bhuktabhogyâm, but the latter seems
technically the more correct reading. It would be quite wrong to imagine
that a*g*a and a*g*â are meant here for he-goat and she-goat. These
words, in the sense of unborn, are recognised as early as the hymns of
the *Ri*g-veda, and they occurred in our Upanishad I, 9, where the two
a*g*as are mentioned in the same sense as here. But there is, no doubt,
a play on the words, and the poet wished to convey the second meaning of
he-goat and she-goat, only not as the primary, but as the secondary
intention.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[251:1](sbe15103.htm#fr_787.md) The same verses
occur in the Mundaka Up. III, 1.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[251:2](sbe15103.htm#fr_788.md) It is difficult to
see how this verse comes in here. In the Taitt. Âr. II, 11, 6, it is
quoted in connection with the syllable Om, the Akshara, in which all the
Vedas are comprehended. It is similarly used in the
N*ri*si*m*ha-pûrva-tâpanî, IV, 2; V, 2. In our passage, however, akshara
is referred by *S*aṅkara to the paramâtman, and I have translated it
accordingly. *Rik*a*h* is explained as a genitive singular, but it may
also be taken as a nom. plur., and in that case both the verses of the
Veda and the gods are said to reside in the Akshara, whether we take it
for the Paramâtman or for the Om. In the latter case, parame vyoman is
explained by utk*ri*sh*t*e and rakshake.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[251:3](sbe15103.htm#fr_789.md) it is impossible
to find terms corresponding to mâyâ and mâyin. Mâyâ means making, or
art, but as all making or creating, so far as the Supreme Self is
concerned, is phenomenal only or mere illusion, mâyâ conveys at the same
time the sense of illusion. In the same manner mâyin is the maker, the
artist, but also the magician or juggler. What seems intended by our
verse is that from the akshara which corresponds to brahman, all
proceeds, whatever exists or seems to exist, but that the actual creator
or the author of all emanations is Î*s*a, the Lord, who, as creator, is
acting through mâyâ or devâtma*s*akti. Possibly, however, anya, the
other, may be meant for the individual purusha.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[252:1](sbe15103.htm#fr_790.md) See before, III,
4.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[252:2](sbe15103.htm#fr_791.md) *S*aṅkara does not
explain this verse again, though it differs from III, 4. Vi*gñ*ânâtman
explains pa*s*yata by apa*s*yata, and qualifies the Âtmanepada as
irregular.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[252:3](sbe15103.htm#fr_792.md) B. reads yasmin
devâ*h*, not A.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[252:4](sbe15103.htm#fr_793.md) I read tasmai
instead of kasmai, a various reading mentioned by Vi*gñ*ânâtman. It was
easy to change tasmai into kasmai, because of the well-known line in the
*Ri*g-veda, kasmai devâya havishâ vidhema. Those who read kasmai,
explain it as a dative of Ka, a name of Pra*g*âpati, which in the dative
should be kâya, and not kasmai. It would be better to take kasmai as the
dative of the interrogative pronoun. See M. M., History of Ancient
Sanskrit Literature, p. 433; and Vitâna-sutras IV, 22.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[252:5](sbe15103.htm#fr_794.md) Cf. III, 7.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[253:1](sbe15103.htm#fr_795.md) In former ages,
*S*aṅkara.

<span id="fn_794"></span>[253:2](sbe15103.htm#fr_796.md) Because both the
Brahmarshis, the holy seers, and the deities find their true essence in
Brahman.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[253:3](sbe15103.htm#fr_797.md) We should say,
like cream from milk.

<span id="fn_796"></span>[253:4](sbe15103.htm#fr_798.md) Or the
high-minded.

<span id="fn_797"></span>[253:5](sbe15103.htm#fr_799.md) See III, 13.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[253:6](sbe15103.htm#fr_800.md) Atamas, no
darkness, i.e. light of knowledge.

<span id="fn_799"></span>[253:7](sbe15103.htm#fr_801.md) See on the
difficulty of translating sat and asat, τὸ ὄν and τὸ μή ὄν, the remarks
in the Preface.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[253:8](sbe15103.htm#fr_802.md) Referring to the
Gâyatrî, *Ri*g-veda III, 62, 10; see also *S*vet. Up. V, 4.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[253:9](sbe15103.htm#fr_803.md) See Muir, Metrical
Translations, p. 198; Maitr. Up. VI, 17.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[253:10](sbe15103.htm#fr_804.md) B. reads h*ri*dâ
manîshâ manasâbhik*li*pto, yat tad vidur; A. h*ri*di h*ri*distham
manasâya enam eva*m* vidur.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[254:1](sbe15103.htm#fr_805.md) Dakshina is
explained either as invigorating, exhilarating, or turned towards the
south.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[254:2](sbe15103.htm#fr_806.md) See Colebrooke,
Miscellaneous Essays, I, p. 141; *Ri*g-veda I, 114, 8; Taitt. Sa*m*h.
IV, 5, 10, 3; Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XVI, 16. The various readings are curious.
Âyushi in the *S*vet. Up., instead of âyau in the *Ri*g-veda, is
supported by the Taitt. Sa*m*h. and the Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h.; but
Vi*gñ*ânâtman reads âyau. As to bhâmito, it seems the right reading,
being supported by the *Ri*g-veda, the Taitt. Sa*m*h., and the *S*vet.
Up., while bhâvito in Roer's edition is a misprint. The Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h.
alone reads bhâmino, which Mahîdhara refers to virân. The last verse in
the *Ri*g-veda and Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. is havishmanta*h* sadam it tvâ
havâmahe; in the Taitt. Sa*m*h. havishmanto namasâ vidhema te. In the
*S*vet. Up. havishmantah sadasi tvâ havâmahe, as printed by Roer, seems
to rest on *S*aṅkara's authority only. The other commentators,
*S*aṅkarânanda and Vi*gñ*ânâtman, read and interpret sadam it.
