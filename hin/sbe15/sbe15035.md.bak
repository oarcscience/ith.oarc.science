### SECOND ANUVÂKA.

'From food <span id="fr_215"></span>[2](#fn_215.md) are produced all
creatures which dwell on earth. Then they live by food, and in the end
they return to food. For food is the oldest of all beings, and therefore
it is called panacea (sarvaushadha, i.e. consisting of all herbs, or
quieting the heat of the body of all beings).'

They who worship food as Brahman <span id="fr_216"></span>[3](#fn_216.md),
obtain all food. For food is the oldest of all beings, and therefore it
is called panacea. From food all creatures are produced; by food, when
born, they grow. Because it is fed on, or because it feeds on beings,
therefore it is called food (anna).

Different from this, which consists of the essence of food, is the
other, the inner Self, which consists of breath. The former is filled by
this. It also has the shape of man. Like the human shape of the former
is the human shape of the latter. Prâ*n*a (up-breathing) is its head.
Vyâna (back-breathing) is its right arm. Apâna (down-breathing) is its
left arm. Ether is its trunk. The earth the seat (the support).

On this there is also the following *S*loka:

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_214"></span>[55:1](sbe15034.htm#fr_214.md) The text has 'the
tail, which is his support.' But pratish*th*â seems to have been added,
the Anuvâka ending originally with pu*kkh*a, which is explained by
nâbher adhastâd yad aṅgam. In the Persian translation the different
members are taken for members of a bird, which is not unlikely.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[55:2](sbe15035.htm#fr_215.md) Anna is sometimes
used in the more general sense of matter.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[55:3](sbe15035.htm#fr_216.md) Worship consisting
in the knowledge that they are born of food, live by food, and end in
food, which food is Brahman.
