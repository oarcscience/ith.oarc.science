<p>1. Death said: 'The good is one thing, the pleasant another; these two, having different objects, chain a man. It is well with him who clings to the good; he who chooses the pleasant, misses his end.'</p>  
<p>2. 'The good and the pleasant approach man: the wise goes round about them and distinguishes them. Yea, the wise prefers the good to the pleasant, but the fool chooses the pleasant through greed and avarice.'</p>  
<p>3. 'Thou, O Na<I>k</I>iketas, after pondering all pleasures that are or seem delightful, hast dismissed them all. Thou hast not gone into the road&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that leadeth to wealth, in which many men perish.'</p>  
<p>4. 'Wide apart and leading to different points are these two, ignorance, and what is known as wisdom. I believe Na<I>k</I>iketas to be one who desires knowledge, for even many pleasures did not tear thee away&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>5. 'Fools dwelling in darkness, wise in their own conceit, and puffed up with vain knowledge, go round and round, staggering to and fro, like blind men led by the blind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>6. 'The Hereafter never rises before the eyes of the careless child, deluded by the delusion of wealth. "This is the world," he thinks, "there is no other;"--thus he falls again and again under my sway.'</p>  
<p>7. 'He (the Self) of whom many are not even able</p>

<p>to hear, whom many, even when they hear of him, do not comprehend; wonderful is a man, when found, who is able to teach him (the Self); wonderful is he who comprehends him, when taught by an able teacher&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>8. 'That (Self), when taught by an inferior man, is not easy to be known, even though often thought upon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; unless it be taught by another, there is no way to it, for it is inconceivably smaller than what is small&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>9. 'That doctrine is not to be obtained&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> by argument, but when it is declared by another, then, O dearest, it is easy to understand. Thou hast obtained it now&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; thou art truly a man of true resolve. May we have always an inquirer like thee&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>!'</p>  
<p>10. Na<I>k</I>iketas said: 'I know that what is called a treasure is transient, for that eternal is not obtained by things which are not eternal. Hence the N&acirc;kiketa fire(-sacrifice) has been laid by me (first); then, by means of transient things, I have obtained what is not transient (the teaching of Yama)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>11. Yama said: 'Though thou hadst seen the fulfilment of all desires, the foundation of the world, the endless rewards of good deeds, the shore where</p>

<p>there is no fear, that which is magnified by praise, the wide abode, the rest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, yet being wise thou hast with firm resolve dismissed it all.'</p>  
<p>12. 'The wise who, by means of meditation on his Self, recognises the Ancient, who is difficult to be seen, who has entered into the dark, who is hidden in the cave, who dwells in the abyss, as God, he indeed leaves joy and sorrow far behind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>13. 'A mortal who has heard this and embraced it, who has separated from it all qualities, and has thus reached the subtle Being, rejoices, because he has obtained what is a cause for rejoicing. The house (of Brahman) is open, I believe, O Na<I>k</I>iketas.'</p>  
<p>14. Na<I>k</I>iketas said: 'That which thou seest as neither this nor that, as neither effect nor cause, as neither past nor future, tell me that.'</p>  
<p>15. Yama said: 'That word (or place) which all the Vedas record, which all penances proclaim, which men desire when they live as religious students, that word I tell thee briefly, it is Om&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>16. 'That (imperishable) syllable means Brahman, that syllable means the highest (Brahman); he who knows that syllable, whatever he desires, is his.'</p>  
<p>17. 'This is the best support, this is the highest support; he who knows that support is magnified in the world of Brahm&acirc;.'</p>

<p>19. 'If the killer thinks that he kills, if the killed thinks that he is killed, they do not understand; for this one does not kill, nor is that one killed.'</p>  
<p>20. 'The Self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, smaller than small, greater than great, is hidden in the heart of that creature. A man who is free from desires and free from grief, sees the majesty of the Self by the grace of the Creator&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>21. 'Though sitting still, he walks far; though lying down, he goes everywhere&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Who, save myself, is able to know that God who rejoices and rejoices not?'</p>  
<p>22. 'The wise who knows the Self as bodiless within the bodies, as unchanging among changing things, as great and omnipresent, does never grieve.'</p>  
<p>23. 'That Self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> cannot be gained by the Veda, nor by understanding, nor by much learning. He whom the Self chooses, by him the Self can be gained. The Self chooses him (his body) as his own.'</p>  
<p>24. 'But he who has not first turned away from his wickedness, who is not tranquil, and subdued, or whose mind is not at rest, he can never obtain the Self (even) by knowledge!</p>  
<p>25. 'Who then knows where He is, He to whom the Brahmans and Kshatriyas are (as it were) but food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and death itself a condiment?'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_106"></A><A HREF="sbe15011.htm#fr_106">10:2</A> Yama seems here to propound the lower Brahman only, not yet the highest. Deva, God, can only be that as what the Old, i.e. the Self in the heart, is to be recognised. It would therefore mean, he who finds God or the Self in his heart. See afterwards, verse 21.</P>
