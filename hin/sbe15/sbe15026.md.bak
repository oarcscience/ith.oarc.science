### FIFTH ANUVÂKA.

1\. Bhû, Bhuvas, Suvas <span id="fr_206"></span>[4](#fn_206.md), these are
the three sacred interjections (vyâh*ri*ti). Mâhâ*k*amasya taught a
fourth, viz. Mahas, which is Brahman, which is the Self. The others
(devatâs) are its members.

Bhû is this world, Bhuvas is the sky, Suvas is the other world.

2\. Mahas is the sun. All the worlds are increased by the sun. Bhû is
Agni (fire), Bhuvas is Vâyu (air), Suvas is Âditya (sun). Mahas is the
moon. All the heavenly lights are increased by the moon.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

Bhû is the *Rik*-verses, Bhuvas is the Sâman-verses, Suvas is the
Ya*g*us-verses.

3\. Mahas is Brahman. All the Vedas are increased by the Brahman.

(1-2) Bhû is Prâ*n*a (up-breathing), Bhuvas is Apâna, (down-breathing),
Suvas is Vyâna (back-breathing). Mahas is food. All breathings are
increased by food.

Thus there are these four times four, the four and four sacred
interjections. He who knows these,

(1-2) Knows the Brahman. All Devas bring offerings to him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_203"></span>[48:1](sbe15025.htm#fr_203.md) The construction is
not right. Woolly, loma*s*â, is explained as 'possessed of woolly
sheep.'

<span id="fn_204"></span>[48:2](sbe15025.htm#fr_204.md) With the
interjection Svâhâ each oblation is offered.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[48:3](sbe15025.htm#fr_205.md) Bhaga, here
explained as bhagavat.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[48:4](sbe15026.htm#fr_206.md) The text varies
between Bhû, Bhuvas, Suvas, Mahas, and Bhû, Bhuvar, Suvar, Mahar.
