## FIFTH ADHYÂYA.

### FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_549"></span>[1](#fn_549.md).

1\. That (the invisible Brahman) is full, this (the visible Brahman) is
full} <span id="fr_550"></span>[2](#fn_550). This full (visible Brahman.md)
proceeds from that full (invisible Brahman). On grasping the fulness of
this full (visible Brahman) there is left that full (invisible
Brahman) <span id="fr_551"></span>[3](#fn_551.md).

Om (is) ether, (is) Brahman <span id="fr_552"></span>[4](#fn_552.md).
'There is the old ether (the invisible), and the (visible) ether of the
atmosphere,' thus said Kauravyâya*n*îputra. This (the Om) is the Veda
(the means of knowledge), thus the Brâhma*n*as know. One knows through
it all that has to be known.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_549"></span>[189:1](sbe15079.htm#fr_549.md) This is called a
Khila, or supplementary chapter, treating of various auxiliary means of
arriving at a knowledge of Brahman.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[189:2](sbe15079.htm#fr_550.md) Full and filling,
infinite.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[189:3](sbe15079.htm#fr_551.md) On perceiving the
true nature of the visible world., there remains, i.e. there is
perceived at once, as underlying it, or as being it, the invisible world
or Brahman. This and the following paragraph are called Mantras.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[189:4](sbe15079.htm#fr_552.md) This is explained
by *S*aṅkara as meaning, Brahman is Kha, the ether, and called Om, i.e.
Om and Kha are predicates of Brahman.
