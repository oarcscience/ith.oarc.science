### THIRD VALLÎ

1\. 'There are the two <span id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114.md), drinking
their reward in the world of their own works, entered into the cave (of
the heart), dwelling on the highest summit (the ether in the heart).
Those who know Brahman call them shade and light; likewise, those
householders who perform the Tri*n*â*k*iketa sacrifice.'

2\. 'May we be able to master that Nâ*k*iketa rite which is a bridge for
sacrificers; also that which is the highest, imperishable Brahman for
those who wish to cross over to the fearless shore <span
id="fr_115"></span>[2](#fn_115.md).'

3\. 'Know the Self to be sitting in the chariot, the body to be the
chariot, the intellect (buddhi) the charioteer, and the mind the
reins <span id="fr_116"></span>[3](#fn_116.md).'

4\. 'The senses they call the horses, the objects of the senses their
roads. When he (the Highest Self) is in union with the body, the senses,
and the mind, then wise people call him the Enjoyer.'

5\. 'He who has no understanding and whose mind

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the reins) is
never firmly held, his senses (horses) are unmanageable, like vicious
horses of a charioteer.'

6\. 'But he who has understanding and whose mind is always firmly held,
his senses are under control, like good horses of a charioteer.'

7\. 'He who has no understanding, who is unmindful and always impure,
never reaches that place, but enters into the round of births.'

8\. 'But he who has understanding, who is mindful and always pure,
reaches indeed that place, from whence he is not born again.'

9\. 'But he who has understanding for his charioteer, and who holds the
reins of the mind, he reaches the end of his journey, and that is the
highest place of Vish*n*u.'

10\. 'Beyond the senses there are the objects, beyond the objects there
is the mind, beyond the mind there is the intellect, the Great Self is
beyond the intellect.'

11\. 'Beyond the Great there is the Undeveloped, beyond the Undeveloped
there is the Person (purusha). Beyond the Person there is nothing--this
is the goal, the highest road.'

12\. 'That Self is hidden in all beings and does not shine forth, but it
is seen by subtle seers through their sharp and subtle intellect.'

13\. 'A wise man should keep down speech and mind <span
id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117.md); he should keep them within the Self
which is knowledge; he should keep knowledge within the Self which is
the Great; and he should keep that (the Great) within the Self which is
the Quiet.'

14\. 'Rise, awake! having obtained your boons <span
id="fr_118"></span>[2](#fn_118.md),

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

understand them! The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over;
thus the wise say the path (to the Self) is hard.'

15\. 'He who has perceived that which is without sound, without touch,
without form, without decay, without taste, eternal, without smell,
without beginning, without end, beyond the Great, and unchangeable, is
freed from the jaws of death.'

16\. 'A wise man who has repeated or heard the ancient story of
Na*k*iketas told by Death, is magnified in the world of Brahman.'

17\. 'And he who repeats this greatest mystery in an assembly of
Brâhmans, or full of devotion at the time of the *S*râddha sacrifice,
obtains thereby infinite rewards.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_114"></span>[12:1](sbe15012.htm#fr_114.md) The two are
explained as the higher and lower Brahman, the former being the light,
the latter the shadow. *Ri*ta is explained as reward, and connected with
suk*ri*ta, lit. good deeds, but frequently used in the sense of
svak*ri*ta, one's own good and evil deeds. The difficulty is, how the
highest Brahman can be said to drink the reward (*ri*tapa) of former
deeds, as it is above all works and above all rewards. The commentator
explains it away as a metaphorical expression, as we often speak of
many, when we mean one. (Cf. Mu*nd*. Up. III, 1, 1.) I have joined
suk*ri*tasya with loke, loka meaning the world, i.e. the state, the
environment, which we made to ourselves by our former deeds.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[12:2](sbe15012.htm#fr_115.md) These two verses
may be later additions.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[12:3](sbe15012.htm#fr_116.md) The simile of the
chariot has some points of similarity with the well-known passage in
Plato's Phædros, but Plato did not borrow this simile from the Brahmans,
as little as Xenophon need have consulted our Upanishad (II, 2) in
writing his prologue of Prodikos.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[13:1](sbe15012.htm#fr_117.md) *S*aṅkara
interprets, he should keep down speech in the mind.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[13:2](sbe15012.htm#fr_118.md) Comm., excellent
teachers.
