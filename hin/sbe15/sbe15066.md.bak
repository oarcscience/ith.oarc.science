### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_397"></span>[2](#fn_397.md).

1\. Then Bhu*g*yu Lâhyâyani asked. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'we
wandered about as students <span id="fr_398"></span>[3](#fn_398.md), and
came to the house of Pata*ñk*ala Kâpya. He had a daughter who was
possessed by a Gandharva. We asked him, 'Who art thou?' and he (the
Gandharva) replied: 'I am Sudhanvan, the Âṅgirasa.' And when we asked
him about the ends of the world, we said to him, 'Where were the
Pârikshitas <span id="fr_399"></span>[4](#fn_399.md)? Where then were the
Pârikshitas, I ask thee, Yâ*gñ*avalkya, where were the Pârikshitas?'

2\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'He said to thee, I suppose, that they went
where those go who have performed a horse-sacrifice.'

He said: 'And where do they go who have performed a horse-sacrifice?'

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'Thirty-two journeys of the car of the sun is
this world. The earth surrounds it on every side, twice as large, and
the ocean surrounds this earth on every side, twice as large. Now there
is between <span id="fr_400"></span>[1](#fn_400.md) them a space as large
as the edge of a razor or the wing of a mosquito. Indra, having become a
bird, handed them (through the space) to Vâyu (the air), and Vâyu (the
air), holding them within himself, conveyed them to where they dwell who
have performed a horse-sacrifice. Somewhat in this way did he praise
Vâyu indeed. Therefore Vâyu (air) is everything by itself, and Vâyu is
all things together. He who knows this, conquers death.' After that
Bhugyu Lâhyâyani held his peace.
