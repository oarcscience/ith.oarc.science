### SEVENTH PRAPÂTHAKA.

1\. Agni, the Gâyatra (metre), the Triv*ri*t (hymn), the Rathantara
(song), the spring, the upward breath (prâ*n*a), the Nakshatras, the
Vasus (deities)--these rise in the East; they warm, they rain, they
praise <span id="fr_1155"></span>[1](#fn_1152.md)

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the sun), they
enter again into him (the sun), they look out from him (the sun). He
(the sun) is inconceivable, without form, deep, covered, blameless,
solid, unfathomable, without qualities, pure, brilliant, enjoying the
play of the three qualities, awful, not caused, a master-magician <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[1](#fn_1153.md), the omniscient, the mighty,
immeasurable, without beginning or end, blissful, unborn, wise,
indescribable, the creator of all things, the self of all things, the
enjoyer of all things, the ruler of all things, the centre of the centre
of all things.

2\. Indra, the Trish*t*ubh (metre), the Pa*ñk*adasa (hymn), the B*ri*hat
(song), the summer, the through-going breath (Vyâna), Soma, the
Rudras--these rise in the South; they warm, they rain, they praise, they
enter again into him, they look out from him. He (the sun) is without
end or beginning, unmeasured, unlimited, not to be moved by another,
self-dependent, without sign, without form, of endless power, the
creator, the maker of light.

3\. The Maruts, the *G*agatî (metre), the Saptada*s*a (hymn), the
Vairupa (song), the rainy season, the downward breath (apâna), *S*ukra,
the Âdityas--these rise in the West; they warm, they rain, they praise,
they enter again into him, they look out from him. That is the tranquil,
the soundless, fearless, sorrowless, joyful, satisfied, firm, immovable,
immortal, eternal, true, the highest abode, bearing the name of
Vish*n*u.

4\. The Vi*s*ve Devas, the Anush*t*ubh (metre), the Ekavi*m*sa (hymn),
the Vairâ*g*a (song), the autumn, the equal breath (samâna), Varu*n*a,
the Sâdhyas--these rise in the North; they warm, they rain, they

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

praise, they enter again into him, they look out from him. He is pure
within, purifying, undeveloped, tranquil, breathless, selfless, endless.

5\. Mitrâ-Varu*n*au, the Paṅkti (metre), the Tri*n*avatrayastri*m*sa
(hymns), the *S*âkvara-raivata (songs), the snowy and dewy seasons, the
out-going breath (udâna), the Aṅgiras, the Moon--these rise above; they
warm, they rain, they praise, they enter again into him, they look out
from him--who is called Pra*n*ava (Om), the leader, consisting of light,
without sleep, old age, death, and sorrow.

6\. *S*ani (Saturn), Rahu and Ketu (the ascending and descending nodes),
the serpents, Rakshas, Yakshas, men, birds, *s*arabhas, elephants,
&c.--these rise below; they warm, they rain, they praise, they enter
again into him, they look out from him--he who is wise, who keeps things
in their right place, the centre of all, the imperishable, the pure, the
purifier, the bright, the patient, the tranquil.

7\. And he is indeed the Self, smaller (than small) within the heart,
kindled like fire, endowed with all forms. Of him is all this food,
within him all creatures are woven. That Self is free from sin <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[1](#fn_1154.md), free from old age, from death and
grief, from hunger and thirst, imagining nothing but what it ought to
imagine, and desiring nothing but what it ought to desire. He is the
highest lord, he is the supreme master of all beings, the guardian of
all beings, a boundary keeping all things apart in their right
places <span id="fr_1158"></span>[2](#fn_1155.md). He the Self, the lord,
is indeed Sambhu, Bhava, Rudra, Pra*g*âpati, the creator of all,
Hira*n*yagarbha,

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

the true, breath, the swan, the ruler, the eternal, Vish*n*u,
Nârâya*n*a. And he who abides in the fire, and he who abides in the
heart, and he who abides in the sun, they are one and the same. To thee
who art this, endowed with all forms, settled in the true ether, be
adoration!

8\. Now follow the impediments in the way of knowledge, O King <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[1](#fn_1156.md)! This is indeed the origin of the net
of bewilderment, that one who is worthy of heaven lives with those who
are not worthy of heaven. That is it. Though they have been told that
there is a grove before them, they cling to a small shrub. And others
also who are always merry, always abroad, always begging, always making
a living by handiwork; and others who are begging in towns, performing
sacrifices for those who are not allowed to offer sacrifices, who make
themselves the pupils of *S*ûdras, and *S*ûdras who know the sacred
books; and others who are malignant, who use bad language, dancers,
prize-fighters, travelling mendicants, actors, those who have been
degraded in the king's service; and others who for money pretend that
they can lay (the evil influences) of Yakshas, Râkshasas, ghosts,
goblins, devils, serpents, imps, &c.; and others who falsely wear red
dresses <span id="fr_1160"></span>[2](#fn_1157.md), earrings, and skulls;
and others who wish to entice by the jugglery of false arguments, mere
comparisons and paralogisms, the believers in the Veda--with all these
he should not

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

live together. They are clearly thieves, and unworthy of heaven. And
thus it is said:

'The world unsettled by the paralogisms of the denial of Self, by false
comparisons and arguments, does not know what is the difference between
Veda and philosophy <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1](#fn_1158.md).'

9\. B*ri*haspati, having become *S*ukra, brought forth that false
knowledge for the safety of Indra and for the destruction of the Asuras.
By it they show that good is evil, and that evil is good. They say that
we ought to ponder on the (new) law, which upsets the Veda and the other
sacred books <span id="fr_1162"></span>[2](#fn_1159.md). Therefore let no
one ponder on that false knowledge: it is wrong, it is, as it were,
barren. Its reward lasts only as long as the pleasure lasts, as with one
who has fallen from his caste. Let that false science not be attempted,
for thus it is said:

\(i\) Widely opposed and divergent are these two, the one known as false
knowledge, the other as knowledge. I (Yama) believe Na*k*iketas to be
possessed by a desire of knowledge; even many pleasures do not move
thee <span id="fr_1163"></span>[3](#fn_1160.md).

\(2\) He who knows at the same time both the imperfect (sacrifice, &c.)
and the perfect knowledge (of the Self), he crosses death by means of
the imperfect, and obtains immortality by means of the perfect
knowledge <span id="fr_1164"></span>[4](#fn_1161.md).

\(3\) Those who are wrapped up <span id="fr_1165"></span>[5](#fn_1162.md)
in the midst of

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

imperfect knowledge, fancying themselves alone wise and learned, they
wander about floundering and deceived, like the blind led by the
blind <span id="fr_1166"></span>[1](#fn_1163.md).

10\. The gods and the demons, wishing to know the Self, went into the
presence of Brahman (their father, Pra*g*âpati) <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[2](#fn_1164.md). Having bowed before him, they said:
'O blessed one, we wish to know the Self, do thou tell us.' Then, after
having pondered a long while, he thought, these demons are not yet
self-subdued <span id="fr_1168"></span>[3](#fn_1165.md); therefore a very
different Self was told to them (from what was told to the gods). On
that Self these deluded demons take their stand, clinging to it,
destroying the true means of salvation (the Veda), preaching untruth.
What is untrue they see as true, as in jugglery. Therefore, what is
taught in the Vedas, that is true. What is said in the Vedas, on that
the wise keep their stand. Therefore let a Brâhman not read what is not
of the Veda, or this will be the result.

11\. This is indeed the nature of it (the Veda), the supreme light of
the ether which is within the heart. This is taught as threefold, in the
fire, in the sun, in the breath. This is indeed the nature of it, the
syllable Om, of the ether which is within the heart. By it (by the Om)
that (light) starts, rises, breathes forth, becomes for ever the means
of the worship and knowledge of Brahman. That (light, in the shape of

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Om), when there is
breathing, takes the place of the internal heat, free from all
brightness <span id="fr_1169"></span>[1](#fn_1166.md). This is like the
action of smoke; for when there is a breath of air, the smoke, first
rising to the sky in one column, follows afterwards every bough,
envelopes it and takes its shape <span
id="fr_1170"></span>[2](#fn_1167.md). It is like throwing salt (into
water), like heating ghee <span id="fr_1171"></span>[3](#fn_1168.md). The
Veda comes and goes like the dissolving view of a master-magician <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[4](#fn_1169.md). And here they quote:

'Why then is it called "like lightning?" Because as soon as it comes
forth (as Om) it lights up the whole body. Therefore let a man worship
that boundless light by the syllable Om.'

\(1\) The man in the eye who abides in the right eye, he is Indra, and
his wife abides in the left eye <span id="fr_1173"></span>[5](#fn_1170.md).

\(2\) The union of these two takes place in the cavity within the heart,
and the ball of blood which is there, that is indeed the vigour and life
of these two.

\(3\) There is a channel going from the heart so far, and fixed in that
eye; that is the artery for both of them, being one, divided into two.

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

\(4\) The mind excites the fire of the body, that fire stirs the breath,
and the breath, moving in the chest, produces the low sound.

\(5\) Brought forth by the touch of the fire, as with a churning-stick,
it is at first a minim, from the minim it becomes in the throat a double
minim; on the tip of the tongue know that it is a treble minim, and,
when uttered, they call it the alphabet (στοιχεῖα) <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[1](#fn_1171.md).

\(6\) He who sees this, does not see death, nor disease, nor misery, for
seeing he sees all (objectively, not as affecting him subjectively); he
becomes all everywhere (he becomes Brahman).

\(7\) There is the person in the eye, there is he who walks as in sleep,
he who is sound asleep, and he who is above the sleeper: these are the
four conditions (of the Self), and the fourth is greater than all <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[2](#fn_1172.md).

\(8\) Brahman with one foot moves in the three, and Brahman with three
feet is in the last.

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

It is that both the true (in the fourth condition) and the untrue (in
the three conditions) may have their desert, that the Great Self (seems
to) become two, yes, that he (seems to) become two <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[1](#fn_1173.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1152"></span>[338:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1155.md) Other MSS. read
sruvanti, which seems better.

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[339:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1156.md) See VII, 11,
abhidhyâtur vist*ri*tir iva.

<span id="fn_1155"></span>[340:2](sbe15118.htm#fr_1158.md) See *Kh*ând. Up.
VIII, 4, 1, where we find setur vidh*ri*tir eshâ*m* lokânâm.

<span id="fn_1156"></span>[341:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1159.md) This king is not
meant for B*ri*hadratha.

<span id="fn_1157"></span>[341:2](sbe15118.htm#fr_1160.md) This refers to
people who claim the privileges and licence of Sannyâsins without having
passed through the discipline of the preceding â*s*ramas, As this was
one of the chief complaints made against the followers of *S*âkyamuni,
it might refer to Buddhists, but it ought to be borne in mind that there
were Buddhists before Buddha.

<span id="fn_1158"></span>[342:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1161.md) If we translate
thus, the use of vidyâ for v*ri*thâ vidyâ is unusual; if we follow the
commentary, we should have to translate, he does not know the Veda and
the other knowledge.

<span id="fn_1159"></span>[342:2](sbe15118.htm#fr_1162.md) All this may
refer to Buddhists, but not by necessity, for there were heretics, such
as B*ri*haspati, long before *S*âkyamuni.

<span id="fn_1160"></span>[342:3](sbe15118.htm#fr_1163.md) See Ka*th*. Up.
II, 4.

<span id="fn_1161"></span>[342:4](sbe15118.htm#fr_1164.md) See Vâ*g*. Up.
11.

<span id="fn_1162"></span>[342:5](sbe15118.htm#fr_1165.md)
Vesh*t*yamânâ*h*, instead of vartamânâ*h*.

<span id="fn_1163"></span>[343:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1166.md) See Ka*th*. Up.
II, 5.

<span id="fn_1164"></span>[343:2](sbe15118.htm#fr_1167.md) Cf. *Kh*ând. Up.
VIII, 8.

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[343:3](sbe15118.htm#fr_1168.md) I prefer
ayatâtmâna*h*, though it is the easier (sugama) reading, as compared
with anyatâtmâna*h*, those who seek for the Self elsewhere, namely, in
the body. It seems to me to refer to those who, without having subdued
the passions of their body, wish to obtain the knowledge of the Highest
Self. Possibly, however, the author may have intended a climax from
anyatâtmâna*h* to anyatamam.

<span id="fn_1166"></span>[344:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1169.md) This seems to be
the meaning adopted by the commentator; but may it not be, sending forth
brightness?

<span id="fn_1167"></span>[344:2](sbe15118.htm#fr_1170.md) The simile is
not very clear. The light of Brahman is below the sphere of fire in the
body. That sphere of fire becoming heated, the light of Brahman becomes
manifest. When the fire has been fanned by the wind of sonant breath,
then the light of Brahman, embodying itself in the wind and the fire,
manifests itself first in the mere sound of Om, but afterwards, checked
by throat, palate, &c., it assumes the form of articulate letters, and
ends by becoming the Veda in its many branches.

<span id="fn_1168"></span>[344:3](sbe15118.htm#fr_1171.md) As these are
outwardly changed, without losing their nature, thus the light of
Brahman, though assuming the different forms of the Veda, remains
itself.

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[344:4](sbe15118.htm#fr_1172.md) See before, VII,
1.

<span id="fn_1170"></span>[344:5](sbe15118.htm#fr_1173.md) See B*ri*h. Up.
IV, 2, 2, 3, where Indra is explained as Indha.

<span id="fn_1171"></span>[345:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1174.md) A comparison of
this verse with *Kh*ând. Up. VII, 26, shows the great freedom with which
the wording of these ancient verses was treated. Instead of--

Na pasyan m*ri*tyum pa*s*yati na roga*m* nota du*h*khatâm,  
Sarva*m* hi pa*s*yan pa*s*yati sarvam âpnoti sarva*s*a*h*,

the *Kh*ândogya Up. reads:

Na pa*s*yo m*ri*tyum pa*s*yati na roga*m* nota du*h*khatâm,  
Sarva*m* ha pa*s*ya*h* pa*s*yati sarvam âpnoti sarva*s*a*h*.

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[345:2](sbe15118.htm#fr_1175.md) The conditions
here described are sometimes called the Vi*s*va (Vai*s*vânara),
Tai*g*asa, Prâ*gñ*a, and Turîya. In the first state the Self is awake,
and enjoys the world; in the second he sees everything as in a dream; in
the third the two former states cease, and he is absorbed in sleep; in
the fourth he becomes again the pure Self. In the first state the Self
has the disguise of a coarse material body; in the second of a subtle
material body; in the third its disguise is potential only; in the
fourth it has no disguise, either potential or realised.

<span id="fn_1173"></span>[346:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1176.md) 'By reason of
the experience of the false and the true, the great Soul appears
possessed of duality.' Cowell.
