### FOURTH ANUVÂKA.

1\. May he <span id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_201.md) who is the strong bull
of the Vedas, assuming all forms, who has risen from the Vedas, from the
Immortal, may that Indra (lord) strengthen me with wisdom! May I, O God,
become an upholder of the Immortal!

May my body be able, my tongue sweet, may I hear much with my ears! Thou
(Om) art the shrine (of Brahman), covered by wisdom. Guard what I have
learnt <span id="fr_202"></span>[2](#fn_202.md).

She (*S*rî, happiness) brings near and spreads,

2\. And makes, without delay, garments for herself, cows, food, and
drink at all times; therefore bring that *S*rî (happiness) hither to me,
the woolly, with

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

her cattle <span id="fr_203"></span>[1](sbe15026.htm#fn_203.md)!
Svâhâ <span id="fr_204"></span>[2](sbe15026.htm#fn_204.md)! May the
Brahman-students come to me, Svâhâ! May they come from all sides, Svâhâ!
May they come forth to me, Svâhâ! May they practise restraint, Svâhâ!
May they enjoy peace, Svâhâ!

3\. May I be a glory among men, Svâhâ! May I be better than the richest,
Svâhâ! May I enter into thee, O treasure (Om), Svâhâ! Thou, O
treasure <span id="fr_205"></span>[3](sbe15026.htm#fn_205.md), enter into
me, Svâhâ! In thee, consisting of a thousand branches, in thee, O
treasure, I am cleansed, Svâhâ! As water runs downward, as the months go
to the year, so, O preserver of the world, may Brahman-students always
come to me from all sides, Svâhâ!

\(1\) Thou art a refuge! Enlighten me! Take possession of me!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_201"></span>[47:1](sbe15025.htm#fr_201.md) The next verses
form the prayer and oblation of those who wish for wisdom and happiness.
In the first verse it is supposed that the Om is invoked, the most
powerful syllable of the Vedas, the essence extracted from all the
Vedas, and in the end a name of Brahman. See *Kh*ând. Up. p. x seq.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[47:2](sbe15025.htm#fr_202.md) Here end the
prayers for the attainment of wisdom, to be followed by oblations for
the attainment of happiness.
