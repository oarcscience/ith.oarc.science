### FIFTH VALLÎ.

1\. 'There is a town with eleven <span id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md)
gates belonging to the Unborn (Brahman), whose thoughts are never
crooked. He who approaches it, grieves no more, and liberated (from all
bonds of ignorance) becomes free. This is that.'

2\. 'He (Brahman) <span id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124.md) is the swan
(sun), dwelling in the bright heaven; he is the Vasu (air), dwelling in
the sky; he is the sacrificer (fire), dwelling on the hearth; he is the
guest (Soma), dwelling in the sacrificial jar; he dwells in men, in gods
(vara), in the sacrifice (*ri*ta), in heaven; he is born in the water,
on earth, in the sacrifice (*ri*ta), on the mountains; he is the True
and the Great.'

3\. 'He (Brahman) it is who sends up the breath (prâ*n*a), and who
throws back the breath (apâna). All the Devas (senses) worship him, the
adorable (or the dwarf), who sits in the centre.'

4\. 'When that incorporated (Brahman), who dwells in the body, is torn
away and freed from the body, what remains then? This is that.'

5\. 'No mortal lives by the breath that goes up and by the breath that
goes down. We live by another, in whom these two repose.'

6\. 'Well then, O Gautama, I shall tell thee this mystery, the old
Brahman, and what happens to the Self, after reaching death.'

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

7\. 'Some enter the womb in order to have a body, as organic beings,
others go into inorganic matter, according to their work and according
to their knowledge <span id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_125.md).'

8\. 'He, the highest Person, who is awake in us while we are asleep,
shaping one lovely sight after another, that indeed is the Bright, that
is Brahman, that alone is called the Immortal. All worlds are contained
in it, and no one goes beyond. This is that <span
id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_126.md).'

9\. 'As the one fire, after it has entered the world, though one,
becomes different according to whatever it burns, thus the one Self
within all things becomes different, according to whatever it enters,
and exists also without <span id="fr_127"></span>[3](#fn_127.md).'

10\. 'As the one air, after it has entered the world, though one,
becomes different according to whatever it enters, thus the one Self
within all things becomes different, according to whatever it enters,
and exists also without.'

11\. 'As the sun, the eye of the whole world, is not contaminated by the
external impurities seen by the eyes, thus the one Self within all
things is never contaminated by the misery of the world, being himself
without <span id="fr_128"></span>[4](#fn_128.md).'

12\. 'There is one ruler, the Self within all things, who makes the one
form manifold. The wise who perceive him within their Self, to them
belongs eternal happiness, not to others <span
id="fr_129"></span>[5](#fn_129.md).'

13\. 'There is one eternal thinker, thinking non-eternal

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

thoughts, who, though one, fulfils the desires of many. The wise who
perceive him within their Self, to them belongs eternal peace, not to
others <span id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_130.md).'

14\. 'They perceive that highest indescribable pleasure, saying, This is
that. How then can I understand it? Has it its own light, or does it
reflect light?'

15\. 'The sun does not shine there, nor the moon and the stars, nor
these lightnings, and much less this fire. When he shines, everything
shines after him; by his light all this is lighted <span
id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_131.md).'
