### SECOND VALLÎ

1\. Death said: 'The good is one thing, the pleasant another; these two,
having different objects, chain a man. It is well with him who clings to
the good; he who chooses the pleasant, misses his end.'

2\. 'The good and the pleasant approach man: the wise goes round about
them and distinguishes them. Yea, the wise prefers the good to the
pleasant, but the fool chooses the pleasant through greed and avarice.'

3\. 'Thou, O Na*k*iketas, after pondering all pleasures that are or seem
delightful, hast dismissed them all. Thou hast not gone into the
road <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95) that leadeth to wealth, in
which many men perish.'

4\. 'Wide apart and leading to different points are these two,
ignorance, and what is known as wisdom. I believe Na*k*iketas to be one
who desires knowledge, for even many pleasures did not tear thee
away <span id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_96).'

5\. 'Fools dwelling in darkness, wise in their own conceit, and puffed
up with vain knowledge, go round and round, staggering to and fro, like
blind men led by the blind <span id="fr_97"></span>[3](#fn_97).'

6\. 'The Hereafter never rises before the eyes of the careless child,
deluded by the delusion of wealth. "This is the world," he thinks,
"there is no other;"--thus he falls again and again under my sway.'

7\. 'He (the Self) of whom many are not even able

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

to hear, whom many, even when they hear of him, do not comprehend;
wonderful is a man, when found, who is able to teach him (the Self);
wonderful is he who comprehends him, when taught by an able
teacher <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_98).'

8\. 'That (Self), when taught by an inferior man, is not easy to be
known, even though often thought upon <span
id="fr_99"></span>[2](#fn_99); unless it be taught by another, there is
no way to it, for it is inconceivably smaller than what is small <span
id="fr_100"></span>[3](#fn_100).'

9\. 'That doctrine is not to be obtained <span
id="fr_101"></span>[4](#fn_101) by argument, but when it is declared by
another, then, O dearest, it is easy to understand. Thou hast obtained
it now <span id="fr_102"></span>[5](#fn_102); thou art truly a man of
true resolve. May we have always an inquirer like thee <span
id="fr_103"></span>[6](#fn_103)!'

10\. Na*k*iketas said: 'I know that what is called a treasure is
transient, for that eternal is not obtained by things which are not
eternal. Hence the Nâkiketa fire(-sacrifice) has been laid by me
(first); then, by means of transient things, I have obtained what is not
transient (the teaching of Yama) <span id="fr_104"></span>[7](#fn_104).'

11\. Yama said: 'Though thou hadst seen the fulfilment of all desires,
the foundation of the world, the endless rewards of good deeds, the
shore where

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

there is no fear, that which is magnified by praise, the wide abode, the
rest <span id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105), yet being wise thou hast
with firm resolve dismissed it all.'

12\. 'The wise who, by means of meditation on his Self, recognises the
Ancient, who is difficult to be seen, who has entered into the dark, who
is hidden in the cave, who dwells in the abyss, as God, he indeed leaves
joy and sorrow far behind <span id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_106).'

13\. 'A mortal who has heard this and embraced it, who has separated
from it all qualities, and has thus reached the subtle Being, rejoices,
because he has obtained what is a cause for rejoicing. The house (of
Brahman) is open, I believe, O Na*k*iketas.'

14\. Na*k*iketas said: 'That which thou seest as neither this nor that,
as neither effect nor cause, as neither past nor future, tell me that.'

15\. Yama said: 'That word (or place) which all the Vedas record, which
all penances proclaim, which men desire when they live as religious
students, that word I tell thee briefly, it is Om <span
id="fr_107"></span>[3](#fn_107).'

16\. 'That (imperishable) syllable means Brahman, that syllable means
the highest (Brahman); he who knows that syllable, whatever he desires,
is his.'

17\. 'This is the best support, this is the highest support; he who
knows that support is magnified in the world of Brahmâ.'

18\. 'The knowing (Self) is not born, it dies not; it sprang from
nothing, nothing sprang from it. The

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ancient is unborn,
eternal, everlasting; he is not killed, though the body is killed <span
id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_108).'

19\. 'If the killer thinks that he kills, if the killed thinks that he
is killed, they do not understand; for this one does not kill, nor is
that one killed.'

20\. 'The Self <span id="fr_109"></span>[2](#fn_109), smaller than
small, greater than great, is hidden in the heart of that creature. A
man who is free from desires and free from grief, sees the majesty of
the Self by the grace of the Creator <span
id="fr_110"></span>[3](#fn_110).'

21\. 'Though sitting still, he walks far; though lying down, he goes
everywhere <span id="fr_111"></span>[4](#fn_111). Who, save myself, is
able to know that God who rejoices and rejoices not?'

22\. 'The wise who knows the Self as bodiless within the bodies, as
unchanging among changing things, as great and omnipresent, does never
grieve.'

23\. 'That Self <span id="fr_112"></span>[5](#fn_112) cannot be gained
by the Veda, nor by understanding, nor by much learning. He whom the
Self chooses, by him the Self can be gained. The Self chooses him (his
body) as his own.'

24\. 'But he who has not first turned away from his wickedness, who is
not tranquil, and subdued, or whose mind is not at rest, he can never
obtain the Self (even) by knowledge!

25\. 'Who then knows where He is, He to whom the Brahmans and Kshatriyas
are (as it were) but food <span id="fr_113"></span>[6](#fn_113), and
death itself a condiment?'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_95"></span>[8:1](sbe15011.htm#fr_95) Cf. I, 16.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[8:2](sbe15011.htm#fr_96) The commentator
explains lolupanta*h* by vi*kkh*eda*m* k*ri*tavanta*h*. Some MSS. read
lolupante and lolupanti, but one expects either lolupyante or lolupati.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[8:3](sbe15011.htm#fr_97) Cf. Mu*nd*. Up. II, 8.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[9:1](sbe15011.htm#fr_98) Cf. Bhag. Gîtâ II, 29.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[9:2](sbe15011.htm#fr_99) Cf. Mu*nd*. Up. II, 4.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[9:3](sbe15011.htm#fr_100) I read
a*n*upramâ*n*ât. Other interpretations: If it is taught by one who is
identified with the Self, then there is no uncertainty. If it has been
taught as identical with ourselves, then there is no perception of
anything else. If it has been taught by one who is identified with it,
then there is no failure in understanding it (agati).

<span id="fn_101"></span>[9:4](sbe15011.htm#fr_101) Âpaneyâ; should it
be âpanâya, as afterwards sug*ñ*ânâya?

<span id="fn_102"></span>[9:5](sbe15011.htm#fr_102) Because you insist
on my teaching it to thee.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[9:6](sbe15011.htm#fr_103) Unless no is
negative, for Yama, at first, does not like to communicate his
knowledge.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[9:7](sbe15011.htm#fr_104) The words in
parentheses have been added in order to remove the otherwise
contradictory character of the two lines.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[10:1](sbe15011.htm#fr_105) Cf. *Kh*ând. Up.
VII, 12, 2.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[10:2](sbe15011.htm#fr_106) Yama seems here to
propound the lower Brahman only, not yet the highest. Deva, God, can
only be that as what the Old, i.e. the Self in the heart, is to be
recognised. It would therefore mean, he who finds God or the Self in his
heart. See afterwards, verse 21.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[10:3](sbe15011.htm#fr_107) Cf. *S*vet. Up. IV,
9; Bhag. Gîtâ VIII, 11.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[11:1](sbe15011.htm#fr_108) As to verses 18 and
19, see Bhag. Gîtâ II, 19, 20.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[11:2](sbe15011.htm#fr_109) Cf. *S*vet. Up.
III, 2 0; Taitt. Âr. X, 12, 1.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[11:3](sbe15011.htm#fr_110) The commentator
translates 'through the tranquillity of the senses,' i.e. dhâtuprasâdât,
taking prasâda in the technical sense of samprasâda. As to kratu,
desire, or rather, will, see B*ri*h. Âr. IV, 4; 5.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[11:4](sbe15011.htm#fr_111) Cf. Tal. Up, 5.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[11:5](sbe15011.htm#fr_112) Cf. I, 7-9; Mu*nd*.
Up. III, 2, 3; Bhag. Gîtâ I, 53.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[11:6](sbe15011.htm#fr_113) In whom all
disappears, and in whom even death is swallowed up.
