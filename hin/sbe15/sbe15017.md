### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. This is the truth <span id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_162.md): the
sacrificial works which they (the poets) saw in the hymns (of the Veda)
have been performed in many ways in the Tretâ age <span
id="fr_163"></span>[2](#fn_163.md). Practise <span
id="fr_164"></span>[3](#fn_164.md) them diligently, ye lovers of truth,
this is your path that leads to the world of good works <span
id="fr_165"></span>[4](#fn_165.md)!

2\. When the fire is lighted and the flame flickers, let a man offer his
oblations between the two portions of melted butter, as an offering with
faith.

3\. If a man's Agnihotra sacrifice <span id="fr_166"></span>[5](#fn_166.md)
is not followed

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

by the new-moon and full-moon sacrifices, by the four-months'
sacrifices, and by the harvest sacrifice, if it is unattended by guests,
not offered at all, or without the Vaisvadeva ceremony, or not offered
according to rule, then it destroys his seven worlds <span
id="fr_167"></span>[1](#fn_167.md).

4\. Kâlî (black), Karâlî (terrific), Mano*g*avâ (swift as thought),
Sulohitâ (very red), Sudhûmravar*n*â (purple), Sphuliṅginî (sparkling),
and the brilliant Vi*s*varûpî <span id="fr_168"></span>[2](#fn_168.md)
(having all forms), all these playing about are called the seven tongues
(of fire).

5\. If a man performs his sacred works when these flames are shining,
and the oblations follow at the right time, then they lead him as
sun-rays to where the one Lord of the Devas dwells.

6\. Come hither, come hither! the brilliant oblations say to him, and
carry the sacrificer on the rays of the sun, while they utter pleasant
speech and praise him, saying: 'This is thy holy Brahma-world (Svarga),
gained by thy good works.'

7\. But frail, in truth, are those boats, the sacrifices, the eighteen,
in which this lower ceremonial has been told <span
id="fr_169"></span>[3](#fn_169.md). Fools who praise this as the highest
good, are subject again and again to old age and death.

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

8\. Fools dwelling in darkness, wise in their own conceit, and puffed up
with vain knowledge, go round and round staggering to and fro, like
blind men led by the blind <span id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_170.md).

9\. Children, when they have long lived in ignorance, consider
themselves happy. Because those who depend on their good works are,
owing to their passions, improvident, they fall and become miserable
when their life (in the world which they had gained by their good works)
is finished.

10\. Considering sacrifice and good works as the best, these fools know
no higher good, and having enjoyed (their reward) on the height of
heaven, gained by good works, they enter again this world or a lower
one.

11\. But those <span id="fr_171"></span>[2](#fn_171.md) who practise
penance and faith in the forest, tranquil, wise, and living on alms,
depart free from passion through the sun to where that immortal Person
dwells whose nature is imperishable <span
id="fr_172"></span>[3](#fn_172.md).

12\. Let a Brâhma*n*a, after he has examined all these worlds which are
gained by works, acquire freedom from all desires. Nothing that is
eternal (not made) can be gained by what is not eternal (made). Let him,
in order to understand this, take

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

fuel in his hand and approach a Guru who is learned and dwells entirely
in Brahman.

13\. To that pupil who has approached him respectfully, whose thoughts
are not troubled by any desires, and who has obtained perfect peace, the
wise teacher truly told that knowledge of Brahman through which he knows
the eternal and true Person.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_162"></span>[30:1](sbe15017.htm#fr_162.md) In the beginning of
the second Kha*nd*a the lower knowledge is first described, referring to
the performance of sacrifices and other good deeds. The reward of them
is perishable, and therefore a desire is awakened after the higher
knowledge.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[30:2](sbe15017.htm#fr_163.md) The Tretâ age is
frequently mentioned as the age of sacrifices. I should prefer, however,
to take tretâ in the sense of trayî vidyâ, and santata as developed,
because the idea that the Tretâ age was distinguished by its sacrifices,
seems to me of later origin. Even the theory of the four ages or yugas,
though known in the Ait. Brâhma*n*a, is not frequently alluded to in the
older Upanishads. See Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 283.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[30:3](sbe15017.htm#fr_164.md) The termination tha
for ta looks suspiciously Buddhistic; see 'Sanskrit Texts discovered in
Japan,' J. R. A. S. 1880, p. 180.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[30:4](sbe15017.htm#fr_165.md) Svak*ri*ta and
suk*ri*ta are constantly interchanged. They mean the same, good deeds,
or deeds performed by oneself and believed to be good.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[30:5](sbe15017.htm#fr_166.md) At the Agnihotra,
the first of all sacrifices, and the type of many others, two portions
of â*g*ya are sacrificed on the right and left side of the Âhavanîya
altar. The place between the two is called the Âvâpasthâna, and here the
oblations to the gods are to be offered. There are. two oblations in the
morning to Sûrya and Pra*g*âpati, two in the evening to Agni and
Pra*g*âpati. Other sacrifices, such as the Dar*s*a and Pûr*n*amâsa, and
those mentioned in verse 3, are connected with the Agnihotra.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[31:1](sbe15017.htm#fr_167.md) The seven worlds
form the rewards of a pious sacrificer, the first is Bhu*h*, the last
Satya. The seven worlds may also be explained as the worlds of the
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, of the son, the grandson,
and great-grandson, and of the sacrificer himself.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[31:2](sbe15017.htm#fr_168.md) Or Vi*s*varu*k*î,
if there is any authority for this reading in Mahîdhara's commentary to
the Vâ*g*as. Sa*m*hitâ XVII, 79. The Râjah of Besmah's edition has
vi*s*varukî, which is also the reading adopted by Rammohun Roy, see
Complete Works, vol. i, p. 579.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[31:3](sbe15017.htm#fr_169.md) The commentator
takes the eighteen for the sixteen priests, the sacrificer, and his
wife. But such an explanation hardly yields a satisfactory meaning, nor
does plava mean perishable.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[32:1](sbe15017.htm#fr_170.md) Cf. Ka*th*. Up. II,
5.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[32:2](sbe15017.htm#fr_171.md) According to the
commentator, this verse refers to those who know the uselessness of
sacrifices and have attained to a knowledge of the qualified Brahman.
They live in the forest as Vânaprasthas and Sa*m*nyâsins, practising
tapas, i.e. whatever is proper for their state, and *s*raddhâ, i.e. a
knowledge of Hira*n*yagarbha. The wise are the learned G*ri*hasthas,
while those who live on alms are those who have forsaken their family.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[32:3](sbe15017.htm#fr_172.md) That person is
Hira*n*yagarbha. His immortality is relative only, it lasts no longer
than the world (sa*m*sâra).
