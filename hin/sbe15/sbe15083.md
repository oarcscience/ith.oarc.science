Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

1\. In the beginning this (world) was water. Water produced the
true <span id="fr_556"></span>[1](#fn_556.md), and the true is 'Brahman.
Brahman produced Pra*g*âpati <span id="fr_557"></span>[2](#fn_557.md),
Pra*g*âpati the Devas (gods). The Devas adore the true (satyam) alone.
This satyam consists of three syllables. One syllable is sa, another
t(i), the third <span id="fr_558"></span>[3](#fn_558.md) yam. The first and
last syllables are true, in the middle there is the untrue <span
id="fr_559"></span>[4](#fn_559.md). This untrue is on both sides enclosed
by the true, and thus the true preponderates. The untrue does not hurt
him who knows this.

2\. Now what is the true, that is the Âditya (the sun), the person that
dwells in yonder orb, and the person in the right eye. These two rest on
each other, the former resting with his rays in the latter, the latter
with his prâ*n*as (senses) in the former. When the latter is on the
point of departing this life, he sees that orb as white only, and those
rays (of the sun) do not return to him.

3\. Now of the person in that (solar) orb Bhû*h* is the head, for the
head is one, and that syllable is one; Bhuva*h* the two arms, for the
arms are two, and these syllables are two; Svar the foot, for the feet
are two, and these syllables are two <span
id="fr_560"></span>[1](#fn_560). Its secret name is Ahar (day.md), and he
who knows this destroys (hanti) evil and leaves (*g*ahâti) it.

4\. Of the person in the right eye Bhû*h* is the head, for the head is
one, and that syllable is one; Bhuva*h* the two arms, for the arms are
two, and these syllables are two; Svar the foot, for the feet are two,
and these syllables are two. Its secret name is Aham (ego), and he who
knows this, destroys (hanti) evil and leaves (*g*ahâti) it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_556"></span>[191:1](sbe15083.htm#fr_556.md) Here explained by
the commentator as Pûtrâtmaka Hira*n*yagarbha.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[191:2](sbe15083.htm#fr_557.md) Here explained as
Virâ*g*.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[191:3](sbe15083.htm#fr_558.md) Satyam is often
pronounced satiam, as trisyllabic. *S*aṅkara, however, takes the second
syllable as t only, and explains the i after it as an anubandha. The
Kâ*n*va text gives the three syllables as sa, ti, am, which seems
preferable; cf. *Kh*ând. Up. VIII, 3, 5; Taitt. Up. II, 6.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[191:4](sbe15083.htm#fr_559.md) This is explained
by a mere play on the letters, sa and ya having nothing in common with
m*ri*tyu, death, whereas t occurs in m*ri*tyu and an*ri*ta. Dvivedagaṅga
takes sa and am as true, because they occur in satya and am*ri*ta, and
not in m*ri*tyu, while ti is untrue, because the t occurs in m*ri*tyu
and am*ri*ta.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[192:1](sbe15083.htm#fr_560.md) Svar has to be
pronounced suvar.
