### SECOND QUESTION.

1\. Then Bhârgava Vaidarbhi asked him: 'Sir, How many gods <span
id="fr_881"></span>[1](#fn_879) keep what has thus been created, how
many manifest this <span id="fr_882"></span>[2](#fn_880), and who is the
best of them?'

2\. He replied: 'The ether is that god, the wind, fire, water, earth,
speech, mind, eye, and ear. These, when they have manifested (their
power), contend and say: We (each of us) support this body and keep
it <span id="fr_883"></span>[3](#fn_881).

3 <span id="fr_884"></span>[4](#fn_882). Then Prâ*n*a (breath, spirit,
life), as the best, said to them: Be not deceived, I alone, dividing
myself fivefold, support this body and keep it.

4\. They were incredulous; so he, from pride, did as if he were going
out from above. Thereupon,

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

as he went out, all the others went out, and as he returned, all the
others returned. As bees go out when their queen <span
id="fr_885"></span>[1](#fn_883) goes out, and return when she returns,
thus (did) speech, mind, eye, and ear; and, being satisfied, they praise
Prâ*n*a, saying:

5\. He is Agni (fire), he shines as Sûrya (sun), he is Par*g*anya
(rain), the powerful (Indra), he is Vâyu, (wind), he is the earth, he is
matter, he is God--he is what is and what is not, and what is immortal.

6\. As spokes in the nave of a wheel, everything is fixed in Prâ*n*a,
the verses of the *Ri*g-veda, Ya*g*ur-veda, Sâma-veda, the sacrifice,
the Kshatriyas, and the Brâhmans.

7\. As Pra*g*âpati (lord of creatures) thou movest about in the womb,
thou indeed art born again. To thee, the Prâ*n*a, these creatures bring
offerings, to thee who dwellest with the other prâ*n*as (the organs of
sense).

8\. Thou art the best carrier for the Gods, thou art the first
offering <span id="fr_886"></span>[2](#fn_884) to the Fathers. Thou art
the true work of the Rishis <span id="fr_887"></span>[3](#fn_885), of
the Atharvâṅgiras.

9\. O Prâ*n*a, thou art Indra by thy light, thou art Rudra, as a
protector; thou movest in the sky, thou art the sun, the lord of lights.

10\. When thou showerest down rain, then, O Prâ*n*a, these creatures of
thine are delighted <span id="fr_888"></span>[4](#fn_886), hoping that
there will be food, as much as they desire.

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

11\. Thou art a Vrâtya <span id="fr_889"></span>[1](#fn_887), O Prâ*n*a,
the only *Ri*shi <span id="fr_890"></span>[2](#fn_888), the consumer of
everything, the good lord. We are the givers of what thou hast to
consume, thou, O Mâtari*s*va <span id="fr_891"></span>[3](#fn_889), art
our father.

12\. Make propitious that body of thine which dwells in speech, in the
ear, in the eye, and which pervades the mind; do not go away!

13\. All this is in the power of Prâ*n*a, whatever exists in the three
heavens. Protect us like a mother her sons, and give us happiness and
wisdom.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_879"></span>[274:1](sbe15107.htm#fr_881) Devâ*h*, powers,
organs, senses.

<span id="fn_880"></span>[274:2](sbe15107.htm#fr_882) Their respective
power.

<span id="fn_881"></span>[274:3](sbe15107.htm#fr_883) This is
*S*aṅkara's explanation, in which bâ*n*a is taken to mean the same as
*s*arîra, body. But there seems to be no authority for such a meaning,
and Ânandagiri tries in vain to find an etymological excuse for it.
Bâ*n*a or Vâ*n*a generally means an arrow, or, particularly in
Brâhma*n*a writings, a harp with many strings. I do not see how an arrow
could be used as an appropriate simile here, but a harp might, if we
take avash*t*abhya in the sense of holding the frame of the instrument,
and vidhârayâma*h* in the sense of stretching and thereby modulating it.

<span id="fn_882"></span>[274:4](sbe15107.htm#fr_884) On this dispute of
the organs of sense, see B*ri*h. Up. VI, 1, p. 201; *Kh*ând. Up. V, 1
(S. B. E., vol. i, p. 72).

<span id="fn_883"></span>[275:1](sbe15107.htm#fr_885) In Sanskrit it is
madhukararâ*g*a, king of the bees.

<span id="fn_884"></span>[275:2](sbe15107.htm#fr_886) When a *s*râddha
is offered to the Pit*ri*s.

<span id="fn_885"></span>[275:3](sbe15107.htm#fr_887) Explained as the
eye and the other organs of sense which the chief Prâ*n*a supports; but
it is probably an old verse, here applied to a special purpose.

<span id="fn_886"></span>[275:4](sbe15107.htm#fr_888) Another reading is
prâ*n*ate, they breathe.

<span id="fn_887"></span>[276:1](sbe15107.htm#fr_889) A person for whom
the sa*m*skâras, the sacramental and initiatory rites, have not been
performed. *S*aṅkara says that, as he was the first born, there was no
one to perform them for him, and that he is called Vrâtya, because he
was pure by nature. This is all very doubtful.

<span id="fn_888"></span>[276:2](sbe15107.htm#fr_890) Agni is said to be
the *Ri*shi of the Âtharva*n*as.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[276:3](sbe15107.htm#fr_891) Instead of the
irregular vocative Mâtari*s*va, there is another reading,
Mâtari*s*vana*h*, i.e. thou art the father of Mâtari*s*van, the wind,
and therefore of the whole world.
