### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_337.md).

1\. There are two forms of Brahman, the material and the immaterial, the
mortal and the immortal, the solid and the fluid, sat (being) and tya
(that), (i.e. sat-tya, true) <span id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_338.md).

2\. Everything except air and sky is material, is mortal, is solid, is
definite. The essence of that which is material, which is mortal, which
is solid, which is definite is the sun that shines, for he is the
essence of sat (the definite).

3\. But air and sky are immaterial, are immortal, are fluid, are
indefinite. The essence of that which is immaterial, which is immortal,
which is fluid, which is indefinite is the person in the disk of the
sun, for he is the essence of tyad (the indefinite). So far with regard
to the Devas.

4\. Now with regard to the body. Everything except the breath and the
ether within the body is material, is mortal, is solid, is definite. The
essence of that which is material, which is mortal, which is solid,
which is definite is the Eye, for it is the essence of sat (the
definite).

5\. But breath and the ether within the body are immaterial, are
immortal, are fluid, are indefinite. The essence of that which is
immaterial, which is immortal, which is fluid, which is indefinite is
the person in the right eye, for he is the essence of tyad (the
indefinite).

6\. And what is the appearance of that person? Like a saffron-coloured
raiment, like white wool,

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

like cochineal, like the flame of fire, like the white lotus, like
sudden lightning. He who knows this, his glory is like unto sudden
lightning.

Next follows the teaching (of Brahman) by No, no <span
id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_339.md)! for there is nothing else higher than
this (if one says): 'It is not so.' Then comes the name 'the True of the
True,' the senses being the True, and he (the Brahman) the True of them.
