### ELEVENTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

This is indeed the highest penance, if a man, laid up with sickness,
suffers pain <span id="fr_566"></span>[1](#fn_566). He who knows this,
conquers the highest world.

This is indeed the highest penance, if they carry a dead person into the
forest <span id="fr_567"></span>[2](#fn_567). He who knows this,
conquers the highest world.

This is indeed the highest penance, if they place a dead person on the
fire <span id="fr_568"></span>[3](#fn_568). He who knows this, conquers
the highest world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_566"></span>[194:1](sbe15089.htm#fr_566) The meaning is
that, while he is suffering pain from illness, he should think that he
was performing penance. If he does that, he obtains the same reward for
his sickness which he would have obtained for similar pain inflicted on
himself for the sake of performing penance.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[194:2](sbe15089.htm#fr_567) This is like the
penance of leaving the village and living in the forest.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[194:3](sbe15089.htm#fr_568) This is like the
penance of entering into the fire.
