## THE *S*VETÂ*S*VATARA-UPANISHAD.

THE *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad has been handed down as one of the
thirty-three Upanishads of the Taittirîyas, and though this has been
doubted, no real argument has ever been brought forward to invalidate
the tradition which represents it as belonging to the Taittirîya or
Black Ya*g*ur-veda.

It is sometimes called *S*vetâ*s*vatarâ*n*âm Mantropanishad (p. 274),
and is frequently spoken of in the plural, as
*S*vetâ*s*vataropanishada*h*. At the end of the last Adhyâya we read
that *S*vetâ*s*vatara told it to the best among the hermits, and that it
should be kept secret, and not be taught to any one except to a son or a
regular pupil. It is also called *S*vetâ*s*va <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md), though, it would seem, for the sake of
the metre only. The *S*vetâ*s*vataras are mentioned as a *S*âkha <span
id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_30.md), subordinate to the *K*arakas; but of the
literature belonging to them in particular, nothing is ever mentioned
beyond this Upanishad.

*S*vetâ*s*vatara means a white mule, and as mules were known and prized
in India from the earliest times, *S*vetâ*s*vatara, as the name of a
person, is no more startling than *S*vetâ*s*va, white horse, an epithet
of Ar*g*una. Now as no one would be likely to conclude from the name of
one of the celebrated Vedic *Ri*shis, *S*yâvâ*s*va, i.e. black horse,
that negro influences might be discovered in his hymns, it is hardly
necessary to say that all speculations as to Christian influences, or
the teaching of white Syro-Christian missionaries, being indicated by
the name of *S*vetâ*s*vatara, are groundless <span
id="fr_31"></span>[3](#fn_31.md).

The *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad holds a very high rank among the
Upanishads. Though we cannot say that it is quoted by name by Bâdarâyana
in the Vedânta-sûtras,

<span id="page_xxxii">p. xxxii</span>

it is distinctly referred to as sruta or revealed <span
id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md). It is one of the twelve Upanishads chosen
by Vidyâranya in his Sarvopanishad-arthânabhûtiprakâ*s*a, and it was
singled out by *S*aṅkara as worthy of a special commentary.

The *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad seems to me one of the most difficult,
and at the same time one of the most interesting works of its kind.
Whether on that and on other grounds it should be assigned to a more
ancient or to a more modern period is what, in the present state of our
knowledge, or, to be honest, of our ignorance of minute chronology
during the Vedic period, no true scholar would venture to assert. We
must be satisfied to know that, as a class, the Upanishads are
presupposed by the Kalpa-sûtras, that some of them, called
Mantra-upanishads, form part of the more modern Sa*m*hitâs, and that
there are portions even in the Rig-veda-sa*m*hitâ <span
id="fr_33"></span>[2](#fn_33.md) for which the name of Upanishad is claimed
by the Anukrama*n*îs. We find them most frequent, however, during the
Brâhma*n*a-period, in the Brâhma*n*as themselves, and, more especially,
in those portions which are called Âra*n*yakas, while a large number of
them is referred to the Atharva-veda. That, in imitation of older
Upanishads, similar treatises were composed to a comparatively recent
time, has, of course, long been known <span
id="fr_34"></span>[3](#fn_34.md).

But when we approach the question whether among the ancient and genuine
Upanishads one may be older than the other, we find that, though we may
guess much, we can prove nothing. The Upanishads belonged to Parishads
or settlements spread all over India. There is a stock of ideas, even of
expressions, common to most of them. Yet, the ideas collected in the
Upanishads cannot all have grown tip in one and the same place, still
less in regular succession. They must have had an independent growth,
determined by individual and local influences, and opinions which in one
village might seem far advanced, would in another be looked upon as
behind the world. We may

<span id="page_xxxiii">p. xxxiii</span>

admire the ingeniousness of those who sometimes in this, sometimes in
that peculiarity see a clear indication of the modern date of an
Upanishad, but to a conscientious scholar such arguments are really
distasteful for the very sake of their ingeniousness. He knows that they
will convince many who do not know the real difficulties; he knows they
will have to be got out of the way with no small trouble, and he knows
that, even if they should prove true in the end, they will require very
different support from what they have hitherto received, before they can
be admitted to the narrow circle of scientific facts.

While fully admitting therefore that the *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad has
its peculiar features and its peculiar difficulties, I must most
strongly maintain that no argument that has as yet been brought forward,
seems to me to prove, in any sense of the word, its modern character.

It has been said, for instance, that the *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad is a
sectarian Upanishad, because, when speaking of the Highest Self or the
Highest Brahman, it applies such names to him as Hara (I, 10), Rudra
(II, 17; III, 2; 4; IV, 12; 21; 22), *S*iva (III, 14; IV, 10), Bhagavat
(III, 14), Agni, Âditya, Vâyu, &c. (IV, 2). But here it is simply taken
for granted that the idea of the Highest Self was developed first, and,
after it had reached its highest purity, was lowered again by an
identification with mythological and personal deities. The questions
whether the conception of the Highest Self was formed once and once
only, whether it was formed after all the personal and mythological
deities had first been merged into one Lord (Pra*g*âpati), or whether it
was discovered behind the veil of any other name in the mythological
pantheon of the past, have never been mooted. Why should not an ancient
Rishi have said: What we have hitherto called Rudra, and what we worship
as Agni, or *S*iva, is in reality the Highest Self, thus leaving much of
the ancient mythological phraseology to be used with a new meaning? Why
should we at once conclude that late sectarian worshippers of
mythological gods replaced again the Highest Self, after their fathers
had discovered it, by their own sectarian names? If we adopt the former

<span id="page_xxxiv">p. xxxiv</span>

view, the Upanishads, which still show these rudera of the ancient
temples, would have to be considered as more primitive even than those
in which the idea of the Brahman or the Highest Self has reached its
utmost purity.

It has been considered a very strong argument in support of the modern
and sectarian character of the *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad, that 'it
inculcates what is called Bhakti <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md), or
implicit reliance on the favour of the deity worshipped.' Now it is
quite true that this Upanishad possesses a very distinct character of
its own, by the stress which it lays on the personal, and sometimes
almost mythical character of the Supreme Spirit; but, so far from
inculcating bhakti, in the modern sense of the word, it never mentions
that word, except in the very last verse, a verse which, if necessary,
certain critics would soon dispose of as a palpable addition. But that
verse says no more than this: 'If these truths (of the Upanishad) have
been told to a high-minded man, who feels the highest devotion for God,
and for his Guru as for God, then they will shine forth indeed.' Does
that prove the existence of Bhakti as we find it in the
Sâ*nd*ilya-sûtras <span id="fr_36"></span>[2](#fn_36.md)?

Again, it has been said that the *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad is sectarian
in a philosophical sense, that it is in fact an Upanishad of the Sâṅkhya
system of philosophy, and not of the Vedânta. Now I am quite willing to
admit that, in its origin, the Vedânta philosophy is nearer to the Vedic
literature than any other of the six systems of philosophy, and that if
we really found doctrines, peculiar to the Sâṅkhya, and opposed to the
Vedânta, in the *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad, we might feel inclined to
assign to our Upanishad a later date. But where is the proof of this?

No doubt there are expressions in this Upanishad which remind us of
technical terms used at a later time in the Sâṅkhya system of
philosophy, but of Sâṅkhya doctrines, which I had myself formerly
suspected in this Upanishad,

<span id="page_xxxv">p. xxxv</span>

I can on closer study find very little. I think it was Mr. Gough who, in
his Philosophy of the Upanishads, for the first time made it quite clear
that the teaching of our Upanishad is, in the main, the same as that of
the other Upanishads. 'The *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad teaches,' as he
says, 'the unity of souls in the one and only Self; the unreality of the
world as a series of figments of the self-feigning world-fiction; and as
the first of the fictitious emanations, the existence of the Demiurgos
or universal soul present in every individual soul, the deity that
projects the world out of himself, that the migrating souls may find the
recompense of their works in former lives.'

I do not quite agree with this view of the Î*s*vara, whom Mr. Gough
calls the Demiurgos, but he seems to me perfectly right when he says
that the *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad propounds in Sâṅkhya terms the very
principles that the Sâṅkhya philosophers make it their business to
subvert. One might doubt as to the propriety of calling certain terms
'Sâṅkhya terms' in a work written at a time when a Sâṅkhya philosophy,
such as we know it as a system, had as yet no existence, and when the
very name Sâṅkhya meant something quite different from the Sâṅkhya
system of Kapila. Sâṅkhya is derived from saṅkhyâ, and that meant
counting, number, name, corresponding very nearly to the Greek λόγος.
Sâṅkhya, as derived from it, meant originally no more than theoretic
philosophy, as opposed to yoga, which meant originally practical
religious exercises and penances, to restrain the passions and the
senses in general. All other interpretations of these words, when they
had become technical names, are of later date.

But even in their later forms, whatever we may think of the coincidences
and differences between the Sâṅkhya and Vedânta systems of philosophy,
there is one point on which they are diametrically opposed. Whatever
else the Sâṅkhya may be, it is dualistic; whatever else the Vedânta may
be, it is monistic. In the Sâṅkhya, nature, or whatever else we may call
it, is independent of the purusha; in the Vedânta it is not. Now the
*S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad states distinctly that nature, or what in the
Sâṅkhya philosophy

<span id="page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</span>

is intended by Pradhâna, is not an independent power, but a power
(*s*akti) forming the very self of the Deva. 'Sages,' we read, 'devoted
to meditation and concentration, have seen the power belonging to God
himself, hidden in its own qualities.'

What is really peculiar in the *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad is the strong
stress which it lays on the personality of the Lord, the Î*s*vara, Deva,
in the passage quoted, is perhaps the nearest approach to our own idea
of a personal God, though without the background which the Vedânta
always retains for it. It is God as creator and ruler of the world, as
îsvara, lord, but not as Paramâtman, or the Highest Self. The Paramâtman
constitutes, no doubt, his real essence, but creation and creator have a
phenomenal character only <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md). The
creation is mâyâ, in its original sense of work, then of phenomenal
work, then of illusion. The creator is mâyin, in its original sense of
worker or maker, but again, in that character, phenomenal only <span
id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38.md). The Gunas or qualities arise, according
to the Vedânta, from prakriti or mâyâ, within, not beside, the Highest
Self, and this is the very idea which is here expressed by 'the
Self-power of God, hidden in the gunas or determining qualities.' How
easily that sakti or power may become an independent being, as Mâyâ, we
see in such verses as:

Sarvabhûteshu sarvâtman yâ *s*aktir aparâbhavâ  
Gu*n*â*s*rayâ namas tasyai *s*a*s*vatâyai pare*s*vara <span
id="fr_39"></span>[3](#fn_39.md).

But the important point is this, that in the *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad
this change has not taken place. Throughout the whole of it we have one
Being only, as the cause of everything, never two. Whatever Sâṅkhya
philosophers of a later date may have imagined that they could discover
in that Upanishad in support of their theories <span
id="fr_40"></span>[4](#fn_40.md), there is not one passage in it which, if
rightly interpreted, not by itself, but in connection with the whole
text, could be quoted in

<span id="page_xxxvii">p. xxxvii</span>

support of a dualistic philosophy such as the Sâṅkhya, as a system,
decidedly is.

If we want to understand, what seems at first sight contradictory, the
existence of a God, a Lord, a Creator, a Ruler, and at the same time the
existence of the super-personal Brahman, we must remember that the
orthodox view of the Vedânta <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) is not
what we should call Evolution, but Illusion. Evolution of the Brahman,
or Pari*n*âma, is heterodox, illusion or Vivarta is orthodox Vedânta.
Brahman is a concept involving such complete perfection that with it
evolution, or a tendency towards higher perfection, is impossible. If
therefore there is change, that change can only be illusion, and can
never claim the same reality as Brahman. To put it metaphorically, the
world, according to the orthodox Vedântin, does not proceed from Brahman
as a tree from a germ, but as a mirage from the rays of the sun. The
world is, as we express it, phenomenal only, but whatever objective
reality there is in it, is Brahman, 'das Ding an sich,' as Kant might
call it.

Then what is Î*s*vara, or Deva, the Lord or God? The answers given to
this question are not very explicit. Historically, no doubt, the idea of
the Î*s*vara, the personal God, the creator and ruler, the omniscient
and omnipotent, existed before the idea of the absolute Brahman, and
after the idea of the Brahman had been elaborated, the difficulty of
effecting a compromise between the two ideas, had to be overcome.
Î*s*vara, the Lord, is Brahman, for what else could he be? But he is
Brahman under a semblance, the semblance, namely, of a personal creating
and governing God. He is not created, but is the creator, an office too
low, it was supposed, for Brahman. The power which enabled Î*s*vara to
create, was a power within him, not independent of him, whether we call
it Devâtmasakti, Mâyâ, or Prakriti. That power is really inconceivable,
and it has assumed such different forms in the mind of different
Vedântists, that in the end Mâyâ herself is represented as the creating
power, nay, as having created Î*s*vara himself.

<span id="page_xxxviii">p. xxxviii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In our Upanishad,
however, Î*s*vara is the creator, and though, philosophically speaking,
we should say that be was conceived as phenomenal, yet we must never
forget that the phenomenal is the form of the real, and Î*s*vara
therefore an aspect of Brahman <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md).
'This God,' says Pramâda Dâsa Mitra <span id="fr_43"></span>[2](#fn_43.md),
'is the spirit conscious of the universe. Whilst an extremely limited
portion, and that only of the material universe, enters into my
consciousness, the whole of the conscious universe, together, of course,
with the material one that hangs upon it, enters into the consciousness
of God.' And again, 'Whilst we (the *g*îvâtmans) are subject to Mâyâ,
Mâyâ is subject to Î*s*vara. If we truly know Î*s*vara, we know him as
Brahman; if we truly know ourselves, we know ourselves as Brahman. This
being so, we must not be surprised if sometimes we find Î*s*vara sharply
distinguished from Brahman, whilst at other times Î*s*vara, and Brahman
are interchanged.'

Another argument in support of the sectarian character of the
*S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad is brought forward, not by European students
only, but by native scholars, namely, that the very name of Kapila, the
reputed founder of the Sâṅkhya philosophy, occurs in it. Now it is quite
true that if we read the second verse of the fifth Adhyâya by itself,
the occurrence of the word Kapila may seem startling. But if we read it
in connection with what precedes and follows, we shall see hardly
anything unusual in it. It says:

'It is he who, being one only, rules over every germ (cause), over all
forms, and over all germs; it is he who, in the beginning, bears in his
thoughts the wise son, the fiery, whom he wished to look on while he was
born.'

Now it is quite clear to me that the subject in this verse is the same
as in IV, II, where the same words are used, and where yo yoni*m* yonim
adhitish*th*aty eka*h* refers clearly to Brahman. It is equally clear
that the prasûta, the son, the offspring of Brahman, in the Vedânta
sense, can only be the same person who is elsewhere called
Hira*n*yagarbha,

<span id="page_xxxix">p. xxxix</span>

the personified Brahman. Thus we read before, III, 4, 'He the creator
and supporter of the gods, Rudra, the great seer (maharshi), the lord of
all, formerly gave birth to Hira*n*yagarbha;' and in IV, 11, we have the
very expression which is used here, namely, 'that he saw Hira*n*yagarbha
being born.' Unfortunately, a new adjective is applied in our verse to
Hira*n*yagarbha, namely, kapila, and this has called forth
interpretations totally at variance with the general tenor of the
Upanishad. If, instead of kapilam, reddish, fiery <span
id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md), any other epithet had been used of
Hira*n*yagarbha, no one, I believe, would have hesitated for a moment to
recognise the fact that our text simply repeats the description of
Hira*n*yagarbha in his relation to Brahman, for the other epithet
*ri*shim, like maharshim, is too often applied to Brahman himself and to
Hira*n*yagarbha to require any explanation.

But it is a well known fact that the Hindus, even as early as the
Brâhma*n*a-period, were fond of tracing their various branches of
knowledge back to Brahman or to Brahman Svayambhû and then through
Pra*g*âpati, who even in the Rig-veda (X, 121, 10) replaces
Hira*n*yagarbha, and sometimes through the Devas, such as Mrityu, Vâyu,
Indra, Agni <span id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md), &c., to the various
ancestors of their ancient families.

In the beginning of the Mu*nd*akopanishad we are told that Brahman told
it to Atharvan, Atharvan to Aṅgir, Aṅgir to Satyavâha Bhâradvâga,
Bhâradvâga to Aṅgiras, Aṅgiras to *S*aunaka. Manu, the ancient lawgiver,
is called both Haira*n*yagarbha and Svâyambhuva, as descended from
Svâyambhu or from Hira*n*yagarbha <span id="fr_46"></span>[3](#fn_46.md).
Nothing therefore was more natural than that the same tendency should
have led some one to assign the authorship of a great philosophical
system like the Sâṅkhya to Hira*n*yagarbha, if not to Brahman Svayambhû.
And if the name of Hira*n*yagarbha had been used already for the
ancestors of other sages, and the inspirers of other systems, what could
be more natural than that another name of the same Hira*n*yagarbha

<span id="page_xl">p. xl</span>

should be chosen, such as Kapila. If we are told that Kapila handed his
knowledge to Âsuri, Âsuri to Pa*ñk*a*s*ikha, this again is in perfect
keeping with the character of literary tradition in India. Âsuri occurs
in the Va*m*sas of the *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a (see above, pp. 187, 226);
Pa*ñk*asikha <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md), having five tufts,
might be either a general name or a proper name of an ascetic, Buddhist
or otherwise. He is quoted in the Sâṅkhya-sûtras, V, 32; VI, 68.

But after all this was settled, after Kapila had been accepted, like
Hira*n*yagarbha, as the founder of a great system of philosophy, there
came a reaction. People had now learnt to believe in a real Kapila, and
when looking out for credentials for him, they found them wherever the
word Kapila occurred in old writings. The question whether there ever
was a real historical person who took the name of Kapila and taught the
Sâṅkhya-sûtras, does not concern us here. I see no evidence for it. What
is instructive is this, that our very passage, which may have suggested
at first the name of Kapila, as distinct from Hira*n*yagarbha, Kapila,
was later on appealed to to prove the primordial existence of a Kapila,
the founder of the Sâṅkhya philosophy. However, it requires but a very
slight acquaintance with Sanskrit literature and very little reflection
in order to see that the author of our verse could never have dreamt of
elevating a certain Kapila, known to him as a great philosopher, if
there ever was such a man, to a divine rank <span
id="fr_48"></span>[2](#fn_48.md). Hira*n*yagarbha kapila may have given
birth to Kapila, the hero of the Sâṅkhya philosophers, but Kapila, a
real human person, was never changed into Hira*n*yagarbha kapila.

Let us see now what the commentators say. *S*aṅkara first explains
kapilam by kanaka*m* <span id="fr_49"></span>[3](#fn_49.md) kapilavar*n*am
. . . . Hira*n*yagarbham. Kapilo 'gra*g*a iti purâ*n*ava*k*anât. Kapilo
Hira*n*yagarbho vâ nirdi*s*yate. But he afterwards quotes some verses in
support of the theory that Kapila was a

<span id="page_xli">p. xli</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Paramarshi, a
portion of Vish*n*u, intended to destroy error in the K*ri*ta Yuga, a
teacher of the Sâṅkhya philosophy.

Vigñânâtman explains the verse rightly, and without any reference to
Kapila, the Sâṅkhya teacher.

*S*aṅkarânanda goes a step further, and being evidently fully aware of
the misuse that had been made of this passage, even in certain passages
of the Mahâbhârata (XII, 13254, 13703), and elsewhere, declares
distinctly that kapila cannot be meant for the teacher of the Sâṅkhya
(na tu sâṅkhyapra*n*etâ kapila*h*, nâmamâtrasâmyena tadgraha*n*e syâd
atiprasaṅga*h*). He is fully aware of the true interpretation, viz.
avyâk*ri*tasya prathamakâryabhûta*m* kapila*m* vi*k*itravar*n*a*m*
*gñ*ânakriyâ*s*aktyâtmaka*m* Hira*n*yagarbham ityarthah, but he yields
to another temptation, and seems to prefer another view which makes
Kapila Vâsudevasyâvatârabûta*m* Sagaraputrâ*n*â*m* dagdhâram, an Avatâra
of Vâsudeva, the burner of the sons of Sagara. What vast conclusions may
be drawn from no facts, may be seen in Weber's Indische Studien, vol. i,
p. 430, and even in his History of Indian Literature, published in 1878.

Far more difficult to explain than these supposed allusions to the
authors and to the teaching of the Sâṅkhya philosophy are the frequent
references in the *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad to definite numbers, which
are supposed to point to certain classes of subjects as arranged in the
Sâṅkhya and other systems of philosophy. The Sâṅkhya philosophy is fond
of counting and arranging, and its very name is sometimes supposed to
have been chosen because it numbers (sankhyâ) the subjects of which it
treats. It is certainly true that if we meet, as we do in the
*S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad, with classes of things <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md), numbered as one, two, three, five, eight,
sixteen, twenty, forty-eight, fifty and more, and if some of these
numbers agree with those recognised in the later Sâṅkhya and Yoga
systems, we feel doubtful as to whether these coincidences are
accidental, or whether, if not accidental, they are due to borrowing on
the part of those later systems, or on the part

<span id="page_xlii">p. xlii</span>

it impossible to come to a decision on this point. Even so early as the
hymns of the Rig-veda we meet with these numbers assigned to days and
months and seasons, rivers and countries, sacrifices and deities. They
clearly prove the existence of a considerable amount of intellectual
labour which had become fixed and traditional before the composition of
certain hymns, and they prove the same in the case of certain
Upanishads. But beyond this, for the present, I should not like to go;
and I must say that the attempts of most of the Indian commentators at
explaining such numbers by a reference to later systems of philosophy or
cosmology, are generally very forced and unsatisfactory.

One more point I ought to mention as indicating the age of the
*S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad, and that is the obscurity of many of its
verses, which may be due to a corruption of the text, and the number of
various readings, recognised as such, by the commentators. Some of them
have been mentioned in the notes to my translation.

The text of this Upanishad was printed by Dr. Roer in the Bibliotheca
Indica, with *S*aṅkara's commentary. I have consulted besides, the
commentary of Vi*gñ*ânâtman, the pupil of
Paramaha*m*sa-parivrâ*g*akâ*k*ârya-*s*rîmag-*Gñ*ânotta-mâ*k*ârya, MS. I.
O. 1133; and a third commentary, by *S*aṅkarânanda, the pupil of
Paramaha*m*sa-parivrâ*g*akâ*k*âryânandâtman, MS. I. O. 1878. These were
kindly lent me by Dr. Rost, the learned and liberal librarian of the
India Office.
