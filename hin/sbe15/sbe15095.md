### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_597"></span>[3](#fn_597.md).

1\. *S*vetaketu Âru*n*eya went to the settlement of the Pa*ñk*âlas. He
came near to Pravâha*n*a *G*aivali <span
id="fr_598"></span>[4](#fn_598.md), who was walking about (surrounded by
his men). As soon as he (the king) saw him, he said: 'My boy!'
*S*vetaketu replied: 'Sir!'

Then the king said: 'Have you been taught by your father!' 'Yes,' he
replied.

2\. The king said: 'Do you know how men, when they depart from here,
separate from each other?' 'No,' he replied.

'Do you know how they come back to this world?' 'No,' he replied <span
id="fr_599"></span>[5](#fn_599.md).

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

'Do you know how that world does never become full with the many who
again and again depart thither?' 'No,' he replied.

'Do you know at the offering of which libation the waters become endowed
with a human voice and rise and speak?' 'No,' he replied.

'Do you know the access to the path leading to the Devas and to the path
leading to the Fathers, i.e. by what deeds men gain access to the path
leading to the Devas or to that leading to the Fathers? For we have
heard even the saying of a *Ri*shi: "I heard of two paths for men, one
leading to the Fathers, the other leading to the Devas. On those paths
all that lives moves on, whatever there is between father (sky) and
mother (earth)."'

*S*vetaketu said: 'I do not know even one of all these questions.'

3\. Then the king invited him to stay and accept his hospitality. But
the boy, not caring for hospitality, ran away, went back to his father,
and said: 'Thus then you called me formerly well-instructed!' The father
said: 'What then, you sage?' The son replied: 'That fellow of a
Râ*g*anya asked me five questions, and I did not know one of them.'

'What were they?' said the father.

'These were they,' the son replied, mentioning the different heads.

4\. The father said: 'You know me, child, that whatever I know, I told
you. But come, we shall go thither, and dwell there as students.'

'You may go, Sir,' the son replied.

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

Then Gautama went where (the place of) Pravâha*n*a Gaivali was, and the
king offered him a seat, ordered water for him, and gave him the proper
offerings. Then he said to him: 'Sir, we offer a boon to Gautama.'

5\. Gautama said: 'That boon is promised to me; tell me the same speech
which you made in the presence of my boy.'

6\. He said: 'That belongs to divine boons, name one of the human
boons.'

7\. He said: 'You know well that I have plenty of gold, plenty of cows,
horses, slaves, attendants, and apparel; do not heap on me <span
id="fr_600"></span>[1](#fn_600.md) what I have already in plenty, in
abundance, and superabundance.'

The king said: 'Gautama, do you wish (for instruction from me) in the
proper way?'

Gautama replied: 'I come to you as a pupil.'

In word only have former sages (though Brahmans) come as pupils (to
people of lower rank), but Gautama actually dwelt as a pupil (of
Pravâha*n*a, who was a Râ*g*anya) in order to obtain the fame of having
respectfully served his master <span id="fr_601"></span>[2](#fn_601.md).

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

8\. The king said: 'Do not be offended with us, neither you nor your
forefathers, because this knowledge has before now never dwelt with any
Brâhma*n*a <span id="fr_602"></span>[1](#fn_602.md). But I shall tell it to
you, for who could refuse you when you speak thus?

9\. 'The altar (fire), O Gautama, is that world (heaven) <span
id="fr_603"></span>[2](#fn_603.md); the fuel is the sun itself, the smoke
his rays, the light the day, the coals the quarters, the sparks the
intermediate quarters. On that altar the Devas offer the *s*raddhâ
libation (consisting of water <span id="fr_604"></span>[3](#fn_604).md).
From that oblation rises Soma, the king (the moon).

10\. 'The altar, O Gautama, is Par*g*anya (the god of rain); the fuel is
the year itself, the smoke the clouds, the light the lightning, the
coals the thunderbolt, the sparks the thunderings. On that altar the
Devas offer Soma, the king (the moon). From that oblation rises rain.

11\. 'The altar, O Gautama, is this world <span
id="fr_605"></span>[4](#fn_605.md); the fuel is the earth itself, the smoke
the fire, the light the night, the coals the moon, the sparks the stars.
On that altar the Devas offer rain. From that oblation rises food.

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

12\. 'The altar, O Gautama, is man; the fuel the opened mouth, the smoke
the breath, the light the tongue, the coals the eye, the sparks the ear.
On that altar the Devas offer food. From that oblation rises seed.

13\. 'The altar, O Gautama, is woman <span
id="fr_606"></span>[1](#fn_606.md). On that altar the Devas offer seed.
From that oblation rises man. He lives so long as he lives, and then
when he dies,

14\. 'They take him to the fire (the funeral pile), and then the
altar-fire is indeed fire, the fuel fuel, the smoke smoke, the
light light, the coals coals, the sparks sparks. In that very altar-fire
the Devas offer man, and from that oblation man rises, brilliant in
colour.

15\. 'Those who thus know this (even G*ri*hasthas), and those who in the
forest worship faith and the True <span id="fr_607"></span>[2](#fn_607.md)
(Brahman Hira*n*yagarbha), go to light (ar*k*is), from light to day,
from day to the increasing half, from the increasing half to the six
months when the sun goes to the north, from those six months to the
world of the Devas (Devaloka), from the world of the Devas to the sun,
from the sun to the place of lightning. When they have thus reached the
place of lightning a spirit <span id="fr_608"></span>[3](#fn_608.md) comes
near them, and leads them to the worlds of the (conditioned) Brahman. In
these worlds of Brahman they dwell exalted for ages. There is no
returning for them.

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

16\. 'But they who conquer the worlds (future states) by means of
sacrifice, charity, and austerity, go to smoke, from smoke to night,
from night to the decreasing half of the moon, from the decreasing half
of the moon to the six months when the sun goes to the south, from these
months to the world of the fathers, from the world of the fathers to the
moon. Having reached the moon, they become food, and then the Devas feed
on them there, as sacrificers feed on Soma, as it increases and
decreases <span id="fr_609"></span>[1](#fn_609.md). But when this (the
result of their good works on earth) ceases, they return again to that
ether, from ether to the air, from the air to rain, from rain to the
earth. And when they have reached the earth, they become food, they are
offered again in the altar-fire, which is man (see § 11), and thence are
born in the fire of woman. Thus they rise up towards the worlds, and go
the same round as before.

'Those, however, who know neither of these two paths, become worms,
birds,, and creeping things.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_597"></span>[204:3](sbe15095.htm#fr_597.md) See *Kh*ând. Up.
V, 3; Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, I, 433; Deussen, Vedânta, p. 390.
The commentator treats this chapter as a supplement, to explain the ways
that lead to the pit*ri*loka and the devaloka.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[204:4](sbe15095.htm#fr_598.md) The MSS. I. O. 375
and 1973 give *G*aivali, others *G*aibali. He is a Kshatriya sage, who
appears also in *Kh*ând. Up. I, 8, 1, as silencing Brâhma*n*as.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[204:5](sbe15095.htm#fr_599.md) The same question
is repeated in Roer's edition, only substituting <span id="page_205">p.
205</span> sampadyante for âpadyante. The MSS. I. O. 375 and 1973 do not
support this.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[206:1](sbe15095.htm#fr_600.md) Abhyavadânya is
explained as niggardly, or unwilling to give, and derived from vadânya,
liberal, a-vadânya, illiberal, and abhi, towards. This, however, is an
impossible form in Sanskrit. Vadânya means liberal, and stands for
avadânya, this being derived from avadâna, lit. what is cut off, then a
morsel, a gift. In abhyavadânya the original a reappears, so that
abhyavadânya means, not niggardly, but on the contrary, liberal, i.e.
giving more than is required. Avadânya has never been met with in the
sense of niggardly, and though a rule of Pâ*n*ini sanctions the
formation of a-vadânya, it does not say in what sense. Abhyavadâ in the
sense of cutting off in addition occurs in *S*atap. Br. II, 5, 2, 40;
avadâna*m* karoti, in the sense of making a present, occurs Maitr. Up.
VI, 33.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[206:2](sbe15095.htm#fr_601.md) The commentator
takes the opposite view. In times of distress, he says, former sages,
belonging to a higher caste, have <span id="page_207">p. 207</span>
submitted to become pupils to teachers of a lower caste, not, however,
in order to learn, but simply in order to live. Therefore Gautama also
becomes a pupil in name only, for it would be against all law to act
otherwise. See Gautama, Dharma-sûtras VII, i, ed, Stenzler; translated
by Bühler, p. 209.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[207:1](sbe15095.htm#fr_602.md) Here, too, my
translation is hypothetical, and differs widely from *S*aṅkara.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[207:2](sbe15095.htm#fr_603.md) Cf. *Kh*ând. Up.
V, 4.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[207:3](sbe15095.htm#fr_604.md) Deussen translates
In diesem Feuer opfern die Götter den Glauben.'

<span id="fn_605"></span>[207:4](sbe15095.htm#fr_605.md) Here a distinction
is made between aya*m* loka, this world, and p*ri*thivî, earth, while in
the *Kh*ând. Up. aya*m* loka is the earth, asau loka the heaven.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[208:1](sbe15095.htm#fr_606.md) Tasyâ upastha eva
samil, lomâni dhûmo, yonir ar*k*ir, yad anta*h*karoti te 'ṅgârâ,
abhinandâ visphuliṅgâ*h*.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[208:2](sbe15095.htm#fr_607.md) *S*aṅkara
translates, 'those who with faith worship the True,' and this seems
better.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[208:3](sbe15095.htm#fr_608.md) 'A person living
in the Brahma-world, sent forth, i.e. created, by Brahman, by the mind,'
*S*aṅkara. 'Der ist nicht wie ein Mensch,' Deussen, p. 392.

<span id="fn_609"></span>[209:1](sbe15095.htm#fr_609.md) See note 4 on
*Kh*ând. Up. V, 10, and Deussen, Vedânta, p. 393. *S*aṅkara guards
against taking âpyâyasvâpakshîyasva as a mantra. A similar construction
is *g*âyasva m*ri*yasva, see *Kh*ând. Up. V, 10, 8.
