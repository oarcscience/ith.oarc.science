Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. He (the knower of the Self) knows that highest home of Brahman <span
id="fr_186"></span>[2](#fn_186.md), in which all is contained and shines
brightly. The wise who, without desiring happiness, worship that
Person <span id="fr_187"></span>[3](#fn_187.md), transcend this seed, (they
are not born again.)

2\. He who forms desires in his mind, is born again through his desires
here and there. But to him whose desires are fulfilled and who is
conscious of the true Self (within himself) all desires vanish, even
here on earth.

3\. That Self <span id="fr_188"></span>[4](#fn_188.md) cannot be gained by
the Veda, nor by understanding, nor by much learning. He whom the Self
chooses, by him the Self can be gained. The Self chooses him (his body)
as his own.

4\. Nor is that Self to be gained by one who is destitute of strength,
or without earnestness, or without right meditation. But if a wise man
strives after it by those means (by strength, earnestness, and right
meditation), then his Self enters the home of Brahman.

5\. When they have reached him (the Self), the sages become satisfied
through knowledge, they are conscious of their Self, their passions have
passed

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

away, and they are tranquil. The wise, having reached Him who is
omnipresent everywhere, devoted to the Self, enter into him wholly.

6\. Having well ascertained the object of the knowledge of the
Vedânta <span id="fr_189"></span>[1](#fn_189.md), and having purified their
nature by the Yoga <span id="fr_190"></span>[2](#fn_190.md) of
renunciation, all anchorites, enjoying the highest immortality, become
free at the time of the great end (death) in the worlds of Brahmâ.

7\. Their fifteen parts <span id="fr_191"></span>[3](#fn_191.md) enter into
their elements, their Devas (the senses) into their (corresponding)
Devas <span id="fr_192"></span>[4](#fn_192.md). Their deeds and their Self
with all his knowledge become all one in the highest Imperishable.

8\. As the flowing rivers disappear in the sea <span
id="fr_193"></span>[5](#fn_193.md), losing their name and their form, thus
a wise man, freed from name and form, goes to the divine Person, who is
greater than the great <span id="fr_194"></span>[6](#fn_194.md).

9\. He who knows that highest Brahman, becomes even Brahman. In his race
no one is born ignorant of Brahman. He overcomes grief, he overcomes
evil; free from the fetters of the heart, he becomes immortal.

10\. And this is declared by the following *Rik*-verse: 'Let a man tell
this science of Brahman to those only who have performed all (necessary)
acts, who are versed in the Vedas, and firmly established in (the lower)
Brahman, who themselves offer as

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

an oblation the one *Ri*shi (Agni), full of faith, and by whom the rite
of (carrying fire on) the head has been performed, according to the rule
(of the Âtharva*n*as).'

11\. The *Ri*shi Aṅgiras formerly told this true (science <span
id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_195).md); a man who has not performed the
(proper) rites, does not read it. Adoration to the highest *Ri*shis!
Adoration to the highest *Ri*shis!
