Textual Heritage

### FIFTEENTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

1\.  <span id="fr_584"></span>[2](#fn_584)The face of the True (the
Brahman) is covered with a golden disk <span
id="fr_585"></span>[3](#fn_585). Open that, O Pûshan <span
id="fr_586"></span>[4](#fn_586), that we may see the nature of the
True <span id="fr_587"></span>[5](#fn_587).

2\. O Pûshan, only seer, Yama (judge), Sûrya (sun), son of
Pra*g*âpati <span id="fr_588"></span>[6](#fn_588), spread thy rays and
gather them!

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

The light which is thy fairest form, I see it. I am what he is (viz. the
person in the sun).

3\. Breath to air and to the immortal! Then this my body ends in ashes.
Om! Mind, remember! Remember thy deeds! Mind, remember! Remember thy
deeds <span id="fr_589"></span>[1](#fn_589)!

4\. Agni, lead us on to wealth (beatitude) by a good path <span
id="fr_590"></span>[2](#fn_590), thou, O God, who knowest all things!
Keep far from us crooked evil, and we shall offer thee the fullest
praise! (Rv. I, 189, 1.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_584"></span>[199:2](sbe15093.htm#fr_584) These verses,
which are omitted here in the Mâdhyandina text, are found at the end of
the Vâ*g*asaneyi-upanishad 15-18. They are supposed to be a prayer
addressed to Âditya by a dying person.

<span id="fn_585"></span>[199:3](sbe15093.htm#fr_585) Mahîdhara on verse
17: The face of the true (purusha in the sun), is covered by a golden
disk.' *S*aṅkara explains here mukha, face, by mukhya*m* svarûpam, the
principal form or nature.

<span id="fn_586"></span>[199:4](sbe15093.htm#fr_586) Pûshan is here
explained as a name of Savit*ri*, the sun; likewise all the names in the
next verse.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[199:5](sbe15093.htm#fr_587) Cf. Maitr. Up. VI,
35.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[199:6](sbe15093.htm#fr_588) Of Î*s*vara or
Hira*n*yagarbha.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[200:1](sbe15093.htm#fr_589) The
Vâ*g*asaneyi-sa*m*hitâ reads: Om, krato smara, *kli*be smara, k*ri*ta*m*
smara. Uva*t*a holds that Agni, fire, who has been worshipped in youth
and manhood, is here invoked in the form of mind, or that kratu is meant
for sacrifice. 'Agni, remember me 'Think of the world! Remember my
deeds!' K*li*be is explained by Mahîdhara as a dative of k*li*p, k*li*p
meaning loka, world, what is made to be enjoyed (kalpyate bhogâya).

<span id="fn_590"></span>[200:2](sbe15093.htm#fr_590) Not by the
Southern path, the dark, from which there is a fresh return to life.
