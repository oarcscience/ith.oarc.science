## SECOND VALLÎ,

## OR, THE CHAPTER ON ÂNANDA (BLISS).

Hari*h*, Om! May it (the Brahman) protect us both (teacher and pupil)!
May it enjoy us both! May we acquire strength together! May our
knowledge become bright! May we never quarrel! Peace! peace! peace <span

### FIRST ANUVÂKA.

He who knows the Brahman attains the highest (Brahman). On this the
following verse is recorded:

'He who knows Brahman, which is (i.e. cause, not effect), which is
conscious, which is without end, as hidden in the depth (of the heart),
in the highest ether, he enjoys all blessings, at one with the
omniscient Brahman.'

From that Self <span id="fr_213"></span>[2](#fn_213) (Brahman.md) sprang
ether (âkâ*s*a, that through which we hear); from ether air (that
through which we hear and feel); from air fire (that through which we
hear, feel, and see); from fire water (that through which we hear, feel,
see, and taste); from water earth (that through which we hear, feel,
see, taste, and smell). From earth herbs, from herbs food, from food
seed, from seed man. Man thus consists of the essence of food. This is
his head,

this his right arm, this his left arm, this his trunk (Âtman), this the
seat (the support) <span id="fr_214"></span>[1](sbe15035.htm#fn_214.md).

On this there is also the following *S*loka:
