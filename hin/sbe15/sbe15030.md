### NINTH ANUVÂKA <span id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_209).

1\. (What is necessary?) The night, and learning and practising the
Veda. The true, and learning and practising the Veda. Penance, and
learning and practising the Veda. Restraint, and learning and practising
the Veda. Tranquillity, and learning and practising the Veda. The fires
(to be consecrated), and learning and practising the Veda. The Agnihotra
sacrifice, and learning and practising the Veda. Guests (to be
entertained), and learning and practising the Veda. Man's duty, and
learning and practising the Veda. Children, and learning and practising
the Veda.

(1-6) Marriage, and learning and practising the Veda. Children's

Satyava*k*as Râthîtara thinks that the true only is necessary. Taponitya
Paura*s*ish*t*i thinks that penance only is necessary. Nâka Maudgalya
thinks that learning and practising the Veda only are necessary,--for
that is penance, that is penance.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_209"></span>[51:1](sbe15030.htm#fr_209) This chapter is
meant to show that knowledge alone, though it secures the highest
object, is not sufficient by itself, but must be preceded by works. The
learning of the Veda by heart and the practising of it so as not to
forget it again, these two must always have been previously performed.
