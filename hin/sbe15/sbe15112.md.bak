# Maitrâya*n*a-Brâhma*n*a-Upanishad

### FIRST PRAPÂTHAKA.

1\. The laying of the formerly-described sacrificial fires <span
id="fr_926"></span>[1](#fn_923.md) is indeed the sacrifice of Brahman.
Therefore let the sacrificer, after he has laid those fires, meditate on
the Self. Thus only does the sacrificer become complete and faultless.

But who is to be meditated on? He who is called Prâ*n*a (breath). Of him
there is this story:

2\. A King, named B*ri*hadratha, having established his son in his
sovereignty <span id="fr_927"></span>[2](#fn_924.md), went into the forest,
because he considered this body as transient, and had obtained freedom
from all desires. Having performed the highest penance, he stands there,
with uplifted arms, looking up to the sun. At the end of a thousand
(days) <span id="fr_928"></span>[3](#fn_925.md), the Saint Sâkâyanya <span
id="fr_929"></span>[4](#fn_926.md), who knew the Self, came near <span
id="fr_930"></span>[5](#fn_927.md), burning with splendour,

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

like a fire without smoke. He said to the King: 'Rise, rise! Choose a
boon!'

The King, bowing before him, said: 'O Saint, I know not the Self, thou
knowest the essence (of the Self). We have heard so. Teach it us.'

*S*âkâyanya replied: 'This was achieved of yore; but what thou askest is
difficult to obtain <span id="fr_931"></span>[1](#fn_928.md). O Aikshvâka,
choose other pleasures.'

The King, touching the Saint's feet with his head, recited this Gâthâ:

3\. 'O Saint, What is the use of the enjoyment of pleasures in this
offensive, pithless body--a mere mass of bones, skin, sinews,
marrow <span id="fr_932"></span>[2](#fn_929.md), flesh, seed, blood, mucus,
tears, phlegm, ordure, water <span id="fr_933"></span>[3](#fn_930.md),
bile, and slime! What is the use of the enjoyment of pleasures in this
body which is assailed by lust, hatred, greed, delusion, fear, anguish,
jealousy, separation from what is loved, union with what is not
loved <span id="fr_934"></span>[4](#fn_931.md), hunger, thirst, old age,
death, illness, grief, and other evils!

4\. And we see that all this is perishable, as these flies, gnats, and
other insects, as herbs and trees <span id="fr_935"></span>[5](#fn_932.md),

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

growing and decaying. And what of these? There are other great ones,
mighty wielders of bows, rulers of empires, Sudyumna, Bhûridyumna,
Indradyumna, Kuvalayâ*s*va, Yauvanâ*s*va, Vadhrya*s*va, A*s*vapati <span
id="fr_936"></span>[1](#fn_933.md), *S*a*s*abindu, Hari*sk*andra,
Ambarîsha <span id="fr_937"></span>[2](#fn_934.md), Nahusha, Anânata,
*S*aryâti, Yayâti, Anara*n*ya <span id="fr_938"></span>[3](#fn_935.md),
Ukshasena <span id="fr_939"></span>[4](#fn_936.md), &c., and kings such as
Marutta, Bharata (Daushyanti), and others, who before the eyes of their
whole family surrendered the greatest happiness, and passed on from this
world to that. And what of these? There are other great ones. We see the
destruction <span id="fr_940"></span>[5](#fn_937.md) of Gandharvas,
Asuras <span id="fr_941"></span>[6](#fn_938.md), Yakshas, Râkshasas,
Bhûtas, Ga*n*as, Pi*s*â*k*as, snakes, and vampires. And what of these?
There is the drying up of other great oceans, the falling of mountains,
the moving of the pole-star, the cutting of the wind-ropes (that hold
the stars), the submergence of the earth, and the departure of the gods
(suras) from their place. In such a world as this, what is the use of
the enjoyment of pleasures, if he who has fed <span
id="fr_942"></span>[7](#fn_939.md) on them is seen <span
id="fr_943"></span>[8](#fn_940) to return (to this world.md) again

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

and again! Deign therefore to take me out! In this world I am like a
frog in a dry well. O Saint, thou art my way, thou art my way.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_923"></span>[287:1](sbe15112.htm#fr_926.md) The performance of
all the sacrifices, described in the Maitrâya*n*a-brâhma*n*a, is to lead
up in the end to a knowledge of Brahman, by rendering a man fit for
receiving the highest knowledge. See Manu VI, 82: 'All that has been
declared (above) depends on meditation; for he who is not proficient in
the knowledge of the Self reaps not the full reward of the performance
of rites.'

<span id="fn_924"></span>[287:2](sbe15112.htm#fr_927.md) Instead of
virâ*g*ye, a doubtful word, and occurring nowhere else, m. reads
vairâ*g*ye.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[287:3](sbe15112.htm#fr_928.md) Or years, if we
read sahasrasya instead of sahasrâhasya.

<span id="fn_926"></span>[287:4](sbe15112.htm#fr_929.md) The descendant of
*S*âkâyana. Saint is perhaps too strong; it means a holy, venerable man,
and is frequently applied to a Buddha.

<span id="fn_927"></span>[287:5](sbe15112.htm#fr_930.md) Both M. and m. add
mune*h* before antikam, whereas the commentary has râ*gñ*a*h*.

<span id="fn_928"></span>[288:1](sbe15112.htm#fr_931.md) Though the
commentator must have read etad v*ri*ttam purastâd du*hs*akyam etat
pra*sñ*am, yet pra*sñ*am as a neuter is very strange. M. reads etad
v*ri*ttam purastât, du*ss*akama pri*kkh*a pra*sñ*am; m. reads etad
vratam purastâd a*s*akyam mâ pri*kh*a prasñam aikshvâka, &c. This
suggests the reading, etad v*ri*ttam purastâd du*hs*akam mi prikkha
pra*sñ*am, i.e. this was settled formerly, do not ask a difficult or an
impossible question.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[288:2](sbe15112.htm#fr_932.md) Read ma*gg*â.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[288:3](sbe15112.htm#fr_933.md) M. adds vâta
before pitta; not m.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[288:4](sbe15112.htm#fr_934.md) An expression that
often occurs in Buddhist literature. See also Manu VI, 62: 'On their
separation from those whom they love, and their union with those whom
they hate; on their strength overpowered by old age, and their bodies
racked with disease.'

<span id="fn_932"></span>[288:5](sbe15112.htm#fr_935.md) The Sandhi
vanaspatayodbhûta for vanaspataya udbhûta is anomalous. M. reads
vanaspatayo bhûtapradhva*m*sina*h*.

<span id="fn_933"></span>[289:1](sbe15112.htm#fr_936.md) M. carries on
a*s*vapati*s*a*s*abinduhari*sk*andrâmbarîsha.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[289:2](sbe15112.htm#fr_937.md) After Ambarîsha,
M. reads Nabhushânanutu*s*ayyâtiyayâtyanara*n*yâkshasenâdayo. Nahusha
(Naghusha?) is the father of *S*aryâti; Nâbhâga, the father of
Ambarîsha. These names are so carelessly written that even the
commentator says that the text is either *kh*ândasa or prâmâdika.
Anânata is a mere conjecture. It occurs as the name of a *Ri*shi in
*Ri*g-veda IX, 111.

<span id="fn_935"></span>[289:3](sbe15112.htm#fr_938.md) Anaranya,
mentioned in the Mahâbhârata, I, 230.

<span id="fn_936"></span>[289:4](sbe15112.htm#fr_939.md) M. reads
anara*n*yâkshasena.

<span id="fn_937"></span>[289:5](sbe15112.htm#fr_940.md) M. and m. read
nirodhanam.

<span id="fn_938"></span>[289:6](sbe15112.htm#fr_941.md) M. adds Apsarasas.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[289:7](sbe15112.htm#fr_942.md) AL and m. read
â*s*ritasya, but the commentator explains a*s*itasya.

<span id="fn_940"></span>[289:8](sbe15112.htm#fr_943.md) Here we have the
Maitrâya*n*a Sandhi, d*ris*yatâ iti, instead of d*ri*syata iti; see von
Schroeder, Maitrâya*n*î Sa*m*hitâ, p. xxviii. M. and m. read drisyata.
