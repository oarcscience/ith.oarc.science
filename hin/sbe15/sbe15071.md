### EIGHTH BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_414"></span>[2](#fn_414.md).

1\. Then Vâ*k*aknavî <span id="fr_415"></span>[3](#fn_415.md) said:
'Venerable Brâhma*n*as, I shall ask him two questions. If he will answer
them, none of you, I think, will defeat him in any argument concerning
Brahman.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'Ask, O Gârgî.'

2\. She said: 'O Yâ*gñ*avalkya, as the son of a warrior from the Kâ*s*îs
or Videhas might string his loosened bow, take two pointed foe-piercing
arrows in his hand and rise to do battle, I have risen to

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

fight thee with two questions. Answer me these questions.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'Ask, O Gârgî.'

3\. She said: 'O Yâ*gñ*avalkya, that of which they say that it is above
the heavens, beneath the earth, embracing heaven and earth <span
id="fr_416"></span>[1](#fn_416.md), past, present, and future, tell me in
what is it woven, like warp and woof?'

4\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'That of which they say that it is above the
heavens, beneath the earth, embracing heaven and earth, past, present,
and future, that is woven, like warp and woof, in the ether (âkâ*s*a).'

5\. She said: 'I bow to thee, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya, who hast solved me that
question. Get thee ready for the second.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said <span id="fr_417"></span>[2](#fn_417.md): 'Ask, O
Gârgî.'

6\. She said: 'O Yâ*gñ*avalkya, that of which they say that it is above
the heavens, beneath the earth, embracing heaven and earth, past,
present, and future, tell me in what is it woven, like warp and woof?'

7\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'That of which they say that it is above the
heavens, beneath the earth, embracing heaven and earth, past, present,
and future, that is woven, like warp and woof, in the ether.'

Gârgî said: 'In what then is the ether woven, like warp and woof?'

8\. He said: 'O Gârgî, the Brâhma*n*as call this the Akshara (the
imperishable). It is neither coarse nor fine, neither short nor long,
neither red (like fire) nor fluid (like water); it is without shadow,
without darkness, without air, without ether, without

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

attachment <span id="fr_418"></span>[1](#fn_418.md), without taste, without
smell, without eyes, without ears, without speech, without mind, without
light (vigour), without breath, without a mouth (or door), without
measure, having no within and no without, it devours nothing, and no one
devours it.'

9\. 'By the command of that Akshara (the imperishable), O Gârgî, sun and
moon stand apart <span id="fr_419"></span>[2](#fn_419.md). By the command
of that Akshara, O Gârgî, heaven and earth stand apart. By the command
of that Akshara, O Gârgî, what are called moments (nimesha), hours
(muhûrta), days and nights, half-months, months, seasons, years, all
stand apart. By the command of that Akshara, O Gârgî, some rivers flow
to the East from the white mountains, others to the West, or to any
other quarter. By the command of that Akshara, O Gârgî, men praise those
who give, the gods follow the sacrificer, the fathers the
Darvî-offering.'

10\. 'Whosoever, O Gârgî, without knowing that Akshara (the
imperishable), offers oblations in this world, sacrifices, and performs
penance for a thousand years, his work will have an end. Whosoever, O
Gargî, without knowing this Akshara, departs this world, he is miserable
(like a slave) <span id="fr_420"></span>[3](#fn_420.md). But he, O Gârgî,
who departs this world, knowing this Akshara, he is a Brâhma*n*a.'

11\. 'That Brahman,' O Gârgî, 'is unseen, but seeing; unheard, but
hearing; unperceived, but perceiving; unknown, but knowing. There is
nothing

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

that sees but it, nothing that hears but it, nothing that perceives but
it, nothing that knows but it. In that Akshara then, O Gârgî, the ether
is woven, like warp and woof.'

12\. Then said Gargî: 'Venerable Brâhmans, you may consider it a great
thing, if you get off by bowing before him. No one, I believe, will
defeat him in any argument concerning Brahman.' After that Vâka*k*navî
held her peace.
