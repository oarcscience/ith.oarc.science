<p><I>G</I>anaka Vaideha said: 'What is the nature of that knowledge?'</p>  
<p>Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya replied: 'Your Majesty, speech itself (is knowledge). For through speech, Your Majesty, a friend is known (to be a friend), and likewise the <I>Ri</I>g-Veda, Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, S&acirc;ma-veda, the Atharv&acirc;&#7749;girasas, the Itih&acirc;sa (tradition), Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a-vidy&acirc; (knowledge of the past), the Upanishads, <I>S</I>lokas (verses), S&ucirc;tras (rules), Anuvy&acirc;khy&acirc;nas and Vy&acirc;khy&acirc;nas (commentaries&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_462"></A><A HREF="#fn_462"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, &amp;c.); what is sacrificed, what is poured out, what is (to be) eaten and drunk, this world and the other world, and all creatures.

Speech does not desert him who worships that (Brahman) with such knowledge, all creatures approach him, and having become a god, he goes to the gods.'</p>
