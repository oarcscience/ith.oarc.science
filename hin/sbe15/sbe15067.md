### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_401"></span>[2](#fn_401.md).

1\. Then Ushasta Kâkrâya*n*a asked. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'tell me
the Brahman which is visible, not invisible <span
id="fr_402"></span>[3](#fn_402), the Self (âtman.md), who is within all.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'This, thy Self, who is within all.'

'Which Self, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya, is within all?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'He who breathes in the up-breathing, he is thy
Self, and within all. He who breathes in the down-breathing, he is thy
Self, and within all. He who breathes in the on-breathing, he is thy
Self, and within all. He who breathes in

the out-breathing, he is thy Self, and within all. This is thy Self, who
is within all.'

2\. Ushasta Kâkrâya*n*a said: 'As one might say, this is a cow, this is
a horse, thus has this been explained by thee. Tell me the Brahman which
is visible, not invisible, the Self, who is within all.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'This, thy Self, who is within all.'

'Which Self, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya, is within all?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'Thou couldst not see the (true) seer of sight,
thou couldst not hear the (true) hearer of hearing, nor perceive the
perceiver of perception, nor know the knower of knowledge. This is thy
Self, who is within all. Everything also is of evil.' After that Ushasta
Kâkrâya*n*a held his peace.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_401"></span>[128:2](sbe15067.htm#fr_401.md) Mâdhyandina text,
p. 1071. It follows after what is here the fifth Brâhma*n*a, treating of
Kaho*d*a Kaushîtakeya.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[128:3](sbe15067.htm#fr_402.md) Deussen, Vedanta,
p. 163, translates, 'das immanente, nicht transcendente Brahman,' which
is right, but too modern.
