## SECOND MU*ND*AKA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. This is the truth. As from a blazing fire sparks, being like unto
fire <span id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_173), fly forth a thousandfold,
thus are various beings brought forth from the Imperishable, my friend,
and return thither also.

2\. That heavenly Person is without body, he is both without and within,
not produced, without breath and without mind, pure, higher than the
high Imperishable <span id="fr_174"></span>[2](#fn_174).

3\. From him (when entering on creation) is born breath, mind, and all
organs of sense, ether, air, light, water, and the earth, the support of
all.

4\. Fire (the sky) is his head, his eyes the sun and the moon, the
quarters his ears, his speech the Vedas disclosed, the wind his breath,
his heart the universe; from his feet came the earth; he is indeed the
inner Self of all things <span id="fr_175"></span>[3](#fn_175).

5\. From him comes Agni (fire) <span id="fr_176"></span>[4](#fn_176),
the sun being the fuel; from the moon (Soma) comes rain (Par*g*anya);
from the earth herbs; and man gives seed unto the woman. Thus many
beings are begotten from the Person (purusha).

6\. From him come the *Rik*, the Sâman, the

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ya*g*ush, the
Dîkshâ (initiatory rites), all sacrifices and offerings of animals, and
the fees bestowed on priests, the year too, the sacrificer, and the
worlds, in which the moon shines brightly and the sun.

7\. From him the many Devas too are begotten, the Sâdhyas (genii), men,
cattle, birds, the up and down breathings, rice and corn (for
sacrifices), penance, faith, truth, abstinence, and law.

8\. The seven senses (prâ*n*a) also spring from him, the seven lights
(acts of sensation), the seven kinds of fuel (objects by which the
senses are lighted), the seven sacrifices (results of sensation), these
seven worlds (the places of the senses, the worlds determined by the
senses) in which the senses move, which rest in the cave (of the heart),
and are placed there seven and seven.

9\. Hence come the seas and all the mountains, from him flow the rivers
of every kind; hence come all herbs and the juice through which the
inner Self subsists with the elements.

10\. The Person is all this, sacrifice, penance, Brahman, the highest
immortal; he who knows this hidden in the cave (of the heart), he, O
friend, scatters the knot of ignorance here on earth.
