# INTRODUCTION.

THIS second volume completes the translation of the principal Upanishads
to which *S*aṅkara appeals in his great commentary on the
Vedânta-Sûtras <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0), viz.:

1\. *Kh*ândogya-upanishad,  
2. Talavakâra or Kena-upanishad,  
3. Aitareya-upanishad,  
4. Kaushîtaki-upanishad,  
5. Vâ*g*asaneyi or Î*s*â-upanishad,  
6. Ka*th*a-upanishad,  
7. Mu*nd*aka-upanishad,  
8. Taittirîyaka-upanishad,  
9. B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka-upanishad,  
10. *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad,  
11. Pra*sñ*a-upanishad.

These eleven have sometimes <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) been
called the old and genuine Upanishads, though I should be satisfied to
call them the eleven classical Upanishads, or the fundamental Upanishads
of the Vedânta philosophy.

Vidyâranya <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2), in his 'Elucidation of the
meaning of all the Upanishads,' Sarvopanishadarthânubhûti-prakâ*s*a,
confines himself likewise to those treatises, dropping, however, the
Î*s*â, and adding the Maitrâya*n*a-upanishad, of which I have given a
translation in this volume, and the
N*ri*si*m*hottara-tapanîya-upanishad, the translation of which had to be
reserved for the next volume.

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

It is more difficult to determine which of the Upanishads were chosen by
*S*aṅkara or deserving the honour of a special commentary. We possess
his commentaries on the eleven Upanishads mentioned before <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3), with the exception of the Kaushîtaki <span
id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4)-upanishad. We likewise possess his
commentary on the Mândûkya-upanishad, but we do not know for certain
whether he left commentaries on any of the other Upanishads. Some more
or less authoritative statements have been made that he wrote
commentaries on some of the minor Upanishads, such as the
Atharva*s*iras, Atharva-*s*ikhâ, and the N*ri*si*m*hatâpanî <span
id="fr_5"></span>[3](#fn_5). But as, besides *S*aṅkarâ*k*ârya, the
disciple of Govinda, there is *S*aṅkarânanda, the disciple of
Ânandâtman, another writer of commentaries on the Upanishads, it is
possible that the two names may have been confounded by less careful
copyists <span id="fr_6"></span>[4](#fn_6).

With regard to the N*ri*si*m*hatâpanî all uncertainty might seem to be
removed, after Professor Râmamaya Tarkaratna has actually published its
text with the commentary of *S*aṅkarâkârya in the Bibliotheca Indica,
Calcutta, 1871. But some uncertainty still remains. While at the end of
each Khanda of the N*ri*si*m*ha-pûrvatâpanî we read that the Bhâshya was
the work of the Paramaha*m*sa-parivrâ*g*akâ*k*ârya *S*rî-*S*aṅkara, the
pupil of Govinda, we have no such information for the
N*ri*si*m*ha-uttaratâpanî, but are told on the contrary that the words
*S*rî-Govindabhagavat &c. have been added at the end by the editor,
because he thought fit to do so. This is, to say the least, very
suspicious, and we must wait for further confirmation. There is another
commentary on this Upanishad by Nârâya*n*abha*tt*a, the son of Bha*tt*a
Ratnâkara <span id="fr_7"></span>[5](#fn_7), who is well known as the
author of Dîpikâs on several Upanishads.

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

I subjoin a list of thirty of the smaller Upanishads, published by
Professor Râmamaya Tarkaratna in the Bibliotheca Indica, with the
commentaries of Nârâya*n*abha*tt*a.

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

We owe to the same editor in the earlier numbers of the Bibliotheca the
following editions:

N*ri*si*m*hapûrvatâparî-upanishad, with commentary.  
N*ri*si*m*hottaratâpanî-upanishad, with commentary.  
Sha*tk*akra-upanishad, with commentary by Nârâyana.

Lastly, Hara*k*andra Vidyâbhûsha*n*a and Vi*s*vanâtha *S*âstrî have
published in the Bibliotheca Indica an edition of the
Gopâlatâpanî-upanishad, with commentary by Vi*s*ve*s*vara.

These editions of the text and commentaries of the Upanishads are no
doubt very useful, yet there are many passages where the text is
doubtful, still more where the commentaries leave us without any help.

Whatever other scholars may think of the difficulty of translating the
Upanishads, I can only repeat what I have said before, that I know of
few Sanskrit texts presenting more formidable problems to the translator
than these philosophical treatises. It may be said that most of them had
been translated before. No doubt they have been, and a careful
comparison of my own translation with those of my predecessors will
show, I believe, that a small advance, at all events, has now been made
towards a truer understanding of these ancient texts. But I know full
well how much still remains to be done, both in restoring a correct
text, and in discovering the original meaning of the Upanishads; and I
have again and again had to translate certain passages tentatively only,
or following the commentators, though conscious all the time that the
meaning which they extract from the text cannot be the right one.

As to the text, I explained in my preface to the first volume that I
attempted no more than to restore the text, such as it must have existed
at the time when *S*aṅkara wrote his commentaries. As *S*aṅkara lived
during the ninth century A*D*. <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8), and as
we possess no MSS. of so early a date, all reasonable demands of textual
criticism would thereby seem to be satisfied. Yet, this is not quite so.
We may draw such a line, and for the present keep within it, but
scholars who hereafter take up the study of the

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Upanishads will
probably have to go beyond. Where I had an opportunity of comparing
other commentaries, besides those of *S*aṅkara, it became quite clear
that they often followed a different text, and when, as in the case of
the Maitrâya*n*a-brâhma*n*a-upanishad, I was enabled to collate copies
which came from the South of India, the opinion which I have often
expressed of the great value of Southern MSS. received fresh
confirmation. The study of Grantha and other Southern MSS. will
inaugurate, I believe, a new period in the critical treatment of
Sanskrit texts, and the text of the Upanishads will, I hope, benefit
quite as much as later texts by the treasures still concealed in the
libraries of the Dekhan.

The rule which I have followed myself, and which I have asked my fellow
translators to follow, has been adhered to in this new volume also, viz.
whenever a choice has to be made between what is not quite faithful and
what is not quite English, to surrender without hesitation the idiom
rather than the accuracy of the translation. I know that all true
scholars have approved of this, and if some of our critics have been
offended by certain unidiomatic expressions occurring in our
translations, all I can say is, that we shall always be most grateful if
they would suggest translations which are not only faithful, but also
idiomatic. For the purpose we have in view, a rugged but faithful
translation seems to us more useful than a smooth but misleading one.

However, we have laid ourselves open to another kind of censure also,
namely, of having occasionally not been literal enough. It is impossible
to argue these questions in general, but every translator knows that in
many cases a literal translation may convey an entirely wrong meaning. I
shall give at least one instance.

My old friend, Mr. Nehemiah Goreh--at least I hope he will still allow
me to call him so--in the 'Occasional Papers on Missionary Subjects,'
First Series, No. 6, quotes, on p. 39, a passage from the
*Kh*ândogya-upanishad, translates it into English, and then remarks that
I had not translated it accurately. But the fault seems to me to lie

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

entirely with him, in attempting to translate a passage without
considering the whole chapter of which it forms a part. Mr. Nehemiah
Goreh states the beginning of the story rightly when he says that a
youth by name Svetaketu went, by the advice of his father, to a teacher
to study under him. After spending twelve years, as was customary, with
the teacher, when he returned home he appeared rather elated. Then the
father asked him:

Uta tam âde*s*am aprâksho <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9)
yenâ*s*ruta*m* *s*rutam bhavaty amatam matam avi*gñ*âta*m* vi*gñ*âtam
iti?

I translated this: 'Have you ever asked for that instruction by which we
hear what cannot be heard, by which we perceive what cannot be
perceived, by which we know what cannot be known?'

Mr. Nehemiah Goreh translates: 'Hast thou asked (of thy teacher) for
that instruction by which what is not heard becomes heard, what is not
comprehended becomes comprehended, what is not known becomes known?'

I shall not quarrel with my friend for translating man by to comprehend
rather than by to perceive. I prefer my own translation, because manas
is one side of the common sensory (anta*h*kara*n*a), buddhi, the other;
the original difference between the two being, so far as I can see, that
the manas originally dealt with percepts, the buddhi with concepts <span
id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10). But the chief difference on which my
critic lays stress is that I translated a*s*rutam, amatam, and
avi*gñ*âtam not by 'not heard, not comprehended, not known,' but by
'what cannot be heard, what cannot be perceived, what cannot be known.'

Now, before finding fault, why did he not ask himself what possible
reason I could have had for deviating from the original, and for
translating avigñâta by unknowable or

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

what cannot be known, rather than by unknown, as every one would be
inclined to translate these words at first sight? If he had done so, he
would have seen in a moment, that without the change which I introduced
in the idiom, the translation would not have conveyed the sense of the
original, nay, would have conveyed no sense at all. What could Svetaketu
have answered, if his father had asked him, whether he had not asked for
that instruction by which what is not heard becomes heard, what is not
comprehended becomes comprehended, what is not known becomes known? He
would have answered, 'Yes, I have asked for it; and from the first day
on which I learnt the *S*ikshâ, the A B C, I have every day heard
something which I had not heard before, I have comprehended something
which I had not comprehended before, I have known something which I had
not known before.' Then why does he say in reply, 'What is that
instruction?' Surely Mr. Nehemiah Goreh knew that the instruction which
the father refers to, is the instruction regarding Brahman, and that in
all which follows the father tries to lead his son by slow degrees to a
knowledge of Brahman <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11). Now that
Brahman is called again and again 'that which cannot be seen, cannot be
heard, cannot be perceived, cannot be conceived,' in the ordinary sense
of these words; can be learnt, in fact, from the Veda only <span
id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_12). It was in order to bring out this meaning
that I translated a*s*rutam not by 'not heard,' but by 'not hearable,'
or, in better English, by 'what cannot be heard <span
id="fr_13"></span>[3](#fn_13).'

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

Any classical scholar knows how often we must translate invictus by
invincible, and how Latin tolerates even invictissimus, which we could
never render in English by 'the most unconquered,' but 'the
unconquerable.' English idiom, therefore, and common sense required that
avi*gñ*âta should be translated, not by inconceived, but by
inconceivable, if the translation was to be faithful, and was to give to
the reader a correct idea of the original.

Let us now examine some other translations, to see whether the
translators were satisfied with translating literally, or whether they
attempted to translate thoughtfully.

Anquetil Duperron's translation, being in Latin, cannot help us much. He
translates: 'Non auditum, auditum fiat; et non scitum, scitum; et non
cognitum, cognitum.'

Rajendralal Mitra translates: 'Have you enquired of your tutor about
that subject which makes the unheard-of heard, the unconsidered
considered, and the unsettled settled?'

He evidently knew that Brahman was intended, but his rendering of the
three verbs is not exact.

Mr. Gough (p. 43) translates: 'Hast thou asked for that instruction by
which the unheard becomes heard, the unthought thought, the unknown
known?'

But now let us consult a scholar who, in a very marked degree, always
was a thoughtful translator, who felt a real interest in the subject,
and therefore was never satisfied with mere words, however plausible.
The late Dr. Ballantyne, in his translation of the Vedânta-Sâra <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14), had occasion to translate this passage
from the *Kh*ândogya-upanishad, and how did he translate it? 'The
eulogizing of the subject is the glorifying of what is set forth in this
or that section (of the Veda); as, for example, in that same section,
the sixth chapter of the *Kh*ândogya-upanishad, the glorifying of the
Real, besides whom there is nought else, in the following terms: "Thou,
O disciple, hast asked for that instruction whereby the unheard-of
becomes heard, the inconceivable

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

becomes conceived, and the unknowable becomes thoroughly known."'

Dr. Ballantyne therefore felt exactly what I felt, that in our passage a
strictly literal translation would be wrong, would convey no meaning, or
a wrong meaning; and Mr. Nehemiah Goreh will see that he ought not to
express blame, without trying to find out whether those whom he blames
for want of exactness, were not in reality more scrupulously exact in
their translation than he has proved himself to be.

Mr. Nehemiah Goreh has, no doubt, great advantages in interpreting the
Upanishads, and when he writes without any theological bias, his remarks
are often very useful. Thus he objects rightly, I think, to my
translation of a sentence in the same chapter of the
*Kh*ândogya-upanishad, where the father, in answer to his son's
question, replies: 'Sad eva, Somya, idam agra âsîd ekam evâdvitîyam.' I
had tried several translations of these words, and yet I see now that
the one I proposed in the end is liable to be misunderstood. I had
translated. 'In the beginning, my dear, there was that only which is,
one only, without a second.' The more faithful translation would have
been: 'The being alone was this in the beginning.' But 'the being' does
not mean in English that which is, τὸ ὄν, and therefore, to avoid any
misunderstanding, I translated 'that which is.' I might have said,
however, 'The existent, the real, the true (satyam) was this in the
beginning,' just as in the Aitareya-upanishad we read: 'The Self was all
this, one alone, in the beginning <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15).'
But in that case I should have sacrificed the gender, and this in our
passage is of great importance, being neuter, and not masculine.

What, however, is far more important, and where Mr. Nehemiah Goreh seems
to me to have quite misapprehended the original Sanskrit, is this, that
sat, τὸ ὄν, and âtmâ, the Self, are the subjects in these sentences, and
not predicates. Now Mr. Nehemiah Goreh translates: 'This was the
existent one itself before, one only without a second;' and he

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

explains: 'This universe, before it was developed in the present form,
was the existent one, Brahma, itself.' This cannot be. If 'idam,' this,
i.e. the visible world, were the subject, how could the Upanishad go on
and say, tad aikshata bahu syâm pra*g*âyeyeti tat te*g*o 's*ri*gata,
'that thought, may I be many, may I grow forth. It sent forth fire.'
This can be said of the Sat only, that is, the Brahman <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16). Sat, therefore, is the subject, not idam,
for a Vedântist may well say that Brahman is the world, or sent forth
the world, but not that the world, which is a mere illusion, was, in the
beginning, Brahman.

This becomes clearer still in another passage, Maitr. Up. VI, 17, where
we read: Brahma ha vâ idam agra âsîd eko 'nanta*h*, 'In the beginning
Brahman was all this. He was one, and infinite.' Here the transition
from the neuter to the masculine gender shows that Brahman only can be
the subject, both in the first and in the second sentence.

In English it may seem to make little difference whether we say,
'Brahman was this,' or 'this was Brahman.' In Sanskrit too we find,
Brahma khalv idam vâva sarvam, 'Brahman indeed is all this' (Maitr. Up.
IV, 6), and Sarva*m* khalv idam Brahma, 'all this is Brahman indeed'
(Khâ*nd*. Up. III, 14, 1). But the logical meaning is always that
Brahman was all this, i.e. all that we see now, Brahman being the
subject, idam the predicate. Brahman becomes idam, not idam Brahman.

Thus the Pa*ñk*adasî, I, 18, says:

Ekâda*s*endriyair yuktyâ *s*âstre*n*âpy avagamyate  
Yâvat ki*mk*id bhaved etad ida*ms*abdodita*m* *g*agat,

which Mr. A. Venis (Pandit, V, p. 667) translates: 'Whatever may be
apprehended through the eleven organs, by argument and revelation, i.e.
the world of phenomena, is expressed by the word idam, this.' The
Pa*ñk*adasî then goes on:

Ida*m* sarvam purâ s*ri*sh*t*er ekam evâdvitâyakam  
Sad evâsîn nâmarûpe nâstâm ity Âru*n*er va*k*a*h*.

This Mr. Venis translates: 'Previous to creation, all this

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

was the existent (sat), one only without a second: name and form were
not:--this is the declaration of the son of Aru*n*a.'

This is no doubt a translation grammatically correct, but from the
philosophical standpoint of the Vedânta, what is really meant is that
before the s*ri*sh*t*i (which is not creation, but the sending forth of
the world, and the sending forth of it, not as something real, but as a
mere illusion), the Real alone, i.e. the Brahman, was, instead of this,
i.e. instead of this illusory world. The illusion was not, but the Real,
i.e. Brahman, was. What became, or what seemed to change, was Brahman,
and therefore the only possible subject, logically, is Brahman,
everything else being a predicate, and a phenomenal predicate only.

If I were arguing with a European, not with an Indian scholar, I should
venture to go even a step further, and try to prove that the idam, in
this and similar sentences, does not mean this, i.e. this world, but
that originally it was intended as an adverb, meaning now, or here. This
use of idam, unsuspected by native scholars, is very frequent in Vedic
literature, and instances may be seen in Boehtlingk's Dictionary. In
that case the translation would be: 'The real (τὸ ὄν), O friend, was
here in the beginning.' This meaning of idam, however, would apply only
to the earliest utterances of ancient Brahmavâdins, while in later times
idam was used and understood in the sense of all that is seen, the
visible universe, just as iyam by itself is used in the sense of the
earth.

However, difficulties of this kind may be overcome, if once we have
arrived at a clear conception of the general drift of the Upanishads.
The real difficulties are of a very different character. They consist in
the extraordinary number of passages which seem to us utterly
meaningless and irrational, or, at all events, so far-fetched that we
can hardly believe that the same authors who can express the deepest
thoughts on religion and philosophy with clearness, nay, with a kind of
poetical eloquence, could have uttered in the same breath such utter
rubbish. Some of the sacrificial technicalities, and their philosophical

the intricacies of the Vedic ceremonial. But there will always remain in
the Upanishads a vast amount of what we can only call meaningless
jargon, and for the presence of which in these ancient mines of thought
I, for my own part, feel quite unable to account. 'Yes,' a friend of
mine wrote to me, after reading some of the Sacred Books of the East,
'you are right, how tremendously ahead of other sacred books is the
Bible. The difference strikes one as almost unfairly great.' So it does,
no doubt. But some of the most honest believers and admirers of the
Bible have expressed a similar disappointment, because they had formed
their ideas of what a Sacred Book ought to be, theoretically, not
historically. The Rev. J. M. Wilson, in his excellent Lectures on the
Theory of Inspiration, p. 32, writes: 'The Bible is so unlike what you
would expect; it does not consist of golden sayings and rules of life;
give explanations of the philosophical and social problems of the past,
the present, and the future; contain teachings immeasurably unlike those
of any other book; but it contains history, ritual, legislation, poetry,
dialogue, prophecy, memoirs, and letters; it contains much that is
foreign to your idea of what a revelation ought to be. But this is not
all. There is not only much that is foreign, but much that is opposed,
to your preconceptions. The Jews tolerated slavery, polygamy, and other
customs and cruelties of imperfect civilisation. There are the
vindictive psalms, too, with their bitter hatred against
enemies,--psalms which we chant in our churches. How can we do so? There
are stories of immorality, of treachery, of crime. How can we read
them?' Still the Bible has been and is a truly sacred, because a truly
historical book, for there is nothing more sacred in this world than the
history of man, in his search after his highest ideals. All ancient
books which have once been called sacred by man, will have their lasting
place in the history of mankind, and those who possess the courage, the
perseverance, and the self-denial of the true miner, and of the true
scholar, will find even in the darkest and dustiest shafts what they are
seeking for,--real nuggets of thought, and precious jewels of faith and
hope.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[xiv:1](sbe15002.htm#fr_9) Mr. Nehemiah Goreh
writes aprâkshyo, and this is no doubt the reading adopted by Roer in
his edition of the *Kh*ândogya-upanishad in the Bibliotheca Indica, p.
384. In *S*aṅkara's commentary also the same form is given. Still
grammar requires aprâksho.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[xiv:2](sbe15002.htm#fr_10) The Pa*ñk*ada*s*î
(I, 20) distinguishes between manas and buddhi, by saying, mano
vimar*s*arûpa*m* syâd buddhi*h* syân ni*sk*âyatmikâ, which places the
difference between the two rather in the degree of certainty, ascribing
deliberation to manas, decision to buddhi.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[xv:1](sbe15002.htm#fr_11) In the Vedânta-Sara,
Sadânanda lays great stress on the fact that in this very chapter of the
*Kh*ândogya-upanishad, the principal subject of the whole chapter is
mentioned both in the beginning and in the end. Tatra

ityâdâv aitadâtmyam ida*m* sarvam (VI, 16, 3) ity ante *k*a
pratipâdanam. 'The beginning with and ending with' imply that the matter
to be declared in any given section is declared both at the beginning
and at the end thereof:--as, for instance, in the sixth section of the
*Kh*ândogya-upanishad, 'the Real, besides which there is nought
else'--which is to be explained in that section--is declared at the
outset in the terms, 'One only, without a second,' and at the end in the
terms 'All this consists of That.'
