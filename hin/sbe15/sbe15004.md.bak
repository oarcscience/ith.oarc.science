## II.

## THE MU*ND*AKA-UPANISHAD.

THIS is an Upanishad of the Atharva-veda. It is a Mantra-upanishad, i.e.
it has the form of a Mantra. But, as the commentators observe, though it
is written in verse, it is not, like other Mantras, to be used for
sacrificial purposes. Its only object is to teach the highest knowledge,
the knowledge of Brahman, which cannot be obtained either by sacrifices
or by worship (upâsana), but by such teaching only as is imparted in the
Upanishad. A man may a hundred times restrain his breath, &c., but
without the Upanishad his ignorance does not cease. Nor is it right to
continue for ever in the performance of sacrificial and other good
works, if one wishes to obtain the highest knowledge of Brahman. The
Sannyâsin alone, who has given up everything, is qualified to know and
to become Brahman. And though it might seem from Vedic legends that
G*ri*hasthas also who continued to live with their families, performing
all the duties required of them by law, had been in possession of the
highest knowledge, this, we are told, is a mistake. Works and knowledge
can be as little together as darkness and light.

This Upanishad too has been often translated since it first appeared in
the Persian translation of Dârâ Shukoh. My own copy of the text and
*S*aṅkara's commentary from the MS. in the Chambers Collection was made
in October 1844. Both are now best accessible in the Bibliotheca Indica,
where Dr. Roer has published the text, the [commentary](errata.htm#0.md) by
*S*aṅkara, a gloss by Ânanda*gñ*âna, and an English translation with
notes.

The title of the Upanishad, Mu*nd*aka, has not yet been explained. The
Upanishad is called Mu*nd*aka-upanishad, and its three chapters are each
called Mu*nd*akam. Native commentators explain it as the shaving
Upanishad, that is, as the Upanishad which cuts off the errors of the
mind, like a razor. Another Upanishad also is called Kshurikâ, the
razor, a name which is explained in the text itself as

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

meaning an instrument for removing illusion and error. The title is all
the more strange because Mu*nd*aka, in its commonest acceptation, is
used as a term of reproach for Buddhist mendicants, who are called
'Shavelings,' in opposition to the Brâhmans, who dress their hair
carefully, and often display by its peculiar arrangement either their
family or their rank. Many doctrines of the Upanishads are, no doubt,
pure Buddhism, or rather Buddhism is on many points the consistent
carrying out of the principles laid down in the Upanishads. Yet, for
that very reason, it seems impossible that this should be the origin of
the name, unless we suppose that it was the work of a man who was, in
one sense, a Mu*nd*aka, and yet faithful to the Brahmanic law.
