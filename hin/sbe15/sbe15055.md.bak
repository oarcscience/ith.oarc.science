### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_281"></span>[1](#fn_281.md).

1\. In the beginning this was Self alone, in the shape of a person
(purusha). He looking round saw nothing but his Self. He first said,
'This is I;' therefore he became I by name. Therefore even now, if a man
is asked, he first says, 'This is I,' and then pronounces the other name
which he may have. And because before (pûrva) all this, he (the Self)
burnt down (ush) all evils, therefore he was a person (pur-usha). Verily
he who knows this, burns down every one who tries to be before him.

2\. He feared, and therefore any one who is lonely fears. He thought,
'As there is nothing but myself, why should I fear?' Thence his fear
passed away. For what should he have feared? Verily fear arises from a
second only.

3\. But he felt no delight. Therefore a man who is lonely feels no
delight. He wished for a second. He was so large as man and wife
together. He then made this his Self to fall in two (pat), and thence
arose husband (pati) and wife (patnî). Therefore Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'We
two <span id="fr_282"></span>[2](#fn_282) are thus (each of us.md) like
half a shell <span id="fr_283"></span>[3](#fn_283.md).' Therefore the void
which was

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

there, is filled by the wife. He embraced her, and men were born.

4\. She thought, 'How can he embrace me, after having produced me from
himself? I shall hide myself.'

She then became a cow, the other became a bull and embraced her, and
hence cows were born. The one became a mare, the other a stallion; the
one a male ass, the other a female ass. He embraced her, and hence
one-hoofed animals were born. The one became a she-goat, the other a
he-goat; the one became a ewe <span id="fr_284"></span>[1](#fn_284.md), the
other a ram. He embraced her, and hence goats and sheep were born. And
thus he created everything that exists in pairs, down to the ants.

5\. He knew, 'I indeed am this creation, for I created all this.' Hence
he became the creation, and he who knows this lives in this his
creation.

6\. Next he thus produced fire by rubbing. From the mouth, as from the
fire-hole, and from the hands he created fire <span
id="fr_285"></span>[2](#fn_285.md). Therefore both the mouth and the hands
are inside without hair, for the fire-hole is inside without hair.

And when they say, 'Sacrifice to this or sacrifice to that god,' each
god is but his manifestation, for he is all gods.

Now, whatever there is moist, that he created from seed; this is Soma.
So far verily is this universe either food or eater. Soma indeed is
food, Agni eater. This is the highest creation of Brahman,

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

when he created the gods from his better part <span
id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_286), and when he, who was (then.md)
mortal <span id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_287.md), created the immortals.
Therefore it was the highest creation. And he who knows this, lives in
this his highest creation.

7\. Now all this was then undeveloped. It became developed by form and
name, so that one could say, 'He, called so and so, is such a one <span
id="fr_288"></span>[3](#fn_288.md).' Therefore at present also all this is
developed by name and form, so that one can say, 'He, called so and so,
is such a one.'

He (Brahman or the Self) entered thither, to the very tips of the
finger-nails, as a razor might be fitted in a razor-case, or as fire in
a fire-place <span id="fr_289"></span>[4](#fn_289.md).

He cannot be seen, for, in part only, when breathing, he is breath by
name; when speaking, speech by name; when seeing, eye by name; when
hearing, ear by name; when thinking, mind by name. All these are but the
names of his acts. And he who worships (regards) him as the one or the
other, does not know him, for he is apart from this (when qualified) by
the one or the other (predicate). Let men worship him as Self, for in
the Self all these are one. This Self is the footstep of everything, for
through it one knows everything <span id="fr_290"></span>[5](#fn_290.md).
And as one can find again by footsteps what was lost, thus he who knows
this finds glory and praise.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

8\. This, which is nearer to us than anything, this Self, is dearer than
a son, dearer than wealth, dearer than all else.

And if one were to say to one who declares another than the Self dear,
that he will lose what is dear to him, very likely it would be so. Let
him worship the Self alone as dear. He who worships the Self alone as
dear, the object of his love will never perish <span
id="fr_291"></span>[1](#fn_291.md).

9\. Here they say: 'If men think that by knowledge of Brahman they will
become everything, what then did that Brahman know, from whence all this
sprang?'

10\. Verily in the beginning this was Brahman, that Brahman knew (its)
Self only, saying, 'I am Brahman.' From it all this sprang. Thus,
whatever Deva was awakened (so as to know Brahman), he indeed became
that (Brahman); and the same with *Ri*shis and men. The *Ri*shi Vâmadeva
saw and understood it, singing, 'I was Manu (moon), I was the sun.'
Therefore now also he who thus knows that he is Brahman, becomes all
this, and even the Devas cannot prevent it, for he himself is their
Self.

Now if a man worships another deity, thinking the deity is one and he
another, he does not know. He is like a beast for the Devas. For verily,
as many beasts nourish a man, thus does every man nourish the Devas. If
only one beast is taken away, it is not pleasant; how much more when
many are taken! Therefore it is not pleasant to the Devas that men
should know this.

11\. Verily in the beginning this was Brahman, one

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

only. That being one, was not strong enough. It created still further
the most excellent Kshatra (power), viz. those Kshatras (powers) among
the Devas,--Indra, Varu*n*a, Soma, Rudra, Par*g*anya, Yama, M*ri*tyu,
Î*s*âna. Therefore there is nothing beyond the Kshatra, and therefore at
the Râ*g*asûya sacrifice the Brâhma*n*a sits down below the Kshatriya.
He confers that glory on the Kshatra alone. But Brahman is
(nevertheless) the birth-place of the Kshatra. Therefore though a king
is exalted, he sits down at the end (of the sacrifice) below the
Brahman, as his birth-place. He who injures him, injures his own
birth-place. He becomes worse, because he has injured one better than
himself.

12\. He <span id="fr_292"></span>[1](#fn_292.md) was not strong enough. He
created the Vi*s* (people), the classes of Devas which in their
different orders are called Vasus, Rudras, Âdityas, Vi*s*ve Devas,
Maruts.

13\. He was not strong enough. He created the *S*ûdra colour (caste), as
Pûshan (as nourisher). This earth verily is Pûshan (the nourisher); for
the earth nourishes all this whatsoever.

14\. He was not strong enough. He created still further the most
excellent Law (dharma). Law is the Kshatra (power) of the Kshatra <span
id="fr_293"></span>[2](#fn_293.md), therefore there is nothing higher than
the Law. Thenceforth even a weak man rules a stronger with the help of
the Law, as with the help of a king. Thus the Law is what is called the
true. And if a man declares what is true, they say he declares the Law;
and if he declares the Law, they say he declares what is true. Thus both
are the same.

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

15\. There are then this Brahman, Kshatra, Vis, and *S*ûdra. Among the
Devas that Brahman existed as Agni (fire) only, among men as Brâhma*n*a,
as Kshatriya through the (divine) Kshatriya, as Vaisya through the
(divine) Vaisya, as *S*ûdra through the (divine) *S*ûdra. Therefore
people wish for their future state among the Devas through Agni (the
sacrificial fire) only; and among men through the Brâhma*n*a, for in
these two forms did Brahman exist.

Now if a man departs this life without having seen his true future life
(in the Self), then that Self, not being known, does not receive and
bless him, as if the Veda had not been read, or as if a good work had
not been done. Nay, even if one who does not know that (Self), should
perform here on earth some great holy work, it will Perish for him in
the end. Let a man worship the Self only as his true state. If a man
worships the Self only as his true state, his work does not Perish, for
whatever he desires that he gets from that Self.

16\. Now verily this Self (of the ignorant man) is the world <span
id="fr_294"></span>[1](#fn_294.md) of all creatures. In so far as man
sacrifices and pours out libations, he is the world of the Devas; in so
far as he repeats the hymns, &c., he is the world of the *Ri*shis; in so
far as he offers cakes to the Fathers and tries to obtain offspring, he
is the world of the Fathers; in so far as he gives shelter and food to
men, he is the world of men; in so far as he finds fodder and water for
the animals, he is the world of the animals; in so far as quadrupeds,
birds, and even ants live in his houses, he is their world. And as every
one wishes his own world not to be injured,

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

thus all beings wish that he who knows this should not be injured.
Verily this is known and has been well reasoned.

17\. In the beginning this was Self alone, one only. He desired, 'Let
there be a wife for me that I may have offspring, and let there be
wealth for me that I may offer sacrifices.' Verily this is the whole
desire, and, even if wishing for more, he would not find it. Therefore
now also a lonely person desires, 'Let there be a wife for me that I may
have offspring, and let there be wealth for me that I may offer
sacrifices.' And so long as he does not obtain either of these things,
he thinks he is incomplete. Now his completeness (is made up as
follows): mind is his self (husband); speech the wife; breath the child;
the eye all worldly wealth, for he finds it with the eye; the ear his
divine wealth, for he hears it with the ear. The body (âtman) is his
work, for with the body he works. This is the fivefold <span
id="fr_295"></span>[1](#fn_295.md) sacrifice, for fivefold is the animal,
fivefold man, fivefold all this whatsoever. He who knows this, obtains
all this.

like the half of a split pea.' I have translated the sentence according
to Professor Boehtlingk's conjecture (Chrestomathie, 2nd ed. p. 357),
