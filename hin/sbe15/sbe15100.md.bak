# *S*VETÂ*S*VATARA-UPANISHAD.

### FIRST ADHYÂYA.

1\. The Brahma-students say: Is Brahman the cause <span
id="fr_703"></span>[1](#fn_701.md)? Whence are we born? Whereby do we live,
and whither do we go? O ye who know Brahman, (tell us) at whose command
we abide, whether in pain or in pleasure?

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

2\. Should time, or nature <span id="fr_704"></span>[1](#fn_702.md), or
necessity, or chance, or the elements be considered as the cause, or he
who is called the person (purusha, vi*gñ*ânâtmâ)? It cannot be their
union either, because that is not self-dependent <span
id="fr_705"></span>[2](#fn_703.md), and the self also is powerless, because
there is (independent of him) a cause of good and evil <span
id="fr_706"></span>[3](#fn_704.md).

3\. The sages, devoted to meditation and concentration, have seen the
power belonging to God himself <span id="fr_707"></span>[4](#fn_705.md),
hidden in its own qualities (gu*n*a). He, being one, superintends all
those causes, time, self, and the rest <span
id="fr_708"></span>[5](#fn_706.md).

4 <span id="fr_709"></span>[6](#fn_707.md). We meditate on him who (like a
wheel) has one felly with three tires, sixteen ends, fifty spokes, with
twenty counter-spokes, and six sets of eight;

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

whose one rope is manifold, who proceeds on three different roads, and
whose illusion arises from two causes.

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

5 <span id="fr_710"></span>[1](#fn_708.md). We meditate on the river whose
water consists of the five streams, which is wild and winding with its
five springs, whose waves are the five vital breaths, whose fountain
head is the mind, the course of the five kinds of perceptions. It has
five whirlpools, its rapids are the five pains; it has fifty kinds of
suffering, and five branches.

6\. In that vast Brahma-wheel, in which all things live and rest, the
bird flutters about, so long as he thinks that the self (in him) is
different from the mover (the god, the lord). When he has been blessed
by him, then he gains immortality <span id="fr_711"></span>[2](#fn_709.md).

7\. But what is praised (in the Upanishads) is the

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Highest Brahman,
and in it there is the triad <span id="fr_712"></span>[1](#fn_710.md). The
Highest Brahman is the safe support, it is imperishable. The
Brahma-students <span id="fr_713"></span>[2](#fn_711.md), when they have
known what is within this (world), are devoted and merged in the
Brahman, free from birth <span id="fr_714"></span>[3](#fn_712.md).

8\. The Lord (î*s*a) supports all this together, the perishable and the
imperishable, the developed and the undeveloped. The (living) self, not
being a lord, is bound <span id="fr_715"></span>[4](#fn_713.md), because he
has to enjoy (the fruits of works); but when he has known the god
(deva), he is freed from all fetters.

9\. There are two, one knowing (î*s*vara), the other not-knowing
(*g*îva), both unborn, one strong, the other weak <span
id="fr_716"></span>[5](#fn_714.md); there is she, the unborn, through whom
each man receives the recompense of his works <span
id="fr_717"></span>[6](#fn_715.md); and there is the infinite Self
(appearing) under all forms, but himself inactive. When a man finds out
these three, that is Brahma <span id="fr_718"></span>[7](#fn_716.md).

10\. That which is perishable <span id="fr_719"></span>[8](#fn_717.md) is
the Pradhâna <span id="fr_720"></span>[9](#fn_718) (the first.md), the
immortal and imperishable is Hara <span
id="fr_721"></span>[10](#fn_719.md).

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The one god rules
the perishable (the pradhâna) and the (living) self <span
id="fr_722"></span>[1](#fn_720.md). From meditating on him, from joining
him, from becoming one with him there is further cessation of all
illusion in the end.

11\. When that god is known, all fetters fall off, sufferings are
destroyed, and birth and death cease. From meditating on him there
arises, on the dissolution of the body, the third state, that of
universal lordship <span id="fr_723"></span>[2](#fn_721.md); but he only
who is alone, is satisfied <span id="fr_724"></span>[3](#fn_722.md).

12\. This, which rests eternally within the self, should be known; and
beyond this not anything has to be known. By knowing the enjoyer <span
id="fr_725"></span>[4](#fn_723.md), the enjoyed, and the ruler, everything
has been declared to be threefold, and this is Brahman.

13\. As the form of fire, while it exists in the under-wood <span
id="fr_726"></span>[5](#fn_724.md), is not seen, nor is its seed destroyed,

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

but it has to be seized again and again by means of the stick and the
under-wood, so it is in both cases, and the Self has to be seized in the
body by means of the pra*n*ava (the syllable Om).

14\. By making his body the under-wood, and the syllable Om the
upper-wood, man, after repeating the drill of meditation, will perceive
the bright god, like the spark hidden in the wood <span
id="fr_727"></span>[1](#fn_725.md).

15\. As oil in seeds, as butter in cream, as water in (dry)
river-beds <span id="fr_728"></span>[2](#fn_726.md), as fire in wood, so is
the Self seized within the self, if man looks for him by truthfulness
and penance <span id="fr_729"></span>[3](#fn_727.md);

16\. (If he looks) for the Self that pervades everything, as butter is
contained in milk, and the roots whereof are self-knowledge and penance.
That is the Brahman taught by the Upanishad.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_701"></span>[231:1](sbe15100.htm#fr_703.md) This translation
seems the one which *S*aṅkara himself prefers, for on p. 277, when
recapitulating, he says, kim brahma kâra*n*a*m* âhosvit kâlâdi. In
comparing former translations, whether by Weber, Roer, Gough, and
others, it will be seen that my own differs considerably from every one
of them, and differs equally from *S*aṅkara's interpretation. It would
occupy too much space to criticise former translations, nor would it
seem fair, considering how long ago they were made, and how imperfect
were the materials which were then accessible. All I wish my readers to
understand is that, if I differ from my predecessors, I do so after
having carefully examined their renderings. Unfortunately, Roer's
edition of both the text and the commentary is often far from correct.
Thus in the very first verse of the *S*vetâ*s*vatara-upanishad, I think
we ought to read sampratish*th*â*h*, instead of sampratish*th*itâ*h*. In
the commentary the reading is right. Vyavasyâm is a misprint for
vyavasthâm. In the second verse we must separate kâla*h* and
svabhâva*h*. Yad*rikhh*â no very unusual word, meaning chance, was
formerly taken for a name of the moon! Instead of na tvâtmabhâvât, both
sense and metre require that we should read anâtmabhâvât, though the
commentators take a different view. They say, because there is a self,
and then go on to say that even that would not suffice. Such matters,
however, belong to a critical commentary on the Upanishads rather than
to a translation, and I can refer to them in cases of absolute necessity
only, and where the readings of the two MSS., A. and B, seem to offer
some help.

<span id="fn_702"></span>[232:1](sbe15100.htm#fr_704.md) Svabhâva, their
own nature or independent character.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[232:2](sbe15100.htm#fr_705.md) Union presupposes
a uniter.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[232:3](sbe15100.htm#fr_706.md) Âtmâ is explained
by *S*aṅkara as the *g*îva*h*, the living self, and as that living self
is in his present state determined by karman, work belonging to a former
existence, it cannot be thought of as an independent cause.

<span id="fn_705"></span>[232:4](sbe15100.htm#fr_707.md) Devâtma*s*akti is
a very important term, differently explained by the commentators, but
meaning a power belonging to the Deva, the Î*s*vara, the Lord, not
independent of him, as the *S*âṅkhyas represent Prak*ri*ti or nature.
Herein lies the important distinction between Vedanta and *S*â*n*khya.

<span id="fn_706"></span>[232:5](sbe15100.htm#fr_708.md) Kâlâtmabhyâ*m*
yuktâni, kâlapurushasa*m*yuktâni svabhâvâdini. Âtman is here taken as
synonymous with purusha in verse 2.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[232:6](sbe15100.htm#fr_709.md) It is difficult to
say whether this verse was written as a summing up of certain
technicalities recognised in systems of philosophy existing at the time,
or whether it is a mere play of fancy. I prefer the former view, and
subjoin the explanation given by *S*aṅkara, though it is quite possible
that on certain points he may be mistaken. The Î*s*vara or deva is
represented as a wheel with one felly, which would seem to be the
phenomenal world. It is called triv*ri*t, threefold, or rather having
three tires, three bands or hoops to bind the felly, these tires being
intended for the three gu*n*as of the prak*ri*ti, the Sattva, Ra*g*as,
and Tamas. In the Brahmopanishad (Bibl. Ind. <span id="page_233">p.
233</span> p. 251) the triv*ri*t sûtram is mentioned. Next follows
sho*d*a*s*ântam, ending in the sixteen. These sixteen are differently
explained. They may be meant for the five elements and the eleven
indriyas or organs (the five receptive and the five active senses,
together with manas, the common sensory); or for the sixteen kalâs,
mentioned in the Pra*sñ*opanishad, VI, 1, p. 283. Then follows a new
interpretation. The one felly may be meant for the chaos, the
undeveloped state of things, and the sixteen would then be the two
products in a general form, the Virâ*g* and the Sûtrâtman, while the
remaining fourteen would be the individual products, the bhuvanas or
worlds beginning with Bhû*h*.

Next follows *s*atârdhâram, having fifty spokes. These fifty spokes are
supposed to produce the motion of the mundane wheel, and are explained
by *S*aṅkara as follows:

1\. The five Viparyayas, misconceptions, different kinds of ignorance or
doubt, viz. Tamas, Moha, Mahâmoha, Tâmisra, Andhatâmisra, or, according
to Pata*ñg*ali, ignorance, self-love, love, hatred, and fear
(Yoga-sûtras I, 8; II, 2; Sâṅkhya-sûtras III, 37).

2\. The twenty-eight A*s*aktis, disabilities, causes of misconception.
(See Sâṅkhya-sûtras III, 38.)

3\. The nine inversions of the Tush*t*is, satisfactions. (Sâṅkhya-sûtras
III, 39.)

4\. The eight inversions of the Siddhis, perfections. (Sâṅkhya-sûtras
III, 40.)

These are afterwards explained singly. There are 8 kinds of Tamas, 8
kinds of Moha, 10 kinds of Mahâmoha, 18 kinds of Tâmisra, and 18 kinds
of Andhatâmisra, making 62 in all. More information on the A*s*aktis,
the Tush*t*is, and Siddhis may be found in the Sâṅkhya-sûtras III,
37-45; Sâṅkhya-kârikâ 47 seq.; Yoga-sûtras II, 2 seq.

Then follow the 20 pratyaras, the counter-spokes, or wedges to
strengthen the spokes, viz. the 10 senses and their 10 objects.

The six ash*t*akas or ogdoads are explained as the ogdoads of
Prak*ri*ti, of substances (dhâtu), of powers (ai*s*varya), of states
(bhâva), of gods (deva), of virtues (âtmagu*n*a).

The one, though manifold cord, is love or desire, Kâma, whether of food,
children, heaven or anything else.

The three paths are explained as righteousness, unrighteousness, <span
id="page_234">p. 234</span> and knowledge, and the one deception arising
from two causes is ignorance of self, produced by good or bad works.

<span id="fn_708"></span>[234:1](sbe15100.htm#fr_710.md) Here again, where
the Î*s*vara is likened to a stream, the minute coincidences are
explained by *S*aṅkara in accordance with certain systems of philosophy.
The five streams are the five receptive organs, the five springs are the
five elements, the five waves are the five active organs. The head is
the manas, the mind, or common sensory, from which the perceptions of
the five senses spring. The five whirlpools are the objects of the five
senses, the five rapids are the five pains of being in the womb, being
born, growing old, growing ill, and dying. The next adjective
pa*ñk*â*s*adbhedâm is not fully explained by *S*aṅkara. He only mentions
the five divisions of the kle*s*a (see Yoga-sûtras II, 2), but does not
show how their number is raised to fifty. Dr. Roer proposes to read
pa*ñk*akle*s*a-bhedâm, but that would not agree with the metre. The five
parvans or branches are not explained, and may refer to the fifty kinds
of suffering (kle*s*a). The whole river, like the wheel in the preceding
verse, is meant for the Brahman as kâryakâra*n*âtmaka, in the form of
cause and effect, as the phenomenal, not the absolutely real world.

<span id="fn_709"></span>[234:2](sbe15100.htm#fr_711.md) If he has been
blessed by the Î*s*vara, i.e. when he has been accepted by the Lord,
when he has discovered his own true self in the Lord. It must be
remembered, however, that both the Î*s*vara, the Lord, and the purusha,
the individual soul, are phenomenal only, and that the Brahma-wheel is
meant for the prapa*ñk*a, the manifest, but unreal world.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[235:1](sbe15100.htm#fr_712.md) The subject
(bhokt*ri*), the object (bhogya), and the mover (prerit*ri*), see verse
12.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[235:2](sbe15100.htm#fr_713.md) B. has Vedavido,
those who know the Vedas.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[235:3](sbe15100.htm#fr_714.md) Tasmin pralîyate
tv âtmâ samâdhi*h* sa udâh*ri*ta*h*.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[235:4](sbe15100.htm#fr_715.md) Read badhyate for
budhyate.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[235:5](sbe15100.htm#fr_716.md) The form
î*s*anî*s*au is explained as *kh*ândasa; likewise brahmam for brahma.

<span id="fn_715"></span>[235:6](sbe15100.htm#fr_717.md) Cf. *S*vet. Up.
IV, 5, bhuktabhogyâm.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[235:7](sbe15100.htm#fr_718) The three are (1.md)
the lord, the personal god, the creator and ruler; (2) the individual
soul or souls; and (3) the power of creation, the devâtma*s*akti of
verse 3. All three are contained in Brahman; see verses 7, 12. So 'pi
mâyî parame*s*varo mâyopâdhisannidhes tadvân iva.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[235:8](sbe15100.htm#fr_719.md) See verse 8.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[235:9](sbe15100.htm#fr_720.md) The recognised
name for Prak*ri*ti, or here Devâtma*s*akti, in the later Sâṅkhya
philosophy.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[235:10](sbe15100.htm#fr_721.md) Hara, one of the
names of *S*iva or Rudra, is here explained as <span id="page_236">p.
236</span> avidyâder hara*n*ât, taking away ignorance. He would seem to
be meant for the Î*s*vara or deva, the one god, though immediately
afterwards he is taken for the true Brahman, and not for its phenomenal
divine personification only.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[236:1](sbe15100.htm#fr_722.md) The self, Âtman,
used here, as before, for purusha, the individual soul, or rather the
individual souls.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[236:2](sbe15100.htm#fr_723.md) A blissful state
in the Brahma-world, which, however, is not yet perfect freedom, but may
lead on to it. Thus it is said in the *S*ivadharmottara:

Dhyânâd ai*s*varyam, atulam ai*s*varyât sukham uttamam,  
*Gñ*ânena tat paritya*g*ya videho muktim âpnuyât.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[236:3](sbe15100.htm#fr_724.md) This alone-ness,
kevalatvam, is produced by the knowledge that the individual self is one
with the divine self, and that both the individual and the divine self
are only phenomenal forms of the true Self, the Brahman.

<span id="fn_723"></span>[236:4](sbe15100.htm#fr_725.md) Bhoktâ, possibly
for bhoktrâ, unless it is a *Kh*ândasa form. It was quoted before, Bibl.
Ind. p. 292, l. 5. The enjoyer is the purusha, the individual soul, the
subject; the enjoyed is prak*ri*ti, nature, the object; and the ruler is
the Î*s*vara, that is, Brahman, as god. I take brahmam etat in the same
sense here as in verse 9.

<span id="fn_724"></span>[236:5](sbe15100.htm#fr_726.md) This metaphor,
like most philosophical metaphors in Sanskrit, <span id="page_237">p.
237</span> is rather obscure at first sight, but very exact when once
understood. Fire, as produced by a fire drill, is compared to the Self.
It is not seen at first, yet it must be there all the time; its liṅga or
subtle body cannot have been destroyed, because as soon as the stick,
the indhana, is drilled in the under-wood, the yoni, the fire becomes
visible. In the same way the Self, though invisible during a state of
ignorance, is there all the time, and is perceived when the body has
been drilled by the Pra*n*ava, that is, after, by a constant repetition
of the sacred syllable Om, the body has been subdued, and the ecstatic
vision of the Self has been achieved.

Indhana, the stick used for drilling, and yoni, the under-wood, in which
the stick is drilled, are the two ara*n*is, the fire-sticks used for
kindling fire. See Tylor, Anthropology, p. 260.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[237:1](sbe15100.htm#fr_727.md) Cf.
Dhyânavindûpan. verse 20; Brahmopanishad, p. 256.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[237:2](sbe15100.htm#fr_728.md) Srotas, a stream,
seems to mean here the dry bed of a stream, which, if dug into, will
yield water.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[237:3](sbe15100.htm#fr_729.md) The construction
is correct, if we remember that he who is seized is the same as he who
looks for the hidden Self. But the metre would be much improved if we
accepted the reading of the Brahmopanishad, evam âtmâ âtmani g*ri*hyate
'sau, which is confirmed by B. The last line would be improved by
reading, satyenaina*m* ye 'nupa*s*yanti dhîrâ*h*.
