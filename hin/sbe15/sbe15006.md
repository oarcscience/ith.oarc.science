*The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## IV.

## THE BRIHADÂRA*N*YAKA-UPANISHAD.

THIS Upanishad has been so often edited and discussed that it calls for
no special remarks. It forms part of the Satapatha-brâhma*n*a. In the
Mâdhyandina-*s*âkhâ of that Brâhma*n*a, which has been edited by
Professor Weber, the Upanishad, consisting of six adhyâyas, begins with
the fourth adhyâya (or third prapâ*th*aka) of the fourteenth book.

There is a commentary on the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka-upanishad by
Dviveda*s*rînârâya*n*asûnu Dvivedagaṅga, which has been carefully edited
by Weber in his great edition of the *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a from a MS.
in the Bodleian Library, formerly belonging to Dr. Mill, in which the
Upanishad is called Mâdhyandinîya-brâhma*n*a-upanishad.

In the Kâ*n*va-*s*âkhâ the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka-upanishad forms the
seventeenth book of the *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a, consisting of six
adhyâyas.

As *S*aṅkara's commentary and the gloss of Ânandatîrtha, edited by Dr.
Roer in the Bibliotheca Indica, follow the Kâ*n*va-*s*âkhâ, I have
followed the same text in my translation.

Besides Dr. Roer's edition of the text, commentary and gloss of this
Upanishad, there is Poley's edition of the text. There is also a
translation of it by Dr. Roer, with large extracts from *S*aṅkara's
commentary.
