### FIFTH ADHYÂYA.

1\. In the imperishable and infinite Highest Brahman <span
id="fr_807"></span>[1](#fn_805.md), wherein the two, knowledge and
ignorance, are hidden <span id="fr_808"></span>[2](#fn_806.md), the one,
ignorance, perishes <span id="fr_809"></span>[3](#fn_807.md), the other,
knowledge, is immortal; but he who controls both, knowledge and
ignorance, is another <span id="fr_810"></span>[4](#fn_808.md).

2\. It is he who, being one only, rules over every germ (cause), over
all forms, and over all germs; it is he who, in the beginning,
bears <span id="fr_811"></span>[5](#fn_809.md) in his thoughts the wise
son, the fiery, whom he wishes to look on <span
id="fr_812"></span>[6](#fn_810.md) while he is born <span
id="fr_813"></span>[7](#fn_811.md).

3 <span id="fr_814"></span>[8](#fn_812.md). In that field <span
id="fr_815"></span>[9](#fn_813.md) in which the god, after spreading out
one net after another <span id="fr_816"></span>[10](#fn_814.md) in various
ways, draws it together again, the Lord, the great Self <span
id="fr_817"></span>[11](#fn_815.md), having

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

further created the lords <span id="fr_818"></span>[1](#fn_816.md), thus
carries on his lordship over all.

4\. As the car (of the sun) shines, lighting up all quarters, above,
below, and across, thus does that god, the holy, the adorable, being
one, rule over all that has the nature of a germ <span
id="fr_819"></span>[2](#fn_817.md).

5\. He, being one, rules over all and everything, so that the universal
germ ripens its nature, diversifies all natures that can be
ripened <span id="fr_820"></span>[3](#fn_818.md), and determines all
qualities <span id="fr_821"></span>[4](#fn_819.md).

6 <span id="fr_822"></span>[5](#fn_820). Brahma (Hira*n*yagarbha.md) knows
this, which is hidden in the Upanishads, which are hidden in the Vedas,
as the Brahma-germ. The ancient gods

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

and poets who knew it, they became it and were immortal.

7 <span id="fr_823"></span>[1](#fn_821.md). But he who is endowed with
qualities, and performs works that are to bear fruit, and enjoys the
reward of whatever he has done, migrates through his own works, the lord
of life, assuming all forms, led by the three Gu*n*as, and following the
three paths <span id="fr_824"></span>[2](#fn_822.md).

8 <span id="fr_825"></span>[3](#fn_823.md). That lower one also, not larger
than a thumb, but brilliant like the sun, who is endowed with
personality and thoughts, with the quality of mind and the quality of
body, is seen small even like the point of a goad.

9\. That living soul is to be known as part of the hundredth part of the
point of a hair <span id="fr_826"></span>[4](#fn_824.md), divided a hundred
times, and yet it is to be infinite.

10\. It is not woman, it is not man, nor is it neuter; whatever body it
takes, with that it is joined <span id="fr_827"></span>[5](#fn_825.md)
(only).

11 <span id="fr_828"></span>[6](#fn_826.md). By means of thoughts,
touching, seeing, and

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

passions the incarnate Self assumes successively in various places
various forms <span id="fr_829"></span>[1](#fn_827.md), in accordance with
his deeds, just as the body grows when food and drink are poured into
it.

12\. That incarnate Self, according to his own qualities, chooses
(assumes) many shapes, coarse or subtile, and having himself caused his
union with them, he is seen as another and another <span
id="fr_830"></span>[2](#fn_828.md), through the qualities of his acts, and
through the qualities of his body.

13 <span id="fr_831"></span>[3](#fn_829.md). He who knows him who has no
beginning and no end, in the midst of chaos, creating all things, having
many forms, alone enveloping everything, is freed from all fetters.

14\. Those who know him who is to be grasped by the mind, who is not to
be called the nest (the body <span id="fr_832"></span>[4](#fn_830).md), who
makes existence and non-existence, the

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

happy one (*S*iva), who also creates the elements <span
id="fr_833"></span>[1](#fn_831.md), they have left the body.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_805"></span>[255:1](sbe15104.htm#fr_807.md) *S*aṅkara explains
Brahmapare by brahma*n*o hira*n*yagarbhât pare, or by parasmin
brahma*n*i, which comes to the same. Vi*gñ*ânâtman adds *kh*ândasa*h*
paranipâta*h*. As the termination e may belong to the locative singular
or to the nom. dual, commentators vary in referring some of the
adjectives either to brahman or to vidyâvidye.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[255:2](sbe15104.htm#fr_808.md) Gû*dh*e, lokair
*gñ*âtum a*s*akye, *S*aṅkarânanda.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[255:3](sbe15104.htm#fr_809.md) *S*aṅkara explains
ksharam, by sa*msri*tikâra*n*am, am*ri*tam by mokshahetu*h*.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[255:4](sbe15104.htm#fr_810.md) *S*aṅkara explains
that he is different from them, being only the sâkshin, or witness.
*S*aṅkarânanda seems to have read Somya, i.e. Somavatpriyadar*s*ana, as
if *S*vetâ*s*vatvara addressed his pupil.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[255:5](sbe15104.htm#fr_811.md) Like a mother, see
I, 9.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[255:6](sbe15104.htm#fr_812.md) Like a father.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[255:7](sbe15104.htm#fr_813.md) See on this verse
the remarks made in the Introduction.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[255:8](sbe15104.htm#fr_814.md) The MSS. read
yasmin for asmin, and patayas for yatayas, which the commentator
explains by patîn.

<span id="fn_813"></span>[255:9](sbe15104.htm#fr_815.md) The world, or the
mûlaprak*ri*ti, the net being the sa*m*sâra.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[255:10](sbe15104.htm#fr_816.md) *S*aṅkara
explains ekaikam by pratyekam, i.e. for every creature, such as gods,
men, beasts, &c.

<span id="fn_815"></span>[255:11](sbe15104.htm#fr_817.md) I doubt whether
mahâtmâ should be translated by the great <span id="page_256">p.
256</span> Self, or whether great would not be sufficient. The whole
verse is extremely difficult.

<span id="fn_816"></span>[256:1](sbe15104.htm#fr_818.md) From
Hira*n*yagarbha to insects; or beginning with Marî*k*i.

<span id="fn_817"></span>[256:2](sbe15104.htm#fr_819.md) Cf. IV, 11; V, 2.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[256:3](sbe15104.htm#fr_820.md) MS. B. has
prâ*k*yân, and explains it by pûrvotpannân.

<span id="fn_819"></span>[256:4](sbe15104.htm#fr_821.md) This is again a
very difficult verse. I have taken vi*s*vayoni*h* as a name for Brahman,
possessed of that devâtma*s*akti which was mentioned before, but I feel
by no means satisfied. The commentators do not help, because they do not
see the difficulty of the construction. If one might conjecture, I
should prefer pa*k*et for pa*k*ati, and should write parinâmayed yat,
and viniyo*g*ayed yat, unless we changed ya*kk*a into ya*s* *k*a.

<span id="fn_820"></span>[256:5](sbe15104.htm#fr_822.md) This verse admits
of various translations, and requires also some metrical emendations.
Thus Vi*gñ*ânâtman explains vedaguhyopanishatsu very ingeniously by the
Veda, i.e. that part of it which teaches sacrifices and their rewards;
the Guhya, i.e. the Âra*n*yaka, which teaches the worship of Brahman
under various legendary aspects; and the Upanishads, which teach the
knowledge of Brahman without qualities. These three divisions would
correspond to the karmakâ*nd*a, yogakâ*nd*a, and *gñ*ânakâ*nd*a
(*G*aimini, Pata*ñg*ali, Bâdarâyana). See Deussen, Vedânta, p. 20. Mr.
Gough and Dr. Roer take Brahmayoni as 'the source of the Veda,' or as
the source of Hira*n*yagarbha. The irregular form vedate may be due to a
corruption of vedânte.

<span id="fn_821"></span>[257:1](sbe15104.htm#fr_823.md) Here begins the
description of what is called the tvam (thou), as opposed to the tat
(that), i.e. the living soul, as opposed to the Highest Brahman.

<span id="fn_822"></span>[257:2](sbe15104.htm#fr_824.md) The paths of vice,
virtue, and knowledge.

<span id="fn_823"></span>[257:3](sbe15104.htm#fr_825.md) Both MSS. (A. and
B.) read ârâgramâtro by avaro 'pi d*ri*sh*th*a*h*.

<span id="fn_824"></span>[257:4](sbe15104.htm#fr_826.md) An expression of
frequent occurrence in Buddhist literature.

<span id="fn_825"></span>[257:5](sbe15104.htm#fr_827.md) A. and B. read
yu*g*yate. A. explains yu*g*yate by sambadhyate. B. explains adyate
bhakshyate tirobhûta*h* kriyate. *S*aṅkara explains rakshyate,
sa*m*rakshyate, tattaddharmân âtmany adhyasyâbhimanyate.

<span id="fn_826"></span>[257:6](sbe15104.htm#fr_828.md) The MSS. vary
considerably. Instead of mohair, A. and B. read homair. They read
grâsâmbuv*ri*sh*t*ya *k*âtma. A. reads âtmaviv*ri*ddhi*g*anma, B.
âtmaniv*ri*ddha*g*anmâ. A. has abhisamprapadye, B. abhisamprapadyate. My
translation follows *S*aṅkara, who seems to have read
âtmaviv*ri*ddhi*g*anma, taking the whole line <span id="page_258">p.
258</span> as a simile and in an adverbial form. Vi*gñ*ânâtman, however,
differs considerably. He reads homai*h*, and explains homa as the act of
throwing oblations into the fire, as in the Agnihotra. This action of
the hands, he thinks, stands for all actions of the various members of
the body. Grâsâmbuv*ri*sh*t*i he takes to mean free distribution of food
and drink, and then explains the whole sentence by 'he whose self is
born unto some states or declines from them again, namely, according as
he has showered food and drink, and has used his hands, eyes, feelings,
and thoughts.' *S*aṅkarânanda takes a similar view, only he construes
saṅkalpanam and spar*s*anam as two d*ri*sh*t*is, te eva d*ri*sh*t*î,
tayor âtmâgnau prakshepâ homâ*h*; and then goes on, na kevalam etai*h*,
ki*m* tv asmin sthâne *s*arire grâsâmbuv*ri*sh*t*yâ ka. He seems to read
âtmaviv*ri*ddhaganmâ, but afterwards explains viv*ri*ddhi by vividhâ
v*ri*ddhi*h*.

<span id="fn_827"></span>[258:1](sbe15104.htm#fr_829.md) Forms as high as
Hira*n*yagarbha or as low as beasts.

<span id="fn_828"></span>[258:2](sbe15104.htm#fr_830.md) Instead of aparo,
B. reads avaro, but explains aparo.

<span id="fn_829"></span>[258:3](sbe15104.htm#fr_831.md) Cf. III, 7; IV,
14, 16.

<span id="fn_830"></span>[258:4](sbe15104.htm#fr_832.md) Nî*d*a is
explained as the body, but *S*aṅkarânanda reads anilâkhyam, who is
called the wind, as being prâ*n*asya prâ*n*am, the breath of the breath.

<span id="fn_831"></span>[259:1](sbe15104.htm#fr_833.md) *S*aṅkara explains
kalâsargakaram by he who creates the sixteen kalâs, mentioned by the
Âtharva*n*ikas, beginning with prâ*n*a, and ending with nâman; see
Pra*sñ*a Up. VI, 4. Vi*gñ*ânâtman suggests two other explanations, 'he
who creates by means of the kalâ, i.e. his inherent power;' or 'he who
creates the Vedas and other sciences.' The sixteen kalâs are, according
to *S*aṅkarânanda, prâ*n*a, *s*raddhâ, kha, vâyu, *g*yoti*h*, ap,
p*ri*thivî, indriya, mana*h*, anna, vîrya, tapa*h*, mantra, karman, kâla
(?), nâman. See also before, I, 4.
