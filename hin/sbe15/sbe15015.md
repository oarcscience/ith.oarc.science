### SIXTH VALLÎ.

1\. 'There is that ancient tree <span id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_132.md),
whose roots grow upward and whose branches grow downward;--that <span
id="fr_133"></span>[2](#fn_133.md) indeed is called the Bright <span
id="fr_134"></span>[3](#fn_134.md), that is called Brahman, that alone is
called the Immortal <span id="fr_135"></span>[4](#fn_135.md). All worlds
are contained in it, and no one goes beyond. This is that.'

2\. 'Whatever there is, the whole world, when gone forth (from the
Brahman), trembles in its breath <span id="fr_136"></span>[5](#fn_136.md).
That Brahman is a great terror, like a drawn sword. Those who know it
become immortal.'

3\. 'From terror of Brahman fire burns, from terror the sun burns, from
terror Indra and Vâyu, and Death, as the fifth, run away <span
id="fr_137"></span>[6](#fn_137.md).'

4\. 'If a man could not understand it before the falling asunder of his
body, then he has to take body again in the worlds of creation <span
id="fr_138"></span>[7](#fn_138.md).'

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

5\. 'As in a mirror, so (Brahman may be seen clearly) here in this
'body; as in a dream, in the world of the Fathers; as in the water, he
is seen about in the world of the Gandharvas; as in light and
shade <span id="fr_139"></span>[1](#fn_139.md), in the world of Brahmâ.'

6\. 'Having understood that the senses are distinct <span
id="fr_140"></span>[2](#fn_140) (from the Âtman.md), and that their rising
and setting (their waking and sleeping) belongs to them in their
distinct existence (and not to the Âtman), a wise man grieves no more.'

7\. 'Beyond. the senses is the mind, beyond the mind is the highest
(created) Being <span id="fr_141"></span>[3](#fn_141.md), higher than that
Being is the Great Self, higher than the Great, the highest
Undeveloped.'

8\. 'Beyond the Undeveloped is the Person, the all-pervading and
entirely imperceptible. Every creature that knows him is liberated, and
obtains immortality.'

9\. 'His form is not to be seen, no one beholds him with the eye. He is
imagined by the heart, by wisdom, by the mind. Those who know this, are
immortal <span id="fr_142"></span>[4](#fn_142.md).'

10\. 'When the five instruments of knowledge stand still together with
the mind, and when the intellect does not move, that is called the
highest state.'

11\. 'This, the firm holding back of the senses, is what is called Yoga.
He must be free from thoughtlessness then, for Yoga comes and goes <span
id="fr_143"></span>[5](#fn_143.md).'

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

12\. 'He (the Self) cannot be reached by speech, by mind, or by the eye.
How can it be apprehended except by him who says: "He is?"'

13\. 'By the words "He is," is he to be apprehended, and by (admitting)
the reality of both (the invisible Brahman and the visible world, as
coming from Brahman). When he has been apprehended by the words "He is,"
then his reality reveals itself'

14\. 'When all desires that dwell in his heart cease, then the mortal
becomes immortal, and obtains Brahman.'

15\. 'When all the ties <span id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_144.md) of the
heart are severed here on earth, then the mortal becomes immortal--here
ends the teaching <span id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_145.md).'

 

116\. 'There are a hundred and one arteries of the heart <span
id="fr_146"></span>[3](#fn_146.md), one of them penetrates the crown of the
head <span id="fr_147"></span>[4](#fn_147.md). Moving upwards by it, a man
(at his death) reaches the Immortal <span
id="fr_148"></span>[5](#fn_148.md); the other arteries serve for departing
in different directions.'

17\. 'The Person not larger than a thumb, the inner Self, is always
settled in the heart of men <span id="fr_149"></span>[6](#fn_149.md). Let a
man draw that Self forth from his body with steadiness,

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

as one draws the pith from a reed <span id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_150.md).
Let him know that Self as the Bright, as the Immortal; yes, as the
Bright, as the Immortal <span id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_151.md).'

18\. Having received this knowledge taught by Death and the whole rule
of Yoga (meditation), [Nâ*k*iketa](errata.htm#1.md) became free from
passion <span id="fr_152"></span>[3](#fn_152.md) and death, and obtained
Brahman. Thus it will be with another also who knows thus what relates
to the Self.

19\. May He protect us both! May He enjoy us both! May we acquire
Strength together! May our knowledge become bright! May we never
quarrel <span id="fr_153"></span>[4](#fn_153.md)! Om! Peace! peace! peace!
Harih, Om!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_132"></span>[21:1](sbe15015.htm#fr_132.md) The fig-tree which
sends down its branches so that they strike root and form new stems, one
tree growing into a complete forest.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[21:2](sbe15015.htm#fr_133.md) Cf. Bhag. Gîtâ XV,
1-3.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[21:3](sbe15015.htm#fr_134.md) Cf. V, 8.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[21:4](sbe15015.htm#fr_135.md) The commentator
says that the tree is the world, and its root is Brahman, but there is
nothing to support this view in the original, where tree, roots, and
branches are taken together as representing the Brahman in its various
manifestations.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[21:5](sbe15015.htm#fr_136.md) According to the
commentator, in the highest Brahman.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[21:6](sbe15015.htm#fr_137.md) Cf. Taitt. Up. II,
8, 1.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[21:7](sbe15015.htm#fr_138.md) The commentator
translates: 'If a man is able to understand (Brahman), then even before
the decay of his body, he is liberated. If he is not able to understand
it, then he has to take body again in the created worlds.' I doubt
whether it is possible to supply so much, and should prefer to read iha
*k*en nâ*s*akad, though I find it difficult to explain how so simple a
text should have been misunderstood and corrupted.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[22:1](sbe15015.htm#fr_139.md) Roer: 'As in a
picture and in the sunshine!

<span id="fn_140"></span>[22:2](sbe15015.htm#fr_140.md) They arise from the
elements, ether, &c.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[22:3](sbe15015.htm#fr_141.md) Buddhi or
intellect, cf. III, 10.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[22:4](sbe15015.htm#fr_142.md) Much better in
*S*vet. Up. IV, 20: 'Those who know him by the heart as being in the
heart, and by the mind, are immortal.'

<span id="fn_143"></span>[22:5](sbe15015.htm#fr_143.md) *S*aṅkara explains
apyaya by apâya.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[23:1](sbe15015.htm#fr_144.md) Ignorance, passion,
&c. Cf. Mu*nd*. Up. II, 11, 10; II, 2, 9.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[23:2](sbe15015.htm#fr_145.md) The teaching of the
Vedânta extends so far and no farther. (Cf. Pra*s*na Up. VI, 7.) What
follows has reference, according to the commentator, not to him who
knows the highest Brahman, for he becomes Brahman at once and migrates
no more; but to him who does not know the highest Brahman fully, and
therefore migrates to the Brahmaloka, receiving there the reward for his
partial knowledge and for his good works.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[23:3](sbe15015.htm#fr_146.md) Cf. *Kh*ând. Up.
VIII, 6, 6.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[23:4](sbe15015.htm#fr_147.md) It passes out by
the head.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[23:5](sbe15015.htm#fr_148.md) The commentator
says: He rises through the sun (Mu*nd*. Up. I, 2, 11) to a world in
which he enjoys some kind of immortality.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[23:6](sbe15015.htm#fr_149.md) *S*vet. Up. III.
13.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[24:1](sbe15015.htm#fr_150.md) Roer: 'As from a
painter's brush a fibre.'

<span id="fn_151"></span>[24:2](sbe15015.htm#fr_151.md) This repetition
marks, as usual, the end of a chapter.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[24:3](sbe15015.htm#fr_152.md) Vira*g*a, free from
vice and virtue. It may have been vi*g*ara, free from old age. See,
however, Mu*nd*. Up. I, 2, 11.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[24:4](sbe15015.htm#fr_153.md) Cf. Taitt. Up. III,
1; III, 10, note.
