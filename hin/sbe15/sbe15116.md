### FIFTH PRAPÂ*TH*AKA <span id="fr_1026"></span>[1](#fn_1023).

1\. Next follows Kutsâyana's hymn of praise:

'Thou art Brahmâ, and thou art Vish*n*u, thou art Rudra, thou
Pra*g*âpati <span id="fr_1027"></span>[2](#fn_1024), thou art Agni,
Varu*n*a, Vâyu, thou art Indra, thou the Moon.

Thou art Anna <span id="fr_1028"></span>[3](#fn_1025) (the food or the
eater), thou art Yama, thou art the Earth, thou art All, thou art the
Imperishable. In thee all things exist in many forms, whether for their
natural or for their own (higher) ends.

Lord of the Universe, glory to thee! Thou art the Self of All, thou art
the maker of All, the enjoyer of All; thou art all life, and the lord of
all pleasure and joy <span id="fr_1029"></span>[4](#fn_1026). Glory to
thee, the tranquil, the deeply hidden, the incomprehensible, the
immeasurable, without beginning and without end.'

2\. 'In the beginning <span id="fr_1030"></span>[5](#fn_1027) darkness
(tamas) alone was this. It was in the Highest, and, moved by the
Highest, it becomes uneven. Thus it becomes obscurity

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

(ra*g*as) <span id="fr_1031"></span>[1](#fn_1028). Then this obscurity,
being moved, becomes uneven. Thus it becomes goodness (sattva). Then
this goodness, being moved, the essence flowed forth <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[2](#fn_1029). This is that part (or state of Self)
which is entirely intelligent, reflected in man (as the sun is in
different vessels of water) knowing the body (kshetra*gñ*a), attested by
his conceiving, willing, and believing, it is Pra*g*âpati, called
Vi*s*va. His manifestations have been declared before <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[3](#fn_1030). Now that part of him which belongs to
darkness, that, O students <span id="fr_1034"></span>[4](#fn_1031), is
he who is called Rudra. That part of him which belongs to obscurity,
that, O students, is he who is called Brahmâ. That part of him which
belongs to goodness, that, O students, is he who is called Vish*n*u. He
being one, becomes three, becomes eight <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[5](#fn_1032), becomes eleven <span
id="fr_1036"></span>[6](#fn_1033), becomes twelve, becomes infinite.
Because <span id="fr_1037"></span>[7](#fn_1034) he thus came to be, he
is the Being (neut.), he moves about, having entered all beings, he has
become the Lord of all beings. He is the Self within and without, yes,
within and without.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1023"></span>[303:1](sbe15116.htm#fr_1026) At the beginning
of the fifth Prapâ*th*aka my MS. gives the *S*lokas which in the printed
edition are found in VI, 34, p. 178, Atreme *s*lokâ bhavanti, yathâ
nirindhano vahnir, &c., to nirvishaya*m* sm*ri*tam. Then follows as § 2,
Atha yatheda*m* Kautsyâyanistutis, tvam, &c.

<span id="fn_1024"></span>[303:2](sbe15116.htm#fr_1027) The commentator
explains Brahmâ by Hira*n*yagarbha and Pra*g*âpati by Virâ*g*.

<span id="fn_1025"></span>[303:3](sbe15116.htm#fr_1028) M. reads tvam
Manus, tva*m* Yama*s* *k*a tvam, p*ri*thivî tvam athâ*k*yuta*h*, which
is so clearly the right reading that it is difficult to understand how
the mistakes arose which are presupposed by the commentary. See Taitt.
Up. II, 2.

<span id="fn_1026"></span>[303:4](sbe15116.htm#fr_1029) M. reads
vi*s*vakrî*d*ârati*h* prabhu*h*, which seems better.

<span id="fn_1027"></span>[303:5](sbe15116.htm#fr_1030) M. reads tamo vâ
idam ekam âsta tat paro syât tat pare*n*eritam. It may have been tat
pare 'sthât.

<span id="fn_1028"></span>[304:1](sbe15116.htm#fr_1031) M. reads etad
vai ra*g*aso rûpam, which is better, or, at least, more in accordance
with what follows.

<span id="fn_1029"></span>[304:2](sbe15116.htm#fr_1032) M. reads sattvam
everitarasas sa*m* prâs*ri*vat.

<span id="fn_1030"></span>[304:3](sbe15116.htm#fr_1033) A reference to
Maitr. Up. II, 5, would have saved the commentator much trouble. M. has
a better text. It leaves out vi*s*veti or vi*s*vâkhyas after
pra*g*âpati, which may be wrong, but then goes on: tasya proktâ agryâs
tanavo brahmâ rudro vish*n*ur iti. In enumerating the three agryâs
tanava*h*, however, M. is less consistent, for it begins with ra*g*as or
Brahmâ, then goes on to tamas or Rudra, and ends with sattva or
Vish*n*u. The Anubhûtiprakâsa, verse 142, has the right succession.

<span id="fn_1031"></span>[304:4](sbe15116.htm#fr_1034) This vocative,
brahma*k*ârino, is always left out in M.

<span id="fn_1032"></span>[304:5](sbe15116.htm#fr_1035) The five
prâ*n*as, the sun, moon, and asterisms.

<span id="fn_1033"></span>[304:6](sbe15116.htm#fr_1036) The eleven
organs of sense and action, which, by dividing manas and buddhi, become
twelve.

<span id="fn_1034"></span>[304:7](sbe15116.htm#fr_1037) M. reads
aparimitadhâ *k*odbhûtatvâd bhûteshu *k*arati pravish*t*a*h*
sarvabhûtânâm.
