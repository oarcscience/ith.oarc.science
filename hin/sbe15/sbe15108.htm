<p>1. Then Kausalya &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana asked: 'Sir, whence is that Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a (spirit) born? How does it come into this body? And how does it abide, after it has divided itself? How does it go out? How does it support what is without&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_892"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and how what is within?'</p>  
<p>2. He replied: 'You ask questions more difficult, but you are very fond of Brahman, therefore I shall tell it you.</p>  
<p>3. This Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a (spirit) is born of the Self. Like the shadow thrown on a man, this (the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a) is</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="green">p. 277</font></A></p>  
<p>spread out over it (the Brahman)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. By the work of the mind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> does it come into this body.</p>  
<p>4. As a king commands officials, saying to them: Rule these villages or those, so does that Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a (spirit) dispose the other pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as, each for their separate work.</p>  
<p>5. The Ap&acirc;na (the down-breathing) in the organs of excretion and generation; the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a himself dwells in eye and ear, passing through mouth and nose. In the middle is the Sam&acirc;na&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (the on-breathing); it carries what has been sacrificed as food equally (over the body), and the seven lights proceed from it.</p>  
<p>6. The Self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is in the heart. There are the 101 arteries, and in each of them there are a hundred (smaller veins), and for each of these branches there are 72,000&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. In these the Vy&acirc;na (the back-breathing) moves.</p>  
<p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="green">p. 278</font></A></p>  
<p>7. Through one of them, the Ud&acirc;na (the out-breathing) leads (us) upwards to the good world by good work, to the bad world by bad work, to the world of men by both.</p>  
<p>8. The sun rises as the external Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, for it assists the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a in the eye&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The deity that exists in the earth, is there in support of man's Ap&acirc;na (down-breathing). The ether between (sun and earth) is the Sam&acirc;na (on-breathing), the air is Vy&acirc;na (back-breathing).</p>  
<p>9. Light is the Ud&acirc;na (out-breathing), and therefore he whose light has gone out comes to a new birth with his senses absorbed in the mind.</p>  
<p>10. Whatever his thought (at the time of death) with that he goes back to Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, and the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, united with light&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_899"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, together with the self (the <I>g</I>&icirc;v&acirc;tm&acirc;) leads on to the world, as deserved.</p>  
<p>11. He who, thus knowing, knows Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, his offspring does not perish, and he becomes immortal. Thus says the <I>S</I>loka:</p>  
<p>12. He who has known the origin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the entry, the place, the fivefold distribution, and the internal state&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, obtains immortality, yes, obtains immortality.'</p>

Sam&acirc;na is here supposed to be between pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a and ap&acirc;na, and to distribute the food equally, samam, over the body. The seven lights are explained as the two eyes, the two ears, the two nostrils, and the mouth.</P>
