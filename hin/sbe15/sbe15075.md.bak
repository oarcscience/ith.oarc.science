### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

1\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya came to *G*anaka Vaideha, and he did not mean to speak
with him <span id="fr_476"></span>[1](#fn_476.md). But when formerly

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *G*anaka Vaideha
and Yâ*gñ*avalkya had a disputation on the Agnihotra, Yâ*gñ*avalkya had
granted him a boon, and he chose (for a boon) that he might be free to
ask him any question he liked. Yâ*gñ*avalkya granted it, and thus the
King was the first to ask him a question.

2\. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'what is the light of man <span
id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_477.md)?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'The sun, O King; for, having the sun alone for
his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.'

*G*anaka Vaideha said: 'So indeed it is, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

3\. *G*anaka Vaideha said: 'When the sun has set, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya, what
is then the light of man?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'The moon indeed is his light; for, having the
moon alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and
returns.'

*G*anaka Vaideha said: 'So indeed it is, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

4\. *G*anaka Vaideha said: 'When the sun has set, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya, and
the moon has set, what is the light of man?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'Fire indeed is his light;

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

for, having fire alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his
work, and returns.'

5\. *G*anaka Vaideha said: 'When the sun has set, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya, and
the moon has set, and the fire is gone out, what is then the light of
man?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'Sound indeed is his light; for, having sound
alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.
Therefore, O King, when one cannot see even one's own hand, yet when a
sound is raised, one goes towards it.'

*G*anaka Vaideha said: 'So indeed it is, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya.'

6\. *G*anaka Vaideha said: 'When the sun has set, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya, and
the moon has set, and the fire is gone out, and the sound hushed, what
is then the light of man?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'The Self indeed is his light; for, having the Self
alone as his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.'

7\. *G*anaka Vaideha said: 'Who is that Self?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya replied: 'He who is within the heart, surrounded by the
Prâ*n*as <span id="fr_478"></span>[1](#fn_478) (senses.md), the person of
light, consisting of knowledge. He, remaining the same, wanders along
the two worlds <span id="fr_479"></span>[2](#fn_479.md), as if <span
id="fr_480"></span>[3](#fn_480.md) thinking, as if moving. During sleep (in
dream) he transcends this world and all the forms of death (all that
falls under the sway of death, all that is perishable).

8\. 'On being born that person, assuming his body,

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

becomes united with all evils; when he departs and dies, he leaves all
evils behind.

9\. 'And there are two states for that person, the one here in this
world, the other in the other world, and as a third <span
id="fr_481"></span>[1](#fn_481.md) an intermediate state, the state of
sleep. When in that intermediate state, he sees both those states
together, the one here in this world, and the other in the other world.
Now whatever his admission to the other world may be, having gained that
admission, he sees both the evils and the blessings <span
id="fr_482"></span>[2](#fn_482.md).

'And when he falls asleep, then after having taken away with him the
material from the whole world, destroying <span
id="fr_483"></span>[3](#fn_483.md) and building it up again, he sleeps
(dreams) by his own light. In that state the person is self-illuminated.

10\. 'There are no (real) chariots in that state, no horses, no roads,
but he himself sends forth (creates) chariots, horses, and roads. There
are no blessings there, no happiness, no joys, but he himself sends
forth (creates) blessings, happiness, and joys. There

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

are no tanks there, no lakes, no rivers, but he himself sends forth
(creates) tanks, lakes, and rivers. He indeed is the maker.

11\. 'On this there are these verses:

'After having subdued by sleep all that belongs to the body, he, not
asleep himself, looks down upon the sleeping (senses). Having assumed
light, he goes again to his place, the golden person <span
id="fr_484"></span>[1](#fn_484), the lonely bird. (1.md)

12\. 'Guarding with the breath (prâ*n*a, life) the lower nest, the
immortal moves away from the nest; that immortal one goes wherever he
likes, the golden person, the lonely bird. (2)

13\. 'Going up and down in his dream, the god makes manifold shapes for
himself, either rejoicing together with women, or laughing (with his
friends), or seeing terrible sights. (3)

14\. 'People may see his playground <span
id="fr_485"></span>[2](#fn_485.md) but himself no one ever sees. Therefore
they say, Let no one wake a man suddenly, for it is not easy to remedy,
if he does not get back (rightly to his body)."

'Here some people (object and) say: "No, this (sleep) is the same as the
place of waking, for what he sees while awake, that only he sees when
asleep <span id="fr_486"></span>[3](#fn_486.md)."

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

No, here (in sleep) the person is self-illuminated (as we explained
before).'

*G*anaka Vaideha said: 'I give you, Sir, a thousand. Speak on for the
sake of (my) emancipation.'

15\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'That (person) having enjoyed himself in that
state of bliss (samprasâda, deep sleep), having moved about and seen
both good and evil, hastens back again as he came, to the place from
which he started (the place of sleep), to dream <span
id="fr_487"></span>[1](#fn_487.md). And whatever he may have seen there, he
is not followed (affected) by it, for that person is not attached to
anything.'

*G*anaka Vaideha said: 'So it is indeed, Yâ*gñ*avalkya.

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I give you, Sir, a
thousand. Speak on for the sake of emancipation.'

16\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'That (person) having enjoyed himself in that
sleep (dream), having moved about and seen both good and evil, hastens
back again as he came, to the place from which he started, to be awake.
And whatever he may have seen there, he is not followed (affected) by
it, for that person is not attached to anything.'

*G*anaka Vaideha said: 'So it is indeed, Yâ*gñ*avalkya. I give you, Sir,
a thousand. Speak on for the sake of emancipation.'

17\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'That (person) having enjoyed himself in that
state of waking, having moved about and seen both good and evil, hastens
back again as he came, to the place from which he started, to the state
of sleeping (dream).

18\. 'In fact, as a large fish moves along the two banks of a river, the
right and the left, so does that person move along these two states, the
state of sleeping and the state of waking.

19\. 'And as a falcon, or any other (swift) bird, after he has roamed
about here in the air, becomes tired, and folding his wings is carried
to his nest, so does that person hasten to that state where, when
asleep, he desires no more desires, and dreams no more dreams.

20\. 'There are in his body the veins called Hitâ, which are as small as
a hair divided a thousandfold, full of white, blue, yellow, green, and
red <span id="fr_488"></span>[1](#fn_488.md). Now

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

when, as it were, they kill him, when, as it were they overcome him,
when, as it were, an elephant chases him, when, as it were, he falls
into a well, he fancies, through ignorance, that danger which he
(commonly) sees in waking. But when he fancies that he is, as it were, a
god, or that he is, as it were, a king <span
id="fr_489"></span>[1](#fn_489.md), or "I am this altogether," that is his
highest world <span id="fr_490"></span>[2](#fn_490.md).

21\. 'This indeed is his (true) form, free from desires, free from evil,
free from fear <span id="fr_491"></span>[3](#fn_491.md). Now as a man, when
embraced by a beloved wife, knows nothing that is without, nothing that
is within, thus this person, when embraced by the intelligent (prâ*gñ*a)
Self, knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within. This indeed
is his (true) form, in which his wishes are fulfilled, in which the Self
(only) is

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

his wish, in which no wish is left,--free from any sorrow <span
id="fr_492"></span>[1](#fn_492.md).

22\. 'Then a father is not a father, a mother not a mother, the worlds
not worlds, the gods not gods, the Vedas not Vedas. Then a thief is not
a thief, a murderer not a murderer <span
id="fr_493"></span>[2](#fn_493.md), a *K*â*nd*âla <span
id="fr_494"></span>[3](#fn_494.md) not a *K*â*nd*âla, a Paulkasa <span
id="fr_495"></span>[4](#fn_495.md) not a Paulkasa, a *S*rama*n*a <span
id="fr_496"></span>[5](#fn_496.md) not a *S*rama*n*a, a Tâpasa <span
id="fr_497"></span>[6](#fn_497.md) not a Tâpasa. He is not followed by
good, not followed by evil, for he has then overcome all the sorrows of
the heart <span id="fr_498"></span>[7](#fn_498.md).

23\. 'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not
see, yet he is seeing, though he does not see <span
id="fr_499"></span>[8](#fn_499.md). For sight is inseparable from the

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

seer, because it cannot perish. But there is then no second, nothing
else different from him that he could see.

24\. 'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not
smell, yet he is smelling, though he does not smell. For smelling is
inseparable from the smeller, because it cannot perish. But there is
then no second, nothing else different from him that he could smell.

25\. 'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not
taste, yet he is tasting, though he does not taste. For tasting is
inseparable from the taster, because it cannot perish. But there is then
no second, nothing else different from him that he could taste.

26\. 'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not
speak, yet he is speaking, though he does not speak. For speaking is
inseparable from the speaker, because it cannot perish. But there is
then no second, nothing else different from him that he could speak.

27\. 'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not
hear, yet he is hearing, though he does not hear. For hearing is
inseparable from the hearer, because it cannot perish. But. there is
then no second, nothing else different from him that he could hear.

28\. 'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not
think, yet he is thinking, though he does not think. For thinking is
inseparable from the thinker, because it cannot perish.

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But there is then
no second, nothing else different from him that he could think.

29\. 'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not
touch, yet he is touching, though he does not touch. For touching is
inseparable from the toucher, because it cannot perish. But there is
then no second, nothing else different from him that he could think.

30\. 'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not
know, yet he is knowing, though he does not know. For knowing is
inseparable from the knower, because it cannot perish. But there is then
no second, nothing else different from him that he could know.

31\. 'When (in waking and dreaming) there is, as it were, another, then
can one see the other, then can one smell the other, then can one speak
to the other, then can one hear the other, then can one think the other,
then can one touch the other, then can one know the other.

32\. 'An ocean <span id="fr_500"></span>[1](#fn_500.md) is that one seer,
without any duality; this is the Brahma-world <span
id="fr_501"></span>[2](#fn_501.md), O King.' Thus did Yâ*gñ*avalkya teach
him. This is his highest goal, this is his highest Success, this is his
highest world, this is his highest bliss. All other creatures live on a
small portion of that bliss.

33\. 'If a man is healthy, wealthy, and lord of others, surrounded by
all human enjoyments, that

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

is the highest blessing of men. Now a hundred of these human blessings
make one blessing of the fathers who have conquered the world (of the
fathers). A hundred blessings of the fathers who have conquered this
world make one blessing in the Gandharva world. A hundred blessings in
the Gandharva world make one blessing of the Devas by merit (work,
sacrifice), who obtain their godhead by merit. A hundred blessings of
the Devas by merit make one blessing of the Devas by birth, also (of) a
*S*rotriya <span id="fr_502"></span>[1](#fn_502.md) who is without sin, and
not overcome by desire. A hundred blessings of the Devas by birth make
one blessing in the world of Pra*g*âpati, also (of) a *S*rotriya who is
without sin, and not overcome. by desire. A hundred blessings in the
world of Pra*g*âpati make one blessing in the world of Brahman, also
(of) a *S*rotriya who is without sin, and not overcome by desire. And
this is the highest blessing <span id="fr_503"></span>[2](#fn_503.md).

'This is the Brahma-world, O king,' thus spake Yâ*gñ*avalkya.

*G*anaka Vaideha said: 'I give you, Sir, a thousand. Speak on for the
sake of (my) emancipation.'

Then Yâ*gñ*avalkya was afraid lest the King, having become full of
understanding, should drive him from all his positions <span
id="fr_504"></span>[3](#fn_504.md).

34\. And Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'That (person), having enjoyed himself in
that state of sleeping (dream),

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

having moved about and seen both good and bad, hastens back again as he
came, to the place from which he started, to the state of waking <span
id="fr_505"></span>[1](sbe15076.htm#fn_505.md).

35\. 'Now as a heavy-laden carriage moves along groaning, thus does this
corporeal Self, mounted by the intelligent Self, move along groaning,
when a man is thus going to expire <span
id="fr_506"></span>[2](sbe15076.htm#fn_506.md).

36\. 'And when (the body) grows weak through old age, or becomes weak
through illness, at that time that person, after separating himself from
his members, as an Amra (mango), or Udumbara (fig), or Pippala-fruit is
separated from the stalk, hastens back again as be came, to the place
from which he started, to (new) life.

37\. 'And as policemen, magistrates, equerries, and governors wait for a
king who is coming back, with food and drink, saying, "He comes back, he
approaches," thus do all the elements wait on him who knows this,
saying, "That Brahman comes, that Brahman approaches."

38\. 'And as policemen, magistrates, equerries, and governors gather
round a king who is departing, thus do all the senses (prâ*n*as) gather
round the Self at the time of death, when a man is thus going to
expire.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_476"></span>[161:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_476.md) The introduction
to this Brâhma*n*a has a very peculiar interest, as showing the close
coherence of the different portions which together form the historical
groundwork of the Upanishads. *G*anaka Vaideha and Yâ*gñ*avalkya are
leading characters in the B*ri*hadâranyaka-upanishad, and whenever they
meet they seem to converse quite freely, though each retains his own
character, and Yâ*gñ*avalkya honours *G*anaka as king quite as much as
*G*anaka honours Yâ*gñ*avalkya as a Brâhma*n*a. Now in our chapter we
read that Yâ*gñ*avalkya did not wish to enter on a discussion, but that
*G*anaka was the first to address him (pûrvam papra*kkh*a). This was
evidently considered not quite correct, and an explanation is given,
that *G*anaka took this liberty because on a former occasion
Yâ*gñ*avalkya had granted him permission to address questions to him,
whenever he liked. It might be objected that such an explanation looks
very much like an after-thought, and we find indeed that in India itself
some of the later commentators tried to avoid the difficulty by dividing
the words sa mene na vadishya iti, into sam enena vadishya iti, so that
we should have to translate, 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya came to *G*anaka intending
to speak with him.' (See Dvivedagaṅga's Comm. p. 1141.) This is, no
doubt, a very ingenious conjecture, which might well rouse the envy of
European scholars. But it is no more. The accents decide nothing,
because they are changed by different writers, according to their
different views of what the Pada text ought to be. What made me prefer
the reading which is supported by *S*aṅkara and Dvivedagaṅga, though the
latter alludes to the other pada*kkh*eda, is that the tmesis, sam enena
vadishye, does not occur again, while sa mene is a common phrase. But
the most interesting point, as I remarked before, is that this former
disputation between *G*anaka and Yâ*gñ*avalkya and the permission
granted to the King to ask any question he liked, is not a mere
invention to account for the apparent rudeness by which Yâ*gñ*avalkya is
forced to enter on a discussion against his will, but actually occurs in
a former chapter. In *S*atap. Br. XI, 6, 2, 10, we read: tasmai ha
Yâ*gñ*avalkyo vara*m* dadau; sa hovâ*k*a, kâmapra*sn*a <span
id="page_162">p. 162</span> eva me tvayi Yâ*gñ*avalkyâsad iti, tato
brahmâ *G*anaka âsa. This would show that *G*anaka was considered almost
like a Brâhma*n*a, or at all events enjoyed certain privileges which
were supposed to belong to the first caste only. See, for a different
view, Deussen, Vedânta, p. 203; Regnaud (Matériaux pour servir à
l'histoire de la philosophie de l'Inde), Errata; and Sacred Books of the
East, vol. i, p. lxxiii.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[162:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_477.md) Read ki*mg*yotir
as a Bahuvrîhi. Purusha is difficult to translate. It means man, but
also the true essence of man, the soul, as we should say, or something
more abstract still, the person, as I generally translate it, though a
person beyond the Ego.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[163:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_478.md) Sâmîpyalaksha*n*â
saptamî, Dvivedagaṅga. See B*ri*h. Up. IV, 4, 22.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[163:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_479.md) In this world,
while awake or dreaming; in the other world, while in deep sleep.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[163:3](sbe15075.htm#fr_480.md) The world thinks
that he thinks, but in reality he does not, he only witnesses the acts
of buddhi, or thought.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[164:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_481.md) There are really
two sthânas or states only; the place where they meet, like the place
where two villages meet, belongs to both, but it may be distinguished as
a third. Dvivedagaṅga (p. 1141) uses a curious argument in support of
the existence of another world. In early childhood, he says, our dreams
consist of the impressions of a former world, later on they are filled
with the impressions of our senses, and in old age they contain visions
of a world to come.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[164:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_482.md) By works, by
knowledge, and by remembrance of former things; see B*ri*h. Up. IV, 4,
2.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[164:3](sbe15075.htm#fr_483.md) Dividing and
separating the material, i.e. the impressions received from this world.
The commentator explains mâtrâ as a portion of the impressions which are
taken away into sleep. 'Destroying' he refers to the body, which in
sleep becomes senseless, and 'building up' to the imaginations of
dreams.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[165:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_484.md) The Mâdhyandinas
read paurusha, as an adjective to ekaha*m*sa, but Dvivedagaṅga explains
paurusha as a synonym of purusha, which is the reading of the Kâ*n*vas.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[165:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_485.md) Cf. Su*s*ruta III,
7, 1.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[165:3](sbe15075.htm#fr_486.md) I have translated
this according to the commentator, who says: 'Therefore the Self is
self-illuminated during sleep. But others say the state of waking is
indeed the same for him as sleep; there is no other intermediate place,
different from this and from the other world.... And if sleep is the
same as the state of waking, then is this Self not separate, not cause
and effect, but mixed with them, and the Self therefore not
self-illuminated. What he means <span id="page_166">p. 166</span> is
that others, in order to disprove the self-illumination, say that this
sleep is the same as the state of waking, giving as their reason that we
see in sleep or in dreams exactly what we see in waking. But this is
wrong, because the senses have stopped, and only when the senses have
stopped does one see dreams. Therefore there is no necessity for
admitting another light in sleep, but only the light inherent in the
Self. This has been proved by all that went before.' Dr. Roer takes the
same view in his translation, but Deussen (Vedânta, p. 205) takes an
independent view, and translates: I Therefore it is said: It (sleep) is
to him a place of waking only, for what he sees waking, the same he sees
in sleep. Thus this spirit serves there for his own light.' Though the
interpretations of *S*aṅkara and Dvivedagaṅga sound artificial, still
Dr. Deussen's version does not remove all difficulties. If the purusha
saw in sleep no more than what he had seen before in waking, then the
whole argument in favour of the independent action, or the independent
light of the purusha, would go; anyhow it would be no argument on
Yâ*gñ*avalkya's side. See also note to paragraph 9, before.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[166:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_487.md) The Mâdhyandinas
speak only of his return from svapnânta to buddhânta, from sleep to
waking, instead of his going from sainprasâda (deep sleep) to svapnâ
(dream), from svapnâ to buddhânta, and from buddhânta again to
svapnânta, as the Kâ*n*vas have it. In § 18 the Kâ*n*vas also mention
svapnânta and buddhânta only, but the next paragraph refers to sushupti.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[167:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_488.md) Dvivedagaṅga
explains that if phlegm predominates, qualified by wind and bile, the
juice in the veins is white; if wind predominates, qualified by phlegm
and bile, it is blue; if bile predominates, qualified by wind and
phlegm, it is yellow; if wind and phlegm <span id="page_168">p.
168</span> predominate, with little bile only, it is green; and if the
three elements are equal, it is red. See also Ânandagiri's gloss, where
Su*s*ruta is quoted. Why this should be inserted here, is not quite
clear, except that in sleep the purusha is supposed to, move about in
the veins.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[168:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_489.md) Here, again, the
commentator seems to be right, but his interpretation does violence to
the context. The dangers which a man sees in his sleep are represented
as mere imaginations, so is his idea of being of god or a king, while
the idea that he is all this (aham eveda*m* sarva*h*, i.e. ida*m*
sarvam, see *S*aṅkara, p. 873, l. 11) is represented as the highest and
real state. But it is impossible to begin a new sentence with aham
evedam sarvam, and though it is true that all the preceding fancies are
qualified by iva, I prefer to take deva and râ*g*an as steps leading to
the sarvâtmatva.

<span id="fn_490"></span>[168:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_490.md) The Mâdhyandinas
repeat here the sentence from yatra supto to pa*s*yati, from the end of
§ 19.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[168:3](sbe15075.htm#fr_491.md) The Kâ*n*va text
reads ati*kkh*andâ apahatapâpmâ. *S*aṅkara explains ati*kkh*andâ by
ati*kkh*andam, and excuses it as svâdhyâyadharma*h* pâ*th*a*h*. The
Mâdhyandinas read ati*kkh*ando, but place the whole sentence where the
Kâ*n*vas put âptakâmam &c., at the end of § 21.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[169:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_492.md) The Kâ*n*vas read
*s*okântaram, the Mâdhyandinas a*s*okântaram, but the commentators
arrive at the same result, namely, that it means *s*oka*s*ûnyam, free
from grief *S*aṅkara says: *s*okântara*m* soka*kkh*idra*m*
*s*oka*s*ûnyam ityeta*k*, *kh*okamadhyaman iti vi; sarvathâpy a*s*okam.
Dvivedagaṅga says: na vidyate *s*oko 'ntare madhye yasya tad
asokântara*m* (ra, Weber) *s*oka*s*ûnyam.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[169:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_493.md) Bhrû*n*ahan,
varish*th*abrabmahantâ.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[169:3](sbe15075.htm#fr_494.md) The son of a
*S*ûdra father and a Brâhma*n*a mother.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[169:4](sbe15075.htm#fr_495.md) The son of a
*S*ûdra father and a Kshatriya mother.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[169:5](sbe15075.htm#fr_496.md) A mendicant.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[169:6](sbe15075.htm#fr_497.md) A Vânaprastha, who
performs penances.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[169:7](sbe15075.htm#fr_498.md) I have translated
as if the text were ananvâgata*h* pu*n*yena ananvâgata*h* pâpena. We
find anvâgata used in a similar way in §§ 15, 16, &c. But the Kâ*n*vas
read ananvâgata*m* pu*n*yena ananvâgatam pâpena, and *S*aṅkara explains
the neuter by referring it to rûpam (rûpaparatvân napu*m*sakaliṅgam).
The Mâdhyandinas, if we may trust Weber's edition, read ananvâgata*h*
pu*n*yenânvâgata*h* pâpena. The second anvâgata*h* may be a mere
misprint, but Dvivedagaṅga seems to have read ananvâgatam, like the
Kâ*n*vas, for he says: ananvâgatam iti rûpavishayo
napu*m*sakanirde*s*a*h*.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[169:8](sbe15075.htm#fr_499.md) This is the old
Upanishad argument that the true sense is the Self, and not the eye.
Although therefore in the state of profound sleep, where the eye and the
other senses rest, it might be said that the purusha does not see, yet
he is a seer all the time, though he does not see with the eye. The seer
cannot lose his character <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> of seeing,
as little as the fire can lose its character of burning, so long as it
is fire. The Self sees by its own light, like the sun, even where there
is no second, no object but the Self, that could be seen.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[171:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_500.md) Salila is
explained as salilavat, like the ocean, the seer being one like the
ocean, which is one only. Dr. Deussen takes salila as a locative, and
translates it 'In dem Gewoge,' referring to *S*vetâsvatara-upanishad VI,
15.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[171:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_501.md) Or this seer is
the Brahma-world, dwells in Brahman, or is Brahman.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[172:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_502.md) An accomplished
student of the Veda.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[172:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_503.md) See Taitt. Up. II,
8, p. 59; *Kh*ând. Up. VIII, 2, 1-10; Kaush. Up. I, 3-5; Regnaud, II, p.
33 seq.

<span id="fn_504"></span>[172:3](sbe15075.htm#fr_504.md) *S*aṅkara explains
that Yâ*gñ*avalkya was not afraid that his own knowledge might prove
imperfect, but that the king, having the right to ask him any question
he liked, might get all his knowledge from him.
