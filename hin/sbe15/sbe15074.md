*The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

1\. *G*anaka Vaideha, descending from his throne, said: 'I bow to you, O
Yâ*gñ*avalkya, teach me.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'Your Majesty, as a man who wishes to make a long
journey, would furnish himself with a chariot or a ship, thus is your
mind well

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

furnished by these Upanishads <span id="fr_467"></span>[1](#fn_467). You
are honourable, and wealthy, you have learnt the Vedas and been told the
Upanishads. Whither then will you go when departing hence?'

*G*anaka Vaideha said: 'Sir, I do not know whither I shall go.'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'Then I shall tell you this, whither you will go.'

*G*anaka Vaideha said: 'Tell it, Sir.'

2\. Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'That person who is in the right eye <span
id="fr_468"></span>[2](#fn_468), he is called Indha, and him who is
Indha they call indeed <span id="fr_469"></span>[3](#fn_469) Indra
mysteriously, for the gods love what is mysterious, and dislike what is
evident.

3\. 'Now that which in the shape of a person is in the right eye, is his
wife, Virâ*g* <span id="fr_470"></span>[4](#fn_470). Their
meeting-place <span id="fr_471"></span>[5](#fn_471) is the ether within
the heart, and their food the red lump within the heart. Again, their
covering <span id="fr_472"></span>[6](#fn_472) is that which is like
net-work within the heart, and the road on which they move (from sleep
to waking) is the artery that rises upwards from the heart. Like a hair
divided into a thousand parts, so are the veins of it, which are called
Hita <span id="fr_473"></span>[7](#fn_473), placed

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

firmly within the heart. Through these indeed that (food) flows on
flowing, and he (the Tai*g*asa) receives as it were purer food <span
id="fr_474"></span>[1](#fn_474) than the corporeal Self (the
Vai*s*vânara).

4\. 'His (the Tai*g*asa's) Eastern quarter are the prâ*n*as (breath)
which go to the East;

'His Southern quarter are the prâ*n*as which go to the South;

'His Western quarter are the prâ*n*as which go to the West;

'His Northern quarter are the prâ*n*as which go to the North;

'His Upper (Zenith) quarter are the prâ*n*as which go upward;

'His Lower (Nadir) quarter are the prâ*n*as which go downward;

'All the quarters are all the prâ*n*as. And he (the Âtman in that state)
can only be described by No <span id="fr_475"></span>[2](#fn_475), no!
He is incomprehensible, for he cannot be comprehended; he is undecaying,
for he cannot decay; he is not attached, for he does not attach himself;
he is unbound, he does not suffer, he does not perish. O *G*anaka, you
have indeed reached fearlessness,'--thus said Yâ*gñ*avalkya.

Then *G*anaka said: 'May that fearlessness come to you also who teachest
us fearlessness. I bow to you. Here are the Videhas, and here am I (thy
slave).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_467"></span>[159:1](sbe15074.htm#fr_467) This refers to the
preceding doctrines which had been communicated to *G*anaka by other
teachers, and particularly to the upâsanas of Brahman as knowledge,
dear, true, endless, bliss, and certainty.

<span id="fn_468"></span>[159:2](sbe15074.htm#fr_468) See also Maitr.
Up. VII, p. 216.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[159:3](sbe15074.htm#fr_469) The Mâdhyandinas
read parokshe*n*eva, but the commentator explains iva by eva. See also
Ait. Up. I, 3, 14.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[159:4](sbe15074.htm#fr_470) Indra is called by
the commentator Vai*s*vânara, and his wife Virâ*g*. This couple, in a
waking state, is Vi*s*va; in sleep, Tai*g*asa.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[159:5](sbe15074.htm#fr_471) Sa*m*stâva, lit.
the place where they sing praises together, that is, where they meet.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[159:6](sbe15074.htm#fr_472) Prâvara*n*a may
also mean hiding-place, retreat.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[159:7](sbe15074.htm#fr_473) Hita, a name
frequently given to these nâ*d*îs; see IV, 3, 20; *Kh*ând. Up. VI, 5, 3,
comm.; Kaush. Up. IV, 20. See also Ka*th*a Up. VI, 16.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[160:1](sbe15074.htm#fr_474) Dvivedagaṅga
explains that food, when it is eaten, is first of all changed into the
coarse food, which goes away downward, and into the subtler food. This
subtler food is again divided into the middle juice that feeds the body,
and the finest, which is called the red lump.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[160:2](sbe15074.htm#fr_475) See B*ri*h. Up.
II, 3, 6; IV, 9, 26.
