## THIRD ADHYÂYA.

### FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_384"></span>[1](#fn_384.md).

Adoration to the Highest Self (Paramâtman)!

1\. *G*anaka Vaideha (the king of the Videhas) sacrificed with a
sacrifice at which many presents were offered to the priests of (the
A*s*vamedha). Brâhma*n*as of the Kurus and the Pâ*ñ*kâlas had come
thither, and *G*anaka Vaideha wished to know, which of those Brâhma*n*as
was the best read. So he enclosed a thousand cows, and ten pâdas (of
gold) <span id="fr_385"></span>[2](#fn_385.md) were fastened to each pair
of horns.

2\. And *G*anaka spoke to them: 'Ye venerable Brâhma*n*as, he who among
you is the wisest, let him drive away these cows.'

Then those Brâhma*n*as durst not, but Yâ*gñ*avalkya said to his pupil:
'Drive them away, my dear.'

He replied: 'O glory of the Sâman <span id="fr_386"></span>[3](#fn_386.md)'
and drove them away.

The Brâhma*n*as became angry and said: 'How could he call himself the
wisest among us?'

Now there was A*s*vala, the Hot*ri* priest of *G*anaka Vaideha. He asked
him: 'Are you indeed the

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

wisest among us, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya?' He replied: 'I bow before the wisest
(the best knower of Brahman), but I wish indeed to have these cows.'

Then A*s*vala, the Hot*ri* priest, undertook to question him.

1\. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya, he said, 'everything here (connected with the
sacrifice) is reached by death, everything is overcome by death. By what
means then is the sacrificer freed beyond the reach of death?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'By the Hot*ri* priest, who is Agni (fire), who is
speech. For speech is the Hot*ri* of the sacrifice (or the sacrificer),
and speech is Agni, and he is the Hot*ri*. This constitutes freedom, and
perfect freedom (from death).'

4\. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'everything here is reached by day and
night, everything is overcome by day and night. By what means then is
the sacrificer freed beyond the reach of day and night?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'By the Adhvaryu priest, who is the eye, who is
Âditya (the sun) <span id="fr_387"></span>[1](#fn_387.md). For the eye is
the Adhvaryu of the sacrifice, and the eye is the sun, and he is the
Adhvaryu. This constitutes freedom, and perfect freedom.'

5\. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'everything here is reached by the waxing
and waning of the moon, everything is overcome by the waxing and waning
of the moon. By what means then is the sacrificer freed beyond the reach
of the waxing and waning of the moon?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'By the Udgât*ri* priest, who is Vâyu (the wind),
who is the breath. For the

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

breath is the Udgât*ri* of the sacrifice, and the breath is the wind,
and he is the Udgât*ri*. This constitutes freedom, and perfect freedom.'

6\. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'this sky is, as it were, without an
ascent (staircase.) By what approach does the sacrificer approach the
Svarga world?'

Yâ*gñ*avalkya said: 'By the Brahman priest, who is the mind (manas), who
is the moon. For the mind is the Brahman of the sacrifice, and the mind
is the moon, and he is the Brahman. This constitutes freedom, and
perfect freedom. These are the complete deliverances (from death).'

Next follow the achievements.

7\. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'how many *Rik* verses will the Hot*ri*
priest employ to-day at this sacrifice?'

'Three,' replied Yâ*gñ*avalkya.

'And what are these three?'

'Those which are called Puronuvâkyâ, Yâ*g*yâ, and, thirdly,
*S*asyâ <span id="fr_388"></span>[1](#fn_388.md).'

'What does he gain by them?'

'All whatsoever has breath.'

8\. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'how many oblations (âhuti) will the
Adhvaryu priest employ to-day at this sacrifice?'

'Three,' replied Yâ*gñ*avalkya.

'And what are these three?'

'Those which, when offered, flame up; those which, when offered, make an
excessive noise; and those which, when offered, sink down <span
id="fr_389"></span>[2](#fn_389.md).'

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

'What does he gain by them?'

'By those which, when offered, flame up, he gains the Deva (god) world,
for the Deva world flames up, as it were. By those which, when offered,
make an excessive noise, he gains the Pit*ri* (father) world, for the
Pit*ri* world is excessively (noisy) <span
id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_390.md). By those which, when offered, sink
down, he gains the Manushya (man) world, for the Manushya world is, as
it were, down below.'

9\. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'with how many deities does the Brahman
priest on the right protect to-day this sacrifice?'

'By one,' replied Yâ*gñ*avalkya.

'And which is it?'

'The mind alone; for the mind is endless, and the Vi*s*vedevas are
endless, and he thereby gains the endless world.'

10\. 'Yâ*gñ*avalkya,' he said, 'how many Stotriyâ hymns will the
Udgât*ri* priest employ to-day at this sacrifice?'

'Three,' replied Yâ*gñ*avalkya.

'And what are these three?'

'Those which are called Puronuvâkyâ, Yâ*g*yâ, and, thirdly, *S*asyâ.'

'And what are these with regard to the body (adhyâtmam)?'

'The Puronuvâkyâ is Prâ*n*a (up-breathing), the Yâ*g*yâ the Apâ*n*a
(down-breathing), the *S*asyâ the Vyâna (back-breathing).'

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

'What does he gain by them?'

'He gains the earth by the Puronuvâkyâ, the sky by the Yâ*g*yâ, heaven
by the *S*asyâ.'

After that A*s*vala held his peace.

Pala*k*aturbhâga*h* pâda*h* suvar*n*asya. Comm.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[121:3](sbe15064.htm#fr_386.md) One expects iti
after uda*g*a, but Sâma*s*ravas is applied to Yâ*gñ*avalkya, and not to
the pupil. Yâ*gñ*avalkya, as the commentator observes, was properly a
teacher of the Ya*g*ur-veda, but as the pupil calls him Sâmasravas, he
shows that Yâ*gñ*avalkya knew all the four Vedas, because the Sâmans are
taken from the *Ri*g-veda, and the Atharva-veda is contained in the
other three Vedas. Regnaud, however, refers it to the pupil, and
translates, 'Ô toi qui apprends le Sâma-veda.'

<span id="fn_387"></span>[122:1](sbe15064.htm#fr_387.md) One expects
âdityena *k*akshushâ, instead of *k*akshushâdityena, but see § 6.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[123:1](sbe15064.htm#fr_388.md) The Puronuvâkyâs
are hymns employed before the actual sacrifice, the Yâ*g*yâs accompany
the sacrifice, the *S*asyâs are used for the *S*astra. All three are
called Stotriyâs.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[123:2](sbe15064.htm#fr_389.md) These oblations
are explained as consisting of wood and oil, of flesh, and of milk and
Soma. The first, when thrown on the <span id="page_124">p. 124</span>
fire, flame up. The second, when thrown on the fire, make a loud hissing
noise. The third, consisting of milk, Soma, &c., sink down into the
earth.
