*The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Note by Redactor

For reasons of Victorian modesty, Müller left certain aspects of the
Brihadâranyaka Upanishad, VI, 4, untranslated. This is because this
particular Brâhmana has passages which discuss aspects of Vedic era sex
magic. To fill in the gap, I have appended a 1921 translation of the
same Brâhmana. This is from the translation of Robert Ernest Hume, and
includes English translations of the passages Müller left untranslated.
Note that Hume uses a slightly different transcription method for
Sanskrit than the SBE system.--J. Lelievre.

## SIXTH ADHYÂYA

### FOURTH BRÂHMAṄA

**Incantations and ceremonies for procreation**

1\. Verily, of created things here earth is the essence; of earth,
water; of water, plants; of plants, flowers; of flowers, fruits; of
fruits, man (*puru<u>s</u>a*); of man, semen.

2\. Prajâpati ('Lord of creatures') bethought himself: 'Come, let me
provide him a firm basis!' So he created woman. When he had created her,
he revered her below.--Therefore one should revere woman below.--He
stretched out for himself that stone which projects. With that he
impregnated her.

3\. Her lap is a sacrificial altar; her hairs, the sacrificial grass;
her skin, the soma-press. The two labia of the vulva are the fire in the
middle. Verily, indeed, as great as is the world of him who sacrifices
with the Vâjapeya ('Strength-libation') sacrifice, so great is the world
of him who practises sexual intercourse, knowing this; he turns the good
deeds of women to himself. But he who practises sexual intercourse
without knowing this-women turn his good deeds unto themselves.

4\. This, verily, indeed, it was that Uddâlaka Âruṅi knew when he
said:--

This, verily, indeed, it was that Nâka Maudgalya knew when he said:--

This, verily, indeed, it was that Kumârahârita knew when he said: 'Many
mortal men, Brahmans by descent, go forth from this world, impotent and
devoid of merit, namely those who practise sexual intercourse without
knowing this.'

\[If\] even this much <span id="fr_675"></span>[1](#fn_675.md) semen is
spilled, whether of one asleep or of one awake, \[5\] then he should
touch it, or \[without touching\] repeat:--

'What semen has of mine to earth been spilt now,  
Whate'er to herb has flowed, whate'er to water--

This very semen I reclaim!  
Again to me let vigor come!  
Again, my strength; again, my glow!  
Again the altars and the fire  
Be found in their accustomed place!'

 

<span id="page_169hume">p. 169hume</span>

Having spoken thus, he should take it with ring-finger and thumb, and
rub it on between his breasts or his eye-brows.

6\. Now, if one should see himself in water, he should recite over it
the formula: 'In me be vigor, power, beauty, wealth, merit!'

This, verily, indeed, is loveliness among women: when she has removed
the clothes of her impurity. Therefore when she has removed the clothes
of her impurity and is beautiful, one should approach and invite her.

7\. If she should not grant him his desire, he should bribe her. If she
still does not grant him his desire, he should hit her with a stick or
with his hand, and overcome her, saying: 'With power, with glory I take
away your glory!' Thus she becomes inglorious.

8\. If she should yield to him, he says: 'With power, with glory I give
you glory!' Thus they two become glorious.

9\. The woman whom one may desire with the thought, 'May she enjoy love
with me!'--after inserting the member in her, joining mouth with mouth,
and stroking her lap, he should mutter:--

'Thou that from every limb art come,  
That from the heart art generate,  
Thou art the essence of the limbs!  
Distract this woman here in me,  
As if by poisoned arrow pierced!'

10\. Now, the woman whom one may desire with the thought, 'May she not
conceive offspring!'--after inserting the member in her and joining
mouth with mouth, he should first inhale, then exhale, and say: 'With
power, with semen, I reclaim the semen from you!' Thus she comes to be
without seed.

12\. Now, the woman whom one may desire with the thought, 'May she
conceive!'--after inserting the member in her and joining mouth with
mouth, he should first exhale, then inhale, and say: 'With power, with
semen, I deposit semen in you!' Thus she becomes pregnant.

12\. Now, if one's wife have a paramour, and he hate him, let him put
fire in an unannealed vessel, spread out a row of reed arrows in inverse
order, and therein sacrifice in inverse

<span id="page_170hume">p. 170hume</span>

order those reed arrows, their heads smeared with ghee, saying:--

'You have made a libation in my fire! I take away your in-breath and
out-breath (*prâṅâpânau*)--you, so-and-so!

You have made a libation in my fire! I take away your sons and
cattle <span id="fr_676"></span>[1](#fn_676.md)--you, so-and-so!

You have made a libation in my fire! I take away your sacrifices and
meritorious deeds <span id="fr_677"></span>[1](#fn_676.md)--you, so-and-so!

You have made a libation in my fire! I take away your hope and
expectation <span id="fr_678"></span>[1](#fn_676.md)--you, so-and-so!'

Verily, he whom a Brahman who knows this curses--he departs from this
world impotent and devoid of merit. Therefore one should not desire
dalliance with the spouse of a person learned in sacred lore
(*s'rotriya*) who knows this, for indeed he who knows this becomes
superior. <span id="fr_679"></span>[2](#fn_677.md)

13\. Now, when the monthly sickness comes upon anyone's wife, for three
days she should not drink from a metal cup, nor put on fresh clothes.
Neither a low-caste man nor a low-caste woman should touch her. At the
end of the three nights she should bathe and should have rice threshed.

14\. In case one wishes, 'That a white son be born to me! that he be
able to repeat a Veda! that he attain the full length of life!'--they
two should have rice cooked with milk and should eat it prepared with
ghee. They two are likely to beget \[him\].

15\. Now, in case one wishes, 'That a tawny son with reddish-brown eyes
be born to me! that he be able to recite two Vedas! that he attain the
full length of life!'--they two should have rice cooked with sour milk
and should eat it prepared with ghee. They two are likely to beget
\[him\].

16\. Now, in case one wishes, 'That a swarthy son with red eyes be born
to me! that he be able to repeat three Vedas! that he attain the full
length of life!'--they two should have rice boiled with water and should
eat it prepared with ghee. They two are likely to beget \[him\].

<span id="page_171hume">p. 171hume</span>

17\. Now, in case one wishes, 'That a learned (*pa<u>nd</u>ita*)
daughter be born to me! that she attain the full length of life!'--they
two should have rice boiled with sesame and should eat it prepared with
ghee. They two are likely to beget \[her\].

A. Now, in case one wishes, 'That a son, learned, famed, a frequenter of
council-assemblies, a speaker of discourse desired to be heard, be born
to me! that he be able to repeat all the Vedas! that he attain the full
length of life!'--they two should have rice boiled with meat and should
eat it prepared with ghee. They two are likely to beget \[him\], with
meat, either veal or beef.

19\. Now, toward morning, having prepared melted butter in the manner of
the Sthâlîpâka, <span id="fr_680"></span>[1](#fn_678.md) he takes of the
Sthâlîpâka and makes a libation, saying: 'To Agni, hail! To
Anumati, <span id="fr_681"></span>[2](#fn_679.md) hail! To the god
Savit*ri* ('Enlivener,' the Sun), whose is true procreation <span
id="fr_682"></span>[3](#fn_680) (*satya-prasava*.md), hail!' Having made
the libation, he takes and eats, Having eaten, he offers to the other
\[i.e. to her\]. Having washed his hands, he fills a vessel with water
and therewith sprinkles her thrice, saying:--

'Arise from hence, Vis'vavasu! <span id="fr_683"></span>[4](#fn_681.md)  
Some other choicer maiden seek!  
This wife together with her lord ----' <span
id="fr_684"></span>[5](#fn_682.md)

20\. Then he comes to her and says:--

'This man (*ama*) am I; that woman (*sâ*), thou!  
That woman, thou; this man am I!  
I am the Sâman; thou, the Rig!  
I am the heaven; thou, the earth!

Come, let us two together clasp!  
Together let us semen mix,  
A male, a son for to procure!'

 

<span id="page_172hume">p. 172hume</span>

21\. Then he spreads apart her thighs, saying: 'Spread yourselves apart,
heaven and earth!' Inserting the member in her and joining mouth with
mouth, he strokes her three times as the hair lies, saying:--

'Let Vishṅu make the womb prepared!  
Let Tyash<u>tr</u>i shape the various forms!  
Prajâpati--let him pour in!  
Let Dhât<u>r</u>i place the germ for thee!

O Sinîvâlî, give the germ;  
O give the germ, thou broad-tressed dame!  
Let the Twin Gods implace thy germ--  
The Asvins, crowned with lotus-wreaths!

22\. With twain attrition-sticks of gold  
The As'vin Twins twirl forth a flame;  
'Tis such a germ we beg for thee,  
In the tenth month to be brought forth. <span
id="fr_685"></span>[1](#fn_683.md)

As earth contains the germ of Fire (*agni*),  
As heaven is pregnant with the Storm (*indra*),  
As of the points the Wind (*vâyu*) is germ,  
E'en so a germ I place in thee,  
                        So-and-so!'

23\. When she is about to bring forth, he sprinkles her with water,
saying.--

Like as the wind doth agitate  
A lotus-pond on every side,  
So also let thy fetus stir.  
Let it come with its chorion.

This fold of Indra's has been made  
With barricade enclosed around.  
O Indra, cause him to come forth--  
The after-birth along with babe!' <span id="fr_686"></span>[2](#fn_684.md)

24\. When \[the son\] is born, he \[i. e. the father\] builds up a fire,
places him on his lap, mingles ghee and coagulated milk in a metal dish,
and makes an oblation, ladling out of the mingled ghee and coagulated
milk, and saying-

<span id="page_173hume">p. 173hume</span>

'In this son may I be increased,  
And have a thousand in mine house!  
May nothing rob his retinue  
Of offspring or of animals!  
              Hail!

The vital powers (prâ*<u>n</u>*a) which are in me, my mind, I offer in
you.

              Hail!  
What in this rite I overdid,  
Or what I have here scanty made--  
Let Agni, wise, the Prosperer,  
Make fit and good our sacrifice!  
              Hail!'

25\. Then he draws down to the child's right ear and says 'Speech!
Speech!' three times. Then he mingles coagulated milk, honey, and ghee
and feeds \[his son\] out of a gold \[spoon\] which is not placed within
\[the mouth\], <span id="fr_687"></span>[1](#fn_685.md) saying: 'I place in
you *Bhûr*! I place in you *Bhuvas*! I place in you *Svar*! *Bhûr*,
*Bhuvas*, *Svar*---everything <span id="fr_688"></span>[2](#fn_686.md) I
place in you!'

26\. Then he gives him a name, saying: 'You are Veda.' <span
id="fr_689"></span>[3](#fn_687.md) So this becomes his secret name. <span
id="fr_690"></span>[4](#fn_688.md)

27\. Then he presents him to the mother and offers the breast, saying:--

'Thy breast which is unfailing and refreshing,  
Wealth-bearer, treasure-finder, rich bestower,  
With which thou nourishest all things esteeméd--  
Give it here, O Sarasvatî, to suck from. <span
id="fr_691"></span>[5](#fn_689.md)'

28\. Then he addresses the child's mother:--

'You are I<u>l</u>â, <span id="fr_692"></span>[6](#fn_690.md) of the
lineage of Mitra and Varuṅa!  
O heroine! She has borne a hero!' <span
id="fr_693"></span>[7](#fn_691.md)  
Continue to be such a woman abounding in heroes--  
She who has made us abound in a hero!'

 

<span id="page_174hume">p. 174hume</span>

Of such a son, verily, they say: 'Ah, you have gone beyond your father!
Ah, you have gone beyond your grandfather!'

Ah, he reaches the highest pinnacle of splendor, glory, and sacred
knowledge who is born as the son of a Brahman who knows this!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_675"></span>[168hume:1](sbe15098.htm#fr_675.md) Deictically
used.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[170hume:1](sbe15098.htm#fr_678.md) These same
items recur (though not altogether verbatim) in Ka<u>t</u>ha I. 9 as
possessions of which an offender is to be deprived by an offended
Brahman.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[170hume:2](sbe15098.htm#fr_679.md) This
prohibition recurs verbatim in Pâraskara G<u>r</u>ihya Sûtras I. 11. 6;
the last phrase also in S'at. Br. 1. 6. 1. 18.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[171hume:1](sbe15098.htm#fr_680.md)
'Pot-of-cooked-food,' one of the prescribed forms of oblation, namely a
mess of barley or rice cooked with milk.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[171hume:2](sbe15098.htm#fr_681.md) Originally and
in general, the feminine personification of 'Divine Favor,' as in RV.
10. 59. 6; 10. 167. 3; VS. 34. 8, 9; AV. 1. 18. 2; 5. 7. 4; S'at. Br. 5.
2. 3. 2, 4. Specifically invoked, as here, to favor procreation at AV.
6. 131. 2; 7. 20 (21). 2. In the ritual, associated with the day of the
full moon, Ait. Br. 7. 11.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[171hume:3](sbe15098.htm#fr_682.md) Such is the
meaning especially applicable in this context. Elsewhere, e. g. VS. 10.
28; S'at. Br. 5. 3. 3. 2; 13. 4. 2. 12, this epithet of Savit<u>r</u>i
is usually taken as from another √sû, with the meaning 'whose is true
impelling.'

<span id="fn_681"></span>[171hume:4](sbe15098.htm#fr_683.md) A lecherous
demon.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[171hume:5](sbe15098.htm#fr_684.md) A loose
quotation of RV. 10. 85. 22 a, c, d.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[172hume:1](sbe15098.htm#fr_685.md) The above
three quatrains are a loose quotation of the hymn RV. 10. 184. The first
quatrain occurs also at AV. 5. 25. 5; the second (with slight
alterations) at AV. 5. 25. 3.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[172hume:2](sbe15098.htm#fr_686.md) Compare with
this the invocation for successful parturition at RV. 5. 78. 7-8.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[173hume:1](sbe15098.htm#fr_687.md) See the
similar directions at Mânava-Dharma-S'âstra 2. 29.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[173hume:2](sbe15098.htm#fr_688.md) Interpreted by
the commentators as earth, atmosphere, and heaven, i.e. the world-all;
or as Rig-Veda, Yajur-Veda, and Sâma-Veda, i.e. all knowledge.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[173hume:3](sbe15098.htm#fr_689.md) Possibly with
an added connotation, as *vedo* may be the nominative form also of
*vedas*, 'property, wealth.'

<span id="fn_688"></span>[173hume:4](sbe15098.htm#fr_690.md) in later works
this sacred ceremony of naming is found considerably elaborated. See
Âsvalâyana G<u>r</u>ihya Sûtras 1. 15. 3-8; Pâraskara G<u>r</u>ihya
Sûtras 1. 17-1-4; Gobhila Grihya Sûtras 2. 8. 14-17; and
Mânava-Dharma-S'âstra 2. 30-33.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[173hume:5](sbe15098.htm#fr_691.md) RV. 1. 164. 49
with lines b and c transposed.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[173hume:6](sbe15098.htm#fr_692.md) Or I<u>d</u>â,
goddess of refreshment in the Rig-Veda.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[173hume:7](sbe15098.htm#fr_693.md) Or, 'To a hero
she has home a hero.'
