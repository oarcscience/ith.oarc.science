# PRAS*Ñ*A-UPANISHAD.

### FIRST QUESTION.

Adoration to the Highest Self! Hari*h*, Om!

1\. Suke*s*as <span id="fr_867"></span>[1](#fn_865) Bhâradvâ*g*a <span
id="fr_868"></span>[2](#fn_866), and *S*aivya Satyakâma, and
Sauryâya*n*in <span id="fr_869"></span>[3](#fn_867) Gârgya, and
Kausalya <span id="fr_870"></span>[4](#fn_868) Â*s*valâyana, and
Bhârgava Vaidarbhi <span id="fr_871"></span>[5](#fn_869), and Kabandhin
Kâtyâyana, these were devoted to Brahman, firm in Brahman, seeking for
the Highest Brahman. They thought that the venerable Pippalâda could
tell them all that, and they therefore took fuel in their hands (like
pupils), and approached him.

2\. That *Ri*shi said to them: 'Stay here a year longer, with penance,
abstinence, and faith; then you may ask questions according to your
pleasure, and if we know them, we shall tell you all.'

3\. Then <span id="fr_872"></span>[6](#fn_870) Kabandhin Kâtyâyana
approached him and asked: 'Sir, from whence may these creatures be
born?'

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

4\. He replied: 'Pra*g*âpati (the lord of creatures) was desirous of
creatures (pra*g*â*h*). He performed penance' <span
id="fr_873"></span>[1](#fn_871), and having performed penance, he
produces a pair, matter (rayi) and spirit (prâ*n*a), thinking that they
together should produce creatures for him in many ways.

5 <span id="fr_874"></span>[2](#fn_872). The sun is spirit, matter is
the moon. All this, what has body and what has no body, is matter, and
therefore body indeed is matter.

6\. Now Âditya, the sun, when he rises, goes toward the East, and thus
receives the Eastern spirits into his rays. And when he illuminates the
South, the West, the North, the Zenith, the Nadir, the intermediate
quarters, and everything, he thus receives all spirits into his rays.

7\. Thus he rises, as Vai*s*vânara, (belonging to all men,) assuming all
forms, as spirit, as fire. This has been said in the following verse:

8 <span id="fr_875"></span>[3](#fn_873). (They knew) him who assumes all
forms, the golden <span id="fr_876"></span>[4](#fn_874), who knows all
things, who ascends highest, alone in his splendour, and warms us; the
thousand-rayed, who abides in a hundred places, the spirit of all
creatures, the Sun, rises.

9\. The year indeed is Pra*g*âpati, and there are two paths thereof, the
Southern and the Northern. Now those who here believe in sacrifices and
pious gifts as work done, gain the moon only as their

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (future) world,
and return again. Therefore the *Ri*shis who desire offspring, go to the
South, and that path of the Fathers is matter (rayi).

10\. But those who have sought the Self by penance, abstinence, faith,
and knowledge, gain by the Northern path Âditya, the sun. This is the
home of the spirits, the immortal, free from danger, the highest. From
thence they do not return, for it is the end. Thus says the
*S*loka <span id="fr_877"></span>[1](#fn_875):

11\. Some call him the father with five feet (the five seasons), and
with twelve shapes (the twelve months), the giver of rain in the highest
half of heaven; others again say that the sage is placed in the lower
half, in the chariot <span id="fr_878"></span>[2](#fn_876) with seven
wheels and six spokes.

12\. The month is Pra*g*âpati; its dark half is matter, its bright half
spirit. Therefore some *Ri*shis perform sacrifice in the bright half,
others in the other half.

13\. Day and Night <span id="fr_879"></span>[3](#fn_877) are
Pra*g*âpati; its day is spirit, its night matter. Those who unite in
love by day waste their spirit, but to unite in love by night is right.

14\. Food is Pra*g*âpati. Hence proceeds seed, and from it these
creatures are born.

15\. Those therefore who observe this rule of Pra*g*âpati (as laid down
in § 13), produce a pair, and to them belongs this Brahma-world
here <span id="fr_880"></span>[4](#fn_878). But

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

those in whom dwell penance, abstinence, and truth,

16\. To them belongs that pure Brahma-world, to them, namely, in whom
there is nothing crooked, nothing false, and no guile.'

<span id="fn_865"></span>[271:1](sbe15106.htm#fr_867) Suke*s*as seems

<span id="fn_872"></span>[272:2](sbe15106.htm#fr_874) *S*aṅkara
explains, or rather obscures, this by saying that the sun is breath, or
the eater, or Agni, while matter is the food, namely, Soma.
