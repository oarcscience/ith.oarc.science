### SIXTH ADHYÂYA.

1 <span id="fr_834"></span>[1](#fn_832). Some wise men, deluded, speak
of Nature, and others of Time (as the cause of everything <span
id="fr_835"></span>[2](#fn_833)); but it is the greatness of God by
which this Brahma-wheel is made to turn.

2\. It is at the command of him who always covers this world, the
knower, the time of time <span id="fr_836"></span>[3](#fn_834), who
assumes qualities and all knowledge <span
id="fr_837"></span>[4](#fn_835), it is at his command that this work
(creation) unfolds itself, which is called earth, water, fire, air, and
ether;

3 <span id="fr_838"></span>[5](#fn_836). He who, after he has done that
work and rested again, and after he has brought together one essence
(the self) with the other (matter), with one, two, three, or eight, with
time also and with the subtile qualities of the mind,

4\. Who, after starting <span id="fr_839"></span>[6](#fn_837) the works
endowed with (the three) qualities, can order all things, yet when, in
the absence of all these, he has caused the destruction of the work,
goes on, being in truth <span id="fr_840"></span>[7](#fn_838) different
(from all he has produced);

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

5\. He is the beginning, producing the causes which unite (the soul with
the body), and, being

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

above the three kinds of time (past, present, future), he is seen as
without parts <span id="fr_841"></span>[1](#fn_839), after we have first
worshipped that adorable god, who has many forms, and who is the true
source (of all things), as dwelling in our own mind.

6\. He is beyond all the forms of the tree <span
id="fr_842"></span>[2](#fn_840) (of the world) and of time, he is the
other, from whom this world moves round, when <span
id="fr_843"></span>[3](#fn_841) one has known him who

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

brings good and removes evil, the lord of bliss, as dwelling within the
self, the immortal, the support of all.

7\. Let us know that highest great lord of lords <span
id="fr_844"></span>[1](#fn_842), the highest deity of deities, the
master of masters, the highest above, as god, the lord of the world, the
adorable.

8\. There is no effect and no cause known of him, no one is seen like
unto him or better; his high power is revealed as manifold, as inherent,
acting as force and knowledge.

9\. There is no master of his in the world, no ruler of his, not even a
sign of him <span id="fr_845"></span>[2](#fn_843). He is the cause, the
lord of the lords of the organs <span id="fr_846"></span>[3](#fn_844),
and there is of him neither parent nor lord.

10\. That only god who spontaneously covered himself, like a spider,
with threads drawn from the first cause (pradhâna), grant us entrance
into Brahman <span id="fr_847"></span>[4](#fn_845).

11\. He is the one God, hidden in all beings, all-pervading,

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

the self within all beings, watching over all works, dwelling in all
beings, the witness, the perceiver <span
id="fr_848"></span>[1](#fn_846), the only one, free from qualities.

12 <span id="fr_849"></span>[2](#fn_847). He is the one ruler of many
who (seem to act, but really do) not act <span
id="fr_850"></span>[3](#fn_848); he makes the one seed manifold. The
wise who perceive him within their self, to them belongs eternal
happiness, not to others.

13 <span id="fr_851"></span>[4](#fn_849). He is the eternal among
eternals, the thinker among thinkers, who, though one, fulfils the
desires of many. He who has known that cause which is to be apprehended
by *S*âṅkhya (philosophy) and Yoga (religious discipline), he is freed
from all fetters.

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

14\. The <span id="fr_852"></span>[1](#fn_850) sun does not shine there,
nor the moon and the stars, nor these lightnings, and much less this
fire. When he shines, everything shines after him; by his light all this
is lightened.

15\. He is the one bird <span id="fr_853"></span>[2](#fn_851) in the
midst of the world; he is also (like) the fire (of the sun) that has set
in the ocean. A man who knows him truly, passes over death <span
id="fr_854"></span>[3](#fn_852); there is no other path to go.

16\. He makes all, he knows all, the self-caused, the knower <span
id="fr_855"></span>[4](#fn_853), the time of time (destroyer of time),
who assumes qualities and knows everything, the master of nature and of
man <span id="fr_856"></span>[5](#fn_854), the lord of the three
qualities (gu*n*a), the cause of the bondage, the existence, and the
liberation of the world <span id="fr_857"></span>[6](#fn_855).

17\. He who has become that <span id="fr_858"></span>[7](#fn_856), he is
the immortal, remaining the lord, the knower, the ever-present guardian
of this world, who rules this world for ever, for no one else is able to
rule it.

18\. Seeking for freedom I go for refuge to that God who is the light of
his own thoughts <span id="fr_859"></span>[8](#fn_857), he who

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

first creates Brahman (m.) <span id="fr_860"></span>[1](#fn_858) and
delivers the Vedas to him;

19\. Who is without parts, without actions, tranquil, without fault,
without taint <span id="fr_861"></span>[2](#fn_859), the highest bridge
to immortality--like a fire that has consumed its fuel.

20\. Only when men shall roll up the sky like a hide, will there be an
end of misery, unless God has first been known <span
id="fr_862"></span>[3](#fn_860).

21\. Through the power of his penance and through the grace of God <span
id="fr_863"></span>[4](#fn_861) has the wise *S*vetâ*s*vatara
truly <span id="fr_864"></span>[5](#fn_862) proclaimed Brahman, the
highest and holiest, to the best of ascetics <span
id="fr_865"></span>[6](#fn_863), as approved by the company of *Ri*shis.

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

22\. This highest mystery in the Vedânta, delivered in a former age,
should not be given to one whose passions have not been subdued, nor to
one who is not a son, or who is not a pupil <span
id="fr_866"></span>[1](#fn_864).

23\. If these truths have been told to a high-minded man, who feels the
highest devotion for God, and for his Guru as for God, then they will
shine forth,--then they will shine forth indeed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_832"></span>[260:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_834) See Muir, Metrical
Translations, p. 198.

<span id="fn_833"></span>[260:2](sbe15105.htm#fr_835) See before, 1, 2.

<span id="fn_834"></span>[260:3](sbe15105.htm#fr_836) The destroyer of
time. Vi*gñ*ânâtman reads kâlâkâlo, and explains it by kâlasya niyantâ,
upahartâ. *S*aṅkarânanda explains kâla*h* sarvavinâ*s*akârî, tasyâpi
vinâsakara*h*. See also verse 16.

<span id="fn_835"></span>[260:4](sbe15105.htm#fr_837) Or sarvavid ya*h*.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[260:5](sbe15105.htm#fr_838) Instead of
vinivartya, Vi*gñ*ânâtman and *S*aṅkarânanda read viniv*ri*tya.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[260:6](sbe15105.htm#fr_839) Âruhya for
ârabhya, *S*aṅkarânanda.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[260:7](sbe15105.htm#fr_840) These two verses
are again extremely obscure, and the explanations of the commentators
throw little light on their real, original meaning. To begin with
*S*aṅkara, he assumes the subject to be the same as he at whose command
this work unfolds itself, and explains <span id="page_261">p. 261</span>
tattvasya tattvena sametya yogam by âtmano bhûmyâdinâ yoga*m*
sa*m*gamayya. As the eight Tattvas he gives earth, water, fire, air,
ether, mind, thought, personality, while the Âtmagu*n*as are, according
to him, the affections of the mind, love, anger, &c. In the second
verse, however, *S*aṅkara seems to assume a different subject. 'If a
man,' he says, 'having done works, infected by qualities, should
transfer them on Î*s*vara, the Lord, there would be destruction of the
works formerly done by him, because there would be no more connection
with the self.' Something is left out, but that this is *S*aṅkara's
idea, appears from the verses which he quotes in support, and which are
intended to show that Yogins, transferring all their acts, good, bad, or
indifferent, on Brahman, are no longer affected by them. 'That person,'
*S*aṅkara, continues, 'his works being destroyed and his nature
purified, moves on, different from all things (tattva), from all the
results of ignorance, knowing himself to be Brahman.' 'Or,' he adds, 'if
we read anyad, it means, he goes to that Brahman which is different from
all things.'

*S*aṅkarânanda takes a different view. He says: 'If a man has performed
sacrifices, and has finished them, or, has turned away from them again
as vain, and if he has obtained union with that which is the real of the
(apparently) real, &c.' The commentator then asks what is that with
which he obtains union, and replies, 'the one, i.e. ignorance; the two,
i.e. right and wrong; the three, i.e. the three colours, red, white, and
black; and the eight, i.e. the five elements, with mind, thought, and
personality; also with time, and with the subtile affections of the
mind.' He then goes on, 'If that man, after having begun qualified
works, should take on himself all states (resulting from ignorance),
yet, when these states cease, there would be an end of the work, good or
bad, done by him, and when his work has come to an end, he abides in
truth (according to the Veda); while the other, who differs from the
Veda, is wrong.' *S*aṅkarânanda, however, evidently feels that this is a
doubtful interpretation, and he suggests another, viz. 'If the Lord
himself,' he says, 'determined these states (bhâva), it would seem that
there would be no end of sa*m*sâra. He therefore says, that when these
states, ignorance &c., cease, the work done by man ceases; and when the
work done ceases, the living soul gets free of sa*m*sâra, being in truth
another, i.e. different from ignorance and its products.'

Vi*gñ*ânâtman says: 'If a man, having done work, turns away <span
id="page_262">p. 262</span> from it, and obtains union of one tattva
(the tvam, or self) with the real tattva (the tat, or the Lord);--and
how? By means of the one, i.e. the teaching of the Guru; the two, i.e.
love of the Guru and of the Lord; the three, i.e. hearing, remembering,
and meditating; the eight, i.e. restraint, penance, postures, regulation
of the breath, abstraction, devotion, contemplation, and meditation
(Yoga-sûtras II, 2 9); by time, i.e. the right time for work; by the
qualities of the self, i.e. pity, &c.; by the subtile ones, i.e. the
good dispositions for knowledge, then (we must supply) he becomes free.'
And this he explains more fully in the next verse. 'If, after having
done qualified works, i.e. works to please the Lord, a Yati discards all
things, and recognises the phenomenal character of all states, and
traces them back to their real source in Mûlaprak*ri*ti and, in the end,
in the Sa*kk*idânanda, he becomes free. If they (the states) cease, i.e.
are known in their real source, the work done ceases also in its
effects, and when the work has been annihilated, he goes to freedom,
being another in truth; or, if we read anyat, he goes to what is
different from all these things, namely, to the Lord; or, he goes to a
state of perfect lordship in truth, having discovered the highest truth,
the oneness of the self with the Highest Self.'

I think that, judging from the context, the subject is really the same
in both verses, viz. the Lord, as passing through different states, and
at last knowing himself to be above them all. Yet, the other
explanations may be defended, and if the subject were taken to be
different in each verse, some difficulties would disappear.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[262:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_841) Vi*gñ*ânâtman and
*S*aṅkarânanda read akalo 'pi, without parts, and *S*aṅkara, too,
presupposes that reading, though the text is corrupt in Roer's edition.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[262:2](sbe15105.htm#fr_842) Explained as
samsârav*ri*ksha, the world-tree, as described in the Ka*th*a Up. VI, 1.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[262:3](sbe15105.htm#fr_843) It seems possible
to translate this verse in analogy with the former, and without
supplying the verb either from yâti, in verse 4, <span id="page_263">p.
263</span> or from vidâma, in verse 7. The poet seems to have said, he
is that, he is seen as that, when one has worshipped him, or when one
has known him within oneself.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[263:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_844) *S*aṅkara thinks
that the lords are Vaivasvata &c.; the deities, Indra &c.; the masters,
the Pra*g*âpatis. Vi*gñ*ânâtman explains the lords as Brahman, Vish*n*u,
Rudra, &c.; the deities as Indra, &c.; the masters as Hira*n*yagarbha,
&c. *S*aṅkarânanda sees in the lords Hira*n*yagarbha &c., in the deities
Agni &c., in the masters the Pra*g*âpatis, such as Ka*s*yapa.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[263:2](sbe15105.htm#fr_845) If he could be
inferred from a sign, there would be no necessity for the Veda to reveal
him.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[263:3](sbe15105.htm#fr_846) Kara*n*a,
instrument, is explained as organ of sense. The lords of such organs
would be all living beings, and their lord the true Lord.

<span id="fn_845"></span>[263:4](sbe15105.htm#fr_847) Besides
brahmâpyayam, i.e. brahma*n*y apyayam, ekîbhâvam, another reading is
brahmâvyayam, i.e. brahma *k*âvyaya*m* *k*a.

<span id="fn_846"></span>[264:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_848) All the MSS. seem
to read *k*etâ, not *k*ettâ.

<span id="fn_847"></span>[264:2](sbe15105.htm#fr_849) See
Ka*th*a-upanishad V, 12-15.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[264:3](sbe15105.htm#fr_850) *S*aṅkara explains
that the acts of living beings are due to their organs, but do not
affect the Highest Self, which always remains passive (nishkriya).

<span id="fn_849"></span>[264:4](sbe15105.htm#fr_851) I have formerly
translated this verse, according to the reading nityo 'nityânâ*m*
*k*etana*s* *k*etanânâm, the eternal thinker of non-eternal thoughts.
This would be a true description of the Highest Self who, though himself
eternal and passive, has to think (*g*îvâtman) non-eternal thoughts. I
took the first *k*etana*h* in the sense of *k*ettâ, the second in the
sense of *k*etana*m*. The. commentators, however, take a different, and
it may be, from their point, a more correct view. *S*aṅkara says: 'He is
the eternal of the eternals, i.e. as he possesses eternity among living
souls (*g*îvas), these living souls also may claim eternity. Or the
eternals may be meant for earth, water, &c. And in the same way he is
the thinker among thinkers.'

*S*aṅkarânanda says: 'He is eternal, imperishable, among eternal,
imperishable things, such as the ether, &c. He is thinking among
thinkers!

Vi*gñ*ânâtman says: 'The Highest Lord is the cause of eternity in
eternal things on earth, and the cause of thought in the thinkers on
earth.' But he allows another construction, namely, that he is the
eternal thinker of those who on earth are endowed with eternity and
thought. In the end all these interpretations come to <span
id="page_265">p. 265</span> the same, viz. that there is only one
eternal, and only one thinker, from whom all that is (or seems to be)
eternal and all that is thought on earth is derived.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[265:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_852) See Ka*th*. Up. V,
15; Mu*nd*. Up. II, 2, 10; Bhagavadgîtâ XV, 6.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[265:2](sbe15105.htm#fr_853) Ha*m*sa,
frequently used for the Highest Self, is explained here as hanty
avidyâdibandhakâra*n*am iti ha*m*sa*h*.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[265:3](sbe15105.htm#fr_854) Cf. III, 8.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[265:4](sbe15105.htm#fr_855) Again the MSS.
read kâlakâlo, as in verse 2. They also agree in putting *gñ*ah before
kâlakâlo, as in verse 2.

<span id="fn_854"></span>[265:5](sbe15105.htm#fr_856) Pradhânam
avyaktam, kshetra*gñ*o vi*gñ*ânâtmâ.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[265:6](sbe15105.htm#fr_857) He binds,
sustains, and dissolves worldly existence.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[265:7](sbe15105.htm#fr_858) He who seems to
exist for a time in the form of kshetra*gñ*a and pradhâna.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[265:8](sbe15105.htm#fr_859) The MSS. vary
between âtmabuddhiprakâ*s*am and âtmabuddhiprasâdam. The former reading
is here explained by *S*aṅkarânanda as svabuddhisâkshi*n*am.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[266:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_860) Explained as
Hira*n*yagarbha.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[266:2](sbe15105.htm#fr_861) Nira*ñg*ana*m*
nirlepam.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[266:3](sbe15105.htm#fr_862) *S*aṅkarânanda
reads tadâ *s*ivam avi*gñ*âya du*h*khasyânto bhavishyati; Vi*gñ*ânâtman
retains devam but mentions *s*ivam as a various reading. Both have anto,
not antam, like Roer. *S*aṅkara seems to have found na before
bhavishyati, or to have read du*h*khânto na bhavishyati, for he explains
that there will be no end of misery, unless God has first been known. It
is possible, however, that the same idea may be expressed in the text as
we read it, so that it should mean, Only when the impossible shall
happen, such as the sky being rolled up by men, will misery cease,
unless God has been discovered in the heart.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[266:4](sbe15105.htm#fr_863) The MSS, read
devaprasâdât, which is more in keeping with the character of this
Upanishad.

<span id="fn_862"></span>[266:5](sbe15105.htm#fr_864) Samyak may be both
adverb and adjective in this sentence, kâkâkshinyâyena.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[266:6](sbe15105.htm#fr_865) Atyâ*s*ramin is
explained by *S*aṅkara as atyantam pû*g*yatamâ*s*ramibhya*h*; and he
adds, *k*aturvidhâ bhikshava*s* *k*a bahûdakaku*t*î*k*akau, Ha*m*sa*h*
paramaha*m*sa*s* *k*a yo ya*h* pa*sk*ât sa uttama*h*. Weber (Indische
Studien, II, 109) has himself corrected his mistake of reading
antyâ*s*ramibhya*h*, and translating it by neighbouring hermits.

These four stages in the life of a Sannyâsin are the same to-day as they
were in the time of the Upanishads, and Dayânanda Sarasvatî <span
id="page_267">p. 267</span> describes them in his autobiography, though
in a different order: 1. Ku*t*î*k*aka, living in a hut, or in a desolate
place, and wearing a red-ochre coloured garment, carrying a
three-knotted bamboo rod, and wearing the hair in the centre of the
crown of the head, having the sacred thread, and devoting oneself to the
contemplation of Parabrahma. 2. Bahûdaka, one who lives quite apart from
his family and the world, maintains himself on alms collected at seven
houses, and wears the same kind of reddish garment. 3. Ha*m*sa, the same
as in the preceding case, except the carrying of only a one-knotted
bamboo. 4. Paramaha*m*sa, the same as the others; but the ascetic wears
the sacred thread, and his hair and beard are quite long. This is the
highest of all orders. A Paramaha*m*sa who shows himself worthy is on
the very threshold of becoming a Dîkshita.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[267:1](sbe15105.htm#fr_866) Cf. B*ri*h. Up.
VI, 3, 12; Maitr. Up. VI, 2 9.
