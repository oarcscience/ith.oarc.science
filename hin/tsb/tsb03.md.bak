### INTRODUCTION

The editor has made no changes in the antiquated form of spelling
Anglicized Sanskrit words used by Thoreau. In his own discussion the
modern form is followed.

### INTRODUCTION

THE fascination which the Orientals possessed for Thoreau is perfectly
evident to the reader who skipped no pages in *Walden* and the *Week*.
The sacred scriptures of the East held his attention through all his
creative years, and their effect on his work is so patent that even
those who have no eye for inner significance have noticed how interfused
is his prose with imported quotations and figures. F. B. Sanborn writes
in his biography of Thoreau that it was Emerson who first introduced him
to the Orientals. The date is recorded as 1837. Thoreau's *Journals*
indicate that in August, 1838, he had been reading the Persian
*Zendavesta* and Confucius, a fact which corroborates Sanborn. But the
extravagant outpouring of praise for the Orientals does not fully
commence until 1841. Between 1841 and 1843, it will be remembered,
Thoreau lived with the Emersons and assisted his elder friend in the
household tasks. There can be no doubt that he made free use of the
library. The *Journals* for these years tell eloquently of the
impression made by Emerson's Oriental books. After reading *The Laws of
Menu*, he writes, "They are the laws of you and me, a fragrance wafted
down from those old times, and no more to be refuted than the wind . . .
I remember the book as an hour before sunrise." And in another instance
he confides, "I cannot read a sentence in the book of the Hindoos
without being elevated as upon the table land of the Ghauts."

<span id="page_X">p. X</span>

There was no diminution in Thoreau's ardor for these mysterious books
through the rest of his life. The joy he found in them during his last
years was even greater than that of his first youthful discovery. The
most important story connected with this Oriental interest—that of the
Cholmondeley collection—should be better known. Because of its immediate
importance it may be related here.

In September, 1854, Thomas Cholmondeley, a friend of Arthur Hugh Clough
at Oxford, came to Concord with letters which introduced him to Emerson.
He wished to remain in Concord for a short period, but the Emersons were
not able to accommodate him and he was sent to Mrs. John Thoreau, who
took lodgers. The young Englishman was warmly welcomed by Thoreau's
mother and an intimate friendship arose between the men. The visit was
only too short. It was the time of the Crimean War; Cholmondeley went
home to enlist. Just before sailing with his regiment he sent the
following letter to his Concord friend:

*October* 3, 1855.

*My dear* THOREAU—  
I have been busily collecting a nest of Indian books for you, which,
accompanied by this note Mr. Chapman will send you, and you will find
them at Boston, carriage prepaid (mind that, and don't let them cheat
you), at Crosby and Nichols! I hope, dear Thoreau, you will accept this
trifle from one who has received so much from you, and one who

<span id="page_XIII">p. XIII</span>

is anxious to become your friend and induce you to visit England. I am
just about to start for the Crimea, being a complete soldier; but I fear
the game is nearly played, and all my friends tell me I am just too late
for the fair. When I return to England, (if ever I do return) I mean to
buy a little cottage on the south coast, where I can dwell in
*Emersonian leisure* and where I have a plot to persuade you over.

\*     \*     \*

Adieu, dear Thoreau, and immense affluence to you.

*Ever yours*,                                              
THOS. CHOLMONDELEY                  

Sanborn records that the books arrived in Concord on November 3o, 1855,
when he saw them, in the attic chamber where Thoreau kept his small
library, in cases made by his own hands, not failing to mention that
upon receiving the first announcement of their coming Thoreau had
"fashioned for these treasures a new case, out of drift wood that he had
brought home in his voyages along the Musketaquid, thus giving Oriental
wisdom an Occidental shrine."

On December 9, 1855, writing to his friend H. G. O. Blake, Thoreau
described the books in brief:

I have arranged my books in a case which I made in the meanwhile, partly
of river boards. I have not dipped far into the new ones yet. One is
splendidly bound and illuminated.

<span id="page_XIV">p. XIV</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They are in
English, French, Latin, Greek and Sanskrit. I have not made out the
significance of this godsend yet.

But by Christmas he had made out the significance of his godsend, for on
that day he wrote to the Quaker Daniel Ricketson of New Bedford that he
had received

a royal gift in the shape of twenty-one distinct works (one in nine
volumes—forty-four volumes in all) almost exclusively relating to Hindoo
literature and scarcely one of them to be bought in America. I am
familiar with many of them and know how to prize them. I send you this
information as I might of the birth of a child.

These books Thoreau cherished until the day of his death. After his
decease, they passed into the hands of his friends—principally Emerson
and Alcott.

— II —

IN the Widener Memorial Collection at the Harvard College Library is a
large sheaf of miscellaneous manuscript pages in Thoreau's handwriting.
There is neither beginning nor end to this material; it is a
disorganized mass that would require much labor to collate. One gathers
the impression that at one time these pages lay unprotected from a
sudden gust of wind which entered the room and scattered them into
confusion, only to be subsequently picked up haphazardly by a person
utterly ignorant

<span id="page_XV">p. XV</span>

of their worth. In this material I found the manuscript of Thoreau's
*The Transmigration of the Seven Brahmans*, kept intact by a pin which
had been inserted in the margin.

The story is a translation from Langlois's French rendering of the
*Harivansa*, a scholarly work of forbidding appearance that few men with
only a superficial interest in Oriental legend and metaphysics would
have tackled. The source was discovered solely through the labor of
following all the dews the manuscript offered, and searching through
every likely volume of Oriental literature to which I had access. There
is no mention, so far as I am aware, of Langlois, the French
Orientalist, in the works of any of the Concord writers. All dews as to
the nature of the story were necessarily sought in internal evidence.
The spelling of the Hindu proper names was in the French manner. This
indicated that the source from which Thoreau procured these names was
French. The second clew was the name *Bharata*, which indicated that the
story was most likely allied in some way to the great Indian epic, the
*Mahabharata*. The frequent and careful insertion of interlinear
corrections by Thoreau, which can be readily discerned in the original
long-hand draft of the story, leads to the question whether it might not
have been an original composition. The content and the technical use of
Sanskrit names, however, could scarcely have come from one uninitiated
in the original language, unless he had undertaken laborious research in
the work of European Orientalists. But Thoreau was a singular man and
his manuscript baffled even

<span id="page_XVI">p. XVI</span>

several Orientalists whom I consulted. I cannot deny that I hoped to
prove it an original composition, solely for the valuable evidence it
would have given of the Oriental tang in his mind. But the discovery
that the story was a translation from the French, on second thought
rather adds to its value. It is the first extensive evidence I have seen
of Thoreau's proficiency in French. And its Oriental value, particularly
as evidence of his interest in an extensive system of Hindu ascetic
practice—the Yoga—becomes the more significant in view of the confession
he made to Blake of the true purpose of his life. The Walden years,
also, may be viewed from another angle, for although Thoreau made his
translation in 1849 or 185o, when he drew on the Harvard College Library
for many Oriental volumes, among them being the *Harivansa*, he had long
known of the Yoga way.

— III —

I FEEL. sure that Thoreau brought himself to the task of translating
*The Transmigration of the Seven Brahmans* more because of the Yoga
philosophy which it contained than because of the story itself,
interesting as that is. I have already suggested that it throws new
light on the Walden episode of his life. Various theories have been
advanced to explain his living in a hermit's solitude for over two
years. Some have argued that it was disappointed love; others have
advanced the theory that Walden was a retreat from the smoke and noise
of an encroaching industrialism. Again one hears that he bore a grudge
against society and

<span id="page_XVII">p. XVII</span>

withdrew, like a snail, into his shell; also, that he was an incarnation
of another Rousseau, calling "Simplify! Simplify! Back to nature!" to
his generation. I have no desire to cross swords with the defenders of
these explanations. There may be truth in them all. I would, however,
advance another theory of the reason Thoreau went to Walden and it is
this: the retreat was a very natural gesture on the part of a man who
was temperamentally an ascetic, particularly one so imbued with
Orientalism. He was at all times conscious of an affinity between his
own conduct and that of a Yogi.

In the correspondence between Thoreau and H. G. O. Blake appear these
surprising words from the former's pen:

Depend upon it that, rude and careless as I am, I would fain practice
the *yoga* faithfully . . . 'The yogi, absorbed in contemplation,
contributes in his degree to creation: he breathes a divine perfume, he
hears wonderful things. Divine forms traverse him without tearing him,
and, united to the nature which is proper to him, he goes, he acts as
animating original matter.' To some extent, and at rare intervals *even
I am a yogi*.

The italics are mine. They indicate a confession that cannot be ignored.
But there is another self-revealing passage in the *Journals:*

One may discover the root of a Hindoo religion in his own private
history, when, in the silent intervals of the day or

<span id="page_XVIII">p. XVIII</span>

night, he does sometimes inflict on himself like austerities with a
stern satisfaction.

Americans will probably be chary of admitting that a Concord Yankee,
particularly a Yankee of Thoreau's independence and crispness, could in
any way be a Yogi. With justice they may well ask, "What's in a name?"
and argue that if Thoreau had written, "I would fain be a Hottentot,"
there would have been no more possibility of a change in the essential
man and a realization of his aim. Thoreau belonged to the New England
scene. In an Oriental shrine he would have been utterly incongruous.
Such a contention is irrefutable. But there is the man's intellectual
cosmopolitanism that must be taken into consideration. Moncure Conway,
who knew both Thoreau and the Orientals writes thus in his volume
*Emerson At Home and Abroad:*

Like the pious Yogi, so long motionless whilst gazing on the sun that
knotty plants encircled his neck and the cast snakeskin his loins, and
the birds built their nests on his shoulders, this poet and naturalist,
by equal consecration became a part of the field and the forest. . . .

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Conway was writing
specifically of his friend at Walden. The word of a contemporary
observer bears out Thoreau's confession.

I have already indicated, however briefly, the spirit in which Thoreau
read the Orientals. To appreciate his cosmopolitanism, one needs only to
be reminded that he lived during, and was an

<span id="page_XIX">p. XIX</span>

active figure in, the New England Renaissance, that period of
intellectual fermentation commonly called the Transcendental Period.
Concord combed the world for books during those decades. The Brahmans of
this Massachusetts village knew intimately the currents in the
thought-life of their time. So I, for one, cannot see the rustic and
uninitiated Yankee in Thoreau. He wrote of that which he knew intimately
when he wrote of the Yogi. When he applied the name to himself it may
have been in a transient, whimsical mood; but in that case I find
difficulty in understanding the following description of the manner in
which he spent a day at the Walden hut:

Sometimes, in a summer morning, having taken my accustomed bath, I sat
in my sunny doorway from sunrise till noon, rapt in revery, amidst the
pines and hickories and sumachs, while the birds sang around or flitted
noiseless through the house, until by the sun falling in at my west
window, or the noise of some traveller's wagon on the distant highway, I
was reminded of the lapse of time. I grew in those seasons like corn in
the night, and they were far better than any work of the hands would
have been. They were not time subtracted from my life, but so much over
and above my usual allowance. *I realized what the Orientals mean by
contemplation and the forsaking of works*.

There is a shadowy line between the things men sincerely believe and the
things they use for artistic purposes. No one can

<span id="page_XX">p. XX</span>

trace that line distinctly. The words of Thoreau which I have quoted—and
many others which may be had for the searching —lead me to the
conviction that his Puritan heritage and inherent sanity enabled him to
strip the Yoga practice of all the superstition and inhuman self-torture
native in India. He had no interest in the contemplation of the navel,
the drawing of thread through the nostrils, the repetition of magic
words, the bed of nails, and all the devices of hypnotism. He was
profoundly interested in the means of finding the One Bottom of the
universe. A mystic, he sensed his affinity with the sincere Yogi. But
his home was Concord, Massachusetts, so instead of taking to the
begging-bowl and the road, like his Hindu brethren, he chose Walden. I
cannot but believe that as he translated the story which comprises this
book, he thought of the waters of Walden in some ways as the waters of
Manassa, where the seven Brahman brothers sought deliverance.
