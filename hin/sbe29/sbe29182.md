*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 9.

1 <span id="fr_816"></span>[1](#fn_815). Now (follow.md) the five great
sacrifices.

2 <span id="fr_817"></span>[2](#fn_816.md). Of the Vai*s*vadeva food he
should, after having sprinkled (water) round (the sacred fire), make
oblations, with the word Svâhâ (each time repeated), to Brahman, to
Pra*g*âpati, to the (deities) of the house, to Ka*s*yapa, and to
Anumati.

3 <span id="fr_818"></span>[3](#fn_817.md). To the domestic deities (he
offers) three

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Balis) in the
water-pot: to Par*g*anya, to the waters, to the Earth;

4\. To Dhât*ri* and Vidhât*ri* at the two doorposts;

5\. To the different quarters (of the horizon), to Vâyu and (to the
presiding deities) of the quarters;

6\. In the middle three (Balis) to Brahman, to the Air, to the Sun.

7\. To the north of those (he offers Balis) to the Vi*s*ve devâs and to
all the beings;

8\. Further on to Ushas and to the Lord of beings;

9\. To the south (to the Fathers) with (the words), To the Fathers,
Svadhâ! Adoration!'

10\. Having rinsed out the vessel, he should pour it out towards the
north-west with (the words), 'Consumption! this to thee!'

11 <span id="fr_819"></span>[11](#fn_818.md). Taking the Brâhma*n*a's
portion (of the food which he is going to distribute), he should give it
to a Brâhma*n*a, after he has made him wash himself, with (the words),
'Well! (this) to thee!'

12\. To (religious) mendicants and to guests they should apportion
(food) as due to them.

13\. The persons belonging to the house, the young and the old, should
eat what is due to them;

14\. Afterwards the householder and his wife.

15 <span id="fr_820"></span>[15](#fn_819.md). Or the householder (should
eat) first, because

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

the *S*ruti says, 'Therefore the householder should eat the sweetest
food before his guests.'

16 <span id="fr_821"></span>[16](#fn_820.md). Every day he should sacrifice
with the word svâhâ. If he has no food (to offer, he should make his
offering) with something else, be it even a piece of wood (only), to the
gods, or be it (only) a water-pot, to the Fathers and to men.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_815"></span>[319:1](sbe29182.htm#fr_816.md) 9, 1. The five
Mahâya*gñ*as are, the sacrifice to the gods, the sacrifice to living
Beings, the sacrifice to the Fathers, the sacrifice to the Brahman, the
sacrifice to men. As to the meaning of the five categories, see
Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya III, 1.

<span id="fn_816"></span>[319:2](sbe29182.htm#fr_817.md) Compare above, I,
12, 3.

<span id="fn_817"></span>[319:3](sbe29182.htm#fr_818.md) Compare above, I,
12, 2.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[320:11](sbe29182.htm#fr_819.md) What I have
translated 'the Brâhma*n*a's portion' is agra. See on this word the
remark of Nîlaka*nth*a quoted by Böhtlingk-Roth s*v*. agrahâra: agra*m*
brâhma*n*abho*g*ana*m*, tadartha*m* hriyante râ*g*adhanât
p*ri*thakkriyante te<sup>ऽ</sup>grahârâ*h* kshetrâdaya*h*. According to
different commentators and lexicographers one Agra is equal to four or
to sixteen mouthfuls of food.

<span id="fn_819"></span>[320:15](sbe29182.htm#fr_820.md) I cannot indicate
any more than Professor Stenzler could, where the passage here quoted
occurs in a Brâhma*n*a.
