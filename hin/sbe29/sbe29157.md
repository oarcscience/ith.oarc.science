### KA*ND*IKÂ 3.

1 <span id="fr_676"></span>[1](#fn_675). To six persons the Arghya
reception is due: to a teacher, to an officiating priest, to the
father-in-law, to the king, to a friend, to a Snâtaka.

2 <span id="fr_677"></span>[2-3](#fn_676). They should honour them (with
the Arghya reception) once a year.

3\. But officiating priests (they should receive) whenever they intend
to perform a sacrifice.

4\. Having ordered a seat to be got (for the guest), he says, 'Well,
sir! sit down! We will do honour to you, sir!'

5\. They get for him a couch (of grass) to sit down on, another for the
feet, water for washing the feet, the Argha water, water for sipping,
and the honey-mixture, i.e. curds, honey, and ghee, in a brass vessel
with a brass cover.

6 <span id="fr_678"></span>[6](#fn_677). Another person three times
announces (to the guest) the couch and the other things (when they are
offered to him).

7\. He accepts the couch.

8 <span id="fr_679"></span>[8](#fn_678). He sits down thereon with (the
verse), 'I am the highest one among my people, as the sun among the
thunder-bolts. Here I tread on whosoever infests me.'

9 <span id="fr_680"></span>[9-10](#fn_679). With the feet (he treads) on
the other (bundle of grass).

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

10\. When he is seated on the couch, he washes (for his guest) the left
foot and then the right foot.

11 <span id="fr_681"></span>[11](#fn_680). If (the host) is a
Brâhma*n*a, the right first.

12 <span id="fr_682"></span>[12](#fn_681). (He does so) with (the
formula), 'The milk of Virâ*g* art thou. The milk of Virâ*g* may I
obtain. (May) the milk of Padyâ Virâ*g* (dwell) in me.'

13 <span id="fr_683"></span>[13](#fn_682). He accepts the Arghya water
with (the words), 'Waters are ye. May I obtain through you all my
wishes.'

14\. Pouring it out he recites over (the waters the formula), 'To the
ocean I send you; go back to your source. Unhurt be our men. May my sap
not be shed.'

15\. He sips water with (the formula), 'Thou camest to me with glory.
Unite me with lustre. Make me beloved by all creatures, the lord of
cattle, unhurtful for the bodies.'

16 <span id="fr_684"></span>[16](#fn_683). With (the formula), 'With
Mitra’s' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h., Kâ*n*va*s*âkhâ II, 3, 4) he looks at the
Madhuparka.

17 <span id="fr_685"></span>[17](#fn_684). With (the formula), 'By the
impulse of the god Savit*ri*' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. l.l.) he accepts it.

18 <span id="fr_686"></span>[18](#fn_685). Taking it into his left hand
he stirs it about

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

three times with the fourth finger of his right hand with (the formula),
'Adoration to the brown-faced One. What has been damaged in thee, when
the food was eaten, that I cut off from thee.'

19\. And with the fourth finger and the thumb he spirts away (some part
of the Madhuparka) three times.

20\. He partakes of it three times with (the formula), 'What is the
honied, highest form of honey, and the enjoyment of food, by that
honied, highest form of honey, and by that enjoyment of food may I
become highest, honied, and an enjoyer of food.'

21 <span id="fr_687"></span>[21](#fn_686). Or with (the verses) that
contain the word 'honey,' verse by verse.

22 <span id="fr_688"></span>[22](#fn_687). Let him give the remainder
(of the Madhuparka) to a son or a pupil who is sitting to the north.

23 <span id="fr_689"></span>[23](#fn_688). Or let him eat the whole of
it (himself).

24 <span id="fr_690"></span>[24](#fn_689). Or he should pour out (the
remainder) to the east, at an unfrequented spot.

25\. Having sipped water, he touches his bodily organs with (the
formula), 'May speech dwell in my mouth, breath in my nose, sight in my
eyes, hearing in my ears, strength in my arms, vigour in my thighs. May
my limbs be unhurt, may my body be united with my body!'

26\. When (the guest) has sipped water, (the host), holding a butcher's
knife, says to him three times, 'A cow!'

27\. He replies, 'The mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus,
the sister of the Âdityas, the

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

navel of immortality. To the people who understand me, I say, "Do not
kill the guiltless cow, which is Aditi." I kill my sin and N.N.'s
sin,'—thus, if he chooses to have it killed.

28\. But if he chooses to let it loose, he should say, 'My sin and
N.N.'s sin has been killed. Om! Let it loose! Let it eat grass!'

29 <span id="fr_691"></span>[29-30](#fn_690). But let the Argha not be
without flesh.

30\. On the occasion of a sacrifice and of a wedding let (the guest)
say, 'Make it (ready).'

31 <span id="fr_692"></span>[31](#fn_691). Even if he performs more than
one Soma sacrifice during one year, let only priests who have received
(from him) the Arghya reception, officiate for him, not such who have
not received it; for this has been prescribed in the *S*ruti.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_675"></span>[273:1](sbe29157.htm#fr_676) 3, 1. On vaivâhya,
which I have translated father-in-law,' comp. the note on *S*âṅkhâyana
II, 15, I.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[273:2-3](sbe29157.htm#fr_677) 2, 3. Comp.
below, Sûtra 31, and *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya II, 15, 10.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[273:6](sbe29157.htm#fr_678)
Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I, 24, 7.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[273:8](sbe29157.htm#fr_679) I have translated
according to the reading of Â*s*valâyana (l.l. § 8), vidyutâm instead of
udyatâm.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[273:9-10](sbe29157.htm#fr_680) 9, 10. There is
no doubt that these Sûtras should be divided <span id="page_274">p.
274</span> thus: pâdayor anya*m*. vish*t*ara asînâya savya*m* pâda*m*
prakshâlya dakshi*n*a*m* prakshâlayati. Thus it is said in the
Khâdira-G*ri*hya: vish*t*aram âstîrya . . . adhyâsîta. pâdayor dvitiyayâ
(scil. *rik*â) dvau *k*et. Gobhila has the Sûtra: pâdayor anyam.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[274:11](sbe29157.htm#fr_681) The words
brâhma*n*a*s* *k*et refer to the host, as the comparison of Â*s*valâyana
I, 24, 11, shows.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[274:12](sbe29157.htm#fr_682) Comp.
Â*s*valâyana l.l. § 22; *S*âṅkhâyana III, 7, 5.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[274:13](sbe29157.htm#fr_683) The play on words
(âpas = waters, avâpnavâni = may I obtain) is untranslatable.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[274:16](sbe29157.htm#fr_684)
Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I, 24, 14.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[274:17](sbe29157.htm#fr_685)
Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I, 24, 15.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[274:18](sbe29157.htm#fr_686)
Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya l.l. Anna*s*ane instead of annâ*s*ane is simply a
mistake in spelling.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[275:21](sbe29157.htm#fr_687) These are the
three verses, Vâ*g*. Sa*m*hitâ XIII, 27-29.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[275:22](sbe29157.htm#fr_688)
Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I, 24, 25.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[275:23](sbe29157.htm#fr_689) Â*s*valâyana l.l.
§ 27.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[275:24](sbe29157.htm#fr_690) Â*s*valâyana l.l.
§ 26.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[276:29-30](sbe29157.htm#fr_691) 29, 30. These
Sûtras are identical with two Sûtras in the *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya II,
15, 2.3. See the note there. It seems to me inadmissible to translate §
29, as Professor Stenzler does: Der Argha darf aber nicht immer ohne
Fleisch sein.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[276:31](sbe29157.htm#fr_692)
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya II, 15, 10.
