### KHA*ND*A 13.

1\. Under (the Nakshatra) Rohi*n*î he shall have the ploughing done.

2\. Before it is done, he shall offer at the eastern boundary of his
field a Bali to Heaven and Earth.

3\. With a verse sacred to Heaven and Earth and with the words,
'Adoration to Heaven and Earth!' (he performs his) worship (to Heaven
and Earth).

4\. When the plough is being put into motion first, let a Brâhma*n*a
touch the plough reciting this (verse), 'For luck may us the
plough-shares' (Rig-veda IV, 57, 8).

5\. 'Through the lord of the field'—with (this hymn) (Rig-veda IV, 57),
verse by verse, to the different directions (of the sky), from left to
right, worship is done.
