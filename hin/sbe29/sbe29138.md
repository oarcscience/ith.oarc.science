### KA*ND*IKÂ 5.

1\. Now (follows) the Adhyâyopâkara*n*a (i.e. the ceremony by which the
annual course of study is opened);

2 <span id="fr_535"></span>[2-3](#fn_534). When the herbs appear, (when
the moon stands in conjunction) with *S*rava*n*a, in the *S*râva*n*a
month,

3\. Or on the fifth (Tithi of that month), under (the Nakshatra) Hasta.

4 <span id="fr_536"></span>[4](#fn_535). Having sacrificed the two
Â*g*ya portions, he should offer Â*g*ya oblations (to the following
deities, viz.) Sâvitrî, Brahman, Belief, Insight, Wisdom, Memory,
Sadasaspati, Anumati, the metres, and the *Ri*shis.

5\. He then sacrifices grains with curds (with the following texts):

6\. 'I praise Agni the Purohita'—this one verse (Rig-Veda I, 1, 1),

7 <span id="fr_537"></span>[7](#fn_536). 'The Kushumbhaka (mungoose?)
has said it'—'If thou criest, O bird, announce luck to us Sung by
*G*amadagni'—'In thy abode the whole world rests'

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —'Come to our
sacrifice, O you that are worthy of sacrifice, with care'—'Whosoever, be
he ours, be he alien'—'Look on, look about'—'Come here, Agni, the
Maruts' friend'—'The oblation, O king, cooked for thee'—each time two
verses;

8\. 'United is your will' (Rig-veda X, 191, 4)—this one verse;

9 <span id="fr_538"></span>[9](#fn_537). 'That blessing and bliss we
choose'—this one verse.

10 <span id="fr_539"></span>[10](#fn_538). When he intends to study (the
Veda together with pupils), he should, while the pupils take hold of
him, sacrifice to those deities, and sacrifice to (Agni)
Svish*t*ak*ri*t, and partake of the grains with curds; then (follows)
the 'cleaning.'

11 <span id="fr_540"></span>[11](#fn_539). Sitting down to the west of
the fire on Darbha grass, the tufts of which are directed towards the
east, he should put Darbha blades into a water-pot, and making a
Brahmâ*ñg*ali (i.e. joining his hands as a sign of veneration for the
Brahman), he should murmur (the following texts):

12\. The Vyâh*ri*tis preceded by (the syllable) Om (stand first);
(these) and the Sâvitrî he should repeat three times and then recite the
beginning of the Veda.

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

13\. In the same way at the Utsarga (i.e. at the ceremony performed at
the end of the term of Vedic study).

14\. He should study six months.

15 <span id="fr_541"></span>[15](#fn_540). One who has performed the
Samâvartana (should live during that time) according to the regulations
for Brahma*k*ârins.

16 <span id="fr_542"></span>[16](#fn_541). The others according to the
rules.

17 <span id="fr_543"></span>[17](#fn_542). Some say that he should have
intercourse with his wife.

18\. That (is a practice) sacred to Pra*g*âpati.

19\. This (Upâkara*n*a) they call vârshika (i.e. belonging to the rainy
season).

20 <span id="fr_544"></span>[20](#fn_543). On the middle Ash*t*akâ they
offer food to those deities, and descend into water.

21\. They satiate those same deities (with water oblations),

22\. (And besides) the Â*k*âryas, the *Ri*shis, and the Fathers.

23 <span id="fr_545"></span>[23](#fn_544). This is the Utsar*g*ana.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[221:2-3](sbe29138.htm#fr_535) 5, 2, 3. Perhaps
the division of these Sûtras should be altered, so that *s*râva*n*asya
would belong to Sûtra 2. In this case we should have to translate, '2.
When the herbs appear, (on a day on which the moon stands in
conjunction) with *S*rava*n*a. 3. Or on the fifth (Tithi) of the
*S*râva*n*a month, under (the Nakshatra) Hasta.' Comp. *s*râva*n*asya
pa*ñk*amîm, Par. II, 10, 2. If we count the month beginning with the
bright fortnight, and assume that the full moon day of *S*râva*n*a
falls, as the name of the month implies, on *S*rava*n*a, the fifth Tithi
of that month will fall indeed on Hasta. Comp. on the dates of the
Upâkara*n*a, Prof. Weber's remarks, Die vedischen Nachrichten von den
Naxatra II, 322, and on the special symbolical signification of the
Nakshatra *S*rava*n*a in this connection, my note on *S*âṅkhâyana IV, 5,
2.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[221:4](sbe29138.htm#fr_536) On the two Â*g*ya
portions, comp. above, I, 3, 5; 10, 13 seqq.

<span id="fn_536"></span>[221:7](sbe29138.htm#fr_537) Comp. *S*âṅkhâyana
IV, 5, 8. The verses with which the oblations are performed, are the
first and last verses of each Ma*nd*ala.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[222:9](sbe29138.htm#fr_538) This is the last
verse of the *Ri*k-Sa*m*hitâ in the Bâshkala *S*âkhâ. See my note on
*S*âṅkhâyana IV, 5, 9.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[222:10](sbe29138.htm#fr_539) The expression,
'Those deities' would, according to Nârâya*n*a, refer not only to the
deities stated in Sûtra 4, but also to the deities of the first and last
verses of the Ma*nd*alas (Sûtras 6 seqq.). On the grains with curds,
comp. Sûtra 5. The technical sense of the 'cleaning' is explained in the
*S*rauta-sûtra I, 8, 2; comp. Hillebrandt, Das altindische Neu- and
Vollmondsopfer, p. 130, note 1. The sacrificer covers his joined hands
with the Ku*s*a grass spread out round the fire, and has water sprinkled
on them.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[222:11](sbe29138.htm#fr_540) On the term
brahmâ*ñg*ali, comp. Manu II, 71.

<span id="fn_540"></span>[223:15](sbe29138.htm#fr_541) On the
Samâvartana, see below, chap. 8 seq. The restrictions referred to
consist in the interdiction of eating honey and meat, of having sexual
intercourse, of sleeping in a bedstead and in the day-time, &c.
Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[223:16](sbe29138.htm#fr_542) I.e. the
Brahma*k*ârins.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[223:17](sbe29138.htm#fr_543) I.e. one who has
performed the Samâvartana.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[223:20](sbe29138.htm#fr_544) After the six
months (Sûtra 14) have elapsed, on the Ash*t*akâ of Mâgha.
