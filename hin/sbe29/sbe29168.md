*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 14.

1\. Now the Pu*m*savana (i.e. the ceremony to secure the birth of a male
child),

2\. Before (the child in his mother's womb) moves, in the second or
third month (of pregnancy).

3 <span id="fr_733"></span>[3](#fn_732.md). On a day on which the moon
stands in conjunction with a Nakshatra (that has a name) of masculine
gender, on that day, after having caused (his wife) to fast, to bathe,
and to put on two garments which have not yet been washed, and after
having in the night-time crushed in water descending roots and shoots of
a Nyagrodha tree, he inserts (that into her right nostril) as above,
with the two (verses),

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'The gold-child'
(Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XIII, 4) and 'Formed of water' (ibid. XXXI, 17);

4 <span id="fr_734"></span>[14\_4](#fn_733.md). A Ku*s*a needle and a Soma
stalk, according to some (teachers).

5 <span id="fr_735"></span>[5](#fn_734.md). And he puts gall of a tortoise
on her lap.

If he desires; 'May (the son) become valiant,' he recites over him (i.e.
over the embryo), modifying the rite (?), 'The Supar*n*a art thou'
(Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XII, 4), (the Ya*g*us) before (the formulas called)
'steps of Vish*n*u.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_732"></span>[291:3](sbe29168.htm#fr_733.md) 14, 3. The words
'as above' refer to chap. 13, 1.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[292:14\_4](sbe29168.htm#fr_734.md) Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 20, 3.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[292:5](sbe29168.htm#fr_735.md) The commentators
state that kûrmapitta (gall of tortoise) means 'a dish with water.' I
place no confidence in this statement, though I cannot show at present
what its origin is. I am not sure about the translation of vik*ri*tyâ
(or vik*ri*tya?). But it seems impossible to me that it should be the
name of the metre Vik*ri*ti. 'Steps of Vish*n*u' is a name for the
Ya*g*us following in the Sa*m*hitâ on the one prescribed in this Sûtra.
It begins, 'Vish*n*u’s step art thou, &c.' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XII, 5).
