### PA*T*ALA II, KHA*ND*A 1.

1 <span id="fr_1004"></span>[1-3](#fn_1003.md). Of the sacrifices of the
new and full moon, the full-moon sacrifice should be performed first.

2\. If (the term for the sacrifice) of the new moon comes first, he
should first celebrate the full-moon sacrifice and then perform that.

3\. Some say that he should not perform it, and wait till the day of the
full moon.

4 <span id="fr_1005"></span>[4](#fn_1004.md). In the afternoon, husband and
wife, after having bathed, should eat fast-day food.

5 <span id="fr_1006"></span>[5-8](#fn_1005.md). Mânadantavya has said: 'He
who eats fast-day food, obtains offspring better than himself; he gains
favour; hunger will not attack him.'

6\. Therefore one should eat (fast-day food) which he likes.

7\. He should do nothing unholy (such as cohabiting with his wife).

8\. After he has sacrificed the morning oblation,

9 <span id="fr_1007"></span>[9-16](#fn_1006.md). He should pour out the
sacrificial food with (the formula), 'Agreeable to such and such (a
deity) I pour thee out:' (this formula) referring to the

deity, or a Ya*g*us, (is repeated) once; twice (it is done) silently.

10\. He should wash (the food) thrice, (if it is destined) for gods;

11\. Twice, if for men;

12\. Once, if for the Fathers.

13\. Stirring it up with the pot-ladle from the left to the right he
should cook it.

14\. When he has cooked it, he should sprinkle (Â*g*ya) on it, should
take it from the fire towards the north, and should again sprinkle
(Â*g*ya) on it.

15\. Thus all kinds of Havis (are prepared).

16\. Having put (the Havis) on the sacrificial grass,

17 <span id="fr_1008"></span>[17-27](#fn_1007.md). He should sacrifice the
two Â*g*ya portions (in the following way): Having taken four portions
of Â*g*ya—five portions are taken by the Bh*ri*gus (or at least?) by the
*G*âmadagnyas \[see Indische Studien, 10, 95\]—(he should make two
oblations), to the north with (the formula), 'To Agni Svâhâ!' to the
south with (the formula), 'To Soma Svâhâ!'

18\. Others (do it) conversely.

19\. Having 'spread under' Â*g*ya, he should cut off with the pot-ladle
(portions) of the Havis from the middle and from the eastern side;

20\. One who takes five cut-off portions (see Sûtra 17), also from the
western side.

21\. After he has sprinkled (Â*g*ya) on (the cut-off portions), he
anoints the places from which he has cut them off, (with Â*g*ya).

22\. (This anointing) is omitted at the Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation.

23\. He should sacrifice with (the formula), 'To N.N. Svâhâ!'—according
to the god to whom the oblation belongs.

24\. At the Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation he 'spreads under' once—twice if he
is a Bh*ri*gu—(cuts off) once (a portion) of the Havis, sprinkles
(Â*g*ya) on it twice, and sacrifices it in a north-eastern direction
with (the formula), 'To Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t Svâhâ!

25\. Having put a piece of wood (on the fire),

26\. He should dip Darbha-blades (of the sacrificial grass strewn round
the fire) three times, the points, the middle, and the roots, into the
Â*g*ya or into the Havis with (the words), 'May the birds come, licking
what has been anointed.' Then, after having sprinkled (those
Darbha-blades with water), he should throw them into the fire, with (the
verse), 'Thou who art the lord of cattle, Rudra, who walkest with the
lines (of cattle), the manly one: do no harm to our cattle; let this be
offered to thee. Svâhâ!'

27\. This (ceremony is called) Ya*gñ*avâstu.

28 <span id="fr_1009"></span>[28](#fn_1008.md). He should perform it at all
(sacrifices).

29 <span id="fr_1010"></span>[29-31](#fn_1009.md). The remnants of the
Havis he should take away in a northern direction, and should give them
to the Brahman.

30\. A full vessel constitutes the fee for the sacrifice;

31\. Or as much as he can afford.
