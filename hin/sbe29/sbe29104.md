*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 5.

1 <span id="fr_378"></span>[5\_1](#fn_377.md). Let him first examine the
family (of the intended bride or bridegroom), as it has been said above,

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Those who on the
mother's and on the father's side.'

2\. Let him give the girl to a (young man) endowed with intelligence.

3\. Let him marry a girl that shows the characteristics of intelligence,
beauty, and moral conduct, and who is free from disease.

4 <span id="fr_379"></span>[4](#fn_378.md). As the characteristics
(mentioned in the preceding Sûtra) are difficult to discern, let him
make eight lumps (of earth), recite over the lumps the following
formula, 'Right has been born first, in the beginning; on the right
truth is founded. For what (destiny) this girl is born, that may she
attain here. What is true may that be seen,' and let him say to the
girl, 'Take one of these.'

5 <span id="fr_380"></span>[5](#fn_379.md). If she chooses the (lump of
earth taken) from a field that yields two crops (in one year), he may
know, 'Her offspring will be rich in food.' If from a cow-stable, rich
in cattle. If from the earth of a Vedi (altar), rich in holy lustre. If
from a pool which does not dry up, rich in everything. If from a
gambling-place, addicted to gambling. If from a place where four roads
meet, wandering to different directions. If from a barren spot, poor. If
from a burial-ground, (she will) bring death to her husband.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_377"></span>[164:5\_1](sbe29104.htm#fr_378.md) 5, 1.
*S*rauta-sûtra IX, 3, 20, 'Who on their mother's as well as <span
id="page_165">p. 165</span> on their father's side through ten
generations are endowed with knowledge, austerity, and meritorious
works,' &c.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[165:4](sbe29104.htm#fr_379.md) I prefer the
reading of the Bibliotheca Indica edition, countenanced by Nârâya*n*a's
commentary, durvi*gñ*eyâni laksha*n*ânîti, &c. The lumps are to be taken
from the eight places mentioned in Sûtra 5.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[165:5](sbe29104.htm#fr_380.md) No doubt the
correct reading is not that given by Nârâya*n*a and accepted by
Professor Stenzler, dvipravrâ*g*inî, but vipravrâ*g*inî, as four of
Professor Stenzler's MSS. read (see his Variae Lectiones, p. 48, and the
Petersburg Dictionary s. v. vipravrâ*g*in).
