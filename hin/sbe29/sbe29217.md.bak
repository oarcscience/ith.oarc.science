29\. (The teacher) should sing (those verses) to (the student) who has
fasted and veiled his eyes (thinking), 'May (the teacher) not burn me
(with the *S*akvarî verses).'

30\. In the morning they make (the student) look at such things as they

31\. At water (he should look) with (the words), 'Water have I beheld!'
At fire with (the words), 'Light have I beheld!' At the calf with (the
