### ADHYÂYA IV, KHA*ND*A 1.

1 <span id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_230.md). Let him offer (*S*râddha
oblations) every month to the fathers.

2 <span id="fr_232"></span>[2](#fn_231.md). Having invited an uneven number
of Brâhma*n*as, versed in the Veda, at least three, to sit down as
(representing) the fathers,

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

3\. And having strewn sesamum into an uneven number of water-pots,

4\. He shall pour them out over the hands of the Brâhma*n*as, assigning
(this gift) to them with the words, 'N.N.! This to thee!'

5 <span id="fr_233"></span>[5-7](#fn_232.md). After this they should be
adorned;

6\. And after he has (respectfully) spoken to them, and has put food
into the fire,

7\. Assigning (the food) to them with the words, 'N.N.! This to thee!'
he shall cause them to eat.

8\. While they are eating, he shall murmur the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis, the
Sâvitrî, the Madhuvâtîya-verses (Rig-veda I, 90, 6 seq.), and verses
addressed to the Manes and to (Soma) Pavamâna.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

9 <span id="fr_234"></span>[9](#fn_233.md). When they have finished with
eating, he shall offer the lumps (of flour).

10 <span id="fr_235"></span>[10-11](#fn_234.md). Before (their dinner he
shall offer) the lumps, according to some (teachers).

11\. Behind (these he places the lumps) for their wives, putting
something between (these and the preceding ones).

12\. To the Brâhma*n*as he shall announce the remnants.

13 <span id="fr_236"></span>[13](#fn_235.md). The rites of the putting (of
food) into the fire (see Sûtra 6), &c. have been declared (in the
*S*rauta-sûtra) by the Pi*nd*apit*ri*ya*gñ*a.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_230"></span>[106:1](sbe29063.htm#fr_231.md) 1, 1. Kha*nd*as
1-4 contain the rules regarding the *S*râddha oblations directed to the
Manes. The dinners offered in connection with these *S*râddha sacrifices
to Brâhma*n*as and also—though of this of course no notice is taken in
Vedic texts—to *S*rama*n*as stood in the first line among the
exhibitions of liberality of lay people towards priests and monks. Thus
we find among the stock phrases that constantly reoccur in the Pâli
Pi*t*akas, the mention of Sama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as 'who have eaten the
food given to them out of faith' (saddhâdeyyâni bho*g*anâni
bhu*ñg*itvâ)—wherein the 'food given out of faith' (saddhâdeyya) either
chiefly or exclusively means the *S*râddha dinners, which are so called
because the sacrificer gives them 'full of faith' (*s*raddhâsamanvita,
Manu III, 275) to the Brâhma*n*as and through them to the Manes.

The principal form of *S*râddha is that treated of in chap. 1, which is
designated in other texts (see, for instance, Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya IV,
7, 1) as pârva*n*a *s*râddha. There are, however, besides the parvan of
the new moon, other times also considered as admissible for the
performing of this monthly *S*râddha; see Gautama XV, 2 seq.; Âpastamba
II, 16, &c.; and comp. on the *S*râddhas in general the passages quoted
by Professor Jolly, Das Dharma-sûtra des Vish*n*u (Sitzung der Bair.
Akademie, phil. Classe, 7 Juni, 1879), pp. 46 seq.; Max Müller, 'India,
what can it teach us?' pp. 234 Seq., 374 seq.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[106:2](sbe29063.htm#fr_232.md) '"As the fathers"
means: he invites the youngest, middle-aged, and eldest Brâhma*n*as to
sit down in the place of the father, the grandfather, and the
great-grandfather' (Nârâya*n*a). A similar explanation of pit*ri*vat is
mentioned by Nârâya*n*a on Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya <span id="page_107">p.
107</span> IV, 7, 2. My German translation of this Sûtra ought to be
altered accordingly.

Besides the Brâhma*n*as mentioned in this Sûtra, who represent the
fathers, according to all the commentaries, other Brâhma*n*as had to be
invited as representing the Vi*s*ve devâs. Nârâya*n*a gives detailed
statements as to the number of the pait*ri*ka and of the daivika
Brâhma*n*as to be invited, and though at first sight a European reader
would rather be inclined to doubt whether at the *S*râddha ceremony, as
the author of the text intended to describe it, any Brâhma*n*as at all
had to be present except the pait*ri*kas, the Sûtra 2, 5 shows that the
commentators are quite right in their statements regarding both
categories of Brâhma*n*as.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[107:5-7](sbe29063.htm#fr_233.md) It would be more
natural to alter the division of the Sûtras, so as to bring âmantrya in
the fifth, anna*ñ* *k*a in the seventh Sûtra. In this case we should
have to translate: 5. After this, having (respectfully) spoken to them
who have been adorned (by him with flowers, ornaments, &c.); 6. And
having put (food) into the fire, 7. And having assigned the food to
them, &c., he shall cause them to eat.—The respectful address mentioned
in the fifth Sûtra consists, according to Nârâya*n*a, in the
announcement, 'Ye Brâhma*n*as, I will put (food) into the fire!' (comp.
Â*s*v.-G*ri*hya IV, 7, 18), which he subsequently does with the
formulas, 'To Agni Kavyavâhana svâhâ! To Soma Pit*ri*mat svâhâ! To Yama
Aṅgirasvat Pit*ri*mat svâhâ!' Comp. Baudhâyana II, 1 4, 8.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[108:9](sbe29063.htm#fr_234.md) As to the way in
which the Pi*nd*as should he offered, Nârâya*n*a refers to the
*S*rauta-sûtra (IV, 4).

<span id="fn_234"></span>[108:10-11](sbe29063.htm#fr_235.md) 10, 11.
Pi*nd*ân evidently belongs to the tenth Sûtra, not, as the Indian
tradition takes it, to the eleventh. Between the Pi*nd*as of the fathers
and those belonging to the mothers he puts, according to Nârâya*n*a, for
instance, Darbha grass.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[108:13](sbe29063.htm#fr_236.md) *S*rauta-sûtra
IV, 3 seq.
