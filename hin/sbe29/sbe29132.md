Araṅgara sounds, three times bound with the strap. It praises the
welfare; may it drive away ill.'

5\. He then should pour water into it with (the verse), 'Hither may king
Varu*n*a come with the plentiful (waters); at this place may he stay
contented; bringing welfare, dropping ghee may they lie down together
with Mitra.'

following way).

7 <span id="fr_519"></span>[7](#fn_518). He puts gold into water into

cause them to say, 'Lucky is the ground! Lucky is the ground!'
