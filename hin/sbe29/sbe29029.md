Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 27.

1\. In the sixth month the Annaprâ*s*ana (i.e. the first feeding with
solid food).

2 <span id="fr_114"></span>[2-6](#fn_113.md). Goat's flesh, if he is
desirous of nourishment,

3 <span id="fr_115"></span>[3](#fn_114.md). Flesh of partridge, if desirous
of holy lustre,

4\. Fish, if desirous of swiftness,

5\. Boiled rice with ghee, if desirous of splendour—

6\. (Such) food, prepared with milk curds, honey, and ghee, he should
give (to the child) to eat.

7 <span id="fr_116"></span>[7](#fn_115.md). After he has made oblations
with (the verses), 'Lord of food, give us food, painless and strong;
bring forward the giver; bestow power on us, on men and animals;'
'Whatsoever' (Rig-veda IV, 12, 4); 'Even of great' (ibid. 5), 'Him,
Agni, (lead) to long life and splendour; sharp strength (mayst thou),
Varu*n*a, king Soma, protection may Aditi, like a

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

mother, afford to him, and all the gods that he may reach old age'—

8\. And has recited over (the child) the verse, 'Powers of life, Agni'
(Rig-veda IX, 66, 19),

9\. And has set him down on northward pointed Ku*s*a grass with (the
verse), 'Be soft, O earth' (Rig-veda I, 22, 15)—

10\. The act of feeding is performed with the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis.

11\. Let the mother eat the remnant.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_113"></span>[54:2-6](sbe29029.htm#fr_114.md) 27, 2-6. These
rules stand here, in the beginning of the chapter, as introductory
remarks; the act of feeding itself (Sûtra 10) does not follow till after
the sacrifice and the other performances prescribed in Sûtras 7-9.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[54:3](sbe29029.htm#fr_115.md) This rule evidently
rests on the allusion of taittira (partridge flesh) to the Taittirîya
school.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[54:7](sbe29029.htm#fr_116.md) Both metre and
construction show that the Pâda imam Agna âyushe var*k*ase is
incomplete; the *S*âmbavya-G*ri*hya and Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ II, 3, 10, 3
add k*ri*dhi after var*k*ase.
