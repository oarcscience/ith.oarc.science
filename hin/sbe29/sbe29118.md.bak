### KA*ND*IKÂ 19.

1\. In the eighth year let him initiate a Brâhma*n*a,

2\. Or in the eighth year after the conception;

3\. In the eleventh a Kshatriya;

4\. In the twelfth a Vai*s*ya.

5\. Until the sixteenth (year) the time has not passed for a Brâhma*n*a;

6\. Until the twenty-second for a Kshatriya;

7\. Until the twenty-fourth for a Vai*s*ya.

8\. After that (time has passed), they become patitasâvitrîka (i.e. they
have lost their right of learning the Sâvitrî).

9\. No one should initiate such men, nor teach them, nor perform
sacrifices for them, nor have intercourse with them.

10 <span id="fr_455"></span>[10](#fn_454). (Let him initiate.md) the youth
who is adorned and whose (hair on the) head is arranged, who wears a
(new) garment that has not yet been washed, or an antelope-skin, if he
is a Brâhma*n*a, the skin of a spotted deer, if a Kshatriya, a goat's
skin, if a Vai*s*ya.

11\. If they put on garments, they should put on dyed (garments): the
Brâhma*n*a a reddish yellow one, the Kshatriya a light red one, the
Vai*s*ya a yellow one.

12\. Their girdles are: that of a Brâhma*n*a made of Mu*ñg*a grass, that
of a Kshatriya a bow-string, that of a Vai*s*ya woollen.

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

13\. Their staffs are: that of a Brâhma*n*a of Palâ*s*a wood, that of a
Kshatriya of Udumbara wood, that of a Vai*s*ya of Bilva wood.
