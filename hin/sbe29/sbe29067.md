*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 5.

1 <span id="fr_252"></span>[1](#fn_251). Now (follows.md) the Upâkara*n*a
(i.e. the ceremony by which the annual course of study is opened).

2 <span id="fr_253"></span>[2](#fn_252.md). When the herbs appear, under
the Nakshatra Hasta or *S*rava*n*a,

3\. Let him make oblations of the flour of fried barley and of grains,
mixed with curds and ghee, with the (whole) Veda, verse by verse: thus
say some (teachers).

4 <span id="fr_254"></span>[4](#fn_253.md). Or with the first verses of the
Sûktas and Anuvâkas.

5\. With the first verses of the Adhyâyas and of the sections belonging
to the (different) *Ri*shis, according to Mâ*nd*ûkeya.

6\. But Kaushîtaki has said:

7\. 'I praise Agni the Purohita' (Rig-veda I, 1, 1), this one verse,

8\. 'The Kushumbhaka (mungoose?) has said it;' 'If thou criest, O bird,
announce luck to us;' 'Sung by *G*amadagni;' 'In thy abode the whole
world rests;'

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Come to our
sacrifice, O you that are worthy of sacrifice, with care;' 'Whosoever,
be he ours, be he alien;' 'Look on, look about;' 'Come here, Agni, the
Maruts’ friend;' 'The oblation, O king, cooked for thee:' each time two
verses,

9 <span id="fr_255"></span>[9](#fn_254.md). 'That blessing and bliss we
choose'—this one verse (the first and last verse of each Ma*nd*ala).

10\. (Taking something) of the remnants of the sacrificed (food) they
partake of that sacrificial food with this (verse), 'I praised
Dadhikrâvan' (Rig-veda IV, 39, 6).

11\. They sip water, sit down,

12\. Murmur the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis, the Sâvitrî, and the auspicious hymns
commencing from the beginning of the Veda,

13\. And cause the teacher to pronounce auspicious wishes.

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

14\. Of this (ceremony) it is also said,

15\. 'Desirous (of acquiring) for the hymns inexhaustible vigour,
reverence, and also soundness, the *Ri*shis, by the power of their
austerities, have discovered the Upâkarman.

16 <span id="fr_256"></span>[16](#fn_255.md). 'Therefore a constant
performer of the six kinds of works should, in order that his Mantras
might be successful, perform the Upâkarman—so they say—if he wishes for
success of his (holy) works.

17 <span id="fr_257"></span>[17](#fn_256.md). 'At the time of the Upâkarman
and of the Utsarga an interruption (of the Veda-study) shall take place
for (three days and) three nights, likewise at the Ash*t*akâs for one
day and one night, and so on the last night of each season.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_251"></span>[112:1](sbe29067.htm#fr_252.md) 5, 1. As to the
Upâkara*n*a, see the statements of Professor Weber in his second article
on the Nakshatras, Abhandlungen der Berliner Akademie, 1861, p. 338, and
of Professor Bühler in his notes on Âpastamba, S.B.E., II, pp. 110, 111.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[112:2](sbe29067.htm#fr_253.md) The Nakshatra
*S*rava*n*a is evidently considered as particularly fit for this
occasion because of its name containing an allusion to *s*ruti, &c.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[112:4](sbe29067.htm#fr_254.md) I have followed
Nârâya*n*a, but perhaps I ought to have translated, 'Sûktas or
Anuvâkas,' and in the fifth Sûtra, 'Adhyâyas or the sections, &c.'

<span id="fn_254"></span>[113:9](sbe29067.htm#fr_255.md) According to
Kaushîtaki, the oblations are made with the first and last *rik*as of
each Ma*nd*ala. The last *rik* of the tenth Ma*nd*ala quoted here, ta*k*
*kh*a*m* yor â v*rin*îmahe, is different from the verse with which our
Sa*m*hitâ (the *S*âkala Sa*m*hitâ of the Rig-veda) closes. It is well
known that ta*k* *kh*a*m* yor â v*rin*îmahe is the last verse in the
Bâshkala *S*âkhâ which was adopted by the *S*âṅkhâyana school (comp.
Indische Studien, IV, 431; Weber, Verzeichniss der Berliner
Sanskrit-Handschriften, p. 314, &c.; Indische Literaturgeschichte,
second edition, Nachtrag, p. 2). It was also known long since that the
Bâshkala Sâkhâ of the Rig-veda contains eight hymns more than the
*S*âkala *S*âkhâ. The *K*ara*n*avyûha Bhâshya (comp. Dr. von Schroeder's
Introduction to his excellent edition of the Maitrâya*n*î Sa*m*hitâ,
vol. i, p. xxiv), known to me through the kindness of Professor Weber,
tells which eight hymns these are. There it is said (folio 22 of
Professor Weber's MS.) that in the Bâshkala Sa*m*hitâ there followed
after VIII, 48 the first two of the Vâlakhilya hymns, after VIII, 94 the
Vâlakhilya hymns 3-7, and at the end of the whole collection the
so-called sa*mgñ*âna hymn (see Professor Max Müller's edition, vol. vi,
p. 32), which ends with the very verse quoted in our Sûtra, ta*k*
*kh*a*m* yor â v*rin*îmahe.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[114:16](sbe29067.htm#fr_256.md) The six kinds of
works are, performing sacrifices (ya*g*ana), officiating at the
sacrifices of others (yâ*g*ana), studying the Veda (adhyayana), teaching
the Veda to others (adhyâpana), giving (dâna), and accepting gifts
(pratigraha). Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[114:17](sbe29067.htm#fr_257.md) Concerning the
Utsarga, see chap. 6. This *S*loka occurs also Manu IV, 119 with the
reading kshepa*n*am instead of kshapa*n*am ('kshapa*n*a*m* *kh*andasâ*m*
virâma anadhyâya*h*,' Nârâya*n*a). Kshapa*n*am is correct.
