### KA*ND*IKÂ 10.

1 <span id="fr_559"></span>[1](#fn_558). If (a student.md) wishes to be
dismissed (by his teacher), he should pronounce before the teacher his
(i.e. the teacher's?) name—

2 <span id="fr_560"></span>[2](#fn_559). (And should say.md), 'Here we will
dwell, sir!'

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

3\. With a loud voice (the words) following after the name.

4\. 'Of inhalation and exhalation'—(this he says) with a low voice,

5\. And (the verse), 'Come hither, Indra, with thy lovely-sounding,
fallow-coloured (horses)' (Rig-veda III, 45, 1).

6 <span id="fr_561"></span>[6](#fn_560.md). The aged one then murmurs, 'To
inhalation and exhalation I, the wide-extended one, resort with thee. To
the god Savit*ri* I give thee in charge'—and the verse.

7\. When he has finished (that verse), and has muttered, 'Om! Forwards!
Blessing!' and recited (over the student the hymn), 'The great bliss of
the three' (Rig-veda X, 185)—(he should dismiss him).

8\. On one who has been thus dismissed, danger comes from no side—thus
it is understood (in the *S*ruti).

9\. If he hears (on his way) disagreeable voices of birds, he should
murmur the two hymns, 'Shrieking, manifesting his being' (Rig-veda II,
42, 43), and (the verse), 'The divine voice have the gods created'
(Rig-veda VIII, 100, 11).

10\. 'Praise the renowned youth who sits on the war-chariot' (Rig-veda
II, 33, 11)—if (he hears disagreeable voices) of deer.

11\. From the direction, or from the (being) from which he expects
danger, towards that direction he should throw a fire-brand, burning on
both sides, or having twirled about a churning-stick from the right to
the left, with (the words), 'Safety be to me, Mitra

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

and Varu*n*a; encounter the foes and burn them up with your flame. May
they find none who knows them and no support; divided by discord may
they go to death'—

12\. He turns the churning-stick downwards with (the verse), 'The
combined wealth of both, heaped together' (Rig-veda X, 84, 7).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_558"></span>[230:1](sbe29143.htm#fr_559.md) 10, 1. Nârâya*n*a
refers this rule to a student who has performed the Samâvartana and
wishes to go away. But a comparison of *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya II, 18
seems to make it probable that the ceremony described here has nothing
to do with the Samâvartana.

I take this chapter rather for a description of the way in which a
student has to take leave of his teacher when setting out on a journey.
'His name' is the teacher's name, according to Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[230:2](sbe29143.htm#fr_560.md) *S*âṅkhâyana II,
18, 1. Sâṅkh. has aha*m* vatsyâmi; Â*s*valâyana, ida*m* vatsyârna*h*.
The commentator says that instead of ida*m* the Â*s*rama is to be named
which the student chooses to enter upon, for instance, Devadatta, we
will dwell in the state of a householder, sir!'

<span id="fn_560"></span>[231:6](sbe29143.htm#fr_561.md) I have translated,
as Prof. Stenzler has also done, according to *S*âṅkhâyana's reading,
prâ*n*âpânâ . . . tvayâ. The 'aged one' is the teacher, the verse that
which is quoted in Sûtra 5.
