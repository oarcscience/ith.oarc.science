### KA*ND*IKÂ 11.

1 <span id="fr_937"></span>[1](#fn_936.md). If an animal (is to be
sacrificed), let him wash it, if it is not a cow; let him walk round the
fires and drive in front (of them) a Palâ*s*a branch into the ground.

2 <span id="fr_938"></span>[2](#fn_937). The winding (of a Ku*s*a rope.md)
round (that branch), the touching (of the animal with the grass-blade),
the binding (of it to the branch), and the sprinkling (of the animal
with water) should be performed in the way prescribed (in the
*S*rauta-sûtra), and whatever else (is to be done).

3 <span id="fr_939"></span>[3](#fn_938.md). After he has sacrificed the two
oblations before and after the killing of the animal, (he) silently
(sacrifices) five other (oblations, directed to Pra*g*âpati).

4 <span id="fr_940"></span>[4](#fn_939.md). And the omentum is taken out
(of the killed animal). He should besprinkle it (with water) and name
the deity (to whom the sacrifice is directed).

5 <span id="fr_941"></span>[5](#fn_940.md). (He should name that deity
also) at the touching (of the animal with the grass-blade), at (its)
being bound (to the branch), at its being sprinkled (with water), and at
(the preparation and oblation) of the mess of cooked food.

6\. After he has sacrificed the omentum, he cuts off the Avadâna
portions,

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

7 <span id="fr_942"></span>[7](#fn_941.md). All of them, or three, or five.

8 <span id="fr_943"></span>[8](#fn_942.md). He sacrifices the Avadâna
portions together with the mess of cooked food.

9\. A limb of the animal is the sacrificial fee.

10 <span id="fr_944"></span>[10-11](#fn_943). At (a sacrifice.md) directed
to a special deity he should sacrifice (an animal) belonging to that
deity, should make a portion for that (god), and should say to him (i.e.
to the messenger who is to convey that offering to a place sacred to
that deity): 'Take care that this may reach that (god).'

11\. If there is a river between (the sacrificer and that sacred place),
he may have a boat made, or he may dispense with this.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_936"></span>[360:1](sbe29201.htm#fr_937.md) 11, 1. The branch
replaces the sacrificial post (yûpa) of the *S*rauta ritual. As to
agre*n*a, comp. Kâty.-*S*raut. VI, 2, 11 and the commentary.

<span id="fn_937"></span>[360:2](sbe29201.htm#fr_938.md) See Kâty.-*S*raut.
VI, 3, 15 on the parivyaya*n*a, ibid. §§ 19, 26 on the upâkara*n*a, § 27
on the niyo*g*ana, § 33 on the proksha*n*a.

<span id="fn_938"></span>[360:3](sbe29201.htm#fr_939.md) Kâtyâyana VI, 5,
22: He sacrifices (Â*g*ya) with the words, Svâhâ to the gods.' § 24: He
sacrifices (Â*g*ya) with the words, To the gods svâhâ.' In the
commentary on § 25 these two oblations are called paripa*s*avyâhutî.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[360:4](sbe29201.htm#fr_940.md) See Kâtyâyana VI,
6, 13; Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I, 11, 10.

<span id="fn_940"></span>[360:5](sbe29201.htm#fr_941.md) See above, Sûtra
2.

<span id="fn_941"></span>[361:7](sbe29201.htm#fr_942.md) The complete
number of the Avadânas (i.e. the portions of the killed animal which
have to be cut off, such as the heart, the tongue, &c.) is eleven; see
Kâty.-*S*raut. VI, 7, 6; Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I, II, 12.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[361:8](sbe29201.htm#fr_943.md)
Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya, loc. cit. § 13.

<span id="fn_943"></span>[361:10-11](sbe29201.htm#fr_944.md) 10, 11. The
way for interpreting these Sûtras is shown by Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I,
12. I do not think that they have anything to do, as *G*ayarâma states,
with reference to Sûtra II, with the offering due to a relative who has
died while being absent on a journey (chap. 10, 44).
