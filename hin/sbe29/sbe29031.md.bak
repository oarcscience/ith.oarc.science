### ADHYÂYA II, KHA*ND*A 1.

1 <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_119.md). In the eighth year after the
conception let him initiate a Brâhma*n*a,

2\. With an antelope-skin,

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

3\. Or in the tenth year after the conception.

4\. In the eleventh year after the conception a Kshatriya with the skin
of a spotted deer,

5\. In the twelfth year after the conception a Vai*s*ya with a cow-hide.

6\. Until the sixteenth year the time has not passed for a Brâhma*n*a,

7\. Until the twenty-second for a Kshatriya,

8\. Until the twenty-fourth for a Vai*s*ya.

9 <span id="fr_121"></span>[9](#fn_120). After that (time has passed.md),
they become patitasâvitrîka (men who have lost their right of learning
the Sâvitrî).

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

10\. Let them not initiate such men,

11\. Nor teach them,

12\. Nor perform sacrifices for them,

13\. Nor have intercourse with them.

14 <span id="fr_122"></span>[14](#fn_121.md). Or (let them initiate
students of) all (castes) wearing a (new) garment that has not yet been
washed.

And wearing a girdle.

15\. The girdle of a Brâhma*n*a (shall be) made of Mu*ñg*a grass,

16\. That of a Kshatriya (shall be) a bowstring,

17\. That of a Vai*s*ya a woollen thread.

18\. The staff of a Brâhma*n*a (shall be) made of Palâ*s*a or of Bilva
wood,

19\. That of a Kshatriya of Nyagrodha wood,

20\. That of a Vai*s*ya of Udumbara wood.

21 <span id="fr_123"></span>[21](#fn_122.md). That of the Brâhma*n*a shall
reach the tip of the nose,

22\. That of the Kshatriya the forehead,

23\. That of the Vai*s*ya the hair.

24\. Or all (sorts of staffs are to be used) by (men of) all (castes).

25\. Whatsoever (the student) wears at his initiation, is at the
disposal of the teacher.

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

26 <span id="fr_124"></span>[26](#fn_123.md). Having had him shaved all
round (his head) he should initiate him.

27\. After (the student) has washed and adorned himself,

28 <span id="fr_125"></span>[28](#fn_124). (And) after (the teacher.md) has
sacrificed, both station themselves behind the fire, the teacher with
his face turned to the east, the other with his face to the west.

29\. Let him initiate him standing while (the other also) stands.

30 <span id="fr_126"></span>[30](#fn_125.md). \['The firm, powerful eye of
Mitra, glorious splendour, strong and prosperous, a chaste, flowing
vesture, this skin I put on, a valiant (man).'\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_119"></span>[58:1](sbe29031.htm#fr_120.md) 1, 1. With regard
to the standing terminology of the Upanayana, or the initiation of the
student, we may observe that upa-nî does not mean, as, for instance,
Professor Stenzler seems to understand it, 'to introduce a student to
his teacher.' Thus Pâraskara's Sûtra II, 2, 1, ash*t*âvarsha*m*
brâhma*n*am upanayet, &c., is translated by that distinguished scholar,
'Den achtjährigen Brâhma*n*a soll er (beim Lehrer) einführen,' &c.
(comp. also Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I, 19, 1). The texts clearly point to
another translation of upa-nî, for they show that the person that
introduces the student (upanayati or upanayate; the middle is used very
frequently, for instance, *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a XI, 5, 4, 1; *S*âṅkh.
II, I, 25) is not the father or a relation of the youth who could be
supposed to lead him to the teacher, but the teacher himself; he
introduces (upanayati) him to the brahma*k*arya, or introduces him with
himself, and the student enters upon (upaiti) the brahma*k*arya, or
enters with (upaiti) the teacher; he who has thus entered upon
studentship, is consequently designated as upeta (*S*âṅkh. IV, 8, 1;
Pâraskara III, 10, 10), and for the initiation, which is usually called
up an ay an a, occasionally also the word upâyana is used (see the
Mânava-G*ri*hya I, 22, quoted by Professor Jolly in his article, Das
Dharma-sûtra des Vish*n*u, p. 79). The following passages may be quoted
here as supporting our opinion on this terminology. At *S*atapatha
Brâhma*n*a XI, 5, 3, 13 *S*au*k*eya says to Uddâlaka Âru*n*i, 'I will
enter (as a student) with the reverend One' (upâyâni bhagavantam); and
Âru*n*i replies, 'Come, enter (with me)!' (ehy upehi), 'and he initiated
him' (ta*m* hopaninye). Ibid. XI, 5, 4, 16 it is stated that according
to some a teacher who has initiated a Brâhma*n*a as a student
(brâhma*n*a*m* brahma*k*aryam upanîya) should abstain from sexual
intercourse, for a student who enters upon studentship (yo
brahma*k*aryam upaiti) becomes, as it were, a garbha, &c. Finally we may
add that the Buddhist terminology regarding the entering into the order
or upon a life of righteousness is clearly connected with that followed,
for instance, in the dialogue between <span id="page_59">p. 59</span>
*S*au*k*eya and Âru*n*i. As *S*au*k*eya there says, upâyâni bhagavantam,
we frequently read in the Pâli books expressions like this, upemi
Buddha*m* sara*n*a*m* dhamma*ñ* *k*âpi anuttara*m*, &c. (Dhammap.
A*tth*akathâ, p. 97, ed. Fausböll), and as Âru*n*i replies, ehy upehi,
Buddha says to those who wish to be ordained, ehi bhikkhu, svâkkhâto
dhammo, *k*ara brahma*k*ariya*m*, &c. (Mahâvagga I, 6, 32, &c.; S.B.E.,
vol. xiii, p. 74, note).

The counting of the years not from the birth but from the conception
occurs both in the Brahmanical and in the Buddhist ordinances, comp. H.
O., Buddha, sein Leben, seine Lehre, seine Gemeinde, p. 354, note 1.
Several G*ri*hya texts (for instance, Â*s*v. I, 19, 1. 2) admit both
ways of counting the years. The number of years given for the Upanayana
of persons of the three castes (Brâhma*n*as 8-16, Kshatriyas 11-22,
Vai*s*yas 12-24) is evidently derived from the number of syllables of
the three metres which are so very frequently stated to correspond to
the three castes, to the three gods or categories of gods (Agni, Indra,
Vi*s*ve devâs) &c., viz. the Gâyatrî, the Trish*t*ubh, and the *G*agatî.
This is a very curious example, showing how in India phantastical
speculations like those regarding the mystical qualities of the metres,
were strong enough to influence the customs and institutions of real
life.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[59:9](sbe29031.htm#fr_121.md) 9 seq. All these
are standing expressions recurring nearly identically in most of the
G*ri*hya and Dharma-sûtras. In the rule contained in Sûtra 13 a number
of the parallel texts have vivaheyu*h* or vivâhayeyu*h*, others have
vyavahareyu*h*. Comp. Vasish*th*a XI, 75; Indische Studien, vol. x, p.
21.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[60:14](sbe29031.htm#fr_122.md) This Sûtra should
rather be divided into two, as indicated in the translation. As to the
mekhalâ (girdle) comp. below, chap. 2, 1.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[60:21](sbe29031.htm#fr_123.md) There is no doubt
that prâ*n*asammito (which Nârâya*n*a explains thus, 'prâ*n*a is the
wind \[or breath\]; \[the staff should\] reach to the place where the
wind leaves the body, i.e. to the tip of the nose') should either be
corrected into, or explained as, ghrâ*n*asammito; the *S*âmbavya MS. has
ghrâ*n*ântiko brâhma*n*asya. Comp. Gautama I, 26, &c. The parallel texts
agree in assigning the longer staff to the higher, not as *S*âṅkhâyana
does, to the lower caste.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[61:26](sbe29031.htm#fr_124.md) After the
introductory remarks given in the preceding Sûtras the ritual itself of
the Upanayana is now described.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[61:28](sbe29031.htm#fr_125.md) Nârâya*n*a:
hutvâ’nâde*s*aparibhâshâta*h* (see above, I, 12, 13)
purastâtsa*mgñ*aka*m* hutvâ agni*m* sthâpitâgni*m* (see above, I, 5, 2)
*g*aghanena . . . tish*th*ata*h*.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[61:30](sbe29031.htm#fr_126.md) This Sûtra is
wanting in most of the MSS. (see the note, p. 48 of the German edition).
It contains the Mantra with which the A*g*ina (the hide mentioned in
Sûtras 2, 4, 5 of this chapter) is put on. Nârâya*n*a gives the Mantra
which he says is taken from the Mâdhyandina-G*ri*hya (in the
Pâraskara-G*ri*hya it is not found), after chap. 2, 3, and he states
that the corresponding act to which it belongs has its place after the
rites concerning the girdle (chap. 2, 1) and the sacrificial cord (2,
3).
