have to make a journey (to their new home), let him cause her to mount
the chariot with the (verse), 'May Pûshan lead thee from here holding
thy hand' (Rig-veda X, 85, 26).

2 <span id="fr_400"></span>[2](#fn_399.md). With the hemistich, 'Carrying
stones (the river) streams; hold fast each other' (Rig-veda X, 53, 8)

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

6 <span id="fr_402"></span>[6](#fn_401.md). At lovely places, trees, and
