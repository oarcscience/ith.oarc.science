### KA*ND*IKÂ 10.

1\. Now the water libations (which are performed for deceased persons).

2 <span id="fr_917"></span>[2](#fn_916). When (a child.md) that has not
reached the age of two years dies, his father and mother become impure.

3\. The other (relations) remain pure.

4\. (The impurity lasts) through one night or three nights.

5\. They bury the body without burning it.

6\. If (a child dies) during the impurity of his mother (caused by the
child's birth), the impurity lasts till the (mother's) getting up (from
child-bed), in the same way as the impurity caused by a child's birth.

7 <span id="fr_918"></span>[7](#fn_917.md). In this case (of the child
being younger than two years) no water libations (are performed).

8\. If a child of more than two years dies, all his relations should
follow (the corpse) to the cemetery—

9 <span id="fr_919"></span>[10\_9](#fn_918.md). Singing the Yama song and
murmuring the Yama hymn, according to some (teachers).

10 <span id="fr_920"></span>[10\_10](#fn_919). If (the dead person.md) has
received the initiation,

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the rites) from
the election of the site (for the *S*ma*s*âna) down to their descending
into water (in order to bathe themselves) are the same as those
prescribed for persons who have set up the (sacred *S*rauta) fires.

11\. They burn him with his (sacred) domestic fire, if he has kept that;

12\. Silently, with a common fire, other persons.

13\. They should ask one who is related (to the deceased person) by
blood or by marriage, for (his permission to perform) the
water-libation, in the words, 'We shall perform the libation.'

14\. (He replies), 'Do so now and never again,' if the deceased person
was not a hundred years old.

15\. (He says) only, 'Do so,' if he was.

16 <span id="fr_921"></span>[16](#fn_920.md). All relations (of the
deceased), to the seventh or to the tenth degree, descend into water.

17\. If dwelling in the same village, (all) as far as they can trace
their relationship.

18\. They wear (only) one garment, and have the sacred cord suspended
over the right shoulder.

19\. With the fourth finger of the left hand they spirt away (the water)
with (the words), 'May he drive evil away from us with his splendour'
(Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXXV, 6).

20\. Facing the south, they plunge (into the water).

21\. They pour out with joined hands one libation of water to the
deceased person with (the words), 'N.N.! This water to thee!'

22\. When they have come out (of the water) and

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

have sat down on a pure spot that is covered with grass, (those who are
versed in ancient tales) should entertain them (by telling such tales).

23 <span id="fr_922"></span>[23](#fn_921.md). They return to the village
without looking back, in one row, the youngest walking in front.

24 <span id="fr_923"></span>[24](#fn_922.md). In the doors of their houses
they chew leaves of the Pi*k*umanda (or Nimba) tree, sip water, touch
water, fire, cowdung, white mustard seeds, and oil, tread upon a stone,
and then they enter.

25 <span id="fr_924"></span>[25-26](#fn_923.md). Through a period of three
nights they should remain chaste, sleep on the ground, do no work and
charge nobody (to do it for them).

26\. Let them eat food which they have bought or received (from.
others); (they should eat it) only in the day-time, (and should eat) no
meat.

27 <span id="fr_925"></span>[27](#fn_924.md). Having offered to the
deceased person the Pi*nd*a, naming his name at the washing, at the
offering (of the Pi*nd*a), and at the second washing—

28 <span id="fr_926"></span>[28](#fn_925.md). They should that night put
milk and water in an earthen vessel into the open air with (the words),
'Deceased one, bathe here!'

29 <span id="fr_927"></span>[29-30](#fn_926.md). The impurity caused by
death lasts through three nights;

30\. Through ten nights, according to some (teachers).

31\. (During that period they) should not perform Svâdhyâya (or study
the Vedic texts for themselves).

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

32\. They should intermit the standing rites, except those performed
with the three (*S*rauta) fires,

33\. And (with the exception of those performed) with the (sacred)
domestic fire, according to some (teachers).

34\. Others should perform (those rites for them).

35\. Those who have touched the dead body should not enter the village
until the stars appear.

36\. If (they have touched it) in the night-time, (they should not
enter) till sunrise.

37 <span id="fr_928"></span>[37](#fn_927.md). The entering and what follows
after it is the same (for these persons) as for the others.

38\. (Their) impurity lasts through one or two fortnights.

39\. The same (rites should be performed) when the teacher (has died),

40\. Or the maternal grandfather or grandmother,

41\. Or unmarried females.

42 <span id="fr_929"></span>[42](#fn_928.md). For those who were married,
the others should do it,

43 <span id="fr_930"></span>[43](#fn_929). And they for the (others.md).

44 <span id="fr_931"></span>[44](#fn_930.md). If one dies while being
absent on a journey, (his relations) shall sit (on the ground, as
prescribed for impure persons) from the time when they have heard (of
his death), performing the water libation

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (at that time),
until the period (of their impurity) has expired;

45\. If (that period has already) elapsed, through one night or three
nights.

46\. Optional is the water libation for an officiating priest, a
father-in-law, a friend, for (distant) relations, for a maternal uncle,
and for a sister's son;

47 <span id="fr_932"></span>[47](#fn_931.md). And for married females.

48\. On the eleventh day he should give to an uneven number of
Brâhma*n*as a meal at which meat is served.

49\. Some also kill a cow in honour of the deceased person.

50\. When the Pi*nd*as are prepared, the deceased person, if he has
sons, shall be considered as the first of the (three) Fathers (to whom
Pi*nd*as are offered).

51 <span id="fr_933"></span>[51](#fn_932.md). The fourth one should be left
out.

52 <span id="fr_934"></span>[52](#fn_933.md). Some (make Pi*nd*a offerings
to a deceased person) separately through one year (before admitting him
to a share in the common Pit*ri*ya*gñ*a).

53 <span id="fr_935"></span>[53](#fn_934.md). But there is a rule, 'There
can be no fourth Pi*nd*a'—for this is stated in the *S*ruti.

54 <span id="fr_936"></span>[54](#fn_935.md). Every day he shall give food
to him (i.e. to the deceased person), and if he was a Brâhma*n*a, a
vessel with water.

55\. Some offer also a. Pi*nd*a.

<span id="fn_927"></span>[358:37](sbe29200.htm#fr_928.md) The position of
this Sûtra after 35, 36 seems to me to indicate that it refers to those
who have touched the dead body; comp. Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 14:
prave*s*anâdika*m* karma pretasa*m*spar*s*inâm api. I believe that the
same persons are concerned also in Sûtra 38.

<span id="fn_928"></span>[358:42](sbe29200.htm#fr_929.md) I.e. the husband
and his relatives. Comp. Vasish*th*a IV, 19.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[358:43](sbe29200.htm#fr_930.md) A married female
should perform the rites for her husband and his relatives. See

Sapi*nd*îkara*n*a, ibid., chap. 3.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[359:53](sbe29200.htm#fr_935.md) There would be
four Pi*nd*as, if one were to be offered to the recently deceased
person, and three others to those Fathers who had received Pi*nd*a
offerings before his death. Therefore one of these three Fathers is
omitted; see § 51.
