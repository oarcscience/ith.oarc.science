### KHA*ND*A 2.

1\. 'Here has come to us, protecting (us) from evil words, purifying our
kin as a purifier, clothing herself, by (the power of) inhalation and
exhalation, with strength, this friendly goddess, this blessed
girdle'—with these words, three times repeated, he ties the girdle from
left to right thrice round.

2 <span id="fr_127"></span>[2](#fn_126). (There should be.md) one knot, or
also three, or also five.

3 <span id="fr_128"></span>[3](#fn_127.md). He adjusts the sacrificial cord
with (the words), 'The sacrificial cord art thou. With the cord of the
sacrifice I invest thee.'

4 <span id="fr_129"></span>[4](#fn_128.md). He fills the two hollows of
(his own and the student's) joined hands (with water), and then says to
him: 'What is thy name?'

5\. 'I am N.N., sir,' says the other.

6 <span id="fr_130"></span>[6-7](#fn_129.md). 'Descending from the same
*Ri*shis?' says the teacher.

7\. 'Descending from the same *Ri*shis, sir,' says the other.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

8\. 'Declare (that thou art) a student, sir.'

9\. 'I am a student, sir,' says the other.

10\. With the words, 'Bhûr bhuva*h* sva*h*' (the teacher) sprinkles
thrice with his joined hands (water) on the joined hands (of the
student),

11 <span id="fr_131"></span>[11](#fn_130). And seizing (the student's.md)
hands with (his own) hands, holding the right uppermost, he murmurs,

12\. 'By the impulse of the god Savitar, with the arms of the two
A*s*vins, with Pûshan's hands I initiate thee, N.N.'

13\. Those who are desirous of a host (of adherents, he should initiate)
with (the verse), 'Thee, (the lord) of hosts' (Rig-veda II, 23, 1).

14\. Warriors with (the verse), 'Come here, do not come to harm'
(Rig-veda VIII, 20, 1).

15\. Sick persons with the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[62:2](sbe29032.htm#fr_127.md) 2, 2. Râma*k*andra:
'Let him make one, or three, or five knots, according to (the student's)
Ârsheya,' i.e. accordingly as he belongs to a family that invokes, in
the Pravara ceremony, one, or three, or five *Ri*shis as their
ancestors. Comp. Weber, Indische Studien, vol. x, p. 79.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[62:3](sbe29032.htm#fr_128.md) On the sacrificial
cord (upavita) comp. the G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha-pari*s*ish*t*a II, 48 seq.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[62:4](sbe29032.htm#fr_129.md) Nârâya*n*a:

<span id="fn_129"></span>[62:6-7](sbe29032.htm#fr_130.md) 6, 7. A similar
dialogue between the teacher and the student at the Upanayana is given
in the Kau*s*ika-sûtra (ap. Weber, Indische Studien, X, 71). The student
there says, 'Make me an Ârsheya (a descendant of the *Ri*shis) and one
who has relations, and initiate me.' And the teacher replies, 'I make
thee an Ârsheya and one who has relations, and I initiate thee.' As in
this passage of the Kau*s*ika-sûtra the teacher is represented as having
the power of making, by the Upanayana ceremony, an Ârsheya of the
student, thus, according to the view expressed by Professor Weber (loc.
cit., p. 72 seq.), *S*âṅkhâyana would even give it into the teacher's
power to make the student his samânârsheya, i.e. to extend his own
Ârsheya on as many pupils as he likes. Professor Weber understands the
sixth Sûtra so that the teacher would have to say, samânârsheyo bhavân
brûhi (Nârâya*n*a: bhavân brûhîti brahma*k*ârî bhavân brûhîty ata*h*
\[Sûtra 8\] si*m*hâvalokananyâyenâtrânusha*g*yate. According to
Râma*k*andra's Paddhati he is <span id="page_63">p. 63</span> only to
say samânârsheya*h*). The student answers, samânârsheyo ’ham bho;
Professor Weber, who supplies the imperative asâni, translates this,
'May I have the same Ârsheya, sir!'

I think it more natural to simply translate the teacher's question, 'Art
thou samânârsheya?' (or, supplying bhavân brûhi from Sûtra 8, 'Declare
that thou art samânârsheya'), and the student's reply, I am
samânârsheya, sir!' Thus we ought possibly to consider these formulas,
which state a fictitious, ideal samânârsheyatva of the teacher and the
students as a trace, and as far as I can see as the only trace, of an
ancient rule requiring a real samânârsheyatva of teacher and student. As
long as the ritual differences between the different Gotras, of which,
as is well known, only a few traces have survived in the Vedic
tradition, had retained their full importance, it can indeed scarcely
have been considered as admissible that a young Brâhma*n*a should be
confided to the guidance of a teacher who sacrificed and invoked the
gods in another way than the customs of the pupil's own family required.
