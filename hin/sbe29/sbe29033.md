### KHA*ND*A 3.

1 <span id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_131). 'Bhaga has seized thy hand,
Savitar has seized thy hand, Pûshan has seized thy hand, Aryaman has
seized thy hand. Mitra art thou by right, Agni is thy teacher, and I,
N.N., both of us. Agni, I give this student in charge to thee. Indra, I
give this student in charge to thee. Sun, I give this student in charge
to thee. Vi*s*ve devâs, I give this student in charge to you, for the
sake of long life, of blessed offspring and strength, of increase of
wealth, of mastership of all Vedas, of renown, of bliss.'

the sun's course I move after him'—with these words he turns round from
left to right,

3\. And grasping down with the span of his right hand over (the
student's) right shoulder he touches the place of his heart with the
words, 'May I be dear to thy inviolate heart.'

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

4\. Having silently turned round from right to left,

the fingers upwards on his (i.e. the student's) heart, he murmurs:

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_131"></span>[64:1](sbe29033.htm#fr_132) 3. 1. T.
Nârâya*n*a: 'Instead of asau (N.N.) he puts the name of the student in
the vocative case.' I think rather that the teacher here pronounced his
own name. Comp. asâv aha*m* bho, chap. 2, 5, &c., and the Mantra in
Pâraskara II, 2, 20.

The text of the Mantra shows that the Â*k*ârya here seizes the hand of
the Brahma*k*ârin; comp. Â*s*valâyana I, 20, 4-6, where it is stated
that he seizes the student's hand together with the thumb, quite in the
way prescribed for the wedding at *S*âṅkh. I, 13, 2. Comp. also
Pâraskara II, 2, 1 7. Nârâya*n*a: mâ*n*avakasya g*ri*hîtasa*m*pu*t*a
evâ*k*âryo Bhagas ta ima*m* mantra*m* *g*apan, &c.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[64:2](sbe29033.htm#fr_133) Literally, 'he
turns round, following his right arm.' Nârâya*n*a here has the following
note, 'Â*k*âryo ba*t*or dakshi*n*a*m* bâhu*m* hasta*m* aindrîm âv*ri*tam
iti mantre*n*ânvâvartayet. ayam artha*h*, â*k*ârya ima*m* mantra*m*
*g*aptvâ ta*m* ba*t*u*m* *k*a vâ*k*ayitvâ pradakshi*n*âvarta*m*
kârayet.' I believe that the commentator here, as he frequently does,
instead of interpreting the text of *S*âṅkhâyana, fathers <span
id="page_65">p. 65</span> on him statements belonging to other Sûtras,
in this case probably to Â*s*valâyana I, 20, 9. As our text has not
anvâvartya but anvâv*ri*tya; and in the Mantra not âvartasva but âvarte,
we must conclude that he turned round himself, and, as far as the
statements of the text go, did not cause the pupil to do so.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[65:5](sbe29033.htm#fr_134) The gesture is the
same as that prescribed in the Pâraskara-G*ri*hya I, 8, 8 to the
bridegroom at the wedding; the Mantra there is identical with *S*âṅkh.
II, 4, 1, the only difference consisting in the name of the god who is
invoked to unite the two: at the wedding this is Pra*g*âpati, of course,
because he is 'lord of offspring,' at the Upanayana, B*ri*haspati, the
Brahman κατ᾽ εξοχήν among the gods. It is very natural that at the
Upanayana and at the Vivâha, which both are destined to establish an
intimate union between two persons hitherto strangers to each other, a
number of identical rites should occur, for instance, the seizing of the
hand; see the note on Sûtra 1.
