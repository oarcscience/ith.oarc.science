Brahman, to Pra*g*âpati, to the Vi*s*ve devâs, and to Heaven and Earth.

svâhâ!'

'Adoration to the wife! Adoration to the man! To every time of life,
adoration! To the white one with the black teeth, the lord of the bad
women, adoration!

'They who allure my offspring, dwelling in the village or in the forest,
to them be adoration; I offer

a Bali to them. Be welfare to me! May they give me offspring.'
