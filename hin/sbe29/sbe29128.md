*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 5.

1\. On the following day the Anvash*t*akya (i.e. the ceremony following
the Ash*t*akâ, is performed).

2 <span id="fr_503"></span>[2](#fn_502). Having prepared (a portion.md) of
that same meat, having established the fire on a surface inclined
towards the south, having fenced it in, and made a door on the north
side of the enclosure, having strewn round (the fire) three times
sacrificial grass with its roots, without tossing it, turning the left
side towards the fire, he should put down the things to be offered,
boiled rice, boiled rice with sesamum seeds, rice-milk, meal-pap with
curds, and meal-pap with honey.

3 <span id="fr_504"></span>[3](#fn_503.md). (The ceremony should be
performed) according to the ritual of the Pi*nd*apit*ri*ya*gñ*a.

4 <span id="fr_505"></span>[4](#fn_504.md). Having sacrificed (of those
sorts of food) with the exception of the meal-pap with honey, let him
give (lumps of those substances) to the Fathers.

5\. And to (their) wives, with the addition of rum and the scum of
boiled rice.

6\. Some (place the lumps to be offered) into pits, into two or into
six:

7\. In those situated to the east he should give (the offerings) to the
Fathers.

8\. In those to the west, to the wives.

9 <span id="fr_506"></span>[9](#fn_505.md). Thereby the ceremony celebrated
in the rainy season on the Mâgha day, in the dark fortnight after the
full moon of Praush*th*apada (has been declared).

10 <span id="fr_507"></span>[10](#fn_506.md). And thus he should offer (a
celebration like the Anvash*t*akya) to the Fathers every month,
observing uneven numbers (i.e. selecting a day with an uneven number,
inviting an uneven number of Brâhma*n*as, &c.).

11\. He should give food at least to nine (Brâhma*n*as),

12\. Or to an uneven number;

13 <span id="fr_508"></span>[13](#fn_507.md). To an even number on
auspicious occasions or on the performance of meritorious deeds (such as
the consecration of ponds, &c.);

14\. To an uneven number on other (occasions).

15 <span id="fr_509"></span>[15](#fn_508.md). The rite is performed from
left to right. Barley is to be used instead of sesamum.
