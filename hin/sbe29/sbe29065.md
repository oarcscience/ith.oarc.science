*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 3.

1 <span id="fr_241"></span>[1](#fn_240). Now (follows.md) the
Sapi*nd*îkara*n*a (i.e. reception of a dead person into the community of
Pi*nd*a-offerings with the other Manes).

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

2 <span id="fr_242"></span>[2](#fn_241.md). When one year has elapsed, or
three half-months,

3\. Or on a day when something good happens,

4\. He fills four water-pots with sesamum, scents, and water,

5\. Three for the fathers, one for the (newly) dead person,

6\. And pours the pot that belongs to the (newly) dead person out into
the pots of the fathers with the two verses, 'They who commonly'
(Vâ*g*asaneyi Sa*m*hitâ XIX, 45. 46).

7\. Thus also the lump (of flour).

8\. This is the Sapi*nd*îkara*n*a.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_240"></span>[109:1](sbe29065.htm#fr_241.md) 3, 1. It appears
to me that this whole chapter is a later addition to the original text.
The last Sûtra of the preceding chapter, treating of the omission of the
fourth 'father,' which forms, as shown in the preceding note, a
consequence of the Sapi*nd*îkara*n*a, <span id="page_110">p. 110</span>
supposes this ceremony to be known and to require no special
explanation. Had the intention of the author been to treat of the
Sapi*nd*îkara*n*a, this would have been the right place for mentioning
the *k*aturthavisarga, and not, as we really read it, the end of the
chapter treating of the Ekoddish*t*a. As pointing in the same direction
I will mention that the *S*âmbavya-G*ri*hya, while giving the first,
second, and fourth chapter of this Adhyâya, omits the third. Finally it
seems decisive to me that the fifth (Pari*s*ish*t*a) book of the
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya treats of the Sapi*nd*îkara*n*a in a whole chapter
(V, 9), which shows that the text itself, as the author of the
Pari*s*ish*t*a read it, gave no exposition of this ceremony.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[110:2](sbe29065.htm#fr_242.md) Nârâya*n*a says
that tripaksha means either three pakshas, i.e. one month and a half, or
one paksha deficient by three days, i.e. twelve days. We need not say
that the latter explanation is inadmissible it evidently rests on a
wrong conclusion drawn from a passage of another Sûtra quoted by him, in
which it is stated that the Sapi*nd*îkara*n*a should be performed
sa*m*vatsarânte dvâda*s*âhe vâ.
