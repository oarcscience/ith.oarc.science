------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 8.

1 <span id="fr_897"></span>[1](#fn_896.md). The spit-ox (sacrificed to
Rudra).

2 <span id="fr_898"></span>[2](#fn_897). It procures (to the sacrificer.md)
heavenly rewards, cattle, sons, wealth, renown, long life.

3 <span id="fr_899"></span>[8\_3](#fn_898.md). Having taken the sacred
domestic fire to the

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

forest, and having performed the 'outspreading,' he should sacrifice the
animal to Rudra.

4\. One that is not gelded.

5 <span id="fr_900"></span>[5](#fn_899). Or (it may be.md) a cow, on
account of the designation.

6 <span id="fr_901"></span>[6](#fn_900.md). Having cooked the omentum, a
mess of sacrificial food, and the portions cut off (of the victim), he
sacrifices the omentum to Rudra, the fat to the Air, and the cut-off
portions together with the mess of cooked food to Agni, Rudra, *S*arva,
Pa*s*upati, Ugra, A*s*ani, Bhava, Mahâdeva, [Î*s*âna](errata.htm#2.md).

7\. (Then follows a sacrifice to) Vanaspati.

8\. (To Agni) Svish*t*ak*ri*t at the end.

9 <span id="fr_902"></span>[9](#fn_901). Then (follows.md) the sprinkling
round to the different quarters (of the horizon).

10 <span id="fr_903"></span>[10](#fn_902.md). After the sprinkling has been
performed, they sacrifice the Patnî-sa*m*yâ*g*a offerings to Indrâ*n*î,
Rudrâ*n*î, *S*arvâ*n*i, Bhavânî, and Agni G*ri*hapati.

11 <span id="fr_904"></span>[11](#fn_903.md). The blood he offers in
leaves, on (grass-) bunches, as a Bali to Rudra and to his hosts, with
(the Mantras),

'The hosts, Rudra, which thou hast to the east, to them this Bali (is
given). To them and to thee be adoration!

'The hosts, Rudra, which thou hast to the south . . . to the west . . .
to the north . . . upwards . . .

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

downwards, to them this Bali (is given). To them and to thee be
adoration!'

12 <span id="fr_905"></span>[12](#fn_904.md). The contents of the stomach
and of the entrails, besmeared with blood, he throws into the fire or
buries them in the earth.

13 <span id="fr_906"></span>[13](#fn_905.md). Having placed the animal so
that the wind blows from himself to it, he approaches it with the Rudra
hymns, or with the first and last Anuvâka.

14\. They do not take anything of that animal to the village.

15 <span id="fr_907"></span>[15](#fn_906). Thereby (also.md) the
cow-sacrifice has been declared.

16\. (It is combined) with (the offering of) milk-rice; (the rites) not
corresponding (to that special occasion) are omitted.

17\. The sacrificial fee at that (sacrifice) is a cow of the same age
(as the victim).

<span id="fn_898"></span>[351:8\_3](sbe29198.htm#fr_899.md) The
'outspreading' is the establishing of the three sacred *S*rauta fires,
so that the G*ri*hya fire is considered as the Gârhapatya, and the
Âhavanîya and Dakshi*n*âgni are taken from it.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[352:5](sbe29198.htm#fr_900.md) On account of the
designation of the sacrifice as *s*ûla-gava.
