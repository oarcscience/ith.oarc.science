*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 5.

1\. 'To every able one, to every blissful one, to you I turn for the
sake of safety, of peace. Free from danger may we be. May the village
give me in charge to the forest. All! give me in charge to the great
one,'—thus (he speaks) when leaving the village.

2\. 'May the forest give me in charge to the village. Great one! give me
in charge to the all'—thus (he speaks) when entering the village, not
without (carrying) something (with himself, such as fuel, flowers, &c.)

3 <span id="fr_213"></span>[3](#fn_212). I enter the blessed, joyful
house, which does not bring death to men; manly (I enter) that which is
rich in men. Bringing refreshment, dropping ghee (we enter the house) in
which I shall joyfully rest'—this verse is constantly to be pronounced
(when he enters the house).
