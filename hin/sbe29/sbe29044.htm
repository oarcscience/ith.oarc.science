The rules regarding the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva sacrifice stand here, as I have already pointed out in the German edition, p. 142, in a very strange position amid the matter that concerns the student, and before the description of the ceremony that concludes studentship (the Sam&acirc;vartana; III, 1). On the first word of the chapter, atha, N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a observes that thereby the householder is marked as the subject of the following rules. It seems rather forced to explain the position of this chapter, as N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a does, by pointing out that in some cases, for instance when the teacher is away on a journey, a student also can eventually be called upon to perform the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva sacrifice (comp. below, chap. 17, 3).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_187"></A><A HREF="sbe29044.htm#fr_188">84:2</A> This S&ucirc;tra shows, according to N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, that the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva offering does not follow the ordinary type of sacrifice (the Prati<I>s</I>rute homakalpa, as it is termed above, I, 9, 19), but the form described in the Agnik&acirc;ryaprakara<I>n</I>a, above, chap. 10, 3 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_188"></A><A HREF="sbe29044.htm#fr_189">85:6-7</A> 6, 7. The distribution of Balis begins in the east, which is the part of the horizon sacred to Indra; it then proceeds to the south, the west, the north, which are sacred respectively to Yama, Varu<I>n</I>a, and Soma. Finally the Bali belonging to B<I>ri</I>haspati and the B&acirc;rhaspatyas is offered, according to N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, to the north-east.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_189"></A><A HREF="sbe29044.htm#fr_190">85:8</A> The commentators (see p. 142 of the German edition) differ as to whether &acirc;dityama<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala means the disk of the sun towards which this Bali should be offered, or a place or an apartment of circular form (&acirc;dityama<I>n</I><I>d</I>alar&ucirc;pe ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>al&acirc;g&acirc;re, as in my opinion we ought to correct the reading in N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's note).</P>
