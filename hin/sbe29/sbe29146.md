### ADHYÂYA IV, KA*ND*IKÂ 1.

1 <span id="fr_570"></span>[1](#fn_569.md). If disease befalls one who has
set up the (sacred *S*rauta) fires, he should leave his home (and go
away) to the eastern, or northern, or north-eastern direction.

2\. 'The sacred fires are fond of the village'—thus it is said.

3 <span id="fr_571"></span>[3](#fn_570.md). Longing for it, desirous of
returning to the village they might restore him to health-thus it is
understood (in the *S*ruti).

4 <span id="fr_572"></span>[4](#fn_571.md). Being restored to health, he
should offer a Soma sacrifice, or an animal sacrifice, or an ordinary
sacrifice, and take his dwelling (again in the village).

5 <span id="fr_573"></span>[5](#fn_572.md). Or without such a sacrifice.

6\. If he dies, one should have a piece of ground dug up to the
south-east or to the south-west—

7\. At a place which is inclined towards the south or towards the
south-east.

8\. According to some (teachers), inclined towards south-west.

9\. (The piece of ground dug up should be) of the length of a man with
upraised arms,

10\. Of the breadth of one Vyâma (fathom),

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

11\. Of the depth of one Vitasti (span).

12 <span id="fr_574"></span>[12](sbe29147.htm#fn_578.md). The cemetery
should be free from all sides.

13\. It should be fertile in herbs.

14 <span id="fr_575"></span>[14](#fn_573.md). But plants with thorns and
with milky juice, &c., as stated above.

15 <span id="fr_576"></span>[15](#fn_574.md). From which the waters flow
off to all sides: this is a characteristic required for the cemetery
(*s*ma*s*âna) where the body is to be burned.

16 <span id="fr_577"></span>[16](#fn_575.md). 'They cut off (from the dead
body) the hair, the beard, the hairs of the body, and the nails'—this
has been stated above.

17 <span id="fr_578"></span>[17](#fn_576). (They should provide.md) plenty
of sacrificial grass and of butter.

18 <span id="fr_579"></span>[18](#fn_577.md). They here pour clarified
butter into curds.

19\. This is the 'sprinkled butter' used for the Fathers (i.e. Manes).
