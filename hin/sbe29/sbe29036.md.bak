### KHA*ND*A 6.

1 <span id="fr_143"></span>[1-2](#fn_142.md). 'Waters are ye by name; happy
ones are ye by name; sappy ones are ye by name; undecaying ones are ye
by name; fearless ones are ye by name; immortal ones are ye by name. Of
you, being such, may I partake; receive me into your favour'—with these
words (the teacher) makes the student sip water three times,

2 <span id="fr_144"></span>[2](#fn_143.md). And hands over to him the staff
with the five

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

verses, 'Blessing may give us' (Rig-veda V, 51, 11-15).

3 <span id="fr_145"></span>[3](#fn_144.md). An optional gift is the fee for
the sacrifice.

4 <span id="fr_146"></span>[4](#fn_145). After (the teacher.md) has led him
round the fire, turning his right side towards it, (the student) goes
through the village to beg food.

5\. (Let him beg,) however, of his mother first,

6\. Or of a woman who will not refuse.

7 <span id="fr_147"></span>[7](#fn_146.md). Having announced the alms to
his teacher, he may eat (the food himself) with the master's permission.

8\. The daily putting on of fuel, the going for alms, the sleeping on
the ground, and obedience to the teacher: these are the standing duties
of a student.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_142"></span>[67:1-2](sbe29036.htm#fr_143.md) 6, 1, 2.
Râma*k*andra: '. . . with this Mantra which the teacher tells him, and
which he (the student) pronounces, he sips water <span id="page_68">p.
68</span> three times . . . He (the teacher) then gives him again the
staff, which he had given him before silently.' I do not think that this
double handing over of the staff agrees with the real meaning of the
text; Gobhila also (II, 10) and Â*s*valâyana (I, 22, 1) prescribe the
da*nd*apradâna after the repetition of the Sâvitrî, without mentioning
that the same had been already done before; Pâraskara II, 2, II speaks
of the handing over of the staff before the recital of the Sâvitrî, and
does not state that it should be repeated afterwards.

All these ceremonies, the teaching of the Sâvitrî as well as the
da*nd*apradâna, were considered as forming part of the Upanayana, even
though a longer or shorter space of time (chap. 5, 1-3) might elapse
between the first arrival of the student at the teacher's house and the
performing of these rites. This follows from chap. 11, Sûtras 2-4.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[67:2](sbe29036.htm#fr_144.md) These five verses
have already occurred above at I, 15, 12.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[68:3](sbe29036.htm#fr_145.md) Comp. I, 14, 13-15.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[68:4](sbe29036.htm#fr_146.md) 4 seq. On the
student's begging of alms compare the more detailed rules in Pâraskara
II, 5; Âpastamba I, 3, &c.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[68:7](sbe29036.htm#fr_147.md) Comp. the passages
quoted by Professor Bühler on Âpastamba I, 3, 31 (S.B.E., vol. ii, p.
22).
