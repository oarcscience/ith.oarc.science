*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 3.

1\. Now after they have entered the circle—

2 <span id="fr_330"></span>[2-3](#fn_329.md). The teacher sits down with
his face to the east, the others, according to their rank, (sit down)
towards the south, with their faces to the north.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

3\. If that is impossible, with their faces to all directions.

4\. Let them expect the rising of the sun,

5\. And when they behold it in its splendour,

6 <span id="fr_331"></span>[6](#fn_330). Let them with (the words.md),
'Recite, sir!' seize with their hands, holding the right hand uppermost,
the feet of the teacher, which have been washed, with the right (hand)
the right (foot), with the left the left,

7 <span id="fr_332"></span>[7](#fn_331). And having then put (the hands.md)
into the vessel used for the expiation, into water in which pieces of
Dûrvâ stalks are, let them begin their study, when their hands have
ceased to drip.

8\. This is the rite. But when they are tired, let one of them bring it
about that the vessel used for the expiation be not empty.

9\. And all (should do so) at the beginning and the end of (each)
Adhyâya.

10 <span id="fr_333"></span>[10](#fn_332). (All.md) that is done
continuously, without interruption.

11\. Now the expiation.

12 <span id="fr_334"></span>[12](#fn_333.md). The syllable OM, the
Mahâvyâh*ri*tis, the Sâvitrî, the Rathantara, the B*ri*hat, the
Vâmadevya; B*ri*hat and Rathantara with repetition and Kakubh-forming.

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

13 <span id="fr_335"></span>[13](#fn_334). These (holy words and verses.md)
are (thus) made to attain (the number of) ten.

14 <span id="fr_336"></span>[14](#fn_335.md). 'Of decades consists the
Virâ*g*'—thus says the Brâhma*n*a.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_329"></span>[143:2-3](sbe29095.htm#fr_330.md) 3, 2, 3. Comp.
IV, 8, 2-4.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[144:6](sbe29095.htm#fr_331.md) Comp. above, II,
5, 10, &c.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[144:7](sbe29095.htm#fr_332.md) The translation of
apinvamânai*h* pâ*n*ibhi*h* is conjectural. Nârâya*n*a's explanation of
apinvamâna by asa*m*s*ri*sh*t*a is inadmissible.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[144:10](sbe29095.htm#fr_333.md) Nârâya*n*a
explains this Sûtra in the following way. if it is impossible, for any
reason, to recite the whole text, only the beginning and the concluding
words of each Adhyâya (see Sûtra 9) are to be repeated; and these should
be recited without interruption so as to form one continual text.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[144:12](sbe29095.htm#fr_334.md) Comp. above, III,
4, 5.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[145:13](sbe29095.htm#fr_335.md) The Gâyatrî is
one verse; the Rathantara and the B*ri*hat are Pragâthas which are
changed in the usual way into T*rik*as; the Vâmadevya is one T*rik*a:
thus the number of ten is obtained.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[145:14](sbe29095.htm#fr_336.md) Kaush. Brâhma*n*a
17, 3; 19, 5.
