3 <span id="fr_326"></span>[3](#fn_325). Let them go to a clean spot in
the north-eastern direction, that receives its light from the east.

4\. The drawing of water (should be done) before sunrise,

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

5 <span id="fr_327"></span>[5](#fn_326). And the entering into the
circle with this verse, 'She who smells of salve' (Rig-veda X, 146, 6).

6 <span id="fr_328"></span>[6](#fn_327). The circle should have its
entrance to the east or to the north; it should be (praised as)
excellent among the people, not too spacious, not too narrow.

7 <span id="fr_329"></span>[7](#fn_328). The final expiation (should
extend) to the Vâmadevya.

8\. And the invitation to resume the recitation (is done in the
following way)

9\. After they have sipped water that stands outside the circle,

10\. Let them resume the recitation, having performed the expiation.

11\. If the vessel used in the expiation is damaged, sprinkling (with
water forms) the expiatory act (to be performed for it).

12\. (That) sprinkling, however, (one should perform) holding gold or a
bunch of Darbha grass in his hand.

13\. So far what pertains to the general rules.

Perhaps the Petersburg Dictionary is right in proposing for
prâg*g*yotisham the translation, vor Anbruch des Lichtes. Nârâya*n*a
says, prâk purastât *g*yotir yasmin tam . . . prade*s*am.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[143:5](sbe29094.htm#fr_327) The Ma*nd*ala is a
circular space marked by a line of water.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[143:6](sbe29094.htm#fr_328) I am doubtful
whether we should read vâ *g*anâgrîyam and translate as I have done in
accordance with the note of Nârâya*n*a, or if the reading should be
vâ<sup>ऽ</sup>*g*anâgrîyam, 'not in the presence of people,' so that
*g*anâgriya would mean *g*anânâm agre.
