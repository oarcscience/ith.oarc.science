### KA*ND*IKÂ 6.

1\. They who have lost a Guru by death, or are afflicted by other
misfortune, should perform on the new-moon day an expiatory ceremony.

2 <span id="fr_616"></span>[2](#fn_615.md). Before sunrise they should
carry their fire

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

together with its ashes and with its receptacle to the south with the
half-verse, 'I send far away the flesh-devouring Agni' (Rig-veda X, 16,
9).

3 <span id="fr_617"></span>[3](#fn_616). Having thrown that (fire.md) down
at a place where four roads meet or somewhere else, they walk round it
three times, turning their left sides towards it, beating their left
thighs with their left hands.

4\. They then should return home without looking back, bathe in water,
have their hair, their beards the hair of their bodies, and their nails
cut, and furnish themselves with new jars, pots, vessels for rinsing the
mouth, wreathed with garlands of *S*amî flowers, with fuel of *S*amî
wood, with two pieces of *S*amî wood for kindling fire, and with
branches to be laid round the fire, with bull's dung and a bull's hide,
fresh butter, a stone, and as many bunches of Ku*s*a grass as there are
young women (in the house).

5 <span id="fr_618"></span>[5](#fn_617). At the time of the Agni(-hotra.md)
he should kindle fire with the hemistich, 'Here may this other
*G*âtavedas' (Rig-veda X, 16, 9).

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

6\. Keeping that (fire) burning, they sit till the silence of the night,
repeating the tales of the aged, and getting stories of auspicious
contents, Itihâsas and Purâ*n*as, told to them.

7 <span id="fr_619"></span>[7](#fn_618.md). When all sounds have ceased, or
when (the others) have gone to the house or the resting-place, (the
performer of the ceremony) should pour out an uninterrupted stream of
water, beginning at the south side of the door, with (the verse),
'Spinning the thread follow the light of the aerial space' (Rig-veda X,
53, 6), (going round the house), ending at the north side of the door.

8 <span id="fr_620"></span>[8](#fn_619.md). Having then given its place to
the fire, and having spread to the west of it a bull's hide with the
neck to the east, with the hair outside, he should cause the people
belonging to the house to step on that (hide) with (the verse), 'Arise
to long life, choosing old age' (Rig-veda X, 18, 6).

9\. With (the verse), 'This I lay round the living' (Rig-veda X, 18, 4),
he should lay branches round (the fire).

10 <span id="fr_621"></span>[10](#fn_620.md). After having with (the
words), 'A mountain (i.e. a stone) they shall place between themselves
and death,' placed a stone to the north of the fire, and having
sacrificed with the four (verses), 'Go hence, O death, on another way'
(Rig-veda X, 18, 1-4),

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

verse by verse, he should look at his people with (the verse), 'As the
days follow each other' (ibid. 5).

11\. The young women (belonging to the house) should, with each hand
separately, with their thumbs and fourth fingers, with young Darbha
blades, salve their eyes with fresh butter, and throw (the Darbha
blades) away, turning their faces away.

12\. (The performer of the ceremony) should look at them, while they are
salving themselves, with (the verse), 'These women, being no widows,
having noble husbands' (Rig-veda X, 18, 7).

13\. With (the verse), 'Carrying stones, (the river) streams forward;
take hold of each other' (Rig-veda X, 53, 8)—the performer (of the
ceremony) first should touch the stone.

14\. After that, stationing himself to the northeast, while (the others)
go round with the fire, with bull's dung, and with an uninterrupted
stream of water, repeating the three verses, 'O waters, ye are
wholesome' (Rig-veda X, 9, i seqq.), he should murmur the verse, 'These
have led round the cow' (Rig-veda X, 155, 5).

15\. A tawny-coloured bull should he lead round—thus they say.

16\. They then sit down at a place where they intend to tarry, having
put on garments that have not yet been washed.

17\. (There) they sit, avoiding to sleep, till sunrise.

18 <span id="fr_622"></span>[18](#fn_621.md). After sunrise, having
murmured the hymns sacred to the sun and the auspicious hymns, having

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

prepared food, having made oblations with (the hymn), 'May he drive evil
away from us with his shine' (Rig-veda I, 97), verse by verse, having
given to the Brâhma*n*as to eat, he should cause (them) to pronounce
auspicious words.

19\. A cow, a cup of metal, and a garment that has not yet been washed,
constitute the sacrificial fee.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_615"></span>[246:2](sbe29151.htm#fr_616.md) 6, 2. According to
Nârâya*n*a the fire means here not the sacred domestic fire, but a
common kitchen fire. I doubt whether the <span id="page_247">p.
247</span> commentator is right. The ceremonies described in the
following Sûtras seem to point rather to a renewal of the sacred
G*ri*hya fire, the old one having proved unlucky to the sacrificer. In
the same way, in the *S*rauta ritual, a sacrificer who, after having
performed the Âdhâna, has bad luck, performs the Punarâdheya.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[247:3](sbe29151.htm#fr_617.md) Comp.
Kâtyâyana-*S*rauta-sûtra V, 10, r5.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[247:5](sbe29151.htm#fr_618.md) The text has
agnivelâyâm, which Nârâya*n*a explains by agnihotravihara*n*akâle
aparâhne. He states that the fire should be produced by attrition of two
new kindling woods (ara*n*i), mentioned in Sûtra 4. The fire thus
kindled is to be used, he says, as a kitchen-fire. Herein he seems to me
to have misunderstood the meaning of the ceremony; see the note on Sûtra
2. The hemistich quoted in this Sûtra (which is the second half of the
same verse of which the first half is prescribed in Sûtra 2) clearly
points to the sacred quality of the fire in question; it runs thus,
'Here may this other *G*âtavedas carry the offerings to the gods, the
knowing one.'

<span id="fn_618"></span>[248:7](sbe29151.htm#fr_619.md) The person who
pours out the water is, as Nârâya*n*a says, the kart*ri*, i.e. the
performer of the whole ceremony. The word cannot be translated, as Prof.
Stenzler does, der Bestatter, no funeral ceremonies being here treated
of.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[248:8](sbe29151.htm#fr_620.md) See above, I, 8,
9. Here Nârâya*n*a sees that the fire is the sacred one. He says,
atha*s*abdo<sup>ऽ</sup>smin kâle<sup>ऽ</sup>gnyantaram aupâsanam
upasamâdadhyâd iti *gñ*âpanârtham.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[248:10](sbe29151.htm#fr_621.md) The words, 'A
mountain,' &c., stand at the end of the verse quoted in Sûtra 9.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[249:18](sbe29151.htm#fr_622.md) See above, II, 3,
13.
