### KHA*ND*A 16.

1 <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_90.md). 'A bull's hide'—this has been
declared.

2 <span id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_91.md). On that hide the husband makes
her sit down and sacrifices, while she takes hold of him, four oblations
(with the following formulas),

3\. 'With god Agni, with the earth-world of the worlds, and the Rig-veda
of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., svâhâ!

'With god Vâyu, with the air-world of the worlds,

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

with the Ya*g*ur-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N.,
svâhâ!

'With god Sûrya, with the heaven-world of the worlds, with the Sâma-veda
of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., svâhâ!

'With god *K*andra, with the world of the quarters (of the horizon) of
the worlds, with the Brahma-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee,
N.N., svâhâ!'

4\. Or, 'Bhû*h*! What harm dwells in thee, bringing death to thy
husband, death to thy husband's brother, that I make death-bringing to
thy paramour, N.N., svâhâ!'—thus the first (of the before-mentioned
formulas) may be joined with the first Mahâvyâh*ri*ti, the second with
the second, the third with the third, the fourth with (the three
Mahâvyâh*ri*tis) together.

5\. With (the verse), 'With no evil eye' (Rig-veda X, 85, 44), let him
besmear (her) eyes with Â*g*ya salve.

6\. (The bridegroom,) having touched the ends of her hair with the three
(verses), 'How may us the resplendent one . . .' (Rig-veda IV, 31, 1-3),

7\. And having quickly recited the four verses, 'And those divine
medicines' (Rig-veda VIII, 18, 8), at the end (of that text) with the
word svâhâ (pours out) the remainder on (her) head.

8 <span id="fr_93"></span>[8](#fn_92.md). Here some place a boy of good
birth on both sides, in her lap, with this (verse), 'Into thy womb' (see
below, chap. 19, 6),

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

9\. Or also silently.

10\. Into this (boy's) joined hands (the bridegroom) gives fruits and
causes (the Brâhma*n*as) to wish an auspicious day.

11\. Thus she becomes the mother of male children.

12\. With the rest of the hymn, 'Stay ye here both' (Rig-veda X, 85, 42
seq.), they make them enter the house.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_90"></span>[41:1](sbe29018.htm#fr_91.md) 16, 1. In chap. 15,
22 it is said that the bride arrives at the house; in 16, 12, that she
enters the house. Probably we are to understand, therefore, that the
sacrifice prescribed in this chapter, Sûtras 2 seq., is performed before
the house, like the Vâstoshpatîya karman (below, III, 4). The words,
'has been declared,' refer to the *S*rauta-sûtra (IV, r6, 2), 'Having
spread a red bull's skin, with the neck to the north or to the east,
with the hair outside, behind the fire, they sit down,' &c.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[41:2](sbe29018.htm#fr_92.md) On anvârambha comp.
the quotation in the note on chap. II, 2.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[42:8](sbe29018.htm#fr_93.md) It should be noted
that the verse â te yonim is quoted here only with the Pratika, while
its full text is given below, chap. 19, 6. Can the Sûtras describing
this ceremony with the kumâra ubhayata*h*-su*g*âta be a later addition?
