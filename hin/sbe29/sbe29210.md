### KHA*ND*A 3.

1 <span id="fr_987"></span>[1](#fn_986). A student after he has studied
the Veda and has offered a present to his teacher, should, with
permission (of his parents), take a wife.

2 <span id="fr_988"></span>[2](#fn_987). And (he should take) the bath
(which signifies the end of studentship).

3 <span id="fr_989"></span>[3-4](#fn_988). Of these two (acts the taking
of) the bath comes first.

3, 1. brahma*k*ârî vedam adhîtyopanyâh*ri*tya

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

4\. As, however, in the (collection of) Mantras marriage is treated of
(first), it is explained (here) before (the bath).

5 <span id="fr_990"></span>[5](#fn_989). A Brâhma*n*a with a water-pot,
wrapped in his robe, keeping silence, should step in front of the fire
and should station himself (to the south of it) with his face to the
north.

6 <span id="fr_991"></span>[6](#fn_990). After (the bride) has taken a
bath, (the bridegroom) should dress her in a garment that has not yet
been washed, with (the verse), 'They who spun' (MB. I, 1, 5). While she
is led up (to him), the bridegroom should murmur (the verse), 'Soma gave
her' (l.l. 7).

7 <span id="fr_992"></span>[7](#fn_991). To the south of the bridegroom
he (who has led her to him) should make her sit down.

8\. While she touches him, (the bridegroom) should make oblations of
Â*g*ya with the Sruva, picking out (portions of it \[comp. Pâraskara II,
14, 131), with the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis.

9\. A fourth (oblation) with (the three Mahâvyâh*ri*tis) together.

10\. The same at the ceremonies of the tonsure (of the child's head), of
the initiation (of the Brahma*k*ârin), and of the cutting of the beard.

4\. mantrâbhivâdât tu pâ*n*igraha*n*asya (correct, pâ*n*igraha*n*a*m*?)

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

11\. And at the marriage (he makes oblations) with the six verses, 'May
Agni go as the first' (MB. I, I, 9 seqq.).

12\. At Â*g*ya oblations, unless a special rule is given, the two Â*g*ya
portions and the Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation (are) not (offered).

13\. After (the chief oblations he should) always (make oblations) with
the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis,

14 <span id="fr_993"></span>[14-15](#fn_992). And with the (verse)
sacred to Pra*g*âpati.

15\. He should make an expiatory oblation.

16 <span id="fr_994"></span>[16-31](#fn_993). After the sacrifice they
both arise.

17\. (The bridegroom) should pass behind (the bride's) back, station
himself to the south, and seize the bride's hand.

18\. Her mother who has, towards the east, put fried grain mixed with
*S*amî leaves into a basket,

19\. Should make the bride tread with the tip of her right foot on an
upper mill-stone, to the west of the fire, with (the verse which the
bridegroom repeats), 'On this stone' (MB. I, 2, 1).

20\. Her brother, filling once his joined hands

with fried grain, should pour it into the bride's joined hands.

21 <span id="fr_996"></span>[21](#fn_995). Or some friend (instead of
the brother).

22\. That she should sacrifice over the fire without opening her joined
hands with (the verse which the bridegroom repeats), 'This woman' (MB.
I, 2, 2).

23\. (The verses), 'Aryaman' and 'Pûshan' (l.l. 3, 4) (are repeated) at
the two following (oblations of fried grain).

24\. After that sacrifice he should go back in the same way (see Sûtra
17), and should lead her round the fire, so that their right sides are
turned towards it with (the formula), 'The maid from the fathers' (l.l.
5).

25\. (These rites), beginning from his stationing himself (to the south,
Sûtra 17), (are performed) thrice.

26\. After (she) has poured the remnants (of the fried grain) into the
fire, he should make her step forward in a north-eastern direction with
(the formula), 'For sap with one step' (l.l. 6, 7).

27\. The looking at the lookers-on, the mounting of the chariot, the
reciting (of Mantras) at places difficult to pass (on the way of the
bridegroom and the bride, is performed) with (verses) suited (to those
different occasions).

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

28\. Walking forward behind the fire, the water-carrier (see Sûtra 5)
should besprinkle the bridegroom on his forehead.

29\. So also the bride.

30\. When he has thus been besprinkled, (he should repeat the verse),
'May (the Vi*s*ve devâs) anoint (or, unite)' (MB. I, 2, 9).

31\. He should seize her right hand, together with the thumb, with the
six (verses), 'I seize thy hand' (MB. I, 2, 10 seqq.).
