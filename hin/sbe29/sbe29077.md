### KHA*ND*A 15.

1\. The *S*rava*n*a (oblation) he offers on the full moon day that falls
under (the Nakshatra) *S*ravish*th*âs, of the flour of fried barley, or
of cooked food,

2\. With (the words), 'To Vish*n*u svâhâ! To (the Nakshatra) *S*rava*n*a
svâhâ! To the full moon of *S*râva*n*a svâhâ! To the rainy season
svâhâ!'

3\. Having established the (sacred) domestic fire outside, and having
mixed together fried grain and the flour of fried barley with butter, he
sacrifices—

4\. With (the words), 'To the Lord of the celestial Serpents svâhâ! To
the celestial Serpents svâhâ!'

5\. Having placed to the north of the fire a new water-pot on
eastward-pointed, fresh Ku*s*a grass,

6\. With (the words), 'May the Lord of the celestial Serpents wash
himself! May the celestial Serpents wash themselves!'—he pours water
into it.

7 <span id="fr_287"></span>[7](#fn_286). With (the words.md), 'May the Lord
of the celestial Serpents comb himself! May the celestial Serpents comb
themselves!'—he makes movements with a comb.

8\. With (the words), 'May the Lord of the celestial Serpents paint
himself! May the celestial Serpents paint themselves!'—he pours out
portions of paint.

9\. With (the words), 'May the Lord of the celestial Serpents tie (this)
to (himself)! May the celestial Serpents tie (this) to themselves!'—he
offers flowers.

10\. With (the words), 'May the Lord of the celestial Serpents clothe
himself! May the celestial Serpents clothe themselves!'—he offers a
thread.

11\. With (the words), 'May the Lord of the celestial Serpents anoint

thrice each time, the first (part) with higher voice each time,

18\. The second (part) with lower voice each time.

19 <span id="fr_289"></span>[19](#fn_288.md). In this way he shall offer
day by day with the spoon, in small portions, a Bali of the flour of
fried barley with water, down to the Pratyavaroha*n*a (or the ceremony
of the 'redescent'), at night, keeping silence.

20 <span id="fr_290"></span>[20](#fn_289). And (his wife) shall put (it.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_286"></span>[128:7](sbe29077.htm#fr_287.md) 15, 7. For this
signification of pha*n*a, comp. *K*ullavagga V, 2, 3.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[129:17-18](sbe29077.htm#fr_288.md) 17, 18. The
text has u*kk*aistarâm—u*kk*aistarâm, and nî*k*aistarâ*m*—nî*k*aistarâm.
Nârâya*n*a(comp. the text of his scholion, p. 155 of the German edition)
understands this in a different way; he says that in the water-pot
mentioned in the fifth Sûtra two different sthânas are to be
distinguished, a higher part of it and a lower (uttarâdharatayâ). Now
when the sacrificer, for instance, as prescribed in Sûtra 6, invites the
Lord of the celestial Serpents, and the celestial Serpents to wash
themselves, the pouring out of water would have to be performed first
thrice for the Lord of the celestial Serpents in the higher place, then
thrice for the celestial Serpents in the lower place.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[129:19](sbe29077.htm#fr_289.md) On the
Pratyavaroha*n*a see chap. 17.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[129:20](sbe29077.htm#fr_290.md) Nârâya*n*a:
vâgyamayuktâ ya*g*amânapatnî eva*m* balidravyâdikam upasâdayet.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[129:22](sbe29077.htm#fr_291.md) 'From the
*S*râva*n*î till the Âgrahâya*n*î (see chap. 1 7, 1) one shall not sleep
on the ground out of fear of the snakes.' Nârâya*n*a.
