### KA*ND*IKÂ 14.

1\. Now the mounting of a chariot (is declared).

2\. After he has given the order, 'Put the horses to it,' and it has
been announced, 'They are,' he goes to (the chariot, saying), 'This is
the Virâ*g*,' and touches the two wheels,

3\. The right (wheel) with (the words), 'The Rathantara art thou'—

4\. The left with (the words), 'The B*ri*hat art thou'—

5\. The pole with (the words), 'The Vâmadevya art thou.'

6 <span id="fr_954"></span>[6](#fn_953). He touches the interior of the
chariot with his hand (saying), 'The two Aṅkas, the two Nyaṅkas which
are on both sides of the chariot, which move forward with the rushing
wind, the far-darting one with keen senses, the winged one, may these
fires, the promoters, promote us.'

7 <span id="fr_955"></span>[7](#fn_954). With (the words), 'Adoration to
Mâ*n*i*k*ara,' he drives on the beast on the right side.

8\. (If going in his chariot) toward (images of) gods, let him descend
(from the chariot) before he has reached them; if toward Brâhma*n*as,
just before (reaching them); if toward cows, when amid them; if toward
fathers, when he has reached them.

9\. A woman or a Vedic student shall not be charioteers.

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

10\. Having driven a moment beyond (the point to which he intends to go)
he should murmur, 'Here is rest, rest here' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. VIII, 51).

11 <span id="fr_956"></span>[11](#fn_955). Some add (the words), 'Here
shall be no rest.'

12\. If the chariot is weak, he should murmur, after he has mounted it,
'May this your chariot, O A*s*vins, suffer no damage on bad ways or by
being overthrown.'

13 <span id="fr_957"></span>[13](#fn_956). If the horses run away with
the chariot, he should touch the post (?) or the earth and should
murmur, 'May this your chariot, O A*s*vins, suffer no damage on bad ways
or by being overthrown.'

14\. Thus he will suffer no harm and no damage.

15 <span id="fr_958"></span>[15](#fn_957). When he has finished his way,
and has unyoked the horses, let him have grass and water given to them.
'For thus satisfaction is given to the beast that draws (the cart)'—says
the *S*ruti.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_953"></span>[364:6](sbe29204.htm#fr_954) 14, 6. The meaning
of aṅkau and nyaṅkau cannot be determined, as far as I can see. The
commentators explain the words as the two wheels and the two sides of
the chariot, or as the two right wheels and the two left wheels of a
four-wheeled chariot. Professor Zimmer (Altindisches Leben, pp. 251
seq.) compares aṅka with ἄντυξ, and says, 'Mit aṅkau (resp. aṅkû) ware
daher die obere Einfassung des Wagenkastens (ko*s*a, vandhura)
bezeichnet, mit nyaṅkau (resp. nyaṅkû) ein zu grösserer Befestigung
etwas weiter unten (ni) herumlaufender Stab.' To me it seems that aṅkau
and nyaṅkau are to be understood both as designations of certain parts
of the chariot and as names of different forms of Agni dwelling in the
chariot.—Comp. Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ I, 7, 7, 2; Pa*ñk*avi*ms*a
Brâhma*n*a I, 7, 5.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[364:7](sbe29204.htm#fr_955) The name of the
demon Mâ*n*i*k*ara occurs, as far as I know, only here.

<span id="fn_955"></span>[365:11](sbe29204.htm#fr_956) If the reading of
the text is correct, the meaning would seem to be: We will rest here for
a while, but then we will go further.

<span id="fn_956"></span>[365:13](sbe29204.htm#fr_957) I cannot say what
'the post' (stambha) here means; it may be apart of the chariot.
*G*ayarâma has dhva*g*astambha, i.e. the staff of a flag, which we are
to suppose was carried on the chariot. This may be the right
explanation.

Brâhma*n*a I, 8, 2, 9.
