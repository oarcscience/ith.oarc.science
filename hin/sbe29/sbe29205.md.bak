### KA*ND*IKÂ 15.

1\. Now how he should mount an elephant.

2\. He goes to the elephant and touches it (saying), 'The elephants’
glory art thou. The elephants’ honour art thou.'

3\. He then mounts it with (the words), 'With Indra's thunder-bolt I
bestride thee. Make me arrive safely.'

4\. Thereby it has also been declared how he should mount a horse.

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

5\. When he is going to mount a camel, he addresses it: 'Thou art the
son of Tvash*tri*; Tvash*tri* is thy deity. Make me arrive safely.'

6 <span id="fr_959"></span>[6](#fn_958.md). When he is going to mount a
he-ass, he addresses it: 'A *S*ûdra art thou, a *S*ûdra by birth. To
Agni thou belongest, with twofold sperm. Make me arrive safely.'

7\. A path he addresses: 'Adoration to Rudra who dwells on the paths.
Make me arrive safely.'

8\. A cross-road he addresses: 'Adoration to Rudra who dwells at the
cross-roads. Make me arrive safely.'

9\. When he intends to swim across a river, he addresses it: 'Adoration
to Rudra who dwells in the waters. Make me arrive safely.'

10\. When going on board a ship, he addresses her: 'The good ship'
(Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXI, 7).

11\. When going to cross (the river), he addresses (the ship): 'The
well-protecting' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXI, 6).

12\. A forest (through which he is wandering) he addresses: 'Adoration
to Rudra who dwells in the forests. Make me arrive safely.'

13\. A mountain (which he is going to cross) he addresses: 'Adoration to
Rudra who dwells on the mountains. Make me arrive *s*afely.'

14\. A burial-ground he addresses: 'Adoration to Rudra who dwells among
the Fathers. Make me arrive safely.'

15\. A cow-stable he addresses: 'Adoration to Rudra who dwells among the
dung-heaps. Make me arrive safely.'

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

16\. And wheresoever else it be, let him always say, 'Adoration to
Rudra.' For the *S*ruti says, 'Rudra is this universe.'

17\. If the skirt (of his garment) is blown upon him (by the wind), he
addresses (that skirt): 'A skirt art thou. Thou art not a thunder-bolt.
Adoration be to thee. Do no harm to me!'

18\. The thunder he addresses: 'May the rains be friendly to us; may
(Indra's) darts be friendly to us—may they be friendly to us which thou
throwest, O killer of V*ri*tra.'

19 <span id="fr_960"></span>[19](#fn_959.md). A howling jackal he
addresses: 'Friendly by name' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. III, 63).

20 <span id="fr_961"></span>[20](#fn_960.md). A shrieking bird he
addresses: 'Golden-winged bird who goest where the gods send thee!
Messenger of Yama, adoration be to thee! What has the Kârkâri*n*a told
thee?'

21\. A tree that serves as a mark (of a boundary, &c.), he addresses:
'May neither the flash of lightning (destroy thee), nor axe nor wind nor
punishment which the king sends. May thy shoots grow up; may rain fall
on thee, in safety from the wind. May fire not destroy thy root.
Blessing on thee, O lord of the forest! Blessing on me, O lord of the
forest!'

22\. If he receives something (given to him), he accepts it with (the
formula), 'May Heaven give thee; may the Earth accept thee.' Thus (the
thing given) does not decrease to him who gives it, and what he receives
increases.

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

23\. If boiled rice is given to him, he accepts it with (the formula),
'May Heaven, &c.,' and he partakes thereof twice. with (the formulas),
'May Brahman eat thee!'—'May Brahman partake of thee!'

24\. If gruel is given to him, (as above) . . . . three times with (the
formulas), 'May Brahman eat thee! '—'May Brahman partake of thee!'—'May
Brahman drink thee!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_958"></span>[366:6](sbe29205.htm#fr_959.md) The he-ass has
twofold sperm, because he begets both asses and mules. Taittirîya
Sa*m*hitâ VII, 1, 1, 2.

<span id="fn_959"></span>[367:19](sbe29205.htm#fr_960.md) The play on words
is untranslatable; 'jackal' is *s*ivâ, 'friendly,' *s*iva*h*.

<span id="fn_960"></span>[367:20](sbe29205.htm#fr_961.md) I do not know the
meaning of kârkâri*n*a*h*. *G*ayarâma takes it for a genitive standing
instead of an accusative, and explains it by asmadbâdhakam.
