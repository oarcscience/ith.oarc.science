### KA*ND*IKÂ. 2.

1 <span id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_362.md). Now he should make oblations in
the evening and in the morning of prepared sacrificial food,

2 <span id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_363.md). To the deities of the
Agnihotra, to Soma Vanaspati, to Agni and Soma, to Indra and Agni, to
Heaven and Earth, to Dhanvantari, to Indra, to the Vi*s*ve devâs, to
Brahman.

3 <span id="fr_365"></span>[3](#fn_364.md). He says Svâhâ, and then he
offers the Balis—

4\. To those same deities, to the waters, to the herbs and trees, to the
house, to the domestic deities, to the deities of the ground (on which
the house stands),

5 <span id="fr_366"></span>[5](#fn_365.md). To Indra and Indra's men, to
Yama and Yama's men, to Varu*n*a and Varu*n*a's men, to Soma and Soma's
men—these (oblations he makes) to the different quarters (of the
horizon, of which those are the presiding deities).

6\. To Brahman and Brahman's men in the middle,

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

7\. To the Vi*s*ve devâs, to all day-walking beings—thus by day;

8\. To the night-walking (beings)—thus at night.

9\. To the Rakshas—thus to the north.

10\. Svadhâ to the fathers (i.e. Manes)'—with these words he should pour
out the remnants to the south, with the sacrificial cord suspended over
the right shoulder.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_362"></span>[161:1](sbe29101.htm#fr_363.md) 2, 1. This is the
Vai*s*vadeva sacrifice; comp. *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya II, 14, &C.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[161:2](sbe29101.htm#fr_364.md) The deities of the
Agnihotra are Sûrya, Agni, and Pra*g*âpati. On Soma Vanaspati see the
quotations given in Böhtlingk-Roth's Dictionary s. v. vanaspati, 2.

<span id="fn_364"></span>[161:3](sbe29101.htm#fr_365.md) I think the
division of the Sûtras should be altered, so that svâheti would belong
to Sûtra 2, and the third Sûtra would consist only of the words atha
balihara*n*am. In this case we should have to translate,

\(1\) Now he should make oblations, &c.

\(2\) With the words, 'To the deities of the Agnihotra (i.e. to Agni, to
Sûrya, to Pra*g*âpati), to Soma Vanaspati, &c., svâhâ!'

\(3\) Then (follows) the offering of the Balis.

Comp. Sâṅkh.-G*ri*hya II, 14, 4. 5, which passage seems to confirm the
view expressed here.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[161:5](sbe29101.htm#fr_366.md) Manu III, 87.
