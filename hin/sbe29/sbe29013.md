### KHA*ND*A 11.

1 <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_70). Now when the bride is to be
carried away (to the bridegroom's house) that night, or on the next, or
on the third night,

2 <span id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_71). On that night, when (the darkness
of) night is gone, they wash the girl up to her head with (water that
has been made fragrant by) all sorts of herbs and the choicest fruits
together with scents;

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

3\. They put on her a newly-dyed garment or (a new one) which has not
yet been washed;

4 <span id="fr_73"></span>[4](#fn_72). Then (the Â*k*ârya of the bride's
family) makes the girl sit down behind the fire, and while she takes
hold of him he sacrifices with the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis, and then he makes
Â*g*ya oblations to Agni, to Soma, to Pra*g*âpati, to Mitra, to
Varu*n*a, to Indra, to Indrâ*n*î, to the Gandharva, to Bhaga, to Pûshan,
to Tvash*t*ar, to B*ri*haspati, to the king Pratyânîka.

5\. After they have regaled four or eight women, who are not widows,
with lumps of vegetables, Surâ, and food, these should perform a dance
four times.

6\. The same deities (they worship also) on behalf of the man,

7\. And Vai*s*rava*n*a and Î*s*âna.

8\. Then follows the distribution of food to Brâhma*n*as.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_70"></span>[31:1](sbe29013.htm#fr_71) 11, 1. The ceremony
described in this chapter is called Indrâ*n*îkarman. The goddess
Indrâ*n*î is mentioned in Sûtra 4 among the deities to whom Â*g*ya
oblations are made.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[31:2](sbe29013.htm#fr_72) Ni*s*âkâle, ni*s*â
madhyastha*m* praharadvaya*m*, tasmin kale atîte. Nârâya*n*a.

On the anvârambha, comp. Weber's Indische Studien, IX, 224.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[32:4](sbe29013.htm#fr_73) The 'king Pratyânîka'
has given origin to a very curious misunderstanding in the
*S*âmbavya-G*ri*hya and its commentary; see p. 127 of the German
edition.
