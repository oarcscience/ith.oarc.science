### KA*ND*IKÂ 9.

1 <span id="fr_555"></span>[1](#fn_554). (He says.md), 'Memory and reproach
and knowledge, faith, and wisdom as the fifth, what is sacrificed, and
what is given, and what is studied, and what is done, truth, learning,
vow—

'The vow which belongs to Agni together with Indra, with Pra*g*âpati,
with the *Ri*shis, with the royal ones among the *Ri*shis, with the
Fathers, with the royal ones among the Fathers, with the human beings,
with the royal ones among the human beings, with shine, over-shine,
after-shine, counter-shine, with gods and men, with Gandharvas and
Apsaras, with wild animals and domestic animals,—the vow, belonging to
my own self, dwelling in my own self, that is my universal vow. Hereby,
O Agni, I become addicted to the universal vow. Svâhâ!'

2 <span id="fr_556"></span>[2](#fn_555). With (the hymn.md), 'Mine, Agni,
be vigour' (Rig-veda X, 128, 1), verse by verse, he should put pieces of
wood (on the fire).

3 <span id="fr_557"></span>[3](#fn_556.md). He should pass that night at a
place where they will do honour to him.

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

4 <span id="fr_558"></span>[4](#fn_557.md). When, after having finished his
(task of) learning, he has offered something to the teacher, or has
received his permission, he should take a bath (which signifies the end
of his studentship).

5\. He (i.e. the Snâtaka) has to keep the following observances:

6\. He shall not bathe in the night-time; he shall not bathe naked; he
shall not lie down naked; he shall not look at a naked woman, except
during sexual intercourse; he shall not run during rain; he shall not
climb up a tree; he shall not descend into a well; he shall not swim
with his arms across a river; he shall not expose himself to danger. 'A
great being indeed is a Snâtaka'—thus it is understood (in the *S*ruti).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_554"></span>[229:1](sbe29142.htm#fr_555.md) 9, 1. '"My memory
and my non-memory, that is my double vow"—in this way the twelve (parts
of which the first section of the Mantra consists) should be recited.'
Nârâya*n*a. I think the commentator is wrong here, and that section
should rather be recited as it is given in the text without any
alteration; it forms a regular *S*loka. Agne*h* instead of Agne is a
conjecture of Prof. Stenzler, which I have adopted.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[229:2](sbe29142.htm#fr_556.md) According to
Nârâya*n*a the hymn should be recited including the Khila, so that ten
pieces of wood are offered. Now the hymn consists of nine verses; there
can be, consequently, only one Khailika verse, which is, I suppose, the
first verse of the Khila quoted above, p. 228.

<span id="fn_556"></span>[229:3](sbe29142.htm#fr_557.md) By a Madhuparka
(Nârâya*n*a). Compare *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya III, 1, 14.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[230:4](sbe29142.htm#fr_558.md) Nârâya*n*a: He
makes an offer to the teacher in the words, 'What is it that I can do
for you?'—and what the teacher tells him, that he does.
