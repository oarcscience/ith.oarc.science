------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 5.

1\. Here (follows the student's) going the rounds for alms.

2 <span id="fr_779"></span>[2-4](#fn_778.md). A Brâhma*n*a should beg,
addressing (the woman from whom he begs alms) with the word 'Lady' put
at the beginning (of his request),

3\. A Râ*g*anya, with the word 'Lady' inserted in the middle,

4\. A Vai*s*ya, with the word 'Lady' put at the end.

5 <span id="fr_780"></span>[5](#fn_779). (He should beg.md) from three
women who will not refuse;

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

6\. From six, twelve, or an indefinite number.

7\. From his own mother first, according to some (teachers).

8 <span id="fr_781"></span>[8](#fn_780.md). Having announced the alms
received to his teacher, he should stand, keeping silence, through the
rest of the day, according to some.

9 <span id="fr_782"></span>[9](#fn_781.md). Having fetched fire-wood out of
the forest without damaging (trees), he should put them on that fire as
above, and should abandon his silence.

10\. He should sleep on the ground and eat no pungent or saline food.

11\. Wearing the staff, worshipping the fire, being obedient to his
Guru, going the rounds for alms—(these are the standing duties of
students).

12 <span id="fr_783"></span>[12](#fn_782.md). He should avoid honey or
flesh, bathing (for pleasure), sitting on high seats, going to women,
falsehood, and taking what is not given to him.

13 <span id="fr_784"></span>[13-15](#fn_783.md). Let him live forty-eight
years as a student for the (four) Vedas,

14\. Or twelve years for each Veda,

15\. Or until he has learnt it.

16\. The garment (of a student) should be made of hemp, flax, or wool
(accordingly as he is a Brâhma*n*a, a Kshatriya, or a Vai*s*ya).

17\. The upper garment of a Brâhma*n*a should be an antelope-skin,

18\. That of a Râ*g*anya the skin of a spotted deer,

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

19\. That of a Vai*s*ya a goat's or cow's skin.

20\. Or if (the prescribed sort of garment) is not to be had, a cow's
hide (should be worn) by all, because to that belongs the first place
(among all kinds of garments).

21\. The girdle of a Brâhma*n*a should be of Mu*ñg*a grass,

22\. That of a Kshatriya should be a bowstring,

23\. That of a Vai*s*ya, made of Mûrvâ (i.e. Sanseveria Roxburghiana).

24 <span id="fr_785"></span>[24](#fn_784.md). If there is no Mu*ñg*a (or
the other articles prescribed in §§ 22, 23, the girdles should be made)
of Ku*s*a grass, of the plant A*s*mantaka, or of Balba*g*a grass
(respectively).

25\. The staff of a Brâhma*n*a is of Palâ*s*a wood,

26\. That of a Râ*g*anya of Bilva wood,

27\. That of a Vai*s*ya of Udumbara wood.

28\. Or all (sorts of staffs may be used) by all.

29\. If the teacher calls him, he shall rise and then answer..

30\. If (the teacher calls him) while he is lying down, (he should
answer) sitting; if sitting, standing; if standing, walking up (to the
teacher); if walking up, running up.

31\. If he behaves thus, his fame when he has become a Snâtaka (i.e.
when he has taken the bath at the end of his studentship) will be (such
that people will say of him), 'To-day he stays there; to-day he stays
there.'

32 <span id="fr_786"></span>[32-35](#fn_785). There are three (kinds of.md)
Snâtakas: a Vidyâ-snâtaka (i.e. a Snâtaka by knowledge), a Vrata-snâtaka

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (i.e. a Snâtaka by
the completion of his vows), and a Vidyâ-vrata-snâtaka (i.e. a Snâtaka
both by knowledge and by the completion of his vows).

33\. He who performs the Samâvartana ceremony, after having finished the
study of the Veda, but before the time of his vows has expired, is a
Vidyâ-snâtaka.

34\. He who performs the Samâvartana, after his vows have expired, but
before he has finished the study of the Veda, is a Vrata-snâtaka.

35\. He who performs the Samâvartana, after having finished both, is a
Vidyâ-vrata-snâtaka.

36 <span id="fr_787"></span>[36-40](#fn_786.md). Until the sixteenth year
the time (for being initiated) has not passed for a Brâhma*n*a,

37\. Until the twenty-second for a Râ*g*anya,

38\. Until the twenty-fourth for a Vai*s*ya.

39\. After that (time has passed), they become patitasâvitrîka (or
persons who have lost the right of learning the Sâvitrî).

40\. No one should initiate such men, nor teach them, nor perform
sacrifices for them, nor have intercourse with them.

41 <span id="fr_788"></span>[41](#fn_787.md). After the time has passed,
(they should do) as has been prescribed.

42 <span id="fr_789"></span>[42](#fn_788.md). A person whose ancestors
through three generations have been patitasâvitrîkas, is excluded

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

from the sacrament (of initiation) and from being taught the Veda.

43 <span id="fr_790"></span>[43](#fn_789.md). Of such persons those who
desire to receive the sacrament, may perform the sacrifice of
Vrâtyastoma and then study the Veda, if they like. For (of persons who
have done that) it is said, 'Intercourse with them is permitted.'

Âpastamba I, 30, 1-3; Manu IV, 31. The term of the vows extends through
forty-eight (or thirty-six, &c.) <span id="page_311">p. 311</span>
years; see above, Sûtras 13 and 14, and below, chap. 6, 2. 3. The
Samâvartana is the returning home of the student at the end of his
studentship.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[311:41](sbe29178.htm#fr_788.md) The general rule
here alluded to is, according to the commentators, that given by
Kâtyâyana, *S*rauta-sûtra XXV, 1, 12. 13. There it is stated which
expiatory oblations have to precede, when a rite that has not been
performed, or that has been incorrectly performed, is to be performed
for good.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[311:42](sbe29178.htm#fr_789.md) Those who have
not been initiated in due time, may act as <span id="page_312">p.
312</span> stated in Sûtra 41. But if the omission has been perpetuated
through three generations, the descendant of such persons is subject to
the rules stated in Sûtras 42 and 43.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[312:43](sbe29178.htm#fr_790.md) Kâtyâyana, after
having given the rules on the Vrâtyastoma sacrifice (see Weber, Indische
Literaturgeschichte, 2nd edition, pp. 73 seq.), says: 'Intercourse with
them (who have performed that sacrifice) is permitted' (*S*raut. XXII,
4, 28).
