Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 14.

1 <span id="fr_839"></span>[1](#fn_838). Now (follows.md) the *S*rava*n*a
ceremony,

2\. On the full-moon day of the *S*râva*n*a month.

3\. He cooks a mess of sacrificial food, fried grains, and a cake in one
dish, pounds the greater part of the grains, sacrifices the two Â*g*ya
portions, and two (other) Â*g*ya oblations (with the following verses):

4 <span id="fr_840"></span>[4](#fn_839.md). 'Beat away, O white one, with
thy foot, with the fore-foot and with the hind-foot, these seven
\[children\] of Varu*n*a and all (daughters) of the king's tribe.
Svâhâ!'

5 <span id="fr_841"></span>[5](#fn_840.md). 'Within the dominion of the
white one, the Serpent has seen nobody. To the white one, the son of
Vidarva, adoration! Svâhâ!'

6\. He makes oblations of the mess of cooked sacrificial food to
Vish*n*u, to *S*rava*n*a, to the full moon of *S*râva*n*a, and to the
rainy season,

7\. (And oblations) of the grains with (the verse), 'Accompanied with
grains' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XX, 29).

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

8\. He sacrifices flour, over which ghee has been poured, to the
serpents (with the following Mantras):

9\. 'To the lord of the serpents belonging to Agni, of the yellowish,
terrestrial ones, svâhâ!

'To the lord of the white serpents belonging to Vâyu, of the aerial
ones, svâhâ!

'To the lord of the overpowering serpents belonging to Sûrya, of the
celestial ones, svâhâ!

10\. The (cake) in one dish he offers entirely (without leaving a
remainder for the sacrificer) with (the formula), 'To the firm one, the
son of the Earth, svâhâ!'

11 <span id="fr_842"></span>[11](#fn_841.md). After he has eaten (of the
sacrificial food), he throws a portion of the flour into a basket, goes
out, besmears an elevated spot outside the hall (with cowdung), says,
while a fire-brand is held (before him), 'Do not step between (myself
and the fire),' and without speaking (anything except the Mantras), he
causes the serpents to wash themselves, (pouring out water for them,
with the formulas:)

12\. 'Lord of the serpents belonging to Agni, of the yellowish,
terrestrial ones, wash thyself!

'Lord of the white serpents belonging to Vâyu, of the aerial ones, wash
thyself!

'Lord of the overpowering serpents belonging to Sûrya, of the celestial
ones, wash thyself!'

13 <span id="fr_843"></span>[13](#fn_842.md). Each time after the washing
has been done, he offers to the serpents a Bali of flour, picking out

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (portions of it)
with (the spoon called) Darvî (with the formulas):

14\. 'Lord of the serpents belonging to Agni, of the yellowish,
terrestrial ones, this is thy Bali!

'Lord of the white serpents belonging to Vâyu, of the aerial ones, this
is thy Bali!

'Lord of the overpowering serpents belonging to Sûrya, of the celestial
ones, this is thy Bali!'

15 <span id="fr_844"></span>[15](#fn_843.md). After he has made them wash
themselves as above, he combs them with combs (with the formulas)

16\. 'Lord of the serpents belonging to Agni, of the yellowish,
terrestrial ones, comb thyself!

'Lord of the white serpents belonging to Vâyu, of the aerial ones, comb
thyself!

'Lord of the overpowering serpents belonging to Sûrya, of the celestial
ones, comb thyself!'

17\. (He offers) collyrium, ointment, and garlands with (the same
formulas), putting at their end, respectively, the words, 'Salve thy
eyes!' 'Anoint thyself!' 'Put on garlands!'

18\. The remainder of the flour he pours out on the elevated spot
(mentioned in Sûtra 11), pours water on it out of a water-pot, and
worships the

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

serpents with the three (verses), 'Adoration be to the serpents' (Vâ*g*.
Sa*m*h. XIII, 6 seqq.).

19\. At that distance in which he wishes the serpents not to approach
(the house), he should three times walk round the house, sprinkling an
uninterrupted stream of water round it, with the two (verses), 'Beat
away, O white one, with thy foot' (Sûtras 4 and 5).

20\. He gives away the (spoon called) Darvî (Sûtra 13) and the basket
(Sûtra 11), having washed and warmed them.

21\. Near the door (of the house) they clean themselves with the three
(verses), 'O waters, ye are' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XI, 50 seqq.).

22 <span id="fr_845"></span>[22](#fn_844.md). Having put away that
remainder of flour in a hidden place, he should from that time daily
till the Âgrahâya*n*î, after sunset, when he has performed the service
to the fire, offer to the serpents a Bali of flour, picking out
(portions of it) with the Darvî (spoon).

23 <span id="fr_846"></span>[23](#fn_845.md). When he is offering (the
Bali), let no one step between (the sacrificer and the Bali).

24 <span id="fr_847"></span>[24](#fn_846). With the Darvî (spoon.md) he
rinses his mouth. Having washed it, he puts it away.

20\. According to the commentators he gives these things to the man who
holds the fire-brand (Sûtra 11).

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

25 <span id="fr_848"></span>[25](#fn_847). They eat the (rice.md) grains
which must not form one coherent mass.

26\. Then (follows) the feeding of the Brâhma*n*as.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_838"></span>[327:1](sbe29187.htm#fr_839.md) 14, 1 seqq. Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana IV, 5; Â*s*valâyana II, 1; Gobhila III, 7.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[327:4](sbe29187.htm#fr_840.md) Â*s*valâyana II,
3, 3; *S*âṅkhâyana IV, 18, 1. For Vâru*n*ai*h* and râ*g*abândhavai*h* I
read Vâru*n*î*h*, râ*g*abândhavî*h*. Pra*g*â*h* is an interpolation.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[327:5](sbe29187.htm#fr_841.md) Â*s*valâyana, loc.
cit. One is rather tempted to correct ahir dada*ms*a ka*ñk*ana, but
Râma*k*andra's Paddhati on *S*âṅkhâyana gives the reading dadar*s*a, as
the Pâraskara MSS. do.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[328:11](sbe29187.htm#fr_842.md) The ceremony with
the fire-brand seems to stand in connection with the rule given by
Â*s*valâyana, II, 1, 13, that before the sacrificer has given himself in
charge' to the serpents, nobody is allowed to step between him and the
Bali destined for the serpents. Comp. also below, Sûtra 23.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[328:13](sbe29187.htm#fr_843.md) I have translated
upaghâtam by 'picking out.' On the full <span id="page_329">p.
329</span> technical meaning of the term, which implies the omission of
the upastara*n*a and abhighâra*n*a, see Bloomfield's note on
G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha I, 111 (Zeitschrift der deutschen Morgenländischen
Gesellschaft, XXXV, 568).

<span id="fn_843"></span>[329:15](sbe29187.htm#fr_844.md) The words as
above refer to Sûtra 11. Pralikhati, which I have translated 'he combs
them,' is the same act for which Sâṅkhâyana (IV, 15, 7) says, pha*n*ena
*k*esh*t*ayati. I think Professor Stenzler is wrong in translating: Er
scharrt (das Mehl) mit Kämmen zusammen. *G*ayarâma says: pralekhana*m*
*k*a krame*n*a pratimantram balika*nd*ûyana*m* kaṅkatai*h*. tâni *k*a
vaikaṅkatîyâni prâde*s*amâtrâ*n*y ekatodantâni kâsh*th*âni bhavanti.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[330:22](sbe29187.htm#fr_845.md) The Âgrahâya*n*î
is the full-moon day of Mârga*s*îrsha, on which the Pratyavaroha*n*a
ceremony is celebrated. See below, III, 2; Weber, die vedischen
Nachrichten von den Naxatra, II, 332. The expression darvyopaghâta*m* is
the same that has occurred above in Sûtra 13.

<span id="fn_845"></span>[330:23](sbe29187.htm#fr_846.md) Comp.
Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya II, 1, 13, and see above, Sûtra 11.

<span id="fn_846"></span>[330:24](sbe29187.htm#fr_847.md) Prakshâlya seems
to me to refer to the Darvî; see Sûtra 20.

<span id="fn_847"></span>[331:25](sbe29187.htm#fr_848.md) Asa*m*syûtâ*h*.
Comp. Böhtlingk-Roth s*v*. sa*m*-sîv.
