*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 20.

1\. Or all (sorts of staffs are to be used) by (men of) all (castes).

2 <span id="fr_456"></span>[2](#fn_455). While (the student) takes hold
of him, the teacher sacrifices and then stations himself to the north of
the fire, with his face turned to the east.

3\. To the east (of the fire) with his face to the west the other one.

4\. (The teacher then) fills the two hollows of (his own and the
student's) joined hands with water, and with the verse, 'That we choose
of Savit*ri*' (Rig-veda V, 82, 1) he makes with the full (hollow of his
own hands the water) flow down on the full (hollow of) his, (i.e. the
student's hands.) Having (thus) poured (the water over his hands) he
should with his (own) hand seize his (i.e. the student's) hand together
with the thumb, with (the formula), 'By the impulse of the god
Savit*ri*, with the arms of the two A*s*vins, with Pûshan's hands I
seize thy hand, N.N.!'

5\. With (the words), 'Savit*ri* has seized thy hand, N.N.!' a second
time.

6\. With (the words), 'Agni is thy teacher, N.N.!' a third time.

7\. He should cause him to look at the sun while the teacher says, 'God
Savit*ri*, this is thy Brahma*k*ârin; protect him; may he not die.'

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

8\. (And further the teacher says), 'Whose Brahma*k*ârin art thou? The
breath's Brahma*k*ârin art thou. Who does initiate thee, and whom (does
he initiate)? To whom shall I give thee in charge?'

9\. With the half verse, 'A youth, well attired, dressed came hither'
(Rig-veda III, 8, 4) he should cause him to turn round from the left to
the right.

10\. Reaching with his two hands over his (i.e. the student's) shoulders
(the teacher) should touch the place of his heart with the following
(half verse).

11 <span id="fr_457"></span>[11](#fn_456). Having wiped the ground round
the fire, the student should put on a piece of wood silently. 'Silence
indeed is what belongs to Pra*g*âpati. The student becomes belonging to
Pra*g*âpati'—this is understood (in the *S*ruti).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_455"></span>[188:2](sbe29119.htm#fr_456) 20, 2. He offers
the oblations prescribed above, chap. 1, 4, 3 seq.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[189:11](sbe29119.htm#fr_457) On the wiping of
the ground round the fire, comp. above, chap. 3, 1;
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 7, 11. Nârâya*n*a here has the following
remarks, which I can scarcely believe to express the real meaning of
this Sûtra: 'Here the wiping of the ground round the fire is out of
place, because the Sa*m*skâras for the fire have already been performed.
As to that, it should be observed that the wiping is mentioned here in
order that, when fuel is put on the fire in the evening and in the
morning, the sprinkling of water and the wiping may be performed. But on
this occasion (at the Upanayana) the student does not perform the
wiping, &c., and silently puts a piece of wood on that fire.'
