------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 10.

1 <span id="fr_522"></span>[1](#fn_521.md). It has been declared how he
should enter the house (when returning from a journey).

2\. The house, when he enters it, should be provided with seed-corn.

3 <span id="fr_523"></span>[3](#fn_522.md). He should have his field
ploughed under the Nakshatras Uttarâ*h* Prosh*th*apadâs, (Uttarâ*h*)
Phâlgunyas, or Rohi*n*î.

4\. In order that the wind may blow to him from the field, he should
offer oblations with the hymn, 'Through the lord of the field' (Rig-veda
IV, 57), verse by verse, or he should murmur (that hymn).

5 <span id="fr_524"></span>[5](#fn_523.md). He should speak over the cows
when they go away, the two verses, 'May refreshing wind blow over the
cows' (Rig-veda X, 169, I seq.).

6 <span id="fr_525"></span>[6](#fn_524.md). When they come back, (he should
recite the following verses,)

'May they whose udder with its four holes is full

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

of honey and ghee, be milk-givers to us; (may they be) many in our
stable, rich in ghee.

'Come hither to me, giving refreshment, bringing vigour and strength.
Giving inexhaustible milk, rest in my stable that I may become the
highest one'

And, 'They who have raised their body up to the gods'—the rest of the
hymn (Rig-veda X, 169, 3. 4).

7 <span id="fr_526"></span>[7](#fn_525.md). Some recite (instead of the
texts stated in Sûtra 6) the Âgâvîya hymn.

8 <span id="fr_527"></span>[8](#fn_526.md). He should approach their herds,
if the cows do not belong to his Guru, with (the words), 'Prospering are
ye; excellent are ye, beautiful, dear. May I become dear to you. May you
see bliss in me.'

End of the Second Adhyâya.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_521"></span>[215:1](sbe29133.htm#fr_522.md) 10, 1. See
*S*rauta-sûtra II, 5, 17 seqq. It is there expressly stated that these
rules refer also to an Anâhitâgni.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[215:3](sbe29133.htm#fr_523.md) *S*âṅkhâyana IV,
13, 1.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[215:5](sbe29133.htm#fr_524.md)
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya III, 9.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[215:6](sbe29133.htm#fr_525.md) *S*âṅkhâyana, loc.
cit.—Should the reading upa maitu be corrected into upa maita?

<span id="fn_525"></span>[216:7](sbe29133.htm#fr_526.md) The hymn
commencing â gâvo agman (hither came the cows) is Rig-veda VI, 28.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[216:8](sbe29133.htm#fr_527.md) Perhaps the last
words (which are repeated twice in order to mark the end of the Adhyâya)
should be written sa*m* mayi *g*ânîdhvam, 'live with me in harmony
together.'
