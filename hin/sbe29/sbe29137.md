'Pra*g*âpati, Brahman, the Vedas, the gods, the *Ri*shis, all metres,
the word Om, the word Vasha*t*, the Vyâh*ri*tis, the Sâvitrî, the
sacrifices, Heaven and Earth, the air, days and nights, the numbers, the
Siddhas, the oceans, the rivers, the mountains, the fields, herbs,
trees, Gandharvas and Apsaras, the snakes, the birds, the cows, the
Sâdhyas, the Vipras, the Yakshas, the Rakshas, the beings that have
these (Rakshas, &c.) at their end.'

2 <span id="fr_531"></span>[2](#fn_530). Then the *Ri*shis: 'The
(*Ri*shis) of the hundred (*Rik*as), the (*Ri*shis) of the middle
(Ma*nd*alas), G*ri*tsamada,

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vi*s*vâmitra,
Vâmadeva, Atri, Bharadvâ*g*a, Vasish*th*a, the Pragâthas, the Pavamâna
hymns, the (*Ri*shis) of the short hymns, and of the long hymns.'

3\. (Then) with the sacrificial cord suspended over the right shoulder:

4 <span id="fr_532"></span>[4](#fn_531). 'Sumantu, *G*aimini,
Vai*s*ampâyana, Paila, the Sûtras, the Bhâshyas, the Bhârata, the
Mahâbhârata, the teachers of law, *G*ânanti, Bâhavi, Gârgya, Gautama,
*S*âkalya, Bâbhravya, Mâ*nd*avya, Mâ*nd*ûkeya, Gârgî Vâ*k*aknavî,
Va*d*avâ Prâtîtheyî, Sulabhâ Maitreyî, Kahola Kaushîtaka,
Mahâkaushîtaka, Paiṅgya, Mahâpaiṅgya, Suya*gñ*a *S*âṅkhâyana, Aitareya,
Mahaitareya, the *S*âkala (text), the Bâshkala (text), Su*g*âtavaktra,
Audavâhi, Mahaudavâhi, Sau*g*âmi, *S*aunaka, Â*s*valâyana—and whatsoever
other teachers there are, may they all satiate themselves.'

5 <span id="fr_533"></span>[5](#fn_532). After he has satiated the
Fathers man by man, and has returned to his house, what he gives (then),
that is the sacrificial fee.

6 <span id="fr_534"></span>[6](#fn_533). And it is also understood (in
the *S*ruti), 'May he be standing, walking, sitting, or lying, (the
texts belonging to) whatsoever sacrifice he repeats, that sacrifice
indeed he has offered.'

7\. It is understood (in the *S*ruti), 'Regarding this (Svâdhyâya) there
are two cases in which the study (of the sacred texts) is forbidden:
when he is impure himself, and when the place is.'
