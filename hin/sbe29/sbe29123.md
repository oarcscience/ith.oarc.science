### KA*ND*IKÂ 24.

1 <span id="fr_481"></span>[1](#fn_480.md). When he has chosen the
*Ri*tvi*g*as, he should offer the Madhuparka (i.e. honey-mixture) to
them (in the way described in Sûtras 5 and following);

2\. To a Snâtaka, when he comes to his house;

3\. And to a king;

4\. And for a teacher, the father-in-law, a paternal uncle, and a
maternal uncle.

5\. He pours honey into curds,

6\. Or butter, if he can get no honey.

7\. A seat, the water for washing the feet, the Arghya water (i.e.
perfumed water into which flowers have been thrown), the water for
sipping, the honey-mixture,

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

a cow: every one of these things they announce three times (to the
guest).

8\. With (the verse), 'I am the highest one among my people, as the sun
among the thunderbolts. Here I tread on him whosoever infests me'—he
should sit down on the seat (made of) northward-pointed (grass).

9\. Or (he should do so) after he has trodden on it.

10\. He should make (his host) wash his feet.

11\. The right foot he should stretch out first to a Brâhma*n*a,

12\. The left to a *S*ûdra.

13\. When his feet have been washed, he receives the Arghya water in the
hollow of his joined hands and then sips the water destined thereto,
with (the formula), 'Thou art the first layer for Ambrosia.'

14\. He looks at the Madhuparka when it is brought to him, with (the
formula), 'I look at thee with Mitra's eye.'

15\. He accepts it with his joined hands with (the formula), 'By the
impulse of the god Sâvitrî, with the arms of the two A*s*vins, with the
hands of Pûshan I accept thee.' He then takes it into his left hand,
looks at it with the three verses, 'Honey the winds to the righteous
one' (Rig-veda I, 90, 6 seqq.), stirs it about three times from left to
right with the fourth finger and the thumb, and wipes (his fingers) with
(the formula), 'May the Vasus eat thee with the Gâyatrî metre'—to the
east;

16\. With (the formula), 'May the Rudras eat thee with the Trish*t*ubh
metre'—to the south;

17\. With (the formula), 'May the Âdityas eat thee with the *G*agatî
metre'—to the west;

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

18\. With (the formula), 'May the Vi*s*ve devâs eat thee with the
Anush*t*ubh metre'—to the north.

19\. With (the formula), 'To the beings thee'—he three times takes (some
of the Madhuparka substance) out of the middle of it.

20\. With (the formula), 'The milk of Virâ*g* art thou'—he should
partake thereof the first time,

21\. With, 'The milk of Virâ*g* may I obtain'—the second time,

22 <span id="fr_482"></span>[22](#fn_481). With, 'In me (may.md) the milk
of Padyâ Virâ*g* (dwell)'—the third time.

23\. (He should) not (eat) the whole (Madhuparka).

24\. He should not satiate himself.

25\. To a Brâhma*n*a, to the north, he should give the remainder.

26\. If that cannot be done, (he should throw it) into water.

27\. Or (he may eat) the whole (Madhuparka).

28 <span id="fr_483"></span>[28](#fn_482.md). He then makes a rinsing of
his mouth follow (on the eating of the Madhuparka) with the water
destined thereto, with (the formula), 'Thou art the covering of
Ambrosia.'

29\. With (the formula), 'Truth! Glory! Fortune! May fortune rest on
me!'—a second time.

30\. When he has sipped water, they announce to him the cow.

31\. Having murmured, 'Destroyed is my sin; my sin is destroyed,' (he
says,) 'Om, do it,' if he chooses to have her killed.

32\. Having murmured, 'The mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the
Vasus' (Rig-veda VIII, 101, 15),

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (he says,) 'Om,
let her loose,' if he chooses to let her loose.

33 <span id="fr_484"></span>[33](#fn_483.md). Let the Madhuparka not be
without flesh, without flesh.

End of the First Adhyâya.
