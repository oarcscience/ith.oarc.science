*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 8.

1\. Now he should examine the ground in the following ways.

2\. He should dig a pit knee-deep and fill it again with the same earth
(which he has taken out of it).

3\. If (the earth) reaches out (of the pit, the ground is) excellent; if
it is level, (it is) of middle quality; if it does not fill (the pit, it
is) to be rejected.

4\. After sunset he should fill (the pit) with water and leave it so
through the night.

5\. If (in the morning) there is water in it, (the ground is) excellent;
if it is moist, (it is) of middle quality; if it is dry, (it is) to be
rejected.

6\. White (ground), of sweet taste, with sand on the surface, (should be
elected) by a Brâhma*n*a.

7\. Red (ground) for a Kshatriya.

8\. Yellow (ground) for a Vai*s*ya.

9\. He should draw a thousand furrows on it and should have it measured
off as quadrangular, with equal sides to each (of the four) directions;

10\. Or as an oblong quadrangle.

11 <span id="fr_513"></span>[11](#fn_512.md). With a *S*amî branch or an
Udumbara branch he sprinkles it (with water), going thrice round it, so
that his right side is turned towards it, reciting the *S*antâtîya hymn.

12\. And (so he does again three times) pouring out water without
interruption, with the three verses, 'O waters, ye are wholesome'
(Rig-veda X, 9, 1 seqq.).

13 <span id="fr_514"></span>[13](#fn_513.md). In the interstices between
the bamboo staffs he should have the (single) rooms constructed.

14\. Into the pits in which the posts are to stand, he should have an
Avakâ, i.e. (the water-plant called) *S*îpâla put down; then fire will
not befall him: thus it is understood (in the *S*ruti).

15 <span id="fr_515"></span>[15](#fn_514). Having put (that plant.md) into
the pit in which the middle-post is to stand, he should spread (on it)
eastward-pointed and northward-pointed Ku*s*a grass and should sprinkle
(on that grass) water into which rice and barley have been thrown, with
(the words), 'To the steady one, the earth-demon, svâhâ!'

16 <span id="fr_516"></span>[16](#fn_515.md). He then should, when (the
middle-post) is being erected, recite over it (the two verses), 'Stand
here, fixed in the ground, prosperous, long-lasting (?),

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

standing amid prosperity. May the malevolent ones not attain thee!

'To thee (may) the young child (come), to thee the calf . . .; to thee
(may) the cup of Parisrut (come); (to thee) may they come with pots of
curds.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_512"></span>[213:11](sbe29131.htm#fr_513.md) 8, 11. The hymn
of which all verses (except a few) commence with, and frequently
contain, the word *s*am (Rig-veda VII, 35).

<span id="fn_513"></span>[213:13](sbe29131.htm#fr_514.md) The bamboo staffs
(va*ms*a) rest on the chief posts (sthû*n*â); see chap. 9, 1. 2.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[213:15](sbe29131.htm#fr_515.md) Comp. chap. 1, 4.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[213:16](sbe29131.htm#fr_516.md) Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya III, 3, 1 and the note there. How stâmirâvatîm
should be corrected and translated is quite uncertain. Instead of
poshasva Prof. Stenzler proposes to read poshasya, as *S*âṅkhâyana has;
I have adopted this correction.—In the second verse *g*âyatâ*m* saha
seems to be corrupt; comp. my note on *S*âṅkhâyana III, 2, 9. Instead of
pari*s*rita*h* we should read, as *S*âṅkhâyana, Pâraskara, and the
Atharva-veda (III, 12, 7) have, parisruta*h*.
