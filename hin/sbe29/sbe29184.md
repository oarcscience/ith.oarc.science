*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 11.

1 <span id="fr_828"></span>[1](#fn_827). If (a strong) wind is blowing,
and on the new-moon day there is an entire interruption of study.

2\. If one has partaken of a *S*râddha dinner, if a meteor falls, or
distant thundering is heard, or if the earth quakes, or if fiery
apparitions are seen, and when a new season begins, (the study shall be
interrupted) until the same time next day.

3 <span id="fr_829"></span>[3](#fn_828). If the Utsarga ceremony has
been performed,

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

if clouds appear, . . . ., (it shall be interrupted) through a period of
three nights or till twilight has thrice passed.

4 <span id="fr_830"></span>[4](#fn_829). After he has eaten, until he
has (washed and) dried his hands; while being in water; at nighttime; at
the time of the morning and evening twilight; while a dead body or a
*K*a*nd*âla is in the village.

5\. While running, while seeing a person of bad fame or who has lost his
caste, if a miraculous or happy event happens, as long as (that which
occasions the interruption of study) endures.

6\. If hoar-frost (lies on the ground), if a musical instrument is
heard, or the cry of a person in pain, at the border of the village, in
a burial ground, or if a dog, an ass, an owl, a jackal, or a Sâman song
is heard, or if a learned person approaches, as long as (that occasion)
endures.

7\. If his Guru has died, let him go down into water (for offering
water-oblations) and interrupt (the study) for ten nights.

8 <span id="fr_831"></span>[8](#fn_830). If one who has performed with
him the Tânûnaptra ceremony, or a fellow-pupil (has died), for three
nights.

9\. If one who is not his fellow-pupil, (has died,) for one night.

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

10\. After having studied five months and a half, they should celebrate
the Utsarga,

11\. Or six months and a half.

12 <span id="fr_832"></span>[12](#fn_831). They then mutter this *Rik*:
'Ye two young sages! The relation which has expired among us, the
friendship we dissolve, (turning away) from the condition of
friendship.'

13\. After having remained together through a period of three nights,
they separate.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_827"></span>[323:1](sbe29184.htm#fr_828) 11, 1. 'Entire
interruption' means, according to the commentators, that not only the
study of the Veda itself, but also that of the Vedâṅgas, or even all
sorts of worldly instruction are forbidden.

<span id="fn_828"></span>[323:3](sbe29184.htm#fr_829) I have left the
words sarvarûpe *k*a untranslated. Evidently <span id="page_324">p.
324</span> sarvarûpa is identical with the doubtful word *s*avarûpa
which twice occurs in the *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya. See the discussion on
that word in the note on *S*âṅkhâyana II, 12, 10.

<span id="fn_829"></span>[324:4](sbe29184.htm#fr_830) On
antardivâkîrtye, comp. Manu V, 85. Gautama XVI, 19.

<span id="fn_830"></span>[324:8](sbe29184.htm#fr_831) The Tânûnaptra is
an invocation directed to Tanûnapt*ri* (i.e. the wind) by which the
officiating priests and the Ya*g*amâna at a Soma sacrifice pledge their
faith to do no harm to each other. See Indische Studien, X, 362.

<span id="fn_831"></span>[325:12](sbe29184.htm#fr_832) The reading of
the Mantra is doubtful. I think it should stand as Professor Stenzler
has printed it, except that I should propose to correct yuvâ into yuvânâ
(comp. Â*s*valâyana-*S*rauta VI, 12, 12). It is probable that the gods
addressed are the two A*s*vins, who are called kavî and yuvânâ in
several passages of the Vedas.
