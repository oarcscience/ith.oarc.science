<span id="fn_30"></span>[19:1](sbe29006.htm#fr_31.md) 4, 1. The Paddhati of
Râma*k*andra understands svâdhyâyam adhîyîta as a prescription to
perform the daily Brahmaya*gñ*a (comp., for instance,
Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya III, 2; Âpastamba I, 11, 22 seq.), which consists
in the recitation of portions of the Veda; the hymns and verses stated
in Sûtra 2 are, according to the same authority, to be repeated
immediately after the recitation of the svâdhyâya ('svâdhyâyânantaram').
Nârâya*n*a, on the contrary, considers that the svâdhyâya prescribed in
Sûtra 1 consists of those very hymns and verses which are indicated in
the second Sûtra. As to the Brahmaya*gñ*a, he says that the *k*a at the
end of the second Sûtra may be referred to it ('the word *k*a means that
texts procuring a long life, such as Rig-veda I, 89, should be murmured,
or an injunction of the Brahmaya*gñ*a is intended'). At all events it is
very difficult to believe that the recitation of the texts stated in
this chapter should be quite independent from the daily Brahmaya*gñ*a.
About the performance of the Brahmaya*gñ*a in our days comp. the note of
Professor Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, vol. ii, p. 43.
