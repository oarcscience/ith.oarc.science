Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 7.

1\. If the sun sets while he is sleeping without being sick, he should
spend the rest of the night keeping silence, without sitting down, and
should worship the sun (when it rises) with the five (verses), 'The
light, O sun, by which thou destroyest darkness' (Rig-veda X, 37, 4
seq.).

2 <span id="fr_548"></span>[2](#fn_547). If (the sun) rises (while he is
sleeping without being sick), being fatigued without having done any
work, or having done work that is not becoming, he should keep silence,
&c., as before, and perform his worship (to the sun) with the following
four (verses, Rig-veda X, 37, 9 seq.).

3 <span id="fr_549"></span>[3](#fn_548). Invested with the sacrificial
cord, constantly fulfilling the prescribed duties regarding the use of

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

water, he should perform the Sandhyâ (or twilight devotion), observing
silence.

4\. In the evening he should, turning his face to the north-west, to the
region between the chief (west) point and the intermediate
(north-western) point (of the horizon), murmur the Sâvitrî, (beginning)
when the sun is half set, until the stars appear.

5\. In the same way in the morning—

6\. Standing, with his face turned to the east, until the disk (of the
sun) appears.

7\. If a dove flies against his house or towards it, he should sacrifice
with (the hymn), 'O gods, the dove' (Rig-veda X, 165), verse by verse,
or should murmur (that hymn).

8\. 'We have thee, O Lord of the path' (Rig-veda VI, 53)—if he is going
out for doing some business.

9 <span id="fr_550"></span>[9](#fn_549). 'Bring us together, Pûshan,
with a knowing one' (Rig-Veda VI, 54)—if he wishes to find something
lost, or if he has strayed.

10\. 'Journey over the ways, Pûshan' (Rig-veda I, 42)—if he is going out
on a long or dangerous way.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_547"></span>[225:2](sbe29140.htm#fr_548) 7, 2. Perhaps we
should correct the text, akarma*s*rântam anabhirûpe*n*a karma*n*â vâ
vâgyata iti, &c.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[225:3](sbe29140.htm#fr_549) 3 seq. See
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya II, 9. There the same word anvash*t*amade*s*a
occurs.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[226:9](sbe29140.htm#fr_550) Mû*lh*a may either
mean, 'having lost his way,' or 'bewildered in his mind.' Nârâya*n*a
prefers the latter explanation ('pra*gñ*âhîna*h*').
