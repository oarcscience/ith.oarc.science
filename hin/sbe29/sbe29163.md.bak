### KA*ND*IKÂ 9.

1 <span id="fr_720"></span>[1](#fn_719.md). Beginning from the wedding the
worshipping of the Aupâsana (i.e. sacred domestic) fire (is prescribed).

2 <span id="fr_721"></span>[2](#fn_720.md). After sunset and before sunrise
(the fire should

be worshipped) with (oblations of) curds, (rice) grains, or fried
grains.

3\. (He sacrifices) in the evening with (the formulas), 'To Agni svâhâ!
To Pra*g*âpati svâhâ!'

4\. In the morning with (the formulas), 'To Sûrya svâhâ! To Pra*g*âpati
svâhâ!'

5 <span id="fr_722"></span>[5](#fn_721.md). 'Men are both Mitra and
Varu*n*a; men are both the A*s*vins; men are Indra and Sûrya. May a man
be born in me! Again svâhâ!'—with (this verse) a wife who desires to
conceive, (should offer) the first (oblation).

<span id="fn_719"></span>[286:1](sbe29163.htm#fr_720.md) 9, 1. The
expression which I have translated 'beginning from the wedding' is
upayamanaprabh*ri*ti. The Indian commentators and Professor Stenzler
explain the term upayamana as implying a reference to the Sûtra I, 1, 4,
upayamanân ku*s*ân âdâya ('having taken up the Ku*s*a blades with which
he is to take hold of the lower surface of the Â*g*ya pot'). 'The
worshipping of the domestic fire,' says Stenzler, following the native
authorities, 'consists in the rites which have been prescribed above (I,
1, 4), beginning from the word upayamana, i.e. in the taking up of the
Ku*s*a blades, the putting of wood on the fire, the sprinkling and
sacrificing. As the rites preceding that word, such as the preparation
of the sacrificial spoon (I, 1, 3), are hereby excluded, the oblations
are offered with the hand.' It would be easy to show that the
upayamanâ*h* ku*s*â*h* have nothing at all to do with the regular
morning and evening oblations of which these Sûtras treat. The
comparison of Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I, 9, 1 (see also Manu III, 67, &c.)
leaves no doubt that upayamana is to be understood here as derived from
upaya*kkh*ati in its very frequent meaning of marrying. I have
translated the Sûtra accordingly.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[286:2](sbe29163.htm#fr_721.md) On the different
statements of Vedic authors with regard to the proper time of the
morning oblations, see Weber's Indische Studien, X, 329.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[287:5](sbe29163.htm#fr_722.md) Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 17, 9, where the reading and the construction
slightly differ. The words puna*h* svâhâ at the end of the Mantra seem
to be corrupt; the frequent repetition of pumâ*m*sam and pumân through
the whole verse suggests the correction pu*m*se svâhâ, or pumbhya*h*
svâhâ, 'to the man svâhâ!' or 'to the men svâhâ!'
