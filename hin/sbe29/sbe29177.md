### KA*ND*IKÂ 4.

1\. Now the putting on of fuel.

2 <span id="fr_776"></span>[2](#fn_775). He wipes with his hand (the
ground) round the fire with (the formula), 'Agni, glorious one, make me
glorious. As thou, glorious Agni, art glorious, thus, O glorious one,
bring me to glory. As thou, Agni, art the preserver of the treasure of
sacrifice for the gods, thus may I become the preserver of the treasure
of the Veda for men.'

3 <span id="fr_777"></span>[3](#fn_776). Having sprinkled (water) round
the fire from left to right, he stands up and puts a piece of wood on
(the fire) with (the texts),

'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood, to the great *G*âtavedas. As
thou, Agni, art inflamed by wood, thus I am inflamed by life, insight,
vigour, offspring, cattle, holy lustre.

'May my teacher be the father of living sons; may I be full of insight,
not forgetful (of what I have learned); may I become full of glory, of
splendour, of holy lustre, an enjoyer of food. Svâhâ!

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

4\. In the same way (he puts on) a second (piece of wood); and thus a
third.

5\. Or (each piece) with (the verse), 'Thine is this' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h.
II, 14).

6\. Or (he uses) both (this verse and the formulas given in Sûtra 3).

7 <span id="fr_778"></span>[7](#fn_777). The wiping and sprinkling (of
water) round (the fire are repeated) as above.

8\. Having warmed his two hands, he wipes his mouth with (the formulas):

'Agni, thou art the protector of bodies. Protect my body. Agni, thou art
the giver of life. Give me life. Agni, thou art the giver of vigour.
Give me vigour.

'Agni, what is deficient in my body, that restore to fulness.

'May the god Savit*ri* bestow insight on me, may the goddess Sarasvatî,
may the two divine A*s*vins, wreathed with lotus, (bestow) insight (on
me).'
