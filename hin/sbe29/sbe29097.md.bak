### KHA*ND*A 5.

Kha*nd*a 4, 11 <span id="fr_341"></span>[11-12](#fn_340.md). Now if the
time for rising has come, they drive away (all) evil,

12\. Perform the standing expiation,

13\. And look at the sun with (the words), 'From here I take out the
brightness (?).'

Kha*nd*a 5, 1 <span id="fr_342"></span>[1](#fn_341). 'That (I place.md)
within myself'—with (these words they turn their thoughts to the
universal) Self that is placed (within themselves?)three times repeated
(?).

2\. With (the formula), 'May happiness rejoice in me and glory; may
happiness rejoice with me and glory;—

3\. 'Together with Indra, with the hosts, with power, with glory, with
strength I will rise'—he rises up.

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

4\. 'May happiness rise to me; may glory rise to me'—when he has risen.

5\. 'Hereby I shake off the hater, the rival, the evil one, and the
bringer of misfortune'—with (this formula) having shaken the end of the
garment,—

6\. The hymn, 'Away those to the east' (Rig-veda X, 131), the two
(verses), 'And may Indra have mercy upon us' (II, 41, 11. 12), the one
(verse), 'Of what we are in fear, O Indra' (VIII, 50, 13)—(when these
texts have been murmured), they look with (the verse), 'A ruler indeed,
great art thou' (X, 152, 1) to the east; with (the verse), 'The giver of
bliss' (X, 152, 2) to the south, turned to the right; with (the verse),
'Away the Rakshas' (X, 152, 3) to the west; with (the verse), 'Destroy,
O Indra, our' (X, 152, 4) to the north, turned to the left; with (the
verse), 'Away, O Indra' (X, 152, 5) to the sky, turned to the right.

### Footnotes

Nârâya*n*a has the following note: 'The evil which is attached to their
body, such as dirt, they drive away, i.e. they remove it by means of
their reciting (of the sacred texts), and then they perform the standing
expiation which has been declared above, which begins with the syllable
Om and with the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis' (see chap. 3, 12).

<span id="fn_341"></span>[147:1](sbe29097.htm#fr_342.md) 5, 1. Nârâya*n*a
says that dadhe is supplied to this Mantra from the preceding Sûtra, and
so indeed the Mantra is given in the Aitareya recension. The translation
of abhinihita*m* trir hitam is merely tentative; see Nârâya*n*a's note,
p. 165, of the German edition. Perhaps abhinihita*m* should be taken in
its grammatical value, and the Sûtra should be translated, "That (I
place) into myself (âtmani)"—with these words (they look) at themselves,
pronouncing (the word âtmani) with Abhinidhâna, three times repeated
(?).' On abhinidhâna, comp. Professor Max Müller's edition of the
Rig-veda Prâti*s*âkhya, pp. cxvii seqq.
