<p>2. Having filled a new jug with flour of fried barley, he lays (this jug) and a spoon for offering the Balis on new strings of a carrying pole (and thus suspends them).</p>  
<p>3. Having prepared fried barley grains, he smears half of them with butter.</p>  
<p>4. After sunset he prepares a mess of cooked food and a cake in one dish and sacrifices (the cooked food) with the four verses, 'Agni, lead us on a good path to wealth' (Rig-veda I, 189, 1 seqq.), verse by verse, and with his hand the (cake) in one dish with (the formula), 'To the steady One, the earth-demon, sv&acirc;h&acirc;!'</p>  
<p>5. (The cake) should be (entirely) immersed (into the butter), or its back should be visible.</p>  
<p>6. With (the verse), 'Agni, do not deliver us to evil' (Rig-veda I, 189, 5) he sacrifices over it (the butter) in which it had lain.</p>

<p>goes out (of the house) to the east, pours water on the ground on a clean spot, sacrifices with (the formula), 'To the divine hosts of the serpents sv&acirc;h&acirc;!' and does reverence to them with (the formula), 'The serpents which are terrestrial, which are aerial, which are celestial, which dwell in the directions (of the horizon)&#151;to them I have brought this Bali; to them I give over this Bali.'</p>  
<p>10. Having gone round (the Bali) from left to right, he sits down to the west of the Bali with (the words), 'The serpent art thou; the lord of the creeping serpents art thou; by food thou protectest men, by cake the serpents, by sacrifice the gods. To me, being in thee, the serpents being in thee should do no harm. I give over the firm one (i.e. the spoon) to thee.'</p>  
<p>11. 'Firm one, (I give) N.N. (in charge) to thee! Firm one, (I give) N.N. (in charge) to thee!'&#151;with (these words he gives) his people, man by man, (in charge to the serpent god);</p>  
<p>12. 'Firm one, I give myself in charge to thee!'&#151;with these words himself at the end.</p>  
<p>13. Let no one step between it (i.e. the Bali, and the sacrificer), until the giving in charge has been performed.</p>

N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's observation that the <I>S</I>r&acirc;va<I>n</I>a full moon can fall also under certain other Nakshatras than <I>S</I>rava<I>n</I>a itself, furnishes no reason why we should think here of solar months, as Prof. Stenzler proposes.</P>
