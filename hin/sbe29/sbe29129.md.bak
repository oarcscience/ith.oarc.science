### KA*ND*IKÂ 6.

1 <span id="fr_510"></span>[1](#fn_509.md). When going to mount a chariot
he should touch the wheels with his two hands separately with (the
words), 'I touch thy two fore-feet. Thy two wheels are the B*ri*hat and
the Rathantara (Sâmans).'

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

2 <span id="fr_511"></span>[2](#fn_510.md). 'Thy axle is the
Vâmadevya'—with (these words he touches) the two (naves) in which the
axle rests.

3\. He should mount (the chariot) with the right foot first, with (the
words), 'With Vâyu's strength I mount thee, with Indra's power and
sovereignty.'

4\. He should touch the reins, or if the horses have no reins, (he
should touch) the horses with a staff, with (the words), 'With Brahman's
splendour I seize you. With truth I seize you.'

5\. When (the horses) put themselves in motion, he should murmur, 'Go
forward to thousandfold successful vigour, divine chariot, carry us
forward!'—(and the verse), 'Free, strong be thy limbs!' (Rig-veda VI,
47, 26.)

6 <span id="fr_512"></span>[6](#fn_511.md). With this (verse he should
touch also) other articles of wood.

7\. 'May the two oxen be strong, the axle firm' (Rig-veda III, 53,
i7)—with (this verse) he should touch (each) part of the chariot
(alluded to in that verse).

8\. With (the verse), 'The earth, the good protectress, the unattained
heaven' (Rig-veda X, 63, 10) (he should ascend) a ship.

9\. With a new chariot he should drive round a widely known tree or
round a pool that does not dry up, with his right side turned towards
it, and then should fetch branches which bear fruits,

10\. Or something else that belongs to the household.

11\. (He then) should drive (in that chariot) to an assembly.

12\. Having murmured, while looking at the sun, (the verse), 'Make our
renown highest' (Rig-veda IV, 31, 15), he should descend.

13\. 'To the bull among my equals' (Rig-veda X, 166, 1)—(this verse he
should murmur) while approaching (that assembly?).

14\. 'May we be called to-day Indra's best friends' (Rig-veda I, 167,
10)—when the sun is setting.

15\. 'Thus I address you, O daughters of heaven, while you arise'
(Rig-veda IV, 51, 11)—when day appears.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_509"></span>[209:1](sbe29129.htm#fr_510.md) 6, 1. 'He should
touch at the same time the right wheel with his right hand, the left
wheel with his left hand.' Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[210:2](sbe29129.htm#fr_511.md) On the Vedic form
of the chariot and of the wheels, comp. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p.
247.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[210:6](sbe29129.htm#fr_512.md) According to
Nârâya*n*a this Sûtra would refer only to other vehicles of wood, which
he is directed to touch with that *Rik* when going to mount them.
Perhaps the commentator is right; the wording of the *Rik* is well in
keeping with his explanation.
