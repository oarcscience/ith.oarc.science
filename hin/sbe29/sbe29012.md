offering in a Brâhma*n*a.

8 <span id="fr_69"></span>[8](#fn_68.md). 'Without raising his knees, with
spread knees let him always offer his oblation; for the gods never

9 <span id="fr_70"></span>[9](#fn_69.md). 'But when he has repeated a text
sacred to Rudra, to the Rakshas, to the Manes, to the Asuras, or that
contains an imprecation, let him touch water, and so also when he has
touched his own body.'
