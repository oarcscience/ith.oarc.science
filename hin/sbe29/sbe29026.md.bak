### KHA*ND*A 24.

1 <span id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_104.md). Now the Gâtakarman (i.e.
ceremony for the new-born child).

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

2 <span id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_105). Let (the father.md) breathe three
times on the new-born child and then draw in his breath with the words,
'Draw in your breath with the *Rik*, breathe within with the Ya*g*us,
breathe forth with the Sâman.'

3\. Let him mix together butter and honey, milk curds and water, or
grind together rice and barley, and give it to eat (to the child) thrice
from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon),

4\. With (the verse), 'I administer to thee honey food for the festival,
the wisdom ("veda") raised by Savitar the bountiful; long-living,
protected by the gods, live a hundred autumns in this world, N.N.!'(with
these words) he gives him a name beginning with a sonant, with a
semivowel in it, consisting of two syllables, or of four syllables, or
also of six syllables; he should take a k*ri*t (suffix), not a taddhita.

5\. That (name only) his father and his mother should know.

6\. On the tenth day a name for common use, which is pleasing to the
Brâhma*n*as.

7\. Let him pulverise black and white and red hairs of a black ox,
intermix (that powder) with those four substances (see Sûtra 3), and
give it to eat (to the child) four times: such (is the opinion of)
Mâ*nd*ûkeya.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

8 <span id="fr_107"></span>[8](#fn_106). If he likes (let him do so.md)
with the words, 'Bhû*h*! The Rig-veda I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ!

'Bhuva*h*! The Ya*g*ur-veda I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ!

'Sva*h*! The Sâma-veda I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ!

'Bhûr bhuva*h* sva*h*! Vâkovâkya (colloquies), Itihâsa, and Purâ*n*a—Om!
All the Vedas I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ!'

9\. The production of intelligence (is performed) by thrice saying in
his right ear, 'Speech!'

10\. And let him recite over (the child the following text), 'Speech,
the goddess, united with mind, together with breath, the child, uttered
by Indra—may she rejoice in thee, the goddess, for the sake of joy, the
great one, the sweet sounding, the music, full of music, the flowing,
self-produced.'

11\. Let him tie a piece of gold to a hempen string,

12 <span id="fr_108"></span>[12](#fn_107). And bind it to (the child's.md)
right hand until (the mother) gets up (from childbed).

13\. After the tenth day let him give it to the Brâhma*n*as,

14\. Or keep it himself.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_104"></span>[49:1](sbe29026.htm#fr_105.md) 24, 1. Comp. Dr.
Speijer's essay on the *G*âtakarman (Leiden, 1872). Nârâya*n*a observes
that, as it is prescribed below (chap. 25, 4) that a mess of food is to
be cooked in the sûtikâgni, here the sûtikâgni is established, and
sacrifice is performed therein. The Sûtra I, 25, 4, from which it is to
be inferred that the sûtikâgni should be kept, is considered,
accordingly, as a *Gñ*âpaka (see Professor Bühler's notes on Âpastamba
I, II, 7; Gautama <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> I, 31; Nârâya*n*a's
note on chap. 25, 4, p. 133 of the German edition).

<span id="fn_105"></span>[50:2](sbe29026.htm#fr_106.md) Abhyavânya should
be corrected into abhyapânya, as in IV, 18, 1 nearly all the MSS. read
nivâta instead of nipâta. The *S*âmbavya MS. reads in the text, trir
abhyânyânuprâ*n*ya; in the commentary trir a*n*yapâ*n*yânuprâ*n*yâ.
Comp., on the terminology of the different vital airs, Speijer,
*G*âtakarma, p. 64 seq.; Eggeling, S.B.E., vol. xii, p. 20.
