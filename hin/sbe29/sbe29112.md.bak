Intangible Textual Heritage

### KA*ND*IKÂ 13.

1 <span id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_435). The Upanishad (treats of.md) the
Garbhalambhana, the Pu*m*savana, and the Anavalobhana (i.e. the
ceremonies for securing the conception of a child, the male gender of
the child, and for preventing disturbances which could endanger the
embryo).

2 <span id="fr_437"></span>[2](#fn_436.md). If he does not study (that
Upanishad), he

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

should in the third month of her pregnancy, under (the Nakshatra)
Tishya, give to eat (to the wife), after she has fasted, in curds from a
cow which has a calf of the same colour (with herself), two beans and
one barley grain for each handful of curds.

3\. To his question, 'What dost thou drink? What dost thou drink?' she
should thrice reply, 'Generation of a male child! Generation of a male
child!'

4\. Thus three handfuls (of curds).

5 <span id="fr_438"></span>[5](#fn_437.md). He then inserts into her right
nostril, in the shadow of a round apartment, (the sap of) an herb which
is not faded,

6 <span id="fr_439"></span>[6](#fn_438). According to some (teachers.md)
with the Pra*g*âvat and *G*îvaputra hymns.

7\. Having sacrificed of a mess of cooked food sacred to Pra*g*âpati, he
should touch the place of her heart with the (verse,) 'What is hidden, O
thou whose hair is well parted, in thy heart, in Pra*g*âpati, that I
know; such is my belief. May I not fall into distress that comes from
sons.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_435"></span>[179:1](sbe29112.htm#fr_436.md) 13, 1. Nârâya*n*a
evidently did not know the Upanishad here referred to; he states that it
belongs to another *S*âkhâ. Comp. Professor Max Müller's note on
B*ri*had Âra*n*yaka VI, 4, 24 (S.B.E., vol. xv, p. 222).

<span id="fn_436"></span>[179:2](sbe29112.htm#fr_437.md) 'He should give
her the two beans as a symbol of the testicles, and the barley grain as
a symbol of the penis.' Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[180:5](sbe29112.htm#fr_438.md) Nârâya*n*a (comp.
also the Prayogaratna, folio 40; Â*s*valâyanîya-G*ri*hya-Pari*s*ish*t*a
I, 25; NIS. Chambers 667) separates this rite from the ceremony
described in Sûtras 2-4. He says that Sûtras 2-4—as indeed is evidently
the case—refer to the Pu*m*savana, and in Sûtra 5 begins the
Anavalobhana (comp. garbharaksha*n*a, Sâṅkh. I, 21). To me it seems more
probable that the text describes one continuous ceremony. There is no
difficulty in supposing that of the Anavalobhana, though it is mentioned
in Sûtra 1, no description is given in the following Sûtras, the same
being the case undoubtedly with regard to the Garbhalambhana, of which a
description is found in the Â*s*v.-Pari*s*ish*t*a I, 25.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[180:6](sbe29112.htm#fr_439.md) Two texts
commencing â te garbho yonim etu and Agnir etu prathama*h*. See
Stenzler's Various Readings, p. 48, and the Bibliotheca Indica edition,
p. 61.
