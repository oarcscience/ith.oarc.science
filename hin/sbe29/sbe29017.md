departs from the house.

2\. 'The living one they bewail' (Rig-veda X, 40, 10), if she begins to
cry.

3 <span id="fr_89"></span>[3](#fn_88). The wife then smears the axle of
the chariot with clarified butter with this (verse), 'They feasted, they
got drunk' (Rig-veda I, 82, 2),

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

4\. And with the two (verses), 'Pure are thy wheels,' 'Thy two wheels'
(Rig-veda X, 85, 12. 16), of the two wheels the first with the first
(verse) and the second with the second (verse),

5\. And the two bulls.

6 <span id="fr_90"></span>[6](#fn_89). After (the wife?) has put, with
this (verse), 'In the box of the wheel' (Rig-veda VIII, 80, 7), a branch
of a fruit-bearing tree into each of the holes destined for the pins,

7\. Or, if (such branches) are (already) fixed, has recited (that verse)
over them,

8\. They then harness the two bulls with the two (verses), 'Harnessed be
thy right one' (Rig-veda I, 82, 5-6), (the bridegroom) reciting the
half-verse, 'White the two bulls' (Rig-veda X, 85, 10), over them when
they have been harnessed.

9\. Now should any part of the chariot break or burst, let him take the
girl to the house of one who keeps the sacred fires,

10\. And repair (the damage) with the verse, 'Cover thyself with the
Khadiras' (Rig-veda III, 53, 19).

11\. A knot with the verse, 'Him like a horse' (Rig-veda X, 143, 2).

12\. He then murmurs the five verses, 'May prosperity give us' (Rig-veda
V, 51, 11-15).

13\. 'Adorned with Ki*m*suka flowers' (Rig-veda X, 85, 20), when she
mounts the chariot;

14\. 'May no waylayers meet us' (ibid. 32), at a cross-way;

15\. 'Which the woman’s' (ibid. 31), near a cemetery;

16\. The half-verse, 'O tree with thy hundred

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

branches' (Rig-veda III, 8, 11), he mutters near a big tree;

17\. 'The good protectress' (Rig-Veda X, 63, 10), when she ascends a
ship;

18\. 'Carrying stones' (Rig-veda X, 53, 8), when she crosses a river;

19\. Optionally (he) also (murmurs the same verse, if that is done) with
the harnessed chariot;

20\. 'Up may your wave' (Rig-veda III, 33, 13), at deep places (in the
river);

21\. And (at such places) let her not look out.

22\. The seven verses, 'Here may delight' (Rig-veda X, 85, 27 seq.),
when she has reached the house, omitting the verses already employed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_88"></span>[39:3](sbe29017.htm#fr_89) 15, 3. Probably the
use of this verse on this occasion rests on the assonance of its opening
word akshan and aksha (rathâksha).

<span id="fn_89"></span>[40:6](sbe29017.htm#fr_90) See Nârâya*n*a's note
on *s*amyâgarta, p. 129 of the German edition.
