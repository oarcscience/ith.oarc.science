### INTRODUCTION

###### TO THE

# PÂRASKARA-G*RI*HYA-SÛTRA.

THE G*ri*hya-sûtra of Pâraskara, which belongs to the White Ya*g*ur-veda
and forms an appendix to Kâtyâyana's *S*rauta-sûtra, has been edited,
with a German translation, by the scholar who was the first to make a
G*ri*hya text accessible to Orientalists and to begin to grapple with
the first and most serious difficulties that beset its interpretation,
and who has continued since to do more than anyone else towards
elucidating that important branch of Vedic literature. It would be very
unbecoming in any one engaged in the study of G*ri*hya texts, not to
acknowledge most warmly the debt of gratitude which he owes to Professor
Stenzler. At the same time the respect due to the veteran editor and
interpreter of Â*s*valâyana and Pâraskara not only allows, but requires
that one who proposes to himself the same task at which Prof. Stenzler
has worked with so much learning, should state as clearly as possible
what that distinguished scholar has left for others to do, and why one
who prepares an English translation of Pâraskara has a very different
task from merely translating into English the German translation of
Prof. Stenzler.

If I may venture to express in one word the difference between Prof.
Stenzler's method, as I understand it, for getting at the meaning of a
doubtful or obscure passage, and the method which I have endeavoured to
follow, I should say that with Prof. Stenzler the first step and,

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I believe, in many
cases also the last step is to ask how *G*ayarâma and Râmak*ri*sh*n*a
understand the passage in question, while I hold that we ought rather to
make ourselves independent from those commentators in the sense in which
Prof. Max Müller once expressed himself <span
id="fr_652"></span>[1](#fn_651.md), 'not that I ever despise the
traditional interpretation which the commentators have preserved to us,
but because I think that, after having examined it, we have a right to
judge for ourselves.' There exists a commentary on the
Pâraskara-G*ri*hya which far surpasses in trustworthiness *G*ayarâma's
Sa*gg*anavallabha and Râmak*ri*sh*n*a's Sa*m*skâraga*n*apati, and which
is not composed by an author who, as says Goethe,

     —im Auslegen ist munter;  
Legt er nicht aus, so legt er unter.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But the leaves of
that commentary are scattered through a good many volumes. Here we find
a few lines of it in the *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a or in Kâtyâyana's
*S*rauta-sûtra; there *S*âṅkhâyana or Â*s*valâyana has preserved a word
or a sentence that belongs to it; or the law-books of Manu or
Yâ*gñ*avalkya help us to understand a difficult or doubtful aphorism of
our text. In one word: the only true commentary on a work like
Pâraskara's G*ri*hya is that which the ancient literature itself
furnishes. No one will say that in Prof. Stenzler's translation and
notes this commentary has not been consulted. But it has been consulted
perhaps not quite as much as it ought to have been, and Râmak*ri*sh*n*a
and *G*ayarâma have been consulted too much. They have been consulted
and followed in many instances, where a continued consideration of what
can be the meaning of a word and what can not, and of what the parallel
texts say with regard to the subject in question, would have shown that
those commentators, instead of interpreting Pâraskara's meaning, father
on him vague opinions of their own.

Perhaps it will not be out of place here to point our

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

criticism, lest it should be deemed unjust, by a few remarks on a single
passage of Pâraskara in which the difference of Prof. Stenzler's way of
translating and of our own becomes manifest. Of the numerous passages
which could be selected for this purpose, I choose Sûtra I, 2, 5,
belonging to the description of the setting up of the sacred domestic
fire. The text of that Sûtra runs thus:

5\. ara*n*ipradûnam eke.

Prof. Stenzler translates as follows:

'Einige sagen, es müsse durch Reibhölzer erzeugtes Feuer sein.'

The two Sûtras which precede give a description of that ceremony from
which evidently the opinion of the 'eke' mentioned in this Sûtra
differs, or to which they find it necessary to add something. Those
Sûtras run thus:

3\. After he has fetched fire from the house of a Vai*s*ya who is rich
in cattle—

4\. All ceremonies are performed as at the cooking of the
*k*âtushprâ*s*ya food <span id="fr_653"></span>[1](#fn_652.md).

It seems evident that the Â*k*âryas to whom the opinion spoken of in
Sûtra 5 belongs, add, or perhaps substitute, to the fetching of the fire
which is to be worshipped as the sacrificer's domestic fire, from a rich
Vai*s*ya's house, another rite in which an ara*n*i, i.e. a stick for
kindling the fire by attrition, is made use of in some way or other.

Now if this may be accepted as a vague expression of the general purport
of the Sûtra, what is the literal meaning of the words? 'Some
(teachers),' it says, '(prescribe) the pradâna of the kindling stick
(or, of the kindling sticks).'

What does pradâna mean? *G*ayarâma says,

'pra*s*abda upa*s*abdârthe. ara*n*yupâdânakam eka â*k*âryâ i*kkh*anti.'

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

That is: 'The word pra stands in the sense of the word upa. Some
teachers desire that it (i.e. the fire) should have the kindling sticks
as its physical basis <span id="fr_654"></span>[1](#fn_653.md).'

Thus, if *G*ayarâma is right, Prof. Stenzler's translation would be
justified. But can we acquiesce indeed in simply accepting the
commentator's opinion? Pradâna is pradâna and not upâdâna, as pradadâti
is not upâdatte. Pradadâti means 'he hands over,' and pradâna 'the
handing over.' This is an established fact, and an interpreter of a
Vedic text should not allow himself to be induced by a statement like
that of *G*ayarâma about the preposition pra standing in the sense of
upa, to abate one iota of it. Thus we are obliged, until passages have
been discovered which modify our knowledge of what pradâna means—but
such passages most certainly will never be discovered—to translate:

5\. Some (teachers say that) the handing over of the kindling sticks
(takes place).

We should give that translation even if we were not able to find an
explanation for it. It appears that Prof. Stenzler, as far as we can
judge from his note, has not even thought of the possibility of
disregarding the authority of *G*ayarâma and Râmak*ri*sh*n*a, or of
looking through the parallel texts to see whether they do not throw
light on what that 'handing over of the kindling sticks' signifies. The
text to be consulted first is of course Kâtyâyana's *S*rauta-sûtra. As
the *S*rauta ritual contains a description of an âdhâna which is in some
way the prototype of the corresponding G*ri*hya ceremony, we may
possibly expect to discover, in the course of that description, the
statements regarding the ara*n*i-pradâna for which we are searching. Now
Kâtyâyana <span id="fr_655"></span>[2](#fn_654.md), having described the
setting up of the fire in the gârhapatyâgâra, states that at sunset the
sacrificer and his

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

wife sit down to the west of the fire which has just been established,
and then the Adhvaryu hands over to them the two kindling sticks <span
id="fr_656"></span>[1](#fn_655.md). The Paddhati, in describing that act,
goes into further details. The Adhvaryu hands over to the sacrificer the
two Ara*n*is, which, as required by custom, are wrapped up in new
clothes. The wife takes the adharâra*n*i from his hand and puts it on
her lap; the sacrificer puts the uttarâra*n*i on his lap, and they do
homage to them with flowers, saffron, sandal wood, &c.; then, after the
performance of some other ceremonies, they put the two Ara*n*is away on
a chair or bench. The two Ara*n*is have to be kept by the sacrificer; if
they are lost or burnt or destroyed in any other way, other Ara*n*is
must be procured, and by their attrition a new fire must be
kindled <span id="fr_657"></span>[2](#fn_656.md).

Âpastamba likewise mentions, in his description of the Agnyâdhâna <span
id="fr_658"></span>[3](#fn_657.md), the handing over of the two Ara*n*is,
and indicates a Mantra which the Adhvaryu recites in giving them to the
sacrificer, and two other Mantras with the one of which the sacrificer
receives them, while he recites the other over the Ara*n*is, after
having taken them into his hands.

Finally we may quote here, as bearing witness to the custom of the
Ara*n*ipradâna, a passage taken from Nârâya*n*a's commentary on the
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya. Though the decisive words in that passage rest
only on the authority of the commentator and not of the Sûtrakâra
himself, they deserve to be taken notice of, as they are not subject to
the suspicion that they could be influenced by a misunderstanding of
that very Sûtra of Pâraskara of which we are treating. Nârâya*n*a says,
in his explanation of *S*âṅkhâyana I, 1, 10 <span
id="fr_659"></span>[4](#fn_658.md): 'To the west of the fire the
sacrificer, and southwards (of him) the wife sits down. The

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

handing over of the kindling sticks does not take place. For it is a
fire fetched (from a Vai*s*ya's house, &c.) which is inaugurated
here <span id="fr_660"></span>[1](#fn_659.md).' Then the commentator goes
on to quote a *S*loka:

'The handing over of the Ara*n*is which the Adhvaryu sometimes performs,

'Is not in accordance with the opinion of Suya*gñ*a <span
id="fr_661"></span>[2](#fn_660.md); he does not approve of kindling the
fire by attrition <span id="fr_662"></span>[3](#fn_661.md):

Thus, I think, no doubt can remain as to the real meaning of Pâraskara's
Sûtra: it means what its words signify and what is in accordance with
Kâtyâyana and Âpastamba, and it does not mean what the commentators most
gratuitously would make it mean.

Perhaps I have dwelt here too long on the interpretation of a few words
which are of no peculiar interest in themselves. But I venture to hope
that the discussion on these words will serve as a specimen, by which
the fundamental difference of two methods of handling our texts may be
discerned. Let us never forget how much we owe to the scholars who have
followed the first of these methods, but for ourselves let us choose the
second.
