### KA*ND*IKÂ 3.

1 <span id="fr_367"></span>[1](#fn_366.md). Now wherever he intends to
perform a sacrifice, let him besmear (with cowdung) a surface of the
dimension at least of an arrow on each side; let him draw six lines
thereon, one turned to the north, to the west (of the spot on which the
fire is to be placed); two (lines) turned to the east, at the two
different ends (of the line mentioned first); three (lines) in the
middle (of those two); let him sprinkle that (place with water),
establish the (sacred) fire (thereon), put (two or three pieces of fuel)
on it, wipe (the ground) round (the fire), strew (grass) round (it), to
the east, to the south, to the west, to the north, ending (each time) in
the north. Then (follows) silently the sprinkling (of water) round (the
fire).

2\. With two (Ku*s*a blades used as) strainers the purifying of the
Â*g*ya (is done).

3 <span id="fr_368"></span>[3](#fn_367.md). Having taken two Ku*s*a blades
with unbroken tops, which do not bear a young shoot in them, of the
measure of a span, at their two ends with his

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

thumbs and fourth fingers, with his hands turned with the inside
upwards, he purifies (the Â*g*ya, from the west) to the east, with (the
words), 'By the impulse of Savit*ri* I purify thee with this uninjured
purifier, with the rays of the good sun'—once with this formula, twice
silently.

4 <span id="fr_369"></span>[4](#fn_368). The strewing (of grass.md) round
(the fire) may be done or not done in the Â*g*ya offerings.

5 <span id="fr_370"></span>[5](#fn_369.md). So also the two Â*g*ya portions
(may optionally be sacrificed) in the Pâkaya*gñ*as.

6 <span id="fr_371"></span>[6](#fn_370). And the (assistance of a.md)
Brahman (is optional), except at the sacrifice to Dhanvantari and at the
sacrifice of the spit-ox (offered to Rudra).

7 <span id="fr_372"></span>[7](#fn_371.md). Let him sacrifice with (the
words), 'To such and such a deity svâhâ!'

8\. If there is no rule (as to the deities to whom the sacrifice
belongs, they are) Agni, Indra, Pra*g*âpati, the Vi*s*ve devâs, Brahman.

9 <span id="fr_373"></span>[9](#fn_372). (Different Pâkaya*gñ*as, when.md)
offered at the same time, should have the same Barhis (sacrificial
grass), the same fuel, the same Â*g*ya, and the same (oblation to Agni)
Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

10\. With reference thereto the following sacrificial stanza is sung:

'He who has to perform (different) Pâkaya*gñ*as, should offer them with
the same Â*g*ya, the same

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Barhis, and the
same Svish*t*ak*ri*t, even if the deity (of those sacrifices) is not the
same.'
