### KA*ND*IKÂ 6.

1 <span id="fr_546"></span>[1](#fn_545). Instead of the Kâmya ceremonies
(i.e. the ceremonies, prescribed in the *S*rauta-sûtra, by which

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

special wishes are attained, oblations of) boiled (rice) grains, for the
attainment of those wishes, (should be made by the G*ri*hya sacrificer).

2\. He attains (thereby) those same wishes.

3\. For a person that is sick, or suffering, or affected with
consumption, a mess of boiled (rice) grains in six oblations (should he
offered)—

4\. With this (hymn), 'I loosen thee by sacrificial food, that thou
mayst live' (Rig-veda X, 161).

5\. If he has seen a bad dream, he should worship the sun with the two
verses, 'To-day, god Savit*ri*' (Rig-veda V, 82, 4, 5), and with the
five verses, 'What bad dreams there are among the cows' (Rig-veda VIII,
47, 14 seqq.),

6\. Or with (the verse), 'Whosoever, O king, be it a companion or a
friend' (Rig-veda II, 28, 10).

7\. When he has sneezed, yawned, seen a disagreeable sight, smelt a bad
smell, when his eye palpitates, and when he hears noises in his ears, he
should murmur, 'Well-eyed may I become with my eyes, well-vigoured with
my face, well-hearing with my ears. May will and insight dwell in me!'

8 <span id="fr_547"></span>[8](#fn_546). If he has gone to a wife to
whom he ought not to go, or if he has performed a sacrifice for a person
for whom he ought not to do so, or has eaten forbidden food, or accepted
what he ought not to accept, or pushed against a piled-up (fire altar)
or

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

against a sacrificial post, he should sacrifice two Â*g*ya oblations
with (the verses),

'May my faculties return into me, may life return, may prosperity
return; may my goods return to me; may the divine power return into me.
Svâhâ!

'These fires that are stationed on the (altars called) Dhish*n*yâs, may
they be here in good order, each on its right place. (Agni)
Vai*s*vânara, grown strong, the standard of immortality, may he govern
my mind in my heart. Svâhâ!'

9\. Or (he may sacrifice) two pieces of wood,

10\. Or murmur (the same two verses without any oblation).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_545"></span>[223:1](sbe29139.htm#fr_546) 6, 1. Nârâya*n*a
divides this Sûtra into two: 1. atha kâmyânâ*m* sthâne kâmyâ*h*; 2.
*k*arava*h*.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[224:8](sbe29139.htm#fr_547) Nârâya*n*a is
evidently wrong in explaining *k*aitya*m* yûpa*ñ* *k*a by
agni*k*ayanastha*m* yûpa*m* (which is not, as Prof. Stenzler takes it,
der Opferpfahl auf einem Bestattungsplatze). Comp. Gobhila III, 3, 34;
G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha-pari*s*ish*t*a II, 4.

I have translated the second verse in Sûtra 8, as if the text had
kalpantâm. The MSS. give kalpatâm. Atharva-veda VII, 67 has kalpayantâm.
