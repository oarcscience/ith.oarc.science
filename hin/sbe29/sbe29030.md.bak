### KHA*ND*A 28.

1 <span id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_116.md). After one year the
*K*û*d*âkarman (i.e. the tonsure of the child's head);

2\. Or in the third year;

3\. In the fifth for a Kshatriya;

4\. In the seventh for a Vai*s*ya.

5\. Having placed the fire (in the outer hall; see chap. 5, 2)—

6\. And having filled vessels with rice and barley, sesamum seeds and
beans,

7\. And having put down northwards bull-dung and a layer of Ku*s*a grass
for receiving the hair, a mirror, fresh butter, and a razor of copper,

8\. He pours cold water into warm with (the verse), 'Mix yourselves, ye
holy ones, with your waves, ye honied ones, mixing milk with honey, ye
lovely ones, for the obtaining of wealth.'

9\. 'May the waters moisten thee for life, for old age and splendour.
The threefold age of *G*amadagni, Ka*s*yapa's threefold age, the
threefold age of

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agastya, the
threefold age that belongs to the gods, that threefold age I produce for
thee! N.N.!'—with these words he sprinkles the right part of his hair
three times with lukewarm water.

10\. Having loosened the tangled locks, according to some (teachers),
with a porcupine's quill,

11\. And having anointed (his hair)with fresh butter,

12\. He puts a young Ku*s*a shoot among (the hairs) with the words,
'Herb, protect him!'

13\. Having touched the hair and the Ku*s*a shoot with the mirror,

14\. He takes up the copper razor with the words, Sharpness art thou;
the axe is thy father. Do no harm to him!'

15 <span id="fr_118"></span>[15](#fn_117). With (the words.md), 'The razor
with which in the beginning Savitar, the knowing one, has shaven the
beard of king Varu*n*a, and with which Dhâtar B*ri*haspati has shaven
Indra's head, with that, ye Brâhma*n*as, shave this (head) to-day;
blessed with long life, with old age be this man N.N.!' he cuts the tips
of the hairs and the Ku*s*a shoot.

16\. In the same way a second time; in the same way a third time.

17\. In the same way twice on the left side.

18\. Under the armpits a sixth and a seventh time at the Godânakarman
(ceremony of shaving the beard).

19\. The Godânakarman is identical with the *K*û*d*âkarman,

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

20\. (It is to be performed) in the sixteenth or in the eighteenth year.

21\. At the third turn of shaving, however, he gives a cow and a garment
that has not yet been washed.

22\. Silently the rites (are performed) for girls.

23\. To the north-east, in a place covered with herbs, or in the
neighbourhood of water they bury the hairs in the earth.

24 <span id="fr_119"></span>[24](#fn_118.md). To the barber the vessels of
grain. To the barber the vessels of grain.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_116"></span>[55:1](sbe29030.htm#fr_117.md) 28, 1.
*K*û*l*âkarman literally means, the preparing of the lock or the locks
(left when the rest of the hair is shaven).

<span id="fn_117"></span>[56:15](sbe29030.htm#fr_118.md) The parallel texts
show that instead of B*ri*haspatir we have to read B*ri*haspater,
instead of adya, asya. So the correct translation would be, '. . . with
what Dhâtar has shaven B*ri*haspati's and Indra's head, with that do ye
Brâhma*n*as shave this head of this (child).'
