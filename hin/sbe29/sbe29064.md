### KHA*ND*A 2.

1 <span id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_236) Now (follows) the Ekoddish*t*a
(i.e. the *S*râddha ceremony directed to a single dead person),

2\. With one strainer,

3 <span id="fr_238"></span>[3](#fn_237). One (pot of) Argha-water,

4\. One lump (of flour).

5 <span id="fr_239"></span>[5](#fn_238). No inviting (takes place here),
nor the putting

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

(of food) into the fire, nor (do) the Vi*s*ve devâs (take part in this
ceremony). 'Relished?'—thus are they to be asked whether they are
satiated. 'May it approach (the fathers),' instead of 'imperishable.'

6\. 'Be satisfied,' when sending them away.

7\. Thus through one year, when one has died.

8 <span id="fr_240"></span>[8](#fn_239). And (then) omission of the
fourth one.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[108:1](sbe29064.htm#fr_237) 2, 1. Eka
uddish*t*o yasmin *s*râddhe tad ekoddish*t*am (Nâr.). This is the kind
of *S*râddha sacrifice which is to be performed for one twice-born
during the first year after his death; see Manu III, 247; Yâ*gñ*avalkya
I, 250.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[108:3](sbe29064.htm#fr_238) This rule about
the Argha water corresponds to those given with regard to the Pârva*n*a
*S*râddha in the Sûtras 3 and 4 of the preceding chapter.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[108:5](sbe29064.htm#fr_239) 'Because the
âvâhana (inviting) is forbidden here, it follows <span id="page_109">p.
109</span> that it must take place at the Pârva*n*a *S*râddha' (Nâr.).
According to Râma*k*andra's Paddhati he shall say to the Brâhma*n*as, 'I
will invite hither the fathers;' and when they give their consent, he
invites them with Rig-veda X, 16, 12. Comp. Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 232 seq.,
&c. Regarding the Vi*s*ve devâs comp. the note on chap. 1, 2; as to the
t*ri*ptapra*s*na (the question whether they are satiated) comp. Manu
III, 251; Yâ*gñ*. I, 240. At the Pârva*n*a *S*râddha, after the
Brâhma*n*as have finished their dinner and rinsed their mouths, and
after the Pi*nd*as have been offered, the sacrificer says, 'May what has
been given at this *S*râddha to our father N.N., who belongs to the
gotra N.N., be imperishable!' (comp. Yâ*gñ*. I, 242.) This phrase is to
be altered at the Ekoddish*t*a *S*râddha in the way indicated in this
Sûtra.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[109:8](sbe29064.htm#fr_240) After the
Ekoddish*t*a *S*râddha has been performed for a dead person during the
first year after his death, he is to be admitted, by the
Sapi*nd*îkara*n*a ceremony, among the other Manes, and receives
thenceforward his Pi*nd*a together with them at the ordinary Pârva*n*a
*S*râddha. As the ritual of this *S*râddha requires that the number of
the 'fathers' worshipped should be three, the accession of a new person
makes necessary the omission of the pra-pra-pitâmaha, who has now become
fourth among the fathers.
