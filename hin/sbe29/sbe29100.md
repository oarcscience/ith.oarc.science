# Â*S*VALÂYANA-G*RI*HYA-SUTRA.

### ADHYÂYA I, KA*ND*IKÂ 1.

1 <span id="fr_359"></span>[1](#fn_358). The (rites.md) based on the
spreading (of the three sacred fires) have been declared; we shall
declare the G*ri*hya (rites).

2 <span id="fr_360"></span>[2](#fn_359). There are three (kinds of.md)
Pâkaya*gñ*as, the hutas, (i.e. the sacrifices) offered over the fire;
over something that is not the fire, the prahutas; and at the feeding of
Brâhma*n*as, those offered in the Brahman.

3 <span id="fr_361"></span>[3](#fn_360.md). And they quote also *Rik*as,
'He who with a piece of wood or with an oblation, or with knowledge
("veda").'

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

4 <span id="fr_362"></span>[4](#fn_361.md). Even he who only puts a piece
of wood (on the fire) full of belief, should think, 'Here I offer a
sacrifice; adoration to that (deity)!'

(The *Rik* quoted above then says), 'He who with an oblation'—and, 'He
who with knowledge;' even by learning only satisfaction is produced (in
the gods).

Seeing this the *Ri*shi has said, 'To him who does not keep away from
himself the cows, to him who longs for cows, who dwells in the sky,
speak a wonderful word, sweeter than ghee and honey.' Thereby he means,
'This my word, sweeter than ghee and honey, is satisfaction (to the
god); may it be sweeter.'

(And another *Ri*shi says), 'To thee, O Agni, by this *Rik* we offer an
oblation prepared by our heart; may these be oxen, bulls, and cows.'
(Thereby he means), 'They are my oxen, bulls, and cows (which I offer to
the god), they who study this text, reciting it for themselves (as their
Svâdhyâya).'

(And further on the *Rik* quoted above says), 'He who (worships Agni)
with adoration, offering rich sacrifices.' 'Verily also by the
performing of adoration (the gods may be worshipped); for the gods are
not beyond the performing of adoration; adoration verily is
sacrifice'—thus runs a Brâhma*n*a.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_358"></span>[159:1](sbe29100.htm#fr_359.md) 1, 1. The
spreading (vitâna or, as it is also called, vihâra or vistâra) of the
sacred fires is the taking of two of the three sacrificial fires, the
Âhavanîya fire and the Dakshi*n*âgni, out of the Gârhapatya fire (see,
for instance, Weber's Indische Studien, IX, 216 seq.). The rites based
on, or connected with the vitâna; are the rites forming the subject of
the *S*rauta ritual, which are to be performed with the three fires.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[159:2](sbe29100.htm#fr_360.md) Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 5, 1; I, 10, 7. The division here is somewhat
different from that given by *S*âṅkhâyana; what *S*âṅkhâyana calls
ahuta, is here prahuta ('sacrificed up'); the prahutas of *S*âṅkhâyana
form here no special category; the prâ*s*itas of *S*âṅkhâyana are the
brahma*n*i hutâs of Â*s*valâyana. Thus Â*s*valâyana has three
categories, while *S*âṅkhâyana (and quite in the same way Pâraskara I,
4, 1) gives four. Nârâya*n*a mentions as an example of prahuta
sacrifices the balihara*n*a prescribed below, I, 2, 3.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[159:3](sbe29100.htm#fr_361.md) Rig-veda VIII, 19,
5, The mortal who with a piece of wood, or with an oblation, or with
knowledge worships Agni, who with adoration (worships him) offering rich
sacrifices,' &c.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[160:4](sbe29100.htm#fr_362.md) The words of the
*Rik*, 'with an oblation,' are here repeated, the Vedic instrumental
âhutî being replaced and explained by the regular form âhutyâ.

The following *Rik* is taken from the eighth Ma*nd*ala, 24, 20. The god
compared there with a rutting bull is Indra.

The following verse is Rig-veda VI, 16, 47; we may doubt as to the
correctness of the explanation given in our text, by which te te is
referred to the persons studying the hymns of the *Ri*shi. All these
quotations of course are meant to show that the knowledge of the Veda
and the performing of namas (adoration) is equivalent to a real
sacrifice.
