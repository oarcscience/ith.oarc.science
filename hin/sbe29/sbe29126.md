(oblations) of milk-rice with (the texts), 'Beat away, O white one, with
thy foot, with the forefoot and with the hind-foot, these seven
daughters of Varu*n*a and all that belong to the king's tribe. Svâhâ!

'Within the dominion of the white one no serpent has killed anything. To
the white one, the son of Vidârva, adoration! Svâhâ!'

6\. (Saying), 'Be happy and friendly to us'—he should think in his mind
of the winter.

7\. To the west of the fire is a well-spread layer (of straw); on that
he should sit down, murmur (the verse), 'Be soft, O earth' (Rig-veda I,
22, 15), and lie down (on that layer) with his people, with the head to
the east and the face to the north.

8\. The others, as there is room.

9\. Or following on each other from the eldest to the youngest.

10 <span id="fr_494"></span>[10](#fn_493.md). Those who know the Mantras,
should murmur the Mantras.

11 <span id="fr_495"></span>[11](#fn_494). Arising (they should.md) three
times (murmur the verse), 'From that place may the gods bless us'
(Rig-veda I, 22, 16).

12 <span id="fr_496"></span>[12](#fn_495). The same (verse.md) a fourth
time with their faces to the south, to the west, and to the north.

eat, he should cause (them) to pronounce auspicious words.
