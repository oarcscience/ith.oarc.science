### KHA*ND*A 8.

1 <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_42). Now (follows.md) the strewing (of
grass) around (the fire).

2\. He strews eastward-pointed Ku*s*a grass around it, in three layers
or in five layers,

3\. Beginning on the east side, then to the west, then to the west.

4\. He covers the roots (of the grass-blades) with the points.

5\. And all kinds of rites are to be performed beginning south, ending
north.

6 <span id="fr_44"></span>[6](#fn_43.md). He places the Brahman south with
the words, BHÛR BHUVA*H* SVA*H*,

7\. Adorns him with flowers,

8 <span id="fr_45"></span>[8](#fn_44.md). Carries forward on the north side
the Pra*n*îtâ waters with the words, 'Who carries ye forward?'—

9 <span id="fr_46"></span>[9](#fn_45.md). Takes up with the left hand the
Ku*s*a blades, and arranges them (on the ground) with the right hand,

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

10\. Bending his right knee,

11\. The left when worshipping the Manes.

12\. The strewing around (of the grass) is not necessary in the Â*g*ya
offerings,

13 <span id="fr_47"></span>[13](#fn_46.md). Nor in the standing offerings,
according to Mâ*nd*ûkeya.

14 <span id="fr_48"></span>[14-16](#fn_47.md). He now measures off with the
span (of his hand) two Ku*s*a blades, which are not unequal, with
unbroken points, bearing no young shoots in them, and severs them (from
their roots) with a Ku*s*a blade, saying, 'Purifiers are ye.'

15\. There are two or three (of these Ku*s*a strainers).

16\. He holds them with their points to the east and sprinkles them
(with water, saying), 'Belonging to Vish*n*u.'

17\. With the two Ku*s*a blades he sprinkles (water) around the fire
three times, keeping his right side turned towards it,

18 <span id="fr_49"></span>[18](#fn_48.md). Takes up the Â*g*ya pot with
the words, 'Milk of the cows art thou;'

19 <span id="fr_50"></span>[19](#fn_49.md). Puts it on the fire with the
words, 'For sap thee;'

20 <span id="fr_51"></span>[20](#fn_50.md). Takes it from the fire towards
the north with the words, 'For juice thee;'

21 <span id="fr_52"></span>[21](#fn_51). And holding the two (Ku*s*a.md)
strainers with their points to the north, seizing them on both sides

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

with his two thumbs and fourth fingers, he bends them down, the points
upwards, and dips them into the Â*g*ya with the words,

'By the impulse of Savitar I purify thee with this uninjured purifier,
with the rays of the good sun.'

22\. (This) preparation of the Â*g*ya (takes place) each time.

23\. Let him not offer (Â*g*ya) which has not been (thus) prepared.

24 <span id="fr_53"></span>[24-25](#fn_52.md). Also the waters in the Sruva
spoon (he purifies) with the words, '(By the impulse) of Savitar (I
purify) you.'

25\. This (is called) the PRA*N*ÎTÂ and the PROKSHA*N*Î water.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_42"></span>[24:1](sbe29010.htm#fr_43.md) 8, 1. Comp. the
passages quoted in Professor Eggeling's note on *S*atapatha Br. I, 1, 1,
22.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[24:6](sbe29010.htm#fr_44.md) Ordinarily there was
no real Brahman present, and his place was filled by a bundle of Ku*s*a
grass that represented him. Nârâya*n*a states that this bundle should
consist of fifty blades of Ku*s*a grass. Comp. also the
G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha-pari*s*ish*t*a I, 89-90.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[24:8](sbe29010.htm#fr_45.md) Comp. the passages
quoted by Dr. Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländ.
Gesellschaft, vol. xxxv, p. 565, note 2.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[24:9](sbe29010.htm#fr_46.md) This Sûtra shows that
the paristara*n*a, though already treated of in Sûtras 1-4, is not to be
performed till after the 'carrying forward' of the Pra*n*îtâ water.
Comp. Nârâya*n*a's note on Sûtra 1 (p. 123 of the German edition). That
this is indeed the order of the different acts is confirmed by Pâraskara
I, 1, 2.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[25:13](sbe29010.htm#fr_47.md) 'In the standing
offerings, such as the Vai*s*vadeva sacrifice in the morning and in the
evening.' Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[25:14-16](sbe29010.htm#fr_48.md) Vâ*g*asaneyi
Sa*m*hitâ I, 12 a.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[25:18](sbe29010.htm#fr_49.md) Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. IV, 3
a.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[25:19](sbe29010.htm#fr_50.md) Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. I, 22

c.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[25:21](sbe29010.htm#fr_52.md) Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. I, 12
b.—The division of Sûtras 21 and 22 should be after iti, not, as the
Indian tradition has it, after ra*s*mibhi*h*.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[26:24-25](sbe29010.htm#fr_53.md) 24, 25.
Râma*k*andra: 'He pours water into the Sruva and purifies this also, as
he had done with the Â*g*ya (Sûtra 21) . . . . He then pours a little
portion of that water on to the Pra*n*îtâ water (see above, Sûtra 8),
and with the rest, which is called the Proksha*n*î water, he sprinkles
the sacrificial food, the fuel, and the Barhis.'
