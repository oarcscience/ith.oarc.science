bring prosperity.

4\. Or he may get it from a frying-pan.

5\. Or from the house of one who offers many sacrifices, with the
exception of a *S*ûdra.

6\. The service (at that sacred domestic fire) begins with an evening
oblation.

7\. After (the fire) has been set in a blaze before sunset or sunrise—

9\. (And) after sunrise or before sunrise.

10 <span id="fr_1002"></span>[10-19](#fn_1001.md). He should with his hand

(Svâhâ)!'

16\. The wiping round the fire and the similar acts, with the exception
of the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire), are omitted here.

17\. Some (teachers say) that his wife may offer these oblations, for
the wife is (as it were) the house, and that fire is the domestic fire.
