should be the finest (bull) in the herd. And besides they should adorn
the best four young cows of the herd and let them loose with this
(verse), 'This young (bull) I give you as your husband; run about
sporting with him, your lover. Do not bring down a curse upon us, by
nature blessed ones. May we rejoice in increase of wealth and in
comfort.'

to the Brâhma*n*as to eat.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[353:1](sbe29199.htm#fr_908.md) 9, 1 seqq. Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana III, 11.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[353:2](sbe29199.htm#fr_909.md) See above, chap.
8, 15.

<span id="fn_909"></span>[353:3](sbe29199.htm#fr_910.md) *S*âṅkhâyana, loc.
cit. § 2.

<span id="fn_910"></span>[353:4](sbe29199.htm#fr_911.md) *S*âṅkhâyana, § 3.
Of course, in Professor Stenzler's translation, 'in der Mitte der Küche'
is a misprint for 'in der Mitte der Kühe.'

<span id="fn_911"></span>[354:5](sbe29199.htm#fr_912.md) Rig-veda VI, 54,
5; *S*âṅkhâyana, § 5.

<span id="fn_912"></span>[354:6](sbe29199.htm#fr_913.md) *S*âṅkhâyana, §§
6-54. On the Rudra hymns, see above, chap. 8, § 13. Perhaps the words mâ
na*h* *s*âpta are corrupt; the correct reading may possibly be,
mâ<sup>ऽ</sup>vasthâta.

<span id="fn_913"></span>[354:7](sbe29199.htm#fr_914.md) *S*âṅkhâyana, §
15. There is no Mantra in the Vâ*g*asaneyi Sa*m*hitâ beginning with the
word mayobhû*h*, but this word occurs in the middle of XVIII, 45 a; the
texts which he recites begin at that word and extend down to the end of
the Anuvâka. It is clear that mayobhû*h* was intended in the original
text, from which both *S*âṅkhâyana and Pâraskara have taken this Sûtra,
as the *Ri*k-Pratika, Rig-veda X, 169, 1.

<span id="fn_914"></span>[355:9\_9](sbe29199.htm#fr_915.md) According to
the commentators, a goat is sacrificed.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[355:9\_10](sbe29199.htm#fr_916.md) See chap. 8.
