should touch the uncovered place of her navel with (the verse), 'The two
men' (MB. I, 4, 8).

20\. Then another (ceremony). Having bought for three times seven barley
corns or beans, a Nyagrodha-shoot which has fruits on both sides, which
is not dry, and not touched by worms, he should set that up with (the
formula), Ye herbs everywhere, being well-minded, bestow strength on
this (shoot); for it will do its work.'

21\. He then should take it and place it in the open air.

22\. A girl, or a (wife) addicted (to her husband), or a student, or a
Brâhma*n*î should pound (that Nyagrodha-shoot) without moving backward
(the stone with which she pounds it).

23\. (The husband) should make (the wife) who has bathed, lie down, and
should insert (that pounded substance) into her right nostril with (the
verse), 'A man is Agni' (MB. I, 4, 9).

24 <span id="fr_1015"></span>[24-27](#fn_1014.md). Then in the fourth or

25\. After she has bathed, her husband should put on her a garment that

and after having sacrificed, he should stand behind her and should part
her hair once with a well-proportioned (?) branch of a tree, on which
there are fruits, (and) with a porcupine's quill that has three white
spots, with (the verse), 'Rich in sap is this tree' (MB. I, 5, 1).

26\. While she looks at a mess of boiled rice with sesamum seeds,
covered with ghee, he should ask her, 'What dost thou see?'

27\. He should make her reply, 'Offspring!'

28 <span id="fr_1016"></span>[28-34](#fn_1015.md). When the child is
appearing, the sacrifice for the woman in labour (is to be performed)—

29\. With the two verses, 'She who athwart' (MB. I, 5, 6 seq.).

30\. He should give a name to the child, 'N.N.!'

31\. That (is his) secret (name).

32\. Before the navel-string is cut off and the breast is given (to the
child, the father) should have rice and barley grains pounded in the way
prescribed for the Nyagrodha-shoot (see Sûtra 22).

33\. He should take thereof with his (right) thumb and fourth finger and
give it to the child to eat, with (the formula), 'This order' (MB. I, 5,
8).

34\. And butter with (the verse), 'May intelligence to thee' (MB. I, 5,
9).
