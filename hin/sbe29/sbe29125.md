<span id="fn_488"></span>[203:2](sbe29125.htm#fr_489.md) 2, 2. 'The plural
"They should sacrifice it" means, that while the sacrifice is performed
by the householder, his sons and the other persons belonging to the
house should touch him.' Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[203:4](sbe29125.htm#fr_490.md) The Âgraya*n*a
sacrifice, which is offered when the sacrificer is going to partake of
the first-fruits of the harvest, is treated of, with relation to a
sacrificer who keeps the *S*rauta fires, in the *S*rauta-sûtra II, q.
This Sûtra in my opinion should be understood as a supplementary
addition to that chapter. Nârâya*n*a refers the rule here given to the
case of any incident or danger (âpad) which prevents the sacrificer from
performing the ceremony in its fuller form, as prescribed in the
*S*rauta-sûtra.
