### Footnotes

<span id="fn_609"></span>[245:1](sbe29150.htm#fr_610.md) 5, 1. Nârâya*n*a
(comp. the Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya-Pari*s*ish*t*a III, 7) understands this
Sûtra in a different way. 'After the tenth Tithi of the dark fortnight,
on a Tithi with an odd number, is e. on the eleventh, thirteenth, or
fifteenth.' The single Nakshatras are those the name of which does not
denote two Nakshatras (as, for instance, the two Ashâ*dh*âs). Comp.
Kâty.-*S*raut. XXV, 8, 1; Manu V, 59.

without protuberances like female breasts, are considered as female or
