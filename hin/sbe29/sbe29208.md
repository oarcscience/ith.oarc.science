# KHÂDIRA-G*RI*HYA-SÛTRA.

### PA*T*ALA I, KHA*ND*A 1.

1 <span id="fr_966"></span>[1](#fn_965). Now henceforth the domestic
sacrifices (will be explained).

2 <span id="fr_967"></span>[2](#fn_966). During the northern course of
the sun, at the time of the increasing moon, on auspicious days, before
noon: this is the time at which the constellations are lucky, unless a
special statement is given.

3 <span id="fr_968"></span>[3](#fn_967). At the end (of the ceremonies)
he should give to the Brâhma*n*as to eat according to his ability.

4 <span id="fr_969"></span>[4-6](#fn_968). The sacrificial cord is made
of a string or of Ku*s*a grass.

5\. If he suspends it round his neck and raises the right arm (so as to
wear the cord on his left shoulder), he becomes ya*gñ*opavîtin.

6\. (If he raises) the left (arm and wears the cord on his right
shoulder, he becomes) prâ*k*înâvîtin.

7 <span id="fr_970"></span>[7-10](#fn_969). After having sipped water
three times, let him wipe off the water twice.

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

8\. Having besprinkled his feet (with water), let him besprinkle his
head.

9\. Let him touch the organs of his senses (i.e. his eyes, his nose, and
his ears) with water (i.e. with a wet hand).

10\. When he has finally touched (water) again, he becomes pure.

11 <span id="fr_971"></span>[11-14](#fn_970). (If) sitting, standing, or
lying down (is prescribed), he should understand (that it is to be done)
on northward-pointed Darbha grass, with the face turned to the east, to
the west of the fire with which the sacrifice is performed.

12\. If the word Snâna (or bathing) is used, (this refers to the whole
body) with the head.

13\. (The different ceremonies are) performed with the right hand, if no
special rule is given.

14\. If it is not clear where a Mantra ends, one should discern it by
(adverting to) the beginning of the next Mantra.

15 <span id="fr_972"></span>[15](#fn_971). The Mantras have the word
svâhâ at their end, when offerings are made.

16 <span id="fr_973"></span>[16](#fn_972). The term Pâkaya*gñ*a is used
of every sacrifice that is performed with one fire.

17 <span id="fr_974"></span>[17-18](#fn_973). There the Brahman is
(present as) officiating priest, with the exception of the morning and
evening oblations.

8\. pâdâv abhyukshya *s*iro<sup>ऽ</sup>bhyukshed. 9. indriyâ*n*y

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

18\. The Hot*ri*'s place is filled by (the sacrificer) himself.

19 <span id="fr_975"></span>[19](#fn_974). To the south of the fire the
Brahman sits facing the north, silently, until the oblation has been
performed, on eastward-pointed (Darbha grass).

20 <span id="fr_976"></span>[20-22](#fn_975). But if he likes, he may
speak of what refers to the sacrifice.

21\. Or if he has spoken (words) which are unworthy of the sacrifice,
let him murmur the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis,

22\. Or (the verse), 'Thus has Vish*n*u' (Sv. I, 222).

23 <span id="fr_977"></span>[23](#fn_976). If he does himself the work
both of the Brahman and of the Hot*ri*, let him sit down on the
Brahman's seat, and (leave that seat) placing a parasol on it, or an
outer garment, or a water-pot, and then let him perform his other
duties.

24 <span id="fr_978"></span>[24](#fn_977). Let him take care not to turn
his back to, or become separated (by any person or thing interposed)
from what belongs to the sacrifice.
