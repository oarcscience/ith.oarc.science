1 <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_108.md). After ten days the getting up
(of the mother from childbed).

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

2\. Father and mother with washed heads, wearing (new) clothes which
have not yet been washed;

3\. And so also the child.

4 <span id="fr_110"></span>[4](#fn_109). Let (the father.md) cook a mess of
food in that same fire that has been kept from her confinement,

5\. And let him make oblations to the Tithi of (the child's) birth and
to three constellations with their (presiding) deities.

6\. Let him place in the middle the oblation to that constellation under
which (the child) is born; the deity, however, is constantly to precede
(the corresponding Nakshatra).

7 <span id="fr_111"></span>[7](#fn_110.md). (He then makes two other
oblations with the verses,) '(May) this Agni, the excellent one, (give)
thee to-day life for (our) prayers; give us life that we may live
long,'—(and,) 'Life-giving, Agni, be strong by Havis; may thy face and
thy seat be full of ghee; drinking ghee, the sweet honey of the cow,
protect, as a father (protects) his son, here N.N.' The tenth oblation
of the mess of cooked food with the verse, 'Thou, Soma, givest bliss to
the old one' (Rig-veda I, 91, 7).

8\. Having pronounced aloud (the child's) name,

9\. And caused the Brâhma*n*as to say auspicious words,

10\. And having sacrificed in the same way every month to the Tithi of
(the child's) birth,

11 <span id="fr_112"></span>[11](#fn_111.md). He sacrifices, when one year
has expired, on the (ordinary) domestic fire.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_108"></span>[51:1](sbe29027.htm#fr_109.md) 25, 1. After ten
days the impurity (a*s*au*k*a) that falls on the mother at her
confinement, ceases; see Gautama XIV, 16; Manu V, 62; Vasish*th*a IV,
21.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[52:4](sbe29027.htm#fr_110.md) Comp. the note on
chap. 24, 1.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[52:7](sbe29027.htm#fr_111.md) The first Mantra is
corrupt; in the Â*s*valâyana-*S*rauta-sûtra (II, 10, 4) its text runs
thus, âyush *t*e vi*s*vato dadhad ayam agnir vare*n*ya*h*, &c. Comp.
Atharva-veda VII, 53, 6.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[52:11](sbe29027.htm#fr_112.md) 'The words "every
month" (Sûtra 10) retain their value <span id="page_53">p.
53</span>(here also). Thus the sûtikâgni is to be kept through one year.
After the lapse of that year one should sacrifice every month on the
domestic fire as long as his life lasts. As it is said "in the domestic
fire," the sûtikâgni is not to be kept any longer.' Nârâya*n*a.
