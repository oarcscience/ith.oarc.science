### KA*ND*IKÂ 22.

1\. Having tied the girdle round him and given him the staff, he should
impose the (observances of the) Brahma*k*arya on him—

2\. (With the words), 'A Brahma*k*ârin thou art. Eat water. Do the
service. Do not sleep in the day-time. Devoted to the teacher study the
Veda.'

3\. Twelve years lasts the Brahma*k*arya for (each) Veda, or until he
has learnt it.

4\. Let him beg (food) in the evening and in the morning.

5\. Let him put fuel on (the fire) in the evening and in the morning.

6\. Let him beg first of a man who will not refuse,

7\. Or of a woman who will not refuse.

8\. (In begging he should use the words), 'Sir, give food!'

9 <span id="fr_458"></span>[9](#fn_457). Or, '(Sir, give.md)
Anuprava*k*anîya (food).'

10 <span id="fr_459"></span>[10](#fn_458). That (which he has received.md)
he should announce to his teacher.

11\. He should stand the rest of the day.

12 <span id="fr_460"></span>[12](#fn_459). After sunset (the student.md)
should cook the Brâhmaudana (or boiled rice with which the Brâhma*n*as
are to be fed) for the Anuprava*k*anîya sacrifice (the sacrifice to be
performed after a part of the Veda has been studied), and should
announce to the teacher (that it is ready).

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

13\. The teacher should sacrifice, while the student takes hold of him,
with the verse, 'The wonderful lord of the abode' (Rig-Veda I, 18, 6).

14\. A second time with the Sâvitrî—

15 <span id="fr_461"></span>[15](#fn_460.md). And whatever else has been
studied afterwards.

16\. A third time to the *Ri*shis.

17\. A fourth time (the oblation) to (Agni) Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

18 <span id="fr_462"></span>[18](#fn_461.md). Having given food to the
Brâhma*n*as he should cause them to pronounce the end of the Veda
(study).

19\. From that time (the student) should eat no saline food; he should
observe chastity, and should sleep on the ground through three nights,
or twelve nights, or one year.

20 <span id="fr_463"></span>[20](#fn_462.md). When he has fulfilled those
observances, (the teacher) performs (for him) the 'production of
intelligence,' (in the following way):

21 <span id="fr_464"></span>[21](#fn_463). While (the student.md) towards
an unobjectionable direction (of the horizon) sprinkles thrice (water)
from the left to the right with a water-pot round a

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Palâ*s*a (tree)
with one root, or round a Ku*s*a bunch, if there is no Palâ*s*a, (the
teacher) causes him to say, 'O glorious one, thou art glorious. As thou,
O glorious one, art glorious, thus, O glorious one, lead me to glory. As
thou art the preserver of the treasure of sacrifice for the gods, thus
may I become the preserver of the treasure of the Veda for men.'

22 <span id="fr_465"></span>[22](#fn_464.md). Thereby, beginning with his
having the hair cut, and ending with the giving in charge, the imposing
of observances has been declared.

23\. Thus for one who has not been initiated before.

24\. Now as regards one who has been initiated before:

25 <span id="fr_466"></span>[25](#fn_465.md). The cutting of the hair is
optional,

26 <span id="fr_467"></span>[26](#fn_466.md). And the 'production of
intelligence.'

27 <span id="fr_468"></span>[27](#fn_467.md). On the giving in charge there
are no express rules (in this case);

28 <span id="fr_469"></span>[28](#fn_468.md). And on the time.

29 <span id="fr_470"></span>[29](#fn_469). (He should recite to him.md) as
the Sâvitrî (the *Rik*),'That we choose of god Savit*ri*' (Rig-veda V,
82, 1).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_457"></span>[191:9](sbe29121.htm#fr_458.md) 22, 9. Food for
the Anuprava*k*anîya offering; see Sûtra 12.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[191:10](sbe29121.htm#fr_459.md)

<span id="fn_459"></span>[191:12](sbe29121.htm#fr_460.md) 'The student
should, according to the rules for the Pâkaya*gñ*as, cook the
Anuprava*k*anîya food and announce it to the teacher in the words, "The
food is cooked."' Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[192:15](sbe29121.htm#fr_461.md) Nârâya*n*a
mentions as such texts especially those belonging to the Âra*n*yaka,
viz. the Mahânâmnyas, the Mahâvrata, and the Upanishad. But there is no
reason why we should not think quite as well of the Rig-veda Sa*m*hitâ
itself.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[192:18](sbe29121.htm#fr_462.md) 'He should say,
"Sirs! Pronounce the end of the Veda (study)." And they should reply,
"May an end of the Veda (study) be made."' Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[192:20](sbe29121.htm#fr_463.md) Comp. above,
chap. 15, 2.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[192:21](sbe29121.htm#fr_464.md) 'The
objectionable directions are three, the south, the southeast, the
south-west.' Nârâya*n*a.

Su*s*ravas, which I have translated by 'glorious,' at the same time
means, 'endowed with good hearing,' i.e. successful in study. The
student therefore by the same word prays for glory and for success in
Vedic learning.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[193:22](sbe29121.htm#fr_465.md) The rules stated
above for the Upanayana, beginning with the prescription regarding the
cutting of the hair (given chap. 19, so in the words, 'whose \[hair on
the\] head is arranged;' see the note there), and ending with the
ceremony prescribed chap. 20, 8, are to be extended also to other cases
of the imposing of a vow, such, for instance, as that mentioned chap.
18, 9.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[193:25](sbe29121.htm#fr_466.md) See chap. 79, 10.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[193:26](sbe29121.htm#fr_467.md) See above, Sûtra
20.

<span id="fn_467"></span>[193:27](sbe29121.htm#fr_468.md) See chap. 20, 8.

<span id="fn_468"></span>[193:28](sbe29121.htm#fr_469.md) See chap. 4, 1.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[193:29](sbe29121.htm#fr_470.md) Instead of the
ordinary Sâvitrî, Rig-veda III, 62, 10.
