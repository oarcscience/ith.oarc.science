### KA*ND*IKÂ 17.

1 <span id="fr_859"></span>[1](#fn_858). Now (follows.md) the sacrifice to
Sîtâ.

2\. Wherever he sacrifices, be it (on a field) of rice or of barley, of
that grain he should prepare a mess of cooked food.

3 <span id="fr_860"></span>[3](#fn_859.md). One who has sacrificed may, if
he likes, prepare elsewhere also a mess of cooked food, either of rice
or of barley.

4 <span id="fr_861"></span>[4](#fn_860). (There should be.md) no doubt (as
to whether rice or barley is to be taken), as a rule thereon has been
stated above.

5\. If it is impossible (to take one of the two species of corn), (that)
is excluded.

6\. To the east or to the north of the field, on a

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

clean spot that has been ploughed, so that the crop he not damaged,

7\. Or in the village, because (there) both (rice and barley) are
united, and because no obstacle is there.

8\. Where he intends to cook (the sacrificial food), he establishes the
fire on a place that has been smeared (with cowdung), which is elevated,
and which has been sprinkled (with water), strews (round the fire)
Darbha grass mixed with (stalks of) that (sort of corn to which the
sacrifice refers), sacrifices the two Â*g*ya portions and Â*g*ya
oblations (with the following Mantras):

9\. 'For whom earth and heaven, the intermediate points and the chief
points (of the horizon) are veiled with light, that Indra I invoke here.
May his weapons be friendly towards us. Svâhâ!

'Whatsoever it be that I wish for at this sacrifice, O killer of
V*ri*tra, may all that be fulfilled to me, and may I live a hundred
autumns. Svâhâ!

'May success, prosperity, earth, rain, eminence, excellence, luck here
protect the creatures. Svâhâ!

'In whose substance dwells the prosperity of all Vedic and worldly
works, Indra's wife Sîtâ I invoke. May she not abandon me in whatever
work I do. Svâhâ!

Her, who rich in horses, rich in cows, rich in delight indefatigably
supports living beings, Urvarâ (i.e. the field) who is wreathed with
threshing-floors, I invoke at this sacrifice, the firm One. May she not
abandon me. Svâhâ!

10\. He makes oblations of the cooked sacrificial food to Sîtâ, Ya*g*â
(the goddess of sacrifice), *S*amâ (the goddess of zealous devotion),
Bhûti (the goddess of welfare).

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

11\. Some say that the giving (of the sacrificial food to the deities)
accompanies the Mantras.

12 <span id="fr_862"></span>[12](#fn_861.md). But this is excluded, as the
*S*ruti says, 'The giving (of the oblation to the deity) accompanies the
word Svâhâ.'

13\. On the Ku*s*a grass which is left over from the strewing (of grass
round the fire), he offers a Bali to the protecting demons of the furrow
with (the Mantra), 'They who are sitting towards the east with strong
bows and quivers, may they protect thee from the east, and be vigilant
and not abandon thee. To them I bring adoration, and I offer this Bali
to them.'

14 <span id="fr_863"></span>[14](#fn_862.md). Then to the south with (the
Mantra), 'They who are sitting towards the south, not winking the eyes,
wearing armour, may they protect thee from the south, and be vigilant
and not abandon thee. To them I bring adoration, and I offer this Bali
to them.'

15 <span id="fr_864"></span>[15](#fn_863.md). Then to the west with (the
Mantra), 'The powerful ones, the excellent ones, prosperity, earth,
Pârsh*n*i, *S*una*m*kuri, may they protect thee from the west, and be
vigilant and not abandon thee. To them I bring adoration, and I offer
this Bali to them.'

16\. Then to the north with (the Mantra), 'The fearful ones, like to
Vâyu in speed, may they protect

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

thee from the north, on the field, on the threshing-floor, in the house,
on the way, and be vigilant and not abandon thee. To them I bring
adoration, and I offer this Bali to them.'

17 <span id="fr_865"></span>[17](#fn_864). Of another (sort of food.md) as
the chief (food used at this sacrifice), and with the remainder of
Â*g*ya, he distributes Balis as above.

18\. And the women should make accompanying oblations, because such is
the custom.

19\. When the ceremony is finished, he should feed the Brâhma*n*as. He
should feed the Brâhma*n*as.

End of the Second Kâ*nd*a.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_858"></span>[333:1](sbe29190.htm#fr_859.md) 17, 1. The goddess
Sîtâ is, as her name indicates, the rustic deity of the furrow.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[333:3](sbe29190.htm#fr_860.md) Perhaps the
meaning is that a person who has already once performed the Sîtâ-ya*gñ*a
on the field, is allowed, when repeating the sacrifice another time, to
celebrate it elsewhere, and to choose at his will between rice and
barley.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[333:4](sbe29190.htm#fr_861.md) A rule has been
given in the *S*rauta-sûtra (Kâty. I, 9, 1: 'Rice or barley, if a Havis
\[is prescribed\]') which shows that it is indifferent whether rice or
barley is taken. Thus the sacrificer is free to elect the one or the
other. At least this is the traditional meaning of this Sûtra. But
possibly we had better understand it otherwise. The sacrificer should
offer, according to Sûtra 3, rice or barley. Whether he has to take the
one or the other, there can be no doubt, as the rule given above (Sûtra
2) shows that rice should be cooked, if the ceremony is performed for a
rice-field, and barley, if for a barley-field.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[335:12](sbe29190.htm#fr_862.md) The quotation has
not been as yet identified in the *S*ruti itself, but the words quoted
are found in Kâty.-*S*raut. I, 2, 7.

<span id="fn_862"></span>[335:14](sbe29190.htm#fr_863.md) Some words in the
beginning of the Mantra are lost. We should probably write: atha
dakshi*n*ata*h*. ye dakshi*n*ato<sup>ऽ</sup>nimishâ*h* . . . varmi*n*a
âsate, &c. Of course it is impossible to say which is the word that is
wanting before (or perhaps after) varmi*n*a*h*.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[335:15](sbe29190.htm#fr_864.md) Pârsh*n*i, which
means 'heel,' stands here, of course, as the name of a protecting demon.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[336:17](sbe29190.htm#fr_865.md) See above, chap.
13, 2.
