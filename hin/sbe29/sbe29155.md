1 <span id="fr_663"></span>[1](#fn_662) Now henceforth the performance
of the domestic sacrifices of cooked food (will be explained).

2 <span id="fr_664"></span>[2](#fn_663). Having wiped (around the
surface on which he intends to perform a sacrifice), having besmeared it
(with cowdung), having drawn the lines thereon, having taken the earth
out (of the lines), having besprinkled (the place with water), having
established the (sacred) fire, having spread out the seat for the
Brahman to the south, having carried forward (the Pra*n*îta water),
having spread (Ku*s*a grass) round (the fire), having put down (the
different things used at the sacrifice) according as they are wanted,
having prepared two (Ku*s*a blades used as) strainers, having
consecrated the Proksha*n*î

water, having sprinkled (with that water the sacrificial implements)
according to what is needed, having poured out (the Â*g*ya or
sacrificial butter into the pot), and having put the sacrificial butter
on the fire, he should (lustrate the butter by) moving a fire-brand
round it.

3\. Having warmed the (sacrificial spoon called) Sruva, having wiped it,
having besprinkled it (with water), and warmed it again, he should put
it down.

4 <span id="fr_665"></span>[4](#fn_664). Having taken the Â*g*ya from
the fire, having purified it, having looked at it, and (having purified)
the Proksha*n*î water as above, having taken up the Ku*s*a blades with
which he is to take hold (of the Â*g*ya pot) by its under surface,
having put pieces of wood on (the fire), and having sprinkled (water
round it), he should sacrifice.

5\. This is the rite wherever a sacrifice is performed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_662"></span>[269:1](sbe29155.htm#fr_663) 1, 1. Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 1; Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I, 1, &c. It seems to
me that Professor Stenzler is not quite right in giving to the opening
words of the text athâta*h*, which he translates 'nun also,' the
explanation: 'das heisst, nach Beendigung des *S*rauta-sûtra von
Kâtyâyana.' I think rather it can be shown that ata*h* does not contain
a reference to something preceding; thus the *S*rauta-sûtra, which forms
the first part of the whole Sûtra collection, is opened in the same way
by the words athâto<sup>ऽ</sup>dhikâra*h*.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[269:2](sbe29155.htm#fr_664) The description of
the standard form of domestic sacrifice opens with an enumeration of the
five so-called bhûsa*m*skâra (parisamuhya, &c.). On the samûhana (for
parisamuhya is derived <span id="page_270">p. 270</span> from the root
ûh, not from vah; comp. below, II, 4, 2: pâ*n*inâgnim parisamûhati), see
*S*âṅkhâyana I, 7, 11; G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha-pari*s*ish*t*a I, 37, &c. On
the lines drawn on the sacrificial surface, see *S*âṅkhâyana I, 7, 6
seq.; Â*s*valâyana I, 3, 1; G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha-pari*s*ish*t*a I, 47
seq.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[270:4](sbe29155.htm#fr_665) Pûrvavat ('as
above') can possibly, as Professor Stenzler understands it, have been
said with regard to Kâtyâyana's rule, II, 3, 33: Tâbhyâm (scil.
pavitrâbhyâm) utpunâti Savitur va iti. But it is also possible that the
expression may refer to the second Sûtra of this chapter, where it is
said, proksha*n*î*h* sa*m*sk*ri*tya. On upayamanân ku*s*ân, comp.
Kâtyâyana I, 10, 6-8.
