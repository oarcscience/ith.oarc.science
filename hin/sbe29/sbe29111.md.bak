### KA*ND*IKÂ 12.

1 <span id="fr_431"></span>[1](#fn_430.md). At a *K*aitya sacrifice he
should before the Svish*t*ak*ri*t (offering) offer a Bali to the
*K*aitya.

2 <span id="fr_432"></span>[2](#fn_431). If, however, (the *K*aitya.md) is
distant, (he should send his Bali) through a leaf-messenger.

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

3 <span id="fr_433"></span>[3](#fn_432.md). With the *Rik*, 'Where thou
knowest, O tree' (Rig-veda V, 5, 10), let him make two lumps (of food),
put them on a carrying-pole, hand them over to the messenger, and say to
him, 'Carry this Bali to that (*K*aitya).'

4\. (He gives him the lump) which is destined for the messenger, with
(the words), 'This to thee.'

5\. If there is anything dangerous between (them and the *K*aitya), (he
gives him) some weapon also.

6 <span id="fr_434"></span>[6](#fn_433.md). If a navigable river is between
(them and the *K*aitya, he gives him) also something like a raft with
(the words), 'Hereby thou shalt cross.'

7 <span id="fr_435"></span>[7](#fn_434.md). At the Dhanvantari sacrifice
let him offer first a Bali to the Purohita, between the Brahman and the
fire.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_430"></span>[178:1](sbe29111.htm#fr_431.md) 12, 1. There seems
to be no doubt that Professor Stenzler is right in giving to *k*aitya in
this chapter its ordinary meaning of religious shrine ('Denkmal'). The
text shows that the Kaitya sacrifice was not offered like other
sacrifices at the sacrificer's home, but that in some cases the offering
would have to be sent, at least symbolically, to distant places. This
confirms Professor Stenzler's translation of *k*aitya. Nârâya*n*a 
explains *k*aitya by *k*itte bhava, and says, 'If he makes a vow to a
certain deity, saying, "If I obtain such and such a desire, I shall
offer to thee an Â*g*ya sacrifice, or a Sthâlîpâka, or an animal"—and if
he then obtains what he had wished for and 'performs that sacrifice to
that deity: this is a *k*aitya sacrifice.' I do not know anything that
supports this statement as to the meaning of *k*aitya.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[178:2](sbe29111.htm#fr_432.md) 'He should make of
a leaf a messenger and a carrying-pole.' Nârâya*n*a.

It is not clear whether besides this image of a messenger there was also
a real messenger who had to carry the Bali to the *K*aitya, <span
id="page_179">p. 179</span> or whether the whole rite was purely
symbolical, and based on the principle: In sacris ficta pro veris
accipiuntur.
