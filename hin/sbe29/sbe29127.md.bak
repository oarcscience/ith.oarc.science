### KA*ND*IKÂ 4.

1 <span id="fr_497"></span>[1](#fn_496.md). On the eighth days of the four
dark fortnights of (the two seasons of) winter and *S*i*s*ira the
Ash*t*akâs (are celebrated).

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

2 <span id="fr_498"></span>[2](#fn_497). Or on one (of these days.md).

3\. The day before, he should offer to the Fathers (i.e. Manes)—

4\. Boiled rice, boiled rice with sesamum seeds, rice-milk—

5\. Or cakes made of four *S*arâvas (of ground grain)—

6\. Sacrificing with the eight (verses), 'May the lower (Fathers) and
the higher arise' (Rig-veda X, 15, 1 seqq.), or with as many (verses) as
he likes.

7 <span id="fr_499"></span>[7](#fn_498.md). Then on the next day the
Ash*t*akâs (are celebrated) with an animal (sacrifice) and with a mess
of cooked food.

8\. He may also give grass to an ox,

9\. Or he may burn down brushwood with fire—

10\. With (the words), 'This is my Ash*t*akâ.'

11\. But he should not omit celebrating the Ash*t*akâ.

12\. This (Ash*t*akâ) some state to be sacred to the Vi*s*ve devâs, some
to Agni, some to the Sun, some to Pra*g*âpati, some state that the Night
is its deity, some that the Nakshatras are, some that the Seasons are,
some that the Fathers are, some that cattle is.

13 <span id="fr_500"></span>[13](#fn_499.md). Having killed the animal
according to the

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

ritual of the animal sacrifice, omitting the sprinkling (with water) and
the touching of the animal with a fresh branch, he should draw out the
omentum and sacrifice it with (the verse), 'Carry the omentum,
*G*âtavedas, to the Fathers, where thou knowest them resting afar. May
streams of fat flow to them; may all these wishes be fulfilled. Svâhâ!'

14 <span id="fr_501"></span>[14](#fn_500). Then (follow oblations.md) of
the Avadâna portions and the cooked food, two with (the two verses),
'Agni, lead us on a good path to wealth' (Rig-veda I, 189, 1 seq.), (and
other oblations with the texts), 'May summer, winter, the seasons be
happy to us, happy the rainy season, safe to us the autumn. The year be
our lord who gives breath to us; may days and nights produce long life.
Svâhâ!

'Peaceful be the earth, happy the air, may the goddess Heaven give us
safety. Happy be the quarters (of the horizon), the intermediate
quarters, the upper quarters; may the waters, the lightnings protect us
from all sides. Svâhâ!

'May the waters, the rays carry our prayers (to the gods); may the
creator, may the ocean turn away evil; may the past and the future,
(may) all be safe to me. Protected by Brahman may I pour forth songs.
Svâhâ!

'May all the Âdityas and the divine Vasus, the Rudras, the protectors,
the Maruts sit down (here). May Pra*g*âpati, the abounding one, the
highest ruler, bestow vigour, offspring, immortality on me. Svâhâ!

'Pra*g*âpati, no other one than Thou (Rig-veda X, 121, 10).'

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

15\. The eighth (oblation) is that to (Agni) Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

16 <span id="fr_502"></span>[16](#fn_501.md). He should give to the
Brâhma*n*as to eat: this has been said.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_496"></span>[205:1](sbe29127.htm#fr_497.md) 4, 1. Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya III, 12 seqq. The four <span id="page_206">p.
206</span> months of Hemanta and *S*i*s*ira are Mârga*s*îrsha, Pausha,
Mâgha, and Phâlguna.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[206:2](sbe29127.htm#fr_498.md) The statement of
the Prayogaratna that in case the sacrificer should celebrate only one
Ash*t*akâ festival, the Ash*t*akâ of the Mâgha month is to be selected,
well agrees with the designation of this Ash*t*akâ as 'the one
Ash*t*akâ' (ekâsh*t*akâ); see Weber, Naxatra II, 341 seq.; Indische
Studien, XV, 145.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[206:7](sbe29127.htm#fr_499.md) 7 seqq. Comp. the
nearly identical passage in *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya III, 14, 3 seqq. and
the note there. Â*s*valâyana evidently gives these rules not as
regarding one special Ash*t*akâ but all of them.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[206:13](sbe29127.htm#fr_500.md) Comp. above, I,
11, 1. 2. 10. As to the Mantra, comp. *S*âṅkhâyana III, 13, 3.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[207:14](sbe29127.htm#fr_501.md) I read, as Prof.
Stenzler and the Petersburg Dictionary do, svârâ ksharâ*n*i. Comp.
Pâraskara III, 3, 6.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[208:16](sbe29127.htm#fr_502.md) See above, chap.
3, 13.
