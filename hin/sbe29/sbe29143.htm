But a comparison of <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya II, 18 seems to make it probable that the ceremony described here has nothing to do with the Sam&acirc;vartana.</p>  
<p>I take this chapter rather for a description of the way in which a student has to take leave of his teacher when setting out on a journey. 'His name' is the teacher's name, according to N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a.</P>
