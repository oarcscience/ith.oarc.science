*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 4.

1\. He gives order, 'Light the fires together.'

2 <span id="fr_598"></span>[2](#fn_597.md). If the Âhavanîya fire reaches
(the body) first, he should know, 'It has reached him in the
heaven-world. He will live there in prosperity, and so will this one,
i.e. his son, in this world.'

3 <span id="fr_599"></span>[3](#fn_598.md). If the Gârhapatya fire reaches
(the body) first, he should know, 'It has reached him in the air-world.
He will live there in prosperity, and so will this one, i.e. his son, in
this world.'

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

4 <span id="fr_600"></span>[4](#fn_599.md). If the Dakshi*n*a fire reaches
(the body) first, he should know, 'It has reached him in the world of
men. He will live there in prosperity, and so will this one, i.e. his
son, in this world.'

5 <span id="fr_601"></span>[5](#fn_600). If (the three fires.md) reach (the
body) in the same moment, they say that this signifies the highest luck.

6 <span id="fr_602"></span>[6](#fn_601). While (the body.md) is burning, he
recites over it the same texts, 'Go on, go on, on the ancient paths'
(Rig-veda X, 14, 7).

7\. Being burnt by a person who knows this, he goes to the heaven-world
together with the smoke (of the funeral pile)—thus it is understood (in
the *S*ruti).

8 <span id="fr_603"></span>[8](#fn_602.md). To the north-east of the
Âhavanîya fire he should have a knee-deep pit dug and should have an
Avakâ, i.e. (the water-plant called) *S*îpâla put down into it. From
that (pit) he (i.e. the deceased) goes out and together with the smoke
he goes up to the heaven-world—thus it is understood (in the *S*ruti).

9\. After he has recited (the verse), 'These living ones have separated
from the dead' (Rig-veda X, 18, 3), they turn round from right to left
and go away without looking back.

10 <span id="fr_604"></span>[10](#fn_603.md). When they have come to a
place where standing water is, having once (plunged into it and) emerged

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

from it, they pour out one handful (of water), pronounce the Gotra name
and the proper name (of the deceased), go out (of the water), put on
other garments, wring out (the old garments) once, lay them away with
their skirts to the north, and sit down until the stars appear.

11\. Or they may enter (their houses), when still (a part) of the
sun-disk is seen,

12 <span id="fr_605"></span>[12](#fn_604.md). The younger ones first, the
older ones last.

13\. When they have come to the houses, they touch a stone, the fire,
cow's dung, fried barley, sesamum seeds, and water.

14\. Let them not cook food during that night.

15 <span id="fr_606"></span>[15](#fn_605.md). Let them subsist on bought or
ready-made food.

16\. Let them eat no saline food for three nights.

17 <span id="fr_607"></span>[17](#fn_606.md). Let them optionally for
twelve nights avoid the distribution of gifts and the study (of Vedic
texts), if one of the chief Gurus (has died).

18 <span id="fr_608"></span>[18](#fn_607). Ten days after (the death of.md)
Sapi*nd*as,

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

19\. And of a Guru who is no Sapi*nd*a,

20\. And of unmarried female relations.

21 <span id="fr_609"></span>[21](#fn_608.md). Three nights after (the death
of) other teachers,

22\. And of a relation who is no Sapi*nd*a,

23\. And of married female relations,

24\. Of a child that has no teeth,

25\. And of a dead-born child.

26\. One day, after (the death of) a fellow-pupil,

27\. And of a *S*rotriya of the same village.

means that the texts indicated in the *S*rauta-sûtra VI, 10, 19
(twenty-four verses taken from the hymns X, 14, 16, 17, 18, 154) have to
be recited.

mother and the teacher who, after having performed the Upanayana for
him, has taught him the whole Veda, are the chief Gurus. When these have
died, they should avoid giving gifts and studying the Veda either for
twelve nights, or for ten nights, this rule standing in correlation with
the following one.' Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[244:18](sbe29149.htm#fr_608.md) The Sapi*nd*a
relationship is generally defined as the relationship within six

60; Gautama XIV, 13 (with Prof. Bühler's note, Sacred Books, vol. ii, p.
