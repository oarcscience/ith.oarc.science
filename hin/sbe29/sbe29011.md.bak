### KHA*ND*A 9.

1 <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_53). The Sruva spoon (serves as.md) a
vessel.

2\. According to the purpose the properties (of the different things to
be used at each oblation) should be chosen.

3 <span id="fr_55"></span>[3](#fn_54.md). Taking up Ku*s*a blades with the
left, and the

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sruva at its
bottom with the right hand, with the words, 'The hand of Vish*n*u art
thou'—

4 <span id="fr_56"></span>[4](#fn_55.md). He offers with the Sruva the
Â*g*ya oblations.

5 <span id="fr_57"></span>[5](#fn_56.md). Beginning from the north-west
side of the fire he offers (the Â*g*ya) unintermittingly on the south
side (of the fire) with (the verse), 'Thou Agni art full of foresight'
(Rig-veda I, 31, 10).

6\. Beginning from the south-west side of the fire he unintermittingly
offers on the north side with (the verse), 'To whom these snowy
mountains' (Rig-veda X, 121, 4).

7\. To Agni belongs the northern Â*g*ya portion, to Soma the southern.

8 <span id="fr_58"></span>[8](#fn_57). In the middle (are made.md) the
other oblations,

9\. (With the words,) 'Agni is the begetter; may he give to me N.N. as
my wife; svâhâ!

'Soma is rich in wives; may he make me rich in wives by N.N.; svâhâ!

'Pûshan is rich in kindred; may he make me rich in kindred by the
father, the mother, the brothers of N.N.; svâhâ!'

10 <span id="fr_59"></span>[10](#fn_58.md). At the Â*g*ya oblations the
offering of the two Â*g*ya portions and of the Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation
is not standing,

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

11 <span id="fr_60"></span>[11](#fn_59.md). Nor in the standing oblations,
according to Mâ*nd*ûkeya.

12 <span id="fr_61"></span>[12](#fn_60.md). The place for the insertion is
the interval between the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis, the general expiation, and the
oblation to Pra*g*âpati.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

13\. If the oblation consists in Â*g*ya, let him seize the Ku*s*a blades
in his left hand with his right hand at their points and with the left
at their roots, and let him wet their points (with Â*g*ya) in the Sruva,
the middle and the roots in the Â*g*ya pot;

14\. In the oblations of cooked food, however, the points in the Sru*k*,
the middle in the Sruva, the roots in the Â*g*ya pot.

15\. When he then has thrown them (into the fire) with the words,
'Agni's garment art thou,'

16\. And has put on (the fire) three pieces of wood,

17 <span id="fr_62"></span>[17](#fn_61). (Water.md) is sprinkled round (the
fire) as stated above.

18\. Oblations for which only the deities are indicated, but no texts
prescribed, are to be made merely with the word SVÂHÂ, 'To such and such
a deity svâhâ! To such and such a deity svâhâ!'

19 <span id="fr_63"></span>[19](#fn_62). The ritual (here.md) declared of
the sacrifice (to

be performed) when (the father's) assent (to give away his daughter) has
been declared—

<span id="fn_53"></span>[26:1](sbe29011.htm#fr_54.md) 9, 1. 'When no
special rule is stated, the Sruva is to be understood as the vessel (for
the offering). Thereby the rule, "The *G*uhû is the vessel"
(*S*rauta-sûtra III, 19, 5) is abolished (for the G*ri*hya rites).'
Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[26:3](sbe29011.htm#fr_55.md) The manner of holding
the Sruva in which the Â*g*ya is, is described by Kâtyâyana, *S*raut. I,
10, 6 seq., Stenzler's note on Pâraskara I, 1, 4.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[27:4](sbe29011.htm#fr_56.md) As to the
characteristics of Â*g*ya (sacrificial butter), which is the substance
offered at most of the G*ri*hya sacrifices, comp the statements of the
G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha-pari*s*ish*t*a I, 105 seq.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[27:5](sbe29011.htm#fr_57.md) Avi*kkh*inna*m*
(unintermittingly) is explained in Nâr.'s commentary by ekadhârayâ.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[27:8](sbe29011.htm#fr_58.md) 8 seq. Here are
indicated the chief oblations of this sacrifice (anyâ âhutaya*h*
pradhânabhûtâ*h*, Nâr.), or the âvâpa (the insertion, Sûtra 12) which
comes between the standing introductory and concluding oblations.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[27:10](sbe29011.htm#fr_59.md) On Svish*t*ak*ri*t,
comp. Weber, Indische Studien, IX, 217.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[28:11](sbe29011.htm#fr_60.md) See chap. 8, 13.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[28:12](sbe29011.htm#fr_61.md) This Sûtra
prescribes where the âvâpa, i.e. the special characteristical offerings
of each sacrifice, is to be inserted between the regular offerings that
belong to the standing model. The same subject is treated of in the
*S*rauta-sûtra in the two rules, I, 16, 3 and 4: 'Whatsoever is offered
between the two Â*g*ya portions and the Svish*t*ak*ri*t, that is called
âvâpa; this is the chief part (pradhâna) (of the sacrifice); the other
(oblations) are subordinate thereto (tadaṅgâni).' The position of the
âvâpa among the other oblations is indicated by Pâraskara in the
following rule (I, 5, 6): Between the general expiation and the oblation
to Pra*g*âpati, this is the place for the âvâpa.' (The word vivâhe at
the end of this Sûtra seems to me to belong not to this rule, but to
Sûtra 7.) Our Sûtra is identical with that of Pâraskara word for word;
only instead of sarvaprâya*sk*itta, as Pâraskara has, we read here,
mahâvyâh*ri*tisarvaprâya*sk*itta. This means, I believe, that the âvâpa,
preceded and followed by the Mahâvyâh*ri*ti oblations (comp. below, I,
12, 13), should be placed between the Sarvaprâya*sk*itta and the
Prâ*g*âpatya oblation. The oblations made with the Mahâvyâh*ri*tayas are
four in number; the corresponding formulas are: bhû*h* svâhâ, bhuva*h*
svâhâ, svâ*h* svâhâ, bhûr bhuva*h* sva*h* svâhâ (comp. below, chap. 12,
12). The Sarvaprâya*sk*itta (general expiation) consists of two
oblations, one with the three Mahâvyâh*ri*tayas, the other with the
verse ayâ*s* *k*âgne, quoted in the *S*rauta-sûtra III, 19, 3, and in
Â*s*valâyana's *S*rauta-sûtra I, 11, 13. (On the Sarvaprâya*sk*itta in
the *S*rauta ritual, compare Hillebrandt, Neu- und Vollmondsopfer, p.
166.) The Prâ*g*âpatya oblation is performed with the formula
Pra*g*âpataye svâhâ. The discussions of Nârâya*n*a on this Sûtra (see p.
125 of the German edition) evidently fail to bring out the true meaning
of the text; according to this commentator the oblations follow each
other in this order: the two Â*g*yabhâgas, the principal oblations
(pradhânâhutaya*h*), the Svish*t*ak*ri*t, the four Mahâvyâh*ri*ti
oblations, the two Sarvaprâya*sk*itta oblations, the Prâ*g*âpatya
oblation. Finally we may mention the corrupt form in which the
corresponding passage of the *S*âmbavya-sûtra is preserved <span
id="page_29">p. 29</span> in the MS. There the two Sûtras 10 and 11 are
placed before the Mantra in Sûtra 9. This Mantra then is given down to
svâheti, then follows â*g*yena, which seems to me to form part of the
same Sûtra, and to refer to the oblations to which the Mantra belongs.
Then the MS. goes on: mahâvyâh*ri*tishu sarvaprâya*sk*ittâra*m* (sic)
etad âvâpasthâna*m* â*g*yahavishi vyâh*ri*tishu sarvaprâya*sk*ittâra*m*
(the syllables prâya*sk*ittâra*m* seem to be expunged) svish*t*ak*ri*to
sthâlîpâke. In the commentary I find the following *S*lokas, which I
give exactly as they are read in the MS.: tis*rin*â*m* vyâh*ri*tinâ*m*
*k*a prâya*sk*ittâhutîr api yad antara*m* tad âpâpâsthâna*m*
sarpi*h*pradhânake. sthâlîpâke vyâh*ri*tinâ*m* yat tat
svish*t*ak*ri*tottara*m* âhutînâ*m* pradhânânâ*m*
nânâdaivata*kh*andasâ*m* yas tu kâlas tad âvâpasthânam itâ*k*yate
budhai*h* tatas tat ta*m* ma ârabhya prâya*sk*ittâhuti*h* kramât.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[29:17](sbe29011.htm#fr_62.md) See above, chap. 8,
17.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[29:19](sbe29011.htm#fr_63.md) This Sûtra, though
reckoned in the Indian tradition to <span id="page_30">p. 30</span>
chap. 9, seems to me clearly to belong to the next chapter, and to
contain the subject, to which the predicate is given in 10, 1. For
prati*s*rute, see chap. 7, 1.
