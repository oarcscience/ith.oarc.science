### KA*ND*IKÂ 8.

1 <span id="fr_640"></span>[1](#fn_639.md). Now the spit-ox (sacrificed to
Rudra).

2\. In autumn or in spring, under the (Nakshatra) Ârdrâ.

3\. The best of his herd,

4\. (An ox) which is neither leprous nor speckled;

5 <span id="fr_641"></span>[5](#fn_640.md). One with black spots, according
to some;

6\. If he likes, a black one, if its colour inclines to copper-colour.

7\. He sprinkles it with water, into which he has thrown rice and
barley,

8\. From head to tail,

9\. With (the formula), 'Grow up, agreeable to Rudra the great god.'

10 <span id="fr_642"></span>[10](#fn_641.md). He should let it grow up.
When it has cut its teeth, or when it has become a bull—

11 <span id="fr_643"></span>[11](#fn_642). To a quarter (of the horizon.md)
which is sacrificially pure,

12\. At a place which cannot be seen from the village,

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

13\. After midnight,

14\. According to some, after sunrise.

15 <span id="fr_644"></span>[15](#fn_643.md). Having caused a Brahman who
is versed in learning and knows the practice (of this sacrifice), to sit
down, having driven a fresh branch with leaves into the ground as a
sacrificial post, (having taken) two creeping plants or two Ku*s*a ropes
as two girdles, and having wound the one round the sacrificial post, and
tied the other round the middle of the animal's head, he binds it to the
sacrificial post or to the girdle (which he had tied to that post) with
(the formula), 'Agreeable to him to whom adoration (is brought), I bind
thee.'

16 <span id="fr_645"></span>[16](#fn_644.md). The sprinkling with water and
what follows is the same as at the animal sacrifice.

17\. We shall state what is different.

18\. Let him sacrifice the omentum with the Pâtrî or with a leaf—thus it
is understood (in the *S*ruti)—

19\. With (the formulas), 'To Hara, M*rid*a, *S*arva, *S*iva, Bhava,
Mahâdeva, Ugra, Bhîma, Pa*s*upati, Rudra, *S*aṅkara, Î*s*âna svâhâ!'

20\. Or with the last six (parts of that formula),

21\. Or with (the formula), 'To Rudra svâhâ!'

22 <span id="fr_646"></span>[22](#fn_645.md). Let him make Bali offerings
towards the four quarters (of the horizon), to each on four rings of
Ku*s*a net-work, with (the formulas), 'The hosts, Rudra, which thou hast
towards the eastern direction,

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

to them this (offering is brought). Adoration to thee! Do no harm to
me!' In this way the assigning (of the offerings is performed) according
to the different quarters (of the horizon).

23\. With the following four hymns he should worship the four quarters,
viz. 'What shall we to Rudra,' 'These prayers to Rudra,' 'To thee, O
father,' 'These songs to Rudra with the strong bow' (Rig-veda I, 43,
114; II, 33; VII, 46).

24\. (This) worship to the quarters (of the horizon) (is performed) at
all sacrifices to Rudra.

25\. The husks and chaff (of the rice), the tail, the skin, the head,
the feet (of the sacrificial animal) he should throw into the fire.

26 <span id="fr_647"></span>[26](#fn_646.md). He should turn the skin to
some use, according to *S*â*m*vatya.

27 <span id="fr_648"></span>[27](#fn_647.md). To the north of the fire, on
rows of Darbha grass, or on rings of Ku*s*a net-work, he should pour out
the blood (of the sacrificial animal) with (the formula), 'Hissing ones!
Noisy ones! Searching ones! Seizing ones! Serpents! What here belongs to
you, take that.'

28\. Then, turning to the north, (he assigns it) to the serpents (in the
words), 'Hissing ones! Noisy ones! Searching ones! Seizing ones!
Serpents! What here belongs to you, take that.'

Then the serpents take whatever has flowed down there of blood or of the
contents of stomach and entrails.

29\. All names, all hosts, all exaltations belong

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

to him;—to a sacrificer who knows that, he gives joy.

30\. Even to a man who only with words sets forth (some part) of that
(ceremony), he will do no harm; thus it is understood (in the *S*ruti).

31\. He should not partake of that (sacrifice).

32 <span id="fr_649"></span>[32](#fn_648.md). They should not take anything
belonging to it into the village. For this god will do harm to (human)
creatures.

33\. He should keep away his people from the vicinity (of the place
where he has sacrificed).

34\. On an express injunction, however, he should partake (of that
sacrificial food), for it will bring luck.

35\. This spit-ox sacrifice procures wealth, (open) space, purity, sons,
cattle, long life, splendour.

36 <span id="fr_650"></span>[36](#fn_649.md). After he has sacrificed, he
should let loose another (animal).

37\. He should not be without such an animal.

38\. Then he will not be without cattle—thus it is understood (in the
*S*ruti).

39 <span id="fr_651"></span>[39](#fn_650.md). Muttering the *S*antâtîya
hymn, he should go to his house.

40\. If disease befalls his cattle, he should sacrifice to that same god
in the midst of his cow-stable—

41\. A mess of cooked food, which he sacrifices in its entirety.

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

42\. Having thrown the sacrificial grass and the Â*g*ya into the fire,
he should lead his cows through the smoke.

43\. Murmuring the *S*antâtîya hymn, he should go in the midst of his
cattle.

44\. Adoration to *S*aunaka! Adoration to *S*aunaka!

End of the Fourth Adhyâya.

End of the Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya-sûtra.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_639"></span>[255:1](sbe29153.htm#fr_640.md) 8, 1. According to
Nârâya*n*a, the 'spit-ox' sacrifice is so called because it is offered
to Rudra the spit-wearer.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[255:5](sbe29153.htm#fr_641.md) Kalmâsho nâma
k*ri*sh*n*abindu*k*ita*h*. Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[255:10](sbe29153.htm#fr_642.md) This Sûtra should
rather be divided into two.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[255:11](sbe29153.htm#fr_643.md) I.e. to the east
or the north.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[256:15](sbe29153.htm#fr_644.md) Round the middle
of the head means, between the two horns. Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[256:16](sbe29153.htm#fr_645.md) See above, I, 11.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[256:22](sbe29153.htm#fr_646.md) This Bali
offering is performed, according to Nârâya*n*a, before the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation of the chief sacrifice. On ku*s*asûna the
commentator has the note, 'Darbhastambais t*rin*ai*s* *k*a kalpavad (or
rather, as Prof. Stenzler writes, ka*t*akavad) grathitvâ sarveshâm
agra*m* g*ri*hîtvâ, ekîk*ri*tya grathitâ*h* ku*s*asûnâ u*k*yante.'

<span id="fn_646"></span>[257:26](sbe29153.htm#fr_647.md) Perhaps
Sâ*m*vatya is a mis-spelling of the name of the well-known G*ri*hya
teacher *S*âmbavya.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[257:27](sbe29153.htm#fr_648.md) Darbhavîtâ is
explained in the commentary by darbharâ*g*i.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[258:32](sbe29153.htm#fr_649.md) Instead of
abhimâruka we ought to read abhimânuka. See Aitareya Brâhma*n*a III, 34,
and the Petersburg Dictionary s. v. abhimânuka.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[258:36](sbe29153.htm#fr_650.md) He should destine
another young animal in the way stated above (Sûtras 7 seqq.) to a new
*S*ûlagava sacrifice.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[258:39](sbe29153.htm#fr_651.md) Rig-veda VII, 35.
Comp. above, II, 8, 11.
