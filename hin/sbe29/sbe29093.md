### ADHYÂYA VI, KHA*ND*A 1.

1 <span id="fr_320"></span>[1](#fn_319). Now, after having paid
reverence to Brahman, to the Brahma*ri*shi, to (those who descend from)
Brahman's womb, to Indra, Pra*g*âpati, Vasish*th*a, Vâmadeva, Kahola
Kaushîtaki, Mahâkaushîtaki, Suya*gñ*a *S*âṅkhâyana, Â*s*valâyana,
Aitareya, Mahaitareya, Kâtyâyana, *S*â*t*yâyana, *S*âkalya, Babhru,
Bâbhravya, Ma*nd*u, Mâ*nd*avya, and to all the teachers of the past, we
will henceforth explain the rules for the Âra*n*yaka as forming the
subject of Svâdhyâya (private recitation of a text).

2 <span id="fr_321"></span>[2](#fn_320). The teacher abstains through
one day and one night from sexual intercourse and from eating flesh.

3 <span id="fr_322"></span>[3-5](#fn_321). Raw flesh, a Ka*nd*âla, a
woman that has lately been confined, or that has her courses, seeing
blood or persons whose hands have been cut off: (these persons and
things he shall know form) impediments for the study.

4\. And of the corpse-like (animals?).

5\. Those which enter (their dens?) with the mouth first (?).

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

6 <span id="fr_323"></span>[6](sbe29094.htm#fn_323). When he has
vomited, or when his beard has been shaved,

7 <span id="fr_324"></span>[7](sbe29094.htm#fn_324). When he has eaten
flesh or partaken of a *S*râddha or birth dinner,

8\. During the days that immediately follow on (days of) study in the
village,

9\. Three nights (and days), if (he has been) put out of order,

10\. (Or has been violently) seized by others,

11\. And during the second half of the days that precede (?) the Parvan
days,

12\. And if fire-flames, lightning, thunder, (heavy) rains, and great
clouds appear,

13\. And if a storm (blows) that carries away pebbles, as long as that
lasts.

2, 1. During four months after the full moon of Âshâ*dh*a let him not
study.

2 <span id="fr_325"></span>[2](#fn_322). Especially the *S*akvarî verses
(are concerned by what has been declared). Such are the rules.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_319"></span>[141:1](sbe29093.htm#fr_320) 1, 1 seqq. Comp.
the general remarks on this sixth book in the Introduction, [p.
11](sbe29002.htm#page_11).

For the names in the opening invocation, comp. above, 1V, 10; on the
Vratas and the study of the different Âra*n*yaka sections chiefly
treated of in this book, see above, II, 11. 12, and the Introduction,
[p. 8](sbe29002.htm#page_8).

<span id="fn_320"></span>[141:2](sbe29093.htm#fr_321) Comp. II, 11, 6.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[141:3-5](sbe29093.htm#fr_322) Comp. II, 12,
10, and the note of Nârâya*n*a, p. 160 of the German edition.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[142:2](sbe29093.htm#fr_325) 2, 2. It seems to
me that this Sûtra should be divided into two (after *s*akvarya*h*), so
that the words iti niyamâ*h* would correspond to iti bhâshikam, chap. 2,
13.
