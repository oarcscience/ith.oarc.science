### KA*ND*IKÂ 14.

1\. In the fourth month of pregnancy the Sîmantonnayana (or parting of
the hair, is performed).

2\. In the fortnight of the increasing moon, when the moon stands in
conjunction with a Nakshatra (that has a name) of masculine gender—

3 <span id="fr_440"></span>[3](#fn_439.md). Then he gives its place to the
fire, and having spread to the west of it a bull's hide with the neck to
the east, with the hair outside, (he makes oblations,) while (his wife)
is sitting on that (hide) and takes hold of him, with the two (verses),
'May Dhât*ri* give to his worshipper,' with the two verses, 'I invoke
Râkâ' (Rig-veda II, 32, 4 seq.), and with (the texts), 'Ne*g*amesha,'
and, 'Pra*g*âpati, no other one than thou' (Rig-Veda X, 121, 10).

4\. He then three times parts her hair upwards (i.e. beginning from the
front) with a bunch containing an even number of unripe fruits, and with
a porcupine's quill that has three white spots, and with three bunches
of Ku*s*a grass, with (the words), 'Bhûr bhuva*h*, svar, om!'

5\. Or four times.

6\. He gives orders to two lute-players, 'Sing king Soma.'

7 <span id="fr_441"></span>[7](#fn_440). (They sing.md) 'May Soma our king
bless the human race. Settled is the wheel of N.N.'—(here they name) the

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_439"></span>[181:3](sbe29113.htm#fr_440.md) 14, 3. Comp.
above, chap. 8, 9. Regarding the two verses Dhâtâ dadâtu dâ*s*ushe, see
*S*âṅkh.-G*ri*hya I, 22, 7. The Ne*g*amesha hymn is Rig-veda Khailika
sûkta, vol. vi, p. 31, ed. Max Muller.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[181:7](sbe29113.htm#fr_441.md) Comp. Pâraskara I,
15, 8. The Gâthâ there is somewhat different. I cannot see why in the
Â*s*valâyana redaction of it nivish*t*a*k*akrâsau should not be
explained, conformably to the <span id="page_182">p. 182</span> regular
Sandhi laws, as nivish*t*a*k*akrâ asau. The wheel of course means the
dominion.
