------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 11.

1\. Now (follows) the ritual of the animal sacrifice.

2 <span id="fr_422"></span>[2](#fn_421). Having prepared to the north of
the fire the place for the *S*âmitra fire, having given drink (to the
animal which he is going to sacrifice), having washed the animal, having
placed it to the east (of the fire) with its face to the west, having
made oblations with the two *Rik*as, 'Agni as our messenger' (Rig-veda
I, 12, 1 seq.), let him touch (the animal) from behind with a fresh
branch on which there are leaves, with (the formula), 'Agreeable to such
and such (a deity) I touch thee.'

3\. He sprinkles it from before with water in which rice and barley are,
with (the formula), 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I sprinkle
thee.'

4\. Having given (to the animal) to drink of that (water), he should
pour out the rest (of it) along its right fore-foot.

5\. Having carried fire round (it), performing that act only (without
repeating a corresponding Mantra), they lead it to the north.

6 <span id="fr_423"></span>[6](#fn_422). In front of it they carry a
fire-brand.

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

7 <span id="fr_424"></span>[7](#fn_423) This is the *S*âmitra (fire).

8 <span id="fr_425"></span>[8](#fn_424). With the two Vapâ*s*rapa*n*î
ladles the 'performer' touches the animal.

9\. The sacrificer (touches) the performer.

10 <span id="fr_426"></span>[10](#fn_425). To the west of the *S*âmitra
(fire) he (the *S*amit*ri*) kills (the animal), the head of which is
turned to the east or to the west, the feet to the north; and having
placed a grass-blade on his side of the (animal's) navel, (the
'performer') draws out the omentum, cuts off the omentum, seizes it with
the two Agni*s*rapa*n*îs, sprinkles it with water, warms it at the
*S*âmitra (fire), takes it before that fire, roasts it, being seated to
the south, goes round (the two fires), and sacrifices it.

11 <span id="fr_427"></span>[11](#fn_426). At the same fire they cook a
mess of food.

12 <span id="fr_428"></span>[12](#fn_427). Having cut off the eleven
Avadânas (or portions which have to be cut off) from the animal, from
all its limbs, having boiled them at the *S*âmitra (fire),

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

and having warmed the heart on a spit, let him sacrifice first from the
mess of cooked food (mentioned in Sûtra 11);

13\. Or together with the Avadâna portions.

14 <span id="fr_429"></span>[14](#fn_428). From each of the (eleven)
Avadânas he cuts off two portions.

15 <span id="fr_430"></span>[15](#fn_429). They perform the rites only
(without corresponding Mantras) with the heart's spit (i.e. the spit on
which the heart had been; see Sûtra 12).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_421"></span>[176:2](sbe29110.htm#fr_422) 11, 2. The Sâmitra
fire (literally, the fire of the Samit*ri*, who prepares the flesh of
the immolated animal) is the one mentioned below in Sûtras 7 and 10.
Comp. Indische Studien, X, 345. 'I touch thee' is upâkaromi; comp.
Kâtyâyana-*S*rauta-sûtra VI, 3, 19. 26.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[176:6](sbe29110.htm#fr_423) It seems that this
fire-brand is the same which had been carried round the animal,
according to Sûtra 5. Comp. Kâtyâyana-*S*rauta-sûtra VI, 5, 2-5.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[177:7](sbe29110.htm#fr_424) Comp. Sûtra 2.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[177:8](sbe29110.htm#fr_425) On the two
Vapâ*s*rapa*n*îs, comp. Kâtyâyana-*S*rauta-sûtra VI, 5, 7; Indische
Studien, X, 345. The act which is here attributed to the kart*ri*
('performer'), belongs in the *S*rauta ritual to the incumbencies of the
Pratiprasthât*ri*.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[177:10](sbe29110.htm#fr_426) On the way in
which animals had to b. killed at sacrifices, see Weber's Indische
Studien, IX, 222 seq.

On the position of the head and the feet of the victim, comp.
Kâtyâyana-*S*rauta-sûtra VI, 5, 16. 17.

According to Kâtyâyana VI, 6, 8 seq. a grass-blade is placed on the dead
animal's body before the navel (agre*n*a nâbhim); through that
grass-blade he cuts into the body and draws out the omentum.

'That fire' is, according to Nârâya*n*a, not the Sâmitra but the
Aupâsana fire. In the same way in the *S*rauta ritual the warming of the
omentum is performed at the Sâmitra, the boiling at the Âhavanîya fire.
Kâtyâyana VI, 6, 13. 16.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[177:11](sbe29110.htm#fr_427) The Aupâsana fire
is referred to.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[177:12](sbe29110.htm#fr_428) The eleven
portions are indicated by Kâtyâyana, *S*rauta-sûtra VI, 7, 6.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[178:14](sbe29110.htm#fr_429) 'A Pa*ñk*âvattin
cuts off three portions. Having performed the Upastara*n*a and the
Pratyabhighâra*n*a (the first and second pouring out of Â*g*ya) he
sacrifices (the cut-off portions).' Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[178:15](sbe29110.htm#fr_430) On the rites
regarding the spit, see Kâtyâyana VI, 10, 1 seq.; Indische Studien, X,
346.
