8 <span id="fr_590"></span>[8](#fn_589.md). On his two ears the two
Prâ*s*itrahara*n*as (i.e. the vessels into which the portion of the
sacrificial food belonging to the Brahman is put).

9\. Or, if there is only one (Prâ*s*itrahara*n*a), breaking it (in two
pieces).

10\. On his belly the (vessel called) Pâtrî,

11\. And the cup into which the cut-off portions (of the sacrificial
food) are put.

12\. On his secret parts the (staff called) *S*amyâ.

19 <span id="fr_592"></span>[19](#fn_591.md). And the implements made of
copper, iron, and earthenware.

20 <span id="fr_593"></span>[20](#fn_592.md). Taking out the omentum of the
she-animal he should cover therewith the head and the mouth (of the dead
person) with the verse, 'Put on the armour (which will protect thee)
against Agni, by (that which comes from) the cows' (Rig-veda X, 16, 7).

21\. Taking out the kidneys (of the animal) he should lay them into the
hands (of the dead body) with the verse, 'Escape the two hounds, the
sons of Saramâ' (Rig-veda X, 14, 10), the right (kidney) into the right
(hand), the left into the left.

22\. The heart (of the animal he puts) on the heart (of the deceased).

23 <span id="fr_594"></span>[23](#fn_593.md). And two lumps (of flour or
rice), according to some (teachers).

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

24 <span id="fr_595"></span>[24](#fn_594). (Only.md) if there are no
kidneys, according to some (teachers).

25 <span id="fr_596"></span>[25](#fn_595.md). Having distributed the whole
(animal), limb by limb (placing its different limbs on the corresponding
limbs of the deceased), and having covered it with its hide, he recites,
when the Pra*n*îta water is carried forward, (the verse), 'Agni, do not
overturn this cup' (Rig-veda X, 16, 8).

26\. Bending his left knee he should sacrifice Â*g*ya oblations into the
Dakshi*n*a fire with (the formulas), 'To Agni svâhâ! To Kâma svâhâ! To
the world svâhâ! To Anumati svâhâ!'

27 <span id="fr_597"></span>[27](#fn_596). A fifth (oblation.md) on the
chest of the deceased with (the formula), 'From this one verily thou
hast been born. May he now be born out of thee, N.N.! To the
heaven-world svâhâ!'

<span id="fn_588"></span>[240:1](sbe29148.htm#fr_589.md) 3, 1. On the
different implements mentioned in the following Sûtras, comp. Prof. Max
Müller's paper in the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen
Gesellschaft, vol. ix, pp. vii seqq.; lxxviii seqq.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[240:8](sbe29148.htm#fr_590.md) On the Prâ*s*itra
and the Prâ*s*itrahara*n*as, comp. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer,
pp. 119 (with note 6), 120, 131.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[241:17](sbe29148.htm#fr_591.md) Nârâya*n*a
explains âse*k*anavanti by bilavanti. On p*ri*shadâ*g*ya ('sprinkled
butter') comp. the two last Sûtras of the first chapter.

<span id="fn_591"></span>[241:19](sbe29148.htm#fr_592.md) The statement in
*S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a XII, 5, 2, 14 is somewhat different.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[241:20](sbe29148.htm#fr_593.md) Anustara*n*yâ
vapâm. See chap. 2, 4.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[241:23](sbe29148.htm#fr_594.md) Nârâya*n*a states
that these lumps are not put, as one would be inclined to believe, on
the heart, but into the hands of the deceased. Sûtra 24 shows that this
interpretation is correct.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[242:24](sbe29148.htm#fr_595.md) I.e. if there is
no Anustara*n*î animal, which is considered as optional (see chap. 2,
4).

<span id="fn_595"></span>[242:25](sbe29148.htm#fr_596.md) Comp. Kâtyâyana
XXV, 7, 35.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[242:27](sbe29148.htm#fr_597.md) He who is born
out of the deceased, is Agni. See *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a II, 3, 3, 5;
and also XII, 5, 2, 15.
