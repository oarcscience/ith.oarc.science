<p>1. 'Be queen with thy father-in-law,' with this verse (Rig-veda X, 85, 46) her father or brother sacrifices with a sword's point on her head, or with the Sruva, standing while she is sitting, with his face turned to the west, while her face is turned to the east.</p>  
<p>2. 'I seize thy hand for the sake of happiness' (Rig-veda X, 85, 36), with these words (the bridegroom) seizes with his right hand her right hand with the thumb, both hands being turned with the palms upwards, he standing while she is sitting, with his face turned to the west, while her face is turned to the east.</p>  
<p>3. And when he has murmured the following five verses,</p>  
<p>4&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. (He continues thus,) 'This am I, that art thou;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that art thou, this am I; the heaven I, the earth thou; the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> art thou, the S&acirc;man I. So be thou devoted to me.</p>  
<p>'Well! Let us here marry. Let us beget offspring. Let us acquire many sons who may reach old age.'</p>  
<p>5. (The &Acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya) fills, with the words bh&ucirc;r bhuva<I>h</I> sva<I>h</I>, a new water-pot,</p>  
<p>6&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. Throws into it (branches) with milky sap and leaves, of a tree the name of which is masculine, together with Ku<I>s</I>a grass,</p>  
<p>7. And gold, according to some (teachers),</p>  
<p>8. And hands it over to a student who observes silence.</p>  
<p>9&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>. They should walk round this Sthey&acirc; water, (placed) to the north-east, so that they turn their right sides . towards it.</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A></p>  
<p>10. And after (the &Acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya) has placed a stone towards the northern direction,</p>  
<p>11. (The bridegroom) makes her rise with the words, 'Come, thou joyful one,'</p>  
<p>12. And makes her tread with the tip of her right foot on the stone, with the words, 'Come, tread on the stone; like a stone be firm. Tread the foes down; overcome the enemies.'</p>  
<p>13. He then leads her round the fire so that their right sides are turned to it,</p>  
<p>14. And gives her a second garment with the same text (chap. 12, &sect; 3).</p>  
<p>15. Her father or brother pours out of a basket fried grain mixed with <I>S</I>am&icirc; leaves into her joined hands.</p>  
<p>16. The spreading under, the sprinkling over, and the second sprinkling over (are done) with &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya.</p>  
<p>17&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A>. She sacrifices those (fried grains).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_77"></A><A HREF="sbe29015.htm#fr_78">35:4</A> 13, 4. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a states that here four Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as should repeat <A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A> the S&ucirc;ry&acirc; hymn (Rig-veda X, 85) to the bride. That, according to <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana, that hymn is recited at the wedding, is clear from chap. 14, 12.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_78"></A><A HREF="sbe29015.htm#fr_79">36:6</A> Saksh&icirc;r&acirc;nt sapal&acirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;nt saku<I>s</I>&acirc;n. N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's commentary divides sa ku<I>s</I>&acirc;n, and refers sa to the &acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya. But this sa would be superfluous, and the substantive to which saksh&icirc;r&acirc;n and sapal&acirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;n are to be referred, is, as both the nature of the case and the corresponding passages show, <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;n and not ku<I>s</I>&acirc;n. Comp. the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra IV, 17, 5: pal&acirc;sa<I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;<I>m</I> sapal&acirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;<I>m</I> nikh&acirc;ya, and a passage concerning the very rite here described, &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana-pari<I>s</I>ish<I>t</I>a I, 24: audumbary&acirc;rddhay&acirc;. (read, &acirc;rdray&acirc;?) <I>s</I>&acirc;khay&acirc; sapal&acirc;<I>s</I>ay&acirc; sahira<I>n</I>yapavitray&acirc; sad&ucirc;rv&acirc;pavitray&acirc;. The MS. of the <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya-s&ucirc;tra has saksh&icirc;r&acirc;n pal&acirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;n saku<I>s</I>&acirc;n.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_79"></A><A HREF="sbe29015.htm#fr_80">36:9</A> 'The Sthey&acirc; water has to be so placed that when the bride and the bridegroom walk (their seven steps, see chap. 14, 5 seq.), their right sides are turned towards it.' N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a. Comp., regarding the Sthey&acirc; water and its bearer, the G<I>ri</I>hya-sa<I>m</I>graha-pari<I>s</I>ish<I>t</I>a II, 26. 30. 35.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_80"></A><A HREF="sbe29015.htm#fr_81">37:17</A> I believe that the words forming this S&ucirc;tra, t&acirc;<I>&ntilde;</I> <I>g</I>uhoti, are taken from the same lost old G<I>ri</I>hya text which <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana has followed word for word also in I, 5, 1-5 and elsewhere. This is made probable by the comparison of P&acirc;raskara I, 6, 2. The author of our text, while literally adopting the words of his original, has not quite succeeded in welding them together with his own statements; thus the sacrifice of grains is treated of in this S&ucirc;tra and in the first S&ucirc;tra of the next chapter, as if there were two different acts, while indeed it is one and the same.</P>
