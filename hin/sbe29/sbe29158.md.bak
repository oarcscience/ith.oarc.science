Intangible Textual Heritage

### KA*ND*IKÂ 4.

1 <span id="fr_693"></span>[1-5](#fn_692.md). There are four kinds of
Pâkaya*gñ*as, viz. the huta, the ahuta, the prahuta, and the prâ*s*ita.

2\. On the following five occasions, viz. the wedding, the tonsure (of
the child's head), the initiation (of the Brahma*k*ârin), the cutting of
the beard, and the parting of the hair, (on these occasions) in the
outer hall,

3\. On a place that has been smeared (with cow-dung), which is elevated,
and which has been sprinkled (with water), he establishes the fire,

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

4\. Having kindled it by attrition, according to some teachers, at his
marriage.

5\. During the northern course of the sun, in the time of the increasing
moon, on an auspicious day he shall seize the hand of a girl,

6 <span id="fr_694"></span>[6](#fn_693). Under one of the (three times.md)
three Nakshatras of which a constellation designated as Uttara is first,

7\. Or under (the Nakshatras) Svâti, M*ri*ga*s*iras, or Rohi*n*î.

8\. Three (wives are allowed) to a Brâhma*n*a, in accordance with the
order of the castes,

9\. Two to a Râ*g*anya,

10\. One to a Vai*s*ya,

11\. One *S*ûdra wife besides to all, according to some (teachers),
without using Mantras (at the ceremonies of wedding, &c.).

12 <span id="fr_695"></span>[12](#fn_694.md). He then makes her put on the
(under) garment with (the verse), 'Live to old age; put on the garment!
Be a protectress of the human tribes against imprecation. Live a hundred
years full of vigour; clothe thyself in wealth and children. Blessed
with life put on this garment!'

13 <span id="fr_696"></span>[13](#fn_695.md). Then the upper garment with
(the verse), 'The goddesses who spun, who wove, who spread

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

out, and who drew out the threads on both sides, may those goddesses
clothe thee for the sake of long life. Blessed with life put on this
garment!'

14 <span id="fr_697"></span>[14](#fn_696). (The bride's father?.md) anoints
the two, (while the bridegroom recites the verse,) 'May the Vi*s*ve
devâs, may the waters unite our hearts. May Mâtari*s*van, may Dhât*ri*,
may Desh*t*rî (the 'showing' goddess) join us.'

15\. (The bridegroom), having accepted her who is given away by her
father, takes her and goes away (from that place) with (the verse),
'When thou wanderest far away with thy heart to the regions of the world
like the wind, may the gold-winged Vaikar*n*a (i.e. the wind?) grant
that thy heart may dwell with me! N.N.!'

16 <span id="fr_698"></span>[16](#fn_697.md). He then makes them look at
each other (while the bridegroom repeats the verses), 'With no evil eye,
not bringing death to thy husband, bring luck to the cattle, be full of
joy and vigour. Give birth to heroes; be godly and friendly. Bring us
luck, to men and animals.

'Soma has acquired (thee) first (as his wife); after him the Gandharva
has acquired (thee). Thy third husband is Agni; the fourth is thy human
husband.

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

'Soma has given thee to the Gandharva; the Gandharva has given thee to
Agni. Wealth and children Agni has given to me, and besides this wife.

'Pûshan! Lead her to us, the highly blessed one. Sâ na ûrû u*s*atî
vihara, yasyâm u*s*anta*h* praharâma *s*epa*m* yasyâm u kâmâ bahavo
nivish*t*yâ (nivish*t*â?) iti.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_692"></span>[276:1-5](sbe29158.htm#fr_693.md) 4, 1-5. See
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 5, 1-5 and the notes.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[277:6](sbe29158.htm#fr_694.md) I.e. under the
constellations Uttaraphalgunî or the two constellations following it,
Uttarâshâ*dh*â or the two constellations following it, Uttarabhâdrapadâ
or the two constellations following it.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[277:12](sbe29158.htm#fr_695.md) The words of the
Mantra bhavâ k*ri*sh*t*înâm abhi*s*astipâvâ no doubt are an imitation of
Rig-veda I, 76, 3, bhavâ ya*gñ*â*n*âm abhi*s*astipâvâ (where the words
are applied to Agni). Thus the use of the masculine abhi*s*astipâvâ with
reference to the bride may be accounted for.

<span id="fn_695"></span>[277:13](sbe29158.htm#fr_696.md) Comp.
Atharva-veda XIV, 1, 45. This parallel passage shows us the way to
correct the text of this very much corrupted Mantra.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[278:14](sbe29158.htm#fr_697.md) The literal
translation would be: 'He salves together (sama*ñg*ayati) the two . . .
May the waters salve together (sama*ñg*antu) our hearts.' It was a real
anointing of the bridegroom and of the bride, that took place, and we
cannot accept Professor Stenzler's translation (based on *G*ayarâma's
note: sama*ñg*ayati paraspara*m* sammukhîkaroti), by which the proper
signification of sama*ñg*ayati is effaced: Dann heisst (der Vater der
Braut) sie beide zusammentreten. See the note on *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya
I, 12, 5. The parallel passage of the Khâdira-G*ri*hya runs thus:
apare*n*âgnim auduko gatvâ pâ*n*igrâha*m* mûrdhany avasi*ñk*ed, vadhû*m*
*k*a, sama*ñg*antv ity avasikta*h*.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[278:16](sbe29158.htm#fr_698.md) Comp. Rig-veda X,
85, 44. 40. 41. 37.
