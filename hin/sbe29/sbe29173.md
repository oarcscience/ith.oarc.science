food).

2 <span id="fr_755"></span>[2](#fn_754.md). Having cooked a mess of
sacrificial food, and sacrificed the two Â*g*yabhâgas, he offers two
Â*g*ya oblations, (the first with the verse,) 'The gods have generated
the goddess Speech; manifold animals speak her forth. May she, the
sweet-sounding, the cow that (for milk) gives sap and juice to us,
Speech, the highly-praised one, come to us. Svâhâ!'

3\. And the second (oblation) with (the verse), 'May vigour us to-day'
(Vâ*g*. Sa*m*hitâ XVIII, 33).

4\. He then sacrifices (four oblations) of cooked food with (the
formulas),

'Through up-breathing may I enjoy food. Svâhâ!

'Through down-breathing may I enjoy smells. Svâhâ!

'Through my eye may I enjoy visible things. Svâhâ!

'Through my ear may I enjoy renown. Svâhâ!'

5\. After he has eaten (himself), he should set apart food of all kinds,
and of all different sorts of flavour, and should give it to him (i.e.
to his son) to eat,

6 <span id="fr_756"></span>[6](#fn_755). Silently or with (the word.md),
'Hanta' (i.e. Well!). For it is said in the *S*ruti, 'Men (live on) the
word hanta.'

7\. (He feeds the child) with flesh of (the bird called) Bhâradvâ*g*î,
if he wishes (to the child) fluency of speech,

8\. With flesh of partridge, if abundance of nourishment,

9\. With fish, if swiftness,

10\. (With flesh) of (the bird) K*ri*kashâ, if long life,

11\. (With flesh) of (the bird) Â*t*i, if desirous of holy lustre,

12\. With all, if desirous of all.

13\. Or each (sort of) food one by one. Then (follows) feeding of the
Brâhma*n*as, or each (sort of) food one by one. Then feeding of the
Brâhma*n*as.
