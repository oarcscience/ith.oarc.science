### KA*ND*IKÂ 3.

1 <span id="fr_773"></span>[1](#fn_772.md). Having walked round the fire
with his right side turned towards it, he sits down.

2\. Taking hold (of the student), he sacrifices the Â*g*ya oblations,
and after having partaken (of the remains of the sacrificial food) he
instructs him, 'A student art thou. Take water. Do the service. Do not
sleep in the day-time. Keep silence. Put fuel on (the fire). Take
water.'

3\. He then recites the Sâvitrî to him, who is seated to the north of
the fire, with his face to the west, sitting near the teacher, and looks
(at the teacher), while (the teacher) looks at him;

4 <span id="fr_774"></span>[4](#fn_773). Some say, to (the student.md) who
is standing or seated to the south (of the fire);

5\. Pâda by Pâda, (then) hemistich by hemistich, and the third time the
whole (verse), reciting it together (with the student);

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

6\. After one year, or after six months, or after twenty-four days, or
after twelve days, or after six days, or after three days.

7 <span id="fr_775"></span>[7](#fn_774.md). To a Brâhma*n*a, however, he
should recite a (Sâvitrî) verse in the Gâyatrî metre immediately. For it
is said in the *S*ruti, 'To Agni indeed belongs the Brâhma*n*a.'

8\. A Trish*t*ubh verse to a Râ*g*anya,

9\. A *G*agatî to a Vai*s*ya,

10\. Or a Gâyatrî to (persons of) all (castes).
