### KHA*ND*A 3.

1 <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_20). Now (follow.md) the ceremonies of
the days of the new and full moon.

He fasts.

2 <span id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_21.md). In the morning, when the sun
shines on the

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

top of the great trees, that is the most auspicious time for all kinds
of sacrifices, unless there be a special rule.

3 <span id="fr_23"></span>[3](#fn_22.md). With a genial mind, clean, on a
pure, protected spot, having cooked a full, thin mess of rice, he offers
that cooked oblation to the deities of the festivals of the new and full
moon, distributing it in the due way.

4 <span id="fr_24"></span>[4](#fn_23.md). In the oblations of cooked food
the acts of taking (the intended oblation), of putting it down (near the
fire), and of sprinkling it (with water) are performed with regard to
the deities of the (respective) Mantras.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

5 <span id="fr_25"></span>[5](#fn_24.md). And the rules about the portions
to be cut off (from the sacrificial food, are valid).

6 <span id="fr_26"></span>[6](#fn_25.md). But before the sacrifices of the
new and full moon one should make offerings to the deities of the
Anvârambha*n*îya ceremony.

7 <span id="fr_27"></span>[7](#fn_26.md). The time for the new moon
sacrifice is not elapsed until the full moon, nor that for the full moon
sacrifice until the new moon.

8 <span id="fr_28"></span>[8](#fn_27.md). And some say that the morning
oblation may be made at the time of the evening oblation, in the case of
danger.

9\. But the time is fixed, as at the Agnihotra an expiation has been
prescribed for him who has neglected the time.

10\. At the two daily oblations one should use as sacrificial food
either rice or barley or grains.

11\. In case these are not at hand, other (sorts of sacrificial food
are) not prohibited.

12\. Some say that if he uses grains, he should wash them.

13\. With the other (kinds of food) no such preparation takes place.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

14 <span id="fr_29"></span>[14-15](#fn_28.md). In the evening (he makes the
oblation) to Agni, in the morning to Sûrya,

15\. And after both silently to Pra*g*âpati.

16\. Some (say that) before the first oblation a piece of wood (is to be
put on the fire).

17 <span id="fr_30"></span>[17](#fn_29.md). The sprinkling with water as
indicated (in the *S*rauta-sûtra).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_20"></span>[16:1](sbe29005.htm#fr_21.md) 3, 1. Most probably
this rule should be divided into two Sûtras, so that atha
darsapûr*n*amâsau would stand as the heading of the chapter; comp.
below, chap. 18, 1, atha *k*aturthîkarma; chap. 24, 1, atha *g*âtakarma,
&c.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[16:2](sbe29005.htm#fr_22.md) 'If this is expressly
stated, the oblation is to be made in night-time; for instance, at the
Vâstoshpatîya ceremony it is stated, "The tenth oblation of the
Sthâlîpâka, to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t at night" (see below, III, 4, 8).'
Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[17:3](sbe29005.htm#fr_23.md) On vighana, which I
have translated thin, see the note in the German edition, pp. 119 seq.

The deities of the festivals of the new and full moon (i.e. of the rites
which in the *S*rauta ritual correspond to that taught here) are, at the
full moon, Agni and Agnîshomau, at the new moon, Agni, Vish*n*u, and
Indrâgnî, who are preceded in both cases by Agni and Soma as the deities
of the two â*g*yabhâgas (see below, ch. 9, 7), and followed by Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t. For more detailed statements see Hillebrandt, Das
altindische Neu- und Vollmondsopfer (Jena, 1879), pp. 102 seq.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[17:4](sbe29005.htm#fr_24.md) For instance, the
taking of the portion of food destined to Agni should be performed with
the Mantra: Agnaye tvâ *g*ushta*m* g*ri*h*n*âmi, &c. A number of
ceremonies common to the Sthâlîpâka ritual and to the ordinary ritual of
Â*g*ya oblations, such as the strewing of Ku*s*a grass round the fire,
the ceremonies regarding the Pavitras (strainers), &c., have to be
supplied here from the Â*g*ya ritual given below (ch. 7 seq.); this may
be looked upon as an argument in favour of our conjecture which will be
stated in the preface (vol. ii of the G*ri*hya-sûtras), that our text,
as probably is the case also with the Pâraskara-sûtra, is based on an
original, the opening sentences of which are preserved to us in *S*âṅkh.
I, 5, 1-5 = Pâraskara I, 4, 1-5, so that the first chapters of
*S*âṅkhâyana, and among them the exposition of the festivals of the full
and new moon, would have been prefixed to the original commencement of
the text.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[18:5](sbe29005.htm#fr_25.md) On the avadânadharmâs
comp. Weber, Indische Studien, X, 95; Hillebrandt, Neu- und
Vollmondsopfer, pp. 122 seqq.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[18:6](sbe29005.htm#fr_26.md) The
Anvârambha*n*îyâ-ish*t*i is the sacrifice taught in the *S*rauta texts
which is to be performed before the sacrificer for the first time offers
the Dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa sacrifice. See Weber, Indische Studien, X, 330;
Hillebrandt, loc. cit., p. 185. The deities of this ceremony are
Agnîvish*n*û, Sarasvatî, and Sarasvat.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[18:7](sbe29005.htm#fr_27.md) Comp. the expiatory
sacrifice prescribed in the Pari*s*ish*t*a book, V, 4.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[18:8](sbe29005.htm#fr_28.md) The text here passes
over from the two monthly sacrifices to the two daily ones, which
correspond to the Agnihotra of the *S*rauta ritual.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[19:14-15](sbe29005.htm#fr_29.md) 14, 15. These are
the same deities who are worshipped also at the Agnihotra.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[19:17](sbe29005.htm#fr_30.md) *S*rauta-sûtra II,
6, 9-11. Comp. p. 120 of the German edition.
