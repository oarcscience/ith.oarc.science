When a son has been born, (the father) should, before other people touch him, give him to eat from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon) butter and honey with which he has ground gold(-dust), with (the verse), 'I administer to thee the wisdom ('veda') of honey, of ghee, raised by Savit<I>ri</I> the bountiful. Long-living, protected by the gods, live a hundred autumns in this world!'</p>  
<p>2. Approaching (his mouth) to (the child's) two ears he murmurs the 'production of intelligence:' 'Intelligence may give to thee god Savit<I>ri</I>, intelligence may goddess Sarasvat&icirc;, intelligence may give to thee the two divine A<I>s</I>vins, wreathed with lotus.'</p>

<p>6. Of two syllables, if he is desirous of firm position; of four syllables, if he is desirous of holy lustre;</p>  
<p>7. But in every case with an even number (of syllables) for men, an uneven for women.</p>  
<p>8. And let him also find out (for the child) a name to be used at respectful salutations (such as that due to the &Acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya at the ceremony of the initiation); that his mother and his father (alone) should know till his initiation.</p>  
<p>9. When he returns from a journey, he embraces his son's head and murmurs, 'From limb by limb thou art produced; out of the heart thou art born. Thou indeed art the self called son; so live a hundred autumns!'&#151;(thus) he kisses him three times on his head.</p>
