### KHA*ND*A 12.

1\. The bridegroom, who has bathed and for whom auspicious ceremonies
have been performed, is escorted by happy young women, who are not
widows, to the girl's house.

2\. To these he shall not behave unobsequiously, except where forbidden
food or a transgression is concerned.

3\. Having obtained their permission, he then gives her the garment with
(the verse), 'The Raibhî was' (Rig-veda X, 85, 6).

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

4\. With (the verse), 'Mind was the cushion' (ibid. 7) he takes up the
salve-box.

5 <span id="fr_74"></span>[5](#fn_73.md). The verse for the Anointing is,
'May the Vi*s*ve devâs anoint (or, unite),' (ibid. 47.)

6 <span id="fr_75"></span>[6](#fn_74). 'As this (has protected.md) *S*a*k*î
the beloved one, and Aditi the mother of noble sons, and Apâlâ who was
free from widowhood, nay it thus here protect thee, N.N.!'—with these
words (the. bridegroom) gives her into her right hand the quill of a
porcupine (and) a string of three twisted threads,

7\. With the verse, 'Shape by shape' (Rig-veda VI, 47, 18) a mirror into
the left.

8\. Her relations tie (to her body) a red and black, woollen or linen
cord with three (amulet) gems, with the verse, 'Dark-blue and red' (Rig.
veda X, 85, 28).

9\. With the verse, 'Full of honey the herbs' (Rig-veda IV, 57, 3), (the
bridegroom) ties (to her body) Madhûka flowers.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

10 <span id="fr_76"></span>[10](#fn_75.md). At the wedding one cow, when
the Argha ceremony has been performed; in the house one cow: these are
the two Madhuparka cows.

11 <span id="fr_77"></span>[11](#fn_76). (The bridegroom.md) makes the girl
sit down behind the fire, and while she takes hold of him he makes three
oblations with the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

12\. A fourth (oblation) with (the three Mahâvyâh*ri*tis) together is to
be understood from this rule.

13\. In this way, where no express rule is stated, in all sacrifices
that procure happiness, one is to sacrifice before and afterwards with
these same (Mahâvyâh*ri*tis).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_73"></span>[33:5](sbe29014.htm#fr_74.md) 12, 5. On the
ceremony of 'salving together' (sama*ñg*ana), comp. Pâraskara I, 4, 14;
Gobhila II, 2, &c. Professor Stenzler is certainly wrong in translating
Pâraskara's sama*ñg*ayati by 'heisst sie beide zusammentreten'
(according to *G*ayarâma's explication, sammukhîkaroti). It is clear
from *S*âṅkhâyana, that a real anointing of bridegroom and bride took
place. This was performed, according to Gobhila, by the 'audaka' (this
seems to be the same person that is mentioned in Pâraskara I, 8, 3), of
whom it is said, pâ*n*igrâha*m* (i.e. the bridegroom) mûrdhade*s*e
’vasi*ñk*ati, tathetarâm. Nârâya*n*a, on the contrary, in his note on
our passage, says that it is the bridegroom who anoints the eyes of the
girl with the verse quoted. But the word sam-a*ñg*ana, and the obvious
meaning of the whole rite, make it rather probable that both were
anointed, and that this was done by a third person.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[33:6](sbe29014.htm#fr_75.md) Comp. below, chap.
22, 8, where the use of a porcupine's quill is prescribed at the
sîmantonnayana ceremony; and see chap. 22, 10.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[34:10](sbe29014.htm#fr_76.md) As to the meaning of
arhayitvâ I differ from the opinion of Nârâya*n*a (see his note on p.
127 of the German edition), who takes gâm as the object of this verb
(gâm arhayitvâ pû*g*ayitvâ mâtâ rudrâ*n*âm ity *rik*a*m* *g*apitvâ
\[comp. Pâraskara I, 3, 27\]). The real meaning of arhayati is, to
perform the Argha ceremony for a guest. Evidently in this Sûtra two
different occasions are stated on which the Argha reception, eventually
with the killing of a cow, should be performed; firstly, the bridegroom
should be so received in the house of the bride's father; secondly, when
the newly-married people have arrived at their own house, an Argha
reception should there be offered to them, perhaps, as the commentaries
state, by the Â*k*ârya.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[34:11](sbe29014.htm#fr_77.md) According to
Nârâya*n*a it is the Â*k*ârya who performs the rite prescribed in this
Sûtra; Râma*k*andra, on the contrary, refers it to the bridegroom, which
seems to me right. Comp. Gobhila II, 1.

In *S*âṅkhâyana's description of the wedding ceremonies the point at
which the bride passes over from the paternal power into that of her new
husband is not expressly indicated. Pâraskara (I, 4, 15) clearly
indicates it (pitrâ prattâm âdâya), and in the Pari*s*ish*t*a of the
Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya this act of handing over the girl is treated of in
detail (I, 22). On this depends the description in the Prayogaratna,
fol. 69; comp. also Colebrooke's Miscell. Essays, I, 210. The Paddhati
of Râma*k*andra does not fail to mention the kanyâpradâna, but I do not
think that the succession of the different rites is stated there
correctly. According to the Paddhati the bridegroom goes to the house of
the girl's father, and there, after the madhuparka has been offered, the
bride is given over to him; he then (labdhavadhûka*h*) goes (chap. 12,
1), accompanied by young women, to the kautukâgâra, where the ceremonies
described in chap. 12, 3 seq. take place. Pâraskara, on the contrary,
describes the handing over of the garments, the anointing, &c., as
preceding the giving over of the girl, and indeed it is scarcely
possible to see in the acts of dressing, adorning the girl, &c., in
which both the bridegroom and her relations <span id="page_35">p.
35</span> take part, anything but preparatory performances that precede
the decisive moment. The sacrifice, on the contrary, which the
bridegroom performs, according to chap. 12, 11, in common with his
bride, seems to presuppose that he has already received her from her
father; and the ceremonies described in chap. 13, the pâ*n*igraha*n*a,
the pronouncing of the Mantra, chap. 13, 4, which reminds one of the
Roman formula ubi tu Gaius, the seven steps—all that should be
understood not as intended to establish the power of the husband over
his wife, but as presupposing that power and showing an exercise of it.
