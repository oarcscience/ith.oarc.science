### KA*ND*IKÂ 13.

1\. Now the entering of a court of justice.

2 <span id="fr_950"></span>[2](#fn_949.md). He approaches the court with
(the words), Court! Thou that belongest to the Aṅgiras! Trouble art thou
by name; vehemence art thou by name. Thus be adoration to thee!

3 <span id="fr_951"></span>[3](#fn_950). He then enters (the court.md) with
(the words), '(May) the court and the assembly, the two unanimous

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

daughters of Pra*g*âpati (protect me). May one who does not know me, be
below me. May (all) people be considerate in what they say.'

4\. When he has arrived at the assembly, he should murmur, 'Superior (to
my adversaries) I have come hither, brilliant, not to be contradicted.
The lord of this assembly is a man insuperable in his power.'

5 <span id="fr_952"></span>[5](#fn_951.md). Should he think, 'This person
is angry with me,' he addresses him with (the verses), The destroying
power of wrath and anger that dwells here on thy forehead, that the
chaste, wise gods may take away.

'Heaven am I and I am Earth; we both take away thy anger; the she-mule
cannot bring forth offspring; N.N.!'

6 <span id="fr_953"></span>[6](#fn_952.md). But if he should think, 'This
person will do evil to me,' he addresses him with (the words), 'I take
away the speech in thy mouth, I take away (the speech) in thy heart.
Wheresoever thy speech dwells, thence I take it away. What I say, is
true. Fall down, inferior to me.'

7\. The same is the way to make (a person) subject (to one's self).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_949"></span>[362:2](sbe29203.htm#fr_950.md) 13, 2. The regular
Sandhi would be sabha (for sabhe) âṅgirasi, instead of which the text
has sabhâṅgirasi.

<span id="fn_950"></span>[362:3](sbe29203.htm#fr_951.md) In Sanskrit the
words sabha (court) and samiti (assembly) are of feminine gender. I have
translated upa ma sa tish*th*et in the sense indicated by Pâ*n*ini I, 4,
87.

<span id="fn_951"></span>[363:5](sbe29203.htm#fr_952.md) Perhaps we should
read garbhe*n*â*s*vataryâ*h* saha: we take away thy anger together with
the offspring of the she-mule (that cannot foal). Comp. *K*ullavagga
VII, 2, 5; S.B.E., XX, 238.

<span id="fn_952"></span>[363:6](sbe29203.htm#fr_953.md) It is impossible
to give a sure restoration of this corrupt Mantra. Perhaps we should
read something like this: â te vâ*k*am âsya â te h*ri*daya âdade. Comp.
Hira*n*y.-G*ri*hya I, 4, 15, 6.
