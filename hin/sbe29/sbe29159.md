Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 5.

1\. Having led her around the fire, keeping it on his right side,
according to some (teachers)—

2\. Having pushed with his right foot a bundle of grass or a mat to the
west of the fire, he sits down.

3 <span id="fr_699"></span>[3](#fn_698). While (the bride.md) touches him,
(the following oblations are made:) the two Âghâra oblations, the two
Â*g*ya portions, the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis, the general expiation, the
Prâ*g*âpatya oblation, and the Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

4\. These are regular (oblations) at every sacrifice.

5\. The Svish*t*ak*ri*t comes before the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis, if the
sacrificial food is different from Â*g*ya.

6 <span id="fr_700"></span>[6](#fn_699.md). The place for the insertion (of
the peculiar oblations belonging to the different sacrifices) is the
interval between the general expiation and the oblation to Pra*g*âpati.

7\. At the wedding (he may make oblations) with the Râsh*t*rabh*ri*t
formulas (i.e. the formulas procuring royal power), if he likes, and
with the *G*aya and Abhyâtâna formulas (i.e. the formulas procuring

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

victory, and aiming \[at the hostile powers\]), if he knows them—

8 <span id="fr_701"></span>[8](#fn_700.md). Because it has been said, 'By
what sacrifice he wishes to attain success.'

9 <span id="fr_702"></span>[9](#fn_701). (The *G*aya formulas run thus.md):
'Thought and thinking. Intention and intending. The understood and
understanding. The mind and the *S*akvarî (verses). The new moon and the
full moon. B*ri*hat and Rathantara.

'Pra*g*âpati, the powerful one in victorious battles, has given
victories (or, the Gaya formulas) to manly Indra. To him all subjects
bowed down; he has become powerful and worthy of sacrifice. Svâhâ!

10 <span id="fr_703"></span>[10](#fn_702.md). (The Abhyâtâna formulas run
thus): 'May Agni, the lord of beings, protect me. May Indra, (the lord)
of the noblest, Yama, of the earth, Vâyu, of the air, the Sun, of
heaven, the Moon, of the Nakshatras, B*ri*haspati, of the Brahman,
Mitra, of truth, Varu*n*a, of the waters, the sea, of the rivers, food,
the lord of royalty, protect me. May Soma, (the lord) of herbs,
Savit*ri*, of impulses, Rudra, of cattle, Tvash*tri*, of forms,
Vish*n*u, of mountains, the Maruts, the lords of hosts, protect me. May
the fathers,

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

the grandfathers, the former, the later, the fathers, the grandfathers
protect me here in this power of holiness, in this worldly power, in
this prayer, in this Purohitaship, in this sacrifice, in this invocation
of the gods. Svâhâ!'—this is added each time.

11\. (He then makes other oblations with the following texts:)

'May Agni come hither, the first of gods. May he release the offspring
of this wife from the fetter of death. That may this king Varu*n*a
grant, that this wife may not weep over distress (falling to her lot)
through her sons. Svâhâ!

'May Agni Gârhapatya protect this woman. May he lead her offspring to
old age. With fertile womb may she be the mother of living children. May
she experience delight in her sons. Svâhâ!

'Make, Agni, all ways of heaven and earth blissful to us, O thou who art
worthy of sacrifices. What is great, born on this (earth); and praised,
(born) in heaven, that bestow on us, rich treasures. Svâhâ!

'Come hither, showing us an easy path. Give us bright, undecaying life.
May death go away; may immortality come to us. May Vivasvat's son make
us safe from danger. Svâhâ!

12\. And the (verse), 'Another way, O death' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXXV, 7),
after the eating (of the remnant of the sacrificial food), according to
some (teachers).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_698"></span>[279:3](sbe29159.htm#fr_699.md) 5, 3. See the note
on *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 9, 12.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[279:6](sbe29159.htm#fr_700.md) See the note
l.l.—I have altered the division of Sûtras 6 and 7, so as to draw the
word vivâhe to the seventh Sûtra. The rule in § 6 has an entirely
general character; the formulas stated in § 7 are given for the
particular occasion of the vivâha ceremony.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[280:8](sbe29159.htm#fr_701.md) Taittirîya
Sa*m*hitâ III, 4, 6, 1: 'By what sacrifice he wishes to attain success,
at that (sacrifice) he should make oblations with them (i.e. with the
Abhyâtâna Mantras): then he will attain success by that sacrifice.'

<span id="fn_701"></span>[280:9](sbe29159.htm#fr_702.md) Instead of sa i
havya*h* we ought to read probably sa u havya*h*, or, as the Taitt.
Sa*m*h. III, 4, 4, 1 gives, sa hi havya*h*. The Maitr. Sa*m*h. has
vihavya*h* (II, 10, 2).

<span id="fn_702"></span>[280:10](sbe29159.htm#fr_703.md) The words, 'in
this power of holiness . . . svâhâ!' are to be added to each member of
the whole formula (comp. Atharva-veda V, 24). The expressions 'fathers'
and 'grandfathers,' which are twice identically repeated in the
translation, stand the first time for pitara*h* pitâmahâ*h*, and then
for tatâs tatâmahâ*h* of the Sanskrit text.
