<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

9\. And when the teacher has died, for ten days;

10\. When he has heard of it, for three days;

11 <span id="fr_264"></span>[11](#fn_263). And (on the death) of those

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

52\. Should any of these cases arise against his will, let him (continue
to) recite after having held his breath and looked at the sun.

53 <span id="fr_269"></span>[53](#fn_268). (The same rules hold good,)
except (those regarding) lightning, thunder, and rain, for (the study
of) the Kalpa. During the five months and a half (they have to behave)
as while it rains.

54\. Thereof it is also said,

55 <span id="fr_270"></span>[55](#fn_269). 'Food, water, roots and
fruits, and whatsoever else *S*râddha-food there may be: even when he
has (only) accepted thereof, the study should be interrupted; the
Brâhma*n*a's hand is his mouth; so it is taught.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_259"></span>[115:2](sbe29069.htm#fr_260) 7, 2. The
translation of âkâlam given in my German edition (Während der
betreffenden Zeit) is wrong: comp. the commentary there quoted at p.
150; Gautama XVI, 22; Professor Stenzler's note on Pâraskara II, II, 2.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[115:7\_6](sbe29069.htm#fr_261) Agha*m*
sapi*nd*asodakayor mara*n*a*m*. Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[115:7](sbe29069.htm#fr_262) According to
Nârâya*n*a the *k*a at the end of this Sûtra would <span
id="page_116">p. 116</span> be intended to convey the meaning that on
the pratipad days of each fortnight the study should also be
interrupted.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[116:8](sbe29069.htm#fr_263) The translation of
nabhya is quite conjectural. Nârâya*n*a gives a different meaning to
this word; comp. p. 150 of the German edition.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[116:11](sbe29069.htm#fr_264)
Â*k*âryaputrâdaya*h*. Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[116:21](sbe29069.htm#fr_265) The reason why
the recitation of the Rig-veda is forbidden when the sound of a Sâman is
heard, becomes manifest, for instance, from Âpastamba I, to, 7, where
the discontinuance of the Veda-study is prescribed when the barking of
dogs, the braying of asses, the cry of a wolf, &c., the sound of musical
instruments, of weeping, and of a Sâman is heard. Loud sounds like these
would disturb the recitation of *Rik* or Ya*g*us texts. A very curious
opinion has been recently brought forward by Professor Aufrecht (see his
edition of the Rig-veda, second edition, vol. ii, p. xxxviii) that the
incompatibility of the recitation of *Rik* hymns and of Sâmans 'beruht
auf der Kenntniss von der Willkür and der zum Theil unwürdigen Weise, in
welcher der alte Text des Rig-veda in diesem Gesangbuche (i.e. the
Sâmavedâr*k*ika) behandelt ist.'

<span id="fn_265"></span>[117:23](sbe29069.htm#fr_266) Grâmâra*n*ye
grâmam (read, grâma?) evâra*n*ya*m* vana*m* tatra nâdhîyîta. Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[117:29](sbe29069.htm#fr_267) Except during the
rainy season. Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[117:45](sbe29069.htm#fr_268) Nârâya*n*a also
understands maithuna, and I think that the German translation ought to
be corrected accordingly.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[118:53](sbe29069.htm#fr_269) I think that this
Sûtra contains two different rules which have to be separated, viz. 1.
vidyutstanayitnuvarshavar*g*a*m* kalpe; 2. varshavad ardhashash*th*eshu.
The first of these rules would extend the cases of anadhyâya mentioned
in this chapter to the study of the Kalpa-sûtra, except the cases of
lightning, rain, &c. The second would refer to the five months and a
half following on the Utsarga ceremony (comp. chap. 6, 8), and would
imply that during this time the same texts are to be studied or not,
according as their study is allowed or forbidden during rainfall: i.e.
the study of the Sa*m*hitâ is to be discontinued, while that of the
Kalpa is allowed to go on. Râma*k*andra and Nârâya*n*a differ from this
interpretation; see p. 151 of the German edition.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[118:55](sbe29069.htm#fr_270) Comp. Manu IV,
117; Vasish*th*a XIII, 16.
