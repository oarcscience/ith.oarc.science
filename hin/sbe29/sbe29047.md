house) without receiving honour takes away all his good works.

2\. 'One should give (even) if it were only a water-pot; one should
sacrifice (even) if it were a piece of wood; (even) down to one hymn or
to one Anuvâka the Brahmaya*gñ*a is enjoined.

3\. 'When on a journey let him not fast; (during that time) the wife
keeps the vow. Let his son, his brother, or his wife, or his pupil offer

4\. 'Those who perform this Vai*s*vadeva sacrifice in the evening and in
the morning, they will prosper in wealth and (long) life, in fame and
offspring.'
