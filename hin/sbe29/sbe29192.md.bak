### KA*ND*IKÂ 2.

1\. On the full-moon day of Mârga*s*îrsha the Âgrahâya*n*î ceremony (is
performed).

2 <span id="fr_871"></span>[2](#fn_870.md). He cooks a mess of sacrificial
food, sacrifices two Â*g*ya oblations as at the *S*rava*n*â sacrifice,
and other oblations with (the following verses):

'The night whom men welcome like a cow that comes to them, (the night)
which is the consort of the year, may that (night) be auspicious to us.
Svâhâ!

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

'The night which is the image of the year, that we worship. May I reach
old age, imparting strength to my offspring. Svâhâ!

'To the Sa*m*vatsara, to the Parivatsara, to the Idâvatsara, to the
Idâvatsara, to the Vatsara bring ye great adoration. May we, undecayed,
unbeaten, long enjoy the favour of these (years) which are worthy of
sacrifices. Svâhâ!

'May summer, winter and spring, the rains be friendly, and may autumn be
free of danger to us. In the safe protection of these seasons may we
dwell, (and) may (they) last (to us) through a hundred years. Svâhâ!'

3\. He makes oblations of the cooked food to Soma, to (the Nakshatra)
M*ri*ga*s*iras, to the full moon of Mârga*s*îrsha, and to the winter.

4 <span id="fr_872"></span>[4](#fn_871.md). After he has eaten (of the
sacrificial food), he throws the remainder of the flour into a basket,
(and then follow the same rites that have been stated above) from (the
sacrificer's) going out down to their cleaning themselves.

5\. After the cleaning he says, 'The Bali offering is finished.'

6 <span id="fr_873"></span>[6](#fn_872.md). After they have spread out to
the west of the fire a layer (of straw) and a garment that has

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

not yet been washed, they 'redescend,' having bathed, wearing garments
which have not yet been washed: the master (of the house) southward, his
wife to the north (of her husband, and then the other persons belonging
to the house) so that each younger one lies more to the north.

7\. Having caused the Brahman to sit down southward, and having placed
to the north a water-pot, a *S*amî branch, an earth-clod taken out of a
furrow, and a stone, he murmurs, looking at the fire: 'This Agni is most
valiant, he is most blessed, the best giver of a thousand boons, highly
powerful. May he establish us both in the highest place.'

8\. To the west of the fire he joins his hands (and holds them) towards
the east.

9\. With the three (verses), 'The divine ship' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXI, 6-8)
they ascend the layer (of straw).

10 <span id="fr_874"></span>[10-11](#fn_873.md). He addresses the Brahman:
'Brahman, we will redescend.'

11\. The Brahman having given his permission, they redescend with (the
words), 'Life, fame, glory, strength, enjoyment of food, offspring!'

12 <span id="fr_875"></span>[12](#fn_874.md). Those who have received the
initiation murmur, 'May a good winter, a good spring, a good summer be
bestowed on us. Blessed may be to us the rains; may the autumns be
blessed to us.'

13\. With (the verse), 'Be soft to us, O earth' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXXV,
21), they lie down on their right sides, their heads turned towards the
east.

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

14 <span id="fr_876"></span>[14](sbe29193.htm#fn_875.md). They arise with
(the verse), 'Up! with life, with blessed life. Up! with Par*g*anya's
eye, with the seven spaces of the earth.'

15\. This (they repeat) two other times, with the Brahman's permission.

16\. Let them sleep on the ground four months (after the
Pratyavaroha*n*a), or as long as they like.

<span id="fn_870"></span>[338:2](sbe29192.htm#fr_871.md) 2, 2. The two
oblations belonging to the *S*rava*n*â ceremony are those stated above,
II, 14, 4. 5.

2\. The first verses in which the Âgrahâya*n*î night is called the
consort of the year, or the image of the year, occur elsewhere with
reference to the Ekâsh*t*akâ night. See Atharva-veda III, 10; Taitt.
<span id="page_339">p. 339</span> Sa*m*hitâ V, 7, 2, 1. See also below,
Pâraskara III, 3, 5. Sa*m*vatsara, Parivatsara, Idâvatsara, &c. are
terms designating the different years of the quinquennial period of the

<span id="fn_872"></span>[339:6](sbe29192.htm#fr_873.md) 'Redescending'
means that they do not sleep any longer on high bedsteads, which they
did from the *S*râvanî day till the Âgrahâya*n*î, on account of the
danger from the snakes, but on the ground. See the notes on
Sâṅkh.-G*ri*hya IV, 15, 22; 17, 1.

<span id="fn_873"></span>[340:10-11](sbe29192.htm#fr_874.md) 10, 11. See
