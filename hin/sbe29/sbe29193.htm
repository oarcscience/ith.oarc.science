<P><A NAME="fn_875"></A><A HREF="sbe29192.htm#fr_876">341:14</A> The verse occurs, with a few differences, in the K&acirc;<I>n</I>va <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>. Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, II, 7, 5.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_876"></A><A HREF="sbe29193.htm#fr_877">341:1</A> 3, 1. On the Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc;s, celebrated on the eighth days of the three dark fortnights following after the &Acirc;grah&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc; full moon, see <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana III, 12 seqq.; &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana II, 4; Gobhila III, 10.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_877"></A><A HREF="sbe29193.htm#fr_878">341:2</A> As there are four deities named, I think it probable that they are referred to all Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc;s indiscriminately; comp. &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana II, 4, 12. Thus in the Mantras prescribed for the first Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc; (S&ucirc;tras 5 and 6), Indra, the Vi<I>s</I>ve dev&acirc;s, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati are named; to the Fathers belongs the Anvash<I>t</I>akya ceremony.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_881"></A><A HREF="sbe29193.htm#fr_882">342:d</A> (d) Probably one Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc; addresses the others, her sisters, as <I>G</I>ayar&acirc;ma explains this verse.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_882"></A><A HREF="sbe29193.htm#fr_883">342:f</A> (f) The explanation by which the 'fivefold milking' is referred to what is called in Taitt. Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a II, 2, 9, 'the milkings of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati,' seems to me more than doubtful, for 'the milkings <A NAME="page_342"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 342</FONT></A> of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati' are only four: viz. the dark night, the moonlight, the twilight, and the day.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_883"></A><A HREF="sbe29193.htm#fr_884">343:i</A> (i) Sukra-<I>ri</I>shabh&acirc; cannot be translated, as Professor Stenzler does, 'die sch&ouml;nste unter den Lichtern' (M&acirc;dhava: <I>s</I>ukreshu nakshatr&acirc;dishu <I>s</I>resh<I>th</I>&acirc;), for this meaning of <I>ri</I>shabh&acirc; occurs only in later texts. The word is a Bahuvr&icirc;hi compound, as the Petersburg Dictionary explains it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_884"></A><A HREF="sbe29193.htm#fr_885">343:6</A> In the first verse I have omitted vya<I>s</I>navai, which impedes the construction and violates the metre. The word has found its way into the text, no doubt, in consequence of the phrase d&icirc;rgham &acirc;yur vya<I>s</I>navai occurring in chap. 2, 2. In the second verse <A NAME="page_344"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 344</FONT></A> ak<I>ri</I>tad is corrupt. I have translated abhayam; comp. &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana II, 4, 14. In the third verse I have left out mayi, as Professor Stenzler has done in his translation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_885"></A><A HREF="sbe29193.htm#fr_886">345:13</A> I have stated in the note on <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana III, 13, 1 my reasons for believing that the true reading of this S&ucirc;tra is not madhy&acirc;varshe (in the middle of the rainy season), but m&acirc;ghyavarshe (the festival celebrated during the rainy season under the Nakshatra Magh&acirc;s). There are no express rules given with regard to the third Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc;, but I think we should understand this S&ucirc;tra as involving a statement on that Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc;: (The third Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc;) and the fourth, on the M&acirc;ghyavarsha day, are S&acirc;k&acirc;sh<I>t</I>ak&acirc;s (Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc;s on which vegetables are offered). <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana (G<I>ri</I>hya III, 13, 1) declares that the ritual of the fourth Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc; is identical with that of the second.</P>
