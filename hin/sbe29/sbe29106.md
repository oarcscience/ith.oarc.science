### KA*ND*IKÂ 7.

1\. Now various indeed are the customs of the (different) countries and
the customs of the (different) villages: those one should observe at the
wedding.

2\. What, however, is commonly accepted, that we shall state.

3 <span id="fr_389"></span>[3](#fn_388). Having placed to the west of
the fire a mill-stone, to the north-east (of the fire) a water-pot, he
should sacrifice, while she takes hold of him. Standing, with his face
turned to the west, while she is sitting and turns her face to the east,
he should with (the formula), 'I seize thy hand for the sake of
happiness seize her thumb if he desires that only male children may be
born to him;

4\. Her other fingers, (if he is) desirous of female (children);

5\. The hand on the hair-side together with the

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

thumb, (if) desirous of both (male and female children).

6 <span id="fr_390"></span>[6](#fn_389). Leading her three times round
the fire and the water-pot, so that their right sides are turned towards
(the fire, &c.), he murmurs, 'This am I, that art thou; that art thou,
this am I; the heaven I, the earth thou; the Sâman I, the *Rik* thou.
Come! Let us here marry. Let us beget offspring. Loving, bright, with
genial mind may we live a hundred autumns.'

7 <span id="fr_391"></span>[7](#fn_390). Each time after he has lead her
(so) round, he makes her tread on the stone with (the words), 'Tread on
this stone; like a stone be firm. Overcome the enemies; tread the foes
down.'

8 <span id="fr_392"></span>[8](#fn_391). Having 'spread under' (i.e.
having first poured Â*g*ya over her hands), her brother or a person
acting in her brother's place pours fried grain twice over the wife's
joined hands.

9 <span id="fr_393"></span>[9](#fn_392). Three times for descendants of
*G*amadagni.

10\. He pours again (Â*g*ya) over (what has been left of) the
sacrificial food,

11\. And over what has been cut off.

12\. This is the rule about the portions to be cut off.

13 <span id="fr_394"></span>[13](#fn_393). 'To god Aryaman the girls
have made sacrifice,

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

to Agni; may he, god Aryaman, loosen her from this, and not from that
place, Svâhâ!

'To god Varu*n*a the girls have made sacrifice, to Agni; may he, god
Varu*n*a, &c.

'To god Pûshan the girls have made sacrifice, to Agni; may he, god
Pûshan, &c.'—with (these verses recited by the bridegroom) she should
sacrifice (the fried grain) without opening her joined hands, as if (she
did so) with the (spoon called) Sru*k*.

14 <span id="fr_395"></span>[14-15](#fn_394). Without that leading round
(the fire, she sacrifices grain) with the neb of a basket towards
herself silently a fourth time.

15\. Some lead the bride round each time after the fried grain has been
poured out: thus the two last oblations do not follow immediately on
each other.

16\. He then loosens her two locks of hair, if they are made, (i.e. if)
two tufts of wool are bound round her hair on the two sides,

17\. With (the *Rik*),'I release thee from the band of Varu*n*a'
(Rig-veda X, 85, 24).

18\. The left one with the following (*Rik*).

19 <span id="fr_396"></span>[19](#fn_395). He then causes her to step
forward in a northeastern direction seven steps with (the words), 'For
sap with one step, for juice with two steps, for thriving of wealth with
three steps, for comfort with four steps, for offspring with five steps,
for the seasons

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

with six steps. Be friend with seven steps. So be thou devoted to me.
Let us acquire many sons who may reach old age!'

20 <span id="fr_397"></span>[20](#fn_396). Joining together their two
heads, (the bridegroom? the Â*k*ârya?) sprinkles them (with water) from
the water-pot.

21\. And she should dwell that night in the house of an old Brâhma*n*a
woman whose husband is alive and whose children are alive.

22 <span id="fr_398"></span>[22](#fn_397). When she sees the polar-star,
the star Arundhatî, and the seven *Ri*shis (ursa major), let her break
the silence (and say), 'May my husband live and I get offspring.'

<span id="fn_388"></span>[167:3](sbe29106.htm#fr_389) 7, 3. Professor
Stenzler is evidently right in taking a*s*mânam as in apposition to
d*ri*shadam. Nârâya*n*a says, d*ri*shat prasiddhâ a*s*mâ tatputraka*h*.
tatrobhayo*h* pratish*th*âpana*m* siddham.

The sacrifice is that prescribed in Sâṅkh.-G*ri*hya I, 12, II. 12.
Regarding the rite that follows, comp. Sâṅkh.-G*ri*hya I, 13, 2.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[168:6](sbe29106.htm#fr_390)
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 13, 4. 9. 13.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[168:8](sbe29106.htm#fr_392)
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 13, 15. 16.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[168:9](sbe29106.htm#fr_393) The two portions
of fried grain poured over the bride's hands, together with the first
(upastara*n*a) and the second (pratyabhighâra*n*a) pouring out of
Â*g*ya, constitute the four Avattas, or portions cut off from the Havis.
The descendants of *G*amadagni were pa*ñk*âvattinas, i.e. they used to
cut off five such portions (see Kâtyâyana I, 9, 3; Weber, Indische
Studien, X, 95); so they had to pour out the fried grain three times.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[168:13](sbe29106.htm#fr_394)
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 18, 3; 13, 17; 14, 1.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[169:14-15](sbe29106.htm#fr_395) 14, 15.
According to those teachers whose opinion is related in Sûtras 6-14, the
leading round the fire, the treading on the stone, and the offering of
fried grain (with the three parts of the Mantra, Sûtra 1 3) are repeated
thrice; then follows the offering prescribed in Sûtra 14, so that the
last two offerings follow immediately on each other. This is not the
case, if in the first three instances the order of the different rites
is inverted, as stated in Sûtra 15.

In Sûtra 14 Nârâya*n*a explains *s*ûrpapu*t*a by ko*n*a.
