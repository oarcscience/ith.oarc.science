### KA*ND*IKÂ 11.

1\. In the fourth night (after the wedding), towards morning, (the
husband) establishes the fire within (the house), assigns his seat, to
the south (of it), to the Brahman, places a pot of water to the north,
cooks a mess of sacrificial food, sacrifices the two Â*g*ya portions,
and makes (other) Â*g*ya oblations with (the following Mantras):

2 <span id="fr_724"></span>[2](#fn_723.md). 'Agni! Expiation! Thou art the
expiation of the gods. I, the Brâhma*n*a, entreat thee, desirous of
protection. The substance which dwells in her that brings death to her
husband, that extirpate in her. Svâhâ!

'Vâyu! Expiation! Thou art the expiation of the gods. I, the Brâhma*n*a,
entreat thee, desirous of protection. The substance which dwells in her
that brings death to her children, that extirpate in her. Svâhâ!

'Sûrya! Expiation! Thou art the expiation of the gods. I, the
Brâhma*n*a, entreat thee, desirous of protection. The substance which
dwells in her that brings death to cattle, that extirpate in her. Svâhâ!

'Kandra! Expiation! Thou art the expiation of the gods. I, the
Brâhma*n*a, entreat thee, desirous

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

of protection. The substance which dwells in her that brings destruction
to the house, that extirpate in her. Svâhâ!

'Gandharva! Expiation! Thou art the expiation of the gods. I, the
Brâhma*n*a, entreat thee, desirous of protection. The substance which
dwells in her that brings destruction to fame, that extirpate in her.
Svâhâ!'

3\. He sacrifices of the mess of cooked food with (the words), 'To
Pra*g*âpati svâhâ!'

4 <span id="fr_725"></span>[4](#fn_724.md). Each time after he has
sacrificed, he pours the remainder of the oblations into the water-pot,
and out of that (pot) he besprinkles her on her head with (the words),
'The evil substance which dwells in thee that brings death to thy
husband, death to thy children, death to cattle, destruction to the
house, destruction to fame, that I change into one that brings death to
thy paramour. Thus live with me to old age, N.N.!'

5\. He then makes her eat the mess of cooked food with (the words), 'I
add breath to thy breath, bones to thy bones, flesh to thy flesh, skin
to thy skin.'

6 <span id="fr_726"></span>[6](#fn_725.md). Therefore one should not wish
for sport with the wife of a *S*rotriya who knows this; for the other
one is a person who knows this (and is thereby enabled to destroy a
lover of his wife).

7\. After he has led her to his house, be should cohabit with her after
each of her monthly periods,

8 <span id="fr_727"></span>[8](#fn_726.md). Or as he likes, because it has
been said, 'May we have intercourse as we like, until a child is born.'

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

9 <span id="fr_728"></span>[9](#fn_727.md). He then touches her heart,
(reaching) over her right shoulder, with (the verse), 'O thou whose hair
is well parted! Thy heart that dwells in heaven, in the moon, that I
know; may it know me. May we see a hundred autumns; may we live a
hundred autumns; may we hear a hundred autumns.'

10\. In the same way afterwards.
