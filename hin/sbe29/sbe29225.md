fire, should sweep the coals away (from that surface), and should make

4\. If (the butter) catches fire, twelve villages (will be his).

5\. If smoke rises, at least three.

6\. Let him sacrifice in the evening and in the morning the fallings-off

him make an oblation with (the formula), 'Here (this Vi*s*vakarman),'
(MB. II, 6, 10.)

8\. On the sacrificial day (i.e. on the first day of the fortnight) let
him sacrifice a full oblation (with the verse MB. II, 6, II, 'A full
oblation I sacrifice,' &c.).

formula), 'Indrâmavadât' (?), (MB. II, 6, 12.)

10 <span id="fr_1049"></span>[10-16](#fn_1048). He should fast through a
period of eight nights, and then should kindle a fire to the east or to
the north of the village, at a place where four roads meet. The fuel
should be Udumbara wood, and the Sruva and the cup (for water should be
of the same wood). Let him sacrifice (Â*g*ya) with (the formulas), 'Food
indeed,' and 'Bliss indeed' (MB. II, 6, 13, 14).

11\. A third (oblation) in the village with (the formula), 'The food’s'
(l.l. 15).

12\. Then he will become a ruler.

13\. When (his cows) are sick, let him sacrifice milk-rice in the
cow-stable.

14\. On a dangerous road let him make knots in the skirts of the
garments (of those who travel together). This will bring a prosperous
