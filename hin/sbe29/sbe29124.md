### ADHYÂYA II, KA*ND*IKÂ 1.

1 <span id="fr_485"></span>[1](#fn_484.md). On the full moon day of the
*S*râva*n*a month the *S*râva*n*a ceremony (is performed).

2\. Having filled a new jug with flour of fried barley, he lays (this
jug) and a spoon for offering the Balis on new strings of a carrying
pole (and thus suspends them).

3\. Having prepared fried barley grains, he smears half of them with
butter.

4\. After sunset he prepares a mess of cooked food and a cake in one
dish and sacrifices (the cooked food) with the four verses, 'Agni, lead
us on a good path to wealth' (Rig-veda I, 189, 1 seqq.), verse by verse,
and with his hand the (cake) in one dish with (the formula), 'To the
steady One, the earth-demon, svâhâ!'

5\. (The cake) should be (entirely) immersed (into the butter), or its
back should be visible.

6\. With (the verse), 'Agni, do not deliver us to evil' (Rig-veda I,
189, 5) he sacrifices over it (the butter) in which it had lain.

7 <span id="fr_486"></span>[7-8](#fn_485). With (the verse.md), 'May the
steeds at our invocation be for a blessing to us' (Rig-veda VII, 38, 7)
(he sacrifices) the besmeared grains with his joined hands,

8\. The other (grains) he should give to his people.

9\. Out of the jug he fills the spoon with flour,

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

goes out (of the house) to the east, pours water on the ground on a
clean spot, sacrifices with (the formula), 'To the divine hosts of the
serpents svâhâ!' and does reverence to them with (the formula), 'The
serpents which are terrestrial, which are aerial, which are celestial,
which dwell in the directions (of the horizon)—to them I have brought
this Bali; to them I give over this Bali.'

10\. Having gone round (the Bali) from left to right, he sits down to
the west of the Bali with (the words), 'The serpent art thou; the lord
of the creeping serpents art thou; by food thou protectest men, by cake
the serpents, by sacrifice the gods. To me, being in thee, the serpents
being in thee should do no harm. I give over the firm one (i.e. the
spoon) to thee.'

11\. 'Firm one, (I give) N.N. (in charge) to thee! Firm one, (I give)
N.N. (in charge) to thee!'—with (these words he gives) his people, man
by man, (in charge to the serpent god);

12\. 'Firm one, I give myself in charge to thee!'—with these words
himself at the end.

13\. Let no one step between it (i.e. the Bali, and the sacrificer),
until the giving in charge has been performed.

14 <span id="fr_487"></span>[14](#fn_486). With (the formula.md), 'To the
divine hosts of the serpents svâhâ!'—let him offer the Bali in the
evening and in the morning, till the Pratyavaroha*n*a (i.e. the ceremony
of the 'redescent').

15 <span id="fr_488"></span>[15](#fn_487.md). Some count (the days till the
Pratyavaroha*n*a)

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

and offer the corresponding number of Balis already on that day (on
which the *S*rava*n*â ceremony is performed).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_484"></span>[201:1](sbe29124.htm#fr_485.md) 1, 1. Nârâya*n*a's
observation that the *S*râva*n*a full moon can fall also under certain
other Nakshatras than *S*rava*n*a itself, furnishes no reason why we
should think here of solar months, as Prof. Stenzler proposes.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[201:7-8](sbe29124.htm#fr_486.md) 7, 8. See above,
Sûtra 3. 9. See above, Sûtra 1.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[202:14](sbe29124.htm#fr_487.md) On the
Pratyavaroha*n*a, see the third chapter of this Adhyâya.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[202:15](sbe29124.htm#fr_488.md) I.e. two Bali
offerings for each day, one for the morning and one for the evening.
