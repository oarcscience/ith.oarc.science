*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 17.

1\. In the third year the *K*aula (i.e. the tonsure of the child's
head), or according to the custom of the family.

2\. To the north of the fire he places vessels which are filled
respectively, with rice, barley, beans, and sesamum seeds;

3\. To the west (the boy) for whom the ceremony shall be performed, in
his mother's lap, bull-dung in a new vessel, and *S*amî leaves are
placed.

4 <span id="fr_445"></span>[4](#fn_444). To the south of the mother the
father (is seated) holding twenty-one bunches of Ku*s*a grass.

5\. Or the Brahman should hold them.

6\. To the west of (the boy) for whom the ceremony is to be performed,
(the father) stations himself and pours cold and warm water together
with (the words), 'With warm water, O Vâyu, come hither!'

7\. Taking of that (water), (and) fresh butter, or (some) drops of
curds, he three times moistens (the boy's) head, from the left to the
right, with (the formula), 'May Aditi cut thy hair; may the waters
moisten thee for vigour!'

8 <span id="fr_446"></span>[8](#fn_445). Into the right part (of the
hair) he puts each

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

time three Ku*s*a bunches, with the points towards (the boy) himself,
with (the words), 'Herb! protect him!'

9\. (With the words,) 'Axe! do no harm to him!' he presses a copper
razor (on the Ku*s*a blades),

10\. And cuts (the hair) with (the verse), 'The razor with which in the
beginning Savit*ri* the knowing one has shaved (the beard) of king Soma
and of Varu*n*a, with that, ye Brâhma*n*as, shave now his (hair), that
he may be blessed with long life, with old age.'

11\. Each time that he has cut, he gives (the hairs) with their points
to the east, together with *S*amî leaves, to the mother. She puts them
down on the bull-dung.

12\. 'With what Dhât*ri* has shaven (the head) of B*ri*haspati, Agni and
Indra, for the sake of long life, with that I shave thy (head) for the
sake of long life, of glory, and of welfare'—thus a second time.

13 <span id="fr_447"></span>[13](#fn_446). 'By what he may at night
further see the sun, and see it long, with that I shave thy (head) for
the sake of long life, of glory, and of welfare'—thus a third time.

14\. With all (the indicated) Mantras a fourth time.

15\. Thus three times on the left side (of the head).

16 <span id="fr_448"></span>[16](#fn_447). Let him wipe off the edge of
the razor with (the words), 'If thou shavest, as a shaver, his hair with
the razor, the wounding, the well-shaped, purify his head, but do not
take away his life.'

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

17\. Let him give orders to the barber, 'With lukewarm water doing what
has to be done with water, without doing harm to him, arrange (his hair)
well.'

18 <span id="fr_449"></span>[18](#fn_448). Let him have the arrangement
of the hair made according to the custom of his family.

19\. The rite only (without the Mantras) for a girl.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_444"></span>[184:4](sbe29116.htm#fr_445) He cuts off the
hair four times on the right side (Sûtras 10-14), three times on the
left side (Sûtra 15); each time three Ku*s*a bunches are required. This
is the reason why twenty-one bunches are prescribed.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[184:8](sbe29116.htm#fr_446) Each of the four
times and of the three times respectively that he cuts off the hair; see
the preceding note.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[185:13](sbe29116.htm#fr_447) Instead of yena
bhûya*s* *k*a râtryâm, Pâraskara (II, 1, 16) has, yena bhûri*s* *k*arâ
divam.

II, I, 19; Atharva-veda VIII, 2, 17.
