### KHA*ND*A 12.

1 <span id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_222.md). After the Âgrahâya*n*î (or the
full moon day of the month Mârga*s*îrsha) (follow) the three Ash*t*akâs
in the second fortnight (of the Mârga*s*îrsha and of the two following
months).

2\. At the first of these he sacrifices vegetables,

shone forth first is this (earth); she walks, having entered into this
(earth). The wife has brought forth (children), the new-creating mother.
May the three powers follow her. Svâhâ!'

4\. Now (the oblation for Agni) Svish*t*ak*ri*t,

Yama, the son of Vivasvat, and all gods are contained, the Ash*t*akâ
whose face is turned to all sides, she has satiated my desires.

'They call thy teeth "the pressing-stones;" thy

Adoration to thee, O glad-faced one! Svâhâ!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_222"></span>[102:1](sbe29060.htm#fr_223.md) 12, 1. On the
Ash*t*akâ festivals, of which some texts reckon three, while others have
four, comp. Weber, Naxatra (second article), pp. 337, 341 seq.; Bühler,
S.B.E., II, p. 214; Ludwig, Rig-veda, vol. iv, pp. 424 seq.;
Atharva-veda III, 10. The last Ash*t*akâ, which is celebrated in the
dark fortnight of Mâgha, is called Ekâsh*t*akâ; this Ash*t*akâ is called
the 'wife of the year,' 'the image of the year,' 'the disposer of the
days.' If the Phâlguna month is reckoned as the first of the year, this
Ash*t*akâ precedes the year's beginning only by a few days; there are
also some Vedic passages which point to the Ekâsh*t*akâ's following
shortly after the beginning of the year; see Weber, loc. cit., p. 342.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[102:3](sbe29060.htm#fr_224.md) Instead of
navak*ri*t the parallel texts (except the Mantrabrâhma*n*a II, 2, 12)
have navagat, which is explained by nûtanavivâhavatî (Ludwig, loc.
cit.); the 'three powers' are understood by Mâdhava (in the commentary
on Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 3, 11) as Agni, Sûrya, and *K*andra.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[102:5](sbe29060.htm#fr_225.md) After pavamâna*h*
there is evidently a word wanting that <span id="page_103">p. 103</span>
indicated the limb of the Ash*t*akâ's body identified with the months
and half-months.
