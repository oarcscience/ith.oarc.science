*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 10.

1\. Now the oblations of cooked food on the (two) Parvan (i.e. the new
and full moon) days.

2\. The fasting (which takes place) thereat has been declared by (the
corresponding rules regarding) the Dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa sacrifices.

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

3 <span id="fr_409"></span>[3](#fn_408). And (so has been declared) the
binding together of the fuel and of the Barhis,

4 <span id="fr_410"></span>[4](#fn_409). And the deities (to whom those
oblations belong), with the exception of the Upâ*ms*uyâ*g*a (offerings
at which the formulas are repeated with low voice), and of Indra and
Mahendra.

5\. Other deities (may be worshipped) according to the wishes (which the
sacrificer connects with his offerings).

6\. For each single deity he pours out four handsful (of rice, barley,
&c.), placing two purifiers (i.e. Ku*s*a blades, on the vessel), with
(the formula), 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I pour thee out.'

7\. He then sprinkles them (those four portions of Havis with water) in
the same way as he had poured them out, with (the formula), 'Agreeable
to such and such (a deity) I sprinkle thee.'

8\. When (the rice or barley grains) have been husked and cleansed from
the husks three times, let him cook (the four portions) separately,

9\. Or throwing (them) together.

10\. If he cooks them separately, let him touch the grains, after he has
separated them, (and say,) 'This to this god; this to this god.'

11\. But if he (cooks the portions) throwing (them) together, he should
(touch and) sacrifice them, after he has put (the single portions) into
different vessels.

12 <span id="fr_411"></span>[12](#fn_410). The portions of sacrificial
food, when they

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

have been cooked, he sprinkles (with Â*g*ya, takes them from the fire
towards the north, places them on the Barhis, and sprinkles the fuel
with Â*g*ya with the formula, 'This fuel is thy self, *G*âtavedas;
thereby burn thou and increase, and, O burning One, make us increase and
through offspring, cattle, holy lustre, and nourishment make us prosper.
Svâhâ!'

13 <span id="fr_412"></span>[13](#fn_411). Having silently poured out
the two Âghâras (or Â*g*ya oblations poured out with the Sruva, the one
from north-west to south-east, the other from south-west to north-east),
he should sacrifice the two Â*g*ya portions with (the formulas), 'To
Agni svâhâ! To Soma svâhâ!'—

14 <span id="fr_413"></span>[14](#fn_412). The northern one belonging to
Agni, the southern one to Soma.

15 <span id="fr_414"></span>[15](#fn_413). It is understood (in the
*S*ruti), The two eyes indeed of the sacrifice are the Â*g*ya portions,

16 <span id="fr_415"></span>[16](#fn_414). 'Therefore of a man who is
sitting with his face to the west the southern (i.e. right) eye is
northern, the northern (i.e. left) eye is southern.'

17 <span id="fr_416"></span>[17](#fn_415). In the middle (of the two
Â*g*ya portions he

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

sacrifices the other) Havis, or more to the west, finishing (the
oblations) in the east or in the north.

18\. To the north-east the oblation to (Agni) Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

19 <span id="fr_417"></span>[19-20](#fn_416). He cuts off (the Avadâna
portions) from the Havis from the middle and from the eastern part;

20\. From the middle, the eastern part and the western part (the
portions have to be cut off) by those who make five Avadânas;

21\. From the northern side the portion for Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

22 <span id="fr_418"></span>[22](#fn_417). Here he omits the second
pouring (of Â*g*ya) over (what is left of) the sacrificial food.

23 <span id="fr_419"></span>[23](#fn_418). 'What I have done too much in
this ceremony, or what I have done here too little, all that may Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t, he who knows it, make well sacrificed and well offered
for me. To Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t, to him who offers the oblations for
general expiation, so that they are well offered, to him who makes us
succeed in what we desire! Make us in all that we desire successful!
Svâhâ!'

24 <span id="fr_420"></span>[24](#fn_419). He pours out the full vessel
on the Barhis.

25 <span id="fr_421"></span>[25](#fn_420). This is the Avabh*ri*tha.

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

26\. This is the standard form of the Pâkaya*gñ*as.

27\. What has been left of the Havis is the fee for the sacrifice.

Â*s*valâyana-*S*rauta I, 3, 28 Scholion; Kâty.-*S*rauta II, 7, 22.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[173:4](sbe29109.htm#fr_410) See Hillebrandt,
Das altindische Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. 111; my note on
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 3, 3.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[173:12](sbe29109.htm#fr_411) In the Mantra we
have a similar play upon words (iddha, <span id="page_174">p. 174</span>
lit, or burning, and samedhaya, make us prosper) as in *S*âṅkh.-G*ri*hya
II, 10, 4.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[174:13](sbe29109.htm#fr_412) Pâraskara I, 5,

<span id="fn_413"></span>[174:15](sbe29109.htm#fr_414) Professor
Stenzler here very pertinently refers to *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a I, 6, 3,
38.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[174:16](sbe29109.htm#fr_415) It is doubtful
whether this paragraph should be considered as forming part of the
quotation from the *S*ruti. The object of this passage is, in my
opinion, to explain why the southern Â*g*yabhâga belongs to Soma, who is
the presiding deity of the north, and the northern Â*g*yabhâga to Agni,
the presiding deity of the south-east. Professor Stenzler's opinion
about this paragraph is somewhat different.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[174:17](sbe29109.htm#fr_416) *S*âṅkh.-G*ri*hya

above, the note on I, 7, 9 about the Avadâna portions and the peculiar
custom of the descendants of *G*amadagni with regard to them.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[175:22](sbe29109.htm#fr_418) Comp. above, I,
7, 10. 'Here' means, at the Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation.

general expiation (sarvaprâya*sk*ittâhuti) comp. Sâṅkh.-G*ri*hya I, 9,

<span id="fn_419"></span>[175:24](sbe29109.htm#fr_420) 'A full vessel
which has been put down before, he should now pour out on the Barhis.'
Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[175:25](sbe29109.htm#fr_421) This pouring out
of the vessel holds here the place of the Avabh*ri*tha bath at the end
of the Soma sacrifice. See Weber, Indische Studien, X, 393 seq.
