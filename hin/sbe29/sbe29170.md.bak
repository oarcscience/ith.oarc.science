Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 16.

1 <span id="fr_741"></span>[1](#fn_740.md). Soshyantîm adbhir abhyukshaty
e*g*atu da*s*amâsya iti (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. VIII, 28) prâg yasyai to iti
(ibid. 29).

2 <span id="fr_742"></span>[2](#fn_741.md) Athâvarâvapatanam, avaitu
p*ris*ni *s*evala*m* *s*une *g*arâyv attave, naiva mâ*m*sena pîvari na
kasmi*ms* *k*anâyatam ava *g*arâyu padyatâm iti.

3\. When the boy is born, he performs for him, before the navel-string
is cut off, the medhâ*g*anana

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (production of
intelligence) and the âyushya (rite for procuring long life).

4 <span id="fr_743"></span>[4](#fn_742.md). (The medhâ*g*anana is performed
in the following way:) With his fourth finger and with (an instrument
of) gold he gives (to the child) honey and ghee, or ghee (alone), to eat
with (the formulas), 'Bhû*h* I put into thee; bhuva*h* I put into thee;
sva*h* I put into thee. Bhûr bhuva*h* sva*h* everything I put into
thee.'

5\. He then performs the âyushya.

6\. Near his navel or his right ear he murmurs: 'Agni is long-lived;
through the trees he is long-lived. By that long life I make thee
long-lived.

'Soma is long-lived; through the herbs he is, &c.

'The Brahman is long-lived; through the Brâhma*n*as it is, &c.

'The gods are long-lived; through ambrosia (am*ri*ta) they are, &c.

'The *Ri*shis are long-lived; through their observances they are, &c.

'The Fathers are long-lived; through the Svadhâ oblations (or oblations
made to the Manes) they are, &c.

'Sacrifice is long-lived; through sacrificial fee it is, &c.

'The ocean is long-lived; through the rivers it is long-lived. By that
long life I make thee long-lived;'

7\. And three times the verse, 'The threefold age' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. III,
62).

8\. If he desires, 'May he live his full term of

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

life,' he should touch him with the Vâtsapra hymn (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XII,
18-29).

9\. From the Anuvâka beginning with 'From heaven' (XII, 18 seqq.) he
omits the last *Rik* (XII, 29).

10\. Having placed five Brâhma*n*as towards the (five) regions, he
should say to them, 'Breathe ye upon this (child).'

11 <span id="fr_744"></span>[11](#fn_743). The (Brâhma*n*a placed.md) to
the east should say, Up-breathing!

12\. The one to the south, 'Back-breathing!'

13\. The one to the west, 'Down-breathing!'

14\. The one to the north, 'Out-breathing!'

15\. The fifth one, looking upwards, should say, 'On-breathing!'

16\. Or (the father) may do that himself, going round (his child), if he
can find no (Brâhma*n*as).

17 <span id="fr_745"></span>[17](#fn_744.md). He recites over the place at
which (the child) is born: 'I know, O earth, thy heart that dwells in
heaven, in the moon. That I know; may it know me. May we see a hundred
autumns; may we live a hundred autumns; may we hear a hundred autumns.'

18 <span id="fr_746"></span>[18](#fn_745.md). He then touches him with (the
verse), 'Be a stone, be an axe, be imperishable gold. Thou indeed art
the Self called son; thus live a hundred autumns.'

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

19 <span id="fr_747"></span>[19](#fn_746.md). He then recites over his
mother (the verse), 'Thou art I*d*â, the daughter of Mitra and Varu*n*a;
thou strong woman hast born a strong son. Be thou blessed with strong
children, thou who hast blessed us with a strong son.'

20\. He then washes her right breast, and gives it to the child with
(the verse), 'This breast' (Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XVII, 87);

21 <span id="fr_748"></span>[21](#fn_747). The left (breast.md) with (the
verse), 'Thy breast which' (ibid. XXXVIII, 5)—with these two (verses).

22\. He puts down a pot of water near her head with (the verse), 'O
waters, you watch with the gods. As you watch with the gods, thus watch
over this mother who is confined, and her child.'

23 <span id="fr_749"></span>[23](#fn_748.md). Having established near the
door the fire that has been kept from (the wife's) confinement, he
throws into that fire at the time of the morning and evening twilight,
until (the mother) gets up (from childbed), mustard seeds mixed with
rice chaff (pronouncing the following names of demons and goblins): 'May
*S*a*nd*a and Marka, Upavîra, *S*au*nd*ikeya, Ulûkhala, Malimlu*k*a,
Dro*n*âsa, *K*yavana vanish hence. Svâhâ!

'May Âlikhat, Animisha, Ki*m*vadanta, Upa*s*ruti, Haryaksha, Kumbhin,
*S*atru, Pâtrapâ*n*i, N*ri*ma*n*i, Hantrîmukha, Sarshapâru*n*a,
*K*yavana vanish hence. Svâhâ!'

24 <span id="fr_750"></span>[24](#fn_749.md). If (the demon bringing
disease) Kumâra attacks the boy, the father covers him with a net

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

or with an upper garment, takes him on his lap, and murmurs: Kûrkura,
Sukûrkura, Kûrkura, who holds fast children. *K*et! *k*et! doggy! let
him loose. Reverence be to thee, the Sîsara, barker, bender.

'That is true that the gods have given a boon to thee. Hast thou then
chosen even this boy?

'*K*et! *k*et! doggy! let him loose. Reverence be to thee, the Sîsara,
barker, bender.

'That is true that (the divine she-dog) Saramâ is thy mother, Sîsara thy
father, the black and the speckled (two dogs of Yama) thy brothers.

'*K*et! *k*et! doggy! let him loose. Reverence be to thee, the Sîsara,
barker, bender.'

25\. He then touches (the boy) with (the words), 'He does not suffer, he
does not cry, he is not stiff, he is not sick, when we speak to him and
when we touch him.'

literally is: with the nameless (or fourth) finger, between which (and

translating the technical terms for the different kinds of breath, I
adopt the expressions chosen by Professor Max Müller, S.B.E., XV, 94. As
to the whole rite, comp. *S*atap. Br. XI, 8, 3, 6.

11, 9. The comparison of the parallel Mantra leaves scarcely any doubt
that veda (the first word of the verse) is the first, not the third
person, and bhûmi the vocative case. Compare the vocative darvi of the
Vâ*g*. Sa*m*hitâ, while the Atharva-veda has darve. Lanman,
Noun-Inflection, p. 390.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[296:24](sbe29170.htm#fr_750.md) Kûrkura seems to
me, and this is also Professor Stenzler's <span id="page_297">p.
297</span> opinion, identical with kurkura, kukkura ('dog'). The
Petersburg Dictionary explains it, 'Name eines die Kinder bedrohenden
Dämons (vielleicht eine Personification des Hustens).'
