------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 7.

1\. We shall state the rules of conduct for a Snâtaka.

2\. Another (may observe those rules) optionally.

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

3 <span id="fr_802"></span>[3](#fn_801.md). Dancing, singing, and playing
musical instruments, let him neither perform himself nor go (to see or
hear it).

4 <span id="fr_803"></span>[4](#fn_802.md). Sing, however, he may at his
pleasure, for there is another saying, 'He sings either or he rejoices
in (other people's) singing.'

5 <span id="fr_804"></span>[5](#fn_803.md). If everything goes well, he
shall not go by night to another village, and shall not run.

6 <span id="fr_805"></span>[6](#fn_804.md). He shall avoid looking into a
well, climbing up a tree, gathering fruits, crawling through narrow
openings, bathing naked, jumping over uneven ground, using harsh
language, looking at the sun while it is rising or setting, and begging.
For there is a *S*ruti: 'After he has bathed, he should not beg. For he
who bathes, drives away from himself begging.'

7\. If it rains, he shall go without an upper garment, and shall say,
'May this, my thunderbolt, drive away evil.'

8\. He shall not look at himself in water.

9\. A*g*âtalomnî*m* vipu*m*sî*m* sha*ndh*a*m* *k*a nopahaset.

10\. Let him call a pregnant woman 'vi*g*anyâ' (one who will give birth
to a child);

11\. An ichneumon (nakula), sakula;

12 <span id="fr_806"></span>[12](#fn_805). A skull (kapâla.md), bhagâla;

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

13 <span id="fr_807"></span>[13](#fn_806.md). A rainbow (Indra-dhanu,
Indra's bow), ma*n*idhanu (the jewelled bow).

14 <span id="fr_808"></span>[14](#fn_807). A cow that suckles (her calf.md)
he should not point out to another (person).

15 <span id="fr_809"></span>[15](#fn_808.md). Let him not void urine or
excrements on a ploughed field, on uncovered ground, or while rising up
or standing.

16\. He shall wipe himself with wood that has fallen off by itself.

17 <span id="fr_810"></span>[17](#fn_809.md). He should not wear a dyed
garment.

18\. He should be fixed in his intentions, protect everybody's life, and
be everybody's friend, as it were.
