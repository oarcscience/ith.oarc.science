*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 8.

1\. Now when returning (home from his teacher) he should get the
following things, viz. a jewel (to be tied round the neck), two
ear-rings, a pair of garments, a parasol, a pair of shoes, a staff, a
wreath, (pounded seed of the Kara*ñg*a fruit) for rubbing with,
ointment, eye salve, a turban; (all that) for himself and for the
teacher.

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

2\. If he cannot get it for both, only for the teacher.

3\. He then should get a piece of wood of a tree which is sacrificially
pure, in a north-eastern direction—

4\. Sappy (wood) if he wishes for the enjoyment of food, or for
prosperity, or for splendour; dry (wood), if for holy lustre,

5\. (Wood) which is both (sappy and dry, in its different parts), if (he
wishes) for both.

6 <span id="fr_551"></span>[6](#fn_550.md). Having put the piece of wood on
high, and having given a cow and food to the Brâhma*n*as, he should
perform the ceremony of shaving the beard.

7 <span id="fr_552"></span>[7](#fn_551.md). He should alter the texts so
that they refer to himself.

8 <span id="fr_553"></span>[8](#fn_552.md). With Ekaklîtaka (he should
perform the rubbing).

9\. Having washed himself with lukewarm water, and having put on two
(new) garments which have not yet been washed, with (the verse),
'Garments with fat splendour you put on, (Mitra and Varu*n*a)' (Rig-veda
I, 152, 1); he should anoint his eyes with (the words), 'The sharpness
of the stone art thou; protect my eye.'

10\. With (the words), 'The sharpness of the stone

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

art thou; protect my ear'—he should tie on the two ear-rings.

11\. After having salved his two hands with ointment, a Brâhma*n*a
should salve his head first,

12\. A Râ*g*anya his two arms,

13\. A Vai*s*ya the belly,

14\. A woman her secret parts,

15\. Persons who gain their livelihood by running, their thighs.

16\. With (the formula), 'Free from pain art thou, free from pain may I
become'—he should put on the wreath.

17\. Not (such a wreath) which is called mâlâ.

18\. If they call it mâlâ, he should cause them to call it sra*g*.

19\. With (the formula), 'The standing-places of the gods are you;
protect me from all sides'—he steps into the shoes, and with (the
formula), 'The heaven's covering art thou'—he takes the parasol.

20\. With (the formula), 'Reed thou art; from the tree thou descendest;
protect me from all sides'—(he takes) a staff of reed.

21 <span id="fr_554"></span>[21](#fn_553.md). Having with the hymn 'Giving
life' tied the jewel to his neck and arranged the turban (on his head),
he should standing put the piece of wood (on the fire).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_550"></span>[227:6](sbe29141.htm#fr_551.md) 8, 6. 'On high'
means 'not on the ground' (Nârâya*n*a). On the gaudânika*m* karma (the
shaving of the beard), comp. above, Adhyâya I, Ka*nd*ikâ 18. The word
'ceremony' would mean here, according to Nârâya*n*a, that he should
perform the rite alone, without observing such prescriptions as stated
above, I, 18, 7.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[227:7](sbe29141.htm#fr_552.md) Thus, instead of
'Herb! protect him!' (I, 17, 8) he is to say, 'Herb! protect me!' and so
on.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[227:8](sbe29141.htm#fr_553.md) Ekaklîtaka is,
according to Nârâya*n*a and the Prayogaratna, the seed of such a
Kara*ñg*a fruit (Pongamia Glabra, Vent.) which contains only one grain
of seed. Such grains are pounded before he rubs himself therewith.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[228:21](sbe29141.htm#fr_554.md) On the hymn
beginning with the words 'Giving life,' see Prof. Stenzler's note on
this Sûtra. Its first verse is identical with Vâ*g*asaneyi Sa*m*hitâ
XXXIV, 50 (comp. also *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya III, 1, 7), and so are most
of its verses found in that Sa*m*hitâ or in the Atharva-veda; the whole
of it occurs among the Rig-veda Khilas (vol. vi, p. 25, 2-12).
