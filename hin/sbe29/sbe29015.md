*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 13.

1\. 'Be queen with thy father-in-law,' with this verse (Rig-veda X, 85,
46) her father or brother sacrifices with a sword's point on her head,
or with the Sruva, standing while she is sitting, with his face turned
to the west, while her face is turned to the east.

2\. 'I seize thy hand for the sake of happiness' (Rig-veda X, 85, 36),
with these words (the bridegroom) seizes with his right hand her right
hand with the thumb, both hands being turned with the palms upwards, he
standing while she is sitting, with his face turned to the west, while
her face is turned to the east.

3\. And when he has murmured the following five verses,

4 <span id="fr_78"></span>[4](#fn_77). (He continues thus,.md) 'This am I,
that art thou;

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

that art thou, this am I; the heaven I, the earth thou; the *Rik* art
thou, the Sâman I. So be thou devoted to me.

'Well! Let us here marry. Let us beget offspring. Let us acquire many
sons who may reach old age.'

5\. (The Â*k*ârya) fills, with the words bhûr bhuva*h* sva*h*, a new
water-pot,

6 <span id="fr_79"></span>[6](#fn_78). Throws into it (branches.md) with
milky sap and leaves, of a tree the name of which is masculine, together
with Ku*s*a grass,

7\. And gold, according to some (teachers),

8\. And hands it over to a student who observes silence.

9 <span id="fr_80"></span>[9](#fn_79.md). They should walk round this
Stheyâ water, (placed) to the north-east, so that they turn their right
sides . towards it.

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

10\. And after (the Â*k*ârya) has placed a stone towards the northern
direction,

11\. (The bridegroom) makes her rise with the words, 'Come, thou joyful
one,'

12\. And makes her tread with the tip of her right foot on the stone,
with the words, 'Come, tread on the stone; like a stone be firm. Tread
the foes down; overcome the enemies.'

13\. He then leads her round the fire so that their right sides are
turned to it,

14\. And gives her a second garment with the same text (chap. 12, § 3).

15\. Her father or brother pours out of a basket fried grain mixed with
*S*amî leaves into her joined hands.

16\. The spreading under, the sprinkling over, and the second sprinkling
over (are done) with Â*g*ya.

17 <span id="fr_81"></span>[17](#fn_80.md). She sacrifices those (fried
grains).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_77"></span>[35:4](sbe29015.htm#fr_78.md) 13, 4. Nârâya*n*a
states that here four Brâhma*n*as should repeat <span id="page_36">p.
36</span> the Sûryâ hymn (Rig-veda X, 85) to the bride. That, according
to *S*âṅkhâyana, that hymn is recited at the wedding, is clear from
chap. 14, 12.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[36:6](sbe29015.htm#fr_79.md) Sakshîrânt
sapalâ*s*ânt saku*s*ân. Nârâya*n*a's commentary divides sa ku*s*ân, and
refers sa to the â*k*ârya. But this sa would be superfluous, and the
substantive to which sakshîrân and sapalâ*s*ân are to be referred, is,
as both the nature of the case and the corresponding passages show,
*s*âkhân and not ku*s*ân. Comp. the *S*rauta-sûtra IV, 17, 5:
palâsa*s*âkhâ*m* sapalâ*s*â*m* nikhâya, and a passage concerning the
very rite here described, Â*s*valâyana-pari*s*ish*t*a I, 24:
audumbaryârddhayâ. (read, ârdrayâ?) *s*âkhayâ sapalâ*s*ayâ
sahira*n*yapavitrayâ sadûrvâpavitrayâ. The MS. of the *S*âmbavya-sûtra
has sakshîrân palâ*s*ân saku*s*ân.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[36:9](sbe29015.htm#fr_80.md) 'The Stheyâ water has
to be so placed that when the bride and the bridegroom walk (their seven
steps, see chap. 14, 5 seq.), their right sides are turned towards it.'
Nârâya*n*a. Comp., regarding the Stheyâ water and its bearer, the
G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha-pari*s*ish*t*a II, 26. 30. 35.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[37:17](sbe29015.htm#fr_81.md) I believe that the
words forming this Sûtra, tâ*ñ* *g*uhoti, are taken from the same lost
old G*ri*hya text which *S*âṅkhâyana has followed word for word also in
I, 5, 1-5 and elsewhere. This is made probable by the comparison of
Pâraskara I, 6, 2. The author of our text, while literally adopting the
words of his original, has not quite succeeded in welding them together
with his own statements; thus the sacrifice of grains is treated of in
this Sûtra and in the first Sûtra of the next chapter, as if there were
two different acts, while indeed it is one and the same.
