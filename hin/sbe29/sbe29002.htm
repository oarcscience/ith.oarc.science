<p>THE G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra ascribed to <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana, which has been edited and translated into German by myself in the XVth volume of the Indische Studien, is based on the first of the four Vedas, the Rig-veda in the B&acirc;shkala recension&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_0"></A><A HREF="#fn_0"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and among the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts, on the Kaush&icirc;taka. Its reputed author, whom we ordinarily find called by his family name, <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana, had the proper name Suya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a. This we may infer from the lists of Vedic teachers given in different G<I>ri</I>hya texts where they describe the Tarpa<I>n</I>a ceremony. Though in these lists the order of names varies very much, yet the two names Suya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a and <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana are constantly placed side by side, so that this fact alone would render it probable that they belonged to the same person. Thus we read in the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya IV, 10 = VI, 1:</p>  
<p>Kahola<I>m</I> Kaush&icirc;taki<I>m</I>, Mah&acirc;kaush&icirc;taki<I>m</I>, Suya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a<I>m</I> <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yanam, &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yanam, Aitareyam, Mahaitareyam.</p>  
<p>Here we have grouped together the two Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a authors (with the fictitious doubles, the great Kaush&icirc;taki, the great Aitareya) and the two corresponding S&ucirc;tra authors belonging to the two chief branches of the Rig-veda literature; first comes one Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a author (for Kahola Kaush&icirc;taki is one person) with the S&ucirc;tra author connected with him, then the second S&ucirc;tra author and the corresponding Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a teacher.</p>  
<p>In the <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya-G<I>ri</I>hya (Indische Studien, XV, 154) the corresponding passage runs thus:</p>  
<p>G&acirc;rgya- Gautama- <I>S</I>&acirc;kalya- B&acirc;bhravya- M&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>attavya</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_4"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 4</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> [sic]- M&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>&ucirc;key&acirc;<I>h</I> Suya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a- S&acirc;<I>m</I>khy&acirc;yana- <I>G</I>&acirc;tukar<I>n</I>yey&acirc;<I>h</I> [sic] Pai<I>m</I>ga [sic]- <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavy&#146;-Aitarey&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The same G<I>ri</I>hya still more explicitly bears witness to the name of Suya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana, by adding at the end of the list, from which these names are quoted the following words: Suya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;yanas [sic] t<I>ri</I>[pya]tu, i.e. 'May Suya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana satiate himself (with the water offering).'</p>  
<p>In the &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya III, 4, we read:</p>  
<p>Kahola<I>m</I> Kaush&icirc;taka<I>m</I> Mah&acirc;kaush&icirc;taka<I>m</I> Pai&#7749;gya<I>m</I> Mah&acirc;pai&#7749;gya<I>m</I> Suya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a<I>m</I> <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yanam Aitareyam Mahaitareyam.</p>  
<p>We may also quote here a K&acirc;rik&acirc; given by N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#fn_1"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in his great commentary on the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya (I, 1, 10):</p>  
<p>Atr&acirc;ra<I>n</I>iprad&acirc;na<I>m</I> yad adhvaryu<I>h</I> kurute kva<I>k</I>it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#fn_2"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> mata<I>m</I> tan na Suya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>asya, mathita<I>m</I> so &#146;tra ne<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ati.</p>  
<p>It would perhaps be hazardous to claim for the author of this K&acirc;rik&acirc; the authority of an independent witness, for very likely he may have derived his knowledge from the lists of teachers which we have quoted before. But at all events the concordance of the three G<I>ri</I>hya texts furnishes a proof which, I think, cannot be set aside by another testimony which we must mention now. At the end of the Kaush&icirc;taki-&Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka (Adhy&acirc;ya 15) we find a Va<I>m</I><I>s</I>a or list of the teachers by whom the knowledge contained in that &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka is supposed to have been handed down. The opening words of this list run thus:</p>  
<p>'Om! Now follows the Va<I>m</I><I>s</I>a. Adoration to the Brahman! Adoration to the teachers! We have learnt (this text) from Gu<I>n</I>&acirc;khya <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana, Gu<I>n</I>&acirc;khya <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana from Kahola Kaush&icirc;taki, Kahola Kaush&icirc;taki from Udd&acirc;laka &Acirc;ru<I>n</I>i, &amp;c:</p>  
<p>It is a very natural supposition that the author of this list intended to begin with the name of the Doctor eponymus, if we may say so, of the S&ucirc;tras of his school, and then to proceed to name the Doctor eponymus of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, and after him the more ancient teachers and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>sages. But whether the author of this passage really supposed this Gu<I>n</I>&acirc;khya <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana to be the author of the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-s&ucirc;tras, or not, we shall be justified in following rather the unanimous statements of the texts previously quoted, and in accepting in accordance with them, as the full name of our S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra, the name Suya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana.</p>  
<p>The G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra which has been here translated presupposes, as all G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras do, the existence of the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra, with which it is intimately connected and which is referred to in the G<I>ri</I>hya in several instances&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#fn_3"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Here the question arises whether the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra was composed by the same author to whom the authorship of the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra belongs, so that the two texts form together, and would, in the conception of their author, be intended to form, one great body of S&ucirc;tras, or, on the other hand, whether the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra is a later addition to the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra. On this question I have ventured, in the preface to my German edition of <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, to offer a few remarks which, however, I feel bound to say do not seem to myself quite decisive. I there pointed out that the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra contains a few aphorisms which we should rather expect would have found their place in the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra, if the two texts were composed by the same author and on a common plan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. But, apart from the possibility that in a work of such considerable extent as that collection of S&ucirc;tras would be, such trifling incongruences or irregularities might very easily escape the attention even of a very careful author, there is still another objection that may be urged against the inference drawn by me from such passages. It can be shown&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> that the G<I>ri</I>hya texts which we possess are based to some extent on one common original, from which they have taken verbatim, or nearly verbatim, a certain number of aphorisms. Thus if we were to suppose that <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana,</p>  
<p>
</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>or whosoever the author of this G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra may have been, found the aphorisms on which I once based my argument, in that original text, this would explain the occurrence of those passages in a portion of the great body of S&ucirc;tras different from that in which we should expect to meet them. Now several of the passages in question recur identically in other G<I>ri</I>hya texts, so that we may infer indeed that they are taken from that lost original, and we have no means to judge whether the other similar passages are not taken from it also. I believe, therefore, that the opinion which I once pronounced regarding the relation in which the two S&ucirc;tra texts stand to each other, cannot be vindicated, and that it is better to leave that question unanswered until perhaps further discoveries throw a new light on it.</p>  
<p>For the reconstruction of the correct text of the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya, and occasionally also for its interpretation, it is of considerable importance that we possess, besides the Devan&acirc;gar&icirc; MSS. of the text and of the commentaries, a South Indian MS. written in the Grantha character (MS. Whish 78 in the library of the Royal Asiatic Society, London) which contains a G<I>ri</I>hya based on that of <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana and following it, during the greater part of the work, nearly word for word&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It is designated in the MS., at the end of the single Adhy&acirc;yas, as 'Kaush&icirc;taka-G<I>ri</I>hya.' It therefore professes to follow the teaching of the same Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a which is adhered to also by the S&ucirc;tra school of <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana. A metrical commentary, which in the MS. follows after the text, names in its opening <I>S</I>loka a teacher <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya as the author of this S&ucirc;tra. The <I>S</I>loka runs thus:</p>  
<p>Natv&acirc; Kaush&icirc;tak&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya<I>m</I> <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya<I>m</I> s&ucirc;trak<I>ri</I>ttamam<br> g<I>ri</I>hya<I>m</I> tad&icirc;ya<I>m</I> sa<I>m</I>kshipya vy&acirc;khy&acirc;sye bahuvism<I>ri</I>tam.</p>  
<p>('Having bowed to the most excellent author of S&ucirc;tras, to <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya, the &Acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya belonging to the Kaush&icirc;taka school, I shall compose a short commentary on his G<I>ri</I>hya, which has been forgotten by many.')</p>  
<p>The name of this <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya does not occur among the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>teachers enumerated in the description of the Tarpa<I>n</I>a ceremony, neither in <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana IV, 10, nor in &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana III, 4; but in the list of the <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya-G<I>ri</I>hya itself it is found (see above, p. 4); and besides it seems to me also to be mentioned in &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya IV, 8, 24, in which passage it will scarcely be considered too bold to conjecture <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya instead of <I>S</I>&acirc;<I>m</I>vatya.</p>  
<p>Though the MS. of the <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya-G<I>ri</I>hya is very confused, and full of blunders of all sorts, yet it deserves to be attentively studied by all scholars who are accustomed to look, if not in theory yet in practice, on the agreement of a few Vedic text MSS., or of a few Indian commentaries, as if it had a claim to an unassailable authority to which European Orientalists would have no right to deny their faith. In the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya a number of passages are found in which corrupt readings or perverse explanations are supported by all the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana MSS. and by all the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana commentaries, and if, by a rare and fortunate chance, the <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya Grantha MS., which is unaffected by the blunders of the Devan&acirc;gar&icirc; MSS., had not been discovered in the south of the peninsula, these readings and explanations would seem to rest on the unanimous agreement of tradition. Perhaps it seems unnecessary to dwell on this point, for very few Orientalists, if any, would be prepared to assert that Indian tradition is infallible. But when looking over many of the editions and translations of the Vedic texts; even such as have been published in the last years, one finds plentiful occasion to observe that in hundreds of passages tradition has been practically treated, by scholars of very high merit, as if it had an authority not very far removed from infallibility. A case like that of which we have to speak here, in which a whole set of MSS., and occasionally also of commentaries, can be tested by a MS. of a nearly related text, written in a different character and in a distant part of India, will strengthen our belief that we are right in judging for ourselves, even if that judgment should oppose itself to such authorities as N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a or R&acirc;ma<I>k</I>andra or <I>G</I>ayar&acirc;ma.</p>  
<p>Perhaps it will not be out of place to add here, as an</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_8"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>illustration of these remarks, a few observations on one of the passages in which the rejection of the traditional <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana reading, together with the traditional <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana explanation, is confirmed by the <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya MS., though no doubt, even without the aid of that MS., we ought to have formed the right conclusions for ourselves. At <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana II, 4, 1. 2 the traditional reading is:</p>  
<p>Mama vrate h<I>ri</I>daya<I>m</I> te dadh&acirc;mi mama <I>k</I>ittam anu <I>k</I>itta<I>m</I> to astu | mama v&acirc;<I>k</I>am ekaman&acirc; <I>g</I>ushasva B<I>ri</I>haspatish <I>t</I>v&acirc; niyunaktu mahyam iti | k&acirc;masya brahma<I>k</I>aryasy&acirc;s&acirc;v iti.</p>  
<p><I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana is treating here of the Upanayana, or the initiation of the student who is received by a teacher and intends to study the Veda with him. The teacher on that occasion is to pronounce the Mantra which we have just transcribed, and which translated into English would run thus:</p>  
<p>'Under my will I take thy heart; after my mind shall thy mind follow; in my word thou shalt rejoice with all thy heart; may B<I>ri</I>haspati join thee to me.' 'Of the Brahma<I>k</I>arya of K&acirc;ma (or lust), N.N.!'</p>  
<p>The MSS. give the end of the passage as we have printed it above, k&acirc;masya brahma<I>k</I>aryasy&acirc;s&acirc;v iti. This N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a explains in the following way. Brahma<I>k</I>arya here means the observances which the student has to keep through certain periods of time before the different texts which he has to learn can be taught him. First comes the S&acirc;vitr&icirc; verse, for which he prepares himself by observing the s&acirc;vitra vrata; this lasts either one year, or three days, or the S&acirc;vitr&icirc; can also be taught him immediately (see chap. 5, 1-3). Then follows the <I>s</I>ukriya vrata, of three days, or twelve days, or one year, or any other period of time according to the teacher's pleasure (chap. 11, 10); by this vrata the student is enabled to study the main portion of the Veda. Finally come the <I>s</I>&acirc;kvara, vr&acirc;tika, aupanishada observances, each of which has to last one year, and which refer to the different parts of the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka (see chap. 11, 11 seq., and the sixth book). Now the formula of which we treat here refers principally to the s&acirc;vitra</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>vrata. The teacher announces to the student how long he has to keep that vrata. He says (S&ucirc;tra 1), 'May B<I>ri</I>haspati join thee to me (S&ucirc;tra 2) for a brahma<I>k</I>arya (i.e. a vrata) of such and such (k&acirc;masya) a time (one year, three days, &amp;c.); N.N.!' K&acirc;ma (the pleasure) would thus stand here as an expletive which was to be replaced in each single case by the indication of the real space of time that depended on the teacher's pleasure ('. . . niyunaktu mahya<I>m</I> s&acirc;<I>m</I>vatsarikasya trair&acirc;trikasya v&acirc;nvakshikasya v&acirc; s&acirc;vitrasya brahma<I>k</I>aryasy&acirc;muk&acirc;muka<I>s</I>armann iti v&acirc;kyasa<I>m</I>yogo <I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>eya<I>h</I>'). The same should take place at the corresponding forms of Upanayana which had to precede the entrance of the student upon the <I>s</I>ukriya, <I>s</I>&acirc;kvara, &amp;c. observances. This is the explanation of N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, with which R&acirc;ma<I>k</I>andra and all the other commentaries agree. It will scarcely be necessary to observe that the singular use of k &acirc; ma, on which this traditional explanation rests, is neither in accordance with the meaning of the word, nor supported by any parallel texts. So, even before I had the opportunity of collating the <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya MS., I had no doubt that the system of the Vratas has nothing at all to do with our S&ucirc;tra, and that its text should be made intelligible by a slight alteration touching only the quantity of the a in two syllables, by writing, K&acirc;masya brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;ry asy as&acirc;v iti (thou art the Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin of K&acirc;ma, N.N.!), as we read in &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana I, 20, 8, kasya brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;ryasi, pr&acirc;<I>n</I>asya brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;ry asi. Afterwards I found that the Grantha MS. of <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya gives the very reading which I had conjectured.</p>  
<p>Passages like this are not very rare in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras. In the other S&ucirc;tras we are not in the same favourable position of possessing a MS. which enables us, as the Grantha MS. of <I>S</I>&acirc;mbavya does, to test their text.</p>  
<p>We cannot conclude these introductory remarks without speaking of the later additions tacked on at the end of the original body of the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. There are unmistakable indications that the fifth and sixth books are later additions. The fifth book is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_10"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>designated as a pari<I>s</I>ish<I>t</I>a in a K&acirc;rik&acirc; quoted by N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a:</p>  
<p><DIR>pari<I>s</I>ish<I>t</I>&acirc;d &acirc;vasathye p&acirc;rva<I>n</I>&acirc;tikrame <I>k</I>aru<I>h</I><br> Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nar&acirc;y&acirc;gnaye <I>k</I>&acirc;gnaye&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> tantumate tath&acirc;.</DIR></p>  
<p>('According to the Pari<I>s</I>ish<I>t</I>a, if one of the half-monthly sacrifices has been omitted, a mess of rice should be offered on the sacred domestic fire to Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara and to Agni Tantumat.')</p>  
<p>The passages of the Pari<I>s</I>ish<I>t</I>a here referred to are the two first aphorisms of V, 4:</p>  
<p>'Now if a half-monthly sacrifice has not been performed, one or the other of them, then a mess of rice (is to be offered)&#151;</p>  
<p>'With (the words), "To Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara sv&acirc;h&acirc;! To Agni Tantumat sv&acirc;h&acirc;!'"</p>  
<p>There are, besides, several passages in which N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a himself mentions the fifth book under the designation of Pari<I>s</I>esh&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. And even if we had not the authority of the K&acirc;rik&acirc; and of N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, the contents alone of the fifth book would raise our suspicion against its genuineness. The matter ordinarily treated of in the G<I>ri</I>hya texts is brought to an end in Adhy&acirc;yas I-IV; in the fifth book we find diverse supplementary additions on points discussed before; rules, which no doubt would have been given at their proper place, had the fifth book been composed at the same time, and by the same author, as the preceding books&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Besides, we find different pr&acirc;ya<I>s</I><I>k</I>itta oblations treated of, and a description of two ceremonies which are mentioned, as far as I know, in no other G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra, but belong to the rites frequently described in such works as Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as, Pari<I>s</I>ish<I>t</I>as, and later Dharma texts: the consecration of ponds or wells (chap. 2), and the consecration of gardens (chap. 3).</p>  
<p>There can thus be little doubt as to the secondary character of the fifth book. And this alone suffices to</p>

<p>furnish an important argument in favour of the same view with regard to the sixth book also. This view is furthermore supported by the opening invocation in that book, addressed to Brahman and to a number of mythological beings and Vedic sages and teachers. It is evident that by such an invocation this book is characterised as a separate treatise, presupposing of course the main body of the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-s&ucirc;tras, but not forming part of it in the same sense in which, for instance, the second or the third Adhy&acirc;ya does. The object of that treatise is the exposition of the ritual connected with the study of the Rahasya texts. The sixth book, composed no doubt by a later adherent of the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana school, returns, in fact, to, and enlarges on, matters that have already found their proper place in the original G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra at II, 12, and partly also at IV, 7.</p>
