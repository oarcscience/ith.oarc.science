*The Grihya Sutras, Part 1 (SBE29)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KHA*ND*A 7.

1\. When he then returns from his journey, he looks at his house (and
says),

2 <span id="fr_214"></span>[2](#fn_213). 'House, do not fear, do not
tremble; bringing strength we come back. Bringing strength, joyful and
wise, I come back to thee, to the house, rejoicing in my mind.

'That of which the traveller thinks, that in which dwells much joy, that
I call the house. May it know us as we know it.

'Hither are called the cows; hither are called goats and sheep; and the
sweet essence (?) of food is called hither to our house.'

3\. Having approached the (sacred) domestic fire with the verse, 'This
Agni is glorious to us, this is highly glorious. Worshipping him (?) may
we suffer no harm; may he bring us to supremity'—

4\. Let him pronounce auspicious words.

5 <span id="fr_215"></span>[5](#fn_214). When accepting the water for
washing the feet he says, 'The milk of Virâ*g* art thou; may I obtain

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

the milk of Virâ*g*; in me (may) the milk of Padyâ Virâ*g* (dwell)!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_213"></span>[97:2](sbe29055.htm#fr_214) 7, 2. On kîlâla,
see chap. 3, 1.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[97:5](sbe29055.htm#fr_215) Padyâ virâ*g* is
the Virâ*g* metre, so far as it consists of <span id="page_98">p.
98</span> Pâdas; in this connection, of course, the phrase is intended
besides to convey the meaning of 'the splendour which dwells in the
feet.' Comp. Pâraskara I, 3, 12 and Professor Stenzler's note there. My
German translation of this Sûtra of *S*âṅkhâyana rests on a
misunderstanding.
