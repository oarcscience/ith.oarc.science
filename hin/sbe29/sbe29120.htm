<p>1. Some (do this) with a Mantra: 'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood, to the great <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas. Through that piece of wood increase thou, O Agni; through the Brahman (may) we (increase). Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!'</p>  
<p>2. Having put the fuel (on the fire) and having</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_190"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 190</FONT></A></p>  
<p>touched the fire, he three times wipes off his face with (the words), 'With splendour I anoint myself.'</p>  
<p>3. 'For with splendour does he anoint himself'&#151;this is understood (in the <I>S</I>ruti).</p>  
<p>4. 'On me may Agni bestow insight, on me offspring, on me splendour.</p>  
<p>'On me may Indra bestow insight, on me offspring, on me strength (indriya).</p>  
<p>'On me may S&ucirc;rya bestow insight, on me offspring, on me radiance.</p>  
<p>'What thy splendour is, Agni, may I thereby become resplendent.</p>  
<p>'What thy vigour is, Agni, may I thereby become vigorous.</p>  
<p>'What thy consuming power is, Agni, may I thereby obtain consuming power'&#151;with (these formulas) he should approach the fire, bend his knee, embrace (the teacher's feet), and say to him, 'Recite, sir! The S&acirc;vitr&icirc;, sir, recite!'</p>  
<p>5. Seizing with his (i.e. the student's) garment and with (his own) hands (the student's) hands (the teacher) recites the S&acirc;vitr&icirc;, (firstly) P&acirc;da by P&acirc;da, (then) hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) the whole (verse).</p>  
<p>6. He should make him recite (the S&acirc;vitr&icirc;) as far as he is able.</p>  
<p>7. On the place of his (i.e. the student's) heart (the teacher) lays his hand with the fingers upwards, with (the formula), 'Into my will I take thy heart; after my mind shall thy mind follow; in my word thou shalt rejoice with all thy will; may B<I>ri</I>haspati join thee to me.'</p>
