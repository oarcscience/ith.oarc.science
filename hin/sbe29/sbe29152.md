------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KA*ND*IKÂ 7.

1 <span id="fr_623"></span>[1](#fn_622.md). Now at a *S*râddha ceremony, at
that which is celebrated on the Parvan day, or for the attainment of
special wishes, or at the Âbhyudayika *S*râddha (i.e. the *S*râddha
celebrated when some good luck has happened), or at the Ekoddish*t*a
*S*râddha (the *S*râddha directed to a single dead person)—

2\. He causes Brâhma*n*as who are endowed with learning, moral
character, and correct conduct, or with one of these (characteristics),
who have been invited in time, who have taken a bath, washed their feet,
and sipped water, to sit down, as representatives of the Fathers, with
their faces turned to the north, one for each one of the Fathers, or two
for each, or three for each.

3\. The larger their number is, the greater is the reward (which the
sacrificer is entitled to expect).

4\. But in no case one (Brâhma*n*a) for all (the fathers).

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

5 <span id="fr_624"></span>[5](#fn_623.md). Optionally (he may invite only
one Brâhma*n*a) except at the first (*S*râddha).

6 <span id="fr_625"></span>[6](#fn_624). By (the exposition of.md) the
Pi*nd*a sacrifice (the corresponding rules) have been declared (for the
*S*râddha ceremonies also).

7\. Having given water (to the Brâhma*n*as),

8 <span id="fr_626"></span>[8](#fn_625.md). Having given to them
double-folded Darbha blades, and a seat,

9 <span id="fr_627"></span>[9](#fn_626). Having (again.md) given water (to
them),

10\. Having poured water into three vessels of metal, of stone, and of
earthen-ware, or (into three vessels) made of the same substance, over
which he has put Darbha grass,

And having recited over (that water the verse), 'For luck and help the
divine waters' (Rig-veda X, 9, 4), he pours sesamum seeds into it with
(the formula), 'Sesamum art thou; Soma is thy deity; at the Gosava
sacrifice thou hast been created by

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

the gods. By the ancients thou hast been offered. Through the funeral
oblation render the Fathers and these worlds propitious to us. Svadhâ!
Adoration!'

12 <span id="fr_628"></span>[12](#fn_627.md). (The different rites are
performed) from the right to the left.

13 <span id="fr_629"></span>[13](#fn_628). With (the part.md) of the other
(i.e. left) hand between the thumb (and the fore-finger), because he
wears the sacrificial cord over *h*is left shoulder, or with the right
hand which he seizes with the left (he offers the Arghya water to the
Fathers with the words), 'Father, this is thy Arghya. Grandfather, this
is thy Arghya. Great-grandfather, this is thy Arghya'—having first
offered (ordinary) water (to the Fathers).

14\. When he is going to hand over that (Arghya water to the Brâhma*n*as
who represent the Fathers, he says once each time), 'Svadhâ! The Arghya
water!'

15 <span id="fr_630"></span>[15](#fn_629). Over (the Arghya water.md) which
has been

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

poured out, he should recite the verse, 'The celestial waters which have
been produced on the earth, the aerial waters and the waters which are
terrestrial, the gold-coloured ones, apt for sacrifice, may these waters
bring us luck and be kind to us.' Pouring together what has been left
(in the three Arghya vessels) he moistens his face with that water, if
he desires that a son should be born to him.

16 <span id="fr_631"></span>[16](#fn_630.md). 'He should not take up the
first vessel, into which the Arghya water for the Fathers has been
poured. Hidden the Fathers dwell therein: thus *S*aunaka has said.'

17 <span id="fr_632"></span>[17](#fn_631.md). In that moment the gifts of
perfumes, garlands, incense, lights, and clothes are offered (to the
Brâhma*n*as).

18\. Having taken some food (of the Sthâlîpâka prepared for the
Pi*nd*apit*ri*ya*gñ*a), and having besmeared it with ghee, he asks (the
Brâhma*n*as) for their permission by saying, 'I shall offer it in the
fire,' or, 'I will sacrifice my offering in the fire,' or, 'I will offer
it in the fire.'

19\. The permission (is given in the words), 'It may be offered,' or,
'Sacrifice thy offering,' or, Offer it.'

20 <span id="fr_633"></span>[20](#fn_632.md). He then sacrifices in the
fire as stated above,

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

21 <span id="fr_634"></span>[21](#fn_633.md). Or, if they give their
permission, in the hands (of the Brâhma*n*as).

22\. 'The mouth of the gods verily is the fire, the mouth of the Fathers
is the hand'—thus says the Brâhma*n*a.

23\. If in the hands, he assigns to them other food, after they have
sipped water.

24 <span id="fr_635"></span>[24](#fn_634). The food (is put together.md)
with the food.

25 <span id="fr_636"></span>[25](#fn_635.md). It is said, 'What is given
away and offered, that brings prosperity.'

26 <span id="fr_637"></span>[26](#fn_636.md). When he sees that they are
satiated, he should recite (the verses) containing the word m a dh u,
and (the verse), 'They have eaten, they have enjoyed themselves'
(Rig-veda I, 82, 2).

27 <span id="fr_638"></span>[27](#fn_637.md). Having asked them,
'Relished?' and having taken the food, whatever food he has used,
together with the Sthâlîpâka, in order to make lumps thereof, he should
offer the rest (to the Brâhma*n*as).

28\. After they have either accepted (that rest of food), or left it (to
him), and have finished eating, he should, before they have sipped
water, put down the lumps for the Fathers.

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

29\. After they have sipped water, according to some (teachers).

30 <span id="fr_639"></span>[30](#fn_638.md). Having strewn the food on the
ground and suspended the sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, he
should dismiss the Brâhma*n*as, (saying to them), 'Say Om! Svadhâ!'

31\. Or, 'So be it! Svadhâ!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_622"></span>[250:1](sbe29152.htm#fr_623.md) 7, 1. Comp. on the
*S*râddha ceremonies in general the note on *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya IV, 1,
1, and the quotations given there. The Pârva*n*a *S*râddha, which is
celebrated on the new-moon day, is treated of by *S*âṅkhâyana IV, 1, the
Âbhyudayika *S*râddha, IV, 4, the Ekoddish*t*a *S*râddha, IV, 2.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[251:5](sbe29152.htm#fr_624.md) Anâdye. Of the
different interpretations of this word which Nârâya*n*a gives, it may
suffice here to quote two. The first *S*râddha may either mean the
Pârva*n*a *S*râddha, because this stands first among the different kinds
of *S*râddha ceremonies enumerated in Sûtra 1; or it may mean the
Sapi*nd*îkara*n*a (see Sâṅkhâyana IV, 3), for this is the first occasion
on which a dead person receives *S*râddha oblations together with two
others of the Fathers.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[251:6](sbe29152.htm#fr_625.md) The sacrifice to
the Manes, as forming part of the *S*rauta ritual, is explained in the
*S*rauta-sûtra II, 6 seq.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[251:8](sbe29152.htm#fr_626.md) Yâ*gñ*avalkya I,
229.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[251:9](sbe29152.htm#fr_627.md) Yâ*gñ*avalkya I,
230. The reading of several words of the Mantra is doubtful, and the
parallel texts, as Prof. Stenzler has not failed to observe, differ;
especially the words pratnavadbhi*h* pratta*h* seem to me to be corrupt.
The word pratnavat is only known to the Petersburg Dictionary as having
the meaning, 'containing the word pratna,' which will not do here. Thus,
I think that the reading pratnam adbhi*h* p*ri*kta*h* should be adopted;
the translation would be, 'Anciently thou hast been mixed with water.'

<span id="fn_627"></span>[252:12](sbe29152.htm#fr_628.md) Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya IV, 4, 6.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[252:13](sbe29152.htm#fr_629.md) The part of the
hand above the thumb is called the 'Tîrtha belonging to the Manes;' see,
for instance, Baudhâyana's Dharma-sûtra I, 8, 16. The sacrificer is here
understood to wear his sacrificial cord suspended over the left shoulder
(he is 'yâ*gñ*opavîtin'). But as the oblation here treated of is
directed to the Manes, it is required that he should be prâ*k*înâvîtin.
Now he is considered as prâ*k*înâvîtin, according to Nârâya*n*a, not
only if the cord is suspended over his right shoulder (which is the
ordinary meaning of prâ*k*înâvîtin), but also if the hand with which he
performs the rites, and the shoulder over which he wears the sacred
cord, are either both right or both left. Thus here, acting with the
left-hand and wearing the cord over the left shoulder, he becomes
prâ*k*înâvîtin.

The last word (appûrvam) is separated by Nârâya*n*a from the rest, so
that it forms a separate Sûtra.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[252:15](sbe29152.htm#fr_630.md) The sacrificer
gives the water to the Brâhma*n*as, and these <span id="page_253">p.
253</span> pour it out. Instead of p*ri*thivî sambabhûvu*h* (p*ri*thivî
being intended as a locative; see Lanman, Noun-inflection in the Veda,
p. 389) we should read, no doubt, as the parallel texts have, payasâ
sambabhûvu*h*: 'The celestial waters which have united themselves with
milk.'

<span id="fn_630"></span>[253:16](sbe29152.htm#fr_631.md) This is a
*S*loka.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[253:17](sbe29152.htm#fr_632.md) Manu III, 209;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 231.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[253:20](sbe29152.htm#fr_633.md) The oblations
alluded to in this Sûtra are prescribed in the *S*rauta-sûtra, II, 6,
12. They are directed to Soma pit*ri*mat and to Agni kavyavâhana.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[254:21](sbe29152.htm#fr_634.md) According to Manu
(III, 212) this is done only in case there is no fire. Possibly
abhyanu*gñ*âyâm belongs to Sûtra 20, so that we should have to
translate, 'He then sacrifices . . . if they give their permission. Or
in the hands.'

<span id="fn_634"></span>[254:24](sbe29152.htm#fr_635.md) 'The food which
is left from the oblations he puts with the food (Sûtra 23) which is to
be eaten by the Brâhma*n*as, and has been put into the vessels.'
Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[254:25](sbe29152.htm#fr_636.md) Is s*ri*sh*t*am
to be understood in the sense of vis*ri*sh*t*am? Nârâya*n*a explains it
by prabhûtam.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[254:26](sbe29152.htm#fr_637.md) The verses
containing the word madhu are Rig-veda I, 90, 6-8.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[254:27](sbe29152.htm#fr_638.md) On the question,
'Relished?' compare *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya IV, 2, 5. For several kinds of
*S*râddha ceremonies a Sthâlîpâka is prescribed, for others it is not;
for the *S*râddhas of the last kind the words 'Together with the
Sthâlîpâka' are not valid.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[255:30](sbe29152.htm#fr_639.md) They reply, 'Om!
Svadhâ!'
