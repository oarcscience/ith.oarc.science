2\. The teacher sitting to the east or to the north, the other one to
the south, with his face turned to the north.

3\. Or two (students shall be so seated).

4\. But more (than two) as there is room (for them).

5\. He should not sit on a high seat in presence of a Guru,

6\. Nor on the same seat (with him),

7\. Nor with outstretched feet,

8\. Nor stretching his arms under his knees,

9\. Nor leaning his body (against a support), to. Nor forming with his
feet a lap,

11 <span id="fr_272"></span>[11](#fn_271). Nor holding his feet like an
axe.

12 <span id="fr_273"></span>[12](#fn_272). After (the student) has said,
Recite, sir!' the teacher shall cause him to pronounce the syllable OM.

13\. 'OM,' replies the other.

14\. Thereafter let him recite uninterruptedly.

15\. When he has recited, he embraces (his teacher's feet),

16\. Says, 'We have finished, sir!' and (goes away) according to his
business.

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

17\. (He shall say,) 'Leave! Pause meanwhile!' according to some
(teachers).

18\. Let no one step between (a teacher and students) who study.

19 <span id="fr_274"></span>[19](#fn_273). Let no one change his place
during the recitation.

20\. Should any fault be committed, let him fast three days, or one day
and one night, repeat the Sâvitrî as long as he can, and give something
to the Brâhma*n*as; then after an interruption of one day and one night
the study should go on.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[119:12](sbe29070.htm#fr_273) The words adhîhi
bho (recite, sir!) are pronounced by the student; this follows from the
passages quoted in the note on 1I, 5, 10. Nârâya*n*a states that those
words are pronounced by the teacher (â*k*âryo guru*h* *s*ishyam
adhyâpanârtham adhîhi bho 3 iti *s*abdam uktvâ . . .).

<span id="fn_273"></span>[120:19](sbe29070.htm#fr_274) The translation
of âtmâna*m* vipariharet is conjectural; comp. also Nârâya*n*a's note,
p. 151 of the German edition.
