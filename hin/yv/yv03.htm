</I><H3>iii. 1. 1.</H3>
<P>Prajapati desired, 'May I create offspring.' He did penance, he created serpents. He desired, 'May I create offspring.' He did penance a second time, he created birds. He desired, 'May I create offspring.' He did penance a third time, he saw this speech of the consecrated, he spoke it. Then indeed did he create offspring. In that after undergoing penance he speaks the speech of the consecrated, the sacrificer thus [1] creates offspring. If one who is consecrated sees anything impure, the consecration departs from him; his dark colour, his beauty goes away. 'Mind unbound; eye weak; sun best of lights; O consecration, forsake me not', he says, and consecration departs not from him, his dark colour and his beauty go not away. If rain falls on one who is consecrated, the heavenly waters if unappeased destroy his force, might, consecration [2], and penance. 'Do ye flowing waters place might (in me), place force, place might; do not destroy my consecration, nor my penance', he says; verily he places all that in himself; they do not destroy his force, might, consecration, or penance. Agni is the divinity of the consecrated man, and he is concealed as it were from him, when he goes (out), and the Raksases are able to hurt him [3]. 'From good to better do thou advance; may Brhaspati be thy forerunner', he says. Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily he grasps hold of him, and he brings him safely through. 'Here we have come (<I>a-idam</I>) to the place on earth for sacrifice to the gods', he says, for he comes to the place on earth for sacrifice, who sacrifices. 'Wherein aforetime all the gods rejoiced', he says, for all the gods delight in it, in that the Brahmans so do. 'Accomplishing (the rite) with Rc, Saman, and Yajus', he says, for he who sacrifices accomplishes (the rite) with Rc, Saman, and Yajus. 'Let us rejoice in fullness of wealth, in sustenance', he says; verily he invokes this blessing.</P>
<H3>iii. 1. 2.</H3>
<P>'This is thy Gayatri part', say for me to Soma.<BR>
'This is thy Tristubh, Jagati, part', say for me to Soma.<BR>
'Become lord of the Chandomas', say for me to Soma.<BR>
He who purchases King Soma after making it go to the world of lordship, becomes lord of his own (people). The world of lordship of King Soma is the metres; he should utter these verses before the purchase of Soma. It is to the world of lordship that he makes it go when he buys (Soma) [1], and he becomes lord of his own. He, who knows the support of the Tanunaptra finds support. The theologians say, 'They do not eat, nor offer; then where does the Tanunaptra find support?' 'In Prajapati, in the mind, he should reply. He should smell at it thrice, (saying), 'In Prajapati thee, in the mind I offer'; this indeed is the support of the Tanunaptra; he who knows thus finds support. He who [2] knows the support of the Adhvaryu finds support. He should call (on the Agnidhra) standing in the place without moving whence he is minded to sacrifice. This is the support of the Adhvaryu; he who knows thus finds support. If he were to sacrifice moving about, he would lose his support; therefore he should sacrifice standing in the same place, for support. He who knows the possession of the Adhvaryu, becomes possessed (of what he needs). His possession is the offering-spoon, his possession is the Vayu cup, his [3] possession is the beaker. If he were to call without holding the Vayu cup or the beaker, he would lose his own; therefore he must hold it when he calls; verily he loses not his own. If he begins the litany without placing the Soma," the Soma is not supported, the Stoma is not supported, the hymns are not supported, the sacrificer is not supported, the Adhvaryu is not supported. The support of the Soma is the Vayu cup, the support of it is the beaker, (the support) of the Stoma is Soma, (the support) of the hymns is the Stoma. He should grasp the cup or fill up the beaker, and then begin the litany; a support to the Soma he verily (<I>eva</I>) gives, to the Stoma, to the hymns; the sacrificer finds support, the Adhvaryu finds support.</P>
<H3>iii. 1. 3.</H3>
<P>They gather together the sacrifice when (they gather the dust of) the foot-print of the Soma cow; the oblation-holders are the mouth of the sacrifice; when they move forward the oblation-holders, then he should oil the axle with it; verily he extends the sacrifice in the mouth of the sacrifice. They lead Agni forward, they take the wife forward, and they make the carts follow after. Now the altar of him (Agni) is deserted; he broods on it, and is liable to become terrible (<I>rudr&aacute;</I>) [1], and lay to rest the offspring and cattle of the sacrificer. When they are leading northward the sacrificial animal over which the Apris have been said, he should take (from the altar the fire) for cooking it; verily he makes him share in it. The Ahavaniya is the sacrificer; if they take (the fire) for cooking the victim from the Ahavaniya, they tear the sacrificer asunder; the fire should therefore be thus, or he should make it by friction, so that the sacrificer's body may remain together. If a portion of the victim be lost, he should cut off an equivalent portion of the butter; that is then the atonement. If men disturb his victim and he wish of them, 'May they come to ruin', he should make an offering in the Agnidh's altar with the Rc containing the word 'paying of homage' (and beginning), 'What then?' Verily he appropriates their paying of homage and speedily do they go to ruin.</P>

<P>a The offspring, being born of Prajapati<BR>
And those that have been born,<BR>
To him declare them;<BR>
Lot the wise one reflect thereon.<BR>
b This victim, O lord of cattle, for thee to-day,<BR>
I bind, O Agni, in the midst of righteous action;<BR>
Approve it, and let us sacrifice with a good offering<BR>
May this offering be welcome to the gods.<BR>
c The ancient wise ones grasp<BR>
The breath as it speedeth from the limbs;<BR>
Go to heaven by the paths which lead to the gods;<BR>
Be among the plants with thy members.<BR>
d What cattle the lord of cattle ruleth [1],<BR>
Both the four-footed and the two-footed,<BR>
May he, bought off, go to his sacrificial share;<BR>
May abundances of wealth fall to the sacrificer.<BR>
e Those, who being bound, contemplated<BR>
With mind and with eye him who was being bound<BR>
Let the god Agni first release them,<BR>
Lord of offspring, in harmony with offspring.<BR>
f The cattle of the forest, of all forms,<BR>
Of various forms, many of one form.<BR>
Let the god Vayu first release them,<BR>
Lord of offspring, in harmony with offspring.<BR>
g Releasing [2] the seed of being,<BR>
Do ye further the sacrificer, O gods;<BR>
May that which hath stood ready and strenuous,<BR>
Go alive to the place of the gods.<BR>
h The breath of the sacrificer is apart from the victim;<BR>
The sacrifice goeth to the gods with the gods;<BR>
Let it go alive to the place of the gods;<BR>
Fulfilled may the desires of the sacrificer be.<BR>
i If the victim has uttered a cry,<BR>
Or striketh its breast with its feet,<BR>
May Agni release me from that sin,<BR>
From all misfortune.<BR>
k O ye slayers, come<BR>
To the sacrifice [3] sped by the gods;<BR>
Free the victim from the noose,<BR>
The lord of the sacrifice from the bond.<BR>
I May Aditi loosen this noose;<BR>
Homage to the cattle, to the lord of cattle, I pay;<BR>
I cast down the enemy;<BR>
On him whom we hate I fasten the noose.<BR>
m Thee they keep to carry the offering,<BR>
To cook (the victim) and as worthy of sacrifice;<BR>
0 Agni, with thy strength and thy body, be present<BR>
And accept our offerings, O Jatavedas.<BR>
n O Jatavedas, go with the caul to the gods,<BR>
For thou art the first Hotr;<BR>
With ghee do thou strengthen their bodies;<BR>
May the gods eat the offering made with the cry of 'hail!<BR>
o Hail to the gods; to the gods hail!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<H3>iii. 1. 5.</H3>
<P>Cattle belong to Prajapati; their overlord is Rudra. In that he prepares (them) with these two (verses), verily by addressing him with them he secures him, so that his self is not injured. He prepares (them) with two; the sacrificer has two feet; (verily it serves) for support. Having prepared them, he offers five libations; cattle are fivefold; I verily he wins cattle. Now the victim is led to death, and if he should lay hold on it, the sacrificer would be likely to die. ' The breath of the sacrifice is apart from the victim', he says, for distinction [1]. 'If the victim has uttered a cry'--(with these words) he offers a libation, for calming. 'O ye slayers, come to the sacrifices', he says; that is according to the text. When the omentum. is being taken, the strength goes away from Agni. 'Thee they keep to carry the offering'--(with these words) he pours a libation over the omentum; verily he wins the strength of Agni; (it serves) also for making (the victim) ready. In the case of some gods the cry of 'hail!' is uttered before (an offering), in the case of others the cry of 'hail!' is uttered after. 'Hail to the gods, to the gods hail!'--(with these words) he pours a libation on either side of the omentum; verily he delights both (sets of gods).</P>
<H3>iii. 1. 6.</H3>
<P>a 'He who performs the sacrifice not according to the deities falls a victim to the deities, he becomes worse. He who (performs) in accordance with the deities does not fall a victim to the deities, he becomes better. He should rub the Agnidh's place with a verse addressed to Agni, the oblation-holder with one addressed to Visnu, the offering-spoons with one addressed to Agni, the Vayu cups with one addressed to Vayu, the Sadas with one addressed to Indra. Thus he forms the sacrifice in accordance with the deities, he does not fall a victim to the deities, he becomes better.<BR>
b I yoke earth for thee with light, I yoke wind for thee with the atmosphere [1], I yoke speech for thee with the sun, I yoke the three spaces of the sun for thee.<BR>
c Agni is the deity, Gayatri the metre, thou art the vessel of the silent offering. Soma is the deity, Tristubh the metre, thou art the vessel of the restrained offering. Indra is the deity, Jagati the metre, thou art the vessel of Indra and Vayu. Brhaspati is the deity, Anustubh the metre, thou art the vessel of Mitra and Varuna. The A&ccedil;vins are the deity, Pa&ntilde;kti the metre, thou art the vessel of the A&ccedil;vins. Surya is the deity, Brhati the metre [2], thou art the vessel of the pure (Soma). Candramas is the deity, Satobrhati the metre, thou art the vessel of the mixed (Soma). The All-gods are the deity, Usnih the metre, thou art the vessel of the opening offering. Indra is the deity, Kakubh the metre, thou art the vessel of the hymns. Earth is the deity, Viraj the metre, thou art the vessel of the reserved (offering).</P>
<H3>iii. 1. 7.</H3>
<P>The Adhvaryu is he that brings trouble on the sacrificer, and he that brings trouble himself is ruined before the trouble. 'From the formula spoken, guard me, from every execration'--(with these words) he should pour a libation before the morning litany (of the Hotr). So the Adhvaryu girds himself in front with a protection, to avert trouble.</P>
<P>For entry thee, for rest thee, for the overcoming of the Gayatri, of the Tristubh, of the Jagati, hail! O expiration and inspiration, protect me from death, O expiration and inspiration forsake me not.</P>
<P>They contend as to the deities and to expiration and inspiration [1], whose Soma (offerings) compete. 'For entry thee, for rest thee', he says; entry and rest are the metres; verily by the metres he appropriates his metres. The Ajya (Stotras) have the word 'forward' in them, for conquest. The beginning verses are addressed to the Maruts, for victory. Both the Brhat and the Rathantara (Samans) are used. The Rathantara is this (earth), the What yonder (sky); verily he cuts him off from these two. The Rathantara is to-day, the Brhat to-morrow; verily he cuts him off from to-day and to-morrow. The Rathantara is the past [2], the Brhat the future; verily he cuts him off from the past and the future. The Rathantara is the measured, the Brhat the unmeasured; verily he cuts him off from the measured and the unmeasured. Vi&ccedil;vamitra and Jamadagni had a quarrel with Vasistha. Jamadagni saw this Vihavya (hymn), and by means of it he appropriated the power and strength of Vasistha. In that the Vihavya is recited, the sacrificer appropriates the power and strength of his enemy. 'He who performs more rites of sacrifice', they say, 'appropriates the gods.' If the Soma (sacrifice) on the other side is an Agnistoma, he should perform an Ukthya; if it is an Ukthya, he should perform an Atiratra; verily by means of rites of sacrifice he appropriates his deities; he becomes better.</P>
<H3>iii. 1. 8.</H3><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>a Ye are the Nigrabhyas, heard by the gods. Delight my life, delight my expiration, delight my inspiration, delight my cross-breathing, delight my eye, delight my ear, delight my mind, delight my speech, delight my trunk, delight my limbs, delight my offspring, delight my cattle, delight my house, delight my troops, delight me with all my troops, delight me [1]; may my troops not go thirsty.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>b The plants are the subjects of Soma; the subjects indeed are able to give up the king; Soma is connected with Indra. 'I have made you grow in my mind, O ye well born; O ye born of right, may we enjoy your favour; may the divine plants in accord with Indra grant us the Soma for the pressing', he says verily having begged him from the plants, his subjects, and his deity he presses him.<BR>
c When the Soma is pressed [2] the first drop which falls has potency to destroy the power, strength, offspring, and cattle of the sacrificer; he should pronounce over it the formula, 'Thou hast fallen to me with offspring, with abundance of wealth; destroy not my power and strength'; verily he invokes this blessing to prevent the destruction of his power, strength, offering, and cattle.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>d The drop hath fallen on the earth, the sky,<BR>
On this seat and on the one which was aforetime<BR>
The drop that wandereth over the third seat<BR>
I offer in the seven Hotras.'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<H3>iii. 1. 9.</H3>
<P>a He who bestows upon the gods the glory of the gods, and on men the glory of men, has the divine glory among the gods, the human glory among men. The libations which he draws off before the Agrayana libation, he should draw off silently; those after with noise; verily he bestows upon the gods the glory of the gods, and on men the glory of men; verily he has the divine glory among the gods, the human glory among men.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>b May Agni protect us at the morning pressing,<BR>
He that belongeth to all men, all-wealful in his might;<BR>
May he, the purifier, grant us wealth [1];<BR>
May we that share the draught be long-lived<BR>
c May the All-gods, the Maruts, Indra,<BR>
Not leave us at the second pressing;<BR>
Long-lived, speaking what is pleasing to them,<BR>
May we enjoy the favour of the gods.<BR>
d This third libation belongeth to the sages<BR>
Who righteously set the beaker in motion;<BR>
May these Saudhanvanas, who have attained heaven,<BR>
Bear our good offering to what is better </P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>e Some libations have bases, some have not. Those which have a sprinkling have bases, those [2] of Soma have not bases. Taking (the cup) for Indra and Vayu he should sprinkle it (saying), 'May the sacrifice be harmless for plants, for our cattle, for our folk; for all creatures harmless thou art; swell like ghee, O god Soma.' Verily so he makes the libations of Soma to have a base. He becomes possessed of a base who knows thus. Verily also he wets with ghee the sky and earth: they being wet are to be lived upon; he is to be lived upon [3] who knows thus.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>f This is thy share, O Rudra, for which thou didst ask; rejoice in it, find (for us) the lordship of cows, abundance of wealth, with good heroes and a year's prosperity.'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>g Manu divided his property among his sons. He deprived Nabhanedistha, who was a student, of any portion. He went to him, and said, 'How hast thou deprived me of a portion?' He replied, 'I have not deprived you of a portion; the Angirases here are performing a Sattra; they [4] cannot discern the world of heaven; declare this Brahmana to them; when they go to the, world of heaven they will give thee their cattle.' He told them it, and they when going to the world of heaven gave him their cattle. Rudra approached him as he went about with his cattle in the place of sacrifice, and said, 'These are my cattle.' He replied, 'They have given them [5] to me.' They have not the power to do that', he replied, (whatever is left on the place of sacrifice is mine.' Then one should not resort to a place of sacrifice. He said, 'Give me a share in the sacrifice, and I will not have designs against your cattle. He poured out for him the remnants of the mixed (Soma). Then indeed had Rudra no designs against his cattle. When one who knows thus offers the remnants of the mixed (Soma), Rudra has no designs against his cattle.</P>
<H3>iii. 1. 10.</H3><DIR>

<P>a May I be pleasing to speech; pleasing to the lord of speech, O divine speech. The sweetness of speech place in me; hail to Sarasvati.<BR>
b By the Rc make the Soma to prosper,<BR>
By the Gayatra the Rathantara,<BR>
The Brhat with the Gayatri for its metre.<BR>
c The drop that falleth of them, that shoot,<BR>
Shaken by the arms, from the womb of the pressing-planks,<BR>
Or from the filter of the Adhvaryu,<BR>
Over it I say Hail! and offer it to Indra.<BR>
d The drop, the shoot, that hath fallen on the ground,<BR>
From the rice grains [1], the cake, the mush,<BR>
From the Soma with grain, from the mixed, O Indra, from the pure,<BR>
Over it I say Hail! and offer it to Indra.<BR>
e Thy sweet drop, powerful,<BR>
Over which Hail! is said and which goeth back to the gods<BR>
From the sky, the earth, the atmosphere<BR>
Over it I say Hail! and offer it to Indra.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>f The Adhvaryu is the first of the priests to start work, verily they say the Stoma should be started by him.<BR>
g 'May speech that goes in front go in front, going straight to the gods, placing glory in me, breath in cattle, offspring in me [2] and in the sacrificer', he says; verily he yokes speech at the beginning of the sacrifice. The place of the sacrifice is made when having drawn off the libations they creep to the Bahispavamana; for they go away, and they praise with verses which go away; he returns, and with a verse addressed to Visnu reverences (the Soma); Visnu is the sacrifice; verily he makes the sacrifice. 'O Visnu, as our nearest, O mighty one, grant us protection; the streams dripping honey milk for thee the unfailing source', he says; verily he makes to swell by it whatever of the Soma has dried up through lying (in the barrels).</P>

</I><P>iii. 2. 1. He who sacrifices knowing the 'ascent' verses of the Pavamana (Stotras) mounts on the Pavamanas and is not cut off from the Pavamanas. 'Thou art the hawk, with the Gayatri for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in safety. Thou art the eagle, with the Tristubh for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in safety. Thou art the vulture, with the Jagati for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in safety', he says. These [1] are the ascents of the Pavamanas; he who knowing thus these sacrifices mounts on the Pavamanas, and is not cut off from the Pavamanas. He who knows the continuity of the Pavamana lives all his days; he does not die before his time; be becomes rich in cattle; he obtains offspring. The Pavamana cups are drawn off, but these are not drawn off by him, the wooden vessel, the stirring-vessel, and the vessel which holds the purified Soma. If he were to begin (the Stotra) without drawing them off, he would split the Pavamana [2], and with its being split the breath of the Adhvaryu would be split. 'Thou art taken with a support; to Prajapati thee!', (with these words) he should rub the wooden vessel; 'to Indra thee!', (with these words) the stirring-vessel; 'to the All-gods thee!', (with these words) the vessel which holds the purified Soma verily he renders continuous the Pavamana, he lives all his days; he does not die before his time; he becomes rich in cattle; he obtains offspring.</P>
<H3>iii. 2. 2.</H3>
<P>There are three pressings. Now they spoil the third pressing if there are no stalks of the Soma in it. Having offered the silent cup, he puts a shoot in the vessel which holds it, and placing it with the third pressing he should press it out. In that he makes it swell, it has a stalk (of the Soma); in that he presses it out, it has the lees (of the Soma); verily he makes all the pressings have stalks and pure Soma, and be of equal strength.</P><DIR>

<P>Two oceans are there extended, unperishing;<BR>
They revolve in turns like the waves in the bosom of the sea;<BR>
Seeing they pass over one of them,<BR>
Seeing not [1] they pass over the other with a bridge.<BR>
Two garments continuous one weareth;<BR>
With locks, knowing all the worlds;<BR>
He goeth in secret clad in the dark;<BR>
He putteth on his bright robe abandoning that of the worn-out one.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Whatever the gods did at the sacrifice the Asuras did. The gods saw this great sacrifice, they extended it, they performed the Agnihotra as the vow; therefore one should perform the vow twice, for twice they offer the Agnihotra. They performed the full moon rite, as the animal sacrifice to Agni and Soma [2]. They performed the new moon rite, as the animal sacrifice to Agni. They performed the sacrifice to the All-gods as the morning pressing. They performed the Varunapraghasas, as the midday pressing. They performed the Sakamedhas, the sacrifice to the fathers, and the offering to Tryambaka, as the third pressing. The Asuras sought to follow their sacrifice, but could not get on its tracks. They said, 'These gods have become inviolable (<I>adhvartavyah</I>). That is why the sacrifice (<I>adhvara</I>) is inviolable. Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. He who knowing thus offers the Soma, prospers himself, the enemy is defeated.</P>

<P>a Surrounding Agni, surrounding Indra, surrounding the All-gods, surrounding me with splendour, be purified for us, with healing for cattle, healing for men, healing for the horses, healing, O king, for the plants; may we possess the abundance of wealth that is thine who art unbroken and of heroic power, O lord of wealth; of that give me, of that may I share, of that that is thine I procure this.<BR>

<P>In that the Hotr addresses the Adhvaryu, he makes the thunder bolt advance towards him; 'O reciter of hymns', he says in response at the morning pressing; the syllables herein are three, the Gayatri has three Padas, the morning pressing is connected with the Gayatri; verily with the Gayatri he places the thunderbolt within the morning pressing. 'The hymn hath been uttered', he says in response at the midday pressing; the syllables herein are four, the Tristubh has four Padas, the midday pressing is connected with the Tristubh; verily with the Tristubh he places the thunderbolt within the midday pressing [1]. 'The hymn hath been uttered to Indra', he says in response at the third pressing; the syllables herein are seven, the &Ccedil;akvari has seven Padas, the thunder bolt is connected with the &Ccedil;akvari; verily with the thunderbolt he places the thunderbolt within the third pressing. The theologians say, 'He indeed would be an Adhvaryu who should produce the metres in the responses according to the pressings; he would bestow brilliance upon himself at the morning pressing, power at the midday pressing, and cattle at the third pressing.' 'O reciter of hymns', he says in response at the morning pressing; the syllables herein are three, [2], the Gayatri has three Padas, the morning pressing is connected with the Gayatri; verily at the morning pressing he produces the metres in the response; now the Gayatri is brilliance, the morning pressing is brilliance; verily at the morning pressing he bestows brilliance upon himself. 'The hymn hath been uttered', he says in response at the midday pressing; the syllables herein are four, the Tristubh has four Padas, the midday pressing is connected with the Tristubh; verily at the midday pressing he produces the metres in the response; now the Tristubh is power, the midday pressing is power [3]; verily at the midday pressing he bestows power upon himself. 'The hymn hath been uttered to Indra', he says in response at the third pressing; the syllables herein are seven, the &Ccedil;akvari has seven Padas, cattle are connected with the &Ccedil;akvari, the third pressing is connected with the Jagati; verily at the third pressing he produces the metres in the response; now the Jagati is cattle, the third pressing is cattle; verily at the third pressing he bestows cattle upon himself that the Hotr addresses the Adhvaryu, he puts fear in him; if be were not to smite it off [4], they would have fear in his house before the year (was over). 'Recite, let us two rejoice',' he responds, and thereby he smites it off. Just as one looks for the exact interval, so the Adhvaryu looks for the response. If he were to respond in advance, that would be as when one goes to meets the exact interval. If the (response) were to be omitted after the half-verse, that would be as when one is left behind those that are running. The Udgithas are similar for the priests, the Udgitha for the Udgatrs, [5], the Rces and the Pranavas for the singers of hymns, the response for the Adhvaryus. He, who knowing thus responds, becomes an eater of food, a strong one is born among his offspring. The Hotr is this (earth), the Adhvaryu yonder (sky); in that he recites sitting, so the Hotr goes not away from the (earth), for this (earth) is seated as it were; verily thereby the sacrifice milks this (earth). In that he responds standing, so the Adhvaryu goes not away from yonder (sky) [6], for yonder (sky) stands as it were; verily thereby the sacrificer milks yonder (sky). In that he recites sitting, therefore the gods live on that which is given hence; in that he responds standing, therefore men live on what is given thence. In that he recites seated towards the east, and he responds standing towards the west, therefore seed is impregnated in front, offspring are born behind. In that the Hotr addresses the Adhvaryu, he makes the thunderbolt advance towards him; he turns towards the West; verily he overcomes the thunderbolt.</P>

In that the various (cups) are drawn, so the sacrificer wins various delights. 'Thou art the wind, expiration [2] by name', he says; verily he wins expiration and inspiration.' 'Thou art the eye, the ear by name', he says; verily he wins life. 'Thou art the form, colour by name', he says; verily he wins offspring. 'Thou art holy order, truth by name', he says; verily he wins lordly power. 'Thou art the past, the future by name', he says; the foetus of the waters and the plants is cattle; verily he wins cattle [3]. So much as is around a man, that does he thus win. 'Thee for the realm of holy order', he says; the realm of holy order is this (earth); verily he conquers this (earth). 'Thee for the might of holy order', he says; the might of holy order is the atmosphere; verily he conquers the atmosphere. 'Thee for the circumference of holy order', he says; the circumference of holy order is the sky; verily he conquers the sky. 'Thee for the truth of holy order' [4], he says; the truth of holy order is the quarters; verily he conquers the quarters. 'Thee for the light of holy order', he says; the light of holy order is the world of heaven; verily he conquers the world of heaven. So many are the worlds of the gods; verily he conquers them. They make up ten; the Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily he finds support in the Viraj, the eating of food.</P>
<H3>iii. 3. 6.</H3>
<P>What the gods could not win by the sacrifice, that they won by the Para (Grahas), and that is why the Paras have their name. In that the Paras are drawn, (it serves) to win that which one does not win by the sacrifice. The first he draws, by this he conquers the world; the second (he draws), by this he conquers the atmosphere; the third (he draws), by this he conquers yonder world. In that they are drawn, (they serve) to conquer these worlds [1]. In the latter days they are drawn hitherward from yonder, verily having conquered these worlds they descend again towards this world. In that in the former days they are drawn thitherward from hence, therefore these worlds are thitherward from hence; in that in the latter days they are drawn hitherward from thence, therefore these worlds are hitherward from thence; therefore men depend on the worlds in variation. The theologians say, 'For what reason do plants spring from the waters, the food of man is plants [2], and offspring are born through Prajapati?' 'Through the Paras', he should reply. In that he draws (saying),'For the waters thee, for the plants I take', therefore from the waters plants spring; in that he draws (saying), 'For the plants thee, for offspring I take', therefore the food of man is the plants; in that he draws (saying), 'For offspring thee, for Prajapati I take', therefore through Prajapati offspring are born.</P>
<H3>iii. 3. 7.</H3>
<P>Prajapati created the gods and the Asuras; thereafter the sacrifice was created, after the sacrifice the metres; they went away in all directions, the sacrifice went after the Asuras, the metres after the sacrifice; the gods reflected, 'These have become what we are'; they had recourse to Prajapati; Prajapati said, 'Taking the strength of the metres I shall bestow it upon you.' He took the strength of the metres [1] and bestowed it upon them. Then the metres ran away, and the sacrifice followed the metres. Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. He who knows the strength of the metres--'Do thou proclaim', 'Be it proclaimed', 'Utter', 'We that utter', the Vasat call--prospers himself, his foe is defeated. The theologians say, 'For whose gain does the Adhvaryu cause (him) to proclaim?' 'For the strength of the metres', he should reply; 'Do thou proclaim', 'Be it proclaimed', 'Utter', 'We that utter', the Vasat call, that is the strength of the metres [2]; he who knows thus sings what ever he sings with the metres in full strength. 'In that Indra, slew Vrtra, there is impurity, in that he destroyed the Yatis, there is impurity; then why is the sacrifice Indra's up to the completion?' they say. The sacrifice is the sacrificial body of Indra, and it is this they sacrifice. To him who knows thus the sacrifice resorts.</P>

<P>The sacrificer falls a victim to the two fires in that having made (the offering) ready in them he goes elsewhere to the final bath; 'Giving life, O Agni, rejoicing in the oblation', (with these words) should he offer when about to go to the final bath; verily by the offering he appeases the two (fires); the sacrificer does not go to destruction.</P><DIR>

<P>Yama is Agni, Yama is this (earth); the sacrificer becomes under a debt to Yama in that he strews the altar with plants; if he were to go away with out burning (them), they would drag him about bound by the neck [3] in yonder world. In that he burns, (saying) 'The loan which I have not yet paid', being here, having made requital of the loan to Yama, he goes freed from the debt to the world of heaven. If he does manifold things as it were, he should offer in the forest (fire) groats with his hand; the forest (fire) is Agni Vai&ccedil;vanara; verily he appeases him. On the Ekastaka the divider of the days, he should cook a cake of four &Ccedil;aravas in size, and early with it should fire the thicket; if [4] it burns, it becomes a good season, if it does not burn, a bad season. By this mode of prognostication the seers of old used to undertake a long Sattra. He who knowing the seer, the hearer, the reciter, sacrifices, is united in yonder world with what he has sacrificed and bestowed. The seer is Agni, the hearer is Vayu, the reciter Aditya; he, who offers knowing thus to them, in yonder world is united with what be has sacrificed and bestowed. 'May he from in front with the cloud' [5], he says; (he that is) from in front with the cloud is Agni; verily he says to Agni, 'Guard this for me.' 'Do thou, O lord of cloud', he says; the lord of cloud is Vayu; verily he says to Vayu, 'Guard this for me.' 'O god, that dost fatten', he says; the god that fattens is yonder Aditya; verily he says to Aditya, 'Guard this for me.'</P>

<P>The sacrifice of him whose offering is too large is unsuccessful; 'Surya, the god, for those that sit in the sky', he says; verily with the aid of Brhaspati and Prajapati he makes good the deficiency in the sacrifice. Now the Raksases infest the victim if it being offered to one deity is greater (than normal); 'Thou who hast a tawny embryo', he says; verily he sends it to the gods, to smite away the Raksases. 'Bring near, O bringer', he says [1]; verily with the holy power he brings it. 'I split apart thy urinator', he says; that is according to the text. 'The drop, far extending, of all forms', he says; the drop is offspring and cattle; verily with offspring and cattle he unites him. To the sky the deficiency of the sacrifice goes, to the earth the redundancy; if he were not to appease it, the sacrificer would be ruined; 'May the two great ones, sky and earth, for us' [2], he says; verily by means of sky and earth he appeases both the deficiency and the redundancy of the sacrifice; the sacrificer is not ruined. He covers (the offering) with ashes for the call of 'Godspeed'; now this is the embryo of these two; verily in these two he deposits it. If he were to cut off, he would make it redundant; if he were not to cut off, he would fail to cut off from the victim which has been offered; one portion he should cut off from in front of the navel, another behind it; the expiration is in front of the navel [3], the inspiration behind; verily he cuts off from the whole extent of the victim. He offers to Visnu &Ccedil;ipivista; Visnu &Ccedil;ipivista is the redundancy of the sacrifice, the greatness of the victim, the prosperity thereof; verily in the redundant he deposits the redundant, to appease the redundant. The sacrificial fee is gold of eight measures, for the (victim) has eight feet; the self is the ninth; (verily it serves) to win the victim. It is enveloped in a turban in an inner box, for so as it were is the victim, the omentum, the skin, the flesh, the bone; verily he obtains and wins the whole extent of the victim. He, for whom in the sacrifice this expiration is offered, by his sacrificing becomes richer.</P>

<P>These two were together, Vayu blew them apart; they conceived a child, Soma generated it, Agni swallowed it. Prajapati saw this (offering) to Agni on eight potsherds, he offered it, and thereby he redeemed this (victim) from Agni. Therefore though sacrificing it to another god, still one should first offer on eight potsherds to Agni; verily redeeming it from Agni he offers it. Because [1] Vayu blew (them apart), therefore is it connected with Vayu; because these two conceived, therefore is it connected with sky and earth; because Soma generated, and Agni swallowed, there fore is it connected with Agni and Soma; because when the two parted speech was uttered, therefore is it connected with Sarasvati; because Prajapati redeemed it from Agni, therefore is it connected with Prajapati; the barren goat is connected with all the gods. To Vayu should he offer it who desires wealth. the swiftest deity is Vayu; verily he has recourse to Vayu with his own share [2], and he causes him to attain wealth. To sky and earth should he offer it who in ploughing desires support; verily from the sky Parjanya rains for him, plants spring up in this (earth), his corn prospers. To Agni and Soma should he offer it who desires, 'May I be possessed of food, an eater of food'; by Agni he wins food, by Soma the eating of food; verily he becomes possessed of food, an eater of food. To Sarasvati should he offer it who [3], being able to utter speech, cannot utter speech; Sarasvati is speech; verily he has recourse to Sarasvati with her own share, and she bestows speech upon him. To Prajapati should he offer it who desires, 'May I gain that which has not been gained'; all the deities are Prajapati; verily by the deities he gains what has not been gained. He brings (the victims) up with a verse ad dressed to Vayu; verily winning it from Vayu he offers it. 'For intent thee, for desire thee!' [4] he says; that is according to the text. He offers with the sound <I>kikkita</I>; at the sound <I>kikkita</I> the domestic animals stop, the wild run away. In that he offers with the sound <I>kikkita</I>, (it serves) to support domestic animals. He offers while the circumambulation by fire is taking place; verily alive he sends it to the world of heaven. 'Thou, the fourth, art the barren, the eager one', he says; verily he sends it to the gods. 'Be the desires of the sacrificer fulfilled', he says; this is the desire [5] of the sacrificer that (the sacrifice) should proceed to its conclusion without injury. 'Thou art the goat, resting in wealth', he says; verily in these worlds he makes it find support. 'In the sky be thy great radiance', he says; verily in the world of heaven he bestows light upon him. 'Stretching the thread of the atmosphere do thou pursue the light', he says; verily he makes these worlds full of light for him. 'Weave ye without a flaw the work of the singers, [6], he says; whatever flaw is committed in the sacrifice, this serves to atone for it. 'Become Manu; produce thou the host divine', he says; offspring are connected with Manu; verily he makes them fit for food. 'Thou art the offering of mind', he says, to make 'Godspeed'. 'May we share thy limbs', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. Of this (victim) there is one time unpropitious for sacrifice to the gods, when a cloud appears when it has been offered [7]; if a cloud should appear when it has been offered, he should either cast it into the waters or eat it whole; if he were to cast it into the waters, he would con fuse the sacrifice; he should eat it whole; verily he bestows power upon himself. By three people is this to be performed, him who performs a year-long Sattra, him who offers with a thousand (gifts), and him who is a domestic sacrificer; with it let them sacrifice, for them is it fit.</P>

They should be offered for one who desires a village; the Rastrabhrts are the kingdom, his fellows are the kingdom; verily with the kingdom he wins for him his fellows and the kingdom; he becomes possessed of a village [1]. He offers on the dicing-place; verily on the dicing-place he wins his fellows for him, and being won they wait upon him. They should be offered on the mouth of the chariot for him who desires force; the Rastrabhrts are force, the chariot is force; verily by force he wins force for him; he becomes possessed of force. They should be offered for him who is expelled from his kingdom; to all his chariots he should say, 'Be yoked'; verily he yokes the kingdom for him [2]. The oblations of him whose realm is not in order are disordered; he should take off the right wheel of his chariot and offer in the box; so he puts in order his oblation, and the kingdom comes into order in accord with their coming into order. They should be offered when battle is joined; the Rastrabhrts are the kingdom, and for the kingdom do they strive who go to battle together; he for whom first they offer prospers, and wins this battle. The kindling-wood is from the Madhuka tree [3]; the coals shrinking back make the host of his foe to shrink back. They should be offered for one who is mad; for it is the Gandharva and the Apsarases who madden him who is mad; the Rastrabhrts are the Gandharva and the Apsarases. 'To him hail! To them hail!'

They should be offered in inverse order by one who is practising witchcraft; so he fastens on his breaths from in front, and then at pleasure lays him low. He offers in a natural cleft or hollow; that of this (earth) is seized by misfortune; verily on (a place) seized by misfortune he makes misfortune seize upon him. With what is harsh in speech he utters the Vasat call; verily with the harshness of speech he cuts him down; swiftly he is ruined. If he desire of a man, 'Let me take his eating of food' [5], he should fall at length in his hall and (with the words), 'O lord of the world', gather blades of grass; the lord of the world is Prajapati; verily by Prajapati he takes his eating of food. 'Here do I take the eating of food of N. N., descendant of N. N.', he says; verily he takes his eating of food. With six (verses) he takes, the seasons are six; verily the seasons having taken by Prajapati his eating of food bestow it on him [6]. If the head of a family is expelled, they should be offered for him, placing him on a mound and cooking a Brahman's mess of four &Ccedil;aravas in size; the Rastrabhrts are pre-eminence, the mound is pre-eminence; verily by pre-eminence he makes him pre-eminent among his equals. (The offering) is of four &Ccedil;aravas in size; verily he finds support in the quarters; it is made in milk; verily he bestows brilliance upon him; he takes it out, to make it cooked; it is full of butter, for purity; four descended from Rsis partake of it; verily he offers in the light of the quarters.</P>

These (offerings) also should he make who desires cattle; the minor deities are the metres, cattle are as it were the metres [1]; verily by the metres he produces offspring for him. He makes Dhatr first; by him he scatters, Anumati gives approval to him, Raka gives, Sinivali produces, and by Kuhu he establishes offspring when produced. These (offerings) also should he make who desires a village; the minor deities are the metres, a village is as it were the metres; verily by the metres he wins a village for him [2]. He puts Dhatr in the middle; verily he places him in the middle of a village. These (offerings) also should he offer who is long ill; the minor deities are the metres, the metres are unfavourable to him whose illness is long; verily by the metres he makes him well. He puts Dhatr in the middle, it is not in order in the middle of him whose illness is long; verily thereby in the middle he puts (things) in order for him. These (offerings) also [3] should he offer to whom the sacrifice does not resort; the minor deities are the metres, the metres do not resort to him to whom the sacrifice does not resort. He puts Dhatr first; verily in his mouth he places the metres; the sacrifice resorts to him. These (offerings) also should he make who has sacrificed; the minor deities are the metres, the metres of him who has sacrificed are worn out as it were. He puts Dhatr last [4]; verily afterwards he wins for him metres unwearied; the next sacrifice resorts to him. These (offerings) should he make to whom wisdom does not resort; the minor deities are the metres, the metres do not resort to him to whom wisdom does not resort. He puts Dhatr first; verily in his mouth he places the metres; wisdom resorts to him. These (offerings) also should he make [5] who desires brilliance; the minor deities are the metres, brilliance is as it were the metres; verily by the metres he bestows brilliance upon him. They are made in milk; verily he bestows brilliance upon him. He puts Dhatr in the middle; verily he places him in the middle of brilliance. Anumati is the Gayatri, Raka the Tristubh, Sinivali the Jagati, Kuhu the Anustubh, Dhatr the Vasat call. Raka is the first fortnight, Kuhu the second, Sinivali the new moon (night), Anumati the full moon (night), Dhatr the moon. The Vasus are eight [6], the Gayatri has eight syllables; the Rudras are eleven, the Tristubh has eleven syllables; the Adityas are twelve, the Jagati has twelve syllables, the Anustubh is Prajapati, the Vasat call Dhatr. Thus indeed the minor deities are all the metres and all the gods and the Vasat call. If he were to offer them all at once, they would be likely to burn him up; he should offer first two, and a third for Dhatr, and then offer likewise the last two; thus they do not burn him up, and for whatever desire they are offered that he obtains by them.</P>

<P>In that evening and morning he offers the Agnihotra the sacrificer thus piles up the oblation bricks [1]; the bricks of him who has established a sacred fire are the days and nights; in that he offers evening and morning, verily he obtains the days and nights, and making them into bricks piles them up. He offers ten in the same place; the Viraj has ten syllables; verily having obtained the Viraj, he makes it into a brick and piles it up; verily in the Viraj he obtains the sacrifice; the piling up must be repeated by him. Therefore that is the place of sacrifice where he advances having spent ten (nights); not suitable is the place where (he spends) less time than that [2] Now Vastospati is Rudra. If he were to go on without offering to Vastospati, the fire becoming Rudra would leap after him and slay him; he offers to Vastospati; verily with his own share he appeases him; the sacrificer does not come to ruin. If he were to offer with the chariot yoked, that would be as when one offers an oblation on a place he has left; if he were to offer without the chariot being yoked, that would be as when one offers an oblation at rest; verily no offering would be made to Vastospati [3]. The right (animal) is yoked, the left not yoked, and thus he offers to Vastospati; verily he does both, and appeases him completely. If he were to offer with one (verse) he would make (it) a ladle offering; having pronounced the Puronuvakya he offers with the Yajya, to win the gods. If he were to load (his cart) after the offering, he would make Rudra enter his house. If he were to set out without extinguishing the smouldering embers, it would be like a con fusion of the sacrifice or a burning. 'This is thy birthplace in season', (with these words) he places (the embers) on the kindling-sticks [4]; this is the birthplace of Agni; verily he mounts it on its own birthplace. Now they say, 'If being placed on the kindling-sticks it should be lost, his fire would be dispersed, it would have to be piled up again. 'With thy body, O Agni, worthy of sacrifice, come hither and mount', (with these words) he makes it mount on himself; the birthplace of fire is the sacrificer; verily on its own birthplace he causes it to mount.</P>

<P>The Adityas and the Angirases piled up the fires, they desired to obtain the new and the full moon (offerings); the Angirases offered the oblation, then the Adityas saw these two offerings, and offered them; then they first grasped the new and full moon (offerings) [2]. He who is commencing the new and full moon (sacrifices) should first offer these two (offerings); verily straightway he commences the new and full moon (sacrifices). The theologians say, 'He indeed would begin the new and full moon (sacrifices) who should know the normal and reversed order'. What follows on the new moon is the normal, what is after the full moon is the reversed order; if he were to begin the full moon (offering) first, he would offer these two (libations) in reverse order; he would waste away as the moon waned [3]; he should offer these libations to Sarasvant and Sarasvati in front; Sarasvati is the new moon; verily he commences them in normal order; he waxes as the moon waxes. He should offer first on eleven potsherds to Agni and Visnu, to Sarasvati an oblation, to Sarasvant on twelve potsherds. In that it is (offered) to Agni, and the mouth of the sacrifice is Agni, verily he places in front prosperity and the mouth of the sacrifice; in that it is (offered) to Visnu, and Visnu is the sacrifice, verily commencing the sacrifice he continues it. There is an oblation for Sarasvati, and (an offering) on twelve potsherds for Sarasvant; Sarasvati is the new moon, Sarasvant is the full moon; verily straightway he commences these (offerings), he prospers by them. That to Sarasvant is on twelve potsherds, for pairing, for generation. The sacrificial fee is a pair of kine, for prosperity.</P>

<P>The Rsis could not see Indra face to face; Vasistha saw him face to face; he said, 'Holy lore shall I proclaim to you so that people will be propagated with thee as Purohita; therefore do thou proclaim me to the other Rsis.' To him he proclaimed these shares in the Stoma, therefore people were propagated with Vasistha as their Purohita; therefore a Vasistha should be chosen as the Brahman priest; verily he is propagated. 'Thou art the ray; for dwelling thee! Quicken the dwelling' [1], he says; the dwelling is the gods; verily to the gods he announces the sacrifice. 'Thou art advance; for right thee! Quicken right', he says; right is men; verily to men he announces the sacrifice. 'Thou art following; for sky thee! Quicken the sky', he says; verily to these worlds he announces the sacrifice. 'Thou art a prop; for rain thee! Quicken rain', he says; verily he wins rain [2]. 'Thou art blowing forward; thou art blowing after', he says, for pairing. 'Thou art the eager; for the Vasus thee! Quicken the Vasus', he says; the Vasus are eight, the Rudras eleven, the Adityas twelve; so many are the gods; verily to them he announces the sacrifice. 'Thou art force; to the Pitrs thee! Quicken the Pitrs', he says; verily the gods and the Pitrs he connects. 'Thou art the thread; for offspring thee! Quicken offspring' [3], he says; verily the Pitrs and offspring he connects. 'Thou dost endure the battle; for cattle thee! Quicken cattle', he says; verily offspring and cattle he connects. 'Thou art wealthy; for the plants thee! Quicken the plants', he says; verily in the plants he makes cattle find support. 'Thou art the victorious, with ready stone; for Indra thee! Quicken Indra', he says, for victory. 'Thou art the overlord; for breath thee! Quicken breath' [4], he says; verily upon offspring he bestows breath. 'Thou art the Trivrt, thou art the Pravrt', he says, for pairing. 'Thou art the mounter, thou art the descender', he says, for propagating. 'Thou art the wealthy, thou art the brilliant, thou art the gainer of good', he says, for support.</P>

<P>The gods are destroyers of the sacrifice, stealers of the sacrifice [2]; they sit these worlds taking and destroying from him who gives and sacrifices. 'The gods, destroyers of the sacrifice, that sit on the earth, that (sit) in the atmosphere, that sit in the sky', he says; verily traversing the worlds, he goes to the world of heaven with his household, with his cattle. From him who has sacrificed with the Soma (sacrifice), the deities and the sacrifice depart; he should offer to Agni on five potsherds as the final act; all the deities are Agni [3], the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the deities and the sacrifice. Now Agni is connected with the Gayatri and has the Gayatri as his metre; he severs him from his metre, if he offers on five potsherds; it should be made on eight potsherds; the Gayatri has eight syllables, Agni is connected with the Gayatri and has the Gayatri for his metre; verily he unites him with his own metre. The Yajya and the Anuvakya are in the Pa&ntilde;kti metre the sacrifice is fivefold; verily thereby he does not depart from the sacrifice.</P>

<H3>iii. 5. 7.</H3>
<P>The Vasat call cleft the head of the Gayatri; its sap fell away, it entered the earth, it became the Khadira; he, whose dipping-spoon is make of Khadira wood, cuts off with the sap of the metres; his oblations are full of sap. Soma was in the third sky from hence; the Gayatri fetched it, a leaf of it was cut off, that became the Parna, that is why the Parna is so called. He whose ladle is made of Parna wood [1] has his oblations acceptable; the gods rejoice in his oblation. The gods discussed regarding holy power; the Parna overheard it; he whose ladle is made of Parna wood is styled famous; he hears no evil bruit. The Parna is holy power, the Maruts are the people, the people are food, the A&ccedil;vattha is connected with the Maruts; he whose ladle is made of Parna wood, and his spoon (<I>upabhrt</I>) is of A&ccedil;vattha, by holy power wins food, and the holy class [2] puts over the people. The Parna is the royalty, the A&ccedil;vattha is the people; in that the ladle is made of Parna wood and the spoon of A&ccedil;vattha, verily he puts the royalty over the people. Prajapati sacrificed; where the oblation found support, thence sprung the Vikankata; there he created offspring; the oblation of him whose Dhruva, is made of Vikankata, wood finds rest; verily he is propagated. That is the form of the offering-spoons; on him whose spoons are so formed all forms of cattle attend, nothing unshapely is born in him.</P>

<H3>iii. 5. 9.</H3>
<P>To that deity whom the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer overlook do they fall victims; he should draw the cup of curd for Prajapati, all the gods are Prajapati; verily they make reparation to the gods. This is the foremost of cups; verily he for whom it is drawn attains a foremost place. This cup is the form of all the deities; on him for whom it is drawn all forms of cattle attend. 'Thou are taken with a support [1]; for Prajapati thee, for him full of light, (thee) full of light I take', he says; verily he makes him a light of his equals. 'For those whose tongue is Agni, who are righteous', he says; so many are the deities; verily for all of them he draws it. 'Smite away, O Indra, the mind of him who hateth us', he says, for the smiting away of foes. 'For expiration thee, for inspiration thee', he says; verily he bestows the breaths on the sacrificer. 'For that thee, for Prajapati, of bounteous gifts, full of light, (thee) full of light I offer' [2], he says; all the deities are Prajapati; verily for all the deities he offers it. He should draw the cup of butter for one who desires brilliance; butter is brilliance; verily he becomes brilliant; he should draw the cup of Soma for one who desires splendour; Soma is splendour; verily he becomes resplendent; he should draw the cup of curd for one who desires cattle; curd is strength, cattle are strength; verily by strength he wins him strength and cattle.</P>

<P>He draws the Prana, cups; so much is there as are these cups, these Stomas, these metres, these Prstha (Stotras), these quarters; whatever there is [1] that he wins. The highest Brahmans have proclaimed these before; they have therefore won all the quarters. He for whom these are drawn attains supremacy, he conquers the quarters. Five are drawn, the quarters are five; verily they prosper in all the quarters. Nine each are drawn; nine are the vital airs in man; verily upon the sacrificers he bestows the vital airs. At the beginning and at the end they are drawn; the Prana cups are the vital airs [2]; verily they begin with the vital airs, and end with the vital airs. Now offspring leave their vital airs in that the Vamadevya (Saman) departs from its norm; on the tenth day the Vamadevya departs from its norm; in that they are drawn on the tenth day, offspring leave not their vital airs.</P>
