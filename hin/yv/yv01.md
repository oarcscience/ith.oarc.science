### i. 1. 13.

a With the impulse of strength,  
With elevation he hath lifted me up;

What is elevation and depression;  
Then do ye, O Indra and Agni,  
Scatter my foes on every side.  
c To the Vasus thee, to the Rudras thee, to the Adityas thee!

m The fence which thou didst put round thee  
When thou wast beset by the Panis, O god Agni,  
That do I bring here to thee that thou mayst rejoice in it,  
That it be not removed from thee.  
n Go ye two to the place of the gods.  
o Ye are sharers in the remains (of the oblation), well nourished,
mighty  
Ye gods that are on the *prastara* and sit on the strew \[2\].  
Accepting this supplication, do ye all,  
Seated on this strew enjoy yourselves.  
p I set thee in the seat of Agni whose abode is secure.  
q For goodwill, O ye two with goodwill, place me in goodwill.  
r Guard ye the yoke-horses at the yoke.  
s O Agni, with life unhurt, with not-cool body, guard me this day from
the sky, guard from bondage, guard from error in sacrifice, guard from
evil food, guard from ill deed.  
t Make our food free from poison, the lap pleasant to sit in; hail!  
u O ye gods that know the way, knowing the way, go ye the way.  
v O lord of mind, this sacrifice for us place among the gods, O god,  
hail! in speech, hail! in the wind, hail!

### i. 1. 14.

a Ye twain shall be summoned, O Indra and Agni.  
Ye twain shall rejoice together in the offering.  
You both givers of food and riches,  
You both I summon for the winning of strength.  
b For I have heard that ye both are more generous  
Than a worthless son-in-law or a wife's brother.  
So with the offering of Soma I make for you,  
O 1ndra and Agni, a new hymn of praise;  
c O Indra and Agni, ninety forts  
Of which the Dasas were lords ye overtbrew  
Together in one deed.  
d This pure new-born hymn of praise this day,  
O Indra and Agni, slayers of Vrtra, accept with joy \[1\].  
For on you both I call that are ready to listen,  
You that are ever readiest to give strength to the eager.  
e We thee, O lord of the path,  
As a chariot to win the prize,  
Have yoked for our prayer, O Pusan.  
f Lord of each way with eloquence;  
Driven by love he went to Arka;  
May he give us the comfort of gold,  
May Pusan further our every prayer.  
g By the lord of the field  
As by a friend may we win  
What nourishes our kine and horses;  
May he be \[2\] favourable to such as we are.  
h O lord of the field, the honey-bearing wave,  
As a cow milk, so for us milk;  
May the lords of right graciously accord us  
That which drops honey and is well purified like ghee.  
i O Agni, lead us by a fair path to wealth,  
O god, knowing all the ways;  
Keep away from us the sin that makes us wander;  
We will accord to thee most abundant honour.  
k We have come to the path of the gods  
To accomplish that which we have power to do;  
Let wise Agni sacrifice \[3\], let him be Hotr  
Let him arrange the offerings him the seasons.  
l What carrieth best is for Agni;  
Sing aloud, O thou of brilliant radiance.  
From thee wealth, like a cow,  
From thee strength riseth forth.  
m O Agni, once more lead us  
With thy favour over every trouble.  
Be a broad, thick, wide fortress for us,  
Health and wealth for our children and descendants.  
Thou, O Agni, art the guardian of law,  
Among the gods and mortals;  
Thou art to be invoked at the sacrifices.  
o If laws of you wise ones, O gods,  
In our ignorance we transgress,  
May Agni make good all that,  
He that knoweth the seasons wherein he may satisfy the gods.

s Let the roarings of Agni rise to the heaven,  
Sharp weapons to slay the Raksas;  
In the carouse his radiance bursteth forth  
The godless assailers cannot restrain him.

Who feedeth on bull and cow,  
The disposer, backed with Soma.  
w For thou art, O son, a singer, seated at the feast;  
Agni made at birth a path and food;  
Do thou, O giver of strength, bestow strength upon us;  
Be victorious like a king; thou rulest within without a foe.  
x O Agni, thou purifiest life \[7\];  
Do thou give food and strength to us;  
Far away drive ill-fortune.  
y O Agni, good worker, purify for us  
Glory in good heroes;  
Giving increase and wealth to me.  
z O Agni the purifying, with thy light,  
0 god, with thy pleasant tongue,  
Bring hither the gods and sacrifice.  
aa Do thou, O shining and purifying one,  
O Agni, bring hither the gods  
To our sacrifice and our oblation.  
bb Agni, of purest vows,  
Pure sage, pure poet,  
Shineth in purity, when offering is made.  
cc O Agni, thy pure,  
Bright, flaming (rays) arise,  
Thy lights, thy flames.

## PRAPATHAKA V

The Rekindling of the Fire

### i. 5. 1.

The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods, in anticipation of
the contest, deposited in Agni their desirable riches (thinking),'This
will still be ours, if they defeat us. Agni desired it and went away
with it. The gods having defeated (the Asuras) pursued (Agni) desirous
of recovering it. They sought violently to take it from him. He wept; in
that he wept (*arodit*), that is why Rudra has his name. The tear that
\[1\] was shed became silver; therefore silver is not a suitable gift,
for it is born of tears. He who gives on the strew, in his house before
the year is out they weep; therefore one should not give on the strew.
Agni said, 'Let me have a share; then this will be yours.' They replied,
'The re-establishing shall be thine alone.' 'He shall prosper', he said,
who shall establish the fire with me as its divinity.' Pusan established
it; therefore \[2\] did Pusan prosper; therefore cattle are said to be
Pusan's. Tvastr established it; therefore did Tvastr prosper; therefore
cattle are said to be Tvastr's. Manu established it; therefore did Manu
prosper; therefore offspring are said to be Manu's. Dhatr established
it; therefore Dhatr prospered; Dhatr is the year; therefore offspring
and cattle are born in the course of the year. He who knows thus the
prosperity of the re-establishing \[3\] prospers. He who knows his
connexions becomes possessed of connexions himself. Agni desiring a
share after being established assailed the offspring and cattle of the
sacrifice. Having removed it, one should re-establish it; thus he unites
him with his own portion; verily he is appeased. He should establish
under Punarvasu; Punarvasu is the Naksatra for the re-establishing;
verily by establishing it under its own deity he becomes resplendent. He
establishes with Darbha grass, for variety. He establishes with Darbha;
verily winning it from the waters and the plants he establishes it. The
sacrificial cake is offered on five potsherds; the seasons are five;
verily he wins it from the seasons and establishes it.

### i. 5. 2.

He who removes the fire casts away the sacrifice and cattle. The
sacrificial cake is offered on five potsherds; the sacrifice is
fivefold, cattle are fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice and cattle.
Now he who removes the fire is the slayer of the hero among the gods;
Brahmans desirous of holiness did not aforetime eat his food; the Yajyas
and Anuvakyas are in the Pankti metre; the sacrifice is fivefold, man is
fivefold; verily making recompense to the gods for the hero he
re-establishes the fire \[1\]. They are of a hundred syllables; man
lives a hundred years and has a hundred powers; verily he rests on life
and power. In that Agni when established does not prosper, (it is that
he is) desiring a greater portion; in that it is all Agni's, that is his
prosperity. Speech is uttered together in the house of him who removes
the fire; the sacrificer is liable to perish on account of the uttering
together of speech. There are discriminations, to sever speech and
preserve the sacrificer \[2\]. He makes a discrimination; verily he
makes the holy power (Brahman). He speaks the Yajus, muttering; it is as
if one who has found a rich treasure hides it. To Agni Svistakrt he
speaks aloud; it is as if one who has found a rich treasure is fain to
go openly. Uttering the discrimination he makes the Vasat cry with the
foresacrifice; verily he leaves not his abode. The sacrificial cake is
the sacrificer, the oblations are cattle; in that he offers these
libations on either side of the cake \[3\], he thus surrounds the
sacrificer on either side with cattle. 'After performing the Yajus and
collecting the apparatus', they say: 'the apparatus should not be
collected, the Yajus should not be performed,' they say: the apparatus
should be collected and the Yajus performed, for the prosperity of the
sacrifice. The sacrificial fee is a renovated chariot, a newly-sewn
garment, a draught ox let loose again, for the prosperity of the
re-establishing. 'Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, seven thy
tongues'; (with these words) he offers the Agnihotra. Wherever there is
anything of his nature, thence \[4\] does he win him. Now he who removes
the fire is the slayer of the hero among the gods, Varuna is the exactor
of the recompense; he should make an offering on eleven potsherds to
Agni and Varuna; him whom he slays and him who exacts the recompense he
delights with their own portion; the sacrificer is not ruined.

b The spotted bull hath come  
And reached again the mother  
And the father, faring to the heaven.  
c Thirty places be ruleth;  
Speech resorteth to the bird  
Bear it with the days.  
d With her inspiration from his expiration,  
She wandereth between the worlds;  
The bull discerneth the heaven.  
e If thee \[1\] in anger I have scattered,  
In rage or through misfortune,

Again thee we relight.

Was spread over the earth,  
That the Adityas, the All-gods

Seven birthplaces with ghee do thou fill.  
i Return with strength, return,  
O Agni, with food and life;  
Again guard us on all sides.  
k Return with wealth, O Agni,

partake of our oblation.

'Earth in depth, sky in breadth,' he says; with this benediction he
establishes it. The serpents thought that they were growing worn out;
Kasarnira Kadraveya beheld this Mantra; then did they strike off their
worn-out skins. With the verses of the queen of serpents he establishes
the Garhapatya, and so renewing it he establishes it as immortal. Pure
food did not come to the earth; she \[1\] beheld this Mantra; then food
came to her. In that he establishes the Garhapatya with the verses of
the serpent queen (it serves) for the winning of food; verily he
establishes it firm in the (earth). 'If thee in anger I have scattered',
he says; verily he conceals it from him. 'Again thee we relight', he
says; verily he kindles him all together. 'Whatever of thee scattered in
rage', he says; verily by means of the deities \[2\] he unites him. The
sacrifice of him who removes the fire is split; he pays reverence with a
verse containing the word Brhaspati; Brhaspati is the holy power
(Brahman) of the gods; verily by holy power (Brahman) he unites the
sacrifice. 'May he unite this scattered sacrifice', he says, for
continuity, 'May the All-gods rejoice herein', he says; verily
continuing the sacrifice he points it out to the gods. 'Seven are thy
kindling-sticks, O Agni, seven thy tongues' \[3\], he says, for
sevenfold in seven-wise are the dear forms of Agni; verily he wins them.
'Return with strength', 'Return with wealth', (with these words) he
offers oblations on either side of the sacrificial cake; verily with
strength and with wealth he surrounds on either side the sacrificer. The
Adityas went from this world to yonder world, they were thirsty in
yonder world, having returned to this world and having established the
fire, they offered these oblations; they prospered, they went to the
world of heaven. He, who establishes a fire after the second
establishment, should offer these oblations; be prospers with the
prosperity where with the Adityas prospered.

The Reverence of the Fire

### i. 5. 5.

a As we approach the sacrifice,  
Let us utter a hymn to Agni,  
Who heareth us, even from afar.  
b After his ancient splendour,  
The bold ones have drawn the white milk  
From the seer who winneth a thousand.  
c Agni is the head of the sky, the height,  
Lord of the earth here,  
He quickeneth the seed of the waters.  
d Here hath he first been established by the establishers,  
Youngest Hotr to be invoked at the sacrifices,  
Whom Apnavana and the Bhrgus caused to shine,  
Bright in the woods, spreading from house to house.  
e Ye twain shall be summoned, O Indra and Agni \[1\],  
Ye twain shall rejoice together in the offering  
You both, givers of food and riches,  
You both I summon for the winning of strength.  
f This is thy due place of birth,  
Whence born thou didst shine;  
Mount it, O Agni, knowing it,  
And make our wealth increase.  
g O Agni, thou purifiest life;  
Do thou give food and strength to us;  
Far away drive ill-fortune.  
h O Agni, good worker, purify for us  
Glory in good heroes,  
Giving increase of wealth \[2\] to me.  
i O Agni, the purifying, with thy light,  
O god, with thy pleasant tongue,  
Bring hither the gods and sacrifice.  
k Do thou, O shining and purifying one,  
O Agni, bring hither the gods  
To our sacrifice and our oblation.  
l Agni, of purest vows,  
Pure sage, pure poet,  
Shineth in purity when offering is made.  
m O Agni, thy pure,  
Bright, flaming (rays) arise,  
Thy lights, thy flames.  
n Thou art giver of life, O Agni; give me life \[3\]. Thou art giver of
radiance, O Agni; give me radiance. Thou art guardian of the body, O
Agni; guard my body.  
o O Agni, whatever is deficient in my body, do thou make that good for
me.  
p O thou of various splendour, in safety may I reach the end of thee.  
q Kindling thee may we kindle thee for a hundred winters, in radiance,
strong the giver of strength, famous the giver of fame, with good
heroes, the undeceived, O Agni, the deceiver of foes in the highest
firmament.  
r Thou, O Agni, hast attained the radiance of the sun, the praises of
the Rsis, thy beloved abode.  
s Thou, O Agni, hast the radiance of the sun; grant me life, radiance,
and offspring.

### i. 5. 6.

a I gaze on offspring,  
Offspring of Ida, connected with Manu;  
May they all be in our house.  
b Ye are water; may I share your water. Ye are greatness, may I share
your greatness; ye are might, may I share your might; ye are strength,
may I share your strength.  
c Ye wealthy ones, stay in this place, this fold, this dwelling, this
birthplace; be ye here; go not hence; be many for me \[1\].  
d Thou art composed of every form; enter me with strength, with lordship
of kine, with increase of wealth.  
e May I prosper with your thousandfold prosperity; may your wealth rest
in me.  
f To thee, O Agni, day by day,  
That shinest in the darkness, with our devotion,  
We come bearing honour.  
g Lord of the sacrifices,  
Guardian of holy order, shining,  
Waxing in his own horne.  
h O Agni, be of easy access to us,  
As a father to his son;  
Befriend us for prosperity.  
i O Agni \[2\] be thou our nearest,  
Our protector, kindly, a shield;  
Thee, O shining and most radiant one,  
We implore for favour, for our friends;  
Agni, bright, of bright fame,  
Come hither in thy greatest splendour and give us wealth.  
k With strength I gaze on you; gaze on me with strength. With increase
of wealth I gaze on you; gaze on me with increase of wealth.  
l Ye are food, making sweetness; kindly enter me, nourishment and drink;
may I prosper with your thousandfold prosperity \[3\], may your wealth
rest on me,  
m That excellent glory of Savitr  
The god we meditate,  
That be may stimulate our prayers.'  
n Make famous the Soma-presser,  
O lord of prayer,  
Even as (thou did make famous) Kaksivant Auçija.  
o Never art thou barren, O Indra,  
Never dost thou fail thy worshipper;  
Now more and more is thy divine gift increased,  
O bountiful one.  
p May we set thee around us, O Agni,  
The sage, the strong, as a fort,  
Of daring hue, day by day  
Destroyer of that which may be broken.  
q O Agni, lord of the house, through thee as lord of the house, may I be
a good lord of the house; through me as lord of the house, mayst thou be
a good lord of the house; for a hundred winters, this blessing I invoke,
bringing light for the race; this blessing I invoke, bringing light for
N. N.

### i. 5. 7.

There is no sacrifice without a Saman. 'As we approach the sacrifice',
he says; verily he yokes a Stoma with it. 'Approach', he says; offspring
and cattle approach the world; verily he approaches cattle and offspring
and this world. 'After his ancient splendour', he says; the ancient is
the world of heaven; verily he mounts upon the world of heaven. 'Agni is
the head of the sky, the height', he says; verily he makes him the head
\[1\] of his equals, and verily from the world of the gods he rests in
the world of men. 'Here hath he first been established by the
establishers', he says; verily he makes him the principal. 'Ye twain
shall be summoned, O Indra and Agni', he says; verily he wins might and
force. 'This is thy due place of birth', he says; wealth is cattle;
verily he wins cattle. With six (verses) he pays reverence; the seasons
are six \[2\]; verily he rests on the seasons. With six subsequent
(verses) he pays reverence; they make up twelve; the year has twelve
months; verily he rests on the year. Just as a man, a horse, a cow, are
worn out, so the fire when established wears out; at the end of the year
he pays reverence with (verses) containing the words Agni and *pu*;
verily he renews it and makes it unageing, and also purifies it. He pays
reverence; that is his union. He pays reverence \[3\]; that is his bond.
He pays reverence; that is his appeal. He pays reverence; that is as if
an inferior brings (something) to a superior and pays him honour. 'Thou
art giver of life, O Agni; give me life', he says, for he is a giver of
life. 'Thou art giver of radiance, O Agni; give me radiance', he says,
for he is a giver of radiance. I Thou art guardian of the body, O Agni;
guard my body', he says \[4\], for he is a guardian of the body. 'O
Agni, whatever is deficient in my body, do thou make that good for me',
he says; 'whatever is deficient in my offspring and cattle, do thou make
that good for me', be says in effect. 'O thou of various splendour, in
safety may I reach the end of thee', he says; that of various splendour
is the night. The Brahmans aforetime feared its not dawning; verily he
wins the dawn. 'Kindling thee for a hundred winters' \[5\], he says; man
lives a hundred years and has a hundred powers; verily he rests on life
and power. This is a pipe with projections; by it the gods made
piercings of hundreds of the Asuras; in that he takes up the
kindling-stick with this verse, the sacrificer hurls the hundred-slaying
(verse) as a bolt against his enemy to lay (him) low without fail.
'Thou, O Agni, hast attained the radiance of the sun', he says; 'that
thou art, thus may I be', he says in effect. 'Thou, O Agni, hast the
radiance of the sun', he says; verily he invokes this blessing.

### i. 5. 8.

'I gaze on offspring', he says; verily he wins all the domesticated
animals. 'Ye are water; may I share your water', he says, for they are
water. 'Ye are greatness; may I share your greatness', he says, for they
are greatness. 'Ye are might; may I share your might', he says, for they
are might. 'Ye are strength; may I share your strength', he says \[1\],
for they are strength. 'Ye wealthy ones, stay', he says; the wealthy
ones are cattle; verily he makes cattle stay with himself. 'Be ye here;
go not hence', he says; verily he makes them constant, departing not.
Now one fire is piled with bricks, one with cattle. 'Thou art composed
Of every form', (with these words) he strokes the calf; verily he piles
it up and makes it piled with cattle. He falls away \[2\] from this
world who pays reverence to the Ahavaniya; he pays reverence to the
Garhapatya; verily he rests on this world, and also he makes amends to
the Garhapatya. He pays reverence with Gayatri verses; the Gayatri is
brilliance; verily he confers brilliance upon himself; moreover in that
he repeats the triad (of verses), (it serves) for continuity. Because of
the Garhapatya men are born with two feet; to him who knowing thus pays
reverence to the Garhapatya with (verses) of two feet \[3\], a hero son
is born. 'With strength I gaze upon you; gaze on me with strength', he
says; verily he invokes this blessing. 'That excellent glory of Savitr',
he says, for instigation. 'Famous the Soma-presser', he says; verily he
wins the Soma draught. 'Make, O lord of prayer', he says; verily he wins
splendour. 'Never art thou barren', be says; no barren night does he
pass \[4\], who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire. May we (set)
thee around, O Agni, as a fort', he says; verily he sets around a
barrier, that nothing be spilt. 'O Agni, lord of the house', he says;
that is according to the text. 'For a hundred winters', he says; 'for a
hundred winters may I kindle thee', he says in effect. He utters the
name of his son; verily he makes him an eater of food. 'This blessing I
invoke bringing light for the race', he should say, who has no son born;
verily is born to him a son brilliant and resplendent. 'This blessing I
invoke bringing light for N. N.', he should say who has a son born;
verily he confers upon him brilliance and splendour.

### i. 5. 9.

He offers the Agnihotra; whatever there is. of the Sacrificer's own,
that is (still) his. In the generative organ he pours seed, for Agni is
the generative organ. Then he burns at the end the plants; they then
grow more numerous. In that he offers in the evening, he thus pours
seed, and makes it productive by the morning (offering). Seed when
poured does not prove fruitful unless modified by Tvastr; as many
modifications of seed when poured \[1\] as Tvastr makes, in so many
shapes does it become fruitful; the sacrificer is the divine Tvastr. He
pays reverence with many (verses); verily he makes many modifications of
the seed when poured. He is fruitful and day by day becomes greater, who
knowing thus pays reverence to the fire. The day was the gods', the
night the Asuras'. The Asuras entered night with all the precious wealth
of the gods \[2\]; the gods thought that they were abandoned; they
perceived, 'The night is Agni's, cattle are Agni's; verily let us praise
Agni here; he being praised by us will restore our cattle.' They praised
Agni; be praised by them delivered their cattle from night to day; the
gods having gained their cattle per formed their desires. He who knowing
thus pays reverence to the fire becomes possessed of cattle \[3\]. The
sun went from this world to yonder world; he having gone to yonder world
bethought him again of this world; having returned to this world he had
fear of death, for this world is, as it were, yoked with death. He
reflected, 'Let me praise Agni here; he, praised, will make me go to the
world of heaven.' He praised Agni; he, praised, made him go to the world
of heaven. He who \[4\] knowing thus pays reverence to the fire, goes to
the world of heaven and lives all his days. He mounts these two fires
who pays reverence to them; he acts according to the desires of one who
has attained a higher place. He pays reverence at night, not in the
morning, for vows are mingled at night, the bad and the good are on the
same level, the fire is the light, the evening is the darkness; in that
\[5\] he pays reverence by night, he overcomes the darkness by light.
'Should reverence be paid to the fire or not?' they say; 'he who day by
day makes a present to a man and then begs of him assuredly molests him;
and who then will day by day beg of the gods?' Then they say, 'The
sacrificer sacrifices for the sake of the benediction.' The reverence of
the fire is \[6\] the benediction of him who has established a fire;
therefore reverence should be paid to the fire. Prajapati created
cattle; being created they entered day and night; he recovered them by
means of the metres. In that he pays reverence with the metres, he seeks
to recover his own. 'There is not monotony then', they say, 'if one pays
reverence day by day.' If a man pays reverence to the fire facing it, it
burns him; if with averted (face), he is deprived of offspring and
cattle; he should pay reverence with (face) somewhat to the side, then
(the fire) does not burn him, he is not deprived of offspring or cattle.

### i. 5. 10.

a The name that first, O alI-knower,  
My father and my mother bestowed upon me aforetime,  
Do thou bear it until I return;  
O Agni, may I bear thy name.  
b My name and thine, O all-knower,  
Which like men changing garments we bear,  
Let us exchange again,  
Thou for life, and we to live.  
c Homage to Agni, the unpierced,  
Homage to the unapproachable, homage to the king!  
Irresistible is Agni \[1\], the very vigorous, all-conquering,  
Powerful, the best, the Gandharva.  
d O Agni, the gods have thee for father,  
Offer to thee oblations, and have thee as an umpire  
With life, with lordship of cattle (endow) me  
And bestow on me good fortune.  
e Agni here is of all the best,  
He is most adorable,  
Must ready to win (us) a thousand;  
To him be all good strength.  
f Mind, light, rejoice in the oblation  
May he unite the scattered sacrifice;  
The offerings at dawn and evening  
I unite with oblation and ghee.  
g Rich in milk are the plants \[2\],  
The milk of the shoot is rich in milk,  
With the milk of the milk of the waters,  
O Indra, do thou unite me.  
h O Agni, lord of vows, I shall perform this vow; may I accomplish it;
may it be successful for me.  
i Agni, the priest, I summon hither;  
The gods worthy of sacrifice whom we invoke,  
Let these gods come in kindly mind;  
Let the gods enjoy this oblation of me.  
k Who yoketh thee? Let him yoke thee.  
l The potsherds for the cauldron \[3\],  
Which wise men collect,  
These are in Pusan's guardianship;  
Indra and Vayu set them free.  
m Unbroken is the cauldron, sprinkling abundantly,  
It hath returned to that whence it came;  
The kindling-wood, the Vedi, and all the enclosing-sticks  
Attend the life of the sacrifice.  
n The three and thirty threads that stretch,  
That maintain in security the sacrifice,  
Of these the broken one I restore; hail!  
Let the cauldron go to the gods.

### i. 5. 11.

a Let Vaiçvanara with succour for us  
Come from afar,  
Agni through the hymn which brings (him).  
b The righteous Vaiçvanara,  
Lord of right and of light,  
The immortal cauldron we seek.'  
c A greater than the marvels of Vaiçvanara  
By his craftsmanship the sage hath performed alone;  
Magnifying both parents, sky and earth,  
Rich in seed, was Agni born.  
d Desired in the sky, Agni, desired on earth,  
Desired he entereth all the plants;  
Agni Vaiçvanara eagerly desired,  
May he by day \[1\] and night protect us from the foe.  
e In that, when born, O Agni, thou didst survey the worlds,  
Like a busy herd that goeth around his flock,  
Do thou, O Vaiçvanara, find a way for the Brahman;  
Do ye protect us ever with your blessings.  
f Thou, O Agni, blazing with light,  
Didst fill the firmament at thy birth;  
Thou, O Vaiçvanara, wise one, by thy might  
Didst free the gods from misfortune.'  
g O Agni, among our bountiful lords, preserve  
The lordship, uninjured, unageing, rich in heroes;  
May we win booty a hundred, a thousandfold,  
O Vaiçvanara \[2\], O Agni, through thy help.  
h May we enjoy the loving kindness of Vaiçvanara,  
For he is the king, the orderer of the worlds  
Hence born be discerneth all the (earth),  
Vaiçvanara vieth with the sun.  
i Thine anger, O Varuna, would we avert with reverence,  
With sacrifices, with oblations  
Ruling, O wise Asura, O king,  
Do thou unloose the sins we have committed.  
k Unloose from us, O Varuna, the highest,  
The lowest, the midmost knot;  
Then may we, O Aditya \[3\], in thy rule,  
Be guiltless before Aditi.  
I Of Dadhikravan have I sung,  
The swift strong horse;  
May he make our mouths fragrant;  
May he lengthen our days.  
m Dadhikra with his glory hath overspread the five peoples,  
As the sun with his light the waters;  
May the strong steed, winning a hundred, a thousand,  
Fill with boney these words of ours.  
n Agni, the head.  
o Thou art.  
p O Maruts, what time seeking your favour  
We call on you from the sky,  
Do ye come unto us \[4\].  
q The protections which ye have for the earnest worshipper,  
Threefold do ye grant them to the generous giver,  
To us, O Maruts, do ye accord them;  
O strong ones, give us wealth rich in heroes:  
r Let Aditi save us,  
Let Aditi give us protection,  
Let Aditi guard us from tribulation.  
s The mighty mother of the righteous,  
The spouse of holy order, let us invoke to aid us,  
The powerful, the unageing, the wide  
Aditi, who giveth good protection and good guidance.  
t Earth strong to save, sky unrivalled,  
Aditi who giveth good protection and good guidance,  
The divine ship with good oars, the blameless,  
Which leaketh not, let us mount for prosperity.  
u Happily have I mounted this ship  
With a hundred oars and a hundred spars,  
Without leak, able to convey across.

n The gods have increased my prayer  
Which is elevation and depression;  
Then do ye, O Indra and Agni,  
Scatter my foes on every side.  
o Hither these blessings have come, fain for milking,  
Possessing Indra \[2\], may we win,  
May we milk offspring and food.  
p With the red steed may Agni convey thee to the god; with the tawny
ones may Indra convey thee to the god; with Etaça may Sarya convey thee
to the god.  
q I unyoke thy head ropes, thy reins,  
Thy yokings, thy harness;  
Bestow upon us wealth and what is good;  
Proclaim us sharers among the gods.  
r By sacrifice to the god Visnu, by the sacrifice, may I attain health
and wealth, and security.  
s By sacrifice to the god Soma \[3\], possessing good seed, may I
impregnate seed.  
t By sacrifice to the god Tvastr, may I prosper the form of cattle.  
u The wives of the gods, Agni lord of the house, are the pair of the
sacrifice; by sacrifice to these deities, may I be propagated with a
pair.  
v Thou art the bundle, thou art gain, may I gain.  
w Thou art action, thou art making, may I make.  
x Thou art winning, thou art the winner, may I win.  
y May the bundle bestow increase of wealth,  
Rich in ghee, rich in houses,  
A thousandfold, strong.

a Let the Dhruva swell with ghee,  
For each sacrifice for the worshippers;  
In the udder of the sun maiden, in the lap of Aditi,  
Broad streamed be the earth at this sacrifice.  
b Prajapati's is the world called Vibhan. In it I place thee along with
the sacrificer.  
c Thou art real, be real for me; thou art all, be all for me; thou art
full, be full for me; thou art imperishable, perish not for me.  
d In the eastern quarter may the gods, the priests, make (me) bright; in
the southern \[1\] quarter may the months, the fathers, make (me)
bright; in the western quarter may the houses, the cattle, make (me)
bright; in the northern quarter may the waters, the plants, the trees
make (me) bright; in the zenith may the sacrifice, the year, the lord of
the sacrifice make (me) bright.  
e Thou art the step of Visnu, smiting enmity; with the Gayatri metre I
step across the earth; excluded is he whom we hate.  
f Thou art the step of Visnu, smiting imprecations; with the Tristubh
metre I step across the atmosphere; excluded is he whom we hate.  
g Thou art the step of Visnu, smiter of him who practiseth evil; with
the Jagati metre I step across the sky; excluded is he whom we hate.  
h Thou art the step of Visnu, smiter of the hostile one; with the
Anustubh metre I stop across the quarters; excluded is he whom we hate.

### i. 6. 6.

a We have come to the heaven; to the heaven we have come.  
b May I not be cut off from seeing thee; what heat is thine, to that of
thee may I not be brought low.  
c Thou art good, the best of rays, thou art life-bestowing, bestow
life  
upon me; thou art radiance-bestowing, bestow radiance upon me.  
d Here do I exclude my enemy, N. N., from these quarters, this sky, this
atmosphere, this earth, this food. Excluded is he whom we hate \[1\].  
e I have been united with the light.  
f I turn the turning of Indra.  
g May I be united with offspring, offspring with me.  
h May I be united with increase of wealth, increase of wealth with me.  
i Kindled, O Agni, shine for me; kindling thee, O Agni, may I shine.  
k Be rich the sacrifice; may I be rich.  
1 O Agni, thou purifiest life;  
Do thou give food and strength to us;  
Far away drive ill-fortune.  
m O Agni, good worker, purify for us  
Glory in good heroes \[2\],  
Giving increase and wealth to me.  
n O Agni, lord of the house, through thee as lord of the house, may I be
a good lord of the house; through me as lord of the house, mayst thou be
a good lord of the house; for a hundred winters; this blessing I invoke
bringing light for the race; this blessing I invoke bringiug light for
N. N.  
o Who yoketh thee? Let him set thee free.  
p O Agni, lord of vows, I have performed my vow; for that I have had
strength; that hath been accomplished by me.  
q The sacrifice hath become, it hath \[3\] come into being,  
It hath been born, it hath waxed great;  
It hath become the overlord of the gods,  
May it make us overlords,  
May we be lords of wealth.  
r Rich in cattle, in sheep, O Agni, in horses, is the sacrifice,  
With manly companions, ever unalterable;  
Rich in food is this, O Asura, rich in offspring,  
Enduring wealth, deep based and rich in houses.

### i. 6. 7.

Even as the Soma (sacrifices) come together in competition, so the new
and full moon (sacrifices) are sacrifices which come together in
competition. Whose sacrifice then do the gods approach and whose not?
He, who among many sacrificers first appropriates the gods, sacrifices
to them when the next day comes. The Ahavaniya is the abode of the gods,
between the fires of cattle, the Garhapatya of men, the Anvaharya pacana
of the fathers. He takes the fire; verily he appropriates \[1\] the gods
in their own abode; to them he sacrifices when the next day comes. By
means of a vow is Agni, lord of vows, pure, the Brahman is a supporter
of vows. When about to undertake a vow he should say, 'O Agni, lord of
vows, I shall perform the vow.' Agni is the lord of vows among the gods;
verily after announcement to him he undertakes the vow. At the full moon
be undertakes his vow with the (strewing of the) straw, with the
(driving away of the) calves at new moon; for that is their abode. 'The
fires, both in the front and at the back, must be bestrewed', they say;
men \[2\] indeed desire what is bestrewed, and, how much more the gods
whose is a new dwelling. With him, when sacrifice is to be made on the
next day, do the gods dwell, who knowing this bestrews the fire. 'The
sacrificer should win both beasts of the wild and of the village', they
say; in that he refrains from those of the village, thereby be wins
them; in that he eats of the wild, thereby he wins them of the wild. If
be were to fast without eating, the Pitrs would be his divinity \[3\];
he eats of the wild, the wild is power, and so he bestows power upon
himself. If he were to fast without eating, he would be hungry; if he
were to eat, Rudra would plan evil against his cattle; he partakes of
water; that is neither eaten nor not eaten; he is not hungry and Rudra
does not plot evil against his cattle. The sacrificer is a bolt, the
enemy of man is hunger; in that he fasts without eating, he straightway
smites with the bolt the enemy, hunger.

### i. 6. 8.

He who offers sacrifice without faith, they place not faith in his
sacrifice. He brings waters forward, the waters are faith; verily with
faith he offers sacrifice, and both gods and men place faith in his
sacrifice. They say, 'They foam over the barrier, they foam over speech,
but over mind they do not foam.' He brings them forward with mind; mind
is this (earth) \[1\]; verily with this (earth) he brings them forward.
The sacrifice of him who knows thus does not spill. He collects the
weapons of the sacrifice; the weapons of the sacrifice are the
sacrifice; verily he collects the sacrifice. If he were to collect them
one by one, they would have the Pitrs as their divinity; if all
together, (they would have) men as their divinity. He collects them in
pairs, and so he makes the form of the Yajya and the Anuvakya, and thus
there is a pair. If a man knows the ten weapons of the sacrifice, his
sacrifice is in order at the beginning. The wooden sword \[2\], the
potsherds, the offering-spoon, the basket, the black antelope skin, the
pin, the mortar and pestle, the lower and upper millstones, these are
the ten weapons of the sacrifice; the sacrifice of him who knows thus is
in order at the beginning. If a man sacrifices after announcing the
sacrifice to the gods, they delight in his sacrifice. He should as the
oblation is being offered recite (the words), 'Agni, the priest, him I
summon hither' \[3\]. Thus he announces the sacrifice to the gods and
sacrifices, and the gods delight in his sacrifice. This is the taking of
the sacrifice and so after taking the sacrifice he sacrifices. After
speaking he remains silent, to support the sacrifice. Now Prajapati
performed the sacrifice with mind; verily he performs the sacrifice with
mind to prevent the Raksases following. He who yokes the sacrifice when
the yoking (time) arrives yokes it indeed among the yokers. 'Who (*ka*)
yoketh thee? Let him yoke thee', he says. *Ka* is Prajapati--verily by
Prajapati he yokes it; he yokes indeed among the yokers.

### i. 6. 9.

Prajapati created the sacrifices, the Agnihotra, the Agnistoma, the full
moon sacrifice, the Ukthya, the new moon sacrifice and the Atiratra.
These he meted out; the Agnistoma was the size of the Agnihotra, the
Ukthya that of the full moon sacrifice, the Atiratra that of the new
moon sacrifice. He who knowing thus offers the Agnihotra obtains as much
as by offering the Agnistoma; he who knowing thus offers the full moon
sacrifice obtains as much as by offering the Ukthya \[1\]; he who
knowing thus offers the new moon sacrifice obtains as much as by
offering the Atiratra. This sacrifice was in the beginning
Paramesthin's, and by means of it he reached the supreme goal. He
furnished Prajapati with it, and by means of it Prajapati reached the
supreme goal. He furnished Indra with it, and by means of it Indra
reached the supreme goal. He furnished Agni and Soma with it, and by
means of it Agni and Soma reached the supreme goal. He who \[2\] knowing
thus offers the new and full moon sacrifices reaches the supreme goal.
He who sacrifices with an abundant offering is multiplied with
offspring, with cattle, with pairings. 'The year has twelve months,
there are twelve pairs of new and full moon sacrifices; these are to be
produced', they say. He lets the calf go free and puts the pot on the
fire: he puts down (the rice), and beats the millstones together; he
scatters (the grains) and collects the potsherds; the cake \[3\] he puts
on the fire and the melted butter; he throws the clump of grass, and
gathers it in; he surrounds the Vedi and he girds the wife (of the
sacrificer); he puts in place the anointing waters and the melted
butter. These are the twelve pairs in the new and full moon sacrifices.
He, who thus sacrifices with these, sacrifices with an abundant offering
and is multiplied with offspring, with cattle, with pairings.

### i. 6. 10.

'Thou I art secure; may I be secure among my equals', he says; verily he
makes them secure.' 'Thou art dread; may I be dread among my equals';
verily he makes them harmonious. 'Thou art overcoming; may I be
overcoming among my equals,' he says; verily he overthrows him who rises
against him. 'I yoke thee with the divine Brahman', he says; this is the
yoking of the fire; verily \[1\] with it he yokes it. With the
prosperous part of the sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven,
with the unsuccessful part they overcame the Asuras. 'Whatever, O Agni,
in this sacrifice of mine may be spoiled', he says; verily with the
prosperous part of the sacrifice the sacrificer goes to the world of
heaven, with the unsuccessful part he overcomes the foes. With these
Vyahrtis he should set down the Agnihotra. The Agnihotra is the
beginning of the sacrifice, these Vyahrtis are the Brahman; verily at
the beginning of the sacrifice he makes the Brahman \[2\]. When the year
is completed he should thus with these (Vyahrtis) perform the setting
down; verily with the Brahman he surrounds the year on both sides. He
who is undertaking the new and full moon and the four monthly offerings
should set in place the oblations with these Vyahrtis. The new and full
moon and the four monthly sacrifices are the beginning of the sacrifice,
these Vyahrtis are the Brahman; verily at the beginning of the sacrifice
he makes the Brahman. When the year is completed, he should thus with
them (Vyahrtis) set down (the oblations), and so with the Brahman he
surrounds the year on both sides. To the kingly class falls the blessing
of the part of the sacrifice which is performed with the Saman \[3\]; to
the people (falls) the blessing of what (is performed) with the Rc; now
the Brahman sacrifices with an offering without a blessing; when he is
about to recite the kindling-verses he should first insert the Vyahrtis;
verily he makes the Brahman the commencement, and thus the Brahman
sacrifices with an offering which has a blessing. If he desire of a
sacrificer, 'May the blessing of his sacrifice fall to his foe', he
should insert for him those Vyahrtis in the Puronuvakya (verse); the
Puronuvakya has the foe for its divinity; verily the blessing of his
sacrifice falls to his foe \[4\]. If he desire of sacrificers, 'May the
blessing of the sacrifice fall to them equally', he should place for
them one of the Vyahrtis at the half-verse of the Puronuvakya, one
before the Yajya, and one at the half-verse of the Yajya, and thus the
blessing of the sacrifice falls to them equally. Even as Parjanya rains
down good rain, so the sacrifice rains for the sacrificer; they surround
the water with a mound, the sacrificer surrounds the sacrifice with a
blessing. 'Thou art mind derived from Prajapati \[5\], with mind and
true existence do thou enter me', he says; mind is derived from
Prajapati, the sacrifice is derived from Prajapati; verily he confers
upon himself mind and the sacrifice. 'Thou art speech, derived from
Indra, destroying the foe; do thou enter me with speech, with power', he
says; speech is derived from Indra; verily he confers upon himself
speech as connected with Indra.

### i. 6. 11.

He who knows the seventeenfold Prajapati as connected with the sacrifice
rests secure through the sacrifice, and falls not away from the
sacrifice. 'Do thou proclaim' has four syllables; 'Be it proclaimed' has
four syllables; 'Utter' has two syllables; 'We that do utter' has five
syllables; the Vasat has two syllables; this is the seventeenfold
Prajapati as connected with the sacrifice; he who knows thus rests
secure through the sacrifice and does not fall away from the sacrifice.
He who knows the beginning, the support, the end of the sacrifice \[1\]
reaches the end with a secure and uninjured sacrifice. 'Do thou
proclaim'; 'Be it proclaimed'; 'Utter'; 'We that do utter'; the Vasat
call, these are the beginning, the support, the end of the sacrifice; he
who knows thus reaches the end with a secure and uninjured sacrifice. He
who knows the milking of the generous one milks her indeed. The generous
one is the sacrifice; (with the words) 'Do thou proclaim', he calls her;
with 'Be it proclaimed' \[2\], he lets (the calf) go up to her; with
'Utter', he raises (the pail); with 'We that do utter', he sits down
beside her, and with the Vasat call he milks. This is the milking of the
generous one; he who knows thus milks her indeed. The gods performed a
sacrificial session; the quarters were dried up; they discerned this
moist set of five; (with the words) 'Do thou proclaim', they produced
the east wind; with 'Be it proclaimed', they caused the clouds to mass
together; with 'Utter' they begat \[3\] the lightning; with 'We that do
sacrifice' they made rain to fall, and with the Vasat call they caused
the thunder to roll. Then for them the quarters were made to swell; for
him who knows thus the quarters are made to swell. One knows Prajapati,
Prajapati knows one; whom Prajapati knows, he becomes pure. This is the
Prajapati of the texts, 'Do thou proclaim', 'Be it proclaimed', 'Utter',
'We that do utter', the Vasat call; he who knows thus becomes pure. 'Of
the seasons spring \[4\] I delight', he says; the fore-sacrifices are
the seasons; verily he delights the seasons; they delighted place
themselves in order for him; the seasons are in order for him who knows
thus. 'By sacrifice to the gods, Agni and Soma, may I be possessed of
sight', he says; the sacrifice is possessed of sight through Agni and
Soma; verily by means of them he confers sight upon himself. 'By
sacrifice to the god Agni, may I be an eater of food', he says; Agni is
among the gods the eater of food; verily by means of him \[5\] he
confers the eating of food upon himself. 'Thou art a deceiver; may I be
undeceived; may I deceive N. N.', he says; by that deceit the gods
deceived the Asuras; verily by this he deceives his foe. 'By sacrifice
to the gods, Agni and Soma, may I be a slayer of foes', he says; by
means of Agni and Soma Indra slew Vrtra; verily by means of them he lays
low his foe. 'By sacrifice to the gods, Indra and Agni, may I be
powerful and an eater of food', he says; verily he becomes powerful and
an eater of food. 'By sacrifice to the god Indra, may I be powerful', he
says; verily he becomes powerful. 'By sacrifice to the god Mahendra, may
I attain superiority and greatness', he says; verily he attains
superiority and greatness. 'By sacrifice to the god Agni Svistakrt, may
I attain security through the sacrifice, enjoying long life', he says;
verily he confers long life upon himself and attains security through
the sacrifice.

q The guardian Indra, the helper Indra,

I invoke the strong one, invoked of many, Indra;

r May we not \[5\], O strong one, in this distress,  
Be handed over to evil, O lord of the ways;  
Guard us with true protection;  
May we be dear to you among the princes.  
s The Anus have wrought a chariot for thy steed;  
Tvastr a glorious bolt, O thou invoked of many;  
The Brahmans magnifying Indra with their praises  
Have strengthened him for the slaying of the serpent.  
t What time the strong sang praise to the strong,  
O Indra, the stones and Aditi in unison,  
Without steeds or chariots were the fellies  
Which, sped by Indra, rolled against the Dasyus.

## PRAPATHAKA VII

The Part of the Sacrificer in the New and Full Moon Sacrifices

i\. 7. 1. Cattle attend the cooked offerings of him who has established
a fire. The cooked offering is the Ida; it is placed in the world of the
sacrifice between the fore- and the after-offerings. Over it as it is
brought up he should say, 'O thou of fair rain colour, come hither'; the
cattle are the Ida; verily he summons cattle. The gods milked the
sacrifice, the sacrifice milked the Asuras; the Asuras, being milked by
the sacrifice, were defeated; he, who knowing the milking of the
sacrifice \[1\] sacrifices, milks another sacrificer. 'May the blessing
of this sacrifice be fulfilled for me', he says; this is the milking of
the sacrifice; verily with it he milks it. The cow is milked willingly,
and willingly the Ida is milked for the sacrificer; these are the teats
of Ida, 'Ida is invoked'. Vayu is the calf. When the Hotr summons the
Ida, then the sacrificer looking at the Hotr should in mind reflect on
Vayu \[2\]; verily he lets the calf go to the mother. By the whole
sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven; Manu laboured with the
cooked offering; the Ida went to Manu; the gods and the Asuras called
severally upon her, the gods directly, the Asuras indirectly; she went
to the gods; the cattle choose the gods, cattle deserted the Asuras. If
he desire of a man, 'May he be without cattle', he should invoke the Ida
indirectly for him; verily he becomes without cattle \[3\]. If he desire
of a man, 'May he be rich in cattle', he should invoke the Ida directly
for him; verily he becomes rich in cattle. The theologians say, 'He
would invoke the Ida indeed who in invoking the Ida should invoke
himself in the Ida.' 'To us be she dear, victorious, bountiful', he
says; verily in invoking the Ida he invokes himself in the Ida. The Ida
is as it were a breach in the sacrifice; half they eat \[4\], half they
wipe; in this regard the sacrifice of the Asuras was broken; the gods
united it by the holy power (Brahman). 'May Brhaspati extend this for
us', he says; Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily
by the holy power (Brahman) he unites the sacrifice. 'May he unite this
scattered sacrifice', he says, for continuity. 'May the All-gods rejoice
here', he says; verily continuing the sacrifice he indicates it to the
gods. The \[5\] sacrificial fee which he gives at the sacrifice his
cattle accompany; he having sacrificed is like to become without cattle;
'the sacrificer must so arrange', they say, 'that he may place among the
gods what is given, but keep his cattle with himself.' 'Swell, O ruddy
one', he says; the ruddy one is the sacrifice; verily he magnifies the
sacrifice; thus he places among the gods what is given, but keeps his
cattle with himself. 'May (my act) as I give be not destroyed', he says;
verily he avoids destruction; 'May (my act) as I work not perish', he
says; verily he attains prosperity.

### i. 7. 2.

Samçravas Sauvarcanasa said to Tumiñja Aupoditi: 'When thou hast been a
Hotr of Sattrins, what Ida hast thou invoked?' 'Her I have invoked', he
said, 'who supports the gods by her expiration, men by her
cross-breathing, and the Pitrs by her inspiration.' 'Does she divide, or
does she not divide' (he asked). 'She divides', he replied. 'Her body
then hast thou invoked', he said. Her body is the cow \[1\]; of the cow
were they two talking. She who is given in the sacrifice supports the
gods with her expiration; she by whom men live (supports) men by her
cross-breathing; she whom they slay for the Fathers (supports) the
Fathers by her inspiration; he who knows thus becomes rich in cattle.
'Her too I have invoked', he said, 'who is available to people as they
increase.' 'Her food then \[2\] hast thou invoked', he replied. This
food is plants, plants are available to people as they increase; he who
knows thus becomes an eater of food. 'Her too I have invoked', he said,
who supports people in distress and succours them as they improve.' Her
support then hast thou invoked', he replied. Her support is this (earth)
\[3\], this (earth) supports people in distress and succours them as
they improve; he who knows thus finds support. 'Her too I have invoked',
he said, 'in whose step people drink the ghee they live upon.' 'Does she
divide, or does she not divide?' (he asked). 'She does not divide', he
said, 'but she propagates.' 'Indeed hast thou invoked the Ida herself ',
he replied. The Ida is rain; in the step of rain people drink the ghee
they live upon; he who knows thus is propagated with offspring; he
becomes an eater of food.

### i. 7. 3.

Secretly offering is made to one set of gods, openly to another. The
gods who receive offering secretly, he thus offers to them in sacrifice;
in that he brings the Anvaharya mess--the Brahmans are the gods
openly--them he verily delights. This is his sacrificial fee: verily he
mends the rent in the sacrifice; whatever in the sacrifice is harsh or
is injured, that he makes good (*anvaharati*) \[1\] with the Anvaharya
mess, and that is why it has its name. Now the priests are the
messengers of the gods; in that he brings the Anvaharya mess, he
delights the messengers of the gods. Prajapati distributed the sacrifice
to the gods; he reflected that he was empty; he per ceived this
Anvaharya mess unallotted; he conferred it upon himself. The Anvaharya
is connected with Prajapati; he, who knowing thus brings the Anvaharya,
assuredly enjoys Prajapati. An unlimited amount should be poured out,
Prajapati is unlimited; (verily it serves) to win Prajapati \[2\].
Whatever the gods did in the sacrifice, the Asuras did; the gods
perceived the Anvaharya connected with Prajapati; they seized it - then
the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated; he who knowing thus brings
the Anvaharya prospers himself, his foe is defeated. By the sacrifice
there is offering, by the cooked food satisfying. He who knowing thus
brings the Anvaharya, accomplishes at once sacrifice and satisfaction.
'Thou art the portion of Prajapati' \[3\], he says; verily he unites
Prajapati with his own portion. 'Full of strength and milk', he says;
verily he confers upon him strength and milk. 'Protect my expiration and
inspiration; protect my breathing together and cross-breathing', he
says; verily he invokes this blessing. 'Thou art imperishable, for
imperishableness thee; mayst thou not perish for me, yonder, in yonder
world', he says. Food perishes in yonder world, for given hence in
yonder world people live upon it; in that he touches thus, he makes it
imperishable; his food perishes not in yonder world.

### i. 7. 4.

'By I sacrifice to the divine strew, may I be possessed of children', he
says; by the strew Prajapati created offspring, verily he creates
offspring. 'By sacrifice to the god Naraçansa, may I be possessed of
cattle', he says; by Naraçansa Prajapati created cattle; verily he
creates cattle. 'By sacrifice to the god, Agni Svistakrt, may I attain
security through the sacrifice, having long life', he says; verily he
confers life on himself, and finds support through the sacrifice. With
the victory of the new and full moon sacrifices \[1\] the gods
conquered, and by means of the new and full moon sacrifices they drove
away the Asuras. 'May I be victorious through the victory of Agni', he
says; verily through the victory of the deities in the new and full moon
sacrifices the sacrificer is victorious, and by means of the new and
full moon offerings drives away his enemies. With two verses containing
the word 'strength', he accompanies the separation (of the ladles)
strength is food verily he wins food; (he uses) two, for support. He who
sacrifices knowing the two milkings of the sacrifice milks thus the
sacrifice on both sides \[2\], in front and behind; this is one milking
of the sacrifice, another is in the Ida. When the Hotr utters the name
of the sacrificer, then he should say, 'Hither these blessings have
come, fain for milking'; verily he milks the deities which he praises
together; verily he milks the sacrifice on both sides, in front and
behind. 'With the red steed may Agni convey thee to the god', he says;
these are the steeds of the gods \[3\], the straw is the sacrificer; in
that he casts forward the straw with them, he makes the sacrificers to
go by the steeds of the gods to the world of heaven. 'I unyoke thy head
ropes, thy reins', he says; that is the unyoking of Agni; verily thereby
he unyokes him. 'By sacrifice to the god Visnu, by the sacrifice may I
attain health and wealth and security', he says; Visnu is the sacrifice;
verily the sacrifice finds support at the end. 'By sacrifice to the god
Soma, possessing good seed \[4\], may I impregnate seed', he says; Soma
is the impregnator of seed; verily he confers seed upon himself. 'By
sacrifice to the god Tvastr, may I prosper the form of cattle'; Tvastr
is the form-maker of the pairings of cattle, and thereby he confers upon
himself the form of cattle. 'The wives of the gods, Agni, the lord of
the house, are the pair of the sacrifice; by sacrifice to these deities
may I be propagated with a pair.' 'Thou art the bundle, thou art gain,
may I gain', he says; by the bundle (*vedena*) the gods won
(*avindanta*) the desirable wealth of the Asuras, and that is why the
bundle has its name. Whatever of his foe's he may covet, the name of
that he should utter; verily he wing it all from him. 'May the bundle
bestow increase of wealth, rich in ghee, rich in houses, a thousandfold,
strong', he says; he obtains a thousand cattle. In his offspring a
strong one is born who knows thus.

### i. 7. 5.

Through the emptying of the Dhruva the sacrifice is emptied, through the
sacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. Through the
swelling of the Dhruva, the sacrifice is made to swell, through the
sacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. 'Let the
Dhruva swell with ghee', he says; verily he makes the Dhruva to swell;
through its swelling the sacrifice is made to swell, through the
sacrifice the sacri ficer, throuo - h the sacrificer offspring.
'Prajapati's is the world called Vibhan. In it I place thee along with
the sacrificer', he says \[1\]; the world of Prajapati, named Vibhan, is
this (world); verily he places it in it along with the sacrificer. In
that he sacrifices he is as it were emptied; in that he eats the
sacrificer's portion, he fills himself. The sacrifice is the size of the
sacrificer's portion, the sacrificer is the sacrifice; in that he eats
the sacrificer's portion, he places the sacrifice in the sacrifice.
There is good grass and good water where the strew and the waters are
\[2\]; the Vedi is the abode of the sacrificer; in that he places the
full bowl within the Vedi, he establishes good grass and good water in
his own abode. 'Thou art real, be real for me', he says; the sacrifice
is the waters, ambrosia is the water; verily he bestows upon himself the
sacrifice and the waters. All creatures attend him who is performing the
vow. 'In the eastern quarter may the gods, the priests, make (me)
bright', he says; this is the concluding bath of the new and full moon
sacrifices \[3\]. He goes to the bath along with the creatures which
attend him as he performs the vow. Headed by Visnu the gods won these
worlds by the metres so as to be irrecoverable; in that he takes the
steps of Visnu the sacrificer becoming Visnu wins these worlds by the
metres so as to be irrecoverable. 'Thou art the step of Visnu, smiting
imprecations', he says; the earth is the Gayatri, the atmosphere is
connected with the Tristubh, the sky is the Jagati, the quarters are
connected with the Anustubh; verily by the metres he wins these worlds
in order.

### i. 7. 6.

'We have come to the heaven: to the heaven we have come', he says;
verily he goes to the world of heaven. 'May I not be cut off from seeing
thee; what heat is thine, to that of thee may I not be brought low', he
says; that is according to the text. 'Thou art good, the best of rays;
thou art life-bestowing, bestow life upon me', he says; verily he
invokes this blessing. He falls away from this world, who \[1\] takes
the steps of Visnu, for from the world of heaven the steps of Visnu are
taken. The theologians say, 'He indeed would take the steps of Visnu who
after acquiring these worlds of his foe should descend again to this
world.' This is his return descent to this world, in that he says,'Here
do I exclude my enemy N. N. from these quarters, from this sky'; verily
having acquired these worlds of his foe he descends again to this world.
'I have been united \[2\] with the light', he says; verily he rests on
this world. 'I turn the turning of Indra', he says; Indra is yonder sun;
verily he turns his turning. He turns to the right; verily he revolves
round his own strength; therefore the right side of a man is the
stronger; verily also he turns the turning of the sun. 'May I be united
with offspring, offspring with me', he says; verily \[3\] he invokes
this blessing. 'Kindled, O Agni, shine for me; kindling thee, O Agni,
may I shine', he says; that is according to the text. 'Be rich the
sacrifice; may I be rich', he says; verily he invokes this blessing.
Within the Garhapatya much variegated work is performed; with two verses
to Agni, the purifier, he pays reverence to the Garhapatya; verily he
purifies the fire, he purifies himself; (he uses) two for support. 'O
Agni, lord of the house', he says \[4\]; that is according to the text.
'For a hundred winters', he says; 'for a hundred winters may I kindle
thee', he says in effect. He utters the name of his son; verily he makes
him an eater of food. 'This prayer I utter, bringing light for the
race', he should say who has no son born to him, verily is born to him a
brilliant and resplendent son. 'This prayer I utter, bringing light to
N. N.', he should say who has a son born \[5\]; verily he bestows upon
him brilliance and splendour. He who having yoked the sacrifice does not
let it free becomes without a support. 'Who yoketh thee? Let him set
thee free', he says; Who (*ka*) is Prajapati; verily by Prajapati he
yokes him, by Prajapati he lets him free, for support. The vow if not
released is liable to consume (the sacrificer); 'O Agni, lord of vows, I
have performed my vow', he says; verily he releases his vow \[6\], for
atonement, to prevent burning. The sacrifice goes away, and turns not
back; to him who sacrifices knowing the restoration of the sacrifice it
does turn back; 'The sacrifice hath become, it hath come into being', he
says; this is the restoration of the sacrifice, and thereby he restores
it. Excellence has not been obtained by him who having established a
fire has no retinue; cattle indeed are the retinue of a Brahman. Having
sacrificed, he should step forward to the east and say, 'Rich in cattle,
in sheep, O Agni, in horses is the sacrificer'; he wins his retinue, he
obtains a thousand cattle, in his offspring a strong one is born.
