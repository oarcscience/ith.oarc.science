# LXXXVI.

1\. Now follows the ceremony of setting a bull at liberty, (which should
take place)

2\. On the days of full moon in Kârttika or Â*s*vina.

When performing this rite, he must first examine the bull.

\[63. The term mano*g*ña, 'a pleasant spot,' means 'a place close by the
house, where sacred basil is planted,' or other such places. (Nand.)

67\. <sup>1</sup> See the next chapter,

LXXXVI\. 1-18. Pâr. III, 9; *S*â<u>n</u>kh. III, 11. Regarding the
corresponding section of the Kâ*th*aka G*ri*hya-sûtra, see
Introduction.\]

4\. (The bull must be) the offspring of a milch cow having young ones
living.

5\. He must have all marks.

6\. He must be dark-coloured;

7\. Or red, but having a white mouth, a white tail.. and white feet and
horns.

8\. He must be one who protects the herd.

9\. Then, after having (kindled) a blazing fire among the cows (in the
cow-pen) and strewed Ku*s*a grass around it, let him boil with milk a
dish sacred to Pûshan, and offer (two oblations) in the fire with the
Mantras, 'May Pûshan follow our cows<sup>\[1\]</sup>,' and 'Here is
pleasure<sup>\[2\]</sup>.' And let a blacksmith mark the bull.

10\. On the one flank (the right), with a discus; on the other flank
(the left), with a trident.

11\. After he has been marked, let him wash the bull with the four
Mantras, (beginning with the words), 'The
golden-coloured<sup>\[1\]</sup>,' and with (the five Mantras, beginning
with the words), 'May the divine (waters help and propitiate
us')<sup>\[2\]</sup>.

12\. Having washed and adorned the bull, he must bring him near,
together with four young cows,

\[5. 'I.e. the bull must not be deficient in any limb.' (Nand.) This
interpretation is supported by the G*ri*hya-sûtras.

6\. Nand. mentions two interpretations of the term nîla,
'dark-coloured:' 1. a bull who is all white, and is therefore said to be
of the 'Brâhma*n*a kind;' 2. one whose body is white, whereas his tail,
his hoofs, and his face are black, and his horns blue. Cf. L, 25.

8\. Nand. interprets yûthasyâ*kh*âdakam by nishektâram, 'one who covers
the cows.' My rendering is based upon Devapâla's comment on the
corresponding passage of the Kâ*th*aka G*ri*hya-sûtra. See also Pâr. and
Sâ<u>n</u>kh. loc. cit.

9\. <sup>1</sup> Rig-veda VI, 54, 5, &c.--<sup>2</sup> Vagas. Sa*m*h.
VIII, 51; Kâ*th*. Â*s*v. IV, 6, &c.

11\. <sup>1</sup> Taitt. Sa*m*h. V, 6, 1, 1, 2, &c. Rig-veda X, 9, 4 -8.
&c.\]

which must also have been washed and decorated, and he must mutter the
Rudras<sup>\[1\]</sup>, the Purushasûkta, and the
Kûshmâ*nd*îs<sup>\[2\]</sup>.

13\. Then let him pronounce in the bull's right ear the Mantra, 'The
father of calves;'

14\. And the following (Mantras):

15\. 'Holy law is a bull and is declared to have four
feet<sup>\[1\]</sup>: him I choose for the object of my worship; may he
protect me wholly.

16\. 'This young (bull) I give you as husband (O ye calves), roam about
sportingly with him for your lover. May we not be deficient in progeny,
O king Soma, and may we live long, and may we not be oppressed by our
enemies.'

17\. He must drive away the bull together with the calves in a
north-eastern direction and give a pair of garments, gold, and a vessel
made of white copper to the officiating priest.

18\. The blacksmith shall receive as wages as much as he claims, and
food prepared with a great deal of butter, and (three) Brâhma*n*as shall
be fed.

19\. Any pool from which the bull drinks after

\[12. 'Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 5, 1-11.--<sup>2</sup> See LVI, 7.

13\. Nand. states expressly that this Mantra is from the Kâ*th*aka. It
is found Kâ*th*. XIII, 9; Taitt. Sa*m*h. III, 3, 9, 2; Kâ*th*.
G*ri*hya-sûtra XLVII.

15\. <sup>1</sup> This term refers perhaps to the 'four feet of a
judicial proceeding.' See Nârada I, 11; 2, 9.

16\. Taitt. Sa*m*h. III, 3, 9, 1, &c. The second half of this Mantra is
found in the Kâ*th*aka G*ri*hya-sûtra only.

18\. The clause regarding the 'food,' which has been rendered in
accordance with Nand.'s Commentary, might also be construed with 'fed,'
which would bring the whole into accordance with the precepts of the
Kâ*th*aka G*ri*hya-sûtra and of the two other G*ri*hya-sûtras.\]

having been set at liberty) that entire pool will refresh the manes of
him who has set the bull at liberty.

20\. The earth which is anywhere dug up by the bull exulting in his
strength, is converted into delicious food and drink to satisfy the
manes.
