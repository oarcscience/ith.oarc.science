# LXXXIII.

1\. The following persons sanctify a company:

2\. A Tri*n*â*k*iketa;

\[27. See LXIV, 5, note.

29\. The particle *k*a here refers to the following further persons
mentioned in a Sm*ri*ti, a shepherd, one who lives by the prostitution
of his own wife, the husband of a woman who had another husband before,
and one employed to carry out dead bodies. (Nand.)

LXXXIII\. 1-19. M. III, 128-148, 183-146; Y. I, 219-221; Âpast. II, 7,
17, 22; Gaut. XV, 28.

2\. Nand. has two explanations of the term Tri*n*â*k*iketa: 1. One who
has thrice kindled the Nâ*k*iketa fire. 2. One who has studied,
{footnote p. 254} in consequence of a vow, the portion of the
Ya*g*ur-veda called Tri*n*â*k*iketa. See Âpast. II, 7, 17, 22, with Dr.
Bühler's note, and the Petersburg Dictionary.\]

3\. One who keeps five fires;

4\. One who can sing the Sâmans called *G*yesh*th*a;

5\. One who has studied the whole Veda;

6\. One who has studied one Vedâ<u>n</u>ga;

7\. One who has studied either the Purâ*n*as (Legends), or the Itihâsas
(Epics), or grammar;

8\. One who has studied one of the Dharma*s*âstras (Institutes of the
Sacred Law);

9\. One purified by visiting sacred places of pilgrimage;

10\. One purified by offering sacrifices;

11\. One purified by austere devotion;

12\. One purified by veracity;

13\. One purified by (constantly muttering) Mantras;

14\. One intent upon muttering the *G*âyatrî;

15\. One in whose family the study and teaching of the Veda are
hereditary.

16\. One who knows the Trisupar*n*a (the text which thrice contains the
word Supar*n*a).

\[4. Sâma-veda II, 209-211, &c.

7\. Grammar is again mentioned here, although it forms part of the
Vedâ<u>n</u>gas mentioned in Sûtra 6. But there the Prâti*s*âkhyas are
meant. (Nand.)

8\. The number of the Sm*ri*tis or Dharma*s*âstras, according to Nand.,
amounts to fifty-seven. The now current tradition gives thirty-six as
their number; but upwards of a hundred works of this description must
have been actually in existence. See Dr. Bühler's Introduction to the
Bombay Digest, p. xii seq.

16\. See above, LVI, 22 3, and Dr. Bühler's note on Âpast. loc. cit.
Nand. proposes another interpretation also of the term Trisupar*n*a, 6
one who has thrice kindled a fire in honour of Supar*n*a.'\]

17\. A son-in-law;

18\. And a grandson. All these persons are worthy (to be fed at a
*S*râddha);

19\. And, particularly, devotees.

20, There is a stanza recited by the manes, which refers to this
subject:

21\. 'May that man be born to our race, who feeds a Brâhma*n*a devotee
assiduously at a *S*râddha, by which repast we are satisfied ourselves.'
