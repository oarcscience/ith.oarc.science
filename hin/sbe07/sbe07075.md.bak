# LXXIII.

1\. One desirous of celebrating a *S*râddha must invite the Brâhma*n*as
on the day before (it is to take place).

2\. On the next day, in the forenoon, if it falls in the bright half of
the month, and in the afternoon, if it falls in the dark half of the
month, the Brâhma*n*as, who must have duly bathed and duly sipped water,
must be placed by him, in the order of their seniority' (or) of their
sacred knowledge, upon seats covered with Ku*s*a grass.

3\. (He must entertain) two (Brâhma*n*as) facing the east at the
*S*râddha of the gods (Vi*s*vedevâs), and three facing the north at the
*S*râddha of the manes;

4\. Or one only at each *S*râddha.

5\. After having (worshipped the Vi*s*vedevâs and) offered a
burnt-oblation: during the recitation of the first Pañ*k*aka (pentad) at
a *S*râddha repast consisting

\[LXXIII. 1-32. Â*s*v. II, 5, 11-14; IV, 7; Gobh. IV, 2-4; Pâr. III, 10,
48-55; *S*â<u>n</u>kh. IV, 1; M. III, 125, 204-259; Y. I, 225-248;
Âpast. II, 7, 17, 11-19; Gaut. XV, Regarding the corresponding section
of the Kâ*th*aka G*ri*hya-sûtra, see Introduction. This chapter opens
the section on *S*râddhas (funeral oblations), which consists of
thirteen chapters (LXXIII-LXXXV. Nand.)

1\. The Ekoddish*t*a and Sapi*nd*îkara*n*a *S*râddhas have been
described above, XXI. The rules given in the present chapter refer to
all the remaining kinds of *S*râddhas, See 5-9, LXXIV, LXXVI-LXXVIII.

2\. <sup>1</sup> At the *S*râddha of the manes the oldest Brâhma*n*a
represents the great-grandfather; the one next to him in age, the
grandfather; the youngest of the three, the father of the sacrificer.
(Nand.)

5-9. The three Pañ*k*akas referred to in Sûtras 5-9 are respectively vv.
1-5, 6-10, and 11-15 of Kâ*th*aka XXXIX, 10. (Nand.) The great majority
of the Mantras quoted in Sûtras 11-26 have {footnote p. 233} not been
traced in the Berlin US. of the Kâ*th*aka, nor indeed in any other
Sa*m*hitâ of the Veda, but there can be no doubt that they, belong, to
the school of the Ka*th*as, as nearly all are quoted by their Pratîkas
in the Kâ*th*aka G*ri*hya-sûtra, and given at full in Devapâla's
Commentary on the latter. The above renderings of the Pratîkas rest upon
Devapâla's interpretations. That the rules in 5 seq. teach the
performance of a *S*râddha according to the rites of the Ka*th*a school,
is confirmed by Nand. in his remarks on 5 seq. and 9 seq.\]

of undressed grain or performed for the gratification of a special
desire\[1\];

6\. At a *S*râddha repast consisting of meat, during the recitation of
the second Pañ*k*aka;

7\. At a new moon (*S*râddha), during the recitation of the last
Pañ*k*aka;

8\. On the Ash*t*akâs (or eighth days) of the (three) dark halves
subsequent to the full moon day of the month Âgrahâya*n*a (or
Mârga*s*îrsha)<sup>\[1\]</sup>, during the recitation of the first,
second, and last Pañ*k*akas respectively;

9\. Likewise on the Anvash*t*akâs (or ninth days of the dark halves of
those months);

10\. He must invite the manes, after having received permission to do so
from the Brâhma*n*as<sup>\[1\]</sup>.

11\. Having driven away the Yâtudhânas by strewing grains of sesamum and
by reciting the two

\[5. <sup>1</sup> See LXXVIll.

8\. The days referred to are the eighth days of the dark halves of the
months Mârga*s*îrsha, Pausha, and Mâgha.

9\. 'And on the *S*râddhas taking place on the seventh day of the dark
half, as *k*a indicates.' (Nand.) This statement does not, however,
deserve much credit, as such *S*râddhas are neither mentioned in our
work nor in the Kâ*th*aka G*ri*hya-sûtra.

10\. <sup>1</sup> 'The permission of the Brâhma*n*as has to be asked
with the Mantra, "I shall invite (the manes);" and their answer must be,
"Invite the,!"' (Nand.)

11\. The Yâtudhânas are a class of demons supposed to disturb {footnote
p. 234} the effect of a *S*râddha. The second Mantra, according to
Devapâla, is from the Rig-veda, X, 15, 1.\]

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

Mantras (the first of which begins with the words), 'May the Asuras go
away;'

12\. He must invite the manes (with the four Mantras), 'Come near, O ye
manes,' '(Conduct) them all (here), O Agni,' 'May my (ancestors) come
near,' 'This is your (share), O ye manes.' Then let him prepare the
water for washing the feet with scented water, which has been mixed up
with Kusa grass and sesamum, while reciting (the three Mantras), 'Those
standing<sup>\[1\]</sup>,' 'Speech is imperishable,' and 'What my mother
(has sinned)<sup>\[1\]</sup>,' and offer it (to the Brâhma*n*as); let
him prepare the Arghya (or water mixed with Dûrvâ grass, flowers, &c.)
and offer it to them; let him offer to the Brâhma*n*as, to the best of
his power, Ku*s*a grass, sesamum, clothes, flowers, ornaments, incense,
and lamps; let him take food sprinkled with clarified butter; let him
look them in the face with the Mantra, 'O ye Âdityas, Rudras, and
Vasus;' let him say, 'I will offer an oblation in the fire,' and if the
Brâhma*n*as say, 'Offer an oblation,' let him offer three
burnt-oblations<sup>\[2\]</sup>.'

13\. After having consecrated the offerings with the Mantras, 'They, who
are my ancestors,' 'This is your (share), O ye manes,' and 'This
offering,' he must pour (what is left of) the food into such vessels as
happen to be there, or (into golden ones at the offering addressed to
the Vi*s*vedevâs and) into silver

\[12. <sup>1</sup> These two Mantras are also quoted, with slight
variations, by *S*â<u>n</u>khâyana III, 13, 5.--<sup>2</sup> The three
burnt-oblations have to be accompanied by the recitation of the three
Mantras, 'To Soma accompanied by the manes svadhâ nama*h*; to Yama
A<u>n</u>giras svadhâ nama*h*; to Agni who takes the offerings addressed
to the manes svadhâ nama*h*.' (Nand.)\]

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

ones (at the offering addressed to the manes), and offer it first to the
two Brâhma*n*as facing the east (who have been invited to the *S*râddha
of the gods).

14\. Afterwards he must offer it to the (three) Brâhma*n*as facing north
(who represent his three ancestors, addressing himself) to his father,
grandfather and great-grandfather, (and calling out) their name and
race.

15\. While the Brâhma*n*as are eating the food, let him mutter (the
three Mantras), 'Whatever (trickles down) through my fault,' 'With days
and nights<sup>\[1\]</sup>,' and 'Whatever (limb) of yours, Agni.'

16\. And (let him mutter) the Itihâsa (Epics), Purâ*n*a (Legends), and
the Dharma*s*âstra (Institutes of the Sacred Law).

17\. Near the leavings let him deposit upon blades of Ku*s*a grass with
the ends turned towards the south one ball of rice for his father, while
saying, 'Earth is (like) a spoon, imperishable (satisfaction).'

18\. With the Mantra, 'Air is (like) a spoon, imperishable
(satisfaction,' let him deposit) a second ball for his grandfather.

19\. With the Mantra, 'Heaven is (like) a spoon, imperishable
(satisfaction,' let him deposit) a third ball for his great-grandfather.

20\. With the Mantra, 'Those ancestors who

\[14. The formula of this invocation, according to Nand., is this, 'To
NN., my ancestor, of the Gotra NN., who is like a Vasu, (I offer) this
food, svadhâ nama*h*.' The use of the particle *k*a, according to the
same, implies that the maternal grandfather and the other maternal
ancestors must also be addressed as ordained below (LXXV, 7).

15\. <sup>1</sup> A similar Mantra is quoted, *S*â<u>n</u>kh, III, 13,
5.\]

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

have died,' let him place a garment (upon the balls).

21\. With the Mantra, 'Give us sons, O ye manes,' (let him place) food
upon them.

22\. With the Mantra, 'Enjoy it, O ye manes, partake of it, (each
according to his share<sup>\[1\]</sup>,' let him wipe off the grease
from his hands with the ends of the blades.

23, With the Mantra, '(Ye waters) imparting vigour<sup>\[1\]</sup>,' let
him sprinkle the balls to the right with the wet (remainder of the
food), and offer the Argha<sup>\[2\]</sup>, flowers, incense, unguents,
and rice, and other victuals and dainties to the Brâhma*n*as.

24\. And (he must offer them, ) a jar with water, which has been mixed
up with honey, clarified butter, sesamum, and (ointments, oil, and the
like).

25\. The Brâhma*n*as having eaten and being satisfied, let him sprinkle
the food (as much as has been left by them) and the grass with the
Mantra, 'Mayest thou not fail me,' and strew the food near the leavings;
and having asked them, 'Are you satisfied? Is (the *S*râddha) finished,'
he must first give water for sipping to the Brâhma*n*as facing the
north, and then to those facing the east; and he must sprinkle the place
where the *S*râddha has been offered (with water, with the Mantra),
'Well sprinkled.' All these rites he must perform while holding blades
of sacred grass in his hand.

26\. Afterwards he must, while turning his face towards the Brâhma*n*as
facing the east, circumambulate

\[22. <sup>1</sup> Vâ*g*asan. Sa*m*h. II, 31; Kâ*th*. IX, 6.

23\. <sup>1</sup> Vâ*g*asan. Sa*m*h. II, 34.--<sup>2</sup> The Argha is
a respectful offering, tile ingredients of which vary.\]

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

them from left to right, with the Mantra, 'What a crow (may have eaten
of my offering),' and turn back again; he must honour them with
sacrificial fees, to the best of his power, saying, 'May you be
satisfied,' and on their answering, 'We are satisfied,' he must address
them with the Mantra, 'The gods and the manes.'

27\. After having given (to all) water (with the Mantra, 'May the food
and water and whatever else I gave you be) imperishable,' (and calling
out their name and race, and having added the Mantra, 'May the
Vi*s*vedevâs be satisfied,' he must ask, with folded hands, and with an
attentive and cheerful mind, the following (benediction) from the
Brâhma*n*as facing the east:

28\. 'May the liberal-minded in our race increase in number, and may the
(study of the) Vedas and our progeny (also increase). May faith not
depart from us, and may we have plenty to bestow on the poor.

29\. They shall answer, 'Thus let it be.'

30\. (The second half of the benediction shall be, as follows), "May we
have plenty of food, and may we receive guests. May others come to beg
of us, and may not we be obliged to beg of any one.'

31\. After having received this double benediction (through the
Brâhma*n*as saying, 'Thus let it be'),

32\. He must dismiss the Brâhma*n*as, with the Mantra, 'With all
food<sup>\[1\]</sup>,' after having honoured them according to custom,
accompanied them (as far as the limits of his estate), and taken his
leave of them.

\[32. <sup>1</sup> Rig-veda VII, 38, 8.\]
