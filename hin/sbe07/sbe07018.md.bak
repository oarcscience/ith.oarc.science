1\. On women equal in caste (to their husbands) sons are begotten, who
are equal in caste (to their fathers).

2\. On women of lower caste than their husbands sons are begotten, who
follow the caste of their mothers.

3\. On women of higher caste than their husbands sons are begotten, who
are despised by the twice-born.

4\. Among these, the son of a *S*ûdra with a Vai*s*ya woman is called
Âyogava.

5\. The Pukkasa and Mâgadha are sons of a Vai*s*ya and *S*ûdra
respectively with a Kshatriya woman.

6\. The *K*a*nd*âla, Vaidehaka, and Sûta are the sons of a *S*ûdra,
Vai*s*ya, and Kshatriya respectively with a Brâhma*n*a woman.

7\. Besides these, there are innumerable other mixed castes produced by
further intermixture between those that have been mentioned.

8\. Âyogavas must live by artistic performances (such as public
wrestling, dancing, and the like).

9\. Pukkasas must live by hunting.

10\. Mâgadhas must live by calling out in public the good qualities (of
saleable commodities).

11\. *K*a*nd*âlas must live by executing criminals sentenced to death.

women and profiting by what they earn.

13\. Sûtas must live by managing horses.

14\. *K*a*nd*âlas must live out of the town, and their clothes must be
the mantles of the deceased. In this their condition is different (from,
and lower than that of the other mixed castes).

15\. All (members of mixed castes) should have intercourse (of marriage,
and other community) only between themselves.

16\. (In the lower castes also) the son inherits the property of his
father.

17\. All members of those mixed castes, whether their descent has been
kept secret or is generally known, may be found out by their acts.

18\. Desertion of life, regardless of reward, in order to save a
Brâhma*n*a, or a cow, or for the sake of a woman or child, may confer
heavenly bliss even upon (members of those) base castes.
