# XVIII.

1\. If there are four sons of a Brâhma*n*a (springing from four
different wives) of the four castes, they shall divide the whole estate
of their father into ten parts.

2\. Of these, let the soil of the Brâhma*n*a wife take four parts;

3\. The son of the Kshatriya wife, three parts;

4\. The son of the Vai*s*ya wife, two parts;

5\. The son of the *S*ûdra wife, a single part.

\[22. My rendering of this Sloka is based upon Kullûka's interpretation
of the identical passage of Manu (IX, 200), which is supported by
Vi*g*ñânesvara (Mitâksharâ I, 4, 19 in Colebrooke's version), Mâdhava
(Burnell, Dâya-Vibhâga 51), Varadarâ*g*a (Burnell, Varadarâ*g*a's
Vyavahâranîr*n*aya 49), and others. Nand. proposes a different
interpretation, on which rests Dr. Bühler's rendering, 'Those ornaments,
which the wives usually wear, should not be divided by the heirs whilst
the husbands are alive.'

6\. Again, if there are three sons of a Brâhma*n*a (by wives of
different castes), but no son by a *S*ûdra (wife) among them, they shall
divide the estate into nine parts.

7\. (Of these) let them take, each in the order of his caste, shares
amounting to four, three, and two parts of the whole respectively.

8\. (If there are three sons by wives of different castes, but) no
Vai*s*ya among them, they shall divide the estate into eight parts, and
take four parts, three parts, and one part respectively.

9\. (If there are three sons, but) no Kshatriya among them, they shall
divide it into seven parts, and take four parts, two parts, and a single
part respectively.

10\. If there is no Brâhma*n*a, among them, they hall divide it into six
parts, and take three parts, two parts, and a single part respectively.

11\. If there are sons of a Kshatriya by a Kshatriya, a Vai*s*ya, and a
*S*ûdra wife, the mode of division shall be the same (i.e. the estate
shall be divided into six parts, &c.)

12\. Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhma*n*a, the one belonging to
the Brâhma*n*a and the other to the Kshatriya caste, they shall divide
the estate into seven parts; and of these the Brâhma*n*a son shall take
four parts;

13\. The Kshatriya son, three parts.

14\. Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhma*n*a, and the one belongs
to the Brâhma*n*a and the other to the Vai*s*ya caste, the estate shall
be divided into six parts; and of these, the Brâhma*n*a shall take four
parts;

15\. The Vai*s*ya, two parts.

10\. Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhma*n*a, and the one belongs
to the Brâhma*n*a and the other to the *S*ûdra caste, they shall divide
the estate into five parts;

17\. And of these, the Brâhma*n*a shall take four parts;

18\. The *S*ûdra, a single part.

19\. Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhma*n*a or a Kshatriya, and
the one belongs to the Kshatriya and the other to the *S*ûdra caste,
they shall divide the estate into five parts;

90\. And of these, the Kshatriya shall take three parts;

21\. The *S*ûdra, one part.

22\. Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhma*n*a or a Kshatriya, and
the one belongs to the Kshatriya, the other to the *S*ûdra caste, they
shall divide the estate into four parts;

23\. And of these, the Kshatriya shall take three parts;

24\. The *S*ûdra, a single part.

25\. Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhma*n*a or a Vai*s*ya or a
*S*ûdra, and the one belongs to the Vai*s*ya, the other to the *S*ûdra
caste, they shall divide the estate into three parts;

26\. And of these, the Vai*s*ya shall take two parts;

27\. The *S*ûdra, a single part,

28\. If a Brâhma*n*a has an only son, he shall take the whole estate,
provided he be a Brâhma*n*a, Kshatriya, or Vai*s*ya.

29\. If a Kshatriya has (an only son who is) either a Kshatriya or a
Vai*s*ya, (the rule shall be the same.)

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

30\. If a Vai*s*ya has (an only son who is) Vai*s*ya, (the rule shall
also be the same);

31\. (And so shall the only) son of a *S*ûdra (be sole heir) to his
*S*ûdra (father).

32\. A *S*ûdra, who is the only son of a father belonging to a
twice-born caste, shall inherit one-half of his property;

33\. The other half shall devolve in the same way as the property of one
who died without leaving issue.

34\. Mothers shall receive shares proportionate to their son's shares;

35\. And so shall unmarried daughters.

36\. Sons, who are equal in caste (to their father), shall receive equal
shares.

37\. A best part (the twentieth part of the inheritance, &c.) shall be
given to the eldest, as his additional share.

38\. If there are two sons by a Brâhma*n*a and one by a *S*ûdra wife,
the estate shall be divided into nine parts; and of these, the two sons
of the Brâhma*n*a wife shall take two parts, the one son of the *S*ûdra
wife, a single part.

39\. If there are two sons by a *S*ûdra, and one son by a Brâhma*n*a
wife, the estate shall be divided into six parts; and of these, the son
of the Brâhma*n*a wife shall take four parts, and the two sons of the
*S*ûdra wife together shall take two parts.

40\. Upon the same principles the shares have to be adjusted in other
cases also.

\[33. See XVII, 4 seq.

34\. 'That is to say, a Brâhma*n*a wife shall take four parts, a
Kshatriya wife, three parts,' &c. (Nand.)

37\. See Gaut. XXVIII, 5.\]

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

41\. If (brothers), who after a previous division of the estate live
again together as parceners, should make a second partition, the shares
must be equal in that case, and the eldest has no right to an additional
share.

42\. What a brother has acquired by, his own efforts, without using the
patrimony, he must not give up (to his brothers or other co-heirs),
unless by his own free will; for it was gained by his own exertion.

43\. And if a man recovers (a debt or other property), which could not
before be recovered by his father, he shall not, unless by his own free
will, divide it with his sons; for it is an acquisition made by himself.

44\. Apparel, vehicles<sup>\[1\]</sup> (carriages or riding-horses), and
ornaments (such as are usually worn according to the custom of the
caste), prepared food, water (in a well or pool), females (slaves or
mistresses of the deceased), property destined for pious uses or
sacrifices, a common pasture-ground<sup>\[2\]</sup>, and a book, are
indivisible.

\[42. The term svayamîhitalabdham has been translated according to
Kullûka (on M. IX, 208). Nand. interprets this *S*loka thus, 'What a
brother has acquired by his own efforts, and what has been given to him,
at his desire (by friends or others), he must not give up,' &c.

43\. Here again I have followed Kullûka (on M. IX, 209), and deviated
from Nand.'s interpretation, who renders this Sloka as follows, 'If a
man recovers property, &c., or if he gains property by himself (by his
learning or valour, &c.) . . . '

44\. <sup>1</sup> The term pattra has been rendered above in accordance
with the first interpretation proposed by Nand., and with Kullûka's
interpretation (on M. IX, 219). Vi*g*ñâne*s*vara (in his comment upon
the same passage of Manu) refers it to written documents, such
especially as relate to a debt to be paid to the deceased; and {footnote
p. 75} this interpretation is mentioned by Nand. also. But there is no
reason why an unliquidated demand should not be divided; and written
documents are only twice referred to in the code of Manu (VIII, 168, and
IX, 232).--<sup>2</sup> in translating the term pra*k*âra I have again
followed Kullûka loc. cit.; see also Petersburg Dictionary s. v. Nand.
interprets this term as denoting 'a path leading to or from the
house.'\]
