<P>3. Except poison from the <I>Sri</I><U>n</U>ga tree, which grows on the Him&acirc;layas.</P>
<P>4. (Of that) the judge must give seven grains, mixed with clarified butter, to the defendant (while reciting the prayer hereafter mentioned).</P>
<P>5. If the poison is digested easily, without violent symptoms, he shall recognise him as innocent, and dismiss him at the end of the day.</P>

<P>7. 'This man being arraigned in a cause, desires to be cleared from guilt. Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.'</P>
