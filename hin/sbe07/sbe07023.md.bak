# XXI.

1\. Now then <sup>\[1\]</sup>, (on the day) after the impurity is over,
let him bathe duly (during the recitation of Mantras), wash his hands
and feet duly, and sip water duly, (and having invited some
Brâhma*n*as), as many as possible, who must cleanse themselves in the
same way and turn their faces towards the north, let him bestow presents
of perfumes, garlands, clothes and other things (a lamp, frankincense,
and the like) upon them, and hospitably entertain them.

2\. At the Ekoddish*t*a (or *S*râddha for one recently deceased) let him
alter the Mantras<sup>\[1\]</sup> so as to refer to (the) one person
(deceased)\[2\].

\[XXI. 1-11. Â*s*v. IV, 7; Par. III, 10, 48-53; *S*â<u>n</u>kh. IV, 2;
M. III, 247; Y. III, 250, 251, 255.--12-23. *S*â<u>n</u>kh. IV, 3; V, 9;
Y. I, 252-254. Regarding the parallel passages of the Kâ*th*aka
G*ri*hya-sûtra, see the Introduction.

1\. <sup>1</sup> 'Having said, in the previous Chapter (XX, 30), that
"the obsequies should be performed," he now goes on to describe that
part of the obsequies which has not yet been expounded, viz. the "first
*S*râddha."' (Nand.)

2\. <sup>1</sup> The Mantras here referred to are those contained in the
description of the Pârva*n*a and other ordinary *S*râddhas in Chapter
LXXIII. Thus, the Mantra, 'This is your (share), ye manes' (LXXIII, 12,
13), has to be altered into, 'This is thy (share), father;' and so on.
Devapâla, in his Commentary on the Kâ*th*aka G*ri*hya-sûtra, gives an
accurate statement of all the modifications which the ordinary Mantras
have to undergo at the Ekoddish*t*a.-- <sup>2</sup> Nand. states that
not only the Mantras, but the whole ritual should be modified. The
nature of the latter modifications is stated by Yâ*g*ñavalkya loc. cit.
and by Sâ<u>n</u>khâyana loc. cit.\]

3\. Close to the food left (by the Brâhma*n*as) let him offer a ball of
rice, at the same time calling out his name and (that of) his race.

4\. The Brâhma*n*as having taken food and having been honoured with a
gift, let him offer, as imperishable food, water to the Brâhma*n*as,
after having called out the name and Gotra of the deceased; and let him
dig three trenches, each four A<u>n</u>gulas in breadth, their distance
from one another and their depth also measuring (four A<u>n</u>gulas),
and their length amounting to one Vitasti (or twelve A<u>n</u>gulas).

5\. Close by the trenches let him light three fires, and having added
fuel to them, let him make three oblations (of boiled rice) in each
(fire, saying),

6\. 'Svadhâ and reverence to Soma, accompanied by the manes.

7\. 'Svadhâ and reverence to Agni, who conveys the oblations addressed
to the manes.

8\. 'Svadhâ and reverence to Yama A<u>n</u>giras.'

9\. Then let him offer balls of rice as (ordained) before (in Sûtra 3)
on the three mounds of earth (adjacent to the three trenches).

10\. After having filled the three trenches with

\[3. This must be done with the Mantra, 'This is for you.' (Nand.)
Regarding this Mantra, see note on Sûtra 10.

4\. The 'imperishable water,' akshayyodakam, derives its name from the
Mantra, with which it is delivered, expressing the wish that the meal
'may give imperishable satisfaction' (akshayyam astu). This is the
explanation which Nand. gives of the term akshayyodakam in his gloss on
LXXIII, 27. In his comment on the present Sûtra he says that the
'imperishable water' must be presented with the (further?) Mantras, 'Let
arrive' and 'Be satisfied.' See Y. I, 251 Sâ<u>n</u>kh. IV, 2, 6.

10\. The whole Mantra runs as follows, 'This is for you, father,

{footnote p. 85 and for those after you.' But in the present case (at a
'first Srâddha') the name of the deceased has to be substituted for the
word 'father.' (Nand.) Although Nand. quotes this Mantra from
Âsvalâyana's Srauta-sûtra, it seems probable that the author of the
Vishnu-sûtra took it from the Kâthaka (IX, 6 of the Berlin MS.)\] {p.
85}

rice, sour milk, clarified butter, honey, and meat, let him mutter (the
Mantra), 'This is for you.'

11\. This ceremony he must repeat monthly, on the day of his death.

12\. At the close of the year let him give food to the Brâhma*n*as,
after having fed the gods first, in honour of the deceased and of his
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.

13\. At (the Ekoddish*t*a belonging to) this ceremony let him perform
the burnt-offering, the invitation, and (the offering of) water for
washing the feet.

14\. Then he must pour the water for washing the feet and the Arghya
(water libation) destined for the deceased person into the three vessels
containing the water for washing the feet, and the three other vessels
containing the Arghya of his three ancestors. At the same time he must
mutter

\[11. The Sûtras following next refer to the Sapi*nd*îkara*n*a or
'ceremony of investing a dead person with the rights of a Sapinda.'

12\. 'He must invite six Brâhma*n*as altogether, four as representatives
of the deceased person and of his three ancestors, two for the offering
to be addressed to the Vi*s*vedevâs. The Brâhma*n*a, who represents the
deceased person, must be fed according to the rule of the Ekoddish*t*a,
and the three Brâhmanas, who represent the three ancestors, must be fed
according to the rule of the Pârva*n*a *S*râddha, as laid down in
Chapter LXXXIII.' (Nand.)

13\. The import of this Sûtra is, that those three ceremonies must not
be omitted in the present case, as is otherwise the case at an
Ekoddish*t*a. (Nand.)

14\. <sup>1</sup> The following is a translation of the whole of this
Mantra, {footnote p. 85} which is quoted at full in the Kâ*th*aka
G*ri*hya-sûtra, 'May P*ri*thivî (the earth), Vâyu (air), Agni (fire),
and Pra*g*âpati (the lord of creatures) unite thee with thy ancestors,
and way you ancestors unite with him.' Regarding the particular
ancestors implied here, see below, LXXV.--<sup>2</sup> Rig-veda X, 191,
4.\]

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

(the two Mantras), 'May earth unite thee <sup>\[1\]</sup>,' and 'United
your minds<sup>\[2\]</sup>.'

15\. Near the leavings he must make (and put) four balls of rice.

16\. Let him show out the Brâhma*n*as, after they have sipped water duly
and have been presented by him with their sacrificial fee.

17\. Then let him knead together the ball of the deceased person with
the three balls (of the three ancestors), as (he has mixed up) his water
for washing the feet and his Arghya (with theirs).

18\. Let him do the same (with the balls placed) near the three
trenches.

19\. Or (see Sûtra 12) the Sapi*nd*îkara*n*a must be performed on the
thirteenth, after the monthly *S*râddha has been performed on the
twelfth<sup>\[1\]</sup> day.

20\. For *S*ûdras it should be performed on the twelfth day, without
Mantras.

21\. If there be an intercalary month in that year, he must add one day
to the (regular days of the) monthly *S*râddha.

22\. The ceremony of investing women with the relationship of Sapi*nd*a
has to be performed in the same manner. Later, he must perform a
*S*râddha every year, while he lives, (on the anniversary of the
deceased relative's death)<sup>\[1\]</sup>.

\[19. <sup>1</sup> I.e. on that day on which the period of impurity
expires. (Nand.)

22\. <sup>1</sup> The meaning is, that he must give him food and water,
as prescribed in 23. (Nand.)\]

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

23\. He, for whom the ceremony of investing him with the, relationship
of Sâpi*nd*a is performed after the lapse of a year, shall be honoured
by the gift, (on each day) of that year, of food and a jar with water to
a Brâhma*n*a.
