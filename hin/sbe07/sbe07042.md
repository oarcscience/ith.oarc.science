# XL.

1\. Receiving anything from a (Mle*kkh*a or other) despicable person
(even though not as a present, but in the form of interest, &c.),
traffic (even with articles that are not forbidden to sell), subsisting
by money-lending (even without exceeding the legitimate rate of
interest), telling lies (even though not in giving evidence), and
serving a Sûdra (even though without doing servile acts for him) are
crimes rendering unworthy to receive alms.

2\. He who has committed a crime rendering unworthy to receive alms, is
purified by the penance Taptak*rikkh*ra (in case he committed it
knowingly), or by the penance Sîtak*rikkh*ra (in case he did it
unawares), or by the penance Mahâsântapana (in case it was committed)
repeatedly.
