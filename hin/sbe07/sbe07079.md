# LXXVII.

1\. The sun's passage from one sign of the zodiac, to another;

2\. The two equinoctial points;

3\. The two solstitial points particularly;

4\. The (Yoga) Vyatîpâta;

5\. The constellation under which (the sacrificer himself, or his wife,
or his son) is born;

6\. A time of rejoicing (as, when a son has been born, or another happy
event happened):

7\. These occasions for a *S*râddha the lord of creatures has pronounced
optional; a *S*râddha which is performed on these occasions gives
infinite satisfaction (to the manes).

8\. No *S*râddha must be performed in the twilight or at night by an
intelligent man. A *S*râddha may be performed at those times also when
an eclipse (of the sun or of the moon) takes place.

9\. For a *S*râddha which is offered them at the time of an eclipse
satisfies the manes, as long as the moon and the stars exist, and
procures immense advantages and the satisfaction of all his desires to
the sacrificer.

\[LXXVII. 1-6, 9. Y. I, 217, 218.--6. Â*s*v. IV, 7, 1; *S*â<u>n</u>kh.
IV, 4.--8. M. III, 280; Âpast, II, 7, 17, 23, 25.

4\. This is the seventeenth among the twenty-seven Yogas or astrological
divisions of the zodiac. (Nand.)

7\. The meaning is, that the *S*râddhas mentioned in the chapter are
naimittika, 'occasional.' (Nand.)\]
