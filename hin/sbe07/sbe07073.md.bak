1\. 'This chapter treats of the duties of a Snâtaka (see XXVIII, 42,
note). The particle atha, 'now,' however, signifies that some of these
duties are common to the Snâtaka and to the householder, whose special
duties have been treated in the previous chapters. (Nand.)\]

\[2. The particle *k*a refers to ugly persons and the rest, enumerated

8\. The use of the particle *k*a implies, according to Nand., that his
frame of mind and his speech should also be in conformity with his age,
&c., as ordained by Manu IV, 18.

13-16. Nand., arguing from texts of Baudhâyana and of Manu (IV, 36),
takes the use of the particle *k*a in Sûtras 13 and 14 to {footnote p.
226} imply that a Snâtaka must wear three garments, an under garment, an
upper garment, and a mantle, and in Sûtra 16, that he must carry about
him a bushel of Ku*s*a grass.\]

by a tree or a post, an upper garment or a piece of cloth, in order to
ward off the rays of the sun.

20\. The particle *k*a here is used, according to Nand., in order to
include 'the sun, while it is eclipsed,' as mentioned by Manu IV, 37.

49\. Nor (must he give him) the leavings of his food, nor the residue of
an oblation (unless he is his own servant);

\[46. Besides the above interpretation of the term bâlâtapa, which is
proposed by Kullûka also (on M. IV, 69), Nand. mentions two others: i.
the heat of that time of the day when the cows are collected for
milking; 2. the heat of the autumn season. The particle *k*a, according

63\. He must not endeavour to please overbearing men (by flattering
their pretensions).

64\. He must not dwell in a kingdom governed by a *S*ûdra king;

\[54. Nand. states that this rule does not contain a vain repetition of
the rule laid down above (LVII, 10), as the latter refers to
householders and the former to Snâtakas.\]

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

82\. (He must strike) him upon his back with a shoot of bamboo or with a

Vi*g*ñâne*s*vara, on Yâ*g*ñavalkya I, 153.

7 9. See XXIII, 51.\]

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

particle *k*a implies.' (Nand.) See Manu VI, 37.

85\. The use of the particle *k*a, Nand. argues from Manu IV, 176,
implies that acts which may cause future pain should also be avoided.

88\. The use of the particle *k*a, according to Nand., implies that he
must also observe auspicious rites and established customs, as ordained
by Manu IV, 145. The latter injunction is, however, expressly given in
the next Sûtra.\]
