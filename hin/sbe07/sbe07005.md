2\. To protect his people,

\[14. According to Nand., the use of the term sarva, 'all,' implies that
*S*ûdras may also follow the occupations of a Vai*s*ya, tillage and the
rest, as ordained by Devala.

16\. The term Guru, 'superior,' generally denotes the parents and the
teacher, or Guru in the narrower sense of the term; see XXXI, 1, 2. It

3\. And to keep the four castes and the four orders<sup>\[1\]</sup> in
the practice of their several duties.

4\. Let the king fix his abode in a district containing open plains, fit
for cattle, and abounding in grain;

5\. And inhabited by many Vaisyas and *S*ûdras.

6\. There let him reside in a stronghold (the strength of which
consists) either in (its being surrounded by) a desert, or in (a throng
of) armed

\[3. <sup>1</sup> Of student, householder, hermit, and ascetic.

5\. 'And there should be many virtuous men in it, as stated by Manu,
VII, 69.' (Nand.)\]

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

men, or in fortifications (of stone, brick, or others), or in water
(enclosing it on all sides), or in trees, or in mountains (sheltering it
against a foreign invasion).

every village;

8\. Also, lords of every ten villages;

villages;

13\. If he too is unable, let him announce it to the lord of a hundred
villages;

14\. If he too is unable, let him announce it to the lord of the whole
district.

15\. The lord of the whole district must eradicate the evil to the best
of his power.

16\. Let the king appoint able officials for the working of his mines,
for the levying of taxes and of the fares to be paid at ferries, and for
his elephants and forests.

17\. (Let him appoint) pious persons for performing acts of piety (such
as bestowing gifts on the indigent, and the like);

18\. Skilled men for financial business (such as examining gold and
other precious metals);

\[11. See 67 and Dr. Bühler's note on Âpast. II, 10, 26, 8.

16\. The term nâgavana, which has been translated as a Dvandva compound,
denoting elephants and forests, may also be taken to mean 'forests in
which there are elephants;' or nâga may mean 'situated in the mountains'
or I a mountain fort.' (Nand.)

18\. Or, 'he must appoint men skilled in logic as his advisers in knotty
points of argument.' (Nand.)\]

26\. Let him not levy any tax upon Brâhma*n*as.

30\. And a twentieth part of (the price of) goods (sold) in another
country.

31\. Any (seller or buyer) who (fraudulently) avoids a toll-house
(situated on his road), shall lose all his goods.

\[23. This rule relates to *S*yâmâka grain and other sorts of grain
produced in the rainy season. (Nand.)

25\. 'Haradatta says that "a sixth part" means "a sixtieth part." But
this is wrong, as shown by M. VII, 131.' (Nand.) Haradatta's false
interpretation was most likely called forth by Gaut. X, 2 7.\]

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

32\. Artizans (such as blacksmiths), manual labourers (such as
carpenters), and *S*ûdras shall do work for the king for a day in each

division, presents, and force of arms.

39\. Let him have resort, as the time demands, to (the six measures of a
military monarch, viz.) making alliance and waging war, marching to
battle and sitting encamped, seeking the protection (of a more powerful
king) and distributing his forces.

\[32. According to Nand., the particle *k*a, 'and,' implies that servile
persons, who get their substance from their employers, are also implied.
See Manu VII, 138.

35\. The particle *k*a, according to Nand., is used in order to include
the kingdoms of an ally and of a neutral prince.

38\. <sup>1</sup> The term madhyama has been rendered according to
Nand.'s and Kullûkâ's (on M. VII, 156) interpretation of it. Kullâka,
however, adds, as a further characteristic, that it denotes a prince,
who is equal in strength to one foe, but no match for two when allied.\]

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

a prince of the royal race of that country with the royal dignity.

set out in the month Phâlguna.\]

or in a fort) doors which had been built there before his time (by a
former king).

64\. The man who falsely claims property hidden by another to have been
hidden by himself, shall be

\[63. This rule refers to a treasure, which has been found by some one
and announced to the king. -The original owner is bound to prove his
ownership. (Nand.) See "M. VIII, 35.\]

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

condemned to pay a fine equal in amount to the property falsely claimed
by him.

74\. Let the king appoint as judges men of good

\[70. 'The science of what is useful in life' comprises the fine arts,
except music, and all technical knowledge.

74\. According to Nand., the particle *k*a indicates that the judges
should be well acquainted, likewise, with the sacred revelation,
{footnote p. 21} and intent upon performing their daily study of the
Veda, as ordained by Yâ*g*ñavalkya, II, 2.\]

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

families, for whom the ceremonies (of initiation and so forth) have been
performed, and who are eager in keeping religious vows, impartial

upon a piece of (cotton) cloth, or a copper-plate, and must contain the
names of his (three) immediate ancestors, a declaration of the extent of
the land, and an imprecation against him who should appropriate the

\[75. According to Nand., the particle ka indicates that the king's
ministers should also consult the astrologers.

76\. 'The particle ka is used here in order to imply that the king
should bestow presents upon the Brâhma*n*as, as Ordained by Manu, VII,
79.' (Nand.) See Introduction.

82\. The repeated use of the particle *k*a in this Sûtra signifies that
the document in question should also contain the name of the {footnote
p. 22} donor, the date of the donation, and the words, written in the
donor's own hand, 'What has been written above, by that is my own will
declared.' The term dâna*kkh*edopavar*n*anam, 'containing a declaration
of the punishment awaiting the robber of a grant,' may also mean,
'indicating the boundaries (such as fields and the like) of the grant.'
The seal must contain the figure of a flamingo, boar, or other animal.
(Nand.) Numerous grants on copper-plates, exactly corresponding to the
above description, have been actually found in divers parts of India.
See, particularly, Dr. Burnell's Elements of South Indian
Palaeography.\]

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

donation to himself, and should be signed with his own seal.

90\. Let him not frown even upon (criminals) doomed to capital
punishment.

91\. Let him inflict punishments, corresponding to the nature of their
offences, upon evil-doers.

\[83. According to Nand., the particle *k*a is used in order to include
in this prohibition a grant made by himself.

86\. Nand. proposes a second interpretation of the term sudar*s*ana
besides the one given above, 'he shall often show himself before those
desirous of seeing him.' {footnote p. 23} IV. 1-14. M. VIII, 132-138; Y.
I, 361-365.\]

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

92\. Let him inflict punishments according to justice (either personally
or through his attendants).

93\. Let him pardon no one for having offended twice.

94\. He who deviates from his duty must certainly not be left unpunished
by the king.

95\. Where punishment with a black hue and a red eye advances with
irresistible might, the king deciding causes justly, there the people
will prosper.

96\. Let a king in his own domain inflict punishments according to
justice, chastise foreign foes with rigour, behave without duplicity to
his affectionate friends, and with lenity to Brâhma*n*as.

97\. Of a king thus disposed, even though he subsist by gleaning, the
fame is far spread in the world, like a drop of oil in the water.

98\. That king who is pleased when his subjects are joyful, and grieved
when they are in grief, will obtain fame in this world, and will be
raised to a high station in heaven after his death.
