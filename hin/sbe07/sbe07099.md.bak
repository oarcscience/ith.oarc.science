# XCVII.

1\. Sitting with the feet stretched out and crossed so as to touch the
thighs, with the right hand (stretched out and) resting upon the left,
with the tongue fixed in the palate, and without bringing the one row of
teeth in contact with the other, with the eyes directed to the tip of
the nose, and without glancing at any of the (four) quarters of the sky,
free from fear, and with composure, let him meditate upon (Purusha), who
is separate from the twenty-four entities,

\[XCVII. 1. Y. III, 198-200.--9. Y. III, 111, 201. This chapter treats
of the means for obtaining that knowledge of the Âtman or Self, which
has been declared at the end of the last chapter to be the road to final
emancipation. (Nand.)

1\. 'The twenty-four (it should be twenty-five) entities are stated in
the *S*â<u>n</u>khya to consist of the root-principle (mûlaprak*ri*ti),
the seven productions evolved from it (vik*ri*taya*h*), the sixteen
productions evolved from these, and Purusha (the soul), who is neither
producer nor produced. (1) The "root-principle" is composed of the three
qualities in equipoise: sattva, ragas, and tamas (the most accurate
rendering of these terms is perhaps that proposed by Elliot, "pure
unimpassioned virtue," "passion," and "depravity inclining to evil." See
Fitz-Edward Hall, Preface to *S*â<u>n</u>khyaprava*k*anabhâshya, p. 44
(2) The "great entity" (Mahat) is the cause of apprehension. (3) The
"self-consciousness" (aha*m*kâra) is the cause of {p.188} referring all
objects to self. (4-2) The "subtile elementary particles" (tanmâtras)
are identical with sound, tangibility, form, taste, and odour. (9-19)
The eleven senses (i. e. the organs of perception and action enumerated
in CXVI, 94, 95, and manas, "the mind"), and (20-24) the five "grosser
elements" (ether, air, fire, water, and earth) are productions (from the
former entities). Purusha, who is neither producer nor produced, is the
twenty-fifth entity.' (Nand.)\]

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

2\. He who is eternal, beyond the cognisance of the senses, destitute of
qualities, not concerned with sound, tangibility, form, savour, or
odour, knowing everything, of immense size,

3\. He who pervades everything, and who is devoid of form,

4\. Whose hands and feet are everywhere, whose eyes, head, and face are
everywhere, and who is able to apprehend everything with all the senses.

5\. Thus let him meditate.

6\. If he remains absorbed in such meditation for a year, he obtains the
accomplishment of Yoga (concentration of the thought and union with the
Supreme).

7\. If he is unable to fix his mind upon the being

\[2, 3. According to Nand., all the properties of Purusha mentioned in
this Sûtra are such as distinguish him from the rest of the entities,
the first two distinguishing him from 'self-consciousness' (aha*m*kâra),
the voidness of quality distinguishing him from the 'root-principle'
(mûlaprak*ri*ti), which is composed of three qualities, &c.

4\. The properties of Pûrusha here mentioned are faculties only, so that
there is no contradiction to the 'voidness of form' and the other
properties enumerated in the preceding Sûtras. (Nand.)

6\. The external signs of the accomplishment of Yoga, as stated by
Yâ*g*ñavalkya (III, 202 seq.), are, the faculty of entering another body
and of creating anything at will, and other miraculous powers and
qualities. (Nand.)\]

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

destitute of form<sup>\[1\]</sup>, he must meditate successively on
earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect, self<sup>\[2\]</sup>,
the indiscrete<sup>\[3\]</sup>, and Purusha<sup>\[4\]</sup>: having
fully apprehended one, he must dismiss it from his thoughts and fix his
mind upon the next one in order.

8\. In this way let him arrive at meditation upon Purusha.

9\. If unable to follow this method also, he must meditate on Purusha
shining like a lamp in his heart, as in a lotus turned upside down.

10\. If he cannot do that either, he must meditate upon Bhagavat
Vâsudeva (Vish*n*u), who is adorned with a diadem, with ear-rings, and
with bracelets, who has the (mystic mark) *S*rîvatsa and a garland of
wood-flowers on his breast, whose aspect is pleasing, who has four arms,
who holds the shell, the discus, the mace, and the lotus-flower, and
whose feet are supported (and worshipped) by the earth.

11\. Whatever he meditates upon, that is obtained by a man (in a future
existence): such is the mysterious power of meditation.

12\. Therefore must he dismiss everything perishable

\[7. <sup>1</sup> The term nirâkâra, 'the being destitute of form,'
evidently refers to Purusha here (cf. Sûtra 3), though Nand. interprets
it as an epithet of 'Brahman.'--<sup>2</sup> Intellect' (buddhi) and
'self' (âtman), according to Nand., mean 'the great entity' (mahat) and
'self-consciousness' (aha*m*kâra), cf. note on Sûtra 1.--<sup>3</sup>
'The indiscrete' (avyaktam) means 'the chief one' (pradhânam), i. c. the
*S*â<u>n</u>khya 'root-principle' (see XCVI, 96).--<sup>4</sup> Nand.
takes Purusha, in this Sûtra and in 13, 15 to mean 'the twenty-sixth
entity;' but it appears clearly from Sûtra 1, as from 16 also, that the
Vish*n*u-sûtra, like the *S*â<u>n</u>khya system, assumes twenty-five
entities only, not twenty-six, like Yama, upon whose authority Nand.'s
statement is based.

9\. <sup>1</sup> Nand. interprets the term Purusha here by âtman.
'self.'\]

from his thoughts and meditate upon what is imperishable only.

13\. There is nothing imperishable except Purusha.

14\. Having become united with him (through constant meditation), he
obtains final liberation.

15\. Because the great lord pervades the whole universe (pura), as he is
lying there (*s*ete), therefore is he denominated Puru-sha by those who
reflect upon the real nature (of the Supreme Spirit).

16\. In the first part and the latter part of the night must a man bent
on contemplation constantly and with fixed attention meditate upon
Purusha Vish*n*u, who is destitute of (the three) qualities (sattva,
ra*g*as, and tamas<sup>\[1\]</sup>) and the twenty-fifth entity.

17\. He (or it) is composed of the entities, beyond the cognisance of
the senses, distinct from all the (other) entities, free from attachment
(to the producer, &c.), supporting everything, devoid of qualities and
yet enjoying (or witnessing the effect of) qualities.

18\. It exists without and within created beings (as being enjoyed and
as enjoyer), and in the shape both of immovable things (such as trees or
stones) and of movable things (such as water or fire); it is
undistinguishable on account of its subtlety; it is out of reach
(imperceptible), and yet is found in the heart.

\[16. <sup>1</sup> See Sûtra 1, note.

17\. Thus according to the reading asaktam, which is mentioned and
explained as a var. lect. by Nand. He himself reads a*s*aktam,
'independent of *S*akti, power, i. e. the producer, the power of
creation (prak*ri*ti), or illusion (mâyâ).' Mâyâ and prakriti are
occasionally used as synonymous terms in the Sâ<u>n</u>khya.\]

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

19\. It is not distinct from creation, and yet distinct from it in
outward appearance; it annihilates and produces by turns (the world),
which consists of everything that has been, that will be, and that is.

20\. It is termed the light of the sidereal bodies and the enemy of
darkness (ignorance), it is knowledge, it should be known, it may be
understood (by meditation), it dwells in every man's heart.

21\. Thus the 'field,' knowledge (or meditation), and what should be
known<sup>\[1\]</sup> have been concisely declared; that faithful
adherent of mine who makes himself acquainted therewith, becomes united
to me in spirit.
