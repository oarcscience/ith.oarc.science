# LXXXVIII.

1\. A cow in the act of bringing forth a young one is (comparable to)
the earth.

2\. By bestowing such a cow upon a Brâhma*n*a, after having decked her
with ornaments, he obtains the same reward as if he were to bestow the
earth (upon him),

\[6. <sup>1</sup> See LXVIII, 6, note. LXXXVIII. 1. Y. I, 207.--4. Y. I,
206.\]

3\. There is a stanza in regard to this subject:

4\. 'One who full of faith and with intense application of mind gives
away a pregnant cow, enters heaven for as many Yugas (or ages of the
world) as that cow and her calf together have hairs on their bodies.'
