XXIII, 2; XXVI, 1-5, 20.--24, 25. M. XI, 224, 225.

9\. <sup>1</sup> Nand. thinks that the word iti, 'thus,' has a double
meaning {footnote p. 150} here, and refers to another kind of
Aghamarshana penance at the same time, which is described by
*S*a<u>n</u>kha, and consists simply in fasting for three days and
muttering the Aghamarsha*n*a hymn three times.\]

10\. Let a man for three days eat in the evening only; for other three

11\. Let him drink for three days hot water; for other three days, hot
clarified butter; and for further three days, hot milk; and let him fast
for three days: that is the Taptak*rikkh*ra (hot penance).

12\. Taking the same (liquids) cold is called the *S*îtak*rikkh*ra (cold
penance).

13\. The K*rikkh*râtik*rikkh*ra (the most difficult penance) consists in
subsisting on milk only for twenty-one days.

14\. Eating (nothing but) ground barley mixed with water for a whole

in which Ku*s*a grass has been boiled, and fasting the next day, is
called Sântapana (the tormenting penance).

20\. Swallowing (the same six things, viz.) cow-urine and the rest, each

penance).

21\. Swallowing each for three days is called Atisântapana (the
extremely tormenting penance).

22\. Swallowing oil-cakes, foam of boiled rice, buttermilk, water, and
ground barley (each for one day), with a fasting day between (every, two
days), is called Tulâpurusha (a man's weight).

23\. Drinking water boiled with Kusa grass, leaves of the Palâsa and
Udumbara trees, of lotuses, of the *S*a<u>n</u>khapushpî plant, of the
banyan tree, and of the Brahmasuvar*k*alâ plant, each (for one day), is
called Par*n*ak*rikkh*ra (leaves penance).

24\. Let a man perform all those penances after having shorn his hair
and his beard, and let him bathe at morning, noon, and evening every
day, lying on a low couch, and restraining his passions,

25\. And let him (while engaged in performing them) avoid to converse
with women, *S*ûdras, or outcasts, and let him constantly, to the best
of his ability, mutter purifying Ma*n*tras and make oblations in the
fire.
