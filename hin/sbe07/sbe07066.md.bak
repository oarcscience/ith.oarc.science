# LXIV.

1\. He must not bathe in another man's pool;

2\. In cases of distress (if there is no other water at hand) he may
bathe (in another man's pool), after having offered up five (or seven,
or four) lumps of clay and (three jars with) water.

3\. (He must not bathe) during an indigestion;

4\. Nor while he is afflicted (with a fever or other illness);

5\. Nor without his clothes; 6. Nor at night; 7. Unless it be during an
eclipse; 8. Nor in the twilight.

9, He must bathe early in the morning, when he beholds the east
reddening with the rays of the (rising) sun.

10\. After having bathed, he must not shake his head (in order to remove
the water from his hair);

11\. And he must not dry his limbs (with his hand or with a cloth);

12\. Nor must he touch any oily substance.

\[LXIV. I. M. IV, 201.--1, 2. Y. I, 159-3, 4. M. IV, 129.--5. M. IV, 45;
Gaut. IX, 61; Â*s*v. III, 9, 6; Pâr. II, 7, 6; *S*â<u>n</u>kh. IV, 12,
31.--6. M. IV, 129.--12. M. IV, 83.--13, *S*â<u>n</u>kh. IV, 12,
32.--15. Gaut. IX, 16.--16. M. IV, 263; Y. I, 159.--24. M. IV, 152; Y.
I, 100.--27. Y. I, 196.

5\. The term nagna, literally 'naked,' has to be taken in its widest
sense here. According to Bh*ri*gu and Gobhila it includes, besides one
wholly undressed, 'one without his upper garment, one who has dirty
clothes on, one clad in lower garments of silk only, one who wears
double clothing or even a greater number of clothes, one who wears a
small piece of cloth over the pudenda only,' &c. (Nand.) See also M. IV,
129.\]

13\. He must not put on again the garment which he wore before, without
its having been washed.

14\. After having bathed, he must cover with his head a
turban<sup>\[1\]</sup> and put on two garments<sup>\[2\]</sup> washed
(by himself).

15\. He must not converse, (after having bathed,) with barbarians,
low-caste persons, or outcasts.

16\. He must bathe in cascades, ponds dug by the gods, and lakes.

17\. Stagnant water is more pure (and purifies more effectually) than
water taken out (of a well or the like); the water of a spring is more
pure than that of a tank; the water of a river is more pure than the
former; water collected by (Vasish*th*a or some other) devout
sage<sup>\[1\]</sup> is even more pure; but the water of the Ganges is
the purest of all.

19\. After having removed the dirt by means of earth and
water<sup>\[1\]</sup>, and after having dived under water and returned
(to the bank of the river), he must address the bathing-place with the
three Mantras (beginning with the words), 'Ye waters
are<sup>\[2\]</sup>,'with the four Mantras (beginning with the words),

\[14. <sup>1</sup> Ush*n*îsha, 'a turban,' here denotes a bandage used
for drying the head, which is wrapped around the head and closely tied
together.--<sup>2</sup> I. e. an upper and an under garment. (Nand.)

16\. The term devakhâta, 'ponds dug by the gods,' refers to Pushkara and
other holy bathing-places. (Nand.) See below LXXXV.

17\. <sup>1</sup> Nand. cites Vasish*th*aprâkî and Vi*s*vâmitraprâ*k*î
as instances of holy bathing-places of this description.

18\. <sup>1</sup> Nand. refers this and the following Sûtras to a midday
bath, because a verse, which he quotes, forbids the use of earth (in
order to clean one's self with it) in the morning bath. But it seems to
follow from 35 and 42, that an the rules given in this chapter refer to
that bath, which must be taken at sunrise every day.--<sup>2</sup> Rig
{footnote p. 206} veda X, 9, 1-3, &c.--<sup>3</sup> Taitt. Sa*m*h. V, 6,
1, 1-2, &c.--<sup>4</sup> Rig-veda I, 23, 22, &c.\]

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

'The golden-coloured (waters)<sup>\[3\]</sup>,' and with (the one Mantra
beginning with the words), 'Carry away (all), that, O ye
waters<sup>\[4\]</sup>.'

19\. Then he must dive underwater and mutter the Aghamarshana three
times;

20\. Or (he must mutter three times the Mantra which begins with the
words), 'That most exalted step of Vish*n*u;'

21\. Or the Drupadâ Sâvitrî (which begins with the words, 'Like one
released from a post);

22\. Or the Anuvâka (which begins with the words), 'They get their minds
ready;'

23\. Or the Purushasûkta.

24\. After having bathed, he must feed the gods and the manes, while
standing in the water with his wet clothes on.

25\. If (being unable to remain in water after having bathed) he has
changed his dress, (he must feed the gods and the manes,) after having
crossed the bathing-place (and reached the bank).

26\. (But) he must not wring his bathing-dress till he has satisfied the
gods and the manes.

2 7. After having bathed<sup>\[1\]</sup> and sipped water, he must sip
water (once more) according to the rule.

28\. He must offer (sixteen) flowers to Purusha,

\[20. Rig-veda I, 22, 20, &c.

21\. Taitt. Brâhm. II, 4, 4, 9; 6, 6, 3; cf. Vâ*g*asan. Sa*m*h. XX, 20;
Atharva-veda VI, 115, 3.

22\. Rig-veda V, 81, &c.

24\. 'The use of the particle *k*a indicates that he must anoint himself
after having bathed.' (Nand.)

27\. 'This expression refers back to the whole proceeding described
above, up to the wringing of the bathing-dress. (Nand.)\]

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

while muttering the Purushasûkta, one with each verse.

29\. Afterwards (he must offer) a libation of water.

30\. He must first offer one to the gods with the Tîrtha sacred to the
gods.

31\. Then he must offer an other to the manes with the Tîrtha sacred to
the manes.

32\. In offering the latter he must first of all feed (the manes of) his
next of kin (such as his father, mother, maternal grandfather, uncles,
brothers, &c.)

33\. After that (he must feed) his relatives (such as a sister's son, a
father-in-law, a brother-in-law, &c.) and distant kinsmen (such as the
sons of his father's sisters and of his mother's sisters).

34\. Then (he must feed) his (deceased) friends.

35\. According, to the above rule he must bathe every day.

36\. After having bathed, he must mutter as many purifying Mantras as
possible.

37\. And he must mutter the Gâyatrî even more often (than other
Mantras);

38\. And the Purushasûkta.

39\. There is nothing more sublime than those two (prayers).

40\. One who has bathed is thereby entitled to perform the offerings to
the Vi*s*vedevâs and to the manes, to mutter sacred texts, and to
exercise the duty of hospitality, as prescribed by law.

\[30, 31. See LXII, 3, 4.

37, 38. 'Or the meaning of these two Sûtras is, that the Gâyatrî and the
Purushasûkta always have to be muttered besides the other Mantras.'
(Nand.)

40\. Nand. refers the term vidhinodite to a separate duty, that
{footnote p. 208} of worshipping the gods; the particle *k*a to the
propitiation of the planets by sacrifices and other such duties; and the
particle tathâ to optional acts, such as the gift of a cow to a
Brâhma*n*a, and the like. But this is certainly a too extensive
interpretation of the text.\]

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

41\. Distress and misfortune, bad dreams and evil thoughts are taken
from him even who only sprinkles himself with water (no matter from
where it comes): that is the law.

42\. He who regularly takes the prescribed bath (every morning), does
not experience the tortures of Yama's hell. By the regular bath
criminals even obtain their absolution.
