1\. Now follow the penances for secret sins.

\[30. For the Atik*rikkh*ra penance, see M. XI, 214.

33\. <sup>1</sup> Nand. adds, that a youth under the age of sixteen, who
has not been initiated, and old women, as well as girls who have not yet
attained maturity, must only perform a quarter of it, as directed in a
Sm*ri*ti.

LV\. 1. M. XI, 248; Y. III, 301; Gaut. XXIV, 1.--2, 3. M. XI, 249, 260;

2\. The killer of a Brâhma*n*a is purified, if, having approached a
river (and bathed in it), he restrains his breath sixteen times, and
takes only one meal, consisting of food fit for offerings, each day, for
a month.

3\. At the end of this rite he must give a milch cow.

4\. By performing the same rite and by muttering (while standing in the
water) the Aghamarsha*n*a<sup>\[1\]</sup> (instead of stopping his
breath), a drinker of spirituous liquor\[2\] becomes free from sin.

5\. (By performing the same rite and) muttering the Gâyatrî one thousand
and ten times (each day), a stealer of gold becomes free from guilt.

6\. One who has connection with a Guru's wife<sup>\[1\]</sup> (becomes
free from sin) by fasting for three days and muttering the
Purushasûkta<sup>\[2\]</sup> and (at the same time) offering a
burnt-oblation.

7\. Even as the horse-sacrifice, the king of sacrifices, removes all
sin, the hymn of Aghamarsha*n*a likewise removes all sin.

8\. Let a twice-born man stop his breath, in order to rid himself of all
sin; all sins committed by a

\[2. Nand. infers from a text of Manu (XI, 249), that this rule refers
to one who has killed a Brâhma*n*a intentionally.

3\. This rule, Nand. infers from a passage of Yâ*g*ñavalkya (III, 305),
applies also to the penances mentioned in the following Sûtra.

4\. <sup>1</sup> Rig-veda X, 190.--<sup>2</sup> 'I. e. one who has
knowingly drunk it, the penance for drinking it unknowingly being stated
by Yâ*g*ñavalkya (III, 304).' (Nand.)

5, 6. <sup>1</sup> Nand. infers from M. XI, 251, 252, that these two
Sûtras also refer to penances for crimes intentionally
committed.--<sup>2</sup> Rig-veda X, 90.\]

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

twice-born man may be removed by repeated Prâ*n*âyâmas.

9\. It is called a Prâ*n*âyâma, if a man, stopping the breath (which
comes from the mouth and from the nostrils), recites the Gâyatrî three
times, together with the Vyâh*ri*tis ('words')<sup>\[1\]</sup>, with the
sacred syllable Om, and with the (text called) *S*iras<sup>\[2\]</sup>.

10\. The lord of creatures (Brahman) has milked out from the three Vedas
the letter A, the letter U, and the letter M (of which the sacred
syllable Om is composed), and (the three sacred words) Bhû*h*, Bhuva*h*,
Sva*h* (earth, the atmosphere, and heaven).

11\. The lord of creatures, the supreme deity, has also milked out from
the three Vedas successively the three verses of the sacred stanza which
begins with the word 'tad,' and is called Sâvitrî (or Gâyatrî).

12\. By muttering, every morning and evening, that syllable and that
stanza, preceded by the three 'words,' a Brâhma*n*a will obtain that
religious merit which the (study of the) Veda confers, just as if he had
actually studied the Veda.

13\. By repeating those three (Om, the 'words,' and the Gâyatrî every
day) for a month out of the village, a thousand times, a twice-born man
is purified even from a mortal sin, as a snake (is freed) from its
withered skin.

14\. Any member of the Brâhma*n*a, Kshatriya, or Vai*s*ya castes, who
does not know those three texts,

\[9. <sup>1</sup> The three Vyâh*ri*tis, 'words,' or Mahâvyâh*ri*tis,
'great words,' are quoted in the next *S*loka.--<sup>2</sup> It begins
with the words, 'O ye waters, who are splendour and ambrosia.' (Nand.,
and Mitâksharâ on Y. I, 23.)\]

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

or fails to recite them in the proper season, meets with reproach among
the virtuous.

15\. The three imperishable 'great words,' preceded by the syllable Om,
and the Gâyatrî consisting of three divisions, have to be recognised as
the mouth (or beginning) of the Veda<sup>\[1\]</sup>.

16\. He who repeats that stanza (preceded by the syllable Om and the
three 'words') carefully every day for three years, will be absorbed in
the highest Brahman after death, move as freely as air, and become as
pure as air.

17\. The monosyllable (Om) is the highest Brahman, the stoppings of the
breath are the best of austerities, but nothing is more exalted than the
Gâyatrî; (declaring the) truth is better than silence.

18\. All religious acts ordained in the Veda, (whether) consisting in
burnt-oblations or sacrifices (or alms-giving or other pious
observances), perish (after the merit obtained by them has been
exhausted); but the syllable Om (akshara) must be known to be
imperishable (akshara), as it is identical with Brahman, the lord of
creatures.

19\. The act of reciting (the syllable Om, the 'words,' and the Gâyatrî)
is ten times better than the (Gyotish*t*oma or other) sacrifices
prescribed (by the Veda); it is a hundred times better when muttered in
a low voice; it is a thousand times better when repeated mentally only.

20\. The four Pâkaya*g*ñas<sup>\[1\]</sup> (small or domestic

\[15. 'To explain this, Nand. quotes a passage of Â*s*valâyana
(G*ri*hya-sûtra III, 2, 3, where, however, part only of this quotation
is found) to the effect that the study of the Veda has to be begun by
pronouncing Om, the 'words,' and the Gâyatrî.

20\. <sup>1</sup> 'The four Pâkaya*g*ñas are the offerings to gods,
goblins (or "all beings,"), manes, and men, together with the offering
to {footnote p. 184} Brahman.' (Nand.; see LIX, 20-25.) Kullûka, on the
contrary (on M. II, 86), refers the term Pâkaya*g*ña to the four first
only out of those five offerings, and this interpretation, besides being
more simple than Nand.'s, is preferable for several other reasons.
First, the 'offering to Brahman' includes the daily recitation of the
Gâyatrî, which is mentioned here as opposed to the four Pâkaya*g*ñas.
Secondly, the number of four Pâkaya*g*ñas is equally given in the
Kâ*th*aka G*ri*hya-sûtra; and Devapâla, in his Commentary on that work,
gives a definition of them, which agrees in the main with Kullûka's.
'Four' Pâkaya*g*ñas are mentioned in the G*ri*hya-sûtras of Kau*s*ika,
Pâraskara, and *S*â<u>n</u>khâyana also. See Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 48.
Thirdly, the Pâkaya*g*ñas are brought in here as opposed to the
Vidhiya*g*ñas or 'sacrifices prescribed by the Veda.' This is probably
because the latter are offered in the triad of sacred fires, whereas the
term Pâkaya*g*ña, in its narrower use, denotes the oblations offered in
the domestic fire. Hence, it might come to include the 'offering to
men,' i. e. the feeding of a guest, but certainly not the study of the
Veda.\]

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

offerings), together with the sacrifices prescribed (in the Veda),
though all united, are not equal to a sixteenth part of the sacrifice
performed by reciting (those sacred prayers).

21\. A Brâhmana may beyond doubt obtain final emancipation by solely
repeating (those prayers), whether he perform any other religious
observance or no; one who is benevolent towards all creatures (and does
not slay them for sacrifices) is justly, called a Brâhma*n*a (or one
united to Brahman).
