Now follows the (rule regarding the ordeal by) poison.

2\. All (other) sorts of poison must be avoided (in administering this
ordeal),

3\. Except poison from the *Sri*<u>n</u>ga tree, which grows on the
Himâlayas.

4\. (Of that) the judge must give seven grains, mixed with clarified
butter, to the defendant (while reciting the prayer hereafter
mentioned).

5\. If the poison is digested easily, without violent symptoms, he shall
recognise him as innocent, and dismiss him at the end of the day.

6\. 'On account of thy venomous and dangerous nature thou art
destruction to all living creatures; thou, O poison, knowest what
mortals, do not comprehend.

7\. 'This man being arraigned in a cause, desires to be cleared from
guilt. Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.'
