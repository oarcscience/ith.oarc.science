5\. Let him sip water, which has not been put to the fire and is free
from foam (and bubbles), which has not been poured out by a *S*ûdra (or
other uninitiated person), or by a man who has one hand only, and which
has no saline flavour<sup>\[1\]</sup>; and (let him sip it) in a clean
place, duly seated, placing (his right hand) between his knees, facing
the east or the north (or, the north-east), attentively regarding the
water, and in a cheerful mood.

6\. Let him sip water thrice with the Tîrtha sacred

\[17. <sup>1</sup> It must be washed both before and after using it.
(Nand.) LXII. 1-4. M. II, 59; Y. I, 19.--5-8. M. II, 60, 61; Y. I, 20;
Âpast. I, 5, 16, 1-7; Gaut. I, 36.--9. M. II, 62; Y. I, 21.

1\. Nand. observes that this chapter and the preceding one follow in
order upon Chapter LX, because the purificatory rite described at the
end of the latter is immediately followed by the Â*k*amana (sipping of
water), and then by the Dantadhâvana (cleaning the teeth), both of which
acts, however, have to be performed on other occasions also, as after a
meal, &c.

5\. 'The term kshâra, 'saline flavour,' includes bad or spoiled water of
any kind, according to Nand.\]

to Brahman (or with the Tîrthas sacred to the gods and to Pragipati
respectively).

7\. Let him wipe his lips twice (with the root of his thumb).

8\. Let him touch the cavities (above his navel)<sup>\[1\]</sup>, his
head, and his breast with water.

9\. By water which reaches either their heart, or their throat, or their
palate respectively, members of the three twice-born castes are purified
each in his turn; a woman and a *S*ûdra are purified by water which has
once touched their palate.
