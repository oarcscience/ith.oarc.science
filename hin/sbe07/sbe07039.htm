<P>1. 'But if a man who does not know all the four Vedas says, in order to procure a valuable present or some other advantage, 'I know the four Vedas,' or if he says of another, his superior in caste or sacred knowledge, in order too prevent his receiving a valuable present, 'This man is no Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a,' or 'He does not know anything,' in all such cases his crime is equal to the killing of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.' (Nand.)</P>
<P>2. 'But giving information of a heavy crime constitutes a crime equal to the killing of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.' (Nand.)</P>
<P>3. Guru means 'father' here. Heavy reproaches, as e. g. if a son says to his father, 'You have made unequal shares in dividing the patrimony,' are equal to killing a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. (Nand.)</P>
<P>4. 'But atheistical detracting from the authority of the Veda constitutes a crime equal to the drinking of spirituous liquor.' (Nand.)</P>
<P>6. The use of the particle <I>k</I>a indicates that distant relatives are also intended here, as Y&acirc;<I>g</I>&ntilde;avalkya, III, 239, states.' (Nand.)]</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[20. it is true that the above definition of an Up&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya (XXIX, 2) implies that teaching the Veda for a fee is no reprehensible act; but that permission has reference to cases of distress only. (Nand.)</P>
<P>26. Nand. asserts that the particle <I>k</I>a is used here in order to include the performance of an Ah&icirc;na sacrifice and of the other sinful acts mentioned by Manu, XI, 198.</P>
