# LIX.

1\. A householder must perform the Pâkaya*g*ñas

\[1\]

\[11. <sup>1</sup> Nand. interprets the term pâr*s*vika by 'moving a
chowrie to and fro before one's master, while standing by his side.'

1\. <sup>1</sup> The term Pâkaya*g*ña is used in a more restricted sense
here than above (LV, 20). Nand. interprets it by 'Vai*s*vadeva,
{footnote p. 191} Sthâlîpâka, Srav*n*âkarmen, and similar sacrifices,'
i. e. all the sacrifices which have to be performed in the one household
fire, as opposed to those for which a Tretâ or triad of sacred fires is
required (see Stenzler, note on Â*s*v. I, 1, 2). Gautama (VIII, 18)
enumerates seven Pâkaya*g*ñas, among which, however, the Vai*s*vadeva is
not included. The Vai*s*vadeva is described in LXVII. Regarding the
other Pâkaya*g*ñas, see the G*ri*hya-sûtras.--<sup>2</sup> 'Or in the
fire kindled at the division of the family estate, or in the fire
kindled on his becoming master of the house.' (Nand.) See Sâ<u>n</u>kh.
I, 1, 3-5.\]

(small or domestic offerings) in the fire kindled at the time of
marriage<sup>\[2\]</sup>.

2\. He must offer the Agnihotra (or daily oblations of clarified butter)
every morning and evening (in the Tretâ fires).

3\. He must offer burnt-oblations to the gods (in case the Agnihotra
cannot be performed).

4\. Let him offer the two Dar*s*apur*n*amâsas on the days of conjunction
and opposition of the sun

and moon.

5\. Once in each half of the year, (at the two solstices, let him offer)
the Pa*s*ubandha (animal sacrifice).

6\. In autumn and summer let him offer the Âgraya*n*a (oblation of
first-fruits);

\[2. The three Tretâ fires have been enumerated above (XXXI, 8).
Regarding the Agnihotra and the sacrifices mentioned in 4-8, see Weber,
Ind. Stud. X, 328-337, 343-349, 352-396.

4\. 'One who has performed the ceremony of Agnyâdhâna (kindling the
sacred fires) must perform these two offerings in the Tretâ fires, one
who has not done so, in the household or nuptial fire.' (Nand.) This
remark applies equally to the sacrifices mentioned in 5-7.

6\. 'If the Âgraya*n*a is offered in the household fire, it must consist
of a Sthâlîpâka (cooked offering of grain).' (Nand.) See the
G*ri*hya-sûtras above cited. Nand. further explains that in autumn the
first-fruits of rice, and in summer the firstlings of {footnote p. 192}
barley, or, according to Âpastamba, of Ve*n*uyava, have to be offered,
and he infers from another text of the same author that the particle
*k*a here refers to an oblation of Syâmâka grain, which has to be
offered in the rainy season. The two passages in question are not found
in Âpastamba's Dharma-sûtra, but Weber, loc. cit., quotes them from
Kâtyâyana.\]

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

7\. Or when rice and barley are ripening (in winter and spring).

8\. He who has a sufficient supply of food for more than three years
(shall perform the Soma-sacrifice)<sup>\[1\]</sup>.

9\. (He shall perform) the Soma-sacrifice once a year (in spring).

10\. If he has not wealth (sufficient to defray the expenses of the
Pa*s*ubandha, Soma, *K*âturmâsya, and other *S*rauta sacrifices), he
shall perform the Ish*t*i Vaisvânarî.

11\. Let him not make an offering of food obtained as alms from a
*S*ûdra.

12\. If he has begged articles for a sacrifice (and obtained them), let
him employ them all for that purpose (and never for himself).

13\. Every evening and morning let him offer up the Vai*s*vadeva;

14\. And<sup>\[1\]</sup> let him give alms to an Ascetic (afterwards).

15\. For giving alms and showing due honour to the recipient (by pouring
water on his hands both before and afterwards) he obtains the same
reward as for giving a cow.

\[8. <sup>1</sup> According to Nand., the Soma-sacrifices here referred
to are of the kâmya species (offered in order to obtain the
gratification of a special desire).

14\. <sup>1</sup> Nand. infers from the use of the particle *k*a, and
from a text of Parâ*s*ara, that an injunction to give alms to a student
is also intended here.\]

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

16\. If there is no ascetic (or other person worthy to receive alms), he
must give a mouthful to cows;

17\. Or he must cast it into fire.

18\. If there is food in the house, he must not reject a mendicant, (who
arrives) after he has taken his meal himself.

19\. A householder has five places where animals are liable to be
destroyed: his wooden mortar, his slab to grind wheat or condiments
upon, his fireplace, his water-pot, and his broom.

20\. For the sake of expiating offences committed (by ignorantly
destroying life) in those places, he must perform the (five) sacrifices
addressed to the Veda, to the gods, to all created beings (or 'to the
goblins'), to the manes, and to men.

21\. Privately reciting (and teaching) the Veda is the sacrifice
addressed to the Veda.

22\. The regular burnt-oblation (Vaisvadeva) is the sacrifice addressed
to the gods.

23\. The Pit*ri*tarpana (refreshing the manes with food and water) is
the sacrifice addressed to the manes.

24\. The Bali-offering is the sacrifice addressed to all creatures (or
'to the goblins').

25\. The sacrifice addressed to men consists in honouring a guest.

26\. He who does not give their share to these five, the gods, his
guests, (his wife and children and others,) whom he is bound to
maintain, his manes, and himself, is not alive, though he breathes.

\[18. 'The expression, "if there is food in the house," indicates that
he is not bound to cook a fresh meal for his guest.' (Nand.)\]

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

27\. These (three), the student, the hermit, and the ascetic, derive
their existence from the order of householders; therefore must a
householder not treat them with disdain, when they have arrived (at his
house at the proper time for begging alms).

28\. The householder offers sacrifices, the householder practises
austerities, the householder distributes gifts; therefore is the order
of householders, the first of all.

29\. The *Ri*shis<sup>\[1\]</sup>, the manes, the gods, all creatures
(dogs, &c.), and guests beg householders for support; therefore is the
order of householders the best of all.

30\. If a householder is intent upon pursuing the three objects of life
(virtue, love, and wealth), upon constantly distributing presents of
food, upon worshipping the gods, upon honouring the Brâhma*n*as, upon
discharging his duty of privately reciting (and teaching) the Veda, and
upon refreshing the manes (with oblations of balls of rice, water, and
the like), he will attain the world of Indra.
