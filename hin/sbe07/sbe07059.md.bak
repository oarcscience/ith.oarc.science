2\. Vrâtyas (i. e. those for whom the ceremony of initiation has not

3\. Outcasts;

4\. Descendants within the third degree' of an outcast mother or father,

5\. (As a rule) the food of all such persons must not be eaten, nor
gifts be accepted from them,<sup>\[1\]</sup>.

6\. He must avoid accepting repeated gifts from those whose presents
must not be accepted<sup>\[1\]</sup>.

7\. By accepting such gifts, Brâhma*n*as lose their divine lustre.

8\. And he who, not knowing the law regarding acceptance of gifts,

the unrepenting. The penances to be performed by the former having been
enumerated, he goes on in the present chapter to state that the latter
must be avoided.' (Nand.)

3\. See XXXV, 1-5.

4\. <sup>1</sup> Nand. refers the term 'in the third degree' to the
three ascendants of the parents. The same infers from a passage of
Gautama (XX, 1) that the particle *k*a is used in order to include a
murderer of a king also.

5\. <sup>1</sup> Nand. infers from another text of Gautama (XX, 8) that
it is also forbidden to converse with them.

gods) if he rejects such alms.

13\. If he wishes to provide for his (parents or other) Gurus or for
(his wife or other) such persons as he is bound to maintain, or if he
wants to worship the manes or the gods, he may accept gifts from any
one; but he must not satisfy himself with them.

14\. But even in those cases, and though he be worthy to receive
presents, let him not accept them from a dissolute woman, from a eunuch,
from an outcast, or from an enemy.

15\. And if his parents are dead, or if he is living apart from them in
a house of his own, he must never, while seeking to obtain food for
himself, accept alms from any other persons but those who are of
respectable descent (and belong to a twice-born caste).

grass &c. is likewise intended, as Yâ*g*ñavalkya (I, 214) says.' (Nand.)

16, The reason of this rule, according to Nand., lies in this, that
{footnote p. 189} all the castes mentioned in this Sûtra are not
properly Sûdras, but the offspring of unions between parents of a
different caste, herdsmen being, according to Parâ*s*ara, the offspring
of a Kshatriya with a *S*ûdra damsel, &c. The same considers the use of
the particle *k*a to imply that potters are also intended. See Gaut.
XVII, 6.\]

of all such may be eaten, although they are *S*ûdras.
