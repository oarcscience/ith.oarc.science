\[27. Nand. refers the term bhikshu, which has been rendered by
'ascetic,' i. e. a member of the fourth order, to the six sorts of
beggars enumerated by Parâ*s*ara. But as the first three orders are
mentioned in this *S*loka, it is certainly more natural to translate the
term as has been done above.

29\. <sup>1</sup> Nand. thinks that hermits or members of the third
order are meant by this term. But it seems preferable to refer it to the
*Ri*shi authors of the Veda, to whom the first of the five sacrifices,
the study of the Veda, is more immediately addressed. See Âpast. I, 4,
13, 1; Gaut. V, 3.

places (mentioned by Manu IV, 46, according to Nand.'s reading, which
differs from the traditional one) are also included in this prohibition:
a river, a mountain, the ruins of a temple, and the top of a mountain.

17\. Nand. infers from the use of the particle *k*a, and from a text of

or a (father or other) Guru, or a Brâhma*n*a;

23\. Nor without having enveloped his head;

24\. Having cleaned his hindparts with a clod of earth, or with a brick,

25\. The organ must once be cleaned with earth, the hindparts three
times, the one hand (the left) ten times, both hands together seven
times, and both feet together three times.

26\. Such is the purification ordained for householders; it is double
for students treble for hermits; and quadruple for ascetics.
