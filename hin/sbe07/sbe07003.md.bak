# VISH*N*U

## I.

1\. THE night of Brahman being over, and the God sprung from the lotus
(Brahman) having woke from his slumber, Vish*n*u purposing to create
living beings, and perceiving the earth covered with water,

2\. Assumed the shape of a boar, delighting to sport in water, as at the
beginning of each former Kalpa, and raised up the earth (from the
water).

3\. His feet were the Vedas; his tusks the sacrificial stakes; in his
teeth were the offerings; his mouth was the pyre; his tongue was the
fire; his hair was the sacrificial grass; the sacred texts were his
head; and he was (endowed with the miraculous power of) a great ascetic.

4\. His eyes were day and night; he was of superhuman nature; his ears
were the two bundles of Ku*s*a grass (for the Ish*t*is, or smaller
sacrifices, and for the animal offerings); his ear-rings were the ends
of those bundles of Ku*s*a grass (used for wiping

\[I. 1. Regarding the duration of a night of Brahman, see XX, 14.
'Bhûtâni' means living beings of all the four kinds, born from the womb
and the rest. (Nand.) The three other kinds consist of those produced
from an egg, from sweat, and from a shoot or germ; see Manu I, 43-46.

2\. A Kalpa = a day of Brahman; see XX, 13.\]

the ladle and other sacrificial implements); his nose (the vessel
containing) the clarified butter; his snout was the ladle of oblations;
his voice was similar in sound to the chanting of the Sâma-veda; and he
was of huge size.

5\. He was full of piety and veracity; beautiful; his strides and his
strength were immense (like those of Vish*n*u); his large nostrils were
penances; his knees the victim; and his figure colossal.

6\. His entrails were the (three) chanters of the
Sama-veda<sup>\[1\]</sup>; his member was the burnt-oblation; his
scrotum was the sacrificial seeds and grains; his mind was the altar (in
the hut for the wives and domestic uses of the sacrificer); the
hindparts (of Vish*n*u) in his transformation were the Mantras; his
blood was the Soma juice.

7\. His shoulders were the (great) altar; his smell was that of the
(sacrificial cake and other) oblations; his speed was the oblations to
the gods and to the manes and other oblations; his body was the hut for
the wives and domestic uses of the sacrificer; he was majestic; and
instructed with the initiatory ceremonies for manifold sacrifices
(lasting one, or two, three, or twelve years, and others).

8\. His heart was the sacrificial fee; he was possessed of the
(sacrificial and other) great Mantras employed in order to effect the
union of the mind with the Supreme; he was of enormous size (like the
long sacrifices lasting more than one day); his lovely, lips were the
beginnings of the two

\[6. <sup>1</sup>. This is because the vital breaths, by which the sound
of the voice is effected, pass through them, it having been said (in 4)
that the sound of his voice was like the chanting of the Sâma-veda.'
(Nand.)\]

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

hymns recited at the beginning of the animal sacrifice; his ornaments
were the whirlpool of the milk poured into the heated vessel (at the
Pravargya ceremony introductory to the Soma-sacrifice).

9\. All sorts of sacred texts (the Gâyatrî and others) were his path in
marching; the mysterious Upanishads (the Vedânta) were his couch; he was
accompanied by his consort *Kh*âyâ (Lakshmî); he was in size like the
Ma*n*is*ri*nga mountain.

10\. The lord, the creator, the great Yogin, plunging into the one ocean
from love of the world,

11\. Raised up, with the edge of his tusks, the earth bounded by the sea
together with its mountains, forests, and groves, which was immersed in
the water of (the seven oceans now become) one ocean, and created the
universe anew.

12\. Thus the whole earth, after having sunk into (the lower region
called) Rasâtala, was in the first place raised in the boar-incarnation
by Vish*n*u, who took compassion upon the living beings.

13, 14. Then, after having raised the earth, the destroyer of Madhu
placed and fixed it upon its own (former) seat (upon the oceans) and
distributed the waters upon it according to their own (former) station,
conducting the floods of the oceans into the oceans, the water of the
rivers into the rivers, the water of the tanks into the tanks, and the
water of the lakes into the lakes.

15\. He created the seven (lower regions called) Pâtâlas<sup>\[1\]</sup>
and the seven worlds, the seven Dvîpas

\[15. <sup>1</sup> The seven Pâtâlas are, Atala, Vitala, Sutala,
Mahâtala, Rasâtala, Talâtala, and Pâtâla; the seven worlds are,
Bhûr-loka, Bhuvar-loka, Svar-loka, Mahar-loka, *G*anar-loka, Tapar-loka,
and Satya-loka; the seven Dvîpas or divisions of the terrestrial world,
are, *G*ambu, Plaksha, *S*âlmalî, Ku*s*a, Krauñ*k*a, *S*âka, and
Pushkara; each Dvipa is encircled by one of the seven oceans, viz. the
seas of Lava*n*a (salt-water), Ikshu (syrup), Sarpi*h* (butter), Dadhi
(sour milk), Dugdha (milk), Svâdhu (treacle), and Udaka (water), (Nand.)
The enumerations contained in the Vish*n*u-purâ*n*a and other works
differ on two or three points only from that given by Nand.--

2 Besides the interpretation followed in the text, Nand. proposes a
second explanation of the term 'sthânâni,' as denoting Bhâratavarsha
(India) and the other eight plains situated between the principal
mountains.\]

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

and the seven oceans, and fixed their several limits<sup>\[2\]</sup>.

16\. (He created) the rulers of the (seven) Dvîpas and the (eight)
guardians of the world (Indra and the rest), the rivers, mountains, and
trees, the seven Rishis, who know (and practise) the law, the Vedas
together with their A<u>n</u>gas, the Suras, and the Asuras.

17\. (He created) Pisâ*k*as (ogres), Uragas (serpents), Gandharvas
(celestial singers), Yakshas (keepers of Kubera's treasures), Rakshasas
(goblins), and men, cattle, birds, deer and other animals, (in short)
all the four kinds of living beings<sup>\[1\]</sup>, and clouds,
rainbows, lightnings, and other celestial phenomena or bodies (such as
the planets and the asterisms), and all kinds of sacrifices.

18\. Bhagavat, after having thus created, in the

\[16. The eight 'guardians of the world' (Lokapâlas) are, Indra, Agni,
Yama, Sûrya, Varu*n*a, Pavana, Kubera, and Soma (M.V, 96). The seven
*Ri*shis, according to the Satapatha-brâhma*n*a, are, Gotama,
Bharadvâ*g*a, Vi*s*vâmitra, *G*amadagni, Vasish*th*a, Ka*s*yapa, and
Atri. The six Vedâ<u>n</u>gas are, *S*ikshâ (pronunciation), *Kh*andas
(metre), Vyâkara*n*a (grammar), Nirukta (etymology), Kalpa (ceremonial),
and *G*yotisha (astronomy). See Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature,
p. 108, &c.

17\. <sup>1</sup> See I.\]

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

shape of a boar, this world together with all animate and inanimate
things in it, went away into a place hidden from the world.

19\. *G*anârdana, the chief of the gods, having become invisible, the
goddess of the earth began to consider, 'How shall I be able to sustain
myself (henceforth)?'

20\. 'I will go to Kasyapa to ask: he will tell me the truth. The great
Muni has my welfare under constant consideration.'

21\. Having thus decided upon her course, the goddess, assuming the
shape of a woman, went to see Ka*s*yapa, and Ka*s*yapa saw her.

22\. Her eyes were similar, to the leaves of the blue lotus (of which
the bow of Kâma, the god of love, is made); her face was radiant like
the moon in the autumn season; her locks were as dark as a swarm of
black bees; she was radiant; her lip was (red) like the Bandhu*g*îva
flower; and she was lovely to behold.

23\. Her eyebrows were fine; her teeth exceedingly small; her nose
handsome; her brows bent; her neck shaped like a shell; her thighs were
constantly touching each other; and they were fleshy thighs, which
adorned her loins.

24\. Her breasts were shining white, firm<sup>\[1\]</sup>, plump, very
close to each other, (decorated with continuous strings of pearls) like
the projections on the forehead of Indra's elephant, and radiant like
the gold (of the two golden jars used at the consecration of a king).

\[24 <sup>1</sup> Or 'equal in size,' according to the second of the two
explanations which Nand. proposes of the term 'samau.'\]

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

25\. Her arms were as delicate as lotus fibres; her hands were similar
to young shoots; her thighs were resplendent like golden pillars; and
her knees were hidden (under the flesh), and closely touching each
other.

26\. Her legs were smooth and exquisitely proportioned; her feet
exceedingly graceful; her loins fleshy; and her waist like that of a
lion's cub.

27\. Her reddish nails shone (like rubies); her beauty was the delight
of every looker-on; and with her glances she filled at every step all
the quarters of the sky as it were with lotus-flowers.

28\. Radiant with divine lustre, she illuminated all the quarters of the
sky with it; her clothing was most exquisite and perfectly white; and
she was decorated with the most precious gems.

29\. With her steps she covered the earth as it were with lotuses; she
was endowed with beauty and youthful charms; and made her approach with
modest bearing.

30\. Having seen her come near, Ka*s*yapa saluted her reverentially, and
said, 'O handsome lady, O earth, radiant with divine lustre, I am
acquainted with thy thoughts.

31\. 'Go to visit *G*anârdana, O large-eyed lady; he will tell thee
accurately, how thou shalt henceforth sustain thyself.

32\. For thy sake, O (goddess), whose face is lovely and whose limbs are
beautiful, I have found out, by profound meditation, that his residence
is in the Kshîroda (milk-ocean).'

33\. The goddess of the earth answered, 'Yes, (I shall do as you bid
me),saluted Kasyapa reverentially,

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

and proceeded to the Kshîroda sea, in order to see Ke*s*ava (Vish*n*u).

34\. She beheld (then) the ocean, from which the Am*ri*ta arose. It was
lovely, like the rays of the moon, and agitated by hundreds of waves
produced by stormy blasts of wind.

35\. (With its waves) towering like a hundred Himâlayas it seemed
another terrestrial globe, calling near as it were the earth with its
hands; the rolling waves.

36\. With those hands it was as it were constantly producing the
radiancy of the moon; and every stain of guilt was removed from it by
Hari's (Vish*n*u's) residence within its limits.

37\. Because (it was entirely free from sin) therefore it was possessed
of a pure and shining frame; its colour was white; it was inaccessible
to birds and its seat was in the lower regions.

38\. It was rich in blue and tawny gems (sapphires, coral, and others),
and looking therefore as if the atmosphere had descended upon the earth,
and as if a number of forests adorned with a multitude of fruits had
descended upon its surface.

39\. Its size was immense, like that of the skin of (Vish*n*u's) serpent
*S*esha. After having seen the milk-ocean, the goddess of the earth
beheld the dwelling of Ke*s*ava (Vish*n*u) which was in it:

40\. (His dwelling), the size of which cannot be expressed in words,
and, the sublimity of which is also beyond the power of utterance. In it
she saw the destroyer of Madhu seated upon *S*esha.

41\. The lotus of his face was hardly visible on

\[37. See 15, note.\]

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

account of the lustre of the gems decorating the neck of the snake
Sesha; he was shining like a hundred moons; and his splendour was equal
to the rays of a myriad of suns.

42\. He was clad in a yellow robe (radiant like gold); imperturbable;
decorated with all kinds of gems; and shining with the lustre of a
diadem resembling the sun in colour, and with (splendid) ear-rings.

43\. Lakshmî was stroking his feet with her soft palms; and his
attributes (the shell, the discus, the mace, and the lotus-flower)
wearing bodies were attending upon him on all sides.

44\. Having espied the lotus-eyed slayer of Madhu, she knelt down upon
the ground and addressed him as follows:

45\. 'When formerly I was sunk into the region of Rasâtala, I was raised
by thee, O God, and restored to my ancient seat, O Vish*n*u, thanks to
thy benevolence towards living beings.

46\. 'Being there, how am I to maintain myself upon it, O lord of the
gods?' Having been thus addressed by the goddess, the god enunciated the
following answer:

47\. 'Those who practise the duties ordained for each caste and for each
order, and who act up strictly to the holy law, will sustain thee, O
earth; to them is thy care committed.'

48\. Having received this answer, the goddess of the earth said to the
chief of the gods, 'Communicate to me the eternal laws of the castes and
of the orders.

\[47. Regarding the four castes and the four orders, see II, 1; III,
3.\]

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

49\. I desire to learn them from thee; for thou art my chief stay.
Adoration be to thee, O brilliant<sup>\[1\]</sup> chief of the gods, who
annihilatest the power of the (Daityas and other) enemies of the gods.

50\. 'O Nârâya*n*a (son of Nara), O *G*agannâtha (sovereign of the
world); thou holdest the shell, the discus, and the mace (in thy hands);
thou hast a lotus (Brahman) springing from thy navel; thou art the lord
of the senses; thou art Most powerful and endowed with conquering
strength.

51\. 'Thou art beyond the cognisance of the senses; thy end is most
difficult to know; thou art brilliant; thou holdest the bow
Sâr<u>n</u>ga; thou art the boar<sup>\[1\]</sup>; thou art terrible;
thou art Govinda<sup>\[2\]</sup> (the herdsman); thou art of old; thou
art Purushottama (the spirit supreme).

52\. 'Thy hair is golden; thy eyes are everywhere; thy body is the
sacrifice; thou art free from stain; thou art the "field." (the
corporeal frame); thou art the principle of life; thou art the ruler

\[49. <sup>1</sup> This is Nand.'s interpretation of the term 'deva,'
but it may also be taken in its usual acceptation of 'god.'

51\. <sup>1</sup> This is the third of the three interpretations of the
term varâha, which Nand. proposes. According to the first, it would mean
'one who kills his worst or most prominent foes;' according to the
second, 'one who gratifies his own desires.' But these two
interpretations are based upon a fanciful derivation of varâha from vara
and â-han. Of many others among the epithets Nand. proposes equally
fanciful etymologies, which I shall pass over unnoticed.--

2 This epithet, which literally means 'he who finds or wins cows,' is
usually referred to Vishnu's recovering the 'cow,' i.e. the earth, when
it was lost in the waters: see Mahâbh. XII, 13228, which verse is quoted
both by Nand. and by *S*a<u>n</u>kara in his Commentary on the
Vish*n*u-sahasranâma. It originally refers, no doubt, to Vishnu or
Krishna as the pastoral god.\]

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

of the world; thou art lying on the bed of the ocean.

53\. 'Thou art Mantra (prayer); thou knowest the Mantras; thou
surpassest all conception; thy frame is composed of the Vedas and
Vedâ<u>n</u>gas; the creation and destruction of this whole world is
effected through thee.

54\. 'Thou knowest right and wrong; thy body is law; law springs from
thee; desires are gratified by thee: thy powers are everywhere; thou art
(imperishable like) Amrita (ambrosia); thou art heaven; thou art the
destroyer of Madhu and Kai*t*asa.

55\. 'Thou causest the increase of the great thou art inscrutable; thou
art all thou givest shelter to all; thou art the chief one thou art free
from sin; thou art *G*îmûta; thou art inexhaustible; thou art the
creator.

56\. 'Thou increasest the welfare (of the world), the waters spring from
thee; thou art the seat of intelligence; action is not found in thee;
thou presidest over seven chief things<sup>\[1\]</sup>; thou art the
teacher of religious rites; thou art of old; thou art Purushottama.

57, 'Thou art not to be shaken; thou art undecaying;

\[55. 'The great (b*ri*hat) means time, space, and the like. . . . He is
called "all" because he is capable of assuming any shape.' (Nand.) The
sense of the term '*g*imûta,' as an epithet of divine beings, is
uncertain. According to Nand., it would mean 'he who sprinkles living
beings;' but this interpretation is based upon a fanciful derivation,
from *g*îva and mûtrayati.

56\. <sup>1</sup> This refers either to the seven divisions of a Sâman;
or to the seven species, of which each of the three kinds of sacrifices,
domestic offerings, burnt-offerings, and Soma-sacrifices, consists (cf.
Gaut. VIII, 18-20); or to the seven worlds (see 15, note), Bhûr and the
rest. (Nand.)\]

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

thou art the producer of the atoms; thou art kind to faithful
attendants; thou art the purifier (of sinners); thou art the protector
of all the gods thou art the protector of the pious.

58\. 'Thou art also the protector of those who know the Veda, O
Purushottama. I have come, O *G*agannâtha, to the immovable Vâ*k*aspati
(the lord of holy speech), the lord;

59\. 'To him, who is very pious; invincible; Vasushe*n*a (who has
treasures for his armies); who bestows largesses upon his followers, who
is endowed with the power of intense devotion; who is the germ of the
ether; from whom the rays (of the sun and moon) proceed;

60\. 'To Vâsudeva; the great soul of the universe; whose eyes are like
lotuses; who is eternal; the preceptor of the Suras and of the Asuras;
brilliant; omnipresent; the great lord of all creatures;

61\. 'Who has one body and four faces; who is the producer of (the five
grosser elements, ether, air, fire, water, and earth), the producers of
the world. Teach me concisely, O Bhagavat, the eternal laws ordained for
the aggregate of the four castes,

62\. 'Together with the customs to be observed by each order and with
the secret ordinances.' The chief of the gods, thus addressed by the
goddess of the earth, replied to her as follows:

\[62. According to Nand., the term rahasya, 'secret ordinances or
doctrines,' has to be referred either to the laws regarding the
occupations lawful for each caste in times of distress see II, 15), or
to the penances (XLVI seq.) The latter interpretation seems to be the
more plausible one, with the limitation, however, that rahasya is only
used to denote the penances for secret faults, which are termed rahasya
in LV, 1.\]

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

63\. Learn from me, in a concise form, O radiant goddess of the earth,
the eternal laws for the aggregate of the four castes, together with the
customs to be observed by each order, and with the secret ordinances,

64\. 'Which will effect the final liberation of the virtuous persons,
who will support thee. Be seated upon this splendid golden seat, O
handsome-thighed goddess.

65\. 'Seated at ease, listen to me proclaiming the sacred laws.' The
goddess of the earth, thereupon, seated at case, listened to the sacred
precepts as, they came from the mouth of Vish*n*u.
