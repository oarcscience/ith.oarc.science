2\. The use of the particle *k*a implies, according, to Nand. and a
passage of Yama quoted by him, that, besides brawling him, the criminal
should be shorn, his deed publicly proclaimed, and himself mounted upon
an ass and led about the town.\]

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

offence, as mentioned by Yâ*g*ñavalkya,(II, 278). A Kumbha is a measure
of grain equal to twenty Dro*n*as, or a little more than three bushels
and three gallons. Nand. mentions, as the opinion of some, that 1 Kumbha

the highest caste) concerning his duty, let the king order hot oil to be

old man, or a (whole) caste or corporation (of judges or others);
