<P>31. Nand. infers from another Sm<I>ri</I>ti passage that <I>k</I>a here refers to a crow and to a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra or workman with his tools.</P>
<P>32. Nand. here refers <I>k</I>a to shells and other objects mentioned in a Sm<I>ri</I>ti.</P>

<P>36. Or (if he has seen) one wearing a dress (of a reddish-yellow colour) dyed with Kash&acirc;ya<SUP>[1]</SUP>, or an ascetic, or one smeared<SUP>[2]</SUP> (with ashes)<SUP>[3]</SUP>;</P>
<P>37. Or (if he has seen) oil, or sugar, or dry cow-dung, or fire-wood, or grass (other than Ku<I>s</I>a or D&ucirc;rv&acirc; grass), or Pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a (and other leaves, other than betel leaves), ashes, or coal<SUP>[1]</SUP>;</P>

<P>39. (If he sees), while about to begin a journey, a lute, or sandal-wood, or fresh pot-herbs, or a turban, or an Ornament, or an unmarried damsel, he must praise them.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[36. <SUP>1</SUP> Nand. refers k&acirc;sh&acirc;yin, 'wearing a dress dyed with Kash&acirc;ya,' to 'persons who wear the marks of an order to which they do not belong.' But this interpretation is evidently wrong. Among the sects that wear a dress dyed with Kash&acirc;ya, Buddhists are the most prominent, but it must not be overlooked that there are other important sects also, as e. g. the Sv&acirc;min&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;s of the present day, who wear such dresses.--<SUP>2</SUP> The term malina, 'smeared,' no doubt refers to a <I>S</I>aiva sect. Nand. interprets it by 'K&acirc;p&acirc;likas and the like;' but more probably the P&acirc;<I>s</I>upatas are meant.--<SUP>3</SUP> The particle <I>k</I>a further refers to the humpbacked, deaf, and blind, to barren women, and to naked and hungry persons, as stated in a Sm<I>ri</I>ti. (Nand,)</P>
<P>37. <SUP>1</SUP> Nand. refers the particle <I>k</I>a in this S&ucirc;tra to hares, naked mendicants, snakes, iguanas, lizards, skins, and other inauspicious objects and persons enumerated in a Sm<I>ri</I>ti.</P>
<P>38. Nand. argues from a passage of N&acirc;rada (not found in his Institutes), that the particle <I>k</I>a here refers to persons mounted upon an ass, camel, or buffalo, and others.</P>
<P>39. <SUP>1</SUP> Nand. mentions two explanations of this S&ucirc;tra: 1. he must eulogise the above objects or persons if he sees them; 2. he must gladden persons, who have those objects or persons with them, with presents and the like.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_203"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 203</FONT></A></P>
<P>40. He must not (knowingly) step on (or step over, or stand on) the shade of the image of a deity, of a (learned) Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, of a spiritual teacher, of a brown (bull or other animal), or of one by whom the initiatory ceremony at a Soma-sacrifice has been performed.</P>
<P>41. Nor (must he step) on anything spat out or vomited, nor on blood, nor on f&aelig;ces or urine, nor on water used for ablutions.</P>
<P>42. He must not step over a rope to which a calf (or a cow) is tied.</P>
<P>43. He must not walk quickly in the rain.</P>
<P>44. He must not cross a river without need;</P>
<P>45. Nor without having previously offered an oblation of water to the gods and to the manes;</P>
<P>46. Nor (swimming) with his arms;</P>
<P>47. Nor in a leaky vessel.</P>
<P>48. He must not stand on the bank (of a river).</P>
<P>49. He must not gaze into a pool.</P>
<P>50. He must not cross it (by swimming through it, or in any other way).</P>
<P>51. Way must be made for an aged man, for one carrying a burden, for a king, for a Sn&acirc;taka (of any of the three kinds<SUP>[1]</SUP>), for a woman, for a sick person, for a bridegroom, and for one riding in a carriage. Among those, should they all meet, a king must be</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[41. According to Nand., the particle v&acirc;, 'or,' is added at the end of this S&ucirc;tra, in order to include an officiating priest and others mentioned by Y&acirc;<I>g</I>&ntilde;avalkya I, 152.</P>
<P>51. <SUP>1</SUP> The Sn&acirc;taka (see XXV III, 42, note) is of three kinds: 1. the Vidy&acirc;sn&acirc;taka, who has studied the Vedas; 2. the Vratasn&acirc;taka, who has performed the Vratas or vowed observances of a student; 3. the Ubhayasn&acirc;taka, who has completed both the Vedas and the Vratas. (Nand.) See the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras.]</P>
