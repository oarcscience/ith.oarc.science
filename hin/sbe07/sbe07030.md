1\. <sup>1</sup> 'I.e. after the performance of the initiation
ceremony.' (Nand.)

5\. The sense of this injunction, according to Nand., is, that he must
not pronounce any bathing Mantras. But more probably it {footnote p.
117} is meant, that he shall swim motionless like a stick (see Âpast. I,
1, 2, 30, with Dr. Bühler's note). According to a third explanation,
which is mentioned both by Haradatta and by Devapâla in his Commentary
on the Kâ*th*aka G*ri*hya-sûtra, the sense would be, that he is not
allowed, while bathing, to rub his skin, in order to clean himself with
bathing powder and the like.\]

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

6\. Let him study when called (by his teacher).

7\. He shall act so as to please his Guru (spiritual teacher) and to be
serviceable to him.

8\. He shall wear his girdle, his staff, his skin, and his sacrificial
string.

9\. He shall go begging at the houses of virtuous persons, excepting
those of his Guru's (and of his own) relatives.

10\. He may eat (every morning and evening) some of the food collected
by begging, after having received permission to do so from his Guru.

11\. He must avoid *S*râddhas, factitious salt, food turned
sour<sup>\[1\]</sup>, stale food, dancing, singing, women, honey, meat,
ointments, remnants of the food (of other persons than his teacher), the
killing of living beings, and rude speeches.

12.. He must occupy a low couch.

13\. He must rise before his Guru and go to rest after him.

14\. He must salute his Guru, after having performed his morning
devotion.

15\. Let him embrace his feet with crossed hands.

\[11. <sup>1</sup> Nand. interprets *s*ukta, 'food turned sour,' by
'rude speeches,' because if taken in its other meaning, it would be
included in the next term, paryushita, 'stale food.' However, if Nand.'s
interpretation were followed, it would coincide with the last term of
this enumeration, a*s*lîla, 'rude speeches;' and its position between
two articles of food renders the above interpretation more plausible.\]

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

16\. The right foot with his right hand, and the left foot with his
left.

17\. After the salutation (abhivâdaye, 'I salute') he must mention his
own name and add the word 'bhos' (Venerable Sir) at the end of his
address.

18\. He must not speak to his Guru while he is himself standing, or
sitting, or lying, or eating, or averting his face.

19\. And let him speak, if his teacher sits, standing up; if he walks,
advancing towards him; if he is coming near, meeting him; if he runs,
running after him;

20\. If his face is averted, turning round so as to face him;

21\. If he is at some distance, approaching him;

22\. If he is in a reclining position, bending to him;

23\. Let him not sit in a careless attitude (such as e. g. having a
cloth tied round his legs and knees, while sitting on his hams) before
the eyes of his teacher,

24\. Neither must he pronounce his mere name (without adding to it the
word *S*rî or a similar term at the beginning).

25\. He must not mimic his gait, his manner, his speech, and so on.

26\. Where his Guru is censured or foully belied, there let him not
stay.

27\. Nor must he sit on the same seat with him,

28\. Unless it be on a rock<sup>\[1\]</sup>, on a wooden bench, in a
boat, or in a carriage.

\[28. <sup>1</sup> Thus according to Kullûka, (on M. II, 204). Nand.
takes the term *s*îlaphalaka as a compound denoting a stone seat.'\]

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

29\. If his teacher's teacher is near, let him behave towards him as if
he were his own teacher.

30\. He must nor salute his own Gurus without his teacher's leave.

31\. Let him behave towards the son of his teacher, who teaches him the
Veda, as towards his teacher, even though he be younger or of an equal
age with himself;

32\. But he must not wash his feet,

33\. Nor eat the leaving of his food.

34\. Thus let him acquire by heart one Veda, or two Vedas, or (all) the
Vedas.

35\. Thereupon, the Vedâ<u>n</u>gas (that treating of phonetics and the
rest)<sup>\[1\]</sup>.

36\. He who, not having studied the Veda, applies himself to another
study, will degrade himself, and his progeny with him, to the state of a
*S*ûdra.

37\. From the mother is the first birth; the second, from the girding
with the sacrificial string.

38\. In the latter, the Sâvitrî hymn is his mother, and the teacher his
father.

39\. It is this which entitles members of the three higher castes to the
designation of 'the twice-born.'

40\. Previous to his being girded with the sacrificial string, a member
of these castes is similar to a *S*ûdra (and not allowed to study the
Veda).

\[30. Nand. here interprets Guru by 'a paternal uncle and the rest.'

31\. This rule refers to a son of his spiritual teacher, who teaches him
one or two chapters of the Veda, while the teacher himself is gone out
for bathing or some such reason. Vâ, 'or,' is added in order to include
a son of the teacher, who is himself a pupil, as Manu (II, 208) says.
(Nand.)

35\. <sup>1</sup> See Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 108
seq.

38\. <sup>1</sup> Rig-Veda, III, 62, 10.\]

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

41\. A student shall shave all his hair, or wear it tied in one lock.

42\. After having mastered the Veda, let him take leave of his teacher
and bathe, after having presented, him with a gift.

43\. Or let him spend the remainder of his life at his teacher's house.

44\. If, while he is living there, his teacher should die, let him
behave to his teacher's son as towards his teacher himself;

45\. Or<sup>\[1\]</sup> towards one of his wives, who is equal to him in
caste.

46\. On failure of such, let him pay homage to the fire, and live as a
perpetual student.

47\. A Brâhma*n*a who passes thus without tiring (of the discharge of
his duties) the time of his studentship will attain to the most exalted
heavenly abode (that of Brahman) after his death, and will not be born
again in this world.

48\. A voluntary effusion of the semen by a twice-born youth (in sexual
intercourse with a woman), during the period of his studentship, has
been pronounced a transgression of the rule prescribed for students by
expounders of the Vedas well acquainted with the system of duties.

49\. Having loaded himself with that crime, be must go begging to seven
houses, clothed only with the skin of an ass, and proclaiming his deed.

\[42. After the solemn bath (see Â*s*v. III, 8, 9; Gobh. III, 4; Pâr.
II, 6; *S*â<u>n</u>kh. III, 1), which terminates the period of
studentship, the student, who is henceforth called Snâtaka, 'one who has
bathed,' is allowed to return home.

45\. 'According to Nand., the particle vâ, 'or,' is used in order to
include another alternative, that of living with an old fellow-student,
as directed by Gautama, III, 8.\]

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

50\. Eating once a day only a meal consisting of the alms obtained at
those (houses), and bathing at the three Savanas (dawn, noon, and
evening), he will be absolved from guilt at the end of the year.

51\. After an involuntary effusion of the semen during sleep, a
twice-born student must bathe (on the next morning), worship the sun (by
offerings of perfumes and the like), and mutter three times the Mantra,
'Again shall my strength return to me<sup>\[1\]</sup>.'

52\. He who for seven days omits to collect alms and to kindle the
sacred fire, must perform the penance of an Avakîr*n*in (breaker of his
vow), provided that he has not been prevented from the discharge of his
duties by an illness.

53\. If the sun should rise or set while a student is purposely
indulging in sleep, ignoring (the precepts of law), he must fast for a
day, muttering (the Gâyatrî one thousand and eight times).
