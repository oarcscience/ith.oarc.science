# LXXXIX.

1\. The month Kârttika is sacred to the god Agni.

2\. Agni is the first of all gods.

3\. Therefore is that man purified from every sin committed during the
past year, who persists during the month Kârttika in bathing (daily) out
of the village, in muttering the Gâyatrî, and in taking a single meal
each day, consisting of food fit for oblations.

4\. He who bathes (at the prescribed time, early in the morning)
constantly, during the whole month Kârttika, who keeps his organs of
sense under control, who mutters (the Gâyatrî), who eats food fit for
oblations only, and who governs his passions, is purified from every
sin.
