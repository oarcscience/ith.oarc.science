ordeal), who must turn his face towards the east and stretch out both
arms.

4\. Those (leaves) and his hands he must bind together with a thread.

5\. Then he must place into his hands a ball made of iron, red-hot,

circles, without either walking at a very hurried pace, or lingering on
his way.

7\. Finally, after having passed the seventh circle, he must put down
the ball upon the ground.

proof has not been decided.

smeared with sour milk upon his hands, as ordained in a passage of
Pitâmaha.\]

'Thou, O fire, dwellest in the interior of all creatures, like a
witness. O fire, thou knowest what mortals do not comprehend.

12\. 'This man being arraigned in a cause, desires to be cleared from
guilt. Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.'
