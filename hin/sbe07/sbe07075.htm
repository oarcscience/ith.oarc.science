<P>1. One desirous of celebrating a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha must invite the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as on the day before (it is to take place).</P>
<P>2. On the next day, in the forenoon, if it falls in the bright half of the month, and in the afternoon, if it falls in the dark half of the month, the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, who must have duly bathed and duly sipped water, must be placed by him, in the order of their seniority' (or) of their sacred knowledge, upon seats covered with Ku<I>s</I>a grass.</P>
<P>3. (He must entertain) two (Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as) facing the east at the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha of the gods (Vi<I>s</I>vedev&acirc;s), and three facing the north at the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha of the manes;</P>
<P>4. Or one only at each <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha.</P>
<P>5. After having (worshipped the Vi<I>s</I>vedev&acirc;s and) offered a burnt-oblation: during the recitation of the first Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>aka (pentad) at a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha repast consisting</P>

This chapter opens the section on <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddhas (funeral oblations), which consists of thirteen chapters (LXXIII-LXXXV. Nand.)</P>
<P>1. The Ekoddish<I>t</I>a and Sapi<I>nd</I>&icirc;kara<I>n</I>a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddhas have been described above, XXI. The rules given in the present chapter refer to all the remaining kinds of <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddhas, See 5-9, LXXIV, LXXVI-LXXVIII.</P>
<P>2. <SUP>1</SUP> At the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha of the manes the oldest Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a represents the great-grandfather; the one next to him in age, the grandfather; the youngest of the three, the father of the sacrificer. (Nand.)</P>
<P>5-9. The three Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>akas referred to in S&ucirc;tras 5-9 are respectively vv. 1-5, 6-10, and 11-15 of K&acirc;<I>th</I>aka XXXIX, 10. (Nand.) The great majority of the Mantras quoted in S&ucirc;tras 11-26 have {footnote p. 233} not been traced in the Berlin US. of the K&acirc;<I>th</I>aka, nor indeed in any other Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; of the Veda, but there can be no doubt that they, belong, to the school of the Ka<I>th</I>as, as nearly all are quoted by their Prat&icirc;kas in the K&acirc;<I>th</I>aka G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra, and given at full in Devap&acirc;la's Commentary on the latter. The above renderings of the Prat&icirc;kas rest upon Devap&acirc;la's interpretations. That the rules in 5 seq. teach the performance of a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha according to the rites of the Ka<I>th</I>a school, is confirmed by Nand. in his remarks on 5 seq. and 9 seq.]</P>

<P>9. 'And on the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddhas taking place on the seventh day of the dark half, as <I>k</I>a indicates.' (Nand.) This statement does not, however, deserve much credit, as such <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddhas are neither mentioned in our work nor in the K&acirc;<I>th</I>aka G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra.</P>
<P>10. <SUP>1</SUP> 'The permission of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as has to be asked with the Mantra, "I shall invite (the manes);" and their answer must be, "Invite the,!"' (Nand.)</P>
<P>11. The Y&acirc;tudh&acirc;nas are a class of demons supposed to disturb {footnote p. 234} the effect of a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha. The second Mantra, according to Devap&acirc;la, is from the Rig-veda, X, 15, 1.]</P>

<P>Mantras (the first of which begins with the words), 'May the Asuras go away;'</P>
<P>12. He must invite the manes (with the four Mantras), 'Come near, O ye manes,' '(Conduct) them all (here), O Agni,' 'May my (ancestors) come near,' 'This is your (share), O ye manes.' Then let him prepare the water for washing the feet with scented water, which has been mixed up with Kusa grass and sesamum, while reciting (the three Mantras), 'Those standing<SUP>[1]</SUP>,' 'Speech is imperishable,' and 'What my mother (has sinned)<SUP>[1]</SUP>,' and offer it (to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as); let him prepare the Arghya (or water mixed with D&ucirc;rv&acirc; grass, flowers, &amp;c.) and offer it to them; let him offer to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, to the best of his power, Ku<I>s</I>a grass, sesamum, clothes, flowers, ornaments, incense, and lamps; let him take food sprinkled with clarified butter; let him look them in the face with the Mantra, 'O ye &Acirc;dityas, Rudras, and Vasus;' let him say, 'I will offer an oblation in the fire,' and if the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as say, 'Offer an oblation,' let him offer three burnt-oblations<SUP>[2]</SUP>.'</P>
<P>13. After having consecrated the offerings with the Mantras, 'They, who are my ancestors,' 'This is your (share), O ye manes,' and 'This offering,' he must pour (what is left of) the food into such vessels as happen to be there, or (into golden ones at the offering addressed to the Vi<I>s</I>vedev&acirc;s and) into silver</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[12. <SUP>1</SUP> These two Mantras are also quoted, with slight variations, by <I>S</I>&acirc;<U>n</U>kh&acirc;yana III, 13, 5.--<SUP>2</SUP> The three burnt-oblations have to be accompanied by the recitation of the three Mantras, 'To Soma accompanied by the manes svadh&acirc; nama<I>h</I>; to Yama A<U>n</U>giras svadh&acirc; nama<I>h</I>; to Agni who takes the offerings addressed to the manes svadh&acirc; nama<I>h</I>.'

<P>ones (at the offering addressed to the manes), and offer it first to the two Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as facing the east (who have been invited to the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha of the gods).</P>
<P>14. Afterwards he must offer it to the (three) Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as facing north (who represent his three ancestors, addressing himself) to his father, grandfather and great-grandfather, (and calling out) their name and race.</P>
<P>15. While the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as are eating the food, let him mutter (the three Mantras), 'Whatever (trickles down) through my fault,' 'With days and nights<SUP>[1]</SUP>,' and 'Whatever (limb) of yours, Agni.'</P>
<P>16. And (let him mutter) the Itih&acirc;sa (Epics), Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>a (Legends), and the Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra (Institutes of the Sacred Law).</P>
<P>17. Near the leavings let him deposit upon blades of Ku<I>s</I>a grass with the ends turned towards the south one ball of rice for his father, while saying, 'Earth is (like) a spoon, imperishable (satisfaction).' </P>
<P>18. With the Mantra, 'Air is (like) a spoon, imperishable (satisfaction,' let him deposit) a second ball for his grandfather.</P>
<P>19. With the Mantra, 'Heaven is (like) a spoon, imperishable (satisfaction,' let him deposit) a third ball for his great-grandfather.</P>
<P>20. With the Mantra, 'Those ancestors who</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[14. The formula of this invocation, according to Nand., is this, 'To NN., my ancestor, of the Gotra NN., who is like a Vasu, (I offer) this food, svadh&acirc; nama<I>h</I>.' The use of the particle <I>k</I>a, according to the same, implies that the maternal grandfather and the other maternal ancestors must also be addressed as ordained below (LXXV, 7).</P>
<P>15. <SUP>1</SUP> A similar Mantra is quoted, <I>S</I>&acirc;<U>n</U>kh, III, 13, 5.]</P>

<P>have died,' let him place a garment (upon the balls).</P>
<P>21. With the Mantra, 'Give us sons, O ye manes,' (let him place) food upon them.</P>
<P>22. With the Mantra, 'Enjoy it, O ye manes, partake of it, (each according to his share<SUP>[1]</SUP>,' let him wipe off the grease from his hands with the ends of the blades.</P>
<P>23, With the Mantra, '(Ye waters) imparting vigour<SUP>[1]</SUP>,' let him sprinkle the balls to the right with the wet (remainder of the food), and offer the Argha<SUP>[2]</SUP>, flowers, incense, unguents, and rice, and other victuals and dainties to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as.</P>
<P>24. And (he must offer them, ) a jar with water, which has been mixed up with honey, clarified butter, sesamum, and (ointments, oil, and the like).</P>
<P>25. The Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as having eaten and being satisfied, let him sprinkle the food (as much as has been left by them) and the grass with the Mantra, 'Mayest thou not fail me,' and strew the food near the leavings; and having asked them, 'Are you satisfied? Is (the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha) finished,' he must first give water for sipping to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as facing the north, and then to those facing the east; and he must sprinkle the place where the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha has been offered (with water, with the Mantra), 'Well sprinkled.' All these rites he must perform while holding blades of sacred grass in his hand.</P>
<P>26. Afterwards he must, while turning his face towards the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as facing the east, circumambulate</P>

<P>them from left to right, with the Mantra, 'What a crow (may have eaten of my offering),' and turn back again; he must honour them with sacrificial fees, to the best of his power, saying, 'May you be satisfied,' and on their answering, 'We are satisfied,' he must address them with the Mantra, 'The gods and the manes.'</P>
<P>27. After having given (to all) water (with the Mantra, 'May the food and water and whatever else I gave you be) imperishable,' (and calling out their name and race, and having added the Mantra, 'May the Vi<I>s</I>vedev&acirc;s be satisfied,' he must ask, with folded hands, and with an attentive and cheerful mind, the following (benediction) from the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as facing the east:</P>
<P>28. 'May the liberal-minded in our race increase in number, and may the (study of the) Vedas and our progeny (also increase). May faith not depart from us, and may we have plenty to bestow on the poor.</P>
<P>29. They shall answer, 'Thus let it be.'</P>
<P>30. (The second half of the benediction shall be, as follows), "May we have plenty of food, and may we receive guests. May others come to beg of us, and may not we be obliged to beg of any one.'</P>
<P>31. After having received this double benediction (through the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as saying, 'Thus let it be'),</P>
<P>32. He must dismiss the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, with the Mantra, 'With all food<SUP>[1]</SUP>,' after having honoured them according to custom, accompanied them (as far as the limits of his estate), and taken his leave of them.</P>
