servant, and has been signed by his chief judge, with his own hand.

4\. It is (said to be) attested by, witnesses when, having been written
anywhere, and by any one, it is signed by witnesses in their own hands.

5\. It is (said to be) unattested when it has been written (by the party

7\. Neither does any fraudulent document (make evidence);

8\. Nor a document (which), though attested, (is vitiated) by the
signature of a witness bribed (by one party) or of bad character;

9\. Nor one written by a scribe of the same description;

one under duress, by a female, by a child, by force, and by intimidation

Sûtra 10.

11\. <sup>1</sup> I have translated the reading
vyaktâdhividhilaksha*n*am, which, though not occurring in the text of
any MS., is mentioned by Nand., and is found in an identical passage of
the Institutes of Nârada (see Nârada IV, 60, and Appendix, p. 123).\]

letters or signs (such as the flourish denoting the word *S*rî and the
like) or documents executed by the same man, by (enquiring into) the
probabilities of the case, and by (finding out such writings as show) a
mode of writing similar (to that contained in the disputed document).

13\. Should the debtor, or creditor, or witness, or scribe be dead, the
authenticity of the document has to be ascertained by (comparing with it
other.) specimens of their handwriting.
