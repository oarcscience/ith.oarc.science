# XXIX.

1\. He who having initiated a youth and instructed him in the
Vratas<sup>\[1\]</sup>, teaches him (one branch of) the Veda (together
with its A<u>n</u>gas, such as that relating to phonetics, and the rest)
is called Â*k*ârya (teacher).

\[51. <sup>\[1\]</sup> Taitt. Âra*n*y. I, 30.

XXIX\. 1. Âpast. I, 1, 1, 13; Gaut., I, 9.--13. M. II. 140-143; Y. I,
34, 35.--7-10. M. II, 111, 112, 114, 115.--9, 10. See Bühler, Introd. to
Digest, p. xxix.

1\. The Vratas of a student are certain observances to be kept by him
before he is admitted to the regular course of study of the Veda, and
again before he is allowed to proceed to the study of the Mahânâmnî
verses and to the other higher stages of Vedic learning. See,
particularly, *S*â<u>n</u>kh. II, 11, 12, with Dr. Oldenberg's note
(Ind. Stud. XV, 139).\]

2\. He who teaches him (after he has been initiated by another) either
(an entire branch of the Veda) in consideration of a fee, or part of a
Veda (without taking a fee), is called Upâdhyâya (sub-teacher).

3\. He who performs sacrifices (whether based upon *S*ruti or upon
Sm*ri*ti) is called *Ri*tvi*g* (officiating priest).

4\. He must not engage a priest for the performance of sacrifices
without having ascertained (his descent, character, and conduct).

5\. Neither must he admit to his teaching (one whom he does not know).

6\. And he must not initiate such a one.

7\. If one answers improperly, or the other asks
improperly<sup>\[1\]</sup>, that one (or both) will perish or incur
hatred.

8\. If by instructing a pupil neither religious merit nor wealth are
acquired, and if no sufficient attention is to be obtained from him (for
his teacher's words), in such soil divine knowledge must not be sown: it
would perish like fine seed in barren soil.

9\. The deity of sacred knowledge approached a Brâhma*n*a (and said to
him), 'Preserve me, I am thy treasure, reveal me not to a scorner, nor
to a wicked man, nor to one of uncontrolled passions: thus I shall be
strong

10\. 'Reveal me to him, as to a keeper of thy gem, O Brâhma*n*a, whom
thou shalt know to be pure, attentive, possessed of a good memory, and
chaste, who will not grieve thee, nor revile thee.'

\[7. <sup>1</sup> A proper question is, e. g. if the pupil modestly
says, 'I don't know about this, therefore I want to be instructed.' An
improper question is, e.g. if he says, 'Why do you pronounce this thus
wrongly?' An improper answer is an answer to an improper question.
