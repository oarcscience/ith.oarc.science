# LXXX.

1\. Sesamum, rice, barley, beans, water, roots, fruits, vegetables,
*S*yâmâka grain, millet, wild rice, kidney-beans, and wheat satisfy (the
manes) for a month;

2\. The flesh of fishes (excepting those species that are forbidden),
for two months;

3\. The flesh of the common deer, for three months;

4\. The flesh of sheep, for four months;

5\. The flesh of birds (of those kinds that may be eaten), for five
months;

6\. The flesh of goats, for six months;

7\. The flesh of the spotted deer, for seven months;

8\. The flesh of the spotted antelope, for eight months;

9\. Beef, for nine months;

10\. Buffalo's meat, for ten months;

11\. The meat of a hornless goat, for eleven months;

12\. The milk of a cow, or preparations from it, for a year.

13\. On this subject there exists a stanza, which the manes utter:

14\. '(The pot-herb) Kâla*s*âka (sacred basil), (the prawn) Mahâ*s*alka,
and the flesh of the (crane called) Vârdhrî*n*asa<sup>\[1\]</sup>, (and
of) a rhinoceros having no horn, is food which we always accept.'

\[LXXX. 1-14. M. III, 267-272; Y. I, 257-259; Âpast. II, 7, 16, 23-II,
7, 17, 3; II, 8, 18, 13; Gaut. XV, 19.

14\. <sup>1</sup> This is the first of the two interpretations which
Nand. proposes of the term Vârdhrî*n*asa. It is supported by Âpastamba's
{footnote p. 250} commentator, Haradatta, and by Âpastamba himself (I,
5, 17, 36). Nand.'s second interpretation, 'an old white goat,' is
probably wrong, although it is supported by the authority of Kullûka and
Vi*g*ñâne*s*vara.\]
