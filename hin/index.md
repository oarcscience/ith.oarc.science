### The Vedas

There are four Vedas, the Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda and Atharva
Veda. The Vedas are the primary texts of Hinduism. They also had a vast
influence on Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Traditionally the text of
the Vedas was coeval with the universe. Scholars have determined that
the Rig Veda, the oldest of the four Vedas, was composed about 1500
B.C., and codified about 600 B.C. It is unknown when it was finally
committed to writing, but this probably was at some point after 300 B.C.

The Vedas contain hymns, incantations, and rituals from ancient India.
Along with [the Book of the Dead](../egy/ebod/index.md), the [Enuma
Elish](../ane/enuma), the [I Ching](../ich/index.md), and the
[Avesta](../zor/index.md), they are among the most ancient religious texts
still in existence. Besides their spiritual value, they also give a
unique view of everyday life in India four thousand years ago. The Vedas
are also the most ancient extensive texts in an Indo-European language,
and as such are invaluable in the study of comparative linguistics.

#### Atharva Veda

The Atharva Veda also contains material from the Rig Veda, but of
interest are the numerous incantations and metaphysical texts, which
this anthology (part of the Sacred Books of the East series) collects
and categorizes. The Atharva Veda was written down much later than the
rest of the Vedas, about 200 B.C.; it may have been composed about 1000
B.C.

### Upanishads

The Upanishads are a continuation of the Vedic philosophy, and were
written between 800 and 400 B.C. They elaborate on how the soul
(*Atman*) can be united with the ultimate truth (*Brahman*) through
contemplation and mediation, as well as the doctrine of *Karma*-- the
cumulative effects of a persons' actions.

<span id="puranas"></span>

### Puranas

The Puranas are post-Vedic texts which typically contain a complete
narrative of the history of the Universe from creation to destruction,
genealogies of the kings, heroes and demigods, and descriptions of Hindu
cosmology and geography. There are 17 or 18 canonical Puranas, divided
into three categories, each named after a deity: Brahma, Vishnu and
Shiva. There are also many other works termed Purana, known as
'Upapuranas.'

### The Epics

The Mahabharata and Ramayana are the national epics of India. They are
probably the longest poems in any language. The Mahabharata, attributed
to the sage Vyasa, was written down from 540 to 300 B.C. The Mahabharata
tells the legends of the Bharatas, a Vedic Aryan group. The Ramayana,
attributed to the poet Valmiki, was written down during the first
century A.D., although it is based on oral traditions that go back six
or seven centuries earlier. The Ramayana is a moving love story with
moral and spiritual themes that has deep appeal in India to this day.

In addition, a key Hindu sacred text, the [Bhagavad Gita](#gita.md), is
embedded in Book Six of the Mahabharata.

#### Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita, usually considered part of the sixth book of the
Mahabharata (dating from about 400 or 300 B.C.), is a central text of
Hinduism, a philosphical dialog between the god Krishna and the warrior
Arjuna. This is one of the most popular and accessible of all Hindu
scriptures, required reading for anyone interested in Hinduism. The Gita
discusses selflessness, duty, devotion, and meditation, integrating many
different threads of Hindu philosophy.
