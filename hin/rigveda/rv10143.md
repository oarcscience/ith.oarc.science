Heritage

### HYMN CXLIII. Aśvins.

1\. YE made that Atri, worn with eld, free as a horse to win the goal.  
When ye restored to youth and strength Kakṣīvān like a car renewed,  
2 Ye freed that Atri like a horse, and brought him newly-born to
earth.  
Ye loosed him like a firm-tied knot which Gods unsoiled by dust had
bound.  
3 Heroes who showed most wondrous power to Atri, strive to win fair
songs;  
For then, O Heroes of the sky, your hymn of praise shall cease no
more.  
4 This claims your notice, Bounteous Gods! - oblation, Aśvins! and our
love,  
That ye, O Heroes, in the fight may bring us safe to ample room.  
5 Ye Twain to Bhujyu tossed about in ocean at the region's end,  
Nāsatyas, with your winged sterds came nigh, and gave him strength to
win.  
6 Come with your joys, most liberal Gods, Lords of all treasures,
bringing weal.  
Like fresh full waters to a well, so, Heroes come and be with us.
