### HYMN LIII. Maruts.

1\. Who knows the birth of these, or who lived in the Maruts’ favour in
the days of old  
What time their spotted deer were yoked?  
2 Who, when they stood upon their cars, hath heard them tell the way
they went?  
Who was the bounteous man to whom their kindred rains flowed down with
food of sacrifice?  
3 To me they told it, and they came with winged steeds radiant to the
draught,  
Youths, Heroes free from spot or stain: Behold us here and praise thou
us;  
4 Who shine self-luminous with ornaments and swords, with breastplates,
armlets, and with wreaths,  
Arrayed on chariots and with bows.  
5 O swift to pour your bounties down, ye Maruts, with delight I look
upon your cars,  
Like splendours coming through the rain.  
6 Munificent Heroes, they have cast heaven's treasury down for the
worshipper's behoof:  
They set the storm-cloud free to stream through both the worlds, and
rainfloods flow o’er desert spots.  
7 The bursting streams m billowy flood have spread abroad, like
milch-kine, o’er the firmament.  
Like swift steeds hasting to their journey's resting-place, to every
side run glittering brooks.  
8 Hither, O Maruts, come from heaven, from mid-air, or from near at
hand  
Tarry not far away from us.  
9 So let not Rasā, Krumu, or Anitabha, Kubha, or Sindhu hold you back.  
Let not the watery Sarayti obstruct your way. With us be all the bliss
ye give.  
10 That brilliant gathering of your cars, the company of Maruts, of the
Youthful Ones,  
The rain-showers, speeding on, attend.  
11 With eulogies and hymns may we follow your army, troop by troop, and
band by band,  
And company by company.  
12 To what oblation-giver, sprung of noble ancestry, have sped  
The Maruts on this course to-day?  
13 Vouchsafe to us the bounty, that which we implore, through which, for
child and progeny,  
Ye give the seed of corn that wasteth not away, and bliss that reacheth
to all life.  
14 May we in safety pass by those who slander us, leaving behind
disgrace and hate.  
Maruts, may we be there when ye, at dawn, in rest and toil, rain waters
down and balm.  
15 Favoured by Gods shall he the man, O Heroes, Marutr! and possessed of
noble sons,  
Whom ye protect. Such may we be.  
16 Praise the Free-givers. At this liberal patron's rite they joy like
cattle in the mead.  
So call thou unto them who come as ancient Friends: hymn those who love
thee with a song.
