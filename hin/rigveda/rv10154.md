### HYMN CLIV. New Life.

1\. FOR some is Soma purified, some sit by sacrificial oil:  
To those for whom the meath flows forth, even to those let him depart.  
2 Invincible through Fervour, those whom Fervour hath advanced to
heaven,  
Who showed great Fervour in their lives, -even to those let him
depart.  
3 The heroes who contend in war and boldly cast their lives away,  
Or who give guerdon thousandfold, -even to those let him depart.  
4 Yea, the first followers of Law, Law's pure and holy strengtheners,  
The Fathers, Yama! Fervour-moved,even to those let him depart.  
5 Skilled in a thousand ways and means, the sages who protect the Sun,  
The Ṛṣis, Yama! Fervour-moved,—even to those let him depart.
