### HYMN XXVIII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. URGED by the men, this vigorous Steed, Lord of the mind,
Omniscient,  
Runs to the woollen straining-cloth.  
2 Within the filter hath he flowed, this Soma for the Gods effused,  
Entering all their essences.  
3 He shines in beauty there, this God Immortal in his dwelling-place,  
Foe-slayer, dearest to the Gods.  
4 Directed by the Sisters ten, bellowing on his way this Steer  
Runs onward to the wooden vats.  
5 This Pavamana, swiftand strong, Omniscient, gave spleudour to  
The Sun and all his forms of light.  
6 This Soma being purified, flows mighty and infallible,  
Slayer of sinners, dear toGods.
