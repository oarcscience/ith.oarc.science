### HYMN LVIII. Maruts.

1\. SING to the troop that pours down rain in common, the Mighty Company
of celestial nature.  
They make the world-halves tremble with their greatness: from depths of
earth and sky they reach to heaven.  
2 Yea, your birth, Maruts, was with wild commotion, ye who move swiftly,
fierce in wrath, terrific.  
Ye all-surpassing in your might and vigour, each looker on the light
fears at your coming.  
3 Give ample vital power unto our princes let our fair praises gratify
the Maruts.  
As the way travelled helpeth people onward, so further us with your
delightful succours.  
4 Your favoured singer counts his wealth by hundreds: the strong steed
whom ye favour wins a thousand.  
The Sovran whom ye aid destroys the foeman. May this your gift, ye
Shakers, be distinguished.  
5 I call, as such, the Sons of bounteous Rudra: will not the Maruts turn
again to us-ward?  
What secret sin or open stirs their anger, that we implore the Swift
Ones to forgive us.  
6 This eulogy of the Bounteous hath been spoken: accept, ye Maruts, this
our hymn of praises.  
Ye Bulls, keep those who hate us at a distance. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
