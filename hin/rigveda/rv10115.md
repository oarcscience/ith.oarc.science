### HYMN CXV. Agni.

1\. VERILY wondrous is the tender Youngling's growth who never draweth
nigh to drink his Mothers' milk.  
As soon as she who hath no udder bore him, he, faring on his great
errand, suddenly grew strong.  
2 Then Agni was his name, most active to bestow, gathering up the trees
with his consuming tooth;  
Skilled in fair sacrifice, armed with destroying tongue, impetuous as a
bull that snorteth in the mead.  
3 Praise him, yourGod who, bird-like, rests upon a tree, scattering
drops of juice and pouring forth his flood,  
Speaking aloud with flame as with his lips a priest, and broadening his
paths like one of high command.  
4 Thou Everlasting, whom, far-striding fain to burn, the winds,
uninterrupted, never overcome,  
They have approached, as warriors eager for the fight, heroic Trita,
guiding him to gain his wish.  
5 This Agni is the best of Kaṇvas, Kaṇvas' Friend, Conqueror of the foe
whether afar or near.  
May Agni guard the singers, guard the princes well: may Agni grant to us
our princes' gracious help.  
6 Do thou, Supitrya, swiftly following, make thyself the lord of
Jātavedas, mightiest of all,  
Who surely gives a boon even in thirsty land most powerful, prepared to
aid us in the wilds.  
7 Thus noble Agni with princes and mortal men is lauded, excellent for
conquering strength with chiefs,  
Men who are well-disposed as friends and true to Law, even as the
heavens in majesty surpass mankind.  
8 O Son of Strength, Victorious, with this title Upastuta's most potent
voice reveres thee.  
Blest with brave sons by thee we will extol thee, and lengthen out the
days of our existence.  
9 Thus, Agni, have the sons of Vrstihavya, the Ṛṣis, the Upastutas
invoked thee.  
Protect them, guard the singers and the princes. With Vaṣaṭ! have they
come, with hands uplifted, with their uplifted hands and cries of Glory!
