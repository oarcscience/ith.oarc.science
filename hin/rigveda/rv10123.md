### HYMN CXXIII. Vena.

1\. SEE, Vena, born in light, hath driven hither, on chariot of the air,
the Calves of Pṛśni.  
Singers with hymns caress him as an infant there where the waters and
the sunlight mingle.  
2 Vena draws up his wave from out the ocean. mist-born, the fair one's
back is made apparent,  
Brightly he shone aloft on Order's summit: the hosts sang glory to their
common birthplace.  
3 Full many, lowing to their joint-possession, dwelling together stood
the Darling's Mothers.  
Ascending to the lofty height of Order, the bands of singers 'sip the
sweets of Amṛta.  
4 Knowing his form, the sages yearned to meet him: they have come nigh
to hear the wild Bull's bellow.  
Performing sacrifice they reached the river: for the Gandharva found the
immortal waters.  
5 The Apsaras, the Lady, sweetly smiling, supports her Lover in
sublimest heaven.  
In his Friend's dwelling as a Friend he wanders: he, Vena, rests him on
his golden pinion.  
6 They gaze on thee with longing in their spirit, as on a strong-winged
bird that mounteth sky-ward;  
On thee with wings of gold, Varuṇa's envoy, the Bird that hasteneth to
the home of Yama.  
7 Erect, to heaven hath the Gandharva mounted, pointing at us his
many-coloured weapons;  
Clad in sweet raiment beautiful to look on, for he, as light, produceth
forms that please us.  
8 When as a spark he cometh near the ocean, still looking with a
vulture's eye to heaven,  
His lustre, joying in its own bright splendour, maketh dear glories in
the lowest region.
