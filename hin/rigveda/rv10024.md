### HYMN XXIV. Indra. Aśvins.

1\. O INDRA, drink this Soma, pressed out in the mortar, full of
sweets.  
Send down to us great riches,—at your glad carouse-in thousands, O Most
healthy. Thou art waxing great.  
2 To thee with sacrifices, with oblations, and with lauds we come.  
Lord of all strength and power, grant-at your glad carouse-the best
choiceworthy treasure. Thou art waxing great.  
3 Thou who art Lord of precious boons, inciter even of the churl.  
Guardian of singers, Indra,—at your glad carouse-save us from woe and
hatred. Thou art waxing great.  
4 Strong, Lords of Magic power, ye Twain churned the united worlds
apart,  
When ye, implored by Vimada, Nāsatyas, forced apart the pair.  
5 When the united pair were rent asunder all the Gods complained.  
The Gods to the Nāsatyas cried, Bring these together once again.  
6 Sweet be my going forth, and rich in sweets be my approach to home.  
So, through your Deity, both Gods, enrich us with all pleasantness.
