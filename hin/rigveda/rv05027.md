Heritage

### HYMN XXVII. Agni.

1\. THE Godlike hero, famousest of nobles, hath granted me two oxen with
a wagon.  
Trvrsan's son Tryaruna hath distinguished himself, Vaiśvānara Agni! with
ten thousands.  
2 Protect Tryaruna, as thou art waxing strong and art highly praised,
Vaiśvānara Agni!  
Who granteth me a hundred kine and twenty, and two bay horses, good at
draught, and harnessed.  
3 So Trasadasyu served thee, God Most Youthful, craving thy favour for
the ninth time, Agni;  
Tryaruya who with attentive spirit accepteth many a song from me the
mighty.  
4 He who declares his wish to me, to Asvamedha, to the Prince,  
Pays him who with his verse seeks gain, gives power to him who keeps the
Law.  
5 From whom a hundred oxen, all of speckled hue, delight my heart,  
The gifts of Asvamedha, like thrice-mingled draughts of Soma juice.  
6 To Asvamedha who bestows a hundred gifts grant hero power,  
O Indra-Agni! lofty rule like the unwasting Sun in heaven.
