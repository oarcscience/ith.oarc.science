### HYMN IV. Soma Pavamana.

1\. O Soma flowing on thy way, win thou and conquer high renown;  
And make us better than we are.  
2 Win thou the light, win heavenly light, and, Soma, all felicities;  
And make us better than we are.  
3 Win skilful strength and mental power. O Soma, drive away our foes;  
And make us better than we are.  
4 Ye purifiers, purify Soma for Indra, for his drink:  
Make thou us better than we are.  
5 Give us our portion in the Sun through thine own mental power and
aids;  
And make us better than we are.  
6 Through thine own mental power and aid long may we look upon the
Sun;  
Make thou us better than we are.  
7 Well-weaponed Soma, pour to usa stream of riches doubly great;  
And make us better than we are.  
8 As one victorious unsubdued in battle pour forth wealth to us;  
And make us better than we are.  
9 By worship, Pavamana! men have strengthened thee to prop the Law:  
Make thou us better than we are.  
10 O Indu, bring us wealth in steeds, manifold. quickening all life;  
And mate us better than we are.
