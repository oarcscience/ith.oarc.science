### HYMN XCVI. Sarasvatī.

1\. I SING a lofty song, for she is mightiest, most divine of Streams.  
Sarasvatī will I exalt with hymns and lauds, and, O Vasiṣṭha, Heaven and
Earth.  
2 When in the fulness of their strength the Pūrus dwell, Beauteous One,
on thy two grassy banks,  
Favour us thou who hast the Maruts for thy friends: stir up the bounty
of our chiefs.  
3 So may Sarasvatī auspicious send good luck; she, rich in spoil, is
never niggardly in thought,  
When praised in jamadagni's way and lauded as Vasiṣṭha lauds.  
4 We call upon Sarasvān, as unmarried men who long for wives,  
As liberal men who yearn for sons.  
5 Be thou our kind protector, O Sarasvān, with those waves of thine  
Laden with sweets and dropping oil.  
6 May we enjoy Sarasvān's breast, all-beautiful, that swells with
streams,  
May we gain food and progeny.
