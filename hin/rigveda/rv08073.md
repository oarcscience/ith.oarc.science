### HYMN LXXIII. Agni.

1\. AGNI, your dearest Guest, I laud, him who is loving as a friend,  
Who brings us riches like a car.  
2 Whom as a far-foreseeing Sage the Gods have, from the olden time,  
Established among mortal men.  
3 Do thou, Most Youthful God, protect the men who offer, hear their
songs,  
And of thyself preserve their seed.  
4 What is the praise wherewith, O God, Aṅgiras, Agni, Son of Strength,  
We, after thine own wish and thought,  
5 May serve thee, O thou Child of Power, and with what sacrifice's
plan?  
What prayer shall I now speak to thee?  
6 Our God, make all of us to dwell in happy habitations, and  
Reward our songs with spoil and wealth.  
7 Lord of the house, what plenty fills the songs which thou inspirest
now,  
Thou whose hymn helps to win the kine?  
8 Hirn Wise and Strong they glorify, the foremost Champion in the
fray,  
And mighty in his dwelling-place.  
9 Agni, he dwells in rest and peace who smites and no one smites
again:  
With hero sons he prospers well
