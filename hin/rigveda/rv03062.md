### HYMN LXII. Indra and Others.

1\. YOUR well-known prompt activities aforetime needed no impulse from
your faithful servant.  
Where, Indra-Varuṇa, is now that glory wherewith ye brought support to
those who loved you?  
2 This man, most diligent, seeking after riches, incessantly invokes you
for your favour.  
Accordant, Indra-Varuṇa, with Maruts, with Heaven and Earth, hear ye
mine invocation.  
3 O Indra-Varuṇa, ours be this treasure ours be wealth, Maruts, with
full store of heroes.  
May the Varūtrīs with their shelter aid us, and Bhāratī and Hotrā with
the Mornings.  
4 Be pleased! with our oblations, thou loved of all Gods, Bṛhaspati:  
Give wealth to him who brings thee gifts.  
5 At sacrifices, with your hymns worship the pure Bṛhaspati—  
I pray for power which none may bend—  
6 The Bull of men, whom none deceive, the wearer of each shape at
will,  
Bṛhaspati Most Excellent.  
7 Divine, resplendent Pūṣan, this our newest hymn of eulogy,  
By us is chanted forth to thee.  
8 Accept with favour this my song, be gracious to the earnest thought,  
Even as a bridegroom to his bride.  
9 May he who sees all living things, see, them together at a glance,—  
May he, may Pūṣan be our help.  
10 May we attain that excellent glory of Savitar the God:  
So May he stimulate our prayers.  
11 With understanding, earnestly, of Savitar the God we crave  
Our portion of prosperity.  
12 Men, singers worship Savitar the God with hymn and holy rites,  
Urged by the impulse of their thoughts.  
13 Soma who gives success goes forth, goes to the gathering place of
Gods,  
To seat him at the seat of Law.  
14 To us and to our cattle may Soma give salutary food,  
To biped and to quadruped.  
15 May Soma, strengthening our power of life, and conquering our foes,  
In our assembly take his seat.  
16 May Mitra-Varuṇa, sapient Pair, bedew our pasturage with oil,  
With meatb the regions of the air.  
17 Far-ruling, joyful when adored, ye reign through majesty of might,  
With pure laws everlastingly.  
18 Lauded by Jamadagni's song, sit in the place of holy Law:
