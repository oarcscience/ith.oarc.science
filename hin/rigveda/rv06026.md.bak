### HYMN XXVI. Indra.

1\. O INDRA, hear us. Raining down the Soma, we call on thee to win us
mighty valour.  
Give us strong succour on the day of trial, when the tribes gather on
the field of battle.  
2 The warrior, son of warrior sire, invokes thee, to gain great strength
that may be won as booty:  
To thee, the brave man's Lord, the fiends' subduer, he looks when
fighting hand to hand for cattle.  
3 Thou didst impel the sage to win the daylight, didst ruin Śuṣṇa for
the pious Kutsa.  
The invulnerable demon's head thou clavest when thou wouldst win the
praise of Atithigva.  
4 The lofty battle-car thou broughtest forward; thou holpest Dasadyu the
strong when fighting.  
Along with Vetasu thou slewest Tugra, and madest Tuji strong, who
praised thee, Indra.  
5 Thou madest good the laud, what time thou rentest a hundred thousand
fighting foes, O Hero,  
Slewest the Dāsa Śambara of the mountain, and with strange aids didst
succour Divodāsa.  
6 Made glad with Soma-draughts and faith, thou sentest Cumuri to his
sleep, to please Dabhīti.  
Thou, kindly giving Raji to Pithinas, slewest with might, at once, the
sixty thousand.  
7 May I too, with the liberal chiefs, O Indra, acquire thy blin supreme
and domination,  
When, Mightiest! Hero-girt! Nahuṣa heroes boast them in thee, the
triply-strong Defender.  
8 So may we he thy friends, thy best beloved, O Indra, at this holy
invocation.  
Best be Pratardani, illustrious ruler, in slaying foemen and in gaining
riches.
