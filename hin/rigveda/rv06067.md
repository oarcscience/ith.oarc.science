### HYMN LXVIL Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. NOW Mitra-Varuṇa shall be exalted high by your songs, noblest of all
existing;  
They who, as ’twere with reins are best Controllers, unequalled with
their arms to check the people.  
2 To you Two Gods is this my thought extended, turned to the sacred
grass with loving homage.  
Give us, O Mitra-Varuṇa, a dwelling safe from attack, which ye shall
guard, Boon-Givers!  
3 Come hither, Mitra-Varuṇa, invited with eulogies and loving
adoration,  
Ye who with your might, as Work-Controllers, urge even men who quickly
hear to labour.  
4 Whom, of pure origin, like two strong horses, Aditi bore as babes in
proper season,  
Whom, Mighty at your birth, the Mighty Goddess brought forth as terrors
to the mortal foeman.  
5 As all the Gods in their great joy and gladness gave you with one
accord your high dominion,  
As ye surround both worlds, though wide and spacious your spies are ever
true and never bewildered.  
6 So, through the days maintaining princely power. ye prop the height as
’twere from loftiest heaven.  
The Star of all the Gods, established, filleth the heaven and earth with
food of man who liveth.  
7 Take the strong drink, to quaff till ye are sated, when he and his
attendants fill the chamber.  
The young Maids brook not that none seeks to win them, when, Quickeners
of all! they scatter moisture.  
8 So with your tongue come ever, when your envoy, faithful and very
wise, attends our worship.  
Nourished by holy oil! he this yGur glory: annihilate the sacrificer's
trouble.  
9 When, Mitra-Varuṇa, they strive against you and break tlie friendly
laws ye have established,  
They, neither Gods nor men in estimation, like Api's sons have godless
sacrifices.  
10 When singers in their song uplift their voices, some chant the Nivid
texts with steady purpose.  
Then may we sing you lauds that shall be fruitful: dp ye not rival all
the Gods in greatness?  
11 O Mitra-Varuṇa, may your large bounty come to us hither, near to this
our dwelling,  
When the kine haste to us, and when they harness the fleet-foot mettled
stallion for the battle.
