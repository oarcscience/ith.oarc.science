### HYMN XC. Viśvedevas.

1\. MAY Varuṇa with guidance straight, and Mitra lead us, he who
knows,  
And Aryaman in accord with Gods.  
2 For they are dealers forth of wealth, and, not deluded, with their
might  
Guard evermore the holy laws.  
3 Shelter may they vouchsafe to us, Immortal Gods to mortal men,  
Chasing our enemies away.  
4 May they mark out our paths to bliss, Indra, the Maruts, Pūṣan,  
and Bhaga, the Gods to be adored.  
5 Yea, Pūṣan, Viṣṇu, ye who run your course, enrich our hymns with
kine;  
Bless us with all prosperity.  
6 The winds waft sweets, the rivers pour sweets for the man who keeps
the Law  
So may the plants be sweet for us.  
7 Sweet be the night and sweet the dawns, sweet the terrestrial
atmosphere;  
Sweet be our Father Heaven to us.  
8 May the tall tree be full of sweets for us, and full of sweets the
Sun:  
May our milch-kine be sweet for us.  
9 Be Mitra gracious unto us, and Varuṇa and Aryaman:  
Indra, Bṛhaspati be kind, and Viṣṇu of the mighty stride.
