### HYMN LXIII. Agni.

1\. EXERTING all our strength with thoughts of power we glorify in
speech  
Agni your dear familiar Friend, the darling Guest in every home.  
2 Whom, served with sacrificial oil like Mitra, men presenting gifts  
Eulogize with their songs of praise  
3 Much-lauded Jātavedas, him who bears oblations up to heaven  
Prepared in service of the Gods.  
4 To noblest Agni, Friend of man, best Vṛtra-slayer, are we come,  
Him in whose presence Rksa's son, mighty Srutarvan, waxes great;  
5 To deathless Jātavedas, meet for praise, adored, with sacred oil,  
Visible through the gloom of night  
6 Even Agni whom these priestly men worship with sacrificial gifts,  
With lifted ladles offering them.  
7 O Agni, this our newest hymn hath been addressed from us to thee,  
O cheerful Guest, well-born, most wise, worker of wonders, ne’er
deceived.  
8 Agni, may it be dear to thee, most grateful, and exceeding sweet:  
Grow mightier, eulogized therewith.  
9 Splendid with splendours may it be, and in the battle with the foe  
Add loftier glory to thy fame.  
10 Steed, cow, a lord of heroes, bright like Indra, who shall fill the
car.  
Whose high renown ye celebrate, and people praise each glorious deed.  
11 Thou whom Gopavana made glad with song, O Agni Aṅgiras,  
Hear this my call, thou Holy One.  
12 Thou whom the priestly folk implore to aid the gathering of the
spoil,  
Such be thou in the fight with foes.  
13 I, called to him who reels with joy, Srutarvan, Rksa's son, shall
stroke  
The heads of four presented steeds, like the long wool of fleecy rams.  
14 Four coursers with a splendid car, Savistha's horses, fleet of
foot,  
Shall bring me to the sacred feast, as flying steeds brought Tugra's
son.  
15 The very truth do I declare to thee, Paruṣṇī, mighty flood.  
Waters! no man is there who gives more horses than Savistha gives.
