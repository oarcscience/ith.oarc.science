### HYMN LXXXIT. Indra-Varuṇa

1\. GRANT us your strong protection, IndraVaruṇa, our people, and our
family, for sacrifice.  
May we subdue in fight our evil-hearted foes, him who attacks the man
steadfast in lengthened rites.  
2 O Indra-Varuṇa, mighty and very rich One of you is called Monarch and
One Autocrat.  
All Gods in the most lofty region of the air have, O ye Steers, combined
all power and might in you.  
3 Ye with your strength have pierced the fountains of the floods: the
Sun have ye brought forward as the Lord in heaven.  
Cheered by this magic draught ye, Indra-Varuṇa, made the dry places
stream, made songs of praise flow forth.  
4 In battels and in frays we ministering priests, kneeling upon our
knees for furtherance of our weal,  
Invoke you, only you, the Lords of twofold wealth, you prompt to hear,
we bards, O Indra-Varuṇa.  
5 O Indra-Varuṇa, as ye created all these creatures of the world by your
surpassing might,  
In peace and quiet Mitra waits on Varuṇa, the Other, awful, with the
Maruis seeks renown.  
6 That Varuṇa's high worth may shine preeminent, these Twain have
measured each his proper power and might.  
The One subdueth the destructive enemy; the Other with a few furthereth
many a man.  
7 No trouble, no misfortune, Indra-Varuṇa, no woe from any side assails
the mortal man  
Whose sacrifice, O Gods, ye visit and enjoy: ne’er doth the crafty guile
of mortal injure him.  
8 With your divine protection, Heroes, come to us: mine invncation hear,
if ye be pleased therewith.  
Bestow ye upon us, O Indra-Varuṇa, your friendship and your kinship and
your favouring grace.  
9 In battle after battle, Indra-Varuṇa, be ye our Champions, ye who are
the peoples' strength,  
When both opposing bands invoke you for the fight, and men that they may
gain offspring and progeny.  
10 May Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman vouchsafe us glory and great
shelter spreading far.  
We think of the beneficent light of Aditi, and Savitar's song of praise,
the God who strengthens Law.
