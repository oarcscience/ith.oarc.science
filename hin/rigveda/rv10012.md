### HYMN XII. Agni

1\. HEAVEN and Earth, first by everlasting Order, speakers of truth, are
near enough to hear us,  
When the God, urging men to worship. sitteth as Priest, assuming all his
vital vigour.  
2 As God comprising Gods by Law Eternal, bear, as the Chief who knoweth,
our oblation,  
Smoke-bannered with the fuel, radiant, joyous, better to praise and
worship, Priest for ever.  
3 When the cow's nectar wins the God completely, men here below are
heaven's sustainers.  
All the Gods came to this thy heavenly Yajus which from the motley Pair
milked oil and water.  
4 1 praise your work that ye may make me prosper: hear, Heaven and
Earth, Twain Worlds that drop with fatness.  
While days and nights go to the world of spirits, here let the Parents
with sweet meath refresh us  
5 Hath the King siezed us? How have we offended against his holy
ordinance? Who knoweth?  
For even Mitra mid the Gods is angry there are both song and strength
for those who come not.  
6 ’Tis hard to understand the Immortal's nature, where she who is akin
becomes astranger.  
Guard ceaselessly, great Agni, him who ponders Yama's name, easy to be
comprehended.  
7 They in the synod where the Gods rejoice them, where they are seated
in Vivasvān's dwelling,  
Have given the Moon his beams, the Sun his splendour-the Two unweariedly
maintain their brightness.  
8 The counsel which the Gods meet to consider, their secret plan,—of
that we have no knowledge.  
There let God Savitar, Aditi, and Mitra proclaim to Varuṇa that we are
sinless.  
9 Hear us, O Agni, in your comninn dwell ing: harness thy rapid car, the
car of Amṛta.  
Bring Heaven and Earth, the Deities' Parents, hither: stay with us here,
nor from the Gods be distant.
