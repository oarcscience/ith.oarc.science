### HYMN V. Agni.

1\. How shall we give with one accord oblation to Agni, to Vaiśvānara
the Bounteous?  
Great light, with full high growth hath he uplifted, and, as a pillar
bears the roof, sustains it.  
2 Reproach not him who, God and self-reliant, vouchsafed this bounty
unto me a mortal,—  
Deathless, discerner, wise, to me the simple, Vaiśvānara most manly,
youthful Agni.  
3 Sharp-pointed, powerful, strong, of boundless vigour, Agni who knows
the lofty hymn, kept secret  
As the lost milch-cow's track, the doubly Mighty,—he hath declared to me
this hidden knowledge.  
4 May he with sharpened teeth, the Bounteous Giver, Agni, consume with
flame most fiercely glowing.  
Those who regard not Varuṇa's commandments and the dear stedfast laws of
sapient Mitra.  
5 Like youthful women without brothers, straying, like dames who hate
their lords, of evil conduct,  
They who are full of sin, untrue, unfaithful, they have engendered this
abysmal station.  
6 To me, weak, innocent, thou, luminous Agni, hast boldly given as
’twere a heavy burthen,  
This Pṛṣṭha hymn, profound and strong and mighty, of seven elements, and
with offered dainties.  
7 So may our song that purifies, through wisdom reach in a moment him
the Universal,  
Established on the height, on earth's best station, above the beauteous
grassy skin of Pṛśni.  
8 Of this my speech what shall I utter further? They indicate the milk
stored up in secret  
When they have thrown as ’twere the cows' stalls open. The Bird protects
earths’ best and well-loved station.  
9 This is the Great Ones’ mighty apparition which from of old the
radiant Cow hath followed.  
This, shining brightly in the place of Order, swift, hasting on in
secret, she discovered.  
10 He then who shone together with his Parents remembered Pṛśni's fair
and secret treasure,  
Which, in the Mother Cow's most lofty station, the Bull's tongue, of the
flame bent forward, tasted.  
11 With reverence I declare the Law, O Agni; what is, comes by thine
order, Jātavedas.  
Of this, whate’er it be, thou art the Sovran, yea, all the wealth that
is in earth or  
heaven.  
12 What is our wealth therefrom, and what our treasure? Tell us O
Jātavedas, for thou  
knowest,  
What is our best course in this secret passage: we, unreproached, have
reached a place far distant.  
13 What is the limit, what the rules, the guerdon? Like fleet-foot
coursers speed we to the contest.  
When will the Goddesses, the Immortal's Spouses, the Dawns, spread over
us the Sun-God's splendour?  
14 Unsatisfied, with speech devoid of vigour, scanty and frivolous and
inconclusive,  
Wherefore do they address thee here, O Agni? Let these who have no
weapons suffer sorrow.  
15 The majesty of him the Good, the Mighty, aflame, hath shone for glory
in the dwelling.  
He, clothed in light, hath shone most fair to look on, wealthy in boons,
as a home shines with riches.
