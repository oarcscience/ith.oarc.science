### HYMN VIII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. OBEYING Indra's dear desire these Soma juices have flowed forth,  
Increasing his heroic might.  
2 Laid in the bowl, pure-flowing on to Vāyu and the Aśvins, may  
These give us great heroic strength.  
3 Soma, as thou art purified, incite to bounty Indra's heart,  
To sit in place of sacrifice.  
4 The ten swift fingers deck thee forth, seven ministers impel thee
on:  
The sages have rejoiced in thee.  
5 When through the filter thou art poured, we clothe thee with a robe of
milk  
To be a gladdening draught for Gods.  
6 When purified within the jars, Soma, brightred and golden-hued,  
Hath clothed him with a robe of milk.  
7 Flow on to us and make us rich. Drive all our enemies away.  
O Indu, flow into thy Friend.  
Send down the rain from heaven, a stream of opulence from earth. Give
us,  
O Soma, victory in war.  
9 May we obtain thee, Indra's drink, who viewest men and findest
light,  
Gain thee, and progeny and food.
