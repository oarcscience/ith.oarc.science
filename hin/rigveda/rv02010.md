### HYMN X. Agni.

1\. AGNI, first, loudly calling, like a Father, kindled by man upon the
seat of worship.  
Clothed in his glory, deathless, keen of insight, must be adorned by
all, the Strong, the Famous.  
2 May Agni the resplendent hear my calling through all my songs,
Immortal, keen of insight.  
Dark steeds or ruddy draw his car, or carried in sundry ways he makes
them red of colour.  
3 On wood supine they got the well-formed Infant: a germ in
various-fashioned plants was Agni;  
And in the night, not compassed round by darkness, he dwells exceeding
wise, with rays of splendour.  
4 With oil and sacred gifts I sprinkle Agni who makes his home in front
of all things living,  
Broad, vast, through vital power o’er all expanded, conspicuous, strong
with all the food that feeds him.  
5 I pour to him who looks in all directions: may he accept it with a
friendly spirit.  
Agni with bridegroom's grace and lovely colour may not be touched when
all his form is fury.  
6 By choice victorious, recognize thy portion: with thee for envoy may
we speak like Manu.  
Obtaining wealth, I call on perfect Agni who with an eloquent tongue
dispenses sweetness.
