### HYMN L. Indra.

1\. BOTH boons,—may Indra, hitherward turned, listen to this prayer of
ours,  
And mightiest Maghavan with thought inclined to us come near to drink
the Soma juice.  
2 For him, strong, independent Ruler, Heaven and Earth have fashioned
forth for power and might.  
Thou seatest thee as first among thy peers in place, for thy soul longs
for Soma juice.  
3 Fill thyself full, O Lord of wealth, O Indra, with the juice we
shed.  
We know thee, Lord of Bay Steeds victor in the fight, vanquishing e’en
the invincible.  
4 Changeless in truth, O Maghavan Indra, let it be as thou in wisdom
willest it.  
May we, O fair of check, win booty with thine aid, O Thunderer, swiftly
seeking it.  
5 Indra, with all thy saving helps give us assistance, Lord of power.  
For after thee we follow even as glorious bliss, thee, Hero, finder-out
of wealth.  
6 Increaser of our steeds and multiplying kine, a golden well, O God,
art thou,  
For no one may impair the gifts laid up in thee. Bring me whatever thing
I ask.  
7 For thou,—come to the worshipper!—wilt find great wealth to make us
rich.  
Fill thyself full, O Maghavan, for gain of kine, full, Indra, for the
gain of steeds.  
8 Thou as thy gift bestowest many hundred herds, yea, many thousands
dost thou give.  
With singers' hymns have we brought the Fort-render near, singing to
Indra for his grace.  
9 Whether the simple or the sage, Indra, have offered praise to thee,  
He Śatakratu! by his love hath gladdened thee, ambitious! ever pressing
on!  
10 If he the Strong of arm, the breaker-down of forts, the great
Destroyer, hear my call,  
We, seeking riches cry to Indra, Lord of wealth, to Śatakratu with our
lauds.  
11 We count not then as sinners, nor as niggardly or foolish men,  
When with the Soma juice which we have shed we make Indra, the Mighty
One, our Friend.  
12 Him have we yoked in fight, the powerful Conqueror, debt-claimer, not
to be deceived.  
Best charioteer, the Victor marks each fault, he knows the strong to
whom he will come near.  
13 Indra, give us security from that whereof we are afraid.  
Help us, O Maghavan, let thy succour give us this: drive away foes and
enemies.  
14 For thou, O liberal Lord of bounty, strengthenest his ample home who
worships thee.  
So Indra, Maghavan, thou Lover of the Song, we with pressed Soma call on
thee,  
15 Indra is Vṛtra-slayer, guard, our best defender from the foe.  
May he preserve our last and middlemost, and keep watch from behind us
and before.  
16 Defend us from behind, below, above, in front, on all sides, Indra,
shield us well.  
Keep far away from us the terror sent from heaven: keep impious weapons
far away.  
17 Protect us, Indra, each to-day, each morrow, and each following
day.  
Our singers, through all days, shalt thou, Lord of the brave, keep
safely both by day and night.  
18 A crushing Warrior, passing rich is Maghavan, endowed with all heroic
might.  
Thine arms, O Śatakratu, are exceeding strong, arms which have grasped
the thunderbolt.
