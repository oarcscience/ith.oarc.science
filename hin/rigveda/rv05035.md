### HYMN XXXV. Indra.

1\. INDRA, for our assistance bring that most effectual power of
thine,  
Which conquers men for us, and wins the spoil, invincible in fight.  
2 Indra, whatever aids be thine, four be they, or, O Hero, three,  
Or those of the Five Tribes of men, bring quickly all that help to us.  
3 The aid most excellent of thee the Mightiest hitherward we call,  
For thou wast born with hero might, conquering, Indra, with the
Strong.  
4 Mighty to prosper us wast thou born, and mighty is the strength thou
hast.  
In native power thy soul is firm: thy valour, Indra, slays a host.  
5 O Śatakratu, Lord of Strength, O Indra, Caster of the Stone.  
With all thy chariot's force assail the man who shows himself thy foe.  
6 For, Mightiest Vṛtra-slayer, thee, fierce, foremost among many, folk  
Whose sacred grass is trimmed invite to battle where the spoil is won.  
7 Indra, do thou protect our car that mingles foremost in the fights,  
That bears its part in every fray, invincible and seeking spoil.  
8 Come to us, Indra, and protect our car with thine intelligence.  
May we, O Mightiest One, obtain excellent fame at break of day, and
meditate our hymn at dawn.
