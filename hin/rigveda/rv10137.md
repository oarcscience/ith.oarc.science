### HYMN CXXXVII Viśvedevas.

1\. YE Gods, raise up once more the man whom ye have humbled and brought
low.  
O Gods, restore to life again the man who hatb committed sin.  
2 Two several winds are blowing here, from Sindhu, from a distant
land.  
May one breathe energy to thee, the other blow disease away.  
3 Hither, O Wind, blow healing balm, blow all disease away, thou Wind;  
For thou who hast all medicine comest as envoy of the Gods.  
4 I am come nigh to thee with balms to give thee rest and keep thee
safe.  
I bring thee blessed strength, I drive thy weakening malady away.  
5 Here let the Gods deliver him, the Maruts’ band deliver him:  
All things that be deliver him that he be freed from his disease.  
6 The Waters have their healing power, the Waters drive disease away.  
The Waters have a balm for all: let them make medicine for thee.  
7 The tongue that leads the voice precedes. Then with our ten-fold
branching hands,  
With these two chasers of disease we stroke thee with a gentle touch.
