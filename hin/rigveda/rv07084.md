### HYMN LXXXIV. Indra-Varuṇa.

1\. KINGS, Indra-Varuṇa, I would turn you hither to this our sacrifice
with gifts and homage.  
Held in both arms the ladle, dropping fatness, goes of itself to you
whose forms are varied.  
2 Dyaus quickens and promotes your high dominion who bind with bonds not
wrought of rope or cordage.  
Far from us still be Varuṇa's displeasure may Indra give us spacious
room to dwell in.  
3 Make ye our sacrifice fair amid the assemblies: make ye our prayers
approved among our princes.  
May God-sent riches come for our possession: further ye us with your
delightful succours.  
4 O Indra-Varuṇa, vouchsafe us riches with store of treasure, food, and
every blessing;  
For the Āditya, banisher of falsehood, the Hero, dealeth wealth in
boundless plenty.  
5 May this my song reach Varuṇa and Indra, and, strongly urging, win me
sons and offspring.  
To the Gods’ banquet may we go with riches. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
