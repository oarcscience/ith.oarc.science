Heritage

### HYMN CXXX. Creation.

1\. THE sacrifice drawn out with threads on every side, stretched by a
hundred sacred ministers and one,—  
This do these Fathers weave who hitherward are come: they sit beside the
warp and cry, Weave forth, weave back.  
2 The Man extends it and the Man unbinds it: even to this vault of
heaven hath he outspun, it.  
These pegs are fastened to the seat of worship: they made the Sāma-hymns
their weaving shuttles.  
3 What were the rule, the order and the model? What were the wooden
fender and the butter?  
What were the hymn, the chant, the recitation, when to the God all
Deities paid worship?  
4 Closely was Gāyatrī conjoined with Agni, and closely Savitar combined
with Usnih.  
Brilliant with Ukthas, Soma joined Anustup: Bṛhaspati's voice by Brhati
was aided.  
5 Virāj adhered to Varuṇa and Mitra: here Triṣṭup day by day was Indra's
portion.  
Jagatī entered all the Gods together: so by this knowledge men were
raised to Ṛṣis.  
6 So by this knowledge men were raised to Ṛṣis, when ancient sacrifice
sprang up, our Fathers.  
With the mind's eye I think that I behold them who first performed this
sacrificial worship.  
7 They who were versed in ritual and metre, in hymns and rules, were the
Seven Godlike Ṛṣis.  
Viewing the path of those of old, the sages have taken up the reins like
chariot-drivers.
