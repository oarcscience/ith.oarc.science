### HYMN LXXIII. Aśvins.

1\. WE have o’erpassed the limit of this darkness while, worshipping the
Gods, we sang their praises.  
The song invoketh both Immortal Aśvins far-reaching, born of old, great
WonderWorkers.  
2 And, O Nāsatyas, man's dear Priest is seated, who brings to sacrifice
and offers worship,  
Be near and taste the pleasant juice, O Aśvins: with food, I call you to
the sacrifices.  
3 We choosing you, have let our worship follow its course: ye Steers,
accept this hymn with favour.  
Obeying you as your appointed servant, Vasiṣṭha singing hath with lauds
aroused you.  
4 And these Two Priests come nigh unto our people, united,
demon-slayers, mighty-handed.  
The juices that exhilarate are mingled. Injure us not, but come with
happy fortune.  
5 Come from the west, come from the cast, Nāsatyas, come, Aśvins, from
below and from above us.  
Bring wealth from all sides for the Fivefold People. Preserve us
evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
