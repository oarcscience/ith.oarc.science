### HYMN CXXVII Agni.

1\. AGNI I hold as herald, the munificent, the gracious, Son of
Strength, who knoweth all that live, as holy Singer, knowing all,  
Lord of fair rites, a God with form erected turning to the Gods,  
He, when the flame hath sprung forth from the holy oil, the offered
fatness, longeth for it with his glow.  
2 We, sacrificing, call on thee best worshipper, the eldest of
Aṅgirases, Singer, with hymns, thee, brilliant One! with singers’
hymns;  
Thee, wandering round as ’t were the sky, who art the invoking Priest of
men,  
Whom, Bull with hair of flame the people must observe, the people that
he speed them on.  
3 He with his shining glory blazing far and wide, he verily it is who
slayeth demon foes, slayeth the demons like an axe:  
At whose close touch things solid shake, and what is stable yields like
trees.  
Subduing all, he keeps his ground and flinches not, from the skilled
archer flinches not.  
4 To him, as one who knows, even things solid yield: unrough fire-sticks
heated hot he gives his gifts to aid. Men offer Agni gifts for aid.  
He deeply piercing many a thing hews it like wood with fervent glow.  
Even hard and solid food he crunches with his might, yea, hard and solid
food with might.  
5 Here near we place the sacrificial food for him who shines forth
fairer in the night than in the day, with life then stronger than by
day.  
His life gives sure and firm defence as that one giveth to a son.  
The during fires enjoy things given and things not given, the during
fires enjoy as food.  
6 He, roaring very loudly like the Maruts’ host, in fertile cultivated
fields adorable, in desert spots adorable,  
Accepts and eats our offered gifts, ensign of sacrifice by desert;  
So let all, joying, love his path when he is glad, as men pursue a path
for bliss.  
7 Even as they who sang forth hymns, addressed to heaven, the Bhṛgus
with their prayer and praise invited him, the Bhṛgus rubbing, offering
gifts.  
For radiant Agni, Lord of all these treasures, is exceeding strong.  
May he, the wise, accept the grateful coverings, the wise accept the
coverings.  
8 Thee we invoke, the Lord of all our settled homes, common to all, the
household's guardian, to enjoy, bearer of true hymns, to enjoy.  
Thee we invoke, the guest of men, by whose mouth, even as a sire's,  
All these Immortals come to gain their food of life, oblations come to
Gods as food.  
9 Thou, Agni, most victorious with thy conquering strength, most Mighty
One, art born for service of the Gods, like wealth for service of the
Gods.  
Most mighty is thine ecstasy, most splendid is thy mental power.  
Therefore men wait upon thee, undecaying One, like vassals, undecaying
One.  
10 To him the mighty, conquering with victorious strength, to Agni
walking with the dawn, who sendeth kine, be sung your laud, to Agni
sung;  
As he who with oblation comes calls him aloud in every place.  
Before the brands of fire he shouteth singerlike, the herald, kindler of
the brands.  
11 Agni, beheld by us in nearest neighbourhood, accordant with the Gods,
bring us, with gracious love, great riches with thy gracious love.  
Give us O Mightiest, what is great, to see and to enjoy the earth.  
As one of awful power, stir up heroic might for those who praise thee,
Bounteous Lord!
