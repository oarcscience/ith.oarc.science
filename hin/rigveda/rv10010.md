### HYMN X.Yama Yami.

1\. FAIN would I win my friend to kindly friendship. So may the Sage,
come through the air's wide ocean,  
Remembering the earth and days to follow, obtain a son, the issue of his
father.  
2 Thy friend loves not the friendship which considers her who is near in
kindred as stranger.  
Sons of the mighty Asura, the Heroes, supporters of the heavens, see far
around them.  
3 Yea, this the Immortals seek of thee with longing, progeny of the sole
existing mortal.  
Then let thy soul and mine be knit together, and as a loving husband
take thy consort.  
4 Shall we do now what we ne’er did aforetime? we who spake righteously
now talk impurely?  
Gandharva in the floods, the Dame of Waters-such is our bond, such our
most lofty kinship.  
5 Even in the womb God Tvaṣṭar, Vivifier, shaping all forms, Creator,
made us consorts.  
None violates his holy ordinances: that we are his the heavens and earth
acknowledge.  
6 Who knows that earliest day whereof thou speakest? Who hatb beheld it?
Who can here declare it?  
Great is the Law of Varuṇa and Mitra. What, wanton! wilt thou say to men
to tempt them?  
7 I, Yami, am possessed by love of Yama, that I may rest on the same
couch beside him.  
I as a wife would yield me to my husband. Like car-wheels let us speed
to meet each other.  
8 They stand not still, they never close their eyelids, those sentinels
of Gods who wander round us.  
Not me-go quickly, wanton, with another, and hasten like a chariot wheel
to meet him.  
9 May Sūrya's eye with days and nights endow him, and ever may his light
spread out before him.  
In heaven and earth the kindred Pair commingle. On Yam! be the
unbrotherly act of Yama.  
10 Sure there will come succeeding times when brothers and sisters will
do acts unmeet for kinsfolk.  
Not me, O fair one,—seek another husband, and make thine arm a pillow
for thy consort.  
11 Is he a brother when no lord is left her? Is she a sister when
Destruction cometh?  
Forced by my love these many words I utter. Come near, and hold me in
thy close embraces.  
12 I will not fold mine arms about thy body: they call it sin when one
comes near his sister.  
Not me,—prepare thy pleasures with another: thy brother seeks not this
from thee, O fair one.  
13 Alas! thou art indeed a weakling, Yama we find in thee no trace of
heart or spirit.  
As round the tree the woodbine clings, another will cling albout thee
girt as with a girdle.  
14 Embrace another, Yami; let another, even as the woodbine rings the
tree, enfold thee.  
Win thou his heart and let him win thy fancy, and he shall form with
thee a blest alliance.
