### HYMN CLXXIX. Rati.

(The following Hymn was originally only found in the Appendix, with
certain lines translated in Latin.—JBH.)

The deified object of this omitted hymn is said to be Rati or Love, and
its Ṛṣis or authors are Lopāmudrā, Agastya, and a disciple. Lopāmudrā is
represented as inviting the caresses of her aged husband Agastya, and
complaining of his coldness and neglect. Agastya responds in stanza 3,
and in the second half of stanza 4 the disciple or the poet briefly
tells the result of the dialogue. Stanza 5 is supposed to be spoken by
the disciple who has overheard the conversation, but its connexion with
the rest of the hymn is not very apparent. In stanza 6 'toiling with
strong endeavour' is a paraphrase and not a translation of the original
*khanamānaḥ khanītraiḥ* (ligonibus fodiens) which Sāyaṇa explains by
'obtaining the desired result by means of lauds and sacrifices.'

M. Bergaigne is of opinion that the hymn has a mystical meaning, Agastya
being identifiable with the celestial Soma whom Lopāmudrā, representing
fervent Prayer, succeeds after long labour in drawing down from his
secret dwelling place. See *La Religion Vedique*, ii. 394 f.

1 'Through many autumns have I toiled and laboured, at night and morn,
through age-inducing dawnings.  
Old age impairs the beauty of our bodies. Let husbands still come near
unto their spouses.  
2 For even the men aforetime, law-fulfillers, who with the Gods declared
eternal statutes,—  
They have decided, but have not accomplished: so now let Wives come near
unto their husbands.  
3 Non inutilis est labor cui Dii favent: nos omnes aemulos et aemulas
vincamus.  
Superemus in hac centum artium pugna in qua duas partes convenientes
utrinque commovemus.  
4 Cupido me cepit illius tauri \[viri\] qui me despicit, utrum hinc
utrum illinc ab aliqua parte nata sit.  
Lopamudra taurum \[maritum suum\] ad se detrahit: insipiens illa
sapientem anhelantem absorbet.  
5 This Soma I address that is most near us, that which hath been imbibed
within the spirit,  
To pardon any sins we have committed. Verily mortal man is full of
longings.  
6 Agastya thus, toiling with strong endeavour, wishing for children,
progeny and power,  
Cherished—a sage of mighty strength—both classes, and with the Gods
obtained his prayer's fulfilment.

By 'both classes' probably priests and princes, or institutors of
sacrifices, are meant. M. Bergaigne understands the expression to mean
the two forms or essences of Soma, the celestial and the terrestrial.
