### HYMN XCVI. Indra.

1 In the great synod will I laud thy two Bay Steeds: I prize the sweet
strong drink of thee the Warrior-God,  
His who pours lovely oil as ’twere with yellow drops. Let my songs enter
thee whose form hath golden tints.  
2 Ye who in concert sing unto the goldhued place, like Bay Steeds
driving onward to the heavenly seat,  
For Indra laud ye strength allied with Tawny Steeds, laud him whom cows
content as ’twere with yellow drops.  
3 His is that thunderbolt, of iron, goldenhued, gold-coloured, very
dear, and yellow in his arms;  
Bright with strong teeth, destroying with its tawny rage. In Indra are
set fast all forms of golden hue.  
4 As if a lovely ray were laid upon the sky, the golden thunderbolt
spread out as in a race.  
That iron bolt with yellow jaw smote Ahi down. A thousand flames had he
who bore the tawny-hued.  
5 Thou, thou, when praised by men who sacrificed of old. hadst pleasure
in their lauds, O Indra golden-haired.  
All that befits thy song of praise thou welcornest, the perfect pleasant
gift, O Golden-hued from birth.  
6 These two dear Bays bring hither Indra on his car, Thunder-armed,
joyous, meet for laud, to drink his fill.  
Many libations flow for him who loveth them: to Indra have the gold-hued
Soma juices run.  
7 Tle gold-hued drops have flowed to gratify his wish: the yellow dro s
have urged the swift Bays to the Strong.  
He who speeds on with Bay Steeds even as he lists hath satisfied his
longing for the golden drops.  
8 At the swift draught the Soma-drinker waxed in might, the Iron One
with yellow beard and yellow hair.  
He, Lord of Tawny Coursers, Lord of fleet-foot Mares, will bear his Bay
Steeds safely over all distress.  
9 His yellow-coloured jaws, like ladles move apart, what time, for
strength, he makes the yellow-tinted stir,  
When, while the bowl stands there, he grooms his Tawny Steeds, when he
hath drunk strong drink, the sweet juice that he loves.  
10 Yea, to the Dear One's seat in homes of heaven and earth the Bay
Steeds' Lord hath whinnied like a horse for food.  
Then the great wish hath seized upon him mightily, and the Beloved One
hath gained high power of life,  
11 Thou, comprehending with thy might the earth and heaven, acceptest
the dear hymn for ever new and new.  
O Asura, disclose thou and make visible the Cow's beloved home to the
bright golden Sun.  
12 O Indra, let the eager wishes of the folk bring thee, delightful,
golden-visored, on thy car,  
That, pleased with sacrifice wherein ten fingers toil, thou mayest, at
the feast, drink of our offered meath.  
13 Juices aforetime, Lord of Bays, thou drankest; and thine especially
is this libation.  
Gladden thee, Indra, with the meath-rich Soma: pour it down ever, Mighty
One! within thee.
