### HYMN XXVI. Brahmaṇaspati.

1\. THE righteous singer shall o’ercome his enemies, and he who serves
the Gods subdue the godless man.  
The zealous man shall vanquish the invincible, the worshipper share the
food of him who worships not.  
2 Worship, thou hero, chase the arrogant afar: put on auspicious courage
for the fight with foes.  
Prepare oblation so that thou mayst have success. we crave the favouring
help of Brahmaṇaspati.  
3 He with his folk, his house, his family, his sons, gains booty for
himself, and, with the heroes, wealth,  
Who with oblation and a true believing heart serves Brahmaṇaspati the
Father of the Gods.  
4 Whoso hath honoured him with offerings rich in oil, him Brahmaṇaspati
leads forward on his way,  
Saves him from sorrow, frees him from his enemy, and is his wonderful
deliverer from woe.
