### HYMN I. Soma Pavamana.

1\. In sweetest and most gladdening stream  
flow pure, O Soma, on thy way,  
Pressed out for Indra, for his drink.  
2 Fiend-queller, Friend of all men, he hath with the wood attained
unto  
His place, his iron-fashioned home.  
3 Be thou best Vṛtra-slayer, best granter of bliss, most liberal:  
Promote our wealthy princes' gifts.  
4 Flow onward with thy juice unto the banquet of the Mighty Gods:  
Flow hither for our strength and fame.  
5 O Indu, we draw nigh to thee, with this one object day by day:  
To thee alone our prayers are said  
6 By means of this eternal fleece may Sūrya's Daughter purify  
Thy Soma that is foaming forth.  
7 Ten sister maids of slender form seize him within the press and hold  
Him firmly on the final day.  
8 The virgins send him forth: they blow the the skin musician-like and
fuse  
The triple foe-repelling meath.  
9 Inviolable milch-kine round about him blend for Indra's drink,  
The fresh young Soma with their milk.  
10 In the wild raptures of this draught, Indra slays all the Vṛtras:
he,  
The Hero, pours his wealth on us.
