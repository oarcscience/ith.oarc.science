### HYMN IX. Agni.

1\. AGNI, show favour: great art thou who to this pious man art come,  
To seat thee on the sacred grass.  
2 May he the Immortal, Helper, bard to be deceived among mankind,  
Become the messenger of all.  
3 Around the altar is he led, welcome Chief Priest at solemn rites,  
Or as the Potar sits him down.  
4 Agni in fire at sacrifice, and in the house as Lord thereof,  
And as a Brahman takes his seat.  
5 Thou comest as the guide of folk who celebrate a sacrifice,  
And to oblations brought by men.  
6 Thou servest as his messenger whose sacrifice thou lovest well,  
To bear the mortal's gifts to heaven.  
7 Accept our solemn rite; be pleased, Aṅgiras, with our sacrifice:  
Give ear and listen to our call.  
8 May thine inviolable car, wherewith thou guardest those who give,  
Come near to us from every side.
