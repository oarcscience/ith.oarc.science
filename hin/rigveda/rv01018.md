### HYMN XVIII. Brahmaṇaspati.

1 O BRĀHMAṆASPATI, make him who presses Soma glorious,  
Even Kakṣīvān Auśija.  
2 The rich, the healer of disease, who giveth wealth, increaseth
store,  
The prompt,—may he be with us still.  
3 Let not the foeman's curse, let not a mortal's onslaught fall on us  
Preserve us, Brahmaṇaspati.  
4 Ne’er is the mortal hero harmed whom Indra, Brahmaṇaspati,  
And Soma graciously inspire.  
5 Do, thou, O Brahmaṇaspati, and Indra, Soma, Dakṣiṇā,  
Preserve that mortal from distress.  
6 To the Assembly's wondrous Lord, to Indra's lovely Friend who gives  
Wisdom, have I drawn near in prayer.  
7 He without whom no sacrifice, e’en of the wise man, prospers; he  
Stirs up the series of thoughts.  
8 He makes the oblation prosper, he promotes the course of sacrifice:  
Our voice of praise goes to the Gods.  
9 I have seen Narāśaṁsa, him most resolute, most widely famed,  
As ’twere the Household Priest of heaven.
