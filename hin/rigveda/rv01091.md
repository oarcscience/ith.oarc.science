### HYMN XCI. Soma.

1\. Thou, Soma, art preeminent for wisdom; along the straightest path
thou art our leader.  
Our wise forefathers by thy guidance, Indu, dealt out among the Gods
their share of treasure.  
2 Thou by thine insight art most wise, O Soma, strong by thine energies
and all possessing,  
Mighty art thou by all thy powers and greatness, by glories art thou
glorious, guide of mortals.  
3 Thine are King Varuṇa's eternal statutes, lofty and deep, O Soma, is
thy glory.  
All-pure art thou like Mitra the beloved, adorable, like Aryaman, O
Soma.  
4 With all thy glories on the earth, in heaven, on mountains, in the
plants, and in the waters,—  
With all of these, well-pleased and not in anger, accept, O royal Soma,
our oblations.  
5 Thou, Soma, art the Lord of heroes, King, yea, Vṛtra-slayer thou:  
Thou art auspicious energy.  
6 And, Soma, let it be thy wish that we may live and may not die:  
Praise-loving Lord of plants art thou.  
7 To him who keeps the law, both old and young, thou givest happiness,  
And energy that he may live.  
8 Guard us, King Soma, on all sides from him who threatens us: never
let  
The friend of one like thee be harmed.  
9 With those delightful aids which thou hast, Soma, for the
worshipper,—  
Even with those protect thou us.  
10 Accepting this our sacrifice and this our praise, O Soma, come,  
And be thou nigh to prosper us.  
11 Well-skilled in speech we magnify thee, Soma, with our sacred
songs:  
Come thou to us, most gracious One.  
12 Enricher, healer of disease, wealth-finder, prospering our store,  
Be, Soma, a good Friend to us.  
13 Soma, be happy in our heart, as milch-kine in the grassy meads,  
As a young man in his own house.  
14 O Soma, God, the mortal man who in thy friendship hath delight,  
Him doth the mighty Sage befriend.  
15 Save us from slanderous reproach, keep us., O Soma, from distress:  
Be unto us a gracious Friend.  
16 Soma, wax great. From every side may vigorous powers unite in thee:  
Be in the gathering-place of strength.  
17 Wax, O most gladdening Soma, great through all thy rays of light, and
be  
A Friend of most illustrious fame to prosper us.  
16 In thee be juicy nutriments united, and powers and mighty
foe-subduing vigour,  
Waxing to immortality, O Soma: win highest glories for thyself in
heaven.  
19 Such of thy glories as with poured oblations men honour, may they all
invest our worship.  
Wealth-giver, furtherer with troops of heroes, sparing the brave, come,
Soma, to our houses.  
20 To him who worships Soma gives the milch-cow, a fleet steed and a man
of active knowledge,  
Skilled in home duties, meet for holy synod, for council meet, a glory
to his father.  
21 Invincible in fight, saver in battles, guard of our camp, winner of
light and water,  
Born amid hymns, well-housed, exceeding famous, victor, in thee will we
rejoice, O Soma.  
22 These herbs, these milch-kine, and these running waters, all these, O
Soma, thou hast generated.  
The spacious firmament hast thou expanded, and with the light thou hast
dispelled the darkness.  
23 Do thou, God Soma, with thy Godlike spirit, victorious, win for us a
share of riches.  
Let none prevent thee: thou art Lord of valour. Provide for both sides
in the fray for booty.
