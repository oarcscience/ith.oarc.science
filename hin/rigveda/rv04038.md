### HYMN XXXVIII. Dadhikris.

1\. FROM you two came the gifts in days aforetime which Trasadasyu
granted to the Pūrus.  
Ye gave the winner of our fields and plough-lands, and the strong smiter
who subdued the Dasyus.  
2 And ye gave mighty Dadhikrās, the giver of many gifts, who visiteth
all people,  
Impetuous hawk, swift and of varied colour, like a brave King whom each
true man must honour.  
3 Whom, as ’twere down a precipice, swift rushing, each Pūru praises and
his heart rejoices,—  
Springing forth like a hero fain for battle, whirling the car and flying
like the tempest.  
4 Who gaineth precious booty in the combats and moveth, winning spoil,
among the cattle;  
Shown in bright colour, looking on the assemblies, beyond the churl, to
worship of the living.  
5 Loudly the folk cry after him in battles, as ’twere a thief who steals
away a garment;  
Speeding to glory, or a herd of cattle, even as a hungry falcon swooping
downward.  
6 And, fain to come forth first amid these armies, this way and that
with rows of cars he rushes,  
Gay like a bridesman, making him a garland, tossing the dust, champing
the rein that holds him.  
7 And that strong Steed, victorious and faithful, obedient with his body
in the combat,  
Speeding straight on amid the swiftly pressing, casts o’er his brows the
dust he tosses upward.  
8 And at his thunder, like the roar of heaven, those who attack tremble
and are affrighted;  
For when he fights against embattled thousands, dread is he in his
striving; none may stay him.  
9 The people praise the overpowering swiftness of this fleet Steed who
giveth men abundance.  
Of him they say when drawing back from battle. Dadhikrās hath sped
forward with his thousands.  
10 Dadhikrās hath o’erspread the Fivefold People with vigour, as the Sun
lightens the waters.  
May the strong Steed who winneth hundreds, thousands, requite with
sweetness these my words and praises.
