### HYMN L. Viśvedevas.

1\. I CALL with prayers on Aditi your Goddess, on Agni, Mitra, Varuṇa
for favour,  
On Aryaman who gives unasked, the gracious, on Gods who save, on Savitar
and Bhaga.  
2 Visit, to prove us free from sin, O Sūrya Lord of great might, the
bright Gods sprung from Dakṣa,  
Twice-born and true, observing sacred duties, Holy and full of light,
whose tongue is Agni.  
3 And, O ye Heaven and Earth, a wide dominion, O ye most blissful
Worlds, our lofty shelter,  
Give ample room and freedom for our dwelling, a home, ye Hemispheres,
which none may rival.  
4 This day invited may the Sons of Rudra, resistless, excellent, stoop
down to meet us;  
For, when beset with slight or sore affliction, we ever call upon the
Gods, the Maruts;  
5 To whom the Goddess Rodasī clings closely, whom Pūṣan follows bringing
ample bounty.  
What time ye hear our call and come, O Maruts, upon your separate path
all creatures tremble.  
6 With a new hymn extol, O thou who singest, the Lover of the Song, the
Hero Indra.  
May he, exalted, hear our invocation, and grant us mighty wealth and
strength when lauded.  
7 Give full protection, Friends of man, ye Waters, in peace and trouble,
to our sons and grandsons.  
For ye are our most motherly physicians, parents of all that standeth,
all that moveth.  
8 May Savitar come hither and approach us, the God who rescues, Holy,
goldenhanded,  
The God who, bounteous as the face of Morning, discloses precious gifts
for him who worships.  
9 And thou, O Son of Strength, do thou turn hither the Gods to-day to
this our holy service.  
May I for evermore enjoy thy bounty and, Agni, by thy grace be rich in
heroes.  
10 Come also to my call, O ye Nāsatyas, yea, verily, through my prayers,
ye Holy Sages.  
As from great darkness ye delivered Atri, protect us, Chiefs, from
danger in the conflict.  
11 O Gods, bestow upon us riches, splendid with strength and heroes,
bringing food in plenty.  
Be gracious, helpful Gods of earth, of heaven, born of the Cow, and
dwellers in the waters.  
12 May Rudra and Sarasvatī, accordant, Viṣṇu and Vāyu, pour down gifts
and bless us;  
Ṛbhukṣan, Vāja, and divine Vidhatar, Parjanya, Vāta make our food
abundant.  
13 May this God Savitar, the Lord, the Offspring of Waters, pouring down
his dew be gracious,  
And, with the Gods and Dames accordant, Tvaṣṭar; Dyaus with the Gods and
Prthivi with oceans.  
14 May Aja-Ekapād and Ahibudhnya, and Earth and Ocean hear our
invocation;  
All Gods who strengthen Law, invoked and lauded, and holy texts uttered
by sages, help us.  
15 So with my thoughts and hymns of praise the children of Bharadvāja
sing aloud to please you.  
The Dames invoked, and the resistless Vasus, and all ye Holy Ones have
been exalted.
