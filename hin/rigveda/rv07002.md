### HYMN II. Āprīs.

1\. GLADLY accept, this day, our fuel, Agni: send up thy sacred smoke
and shine sublimely.  
Touch the celestial summits with thy columns, and overspread thee with
the rays of Sūrya.  
2 With sacrifice to these we men will honour the majesty of holy
Narāśaṁsa-  
To these the pure, most wise, the thought. inspirers, Gods who enjoy
both sorts of our oblations.  
3 We will extol at sacrifice for ever, as men may do, Agni whom Manu
kindled,  
Your very skilful Asura, meet for worship, envoy between both worlds,
the truthful speaker.  
4 Bearing the sacred grass, the men who serve him strew it with
reverence, on their knees, by Agni.  
Calling him to the spotted grass, oil-sprinkled, adorn him, ye
Adhvaryus, with oblation.  
5 With holy thoughts the pious have thrown open Doors fain for chariots
in the Gods’ assembly.  
Like two full mother cows who lick their youngling, like maidens for the
gathering, they adorn them.  
6 And let the two exalted Heavenly Ladies, Morning and Night, like a cow
good at milking,  
Come, much-invoked, and on our grass be seated ' wealthy, deserving
worship, for our welfare.  
7 You, Bards and Singers at men's sacrifices, both filled with wisdom, I
incline to worship.  
Send up our offerings when we call upon you, and so among the Gods
obtain us treasures.  
8 May Bhāratī with all her Sisters, Iḷā accordant with the Gods, with
mortals Agni,  
Sarasvatī with all her kindred Rivers, come to this grass, Three
Goddesses, and seat them.  
9 Well pleased with us do thou, O God, O Tvaṣṭar, give ready issue to
our procreant vigour,  
Whence springs the hero, powerful, skilled in action, lover of Gods,
adjuster of the press-stones.  
10 Send to the Gods the oblation, Lord of Forests, and let the
Immolator, Agni, dress it.  
He as the truer Priest shall offer worship, for the God'sgenerations
well he knoweth.  
11 Come thou to us, O Agni, duly kindled, together with the potent Gods
and Indra.  
On this our grass sit Aditi, happy Mother, and let our Hail! delight the
Gods Immortal.
