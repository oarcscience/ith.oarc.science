### HYMN LII. Indra.

1 I GLORIFY that Ram who finds the light of heaven, whose hundred
nobly-natured ones go forth with him.  
With hymns may I turn hither Indra to mine aid,—the Car which like a
strong steed hasteth to the call.  
2 Like as a mountain on firm basis, unremoved, he, thousandfold
protector, waxed in mighty strength,  
When Indra, joying in the draughts of Soma juice, forced the clouds,
slaying Vṛtra stayer of their flow.  
3 For he stays e’en the stayers, spread o’er laden cloud, rooted in
light, strengthened in rapture by the wise.  
Indra with thought, with skilled activity, I call, most liberal giver,
for he sates him with the juice.  
4 Whom those that flow in heaven on sacred grass, his own assistants,
nobly-natured, fill full like the sea,—  
Beside that Indra when he smote down Vṛtra stood his helpers, straight
in form, mighty, invincible.  
5 To him, as in wild joy he fought with him who stayed the rain, his
helpers sped like swift streams down a slope,  
When Indra, thunder-armed, made bold by Soma draughts, as Tṛta cleaveth
Vala's fences, cleft him through.  
6 Splendour encompassed thee, forth shone thy warrior might: the
rain-obstructer lay in mid-air's lowest deep,  
What time, O Indra, thou didst cast thy thunder down upon the jaws of
Vṛitra hard to be restrained.  
7 The hymns which magnify thee, Indra, reach to thee even as
water-brooks flow down and fill the lake.  
Tvaṣṭar gave yet more force to thine appropriate strength, and forged
thy thunderbolt of overpowering might.  
8 When, Indra, thou whose power is linked with thy Bay Steeds hadst
smitten Vṛtra, causing floods to flow for man,  
Thou heldst in thine arms the metal thunderbolt, and settest in the
heaven the Sun for all to see.  
9 In fear they raised the lofty self-resplendent hymn, praise giving and
effectual, leading up to heaven,  
When Indra's helpers fighting for the good of men, the Maruts, faithful
to mankind, joyed in the light.  
10 Then Heaven himself, the mighty, at that Dragon's roar reeled back in
terror when, Indra, thy thunderbolt  
In the wild joy of Soma had struck off with might the head of Vṛtra,
tyrant of the earth and heaven.  
11 O Indra, were this earth extended forth tenfold, and men who dwell
therein multiplied day by day,  
Still here thy conquering might, Maghavan, would be famed: it hath waxed
vast as heaven in majesty and power.  
12 Thou, bold of heart, in thine own native might, for help, upon the
limit of this mid-air and of heaven,  
Hast made the earth to be the pattern of thy strength: embracing flood
and light thou reachest to the sky.  
13 Thou art the counterpart of earth, the Master of lofty heaven with
all its mighty Heroes:  
Thou hast filled all the region with thy greatness: yea, of a truth
there is none other like thee.  
14 Whose amplitude the heaven and earth have not attained, whose bounds
the waters of mid-air have never reached,—  
Not, when in joy he fights the stayer of the rain: thou, and none else,
hast made all things in order due.  
15 The Maruts sang thy praise in this encounter, and in thee all the
Deities delighted,  
What time thou, Indra, with thy spiky weapon, thy deadly bolt, smotest
the face of Vṛtra.
