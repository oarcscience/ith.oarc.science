### HYMN XL Soma Pavamana.

1\. SING forth to Indu, O ye men, to him who is purified,  
Fain to pay worship to the Gods.  
2 Together with thy pleasant juice the Atharvans have commingled milk,  
Divine, devoted to the God.  
3 Bring, by thy flowing, weal to kine, weal to the people, weal to
steeds.  
Weal, O thou King, to growing plants  
4 Sing a praise-song to Soma brown of hue, of independent might.  
The Red, who reaches up to heaven.  
5 Purify Soma when effused with stones which bands move rapidly,  
And pour the sweet milk in the meath.  
6 With humble homage draw ye nigh; blend the libation with the curds:  
To Indra offer Indu up.  
7 Soma, foe-que chief o’er men, doing the will of pour forth  
Prosperity upon our kine.  
8 Heart-knower, Sovran of the heart, thou art effused, O Soma, that
Indra may drink thee and rejoice.  
9 O Soma Pavamana, give us riches and heroic strength,—  
Indu! with. Indra for ally.
