### HYMN XXXIX. Indra.

1\. STONE-DARTING Indra. Wondrous One, what wealth is richly given from
thee,  
That bounty, Treasure-Finder! bring filling both thy hands, to us.  
2 Bring what thou deemest worth the wish, O Indra, that which is in
heaven.  
So may we know thee as thou art, boundless in thy munificence.  
3 Thy lofty spirit, far-renowned as fain to give and prompt to win,—  
With this thou rendest e’en the firm, Stone-Darter! so to gain thee
strength.  
4 Singers with many songs have made Indra propitious to their fame,  
Him who is King of human kind, most liberal of your wealthy ones.  
5 To him, to Indra must be sung the poet's word, the hymn of praise.  
To him, accepter of the prayer, the Atris raise their songs on high, the
Atris beautify their songs.
