### HYMN LXX. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THE three times seven Milch-kine in the eastern heaven have for this
Soma poured the genuine milky draught.  
Four other beauteous Creatures hath he made for his adornment, when he
waxed in strength through holy rites.  
2 Longing for lovely Amṛta, by his wisdom he divided, each apart from
other, earth and heaven.  
He gladly wrapped himself in the most lucid floods, when through their
glory they found the God's resting-place.  
3 May those his brilliant rays he ever free from death, inviolate, for
both classes of created things,—  
Rays wherewith powers of men and Gods are purified. Yea, even for this
have sageswelcomed him as King.  
4 He, while he is adorned by the ten skilful ones, that he too in the
Midmost Mothers may create,  
While he is watching o’er the lovely Amṛta's ways, looks on both races
as Beholder of mankind.  
5 He, while he is adorned to stream forth mighty strength, rejoices in
his place between the earth and heaven.  
The Steer dispels the evil-hearted with his might, aiming at offerings
as an archer at the game.  
6 Beholding, as it were, Two Mother Cows, the Steer goes roaring on his
way even as the Maruts roar.  
Knowing Eternal Law, the earliest light of heaven, he, passing wise, was
chosen out to tell it forth.  
7 The fearful Bull is bellowing with violent might, far-sighted,
sharpening his yellowcoloured horns.  
Soma assumes his seat in the well-fashioned place: the cowhide and the
sheepskin are his ornament.  
8 Bright, making pure his body free from spot and stain, on the sheep's
back the Golden-coloured hath flowed down.  
Acceptable to Mitra, Vāyu, Varuṇa, he is prepared as threefold meal by
skilful men.  
9 Flow on for the God's banquet, Soma, as a Steer, and enter Indra's
heart, the Soma's reservoir.  
Bear us beyond misfortune ere we be oppres. sed. the man who knows the
land directs the man who asks.  
10 Urged like a car-steed flow to strength, O Soma: Indu, flow onward to
the throat of Indra.  
Skilled, bear us past, as in a boat o’er water: as battling Hero save us
from the foeman.
