### HYMN VIII Praskaṇva's Go.

1\. THY bounty, Dasyave-vrka, exhaustless hath displayed itself:  
Its fulness is as broad as heaven.  
2 Ten thousand Dasyave-vrka, the son of Putakrata, hath  
From his own wealth bestowed on me.  
3 A hundred asses hath he given, a hundred head of fleecy sheep,  
A hundred slaves, and wreaths besides.  
4 There also was a mare led forth, picked out for Putakrata's sake,  
Not of the horses of the herd.  
5 Observant Agni hath appeared, oblation-bearer with his car.  
Agni with his resplendent flame hath shone on high as shines the Sun,
hath shone like Sūrya in theheavens.
