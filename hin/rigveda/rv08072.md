### HYMN LXXII. Viśvedevas.

1\. WE choose unto ourselves that high protection of the Mighty Gods  
That it may help and succour us.  
2 May they be ever our allies, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,  
Far-seeing Gods who prosper us.  
3 Ye furtherers of holy Law, transport us safe o’er many woes,  
As over water-floods in ships.  
4 Dear wealth be Aryaman to us, Varuṇa dear wealth meet for praise:  
Dear wealth we choose unto ourselves.  
5 For Sovrans of dear wealth are ye, Ādityas, not of sinner's wealth,  
Ye sapient Gods who slay the foe.  
6 We in our homes, ye Bounteous Ones, and while we journey on the
road,  
Invoke you, Gods, to prosper us.  
7 Regard us, Indra, Viṣṇu, here, ye Aśvins and the Marut host,  
Us who are kith and kin to you.  
8 Ye Bounteous Ones, from time of old we here set forth our
brotherhood,  
Our kinship in. the Mother's womb.  
9 Then come with Indra for your chief, as early day, ye Bounteous Gods  
Yea, 1 address you now for this.
