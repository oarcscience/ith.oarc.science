### HYMN CXXV. Svanaya.

1\. COMING at early morn he gives his treasure; the prudent one receives
and entertains him.  
Thereby increasing still his life and offspring, he comes with brave
sons to abundant riches.  
2 Rich shall he be in gold and kine and horses. Indra bestows on him
great vital power,  
Who stays thee, as thou comest, with his treasure, like game caught in
the net, O early comer.  
3 Longing, I came this morning to the pious, the son of sacrifice, with
car wealth-laden.  
Give him to drink juice of the stalk that gladdens; prosper with
pleasant hymns the Lord of Heroes.  
4 Health-bringing streams, as milch-cows, flow to profit him who hath
worshipped, him who now will worship.  
To him who freely gives and fills on all sides full streams of fatness
flow and make him famous.  
5 On the high ridge of heaven he stands exalted, yea, to the Gods he
goes, the liberal giver.  
The streams, the waters flow for him with fatness: to him this guerdon
ever yields abundance.  
6 For those who give rich meeds are all these splendours, for those who
give rich meeds suns shine in heaven.  
The givers of rich meeds are made immortal; the givers of rich fees
prolong their lifetime.  
7 Let not the liberal sink to sin and sorrow, never decay the pious
chiefs who worship!  
Let every man besides be their protection, and let affliction fall upon
the niggard.
