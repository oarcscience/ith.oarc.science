### HYMN LXXI. Agni.

1\. LOVING the loving One, as wives their husband, the sisters of one
home have urged him forward,  
Bright-coloured, even, as the cows love morning, dark, breaking forth to
view, and redly beaming.  
2 Our sires with lauds burst e’en the firm-set fortress, yea, the
Aṅgirases, with roar, the mountain.  
They made for us a way to reach high heaven, they found us day, light,
day's sign, beams of morning.  
3 They stablished order, made his service fruitful; then parting them
among the longing faithful,  
Not thirsting after aught, they come, most active, while with sweet food
the race of Gods they strengthen.  
4 Since Mātariśvan, far-diffused, hath stirred him, and he in every
house grown bright and noble,  
He, Bhṛgu-like I hath gone as his companion, as on commission to a
greater Sovran.  
5 When man poured juice to Heaven, the mighty Father, he knew and freed
himself from close embracement.  
The archer boldly shot at him his arrow, and the God threw his splendour
on his Daughter.  
6 Whoso, hath flames for thee within his dwelling, or brings the worship
which thou lovest daily,  
Do thou of double might increase his substance: may he whom thou
incitest meet with riches.  
7 All sacrificial viands wait on Agni as the Seven mighty Rivers seek
the ocean.  
Not by our brethren was our food discovered: find with the Gods care for
us, thou who knowest.  
8 When light hath filled the Lord of men for increase, straight from the
heaven descends the limpid moisture.  
Agni hath brought to light and filled with spirit the youthful host
blameless and well providing.  
9 He who like thought goes swiftly on his journey, the Sun, alone is
ever Lord of riches.  
The Kings with fair hands, Varuṇa and Mitra, protect the precious nectar
in our cattle.  
10 O Agni, break not our ancestral friendship, Sage as thou art, endowed
with deepest knowledge.  
Old age, like gathering cloud, impairs the body: before that evil be
come nigh protect me.
