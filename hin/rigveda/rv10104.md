### HYMN CIV. Indra.

1\. Soma hath flowed for thee, Invoked of mat Speed to our sacrifice
with both thy Coursers.  
To thee have streameld the songs or mighty singers, imploring, Indra,
drink of our libation.  
2 Drink of the juice which men have washed in waters, and fill thee
full, O Lord of Tawny Horses.  
O Indra, hearer of the laud, with Soma which stones have mixed for thee
enhance thy rapture.  
3 To make thee start, a strong true draught I offer to thee, the Bull, O
thou whom Bay Steeds carry.  
Here take delight, O Indra, in our voices while thou art hymned with
power and all our spirit.  
4 O Mighty Indra, through thine aid, thy prowess, obtaining life,
zealous, and skilled in Order,  
Men in the house who share the sacred banquet stand singing praise that
brings them store of children.  
5 Through thy directions, Lord of Tawny Coursers, thine who art firm,
splendid, and blest, the people  
Obtain most liberal aid for their salvation, and praise thee, Indra,
through thine excellencies.  
6 Lord of the Bays, come with thy two Bay Horses, come to our prayers,
to drink the juice of Soma.  
To thee comes sacrifice which thou acceptest: thou, skilled in holy
rites, art he who giveth.  
7 Him of a thousand powers, subduing foemen, Maghavan praised with hymns
and pleased with Soma,—  
Even him our songs approach, resistless Indra: the adorations of the
singer laud him.  
8 The way to bliss for Gods and man thou foundest, Indra, seven lovely
floods, divine, untroubled,  
Wherewith thou, rending forts, didst move the ocean, and nine-and-ninety
flowing streams of water.  
9 Thou from the curse didst free the mighty Waters, and as their only
God didst watch and guard them.  
O Indra, cherish evermore thy body with those which thou hast won in
quelling Vṛtra.  
10 Heroic power and noble praise is Indra yea, the song worships him
invoked of many.  
Vṛtra he quelled, and gave men room and freedom: gakra, victorious, hath
conquered armies.  
11 Call we on Maghayan, auspicious Indra. best Hero in this fight where
spoil is gathered,  
The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras,
wins and gathers riches.
