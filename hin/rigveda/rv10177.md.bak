### HYMN CLXXVII. Māyābheda.

1\. THE sapient with their spirit and their mind behold the Bird adorned
with all an Asura's magic might.  
Sages observe him in the ocean's inmost depth: the wise disposers seek
the station of his rays.  
2 The flying Bird bears Speech within his spirit: erst the Gandharva in
the womb pronounced it:  
And at the seat of sacrifice the sages cherish this radiant,
heavenly-bright invention.  
3 I saw the Herdsman, him who never resteth, approaching and departing
on his pathways.  
He, clothed in gathered and diffusive splendour, within the worlds
continually travels.
