### HYMN XXXII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THE rapture-shedding Soma-drops, effused in our assembly, have  
Flowed forth to glorify our prince.  
2 Then Trita's Maidens onward urge the Tawny-coloured with the stones,  
Indu for Indra, for his drink.  
3 Now like a swan he maketh all the company sing each his hymn:  
He, like a steed, is bathed in milk.  
4 O Soma, viewing heaven and earth, thou runncst like a darting deer  
Set in the place of sacrifice.  
5 The cows have sung with joy to him, even as a woman to her love  
He came as to a settled race.  
6 Bestow illustrious fame on us, both on our liberal lords and me,  
Glory, intelligence, and wealth.
