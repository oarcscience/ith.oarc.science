### HYMN IX. Indra.

1 COME, Indra, and delight thee with the juice at all the Soma feasts,  
Protector, mighty in thy strength.  
2 To Indra pour ye forth the juice, the active gladdening juice to him  
The gladdening, omnific God.  
3 O Lord of all men, fair of cheek, rejoice thee in the gladdening
lauds,  
Present at these drink-offerings.  
4 Songs have outpoured themselves to thee, Indra, the strong, the
guardian Lord,  
And raised themselves unsatisfied.  
5 Send to us bounty manifold, O Indra, worthy of our wish,  
For power supreme is only thine.  
6 O Indra, stimulate thereto us emulously fain for wealth,  
And glorious, O most splendid One.  
7 Give, Indra, wide and lofty fame, wealthy in cattle and in strength,  
Lasting our life-time, failing not.  
8 Grant us high fame, O Indra, grant riches bestowing thousands, those  
Fair fruits of earth borne home in wains.  
9 Praising with songs the praise-worthy who cometh to our aid, we call  
Indra, the Treasure-Lord of wealth.  
10 To lofty Indra, dweller by each libation, the pious man  
Sings forth aloud a strengthening hymn.
