### HYMN XXI. Indra.

1\. WE call on thee, O Matchless One! We seeking help, possessing
nothing firm ourselves,  
Call on thee wonderful in fight  
2 On thee for aid in sacrifice. This youth of ours, the bold, the
mighty, hath gonse forth.  
We therefore, we thy friends, Indra, havie chosen thee, free-giver, as
our Guardian God.  
3 Come hither, for the drops are here, O Lord of corn-lands. Lord of
horses, Lord of kine:  
Drink thou the Soma, Soma's Lord!  
4 For we the kinless singers have drawn hither thee, O Indra, who hast
numerous kin.  
With all the forms thou hast, comic thou of bull-like strength, come
near to drink the Soma juice.  
5 Sitting like birds beside thy meath., mingled with milk, that
gladdeneth and exalteth thee,  
Indra, to thee we sing aloud.  
6 We speak to thee with this our reverential prayer. Why art thou
pondering yet awhile?  
Here are our wishes; thou art liberal, Lord of Bays: we and our hymns
are present here.  
7 For not in recent times alone, O Indra, Thunder-armed, have we
obtained thine aid.  
Of old we knew thy plenteous wealth.  
8 Hero, we knew thy friendship and thy rich rewards: these, Thunderer,
now we crave of thee.  
O Vasu, for all wealth that cometh of the kine, sharpen our powers,
fair-visored God.  
9 Him who of old hath brought to us this and that blessing, him I
magnify for you,  
Even Indra, O my friends, for help  
10 Borne by Bay Steeds, the Lord of heroes, ruling men, for it is he who
takes; delight.  
May Maghavan bestow on us his worshippers hundreds of cattle and of
steeds.  
11 Hero, may we, with thee for Friend, withstand the man who pants
against us in his wrath,  
In fight with people rich in kine.  
12 May we be victors in the singer's battlesong, and meet the wicked,
Much invoked!  
With heroes smite the foeman and show forth our strength. O Indra,
further thou our thoughts.  
13 O Indra, from all ancient time rivalless ever and companionless art
thou:  
Thou seekest comradeship in war.  
14 Thou findest not the wealthy man to be thy friend: those scorn thee
who are flown with wine.  
What time thou thunderest and gatherest, then thou, even as a Father,
art invoked.  
15 O Indra, let us not, like fools who waste their lives at home, with
friendship such as thine  
Sit idly by the poured-out juice.  
16 Giver of kine, may we not miss thy gracious gifts: let us not rob
thee of thine own.  
Strip even the strong places of the foe, and bring: thy gifts can never
be made vain.  
17 Indra or blest Sarasvatī alone bestows such wealth, treasure so
great, or thou,  
O Citra, on the worshipper.  
18 Citra is King, and only kinglings are the rest who dwell beside
Sarasvatī.  
He, like Parjanya with his rain, hath spread himself with thousand, yea,
with myriad gifts.
