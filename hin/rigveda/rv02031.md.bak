### HYMN XXXI. Viśvedevas.

1\. HELP, Varuṇa and Mitra, O ye Twain allied with Vasus, Rudras, and
Ādityas, help our car,  
That, as the wild birds of the forest from their home, our horses may
fly forth, glad, eager for renown.  
2 Yea, now ye Gods of one accord speed on our car what time among the
folk it seeks an act of might;  
When, hasting through the region with the stamp of hoofs, our swift
steeds trample on the ridges of the earth.  
3 Or may our Indra here, the Friend of all mankind, coming from heaven,
most wise, girt by the Marut host,  
Accompany, with aid untroubled by a foe, our car to mighty gain, to win
the meed of strength.  
4 Or may this Tvaṣṭar, God who rules the world with power, one-minded
with the Goddesses speed forth our car;  
Iḷā and Bhaga the celestial, Earth and Heaven, Pūṣan, Purandhi, and the
Aśvins, ruling Lords.  
5 Or, seen alternate, those two blessed Goddesses, Morning and Night who
stir all living things to act:  
While with my newest song I praise you both, O Earth, that from what
moves not ye may spread forth threefold food.  
6 Your blessing as a boon for suppliants we desire: the Dragon of the
Deep, and Aja-Ekapād,  
Trita, Ṛbhukṣan, Savitar shall joy in us, and the Floods’ swift Child in
our worship and our prayer.  
7 These earnest prayers I pray to you, ye Holy: to pay you honour,
living men have formed them,  
Men fain to win the prize and glory. May they win, as a car-horse might
the goal, your notice.
