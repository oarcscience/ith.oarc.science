### HYMN LXXXIII. Indra-Varuṇa.

1\. LOOKING to you and your alliance, O ye Men, armed with broad axes
they went forward, fain for spoil.  
Ye smote and slew his Dāsa and his Āryan enemies, and helped Sudās with
favour, Indra-Varuṇa.  
2 Where heroes come together with their banners raised, in the encounter
where is naught for us to love,  
Where all things that behold the light are terrified, there did ye
comfort us, O Indra-Varuṇa.  
3 The boundaries of earth were seen all dark with dust: O Indra-Varuṇa,
the shout went up to heaven.  
The enmities of the people compassed me about. Ye heard my calling and
ye came to me with help.  
4 With your resistless weapons, Indra-Varuṇa, ye conquered Bheda and ye
gave Sudās your aid.  
Ye heard the prayers of these amid the cries of war: effectual was the
service of the Trtsus' priest.  
5 O Indra-Varuṇa, the wickedness of foes and mine assailants' hatred
sorely trouble me.  
Ye Twain are Lords of riches both of earth and heaven: so grant to us
your aid on the decisive day.  
6 The men of both the hosts invoked you in the fight, Indra and Varuṇa,
that they might win the wealth,  
What time ye helped Sudās, with all the Trtsu folk, when the Ten Kings
had pressed him down in their attack.  
7 Ten Kings who worshipped not, O Indra-Varuṇa, confederate, in war
prevailed not o’er Sudās.  
True was the boast of heroes sitting at the feast: so at their
invocations Gods were on their side.  
8 O Indra-Varuṇa, ye gave Sudās your aid when the Ten Kings in battle
compassed him about,  
There where the white-robed Trtsus with their braided hair, skilled in
song worshipped you with homage and with hymn.  
9 One of you Twain destroys the Vṛtras in the fight, the Other evermore
maintains his holy Laws.  
We call on you, ye Mighty, with our hymns of praise. Vouchsafe us your
protection, Indra-Varuṇa.  
10 May Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman vouchsafe us glory and great
shelter spreading far.  
We think of the beneficent light of Aditi, and Savitar's song of praise,
the God who strengthens Law.
