### HYMN XIV. Indra.

1\. MINISTERS, bring the Soma juice for Indra, pour forth the gladdening
liquor with the beakers.  
To drink of this the Hero longeth ever; offer it to the Bull, for this
he willeth.  
2 Ye ministers, to him who with the lightning smote, like a tree, the
rain-withholding Vṛtra—  
Bring it to him, him who is fain to taste it, a draught of this which
Indra here deserveth.  
3 Ye ministers, to him who smote Dṛbhīka, who drove the kine forth, and
discovered Vala,  
Offer this draught, like Vita in the region: clothe him with Soma even
as steeds with trappings.  
4 Him who did Uraṇa to death, Adhvaryus! though showing arms
ninety-and-nine in number;  
Who cast down headlong Arbuda and slew him,—speed ye that Indra to our
offered Soma.  
5 Ye ministers, to him who struck down Svaśna, and did to death Vyaṁsa
and greedy Śuṣṇa,  
And Rudhikrās and Namuci and Pipru,—to him, to Indra, pour ye forth
libation.  
6 Ye ministers, to him who as with thunder demolished Śambara's hundred
ancient castles;  
Who cast down Varcin's sons, a hundred thousand,—to him, to Indra, offer
ye the Soma.  
7 Ye ministers, to him who slew a hundred thousand, and cast them down
upon earth's bosom;  
Who quelled the valiant men of Atithigva, Kutsa, and Āyu,—bring to him
the Soma.  
8 Ministers, men, whatever thing ye long for obtain ye quickly bringing
gifts to Indra.  
Bring to the Glorious One what bands have cleansed; to Indra bring, ye
pious ones, the Soma.  
9 Do ye, O ministers, obey his order: that purified in wood, in wood
uplift ye.  
Well pleased he longs for what your hands have tended: offer the
gladdening Soma juice to Indra.  
10 As the cow's udder teems with milk, Adhvaryus, so fill with Soma
Indra, liberal giver.  
I know him: I am sure of this, the Holy knows that I fain would give to
him more largely.  
11 Him, ministers, the Lord of heavenly treasure and all terrestrial
wealth that earth possesses,  
Him, Indra, fill with Soma as a garner is filled with barley full: be
this your labour.  
12 Prepare thyself to grant us that great booty, O Vasu, for abundant is
thy treasure.  
Gather up wondrous wealth, O Indra, daily. Loud may we speak, with
heroes, in assembly.
