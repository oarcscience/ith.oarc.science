### HYMN LXXIV. Indra.

1\. I AM prepared to laud with song or worship the Noble Ones who are in
earth and heaven,  
Or Coursers who have triumphed in, the contest, or those who famed, have
won the prize with glory.  
2 Their call, the call of Gods, went up to heaven: they kissed the
ground with glory-seeking spirit,  
There where the Gods look on for happy fortune, and like the kindly
heavens bestow their bounties.  
3 This is the song of those Immortal Beings who long for treasures in
their full perfection.  
May these, completing prayers and sacrifices, bestow upon us wealth
where naught is wanting.  
4 Those living men extolled thy deed, O Indra, those who would fain
burst through the stall of cattle,  
Fain to milk her who bare but once, great, lofty, whose Sons are many
and her streams past number.  
5 Sacivan, win to your assistance Indra who never bends, who overcomes
his foemen.  
Ṛbhukṣan, Maghavan, the hymn's upholder, who, rich in food, bears man's
kind friend, the thunder.  
6 Since he who won of old anew hath triumphed, Indra hath earned his
name of Vṛtra-slaycr.  
He hath appeared, the mighty Lord of Conquest. What we would have him do
let him accomplish.
