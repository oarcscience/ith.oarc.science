### HYMN CXV. Sūrya.

1\. THE brilliant presence of the Gods hath risen, the eye of Mitra,
Varuṇa and Agni.  
The soul of all that moveth not or moveth, the Sun hath filled the air
and earth and heaven.  
2 Like as a young man followeth a maiden, so doth the Sun the Dawn,
refulgent Goddess:  
Where pious men extend their generations, before the Auspicious One for
happy fortune.  
3 Auspicious are the Sun's Bay-coloured Horses, bright, changing hues,
meet for our shouts of triumph.  
Bearing our prayers, the sky's ridge have they mounted, and in a moment
speed round earth and heaven.  
4 This is the Godhead, this might of Sūrya: he hath withdrawn what
spread o’er work unfinished.  
When he hath loosed his Horses from their station, straight over all
Night spreadeth out her garment.  
5 In the sky's lap the Sun this form assumeth that Varuṇa and Mitra may
behold it.  
His Bay Steeds well maintain his power eternal, at one time bright and
darksome at another.  
6 This day, O Gods, while Sūrya is ascending, deliver us from trouble
and dishonour.  
This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu,
Earth and Heaven.
