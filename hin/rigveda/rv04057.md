### HYMN LVII. Ksetrapati, Etc.

1\. WE through the Master of the Field, even as through a friend,
obtain  
What nourisheth our kine and steeds. In such may he be good to us.  
2 As the cow yieldeth milk, pour for us freely, Lord of the Field, the
wave that beareth sweetness,  
Distilling meath, well-purified like butter, and let the. Lords of holy
Law be gracious.  
3 Sweet be the plants for us. the heavens, the waters, and full of
sweets for us be air's mid-region.  
May the Field's Lord for us be full of sweetness, and may we follow
after him uninjured.  
4 Happily work our steers and men, may the plough furrow happily.  
Happily be the traces bound; happily may he ply the goad.  
5 Śuna and Sīra, welcome ye this laud, and with the milk which ye have
made in heaven  
Bedew ye both this earth of ours.  
6 Auspicious Sītā, come thou near: we venerate and worship thee  
That thou mayst bless and prosper us and bring us fruits abundantly.  
7 May Indra press the furrow down, may Pūṣan guide its course aright.  
May she, as rich in milk, be drained for us through each succeeding
year.  
8 Happily let the shares turn up the plough-land, happily go the
ploughers with the oxen.  
With meath and milk Parjanya make us happy. Grant us prosperity, Śuna
and Sīra.
