Heritage

### HYMN CLII. Indra.

1\. A MIGHTY Governor art thou, Wondrous, Destroyer of the foe,  
Whose friend is never done to death, and never, never overcome.  
2 Lord of the clan, who brings us bliss, Strong, Warrior, Slayer of the
fiend,  
May India, Soma-drinker, go before us, Bull who gives us peace.  
3 Drive Rākṣasas and foes away, break thou in pieces Vṛtra'sjaws:  
O Vṛtra-slaying Indra, quell the foeman's wrath who threatens us.  
4 O Indra, beat our foes away, humble the men who challenge us:  
Send down to nether darkness him who seeks to do us injury.  
5 Baffle the foeman's plan, ward off his weapon who would conquer us.  
Give shelter from his furious wrath, and keep his murdering dart afar.
