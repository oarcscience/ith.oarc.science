### HYMN XI. Agni.

1\. THY blessed majesty, victorious Agni, shines brightly in the
neighbourhood of Sūrya.  
Splendid to see, it shows even at nighttime, and food is fair to look on
in thy beauty.  
2 Agni, disclose his thought for him who singeth, the well, Strong God!
while thou art praised with fervour.  
Vouchsafe to us that powerful hymn, O Mighty, which, Radiant One! with
all the Gods thou lovest.  
3 From thee, O Agni, springs poetic wisdom, from thee come thoughts and
hymns of praise that prosper;  
From thee flows wealth, with heroes to adorn it, to the true-hearted man
who gives oblation.  
4 From thee the hero springs who wins the booty, bringer of help,
mighty, of real courage.  
From thee comes wealth, sent by the Gods, bliss-giving; Agni, from thee
the fleet impetuous charger.  
5 Immortal Agni, thee whose voice is pleasant, as first in rank, as God,
religious mortals  
Invite with hymns; thee who removest hatred, Friend of the Home, the
household's Lord, unerring.  
6 Far from us thou removest want and sorrow, far from us all ill-will
when thou protectest.  
Son of Strength, Agni, blest is he at evening, whom thou as God
attendest for his welfare.
