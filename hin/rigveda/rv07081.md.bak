### HYMN LXXXI. Dawn.

1\. ADVANCING, sending forth her rays, the Daughter of the Sky is
seen.  
Uncovering, that we may see, the mighty gloom, the friendly Lady makes
the light.  
2 The Sun ascending, the refulgent Star, pours down his beams together
with the Dawn.  
O Dawn, at thine arising, and the Sun's, may we attain the share
allotted us.  
3 Promptly we woke to welcome thee, O Uṣas, Daughter of the Sky,  
Thee, Bounteous One, who bringest all we long to have, and to the
offerer health and wealth.  
4 Thou, dawning, workest fain to light the great world, yea, heaven,
Goddess! that it may be seen.  
We yearn to be thine own, Dealer of Wealth: may we be to this Mother
like her sons.  
5 Bring us that wondrous bounty, Dawn, that shall be famed most far
away.  
What, Child of Heaven, thou hast of nourishment for man, bestow thou on
us to enjoy.  
6 Give to our princes opulence and immortal fame, and strength in herds
of kine to us.  
May she who prompts the wealthy, Lady of sweet strains, may Uṣas dawn
our foes away.
