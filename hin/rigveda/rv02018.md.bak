### HYMN XVIII. Indra

1\. THE rich new car hath been equipped at morning; four yokes it hath,
three whips, seven reins to guide it:  
Ten-sided, friendly to mankind, light-winner, that must be urged to
speed with prayers and wishes.  
2 This is prepared for him the first, the second, and the third time: he
is man's Priest and Herald.  
Others get offspring of another parent he goeth, as a noble Bull, with
others.  
3 To Indra's car the Bay Steeds have I harnessed, that new well-spoken
words may bring him hither.  
Here let not other worshippers detain thee, for among us are many holy
singers.  
4 Indra, come hitherward with two Bay Coursers, come thou with four,
with six when invocated.  
Come thou with eight, with ten, to drink the Soma. Here is the juice,
brave Warrior: do not scorn it.  
5 O Indra, come thou hither having harnessed thy car with twenty,
thirty, forty horses.  
Come thou with fifty well trained coursers, Indra, sixty or seventy, to
drink the Soma.  
6 Come to us hitherward, O Indra, carried by eighty, ninety, or an
hundred horses.  
This Soma juice among the Śunahotras hath been poured out, in love, to
glad thee, Indra.  
7 To this my prayer, O Indra, come thou hither: bind to thy car's pole
all thy two Bay Coursers.  
Thou art to be invoked in many places Hero, rejoice thyself in this
libation.  
8 Ne’er be my love from Indra disunited still may his liberal Milch-cow
yield us treasure.  
So may we under his supreme protection, safe in his arms, succeed in
each forth-going.  
9 Now may that wealthy Cow Of thine, O Indra, give in return a boon to
him who lauds thee.  
Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Loud may we speak, with
heroes, in assembly.
