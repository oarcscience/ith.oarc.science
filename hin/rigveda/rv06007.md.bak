### HYMN VII. Agni.

1\. Him, messenger of earth and head of heaven, Agni Vaiśvānara, born in
holy Order,  
The Sage, the King, the guest of men, a vessel fit for their mouths, the
Gods have generated.  
2 Him have they praised, mid-point of sacrifices, great cistern of
libations, seat of riches.  
Vaiśvānara, conveyer of oblations, ensign of worship, have the Gods
engendered.  
3 From thee, O Agni, springs the mighty singer, from thee come heroes
who subdue the foeman.  
O King, Vaiśvānara, bestow thou on us excellent treasures worthy to
belonged fo r.  
4 To thee, Immortal! when to life thou springest, all the Gods sing for
joy as to their infant.  
They by thy mental powers were made immortal, Vaiśvānara, when thou
shonest from thy Parents.  
5 Agni Vaiśvānara, no one hath ever resisted these thy mighty
ordinances,  
When thou, arising from thy Parents' bosom, foundest the light for days'
appointed courses.  
6 The summits of the heaven are traversed through and through by the
Immortal's light, Vaiśvānara's brilliancy.  
All creatures in existence rest upon his head. The Seven swift-flowing
Streams have grown like branches forth,  
7 Vaiśvānara, who measured out the realms of air, Sage very wise who
made the lucid spheres of heaven,  
The Undeceivable who spread out all the worlds, keeper is he and guard
of immortality.
