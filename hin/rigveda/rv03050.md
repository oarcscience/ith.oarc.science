### HYMN L. Indra.

1\. LET Indra drink, All-hail! for his is Soma,—the mighty Bull come,
girt by Maruts, hither.  
Far-reaching, let him fill him with these viands, and let our offering
sate his body's longing.  
2 I yoke thy pair of trusty Steeds for swiftness, whose faithful service
from of old thou lovest.  
Here, fair of cheek! let thy Bay Coursers place thee: drink of this
lovely welleffused libation.  
3 With milk they made Indra their good Preserver, lauding for help and
rule the bounteous rainer.  
Impetuous God, when thou hast drunk the Soma, enraptured send us cattle
in abundance.  
4 With kine and horses satisfy this longing with very splendid bounty
still extend it.  
Seeking the light, with hymns to thee, O Indra, the Kuśikas have brought
their gift, the singers.  
5 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where
spoil is gathered;  
The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras,
wins and gathers riches.
