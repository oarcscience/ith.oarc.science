### HYMN CXVI. Aśvins.

1\. I TRIM like grass my song for the Nāsatyas and send their lauds
forth as the wind drives rain-clouds,  
Who, in a chariot rapid as an arrow, brought to the youthful Vimada a
consort.  
2 Borne on by rapid steeds of mighty pinion, or proudly trusting in the
Gods’ incitements.  
That stallion ass of yours won, O Nāsatyas, that thousand in the race,
in Yama's contest.  
3 Yea, Aśvins, as a dead man leaves his riches, Tugra left Bhujyu in the
cloud of waters.  
Ye brought him back in animated vessels, traversing air, unwetted by the
billows.  
4 Bhujyu ye bore with winged things, Nāsatyas, which for three nights,
three days full swiftly travelled,  
To the sea's farther shore, the strand of ocean, in three cars,
hundred-footed, with six horses.  
5 Ye wrought that hero exploit in the ocean which giveth no support, or
hold or station,  
What time ye carried Bhujyu to his dwelling, borne in a ship with
hundred oars, O Aśvins.  
6 The white horse which of old ye gave Aghāśva, Aśvins, a gift to be his
wealth for ever,—  
Still to be praised is that your glorious present, still to be famed is
the brave horse of Pedu.  
7 O Heroes, ye gave wisdom to Kakṣīvān who sprang from Pajra's line, who
sang your praises.  
Ye poured forth from the hoof of your strong charger a hundred jars of
wine as from a strainer.  
8 Ye warded off with cold the fire's fierce burning; food very rich in
nourishment ye furnished.  
Atri, cast downward in the cavern, Aśvins ye brought, with all his
people, forth to comfort.  
9 Ye lifted up the well, O ye Nāsatyas, and set the base on high to open
downward.  
Streams flowed for folk of Gotama who thirsted, like rain to bring forth
thousandfold abundance.  
10 Ye from the old Cyavāna, O Nāsatyas, stripped, as ’twere mail, the
skin upon  
his body,  
Lengthened his life when all had left him helpless, Dasras! and made him
lord of youthful maidens.  
11 Worthy of praise and worth the winning, Heroes, is that your
favouring succour O Nāsatyas,  
What time ye, knowing well his case, delivered Vandana from the pit like
hidden treasure.  
12 That mighty deed of yours, for gain, O Heroes, as thunder heraldeth
the rain, I publish,  
When, by the horse's head, Atharvan's offspring Dadhyac made known to
you the Soma's sweetness.  
13 In the great rite the wise dame called, Nāsatyas, you, Lords of many
treasures, to assist her.  
Ye heard the weakling's wife, as ’twere an order, and gave to her a son
Hiraṇyahasta.  
14 Ye from the wolf's jaws, as ye stood together, set free the quail, O
Heroes, O Nāsatyas.  
Ye, Lords of many treasures, gave the poet his perfect vision as he
mourned his trouble.  
15 When in the time of night, in Khela's battle, a leg was severed like
a wild bird's pinion,  
Straight ye gave Viśpalā a leg of iron that she might move what time the
conflict opened.  
16 His father robbed Ṛjrāśva of his eyesight who for the she-wolf slew a
hundred wethers.  
Ye gave him eyes, Nāsatyas, Wonder-Workers, Physicians, that he saw with
sight uninjured.  
17 The Daughter of the Sun your car ascended, first reaching as it were
the goal with coursers.  
All Deities within their hearts assented, and ye, Nāsatyas, are close
linked with glory.  
18 When to his house ye came, to Divodāsa, hasting to Bharadvāja, O ye
Aśvins,  
The car that came with you brought splendid riches: a porpoise and a
bull were yoked together.  
19 Ye, bringing wealth with rule, and life with offspring, life rich in
noble heroes; O Nāsatyas,  
Accordant came with strength to Jahnu's children who offered you thrice
every day your portion.  
20 Ye bore away at night by easy pathways Jāhuṣa compassed round on
every quarter,  
And, with your car that cleaves the toe asunder, Nāsatyas never
decaying! rent the mountains.  
21 One morn ye strengthened Vaśa for the battle, to gather spoils that
might be told in thousands.  
With Indra joined ye drove away misfortunes, yea foes of Pṛthuśravas, O
ye mighty.  
22 From the deep well ye raised on high the water, so that Ṛcatka's son,
Sara, should drink it;  
And with your might, to help the weary Śayu, ye made the barren cow
yield milk, Nāsatyas.  
23 To Viśvaka, Nāsatyas! son of Kṛṣṇa, the righteous man who sought your
aid and praised you,  
Ye with your powers restored, like some lost creature, his son Viṣṇāpū
for his eyes to look on.  
24 Aśvins, ye raised, like Soma in a ladle Rebha, who for ten days and
ten nights, fettered.  
Had lain in cruel bonds, immersed and wounded, suffering sore
affliction, in the waters.  
25 1 have declared your wondrous deeds, O Aśvins: may this be mine, and
many kine and heroes.  
May I, enjoying lengthened life, still seeing, enter old age as ’twere
the house I live in.
