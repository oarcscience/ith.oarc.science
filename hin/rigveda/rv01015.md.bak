### HYMN XV. Ṛtu.

1 O INDRA drink the Soma juice with Ṛtu; let the cheering drops  
Sink deep within, which settle there.  
2 Drink from the Purifier's cup, Maruts, with Ṛtu; sanctify  
The rite, for ye give precious gifts.  
3 O Neṣṭar, with thy Dame accept our sacrifice; with Ṛtu drink,  
For thou art he who giveth wealth.  
4 Bring the Gods, Agni; in the three appointed places set them down:  
Surround them, and with Ṛtu drink.  
5 Drink Soma after the Ṛtus, from the Brāhmaṇa's bounty: undissolved,  
O Indra, is thy friendship's bond.  
6 Mitra, Varuṇa, ye whose ways are firm—a Power that none deceives—,  
With Ṛtu ye have reached the rite.  
7 The Soma-pressers, fain for wealth, praise the Wealth-giver in the
rite,  
In sacrifices praise the God.  
8 May the Wealth-giver grant to us riches that shall be far renowned.  
These things we gain, among the Gods.  
9 He with the Ṛtu fain would drink, Wealth-giver, from the Neṣṭar's
bowl.  
Haste, give your offering, and depart.  
10 As we this fourth time, Wealth-giver, honour thee with the Ṛtus, be  
A Giver bountiful to us.  
11 Drink ye the meath, O Aśvins bright with flames, whose acts are pure,
who with  
Ṛtus accept the sacrifice.  
12 With Ṛtu, through the house-fire, thou, kind Giver, guidest
sacrifice:  
Worship the Gods for the pious man.
