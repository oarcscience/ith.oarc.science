*Rig Veda*, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, \[1896\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### HYMN LXVI. Agni.

1\. LIKE the Sun's glance, like wealth of varied sort, like breath which
is the life, like one's own son,  
Like a swift bird, a cow who yields her milk, pure and refulgent to the
wood he speeds.  
2 He offers safety like a pleasant home, like ripened corn, the
Conqueror of men.  
Like a Seer lauding, famed among the folk; like a steed friendly he
vouchsafes us power.  
3 With flame insatiate, like eternal might; caring for each one like a
dame at home;  
Bright when he shines forth, whitish mid the folk, like a car,
gold-decked, thundering to the fight.  
4 He strikes with terror like a dart shot forth, e’en like an archer's
arrow tipped with flame;  
Master of present and of future life, the maidens’ lover and the
matrons’ Lord.  
5 To him lead all your ways: may we attain the kindled God as cows their
home at eve.  
He drives the flames below as floods their swell: the rays rise up to
the fair place of heaven.
