Heritage

### HYMN XLI. Indra.

1\. COME gracious to our sacrifice, O Indra: pressed Soma-drops are
purified to please thee.  
As cattle seek their home, so Thunderwielder, come, Indra, first of
those who claim our worship.  
2 With that well-formed most wide-extending palate, wherewith thou ever
drinkest streams of sweetness,  
Drink thou; the Adhvaryu standeth up before thee: let thy spoil-winning
thunderbolt attend thee.  
3 This drop, steer-strong and omniform, the Soma, hath been made ready
for the Bull, for India.  
Drink this, Lord of the Bays, thou Strong Supporter, this that is thine
of old, thy food for ever.  
4 Soma when pressed excels the unpressed Soma, better, for one who
knows, to give him pleasure.  
Come to this sacrifice of ours, O Victor replenish all thy powers with
this libation.  
5 We call on thee, O Indra: come thou hither: sufficient be the Soma for
thy body.  
Rejoice thee, Śatakratu! in the juices guard us in wars, guard us among
our people.
