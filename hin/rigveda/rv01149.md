Heritage

### HYMN CXLIX. Agni.

1\. HITHER he hastens to give, Lord of great riches, King of the mighty,
to the place of treasure.  
The pressing-stones shall serve him speeding near us.  
2 As Steer of men so Steer of earth and heaven by glory, he whose
streams all life hath drunken,  
Who hasting forward rests upon the altar.  
3 He who hath lighted up the joyous castle, wise Courser like the Steed
of cloudy heaven,  
Bright like the Sun, with hundredfold existence.  
4 He, doubly born, hath spread in his effulgence through the three
luminous realms, through all the regions,  
Best sacrificing Priest where waters gather.  
5 Priest doubly born, he through his love of glory hath in his keeping
all things worth the choosing,  
The man who brings him gifts hath noble offspring.
