### HYMN LXXII. Aśvins.

1\. COME, O Nāsatyas, on your car resplendent, rich in abundant wealth
of kine and horses.  
As harnessed steeds, all our laudations follow you whose forms shine
with most delightful beauty.  
2 Come with the Gods associate, come ye hither to us, Nāsatyas, with
your car accordant.  
'Twixt you and us there is ancestral friendship and common kin: remember
and regard it.  
3 Awakened are the songs that praise the Aśvins, the kindred prayers and
the Celestial Mornings.  
Inviting those we long for, Earth and Heaven, the singer calleth these
Nāsatyas hither.  
4 What time the Dawns break forth in light, O Aśvins, to you the poets
offer their devotions.  
God Savitar hath sent aloft his splendour, and fires sing praises with
the kindled fuel.  
5 Come from the west, come from the cast, Nāsatyas, come, Aśvins, from
below and from above us.  
Bring wealth from all sides for the Fivefold People. Preserve us
evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
