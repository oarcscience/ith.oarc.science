### HYMN CXI. Soma Pavamana.

1\. WITH this his golden splendour purifying him, he with his own allies
subdues all enemies, as Sara with his own allies.  
Cleansing himself with stream of juice he shines forth yellow-hued and
red, when with the praisers he encompasses all forms, with praisers
having seven mouths.  
2 That treasure of the Paṇis thou discoveredst; thou with thy mothers
deckest thee in thine abode, with songs of worship in thine home.  
As ’twere from far, the hymn is heard, where holy songs resound in joy.
He with the ruddy-hued, threefold hath won life-power, he, glittering,
hath won life-power.  
3 He moves intelligent, directed to the East. The very beauteous car
rivals the beams of light, the beautiful celestial car.  
Hymns, lauding manly valour, came, inciting Indra to success, that ye
may be unconquered, both thy bolt and thou, both be unconquered in the
war.
