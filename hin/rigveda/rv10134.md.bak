### HYMN CXXXIV. Indra.

1\. As, like the Morning, thou hast filled, O Indra, both the earth and
heaven.  
So as the Mighty One, great King of all the mighty world of men, the
Goddess Mother brought thee forth, the Blessed Mother gave thee life.  
2 Relax that mortal's stubborn strength whose heart is bent on
wickedness.  
Trample him down beneath thy feet who watches for and aims at us. The
Goddess Mother brought thee forth, the Blessed Mother gave thee life.  
3 Shake down, O Slayer of the foe, those great all splendid enemies.  
With all thy powers, O Śakra, all thine helps, O Indra, shake them
down:  
4 As thou, O Śatakratu, thou, O Indrv, shakest all things down  
As wealth for him who sheds the juice, with thine assistance
thousandfold.  
5 Around, on every side like drops of sweat let lightning-flashes
fall.  
Let all malevolence pass away from us like threads of Darva grass.  
6 Thou bearest in thine hand a lance like a long hook, great
Counsellor!  
As with his foremost foot a goat, draw down the branch, O Maghavan.  
7 Never, O Gods, do we offend, nor are we ever obstinate: we walk as
holy texts command.  
Closely we clasp and cling to you, cling to your sides, beneath your
arms.
