### HYMN LXIX. Indra-Viṣṇu

1\. INDRA and Viṣṇu, at my task's completion I urge you on with food and
sacred service.  
Accept the sacrifice and grant us riches, leading us on by unobstructed
pathways.  
2 Ye who inspire all hymns, Indra and Viṣṇu, ye vessels who contain the
Soma juices,  
May hymns of praise that now are sung address you, the lauds that are
recited by the singers.  
3 Lords of joy-giving draughts, Indra and Viṣṇu, come, giving gifts of
treasure, to the Soma.  
With brilliant rays of hymns let chanted praises, repeated with the
lauds, adorn and deck you.  
4 May your foe-conquering horses bring you hither, Indra and Viṣṇu,
sharers of the banquet.  
Of all our hymns accept the invocations list to my prayers and hear the
songs I sing you.  
5 This your deed, Indra-Viṣṇu, must be lauded: widely ye strode in the
wild joy of Soma.  
Ye made the firmament of larger compass, and made the regions broad for
our existence.  
6 Strengthened with sacred offerings, IndraViṣṇu, first eaters, served
with worship ana oblation,  
Fed with the holy oil, vouchsafe us riches ye are the lake, the vat that
holds the Soma.  
7 Drink of this meath, O Indra, thou, and Viṣṇu; drink ye your fill of
Soma, Wonder-Workers.  
The sweet exhilarating juice hath reached you. Hear ye my prayers, give
ear unto my calling.  
8 Ye Twain have conquered, ne’er have yc been conquered: never hath
either of the Twain been vanquished.  
Ye, Indra-Viṣṇu, when ye fought the battle, produced this infinite with
three divisions.
