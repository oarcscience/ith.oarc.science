### HYMN XXXIV. Ṛbhus.

1\. To this our sacrifice come Ṛbhu, Vibhvan, Vāja, and Indra with the
gift of riches,  
Because this day hath Dhiṣaṇā the Goddess set drink for you: the
gladdening draughts have reached you.  
2 Knowing your birth and rich in gathered treasure, Ṛbhus, rejoice
together with the Ṛtus.  
The gladdening draughts and wisdom have approached you: send ye us
riches with good store of heroes.  
3 For you was made this sacrifice, O Ṛbhus, which ye, like men, won for
yourselves aforetime.  
To you come all who find in you their pleasure: ye all were—even the two
elder—Vājas.  
4 Now for the mortal worshipper, O Heroes, for him who served you, was
the gift of riches.  
Drink, Vājas, Ṛbhus! unto you is offered, to gladden you, the third and
great libation.  
5 Come to us, Heroes, Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans, glorified for the sake of
mighty treasure.  
These draughts approach you as the day is closing, as cows, whose calves
are newly-born, their stable.  
6 Come to this sacrifice of ours, ye Children of Strength, invoked with
humble adoration.  
Drink of this meath, Wealth-givers, joined with Indra with whom ye are
in full accord, ye Princes.  
7 Close knit with Varuṇa drink the Soma, Indra; close-knit, Hymn-lover!
with the Maruts drink it:  
Close-knit with drinkers first, who drink in season; close-knit with
heavenly Dames who give us treasures.  
8 Rejoice in full accord with the Ādityas, in concord with the Parvatas,
O Ṛbhus;  
In full accord with Savitar, Divine One; in full accord with floods that
pour forth riches.  
9 Ṛbhus, who helped their Parents and the Aśvins, who formed the
Milch-cow and the pair of horses,  
Made armour, set the heaven and earth asunder,—far- reaching Heroes,
they have made good offspring.  
10 Ye who have wealth in cattle and in booty, in heroes, in rich
sustenance and treasure,  
Such, O ye Ṛbhus, first to drink, rejoicing, give unto us and those who
laud our present.  
11 Ye were not far: we have not left you thirsting, blameless in this
our sacrifice, O Ṛbhus.  
Rejoice you with the Maruts and with Indra, with the Kings, Gods! that
ye may give us riches.
