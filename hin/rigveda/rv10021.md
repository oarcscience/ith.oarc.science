### HYMN XXI. Agni.

1\. WITH offerings of our own we choose thee, Agni, as Invoking
Priest,  
For sacrifice with trimmed grass,—at your glad carouse-piercing and
brightly shining. Thou art waxing great.  
2 The wealthy ones adorn thee, they who bring us horses as their gift:  
The sprinkling ladle, Agni,—at your glad carouse -and glowing offering
taste thee. Thou art waxing great.  
3 The holy statutes rest by thee, as ’twere with ladles that o’erflow.  
Black and white-gleaming colours,—at your glad carouse-all glories thou
assurnest. Thou art waxing great.  
4 O Agni, what thou deemest wealth, Victorious and Immortal One!  
Bring thou to give us vigour,—at your glad carouse -splendid at
sacrifices. Thou art waxing great.  
5 Skilled in all lore is Agni, he whom erst Atharvan brought to life.  
He was Vivasvān's envoy, at your glad carouse-the weIl-loved friend of
Yama, Thou art waxing great.  
6 At sacrifices they adore thee, Agni, when the rite proceeds.  
All fair and lovely treasures-at your glad carouse-thou givest him who
offers. Thou art waxing great.  
7 Men, Agni, have established thee as welcome Priest at holy rites,  
Thee whose face shines with butter,—at your glad carouse-bright, with
eyes most observant. Thou art waxing great.  
8 Wide and aloft thou spreadest thee, O Agni, with thy brilliant
flame.  
A Bull art thou when bellowing,—at your glad carouse-thou dost impregn
the Sisters. Thou art waxing great.
