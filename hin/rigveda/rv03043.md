### HYMN XLIII. Indra.

1\. MOUNTED upon thy chariot-seat approach us: thine is the Soma-draught
from days aforetime.  
Loose for the sacred grass thy dear companions. These men who bring
oblation call thee hither.  
2 Come our true Friend, passing by many people; come with thy two Bay
Steeds to our devotions;  
For these our hymns are calling thee, O Indra, hymns formed for praise,
soliciting thy friendship.  
3 Pleased, with thy Bay Steeds, Indra, God, come quickly to this our
sacrifice that heightens worship;  
For with my thoughts, presenting oil to feed thee, I call thee to the
feast of sweet libations.  
4 Yea, let thy two Bay Stallions bear thee hither, well limbed and good
to draw, thy dear companions.  
Pleased with the corn-blent offering which we bring thee, may Indra,
Friend, hear his friend's adoration.  
5 Wilt thou not make me guardian of the people, make me, impetuous
Maghavan, their ruler?  
Make me a Ṛṣi having drunk of Soma? Wilt thou not give me wealth that
lasts for ever?  
6 Yoked to thy chariot, led thy tall Bays, Indra, companions of thy
banquet, bear thee hither,  
Who from of old press to heaven's farthest limits, the Bull's impetuous
and well-groomed Horses.  
7 Drink of the strong pressed out by strong ones, Indra, that which the
Falcon brought thee when thou longedst;  
In whose wild joy thou stirrest up the people, in whose wild joy thou
didst unbar the cow-stalls.  
8 Call we on Indra, Makhavan, auspicious, best Hero in the fight where
spoil is gathered;  
The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras,
wins and gathers riches.
