### HYMN CLXXVIII. Indra.

1\. IF, Indra, thou hast given that gracious hearing where with thou
helpest those who sang thy praises.  
Blast not the wish that would exalt us may I gain all from thee, and pay
all man's devotions.  
2 Let not the Sovran Indra disappoint us in what shall bring both
Sisters to our dwelling.  
To him have run the quickly flowing waters. May Indra come to us with
life and friendship.  
3 Victorious with the men, Hero in battles, Indra, who hears the
singer's supplication,  
Will bring his car nigh to the man who offers, if he himself upholds the
songs that praise him.  
4 Yea, Indra, with the men, through love of glory consumes the sacred
food which friends have offered.  
The ever-strengthening song of him who worships is sung in fight amid
the clash of voices.  
5 Aided by thee, O Maghavan, O Indra, may we subdue our foes who count
them mighty.  
Be our protector, strengthen and increase us. May we find strengthening
food in full abundance.
