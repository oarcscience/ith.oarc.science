### HYMN CI. Indra.

1\. SING, with oblation, praise to him who maketh glad, who with Ṛjiśvan
drove the dusky brood away.  
Fain for help, him the strong whose right hand wields the bolt, him girt
by Maruts we invoke to be our Friend.  
2 Indra, who with triumphant wrath smote Vyaṁsa down, and Śambara, and
Pipru the unrighteous one;  
Who extirpated Śuṣṇa the insatiate,—him girt by Maruts we invoke to be
our Friend.  
3 He whose great work of manly might is heaven and earth, and Varuṇa and
Sūrya keep his holy law;  
Indra, whose law the rivers follow as they flow,—him girt by Maruts we
invoke to be our Friend.  
4 He who is Lord and Master of the steeds and kine, honoured—the firm
and sure—at every holy act;  
Stayer even of the strong who pours no offering out,—him girt by Maruts
we invoke to be our Friend.  
5 He who is Lord of all the world that moves and breathes, who for the
Brahman first before all found the Cows;  
Indra who cast the Dasyus down beneath his feet,—him girt by Maruts we
invoke to be our Friend.  
6 Whom cowards must invoke and valiant men of war, invoked by those who
conquer and by those who flee;  
Indra, to whom all beings turn their constant thought,—him girt by
Maruts we invoke to be our Friend.  
7 Refulgent in the Rudras’ region he proceeds, and with the Rudras
through the wide space speeds the Dame.  
The hymn of praise extols Indra the far-renowned: him girt by Maruts we
invoke to be our Friend.  
8 O girt by Maruts, whether thou delight thee in loftiest
gathering-place or lowly dwelling,  
Come thence unto our rite, true boon-bestower: through love of thee have
we prepared oblations.  
9 We, fain for thee, strong Indra, have pressed Soma, and, O thou sought
with prayer, have made oblations.  
Now at this sacrifice, with all thy Maruts, on sacred grass, O
team-borne God, rejoice thee.  
10 Rejoice thee with thine own Bay Steeds, O Indra, unclose thy jaws and
let thy lips be open.  
Thou with the fair cheek, let thy Bay Steeds bring thee: gracious to us,
he pleased with our oblation.  
11 Guards of the camp whose praisers are the Maruts, may we through
Indra, get ourselves the booty.  
This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu,
Earth and Heaven.
