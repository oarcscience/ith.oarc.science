### HYMN XI. Agni.

1\. EAGERLY Sacrifice thou, most skilful, Agni! Priest, pressing on as
if the Maruts sent thee.  
To our oblation bring the two Nāsatyas, Mitra and Varuṇa and Earth and
Heaven.  
2 Thou art our guileless, most delightful Herald, the God, among
mankind, of holy synods.  
A Priest with purifying tongue, O Agni, sacrifice with thy mouth to
thine own body.  
3 For even the blessed longing that is in thee would bring the Gods down
to the singer's worship,  
When the Aṅgirases' sagest Sage, the Poet, sings the sweet measure at
the solemn service.  
4 Bright hath he beamed, the wise, the far-refulgent. Worship the two
widespreading Worlds, O Agni,  
Whom as the Living One rich in oblations the Five Tribes, bringing
gifts, adorn with homage.  
5 When I with reverence clip the grass for Agni, when the trimmed ladle,
fullof oil, is lifted,  
Firm on the seat of earth is based the altar: eye-like, the sacrifice is
directed Sun-ward.  
6 Enrich us, O thou Priest of many aspects, with the Gods, Agni, with
thy fires, enkindled.  
O Son of Strength, clad in the robe of riches, may we escape from woe as
from  
a prison.
