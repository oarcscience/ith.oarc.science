### HYMN LXV. Agni.

1\. ONE-MINDED, wise, they tracked thee like a thief lurking in dark
cave with a stolen cow:  
Thee claiming worship, bearing it to Gods: there nigh to thee sate all
the Holy Ones.  
2 The Gods approached the ways of holy Law; there was a gathering vast
as heaven itself.  
The waters feed with praise the growing Babe, born nobly in the womb,
the seat of Law.  
3 Like grateful food, like some wide dwelling place, like a
fruit-bearing hill, a wholesome stream.  
Like a steed urged to run in swift career, rushing like Sindhu, who may
check his course?  
4 Kin as a brother to his sister floods, he eats the woods as a King
eats the rich.  
When through the forest, urged by wind, he spreads, verily Agni shears
the hair of earth.  
5 Like a swan sitting in the floods he pants wisest in mind mid men he
wakes at morn.  
A Sage like Soma, sprung from Law, he grew like some young creature,
mighty, shining far.
