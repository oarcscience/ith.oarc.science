### HYMN LXXXI. Visvakarman.

1\. HE who sate down as Hotar-priest, the Ṛṣi, our Father, offering up
all things existing,—  
He, seeking through his wish a great possession, came among men on earth
as archetypal.  
2 What was the place whereon he took his station? What was it that
supported him? How was it?  
Whence Visvakarman, seeing all, producing the earth, with mighty power
disclosed the heavens.  
3 He who hath eyes on all sides round about him, a mouth on all sides,
arms and feet on all sides,  
He, the Sole God, producing earth and heaven, weldeth them, with his
arms as wings, together.  
4 What was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from which they
fashioned out the earth and heaven?  
Ye thoughtful men inquire within your spirit whereon he stood when he
established all things.  
5 Nine highest, lowest, sacrificial natures, and these thy mid-most
here, O Visvakarman,  
Teach thou thy friends at sacrifice, O Blessed, and come thyself,
exalted, to our worship.  
6 Bring thou thyself, exalted with oblation, O Visvakarman, Earth and
Heaven to worship.  
Let other men around us live in folly here let us have a rich and
liberal patron.  
7 Let us invoke to-day, to aid our labour, the Lord of Speech, the
thought-swift Visvakarman.  
May he hear kindly all our invocations who gives all bliss for aid,
whose works are righteous.
