### HYMN LXV Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. FULL wise is he who hath discerned: let him speak to us of the
Gods,—  
The man whose praise-songs Varuṇa the beautiful, or Mitra, loves.  
2 For they are Kings of noblest might, of glorious fame most widely
spread;  
Lords of the brave, who strengthen Law, the Holy Ones with every race.  
3 Approaching you with prayer for aid, together I address you first  
We who have good steeds call on you, Most Sage, to give us strength
besides.  
4 E’en out of misery Mitra gives a way to dwelling at our case,  
For he who worships hath the grace of Mitra, fighter in the van. '  
5 In Mitra's shelter that extends to utmost distance may we dwell,  
Unmenaced, guarded by the care, ever as sons of Varuṇa.  
6 Ye, Mitra, urge this people on, and to one end direct their ways.  
Neglect not ye the wealthy chiefs, neglect not us the Ṛṣis: be our
guardians when ye quaff the milk.
