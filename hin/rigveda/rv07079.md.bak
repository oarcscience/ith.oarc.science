### HYMN LXXIX. Dawn.

1\. ROUSING the lands where men's Five Tribes are settled, Dawn hath
disclosed the pathways of the people.  
She hath sent out her sheen with beauteous oxen. The Sun with light hath
opened earth and heaven.  
2 They paint their bright rays on the sky's far limits. the Dawns come
on like tribes arrayed for battle.  
Thy cattle, closely shutting up the darkness, as Savitar spreads his
arms, give forth their lustre.  
3 Wealthy, most like to Indra, Dawn hath risen, and brought forth lauds
that shall promote our welfare.  
Daughter of Heaven, a Goddess, she distributes, best of Aṅgirases,
treasures to the pious.  
4 Bestow on us, O Dawn, that ample bounty which thou didst send to those
who sang thy praises;  
Thou whom with bellowings of a bull they quickened: thou didst unbar the
firm-set mountain's portals.  
5 Impelling every God to grant his bounty sending to us the charm of
pleasant voices,  
Vouchsafe us thoughts, for profit, as thou breakest. Preserve us
evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
