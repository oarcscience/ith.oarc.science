Heritage

### HYMN XCII. Vāyu

1\. O VĀYU, drinker of the pure, be near us: a thousand teams are thine,
Allbounteous Giver.  
To thee the rapture-bringing juice is offered, whose first draught, God,
thou takest as thy portion.  
2 Prompt at the holy rites forth came the presser with Soma-draughts for
Indra and for Vāyu,  
When ministering priests with strong devotion bring to you Twain the
first taste of the Soma.  
3 The teams wherewith thou seekest him who offers, within his home, O
Viyu, to direct him,  
Therewith send wealth: to us with full enjoyment, a hero son and gifts
of kine and horses.  
4 Near to the Gods and making Indra joyful, devout and ofFering precious
gifts to Vāyu,  
Allied with princes, smiting down the hostile, may we with heroes
conquer foes in battle.  
5 With thy yoked teams in hundreds and in thousands come to our
sacrifice and solemn worship.  
Come, Vāyu, make thee glad at this libation. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
