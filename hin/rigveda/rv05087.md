### HYMN LXXXVII. Maruts.

1\. To Viṣṇu, to the Mighty whom the Maruts follow let your hymns born
in song go forth, Evayamarut;  
To the impetuous, strong band, adorned with bracelets, that rushes on in
joy and ever roars for vigour.  
2 They who with might were manifest, and who willingly by their own
knowledge told it forth, Evayamarut.  
Maruts, this strength of yours no wisdom comprehendeth: through their
gifts' greatness they are moveless as the mountains.  
3 Who by the psalm they sing are heard, from lofty heaven, the strong,
the brightly shining Ones, Evayamarut;  
In whose abode there is no mightier one to move them, whose lightnings
are as fires, who urge the roaring rivers.  
4 He of the Mighty Stride forth strode, Evayamarut, out of the spacious
dwelling-place, their home in common.  
When he, himself, hath yoked his emulous strong horses on heights, he
cometh forth, joy-giving, with the Heroes.  
5 Like your tremendous roar, the rainer with light flashing, strong,
speeding, hath made all tremble, Evayamarut,  
Wherewith victorious ye, self-luminous, press onward, with strong reins,
decked with gold, impetuous and well-weaponed.  
6 Unbounded is your greatness, ye of mighty power: may your bright
vigour be our aid, Evayamarut;  
For ye are visible helpers in the time of trouble: like fires, aglow
with light, save us from shame and insult.  
7 So may the Rudras, mighty warriors, Evayamarut, with splendid
brilliancy, like fires, be our protectors;  
They whose terrestrial dwelling-place is wide-extended, whom none
suspect of sin, whose bands have lofty courage.  
8 Come in a friendly spirit, come to us, O Maruts, and hear his call who
praises you, Evayamarut.  
Like car-borne men, one-minded with the mighty Viṣṇu, keep enmity far
from us with your deeds of wonder.  
9 Come to our sacrifice, ye Hnly Ones, to bless it, and, free from
demons, hear our call, Evayamarut.
