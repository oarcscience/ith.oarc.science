### HYMN XV. Agni.

1\. AGNI the Herald, like a horse, is led forth at our solemn rite,  
God among Gods adorable.  
2 Three times unto our solemn rite comes Agni like a charioteer,  
Bearing the viands to the Gods.  
3 Round the oblations hath he paced, Agni the Wise, the Lord of
Strength,  
Giving the offerer precious boons.  
4 He who is kindled eastward for Sṛñjaya, Devāvata's son,  
Resplendent, tamer of the foe.  
5 So mighty be the Agni whom the mortal hero shall command,  
With sharpened teeth and bountiful.  
6 Day after day they dress him, as they clean a horse who wins the
prize.  
Dress the red Scion of the Sky.  
7 When Sahadeva's princely son with two bay horses thought of me,  
Summoned by him I drew not back.  
8 And truly those two noble bays I straightway took when offered me,  
From Sahadeva's princely son.  
9 Long, O ye Aśvins, may he live, your care, ye Gods, the princely
son.  
Of Sahadeva, Somaka.  
10 Cause him the youthful prince, the son of Sahadeva, to enjoy  
Long life, O Aśvins, O ye Gods.
