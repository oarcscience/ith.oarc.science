### HYMN XLV. Aśvins

1\. YONDER goes up that light: your chariot is yoked that travels round
upon the summit of this heaven.  
Within this car are stored three kindred shares of food, and a skin
filled with meath is rustling as the fourth.  
2 Forth come your viands rich with store of pleasant meath, and cars and
horses at the flushing of the dawn,  
Stripping the covering from the surrounded gloom, and spreading through
mid-air bright radiance like the Sun.  
3 Drink of the meath with lips accustomed to the draught; harness for
the meath's sake the chariot that ye love.  
Refresh the way ye go, refresh the paths with meath: hither, O Aśvins,
bring the skin that holds the meath.  
4 The swans ye have are friendly, rich in store of meath, gold-pinioned,
strong to draw, awake at early morn,  
Swimming the flood, exultant, fain for draughts that cheer: ye come like
flies to our libations of the meath.  
5 Well knowing solemn rites and rich in meath, the fires sing to the
morning Aśvins at the break of day,  
When with pure hands the prudent energetic priest hath with the stones
pressed out the Soma rich in meath.  
6 The rays advancing nigh, chasing with day the gloom, spread through
the firmament bright radiance like the Sun;  
And the Sun harnessing his horses goeth forth: ye through your Godlike
nature let his paths be known.  
7 Devout in thought I have declared, O Aśvins, your chariot with good
steeds, which lasts for ever,  
Wherewith ye travel swiftly through the regions to the prompt worshipper
who brings oblation.
