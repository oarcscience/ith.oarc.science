### HYMN XVIII. Agni.

1\. AGNI, be kind to us when we approach thee good as a friend to
friend, as sire and mother.  
The races of mankind are great oppressors burn up malignity that strives
against us.  
2 Agni, burn up the unfriendly who are near us, burn thou the foeman's
curse who pays no worship.  
Burn, Vasu, thou who markest well, the foolish: let thine eternal nimble
beams surround thee.  
3 With fuel, Agni, and with oil, desirous, mine offering I present for
strength and conquest,  
With prayer, so far as I have power, adoring-this hymn divine to gain a
hundred treasures.  
4 Give with thy glow, thou Son of Strength, when lauded, great vital
power to those who toil to serve thee.  
Give richly, Agni, to the Viśvāmitras in rest and stir. Oft have we
decked thy body.  
5 Give us, O liberal Lord, great store of riches, for, Agni, such art
thou when duly kindled.  
Thou in the happy singer's home bestowest, amply with arms extended,
things of beauty.
