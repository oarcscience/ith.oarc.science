### HYMN XCVIII. Indra.

1\. PRIESTS, offer to the Lord of all the people the milked-out stalk of
Soma, radiant-coloured.  
No wild-bull knows his drinking-place like Indra who ever seeks him who
hath pressed the Soma,  
2 Thou dost desire to drink, each day that passes, the pleasant food
which thou hast had aforetime,  
O Indra, gratified in heart and spirit, drink eagerly the Soma set
before thee.  
3 Thou, newly-born, for strength didst drink the Soma; the Mother told
thee of thy future greatness.  
O Indra, thou hast filled mid-air's wide region, and given the Gods by
battle room and freedom.  
4 When thou hast urged the arrocrant to combat, proud in their strength
of arm, we will subdue them.  
Or, Indra, when thou fightest girt by heroes, we in the glorious fray
with thee will conquer.  
5 I will declare the earliest deeds of Indra, and recent acts which
Maghavan hath accomplished.  
When he had conquered godless wiles and magic, Soma became his own
entire possession.  
6 Thine is this world of flocks and herds around thee, which with the
eye of Sūrya thou beholdest.  
Thou, Indra, art alone the Lord of cattle; may we enjoy the treasure
which thou givest.  
7 Ye Twain are Lords of wealth in earth and heaven, thou, O Bṛhaspati,
and thou, O Indra.  
Mean though he be, give wealth to him who lauds you. Preserve us
evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
