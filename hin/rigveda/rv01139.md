### HYMN CXXXIX. Viśvedevas.

1\. HEARD be our prayer! In thought I honour Agni first: now straightway
we elect this heavenly company, Indra and Vāyu we elect.  
For when our latest thought is raised and on Vivasvān centred well,  
Then may our holy songs go forward on their way, our songs as ’twere
unto the Gods.  
2 As there ye, Mitra, Varuṇa, above the true have taken to yourselves
the untrue with your mind, with wisdom's mental energy,  
So in the seats wherein ye dwell have we beheld the Golden One,  
Not with our thoughts or spirit, but with these our eyes, yea, with the
eyes that Soma gives.  
3 Aśvins, the pious call you with their hymns of praise, sounding their
loud song forth to you, these living men, to their oblations, living
men.  
All glories and all nourishment, Lords of all wealth! depend on you.  
The fellies of your golden chariot scatter drops, Mighty Ones! of your
golden car.  
4 Well is it known, O Mighty Ones: ye open heaven; for you the
chariot-steeds are yoked for morning rites, unswerving steeds for
morning rites,  
We set you on the chariot-seat, ye Mighty, on the golden car.  
Ye seek mid-air as by a path that leads aright, as by a path that leads
direct.  
5 O Rich in Strength, through your great power vouchsafe us blessings
day and night.  
The offerings which we bring to you shall never fail, gifts brought by
us shall never fail.  
6 These Soma-drops, strong Indra! drink for heroes, poured, pressed out
by pressing-stones, are welling forth for thee, for thee the drops are
welling forth.  
They shall make glad thy heart to give, to give wealth great and
wonderful.  
Thou who acceptest praise come glorified by hymns, come thou to us
benevolent.  
7 Quickly, O Agni, hear us: magnified by us thou shalt speck for us to
the Gods adorable yea, to the Kings adorable:  
When, O ye Deities, ye gave that Milch-cow to the Aṅgirases,  
They milked her: Aryaman, joined with them, did the work: he knoweth her
as well as I.  
8 Ne’er may these manly deeds of yours for us grow old, never may your
bright glories fall into decay, never before our time decay.  
What deed of yours, new every age, wondrous, surpassing man, rings
forth,  
Whatever, Maruts! may be difficult to gain, grant us, whate’er is hard
to gain.  
9 Dadhyac of old, Aṅgiras, Priyamedha these, and Kaṇva, Atri, Manu knew
my birth, yea, those of ancient days and Manu knew.  
Their long line stretcheth to the Gods, our birth-connexions are with
them.  
To these, for their high station, I bow down with song, to Indra, Agni,
bow with song.  
10 Let the Invoker bless: let offerers bring choice gifts; Bṛhaspati the
Friend doth sacrifice with Steers, Steers that have many an
excellence.  
Now with our ears we catch the sound of the press-stone that rings
afar.  
The very Strong hath gained the waters by himself, the strong gained
many a resting-place.  
11 O ye Eleven Gods whose home is heaven, O ye Eleven who make earth
your dwelling,  
Ye who with might, Eleven, live in waters, accept this sacrifice, O
Gods, with pleasure.
