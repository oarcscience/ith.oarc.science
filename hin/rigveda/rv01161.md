### HYMN CLXI. Ṛbhus.

1 WHY hath the Best, why hath the Youngest come to us? Upon what embassy
comes he? What have we said?  
We have not blamed the chalice of illustrious birth. We, Brother Agni,
praised the goodness of the wood.  
2 The chalice that is single make ye into four: thus have the Gods
commanded; therefore am I come.  
If, O Sudhanvan's Children, ye will do this thing ye shall participate
in sacrifice with Gods.  
3 What to the envoy Agni in reply ye spake, A courser must be made, a
chariot fashioned here,  
A cow must be created, and the Twain made young. When we have done these
things, Brother, we turn to you.  
4 When thus, O Ṛbhus, ye had done ye questioned thus, Whither went he
who came to us a messenger?  
Then Tvaṣṭar, when he viewed the four wrought chalices, concealed
himself among the Consorts of the Gods.  
5 As Tvaṣṭar thus had spoken, Let us slay these men who have reviled the
chalice, drinking-cup of Gods,  
They gave themselves new names when Soma juice was shed, and under these
new names the Maiden welcomed them.  
6 Indra hath yoked his Bays, the Aśvins' car is horsed, Bṛhaspati hath
brought the Cow of every hue.  
Ye went as Ṛbhus, Vibhvan, Vāja to the Gods, and skilled in war,
obtained your share in sacrifice.  
7 Ye by your wisdom brought a cow from out a hide; unto that ancient
Pair ye gave again their youth.  
Out of a horse, Sudhanvan's Sons, ye formed a horse: a chariot ye
equipped, and went unto the Gods.  
8 Drink ye this water, were the words ye spake to them; or drink ye
this, the rinsing of the Muñja-grass.  
If ye approve not even this, Sudhanvan's Sons, then at the third
libation gladden ye yourselves.  
9 Most excellent are waters, thus said one of you; most excellent is
Agni, thus another said.  
Another praised to many a one the lightning cloud. Then did ye shape the
cups, speaking the words of truth.  
10 One downward to the water drives the crippled cow, another trims the
flesh brought on the carving-board.  
One carries off the refuse at the set of sun. How did the Parents aid
their children in their task!  
11 On the high places ye have made the grass for man, and water in the
valleys, by your skill, O Men.  
Ṛbhus, ye iterate not to-day that act of yours, your sleeping in the
house of him whom naught can hide.  
12 As, compassing them round, ye glided through the worlds, where had
the venerable Parents their abode?  
Ye laid a curse on him who raised his arm at you: to him who spake aloud
to you ye spake again.  
13 When ye had slept your fill, ye Ṛbhus, thus ye asked, O thou whom
naught may hide, who now hath wakened us?  
The goat declared the hound to be your wakener. That day, in a full
year, ye first unclosed our eyes.  
14 The Maruts move in heaven, on earth this Agni; through the
mid-firmament the Wind approaches.  
Varuṇa comes in the sea's gathered waters, O Sons of Strength, desirous
of your presence.
