### HYMN XIII. Indra.

1\. THE Season was the parent, and when born therefrom it entered
rapidly the floods wherein it grows.  
Thence was it full of sap, streaming with milky juice: the milk of the
plant's stalk is chief and meet for lauds.  
2 They come trooping together bearing milk to him, and bring him
sustenance who gives support to all.  
The way is common for the downward streams to flow. Thou who didst these
things first art worthy of our lauds.  
3 One priest announces what the institutor gives: one, altering the
forms, zealously plies his task,  
The third corrects the imperfections left by each. Thou who didst these
things first art worthy of our lauds.  
4 Dealing out food unto their people there they sit, like wealth to him
who comes, more than the back can bear.  
Greedily with his teeth he eats the master's food. Thou who didst these
things first art worthy of our lauds.  
5 Thou hast created earth to look upon the sky: thou, slaying Ahi,
settest free the river's paths.  
Thee, such, a God, the Gods have quickened with their lauds, even as a
steed with waters: meet for praise art thou.  
6 Thou givest increase, thou dealest to us our food: thou milkest from
the moist the dry, the rich in sweets.  
Thou by the worshipper layest thy precious store: thou art sole Lord of
all. Meet for our praise art thou.  
7 Thou who hast spread abroad the streams by stablished law, and in the
field the plants that blossom and bear seed;  
Thou who hast made the matchless lightnings of the sky,—vast, compassing
vast realms, meet for our praise art thou.  
8 Who broughtest Nārmara with all his wealth, for sake of food, to slay
him that the fiends might be destroyed,  
Broughtest the face unclouded of the strengthening one, performing much
even now, worthy art thou of praise.  
9 Thou boundest up the Dāsa's hundred friends and ten, when, at one's
hearing, thou helpest thy worshipper.  
Thou for Dabhīti boundest Dasyus not with cords; Thou wast a mighty
help. Worthy of lauds art thou.  
10 All banks of rivers yielded to his manly might; to him they gave, to
him, the Strong, gave up their wealth.  
The six directions hast thou fixed, a five-fold view: thy victories
reached afar. Worthy of lauds art thou.  
11 Meet for high praise, O Hero, is thy power, that with thy single
wisdom thou obtainest wealth,  
The life-support of conquering Jātūṣṭhira. Indra, for all thy deeds,
worthy of lauds art thou.  
12 Thou for Turvīti heldest still the flowing floods, the river-stream
for Vayya easily to pass  
Didst raise the outcast from the depths, and gavest fame unto the halt
and blind. Worthy of lauds art thou.  
13 Prepare thyself to grant us that great bounty, O Vasu, for abundant
is thy treasure.  
Snatch up the wonderful, O Indra, daily. Loud may we speak, with heroes,
in assembly.
