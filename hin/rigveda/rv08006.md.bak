### HYMN VI Indra

1\. INDRA, great in his power and might, and like Parjanya rich in
rain,  
Is magnified by Vatsa's lauds.  
2 When the priests, strengthening the Son of Holy Law, present their
gifts,  
Singers with Order's hymn of praiser.  
3 Since Kaṇvas with their lauds have made Indra complete the
sacrifice.  
Words are their own appropriate arms.  
4 Before his hot displeasure all the peoples, all the men, bow down,  
As rivers bow them to the sea.  
5 This power of his shone brightly forth when Indra brought together,
like  
A skin, the worlds of heaven and earth.  
6 The fiercely-moving Vṛtra's head he severed with his thunderbolt,  
His mighty hundred-knotted bolt.  
7 Here are-we sing them loudly forth-our thoughts among-the best of
songs.  
Even lightnings like the blaze of fire.  
8 When bidden thoughts, spontaneously advancing, glow, and with the
stream  
Of sacrifice the Kaṇvas shine.  
9 Indra, may we obtain that wealth in horses and in herds of cows,  
And prayer that may be noticed first.  
10 I from my Father have received deep knowledge of the Holy Law  
I was born like unto the Sun.  
11 After the lore of ancient time I make, like Kaṇva, beauteous songs,  
And Indra's selfgains strength thereby.  
12 Whatever Ṛṣis have not praised thee, Indra, or have lauded thee,  
By me exalted wax thou strong.  
13 When his wrath thundered, when he rent Vṛtra to pieces, limb by
limb,  
He sent the waters to the sea.  
14 Against the Dasyu gusna thou, Indra, didst hurl thy during bolt:  
Thou, Dread one, hast a hero's fame.  
15 Neither the heavens nor firmaments nor regions of the earth contain  
Indra, the Thunderer with his might.  
16 O Indra him who lay at length staying thy copious waters thou,  
In his own footsteps, smotest down  
17 Thou hiddest deep in darkness itim, O Indra, who had set his grasp  
On spacious heaven and earth conjoined.  
18 Indra, whatever Yatis and Bhṛgus have offered praise to thee,  
Listen, thou Mighty, to my call.  
19 Indra, these spotted cows yield thee their butter and the milky
draught;  
Aiders, thereby, of sacrifice;  
20 Which, teeming, have received thee as a life-germ, Indra, with their
mouth,  
Like Sūrya who sustaineth all.  
21 O Lord of Might, with hymns of praise the Kaṇvas have increased thy
power,  
The drops poured forth have strengthened thee.  
22 Under thy guidance, Indra, mid thy praises, Lord of Thunder, shall  
The sacrifice be soon performed.  
23 Indra, disclose much food for us, like a stronghold with store of
kine:  
Give progeny and heroic strength.  
24 And, Indra, grant us all that wealth of fleet steeds which shone
bright of old  
Among the tribes of Nahusas.  
25 Hither thou seemest to attract heaven's fold which shines before our
eyes,  
When, Indra, thou art kind to us.  
26 Yea, when thou puttest forth thy power, Indra, thou governest the
folk.  
Mighty, unlimited in strength.  
27 The tribes who bring oblations call to thee, to thee to give them
help,  
With drops to thee who spreadest far.  
28 There where the mountains downward slope, there by the meeting of the
streams  
The Sage was manifest with song.  
29 Thence, marking, from his lofty place downward he looks upon the
sea,  
And thence with rapid stir he moves.  
30 Then, verify, they see the light refulgent of primeval seed,  
Kindled on yonder side of heaven.  
31 Indra, the Kaṇvas all exalt thy wisdom and thy manly power,  
And, Mightiest! thine heroic strength.  
32 Accept this eulogy of mine, Indra, and guard me carefully:  
Strengthen my thought and prosper it.  
33 For thee, O Mighty, Thunder-armed, we singers through devotionhave  
Fashioned the hymn that we may live.  
34 To Indra have the Kaṇvas sung, like waters speeding down a slope:  
The song is fain to go to him.  
35 As rivers swell the ocean, so our hymns of praise make Indra
strong,  
Eternal, of resistIess wrath.  
36 Come with thy lovely Bay Steeds, come to us from regions far away  
O Indra, drink this Soma juice.  
37 Best slayer of Vṛtras, men whose sacred grass is ready trimmed  
Invoke thee for the gain of spoil.  
38 The heavens and earth come after thee as the wheel follows Etaśa:  
To thee flow Soma-drops effused.  
39 Rejoice, O Indra, in the light, rejoice in Saryandyan, be Glad in the
sacrificer's hymn.  
40 Grown strong in heaven, the Thunder-armed hath bellowed,
Vṛtra-slayer, Bull,  
Chief drinker of the Soma juice.  
41 Thou art a Ṛṣi born of old, sole Ruler over all by might:  
Thou, Indra, guardest well our wealth.  
42 May thy Bay Steeds with beauteous backs, a hundred, bring thee to the
feast,  
Bring thee to these our Soma-draughts.  
43 The Kaṇvas with their hymns of praise have magnified this ancient
thought  
That swells with streams of meath and oil.  
44 Mid mightiest Gods let mortal man choose Indra at the sacrifice,  
Indra, whoe’er would win, for help.  
45 Thy steeds, by Priyamedhas praised, shall bring thee, God whom all
invoke,  
Hither to drink the Somajuice.  
46 A hundred thousand have I gained from Parsu, from Tirindira,  
And presents of the Yadavas.  
47 Ten thousand head of kine, and steeds three times a hundred they
bestowed  
On Pajra for the Sāma-song.  
48 Kakuha hath reached up to heaven, bestowing buffaloes yoked in
fours,  
And matched in fame the Yadavas.
