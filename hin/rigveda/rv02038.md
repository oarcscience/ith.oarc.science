### HYMN XXXVIII. Savitar.

1\. UPRISEN is Savitar, this God, to quicken, Priest who neglects not
this most constant duty.  
To the Gods, verily, he gives rich treasure, and blesses him who calls
them to the banquet.  
2 Having gone up on high, the God broad-handed spreads his arms widely
forth that all may mark him.  
Even the waters bend them to his service: even this wind rests in the
circling region.  
3 Though borne by swift steeds he will yet unyoke them: e’en the fleet
chariot hath he stayed from going.  
He hath checked e’en their haste who glide like serpents. Night closely
followed Savitar's dominion.  
4 What was spread out she weaves afresh, re-weaving: the skilful leaves
his labour half-completed.  
He hath arisen from rest, and parted seasons: Savitar hath approached,
God, holy-minded.  
5 Through various dwellings, through entire existence, spreads,
manifest, the household light of Agni.  
The Mother gives her Son the goodliest portion, and Savitar hath sped to
meet his summons.  
6 He comes again, unfolded, fain for conquest: at home was he, the love
of all things moving.  
Each man hath come leaving his evil doings, after the Godlike Savitar's
commandment.  
7 The wild beasts spread through desert places seeking their watery
share which thou hast set in waters.  
The woods are given to the birds. These statutes of the God Savitar none
disobeyeth.  
8 With utmost speed, in restless haste at sunset Varuṇa seeks his watery
habitation.  
Then seeks each bird his nest, each beast his lodging. In due place
Savitar hath set each creature.  
9 Him whose high law not Varuṇa nor Indra, not Mitra, Aryaman, nor Rudra
breaketh,  
Nor evil-hearted fiends, here for my welfare him I invoke, God Savitar,
with worship.  
10 May they who strengthen bliss, and thought and wisdom, and the Dames’
Lord and Narāśaṁsa aid us.  
That good may come to us and wealth be gathered, may we be Savitar the
God's beloved.  
11 So come to us our hearts' desire, the bounty bestowed by thee, from
heaven and earth and waters,  
That it be well with friends and those who praise thee, and, Savitar,
with the loud-lauding singer.
