### HYMN LXIX. Aśvins.

1\. MAY your gold chariot, drawn by vigorous horses, come to us,
blocking up the earth  
and heaven,  
Bright with its fellies while its way drops fatness, food-laden, rich in
coursers, man's protector.  
2 Let it approach, yoked by thewill, three-seated, extending far and
wide o’er fivefold beings,  
Whereon ye visit God-adoring races, bending your course whither ye will,
O Aśvins.  
3 Renowned, with noble horses, come ye hither: drink, Wondrous Pair, the
cup that holds sweet juices.  
Your car whereon your Spouse is wont to travel marks with its track the
farthest ends of heaven.  
4 When night was turning to the grey of morning the Maiden, Sūrya's
Daughter, chose your splendour.  
When with your power and might ye aid the pious he comes through heat to
life by your assistance.  
5 O Chariot-borne, this car of yours invested with rays of light comes
harnessed to our dwelling.  
Herewith, O Aśvins, while the dawn is breaking, to this our sacrifice
bring peace and blessing.  
6 Like the wild cattle thirsty for the lightning, Heroes, come nigh this
day to our libations.  
Men call on you with hymns in many places, but let not other worshippers
detain you.  
7 Bhujyu, abandoned in the midst of ocean, ye raised from out the water
with your horses,  
Uninjured, winged, flagging not, undaunted, with deeds of wonder saving
him, O Aśvins.  
8 Now hear, O Youthful Twain, mine invocation: come, Aśvins, to the home
where food aboundeth.  
Vouchsafe us wealth, do honour to our nobles. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
