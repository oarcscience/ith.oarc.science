### HYMN XCII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THE gold-hued juice, poured out upon the filter, is started like a
car sent forth to conquer.  
He hath gained song and vigour while they cleansed him, and hath
rejoiced the Gods with entertainments.  
2 He who beholdeth man hath reached the filter: bearing his name, the
Sage hath sought his dwelling.  
The Ṛṣis came to him, seven holy singers, when in the bowls he settled
as Invoker.  
3 Shared by all Gods, mobt wise, propitious, Soma goes, while they
cleanse him, to his constant station.  
Let him rejoice in all his lofty wisdom to the Five Tribes the Sage
attains with labour.  
4 In thy mysterious place, O Pavamana Soma, are all the Gods, the
Thrice-Eleven.  
Ten on the fleecy height, themselves, self-prompted, and seven fresh
rivers, brighten and adorn thee.  
5 Now let this be the truth of Pavamana, there where all singers gather
them together,  
That he hath given us room and made the daylight, hath holpen Manu and
repelled the Dasyu.  
6 As the priest seeks the station rich in cattle, like a true King who
goes to great assemblies,  
Soma hath sought the beakers while they cleansed him, and like a wild
bull, in the wood hath settled.
