### HYMN LXXXIII. Maruts.

1\. THE Cow, the famous Mother of the wealthy Maruts, pours her milk:  
Both horses of the cars are yoked,—  
2 She in whose bosom all the Gods, and Sun and Moon for men to see,  
Maintain their everlasting Laws.  
3 This all the pious sing to us, and sacred poets evermore:  
The Maruts to the Soma-draught  
4 Here is the Soma ready pressed of this the Maruts drink, of this  
Self-luminous the Aśvins drink.  
5 Of this, moreover, purified, set in three places, procreant,  
Drink Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman.  
6 And Indra, like the Herald Priest, desirous of the milky juice,  
At early morn will quaff thereof.  
7 When have the Princes gleamed and shone through waters as through
troops of foes'?  
When hasten they whose might ispure?  
8 What favour do I claim this day of you  
great Deities, you who are  
Wondrously splendid in yourselves?  
9 1 call, to drink the Soma, those Maruts who spread all realms of
earth  
And luminous regions of the sky.  
10 You, even such, pure in your might, you, O ye Maruts, I invoke  
From heaven to drink this Somajuice.  
11 The Maruts, those who have sustained and propped the heavens and
earth apart,  
I call to drink this Soma juice.  
12 That vigorous band of Maruts that abidetb in the mountains, I  
Invoke to drink this Soma juice.
