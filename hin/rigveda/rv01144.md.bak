### HYMN CXLIV. Agni.

1\. THE Priest goes forth to sacrifice, with wondrous power sending
aloft the hymn of glorious brilliancy.  
He moves to meet the ladles turning to the right, which are the first to
kiss the place where he abides.  
2 To him sang forth the flowing streams of Holy Law, encompassed in the
home and birth-place of the God.  
He, when he dwelt extended in the waters’ lap, absorbed those Godlike
powers for which he is adored.  
3 Seeking in course altern to reach the selfsame end the two copartners
strive to win this beauteous form.  
Like Bhaga must he be duly invoked by us, as he who drives the car holds
fast the horse's reins.  
4 He whom the two copartners with observance tend, the pair who dwell
together in the same abode,  
By night as in the day the grey one was born young, passing untouched by
eld through many an age of man.  
5 Him the ten fingers, the devotions, animate: we mortals call on him a
God to give us help.  
He speeds over the sloping surface of the land: new deeds hath he
performed with those who gird him round.  
6 For, Agni, like a herdsman, thou by thine own might rulest o’er all
that is in heaven and on the earth;  
And these two Mighty Ones, bright, golden closely joined, rolling them
round are come unto thy sacred grass.  
7 Agni, accept with joy, be glad in this our prayer, joy-giver,
self-sustained, strong, born of Holy Law!  
For fair to see art thou turning to every side, pleasant to look on as a
dwelling filled with food.
