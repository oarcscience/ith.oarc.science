### HYMN LIV. Savitar.

1\. Now must we praise and honour Savitar the God: at this time of the
day the men must call to him,  
Him who distributes wealth to Manu's progeny, that he may grant us here
riches most excellent.  
2 For thou at first producest for the holy Gods the noblest of all
portions, immortality:  
Thereafter as a gift to men, O Savitar, thou openest existence, life
succeeding life.  
3 If we, men as we are, have sinned against the Gods through want of
thought, in weakness, or through insolence,  
Absolve us from the guilt and make us free from sin, O Savitar, alike
among both Gods and men.  
4 None may impede that power of Savitar the God whereby he will maintain
the universal world.  
What the fair-fingered God brings forth on earth's expanse or in the
height of heaven, that work of his stands sure.  
5 To lofty hills thou sendest those whom Indra leads, and givest fixed
abodes with houses unto these.  
However they may fly and draw themselves apart, still, Savitar, they
stand obeying thy behest.  
6 May the libations poured to thee thrice daily, day after day, O
Savitar, bring us blessing.  
May Indra, Heaven, Earth, Sindhu with the Waters, Aditi with Ādityas,
give us shelter.
