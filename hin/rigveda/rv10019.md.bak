### HYMN XIX. Waters or Cows.

1\. TURN, go not farther on your way: visit us, O ye Wealthy Ones.  
Agni and Soma, ye who bring riches again, secure us wealth.  
2 Make these return to us again, bring them beside us once again.  
May. Indra give them back to us, and Agni drive them hither-ward.  
3 Let them return to us again: under this herdsman let them feed.  
Do thou, O Agni, keep them here, and let the wealth we have remain.  
4 1 call upon their herdsman, him who knoweth well their coming nigh,  
Their parting and their home-return, and watcheth their approach and
rest.  
5 Yea, let the herdsman, too, return, who marketh well their
driving-forth;  
Marketh their wandering away, their turning back and coming home.  
6 Home-leader, lead them home to us; Indra, restore to us our kine:  
We will rejoice in them alive.  
7 1 offer you on every side butter and milk and strengthening food.  
May all the Holy Deities pour down on us a flood of wealth.  
8 O thou Home-leader, lead them home, restore them thou who bringest
home.  
Four are the quarters of the earth; from these bring back to us our
kine,
