### HYMN CXI. Indra.

1\. BRING forth your sacred song ye prudent singers, even as are the
thoughts of human beings.  
Let us draw Indra with true deeds anear us: he loves our songs, the
Hero, and is potent.  
2 The hymn shone brightly from the seat of worship: to the kine came the
Bull, the Heifer's Offipring  
With mighty bellowing hath he arisen, and hath pervaded even the
spacious regions.  
3 Indra knows, verily, how to hear our singing, for he, victorious, made
a path for Sūrya.  
He made the Cow, and be became the Sovran of Heaven, primeval,
matchless, and unshaken.  
4 Praised by Aṅgirases, Indra demolished with might the works of the
great watery monster  
Full many regions, too, hath he pervaded, and by his truth supported
earth's foundation.  
5 The counterpart of heaven and earth is Indra: he knoweth all
libations, slayeth Śuṣṇa.  
The vast sky with the Sun hath he extended, and, best otpillars, stayed
it with a pillar.  
6 The Vṛtra-slaver with his bolt felled Vṛtra: the magic of the godless,
waxen mighty,  
Here hast thou, Bold Assailant, boldly conquered. Yea, then thine arms,
O Maghavan, were potent.  
7 When the Dawns come attendant upon Sūrya their rays discover wealth of
divers colours.  
The Star of heaven is seen as ’twere approaching: none knoweth aught of
it as it departeth.  
8 Far have they gone, the first of all these waters, the waters that
flowed forth when Indra sent them.  
Where is their spring, and where is their foundation? Where now, ye
Waters, is your inmost centre?  
9 Thou didst free rivers swallowed by the Dragon; and rapidly they set
themselves in motion,  
Those that were loosed and those that longed for freedom. Excited now to
speed they run unresting.  
10 Yearning together they have sped to Sindhu: the Fort-destroyer,
praised, of old, hath loved them.  
Indra, may thy terrestrial treasures reach us, and our full songs of joy
approach thy dwelling.
