### HYMN LXXV. Soma Pavamana.

1\. GRACIOUSLY-MINDED he is flowing on his way to win dear names o’er
which the Youthful One grows great.  
The Mighty and Far-seeing One hath mounted now the mighty Sūrya's car
which moves to every side.  
2 The Speaker, unassailable Master of this hymn, the Tongue of sacrifice
pours forth the pleasant meath.  
Within the lustrous region of the heavens the Son makes the third secret
name of Mother and of Sire.  
3 Sending forth flashes he hath bellowed to the jars, led by the men
into the golden reservoir.  
The milky streams of sacrifice have sung to him: he of the triple height
shines brightly through the morns.  
4 Pressed by the stones, with hymns, and graciously inclined,
illuminating both the Parents, Heaven and Earth,  
He flows in ordered season onward through the flee, a current of sweet
juice still swelling day by day.  
5 Flow onward, Soma, flow to bring prosperity: cleansed by the men,
invest thee with the milky draught.  
What gladdening drinks thou hast, foaming, exceeding strong, even with
these incite Indra to give us wealth.
