### HYMN III. Soma Pavamana.

1\. HERE present this Immortal God flies, like a bird upon her wings,  
To settle in the vats of wood.  
2 This God, made ready with the hymn, runs swiftly through the winding
ways,  
Inviolable as he flows.  
3 This God while flowing is adorned, like a bay steed for war, by men  
Devout and skilled in holy songs.  
4 He, like a warrior going forth with heroes, as he flows along  
Is fain to win all precious boons.  
5 This God, as he is flowing on, speeds like a car and gives his
gifts:  
He lets his voice be heard of all  
6 Praised by the sacred bards, this God dives into waters, and bestows  
Rich gifts upon the worshipper.  
7 Away he rushes with his stream, across the regions, into heaven,  
And roars as he is flowing on.  
8 While flowing, meet for sacrifice, he hath gone up to heaven across  
The regions, irresistible.  
9 After the 'way of ancient time, this God, pressed out for Deities,  
Flows tawny to the straining-cloth.  
10 This Lord of many Holy Laws, even at his birth engendering
strength,  
Effused, flows onward in a stream.
