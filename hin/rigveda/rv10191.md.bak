### HYMN CXCI. Agni.

1\. THOU, mighty Agni, gatherest up all that is precious for thy
friend.  
Bring us all treasures as thou art enkindled in libation's place  
2 Assemble, speak together: let your minds be all of one accord,  
As ancient Gods unanimous sit down to their appointed share.  
3 The place is common, common the assembly, common the mind, so be their
thought united.  
A common purpose do I lay before you, and worship with your general
oblation.  
4 One and the same be your resolve, and be your minds of one accord.  
United be the thoughts of all that all may happily agree.
