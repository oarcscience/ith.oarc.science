### HYMN LXI. Agni.

1\. PREPARE oblation: let him come; and let the minister serve again  
Who knows the ordering thereof,  
2 Rejoicing in his friendship, let the priest be seated over man,  
Beside the shoot of active power.  
3 Him, glowing bright beyond all thought, they seek among the race of
man;  
With him for [tongue](errata.htm#24.md) they seize the food.  
4 He hath inflamed the twofold plain: life-giving, he hath climbed the
wood,  
And with his tongue hath struck the rock.  
5 Wandering here the radiant Calf finds none to fetter him, and seeks  
The Mother to declare his praise.  
6 And now that great and mighty team, the team of horses that are his,  
And traces of his car, are seen.  
7 The seven milk a single cow; the two set other five to work,  
On the stream's loud-resounding bank.  
8 Entreated by Vivasvān's ten, Indra cast down the water-jar  
With threefold hammer from the sky.  
9 Three times the newly-kindled flame proceeds around the sacrifice:  
The priests anoint it with the meath.  
10 With reverence they drain the fount that circles with its wheel
above,  
Exhaustless, with the mouth below.  
11 The pressing-stones are set at work: the meath is poured into the
tank,  
At the out-shedding of the fount.  
12 Ye cows, protect the fount: the two Mighty Ones bless the
sacrifice.  
The handles twain are wrought of gold.  
13 Pour on the juice the ornament which reaches both the heaven and
earth  
Supply the liquid to the Bull.  
14 These know their own abiding-place: like calves beside the mother
cows  
They meet together with their kin.  
15 Devouring in their greedy jaws, they make sustaining food in
heaven,  
To Indra, Agni light and prayer.  
16 The Pious One milked out rich food, sustenance dealt in portions
seven,  
Together with the Sun's seven rays.  
17 I took some Soma when the Sun rose up, O Mitra, Varuṇa.  
That is the sick man's medicine.  
18 From where oblations must be laid, which is the Well-beloved's
home,  
He with his tongue hath compassed heaven.
