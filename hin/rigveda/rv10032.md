### HYMN XXXII. Indra.

1\. FORTH speed the Pair to bring the meditating God, benevolent with
boons sent in return for boons.  
May Indra graciously accept both gifts from us, when he hath knowledge
of the flowing Soma juice.  
2 Thou wanderest far, O Indra, through the spheres of light and realms
of earth, the region, thou whom many praise!  
Let those who often bring their solemn rites conquer the noisy babblers
who present no gifts.  
3 More beautiful than beauty must this seem to me, when the son duly
careth for his parents' line.  
The wife attracts the husband: with a shout of joy the man's auspicious
marriage is performed aright.  
4 This beauteous place of meeting have I looked upon, where, like
milch-cows, the kine order the marriage train;  
Where the Herd's Mother counts as first and best of all, and round her
are the seven-toned people of the choir.  
5 The Pious One hath reached your place before the rest: One only moves
victorious with the Rudras' band.  
To these your helpers pour our meath, Immortal Gods, with whom your song
of praise hath power to win their gifts.  
6 He who maintains the Laws of God informed me that thou wast lying
hidden in the waters.  
Indra, who knoweth well, beheld and showed thee. By him instructed am I
come, O Agni.  
7 The stranger asks the way of him who knows it: taught by the skilful
guide he travels onward.  
This is, in truth, the blessing of instruction: he finds the path that
leads directly forward.  
8 Even now he breathed: these days hath he remembered. Concealed, he
sucked the bosom of his Mother.  
Yet in his youth old age hath come upon him: he hath grown gracious,
good, and free from anger.  
9 O Kalasa, all these blessings will we bring them, O Kurusravana, who
give rich presents.  
May he, O wealthy princes, and this Soma which I am bearing in my heart,
reward you.
