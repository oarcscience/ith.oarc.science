### HYMN XXXVI Various Gods.

1\. WATER and milk hath he endued, sent forth to thee: the men have
drained him with the filters and the stones.  
Drink, Indra, from the Hotar's bowl—first right is thine—Soma hallowed
and poured with Vaṣaṭ and Svāhā.  
2 Busied with sacrifice, with spotted deer and spears, gleaming upon
your way with ornaments, yea, our Friends,  
Sitting on sacred grass, ye Sons of Bhārata, drink Soma from the Potar's
bowl, O Men of heaven.  
3 Come unto us, ye swift to listen: as at home upon the sacred grass sit
and enjoy yourselves.  
And, Tvaṣṭar, well-content be joyful in the juice with Gods and
Goddesses in gladsome company.  
4 Bring the Gods hither, Sage, and offer sacrifice: at the three altars
seat thee willingly, O Priest.  
Accept for thy delight the proffered Soma meath: drink from the
Kindler's bowl and fill thee with thy share.  
5 This is the strengthener of thy body's manly might: strength, victory
for all time are placed within thine arms.  
Pressed for thee, Maghavan, it is offered unto thee: drink from the
chalice of this Brahman, drink thy fill.  
6 Accept the sacrifice; mark both of you, my call: the Priest hath
seated him after the ancient texts.  
My prayer that bids them come goes forth to both the Kings: drink ye the
Soma meath from the Director's bowl.
