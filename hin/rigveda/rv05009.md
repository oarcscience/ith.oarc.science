### HYMN IX. Agni.

1\. BEARING; oblations mortal men, O Agni, worship thee the God.  
I deem thee Jātavedas: bear our offerings, thou, unceasingly.  
2 In the man's home who offers gifts, where grass is trimmed, Agni is
Priest,  
To whom all sacrifices come and strengthenings that win renown.  
3 Whom, as an infant newly-born, the kindling-sticks have brought to
life,  
Sustainer of the tribes of men, skilled in well-ordered sacrifice.  
4 Yea, very hard art thou to grasp, like offspring of the wriggling
snakes,  
When thou consumest many woods like an ox, Agni, in the mead.  
5 Whose flames, when thou art sending forth the smoke, completely reach
the mark,  
When Tṛta in the height of heaven, like as a smelter fanneth thee, e’en
as a smelter sharpeneth thee.  
6 O Agni, by thy succour and by Mitra's friendly furtherance,  
May we, averting hate, [subdue](errata.htm#17) the wickedness of mortal
men.  
7 O Agni, to our heroes bring such riches, thou victorious God.  
May he protect and nourish us, and help in gaining strength: be thou
near us in fight for our success.
