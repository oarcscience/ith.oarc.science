### HYMN XLV. Agni.

1 WORSHIP the Vasus, Agni! here, the Rudras, the Ādityas, all  
Who spring from Manu, those who know fair rites, who pour their
blessings down.  
2 Agni, the Gods who understand give ear unto the worshipper:  
Lord of Red Steeds, who lovest song, bring thou those Three-and-Thirty
Gods.  
3 O Jātavedas, great in act, hearken thou to Praskaṇva's call,  
As Priyamedha erst was heard, Atri, Virūpa, Aṅgiras.  
4 The sons of Priyamedha skilled in lofty praise have called for help  
On Agni who with fulgent flame is Ruler of all holy rites.  
5 Hear thou, invoked with holy oil, bountiful giver of rewards,  
These eulogies, whereby the sons of Kaṇva call thee to their aid.  
6 O Agni, loved by many, thou of fame most wondrous, in their homes  
Men call on thee whose hair is flame, to be the bearer of their gifts.  
7 Thee, Agni, best to find out wealth, most widely famous, quick to
hear,  
Singers have stablished in their rites Herald and ministering Priest.  
8 Singers with Soma pressed have made thee, Agni, hasten to the feast,  
Great light to mortal worshipper, what time they bring the sacred
gift.  
9 Good, bounteous, Son of Strength, this day seat here on sacred grass
the Gods  
Who come at early morn, the host of heaven, to drink the Soma juice  
10 Bring with joint invocations thou, O Agni, the celestial host:  
Here stands the Soma, bounteous Gods drink this expressed ere yesterday.
