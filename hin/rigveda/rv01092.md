### HYMN XCII. Dawn.

1\. THESE Dawns have raised their banner; in the eastern half of the
mid-air they spread abroad their shining light.  
Like heroes who prepare their weapons for the war, onward they come
bright red in hue, the Mother Cows.  
2 Readily have the purple beams of light shot up; the Red Cows have they
harnessed, easy to be yoked.  
The Dawns have brought distinct perception as before: red-hued, they
have attained their fulgent brilliancy.  
3 They sing their song like women active in their tasks, along their
common path hither from far away,  
Bringing refreshment to the liberal devotee, yea, all things to the
worshipper who pours the juice.  
4 She, like a dancer, puts her broidered garments on: as a cow yields
her udder so she bares her breast.  
Creating light for all the world of life, the Dawn hath laid the
darkness open as the cows their stall.  
5 We have beheld the brightness of her shining; it spreads and drives
away the darksome monster.  
Like tints that deck the Post at sacrifices, Heaven's Daughter hath
attained her wondrous splendour.  
6 We have o’erpast the limit of this darkness; Dawn breaking forth again
brings clear perception.  
She like a flatterer smiles in light for glory, and fair of face hath
wakened to rejoice us.  
7 The Gotamas have praised Heaven's radiant Daughter, the leader of the
charm of pleasant voices.  
Dawn, thou conferrest on us strength with offspring and men, conspicuous
with kine and horses.  
8 O thou who shinest forth in wondrous glory, urged onward by thy
strength, auspicious Lady,  
Dawn, may I gain that wealth, renowned and ample, in brave sons, troops
of slaves, far-famed for horses.  
9 Bending her looks on all the world, the Goddess shines, widely
spreading with her bright eye westward.  
Waking to motion every living creature, she understands the voice of
each adorer.  
10 Ancient of days, again again born newly, decking her beauty with the
self-same raiment.  
The Goddess wastes away the life of mortals, like a skilled hunter
cutting birds in pieces.  
11 She hath appeared discovering heaven's borders: to the far distance
she drives off her Sister.  
Diminishing the days of human creatures, the Lady shines with all her
lover's splendour.  
12 The bright, the blessed One shines forth extending her rays like
kine, as a flood rolls his waters.  
Never transgressing the divine commandments, she is beheld visible with
the sunbeams.  
13 O Dawn enriched with ample wealth, bestow on us the wondrous gift  
Wherewith we may support children and children's sons.  
14 Thou radiant mover of sweet sounds, with wealth of horses and of
kine  
Shine thou on us this day, O Dawn auspiciously.  
15 O Dawn enriched with holy rites, yoke to thy car thy purple steeds,  
And then bring thou unto us all felicities.  
16 O Aśvins wonderful in act, do ye unanimous direct  
Your chariot to our home wealthy in kine and gold.  
17 Ye who brought down the hymn from heaven, a light that giveth light
to man,  
Do ye, O Aśvins, bring strength hither unto us.  
18 Hither may they who wake at dawn bring, to drink Soma both the Gods  
Health-givers Wonder-Workers, borne on paths of gold.
