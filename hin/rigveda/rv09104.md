### HYMN CIV. Soma Pavamana.

1\. SIT down, O friends, and sing aloud to him who purifies himself:  
Deck him for glory, like a child, with holy rites.  
2 Unite him bringing household wealth, even as a calf, with mother
kine,  
Him who hath double strength, the God, delighting juice.  
3 Purify him who gives us power, that he, most Blessed One, may be  
A banquet for the Troop, Mitra, and Varuṇa.  
4 Voices have sung aloud to thee as finderout of wealth for us:  
We clothe the hue thou wearest with a robe of milk.  
5 Thou, Indu, art the food of Gods, O Sovran of all gladdening drinks:  
As Friend for friend, be thou best finder of success.  
6 Drive utterly away from us each demon, each voracious fiend,  
The godless and the false: keep sorrow far away.
