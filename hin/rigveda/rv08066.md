### HYMN LXVI. Indra.

1\. SCARCELY was Śatakratu, born when of his Mother he inquired,  
Who are the mighty? Who are famed?  
2. Then Śavasī declared to him Aurṇavābha, Ahīśuva:  
Son, these be they thou must o’erthrow  
3 The Vṛtra-slayer smote them all as spokes are hammered into naves:  
The Dasyu-killer waxed in might.  
4 Then Indra at a single draught drank the contents of thirty pails,  
Pails that were filled with Soma juice.  
5 Indra in groundless realms of space pierced the Gandharva through,
that he  
Might make Brahmans' strength increase.  
6 Down from the mountains Indra shot hither his well-directed shaft:  
He gained the ready brew of rice.  
7 One only is that shaft of thine, with thousand feathers, hundred
barbs,  
Which, Indra, thou hast made thy friend.  
8 Strong as the Ṛbhus at thy birth, therewith to those who praise thee,
men,  
And women, bring thou food to eat.  
9 By thee these exploits were achieved, the mightiest deeds,
abundantly:  
Firm in thy heart thou settest them.  
10 All these things Viṣṇu brought, the Lord of ample stride whom thou
hadst sent-  
A hundred buffaloes, a brew of rice and milk: and Indra, slew the
ravening boar  
11 Most deadly is thy bow, successful, fashioned well: good is thine
arrow, decked with gold.  
Warlike and well equipped thine arms are, which increase sweetness for
him who drinks the sweet.
