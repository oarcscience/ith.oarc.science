### HYMN XXXV. Soma Pavamana.

1\. Pour forth on us abundant wealth, O Pavamana, with thy stream.  
Wherewith thou mayest find us light  
2 O Indu, swayer of the sea, shaker of all things, flow thou on,  
Bearer of wealth to us with might.  
3 With thee for Hero, Valiant One! may we subdue our enemies:  
Let what is precious flow to us.  
4 Indu arouses strength the Sage who strives for victory, winning
power,  
Discovering holy works and means.  
5 Mover of speech, we robe him with our songs as he is purified  
Soma, the Guardian of the folk;  
6 On whose way, Lord of Holy Law, most richi as he is purified.  
The people all have set their hearts.
