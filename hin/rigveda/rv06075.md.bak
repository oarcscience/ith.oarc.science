### HYMN LXXV. Weapons of War.

1\. THE warrior's look is like a thunderous rain-cloud's, when, armed
with mail, he seeks the lap of battle.  
Be thou victorious with unwounded body: so let the thickness of thy mail
protect thee.  
2 With Bow let us win kine, with Bow the battle, with Bow be victors in
our hot encounters.  
The Bow brings grief and sorrow to the foeman: armed with the Bow may we
subdue all regions.  
3 Close to his car, as fain to speak, She presses, holding her
well-loved Friend in her embraces.  
Strained on the Bow, She whispers like a woman-this Bowstring that
preserves us in the combat.  
4 These, meeting like a woman and her lover, bear, mother-like, their
child upon their bosom.  
May the two Bow-ends, starting swift asunder, scatter, in unison, the
foes who hate us.  
5 With many a son, father of many daughters, He clangs and clashes as he
goes to battle.  
Slung on the back, pouring his brood, the Quiver vanquishes all opposing
bands and armies.  
6 Upstanding in the Car the skilful Charioteer guides his strong Horses
on whithersoe’er he will.  
See and admire the strength of those controlling Reins which from behind
declare the will of him who drives.  
7 Horses whose hoofs rain dust are neighing loudly, yoked to the
Chariots, showing forth their vigour,  
With their forefeet descending on the foemen, they, never flinching,
trample and destroy them.  
8 Car-bearer is the name of his oblation, whercon are laid his Weapons
and his Armour.  
So let us here, each day that passes, honour the helpful Car with hearts
exceeding joyful.  
9 In sweet association lived the fathers who gave us life, profound and
strong in trouble,  
Unwearied, armed with shafts and wondrous weapons, free, real heroes,
conquerors of armies.  
10 The Brahmans, and the Fathers meet for Soma-draughts, and, graciously
inclined, unequalled Heaven and Earth.  
Guard us trom evil, Pūṣan, guard us strengtheners of Law: let not the
evil-wisher master us.  
11 Her tooth a deer, dressed in an eagle's feathers, bound with
cow-hide, launched forth, She flieth onward.  
There where the heroes speed hither and thither, there may the Arrows
shelter and protect us.  
12 Avoid us thou whose flight is straight, and let our bodies be as
stone.  
May Soma kindly speak to us, and Aditi protect us well.  
13 He lays his blows upon their backs, he deals his blows upon their
thighs.  
Thou, Whip, who urgest horses, drive sagacious horses in the fray.  
14 It compasses the arm with serpent windings, fending away the friction
of the bowstring:  
So may the Brace, well-skilled in all its duties, guard manfully the man
from every quarter.  
15 Now to the Shaft with venom smeared, tipped with deer-horn, with iron
mouth,  
Celestial, of Parjanya's seed, be this great adoration paid.  
16 Loosed from the Bowstring fly away, thou Arrow, sharpened by our
prayer.  
Go to the foemen, strike them home, and let not one be left alive.  
17 There where the flights of Arrows fall like boys whose locks are yet
unshorn.  
Even there may Brahmaṇaspati, and Aditi protect us well, protect us well
through all our days.  
18 Thy vital parts I cover with thine Armour: with immortality King Soma
clothe thee.  
Varuṇa give thee what is more than ample, and in thy triumph may the
Gods be joyful.  
19 Whoso would kill us, whether he be a strange foe or one of us,
