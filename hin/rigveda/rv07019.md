### HYMN XIX. Indra.

1\. HE like a bull with sharpened horns, terrific, singly excites and
agitates all the people:  
Thou givest him who largely pours libations his goods who pours not, for
his own possession.  
2 Thou, verily, Indra, gavest help to Kutsa, willingly giving car to him
in battle,  
When, aiding Ārjuneya, thou subduedst to him both Kuyava and the Dāsa
Śuṣṇa.  
3 O Bold One, thou with all thine aids hast boldly holpen Sudās whose
offerings were accepted,  
Pūru in winning land and slaying foemen, and Trasadasyu son of
Purukutsa.  
4 At the Gods’ banquet, hero-souled! with Heroes, Lord of Bay Steeds,
thou slewest many foemen.  
Thou sentest in swift death to sleep the Dasyu, both Cumuri and Dhuni,
for Dabhīti.  
5 These were thy mighty powers that, Thunder-wielder, thou swiftly
crushedst nine-and-ninety castles:  
Thou capturedst the hundredth in thine onslaught; thou slewest Namuci,
thou slewest Vṛtra.  
6 Old are the blessings, Indra, which thou gavest Sudās the worshipper
who brought oblations.  
For thee, the Strong, I yoke thy strong Bay Horses: may our prayers
reach thee and win strength, Most Mighty!  
7 Give us not up, Lord of Bay Horses, Victor, in this thine own
assembly, to the wicked.  
Deliver us with true and faithful succours: dear may we be to thee among
the princes.  
8 May we men, Maghavan, the friends thou lovest, near thee be joyful
under thy protection.  
Fain to fulfil the wish of Atithigva humble. the pride of Turvaśa and
Yadva.  
9 Swiftly, in truth, O Maghavan, about thee men skilled in hymning sing
their songs and praises. '  
Elect us also into their assembly who by their calls on thee despoiled
the niggards.  
10 Thine are these lauds, O manliest of heroes, lauds which revert to us
and give us riches.  
Favour these, Indra, when they fight with faemen, as Friend and Hero and
the heroes' Helper.  
11 Now, lauded for thine aid, Heroic Indra, sped by our prayer, wax
mighty in thy body.  
Apportion to us strength and habitations. Ye Gods, protect us evermore
with blessings.
