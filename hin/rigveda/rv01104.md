### HYMN CIV. Indra.

1\. THE altar hath been made for thee to rest on: come like a panting
courser and be seated.  
Loosen thy flying Steeds, set free thy Horses who bear thee swiftly nigh
at eve and morning.  
2 These men have come to Indra for assistance: shall he not quickly come
upon these pathways?  
May the Gods quell the fury of the Dāsa, and may they lead our folk to
happy fortune.  
3 He who hath only wish as his possession casts on himself, casts foam
amid the waters.  
Both wives of Kuyava in milk have bathed them: may they be drowned
within the depth of Śiphā.  
4 This hath his kinship checked who lives beside us: with ancient
streams forth speeds and rules the Hero,  
Añjasī, Kuliśī, and Virapatnī, delighting him, bear milk upon their
waters.  
5 Soon as this Dasyu's traces were discovered, as she who knows her
home, he sought the dwelling.  
Now think thou of us, Maghavan, nor cast us away as doth a profligate
his treasure.  
6 Indra, as such, give us a share of sunlight, of waters, sinlessness,
and reputation.  
Do thou no harm to our yet unborn offspring: our trust is in thy mighty
Indra-power.  
7 Now we, I think, in thee as such have trusted: lead us on, Mighty One,
to ample riches.  
In no unready house give us, O Indra invoked of many, food and drink
when hungry.  
8 Slay us not, Indra; do not thou forsake us: steal not away the joys
which we delight in.  
Rend not our unborn brood, strong Lord of Bounty! our vessels with the
life that is within them.  
9 Come to us; they have called thee Soma-lover: here is the pressed
juice. Drink thereof for rapture.  
Widely-capacious, pour it down within thee, and, invocated, hear us like
a Father.
