### HYMN XLII Viśvedevas.

1\. LET Brahmans and Aṅgirases come forward, and let the roar of cloudy
heaven surround us.  
Loud low the Milch-kine swimming in the waters: set be the stones that
grace our holy service.  
2 Fair, Agni, is thy long-known path to travel: yoke for the juice tfiy
bay, thy ruddy horses,  
Or red steeds, Hero-bearing, for the chamber. Seated, I call the
Deities' generations.  
3 They glorify your sacrifice with worship, yet the glad Priest near
them is left unequalled.  
Bring the Gods hither, thou of many aspects: turn hitherward Aramati the
Holy.  
4 What time the Guest hath made himself apparent, at ease reclining in
the rich man's dwelling,  
Agni, well-pleased, well-placed within the chamber gives to a house like
this wealth worth the choosing.  
5 Accept this sacrifice of ours, O Agni; glorify it with Indra and the
Maruts.  
Here on our grass let Night and Dawn be seated: bring longing Varuṇa and
Mitra hither.  
6 Thus hath Vasiṣṭha praised victorious Agni, yearning for wealth that
giveth all subsistence.  
May he bestow on us food, strength, and riches. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
