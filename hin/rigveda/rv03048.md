### HYMN XLVIII. Indra.

1\. SOON as the young Bull sprang into existence he longed to taste the
pressed-out Soma's liquor.  
Drink thou thy fill, according to thy longing, first, of the goodly
mixture blent with Soma.  
2 That day when thou wast born thou, fain to taste it, drankest the
plant's milk which the mountains nourish.  
That milk thy Mother first, the Dame who bare thee, poured for thee in
thy mighty Father's dwelling.  
3 Desiring food he came unto his Mother, and on her breast beheld the
pungent Soma.  
Wise, he moved on, keeping aloof the others, and wrought great exploits
in his varied aspects.  
4 Fierce, quickly conquering, of surpassing vigour, he framed his body
even as he listed.  
E’en from his birth-time Indra conquered Tvaṣṭar, bore off the Soma and
in beakers drank it.  
5 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where
spoil is gathered;  
The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras,
wins and gathers riches.
