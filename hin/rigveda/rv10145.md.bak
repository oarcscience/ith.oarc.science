### HYMN CXLV. Sapatnibadhanam.

1\. FROM out the earth I dig this plant, a herb of most effectual
power,  
Wherewith one quells the rival wife and gains the husband for oneself.  
2 Auspicious, with expanded leaves, sent by the Gods, victorious
plant,  
Blow thou the rival wife away, and make my husband only mine.  
3 Stronger am 1, O Stronger One, yea, mightier than the mightier;  
And she who is my rival wife is lower than the lowest dames.  
4 Her very name I utter not: she takes no pleasure in this man.  
Far into distance most remote drive we the rival wife away.  
5 I am the conqueror, and thou, thou also act victorious:  
As victory attends us both we will subdue my fellow-wife.  
6 I have gained thee for vanquisher, have grasped thee with a stronger
spell.  
As a cow hastens to her calf, so let thy spirit speed te me, hasten like
water on its way.
