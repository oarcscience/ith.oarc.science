### HYMN LXVII. Aśvins.

1\. I WITH a holy heart that brings oblation will sing forth praise to
meet your car, ye Princes,  
Which, Much-desired! hath wakened as your envoy. I call you hither as a
son his parents.  
2 Brightly hath Agni shone by us enkindled: the limits even of darkness
were apparent.  
Eastward is seen the Banner of the Morning, the Banner born to give
Heaven's Daughter glory.  
3 With hymns the deft priest is about you, Aśvins, the eloquent priest
attends you now, Nāsatyas.  
Come by the paths that ye are wont to travel, on car that finds the
light, laden with treasure.  
4 When, suppliant for your help, Lovers of Sweetness! I seeking wealth
call you to our libation,  
Hitherward let your vigorous horses bear you: drink ye with us the
well-pressed Soma juices.  
5 Bring forward, Aśvins, Gods, to its fulfilment my never-wearied prayer
that asks for riches.  
Vouchsafe us all high spirit in the combat, and with your powers, O
Lords of Power, assist us.  
6 Favour us in these prayers of ours, O Aśvins. May we have genial
vigour, ne’er to fail us.  
So may we, strong in children and descendants, go, wealthy, to the
banquet that awaits you.  
7 Lovers of Sweetness, we have brought this treasure to you as ’twere an
envoy sent for friendship.  
Come unto us with spirits free from anger, in homes of men enjoying our
oblation.  
8 With one, the same, intention, ye swift movers, o’er the Seven Rivers
hath your chariot travelled.  
Yoked by the Gods, your strong steeds never weary while speeding forward
at the pole they bear you.  
9 Exhaustless be your bounty to our princes who with their wealth incite
the gift of riches,  
Who further friendship with their noble natures, combining wealth in
kine with wealth in herses.  
10 Now hear, O Youthful Twain, mine invocation: come, Aśvins, to the
home where food aboundeth.  
Vouchsafe us wealth, do honour to our nobles. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
