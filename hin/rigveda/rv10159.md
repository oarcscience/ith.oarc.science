### HYMN CLIX. Saci Paulomi.

1\. YON Sun hath mounted up, and this my happy fate hate mounted high.  
I knowing this, as conqueror have won my husband for mine own.  
2 I am the banner and the head, a mighty arbitress am I:  
I am victorious, and my Lord shall be submissive to my will.  
3 My Sons are slayers of the foe, my Daughter is a ruling Queen:  
I am victorious: o’er my Lord my song of triumph is supreme.  
4 Oblation, that which Indra gave and thus grew glorious and most
high,—  
This have I offered, O ye Gods, and rid me of each rival wife.  
5 Destroyer of the rival wife, Sole Spouse, victorious, conqueror,  
The others' glory have I seized as ’twere the wealth of weaker Dames.  
6 I have subdued as conqueror these rivals, these my fellow-wives,  
That I may hold imperial sway over this Hero and the folk.
