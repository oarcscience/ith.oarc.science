### HYMN CIX. Viśvedevas.

1\. THESE first, the boundless Sea, and Mātariśvan, fierce-glowing Fire,
the Strong, the Bliss-bestower.  
And heavenly Floods, first-born by holy Order, exclaimed against the
outrage on a Brahman.  
2 King Soma first of all, without reluctance, made restitution of the
Brahman's consort.  
Mitra and Varuṇa were the inviters: Agni as Hota; took her hand and led
her.  
3 The man, her pledge, must by her hand be taken when they have cried,
She is a Brahman's consort.  
She stayed not for a herald to conduct her: thus is the kingdom of a
ruler guarded.  
4 Thus spake of her those Gods of old, Seven Ṛṣis who sate them down to
their austere devotion:  
Dire is a Brahman's wife led home by others: in the supremest heaven she
plants confusion.  
5 The Brahmacari goes engaged in duty: he is a member of the Gods’ own
body.  
Through him Bṛhaspati obtained his consort, as the Gods gained the ladle
brought by Soma.  
6 So then the Gods restored her, so men gave the woman back again.  
The Kings who kept their promises restored the Brahman's wedded wife,  
7 Having restored the Brahman's wife, and freed them, with Gods’ aid,
from sin,  
They shared the fulness of the earth, and won themselves extended sway.
