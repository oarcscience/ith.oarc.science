Heritage

### HYMN LXXIX. Indra.

1\. MAY Indra, who in every fight must be invoked, be near to us.  
May the most mighty Vṛtra-slayer, meet for praise, come to libations and
to hymns.  
2 Thou art the best of all in sending bounteous gifts, true art thou,
lordly in thine act.  
We claim alliance with the very Glorious One, yea, with the Mighty Son
of Strength.  
3 Prayers unsurpassed are offered up to thee the Lover of the Song.  
Indra, Lord of Bay Steeds, accept these fitting hymns, hymns which we
have thought out for thee.  
4 For thou, O Maghavan, art truthful, ne’er subdued and bringest many a
Vṛtra low.  
As such, O Mightiest Lord, Wielder of Thunder, send wealth hither to the
worshipper.  
5 O Indra, thou art far-renowned, impetuous, O Lord of Strength.  
Alone thou slayest with the guardian of mankind resistless
never-conquered foes.  
6 As such we seek thee now, O Asura, thee most wise, craving thy bounty
as our share.  
Thy sheltering defence is like a mighty cloak. So may thy glories reach
to us.
