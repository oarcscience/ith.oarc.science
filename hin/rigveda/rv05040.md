Heritage

### HYMN XL. Indra. Sūrya. Atri.

1\. COME thou to what the stones have pressed, drink Soma, O thou Soma's
Lord,  
Indra best Vṛtra-slayer Strong One, with the Strong.  
2 Strong is the stone, the draught is strong, strong is this Soma that
is pressed,  
Indra, best Vṛtra-slayer, Strong One with the Strong.  
3 As strong I call on thee the Strong, O Thunder-armed, with various
aids,  
Indra, best Vṛtra-slayer, Strong One with the Strong.  
4 Impetuous, Thunderer, Strong, quelling the mighty, King, potent,
Vṛtra-slayer, Soma-drinker,  
May he come hither with his yoked Bay Horses; may Indra gladden him at
the noon libation.  
5 O Sūrya, when the Asura's descendant Svarbhanu, pierced thee through
and through with darkness,  
All creatures looked like one who is bewildered, who knoweth not the
place where he is standing.  
6 What time thou smotest down Svarbhanu's magic that spread itself
beneath the sky, O Indra,  
By his fourth sacred prayer Atri disoovered Sūrya concealed in gloom
that stayed his function.  
7 Let not the oppressor with this dread, through anger swallow me up,
for I am thine, O Atri.  
Mitra art thou, the sender of true blessings: thou and King Varuṇa be
both my helpers.  
8 The Brahman Atri, as he set the press-stones, serving the Gods with
praise and adoration,  
Established in the heaven the eye of Sūrya, and caused Svarbhanu's magic
arts to vanish.  
9 The Atris found the Sun again, him whom Svarbhanu of the brood  
Of Asuras had pierced with gloom. This none besides had power to do.
