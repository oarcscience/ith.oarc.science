### HYMN LXXXII. Indra.

1\. SURYA, thou mountest up to meet the Hero famous for his wealth,  
Who hurls the bolt and works for man  
2 Him who with might of both his arms brake nine-and-ninety castles
down,  
Slew Vṛtra and smote Ahi dead.  
3 This Indra is our gracious Friend. He sends us in a full broad
stream  
Riches in horses, kine, and corn.  
4 Whatever, Vṛtra-slayer! thou, Sūrya, hast risen upon to-day,  
Tbat, Indra, all is in thy power.  
5 When, Mighty One, Lord of the brave, thou thinkest thus, I shall not
die,  
That thought of thine is true indeed.  
6 Thou, Indra, goest unto all Soma libations shed for thee,  
Both far away and near at hand.  
7 We make this Indra very strong to strike the mighty Vṛtra dead:  
A vigorous Hero shall he be.  
8 Indra was made for giving, set, most mighty, o’er the joyous
draught.  
Bright, meet for Soma, famed in song.  
9 By song as ’twere, the powerful bolt which none may parry was
prepared  
Lofty, invincible he grew.  
10 Indra, Song-lover, lauded, make even in the wilds fair ways for us,  
Whenever, Maghavan, thou wilt.  
11 Thou whose commandment and behest of sovran sway none disregards,  
Neither audacious man nor God.  
12 And both these Goddesses, Earth, Heaven, Lord of the beauteous helm!
revere  
Thy might which no one may resist.  
13 Thou in the black cows and the red and in the cows with spotted
skin  
This white milk hast deposited.  
14 When in their terror all the Gods shrank from the Dragon's furious
might,  
Fear of the monster fell on them.  
15 Then he was my Defender, then, Invincible, whose foe is not,  
The Vṛtra-slayer showed his might.  
16 Him your best Vṛtra-slayer, him the famous Champion of mankind  
I urge to great munificence,  
17 To come, Much-lauded! Many-named with this same thought that longs
for milk,  
Whene’er the Soma juice is shed.  
18 Much-honoured by libations, may the Vṛtra-slayer wake for us:  
May Śakra listen to our prayers.  
19 O Hero, with that aid dost thou delight us, with what succour bring  
Riches to those who worship thee?  
20 With whose libation joys the Strong, the Hero with his team who
quells  
The foe, to drink the Soma juice?  
21 Rejoicing in thy spirit bring thousandfold opulence to us:  
Enrich thy votary with gifts.  
22 These juices with their wedded wives flow to enjoyment lovingly:  
To waters speeds the restless one.  
23 Presented strengthening gifts have sent Indra away at sacrifice,  
With might, onto the cleansing bath.  
24 These two who share his feast, Bay Steeds with golden manes, shall
bring him to  
The banquet that is laid for him.  
25 For thee, O Lord of Light, are shed these Soma-drops, and grass is
strewn  
Bring Indra to his worshippers.  
26 May Indra give thee skill, and lights of heaven, wealth to his
votary  
And priests who praise him: laud ye him.  
27 O Śatakratu, wondrous strength and all our lauds I bring to thee:  
Be gracious to thy worshippers.  
28 Bring to us all things excellent, O Śatakratu, food and strength:  
For, Indra, thou art kind to us.  
2§ O Śatakratu, bring to us all blessings, all felicity:  
Fbr, Indra, thou art kind to us.  
30 Bearing the Soma juice we call, best Vṛtra-slayer, unto thee:  
For, Indra, thou art kind to us.  
31 Come, Lord of rapturous, joys, to our libation with thy Bay Steeds,
come  
To our libation with thy Steeds.  
32 Known as best Vṛtra-slayer erst, as Indra Śatakratu, come  
With Bay Steeds to the juice we shed.  
33 O Vṛtra-slayer, thou art he who drinks these drops of Soma: come  
With Bay Steeds to the juice we shed.  
34 May Indra give, to aid us, wealth handy that rules the Skilful
Ones:  
Yea, may the Strong give potent wealth.
