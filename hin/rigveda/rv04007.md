### HYMN VII. Agni.

1\. HERE by ordainers was this God appointed first Invoker, best at
worship, to be praised at rites:  
Whom Apnavāna, and the Bhṛgus caused to shine bright-coloured in the
wood, spreading from home to home.  
2 When shall thy glory as a God, Agni, be suddenly shown forth.  
For mortal men have held thee fast, adorable in all their homes,  
3 Seeing thee faithful to the Law, most sapient, like the starry
heaven,  
Illumining with cheerful ray each solemn rite in every house.  
4 Vivasvān's envoy living men have taken as their ensign, swift,  
The ruler over all mankind, moving like Bhṛgu in each home.  
5 Him the intelligent have they placed duly as Invoking Priest,  
Welcome, with sanctifying flame, best worshipper, with sevenfold
might;  
6 In his Eternal Mothers, in the wood, concealed and unapproached,  
Kept secret though his flames are bright seeking on all sides, quickly
found.  
7 That as food spreads forth in this earthly udder, Gods may rejoice
them in the home of Order,  
Great Agni, served with reverence and oblation, flies ever to the
sacrifice, the Faithful.  
8 Bird of each rite, skilled in an envoy's duties, knowing both worlds
and that which lies between them,  
Thou goest from of old a willing Herald, knowing full well heaven's
innermost recesses.  
9 Bright God, thy path is black: light is before thee: thy moving
splendour is the chief of wonders.  
When she, yet unimpregnate, hath conceived thee, even when newly born
thou art an envoy.  
10 Yet newly born, his vigour is apparent when the wind blows upon his
fiery splendour,  
His sharpened tongue he layeth on the brushwood, and with his teeth e’en
solid food consumeth.  
11 When he hath borne off food with swift flame swiftly, strong Agni
makes himself a speedy envoy,  
Follows the rustling of the wind, consuming, and courser-like, speeds,
drives the swift horse onward.
