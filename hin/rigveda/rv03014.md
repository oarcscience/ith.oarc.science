### HYMN XIV. Agni.

1 THE pleasant Priest is come into the synod, true, skilled in
sacrifice, most wise, Ordainer.  
Agni, the Son of Strength, whose car is lightning, whose hair is flame,
hath shown on earth his lustre.  
2 To thee I offer reverent speech: accept it: to thee who markest it,
victorious, faithful!  
Bring, thou who knowest, those who know, and seat thee amid the sacred
grass, for help, O Holy.  
3 The Two who show their vigour, Night and Morning, by the wind's paths
shall haste to thee O Agni.  
When men adorn the Ancient with oblations, these seek, as on two
chariot-seats, the dwelling.  
4 To thee, strong Agni! Varuṇa and Mitra and all the Maruts sang a song
of triumph,  
What time unto the people's lands thou camest, spreading them as the Sun
of men, with lustre.  
5 Approaching with raised hands and adoration, we have this day
fulfilled for thee thy longing.  
Worship the Gods with most devoted spirit, a Priest with no unfriendly
thought, O Agni.  
6 For, Son of Strength, from thee come many succours, and powers
abundant that a God possesses.  
Agni, to us with speech that hath no falsehood grant riches, real, to be
told in thousands.  
7 Whatever, God, in sacrifice we mortals have wrought is all for thee,
strong, wise of purpose!  
Be thou the Friend of each good chariot's master. All this enjoy thou
here, immortal Agni.
