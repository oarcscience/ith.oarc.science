### HYMN XLI. Indra-Varuṇa.

1\. WHAT laud, O Indra-Varuṇa, with oblation, hath like the Immortal
Priest obtained your favour?  
Hath our effectual laud, addressed with homage, touched you, O
Indra-Varuṇa, in spirit?  
2 He who with dainty food hath won you, Indra and Varuṇa, Gods, as his
allies to friendship,  
Slayeth the Vṛtras and his foes in battles, and through your mighty
favours is made famous.  
3 Indra and Varuṇa are most liberal givers of treasure to the men who
toil to serve them,  
When they, as Friends inclined to friendship, honoured with dainty food,
delight in flowing Soma.  
4 Indra and Varuṇa, ye hurl, O Mighty, on him your strongest flashing
bolt of thunder  
Who treats us ill, the robber and oppressor: measure on him your
overwhelming vigour.  
5 O Indra-Varuṇa, be ye the lovers of this my song, as steers who love
the milch-Cow.  
Milk may it yield us as, gone forth to pasture, the great Cow pouring
out her thousand rivers.  
6 For fertile fields, for worthy sons and grandsons, for the Sun's
beauty and for steer-like vigour,  
May Indra-Varuṇa with gracious favours work marvels for us in the stress
of battle.  
7 For you, as Princes, for your ancient kindness, good comrades of the
man who seeks for booty,  
We choose to us for the dear bond of friendship, most liberal Heroes
bringing bliss like parents.  
8 Showing their strength, these hymns for grace, Free-givers I have gone
to you, devoted, as to battle.  
For glory have they gone, as milk to Soma, to Indra-Varuṇa my thoughts
and praises.  
9 To Indra and to Varuṇa, desirous of gaining wealth have these my
thoughts proceeded.  
They have come nigh to you as treasure-lovers, like mares, fleet-footed,
eager for the glory.  
10 May we ourselves be lords of during riches, of ample sustenance for
car and hones.  
So may the Twain who work with newest succours bring yoked teams
hitherward to us and riches.  
11 Come with your mighty succours, O ye Mighty; come, Indra-Varuṇa, to
us in battle.  
What time the flashing arrows play in combat, may we through you be
winners in the contest.
