### HYMN CLXVIII. Vāyu.

1\. O THE Wind's chariot, O its power and glory! Crashing it goes and
hath a voice of thunder.  
It makes the regions red and touches heaven, and as it moves the dust of
earth is scattered.  
2 Along the traces of the Wind they hurry, they come to him as dames to
an assembly.  
Borne on his car with these for his attendants, the God speeds forth,
the universe's Monarch.  
3 Travelling on the paths of air's mid-region, no single day doth he
take rest or slumber.  
Holy and earliest-born, Friend of the waters, where did he spring and
from what region came he?  
4 Germ of the world, the Deities’ vital spirit, this God moves ever as
his will inclines him.  
His voice is heard, his shape is ever viewless. Let us adore this Wind
with our oblation.
