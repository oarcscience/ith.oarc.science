### HYMN VI. Agni.

1\. AGNI, accept this flaming brand, this waiting with my prayer on
thee:  
Hear graciously these songs of praise.  
2 With this hymn let us honour thee, seeker of horses, Son of
Strength,  
With this fair hymn, thou nobly born.  
3 As such, lover of song, with songs, wealth-lover, giver of our
wealth!  
With reverence let us worship thee.  
4 Be thou for us a liberal Prince, giver and Lord of precious things.  
Drive those who hate us far away.  
5 Such as thou art, give rain from heaven, give strength which no man
may resist:  
Give food exceeding plentiful.  
6 To him who lauds thee, craving help, most youthful envoy! through our
song,  
Most holy Herald! come thou nigh.  
7 Between both races, Agni, Sage, well skilled thou passest to and
fro,  
As envoy friendly to mankind.  
8 Befriend us thou as knowing all. Sage, duly worship thou the Gods,  
And seat thee on this sacred grass.
