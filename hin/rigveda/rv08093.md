### HYMN I. Indra.

1\. TO you will I sing Indra's praise who gives good gifts as well we
know;  
The praise of Maghavan who, rich in treasure, aids his singers with
wealth thousandfold.  
2 As with a hundred hosts, he rushes boldly on, and for the offerer
slays his foes.  
As from a mountain flow the water-brooks, thus flow his gifts who
feedeth many a one.  
3 The drops effused, the gladdening draughts, O Indra, Lover of the
Son  
As waters seek the lake where they are wont to rest, fill thee, for
bounty, Thunderer.  
4 The matchless draught that strengthens and gives eloquence, the
sweetest of the meath drink thou,  
That in thy joy thou maysi scatter thy gifts o’er us, plenteously, even
as the dust.  
5 Come quickly to our laud, urged on by Soma-pressers like a horse-  
Laud, Godlike Indra, which milch-kine make sweet for thee: with Kaṇva's
sons are gifts for thee.  
6 With homage have we sought thee as a Hero, strong, preeminent, with
unfailing wealth.  
O Thunderer, as a plenteous spring pours forth its stream, so, Indra,
flow our songs to thee.  
7 If now thou art at sacrifice, or if thou art upon the earth,  
Come thence, high-thoughted! to our sacrifice with the Swift, come,
Mighty with the Mighty Ones.  
8 The active, fleet-foot, tawny Coursers that are thine are swift to
victory, like the Wind,  
Wherewith thou goest round to visit Manus' seed, wherewith all heaven is
visible.  
9 Indra, from thee so great we crave prosperity in wealth of kine,  
As, Maghavan, thou favouredst Medhyātithi, and, in the fight,
Nipatithi.  
10 As, Maghavan, to Kaṇva, Trasadasyu, and to Paktha and Dasavraja;  
As, Indra, to Gosarya and Ṛjiśvan, thou vouchsafedst wealth in kine and
gold.
