### HYMN CLXII. Agni

1\. MAY Agni, yielding to our prayer, the Rakṣas-slayer, drive away  
The malady of evil name that hath beset thy labouring womb.  
2 Agni, concurring in the prayer, drive off the eater of the flesh,  
The malady of evil name that hath attacked thy babe and womb.  
3 That which destroys the sinking germ, the settled, moving embryo,  
That which will kill the babe at birth,—even this will we drive far
away.  
4 That which divides thy legs that it may lie between the married
pair,  
That penetrates and licks thy side,—even this will we exterminate.  
5 What rests by thee in borrowed form of brother, lover, or of lord,  
And would destroy thy Progeny,—even this will we exterminate.  
6 That which through sleep or darkness hath deceived thee and lies down
by thee,  
And will destroy thy progeny,—even this will we exterminate.
