### HYMN XVIII. Indra.

1\. ALL is with thee, O Indra, all the treasures which erst our fathers
won who sang thy praises.  
With thee are milch-kine good to milk, and horses: best winner thou of
riches for the pious.  
2 For like a King among his wives thou dwellest: with glories, as a
Sage, surround and help us.  
Make us, thy servants, strong for wealth, and honour our songs wirth
kine and steeds and decoration.  
3 Here these our holy hymns with joy and gladness in pious emulation
have approached thee.  
Hitherward come thy path that leads to riches: may we find shelter in
thy favour, Indra.  
4 Vasiṣṭha hath poured forth his prayers, desiring to milk thee like a
cow in goodly pasture.  
All these my people call thee Lord of cattle: may Indra. come unto the
prayer we offer.  
5 What though the floods spread widely, Indra made them shallow and easy
for Sudās to traverse.  
He, worthy of our praises, caused the Simyu, foe of our hymn, to curse
the rivers' fury.  
6 Eager for spoil was Turvaśa Purodas, fain to win wealth, like fishes
urged by hunger.  
The Bhṛgus and the Druhyus quickly listened: friend rescued friend mid
the two distant peoples.  
7 Together came the Pakthas, the Bhalanas, the Alinas, the Sivas, the
Visanins.  
Yet to the Trtsus came the Ārya's Comrade, through love of spoil and
heroes' war, to lead them.  
8 Fools, in their folly fain to waste her waters, they parted
inexhaustible Paruṣṇī.  
Lord of the Earth, he with his might repressed them: still lay the herd
and the affrighted herdsman.  
9 As to their goal they sped to their destruetion: they sought Paruṣṇī;
e’en the swift returned not.  
Indra abandoned, to Sudās the manly, the swiftly flying foes, unmanly
babblers.  
10 They went like kine unherded from the pasture, each clinging to a
friend as chance directed.  
They who drive spotted steeds, sent down by Pṛśni, gave ear, the
Warriors and the harnessed horses.  
11 The King who scattered one-and-twenty people of both Vaikarna tribes
through lust of glory-  
As the skilled priest clips grass within the chamber, so hath the Hero
Indra, wrought their downfall.  
12 Thou, thunder-armed, o’erwhelmedst in the waters famed ancient Kavasa
and then the Druhyu.  
Others here claiming friendship to their friendship, devoted unto thee,
in thee were joyful.  
13 Indra at once with conquering might demolished all their strong
places and their seven castles.  
The goods of Anu's son he gave to Trtsu. May we in sacrifice conquer
scorned Pūru.  
14 The Anavas and Druhyus, seeking booty, have slept, the sixty hundred,
yea, six thousand,  
And six-and-sixty heroes. For the pious were all these mighty exploits
done by Indra.  
15 These Trtsus under Indra's careful guidance came speeding like loosed
waters rushing downward.  
The foemen, measuring exceeding closely, abandoned to Sudās all their
provisions.  
16 The hero's side who drank the dressed oblation, Indra's denier, far
o’er earth he scattered.  
Indra brought down the fierce destroyer's fury. He gave them various
roads, the path's Controller.  
17 E’en with the weak he wrought this matchless exploit: e’en with a
goat he did to death a lion.  
He pared the pillar's angles with a needle. Thus to Sudās Indra gave all
provisions.  
18 To thee have all thine enemies submitted: e’en the fierce Bheda hast
thou made thy subject.  
Cast down thy sharpened thunderbolt, O Indra, on him who harms the men
who sing thy praises.  
19 Yamuna and the Trtsus aided Indra. There he stripped Bheda bare of
all his treasures.  
The Ajas and the Sigrus and the Yaksus brought in to him as tribute
heads of horses.  
20 Not to be scorned, but like Dawns past and recent, O Indra, are thy
favours and thy riches.  
Devaka, Mānyamana's son, thou slewest, and smotest Śambara from the
lofty mountain.  
21 They who, from home, have gladdened thee, thy servants Parasara,
Vasiṣṭha, Satayatu,  
Will not forget thy friendship, liberal Giver. So shall the days dawn
prosperous for the princes.  
22 Priest-like, with praise, I move around the altar, earning
Paijavana's reward, O Agni,  
Two hundred cows from Devavan's descendant, two chariots from Sudās with
mares to draw them.  
23 Gift of Paijavana, four horses bear me in foremost place, trained
steeds with pearl to deck them.  
Sudās's brown steeds, firmly-stepping, carry me and my son for progeny
and glory.  
24 Him whose fame spreads between wide earth and heaven, who, as
dispenser, gives each chief his portion,  
Seven flowing Rivers glorify like Indra. He slew Yudhyamadhi in close
encounter.  
25 Attend on him O ye heroic Maruts as on Sudās's father Divodāsa.  
Further Paijavana's desire with favour. Guard faithfully his lasting
firm dominion.
