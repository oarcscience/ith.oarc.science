### HYMN CXXXIX. Savitar.

1\. SAVITAR, golden-haired, hath lifted eastward, bright With the
sunbeams, his eternal lustre;  
He in whose energy wise Pūṣan marches, surveying all existence like a
herdsman.  
2 Beholding men he sits amid the heaven filling the two world-halves and
air's wide region.  
He looks upon the rich far-spreading pastures between the eastern and
the western limit.  
3 He, root of wealth, the gatherer-up of treasures, looks with his might
on every form and figure.  
Savitar, like a Godẉhose Law is constant, stands in the battle for the
spoil like Indra.  
4 Waters from sacrifice came to the Gandharva Visvavasu, O Soma, when
they saw him.  
Indra, approaching quickly, marked their going, and looked around upon
the Sun's enclosures.  
5 This song Visvavasu shall sing us, meter of air's mid-realm celestial
Gandharva,  
That we may know aright both truth and falsehood: may he inspire our
thoughts and help our praises.  
6 In the floods' track he found the bootyseeker: the rocky cow-pen's
doors he threw wide open.  
These, the Gandharva told him, Rowed with Amṛta. Indra knew well the
puissancc of the dragons.
