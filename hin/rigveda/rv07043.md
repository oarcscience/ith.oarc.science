### HYMN XLIII Viśvedevas.

1\. SING out the pious at your sacrifices to move with adorations Earth
and Heaven-  
The Holy Singers, whose unmatched devotions, like a tree's branches,
part in all directions.  
2 Let sacrifice proceed like some fleet courser: with one accord lift ye
on high the ladles.  
Strew sacred grass meet for the solenm service: bright flames that love
the Gods have mounted upward.  
3 Like babes in arms reposing on their mother, let the Gods sit upon the
grass's summit.  
Let general fire make bright the flame of worship: scorn us not, Agni,
in the Gods’ assembly.  
4 Gladly the Gods have let themselves be honoured, milking the copious
streams of holy Order.  
The highest might to-day is yours, the Vasits': come ye, as many as ye
are, one-minded.  
5 So, Agni, send us wealth among the people: may we be closely knit to
thee, O Victor,  
Unharmed, and rich, and taking joy together. Preserve us evermore, ye
ods, with blessings.
