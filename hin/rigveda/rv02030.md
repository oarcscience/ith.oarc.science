### HYMN XXX. Indra and Others.

1\. THE streams unceasing flow to Indra, slayer of Ahi, Savitar, God,
Law's fulfiller,  
Day after day goes on the sheen of waters. What time hath past since
they were first set flowing?  
2 His Mother—for she knew—spake and proclaimed him who was about to cast
his bolt at Vṛtra.  
Cutting their paths according to his pleasure day after day flow to
their goal the rivers.  
3 Aloft he stood above the airy region, and against Vṛtra shot his
deadly missile.  
Enveloped in a cloud he rushed upon him. Indra subdued the foe with
sharpened weapons.  
4 As with a bolt, Bṛhaspati, fiercely flaming, pierce thou Vṛkadvaras’,
the Asura's, heroes.  
Even as in time of old with might thou slewest, so slay even now our
enemy, O Indra.  
5 Cast down from heaven on high thy bolt of thunder wherewith in joy
thou smitest dead the foeman.  
For gain of children make us thine, O Indra, of many children's children
and of cattle.  
6 Whomso ye love, his power ye aid and strengthen; ye Twain are the rich
worshipper's advancers.  
Graciously favour us, Indra and Soma; give us firm standing in this time
of danger.  
7 Let it not vex me, tire me, make me slothful, and never let us say,
Press not the Soma;  
For him who cares for me, gives gifts, supports me, who comes with kine
to me who pour libations.  
8 Sarasvatī, protect us: with the Maruts allied thou boldly conquerest
our foemen,  
While Indra does to death the daring chieftain of Śaṇḍikas exulting in
his prowess.  
9 Him who waylays, yea, him who would destroy us,—aim at him, pierce him
with thy sharpened weapon.  
Bṛhaspati, with arms thou slayest foemen O King, give up the spoiler to
destruction.  
10 Perform, O Hero, with our valiant heroes the deeds heroic which thou
hast to finish.  
Long have they been inflated with presumption: slay them, and bring us
hither their possessions.  
11 I craving joy address with hymn and homage your heavenly host, the
company of Maruts,  
That we may gain wealth with full store of heroes, each day more famous,
and with troops of children.
