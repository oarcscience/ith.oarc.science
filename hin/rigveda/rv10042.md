### HYMN XLII. Indra.

1\. EVEN as an archer shoots afar his arrow, offer the laud to him with
meet adornment.  
Quell with your voice the wicked's voice, O sages. Singer, make Indra
rest beside the Soma.  
2 Draw thy Friend to thee like a cow at milking: O Singer, wake up Indra
as a lover.  
Make thou the Hero haste to give us riches even as a vessel filled
brimful with treasure.  
3 Why, Maghavan, do they call thee Bounteous; Giver? Quicken me: thou, I
hear, art he who quickens.  
Śakra, let my intelligence be active, and bring us luck that finds great
wealth, O Indra.  
4 Standing, in battle for their rights, together, the people, Indra, in
the fray invoke thee.  
Him who brings gifts the Hero makes his comrade: with him who pours no
juice he seeks not friendship.  
5 Whoso with plenteous food for him expresses strong Somas as much
quickly-coming treasure,  
For him he overthrows in early morning his swift well-weaponed foes, and
slays the tyrant.  
6 He unto whom we offer praises, Indra, Maghavan, who hath joined to
ours his wishes,—  
Before him even afar the foe must tremble: low before him must bow all
human glories.  
7 With thy fierce bolt, O God invoked of many, drive to a distance from
afar the foeman.  
O Indra, give us wealth in corn and cattle, and make thy singer's prayer
gain strength and riches.  
8 Indra, the swallower of strong libations rich in the boons they bring,
the potent Somas,  
He, Maghavan, will not restrict his bounty he brings much wealth unto
the Soma-presser.  
9 Yea, by superior play he wins advantage, when he, a gambler, piles his
gains in season.  
Celestial-natured, he o’erwhelms with riches the devotee who keeps not
back his treasure.  
10 O Much-invoked, may we subdue all famine and evil want with store of
grain and cattle.  
May we allied, as first in rank, with princes obtain possessions by our
own exertion.  
11 Bṛhaspati protect us from the rearward, and from above, and from
below, from sinners!  
May Indra from the front, and from the centre, as Friend to friends,
vouchsafe us room and freedom.
