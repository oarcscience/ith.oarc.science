### HYMN CLXV. Indra. Maruts.

1\. WITH what bright beauty are the Maruts jointly invested, peers in
age, who dwell together?  
From what place have they come? With what intention? Sing they their
strength through love of wealth, these Heroes?  
2 Whose prayers have they, the Youthful Ones, accepted? Who to his
sacrifice hath turned the Maruts?  
We will delay them on their journey sweeping—with what high
spirit!—through the air like eagles.  
3 Whence comest thou alone, thou who art mighty, Indra, Lord of the
Brave? What is thy purpose?  
Thou greetest us when meeting us the Bright Ones. Lord of Bay Steeds,
say what thou hast against us.  
4 Mine are devotions, hymns; sweet are libations. Strength stirs, and
hurled forth is my bolt of thunder.  
They call for me, their lauds are longing for me. These my Bay Steeds
bear me to these oblations.  
5 Therefore together with our strong companions, having adorned our
bodies, now we harness,  
Our spotted deer with might, for thou, O Indra, hast learnt and
understood our Godlike nature.  
6 Where was that nature then of yours, O Maruts, that ye charged me
alone to slay the Dragon?  
For I in truth am fierce and strong and mighty. I bent away from every
foeman's weapons.  
7 Yea, much hast thou achieved with us for comrades, with manly valour
like thine own, thou Hero.  
Much may we too achieve, O mightiest Indra, with our great power, we
Maruts, when we will it.  
8 Vṛtra I slew by mine own strength, O Maruts, having waxed mighty in
mine indignation.  
I with the thunder in my hand created for man these lucid softly flowing
waters.  
9 Nothing, O Maghavan, stands firm before thee; among the Gods not one
is found thine equal.  
None born or springing into life comes nigh thee. Do what thou hast to
do, exceeding mighty?  
10 Mine only be transcendent power, whatever I, daring in my spirit, may
accomplish.  
For I am known as terrible, O Maruts I, Indra, am the Lord of what I
ruined.  
11 Now, O ye Maruts, hath your praise rejoiced me, the glorious hymn
which ye have made me, Heroes!  
For me, for Indra, champion strong in battle, for me, yourselves, as
lovers for a lover.  
12 Here, truly, they send forth their sheen to meet me, wearing their
blameless glory and their vigour.  
When I have seen you, Maruts, in gay splendour, ye have delighted me, so
now delight me.  
13 Who here hath magnified you, O ye Maruts? speed forward, O ye lovers,
to your lovers.  
Ye Radiant Ones, assisting their devotions, of these my holy rites he ye
regardful.  
14 To this hath Mānya's wisdom brought us, so as to aid, as aids the
poet him who worships.  
Bring hither quick! On to the sage, ye Maruts! These prayers for you the
singer hath recited.  
15 May this your praise, may this your song, O Maruts, sung by the poet,
Māna's son, Māndārya,  
Bring offspring for ourselves with food to feed us. May we find
strengthening food in full abundance!
