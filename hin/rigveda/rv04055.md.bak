### HYMN LV. Viśvedevas.

1\. WHO of you, Vasus, saveth? who protecteth? O Heaven and Earth and
Aditi, preserve us,  
Varuṇa., Mitra, from the stronger mortal. Gods, which of you at
sacrifice giveth comfort?  
2 They who with laud extol the ancient statutes, when they shine forth
infallible dividers,  
Have ordered as perpetual Ordainers, and beamed as holy-thoughted
Wonder-Workers.  
3 The Housewife Goddess, Aditi, and Sindhu, the Goddess Svasti I implore
for friendship:  
And may the unobstructed Night and Morning both, day and night, provide
for our protection.  
4 Aryaman, Varuṇa have disclosed the pathway, Agni as Lord of Strength
the road to welfare.  
Lauded in manly mode may Indra-Viṣṇu grant us their powerful defence and
shelter.  
5 I have besought the favour of the Maruts, of Parvata, of Bhaga God who
rescues.  
From trouble caused by man the Lord preserve us; from woe sent by his
friend let Mitra save us.  
6 Agree, through these our watery oblations, Goddesses, Heaven and
Earth, with Ahibudhnya.  
As if to win the sea, the Gharma-heaters have opened, as they come
anear, the rivers.  
7 May Goddess Aditi with Gods defend us, save us the saviour God with
care unceasing.  
We dare not stint the sacred food of Mitra and Varuṇa upon the back of
Agni.  
8 Agni is Sovran Lord of wealth, Agni of great prosperity:  
May he bestow these gifts on us.  
9 Hither to us, rich pleasant Dawn, bring many things to be desired,  
Thou who hast ample store of wealth.  
10 So then may Bhaga, Savitar, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, Indra, with
bounty come to us.
