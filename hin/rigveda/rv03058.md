### HYMN LVIII. Aśvins.

1\. THE Ancient's Milch-cow yields the things we long for: the Son of
Dakṣiṇā travels between them.  
She with the splendid chariot brings refulgence. The praise of Uṣas hath
awoke the Aśvins.  
2 They bear you hither by well-orderd statute: our sacred offerings rise
as if to parents.  
Destroy in us the counsel of the niggard come hitherward, for we have
shown you favour.  
3 With lightly-rolling car and well-yoked horses hear this, the
press-stone's song, ye Wonder-Workers.  
Have not the sages of old time, ye Aśvins, called you most prompt to
come and stay misfortune?  
4 Remember us, and come to us, for ever men, as their wont is, invocate
the Aśvins.  
Friends as it were have offered you these juices, sweet, blent with milk
at the first break of morning.  
5 Even through many regions, O ye Aśvins high praise is yours among
mankind, ye Mighty-  
Come, helpers, on the paths which Gods have travelled: here your
libations of sweet meath are ready.  
6 Ancient your home, auspicious is your friendship: Heroes, your wealth
is with the house of Jahnu.  
Forming again with you auspicious friendship, let us rejoice with
draughts of meath together.  
7 O Aśvins, Very Mighty ones, with Vāyu and with his steeds, one-minded,
ever-youthful,  
Nāsatyas, joying in the third day's Soma, drink it, not hostile, Very
Bounteous Givers.  
8 Aśvins, to you are brought abundant viands in rivalry with sacred
songs, unceasing.  
Sprung from high Law your car, urged on by press-stones, goes round the
earth and heaven in one brief moment.  
9 Aśvins, your Soma sheds delicious sweetness: drink ye thereof and come
unto our dwelling.  
Your car, assuming many a shape, most often goes to the Soma-presser's
place of meeting.
