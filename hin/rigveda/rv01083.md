### HYMN LXXXIII. Indra.

1\. INDRA, the mortal man well guarded by thine aid goes foremost in the
wealth of horses and of kine.  
With amplest wealth thou fillest him, as round about the waters clearly
seen afar fill Sindhu full.  
2 The heavenly Waters come not nigh the priestly bowl: they but look
down and see how far mid-air is spread:  
The Deities conduct the pious man to them: like suitors they delight in
him who loveth prayer.  
3 Praiseworthy blessing hast thou laid upon the pair who with uplifted
ladle serve thee, man and wife.  
Unchecked he dwells and prospers in thy law: thy power brings blessing
to the sacrificer pouring gifts.  
4 First the Aṅgirases won themselves vital power, whose fires were
kindled through good deeds and sacrifice.  
The men together found the Paṇi's hoarded wealth, the cattle, and the
wealth in horses and in kine.  
5 Atharvan first by sacrifices laid the paths then, guardian of the Law,
sprang up the loving Sun.  
Uśanā Kāvya straightway hither drove the kine. Let us with offerings
honour Yama's deathless birth.  
6 When sacred grass is trimmed to aid the auspicious work, or the hymn
makes its voice of praise sound to the sky.  
Where the stone rings as ’twere a singer skilled in laud,—Indra in truth
delights when these come near to him.
