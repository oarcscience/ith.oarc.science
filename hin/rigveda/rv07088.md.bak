### HYMN LXXXVIII. Varuṇa.

1\. PRESENT to Varuṇa thine hymn, Vasiṣṭha, bright, most delightful to
the Bounteous Giver,  
Who bringeth on to us the Bull, the lofty, the Holy, laden with a
thousand treasures.  
2 And now, as I am come before his presence, I take the face of Varuṇa
for Agni's.  
So might he bring-Lord also of the darkness-the light in heaven that I
may see its beauty!  
3 When Varuṇa and I embark together and urge our boat into the midst of
ocean,  
We, when we ride o’er ridges of the waters, will swing within that swing
and there be happy.  
4 Varuṇa placed Vasiṣṭha in the vessel, and deftly with his niight made
him a Ṛṣi.  
When days shone bright the Sage made him a singer, while the heavens
broadened and the Dawns were lengthened.  
5 What hath become of those our ancient friendships, when without enmity
we walked together?  
I, Varuṇa, thou glorious Lord, have entered thy lofty home, thine house
with thousand portals.  
6 If he, thy true ally, hath sinned against thee, still, Varuṇa, he is
the friend thou lovedst.  
Let us not, Living One, as sinners I know thee: give shelter, as a Sage,
to him who lauds thee.  
7 While we abide in these fixed habitations, and from the lap of Aditi
win favour,  
May Varuṇa untie the bond that binds us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods,
with blessings.
