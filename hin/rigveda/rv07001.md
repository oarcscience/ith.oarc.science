### HYMN I. Agni.

1\. THE men from fire-sticks, with their hands' swift movement, have, in
deep thought, engendered glorious Agni,  
Far-seen, with pointed flame, Lord of the homestead.  
2 The Vasus set that Agni in the dwelling, fair to behold, for help from
every quarter:  
Who, in the home for ever, must be honoured.  
3 Shine thou before us, Agni, well-enkindled, with flame, Most Youthful
God, that never fadeth.  
To thee come all our sacrificial viands.  
4 Among all fires these fires have shone most brightly, splendid with
light, begirt by noble heroes,  
Where men of lofty birth sit down together.  
5 Victorious Agni, grant us wealth with wisdom, wealth with brave sons,
famous and independent,  
Which not a foe who deals in magic conquers.  
6 To whom, the Strong, at morn and eve comes, maid-like, the ladle
dropping oil, with its oblation.  
Wealth-seeking comes to him his own devotion.  
7 Burn up all malice with those flames, O Agni, wherewith of old thou
burntest up Jarutha,  
And drive away in silence pain and sickness.  
8 With him who lighteth up thy splendour, Agni, excellent, pure,
refulgent, Purifier,  
Be present, and with us through these our praises.  
9 Agni, the patriarchal men, the mortals who have in many places spread
thy lustre,—  
Be gracious to us here for their sake also.  
10 Let these men, heroes in the fight with foemen, prevail against all
godless arts of 4magic,—  
These who ipprove the noble song I sing thee.  
11 Let us not sit in want of men, O Agni, without descendants, heroleu,
about thee:  
But, O House-Friend, in houses full of children.  
12 By sacrifice which the Steeds' Lord ever visits, there make our
dwelling rich in seed and offspring,  
Increasing still with lineal successors.  
13 Guard us, O Agni, from the hated demon, guard us from malice of the
churlish sinner:  
Allied with thee may I subdue assailants.  
14 May this same fire of mine surpass all others, this fire where
offspring, vigorous and firm-handed,  
Wins, on a thousand paths, what ne’er shall perish.  
15 This is that Agni, saviour from the foeman, who guards the kindler of
the flame from sorrow:  
Heroes of noble lineage serve and tend him.  
16 This is that Agni, served in many places, whom the rich lord who
brings oblation kindles,  
And round him goes the priest at sacrifices.  
17 Agni, may we with riches in possession bring thee continual ofierings
in abundance,  
Using both means to draw thee to our worship.  
18 Agni, bear thou, Eternal, these most welcome oblations to the
Deities' assembly:  
Let them enjoy our very fragrant presents.  
19 Give us not up, Agni, to want of heroes, to wretched clothes, to
need, to destitution.  
Yield us not, Holy One, to fiend or hunger; injure us not at home or in
the forest.  
20 Give strength and power to these my prayers, O Agni; O God, pour
blessings on our chiefs and nobles.  
Grant that both we and they may share thy bounty. Ye Gods, protect us
evermore with blessings.  
21 Thou Agni, swift to hear, art fair of aspect: beam forth, O Son of
Strength, in full effulgence.  
Let me not want, with thee, a son for ever: let not a manly hero ever
fail us.  
22 Condemn us not to indigence, O Agni, beside these flaming fires which
Gods have kindled;  
Nor, even after fault, let thy displeasure, thine as a God, O Son of
Strength, o’ertake us.  
23 O Agni, fair of face, the wealthy mortal who to the Immortal offers
his oblation.  
Hath him who wins him treasure by his Godhead, to whom the prince, in
need, goes supplicating.  
24 Knowing our chief felicity, O Agni, bring hither ample riches to our
nobles,  
Wherewith we may enjoy ourselves, O Victor, with undiminished life and
hero children.  
25 Give strength and power to these my prayers, O Agni; O God, pour
blessings on bur chiefs and nobles.  
Grant that both we and they may share thy bounty. Ye Gods, protect us
evermore with blessings.
