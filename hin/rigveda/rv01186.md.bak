### HYMN CLXXXVI. Viśvedevas.

1\. LOVED of all men, may Savitar, through praises offered as sacred
food, come to our synod,  
That you too, through-our hymn, ye ever-youthful, may gladden, at your
visit, all our people.  
2 To us may all the Gods come trooped together, Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa
concordant,  
That all may be promoters of our welfare, and with great might preserve
our strength from slackness.  
3 Agni I sing, the guest you love most dearly: the Conqueror through our
lauds is friendly-minded.  
That he may be our Varuṇa rich in glory and send food like a prince
praised by the godly.  
4 To you I seek with reverence, Night and Morning, like a cow good to
milk, with hope to conquer,  
Preparing on a common day the praise. song with milk of various hues
within this udder.  
5 May the great Dragon of the Deep rejoice us: as one who nourishes her
young comes Sindhu,  
With whom we will incite the Child of Waters whom vigorous course swift
as thought bring hither.  
6 Moreover Tvaṣṭar also shall approach us, one-minded with the princes
at his visit.  
Hither shall come the Vṛtra-slayer Indra, Ruler of men, as strongest of
the Heroes.  
7 Him too our hymns delight, that yoke swift horses, like mother cows
who lick their tender youngling.  
To him our songs shall yield themselves like spouses, to him the most
delightful of the Heroes.  
8 So may the Maruts, armed with mighty weapons, rest here on heaven and
earth with hearts in concord,  
As Gods whose cars have dappled steeds like torrents, destroyers of the
foe allies of Mitra.  
9 They hasten on to happy termination their orders when they are made
known by  
glory.  
As on a fair bright day the arrow flieth o’er all the barren soil their
missiles sparkle.  
10 Incline the Aśvins to show grace, and Pūṣan, for power and might have
they, their own possession.  
Friendly are Viṣṇu, Vāta, and Ṛbhukṣan so may I bring the Gods to make
us happy.  
11 This is my reverent thought of you, ye Holy; may it inspire you, make
you dwell among us,—  
Thought, toiling for the Gods and seeking treasure. May we find
strengthening food in full abundance.
