### HYMN LXXIX. Dawn.

1\. O HEAVENLY Dawn, awaken us to ample opulence to-day  
Even as thou hast wakened us with Satyasravas, Vayya's son, high-born!
delightful with thy steeds!  
2 Daughter of Heaven, thou dawnedst on Sunitha Sucadratha's son,  
So dawn thou on one mightier still, on Satyasravas, Vayya's son,
high-born! delightful with thy steeds!  
3 So, bringing treasure, dawn to-day on us thou Daughter of the Sky,  
As thou, O mightier yet. didst shine for Satyatravas, Vayya's son,
high-born! delightful with thy steeds!  
4 Here round about thee are the priests who laud thee, Bright One, with
their hymns,  
And men with gifts, O Bounteous Dame, splendid with wealth and offering
much, high-born! delightful with thy steeds!  
5 Whatever these thy bands perform to please thee or to win them
wealth,  
E’en fain they gird us round and give rich gifts which ne’er are reft
away, high-born! delightful with thy steeds!  
6 Give to these wealthy patrons fame, O affluent Dawn, with hero sons,  
To these our princes who have brought rich gifts ne’er to be reft away,
highborn! delightful with thy steeds!  
7 Bring lofty and resplendent fame, O thou munificent Dawn, to these  
Our wealthy patrons who bestow rich gifts on us of steeds and kine,
high-born! delightful with thy steeds!  
8 Bring us, O Daughter of the Sky, subsistence in our herds of kine,  
Together with the sunbeams, with the shine of pure refulgent flames,
highborn! delightful with thy steeds!  
9 O Daughter of the Sky, shine forth; delay not to perform thy task.  
Let not the Sun with fervent heat consume thee like a robber foe,
high-born! delightful with the steeds!  
10 So much, and more exceedingly, O Dawn, it suits thee to bestow,  
Thou Radiant One who ceasest not to shine for those who sing thy praise,
highborn! delightful with thy steeds!
