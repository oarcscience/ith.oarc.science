### HYMN CXLVII. Agni.

1\. How, Agni, have the radiant ones, aspiring, endued thee with the
vigour of the living,  
So that on both sides fostering seed and offspring, the Gods may joy in
Holy Law's fulfilment?  
2 Mark this my speech, Divine One, thou, Most Youthful! offered to thee
by him who gives most freely.  
One hates thee, and another sings thy praises: I thine adorer laud thy
form, O Agni.  
3 Thy guardian rays, O Agni, when they saw him, preserved blind Māmateya
from affliction.  
Lord of all riches, he preserved the pious the foes who fain would harm
them did no mischief.  
4 The sinful man who worships not, O Agni, who, offering not, harms us
with double-dealing,—  
Be this in turn to him a heavy sentence: may he distress himself by his
revilings.  
5 Yea, when a mortal knowingly, O Victor, injures with double tongue a
fellow-mortal,  
From him, praised Agni! save thou him that lauds thee: bring us not into
trouble and affliction.
