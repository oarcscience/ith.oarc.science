### HYMN XXIII. Indra.

1\. THOU art attached to pressed-out Soma, Indra, at laud, at prayer,
and when the hymn is chanted;  
Or when with yoked Bays, Maghavan, thou comest, O Indra, bearing in
thine arms the thunder.  
2 Or when on that decisive day thou holpest the presser of the juice at
Vṛtra's slaughter;  
Or when thou, while the strong one feared, undaunted, gavest to death,
Indra, the daring Dasyus.  
3 Let Indra drink the pressed-out Soma, Helper and mighty Guide of him
who sings his praises.  
He gives the hero room who pours oblations, and treasure even to the
lowly singer.  
4 E’en humble rites with his Bay steeds he visits: he wields the bolt,
drinks Soma, gives us cattle.  
He makes the valiant rich in store of heroes, accepts our praise and
hears the singer's calling.  
5 What he hath longed for we have brought to Indra, who from the days of
old hath done us service.  
While Soma flows we will sing hymn, and laud him, so that our prayer may
streng. then Indra's vigour.  
6 Thou hast made prayer the means of thine exalting, therefore we wait
on thee with hymns, O Indra.  
May we, by the pressed Soma, Somadrinker! bring thee, with sacrifice,
blissful sweet refreshment.  
7 Mark well our sacrificial cake, delighted Indra, drink Soma and the
milk commingled.  
Here on the sacrificer's grass be seated: give ample room to thy devoted
servant.  
8 O Mighty One, be joyful as thou willest. Let these our sacrifices
reach and find thee;  
And may this hymn and these our invocations turn thee, whom many men
invoke, to help us.  
9 Friends, when thejuices flow, replenish duly your own, your bounteous
Indra with the Soma.  
Will it not aid him to support us? Indra. spares him who sheds the juice
to win his favour.  
10 While Soma flowed, thus Indra hath been lauded, Ruler of nobles, mid
the Bharadvājas,  
That Indra may become the singer's patron and give him wealth in every
kind of treasure.
