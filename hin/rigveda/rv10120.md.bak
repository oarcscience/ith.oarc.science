### HYMN CXX. Indra.

1\. IN all the worlds That was the Best and Highest whence sprang the
Mighty Gods, of splendid valour.  
As soon as born he overcomes his foemen, be in whom all who lend him aid
are joyful.  
2 Grown mighty in his strength, with ample vigour, he as a foe strikes
fear into the Dāsa,  
Eager to win the breathing and the breathless. All sang thy praise at
banquet and oblation.  
3 All concentrate on thee their mental vigour, what time these, twice or
thrice, are thine assistants.  
Blend what is sweeter than the sweet with sweetness: win. quickly with
our meath that meath in battle.  
4 Therefore in thee too, thou who winnest riches, at every banquet are
the sages joyful.  
With mightier power, Bold God, extend thy firmness: let not malignant
Yātudhānas harm thee.  
5 Proudly we put our trust in thee in battles, when we behold great
wealth the prize of combat.  
I with my words impel thy weapons onward, and sharpen with my prayer thy
vital vigour.  
6 Worthy of praises, many-shaped, most skilful, most energetic, Āptya of
the Aptyas:  
He with his might destroys the seven Danus, subduing many who were
deemed his equals.  
7 Thou in that house which thy protection guardeth bestowest wealth, the
higher and the lower.  
Thou stablishest the two much-wandering Mothers, and bringest many deeds
to their completion.  
8 Brhaddiva, the foremost of light-winners, repeats these holy prayers,
this strength of Indra.  
He rules the great self-luminous fold of cattle, and all the doors of
light hath he thrown open.  
9 Thus hath Brhaddiva, the great Atharvan, spoken to Indra as himself in
person.  
The spotless Sisters, they who are his Mothers, with power exalt him and
impel him onward.
