### HYMN CXXXIII. Indra.

1\. WITH sacrifice I purge both earth and heaven: I burn up great
she-fiends who serve not Indra,  
Where throttled by thy hand the foes were slaughtered, and in the pit of
death lay pierced and mangled.  
2 O thou who castest forth the stones crushing the sorceresses’ heads,  
Break them with thy wide-spreading foot, with thy wide-spreading mighty
foot.  
3 Do thou, O Maghavan, beat off these sorceresses' daring strength.  
Cast them within the narrow pit. within the deep and narrow pit.  
4 Of whom thou hast ere now destroyed thrice-fifty with thy fierce
attacks.  
That deed they count a glorious deed, though small to thee, a glorious
deed.  
5 O Indra, crush and bray to bits the fearful fiery-weaponed fiend:  
Strike every demon to the ground.  
6 Tear down the mighty ones. O Indra, hear thou us. For heaven hath
glowed like earth in fear, O Thunder-armed, as dreading fierce heat,
Thunder-armed!  
Most Mighty mid the Mighty Ones thou speedest with strong bolts of
death,  
Not slaying men, unconquered Hero with the brave, O Hero, with the
thrice-seven brave.  
7 The pourer of libations gains the home of wealth, pouring his gift
conciliates hostilities, yea, the hostilities of Gods.  
Pouring, he strives, unchecked and strong, to win him riches
thousandfold.  
Indra gives lasting wealth to him who pours forth gifts, yea, wealth he
gives that long shall last.
