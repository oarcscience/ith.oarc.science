### HYMN XXXV. Savitar.

1 AGNI I first invoke for our prosperity; I call on Mitra, Varuṇa, to
aid us here.  
I call on Night who gives rest to all moving life; I call on Savitar the
God to lend us help.  
2 Throughout the dusky firmament advancing, laying to rest the immortal
and the mortal,  
Borne in his golden chariot he cometh, Savitar, God who looks on every
creature.  
3 The God moves by the upward path, the downward; with two bright Bays,
adorable, he journeys.  
Savitar comes, the God from the far distance, and chases from us all
distress and sorrow.  
4 His chariot decked with pearl, of various colours, lofty, with golden
pole, the God hath mounted,  
The many-rayed One, Savitar the holy, bound, bearing power and might,
for darksome regions.  
5 Drawing the gold-yoked car his Bays, white-footed, have manifested
light to all the peoples.  
Held in the lap of Savitar, divine One, all men, all beings have their
place for ever.  
6 Three heavens there are; two Savitar's, adjacent: in Yama's world is
one, the home of heroes,  
As on a linch-pin, firm, rest things immortal: he who hath known it let
him here declare it.  
7 He, strong of wing, hath lightened up the regions, deep-quivering
Asura, the gentle Leader.  
Where now is Sūrya, where is one to tell us to what celestial sphere his
ray hath wandered?  
8 The earth's eight points his brightness hath illumined, three desert
regions and the Seven Rivers.  
God Savitar the gold-eyed hath come hither, giving choice treasures unto
him who worships.  
9 The golden-handed Savitar, far-seeing, goes on his way between the
earth and heaven,  
Drives away sickness, bids the Sun approach us, and spreads the bright
sky through the darksome region.  
10 May he, gold-handed Asura, kind Leader, come hither to us with his
help and favour.  
Driving off Rākṣasas and Yātudhānas, the God is present, praised in
hymns at evening.  
11 O Savitar, thine ancient dustless pathways are well established in
the air's mid-region:  
O God, come by those paths so fair to travel, preserve thou us from harm
this day, and bless us.
