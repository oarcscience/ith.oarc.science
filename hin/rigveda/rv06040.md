### HYMN XL. Indra

1\. DRINK, Indra; juice is shed to make thee joyful: loose thy Bay
Steeds and give thy friends their freedom.  
Begin the song, seated in our assembly. Give strength for sacrifice to
him who singeth.  
2 Drink thou of this whereof at birth, O Indra, thou drankest, Mighty
One for power and rapture.  
The men, the pressing-stones, the cows, the waters have made this Soma
ready for thy drinking.  
3 The fire is kindled, Soma pressed, O Indra: let thy Bays, best to
draw, convey thee hither.  
With mind devoted, Indra, I invoke thee. Come, for our great prosperity
approach us.  
4 Indra, come hither: evermore thou camest through our great strong
desire to drink the Soma.  
Listen and hear the prayers which now we offer, and let this sacrifice
increase thy vigour.  
5 Mayst thou, O Indra, on the day of trial, present or absent,
wheresoe’er thou dwellest,  
Thence, with thy team, accordant with the Maruts, Song-lover! guard our
sacrifice, to help us.
