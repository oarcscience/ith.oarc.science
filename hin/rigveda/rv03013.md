### HYMN XIII. Agni.

1\. To Agni, to this God of yours I sing aloud with utmost power.  
May he come to us with the Gods, and sit, best Offerer, on the grass.  
2 The Holy, whose are earth and heaven, and succour waits upon his
strength;  
Him men who bring oblations laud, and they who wish to gain, for
grace.  
3 He is the Sage who guides these men, Leader of sacred rites is he.  
Him your own Agni, serve ye well, who winneth and bestoweth wealth.  
4 So may the gracious Agni grant most goodly shelter for our use;  
Whence in the heavens or in the floods he shall pour wealth upon our
lands.  
5 The singers kindle him, the Priest, Agni the Lord of tribes of men,  
Resplendent and without a peer through his own excellent designs.  
6 Help us, thou Brahman, best of all invokers of the Gods in song.  
Beam, Friend of Maruts, bliss on us, O Agni, a most liberal God.  
7 Yea, grant us treasure thousandfold with children and with
nourishment,  
And, Agni, splendid hero strength, exalted, wasting not away.
