### HYMN CXXXVII. Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. WITH stones have we pressed out: O come; these gladdening drops are
blent with milk, these Soma-drops which gladden you.  
Come to us, Kings who reach to heaven, approach us, coming hitherward.  
These milky drops are yours, Mitra and Varuṇa, bright Soma juices blent
with milk.  
2 Here are the droppings; come ye nigh the Soma-droppings blent with
curd, juices expressed and blent with curd.  
Now for the wakening of your Dawn together with the Sun-God's rays,  
juice waits for Mitra and for Varuṇa to drink, fair juice for drink, for
sacrifice.  
3 As ’twere a radiant-coloured cow, they milk with stones the stalk for
you, with stones they milk the Soma-plant.  
May ye come nigh us, may ye turn hither to drink the Soma juice.  
The men pressed out this juice, Mitra and Varuṇa, pressed out this Soma
for your drink.
