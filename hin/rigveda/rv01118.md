### HYMN CXVIII. Aśvins.

1\. FLYING, with falcons, may your chariot, Aśvins, most gracious,
bringing friendly  
help, come hither,—  
Your chariot, swifter than the mind of mortal, fleet as the wind,
three-seated O ye Mighty.  
2 Come to us with your chariot triple seated, three-wheeled, of triple
form, that rolleth lightly.  
Fill full our cows, give mettle to our horses, and make each hero son
grow strong, O Aśvins.  
3 With your well-rolling car, descending swiftly, hear this the
press-stone's song, ye Wonder-Workers.  
How then have ancient sages said, O Aśvins, that ye most swiftly come to
stay affliction?  
4 O Aśvins, let your falcons bear you hither, yoked to your chariot,
swift, with flying pinions,  
Which, ever active, like the airy eagles, carry you, O Nāsatyas, to the
banquet.  
5 The youthful Daughter of the Sun, delighting in you, ascended there
your chariot, Heroes.  
Borne on their swift wings let your beauteous horses, your birds of
ruddy hue, convey you near us.  
6 Ye raised up Vandana, strong Wonder-Workers! with great might, and
with power ye rescued Rebha.  
From out the sea ye saved the son of Tugra, and gave his youth again
unto Cyavāna.  
7 To Atri, cast down to the fire that scorched him, ye gave, O Aśvins,
strengthening food and favour.  
Accepting his fair praises with approval, ye gave his eyes again to
blinded Kaṇva.  
8 For ancient Śayu in his sore affliction ye caused his cow to swell
with milk, O Aśvins.  
The quail from her great misery ye delivered, and a new leg for Viśpalā
provided.  
9 A white horse, Aśvins, ye bestowed on Pedu, a serpent-slaying steed
sent down by Indra,  
Loud-neighing, conquering the foe, high-mettled, firm-limbed and
vigorous, winning thousand treasures.  
10 Such as ye are, O nobly born, O Heroes, we in our trouble call on you
for succour.  
Accepting these our songs, for our wellbeing come to us on your chariot
treasure-laden.  
11 Come unto us combined in love, Nāsatyas come with the fresh swift
vigour of the falcon.  
Bearing oblations I invoke you, Aśvins, at the first break of
everlasting morning.
