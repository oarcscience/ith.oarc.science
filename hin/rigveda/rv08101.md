### HYMN IX. Aśvins.

1\. ENDOWED, O Gods, with your primeval wisdom, come quickly with your
chariot, O ye Holy.  
Come with your mighty powers, O ye Nāsatyas; come hither, drink ye this
the third libation.  
2 The truthful Deities, the Three-and-Thirty, saw you approach before
the Ever-Truthful.  
Accepting this our worship and libation, O Aśvins bright with fire,
drink ye the Soma.  
3 Aśvins, that work of yours deserves our wonder,—the Bull of heaven and
earth and air's mid region;  
Yea, and your thousand promises in battle, -to all of these come near
and drink beside us.  
4 Here is your portion laid for you, ye Holy: come to these songs of
ours, O ye Nāsatyas.  
Drink among us the Soma full of sweetness, and with your powers assist
the man who worships.
