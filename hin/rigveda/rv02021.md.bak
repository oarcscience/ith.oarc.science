### HYMN XXI.

1\. To him the Lord of all, the Lord of wealth, of light; him who is
Lord for ever, Lord of men and tilth,  
Him who is Lord of horses, Lord of kine, of floods, to Indra, to the
Holy bring sweet Soma juice.  
2 To him the potent One, who conquers and breaks down, the Victor never
vanquished who disposes all,  
The mighty-voiced, the rider, unassailable, to Indra everconquering
speak your reverent prayer.  
3 Still Victor, loved by mortals, ruler over men, o’erthrower, warrior,
he hath waxen as he would;  
Host-gatherer, triumphant, honoured mid the folk. Indra's heroic deeds
will I tell forth to all.  
4 The strong who never yields, who slew the furious fiend, the deep, the
vast, of wisdom unattainable;  
Who speeds the good, the breaker-down, the firm, the vast,—Indra whose
rites bring joy hath made the light of Dawn.  
5 By sacrifice the yearning sages sending forth their songs found
furtherance from him who speeds the flood.  
In Indra seeking help with worship and with hymn, they drew him to
themselves and won them kine and wealth.  
6 Indra, bestow on us the best of treasures, the spirit of ability and
fortune;  
Increase of riches, safety of our bodies, charm of sweet speech, and
days of pleasant weather.
