### HYMN LXXXIV. Manyu.

1\. BORNE on with thee, O Manyu girt by Maruts, let our brave men,
impetuous, bursting forward,  
March on, like flames of fire in form, exulting, with pointed arrows,
sharpening their weapons.  
2 Flashing like fire, be thou, O conquering Manyu, invoked, O Victor, as
our army's leader.  
Slay thou our foes, distribute their possessions: show forth thy vigour,
scatter those who hate us.  
3 O Manyu, overcome thou our assailant on! breaking, slaying, crushing
down the foemen.  
They have not hindered thine impetuous vigour: Mighty, Sole born! thou
makest them thy subjects.  
4 Alone or many thou art worshipped, Manyu: sharpen the spirit of each
clan for battle.  
With thee to aid, O thou of perfect splendour, we will uplift the
glorious shout for conquest.  
5 Unyielding bringing victory like Indra, O Manyu, be thou here our
Sovran Ruler.  
To thy dear name, O Victor, we sing praises: we know the spring from
which thou art come hither.  
6 Twin-born with power, destructive bolt of thunder, the highest
conquering might is thine, Subduer!  
Be friendly to its in thy spirit, Manyu, O Much-invoked, in shock of
mighty battle.  
7 For spoil let Varuṇa and Manyu give us the wealth of both sides
gathered and collected;  
And let our enemies with stricken spirits, o’erwhelmed with terror,
slink away defeated.
