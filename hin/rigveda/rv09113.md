### HYMN CXIII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. LET Vṛtra-slaying Indra drink Soma by Śaryaṇāvān's side,  
Storing up vigour in his heart, prepared to do heroic deeds. Flow, Indu,
flow for Indra's sake.  
2 Lord of the Quarters, flow thou on, boon Soma, from Arjika land,  
Effused with ardour and with faith, and the true hymn of sacrifice.
Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.  
3 Hither hath Sūrya's Daughter brought the wild Steer whom Parjanya
nursed.  
Gandharvas have seized bold of him, and in the Soma laid the juice.
Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.  
4 Splendid by Law! declaring Law, truthspeaking, truthful in thy
works,  
Enouncing faith, King Soma! thou, O Soma, whom thy maker decks. Flow,
Indu, flow for Indra's sake.  
5 Together flow the meeting streams of him the Great and truly Strong.  
The juices of the juicy meet. Made pure by prayer, O Golden-hued, flow,
Indu, flow for Indra's sake.  
6 O Pavamana, where the priest, as he recites the rhythmic prayer,  
Lords it o’er Soma with the stone, with Soma bringing forth delight,
flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.  
7 O Pavarnana, place me in that deathless, undecaying world  
Wherein the light of heaven is set, and everlasting lustre shines. Flow,
Indu, flow for Indra's sake.  
8 Make me immortal in that realm where dwells the King, Vivasvān's
Son,  
Where is the secret shrine of heaven, where are those waters young and
fresh. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.  
9 Make me immortal in that realm where they move even as they list,  
In the third sphere of inmost heaven where lucid worlds are full of
light. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake.  
10 Make me immortal in that realm of eager wish and strong desire,  
The region of the radiant Moon, where food and full delight are found.
Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake:  
11 Make me immortal in that realm where happiness and transports,
where  
Joys and felicities combine, and longing wishes are fulfilled. Flow,
Indu, flow for Indra's sake.
