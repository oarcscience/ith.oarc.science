### HYMN LVII. Indra.

1 To him most liberal, lofty Lord of lofty wealth, verily powerful and
strong, I bring my hymn,—  
Whose checkless bounty, as of waters down a slope, is spread abroad for
all that live, to give them strength.  
2 Now all this world, for worship, shall come after thee—the offerer's
libations like floods to the depth,  
When the well-loved one seems to rest upon the hill, the thunderbolt of
Indra, shatterer wrought of gold.  
3 To him the terrible, most meet for lofty praise, like bright Dawn, now
bring gifts with reverence in this rite,  
Whose being, for renown, yea, Indra-power and light, have been created,
like bay steeds, to move with speed.  
4 Thine, Indra, praised by many, excellently rich! are we who trusting
in thy help draw near to thee.  
Lover of praise, none else but thou receives our laud: as earth loves
all her creatures, love thou this our hymn.  
5 Great is thy power, O Indra, we are thine. Fulfil, O Maghavan, the
wish of this thy worshipper.  
After thee lofty heaven hath measured out its strength: to thee and to
thy power this earth hath bowed itself.  
6 Thou, who hast thunder for thy weapon, with thy bolt hast shattered
into pieces this broad massive cloud.  
Thou hast sent down the obstructed floods that they may flow: thou hast,
thine own for ever, all victorious might.
