### HYMN XXV. Indra.

1\. WHAT friend of man, God-loving, hath delighted, yearning therefor,
this day in Indra's friendship?  
Who with enkindled flame and flowing Soma laudeth him for his great
protecting favour?  
2 Who hath with prayer bowed to the Soma-lover? What pious man endues
the beams of morning?  
Who seeks bond, friendship, brotherhood with Indra? Who hath recourse
unto the Sage for succour?  
3 Who claims to-day the Deities' protection, asks Aditi for light, or
the Ādityas?  
Of whose pressed stalk of Soma drink the Aśvins, Indra, and Agni,
well-inclined in spirit?  
4 To him shall Agni Bhārata give shelter: long shall he look upon the
Sun up-rising,  
Who sayeth, Let us press the juice for Indra, man's Friend, the Hero
manliest of heroes.  
5 Him neither few men overcome, nor many to him shall Aditi give
spacious shelter.  
Dear is the pious, the devout, to Indra dear is the zealous, dear the
Soma-bringer.  
6 This Hero curbs the mighty for the zealous: the presser's brew Indra
possesses solely:  
No brother, kin, or friend to him who pours not, destroyer of the dumb
who would resist him.  
7 Not with the wealthy churl who pours no Soma doth Indra, Soma-drinker,
bind alliance.  
He draws away his wealth and slays him naked, own Friend to him who
offers, for oblation.  
8 Highest and lowest, men who stand between diem, going, returning,
dwelling in contentment,  
Those who show forth their strength when urged to battle-these are the
men who call for aid on Indra.
