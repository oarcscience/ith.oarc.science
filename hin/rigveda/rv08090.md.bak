### HYMN XC. Various.

1\. YEA, specially that mortal man hath toiled for service of the
Gods,  
Who quickly hath brought near Mitra and Varuṇa. to share his sacrificial
gifts.  
2 Supreme in sovran power, far-sighted, Chiefs and Kings, most swift to
hear from far away,  
Both, wondrously, set them in motion as with arms, in company with
Sūrya's beams.  
3 The rapid messenger who runs before you, Mitra-Varuṇa, with iron head,
swift to the draught,  
4 He whom no man may question, none may summon back, who stands not
still for colloquy,—  
From hostile clash with him keep ye us safe this day: keep us in safety
with your arms.  
5 To Aryaman and Mitra sing a reverent song, O pious one,  
A pleasant hymn that shall protect to Varuṇa: sing forth a laud unto the
Kings.  
6 The true, Red Treasure they have sent, one only Son born of the
Three.  
They, the Immortal Ones, never deceived, survey the families of mortal
men.  
7 My songs are lifted up, and acts most splendid are to be performed.  
Come hither, ye Nāsatyas, with accordant mind, to meet and to enjoy my
gifts.  
8 Lords of great wealth, when we invoke your bounty which no demon
checks,  
Both of you, furthering our eastward-offcred praise, come, Chiefs whom
Jamadagni lauds!  
9 Come, Vāyu, drawn by fair hymns, to our sacrifice that reaches
heaven.  
Poured on the middle of the strainingcloth, and cooked, this bright
drink hath been offered ilice.  
10 He comes by straightest paths, as ministering Priest, to taste the
sacrificial gifts.  
Then, Lord of harnessed teams I drink of the twofold draught, bright
Soma mingled with the milk.  
11 Verily, Sūrya, thou art great; truly, Āditya, thou art great.  
As thou art great indeed, thy greatness is admired: yea, verily, thou,
God, art great.  
12 Yea, Sūrya, thou art great in fame thou evermore, O God, art great.  
Thou by thy greatness art the Gods’ High Priest, divine, far-spread
unconquerable light.  
13 She yonder, bending lowly down, clothed in red hues and rich in
rays,  
Is seen, advancing as it were with various tints, amid the ten
surrounding arms.  
14 Past and gone are three mortal generations: the fourth and last into
the Sun hath entered.  
He mid the worlds his lofty place hath taken. Into green plants is gone
the Purifying.  
15 The Rudras' Mother, Daughter of the Vasus, centre of nectar, the
Ādityas’ Sister-  
To folk who understand will 1 proclaim it-injure not Aditi, the Cow, the
sinless.  
16 Weak-minded men have as a cow adopted me who came hither from the
Gods, a Goddess,  
Who, skilled in eloquence, her voice uplifteth, who standeth near at
hand with all devotions.
