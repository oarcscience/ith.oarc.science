### HYMN XXIV. Indra.

1\. A HOME is made for thee to dwell in, Indra: O Much-invoked, go
thitherwith the heroes.  
That thou, to prosper us, mayst be our Helper, vouchsafe us wealth,
rejoice with draughts of Soma.  
2 Indra, thy wish, twice-strong, is comprehended: pressed is the Soma,
poured are pleasant juices.  
This hymn of praise, from loosened tongue, made perfect, draws Indra to
itself with loud invoking.  
3 Come, thou Impetuous; God, from earth or heaven; come to our holy
grass to drink the Soma.  
Hither to me let thy Bay Horses bring thee to listen to our hymns and
make thee joyful.  
4 Come unto us with all thine aids, accordant, Lord of Bay Steeds,
accepting our devotions,  
Fair-helmeted, o’ercoming with the mighty, and lending us the strength
of bulls, O Indra.  
5 As to the chariot pole a vigorous courser, this laud is brought to the
great strong Upholder.  
This hymn solicits wealth of thee: in heaven, as ’twere above the sky,
set thou our glory.  
6 With precious things. O Indra, thus content us: may we attain to thine
exalted favour.  
Send our chiefs plenteous food with hero children. Preserve us evermore,
ye Gods, with blessings.
