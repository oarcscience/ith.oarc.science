### HYMN LXXXVIII. Maruts.

1\. COME hither, Maruts, on your lightning laden cars, sounding with
sweet songs, armed with lances, winged with steeds.  
Fly unto us with noblest food, like birds, O ye of mighty power.  
2 With their red-hued or, haply, tawny coursers which speed their
chariots on, they come for glory.  
Brilliant like gold is he who holds the thunder. Earth have they smitten
with the chariot's felly.  
3 For beauty ye have swords upon your bodies. As they stir woods so may
they stir our spirits.  
For your sake, O ye Maruts very mighty and well-born, have they set the
stone, in motion.  
4 The days went round you and came back O yearners, back, to this prayer
and to this solemn worship.  
The Gotamas making their prayer with singing have pushed the well's lid
up to drink the water.  
5 No hymn way ever known like this aforetime which Gotama sang forth for
you, O Maruts,  
What time upon your golden wheels he saw you, wild boars rushing about
with tusks of iron.  
6 To you this freshening draught of Soma rusheth, O Maruts, like the
voice of one who prayeth.  
It rusheth freely from our hands as these libations wont to flow.
