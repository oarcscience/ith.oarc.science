### HYMN CLIV. Viṣṇu

1\. I WILL declare the mighty deeds of Viṣṇu, of him who measured out
the earthly regions,  
Who propped the highest place of congregation, thrice setting down his
footstep, widely striding.  
2 For this his mighty deed is Viṣṇu lauded, like some wild beast, dread,
prowling, mountain-roaming;  
He within whose three wide-extended paces all living creatures have
their habitation.  
3 Let the hymn lift itself as strength to Viṣṇu, the Bull far-striding,
dwelling on the mountains,  
Him who alone with triple step hath measured this common dwelling-place,
long, far extended.  
4 Him whose three places that are filled with sweetness, imperishable,
joy as it may list them,  
Who verily alone upholds the threefold, the earth, the heaven, and all
living creatures.  
5 May I attain to that his well-loved mansion where men devoted to the
Gods are happy.  
For there springs, close akin to the Wide-Strider, the well of meath in
Viṣṇu's highest footstep.  
6 Fain would we go unto your dwelling-places where there are many-horned
and nimble oxen,  
For mightily, there, shineth down upon us the widely-striding Bull's
sublimest mansion.
