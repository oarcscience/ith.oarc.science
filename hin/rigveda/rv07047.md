Heritage

### HYMN XLVII. Waters.

1\. MAY we obtain this day from you, O Waters, that wave of pure
refreshment, which the pious  
Made erst the special beverage of Indra, bright, stainless, rich in
sweets and dropping fatness.  
2 May the Floods' Offspring, he whose course is rapid, protect that wave
most rich in sweets, O Waters,  
That shall make Indra and the Vasus joyful. This may we gain from you
to-day, we pious.  
3 All-purifying, joying in their nature, to paths of Gods the Goddesses
move onward.  
They never violate the laws of Indra. Present the oil-rich offering to
the Rivers.  
4 Whom Sūrya with his bright beams hath attracted, and Indra dug the
path for them to travel,  
May these Streams give us ample room and freedom. Preserve us evermore,
ye Gods, with blessings.
