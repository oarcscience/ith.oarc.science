### HYMN VII. Agni.

1\. OFFER to Agni, O my friends, your seemly food, your seemly praise;  
To him supremest o’er the folk, the Son of Strength, the mighty Lord:  
2 Him in whose presence, when they meet in full assembly, men rejoice;  
Even him whom worthy ones inflame, and living creatures bring to life.  
3 When we present to him the food and sacrificial gifts of men,  
He by the might of splendour grasps the holy Ordinance's rein.  
4 He gives a signal in the night even to him who is afar,  
When he, the Bright, unchanged by eld, consumes the sovrans of the
wood.  
5 He in whose service on the ways they offer up their drops of sweat,  
On him is their high kin have they mounted, as ridges on the earth.  
6 Whom, sought of many, mortal man hath found to be the Stay of all;  
He who gives flavour to our food, the home of every man that lives.  
7 Even as a herd that crops the grass he shears the field and
wilderness,  
With flashing teeth and beard of gold, deft with his unabated might.  
8 For him, to whom, bright as an axe he, as to Atri, hath flashed
forth,  
Hath the well-bearing Mother borne, producing when her time is come.  
9 Agni to whom the oil is shed by him thou lovest to support,  
Bestow upon these mortals fame and splendour and intelligence.  
10 Such zeal hath he, resistless one: he gained the cattle given by
thee.  
Agni, may Atri overcome the Dasyus who bestow no gifts, subdue the men
who give no food.
