### HYMN CXLVI. Aranyani.

1\. GODDESS of wild and forest who seemest to vanish from the sight.  
How is it that thou seekest not the village? Art thou not afraid?  
2 What time the grasshopper replies and swells the shrill cicala's
voice,  
Seeming to sound with tinkling bells, the Lady of the Wood exults.  
3 And, yonder, cattle seem to graze, what seems a dwelling-place
appears:  
Or else at eve the Lady of the Forest seems to free the wains.  
4 Here one is calling to his cow, another there hath felled a tree:  
At eve the dweller in the wood fancies that somebody hath screamed.  
5 The Goddess never slays, unless some murderous enemy approach.  
Man eats of savoury fruit and then takes, even as he wills, his rest.  
6 Now have I praised the Forest Queen, sweet-scented, redolent of
balm,  
The Mother of all sylvan things, who tills not but hath stores of food.
