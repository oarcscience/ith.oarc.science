### HYMN LIX. Mitra.

1\. MITRA, when speaking, stirreth men to labour: Mitra sustaineth both
the earth and heaven.  
Mitra beholdeth men with eyes that close not. To Mitra bring, with holy
oil, oblation.  
2 Foremost be he who brings thee food, O Mitra, who strives to keep thy
sacred Law, Āditya.  
He whom thou helpest ne’er is slain or conquered, on him, from near or
far, falls no affliction.  
3 joying in sacred food and free from sickness, with knees bent lowly on
the earth's broad surface,  
Following closely the Āditya's statute, may we remain in Mitra's
gracious favour.  
4 Auspicious and adorable, this Mitra was born with fair dominion, King,
Disposer.  
May we enjoy the grace of him the Holy, yea, rest in his propitious
loving-kindness.  
5 The great Āditya, to be served with wor. ship, who stirreth men, is
gracious to the singer.  
To Mitra, him most highly to be lauded, offer in fire oblation that he
loveth.  
6 The gainful grace of Mitra,. God, supporter of the race of man,  
Gives splendour of most.glorious fame.  
7 Mitra whose glory spreads afar, he who in might surpasses heaven,  
Surpasses earth in his renown.  
8 All the Five Races have repaired to Mitra, ever strong to aid,  
For he sustaineth all the Gods.  
9 Mitra to Gods, to living men, to him who strews the holy grass,  
Gives food fulfilling sacred Law.
