### HYMN CXXV. Vāk.

1\. I TRAVEL with the Rudras and the Vasus, with the Ādityas and
All-Gods I wander.  
I hold aloft both Varuṇa and Mitra, Indra and Agni, and the Pair of
Aśvins.  
2 I cherish and sustain high-swelling Soma, and Tvaṣṭar I support,
Pūṣan, and Bhaga.  
I load with wealth the zealous sdcrificer who pours the juice and offers
his oblation  
3 I am the Queen, the gatherer-up of treasures, most thoughtful, first
of those who merit worship.  
Thus Gods have stablished me in many places with many homes to enter and
abide in.  
4 Through me alone all eat the food that feeds them,—each man who sees,
brewhes, hears the word outspoken  
They know it not, but yet they dwell beside me. Hear, one and all, the
truth as I declare it.  
5 1, verily, myself announce and utter the word that Gods and men alike
shall welcome.  
I make the man I love exceeding mighty, make him a sage, a Ṛṣi, and a
Brahman.  
6 I bend the bow for Rudra that his arrow may strike and slay the hater
of devotion.  
I rouse and order battle for the people, and I have penetrated Earth and
Heaven.  
7 On the world's summit I bring forth the Father: my home is in the
waters, in the ocean.  
Thence I extend o’er all existing creatures, and touch even yonder
heaven with my forehead.  
8 I breathe a strong breath like the wind and tempest, the while I hold
together all existence.  
Beyond this wide earth and beyond the heavens I have become so mighty in
my grandeur.
