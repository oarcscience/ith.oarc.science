### HYMN LXXVI. Soma Pavamana.

1\. ON flows the potent juice, sustainer of the heavens, the strength of
Gods, whom men must hail with shouts of joy.  
The Gold-hued, started like a courser by brave men, impetuously winneth
splendour in the streams.  
2 He takes his weapons, like a hero, in his hands, fain to win light,
car-borne, in forays for the kine.  
Indu, while stimulating India's might, is urged forward and balmed by
sages skilful in their task.  
3 Soma, as thou art purified with flowing wave, exhibiting thy strength
enter thou Indra's throat.  
Make both worlds stream for us, as lightning doth the clouds: mete out
exhaustless powers for us, as ’twere through song.  
4 Onward he flows, the King of all that sees the light: the Ṛṣis’ Lord
hath raised the song of sacrifice;  
Even he who is adorned with Sūrya's arrowy beam, Father of hymns, whose
wisdom is beyond our reach.  
5 Like as a bull to herds, thou flowest to the pail, bellowing as a
steer upon the water's lap.  
So, best of Cheerers, thou for Indra flowest on that we, with thy
protection, may o’ercome in fight.
