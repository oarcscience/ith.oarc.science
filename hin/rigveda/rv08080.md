### HYMN LXXX. Indra.

1\. DOWN to the stream a maiden came, and found the Soma by the way.  
Bearing it to her home she said, For Indra will I press thee out, for
Śakra will I press thee out.  
2 Thou roaming yonder, little man, beholding every house in turn,  
Drink thou this Soma pressed with teeth, accompanied with grain and
curds, with cake of meal and song of praise.  
3 Fain would we learn to know thee well, nor yet can we attain to
thee.  
Still slowly and in gradual drops, O Indu, unto Indra flow.  
4 Will he not help and work for us? Will he not make us wealthier?  
Shall we not, hostile to our lord, unite ourselves to Indra now?  
5 O Indra, cause to sprout again three places, these which I declare,—  
My father's head, his cultured field, and this the part below my
waist.  
6 Make all of these grow crops of hair, you cultivated field of ours,  
My body, and my father's head.  
7 Cleansing Apala, Indra! thrice, thou gavest sunlike skin to her,  
Drawn, Śatakratu! through the hole of car, of wagon, and of yoke.
