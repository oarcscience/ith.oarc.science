### HYMN CVI. Viśvedevas.

1\. CALL we for aid on Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa and Agni and the Marut host
and Aditi.  
Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us
from all distress.  
2 Come ye Ādityas for our full prosperity, in conquests of the foe, ye
Gods, bring joy to us.  
Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us
from all distress.  
3 May the most glorious Fathers aid us, and the two Goddesses, Mothers
of the Gods, who strengthen Law.  
Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us
from all distress.  
4 To mighty Narāśaṁsa, strengthening his might, to Pūṣan, ruler over
men, we pray with hymns.  
Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us
from all distress.  
5 Bṛhaspati, make us evermore an easy path: we crave what boon thou hast
for men in rest and stir.  
Like as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us
from all distress.  
6 Sunk in the pit the Ṛṣi Kutsa called, to aid, Indra the Vṛtra-slayer,
Lord of power and might.  
Even as a chariot from a difficult ravine, bountiful Vasus, rescue us
from all distress.  
7 May Aditi the Goddess guard us with the Gods: may the protecting God
keep us with ceaseless care.  
This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu,
Earth and Heaven.
