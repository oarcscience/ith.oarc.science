### HYMN XVI. Indra.

1\. IMPETUOUS, true, let Maghavan come hither, and let his Tawny
Coursers speed to reach us.  
For him have we pressed juice exceeding potent: here, praised with song,
let him effect his visit.  
2 Unyoke, as at thy journey's end, O Hero, to gladden thee today at this
libation.  
Like Uśanā, the priest a laud shall utter, a hymn to thee, the Lord
Divine, who markest.  
3 When the Bull, quaffing, praises our libation, as a sage paying holy
rites in secret,  
Seven singers here from heaven hath he begotten, who e’en by day have
wrought their works while singing.  
4 When heaven's fair light by hymns was made apparent (they made great
splendour shine at break of morning),  
He with his succour, best of Heroes, scattered the blinding darkness so
that men saw clearly.  
5 Indra, Impetuous One, hath waxed immensely: he with his vastness hath
filled earth and heaven.  
E’en beyond this his majesty extendeth who hath exceeded all the worlds
in greatness.  
6 Śakra who knoweth well all human actions hath with his eager Friends
let loose the waters.  
They with their songs cleft e’en the mountain open and willingly
disclosed the stall of cattle.  
7 He smote away the floods' obstructer, Vṛtra; Earth, conscious, lent
her aid to speed thy thunder.  
Thou sentest forth the waters of the ocean, as Lord through power and
might, O daring Hero.  
8 When, Much-invoked! the water's rock thou cleftest, Saramā showed
herself and went before thee.  
Hymned by Aṅgirases, bursting the cow-stalls, much strength thou
foundest for us as our leader.  
9 Come, Maghavan, Friend of Man, to aid the singer imploring thee in
battle for the sunlight.  
Speed him with help in his inspired invokings: down sink the sorcerer,
the prayerless Dasyu.  
10 Come to our home resolved to slay the Dasyu: Kutsa longed eagerly to
win thy friendship.  
Alike in form ye both sate in his dwelling the faithful Lady was in
doubt between you.  
11 Thou comest, fain to succour him, with Kutsa,—a goad that masters
both the Wind-God's horses,  
That, holding the brown steeds like spoil for capture, the sage may on
the final day be present.  
12 For Kutsa, with thy thousand, thou at day-break didst hurl down
greedy Śuṣṇa, foe of harvest.  
Quickly with Kutsa's friend destroy the Dasyus, and roll the
chariot-wheel of Sūrya near us.  
13 Thou to the son of Vidathin, Ṛjiśvan, gavest up mighty Mṛgaya and
Pipru.  
Thou smotest down the swarthy fifty thousand, and rentest forts as age
consumes a garment.  
14 What time thou settest near the Sun thy body, thy form, Immortal One,
is seen expanding:  
Thou a wild elephant with might invested. like a dread lion as thou
wieldest weapons.  
15 Wishes for wealth have gone to Indra, longing for him in war for
light and at libation,  
Eager for glory, labouring with praisesongs: he is like home, like sweet
and fair nutrition.  
16 Call we for you that Indra, prompt to listen, him who hath done so
much for men's advantage;  
Who, Lord of envied bounty, to a singer like me brings quickly booty
worth the capture.  
17 When the sharp-pointed arrow, O thou Hero, flieth mid any conflict of
the people,  
When, Faithful One, the dread encounter cometh, then be thou the
Protector of our body.  
18 Further the holy thoughts of Vamadeva be thou a guileless Friend in
fight for booty.  
We come to thee whose providence protects us: wide be thy sway for ever
for thy singer.  
19 O Indra, with these men who love thee truly, free givers, Maghavan,
in every battle,  
May we rejoice through many autumns, quelling our foes, as days subdue
the nights with splendour.  
20 Now, as the Bhṛgus wrought a car, for Indra the Strong, the Mighty,
we our prayer have fashioned,  
That he may, ne’er withdraw from us his friendship, but be our bodies'
guard and strong defender.  
21 Now, Indra! lauded, glorified with praises, let power swell. high
like rivers for the singer.  
For thee a new hymn, Lord of Bays, is fashioned. May we, car-borne,
through song be victors ever.
