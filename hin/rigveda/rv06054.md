### HYMN LIV. Pūṣan.

1\. O PUSAN, bring us to the man who knows, who shall direct us
straight,  
And say unto us, It is here.  
2 May we go forth with Pūṣan who shall point the houses out to us,  
And say to us, These same are they.  
3 Unharmed is Pūṣan's chariot wheel; the box ne’er falleth to the
ground,  
Nor doth the loosened felIy shake.  
4 Pūṣan forgetteth not the man who serveth him with offered gift:  
That man is first to gather wealth.  
5 May Pūṣan follow near our kine; may Pūṣan keep our horses safe:  
May Pūṣan gather gear for us.  
6 Follow the kine of him who pours libations out and worships thee;  
And ours who sing thee songs of praise.  
7 Let none be lost, none injured, none sink in a pit and break a limb.  
Return with these all safe and sound.  
8 Pūṣan who listens to our prayers, the Strong whose wealth is never
lost,  
The Lord of riches, we implore.  
9 Secure in thy protecting care, O Pūṣan, never may we fail.  
We here are they who sing thy praise.  
10 From out the distance, far and wide, may Pūṣan stretch his right hand
forth,  
And drive our lost again to us.
