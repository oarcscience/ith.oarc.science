### HYMN XXXII. Indra.

1\. LET none, no, not thy worshippers, delay thee far away from us.  
Even from far away come thou unto our feast, or listen if already
here.  
2 For here, like flies on honey, these who pray to thee sit by the juice
that they have poured.  
Wealth-craving singers have on Indra set their hope, as men set foot
upon a car.  
3 Longing for wealth I call on him, the Thunderer with the strong right
hand,  
As a son calleth on his sire.  
4 These Soma juices, mixed with curd, have been expressed for Indra
here.  
Come with thy Bay Steeds, Thunder-wielder, to our home, to drink them
till they make thee glad.  
5 May he whose ear is open hear us. He is asked for wealth: will he
despise our prayer?  
Him who bestows at once a hundred thousand gifts none shall restrain
when he would give.  
6 The hero never checked by men hath gained his strength through Indra,
he  
Who presses out and pours his deep libations forth, O Vṛtra-slayer, unto
thee.  
7 When thou dost drive the fighting men together be, thou Mighty One,
the mighty's shield.  
May we divide the wealth of him whom thou hast slain: bring us,
Unreachable, his goods.  
8 For Indra, Soma-drinker, armed with thunder, press the Soma juice.  
Make ready your dressed meats: cause him to favour us. The Giver blesses
him who gives.  
9 Grudge not, ye Soma pourers; stir you, pay the rites, for wealth, to
the great Conqueror.  
Only the active conquers dwells in peace, and thrives: not for the
niggard are the Gods.  
10 No one hath overturned or stayed the car of him who freely gives.  
The man whom Indra and the Marut host defend comes to a stable full of
kine.  
11 Indra, that man when fighting shall obtain the spoil, whose strong
defender thou wilt be.  
Be thou the gracious helper, Hero I of our cars, be thou the helper of
our men.  
12 His portion is exceeding great like a victorious soldier's spoil.  
Him who is Indra, Lord of Bays, no foes subdue. He gives the Soma-pourer
strength.  
13 Make for the Holy Gods a hymn that is not mean, but well-arranged and
fair of form.  
Even many snares and bonds subdue not him who dwells with Indra through
his sacrifice.  
14 Indra, what mortal will attack the man who hath his wealth in thee?  
The strong will win the spoil on the decisive day through faith in thee,
O Maghavan.  
15 In battles with the foe urge on our mighty ones who give the
treasures dear to thee,  
And may we with our princes, Lord of Tawny Steeds! pass through all
peril, led by thee.  
16 Thine, Indra, is the lowest wealth, thou cherishest the mid-most
wealth,  
Thou ever rulest all the highest: in the fray for cattle none resisteth
thee.  
17 Thou art renowned as giving wealth to every one in all the battles
that are fought.  
Craving protection, all these people of the earth, O Much-invoked,
implore thy name.  
18 If I, O Indra, were the Lord of riches ample as thine own,  
I should support the singer, God. who givest wealth! and not abandon him
to woe.  
19 Each day would I enrich the man who sang my praise, in whatsoever
place he were.  
No kinship is there better, Maghavan, than thine: a father even is no
more.  
20 With Plenty for his true ally the active man will gain the spoil.  
Your Indra, Much-invoked, I bend with song, as bends a wright his wheel
of solid wood.  
21 A moral wins no riches by unworthy praise: wealth comes not to the
niggard churl.  
Light is the task to give, O Maghavan, to one like me on the decisive
day.  
22 Like kine unmilked we call aloud, Hero, to thee, and sing thy
praise,  
Looker on heavenly light, Lord of this moving world, Lord, Indra, of
what moveth not.  
23 None other like to thee, of earth or of the heavens, hath been or
ever will be born.  
Desiring horses, Indra Maghavan! and kine, as men of might we call on
thee.  
24 Bring, Indra, the Victorious Ones; bring, elder thou, the younger
host.  
For, Maghavan, thou art rich in treasures from of old, and must be
called in every fight.  
25 Drive thou away our enemies, O Maghavan: make riches easy to be
won.  
Be thou our good Protector in the strife for spoil: Cherisher of our
friends be thou.  
26 O Indra, give us wisdom as a sire gives wisdom to his sons.  
Guide us, O Much-invoked, in this our way may we still live and look
upon the light.  
27 Grant that no mighty foes, unknown, malevolent, unhallowed, tread us
to the ground.  
With thine assistance, Hero, may we ass through all the waters that are
rul\`ng down.
