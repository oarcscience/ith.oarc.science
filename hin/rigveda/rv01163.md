### HYMN CLXIII. The Horse.

1\. WHAT time, first springing into life, thou neighedst, proceeding
from the sea or upper waters,  
Limbs of the deer hadst thou, and eagle pinions. O Steed, thy birth is
nigh and must be lauded.  
2 This Steed which Yama gave hath Trita harnessed, and him, the first of
all, hath Indra mounted.  
His bridle the Gandharva grasped. O Vasus, from out the Sun ye fashioned
forth the Courser.  
3 Yama art thou, O Horse; thou art Āditya; Trita art thou by secret
operation.  
Thou art divided thoroughly from Soma. They say thou hast three bonds in
heaven  
that hold thee.  
4 Three bonds, they say, thou hast in heaven that bind thee, three in
the waters,  
three within the ocean.  
To me thou seemest Varuṇa, O Courser, there where they say is thy
sublimest birth-place.  
5 Here-, Courser, are the places where they groomed thee, here are the
traces of thy hoofs as winner.  
Here have I seen the auspicious reins that guide thee, which those who
guard the holy Law keep safely.  
6 Thyself from far I recognized in spirit,—a Bird that from below flew
through the heaven.  
I saw thy head still soaring, striving upward by paths unsoiled by dust,
pleasant to travel.  
7 Here I beheld thy form, matchless in glory, eager to win thee food at
the Cow's station.  
Whene’er a man brings thee to thine enjoyment, thou swallowest the
plants most greedy eater.  
8 After thee, Courser, come the car, the bridegroom, the kine come
after, and the charm of maidens.  
Full companies have followed for thy friendship: the pattern of thy
vigour Gods have copied.  
9 Horns made of gold hath he: his feet are iron: less fleet than he,
though swift as thought, is Indra.  
The Gods have come that they may taste the oblation of him who mounted,
first of all, the Courser.  
10 Symmetrical in flank, with rounded haunches, mettled like heroes, the
Celestial Coursers  
Put forth their strength, like swans in lengthened order, when they, the
Steeds, have reached the heavenly causeway.  
11 A body formed for flight hast thou, O Charger; swift as the wind in
motion is thy spirit.  
Thy horns are spread abroad in all directions: they move with restless
beat in wildernesses.  
12 The strong Steed hath come forward to the slaughter, pondering with a
mind directed God-ward.  
The goat who is his kin is led before him the sages and the singers
follow after.  
13 The Steed is come unto the noblest mansion, is come unto his Father
and his Mother.  
This day shall he approach the Gods, most welcome: then he declares good
gifts to him who offers.
