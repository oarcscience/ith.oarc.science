### HYMN XLIV. Dadhikrās.

1\. I CALL on Dadhikrās, the first, to give you aid, the Aśvins, Bhaga,
Dawn, and Agni kindled well,  
Indra, and Viṣṇu, Pūṣan, Brahmaṇaspati, Ādityas, Heaven and Earth, the
Waters, and the Light.  
2 When, rising, to the sacrifice we hasten, awaking Dadhikrās with
adorations.  
Seating on sacred grass the Goddess Iḷā. let us invoke the sage
swift-hearing Aśvins.  
3 While I am thus arousing Dadhikrāvan I speak to Agni, Earth, and Dawn,
and Sūrya,  
The red, the brown of Varuṇa ever mindful: may they ward off from us all
grief and trouble.  
4 Foremost is Dadhikrāvan, vigorous courser; in forefront of the cars,
his way he knoweth,  
Closely allied with Sūrya and with Morning, Ādityas, and Aṅgirases, and
Vasus.  
5 May Dadhikrās prepare the way we travel that we may pass along the
path of Order.  
May Agni bear us, and the Heavenly Army: hear us all Mighty Ones whom
none deceiveth.
