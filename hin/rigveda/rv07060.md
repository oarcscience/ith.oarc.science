### HYMN LX. Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. WHEN thou, O Sun, this day, arising sinless, shalt speak the truth
to Varuṇa and Mitra,  
O Aditi, may all the Deities love us, and thou, O Aryaman, while we are
singing.  
2 Looking on man, O Varuṇa and Mitra, this Sun ascendeth up by both the
pathways,  
Guardian of all things fixt, of all that moveth, beholding good and evil
acts of mortals.  
3 He from their home hath yoked the Seven gold Coursers who, dropping
oil and fatness, carry Sūrya.  
Yours, Varuṇa and Mitra, he surveyeth the worlds and living creatures
like a herdsman.  
4 Your coursers rich in store of sweets have mounted: to the bright
ocean Sūrya hath ascended,  
For whom the Ādityas make his pathway ready, Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa,
accordant.  
5 For these, even Aryaman, Varuṇa and Mitra, are the chastisers of all
guile and falsehood.  
These, Aditi's Sons, infallible and mighty, have waxen in the home of
law Eternal.  
6 These, Mitra, Varuṇa whom none deceiveth, with great power quicken
even the fool to wisdom,  
And, wakening, moreover, thoughtful insight, lead it by easy paths o’er
grief and trouble.  
7 They ever vigilant, with eyes that close not, caring for heaven and
earth, lead on the thoughtless.  
Even in the river's bed there is a shallow. across this broad expanse
may they conduct us.  
8 When Aditi and Varuṇa and Mitra, like guardians, give Sudās their
friendly shelter,  
Granting him sons and lineal succession, let us not, bold ones! move the
Gods to anger.  
9 May he with ofierings purify the altar from any stains of Varuṇa's
reviler.  
Aryaman save us us all those who hate us: give room and freedom to
Sudās, ye Mighty.  
10 Hid from our eyes is their resplendent meeting: by their mysterious
might they hold dominion.  
Heroes! we cry trembling in fear before you, even in the greatness of
your power have mercy.  
11 He who wins favour for his prayer by worship, that he may gain him
strength and highest riches,  
That good man's mind the Mighty Ones will follow: they have brought
comfort to his spacious dwelling.  
12 This priestly task, Gods! Varuṇa and Mitra! hath been performed for
you at sacrifices.  
Convey us safely over every peril. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with
blessings.
