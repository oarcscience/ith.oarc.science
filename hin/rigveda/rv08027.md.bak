### HYMN XXVII. Viśvedevas.

1\. CHEIF Priest is Agni at the laud, as stones and grass at
sacrifice:  
With song I seek the Maruts, Brahmaṇaspati, Gods for help much to be
desired.  
2 I sing to cattle and to Earth, to trees, to Dawns, to Night, to
plants.  
O all ye Vasus, ye possessors of all wealth, be ye the furtherers of our
thoughts.  
3 Forth go, with Agni, to the Gods our sacrifice of ancient use,  
To the Ādityas, Varuṇa whose Law stands fast, and the all-lightening
Marut troop.  
4 Lords of all wealth, may they be strengtheners of man, destroyers of
his enemies.  
Lords of all wealth, do ye, with guards which none may harm, preserve
our dwelling free from foes.  
5 Come to us with one mind to-day, come to us all with one accord,  
Maruts with holy song, and, Goddess Aditi, Mighty One, to our house and
home.  
6 Send us delightful things, ye Maruts, on your steeds: come ye, O
Mitra, to our gifts.  
Let Indra, Varuṇa, and the Ādityas sit, swift Heroes, on our sacred
grass.  
7 We who have trimmed the grass for you, and set the banquet in array,  
And pressed the Soma, call you, Varuina, like men, with sacrificial
fires aflame.  
8 O Maruts, Visinu, Aśvins, Pūṣan, haste away with minds turned
hitherward to Me.  
Let the Strong Indra, famed as Vṛtra's slayer, come first with the
winners of the spoil.  
9 Ye Guileless Gods, bestow on us a refuge strong on every side,  
A sure protection, Vasus, unassailable from near at hand or from afar.  
10 Kinship have I with you, and close alliance O ye Gods, destroyers of
our foes.  
Call us to our prosperity of former days, and soon to new klicity.  
11 For now have I sent forth to you, that I may win a fair reward,  
Lords of all wealth, with homage, this my song of praise. like a
milch-cow that faileth not.  
12 Excellent Savitar hath mounted up on high for you, ye sure and
careful Guides.  
Bipeds and quadrupeds, with several hopes and aims, and birds have
settled to their tasks.  
13 Singing their praise with God-like thought let us invoke each God for
grace,  
Each God to bring you help, each God to strengthen you.  
14 For of one spirit are the Gods with mortal man, co-sharers all of
gracious gifts.  
May they increase our strength hereafter and to-day, providing case and
ample room.  
15 I laud you, O ye Guileless Gods, here where we meet to render
praise.  
None, Varuṇa and Mitra, harins the mortal, man who honours and obeys
your laws.  
16 He makes his house endure, he gathers plenteous food who pays
obedience to your will.  
Born in his sons anew he spreads as Law commands, and prospers every way
unharmed.  
17 E’en without war he gathers wealth, and goes hisway on pleasant
paths,  
Whom Mitra, Varuṇa and Aryaman protect, sharing the gift,of one
accord.  
18 E’en on the plain for him ye make a sloping path, an easy way where
road is none:  
And far away from him the ineffectual shaft must vanish, shot at him in
vain.  
19 If ye appoint the rite to-day, kind Rulers, when the Sun ascends,  
Lords of all wealth, at sunset or at wakingtime, or be it at the noon of
day,  
20 Or, Asuras, when ye have sheltered the worshipper who goes to
sacrifice, at eve  
may we, O Vasus, ye possessors of all wealth, come then into the midst
of You.  
21 If ye to-day at sunrise, or at noon, or in the gloom of eve,  
Lords of all riches, give fair treasure to the man, the wise man who
hath sacrificed,  
22 Then we, imperial Rulers, claim of you this boon, your wide
protection, as a son.  
May we, Ādityas, offering holy gifts, obtain that which shall bring us
greater bliss.
