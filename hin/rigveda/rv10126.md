### HYMN CXXVI. Viśvedevas.

1\. No peril, no severe distress, ye Gods, affects the mortal man,  
Whom Aryaman and Mitra lead, and Varima, of one accord, beyond his
foes.  
2 This very thing do we desire, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,  
Whereby ye guhrd the mortal man from sore distress, and lead him safe
beyond his foes.  
3 These are, each one, our present helps, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman.  
Best leaders, best deliverers to lead us on and bear as safe beyond our
foes.  
4 Ye compass round and guard each man, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman:  
In your dear keeping may we be, ye who are excellent as guides beyond
our foes.  
5 Ādityas are beyond all foes,—Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman:  
Strong Rudra with the Marut host, Indra, Agni let us call for weal
beyond our foes.  
6 These lead us safely over all, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,  
These who are Kings of living men, over all troubles far away beyond our
foes.  
7 May they give bliss to aid us well, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman:  
May the Ādityas, when we pray, grant us wide shelter and defence beyond
our foes.  
8 As in this place, O Holy Ones, ye Vasus freed even the Gaud when her
feet were fettered.  
So free us now from trouble and affliction: and let our life be
lengthened still, O Api.
