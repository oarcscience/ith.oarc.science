### HYMN XL. Viśvedevas.

1\. BE gathered all the audience of the synod: let us begin their praise
whose course is rapid.  
Whate’er God Savitar this day produces, may we be where the Wealthy One
distributes.  
2 This, dealt from heaven ' may both the Worlds vouchsafe us, and
Varuṇa, Indra, Aryaman, and Mitra.  
May Goddess Aditi assign us riches, Vāyu and Bhaga make them ours for
ever.  
3 Strong be the man and full of power, O Maruts, whom ye, borne on by
spotted coursers, favour.  
Him, too, Sarasvatī and Agni further, and there is none to rob him of
his riches.  
4 This Varuṇa is guide of Law, he, Mitra, and Aryaman, the Kings, our
work have finished.  
Divine and foeless Aditi quickly listens. May these deliver us unharmed
from trouble.  
5 With offerings I propitiate the branches of this swift-moving God, the
bounteous Viṣṇu.  
Hence Rudra gained his Rudra-strength: O Aśvins, ye sought the house
that hath celestial viands.  
6 Be not thou angry here, O glowing Pūṣan, for what Varūtrī and the
Bounteous gave us.  
May the swift-moving Gods protect and bless us, and Vāta send us rain,
wha wanders round us.  
7 Now have both worlds been praised by the Vasisthas, and holy Mitra,
Varuṇa, and Agni.  
May they, bright Deities, make our song supremest. Preserve us evermore,
ye Gods, with blessings.
