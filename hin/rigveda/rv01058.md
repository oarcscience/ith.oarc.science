### HYMN LVIII. Agni.

1 NE’ER waxeth faint the Immortal, Son of Strength, since he, the
Herald, hath become Vivasvān's messenger.  
On paths most excellent he measured out mid-air: he with oblation calls
to service of the Gods.  
2 Never decaying, seizing his appropriate food, rapidly, eagerly through
the dry wood he spreads.  
His back, as he is sprinkled, glistens like a horse: loud hath he roared
and shouted like the heights of heaven?  
3 Set high in place o’er all that Vasus, Rudras do, immortal, Lord of
riches, seated as High Priest;  
Hastening like a car to men, to those who live, the God without delay
gives boons to be desired.  
4 Urged by the wind be spreads through dry wood as he lists, armed with
his tongues for sickles, with a mighty roar.  
Black is thy path, Agni, changeless, with glittering waves! when like a
bull thou rushest eager to the trees.  
5 With teeth of flame, wind-driven, through the wood he speeds,
triumphant like a bull among the herd of cows,  
With bright strength roaming to the everlasting air: things fixed,
things moving quake before him as he flies.  
6 The Bhṛgus established thee among mankind for men, like as a treasure,
beauteous, easy to invoke;  
Thee, Agni, as a herald and choice-worthy guest, as an auspicious Friend
to the Celestial Race.  
7 Agni, the seven tongues' deftest Sacrificer, him whom the priests
elect at solemn worship,  
The Herald, messenger of all the Vasus, I serve with dainty food, I ask
for riches.  
8 Grant, Son of Strength, thou rich in friends, a refuge without a flaw
this day to us thy praisers.  
O Agni, Son of Strength, with forts of iron preserve thou from distress
the man who lauds thee.  
9 Be thou a refuge, Bright One, to the singer, a shelter, Bounteous
Lord, to those who worship.  
Preserve the singer from distress, O Agni. May he, enriched with prayer,
come soon and early.
