### HYMN LXI. Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. O VARUNA and Mitra, Sūrya spreading the beauteous light of you Twain
Gods ariseth.  
He who beholdetb all existing creatures observetb well the zeal that is
in mortals.  
2 The holy sage, renowned afar, directeth his hymns to you, O Varuṇa and
Mitra,—  
He whose devotions, sapient Gods, ye favour so that ye fill, as ’twere,
with power his autumns.  
3 From the wide earth, O Varuṇa and Mitra from the great lofty heaven,
ye, Bounteous Givers, -  
Have in the fields and houses set your warder-, who visit every spot and
watch unceasing.  
4 I praise the strength of Varuṇa and Mitra that strength, by
mightiness, keeps both worlds asunder.  
Heroless pass the months of the ungodly he who loves sacrifice makes his
home enduring.  
5 Steers, all infallible are these your people in whom no wondrous thing
is seen, no worship.  
Guile follows close the men who are untruthful: no secrets may be hidden
from your knowledge.  
6 I will exalt your sacrifice with homage: as priest, I, Mitra-Varuṇa,
invoke you.  
May these new hymns and prayers that I have fashioned delight you to the
profit of the singer.  
7 This priestly task, Gods! Varuṇa and Mitra! hath been performed for
you at sacrifices.  
Convey us safely over every peril. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with
blessings.
