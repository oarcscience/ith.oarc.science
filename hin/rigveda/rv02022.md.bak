### HYMN XXII. Indra.

1\. At the Trikadrukas the Great and Strong hath drunk drink blent with
meal. With Viṣṇu hath he quaffed the poured out Soma juice, all that he
would.  
That hath so heightened him the Great, the Wide, to do his mighty
work.  
So may the God attain the God, true Indu Indra who is true.  
2 So he resplendent in the battle overcame Krivi by might. He with his
majesty hath filled the earth and heaven, and waxen strong.  
One share of the libation hath he swallowed down: one share he left.  
So may the God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true.  
3 Brought forth together with wisdom and mighty power thou grewest
great; with hero deeds subduing the malevolent, most swift in act;  
Giving prosperity, and lovely wealth to him who praiseth thee. So may
the God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true.  
4 This, Indra, was thy hero deed, Dancer, thy first and ancient work,
worthy to be told forth in heaven,  
What time thou sentest down life with a God's own power, freeing the
floods.  
All that is godless may he conquer with his might, and, Lord of Hundred
Powers, find for us strength and food.
