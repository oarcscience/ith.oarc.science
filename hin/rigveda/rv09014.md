### HYMN XIV. Soma Pavamana.

1\. REPOSING on the river's wave the Sage hath widely flowed around,  
Bearing the hymn which many love.  
2 When the Five kindred Companies, active in duty, with the song  
Establish him, the Powerful,  
3 Then in his juice whose strength is great, have all the Gods rejoiced
themselves,  
When he hath clothed him in the milk.  
4 Freeing himself he flows away, leaving his body's severed limbs,  
And meets his own Companion here.  
5 He by the daughters of the priest, like a fair youth, hath been
adorned,  
Making the milk, as ’twere, his robe.  
6 O'er the fine fingers, through desire of milk, in winding course he
goes,  
And utters voice which he hath found.  
7 The nimble fingers have approached, adorning him the Lord of
Strength:  
They grasp the vigorous Courser's back.  
8 Comprising all the treasures that are in the heavens and on the
earth,  
Come, Soma, as our faithful Friend.
