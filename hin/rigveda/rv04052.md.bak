### HYMN LII. Dawn.

1\. THIS Lady, giver of delight, after her Sister shining forth,
Daughter of Heaven, hath shown herself.-  
2 Unfailing, Mother of the Kine, in colour like a bright red mare,  
The Dawn became the Aśvins' Friend.  
3 Yea, and thou art the Aśvins' Friend, the Mother of the Kine art
thou:  
O Dawn thou rulest over wealth.  
4 Thinking of thee, O joyous One, as her who driveth hate away,  
We woke to meet thee with our lauds.  
5 Our eyes behold thy blessed rays like troops of cattle loosed to
feed.  
Dawn hath filled full the wide expanse.  
6 When thou hast filled it, Fulgent One! thou layest bare the gloom with
light.  
After thy nature aid us, Dawn.  
7 Thou overspreadest heaven with rays, the dear wide region of
mid-air.  
With thy bright shining lustre, Dawn.
