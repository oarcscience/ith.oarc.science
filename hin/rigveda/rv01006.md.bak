### HYMN VI. Indra.

1 They who stand round him as he moves harness the bright, the ruddy
Steed  
The lights are shining in the sky.  
2 On both sides to the car they yoke the two bay coursers dear to him,  
Bold, tawny, bearers of the Chief.  
3 Thou, making light where no light was, and form, O men: where form was
not,  
Wast born together with the Dawns.  
4 Thereafter they, as is their wont, threw off the state of babes
unborn,  
Assuming sacrificial names.  
5 Thou, Indra, with the Tempest-Gods, the breakers down of what is
firm,  
Foundest the kine even in the cave.  
6 Worshipping even as they list, singers laud him who findeth wealth,  
The far-renowned, the mighty One.  
7 Mayest thou verily be seen coming by fearless Indra's side:  
Both joyous, equal in your sheen.  
8 With Indra's well beloved hosts, the blameless, hastening to heaven,  
The sacrificer cries aloud.  
9 Come from this place, O Wanderer, or downward from the light of
heaven:  
Our songs of praise all yearn for this.  
10 Indra we seek to give us help, from here, from heaven above the
earth,  
Or from the spacious firmament.
