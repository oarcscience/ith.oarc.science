### HYMN XXXIV. Indra.

1\. BOUNDLESS and wasting not, the heavenly food of Gods goes to the
foeless One, doer of wondrous deeds.  
Press out, make ready, offer gifts with special zeal to him whom many
laud, accepter of the prayer.  
2 He who filled full his belly with the Soma's juice, Maghavan, was
delighted with the meath's sweet draught,  
When Uśanā, that he might slay the monstrous beast, gave him the mighty
weapon with a thousand points.  
3 Illustrious is the man whoever presseth out Soma for him in sunshine
or in cloud and rain.  
The mighty Maghavan who is the sage's Friend advanceth more and more his
beauteous progeny.  
4 The Strong God doth not flee away from him whose sire, whose mother or
whose brother he hath done to death.  
He, the Avenger, seeketh this man's offered gifts: this God, the source
of riches, doth not flee from sin.  
5 He seeks no enterprise with five or ten to aid, nor stays with him who
pours no juice though prospering well.  
The Shaker conquers or slays in this way or that, and to the pious gives
a stable full of kine.  
6 Exceeding strong in war he stays the chariot wheel, and, hating him
who pours not, prospers him who pours.  
Indra the terrible, tamer of every man, as Ārya leads away the Dāsa at
his will.  
7 He gathers up for plunder all the niggard’s gear: excellent wealth he
gives to him who offers gifts.  
Not even in wide stronghold may all the folk stand firm who have
provoked to anger his surpassing might.  
8 When Indra Maghavan hath marked two wealthy men fighting for beauteous
cows with all their followers,  
He who stirs all things takes one as his close ally, and, Shaker, with
his Heroes, sends the kine to him.  
9 Agni! I laud the liberal Agnivesi, Satri the type and standard of the
pious.  
May the collected waters yield him plenty, and his be powerful and
bright dominion.
