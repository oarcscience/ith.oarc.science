### HYMN CXLIV. Indra.

1\. THIS deathless Indu, like a steed, strong and of full vitality,  
Belongs to thee, the Orderer.  
2 Here, by us, for the worshipper, is the wise bolt that works with
skill.  
It brings the bubbling beverage as a dexterous man brings the effectual
strong drink.  
3 Impetuous Ahīśuva, a bull among cows of his,  
looked down upon the restless Hawk.  
4 That the strong-pinioned Bird hath brought, Child of the Falcon, from
afar,  
What moves upon a hundred wheels along the female Dragon's path.  
5 Which, fair, unrobbed, the Falcon brought thee in his foot, the
red-hued dwelling of the juice;  
Through this came vital power which lengthens out our days, and kinship
through its help awoke.  
6 So Indra is by lndu's power; e’en among Gods will it repel great
treachery.  
Wisdom, Most Sapient One, brings force that lengthens life. May wisdom
bring the juice to us.
