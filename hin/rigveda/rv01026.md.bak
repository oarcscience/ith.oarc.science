### HYMN XXVI. Agni.

1 O WORTHY of oblation, Lord of prospering powers, assume thy robes,  
And offer this our sacrifice.  
2 Sit ever to be chosen, as our Priest, most youthful, through our
hymns,  
O Agni, through our heavenly word.  
3 For here a Father for his son, Kinsman for kinsman worshippeth,  
And Friend, choice-worthy, for his friend.  
4 Here let the foe-destroyers sit, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,  
Like men, upon our sacred grass.  
5 O ancient Herald, be thou glad in this our rite and fellowship:  
Hearken thou well to these our songs.  
6 Whate’er in this perpetual course we sacrifice to God and God,  
That gift is offered up in thee  
7 May he be our dear household Lord, Priest, pleasant and, choice-worthy
may  
We, with bright fires, be dear to him.  
8 The Gods, adored with brilliant fires. have granted precious wealth to
us  
So, with bright fires, we pray to thee.  
9 And, O Immortal One, so may the eulogies of mortal men  
Belong to us and thee alike.  
10 With all thy fires, O Agni, find pleasure in this our sacrifice,  
And this our speech, O Son of Strength.
