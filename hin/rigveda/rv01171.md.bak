### HYMN CLXXI. Maruts.

1\. To you I come with this mine adoration, and with a hymn I crave the
Strong Ones' favour  
A hymn that truly makes you joyful, Maruts. Suppress your anger and
unyoke your horses.  
2 Maruts, to you this laud with prayer and worship, formed in the mind
and heart, ye Gods, is offered.  
Come ye to us, rejoicing in your spirit, for ye are they who make our
prayer effective.  
3 The Maruts, praised by us, shall show us favour; Maghavan, lauded,
shall be most propitious.  
Maruts,, may all our days that are to follow be very pleasant, lovely
and triumphant.  
4 I fled in [terror](errata.htm#6.md) from this mighty Indra, my body
trembling in alarm, O Maruts.  
Oblations meant for you had been made ready; these have we set aside:
for this forgive us.  
5 By whom the Mānas recognize the day-springs, by whose strength at the
dawn of endless mornings,  
Give us, thou Mighty, glory with Maruts. fierce with the fierce, the
Strong who givest triumph.  
6 Do thou, O Indra, guard the conquering Heroes, and rid thee of thy
wrath against the Maruts,  
With them, the wise, victorious and bestowing. May we find strengthening
food in full abundance.
