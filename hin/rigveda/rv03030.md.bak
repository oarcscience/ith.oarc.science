### HYMN XXX. Indra.

1\. THE friends who offer Soma long to find thee: they pour forth Soma
and present their viands.  
They bear unmoved the cursing of the people, for all our wisdom comes
from thee, O Indra.  
2 Not far for thee are mid-air's loftiest regions: start hither, Lord of
Bays, with thy Bay Horses.  
Made for the Firm and Strong are these libations. The pressing-stones
are set and fire is kindled.  
3 Fair cheeks hath Indra, Maghavan, the Victor, Lord of a great host,
Stormer, strong in action.  
What once thou didst in might when mortals vexed thee,—where now, O
Bull, are those thy hero exploits?  
4 For, overthrowing what hath ne’er been shaken, thou goest forth alone
destroying Vṛtras.  
For him who followeth thy Law the mountains and heaven and earth stand
as if firmly stablished.  
5 Yea, Much-invoked! in safety through thy glories alone thou speakest
truth as Vṛtra's slayer.  
E’en these two boundless worlds to thee, O Indra, what time thou
graspest them, are but a handful.  
6 Forthwith thy Bay steeds down the steep, O Indra, forth, crushing
foemen, go thy bolt of thunder!  
Slay those who meet thee, those who flee, who follow: make all thy
promise true; be all completed.  
7 The man to whom thou givest as Provider enjoys domestic plenty
undivided.  
Blest, Indra, is thy favour dropping fatness: thy worship, Much-invoked!
brings gifts in thousands.  
8 Thou, Indra, Much-invoked! didst crush to pieces Kunaru handless fiend
who dwelt with Danu.  
Thou with might, Indra, smotest dead the scorner, the footless Vṛtra as
he waxed in vigour.  
9 Thou hast established in her seat, O Indra, the level earth, vast,
vigorous, unbounded.  
The Bull hath propped the heaven and air's mid-region. By thee sent
onward let the floods flow hither.  
10 He who withheld the kine, in silence I yielded in fear before thy
blow, O Indra.  
He made paths easy to drive forth the cattle. Loud-breathing praises
helped the Much-invoked One.  
11 Indra alone filled full the earth and heaven, the Pair who meet
together, rich in treasures.  
Yea, bring thou near us from the air's mid-region strength, on thy car,
and wholesome food, O Hero.  
12 Sūrya transgresses not the ordered limits set daily by the Lord of
Tawny Coursers.  
When to the goal he comes, his journey ended, his Steeds he looses: this
is Indra's doing.  
13 Men gladly in the course of night would look on the broad bright
front of the refulgent Morning;  
And all acknowledge, when she comes in glory, the manifold and goodly
works of Indra.  
14 A mighty splendour rests upon her bosom: bearing ripe milk the Cow,
unripe, advances.  
All sweetness is collected in the Heifer, sweetness which Indra made for
our enjoyment.  
15 Barring the way they come. Be firm, O Indra; aid friends to sacrifice
and him who singeth.  
These must be slain by thee, malignant mortals, armed with ill arts, our
quiverbearing foemen.  
16 A cry is beard from enemies most near us: against them send thy
fiercest-flaming weapon.  
Rend them from under, crush them and subdue them. Slay, Maghavan, and
make the fiends our booty.  
17 Root up the race of Rākṣasas, O Indra rend it in front and crush it
in the middle.  
How long hast thou bebaved as one who wavers? Cast thy hot dart at him
who hates devotion:  
18 When borne by strong Steeds for our weal, O Leader, thou seatest thee
at many noble viands.  
May we be winners of abundant riches. May Indra be our wealth with store
of children.  
19 Bestow on us resplendent wealth. O Indra let us enjoy thine overflow
of bounty.  
Wide as a sea our longing hath expanded, fulfil it, O thou Treasure-Lord
of treasures.  
20 With kine and horses satisfy this longing with very splendid bounty
skill extend it.  
Seeking the light, with hymns to thee, O Indra, Kuśikas have brought
their gift, the singers.  
21 Lord of the kine, burst the kine's stable open: cows shall be ours,
and strength that wins the booty.  
Hero, whose might is true, thy home is heaven: to us, O Maghavan, grant
gifts of cattle.  
22 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in this fight where
spoil is gathered,  
The Strong who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras,
wins and gathers riches.
