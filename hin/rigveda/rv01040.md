### HYMN XL. Brahmaṇaspati

1 O BRAHMAṆASPATI, stand up: God-serving men we pray to thee.  
May they who give good gifts, the Maruts, come to us. Indra, most swift,
be thou with them.  
2 O Son of Strength, each mortal calls to thee for aid when spoil of
battle waits for him.  
O Maruts, may this man who loves you well obtain wealth of good steeds
and hero might.  
3 May Brahmaṇaspati draw nigh, may Sūnṛtā the Goddess come,  
And Gods bring to this rite which gives the five-fold gift the Hero,
lover of mankind.  
4 He who bestows a noble guerdon on the priest wins fame that never
shall decay.  
For him we offer sacred hero-giving food, peerless and conquering
easily.  
5 Now Brahmaṇaspati speaks forth aloud the solemn hymn of praise,  
Wherein Indra and Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, the Gods, have made their
dwelling place.  
6 May we in holy synods, Gods! recite that hymn, peerless, that brings
felicity.  
If you, O Heroes, graciously accept this word, may it obtain all bliss
from you.  
7 Who shall approach the pious? who the man whose sacred grass is
trimmed?  
The offerer with his folk advances more and more: he fills his house
with precious things.  
8 He amplifies his lordly might, with kings he slays: e’en mid alarms he
dwells secure  
In great or lesser fight none checks him, none subdues,—the wielder of
the thunderbolt.
