### HYMN XLVII. Indra.

1\. DRINK, Indra, Marut-girt, as Bull, the Soma, for joy, for rapture
even as thou listest.  
Pour down the flood of meath within thy belly: thou from of old art King
of Soma juices.  
2 Indra, accordant, with the banded Maruts, drink Soma, Hero, as wise
Vṛtra-slayer.  
Slay thou our foemen, drive away assailants and make us safe on every
side from danger.  
3 And, drinker at due seasons, drink in season, Indra, with friendly
Gods, our pressed-out Soma.  
The Maruts following, whom thou madest sharers, gave thee the victory,
and thou slewest Vṛtra.  
4 Drink Soma, Indra, banded with the Maruts who, Maghavan, strengthened
thee at Ahi's slaughter,  
'Gainst Śambara, Lord of Bays! in winning cattle, and now rejoice in
thee, the holy Singers.  
5 The Bull whose strength hath waxed, whom Maruts follow, free-giving
Indra, the celestial Ruler,  
Mighty, all-conquering, the victory-giver, him let us call to grant us
new protection.
