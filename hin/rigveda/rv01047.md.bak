### HYMN XLVII. Aśvins.

1 AŚVINS, for you who strengthen Law this sweetest Soma hath been
shed.  
Drink this expressed ere yesterday and give riches to him who offers
it.  
2 Come, O ye Aśvins, mounted on your triple car three-seated, beautiful
of form  
To you at sacrifice the Kaṇvas send the prayer: graciously listen to
their call.  
3 O Aśvins, ye who strengthen Law, drink ye this sweetest Soma juice.  
Borne on your wealth-fraught car come ye this day to him who offers, ye
of wondrous deeds.  
4 Omniscient Aśvins, on the thrice-heaped grass bedew with the sweet
juice the sacrifice.  
The sons of Kaṇva, striving heavenward, call on you with draughts of
Soma juice out-poured.  
5 O Aśvins, with those aids wherewith ye guarded Kaṇva carefully,  
Keep us, O Lords of Splendour: drink the Soma juice, ye strengtheners of
holy law.  
6 O Mighty Ones, ye gave Sudās abundant food, brought on your
treasure-laden car;  
So now vouchsafe to us the wealth which many crave, either from heaven
or from the sea.  
7 Nāsatyas, whether ye be far away or close to Turvaśa,  
Borne on your lightly-rolling chariot come to us, together with the
sunbeams come.  
8 So let your coursers, ornaments of sacrifice, bring you to our
libations here.  
Bestowing food on him who acts and gives aright, sit, Chiefs, upon the
sacred grass.  
9 Come, O Nāsatyas, on your car decked with a sunbright canopy,  
Whereon ye ever bring wealth to the worshipper, to drink the Soma's
pleasant juice.  
10 With lauds and songs of praise we call them down to us, that they,
most rich, may succour us;  
For ye have ever in the Kaṇvas' well-loved house, O Aśvins, drunk the
Soma juice.
