### HYMN III. Agni.

1\. O KING, the potent and terrific envoy, kindled for strength, is
manifest in beauty.  
He shines, all-knowing, with his lotty splendour: chasing black Night he
comes with white-rayed Morning.  
2 Having o’ercome the glimmering Black with beauty, and bringing forth
the dame the Great Sire's Daughter,  
Holding aloft the radiant light of Sūrya, as messenger of heaven he
shines with treasures.  
3 Attendant on the Blessed Dame the Blessed hath come: the Lover
followeth his Sister.  
Agni, far-spreading with conspicuous lustre, hath compassed Night with
whitelyshining garments.  
4 His goings-forth kindle as ’twere high voices the goings of the
auspicious Friend of Agni.  
The rays, the bright beams of the strong-jawed, mighty, adorable Steer
are visible as he cometh.  
5 Whose radiant splendours flow, like sounds, about us, his who is
lofty, brilliant, and effulgent,  
Who reaches heaven with best and brightest lustres, sportive and
piercing even to the summit.  
6 His powers, whose chariot fellies gleam and glitter have loudly roared
while, as with teams, he hasted.  
He, the most Godlike, far-extending envoy, shines with flames ancient,
resonant, whitely-shining.  
7 So bring us ample wealth: seat thee as envoy of the two youthful
Matrons, Earth and Heaven.  
Let Agni rapid with his rapid, horses, impetuous with impetuous Steeds,
come hither.
