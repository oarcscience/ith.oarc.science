### HYMN LIX. Indra-Agni.

1\. I WILL declare, while juices flow, the manly deeds that ye have
done:  
Your Fathers, enemies of Gods, were smitten down, and, Indra-Agni, ye
survive.  
2 Thus, Indra-Agnip verily your greatness merits loftiest praise,  
Sprung from one common Father, brothers, twins are ye; your Mother is in
every place.  
3 These who delight in flowing juice, like fellow horses at their
food,  
Indra and Agni, Gods armed with the thunderbolt, we call this day to
come with help.  
4 Indra and Agni, Friends of Law, served with rich gifts, your speech is
kind  
To him who praises you while these libations flow: that man, O Gods, ye
ne’er consume.  
5 What mortal understands, O Gods, Indra and Agni, this your way?  
One of you, yoking Steeds that move to every side, advances in your
common car.  
6 First, Indra-Agni, hath this Maid come footless unto those with
feet.  
Stretching her head and speaking loudly with her tongue, she hath gone
downward thirty steps.  
7 E’en now, O Indra-Agni, men hold in their arms and stretch their
bows.  
Desert us not in this great fray, in battles for the sake of kine.  
8 The foeman's sinful enmities, Indra and Agni, vex me sore.  
Drive those who hate me far away, and keep them distant from the Sun.  
9 Indra and Agni, yours are all the treasures of the heavens and
earth.  
Here give ye us the opulence that prospers every living man.  
10 O Indra-Agni, who accept the laud, and hear us for our praise,  
Come near us, drawn by all our songs, to drink of this our Soma juice.
