### HYMN I.XXIV. Aśvins.

1\. THESE morning sacrifices call you, Aśvins, at the break of day.  
For help have I invoked you rich in power and might: for, house by house
ye visit all.  
2 O Heroes, ye bestow wonderful nourishment. send it to him whose songs
are sweet  
Accordant, both of you, drive your car down to us, and drink the savoury
Soma juice.  
3 Approach ye and be near to us. drink, O ye Aśvins, of the meath.  
Draw forth the milk, ye Mighty, rich in genuine wealth: injure us not,
and come to us.  
4 The horses that convey you in their rapid flight down to the
worshipper's abode,  
With these your speedy coursers, Heroes, Aśvins, come, ye Gods, come
well-inclined to us.  
5 Yea, verily, our princes seek the Aśvins in pursuit of food.  
These shall give lasting glory to our liberal lords, and, both Nāsatyas,
shelter us.  
6 Those who have led the way, like cars, offending none, those who are
guardians of the men-  
Also through their own might the heroes have grown strong, and dwell in
safe and happy homes.
