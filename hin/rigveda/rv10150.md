Heritage

### HYMN CL. Agni.

1\. THOU, bearer of oblations, though kindled, art kindled for the
Gods.  
With the Ādityas, Rudras, Vasus, come to us: to show us favour come to
us.  
2 Come hither and accept with joy this sacrifice and hymn of ours.  
O kindled God, we mortals are invoking thee, calling on thee to show us
grace.  
3 I laud thee Jātavedas, thee Lord of all blessings, with my song.  
Agni, bring hitherward the Gods whose Laws we love, whose laws we love,
to show us grace.  
4 Agni the God was made the great High-Priest of Gods, Ṛṣis have kindled
Agni, men of mortal mould.  
Agni I invocate for winning ample wealth. kindly disposed for winning
wealth.  
5 Atri and Bharadvāja and Gavisthira, Kaṇva and Trasadasyu, in our fight
he helped.  
On Agni calls Vasiṣṭha, even the household priest, the household priest
to win his grace.
