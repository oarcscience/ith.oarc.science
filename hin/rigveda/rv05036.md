### HYMN XXXVI. Indra.

1\. MAY Indra come to us, he who knows rightly to give forth treasures
from his store of riches.  
Even as a thirsty steer who roams the deserts may he drink eagerly the
milked-out Soma.  
2 Lord of Bay Horses, Hero, may the Soma rise to thy cheeks and jaws
like mountain-ridges.  
May we, O King, as he who driveth coursers, all joy in thee with hymns,
invoked of many!  
3 Invoked of many, Caster of the Stone my heart quakes like a rolling
wheel for fear of penury.  
Shall not Puruvasu the singer give thee praise, O ever-prospering
Maghavan, mounted on thy car?  
4 Like the press-stone is this thy praiser, Indra. Loudly he lifts his
voice with strong endeavour.  
With thy left hand, O Maghavan, give us riches: with thy right, Lord of
Bays, be not reluctant.  
5 May the strong Heaven make thee the Strong wax stronger: Strong, thou
art borne by thy two strong Bay Horses.  
So, fair of cheek, with mighty chariot, mighty, uphold us,
strong-willed, thunderarmed, in battle.  
6 Maruts, let all the people in obeisance bow down before this youthful
Srutaratha,  
Who, rich in steeds, gave me two dark red horses together with three
hundred head of cattle.
