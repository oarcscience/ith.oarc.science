### HYMN X. Agni.

1\. INSTALL at sacrifice, while the rite advances, your pleasant,
heavenly Agni, meet for praises.  
With hymns-for he illumines us-install him. He, Jātavedas, makes our
rites successful.  
2 Hear this laud, Radiant Priest of many aspects, O Agni with the fires
of man enkindled,  
Laud which bards send forth pure as sacred butter, strength to this man,
as ’twere for self-advantage.  
3 Mid mortal men that singer thrives in glory who offers gifts with
hymns of praise to Agni,  
And the God, wondrous bright, with wondrous succours helps him to win a
stable filled with cattle.  
4 He, at his birth, whose path is black behind him, filled heaven and
earth with far-apparent splendour:  
And he himself hath been. through night's thick darkness, made manifest
by light, the Purifier.  
5 With thy most mighty aid, confer, O Agni, wonderful wealth on us and
on our princes,  
Who stand preeminent, surpassing others in liberal gifts, in fame, and
hero virtues.  
6 Agni, accept this sacrifice with gladness, which, seated here, the
worshipper presenteth.  
Fair hymns hadst thou among the Bharadvājas, and holpest them to gain
abundant vigour.  
7 Scatter our foes, increase our store. May we he glad a hundred winters
with brave sons.
