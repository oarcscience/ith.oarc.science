### HYMN XXV. Agni.

1\. I WILL sing near, for grace, your God Agni, for he is good to us.  
Son of the Brands, may he give gifts, and, righteous, save us from the
foe.  
2 For he is true, whom men of old enkindled, and the Gods themselves,  
The Priest with the delicious tongue, rich with the light of glorious
beams.  
3 With wisdom that surpasseth all, with gracious will most excellent,  
O Agni, worthy of our choice, shine wealth on us through hymns of
praise.  
4 Agni is King, for he extends to mortals and to Gods alike.  
Agni is bearer of our gifts. Worship ye Agni with your thoughts.  
5 Agni gives to the worshipper a son, the best, of mightiest fame,  
Of deep devotion, ne’er subdued, bringer of glory to his sire.  
6 Agni bestows the hero-lord who conquers with the men in fight.  
Agni bestows the fleet-foot steed, the victor never overcome.  
7 The mightiest song is Agni's: shine on high, thou who art rich in
light.  
Like the Chief Consort of a King, riches and strength proceed from
thee.  
8 Resplendent are thy rays of light: loud is thy voice like
pressing-stones.  
Yea, of itself thy thunder goes forth like the roaring of the heaven.  
9 Thus, seeking riches, have we paid homage to Agni Conqueror.  
May he, most wise, as with a ship, carry us over all our foes.
