### HYMN X. Agni.

1\. THEE Agni, God, Imperial Lord of all mankind, do mortal men  
With understanding kindle at the sacrifice.  
2 They laud thee in their solemn rites, Agni, as Minister and Priest,  
Shine forth in thine own home as guardian of the Law.  
3 He, verily, who honours thee with fuel, Knower of all life,  
He, Agni! wins heroic might, he prospers well.  
4 Ensign of sacrifices, he, Agni, with Gods is come to us,  
Decked by the seven priests, to him who bringeth gifts.  
5 To Agni, the Invoking Priest, offer your best, your lofty speech,  
To him Ordainer-like who brings the light of songs.  
6 Let these our hymns make Agni grow, whence, meet for laud, he springs
to life,  
To mighty strength and great possession, fair to see.  
7 Best Sacrificer, bring the Gods, O Agni, to the pious man:  
A joyful Priest, thy splendour drive our foes afar  
8 As such, O Purifier, shine on us heroic glorious might:  
Be nearest Friend to those who laud thee, for their weal.  
9 So, wakeful, versed in sacred hymns, the holy singers kindly thee.  
Oblation-bearer, deathless, cherisher of strength.
