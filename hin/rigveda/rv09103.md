### HYMN CIII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. To Soma who is purified as ordering Priest the song is raised:  
Bring meed, as ’twere, to one who makes thee glad with hymns.  
2 Blended with milk and curds he flows on through the long wool of the
sheep.  
The Gold-hued, purified, makes him three seats for rest.  
3 On through the long wool of the sheep to the meath-dropping vat he
flows:  
The Ṛṣis’ sevenfold quire hath sung aloud to him.  
4 Shared by all Gods, Infallible, the Leader of our holy hymns,  
Golden-hued Soma, being cleansed, hath reached the bowls.  
5 After thy Godlike qualities, associate with Indra, go,  
As a Priest purified by priests, Immortal One.  
6 Like a car-horse who shows his strength, a God effused for Deities.  
The penetrating Pavamana flows along.
