Heritage

### HYMN LX. Agni.

1 As ’twere Some goodly treasure Mātariśvan brought, as a gift, the
glorious Priest to Bhṛgu,  
Banner of sacrifice, the good Protector, child of two births, the
swiftly moving envoy.  
2 Both Gods and men obey this Ruler's order, Gods who are worshipped,
men who yearn and worship.  
As Priest he takes his seat ere break of morning, House-Lord, adorable
with men, Ordainer.  
3 May our fair praise, heart-born, most recent, reach him whose tongue,
e’en at his birth, is sweet as honey;  
Whom mortal priests, men, with their strong endeavour, supplied with
dainty viands, have created.  
4 Good to mankind, the yearning Purifier hath among men been placed as
Priest choice-worthy.  
May Agni be our Friend, Lord of the Household, protector of the riches
in the dwelling.  
5 As such we Gotamas with hymns extol thee, O Agni, as the guardian Lord
of riches,  
Decking thee like a horse, the swift prizewinner. May he, enriched with
prayer, come soon and early.
