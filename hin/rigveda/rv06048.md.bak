### HYMN XLVIII. Agni and Others.

1\. SING to your Agni with each song, at every sacrifice, for
strength.  
Come, let us praise the Wise and Everlasting God, even as a well-beloved
Friend,  
2 The Son of Strength; for is he not our gracious Lord? Let us serve him
who bears our gifts.  
In battle may he be our help and strengthener, yea, be the saviour of
our lives.  
3 Agni, thou beamest forth with light, great Hero, never changed by
time.  
Shining, pure Agni! with a light that never fades, beam with thy fair
beams brilliantly.  
4 Thou worshippest great Gods: bring them without delay by wisdom and
thy wondrous power.  
O Agni, make them turn hither to succour us. Give strength, and win it
for thyself.  
5 He whom floods, stones, and trees support, the offspring of eternal
Law;  
He who when rubbed with force is brought to life by men upon the lofty
height of earth;  
6 He who hath filled both worlds fult with his brilliant shine, who
hastens with his smoke to heaven;  
He made himself apparent through the gloom by night, the Red Bull in the
darksome nights, the Red Bull in the darksome nights.  
7 O Agni, with thy lofty beams, with thy pure brilliancy, O God,  
Kindled, Most Youthful One! by Bharadvāja's hand, shine on us, O pure
God, with wealth, shine, Purifier! splendidly.  
8 Thou art the Lord of house and home of all the tribes, O Agni, of all
tribes of men.  
Guard with a hundred forts thy kindler from distress, through hundred
winters, Youngest God! and those who make thy singers rich.  
9 Wonderful, with thy favouring help, send us thy bounties, gracious
Lord.  
Thou art the Charioteer, Agni, of earthly wealth: find rest and safety
for our seed.  
10 With guards unfailing never negligent speed thou our children and our
progeny.  
Keep far from us, O Agni, all celestial wrath and wickedness of godless
men.  
11 Hither, O friends, with newest song drive her who freely pours her
milk;  
Loose her who never turns away;  
12 Who, for the host of Maruts bright with native sheen, hath shed
immortal fame like milk;  
Whom the impetuous Maruts look upon with love, who moves in splendour on
their ways.  
13 For Bharadvāja she poured down in days of old  
The milch-cow yielding milk for all, and food that gives all
nourishment.  
14 Your friend like Indra passing wise, with magic power like Varuṇa.  
Like Aryaman joy-giving, bringing plenteous food like ViSnxu for my
wish, I praise,  
15 Bright as the host of Maruts mighty in their roar. May they bring
Pūṣan free from foes;  
May they bring hither hundreds, thousands for our men: may they bring
hidden stores to light, and make wealth easy to be found.  
16 Haste to me, Pūṣan, in thine car, bright Deity: I fain would speak:  
Most sinful is our foeman's hate.  
17 Tear not up by the roots the Kakambira tree: destroy thou all
malignity.  
Let them not snare by day the neck of that Celestial Bird the Sun.  
18 Uninjured let thy friendship be, like the smooth surface of a skin,  
A flawless skin, containing curds, full to the mouth, containing
curds.  
19 For thou art high above mankind, in glory equal to the Gods.  
Therefore, O Pūṣan, look upon us in the fight: now help us as in days of
old.  
20 May the kind excellence of him the Kind, loud Roarers! be our
guide,  
Be it the God's, O Maruts, or a mortal man's who worships, ye impetuous
Ones!  
21 They whose high glory in a moment like the God, the Sun, goes round
the space of heaven,  
The Maruts have obtained bright strength, a sacred name, strength that
destroys the Vṛtras, strength Vṛtra-destroying excellent.  
22 Once, only once, the heaven was made, once only once, the earth was
formed-  
Once, only Pṛśni's milk was shed: no second, after this, is born.
