### HYMN LVI. Heaven and Earth.

1\. MAY mighty Heaven and Earth, most meet for honour, be present here
with light and gleaming splendours;  
When, fixing them apart, vast, most extensive, the Steer roars loudly in
far-reaching courses.  
2 The Goddesses with Gods, holy with holy, the Two stand pouring out
their rain, exhaustless:  
Faithful and guileless, having Gods for children, leaders of sacrifice
with shining splendours.  
3 Sure in the worlds he was a skilful Craftsman, he who produced these
Twain the Earth and Heaven.  
Wise, with his power he brought both realms, together spacious and deep,
well-fashioned, unsupported.  
4 O Heaven and Earth, with one accord promoting, with high protection as
of Queens, our welfare,  
Far-reaching, universal, holy, guard us. May we, car-borne, through song
be victors ever.  
5 To both of you, O Heaven and Earth, we bring our lofty song of
praise,  
Pure Ones! to glorify you both.  
6 Ye sanctify each other's form, by your own proper might ye rule,  
And from of old observe the Law.  
7 Furthering and fulfilling, ye, O Mighty, perfect Mitra's Law.  
Ye sit around our sacrifice.
