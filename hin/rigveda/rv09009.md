### HYMN IX. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THE Sage of Heaven whose heart is wise, when laid between both hands
and pressed,  
Sends us delightful powers of life.  
2 On, onward to a glorious home; dear to the people void of guile,  
With excellent enjoyment, flow.  
3 He, the bright Son, when born illumed his Parents who had sprung to
life,  
Great Son great Strengtheners of Law.  
4 Urged by the seven devotions he hath stirred the guileless rivers
which  
Have magnified the Single Eye.  
5 These helped to might theYouthful One, high over all, invincible,  
Even Indu, Indra! in thy law.  
6 The immortal Courser, good to draw, looks down upon the Seven: the
fount  
Hath satisfied the Goddesses  
7 Aid us in holy rites, O Man: O Pavamana, drive away  
Dark shades that must be met in fight.  
8 Make the paths ready for a hymn newer and newer evermore:  
Make the lights shine as erst they shone.  
9 Give, Pavamana, high renown, give kine and steeds and hero sons:  
Win for us wisdom, win the light.
