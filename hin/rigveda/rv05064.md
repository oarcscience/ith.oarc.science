### HYMN LX1V. Mitra-Varuṇa

1\. You, foeman-slaying Varuṇa and Mitra, we invoke with song,  
Who, as with penfold of your arms, encompass round the realm of light.  
2 Stretch out your arms with favouring love unto this man who singeth
hymns,  
For in all places is sung forth your evergracious friendliness.  
3 That I may gain a refuge now, may my steps be on Mitra's path.  
Men go protected in the charge of this dear Friend who harms us not.  
4 Mitra and Varuṇa, from you may I, by song, win noblest meed.  
That shall stir envy in the homes of wealthy chiefs and those who
praise.  
5 With your fair splendours, Varuṇa and Mitra, to our gathering come,  
That in their homes the wealthy chiefs and they who are your friends may
thrive.  
6 With those, moreover, among whom ye hold your high supremacy,  
Vouchsafe us room that we may win strength for prosperity and wealth.  
7 When morning flushes, Holy Ones! in the Gods’ realm where white Cows
shine,  
Supporting Arcananas, speed, ye Heroes, with your active feet hither to
my pressed Soma juice.
