### HYMN CXXIV. Dawn.

1\. THE Dawn refulgent when the fire is kindled, and the Sun rising, far
diffuse their brightness.  
Savitar, God, hath sent us forth to labour, each quadruped, each biped,
to be active.  
2 Not interrupting heavenly ordinances, although she minisheth human
generations.  
The last of endless morns that have departed, the first of those that
come, Dawn brightly shineth.  
3 There in the eastern region she, Heaven's Daughter, arrayed in
garments all of light, appeareth.  
Truly she followeth the path of Order, nor faileth, knowing well, the
heavenly quarters.  
4 Near is she seen, as ’twere the Bright One's bosom: she showeth sweet
things like a new song-singer.  
She cometh like a fly awaking sleepers, of all returning dames most true
and constant.  
5 There in the east half of the watery region the Mother of the Cows
hath shown her ensign.  
Wider and wider still she spreadeth onward, and filleth full the laps of
both heir Parents.  
6 She, verily, exceeding vast to look on debarreth from her light nor
kin nor stranger.  
Proud of her spotless form she, brightly shining, turneth not from the
high nor from the humble.  
7 She seeketh men, as she who hath no brother, mounting her car, as
’twere to gather riches.  
Dawn, like a loving matron for her husband, smiling and well attired,
unmasks her beauty.  
8 The Sister quitteth, for the elder Sister, her place, and having
looked on her departeth.  
She decks her beauty, shining forth with sunbeams, like women trooping
to the festal meeting.  
9 To all these Sisters who ere now have vanished a later one each day in
course succeedeth.  
So, like the past, with days of happy fortune, may the new Dawns shine
forth on us with riches.  
10 Rouse up, O Wealthy One, the liberal givers; let niggard traffickers
sleep on unwakened:  
Shine richly, Wealthy One, on those who worship, richly, glad.  
Dawn while wasting, on the singer.  
11 This young Maid from the east hath shone upon us; she harnesseth her
team of bright red oxen.  
She will beam forth, the light will hasten hither, and Agni will be
present in each dwelling.  
12 As the birds fly forth from their resting places, so men with store
of food rise at thy dawning.  
Yea, to the liberal mortal who remaineth at home, O Goddess Dawn, much
good thou bringest.  
13 Praised through my prayer be ye who should be lauded. Ye have
increased our wealth, ye Dawns who love us.  
Goddesses, may we win by your good favour wealth to be told by hundreds
and by thousands.
