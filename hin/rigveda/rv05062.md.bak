### HYMN LXII. Mitra-Varuṇa

1\. BY your high Law firm order is established there where they loose
for travel Sūrya's horses.  
Ten hundred stood together: there I looked on this the most marvellous
Deities' one chief glory.  
2 This, Mitra-Varuṇa, is your special greatness: floods that stood there
they with the days attracted.  
Ye cause to flow all voices of the cowpen: your single chariotfelly hath
rolled hither.  
3 O Mitra-Varuṇa, ye by your greatness, both Kings, have firmly
stablished earth and heaven,  
Ye caused the cows to stream, the plants to flourish, and, scattering
swift drops, sent down the rain-flood.  
4 Let your well-harnessed horses bear you hither: hitherward let them
come with reins drawn tightly.  
A covering cloud of sacred oil attends you, and your streams flow to us
from days aforetime.  
5 To make the lustre wider and more famous, guarding the sacred grass
with veneration,  
Ye, Mitra-Varuṇa, firm, strong, awe-inspiring, are seated on a throne
amid oblations.  
6 With hands that shed no blood, guarding the pious, whom, Varuni3, ye
save amid oblations.  
Ye Twain, together, Kings of willing spirit, uphold dominion based on
thousand pillars.  
7 Adorned with gold, its columns are of iron. in heaven it glitters like
a whip for horses;  
Or stablished on a field deep-spoiled and fruitful. So may we share the
meath that loads your car-seat.  
8 Ye mount your car gold-hued at break of morning, and iron-pillared
when the Sun is setting,  
And from that place, O Varuṇa and Mitra, behold infinity and
limit\~tion.  
9 Bountiful guardians of the world! the shelter that is impenetrable,
strongest, flawless,  
Aid us with that, O Varuṇa and Mitra, and when we long to win may we be
victors.
