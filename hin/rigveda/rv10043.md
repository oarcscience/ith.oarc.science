### HYMN XLIII. Indra.

1\. IN perfect unison all yearning hymns of mine that find the light of
heaven have sung forth Indra's praise.  
As wives embrace their lord, the comely bridegroom, so they compass
Maghavan about that he may help.  
2 Directed unto thee my spirit never strays, for I have set my hopes on
thee, O Much-invoked!  
Sit, Wonderful! as King upon the sacred grass, and let thy
drinking-place be by the Soma juice.  
3 From indigence and hunger Indra turns away: Maghavan hath dominion
over precious wealth.  
These the Seven Rivers flowing on their downward path increase the vital
vigour of the potent Steer.  
4 As on the fair-leafed tree rest birds, to Indra flow the gladdening
Soma juices that the bowls contain.  
Their face that glows with splendour through their mighty power hath
found the shine of heaven for man, the Āryas' light.  
5 As in the game a gambler piles his winnings, so Maghavan, sweeping all
together, gained the Sun  
This mighty deed of thine none other could achieve, none, Maghavan,
before thee, none in recent time.  
6 Maghavan came by turns to all the tribes of men: the Steer took notice
of the people's songs of praise.  
The man in whose libations Śakra hath delight by means of potent Somas
vanquisheth his foes.  
7 When Soma streams together unto Indra flow like waters to the river,
rivulets to the lake,  
In place of sacrifice sages exalt his might, as the rain swells the corn
by moisture sent from heaven.  
8 He rushes through the region like a furious Bull, he who hath made
these floods the dames of worthy lords.  
This Maghavan hath found light for the man who brings oblation, sheds
the juice, and promptly pours his gifts.  
9 Let the keen axe come forth together with the light: here be,.as erst,
the teeming cow of sacrifice.  
Let the Red God shine bright with his refulgent ray, and let the Lord of
heroes glow like heaven's clear sheen.  
10 O Much-invoked, may we subdue all famine and evil want with store of
grain and cattle.  
May we allied, as first in rank, with princes obtain possessions by our
own exertion.  
11 Bṛhaspati protect us from the rearward, and from above, and from
below, from sinners.  
May Indra from the front, and from the centre, as Friend to friends,
vouchsafe us room and freedom.
