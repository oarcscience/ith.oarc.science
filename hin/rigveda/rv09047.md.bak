### HYMN XLVII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. GREAT as he was, Soma hath gained strength by this high solemnity:  
joyous he riseth like a bull.  
2 His task is done: his crushings of the Dasyus are made manifest:  
He sternly reckoneth their debts.  
3 Soon as his song of praise is born, the Soma, Indra's juice, becomes  
A thousand-winning thunderbolt.  
4 Seer and Sustainer, he himself desireth riches for the sage  
When he embellisheth his songs.  
5 Fain would they both win riches as in races of the steeds. In war  
Thou art upon the conquerors' side.
