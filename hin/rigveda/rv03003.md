### HYMN III. Agni.

1\. To him who shines afar, Vaiśvānara, shall bards give precious things
that he may go on certain paths:  
For Agni the Immortal serves the Deities, and therefore never breaks
their everlasting laws.  
2 He, wondrous envoy, goes between the earth and heaven, firm seated as
the Herald, great High Priest of men.  
He compassethwith rays the lofty dwelling-place, Agni, sent forward by
the Gods, enriched with piayer.  
3 Sages shall glorify Agni with earnest thoughts, ensign of sacrifice,
who fills the synod full:  
In whom the singers have stored up their holy acts to him the worshipper
looks for joy and happiness.  
4 The Sire of sacrifice, great God of holy bards, Agni, the measure and
the symbol of the priests,  
Hath entered heaven and earth that show in varied form: the Sage whom
many love rejoiceth in his might.  
5 Bright Agni with the bright car, Lord of green domains, Vaiśvānara
dweller in the floods, who finds the light,  
Pervading, swift and wild, encompassed round with powers, him very
glorious have the Gods established here.  
6 Agni, together with the Gods and Manu's folk by thought extending
sacrifice in varied form,  
Goes, car-borne, to and fro with those who crown each rite, the fleet,
the Household Friend, who turns the curse aside.  
7 Sing, Agni, for long life to us and noble sons: teem thou with plenty,
shine upon us store of food.  
Increase the great man's strength, thou ever-vigilant: thou, longing for
the Gods, knowest their hymns full well.  
8 The Mighty One, Lord of the people and their guest, the leader of
their thoughts, devoted Friend of priests,  
Our solemn rites' announcer, Jātavedas, men with worship ever praise,
with urgings for their weal.  
9 Agni the God resplendent, giver of great joy, hath on his lovely car
compassed the lands with, might.  
Let us with pure laudations in his house approach the high laws of the
nourisher of multitudes.  
10 I celebrate thy glories, O Vaiśvānara, wherewith thou, O farsighted
God, has found the light.  
Thou filledst at thy birth both worlds, the earth and heaven: all this,
O Agni, hast thou compassed of thyself.  
11 By his great skill the Sage alone hath brought to pass a great deed,
mightier than Vaiśvānara's wondrous acts.  
Agni sprang into being, magnifying both his Parents, Heaven and Earth,
rich in prolific seed.
