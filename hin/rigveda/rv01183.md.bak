### HYMN CLXXXIII. Aśvins.

1\. MAKE ready that which passes thought in swiftness, that hath three
wheels and triple seat, ye Mighty,  
Whereon ye seek the dwelling of the pious, whereon, threefold, ye fly
like birds with pinions.  
2 Light rolls your easy chariot faring earthward, what time, for food,
ye, full of wisdom, mount it.  
May this song, wondrous fair, attend your glory: ye, as ye travel, wait
on Dawn Heaven's Daughter.  
3 Ascend your lightly rolling car, approaching the worshipper who turns
him to his duties,—  
Whereon ye come unto the house to quicken man and his offspring, O
Nāsatyas, Heroes.  
4 Let not the wolf, let not the she-wolf harm you. Forsake me not, nor
pass me by or others.  
Here stands your share, here is your hymn, ye Mighty: yours are these
vessels, full of pleasant juices.  
5 Gotama, Purumīlha, Atri bringing oblations all invoke you for
protection.  
Like one who goes straight to the point directed, ye Nāsatyas, to mine
invocation.  
6 We have passed o’er the limit of this darkness: our praise hath been
bestowed on you, O Aśvins.  
Come hitherward by paths which Gods have travelled. May we find
strengthening food in full abundance.
