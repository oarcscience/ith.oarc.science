### HYMN LVII. Indra and Pūṣan.

1\. INDRA and Pūṣan will we call for friend ship and prosperity  
And for the winning of the spoil.  
2 One by the Soma sits to drink juice which the mortar hath expressed:  
The other longs for curd and meal.  
3 Goats are the team that draws the one: the other hath Bay Steeds at
hand;  
With both of these he slays the fiends.  
4 When Indra, wondrous strong, brought down the streams, the mighty
waterfloods,  
Pūṣan was standing by his side.  
5 To this, to Pūṣan's favouring love, and Indra's, may we closely
cling,  
As to a tree's extended bough.  
6 As one who drives a car draws in his reins, may we draw Pūṣan near,  
And Indra, for our great success.
