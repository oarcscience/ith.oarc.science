### HYMN XXXVII. Viśvedevas.

1\. LET your best-bearing car that must be lauded, ne’er injured, bring
you Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans.  
Fill you, fair-helmeted! with mighty Soma, thrice-mixed, at our
libations to delight you.  
2 Ye who behold the light of heaven, Ṛbhukṣans, give our rich patrons
unmolested riches.  
Drink, heavenly-natured. at our sacrifices, and give us bounties for the
hymns we sing you.  
3 For thou, O Bounteous One, art used to giving, at parting treasure
whether small or ample.  
Filled full are both thine arms with great possessions: thy goodness
keeps thee not from granting riches.  
4 Indra, high-famed, as Vāja and Ṛbhukṣans, thou goest working, singing
to the dwelling.  
Lord of Bay Steeds, this day may we Vasisthas offer our prayers to thee
and bring oblations.  
5 Thou winnest swift advancement for thy servant, through hymns, Lord of
Bay Steeds, which thou hast favoured.  
For thee with friendly succour have we battled, and when, O Indra, wilt
thou grant us riches?  
6 To us thy priests a home, as ’twere, thou givest: when, Indra wilt
thou recognize our praises?  
May thy strong Steed, through our ancestral worship, bring food and
wealth with heroes to our dwelling.  
7 Though Nirrti the Goddess reigneth round him, Autumns with food in
plenty come to Indra.  
With three close Friends to length of days he cometh, he whom men let
not rest at home in quiet.  
8 Promise us gifts, O Savitar: may riches come unto us in Parvata's full
bounty.  
May the Celestial Guardian still attend us. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
