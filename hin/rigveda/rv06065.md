### HYMN LXV. Dawn.

1\. SHEDDING her light on human habitations this Child of Heaven hath
called us from our slumber;  
She who at night-time with her argent lustre hath shown herself e’en
through the shades of darkness.  
2 All this with red-rayed steeds have they divided: the Dawns on bright
cars shine in wondrous fashion.  
They, bringing near the stately rite's commencement, drive far away the
night's surrounding shadows.  
3 Dawns, bringing hither, to the man who worships, glory and power and
might and food and vigour,  
Opulent, with imperial sway like heroes, favour your servant and this
day enrich him.  
4 Now is there treasure for the man who serves you, now for the hero,
Dawns! who brings oblation;  
Now for the singer when he sings the praise-song. Even to one like me ye
brought aforetime.  
5 O Dawn who standest on the mountain ridges, Aṅgirases now praise thy
stalls of cattle.  
With prayer and holy hymn they burst them open: the heroes' calling on
the Gods was fruitful.  
6 Shine on us as of old, thou Child of Heaven,on him, rich Maid! who
serves like Bharadvāja.  
Give to the singer wealth with noble heroes, and upon us bestow
wide-spreading glory.
