### HYMN XCV. Agni

1\. To fair goals travel Two unlike in semblance: each in succession
nourishes an infant.  
One bears a Godlike Babe of golden colour; bright and fair-shining, is
he with the other.  
2 Tvaṣṭar's ten daughters, vigilant and youthful, produced this Infant
borne to sundry quarters.  
They bear around him whose long flames are pointed, fulgent among
mankind with native splendour.  
3. Three several places of his birth they honour, in mid-air, in the
heaven, and in the waters.  
Governing in the east of earthly regions, the seasons hath he stablished
in their order.  
4 Who of you knows this secret One? The Infant by his own nature hath
brought forth his Mothers.  
The germ of many, from the waters' bosom he goes forth, wise and great,
of Godlike nature.  
5 Visible, fair, he grows in native brightness uplifted in the lap of
waving waters.  
When he was born both Tvaṣṭar's worlds were frightened: they turn to him
and reverence the Lion.  
6 The Two auspicious Ones, like women, tend him: like lowing cows they
seek him in their manner.  
He is the Lord of Might among the mighty; him, on the right, they balm
with their oblations.  
7 Like Savitar his arms with might he stretches; awful, he strives
grasping the world's two borders.  
He forces out from all a brilliant vesture, yea, from his Mothers draws
he forth new raiment.  
8 He makes him a most noble form of splendour, decking him in his home
with milk and waters.  
The Sage adorns the depths of air with wisdom: this is the meeting where
the Gods are worshipped.  
9 Wide through the firmament spreads forth triumphant the
far-resplendent strength of thee the Mighty.  
Kindled by us do thou preserve us, Agni, with all thy self-bright
undiminished succours.  
10 In dry spots he makes stream, and course, and torrent, and inundates
the earth with floods that glisten.  
All ancient things within his maw he gathers, and moves among the new
fresh-sprouting grasses.  
11 Fed with our fuel, purifying Agni, so blaze to us auspiciously for
glory.  
This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu,
Earth and Heaven.
