### HYMN LXXVII. Agni.

1\. How shall we pay oblation unto Agni? What hymn, Godloved, is said to
him refulgent?  
Who, deathless, true to Law, mid men a herald, bringeth the Gods as best
of sacrificers?  
2 Bring him with reverence hither, most propitious in sacrifices, true
to Law, the herald;  
For Agni, when he seeks the Gods for mortals, knows them full well and
worships them in spirit.  
3 For he is mental power, a man, and perfect; he is the bringer,
friend-like, of the wondrous.  
The pious Āryan tribes at sacrifices address them first to him who doeth
marvels.  
4 May Agni, foe-destroyer, manliest Hero, accept with love our hymns and
our devotion.  
So may the liberal lords whose strength is strongest, urged by their
riches, stir our thoughts with vigour.  
5 Thus Agni Jātavedas, true to Order, hath by the priestly Gotamas been
lauded.  
May he augment in them splendour and vigour: observant, as he lists, he
gathers increase.
