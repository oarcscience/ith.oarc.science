### HYMN LXIII. Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. GUARDIANS of Order, ye whose Laws are ever true, in the sublimest
heaven your chariot ye ascend.  
O Mitra-Varuṇa whomsoe’er ye: favour, here, to him the rain with
sweetness streameth down from heaven.  
2 This world's imperial Kings, O Mitra-Varuṇa, ye rule in holy synod,
looking on the light.  
We pray for rain, your boon, and immortality. Through heaven and over
earth the thunderers take their way.  
3 Imperial Kings, strong, Heroes, Lords of earth and heaven, Mitra and
Varuṇa, ye ever active Ones,  
Ye wait on thunder with the many-tinted clouds, and by the Asura's magic
power cause Heaven to rain.  
4 Your magic, Mitra-Varuṇa, resteth in the heaven. The Sun, the wondrous
weapon, cometh forth as light.  
Ye hide him in the sky with cloud and flood of rain, and water-drops,
Parjanya! full of sweetness flow.  
5 The Maruts yoke their easy car for victory, O Mitra-Varuṇa, as a hero
in the wars.  
The thunderers roam through regions varied in their hues. Imperial
Kings, bedew us with the milk of heaven.  
6 Refreshing is your voice, O Mitra-Varuṇa: Parjanya sendeth out a
wondrous mighty voice.  
With magic power the Maruts clothe them with the clouds. Ye Two cause
Heaven to rain, the red, the spotless One.  
7 Wise, with your Law and through the Asura's magic power ye guard the
ordinances, Mitra-Varuṇa.  
Ye by eternal Order govern all the world. Ye set the Sun in heaven as a
refulgent car.
