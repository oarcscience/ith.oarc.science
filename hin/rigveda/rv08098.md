### HYMN VI. Indra.

1\. INDRA, the poets with. their hymns extol this hero might of thine:  
They strengthened, loud in song, thy power that droppeth oil. With hymns
the Pauras came to thee.  
2 Through piety they came to Indra for his aid, they whose libations
give theejoy.  
As thou with, Krsa and Samvarta hast rejoiced, so, Indra, be thou glad
with us.  
3 Agreeing in your spirit, all ye Deities, come nigh to us.  
Vasus and Rudras shall come near to give us aid, and Maruts listen to
our call.  
4 May Pūṣan, Viṣṇu, and Sarasvatī befriend, and the Seven Streams, this
call of mine:  
May Waters, Wind, the Mountains, and the Forest-Lord, and Earth give ear
unto my cry.  
5 Indra, with thine own bounteous gift, most liberal of the Mighty
Ones,  
Be our boon benefactor, Vṛtra-slayer, be our feast-companion for our
weal.  
6 Leader of heroes, Lord of battle, lead thou us to combat, thou Most
Sapient One.  
High fame is theirs who win by invocations, feasts and entertainment of
the Gods.  
7 Our hopes rest on the Faithful One: in Indra is the people's life.  
O Maghavan, come nigh that thou mayst give us aid: make plenteous food
stream forth for us.  
8 Thee would we worship, Indra, with our songs of praise: O Śatakratu,
be thou ours.  
Pour down upon Praskaṇva bounty vast and firm, exuberant, that shall
never fail.
