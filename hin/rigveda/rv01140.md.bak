### HYMN CXL. Agni.

1\. To splendid Agni seated by the altar, loving well his home, I bring
the food as ’twere his place of birth.  
I clothe the bright One with my hymn as with a robe, him with the car of
light, bright-hued, dispelling gloom.  
2 Child of a double birth he grasps at triple food; in the year's course
what he hath swallowed grows anew.  
He, by another's mouth and tongue a noble Bull, with other, as an
elephant, consumes the trees.  
3 The pair who dwell together, moving in the dark bestir themselves:
both parents hasten to the babe,  
Impetuous-tongued, destroying, springing swiftly forth, one to be
watched and cherished, strengthener of his sire.  
4 For man, thou Friend of men, these steeds of thine are yoked,
impatient, lightly running, ploughing blackened lines,  
Discordant-minded, fleet, gliding with easy speed, urged onward by the
wind and rapid in their course.  
5 Dispelling on their way the horror of black gloom, making a glorious
show these flames of his fly forth,  
When o’er the spacious tract he spreads himself abroad, and rushes
panting on with thunder and with roar.  
6 Amid brown plants he stoops as if adorning them, and rushes bellowing
like a bull upon his wives.  
Proving his might, he decks the glory of his form, and shakes his horns
like one terrific, hard to stay.  
7 Now covered, now displayed he grasps as one who knows his
resting-place in those who know him well.  
A second time they wax and gather Godlike power, and blending both
together change their Parents' form.  
8 The maidens with long, tresses hold him in embrace; dead, they rise up
again to meet the Living One.  
Releasing them from age with a loud roar he comes, filling them with new
spirit, living, unsubdued.  
9 Licking the mantle of the Mother, far and wide he wanders over fields
with beasts that flee apace.  
Strengthening all that walk, licking up all around, a blackened path,
forsooth, he leaves where’er he goes.  
10 O Agni, shine resplendent with our wealthy chiefs, like a
loud-snorting bull, accustomed to the house.  
Thou casting off thine infant wrappings blazest forth as though thou
hadst put on a coat of mail for war.  
11 May this our perfect prayer be dearer unto thee than an imperfect
prayer although it please thee well.  
With the pure brilliancy that radiates from thy form, mayest thou grant
to us abundant store of wealth.  
12 Grant to our chariot, to our house, O Agni, a boat with moving feet
and constant oarage,  
One that may further well our wealthy princes and all the folk, and be
our certain refuge.  
13 Welcome our laud with thine approval, Agni. May earth and heaven and
freely flowing rivers  
Yield us long life and food and corn and cattle, and may the red Dawns
choose for us their choicest.
