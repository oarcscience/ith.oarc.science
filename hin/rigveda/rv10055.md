### HYMN LV. Indra.

1\. FAR is that secret name by which, in terror, the worlds invoked thee
and thou gavest vigour  
The earth and heaven thou settest near each other, and Maghavan, madest
bright thy Brother's Children.  
2 Great is that secret name and far-extending, whereby thou madest all
that is and shall be.  
The Five Tribes whom he loveth well have entered the light he loveth
that was made aforetime.  
3 He filled the heaven and earth and all between them, Gods five times
sevenfold in their proper seasons.  
With four-and-thirty lights he looks around him, lights of one colour
though their ways are divers.  
4 As first among the lights, O Dawn, thou shonest, whereby thou
broughtest forth the Stay of Increase,  
Great art thou, matchless is thine Asura nature, who, high above, art
kin to those beneath thee.  
5 The old hath waked the young Moon from his slumber who runs his
circling course with many round him.  
Behold the Gods’ high wisdom in its greatness: he who died yesterday
to-day is living.  
6 Strong is the Red Bird in his strength, great Hero, who from of old
hath had no nest to dwell in.  
That which he knows is truth and never idle: he wins and gives the
wealth desired of many.  
7 Through these the Thunderer gained strong manly vigour, through whom
he waxed in power to smite down Vṛtra,—  
Who through the might of Indra's operation came forth as Gods in course
of Law and Order.  
8 All-strong, performing works with his companion, All-marking, rapid
Victor, Curse-averter,  
The Hero, waxing, after draughts of Soma, blew far from heaven the
Dasyus with his weapon.
