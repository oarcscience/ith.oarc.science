### HYMN XCV. Urvasi. Purūravas.

1\. Ho there, my consort! Stay, thou fierce-souled lady, and let us
reason for a while together.  
Such thoughts as these of ours, while yet unspoken in days gone by have
never brought us comfort.  
2 What am I now to do with this thy saying? I have gone from thee like
the first of Mornings.  
Purūravas, return thou to thy dwelling: I, like the wind, am difficult
to capture.  
3 Like a shaft sent for glory from the quiver, or swift-steed winning
cattle winning hundreds.  
The lightning seemed to flash, as cowards planned it. The minstrels
bleated like a lamb in trouble.  
4 Giving her husband's father life and riches, from the near dwelling,
when her lover craved her,  
She sought the home wherein she found her pleasure, accepting day and
night her lord's embraces.  
5 Thrice in the day didst thou embrace thy consort, though coldly she
received thy fond caresses.  
To thy desires, Purūravas, I yielded: so wast thou king, O hero, of my
body.  
6 The maids Sujirni, Sreni, Sumne-api, Charanyu, Granthini, and
Hradecaksus,—  
These like red kine have hastened forth, the bright ones, and like
milch-cows have lowed in emulation.  
7 While he was born the Dames sate down together, the Rivers with free
kindness gave him nurture;  
And then, Purūravas, the Gods increased thee for mighty battle, to
destroy the Dasyus.  
8 When I, a mortal, wooed to mine embraces these heavenly nymphs who
laid aside their raiment,  
Like a scared snake they fled from me in terror, like chariot horses
when the car has touched them.  
9 When, loving these Immortal Ones, the mortal hath converse with the
nymphs as they allow him.  
Like swans they show the beauty of their bodies, like horses in their
play they bite and nibble.  
10 She who flashed brilliant as the falling lightning brought me
delicious presents from the waters.  
Now from the flood be born a strong young hero May Uruvasi prolong her
life for ever  
11 Thy birth hath made me drink from earthly milch-kine: this power,
Purūravas, hast thou vouchsafed me.  
I knew, and, warned thee, on that day. Thou wouldst not hear me. What
sayest thou, when naught avails thee?  
12 When will the son be born and seek his father? Mourner-like, will he
weep when first he knows him?  
Who shall divide the accordant wife and husband, while fire is shining
with thy consort's parents?  
13 I will console him when his tears are falling: he shall not weep and
cry for care that blesses.  
That which is thine, between us, will I send thee. Go home again, thou
fool;ṭhou hast not won me.  
14 Thy lover shall flee forth this day for ever, to seek, without
return, the farthest distance.  
Then let his bed be in Destruction's bosom, and there let fierce
rapacious wolves devour him.  
15 Nay, do not die, Purūravas, nor vanish: let not the evil-omened
wolves devour thee.  
With women there can be no lasting friendship: hearts of hyenas are the
hearts of women.  
16 When amid men in altered shape I sojourned, and through four autumns
spent the nights among them,  
I tasted once a day a drop of butter; and even now with that am I am
contented.  
17 I, her best love, call Urvasi to meet me, her who fills air and
measures out the region.  
Let the gift brought by piety approach thee. Turn thou to me again: my
heart is troubled.  
18 Thus speak these Gods to thee, O son of Iḷā: As death hath verily got
thee for his subject,  
Thy sons shall serve the Gods with their oblation, and thou, moreover,
shalt rejoice in Svarga.
