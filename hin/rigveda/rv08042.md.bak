### HYMN XLII Varuṇa.

1\. LORD of all wealth, the Asura propped the heavens, and measured out
the broad earth's wide expanses.  
He, King supreme, approached all living creatures. All these are
Varuṇa's holy operations.  
2 So humbly worship Varuṇa the Mighty revere the wise Guard of World
Immortal.  
May he vouchsafe us triply-barred protection. O Earth and Heaven, within
your lap preserve us.  
3 Sharpen this song of him who strives his utmost, sharpen, God Varuṇa,
his strength and insight;  
May we ascend the ship that bears us safely, whereby we may pass over
all misfortune.  
4 Aśvins, with songs the singer stones have made you hasten
hitherward,  
Nāsatyas, to the Soma-draught. Let all the others die away.  
5 As the sage Atri with his hymns, O Aśvins, called you eagerly,  
Nāsatyas, to the Soma-draught. Let all the others die away.  
6 So have I called you to our aid, even as the wise have called of
old,  
Nāsatyas, to the Soma-draught. Let all the others die away.
