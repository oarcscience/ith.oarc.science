### HYMN LXXI. Soma Pavamana,

1\. THE guerdon is bestowed: the Mighty takes his Seat, and,
ever-Watchful, guards from fiend and evil sprite.  
Gold-hued, he makes the cloud his diadem, the milk his carpet in both
worlds, and prayer his robe of state.  
2 Strong, bellowing, he goes, like one who slays the folk; he lets this
hue of Asuras flow off from him,  
Throws off his covering, seeks his father's meeting-place, and thus
makes for himself the bright robe he assumes.  
3 Onward he flows, from both the hands, pressed out with stones: excited
by the prayer, the water makes him wild.  
He frolics and draws near, completes his work with song, and bathes in
streams to satisfy the worshipper.  
4 They pour out meath around the Master of the house, Celestial
Strengthener of the mountain that gives might;  
In whom, through his great powers, oblation-eating cows in their
uplifted udder mix their choicest milk.  
5 They, the ten sisters, on the lap of Aditi, have sent him forward like
a car from both the arms.  
He wanders and comes near the Cow's mysterious place, even the place
which his inventions have produced.  
6 Like as a falcon to his home, so speeds the God to his own golden
wisely-tashioned place to rest.  
With song they urge the darling to the sacred grass: the Holy One goes
like a courser to the Gods.  
7 From far away, from heaven, the redhued noted Sage, Steer of the
triple height, hath sung unto the kine.  
With thousand guidings he, leading this way and that, shines, as a
singer, splendidly through many a morn.  
8 His covering assumes a radiant hue; where’er he comes into the fight
he drives the foe afar.  
The Winner of the Floods, with food he seeks the host of heaven, he
comes to praises glorified with milk.  
9 Like a bull roaming round the herds he bellows: he hath assumed the
brilliancy of Sūrya.  
Down to the earth hath looked the heavenly Falcon: Soma with wisdom
views all living creatures.
