### HYMN C. Viṣṇu.

1 NE’ER doth the man repent, who, seeking profit, bringeth his gift to
the far-striding Viṣṇu.  
He who adoreth him with all his spirit winneth himself so great a
benefactor.  
2 Thou, Viṣṇu, constant in thy courses, gavest good-will to all men, and
a hymn that lasteth,  
That thou mightst move us to abundant comfort of very splendid wealth
with store of horses.  
3 Three times strode forth this God in all his grandeur over this earth
bright with a hundred splendours.  
Foremost be Viṣṇu, stronger than the strongest: for glorious is his name
who lives for ever.  
4 Over this earth with mighty step strode Viṣṇu, ready to give it for a
home to Manu.  
In him the humble people trust for safety: he, nobly born, hath made
them spacious dwellings.  
5 To-day I laud this name, O gipivista, I, skilled in rules, the name of
thee the Noble.  
Yea, I the poor and weak praise thee the Mighty who dwellest in the
realm beyond this region.  
6 What was there to be blamed in thee, O Viṣṇu, when thou declaredst, I
am Sipivista?  
Hide not this form from us, nor keep it secret, since thou didst wear
another shape in battle.  
7 O Viṣṇu, unto thee my lips cry Vaṣaṭ! Let this mine offering,
Sipivista, please thee.  
May these my songs of eulogy exalt thee. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods,
with blessings.
