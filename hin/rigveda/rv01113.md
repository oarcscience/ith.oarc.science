### HYMN CXIII. Dawn.

1\. This light is come, amid all lights the fairest; born is the
brilliant, far-extending brightness.  
Night, sent away for Savitar's uprising, hath yielded up a birth-place
for the Morning.  
2 The Fair, the Bright is come with her white offspring; to her the Dark
One hath resigned her dwelling.  
Akin, immortal, following each other, changing their colours both the
heavens move onward.  
3 Common, unending is the Sisters' pathway; taught by the Gods,
alternately they travel.  
Fair-formed, of different hues and yet one-minded, Night and Dawn clash
not, neither do they travel.  
4 Bright leader of glad sounds, our eyes behold her; splendid in hue she
hath unclosed the portals.  
She, stirring up the world, hath shown us riches: Dawn hath awakened
every living creature.  
5 Rich Dawn, she sets afoot the coiled-up sleeper, one for enjoyment,
one for wealth or worship,  
Those who saw little for extended vision. All living creatures hath the
Dawn awakened.  
6 One to high sway, one to exalted glory, one to pursue his gain, and
one his labour:  
All to regard their different vocations, all moving creatures hath the
Dawn awakened.  
7 We see her there, the Child of Heaven apparent, the young Maid,
flushing in her shining raiment.  
Thou sovran Lady of all earthly treasure, flush on us here, auspicious
Dawn, this morning.  
8 She first of endless morns to come hereafter, follows the path of
morns that have departed.  
Dawn, at her rising, urges forth the living him who is dead she wakes
not from his slumber.  
9 As thou, Dawn, hast caused Agni to be kindled, and with the Sun's eye
hast revealed creation.  
And hast awakened men to offer worship, thou hast performed, for Gods, a
noble service.  
10 How long a time, and they shall be together,—Dawns that have shone
and Dawns to shine hereafter?  
She yearns for former Dawns with eager longing, and goes forth gladly
shining with the others.  
11 Gone are the men who in the days before us looked on the rising of
the earlier Morning.  
We, we the living, now behold her brightness and they come nigh who
shall hereafter see her.  
12 Foe-chaser, born of Law, the Law's protectress, joy-giver, waker of
all pleasant voices,  
Auspicious, bringing food for Gods’ enjoyment, shine on us here, most
bright, O Dawn, this morning.  
13 From days eternal hath Dawn shone, the Goddess, and shows this light
to-day, endowed with riches.  
So will she shine on days to come immortal she moves on in her own
strength, undecaying.  
14 In the sky's borders hath she shone in splendour: the Goddess hath
thrown off the veil of darkness.  
Awakening the world with purple horses, on her well-harnessed chariot
Dawn approaches.  
15 Bringing all life-sustaining blessings with her, showing herself she
sends forth brilliant lustre.  
Last of the countless mornings that have vanished, first of bright morns
to come hath Dawn arisen.  
16 Arise! the breath, the life, again hath reached us: darkness hath
passed away and light approacheth.  
She for the Sun hath left a path to travel we have arrived where men
prolong existence.  
17 Singing the praises of refulgent Mornings with his hymn's web the
priest, the poet rises.  
Shine then to-day, rich Maid, on him who lauds thee, shine down on us
the gift of life and offspring.  
18 Dawns giving sons all heroes, kine and horses, shining upon the man
who brings oblations,—  
These let the Soma-presser gain when ending his glad songs louder than
the voice of Vāyu.  
19 Mother of Gods, Aditi's form of glory, ensign of sacrifice, shine
forth exalted.  
Rise up, bestowing praise on our devotion all-bounteous, make us chief
among the people.  
20 Whatever splendid wealth the Dawns bring with them to bless the man
who offers praise and worship,  
Even that may Mitra, Varuṇa vouchsafe us, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth
and Heaven.
