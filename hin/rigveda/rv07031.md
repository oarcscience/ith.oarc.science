### HYMN XXXI. Indra.

1\. SING ye a song, to make him glad, to Indra, Lord of Tawny Steeds,  
The Soma-drinker, O my friends.  
2 To him the Bounteous say the laud, and let us glorify, as men May do,
the Giver of true gifts.  
3 O Indra, Lord of boundless might, for us thou winnest strength and
kine,  
Thou winnest gold for us, Good Lord.  
4 Faithful to thee we loudly sing, heroic Indra, songs to thee: Mark, O
Good Lord, this act of ours.  
5 Give us not up to man's reproach, to foeman's hateful calumny: In thee
alone is all my strength.  
6 Thou art mine ample coat of mail, my Champion, Vṛtra-Slayer, thou:  
With thee for Friend I brave the foe.  
7 Yea, great art thou whose conquering might two independent Powers
confess.  
The Heaven, O India, and the Earth.  
8 So let the voice surround thee, which attends the Maruts on their
way,  
Reaching thee with the rays of light.  
9 Let the ascending drops attain to thee, the Wondrous God, in heaven:  
Let all the folk bow down to thee.  
10 Bring to the Wise, the Great, who waxeth mighty, your offerings, and
make ready your devotion;  
To many clans he goeth, man's controller.  
11 For Indra, the sublime, the far-pervading, have singers generated
prayer and praises:  
The sages never violate his statutes.  
12 The choirs have stablished Indra King for ever, for victory, him
whose anger is resistless:  
And, for the Bays' Lord, strengthened those he loveth.
