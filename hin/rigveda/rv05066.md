### HYMN LXVI. Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. O SAPIENT man, call the Two Gods, the very wise, who slay the foe.  
For Varuṇa, whose form is Law, place offerings for his great delight.  
2 For they have won unbroken sway in full perfection, power divine.  
And, like high laws, the world of man hath been made beautiful as
light.  
3 Therefore we praise you that your cars may travel far in front of
ours-  
You who accept the eulogy of Ratahavya with his hymns.  
4 And ye show wMom, Wondrous Gods with fulness of intellIgence.  
By men's discernment are Ve marked, O ye whose might is purified.  
5 This is the Law sublime, O Earth: to aid the Ṛṣis’ toil for fame  
The Two, wide-spreading, are prepared. They come with ample overflow.  
6 Mitra, ye Gods with wandering eyes, would that the worshippers and
we  
Might strive to reach the realm ye rule, most spacious and protected
well,
