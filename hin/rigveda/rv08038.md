### HYMN XXXVIII. Indra-Agni.

1\. YE Twain are Priests of sacrifice, winners in war and holy works:  
Indra and Agni, mark this well.  
2 Ye bounteous riders on the car, ye Vṛtra-slayers unsubdued:  
Indra and Agni, mark this well.  
3 The men with pressing-stones have pressed this meath of yours which
gives delight:  
Indra, and Agni, mark this well.  
4 Accept our sacrifice for weal, sharers of praise! the Soma shed:  
Indra and Agni, Heroes, come.  
5 Be pleased with these libations which attract you to our sacred
gifts  
Indra and Agni, Heroes, come.  
6 Accept this eulogy of mine whose model is the Gāyatrī:  
Indra and Agni, Heroes, Come.  
7 Come with the early-faring Gods, ye who are Lords of genuine wealth:  
Indra-Agni, to the Soma-draught  
8 Hear ye the call of Atris, hear Śyāvāśva as he sheds the juice:  
Indra-Agni to the Soma-draught  
9 Thus have I called you to our aid as sages called on you of old:  
Indra-Agni to the Soma draught!  
10 Indra's and Agni's grace I claim, Sarasvatī's associates  
To whom this psalm of praise is sung.
