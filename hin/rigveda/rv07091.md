### HYMN XCI. Vāyu.

1\. WERE not in sooth, the Gods aforetime blameless, whose pleasure was
increased by adoration?  
For Vāyu and for man in his affliction they caused the Morning to arise
with Sūrya.  
2 Guardians infallible, eager as envoys' preserve us safe through many
months and autumns.  
Addressed to you, our fair praise, Indra-Vāyu, implores your favour and
renewed well-being.  
3 Wise, bright, arranger of his teams, he. seeketh men with rich food
whose treasures are abundant.  
They have arranged them of one mind with Vāyu: the men have wrought all
noble operations.  
4 So far as native power and strength permit you, so far as men behold
whose eyes have vision,  
O ye pure-drinkers, drink with us pure Soma: sit on this sacred grass,
Indra and Vāyu.  
5 Driving down teams that bear the lovely Heroes, hitherward,
Indra-Vāyu, come together.  
To you this prime of savoury juice is offered: here loose your horses
and be friendly-minded.  
6 Your hundred and your thousand teams, O Indra and Vāyu,
all-munificent, which attend you,  
With these most gracious-minded come ye hither, and drink, O Heroes of
the meath we offer.  
7 Like coursers seeking fame will we Vasisthas, O Indra-Vāyu, with our
fair laudations,  
Exerting all our powe-,, call you to aid us. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
