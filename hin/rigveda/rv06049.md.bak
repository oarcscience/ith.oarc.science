### HYMN XLIX. Viśvedevas.

1\. I LAUD with newest songs the Righteous People, Mitra and Varuṇa who
make us happy.  
Let them approach, here let them listen,Agni, Varuṇa, Mitra, Lords of
fair dominion.  
2 Him, to be praised at each tribe's sacrifices, the Two young Matrons'
sober-minded Herald,  
The Son of Strength, the Child of Heaven, the signal of sacrifice, red
Agni will I worship.  
3 Unlike in form are the Red God's two Daughters: one is the Sun's, and
stars bedeck the other.  
Apart, the Sanctifiers, in succession, come to the famed hymn, praised
in holy verses.  
4 I with a lofty song call hither Vāyu, all-bounteous, filler of his
car, most wealthy.  
Thou, Sage, with bright path, Lord of harnessed horses, impetuous,
promptly honourest the prudent.  
5 That chariot of the Aśvins, fair to look on, pleaseth me well, yoked
with a thought, refulgent,  
Wherewith, Nāsatyas, Chiefs, ye seek our dwelling, to give new strength
to us and to our children.  
6 Bulls of the Earth, O Vāta and Parjanya, stir up for us the regions of
the water.  
Hearers of truth, ye, Sages, World-Supporters, increase his living
wealth whose songs delight you.  
7 So may Sarasvatī, the Hero's Consort, brisk with rare life, the
lightning's Child, inspire us,  
And, with the Dames accordant, give the singer a refuge unassailable and
flawless.  
8 I praise with eloquence him who guards all pathways. He, when his love
impelled him, went to Arka.  
May he vouchsafe us gear with gold to grace it: may Pūṣan make each
prayer of ours efective.  
9 May Herald Agni, fulgent, bring for worship Tvaṣṭar adored, in homes
and swift to listen,  
Glorious, first to share, the life-bestower, the ever active God,
fair-armed, fair-handed.  
10 Rudra by day, Rudra at night we honour with these our songs, the
Universe's Father.  
Him great and lofty, blissful, undecaying let us call specially as the
Sage impels us.  
11 Ye who are youthful, wise, and meet for worship, come, Martits, to
the longing of the singer.  
Coming, as erst to Aṅgiras, O Heroes, ye animate and quicken e’en the
desert.  
12 Even as the herdsman driveth home his cattle, I urge my songs to him
the strong swift Hero  
May he, the glorious, lay upon his body the singer's hymns, as stars
bedeck the heaven.  
13 He who for man's behoof in his afiliction thrice measured out the
earthly regions, Viṣṇu-  
When one so great as thou affordeth shelter, may we with wealth and with
ourselves be happy.  
14 Sweet be this song of mine to Ahibudhnya, Parvata, Savitar, with
Floods and Lightnings;  
Sweet, with the Plants, to Gods who seek oblations. May liberal Bhaga
speed us on to riches.  
15 Give riches borne on cars, with many heroes, contenting men, the
guard of mighty Order.  
Give us a lasting home that we may battle with godless bands of men who
fight against us, and meet with tribes to whom the Gods are gracious.
