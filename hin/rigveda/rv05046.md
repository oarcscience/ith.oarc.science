### HYMN XLVI. Viśvedevas.

1\. WELL knowing I have bound me, horselike, to the pole: I carry that
which bears as on and gives us help.  
I seek for no release, no turning back therefrom. May he who knows the
way, the Leader, guide me straight.  
2 O Agni, Indra, Varuṇa, and Mitra, give, O ye Gods, and Marut host, and
Viṣṇu.  
May both Nāsatyas, Rudra, heavenly Matrons, Pūṣan, Sarasvatī, Bhaga,
accept us.  
3 Indra and Agni, Mitra, Varuṇa, Aditi, the Waters, Mountains, Maruts,
Sky, and Earth and Heaven,  
Viṣṇu I call, Pūṣan, and Brahmaṇaspati, and Bhaga, Samsa, Savitar that
they may help.  
4 May Viṣṇu also and Vāta who injures none, and Soma granter of
possessions give us joy;  
And may the Ṛbhus and the Aśvins, Tvaṣṭar and Vibhvan remember us so
that we may have wealth.  
5 So may the band of Maruts dwelling in the sky, the holy, come to us to
sit on sacred grass;  
Bṛhaspati and Pūṣan grant us sure defence, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman guard
and shelter us.  
6 And may the Mountains famed in noble eulogies, and the fair-gleaming
Rivers keep us safe from harm.  
May Bhaga the Dispenser come with power and grace, and far-pervading
Aditi listen to my call.  
7 May the Gods’ Spouses aid us of their own freewill, aid us to
offspring and the winning of the spoil.  
Grant us protection, O ye gracious Goddesses, ye who are on the earth or
in the waters' realm.  
8 May the Dames, wives of Gods, enjoy our presents, Rat, Aśvini, Agnāyī,
and Indrāṇī.  
May Rodasī and Varuṇānī hear us, and Goddesses come at the Matrons'
season.
