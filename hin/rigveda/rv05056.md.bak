### HYMN LVI. Maruts.

1\. AGNI, that valorous company adorned with ornaments of gold,  
The people of the Maruts, I call down to-day even from the luminous
realm of heaven.  
2 Even as thou thinkest in thy heart, thither my wishes also tend.  
Those who have come most near to thine invoking calls, strengthen them
fearful to behold.  
3 Earth, like a bounteous lady, liberal of her gifts, struck down and
shaken, yet exultant, comes to us.  
Impetuous as a bear, O Maruts, is youi rush terrible as a dreadful
bull..  
4 They who with mighty strength o’erthrow like oxen difficult to yoke,  
Cause e’en the heavenly stone to shake ' yea, shake the rocky mountain
as they race along.  
5 Rise up! even now with lauds I call the very numerous company,  
Unequalled, of these Maruts, like a herd of kine, grown up together in
their strength.  
6 Bind to your car the bright red mares, yoke the red coursers to your
car.  
Bind to the pole, to draw, the fleet-foot tawny steeds, the best at
drawing, to the pole.  
7 Yea, and this loudly-neighing bright red vigorous horse who hath been
sutioned, fair to see,  
Let him not cause delay, O Maruts,, in your course, urge ye him onward
in your cars.  
8 The Maruts’ chariot, ever fain to gather glory, we invoke,  
Which Rodasī hath mounted, bringing pleasant gifts, with Maruts in her
company.  
9 I call that brilliant band of yours, adorable, rapid on the car  
Whereon the bounteous Dame, auspicious, nobly born, shows glorious with
the Marut host.
