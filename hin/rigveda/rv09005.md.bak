### HYMN V Āprīs.

1\. ENKINDLED, Pavamana, Lord, sends forth his light on, every side  
In friendly show, the bellowing Bull.  
2 He, Pavamana, Self-produced, speeds onward sharpening his horns:  
He glitters through the firmament.  
3 Brilliant like wealth, adorable, with splendour Pavamana shines,  
Mightily with the streams of meath.  
4 The tawny Pavamana, who strews from of old the grass with might,  
Is worshipped, God amid the Gods.  
5 The golden, the Celestial Doors are lifted with their frames on
high,  
By Pavamana glorified.  
6 With passion Pavamana longs for the great lofty pair, well-formed  
Like beauteous maidens, Night and Dawn  
7 Both Gods who look on men I call, Celestial Heralds: Indra's Self  
Is Pavamana, yea, the Bull.  
8 This, Pavamana's sacrifice, shall the three beauteous Goddesses,  
Sarasvatī and Bhāratī and Iḷā, Mighty One, attend.  
9 1 summon Tvaṣṭar hither, our protector, champion, earliest-born,  
Indu is Indra, tawny Steer; Pavamana is Prajāpati.  
10 O Pavamana, with the meath in streams anoint Vanaspati,  
The ever-green. the golden-hued, refulgent, with a thousand boughs.  
11 Come to the consecrating rite of Pavamana, all ye Gods,—  
Vāyu, Sūrya, Bṛhaspati, Indra, and Agni, in accord.
