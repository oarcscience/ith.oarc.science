### HYMN V. Agni.

1\. BRING forth your song of praise to mighty Agni, the speedy messenger
of earth and heaven,  
Vaiśvānara, who, with those who wake, hath waxen great in the lap of all
the Gods Immortal.  
2 Sought in the heavens, on earth is Agni stablished, leader of rivers,
Bull of standing waters.  
Vaiśvānara when he hath grown in glory, shines on the tribes of men with
light and treasure.  
3 For fear of thee forth fled the dark-hued races, scattered abroad,
deserting their possessions,  
When, glowing, O Vaiśvānara, for Pūru, thou Agni didst light up and rend
their castles.  
4 Agni Vaiśvānara, both Earth and Heaven submit them to thy threefold
jurisdiction.  
Refulgent in thine undecaying lustre thou hast invested both the worlds
with splendour.  
5 Agni, the tawny horses, loudly neighing our resonant hymns that drop
with oil, attend thee;  
Lord of the tribes, our Charioteer of riches, Ensign of days, Vaiśvānara
of mornings.  
6 In thee, O bright as Mitra, Vasus seated the might of Aduras, for they
loved thy spirit.  
Thou dravest Dasyus from their home, O Agni, and broughtest forth broad
light to light the Ārya.  
7 Born in the loftiest heaven thou in a moment reachest, like wind, the
place where Gods inhabit.  
Thou, favouring thine offspring, roaredst loudly when giving life to
creatures, Jātavedas.  
8 Send us that strength, Vaiśvānara, send it, Agni, that strength, O
Jātavedas, full of splendour,  
Wherewith, all-bounteous God, thou pourest riches, as fame
wide-spreading, on the man who offers.  
9 Agni, bestow upon our chiefs and nobles that famous power, that wealth
which feedeth many.  
Accordant with the Vasus and the Rudras, Agni, Vaiśvānara, give us sure
protection.
