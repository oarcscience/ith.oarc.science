### HYMN XLVIII. Vāyu.

1\. TASTE offerings never tasted yet, as bards enjoy the foeman's
wealth.  
O Vāyu, on refulgent car come to the drinking of the juice.  
2 Removing curses, drawn by teams, with Indra, seated by thy side,  
O Vāyu, on refulgent car come to the drinking of the juice.  
3 The two dark treasuries of wealth that wear  
all beauties wait on thee.  
O Vāyu, on refulgent car come to the drinking of the juice.  
4 May nine-and-ninety harnessed steeds who yoke them at thy will bring
thee.  
O Vāyu, on refulgent car come to the drinking of the juice.  
5 Harness, O Vāyu, to thy car a hundred well-fed tawny steeds,  
Yea, or a thousand steeds, and let thy chariot come to us with might.
