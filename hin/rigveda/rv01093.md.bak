### HYMN XCIII. Agni-Soma.

1 AGNI and Soma, mighty Pair, graciously hearken to my call,  
Accept in friendly wise my hymn, and prosper him who offers gifts.  
2 The man who honours you to-day, Agni and Soma, with this hymn,  
Bestow on him heroic strength, increase of kine, and noble steeds.  
3 The man who offers holy oil and burnt oblations unto you,  
Agni and Soma, shall enjoy great strength, with offspring, all his
life.  
4 Agni and Soma, famed is that your. prowess wherewith ye stole the
kine, his food, from Paṇi.  
Ye caused the brood of Bṛsaya to perish; ye found the light, the single
light for many.  
5 Agni and Soma, joined in operation ye have set up the shining lights
in heaven.  
From curse and from reproach, Agni and Soma, ye freed the rivers that
were bound in fetters.  
6 One of you Mātariśvan brought from heaven, the Falcon rent the other
from the mountain.  
Strengthened by holy prayer Agni and Soma have made us ample room for
sacrificing.  
7 Taste, Agni, Soma, this prepared oblation; accept it, Mighty Ones, and
let it please you.  
Vouchsafe us good protection and kind favour: grant to the sacrificer
health and riches.  
8 Whoso with oil and poured oblation honours, with God-devoted heart,
Agni and Soma,—  
Protect his sacrifice, preserve him from distress, grant to the
sacrificer great felicity.  
9 Invoked together, mates in wealth, Agni-Soma, accept our hymns:  
Together be among the Gods.  
10 Agni and Soma, unto him who worships you with holy oil  
Shine forth an ample recompense.  
11 Agni and Soma, be ye pleased with these oblations brought to you,  
And come, together, nigh to us.  
12 Agni and Soma, cherish well our horses, and let our cows be fat who
yield oblations.  
Grant power to us and to our wealthy patrons, and cause our holy rites
to be successful.
