### HYMN XVII. Indra-Varuṇa

1 I CRAVE help from the Imperial Lords, from Indra-Varuṇa; may they  
Both favour one of us like me.  
2 Guardians of men, ye ever come with ready succour at the call  
Of every singer such as I.  
3 Sate you, according to your wish, O Indra-Varuṇa, with wealth:  
Fain would we have you nearest us.  
4 May we be sharers of the powers, sharers of the benevolence  
Of you who give strength bounteously.  
5 Indra and Varuṇa, among givers of thousands, meet for praise,  
Are Powers who merit highest laud.  
6 Through their protection may we gain great store of wealth, and heap
it up  
Enough and still to spare, be ours.  
7 O Indra-Varuṇa, on you for wealth in many a form I call:  
Still keep ye us victorious.  
8 O Indra-Varuṇa, through our songs that seek to win you to ourselves,  
Give us at once your sheltering help.  
9 O Indra-Varuṇa, to you may fair praise which I offer come,  
Joint eulogy which ye dignify.
