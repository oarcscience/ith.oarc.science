### HYMN LVIII. Pūṣan.

1\. LIKE heaven art thou: one form is bright, one holy, like Day and
Night dissimilar in colour.  
All magic powers thou aidest, self-depen. dent! Auspicious be thy bounty
here, O Pūṣan.  
2 Goat-borne, the guard of cattle, he whose home is strength, inspirer
of the hymn, set over all the world;  
Brandishing here and there his lightly. moving goad, beholding every
creature, Pūṣan, God, goes forth.  
3 O Pūṣan, with thy golden ships that travel across the ocean, in the
air's mid-region,  
Thou goest on an embassy to Sūrya, subdued by love, desirous of the
glory.  
4 Near kinsman of the heaven and earth is Pūṣan, liberal, Lord of food,
of wondrous iustre,  
Whom strong and vigorous and swiftlymoving, subdued by love, the Deities
gave to Sūrya.
