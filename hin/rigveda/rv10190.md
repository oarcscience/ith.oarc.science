Heritage

### HYMN CXC. Creation.

1\. FROM Fervour kindled to its height Eternal Law and Truth were
born:  
Thence was the Night produced, and thence the billowy flood of sea
arose.  
2 From that same billowy flood of sea the Year was afterwards
produced,  
Ordainer of the days nights, Lord over all who close the eye.  
3 Dhātar, the great Creator, then formed in due order Sun and Moon.  
He formed in order Heaven and Earth, the regions of the air, and light.
