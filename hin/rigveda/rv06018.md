### HYMN XVIII. Indra.

1\. GLORIFY him whose might is all-surpassing, Indra the much-invoked
who fights uninjured.  
Magnify with these songs the never-vanquished, the Strong, the Bull of
men, the Mighty Victor.  
2 He, Champion, Hero, Warrior, Lord of battles, impetuous, loudly
roaring, great destroyer,  
Who whirls the dust on high, alone, oerthrower, hath made all races of
mankind his subjects.  
3 Thou, thou alone, hast tamed the Dasyus; singly thou hast subdued the
people for the Ārya.  
In this, or is it not, thine hero exploit, Indra? Declare it at the
proper season.  
4 For true, I deem, thy strength is, thine the Mighty, thine, O Most
Potent, thine the Conquering Victor;  
Strong, of the strong, Most Mighty, of the mighty, thine, driver of the
churl to acts of bounty.  
5 Be this our ancient bond of friendship with you and with Aṅgirases
here who speak of Vala.  
Thou, Wondrous, Shaker of things firm, didst smite him in his fresh
strength, and force his doors and castles.  
6 With holy thoughts must he be called, the Mighty, showing his power in
the great fight with Vṛtra.  
He must be called to give us seed and offspring, the Thunderer must he
moved and sped to battle.  
7 He in his might, with name that lives for ever, hath far surpassed all
human generations.  
He, most heroic, hath his home with splendour, with glory and with
riches and with valour.  
8 Stranger to guile, who ne’er was false or faithless, bearing a name
that may be well remembered,  
Indra crushed Cumuri, Dhuni, Śambara, Pipru, and Śuṣṇa, that their
castles fell in ruin.  
9 With saving might that must be praised and lauded, Indra, ascend thy
car to smite down Vṛtra.  
In thy right hand hold fast thy bolt of thunder, and weaken, Bounteous
Lord, his art and magic.  
10 As Agni, as the dart burns the dry forest, like the dread shaft burn
down the fiends, O Indra;  
Thou who with high deep-reaching spear hast broken, hast covered over
mischief and destroyed it.  
11 With wealth, by thousand paths come hither, Agni, paths that bring
ample strength, O thou Most Splendid.  
Come, Son of Strength, o’er whom, Invoked of many! the godless hath no
power to keep thee distant.  
12 From heaven, from earth is bruited forth the greatness of him the
firm, the fiery, the resplendent.  
No foe hath he, no counterpart, no refuge is there from him the
Conqueror full of wisdom  
13 This day the deed that thou hast done is famous, when thou, for him,
with many thousand others  
Laidest low Kutsa, Āyu, Atithigva, and boldly didst deliver Tūrvayāṇa.  
14 In thee, O God, the wisest of the Sages, all Gods were joyful when
thou slewest Ahi.  
When lauded for thyself, thou gavest freedom to sore-afflicted Heaven
and to the people.  
15 This power of thine both heaven and earth acknowledge, the deathless
Gods acknowledge it, O Indra.  
Do what thou ne’er hast done, O Mighty Worker: beget a new hymn at thy
sacrifices.
