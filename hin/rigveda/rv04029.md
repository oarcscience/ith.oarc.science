### HYMN XXIX. Indra.

1\. COME, lauded, unto us with powers and succours, O Indra, with thy
Tawny Steeds; exulting,  
Past even the foeman's manifold libations, glorified with our hymns,
true Wealth-bestower.  
2 Man's Friend, to this our sacrifice he cometh marking how he is called
by Soma-pressers.  
Fearless, and conscious that his Steeds are noble, he joyeth with the
Soma-pouring heroes.  
3 Make his cars hear, that he may show his vigour and may be joyful in
the way he loveth.  
May mighty Indra pouring forth in bounty bestow on us good roads and
perfect safety;  
4 He who with succour comes to his implorer, the singer here who with
his song invites him;  
He who himself sets to the pole swift Coursers, he who hath hundreds,
thousands, Thunder-wielder.  
5 O Indra Maghavan, by thee protected may we be thine, princes and
priests and singers,  
Sharing the riches sent from lofty heaven which yields much food, and
all desire its bounty.
