### HYMN I. Agni.

1 I Laud Agni, the chosen Priest, God, minister of sacrifice,  
The hotar, lavishest of wealth.  
2 Worthy is Agni to be praised by living as by ancient seers.  
He shall bring hitherward the Gods.  
3 Through Agni man obtaineth wealth, yea, plenty waxing day by day,  
Most rich in heroes, glorious.  
4 Agni, the perfect sacrifice which thou encompassest about  
Verily goeth to the Gods.  
5 May Agni, sapient-minded Priest, truthful, most gloriously great,  
The God, come hither with the Gods.  
6 Whatever blessing, Agni, thou wilt grant unto thy worshipper,  
That, Aṅgiras, is indeed thy truth.  
7 To thee, dispeller of the night, O Agni, day by day with prayer  
Bringing thee reverence, we come  
8 Ruler of sacrifices, guard of Law eternal, radiant One,  
Increasing in thine own abode.  
9 Be to us easy of approach, even as a father to his son:  
Agni, be with us for our weal.
