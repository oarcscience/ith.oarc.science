### HYMN XXXVI. Viśvedevas

1\. LET the prayer issue from the seat of Order, for Sūrya with his
beams hath loosed the cattle.  
With lofty ridges earth is far extended, and Agni's flame hath lit the
spacious surface.  
2 O Asuras, O Varuṇa and Mitra, this hymn to you, like food, anew I
offer.  
One of you is a strong unerring Leader, and Mitra, speaking, stirreth
men to labour.  
3 The movements of the gliding wind come hither: like cows, the springs
are filled to overflowing.  
Born in the station e’en of lofty heaven the Bull hath loudly bellowed
in this region.  
4 May I bring hither with my song, O Indra, wise Aryaman who yokes thy
dear Bay Horses,  
Voracious, with thy noble car, O Hero, him who defeats the wrath of the
malicious.  
5 In their own place of sacrifice adorers worship to gain long life and
win his friendship.  
He hath poured food on men when they have praised him; be this, the
dearest reverence, paid to Rudra.  
6 Coming together, glorious, loudly roaring - Sarasvatī, Mother of
Floods, the seventh-  
With copious milk, with fair streams, strongly flowing, full swelling
with the volume of their water;  
7. And may the mighty Maruts, too, rejoicing, aid our devotion and
protect our offspring.  
Let not swift-moving Aksara neglect us: they have increased our own
appropriate riches,  
8 Bring ye the great Aramati before you, and Pūṣan as the Hero of the
synod,  
Bhaga who looks upon this hymn with favour, and, as our strength, the
bountiful Purandbi.  
9 May this our song of praise reach you, O Maruts, and Viṣṇu guardian of
the future infant.  
May they vouchsafe the singer strength for offspring. Preserve us
evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
