### HYMN XIX. Soma Pavamana.

1\. O SOMA, being purified bring us the wondrous treasure, meet  
For lauds, that is in earth and heaven.  
2 For ye Twain, Indra, Soma, are Lords of the light, Lords of the
kine:  
Great Rulers, prosper ye our songs.  
3 The tawny Steer, while cleansed among the living, bellowing on the
grass,  
Hath sunk and settled in his home.  
4 Over the Steer's productive flow the sacred songs were resonant,  
The mothers of the darling Son.  
5 Hath he not, purified, impregned the kine whb long to meet their
Lord,  
The kine who yield the shining milk?  
6 Bring near us those who stand aloof strike fear into our enemies:  
O Pavamana, find us wealth.  
7 Soma, bring down the foeman's might, his vigorous strength and vital
powe'r,  
Whether he be afar or near.
