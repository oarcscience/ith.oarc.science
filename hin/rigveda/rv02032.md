### HYMN XXXII. Various Deities.

1\. GRACIOUSLY further, O ye Heaven and Earth, this speech striving to
win reward, of me your worshipper.  
First rank I give to you, Immortal, high extolled! I, fain to win me
wealth, to you the mighty Pair.  
2 Let not man's guile annoy us, secret or by day: give not us up a prey
to these calamities.  
Sever not thou our friendship: think thereon for us. This, with a heart
that longs for bliss, we seek from thee.  
3 Bring hither with benignant mind the willing Cow teeming with
plenteous milk, full, inexhaustible.  
O thou invoked by many, day by day I urge thee with my word, a charger
rapid in his tread.  
4 With eulogy I call on Rākā swift to hear may she, auspicious, hear us,
and herself observe.  
With never-breaking needle may she sew her work, and give a hero son
most wealthy, meet for praise.  
5 All thy kind thoughts, O Rākā, lovely in their form, wherewith thou
grantest wealth to him who offers gifts—  
With these come thou to us this day benevolent, O Blessed One, bestowing
food of thousand sorts.  
6 O broad-tressed Sinīvālī, thou who art the Sister of the Gods,  
Accept the offered sacrifice, and, Goddess, grant us progeny.  
7 With lovely fingers, lovely arms, prolific Mother of many sons—  
Present the sacred gifts to her, to Sinīvālī Queen of men.  
8 Her, Sinīvālī, her, Gungū, her, Rākā, her, Sarasvatī, Indrāṇī to mine
aid I call, and Varuṇānī for my weal.
