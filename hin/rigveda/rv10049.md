### HYMN XLIX.Indra Vaikuntha.

1\. I HAVE enriched the singer with surpassing wealth; I have allowed
the holy hymn to strengthen me.  
I, furtherer of him who offers sacrifice, have conquered in each fight
the men who worship not.  
2 The People of the heavens, the waters, and the earth have stablished
me among the Gods with Indra's name.  
I took unto myself the two swift vigorous Bays that speed on divers
paths, and the fierce bolt for strength.  
3 With deadly blows I smote Atka for Kavi's sake; I guarded Kutsa well
with these saving helps.  
As Śuṣṇa's slayer I brandished the dart of death: I gave not up the
Āryan name to Dasyu foes.  
4 Smadibha, Tugra, and the Vetasus I gave as prey to Kutsa, father-like,
to succour him.  
I was a worthy King to rule the worshipper, when I gave Tuji dear
inviolable gifts.  
5 I gave up Mṛgaya to Srutarvan as his prey because he ever followed me
and kept my laws.  
For Āyu's sake I caused Veta to bend and bow, and into Savya's hand
delivered Padgrbhi.  
6 1, I crushed Navavāstva of the lofty car, the Dāsa, as the
Vṛtra-slayer kills the fiends;  
When straightway on the region's farthest edge I brought the God who
makes the lights to broaden and increase.  
7 I travel round about borne onward in my might by the fleet-footed
dappled Horses of the Sun.  
When man's libation calls me to the robe of state I soon repel the
powerful Dasyu with my blows.  
8 Stronger am I than Nabus, I who slew the seven: I glorified with might
Yadu and Turvaga.  
I brought another low, with strength I bent his strength: I let the
mighty nine-and-ninety wax in power.  
9 Bull over all the streams that flow along the earth, I took the Seven
Rivers as mine own domain.  
I, gifted with great wisdom, spread the floods abroad: by war I found
for man the way to high success.  
10 I set within these cows the white milk which no God, not even
Tvaṣṭar's self, had there deposited,—  
Much-longed-for, in the breasts, the udders of the kine, the savoury
sweets of meath, the milk and Soma juice.  
11 Even thus hath Indra Maghavan, truly bounteous, sped Gods and men
with mighty operation.  
The pious glorify all these thine exploits, Lord of Bay Coursers,
Strong, and Selfresplendent.
