### HYMN LIX. Indra.

1\. HE who, as Sovran Lord of men, moves with his chariots
unrestrained,  
The Vṛtra-slayer vanquisher, of fighting hosts, preeminent, is praised
with song.  
2 Honour that Indra, Puruhanman! for his aid, in whose sustaining hand
of old,  
The splendid bolt of thunder was deposited, as the great Sun was set in
heaven.  
3 No one by deed attains to him who works and strengthens evermore:  
No, not by sacrifice, to Indra. praised o all, resistless, daring, bold
in might.  
4 The potent Conqueror, invincible in war, him at whose birth the Mighty
Ones,  
The Kine who spread [afar](errata.htm#23), sent their loud voices out,
heavens, earths seat their loud voices out,  
5 O Indra, if a hundred heavens and if a hundred earths were thine—  
No, not a thousand Suns could match thee at thy birth, not both the
worlds, O Thunderer.  
6 Thou, Hero, hast performed thy hero deeds with might, yea, all with
strength, O Strongest One.  
Maghavan, help us to a stable full of kine, O Thunderer, with wondrous
aids.  
7 Let not a godless mortal gain this food, O thou whose life is long!  
But one who yokes the bright-hued steeds, the Etasas, even Indra yoker
of the Bays.  
8 Urge ye the Conqueror to give, your Indra greatly to be praised,  
To be invoked in shallow waters and in depths, to be invoked in deeds of
might.  
9 O Vasu, O thou Hero, raise us up to ample opulence.  
Raise us to gain of mighty wealth, O Maghavan, O Indra, to sublime
renown.  
10 Indra, thou justifiest us, and tramplest down thy slanderers.  
Guard thyself, valiant Hero, in thy vital parts: strike down the Dāsa
with thy blows.  
11 The man who brings no sacrifice, inhuman, godless, infidel,  
Him let his friend the mountain cast to rapid death, the mountain cast
the Dasyu down.  
12 O Mightiest Indra, loving us, gather thou up, as grains of corn,  
Within thine hand, of these their kine, to give away, yea, gather twice
as loving us.  
13 O my companions, wish for power. How may we perfect Sara's praise,  
The liberal princely patron, never to be harmed?  
14 By many a sage whose grass is trimmed thou art continually praised,  
That thou, O Sara, hast bestowed here one and here another calf.  
15 The noble, Suradeva's son, hath brought a calf, led by the car to
three of us.  
As a chief brings a goat to milk.
