### HYMN LXXIX. Agni.

1\. I HAVE beheld the might of this Great Being. Immortal in the midst
of tribes of mortals.  
His jaws now open and now shut together: much they devour, insatiately
chewing.  
2 His eyes are turned away, his head is hidden: unsated with his tongue
he eats the fuel.  
With hands upraised, with reverence in the houses, for him they quickly
bring his food together.  
3 Seeking, as ’twere, his Mother's secret bosom, he, like a child,
creeps on through wide-spread bushes.  
One he finds glowing like hot food made ready, and kissing deep within
the earth's recmes.  
4 This holy Law I tell you, Earth and Heaven: the Infant at his birth
dovours his Parents.  
No knowledge of the God have I, a mortal. Yea, Agni knoweth best, for he
hath wisdom.  
5 This man who quickly gives him food, who offers his gifts of oil and
butter and supports him, -  
Him with his thousand eyes he closely looks on: thou showest him thy
face from all sides, Agni.  
6 Agni, hast thou committed sin or treason among the Gods? In ignorance
I ask thee.  
Playing, not playing, he gold-hued and toothless, hath cut his food up
as the knife a victim.  
7 He born in wood hath yoked his horses rushing in all directions, held
with reins that glitter.  
The well-born friend hath carved his food with Vasus: in all his limbs
he hath increased and prospered.
