### HYMN XXVIII. Indra. Vasukra.

1\. Now all my other friends are here assembled: my Sire-in-law alone
hath not come hither.  
So might he eat the grain and drink the Soma, and, satisfied, return
unto; his dwelling.  
2 Loud belloweth the Bull whose horns are sharpened: upon the height
above earth's breadth he standeth.  
That man I guard and save in all his troubles who fills my flanks when
he hath shed the Soma.  
3 Men with the stone press out for thee, O Indra, strong, gladdening
Soma, and thereof thou drinkest.  
Bulls they dress for thee, and of these thou eatest when, Maghavan, with
food thou art invited.  
4 Resolve for me, O singer, this my riddle: The rivers send their
swelling water backward:  
The fox steals up to the approaching lion: the jackal drives the
wild-boar from the brushwood.  
5 How shall I solve this riddle, I, the simple, declare the thought of
thee the Wise and Mighty?  
Tell us, well knowing, as befits the season: Whitherward is thy
prosperous car advancing?  
6 Thus do they magnify me, me the mighty higher than even high heaven is
my car-pole.  
I all at once demolish many thousands: my Sire begot me with no foe to
match me.  
7 Yea, and the Gods have known me also, Indra, as mighty, fierce and
strong in every exploit.  
Exulting with the bolt I slaughtered Vṛtra, and for the offerer oped
with might the cow-stall.  
8 The Deities approached, they carried axes; splitting the wood they
came with their attendants.  
They laid good timber in the fire-receivers, and burnt the grass up
where they found it growing.  
9 The hare hath swallowed up the opposing razor: I sundered with a clod
the distant mountain.  
The great will I make subject to the little: the calf shall wax in
strength and cat the bullock.  
10 There hath the strong-winged eagle left his talon, as a snared lion
leaves the trap that caught him.  
Even the wild steer in his thirst is captured: the leather strap still
holds his foot entangled.  
11 So may the leather strap their foot entangle who fatten on the viands
of the Brahman.  
They all devour the bulls set free to wander, while they themselves
destroy their bodies' vigour.  
12 They were well occupied with holy duties who sped in person with
their lauds to Soma.  
Speaking like man, mete to us wealth and booty: in heaven thou hast the
name and fame of Hero.
