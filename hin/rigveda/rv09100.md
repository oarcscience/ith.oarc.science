### HYMN C. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THE Guileless Ones are singing praise to Indra's well beloved
Friend,  
As, in the morning of its life, the mothers lick the new-born calf.  
2 O Indu, while they cleanse thee bring, O Soma, doubly-waxing wealth  
Thou in the worshipper's abode causest all treasures to increase.  
3 Set free the. song which mind hath yoked, even as thunder frees the
rain:  
All treasures of the earth and heaven, O Soma, thou dost multiply.  
4 Thy stream when thou art pressed runs on like some victorious
warrior's steed  
Hastening onward through the fleece like a fierce horse who wins the
prize.  
5 Flow on, Sage Soma, with thy stream to give us mental power and
strength,  
Effused for Indra, for his drink, for Mitra and for Varuṇa.  
6 Flow to the filter with thy stream, effused, best winner, thou, of
spoil,  
O Soma, as most rich in sweets for Indra, Viṣṇu, and the Gods.  
7 The mothers, void of guiles, caress thee Golden-coloured, in the
sieve,  
As cows, O Pavamana, lick the new-born calf, as Law commands.  
8 Thou, Pavamana, movest on with wondrous rays to great renown.  
Striving within the votary's house thou drivest all the glooms away.  
9 Lord of great sway, thou liftest thee above the heavens, above the
earth.  
Thou, Pavamana hast assumed thy coat of mail in majesty.
