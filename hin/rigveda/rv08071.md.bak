### HYMN LXXI. Indra.

1\. HASTE forward to us from afar, or, Vṛtra-slayer, from anear,  
To meet the offering to the meath.  
2 Strong are the Soma-draughts; come nigh: the juices fill thee with
delight:  
Drink boldly even as thou art wont'.  
3 Joy, Indra, in the strengthening food et it content thy wish and
thought,  
And be delightful to thine heart.  
4 Come to us thou who hast no foe: we call thee down to hymns of
praise,  
In heaven's sublimest realm of light.  
5 This Soma here expressed with stones and dressed with milk for thy
carouse,  
Indra, is offered up to thee.  
6 Graciously, Indra, hear my call. Come and obtain the draught, and
sate  
Thyself with juices blent with milk.  
7 The Soma, Indra, which is shed in chalices and vats for thee,  
Drink thou, for thou art Lord thereof.  
8 The Soma seen within the vats, as in the flood the Moon is seen,  
Drink thou, for thou art Lord thereof.  
9 That which the Hawk brought in his claw, inviolate, through the air to
thee,  
Drink thou, for thou art Lord thereof.
