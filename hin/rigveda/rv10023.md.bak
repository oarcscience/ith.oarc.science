### HYMN XXIII. Indra.

1\. INDRA, whose right hand wields the bolt, we worship, driver of Bay
Steeds seeking sundered courses.  
Shaking his beard with might he hath arisen, casting his weapons forth
and dealing bounties.  
2 The treasure which his Bay Steeds found at sacrifice,—this wealth made
opulent Indra slayer of the foe.  
Ṛbhu, Ṛbhukṣan, Vāja-he is Lord of Might. The Dāsa's very name I utterly
destroy.  
3 When, with the Princes, Maghavari, famed of old, comes nigh the
thunderbolt of gold, and the Controller's car  
Which his two Tawny Coursers draw, then Indra is the Sovran Lord of
power whose glory spreads afar.  
4 With him too is this rain of his that comes like herds: Indra throws
drops of moisture on his yellow beard.  
When the sweet juice is shed he seeks the pleasant place, and stirs the
worshipper as wind disturbs the wood.  
5 We laud and praise his several deeds of valour who, fatherlike, with
power hath made us stronger;  
Who with his voice slew many thousand wicked ones who spake in varied
manners with contemptuous cries.  
6 Indra, the Vimadas have formed for thee a laud, copious, unparalleled,
for thee Most Bountiful.  
We know the good we gain from him the Mighty One when we attract him as
a herdsman calls the kine.  
7 Ne’er may this bond of friendship be dissevered, the Ṛṣi Vimada's and
thine, O Indra.  
We know thou carest for us as a brother with us, O God, be thine
auspicious friendship.
