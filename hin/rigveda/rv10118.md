### HYMN CXVIII. Agni.

1\. AGNI, refulgent among men thou slayest the devouring fiend,  
Bright Ruler in thine own abode.  
2 Thou springest up when worshipped well the drops of butter are thy
joy  
When ladies are brought near to thee.  
3 Honoured with gifts he shines afar, Agni adorable with song:  
The dripping ladle balms his face.  
4 Agni with honey in his mouth, honoured with gifts, is balmed with
oil,  
Refulgent in his wealth of light.  
5 Praised by our hymns thou kindlest thee, Oblation-bearer, for the
Gods  
As such do mortals call on thee.  
6 To that Immortal Agni pay worship with oil, ye mortal men,—  
Lord of the house, whom none deceives.  
7 O Agni, burn the Rākṣasas with thine unconquerable flame  
Shine guardian of Eternal Law.  
8 So, Agni, with thy glowing face burn fierce against the female
fiends,  
Shining among Uruksayas.  
9 Uruksayas have kindled thee, Oblation-bearer, thee, with hymns.  
Best Worshipper among mankind.
