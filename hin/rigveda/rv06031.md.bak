### HYMN XXXI Indra.

1\. SOLE Lord of wealth art thou, O Lord of riches: thou in thine hands
hast held the people, Indra!  
Men have invoked thee with contending voices for seed and waters,
progeny and sunlight.  
2 Through fear of thee, O Indra, all the regions of earth, though naught
may move them, shake and tremble.  
All that is firm is frightened at thy coming, -the earth, the heaven,
the mountain, and the forest.  
3 With Kutsa, Indra! thou didst conquer Śuṣṇa, voracious, bane of crops,
in fight for cattle.  
In the close fray thou rentest him: thou stolest the Sun's wheel and
didst drive away misfortunes.  
4 Thou smotest to the ground the hundred castles, impregnable, of
Śambara the Dasyu,  
When, Strong, with might thou holpest Divodāsa who poured libations out,
O Soma-buyer, and madest Bharadvāja rich who praised thee.  
5 As such, true Hero, for great joy of battle mount thy terrific car, O
Brave and Manly.  
Come with thine help to me, thou distant Roamer, and, glorious God,
spread among men my glory.
