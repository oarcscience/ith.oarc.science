### HYMN XXXVIII. Indra.

1\. HASTING like some strong courser good at drawing, a thought have I
imagined like a workman.  
Pondering what is dearest and most noble, I long to see the sages full
of wisdom.  
2 Ask of the sages' mighty generations firm-minded and devout they
framed the heaven.  
These are thy heart-sought strengthening directions, and they have come
to be sky's upholders.  
3 Assuming in this world mysterious natures, they decked the heaven and
earth for high dominion,  
Measured with measures, fixed their broad expanses, set the great worlds
apart held firm for safety.  
4 Even as he mounted up they all adorned him: self-luminous he travels
clothed in splendour.  
That is the Bull's, the Asura's mighty figure: he, omniform, hath
reached the eternal waters.  
5 First the more ancient Bull engendered offspring; these are his many
draughts that lent him vigour.  
From days of old ye Kings, two Sons of Heaven, by hymns of sacrifice
have won dominion.  
6 Three seats ye Sovrans, in the Holy synod, many, yea, all, ye honour
with your presence.  
There saw I, going thither in the spirit, Gandharvas in their course
with wind-blown tresses.  
7 That same companionship of her, the Milch-cow, here with the strong
Bull's divers forms they stablished.  
Enduing still some new celestial figure, the skilful workers shaped a
form around him.  
8 Let no one here debar me from enjoying the golden light which Savitar
diffuses.  
He covers both all-fostering worlds with praises even as a woman
cherishes her children.  
9 Fulfil, ye twain, his work, the Great, the Ancient: as heavenly
blessing keep your guard around us.  
All the wise Gods behold his varied actions who stands erect, whose
voice is like a herdsman's.  
10 Call we on Indra, Maghavan, auspicious, best Hero in the fight where
spoil is gathered,  
The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras,
wins and gathers riches.
