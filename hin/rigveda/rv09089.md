### HYMN LXXXIX. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THIS Chariot-horse hath moved along the pathways, and Pavamana
flowed like rain from heaven.  
With us hath Soma with a thousand currents sunk in the wood, upon his
Mother's bosom.  
2. King, he hath clothed him in the robe of rivers, mounted the
straightest-going ship of Order.  
Sped by the Hawk the drop hath waxed in waters: the father drains it,
drains the Father's offspring.  
3 They come to him, red, tawny, Lord of Heaven, the watchful Guardian of
the meath, the Lion.  
First, Hero in the fight, he seeks the cattle, and with his eye the
Steer is our protector.  
4 They harness to the broad-wheeled car the mighty Courser whose back
bears meath, unwearied, awful.  
The twins, the sisters brighten him, and strengthen-these children of
one damethe vigorous Racer.  
5 Four pouring out the holy oil attend him, sitting together in the same
container.  
To him they flow, when purified, with homage, and still, from every
side, are first about him.  
6 He is the buttress of the heavens, supporter of earth, and in his hand
are all the people.  
Be the team's Lord a well to thee the singer: cleansed is the sweet
plant's stalk for deed of glory.  
7 Fighting, uninjured come where Gods are feasted; Soma, as Vitra-slayer
flow for Indra.  
Vouchsafe us ample riches very splendid may we be masters of heroic
vigour.
