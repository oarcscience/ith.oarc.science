### HYMN LXI. Uṣas.

1\. O Uṣas, strong with strength, endowed witli knowledge, accept the
singer's praise, O wealthy Lady.  
Thou, Goddess, ancient, young, and full of wisdom, movest,
all-bounteous! as the Law ordaineth.  
2 Shine forth, O Morning, thou auspicious Goddess, on thy bright car
awaking pleasant voices.  
Let docile horses of far-reaching splendour convey thee hitherward, the
goldencoloured.  
3 Thou, Morning, turning thee to every creature, standest on high as
ensign of the Immortal,  
To one same goal ever and ever wending now, like a wheel, O newly-born,
roll hi ther.  
4 Letting her reins drop downward, Morning cometh, the wealthy Dame, the
Lady of the dwelling;  
Bringing forth light, the Wonderful, the Blessed hath spread her from
the bounds of earth and heaven.  
5 Hither invoke the radiant Goddess Morning, and bring with reverence
your hymn to praise her.  
She, dropping sweets, hath set in heaven her brightness, and, fair to
look on, hath beamed forth her splendour.  
6 From heaven, with hymns, the Holy One was wakened: brightly to both
worlds came the wealthy Lady.  
To Morning, Agni, when she comes refulgent, thou goest forth soliciting
fair riches.  
7 On Law's firm base the speeder of the Mornings, the Bull, hath entered
mighty earth and heaven.  
Great is the power of Varuṇa and Mitra, which, bright, hath spread in
every place its splendour.
