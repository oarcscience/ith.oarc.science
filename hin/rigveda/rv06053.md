### HYMN LIII. Pūṣan.

1\. LORD of the path, O Pūṣan, we have yoked and bound thee to our
hymn,  
Even as a car, to win the prize.  
2 Bring us the wealth that men require, a manly master of a house,  
Free-handed with the liberal meed.  
3 Even him who would not give, do thou,  
O glowing Pūṣan, urge to give,  
And make the niggard's soul grow soft.  
4 Clear paths that we may win the prize; scatter our enemies afar.  
Strong God, be all our thoughts fulfilled.  
5 Penetrate with an awl, O Sage, the hearts of avaricious churls,  
And make them subject to our will.  
6 Thrust with thine awl, O Pūṣan: seek that which the niggard's heart
holds dear,  
And make him subject to our will.  
7 Tear up and read in pieces, Sage, the hearts of avaricious churls,  
And make them subject to our will.  
8 Thou, glowing Pūṣan, carriest an awl that urges men to prayer;  
Therewith do thou tear up and rend to shreds the heart of every one.  
9 Thou bearest, glowing Lord! a goad with horny point that guides the
cows  
Thence do we seek thy gift of bliss.  
10 And make this hymn of ours produce kine, horses, and a store of
wealth  
For our delight and use as men.
