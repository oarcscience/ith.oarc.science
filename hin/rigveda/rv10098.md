### HYMN XCVIII. The Gods.

1\. COME, be thou Mitra, Varuṇa, or Pūṣan, come, O Bṛhaspati, to mine
oblation:  
With Maruts, Vasus, or Ādityas, make thou Parjanya pour for Santanu his
rain-drops.  
2 The God, intelligent, the speedy envoy whom thou hast sent hath come
to me, Devapi:  
Address thyself to me and turn thee hither within thy lips will I put
brilliant language.  
3 Within my mouth, Bṛhaspati, deposit speech lucid, vigorous, and free
from weakness,  
Thereby to win for Santanu the rain-fall. The meath-rich drop from
heaven hath passed within it.  
4 Let the sweet drops descend on us, O Indra: give us enough to lade a
thousand wagons.  
Sit to thy Hotar task; pay worship duly, and serve the Gods, Devapi,
with oblation.  
5 Knowing the God's good-will, Devapi, Ṛṣi, the son of Rstisena, sate as
Hotar.  
He hath brought down from heaven's most lofty summit the ocean of the
rain, celestial waters.  
6 Gathered together in that highest ocean, the waters stood by deities
obstructed.  
They burried down set free by Arstisena, in gaping clefts, urged onward
by Devapi.  
7 When as chief priest for Santanu, Devapi, chosen for Hotar's duty,
prayed beseeching,  
Graciously pleased Bṛhaspati vouchsafed him a voice that reached the
Gods and won the waters.  
8 O Agni whom Devapi Arstisena, the mortal man, hath kindled in his
glory,  
Joying in him with all the Gods together, urge on the sender of the
rain, Parjanya.  
9 All ancient Ṛṣis with their songs approached thee, even thee, O
Much-invoked, at sacrifices.  
We have provided wagon-loads in thousands: come to the solemn rite, Lord
of Red Horses.  
10 The wagon-loads, the nine-and-ninety thousand, these have been
offered up to thee, O Agni.  
Hero, with these increase thy many bodies, and, stimulated, send us rain
from heaven.  
11 Give thou these ninety thousand loads, O Agni, to Indra, to the Bull,
to be his portion.  
Knowing the paths which Deities duly travel, set mid the Gods in heaven
Aulana also.  
12 O Agni, drive afar our foes, our troubles chase malady away and
wicked demons.  
From this air-ocean, from the lofty heavens, send down on us a mighty
flood of waters.
