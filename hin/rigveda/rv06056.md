*Rig Veda*, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, \[1896\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### HYMN LVI, Pūṣan.

1\. WHOSO remembers Pūṣan as cater of mingled curd and meal  
Need think no more upon the God.  
2 And he is best of charioteers. Indra, the hero's Lord, allied  
With him as Friend, destroys the foes.  
3 And there the best of charioteers hath guided through the speckled
cloud  
The golden wheel of Sūra's car.  
4 Whate’er we speak this day to thee, Wise, Wondrous God whom many
praise,  
Give thou fulfilment of our thought.  
5 Lead on this company of ours, that longs for kine, to win the spoil:  
Thou, Pūṣan, art renowned afar.  
6 Prosperity we crave from thee, afar from sin and near to wealth,  
Tending to perfect happiness both for to. morrow and to-day.
