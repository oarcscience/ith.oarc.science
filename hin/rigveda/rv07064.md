### HYMN LXIV. Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. YE Twain who rule, in heaven and earth, the region, clothed be your
clouds in robes of oil and fatness.  
May the imperial Varuṇa, and Mitra, and high-born Aryaman accept our
presents.  
2 Kings, guards of rrtighty everlasting Order, come hitherward, ye
Princes, Lords of Rivers.  
Send us from heaven, O Varuṇa and Mitra, rain and sweet food, ye who
pour down your bounties.  
3 May the dear God, and Varuṇa and Mitra conduct us by the most
effective pathways,  
That foes may say unto Sudās our chieftain, May, we, too, joy in food
with Gods to guard us.  
4 Him who hath wrought for you this car in spirit, who makes the song
rise upward and sustains it,  
Bedew with fatness, Varuṇa nd Mitra ye Kings, make glad the pleasant
dwelling-places.  
5 To you this laud, O Varuṇa and Mitra is offered like bright Soma juice
to Vāyu.  
Favour our songs of praise, wake thought and spirit. Preserve us
evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
