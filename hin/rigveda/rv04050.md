### HYMN L. Bṛhaspati.

1\. Him who with might hath propped earth's ends, who sitteth in
threefold seat, Bṛhaspati, with thunder,  
Him of the pleasant tongue have ancient sages, deep-thinking, holy
singers, set before them.  
2 Wild in their course, in well-marked wise rejoicing were they,
Bṛhaspati, who pressed around us.  
Preserve Bṛhaspati, the stall uninjured, this company's raining,
ever-moving birthplace.  
3 Bṛhaspati, from thy remotest distance have they sat down who love the
law eternal.  
For thee were dug wells springing from the mountain, which murmuring
round about pour streams of sweetness.  
4 Bṛhaspati, when first he had his being from mighty splendour in
supremest heaven,  
Strong, with his sevenfold mouth, with noise of thunder, with his seven
rays, blew and dispersed the darkness.  
5 With the loud-shouting band who sang his praises, with thunder, he
destroyed obstructive Vala.  
Bṛhaspati thundering drave forth the cattle, the lowing cows who make
oblations ready.  
6 Serve we with sacrifices, gifts, and homage even thus the Steer of all
the Gods, the Father.  
Bṛhaspati, may we be lords of riches, with noble progeny and store of
heroes.  
7 Surely that King by power and might heroic hath made him lord of all
his foes' posses-ions,  
Who cherishes Bṛhaspati well-tended, adorns and worships him as foremost
sharer.  
8 In his own house he dwells in peace and comfort: to him for ever holy
food flows richly.  
To him the people with free will pay homage-the King with whom the
Brahman hath precedence.  
9 He, unopposed, is master of the riches of his own subjects and of
hostile people.  
The Gods uphold that King with their protection who helps the Brahman
when he seeks his favour.  
10 Indra, Bṛhaspati, rainers of treasure, rejoicing at this sacrifice
drink the Soma.  
Let the abundant drops sink deep within you: vouchsafe us riches with
full store of heroes.  
11 Bṛhaspati and Indra, make us prosper may this be your benevolence to
us-ward.  
Assist our holy thoughts, wake up our spirit: weaken the hatred of our
foe and rivals.
