### HYMN XXXV. Ṛbhus.

1\. Come hither, O ye Sons of Strength, ye Ṛbhus; stay not afar, ye
Children of Sudhanvan.  
At this libation is your gift of treasure. Let gladdening draughts
approach you after Indra's.  
2 Hither is come the Ṛbhus' gift of riches; here was the drinking of the
well-pressed Soma,  
Since by dexterity and skill as craftsmen ye made the single chalice to
be fourfold  
3 Ye made fourfold the chalice that wag single: ye spake these words and
said, O Friend, assist us;  
Then, Vājas! gained the path of life eternal, deft-handed Ṛbhus, to the
Gods’ assembly.  
4 Out of what substance was that chalice fashioned which ye made
fourfold by your art and wisdom?  
Now for the gladdening draught press out the liquor, and drink, O Ṛbhus,
of die meath of Soma.  
5 Ye with your cunning made your Parents youthful; the cup, for Gods to
drink, ye formed with cunning;  
With cunning, Ṛbhus, rich in treasure, fashioned the two swift Tawny
Steeds who carry Indra.  
6 Whoso pours out for you, when days are closing, the sharp libation for
your joy, O Vājas,  
For him, O mighty Ṛbhus, ye, rejoicing, have fashioned wealth with
plenteous store of heroes.  
7 Lord of Bay Steeds, at dawn the juice thou drankest: thine, only
thine, is the noonday libation.  
Now drink thou with the wealth-bestowing Ṛbhus, whom for their skill
thou madest friends, O Indra.  
8 Ye, whom your artist skill hath raised to Godhead have set you down
above in heaven like falcons.  
So give us riches, Children of Sudhanvan, O Sons of Strength; ye have
become immortal.  
9 The third libation, that bestoweth treasure, which ye have won by
skill, ye dexterous-handed,—  
This drink hath been effused for you, O Ṛbhus . drink it with high
delight, with joy like Indra's.
