### HYMN XVII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. LIKE rivers down a steep descent, slaying the Vṛtras, full of
zeal,  
The rapid Soma-streams have flowed.  
2 The drops of Soma juice effused fall like the rain upon the earth:  
To Indra flow the Soma-streams.  
3 With swelling wave the gladdening drink, the Soma, flows intoṭhe
sieve,  
Loving the Gods and slaying fiends.  
4 It hastens to the pitchers, poured upon the sieve it waxes strong  
At sacrifices through the lauds.  
5 Soma, thou shinest mounting heaven as ’twere above light's triple
realm,  
And moving secm'st to speed the Sun.  
6 To him, the head of sacnfice, singers and bards have sung their
songs,  
Offering what he loves to see.  
7 The men, the sages with their hymns, eager for help, deck thee strong
&teed,  
Deck thee for service of the Gods.  
8 Flow onward to the stream of meath rest efficacious in thy home,  
Fair, to be drunk at sacrifice.
