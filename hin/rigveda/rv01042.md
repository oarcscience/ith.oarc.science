### HYMN XLII. Pūṣan.

1 SHORTEN our ways, O Pūṣan, move aside obstruction in the path:  
Go close before us, cloud-born God.  
2 Drive, Pūṣan, from our road the wolf, the wicked inauspicious wolf,  
Who lies in wait to injure us.  
3 Who lurks about the path we take, the robber with a guileful heart:  
Far from the road chase him away.  
4 Tread with thy foot and trample out the firebrand of the wicked one,  
The double-tongued, whoe’er he be.  
5 Wise Pūṣan, Wonder-Worker, we claim of thee now the aid wherewith  
Thou furtheredst our sires of old.  
6 So, Lord of all prosperity, best wielder of the golden sword,  
Make riches easy to be won.  
7 Past all pursuers lead us, make pleasant our path and fair to tread:  
O Pūṣan, find thou power for this.  
8 Lead us to meadows rich in grass: send on our way no early heat:  
O Pūṣan, find thou power for this.  
9 Be gracious to us, fill us full, give, feed us, and invigorate:  
O Pūṣan, find thou power for this.  
10 No blame have we for Pūṣan; him we magnify with songs of praise:  
We seek the Mighty One for wealth.
