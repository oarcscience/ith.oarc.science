### HYMN CVIII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. FOR Indra, flow thou Soma on, as gladdening juice most sweet,
intelligent,  
Great, cheering, dwelling most in heaven.  
2 Thou, of whom having drunk the Steer acts like a steer. drinking of
this that finds the light,  
He, Excellently Wise, is come to strengthening food, to spoil and wealth
like Etaśa.  
3 For, verily, Pavamana, thou hast, splendidest, called all the
generations of  
The Gods to immortality.  
4 By whom Dadhyac Navagva opens fastened doors, by whom the sages gained
their wish,  
By whom they won the fame of lovely Amṛta in the felicity of Gods.  
5 Effused, he floweth in a stream, best rapture-giver, in the long wool
of the sheep,  
Sporting, as ’twere the waters' wave.  
6 He who from out the rocky cavern took with might the redmrefulgent
watery Cows,  
Thou masterest the stable full of kine and steeds: burst it, brave Lord,
like one in mail.  
7 Press ye and pour him, like a steed, laudworthy, speeding through the
region and the flood,  
Who swims in water, roan in wood;  
8 Increaser of the water, Steer with thousand streams, dear to the race
of Deities;  
Who born in Law hath waxen mighty by the Law, King, God, and lofty
Ordinance.  
9 Make splendid glory shine on us, thou Lord of strengthening food, God,
as the Friend of Gods:  
Unclose the fount of middle air.  
10 Roll onward to the bowls, O Mighty One, effused, as Prince supporter
of the tribes.  
Pour on us rain from heaven, send us the waters' flow: incite our
thoughts to win the spoil.  
11 They have drained him the Steer of heaven, him with a thousand
streams, distilling rapturous joy,  
Him who brings all things excellent.  
12 The Mighty One was born Immortal, giving life, lightening darkness
with his shine.  
Wcll-praised by. sages he hath. by his wondrous power assumed the
Threefold as his robe.  
13 Effused is he who brings good things, who brings us bounteous gifts
and sweet refreshing food,  
Soma who brings us quiet homes:  
14 He whom our Indra and the Marut host shall drink, Bhaga shall drink
with Aryarnan,  
By whom we bring to us Mitra and Varuṇa and Indra for our great
defence.  
15 Soma, for Indra's drink do thou, led by the men, well-wcaponcd and
most gladdening,  
Flow on with greatest store of sweets.  
16 Enter the Soma-holder, even Indra's heart, as rivers pass into the
sea,  
Acceptable to Mitra, Vāyu, Varuṇa, the noblest Pillar of the heavens.
