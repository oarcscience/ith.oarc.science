### HYMN LXXVIII. Aśvins.

1\. YE Aśvins, hither come to us: Nāsatyas, be not disinclined.  
Fly hither like two swans unto the juice we shed.  
2 O Aśvins, like a pair of deer, like two wild cattle to the mead:  
Fly hither like two swans unto the juice we shed.  
3 O Aśvins rich in gifts, accept our sacrifice to prosper it:  
Fly hither like two swans unto the juice we shed.  
4 As Atri when descending to the cavern called on you loudly like a
wailing woman.  
Ye came to him, O Aśvins, with the freshest and most auspicious
fleetness of a falcon.  
5 Tree, part asunder like the side of her who bringeth forth a child.  
Ye Aśvins, listen to my call: loose Saptavadhri from his bonds.  
6 For Saptavadhri, for the seer affrighted when he wept and wailed,  
Ye, Aśvins, with your magic powers rent up the tree and shattered it.  
7 Like as the wind on every side ruffles a pool of lotuses,  
So stir in thee the babe unborn, so may the ten-month babe descend.  
8 Like as the wind, like as the wood, like as the sea is set astir,  
So also, ten-month babe, descend together with the after-birth.  
9 The child who hath for ten months' time been lying in his mother's
side,—  
May he come forth alive, unharmed, yea, living from the living dame.
