Heritage

### HYMN XLI. Indra.

1\. INVOKED to drink the Soma juice, come with thy Bay Steeds,
Thunder-armed  
Come, Indra, hitherward to me.  
2 Our priest is seated, true to time; the grass is regularly strewn;  
The pressing-stones were set at morn.  
3 These prayers, O thou who hearest prayer are offered: seat thee on the
grass.  
Hero, enjoy the offered cake.  
4 O Vṛtra-slayer, be thou pleased with these libations, with these
hymns,  
Song-loving Indra, with our lauds.  
5 Our hymns caress the Lord of Strength, vast, drinker of the Soma's
juice,  
Indra, as mother-cows their calf.  
6 Delight thee with the juice we pour for thine own great munificence:  
Yield not thy singer to reproach.  
7 We, Indra, dearly loving thee, bearing oblation, sing thee hymns  
Thou, Vasu, dearly lovest us.  
8 O thou to whom thy Bays are dear, loose not thy Horses far from us:  
Here glad thee, Indra, Lord divine.  
9 May long-maned Coursers, dropping oil, bring thee on swift car
hitherward,  
Indra, to seat thee on the grass.
