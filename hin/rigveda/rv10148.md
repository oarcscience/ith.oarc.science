### HYMN CXLVIII. Indra.

1\. WHEN we have pressed the juice we laud thee, Indra, and when, Most
Valorous we have won the booty.  
Bring us prosperity, as each desires it under thine own protection may
we conquer.  
2 Sublime from birth, mayst thou O Indra, Hero, with Sūrya overcome the
Dāsa races.  
As by a fountain's side, we bring the Soma that lay concealed,
close-hidden in the waters.  
3 Answer the votary's hymns, for these thou knowest, craving the Ṛṣis’
prayer, thyself a Singer  
May we be they who take delight in Somas: these with sweet food for
thee, O Chariot-rider.  
4 These holy prayers, O Indra, have I sung thee: grant to the men the
strength of men, thou Hero.  
Be of one mind with those in whom thou joyest: keep thou the singers
safe and their companions.  
5 Listen to Pṛthi's call, heroic Indra, and be thou lauded by the hymns
of Venya,  
Him who hath sung thee to thine oil-rich dwelling, whose rolling songs
have sped thee like a torrent.
