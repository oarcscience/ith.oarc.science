### HYMN XXVII. The Falcon.

1\. I, As I lay within the womb, considered all generations of these
Gods in order.  
A hundred iron fortresses confined me but forth I flew with rapid speed
a Falcon.  
2 Not at his own free pleasure did he bear me: he conquered with his
strength and manly courage.  
Straightway the Bold One left the fiends behind him and passed the winds
as he grew yet more mighty.  
3 When with loud cry from heaven down sped the Falcon, thence hasting
like the wind he bore the Bold One.  
Then, wildly raging in his mind, the archer Kṛśānu aimed and loosed the
string to strike him.  
4 The Falcon bore him from heaven's lofty summit as the swift car of
Indra's Friend bore Bhujyu.  
Then downward hither fell a flying feather of the Bird hasting forward
in his journey.  
5 And now let Maghavan accept the beaker, white, filled with milk,
filled with the shining liquid;  
The best of sweet meath which the priests have offered: that Indra to
his joy may drink, the Hero, that he may take and drink it to his
rapture.
