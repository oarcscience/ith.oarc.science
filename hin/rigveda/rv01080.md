### HYMN LXXX. Indra.

1\. THUS in the Soma, in wild joy the Brahman hath exalted thee:  
Thou, mightiest thunder-armed, hast driven by force the Dragon from the
earth, lauding thine own imperial sway.  
2 The mighty flowing Soma-draught, brought by the Hawk, hath gladdened
thee,  
That in thy strength, O Thunderer, thou hast struck down Vṛtra from the
floods, lauding thine own imperial sway.  
3 Go forward, meet the foe, be bold; thy bolt of thunder is not
checked.  
Manliness, Indra, is thy might: stay Vṛtra, make the waters thine,
lauding thine own imperial sway.  
4 Thou smotest Vṛtra from the earth, smotest him, Indra, from the sky.  
Let these life-fostering waters flow attended by the Marut host, lauding
thine own imperial sway.  
5 The wrathful Indra with his bolt of thunder rushing on the foe,  
Smote fierce on trembling Vṛtra's back, and loosed the waters free to
run, lauding his own imperial sway.  
6 With hundred-jointed thunderbolt Indra hath struck him on the back,  
And, while rejoicing in the juice, seeketh prosperity for friends,
lauding his own imperial sway.  
7 Indra, unconquered might is thine, Thunderer, Caster of the Stone;  
For thou with thy surpassing power smotest to death the guileful beast,
lauding thine own imperial sway.  
8 Far over ninety spacious floods thy thunderbolts were cast abroad:  
Great, Indra, is thy hero might, and strength is seated in thine arms,
lauding thine own imperial sway.  
9 Laud him a thousand all at once, shout twenty forth the hymn of
praise.  
Hundreds have sung aloud to him, to Indra hath the prayer been raised,
lauding his own imperial sway.  
10 Indra hath smitten down the power of Vṛtra,—might with stronger
might.  
This was his manly exploit, he slew Vṛtra and let loose the floods,
lauding his own imperial sway.  
11 Yea, even this great Pair of Worlds trembled in terror at thy
wrath,  
When, Indra, Thunderer, Marut-girt, thou slewest Vṛtra in thy strength,
lauding thine own imperial sway.  
12 But Vṛtra scared not Indra with his shaking or his thunder roar.  
On him that iron thunderbolt fell fiercely with its thousand points,
lauding his own imperial sway.  
13 When with the thunder thou didst make thy dart and Vṛtra meet in
war,  
Thy might, O Indra, fain to slay the Dragon, was set firm in heaven,
lauding thine own imperial sway.  
14 When at thy shout, O Thunder-armed, each thing both fixed and moving
shook,  
E’en Tvaṣṭar trembled at thy wrath and quaked with fear because of thee,
lauding thine own imperial sway.  
15 There is not, in our knowledge, one who passeth Indra in his
strength:  
In him the Deities have stored manliness, insight, power and might,
lauding his own imperial sway.  
16 Still as of old, whatever rite Atharvan, Manus sire of all,  
Dadhyach performed, their prayer and praise united in that Indra meet,
lauding his own imperial sway.
