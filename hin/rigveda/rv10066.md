### HYMN LXVI. Viśvedevas.

1\. I CALL the Gods of lofty glory for our weal, the makers of the
light, well-skilled in sacrifice;  
Those who have waxen mightily, Masters of all wealth, Immortal,
strengthening Law, the Gods whom Indra leads.  
2 For the strong band of Maruts will we frame a hymn: the chiefs shall
bring forth sacrifice for Indra's troop,  
Who, sent by Indra and advised by Varuṇa, have gotten for themselves a
share of Sūrya's light  
3 May Indra with the Vasus keep our dwelling safe, and Aditi with
Ādityas lend us sure defence.  
May the God Rudra with the Rudras favour us, and Tvaṣṭar with the Dames
further us to success.  
4 Aditi, Heaven and Earth, the great eternal Law, Indra, Viṣṇu, the
Maruts, and the lofty Sky.  
We call upon Ādityas, on the Gods, for help, on Vasus, Rudras, Savitar
of wondrous deeds.  
5 With Holy Thoughts Sarasvān, firm-lawed Varuṇa, great Vāyu, Pūṣan,
Viṣṇu, and the Aśvins Twain,  
Lords of all wealth, Immortal, furtherers of prayer, grant us a
triply-guarding refuge from distress.  
6 Strong be the sacrifice, strong be the Holy Ones, strong the preparers
of oblation, strong the Gods.  
Mighty be Heaven and Earth, true to eternal Law, strong be Parjanya,
strong be they who laud the Strong.  
7 To win us strength I glorify the Mighty Twain, Agni and Soma, Mighty
Ones whom many laud.  
May these vouchsafe us shelter with a triple guard, these whom the
strong have served in worship of the Gods.  
8 Potent, with firm-fixt laws, arranging sacrifice, visiting solemn
rites in splendour of the day,  
Obeying Order, these whose priest is Agni, free from falsehood, poured
the waters out when Vṛtra died.  
9 The Holy Ones engendered, for their several laws, the heavens and
earth, the waters, and the plants and trees.  
They filled the firmament with heavenly light for help: the Gods
embodied Wish and made it beautiful.  
10 May they who bear up heaven, the Ṛbhus deft of hand, and Vāta and
Parjanya of the thundering Bull,  
The waters and the plants, promote the songs we sing: come Bhaga, Rati,
and the Vaijns to my call.  
11 Sindhu, the sea, the region, and the firmament, the thunder, and the
ocean, Aja-Ekapād,  
The Dragon of the Deep, shall listen to my words, and all the Deities
and Princes shall give ear.  
12 May we, be yours, we men, to entertain the Gods: further our
sacrifice and give it full success.  
Ādityas, Rudras, Vasus, givers of good gifts, quicken the holy hymns
which we are singing now  
13 I follow with success upon the path of Law the two celestial Hotars,
Priests of oldest time.  
We pray to him who dwelleth near, Guard of the Field, to all Immortal
Gods who never are remiss.  
14 Vasiṣṭha's sons have raised their voices, like their sire. Ṛṣi-like
praying to the Gods for happiness.  
Like friendly-minded kinsmen, come at our desire, O Gods, and shake down
treasures on us from above.  
15 Immortal Gods have I, Vasiṣṭha, lauded, Gods set on high above all
other beings.  
May they this day grant us wide space and freedom: ye Gods, preserve us
evermore with blessings.
