### HYMN XXVII. Indra.

1 WHAT deed hath Indra done in the wild transport, in quaffing or in
friendship with, the Soma?  
What joys have men of ancient times or recent obtained within the
chamber of libation?  
2 In its wild joy Indra hath proved him faithful, faithful in quaffing,
faithful in its friendship.  
His truth is the delight that in this chamber the men of old and recent
times have tasted.  
3 All thy vast power, O Maghavan, we know not, know not the riches of
thy full abundance.  
No one hath seen that might of thine, productive of bounty every day
renewed, O Indra.  
4 This one great power of thine our eyes have witnessed, wherewith thou
slewest Varasikha's children,  
When by the force of thy descending thunder, at the mere solund, their
boldest was demolished.  
5 In aid of Abhyavartin Cayamana, Indra destroyed the seed of
Varasikha.  
At Hariyupiya he smote the vanguard of the Vrcivans, and the rear fled
frighted.  
6 Three thousand, mailed, in quest of fame, together, on the Yavyavati,
O much-sought Indra,  
Vrcivan's sons, falling before the arrow, like bursting vessels went to
their destruction.  
7 He, whose two red Steers, seeking goodly pasture, plying their tongues
move on 'twixt earth and heaven,  
Gave Turvaśa to Sṛñjaya, and, to aid him, gave the Vrcivans up to
Daivavata.  
8 Two wagon-teams, with damsels, twenty oxen, O Agni, Abhydvartin
Cayamdna,  
The liberal Sovran, giveth me. This guerdon of Prthu's seed is hard to
win from others.
