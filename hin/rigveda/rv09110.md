### HYMN CX. Soma Pavamana.

1\. O'ERPOWERING Vṛtras, forward run to win great strength:  
Thou speedest to subdue like one exacting debts.  
2 In thee, effused, O Soma, we rejoice ourselves for great supremacy in
fight.  
Thou, Pavamana, enterest into mighty deeds,  
3 O Pavamana, thou didst generate the Sun, and spread the moisture out
with power,  
Hasting to us with plenty vivified with milk.  
4 Thou didst produce him, Deathless God mid mortal men for maintenance
of Law and lovely Amṛta:  
Thou evermore hast moved making strength flow to us.  
5 All round about hast thou with glory pierced for us as ’twere a
never-failing well for men to drink,  
Borne on thy way in fragments from the presser's arms.  
6 Then, beautifully radiant, certain Heavenly Ones, have sung to him
their kinship as they looked thereon,  
And Savitar the God opens as ’twere a stall.  
7 Soma, the men of old whose grass was trimmed addressed the hymn to
thee for mighty strength and for renown:  
So, Hero, urge us onward to heroic power.  
8 They have drained forth from out the great depth of the sky the old
primeval milk of heaven that claims the laud:  
They lifted up their voice to Indra athis birth.  
9 As long as thou, O Pavamana, art above this earth and heaven and all
existence in thy might,  
Thou standest like a Bull the chief amid the herd.  
10 In the sheep's wool hath Soma Pavamana flowed, while they cleanse
him, like a playful infant,  
Indu with hundred powers and hundred currents.  
11 Holy and sweet, while purified, this Indu flows on, a wave of
pleasant taste, to Indra,—  
Strength-winner, Treasure-finder, Life. bestower.  
12 So flow thou on, subduing our assailants, chasing the demons hard to
beencountered,  
Well-armed and conquering our foes, O Soma.
