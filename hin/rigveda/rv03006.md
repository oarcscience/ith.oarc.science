### HYMN VI. Agni.

1\. URGED on by deep devotion, O ye singers, bring, pious ones, the
God-approaching ladle.  
Borne onward to the right it travels eastward, and, filled with oil, to
Agni bears oblation.  
2 Thou at thy birth didst fill both earth and heaven, yea, Most
Adorable, thou didst exceed them.  
Even through the heaven's and through the earth's expanses let thy swift
seventongued flames roll on, O Agni.  
3 Both Heaven and Earth and Gods who should be worshipped establish thee
as Priest for every dwelling,  
Whenever human families, God-devoted, bringing oblations; laud thy
splendid lustre.  
4 Firm in the Gods’ home is the Mighty seated, between vast Heaven and
Earth the well-beloved-  
Those Cows who yield, unharmed, their nectar, Spouses of the
Far-Strider, everyoung, united.  
5 Great are the deeds of thee, the Great, O Agni: thou by thy power hast
spread out earth and heaven.  
As soon as thou wast born thou wast an envoy, thou, Mighty One, was
Leader of the people.  
6 Bind to the pole with cords of holy Order the long-maned ruddy steeds
who sprinkle fatness.  
Bring hithier, O thou God, all Gods together: provide them noble
worship, Jātavedas.  
7 Even from the sky thy brilliant lights shone hither: still hast thou
beamed through many a radiant morning,  
That the Gods praised their joyous Herald's labour eagerly burning,
Agni, in the forests.  
8 The Gods who take delight in air's wide region, or those the dwellers
in heaven's realm of brightness,  
Or those, the Holy, prompt to hear, our helpers, who, carborne, turn
their horses hither, Agni—-  
9 With these, borne on one ear, Agni, approach us, or borne on many, for
thy steeds are able.  
Bring, witb their Dames, the Gods, the Three and-Thirty, after thy
Godlike nature, and be joyful.  
10 He is the Priest at whose repeated worship even wide Heaven and Earth
sing out for increase.  
They fair and true and holy coming forward stand at his sacrifice who
springs from Order.  
11 As holy food, Agni, to thine invoker give wealth in cattle, lasting,
rich in marvels.  
To us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious
will to usward.
