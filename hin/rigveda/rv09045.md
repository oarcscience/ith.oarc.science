### HYMN XLV. Soma Pavamana.

1\. FLOW, thou who viewest men, to give delight, to entertain the
Gods,  
Indu, to Indra for his drink.  
2 Stream to thine embassy for us: thou hastenest, for Indra, to  
The Gods, O better than our friends.  
3 We balm thee, red of hue, with milk to fit thee for the rapturous
joy:  
Unbar for us the doors of wealth.  
4 He through the sieve hath passed, as comes a courser to the pole, to
run  
Indu belongs unto the Gods.  
5 All friends have lauded him as he sports in the wood, beyond the
fleece:  
Singers have chanted Indu's praise.  
6 Flow, Indu, with that stream wherein steeped thou announcest to the
man  
Who worships thee heroic strength.
