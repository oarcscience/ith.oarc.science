### HYMN XLIV. Agni.

1 IMMORTAL Jātavedas, thou many-hued fulgent gift of Dawn,  
Agni, this day to him who pays oblations bring the Gods who waken with
the morn.  
2 For thou art offering-bearer and loved messenger, the charioteer of
sacrifice:  
Accordant with the Aśvins and with Dawn grant us heroic strength and
lofty fame.  
3 As messenger we choose to-day Agni the good whom many love,  
Smoke-bannered spreader of the light, at break of day glory of
sacrificial rites.  
4 Him noblest and most youthful, richly worshipped guest, dear to the
men who offer gifts,  
Him, Agni Jātavedas, I beseech at dawn that he may bring the Gods to
us.  
5 Thee, Agni, will I glorify, deathless nourisher of the world,  
Immortal, offering-bearer, meet for sacred food, preserver, best at
sacrifice.  
6 Tell good things to thy praiser, O most youthful God, as richly
worshipped, honey-tongued,  
And, granting to Praskaṇva lengthened days of life, show honour to the
Heavenly Host.  
7 For the men, Agni, kindle thee as all possessor and as Priest;  
So Agni, much-invoked, bring hither with all speed the Gods, the
excellently wise,  
8 At dawn of day, at night, Uṣas and Savitar, the Aśvins, Bhaga, Agni's
self:  
Skilled in fair rites, with Soma poured, the Kaṇvas light thee, the
oblation-wafting God.  
9 For, Agni, Lord of sacrifice and messenger of men art thou:  
Bring thou the Gods who wake at dawn who see the light, this day to
drink the Soma juice.  
10 Thou shonest forth, O Agni, after former dawns, all visible, O rich
in light.  
Thou art our help in battle-strife, the Friend of man, the great high
priest in sacrifice.  
11 Like Manu, we will stablish thee, Agni, performer of the rite,  
Invoker, ministering Priest, exceeding wise, the swift immortal
messenger.  
12 When as the Gods’ High Priest, by many loved, thou dost their mission
as their nearest Friend,  
Then, like the far-resounding billows of the flood, thy flames, O Agni,
roar aloud.  
13 Hear, Agni, who hast ears to hear, with all thy train of escort
Gods;  
Let Mitra, Aryaman, seeking betimes our rite, seat them upon the sacred
grass.  
14 Let those who strengthen Law, who bountifully give, the life-tongued
Maruts, hear our praise.  
May Law-supporting Varuṇa with the Aśvins twain and Uṣas, drink the Soma
juice.
