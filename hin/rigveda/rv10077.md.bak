### HYMN LXXVII. Maruts.

1\. As with their voice from cloud they sprinkle treasure so are the
wise man's liberal sacrifices.  
I praise their Company that merits worship as the good Martits' priest
to pay them honour.  
2 The youths have wrought their ornaments for glory through many
nights,—this noble band of Maruts.  
Like stags the Sons of Dyatis have striven onward, the Sons of Aditi
grown strong like pillars.  
3 They who extend beyond the earth and heaven, by their own mass, as
from the cloud spreads Sūrya;  
Like mighty Heroes covetous of glory, like heavenly gallants who destroy
the wicked.  
4 When ye come nigh, as in the depth of waters, the earth is loosened,
as it were, and shaken.  
This your all-feedin sacrifice approaches: come all united, fraught, as
’twere with viands.  
5 Ye are like horses fastened to the chariot poles, luminous with your
beams, with splendour as at dawn;  
Like self-bright falcons, punishers of wicked men, like hovering birds
urged forward, scattering rain around.  
6 When ye come forth, O Maruts, from the distance, from the great
treasury of rich possessions,  
Knowing, O Vasus, boons that should be granted, even from afar drive
back the men who hate us.  
7 He who, engaged in the rite's final duty brings, as a man, oblation to
the Maruts,  
Wins him life's wealthy fulness, blest with heroes: he shall be present,
too, where Gods drink Soma.  
8 For these are helps adored at sacrifices, bringing good fortune by
their name Ādityas.  
Speeding on cars let them protect our praises, delighting in our
sacrifice and worship.
