### HYMN LXXIV. Aśvins.

1\. To this mine invocation, O ye Aśvins, ye Nāsatyas, come,  
To drink the savoury Soma juice.  
2 This laud of mine, ye Aśvins Twain, and this mine invitation hear,  
To drink the savoury Soma juice.  
3 Here Kṛṣṇa is invoking you, O Aśvins, Lords of ample wealth.  
To drink the savoury Soma juice.  
4 List, Heroes, to the singer's call, the call of Kṛṣṇa lauding you,  
To drink the savoury Soma juice.  
5 Chiefs, to the sage who sings your praise grant an inviolable home,  
To drink the savoury Soma juice.  
6 Come to the worshipper's abode, Aśvins, who here is lauding you,  
To drink the savoury Soma juice.  
7 Yoke to the firmly jointed car the ass which draws you, Lords of
wealth.  
To drink the savoury Soma juice.  
8 Come hither, Aśvins, on your car of triple form with triple seat,  
To drink the savoury Soma juice.  
9 O Aśvins, O Nāsatyas, now accept with favouring grace my songs,  
To drink the savoury Soma juice.
