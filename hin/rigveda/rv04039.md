### HYMN XXXIX Dadhikrās.

1\. Now give we praise to Dadhikrās the rapid, and mention in our laud
the Earth and Heaven.  
May the Dawns flushing move me to exertion, and bear me safely over
every trouble.  
2 I praise the mighty Steed who fills my spirit, the Stallion
Dadhikrāvan rich in bounties,  
Whom, swift of foot and shining bright as Agni, ye, Varuṇa and Mitra,
gave to Pūrus.  
3 Him who hath honoured, when the flame is kindled at break of dawn, the
Courser Dadhikrāvan,  
Him, of one mind with Varuṇa and Mitra may Aditi make free from all
transgression.  
4 When we remember mighty Dadhikrāvan our food and strength, then the
blest name of Maruts,  
Varuṇa, Mitra, we invoke for welfare, and Agni, and the thunder-wielding
Indra.  
5 Both sides invoke him as they call on Indra when they stir forth and
turn to sacrificing.  
To us have Varuṇa and Mitra granted the Courser Dadhikrās, a guide for
mortals.  
6 So have I glorified with praise strong Dadhikrāvan, conquering
Steed.  
Sweet may he make our mouths; may he prolong the days we have to live.
