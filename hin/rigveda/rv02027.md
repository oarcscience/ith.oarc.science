### HYMN XXVII. Ādityas.

1\. THESE hymns that drop down fatness, with the ladle I ever offer to
the Kings Ādityas.  
May Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga hear us, the mighty Varuṇa Dakṣa, and
Aṁśa.  
2 With one accord may Aryaman and Mitra and Varuṇa this day accept this
praise-song—  
Ādityas bright and pure as streams of water, free from all guile and
falsehood, blameless, perfect.  
3 These Gods, Ādityas, vast, profound, and faithful, with many eyes,
fain to deceive the wicked,  
Looking within behold the good and evil near to the Kings is even the
thing most distant.  
4 Upholding that which moves and that which moves not, Ādityas, Gods,
protectors of all being,  
Provident, guarding well the world of spirits, true to eternal Law, the
debt-exactors.  
5 May I, Ādityas, share m this your favour which, Aryaman, brings profit
e’en in danger.  
Under your guidance, Varuṇa and Mitra, round troubles may I pass, like
rugged places.  
6 Smooth is your path, O Aryaman and Mitra; excellent is it, Varuṇa, and
thornless.  
Thereon, Ādityas, send us down your blessing: grant us a shelter hard to
be demolished.  
7 Mother of Kings, may Aditi transport us, by fair paths Aryaman, beyond
all hatred.  
May we uninjured, girt by many heroes, win Varuṇa's and Mitra's high
protection.  
8 With their support they stay three earths, three heavens; three are
their functions in the Gods’ assembly.  
Mighty through Law, Ādityas, is your greatness; fair is it, Aryaman,
Varuṇa, and Mitra.  
9 Golden and splendid, pure like streams of water, they hold aloft the
three bright heavenly regions.  
Ne’er do they slumber, never close their eyelids, faithful, far-ruling
for the righteous mortal.  
10 Thou over all, O Varuṇa, art Sovran, be they Gods, Asura! or be they
mortals.  
Grant unto us to see a hundred autumns ours be the blest long lives of
our forefathers.  
11 Neither the right nor left do I distinguish, neither the cast nor yet
the west, Ādityas.  
Simple and guided by your wisdom, Vasus! may I attain the light that
brings no danger.  
12 He who bears gifts unto the Kings, true Leaders, he whom their
everlasting blessings prosper,  
Moves with his chariot first in rank and wealthy, munificent and lauded
in assemblies.  
13 Pure, faithful, very strong, with heroes round him, he dwells beside
the waters rich with pasture.  
None slays, from near at hand or from a distance, him who is under the
Ādityas’ guidance.  
14 Aditi, Mitra, Varuṇa, forgive us however we have erred and sinned
against you.  
May I obtain the broad light free from peril: O Indra, let not during
darkness seize us.  
15 For him the Twain united pour their fulness, the rain from heaven: he
thrives most highly favoured.  
He goes to war mastering both the mansions: to him both portions of the
world are gracious.  
16 Your guiles, ye Holy Ones, to quell oppressors, your snares spread
out against the foe, Ādityas,  
May I car-borne pass like a skilful horseman: uninjured may we dwell in
spacious shelter.  
17 May I not live, O Varuṇa, to witness my wealthy, liberal, dear
friend's destitution.  
King, may O never lack well-ordered riches. Loud may we speak, with
heroes, in assembly.
