Heritage

### HYMN XI. Agni.

1\. GREAT art thou, Agni, sacrifice's Herald: not without thee are
deathless Gods made joyful.  
Come hither with all Deities about thee here take thy seat, the first,
as Priest, O Agni.  
2 Men with oblations evermore entreat thee, the swift, to undertake an
envoy's duty.  
He on whose sacred grass with Gods thou sittest, to him, O Agni, are the
days propitious.  
3 Three times a day in thee are shown the treasures sent for the mortal
who presents oblation.  
Bring the Gods hither like a man, O Agni: be thou our envoy, guarding us
from curses.  
4 Lord of the lofty sacrifice is Agni, Agni is Lord of every gift
presented.  
The Vasus were contented with his wisdom, so the Gods made him their
oblationbearer.  
5 O Agni, bring the Gods to taste our presents: with Indra leading, here
let them be joyful.  
Convey this sacrifice to Gods in heaven. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore
with blessings.
