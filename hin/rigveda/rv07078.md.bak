### HYMN LXXVIII. Dawn.

1\. WE have beheld her earliest lights approaching: her many glories
part, on high, asunder.  
On car sublime, refulgent, wending hither, O Uṣas, bring the Wealth that
makes us happy.  
2 The fire well-kindIed sings aloud to greet her, and with their hymns
the priests are chaming welcome.  
Uṣas approaches in her splendour, driving all evil darkness far away,
the Goddess.  
3 Apparent eastward are those lights of Morning, sending out lustre, as
they rise, around them.  
She hath brought forth Sun, sacrifice, and Agni, and far away hath fled
detested darkness.  
4 Rich Daughter of the Sky, we all behold her, yea, all men look on Dawn
as she is breaking.  
fler car that moves self-harnessed hath she mounted, the car drawn
onward by her well-yoked horses.  
5 Inspired with loving thoughts this day to greet thee, we and our
wealthy nobles have awakened.  
Show yourselves fruitful, Dawns, as ye are rising. Preserve us evermore,
ye Gods, with blessings.
