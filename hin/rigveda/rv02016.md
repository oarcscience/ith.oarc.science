### HYMN XVI. Indra.

1\. To him, your own, the best among the good, I bring eulogy, like
oblation in the kindled fire.  
We invocate for help Indra untouched by eld, who maketh all decay,
strengthened, for ever young.  
2 Without whom naught exists, Indra the Lofty One; in whom alone all
powers heroic are combined.  
The Soma is within him, in his frame vast strength, the thunder in his
hand and wisdom in his head.  
3 Not by both worlds is thine own power to be surpassed, nor may thy car
be stayed by mountains or by seas.  
None cometh near, O Indra, to thy thunderbolt, when with swift steeds
thou fliest over many a league.  
4 For all men bring their will to him the Resolute, to him the Holy One,
to him the Strong they cleave.  
Pay worship with oblation, strong and passing wise. Drink thou the Soma,
Indra, through the mighty blaze.  
5 The vessel of the strong flows forth, the flood of meath, unto the
Strong who feeds upon the strong, for drink,  
Strong are the two Adhvaryus, strong are both the stones. They press the
Soma that is strong for him the Strong.  
6 Strong is thy thunderbolt, yea, and thy car is strong; strong are thy
Bay Steeds and thy weapons powerful.  
Thou, Indra, Bull, art Lord of the strong gladdening drink. with the
strong Soma, Indra, satisfy thyself.  
7 I, bold by prayer, come near thee in thy sacred rites, thee like a
saving ship, thee shouting in the war.  
Verily he will hear and mark this word of ours: we will pour Indra forth
as ’twere a spring of wealth.  
8 Turn thee unto us ere calamity come nigh, as a cow full of pasture
turns her to her calf.  
Lord of a Hundred Powers, may we once firmly cling to thy fair favours
even as husbands to their wives.  
9 Now let that wealthy Cow of thine, O Indra, yield in return a boon to
him who lauds thee.  
Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Loud may we speak, with
heroes, in assembly.
