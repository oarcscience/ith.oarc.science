### HYMN CI. Parjanya.

1 SPEAK forth three words, the words which light precedeth, which milk
this udder that produceth nectar.  
Quickly made manifest, the Bull hath bellowed, engendering the germ of
plants, the Infant.  
2 Giver of growth to plants, the God who ruleth over the waters and all
moving creatures,  
Vouchsafe us triple shelter for our refuge, and threefold light to
succour and befriend us.  
3 Now he is sterile, now begetteth offspring, even as he willeth doth he
change his figure.  
The Father's genial flow bedews the Mother; therewith the Sire,
therewith the son is nourished.  
4 In him all living creatures have their being, and the three heavens
with triply-flowing waters.  
Three reservoirs that sprinkle down their treasure shed their sweet
streams around him with a murmur.  
5 May this my song to Sovran Lord Parjanya come near unto his heart and
give him pleasure.  
May we obtain the showers that bring enjoyment, and God-protected plants
with goodly fruitage.  
6 He is the Bull of all, and their impregner: he holds the life of all
things fixed and moving.  
May this rite save me till my hundredth autumn. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
