### HYMN IV. Agni.

1\. To thee will send praise and bring oblation, as thou hast merited
lauds when we invoked thee.  
A fountain in the desert art thou, Agni, O Ancient King, to man who fain
would worship,  
2 Thou unto whom resort the gathered people, as the kine seek the warm
stall, O Most Youthful.  
Thou art the messenger of Gods and mortals, and goest glorious with thy
light between them.  
3 Making thee grow as ’twere some noble infant, thy Mother nurtures thee
with sweet affection.  
Over the desert slopes thou passest longing, and seekest, like some
beast set free, thy fodder.  
4 Foolish are we, O Wise and free from error: verily, Agni, thou dost
know thy grandeur.  
There lies the form: he moves and licks, and swallows, and, as
House-Lord, kisses the Youthful Maiden.  
5 He rises ever fresh in ancient fuel: smoke-bannered, gray, he makes
the wood his dwelling.  
No swimmer, Steer, he presses through the waters, and to his place
accordant mortals bear him.  
6 Like thieves who risk their lives and haunt the forest, the twain with
their ten girdles have secured him.  
This is a new hymn meant for thee, O Agni: yoke as it were thy car with
parts that glitter.  
7 Homage and prayer are thine, O Jātavedas, and this my song shall
evermore exalt thee.  
Agni, protect our children and descendants, and guard with
ever-watcliful care our bodies.
