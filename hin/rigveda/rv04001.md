### HYMN I. Agni.

1, THEE Agni, have the Gods, ever of one accord, sent hither down, a
God, appointed messenger, yea, with their wisdom sent thee down.  
The Immortal, O thou Holy One, mid mortal men, the God-devoted God, the
wise, have they brought forth, brought forth the omnipresent God-devoted
Sage.  
2 As such, O Agni, bring with favour to the Gods thy Brother Varuṇa who
loveth sacrifice,  
True to the Law, the Āditya who supporteth men, the King, supporter of
mankind.  
3 Do thou, O Friend, turn hither him who is our Friend, swift as a
wheel, like two car-steeds in rapid course, Wondrous! to us in rapid
course.  
O Agni, find thou grace for us with Varuṇa, with Maruts who illumine
all.  
Bless us, thou Radiant One, for seed and progeny, yea, bless us, O thou
Wondrous God.  
4 Do thou who knowest Varuṇa, O Agni, put far away from us the God's
displeasure.  
Best Sacrificer, brightest One, refulgent remove thou far from us all
those who hate us.  
5 Be thou, O Agni, nearest us with succour, our closest Friend while now
this Morn is breaking.  
Reconcile to us Varuṇa, be bounteous enjoy the gracious juice; be swift
to hear us.  
6 Excellent is the glance, of brightest splendour, which the auspicious
God bestows on mortals-  
The God's glance, longed-for even as the butter, pure, heated, of the
cow, the milch-cow's bounty.  
7 Three are those births, the true, the most exalted, eagerly
longed-for, of the God, of Agni.  
He came invested in the boundless region, pure, radiant, friendly,
mightily resplendent.  
8 This envoy joyeth in all seats of worship, borne on his golden car,
sweet-tongued Invoker:  
Lovely to look on, with red steeds, effulgent, like a feast rich in
food, joyous for ever.  
9 Allied by worship, let him give man knowledge: by an extended cord
they lead him onward.  
He stays, effectual in this mortal's dwelling, and the God wins a share
in his possessions.  
10 Let Agni -for he knows the way- conduct us to all that he enjoys of
God-sent riches,  
What all the Immortals have prepared with wisdom, Dyaus, Sire, Begetter,
raining down true blessings.  
11 In houses first he sprang into existence, at great heaven's base, and
in this region's bosom;  
Footless and headless, both his ends concealing, in his Bull's lair
drawing himself together.  
12 Wondrously first he rose aloft, defiant, in the Bull's lair, the
homeof holy Order,  
Longed-for, young, beautiful, and far-resplendent: and sevendear frieuds
sprang up unto the Mighty.  
13 Here did our human fathers take their places, fain to fulfil the
sacred Law of worship.  
Forth drave they, with loud call, Dawn's teeming Milch-kine bid in the
mountainstable, in the cavern.  
14 Splendid were they when they had rent the mountain: others, around,
shall tell forth this their exploit.  
They sang their song, prepared to free the cattle: they found the light;
with holy hymns they worshipped.  
15 Eager, with thought intent upon the booty, the men with their
celestial speech threw open,  
The solid mountain firm, compact, enclosing, confining Cows, the stable
full of cattle.  
16 The Milch-cow's earliest name they comprehended: they found the
Mother's thrice-seven noblest titles.  
This the bands knew, and sent forth acclamation:with the Bull's sheen
the Red One was apparent.  
17 The turbid darkness fled, the heaven was sp, endid! up rose the
bright beam of celestial Morning.  
Sūrya ascended to the wide expanses, beholding deeds of men both good
and evil.  
18 Then, afterwards they looked around, awakened, when first they held
that Heaven allotted treasure.  
Now all the Gods abide in all their dwellings. Varuṇa, Mitra, be the
prayer effective.  
19 I will call hither brightly-beaming Agni, the Herald, all-supporting,
best at worship.  
He hath disclosed, like the milch cows' pure udder, the Sorria's juice
when cleansed and poured from beakers.  
20 The freest God of all who should be worshipped, the guest who is
received in all men's houses,  
Agni who hath secured the Gods’ high favour,—may he be gracious, to us
Jātavedas.
