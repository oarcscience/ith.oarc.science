### HYMN VII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. FORTH on their way the glorious drops have flowed for maintenance of
Law,  
Knowing this sacrifice's course.  
2 Down in the mighty waters sinks the stream of meath, most excellent,  
Oblation best of all in worth.  
3 About the holy place, the Steer true, guileless, noblest, hath sent
forth  
Continuous voices in the wood.  
4 When, clothed in manly strength, the Sage flows in celestial wisdom
round,  
The Strong would win the light of heaven.  
5 When purified, he sits as King above the hosts, among his folk,  
What time the sages bring him nigh.  
6 Dear, golden-coloured, in the fleece he sinks and settles in the
wood:  
The Singer shows his zeal in hymns.  
7 He goes to Indra, Vāyu, to the Aśvins, as his custom is,  
With gladdening juice which gives them joy.  
8 Tle streams of pleasant Soma flow to Bhaga, Mitra-Varuṇa,—  
Well-knowing through his mighty powers.  
Heaven and Earth, riches of meath to win us wealth:  
Gain for us treasures and renown.
