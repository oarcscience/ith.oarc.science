### HYMN CXXXV. Yama.

1\. IN the Tree clothed with goodly leaves where Yama drinketh with the
Gods,  
The Father, Master of the house, tendeth with love our ancient Sires.  
2 I looked reluctantly on him who cherishes those men of old,  
On him who treads that evil path, and then I yearned for this again.  
3 Thou mountest, though thou dost not see, O Child, the new and
wheel-less car  
Which thou hast fashioned mentally, onepoled but turning every way.  
4 The car which thou hast made to roll hitherward from the Sages,
Child!  
This hath the Sāman followed close, hence, laid together on a ship.  
5 Who was the father of the child? Who made the chariot roll away?  
Who will this day declare to us how the funeral gift was made?  
6 When the funeral gift was placed, straightway the point of flame
appeared.  
A depth extended in the front: a passage out was made behind.  
7 Here is the seat where Yama dwells, that which is called the Home of
Gods:  
Here minstrels blow the flute for him here he is glorified with songs.
