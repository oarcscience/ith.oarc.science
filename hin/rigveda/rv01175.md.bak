### HYMN CLXXV. Indra.

1\. GLAD thee: thy glory hath been quaffed, Lord of Bay Steeds, as
’twere the bowl's enlivening mead.  
For thee the Strong there is strong drink, mighty, omnipotent to win.  
2 Let our strong drink, most excellent, exhilarating, come to thee,  
Victorious, Indra! bringing gain, immortal conquering in fight,  
3 Thou, Hero, winner of the spoil, urgest to speed the car of man.  
Burn, like a vessel with the flame, the lawless Dasyu, Conqueror!  
4 Empowered by thine own might, O Sage, thou stolest Sūrya's chariot
wheel.  
Thou barest Kutsa with the steeds of Wind to Śuṣṇa as his death.  
5 Most mighty is thy rapturous joy, most splendid is thine active
power,  
Wherewith, foe-slaying, sending bliss, thou art supreme in gaining
steeds.  
6 As thou, O Indra, to the ancient singers wast ever joy, as water to
the thirsty,  
So unto thee I sing this invocation. May we find strengthening food in
full abundance.
