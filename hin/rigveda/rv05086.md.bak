### HYMN LXXXVI. Indra-Agni.

1\. THE mortal man whom ye, the Twain, Indra and Agni, help in fight,  
Breaks through e’en strongly-guarded wealth as Tṛta burst his way
through reeds.  
2 The Twain invincible in war, worthy to be renowned in frays,  
Lords of the Fivefold. People, these, Indra and Agni, we invoke.  
3 Impetuous is their strength, and keen the lightning of the mighty
Pair,  
Which from their arms speeds with the car to Vṛtra's slayer for the
kine.  
4 Indra and Agni, we invoke you both, as such, to send your cars:  
Lords of quick-coming bounty, ye who know, chief lovers of the song.  
5 These who give increase day by day, Gods without guile for mortal
man,  
Worthy themselves, I honour most, Two Gods as partners, for my horse.  
6 The strength-bestowing offering thus to Indra-Agni hath been paid, as
butter, purified by stones.  
Deal to our princes high renown, deal wealth to those who sing your
praise, deal food to those who sing your praise.
