### HYMN XL. Indra-Agni.

1\. INDRA and Agni, surely ye as Conquerors will give us wealth,  
Whereby in fight we may o’ercome that which is strong and firmly fixed,
as Agni burns the woods with wind. Let all the others die away.  
2 We set no snares to tangle you; Indra we worship and adore, Hero of
heroes mightiest.  
Once may he come unto us with his Steed, come unto us to win us
strength, and to complete the sacrifice.  
3 For, famous Indra-Agni, ye are dwellers in the midst of frays.  
Sages in wisdom, ye are knit to him who seeketh you as friends. Heroes,
bestow on him his wish.  
4 Nabhāka-like, with sacred song Indra's and Agni's praise I sing,  
Theirs to whom all this world belongs, this heaven and this mighty earth
which bear rich treasure in their lap.  
5 To Indra and to Agni send your prayers, as was Nabhāka's wont,—  
Who oped with sideway opening the sea with its foundations seven—Indra
all powerful in his might.  
6 Tear thou asunder, as of old, like tangles of a creeping plant,  
Demolish thou the Dāsa's might. May we with Indra's help divide the
treasure he hath gathered up.  
7 What time with this same song these men call Indra-Agni sundry ways,  
May we with our own heroes quell those who provoke us to the fight, and
conquer those who strive with us.  
8 The Two refulgent with their beams rise and come downward from the
sky.  
By Indra's and by Agni's hest, flowing away, the rivers, run which they
released from their restraint.  
9 O Indra, many are thine aids, many thy ways of guiding us,  
Lord of the Bay Steeds, Hinva's Son. To a Good Hero come our prayers,
which soon shall have accomplishment.  
10 Inspire him with your holy hymns, the Hero bright and glorious,  
Him who with might demolisheth even the brood of Śuṣṇa, and winneth for
us the heavenly streams.  
11 Inspire him worshipped with fair rites, the glorious Hero truly
brave.  
He brake in pieces Śuṣṇa's brood who still expected not the stroke, and
won for us the heavenly streams. Let all the others die away.  
12 Thus have we sung anew to Indra-Agni, as sang our sires, Aṅgirases,
and Mandhātar.  
Guard us with triple shelter and preserve us: may we be masters of a
store of riches.
