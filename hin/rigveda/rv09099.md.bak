### HYMN XCIX. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THEY for the Bold and Lovely One ply manly vigour like a bow:  
joyous, in front of songs they weave bright raiment for the Lord
Divine.  
2 And he, made beautiful by night, dips forward into strengthening
food',  
What time the sacrificer's thoughts speed on his way the Golden-hued.  
3 We cleanse this gladdening drink of his the juice which Indra chiefly
drinks—-  
That which kine took into their mouths, of old, and princes take it
now.  
4 To him, while purifying, they have raised the ancient psalm of
praise:  
And sacred songs which bear the names of Gods have supplicated him.  
5 They purify him as he drops, courageous, in the fleecy sieve.  
Him they instruct as messenger to bear the sage's morning prayer.  
6 Soma, best Cheerer, takes his seat, the while they cleanse him in the
bowls.  
He as it were impregns the cow, and babbles on, the Lord of Song.  
7 He is effused and beautified, a God for Gods, by skilful men.  
He penetrates the mighty floods collecting all he knows therein.  
8 Pressed, Indu, guided by the men, thou art led to the cleaning
sieve.  
Thou, yielding Indra highest joy, takest thy seat within the bowls.
