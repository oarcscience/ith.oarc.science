### HYMN XXVIII. Indra, Etc.

1 THERE where the broad-based stone raised on high to press the juices
out,  
O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.  
2 Where, like broad hips, to hold the juice the platters of the press
are laid,  
O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.  
3 There where the woman marks and leans the pestle's constant rise and
fall,  
O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.  
4 Where, as with reins to guide a horse, they bind the churning-staff
with cords,  
O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.  
5 If of a truth in every house, O Mortar thou art set for work,  
Here give thou forth thy clearest sound, loud as the drum of
conquerors.  
6 O Sovran of the Forest, as the wind blows soft in front of thee,  
Mortar, for Indra press thou forth the Soma juice that he may drink.  
7 Best strength-givers, ye stretch wide jaws, O Sacrificial
Implements,  
Like two bay horses champing herbs.  
8 Ye Sovrans of the Forest, both swift, with swift pressers press
to-day  
Sweet Soma juice for Indra's drink.  
9 Take up in beakers what remains: the Soma on the filter pour,  
and on the ox-hide set the dregs.
