### HYMN XXVI. Indra.

1\. I WAS aforetime Manu, I was Sūrya: I am the sage Kakṣīvān, holy
singer.  
Kutsa the son of Ārjuni I master. I am the sapient Uśanā behold me.  
2 I have bestowed the earth upon the Ārya, and rain upon the man who
brings oblation.  
I guided forth the loudly-roaring waters, and the Gods moved according
to my pleasure.  
3 In the wild joy of Soma I demolished Śambara's forts, ninety-and-nine,
together;  
And, utterly, the hundredth habitation, when helping Divodāsa
Atithigva.  
4 Before all birds be ranked this Bird, O Maruts; supreme of falcons be
this fleet-winged Falcon,  
Because, strong- pinioned, with no car to bear him, he brought to Manu
the Godloved oblation.  
5 When the Bird brought it, hence in rapid motion sent on the wide path
fleet as thought he hurried.  
Swift he returned with sweetness of the Soma, and hence the Falcon hath
acquired his glory.  
6 Bearing the stalk, the Falcon speeding onward, Bird bringing from afar
the draught that gladdens,  
Friend of the Gods, brought, grasping fast, the Soma which be bad taken
from yon loftiest heaven.  
7 The Falcon took and brought the Soma, bearing thousand libations with
him, yea, ten thousand.  
The Bold One left Malignities behind him, wise, in wild joy of Soma,
left the foolish.
