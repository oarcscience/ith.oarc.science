### HYMN XXXIII. Ṛbhus.

1\. I SEND my voice as herald to the Ṛbhus; I crave the white cow for
the overspreading.  
Wind-sped, the Skillful Ones in rapid motion have in an instant
compassed round the heaven.  
2 What time the Rbus had with care and marvels done proper service to
assist their Parents,  
They won the friendship of the Gods; the Sages carried away the fruit of
their devotion.  
3 May they who made their Parents, who were lying like posts that
moulder, young again for ever,—  
May Vāja, Vibhvan, Ṛbhu, joined with Indra , protect our sacrifice, the
Soma-lovers.  
4 As for a year the Ṛbhus kept the Milch-cow, throughout a year
fashioned and formed her body,  
And through a year's space still sustained her brightness, through these
their labours they were made immortal.  
5 Two beakers let us make,—thus said the eldest. Let us make three,—this
was the younger's sentence.  
Four beakers let us make,—thus spoke the youngest. Tvaṣṭar approved this
rede of yours, O Ṛbhus.  
6 The men spake truth and even so they acted: this Godlike way of theirs
the Ṛbhus followed.  
And Tvaṣṭar, when he looked on the four beakers resplendent as the day,
was moved with envy.  
7 When for twelve days the Ṛbhus joyed reposing as guests of him who
never may be hidden,  
They made fair fertile fields, they brought the rivers. Plants spread
o’er deserts, waters filled the hollows.  
8 May they who formed the swift car, bearing Heroes, and the Cow
omniform and all-impelling,  
Even may they form wealth for us,—the Ṛbhus, dexterous-handed, deft in
work and gracious.  
9 So in their work the Gods had satisfaction, pondering it with thought
and mental insight.  
The Gods’ expert artificer was Vāja, Indra's Ṛbhukṣan, Varuṇa's was
Vibhvan.  
10 They who made glad with sacrifice and praises, wrought the two Bays,
his docile Steeds, for Indra,—  
Ṛbhus, as those who wish a friend to prosper, bestow upon us gear and
growth of riches.  
11 This day have they set gladdening drink before you. Not without toil
are Gods inclined to friendship.  
Therefore do ye who are so great, O Ṛbhus, vouchsafe us treasures at
this third libation.
