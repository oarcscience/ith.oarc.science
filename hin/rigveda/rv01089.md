### HYMN LXXXIX. Viśvedevas.

1\. MAY powers auspicious come to us from every side, never deceived,
unhindered, and victorious,  
That the Gods ever may be with us for our gain, our guardians day by day
unceasing in their care.  
2 May the auspicious favour of the Gods be ours, on us descend the
bounty of the righteous Gods.  
The friendship of the Gods have we devoutly sought: so may the Gods
extend our life that we may live.  
3 We call them hither with a hymn of olden time, Bhaga, the friendly
Dakṣa, Mitra, Aditi,  
Aryaman, Varuṇa, Soma, the Aśvins. May Sarasvatī, auspicious, grant
felicity.  
4 May the Wind waft to us that pleasant medicine, may Earth our Mother
give it, and our Father Heaven,  
And the joy-giving stones that press the Soma's juice. Aśvins, may ye,
for whom our spirits long, hear this.  
5 Him we invoke for aid who reigns supreme, the Lord of all that stands
or moves, inspirer of the soul,  
That Pūṣan may promote the increase of our wealth, our keeper and our
guard infallible for our good.  
6 Illustrious far and wide, may Indra prosper us: may Pūṣan prosper us,
the Master of all wealth.  
May Tārkṣya with uninjured fellies prosper us: Bṛhaspati vouchsafe to us
prosperity.  
7 The Maruts, Sons of Pṛśni, borne by spotted steeds, moving in glory,
oft visiting holy rites,  
Sages whose tongue is Agni, brilliant as the Sun,—hither let all the
Gods for our protection come.  
8 Gods, may we with our ears listen to what is good, and with our eyes
see what is good, ye Holy Ones.  
With limbs and bodies firm may we extolling you attain the term of life
appointed by the Gods.  
9 A hundred autumns stand before us, O ye Gods, within whose space ye
bring our bodies to decay;  
Within whose space our sons become fathers in turn. Break ye not in the
midst our course of fleeting life.  
10 Aditi is the heaven, Aditi is mid-air, Aditi is the Mother and the
Sire and Son.  
Aditi is all Gods, Aditi five-classed men, Aditi all that hath been born
and shall be born.
