### HYMN XXVIII. Viśvedevas.

1\. THE Thirty Gods and Three besides, whose seat hath been the sacred
grass,  
From time of old have found and gained.  
2 Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, Agnis, with Consorts, sending boons,  
To whom our Vaṣaṭ! is addressed:  
3 These are our guardians in the west, and northward here, and in the
south,  
And on the cast, with all the tribe.  
4 Even as the Gods desire so verily shall it be. None minisheth this
power of theirs,  
No demon, and no mortal  
5 The Seven carry seven spears; seven are the splendours they possess,  
And seven the glories they assume.
