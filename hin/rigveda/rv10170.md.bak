### HYMN CLXX. Sūrya.

1\. MAY the Bright God drink glorious Soma-mingled meath, giving the
sacrifice's lord uninjured life;  
He who, wind-urged, in person guards our offspring well, hath nourished
them with food and shines o’er many a land.  
2 Radiant, as high Truth, cherished, best at winning strength, Truth
based upon the statute that supports the heavens,  
He rose, a light, that kills Vṛtras and enemies, best slayer of the
Dasyus, Asuras, and foes.  
3 This light, the best of lights, supreme, all-conquering, winner of
riches, is exalted with high laud.  
All-lighting, radiant, mighty as the Sun to see, he spreadeth wide
unfailing victory and strength.  
4 Beaming forth splendour with thy light, thou hast attained heaven's
lustrous realm.  
By thee were brought together all existing things, possessor of all
Godhead, All-effecting God.
