### HYMN CIL Soma Pavamana.

1\. THE Child, when blended with the streams, speeding the plan of
sacrifice,  
Surpasses all things that are dear, yea, from of old.  
2 The place, near the two pressing-stones of Trita, hath he occupied,  
Secret and dear through seven lights of sacrifice.  
3 Urge to three courses, on the heights of Trita, riches in a stream.  
He who is passing wise measures his courses out.  
4 Even at his birth the Mothers Seven taught him, for glory, like a
sage,  
So that he, firm and sure, hath set his mind on wealth.  
5 Under his sway, of one accord, are all the guileless Deities:  
Warriors to be envied, they, when they are pleased.  
6 The Babe whom they who strengthen Law have generated fair to see,  
Much longed for at the sacrifice, most liberal Sage,—  
7 To him, united, of themselves, come the young Parents of the rite,  
When they adorn him, duly weaving sacrifice.  
8 With wisdom and with radiant eyes unbar to us the stall of heaven,  
Speeding at solemn rite the plan of Holy Law.
