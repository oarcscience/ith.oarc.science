### HYMN XXXIV. Maruts

1\. THE Maruts of resistless might who love the rain, resplendent,
terrible like wild beasts in their strength,  
Glowing like flames of fire, impetuous in career, blowing the wandering
rain-cloud, have disclosed the kine.  
2 They gleam with armlets as the heavens are decked with stars, like
cloud-born lightnings shine the torrents of their rain.  
Since the strong Rudra, O Maruts with brilliant chests, sprang into life
for you in Pṛśni's radiant lap.  
3 They drip like horses in the racings of swift steeds; with the
stream's rapid cars they hasten on their way.  
Maruts with helms of gold, ye who make all things shake,
[come](errata.htm#12.md) with your spotted deer, one-minded, to our food.  
4 They have bestowed of Mitra all that live, to feed, they who for
evermore cause their swift drops to flow;  
Whose steeds are spotted deer, whose riches never fail, like horses in
full speed, bound to the pole in work.  
5 With brightly-flaming kine whose udders swell with milk, with
glittering lances on your unobstructed paths,  
O Maruts, of one mind, like swans who seek their nests, come to the
rapturous enjoyment of the meath.  
6 To these our prayers, O Maruts, come unanimous, come ye to our
libations like the praise of men.  
Make it swell like a mare, in udder like a cow, and for the singer grace
the song with plenteous strength.  
7 Give us a steed, O Maruts mighty in the car; prevailing prayer that
brings remembrance day by day;  
Food to your praisers, to your bard in deeds of might give winning
wisdom, power uninjured, unsurpassed.  
8 When the bright-chested Maruts, lavish of their gifts, bind at the
time bliss their horses to the cars,  
Then, as the milch-cow feeds her calf within the stalls, they pour forth
food for all oblation-bringing men.  
9 Save us, O Maruts, Vasus, from the injurer, the mortal foe who makes
us looked upon as wolves.  
With chariot all aflame compass him round about: O Rudras, cast away the
foeman's deadly bolt.  
10 Well-known, ye Maruts, is that wondrous course of yours, when they
milked Pṛśni's udder, close akin to her.  
Or when to shame the bard who lauded, Rudra's Sons, ye O infallible
brought Trita to decay.  
11 We call you such, great Maruts, following wonted ways, to the
oblation paid to Viṣṇu Speeder-on.  
With ladles lifted up, with prayer, we seek of them preeminent,
golden-hued, the wealth which all extol.  
12 They, the Daśagvas, first of all brought sacrifice: they at the break
of mornings shall inspirit us.  
Dawn with her purple beams uncovereth the nights, with great light
glowing like a billowy sea of milk.  
13 The Rudras have rejoiced them in the gathered bands at seats of
worship as in purple ornaments.  
They with impetuous vigour sending down the rain have taken to
themselves a bright and lovely hue.  
14 Soliciting their high protection for our help, with this our
adoration we sing praise to them,  
Whom, for assistance, like the five terrestrial priests. Trita hath
brought to aid us hither on his car.  
15 So may your favouring help be turned to us-ward, your kindness like a
lowing cow approach us,  
Wherewith ye bear your servant over trouble, and free your worshipper
from scoff and scorning.
