### HYMN CV. Soma Pavamana

1\. SING; ye aloud, O friends, to him who makes him pure for gladdening
drink:  
They shall make sweet the Child with sacrifice and laud.  
2 Like as a calf with mother cows, so Indu is urged forth and sent,  
Glorified by our hymns, the God-delighting juice.  
3 Effectual means of power is he, he is a banquet for the Troop,  
He who hath been effused, most rich in meath, for Gods.  
4 Flow to us, Indu, passing, strong, effused, with wealth of kine and
steeds:  
I will spread forth above the milk thy radiant hue.  
5 Lord of the tawny, Indu thou who art the God's most special food,  
As Friend to friend, for splendour be thou good to men.  
6 Drive utterly, far away from us each godless, each voracious foe.  
O Indu, overcome and drive the false afar.
