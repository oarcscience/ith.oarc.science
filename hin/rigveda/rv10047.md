### HYMN XLVII. Indra Vaikuntha.

1\. THY right hand have we grasped in ours, O Indra, longing for
treasure, Treasure-Lord of treasures!  
Because we know thee, Hero, Lord of cattle: vouchsafe us mighty and
resplendent riches.  
2 Wealth, fully armed, good guard and kind protector, sprung from four
seas, the prop and stay of treasures,  
Fraught with great bounties, meet for praise and glory; vouchsafe us
mighty and resplendent riches.  
3 Wealth, with good Brahmans, Indra! God-attended, high, wide, and deep,
arid based on broad foundations,  
Strong, with famed Ṛṣis, conquering our foemen: vouchsafe us mighty and
resplendent riches.  
4 Victorious, winning strength, with hero sages, confirmed in power,
most useful, wealth-attracting,  
True, Indra! crushing forts and slaying Dasyus: vouchsafe us mighty and
resplendent riches.  
5 Wealthy in heroes and in cars and horses, strength hundredfold and
thousandfold, O Indra,  
With manly sages, happy troops, Iight-winning: vouchsafe us mighty and
resplentdent riches.  
6 To Saptagu the sage, the holy-minded, to him, Bṛhaspati, the song
approaches,  
Aṅgiras' Son who must be met with homage: vouchsafe us mighty and
reslendent riches.  
7 My lauds, like envoys, craving loving-kindness, go forth to Indra with
their strong entreaty,  
Moving his heart and uttered by my spirit: vouchsafe us mighty and
resplendent riches.  
8 Grant us the boon for which I pray, O Indra, a spacious home unmatched
among the people.  
To this may Heaven and Earth accord approval: vouchsafe us mighty and
resplendent riches.
