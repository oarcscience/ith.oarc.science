### HYMN XV. Agni.

1\. OFFER oblations in his mouth, the bounteous God's whom we must
serve.  
His who is nearest kin to us:  
2 Who for the Fivefold People's take hath seated him in every home  
Wise, Youthful, Master of the house.  
3 On all sides may that Agni guard our household folk and property;  
May he deliver us from woe.  
4 I have begotten this new hymn for Agni, Falcon of the sky:  
Will he not give us of his wealth?  
5 Whose lories when he glows in front of sacrite are fair to see,  
Like wealth of one with hero sons.  
6 May he enjoy this hallowed gift, Agni accept our songs, who bears  
Oblations, best of worshippers.  
7 Lord of the house, whom men must seek, we set thee down, O Worshipped
Onel  
Bright, rich in heroes, Agni! God  
8 Shine forth at night and morn: through thee with fires are we provided
well.  
Thou, rich in heroes, art our Friend.  
9 The men come near thee for their gain, the singers with their songs of
praise:  
Speech, thousandfold, comes near to thee.  
10 Bright, Purifier, meet for praise, Immortal with refulgent glow,  
Agni drives Rākṣasas away.  
11 As such, bring us abundant wealth, young Child of Strength, for this
thou canst  
May Bhaga give us what is choice.  
12 Thou, Agni, givest hero fame: Bhaga and Savitar the God,  
And Did give us what is good.  
13 Agni, preserve us from distress: consume our enemies, O God,  
Eternal, with the hottest flames.  
14 And, irresistible, be thou a mighty iron fort to us,  
With hundred walls for man's defence.  
15 Do thou preserve us, eve and morn, from sorrow, from the wicked
men,  
Infallible! by day and night.
