### HYMN LXXXII. Manyu.

1\. HE who hath reverenced thee, Manyu, destructive bolt, breeds for
himself forthwith all conquering energy.  
Ārya and Dāsa will we conquer with thine aid, with thee the Conqueror,
with conquest conquest-sped.  
2 Manyu was Indra, yea, the God, was Manyu, Manyu was Hotar, Varuṇa,
Jātavedas.  
The tribes of human lineage worship Manyu. Accordant with thy fervour,
Manyu, guard us.  
3 Come hither, Manyu, mightier tham the mighty; chase, with thy fervour
for ally, our foemen.  
Slayer of foes, of Vṛtra, and of Dasyu, bring thou to us all kinds of
wealth and treasure.  
4 For thou art, Manyu, of surpassing vigour, fierce, queller of the foe,
and self-existent,  
Shared by all men, victorious, subduer: vouchsafe to us superior
strengith in battles.  
5 I have departed, still without a portion, wise God! according to thy
will, the Mighty.  
I, feeble man, was wroth thee, O Manyu I am myself; come thou to give me
vigour.  
6 Come hither. I am all thine own; advancing turn thou to me,
Victorious, All-supporter!  
Come to me, Manyu, Wielder of the Thunder: bethink thee of thy friend,
and slay the Dasyus.  
7 Approach, and on my right hand hold thy station: so shall we slay a
multitude of foemen.  
The best of meath I offer to support thee: may we be first to drink
thereof in quiet.
