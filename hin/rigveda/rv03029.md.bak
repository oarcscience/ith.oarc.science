### HYMN XXIX. Agni.

1\. HERE is the gear for friction, here tinder made ready for the
spark.  
Bring thou the Matron: we will rub Agni in ancient fashion forth.  
2 1n the two fire-sticks Jātavedas lieth, even as the well-set germ in
pregnant women,  
Agni who day by day must be exalted by men who watch and worship with
oblations.  
3 Lay this with care on that which lies extended: straight hath she
borne the Steer when made prolific.  
With his red pillar—radiant is his splendour—in our skilled task is born
the Son of Iḷā.  
4 In Iḷā's place we set thee down, upon the central point of earth,  
That, Agni Jātavedas, thou mayst bear our offerings to the Gods.  
5 Rub into life, ye men, the Sage, the guileless, Immortal, very wise
and fair to look on.  
O men, bring forth the most propitious Agni, first ensign of the
sacrifice to eastward.  
6 When with their arms they rub him straight he shineth forth like a
strong courser, red in colour, in the wood.  
Bright, checkless, as it were upon the Aśvins' path, he passeth by the
stones and burneth up the grass.  
7 Agni shines forth when born, observant, mighty, the bountiful, the
Singer praised by sages;  
Whom, as adorable and knowing all things, Gods set at solemn rites as
offering-bearer.  
8 Set thee, O Priest, in, thine own place, observant: lay down the
sacrifice in the home of worship.  
Thou, dear to Gods, shalt serve them with oblation: Agni, give long life
to the sacrificer.  
9 Raise ye a mighty smoke, my fellow-workers! Ye shall attain to wealth
without obstruction.  
This Agni is the battle-winning Hero by whom the Gods have overcome the
Dasyus.  
10 This is thine ordered place of birth whence sprung to life thou
shonest forth.  
Knowing this, Agni, sit thee down, and prosper thou the songs we sing.  
11 As Germ Celestial he is called Tanūnapāt, and Narāśaṁsa born diffused
in varied shape.  
Formed in his Mother he is Mātariśvan; he hath, in his course, become
the rapid flight of wind.  
12 With strong attrition rubbed to life, laid down with careful hand, a
Sage,  
Agni, make sacrifices good, and for the pious bring the Gods.  
13 Mortals have brought to life the God Immortal, the Conqueror with
mighty jaws, unfailing.  
The sisters ten, unwedded and united, together grasp the Babe, the
new-born Infant.  
14 Served by the seven priests, he shone forth from ancient time, when
in his Mother's bosom, in her lap, he glowed.  
Giving delight each day he closeth not his eye, since from the Asura's
body hewas brought to life.  
15 Even as the Maruts, onslaughts who attack the foe, those born the
first of all knew the full power of prayer.  
The Kuśikas have made the glorious hymn ascend, and, each one singly in
his home, have kindled fire.  
16 As we, O Priest observant, have elected thee this day, what time the
solemn sacrifice began,  
So surely hast thou worshipped, surely hast thou toiled: come thou unto
the Soma, wise and knowing all.
