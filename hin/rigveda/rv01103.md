### HYMN CIII. Indra.

1\. THAT highest Indra-power of thine is distant: that which is here
sages possessed aforetime.  
This one is on the earth, in heaven the other, and both unite as flag
with flag in battle.  
2 He spread the wide earth out and firmly fixed it, smote with his
thunderbolt and loosed the waters.  
Maghavan with his puissance struck down Ahi, rent Rauhiṇa to death and
slaughtered Vyaṁsa.  
3 Armed with his bolt and trusting in his prowess he wandered shattering
the forts of Dāsas.  
Cast thy dart, knowing, Thunderer, at the Dasyu; increase the Ārya's
might and glory, Indra.  
4 For him who thus hath taught these human races, Maghavan, bearing a
fame-worthy title,  
Thunderer, drawing nigh to slay the Dasyus, hath given himself the name
of Son for glory.  
5 See this abundant wealth that he possesses, and put your trust in
Indra's hero vigour.  
He found the cattle, and he found the horses, he found the plants, the
forests and the waters.  
6 To him the truly strong, whose deeds are many, to him the strong Bull
let us pour the Soma.  
The Hero, watching like a thief in ambush, goes parting the possessions
of the godless.  
7 Well didst thou do that hero deed, O Indra, in waking with thy bolt
the slumbering Ahi.  
in thee, delighted, Dames divine rejoiced them, the flying Maruts and
all Gods were joyful.  
8 As thou hast smitten Śuṣṇa, Pipru, Vṛtra and Kuyava, and Śambara's
forts, O Indra.  
This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu,
Earth and Heaven.
