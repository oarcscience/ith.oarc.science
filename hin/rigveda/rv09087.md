### HYMN LXXXVII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. RUN onward to the reservoir and seat thee: cleansed by the men speed
forward to the battle.  
Making thee beauteous like an able courser, forth to the sacred grass
with reins they lead thee.  
2 Indu, the well-armed God, is flowing onward, who quells the curse and
guards from treacherous onslaught,  
Father, begetter of the Gods, most skilful, the buttress of the heavens
and earth's supporter.  
3. Ṛṣi and Sage, the Champion of the people, cleft and sagacious, Uśanā
in wisdom,  
He hath discovered even their hidden nature, the Cows' concealed and
most mysterious title.  
4 This thine own Soma rich in meath, O Indra, Steer for the Steer, hath
flowed into the filter.  
The strong Free-giver, winning hundreds, thousands, hath reached the
holy grass that never fails him.  
5 These Somas are for wealth of countless cattle, renown therefor, and
mighty strength immortal.  
These have been sent forth, urified by strainers, like steeds who rusg
to battle fain for glory.  
6 He, while he cleanses him, invoked of many, hath flowed to give the
people all enjoyment.  
Thou whom the Falcon brought, bring, dainty viands, bestir thyself and
send us wealth and booty.  
7 This Soma, pressed into the cleansing filter, hath run as ’twere a
host let loose, the Courser;  
Like a strong bull who whets his horns kpen-pointed, like a brave
warrior in the fray for cattle.  
8 He issued forth from out the loftiest mountain, and found kine hidden
somewhere in a stable.  
Soma's stream clears itself for thee, O Indra, like lightning thundering
through the clouds of heaven,  
9 Cleansing thyselr, and borne along with Indra, Soma, thou goest round
the herd of cattle.  
May thy praise help us, Mighty One, prompt Giver, to the full ample food
which thou bestowest.
