### HYMN XXXI. Agni.

1 Thou, Agni, wast the earliest Aṅgiras, a Seer; thou wast, a God
thyself, the Gods’ auspicious Friend.  
After thy holy ordinance the Maruts, sage, active through wisdom, with
their glittering spears, were born.  
2 O Agni, thou, the best and earliest Aṅgiras, fulfillest as a Sage the
holy law of Gods.  
Sprung from two mothers, wise, through all existence spread, resting in
many a place for sake of living man.  
3 To Mātariśvan first thou, Agni, wast disclosed, and to Vivasvān
through thy noble inward power.  
Heaven and Earth, Vasu! shook at the choosing of the Priest: the burthen
thou didst bear, didst worship mighty Gods.  
4 Agni thou madest heaven to thunder for mankind; thou, yet more pious,
for pious Purūravas.  
When thou art rapidly freed from thy parents, first eastward they bear
thee round, and, after, to the west.  
5 Thou, Agni, art a Bull who makes our store increase, to be invoked by
him who lifts the ladle up.  
Well knowing the oblation with the hallowing word, uniting all who live,
thou lightenest first our folk  
6 Agni, thou savest in the synod when pursued e’en him, farseeing One!
who walks in evil ways.  
Thou, when the heroes fight for spoil which men rush, round, slayest in
war the many by the hands of few.  
7 For glory, Agni, day by day, thou liftest up the mortal man to highest
immortality,  
Even thou who yearning for both races givest them great bliss, and to
the prince grantest abundant food.  
8 O Agni, highly lauded, make our singer famous that he may win us store
of riches:  
May we improve the rite with new performance. O Earth and Heaven, with
all the Gods, protect us.  
9 O blameless Agni lying in thy Parents' lap, a God among the Gods, be
watchful for our good.  
Former of bodies, be the singer's Providence: all good things hast thou
sown for him, auspicious One!  
10 Agni, thou art our Providence, our Father thou: we are thy brethren
and thou art our spring of life.  
In thee, rich in good heroes, guard of high decrees, meet hundred,
thousand treasures, O infallible!  
11 Thee, Agni, have the Gods made the first living One for living man,
Lord of the house of Nahuṣa.  
Iḷā they made the teacher of the sons of men, what time a Son was born
to the father of my race.  
12 Worthy to be revered, O Agni, God, preserve our wealthy patrons with
thy succours, and ourselves.  
Guard of our seed art thou, aiding our cows to bear, incessantly
protecting in thy holy way.  
13 Agni, thou art a guard close to the pious man; kindled art thou,
four-eyed! for him who is unarmed.  
With fond heart thou acceptest e’en the poor man's prayer, when he hath
brought his gift to gain security.  
14 Thou, Agni gainest for the loudly-praising priest the highest wealth,
the object of a man's desire.  
Thou art called Father, caring even for the weak, and wisest, to the
simple one thou teachest lore.  
15 Agni, the man who giveth guerdon to the priests, like well-sewn
armour thou guardest on every side.  
He who with grateful food shows kindness in his house, an offerer to the
living, is the type of heaven.  
16 Pardon, we pray, this sin of ours, O Agni,—the path which we have
trodden, widely straying,  
Dear Friend and Father, caring for the pious, who speedest nigh and who
inspirest mortals.  
17 As erst to Manus, to Yayāti, Aṅgiras, so Aṅgiras! pure Agni! come
thou to our hall.  
Bring hither the celestial host and seat them here upon the sacred
grass, and offer what they love.  
18 By this our prayer be thou, O Agni, strengthened, prayer made by us
after our power and knowledge.  
Lead thou us, therefore, to increasing riches; endow us with thy
strength-bestowing favour.
