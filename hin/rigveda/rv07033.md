### HYMN XXXIII Vasiṣṭha.

1\. THESE who wear hair-knots on the right, the movers of holy thought,
white-robed, have won me over.  
I warned the men, when from the grass I raised me, Not from afar can my
Vasisthas help you.  
2 With [Soma](errata.htm#18) they brought Indra from a distance, Over
Vaisanta, from the strong libation.  
Indra preferred Vasisthas to the Soma pressed by the son of Vayata,
Pasadyumna.  
3 So, verily, with these he crossed the river, in company with these he
slaughtered Bheda.  
So in the fight with the Ten Kings, Vasisthas! did Indra help Sudās
through your devotions.  
4 I gladly, men I with prayer prayed by our fathers have fixed your
axle: ye shall not be injured:  
Since, when ye sang aloud the Sakvari verses, Vasisthas! ye invigorated
Indra.  
5 Like thirsty men they looked to heaven, in battle with the Ten Kings,
surrounded and imploring.  
Then Indra heard Vasiṣṭha as he praised him, and gave the Trtsus ample
room and freedom.  
6 Like sticks and staves wherewith they drive the cattle, Stripped bare,
the Bharatas were found defenceless:  
Vasiṣṭha then became their chief and leader: then widely. were the
Trtsus' clans extended.  
7 Three fertilize the worlds with genial moisture: three noble Creatures
cast a light before them.  
Three that give warmth to all attend the morning. All these have they
discovered, these Vasisthas.  
8 Like the Sun's growing glory is their splendour, and like the sea's is
their unflathomed greatness.  
Their course is like the wind's. Your laud, Vasisthas, can never be
attained by any other.  
9 They with perceptions of the heart in secret resort to that which
spreads a thousand branches.  
The Apsaras brought hither the Vasisthas wearing the vesture spun for
them by Yama.  
10 A form of lustre springing from the lightning wast thou, when Varuṇa
and Mitra saw thee.  
Tliy one and only birth was then, Vasiṣṭha, when from thy stock Agastya
brought thee hither.  
11 Born of their love for Urvasi, Vasiṣṭha thou, priest, art son of
Varuṇa and Mitra;  
And as a fallen drop, in heavenly fervour, all the Gods laid thee on a
lotus-blossorn.  
12 He thinker, knower both of earth and heaven, endowed with many a
gift, bestowing thousands,  
Destined to wear the vesture spun by Yama, sprang from the Apsaras to
life, Vasiṣṭha.  
13 Born at the sacrifice, urged by adorations, both with a common flow
bedewed the pitcher.  
Then from the midst thereof there rose up Māna, and thence they say was
born the sage Vasiṣṭha.  
14 He brings the bearer of the laud and Sāman: first shall he speak
bringing the stone for pressing.  
With grateful hearts in reverence approach him: to you, O Pratrdas,
Vasiṣṭha cometh.
