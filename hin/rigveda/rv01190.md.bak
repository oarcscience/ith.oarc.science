### HYMN CXC. Bṛhaspati.

1\. GLORIFY thou Bṛhaspati, the scatheless, who must be praised with
hymns, sweet-tongued and mighty,  
To whom as leader of the song, resplendent, worthy of lauds, both Gods
and mortals listen.  
2 On him wait songs according to the season even as a stream of pious
men set moving.  
Bṛhaspati—for he laid out the expanses—was, at the sacrifice, vast
Mātariśvan.  
3 The praise, the verse that offers adoration, may he bring forth, as
the Sun sends his arms out,  
He who gives daily light through this God's wisdom, strong as a dread
wild beast, and inoffensive.  
4 His song of praise pervades the earth and heaven: let the wise
worshipper draw it, like a courser.  
These of Bṛhaspati, like hunters' arrows, go to the skies that change
their hue like serpents.  
5 Those, God, who count thee as a worthless bullock, and, wealthy
sinners, live on thee the Bounteous,—  
On fools like these no blessing thou bestowest: Bṛhaspati, thou
punishest the spiteful.  
6 Like a fair path is he, where grass is pleasant, though hard to win, a
Friend beloved most early.  
Those who unharmed by enemies behold us, while they would make them
bare, stood closely compassed.  
7 He to whom songs of praise go forth like torrents, as rivers eddying
under banks flow sea-ward—  
Bṛhaspati the wise, the eager, closely looks upon both, the waters and
the vessel.  
8 So hath Bṛhaspati, great, strong and mighty, the God exceeding
powerful, been brought hither.  
May he thus lauded give us kine and horses. May we find strengthening
food in full abundance.
