### HYMN XLVIII. Soma.

1\. WISELY have I enjoyed the savoury viand, religious-thoughted, best
to find out treasure,  
The food to which all Deities and mortals, calling it meath, gather
themselves together.  
2 Tlou shalt be Aditi as thou hast entered within, appeaser of celestial
anger.  
Indu, enjoying Indra's friendship, bring us—as a swift steed the
car—forward to riches.  
3 We have drunk Soma and become immortal; we have attained the light,
the Gods discovered.  
Now what may foeman's malice do to harm us? What, O Immortal, mortal
man's deception?  
4 Absorbed into the heart, be sweet, O Indu, as a kind father to his
son, O Soma,  
As a wise Friend to friend: do thou, wide-ruler, O Soma, lengthen out
our days for living.  
5 These glorious drops that give me freedom have I drunk. Closely they
knit my joints as straps secure a car.  
Let them protect my foot from slipping on the way: yea, let the drops I
drink preserve me from disease.  
6 Make me shine bright like fire produced by friction: give us a clearer
sight and make us better.  
For in carouse I think of thee, O Soma, Shall I, as a rich man, attain
to comfort?  
7 May we enjoy with an enlivened spirit the juice thou givest, like
ancestral riches.  
O Soma, King, prolong thou our existence as Sūrya makes the shining days
grow longer.  
8 King Soma, favour us and make us prosper: we are thy devotees; of this
be mindful.  
Spirit and power are fresh in us, O Indu give us not up unto our
foeman's pleasure.  
9 For thou hast settled in each joint, O Soma, aim of men's eyes and
guardian of our bodies.  
When we offend against thine holy statutes, as a kind Friend, God, best
of all, be gracious.  
10 May I be with the Friend whose heart is tender, who, Lord of Bays!
when quaffed will never harm me-  
This Soma now deposited within me. For this, I pray for longer life to
Indra.  
11 Our maladies have lost their strength and vanished: they feared, and
passed away into the darkness.  
Soma hath risen in us, exceeding mighty, and we are come where men
prolong existence.  
12, Fathers, that Indu which our hearts have drunken, Immortal in
himself, hath entered mortals.  
So let us serve this Soma with oblation, and rest securely in his grace
and favour.  
13 Associate with the Fathers thou, O Soma, hast spread thyself abroad
through earth and heaven.  
So with oblation let us serve thee, Indu, and so let us become the lords
of riches,  
14 Give us your blessing, O ye Gods’ preservers. Never may sleep or idle
talk control us.  
But evermore may we, as friends of Soma, speak to the synod with brave
sons around us.  
15 On all sides,. Soma, thou art our life-giver: aim of all eyes,
light-finder, come within us.  
Indu, of one accord with thy protections both from behind and from
before preserve us.
