*Rig Veda*, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, \[1896\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

### HYMN CLXXVI. Agni.

1\. WITH hymns of praise their sons have told aloud the Ṛbhus' mighty
deeds.  
Who, all-supporting, have enjoyed the earth as, twere a mother cow.  
2 Bring forth the God with song divine, being Jātavedas hitherward,  
To bear our gifts at once to heaven.  
3 He here, a God-devoted Priest, led forward comes to sacrifice.  
Like a car covered for the road, he, glowing, knows, himself, the way.  
4 This Agni rescues from distress, as ’twere from the Immortal Race,  
A God yet mightier than strength, a God who hath been made for life.
