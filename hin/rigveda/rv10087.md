### HYMN LXXXVII. Agni.

1\. I BALM with oil the mighty Rakṣas-slayer; to the most famous Friend
I come for shelter  
Enkindled, sharpened by our rites, may Agni protect us in the day and
night from evil.  
2 O Jātavedas with the teeth of iron, enkindled with thy flame attack
the demons.  
Seize with thy longue the foolish gods' adorers: rend, put within thy
mouth the raw-flesh caters.  
3 Apply thy teeth, the upper and the lower, thou who hast both,
enkindled and destroying.  
Roam also in the air, O King, around us, and with thy jaws assail the
wicked spirits.  
4 Bending thy shafts through sacrifices, Agni, whetting their points
with song as if with whetstones,  
Pierce to the heart therewith the Yātudhānas, and break their arms
uplifed to attack thee.  
5 Pierce through the Yātudhāna's skin, O Agni; let the destroying dart
with fire consume him.  
Rend his joints, Jātavedas, let the cater of flesh, flesh-seeking, track
his mangled body.  
6 Where now thou seest Agni Jātavedas, one of these demons standing
still or roaming,  
Or flying on those paths in air's midregion, sharpen the shaft and as an
archer pierce him.  
7 Tear from the evil spirit, Jātavedas, what he hath seized and with his
spears hath captured.  
Blazing before him strike him down, O Agni; let spotted carrion-eating
kites devour him.  
8 Here tell this forth, O Agni: whosoever is, he himself, or acteth as,
a demon,  
Him grasp, O thou Most Youthful, with thy fuel. to the Mati-seer's eye
give him as booty.  
9 With keen glance guard the sacrifice, O Agni: thou Sage, conduct it
onward to the Vasus.  
Let not the fiends, O Man-beholder, harm thee burning against the
Rākṣasas to slay them.  
10 Look on the fiend mid men, as Man-beholder: rend thou his three
extremities in pieces.  
Demolish with thy flame his ribs, O Agni, the Yātudhāna's root destroy
thou triply.  
11 Thrice, Agni, let thy noose surround the demon who with his falsehood
injures Holy Order.  
Loud roaring with thy flame, O Jātavedas, crush him and cast him down
before the singer.  
12 Lead thou the worshipper that eye, O Agni, wherewith thou lookest on
the hoof-armed demon.  
With light celestial in Atharvan's manner burn up the foot who ruins
truth with falsehood.  
13 Agni, what curse the pair this day have uttered, what heated word the
worshippers have spoken,  
Each arrowy taunt sped from the angry spirit,—pierce to the heart
therewith the Yātudhānas.  
14 With fervent heat exterminate the demons; destroy the fiends with
burning flame, O Agni.  
Destroy with fire the foolish gods' adorers; blaze and destrepy the
insatiable monsters.  
15 May Gods destroy this day the evil-doer may each hot curse of his
return and blast him.  
Let arrows pierce the liar in his vitals, and Visva's net enclose the
Yātudhāna.  
16 The fiend who smears himself with flesh of cattle, with flesh of
horses and of human bodies,  
Who steals the milch-cow's milk away, O Agni,—tear off the heads of such
with fiery fury.  
17 The cow gives milk each year, O Man-regarder: let not the Yātudhāna
ever taste it.  
If one would glut him with the biesting, Agni, pierce with thy flame his
vitals as he meets thee.  
18 Let the fiends drink the poison of the cattle; may Aditi cast off the
evildoers.  
May the God Savitar give them up to ruin, and be their share of plants
and herbs denied them.  
19 Agni, from days of old thou slayest demons: never shall Rākṣasas in
fight o’ercome thee.  
Burn up the foolish ones, the flesh-devourers: let none of them escape
thine heavenly arrow.  
20 Guard us, O Agni, from above and under, protect us fl-om behind us
and before us;  
And may thy flames, most fierce and never wasting, glowing with fervent
heat, consume the sinner.  
21 From rear, from front, from under, from above us, O King, protect us
as a Sage with wisdom.  
Guard to old age thy friend, O Friend, Eternal: O Agni, as Immortal,
guard us mortals.  
22 We set thee round us as a fort, victorious Agni, thee a Sage,  
Of hero lineage, day by day, destroyer of our treacherous foes.  
23 Burn with thy poison turned against the treacherous brood of
Rākṣasas,  
O Agni, with thy sharpened glow, with lances armed with points of
flame.  
24 Burn thou the paired Kimīdins, brun, Agni, the Yātudhāna pairs.  
I sharpen thee, Infallible, with hymns. O Sage, be vigilant.  
25 Shoot forth, O Agni, with thy flame demolish them on every side.  
Break thou the Yātudhāna's strength, the vigour of the Rākṣasa.
