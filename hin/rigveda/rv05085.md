### HYMN LXXXV. Varuṇa.

1\. SING forth a hymn sublime and solemn, grateful to glorious. Varuṇa,
imperial Ruler,  
Who hath struck out, like one who slays the victim, earth as a skin to
spread in front of Sūrya.  
2 In the tree-tops the air he hath extended, put milk in kine and
vigorous speed in horses,  
Set intellect in hearts, fire in the waters, Siurya in heaven and Soma
on the mountain.  
3 Varuṇa lets the big cask, opening downward, flow through the heaven
and earth and air's mid-region.  
Therewith the universe's Sovran waters earth as the shower of rain
bedews the barley.  
4 When Varuṇa is fain for milk he moistens the sky, the land, and earth
to her foundation.  
Then straight the mountains clothe them in the rain-cloud: the Heroes,
putting forth their vigour, loose them.  
5 I will declare this mighty deed of magic, of glorious Varuṇa the Lord
Immortal,  
Who standing in the firmament hath meted the earth out with the Sun as
with a measure.  
6 None, verily, hath ever let or hindered this the most wise God's
mighty deed of magic,  
Whereby with all their flood, the lucid rivers fill not one sea wherein
they pour their waters.  
7 If we have sinned against the man who loves us, have ever wronged a
brother, friend, or comrade,  
The neighbour ever with us, or a stranger, O Varuṇa, remove from us the
trespass.  
8 If we, as gamesters cheat at play, have cheated, done wrong
unwittingly or sinned of purpose,  
Cast all these sins away like loosened fetters, and, Varuṇa let us be
thine own beloved.
