### HYMN LVIII. Ghṛta.

1\. FORTH from the ocean sprang the wave of sweetness: together with the
stalk it turned to Amṛta,  
That which is holy oil's mysterious title: but the Gods’ tongue is truly
Amṛta's centre.  
2 Let us declare aloud the name of Ghṛta, and at this sacrifice hold it
up with homage.  
So let the Brahman hear the praise we utter. This hath the four-horned
Buffalo emitted.  
3 Four are his horns, three are the feet that bear him; his heads are
two, his hands are seven in number.  
Bound with a triple bond the Steer roars loudly: the mighty God hath
entered in to mortals.  
4 That oil in triple shape the Gods discovered laid down within the Cow,
concealed by Paṇis.  
Indra produced one shape, Sūrya another: by their own power they formed
the third from Vena.  
5 From inmost reservoir in countless channels flow down these rivers
which the foe beholds not.  
I look upon the streams of oil descending, and lo! the Golden Reed is
there among them.  
6 Like rivers our libations flow together, cleansing themselves in
inmost heart and spirit.  
The streams of holy oil pour swiftly downward like the wild beasts that
fly before the bowman.  
7 As rushing down the rapids of a river, flow swifter than the wind the
vigorous currents,  
The streams of oil in swelling fluctuation like a red courser bursting
through the fences.  
8 Like women at a gathering fair to look on and gently smiling, they
incline to Agni.  
The streams of holy oil attain the fuel, and Jātavedas joyfully receives
them.  
9 As maidens dock themselves with gay adornment to join the bridal
feast, I now behold them.  
Where Soma flows and sacrifice is ready, thither the streams of holy oil
are running.  
10 Send to our eulogy a herd of cattle bestow upon us excellent
possessions.  
Bear to the Gods the sacrifice we offer the streams of oil flow pure and
full of sweetness.  
11 The universe depends upon thy power and might within the sea, within
the heart, within all life.
