### HYMN CXIV. Viśvedevas.

1\. Two perfect springs of heat pervade the Threefold, and come for
their delight is Mātariśvan.  
Craving the milk of heaven the Gods are present: well do they know the
praisesong and the Sāman.  
2 The priests beard far away, as they are ordered, serve the three
Nirrtis, for well they know them.  
Sages have traced the cause that first produced them, dwelling in
distant and mysterious chambers.  
3 The Youthful One, well-shaped, with four locks braided, brightened
with oil, puts on the ordinances.  
Two Birds of mighty power are seated near her, there where the Deities
receive their portion.  
4 One of these Birds hath passed into the sea of air: thence he looks
round and views this universal world.  
With simple heart I have beheld him from anear: his Mother kisses him
and he returns her kiss.  
5 Him with fair wings though only One in nature, wise singers shape,
with songs, in many figures.  
While they at sacrifices fix the metres, they measure out twelve
chalices of Soma.  
6 While they arrange the four and six-and-thirty, and duly order, up to
twelve, the measures,  
Having disposed the sacrifice thoughtful sages send the Car forward with
the Rc and Sāman.  
7 The Chariot's majesties are fourteen others: seven sages lead it
onward with their Voices.  
Who will declare to us the ford Apnana, the path whereby they drink
first draughts of Soma?  
8 The fifteen lauds are in a thousand places that is as vast as heaven
and earth in measure.  
A thousand spots contain the mighty thousand. Vāk spreadeth forth as far
as Prayer extendeth.  
9 What sage hath learned the metres' application? Who hath gained Vāk,
the spirit's aim and object?  
Which ministering priest is called eighth Hero? Who then hath tracked
the two Bay Steeds of Indra?  
10 Yoked to his chariot-pole there stood the Coursers: they only travel
round earth's farthest limits.  
These, when their driver in his home is settled, receive the allotted
meed of their exertion.
