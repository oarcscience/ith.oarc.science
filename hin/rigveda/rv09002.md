### HYMN II. Soma Pavamana.

1\. Soma, flow on, inviting Gods, speed to the purifying cloth:  
Pass into Indra, as a Bull.  
2 As mighty food speed hitherward, Indu, as a most splendid Steer:  
Sit in thy place as one with strength.  
3 The well-loved meath was made to flow, the stream of the creative
juice  
ne Sage drew waters to himself.  
4 The mighty waters, yea, the floods accompany thee Mighty One,  
When thou wilt clothe thee with the milk.  
5 The lake is brightened in the floods. Soma, our Friend, heaven's prop
and stay,  
Falls on the purifying cloth.  
6 The tawny Bull hath bellowed, fair as mighty Mitra to behold:  
He shines together with the Sun.  
7 Songs, Indu, active in their might are beautified for thee,
wherewith  
Thou deckest thee for our delight.  
8 To thee who givest ample room we pray, to win the joyous draught:  
Great are the praise& due to thee.  
9 Indu as, Indra's Friend, on us pour with a stream of sweetness, like  
Parjanya sender of the rain.  
10 Winner of kine, Indu, art thou, winner of heroes, steeds, and
strength  
Primeval Soul of sacrifice.
