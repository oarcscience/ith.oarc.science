### HYMN CXXVII. Night.

1\. WITH all her eyes the Goddess Night looks forth approaching many a
spot:  
She hath put all her glories on.  
2 Immortal. she hath filled the waste, the Goddess hath filled height
and depth:  
She conquers darkness with her light.  
3 The Goddess as she comes hath set the Dawn her Sister in her place:  
And then the darkness vanishes.  
4 So favour us this night, O thou whose pathways we have visited  
As birds their nest upon the tree.  
5 The villagers have sought their homes, and all that walks and all that
flies,  
Even the falcons fain for prey.  
6 Keep off the she-wolf and the wolf, O Urmya, keep the thief away;  
Easy be thou for us to pass.  
7 Clearly hath she come nigh to me who decks the dark with richest
hues:  
O Morning, cancel it like debts.  
8 These have I brought to thee like kine. O Night, thou Child of Heaven,
accept  
This laud as for a conqueror.
