### HYMN VIII. Agni.

1\. O AGNI urged to strength, the men of old who loved the Law enkindled
thee,  
the Ancient, for their aid,  
Thee very bright, and holy, nourisher of all, most excellent, the Friend
and Master of the home.  
2 Thee, Agni, men have stablished as their guest of old, as Master of
the household, thee, with hair of flame;  
High-bannered, multiform, distributor of wealth, kind helper, good
protector, drier of the floods.  
3 The tribes of men praise thee, Agni, who knowest well burnt offerings,
the Discerner, lavishest of wealth,  
Dwelling in secret, Blest One! visible to all, loud-roaring, skilled in
worship, glorified with oil.  
4 Ever to thee, O Agni, as exceeding strong have we drawn nigh with
songs and reverence singing hymns.  
So be thou pleased with us, Aṅgiras! as a God enkindled by the noble
with man's goodly light.  
5 Thou, Agni! multiform, God who art lauded much! givest in every house
subsistence as of old.  
Thou rulest by thy might o’er food of many a sort: that light of thine
when blazing may not be opposed.  
6 The Gods, Most Youthful Agni, have made thee, inflamed, the bearer of
oblations and the messenger.  
Thee, widely-reaching, homed in sacred oil, invoked, effulgent, have
they made the Eye that stirs the thought.  
7 Men seeking joy have lit thee worshipped from of old, O Agni, with
good fuel and with sacred oil.  
So thou, bedewed and waxing mighty by the plants, spreadest thyself
abroad over the realms of earth.
