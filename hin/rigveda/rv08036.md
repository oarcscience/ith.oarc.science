### HYMN XXXVI. Indra.

1\. THOU helpest him whose grass is trimmed, who sheds the juice, O
Śatakratu, drink Soma to make thee glad.  
The share which they have fixed for thee, thou, Indra, Victor o’er all
hosts and space, begirt with Maruts, Lord of Heroes, winner of the
floods.  
2 Maghavan, help thy worshipper: let him help thee. O Śatakratu, drink
Soma to make thee glad.  
The share which they have fixed for thee, etc.  
3 Thou aidest Gods with food, and that with might aids thee,  
O Śatakratu, drink Soma to make thee glad.  
4 Creator of the heaven, creator of the earth, O Śatakratu, drink Soma
to make thee glad.  
5 Father of cattle, father of all steeds art thou. O Śatakratu, drink
Soma to make thee glad.  
6 Stone-hurler, glorify the Atris' hymn of praise. O Śatakratu, drink
Soma to make thee glad.  
7 Hear thou Śyāvāśva while he pours to thee, as erst thou heardest Atri
when he wrought his holy rites.  
Indra, thou only gavest Trasadasyu aid in the fierce fight with heroes,
strengthening his prayers.
