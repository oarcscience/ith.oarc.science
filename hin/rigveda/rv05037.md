### HYMN XXXVII. Indra.

1\. BEDEWED with holy oil and meetly worshipped, the Swift One vies with
Sūrya's beam in splendour.  
For him may mornings dawn without cessation who saith, Let us press Soma
out for Indra.  
2 With kindled fire and strewn grass let him worship, and, Soma-presser,
sing with stones adjusted:  
And let the priest whose press-stones ring forth loudly, go down with
his oblation to the river.  
3 This wife is coming near who loves her husband who carries to his home
a vigorous consort.  
Here may his car seek fame, here loudly thunder, and his wheel make a
thousand revolutions.  
4 No troubles vex that King in whose home Indra drinks the sharp Soma
juice with milk commingled.  
With heroes he drives near, he slays the foeman: Blest, cherishing that
name, he guards his people.  
5 May he support in peace and win in battle: he masters both the hosts
that meet together.  
Dear shall he be to Sūrya, dear to Agni, who with pressed Soma offers
gifts to India.
