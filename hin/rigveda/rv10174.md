### HYMN CLXXIV. The King.

1\. WITH offering for success in fight whence Indra was victorious.  
With this, O Brahmaṇaspati, let us attain to royal sway.  
2 Subduing those who rival us, subduing all malignities,  
Withstand the man who menaces, withstand the man who angers us.  
3 Soma and Savitar the God have made thee a victorious King  
All elements have aided thee, to make thee general conqueror.  
4 Oblation, that which Indra. gave and thus grew glorious and most
high,—  
This have I offered, Gods! and hence now, verily, am rivalless.  
5 Slayer of rivals, rivalless, victorious, with royal sway,  
Over these beings may I rule, may I be Sovran of the folk.
