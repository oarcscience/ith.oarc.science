### HYMN XXVI. Indra.

1\. SOMA unpressed ne’er gladdened liberal Indra, no juices pressed
without a prayer have pleased him.  
I generate a laud that shall delight him, new and heroic, so that he may
hear us.  
2 At every laud the Soma gladdens Indra: pressed juices please him as
each psalm is chanted,  
What time the priests with one united effort call him to aid, as sons
invoke their father.  
3 These deeds he did; let him achieve new exploits, such as the priests
declare at their libations.  
Indra hath taken and possessed all castles, like as one common husband
doth his spouses.  
4 Even thus have they declared him. Famed is Indra as Conqueror, sole
distributer of treasures;  
Whose many succours come in close succession. May dear delightful
benefits attend us.  
5 Thus, to bring help to men, Vasiṣṭha laudeth Indra, the peoples' Hero,
at libation.  
Bestow upon us strength and wealth in thousands. Preserve us evermore,
ye Gods, with blessings.
