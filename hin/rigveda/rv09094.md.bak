### HYMN XCIV. Soma Pavamana.

1\. WHEN beauties strive for him as for a charger, then strive the songs
like soldiers for the sunlight.  
Acting the Sage, he flows enrobed in waters and song as ’twere a stall
that kine may prosper.  
2 The worlds expand to hirn who from aforetime found light to spread the
law of life eternal.  
The swelling songs, like kine within the stable, in deep devotion call
aloud on Indu.  
3 When the sage bears his holy wisdom round him, like a car visiting all
worlds, the Hero,  
Becoming fame, mid Gods, unto the mortal, wealth to the skilled, worth
praise mid the Ever-present,  
4 For glory born be hath come forth to glory: he giveth life and glory
to the singers.  
They, clothed in glory, have become immortal. He, measured in his
course, makes frays successful.  
5 Stream to us food and vigour, kine and horses: give us broad lights
and fill thGods with rapture.  
All ther are easy things for thee to master thou, Pavamana Soma,
quellest foemen.
