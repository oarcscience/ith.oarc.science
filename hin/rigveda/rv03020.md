### HYMN XX Agni.

1\. WITH lauds at break of morn the priest invoketh Agni, Dawn,
Dadhikrās, and both the Aśvins.  
With one consent the Gods whose light is splendid, longing to taste our
sacrifice, shall hear us.  
2 Three are thy powers, O Agni, three thy stations, three are thy
tongues, yea, many, Child of Order!  
Three bodies hast thou which the Gods delight in: with these protect our
hymns with care unceasing.  
3 O Agni, many are the names thou bearest, immortal, God, Divine, and
Jātavedas.  
And many charms of charmers, All-Inspirer! have they laid in thee, Lord
of true attendants!  
4 Agni, like Bhaga, leads the godly people, he who is true to Law and
guards the seasons.  
Ancient, all-knowing, he the Vṛtra-slayer shall bear the singer safe
through every trouble.  
5 I call on Savitar the God, on Morning, Bṛhaspati, and Dadhikrās, and
Agni,  
On Varuṇa and Mitra, on the Aśvins, Bhaga, the Vasus, Rudras and
Ādityas.
