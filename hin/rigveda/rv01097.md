### HYMN XCVII. Agni.

1\. CHASING with light our sin away, O Agni, shine thou wealth on us.  
May his light chase our sin away.  
2 For goodly fields, for pleasant homes, for wealth we sacrifice to
thee.  
May his light chase our sin away.  
3 Best praiser of all these be he; foremost, our chiefs who sacrifice.  
May his light chase our sin away.  
4 So that thy worshippers and we, thine, Agni, in our sons may live.  
May his light chase our sin away.  
5 As ever-conquering Agni's beams of splendour go to every side,  
May his light chase our sin away.  
6 To every side thy face is turned, thou art triumphant everywhere.  
May his light chase our sin away.  
7 O thou whose face looks every way, bear us past foes as in a ship.  
May his light chase our sin away.  
8 As in a ship, convey thou us for our advantage o’er the flood.  
May his light chase our sin away.
