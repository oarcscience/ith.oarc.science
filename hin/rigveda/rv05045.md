### HYMN XLV. Viśvedevas.

1\. BARDS of approaching Dawn who know the heavens are come with hymns
to throw the mountain open.  
The Sun hath risen and oped the stable portals: the doors of men, too,
hath the God thrown open.  
2 Sūrya hath spread his light as splendour: hither came the Cows'
Mother, conscious, from the stable,  
To streams that flow with biting waves to deserts; and heaven is
stablished like a firm-set pillar.  
3 This laud hath won the burden of the mountain. To aid the ancient
birth of mighty waters  
The mountain parted, Heaven performed his office. The worshippers were
worn with constant serving.  
4 With hymns and God-loved words will I invoke you, Indra and Agni, to
obtain your favour,  
For verily sages, skilled in sacrificing, worship the Maruts and with
lauds invite them.  
5 This day approach us: may our thoughts be holy, far from us let us
cast away misfortune.  
Let us keep those who hate us at a distance, and haste to meet the man
who sacrifices.  
6 Come, let us carry out, O friends, the purpose wherewith the Mother
threw the Cow's stall open,  
That wherewith Manu conquered Visisipra, wherewith the wandering
merchant gained heaven's water.  
7 Here, urged by hands, loudly hath rung the press-stone wherewith
Navagvas through ten months sang praises.  
Saramā went aright and found the cattle. Aṅgiras gave effect to all
their labours.  
8 When at the dawning of this mighty Goddess, Aṅgirases all sang forth
with the cattle,—  
Their spring is in the loftiest place of meeting,—Saramā found the kine
by Order's pathway.  
9 Borne by his Coursers Seven may Sūrya visit the field that spreadeth
wide for his long journey.  
Down on the Soma swooped the rapid Falcon. Bright was the young Sage
moving mid his cattle.  
10 Sūrya hath mounted to the shining ocean when he hath yoked his
fair-backed Tawny Horses.  
The wise have drawn him like a ship through water: the floods obedient
have descended hither.  
11 I lay upon the Floods your hymn, lightwinning, wherewith Navagvas
their ten months completed.  
Through this our hymn may we have Gods to guard us: through this our
hymn pass safe beyond affliction.
