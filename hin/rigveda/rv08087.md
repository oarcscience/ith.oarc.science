### HYMN LXXXVII. Indra.

1\. To Indra sing a Sāma hymn, a lofty song to Lofty Sage,  
To him who guards the Law, inspired, and fain for praise.  
2 Thou, Indra, art the Conqueror: thou gavest splendour to the Sun.  
Maker of all things, thou art Mighty and All-God.  
3 Radiant with light thou wentest to the sky, the luminous realm of
heaven.  
ne Deities, Indra strove to win thee for their Friend.  
4 Come unto us, O Indra, dear, still conquering, unconcealable,  
Vast as a mountain spread on all sides, Lord of Heaven.  
5 O truthful Soma-drinker, thou art mightier than both the worlds.  
Thou strengthenest him who pours libation, Lord of Heaven.  
6 For thou art he, O Indra, wiio stormeth all castles of the foe,  
Slayer of Dasyus, man's Supporter, Lord of Heaven.  
7 Now have we, Indra, Friend of Song, sent our great wishes forth to
thee,  
Coming like floods that follow floods.  
8 As rivers swell the ocean, so, Hero, our prayers increase thy might,  
Though of thyself, O Thunderer, waxing day by day.  
9 With holy song mey bind to the broad wide-yoked car the Bay Steeds of
the rapid God,  
Bearers of Indra, yoked by word.  
10 O Indra, bring great strength to us, bring valour, Śatakratu, thou
most active, bring  
A hero conquering in war.  
11 For, gracious Śatakratu, thou hast ever been a Mother and a Sire to
us,  
So now for bliss we pray to thee.  
12 To thee, Strong, Much-invoked, who showest forth thy strength, O
Śatakratu, do I speak:  
So grant thou us heroic strength.
