### HYMN XXVIII. Agni.

1\. AGNI inflamed hath sent to heaven his lustre: he shines forth widely
turning unto Morning.  
Eastward the ladle goes that brings all blessing, praising the Godswith
homage and oblation.  
2 Enkindled, thou art King of the immortal world: him who brings
offerings thou attendest for his weal.  
He whom thou urgest on makes all possessions his: he sets before thee,
Agni, gifts that guests may claim.  
3 Show thyself strong for mighty bliss, O Agni, most excellent be thine
effulgent splendours.  
Make easy to maintain our household lordship, and overcome the might of
those who hate us.  
4 Thy glory, Agni, I adore, kindled, exalted in thy strength.  
A Steer of brilliant splendour, thou art lighted well at sacred rites.  
5 Agni, invoked and kindled, serve the Gods, thou skilled in
sacrifice:  
For thou art bearer of our gifts.  
6 Invoke and worship Agni while the sacrificial rite proceeds:  
For offering-bearer choose ye him.
