### HYMN LXIII. Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. COMMON to all mankind, auspicious Sūrya, he who beholdeth all, is
mounting upward;  
The God, the eye of Varuṇa and Mitra, who rolled up darkness like a
piece of leather.  
2 Sūrya's great ensign, restless as the billow, that urgeth men to
action, is advancing:  
Onward he still would roll the wheel well-rounded, which Etaśa,
harnessed to the car-pole, moveth.  
3 Refulgent from the bosom of the Mornings, he in Whom singers take
delight ascendeth.  
This Savitar, God, is my chief joy and pleasure, who breaketh not the
universal statute.  
4 Golden, far-seeing, from the heaven he riseth: far is his goal, he
hasteth on resplendent.  
Men, verily, inspirited by Sūrya speed to their aims and do the work
assigned them.  
5 Where the irrunortals have prepared his pathway he flieth through the
region like a falcon.  
With homage and oblations will we serve you, O Mitra-Varuṇa, when the
Sun hath risen.  
6 Now Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman vouchsafe us freedom and room, for us and
for our children.  
May we find paths all fair and good to travel. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
