### HYMN CLV. Various.

1\. ARAYI, one-eyed limping hag, fly, ever-screeching, to the hill.  
We frighten thee away with these, the heroes of Sirimbitha.  
2 Scared from this place and that is she, destroyer of each germ
unborn.  
Go, sharp-horned Brāhmaṇaspti and drive Arayi far away.  
3 Yon log that floats without a man to guide it on the river's edge,—  
Seize it, thou thing with hideous jaws, and go thou far away thereon.  
4 When, foul with secret stain and spot, ye hastened onward to the
breast,  
All Indra's enemies were slain and passed away like froth and foam.  
5 These men have led about the cow, have duly carried Agni round,  
And raised their glory tg the Gods. Who will attack them with success?
