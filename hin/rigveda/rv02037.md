### HYMN XXXVII. Various Gods.

1\. Enjoy thy fill of meath out of the Hotar's cup: Adhvaryus he desires
a full draught poured for him.  
Bring it him: seeking this he gives. Granter of Wealth, drink Soma with
the Ṛtus from the Hotar's cup.  
2 He whom of old I called on, him I call on now. He is to be invoked;
his name is He who Gives,  
Here brought by priests is Soma meath. Granter of Wealth, drink Soma
with the Ṛtus from the Potar's cup.  
3 Fat may the horses be wherewith thou speedest on: Lord of the Wood,
unharming, strengthen thou thyself.  
Drawing and seizing, Bold One, thou who grantest wealth, drink Soma with
the Ṛtus from the Neṣṭar's cup.  
4 From Hotar's cup and Potar's he hath drunk and joyed: the proffered
food hath pleased him from the Neṣṭar's bowl.  
The fourth cup undisturbed, immortal, let him drink who giveth wealth,
the cup of the wealth-giving God.  
5 Yoke, O ye Twain, to-day your hero-bearing car, swift-moving
hitherward: your loosing-place is here.  
Mix the oblations, then come hither with the meath, and drink the Soma,
ye rich in abundant strength.  
6 Agni, accept the fuel and our offered gift: accept the prayer of man,
accept our eulogy,  
Do thou with all, with Ṛtu, O thou Excellent, fain, make the great Gods
all fain taste the gift we bring.
