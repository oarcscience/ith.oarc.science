### HYMN CLXXXII. Aśvins.

1\. THIS was the task. Appear promptly, ye prudent Ones. Here is the
chariot drawn by strong steeds: be ye glad.  
Heart-stirring, longed for, succourers of Viśpalā, here are Heaven's
Sons whose sway blesses the pious man.  
2 Longed for, most Indra-like, mighty, most Marut-like, most wonderful
in deed, car-borne, best charioteers,  
Bring your full chariot hither heaped with liquid sweet: thereon, ye
Aśvins, come to him who offers gifts.  
3 What make ye there, ye Mighty? Wherefore linger ye with folk who,
offering not, are held in high esteem?  
Pass over them; make ye the niggard's life decay: give light unto the
singer eloquent in praise.  
4 Crunch up on. every side the dogs who bark at us: slay ye our foes, O
Aśvins this ye understand.  
Make wealthy every word of him who praises you: accept with favour, both
Nāsatyas, this my laud.  
5 Ye made for Tugra's son amid the water-floods that animated ship with
wings to fly withal,  
Whereon with God-devoted mind ye brought him forth, and fled with easy
flight from out the mighty surge.  
6 Four ships most welcome in the midst of ocean, urged by the Aśvins,
save the son of Tugra,  
Him who was cast down headlong in the waters, plunged in the thick
inevitable darkness.  
7 What tree was that which stood fixed in surrounding sea to which the
son of Tugra supplicating clung?  
Like twigs, of which some winged creature may take hold, ye, Aśvins,
bore him off safely to your renown.  
8 Welcome to you be this the hymn of praises uttered by Mānas, O
Nāsatyas, Heroes,  
From this our gathering where we offer Soma. May we find strengthening
food in full abundance.
