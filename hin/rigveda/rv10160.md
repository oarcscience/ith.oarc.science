### HYMN CLX. Indra.

1\. TASTE this strong draught enriched with offered viands: with all thy
chariot here unyoke thy Coursers.  
Let not those other sacrificers stay thee, Indra: these juices shed for
thee are ready.  
2 Thine is the juice effused, thine are the juices yet to be pressed:
our resonant songs invite thee.  
O Indra, pleased to-day with this libation, come, thou who knowest all
and drink the Soma.  
3 Whoso, devoted to the God, effuses Soma for him with yearning heart
and spirit,—  
Never doth Indra give away his cattle: for him he makes the lovely Soma
famous.  
4 He looks with Ioving favour on the mortal who, like a rich man, pours
for him the Soma.  
Maghavan in his bended arm supports him: he slays, unasked, the men who
hate devotion.  
5 We call on thee to come to us, desirous of goods and spoil, of cattle,
and of horses.  
For thy new love and favour are we present: let us invoke thee, Indra,
as our welfare.
