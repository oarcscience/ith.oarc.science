### HYMN XXXV. Indra.

1\. WHEN shall our prayers rest in thy car beside thee? When dost thou
give the singer food for thousands?  
When wilt thou clothe this poet's laud with plenty, and when wilt thou
enrich our hymns with booty?  
2 When wilt thou gatber men with men, O Indra, heroes with heroes, and
prevail in combat?  
Thou shalt win triply kine in frays for cattle, so, Indra, give thou us
celestial glory.  
3 Yea, when wilt thou, O Indra, thou Most Mighty, make the prayer
all-sustaining for the singer?  
When wilt thou yoke, as we yoke songs, thy Horses, and come to offerings
that bring wealth in cattle?  
4 Grant to the Singer food with store of cattle, splendid with horses
and the fame of riches.  
Send food to swell the milch-cow good at milking: bright be its shine
among the Bharadvājas.  
5 Lead otherwise this present foeman, Śakra! Hence art thou praised as
Hero, foe destroyer  
Him who gives pure gifts may I praise unceasing. Sage, quicken the
Aṅgirases by devotion.
