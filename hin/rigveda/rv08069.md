### HYMN LXIX. Indra

1\. O Sarakratu! truely I have made none else my Comforter.  
Indra; be gracious unto us.  
2 Thou who hast ever aided us kindly of old to win the spoil,  
As such, O Indra, favour us.  
3 What now? As prompter of the poor thou helpest him who sheds the
juice.  
Wilt thou not, Indra, strengthen us?  
4 O Indra, help our chariot on, yea, Thunderer, though it lag behind:  
Give this my car the foremost place.  
5 Ho there! why sittest thou at case? Make thou my chariot to be first  
And bring the fame of victory near.  
6 Assist our car that seeks the prize. What can be easier for thee?  
So make thou us victorious.  
7 Indra, be firm: a fort art thou. To thine appointed place proceeds  
The auspicious hymn in season due.  
8 Let not our portion be disgrace. Broad is the course, the prize is
set,  
The barriers are opened wide.  
9 This thing we wish. that thou mayst take thy fourth, thy sacrificial
name.  
So art thou held to be our Lord.  
10 Ekadyu hath exalted you, Immortals: both Goddesses and Gods hath he
delighted.  
Bestow upon him bounty meet for praises. May he, enriched with prayer,
come soon and early.
