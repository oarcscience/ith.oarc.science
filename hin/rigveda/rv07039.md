### HYMN XXXIX Viśvedevas.

1\. AGNI, erect, hath shown enriching favour: the flame goes forward to
the Gods’ assembly.  
Like car-borne men the stones their path have chosen: let the priest,
quickened, celebrate our worship.  
2 Soft to the tread, their sacred grass is scattered: these go like
Kings amid the band around them,  
At the folks early call on Night and Morning,—Vāyu, and Pūṣan with his
team, to bless us.  
3 Here on their path the noble Gods proceeded: in the wide firmament the
Beauteous decked them.  
Bend your way hither, ye who travel widely: hear this our envoy who hath
gone to meet you.  
4 For they are holy aids at sacrifices: all Gods approach the place of
congregation.  
Bring these, desirous, to our worship, Agni, swift the Nisatyas, Bhaga,
and Purandhi.  
5 Agni, to these men's hymns, from earth, from heaven, bring Mitra,
Varuṇa, Indra, and Agni,  
And Aryaman, and Aditi, and Viṣṇu. Sarasvatī be joyful, and the
Maruts.  
6 Even as the holy wish, the gift is offered: may he, unsated, come when
men desire him.  
Give never-failing ever-conquering riches: with Gods for our allies may
we be victors.  
7 Now have both worlds been praised by the Vasisthas; and holy Mitra,
Varuṇa, and Agni.  
May they, bright Deities, make our song supremest. Preserve us evermore,
ye Gods, with blessings.
