### HYMN LXII. Viśvedevas, Etc.

1\. YE, who, adorned with guerdon through the sacrifice, have won you
Indra's friendship and eternal life,  
Even to you be happiness, Aṅgirases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye who are
most wise.  
2 The Fathers, who drave forth the wealth in cattle, have in the year's
courses cleft Vala by Eternal Law:  
A lengthened life be yours, O ye Aṅgirases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye
who are most wise.  
3 Ye raised the Sun to heaven by everlasting Law, and spread broad
earth, the Mother, out on every side.  
Fair wealth of progeny be yours, Aṅgirases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye
who are most wise.  
4 This kinsman in your dwellingplace speaks pleasant words: give car to
this, ye Ṛṣis, children of the Gods.  
High Brahman dignity be yours, Aṅgirases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye
who are most wise.  
5 Distinguished by their varied form, these Ṛṣis have been deeply
moved.  
These are the sons of Aṅgirases: from Agni have they sprung to life.  
6 Distinguished by their varied form, they sprang from Agni, from the
sky.  
Navagva and Daśagva, noblest Aṅgiras, he giveth bounty with the Gods.  
7 With Indra for associate the priests have cleared the stable full of
steeds and kine,  
Giving to me a thousand with their eightmarked cars, they gained renown
among the Gods.  
8 May this man's sons be multiplied; like springing corn may Manu
grow,  
Who gives at once in bounteous gift a thousand kine, a hundred steeds.  
9 No one attains to him, as though a man would grasp the heights of
heaven.  
Savarnya's sacrificial meed hath broadened like an ample flood.  
10 Yadu and Turva, too, have given two Dāsas, well-disposed, to serve,  
Together with great store of kine.  
11 Blest be the hamlet's chief, most liberal Manu, and may his bounty
rival that of Sūrya.  
May the God let Ssvarni's life be leng  
thened, with whom, unwearied, we have lived and prospered.
