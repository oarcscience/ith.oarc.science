### HYMN XLII Kapiñjala.

1\. TELLING his race aloud with cries repeated, he sends his voice out
as his boat a steersman.  
O Bird, be ominous of happy fortune from no side may calamity befall
thee.  
2 Let not the falcon kill thee, nor the eagle let not the arrow-bearing
archer reach thee.  
Still crying in the region of the Fathers, speak here auspicious,
bearing joyful tidings.  
3 Bringing good tidings, Bird of happy omen, call thou out loudly
southward of our dwellings,  
So that no thief, no sinner may oppress us. Loud may we speak, with
heroes, in assembly.
