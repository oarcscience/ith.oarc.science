Heritage

### HYMN CLXXVI. Indra.

1\. CHEER thee with draughts to win us bliss: Soma, pierce Indra in thy
strength.  
Thou stormest trembling in thy rage, and findest not a foeman nigh.  
2 Make our songs penetrate to him who is the Only One of men;  
For whom the sacred food is spread, as the steer ploughs the barley
in.  
3 Within whose hands deposited all the Five Peoples’ treasures rest.  
Mark thou the man who injures us and kill him like the heavenly bolt.  
4 Slay everyone who pours no gift, who, hard to reach, delights thee
not.  
Bestow on us what wealth he hath: this even the worshipper awaits.  
5 Thou helpest him the doubly strong whose hymns were sung
unceasingly.  
When Indra fought, O Soma, thou helpest the mighty in the fray.  
6 As thou, O Indra, to the ancient singers wast ever joy, like water to
the thirsty,  
So unto thee I sing this invocation. May we find strengthening food in
full abundance.
