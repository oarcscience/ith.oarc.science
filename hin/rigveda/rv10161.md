### HYMN CLXI. Indra.

1\. FOR life I set thee free by this oblation from the unknown decline
and from Consumption;  
Or, if the grasping demon have possessed him, free him from her, O
Indra, thou and Agni.  
2 Be his days ended, be he now departed, be he brought very near to
death already,  
Out of Destruction's lap again I bring him, save him for life to last a
hundred autumns.  
3 With hundred-eyed oblation, hundred-autumned, bringing a hundred
lives, have I restored him,  
That Indra for a hundred years may lead him safe to the farther shore of
all misfortune.  
4 Live, waxing in thy strength, a hundred autumns, live through a
hundred springs, a hundred winters.  
Through hundred-lived oblation Indra, Agni, Bṛhaspati, Savitar yield him
for a hundred!  
5 So have I found and rescued thee thou hast returned with youth
renewed.  
Whole in thy members! I have found thy sight and all thy life for thee.
