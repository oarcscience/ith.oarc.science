### HYMN XXXII. Indra.

1 I WILL declare the manly deeds of Indra, the first that he achieved,
the Thunder-wielder.  
He slew the Dragon, then disclosed the waters, and cleft the channels of
the mountain torrents.  
2 He slew the Dragon lying on the mountain: his heavenly bolt of thunder
Tvaṣṭar fashioned.  
Like lowing kine in rapid flow descending the waters glided downward to
the ocean.  
3 Impetuous as a bull, he chose the Soma and in three sacred beakers
drank the juices.  
Maghavan grasped the thunder for his weapon, and smote to death this
firstborn of the dragons.  
4 When, Indra, thou hadst slain the dragon's firstborn, and overcome the
charms of the enchanters,  
Then, giving life to Sun and Dawn and Heaven, thou foundest not one foe
to stand against thee.  
5 Indra with his own great and deadly thunder smote into pieces Vṛtra,
worst of Vṛtras.  
As trunks of trees, what time the axe hath felled them, low on the earth
so lies the prostrate Dragon.  
6 He, like a mad weak warrior, challenged Indra, the great impetuous
many-slaying Hero.  
He, brooking not the clashing of the weapons, crushed—Indra's foe—the
shattered forts in falling.  
7 Footless and handless still he challenged Indra, who smote him with
his bolt between the shoulders.  
Emasculate yet claiming manly vigour, thus Vṛtra lay with scattered
limbs dissevered.  
8 There as he lies like a bank-bursting river, the waters taking courage
flow above him.  
The Dragon lies beneath the feet of torrents which Vṛtra with his
greatness had encompassed.  
9 Then humbled was the strength of Vṛtra's mother: Indra hath cast his
deadly bolt against her.  
The mother was above, the son was under and like a cow beside her calf
lay Danu.  
10 Rolled in the midst of never-ceasing currents flowing without a rest
for ever onward.  
The waters bear off Vṛtra's nameless body: the foe of Indra sank to
during darkness.  
11 Guarded by Ahi stood the thralls of Dāsas, the waters stayed like
kine held by the robber.  
But he, when he had smitten Vṛtra, opened the cave wherein the floods
had been imprisoned.  
12 A horse's tail wast thou when he, O Indra, smote on thy bolt; thou,
God without a second,  
Thou hast won back the kine, hast won the Soma; thou hast let loose to
flow the Seven Rivers.  
13 Nothing availed him lightning, nothing thunder, hailstorm or mist
which had spread around him:  
When Indra and the Dragon strove in battle, Maghavan gained the victory
for ever.  
14 Whom sawest thou to avenge the Dragon, Indra, that fear possessed thy
heart when thou hadst slain him;  
That, like a hawk affrighted through the regions, thou crossedst
nine-and-ninety flowing rivers?  
15 Indra is King of all that moves and moves not, of creatures tame and
horned, the Thunder-wielder.  
Over all living men he rules as Sovran, containing all as spokes within
the felly.
