### HYMN XVI. Indra.

1 LET thy Bay Steeds bring thee, the Strong, hither to drink the Soma
draught—  
Those, Indra, who are bright as suns.  
2 Here are the grains bedewed with oil: hither let the Bay Coursers
bring  
Indra upon his easiest car.  
3 Indra at early morn we call, Indra in course of sacrifice,  
Indra to drink the Soma juice.  
4 Come hither, with thy long-maned Steeds, O Indra, to he draught we
pour  
We call thee when the juice is shed.  
5 Come thou to this our song of praise, to the libation poured for
thee  
Drink of it like a stag athirst.  
6 Here are the drops of Soma juice expressed on sacred grass: thereof  
Drink, Indra, to increase thy might.  
7 Welcome to thee be this our hymn, reaching thy heart, most
excellent:  
Then drink the Soma juice expressed.  
8 To every draught of pressed-out juice Indra, the Vṛtra-slayer,
comes,  
To drink the Soma for delight.  
9 Fulfil, O Śatakratu, all our wish with horses and with kine:  
With holy thoughts we sing thy praise.
