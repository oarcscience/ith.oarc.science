### HYMN XXXV. Viśvedevas.

1\. THESE fires associate with Indra are awake, bringing their light
when first the Dawn begins to shine.  
May Heaven and Earth, great Pair, observe our holy work. We claim for us
this day the favour of the Gods.  
2 Yea, for ourselves we claim the grace of Heaven and Earth, of
Śaryaṇāvān, of the Hills and Mother Streams.  
For innocence we pray to Sūrya and to Dawn. So may the flowing Soma
bring us bliss to-day.  
3 May the great Twain, the Mothers, Heaven and Earth, this day preserve
us free from sin for peace and happiness.  
May Morning sending forth her light drive sin afar. We pray to kindled
Agni for felicity.  
4 May this first Dawn bring us the host of gracious Gods: rich, may it
richly shine for us who strive for wealth.  
The wrath of the malignant may we keep afar. We pray to kindled Agni for
feilicity.  
5 Dawns, who come forward with the bright beams of the Sun, and at your
earliest flushing bring to us the light,  
Shine ye on us to-day auspicious, for renown. We pray to kindled Agni
for felicity.  
6 Free from all sickness may the Mornings come to us, and let our fires
mount upward with a lofty blaze.  
The Aśvin Pair have harnessed their swift-moving car. We pray to kindled
Agni for felicity.  
7 Send us to-day a portion choice and excellent, O Savitar, for thou art
he who dealeth wealth.  
I cry to Dhiṣaṇā, Mother of opulence. We pray to kindled Agni for
felicity.  
8 Further me this declaring of Eternal Law, the Law of Gods, as we
mortals acknowledge it!  
The Sun goes up beholding all the rays of morn. We pray to kindled Agni
for felicity.  
9 This day we pray with innocence in strewing grass, adjusting
pressing-stones, and perfecting the hymn.  
Thou in the Ādityas’ keeping movest restlessly. We pray to kindled Agni
for felicity.  
10 To our great holy grass I bid the Gods at morn to banquet, and will
seat them as the seven priests,—  
Varuṇa, Indra, Mitra, Bhaga for our gain. We pray to kindled Agni for
felicity.  
11 Come hither, O Ādityas, for our perfect weal: accordant help our
sacrifice that we may thrive.  
Pūṣan, Bṛhaspati, Bhaga, both Aśvins, and enkindled Agni we implore for
happiness.  
12 Ādityas, Gods, vouchsafe that this our home may be praise-worthy,
prosperous, our heroes' sure defence,  
For cattle, for our sons, for progeny, for life. We pray to kindled Agni
for felicity.  
13 This day may all the Maruts, all he near us with aid: may all our
fires be well enkindled.  
May all Gods come to us with gracious favour. May spoil and wealth he
ours, and all possessions.  
14 He whom ye aid, O Deities, in battle, whom ye protect and rescue from
affliction,  
Who fears no danger at your milk-libation, -such may we be to feast the
Gods, ye Mighty.
