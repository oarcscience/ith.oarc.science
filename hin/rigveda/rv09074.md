### HYMN LXXIV. Soma Pavamana

1\. BORN like a youngling he hath clamoured in the wood, when he, the
Red, the Strong, would win the light of heaven.  
He comes with heavenly seed that makes the water swell: him for
wide-spreading shelter we implore with prayer.  
2 A far-extended pillar that supports the sky the Soma-stalk, filled
full, moves itself every way.  
He shall bring both these great worlds while the rite proceeds: the Sage
holds these who move! together and all food.  
3 Wide space hath he who follows Aditi's right path, and mighty,
well-made food, meath blent with Soma juice;  
He who from hence commands the rain, Steer of the kine, Leader of
floods, who helps us hence, who claims our laud.  
4 Butter and milk are drawn from animated cloud; thence Amṛta is
produced, centre of sacrifice.  
Hini the Most Bounteous Ones, ever united, love; him as ouir Friend the
Men who make all swell rain down.  
5 The Soma-stalk hath roared, following with the wave: he swells with
sap for man the skin which Gods enjoy.  
Upon the lap of Aditi he lays the germ, by means whereof we gain
children and progeny.  
6 In the third region which distils a thousand streams, may the
Exhaustless Ones descend with procreant power.  
The kindred Four have been sent downward from the heavens: dropping with
oil they bring Amṛta and sacred gifts.  
7 Soma assumes white colour when he strives to gain: the bounteous Asura
knows full many a precious boon.  
Down the steep slope, through song, he comes to sacrifice, and he will
burst the water-holding cask of heaven,  
8 Yea, to the shining milk-anointed beaker, as to his goal, hath stepped
the conquering Courser.  
Pious-souled men have sent their giffi of cattle unto Kakṣīvān of the
hundred winters.  
9 Soma, thy juice when thou art blended with the streams, flows,
Pavamana, through the long wool of the sheep.  
So, cleansed by sages. O best giver of delight, grow sweet for Indra,
Pavamana! for his drink.
