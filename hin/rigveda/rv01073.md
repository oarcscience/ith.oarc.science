### HYMN LXXIII. Agni.

1\. HE who gives food, like patrimonial riches and guides aright like
some wise man's instruction,  
Loved like a guest who lies in pleasant lodging,—may he, as Priest,
prosper his servant's dwelling.  
2 He who like Savitar the God, true-minded protecteth with his power.
all acts of vigour,  
Truthful, like splendour, glorified by many, like breath joy-giving,—all
must strive to win him.  
3 He who on earth dwells like a king surrounded by faithful friends,
like a God all-sustaining,  
Like heroes who preside, who sit in safety: like as a blameless dame
dear to her husband.  
4 Thee, such, in settlements secure, O Agni, our men serve ever kindled
in each dwelling.  
On him have they laid splendour in abundance: dear to all men, bearer be
he of riches.  
5 May thy rich worshippers win food, O Agni, and princes gain long life
who bring oblation.  
May we get booty from our foe in battle, presenting to the Gods their
share for glory.  
6 The cows of holy law, sent us by Heaven, have swelled with laden
udders, loudly lowing;  
Soliciting his favour, from a distance the rivers to the rock have
flowed together.  
7 Agni, with thee, soliciting thy favour, the holy Ones have gained
glory in heaven.  
They made the Night and Dawn of different colours, and set the black and
purple hues together.  
8 May we and those who worship be the mortals whom thou, O Agni, leadest
on to riches.  
Thou hast filled earth and heaven and air's mid-region, and followest
the whole world like a shadow.  
9 Aided by thee, O Agni, may we conquer steeds with steeds, men with
men, heroes with heroes,  
Lords of the wealth transmitted by our fathers: and may our princes live
a hundred winters.  
10 May these our hymns of praise, Agni, Ordainer, be pleasant to thee in
thy heart and spirit.  
May we have power to hold thy steeds of riches, laying on thee the
God-sent gift of glory.
