### HYMN XXXVII. Ṛbhus.

1\. COME to our sacrifice, Vājas, Ṛbhukṣans, Gods, by the paths which
Gods are wont to travel,  
As ye, gay Gods, accept in splendid weather the sacrifice among these
folk of Manus.  
2 May these rites please you in your heart and spirit; may the drops
clothed in oil this day approach you.  
May the abundant juices bear you onward to power and strength, and, when
imbibed, delight you.  
3 Your threefold going near is God-appointed, so praise is given you,
Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans.  
So, Manus-like, mid younger folk I offer, to you who are aloft in
heaven, the Soma.  
4 Strong, with fair chains of gold and jaws of iron, ye have a splendid
car and well-fed horses.  
Ye Sons of Strength, ye progeny of Indra, to you the best is offered to
delight you.  
5 Ṛbhukṣans! him, for handy wealth, the mightiest comrade in the
fight,  
Him, Indra's equal, we invoke, most bounteous ever, rich in steeds.  
6 The mortal man whom, Ṛbhus, ye and Indra favour with your help,  
Must be successful, by his thoughts, at sacrifice and with the steed.  
7 O Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans, free for us the paths to sacrifice,  
Ye Princes, lauded, that we may press forward to each point of heaven.  
8 O Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans, ye Nāsatyas, Indra, bless this wealth,  
And, before other men's, the steed, that ample riches may be won.
