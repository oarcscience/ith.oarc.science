### HYMN LXXXI. Savitar.

1\. THE priests of him the lofty Priest well-skilled in hymns harness
their spirit, yea, harness their holy thoughts.  
He only knowing works assigns their priestly tasks. Yea, lofty is the
praise of Savitar the God.  
2 The Sapient One arrays himself in every form: for quadruped and biped
he hath brought forth good.  
Excellent Savitar hath looked on heaven's high vault, and shineth after
the outgoing of the Dawn.  
3 Even he, the God whose going-forth and majesty the other Deities have
followed with their might,  
He who hath measured the terrestrial regions out by his great power, he
is the Courser Savitar.  
4 To the three spheres of light thou goest, Savitar, and with the rays
of Sidrya thou combinest thee.  
Around, on both sides thou encompassest the night: yea, thou, O God, art
Mitra through thy righteous laws.  
5 Over all generation thou art Lord alone: Pūṣan art thou, O God, in all
thy goings-forth.  
Yea, thou hast domination over all this world. Śyāvāśva hath brought
praise to thee, O Savitar,
