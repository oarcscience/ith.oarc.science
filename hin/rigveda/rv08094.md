### HYMN II. Indra.

1\. SAKRA I praise, to win his aid, far-famed, exceeding bountiful,  
Who gives, as ’twere in thousands, precious wealth to him who sheds the
juice and worships him.  
2 Arrows with hundred points, unconquerable, are this Indra's n-dghty
arms in war.  
He streams on liberal worshippers like a hill with springs, when juices
poured have gladdened him.  
3 What time the flowing Soma-drops have gladdened with their taste the
Friend,  
Like water, gracious Lord! were my libations made, like milch-kine to
the worshipper.  
4 To him the peerless, who is calling you to give you aid, forth flow
the drops of pleasant meath.  
The Soloa-drops which call on thee, O gracious Lord, have brought thee
to our hymn of praise.  
5 He rushes hurrying like a steed to Soma that adorns our rite,  
Which hymns make sweet to thee, lover of pleasant food. The call to
Paura thou dost love.  
6 Praise the strong, grasping Hero, winner of the spoil, ruling supreme
oer mighty wealth.  
Like a full spring, O Thunderer, from thy store hast thou poured on the
worshipper evermore.  
7 Now whether thou be far away, or in the heavens, or on the earth,  
O Indra, mighty- thoughted, harnessing thy Bays, come Lofty with the
Lofty Ones.  
8 The Bays who draw thy chariot, Steeds who injure none, surpass the
wind's impetuous strength-  
With whom thou silencest the enemy of man, with whon; thou goest round
the sky.  
9 O gracious Hero, may we learn anew to know thee as thou art:  
As in decisive fight thou holpest Etaśa, or Vaśa 'gainst Dasavraja,  
10 As, Maghavan, to Kaṇva at the sacred feast, to Dirghanitha thine
home-friend,  
As to Gosarya thou, Stone-darter, gavest wealth, give me a gold-bright
stall of kine.
