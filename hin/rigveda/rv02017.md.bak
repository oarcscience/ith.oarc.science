### HYMN XVII. Indra.

1\. LIKE the Aṅgirases, sing this new song forth to him, for, as in
ancient days, his mighty powers are shown,  
When in the rapture of the Soma he unclosed with strength the solid
firm-shut stables of the kine.  
2 Let him be even that God who, for the earliest draught measuring out
his power, increased his majesty;  
Hero who fortified his body in the wars, and through his greatness set
the heaven upon his head.  
3 Thou didst perform thy first great deed of hero might what time thou
showedst power, through prayer, before this folk.  
Hurled down by thee the car-borne Lord of Tawny Steeds, the congregated
swift ones fled in sundry ways.  
4 He made himself by might Lord of all living things, and strong in
vital power waxed great above them all.  
He, borne on high, o’erspread with light the heaven and earth, and,
sewing up the turbid darkness, closed it in.  
5 He with his might made firm the forward-bending hills, the downward
rushing of the waters he ordained.  
Fast he upheld the earth that nourisheth all life, and stayed the heaven
from falling by his wondrous skill.  
6 Fit for the grasping of his arms is what the Sire hath fabricated from
all kind of precious wealth.  
The thunderbolt, wherewith, loud-roaring, he smote down, and striking
him to death laid Krivi on the earth.  
7 As she who in her parents' house is growing old, I pray to thee as
Bhaga from the seat of all.  
Grant knowledge, mete it out and bring it to us here: give us the share
wherewith thou makest people glad.  
8 May we invoke thee as a liberal giver thou givest us, O Indra,
strength and labours.  
Help us with manifold assistance, Indra: [Mighty](errata.htm#11.md) One,
Indra, make us yet more wealthy.  
9 Now may that wealthy Cow of thine, O Indra, give in return a boon to
him who lauds thee.  
Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Loud may we speak, with
heroes, in assembly.
