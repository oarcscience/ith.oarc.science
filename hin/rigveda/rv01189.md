### HYMN CLXXXIX. Agni.

1\. BY goodly paths lead us to riches, Agni, God who knowest every
sacred duty.  
Remove the sin that makes us stray and wander. most ample adoration will
we bring thee.  
2 Lead us anew to happiness, O Agni; lead us beyond all danger and
affliction.  
Be unto us a wide broad ample castle bless, prosper on their way our
sons and offspring.  
3 Far from us, Agni, put thou all diseases let them strike lauds that
have no saving Agni.  
God, make our home again to be a blessing, with all the Immortal
Deities, O Holy.  
4 Preserve us, Agni, with perpetual succour, refulgent in the dwelling
which thou lovest.  
O Conqueror, most youthful, let no danger touch him who praises thee
to-day or after.  
5 Give not us up a prey to sin, O Agni, the greedy enemy that brings us
trouble;  
Not to the fanged that bites, not to the toothless: give not us up, thou
Conqueror, to the spoiler.  
6 Such as thou art, born after Law, O Agni when lauded give protection
to our bodies,  
From whosoever would reproach or injure: for thou, God, rescuest from
all oppression.  
7 Thou, well discerning both these classes, comest to men at early morn,
O holy Agni.  
Be thou obedient unto man at evening, to be adorned, as keen, by eager
suitors.  
8 To him have we addressed our pious speeches, I, Māna's son, to him
victorious Agni.  
May we gain countless riches with the sages. May we find strengthening
food in full abundance.
