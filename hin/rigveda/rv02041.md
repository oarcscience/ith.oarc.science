### HYMN XLI. Various Deities.

1\. O VĀYU, come to us with all the thousand chariots that are thine,  
Team-borne, to drink the Soma juice.  
2 Drawn by thy team, O Vāyu, come; to thee is offered this, the pure.  
Thou visitest the presser's house.  
3 Indra and Vāyu, drawn by teams, ye Heroes, come today and drink.  
Of the bright juice when blent with milk.  
4 This Soma hath been shed for you, Law-strengtheners, Mitra-Varuṇa!  
Listen ye here to this my call.  
5 Both Kings who never injure aught seat them in their supremest home,  
The thousand-pillared, firmly-based.  
6 Fed with oblation, Sovran Kings, Ādityas, Lords of liberal gifts.  
They wait on him whose life is true.  
7 With kine, Nāsatyas, and with steeds, come, Aśvins, Rudras, to the
house  
That will protect its heroes well;  
8 Such, wealthy Gods! as none afar nor standing nigh to us may harm,  
Yea, no malicious mortal foe.  
9 As such, O longed-far Aśvins, lead us on to wealth of varied sort,  
Wealth that shall bring us room and rest.  
10 Verily Indra, conquering all, driveth e’en mighty fear away,  
For firm is he and swift to act.  
11 Indra be gracious unto us: sin shall not reach us afterward,  
And good shall be before us still.  
12 From all the regions of the world let Indra send security,  
The foe-subduer, swift to act.  
13 O all ye Gods, come hitherward: hear this mine invocation, seat  
Yourselves upon this sacred grass.  
14 Among the Śunahotras strong for you is this sweet gladdening
draught.  
Drink ye of this delightsome juice.  
15 Ye [Maruts](errata.htm#13) led by Indra, Gods with Pūṣan for your
bounteousest,  
Hear all of you this call of mine.  
16 Best Mother, best of Rivers, best of Goddesses, Sarasvatī, We are, as
’twere, of no repute and dear Mother, give thou us renown.  
17 In thee, Sarasvatī, divine, all generations have their stay.  
Be, glad with Śunahotra's sons: O Goddess grant us progeny.  
18 Enriched with sacrifice, accept Sarasvatī, these prayers of ours,  
Thoughts which Gṛtsamadas beloved of Gods bring, Holy One, to thee.  
19 Ye who bless sacrifice, go forth, for verily we choose you both,  
And Agni who conveys our gifts.  
20 This our effectual sacrifice, reaching the sky, shall Heaven and
Earth  
Present unto the Gods to-day.  
21 In both your laps, ye guileless Ones, the Holy Gods shall sit them
down  
To-day to drink the Soma here.
