### HYMN LXXIX. Agni.

1\. HE in mid-air's expanse hath golden tresses; a raging serpent, like
the rushing tempest:  
Purely refulgent, knowing well the morning; like honourable dames, true,
active workers.  
2 Thy well-winged flashes strengthen in their manner, when the black
Bull hath bellowed round about us.  
With drops that bless and seem to smile he cometh: the waters fall, the
clouds utter their thunder.  
3 When he comes streaming with the milk of worship, conducting by
directest paths of Order  
Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa, Parijman fill the hide full where lies the
nether press-stone.  
4 O Agni, thou who art the lord of wealth in kine, thou Son of
Strength,  
Vouchsafe to us, O Jātavedas, high renown.  
5 He, Agni, kindled, good and wise, must be exalted in our song:  
Shine, thou of many forms, shine radiantly on us.  
6 O Agni, shining of thyself by night and when the morning breaks,  
Burn, thou whose teeth are sharp, against the Rākṣasas.  
7 Adorable in all our rites, favour us, Agni, with thine aid,  
When the great hymn is chanted forth.  
8 Bring to us ever-conquering wealth, wealth, Agni, worthy of our
choice,  
In all our frays invincible.  
9 Give us, O Agni, through thy grace wealth that supporteth all our
life,  
Thy favour so that we may live.  
10 O Gotama, desiring bliss present thy songs composed with care  
To Agni of the pointed flames.  
11 May the man fall, O Agni, who near or afar assaileth us:  
Do thou increase and prosper us.  
12 Keen and swift Agni, thousand-eyed, chaseth the Rākṣasas afar:  
He singeth, herald meet for lauds.
