### HYMN LXXXVI. Maruts.

1\. THE best of guardians hath that man within whose dwelling place ye
drink,  
O Maruts, giants of the sky.  
2 Honoured with sacrifice or with the worship of the sages’ hymns,  
O Maruts, listen to the call.  
3 Yea, the strong man to whom ye have vouchsafed to give a sage, shall
move  
Into a stable rich in kine.  
4 Upon this hero's sacred grass Soma is poured in daily rites:  
Praise and delight are sung aloud.  
5 Let the strong Maruts hear him, him surpassing all men: strength be
his  
That reaches even to the Sun.  
6 For, through the swift Gods’ loving help, in many an autumn, Maruts,
we  
Have offered up our sacrifice.  
7 Fortunate shall that mortal be, O Maruts most adorable,  
Whose offerings ye bear away.  
8 O Heroes truly strong, ye know the toil of him who sings your
praise,  
The heart's desire of him who loves.  
9 O ye of true strength, make this thing manifest by your greatness:
strike  
The demon with your thunderbolt.  
10 Conceal the horrid darkness, drive far from us each devouring
fiend.  
Create the light for which we long.
