### HYMN LXI. Viśvedevas.

1\. THE welcome speaker in the storm of battle uttered with might this
prayer to win the Aśvins,  
When the most liberal God, for Paktha, rescued his parents, and assailed
the seven Hotras.  
2 Cyavāna, purposing deceptive presents, with all ingredients, made the
altar ready.  
Most sweet-voiced Tūrvayāṇa poured oblations like floods of widely
fertilizing water.  
3 To his oblations, swift as thought, ye hurried, and welcomed eagerly
the prayers he offered.  
With arrows in his hand the Very Mighty forced from him all obedience of
a servant.  
4 I call on you the Sons of Dyaus, the Aśvins, that a dark cow to my red
kine be added.  
Enjoy my sacrifice, come to my viands contented, not deceiving
expectation. '  
5 Membrum suum virile, quod vrotentum fuerat, mas ille retraxit. Rursus
illud quod in juvenem filiam sublatum fuerat, non aggressurus, ad se
rerahit.  
6 Quum jam in medio connessu, semiperfecto opere, amorem in puellam
pater impleverat, ambo discedentes seminis paulum in terrae superficiem
sacrorum sede effusum emiserunt.  
7 Quum pater suam nilam adiverat, cum eā congressus suum semen supra
[viram](errata.htm#26) effudit. Tum Dii benigni precem (brahma.md)
[progenuerunt](errata.htm#27.md), et Vastoshpatim, legum sacrarum custodem,
formaverunt.  
8 Ille tauro similis spumam in certamine jactavit, tunc discedens
pusillaximis huc profectus est. Quasi dextro pede claudus processit,
"inutiles fuerunt illi mei complexus," ita locutus.  
9 'The fire, burning the people, does not approach quickly (by day): the
naked (*Rākṣasas* approach) not Agni by night; the giver of fuel, and
the giver of food, he, the upholder (of the rite), is born, overcoming
enemies by his might.'  
10 Uttering praise to suit the rite Navagvas came speedily to win the
damsel's friendship.  
They who approached the twice-strong stable's keeper, meedless would
milk the rocks that naught had shaken.  
11 Swift was new friendship with the maid they quickly accepted it as
genuine seed and bounty.  
Milk which the cow Sabardughā had yielded was the bright heritage which
to thee they offered.  
12 When afterwards they woke and missed the cattle, the speaker thus in
joyful mood addressed them:  
Matchless are singers through the Vasu's nature; he bringeth them all
food and all possessions.  
13 His followers then who dwelt in sundry places came and desired too
slay the son of Nṛṣad.  
Resistless foe, be found the hidden treasure of Śuṣṇa multiplied in
numerous offspring.  
14 Thou, called Effulgence, in whose threefold dwelling, as in the light
of heaven, the Gods are sitting,  
Thou who art called Agni or Jātavedas, Priest, hear us, guileless Priest
of holy worship.  
15 And, Indra, bring, that I may laud and serve them, those Two
resplendent glorious Nāsatyas,  
Blithe, bounteous, man-like, to the sacrificer, honoured among our men
with offered viands.  
16 This King is praised and honoured as Ordainer: himself the bridge,
the Sage speeds o’er the waters.  
He hath stirred up Kakṣīvān, stirred up Agni, as the steed's swift wheel
drives the felly onward.  
17 Vaitarana, doubly kinsman, sacrificer, shall milk the cow who ne’er
hath calved, Sabardhu,  
When I encompass Varuṇa and Mitra with lauds, and Aryaman in safest
shelter.  
18 Their kin, the Prince in heaven, thy nearest kinsman, turning his
thought to thee thus speaks in kindness:  
This is our highest bond: I am his offspring. How many others came ere I
succeeded?  
19 Here is my kinship, here the place I dwell in: these are my Gods; I
in full strength am present.  
Twice-born am I, the first-born Son of Order: the Cow milked this when
first she had her being.  
20 So mid these tribes he rests, the friendly envoy, borne on two paths,
refulgent Lord of fuel.  
When, like a line, the Babe springs up erectly, his Mother straight hath
borne him strong to bless us.  
21 Then went the milch-kine forth to please the damsel, and for the good
of every man that liveth.  
Hear us, O wealthy Lord; begin our worship. Thou hast grown mighty
through Āśvaghna's virtues.  
22 And take thou notice of us also, Indra, for ample riches, King whose
arm wields thunder!  
Protect our wealthy nobles, guard our princes unmenaced near thee, Lord
of Tawny Coursers.  
23 When he goes forth, ye Pair of Kings, for booty, speeding to war and
praise to please the singer,—  
I was the dearest sage of those about him,—let him lead these away and
bring them safely.  
24 Now for this noble man's support and comfort, singing with easy voice
we thus implore thee:  
Impetuous be his son and fleet his courser: and may I be his priest to
win him glory.  
25 If, for our strength, the priest with adoration to win your
friendship made the laud accepted,  
That laud shall be a branching road to virtue for every one to whom the
songs are suited.  
26 Glorified thus, with holy hymns and homage:—Of noble race, with
Waters, God-attended—  
May he enrich us for our prayers and praises: now can the cow be milked;
the path is open.  
27 Be to us, then, ye Gods who merit worship, be ye of one accord our
strong protection,  
Who went on various ways and brought us vigour, ye who are undeceivable
explorers.
