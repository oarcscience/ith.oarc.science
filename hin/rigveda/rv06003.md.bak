### HYMN III. Agni.

1\. TRUE, guardian of the Law, thy faithful servant wins ample light and
dwells in peace, O Agni,  
Whom thou, as Varuṇa in accord with Mitra, guardest, O God, by banishing
his trouble.  
2 He hath paid sacrifices, toiled in worship, and offered gifts to
wealth-increasing Agni.  
Him the displeasure of the famous moves not, outrage and scorn affect
not such a mortal.  
3 Bright God, whose look is free from stain like Sūrya's, thou, swift,
what time thou earnestly desirest,  
Hast gear to give us. Come with joy at evening, where, Child of Wood,
thou mayest also tarry.  
4 Fierce is his gait and vast his wondrous body: he champeth like a
horse with bit and bridle,  
And, darting forth his tongue, as ’twere a hatchet, burning the woods,
smelteth them like a smelter.  
5 Archer-like, fain toshoot, he sets his arrow, and whets his splendour
like the edge of iron:  
The messenger of night with brilliant pathway, like a tree-roosting bird
of rapid pinion.  
6 In beams of morn he clothes him like the singer, and bright as Mitra
with his splendour crackles.  
Red in the night, by day the men's possession: red, he belongs to men by
day, Immortal.  
7 Like Heaven's when scattering beams his voice was uttered: among the
plants the radiant Hero shouted,  
Who with his glow in rapid course came hither to fill both worlds,
well-wedded Dames, with treasure.  
8 Who, with supporting streams and rays that suit him, hath flashed like
lightning with his native vigour.  
Like the deft Maker of the band of Maruts, the bright impetuous One hath
shone refulgent.
