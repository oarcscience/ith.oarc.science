Heritage

### HYMN XXIX Viśvedevas.

1\. ONE is a youth brown, active, manifold he decks the golden one with
ornament.  
2 Another, luminous, occupies the place of sacritice, Sage, among the
Gods.  
3 One brandishes in his hand an iron knife, firm, in his seat amid the
Deities.  
4 Another holds the thunderbolt, wherewith he slays the Vṛtras, resting
in his hand.  
5 Another bears a pointed weapon: bright is he, and strong, with healing
medicines.  
6 Another, thief-like, watches well the ways, and knows the places where
the treasures lie.  
7 Another with his mighty stride hath made his three steps thither where
the Gods rejoice.  
8 Two with one Dame ride on with winged steeds, and journey forth like
travellers on their way.  
9 Two, highest, in the heavens have set their seat, worshipped with holy
oil, imperial Kings.  
10 Some, singing lauds, conceived the Sāma-hymn, great hymn whereby they
caused the Sun to shine.
