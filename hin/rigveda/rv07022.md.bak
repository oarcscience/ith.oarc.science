### HYMN XXII Indra.

1\. DRINK Soma, Lord of Bays, and let it cheer thee: Indra, the stone,
like a well guided courser,  
Directed by the presser's arms hath pressed it.  
2 So let the draught of joy, thy dear companion, by which, O Lord of
Bays, thou slayest foemen,  
Delight thee, Indra, Lord of princely treasures.  
3 Mark closely, Maghavan, the words I utter, this eulogy recited by
Vasiṣṭha:  
Accept the prayers I offer at thy banquet.  
4 Hear thou the call of the juice-drinking press-stone: hear thou the
Brahman's hymn who sings and lauds thee.  
Take to thine inmost self these adorations.  
5 I know and ne’er forget the hymns and praises of thee, the Conqueror,
and thy strength immortal.  
Thy name I ever utter. Self-Refulgent  
6 Among mankind many are thy libations, and many a time the pious
sageinvokes thee.  
O Maghavan, be not long distant from us.  
7 All these libations are for thee, O Hero: to thee I offer these my
prayers. that strengthen.  
Ever, in every place, must men invoke thee.  
8 Never do men attain, O Wonder-Worker, thy greatness, Mighty One, who
must be lauded,  
Nor, Indra, thine heroic power and bounty.  
9 Among all Ṛṣis, Indra, old and recent, who have engendered hymns as
sacred singers,  
Even with us be thine auspicious friendships. Ye Gods, preserve us
evermore with blessings.
