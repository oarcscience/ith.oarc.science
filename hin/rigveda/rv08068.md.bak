### HYMN LXVIII. Soma.

1\. THIS here is Soma, ne’er restrained, active, all-conquering bursting
forth,  
Ṛṣi and Sage by sapience,  
2 All that is bare he covers o’er, all that is sick he medicines;  
The blind man sees, the cripple walks.  
3 Thou, Soma, givest wide defence against the hate of alien men,  
Hatreds that waste and weaken us.  
4 Thou by thine insight and thy skill, Impetuous One, from heaven and
earth  
Drivest the sinner's enmity.  
5 When to their task they come with zeal, may they obtain the Giver's
grace,  
And satisfy his wish who thirsts.  
6 So may he find what erst was lost, so may be speed the pious man,  
And lengthen his remaining life.  
7 Gracious, displaying tender love, unconquered, gentle in thy
thoughts,  
Be sweet, O Soma, to our heart.  
8 O Soma, terrify us not; strike us not with alarm, O King:  
Wound not our heart with dazzling flame.  
9 When in my dwelling-place I see the wicked enemies of Gods,  
King, chase their hatred far away, thou Bounteous One, dispel our foes.
