### HYMN LV. Pūṣan.

1\. SON of Deliverance, come, bright God!  
Let us twain go together: be our charioteer of sacrifice.  
2 We pray for wealth to thee most skilled of charioteers, with braided
hair,  
Lord of great riches, and our Friend.  
3 Bright God whose steeds are goats, thou art a stream of wealth, a
treasure-heap,  
The Friend of every pious man.  
4 Pūṣan, who driveth goats for steeds, the strong and Mighty, who is
called  
His Sister's lover, will we laud.  
5 His Mother's suitor I address. May he who loves his Sister hear,  
Brother of Indra, and my Friend.  
6 May the sure-footed goats come nigh, conveying Pūṣan on his car,  
The God who visiteth mankind.
