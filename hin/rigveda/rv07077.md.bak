### HYMN LXXVIT. Dawn.

1\. SHE hath shone brightly like a youthful woman, stirring to motion
every living creature.  
Agni hath come to feed on mortal? fuel. She hath made light and chased
away the darkness.  
2 Turned to this All, far-spreading, she hath risen and shone in
brightness with white robes about her.  
She hath beamed forth lovely with golden colours, Mother of kine, Guide
of the days she bringeth.  
3 Bearing the Gods’ own Eye, auspicious Lady, leading her Courser white
and fair to look on,  
Distinguished by her bean-is Dawn shines apparent, come forth to all the
world with wondrous treasure.  
4 Draw nigh with wealth and dawn away the foeman: prepare for us wide
pasture free from danger.  
Drive away those who hate us, bring us riches: pour bounty, opulent
Lady, on the singer.  
5 Send thy most excellent beams to shine and light us, giving us
lengthened days, O Dawn, O Goddess,  
Granting us food, thou who hast all things precious, and bounty rich in
chariots, kine, and horses.  
6 O Uṣas, nobly-born, Daughter of Heaven, whom the Vasisthas with their
hymns make mighty,  
Bestow thou on us vast and glorious riches. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
