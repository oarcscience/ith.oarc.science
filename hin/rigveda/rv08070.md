### HYMN LXX. Indra.

1\. INDRA, God of the mighty arm, gather for us with thy right hand  
Manifold and nutritious spoil.  
2 We know thee mighty in thy deeds, of mighty bounty, mighty wealth,  
Mighty in measure, prompt to aid.  
3 Hero, when thou art fain to give, neither may Gods nor mortal men  
Restrain thee like a fearful Bull.  
4 Come, let us glorify Indra, Lord supreme of wealth, Self-ruling
King:  
In bounty may he harm us not.  
5 Let prelude sound and following chant so let him hear the Sāman
sung,  
And with his bounty answer us.  
6 O Indra, with thy right hand bring, and with thy left remember us.  
Let us not lose our share of wealth.  
7 Come nigh, O Bold One, boldly bring hither the riches of the churl  
Who giveth least of all the folk.  
8 Indra, the booty which thou hast with holy singers to receive,  
Even that booty win with us.  
9 Indra, thy swiftly-coming spoil, the booty which rejoices all,  
Sounds quick in concert with our hopes.
