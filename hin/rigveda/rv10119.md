### HYMN CXIX. Indra.

1\. THIS, even this was my resolve, to win a cow, to win a steed:  
Have I not drunk of Soma juice?  
2 Like violent gusts of wind the draughts that I have drunk have lifted
me  
Have I not drunk of Soma juice?  
3 The draughts I drank have borne me up, as fleet-foot horses draw a
car:  
Have I not drunk of Soma juice?  
4 The hymn hath reached me, like a cow who lows to meet her darling
calf:  
Have I not drunk of Soma juice?  
5 As a wright bends a chariot-seat so round my heart I bend the hymn:  
Have I not drunk of Soma juice?  
6 Not as a mote within the eye count the Five Tribes of men with me:  
Have I not drunk of Soma juice?  
7 The heavens and earth themselves have not grown equal to one half of
me  
Have I not drunk of Soma juice?  
8 I in my grandeur have surpassed the heavens and all this spacious
earth  
Have I not drunk of Soma juice?  
9 Aha! this spacious earth will I deposit either here or there  
Have I not drunk of Soma juice?  
10 In one short moment will I smite the earth in fury here or there:  
Have I not drunk of Soma juice?  
11 One of my flanks is in the sky; I let the other trail below:  
Have I not drunk of Soma juice?  
12 1, greatest of the Mighty Ones, am lifted to the firmament:  
Have I not drunk of Soma juice?  
13 I seek the worshipper's abode; oblation-bearer to the Gods:  
Have I not drunk of Soma juice?
