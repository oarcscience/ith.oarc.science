### HYMN LXXI. Aśvins.

1\. THE Night retireth from the Dawn her Sister; the Dark one yieldeth
to the Red her pathway.  
Let us invoke you rich in steeds and cattle - by day and night keep far
from us the arrow.  
2 Bearing rich treasure in your car, O Aśvins, come to the mortal who
presents oblation.  
Keep at a distance penury and sickness; Lovers of Sweetness, day and
night preserve us.  
3 May your strong horses, seeking bliss, bring hither your chariot at
the earliest flush of morning.  
With coursers yoked by Law drive hither, Aśvins, your car whose reins
are light, laden with treasure.  
4 The chariot, Princes, that conveys you, moving at daylight,
triple-seated, fraught with riches,  
Even with this come unto us, Nāsatyas, that laden with all food it may
approach us.  
5 Ye freed Cyavāna from old age and weakness: ye brought the courser
fleet of food to Pedu.  
Ye rescued Atri from distress and darkness, and loosed for Jāhuṣa the
bonds that bound him.  
6 This is the thought, this is the song, O Aśvins: accept this hymn of
ours, ye Steers, With favour.  
May these our prayers addressed to you come nigh you. Preserve us
evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
