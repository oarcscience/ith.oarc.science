### HYMN LIV. Indra.

1\. THOUGH, Indra, thou art called by men from east and west, from north
and south,  
Come hither quickly with fleet steeds  
2 If in the effluence of heaven, rich in its light, thou takest joy,  
Or in the sea in Soma juice.  
3 With songs I call thee, Great and Wide, even as a cow to profit us,  
Indra, to drink the Soma-draught.  
4 Hither, O Indra, let thy Bays bear up and, bring upon thy car  
Thy glory, God! and majesty.  
5 Thou, Indra, wouldst be sung and praised as great, strong, lordly in
thy deeds  
Come hither, drink our Soma juice.  
6 We who have shed the Soma and prepared the feast are calling thee.  
To sit on this our sacred grass.  
7 As, Indra, thou art evermore the common Lord of all alike,  
As such we invocate thee now.  
8 The men with stones have milked for thee this nectar of the Soma
juice:  
Indra, be pleased with it, and drink.  
9 Neglect all pious men with skill in sacred song: come hitherward,  
With speed, and give us high renown.  
10 Gods, may the mighty rest unharmed, the King who gives me spotted
kine,  
Kine decked with golden ornaments.  
11 Beside a thousand spotted kine I have received a gift of gold,  
Pure, brilliant, and exceeding great.  
12 Durgaha's grandsons, giving me a thousand kine, munificent,  
Have won renown among the Gods.
