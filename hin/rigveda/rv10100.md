### HYMN C. Viśvedevas.

1\. Be, like thyself, O Indra, strong for our delight: here lauded, aid
us, Maghavan, drinker of the juice.  
Savitar with the Gods protect us: hear ye Twain. We ask for freedom and
complete felicity.  
2 Bring swift, for offering, the snare that suits the time, to the
pure-drinker Vāyu, roaring as he goes,  
To him who hath approached the draught of shining milk. We ask for
freedom and complete felicity.  
3 May Savitar the God send us full life, to each who sacrifices, lives
aright and pours the juice  
That we with simple hearts may wait upon the Gods. We ask for freedom
and complete felicity.  
4 May Indra evermore be gracious unto us, and may King Soma meditate our
happiness,  
Even as men secure the comfort of a friend. We ask for freedom and
complete felicity.  
5 Indra hath given the body with its song and strength: Bṛhaspati, thou
art the lengthener of life.  
The sacrifice is Manu, Providence, our Sire. We ask for freedom and
complete felicity.  
6 Indra possesseth might celestial nobly formed: the singer in the house
is Agni, prudent Sage.  
He is the sacrifice in synod, fair, most near. We ask for freedom and
complete felicity,  
7 Not often have we sinned against you secretly, nor, Vasus, have we
openly provoked the Gods.  
Not one of its, ye Gods, hath worn an alien shape. We ask for freedom
and complete felicity.  
8 May Savitar remove from us our malady, and may the Mountains keep it
far away from where  
The press-stone as it sheds the meath rings loudly forth. We ask for
freedom and complete felicity.  
9 Ye Vasus, let the stone, the presser stand erect: avert all enmities
and keep them far remote.  
Our guard to be adored is Savitar this God. We ask for freedom and
complete felicity.  
10 Eat strength and fatness in the pasture, kine, who are balmed at the
reservoir and at the seat of Law.  
So let your body be our body's medicine. We ask for freedom and complete
felicity.  
11 The singer fills the spirit: all mens, love hath he. Indra takes
kindly care of those who pour the juice.  
For his libation is the heavenly udder full. We ask for freedom and
complete felicity.  
12 Wondrous thy spirit-filling light, triumpliant; thy hosts save from
decay and are resistless.  
The pious votary by straightest pathway speeds to possess the best of
all the cattle.
