### HYMN CLXVII. Indra.

1\. THIS pleasant meath, O Indra, is effused for thee: thou art the
ruling Lord of beaker and of juice.  
Bestow upon us wealth with many hero sons: thou, having glowed with
Fervour, wonnest heavenly light.  
2 Let us call Śakra to libations here effused, winner of light who
joyeth in the potent juice.  
Mark well this sacrifice of ours and come to us: we pray to Maghavan the
Vanquisher of hosts.  
3 By royal Soma's and by Varuṇa's decree, under Bṛhaspati's and
Anumati's guard,  
This day by thine authority, O Maghavan, Maker, Disposer thou! have I
enjoyed the jars.  
4 1, too, urged on, have had my portion, in the bowl, and as first
Prince I drew forth this my hymn of praise,  
When with the prize I came unto the flowing juice, O Viśvāmitra,
Jamadagni, to your home.
