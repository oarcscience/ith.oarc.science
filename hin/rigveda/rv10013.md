Heritage

### HYMN XIII Havirdhanas.

1\. I YOKE with prayer your ancient inspiration: may the laud rise as on
the prince's pathway.  
All Sons of Immortality shall hear it, all the possessors of celestial
natures.  
2 When speeding ye came nigh us like twin sisters, religious-hearted
votaries brought you forward.  
Take your place, ye who know your proper station: be near, be very near
unto our Soma.  
3 Five paces have I risen from Earth. I follow her who hath four feet
with devout observance.  
This by the Sacred Syllable have I measured: I purify in the central
place of Order,  
4 He, for God's sake, chose death to be his portion. He chose not, for
men's good, a life eternal  
They sacrificed Bṛhaspati the Ṛṣi. Yama delivered up his own dear
body.  
5 The Seven flow to the Youth on whom the Maruts wait: the Sons unto the
Father brought the sacrifice.  
Both these are his, as his they are the Lords of both: both toil;
belonging unto both they prosper well.
