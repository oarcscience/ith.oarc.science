### HYMN XI. Indra.

1 ALL sacred songs have magnified Indra expansive as the sea,  
The best of warriors borne on cars, the Lord, the very Lord of
strength.  
2 Strong in thy friendship, Indra, Lord of power and might, we have no
fear.  
We glorify with praises thee, the never-conquered conqueror.  
3 The gifts of Indra from of old, his saving succours, never fail,  
When to the praise-singers he gives the boon of substance rich in
kine.  
4 Crusher of forts, the young, the wise, of strength unmeasured, was he
born  
Sustainer of each sacred rite, Indra, the Thunderer, much-extolled.  
5 Lord of the thunder, thou didst burst the cave of Vala rich in cows.  
The Gods came pressing to thy side, and free from terror aided thee,  
6 I, Hero, through thy bounties am come to the flood addressing thee.  
Song-lover, here the singers stand and testify to thee thereof.  
7 The wily Śuṣṇa, Indra! thou o’erthrewest with thy wondrous powers.  
The wise beheld this deed of thine: now go beyond their eulogies.  
8 Our songs of praise have glorified Indra who ruleth by his might,  
Whose precious gifts in thousands come, yea, even more abundantly.
