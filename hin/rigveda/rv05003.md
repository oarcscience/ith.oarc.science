### HYMN III. Agni.

1\. THOU at thy birth art Varuṇa, O Agni; when thou art kindled thou
becomest Mitra.  
In thee, O Son of Strength, all Gods are centred. Indra art thou to man
who brings oblation.  
2 Aryaman art thou as regardeth maidens mysterious, is thy name, O
Self-sustainer.  
As a kind friend with streams of milk they balm thee what time thou
makest wife and lord one-minded.  
3 The Maruts deck their beauty for thy glory, yea, Rudra! for thy birth
fair, brightly-coloured.  
That which was fixed as Viṣṇu's loftiest station—therewith the secret of
the Cows thou guardest.  
4 Gods through thy glory, God who art so lovely! granting abundant gifts
gained life immortal.  
As their own Priest have men established Agni; and serve him fain for
praise from him who liveth.  
5 There is no priest more skilled than thou in worship; none
Self-sustainer pass thee in wisdom.  
The man within whose house as guest thou dwellest, O God, by sacrifice
shall conquer mortals.  
6 Aided by thee, O Agni may we conquer through our oblation, fain for
wealth, awakened:  
May we in battle, in the days’ assemblies, O Son of Strength, by riches
conquer mortals.  
7 He shall bring evil on the evil-plotter whoever turns against us sin
and outrage.  
Destroy this calumny of him, O Agni, whoever injures us with
double-dealing.  
8 At this dawn's flushing, God! our ancient fathers served thee with
offerings, making thee their envoy,  
When, Agni, to the store of wealth thou goest, a God enkindled with good
things by mortals.  
9 Save, thou who knowest, draw thy father near thee, who counts as thine
own son, O Child of Power.  
O sapient Agni, when wilt thou regard us? When, skilled in holy Law,
wilt thou direct us?  
10 Adoring thee he gives thee many a title, when thou, Good Lord!
acceptest this as Father.  
And doth not Agni, glad in strength of Godhead, gain splendid bliss when
he hath waxen mighty?  
11 Most Youthful Agni, verily thou bearest thy praiser safely over all
his troubles.  
Thieves have been seen by us and open foemen: unknown have been the
plottings of the wicked.  
12 To thee these eulogies have been directed: or to the Vasu hath this
sin been spoken.  
But this our Agni, flaming high, shall never yield us to calumny, to him
who wrongs us.
