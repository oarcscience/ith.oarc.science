### HYMN CXLVIII. Agni.

1\. WHAT Mātariśvan, piercing, formed by friction, Herald of all the
Gods. in varied figure,  
Is he whom they have set mid human houses, gay-hued as light and shining
forth for beauty.  
2 They shall not harm the man who brings thee praises: such as I am,
Agni my help approves me.  
All acts of mine shall they accept with pleasure, laudation from the
singer who presents it.  
3 Him in his constant seat men skilled in worship have taken and with
praises have established.  
As, harnessed to a chariot fleet-foot horses, at his command let bearers
lead him forward.  
4 Wondrous, full many a thing he chews and crunches: he shines amid the
wood with spreading brightness.  
Upon his glowing flames the wind blows daily, driving them like the keen
shaft of an archer.  
5 Him, whom while yet in embryo the hostile, both skilled and fain to
harm, may never injure,  
Men blind and sightless through his splendour hurt not: his
never-failing lovers have preserved him.
