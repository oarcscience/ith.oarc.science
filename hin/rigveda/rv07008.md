### HYMN VIII. Agni

1\. THE King whose face is decked with oil is kindled with homage
offered by his faithful servant.  
The men, the priests adore him with oblations. Agni hath shone forth
when the dawn is breaking.  
2 Yea, he hath been acknowledged as most mighty, the joyous Priest of
men, the youthful Agni.  
He, spreading o’er the earth, made light around him, and grew among the
plants with blackened fellies..  
3 How dost thou decorate our hymn, O Agni? What power dost thou exert
when thou art lauded?  
When, Bounteous God, may we be lords of riches, winners of precious
wealth which none may conquer?  
4 Far famed is this the Bhārata's own Agni he shineth like the Sun with
lofty splendour.  
He who hath vanquished Pūru in the battle, the heavenly guest hath
glowed in full refulgence.  
5 Full many oblations are in thee collected: with all thine aspects thou
hast waxen gracious.  
Thou art already famed as praised and lauded, yet still, O nobly born,
increase thy body.  
6 Be this my song, that winneth countless treasure, engendered with
redoubled force for Agni,  
That, splendid, chasing sickness, slaying demons, it may delight our
friend and bless the singers.  
7 We, the Vasisthas, now implore thee, Agni, O Son of Strength, the Lord
of wealth and riches.  
Thou hast brought food to singers and to nobles. Ye Gods, preserve us
evermore with blessings.
