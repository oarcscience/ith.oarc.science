### HYMN XXXVIII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THIS Steer, this Chariot, rushes through the woollen filter, as he
goes  
To war that wins a thousand spoils.  
2 The Dames of Trita with the stones onward impel this Tawny One  
Indu to Indra for his drink.  
3 Ten active fingers carefully adorn him here; they make him bright  
And beauteous for the gladdening draught.  
4 He like a falcon settles down amid the families of men.  
Speeding like lover to his love.  
5 This young exhilarating juice looks downward from its place in
heaven,  
This Soma-drop that pierced the sieve.  
6 Poured for the draught, this tawny juice  
flows forth, intelligent, crying out,  
Unto the well-beloved place.
