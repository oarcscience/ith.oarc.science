### HYMN XVIII. Agni.

1\. AT dawn let Agni, much-beloved guest of the house, be glorified;  
Immortal who delights in all oblations brought by mortal men.  
2 For Dvita who receives through wealth of native strength maimed
offerings,  
Thy praiser even gains at once the Soma-drops, Immortal Gods!  
3 Nobles, with song I call that car of yours that shines with lengthened
life,  
For, God who givest steeds! that car hither and thither goes unharmed.  
4 They who have varied ways of thought, who guard the lauds within their
lips,  
And strew the grass before the light, have decked themselves with high
renown.  
5 Immortal Agni, give the chiefs, heroes who institute the rite,  
Heroes’ illustrious, lofty fame, who at the synod met for praise
presented me with fifty steeds.
