### HYMN VII.

1\. THE seven tones risen from the whitebacked viand have made their way
between the pair of Mothers.  
Both circumjacent Parents come together to yield us length of days they
hasten forward.  
2 The Male who dwells in heaven hath Mares and Milchkine: he came to
Goddesses who bring sweet treasure.  
To thee safe resting in the seat of Order the Cow alone upon her way
proceedeth.  
3 Wise Master, wealthy finder-out of riches, he mounted those who may
with case be guided.  
He, dark-backed, manifold with varied aspect, hath made them burst forth
from their food the brush-wood.  
4 Strength-giving streams bear hither him eternal, fain to support the
mighty work. of Tvaṣṭar.  
He, flashing in his home with all his members, hath entered both the
worlds as they were single.  
5 They know the red Bull's blessing, and are joyful under the
flaming-coloured Lord's dominion:  
They who give shine from heavenwith fair effulgence, whose lofty song
like Iḷā must be honoured.  
6 Yea, by tradition from the ancient sages they brought great strength
from the two mighty Parents,  
To where the singer's Bull, the night's dispeller, after his proper law
hath waxen stronger.  
7 Seven holy singers guard with five Adhvaryus the Bird's beloved
firmly-settled station.  
The willing Bulls, untouched by old, rejoice them: as Gods themselves
the ways of Gods they follow.  
8 I crave the grace of heaven's two chief Invokers: the seven swift
steeds joy in their wonted manner.  
These speak of truth, praising the Truth Eternal, thinking on Order as
the guards of Order.  
9 The many seek the great Steed as a stallion: the reins obey the Lord
of varied colour.  
O heavenly Priest, most pleasant, full of wisdom, bring the great Gods
to us, and Earth and Heaven.  
10 Rich Lord, the Mornings have gleamed forth in splendour, fair-rayed,
fair-speaking, worshipped with all viands,  
Yea, with the glory of the earth, O Agni. Forgive us, for our weal, e’en
sin cornmitted.  
11 As holy food, Agni, to thine invoker, give wealth in cattle, lasting,
rich in marvels.  
To us be born a son, and spreading offspring Agni, be this thy gracious
will to usward.
