### HYMN II. Agni.

1\. THE youthful Mother keeps the Boy in secret pressed to her close,
nor yields him to the Father.  
But, when he lies upon the arm, the people see his unfading countenance
before them.  
2 What child is this thou carriest as handmaid, O Youthful One? The
Consort-Queen hath borne him.  
The Babe unborn increased through many autumns. I saw him born what time
his Mother bare him.  
3 I saw him from afar gold-toothed, bright-coloured, hurling his weapons
from his habitation,  
What time I gave him Amṛta free from mixture. How can the Indraless, the
hymnless harm me?  
4 I saw him moving from the place he dwells in, even as with a herd,
brilliantly shining.  
These seized him not: he had been born already. They who were grey with
age again grow youthful.  
5 Who separate my young bull from the cattle, they whose protector was
in truth no stranger?  
Let those whose hands have seized upon them free them. May he,
observant, drive the herd to us-ward.  
6 Mid mortal men godless have secreted the King of all who live, home of
the people.  
So may the prayers of Atri give him freedom. Reproached in turn be those
who now reproach him.  
7 Thou from the stake didst loose e’en Śunaḥśepa bound for a thousand;
for he prayed with fervour.  
So, Agni, loose from us the bonds that bind us, when thou art seated
here, O Priest who knowest.  
8 Thou hast sped from me, Agni, in thine anger: this the protector of
Gods’ Laws hath told me.  
Indra who knoweth bent his eye upon thee: by him instructed am I come, O
Agni.  
9 Agni shines far and wide with lofty splendour, and by his greatness
makes all things apparent.  
He conquers godless and malign enchantments, and sharpens both his horns
to gore the Rakṣas.  
10 Loud in the heaven above be Agni's roarings with keen-edged weapons
to destroy the demons.  
Forth burst his splendours in the Soma's rapture. The godless bands
press round but cannot stay him.  
11 As a skilled craftsman makes a car, a singer I, Mighty One! this hymn
for thee have fashioned.  
If thou, O Agni, God, accept it gladly, may we obtain thereby the
heavenly Waters.  
12 May he, the strong-necked Steer, waxing in vigour, gather the
foeman's wealth with none to check him.  
Thus to this Agni have the Immortals spoken. To man who spreads the
grass may he grant shelter, grant shelter to the man who brings
oblation.
