Heritage

### HYMN XIV. Agni.

1\. ENKINDLING the Immortal, wake Agni with song of praise: may he bear
our oblations to the Gods.  
2 At high solemnities mortal men glorify him the Immortal, best  
At sacrifice among mankind.  
3 That he may bear their gifts to heaven, all glorify him Agni, God,  
With ladle that distilleth oil.  
4 Agni shone bright when born, with light killing the Dasyus and the
dark:  
He found the Kine, the Floods, the Sun.  
5 Serve Agni, God adorable, the Sage whose back is balmed with oil:  
Let him approach, and hear my call.  
6 They have exalted Agni, God of all mankind, with oil and hymns  
Of praise, devout and eloquent.
