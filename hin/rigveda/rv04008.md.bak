### HYMN VIII. Agni.

1\. YOUR envoy who possesses all, Immortal, bearer of your gifts,  
Best worshipper, I woo with song.  
2 He, Mighty, knows the gift of wealth, he knows the deep recess of
heaven:  
He shall bring hitherward the Gods.  
3 He knows, a God himself, to guide Gods to the righteous in his home:  
He gives e’en treasures that we love.  
4 He is the Herald: well-informed, he doth his errand to and fro,  
Knowing the deep recess of heaven.  
5 May we be they who gratify Agni with sacrificial gifts,  
Who cherish and enkindle him.  
6 Illustrious for wealth are they, and hero deeds, victorious,  
Who have served Agni reverently.  
7 So unto us, day after day, may riches craved by many come,  
And power and might spring up for us.  
8 That holy Singer in his strength shoots forth his arrows swifter
than  
The swift shafts of the tribes of men.
