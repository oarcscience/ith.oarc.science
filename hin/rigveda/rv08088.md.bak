### HYMN LXXXVIII. Indra.

1\. O THUNDERER, zealous worshippers gave thee drink this time
yesterday.  
So, Indra, listen here to those who bring the laud: come near unto our
dwellingplace.  
2 Lord of Bay Steeds, fair-helmed, rejoice thee: this we crave. Here the
disposers wait on thee.  
Thy loftiest glories claim our lauds beside the juice, O Indra, Lover of
the Song.  
3 Turning, as ’twere, to meet the Sun, enjoy from Indra all good
things.  
When he who will be born is born with power we look to treasures as our
heritage.  
4 Praise him who sends us wealth, whose bounties injure none: good are
the gifts which Indra. grants.  
He is not worth with one who satisfies his wish: he turns his mind to
giving boons.  
5 Thou in thy battles, Indra, art subduer of all hostile bands.  
Father art thou, aIl-conquering, cancelling the curse, thou victor of
the vanquisher.  
6 The Earth and Heaven clung close to thy victorious might as to their
calf two mother-cows.  
When thou attackest Vṛtra all the hostile bands shrink and faint, Indra,
at thy wrath.  
7 Bring to your aid the Eternal One, who shoots and none may shoot at
him,  
Inciter, swift, victorious, best of Charioteers. Tugrya's unvanquished
Strengthener;  
8 Arranger of things unarranged, e’en Śatakratu, source of might,  
Indra, the Friend of all, for succour we invoke, Guardian of treasure,
sendjng wealth.
