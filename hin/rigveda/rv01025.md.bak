### HYMN XXV. Varuṇa.

1 WHATEVER law of thine, O God, O Varuṇa, as we are men,  
Day after day we violate.  
2 give us not as a prey to death, to be destroyed by thee in wrath,  
To thy fierce anger when displeased.  
3 To gain thy mercy, Varuṇa, with hymns we bind thy heart, as binds  
The charioteer his tethered horse.  
4 They flee from me dispirited, bent only on obtaining wealth,  
As to their nests the birds of air.  
5 When shall we bring, to be appeased, the Hero, Lord of warrior
might,  
Him, the far-seeing Varuṇa?  
6 This, this with joy they both accept in common: never do they fail  
The ever-faithful worshipper.  
7 He knows the path of birds that fly through heaven, and, Sovran of the
sea,  
He knows the ships that are thereon.  
8 True to his holy law, he knows the twelve moons with their progeny:  
He knows the moon of later birth.  
9 He knows the pathway of the wind, the spreading, high, and mighty
wind:  
He knows the Gods who dwell above.  
10 Varuṇa, true to holy law, sits down among his people; he,  
Most wise, sits there to govern all.  
11 From thence [perceiving](errata.htm#1.md) he beholds all wondrous
things, both what hath been,  
And what hereafter will be done.  
12 May that Āditya, very wise, make fair paths for us all our days:  
May he prolong our lives for us.  
13 Varuṇa, wearing golden mail, hath clad him in a shining robe.  
His spies are seated found about.  
14 The God whom enemies threaten not, nor those who tyrannize o’er
men,  
Nor those whose minds are bent on wrong.  
15 He who gives glory to mankind, not glory that is incomplete,  
To our own bodies giving it.  
16 Yearning for the wide-seeing One, my thoughts move onward unto him,  
As kine unto their pastures move.  
17 Once more together let us speak, because my meath is brought:
priest-like  
Thou eatest what is dear to thee.  
18 Now saw I him whom all may see, I saw his car above the earth:  
He hath accepted these my songs.  
19 Varuṇa, hear this call of mine: be gracious unto us this day  
Longing for help I cried to thee.  
20 Thou, O wise God, art Lord of all, thou art the King of earth and
heaven  
Hear, as thou goest on thy way.  
21 Release us from the upper bond, untie the bond between, and loose  
The bonds below, that I may live.
