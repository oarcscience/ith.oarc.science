### HYMN LVI. Maruts.

1\. Wno are these radiant men in serried rank, Rudra's young heroes
borne by noble steeds?  
2 Verily no one knoweth whence they sprang: they, and they only, know
each other's birth.  
3 They strew each other with their blasts, these Hawks: they strove
together, roaring like the wind.  
4 A sage was he who knew these mysteries, what in her udder mighty Pṛśni
bore.  
5 Ever victorious, through the Maruts, be this band of Heroes, nursing
manly strength,  
6 Most bright in splendour, flectest on their way, close-knit to glory,
strong with varied power.  
7 Yea, mighty is your power and firm your strength: so, potent, with the
Maruts, be the band.  
8 Bright is your spirit, wrathful are your minds: your bold troop's
minstrel is like one inspired.  
9 Ever avert your blazing shaft from us, and let not your displeasure
reach us here  
10 Your dear names, conquering Maruts, we invoke, calling aloud till we
are satisfied.  
11 Well-armed, impetuous in their haste, they deck themselves, their
forms, with oblations: to you, the pure, ornaments made of gold.  
12 Pure, Maruts, pure yourselves, are your oblations: to you, the pure,
pure sacrifice I offer.  
By Law they came to truth, the Law's observers, bright by their birth,
and pure, and sanctifying.  
13 Your rings, O Maruts, rest upon your shoulders, and chains of gold
are twined upon your bosoms.  
Gleaming with drops of rain, like lightning-flashes, after your wont ye
whirl about your weapons.  
14 Wide in the depth of air spread forth your glories, far, most
adorable, ye bear your titles.  
Maruts, accept this thousandfold allotment of household sacrifice and
household treasure.  
15 If, Maruts, ye regard the praise recited here at this mighty singer
invocation,  
Vouchsafe us quickly wealth with noble heroes, wealth which no man uho
hateth us may injure.  
16 The Maruts, fleet as coursers, while they deck them like youths
spectators of a festal meeting,  
Linger, like beauteous colts, about the dwelling, like frisking calves,
these who pour down the water.  
17 So may the Maruts help us and be gracious, bringing free room to
lovely Earth and Heaven.  
Far be your bolt that slayeth men and cattle. Ye Vasus, turn yourselves
to us with blessings.  
18 The priest, when seated, loudly calls you, Maruts, praising in song
your universal bounty.  
He, Bulls! who hath so much in his possession, free from duplicity, with
hymns invokes you.  
19 These Maruts bring the swift man to a stand-still, and strength with
mightier strength they break and humble  
These guard the singer from the man who hates him and lay their sore
displeasure on the wicked.  
20 These Maruts rouse even the poor and needy: the Vasus love him as an
active champion.  
Drive to a distance, O ye Bulls, the darkness: give us full store of
children and descendants.  
21 Never, O Maruts, may we lose your bounty, nor, car-borne Lords! be
hitidmost when ye deal it.  
Give us a share in that delightful treasure, the genuine wealth that,
Bulls! is your possession.  
22 What time the men in fury rush together for running streams, for
pastures, and for houses.  
Then, O ye Maruts, ye who spring from Rudra, be our protectors in the
strife with foemen.  
23 Full many a deed ye did for our forefathers worthy of lauds which,
even of old, they sang you.  
lle strong man, with the Maruts, wins in battle, the charger, with the
Maruts, gains the booty.  
24 Ours, O ye Maruts, be the vigorous Hero, the Lord Divine of men, the
strong Sustainer,  
With whom to fair lands we may cross the waters, and dwell in our own
home with you beside us.  
25 May Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa and Agni, Waters, and Plants, and Trees
accept our praises.  
May we find shelter in the Marut's bosom. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods,
with blessings.
