### HYMN LX. Maruts.

1\. I LAUD with reverence the gracious Agni: here may he sit and part
our meed among us.  
As with spoil-seeking cars I bring oblation: turned rightward I will
swell the Marut's, praise-song.  
2 The Maruts, yea, the Rudras, who have mounted their famous spotted
deer and cars swift-moving,—  
Before you, fierce Ones! woods bow down in terror: Earth, even the
mountain, trembles at your coming.  
3 Though vast and tall, the mountain is affrighted, the height of heaven
is shaken at your roaring  
When, armed with lances, ye are sporting, Maruts, and rush along
together like the waters.  
4 They, like young suitors, sons of wealthy houses, have with their
golden natures decked their bodies.  
Strong on their cars, the lordly Ones, for glory, have set their
splendours on their forms for ever.  
5 None being eldest, none among them youngest, as brothers they have
grown to happy fortune.  
May their Sire Rudra, young and deft, and Pṛśni pouring much milk, bring
fair days to the Maruts.  
6 Whether, O blessed Maruts, ye be dwelling in highest, midmost, or in
lowest heaven,  
Thence, O ye Rudras, and thou also, Agni, notice the sacrificial food we
offer.  
7 O Maruts, Lords of all, when Agni and when ye drive downward from
sublimest heaven along the heights,  
Shakers of all, rejoicing, slayers of the foe, give riches to the
Soma-pressing worshipper.  
8 O Agni, with the Maruts as they gleam and sing, gathered in troop,
rejoicing drink the Soma juice;  
With these the living ones who cleanse and further all, joined with thy
banner, O Vaiśvānara, from of old.
