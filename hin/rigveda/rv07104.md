### HYMN CIV. Indra-Soma.

1\. INDRA and Soma, burn, destroy the demon foe, send downward, O ye
Bulls, those who add gloom to gloom.  
Annihilate the fools, slay them and burn them up: chase them away from
us, pierce the voracious ones.  
2 Indra and Soma, let sin round the wicked boil like as a caldron set
amid the flames of fire.  
Against the foe of prayer, devourer of raw flesh, the vile fiend fierce
of eye, keep ye perpetual hate.  
3 Indra and Soma, plunge the wicked in the depth, yea, cast them into
darkness that hath no support,  
So that not one of them may ever thence return: so may your wrathful
might prevail and conquer them.  
4 Indra and Soma, hurl your deadly crushing bolt down on the wicked
fiend from heaven and from the earth.  
Yea, forge out of the mountains your celestial dart wherewith ye burn to
death the waxing demon race.  
5 Indra and Soma, cast ye downward out of heaven your deadly darts of
stone burning with fiery flame,  
Eternal, scorching darts; plunge the voracious ones within the depth,
and let them sink without a sound.  
6 Indra and Soma, let this hymn control you both, even as the girth
encompasses two vigorous steeds-  
The song of praise which I with wisdom offer you: do ye, as Lords of
men, animate these my prayers.  
7 In your impetuous manner think ye both thereon: destroy these evil
beings, slay the treacherous fiends.  
Indra and Soma, let the wicked have no bliss who evermore assails us
with malignity.  
8 Whoso accuses me with words of falsehood when I pursue my way with
guileless spirit,  
May he, the speaker of untruth, be, Indra, like water which the hollowed
hand compresses.  
9 Those who destroy, as is their wont, the simple, and with their evil
natures barm the righteous,  
May Soma give them over to the serpent, or to the lap of Nirrti consign
them.  
10 The fiend, O Agni, who designs to injure the essence of our food,
kine, steeds, or bodies,  
May he, the adversary, thief, and robber, sink to destruction, both
himself and offipring.  
11 May he be swept away, himself and children: may all the three earths
press him down beneath them.  
May his fair glory, O ye Gods, be blighted, who in the day or night
would fain destroy us.  
12 The prudent finds it easy to distinguish the true and false: their
words oppose each other.  
Of these two that which is the true and honest, Soma protects, and
brings the false to nothing.  
13 Never doth Soma aid and guide the wicked or him who falsely claims
the Warrior's title.  
He slays the fiend and him who speaks untruly: both lie entangled in the
noose of Indra.  
14 As if I worshipped deities of falsehood, or thought vain thoughts
about the Gods, O Agni.  
Why art thou angry with us, Jātavedas? Destruction fall on those who lie
against thee!  
15 So may I die this day if I have harassed any man's life or if I be a
demon.  
Yea, may he lose all his ten sons together who with false tongue hath
called me Yātudhāna.  
16 May Indra slay him with a mighty weapon, and let the vilest of all
creatures perish,  
The fiend who says that he is pure, who calls me a demon though devoid
of demon nature.  
17 She too who wanders like an owl at night-time, hiding her body in her
guile and malice,  
May she fall downward into endless caverns. May press-stones with loud
ring destroy the demons.  
18 Spread out, ye Maruts, search among the people: seize ye and grind
the Rākṣasas to pieces,  
Who fly abroad, transformed to birds, at night-time, or sully and
pollute our holy worship.  
19 Hurl down from heaven thy bolt of stone, O Indra: sharpen it,
Maghavan, made keen by Soma.  
Forward, behind, and from above and under, smite down the demons with
thy rocky weapon.  
20 They fly, the demon dogs, and, bent on mischief, fain would they harm
indomitable Indra.  
Śakra makes sharp his weapon for the wicked: now, let him cast his bolt
at fiendish wizards.  
21 Indra hath ever been the fiends’ destroyer who spoil oblations of the
Gods’ invokers:  
Yea, Śakra, like an axe that [splits](errata.htm#19.md) the timber, attacks
and smashes them like earthen vessels.  
22 Destroy the fiend shaped like an owl or owlet, destroy him in the
form of dog or cuckoo.  
Destroy him shaped as eagle or as vulture as with a stone, O Indra,
crush the demon.  
23 Let not the fiend of witchcraft-workers reach us: may Dawn drive off
the couples of Kimīdins.  
Earth keep us safe from earthly woe and trouble: from grief that comes
from heaven mid-air preserve us.  
24 Slay the male demon, Indra! slay the female, joying and triumphing in
arts of magic.  
Let the fools' gods with bent necks fall and perish, and see no more the
Sun when he arises.  
25 Look each one hither, look around Indra and Soma, watch ye well.
