### HYMN III. Indra.

1\. DRINK, Indra, of the savoury juice, and cheer thee with our milky
draught.  
Be, for our weal, our Friend and sharer of the feast, and let thy wisdom
guard us well.  
2 In thy kind grace and favour may we still be strong: expose us not to
foe's attack.  
With manifold assistance guard and succour us, and bring us to
felicity.  
3 May these my songs of praise exalt thee, Lord, who hast abundant
wealth.  
Men skilled in holy hymns, pure, with the hues of fire, have sung them
with their lauds to thee.  
4 He, with his might enhanced by Ṛṣis thousandfold, hath like an ocean
spread himself.  
His majesty is praised as true at solemn rites, his power where holy
singers rule.  
5 Indra for worship of the Gods, Indra while sacrifice proceeds,  
Indra, as worshippers in battle-shock, we call, Indra that we may win
the spoil.  
6 With might hath Indra spread out heaven and earth, with power hath
Indra lighted up the Sun.  
In Indra are all creatures closely held; in him meet the distilling
Soma-drops.  
7 Men with their lauds are urging thee, Indra, to drink the Soma
first.  
The Ṛbhus in accord have lifted up their voice, and Rudras sung thee as
the first.  
8 Indra increased his manly strength at sacrifice, in the wild rapture
of this juice.  
And living men to-day, even as of old, sing forth their praises to his
majesty.  
9 I crave of thee that hero strength, that thou mayst first regard this
prayer,  
Wherewith thou holpest Bhṛgu and the Yatis and Praskaṇva when the prize
was staked.  
10 Wherewith thou sentest mighty waters to the sea, that, Indra, is thy
manly strength.  
For ever unattainable is this power of him to whom the worlds have cried
aloud.  
11 Help us, O Indra, when we pray to thee for wealth and hero might.  
First help thou on to strength the man who strives to win, and aid our
laud, O Ancient One.  
12 Help for us, Indra, as thou holpest Paura once, this man's devotions
bent on gain.  
Help, as thou gavest Ruśama and Śyāvaka and Svarṇara and Kṛpa aid.  
13 What newest of imploring prayers shall, then, the zealous mortal
sing?  
For have not they who laud his might, and Indra-power won for themselves
the light of heaven?  
14 When shall they keep the Law and praise thee mid the Gods? Who counts
as Ṛṣi and as sage?  
When ever wilt thou, Indra Maghavan, come nigh to presser's or to
praiser's call?  
15 These songs of ours exceeding sweet, these hymns of praise ascend to
thee,  
Like ever-conquering chariots that display their strength, gain wealth,
and give unfailing aid.  
16 The Bhṛgus are like Suns, like Kaṇvas, and have gained all that their
thoughts were bent upon.  
The living men of Priyamedha's race have sung exalting Indra with their
lauds.  
17 Best slayer of the Vṛtras, yoke thy Bay Steeds, Indra, from afar.  
Come with the High Ones hither, Maghavan, to us, Mighty, to drink the
Soma juice.  
18 For these, the bards and singers, have cried out to thee with prayer,
to gain the sacrifice.  
As such, O Maghavan, Indra, who lovest song, even as a lover bear my
call.  
19 Thou from the lofty plains above, O Indra, hurledst Vṛtra down.  
Thou dravest forth the kine of guileful Mṛgaya and Arbuda from the
mountain's hold.  
20 Bright were the flaming fires, the Sun gave forth his shine, and
Soma, Indra's juice, shone clear.  
Indra, thou blewest the great Dragon from the air: men must regard that
valorous deed.  
21 The fairest courser of them all, who runneth on as ’twere to
heaven.  
Which Indra and the Maruts gave, and Pākasthāman Kaurayāṇ.  
22 To me hath Pākasthāman given, a ruddy horse, good at the pole,  
Filling is girth and rousing wealth;  
23 Compared with whom no other ten strong coursers, harnessed to the
pole,  
Bear Tugrya to his dwelling place.  
24 Raiment is body, food is life, and healing ointment giveth
strength.  
As the free-handed giver of the ruddy steed, I have named Pākasthāman
fourth.
