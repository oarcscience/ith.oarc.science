### HYMN XLII. Indra.

1\. COME to the juice that we have pressed, to Soma, Indra, bleat with
milk:  
Come, favouring us, thy Bay-drawn car!  
2 Come, Indra, to this gladdening drink, placed on the grass, pressed
out with stones:  
Wilt thou not drink thy fill thereof?  
3 To Indra have my songs of praise gone forth, thus rapidly sent
hence,  
To turn him to the Soma-draught.  
4 Hither with songs of praise we call Indra to drink the Soma juice:  
Will he not come to us by lauds?  
5 Indra, these Somas are expressed. Take them within thy belly, Lord  
Of Hundred Powers, thou Prince of Wealth.  
6 We know thee winner of the spoil, and resolute in battles, Sage!  
Therefore thy blessing we implore.  
7 Borne hither by thy Stallions, drink, Indra, this juice which we have
pressed,  
Mingled with barley and with milk.  
8 Indra, for thee, in thine own place, I urge the Soma for thy
draught:  
Deep in thy heart let it remain,  
9 We call on thee, the Ancient One, Indra, to drink the Soma juice,  
We Kuśikas who seek thine aid.
