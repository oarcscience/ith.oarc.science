### HYMN XX. Indra.

1\. GIVE us wealth, Indra, that with might, as heaven o’ertops the
earth, o’ercomes our foes in battle  
Wealth that brings thousands and that wins the corn-lands, wealth, Son
of Strength! that vanquishes the foeman.  
2 Even as the power of Dyaus, to thee, O Indra, all Asura sway was by
the Gods entrusted,  
When thou, Impetuous! leagued with Viṣṇu, slewest Vṛtra the Dragon who
enclosed the waters.  
3 Indra, Strong, Victor, Mightier than the mighty, addressed with prayer
and perfect in his splendour,  
Lord of the bolt that breaketh forts in pieces, became the King of the
sweet juice of Soma..  
4 There, Indra, while the light was won, the Paṇis f1ed, 'neath a
hundred blows, for wise Dasoni,  
And greedy Śuṣṇa's magical devices nor left he any of their food
remaining.  
5 What time the thunder fell and Śuṣṇa perished, all life's support from
the great Druh was taken.  
Indra made room for his car-drivcr Kutsa who sate beside him, when he
gained the sunlight.  
6 As the Hawk rent for him the stalk that gladdens, he wrenched the head
from Namuci the Dāsa.  
He guarded Nam, Sayya's son, in slumber, and sated him with food,
success, and riches.  
7 Thou, thunder-armed, with thy great might hast shattered Pipru's
strong forts who knew the wiles of serpents.  
Thou gavest to thy worshipper Ṛjiśvan imperishable Wealth, O Bounteous
Giver.  
8 The crafty Vetasu, the swift Dasni, and Tugra speedily with all his
servants,  
Hath Indra, gladdening with strong assistance, forced near as ’twere to
glorify the Mother.  
9 Resistless, with the hosts he battles, bearing in both his arms the
Vṛtra-slaying thunder.  
He mounts his Bays, as the car-seat an archer: yoked at a word they bear
the lofty Indra.  
10 May we, O Indra, gain by thy new favour: so Parus laud thee, with
their sacrifices,  
That thou hast wrecked seven autumn forts, their shelter, slain Dāsa
tribes and aided Purukutsa.  
11 Favouring Uśanā the son of Kavi, thou wast his ancient strengthener,
O Indra.  
Thou gavest Navavāstva. as a present, to the great father gavest back
his grandson.  
12 Thou, roaring Indra, drovest on the waters that made a roaring sound
like rushing rivers,  
What time, O Hero, o’er the sea thou broughtest, in safety broughtest
Turvaśa and Yadu.  
13 This Indra, was thy work in war: thou sentest Dhuni and Cumuri to
sleep and slumber.  
Dabhīti lit the flame for thee, and worshipped with fuel, hymns, poured
Soma, dressed oblations.
