### HYMN XV. Agni.

1\. To him, the far-renowned, the wise Ordainer, ancient and glorious, a
song I offer.  
Enthroned in oil, the Asura, bliss-giver, is Agni, firm support of
noble, riches.  
2 By holy Law they kept supporting Order, by help of sacrifice, in
loftiest heaven,—  
They who attained with born men to the unborn, men seated on that stay,
heaven's firm sustainer.  
3 Averting woe, they labour hard to bring him, the ancient, plenteous
food as power resistless.  
May he, born newly, conquer his assailants: round him they stand as
round an angry lion.  
4 When, like a mother, spreading forth to nourish, to cherish and regard
each man that liveth,—  
Consuming all the strength that thou hast gotten, thou wanderest round,
thyself, in varied fashion.  
5 May strength preserve the compass of thy vigour, God! that broad
stream of thine that beareth riches.  
Thou, like a thief who keeps his refuge secret, hast holpen Atri to
great wealth, by teaching.
