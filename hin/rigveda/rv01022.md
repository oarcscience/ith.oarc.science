### HYMN XXII. Aśvins and Others

1 WAKEN the Aśvin Pair who yoke their car at early morn: may they  
Approach to drink this Soma juice.  
2 We call the Aśvins Twain, the Gods borne in a noble car, the best  
Of charioteers, who reach the heavens.  
3 Dropping with honey is your whip, Aśvins, and full of pleasantness  
Sprinkle therewith the sacrifice.  
4 As ye go thither in your car, not far, O Aśvins, is the home  
Of him who offers Soma juice.  
5 For my protection I invoke the golden-handed Savitar.  
He knoweth, as a God, the place.  
6 That he may send us succour, praise the Waters’ Offspring Savitar:  
Fain are we for his holy ways.  
7 We call on him, distributer of wondrous bounty and of wealth,  
On Savitar who looks on men.  
8 Come hither, friends, and seat yourselves Savitar, to be praised by
us,  
Giving good gifts, is beautiful.  
9 O Agni, hither bring to us the willing Spouses of the Gods,  
And Tvaṣṭar, to the Soma draught.  
10 Most youthful Agni, hither bring their Spouses, Hotrā, Bhāratī,  
Varūtrī, Dhiṣaṇā, for aid.  
11 Spouses of Heroes, Goddesses, with whole wings may they come to us  
With great protection and with aid.  
12 Indrāṇī, Varuṇānī, and Agnāyī hither I invite,  
For weal, to drink the Soma juice.  
13 May Heaven and Earth, the Mighty Pair, bedew for us our sacrifice,  
And feed us full with nourishments.  
14 Their water rich with fatness, there in the Gandharva's steadfast
place,  
The singers taste through sacred songs.  
15 Thornless be thou, O Earth, spread wide before us for a
dwelling-place:  
Vouchsafe us shelter broad and sure.  
16 The Gods be gracious unto us even from the place whence Viṣṇu
strode  
Through the seven regions of the earth!  
17 Through all this world strode Viṣṇu; thrice his foot he planted, and
the whole  
Was gathered in his footstep's dust.  
18 Viṣṇu, the Guardian, he whom none deceiveth, made three steps;
thenceforth  
Establishing his high decrees.  
19 Look ye on Viṣṇu's works, whereby the Friend of Indra,
close-allied,  
Hath let his holy ways be seen.  
20 The princes evermore behold that loftiest place where Viṣṇu is,  
Laid as it were an eye in heaven.  
21 This, Viṣṇu's station most sublime, the singers, ever vigilant,  
Lovers of holy song, light up.
