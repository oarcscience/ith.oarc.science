### HYMN LXXVII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. MORE beauteous than the beautiful, as Indra's bolt, this Soma, rich
in sweets, hath clamoured in the vat.  
Dropping with oil, abundant, streams of sacrifice flow unto him like
milch-kine, lowing, with their milk.  
2 On flows that Ancient One whom, hitherward, from heaven, sped through
the region of the air, the Falcon snatched.  
He, quivering with alarm and terrified in heart before bow-armed Kṛśānu,
holdeth fast the sweet.  
3 May those first freshest drops of Soma juice effused flow on, their
way to bring us mighty strength in kine.  
Beauteous as serpents, worthy to be looked upon, they whom each sacred
gift and all our prayers have pleased.  
4 May that much-lauded Indu, with a heart inclined to us, well-knowing,
fight against our enemies.  
He who hath brought the germ beside the Strong One's seat moves onward
to the widely-opcned stall of kine.  
5 The active potent juice of heaven is flowing on, great Varuṇa whom the
forward man can ne’er deceive.  
Mitra, the Holy, hath been pressed for troubled times, neighing like an
impatient horse amid the herd,
