### HYMN CLII. Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. THE robes which ye put on abound with fatness: uninterrupted courses
are your counsels.  
All falsehood, Mitra-Varuṇa! ye conquer, and closely cleave unto the Law
Eternal.  
2 This might of theirs hath no one comprehended. True is the crushing
word the sage hath uttered,  
The fearful four-edged bolt smites down the three-edged, and those who
hate the Gods first fall and perish.  
3 The Footless Maid precedeth footed creatures. Who marketh,
Mitra-Varuṇa, this your doing?  
The Babe Unborn supporteth this world's burthen, fulfilleth Law and
overcometh falsehood.  
4 We look on him the darling of the Maidens, always advancing, never
falling downward,  
Wearing inseparable, wide-spread raiment, Mitra's and Varuṇa's
delightful glory.  
5 Unbridled Courser, born but not of horses, neighing he flieth on with
back uplifted.  
The youthful love mystery thought-surpassing, praising in Mitra-Varuṇa,
its glory.  
6 May the milch-kine who favour Māmateya prosper in this world him who
loves devotion.  
May he, well skilled in rites, be food, and calling Aditi with his lips
give us assistance.  
7 Gods, Mitra-Varuṇa, with love and worship, let me make you delight in
this oblation.  
May our prayer be victorious in battles, may we have rain from heaven to
make us prosper.
