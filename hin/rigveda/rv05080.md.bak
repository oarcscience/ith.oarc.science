### HYMN LXXX. Dawn.

1\. THE singers welcome with their hymns and praises the Goddess Dawn
who bringeth in the sunlight,  
Sublime, by Law true to eternal Order, bright on her path, red-tinted,
far-refulgent.  
2 She comes in front, fair, rousing up the people, making the pathways
easy to be travelled.  
High, on her lofty chariot, all-impelling, Dawn gives her splendour at
the days' beginning.  
3 She, harnessing her car with purple oxen. injuring none, hath brought
perpetual riches.  
Opening paths to happiness, the Goddess shines, praised by all, giver of
every blessing.  
4 With changing tints she gleams in double splendour while from the
eastward she displays her body.  
She travels perfectly the path of Order, nor fails to reach, as one who
knows, the quarters.  
5 As conscious that her limbs are bright with bathing, she stands, as
’twere, erect that we may see her.  
Driving away malignity and darkness, Dawn, Child of Heaven, hath come to
us with lustre.  
6 The Daughter of the Sky, like some chaste woman, bends, opposite to
men, her forehead downward.  
The Maid, disclosing boons to him who worships, hath brought again the
daylight as aforetime.
