### HYMN XXXII. Indra

1\. DRINK thou this Soma, Indra, Lord of Soma; drink thou the draught of
noonday which thou Iovest.  
Puffing thy cheeks, impetuous, liberal Giver, here loose thy two Bay
Horses and rejoice thee.  
2 Quaff it pure, meal-blent, mixt with milk, O Indra; we have poured
forth the Soma for thy rapture.  
Knit with the prayer-fulfilling band of Maruts, yea, with the Rudras,
drink till thou art sated;  
3 Those who gave increase to thy strength and vigour; the Maruts singing
forth thy might, O Indra.  
Drink thou, O fair of cheek, whose hand wields thunder, with Rudras
banded, at our noon libation.  
4 They, even the Maruts who were there, excited with song the
meath-created strength of Indra.  
By them impelled to act he reached the vitals Of Vṛtra, though he deemed
that none might wound him.  
5 Pleased, like a man, with our libation, Indra, drink, for enduring
hero might, the Soma.  
Lord of Bays, moved by sacrifice come hither: thou with the Swift Ones
stirrest floods and waters.  
6 When thou didst loose the streams to run like racers in the swift
contest, having smitten Vṛtra  
With flying weapon where he lay, O Indra, and, godless, kept the
Goddesses encompassed.  
7 With reverence let us worship mighty Indra, great and sublime,
eternal, everyouthful,  
Whose greatness the dear world-halves have not measured, no, nor
conceived the might of him the Holy.  
8 Many are Indra's nobly wrought achievements, and none of all the Gods
transgress his statutes.  
He beareth up this earth and heaven, and, doer of marvels, he begot the
Sun and Morning.  
9 Herein, O Guileless One, is thy true greatness, that soon as born thou
drankest up the Soma.  
Days may not check the power of thee the Mighty, nor the nights, Indra,
nor the months, nor autumns.  
10 As soon as thou wast born in highest heaven thou drankest Soma to
delight thee, Indra;  
And when thou hadst pervaded earth and heaven thou wast the first
supporter of the singer.  
11 Thou, puissant God, more mighty, slewest. Ahi showing his strength
when couched around the waters.  
The heaven itself attained not to thy greatness when with one hip of
thine the earth was shadowed.  
12 Sacrifice, Indra, made thee wax so mighty, the dear oblation with the
flowing Soma.  
O Worshipful, with worship help our worship, for worship helped thy bolt
when slaying Ahi.  
13 With sacrifice and wish have I brought Indra; still for new blessings
may I turn him hither,  
Him magnified by ancient songs and praises, by lauds of later time and
days yet recent.  
14 I have brought forth a song when longing seized me: ere the decisive
day will I laud Indra;  
Then may he safely bear us over trouble, as in a ship, when both sides
invocate him.  
15 Full is his chalice: Glory! Like a pourer I have filled up the vessel
for his drinking.  
Presented on the right, dear Soma juices have brought us Indra, to
rejoice him, hither.  
16 Not the deep-flowing flood, O Much-invoked One! not hills that
compass thee about restrain thee,  
Since here incited, for thy friends, O Indra, thou breakest e’en the
firm built stall of cattle.  
17 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in this fight where
spoil is gathered,  
The Strong who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras,
wins and gathers riches.
