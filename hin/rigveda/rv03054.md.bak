### HYMN LIV. Viśvedevas.

1\. To him adorable, mighty, meet for synods, this strengthening hymn,
unceasing, have they offered.  
May Agni hear us with his homely splendours, hear us, Eternal One, with
heavenly lustre.  
2 To mighty Heaven and Earth I sing forth loudly: my wish goes out
desirous and well knowing  
Both, at whose laud in synods, showing favour, the Gods rejoice them
with the living mortal.  
3 O Heaven and Earth, may your great law he faithful: he ye our leaders
for our high advantage.  
To Heaven and Earth I offer this my homage, with food, O Agni, as I pray
for riches.  
4 Yea, holy Heaven and Earth, the ancient sages whose word was ever true
had power to find you;  
And brave men in the fightwhere heroes conquer, O Earth, have known you
well and paid you honour.  
5 What pathway leadeth to the Gods? Who knoweth this of a truth, and who
will now declare it?  
Seen are their lowest dwelling-places only, but they are in remote and
secret regions.  
6 The Sage who looketh on mankind hath viewed them bedewed, rejoicing in
the seat of Order.  
They make a home as for a bird, though parted, with one same will
finding themselves together.  
7 Partners though parted, with far-distant limits, on one firm place
both stand for ever watchful,  
And, being young for evermore, as sisters, speak to each other names
that are united.  
8 All living things they part and keep asunder; though bearing up the
mighty Gods they reel not.  
One All is Lord of what is fixed and moving, that walks, that flies,
this multiform creation.  
9 Afar the Ancient from of old I ponder, our kinship with our mighty
Sire and Father,—  
Singing the praise whereof the Gods by custom stand on the spacious
far-extended pathway.  
10 This laud, O Heaven and Earth, to you I utter: let the kind-hearted
hear, whose tongue is Agni,  
Young, Sovran Rulers, Varuṇa and Mitra, the wise and very glorious
Ādityas.  
11 The fair-tongued Savitar, the golden-handed, comes thrice from heaven
as Lord in our assembly.  
Bear to the Gods this song of praise, and send us, then, Savitar,
complete and perfect safety.  
12 Deft worker, skiful-handed, helpful, holy, may Tvaṣṭar, God, give us
these things to aid us,  
Take your delight, Ye Ṛbhus joined with Pūṣan: ye have prepared the rite
with stones adjusted.  
13 Borne on their flashing car, the spear-armed Maruts, the nimble
Youths of Heaven, the Sons of Order,  
The Holy, and Sarasvatī, shall hear us: ye Mighty, give us wealth with
noble offspring.  
14 To Viṣṇu rich in marvels, songs And praises shall go as singers on
the road of Bhaga,—  
The Chieftain of the Mighty Stride, whose Mothers, the many young Dames,
never disregard him.  
15 Indra, who rules through all his powers heroic, hath with his majesty
filled earth and heaven.  
Lord of brave hosts, Fort-crusher, Vṛtra-slayer, gather thou up and
bring us store of cattle.  
16 My Sires are the Nāsatyas, kind tokinsmen: the Aśvins' kinship is a
glorious title.  
For ye are they who give us store of riches: ye guard your gift
uncheated by the bounteous.  
17 This is, ye Wise, your great and glorious title, that all ye Deities
abide in Indra.  
Friend, Much-invoked! art thou with thy dear Ṛbhus: fashion ye this our
hymn for our advantage.  
18 Aryaman, Aditi deserve our worship: the laws of Varuṇa remain
unbroken.  
The lot of childlessness remove ye from us, and let our course be rich
in kine and offspring.  
19 May the Gods’ envoy, sent to many a quarter, proclaim us sinless for
our perfect safety.  
May Earth and Heaven, the Sun, the waters, hear us, and the wide
firmament and constellations.  
20 Hear us the mouatains which distil the rain-drops, and, resting firm,
rejoice in freshening moisture.  
May Aditi with the Ādityas hear us, and Maruts grant us their auspicious
shelter.  
21 Soft be our path for ever, well-provisioned: with pleasant meath, O
Gods, the herbs besprinkle.  
Safe be my bliss, O Agni, in thy friendship: may I attain the seat of
foodful. riches,  
22 Enjoy the offering: beam thou strength upon us; combine thou for our
good all kinds of glory.  
Conquer in battle, Agni, all those foemen, and light us every day with
loving kindness.
