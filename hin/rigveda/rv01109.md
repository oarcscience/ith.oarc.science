### HYMN CIX. Indra-Agni.

1\. LONGING for weal I looked around, in spirit, for kinsmen,
Indra-Agni, or for brothers.  
No providence but yours alone is with me so have I wrought for you this
hymn for succour.  
2 For I have heard that ye give wealth more freely than worthless
son-in-law or spouse's brother.  
So offering to you this draught of Soma, I make you this new hymn, Indra
and Agni,  
3 Let us not break the cords: with this petition we strive to gain the
powers of our forefathers.  
For Indra-Agni the strong drops are joyful, for here in the bowl's lap
are both the press-stones.  
4 For you the bowl divine, Indra and Agni, presses the Soma gladly to
delight you.  
With hands auspicious and fair arms, ye Aśvins, haste, sprinkle it with
sweetness in the waters.  
5 You, I have heard, were mightiest, Indra-Agni, when Vṛtra fell and
when the spoil was parted.  
Sit at this sacrifice, ye ever active, on the strewn grass, and with the
juice delight you.  
6 Surpassing all men where they shout for battle, ye Twain exceed the
earth and heaven in greatness.  
Greater are ye than rivers and than mountains, O Indra-Agni, and all
things beside them.  
7 Bring wealth and give it, ye whose arms wield thunder: Indra and Agni,
with your powers protect us.  
Now of a truth these be the very sunbeams wherewith our fathers were of
old united.  
8 Give, ye who shatter forts, whose hands wield thunder: Indra and Agni,
save us in our battles.  
This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu,
Earth and Heaven.
