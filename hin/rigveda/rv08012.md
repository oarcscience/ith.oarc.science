### HYMN XII. Indra.

1\. JOY, Mightiest Indra, known and marked, sprung most from
Soma-draughts, wherewith  
Thou smitest down the greedy fiend, for that we long.  
2 Wherewith thou bolpest Adhrigu, the great Daśagva, and the God  
Who stirs the sunlight, and the sea, for that we long.  
3 Wherewith thou dravest forth like cars Sindhu and all the mighty
floods  
To go the way ordained by Law, for that we long.  
4 Accept this laud for aid, made pure like oil, thou Caster of the
Stone,  
Whereby even in a moment thou hast waxen great.  
5 Be pleased, Song-lover, with this song it flows abundant like the
sea.  
Indra, with all thy succours thou hast waxen great.  
6 The God who from afar hath sent gifts to maintain our friendship's
bond,  
Thou. spreading them like rain from heaven, hast waxen great.  
7 The beams that mark him have grown strong, the thunder rests between
his arms,  
When, like the Sun, he hath increased both Heaven and Earth.  
8 When, Mighty Lord of Heroes, thou didst cat a thousand buffaloes,  
Then grew and waxed exceeding great thine Indra-power.  
9 Indra consumeth with the rays of Sūrya the malicious man:  
Like Agni conquering the woods, he hath grown strong.  
10 This newest thought of ours that suits the time approaches unto
thee:  
Serving, beloved in many a place it metes and marks.  
11 The pious germ of sacrifice directly purifies the soul.  
By Indra's lauds it waxes great, it metes and marks.  
12 Indra who wins the friend hath spread himself to drink the
Soma-draught:  
Like worshipper's dilating praise; it metes and marks.  
13 He whom the sages, living men, have gladdened, offering up their
hymns,  
Hath swelled like oil of sacrifice in Agni's mouth.  
14 Aditi also hath brought forth a hymn for Indra, Sovran Lord:  
The work of sacrifice for help is glorified.  
15 The ministering priests have sung their songs for aid and eulogy:  
God, thy Bays turn not from the rite which Law ordains.  
16 If, Indra, thou drink Soma by Viṣṇu's or Tṛta Āptya's side,  
Or with the Maruts take delight in flowing drops;  
17 Or, Śakra, if thou gladden thee afar or in the sea of air,  
Rejoice thee in this juice of ours, in flowing drops.  
18 Or, Lord of Heroes if thou aid the worshipper who shed; the, juice,  
Or him whose laud delights thee, and his flowing drops.  
19 To magnify the God, the God, Indra, yea, Indra for your help,  
And promptly end the sacrifice-this have they gained.  
20 With worship, him whom men adore, with Soma, him who drinks it
most,  
Indra with lauds have they increasedthis have they gained.  
21 His leadings are with power and might and his instructions
manifold:  
He gives the worshipper all wealth: this have they gained.  
22 For slaying Vṛtra have the Gods set Indra in the foremost place.  
Indra the choral bands have sung, for vigorous strength.  
23 We to the Mighty with our might, with lauds to him who hears our
call,  
With holy hymns have sung aloud, for vigorous strength.  
24 Not earth, nor heaven, nor firmaments contain the Thunder-wielding
God:  
They shake before his violent rush and vigorous strength.  
25 What time the Gods, O Indra, get thee foremost in the furious
fight,  
Then thy two beautiful Bay Steeds carried thee on.  
26 When Vṛtra, stayer of the floods, thou si"est, Thundeicr with
might,  
Then thy two beautiful Bay Steeds carried thee on.  
27 When Viṣṇu, through thine energy, strode wide those three great steps
of his,  
Then thy two beautiful Bay Steeds carried thee on.  
28 When thy two beautiful Bay Steeds grew great and greater day by
day,  
Even then all creatures that had life bowed down to thee.  
29 When, Indra, all the Marut folk humbly submitted them to thee,  
Even then all creatures that had life bowed down to thee.  
30 When yonder Sun, that brilliant light, thou settest in the heaven
above,  
Even then all creatures that had life bowed down to thee.  
31 To thee, O Indra, with this thought the sage lifts up this eulogy,  
Akin and leading as on foot to sacrifice.  
32 When in thine own dear dwelling all gathered have lifted up the
voice  
Milk-streams at worship's central spot, for sacrifice,  
33 As Priest, O Indra, give us wealth in brave men and good steeds ana
kine  
That we may first remember thee for sacrifice.
