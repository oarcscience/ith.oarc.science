### HYMN LXII. Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. SURYA hath sent aloft his beams of splendour o’er all the tribes of
men in countless places.  
Together with the heaven he shines apparent, formed by his Makers well
with power and wisdom.  
2 So hast thou mounted up before us, Sūrya, through these our praises,
with fleet dappled horses.  
Declare us free from all offence to Mitra, and Varuṇa, and Aryaman, and
Agni.  
3 May holy Agni, Varuṇa, and Mitra send down their riches upon us in
thousands.  
May they, the Bright Ones, make our praise-song perfect, and, when we
laud them, grant us all our wishes.  
4 O undivided Heaven and Earth, preserve us, us, Lofty Ones! your
nobIy-born descendants.  
Let us not anger Varuṇa, nor Vāyu, nor him, the dearest Friend of
mortals, Mitra.  
5 Stretch forth your arms and let our lives be lengthened: with fatness
dew the pastures of our cattle.  
Ye Youthful, make us famed among the people: hear, Mitra-Varuṇa, these
mine invocations.  
6 Now Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman vouchsafe us freedom and room, for us and
for our children.  
May we find paths all fair and good to travel. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
