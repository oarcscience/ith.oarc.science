### HYMN XXVI. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THE sages with the fingers' art have dressed and decked that
vigorous Steed  
Upon the lap of Aditi,  
2 The kine have called aloud to him exhaustless with a thousand
streams,  
To Indu who supporteth heaven.  
3 Him, nourisher of many, Sage, creative Pavamana, they  
Have sent, by wisdom, to the sky.  
4 Him, dweller with Vivasvān, they with use of both arms have sent
forth,  
The Lord of Speech infallible.  
5 Him, green, beloved, many eyed, the Sisters with prosing stones  
Send down to ridges of the sieve.  
6 O Pavamana, Indu, priests hurry thee on to Indra, thee  
Who aidest song and cheerest him.
