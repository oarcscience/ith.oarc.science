### HYMN CLVII. Aśvins.

1\. AGNI is wakened: Sūrya riseth from the earth. Mighty, refulgent Dawn
hath shone with all her light.  
The Aśvins have equipped their chariot for the course. God Savitar hath
moved the folk in sundry ways.  
2 When, Aśvins, ye equip your very mighty car, bedew, ye Twain, our
power with honey and with oil.  
To our devotion give victorious strength in war: may we win riches in
the heroes' strife for spoil.  
3 Nigh to us come the Aśvins' lauded three-wheeled car, the car laden
with meath and drawn by fleet-foot steeds,  
Three-seated, opulent, bestowing all delight. may it bring weal to us,
to cattle and to men.  
4 Bring hither nourishment for us, ye Aśvins Twain; sprinkle us with
your whip that drops with honey-dew.  
Prolong our days of life, wipe out our trespasses; destroy our foes, be
our companions and our Friends.  
5 Ye store the germ of life in female creatures, ye lay it up within all
living beings.  
Ye have sent forth, O Aśvins passing mighty, the fire, the sovrans of
the wood, the waters,  
6 Leeches are ye with medicines to heal us, and charioteers are ye with
skill in driving.  
Ye Strong, give sway to him who brings oblation and with his heart pours
out his gift before you.
