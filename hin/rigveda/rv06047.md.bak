### HYMN XLVII. Indra, Etc.

1\. YEA, this is good to taste and full of. sweetness, verily it is
strong and rich in flavour.  
No one may conquer Indra in the battle when he hath drunken of the
draught we offer.  
2 This sweet juice here had mightiest power to gladden: it boldened
Indra when he siaughtered Vṛtra,  
When he defeated Śambara's many onslaughts, and battered down his
nineand ninety ramparts.  
3 This stirreth up my voice when I have drunk it: this hath aroused from
sleep my yearning spirit.  
This Sage hath measured out the six expanses from which no single
creature is excluded.  
4 This, even this, is he who hath created the breadth of earth, the
lofty height of heaven.  
He formed the nectar in three headlong rivers. Soma supports the wide
mid-air above us.  
5 He found the wavy sea of brilliant colours in forefront of the Dawns
who dwell in brightness.  
This Mighty One, the Steer begirt by Maruts, hath propped the heavens up
with a mighty pillar.  
6 Drink Soma boldly from the beaker, Indra, in war for treasures, Hero,
Vṛtra-slayer!  
Fill thyself full at the mid-day libation, and give us wealth, thou
Treasury of riches.  
7 Look out for us, O Indra, as our Leader, and guide us on to gain yet
goodlier treasure.  
Excellent Guardian, bear us well through peril, and lead us on to wealth
with careful guidance.  
8 Lead us to ample room, O thou who knowest, to happiness, security, and
sunlight.  
High, Indra, are the arms of thee the Mighty: may we betake. us to their
lofty shelter.  
9 Set us on widest chariot-seat, O Indra, with two steeds best to draw,
O Lord of Hundreds!  
Bring us the best among all sorts of viands: let not the foe's wealth,
Maghavan, subdue us.  
10 Be gracious, Indra, let my days be lengthened: sharpen my thought as
’twere a blade of iron  
Approve whatever words I speak, dependent on thee, and grant me thy
divine protection.  
11 Indra the Rescuer, Indra the Helper, Hero who listens at each
invocation,  
Śakra I call, Indra invoked of many. May Indra Maghavan prosper and
bless us.  
12 May helpful Indra as our good Protector, Lord of all treasures,
favour us with succour,  
Baffle our foes, and give us rest and safety, and may we be the lords of
hero vigour.  
13 May we enjoy the grace of him the Holy, yea, may we dwell in his
auspicious favour.  
May helpful Indra as our good Preserver drive from us, even from afar,
our foemen.  
14 Like rivers rushing down a slope, O Indra, to thee haste songs and
prayers and linked verses.  
Thou gatherest, Thunderer! like widespread bounty, kine, water, drops,
and manifold libations.  
15 Who lauds him, satisfies him, pays him worship? E’en the rich noble
still hath found him mighty.  
With power, as when one moves his feet alternate, he makes the last
precede, the foremost follow.  
16 Famed is the Hero as each strong man's tamer, ever advancing one and
then another.  
King of both worlds, hating the high and haughty, Indra protects the men
who are his people.  
17 He loves no more the men he loved aforetime: he turns and moves away
allied with others.  
Rejecting those who disregard his worship, Indra victorious lives
through many autumns.  
18 In every figure he hath been the mode: this is his only form for us
to look on.  
Indra moves multiform by his illusions; for his Bay Steeds are yoked,
ten times a hundred.  
19 Here Tvaṣṭar, yoking to the car the Bay Steeds, hath extended sway.  
Who will for ever stand upon the foeman's side, even when our princes
sit at ease?  
20 Gods, we have reached a country void of pasture the land, though
spacious, was too small to hold us.  
Bṛhaspati, provide in war for cattle; find a path, Indra, for this
faithful singer.  
21 Day after day far from their seat he drove them, alike, from place to
place, those darksome creatures.  
The Hero slew the meanly-huckstering Dāsas, Varcin and Śambara, where
the waters gather.  
22 Out of thy bounty, Indra, hath Prastoka bestowed ten coffers and ten
mettled horses.  
We have received in turn from Divodāsa Śambara's wealth, the gift of
Atithigva.  
23 Ten horses and ten treasure-chests, ten garments as an added gift,  
These and ten lumps of gold have I received from Divodāsa's hand.  
24 Ten cars with extra steed to each, for the Atharvans hundred cows,  
Hath Asvatha to Payu given.  
25 Thus Sṛñjaya's son honoured the Bharadvājas, recipients of all noble
gifts and bounty.  
26 Lord of the wood, be firm and strong in body: be, bearing us, a brave
victorious hero  
Show forth thy strength, compact with straps of leather, and let thy
rider win all spoils of battle.  
27 Its mighty strength was borrowed from the heaven and earth: its
conquering force was brought from sovrans of the wood.  
Honour with holy gifts the Car like Indra's bolt, the Car bound round
with straps, the vigour of the floods.  
28 Thou Bolt of Indra, Vanguard of the Maruts, close knit to Varuṇa and
Child of Mitra,—  
As such, accepting gifts which here we offer, receive, O Godlike
Chariot, these oblations.  
29 Send forth thy voice aloud through earth and heaven, and let the
world in all its breadth regard thee;  
O Drum, accordant with the Gods and Indra, drive thou afar, yea, very
far, our foemen.  
30 Thunder out strength and fill us full of vigour: yea, thunder forth
and drive away all dangers.  
Drive hence, O War-drum, drive away misfortune: thou art the Fist of
Indra: show thy firmness.  
31 Drive hither those, and these again bring hither: the War-drum speaks
aloud as battle's signal.  
Our heroes, winged with horses, come together. Let our car-warriors,
Indra, be triumphant.
