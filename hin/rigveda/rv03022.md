### HYMN XXII. Agni.

1 THIS is that Agni whence the longing Indra took the pressed Soma deep
within his body.  
Winner of spoils in thousands, like a courser, with praise art thou
exalted, Jātavedas.  
2 That light of thine in heaven and earth, O Agni, in plants, O Holy
One, and in the waters,  
Wherewith thou hast spread wide the air's mid-region-bright is that
splendour, wavy, man-beholding.  
3 O Agni, to the sea of heaven thou goest: thou hast called hither Gods
beheld in spirit.  
The waters, too, come hither, those up yonder in the Sun's realm of
light, and those beneath it.  
4 Let fires that dwell in mist, combined with those that have their home
in floods,  
Guileless accept our sacrifice, great viands free from all disease.  
5 Agni, as holy food to thine invoker give wealth in cattle, lasting,
rich in marvels.  
To us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious
will to us-ward.
