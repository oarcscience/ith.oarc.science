### HYMN LXXXII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. EVEN as a King hath Soma, red and tawny Bull, been pressed: the
Wondrous One hath bellowed to the kine.  
While purified he passes through the filtering fleece to seat him
hawk-like on the place that drops with oil.  
2. To glory goest thou, Sage with disposing skill, like a groomed steed
thou rusbest forward to the prize.  
O Soma, be thou gracious, driving off distress: thou goest, clothed in
butter, to a robe of state.  
3 Parjanya is the Father of the Mighty Bird: on mountains, in earth's
centre hath he made his home.  
The waters too have flowed, the Sisters, to the kine: he meets the
pressing-stones at the beloved rite.  
4 Thou givest pleasure as a wife delights her lord. Listen, O Child of
Pajri, for to thee I speak.  
Amid the holy songs go on that we may live: in time of trouble, Soma,
watch thou free from blame.  
5 As to the men of old thou camest, Indu unharmed, to strengthen,
winning hundreds, thousands,  
So now for new felicity flow onward: the waters follow as thy law
ordaineth.
