### HYMN CXXXI. Indra.

1\. To Indra Dyaus the Asura hath bowed him down, to Indra mighty Earth
with wide-extending tracts, to win the light, with wide-spread tracts.  
All Gods of one accord have set Indra in front preeminent.  
For Indra all libations must be set apart, all man's libations set
apart.  
2 In all libations men with hero spirit urge the Universal One, each
seeking several light, each fain to win the light apart.  
Thee, furthering like a ship, will we set to the chariot-pole of
strength,  
As men who win with sacrifices Indra's thought, men who win Indra with
their lauds.  
3 Couples desirous of thine aid are storming thee, pouring their
presents forth to win a stall of kine, pouring gifts, Indra, seeking
thee.  
When two men seeking spoil or heaven thou bringest face to face in
war,  
Thou showest, Indra, then the bolt thy constant friend, the Bull that
ever waits on thee.  
4 This thine heroic power men of old time have known, wherewith thou
breakest down, Indra, autumnal forts, breakest them down with conquering
might.  
Thou hast chastised, O Indra, Lord of Strength, the man who worships
not,  
And made thine own this great earth and these water-floods; with joyous
heart these [water-floods](errata.htm#4.md).  
5 And they have bruited far this hero-might when thou, O Strong One, in
thy joy helpest thy suppliants, who sought to win thee for their
Friend.  
Their battle-cry thou madest sound victorious in the shocks of war.  
One stream after another have they gained from thee, eager for glory
have they gained.  
6. Also this morn may he be well inclined to us, mark at our call our
offerings and our song of praise, our call that we may win the light.  
As thou, O Indra Thunder-armed, wilt, as the Strong One, slay the foe,  
Listen thou to the prayer of me a later sage, hear thou a later sage's
prayer.  
7 O Indra, waxen strong and well-inclined to us, thou very mighty, slay
the man that is our foe, slay the man, Hero! with thy bolt.  
Slay thou the man who injures us: hear thou, as readiest, to hear.  
Far be malignity, like mischief on the march, afar be all malignity.
