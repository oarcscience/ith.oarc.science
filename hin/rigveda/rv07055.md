### HYMN LV. Vastospati.

1\. VASTOSPATI, who killest all disease and wearest every form,  
Be an auspicious Friend to us.  
2 When, O bright Son of Saramā, thou showest, tawny-hued! thy teeth,  
They gleam like lances' points within thy mouth when thou wouldst bite;
go thou to steep.  
3 Saramā's Son, retrace thy way: bark at the robber and the thief.  
At Indra's singers barkest thou? Why dust thou seek to terrify us? Go to
sleep.  
4 Be on thy guard against the boar, and let the boar beware of thee.  
At Indra's singers barkest thou? Why dost thou seek to terrify us? Go to
sleep.  
5 Sleep mother, let the father sleep, sleep dog and master of the
house.  
Let all the kinsmen sleep, sleep all the people who are round about.  
6 The man who sits, the man who walks, and whosoever looks on us,  
Of these we closely shut the eyes, even as we closely shut this house.  
7 The Bull who hath a thousand horns, who rises up from out the sea,—  
By him the Strong and Mighty One we lull and make the people sleep.  
8 The women sleeping in the court, lying without, or stretched on
beds,  
The matrons with their odorous sweetsthese, one and all, we lull to
sleep.
