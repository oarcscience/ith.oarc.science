### HYMN V. Agni.

1\. HERALD and teacher was he born, a guardian for our patrons’ help,  
Earner by rites of noble wealth. That Strong One may we grasp and
guide;  
2 In whom, Leader of sacrifice, the seven reins, far extended, meet;  
Who furthers, man-like, eighth in place, as Cleanser, all the work
divine.  
3 When swift he follows this behest, bird-like he chants the holy
prayers.  
He holds all knowledge in his grasp even as the felly rounds the
wheel.  
4 Together with pure mental power, pure, as Director, was he born.  
Skilled in his own unchanging laws he waxes like the growing boughs.  
5 Clothing them in his hues, the kine of him the Leader wait on him.  
Is he not better than the Three, the Sisters who have come to us?  
6 When, laden with the holy oil, the [Sister](errata.htm#10.md) by the
Mother stands,  
The Priest delights in their approach, as corn at coming of the rain.  
7 For his support let him perform as ministrant his priestly task;  
Yea, song of praise and sacrifice: we have bestowed, let us obtain.  
8 That so this man well skilled, may pay worship to all the Holy Ones.  
And, Agni, this our sacrifice which we have here prepared, to thee.
