### HYMN CXTII. Indra.

1\. THE Heavens and the Earth accordant with all Gods encouraged
graciously that vigorous might of his.  
When he came showing forth his majesty and power, he drank of Soma juice
and waxed exceeding strong.  
2 This majesty of his Viṣṇu extols and lauds, making the stalCthat gives
the meath flow forth with inight.  
When Indra Maghavan with those who followed him had smitten Vṛtra he
deserved the choice of Gods.  
3 When, bearing warlike weapons, fain to win thee praise, thou mettest
Vṛtra, yea, the Dragon, for the fight,  
Then all the Maruts who were gathered with dice there extolled, O Mighty
One, thy powerful majesty.  
4 Soon as he sprang to life he forced asun. der hosts: forward the Hero
looked to manly deed and war.  
He cleft the rock, he let concurrent streams flow forth, and with his
skilful art stablished the heavens' wide vault.  
5 Indra hath evermore possessed surpassing power: he forced, far from
each other, heaven and earth apart.  
He hurled impetuous down his iron thunderbolt, a joy to Varuṇa's and
Mitra's worshipper.  
6 Then to the mighty powers of Indra, to his wrath, his the fierce
Stormer, loud of voice, they came with speed;  
What time the Potent One rent Vṛtra with his strength, who held the
waters back, whom darkness compassed round.  
7 Even in the first of those heroic acts which they who strove together
came with might to execute,  
Deep darkness fell upon the slain, and Indra won by victory the right of
being first invoked.  
8 Then all the Gods extolled, with eloquence inspired by draughts of
Soma juice, thy deeds of manly might.  
As Agni eats the dry food with his tcetlv, he ate Vṛtra, the Dragon,
maimed by Indra's deadly dart.  
9 Proclaim his many friendships, met with friendship, made with singers,
with the skilful and the eloquent.  
Indra, when he subdues Dhuni and Cumuri, lists to Dabhīti for his
faithful spirit's sake.  
10 Give riches manifold with noble horses, to be remembered while my
songs address thee.  
May we by easy paths pass all our troubles: find us this day a ford wide
and extensive.
