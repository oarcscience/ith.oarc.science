### HYMN LI. Viśvedevas.

1\. THAT mighty eye of Varuṇa and Mitra, infallible and dear, is moving
upward.  
The pure and lovely face of holy Order hath shone like gold of heaven in
its arising.  
2 The Sage who knows these Gods’ three ranks and orders, and all their
generations near and distant,  
Beholding good and evil acts of mortals, Sūra marks well the doing of
the pious.  
3 I praise you Guards of mighty Law eternal, Aditi, Mitra, Varuṇa, the
noble,  
Aryaman, Bhaga, all whose thoughts are faithful: hither I call the
Bright who share in common.  
4 Lords of the brave, infallible, foe-destroyers, great Kings, bestowers
of fair homes to dwell in,  
Young, Heroes, ruling heaven with strong dominion, Ādityas, Aditi I seek
with worship.  
5 O Heaven our Father, Earth our guileless Mother, O Brother Agni, and
ye Vasus, bless us.  
Grant us, O Aditi and ye Ādityas, all of one mind, your manifold
protection.  
6 Give us not up to any evil creature, as spoil to wolf or she-wolf, O
ye Holy.  
For ye are they who guide aright our bodies, ye are the rulers of our
speech and vigour.  
7 Let us not suffer for the sin of others, nor do the deed which ye, O
Vasus, punish.  
Ye, Universal Gods! are all-controllers: may he do harm unto himself who
hates Me.  
8 Mighty is homage: I adopt and use it. Homage hath held in place the
earth and heaven.  
Homage to Gods! Homage commands and rules them. I banish even committed
sin by homage  
9 You Furtherers of Law, pure in your spirit, infallible, dwellers in
the home of Order,  
To you all Heroes mighty and far-seeing I bow me down, O Holy Ones, with
homage.  
10 For these are they who shine with noblest splendour; through all our
troubles these conduct us safely-  
Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni, mighty Rulers, trueminded, faithful to the hymn's
controllers.  
11 May they, Earth, Aditi, Indra, Bhaga, Pūṣan increase our laud,
increase the Fivefold people.  
Giving good help, good refuge, goodly guidance, be they our good
deliverers, good protectors.  
12 Come now, O Gods, to your celestial station: the Bharadvājas' priest
entreats your favour.  
He, sacrificing, fain for wealth, hath honoured the Gods vath those who
sit and share oblations.  
13 Agni, drive thou the wicked foe, the evil-hearted thief away,  
Far, far, Lord of the brave I and give us easy paths.  
14 Soma, these pressing-stones have called aloud to win thee for our
Friend.  
Destroy the greedy Paṇi, for a wolf is he.  
15 Ye, O most bountiful, are they who, led by Indra, seek the sky.  
Give us good paths for travel: guard us ivell at home.  
16 Now have we entered on the road that leads to bliss, without a foe,  
The road whereon a man escapes all enemies and gathers wealth.
