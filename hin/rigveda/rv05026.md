### HYMN XXVI. Agni.

1\. O AGNI, Holy and Divine, with splendour and thy pleasant tongue  
Bring hither and adore the Gods.  
2 We pray thee, thou who droppest oil, bright-rayed! who lookest on the
Sun,  
Bring the Gods hither to the feast.  
3 We have enkindled thee, O Sage, bright caller of the Gods to feast.  
O Agni, great in Sacrifice.  
4 O Agni, come with all the Gods, come to our sacrificial gift:  
We choose thee as Invoking Priest.  
5 Bring, Agni, to the worshipper who pours the juice, heroic strength:  
Sit with the Gods upon the grass.  
6 Victor of thousands, Agni, thou, enkindled, cherishest the laws,  
Laud-worthy, envoy of the Gods.  
7 Set Agni Jātavedas down, the bearer of our sacred gifts,  
MostYouthful, God and Minister.  
8 Duly proceed our sacrifice, comprising all the Gods, to-day:  
Strew holy grass to be their seat.  
9 So may the Maruts sit thereon, the Aśvins, Mitra, Varuṇa:  
The Gods with all their company.
