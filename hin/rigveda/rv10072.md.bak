### HYMN LXXII. The Gods.

1\. LET US with tuneful skill proclaim these generations of the Gods,  
That one may see them when these hymns are chanted in a future age.  
2 These Brahmaṇaspati produced with blast and smelting, like a Smith,  
Existence, in an earlier age of Gods, from Non-existence sprang.  
3 Existence, in the earliest age of Gods, from Non-existence sprang.  
Thereafter were the regions born. This sprang from the Productive
Power.  
4 Earth sprang from the Productive Power the regions from the earth were
born.  
Dakṣa was born of Aditi, and Aditi was Dakṣa's Child.  
5 For Aditi, O Dakṣa, she who is thy Daughter, was brought forth.  
After her were the blessed Gods born sharers of immortal life.  
6 When ye, O Gods, in yonder deep closeclasping one another stood,  
Thence, as of dancers, from your feet a thickening cloud of dust
arose.  
7 When, O ye Gods, like Yatis, ye caused all existing things to grow,  
Then ye brought Sūrya forward who was lying hidden in the sea.  
8 Eight are the Sons of Adid who from her body sprang to life.  
With seven she went to meet the Gods she cast Martanda far away.  
9 So with her Seven Sons Aditi went forth to meet the earlier age.  
She brought Martanda thitherward to spring to life and die again.
