### HYMN CXVII. Aśvins.

1\. AŚVINS, your ancient priest invites you hither to gladden you with
draughts of meath of Soma.  
Our gift is on the grass, our song apportioned: with food and strength
come hither, O Nāsatyas.  
2 That car of yours, swifter than thought, O Aśvins, which drawn by
brave steeds cometh to the people,  
Whereon ye seek the dwelling of the pious,—come ye thereon to our abode,
O Heroes.  
3 Ye freed sage Atri, whom the Five Tribes honoured, from the strait
pit, ye Heroes with his people,  
Baffling the guiles of the malignant Dasyu, repelling them, ye Mighty in
succession.  
4 Rebha the sage, ye mighty Heroes, Aśvins! whom, like a horse, vile men
had sunk in water,—  
Him, wounded, with your wondrous power ye rescued: your exploits of old
time endure for ever.  
5 Ye brought forth Vandana, ye Wonder-Workers, for triumph, like fair
gold that hath been buried,  
Like one who slumbered in destruction's bosom, or like the Sun when
dwelling in the darkness.  
6 Kakṣīvān, Pajra's son, must laud that exploit of yours, Nāsatyas,
Heroes, ye who wander!  
When from the hoof of your strong horse ye showered a hundred jars of
honey for the people.  
7 To Kṛṣṇa's son, to Viśvaka who praised you, O Heroes, ye restored his
son Viṣṇāpū.  
To Ghoṣā, living in her father's dwelling, stricken in years, ye gave a
husband, Aśvins.  
8 Ruṣatī, of the mighty people, Aśvins, ye gave to Śyāva of the line of
Kaṇva.  
This deed of yours, ye Strong Ones should be published, that ye gave
glory to the son of Nṛṣad.  
9 O Aśvins, wearing many forms at pleasure, on Pedu ye bestowed a
fleet-foot courser,  
Strong, winner of a thousand spoils, resistless the serpent slayer,
glorious, triumphant.  
10 These glorious things are yours, ye Bounteous Givers; prayer, praise
in both worlds are your habitation.  
O Aśvins, when the sons of Pajra call you, send strength with
nourishment to him who knoweth.  
11 Hymned with the reverence of a son, O Aśvins ye Swift Ones giving
booty to the singer,  
Glorified by Agastya with devotion, established Viśpalā again,
Nāsatyas.  
12 Ye Sons of Heaven, ye Mighty, whither went ye, sought ye, for his
fair praise the home of Kāvya.  
When, like a pitcher full of gold, O Aśvins, on the tenth day ye lifted
up the buried?  
13 Ye with the aid of your great powers, O Aśvins, restored to youth the
ancient man Cyavāna.  
The Daughter of the Sun with all her glory, O ye Nāsatyas, chose your
car to bear her.  
14 Ye, ever-youthful Ones, again remembered Tugra, according to your
ancient manner:  
With horses brown of hue that flew with swift wings ye brought back
Bhujyu from the sea of billows.  
15 The son of Tugra had invoked you, Aśvins; borne on he went uninjured
through the ocean.  
Ye with your chariot swift as thought, well-harnessed, carried him off,
O Mighty Ones, to safety.  
16 The quail had invocated you, O Aśvins, when from the wolf's devouring
jaws ye freed her.  
With conquering car ye cleft the mountain's ridges: the offspring of
Viśvāc ye killed with poison.  
17 He whom for furnishing a hundred wethers to the she-wolf, his wicked
father blinded,—  
To him, Ṛjrāśva, gave ye eyes, O Aśvins; light to the blind ye sent for
perfect vision.  
18 To bring the blind man joy thus cried the she-wolf: O Aśvins, O ye
Mighty Ones, O Heroes,  
For me Ṛjrāśva, like a youthful lover, hath. cut piecemeal one and a
hundred wethers.  
19 Great and weal-giving is your aid, O Aśvins, ye, objects of all
thought, made whole the cripple.  
Purandhi also for this cause invoked you, and ye, O mighty, came to her
with succours.  
20 Ye, Wonder-Workers, filled with milk for Śayu the milkless cow,
emaciated, barren;  
And by your powers the child of Purumitra ye brought to Vimada to be his
consort.  
21 Ploughing and sowing barley, O ye Aśvins, milking out food for men,
ye Wonder-Workers,  
Blasting away the Dasyu with your trumpet, ye gave far-spreading light
unto the Ārya.  
22 Ye brought the horse's head, Aśvins, and gave it unto Dadhyac the
offspring of Atharvan.  
True, he revealed to you, O Wonder-Workers, sweet Soma, Tvaṣṭar's
secret, as your girdle.  
23 O Sages, evermore I crave your favour: be gracious unto all my
prayers, O Aśvins.  
Grant me, Nāsatyas, riches in abundance, wealth famous and accompanied
with children.  
24 With liberal bounty to the weakling's consorts ye, Heroes, gave a son
Hiraṇyahasta;  
And Śyāva, cut into three several pieces, ye brought to life again, O
bounteous Aśvins.  
25 These your heroic exploits, O ye Aśvins, done in the days. of old,
have men related.  
May we, addressing prayer to you, ye Mighty, speak with brave sons about
us to the synod.
