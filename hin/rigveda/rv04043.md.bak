### HYMN XLIII. Aśvins.

1\. WHO will hear, who of those who merit worship, which of all Gods
take pleasure in our homage?  
On whose heart shall we lay this laud celestial, rich with fair
offerings, dearest to Immortals?  
2 Who will be gracious? Who will come most quickly of all the Gods? Who
will  
bring bliss most largely?  
What car do they call swift with rapid coursers? That which the Daughter
of the Sun elected.  
3 So many days do ye come swiftly hither, as Indra to give help in
stress of battle.  
Descended from the sky, divine, strong-pinioned, by which of all your
powers are ye most mighty?  
4 What is the prayer that we should bring you, Aśvins, whereby ye come
to us when invocated?  
Whether of you confronts e’en great betrayal? Lovers of sweetness,
Dasras, help and save us.  
5 In the wide space your chariot reacheth heaven, what time it turneth
hither from the ocean.  
Sweets from your sweet shall drop, lovers of sweetness! These have they
dressed for you as dainty viands.  
6 Let Sindhu with his wave bedew your horses: in fiery glow have the red
birds come hither.  
Observed of all was that your rapid going, whereby ye were the Lords of
Sūrya's Daughter.  
7 Whene’er I gratified you here together, your grace was given us, O ye
rich in booty.  
Protect, ye Twain, the singer of your praises: to you, Nāsatyas, is my
wish directed.
