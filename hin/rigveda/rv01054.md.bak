### HYMN LIV. Indra.

1 URGE us not, Maghavan, to this distressful fight, for none may
comprehend the limit of thy strength.  
Thou with fierce shout hast made the woods and rivers roar: did not men
run in crowds together in their fear?  
2 Sing hymns of praise to Śakra, Lord of power and might; laud thou and
magnify Indra who heareth thee,  
Who with his daring might, a Bull exceeding strong in strength, maketh
him master of the heaven and earth.  
3 Sing forth to lofty Dyaus a strength-bestowing song, the Bold, whose
resolute mind hath independent sway.  
High glory hath the Asura, compact of strength, drawn on by two Bay
Steeds: a Bull, a Car is he.  
4 The ridges of the lofty heaven thou madest shake; thou, daring, of
thyself smotest through Śambara,  
When bold with gladdening juice, thou warredst with thy bolt, sharp and
two-edged, against the banded sorcerers.  
5 When with a roar that fills the woods, thou forcest down on wind's
head the stores which Śuṣṇa kept confined,  
Who shall have power to stay thee firm and eager-souled from doing still
this day what thou of old hast done?  
6 Thou helpest Narya, Turvaśa, and Yadu, and Vayya's son Turvīti,
Śatakratu!  
Thou helpest horse and car in final battle thou breakest down the
nine-and-ninety castles.  
7 A hero-lord is he, King of a mighty folk, who offers free oblations
and promotes the Law,  
Who with a bounteous guerdon welcomes hymns of praise: for him flows
down the abundant stream below the sky.  
8 His power is matchless, matchless is his wisdom; chief, through their
work, be some who drink the Soma,  
Those, Indra, who increase the lordly power, the firm heroic strength of
thee the Giver.  
9 Therefore for thee are these abundant beakers Indra's drink,
stone-pressed juices held in ladles.  
Quaff them and satisfy therewith thy longing; then fix thy mind upon
bestowing treasure.  
10 There darkness stood, the vault that stayed the waters’ flow: in
Vṛtra's hollow side the rain-cloud lay concealed.  
But Indra smote the rivers which the obstructer stayed, flood following
after flood, down steep declivities.  
11 So give us, Indra, bliss-increasing glory give us great sway and
strength that conquers people.  
Preserve our wealthy patrons, save our princes; vouchsafe us wealth and
food with noble offspring.
