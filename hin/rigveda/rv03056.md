### HYMN LVI. Viśvedevas.

1\. NOT men of magic skill, not men of wisdom impair the Gods’ first
steadfast ordinances.  
Ne’er may the earth and heaven which know not malice, nor the fixed
hills, be bowed by sage devices.  
2 One, moving not away, supports six burthens: the Cows proceed to him
the true, the Highest.  
Near stand three Mighty Ones who travel swiftly: two are concealed from
sight, one is apparent.  
3 The Bull who wears all shapes, the triple-breasted, three-uddered,
with a brood in many places,  
Ruleth majestic with his triple aspect, the Bull, the Everlasting Ones'
impregner.  
4 When nigh them, as their tracer he observed them: he called aloud the
dear name of Ādityas.  
The Goddesses, the Waters, stayed to meet him: they who were wandering
separate enclosed him.  
5 Streams! the wise Gods have thrice three habitations. Child of three
Mothers, he is Lord in synods.  
Three are the holy Ladies of the Waters, thrice here from heaven supreme
in our assembly.  
6 Do thou, O Savitar, from heaven thrice hither, three times a day, send
down thy blessings daily.  
Send us, O Bhaga, triple wealth and treasure; cause the two worlds to
prosper us, Preserver!  
7 Savitar thrice from heaven pours down abundance, and the fair-handed
Kings Varuṇa, Mitra;  
And spacious Heaven and Earth, yea, and the Waters, solicit wealth that
Savitar may send us.  
8 Three are the bright realms, best, beyond attainment, and three, the
Asura's Heroes, rule as Sovrans,  
Holy and vigorous, never to be injured. Thrice may the Gods from heaven
attend our synod.
