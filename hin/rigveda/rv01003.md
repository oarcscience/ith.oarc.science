### HYMN III. Aśvins

1 YE Aśvins, rich in treasure, Lords of splendour, having nimble
hands,  
Accept the sacrificial food.  
2 Ye Aśvins, rich in wondrous deeds, ye heroes worthy of our praise,  
Accept our songs with mighty thought.  
3 Nāsatyas, wonder-workers, yours are these libations with clipt
grass:  
Come ye whose paths are red with flame.  
4 O Indra marvellously bright, come, these libations long for thee,  
Thus by fine fingers purified.  
5 Urged by the holy singer, sped by song, come, Indra, to the prayers,  
Of the libation-pouring priest.  
6 Approach, O Indra, hasting thee, Lord of Bay Horses, to the prayers.  
In our libation take delight.  
7 Ye Viśvedevas, who protect, reward, and cherish men, approach  
Your worshipper's drink-offering.  
8 Ye Viśvedevas, swift at work, come hither quickly to the draught,  
As milch-kine hasten to their stalls.  
9 The Viśvedevas, changing shape like serpents, fearless, void of
guile,  
Bearers, accept the sacred draught  
10 Wealthy in spoil, enriched with hymns, may bright
[Sarasvatī](errata.htm#0.md) desire,  
With eager love, our sacrifice.  
11 Inciter of all pleasant songs, inspirer of all gracious thought,  
Sarasvatī accept our rite  
12 Sarasvatī, the mighty flood,—she with her light illuminates,  
She brightens every pious thought.
