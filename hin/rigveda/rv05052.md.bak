### HYMN LII Maruts.

1\. SING boldly forth, Śyāvāśva, with the Maruts who are loud in song,  
Who, holy, as their wont is, joy in glory that is free from guile.  
2 For in their boldness they are friends of firm and sure heroic
strength.  
They in their course, bold-spirited, guard all men of their own
accord.  
3 Like steers in rapid motion they advance and overtake the nights;  
And thus the Maruts’ power in heaven and on the earth we celebrate.  
4 With boldness to your Maruts let us offer laud and sacrifice:  
Who all, through ages of mankind, guard mortal man from injury.  
5 Praiseworthy, givers of good gifts, Heroes with full and perfect
strength -  
To Maruts, Holy Ones of heaven, will I extol the sacrifice.  
6 The lofty Heroes cast their spears and weapons bright with gleaming
gold.  
After these Maruts followed close, like laughing lightning from the sky,
a splendour of its own accord.  
7 They who waxed mighty, of the earth, they who are in the wide
mid-air,  
Or in the rivers’ compass, or in the abode of ample heaven.  
8 Praise thou the Maruts’ company, the valorous and truly strong,  
The Heroes, hasting, by themselves have yoked their deer for victory.  
9 Fair-gleaming, on Paruṣṇī they have clothed themselves in robes of
wool,  
And with their chariot tires they cleave the rock asunder in their
might.  
10 Whether as wanderers from the way or speeders on or to the path,  
Under these names the spreading band tend well the sacrifice for me.  
11 To this the Heroes well attend, well do their teams attend to this.  
Visible are their varied forms. Behold, they are Paravatas.  
12 Hymn-singing, seeking water, they, praising, have danced about the
spring.  
What are they unto me? No thieves, but helpers, splendid to behold.  
13 Sublime, with lightnings for their spears, Sages and Orderers are
they.  
Ṛṣi, adore that Marut host, and make them happy with thy song.  
14 Ṛṣi, invite the Marut band with offerings, as a maid her friend.  
From heaven, too, Bold Ones, in your might haste hither glorified with
songs.  
15 Thinking of these now let him come, as with the escort of the Gods,  
And with the splendid Princes, famed for rapid courses, to the gifts.  
16 Princes, who, when I asked their kin, named Pṛśni as their
Mother-cow,  
And the impetuous Rudra they, the Mighty Ones, declared their Sire.  
17 The mighty ones, the seven times seven, have singly given me hundred
gifts.  
I have obtained on Yamuna famed wealth in kine and wealth in steeds.
