### HYMN XCIII. Indra-Agni.

1\. SLAYERS of enemies, Indra and Agni, accept this day our new-born
pure laudation.  
Again, again I call you prompt to listen, best to give quickly strength
to him who craves it.  
2 For ye were strong to gain, exceeding mighty, growing together, waxing
in your vigour.  
Lords of the pasture filled with ample riches, bestow upon us strength
both fresh and lasting.  
3 Yea when the strong have entered our assembly, and singers seeking
with their hymns your favour,  
They are like steeds who come into the race-course, those men who call
aloud on Indra-Agni.  
4 The singer, seeking with his hymns your favour, begs splendid riches
of their first possessor.  
Further us with new bounties, Indra-Agni, armed with strong thunder,
slayers of the foeman.  
5 When two great hosts, arrayed against each other, meet clothed with
brightness, in the fierce encounter  
Stand ye beside the godly, smite the godless; and still assist the men
who press the Soma.  
6 To this our Soma-pressing, Indra-Agni, come ye prepared to show your
loving-kindness,  
For not at any time have ye despised us. So may I draw you with all
strengthenings hither.  
7 So Agni, kindled mid this adoration, invite thou Mitra, Varuṇa, and
Indra.  
Forgive whatever sin we have committed may Aryaman and Aditi remove
it.  
8 While we accelerate these our sacrifices, may we win strength from
both of you, O Agni:  
Ne’er may the Maruts, Indra, Viṣṇu slight us. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
