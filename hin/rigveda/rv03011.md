### HYMN Xl. Agni.

1\. AGNI is Priest, the great High Priest of sacrifice, most swift in
act:  
He knows the rite in constant course.  
2 Oblation-bearer, deathless, well inclined, an eager messenger,  
Agni comes nigh us with the thought.  
3 Ensign of sacrifice from of old, Agni well knoweth with his thought  
To prosper this man's aim and hope.  
4 Agni, illustrious from old time, the Son of Strength who knows all
life,  
The Gods have made to their Priest.  
5 Infallible is Agni, he who goes before the tribes of men,  
A chariot swift and ever new.  
6 Strength of the Gods which none may harm, subduing all his enemies,  
Agni is mightiest in fame.  
7 By offering sacred food to him the mortal worshipper obtains.  
A home from him whose light makes pure.  
8 From Agni, by our hymns, may we gain all things that bring
happiness,  
Singers of him who knows all life.  
9 O Agni, in our deeds of might may we obtain all precious things:  
Tle Gods are centred all in thee.
