### HYMN CXLI. Agni.

1\. YEA, verily, the fair effulgence of the God for glory was
established, since he sprang from strength.  
When he inclines thereto successful is the hymn: the songs of sacrifice
have brought him as they flow  
2 Wonderful, rich in nourishment, he dwells in food; next, in the seven
auspicious Mothers is his home.  
Thirdly, that they might drain the treasures of the Bull, the maidens
brought forth him for whom the ten provide.  
3 What time from out the deep, from the Steer's wondrous form, the
Chiefs who had the power produced him with their strength;  
When Mātariśvan rubbed forth him who lay concealed, for mixture of the
sweet drink, in the days of old.  
4 When from the Highest Father he is brought to us, amid the plants he
rises hungry, wondrously.  
As both together join to expedite his birth, most youthful he is born
resplendent in his light.  
5 Then also entered he the Mothers, and in them pure and uninjured he
increased in magnitude.  
As to the first he rose, the vigorous from of old, so now he runs among
the younger lowest ones.  
6 Therefore they choose him Herald at the morning rites, pressing to him
as unto Bhaga, pouring gifts,  
When, much-praised, by the power and will of Gods, he goes at all times
to his mortal worshipper to drink.  
7 What time the Holy One, wind-urged, hath risen up, serpent-like
winding through the dry grass unrestrained,  
Dust lies upon the way of him who burneth all, black-winged and pure of
birth who follows sundry paths.  
8 Like a swift chariot made by men who know their art, he with his red
limbs lifts himself aloft to heaven.  
Thy worshippers become by burning black of hue: their strength flies as
before a hero's violence.  
9 By thee, O Agni, Varuṇa who guards the Law, Mitra and Aryaman, the
Bounteous, are made strong;  
For, as the felly holds the spokes, thou with thy might pervading hast
been born encompassing them round.  
10 Agni, to him who toils and pours libations, thou, Most Youthful!
sendest wealth and all the host of Gods.  
Thee, therefore, even as Bhaga, will we set anew, young Child of
Strength, most wealthy! in our battle-song.  
11 Vouchsafe us riches turned to worthy ends, good luck abiding in the
house, and strong capacity,  
Wealth that directs both worlds as they were guiding-reins, and, very
Wise, the Gods’ assent in sacrifice.  
12 May he, the Priest resplendent, joyful, hear us, he with the radiant
car and rapid horses.  
May Agni, ever wise, with best directions to bliss and highest happiness
conduct us.  
13 With hymns of might hath Agni now been lauded, advanced to height of
universal kingship.  
Now may these wealthy chiefs and we together spread forth as spreads the
Sun above the rain-clouds.
