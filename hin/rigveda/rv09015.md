### HYMN XV. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THROUGH the fine fingers, with the song, this Hero comes with rapid
ears,  
Going to Indra's special place.  
2 In holy thought he ponders much for the great worship of the Gods.  
Where the Immortals have their seat.  
3 Like a good horse is he led out, when on the path that shines with
light  
The mettled steeds exert their strength.  
4 He brandishes his horns on high, and whets them Bull who leads the
herd,  
Doing with might heroic deeds.  
5 He moves, a vigorous Steed, adorned with beauteous rays of shining
gold,  
Becoming Sovran of the streams.  
6 He, over places rough to pass, bringing rich treasures closely
packed.  
Descends into the reservoirs.  
7 Men beautify him in the vats, him worthy to be beautified,  
Him who brings forth abundant food.  
8 Him, even him, the fingers ten and the seven songs make beautiful,  
Well-weaponed, best of gladdeners.
