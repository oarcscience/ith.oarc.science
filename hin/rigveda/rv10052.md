### HYMN LII. Gods.

1\. INSTRUCT me, all ye Gods, how I, elected your Priest, must seat me
here, and how address you.  
Instruct me how to deal to each his portion, and by what ' path to bring
you man's oblation.  
2 I sit as Priest most skilled in sacrificing: the Maruts and all
Deities impel me.  
Aśvins, each day yours is the Adhvaryu's duty: Brahman and wood are
here: ’tis yours to offer.  
3 Who is the Priest? Is he the Priest of Yama? On whom is thrust this
God-appointed honour?  
He springs to life each month, each day that passes; so Gods have made
him their oblation-bearer.  
4 The Gods have made me bearer of oblations, who slipped away and passed
through many troubles.  
Wise Agni shall ordain for us the worship, whether five-wayed,
threefold, or seven-threaded.  
5 So will I win you strength and life for ever. O Gods, that I may give
you room and freedom.  
To Indra's arms would I consign the thunder; in all these battles shall
he then be victor.  
6 The Deities three hundred and thirty-nine, have served and honoured
Agni,  
Strewn sacred grass, anointed him with butter, and seated him as Priest,
the Gods’ Invoker.
