### HYMN CI. Soma Pavamana

1\. FOR first possession of your juice, for the exhilarating drink,  
Drive ye away the dog, my friends, drive ye the long-tongued dog away.  
2 He who with purifying stream, effused, comes flowing hitherward,  
Indu, is like an able steed.  
3 The men with all-pervading song send unassailable Soma forth,  
By pressing-stones, to sacrifice.  
4 The Somas, very rich in sweets, for which the sieve is destined,
flow,  
Effused, the source of Indra's joy: may your strong juices reach the
Gods.  
5 Indu flows on for Indra's sake: thus have the Deities declared.  
The Lord of Speech exerts himself, Ruler of all, because of might.  
6 Inciter of the voice of song, with thousand streams the ocean flows,  
Even Soma, Lord of opulence, the Friend of Indra, day by day.  
7 As Pūṣan, Fortune, Bhaga, comes this Soma while they make him pure.  
He, Lord of the multitude, hath looked upon the earth and heaven.  
8 The dear cows lowed in joyful mood together to the gladdening drink.  
The drops as they were purified, the Soma juices, made then paths.  
9 O Pavamana, bring the juice, the mightiest, worthy to be famed,  
Which the Five Tribes have over them, whereby we may win opulence.  
10 For us the Soma juices flow, the drops best furtherers of our weal,  
Effused as friends without a spot, benevolent, finders of the light.  
11 Effused by means of pressing-stones, upon the ox-hide visible,  
They, treasure-finders, have announced food unto us from every side.  
12 Tlese Soma juices, skilled in song, purified, blent with milk and
curd,  
When moving and when firmly laid in oil, resemble lovely Suns.  
13 Let not the power of men restrain the voice of the outpouring
juice:  
As Bhṛgu's sons chased Makha, so drive ye the greedy hound away.  
14 The Friend hath wrapped him in his robe, as in his parents arms, a
son.  
He went, as lover to a dame, to take his station suitor-like.  
15 That Hero who produces strength, he who hath propped both worlds
apart,  
Gold-hued, hath wrapped him in the sieve, to settle, priest-like, in his
place.  
16 Soma upon the ox's skin through the sheep's wool flows purified.  
Bellowing out, the Tawny Steer goes on to Indra's special place.
