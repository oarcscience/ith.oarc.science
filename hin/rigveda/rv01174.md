### HYMN CLXXIV. Indra.

1\. THOU art the King of all the Gods, O Indra: protect the men, O
Asura, preserve us.  
Thou Lord of Heroes, Maghavan, our saver, art faithful, very rich, the
victory-giver.  
2 Indra, thou humbledst tribes that spake with insult by breaking down
seven autumn forts, their refuge.  
Thou stirredst, Blameless! billowy floods, and gavest his foe a prey to
youthful Purukutsa.  
3 With whom thou drivest troops whose lords are heroes, and bringest
daylight now, much worshipped Indra,  
With them guard lion-like wasting active Agni to dwell in our tilled
fields and in our homestead.  
4 They through the greatness of thy spear, O Indra, shall, to thy
praise, rest in this earthly station.  
To loose the floods, to seek, for kine, the battle, his Bays he mounted
boldly seized the booty.  
5 Indra, bear Kutsa, him in whom thou joyest: the dark-red horses of the
Wind are docile.  
Let the Sun roll his chariot wheel anear us, and let the Thunderer go to
meet the foemen.  
6 Thou Indra, Lord of Bays, made strong by impulse, hast slain the
vexers of thy friends, who give not.  
They who beheld the Friend beside the living were cast aside by thee as
they rode onward.  
7 Indra, the bard sang forth in inspiration: thou madest earth a
covering for the Dāsa.  
Maghavan made the three that gleam with moisture, and to his home
brought Kuyavāc to slay him.  
8 These thine old deeds new bards have sung, O Indra. Thou conqueredst,
boundest many tribes for ever.  
Like castles thou hast crushed the godless races, and bowed the godless
scorner's deadly weapon.  
9 A Stormer thou hast made the stormy waters flow down, O Indra, like
the running rivers.  
When o’er the flood thou broughtest them, O Hero, thou keptest Turvaśa
and Yadu safely.  
10 Indra, mayst thou be ours in all occasions, protector of the men,
most gentle-hearted,  
Giving us victory over all our rivals. May we find strengthening food in
full abundance.
