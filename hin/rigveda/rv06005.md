### HYMN V. Agni.

1\. I INVOCATE your Son of Strength, the Youthful, with hymns, the
Youngest God, whose speech is guileless;  
Sage who sends wealth comprising every treasure, bringer of many boons,
devoid of malice.  
2 At eve and morn thy pious servants bring thee their precious gifts, O
Priest of many aspects,  
On whom, the Purifier, all things living as on firm. ground their
happiness have stablished.  
3 Thou from of old hast dwelt among these people, by mental power the
charioteer of blessings.  
Hence sendest thou, O sapient Jātavedas, to him who serves thee
treasures in succession.  
4 Agni, whoever secretly attacks us, the neighbour, thou with Mitra's
might! who harms us,  
Burn him with thine own Steers for ever youthful, burning with burning
heat, thou fiercest burner.  
5 He who serves thee with sacrifice and fuel, with hymn, O Son of
Strength, and chanted praises,  
Shines out, Immortal! in the midst of mortals, a sage, with wealth, with
splendour and with glory.  
6 Do this, O Agni, when we urge thee, quickly, triumphant in thy might
subdue our foemen.  
When thou art praised with words and decked with brightness, accept this
chanted hymn, the singer's worship.  
7 Help us, that we may gain this wish, O Agni, gain riches, Wealthy One!
with store of heroes.  
Desiring strength from thee may we be strengthened, and win, Eternal!
thine eternal glory.
