*Rig Veda*, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, \[1896\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

### HYMN CLI. Faith.

1\. By Faith is Agni kindled, through Faith is oblation offered up.  
We celebrate with praises Faith upon the height of happiness.  
2 Bless thou the man who gives, O Faith; Faith, bless the man who fain
would give.  
Bless thou the liberal worshippers: bless thou the word that I have
said.  
3 Even as the Deities maintained Faith in the mighty Asuras,  
So make this uttered wish of mine true for the liberal worshippers.  
4 Guarded by Vāyu, Gods and men who sacrifice draw near to Faith.  
Man winneth Faith by yearnings of the heart, and opulence by Faith.  
5 Faith in the early morning, Faith at noonday will we invocate,  
Faith at the setting of the Sun. O Faith, endow us with belief.
