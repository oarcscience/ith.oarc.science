### HYMN LXXII. Indra-Soma.

1\. GREAT is this might of yours, Indra and Soma: the first high
exploits were your own achievements.  
Ye found the Sun ye found the light of heaven: ye killed all darkness
and the Gods’ blasphemers.  
2 Ye, Indra-Soma, gave her light to Morning, and led the Sun on high
with all his splendour.  
Ye stayed the heaven with a supporting pillar, and spread abroad apart,
the Earth, the Mother.  
3 Ye slew the flood -obstructing serpent Vṛtra, Indra and Soma: Heaven
approved your exploit.  
Ye urged to speed the currents of the rivers, and many seas have ye
filled full with waters.  
4 Ye in the unripe udders of the milch-kine have set the ripe milk,
Indra, thou, and Soma.  
Ye have held fast the unimpeded whiteness within these many-coloured
moving creatures.  
5 Verily ye bestow, Indra and Soma, wealth, famed, victorious, passing
to our children.  
Ye have invested men, ye Mighty Beings, with manly strength that
conquers in the battle.
