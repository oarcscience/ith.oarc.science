### HYMN IX. Agni.

1\. ACCUSTOMED to the Herald's place, the Herald hath seated him,
bright, splendid, passing mighty,  
Whose foresight keeps the Law from violation, excellent, pure-tongued,
bringing thousands, Agni.  
2 Envoy art thou, protector from the foeman, strong God, thou leadest us
to higher blessings.  
Refulgent, be an ever-heedful keeper, Agni, for us and for our seed
offspring.  
3 May we adore thee in thy loftiest birthplace, and, with our praises,
in thy lower station.  
The place whence thou issued forth I worship: to thee well kindled have
they paid oblations.  
4 Agni, best Priest, pay worship with oblation; quickly commend the gift
to be presented;  
For thou art Lord of gathered wealth and treasure. of the bright song of
praise thou art inventor.  
5 The twofold opulence, O Wonder-Worker, of thee new-born each day never
decreases.  
Enrich with food the man who lauds thee, Agni: make him the lord of
wealth with noble offspring.  
6 May he, benevolent with this fair aspect, best sacrificer, bring the
Gods to bless us.  
Sure guardian, our protector from the foemen, shine, Agni, with thine
affluence and splendour.
