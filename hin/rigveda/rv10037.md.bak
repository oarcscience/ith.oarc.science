### HYMN XXXVII. Sūrya.

1\. Do homage unto Varuṇa's and Mitra's Eye: offer this solemn worship
to the Mighty God,  
Who seeth far away, the Ensign, born of Gods. Sing praises unto Sūrya,
to the Son of Dyaus.  
2 May this my truthful speech guard me on every side wherever heaven and
earth and days are spread abroad.  
All else that is in motion finds a place of rest: the waters ever flow
and ever mounts the Sun.  
3 No godless man from time remotest draws thee down when thou art
driving forth with winged dappled Steeds.  
One lustre waits upon thee moving to the cast, and, Sūrya, thou arisest
with a different light.  
4 O Sūrya, with the light whereby thou scatterest gloom, and with thy
ray impellest every moving thing,  
Keep far from us all feeble, worthless sacrifice, and drive away disease
and every evil dream.  
5 Sent forth thou guardest well the Universe's law, and in thy wonted
way arisest free from wrath.  
When Sūrya, we address our prayers to thee to-day, may the Gods favour
this our purpose and desire.  
6 This invocation, these our words may Heaven and Earth, and Indra and
the Waters and the Maruts hear.  
Ne’er may we suffer want in presence of the Sun, and, living happy
lives, may we attain old age.  
7 Cheerful in spirit, evermore, and keen of sight, with store of
children, free from sickness and from sin,  
Long-living, may we look, O Sūrya, upon thee uprising day by day, thou
great as Mitra is!  
8 Sūrya, may we live long and look upon thee still, thee, O Far-seeing
One, bringing the glorious light,  
The radiant God, the spring of joy to every eye, as thou art mounting up
o’er the high shining flood.  
9 Thou by whose lustre all the world of life comes forth, and by thy
beams again returns unto its rest,  
O Sūrya with the golden hair, ascend for us day after day, still
bringing purer innocence.  
10 Bless us with shine, bless us with perfect daylight, bless us with
cold, with fervent heat and lustre.  
Bestow on us, O Sūrya, varied riches, to bless us in our home and when
we travel.  
11 Gods, to our living creatures of both kinds vouchsafe protection,
both to bipeds and to quadrupeds,  
That they may drink and eat invigorating food. So grant us health and
strength and perfect innocence.  
12 If by some grievous sin we have provoked the Gods, O Deities, with
the tongue or thoughtlessness of heart,  
That guilt, O Vasus, lay upon the Evil One, on him who ever leads us
into deep distress.
