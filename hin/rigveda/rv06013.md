### HYMN XIII. Agni.

1\. FROM thee, as branches from a tree, O Agni, from thee, Auspicious
God! spring all our blessings-  
Wealth swiftly, strength in battle with our foemen, the rain besought of
heaven, the flow of waters.  
2 Thou art our Bhaga to send wealth thou dwellest, like circumambient
air, with wondrous splendour.  
Friend art thou of the lofty Law, like Mitra, Controller, Agni! God! of
many a blessing.  
3 Agni! the hero slays with might his foeman; the singer bears away the
Paṇi's booty-  
Even he whom thou, Sage, born in Law, incitest by wealth, accordant with
the Child of Waters.  
4 The man who, Son of Strength 1 with sacrifices, hymns, lauds, attracts
thy fervour to the altar,  
Enjoys each precious thing, O God, O Agni, gains wealth of corn and is
the lord of treasures.  
5 Grant, Son of Strength, to men for their subsistence such things as
bring high fame and hero children.  
For thou with might givest much food in cattle even to the wicked wolf
when he is hungry.  
6 Eloquent, Son of Strength, Most Mighty, Agni, vouchsafe us seed and
offspring, full of vigour.  
May I by all my songs obtain abundance. May brave sons gladden us
through a hundred winters.
