### HYMN XLV. Agni.

1\. FIRST Agni sprang to life from out of Heaven: the second time from
us came Jātavedas.  
Thirdly the Manly-souled was in the waters. The pious lauds and kindles
him the Eternal.  
2 Agni, we know thy three powers in three stations, we know thy forms in
many a place divided.  
We know what name supreme thou hast in secret: we know the source from
which thou hast proceeded.  
3 The Manly-souled lit thee in sea and waters, man's Viewer lit thee in
the breast of heaven,  
There as thou stoodest in the third high region the Steers increased
thee in the water's bosom.  
4 Agni roared out, like Dyaus what time he thunders: he licked the
ground about the plants he flickered.  
At once, when born, he looked around enkindled, and lightened heaven and
earth within with splendour.  
5 The spring of glories and support of riches, rouser of thoughts and
guardian of the Soma,  
Good Son of Strength, a King amid the waters, in forefront of the Dawns
he shines enkindled.  
6 Germ of the world, ensign of all creation, be sprang to life and
filled the earth and heavens.  
Even the firm rock he cleft when passing over, when the Five Tribes
brought sacrifice to Agni.  
7 So among mortals was Immortal Agni stablished as holy wise and willing
envoy.  
He waves the red smoke that he lifts above him, striving to reach the
heavens with radiant lustre.  
8 Like gold to look on, far he shone refulgent, beaming imperishable
life for glory,  
Agni by vital powers became immortal when his prolific Father Dyaus
begat him.  
9 Whoso this day, O God whose flames are lovely, prepares a cake, O
Agni, mixt with butter,  
Lead thou and further him to higher fortune, to bliss bestowed by Gods,
O thou Most Youthful.  
10 Endow him, Agni, with a share of glory, at every song of praise sung
forth enrich him.  
Dear let him be to Sūrya, dear to Agni, preeminent with son and
children's children.  
11 While, Agni, day by day men pay thee worship they win themselves all
treasures worth the wishing.  
Allied with thee, eager and craving riches, they have disclosed the
stable filled with cattle.  
12 Agni, the Friend of men, the Soma's keeper, Vaiśvānara, hath been
lauded by the Ṛṣis.  
We will invoke benignant Earth and Heaven: ye Deities, give us wealth
with hero children.
