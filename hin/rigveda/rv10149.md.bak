### HYMN CXLIX. Savitar.

1\. SAVITAR fixed the earth with bands to bind it, and made heaven
stedfast where no prop supported.  
Savitar milked, as ’twere a restless courser, air, sea bound fast to
what no foot had trodden.  
2 Well knoweth Savitar, O Child of Waters, where ocean, firmly fixt,
o’erflowed its limit.  
Thence sprang the world, from that uprose the region: thence heaven
spread out and the wide earth expanded.  
3 Then, with a full crowd of Immortal Beings, this other realm came
later, high and holy.  
First, verily, Savitar's strong-pinioned Eagle was born: and he obeys
his law for ever.  
4 As warriors to their steeds, kine to their village, as fond milk
giving cows approach their youngling,  
As man to wife, let Savitar come downward to us, heaven's bearer, Lord
of every blessing.  
5 Like the Aṅgirasa Hiranvastupa, I call thee, Savitar, to this
achievement:  
So worshipping and lauding thee for favour I watch for thee as for the
stalk of Soma.
