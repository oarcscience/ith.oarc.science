### HYMN XXXIX. Aśvins.

1\. SING like the two press-stones for this same purpose; come like two
misers to the tree of treasure;  
Like two laud-singing Brahmans in the assembly, like the folk's envoys
called in many places.  
2 Moving at morning like two car-borne heroes, like to a pair of goats
ye come electing;  
Like two fair dames embellishing their bodies, like a wise married pair
among the people.  
3 Like to a pair of horns come first to us-ward, like to a pair of hoofs
with rapid motion;  
Come like two Cakavās in the grey of morning, come like two chariot
wheels at dawn, ye Mighty.  
4 Bear us across the rivers like two vessels, save us as ye were yokes,
naves, spokes and fellies.  
Be like two dogs that injure not our bodies; preserve us, like two
crutches, that we fall not.  
5 Like two winds ageing not, two confluent rivers, come with quick
vision like two eyes before us.  
Come like two hands most helpful to the body, and guide us like two feet
to what is precious.  
6 Even as two lips that with the mouth speak honey, even as two breasts
that nourish our existence,  
Like the two nostrils that protect our being, be to us as our ears that
hear distinctly.  
7 Like two hands give ye us increasing vigour; like heaven and earth
constrain the airy regions.  
Aśvins, these hymns that struggle to approach you, sharpen ye like an
axe upon a whetstone.  
8 These prayers of ours exalting you, O Aśvins, have the Gṛtsamadas, for
a laud, made ready.  
Welcome them, O ye Heroes, and come hither. Loud may we speak. with
brave men, in assembly.
