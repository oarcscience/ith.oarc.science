### HYMN XXI. Soma Pavamana.

1\. To Indra flow these running drops, these Somas frolicsome in mood.  
Exhilarating, finding light;  
2 Driving off foes, bestowing room upon the presser, willingly  
Bringing their praiser vitalforce.  
3 Lightly disporting them, the drops flow to one common reservoir,  
And fall into the river's wave.  
4 These Pavamanas have obtained all blessings much to be desired,  
Like coursers harnessed to a car.  
5 With view to us, O Soma-drops, bestow his manifold desire  
On him who yet hath given us naught.  
6 Bring us our wish with this design, as a wright brings his new-wrought
wheel:  
Flow pure and shining with the stream.  
7 These drops have cried with resonant voice: like swift steeds they
have run the course,  
And roused the good man's hymn to life.
