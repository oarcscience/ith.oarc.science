### HYMN CXXXV. Vāyu, Indra-Vāyu.

1\. STREWN is the sacred grass; come Vāyu, to our feast, with team of
thousands, come, Lord of the harnessed team, with hundreds, Lord of
harnessed steeds!  
The drops divine are lifted up for thee, the God, to drink them first.  
The juices rich in sweets have raised them for thy joy, have raised
themselves to give thee strength.  
2 Purified by the stones the Soma flows for thee, clothed with its
lovely splendours, to the reservoir, flows clad in its refulgent
light.  
For thee the Soma is poured forth, thy portioned share mid Gods and
men.  
Drive thou thy horses, Vāyu, come to us with love, come well-inclined
and loving us.  
3 Come thou with hundreds, come with thousands in thy team to this our
solemn rite, to taste the sacred food, Vāyu, to taste the offerings.  
This is thy seasonable share, that comes co-radiant with the Sun.  
Brought by attendant priests pure juice is offered up, Vāyu, pure juice
is offered up.  
4 The chariot with its team of horses bring you both, to guard us and to
taste the well-appointed food, Vāyu, to taste the offerings!  
Drink of the pleasant-flavoured juice: the first draught is assigned to
you.  
O Vāyu, with your splendid bounty come ye both, Indra, with bounty come
ye both.  
5 May our songs bring you hither to our solemn rites: these drops of
mighty vigour have they beautified, like a swift steed of mighty
strength.  
Drink of them well-inclined to us, come hitherward to be our help.  
Drink, Indra-Vāyu, of these Juices pressed with stones, Strength-givers!
till they gladden you.  
6 These Soma juices pressed for you in waters here, borne by attendant
priests, are offered up to you: bright, Vāyu, are they offered up.  
Swift through the strainer have they flowed, and here are shed for both
of you,  
Soma-drops, fain for you, over the wether's fleece, Somas over the
wether's fleece.  
7 O Vāyu, pass thou over all the slumberers, and where the press-stone
rings enter ye both that house, yea, Indra, go ye both within.  
The joyous Maiden is beheld, the butter flows. With richly laden team
come to our solemn rite, yea, Indra, come ye to the rite.  
8 Ride hither to the offering of the pleasant juice, the holy Fig-tree
which victorious priests surround: victorious be they still for us.  
At once the cows yield milk, the barley-meal is dressed. For thee,  
O Vāyu, never shall the cows grow thin, never for thee shall they be
dry.  
9 These Bulls of thine, O Vāyu with the arm of strength, who swiftly fly
within the current of thy stream, the Bulls increasing in their might,  
Horseless, yet even through the waste swift-moving, whom no shout can
stay,  
Hard to be checked are they, like sunbeams, in their course. hard to be
checked by both the hands.
