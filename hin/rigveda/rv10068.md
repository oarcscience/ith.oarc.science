### HYMN LXVIII. Bṛhaspati.

1\. LIKE birds who keep their watch, plashing in water, like the loud
voices of the thundering rain-cloud,  
Like merry streamlets bursting from the mountain, thus to Bṛhaspati our
hymns have sounded.  
2 The Son of Aṅgirases, meeting the cattle, as Bhaga, brought in Aryaman
among us.  
As Friend of men he decks the wife and husband: as for the race,
Bṛhaspati, nerve our coursers.  
3 Bṛhaspati, having won them from the mountains, strewed down, like
barley out of winnowing- baskets,  
The vigorous, wandering cows who aid the pious, desired of all, of
blameless form, well-coloured.  
4 As the Sun dews with meath the seat of Order, and casts a flaming
meteor down from heaven.  
So from the rock Bṛhaspati forced the cattle, and cleft the earth's skin
as it were with water.  
5 Forth from mid air with light he dravc the darkness, as the gale blows
a lily from the fiver.  
Like the wind grasping at the cloud of Vala, Bṛhaspati gathered to
himself the cattle,  
6 Bṛhaspati, when he with fiery lightnings cleft through the weapon of
reviling Vala,  
Consumedḥim as tongues cat what teeth have compassed: he threw the
prisons of the red cows open.  
7 That secret name borne by the lowing cattle within the cave Bṛhaspati
discovered,  
And drave, himself, the bright kine from the mountain, like a bird's
young after the egg's disclosure.  
8 He looked around on rock-imprisoned sweetness as one who eyes a fish
in scanty water.  
Bṛhaspati, cleaving through with varied clamour, brought it forth like a
bowl from out the timber.  
9 He found the light of heaven, and fire, and Morning: with lucid rays
he forced apart the darkness.  
As from a joint, Bṛhaspati took the marrow of Vala as he gloried in his
cattle.  
10 As trees for foliage robbed by winter, Vala mourned for the cows
Bṛhaspati had taken.  
He did a deed ne’er done, ne’er to be equalled, whereby the Sun and Moon
ascend alternate.  
11 Like a dark steed adorned with pearl, the Fathers have decorated
heaven With constellations.  
They set the light in day, in night the darkness. Bṛhaspati cleft the
rock and found the cattle.  
12 This homage have we.offered to the Cloud God who thunders out to many
in succession.  
May this Bṛhaspati vouchsafe us fulness of life with kine and horses,
men, and heroes.
