### HYMN LXXVII. Indra.

1\. As cows low to their calves in stalls, so with our songs we
glorify  
This Indra, even your Wondrous God who checks attack, who joys in the
delicious juice.  
2 Celestial, bounteous Giver, girt about with might, rich,
mountain-like, in precious things,  
Him swift we seek. for foodful booty rich in kine, brought hundredfold
and thousandfold.  
3 Indra, the strong and lofty hills are powerless to bar thy way.  
None stay that act of thine when thou wouldst fain give wealth to one
like me who sings thy praise.  
4 A Warrior thou by strength, wisdom, and wondrous deed, in might
excellest all that is.  
Hither may this our hymn attract thee to our help, the hymn which
Gotamas have made.  
5 For in thy might thou stretchest out beyond the boundaries of
heaven.  
The earthly region, Indra, comprehends thee not. After thy Godhead hast
thou waxed.  
6 When, Maghavan, thou honourest the worshipper, no one is there to stay
thy wealth.  
Most liberal Giver thou, do thou inspire our song of praise, that we may
win the spoil.
