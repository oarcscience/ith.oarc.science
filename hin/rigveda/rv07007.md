### HYMN VII. Agni.

1\. I SEND forth even your God, victorious Agni, like a strong courser,
with mine adoration.  
Herald of sacrifice be he who knoweth he hath reached Gods, himself,
with measured motion.  
2 By paths that are thine own come hither, Agni, joyous, delighting in
the Gods’ alliance,  
Making the heights of earth roar with thy fury, burning with eager teeth
the woods and forests.  
3 The grass is strewn; the sacrifice advances adored as Priest, Agni is
made propitious,  
Invoking both All-boon-bestowing Mothers of whom, Most Youthful! thou
wast born to help us.  
4 Forthwith the men, the best of these for wisdom, have made him leader
in the solemn worship.  
As Lord in homes of men is Agni stablished, the Holy One, the joyous,
sweetly speaking.  
5 He hath come, chosen bearer, and is seated in man's home, Brahman,
Agni, the Supporter,  
He whom both Heaven anct Earth exalt and strengthenwhom, Giver of all
boons, the Hotar worships.  
6 These have passed all in glory, who, the manly, have wrought with
skill the hymn of adoration;  
Who, listening, have advanced the people's welfare, and set their
thoughts on this my holy statute.  
7 We, the Vasisthas, now implore thee, Agni, O Son of Strength, the Lord
of wealth and treasure.  
Thou hast brought food to singers and to nobles. Ye Gods, preserve us
evermore with blessings.
