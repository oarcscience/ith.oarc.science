### HYMN XXIII. Brahmaṇaspati.

1\. WE call thee, Lord and Leader of the heavenly hosts, the wise among
the wise, the famousest of all,  
The King supreme of prayers, O Brahmaṇaspati: hear us with help; sit
down in place of sacrifice.  
2 Bṛhaspati, God immortal! verily the Gods have gained from thee, the
wise, a share in holy rites.  
As with great light the Sun brings forth the rays of morn, so thou alone
art Father of all sacred prayer.  
3 When thou hast chased away revilers and the gloom, thou mountest the
refulgent car of sacrifice;  
The awful car, Bṛhaspati, that quells the foe, slays demons, cleaves the
stall of kine, and finds the light.  
4 Thou leadest with good guidance and preservest men; distress o’ertakes
not him who offers gifts to thee.  
Him who hates prayer thou punishest, Bṛhaspati, quelling his wrath:
herein is thy great mightiness.  
5 No sorrow, no distress from any side, no foes, no creatures
double-tongued have overcome the man,—  
Thou drivest all seductive fiends away from him whom, careful guard,
thou keepest Brahmaṇaspati.  
6 Thou art our keeper, wise, preparer of our paths: we, for thy service,
sing to thee with hymns of praise.  
Bṛhaspati, whoever lays a snare for us, him may his evil fate,
precipitate, destroy.  
7 Him, too, who threatens us without offence of ours, the evilminded,
arrogant, rapacious man,—  
Him turn thou from our path away, Bṛhaspati: give us fair access to this
banquet of the Gods.  
8 Thee as protector of our bodies we invoke, thee, saviour, as the
comforter who loveth us.  
Strike, O Bṛhaspati, the Gods’ revilers down, and let not the
unrighteous come to highest bliss.  
9 Through thee, kind prosperer, O Brahmaṇaspati, may we obtain the
wealth of Men which all desire:  
And all our enemies, who near or far away prevail against us, crush, and
leave them destitute.  
10 With thee as our own rich and liberal ally may we, Bṛhaspati, gain
highest power of life.  
Let not the guileful wicked man be lord of us:—still may we prosper,
singing goodly hymns of praise.  
11 Strong, never yielding, hastening to the battle-cry, consumer of the
foe, victorious in the strife,  
Thou art sin's true avenger, Brahmaṇaspati, who tamest e’en the fierce,
the wildly passionate.  
12 Whoso with mind ungodly seeks to do us harm, who, deeming him a man
of might mid lords, would slay,—  
Let not his deadly blow reach us, Bṛhaspati; may we humiliate the strong
ill-doer's wrath.  
13 The mover mid the spoil, the winner of all wealth, to be invoked in
fight and reverently adored,  
Bṛhaspati hath overthrown like cars of war all wicked enemies who fain
would injure us.  
14 Burn up the demons with thy fiercest flaming brand, those who have
scorned thee in thy manifested might.  
Show forth that power that shall deserve the hymn of praise: destroy the
evil speakers, O Bṛhaspati.  
15 Bṛhaspati, that which the foe deserves not which shines among the
folk effectual, splendid,  
That, Son of Law I which is with might refulgent-that treasure wonderful
bestow thou on us.  
16 Give us not up to those who, foes in ambuscade, are greedy for the
wealth of him who sits at ease,  
Who cherish in their heart abandonment of Gods. Bṛhaspati, no further
rest shall they obtain.  
17 For Tvaṣṭar, he who knows each sacred song, brought thee to life,
preeminent o’er all the things that be.  
Guilt-scourger, guilt-avenger is Bṛhaspati, who slays the spoiler and
upholds the mighty Law.  
18 The mountain, for thy glory, cleft itself apart when, Aṅgiras! thou
openedst the stall of kine.  
Thou, O Bṛhaspati, with Indra for ally didst hurl down water-floods
which gloom had compassed round.  
19 O Brahmaṇaspati, be thou controller of this our hymn and prosper thou
our children.  
All that the Gods regard with love is blessed. Loud may we speak, with
heroes, in assembly.
