### HYMN XXX. Soma Pavamana.

1\. STREAMS of this Potent One have flowed easily to the
straining-cloth:  
While he is cleansed he lifts his voice.  
2 Indu, by pressers urged to speed, bellowing out while beautified.  
Sends forth a very mighty sound.  
3 Pour on us, Soma, with thy stream manconquering might which many
crave,  
Accompanied with hero sons.  
4 Hither hath Pavamana flowed, Soma flowed hither in a stream,  
To settle in the vats of wood.  
5 To waters with the stones they drive thee tawny-hued, most rich in
sweets,  
O Indu, to be Indra's drink.  
6 For Indra, for the Thunderer press the Soma very rich in sweets,  
Lovely, inspiriting, for strength.
