### HYMN IX.

1\. WE as thy friends have chosen thee, mortals a God, to be our help,  
The Waters’ Child, the blessed, the resplendent One, victorious and
beyond compare.  
2 Since thou delighting in the woods hast gone unto thy mother
streams,  
Not to be scorned, Agni, is that return of thine when from afar thou now
art here.  
3 O'er pungent smoke host thou prevailed, and thus art thou
benevolent.  
Some go before, and others round about thee sit, they in whose
friendship thou hast place.  
4 Him who had passed beyond his foes, beyond continual pursuits, Him the
unerring Ones, observant, found in floods, couched like a lion in his
lair.  
5 Him wandering at his own free will, Agni here hidden from our view,  
Him Mātariśvan brought to us from far away produced by friction, from
the Gods.  
6 O Bearer of Oblations, thus mortals received thee from the Gods,  
Whilst thou, the Friend of man, guardest each sacrifice with thine own
power, Most Youthful One.  
7 Amid thy wonders this is good, yea, to the simple is it clear,  
When gathered round about thee, Agni, lie the herds where thou art
kindled in the morn.  
8 Offer to him who knows fair rites, who burns with purifying glow,  
Swift envoy, active, ancient, and adorable: serve ye the God
attentively.  
9 Three times a hundred Gods and thrice a thousand, and three times ten
and nine have worshipped Agni,  
For him spread sacred grass, with oil bedewed him, and stablished him as
Priest and Sacrificer.
