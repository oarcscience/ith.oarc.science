### HYMN LXXXVIII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. FOR thee this Soma is effused, O Indra: drink of this juice; for
thee the stream is flowing-  
Soma, which thou thyself hast made and chosen, even Indu, for thy
special drink to cheer thee.  
2 Like a capacious car hath it been harnessed, the Mighty; to acquire
abundant treasures.  
Then in the sacrifice they celebrated all triumphs won by Nahus -n the
battle.  
3 Like Vāyu with his team, moving at pleasure, most gracious when
invoked like both Nāsatyas,  
Thou art thyself like the Wealth-Giver, Soma! who grants all boons, like
song-inspiring Pūṣan.  
4 Like Indra who hath done great deeds, thou, Soma, art slayer of the
Vṛtras, Fort-destroyer.  
Like Pedu's horse who killed the brood of serpents, thus thou, O Soma,
slayest every Dasyu.  
5 Like Agni loosed amid the forest, fiercely he winneth splendour in the
running waters.  
Like one who fights, the roaring of the mighty, thus Soma Pavamana sends
his current.  
6 These Somas passing through the fleecy filter, like rain descending
from the clouds of heaven,  
Have been effused and poured into the beakers, swiftly like rivers
running lowly seaward.  
7 Flow onward like the potent band of Maruts, like that Celestial Host
whom none revileth.  
Quickly be gracious unto us like waters, like sacrifice victorious,
thousand-fashioned.  
8 Thine are King Varuṇa's eternal statutes, lofty and deep, O Soma, is
thy glory.  
All-pure art thou like Mitra the beloved, adorable, like Aryaman, O
Soma.
