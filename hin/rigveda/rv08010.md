Heritage

### HYMN X. Aśvins.

1\. WHETHER ye travel far away or dwell in yonder light of heaven,  
Or in a mansion that is built above the sea, come thence, ye Aśvins,
hitherward.  
2 Or if for Manu.ye prepared the sacrifice, remember also Kaṇva's son.  
I call Bṛhaspati, Indra, Viṣṇu, all the gods, the Aśvins borne by rapid
steeds.  
3 Those Aśvins I invoke who work marvels, brought hither to receive,  
With whom our friendship is most famed, and kinship passing that of
Gods.  
4 On whom the solemn rites depend, whose worshippers rise without the
Sun:  
These who foreknow the holy work of sacrifice, and by their Godhead
drink the sweets of Soma juice.  
5 Whether ye, Lords of ample wealth, now linger in the cast or west,  
With Druhyu, or with Anu, Yadu, Turvaga, I call you hither; come to
me.  
6 Lords of great riches, whether through the firmament ye fly or speed
through heaven and earth,  
Or with your Godlike natures stand upon your cars, come thence, O
Aśvins, hitherward.
