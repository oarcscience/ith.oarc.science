### HYMN CII. Indra.

1\. To thee the Mighty One I bring this mighty hymn, for thy desire hath
been gratified by my laud.  
In Indra, yea in him victorious through his strength, the Gods have
joyed at feast and when the Soma flowed.  
2 The Seven Rivers bear his glory far and wide, and heaven and sky and
earth display his comely form.  
The Sun and Moon in change alternate run their course, that we, O Indra,
may behold and may have faith.  
3 Maghavan, grant us that same car to bring us spoil, thy conquering car
in which we joy in shock of fight.  
Thou, Indra, whom our hearts praise highly in the war, grant shelter,
Maghavan, to us who love thee well.  
4 Encourage thou our side in every fight: may we, with thee for our
ally, conquer the foeman's host.  
Indra, bestow on us joy and felicity break down, O Maghavan, the vigour
of our foes.  
5 For here in divers ways these men invoking thee, holder of treasures,
sing hymns to win thine aid.  
Ascend the car that thou mayest bring spoil to us, for, Indra, thy fixt
winneth the victory.  
6 His arms win kine, his power is boundless in each act best, with a
hundred helps, waker of battle's din  
Is Indra: none may rival him in mighty strength. Hence, eager for the
spoil the people call on him.  
7 Thy glory, Maghavan, exceeds a hundred yea, more than a hundred, than
a thousand mid the folk,  
The great bowl hath inspirited thee boundlessly: so mayst thou slay the
Vṛtras, breaker-down of forts!  
8 Of thy great might there is a three counterpart, the three earths,
Lord men and the three realms of light.  
Above this whole world, Indra, thou hast waxen great: without a foe art
thou, nature, from of old.  
9 We invocate thee first among the Deities: thou hast become a mighty
Conquer in fight.  
May Indra fill with spirit this our singer's heart, and make our car
impetuous, foremost in attack.  
10 Thou hast prevailed, and hast not kept the booty back, in trifling
battles in those of great account.  
We make thee keen, the Mighty One, succour us: inspire us, Maghavan,
when we defy the foe.  
11 May Indra evermore be our Protector, and unimperilled may we win the
booty.  
This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu,
Earth and Heaven.
