### HYMN XVII. Agni.

1\. DULY enkindled after ancient customs, bringing all treasures, he is
balmed with unguents,—  
Flame-haired, oil-clad, the purifying Agni, skilled in fair rites, to
bring the Gods for worship.  
2 As thou, O Agni, skilful Jātavedas, hast sacrificed as Priest of
Earth, of Heaven,  
So with this offering bring the Gods, and prosper this sacrifice today
as erst for Manu.  
3 Three are thy times of life, O Jātavedas, and the three mornings are
thy births, O Agni.  
With these, well-knowing, grant the Gods’ kind favour, and help in stir
and stress the man who worships.  
4 Agni most bright and fair with song we honour, yea, the adorable, O
Jātavedas.  
Thee, envoy, messenger, oblation-bearer, the Gods have made centre of
life eternal.  
5 That Priest before thee, yet more skilled in worship, stablished of
old, health-giver by his nature,—  
After his custom offer, thou who knowest, and lay our sacrifice where
Gods may taste it.
