### HYMN XXVIII. Indra-Soma.

1\. ALLIED with thee, in this thy friendship, Soma, Indra for man made
waters flow together,  
Slew Ahi, and sent forth the Seven Rivers, and opened as it were
obstructed fountains.  
2 Indu, with thee for his confederate, Indra swiftly with might pressed
down the wheel of Sūrya.  
What rolled, all life's support, on heaven's high summit was separated
from the great oppressor.  
3 Indra smote down, Agni consumed, O Indu, the Dasyus ere the noontide
in the conflict.  
Of those who gladly sought a hard-won dwelling he cast down many a
thousand with his arrow.  
4 Lower than all besides hast thou, O Indra, cast down the Dasyus,
abject tribes of Dāsas.  
Ye drave away, ye put to death the foemen, and took great vengeance with
your murdering weapons.  
5 So, of a truth, Indra and Soma, Heroes, ye burst the stable of the
kine and horses,  
The stable which the bar or stone obstructed; and piercing through set
free the habitations.
