### HYMN XLIX. Indra.

1\. GREAT Indra will I laud, in whom all people who drink the Soma have
attained their longing;  
Whom, passing wise, Gods, Heaven and Earth, engendered, formed by a
Master's hand, to crush the Vṛtras.  
2 Whom, most heroic, borne by Tawny Coursers, verily none subdueth in
the battle;  
Who, reaching far, most vigorous, hath shortened the Dasyu's life with
Warriors bold of spirit.  
3 Victor in fight, swift mover like a warhorse, pervading both worlds,
rainer down of blessings,  
To he invoked in war like Bhaga, Father, as ’twere, of hymns, fair,
prompt to hear, strength-giver.  
4 Supporting heaven, the high back of the region, his car is Vāyu with
his team of Vasus.  
Illumining the nights, the Sun's creator, like Dhiṣaṇā he deals forth
strength and riches.  
5 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where
spoil is gathered;  
The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras,
wins and gathers treasure.
