### HYMN LXV. Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. WITH hymns I call you, when the Sun hath risen, Mitra, and Varuṇa
whose thoughts are holy,  
Whose Power Divine, supreme and everlasting, comes with good heed at
each man's supplication.  
2 For they are Asuras of Gods, the friendly make, both of you, our lands
exceeding fruitful.  
May we obtain you, Varuṇa and Mitra, wherever Heaven and Earth and days
may bless us.  
3 Bonds of the sinner, they bear many nooses: the wicked mortal hardly
may escape them.  
Varuṇa-Mitra, may your path of Order bear us o’er trouble as a boat o’er
waters.  
4 Come, taste our offering, Varuṇa and Mitra: bedew our pasture wil
sweet food and fatness.  
Pour down in plenty here upon the people the choicest of your fair
celestial water.  
5 To you this laud, O Varuṇa and Mitra, is offered, like bright Soma
juice to Vāyu.  
Favour our songs of praise, wake thought and spirit. Preserve us
evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
