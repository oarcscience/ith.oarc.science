### HYMN I. Agni

1\. Agni is wakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who cometh
like a milch-cow.  
Like young trees shooting up on high their branches, his flames are
rising to the vault of heaven.  
2 For worship of the Gods the Priest was wakened: at morning gracious
Agni hath arisen.  
Kindled, his radiant might is made apparent, and the great Deity set
free from darkness.  
3 When he hath stirred the line of his attendants, with the pure milk
pure Agni is anointed.  
The strength-bestowing gift is then made ready, which spread in front,
with tongues, erect, he drinketh.  
4 The spirits of the pious turn together to Agni, as the eyes of all to
Sūrya.  
He, when both Dawns of different hues have borne him, springs up at
daybreak as a strong white charger.  
5 The noble One was born at days' beginning, laid red in colour mid the
well-laid fuel.  
Yielding in every house his seven rich treasures, Agni is seated, Priest
most skilled in worship.  
6 Agni hath sat him down, a Priest most skilful, on a sweet-smelling
place, his Mother's bosom.  
Young, faithful, sage, preeminent o’er many, kindled among the folk whom
he sustaineth.  
7 This Singer excellent at sacrifices, Agni the Priest, they glorify
with homage.  
Him who spread out both worlds by Law Eternal they balm with oil, strong
Steed who never faileth.  
8. He, worshipful House-Friend, in his home is worshipped, our own
auspicious guest, lauded by sages.  
That strength the Bull with thousand horns possesses. In might, O Agni,
thou excellest others.  
9 Thou quickly passest by all others, Agni, for him to whom thou hast
appeared most lovely,  
Wondrously fair, adorable, effulgent, the guest of men, the darling of
the people.  
10 To thee, Most Youthful God! to thee, O Agni from near and far the
people bring their tribute.  
Mark well the prayer of him who best extols thee. Great, high,
auspicious, Agni, is thy shelter.  
11 Ascend to-day thy splendid car, O Agni, in splendour, with the Holy
Ones around it.  
Knowing the paths by mid-air's spacious region bring hither Gods to
feast on our oblation.  
12 To him adorable, sage, strong and mighty we have sung forth our song
of praise and homage.  
Gavisthira hath raised with prayer to Agni this laud far-reaching, like
gold light to heaven.
