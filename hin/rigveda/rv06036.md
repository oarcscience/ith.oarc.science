Heritage

### HYMN XXXVI. Indra.

1\. THY raptures ever were for all men's profit: so evermore have been
thine earthly riches.  
Thou still hast been the dealer-forth of vigour, since among Gods thou
hast had power and Godhead.  
2 Men have obtained his strength by sacrificing, and ever urged him, on
to hero valour.  
For the rein-seizing, the impetuous Charger they furnished power even
for Vṛtra's slaughter.  
3 Associate with him, as teams of horses, help, manly might, and vigour
follow Indra.  
As rivers reach the sea, so, strong with praises, our holy songs reach
him the Comprehensive.  
4 Lauded by us, let flow the spring, O Indra, of excellent and
brightly-shining riches.  
For thou art Lord of men, without an equal: of all the world thou art
the only Sovran.  
5 Hear what thou mayst hear, thou who, fain for worship, as heaven girds
earth, guardest thy servant's treasure;  
Tlat thou mayst be our own, joying in power, famed through thy might in
every generation.
