### HYMN LXXXI. Soma Pavamana.

1\. ONWARD to Indra's throat move, beauteously adorned, the waves of
Soma as he purifies himself,  
When they, brought forward with the lovely curd of kine, effused, have
cheered the Hero to bestow his gifts.  
2 Hither hath Soma flowed unto the beakers, like a chariot-horse, a
stallion swift upon his way.  
Thus, knowing both the generations, he obtains the rights and dues of
Gods from yonder and from hence.  
3 While thou art cleansed, O Soma, scatter wealth on us; Indu, bestow
great bounty as a liberal Prince.  
Giver of life, with wisdom help to opulence; strew not our home
possessions far away from us.  
4 Hither let Pūṣan Pavamana come to us, Varuṇa, Mitra, bountiful, of one
accord,  
The Maruts, Aśvins, Vāyu, and Bṛhaspati, Savitar, Tvaṣṭar, tractable
Sarasvatī.  
5 Both Heaven and Earth, the all-invigorating Pair, Vidhatar, Aditi, and
Aryaman the God,  
Bhaga who blesses men, the spacious Firmament,—let all the Gods in
Pavamana take delight.
