### HYMN XXIX. Viśvedevas.

1\. UPHOLDERS of the Law, ye strong Ādityas, remove my sin like her who
bears in secret.  
You, Varuṇa, Mitra and all Gods who listen, I call to help me, I who
know your goodness.  
2 Ye, Gods, are providence and ye are power: remove ye utterly all those
who hate us.  
As givers of good things deal with us kindly: this day be gracious to us
and hereafter.  
3 What service may we do you with our future, what service, Vasus, with
our ancient friendship?  
O Aditi, and Varuṇa and Mitra, Indra and Maruts, make us well and
happy.  
4 Ye, O ye Gods, are verily our kinsmen as such be kind to me who now
implore you.  
Let not your car come slowly to our worship: of kinsmen such as you
ne’er let us weary.  
5 I singly have sinned many a sin against you, and ye chastised me as a
sire the gambler.  
Far be your nets, far, Gods, be mine offences: seize me not like a bird
upon her offspring.  
6 Turn yourselves hitherward this day, ye Holy, that fearing in my heart
I may approach you.  
Protect us, God; let not the wolf destroy us. Save us, ye Holy, from the
pit and falling.  
7 May I not live, O Varuṇa, to witness my wealthy, liberal, dear
friend's destitution.  
King, may I never lack well-ordered riches. Loud may we speak, with
heroes, in assembly.
