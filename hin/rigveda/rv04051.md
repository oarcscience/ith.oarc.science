### HYMN LI. Dawn.

1\. FORTH from the darkness in the region eastward this most abundant
splendid light hatb mounted.  
Now verily the far-refulgent Mornings, Daughters of Heaven, bring
welfare to the people.  
2 The richly-coloured Dawns have mounted eastward, like pillars planted
at our sacrifices,  
And, flushing far, splendid and purifying, unbarred the portals of the
fold of darkness.  
3 Dispelling gloom this day the wealthy Mornings urge liberal givers to
present their treasures.  
In the unlightened depth of darkness round them let niggard traffickers
sleep unawakened.  
4 O Goddesses, is this your car, I ask you, ancient this day, or is it
new, ye Mornings,  
Wherewith, rich Dawns, ye seek with wealth Navagva, Daśagva Aṅgira, the
seven-toned singer?  
5 With horses harnessed by eternal Order, Goddesses, swiftly round the
worlds ye travel,  
Arousing from their rest, O Dawns, the sleeping, and all that lives,
man, bird, and beast, to motion.  
6 Which among these is eldest, and where is she through whom they fixed
the Ṛbhus' regulations?  
What time the splendid Dawns go forth for splendour, they are not known
apart, alike, unwasting.  
7 Blest were these Dawns of old, shining with succour, true with the
truth that springs from holy Order;  
With whom the toiling worshipper, by praises, hymning and lauding, soon
attained to riches.  
8 Hither from eastward all at once they travel, from one place spreading
in the selfsame manner.  
Awaking, from the seat of holy Order the Godlike Dawns come nigh like
troops of cattle.  
9 Thus they go forth with undiminished colours, these Mornings similar,
in self-same fashion,  
Concealing the gigantic might of darkness with radiant bodies bright and
pure and shining.  
10 O Goddesses, O Heaven's refulgent Daughters, bestow upon us wealth
with store of children.  
As from our pleasant place of rest ye rouse us may we be masters of
heroic vigour.  
11 Well-skilled in lore of sacrifice, ye Daughters of Heaven, refulgent
Dawns, I thus address you.  
May we be glorious among the people. May Heaven vouchsafe us this, and
Earth the Goddess,
