Heritage

### HYMN XIII. Agni.

1\. AGNI hath looked, benevolently-minded, on the wealth-giving spring
of radiant Mornings.  
Come, Aśvins, to the dwelling of the pious: Sūrya the God is rising with
his splendour.  
2 Savitar, God, hath spread on high his lustre, waving his flag like a
spoil-seeking hero.  
Their stablished way go Varuṇa and Mitra, what time they make the Sun
ascend the heaven.  
3 Him whom they made to drive away the darkness, Lords of sure mansions,
constant to their object,  
Him who beholds the universe, the Sun-God, seven strong and youthful
Coursers carry onward.  
4 Spreading thy web with mightiest Steeds thou comest, rending apart,
thou God, the black-hued mantle.  
The rays of Sūrya tremulously shining sink, like a hide, the darkness in
the waters.  
5 How is it that, unbound and not supported, he falleth not although
directed downward?  
By what self power moves he? Who hath seen it? He guards the vault of
heaven, a close-set pillar.
