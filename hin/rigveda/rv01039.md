### HYMN XXXIX Maruts.

1 WHEN thus, like flame, from far away, Maruts, ye cast your measure
forth,  
To whom go Ye, to whom, O shakers of the earth, moved by whose wisdom,
whose design?  
2 Strong let your weapons be to drive away your foes, firm for
resistance let them be.  
Yea, passing glorious must be your warrior might, not as a guileful
mortal's strength.  
3 When what is strong ye overthrow, and whirl about each ponderous
thing,  
Heroes, your course is through the forest trees of earth, and through
the fissures of the rocks.  
4 Consumers of your foes, no enemy of yours is found in heaven or on the
earth:  
Ye Rudras, may the strength, held in this bond, be yours, to bid
defiance even now.  
5 They make the mountains rock and reel, they rend the forest-kings
apart.  
Onward, ye Maruts, drive, like creatures drunk with wine, ye, Gods with
all your company.  
6 Ye to your chariot have yoked the spotted deer: a red deer, as a
leader, draws.  
Even the Earth herself listened as ye came near, and men were sorely
terrified.  
7 O Rudras, quickly we desire your succour for this work of ours.  
Come to us with your aid as in the days of old, so now for frightened
Kaṇva's sake.  
8 Should any monstrous foe, O Maruts, sent by you or sent by mortals
threaten us,  
Tear ye him from us with your power and with your might, and with the
succours that are yours.  
9 For ye, the worshipful and wise, have guarded Kaṇva perfectly.  
O Maruts, come to us with full protecting help, as lightning flashes
seek the rain.  
10 Whole strength have ye, O Bounteous Ones; perfect, earth-shakers, is
your might.  
Maruts, against the poet's wrathful enemy send ye an enemy like a dart.
