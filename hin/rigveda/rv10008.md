### HYMN VIII. Agni.

1\. AGNI advances with his lofty banner: the Bull is bellowing to the
earth and heavens.  
He hath attained the sky's supremest limits. the Steer hath waxen in the
lap of waters.  
2 The Bull, the youngling with the hump, hath frolicked, the strong and
never-ceasing Calf hath bellowed.  
Bringing our offerings to the God's assembly, he moves as Chief in his
own dwelling-places.  
3 Him who hath grasped his Parents' head, they stablished at sacrifice a
wave of heavenly lustre.  
In his swift flight the red Dawns borne by horses refresh their bodies
in the home of Order.  
4 For, Vasu thou precedest every Morning, and still hast been the Twins'
illuminator.  
For sacrifice, seven places thou retainest while for thine own self thou
engenderest Mitra.  
5 Thou art the Eye and Guard of mighty Order, and Varuṇa when to
sacrifice thou comest.  
Thou art the Waters’ Child O Jātavedas, envoy of him whose offering thou
acceptest.  
6 Thou art the Leader of the rite and region, to which with thine
auspicious teams thou teadest,  
Thy light-bestowing head to heaven thou liftest, making thy tongue the
oblationbearer, Agni.  
7 Through his wise insight Trita in the cavern, seeking as ever the
Chief Sire's intention,  
Carefully tended in his Parents' bosom, calling the weapons kin, goes
forth to combat.  
8 Well-skilled to use the weapons of his Father, Āptya, urged on by
Indra, fought the battle.  
Then Trita slew the foe seven-rayed, three-headed, and freed the cattle
of the Son of Tvaṣṭar.  
9 Lord of the brave, Indra cleft him in pieces who sought to gain much
strength and deemed him mighty.  
He smote his three heads from his body, seizing the cattle of the
oniniform Son of Tvaṣṭar.
