*Rig Veda*, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, \[1896\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### HYMN XLII. Indra.

1\. BRING sacrificial gifts to him, Omniscient, for he longs to drink,  
The Wanderer who comes with speed, the Hero ever in the van.  
2 With Soma go ye nigh to him chief drinker of the Soma's juice:  
With beakers to the Impetuous God, to Indra with the drops effused.  
3 What time, with Soma, with the juice effused, ye come before the
God,  
Full wise he knows the hope of each, and, Bold One, strikes this foe and
that.  
4 To him, Adhvaryu! yea, to him give offerings of the juice expressed.  
Will he not keep us safely from the spiteful curse of each presumptuous
high-born foe?
