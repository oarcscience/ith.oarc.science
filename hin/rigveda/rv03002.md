### HYMN II. Agni.

1\. To him, Vaiśvānara, who strengthens Holy Law, to Agni we present our
praise like oil made pure.  
With thoughtful insight human priests bring him anear, our Herald from
of old, as an axe forms a car.  
2 He made the heaven and earth resplendent by his birth: Child of two
Mothers he was meet to be implored,  
Agni, oblation-bearer, gracious, ever-young, infallible, rich in radiant
light, the guest of men.  
3 Within the range of their surpassinq power, by might, the Gods created
Agni with inventive thought.  
I, eager to win strength, address him, like a steed, resplendent with
his brilliance, with his ample light.  
4 Eager to gain, we crave from him the friendly God strength confident,
choiceworthy meet to be extolled:  
The Bhṛgus' bounty, willing, strong with sages' lore, even Agni shining
forth with light that comes from heaven.  
5 For happiness, men, having trimmed the sacred grass, set Agni glorious
for his strength before them here;  
Yea, with raised ladles, him bright, dear to all the Gods, perfecting
aims of works, Rudra of solemn rites.  
6 Around thy dwelling-place, O brightly-shining Priest, are men at
sacrifice, whose sacred grass is trimmed.  
Wishing to do thee service, Agni, they are there, desirous of thy
friendship grant them store of wealth.  
7 He hath filled heaven and earth and the great realm of light, when at
his birth the skilful held him in their hold.  
He like a horse is led forth to the sacrifice Sage, graciously inclined,
that he may win us strength.  
8 Honour the oblation-bearer, him who knows fair rites, serve ye the
Household Friend who knows all things that be.  
He drives the chariot of the lofty ordinance: Agni most active, is the
great High Priest of Gods.  
9 They who are free from death, fain for him, purified three splendours
of the mighty Agni, circling all.  
To man, for his enjoyment, one of these they gave: the other two have
passed into the sister sphere.  
10 Man's sacrificial food hath sharpened like an axe, for brightness,
him the Sage of men, the people's Lord,  
Busied with sacred rites he mounts and he descends. He hath laid down
his vital germ within these worlds.  
11 He stirs with life in wombs dissimilar in kind, born as a Lion or a
loudly-bellowing Bull:  
Vaiśvānara immortal with wide-reaching might, bestowing goods and wealth
on him who offiers gifts.  
12 Vaiśvānara, as of old, mounted the cope of heaven, heaven's ridge,
well greeted, by those skilled in noble songs.  
He, as of old, producing riches for the folk, still watchful,
traversesthe common way again.  
13 For new prosperity we seek to Agni, him whose course is splendid,
gold-haired, excellently bright,  
Whom Mātariśvan stablished, dweller in the heaven, meet for high praise
and holy, sage and true to Law.  
14 As pure and swift of course, beholder of the light, who stands in
heaven's bright sphere a sign, who wakes at dawn,  
Agni, the head of heaven, whom none may turn aside-to him the Powerful
with mighty prayer we seek.  
15 The cheerful Priest, the pure, in whom no guile is found, Friend of
the House, praise-worthy, dear to all mankind,  
Fair to behold for beauty like a splendid car,—Agni the Friend of men we
ever seek for wealth.
