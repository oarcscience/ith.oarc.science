### HYMN LIII. Indra.

1\. MAY our hymns give thee great delight. Display thy bounty,
Thunderer.  
Drive off the enemies of prayer.  
2 Crush with thy foot the niggard churls who bring no gifts. Mighty art
thou  
There is not one to equal thee.  
3 Thou art the Lord of Soma pressed, Soma impressed is also thine.  
Thou art the Sovran of the folk.  
4 Come, go thou forth, dwelling in heaven and listening to the prayers
of men:  
Thou fillest both the heavens and earth.  
5 Even that hill with rocky heights, with hundreds, thousands, held
within.  
Thou for thy worshippers brakest through.  
6 We call on thee both night and day to taste the flowing Soma juice:  
Do thou fulfil our heart's desire.  
7 Where is that ever-youthful Steer, strong. necked and never yet bent
down?  
What Brahman ministers to him?  
8 To whose libation doth the Steer, betake him with delight therein?  
Who takes delight in Indra now?  
9 Whom, Vṛtra-slayer, have thy gift and hero powers accompanied?  
Who is thy dearest in the laud?  
10 For thee among mankind, among the Pūrus is this Soma shed.  
Hasten thou hither: drink thereof.  
11 This, growing by Soma and by Śaryaṇāvān, dear to thee,  
In Ārjīkīya, cheers thee best.  
12 Hasten thou hitherward, and drink this for munificence to-day,  
Delightful for thine eager draught.
