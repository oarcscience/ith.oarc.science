### HYMN XXIX. Indra.

1 O SOMA DRINKER, ever true, utterly hopeless though we be,  
Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine,  
In thousands, O most wealthy One.  
2 O Lord of Strength, whose jaws are strong, great deeds are thine, the
powerful:  
Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine,  
In thousands, O most wealthy One.  
3 Lull thou asleep, to wake no more, the pair who on each other look  
Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine,  
In thousands, O most wealthy One.  
4 Hero, let hostile spirits sleep, and every gentler genius wake:  
Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine,  
In thousands, O most wealthy One.  
5 Destroy this ass, O Indra, who in tones discordant brays to thee:  
Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine,  
In thousands, O most wealthy One.  
6 Far distant on the forest fall the tempest in a circling course!  
Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine,  
In thousands, O most wealthy One.  
7 Slay each reviler, and destroy him who in secret injures us:  
Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine  
In thousands, O most wealthy One.
