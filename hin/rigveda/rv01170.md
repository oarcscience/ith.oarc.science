### HYMN CLXX. Indra. Maruts.

1\. NAUGHT is to-day, to-morrow naught. Who comprehends the mystery?  
We must address ourselves unto another's thought, and lost is then the
hope we formed.  
2 The Maruts are thy brothers. Why, O Indra, wouldst thou take our
lives?  
Agree with them in friendly wise, and do not slay us in the fight.  
3 Agastya, brother, why dost thou neglect us, thou who art our friend?  
We know the nature of thy mind. Verity thou wilt give us naught.  
4 Let them prepare the altar, let them kindle fire in front: we two  
Here will spread sacrifice for thee, that the Immortal may observe.  
5 Thou, Lord of Wealth, art Master of all treasures, thou, Lord of
friends, art thy friends' best supporter.  
O Indra, speak thou kindly with the Maruts, and taste oblations in their
proper season.
