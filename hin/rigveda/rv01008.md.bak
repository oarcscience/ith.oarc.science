### HYMN VIII. Indra.

1 INDRA, bring wealth that gives delight, the victor's ever-conquering
wealth,  
Most excellent, to be our aid;  
2 By means of which we may repel our foes in battle hand to hand,  
By thee assisted with the car.  
3 Aided by thee, the thunder-armed, Indra, may we lift up the bolt,  
And conquer all our foes in fight.  
4 With thee, O India, for ally with missile-darting heroes, may  
We conquer our embattled foes.  
5 Mighty is Indra, yea supreme; greatness be his, the Thunderer:  
Wide as the heaven extends his power  
6 Which aideth those to win them sons, who come as heroes to the
fight,  
Or singers loving holy thoughts.  
7 His belly, drinking deepest draughts of Soma, like an ocean swells,  
Like wide streams from the cope of heaven.  
8 So also is his excellence, great, vigorous, rich in cattle, like  
A ripe branch to the worshipper.  
9 For verily thy mighty powers, Indra, are saving helps at once  
Unto a worshipper like me.  
10 So are his lovely gifts; let lauds and praises be to Indra sung,  
That he may drink the Soma juice.
