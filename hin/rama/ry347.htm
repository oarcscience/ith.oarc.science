<P>
The guardian goddess thus subdued.<BR>
The Vanar chief his way pursued,<BR>
And reached the broad imperial street<BR>
Where fresh-blown flowers were bright and sweet.<BR>
The city seemed a fairer sky<BR>
Where cloud-like houses rose on high,<BR>
Whence the soft sound of tabors came<BR>
Through many a latticed window frame,<BR>
And ever and anon rang out<BR>
The merry laugh and joyous shout.<BR>
From house to house the Vanar went<BR>
And marked each varied ornament,<BR>
Where leaves aud blossoms deftly strung<BR>
About the crystal columns hung.<BR>
Then soft and full and sweet and clear<BR>
The song of women charmed his ear,<BR>
And, blending with their dulcet tones,<BR>
Their anklets' chime and tinkling zones.<BR>
He heard the Rakshas minstrel sing<BR>
The praises of their matchless king;<BR>
And softly through the evening air<BR>
Came murmurings of text and prayer,<BR>
Here moved a priest with tonsured head,<BR>
And there an eager envoy sped,<BR>
Mid crowds with hair in matted twine<BR>
Clothed in the skins of deer and kine,--<BR>
Whose only arms, which none might blame,<BR>
Were blades of grass and holy flame &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_809"></A><A HREF="#fn_809"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
There savage warriors roamed in bands<BR>
With clubs and maces in their bauds,<BR>
Some dwarfish forms, some huge of size.<BR>
With single ears and single eyes.<BR>
Some shone in glittering mail arrayed<BR>
With bow and mace and flashing blade;<BR>
Fiends of all shapes and every hue,<BR>
Some fierce and foul, some fair to view.<BR>

<P>
He saw the grisly legions wait<BR>
In strictest watch at R&aacute;van's gate,<BR>
Whose palace on the mountain crest<BR>
Rose proudly towering o'er the rest,<BR>
Fenced with high ramparts from the foe,<BR>
And lotus-covered moats below.<BR>
But Hanuman, unhindered, found<BR>
Quick passage through the guarded bound,<BR>
Mid elephants of noblest breed,<BR>
And gilded car and neighing steed.<BR>
