### CANTO LVI.: SAMPÁTI.

Then came the vultures' mighty king  
Where sat the Vánars sorrowing,--  
Sampáti,  <span id="fr_763"></span>[2](#fn_763.md) best of birds that fly  
On sounding pinions through the sky,  
Jatáyus' brother, famed of old,  
Most glorious and strong and bold.  
Upon the slope of Vindhya's hill  
He saw the Vánars calm and still.  

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>  

These words he uttered while the sight  
Filled his fierce spirit with delight:  
'Behold how Fate with changeless laws  
Within his toils the sinner draws,  
And brings me, after long delay,  
A rich and noble feast to-day,  
These Vánars who are doomed to die  
My hungry maw to satisfy.'  
   He spoke no more: and Angad heard  
The menace of the mighty bird;  
And thus, while anguish filled his breast,  
The noble Hanumán addressed:  
'Vivasvat's  <span id="fr_764"></span>[1](#fn_764.md) son has sought this
place  
For vengeance on the Vánar race.  
See, Yama, wroth for Sítá's sake,  
Is come our guilty lives to take.  
Our king's decree is left undone,  
And naught achieved for Raghu's son.  
In duty have we failed, and hence  
Comes punishment for dire offence.  
Have we not heard the marvels wrought  
By King Jatáyus,  <span id="fr_765"></span>[2](#fn_765.md) how he fought  
With Rávan's might, and, nobly brave,  
Perished, the Maithil queen to save?  
There is no living creature, none,  
But loves to die for Raghu's son,  
And in long toils and dangers we  
Have placed our lives in jeopardy  
Blest is Jatáyus, he who gave  
His life the Maithil queen to save,  
And proved his love for Ráma well  
When by the giant's hand he fell  
Now raised to bliss and high renown  
He fears not fierce Sugríva's frown.  
Alas, alas! what miseries spring  
From that rash promise of the king!  <span
id="fr_766"></span>[3](#fn_766.md)  
His own sad death, and Ráma sent  
With Lakshman forth to banishment:  
The Maithil lady borne away:  
Jatáyus slain in mortal fray:  
The fall of Báli when the dart  
Of Ráma quivered in his heart:  
And, after toil and pain and care,  
Our misery and deep despair.'  
   He ceased: the feathered monarch heard,  
His heart with ruth and wonder stirred:  
'Whose is that voice,' the vulture cried,  
'That tells me how Jatáyus died,  
And shakes my inmost soul with woe  
For a loved brother's overthrow?  
After long days at length I hear  
The glorious name of one so dear.  
Once more, O Vánar chieftains, tell  
How King Jatáyus fought and fell.  

But first your aid, I pray you, lend,  
And from this peak will I descend.  
The sun has burnt my wings, and I  
No longer have the power to fly.'
