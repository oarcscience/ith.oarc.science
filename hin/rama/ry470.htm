<P>
The shades of falling night concealed<BR>
The carnage of the battle field,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_485"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 485</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Which, hearing each a blazing brand,<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n and Vibh&iacute;shan scanned,<BR>
Moving with slow and anxious tread<BR>
Among the dying and the dead.<BR>
Sad was the scene of slaughter shown<BR>
Where'er the torches' light was thrown.<BR>
Here mountain forma of V&aacute;nars lay<BR>
Whose heads and limbs were lopped away<BR>
Arms legs and fingers strewed the ground,<BR>
And severed heads lay thick around.<BR>
The earth was moist with sanguine streams,<BR>
And sighs were heard and groans and screams.<BR>
There lay Sugr&iacute;va still and cold,<BR>
There Angad, once so brave and bold.<BR>
There J&aacute;mbav&aacute;n his might reposed,<BR>
There Vegadars'&iacute;'s eyes were closed;<BR>
There in the dust was Nala's pride,<BR>
And Dwivid lay by Mainda's side.<BR>
Where'er they looked the ensanguined plain<BR>
Was strewn with myriads of the slain;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1007"></A><A HREF="#fn_1007"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
They sought with keenly searching eyes<BR>
King J&aacute;mbav&aacute;n supremely wise.<BR>
His strength had failed by slow decay,<BR>
And pierced with countless shafts he lay.<BR>
They saw, and hastened to his side,<BR>
And thus the sage Vibh&iacute;shan cried:<BR>
'Thee, monarch of the bears, we seek:<BR>
Speak if thou yet art living, speak.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Slow came the aged chief's reply;<BR>
Scarce could he say with many a sigh:<BR>
'Torn with keen shafts which pierce each limb,<BR>
My strength is gone, my sight is dim;<BR>
Yet though I scarce can raise mine eyes.<BR>
Thy voice. O chief. I recognize.<BR>
O, while these ears can hear thee, say,<BR>
Has Hanum&aacute;n survived this day?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Why ask,' Vibh&iacute;shan cried,' for one<BR>
Of lower rank, the Wind-God's son?<BR>
Hast thou forgotten, first in place,<BR>
The princely chief of Raghu's race?<BR>
Can King Sugr&iacute;va claim no care,<BR>
And Angad, his imperial heir?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Yea, dearer than my noblest friends<BR>
Is he on whom our hope depends.<BR>
For if the Wind-God's son survive,<BR>
All we though dead are yet alive.<BR>
But if his precious life be fled<BR>
Though living still we are but dead:<BR>
He is our hope and sure relief.'<BR>
Thus slowly spoke the aged chief:<BR>
Then to his side Han&uacute;m&aacute;n came,<BR>
And with low reverence named his name.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Cheered by the face he longed to view<BR>
The wounded chieftain lived anew.<BR>
'Go forth,' he cried, 'O strong and brave,<BR>
And in their woe the V&aacute;nars save.<BR>
'No might but thine, supremely great,<BR>
May help us in our lost estate,<BR>
The trembling bears and V&aacute;nars cheer,<BR>
Calm their sad hearts, dispel their fear.<BR>
Save Raghu's noble sons, and heal<BR>
The deep wounds of the winged steel.<BR>
High o'er the waters of the sea<BR>
To far Him&aacute;laya's summits flee.<BR>
Kail&aacute;sa there wilt thou behold,<BR>
Aud Rishabh, with his peaks of gold.<BR>
Between them see a mountain rise<BR>
Whose splendour will enchant thine eyes;<BR>
His sides are clothed above, below,<BR>
With all the rarest herbs that grow.<BR>
Upon that mountain's lofty crest<BR>
Four plants, of sovereign powers possessed,<BR>
Spring from the soil, and flashing there<BR>
Shed radiance through the neighbouring air.<BR>
One draws the shaft: one brings again<BR>
The breath of life to warm the slain;<BR>
One heals each wound; one gives anew<BR>
To faded cheeks their wonted hue.<BR>
Fly, chieftain, to that mountain's brow<BR>
And bring those herbs to save us now.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Han&uacute;m&aacute;n heard, and springing through<BR>
The air like Vishnu's discus &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1008"></A><A HREF="#fn_1008"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> flew.<BR>
The sea was passed: beneath him, gay<BR>
With bright-winged birds, the mountains lay,<BR>
And brook and lake and lonely glen,<BR>
And fertile lands with toiling men.<BR>
On, on he sped: before him rose<BR>
The mansion of perennial snows.<BR>
There soared the glorious peaks as fair<BR>
As white clouds in the summer air.<BR>
Here, bursting from the leafy shade,<BR>
In thunder leapt the wild cascade.<BR>
He looked on many a pure retreat<BR>
Dear to the Gods' and sages' feet:<BR>
The spot where Brahm&aacute; dwells apart,<BR>
The place whence Rudra launched his dart; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1009"></A><A HREF="#fn_1009"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
Vishnu's high seat and Indra's home,<BR>
And slopes where Yama's servants roam.<BR>
There was Kuvera's bright abode;<BR>
There Brahma's mystic weapon glowed.<BR>
There was the noble hill whereon<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_486"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 486</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Those herbs with wondrous lustre shone.<BR>
And, ravished by the glorious sight,<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n rested on the height.<BR>
He, moving down the glittering peak,<BR>
The healing herbs began to seek:<BR>
But, when he thought to seize the prize,<BR>
They hid them from his eager eyes.<BR>
Then to the hill in wrath he spake:<BR>
'Mine arm this day shall vengeance take,<BR>
If thou wilt feel no pity, none,<BR>
In this great need of Raghu's son.'<BR>
He ceased: his mighty arms he bent<BR>
And from the trembling mountain rent<BR>
His huge head with the life it bore,<BR>
Snakes, elephants, and golden ore.<BR>
O'er hill and plain and watery waste<BR>
His rapid way again he traced.<BR>
And mid the wondering V&aacute;nars laid<BR>
His burthen through the air conveyed.<BR>
The wondrous herbs' delightful scent<BR>
To all the host new vigour lent.<BR>
Free from all darts and wounds and pain<BR>
The sons of Raghu lived again,<BR>
And dead and dying V&aacute;nars healed<BR>
Rose vigorous from the battle field.<BR>
