### CANTO L.: PRAHASTA'S QUESTIONS.

Then fierce the giant's fury blazed  
As on Hanúmán's form he gazed,  
And shaken by each wild surmise  
He spake aloud with flashing eyes:  
'Can this be Nandi  <span id="fr_889"></span>[2b](#fn_889.md) standing
here,  
The mighty one whom all revere?  
Who once on high Kailása's hill  
Pronounced the curse that haunts me still?  
Or is the woodland creature one  
Of Asur race, or Bali's  <span id="fr_890"></span>[3b](#fn_890.md) son?  
The wretch with searching question try:  
Learn who he is, and whence; and why  
He marred the glory of the grove,  
And with my captains fiercely strove.'  

<span id="page_422">p. 422</span>  

Prahasta heard his lord's behest,  
And thus the Vánar chief addressed:  
'O monkey stranger, be consoled:  
Fear not, and let thy heart be bold.  
If thou by Indra's mandate sent  
Thy steps to Lanká's isle hast bent,  
With fearless words the cause explain,  
And freedom thou shalt soon regain.  
Or if thou comest as a spy  
Despatched by Vishnu in the sky,  
Or sent by Yama, or the Lord  
Of Riches, hast our town explored;  
Proved by the prowess thou hast shown  
No monkey save in form alone;  
Speak boldly all the truth, and be  
Released from bonds, unharmed and free.  
But falsehood spoken to our king  
Swift punishment of death will bring.'  

He ceased: the Vánar made reply;  
'Not Indra's messenger am I,  
Nor came I hither to fulfil  
Kuvera's hest or Vishnu's will.  
I stand before the giants here  
A Vánar e'en as I appear.  
I longed to see the king--'twas hard  
To win my way through gate and guard.  
And so to gain my wish I laid  
In ruin that delightful shade  
No fiend, no God of heavenly kind  
With bond or chain these herbs may bind.  
The Eternal Sire himself of old  
Vouchsafed the boon that makes me bold,  
From Brahmá's magic shaft released  <span
id="fr_891"></span>[1](ry389.htm#fn_891.md)  
I knew the captor's power had ceased,  
The fancied bonds I freely brooked,  
And thus upon the king have looked.  
My way to Lanká have I won,  
A messenger from Raghu's son.'

thirds of his dominions by Vishnu in the Dwarf incarnation.
