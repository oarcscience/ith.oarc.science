<P>
When Vishnu thus had gone on earth.<BR>
From the great king to take his birth.<BR>
The self-existent Lord of all<BR>
Addressed the Gods who heard his call:<BR>
'For Vishnu's sake, the strong and true.<BR>
Who seeks the good of all of you,<BR>
Make helps, in war to lend him aid,<BR>
In forms that change at will, arrayed,<BR>
Of wizard skill and hero might,<BR>
Outstrippers of the wind in flight,<BR>
Skilled in the arts of counsel, wise,<BR>
And Vishnu's peers in bold emprise;<BR>
With heavenly arts and prudence fraught,<BR>
By no devices to be caught;<BR>
Skilled in all weapon's lore and use<BR>
As they who drink the immortal juice.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>

And let the nymphs supreme in grace,<BR>
And maidens of the minstrel race,<BR>
Monkeys and snakes,and those who rove<BR>
Free spirits of the hill and grove,<BR>
And wandering Daughters of the Air,<BR>
In monkey form brave children bear.<BR>
So erst the lord of bears I shaped,<BR>
Born from my mouth as wide I gaped.'<BR>

<P>
Thus by the mighty Sire addressed<BR>
They all obeyed his high behest,<BR>
And thus begot in countless swarms<BR>
Brave sons disguised in sylvan forms.<BR>
Each God, each sage became a sire,<BR>
Each minstrel of the heavenly quire,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Each faun,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of children strong and good<BR>
Whose feet should roam the hill and wood.<BR>
Snakes, bards,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and spirits,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> serpents bold<BR>
Had sons too numerous to be told.<BR>
B&aacute;li, the woodland hosts who led,<BR>
High as Mahendra's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> lofty head,<BR>
Was Indra's child. That noblest fire,<BR>
The Sun, was great Sugr&iacute;va's sire,<BR>
T&aacute;ra, the mighty monkey, he<BR>
Was offspring of Vrihaspati:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A><BR>
T&aacute;ra the matchless chieftain, boast<BR>
For wisdom of the V&aacute;nar host.<BR>
Of Gandham&aacute;dan brave and bold<BR>
The father was the Lord of Gold.<BR>
Nala the mighty, dear to fame,<BR>
Of skilful Vis'vakarm&aacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> came.<BR>
From Agni,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> Nila bright as flame,<BR>
Who in his splendour, might, and worth,<BR>
Surpassed the sire who gave him birth.<BR>

The heavenly As'vlns,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> swift and fair,<BR>
Were fathers of a noble pair,<BR>
Who, Dwivida and Mainda named,<BR>
For beauty like their sires were famed,<BR>
Varun&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> was father of Sushen,<BR>
Of Sarabh, he who sends the rain,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A><BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n, best of monkey kind,<BR>
Was son of him who breathes the wind:<BR>
Like thunderbolt in frame was he,<BR>
And swift as Garud's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">4b</FONT></A> self could flee.<BR>
These thousands did the Gods create<BR>
Endowed with might that none could mate,<BR>
In monkey forms that changed at will;<BR>
So strong their wish the fiend to kill.<BR>
In mountain size, like lions thewed,<BR>
Up sprang the wondrous multitude,<BR>
Auxiliar hosts in every shape,<BR>
Monkey and bear and highland ape.<BR>
In each the strength, the might, the mien<BR>
Of his own parent God were seen.<BR>
Some chiefs of V&aacute;nar mothers came,<BR>
Some of she-bear and minstrel dame,<BR>
Skilled in all arms in battle's shock;<BR>
The brandished tree, the loosened rock;<BR>
And prompt, should other weapons fail,<BR>
To fight and slay with tooth and nail.<BR>
Their strength could shake the hills amain,<BR>
And rend the rooted trees in twain,<BR>
Disturb with their impetuous sweep<BR>
The Rivers' Lord, the Ocean deep,<BR>
Rend with their feet the seated ground,<BR>
And pass wide floods with airy bound,<BR>
Or forcing through the sky their way<BR>
The very clouds by force could stay.<BR>
Mad elephants that wander through<BR>
The forest wilds, could they subdue,<BR>
And with their furious shout could scare<BR>
Dead upon earth the birds of air.<BR>
So were the sylvan chieftains formed;<BR>
Thousands on thousands still they swarmed.<BR>
These were the leaders honoured most,<BR>
The captains of the V&aacute;nar host,<BR>
And to each lord and chief and guide<BR>
Was monkey offspring born beside.<BR>
Then by the bears' great monarch stood<BR>
The other roamers of the wood,<BR>

And turned, their pathless homes to seek,<BR>
To forest and to mountain peak.<BR>
The leaders of the monkey band<BR>
By the two brothers took their stand,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, offspring of the Sun.<BR>
And B&aacute;li, Indra's mighty one.<BR>
They both endowed with Garud's might,<BR>
And skilled in all the arts of fight,<BR>
Wandered in arms the forest through,<BR>
And lions, snakes, and tigers, slew.<BR>
But every monkey, ape, and bear<BR>
Ever was B&aacute;li's special care;<BR>
With his vast strength and mighty arm<BR>
He kept them from all scathe and harm.<BR>
And so the earth with hill, wood, seas,<BR>
Was filled with mighty ones like these,<BR>
Of various shape and race and kind,<BR>
With proper homes to each assigned,<BR>
With R&aacute;ma's champions fierce and strong<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The earth was overspread,<BR>
High as the hills and clouds, a throng<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With bodies vast and dread.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="ry019.htm#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
