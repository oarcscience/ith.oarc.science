### CANTO XL.: RÁVAN'S SPEECH.

But Rávan soorned the rede he gave  
In timely words to warn and save,  
E'en as the wretch who hates to live  
Rejects the herb the leeches give.  
By fate to sin and ruin spurred,  
That sage advice the giant heard,  
Then in reproaches hard and stern  
Thus to Márícha spoke in turn:  
   'Is this thy counsel, weak and base,  
Unworthy of thy giant race?  
Thy speech is fruitless, vain, thy toil  
Like casting seed on barren soil.  
No words of thine shall drive me back  
From Ráma and the swift attack.  
A fool is he, inured to sin.  
And more, of human origin.  
The craven, at a woman's call  
To leave his sire, his mother, all  
The friends he loved, the power and sway.  
And hasten to the woods away!  
But now his anger will I rouse,  
Stealing away his darling spouse.  
I in thy sight will ravish her  
From Khara's cruel murderer.  
Upon this plan my soul is bent,  
And naught shall move my firm intent,  
Not if the way through demons led  
And Gods with Indra at their head.  
'Tis thine, when questioned, to explain  
The hope and fear, the loss and gain,  
And, when thy king thy thoughts would know,  
The triumph or the danger show.  
A prudent counsellor should wait,  
And speak when ordered in debate,  
With hands uplifted, calm and meek,  
If honour and reward he seek.  
Or, when some prudent course he sees  
Which, spoken, may his king displease  

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>  

He should by hints of dexterous art  
His counsel to his lord impart.  
But prudent words are said in vain  
When the blunt speech brings grief and pain.  
A high-souled king will scarcely thank  
The man who shames his royal rank.  
Five are the shapes that kings assume,  
Of majesty, of grace, and gloom:  
Like Indra now, or Agni, now  
Like the dear Moon, with placid brow:  
Like mighty Varun now they show,  
Now fierce as He who rules below.  
O giant, monarchs lofty-souled  
Are kind and gentle, stern and bold,  
With gracious love their gifts dispense  
And swiftly punish each offence.  
Thus subjects should their rulers view  
With all respect and honour due.  
But folly leads thy heart to slight  
Thy monarch and neglect his right.  
Thou hast in lawless pride addressed  
With bitter words thy royal guest.  
I asked thee not my strength to scan,  
Or \[\*} and profit in the plan.  
I only spoke to tell the deed  
O mighty one, by me decreed,  
And bid thee in the peril lend  
Thy succour in support thy friend.  
Hear me again, and I will tell  
How thou canst aid my venture well.  
In semblance of a golden deer  
Adorned with silver drops, appear:  
And near the cottage in the way  
Of Ráma and his consort stray.  
Draw nigh, and wandering through the brake  
With thy strange form her fancy take.  
The Maithil dame with wondering eyes  
Will took upon thy fair disguise,  
And quickly bid her husband go  
And bring the deer that charms her so,  
When Raghu's son has left the place,  
Still pressing onward in the chase,  
Cry out, 'O Lakshman! Ah, mine own!'  
With voice resembling Ráma's tone.  
When Lakshman hears his brother's cry,  
Impelled by Sitá he will fly,  
Restless with eager love, to aid  
The hunter in the distant shade.  
When both her guards have left her side,  
Even as Indra, thousand-eyed,  
Clasps Sachi, will I bear away  
The Maithil dame an easy prey.  
When thou, my friend, this aid hast lent,  
Go where thou wilt and live content.  
True servant, faithful to thy vow,  
With \[\*half?} my realm I thee endow.  
Go forth, may luck thy way attend  
That leads thee to the happy end.  
\[I:ii m.,ir v}, will quickly be  

In Dandak wood, and follow thee.  
So will I cheat this Ráma's eyes  
And win without a blow the prize;  
And safe return to Lanká's town  
With thee, my friend, this day shall crown.  
But if thou wilt not aid my will,  
My band this day thy blood shall spill.  
Yea, thou must share the destined task,  
For force will take the help I ask.  
No bliss that rebel's life attends  
Whose stubborn will his lord offends.  
   Thy life, if thou the task assay,  
     jeopardy may stand;  
   Oppose me, and this very day  
     Thou diest by this hand.  
   Now ponder all that thou hast heard  
     Within thy prudent breast:  
   Reflect with care on every word,  
     And do what seems the best.'
