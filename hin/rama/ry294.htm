<P>
Again she bent her to the ground,<BR>
Her arms about her husband wound.<BR>
Sobbed on his breast, and sick and faint<BR>
With anguish poured her wild complaint:<BR>
Brave in the charge of battle, boast<BR>
And glory of the V&aacute;nar host,<BR>
Why on the cold earth wilt thou lie<BR>
And give no answer when I cry!<BR>
Up, warrior, from thy lowly bed!<BR>
A meeter couch for thee is spread.<BR>
It ill beseems a glorious king<BR>
On the bare ground his limbs to fling.<BR>
Ah, surely must thy love be strong<BR>
For her whom thou hast governed long,<BR>
If thou, my hero, canst recline<BR>
On her cold breast forsaking mine.<BR>
Or, famed for justice through the laud.<BR>
Thou on the road to heaven hast planned<BR>
Some city fairer far than this<BR>
To be thy new metropolis.<BR>
Are all our plasures ended now.<BR>
With those delicious hours which thou<BR>
And I, dear lord, together spent<BR>
In woods that breathed the honey's scent?<BR>
Whelmed in my sorrow's boundless sea,<BR>
There is no joy, no hope, for me,<BR>
When my beloved lord, who led<BR>
The V&aacute;nars to the fight, is dead,<BR>
My widowed heart is stern and cold.<BR>
Or, at the sight mine eyes behold,<BR>
O'ermastered would it end this ache<BR>
And in a thousand fragments break.<BR>
Ah noble V&aacute;nar, doomed to pay<BR>
The penalty of all today--<BR>
Sugriva from his home expelled.<BR>
And Rum&aacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_602"></A><A HREF="#fn_602"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> from his arms withheld.<BR>
Our V&aacute;nar race and thee to save.<BR>
Wise counsel for thy weal I gave;<BR>
But thou, by wildest folly stirred,<BR>
Wouldst give no credence to my word.<BR>
And now wilt woo the nymphs above.<BR>
And shake their souls with pangs of love.<BR>
Ah, never could it be that thou<BR>
Beneath Sugriva's power shouldst bow,<BR>
Thy conqueror is none but Fate<BR>
Whose mandates all who breathe await.<BR>
And does no thrill of anguish run<BR>
Through the stern breast of Raghu's son,<BR>
Whose base hand dealt a coward's blow,<BR>
And smote thee fighting with thy foe!<BR>
Reft of my lord my days, alas!<BR>

<P>
In bitter bitter woe will pass:<BR>
And I, long blest-with every good,<BR>
Must bear my dreary widowhood.<BR>
And when his uncle's brow is stern,<BR>
When his fierce eyes with fury burn,<BR>
Ah, what will be my Angad's fate,<BR>
So fair and young and delicate?<BR>
Come, darling, for the last sad sight,<BR>
Of thy dear sire who loved the right;<BR>
For soon thine eyes will long in vain<BR>
A look at that loved face to gain.<BR>
And, hero, as thy child draws near,<BR>
With tender words his spirit cheer;<BR>
Thy dying wishes gently speak,<BR>
And kiss him on the brows and cheek.<BR>
High fame, I ween, has R&aacute;ma won<BR>
By this great deed his hand has done,<BR>
His debt to brave Sugr&iacute;va paid<BR>
And kept the promise that he made.<BR>
Be happy, King Sugr&iacute;va, lord<BR>
Of Rum&aacute; to thine arms restored:<BR>
Enjoy uninterrupted reign,<BR>
For he, thy foe, at length is slain.<BR>
Dost thou not hear me speak, and why<BR>
Hast thou no word of soft reply?<BR>
Will thou not lift thine eyes and see<BR>
These dames who look to none but thee?'<BR>

<P>
From their sad eyes, as T&aacute;r&aacute; spoke,<BR>
The floods of bitter sorrow broke:<BR>
Then, pressing close to Angad's side,<BR>
Each lifted up her voice and cried:<BR>

<P>
How couldst thou leave thine Angad thus,<BR>
And go, for ever go, from us--<BR>
Thy child so dear in brave attire,<BR>
Graced with the virtues of his sire?<BR>
If e'er in want of thought, O chief,<BR>
One deed of mine have caused thee grief,<BR>
Forgive my folly, I entreat,<BR>
And with my head I touch thy feet.'<BR>

<P>
Again the hapless T&aacute;r&aacute; wept<BR>
As to her husband's side she crept,<BR>
And wild with sorrow and dismay<BR>
Sat on the ground where B&aacute;l&iacute; lay.<BR>
