### CANTO XXXVI.: RÁVAN'S REPLY.

But Rávan's breast with fury swelled,  
And thus he spake by Death impelled,  
While, under brows in anger bent,  
Fierce glances from his eyes were sent:  
'The bitter words which thou, misled  
By friendly thought, hast fondly said,  
Which praise the foe and counsel fear,  
Unheeded fall upon mine ear.  
How canst thou deem a mighty foe  
This Ráma who, in stress of woe,  
Seeks, banished as his sire decreed,  
Assistance from the Vánar breed?  
Am I so feeble in thine eyes,  
Though feared by dwellers of the skies,--  
Whose might in many a battle shown  
The glorious race of giants own?  
Shall I for fear of him restore  
The lady whom I hither bore,  
Exceeding fair like Beauty's Queen  <span
id="fr_954"></span>[1](#fn_954.md)  
Without her well-loved lotus seen?  
Around the chief let Lakshman stand,  
Sugríva, and each Vánar band,  
Soon, Malyaván, thine eyes will see  
This boasted Ráma slain by me.  
I in the brunt of war defy  
The mightiest warriors of the sky;  
And if I stoop to combat men,  
Shall I be weak and tremble then?  
This mangled trunk the foe may rend,  
But Rávan ne'er can yield or bend,  
And be it vice or virtue, I  
This nature never will belie.  
What marvel if he bridged the sea?  
Why should this deed disquiet thee?  
This, only this, I surely know,  
Back with his life he shall not go.'  

Thus in loud tones the king exclaimed,  
And mute stood Malyaván ashamed,  
His reverend head he humbly bent,  
And slowly to his mansion went.  
But Rávan stayed, and deep in care  
Held counsel with his nobles there,  
All entrance to secure and close,  
And guard the city from their foes.  
He bade the chief Prahasta wait  
Commander at the eastern gate.  
To fierce Mahodar, strong and brave,  
To keep the southern gate, he gave,  
Where Mahápárs'va's might should aid  
The chieftain with his hosts arrayed.  
To guard the west--no chief more fit--  
He placed the warrior Indrajit,  

His son, the giant's joy and boast,  
Surrounded by a Rákshas host:  
And mighty Sáran hastened forth  
With Suka to protect the north.  <span
id="fr_955"></span>[1b](ry436.htm#fn_955.md)  
'I will myself,' the monarch cried,  
'Be present on the northern side.'  
These orders for the walls' defence  
The tyrant gave, then parted thence,  
And, by the hope of victory fired,  
To chambers far within, retired.
