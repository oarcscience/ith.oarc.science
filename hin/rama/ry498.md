### CANTO CXXVII.: RÁMA'S MESSAGE.

But Ráma, when he first looked down  
And saw afar Ayodhyá's town,  
Had called Hanumán to his side,  
The chief on whom his heart relied,  
And said: 'Brave Vánar, good at need,  
Haste onward, to Ayodhyá speed,  
And learn, I pray, if all be well  
With those who in the palace dwell.  
But an thou speedest on thy way  
Awhile at S'ringavera stay.  
Tell Guha the Nishádas' lord,  
That victor, with my queen restored,  
In health and strength with many a friend  
Homeward again my steps I bend  
Thence by the road that he will show  
On to Avodhyá swiftly go.  
There with my love my brother greet,  
And all our wondrous tale repeat.  
Say that victorious in the strife  
I come with Lakshman and my wife,  
Then mark with keenest eye each trace  
Of joy or grief on Bharat's face.  
Be all his gestures closely viewed,  

<span id="page_504">p. 504</span>  

Each change of look and attitude.  
Where breathes the man who will not cling  
To all that glorifies a king?  
Where beats the heart that can resign  
An ancient kingdom, nor repine  
To lose a land renowned for breeds  
Of elephants and warrior steeds?  
If, won by custom day by day,  
My brother Bharat thirsts for sway,  
Still let him rule the nations, still  
The throne of old Ikshváku fill.  
Go, mark him well: his feelings learn,  
And, ere we yet be near return.'  
   He ceased: and, garbed in human form,  
Forth sped Hanumán swift as storm.  
Sublime in air he rose, and through  
The region of his father flew.  
He saw far far beneath his feet  
Where Gangá's flood and Jumna meet.  
Descending from the upper air  
He entered S'ringavera, where  
King Guha's heart was well content  
To hear the message Ráma sent.  
Then, with his mighty strengtn renewed,  
The Vánar chief big way pursued,  
Válúkiní was far behind,  
And Gomatí with forests lined,  
And golden fields and pastures gay  
With flocks and herds beneath him lay.  
Then Nandigráma charmed his eye  
Where flowers were bright with every dye,  
And trees of lovely foliage made  
With meeting boughs delightful shade,  
Where women watched in trim array  
Their little sons' and grandsons' play.  
His eager eye on Bharat fell  
Who sat before his lonely cell.  
In hermit weed, with tangled hair,  
Pale, weak, and worn with ceaseless care.  
His royal pomp and state resigned  
For Ráma still he watched and pined,  
Still to his dreary vows adhered,  
And royal Ráma's shoes revered.  
Yet still the terror of his arm  
Preserved the land from fear and harm.  
   The Wind-God's son, in form a man,  
Raised reverent hands and thus began:  
'Fond greeting, Prince, I bring to thee,  
And Ráma's self has sent it: he  
For whom thy spirit sorrows yet  
As for a hapless anchoret  
In Dandak wood, in dire distress,  
With matted hair and hermit dress.  
This sorrow from thy bosom fling,  
And hear the tale of joy I bring.  
This day thy brother shalt thou meet  
Exulting in his foe's defeat,  
Freed from his toil and lengthened vow,  
The light of victory on his brow,  
With Sítá, Lakshman and his friends  
Homeward at last his steps he bends.'  
   Then joy, too mighty for control,  
Rushed in full flood o'er Bharat's soul;  
His reeling sense and strength gave way,  
And fainting on the earth he lay,  
At length upspringing from the ground,  
His arms about Hanumán wound,  
With tender tears of rapture sprung,  
He dewed the neck to which he clung:  
'Art thou a God or man,' he cried,  
'Whom love and pity hither guide?  
For this a hundred thousand kine,  
A hundred villages be thine.  
A score of maids of spotless lives  
To thee I give to be thy wives,  
Of golden hue and bright of face,  
Each lovely for her tender grace.'  
   He ceased a while by joy subdued,  
And then his eager speech renewed;
