<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXII.: BHARAT'S INQUIRY.</H3>
<P>
He entered in, he looked around,<BR>
Nor in the house his father found;<BR>
Then to his mother's dwelling, bent<BR>
To see her face, he quickly went.<BR>
She saw her son, so long away,<BR>
Returning after many a day,<BR>
And from her golden seat in joy<BR>
Sprung forward to her darling boy.<BR>
Within the bower, no longer bright,<BR>
Came Bharat lover of the right,<BR>
And bending with observance sweet<BR>
Clasped his dear mother's lovely feet.<BR>
Long kisses on his brow she pressed,<BR>
And held her hero to her breast,<BR>
Then fondly drew him to her knees,<BR>
And questioned him in words like these:<BR>
'How many nights have fled, since thou<BR>
Leftest thy grandsire's home, till now?<BR>
By flying steeds so swiftly borne,<BR>
Art thou not weak and travel-worn?<BR>
How fares the king my father, tell:<BR>
Is Yudh&aacute;jit thine uncle well?<BR>
And now, my son, at length declare<BR>
The pleasure of the visit there.'<BR>

<P>
Thus to the offspring of the king<BR>
She spake with tender questioning,<BR>
And to his mother made reply<BR>
Young Bharat of the lotus eye:<BR>
'The seventh night has come and fled<BR>
Since from my grandsire's home I sped:<BR>
My mother's sire is well, and he,<BR>
Yudh&aacute;jit, from all trouble free.<BR>
The gold and every precious thing<BR>
Presented by the conqueror king,<BR>
The slower guards behind convey:<BR>
I left them weary on the way.<BR>
Urged by the men my father sent,<BR>
My hasty course I hither bent:<BR>
Now, I implore, an answer deign,<BR>
And all I wish to know, explain.<BR>

<P>
Unoccupied I now behold<BR>
This couch of thine adorned with gold,<BR>
And each of King Ikshv&aacute;ku's race<BR>
Appears with dark and gloomy face.<BR>
The king is aye, my mother dear,<BR>
Most constant in his visits here.<BR>
To meet my sire I sought this spot:<BR>
How is it that I find him not?<BR>
I long to clasp my father's feet:<BR>
Say where he lingers, I entreat.<BR>
Perchance the monarch may be seen<BR>
Where dwells Kaus'aly&aacute;, eldest queen.'<BR>

<P>
His father's fate, from him concealed.<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; to her son revealed:<BR>
Told as glad news the story sad,<BR>
For lust of sway had made her mad:<BR>
'Thy father, O my darling, know,<BR>
Has gone the way all life must go:<BR>
Devout and famed, of lofty thought,<BR>
In whom the good their refuge sought.'<BR>

<P>
When Bharat pious, pure, and true,<BR>
Heard the sad words which pierced him through,<BR>
Grieved for the sire he loved so well<BR>
Prostrate upon the ground he fell:<BR>
Down fell the strong-armed hero, high<BR>
Tossing his arms, and a sad cry,<BR>
'Ah, woe is me, unhappy, slain!'<BR>
Burst from his lips again, again,<BR>
Afflicted for his father's fate<BR>
By grief's intolerable weight,<BR>
With every sense amazed and cowed<BR>
The splendid hero wailed aloud:<BR>
'Ah me, my royal father's bed<BR>
Of old a gentle radiance shed,<BR>
Like the pure sky when clouds are past,<BR>
And the moon's light is o'er it cast:<BR>
Ah, of its wisest lord bereft,<BR>
It shows to-day faint radiance left,<BR>
As when the moon has left the sky.<BR>
Or mighty Ocean's depths are dry.'<BR>

<P>
With choking sobs, with many a tear.<BR>
Pierced to the heart with grief sincere,<BR>
The best of conquerors poured his sighs,<BR>
And with his robe veiled face and eyes.<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; saw him fallen there,<BR>
Godlike, afflicted, in despair,<BR>
Used every art to move him thence,<BR>
And tried him thus with eloquence:<BR>
'Arise, arise, my dearest; why<BR>
Wilt thou, famed Prince, so lowly lie?<BR>
Not by such grief as this are moved<BR>
Good men like thee, by all approved.<BR>
The earth thy father nobly swayed,<BR>
And rites to Heaven he duly paid.<BR>
At length his race of life was run:<BR>
Thou shouldst not mourn for him, my son.'<BR>

<P>
Long on the ground he wept, and rolled<BR>
From side to side, still unconsoled,<BR>
And then, with bitter grief oppressed,<BR>
His mother with those words addressed:<BR>

<P>

<P>
'This joyful hope my bosom fed<BR>
When from my grandsire's halls I sped--<BR>
'The king will throne his eldest son,<BR>
And sacrifice, as should be done.'<BR>
But all is changed, my hope was vain,<BR>
And this sad heart is rent in twain,<BR>
For my dear father's face I miss,<BR>
Who ever sought his loved ones' bliss.<BR>
But in my absence, mother, say,<BR>
What sickness took my sire away?<BR>
Ah, happy R&aacute;ma, happy they<BR>
Allowed his funeral rites to pay!<BR>
The glorious monarch has not learned<BR>
That I his darling have returned,<BR>
Or quickly had he hither sped,<BR>
And pressed his kisses on my head.<BR>
Where is that hand whose gentle touch,<BR>
Most soft and kind I loved so much,<BR>
The hand that loved to brush away<BR>
The dust that on his darling lay?<BR>
Quick, bear the news to R&aacute;ma's ear;<BR>
Tell the great chief that I am here:<BR>
Brother, and sire, and friend, and all<BR>
Is he, and I his trusty thrall,<BR>
For noble hearts, to virtue true,<BR>
Their sires in elder brothers view.<BR>
To clasp his feet I fain would bow:<BR>
He is my hope and refuge now.<BR>
What said my glorious sire, who knew<BR>
Virtue and vice, so brave and true?<BR>
Firm in his vows, dear lady, say,<BR>
What said he ere he passed away?<BR>
What was his rede to me? I crave<BR>
To hear the last advice he gave.'<BR>

<P>
Thus closely questioned by the youth,<BR>
Kaikeyi spoke the mournful truth:<BR>
'The high-souled monarch wept and sighed,<BR>
For R&aacute;ma, S&iacute;t&aacute;, Lakshman, cried,<BR>
Then, best of all who go to bliss,<BR>
Passed to the world which follows this.<BR>
'Ah, blessed are the people who<BR>
Shall R&aacute;ma and his S&iacute;t&aacute; view,   <BR>
And Lakshman of the mighty arm,<BR>
Returning free from scathe and harm.'<BR>
Such were the words, the last of all,<BR>
Thy father, ere he died, let fall,<BR>
By Fate and Death's dread coils enwound,<BR>
As some great elephant is bound.'<BR>

<P>
He heard, yet deeper in despair,<BR>
Her lips this double woe declare,<BR>
And with sad brow that showed his pain<BR>
Questioned his mother thus again:<BR>
'But where is he, of virtue tried,<BR>
Who fills Kaus'aly&aacute;'s heart with pride,<BR>
Where is the noble R&aacute;ma? where<BR>
Is Lakshman brave, and S&iacute;t&aacute; fair?'<BR>

<P>
Thus pressed, the queen began to tell<BR>
The story as each thing befell,<BR>
And gave her son in words like these,<BR>
The mournful news she meant to please:<BR>
'The prince is gone in hermit dress<BR>
To Dandak's mighty wilderness,<BR>
And Lakshman brave and S&iacute;t&aacute; share<BR>
The wanderings of the exile there.'<BR>

<P>
Then Bharat's soul with fear was stirred<BR>
Lest R&aacute;ma from the right had erred,<BR>
And jealous for ancestral fame,<BR>
He put this question to the dame:<BR>
'Has R&aacute;ma grasped with lawless hold<BR>
A Br&aacute;hman's house, or land, or gold?<BR>
Has R&aacute;ma harmed with ill intent<BR>
Some poor or wealthy innocent?<BR>
Was R&aacute;ma, faithless to his vows,<BR>
Enamoured of anothers spouse?<BR>
Why was he sent to Dandak's wild,<BR>
Like one who kills an unborn child?'<BR>

<P>
He questioned thus: and she began<BR>
To tell her deeds and crafty plan.<BR>
Deceitful-hearted, fond, and blind<BR>
As is the way of womankind:<BR>
'No Br&aacute;hman's wealth has R&aacute;ma seized,<BR>
No dame his wandering fancy pleased;<BR>
His very eyes he ne'er allows<BR>
To gaze upon a neighbour's spouse,<BR>
But when I heard the monarch planned<BR>
To give the realm to R&aacute;ma's hand,<BR>
I prayed that R&aacute;ma hence might flee,<BR>
And claimed the throne, my son, for thee.<BR>
The king maintained the name he bare,<BR>
And did according to my prayer.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, with his brother, sent,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute;, forth to banishment.<BR>
When his dear son was seen no more,<BR>
The lord of earth was troubled sore:<BR>
Too feeble with his grief to strive,<BR>
He joined the elemental Five.<BR>
Up then, most dutiful! maintain<BR>
The royal state, arise, and reign.<BR>
For thee, my darling son, for thee<BR>
All this was planned and wrought by me.<BR>
Come, cast thy grief and pain aside,<BR>
With manly courage fortified.<BR>
This town and realm are all thine own,<BR>
And fear and grief are here unknown.<BR>
Come, with Vas'ishtha's guiding aid,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And priests in ritual skilled<BR>
Let the king's funeral dues be paid,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And every claim fulfilled.<BR>
Perform his obsequies with all<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That suits his rank and worth,<BR>
Then give the mandate to install<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thyself as lord of earth.'<BR>
