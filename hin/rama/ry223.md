### CANTO XXV.: THE BATTLE.

When Khara with the hosts he led  
Drew near to Ráma's leafy shed,  
He saw that queller of the foe  
Stand ready with his ordered bow.  
He saw, and burning at the view  
His clanging bow he raised and drew,  
And bade his driver urge apace  
His car to meet him face to face.  
Obedient to his master's hest  
His eager steeds the driver pressed  
On to the spot where, none to aid,  
The strong-armed chief his weapon swayed.  
Soon as the children of the night  
Saw Khara rushing to the fight,  

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>  

His lords with loud unearthly cry  
Followed their chief and gathered nigh.  
As in his car the leader rode  
With all his lords around, he showed  
Like the red planet fiery Mars  
Surrounded by the lesser stars.  
Then with a horrid yell that rent  
The air, the giant chieftain sent  
A thousand darts in rapid shower  
On Ráma matchless in his power.  
The rovers of the night, impelled  
By fiery rage which naught withheld,  
Upon the unconquered prince, who strained  
His fearful bow, their arrows rained.  
With sword and club, with mace and pike,  
With spear and axe to pierce and strike,  
Those furious fiends on every side  
The unconquerable hero plied.  
The giant legions huge and strong,  
Like clouds the tempest drives along,  
Rushed upon Ráma with the speed  
Of whirling car, and mounted steed,  
And hill-like elephant, to slay  
The matchless prince in battle fray.  
Then upon Ráma thick and fast  
The rain of mortal steel they cast,  
As labouring clouds their torrents shed  
Upon the mountain-monarch's <span id="fr_468"></span>[1](#fn_468.md)
head.  
As near and nearer round him drew  
The warriors of the giant crew,  
He showed like S'iva girt by all  
His spirits when night's shadows fall.  
As the great deep receives each rill  
And river rushing from the hill,  
He bore that flood of darts, and broke  
With well-aimed shaft each murderous stroke.  
By stress of arrowy storm assailed,  
And wounded sore, he never failed,  
Like some high mountain which defies  
The red bolts flashing from the skies.  
With ruddy streams each limb was dyed  
From gaping wounds in breast and side,  
Showing the hero like the sun  
'Mid crimson clouds ere day is done.  
Then, at that sight of terror, faint  
Grew God, Gandharva, sage, and saint,  
Trembling to see the prince oppose  
His single might to myriad foes.  
But waxing wroth, with force unspent,  
He strained his bow to utmost bent,  
And forth his arrows keen and true  
In hundreds, yea in thousands flew,--  
Shafts none could ward, and none endure:  
Death's fatal noose was scarce so sure.  
As 'twere in playful ease he shot  
His gilded shafts, and rested not.  
With swiftest flight and truest aim  
Upon the giant hosts they came.  

Each smote, each stayed a foeman's breath  
As fatal as the coil of Death,  
Each arrow through a giant tore  
A passage, and besmeared with gore,  
Pursued its onward way and through  
The air with flamy brilliance flew.  
Unnumbered were the arrows sent  
From the great bow which Ráma bent,  
And every shaft with iron head  
The lifeblood of a giant shed.  
Their pennoned bows were cleft, nor mail  
Nor shield of hide could aught avail.  
For Ráma's myriad arrows tore  
Through arms, and bracelets which they wore,  
And severed mighty warriors' thighs  
Like trunks of elephants in size,  
And cut resistless passage sheer  
Through gold-decked horse and charioteer,  
Slew elephant and rider, slew  
The horseman and the charger too,  
And infantry unnumbered sent  
To dwell 'neath Yama's government.  
Then rose on high a fearful yell  
Of rovers of the night, who fell  
Beneath that iron torrent, sore  
Wounded by shafts that rent and tore.  
So mangled by the ceaseless storm  
Of shafts of every kind and form,  
Such joy they found, as forests feel  
When scorched by flame, from Ráma's steel.  
The mightiest still the fight maintained,  
And furious upon Ráma rained  
Dart, arrow, spear, with wild attacks  
Of mace, and club, and battle-axe.  
But the great chief, unconquered yet,  
Their weapons with his arrows met,  
Which severed many a giant's head,  
And all the plain with corpses spread.  
With sundered bow and shattered shield  
Headless they sank upon the field,  
As the tall trees, that felt the blast  
Of Garud's wing, to earth were cast.  
The giants left unslaughtered there  
Where filled with terror and despair,  
And to their leader Khara fled  
Faint, wounded, and discomfited.  
These fiery Dúshan strove to cheer,  
And poised his bow to calm their fear;  
Then fierce as He who rules the dead,  
When wroth, on angered Ráma sped.  
By Dúshan cheered, the demons cast  
Their dread aside and rallied fast  
With Sáls, rocks, palm-trees in their hands  
With nooses, maces, pikes, and brands,  
Again upon the godlike man  
The mighty fiends infuriate ran,  
These casting rocks like hail, and these  
A whelming shower of leafy trees.  
Wild, wondrous fight, the eye to scare,  
And raise on end each shuddering hair,  

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>  

As with the fiends who loved to rove  
By night heroic Ráma strove!  
The giants in their fury plied  
Ráma with darts on every side.  
Then, by the gathering demons pressed  
From north and south and east and west,  
By showers of deadly darts assailed  
From every quarter fiercely hailed,  
Girt by the foes who swarmed around,  
He raised a mighty shout whose sound  
Struck terror. On the giant crew  
His great Gándharva <span id="fr_469"></span>[1](ry224.htm#fn_469.md) arrow
flew.  
A thousand mortal shafts were rained  
From the orbed bow the hero strained,  
Till east and west and south and north  
Were filled with arrows volleyed forth.  
They heard the fearful shout: they saw  
His mighty hand the bowstring draw,  
Yet could no wounded giant's eye  
See the swift storm of arrows fly.  
Still firm the warrior stood and cast  
His deadly missiles thick and fast.  
Dark grew the air with arrowy hail  
Which hid the sun as with a veil.  
Fiends wounded, falling, fallen, slain,  
All in a moment, spread the plain,  
And thousands scarce alive were left  
Mangled, and gashed, and torn, and cleft.  
Dire was the sight, the plain o'erspread  
With trophies of the mangled dead.  
There lay, by Ráma's missiles rent,  
Full many a priceless ornament,  
With severed limb and broken gem,  
Hauberk and helm and diadem.  
There lay the shattered car, the steed,  
The elephant of noblest breed,  
The splintered spear, the shivered mace,  
Chouris and screens to shade the face.  
The giants saw with bitterest pain  
Their warriors weltering on the plain,  
Nor dared again his might oppose  
Who scourged the cities of his foes.
