### CANTO LXXI.: ATIKÁYA'S DEATH.

But Atikáya's wrath grew high  
To see his noblest kinsmen die.  
He, fiercest of the giant race,  
Presuming still on Brahmá's grace;  
Proud tamer of the immortals' pride,  
Whose power and might with Indra's vied,  
For blood and vengeful carnage burned,  
And on the foe his fury turned.  
High on a car that flashed and glowed  
Bright as a thousand suns he rode.  
Around his princely brows was set  
A rich bejewelled coronet.  
Gold pendants in his ears he wore;  
He strained and tried the bow he bore,  
And ever, as a shaft he aimed,  
His name and royal race proclaimed.  
Scarce might the Vánars brook to hear  
His clanging bow and voice of fear:  
To Raghu's elder son they fled,  
Their sure defence in woe and dread.  
Then Ráma bent his eyes afar  
And saw the giant in his car  
Fast following the flying crowd  
And roaring like a rainy cloud.  
He, with the lust of battle fired,  
Turned to Vibhíshan and inquired:  
'Say, who is this, of mountain size,  
This archer with the lion eyes?  
His car, which strikes our host with awe,  
A thousand eager coursers draw.  
Surrounded by the flashing spears  
Which line his car, the chief appears  
Like some huge cloud when lightnings play  
About it on a stormy day;  
And the great bow he joys to hold  
Whose bended back is bright with gold,  
As Indra's bow makes glad the skies,  
That best of chariots glorifies.  
O see the sunlike splendour flung  
From the great flag above him hung,  
Where, blazened with refulgent lines,  
Ráhu  <span id="fr_1005"></span>[1](#fn_1005.md) the dreadful Dragon
shines.  
Full thirty qivers near his side,  
His car with shafts is well supplied:  

<span id="page_483">p. 483</span>  

And flashing like the light of stars  
Gleam his two mighty scimitars.  
Say, best of giants, who is he  
Before whose face the Vánars flee?'  
   Thus Ráma spake. Vibhíshan eyed  
The giants chief, and thus replied:  
'This Ráma, this is Rávan's son:  
High fame his youthful might has won.  
He, best of warriors, bows his ear  
The wisdom of the wise to hear.  
Supreme is he mid those who know  
The mastery of sword and bow.  
Unrivalled in the bold attack  
On elephant's or courser's back,  
He knows, beside, each subtler art,  
To win the foe, to bribe, or part.  
On him the giant hosts rely,  
And fear no ill when he is nigh.  
This peerless chieftain bears the name  
Of Atikáva huge of frame,  
Whom Dhanyamáliní of yore  
To Rávan lord of Lanká bore.'  
   Roused by his bow-string's awful clang,  
To meet their foes the Vánars sprang.  
Armed with tall trees from Lanká's wood,  
And rocks and mountain peaks, they stood.  
The giant's arrows, gold-bedecked,  
The storm of hurtling missiles checked;  
And ever on his foemen poured  
Fierce tempest from his clanging cord;  
Nor could the Vánar chiefs sustain  
His shafts' intolerable rain.  
They fled: the victor gained the place  
Where stood the lord of Raghu's race,  
And cried with voice of thunder: 'Lo,  
Borne on my car, with shaft and bow,  
I, champion of the giants, scorn  
To fight with weaklings humbly born.  
Come forth your bravest, if he dare,  
And right with one who will not spare.'  
   Forth sprang Sumitrá's noble child,  <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[1](#fn_1006.md)  
And strained his ready bow, and smiled;  
And giants trembled as the clang  
Through heaven and earth reechoing rang.  
The giant to his string applied  
A pointed shaft, and proudly cried;  
'Turn, turn, Sumitrá's son and fly,  
For terrible as Death am I  
Fly, nor that youthful form oppose,  
Untrained in war, to warriors' blows.  
What! wilt thou waste thy childish breath  
And wake the dormant fire of death?  
Cast down, rash boy, that useless bow:  
Preserve thy life, uninjured go.'  
   He ceased: and stirred by wrath & pride  
Sumitrá's noble son replied:  
'By warlike deed, not words alone,  
The valour of the brave is shown.  
Cease with vain boasts my scorn to move,  

And with thine arm thy prowess prove.  
Borne on thy car, with sword and bow,  
With all thine arms, thy valour show.  
Fight, and my deadly shafts this day  
Low in the dust thy head shall lay,  
And, rushing fast in ceaseless flood,  
Shall rend thy flesh and drink thy blood.'  
   His giant foe no answer made,  
But on his string an arrow laid.  
He raised his arm, the cord he drew,  
At Lakshman's breast the arrow flew.  
Sumitrá's son, his foemen's dread,  
Shot a fleet shaft with crescent head,  
Which cleft that arrow pointed well,  
And harmless to the earth it fell.  
A shower of shafts from Lakshman's bow  
Fell fast and furious on the foe  
Who quailed not as the missiles smote  
With idle force his iron coat.  
Then came the friendly Wind-God near,  
And whispered thus in Lakshman's ear:  
'Such shafts as these in vain assail  
Thy foe's impenetrable mail.  
A more tremendous missile try,  
Or never may the giant die.  
Employ the mighty spell, and aim  
The weapon known by Brahma's name.'  
He ceased - Sumitrá's son obeyed:  
On his great bow the shaft was laid,  
And with a roar like thunder, true  
As Indra's flashing bolt, it flew.  
The giant poured his shafts like rain  
To check its course, but all in vain.  
With spear and mace and sword he tried  
To turn the fiery dart aside.  
Winged with a force which naught could check.  
It smote the monster in the neck,  
And, sundered from his shoulders, rolled  
To earth his head and helm of gold.
