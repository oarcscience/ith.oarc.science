<P>
Then Angad spake: 'We V&aacute;nars<BR>
Have searched each valley, cave, and dell,<BR>
And hill, and brook, and dark recess,<BR>
And tangled wood, and wilderness.<BR>
But all in vain: no eye has seen<BR>
The robber or the Maithil queen.<BR>
A dreary time has passed away,<BR>
And stern is he we all obey.<BR>
Come, cast your grief and sloth aside:<BR>
Again be every effort tried;<BR>
So haply may our toil attain<BR>
The sweet success that follows pain.<BR>
Laborious effort, toil, and skill,<BR>
The firm resolve, the constant will<BR>
Secure at last the ends we seek:<BR>
Hence, O my friends, I boldly speak.<BR>
Once more then, noble hearts, once more<BR>
Let us to-day this wood explore,<BR>
And, languor and despair subdued,<BR>
Purchase success with toil renewed.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Sugr&iacute;va king austere,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma's wrath we needs must fear.<BR>
Come, V&aacute;narsye think it wise,<BR>
And do the thing that I advise'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then Gandham&aacute;dan replied<BR>
With lips that toil and thirst had dried;<BR>
'Obey his words, for wise and true<BR>
Is all that he has counselled you.<BR>
Come, let your hosts their toil renew<BR>
And search each grove and desert through,<BR>
Each towering hill and forest glade.<BR>
By lake and brook and white cascade,<BR>
Till every spot, as our great lord<BR>
Commanded, be again explored.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Uprose the V&aacute;narsand all,<BR>
Obedient to the chieftain's call,<BR>
And over the southern region sped<BR>
Where Vindhya's tangled forests spread.<BR>
They clomb that hill that towers on high<BR>
Like a huge cloud in autumn's sky,<BR>
Where many a cavern yawns, and streaks<BR>
Of radiant silver deck the peaks.<BR>
In eager search they wandered through<BR>
The forests where the Lodh trees grew,<BR>
Where the dark leaves were thick and green,<BR>
But found not R&aacute;ma's darling queen.<BR>
Then faint with toil, their hearts depressed,<BR>
Descending from the mountain's crest,<BR>
Their weary limbs a while to ease<BR>
They lay beneath the spreading trees.<BR>
