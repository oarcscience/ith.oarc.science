<P>
Thus counselled by their friendly guide<BR>
On through the wood the princes hied<BR>
Pursuing still the eastern road<BR>
To Pampa which Kabandha showed,<BR>
Where trees that on the mountains grew<BR>
With fruit like honey charmed the view<BR>
They rested weary for the night<BR>
Upon a mountain's wooded height,<BR>
Then onward with the dawn they hied<BR>
And stood, on Pampa's western side.<BR>
Where S'avan's fair home they viewed<BR>
Deep in that shady solitude.<BR>
The princes reached the holy ground<BR>
Where noble trees stood thick around,<BR>
And joying in the lovely view<BR>
Near to the aged votress drew.<BR>
To meet the sons of Raghu came,<BR>
With hands upraised, the pious dame,<BR>
And bending low with reverence meet<BR>
Welcomed them both and pressed theif feet,<BR>
Then water, as beseems, she gave,<BR>
Their lips to cool, their feet to lave.<BR>
To that pure saint who never broke<BR>
One law of duty R&aacute;ma--spoke:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'I trust no cares invade thy peace,<BR>
While holy works and zeal increase;<BR>
That thou content with scanty food<BR>
All touch of ire hast long subdued;<BR>
That all thy vows are well maintained;<BR>

While peace of mind is surely gained:<BR>
That reverence of the saints who taught<BR>
The faithful heart due fruit has brought.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The aged votaress pure of taint,<BR>
Revered by every perfect saint,<BR>
Rose to her feet by R&aacute;ma's side<BR>
And thus in gentle tones replied:<BR>
'My penance' meed this day I see<BR>
Complete, my lord, in meeting thee.<BR>
This day the fruit of birth I gain,<BR>
Nor have I served the saints in vain,<BR>
I reap rich fruits of toil and vow,<BR>
And heaven itself awaits me now,<BR>
When I, O chief of men, have done<BR>
Honour to thee the godlike one.<BR>
I feel, great lord, thy gentle eye<BR>
My earthly spirit purify,<BR>
And I, brave tamer of thy foes,<BR>
Shall through thy grace in bliss repose.<BR>
Thy feet by Chitrak&aacute;ta strayed<BR>
When those great saints whom I obeyed,<BR>
In dazzling chariots bright of hue,<BR>
Hence to their heavenly mansions flew.<BR>
As the high saints were borne away<BR>
I heard their holy  voices say:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'In this pure grove, O devotee,<BR>
Prince R&aacute;ma soon will visit thee.<BR>
When he and Lakshman seek this shade,<BR>
Be to thy guests all honour paid.<BR>
Him shalt thou see, and pass away<BR>
To those blest worlds which ne'er decay.'<BR>
To me, O mighty chief, the best<BR>
Of lofty saints these words addressed.<BR>
Laid up within my dwelling lie<BR>
Fruits of each sort which woods supply,--<BR>
Food culled for thee in endless store<BR>
From every tree on Pamp&aacute;'s shore.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus to her virtuous guest she sued<BR>
And he, with heavenly lore endued,<BR>
Words such as these in turn addressed<BR>
To her with equal knowledge blest:<BR>
'Danu himself the power has told<BR>
Of thy great masters lofty-souled.<BR>
Now if thou will, mine eyes would fain<BR>
Assurance of their glories gain.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  She heard the prince his wish declare:<BR>
Then rose she, and the royal pair<BR>
Of brothers through the wood she led<BR>
That round her holy dwelling spread.<BR>
'Behold Matanga's wood' she cried,<BR>
'A grove made famous far and wide,<BR>
Dark as thick clouds and tilled with herds<BR>
Of wandering deer, and joyous birds.<BR>
In this pure spot each reverend sire<BR>
With offerings fed the holy fire.<BR>
See here the western altar stands<BR>
Where daily with their trembling hands<BR>
The aged saints, so long obeyed<BR>
By me, their gifts of blossoms laid.<BR>
The holy power, O Raghu's son,<BR>
By their ascetic virtue won,<BR>
Still keeps their well-loved altar bright.<BR>
Filling the air with beams of light.<BR>
And those seven neighbouring lakes behold<BR>
Which, when the saints infirm and old,<BR>
Worn out by fasts, no longer sought,<BR>
Moved hither drawn by power of thought.<BR>
Look, R&aacute;ma, where the devotees<BR>
Hung their bark mantles on the trees.<BR>
Fresh from the bath: those garments wet<BR>
Through many a day are dripping yet.<BR>
See, through those aged hermits' power<BR>
The tender spray, this bright-hued flower<BR>
With which the saints their worship paid,<BR>
Fresh to this hour nor change nor fade.<BR>
Here thou hast seen each lawn and dell,<BR>
And heard the tale I had to tell:<BR>
Permit thy servant, lord, I pray,<BR>
To cast this mortal shell away,<BR>
For I would dwell, this life resigned,<BR>
With those great saints of lofty mind,<BR>
Whom I within this holy shade<BR>
With reverential care obeyed.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When R&aacute;ma and his brother heard<BR>
The pious prayer the dame preferred,<BR>
Filled full of transport and amazed<BR>
They marvelled as her words they praised.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma to the votaress said<BR>
Whose holy vows were perfected<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Go, lady, where thou fain wouldst be,<BR>
O thou who well hast honoured me.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Her locks in hermit fashion tied,<BR>
Clad in hark coat and black deer-hide,<BR>
When R&aacute;ma gave consent, the dame<BR>
Resigned her body to the flame.<BR>
Then like the fire that burns and glows.<BR>
To heaven the sainted lady rose,<BR>
In all her heavenly garments dressed,<BR>
Immortal wreaths on neck and breast,<BR>
Bright with celestial gems she shone<BR>
Most beautiful to look upon,<BR>
And like the flame of lightning sent<BR>
A glory through the firmament.<BR>
That holy sphere the dame attained,<BR>
By depth of contemplation gained,<BR>
Where roam high saints with spirits pure<BR>
In bliss that shall for aye endure.<BR>
