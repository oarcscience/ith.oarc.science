### CANTO XCIII.: CHITRAKÚTA IN SIGHT.

As through the woods its way pursued  
That mignty bannered multitude,  
Wild elephants in terror fled  
With all the startled herds they led,  
And bears and deer were seen on hill,  
In forest glade, by every rill.  
Wide as the sea from coast to coast,  
The high-souled Bharat's mighty host  
Covered the earth as cloudy trains  
Obscure the sky when fall the rains.  
The stately elephants he led,  
And countless steeds the land o'erspread,  
So closely crowded that between  
Their serried ranks no ground was seen.  
Then when the host had travelled far,  
And steeds were worn who drew the car,  
The glorious Bharat thus addressed  
Vas'ishtha, of his lords the best:  
'The spot, methinks, we now behold  
Of which the holy hermit told,  
For, as his words described, I trace  
Each several feature of the place:  
Before us Chitrakúta shows,  
Mandákiní beside us flows:  
Afar umbrageous woods arise  
Like darksome clouds that veil the skies.  
Now tread these mountain-beasts of mine  
On Chitrakúta's fair incline.  
The trees their rain of blossoms shed  
On table-lands beneath them spread,  
As from black clouds the floods descend  
When the hot days of summer end.  
S'atrughna, look, the mountain see  
Where heavenly minstrels wander free,  

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>  

And horses browse beneath the steep.  
Countless as monsters in the deep.  
Scared by my host the mountain deer  
Starting with tempest speed appear  
Like the long lines of cloud that fly  
In autumn through the windy sky.  
See, every warrior shows his head  
With fragrant blooms engarlanded;  
All look like southern soldiers who  
Lift up their shields of azure hue.  
This lonely wood beneath the hill.  
That was so dark and drear and still,  
Covered with men in endless streams  
Now like Ayodhyá's city seems.  
The dust which countless hoofs excite  
Obscures the sky and veils the light;  
But see, swift winds those clouds dispel  
As if they strove to please me well.  
See, guided in their swift career  
By many a skilful charioteer,  
Those cars by fleetest coursers drawn  
Race onward over glade and lawn.  
Look, startled as the host comes near  
The lovely peacocks fly in fear,  
Gorgeous as if the fairest blooms  
Of earth had glorified their plumes.  
Look where the sheltering covert shows  
The trooping deer, both bucks and does,  
That occupy in countless herds  
This mountain populous with birds.  
Most lovely to my mind appears  
This place which every charm endears:  
Fair as the road where tread the Blest;  
Here holy hermits take their rest,  
Then let the army onward press  
And duly search each green recess  
For the two lion-lords, till we  
Ráma once more and Lakshman see.'  

Thus Bharat spoke: and hero bands  
Of men with weapons in their hands  
Entered the tangled forest: then  
A spire of smoke appeared in ken.  
Soon as they saw the rising smoke  
To Bharat they returned and spoke:  
'No fire where men are not: 'tis clear  
That Raghu's sons are dwelling here.  
Or if not here those heros dwell  
Whose mighty arms their foeman quell,  
Still other hermits here must be  
Like Ráma, true and good as he.'  

His ears attentive Bharat lent  
To their resistless argument,  
Then to his troops the chief who broke  
His foe's embattled armies spoke:  
'Here let the troops in silence stay;  
One step beyond they must not stray.  
Come Dhrishti and Sumantra, you  
With me alone the path pursue.'  
Their leader's speech the warriors heard,  
And from his place no soldier stirred,  
And Bharat beat his eager eyes  
Where curling smoke was seen to rise.  

The host his order well obeyed,  
And halting there in silence stayed  
Watching where from the thicket's shade  
   They saw the smoke appear.  
And joy through all the army ran,  
'Soon shall we meet,' thought every man,  
   'The prince we hold so dear.'
