<P>
Then R&aacute;ma bathed in order due,<BR>
His mind from worldly thoughts withdrew,<BR>
And with big large-eyed wife besought<BR>
N&aacute;r&aacute;yan, as a votary ought.<BR>
Upon his head the brimming cup<BR>
Of holy oil he lifted up,<BR>
Then placed within the kindled fire<BR>
The offering to that heavenly Sire,<BR>
And as he sipped the remnant prayed<BR>
To Him for blessing and for aid.<BR>
Then with still lips and tranquil mind<BR>
With his Videhan he reclined,<BR>
In Vishnu's chapel, on a bed<BR>
Where holy grass was duly spread,<BR>
While still the prince's every thought<BR>
Tbe God supreme, N&aacute;r&aacute;yan, sought.<BR>
One watch remained the night to close<BR>
When R&aacute;ma from his couch arose,<BR>
And bade the men and maids adorn<BR>
His palace for the solemn morn.<BR>
He heard the bards and heralds raise<BR>
Auspicious strains of joy and praise;<BR>
And breathed devout, with voice restrained,<BR>
The hymn for morning rites ordained;<BR>
Then, with his head in reverence bowed,<BR>
Praised Madhu's conquering foe aloud.<BR>
And, in pure linen robes arrayed,<BR>
The priests to raise their voices prayed.<BR>
Obedient to the summons they<BR>
Proclaimed to all the festal day.<BR>
The Br&aacute;hmans' voices, deep and sweet,<BR>
Resounded through the crowded street,<BR>
And echoed through Ayodhy&aacute; went<BR>
By many a loud-toned instrument.<BR>
Then all the people joyed to hear<BR>
That R&aacute;ma with his consort dear<BR>
Had fasted till the morning light<BR>
In preparation for the rite.<BR>
Swiftly the joyful tidings through<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute;'s crowded city flew,<BR>
And soon as dawn appeared, each man<BR>
To decorate the town began.<BR>

In all the temples bright and fair<BR>
As white clouds towering in the air,<BR>
In streets, and where the cross-ways met,<BR>
Where holy fig-trees had been set,<BR>
In open square, in sacred shade,<BR>
Where merchants' shops their wealth displayed,<BR>
On all the mansions of the great,<BR>
And householders of wealth and state,<BR>
Where'er the people loved to meet,<BR>
Where'er a tree adorned the street,<BR>
Gay banners floated to the wind,<BR>
And ribands round the staves were twined.<BR>
Then clear the singers' voices rang,<BR>
As, charming mind and ear, they sang.<BR>
Here players shone in bright attire,<BR>
There dancing women swelled the quire.<BR>
Each with his friend had much to say<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma's consecration-day:<BR>
Yea, even children, as they played<BR>
At cottage doors beneath the shade.<BR>
The royal street with flowers was strown<BR>
Which loving hands in heaps had thrown,<BR>
And here and there rich incense lent<BR>
Its fragrance to the garland's scent;<BR>
And all was fresh and fair and bright<BR>
In honour of the coming rite.<BR>
With careful foresight to illume<BR>
With borrowed blaze the midnight gloom,<BR>
The crowds erected here and there<BR>
Trees in each street gay lamps to bear.<BR>
The city thus from side to side<BR>
In festal guise was beautified.<BR>
The people of the town who longed<BR>
To view the rite together thronged,<BR>
And filling every court and square<BR>
Praised the good king in converse there:<BR>
'Our high-souled king! He throws a grace<BR>
On old Ikshv&aacute;ku's royal race.<BR>
He feels his years' increasing weight,<BR>
And makes his son associate.<BR>
Great joy to us the choice will bring<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma for our lord and king.<BR>
The good and bad to him are known,<BR>
And long will he protect his own.<BR>
No pride his prudent breast may swell,<BR>
Most just, he loves his brothers well,<BR>
And to us all that love extends,<BR>
Cherished as brothers and as friends.<BR>
Long may our lord in life remain,<BR>
Good Das'aratha, free from stain,<BR>
By whose most gracious favour we<BR>
R&aacute;ma anointed king shall see.'<BR>

<P>
Such were the words the townsmen spoke<BR>
Heard by the gathering countryfolk,<BR>
Who from the south, north, east, and west,<BR>
Stirred by the joyful tidings, pressed.<BR>
For by their eager longing led<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's consecration sped<BR>
The villagers from every side,<BR>
And filled Ayodhy&aacute;'s city wide.<BR>
This way and that way strayed the crowd,<BR>
While rose a murmur long and loud,<BR>
As when the full moon floods the skies<BR>
And Ocean's waves with thunder rise.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That town, like Indra's city fair,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    While peasants thronged her ways.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Tumultuous roared like Ocean, where<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Each flood-born monster plays.<BR>
