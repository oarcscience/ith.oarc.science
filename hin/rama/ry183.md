### CANTO CV.: RAMA'S SPEECH.

A while they sat, each lip compressed,  
Then Bharat thus his chief addressed:  
'My mother here was made content;  
To me was given the government.  
This now, my lord, I yield to thee:  
Enjoy it, from all trouble free.  
Like a great bridge the floods have rent,  
Impetuous in their wild descent,  
All other hands but thine in vain  
Would strive the burthen to maintain.  
In vain the ass with steeds would vie,  
With Tárkshya,  <span id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_381.md) birds that wing
the sky;  
So, lord of men, my power is slight  
To rival thine imperial might.  
Great joys his happy days attend  
On whom the hopes of men depend,  
But wretched is the life he leads  
Who still the aid of others needs.  
And if the seed a man has sown,  
With care and kindly nurture grown,  
Rear its huge trunk and spring in time  
Too bulky for a dwarf to climb,  
Yet, with perpetual blossom gay,  
No fruit upon its boughs display,  
Ne'er can that tree, thus nursed in vain,  
Approval of the virtuous gain.  
The simile is meant to be  
Applied, O mighty-armed, to thee,  
Because, our lord and leader, thou  
Protectest not thy people now.  
O, be the longing wish fulfilled  
Of every chief of house and guild,  
To see again their sun-bright lord  
Victorious to his realm restored!  
As thou returnest through the crowd  
Let roars of elephants be loud.  
And each fair woman lift her voice  
And in her new-found king rejoice.'  
  The people all with longing moved,  
The words that Bharat spoke approved,  
And crowding near to Ráma pressed  
The hero with the same request.  
The steadfast Ráma, when he viewed  
His glorious brother's mournful mood,  
With each ambitious thought controlled,  
Thus the lamenting prince consoled:  
'I cannot do the things I will,  
For Ráma is but mortal still.  
Fate with supreme, resistless law  
This way and that its slave will draw,  
All gathered heaps must waste away,  
All lofty lore and powers decay.  

Death is the end of life, and all,  
Now firmly joined, apart must fall.  
One fear the ripened fruit must know,  
To fall upon the earth below;  
So every man who draws his breath  
Must fear inevitable death.  
The pillared mansion, high, compact,  
Must fall by Time's strong hand attacked;  
So mortal men, the gradual prey  
Of old and ruthless death, decay.  
The night that flies no more returns:  
Yamuná for the Ocean yearns:  
Swift her impetuous waters flee,  
But roll not backward from the sea.  
The days and nights pass swiftly by  
And steal our moments as they fly.  
E'en as the sun's unpitying rays  
Drink up the floods in summer blaze.  
Then for thyself lament and leave  
For death of other men to grieve,  
For if thou go or if thou stay.  
Thy life is shorter day by day.  
Death travels with us; death attends  
Our steps until our journey ends.  
Death, when the traveller wins the goal,  
Returns with the returning soul.  
The flowing hair grown\* white and thin,  
And wrinkles mark the altered skin.  
The ills of age man's strength assail:  
Ah, what can mortal power avail?  
Men joy to see the sun arise,  
They watch him set with joyful eyes:  
But ne'er reflect, too blind to see,  
How fast their own brief moments flee.  
With lovely change for ever new  
The seasons' sweet return they view,  
Nor think with heedless hearts the while  
That lives decay as seasons smile.  
As haply on the boundless main  
Meet drifting logs and part again.  
So wives and children, friends and gold,  
Oures for a little time we hold:  
Soon by resistless laws of fate  
To meet no more we separate.  
In all this changing world not one  
The common lot of all can shun:  
Then why with useless tears deplore  
The dead whom tears can bring no more?  
As one might stand upon the way  
And to a troop of travellers say:  
'If ye allow it, sirs, I too  
Will travel on the road with you:'  
So why should mortal man lament  
When on that path his feet are bent  
Which all men living needs must tread,  
Where sire and ancestors have led?  
Life flies as torrents downward fall  
Speeding away without recall,  
So virtue should our thoughts engage,  
For bliss  <span id="fr_382"></span>[1b](#fn_382.md) is mortals'
heritage,  

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>  

By ceaseless care and earnest zeal  
For servants and for people's weal,  
By gifts, by duty nobly done,  
Our glorious sire the skies has won.  
Our lord the king, o'er earth who reigned,  
A blissful home in heaven has gained  
By wealth in ample largess spent,  
And many a rite magnificent:  
With constant joy from first to last  
A long and noble life he passed,  
Praised by the good, no tears should dim  
Our eyes, O brother dear, for him.  
His human body, worn and tried  
By length of days, he cast aside,  
And gained the godlike bliss to stray  
In Brahma's heavenly home for aye.  
"For such the wise as we are, deep  
In Veda lore, should never weep.  
Those who are firm and ever wise  
Spurn vain lament and idle sighs.  
Be self-possessed: thy grief restrain:  
Go, in that city dwell again.  
Return, O best of men, and be  
Obedient to our sire's decree,  
While I with every care fulfil  
Our holy father's righteous will,  
Observing in the lonely wood  
His charge approved by all the good,'  

   Thus Ráma of the lofty mind  
     To Bharat spoke his righteous speech,  
   By every argument designed  
     Obedience to his sire to teach,
