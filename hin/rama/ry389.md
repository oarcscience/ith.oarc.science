### CANTO LI.: HANUMÁN'S REPLY.

My king Sugriva greets thee fair,  
And bids me thus his rede declare.  
Son of the God of Wind, by name  
Hanumán, to this isle I came.  
To set the Maithil lady free  
I crossed the barrier of the sea.  
I roamed in search of her and found  
Her weeping on that lovely ground.  
Then in the lore of duty trained,  
Who hast by stern devotion gained  
This wondrous wealth and power and fame  
Shouldst fear to wrong another's dame.  

Hear thou my counsel, and be wise:  
No fiend, no dweller in the skies  
Can bear the shafts by Lakshman shot,  
Or Ráma when his wrath is hot.  
O Giant King, repent the crime  
And soothe him while there yet is time.  
Now be the Maithil queen restored  
Uninjured to her sorrowing lord.  
Soon wilt thou rue thy dire mistake:  
She is no woman but a snake,  
Whose very deadly bite will be  
The ruin of thy house and thee.  
Thy pride has led thy thoughts astray,  
That fancy not a hand may slay  
The monarch of the giants, screened  
From mortal blow of God and fiend.  
Sugríva still thy death may be:  
No Yaksha, fiend, or God is he  
And Ráma from a woman springs,  
The mortal seed of mortal kings.  
O think how Báli fell subdued;  
Think on thy slaughtered multitude.  
Respect those brave and strong allies;  
Consult thy safety, and be wise.  
I, even I, no helper need  
To overthrow, with car and steed,  
Thy city Lanká half divine:  
The power but not the will is mine.  
For Raghu's son, before his friend  
Tne Vánar monarch, strove to end  
With his own conquering arm the life  
Of him who stole his darling wife.  
Turn, and be wise, O Rávan turn;  
Or thou wilt see thy Lanká burn,  
And with thy wives, friends, kith and kin  
Be ruined for thy senseless sin.'
