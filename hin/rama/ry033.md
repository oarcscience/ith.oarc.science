### CANTO XXXI: THE PERFECT HERMITAGE.

Thus spoke the prince of boundless might,  
And thus replied the anchorite:  
'Chief of the mighty arm, of yore  
Lord Vishnu whom the Gods adore,  
For holy thought and rites austere  
Of penance made his dwelling here.  
This ancient wood was called of old  
Grave of the Dwarf, the mighty-souled,  
And when perfection he attained  
The grove the name of Perfect gained.  
Bali of yore, Virochan's son,  
Dominion over Indra won,  
And when with power his proud heart swelled,  
O'er the three worlds his empire held.  
When Bali then began a rite,  
The Gods and Indra in affright  
Sought Vishnu in this place of rest,  
And thus with prayers the God addressed:  
'Bali, Virochan's mighty son,  
His sacrifice has now begun:  
Of boundless wealth, that demon king  
Is bounteous to each living thing.  
Though suppliants flock from every side  
The suit of none is e'er denied.  
Whate'er, where'er, howe'er the call,  
He hears the suit and gives to all.  
Now with thine own illusive art  
Perform, O Lord, the helper's part:  
Assume a dwarfish form, and thus  
From fear and danger rescue us.' <span id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_166)  

Thus in their dread the Immortals sued:  
The God a dwarflike shape indued: <span
id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_167)  
Before Virochan's son he came,  
Three steps of land his only claim.  
The boon obtained, in wondrous wise  
Lord Vishnu's form increased in size;  
Through all the worlds, tremendous, vast,  
God of the Triple Step, he passed. <span
id="fr_168"></span>[3](#fn_168)  
The whole broad earth from side to side  
He measured with one mighty stride,  
Spanned with the next the firmament,  
And with the third through heaven he went.  

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>  

Thus was the king of demons hurled  
By Vishnu to the nether world,  
And thus the universe restored  
To Indra's rule, its ancient lord.  
And now because the immortal God  
This spot in dwarflike semblance trod,  
The grove has aye been loved by me  
For reverence of the devotee.  
But demons haunt it, prompt to stay  
Each holy offering I would pay.  
Be thine, O lion-lord, to kill  
These giants that delight in ill.  
This day, beloved child, our feet  
Shall rest within the calm retreat:  
And know, thou chief of Raghu's line,  
My hermitage is also thine.'  
   He spoke; and soon the anchorite,  
With joyous looks that beamed delight,  
With Ráma and his brother stood  
Within the consecrated wood.  
Soon as they saw the holy man,  
With one accord together ran  
The dwellers in the sacred shade,  
And to the saint their reverence paid,  
And offered water for his feet,  
The gift of honour and a seat;  
And next with hospitable care  
They entertained the princely pair.  
The royal tamers of their foes  
Rested awhile in sweet repose:  
Then to the chief of hermits sued  
Standing in suppliant attitude:  
'Begin, O best of saints, we pray,  
Initiatory rites to-day.  
This Perfect Grove shall be anew  
Made perfect, and thy words be true.'  
   Then, thus addressed, the holy man,  
The very glorious sage, began  
The high preliminary rite.  
Restraining sense and appetite.  
Calmly the youths that night reposed,  
And rose when morn her light disclosed,  
Their morning worship paid, and took  
Of lustral water from the brook.  
Thus purified they breathed the prayer,  
Then greeted Vis'vamítra where  
As celebrant he sate beside  
The flame with sacred oil supplied.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_166"></span>[43:1](ry033.htm#fr_166) I omit, after this
line, eight *s'lokas* which, as Schlegel allows, are quite out of place.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[43:2](ry033.htm#fr_167) This is the fifth of
the *avatárs*, descents or incarnations of Vishnu.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[43:3](ry033.htm#fr_168) This is a solar
allegory. Vishnu is the sun, the three steps being his rising,
culmination, and setting.
