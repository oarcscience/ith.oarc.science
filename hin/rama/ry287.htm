<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XIII.: THE RETURN TO KISHKINDH&Aacute;.</H3>
<P>
Thus with Sugr&iacute;va, from the side<BR>
Of Rishyamuka, R&aacute;ma hied,<BR>
And stood before Kishkindh&aacute;'s gate<BR>
Where B&aacute;li kept his regal state.<BR>
The hero in his warrior hold<BR>
Raised his great bow adorned with gold,<BR>
And drew his pointed arrow bright<BR>
As sunbeams, finisher of fight.<BR>
Strong-necked Sugr&iacute;va led the way<BR>
With Lakshman mighty in the fray.<BR>
Nala and N&iacute;la came behind<BR>
With Hanum&aacute;n of lofty mind.<BR>
And valiant T&aacute;ra, last in place,<BR>
A leader of the V&aacute;nar race.<BR>
They gazed on many a tree that showed<BR>
The glory of its pendent load,<BR>
And brook and limpid rill that made<BR>
Sweet murmurs as they seaward strayed.<BR>
They looked on caverns dark and deep,<BR>
On bower and glen and mountain steep,<BR>
And saw the opening lotus stud<BR>
With roseate cup the crystal flood,<BR>
While crane and swan and coot and drake<BR>
Made pleasant music on the lake,<BR>
And from the reedy bank was heard<BR>
The note of many a happy bird.<BR>
In open lawns, in tangled ways,<BR>
They saw the tall deer stand at gaze,<BR>
Or marked them free and fearless roam,<BR>
Fed with sweet grass, their woodland home.<BR>
At times two flashing tusks between<BR>
The wavings of the wood were seen,<BR>
And some mad elephant, alone,<BR>
Like a huge moving hill, was shown.<BR>
And scarcely less in size appeared<BR>
Great monkeys all with dust besmeared.<BR>
And various birds that roam the skies,<BR>
And silvan creatures, met their eyes,<BR>
As through the wood the chieftains sped,<BR>
Anil followed where Sugr&iacute;va led.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then R&aacute;ma, as their way they made,<BR>
Saw near at hand a lovely shade,<BR>
And, as he gazed upon the trees,<BR>
Spake to Sugr&iacute;va words like these;<BR>
'Those stately trees in beauty rise,<BR>
Fair as a cloud in autumn skies,<BR>
I fain, my friend, would learn from thee<BR>
What pleasant grove is that I see.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;ma spake, the mighty souled;<BR>
And thus his tale Sugr&iacute;va told:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'That, R&aacute;ma, is a wide retreat<BR>
That brings repose to weary feet.<BR>
Bright streams and fruit and roots are there,<BR>
And shady gardens passing fair.<BR>
There, neath the roof of hanging boughs,<BR>
The sacred Seven maintained their vows.<BR>
Their heads in dust were lowly laid,<BR>
In streams their nightly beds were made.<BR>
Each seventh night they broke their fast,<BR>
But air was still their sole repast,<BR>
And when seven hundred years were spent<BR>
To homes in heaven the hermits went.<BR>
Their glory keeps the garden yet,<BR>
With walls of stately trees beset.<BR>
Scarce would the Gods and demons dare,<BR>
By Indra led, to enter there.<BR>
No beast that roams the wood is found,<BR>
No bird of air, within the bound;<BR>
Or, thither if they idly stray,<BR>
They find no more their homeward way.<BR>
You hear at times mid dulcet tones<BR>
The chime of anklets, rings, and zones.<BR>
You hear the song and music sound,<BR>
And heavenly fragrance breathes around,<BR>
There duly burn the triple fires&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_578"></A><A HREF="ry288.htm#fn_578"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Where mounts the smoke in curling spires,<BR>
And, in a dun wreath, hangs above<BR>
The tall trees, like a brooding dove.<BR>
Round brunch and crest the vapours close<BR>
Till every tree enveloped shows<BR>
A hill of lazulite when clouds<BR>
Hang round it with their misty shrouds.<BR>
With Lakshman, lord of Raghu's line,<BR>
In reverent guise thine head incline,<BR>
And with fixt heart and suppliant hand<BR>
Give honour to the sainted band.<BR>
They who with faithful hearts revere<BR>
The holy Seven who harboured here,<BR>
Shall never, son of Raghu, know<BR>
In all their lives an hour of woe.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then R&aacute;ma and his brother bent.<BR>
And did obeisance reverent<BR>
With suppliant hand and lowly head,<BR>
Then with Sugr&iacute;va onward sped.<BR>
Beyond the sainted Seven's abode<BR>
Far on their way the chieftains strode,<BR>
And great Kishkindh&aacute;'s portal gained,<BR>
The royal town where B&aacute;li reigned.<BR>
Then by the gate they took their stand<BR>
All ready armed a noble band,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And burning every one<BR>
To slay in battle, hand to hand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Their foeman, Indra's son,<BR>
