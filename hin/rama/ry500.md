### CANTO CXXIX.: THE MEETING WITH BHARAT.

O'erwhelmed with rapture Bharat heard  
The tale that all his being stirred,  
And, heralding the glad event,  
This order to Satrughna sent:  
'Let every shrine with flowers be gay  
Let incense burn and music play.  
Go forth, go forth to meet your king,  
Let tabours sound and minstrels sing,  
Let bards swell high the note of praise  
Skilled in the lore of ancient days.  
Call forth the royal matrons: call  
Each noble from the council hall.  
Send all we love and honour most,  
Send Bráhmans and the warrior host,  
A glorious company to bring  
In triumph home our lord the king.'  
   Great rapture filled S'atrughna's breast,  
Obedient to his brother's hest.  
'Send forth ten thousand men' he cried,  
'Let brawny arms be stoutly plied,  
And, smoothing all with skilful care,  
The road for Kosal's king prepare.  
Then o'er the earth let thousands throw  
Fresh showers of water cool as snow,  
And others strew with garlands gay  
With loveliest blooms our monarch's way.  
On tower and temple porch and gate  
Let banners wave in royal state.  
And be each roof and terrace lined  
With blossoms loose and chaplets twined.'  
   The nobles hasting forth fulfilled  
His order as S'atrughna willed.  
Sublime on elephants they rode  
Whose gilded girths with jewels glowed.  
Attended close by thousands more  
Gay with the gear and flags they bore.  
A thousand chiefs their steeds bestrode,  
Their glittering cars a thousand showed.  
And countless hosts in rich array  
Pursued on foot their eager way.  
Veiled from the air with silken screens  
In litters rode the widowed queens.  
Kausalyá first, acknowledged head  
And sovereign of the household, led:  
Sumitrá next, and after, dames  
Of lower rank and humbler names.  
Then compassed by a white-robed throng  
Of Bráhmans, heralded with song,  
With shouts of joy from countless throats,  
And shells' and tambours' mingled notes,  
And drums resounding long and loud,  
Exulting Bharat joined the crowd.  
Still on his head, well-trained in lore  
Of duty, Ráma's shoes he bore.  
The moon-white canopy was spread  
With flowery twine engarlanded  

And jewelled chouries, meet to hold  
O'er Ráma's brow, shone bright with gold,  
Though Nandigráma's town they neared,  
Of Ráma yet no sign appeared.  
Then Bharat called the Vánar chief  
And questioned thus in doubt and grief:  
'Hast thou uncertain, like thy kind,  
A sweet delusive guile designed?  
Where, where is royal Ráma? show  
The hero, victor of the foe.  
I gaze, but see no Vánars still  
Who wear each varied shape at will.'  
   In eager love thus Bharat cried,  
And thus the Wind-God's son replied:  
'Look, Bharat, on those laden trees  
That murmur with the song of bees;  
For Ráma's sake the saint has made  
Untimely fruits, unwonted shade.  
Such power in ages long ago  
Could Indra's gracious boon bestow.  
O, hear the Vánars' voices, hear  
The shouting which proclaims them near  
E'en now about to cross they seem  
Sweet Gomati's delightful stream.  
I see, I see the car designed  
By Brahmá's own creative mind,  
The car which, radiant as the moon,  
Moves at the will by Brahmá's boon;  
The car which once was Rávan's pride,  
The victor's spoil when Rávan died.  
Look, there are Raghu's sons: between  
The brothers stands the rescued queen.  
There is Vibhíshan full in view,  
Sugríva and his retinue.'  
   He ceased: then rapture loosed each tongue:  
From men and dames, from old and young,  
One long, one universal cry,  
'Tis he,'tis Ráma, smote the sky.  
All lighted down with eager speed  
From elephant and car and steed,  
And every joyful eye intent  
On Ráma's moonbright face was bent.  
Entranced a moment Bharat gazed:  
Then reverential hands he raised,  
And on his brother humbly pressed  
The honours due to welcome guest.  
Then Bharat clomb the car to greet  
His king and bowed him at his feet,  
Till Ráma raised him face to face  
And held him in a close embrace.  
Then Lakshman and the Maithil dame  
He greeted as he spoke his name  <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[1](#fn_1049)  
He greeted next, supreme in place,  
The sovereign of the Vánar race,  
And Jámbaván and Báli's son,  

<span id="page_506">p. 506</span>  

And lords and chiefs, omitting none. <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[1](#fn_1050)  
Sugríva to his heart he pressed  
And thus with grateful words addressed:  
'Four brothers, Vánar king, were we,  
And now we boast a fifth in thee.  
By kindly acts a friend we know:  
Offence and wrong proclaim the foe,'  
To King Vibhíshan then he spake:  
'Well hast thou fought fov Ráma's sake.'  
Nor was the brave S'atrughna slow  
His reverential love to show  
To both his brothers, as was meet,  
And venerate the lady's feet.  
Then Ráma to his mother came,  
Saw her pale cheek and wasted frame,  
With gentle words her heart consoled,  
And clasped her feet with loving hold.  
Then at Sumitra's feet he bent,  
And fair Kaikeyi's, reverent,  
Greeted each dame from chief to least,  
And bowed him to the household priest.  
Up rose a shout from all the throng:  
'O welcome, Ráma, mourned so long.  
Welcome, Kausalyá's joy and pride,'  
Ten hundred thousand voices cried.  
Then Bharat placed, in duty taught,  
On Ráma's feet the shoes he brought:  
'My King,' he cried, 'receive again  
The pledge preserved through years of pain,  
The rule and lordship of the land  
Entrusted to my weaker hand.  
No more I sigh o'er sorrows past,  
My birth and life are blest at last  
In the glad sight this day has shown,  
When Ráma comes to rule his own.'  
   He ceased: the faithful love that moved  
The prince's soul each heart approved;  
Nor could the Vánar chiefs refrain  
From tender tears that fell like rain.  
Then Ráma, stirred with joy anew,  
His arms about his brother threw,  
And to the grove his course he bent  
Where Bharat's hermit days were spent.  
Alighting in that pure retreat  
He pressed the earth with eager feet.  
Then, at his hest, the car rose high  
And sailing through the northern sky  
Sped homeward to the Lord of Gold  
Who owned the wondrous prize of old.  <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1049"></span>[505:1](ry500.htm#fr_1049) In these respectful
salutations the person who salutes his superior mentions his own name
even when it is well known to the person whom he salutes.

<span id="fn_1050"></span>[506:1](ry500.htm#fr_1050) I have omitted the
chieftains' names as they could not be introduced without padding. They
are Mainda, Dwivid, Níla Rishabh, Sushen, Nala, Gaváksha, Gandhamádan,
S'arabh, and Panas.

<span id="fn_1051"></span>[506:2](ry500.htm#fr_1051) The following
addition is found in the Bengal recension: But Vais'ravan (Kuvera) when
he beheld his chariot said unto it: 'Go, and carry Ráma, and come unto
me when my thought shall call thee, And the chariot returned unto Ráma:'
and he honoured it when he had heard what had passed.
