They slept secure: the sun arose<BR>
And called the chieftains from repose.<BR>
Before the wondering V&aacute;nars, gay<BR>
With grove and garden, Lank&aacute; lay,<BR>
Where golden buds the Champak showed,<BR>
And bright with bloom As'oka glowed,<BR>
And palm and S&aacute;l and many a tree<BR>
With leaf and flower were fair to see.<BR>
They looked on wood and lawn and glade,<BR>
On emerald grass and dusky shade,<BR>
Where creepers filled the air with scent.<BR>
And luscious fruit the branches bent,<BR>
Where bees inebriate loved to throng,<BR>
And each sweet bird was loud in song.<BR>
The wondering V&aacute;nars passed the bound<BR>
That circled that enchanting ground,<BR>
And as they came a sweet breeze through<BR>
The odorous alleys softly blew.<BR>
Some V&aacute;nars, at their king's behest,<BR>
Onward to bannered Lank&aacute; pressed,<BR>
While, startled by the strangers' tread,<BR>
The birds and deer before them fled.<BR>
Earth trembled at each step they took,<BR>
And Lank&aacute; at their shouting shook.<BR>
Bright rose before their wondering eyes<BR>
Trikata's * peak that kissed the skies,<BR>
And, clothed with flowers of every hue,<BR>
And its golden alin * thr *.<BR>
More fair to see the * mountain's head<BR>

A hundred leagues in length was spread.<BR>
There R&aacute;van's town, securely placed,<BR>
The summit of Trik&uacute;ta graced.<BR>
O'er leagues of land she stretched in pride,<BR>
A hundred long and twenty wide.<BR>
They saw a lofty wall enfold<BR>
The city, built of blocks of gold,<BR>
They saw the beams of morning fall<BR>
On dome and fane within the wall,<BR>
Bright with the shine that mansion gives<BR>
Where Vishnu in his glory lives.<BR>
White-created like the Lord of Snows<BR>
Before them R&aacute;van's palace rose.<BR>
High on a thousand pillars raised<BR>
With gold and precious stone it blazed,<BR>
Guarded by giant warders, crown<BR>
And ornament of Lank&aacute;'s town.<BR>
