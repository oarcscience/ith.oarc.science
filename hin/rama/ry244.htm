<P>
The angry Lakshman scarce could brook<BR>
Her bitter words, her furious look.<BR>
With dark forebodings in his breast<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's side he quickly pressed.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then ten necked R&aacute;van saw the time<BR>
Propitious for his purposed crime.<BR>
A mendicant in guise he came<BR>
And stood before the Maithil dame.<BR>
His garb was red, with tufted hair<BR>
And sandalled feet a shade he bare,<BR>
And from the fiend's left shoulder slung<BR>
A staff and water-vessel hung.<BR>
Near to the lovely dame he drew,<BR>
While both the chiefs were far from view,<BR>
As darkness takes the evening air<BR>
When neither sun nor moon is there.<BR>
He bent his eye upon the dame,<BR>
A princess fair, of spotless fame:<BR>
So might some baleful planet be<BR>
Near Moon-forsaken Rohini. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_496"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
As the fierce tyrant nearer drew,<BR>
The trees in Janasth&aacute;n that grew<BR>
Waved not a leaf for fear and woe,<BR>
And the hushed wind forbore to blow.<BR>
God&aacute;var&iacute;'s waters as they fled,<BR>
Saw his fierce eye-balls flashing red,<BR>
And from each swiftly-gliding wave<BR>
A melancholy murmur gave.<BR>
Then R&aacute;van, when his eager eye<BR>
Beheld the longed-for moment nigh,<BR>
In mendicant's apparel dressed<BR>
Near to the Maithil lady pressed.<BR>

In holy guise, a fiend abhorred,<BR>
He found her mourning for her lord.<BR>
Thus threatening draws S'anis'char &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_497"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> nigh<BR>
To Chitr&aacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in the evening sky:<BR>
Thus the deep well by grass concealed<BR>
Yawns treacherous in the verdant field.<BR>
He stood and looked upon the dame<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma, queen of spotless fame<BR>
With her bright teeth and each fair limb<BR>
Like the full moon she seemed to him,<BR>
Sitting within her leafy cot.<BR>
Weeping for woe that left her not.<BR>
Thus, while with joy his pulses beat,<BR>
He saw her in her lone retreat,<BR>
Eyed like the lotus, fair to view<BR>
In bilken robes of amber hue.<BR>
Pierced to the core by K&aacute;ma's dart<BR>
He murmured texts with lying art,<BR>
And questioned with a soft address<BR>
The lady in her loneliness.<BR>
The fiend essayed with gentle speech<BR>
The heart of that fair dame to reach,<BR>
Pride of the worlds, like Beauty's Queen<BR>
Without her darling lotus seen:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'O thou whose silken robes enfold<BR>
A form more rare than finest gold,<BR>
With lotus garland on thy head,<BR>
Like a sweet spring with bloom o'erspread,<BR>
Who art thou, fair one, what thy name,<BR>
Beauty, or Honour, Fortune, Fame,<BR>
Spirit, or nymph, or Queen of love<BR>
Descended from thy home above?<BR>
Bright as the dazzling jasmine shine<BR>
Thy small square teeth in level line.<BR>
Like two black stars aglow with light<BR>
Thine eyes are large and pure and bright.<BR>
Thy charms of smile and teeth and hair<BR>
And winning eyes, O thou most fair,<BR>
Steal all my spirit, as the flow<BR>
Of rivers mines the bank below.<BR>
How bright, how fine each flowing trees!<BR>
How firm those orbs beneath thy dress!<BR>
That dainty waist with ease were spanned,<BR>
Sweet lady, by a lover's hand.<BR>
Mine eyes, O beauty, ne'er have seen<BR>
Goddess or nymph so fair of mien,<BR>
Or bright Gandharva's heavenly dame,<BR>
Or woman of so perfect frame.<BR>
In youth's soft prime thy years are few,<BR>
And earth has naught so fair to view.<BR>
I marvel one like thee in face<BR>
Should make the woods her dwelling-place.<BR>
Leave, lady, leave this lone retreat<BR>
In forest wilds for thee unmeet,<BR>
Where giants fierce and strong assume<BR>
All shapes and wander in the gloom.<BR>
These dainty feet were formed to tread<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Some palace floor with carpets spread,<BR>
Or wander in trim gardens where<BR>
Each opening bud perfumes the air<BR>
The richest robe thy form should deck,<BR>
The rarest gems adorn thy neck.<BR>
The sweetest wreath should bind thy hair,<BR>
The noblest lord thy bed should share.<BR>
Art thou akin, O fair of form,<BR>
To Rudras,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> or the Gods of storm,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_500"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
Or to the glorious Vasus &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A>? How<BR>
Can less than these be bright as thou?<BR>
But never nymph or heavenly maid<BR>
Or Goddess haunts this gloomy shade.<BR>
Here giants roam, a savage race;<BR>
What led thee to so dire a place?<BR>
Here monkeys leap from tree to tree,<BR>
And bears and tigers wander free;<BR>
Here ravening lions prowl, and fell<BR>
Hyenas in the thickets yell,<BR>
And elephants infuriate roam,<BR>
Mighty and fierce, their woodland home.<BR>
Dost thou not dread, so soft and fair,<BR>
Tiger and lion, wolf and bear?<BR>
Hast thou, O beauteous dame, no fear<BR>
In the wild wood so lone and drear?<BR>
Whose and who art thou? whence and why<BR>
Sweet lady, with no guardian nigh,<BR>
Dost thou this awful forest tread<BR>
By giant bands inhabited?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The praise the high-souled R&aacute;van spoke<BR>
No doubt within her bosom woke. '<BR>
His saintly look and Br&aacute;hman guise<BR>
Deceived the lady's trusting eyes.<BR>
With due attention on the guest<BR>
Her hospitable rites she pressed.<BR>
She bade the stranger to a seat,<BR>
And gave him water for his feet.<BR>
The bowl and water-pot he bare,<BR>
And garb which wandering Br&aacute;hmans wear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Forbade a doubt to rise.<BR>
Won by his holy look she deemed<BR>
The stranger even as he seemed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To her deluded eyes.<BR>
Intent on hospitable care,<BR>
She brought her best of woodland fare.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And showed her guest a seat.<BR>
She bade the saintly stranger lave<BR>
His feet in water which she gave,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And sit and rest and eat.<BR>
He kept his eager glances bent<BR>
On her so kindly eloquent,<BR>
Wife of the noblest king;<BR>
And longed in heart to steal her thence,<BR>
Preparing by the dire offence,<BR>
Death on his head to bring.<BR>

The lady watched with anxious face<BR>
For R&aacute;ma coming from the chase<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With Lakshman by his side:<BR>
But nothing met her wandering glance<BR>
Save the wild forest's green expanse<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Extending far aud wide.<BR>
