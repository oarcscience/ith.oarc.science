### CANTO XLI.: THE ARMY OF THE SOUTH.

He gathered next a chosen band  
For service in the southern land.  
He summoned Níla son of Fire,  
And, offspring of the eternal Sire,  
Jámbaván bold and strong and tall.  
And Hanumán, the best of all,  
And many a valiant lord beside, <span id="fr_691"></span>[1b](#fn_691.md)  
With Angad for their chief and guide.  
'Go forth,' he cried, 'with all this host  
Exploring to the southern coast:  
The thousand peaks that Vindhya shows  
Where every tree and creeper grows:  
Where Narmadá's  <span id="fr_692"></span>[2b](#fn_692.md) sweet waters
run,  
And serpents bask them in the sun:  
Where Krishnavení, <span id="fr_693"></span>[3b](#fn_693.md) currents
flee,  
And sparkles fair Godávaií. <span id="fr_694"></span>[4b](#fn_694.md)  

Through Mekhal, <span id="fr_695"></span>[5b](#fn_695.md) pass and
Utkal's, <span id="fr_696"></span>[6b](#fn_696.md) land:  
Go where Das'árna's, <span id="fr_697"></span>[7b](#fn_697.md) cities
stand.  
Avantí, <span id="fr_698"></span>[8b](#fn_698.md) seek, of high renown,  
And Abravanti's, <span id="fr_699"></span>[9b](#fn_699.md) glorious town.  
Search every hill and brook and cave  
Where Dandak's woods their branches wave  
Avomukh's, <span id="fr_700"></span>[10b](#fn_700.md) woody hill explore  
Whose sides are bright with richest ore,.  
lifting his glorious head on high  
From bloomy groves that round him lie.  

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>  

Search well his forests where the breeze  
Blows fragrant from the sandal trees.  
Then will you see Káverí's <span id="fr_701"></span>[1](#fn_701.md)
stream  
Whose pleasant waters glance and gleam,  
And to the lovely banks entice  
The sportive maids of Paradise.  
High on the top of Malaya's <span id="fr_702"></span>[2](#fn_702.md)
hill,  
In holy musing, calm and still,  
Sits, radiant as the Lord of Light,  
Agastya, <span id="fr_703"></span>[3](#fn_703.md) noblest anchorite.  
Soon as that lofty-thoughted lord  
His high permission shall accord,  
Pass Támraparní's <span id="fr_704"></span>[4](#fn_704.md) flood whose
isles  
Are loved by basking crocodiles.  
The sandal woods that fringe her side  
Those islets and her waters hide;  
While, like an amorous matron, she  
Speeds to her own dear lord the sea.  
Thence hasting on your way behold  
The Pándyas' <span id="fr_705"></span>[5](#fn_705.md) gates of pearl and
gold.  
Then, with your task maturely planned,  
On ocean's shore your feet will stand.  
Where, by Agastya's high decree,  
Mahendra, <span id="fr_706"></span>[6](#fn_706.md) planted in the sea,  
With tinted peaks against the tide  
Rises in solitary pride,  
And glorious in his golden glow  
Spurns back the waves that beat below.  
Fair mountain, bright with creepers' bloom  
And every tint that trees assume,  
Where Yaksha, God, and heavenly maid  
Meet wandering in the lovely shade,  
At changing moon and solemn tide  
By Indra's presence glorified.  
One hundred leagues in fair extent  
An island <span id="fr_707"></span>[7](#fn_707.md) fronts the continent:  
No man may tread its glitering shore  
With utmost heed that isle explore,  
For the fair country owns the sway  
Of Rávan whom we burn to day.  

A mighty monster stands to keep  
The passage of the southern deep,  
Lifting her awful arms on high  
She grasps e'en shadows as they fly.  
Speed through that isle, and onward still  
Where in mid sea the Flowery Hill <span
id="fr_708"></span>[1b](#fn_708.md)  
Haises on high his bloomy head  
By saints and angels visited.  
There, with a hundred gleaming peaks  
Bright as the sun, the sky he seeks,  
One glorious peak the Lord of Day  
Gilds ever with his loving ray;  
Thereon ne'er yet the glances fell  
Of thankless wretch or infidel.  
Bow to that hill in reverence due,  
And then once more your search pursue.  
Beyond that glorious mountain hie,  
And Súryaván, <span id="fr_709"></span>[2b](#fn_709.md) proud hill is
nigh.  
Your rapid course yet farther bend  
Where Vaidyut's <span id="fr_710"></span>[3b](#fn_710.md) airy peaks
ascend.  
There trees of noblest sort, profuse  
Of wealth, their kindly gifts produce.  
Their precious fruits, O Vánars, taste,  
The honey sip, and onward haste.  
Next will ye see Mount Kunjar rise,  
Who cheers with beauty hearts and eyes.  
There is Agastya's <span id="fr_711"></span>[4b](#fn_711.md) mansion,
decked  
Bv heaven's all moulding architect.  
Near Bhogavatí <span id="fr_712"></span>[5b](#fn_712.md) stands, the
place  
Where dwell the hosts of serpent race:  
A broad-wayed city, walled and barred,  
Which watchful legions keep and guard,  
The fiercest of the serpent youth,  
Each awful for his venomed tooth:  
And throned in his imperial hall  
Is Vásuki <span id="fr_713"></span>[6b](#fn_713.md) who rules them all.  
Explore the serpent city well,  
Search town and tower and citadel,  
And scan each field and wood that lies  
Around it, with your watchful eyes.  
Beyond that spot your way pursue:  
A noble mountain shall ye view,  
Named Rishabh, like a mighty bull,  
With gems made bright and beautiful.  

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>  

All trees of sandal flourish there  
Of heavenly fragrance, rich and rare.  
But, though they tempt your longing eyes,  
Avoid to touch them, and be wise.  
For Rohitas, a guardian band  
Of fierce Gandharvas, round them stand,  
Who five bright sovereign lords <span
id="fr_714"></span>[1](ry316.htm#fn_714.md) obey,  
In glory like the God of Day.  
Here by good deeds a home is won.  
With shapes like fire, the moon, the sun.  
Here they who merit heaven by worth  
Dwell on the confines of the earth.  
There stay; beyond it, dark and drear,  
Lies the departed spirits' sphere,  
And, girt with darkness, far from bliss,  
Is Yama's sad metropolis. <span
id="fr_715"></span>[2](ry316.htm#fn_715.md)  
So far, my lords, o'er land and sea  
Vour destined course is plain and free.  
Beyond your steps you may not set,  
Where living thing ne'er journeyed yet.  
With utmost care these realms survey,  
And all you meet upon the way.  
And, when the lady's course is traced,  
Back to your king, O Vánars, haste.  
And he who tells me he has seen.  
After long search, the Maithil queen,  
Shall gain a noble guerdon: he  
In power and bliss shall equal me.  
Dear as my very life, above  
His fellows in his master's love;  
I call him, yea though stained with crime.  
My kinsman from that happy time.'
