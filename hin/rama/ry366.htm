<P>
Still with reproaches rough and rude<BR>
Those fiends the gentle queen pursued:<BR>
What! can so fair a life displease,<BR>
To dwell with him in joyous ease?<BR>
Dwell in his bowers a happy queen<BR>
In silk and gold and jewels' sheen?<BR>
Still must thy woman fancy cling<BR>
To R&aacute;ma and reject our king?<BR>
Die in thy folly, or forget<BR>
That wretched wandering anchoret.<BR>
Come, Sita, in luxurious bowers<BR>
Spend with our lord thy happy hours;<BR>
The mighty lord who makes his own<BR>
The treasures of the worlds o'erthrown.'<BR>

<P>
Then, as a tear bedewed her eye,<BR>
The hapless lady made reply:<BR>
'I loathe, with heart and soul detest<BR>
The shameful life your words suggest.<BR>
Eat, if you will, this mortal frame:<BR>
My soul rejects the sin and shame.<BR>
A homeless wanderer though he be,<BR>
In him my lord, my life I see,<BR>
And, till my earthly days be done,<BR>
Will cling to great Ikshv&aacute;ku's son.<BR>

<P>
Then with fierce eyes on S&iacute;t&aacute; set<BR>
They cried again with taunt and threat:<BR>
Each licking with her fiery tongue<BR>
The lip that to her bosom hung,<BR>
And menacing the lady's life<BR>
With axe, or spear or murderous knife:<BR>
'Hear, S&iacute;t&aacute;, and our words obey.<BR>
Or perish by our hands to-day,<BR>
Thy love for Raghu's son forsake,<BR>
And R&aacute;van for thy husband take,<BR>
Or we will rend thy limbs apart<BR>
And banquet on thy quivering heart.<BR>
Now from her body strike the head,<BR>
And tell the king the dame is dead.<BR>
Then by our lord's commandment she<BR>
A banquet for our band shall be.<BR>
Come, let the wine be quickly brought<BR>
That frees each heart from saddening thought.<BR>
Then to the western gate repair,<BR>
And we will dance and revel there.'<BR>
