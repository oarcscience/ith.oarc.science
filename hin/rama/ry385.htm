<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLVII.: THE DEATH OF AKSHA.</H3>
<P>
But R&aacute;van, as his fury burned,<BR>
His eyes on youthful Aksha &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_884"></A><A HREF="#fn_884"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> turned,<BR>
Who rose impetuous at his glance<BR>
And shouted for his bow and lance.<BR>

<P>

<P>
He rode upon a glorious car<BR>
That shot the light of gems afar.<BR>
His pennon waved mid glittering gold<BR>
And bright the wheels with jewels rolled.<BR>
By long and fierce devotion won<BR>
That car was splendid as the sun.<BR>
With rows of various weapons stored;<BR>
And thought-swift horses whirled their lord<BR>
Racing along the earth, or rose<BR>
High through the clouds whene'er he chose.<BR>
Then fierce and fearful war between<BR>
The V&aacute;nar and the fiend was seen.<BR>
The Gods and Asurs stood amazed,<BR>
And on the wondrous combat gazed.<BR>
A cry from earth rose long and shrill,<BR>
The wind was hushed, the sun grew chill.<BR>
The thunder bellowed from the sky,<BR>
And troubled ocean roared reply.<BR>
Thrice Aksha strained his dreadful bow,<BR>
Thrice smote his arrow on the foe,<BR>
And with full streams of crimson bled<BR>
Three gashes in the V&aacute;nar's head.<BR>
Then rose Hanum&aacute;n in the air<BR>
To shun the shafts no life could bear.<BR>
But Aksha in his car pursued,<BR>
And from on high the fight renewed<BR>
With storm of arrows, thick as hail<BR>
When angry clouds some hill assail.<BR>
Impatient of that arrowy shower<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chief put forth his power,<BR>
Again above his chariot rose<BR>
And smote him with repeated blows.<BR>
Terrific came each deadly stroke:<BR>
Breast neck and arm and back he broke;<BR>
And Aksha fell to earth, and lay<BR>
With all his life-blood drained away.<BR>
