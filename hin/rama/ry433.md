### CANTO XXXIV.: SARAMÁ'S TIDINGS.

Thus Saramá her story told:  
And Sitá's spirit was consoled.  
As when the first fresh rain is shed  
The parching earth is comforted.  
Then, filled with zeal for Sitá's sake,  
Again in gentle tones she spake,  
And, skilled in arts that soothe and please,  
Addressed the queen in words like these;  
'Thy husband, lady, will I seek,  
Say the fond words thy lips would apeak,  
And then, unseen of any eye,  
Back to thy side will swiftly fly.  
My airy flights are speedier far  
Than Garuda's and the tempest are.'  

Then Sitá spake: her former woe  
Still left her accents faint and low:  
'I know thy steps, which naught can stay,  
Can urge through heaven and hell their way.  
Then if thy love and changeless will  
Would serve the helpless captive still,  
Go forth and learn each plot and guile  
Planned by the lord of Lanká's isle.  
With magic art like maddening wine  
He cheats these weeping eyes of mine.  
Torments me with his suit, nor spares  
Reproof or flattery, threats or prayers.  
These guards surround me night and day;  
My heart is sad, my senses stray;  
And helpless in my woe I fear  
The tyrant Rávan even here.'  

Then Saramá replied:'I go  
To learn the purpose of thy foe,  
Soon by thy side again to stand  
And tell thee what the king has planned.'  
She sped, she heard with eager ears  
The tyrant speak his hopes and fears.  
Where, gathered at their master's call,  
The nobles filled the council hall;  
Then swiftly, to her promise true,  
Back to the As'oka grove she flew.  
The lady on the grassy ground,  
Longing for her return, she found;  
Who with a gentle smile, to greet  
The envoy, led her to a seat  
Through her worn frame a shiver ran  
As Saramá her tale began:  
'There stood the royal mother: she  
Besought her son to set thee free,  

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>  

And to her counsel, tears and prayers,  
The elder nobles added theirs:  
'O be the Maithíl queen restored  
With honour to her angry lord.  
Let Janasthán's\* unhappy fight  
Be witness of the hero's might.  
Hanuúmán o'er the waters came  
And looked upon the guarded dame.  
Let Lanká's chiefs who fought and fell  
The prowess of the leader tell.'  
In vain they sued, in vain she wept,  
His purpose still unchanged he kept.  
As clings the miser to his gold,  
He would not loose thee from his hold.  
No, never till in death he lies,  
Will Lanká's lord release his prize.  
Soon slain by Ráma's arrows all  
The giants with their king will fall,  
And Ráma to his home will lead  
His black-eyed queen from bondage freed.'  

An awful sound that moment rose  
From Lanká's fast-approaching foes,  
Where drum and shell in mingled peal  
Made earth in terror rock and reel.  
The hosts within the walls arrayed  
Stood trembling, in their hearts dismayed;  
Thought of the tempest soon to burst,  
Aud Lanká's lord, their ruin, cursed.
