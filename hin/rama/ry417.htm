<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XVIII.: R&Aacute;MA'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
Then R&aacute;ma's rising doubt was stilled,<BR>
And friendly thoughts his bosom filled.<BR>
Thus, deep in Scripture's lore, he spake:<BR>
'The suppliant will I ne'er forsake,<BR>
Nor my protecting aid refuse<BR>
When one in name of friendship sues.<BR>
Though faults and folly blot his fame,<BR>
Pity and help he still may claim.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: Sugr&iacute;va bowed his head<BR>
And pondered for a while, and said:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Past number be his faults or few,<BR>
What think ye of the R&aacute;kshas who,<BR>
When threatening clouds of danger rise,<BR>
Deserts his brother's side and flies?<BR>
Say, V&aacute;nars, who may hope to find<BR>
True friendship in his faithless kind?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The son of Raghu heard his speech:<BR>
He cast a hasty look on each<BR>
Of those brave V&aacute;nar chiefs, and while<BR>
Upon his lips there played a smile,<BR>
To Lakshman turned and thus expressed<BR>
The thoughts that moved his gallant breast:<BR>
'Well versed in Scripture's lore, and sage<BR>
And duly reverent to age,<BR>
Is he, with long experience stored,<BR>
Who counsels like this V&aacute;nar lord.<BR>
Yet here, methinks, for searching eyea<BR>
Some deeper, subtler matter lies.<BR>
To you and all the world are known<BR>
The perils of a monarch's throne,<BR>
While foe and stranger, kith and kin<BR>
By his misfortune trust to win.<BR>
By hope of *such advantage led,<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan o'er the sea has fled.<BR>

<P>
He in his brother's stead would reign,<BR>
And our alliance seeks to gain;<BR>
And we his offer may embrace,<BR>
A stranger and of alien race.<BR>
But if he comes a spy and foe,<BR>
What power has he to strike a blow<BR>
In furtherance of his close design?<BR>
What is his strength compared with mine?<BR>
And can I, V&aacute;nar King, forget<BR>
The great, the universal debt,<BR>
Ever to aid and welcome those<BR>
Who pray for shelter, friends or foes?<BR>
Hast thou not heard the deathless praise<BR>
Won by the dove in olden days,<BR>
Who conquering his fear and hate<BR>
Welcomed the slayer of his mate,<BR>
And gave a banquet, to refresh<BR>
The weary fowler, of his flesh?<BR>
Now hear me, V&aacute;nar King, rehearse<BR>
What Kandu &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_939"></A><A HREF="#fn_939"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> spoke in ancient verse,<BR>
Saint Kanva's son who loved the truth<BR>
And clave to virtue from his youth:<BR>
'Strike not the suppliant when he stands<BR>
And asks thee with beseeching hands<BR>
For shelter: strike him not although<BR>
He were thy father's mortal foe.<BR>
No, yield him, be he proud or meek,<BR>
The shelter which he comes to seek,<BR>
And save thy foeman, if the deed<BR>
Should cost thy life, in desperate need.'<BR>
And shall I hear the wretched cry,<BR>
And my protecting aid deny?<BR>
Shall I a suppliant's prayer refuse,<BR>
And heaven and glory basely lose?<BR>
No, I will do for honour sake<BR>
E'en as the holy Kandu spake,<BR>
Preserve a hero's name from stain,<BR>
And bliss in heaven and glory gain.<BR>
Bound by a solemn vow I sware<BR>
That all my saving help should share<BR>
Who sought me in distress and cried,<BR>
'Thou art my hope, and none beside,'<BR>
Then go, I pray thee, V&aacute;nar King,<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan to my presence bring.<BR>
Yea, were he R&aacute;van's self, my vow<BR>
Forbids me to reject him now.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: the V&aacute;nar king approved;<BR>
And R&aacute;ma toward Vibh&iacute;shan moved.<BR>
So moves, a brother God to greet,<BR>
Lord Indra from his heavenly seat.<BR>
