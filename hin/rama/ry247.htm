<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLIX.: THE RAPE OF SIT&Aacute;.</H3>
<P>
The R&aacute;kshas monarch, thus addressed,<BR>
His hands a while together pressed,<BR>
And straight before her startled eyes<BR>
Stood monstrous in his giant size.<BR>
Then to the lady, with the lore<BR>
Of eloquence, he spoke once more:<BR>
'Thou scarce,' he cried, 'hast heard aright<BR>
The glories of my power and might,<BR>
I borne sublime in air can stand<BR>
And with these arms upheave the land,<BR>
Drink the deep flood of Ocean dry<BR>
And Death with conquering force defy.<BR>
Pierce the great sun with furious dart<BR>
And to her depths cleave earth apart.<BR>
See, thou whom love and beauty blind,<BR>
I wear each form as wills my mind."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As thus he spake in burning ire,<BR>
His glowing eyes were red with fire.<BR>
His gentle garb aside was thrown<BR>
And all his native shape was shown.<BR>
Terrific, monstrous, wild, and dread<BR>
As the dark God who rules the dead,<BR>
His fiery eyes in fury rolled,<BR>
His limbs were decked with glittering gold.<BR>
Like some dark cloud the monster showed,<BR>
And his fierce breast with fury glowed.<BR>
The ten-faced rover of the night,<BR>
With twenty arms exposed to sight,<BR>
His saintly guise aside had laid<BR>
And all his giant height displayed.<BR>

<P>
Attired in robes of crimson dye<BR>
He stood and watched with angry eye<BR>
The lady in her bright array<BR>
Resplendent as the dawn of day<BR>
When from the east the sunbeams break,<BR>
And to the dark-haired lady spake:<BR>
'If thou would call that lord thine own<BR>
Whose fame in every world is known,<BR>
Look kindly on my love, and be<BR>
Bride of a consort meet for thee.<BR>
With me let blissful years be spent,<BR>
For ne'er thy choice shalt thou repent.<BR>
No deed of mine shall e'er displease<BR>
My darling as she lives at ease.<BR>
Thy love for mortal man resign,<BR>
And to a worthier lord incline.<BR>
Ah foolish lady, seeming wise<BR>
In thine own weak and partial eyes,<BR>
By what fair graces art thou held<BR>
To R&aacute;ma from his realm expelled?<BR>
Misfortunes all his life attend.<BR>
And his brief days are near their end.<BR>
Unworthy prince, infirm of mind!<BR>
A woman spoke and he resigned<BR>
His home and kingdom and withdrew<BR>
From troops of friends and retinue.<BR>
And sought this forest dark and dread<BR>
By savage beasts inhabited.'<BR>
Thus R&aacute;van urged the lady meet<BR>
For love, whose words were soft and sweet.<BR>
Near and more near the giant pressed<BR>
As love's hot fire inflamed his breast.<BR>
The leader of the giant crew<BR>
His arm around the lady threw:<BR>
Thus Budha &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with ill-omened might<BR>
Steals Rohini's delicious light.<BR>
One hand her glorious tresses grasped,<BR>
One with its ruthless pressure clasped<BR>
The body of his lovely prize,<BR>
The Maithil dame with lotus eyes.<BR>
The silvan Gods in wild alarm<BR>
Marked his huge teeth and ponderous arm,<BR>
And from that Death-like presence fled,<BR>
Of mountain size and towering head.<BR>
Then seen was R&aacute;van's magic car<BR>
Aglow with gold which blazed afar,--<BR>
The mighty car which asses drew<BR>
Thundering as it onward flew.<BR>
He spared not harsh rebuke to chide<BR>
The lady as she moaned and cried,<BR>
Then with his arm about her waist<BR>
His captive in the car he placed.<BR>
In vain he threatened: long and shrill<BR>
Rang out her lamentation still,<BR>
O R&aacute;ma! which no fear could stay:<BR>
But her dear lord was far away<BR>
Then rose the fiend, and toward the skies<BR>
Bore his poor helpless struggling prize:<BR>

<P>

<P>
Hurrying through the air above<BR>
The dame who loathed his proffered love<BR>
So might a soaring eagle bear<BR>
A serpent's consort through the air.<BR>
As on he bore her through the sky<BR>
She shrieked aloud her bitter cry.<BR>
As when some wretch's lips complain<BR>
In agony of maddening pain;<BR>
'O Lakshman, thou whose joy is still<BR>
To do thine eider brother's will,<BR>
This fiend, who all disguises wears,<BR>
From R&aacute;ma's side his darling tears.<BR>
Thou who couldst leave bliss, fortune, all,<BR>
Yea life itselt at duty's call,<BR>
Dost thou not see this outrage done<BR>
To hapless me, O Raghu's son?<BR>
'Tis thine, O victor of the foe,<BR>
To bring the haughtiest spirit low,<BR>
How canst thou such an outrage see<BR>
And let the guilty fiend go free?<BR>
Ah, seldom in a moment's time<BR>
Comes bitter fruit of sin and crime,<BR>
But in the day of harvest pain<BR>
Comes like the ripening of the grain.<BR>
So thou whom fate and folly lead<BR>
To ruin for this guilty deed,<BR>
Shalt die by R&aacute;ma's arm ere long<BR>
A dreadful death for hideous wrong.<BR>
Ah, too successful in their ends<BR>
Are Queen Kaikey&iacute; and her friends,<BR>
When virtuous R&aacute;ma, dear to fame,<BR>
Is mourning for his ravished dame.<BR>
Ah me, ah me! a long farewell<BR>
To lawn and glade and forest dell<BR>
In Janasth&aacute;n's wild region, where<BR>
The Cassia trees are bright and fair<BR>
With all your tongues to R&aacute;ma say<BR>
That R&aacute;van bears his wife away.<BR>
Farewell, a long farewell to thee,<BR>
O pleasant stream God&aacute;vari,<BR>
Whose rippling waves are ever stirred<BR>
By many a glad wild water bird!<BR>
All ye to R&aacute;ma's ear relate<BR>
The giant's deed and S&iacute;t&aacute;'s fata.<BR>
O all ye Gods who love this ground<BR>
Where trees of every leaf abound,<BR>
Tell R&aacute;ma I am stolen hence,<BR>
I pray you all with reverence.<BR>
On all the living things beside<BR>
That these dark boughs and coverts hide,<BR>
Ye flocks of birds ye troops of deer,<BR>
I call on you my prayer to hear.<BR>
All we to R&aacute;ma's ear proclaim<BR>
That R&aacute;van tears away his dame<BR>
Witn forceful arms--his darling wife,<BR>
Dearer to R&aacute;ma than his life.<BR>
O, if he knew I dwelt in hell,<BR>
My mighty lord, I know full well,<BR>
Would bring me, conqueror, back to-day,<BR>
Though Yama's self reclaimed his prey.'<BR>
Thus from the air the lady sent<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_288"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 288</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
With piteous voice her last lament,<BR>
And as she wept she chanced to see<BR>
The vulture on a lofty tree.<BR>
As R&aacute;van bore her swiftly by,<BR>
On the dear bird she bent her eye,<BR>
And with a voice which woe made faint<BR>
Renewed to him her wild complaint:<BR>
'O see, the king who rules the race<BR>
Of giants, cruel, fierce and base,<BR>
R&aacute;van the spoiler bears me hence<BR>
The helpless prey of violence.<BR>
This fiend who roves in midnight shade<BR>
By thee, dear bird, can ne'er be stayed,<BR>
For he is armed and fierce and strong<BR>
Triumphant in the power to wrong.<BR>
For thee remains one only task,<BR>
To do, kind friend, the thing I ask.<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's ear by thee be borne<BR>
How S&iacute;t&aacute; from her home is torn,<BR>
And to the valiant Lakshman tell<BR>
The giant's deed and what befell.'<BR>
