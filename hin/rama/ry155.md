### CANTO LXXVII.: THE GATHERING OF THE ASHES.

The tenth day passed: the prince again  
Was free from every legal stain.  
Ha bade them on the twelfth the great  
Remaining honour celebrate.  
Much gold he gave, and gems, and food,  
To all the Bráhman multitude,  
And goats whose hair was white and fine,  
And many a thousand head of kine:  
Slaves, men and damsels, he bestowed,  
And many a car and fair abode:  
Such gifts he gave the Bráhman race  
His father's obsequies to grace.  
Then when the morning's earliest ray  
Appeared upon the thirteenth day,  
Again the hero wept and sighed  
Distraught and sorrow-stupefied;  
Drew, sobbing in his anguish, near,  
The last remaining debt to clear,  
And at the bottom of the pyre,  
He thus bespake his royal sire:  
'O father, hast thou left me so,  
Deserted in my friendless woe,  
When he to whom the charge was given  
To keep me, to the wood is driven?  
Her only son is forced away  
Who was his helpless mother's stay:  

Ah, whither, father, art thou fled;  
Leaving the queen uncomforted?'  

He looked upon the pile where lay  
The bones half-burnt and ashes grey,  
And uttering a piteous moan,  
Gave way, by anguish overthrown.  
Then as his tears began to well,  
Prostrate to earth the hero fell;  
So from its seat the staff they drag,  
And cast to earth some glorious flag.  
The ministers approached again  
The prince whom rites had freed from stain:  
So when Yayáti fell, each seer,  
In pity for his fate, drew near.  
S'atrughna saw him lying low  
O'erwhelmed beneath the crush of woe,  
And as upon the king he thought,  
He fell upon the earth distraught.  
When to his loving memory came  
Those noble gifts, that kingly frame,  
He sorrowed, by his woe distressed,  
As one by frenzied rage possessed:  
'Ah me, this surging sea of woe  
Has drowned us with its overflow:  
The source is Manthará, dire and dark,  
Kaikeyí is the ravening shark:  
And the great boons the monarch gave  
Lend conquering might to every wave.  
Ah, whither wilt thou go, and leave  
Thy Bharat in his woe to grieve,  
Whom ever 'twas thy greatest joy  
To fondle as a tender boy?  
Didst thou not give with thoughtful care  
Our food, our drink, our robes to wear?  
Whose love will now for us provide,  
When thou, our king and sire, hast died?  
At such a time bereft, forlorn,  
Why is not earth in sunder torn,  
Missing her monarch's firm control,  
His love of right, his lofty soul?  
Ah me, for Ráma roams afar,  
My sire is where the Blessed are;  
How can I live deserted? I  
Will pass into the fire and die.  
Abandoned thus, I will not brook  
Upon Ayodhyá's town to look,  
Once guarded by Ikshváku's race:  
The wood shall be my dwelling place.'  

Then when the princes' mournful train  
Heard the sad brothers thus complain,  
And saw their misery, at the view  
Their grief burst wilder out anew.  
Faint with lamenting, sad and worn,  
Each like a bull with broken horn,  
The brothers in their wild despair  
Lay rolling, mad with misery, there.  
Then old Vas'ishtha good and true,  
Their father's priest, all lore who knew,  
Raised weeping Bharat on his feet,  
And thus bespake with counsel meet:  
'Twelve days, my lord, have past away  

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>  

Since flames consumed thy father's clay:  
Delay no more: as rules ordain,  
Gather what bones may yet remain.  
Three constant pairs are ever found  
To hem all mortal creatures round:  <span
id="fr_354"></span>[1](ry156.htm#fn_354.md)  
Then mourn not thus, O Prince, for none  
Their close companionship may shun.'  
   Sumantra bade S'atrughna rise,  
And soothed his soul with counsel wise,  
And skilled in truth, his hearer taught  
How all things are and come to naught,  
When rose each hero from the ground,  
A lion lord of men, renowned,  
He showed like Indra's flag, <span
id="fr_355"></span>[2](ry156.htm#fn_355.md) whereon  
Fierce rains have dashed and suns have shone.  
They wiped their red and weeping eyes,  
And gently made their sad replies:  
Then, urged to haste, the royal pair  
Performed the rites that claimed their care.
