<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXII: KHARA'S WRATH.</H3>
<P>
Roused by the taunting words she spoke,<BR>
The mighty Khara's wrath awoke,<BR>
And there, while giants girt him round,<BR>
In these fierce words an utterance found:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'I cannot, peerless one, contain<BR>
Mine anger at this high disdain,<BR>
Galling as salt when sprinkled o'er<BR>
The rawness of a bleeding sore.<BR>
R&aacute;ma in little count I hold,<BR>
Weak man whose days are quickly told.<BR>
The caitiff with his life to-day<BR>
For all his evil deeds shall pay.<BR>
Dry, sister, dry each needless tear,<BR>
Stint thy lament and banish fear,<BR>
For R&aacute;ma and his brother go<BR>
This day to Yama's realm below.<BR>
My warrior's axe shall stretch him slain,<BR>
Ere set of sun, upon the plain,<BR>
Then shall thy sated lips be red<BR>
With his warm blood in torrents shed.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As Khara's speech the demon heard,<BR>
With sudden joy her heart was stirred:<BR>
She fondly praised him as the boast<BR>
And glory of the giant host.<BR>
First moved to ire by taunts and stings,<BR>
Now soothed by gentle flatterings,<BR>
To D&uacute;shan, who his armies led,<BR>
The demon Khara spoke, and said:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Friend, from the host of giants call<BR>
Full fourteen thousand, best of all,<BR>
Slaves of my will, of fearful might,<BR>
Who never turn their backs in fight:<BR>
Fiends who rejoice to slay and mar,<BR>
Dark as the clouds of autumn are:<BR>
Make ready quickly, O my friend,<BR>
My chariot and the bows I bend.<BR>
My swords, my shafts of brilliant sheen,<BR>
My divers lances long and keen.<BR>
On to the battle will I lead<BR>
These heroes of Pulastya's seed,<BR>
And thus, O famed for warlike skill,<BR>
R&aacute;ma my wicked foeman kill.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke, and ere his speech was done,<BR>
His chariot glittering like the sun,<BR>
Yoked and announced, by D&uacute;shan's care,<BR>
With dappled steeds was ready there.<BR>
High as a peak from Meru rent<BR>
It burned with golden ornament:<BR>
The pole of lazulite, of gold<BR>
Were the bright wheels whereon it rolled.<BR>
With gold and moonstone blazoned o'er,<BR>
Fish, flowers, trees, rocks, the panels bore;<BR>
Auspicious birds embossed thereon,<BR>
And stars in costly emblem shone.<BR>
O'er flashing swords his banner hung,<BR>
And sweet bells, ever tinkling, swung.<BR>

That mighty host with sword and shield<BR>
And oar was ready for the field:<BR>
And Khara saw, and D&uacute;shan cried,<BR>
'Forth to the fight, ye giants, ride."<BR>
Then banners waved, and shield and sword<BR>
Flashed as the host obeyed its lord.<BR>
From Janasth&aacute;n they sallied out<BR>
With eager speed, and din, and shout,<BR>
Armed with the mace for close attacks,<BR>
The bill, the spear, the battle-axe,<BR>
Steel quoit and club that flashed afar,<BR>
Huge bow and sword and scymitar,<BR>
The dart to pierce, the bolt to strike,<BR>
The murderous bludgeon, lance, and pike.<BR>
So forth from Janasth&aacute;n, intent<BR>
On Khara's will, the monsters went.<BR>
He saw their awful march: not far<BR>
Behind the host he drove his car.<BR>
Ware of his master's will, to speed<BR>
The driver urged each gold-decked steed.<BR>
Then forth the warrior's coursers sprang,<BR>
And with tumultuous murmur rang<BR>
Each distant quarter of the sky<BR>
And realms that intermediate lie.<BR>
High and more high within his breast<BR>
His pride triumphant rose,<BR>
While terrible as Death he pressed<BR>
Onward to slay his foes,<BR>
'More swiftly yet,' as on they fled,<BR>
He cried in thundering tones<BR>
Loud as a cloud that overhead<BR>
Hails down a flood of stones.<BR>
