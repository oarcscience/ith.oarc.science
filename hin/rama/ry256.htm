<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LVIII.: THE BROTHERS' MEETING.</H3>
<P>
When R&aacute;ma's deadly shaft had struck<BR>
The giant in the seeming buck.<BR>
The chieftain turned him from the place<BR>
His homeward way again to trace.<BR>
Then as he hastened onward, fain<BR>
To look upon his spouse again,<BR>
Behind him from a thicket nigh<BR>
Rang out a jackal's piercing cry.<BR>
Alarmed he heard the startling shriek<BR>
That raised his hair and dimmed his cheek,<BR>
And all his heart was filled with doubt<BR>
As the shrill jackal's cry rung out:<BR>
'Alas, some dire disaster seems<BR>
Portended by the jackal's screams.<BR>
O may the Maitil dame be screened<BR>
From outrage of each hungry fiend!<BR>

<P>
Alas, if Lakshman chanced to hear<BR>
That bitter cry of woe and fear<BR>
What time M&aacute;r&iacute;cha, as he died,<BR>
With voice that mocked my accents cried,<BR>
Swift to my side the prince would flee<BR>
And quit the dame to succour me.<BR>
Too well I see the demon band<BR>
The slaughter of my love have planned.<BR>
Me far from home and S&iacute;t&aacute;'s view<BR>
The seeming deer M&aacute;r&iacute;cha drew.<BR>
He led me far through brake and dell<BR>
Till wounded by my shaft he fell,<BR>
And as he sank rang out his cry,<BR>
'O save me, Lakshman, or I die.'<BR>
May it be well with both who stayed<BR>
In the great wood with none to aid,<BR>
For every fiend is now my foe<BR>
For Janasth&aacute;n's great overthrow,<BR>
And many an omen seen to-day<BR>
Has filled my heart with sore dismay.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Such were the thoughts and sad surmise<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma at the jackal's cries,<BR>
And all his heart within him burned<BR>
As to his cot his steps he turned.<BR>
He pondered on the deer that led<BR>
His feet to follow where it fled,<BR>
And sad with many a bitter thought<BR>
His home in Janasth&aacute;n he sought.<BR>
His soul was dark with woe and fear<BR>
When flocks of birds and troops of deer<BR>
Move round him from the left, and raised<BR>
Discordant voices as they gazed.<BR>
The omens which the chieftain viewed<BR>
The terror of his soul renewed,<BR>
When lo, to meet him Lakshman sped<BR>
With brows whence all the light had fled.<BR>
Near and more near the princes came,<BR>
Each brother's heart and look the same;<BR>
Alike on each sad visage lay<BR>
The signs of misery and dismay,<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma by his terror moved<BR>
His brother for his fault reproved<BR>
In leaving S&iacute;t&aacute; far from aid<BR>
In the wild wood where giants strayed.<BR>
Lakshman's left hand be took, and then<BR>
In gentle tones the prince of men,<BR>
Though sharp and fierce their tenour ran,<BR>
Thus to his brother chief began:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'O Lakshman, thou art much to blame<BR>
Leaving alone the Ma&iacute;thil dame,<BR>
And flying hither to my side:<BR>
O, may no ill my spouse betide!<BR>
But ah. I know my wife is dead,<BR>
And giants on her limbs have fed,<BR>
So strange, so terrible are all<BR>
The omens which my heart appal.<BR>
O Lakshman, may we yet return<BR>
The safety of my love to learn.<BR>
To find the child of Janak still<BR>
Alive and free from scathe and ill!<BR>
Each bird with notes of warning screams,<BR>

<P>
Though the hot sun still darts his beams.<BR>
The moan of deer, the jackal's yell<BR>
Of some o'erwhelming misery tell.<BR>
O mighty brother, still may she.<BR>
My princess, live from danger free!<BR>
That semblance of a golden deer<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Allured me far away,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  I followed nearer and more near,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And longed to take the prey.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  I followed where the quarry fled:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    My deadly arrow flew,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And as the dying creature bled,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The giant met my view.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Great tear and pain oppress my heart<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That dreads the coming blow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And through my left eye keenly dart<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The throbs that herald woe.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ah Lakshman, all these signs dismay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    My soul that sinks, with dread,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  I know my love is torn away,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Or, haply, she is dead.'<BR>
