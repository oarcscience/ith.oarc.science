### CANTO XXI.: VIS'VÁMITRA'S SPEECH.

The hermit heard with high content  
That speech so wondrous eloquent,  
And while each hair with joy arose, <span

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>  

He thus made answer at the close:  
'Good is thy speech O noble King,  
And like thyself in everything.  
So should their lips be wisdom-fraught  
Whom kings begot, Vas'ishtha taught.  
The favour which I came to seek  
Thou grantest ere my tongue can speak.  
But let my tale attention claim,  
And hear the need for which I came,  
O King, as Scripture texts allow,  
A holy rite employs me now.  
Two fiends who change their forms at will  
Impede that rite with cursed skill. <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_142)  
Oft when the task is nigh complete,  
These worst of fiends my toil defeat,  
Throw bits of bleeding flesh, and o'er  
The altar shed a stream of gore.  
When thus the rite is mocked and stayed,  
And all my pious hopes delayed,  
Cast down in heart the spot I leave,  
And spent with fruitless labour grieve.  
Nor can I, checked by prudence, dare  
Let loose my fury on them there:  
The muttered curse, the threatening word,  
In such a rite must ne'er be heard.  
Thy grace the rite from check can free.  
And yield the fruit I long to see.  
Thy duty bids thee, King, defend  
The suffering guest, the suppliant friend.  
Give me thy son, thine eldest born,  
Whom locks like raven's wings adorn,  
That hero youth, the truly brave,  
Of thee, O glorious King, I crave,  
For he can lay those demons low  
Who mar my rites and work me woe:  
My power shall shield the youth from harm,  
And heavenly might shall nerve his arm.  
And on my champion will I shower  
Unnumbered gifts of varied power,  
Such gifts as shall ensure his fame  
And spread through all the worlds his name.  
Be sure those fiends can never stand  
Before the might of Ráma's hand,  
And mid the best and bravest none  
Can slay that pair but Raghu's son.  
Entangled in the toils of Fate  
Those sinners, proud and obstinate,  
Are, in their fury overbold,  
No match for Ráma mighty-souled.  
Nor let a father's breast give way  
Too far to fond affection's sway.  
Count thou the fiends already slain:  
My word is pledged, nor pledged in vain.  
I know the hero Ráma well  

In whom high thoughts and valour dwell;  
So does Vas'ishtha, so do these  
Engaged in long austerities.  
If thou would do the righteous deed,  
And win high fame, thy virtue's meed,  
Fame that on earth shall last and live,  
To me. great King, thy Ráma give.  
If to the words that I have said,  
With Saint Vas'ishtha at their head  
Thy holy men, O King, agree,  
Then let thy Ráma go with me.  
Ten nights my sacrifice will last,  
And ere the stated time be past  
Those wicked fiends, those impious twain,  
Must fall by wondrous Ráma slain.  
Let not the hours, I warn thee, fly,  
Fixt for the rite, unheeded by;  
Good luck have thou, O royal Chief,  
Nor give thy heart to needless grief."  

Thus in fair words with virtue fraught  
The pious glorious saint besought.  
But the good speech with poignant sting  
Pierced ear and bosom of the king,  
Who, stabbed with pangs too sharp to bear,  
Fell prostrate and lay fainting there.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_140"></span>[33:1b](ry022.htm#fr_140) The Indian nectar or
drink of the Gods.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[33:2b](ry023.htm#fr_141) Great joy, according
to the Hindu belief, has this effect, not causing each particular hair
to stand on end, but gently raising all the down upon the body.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[34:1](ry023.htm#fr_142) The Rákshasas, giants,
or fiends who are represented as disturbing the sacrifice, signify here,
as often elsewhere, merely the savage tribes which placed themselves in
hostile opposition to Bráhmanical institutions.
