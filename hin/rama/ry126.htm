<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLVIII.: THE WOMEN'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
When those who forth with R&aacute;ma went<BR>
Back to the town their steps had bent,<BR>
It seemed that death had touched and chilled<BR>
Those hearts which piercing sorrow filled.<BR>
Each to his several mansion came,<BR>
And girt by children and his dame,<BR>
From his sad eyes the water shed<BR>
That o'er his cheek in torrents spread.<BR>
All joy was fled: oppressed with cares<BR>
No bustling trader showed his wares.<BR>
Each shop had lost its brilliant look,<BR>
Each householder forbore to cook.<BR>
No hand with joy its earnings told,<BR>
None cared to win a wealth of gold,<BR>
And scarce the youthful mother smiled<BR>
To see her first, her new-born child.<BR>
In every house a woman wailed,<BR>
And her returning lord assailed<BR>
With keen taunt piercing like the steel<BR>
That bids the tusked monster kneel;<BR>
'What now to them is wedded dame,<BR>
What house and home and dearest aim,<BR>
Or son, or bliss, or gathered store,<BR>
Whose eyes on R&aacute;ma look no more!<BR>
There is but one in all the earth,<BR>
One man alone of real worth,<BR>
Lakshman, who follows, true and good,<BR>
R&aacute;ma, with S&iacute;t&aacute;, through the wood,<BR>
Made holy for all time we deem<BR>
Each pool and fountain, lake and stream,<BR>
If great Kakutstha's son shall choose<BR>
Their water for his bath to use.<BR>
Each forest, dark with lovely trees,<BR>
Shall yearn Kakutstha's son to please;<BR>
Each mountain peak and woody hill,<BR>
Each mighty flood and mazy rill,<BR>
Each rocky height, each shady grove<BR>
Where the blest feet of R&aacute;ma rove,<BR>
Shall gladly welcome with the best<BR>
Of all they have their honoured guest.<BR>
The trees that clustering blossoms bear,<BR>
And bright-hued buds to gem their hair,<BR>
The heart of R&aacute;ma shall delight,<BR>
And cheer him on the breezy height.<BR>
For him the upland slopes will show<BR>
The fairest roots and fruit that grow,<BR>
And all their wealth before him fling<BR>
Ere the due hour of ripening.<BR>
For him each earth-upholding hill<BR>
Its crystal water shall distil,<BR>
And all its floods shall be displayed<BR>
In many a thousand-hued cascade.<BR>
Where R&aacute;ma stands is naught to fear,<BR>
No danger comes if he be near;<BR>
For all who live on him depend,<BR>
The world's support, and lord, and friend.<BR>
Ere in too distant wilds he stray,<BR>
Let us to R&aacute;ma speed away,<BR>
For rich reward on those will wait<BR>
Who serve a prince of soul so great.<BR>
We will attend on S&iacute;t&aacute; there;<BR>
Be Raghu's son your special care.'<BR>
The city dames, with grief distressed,<BR>
Thus once again their lords addressed:<BR>
'R&aacute;ma shall be your guard and guide,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute; will for us provide.<BR>
For who would care to linger here,<BR>
Where all is sad and dark and drear?<BR>
Who, mid the mourners, hope for bliss<BR>
ln a poor soulless town like this?<BR>
If Queen Kaikey&iacute;'s treacherous sin,<BR>
Our lord expelled, the kingdom win,<BR>
We heed not sons or golden store,<BR>
Our life itself we prize no more.<BR>
If she, seduced by lust of sway,<BR>
Her lord and son could cast away,<BR>
Whom would she leave unharmed, the base<BR>
Defiler of her royal race?<BR>
We swear it by our children dear,<BR>
We will not dwell as servants here;<BR>
If Queen Kaikey&iacute; live to reign,<BR>
We will not in her realm remain.<BR>
Bowed down by her oppressive hand,<BR>
The helpless, lordless, godless land,<BR>
Cursed for Kaikey&iacute;'s guilt will fall,<BR>
And swift destruction seize it all.<BR>

<P>
For, R&aacute;ma forced from home to fly,<BR>
The king his sire will surely die,<BR>
And when the king has breathed his last<BR>
Ruin will doubtless follow fast.<BR>
Sad, robbed of merits, drug the cup<BR>
And drink the poisoned mixture up,<BR>
Or share the exiled R&aacute;ma's lot,<BR>
Or seek some land that knows her not.<BR>
No reason, but a false pretence<BR>
Drove R&aacute;ma, Sit&aacute;, Lakshman hence,<BR>
And we to Bharat have been given<BR>
Like cattle to the shambles driven.<BR>

<P>
While in each house the women, pained<BR>
At loss of R&aacute;ma, still complained,<BR>
Sank to his rest the Lord of Day,<BR>
And night through all the sky held sway<BR>
The tires of worship all were cold,<BR>
No text was hummed, no tale was told,<BR>
And shades of midnight gloom came down<BR>
Eveloping the mournful town.<BR>
Still, sick at heart, the women shed,<BR>
As for a son or husband fled,<BR>
For R&aacute;ma tears, disquieted:<BR>

<P>
No child was loved as he.<BR>
And all Ayodhy&aacute;, where the feast,<BR>
Music, and song, and dance had ceased,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And merriment and glee,<BR>
Where every merchant's store was closed<BR>
That erst its glittering wares exposed,<BR>
Was like a dried up sea.<BR>
