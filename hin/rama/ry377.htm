<P>
'Thou bringest me,' she cried again,<BR>
'A mingled draught of bliss and pain<BR>
Bliss, that he wears me in his heart,<BR>
Pain, that he wakes and weeps apart,<BR>
O, see how Fate is king of all,<BR>
Now lifts us high, now bids us fall,<BR>
And leads a captive bound with cord<BR>
The meanest slave, the proudest lord,<BR>
Thus even now Fate's stern decree<BR>
Has struck with grief my lord and me.<BR>
Say, how shall R&aacute;ma reach the shore<BR>
Of sorrow's waves that rise and roar,<BR>
A shipwrecked sailor, wellnigh drowned<BR>
In the wild sea that foams around?<BR>
When will he smite the demon down,<BR>
Lay low in dust the giants' town,<BR>
And, glorious from his foes' defeat,<BR>
His wife, his long-lost S&iacute;t&aacute;, meet?<BR>
Go, bid him speed to smite his foes<BR>
Before the year shall reach its close.<BR>
Ten months are fled but two remain,<BR>
Then R&aacute;van's captive must be slain.<BR>
Oft has Vibh&iacute;shan, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_869"></A><A HREF="#fn_869"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> just and wise,<BR>
Besought him to restore his prize.<BR>
But deaf is R&aacute;van's senseless ear:<BR>
His brother's rede he will not hear.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan's daughter &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_870"></A><A HREF="#fn_870"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> loves me well:<BR>
From her I learnt the tale I tell,<BR>
Avindhva &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_871"></A><A HREF="#fn_871"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> prudent, just, and old,<BR>
The giant's fall has oft foretold;<BR>
But Fate impels him to despise<BR>
His word on whom he most relies.<BR>
In R&aacute;ma's love I rest secure,<BR>
For my fond heart is true and pure,<BR>
And him, my noblest lord, I deem<BR>
In valour, power, and might supreme.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As from her eyes the waters ran,<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chief again began:<BR>
'Yea, R&aacute;ma, when he hears my tale,.<BR>
Will with our hosts these walls assail,<BR>
Or I myself, O Queen, this day<BR>
Will bear thee from the fiend away,<BR>
Will lift thee up, and take thee hence<BR>
To him thy refuge and defence;<BR>
Will take thee in my arms, and flee;<BR>
To R&aacute;ma far beyond the sea;<BR>
Will place thee on Prasravan hill<BR>
Where Raghu's son is waiting still.'<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;  'How canst thou bear me hence?' she cried,<BR>
'The way is long, the sea is wide.<BR>
To bear my very weight would be<BR>
A task too hard for one like thee.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_872"></A><A HREF="ry378.htm#fn_872"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Swift rose before her startled eyes<BR>
The V&aacute;nar in his native size,<BR>
Like Mandar's hill or Meru's height,<BR>
Encircled with a blaze of light.<BR>
'O come,' he cried, 'thy fears dispel,<BR>
Nor doubt that I will bear thee well.<BR>
Come, in my strength and care confide,<BR>
And sit in joy by R&aacute;ma's side.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Again she spake: 'I know thee now,<BR>
Brave, resolute, and strong art thou;<BR>
In glory like the Lord of Fire<BR>
With storm-swift feet which naught may tire<BR>
But yet with thee I may not fly:<BR>
For, borne so swiftly through the sky,<BR>
Mine eyes would soon grow faint and dim,<BR>
My dizzy brain would reel and swim,<BR>
My yielding arms relax their hold,<BR>
And I in terror uncontrolled<BR>
Should fall into the raging sea<BR>
Where hungry sharks would feed on me.<BR>
Nor can I touch, of free accord,<BR>
The limbs of any save my lord.<BR>
If, by the giant forced away,<BR>
In his enfolding arms I lay,<BR>
Not mine, O V&aacute;nar, was the blame;<BR>
What could I do, a helpless dame?<BR>
Go, to my lord my message bear,<BR>
And bid him end my long despair.'<BR>
