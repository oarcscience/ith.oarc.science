<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CVI.: BHARAT'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
Good Bharat, by the river side,<BR>
To virtuous R&aacute;ma's speech replied,<BR>
And thus with varied lore addressed<BR>
The prince, while nobles round him pressed:<BR>
'In all this world whom e'er can we<BR>
Find equal, scourge of foes, to thee?<BR>
No ill upon thy bosom weighs.<BR>
No thoughts of joy thy spirit raise.<BR>
Approved art thou of sages old,<BR>
To whom thy doubts are ever told.<BR>
Alike in death and life, to thee<BR>
The same to be and not to be.<BR>
The man who such a soul can gain<BR>
Can ne'er be crushed by woe or pain.<BR>
Pure as the Gods, high-minded, wise,<BR>
Concealed from thee no secret lies.<BR>
Such glorious gifts are all thine own,<BR>
And birth and death to thee are known,<BR>
That ill can ne'er thy soul depress<BR>
With all-subduing bitterness.<BR>
O let my prayer, dear brother, win<BR>
Thy pardon for my mother's sin.<BR>
Wrought for my sake who willed it not<BR>
When absent in a distant spot.<BR>

<P>
Duty alone with binding chains<BR>
The vengeancs due to crime restrains,<BR>
Or on the sinner I should lift<BR>
My hand in retribution swift.<BR>
Can I who know the right, and spring<BR>
From Das'aratha, purest king--<BR>
Can I commit a heinous crime,<BR>
Abhorred by all through endless time?<BR>
The aged king I dare not blame,<BR>
Who died so rich in holy fame,<BR>
My honoured sire, my parted lord,<BR>
E'en as a present God adored.<BR>
Yet who in lore of duty skilled<BR>
So foul a crime has ever willed,<BR>
And dared defy both gain and right<BR>
To gratify a woman's spite?<BR>
When death draws near, so people say,<BR>
The sense af creatures dies away;<BR>
And he has proved the ancient saw<BR>
By acting thus in spite of law.<BR>
But O my honoured lord, be kind.<BR>
Dismiss the trespass from thy mind,<BR>
The sin the king committed, led<BR>
By haste, his consort's wrath, and dread.<BR>
For he who veils his sire's offence<BR>
With tender care and reverence--<BR>
His sons approved by all shall live:<BR>
Not so their fate who ne'er forgive.<BR>
Be thou, my lord, the noble son,<BR>
And the vile deed my sire has done,<BR>
Abhorred by all the virtuous, ne'er<BR>
Resent, lest thou the guilt too share.<BR>
Preserve us, for on thee we call.<BR>
Our sire, Kaikeyi, me and all<BR>
Thy citizens, thy kith and kin;<BR>
Preserve us and reverse the sin.<BR>
To live in woods a devotee<BR>
Can scarce with royal tasks agree,<BR>
Nor can the hermit's matted hair<BR>
Suit fitly with a ruler's care.<BR>
Do not, my brother, do not still<BR>
Pursue this life that suits thee ill.<BR>
Mid duties, of a king we count<BR>
His consecration paramount,<BR>
That he with ready heart and hand<BR>
May keep his people and his land.<BR>
What Warrior born to royal sway<BR>
From certain good would turn away,<BR>
A doubtful duty to pursue,<BR>
That mocks him with the distant view?<BR>
Thou wouldst to duty cleave, and gain<BR>
The meed that follows toil and pain.<BR>
In thy great task no labour spare:<BR>
Rule the four castes with justest care.<BR>
Mid all the four, the wise prefer<BR>
The order of the householder:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_383"></A><A HREF="#fn_383"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Canst thou, whose thoughts to duty cleave,<BR>
The best of all the orders leave?<BR>
My better thou in lore divine,<BR>
My birth, my sense must yield to thine:<BR>
While thou, my lord, art here to reign,<BR>
How shall my hands the rule maintain?<BR>
O faithful lover of the right,<BR>
Take with thy friends the royal might,<BR>
Let thy sires' realm, from trouble free,<BR>
Obey her rightful king in thee.<BR>
Here let the priests and lords of state<BR>
Our monatch duly consecrate,<BR>
With prayer and holy verses blessed<BR>
By saint Vas'ishtha and the rest.<BR>
Anointed king by us, again<BR>
Seek fair Ayodhv&aacute; there to reign,<BR>
And like imperial Indra girt<BR>
By Gods of Storm, thy might assert.<BR>
From the three debts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_384"></A><A HREF="#fn_384"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> acquittance earn,<BR>
And with thy wrath the wicked burn,<BR>
O'er all of us thy rule extend,<BR>
And cheer with boons each faithful friend.<BR>
Let thine enthronement, lord, this day<BR>
Make all thy lovers glad and gay,<BR>
And let all those who hate thee flee<BR>
To the ten winds for fear of thee.<BR>
Dear lord, my mother's words of hate<BR>
With thy sweet virtues expiate,<BR>
And from the stain of folly clear<BR>
The father whom we both revere.<BR>
Brother, to me compassion show,<BR>
I pray thee with my head bent low,<BR>
And to these friends who on thee call,--<BR>
As the Great Father pities all.<BR>
But if my tears and prayers be vain,<BR>
And thou in woods wilt still remain,<BR>
I will with thee my path pursue<BR>
And make my home in forests too.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Bharat strove to bend his will<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With suppliant head, but he,<BR>
Earth's lord, inexorable still<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Would keep his sire's decree.<BR>
The firmness of the noble chief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The wondering people moved,<BR>
And rapture mingling with their grief,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  All wept and all approved.<BR>
'How firm his steadfast will,' they cried,<BR>
&nbsp; 'Who Keeps his promise thus!<BR>
Ah, to Ayodhy&aacute;'s town,' they sighed,<BR>
&nbsp; 'He comes not back with us'<BR>
The holy priest, the swains who tilled<BR>
&nbsp; The earth, the sons of trade,<BR>
And e'en the mournful queens were filled<BR>
&nbsp; With joy as Bharat prayed,<BR>
And bent their heads, then weeping stilled<BR>
&nbsp; A while, his prayer to aid.<BR>
