<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLIX.: R&Aacute;MA'S LAMENT</H3>
<P>
Ranged round the spot where R&aacute;ma fell<BR>
Each V&aacute;nar chief stood sentinel.<BR>
At length the mighty hero broke<BR>
The trance that held him, and awoke.<BR>
He saw his senseless brother, dyed<BR>
With blood from head to foot, and cried:<BR>
'What have I now to do with life<BR>
Or rescue of my prisoned wife,<BR>
When thus before my weeping eyes,<BR>
Slain in the fight, my brother lies?<BR>
A queen like S&iacute;t&aacute; I may find<BR>
Among the best of womankind,<BR>
But never such a brother, tried<BR>
In war, my guardian, friend, and guide.<BR>
If he be dead, the brave and true,<BR>
I will not live but perish too.<BR>
How, reft of Lakshman, shall I meet<BR>
My mother, and Kaikey&iacute; greet?<BR>
Mv brother's eager question brook,<BR>
And fond Sumitr&aacute;'s longing look?<BR>
What shall I say, o'erwhelmed with shame<BR>
To cheer the miserable dame?<BR>
How, when she hears her son is dead,<BR>
Will her sad heart be comforted?<BR>
Ah me, for longer life unfit<BR>
This mortal body will I quit;<BR>
For Lakshman slaughtered for my sake,<BR>
From sleep of death will never wake.<BR>
Ah when I sank oppressed with care,<BR>
Thy gentle voice could soothe despair.<BR>
And art thou, O my brother, killed?<BR>
Is that dear voice for ever stilled?<BR>
Cold are those lips, my brother, whence<BR>
Came never word to breed offence?<BR>
Ah stretched upon the gory plain<BR>
My brother lies untimely slain;<BR>
Numbed is the mighty arm that slew<BR>
The leaders of the giant crew.<BR>
Transfixed with shafts, with blood-streams red.<BR>
Thou liest on thy lowly bed:<BR>

<P>
So sinks to rest, his journey done,<BR>
Mid arrowy rays the crimson sun.<BR>
Thou, when from home and sire I fled,<BR>
The wood's wild ways with me wouldst tread:<BR>
Now close to thine my steps shall be,<BR>
For I in death will follow thee.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan now will curse my name,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma as a braggart blame.<BR>
Who promised--but his word is vain--<BR>
That he in Lank&aacute;'s isle should reign.<BR>
Return, Sugr&iacute;va: reft of me<BR>
Lead back thy V&aacute;nars o'er the sea,<BR>
Nor hope to battle face to face<BR>
With him who rules the giant race.<BR>
Well have ye done and nobly fought,<BR>
And death in desperate combat sought.<BR>
All that heroic might can do,<BR>
Brave V&aacute;nars, has been done by you.<BR>
My faithful friends I now dismiss:<BR>
Return: my last farewell is this.'<BR>

<P>
Bedewed with tears was every cheek<BR>
As thus the V&aacute;nars heard him speak.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan on the field had stayed<BR>
The V&aacute;nar hosts who fled dismayed.<BR>
Now lifting up his mace on high<BR>
With martial step the chief drew nigh.<BR>
The hosts who watched by R&aacute;ma's side<BR>
Beheld his shape and giant stride.<BR>
'Tis he,'tis R&aacute;van's son, they thought:<BR>
And all in flight their safety sought.<BR>
