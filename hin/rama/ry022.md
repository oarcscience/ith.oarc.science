### CANTO XX.: VIS'VÁMITRA'S VISIT.

Now Das'aratha's pious mind  
Meet wedlock for his sons designed;  

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>  

With priests and friends the king began  
To counsel and prepare his plan.  
Such thoughts engaged his bosom, when,  
To see Ayodhyá's lord of men,  
A mighty saint of glorious fame,  
The hermit Vis'vámitra  <span id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_137.md) came.  
For evil fiends that roam by night  
Disturbed him in each holy rite.  
And in their strength and frantic rage  
Assailed with witcheries the sage.  
He came to seek the monarch's aid  
To guard the rites the demons stayed,  
Unable to a close to bring  
One unpolluted offering.  
Seeking the king in this dire strait  
He said to those who kept the gate:  
'Haste, warders, to your master run,  
And say that here stands Gádhi's son.'  

Soon as they heard the holy man,  
To the king's chamber swift they ran  
With minds disordered all, and spurred  
To wildest zeal by what they heard.  
On to the royal hall they sped,  
There stood and lowly bowed the head,  
And made the lord of men aware  
That the great saint was waiting there.  
   The king with priest and peer arose  
     And ran the sage to meet,  
   As Indra from his palace goes  
     Lord Brahmá's self to greet.  
When glowing with celestial light  
The pious hermit was in sight,  
The king, whose mien his transport showed,  
The honoured gift for guests bestowed.  
Nor did the saint that gift despise,  
Offered as holy texts advise;  
He kindly asked the earth's great king  
How all with him was prospering.  
The son of Kus'ik  <span id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_138.md) bade him tell  
If all in town and field were well,  
All well with friends, and kith and kin,  
And royal treasure stored within:  
   'Do all thy neighbours own thy sway?  
     Thy foes confess thee yet?  
   Dost thou continue still to pay  
     To Gods and men each debt?'  
Then he of hermits first and best,  
Vas'ishtha with a smile  <span id="fr_139"></span>[3](#fn_139.md)
addressed,  

And asked him of his welfare too,  
Showing him honour as was due.  
Then with the sainted hermit all  
Went joyous to the monarch's hall,  
And sate them down by due degree,  
Each one, of rank and dignity.  
Joy filled the noble prince's breast  
Who thus bespoke the honoured guest:  
'As amrit  <span id="fr_140"></span>[1b](ry023.htm#fn_140.md) by a mortal
found,  
As rain upon the thirsty ground,  
As to an heirless man a son  
Born to him of his precious one,  
As gain of what we sorely miss,  
As sudden dawn of mighty bliss,  
So is thy coming here to me:  
All welcome, mighty Saint, to thee.  
What wish within thy heart hast thou?  
If I can please thee, tell me how.  
Hail, Saint, from whom all honours flow,  
Worthy of all I can bestow.  
Blest is my birth with fruit to-day,  
Nor has my life been thrown away.  
I see the best of Bráhman race  
And night to glorious morn gives place.  
Thou, holy Sage, in days of old  
Among the royal saints enrolled,  
Didst, penance glorified, within  
The Bráhman caste high station win.  
'Tis meet and right in many a way  
That I to thee should honour pay.  
This seems a marvel to mine eyes:  
All sin thy visit purifies;  
And I by seeing thee, O Sage,  
Have reaped the fruit of pilgrimage.  
Then say what thou wouldst have me do,  
That thou hast sought this interview.  
Favoured by thee, my wish is still,  
O Hermit, to perform thy will.  
Nor needest thou at length explain  
The object that thy heart would gain.  
Without reserve I grant it now:  
My deity, O Lord, art thou.'  

The glorious hermit, far renowned,  
With highest fame and virtue crowned,  
Rejoiced these modest words to hear  
Delightful to the mind and ear.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_136"></span>[32:1b](ry021.htm#fr_136.md) Schlegel. in the
*Indische Bibliothek*, remarks that the proficiency of the Indians in
this art early attracted the attention of Alexander's successors, and
natives of India were so long exclusively employed in this service that
the name Indian was applied to any elephant-driver, to whatever country
be might belong.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[33:1](ry022.htm#fr_137.md) The story of this
famous saint is given at sufficient length in Cantos LI-LV.

This saint has given his name to the district and city to the east of
Benares. The original name, preserved in a land- grant on copper now in
the Museum of the Benares College, has been Moslemized into Ghazeepore
(the City of the Soldier- martyr).

<span id="fn_138"></span>[33:2](ry022.htm#fr_138.md) The son of Kus'ik is
Vis'vámitra.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[33:3](ry022.htm#fr_139.md) At the recollection of
their former enmity, to be described hereafter.
