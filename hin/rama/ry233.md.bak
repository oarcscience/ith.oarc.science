### CANTO XXXV.: RÁVAN'S JOURNEY.

When Rávan, by her fury spurred,  
That terrible advice had heard,  
He bade his nobles quit his side,  
And to the work his thought applied.  
He turned his anxious mind to scan  
On every side the hardy plan:  
The gain against the risk he laid,  
Each hope and fear with care surveyed,  
And in his heart at length decreed  
To try performance of the deed.  
Then steady in his dire intent  
The giant to the courtyard went.  
There to his charioteer he cried,  
'Bring forth the car whereon I ride.'  
Aye ready at his master's word  
The charioteer the order heard.  
And yoked with active zeal the best  
Of chariots at his lord's behest.  
Asses with heads of goblins drew  
That wondrous car where'er it flew.  
Obedient to the will it rolled  
Adorned with gems and glistering gold.  
Then mounting, with a roar as loud  
As thunder from a labouring cloud,  
The mighty monarch to the tide  
Of Ocean, lord of rivers, hied.  
White was the shade above him spread,  
White chouris waved around his head,  
And he with gold and jewels bright  
Shone like the glossy lazulite.  
Ten necks and twenty arms had he:  
His royal gear was good to see.  
The heavenly Gods' insatiate foe.  
Who made the blood of hermits flow,  
He like the Lord of Hills appeared  
With ten huge heads to heaven upreared.  
In the great car whereon he rode,  
Like some dark cloud the giant showed,  
When round it in their close array  
The cranes 'mid wreaths of lightning play.  
He looked, and saw, from realms of air,  
The rocky shore of ocean, where  
Unnumbered trees delightful grew  
With flower and fiuit of every hue.  
He looked on many a lilied pool  
With silvery waters fresh and cool,  
And shores like spacious altars meet  
For holy hermits' lone retreat,  
The graceful palm adorned the scene,  
The plantain waved her glossy green,  
Where grew the sál and betel, there  
On bending boughs the flowers were fair.  
There hermits dwelt who tamed each sense  
By strictest rule of abstinence:  
Gandharvas, Kinnars, <span id="fr_489"></span>[1](#fn_489.md) thronged the
place,  
Nágas and birds of heavenly race.  
Bright minstrels of the ethereal quire,  
And saints exempt from low desire,  
With Ájas, sons of Brahmá's line,  
Maríchipas of seed divine,  
Vaikhánasas and Máshas strayed,  
And Bálakhilyas <span id="fr_490"></span>[2](#fn_490.md) in the shade.  
The lovely nymphs of heaven were there,  
Celestial wreaths confined their hair,  
And to each form new grace was lent  
By wealth of heavenly ornament.  
Well skilled was each in play and dance  
And gentle arts of dalliance.  
The glorious wife of many a God  
Those beautiful recesses trod,  
There Gods and Dánavs, all who eat  
The food of heaven, rejoiced to meet.  
The swan and Sáras thronged each bay  
With curlews, ducks, and divers gay,  
Where the sea spray rose soft and white  
O'er rocks of glossy lazulite.  
As his swift way the fiend pursued  
Pale chariots of the Gods he viewed,  
Bearing each lord whose rites austere  
Had raised him to the heavenly sphere.  
Thereon celestial garlands hung,  
There music played and songs were sung.  
Then bright Gandharvas met his view,  
And heavenly nymphs, as on he flew.  
He saw the sandal woods below,  
And precious trees of odorous flow,  
That to the air around them lent  
Their riches of delightful scent;  
Nor failed his roving eye to mark  
Tall aloe trees in grove and park.  
He looked on wood with cassias filled,  
And plants which balmy sweets distilled,  
Where her fair flowers the betel showed  
And the bright pods of pepper glowed.  
The pearls in many a silvery heap  
Lay on the margin of the deep.  
And grey rocks rose amid the red  
Of coral washed from ocean's bed.  

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>  

High soared the mountain peaks that bore  
Treasures of gold and silver ore,  
And leaping down the rocky walls  
Came wild and glorious waterfalls.  
Fair towns which grain and treasure held,  
And dames who every gem excelled,  
He saw outspread beneath him far,  
With steed, and elephant, and car.  
That ocean shore he viewed that showed  
Fair as the blessed Gods' abode  
Where cool delightful breezes played  
O'er levels in the freshest shade.  
He saw a fig-tree like a cloud  
With mighty branches earthward bowed.  
It stretched a hundred leagues and made  
For hermit bands a welcome shade.  
Thither the feathered king of yore  
An elephant and tortoise bore,  
And lighted on a bough to eat  
The captives of his taloned feet.  
The bough unable to sustain  
The crushing weight and sudden strain,  
Loaded with sprays and leaves of spring  
Gave way beneath the feathered king.  
Under the shadow of the tree  
Dwelt man, a saint and devotee,  
Ájas, the sons of Brahmá's line,  
Máshas Maríchipas divine.  
Vaikhánasas, and all the race  
Of Bálakhilyas loved the place.  
But pitying their sad estate  
The feathered monarch raised the weight  
Of the huge bough, and bore away  
The loosened load and captured prey.  
A hundred leagues away he sped,  
Then on his monstrous booty fed,  
And with the bough he smote the lands  
Where dwell the wild Nisháda bands.  
High joy was his because his deed  
From jeopardy the hermits freed.  
That pride for great deliverance wrought  
A double share of valour brought.  
His soul conceived the high emprise  
To snatch the Amrit from the skies.  
He rent the nets of iron first,  
Then through the jewel chamber burst,  
And bore the drink of heaven away  
That watched in Indra's palace lay.  

Such was the hermit-sheltering tree  
Which Rávan turned his eye to see.  
Still marked where Garud sought to rest,  
The fig-tree bore the name of Blest.  

When Rávan stayed his chariot o'er  
The ocean's heart-enchanting shore,  
He saw a hermitage that stood  
Sequestered in the holy wood.  
He saw the fiend Marícha there  
With deerskin garb, and matted hair  
Coiled up in hermit guise, who spent  
His days by rule most abstinent.  
As guest and host are wont to meet,  

They met within that lone retreat.  
Before the king Márícha placed  
Food never known to human taste.  
He entertained his guest with meat  
And gave him water for his feet,  
And then addressed the giant king  
With timely words of questioning:  

'Lord, is "it well with thee, and well  
With those in Lanká's town who dwell?  
What sudden thought, what urgent need  
Has brought thee with impetuous speed?  

The fiend Márícha thus addressed  
Rávan the king, his mighty guest,  
And he, well skilled in arts that guide  
The eloquent, in turn replied:
