<P>
No flash of lightning lit the sky.<BR>
No cloudlet marred the blue on high.<BR>
The Saras &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_631"></A><A HREF="#fn_631"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> missed the welcome rain,<BR>
The moon's full beams were bright again.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, lapped in bliss, forgot<BR>
The claims of faith, or heeded not;<BR>
And by alluring joys misled<BR>
The path of falsehood learned to tread<BR>
In careless ease he passed each hour,<BR>
And dallied in his lady's bower<BR>
Each longing of his heart was stilled,<BR>
And every lofty hope fulfilled.<BR>
With royal Rum&aacute; by his side,<BR>
Or Tar&aacute; yet a dearer bride,<BR>

He spent each joyous day and night<BR>
In revelry and wild delight,<BR>
Like Indra whom the nymphs entice<BR>
To taste the joys of Paradise.<BR>
The power to courtiers' hands resigned,<BR>
To all their acts his eyes were blind.<BR>
All doubt, all fear he cast aside<BR>
And lived with pleasure for his guide.<BR>
But sage Hanum&aacute;n, firm and true,<BR>
Whose heart the lore of Scripture knew,<BR>
Well trained to meet occasion, trained<BR>
In all by duty's law ordained,<BR>
Strove with his prudent speech to find<BR>
*Set* access to the monarch's mind.<BR>
He, skilled in every gentle art<BR>
Of eloquence that wins the heart,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va from his trance to wake,<BR>
His salutary counsel spake:<BR>
&nbsp; 'The realm is won, thy name advanced,<BR>
The glory of thy house enhanced,<BR>
And now thy foremost care should he<BR>
To aid the friends who succoured thee.<BR>
He who is firm and faithful found<BR>
To friendly ties in honour bound,<BR>
Will see his name and fame increase<BR>
Wide sway is his who truly boasts<BR>
That friends and treasure, self and hosts,<BR>
Are blest in one harmonious whole,<BR>
Are subject to his firm control.<BR>
Do thou, whose footsteps never stray<BR>
From the clear bounds of duty's way.<BR>
Assist, as honour bids thee, now<BR>
Thy friends, observant of thy vow.<BR>
For if all cares we lay not by.<BR>
And to our friend's assistance fly.<BR>
We, after, toil in idle haste,<BR>
And all the late endeavour waste.<BR>
Up! nor the promised help delay<BR>
Until the hour have slipped away.<BR>
Up! and with Raghu's son renew<BR>
The search for Sit&aacute; lost to view.<BR>
The hour is come: he hears the call,<BR>
But not on thee reproaches fall<BR>
From him who labours to repress<BR>
His eager spirit's restlessness.<BR>
Long joined to thee in friendly ties<BR>
He made thy fame and fortune rise,<BR>
In gentle gifts by none excelled.<BR>
In splendid might unparalleled.<BR>
Up, to his succour, King! repay<BR>
The favour of that prosperous day,<BR>
And to thy bravest captains send<BR>
Prompt mandates to assist thy friend,<BR>
Tbe cry for help thou wilt not spurn<BR>
Although no grace demands return:<BR>
And wilt thou not thine aid afford<BR>
To him who realm and life restored?<BR>
Exert thy power, and thou hast won<BR>
The love of Dasaratha's son:<BR>
And will then for his summons wait,<BR>
And till he call thee, hesitate?<BR>
Think not the hero needs thy power<BR>
To save him in the desperate hour:<BR>
He with his arrows could subdue<BR>
The Gods and all the demon crew,<BR>
And only waits that he may see<BR>
Redeemed the promise made by thee.<BR>
For thee he risked his life and fought,<BR>
For thee that great deliverance wrought.<BR>
Then let us trace through earth and skies<BR>
His lady wheresoe'er she lies.<BR>
Through realms above, beneath, we flee,<BR>
And plant our footsteps on the sea.<BR>
Tnen why, O Lord of Vanary, still<BR>
Delay us waiting for thy will?<BR>
Give thy commands, O King, and say<BR>
What task has each and where the way.<BR>
Before thee myriad Vanars stand<BR>
To sweep through heaven, o'er seas and land.'<BR>
&nbsp; Sugriva heard the timely rede<BR>
That roused him in the day of need,<BR>
And thus to Nila prompt and brave<BR>
His hest the imperial Vanar gave:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Go, Nila, to the distant hosts<BR>
That keep in arms their several posts,<BR>
And all the armies that protect<BR>
The quarters, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_632"></A><A HREF="ry304.htm#fn_632"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with their chiefs, collect.<BR>
To all the luminaries placed<BR>
In intermediate regions haste,<BR>
And bid each captain rise and lead<BR>
His squadrons to their king with speed<BR>
Do thou meanwhile with strictest care<BR>
All that the time requires prepare.<BR>
The loitering Vanar who delays<BR>
To gather here ere thrice five days,<BR>
Shall surely die for his offence,<BR>
Condemned for sinful negligence.'<BR>
