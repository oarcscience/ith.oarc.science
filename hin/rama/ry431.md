### CANTO XXXII.: SITÁ'S LAMENT.

Again her eyes with tears o'erflowed.  
She gazed upon the head he showed.  
Gazed on the bow so famed of yore,  
The glorious bow which Ráma bore.  
She gazed upon his cheek and brows,  
The eyes of her beloved spouse;  
His lips, the lustre of his hair,  
The priceless gem that glittered there.  
The features of her Lord she knew,  
And, pierced with anguish at the view,  
She lifted up her voice and cried:  
  "Kaikey, are thou satisfied?'  
Now all thy longings are fulfilled;  
The joy of Rughu's race is killed,  
And ruined is the ancient line,  
Destroyer, by that hand of thine.  
Ah, what offense, O cruel dame,  
What fault in Ráma couldst thou blame,  
To drive him clad in hermit dress  
With Sitá to the wilderness?'  
  Great trembling seized her frame, and she  
Fell like a stricken plantain tree.  
As \*\*\*\* the \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* lays at length  
Slowly regaining sense and strength,  
On the dear head she \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* her eye

And cried with very bitter cry:  
'Ah, when thy cold dead cheek I view,  
My hero, I am murdered too.  
Then first a faithful woman's eyes  
See sorrow, when her husband dies.  
When thou, my lord, wast nigh to save,  
Some stealthy hand thy death wound gave.  
Thou art not dead: rise, hero, rise;  
Long life was thine, as spake the wise  
Whose words, I ween, are ever true,  
For faith lies open to their view.  
Ah lord, and shall thy head recline  
On earth's cold breast, forsaking mine,  
Counting her chill lap dearer far  
Than I and my caresses are?  
Ah, is it thus these eyes behold  
Thy famous bow adorned with gold,  
Whereon of yore I loved to bind  
Sweet garlands that my bands had twined?  
And hast thou sought in heaven a place  
Amid the founders of thy race,  
Where in the home deserved so well  
Thy sires and Das'aratha dwell?  
Or dost thou shine a brighter star  
In skies where blest immortals are,  
Forsaking in thy lofty scorn  
The race wherein thy sires were born?  
Turn to my gaze. O turn thine eye:  
Why are thy cold lips silent, why?  
When first we met as youth and maid.  
When in thy hand my hand was laid,  
Thy promise was thy steps should be  
Through life in duty's path with me.  
Remember, faithful still, thy vow,  
And take me with thee even now.  
Is that broad bosom where I hung,  
That neck to which I fondly clung,  
Where flowery garlands breathed their scent  
By hungry dogs and vultures rent?  
Shall no funereal honours grace  
The parted lord of Raghu's race,  
Whose bounty liberal fees bestowed.  
For whom the fires of worship glowed?  
Kaus'alyá wild with grief will see  
One sole survivor of the three  
Who in their hermit garments went  
To the dark woods in banishment.  
Then at her cry shall Lakshman tell  
How, slain by night, the Vánars fell;  
How to thy side the giants crept,  
And slew the hero as he slept.  
Thy fate and mine the queen will know,  
And broken-hearted die of woe.  
For my unworthy sake, for mine,  
Ráma, the glory of his line,  
Who bridged his way across the main,  
Is basely in a puddle slain;  
And I, the graceless wife he wed,  
Have brought this ruin on his head.  
Me, too, on him, O Rávan, slay:  

The wife beside her husband lay.  
By his dear body let me rest,  
Cheek close to cheek and breast to breast,  
My happy eyes I then will close.  
And follow whither Ráma goes.'  
   Thus cried the miserable dame;  
When to the king a warder came,  
Before the giant monarch bowed  
And said that, followed by a crowd  
Of counsellors and lords of state,  
Prahasta stood before the gate,  
And, sent by some engrossing care,  
Craved audience of his master there.  
The anxious tyrant left his seat  
And hastened forth the chief to meet:  
Then summoning his nobles all,  
Took counsel in his regal hall.  
   When Lanká's lord had left the queen,  
The head and bow no more were seen.  
The giant king his nobles eyed,  
And, terrible as Yama, cried:  
'O faithful lords, the time is come:  
Gather our hosts with beat of drum.  
Nigh to the town our foeman draws:  
Be prudent, nor reveal the cause.'  
   The nobles listened and obeyed:  
Swift were the gathered troops arrayed,  
And countless rovers of the night  
Stood burning for the hour of tight.
