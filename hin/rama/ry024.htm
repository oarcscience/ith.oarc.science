<P>
His tortured senses all astray,<BR>
Awhle the hapless monarch lay,<BR>
Then slowly gathering thought and strength<BR>
To Visv&aacute;mitra spoke at length:<BR>
'My son is but a child, I ween;<BR>
This year he will be just sixteen.<BR>
How is he fit for such emprise,<BR>
My darling with the lotus eyes?<BR>
A mghty army will I bring<BR>
That calls me master, lord, and king,<BR>
And with its countless squadrons fight<BR>
Against these rovers of the night.<BR>
Mv faithful heroes skilled to wield<BR>
The arms of war will take the field;<BR>
Their skill the demons' might may break:<BR>
R&aacute;ma, my child, thou must not take.<BR>
I, even I, my bow in hand,<BR>
Will in the van of battle stand,<BR>
And, while my soul is left alive,<BR>
With the night-roaming demons strive.<BR>
Thy guarded sacrifice shall be<BR>
Completed, from all hindrance free.<BR>
Thither will I my journey make:<BR>
R&aacute;ma, my child, thou must not take.<BR>
A boy unskilled, he knows not yet<BR>
The bounds to strength and weakness set,<BR>
No match is he for demon foes<BR>
Who magic arts to arms oppose.<BR>

<P>
O chief of saints, I have no power,<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma reft, to live one hour:<BR>
Mine aged heart at once would break:<BR>
R&aacute;ma, my child, thou must not take.<BR>
Nine thousand circling years have fled<BR>
With all their seasons o'er my head,<BR>
And as a hard-won boon, O sage,<BR>
These sons have come to cheer mine age.<BR>
My dearest love amid the four<BR>
Is he whom first his mother bore,<BR>
Still dearer for his virtues' sake:<BR>
R&aacute;ma, my child, thou must not take.<BR>
But if, unmoved by all I say,<BR>
Thou needs must bear my son away,<BR>
Let me lead with him, I entreat,<BR>
A four-fold army &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> all complete.<BR>
What is the demons' might, O Sage?<BR>
Who are they? What their parentage?<BR>
What is their size? What beings lend<BR>
Their power to guard them and befriend?<BR>
How can my son their arts withstand?<BR>
Or I or all my armed band?<BR>
Tell me the whole that I may know<BR>
To meet in war each evil foe<BR>
Whom conscious might inspires with pride.'<BR>

<P>
And Vis'v&aacute;mitra thus replied:<BR>
'Sprung from Pulastya's race there came<BR>
A giant known by R&aacute;van's name.<BR>
Once favoured by the Eternal Sire<BR>
He plagues the worlds in ceaseless ire,<BR>
For peerless power and might renowned,<BR>
By giant bands encompassed round.<BR>
Vis'ravas for his sire they hold,<BR>
His brother is the Lord of Gold.<BR>
King of the giant hosts is he,<BR>
And worst of all in cruelty.<BR>
This R&aacute;van's dread commands impel<BR>
Two demons who in might excel,<BR>
Maricha and Suv&aacute;hu hight,<BR>
To trouble and impede the rite.'<BR>

<P>
Then thus the king addressed the sage:<BR>
'No power have I, my lord, to wage<BR>
War with this evil-minded foe;<BR>
Now pity on my darling show,<BR>
And upon me of hapless fate,<BR>
For thee as God I venerate.<BR>
Gods, spirits, bards of heavenly birth, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
The birds of air, the snakes of earth<BR>
Before the might of R&aacute;van quail,<BR>
Much less, can mortal man avail.<BR>
He draws, I hear, from out the breast<BR>


<P>

<P>


<P>
The valour of the mightiest.<BR>
No, ne'er can I with him contend,<BR>
Or with the forces he may send.<BR>
How can I then my darling lend,<BR>
Godlike, unskilled in battle? No,<BR>
I will not let my young child go.<BR>
Foes of thy rite, those mighty ones,<BR>
Sunda and Upasunda's sons,<BR>
Are fierce as Fate to overthrow:<BR>
I will not let my young child go.<BR>
Maricha and Suv&aacute;hu fell<BR>
Are valiant and instructed well.<BR>
One of the twain I might attack.<BR>
With all my friends their lord to back.'<BR>
