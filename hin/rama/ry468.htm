<P>
The giants bent, in rage and grief,<BR>
Their eyes upon the fallen chief:<BR>
Then flying wild with fear and pale<BR>
To R&aacute;van bore the mournful tale.<BR>
He heard how Atik&aacute;ya died,<BR>
Then turned him to his lords, and cried:<BR>
'Where are they now--my bravest--where,<BR>
Wise to consult and prompt to dare?<BR>
Where is Dh&uacute;mr&aacute;ksha, skilled to wield<BR>
All weapons in the battle field?<BR>
Akampan, and Prahasta's might,<BR>
And Kumbhakarna hold in fight?<BR>
These, these and many a R&aacute;kshas more,<BR>
Each master of the arms he bore,<BR>

<P>
Who every foe in fight o'erthrew,<BR>
The victors none could e'er subdue,<BR>
Have perished by the might of one,<BR>
The vengeful arm of Raghu's son.<BR>
In vain I cast mine eyes around,<BR>
No match for R&aacute;ma here is found,<BR>
No chief to stand before that bow<BR>
Whose deadly shafts have caused our woe.<BR>
Now, warriors, to your stations hence;<BR>
Provide ye for the wall's defence,<BR>
And be the As'oka garden, where<BR>
The lady lies, your special care.<BR>
Be every lane and passage barred,<BR>
Set at each gate a chosen guard.<BR>
And with your troops, where danger calls,<BR>
Be ready to defend the walls.<BR>
Each movement of the V&aacute;nars mark;<BR>
Observe them when the sides grow dark;<BR>
Be ready in the dead of night,<BR>
And ere the morning bring the light.<BR>
Taught by our loss we may not scorn<BR>
These legions of the forest-born."<BR>

<P>
He ceased: the R&aacute;kshas lords obeyed;<BR>
Each at his post his troops arrayed:<BR>
And, torn with pangs that pierced him through<BR>
The monarch from the hall withdrew.<BR>
