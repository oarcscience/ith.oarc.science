<P>
Fair as Kail&aacute;sa white with snow<BR>
He saw a palace flash and glow,<BR>
A crystal pavement gem-inlaid,<BR>
And coral steps and colonnade,<BR>
And glittering towers that kissed the skies,<BR>
Whose dazzling splendour charmed his eyes.<BR>
There pallid, with neglected dress,<BR>
Watched close by fiend and giantess,<BR>
Her sweet face thin with constant flow<BR>
Of tears, with fasting and with woe;<BR>
Pale as the young moon's crescent when<BR>
The first faint light returns to men:<BR>

<P>

<P>
Dim as the flame when clouds of smoke<BR>
The latent glory hide and choke;<BR>
Like Rohin&iacute; the queen of stars<BR>
Oppressed by the red planet Mars;<BR>
From her dear friends and husband torn,<BR>
Amid the cruel fiends, forlorn,<BR>
Who fierce-eyed watch around her kept,<BR>
A tender woman sat and wept,<BR>
Her sobs, her sighs, her mournful mien,<BR>
Her glorious eyes, proclaimed the queen.<BR>
'This, this is she,' the V&aacute;nar cried,<BR>
'Fair as the moon and lotus-eyed,<BR>
I saw the giant R&aacute;van bear<BR>
A captive through the fields of air.<BR>
Such was the beauty of the dame;<BR>
Her form, her lips, her eyes the same.<BR>
This peerless queen whom I behold<BR>
Is R&aacute;ma's wife with limbs of gold.<BR>
Best of the sons of men is he,<BR>
And worthy of her lord is she.'<BR>
