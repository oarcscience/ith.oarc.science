### CANTO XLIII.: THE RUIN OF THE TEMPLE.

The Wind-God's son a temple  <span
id="fr_880"></span>[1b](ry382.htm#fn_880.md) scaled  
Which, by his fury unassailed,  
High as the hill of Meru, stood  
Amid the ruins of the wood;  
And in his fury thundered out  
Again his haughty battle-shout:  
'I am the slave of Kosal's King  
Whose wondrous deeds the minstrels sing.'  
Forth hurried, by that shout alarmed,  
The warders of the temple armed  
With every weapon haste supplied,  
And closed him in on every side,  
With bands that strove to pierce and strike  
With shaft and axe and club and pike.  
Then from its base the Vánar tore  
A pillar with the weight it bore.  
Against the wall the mass he dashed,  
And forth the flames in answer flashed,  
That wildly ran o'er roofs and wall  
In hungry rage consuming all.  
He whirled the pillar round his head  
And struck a hundred giants dead.  
Then high upheld on air he rose  
And called in thunder to his foes:  
'A thousand Vánar chiefs like me  
Roam at their will o'er land and sea,  
Terrific might we all possess:  
Our stormy speed is limitless.  
And all, unconquered in the fray,  
Our king Sugríva's word obey.  
Backed by his bravest myriads, he  
Our warrior lord will cross the sea,  
Then Lanká's lofty towers, and all  
Your hosts and Rávan's self shall fall.  
None shall be left unslaughtered; none  
Who braves the wrath of Raghu's son.'
