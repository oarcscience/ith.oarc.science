### CANTO LIII.: VAJRADANSHTRA'S SALLY.

When Rávan in his palace heard  
The mournful news, his wrath was stirred;  
And, gasping like a furious snake,  
To Vajradanshtra thus he spake:  

'Go forth, my fiercest captain, lead  
The bravest of the giants' breed.  
Go forth, the sons of Raghu slay  
And by their side Sugríva lay.'  

He ceased: the chieftain bowed his head  
And forth with gathered troops he sped.  
Cars, camels, steeds were well arrayed,  
And coloured banners o'er them played.  
Rings decked his arms: about his waist  
The life-protecting mail was braced,  
And on the chieftain's forehead set  
Glittered his cap and coronet.  
Home on a bannered car that glowed  
With golden sheen the warrior rode.  
And footmen marched with spear and sword  
And bow and mace behind their lord.  
In pomp and pride of warlike state  
They sallied from the southern gate,  
But saw, as on their way they sped,  
Dread signs around and overhead.  
For there were meteors falling fast,  
Though not a cloud its shadow cast;  
And each ill-omened bird and beast,  
Forboding death, the fear increased,  
While many a giant slipped and reeled,  
Falling before he reached the field.  
They met in mortal strife engaged,  
And long and fierce the battle raged.  
Spears, swords uplifted, gleamed and flashed,  
And many a chief to earth was dashed.  
A ceaseless storm of arrows rained,  
And limbs were pierced and blood-distained.  
Terrific was the sound that filled  
The air, and every heart was chilled,  
As hurtling o'er the giants flew  
The rocks and trees which Vánars threw.  
Fierce as a hungry lion when  
Unwary deer approach his den,

Angad, his eyes with fury red,  
Waving a tree above his head.  
Rushed with wild charge which none could stay  
Where stood the giants' dense array.  
Like tall trees levelled by the blast  
Before him fell the giants fast,  
And earth that streamed with blood was strown  
With warriors, steeds, and cars o'erthrown.
