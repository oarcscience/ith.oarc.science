### CANTO CXIII.: MANDODARÍ'S LAMENT.

While thus they wept, supreme in place,  
The loveliest for form and face.  
Mandodarí drew near alone,  
Looked on her lord and made her moan:  
'Ah Monarch, Indra feared to stand  
In fight before thy conquering hand.  
From thy dread spear the Immortals ran;  
And art thou murdered by a man?  
Ah,'twas no child of earth, I know,  
That smote thee with that mortal blow.  
'Twas Death himself in Ráma's shape,  
That slew thee: Death whom none escape.  
Or was it he who rules the skies  
Who met thee, clothed in man's disguise?  
Ah no, my lord, not Indra: he  
In battle ne'er could look on thee.  
One only God thy match I deem:  
It was Vishnu's self, the Lord Supreme,  
Whose days through ceaseless time extend  
And ne'er began and ne'er shall end:  
He with the discus, shell, and mace.  
Brought ruin on the giant race.  
Girt by the Gods of heaven arrayed  
Like Vánar hosts his strength to aid,  
He Ráma's shape and arms assumed  

<span id="page_495">p. 495</span>  

And slew the king whom Fate had doomed,  
In Janasthán when Khara died  
With giant legions by his side,  
No mortal was the unconquered foe  
In Ráma's form who struck the blow.  
When Hanumán the Vanár came  
And burnt thy town with hostile flame,  
I counselled peace in anxious fear:  
I counselled, but thou wouldst not hear.  
Thy fancy for the foreign dame  
Has brought thee death and endless shame.  
Why should thy foolish fancy roam?  
Hadst thou not wives as fair at home?  
In beauty, form and grace could she,  
Dear lord, surpass or rival me?  
Now will the days of Sítá glide  
In tranquil joy by Ráma's side:  
And I--ah me, around me raves  
A sea of woe with whelming waves.  
With thee in days of old I trod  
Each spot beloved by nymph and God;  
I stood with thee in proud delight  
On Mandar's side and Meru's height;  
With thee, my lord, enchanted strayed  
In Chaitraratha's  <span id="fr_1036"></span>[1](#fn_1036.md) lovely
shade,  
And viewed each fairest scene afar  
Transported in thy radiant car.  
But source of every joy wast thou,  
And all my bliss is ended now.  

Then Ráma to Víbhíshan cried:  
'Whate'er the ritual bids, provide.  
Obsequial honours duly pay,  
And these sad mourners grief allay.'  
Vibhíshan answered, wise and true.  
For duty's changeless law he knew:  
'Nay one who scorned all sacred vows  
And dared to touch another's spouse,  
Fell tyrant of the human race,  
With funeral rites I may not grace.'  

Him Raghu's royal son, the best  
Of those who love the law, addressed:  
'False was the rover of the night,  
He loved the wrong and scorned the right.  
Yet for the fallen warrior plead  
The dauntless heart, the valorous deed.  
Let him who ne'er had brooked defeat,  
The chief whom Indra feared to meet,  
The ever-conquering lord, obtain  
The honours that should grace the slain.'  
Vibhíshan bade his friends prepare  
The funeral rites with thoughtful care.  
Himself the royal palace sought  
Whence sacred fire was quickly brought,  
With sandal wood and precious scents  
And pearl and coral ornaments.  
Wise Bráhmans, while the tears that flowed  
Down their wan cheeks their sorrow sowed,  

Upon a golden litter laid  
The corpse in finest ropes arrayed.  
Thereon were flowers and pennons hung,  
And loud the monarch's praise was sung.  
Then was the golden litter raised,  
While holy fire in order blazed.  
And first in place Vibhíshan led  
The slow procession of the dead,  
Behind, their cheeks with tears bedewed,  
Came sad the widowed multitude.  
Where, raised as Bráhmans ordered, stood  
Piled sandal logs, and scented wood,  
The body of the king was set  
High on a deerskin coverlet.  
Then duly to the monarch's shade  
The offerings for the dead they paid,  
And southward on the eastern side  
An altar formed and fire supplied.  
Then on the shoulder of the dead  
The oil and clotted milk were shed.  
All rites were done as rules ordain:  
The sacrificial goat was slain.  
Next on the corpse were perfumes thrown  
And many a flowery wreath was strown;  
And with Vibhíshan's ready aid  
Rich vesture o'er the king was laid.  
Then while the tears their cheeks bedewed  
Parched grain upon the dead they strewed;  
Last, to the wood, as rules require,  
Vibhíshan set the kindling fire.  

Then having bathed, as texts ordain,  
To Lanká went the mourning train.  
Vibhíshan, when his task was done,  
Stood by the side of Raghu's son.  
And Ráma, freed from every foe,  
Unstrung at last his deadly bow,  
And laid the glittering shafts aside.  
And mail by Indra's love supplied.
