### CANTO XXIX.: KHARA'S DEFEAT.

When Ráma saw the giant nigh.  
On foot, alone, with mace reared high,  
In mild reproof at first he spoke.  
Then forth his threatening anger broke:  
'Thou with the host 'twas thine to lead,  
With elephant and car and steed,  
Hast wrought an act of sin and shame,  
An act which all who live must blame.  
Know that the wretch whose evil mind  
Through the grief of human kind,  
Through the three worlds confess him lord,  
Must perish dreaded and abhorred.  
Night-rover, when a villain's deeds  
Distress the world he little heeds,  
Each hand is armed his life to take,  
And crush him like a deadly snake.  
The end is near when men begin  
Through greed or lust a life of sin,  
E'en as a Bráhman's dame, unwise,  
Eats of the fallen hail  <span id="fr_476"></span>[1](#fn_476) and
dies.  

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>  

Thy hand has slain the pure and good,  
The hermit saints of Dandak wood,  
Of holy life, the heirs of bliss;  
And thou shalt reap the fruit of this.  
Not long shall they whose cruel breasts  
Joy in the sin the world detests  
Retain their guilty power and pride,  
But fade like trees whose roots are dried.  
Yes, as the seasons come and go.  
Each tree its kindly fruit must show,  
And sinners reap in fitting time  
The harvest of each earlier crime.  
As those must surely die who eat  
Unwittingly of poisoned meat,  
They too whose lives in sin are spent  
Receive ere long the punishment.  
And know, thou rover of the night,  
That I, a king, am sent to smite  
The wicked down, who court the hate  
Of men whose laws they violate.  
This day my vengeful hand shall send  
Shafts bright with gold to tear and rend,  
And pass with fury through thy breast  
As serpents pierce an emmet's nest.  
Thou with thy host this day shalt be  
Among the dead below, and see  
The saints beneath thy hand who bled,  
Whose flesh thy cruel maw has fed.  
They, glorious on their seats of gold,  
Their slayer shall in hell behold.  
Fight with all strength thou callest thine,  
Mean scion of ignoble line,  
Still, like the palm-tree's fruit, this day  
My shafts thy head in dust shall lay.'  

Such were the words that Ráma said:  
Then Khara's eyes with wrath glowed red,  
Who, maddened by the rage that burned  
Within him, with a smile returned:  

'Thou Das'aratha's son, hast slain  
The meaner giants of my train:  
And canst thou idly vaunt thy might  
And claim the praise not thine by right?  
Not thus in self-laudation rave  
The truly great, the nobly brave:  
No empty boasts like thine disgrace  
The foremost of the human race.  
The mean of soul, unknown to fame,  
Who taint their warrior race with shame,  
Thus speak in senseless pride as thou,  
O Raghu's son, hast boasted now,  
What hero, when the war-dry rings,  
Vaunts the high race from which he springs,  
Or seeks, when warriors meet and die.  
His own descent to glorify?  
Weakness and folly show confessed  
In every vaunt thou utterest,  
As when the flames fed high with grass  
Detect the \*simulating\* brass,  
Dost thou note see me standing here  
Armed with the mighty mace I rear,  
\*Firm\* as an earth upholding hill  
Whose summit veins of metal fill?  
Lo, here I stand before thy face  
To slay thee with my murderous mace,  
As Death, the universal lord,  
Stands threatening with his fatal cord.  
Enough of this. Much more remains  
That should be said: but time constrains.  
Ere to his rest the sun descend,  
And shades of night the combat end,  
The twice seven thousand of my band  
Who fell beneath thy bloody hand  
Shall have their tears all wiped away  
And triumph in thy fall to-day.'  

He spoke, and loosing from his hold  
His mighty mace ringed round with gold,  
Like some red bolt alive with fire  
Hurled it at Ráma, mad with ire.  
The ponderous mace which Khara threw  
Sent fiery flashes as it flew.  
Trees, shrubs were scorched beneath the blast,  
As onward to its aim it passed.  
But Ráma, watching as it sped  
Dire as His noose who rules the dead,  
Cleft it with arrows as it came  
On rushing with a hiss and flame.  
Its fury spent and burnt away,  
Harmless upon the ground it lay  
Like a great snake in furious mood  
By herbs of numbing power subdued.
