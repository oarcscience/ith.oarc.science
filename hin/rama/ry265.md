### CANTO LXVII.: RÁMA APPEASED.

As Ráma, pierced by sorrow's sting,  
Lamented like a helpless thing,  
And by his mighty woe distraught  
Was last in maze of troubled thought,  
Sumitrá's son with loving care  
Consoled him in his wild despair,  
And while his feet he gently pressed  
With words like these the chief addressed;  
'For sternest vow and noblest deed  
Was Das'aratha blessed with seed.  
Thee for his son the king obtained,  
Like Amrit by the Gods regained.  
Thy gentle graces won his heart,  
And all too weak to live apart  
The monarch died, as Bharat told,  
And lives on high mid Gods enrolled.  

If thou, O Ráma, wilt not bear  
This grief which fills thee with despair,  
How shall a weaker man e'er hope,  
Infirm and mean, with woe to cope?  
Take heart, I pray thee, noblest chief:  
What man who breathes is free from grief?  
Misfortunes come and burn like flame,  
Then fly as quickly as they came.  
Yayáti son of Nahush reigned  
With Indra on the throne he gained.  
But falling for a light offence  
He mourned a while the consequence.  
Vasishtha, reverend saint and sage,  
Priest of our sire from youth to age,  
Begot a hundred sons, but they  
Were smitten in a single day.  <span id="fr_512"></span>[1](#fn_512.md)  
And she, the queen whom all revere,  
The mother whom we hold so dear,  
The earth herself not seldom feels  
Fierce fever when she shakes and reels.  
And those twin lights,the world's great eyes,  
On which the universe relies,--  
Does not eclipse at times assail  
Their brilliance till their fires grow pale?  
The mighty Powers, the Immortal Blest  
Bend to a law which none contest.  
No God, no bodied life is free  
From conquering Fate's supreme decree,  
E'en S'akra's self must reap the meed  
Of virtue and of sinful deed.  
And O great lord of men, wilt thou  
Helpless beneath thy misery bow?  
No, if thy dame be lost or dead,  
O hero, still be comforted,  
Nor yield for ever to thy woe  
O'ermastered like the mean and low.  
Thy peers, with keen far-reaching eyes,  
Spend not their hours in ceaseless sighs;  
In dire distress, in whelming ill  
Their manly looks are hopeful still.  
To this, great chief, thy reason bend,  
And earnestly the truth perpend.  
By reason's aid the wisest learn  
The good and evil to discern.  
With sin and goodness scarcely known  
Faint light by chequered lives is shown;  
Without some clear undoubted deed  
We mark not how the fruits succeed.  
In time of old, O thou most brave,  
To me thy lips such counsel gave.  
Vrihaspati  <span id="fr_513"></span>[2](#fn_513.md) can scarcely find  
New wisdom to instruct thy mind.  
For thine is wit and genious high  
Meet for the children of the sky.  
I rouse that heart benumbed by pain  
And call to vigorous life again.  
Be manly godlike vigour shown;  
Put forth that noblest strength, thine own.  

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>  

Strive, best of old Ikshváku's strain,  
Strive till the conquered foe be slain.  
Where is the profit or the joy  
If thy fierce rage the worlds destroy?  
Search till thou find the guilty foe,  
Then let thy hand no mercy show.'
