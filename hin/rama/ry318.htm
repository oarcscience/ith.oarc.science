To him on whom his soul relied,<BR>
With friendly words the monarch cried:<BR>
'O best of V&aacute;narsght can stay<BR>
By land or sea thy rapid way,<BR>
Who through the air thy flight canst bend,<BR>
And to the Immortals' home ascend.<BR>
All realms, I ween, are known to thee<BR>
With every mountain, lake, and sea.<BR>
In strength and speed which naught can tire<BR>
Thou, worthy rival of thy sire<BR>
The mighty monarch of the wind,<BR>
Where'er thou wilt a way canst find.<BR>
Exert thy power, O swift and strong,<BR>
Bring back the lady lost so long,<BR>
For time and place, O thou most wise,<BR>
Lie open to thy searching eyes.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When R&aacute;ma heard that special best<BR>
To Hanum&aacute;ne the rest,<BR>
He from the monarch's favour drew<BR>
Hope of success and trust anew<BR>
That he on whom his lord relied,<BR>
In toil and peril trained and tried,<BR>
Would to a happy issue bring<BR>
The task commanded by the king.<BR>
He gave the ring that bore his name,<BR>
A token for the captive dame,<BR>
That the sad lady in her woe<BR>
The missive of her lord might know.<BR>
'This ring,' he said, 'my wife will see,<BR>
Nor fear an envoy sent by me.<BR>
Thy valour and thy skill combined,<BR>
Thy resolute and vigorous mind,<BR>
And King Sugr&iacute;va's behest,<BR>
With joyful hopes inspire my breast.'<BR>

remarked, may have been a real people,
as they are mentioned in the Altareya
Br&aacute;hmanaI. 14 ... "Wherefore the
several nations who dwell in this northern
quarter, beyond the Himavat, the Uttara
Kurus and the Uttara Madras are consecrated
to glorious dominion, and people
term them the glorious. In another passage
of the same work, however, the Uttara
Kurus are treated as belonging to the
domain of mythology." MUIR's <I>Sanskrit

winds, more usually called Maruts, and
are often associated with Indra. In the
later mythology the Rudras are regarded
as inferior manifestations of S'iva, and
most of their names are also names of Siva.</P>
