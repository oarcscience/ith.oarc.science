<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXXIV.: GUHA'S ANGER.</H3>
<P>
King Guha saw the host spread o'er<BR>
The wide expanse of Gang&aacute;'s shore,<BR>
With waving flag and pennon graced,<BR>
And to his followers spoke in haste:<BR>
'A mighty army meets my eyes,<BR>
That rivals Ocean's self in size:<BR>
Where'er I look my very mind<BR>
No limit to the host can find.<BR>
Sure Bharat with some evil thought<BR>
His army to our land has brought.<BR>
See, huge of form, his flag he rears,<BR>
That like an Ebony-tree appears.<BR>
He comes with bonds to take and chain,<BR>
Or triumph o'er our people slain:<BR>
And after, R&aacute;ma will be slay,--<BR>
Him whom his father drove away:<BR>
The power complete he longs to gain.<BR>
And--task too hard--usurp the reign.<BR>

<P>

<P>
So Bharat comes with wicked will<BR>
His brother Rama's blood to spill.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma's slave and friend am I;<BR>
He is my lord and dear ally.<BR>
Keep here your watch in arms arrayed<BR>
Near Gang&aacute;'s flood to lend him aid,<BR>
And let my gathered servants stand<BR>
And line with troops the river strand.<BR>
Here let the river keepers meet.<BR>
Who flesh and roots and berries eat;<BR>
A hundred fishers man each boat<BR>
Of the five hundred here afloat,<BR>
And let the youthful and the strong<BR>
Assemble in defensive throng.<BR>
But yet, if, free from guilty thought<BR>
'Gainst R&aacute;ma, he this land have sought,<BR>
The prince's happy host to day<BR>
Across the flood shall make its way.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke: then bearing in a dish<BR>
A gift of honey, meat, and fish,<BR>
The king of the Nishadas drew<BR>
Toward Bharat for an interview.<BR>
When Bharat's noble charioteer<BR>
Observed the monarch hastening near,<BR>
He duly, skilled in courteous lore,<BR>
The tidings to his master bore:<BR>
'This aged prince who hither bends<BR>
His footsteps with a thousand friends,<BR>
Knows, firm ally of R&aacute;ma, all<BR>
That may in Danduk wood befall:<BR>
Therefore, Kakutstha's son, admit<BR>
The monarch, as is right and fit:<BR>
For doubtless he can clearly tell<BR>
Where R&aacute;ma now and Lakshman dwell.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When Bharat heard Sumantra's rede,<BR>
To his fair words the prince agreed:<BR>
'Go quickly forth,' he cried, 'and bring<BR>
Before my face the aged king.'<BR>
King Guha, with his kinsmen near,<BR>
Rejoiced the summoning to hear:<BR>
He nearer drew, bowed low his head,<BR>
And thus to royal Bharat said:<BR>
'No mansions can our country boast,<BR>
And unexpected comes thy host:<BR>
But what we have I give thee all:<BR>
Rest in the lodging of thy thrall.<BR>
See, the Nishadas here have brought<BR>
The fruit and roots their hands have sought:<BR>
And we have woodland fare beside.<BR>
And store of meat both fresh and dried.<BR>
To rest their weary limbs, I pray<BR>
This night at least thy host may stay:<BR>
Then cheered with all we can bestow<BR>
To-morrow thou with it mayst go.'<BR>
