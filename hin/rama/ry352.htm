<P>
Apart a dais of crystal rose<BR>
With couches spread for soft repose.<BR>
Adorned with gold and gems of price<BR>
Meet for the halls of Paradise.<BR>
A canopy was o'er them spread<BR>
Pale as the light the moon beams shed,<BR>
And female figures,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_820"></A><A HREF="#fn_820"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> deftly planned,<BR>
The faces of the sleepers fanned,<BR>
There on a splendid couch, asleep<BR>
On softest skins of deer and sheep.<BR>
Dark as a cloud that dims the day<BR>
The monarch of the giants lay,<BR>
Perfumed with sandal's precious scent<BR>
And gay with golden ornament.<BR>

His fiery eyes in slumber closed,<BR>
In glittering robes the king reposed<BR>
Like Mandar's mighty hill asleep<BR>
With flowery trees that clothe his steep.<BR>
Near and more near the V&aacute;nar<BR>
The monarch of the fiends to view,<BR>
And saw the giant stretched supine<BR>
Fatigued with play and drunk with wine.<BR>
While, shaking all the monstrous frame,<BR>
His breath like hissing serpents' came.<BR>
With gold and glittering bracelets gay<BR>
His mighty arms extended lay<BR>
Huge as the towering shafts that bear<BR>
The flag of Indra high in air.<BR>
Scars by Air&aacute;vat's impressed<BR>
Showed red upon his shaggy breast.<BR>
And on his shoulders were displayed<BR>
The dints the thunder-bolt had made. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_821"></A><A HREF="ry353.htm#fn_821"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
The spouses of the giant king<BR>
Around their lord were slumbering,<BR>
And, gay with sparkling earrings, shone<BR>
Fair as the moon to look upon.<BR>
There by her husband's side was seen<BR>
Mandodar&iacute;favourite queen,<BR>
The beauty of whose youthful face<BR>
Beamed a soft glory through the place.<BR>
The V&aacute;nared the dame more fair<BR>
Than all the royal ladies there,<BR>
And thought, 'These rarest beauties speak<BR>
The matchless dame I come to seek.<BR>
Peerless in grace and splendour, she<BR>
The Maithil queen must surely be.'<BR>
