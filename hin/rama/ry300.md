### CANTO XXVI.: THE CORONATION.

Each Vánar councillor and peer  
In crowded numbers gathered near  
Sugriva, mournful king, while yet  
His vesture from the wave was wet,  
Before the chief of Raghu's seed  
Unwearied in each arduous deed,  
They stood and raised the reverent hand  
As saints before Lord Brahmá stand,  
Then Hanumán of massive mould,  
Like some tall hill of glistering gold,  
Son of the God whose wild blasts shake  
The forest, thus to Ráma spake:  
'By thy kind favour, O my lord,  
Sugríva, to his home restored  
Triumphant, has regained to-day  
His rank and power and royal sway.  
He now will call each faithful friend,  
Enter the city, and attend  
With sage advice and prudent care  
To every task that waits him there.  
Then balm and unguent shall anoint  
Our monarch, as the laws appoint,  
And gems and precious wreaths shall be  
His grateful offering, King, to thee.  
Do thou, O Ráma, with thy friend  
Thy steps within the city bend;  
Our ruler on his throne install,  
And with thy presence cheer us all.'  
   Then, skilled in lore and arts that guide  
The speaker, Raghu's son replied:  
'For fourteen years I might not break  
The mandate that my father spake;  
Nor can I, till that time be fled,  
The street of town or village tread.  
Let King Sugríva seek the town  
Most worthy of her high renown,  
There let him be without delay  
Anointed, and begin his sway.  
   This answered, to Sugríva then  
Thus spake anew the king of men:  
'Do thou who knowest right ordain  
Prince Angad consort of thy reign;  
For he is noble, true, and bold,  
And trained a righteous course to hold  
Gifts like his sire's thait youth adorn  
Born eldest to the eldest born.  

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>  

This is the month of Srávana <span
id="fr_613"></span>[1](#fn_613.md)first  
Of those that see the rain-clouds burst.  
Four months, thou knowest well, extends  
The season when the rain descends.  
No time for deeds of war is this.  
Seek thou thy fair metropolis,  
And I with Lakshman, O my friend,  
The time upon this hill will spend.  
An ample cavern opens there  
Made lovely by the mountain air,  
And lotuses and lilies fill  
The pleasant lake and murmuring rill.  
When Kártik's  <span id="fr_614"></span>[2](#fn_614.md) month shall clear
the skies,  
Then tempt the mighty enterprise.  
Now, chieftain to thy home repair,  
And be anointed sovereign there.'  

Sugríva heard: he bowed his head:  
Within the lovely town he sped  
Which Bali's royal will had swayed,  
Where thousand Vánar chiefs arrayed  
Gathered in order round their king,  
And led him on with welcoming.  
Low on the earth the lesser crowd  
Fell in prostration as they bowed.  
Sugríva looked with grateful eyes,  
Spake to them all and bade them rise.  
Then through the royal bowers he strode  
Wherein the monarch's wives abode.  
Soon from the inner chambers came  
The Vánar of exalted fame;  
And joyful friends drew near and shed  
King-making balm upon his head,  
Like Gods anointing in the skies  
Their sovereign of the thousand eyes.  <span
id="fr_615"></span>[3](#fn_615.md)  
Then brought they, o'er their king to hold  
The white umbrella decked with gold,  
And chouries with their waving hair  
In golden handles wondrous fair;  
And fragrant herbs and seed and spice,  
And sparkling gems exceeding price,  
And every bloom from woods and leas,  

And gum distilled from milky trees;  
And precious ointment white as milk,  
And spotless robes of cloth and silk,  
Wreaths of sweet flowers whose glories gleam  
In grassy grove, on lake or stream.  
And fragrant sandal and each scent  
That makes the soft breeze redolent;  
Grain, honey, odorous seed, and store  
Of oil and curd and golden ore;  
A noble tiger's skin, a pair  
Of sandals wrought with costliest care,  
Eight pairs of damsels drawing nigh  
Brought unguents stained with varied dye.  
Then gems and cates and robes displayed  
Before the twice-born priests were laid,  
That they would deign in order due  
To consecrate the king anew.  
The sacred grass was duly spread  
And sacrificial flame was fed,  
Which Scripture-learned priests supplied  
With oil which texts had sanctified.  
Then, with all rites ordained of old,  
High on the terrace bright with gold,  
Whereon a glorious carpet lay,  
And fresh-culled garlands sweet and gay,  
Placed on his throne, Sugríva bent  
His looks toward the Orient.  
In horns from forehead of the bull.  
In pitchers bright and beautiful,  
In urns of gold the Vánara took  
Pure water brought from stream and brook,  
From every consecrated strand  
And every sea that beats the land.  
Then, as prescribed by sacred lore  
And many a mighty sage of yore,  <span
id="fr_616"></span>[1b](#fn_616.md)  
The leaders of the Vánars poured  
The sacred water on their lord.  <span
id="fr_617"></span>[2b](#fn_617.md)  
From every Vánar at the close  
Of that imperial rite arose  
Shouts of glad triumph, loud and long  
Repeated by the high-souled throng.  
Sugríva, when the rite was done,  
Obeyed the hest of Raghu's son.  
Prince Angad to his breast he strained.  
And partner of his sway ordained.  
Once more from all the host rang out  
The loud huzza and jovful shout.  
'Well done! well done!' each Vánar cried.  
And good Sugríva glorified.  

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>  

Then with glad voices loudly raised  
Were Ráma and his brother praised;  
And bright Kishkindha shone that day  
With happy throngs and banners gay.

the preparations made for Rama's consecration, Book II. Canto III. Thus
Homer frequently introduces into Troy the rites of Hellenic worship.
