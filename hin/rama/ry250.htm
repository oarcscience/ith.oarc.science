<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LII.: R&Aacute;VAN'S FLIGHT.</H3>
<P>
Fair as the lord of silvery rays<BR>
Whom every star in heaven obeys,<BR>
The Maithil dame her plaint renewed<BR>
O'er him by R&aacute;van's might subdued:<BR>
'Dreams, omens, auguries foreshow<BR>
Our coming lot of weal and woe:<BR>
But thou, my R&aacute;ma, couldst not see<BR>
The grievous blow which falls on thee.<BR>
The birds and deer desert the brakes<BR>
And show the path my captor takes,<BR>
And thus e'en now this royal bird<BR>
Flew to mine aid by pity stirred.<BR>
Slain for my sake in death he lies,<BR>
The broad-winged rover of the skies.<BR>
O R&aacute;ma, haste, thine aid I crave:<BR>
O Lakshman, why delay to save?<BR>
Brave sons of old Ikshv&aacute;ku, hear<BR>
And rescue in this hour of fear.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Her flowery wreath was torn and rent,<BR>
Crushed was each sparkling ornament.<BR>
She with weak arms and trembling knees<BR>
Clung like a creeper to the trees,<BR>
And like some poor deserted thing<BR>
With wild shrieks made the forest ring.<BR>
But swift the giant reached her side,<BR>
<A NAME="page_291"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 291</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
As loud on R&aacute;ma's name she cried.<BR>
Fierce as grim Death one hand he laid<BR>
Upon her tresses' lovely braid.<BR>
That touch, thou impious King, shall be<BR>
The ruin of thy race and thee.<BR>
The universal world in awe<BR>
That outrage on the lady saw.<BR>
All nature shook convulsed with dread,<BR>
And darkness o'er the land was spread.<BR>
The Lord of Day grew dark and chill,<BR>
And every breath of air was still.<BR>
The Eternal Father of the sky<BR>
Beheld the crime with heavenly eye.<BR>
And spake with solemn voice, 'The deed,<BR>
The deed is done, of old decreed.'<BR>
Sad were the saints within the grove,<BR>
But triumph with their sorrow strove.<BR>
They wept to see the Maithil dame<BR>
Endure the outrage, scorn, and shame:<BR>
They joyed because his life should pay<BR>
The penalty incurred that day.<BR>
Then R&aacute;van raised her up, and bare<BR>
His captive through the fields of air,<BR>
Calling with accents loud and shrill<BR>
On R&aacute;ma and on Lakshman still.<BR>
With sparkling gems on arm and breast,<BR>
In silk of paly amber dressed,<BR>
High in the air the Maithil dame<BR>
Gleamed like the lightning's flashing flame.<BR>
The giant, as the breezes blew<BR>
Upon her robes of amber hue,<BR>
And round him twined that gay attire,<BR>
Showed like a mountain girt with fire.<BR>
The lady, fairest of the fair,<BR>
Had wreathed a garland round her hair;<BR>
Its lotus petals bright and sweet<BR>
Rained down about the giant's feet.<BR>
Her vesture, bright as burning gold,<BR>
Gave to the wind each glittering fold,<BR>
Fair as a gilded cloud that gleams<BR>
Touched by the Day-God's tempered beams.<BR>
Yet struggling in the fiend's embrace,<BR>
The lady with her sweet pure face,<BR>
Far from her lord, no longer wore<BR>
The light of joy that shone before.<BR>
Like some sad lily by the side<BR>
Of waters which the sun has dried;<BR>
Like the pale moon uprising through<BR>
An autumn cloud of darkest hue,<BR>
So was her perfect face between<BR>
The arms of giant R&aacute;van seen:<BR>
Fair with the charm of braided tress<BR>
And forehead's finished loveliness;<BR>
Fair with the ivory teeth that shed<BR>
White lustre through the lips' fine red,<BR>
Fair as the lotus when the bud<BR>
Is rising from the parent flood.<BR>
With faultless lip and nose and eye.<BR>
Dear as the moon that floods the sky<BR>
With gentle light, of perfect mould,<BR>
She seemed a thing of burnished gold,<BR>

<P>
Though on her cheek the traces lay<BR>
Of tears her hand had brushed away,<BR>
But as the moon-beams swiftly fade<BR>
Ere the great Day-God shines displayed,<BR>
So in that form of perfect grace<BR>
Still trembling in the fiend's embrace,<BR>
From her beloved R&aacute;ma reft,<BR>
No light of pride or joy was left.<BR>
The lady with her golden hue<BR>
O'er the swart fiend a lustre threw,<BR>
As when embroidered girths enfold<BR>
An elephant with gleams of gold.<BR>
Fair as the lily's bending stem<BR>
Her arms adorned with many a gem,<BR>
A lustre to the fiend she lent<BR>
Gleaming from every ornament,<BR>
As when the cloud-shot flashes light<BR>
The shadows of a mountain height.<BR>
Whene'er the breezes earthward bore<BR>
The tinkling of the zone she wore,<BR>
He seemed a cloud of darkness hue<BR>
Sending forth murmurs as it flew.<BR>
As on her way the dame was sped<BR>
From her sweet neck fair flowers were shed,<BR>
The swift wind caught the flowery rain<BR>
And poured it o'er the fiend again.<BR>
The wind-stirred blossoms, sweet to smell,<BR>
On the dark brows of R&aacute;van fell,<BR>
Like lunar constellations set<BR>
On Meru for a coronet.<BR>
From her small foot an anklet fair<BR>
With jewels slipped, and through the air,<BR>
Like a bright circlet of the flame<BR>
Of thunder, to the valley came.<BR>
The Maithil lady, fair to see<BR>
As the young leaflet of a tree<BR>
Clad in the tender hues of spring,<BR>
Flashed glory on the giant king,<BR>
As when a gold-embroidered zone<BR>
Around an elephant is thrown.<BR>
While, bearing far the lady, through<BR>
The realms of sky the giant flew,<BR>
She like a gleaming meteor cast<BR>
A glory round her as she passed.<BR>
Then from each limb in swift descent<BR>
Dropped many a sparkling ornament:<BR>
On earth they rested dim and pale<BR>
Like fallen stars when virtues fail.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Around her neck a garland lay<BR>
Bright as the Star-God's silvery ray:<BR>
It fell and flashed like Gang&aacute; sent<BR>
From heaven above the firmament.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
The birds of every wing had flocked<BR>
To stately trees by breezes rocked:<BR>

<P>
These bowed their wind-swept heads and<BR>
said:<BR>
'My lady sweet, be comforted.'<BR>
With faded blooms each brook within<BR>
Whose waters moved no gleamy fin,<BR>
Stole sadly through the forest dell<BR>
Mourning the dame it loved so well.<BR>
From every woodland region near<BR>
Came lions, tigers, birds, and deer,<BR>
And followed, each with furious look,<BR>
The way her flying shadow took.<BR>
For S&iacute;t&aacute;'s loss each lofty hill<BR>
Whose tears were waterfall, and rill,<BR>
Lifting on high each arm-like steep,<BR>
Seemed in the general woe to weep.<BR>
When the great sun, the lord of day,<BR>
Saw R&aacute;van tear the dame away,<BR>
His glorious light began to fail<BR>
And all his disk grew cold and pale.<BR>
'If R&aacute;van from the forest hies**<BR>
With R&aacute;ma's S&iacute;t&aacute; as his prize,<BR>
Justice and truth have vanished hence,<BR>
Honour and right and innocence.'<BR>
Thus rose the cry of wild despair<BR>
From spirits as they gathered there.<BR>
In trembling troops in open lawns<BR>
Wept, wild with woe, the startled fawns,<BR>
And a strange terror changed the eyes<BR>
They lifted to the distant skies.<BR>
On silvan Gods who love the dell<BR>
A sudden fear and trembling fell,<BR>
As in the deepest woe they viewed<BR>
The lady by the fiend subdued.<BR>
Still in loud shrieks was heard afar<BR>
That voice whose sweetness naught could<BR>
mar,<BR>
While eager looks of fear and woe<BR>
She bent upon the earth below.<BR>
The lady of each winning wile<BR>
With pearly teeth and lovely smile,<BR>
Seized by the lord of Lank&aacute;'s isle,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Looked down for friends in vain.<BR>
She saw no friend to aid her, none,<BR>
Not R&aacute;ma nor the younger son<BR>
Of Das'aratha, and undone<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  She swooned with fear and pain.<BR>
