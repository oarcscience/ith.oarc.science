### CANTO XXXIX.: COUNSEL TO SÍTÁ.

Scarce had the sire, with each dear queen,  
Heard Ráma's pleading voice, and seen  
His darling in his hermit dress  
Ere failed his senses for distress.  
Convulsed with woe, his soul that shook,  
On Raghu's son he could not look;  
Or if he looked with failing eye  
He could not to the chief reply.  
By pangs of bitter grief assailed,  
The long-armed monarch wept and wailed,  
Half dead a while and sore distraught,  
While Ráma filled his every thought.  
'This hand of mine in days ere now  
Has reft her young from many a cow.  
Or living things has idly slain:  
Hence comes, I ween, this hour of pain.  
Not till the hour is come to die  
Can from its shell the spirit fly.  
Death comes not, and Kaikeyí still  
Torments the wretch she cannot kill,  
Who sees his son before him quit  
The fine soft robes his rank that fit,  
And, glorious as the burning fire,  
In hermit garb his limbs attire.  
Now all the people grieve and groan  
Through Queen Kaikeyí's deed alone,  
Who, having dared this deed of sin,  
Strives for herself the gain to win.'  

He spoke. With tears his eyes grew dim,  
His senses all deserted him.  
He cried, O Ráma, once, then weak  
And fainting could no further speak.  
Unconscious there he lay: at length  
Regathering his sense and strength,  
While his full eyes their torrents shed,  
To wise Sumantra thus he said:  
'Yoke the light car, and hither lead  
Fleet coursers of the noblest breed,  
And drive this heir of lofty fate  
Beyond the limit of the state.  
This seems the fruit that virtues bear,  
The meed of worth which texts declare--  
The sending of the brave and good  
By sire and mother to the wood.'  

He heard the monarch, and obeyed,  
With ready feet that ne'er delayed,  
And brought before the palace gate  
The horses and the car of state.  
Then to the monarch's son he sped,  
And raising hands of reverence said  

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>  

That the light car which gold made fair,  
With best of steeds, was standing there.  
King Das'aratha called in haste  
The lord o'er all his treasures placed.  
And spoke, well skilled in place and time,  
His will to him devoid of crime:  
'Count all the years she has to live  
Afar in forest wilds, and give  
To Sítá robes and gems of price  
As for the time may well suffice.'  
Quick to the treasure-room he went,  
Charged by that king most excellent,  
Brought the rich stores, and gave them all  
To Sítá in the monarch's hall.  
The Maithil dame of high descent  
Received each robe and ornament,  
And tricked those limbs, whose lines foretold  
High destiny, with gems and gold.  
So well adorned, so fair to view,  
A glory through the hall she threw:  
So, when the Lord of Light upsprings,  
His radiance o'er the sky he flings.  
Then Queen Kaus'alyá spake at last,  
With loving arms about her cast,  
Pressed lingering kisses on her head,  
And to the high-souled lady said:  
'Ah, in this faithless world below  
When dark misfortune comes and woe,  
Wives, loved and cherished every day,  
Neglect their lords and disobey.  
Yes, woman's nature still is this:--  
After long days of calm and bliss  
When some light grief her spirit tries,  
She changes all her love, or flies.  
Young wives are thankless, false in soul,  
With roving hearts that spurn control.  
Brooding on sin and quickly changed,  
In one short hour their love estranged.  
Not glorious deed or lineage fair,  
Not knowledge, gift, or tender care  
In chains of lasting love can bind  
A woman's light inconstant mind.  
But those good dames who still maintain  
What right, truth, Scripture, rule ordain--  
No holy thing in their pure eyes  
With one beloved husband vies.  
Nor let thy lord my son, condemned  
To exile, be by thee contemned,  
For be he poor or wealthy, he  
Is as a God, dear child, to thee.'  

When Sítá heard Kaus'alyá's speech  
Her duty and her gain to teach,  
She joined her palms with reverent grace  
And gave her answer face to face:  
'All will I do, forgetting naught,  
Which thou,O honoured Queen, hast taught.  
I know, have heard, and deep have stored  
The rules of duty to my lord.  
Not me, good Queen, shouldst thou include  
Among the faithless multitude.  
Its own sweet light the moon shall leave  
Ere I to duty cease to cleave.  
The stringless lute gives forth no strain,  
The wheelless car is urged in vain;  
No joy a lordless dame, although  
Blest with a hundred sons, can know.  
From father, brother, and from son  
A measured share of joy is won:  
Who would not honour, love, and bless  
Her lord, whose gifts are measureless?  
Thus trained to think, I hold in awe  
Scripture's command and duty's law.  
Him can I hold in slight esteem?  
Her lord is woman's God, I deem.'  
Kaus'alyá heard the lady's speech,  
Nor failed those words her heart to reach.  
Then, pure in mind, she gave to flow  
The tear that sprang of joy and woe.  
Then duteous Ráma forward came  
And stood before the honoured dame,  
And joining reverent hands addressed  
The queen in rank above the rest:  
'O mother, from these tears refrain;  
Look on my sire and still thy pain.  
To thee my days afar shall fly  
As if sweet slumber closed thine eye,  
And fourteen years of exile seem  
To thee, dear mother, like a dream.  
On me returning safe and well,  
Girt by my friends, thine eyes shall dwell.'  

Thus for their deep affection's sake  
The hero to his mother spake,  
Then to the half seven hundred too.  
Wives of his sire, paid reverence due.  
Thus Das'aratha's son addressed  
That crowd of matrons sore distressed:  
'If from these lips, while here I dwelt,  
One heedless taunt you e'er have felt,  
Forgive me, pray. And now adieu,  
I bid good-bye to all of you.'  
Then straight, like curlews' cries, upwent  
The voices of their wild lament,  
While, as he bade farewell, the crowd  
Of royal women wept aloud,  
And through the ample hall's extent.  
Where erst the sound of tabour, blent  
With drum and shrill-toned instrument,  
   In joyous concert rose,  
Now rang the sound of wailing high,  
The lamentation and the cry,  
The shriek, the choking sob, the sigh  
   That told the ladies' woes.
