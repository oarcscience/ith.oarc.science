<P>
There ceased the V&aacute;nar: R&aacute;ma pressed<BR>
The treasured jewel to his breast,<BR>
And from his eyes the waters broke<BR>
As to the V&aacute;nar king he spoke:<BR>
'As o'er her babe the mother weeps,<BR>
This flood of tears the jewel steeps.<BR>
This gem that shone on S&iacute;t&aacute;'s head<BR>
Was Janak'a gift when we were wed,<BR>
And the pure brow that wore it lent<BR>
New splendour to the ornament.<BR>
This gem, bright offspring of the wave,<BR>
The King of Heaven to Janak gave,<BR>
Whose noble sacrificial rite<BR>
Had filled the God with new delight.<BR>
Now, as I gaze upon the prize,<BR>
Methinks I see my father's eyes.<BR>
Methinks I see before me stand<BR>
The ruler of Videha's land.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_903"></A><A HREF="#fn_903"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Methinks mine arms are folded now<BR>
Round her who wore it on her brow.<BR>
Speak, Hanum&aacute;n, O say, dear friend,<BR>
What message did my darling send?<BR>
O speak, and let thy words impart<BR>
Their gentle dew to cool my heart.<BR>
Ah, 'tis the crown of woe to see<BR>
This gem and ask 'Where, where is she?'<BR>
If for one month her heart be strong,<BR>
Her days of life will yet be long.<BR>
But I, with naught to lend relief,<BR>
This very day must die of grief.<BR>
Come, Hanum&aacute;n, and quickly guide<BR>
The mourner to his darling's side.<BR>
O lead me--thou hast learnt the way--<BR>
I cannot and I will not stay.<BR>
How can my gentle love endure,<BR>
So timid, delicate, and pure,<BR>
The dreadful demons fierce and vile<BR>
Who watch her in the guarded isle?<BR>
No more the light of beauty shines<BR>
From S&iacute;t&aacute; as she weeps and pines.<BR>
But pain and sorrow, cloud on cloud.<BR>
Her moonlight glory dim and shroud.<BR>
O speak, dear Hanum&aacute;n, and tell<BR>
Each word that from her sweet lips fell,<BR>
Her words, her words alone can give<BR>
The healing balm to make me live.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_904"></A><A HREF="#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>

in Behar.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_904"></A><A HREF="ry398.htm#fr_904">427:2</A>  The original contains two more Cantos
which end the Book, Canto LXVII begins
thus: 'Hanum&aacute;n thus addressed by the
great-souled son of Raghu related to the
son of Raghu all that S&iacute;t&aacute; had said.' And
the two Cantos contain nothing but
Hanum&aacute;n's account of his interview with
S&iacute;t&aacute;, and the report of his own speeches
as well as of hers.</P>
