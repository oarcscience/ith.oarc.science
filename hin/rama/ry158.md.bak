### CANTO LXXX.: THE WAY PREPARED.

All they who knew the joiner's art,  
Or distant ground in every part;  
Each busied in his several trade,  
To work machines or ply the spade;  
Deft workmen skilled to frame the wheel,  
Or with the ponderous engine deal;  
Guides of the way, and craftsmen skilled,  
To sink the well, make bricks, and build;  
And those whose hands the tree could hew,  
And work with slips of cut bamboo,  
Went forward, and to guide them, they  
Whose eyes before had seen the way.  
Then onward in triumphant mood  
Went all the mighty multitude.  
Like the great sea whose waves leap high  
When the full moon is in the sky.  
Then, in his proper duty skilled,  
Each joined him to his several guild,  
And onward in advance they went  
With every tool and implement.  
Where bush and tangled creeper lay  
With trenchant steel they made the way;  
They felled each stump, removed each stone,  
And many a tree was overthrown.  
In other spots, on desert lands,  
Tall trees were reared by busy hands.  
Where'er the line of road they took,  
They plied the hatchet, axe, and hook.

Others, with all their strength applied,  
Cast vigorous plants and shrubs aside,  
In shelving valleys rooted deep,  
And levelled every dale and steep.  
Each pit and hole that stopped the way  
They filled with stones, and mud, and clay.  
And all the ground that rose and fell  
With busy care was levelled well.  
They bridged ravines with ceaseless toil,  
And pounded fine the flinty soil.  
Now here, now there, to right and left,  
A passage through the ground they cleft,  
And soon the rushing flood was led  
Abundant through the new-cut bed,  
Which by the running stream supplied  
With ocean's boundless waters vied.  
In dry and thirsty spots they sank  
Full many a well and ample tank,  
And altars round about them placed  
To deck the station in the waste.  
With well-wrought plaster smoothly spread,  
With bloomy trees that rose o'erhead,  
With banners waving in the air,  
And wild birds singing here and there,  
With fragrant sandal-water wet,  
With many a flower beside it set,  
Like the Gods' heavenly pathway showed  
That mighty host's imperial road.  
Deft workmen, chosen for their skill  
To do the high-souled Bharat's will,  
In every pleasant spot where grew  
Trees of sweet fruit and fair to view,  
As he commanded, toiled to grace  
With all delights his camping-place.  
And they who read the stars, and well  
Each lucky sign and hour could tell,  
Raised carefully the tented shade  
Wherein high-minded Bharat stayed.  
With ample space of level ground,  
With broad deep moat encompassed round;  
Like Mandar in his towering pride,  
With streets that ran from side to side;  
Enwreathed with many a palace tall  
Surrounded by its noble wall;  
With roads by skilful workmen made.  
Where many a glorious banner played;  
With stately mansions, where the dove  
Sat nestling in her cote above.  
Rising aloft supremely fair  
Like heavenly cars that float in air,  
Each camp in beauty and in bliss  
Matched Indra's own metropolis.  
  As shines the heaven on some fair night,  
   With moon and constellations filled.  
  The prince's royal road was bright,  
   Adorned by art of workmen skilled.

stanza the Bombay edition in preference to Schlegel's which gives the
tears of joy to the courtiers.
