### CANTO LV.: SÍTÁ IN PRISON.

Thus Rávan his commandment gave  
To those eight giants strong and brave,  
So thinking in his foolish pride  
Against all dangers to provide.  
Then with his wounded heart aflame  
With love he thought upon the dame,  
And took with hasty steps the way  

To the fair chamber where she lay,  
He saw the gentle lady there  
Weighed down by woe too great to bear,  
Amid the throng of fiends who kept  
Their watch around her as she wept:  
A pinnace sinking neath the wave  
When mighty winds around her rave:  
A lonely herd-forsaken deer,  
When hungry dogs are pressing near,  
Within the bower the giant passed:  
Her mournful looks were downward cast.  
As there she lay with streaming eyes  
The giant bade the lady rise,  
And to the shrinking captive showed  
The glories of his rich abode,  
Where thousand women spent their days  
In palaces with gold ablaze;  
Where wandered birds of every sort,  
And jewels flashed in hall and court.  
Where noble pillars charmed the sight  
With diamond and lazulite,  
And others glorious to behold  
With ivory, crystal, silver, gold.  
There swelled on high the tambour's sound,  
And burnished ore was bright around  
He led the mournful lady where  
Resplendent gold adorned the stair,  
And showed each lattice fair to see  
With silver work and ivory:  
Showed his bright chambers, line on line,  
Adorned with nets of golden twine.  
Beyond he showed the Maithil dame  
His gardens bright as lightning's flame,  
And many a pool and lake he showed  
Where blooms of gayest colour glowed.  
Through all his home from view to view  
The lady sunk in grief he drew.  
Then trusting in her heart to wake  
Desire of all she saw, he spake:  
'Three hundred million giants, all  
Obedient to their master's call,  
Not counting young and weak and old,  
Serve me with spirits fierce and bold.  
A thousand culled from all of these  
Wait on the lord they long to please.  
This glorious power, this pomp and sway,  
Dear lady, at thy feet I lay:  
Yea, with my life I give the whole,  
O dearer than my life and soul.  
A thousand beauties fill my hall:  
Be thou my wife and rule them all.  
O hear my supplication! why  
This reasonable prayer deny?  
Some pity to thy suitor show,  
For love's hot flames within me glow.  
This isle a hundred leagues in length,  
Encompassed by the ocean's strength,  
Would all the Gods and fiends defy  
Though led by Him who rules the sky.  
No God in heaven, no sage on earth,  
No minstrel of celestial birth,  

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>  

No spirit in the worlds I see  
A match in power and might for me.  
What wilt tbou do with Ráma, him  
Whose days are short, whose light is dim,  
Expelled from home and royal sway,  
Who treads on foot his weary way?  
Leave the poor mortal to his fate.  
And wed thee with a worthier mate.  
My timid love, enjoy with me  
The prime of youth before it flee.  
Do not one hour the hope retain  
To look on Ráma's face again.  
For whom would wildest thought beguile  
To seek thee in the giants' isle?  
Say who is he has power to bind  
In toils of net the rushing wind.  
Whose is the mighty hand will tame  
And hold the glory of the flame?  
In all the worlds above, below.  
Not one, O fair of form, I know  
Who from this isle in fight could rend  
The lady whom these arms defend.  
Fair Queen, o'er Lanka's island reign,  
Sole mistress of the wide domain.  
Gods, rovers of the night like me,  
And all the world thy slaves will be.  
O'er thy fair brows and queenly head  
Let conscerating balm be shed,  
And sorrow banished from thy breast,  
Enjoy my love and take thy rest.  
Here never more thy soul shall know  
The memory of thy former woe,  
And here shall thou enjoy the meed  
Deserved by every virtuous deed.  
Here garlands glow of flowery twine,  
With gorgeous hues and scent divine.  
Take gold and gems and rich attire:  
Enjoy with me thy heart's desire.  
There stand, of chariots far the best,  
The car my brother once possessed.  
Which, victor in the stricken field,  
I forced the Lord of Gold to yield.  
'Tis wide and high and nobly wrought,  
Bright as the sun and swift as thought.  
Therein O Sítá, shalt tbou ride  
Delighted by thy lover's side.  
But sorrow mars with lingering trace  
The splendour of thy lotus face.  
A cloud of woe is o'er it spread,  
And all the light of joy is fled.'  
   The lady, by her woe distressed,  
One corner of her raiment pressed  
To her sad cheek like moonlight clear.  
And wiped away a falling tear.  
The rover of the night renewed  
His eager pleading as he viewed  
The lady stand like one distraught,  
Striving to fix her wandering thought:  
' Think not, sweet Lady, of the shame  
Of broken vows, nor fear the blame.  
The Saints approve with favouring eyes  

This union knit with marriage ties.  
O beauty, at thy radiant feet  
I lay my heads, and thus entreat.  
One word of grace, one look I crave:  
Have pity on thy prostrate slave.  
These idle words I speak are vain,  
Wrung forth by love's consuming pain,  
And ne'er of Rávan be it said  
He wooed a dame with prostrate head.'  
Thus to the Maithil lady sued  
The monarch of the giant brood,  
And 'She is now mine own,' he thought,  
In Death's dire coils already caught.
