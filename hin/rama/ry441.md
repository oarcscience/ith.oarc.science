### CANTO XLII.: THE SALLY.

Still was the cry,'The Vánar foes  
Around the leaguered city close.'  
King Rávan from the terrace gazed  
And saw, with eyes where fury blazed,  
The Vánar host in serried ranks  
Press to the moat and line the banks,  
And, first in splendour and in place,  
The lion lord of Raghu's race.  
And Ráma looked on Lanká where  
Gay flags were streaming to the air,  
And, while keen sorrow pierced him through,  
His loving thoughts to Sitá flew:  
'There, there in deep affliction lies  
My darling with the fawn-like eyes.  
There on the cold bare ground she keeps  
Sad vigil and for Ráma weeps.'  
Mad with the thought, 'Charge, charge,' he cried.  
'Let earth with Rákshas blood be dyed.'  
   
Responsive to his call rang out  
A loud, a universal shout,  
As myriads filled the moat with stone,  
Trees, rocks, and mountains overthrown,  
And charging at their leader's call  
Pressed forward furious to the wall.  
Some in their headlong ardour scaled  
The rampart's height, the guard assailed,  
And many a ponderous fragment rent  
From portal, tower, and battlement.  
Huge gates adorned with burnished gold  
Were loosed and lifted from their hold;  
And post and pillar, with a sound  
Like thunder, fell upon the ground.  
At every portal, east and west  
And north and south, the chieftains pressed  
Each in his post appointed led  
His myriads in the forest bred.  

'Charge, let the gates be opened wide:  
'Charge, charge, my giants,' Rávan cried.  
They heard his voice, and loud and long  
Rang the wild clamour of the throng,  
And shell and drum their notes upsent,  
And every martial instrument.  
Forth, at the bidding of their lord  
From every gate the giants poured,  
As, when the waters rise and swell.  
Huge waves preceding waves impel.  

Again from every Vánar throat  
A scream of fierce defiance smote  
The welkin: earth and sea and sky  
Reëchoed with the awful cry.  
The roar of elephants, the neigh  
Of horses eager for the fray.  
The frequent clash of warriors' steel,  
The rattling of the chariot wheel.  
Fierce was the deadly fight: opposed  
In terrible array they closed,  
As when the Gods of heaven enraged  
With rebel fiends wild battle waged.  
Axe, spear, and mace were wielded well:  
At every blow a Vánar fell.  
But shivered rock and brandished tree  
Brought many a giant on his knee,  
To perish in his turn beneath  
The deadly wounds of nails and teeth.
