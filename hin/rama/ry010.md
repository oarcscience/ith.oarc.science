### CANTO VIII.: SUMANTRA'S SPEECH.

But splendid, just, and great of mind,  
The childless king for offspring pined.  
No son had he his name to grace,  
Transmitter of his royal race.  
Long had his anxious bosom wrought,  
And as he pondered rose the thought:  
'A votive steed 'twere good to slay,  
So might a son the gift repay.'  
Before his lords his plan he laid,  
And bade them with their wisdom aid:  
Then with these words Sumantra, best  
Of royal counsellors, addressed:  
'Hither, Vas'ishtha at their head,  
Let all my priestly guides be led.'  
To him Sumantra made reply:  
'Hear, Sire, a tale of days gone by.  
To many a sage in time of old,  
Sanatkumár, the saint, foretold  
How from thine ancient line, O King,  
A son, when years came round, should spring.  
'Here dwells,' 'twas thus the seer began,  
'Of Kas'yap's  <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md) race, a holy man,  
Vibhándak named: to him shall spring  
A son, the famous Rishyas'ring.  
Bred with the deer that round him roam,  
The wood shall be that hermit's home.  

To him no mortal shall be known  
Except his holy sire alone.  
Still by those laws shall he abide  
Which lives of youthful Bráhmans guide,  
Obedient to the strictest rule  
That forms the young ascetic's school:  
And all the wondering world shall hear  
Of his stern life and penance drear;  
His care to nurse the holy fire  
And do the bidding of his sire.  
Then, seated on the Angas'  <span id="fr_80"></span>[1b](#fn_80.md)
throne,  
Shall Lomapád to fame be known.  
But folly wrought by that great king  
A plague upon the land shall bring;  
No rain for many a year shall fall  
And grievous drought shall ruin all.  
The troubled king with many a prayer  
Shall bid the priests some cure declare:  
'The lore of Heaven 'tis yours to know,  
Nor are ye blind to things below:  
Declare, O holy men, the way  
This plague to expiate and stay.'  
Those best of Bráhmans shall reply:  
'By every art, O Monarch, try  
Hither to bring Vibhándak's child,  
Persuaded, captured, or beguiled.  
And when the boy is hither led  
To him thy daughter duly wed.'  

But how to bring that wondrous boy  
His troubled thoughts will long employ,  
And hopeless to achieve the task  
He counsel of his lords will ask,  
And bid his priests and servants bring  
With honour saintly Rishyas'ring.  
But when they hear the monarch's speech,  
All these their master will beseech,  
With trembling hearts and looks of woe,  
To spare them, for they fear to go.  
And many a plan will they declare  
   And crafty plots will frame,  
And promise fair to show him there,  
   Unforced, with none to blame.  
On every word his lords shall say,  
   The king will meditate,  
And on the third returning day  
   Recall them to debate.  
Then this shall be the plan agreed,  
   That damsels shall be sent  
Attired in holy hermits' weed,  
   And skilled in blandishment,  
That they the hermit may beguile  
With every art and amorous wile  

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>  

   Whose use they know so well,  
And by their witcheries seduce  
The unsuspecting young recluse  
   To leave his father's cell.  
Then when the boy with willing feet  
Shall wander from his calm retreat  
   And in that city stand,  
The troubles of the king shall end,  
And streams of blessed rain descend  
   Upon the thirsty land.  
Thus shall the holy Rishyas'ring  
To Lomapád, the mighty king,  
   By wedlock be allied;  
For S'ántá, fairest of the fair,  
In mind and grace beyond compare,  
   Shall be his royal bride.  
He, at the Offering of the Steed,  
The flames with holy oil shall feed,  
And for King Das'aratha gain  
Sons whom his prayers have begged in vain.'  
'I have repeated, Sire, thus far,  
The words of old Sanatkumár,  
In order as he spoke them then  
Amid the crowd of holy men.'  
Then Das'aratha cried with joy,  
'Say how they brought the hermit boy.'
