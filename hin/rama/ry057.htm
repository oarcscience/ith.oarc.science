<P>
Then with his heart consumed with woe,<BR>
Still brooding on his overthrow<BR>
By the great saint he had defied,<BR>
At every breath the monarch sighed.<BR>
Forth from his home his queen he led,<BR>
And to a land far southward fled.<BR>
There, fruit and roots his only food,<BR>
He practised penance, sense-subdued,<BR>
And in that solitary spot<BR>
Four virtuous sons the king begot:<BR>
Havishyand, from the offering named,<BR>
And Madhushyand, for sweetness famed,<BR>
Mah&aacute;rath, chariot-borne in fight,<BR>
And Dridhanetra strong of sight.<BR>

<P>
A thousand years had passed away,<BR>
When Brahm&aacute;, Sire whom all obey,<BR>
Addressed in pleasant words like these<BR>
Him rich in long austerities:<BR>
'Thou by the penance, Kus'ik's son,<BR>
A place 'mid royal saints hast won.<BR>
Pleased with thy constant penance, we<BR>
This lofty rank assign to thee.'<BR>

<P>
Thus spoke the glorious Lord most High<BR>
Father of earth and air and sky,<BR>
And with the Gods around him spread<BR>
Home to his changeless sphere he sped.<BR>
But Vis'v&aacute;mitra scorned the grace,<BR>
And bent in shame his angry face.<BR>
Burning with rage, o'erwhelmed with grief,<BR>
Thus in his heart exclaimed the chief:<BR>
'No fruit, I ween, have I secured<BR>
By strictest penance long endured,<BR>
If Gods and all the saints decree<BR>
To make but royal saint of me.'<BR>
Thus pondering, he with sense subdued,<BR>
With sternest zeal his vows renewed.<BR>

Then reigned a monarch, true of soul,<BR>
Who kept each sense in firm control;<BR>
Of old Ikshv&aacute;ku's line he came,<BR>
That glories in Tris'anku's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> name.<BR>
Within his breast, O Raghu's child,<BR>
Arose a longing, strong and wild,<BR>
Great offerings to the Gods to pay,<BR>
And win, alive, to heaven his way.<BR>
His priest Vas'ishtha's aid he sought,<BR>
And told him of his secret thought.<BR>
But wise Vas'ishtha showed the hope<BR>
Was far beyond the monarch's scope.<BR>
Tris'anku then, his suit denied,<BR>
Far to the southern region hied,<BR>
To beg Vas'ishtha's sons to aid<BR>
The mighty plan his soul had made.<BR>
There King Tris'anku, far renowned,<BR>
Vas'ishtha's hundred children found,<BR>
Each on his fervent vows intent,<BR>
For mind and fame pre&euml;minent.<BR>
To these the famous king applied,<BR>
Wise children of his holy guide.<BR>
Saluting each in order due.<BR>
His eyes, for shame, he downward threw,<BR>
And reverent hands together pressed,<BR>
The glorious company addressed:<BR>
'I as a humble suppliant seek<BR>
Succour of you who aid the weak.<BR>
A mighty offering I would pay,<BR>
But sage Vas'ishtna answered, Nay.<BR>
Be yours permission to accord,<BR>
And to my rites your help afford.<BR>
Sons of my guide, to each of you<BR>
With lowly reverence here I sue;<BR>
To each, intent on penance-vow,<BR>
O Br&aacute;hmans, low my head I bow,<BR>
And pray you each with ready heart<BR>
In my great rite to bear a part,<BR>
That in the body I may rise<BR>
And dwell with Gods within the skies.<BR>
Sons of rny guide, none else I see<BR>
Can give what he refuses me.<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's children still depend<BR>
Upon their guide most reverend;<BR>
And you, as nearest in degree<BR>
To him, my deities shall be!'<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_234"></A><A HREF="ry057.htm#fr_234">69:1</A>  'Tris'anku, king of Ayodhy&aacute;, was
seventh in descent from Ikshv&aacute;ku. and
Das'aratha holds the thirty-fourth place
in the same genealogv. See Canto LXX.
We are thrown back, therefore, to very
ancient times, and it occasions some surprise
to find Vas'ishtha and Vis'v&aacute;mitra,
actors in these occurences, still alive in
R&aacute;ma's time.'</P>
