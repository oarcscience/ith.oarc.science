<P>
When Sagar thus had bowed to fate,<BR>
The lords and commons of the state<BR>
Approved with ready heart and will<BR>
Prince Ans'um&aacute;n his throne to fill.<BR>
He ruled, a mighty king, unblamed,<BR>
Sire of Dil&iacute;pa justly famed.<BR>
To him. his child and worthy heir,<BR>
The king resigned his kingdom's care,<BR>
And on Him&aacute;laya's pleasant side<BR>
His task austere of penance plied.<BR>
Bright as a God in clear renown<BR>
He planned to bring pure Gang&aacute; down.<BR>
There on his fruitless hope intent<BR>
Twice sixteen thousand years he spent,<BR>
And in the grove of hermits stayed<BR>
Till bliss in heaven his rites repaid.<BR>
Dil&iacute;pa then, the good and great,<BR>
Soon as he learnt his kinsmen's fate,<BR>
Bowed down by woe, with troubled mind,<BR>

<P>
Pondering long no cure could find.<BR>
'How can I bring,' the mourner sighed,<BR>
'To cleanse their dust, the heavenly tide?<BR>
How can I give them rest, and save<BR>
Their spirits with the offered wave?'<BR>
Long with this thought his bosom skilled<BR>
In holy discipline was filled.<BR>
A son was born, Bhagirath named,<BR>
Above all men for virtue famed.<BR>
Dilipa many a rite ordained,<BR>
And thirty thousand seasons reigned.<BR>
But when no hope the king could see<BR>
His kinsmen from their woe to free,<BR>
The lord of men, by sickness tried,<BR>
Obeyed the law of fate, and died;<BR>
He left the kingdom to his son,<BR>
And gained the heaven his deeds had won.<BR>
The good Bhagirath, royal sage.<BR>
Had no fair son to cheer his age.<BR>
He, great in glory, pure in will,<BR>
Longing for sons was childless still.<BR>
Then on one wish, one thought intent,<BR>
Planning the heavenly stream's descent,<BR>
Leaving his ministers the care<BR>
And burden of his state to bear,<BR>
Dwelling in far Gokarna &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_194"></A><A HREF="#fn_194"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> he<BR>
Engaged in long austerity.<BR>
With senses checked, with arms upraised,<BR>
Five fires &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> around and o'er him blazed.<BR>
Each weary month the hermit passed<BR>
Breaking but once his awful fast.<BR>
In winter's chill the brook his bed,<BR>
In rain, the clouds to screen his head.<BR>
Thousands of years he thus endured<BR>
Till Brahm&aacute;'s favour was assured,<BR>
And the high Lord of living things<BR>
Looked kindly on his sufferings.<BR>
With trooping Gods the Sire came near<BR>
The king who plied his task austere:<BR>
'Blest Monarch, of a glorious race,<BR>
Thy fervent rites have won my grace.<BR>
Well hast thou wrought thine awful task:<BR>
Some boon in turn, O Hermit, ask.'<BR>

<P>
Bhagirath, rich in glory's light,<BR>
The hero with the arm of might,<BR>
Thus to the Lord of earth and sky<BR>
Raised suppliant hands and made reply:<BR>
'If the great God his favour deigns,<BR>
And my long toil its fruit obtains,<BR>
Let Sagar's sons receive from me<BR>
Libations that they long to see.<BR>
Let Gang&aacute; with her holy wave<BR>
The ashes of the heroes lave,<BR>
That so my kinsmen may ascend<BR>
To heavenly bliss that ne'er shall end.<BR>
And give, I pray, O God, a son,<BR>
Nor let my house be all undone.<BR>


<P>

<P>


<P>
Sire of the worlds! be this the grace<BR>
Bestowed upon Ikshv&aacute;ku's race.'<BR>

<P>
The Sire, when thus the king had prayed,<BR>
In sweet kind words his answer made.<BR>
'High, high thy thought and wishes are,<BR>
Bhagirath of the mighty car!<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's line is blest in thee,<BR>
And as thou prayest it shall be.<BR>
Gang&aacute;, whose waves in Swarga &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="ry044.htm#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> flow,<BR>
Is daughter of the Lord of Snow.<BR>
Win S'iva that his aid be lent<BR>
To hold her in her mid descent,<BR>
For earth alone will never bear<BR>
Those torrents hurled from upper air;<BR>
And none may hold her weight but He,<BR>
The Trident wielding deity.'<BR>
Thus having said, the Lord supreme<BR>
Addressed him to the heavenly stream;<BR>
And then with Gods and Maruts &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_197"></A><A HREF="ry044.htm#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> went<BR>
To heaven above the firmament.<BR>
