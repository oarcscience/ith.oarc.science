'With this and many a speech beside.<BR>
My failing heart he fortified,<BR>

<P>

<P>
With glorious hope my breast inspired,<BR>
And to his holy home retired.<BR>
I scaled the mountain height, to view<BR>
The region round, and looked for you.<BR>
In ceaseless watchings night and day<BR>
A hundred seasons passed away,<BR>
And by the sage's words consoled<BR>
I wait the hour and chance foretold.<BR>
But since Nis'&aacute;kar sought the skies.<BR>
And cast away all earthly ties,<BR>
Full many a care and doubt has pressed<BR>
With grievous weight upon my breast.<BR>
But for the saint who turned aside<BR>
My purpose I had surely died.<BR>
Those hopeful words the hermit spake,<BR>
That bid me live for R&aacute;ma's sake,<BR>
Dispel my anguish as the light<BR>
Of lamp and torch disperse the night.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: and in the V&aacute;nars' view<BR>
Forth from his side young pinions grew,<BR>
And boundless rapture filled his breast<BR>
As thus the chieftains he addressed:<BR>
'Joy, joy! the pinions, which the Lord<BR>
Of Day consumed, are now restored<BR>
Through the dear grace & boundless might<BR>
Of that illustrious anchorite.<BR>
The tire of youth within me burns,<BR>
And all my wonted strength returns.<BR>
Onward, ye V&aacute;nars, toil strive,<BR>
And you shall find the dame alive.<BR>
Look on these new-found wings, and hence<BR>
Be strong in surest confidence.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Swift from the crag he sprang to try<BR>
His pinions in his nativie sky.<BR>
His words the chieftains' doubts had stilled?<BR>
And every heart with courage filled.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_780"></A><A HREF="ry339.htm#fn_780"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
