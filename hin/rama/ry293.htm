<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XIX.: T&Aacute;R&Aacute;'S GRIEF.</H3>
<P>
No answer gave the V&aacute;nar king<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's prudent counselling.<BR>
Battered and bruised by tree and stone,<BR>
By R&aacute;ma's arrow overthrown,<BR>
Fainting upon the ground he lay,<BR>
Gasping his troubled life away.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But T&aacute;r&aacute; in the V&aacute;nar's hall<BR>
Heard tidings of her husband's fall;<BR>
Heard that a shaft from R&aacute;ma's bow<BR>
Had laid the royal B&aacute;li low.<BR>
Her darling Angad by her side,<BR>
Distracted from her home she hied.<BR>
Then nigh the place of battle drew<BR>
The V&aacute;nars, Angad's retinue.<BR>
They saw the bow-armed R&aacute;ma: dread<BR>
Fell on them, and they turned and fled.<BR>
Like helpless deer, their leaders slain,<BR>
So wildly fled the startled train.<BR>
But T&aacute;r&aacute; saw, and nearer pressed.<BR>
And thus the flying band addressed:<BR>
'O V&aacute;nars, ye who ever stand<BR>
About our king, a trusty band,<BR>
Where is the lion master? why<BR>
Forsake ye thus your lord and fly?<BR>
Say, lies he dead upon the plain,<BR>
A brother by a brother slain,<BR>
Or pierced by shafts from R&aacute;ma's bow<BR>
That rain from far upon the foe?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus T&aacute;r&aacute; questioned, and was still:<BR>
Then, wearers of each shape at will,<BR>
The V&aacute;nars thus with one accord<BR>
Answered the Lady of their lord:<BR>
'Turn, T&aacute;r&aacute; turn, and half undone<BR>
Save Angad thy beloved son.<BR>
Tnere R&aacute;ma stands in death's disguise,<BR>
And conquered B&aacute;li faints and dies.<BR>
He by whose strong arm, thick and fast,<BR>
Uprooted trees and rocks were cast,<BR>
Lies smitten by a shaft that came<BR>
Resistless as the lightning flame.<BR>
When he, whose splendour once could vie<BR>
With Indra's, regent of the sky,<BR>
Fell by that deadly arrow, all<BR>
The V&aacute;nars fled who marked his fall.<BR>
Let all our chiefs their succours bring,<BR>
And Angad be anointed king:<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_349"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 349</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
For all who come of V&aacute;nar race<BR>
Will serve him set in B&aacute;li's place.<BR>
Or else our conquering foes to-day<BR>
Within our wall will force their way,<BR>
Polluting with their hostile feet<BR>
The chambers of thy loved retreat.<BR>
Great fear is on us. all and one.<BR>
Those who have wives and who have none,<BR>
They lust for power, are fierce and bold,<BR>
Or hate us for the strife of old.'<BR>

<P>
She heard their speech as, sore afraid,<BR>
Arrested in their flight, they stayed,<BR>
And gave her answer as became<BR>
Tne spirit of so true a dame:<BR>
'Nay, what have I to do with pelf,<BR>
With son, with kingdom, or with self,<BR>
When he, my noble lord, who leads<BR>
The V&aacute;nars 'like a loin, bleeds?<BR>
His high-souled victor will I meet,<BR>
And throw me prostrate at his feet.'<BR>
She hastened forth, her bosom rent<BR>
With anguish, weeping as she went,<BR>
And striking, mastered by her woes,<BR>
Her head and breast with frantic blows.<BR>
She hurried to the field and found<BR>
Her husband postrate on the ground,<BR>
Who quelled the hostile V&aacute;nars' might,<BR>
Whose bank was never turned in flight:<BR>
Whose arm a massy rock could throw<BR>
As Indra hurls his bolts below:<BR>
Fierce as the rushing tempest, loud<BR>
As thunder from a labouring cloud:<BR>
Whene'er he roared his voice of fear<BR>
Struck terror on the boldest ear:<BR>
Now slain, as, hungry for the prey,<BR>
A tiger might a lion slay:<BR>
Or when, his serpent foe to seek,<BR>
Suparna&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_601"></A><A HREF="#fn_601"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with his furious beak<BR>
Tears up a sacred hillock, long<BR>
The reverence of a village throng,<BR>
Its altar with their offerings spread,<BR>
And the gay flag that waved o erhead.<BR>
She looked and saw the victor stand<BR>
Renting upon his bow his hand:<BR>
And fierce Sugriva she descried,<BR>
And Lakshman by his brother's side,<BR>
She passed them by, nor stayed to view,<BR>
Swift to her husband's side she flew;<BR>
Then as she looked, her strength gave way.<BR>
And in the dust she fell and lay.<BR>
Then, as if startled ere the close<BR>
Of slumber, from the earth she rose.<BR>
Upon her dying husband, round<BR>
Whose soul the coils of Death were wound,<BR>
Her eyes in agony she bent<BR>
And called him with a shrill lament.<BR>
Sugriva, when he heard her cries,<BR>
Aud saw the queen with weeping eyes,<BR>

<P>

<P>
And youthful Angad standing there,<BR>
His load of grief could hardly bear.<BR>
