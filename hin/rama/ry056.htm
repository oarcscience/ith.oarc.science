<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LVI.: VIS'V&Aacute;MITRA'S VOW.</H3>
<P>
But Vis'v&aacute;mitra, at the threat<BR>
Of that illustrious anchoret,<BR>
Cried, as he launched with ready hand<BR>
A fiery weapon, 'Stand, O Stand!'<BR>
Vas'ishtha, wild with rage and hate,<BR>
Raising, as 'twere the Rod of Fate,<BR>
His mighty Br&aacute;hman wand on high,<BR>
To Vis'v&aacute;mitra made reply:<BR>
'Nay, stand. O Warrior thou, and show<BR>
What soldier can, 'gainst Br&aacute;hman foe.<BR>
O G&aacute;dhi's son, thy days are told;<BR>
Thy pride is tamed, thy dart is cold.<BR>
How shall a warrior's puissance dare<BR>
With Br&aacute;hman's awful strength compare?<BR>
To-day, base Warrior, shall thou feel<BR>
That God-sent might is more than steel.'<BR>
He raised his Br&aacute;hman staff, nor missed<BR>
The fiery dart that near him hissed:<BR>
And quenched the fearful weapon fell,<BR>
As flame beneath the billow's swell.<BR>

<P>
Then G&aacute;dhi's son in fury threw<BR>
Lord Varun's arm and Rudra's too:<BR>
Indra's fierce bolt that all destroys;<BR>
That which the Lord of Herds employs:<BR>
The Human, that which minstrels Keep,<BR>
The deadly Lure, the endless Sleep:<BR>
The Yawner, and the dart which charms;<BR>
Lament and Torture, fearful arms:<BR>
The Terrible, the dart which dries,<BR>
The Thunderbolt which quenchless flies,<BR>
And Fate's dread net, and Brahm&aacute;'s noose,<BR>
And that which waits for Varun's use:<BR>
The dart he loves who wields the bow<BR>
Pin&aacute;ka, and twin bolts that glow<BR>
With fury as they flash and fly,<BR>
The quenchless Liquid and the Dry:<BR>
The dart of Vengeance, swift to kill:<BR>
The Goblins' dart, the Curlew's Bill:<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The discus both of Fate and Right,<BR>
And Vishnu's, of unerring flight:<BR>
The Wind-God's dart, the Troubler dread,<BR>
The weapon named the Horse's Head.<BR>
From his fierce hand two spears were thrown,<BR>
And the great mace that smashes bone;<BR>
The dart of spirits of the air,<BR>
And that which Fate exults to bear;<BR>
The Trident dart which slaughters foes,<BR>
And that which hanging skulls compose:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
These fearful darts in fiery rain<BR>
He hurled upon the saint amain,<BR>
An awful miracle to view.<BR>
But as the ceaseless tempest flew,<BR>
The sage with wand of God-sent power<BR>
Still swallowed up that fiery shower.<BR>

<P>
Then G&aacute;dhi's son, when these had failed,<BR>
With Brahm&aacute;'s dart his foe assailed.<BR>
The Gods, with Indra at their head,<BR>
And N&aacute;gas, quailed disquieted,<BR>
And saints and minstrels, when they saw<BR>
The king that awful weapon draw;<BR>
And the three worlds were filled with dread,<BR>
And trembled as the missile sped.<BR>

<P>
The saint, with Br&aacute;hman wand, empowered<BR>
By lore divine that dart devoured.<BR>
Nor could the triple world withdraw<BR>
Rapt gazes from that sight of awe;<BR>
For as be swallowed down the dart<BR>
Of Brahm&aacute;, sparks from every part,<BR>
From finest pore and hair-cell, broke<BR>
Enveloped in a veil of smoke.<BR>
The staff he waved was all aglow<BR>
Like Y&aacute;ma's sceptre, King below,<BR>
Or like the lurid fire of Fate<BR>
Whose rage the worlds will desolate.<BR>

<P>
The hermits, whom that sight had awed,<BR>
Extolled the saint, with hymn and laud:<BR>
'Thy power, O Sage, is ne'er in vain:<BR>
Now with thy might thy might restrain.<BR>
Be gracious, Master, and allow<BR>

<P>

<P>
The worlds to rest from trouble now;<BR>
For Vis'v&aacute;mitra, strong and dread,<BR>
By thee has been discomfited.'<BR>

<P>
Then, thus addressed, the saint, well pleased.<BR>
The fury of his wrath appeased.<BR>
The king, o'erpowered and ashamed,<BR>
With many a deep-drawn sigh exclaimed:<BR>
'Ah! Warriors' strength is poor and slight;<BR>
A Br&aacute;hman's power is truly might.<BR>
This Br&aacute;hman staff the hermit held<BR>
The fury of my darts has quelled.<BR>
This truth within my heart impressed,<BR>
With senses ruled and tranquil breast<BR>
My task austere will I begin,<BR>
And Br&aacute;hmanhood will strive to win.'<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_233"></A><A HREF="ry056.htm#fr_233">68:1</A>  'The names of many of these weapons
which are mythical and partly allegorical
have occurred in Canto XXIX. The general
signification of the story is clear enough.
It is a contest for supremacy between the
regal or military order and Br&aacute;hmanical
or priestly authority, like one of those
struggles which our own Europe saw in
the middle ages when without employing
warlike weapons the priesthood frequently
gained the victory.' SCHLEGEL.
