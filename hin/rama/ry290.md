### CANTO XVI.: THE FALL OF BÁLI.

Thus Tárá with the starry eyes  <span id="fr_582"></span>[1b](#fn_582)  
Her counsel gave with burning sighs.  
But Báli, by her prayers unmoved,  
Spurned her advice, and thus reproved:  
'How may this insult, scathe, aud scorn  
By me, dear love, be tamely born?  
My brother, yea my foe, comes nigh  
Aud dares me forth with shout and cry.  
Learn, trembler! that the valiant, they  
Who yield no step in battle fray,  
Will die a thousand deaths but ne'er  
An unavenged dishonour bear.  
Nor, O my love, be thou dismayed  
Though Ráma lend Sugríva aid,  
For one so pure and duteous, one  
Who loves the right, all sin will shun,  
Release me from thy soft embrace,  
And with thy dames thy steps retrace:  
Enough already, O mine own,  
Of love and sweet devotion shown.  
Drive all thy fear and doubt away;  
I seek Sugríva in the fray  
His boisterous rage and pride to still,  
And tame the foe I would not kill.  
My fury, armed with brandished trees,  
Shall strike Sugríva to his knees:  

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>  

Nor shall the humbled foe withstand  
The blows of my avenging hand,  
When, nerved by rage and pride, I beat  
The traitor down beneath my feet.  
Thou, love, hast lent thine own sweet aid,  
And all thy tender care displayed;  
Now by my life, by these who yearn  
To serve thee well, I pray thee turn.  
But for a while, dear dame, I go  
To come triumphant o'er the foe.'  
   Thus Báh spake in gentlest tone:  
Soft arms about his neck were thrown;  
Then round her lord the lady went  
With sad steps slow and reverent.  
She stood in solemn guise to bless  
With prayers for safety and success,  
Then with her train her chamber sought  
By grief and racking fear distraught.  
   With serpent's pantings fierce and fast  
King Báli from the city passed.  
His glance, as each quick breath he drew,  
Around to find the foe he threw,  
And saw where fierce Sugríva showed  
His form with golden hues that glowed,  
And, as a fire resplendent, stayed  
To meet his foe in arms arrayed.  
When Báli, long-armed chieftain, found  
Sugríva stationed on the ground,  
Impelled by warlike rage he braced  
His warrior garb about his waist,  
And with his mighty arm raised high  
Rushed at Sugríva with a cry.  
But when Sugríva, fierce and bold,  
Saw Báli with his chain of gold.  
His arm he heaved, his hand he closed,  
And face to face his foe opposed.  
To him whose eyes with fury shone,  
In charge imtpetuous rushing on,  
Skilled in each warlike art and plan,  
Báli with hasty words began:  
'My ponderous hood, to fight addressed.  
With fingers clenched and arm compressed.  
Shall on thy death doomed brow descend  
And, crashing down, thy life shall end.'  
He spoke; and wild with rage and pride,  
The fierce Sagríva thus replied:  
'Thus let my arm begin the strife  
And from thy body crush the life.'  
   Then Báli, wounded aud enraged,  
With furious blows the battle waged.  
Sugríva seemed, with blood-streams dyed,  
A hill with fountains in his side.  
But with his native force unspent  
A Sál tree from the earth he rent,  
And like the bolt of Indra smote  
On Báli's head and chest and throat.  
Bruised by the blows he could not shield,  
Half vanquished Báli sank and reeled,  
As sinks a vessel with her freight  
Borne down by overwhelming weight.  

Swift as Suparna's  <span id="fr_583"></span>[1](ry291.htm#fn_583)
swiftest flight  
In awful strength they rushed to fight:  
So might the sun and moon on high  
Encountering battle in the sky.  
Fierce and more fierce, as fought the foes,  
The furious rage of combat rose.  
They warred with feet and arms and knees,  
With nails and stones and boughs and trees,  
And blows descending fast as rain  
Dyed each dark form with crimson stain,  
While like two thunder-clouds they met  
With battle-cry and shout and threat.  
Then Ráma saw Sugríva quail,  
Marked his worn strength grow weak and fail.  
Saw how he turned his wistful eye  
To every quarter of the sky.  
His friend's defeat he could not brook.  
Bent on his shaft an eager look,  
Then burned to slay the conquering foe,  
And laid his arrow on the bow.  
As to an orb the bow he drew  
Forth from the string the arrow flew  
Like Fate's tremendous discus hurled  
By Yama  <span id="fr_584"></span>[2](ry291.htm#fn_584) forth to end the
world.  
So loud the din that every bird  
The bow-string's clans with terror heard,  
And wildly fled the affrighted deer  
As though the day of doom were near,  
So, deadly as the serpent's fang,  
Forth from the string the arrow sprang.  
Like the red lightning's flash and flame  
It flew unerring to its aim,  
And, hissing murder through the air,  
Pierced Báli's breast, and quivered there.  
Struck by the shaft that flew so well  
The mighty Vánar reeled and fell,  
As earthward Indra's flag they pull  
When As'víní's fair moon is full  <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_582"></span>[342:1b](ry290.htm#fr_582) Tárá means 'star'.
The poet plays upon the name by comparing her beauty to that of the Lord
of stars, the Moon.
