<P>
Then R&aacute;van spake with flashing eye:<BR>
'Hence with the V&aacute;nar: let him die.<BR>
Vib&iacute;shan heard the stern behest,<BR>
And pondered in his troubled breast;<BR>
Then, trained in arts that soothe and please<BR>
Addressed the king in words like these:<BR>

<P>
'Revoke, my lord, thy fierce decree,<BR>
And hear the words I speak to thee.<BR>
Kings wise and noble ne'er condemn<BR>
To death the envoys sent to them:<BR>
Such deed the world's contempt would draw<BR>
On him who breaks the ancient law. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_892"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Observe the mean where justice lies,<BR>
And spare his life but still chastise.'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then forth the tyrant's fury broke,<BR>
And thus in angry words he spoke:<BR>
'O hero, when the wicked bleed<BR>
No sin or shame attends the deed.<BR>
The V&aacute;nar's blood must needs be spilt,<BR>
The penalty of heinous guilt.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Again Vibh&iacute;shan made reply:<BR>
'Nay, hear me, for he must not die.<BR>
Hear the great law the wise declare:<BR>
'Thy foeman's envoy thou shalt spare.'<BR>
'Tis true he comes an open foe:<BR>
'Tis true his hands have wrought us woe<BR>
But law allows thee, if thou wilt,<BR>
A punishment to suit the guilt.<BR>
The mark of shame, the scourge, the brand,<BR>
The shaven head, the wounded hand.<BR>
Yea, were the V&aacute;nar envoy slain,<BR>
Where, King of giants, were the gain?<BR>
On them alone, on them who sent<BR>
The message, be the punishment.<BR>
For spake he well or spake he ill,<BR>
He spake obedient to their will.<BR>
And, if he perish, who can bear<BR>
Thy challenge to the royal pair?<BR>
Who, cross the ocean and incite<BR>
Thy death-doomed enemies to fight?'<BR>
