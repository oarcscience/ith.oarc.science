### CANTO XLVIII.: SITÁ'S LAMENT.

'False are they all, proved false to-day,  
The prophets of my fortune, they  
Who in the tranquil time of old  
A blessed life for me foretold,  
Predicting I should never know  
A childless dame's, a widow's woe,  
False are they all, their words are vain.  
For thou, my lord and life, art slain.  
False was the priest and vain his lore  
Who blessed me in those days of yore  
By Ráma's side in bliss to reign:  
For thou, my lord and life, art slain.  
They hailed me happy from my birth,  
Proud empress of the lord of earth.  
They blessed me--but the thought is pain--  
For thou, my lord and life, art slain.  
Ah, fruitless hope! each glorious sign  
That stamps the future queen is mine,  
With no ill-omened mark to show  
A widow's crushing hour of woe.  
They say my hair is black and fine,  
They praise my brows' continuous line;  
My even teeth divided well.  
My bosom for its graceful swell.  
They praise my feet and fingers oft;  
They say my skin is smooth and soft,  
And call me happy to possess  
The twelve fair marks that bring success.  <span
id="fr_965"></span>[1](#fn_965.md)  
But ah, what profit shall I gain?  
Thou, O my lord and life, art slain.  
The flattering seer in former days  
My gentle girlish smile would praise,  

<span id="page_463">p. 463</span>  

And swear that holy water shed  
By Bráhman hands upon my head  
Should make me queen, a monarch's bride:  
How is the promise verified?  
Matchless in might the brothers slew  
In Janasthán the giant crew,  
And forced the indomitable sea  
To let them pass to rescue me.  
Theirs was the fiery weapon hurled  
By him who rules the watery world;  <span
id="fr_966"></span>[1](#fn_966.md)  
Theirs the dire shaft by Indra sped;  
Theirs was the mystic Brahmá's Head.  <span
id="fr_967"></span>[2](#fn_967.md)  
In vain they fought, the bold and brave:  
A coward's hand their death-wounds gave.  
By secret shafts and magic spell  
The brothers, peers of Indra, fell.  
That foe, if seen by Ráma's eye  
One moment, had not lived to fly.  
Though swift as thought, his utmost speed  
Had failed him in the hour of need.  
No might, no tear, no prayer may stay  
Fate's dark inevitable day.  
Nor could their matchless valour shield  
These heroes on the battle field.  
I sorrow for the noble dead,  
I mourn my hopes for ever fled;  
But chief my weeping eyes o'erflow  
For Queen Kaus'alyá's hopeless woe.  
The widowed queen is counting now  
Each hour prescribed by Ráma's vow,  
And lives because she longs to see  
Once more her princely sons and me.'  

Then Trijatá,  <span id="fr_968"></span>[3](#fn_968.md) of gentler mould  
Though Rákshas born, her grief consoled:  
'Dear Queen, thy causeless woe dispel:  
Thy husband lives, and all is well.  
Look round: in every Vánar face  
The light of joyful hope I trace.  
Not thus, believe me, shine the eyes  
Of warriors when their leader dies.  
An Army, when the chief is dead,  
Flies from the field dispirited.  
Here, undisturbed in firm array,  
The Vánars by the brothers stay.  
Love prompts my speech; no longer grieve;  
Ponder my counsel, and believe.  
These lips of mine from earliest youth  
Have spoken, and shall speak, the truth.  
Deep in my heart thy gentle grace  
And patient virtues hold their place.  
Turn, lady, turn once more thine eye:  
Though pierced with shafts the heroes lie,  

On brows and cheeks with blood-drops wet  
The light of beauty lingers yet.  
Such beauty ne'er is found in death,  
But vanishes with parting breath.  
O, trust the hope these tokens give:  
The heroes are not dead, but live.'  

Then Sítá joined her hands, and sighed,  
'O, may thy words be verified!'  
The car was turned, which fleet as thought  
The mourning queen to Lanká brought.  
They led her to the garden, where  
Again she yielded to despair,  
Lamenting for the chiefs who bled  
On earth's cold bosom with the dead.
