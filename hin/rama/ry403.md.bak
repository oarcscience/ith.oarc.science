### CANTO IV.: THE MARCH.

He ceased; and spurred by warlike pride  
The impetuous son of Raghu cried:  
'Soon shall mine arm with wrathful joy  
That city of the foe destroy.  
Now, chieftain, now collect the host,  
And onward to the southern coast!  
The sun in his meridian tower  
Gives glory to the Vánar power.  
The demon lord who stole my queen  
By timely flight his life may screen.  
She, when she knows her lord is near,  
Will cling to hope and banish fear,  
Saved like a dying wretch who sips  
The drink of Gods with fevered lips.  
Arise, thy troops to battle lead:  
All happy omens counsel speed.  
The Lord of Stars in favouring skies  
Bodes glory to our enterprise.  
This arm shall slay the fiend; and she.  
My consort, shall again be free.  

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span>  

Mine upward-throbbing eye foreshows  
The longed-for triumph o'er my foes.  
Far in the van be Níla's post,  
To scan the pathway for the host,  
And let thy bravest and thy best,  
A hundred thousand, wait his hest.  
Go forth, O warrior Níla, lead  
The legions on through wood and mead  
Where pleasant waters cool the ground,  
And honey, flowers, and fruit abound,  
Go, and with timely care prevent  
The Rákshas foeman's dark intent.  
With watchful troops each valley guard  
Ere brooks and fruits and roots be marred  
And search each glen and leafy shade  
For hostile troops in ambuscade.  
But let the weaklings stay behind:  
For heroes is our task designed.  
Let thousands of the Vánar breed  
The vanguard of the armies lead:  
Fierce and terrific must it be  
As billows of the stormy sea.  
There be the hill-huge Gaja's place,  
And Gavaya's, strongest of his race,  
And, like the bull that leads the herd,  
Gaváksha's, by no fears deterred  
Let Rishabh, matchless in the might  
Of warlike arms, protect our right,  
And Gandhamádan next in rank  
Defend and guide the other flank.  
I, like the God who rules the sky  
Borne on Airávat <span id="fr_910"></span>[1](#fn_910.md) mounted high  
On stout Hanúmán's back will ride,  
The central host to cheer and guide.  
Fierce as the God who rules below,  
On Angad's back let Lakshman show  
Like him who wealth to mortals shares, <span
id="fr_911"></span>[2](#fn_911.md)  
The lord whom Sárvabhauma <span id="fr_912"></span>[3](#fn_912.md) bears.  
The bold Sushen's impetuous might,  
And Vegadars'í's piercing sight,  
And Jámbaván whom bears revere,  
Illustrious three, shall guard the rear.'  

He ceased, the royal Vánar heard,  
And swift, obedient to his word,  
Sprang forth in numbers none might tell  
From mountain, care, and bosky dell,  
From rocky ledge and breezy height,  
Fierce Vánars burning for the fight.  
And Ráma's course was southward bent  
Amid the mighty armament.  
On, joyous, pressed in close array  
The hosts who owned Sugríva's sway,  
With nimble feet, with rapid bound  
Exploring, ere they passed, the ground,  
While from ten myriad throats rang out  
The challenge and the battle shout.  

On roots and honeycomb they fed,  
And clusters from the boughs o'erhead,  
Or from the ground the tall trees tore  
Rich with the flowery load they bore.  
Some carried comrades, wild with mirth,  
Then cast their riders to the earth,  
Who swiftly to their feet arose  
And overthrew their laughing foes.  
While still rang out the general cry,  
'King Rávan and his fiends shall die,'  
Still on, exulting in the pride  
Of conscious strength, the Vánars hied,  
And gazed where noble Sahya, best  
of mountains, raised each towering crest.  
They looked on lake and streamlet, where  
The lotus bloom was bright and fair,  
Nor marched--for Ráma's hest they feared  
Where town or haunt of men appeared.  
Still onward, fearful as the waves  
Of Ocean when he roars and raves,  
Led by their eager chieftains, went  
The Vánars' countless armament.  
Each captain, like a noble steed  
Urged by the lash to double speed.  
Pressed onward, filled with zeal and pride,  
By Ráma's and his brother's side,  
Who high above the Vánar throng  
On mighty backs were borne along,  
Like the great Lords of Day and Night  
Seized by eclipsing planets might.  
Then Lakshman radiant as the morn,  
On Angad's shoulders high upborne.  
With sweet consoling words that woke  
New ardour, to his brother spoke:  
'Soon shalt thou turn, thy queen regained  
And impious Rávan's life-blood drained,  
In happiness and high renown  
To dear Ayodhyá's happy town.  
I see around exceeding fair  
All omens of the earth and air.  
Auspicious breezes sweet and low  
To greet the Vánar army blow,  
And softly to my listening ear  
Come the glad cries of bird and deer.  
Bright is the sky around us, bright  
Without a cloud the Lord of Light,  
And S'ukra <span id="fr_913"></span>[1b](#fn_913.md) with propitious love  
Looks on thee from his throne above.  
The pole-star and the Sainted Seven <span
id="fr_914"></span>[2b](#fn_914.md)  
Shine brightly in the northern heaven,  
And great Tris'anku, <span id="fr_915"></span>[3b](#fn_915.md) glorious
king,  

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>  

Ikshváku's son from whom we spring,  
Beams in unclouded glory near  
His holy priest <span id="fr_916"></span>[1](#fn_916.md) whom all revere.  
Undimmed the two Vis'ákhás <span id="fr_917"></span>[2](#fn_917.md)
shine,  
The strength and glory of our line,  
And Nairrit's <span id="fr_918"></span>[3](#fn_918.md) influence that
aids  
Our Rákshas foemen faints and fades.  
The running brooks are fresh and fair,  
The boughs their ripening clusters bear,  
And scented breezes gently sway  
The leaflet of the tender spray.  
See, with a glory half divine  
The Vánars' ordered legions shine,  
Bright as the Gods' exultant train  
Who saw the demon Tárak slain.  
O let thine eyes these signs behold,  
And bid thy heart be glad and bold.'  

The Vánar squadrons densely spread  
O'er all the country onward sped,  
While rising from the rapid beat  
Of bears' and monkeys' hastening feet  
Dust hid the earth with thickest veil,  
And made the struggling sunbeams pale.  
Now where Mahendra's peaks arise  
Came Ráma of the lotus eyes  
And the long arm's resistless might,  
And clomb the mountain's wood-crowned height.  
Thence Das'aratha's son beheld  
Where billowy Ocean rose and swelled.  
Past Malaya's peaks and Sahya's chain  
The Vánar legions reached the main,  
And stood in many a marshalled band  
On loud-resounding Ocean's strand.  
To the fair wood that fringed the tide  
Came Das'aratha's son, and cried:  
'At length, my lord Sugríva, we  
Have reached King Várun's realm the sea,  
And one great thought, still-vexing, how  
To cross the flood, awaits us now.  
The broad deep ocean, that denies  
A passage, stretched before us lies.  
Then let us halt and plan the while  
How best to storm the giant's isle.'  

He ceased: Sugríva on the coast  
By trees o'ershadowed stayed the host,  
That seemed in glittering lines to be  
The bright waves of a second sea.  
Then from the shore the captains gazed  
On billows which the breezes raised  

To fury, as they dashed in foam  
O'er Várun's realm, the Asurs' home: <span
id="fr_919"></span>[1b](ry404.htm#fn_919.md)  
The sea that laughed with foam, and danced  
With waves whereon the sunbeams glanced:  
Where, when the light began to fade,  
Huge crocodiles and monsters played;  
And, when the moon went up the sky,  
The troubled billows rose on high  
From the wild watery world whereon  
A thousand moons reflected shone:  
Where awful serpents swam and showed  
Their fiery crests which flashed and glowed,  
Illumining the depths of hell,  
The prison where the demons dwell.  
The eye, bewildered, sought in vain  
The bounding line of sky and main:  
Alike in shade, alike in glow  
Were sky above and sea below.  
There wave-like clouds by clouds were chased,  
Here cloud-like billows roared and raced:  
Then shone the stars, and many a gem  
That lit the waters answered them.  
They saw the great-souled Ocean stirred  
To frenzy by the winds, and heard,  
Loud as ten thousand drums, the roar  
Of wild waves dashing on the shore.  
They saw him mounting to defy  
With deafening voice the troubled sky.  
And the deep bed beneath him swell  
In fury as the billows fell.
