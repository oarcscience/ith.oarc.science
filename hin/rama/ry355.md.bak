### CANTO XIII.: DESPAIR AND HOPE.

Then rapid as the lightning's flame  
From Rávan's halls the Vánar came  
Each lingering hope was cold and dead,  
And thus within his heart he said:  
'Alas, my fruitless search is done:  
Long have I toiled for Raghu's son;  
And yet with all my care have seen  
No traces of the ravished queen.  
It may be, while the giant through  
The lone air with his captive flew,  
The Maithil lady, tender-souled,  
Slipped struggling from the robber's hold,  
And the wild sea is rolling now  
O'er Sítá of the beauteous brow.  
Or did she perish of alarm  
When circled by the monster's arm?  
Or crushed, unable to withstand  
The pressure of that monstrous hand?  
Or when she spurned his suit with scorn,  
Her tender limbs were rent and torn.  
And she, her virtue unsubdued,  
Was slaughtered for the giant's food.  
Shall I to Raghu's son relate  
His well-beloved consort's fate,  
My crime the same if I reveal  
The mournful story or conceal?  
If with no happier tale to tell  
I seek our mountain citadel,  
How shall I face our lord the king,  
And meet his angry questioning?  
How shall I greet my friends, and brook  
The muttered taunt, the scornful look?  
How to the son of Raghu go  
And kill him with my tale of woe?  
For sure the mournful tale I bear  
Will strike him dead with wild despair.  
And Lakshman ever fond and true,  
Will, undivided, perish too.  
Bharat will learn his brother's fate,  
And die of grief disconsolate,  
And sad Satrughna with a cry  
Of anguish on his corpse will die.  
Our king Sugrívar found;  
True to each bond in honour bound.  
Will mourn the pledge he vainly gave,  
And die with him he could not save.  
Then Rumá his devoted wife  
For her dead lord will leave her life,  
And Tára, widowed and forlorn,  
Will die in anguish, sorrow-worn.  

On Angad too the blow will fall  
Killing the hope and joy of all.  
The ruin of their prince and king  
The Vánarsls with woe will wring,  
And each, overwhelmed with dark despair,  
Will beat his head and rend his hair.  
Each, graced and honoured long, will miss  
His careless life of easy bliss,  
In happy troops will play no more  
On breezy rock and shady shore,  
But with his darling wife and child  
Will seek the mountain top, and wild  
With hopeless desolation, throw  
Himself, his wife, and babe, below.  
All no: unless the dame I find  
I ne'er will meet my Vánar,  
Here rather in some distant dell  
A lonely hermit will I dwell,  
Where roots and berries will supply  
My humble wants until I die;  
Or on the shore will raise a pyre  
And perish in the kindled fire.  
Or I will strictly fast until  
With slow decay my life I kill,  
And ravening dogs and birds of air  
The limbs of Hanumánl tear.  
Here will I die, but never bring  
Destruction on my race and king.  
But still unsearched one grove I see  
With many a bright As'oka tree.  
There will I enter in, and through  
The tangled shade my search renew.  
Be glory to the host on high,  
The Sun and Moon who light the sky,  
The Vasus  <span id="fr_822"></span>[1](ry356.htm#fn_822.md) and the
Maruts'  <span id="fr_823"></span>[2](ry356.htm#fn_823.md) train,  
Ádityas  <span id="fr_824"></span>[3](ry356.htm#fn_824.md) and the As'vins
 <span id="fr_825"></span>[4](ry356.htm#fn_825.md) twain.  
So may I win success, and bring  
The lady back with triumphing,'
