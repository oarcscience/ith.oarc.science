<P>
Then Indra, he whose fiery stroke<BR>
Slew furious P&aacute;ka, turned and spoke:<BR>
'A glorious day, O chief, is this,<BR>
Rich with the fruit of lasting bliss.<BR>
Well pleased are we: we love thee well<BR>
Now speak, thy secret wishes tell.'<BR>

<P>
Thus spake the sovereign of the sky,<BR>
And this was R&aacute;ma's glad reply:<BR>
'If I have won your grace, incline<BR>
To grant this one request of mine.<BR>
Restore, O King: the V&aacute;nar dead<BR>
Whose blood for me was nobly shed.<BR>

<P>
To life and strength my friends recall,<BR>
And bring them back from Yama's hall.<BR>
When, fresh in might the warriors rise,<BR>
Prepare a feast to glad their eyes.<BR>
Let fruits of every season glow,<BR>
And streams of purest water flow.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Raghu's son, great-hearted, prayed,<BR>
And Indra thus his answer made:<BR>
'High is the boon thou seekest: none<BR>
Should win this grace but Raghu's son.<BR>
Yet, faithful to the word I spake,<BR>
I grant the prayer for thy dear sake.<BR>
The V&aacute;nars whom the giants slew<BR>
Their life and vigour shall renew.<BR>
Their strength repaired, their gashes healed<BR>
Whose torrents dyed the battle field,<BR>
The warrior hosts from death shall rise *<BR>
Like sleepers when their slumber flies.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Restored from Yama's dark domain<BR>
The V&aacute;nar legions filled the plain,<BR>
And, round the royal chief arrayed,<BR>
With wondering hearts obeisance paid.<BR>
Each God the son of Raghu praised,<BR>
And cried as loud his voice he raised:<BR>
'Turn, King, to fair Ayodhy&aacute; speed,<BR>
And leave thy friends of V&aacute;nar breed.<BR>
Thy true devoted consort cheer<BR>
After long days of woe and fear.<BR>
Bharat, thy loyal brother, see,<BR>
A hermit now for love of thee.<BR>
The tears of Queen Kaus'aly&aacute; dry,<BR>
And light with joy each stepdame's eye;<BR>
Then consecrated king of men<BR>
Make glad each faithful citizen,'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They ceased: and borne on radiant cars<BR>
Sought their bright home amid the stars.<BR>
