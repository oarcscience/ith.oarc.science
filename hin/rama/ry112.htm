<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXIV.: R&Aacute;MA IN THE PALACE.</H3>
<P>
The dark incomparable chief<BR>
Whose eye was like a lotus leaf,<BR>
Cried to the mournful charioteer,<BR>
'Go tell my sire that I am here.'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sumantra, sad and all dismayed,<BR>
The chieftain's order swift obeyed.<BR>
Within the palace doors he hied<BR>
And saw the king, who wept and sighed.<BR>
Like the great sun when wrapped in shade<BR>
Like fire by ashes overlaid,<BR>
Or like a pool with waters dried,<BR>
So lay the world's great lord and pride,<BR>
A while the wise Sumantra gazed<BR>
On him whose senses woe has dazed,<BR>
Grieving for R&aacute;ma. Near he drew<BR>
With hands upraised in reverence due.<BR>
With blessing first his king he hailed;<BR>
Then with a voice that well-nigh failed,<BR>
In trembling accents soft and low<BR>
Addressed the monarch in his woe:<BR>
'The prince of men, thy R&aacute;ma, waits<BR>
Before thee at the palace gates.<BR>
His wealth to Br&aacute;hmans he has dealt,<BR>
And all whom in his home have dwelt.<BR>
Admit thy son. His friends have heard<BR>
His kind farewell and parting word,<BR>
He longs to see thee first, and then<BR>
Will seek the wilds, O King of men.<BR>
He, with each princely virtue's blaze,<BR>
Shines as the sun engirt by rays.'<BR>

<P>
The truthful King who loved to keep<BR>
The law profound as Ocean's deep,<BR>
And stainless as the dark blue sky,<BR>
Thus to Sumantra made reply:<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
'Go then, Sumantra, go and call<BR>
My wives and ladies one and all.<BR>
Drawn round me shall they fill the place<BR>
When I behold my R&aacute;ma's face.'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Quick to the inner rooms he sped,<BR>
And thus to all the women said,<BR>
'Come, at the summons of the king:<BR>
Come all, and make no tarrying.'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Their husband's word, by him conveyed,<BR>
Soon as they heard, the dames obeyed,<BR>
And following his guidance all<BR>
Came thronging to the regal hall.<BR>
ln number half seven hundred, they,<BR>
All lovely dames, in long array,<BR>
With their bright eyes for weeping red,<BR>
To stand round Queen Kaus'aly&aacute;, sped.<BR>
They gathered, and the monarch viewed<BR>
One moment all the multitude,<BR>
Then to Sumantra spoke and said:<BR>
'Now let my son be hither led.'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sumantra went. Then R&aacute;ma came,<BR>
And Lakshman, and the Maithil dame,<BR>
And, as he led them on, their guide<BR>
Straight to the monarch's presence hied.<BR>
When yet far off the father saw<BR>
His son with raised palms toward him draw,<BR>
Girt by his ladies, sick with woes,<BR>
Swift from his royal seat he rose.<BR>
With all his strength the aged man<BR>
To meet his darling R&aacute;ma ran,<BR>
But trembling, wild with dark despair,<BR>
Fell on the ground and fainted there.<BR>
And Lakshman, wont in cars to ride,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, threw them by the side<BR>
Of the poor miserable king,<BR>
Half lifeless with his sorrow's sting.<BR>
Throughout the spacious hall up went<BR>
A thousand women's wild lament:<BR>
'Ah R&aacute;ma!' thus they wailed and wept,<BR>
And anklets tinkled as they stepped.<BR>
Around his body, weeping, threw<BR>
Their loving arms the brothers two,<BR>
And then, with Sit&aacute;'s gentle aid,<BR>
The king upon a couch was laid.<BR>
At length to earth's imperial lord,<BR>
When life and knowledge were restored,<BR>
Though seas of woe went o'er his head,<BR>
With suppliant hand, thus R&aacute;ma said:<BR>
'Lord ot us all, great King, thou art:<BR>
Bid me farewell before we part,<BR>
To Dandak wood this day I go:<BR>
One blessing and one look bestow.<BR>
Let Lakshman my companion be,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute; also follow me.<BR>
With truthful pleas I sought to bend<BR>
Their purpose; but no ear they lend.<BR>
Now cast this sorrow from thy heart,<BR>
And let us all, great King, depart.<BR>
As Brahm&aacute; sends his children, so<BR>
Let Lakshman, me, and S&iacute;t&aacute; go.'<BR>

<P>
He stood unmoved, and watched intent<BR>
Until the king should grant consent.<BR>
Upon his son his eyes he cast,<BR>
And thus the monarch spake at last:<BR>
'O R&aacute;ma, by her arts enslaved,<BR>
I gave the boons Kaikey&iacute; craved,<BR>
Unfit to reign, by her misled:<BR>
Be ruler in thy father's stead.'<BR>

<P>
Thus by the lord of men addressed,<BR>
R&aacute;ma, of virtue's friends the best,<BR>
In lore of language duly learned,<BR>
His answer, reverent, thus returned:<BR>
'A thousand years, O King, remain<BR>
O'er this our city still to reign.<BR>
I in the woods my life will lead:<BR>
The lust of rule no more I heed.<BR>
Nine years and five I there will spend,<BR>
And when the portioned days shall end,<BR>
Will come, my vows and exile o'er,<BR>
And clasp thy feet, my King, once more.'<BR>

<P>
A captive in the snare of truth,<BR>
Weeping, distressed with woe and ruth,<BR>
Thus spake the monarch, while the queen<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; urged him on unseen:<BR>
'Go then, O R&aacute;ma, and begin<BR>
Thy course unvext by fear and sin:<BR>
Go, my beloved son, and earn<BR>
Success, and joy, and safe return.<BR>
So fast the bonds of duty bind.<BR>
O Raghu's son, thy truthful mind,<BR>
That naught can turn thee back, or guide<BR>
Thy will so strongly fortified.<BR>
But 0, a little longer stay.<BR>
Nor turn thy steps this night away,<BR>
That I one little day--alas!<BR>
One only--with my son may pass.<BR>
Me and thy mother do not slight,<BR>
But stay, my son, with me to-night;<BR>
With every dainty please thy taste,<BR>
And seek to-morrow morn the waste<BR>
Hard is thy task, O Raghu's son,<BR>
Dire is the toil thou wilt not shun,<BR>
Far to the lonely wood to flee,<BR>
And leave thy friends for love of me.<BR>
I swear it by my truth, believe,<BR>
For thee, my son, I deeply grieve,<BR>
Misguided by the traitress dame<BR>
With hidden guile like smouldering flame.<BR>
Now, by her wicked counsel stirred,<BR>
Thou fain wouldst keep my plighted word.<BR>
No marvel that my eldest born<BR>
Would hold me true when I have sworn.'<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma having calmly heard<BR>
His wretched father speak each word,<BR>
With Lakshman standing br his side<BR>
Thus, humbly, to the King replied:<BR>
'If dainties now my taste regale,<BR>
To-morrow must those dainties fail.<BR>
This day departure I prefer<BR>
To all that wealth can minister.<BR>
O'er this fair land, no longer mine,<BR>
Which I, with all her realms, resign,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Her multitudes of men,  her grain,<BR>
Her stores of wealth, let Bharat reign.<BR>
And let the promised boon which thou<BR>
Wast pleased to grant the queen ere now,<BR>
Be hers in full. Be true, O King,<BR>
Kind giver of each precious thing.<BR>
Thy spoken word I still will heed,<BR>
Obeying all thy lips decreed:<BR>
And fourteen years in woods will dwell<BR>
With those who live in glade and dell.<BR>
No hopes of power my heart can touch,<BR>
No selfish joys attract so much<BR>
As son of Raghu, to fulfil<BR>
With heart and soul my father's will.<BR>
Dismiss, dismiss thy needless woe,<BR>
Nor let those drowning torrents flow:<BR>
The Lord of Rivers in his pride<BR>
Keeps to the banks that bar his tide.<BR>
Here in thy presence I declare;<BR>
By thy good deeds, thy truth, I swear;<BR>
Nor lordship, joy, nor lands I prize;<BR>
Life, heaven, all blessings I despise.<BR>
I wish to see thee still remain<BR>
Most true, O King, and free from stain.<BR>
It must not, Sire, it must not be:<BR>
I cannot rest one hour with thee.<BR>
Then bring this sorrow to an end,<BR>
For naught my settled will can bend.<BR>
I gave a pledge that binds me too,<BR>
And to that pledge I still am true.<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; bade me speed away:<BR>
She prayed me, and I answered yea.<BR>
Pine not for me, and weep no more;<BR>
The wood for us has joy in store,<BR>
Filled with the wild deer's peaceful herds<BR>
And voices of a thousand birds.<BR>
A father is the God of each,<BR>
Yea, e'en of Gods, so Scriptures teach:<BR>
And I will keep my sire's decree,<BR>
For as a God I honour thee.<BR>
O best of men, the time is nigh,<BR>
The fourteen years will soon pass by<BR>
And to thine eyes thy son restore:<BR>
Be comforted, and weep no more.<BR>
Thou with thy firmness shouldst support<BR>
These weeping crowds who throng the court;<BR>
Then why, O chief of high renown,<BR>
So troubled, and thy soul cast down?'<BR>
