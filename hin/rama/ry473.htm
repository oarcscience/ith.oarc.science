<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XCVI.: R&Aacute;VAN'S SALLY.</H3>
<P>
The groans and cries of dames who wailed<BR>
The ears of Lank&aacute;'s lord assailed,<BR>
For from each house and home was sent<BR>
The voice of weeping and lament.<BR>
In troubled thought his head he bowed,<BR>
Then fiercely loosing on the crowd<BR>
Of nobles near his throne he broke<BR>
The silence, and in fury spoke:<BR>
'This day my deadly shafts shall fly,<BR>
And Raghu's sons shall surely die.<BR>
This day shall countless V&aacute;nars bleed<BR>
And dogs and kites and vultures feed.<BR>
Go, bid them swift my car prepare,<BR>
Bring the great bow I long to bear:<BR>
And let my host with sword and shield<BR>
And spear be ready for the field.'<BR>

<P>
From street to street the captains passed<BR>
And R&aacute;kshas warriors gathered fast.<BR>
With spear and sword to pierce and strike,<BR>
And axe and club and mace and pike. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1013"></A><A HREF="#fn_1013"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>

Then R&aacute;van's warrior chariot &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1014"></A><A HREF="#fn_1014"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> wrought<BR>
With gold and rich inlay was brought.<BR>
Mid tinkling bells and weapons' clang<BR>
The monarch on the chariot sprang,<BR>
Which, decked with gems of every hue,<BR>
Eight steeds of noble lineage drew.<BR>
Mid roars of drum and shell rang out<BR>
From countless throats a joyful shout.<BR>
As, girt with hosts in warlike pride.<BR>
Through Lank&aacute;'s streets the tyrant hied.<BR>
Still, louder than the roar of drums,<BR>
Went up the cry 'He comes, he comes,<BR>
Our ever conquering lord who trod<BR>
Beneath his feet both fiend and God.'<BR>
On to the gate the warriors swept<BR>
Where Raghu's sons their station kept.<BR>
When R&aacute;van's car the portal passed<BR>
The sun in heaven was overcast.<BR>
Earth rocked and reeled from side to side<BR>
And birds with boding voices cried.<BR>
Against the standard of the king<BR>
A vulture flapped his horrid wing.<BR>
Big gouts of blood before him dropped,<BR>
His trembling steeds in terror stopped.<BR>
The hue of death was on his cheek,<BR>
And scarce his flattering tongue could speak,<BR>
When, terrible with flash and flame,<BR>
Through murky air a meteor came.<BR>
Still by the hand of Death impelled<BR>
His onward way the giant held.<BR>
The V&aacute;nars in the field afar<BR>
Heard the loud thunder of his car.<BR>
And turned with warriors' fierce delight<BR>
To meet the giant in the fight.<BR>
He came: his clanging bow he drew<BR>
And myriads of the V&aacute;nars slew.<BR>
Some through the side and heart he cleft,<BR>
Some headless on the plain were left.<BR>
Some struggling groaned with mangled thighs,<BR>
Or broken arms or blinded eyes. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1015"></A><A HREF="#fn_1015"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_1012"></A><A HREF="ry472.htm#fr_1012">488:1</A>  I omit two Cantos in the first of which
R&aacute;ma with an enchanted Gandharva
weapon deals destruction among the
R&aacute;kshases sent out by R&aacute;van, and in the
second the R&aacute;kshas dames' lament the
slain and mourn over the madness of
R&aacute;van.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1013"></A><A HREF="ry473.htm#fr_1013">488:2</A>  I omit several weapons for which I
cannot find distinctive names, and among
them the <I>Sataghn&iacute;</I> or <I>Centicide</I>, supposed
by some to be a kind of fire-arms or rocket,
but described by a commentator on the
Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata as a stone or cylindrical
piece of wood studded with iron spikes.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1014"></A><A HREF="ry473.htm#fr_1014">488:1b</A>  The chariots of R&aacute;van's present army
are said to have been one hundred and
fifty million in number with three hundred
million elephants, and twelve hundred
million horses and asses. The footmen
are merely said to have been 'unnumbered.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1015"></A><A HREF="ry473.htm#fr_1015">488:2b</A>  I omit Cantos XCVII., XCVIII,and
XCIX, which describe in the usual way
three single combats between Sugr&iacute;va and
Angad on the V&aacute;nar side and Vir&uacute;paksha,
Mahodar, and Mah&aacute;p&aacute;rs'va on the side of
the giants. The weapons of the V&aacute;nars
are trees and rocks: the giants fight with
swords, axes, and bows and arrows. The
details are generally the same as those of
preceding duels. The giants fall, one in
each Canto.</P>
