### CANTO XXXIX.: LANKÁ.

They slept secure: the sun arose  
And called the chieftains from repose.  
Before the wondering Vánars, gay  
With grove and garden, Lanká lay,  
Where golden buds the Champak showed,  
And bright with bloom As'oka glowed,  
And palm and Sál and many a tree  
With leaf and flower were fair to see.  
They looked on wood and lawn and glade,  
On emerald grass and dusky shade,  
Where creepers filled the air with scent.  
And luscious fruit the branches bent,  
Where bees inebriate loved to throng,  
And each sweet bird was loud in song.  
The wondering Vánars passed the bound  
That circled that enchanting ground,  
And as they came a sweet breeze through  
The odorous alleys softly blew.  
Some Vánars, at their king's behest,  
Onward to bannered Lanká pressed,  
While, startled by the strangers' tread,  
The birds and deer before them fled.  
Earth trembled at each step they took,  
And Lanká at their shouting shook.  
Bright rose before their wondering eyes  
Trikata's \* peak that kissed the skies,  
And, clothed with flowers of every hue,  
And its golden alin \* thr \*.  
More fair to see the \* mountain's head

A hundred leagues in length was spread.  
There Rávan's town, securely placed,  
The summit of Trikúta graced.  
O'er leagues of land she stretched in pride,  
A hundred long and twenty wide.  
They saw a lofty wall enfold  
The city, built of blocks of gold,  
They saw the beams of morning fall  
On dome and fane within the wall,  
Bright with the shine that mansion gives  
Where Vishnu in his glory lives.  
White-created like the Lord of Snows  
Before them Rávan's palace rose.  
High on a thousand pillars raised  
With gold and precious stone it blazed,  
Guarded by giant warders, crown  
And ornament of Lanká's town.
