He stood within the pleasant ground,<BR>

And with delighted eyes surveyed<BR>
The climbing plants and varied shade,<BR>
He saw unnumbered trees unfold<BR>
The treasures of their pendent gold,<BR>
As, searching for the Maithil queen,<BR>
He strayed through alleys soft and green;<BR>
And when a spray he bent or broke<BR>
Some little bird that slept awoke.<BR>
Whene'er the breeze of morning blew,<BR>
Where'er a startled peacock flew,<BR>
The gaily coloured branches shed<BR>
Their flowery rain upon his head<BR>
That clung around the V&aacute;nar till<BR>
He seemed a blossom-covered hill, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_826"></A><A HREF="ry357.htm#fn_826"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
The earth, on whose fair bosom lay<BR>
The flowers that fell from every spray,<BR>
Was glorious as a lovely maid<BR>
In all her brightest robes arrayed,<BR>
He saw the breath of morning shake<BR>
The lilies on the rippling lake<BR>
Whose waves a pleasant lapping made<BR>
On crystal steps with gems inlaid.<BR>
Then roaming through the enchanted ground,<BR>
A pleasant hill the V&aacute;nar found,<BR>
And grottoes in the living stone<BR>
With grass and flowery trees o'ergrown.<BR>
Through rocks and boughs a brawling rill<BR>
Leapt from the bosom of the hill,<BR>
Like a proud beauty when she flies<BR>
From her love's arms with angry eyes.<BR>
He clomb a tree that near him grew<BR>
And leafy shade around him threw.<BR>
'Hence,' thought the V&aacute;nar, 'shall I see<BR>
The Maithil dame, if here she be,<BR>
These lovely trees, this cool retreat<BR>
Will surely tempt her wandering feet.<BR>
Here the sad queen will roam apart.<BR>
And dream of R&aacute;ma in her heart,'<BR>
