<P>
Deep, pleasant was the chariot's sound<BR>
As royal Bharat, far renowned,<BR>
Whirled by his mettled coursers fast<BR>
Within Ayodhy&aacute;'s city passed.<BR>
There dark and drear was every home<BR>
Where cats and owls had space to roam,<BR>
As when the shades of midnight fall<BR>
With blackest gloom, and cover all:<BR>
As Rohin&iacute;, dear spouse of him<BR>
Whom Rahu &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_396"></A><A HREF="#fn_396"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> hates, grows faint and dim,<BR>
When, as she shines on high alone<BR>
The demon's shade is o'er her thrown:<BR>
As burnt by summer's heat a rill<BR>
Scarce trickling from her parent hill,<BR>
With dying fish in pools half dried,<BR>
And fainting birds upon her side:<BR>
As sacrificial flames arise<BR>
When holy oil their food supplies,<BR>
But when no more the fire is fed<BR>
Sink lustreless and cold and dead:<BR>
Like some brave host that filled the plain,<BR>
With harness rent and captains slain,<BR>
When warrior, elephant, and steed<BR>
Mingled in wild confusion bleed:<BR>
As when, all spent her store of worth,<BR>
Rocks from her base the loosened earth:<BR>
Like a sad fallen star no more<BR>
Wearing the lovely light it wore:<BR>
So mournful in her lost estate<BR>
Was that sad town disconsolate.<BR>
Then car-borne Bharat, good and brave,<BR>
Thus spake to him the steeds who drave:<BR>
'Why are Ayodhy&aacute;'s streets so mute!<BR>
Where is the voice of lyre and lute?<BR>
Why sounds not, as of old, to-day<BR>
The music of the minstrel's lay?<BR>

Where are the wreaths they used to twine?<BR>
Where are the blossoms and the wine?<BR>
Where is the cool refreshing scent<BR>
Of sandal dust with aloe blent?<BR>
The elephant's impatient roar,<BR>
The din of cars, I hear no more:<BR>
No more the horse's pleasant neigh<BR>
Rings out to meet me on my way.<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute;'s youths, since R&aacute;ma's flight,<BR>
Have lost their relish for delight:<BR>
Her men roam forth no more, nor care<BR>
Bright garlands round their necks to wear.<BR>
All grieve for banished R&aacute;ma: feast,<BR>
And revelry and song have ceased:<BR>
Like a black night when floods pour down,<BR>
So dark and gloomy is the town.<BR>
When will he come to make them gay<BR>
Like some auspicious holiday?<BR>
When will my brother, like a cloud<BR>
At summer's close, make glad the crowd?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then through the streets the hero rode,<BR>
And passed within his sire's abode,<BR>
Like some deserted lion's den,<BR>
Forsaken by the lord of men.<BR>
Then to the inner bowers he came,<BR>
Once happy home of many a dame,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now gloomy, sad, and drear,<BR>
Dark as of old that sunless day<BR>
When wept the Gods in wild dismay;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_397"></A><A HREF="ry193.htm#fn_397"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  There poured he many a tear.<BR>
