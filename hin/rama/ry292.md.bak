### CANTO XVIII.: RÁMA'S REPLY.

He ceased: and Ráma's heart was stirred  
At every keen reproach he heard.  
There Báli lay, a dim dark sun,  
His course of light and glory run;  
Or like the bed of Ocean dried  
Of his broad floods from side to side,  
Or helpless, as the dying fire,  
Hushed his last words of righteous ire.  
Then Ráma, with his spirit moved,  
The Vánar king in turn reproved:  
'Why dost thou Báli, thus revile,  
And castest not a glance the while  
On claims of duty, love, and gain,  
And customs o'er the world that reign?  
Why dost thou blame me, rash and blind,  
Fickle as all thy Vánar kind.  
Slighting each rule of ancient days  
Which all the good and prudent praise?  
This land, each hill and woody chase,  
Belongs to old Ikshváku's race:  

With bird and beast and man, the whole  
Is ours to cherish and control.  
Now Bharat, prompt at duty's call,  
Wise, just, and true, is lord of all.  
Each claim of law, love, gain he knows,  
And wrath and favour duly shows.  
A king from truth who never bends,  
And grace with vigour wisely blends;  
With valour worthy of his race,  
He knows the claims of time and place,  
Now we and other kings of might,  
By his ensample taught aright,  
The lands of every region tread  
That justice may increase and spread.  
While royal Bharat, wise and just,  
Rules the broad earth, his glorious trust,  
Who shall attempt, while he is lord,  
A deed by Justice held abhorred?  
We now, as Bharat has decreed,  
Let justice guide our every deed,  
And toil each sinner to repress  
Who scorns the way of righteousness.  
Thou from that path hast turned aside,  
And virtue's holy law defied.  
Left the fair path which kings should tread,  
And followed pleasure's voice instead.  
The man who cleaves to duty's law  
Regards these three with filial awe--  
The sire, the elder brother, third  
Him from whose lips his lore he heard.  
Thus too, for duty's sake, the wise  
Regard with fond paternal eyes  
The well-loved younger brother, one  
Their lore has ripened, and a son.  
Fine are the laws which guide the good,  
Abstruse, and hardly understood;  
Only the soul, enthroned within  
The breast of each, knows right from sin  
But thou art wild and weak of soul,  
And spurnest, like thy race, control;  
The true and right thou canst not find.  
Tht blind consulting with the blind.  
Incline thine ear and I will teach  
The cause that prompts my present speech  
This tempest of thy soul assuage  
Nor blame me in thine idle rage.  
On this great sin thy thoughts bestow,  
The sin for which I lay thee low.  
Thou, Báli, in thy brother's life  
Hast robbed him of his wedded wife,  
And keepest, scorning ancient right,  
His Rumá for thine own delight.  
Thy son's own wife should scarcely be  
More sacred in thine eyes than she.  
All duty thou hast scorned, and hence  
Comes punishment for dire offence.  
For those who blindly do amiss  
There is, I ween, no way but this:  
To check the rash who dare to stray  
From custom which the good obey,  
I may not, sprung of Kshatriya line,  

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>  

Forgive this heinous sin of thine:  
The laws for those who sin like thee  
The penalty of death decree.  
Now Bharat rules with sovereign sway,  
And we his royal word obey.  
Tnere was no hope of pardon, none,  
For the vile deed that thou hast done,  
That wisest monarch dooms to die  
The wretch whose crimes the law defy;  
And we, chastising those who err,  
His righteous doom administer.  
Mv soul accounts Sugríva dear  
E'en as my brother Lakshman here.  
He brings me blessing, and I swore  
his wife and kingdom to restore:  
A bond in solemn honour bound  
When Vánar chieftains stood around.  
And can a king like me forsake  
His friend, and plighted promise break?  
Reflect, O Vánar, on the cause,  
The sanction of eternal laws,  
And, justly smitten down, confess  
Thou diest for thy wickediness,  
By honour was I bound to lend  
Assistance to a faithful friend;  
And thou hast met a righteous fate  
Thy former sins to expiate.  
And thus wilt thou some merit win  
And make atonement for thy sin.  
For hear me, Vánar King, rehearse  
What Manu <span id="fr_598"></span>[1](#fn_598.md) spake in ancient
verse,--  
This holy law, which all accept  
Who honour duty, have I kept:  
'Pure grow the sinners kings chastise,  
And, like.the virtuous, gain the skies;  
By pain or full atonement freed,  
They reap the fruit of righteous deed,  
While kings who punish not incur  
The penalties of those who err.'  
Mándhátá <span id="fr_599"></span>[2](#fn_599.md) once, a noble king,  
Light of the line from which I spring,  
Punished with death a devotee  
When he had stooped to sin like thee;  
And many a king in ancient time  
Has punished frantic sinners' crime,  
And, when their impious blood was spilt,  
Has washed away the stain of guilt.  
Cease, Báli, cease; no more complain:  
Reproaches and laments are vain.  
For thou art justly punished: we  
Obey our king and are not free.  
Once more, O Báli, lend thine ear  

Another weightiest plea to hear.  
For this, when heard and pondered well.  
Will all complaint and rage dispel.  
My soul will ne'er this deed repent,  
Nor was my shaft in anger sent.  
We take the silvan tribes beset  
With snare and trap and gin and net,  
And many a heedless deer we smite  
From thickest shade, concealed from sight.  
Wild for the slaughter of the game,  
At stately stags our shafts we aim.  
We strike them bounding scared away,  
We strike them as they stand at bay,  
When careless in the shade they lie,  
Or scan the plain with watchful eye.  
They turn away their heads; we aim,  
And none the eager hunter blame.  
Each royal saint, well trained in law  
Of duty, loves his bow to draw  
And strike the quarry, e'en as thou  
Hast fallen by mine arrow now,  
Fiphting with him or unaware,--  
A Vánar thou.--I little care. <span id="fr_600"></span>[1b](#fn_600.md)  
But yet, O best of Vánars, know  
That kings who rule the earth bestow  
Fruit of pure life and virtuous deed.  
And lofty duty's hard-won meed.  
Harm not thy lord the king: abstain  
From ant and word that cause him pain;  
For kings are children of the skies  
Who walk this earth in men's disguise.  
But thou, in duty's claims untaught,  
thy breast with blinding passion fraught,  
Assailest me who still have clung  
To duty, with thy bitter tongue.'  
   He ceased; and Ball sore distressed  
The sovereign claims of law confessed,  
And freed, o'erwhelmed with woe and shame,  
The lord of Raghu's race from blame.  
Then, reverent palm to palm applied,  
To Ráma thus the Vánar cried:  
'True, best of men, is every word  
That from thy lips these ears have heard,  
It ill beseems a wretch like me  
To bandy empty words with thee.  
Forgive the angry taunts that broke  
From my wild bosom as I spoke.  
And lay not to my charge, O King,  

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>  

My mad reproaches' idle sting.  
Thou, in the truth by trial trained,  
Best knowledge of the right hast gained:  
And layest, just and pure within,  
The meetest penalty on sin.  
Through every bond of law I burst,  
The boldest sinner and the worst.  
O let thy right-instructing speech  
Console my heart and wisely teach.'  
   Like some sad elephant who stands  
Fast sinking in the treacherous sands,  
Thus Báli raised despairing eyes;  
Then spake again with sobs and sighs:  
   'Not for myself, O King, I grieve,  
For Tárá or the friends I leave,  
As for sweet Angad, my dear son,  
My noble, only little one.  
For, nursed in luxury and bliss,  
His father he will mourn and miss,  
And like a stream whose fount is dry  
Will waste away and sink and die,--  
My own dear child, my only boy,  
His mother Tárá's hope and joy.  
Spare him, O son of Raghu, spare  
The child entrusted to thy care.  
My Angad and Sugríva treat  
E'en as thy heart considers meet,  
For thou, O chief of men, art strong  
To guard the right and punish wrong.  
O, if thou wilt thine ear incline  
To hear these dying words of mine,  
He and Sugríva will to thee  
As Bharat and as Lakshman be.  
Let not my Tárá, left forlorn,  
Weep for Sugríva's wrathful scorn;  
Nor let him, for her lord's offence,  
Condemn her faithful innocence.  
And well and wisely may he reign  
If thy dear grace his power sustain:  
If, following thee his friend and guide,  
He turn not from thy hest aside:  
Thus may he reign with glory, nay  
Thus to the skies will win his way.  
Though stayed by Tárá's fond recall,  
By thy dear hand I longed to fall.  
Against my brother rushed and fought,  
And gained the death I long have sought.'  
   Then Ráma thus the prince consoled  
From whose clear eyes the mists were rolled:  
'Grieve not for those thou leavest thus,  
Nor tremble for thyself or us,  
For we will deal with thine and thee  
As duty and the laws decree.  
He who exacts and he who pays,  
Is justly slain or justly slays,  
Shall in the life to come have bliss;  
For each has done his task in this.  
Thou, wandering from the right, art made  
Pure by the forfeit thou hast paid.  
Thy weight of sins is cast aside,  
And duty's claim is satisfied.  
Then grieve no more, O Prince, but clear  
Thy bosom from all doubt and fear,  
For fate, inexorably stern,  
Thou hast no power to move or turn.  
Thy princely Angad still will share  
My tender love. Sugríva's care;  
And to thy offspring shall be shown  
Affection that shall match thine own.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_595"></span>[346:1](ry291.htm#fr_595.md) Hayagríva,
Horse-necked, is a form of Vishnu

<span id="fn_596"></span>[346:2](ry291.htm#fr_596.md) "As'vatara is the
name of a chief of the Nágas or serpents which inhabit the regions under
the earth; it is also the name of a Gandharva. As'vatarí ought to be the
wife of one of the two, but I am not sure that this conjecture is right.
The commentator does not say who this As'vatarí is, or what tradition or
myth, is alluded to. Vimalabodha reads As'vatarí in the nominative case,
and explains, As'vatarí is the sun, and as the sun with his rays brings
back the moon which has been sunk in the ocean and the infernal regions,
so will I bring back Sítá." GORRESIO.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[346:3](ry291.htm#fr_597.md) That is, 'Consider
what answer you can give to your accusers when they charge you with
injustice in killing me.'

<span id="fn_598"></span>[347:1](ry292.htm#fr_598.md) Manu, Book VIII. 318.
"But men who have committed offences and have received from kings the
punishment due to them, go pure to heaven and become as clear as those
who have done well."

<span id="fn_599"></span>[347:2](ry292.htm#fr_599.md) Mándhátá was one of
the earlier descendants of Ikshváku. His name is mentioned in Ráma's
genealogy, p. 81.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[347:1b](ry292.htm#fr_600.md) I cannot understand
how Válmíki could put such an excuse as this into Ráma's mouth. Ráma
with all solemn ceremony, has made a league of alliance with Báli's
younger brother whom he regards as a dear friend and almost as an equal,
and now he winds up his reasons for killing Báli by coolly saying:
'Besides you are only a monkey, you know, after all, and as such I have
every right to kill you how, when, and where I like.'
