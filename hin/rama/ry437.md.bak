### CANTO XXXVIII.: THE ASCENT OF SUVELA.

'Come let us scale,' the hero cried,  
'This hill with various metals dyed.  
This night upon the breezy crest  
Sugríva, Lakshman, I, will rest,  
With sage Vibhíshan, faithful friend,  
His counsel and his lore to lend.  
From these tall\* peaks each eager eye  
The foeman's city shall espy,  
Who from the wood my darling stole  
And brought long anguish on my soul.'  

Thus spake the lord of men, and bent  
His footsteps to the steep ascent,  
And Lakshman, true in weal and woe,  
Next followed with his shafts and bow.  
Vibhíshan followed, next in place,  
The sovereign of the Vánar race,  
And hundreds of the forest kind  
Thronged with impetuous feet, behind.  
The chiefs in woods and mountains bred  
Fast followed to Suvela's head,  
And gazed on Lanká bright and fair  
As some gay city in the air.  
On glittering gates, on ramparts raised  
By giant hands, the chieftains gazed.  
They saw the mighty hosts that, skilled  
In arts of war, the city filled,  
And ramparts with new ramparts lined,  
The swarthy hosts that stood behind.  
With spirits burning for the fight  
They saw the giants from the height,  
And from a hundred throats rang out  
Defiance and the battle shout.  
Then sank the sun with dying flame,  
And soft the shades of twilight came,  
And the full moon's delicious light  
Was shed upon the tranquil night.
