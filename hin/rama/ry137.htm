As thus Sumantra, best of peers,<BR>
Told his sad tale with many tears,<BR>
The monarch cried, 'I pray thee, tell<BR>
At length again what there befell.'<BR>
Sumantra, at the king's behest,<BR>
Striving with sobs he scarce repressed,<BR>
His trembling voice at last controlled,<BR>
And thus his further tidings told:<BR>
'Their locks in votive coils they wound,<BR>
Their coats of bark upon them bound,<BR>
To Gang&aacute;'s farther shore they went,<BR>
Thence to Pray&aacute;g their steps were bent.<BR>
I saw that Lakshman walked ahead<BR>
To guard the path the two should tread.<BR>
So far I saw, no more could learn,<BR>
Forced by the hero to return.<BR>
Retracing slow my homeward course,<BR>
Scarce could I move each stubborn horse:<BR>
Shedding hot tears of grief he stood<BR>
When R&aacute;ma turned him to the wood.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_333"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
As the two princes parted thence<BR>
I raised my hands in reverence,<BR>
Mounted my ready car, and bore<BR>
The grief that stung me to the core.<BR>
With Guha all that day I stayed,<BR>
Still by the earnest hope delayed<BR>
That R&aacute;ma, ere the time should end,<BR>
Some message from the wood might send.<BR>
Thy realms, great Monarch, mourn the blow,<BR>
And sympathize with R&aacute;ma's woe.<BR>

Each withering tree hangs low his head,<BR>
And shoot, and bud, and flower are dead.<BR>
Dried are the floods that wont to fill<BR>
The lake, the river, and the rill.<BR>
Drear is each grove and garden now,<BR>
Dry every blossom on the bough.<BR>
Each beast is still, no serpents crawl:<BR>
A lethargy of woe on all.<BR>
The very wood is silent: crushed<BR>
With grief for R&aacute;ma, all is hushed.<BR>
Fair blossoms from the water born,<BR>
Gay garlands that the earth adorn,<BR>
And every fruit that gleams like gold,<BR>
Have lost the scent that charmed of old.<BR>
Empty is every grove I see,<BR>
Or birds sit pensive on the tree.<BR>
Where'er I look, its beauty o'er,<BR>
The pleasance charms not as before.<BR>
I drove through fair Ayodhy&aacute;'s street:<BR>
None flew with joy the car to meet.<BR>
They saw that R&aacute;ma was not there,<BR>
And turned them sighing in despair.<BR>
The people in the royal way<BR>
Wept tears of bitter grief, when they<BR>
Beheld me coming, from afar,<BR>
No R&aacute;ma with me in the car.<BR>
From palace roof and turret high<BR>
Each woman bent her eager eye;<BR>
She looked for R&aacute;ma, but in vain;<BR>
Gazed on the car and shrieked for pain.<BR>
Their long clear eyes with sorrow drowned<BR>
They, when this common grief was found,<BR>
Looked each on other, friend and foe,<BR>
In sympathy of levelling woe:<BR>
No shade of difference between<BR>
Foe, friend, or neutral, there was seen.<BR>
Without a joy, her bosom rent<BR>
With grief for R&aacute;ma's banishment,<BR>
Ayodhy&aacute; like the queen appears<BR>
Who mourns her son with many tears.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ended: and the king, distressed.<BR>
With sobbing voice that lord addressed:<BR>
'Ah me, by false Kaikey&iacute; led,<BR>
Of evil race, to evil bred,<BR>
I took no counsel of the sage,<BR>
Nor sought advice from skill and age,<BR>
I asked no lord his aid to lend,<BR>
I called no citizen or friend.<BR>
Rash was my deed, bereft of sense<BR>
Slave to a woman's influence.<BR>
Surely, my lord, a woe so great<BR>
Palls on us by the will of Fate;<BR>
It lays the house of Raghu low,<BR>
For Destiny will have it so.<BR>
I pray thee, if I e'er have done<BR>
An act to please thee, yea, but one,<BR>
Fly, fly, and R&aacute;ma homeward lead:<BR>
My life, departing, counsels speed.<BR>
Fly, ere the power to bid I lack,<BR>
Fly to the wood: bring R&aacute;ma back.<BR>
I cannot live for even one<BR>
Short hour bereaved of my son.<BR>
But ah, the prince, whose arms are strong,<BR>
Has journeyed far: the way is long:<BR>
Me, me upon the chariot place,<BR>
And let me look on R&aacute;ma's face.<BR>
Ah me, my son, mine eldest-born,<BR>
Where roams he in the wood forlorn,<BR>
The wielder of the mighty bow,<BR>
Whose shoulders like the lion's show?<BR>
O, ere the light of life be dim,<BR>
Take me to S&iacute;t&aacute; and to him.<BR>
O R&aacute;ma, Lakshman, and O thou<BR>
Dear S&iacute;t&aacute;, constant to thy vow,<BR>
Beloved ones, you cannot know<BR>
That I am dying of my woe.'<BR>
&nbsp; The king to bitter grief a prey,<BR>
That drove each wandering sense away,<BR>
Sunk in affliction's sea. too wide<BR>
To traverse, in his anguish cried:<BR>
'Hard, hard to pass, my Queen, this sea<BR>
Of sorrow raging over me:<BR>
No R&aacute;ma near to soothe mine eye,<BR>
Plunged in its lowest deeps I lie.<BR>
Sorrow for R&aacute;ma swells the tide,<BR>
And S&iacute;t&aacute;'s absence makes it wide:<BR>
My tears its foamy flood distain,<BR>
Made billowy by my sighs of pain:<BR>
My cries its roar, the arms I throw<BR>
About me are the fish below,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; is the fire that feeds<BR>
Beneath: my hair the tangled weeds:<BR>
Its source the tears for R&aacute;ma shed:<BR>
The hump-back's words its monsters dread:<BR>
The boon I gave the wretch its shore,<BR>
Till R&aacute;ma's banishment be o'er. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_334"></A><A HREF="ry138.htm#fn_334"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ah me, that I should long to set<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    My eager eyes to-day<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  On Raghu's son, and he be yet<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With Lakshman far away!'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus he of lofty glory wailed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And sank upon the bed.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Beneath the woe his spirit failed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And all his senses fled.<BR>
