### CANTO CX.: RÁVAN'S DEATH.

Then Mátali to Ráma cried:  
'Let other arms the day decide.  
Why wilt thou strive with useless toil  
And see his might thy efforts foil?  
Launch at the foe thy dart whose fire  
Was kindled by the Almighty Sire.'  
He ceased: and Raghu's son obeyed:  
Upon his string the hero laid  
An arrow, like a snake that hissed.  
Whose fiery flight had never missed:  
The arrow Saint Agastya gave  
And blessed the chieftain's life to save  
That dart the Eternal Father made  
The Monarch of the Gods to aid;  
By Brahmá's self on him bestowed  
When forth to fight Lord Indra rode.  
'Twas feathered with the rushing wind;  
The glowing sun and fire combined  
To the keen point their splendour lent;  
The shaft, ethereal element,  
By Meru's hill and Mandar, pride  
Of mountains, had its weight supplied.  
He laid it on the twisted cord,  
He turned the point at Lanká's lord,  
And swift the limb-dividing dart  
Pierced the huge chest and cleft the heart,  
And dead he fell upon the plain  
Like Vritra by the Thunderer slain.  
The Rákahas host when Rávan fell  
Sent forth a wild terrific yell,  
Then turned and fled, all hope resigned,  
Through Lanká's gates, nor looked behind  
His voice each joyous Vánar raised,  
And Ráma, conquering Ráma, praised.  
Soft from celestial minstrels came  
The sound of music and acclaim.  
Soft, fresh, and cool, a rising breeze  
Brought odours from the heavenly trees,  
And ravishing the sight and smell  
A wondrous rain of blossoms fell:  
And voices breathed round Raghu's son:  
'Champion of Gods, well done, well done.'
