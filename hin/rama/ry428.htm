<P>
The giant viewed with earnest ken<BR>
The V&aacute;nars and the lords of men;<BR>
Then thus, with grief and anger moved,<BR>
In bitter tone the spies reproved:<BR>
'Can faithful servants hope to please<BR>
Their master with such fates as these?<BR>
Or hope ye with wild words to wring<BR>
The bosom of your lord and king?<BR>
Such words were better said by those<BR>
Who come arrayed our mortal foes.<BR>
In vain your ears have heard the sage,<BR>
And listened to the lore of age,<BR>
Untaught, though lectured many a day,<BR>
The first great lesson, to obey,<BR>
'Tis marvel R&aacute;van reigns and rules<BR>
Whose counsellors are blind and fools.<BR>
Has death no terrors that ye dare<BR>
To tempt your monarch to despair,<BR>

<P>
From whose Imperial mandate flow<BR>
Disgrace and honour, weal and woe?<BR>
Yea, forest trees, when flames are fanned<BR>
About their scorching trunks, may stand;<BR>
But naught can set the sinner free<BR>
When kings the punishment decree.<BR>
I would not in mine anger spare<BR>
The traitorous foe-praising pair,<BR>
But years of faithful service plead<BR>
For pardon, and they shall not bleed.<BR>
Henceforth to me be dead: depart,<BR>
Far from my presence and my heart.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spoke the angry king: the two<BR>
Cried, Long live R&aacute;van, and withdrew,<BR>
The giant monarch turned and cried<BR>
To strong Mahodar at his side:<BR>
'Go thou, and spies more faithful bring.<BR>
More duteous to their lord the king.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Swift at his word Mahodar shed,<BR>
And came returning at the head<BR>
Of long tried messengers, who bent<BR>
Before their monarch reverent.<BR>
'Go quickly hence,' said R&aacute;van 'scan<BR>
With keenest eyes the foeman's plan.<BR>
Learn who, as nearest friends, advise<BR>
And mould each secret enterprise.<BR>
Learn when he wakes and goes to rest,<BR>
Sound every purpose of his breast.<BR>
Learn what the prince intends to-day:<BR>
Watch keenly all, and come away.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With joy they heard the words he said:<BR>
Then with S'&aacute;rd&uacute;la at their head<BR>
About the giant king they went<BR>
With circling paces reverent.<BR>
By fair Suvela's grassy side<BR>
The chiefs of Raghu's race they spied,<BR>
Where, shaded by the waving wood,<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan and Sugr&iacute;va stood.<BR>
A while they rested there and viewed<BR>
The V&aacute;nars' countless multitude.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan with observant eyes<BR>
Knew at a glance the giant spies,<BR>
And bade the warriors of his train<BR>
Bind the rash foes with cord and chain:<BR>
'S'&aacute;rd&uacute;la's is the sin,' he cried.<BR>
He neath the V&aacute;nars' hands had died,<BR>
But R&aacute;ma from their fury freed<BR>
The captive in his utmost need,<BR>
And, merciful at sight of woe,<BR>
Loosed all the spies and bade them go.<BR>
Then home to Lank&aacute;'s monarch fled<BR>
The giant chiefs discomfited.<BR>
