Then came the vultures' mighty king<BR>
Where sat the V&aacute;nars sorrowing,--<BR>
Samp&aacute;ti, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_763"></A><A HREF="#fn_763"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> best of birds that fly<BR>
On sounding pinions through the sky,<BR>
Jat&aacute;yus' brother, famed of old,<BR>
Most glorious and strong and bold.<BR>
Upon the slope of Vindhya's hill<BR>
He saw the V&aacute;nars calm and still.<BR>

<P>
These words he uttered while the sight<BR>
Filled his fierce spirit with delight:<BR>
'Behold how Fate with changeless laws<BR>
Within his toils the sinner draws,<BR>
And brings me, after long delay,<BR>
A rich and noble feast to-day,<BR>
These V&aacute;nars who are doomed to die<BR>
My hungry maw to satisfy.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke no more: and Angad heard<BR>
The menace of the mighty bird;<BR>
And thus, while anguish filled his breast,<BR>
The noble Hanum&aacute;n addressed:<BR>
'Vivasvat's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_764"></A><A HREF="#fn_764"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> son has sought this place<BR>
For vengeance on the V&aacute;nar race.<BR>
See, Yama, wroth for S&iacute;t&aacute;'s sake,<BR>
Is come our guilty lives to take.<BR>
Our king's decree is left undone,<BR>
And naught achieved for Raghu's son.<BR>
In duty have we failed, and hence<BR>
Comes punishment for dire offence.<BR>
Have we not heard the marvels wrought<BR>
By King Jat&aacute;yus, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_765"></A><A HREF="#fn_765"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> how he fought<BR>
With R&aacute;van's might, and, nobly brave,<BR>
Perished, the Maithil queen to save?<BR>
There is no living creature, none,<BR>
But loves to die for Raghu's son,<BR>
And in long toils and dangers we<BR>
Have placed our lives in jeopardy<BR>
Blest is Jat&aacute;yus, he who gave<BR>
His life the Maithil queen to save,<BR>
And proved his love for R&aacute;ma well<BR>
When by the giant's hand he fell<BR>
Now raised to bliss and high renown<BR>
He fears not fierce Sugr&iacute;va's frown.<BR>
Alas, alas! what miseries spring<BR>
From that rash promise of the king! &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_766"></A><A HREF="#fn_766"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
His own sad death, and R&aacute;ma sent<BR>
With Lakshman forth to banishment:<BR>
The Maithil lady borne away:<BR>
Jat&aacute;yus slain in mortal fray:<BR>
The fall of B&aacute;li when the dart<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma quivered in his heart:<BR>
And, after toil and pain and care,<BR>
Our misery and deep despair.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: the feathered monarch heard,<BR>
His heart with ruth and wonder stirred:<BR>
'Whose is that voice,' the vulture cried,<BR>
'That tells me how Jat&aacute;yus died,<BR>
And shakes my inmost soul with woe<BR>
For a loved brother's overthrow?<BR>
After long days at length I hear<BR>
The glorious name of one so dear.<BR>
Once more, O V&aacute;nar chieftains, tell<BR>
How King Jat&aacute;yus fought and fell.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
But first your aid, I pray you, lend,<BR>
And from this peak will I descend.<BR>
The sun has burnt my wings, and I<BR>
No longer have the power to fly.'<BR>
