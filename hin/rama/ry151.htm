<P>
But when he heard the queen relate<BR>
His brothers' doom, his father's fate,<BR>
Thus Bharat to his mother said<BR>
With burning grief disquieted:<BR>

'Alas, what boots it now to reign,<BR>
Struck down by grief and well-nigh slain?<BR>
Ah, both are gone, my sire, and he<BR>
Who was a second sire to me.<BR>
Grief upon grief thy hand has made,<BR>
And salt upon gashes laid:<BR>
For my dear sire has died through thee,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma roams a devotee.<BR>
Thou camest like the night of Fate<BR>
This royal house to devastate.<BR>
Unwitting ill, my hapless sire<BR>
Placed in his bosom coals of fire,<BR>
And through thy crimes his death he met,<BR>
O thou whose heart on sin is set.<BR>
Shame of thy house! thy senseless deed<BR>
Has reft all joy from Raghu's seed.<BR>
The truthful monarch, dear to fame,<BR>
Received thee as his wedded dame,<BR>
And by thy act to misery doomed<BR>
Has died by flames of grief consumed.<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; and Sumitr&aacute; too<BR>
The coming of my mother rue.<BR>
And if they live oppressed by woe,<BR>
For their dear sons their sad tears flow.<BR>
Was he not ever good and kind,--<BR>
That hero of the duteous mind?<BR>
Skilled in all filial duties, he<BR>
As a dear mother treated thee.<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; too, the eldest queen,<BR>
Who far foresees with insight keen,<BR>
Did she not ever show thee all<BR>
A sister's love at duty's call?<BR>
And hast thou from the kingdom chased<BR>
Her son, with bark around his waist,<BR>
To the wild wood, to dwell therein,<BR>
And dost not sorrow for thy sin?<BR>
The love bare to Raghu's son<BR>
Thou knewest not, ambitious one,<BR>
If thou hast wrought this impious deed<BR>
For royal sway, in lawless greed.<BR>
With him and Lakshman far away,<BR>
What power have I the realm to sway?<BR>
What hope will fire my bosom when<BR>
I see no more these lords of men?<BR>
The holy king who loved the right<BR>
Relied on R&aacute;ma's power and might,<BR>
His guardian and his glory, so<BR>
(<I>illegible</I>) Meru in his woods below.<BR>
How can I bear, a steer untrained,<BR>
The load his mightier strength sustained?<BR>
What power have I to brook alone<BR>
This weight on feeble shoulders thrown?<BR>
For if the needful power were bought<BR>
By strength of mind and brooding thought,<BR>
No triumph shall attend the dame<BR>
Who dooms her son to lasting shame.<BR>
Now should no doubt that son prevent<BR>
From quitting thee on evil bent.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma's love o'erpowers my will,<BR>
Who holds thee as his mother still.<BR>
Whence did the thought, O thou whose eyes<BR>
Are turned to sinful deeds, arise--<BR>
A plan our ancient sires would hate,<BR>
O fallen from thy virtuous state?<BR>
For in the line from which we spring<BR>
The eldest is anointed king:<BR>
No monarchs from the rule decline,<BR>
And, least of all. lkshv&aacute;ku's line.<BR>
Our holy sires, to virtue true,<BR>
Upon our race a lustre threw,<BR>
But with subversive frenzy thou<BR>
Hast marred our lineal honour now,<BR>
Of lofty birth, a noble line<BR>
Of previous kings is also thine:<BR>
Then whence this hated folly? whence<BR>
This sudden change that steals thy sense?<BR>
Thou shalt not gain thine impious will,<BR>
O thou whose thoughts are bent on ill,<BR>
Thou from whose guilty hand descend<BR>
These sinful blows my life to end.<BR>
Now to the forest will I go,<BR>
Thy cherished plans to overthrow,<BR>
And bring my brother, free from stain,<BR>
His people's darling, home again,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, when again he turns,<BR>
Whose glory like a beacon burns,<BR>
In me a faithful slave shall find<BR>
To serve him with contented mind.'<BR>
