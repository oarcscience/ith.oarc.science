### CANTO XLVIII.: THE WOMEN'S LAMENT.

When those who forth with Ráma went  
Back to the town their steps had bent,  
It seemed that death had touched and chilled  
Those hearts which piercing sorrow filled.  
Each to his several mansion came,  
And girt by children and his dame,  
From his sad eyes the water shed  
That o'er his cheek in torrents spread.  
All joy was fled: oppressed with cares  
No bustling trader showed his wares.  
Each shop had lost its brilliant look,  
Each householder forbore to cook.  
No hand with joy its earnings told,  
None cared to win a wealth of gold,  
And scarce the youthful mother smiled  
To see her first, her new-born child.  
In every house a woman wailed,  
And her returning lord assailed  
With keen taunt piercing like the steel  
That bids the tusked monster kneel;  
'What now to them is wedded dame,  
What house and home and dearest aim,  
Or son, or bliss, or gathered store,  
Whose eyes on Ráma look no more!  
There is but one in all the earth,  
One man alone of real worth,  
Lakshman, who follows, true and good,  
Ráma, with Sítá, through the wood,  
Made holy for all time we deem  
Each pool and fountain, lake and stream,  
If great Kakutstha's son shall choose  
Their water for his bath to use.  
Each forest, dark with lovely trees,  
Shall yearn Kakutstha's son to please;  
Each mountain peak and woody hill,  
Each mighty flood and mazy rill,  
Each rocky height, each shady grove  
Where the blest feet of Ráma rove,  
Shall gladly welcome with the best  
Of all they have their honoured guest.  
The trees that clustering blossoms bear,  
And bright-hued buds to gem their hair,  
The heart of Ráma shall delight,  
And cheer him on the breezy height.  
For him the upland slopes will show  
The fairest roots and fruit that grow,  
And all their wealth before him fling  
Ere the due hour of ripening.  
For him each earth-upholding hill  
Its crystal water shall distil,  
And all its floods shall be displayed  
In many a thousand-hued cascade.  
Where Ráma stands is naught to fear,  
No danger comes if he be near;  
For all who live on him depend,  
The world's support, and lord, and friend.  
Ere in too distant wilds he stray,  
Let us to Ráma speed away,  
For rich reward on those will wait  
Who serve a prince of soul so great.  
We will attend on Sítá there;  
Be Raghu's son your special care.'  
The city dames, with grief distressed,  
Thus once again their lords addressed:  
'Ráma shall be your guard and guide,  
And Sítá will for us provide.  
For who would care to linger here,  
Where all is sad and dark and drear?  
Who, mid the mourners, hope for bliss  
ln a poor soulless town like this?  
If Queen Kaikeyí's treacherous sin,  
Our lord expelled, the kingdom win,  
We heed not sons or golden store,  
Our life itself we prize no more.  
If she, seduced by lust of sway,  
Her lord and son could cast away,  
Whom would she leave unharmed, the base  
Defiler of her royal race?  
We swear it by our children dear,  
We will not dwell as servants here;  
If Queen Kaikeyí live to reign,  
We will not in her realm remain.  
Bowed down by her oppressive hand,  
The helpless, lordless, godless land,  
Cursed for Kaikeyí's guilt will fall,  
And swift destruction seize it all.

For, Ráma forced from home to fly,  
The king his sire will surely die,  
And when the king has breathed his last  
Ruin will doubtless follow fast.  
Sad, robbed of merits, drug the cup  
And drink the poisoned mixture up,  
Or share the exiled Ráma's lot,  
Or seek some land that knows her not.  
No reason, but a false pretence  
Drove Ráma, Sitá, Lakshman hence,  
And we to Bharat have been given  
Like cattle to the shambles driven.  

While in each house the women, pained  
At loss of Ráma, still complained,  
Sank to his rest the Lord of Day,  
And night through all the sky held sway  
The tires of worship all were cold,  
No text was hummed, no tale was told,  
And shades of midnight gloom came down  
Eveloping the mournful town.  
Still, sick at heart, the women shed,  
As for a son or husband fled,  
For Ráma tears, disquieted:  

No child was loved as he.  
And all Ayodhyá, where the feast,  
Music, and song, and dance had ceased,  
   And merriment and glee,  
Where every merchant's store was closed  
That erst its glittering wares exposed,  
Was like a dried up sea.
