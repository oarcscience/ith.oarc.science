<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXIII.: KABANDHA'S COUNSEL.</H3>
<P>
The monster ceased: the princely pair<BR>
Heard great Kabandha's eager prayer.<BR>
Within a mountain cave they sped,<BR>
Where kindled fire with care they fed.<BR>
Then Lakshman in his mighty hands<BR>
Brought ample store of lighted brands,<BR>
And to a pile of logs applied<BR>
The flame that ran from side to side.<BR>
The spreading glow with gentle force<BR>
Consumed Kabundha's mighty corse,<BR>
Till the unresting flames had drunk<BR>
The marrow of the monstrous trunk,<BR>
As balls of butter melt away<BR>
Amid the fires that o'er them play.<BR>
Then from the pyre, like flame that glows<BR>
Undimmed by cloudy smoke, he rose,<BR>
In garments pure of spot or speck,<BR>
A heavenly wreath about his neck.<BR>
Resplendent in his bright attire<BR>
He sprang exultant from the pyre.<BR>
While from neck, arm, and foot was sent<BR>
The flash of gold and ornament.<BR>
High on a chariot, bright of hue,<BR>
Which swans of fairest pinion drew,<BR>
He filled each region of the air<BR>
With splendid glow reflected there,<BR>
Then in the sky he stayed his car<BR>
And called to R&aacute;ma from afar:<BR>
'Hear, chieftain, while my lips explain<BR>
The means to win thy spouse again.<BR>
Six plans, O prince, the wise pursue<BR>
To reach the aims we hold in view.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_520"></A><A HREF="#fn_520"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
When evils ripening sorely press,<BR>
They load the wretch with new distress.<BR>
So thou and Lakshman, tried by woe,<BR>
Have felt at last a fiercer blow,<BR>
And plunged in bitterest grief to-day<BR>
Lament thy consort torn away.<BR>
There is no course but this: attend;<BR>

<P>

<P>
Make, best of friends, that chief thy friend.<BR>
Unless his prospering help thou gain<BR>
Thy plans and hopes must all be vain.<BR>
O R&aacute;ma, hear my words, and seek,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, for of him I speak.<BR>
His brother B&aacute;li, Indra's son,<BR>
Expelled him when the fight was won.<BR>
With four great chieftains, faithful still,<BR>
He dwells on Rishyam&uacute;ka's hill.--<BR>
Fair mountain, lovely with the flow<BR>
Of Pamp&aacute;'s waves that glide below,--<BR>
Lord of the V&aacute;nars &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_521"></A><A HREF="#fn_521"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> just and true,<BR>
Strong, very glorious, bright to view,<BR>
Unmatched in counsel, firm and meek,<BR>
Bound by each word his lips may speak,<BR>
Good, splendid, mighty, bold and brave,<BR>
Wise in each plan to guide and save,<BR>
His brother, fired by lust of sway,<BR>
Drove forth the prince in woods to stray.<BR>
In all thy search for S&iacute;t&aacute; he<BR>
Thy ready friend and help will be.<BR>
With him to aid thee in thy quest<BR>
Dismiss all sorrow from thy breast.<BR>
Time is a mighty power, and none<BR>
His fixed decree can change or shun.<BR>
So rich reward thy toil shall bless,<BR>
And naught can stay thy sure success.<BR>
Speed hence, O chief, without delay,<BR>
To strong Sugr&iacute;va take thy way.<BR>
This hour thy footsteps onward bend,<BR>
And make that mighty prince thy friend.<BR>
With him before the attesting flame<BR>
In solemn truth alliance frame.<BR>
Nor wilt thou, if thy heart be wise,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, V&aacute;nar king, despise.<BR>
Of boundless strength, all shapes he wears,<BR>
He hearkens to a suppliant's prayers,<BR>
And, grateful for each kindly deed,<BR>
Will help and save in hour of need,<BR>
And you, I ween, the power possess<BR>
To aid his hopes and give redress.<BR>
He, let his cause succeed or fail,<BR>
Will help you, and you must prevail.<BR>
A banished prince, in fear and woe<BR>
He roams where Pamp&aacute;'s waters flow,<BR>
True offspring of the Lord of Light<BR>
Expelled by B&aacute;li's conquering might.<BR>
Go, Raghu's son, that chieftain seek<BR>
Who dwells on Rishyam&uacute;ka's peak.<BR>
Before the flame thy weapons cast<BR>
And bind the bonds of friendship fast.<BR>
For, prince of all the V&aacute;nar race,<BR>
He in his wisdom knows each place<BR>
Where dwell the fierce gigantic brood<BR>
Who make the flesh of man their food.<BR>
To him, O Raghu's son, to him<BR>
Naught in the world is dark or dim,<BR>
Where'er the mighty Day-God gleams<BR>
Resplendent with a thousand beams.<BR>

<P>
He over rocky height and hill,<BR>
Through gloomy cave, by lake and rill,<BR>
Will with his V&aacute;nars seek the prize,<BR>
And tell thee where thy lady lies.<BR>
And he will send great chieftains forth<BR>
To east and west and south and north,<BR>
To seek the distant spot where she<BR>
All desolate laments for thee.<BR>
He even in R&aacute;van's halls would find<BR>
Thy S&iacute;t&aacute;, gem of womankind.<BR>
Yea, if the blameless lady lay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    On Meru's loftiest steep.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Or, far removed from light of day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Where hell is dark and deep,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That chief of all the V&aacute;nar race<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    His way would still explore,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Meet the cowed giants face to face<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And thy dear spouse restore."<BR>
