<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLI.: M&Aacute;R&Iacute;CHA'S REPLY.</H3>
<P>
Against his judgment sorely pressed<BR>
By his imperious lord's behest,<BR>
M&aacute;r&iacute;cha threats of death defied<BR>
And thus with bitter words replied:<BR>
'Ah, who, my King, with sinful thought<BR>
This wild and wicked counsel taught,<BR>
By which destruction soon will fall<BR>
On thee, thy sons, thy realm and all?<BR>
Who is the guilty wretch who sees<BR>
With envious eye thy blissful ease,<BR>
And by this plan, so falsely shown,<BR>
Death's gate for thee has open thrown!<BR>
With souls impelled by mean degire<BR>
Thy foes against thy life conspire.<BR>
They urge thee to destruction's brink,<BR>
And gladly would they see thee sink.<BR>
Who with base thought to work thee woe<BR>
This fatal road has dared to show,<BR>
And, triumph in his wicked eye,<BR>
Would see thee enter io and die!<BR>
To all thy counsellors, untrue,<BR>
The punishment of death is due,<BR>
Who see thee tempt the dangerous way,<BR>
Nor strain each nerve thy foot to stay.<BR>
Wise lords, whose king, by passion led,<BR>
The path of sin begins to tread,<BR>
Restrain him while there yet is time:<BR>
But thine,--they see nor heed the crime.<BR>
These by their master's will obtain<BR>
Mirit and fame and joy and gain.<BR>
"Tis only by their master's grace<BR>
That servaits hold their lofty place.<BR>
But when tbc monarch stoops to sin<BR>
They lose each joy they strive to win,<BR>
And all the people people high and low<BR>
Fall in the common overthrow.<BR>

Merit and fame and honour spring,<BR>
Best of the mighty, from the king.<BR>
So all should strive with heart and will<BR>
To keep the king from every ill.<BR>
Pride, violence, and sullen hate<BR>
Will ne'er maintain a monarch's state,<BR>
And those who cruel deeds advise<BR>
Must perish when their master dies,<BR>
Like drivers with their cars o'erthrown<BR>
In places rough with root and stone.<BR>
The good whose holy lives were spent<BR>
On duty's highest laws intent,<BR>
With wives and children many a time<BR>
Have perished for another's crime.<BR>
Hapless are they whose sovereign lord,<BR>
Opposed to all, by all abhorred,<BR>
Is cruel-hearted, harsh, severe:<BR>
Thus might a jackal tend the deer.<BR>
Now all the giant race await,<BR>
Destroyed by thee, a speedy fate,<BR>
Ruled by a king so cruel-souled,<BR>
Foolish in heart and uncontrolled.<BR>
Think not I fear the sudden blow<BR>
That threatens now to lay me low:<BR>
I mourn the ruin that I see<BR>
Impending o'er thy host and thee.<BR>
Me first perchance will R&aacute;ma kill,<BR>
But soon his hand thy blood will spill.<BR>
I die, and if by R&aacute;ma slain<BR>
And not by thee, I count it gain.<BR>
Soon as the hero's face I see<BR>
His angry eyes will murder me,<BR>
And if on her thy hands thou lay<BR>
Thy friends and thou are dead this day.<BR>
If with my help thou still must dare<BR>
The lady from her lord to tear,<BR>
Farewell to all our days are o'er,<BR>
Lank&aacute; and giants are no more.<BR>
In vain, in vain, an earnest friend,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I warn thee, King, and pray.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thou wilt not to my prayers attend,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Or heed the words I say<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  So men when life is fleeting fast<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And death's sad hour is nigh,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Heedless and blinded to the last<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Reject advice and die.'<BR>
