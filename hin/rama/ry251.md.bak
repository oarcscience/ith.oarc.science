### CANTO LIII.: SITÁ'S THREATS.

Soon as the Maithil lady knew  
That high through air the giant flew,  
Distressed with grief and sore afraid  
Her troubled spirit sank dismayed.  
Then, as anew the waters welled  
From those red eyes which sorrow swelled,  
Fresh in keen words her passion broke,  
And to the fierce-eyed fiend she spoke:  

'Canst thou attempt a deed so base.  
Untroubled by the deep disgrace.--  
To steal me from my home and fly,  
When friend or guardian none was nigh!  
Thy craven soul that longed to steal,  
Fearing the blows that warriors deal.  
Upon a magic deer relied  
To lure my husband from my side,  
Friend of his sire, the vulture king  
Lies low on earth with mangled wing,  
Who gave his aged life for me  
And died for her he sought to free.  
Ah, glorious strength indeed is thine,  
Thou meanest of thy giant line,  
Whose courage dared to tell thy name  
And conquer in the fight a dame.  
Does the vile deed that thou hast done  
Cause thee no shame, thou wicked one--  
A woman from her home to rend  
When none was near his aid to lend?  
Through all the worlds, O giant King,  
The tidings of this deed will ring,  
This deed in law and honour's spite  
By one who claims a hero's might.  
Shame on thy boasted valour, shame!  
Thy prowess is an empty name,  
Shame, giant, on this cursed deed  
For which thy race is doomed to bleed!  
Thou fliest swifter than the gale,  
For what can strength like thine avail?  
Stay for one hour, O Rávan, stay;  
Thou shalt not flee with life away.  
Soon as the royal chieftains' sight  
Falls on the thief who roams by night,  
Thou wilt not, tyrant, live one hour  
Though backed by all thy legions' power,  
Ne'er can thy puny strength sustain  
The tempest of their arrowy rain:  
Have e'er the trembling birds withstood  
The wild flames raging in the wood?  
Hear me, O Rávan, let me go,  
And save thy soul from coming woe.  
Or if thou wilt not not me free,  
Wroth for this insult done to me.  
With his brave brother's aid my lord  
Against thy life will raise his sword.  
A guilty hope inflames thy breast  
His wife from Ráma's home to wrest.  
Ah fool, the hope thou hast is vain;  
Thy dreams of bliss shall end in pain!  
If torn from all I love by thee  
Mv godlike lord no more I see,  
Soon will I die and end my woes,  
Nor live the captive of my foes,.  
Ah fool, with blinded eyes to choose  
The evil and the good refuse!  
So the sick wretch with stubborn will  
Turns fondly to the \*\*cates that kill,  
And madly draws his lips away  
From medicine that would check decay.  
About thy neck securely wound  

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>  

The deadly coil of Fate is bound,  
And thou, O Ravan, dost not fear  
Although the hour of death is near.  
With death-doomed sight thine eyes behold  
The gleaming of the trees of gold,--  
See dread Vaitarani, the flood  
Thatt rolls a stream of foamy blood,--  
See the dark wood by all abhorred--  
Its every leaf a threatening sword.  
The tangled thickets thou shall tread  
Where thorns with iron points are spread,  
For never can thy days be long,  
Base plotter of this shame and wrong  
To Ráma of ihe lofty soul:  
He dies who drinks the poisoned bowl.  
The coils of death around thee lie:  
They hold thee and thou canst not fly.  
Ah whither, tyrant, wouldst thou run  
The vengeance of my lord to shun?  
By his unaided arm alone  
Were twice seven thousand fiends o'er-thrown:  
Yes, in the twinkling of an eye  
He forced thy mightiest fiends to die.  
And shall that lord of lion heart,  
Skilled in the bow and spear and dart,  
Spare thee, O fiend, in battle strife,  
The robber of his darling wife?'  
   These were her words, and more beside,  
By wrath and bitter hate supplied.  
Then by her woe and fear o'erthrown  
She wept again and made her moan.  
As long she wept in grief and dread,  
Scarce conscious of the words she said,  
The wicked giant onward fled  
   And bore her through the air.  
As firm he held the Maithil dame,  
Still wildly struggling, o'er her frame  
With grief and bitter misery came  
   The trembling of despair.
