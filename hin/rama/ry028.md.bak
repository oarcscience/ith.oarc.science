### CANTO XXVI.: THE FOREST OF TÁDAKÁ.

When the fair light of morning rose  
The princely turners of their foes  
Followed, his morning worship o'er,  
The hermit to the river's shore.  
The high-souled men with thoughtful care  
A pretty barge had stationed there.  
All cried. 'O lord, this barge ascend,  
And with thy princely followers bend  
To yonder side thy prosperous way  
With naught to check thee or delay.'  

Nor did the saint their rede reject:  
He bade farewell with due respect,  
And crossed, attended by the twain,  
That river rushing to the main.  
When now the bark was half way o'er,  
Ráma and Lakshman heard the roar,  

That louder grew and louder yet,  
Of waves by dashing waters met.  
Then Ráma asked the mighty seer:  
'What is the tumult that I hear  
Of waters cleft in mid career?'  
Soon as the speech of Ráma, stirred  
By deep desire to know, he heard,  
The pious saint began to tell  
What paused the waters' roar and swell:  
'On high Kailása's distant hill  
   There lies a noble lake  
Whose waters, born from Brahmá's will,  
   The name of Mánas <span id="fr_157"></span>[1b](#fn_157.md) take.  
Thence, hallowing where'er they flow,  
   The streams of Sarjú fall,  
And wandering through the plains below  
   Embrace Ayodhyá's wall.  
Still, still preserved in Sarjú's name  
   Sarovar's <span id="fr_158"></span>[2b](#fn_158.md) fame we trace.  
The flood of Brahma whence she came  
   To run her holy race.  
To meet great Gangá here she hies  
   With tributary wave:  
Hence the loud roar ye hear arise,  
   Of floods that swell and rave.  
Here, pride of Raghu's line, do thou  
In humble adoration bow.'  

He spoke. The princes both obeyed,  
And reverence to each river paid. <span
id="fr_159"></span>[3b](#fn_159.md)  
They reached the southern shore at last,  
And gaily on their journey passed.  
A little space beyond there stood  
A gloomy awe-inspiring wood.  
The monarch's noble son began  
To question thus the holy man:  
'Whose gloomy forest meets mine eye  
Like some vast cloud that fills the sky?  
Pathless and dark it seems to be,  
Where birds in thousands wander free;  
Where shrill cicadas' cries resound,  

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>  

And fowl of dismal note abound,  
Lion, rhinoceros, and bear,  
Boar, tiger, elephant, are there,  
   There shrubs and thorns run wild:  
Dháo, Sál, Bignonia, Bel, <span id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_160.md) are
found,  
And every tree that grows on ground.  
   How is the forest styled?'  
The glorious saint this answer made:  
   'Dear child of Raghu, hear  
Who dwells within the horrid shade  
   That looks so dark and drear.  
Where now is wood, long ere this day  
   Two broad and fertile lands,  
Malaja and Karúsha lay.  
   Adorned by heavenly hands.  
Here, mourning friendship's broken ties,  
Lord Indra of the thousand eyes  
Hungered and sorrowed many a day,  
His brightness soiled with mud and clay,  
When in a storm of passion he  
Had slain his dear friend Namuchi.  
Then came the Gods and saints who bore  
Their golden pitchers brimming o'er  
With holy streams that banish stain,  
And bathed Lord Indra pure again.  
When in this land the God was freed  
From spot and stain of impious deed  
For that his own dear friend he slew,  
High transport thrilled his bosom through.  
Then in his joy the lands he blessed,  
And gave a boon they long possessed:  
'Because these fertile lands retain  
The washings of the blot and stain,'  
   'Twas thus Lord Indra sware,  
'Malaja and Karúsha's name  
Shall celebrate with deathless fame  
   My malady and care.' <span id="fr_161"></span>[2](#fn_161.md)  
'So be it', all the Immortals cried,  
   When Indra's speech they heard,  
And with acclaim they ratified  
   The names his lips conferred.  
Long time, O victor of thy foes,  
These happy lands had sweet repose,  
And higher still in fortune rose.  
At length a spirit, loving ill,  
Tádaká , wearing shapes at will,  

Whose mighty strength, exceeding vast  
A thousand elephants, surpassed,  
Was to fierce Sunda, lord and head  
Of all the demon armies, wed.  
From her, Lord Indra's peer in might  
Giant Máricha sprang to light:  
And she, a constant plague and pest,  
These two fair realms has long distressed.  
Now dwelling in her dark abode  
A league away she bars the road:  
And we, O Ráma, hence must go  
Where lies the forest of the foe.  
Now on thine own right arm rely,  
   And my command obey:  
Smite the foul monster that she die.  
   And take the plague away.  
To reach this country none may dare  
   Fallen from its old estate,  
Which she, whose fury naught can bear,  
   Has left so desolate.  
And now my truthful tale is told  
   How with accursed sway  
The spirit plagued this wood of old,  
   And ceases not to-day.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_156"></span>[38:1](ry027.htm#fr_156.md) *The Bodiless one.*

<span id="fn_157"></span>[38:1b](ry028.htm#fr_157.md) 'A celebrated lake
regarded in India as sacred. It lies in the lofty region between the
northern highlands of the Himalayas and mount Kailása, the region of the
sacred lakes. The poem, following the popular Indian belief, makes the
river Sarayú (now Sarjú) flow from the Mánasa lake; the sources of the
river are a little to the south about a day's journey from the lake. See
Lassen, *Indische Alterthumsbunde*, page 34.' GORBESIO. *Manas* means
mind; *mánasa*, mental, mind-born.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[38:2b](ry028.htm#fr_158.md) *Sarovar* means best
of lakes. This is another of the poet's fanciful etymologies.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[38:3b](ry028.htm#fr_159.md) The confluence of two
or more rivers is often a venerated and holy place. The most famous is
Prayág or Allahabad, where the Sarasvatí by an underground course is
believed to join the Jumna and the Ganges.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[39:1](ry028.htm#fr_160.md) The botanical names of
the trees mentioned in the text are Grislea Tormentosa, Shorea Robusta,
Echites Antidysenterica, Bignonia Suaveolens, Aegle Marmelos, and
Diospyrus Glutinosa. I have omitted the *Kutaja* (Echites) and the
*Tinduka* (Diospyrus).

<span id="fn_161"></span>[39:2](ry028.htm#fr_161.md) Here we meet with a
fresh myth to account for the name of these regions. *Malaja* is
probably a non-Aryan word signifying a hilly country: taken as a
Sanskrit compound it means *sprung from defilement*. The word *Karúsha*
appears to have a somewhat similar meaning.
