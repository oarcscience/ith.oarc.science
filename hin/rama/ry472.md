### CANTO XCIII.: RÁVAN'S LAMENT.

They sought the king, a mournful train,  
And cried. 'My lord, thy son is slain.  
By Lakshmau's hand, before these eyes,  
The warrior fell no more to rise.  
No time is this for vain regret:  
Thy hero son a hero met;  
And he whose might in battle pressed  
Lord Indra and the Gods confessed,  
Whose power was stranger to defeat,  
Has gained in heaven a blissful seat.  

The monarch heard the mournful tale:  
His heart was faint, his cheek was pale;  
His fleeting sense at length regained,  
In trembling tones he thus complained:  
'Ah me, my son, my pride: the boast  
And glory of the giant host.  
Could Lakshman's puny might defeat  
The foe whom Indra feared to meet?  
Could not thy deadly arrows split  
Proud Mandar's peaks, O Indrajit,  

And the Destroyer's self destroy?  
And wast thou conquered by a boy?  
I will not weep: thy noble deed  
Has blessed thee with immortal meed  
Gained by each hero in the skies  
Who fighting for his sovereign dies.  
Now, fearless of all meaner foes.  
The guardian Gods  <span id="fr_1011"></span>[1b](#fn_1011.md) will taste
repose:  
But earth to me, with hill and plain,  
In\* desolate, for thou art slain.  
Ah, whither hast thou fled, and left  
Thy mother, Lanká, me bereft;  
Left pride and state and wives behind,  
And lordship over all thy kind?  
I fondly hoped thy hand should pay  
Due honours on my dying day:  
And couldst thou, O beloved, flee  
And leave thy funeral rites to me?  
Life has no comfort left me, none,  
O Indrajit my son, my son.'  

Thus wailed he broken by his woes:  
But swift the thought of vengeance rose.  
In awful wrath his teeth he gnashed,  
And from his eyes red lightning flashed.  
Hot from his mouth came fire and smoke,  
As thus the king in fury spoke:  

'Through many a thousand years of yore  
The penance and the pain I bore,  
And by fierce torment well sustained  
The highest grace of Brahmá, gained,  
His plighted word my life assured,  
From Gods of heaven and fiends secured.  
He armed my limbs with burnished mail  
Whose lustre turns the sunbeams pale,  
In battle proof gainst heavenly bands  
With thunder in their threatening hands.  
Armed in this mail myself will go  
With Brahmá's gift my deadly bow,  
And, cleaving through the foes my way,  
The slayers of my son will slay.'  

Then, by his grief to frenzy wrought,  
The captive in the grove he sought.  
Swift through the shady path he sped:  
Earth trembled at his furious tread.  
Fierce were his eyes: his monstrous hand  
Held drawn for death his glittering brand.  

<span id="page_488">p. 488</span>  

There weeping stood the Maithil dame:  
She shuddered as the giant came.  
Near drew the rover of the night  
And raised his sword in act to smite;  
But, by his nobler heart impelled,  
One Rákshas lord his arm withheld:  
'Wilt thou, great Monarch,' thus he cried,  
'Wilt thou, to heavenly Gods allied,  
Blot for all time thy glorious fame,  
The slayer of a gentle dame?  
What! shall a woman's blood be spilt  
To stain thee with eternal guilt,  
Thee deep in all the Veda's lore?  
Far be the thought for evermore.  
Ah look, and let her lovely face  
This fury from thy bosom chase.'  

He ceased: the prudent counsel pleased  
The monarch, and his wrath appeased;  
Then to his council hall in haste  
The giant lord his steps retraced.  <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1010"></span>[487:1](ry471.htm#fr_1010.md) I have briefly
despatched Kumbha and Nikumbha, each of whom has in the text a long
Canto to himself. When they fall Rávan sends forth Makaráksha or
Crocodile-Eye, the son of Khara who was slain by Ráma in the forest
before the abduction of Sitá. The account of his sallying forth, of his
battle with Ráma and of his death by the fiery dart of that hero
occupies two Cantos which I entirely pass over. Indrajit again comes
forth and, rendered invisible by his magic art slays countless Vánars
with his unerring arrows. He retires to the city and returns bearing in
his chariot an effigy of Sitá, the work of magic, weeping and wailing by
his side. He grasps the lovely image by the hair and cuts it down with
his scimitar in the sight of the enraged Hanúmán and all the Vánar host.
At last after much fighting of the usual kind Indrajit's chariot is
broken in pieces, his charioteer is slain, and he himself falls by
Lakshman's hand, to the inexpressible delight of the high-souled saints,
the nymphs of heaven aud other celestial beings.

<span id="fn_1011"></span>[487:1b](ry472.htm#fr_1011.md) The Lokapálas are
sometimes regarded as deities appointed by Brahmá at the creation of the
word\* to act as guardians of different orders of beings, but more
commonly they are identified with the deities presiding over the four
cardinal and four intermediate points of the compass, which, according
to Manu V.96, are 1, Indra, guardian of the East; 2, Agni, of the
South-east; 3, Yama, of the South; 4, Súrya, of the South-west: 5,
Varuna, of the West; 6, Pavana or Váyu, of the North-west; 7, Kuvera, of
the North; 8, Soma or Chandra, of the North-east.
