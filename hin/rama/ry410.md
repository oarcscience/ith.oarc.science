### CANTO XI.: THE SUMMONS.

Still Rávan's haughty heart rebelled.  
The counsel of the wise repelled,  
And, as his breast with passion burned,  
His thoughts again to Sitá turned.  
Thus, to each sign of danger blind,  
To love and war he still inclined.  
Then mounted he his car that glowed  
With gems and golden net, and rode  
Where, gathered at the monarch's call,  
The nobles filled the council hall.  
A host of warriors bright and gay  
With coloured robes and rich array,  
With shield and mace and spear and sword,  
Followed the chariot of their lord  
Mid the loud voice of shells and beat  
Of drums he raced along the street,  
And, ere he came, was heard afar  
The rolling thunder of his car.  
He reached the doors: the nobles bent  
Their heads before him reverent:  
And, welcomed with their loud acclaim,  
Within the glorious hall he came.  
He sat upon a royal seat  
With golden steps beneath his feet,  
And bade the heralds summon all  
His captains to the council hall.  
The heralds heard the words he spake,  
And sped from house to house to wake  
The giants where they slept or spent  
The careless hours in merriment.  
These heard the summons and obeyed:  
From chamber, grove, and colonnade,  
On elephants or cars they rode,  
Or through the streets impatient strode.  
As birds on rustling pinions fly  
Through regions of the darkened sky,  
Thus cars and mettled coursers through  
The crowded streets of Lanká flew.  
The council hall was reached, and then,  
As lions seek their mountain den.  
Through massy doors that opened wide,  
With martial stalk the captains hied.  
Welcomed with honour as was meet  
They stooped to press their monarch's feet,

And each a place in order found  
On stool, on cushion, or the ground.  
Nor did the sage Vibhishan long  
Delay to join the noble throng.  
High on a car that shone like flame  
With gold and flashing gems he came,  
Drew near and spoke his name aloud,  
And reverent to his brother bowed.
