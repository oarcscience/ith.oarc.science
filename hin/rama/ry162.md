### CANTO LXXXIV.: GUHA'S ANGER.

King Guha saw the host spread o'er  
The wide expanse of Gangá's shore,  
With waving flag and pennon graced,  
And to his followers spoke in haste:  
'A mighty army meets my eyes,  
That rivals Ocean's self in size:  
Where'er I look my very mind  
No limit to the host can find.  
Sure Bharat with some evil thought  
His army to our land has brought.  
See, huge of form, his flag he rears,  
That like an Ebony-tree appears.  
He comes with bonds to take and chain,  
Or triumph o'er our people slain:  
And after, Ráma will be slay,--  
Him whom his father drove away:  
The power complete he longs to gain.  
And--task too hard--usurp the reign.  

So Bharat comes with wicked will  
His brother Rama's blood to spill.  
But Ráma's slave and friend am I;  
He is my lord and dear ally.  
Keep here your watch in arms arrayed  
Near Gangá's flood to lend him aid,  
And let my gathered servants stand  
And line with troops the river strand.  
Here let the river keepers meet.  
Who flesh and roots and berries eat;  
A hundred fishers man each boat  
Of the five hundred here afloat,  
And let the youthful and the strong  
Assemble in defensive throng.  
But yet, if, free from guilty thought  
'Gainst Ráma, he this land have sought,  
The prince's happy host to day  
Across the flood shall make its way.'  
   He spoke: then bearing in a dish  
A gift of honey, meat, and fish,  
The king of the Nishadas drew  
Toward Bharat for an interview.  
When Bharat's noble charioteer  
Observed the monarch hastening near,  
He duly, skilled in courteous lore,  
The tidings to his master bore:  
'This aged prince who hither bends  
His footsteps with a thousand friends,  
Knows, firm ally of Ráma, all  
That may in Danduk wood befall:  
Therefore, Kakutstha's son, admit  
The monarch, as is right and fit:  
For doubtless he can clearly tell  
Where Ráma now and Lakshman dwell.'  
   When Bharat heard Sumantra's rede,  
To his fair words the prince agreed:  
'Go quickly forth,' he cried, 'and bring  
Before my face the aged king.'  
King Guha, with his kinsmen near,  
Rejoiced the summoning to hear:  
He nearer drew, bowed low his head,  
And thus to royal Bharat said:  
'No mansions can our country boast,  
And unexpected comes thy host:  
But what we have I give thee all:  
Rest in the lodging of thy thrall.  
See, the Nishadas here have brought  
The fruit and roots their hands have sought:  
And we have woodland fare beside.  
And store of meat both fresh and dried.  
To rest their weary limbs, I pray  
This night at least thy host may stay:  
Then cheered with all we can bestow  
To-morrow thou with it mayst go.'
