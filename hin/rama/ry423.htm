<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXIV.: THE SPY'S RETURN.</H3>
<P>
As shine the heavens with autumn's moon<BR>
Refulgent in the height of noon,<BR>
So shone with light which R&aacute;ma gave<BR>
That army of the bold and brave,<BR>
As from the sea it marched away<BR>
In war's magnificent array,<BR>
And earth was shaken by the beat<BR>
And trampling of unnumbered feet.<BR>
Then to the giants' ears were borne,<BR>
The mingled notes of drum and horn,<BR>
And clash of tambours smote the sky,<BR>
And shouting and the battle cry.<BR>
The sound of martial strains inspired<BR>
Each chieftain, and his bosom fired:<BR>
While giants from their walls replied,<BR>
And answering shouts the foe defied,<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma looked on Lank&aacute; where<BR>
Bright banners floated in the air,<BR>
And, pierced with anguish at the view.<BR>
His loving thoughts to Sit&aacute; flew.<BR>
'There, prisoned by the giant, lies<BR>
My lady of the tender eyes,<BR>
Like Rohini the queen of stars<BR>
O'erpowered by the fiery Mars.'<BR>
Then turned he to his brother chief<BR>
And cried in agony of grief:<BR>
'See on the hill, divinely planned<BR>
And built by Vis'vakarm&aacute;'s hand,<BR>
The towers and domes of Lank&aacute; rise<BR>
In peerless beauty to the skies.<BR>
Bright from afar the city shines<BR>
With gleam of palaces and shrines,<BR>
Like pale clouds through the region spread<BR>
Bv Vishnu's self inhabited.<BR>
Fair gardens grow, and woods between<BR>
The stately domes are fresh and green,<BR>
Where trees their bloom and fruit display,<BR>
And sweet birds sing on every spray.<BR>
Each bird is mad with joy, and bees<BR>
Sing labouring in the bloomy trees<BR>
On branches by the breezes bowed.<BR>
Where the gay Ko&iuml;l's voice is loud.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  This said, he ranged with warlike art<BR>
Each body of the host apart.<BR>

'There in the centre,' R&aacute;ma cried,<BR>
'Be Angad's place by N&iacute;la's side.<BR>
Let Rishabh of impetuous might<BR>
Be lord and leader on the right,<BR>
And Gandham&aacute;dan, next in rank,<BR>
Be captain of the farther flank.<BR>
Lakshman and I the hosts will lead,<BR>
And J&aacute;mbav&aacute;n of ursine breed,<BR>
With bold Sushen unused to fear,<BR>
And Vegadars&iacute;, guide the rear.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;ma spoke: the chiefs obeyed;<BR>
And all the V&aacute;nar hosts arrayed<BR>
Showed awful as the autumn sky<BR>
When clouds embattled form on high.<BR>
Their arms were mighty trees o'erthrown<BR>
And massy blocks of mountain stone.<BR>
One hope in every warlike breast,<BR>
One firm resolve, they onward pressed,<BR>
To die in fight or batter down<BR>
The walls and towers of Lank&aacute;'s town.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Those marshalled legions R&aacute;ma eyed,<BR>
And thus to King Sugr&iacute;va cried:<BR>
'Now, Monarch, ere the hosts proceed,<BR>
Let S'uka, R&aacute;van's spy, be freed.'<BR>
He spoke: the V&aacute;nar gave consent<BR>
And loosed him from imprisonment:<BR>
And S'uka, trembling and afraid,<BR>
His homeward way to R&aacute;van made.<BR>
Loud laughed the lord of Lank&aacute;'s isle:<BR>
'Where hast thou stayed this weary while?<BR>
'Why is thy plumage marred, and why<BR>
Do twisted cords thy pinions tie?<BR>
Say, comest thou in evil plight<BR>
The victim of the V&aacute;nars' spite?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: the spy his fear controlled,<BR>
And to the king his story told:<BR>
'I reached the ocean's distant shore,<BR>
Thy message to the king I bore,<BR>
In sudden wrath the V&aacute;nars rose,<BR>
They struck me down with furious blows;<BR>
They seized me helpless on the ground,<BR>
My plumage rent, my pinions bound.<BR>
They would not, headlong in their ire,<BR>
Consider, listen, or inquire;<BR>
So fickle, wrathful, rough and rude<BR>
Is the wild forest multitude.<BR>
There, marshalling the V&aacute;nar bands,<BR>
King R&aacute;ma with Sugr&iacute;va stands,<BR>
R&aacute;ma the matchless warrior, who<BR>
Vir&aacute;dha and Kabandha slew,<BR>
Khara, and countless giants more.<BR>
And tracks his queen to Lank&aacute;s shore.<BR>
A bridge athwart the sea was cast,<BR>
And o'er it have his legions passed.<BR>
Hark I heralded by horns and drums<BR>
The terrible avenger comes.<BR>
E'en now the giants' isle he fills<BR>
With warriois huge as clouds and hills,<BR>
And burning with vindictive hate<BR>
Will thunder soon at Lank&aacute;'s gate.<BR>

<P>
Yield or oppose him: choose between<BR>
Thy safety and the Maithil queen.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: the tyrant's eyeballs blazed<BR>
With fury as his voice he raised:<BR>
'No, if the dwellers of the sky,<BR>
Gandharvas, fiends assail me, I<BR>
Will keep the Maithil lady still,<BR>
Nor yield her back for fear or ill.<BR>
When shall my shafts with iron bail<BR>
My foeman, Raghu's son, assail,<BR>
Thick as the bees with eager wing<BR>
Beat on the flowery trees of spring?<BR>
O, let me meet my foe at length,<BR>
And strip him of his vaunted strength,<BR>
Fierce as the sun who shines afar<BR>
Stealing the light of every star.<BR>
Strong as the sea's impetuous might<BR>
My ways are like the tempest's flight;<BR>
But R&aacute;ma knows not this, or he<BR>
In terror from my face would flee.'<BR>
