### CANTO XCVIII: LAKSHMAN CALMED.

Then Ráma nobly calm allayed  
The wrath that Lakshman's bosom swayed:  
'What need have we the sword to wield,  
To bend the bow or lift the shield,  
If Bharat brave, and wise, and good,  
Himself has sought this sheltering wood?  
I sware my father's will to do,  
And if I now my brother slew  
What gain in kingship should I find,  
Despised and scorned by all mankind?  
Believe me, e'en as I would shrink  
From poisoned meat or deadly drink,  
No power or treasure would I win  
By fall of friend or kith or kin.  
Brother, believe the words I speak:  
For your dear sakes alone I seek  
Duty and pleasure, wealth and gain:  
A holy life, a happy reign.  
If royal sway my heart desires,  
My brothers' weal the wish inspires:  
Their bliss and safety is my care,  
By this uplifted bow I swear.  
'Twere not so hard for me to gain  
This broad land girdled by the main,  
But even Indra's royal might  
Should ne'er be mine in duty's spite,  
If any bliss my soul can see  
Deprived of dear S'atrughna, thee,  
And Bharat, may the flame destroy  
With ashy gloom the selfish joy.  
Far dearer than this life of mine,  
Knowing the custom of our line,  
His heart with fond affection fraught,  
Bharat Ayodhyá's town resought,  
And hearing when he came that I,  
With thee and Sítá, forced to fly  
With matted hair and hermit dress  
Am wandering in the wilderness.  
While grief his troubled senses storms,  
And tender love his bosom warms,  
From every thought of evil clear,  
Is come to meet his brother here.  
Some grievous words perchance he spoke  
Kaikeyí's anger to provoke,  
Then won the king, and comes to lay  
Before my feet the royal sway.  
Hither, methinks, in season due  
Comes Bharat for an interview,  
Nor in his secret heart has he  
One evil thought 'gainst thee or me.  
What has he done ere now, reflect!  
How failed in love or due respect  

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>  

To make thee doubt his faith and lay  
This evil to his charge to-day?  
Thou shouldst not join with Bharat's name  
So harsh a speech and idle blame.  
The blows thy tongue at Bharat deals,  
My sympathizing bosom feels.  
How, urged by stress of any ill,  
Should sons their father's life-blood spill,  
Or brother slay in impious strife  
A brother dearer than his life?  
If thou these cruel words hast said  
By strong desire of empire led,  
My brother Bharat will I pray  
To give to thee the kingly sway.  
'Give him the realm', my speech shall be,  
And Bharat will, methinks, agree.'  
   Thus spoke the prince whose chief delight  
Was duty, and to aid the right:  
And Lakshman keenly felt the blame,  
And shrank within himself for shame:  
And then his answer thus returned,  
With downcast eye and cheek that burned:  
'Brother, I weep, to see thy face  
Our sire himself has sought this place.'  
Thus Lakshman spoke and stood ashamed,  
And Rama saw and thus exclaimed:  
'It is the strong-armed monarch: he  
Is come, methinks, his sons to see,  
To bid us both the forest quit  
For joys for which he deems us fit:  
He thinks on all our care and pain,  
And now would lead us home again.  
My glorious father hence will bear  
Sita who claims all tender care.  
I see two coursers fleet as storms,  
Of noble breed and lovely forms.  
I see the beast of mountain size  
Who bears the king our father wise,  
The aged Victor, march this way  
In front of all the armed array.  
But doubt and fear within me rise,  
For when I look with eager eyes  
I see no white umbrella spread,  
World-famous, o'er the royal head.  
Now, Lakshman, from the tree descend,  
And to my words attention lend.  
   Thus spoke the pious prince: and he  
Descended from the lofty tree,  
And reverent hand to hand applied,  
Stood humbly by his brother's side.  
   The host, compelled by Bharat's care,  
The wood from trampling feet to spare,  
Dense crowding half a league each way  
Encamped around the mountain lay.  
Below the tall hill's shelving side  
Gleamed the bright army far and wide  
   Spread o'er the ample space,  
By Bharat led who firmly true  
In duty from his bosom threw  
All pride, and near his brother drew  
To win the hero's grace.
