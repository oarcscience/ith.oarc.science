### CANTO LIX.: SAMPATI'S STORY.

They heard his counsel to the close,  
Then swiftly to their feet they rose;  
And Jambavan with joyous breast  
The vulture king again addressed:  
  "Where, where is Sítá? who has seen,  
Who borne away the Maithil queen?  
Who would the lightning flight withstand  
Of arrows shot by Lakshman's hand"  
  Again Sampáti spoke to cheer  
The Vánars as they bent to hear:  
'Now listen, and my words shall show  
What of the Maithil dame I know,  
And in what distant prison lies  
The lady of the long dark eyes.  
Scorched by the fiery God of Day,  
High on this mighty hill I lay.  
A long and weary time had passed,  
And strength and life were failing fast.  
Yet, ere the breath had left my frame,  
My son, my dear Supárs'va, came.  
Each morn and eve he brought me food,  
And filial care my life renewed.  
But serpents still are swift to ire.  
Gandbarvas slaves to soft desire.  
And we, imperial vultures, need  
A full supply our maws to feed.  
Once he turned at close of day,  
Stood by my side, but brought no prey.  
He looked upon my ravenous eye,  
Heard my complaint and made reply:  

  'Borne on swift wings ere day was light  
I stood upon Mahendra's  <span id="fr_775"></span>[1b](ry335.htm#fn_775.md)
height,  
And, far below, the sea I viewed  
And birds in countless multitude.  
Before mine eyes a giant flew  
Whose monstrous form was dark of hue  
And struggling in his grasp was borne  
A lady radiant as the morn.  
Swift to the south his course he bent,  
And cleft the yielding element.  
The holy spirits of the air  
Came round me as I marvelled there,  
And cried as their bright legions met:  
'O say, is Sítá living yet?'  
Thus cried the saints and told the name  
Of him who held the struggling dame.  
Then while mine eye with eager look  
Pursued the path the robber took,  
I marked the lady's streaming hair,  
And heard her cry of wild despair.  
I saw her silken vesture rent  
And stripped of every ornament,  
Thus, O my father, fled the time:  
Forgive, I pray, the heedless crime.'  
In vain the mournful tale I heard  
My pitying heart to fury stirred.  
What could a helpless bird of air,  
Reft of his boasted pinions, dare?  
Yet can I aid with all that will  
And words can do, and friendly skill.'
