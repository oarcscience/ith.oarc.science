<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXIV.: BHARAT'S LAMEST.</H3>
<P>
When Bharat's anger-sharpened tongue<BR>
Reproaches on the queen had flung,<BR>
Again, with mighty rage possessed,<BR>
The guilty dame he thus addressed:<BR>
'Flee, cruel, wicked sinner, flee,<BR>
Let not this kingdom harbour thee.<BR>
Thou who hast thrown all right aside,<BR>
Ween thou for me when I have died.<BR>
Canst thou one charge against the king,<BR>
Or the most duteous R&aacute;ma bring?<BR>
The one thy sin to death has sent,<BR>
The other chased to banishment.<BR>
Our line's destroyer, sin defiled<BR>
Like one who kills an unborn child,<BR>
Ne'er with thy lord in heaven to dwell,<BR>
Thy portion shall be down in hell<BR>
Because thy hand, that stayed for naught,<BR>
This awful wickedness has wrought,<BR>
And ruined him whom all held dear,<BR>
My bosom too is stirred with fear.<BR>
My father by thy sin is dead,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma to the wood is fled;<BR>
And of thy deed I bear the stain,<BR>
And fameless in the world remain.<BR>
Ambitious, evil-souled. in show<BR>
My mother, yet my direst foe.<BR>
My throning ne'er thine eyes shall bless,<BR>
Thy husband's wicked murderess.<BR>

<P>
Thou art not As'vapati's child,<BR>
That righteous king most sage and mild,<BR>
But thou wast born a fiend, a foe<BR>
My father's house to overthrow.<BR>
Thou who hast made Kaus'aly&aacute;, pure,<BR>
Gentle, affectionate, endure<BR>
The loss of him who was her bliss--<BR>
What worlds await thee, Queen, for this?<BR>
Was it not patent to thy sense<BR>
That R&aacute;ma was his friends' defence,<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;'s own true child most dear,<BR>
The eldest and his father's peer?<BR>
Men in the son not only trace<BR>
The father's figure, form, and face,<BR>
But in his heart they also find<BR>
The offspring of the father's mind;<BR>
And hence, though dear their kinsmen are,<BR>
To mothers sons are dearer far.<BR>
There goes an ancient legend how<BR>
Good Surabhi, the God-loved cow,<BR>
Saw two of her dear children strain,<BR>
Drawing a plough and faint with pain.<BR>
She saw them on the earth outworn,<BR>
Toiling till noon from early morn,<BR>
And as she viewed her children's woe,<BR>
A flood of tears began to flow.<BR>
As through the air beneath her swept<BR>
The Lord of Gods, the drops she wept,<BR>
Fine, laden with delicious smell,<BR>
Upon his heavenly body fell,<BR>
And Indra lifted up his eyes<BR>
And saw her standing in the skies,<BR>
Afflicted with her sorrow's weight,<BR>
Sad, weeping, all disconsolate.<BR>
The Lord of Gods in anxious mood<BR>
Thus spoke in suppliant attitude:<BR>
'No fear disturbs our rest, and how<BR>
Comes this great dread upon thee now?<BR>
Whence can this woe upon thee fall,<BR>
Say, gentle one who lovest all?'<BR>

<P>
Thus spake the God who rules the skies,<BR>
Indra, the Lord supremely wise;<BR>
And gentle Surabhi, well learned<BR>
In eloquence, this speech returned:<BR>
'Not thine the fault, great God, not thine<BR>
And guiltless are the Lords divine:<BR>
I mourn two children faint with toil,<BR>
Labouring hard in stubborn soil,<BR>
Wasted and sad I see them now,<BR>
While the sun beats on neck and brow,<BR>
Still goaded by the cruel hind,--<BR>
No pity in his savage mind.<BR>
O Indra, from this body sprang<BR>
These children, worn with many a pang.<BR>
For this sad sight I mourn, for none<BR>
Is to the mother like her son.'<BR>

<P>
He saw her weep whose offspring feed<BR>
In thousands over hill and mead,<BR>
And knew that in a mother's eye<BR>
Naught with a son, for love, can vie.<BR>
He deemed her, when the tears that came<BR>
From her sad eyes bedewed his frame,<BR>
Laden with their celestial scent,<BR>
Of living things most excellent,<BR>
If she these tears of sorrow shed<BR>
Who many a thousand children bred,<BR>
Think what a life of woe is left<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;, of her R&aacute;ma reft.<BR>
An only son was hers and she<BR>
Is rendered childless now by thee.<BR>
Here and hereafter, for thy crime,<BR>
Woe is thy lot through endless time.<BR>
And now, O Queen, without delay,<BR>
With all due honour will I pay<BR>
Both to my brother and my sire<BR>
The rites their several fates require.<BR>
Back to Ayodhy&aacute; will I bring<BR>
The long-armed chief, her lord and king,<BR>
And to the wood myself betake<BR>
Where hermit saints their dwelling make.<BR>
For, sinner both in deed and thought!<BR>
This hideous crime which thou hast wrought<BR>
I cannot bear, or live to see<BR>
The people's sad eyes bent on me.<BR>
Begone, to Dandak wood retire,<BR>
Or cast thy body to the fire,<BR>
Or bind around thy neck the rope:<BR>
No other refuge mayst thou hope.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma, lord of valour true,<BR>
Has gained the earth, his right and due,<BR>
Then, free from duty's binding debt,<BR>
My vanished sin shall I forget.'<BR>

<P>
Thus like an elephant forced to brook<BR>
The goading of the driver's hook,<BR>
Quick panting like a serpent maimed,<BR>
He fell to earth with rage inflamed.<BR>
