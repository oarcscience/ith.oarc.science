<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXVI.: THE BIRTH OF GANG&Aacute;.</H3>
<P>
The hours of night now waning fast<BR>
On S'ona's pleasant shore they passed.<BR>
Then, when the dawn began to break,<BR>
To R&aacute;ma thus the hermit spake:<BR>
'The light of dawn is breaking clear,<BR>
The hour of morning rites is near,<BR>
Rise, R&aacute;ma, rise, dear son, I pray,<BR>
And make thee ready for the way.'<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma rose, and finished all<BR>
His duties at the hermit's call,<BR>
Prepared with joy the road to take,<BR>
And thus again in question spake:<BR>
'Here fair and deep the S'ona flows,<BR>
And many an isle its bosom shows:<BR>
What way, O Saint, will lead us o'er<BR>
And land us on the farther shore?<BR>
The saint replied: 'The way I choose<BR>
Is that which pious hermits use.'<BR>

<P>
For many a league they journeyed on<BR>
Till, when the sun of mid-day shone,<BR>
The hermit-haunted flood was seen<BR>
Of J&aacute;hnav&iacute;, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the Rivers' Queen.<BR>
Soon as the holy stream they viewed,<BR>
Thronged with a white-winged multitude<BR>
Of sarases &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and swans, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> delight<BR>
Possessed them at the lovely sight:<BR>
And then prepared the hermit band<BR>
To halt upon that holy strand.<BR>
They bathed as Scripture bids, and paid<BR>
Oblations due to God and shade.<BR>
To Fire they burnt the offerings meet,<BR>
And sipped the oil, like Amrit sweet.<BR>
Then pure and pleased they sate around<BR>
Saint Vis'v&aacute;mitra on the ground.<BR>
The holy men of lesser note,<BR>
In due degree, sate more remote,<BR>
While Raghu's sons took nearer place<BR>
By virtue of their rank and race.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma said: 'O Saint, I yearn<BR>
The three-pathed Gang&aacute;'s tale to learn.'<BR>

<P>
Thus urged, the sage recounted both<BR>
The birth of Gang&aacute; and her growth:<BR>
'The mighty hill with metals stored,<BR>
Him&aacute;laya, is the mountains' lord,<BR>
The father of a lovely pair<BR>
Of daughters fairest of the fair:<BR>
Their mother, offspring of the will<BR>
Of Meru, everlasting hill,<BR>
Men&aacute;, Him&aacute;laya's darling, graced<BR>
With beauty of her dainty waist.<BR>
Gang&aacute; was elder-born: then came<BR>
The fair one known by Um&aacute;'s name.<BR>
Then all the Gods of heaven, in need<BR>
Of Gang&aacute;'s help their vows to speed,<BR>
To great Him&aacute;laya came and prayed<BR>
The mountain King to yield the maid.<BR>
He, not regardless of the weal<BR>
Of the three worlds, with holy zeal<BR>
His daughter to the Immortals gave,<BR>
Gang&aacute; whose waters cleanse and save,<BR>
Who roams at pleasure, fair and free,<BR>
Purging all sinners, to the sea.<BR>
The three-pathed Gang&aacute; thus obtained,<BR>
The Gods their heavenly homes regained.<BR>
Long time the sister Um&aacute; passed<BR>
In vows austere and rigid fast,<BR>
And the king gave the devotee<BR>
Immortal Rudra's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> bride to be,<BR>
Matching with that unequalled Lord<BR>
His Um&aacute; through the worlds adored.<BR>
So now a glorious station fills<BR>


<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>


<P>
Each daughter of the King of Hills:<BR>
One honoured as the noblest stream,<BR>
One mid the Goddesses supreme.<BR>
Thus Gang&aacute;, King Him&aacute;laya's child,<BR>
The heavenly river, undefiled,<BR>
Rose bearing with her to the sky<BR>
Her waves that bless and purify.'<BR>
