<P>
Right glad was Vis'v&aacute;mitra when<BR>
He saw the prince of saintly men.<BR>
Low at his feet the hero bent,<BR>
And did obeisance, reverent.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The king was welcomed in, and shown<BR>
A seat beside the hermit's own,<BR>
Who offered him, when resting there,<BR>
Fruit in due course, and woodland fare.<BR>
And Vis'v&aacute;mitra, noblest king,<BR>
Received Vas'ishtha's welcoming,<BR>
Turned to his host, and prayed him tell<BR>
That he and all with him were well.<BR>
Vas'ishtha to the king replied<BR>
That all was well on every side,<BR>
That fire, and vows, and pupils throve,<BR>
And all the trees within the grove.<BR>
And then the son of Brahm&aacute;, best<BR>
Of all who pray with voice suppressed,<BR>
Questioned with pleasant words like these<BR>
The mighty king who sate at ease:<BR>
'And is it well with thee? I pray;<BR>
And dost thou win by virtuous sway<BR>
Thy people's love, discharging all<BR>
The duties on a king that fall?<BR>
Are all thy servants fostered well?<BR>
Do all obey, and none rebel?<BR>
Hast thou, destroyer of the foe,<BR>
No enemies to overthrow?<BR>
Does fortune, conqueror! still attend<BR>
Thy treasure, host, and every friend!<BR>
Is it all well? Does happy fate<BR>
On sons and children's children wait!'<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke. The modest king replied<BR>
That all was prosperous far and wide.<BR>

<P>
Thus for awhile the two conversed,<BR>
As each to each his tale rehearsed,<BR>
And as the happy moments flew,<BR>
Their joy and friendship stronger grew.<BR>
When such discourse had reached an end,<BR>
Thus spoke the saint most reverend<BR>
To royal Vis'vamitra, while<BR>
His features brightened with a smile:<BR>
'O mighty lord of men. I fain<BR>
Would banquet thee and all thy train<BR>
In mode that suits thy station high:<BR>
And do not thou my prayer deny.<BR>
Let my good lord with favour take<BR>
The offering that I fain would make,<BR>
And let me honour, ere we part.<BR>
My royal guest with loving heart.'<BR>

<P>
Him Vis'v&aacute;mitra thus addressed:<BR>
'Why make, O Saint, this new request?<BR>
Thy welcome and each gracious word<BR>
Sufficient honour have conferred.<BR>
Thou gavest roots and fruit to eat,<BR>
The treasures of this pure retreat,<BR>
And water for my mouth and feet;<BR>
And--boon I prize above the rest--<BR>
Thy presence has mine eyesight blest.<BR>
Honoured by thee in every way,<BR>
To whom all honour all should pay,<BR>
I now will go. My lord, Good-bye!<BR>
Regard me with a friendly eye.'<BR>

<P>
Him speaking thus Vas'ishtha stayed,<BR>
And still to share his banquet prayed.<BR>
The will of G&aacute;dhi's son he bent,<BR>
And won the monarch to consent,<BR>
Who spoke in answer. 'Let it be,<BR>
Great Hermit, as it pleases thee.'<BR>
When, best of those who breathe the prayer,<BR>
He heard the king his will declare,<BR>
He called the cow of spotted skin,<BR>
All spot without, all pure within.<BR>
'Come, Dapple-skin,' he cried, 'with speed;<BR>
Hear thou my words and help at need.<BR>
My heart is set to entertain<BR>
This monarch and his mighty train<BR>
With sumptuous meal and worthy fare;<BR>
Be thine the banquet to prepare.<BR>
Each dainty cute, each goodly dish,<BR>
Of six-fold taste&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>  as each may wish--<BR>
All these, O cow of heavenly power,<BR>
Rain down for me in copious shower:<BR>
Viands and drink for tooth and lip,<BR>
To eat, to suck, to quaff, to sip--<BR>
Of these sufficient, and to spare,<BR>
O plenty-giving cow, prepare.'<BR>
