### CANTO XLVIII: RÁVAN'S SPEECH.

With knitted brow and furious eye  
The stranger made his fierce reply;  
'In me O fairest dame, behold  
The brother of the King of Gold.  
The Lord of Ten Necks my title, named  
Rávan, for might and valour famed.  
Gods and Gandharva hosts I scare;  
Snakes, spirits, birds that roam the air  
Fly from my coming, wild with fear,  
Trembling like men when Death is near  
Vais'ravan once, my brother, wrought  
To ire, encountered me aud fought,  

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>  

But yielding to superior might  
Fled from his home in sore affright.  
Lord of the man-drawn chariot, still  
He dwells on famed Kailása's hill.  
I made the vanquished king resign  
The glorious car which now is mine,--  
Pushpak, the far-renowned, that flies  
Will-guided through the buxom skies.  
Celestial hosts by Indra led  
Flee from my face disquieted,  
And where my dreaded feet appear  
The wind is hushed or breathless is fear.  
Where'er I stand, where'er I go  
The troubled waters cease to flow,  
Each spell-bound wave is mute and still  
And the fierce sun himself is chill.  
Beyond the sea my Lanká stands  
Filled with fierce forms and giant bands,  
A glorious city fair to see  
As Indra's Amarávatí.  
A towering height of solid wall,  
Flashing afar, surrounds it all,  
Its golden courts enchant the sight,  
And gates aglow with lazulite.  
Steeds, elephants, and cars are there,  
And drums' loud music fills the air,  
Fair trees in lovely gardens grow  
Whose boughs with varied fruitage glow.  
Thou, beauteous Queen, with me shalt dwell  
In halls that suit a princess well,  
Thy former fellows shall forget  
Nor think of women with regret,  
No earthly joy thy soul shall miss,  
And take its fill of heavenly bliss.  
Of mortal Ráma think no more,  
Whose terms of days will soon be o'er.  
King Das'aratha looked in scorn  
On Ráma though the eldest born,  
Sent to the woods the weakling fool,  
And set his darling son to rule  
What, O thou large-eyed dame, hast thou  
To do with fallen Ráma now,  
From home and kingdom forced to fly,  
A wretched hermit soon to die  
Accept thy lover, nor refuse  
The giant king who fondly woos.  
O listen, nor reject in scorn  
A heart by Káma's arrows torn.  
If thou refuse to hear my prayer,  
Of grief and coming woe beware;  
For the sad fate will fall on thee  
Which came on hapless Urvas'í,  
When with her foot she chanced to touch  
Purúravas, and sorrowed much.  <span id="fr_503"></span>[1](#fn_503.md)  
My little finger raised in fight  
Were more than match for Ráma's might  
O fairest, blithe and happy be  

With him whom fortune sends to thee.'  
   Such were the words the giant said,  
And Sítá's angry eyes were red.  
She answered in that lonely place  
The monarch of the giant race:  
   'Art thou the brother of the Lord  
Of Gold by all the world adored,  
And sprung of that illustrious seed  
Wouldst now attempt this evil deed?  
I tell thee, impious Monarch, all  
The giants by thy sin will fall,  
Whose reckless lord and king thou art,  
With foolish mind and lawless heart.  
Yea, one may hope to steal the wife  
Of Indra and escape with life.  
But he who Ráma's dame would tear  
From his loved side must needs despair,  
Yea, one may steal fair S'achí, dame  
Of Him who shoots the thunder flame,  
May live successful in his aim  
   And length of day may see;  
But hope, O giant King, in vain,  
Though cups of Amrit thou may drain,  
To shun the penalty and pain  
   Of wronging one like me.'
