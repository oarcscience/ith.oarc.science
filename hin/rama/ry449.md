### CANTO L.: THE BROKEN SPELL.

Sugríva viewed the flying crowd,  
And thus to Angad cried aloud:  
'Why run the trembling hosts, as flee  
Storm-scattered barks across the sea?'  
'Dost thou not mark,' the chief replied,  
Transfixed with shafts, with bloodstreams dyed,  
With arrowy toils about them wound,  
The sons of Raghu on the ground?'  

That moment brought Viohishan\* near.  
Sugríva knew the cause of fear,  
And ordered Jámbavan, who led  
The bears, to check the hosts that fled.  
The king of bears his hest obeyed:  
The Vanars' headlong flight was stayed  
A little while Vibhishan eyed  
The brothers fallen side by side.  
His giant fingers wet with dew  
Across the heroes' eyes he drew,  
Still on the pair his sad look bent,  
And spoke these word in wild lament:  
'Ah for the mighty chiefs brought low  
By coward hand and stealthy blow!  
Brave pair who loved the open fight,  

Slain by that rover of the night.  
Dishonest is the victory won  
By Indrajit my brother's son.  
I on their might for aid relied,  
And in my cause they fought and died.  
Lost is the hope that soothed each pain:  
I live, but live no more to reign,  
While Lanká's lord, untouched by ill,  
Exults in safe defiance still.'  

'Not thus,' Sugríva said, 'repine,  
For Lanká's isle shall still be thine.  
Nor let the tyrant and his son  
Exult before the fight be done,  
These royal chiefs, though now dismayed,  
Freed from the spell by Garud'a aid,  
Triumphant yet the foe shall meet  
And lay the robber at their feet.'  

His hope the Vánar monarch told,  
And thus Vibhíshan's grief consoled.  
Then to Sushen who at his side  
Expectant stood, Sugríva cried:  
'When these regain their strength and sense,  
Fly, bear them to Kishkindhá hence.  
Here with my legions will I stay,  
The tyrant and his kinsmen slay,  
And rescued from the giant king.  
The Maithil lady will I bring,  
Like Glory lost of old, restored  
By S'akra, heaven's almighty lord.'  
   
Sushen made answer: 'Hear me yet:  
When Gods and fiends in battle met,  
So fiercely fought the demon crew,  
So wild a storm of arrows flew,  
That heavenly warriors faint with pain,  
Sank smitten by the ceaseless rain.  
Vrihaspati,  <span id="fr_969"></span>[1](#fn_969.md) with herb and
spell,  
Cured the sore wounds of those who fell.  
And, skilled in arts that heal and save,  
New life and sense and vigour gave.  
Far, on the Milky Ocean's shore,  
Still grow those herbs in boundless store;  
Let swiftest Vánars thither speed  
And bring them for our utmost need.  
Those herbs that on the mountain spring  
Let Panas and Sampáti bring,  
For well the wondrous leaves they know.  
That heal each wound and life bestow.  
Beside that sea which, churned of yore,  
The amrit on its surface bore,  
Where the white billows lash the land,  
Chandra's fair height and Drona stand.  
Planted by Gods each glittering steep  
Looks down upon the milky deep.  
Let fleet Hanúmán bring us thence  
Those herbs of wondrous influence.'  

Meanwhile the rushing wind grew loud,  
Red lightnings flashed from banks of cloud.  
The mountains shook, the wild waves rose,  
And smitten with resistless blows  

<span id="page_465">p. 465</span>  

Unrooted fell each stately tree  
That fringed the margin of the sea.  
All life within the waters feared  
Then, as the Vánars gazed, appeared  
King Garud's self, a wondrous sight,  
Disclosed in flames of fiery light.  
From his fierce eye in sudden dread  
All serpents in a moment fled.  
And those transformed to shaft that bound  
The princes vanished in the ground.  
On Raghu's sons his eyes he bent,  
And hailed the lords armipotent.  
Then o'er them stooped the feathered king,  
And touched their faces with his wing.  
His healing touch their pangs allayed,  
And closed each rent the shafts had made.  
Again their eyes were bright and bold,  
Again the smooth skin shone like gold.  
Again within their shell enshrined  
Came memory and each power of mind:  
And, from those numbing bonds released,  
Their spirit, zeal, and strength increased.  
Firm on their feet they stood, and then  
Thus Ráma spake, the lord of men:  
   'By thy dear grace in sorest need  
From deadly bonds we both are freed.  
To these glad eyes as welcome now  
As Aja  <span id="fr_970"></span>[1](#fn_970.md) or my sire art thou.  
Who art thou, mighty being? say,  
Thus glorious in thy bright array.'  
He ceased: the king of birds replied,  
While flashed his eye with joy and pride:  
'In me, O Raghu's son, behold  
One who has loved thee from of old:  
Garud, the lord of all that fly,  
Thy guardian and thy friend am I.  
Not all the Gods in heaven could loose  
These numbing bonds, this serpent noose,  
Wherewith fierce Rávan's son, renowned  
For magic arts, your limbs had bound.  
Those arrows fixed in every limb  
Were mighty snakes, transformed by him.  
Blood thirsty race, they live beneath  
The earth, and slay with venomed teeth.  
On, smite the lord of Lanká's isle,  
But guard you from the giants' guile  
Who each dishonest art employ  
And by deceit brave foes destroy.  
So shall the tyrant Rávan bleed,  
And Sítá from his power be freed.'  
Thus Garud spake: then, swift as thought,  
The region of the sky he sought,  
Where in the distance like a blaze  
Of fire he vanished from the gaze.  
   Then the glad Vánars joy rang out  
In many a wild tumultuous shout,  
And the loud roar of drum and shell  
Startled each distant sentinel.
