<P>
Then as the son of Raghu made<BR>
His way to Panchavat&iacute;'s shade,<BR>
A mighty vulture he beheld<BR>
Of size and strength unparalleled.<BR>
The princes, when the bird they saw,<BR>
Approached with reverence and awe,<BR>
And as his giant form they eyed,<BR>
'Tell who thou art,' in wonder cried.<BR>
The bird, as though their hearts to gain,<BR>
Addressed them thus in gentlest strain;<BR>
'In me, dear sons, the friend behold<BR>
Your royal father loved of old.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke: nor long did R&aacute;ma wait<BR>
His sire's dear friend to venerate:<BR>


<P>


<P>
He bade the bird declare his name<BR>
And the high race of which he came.<BR>
When Raghu's son had spoken, he<BR>
Declared his name and pedigree,<BR>
His words prolonging to disclose<BR>
How all the things that be arose:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'List while I tell, O Raghu's son,<BR>
The first-born Fathers, one by one,<BR>
Great Lords of Life, whence all in earth<BR>
And all in heaven derive their birth.<BR>
First Kardam heads the glorious race<BR>
Where Vikrit holds the second place,<BR>
With S'esha, Sans'ray next in line,<BR>
And Bahuputra's might divine.<BR>
Then Sth&aacute;nu and Mar&iacute;chi came,<BR>
Atri, and Kratu's forceful frame.<BR>
Pulastya followed, next to him<BR>
Angiras' name shall ne'er be dim.<BR>
Prachetas, Pulah next, and then<BR>
Daksha, Vivasvat praised of men:<BR>
Ar&iacute;shtanemi next, and last<BR>
Kas'yap in glory unsurpassed.<BR>
From Daksha,--fame the tale has told--<BR>
Three-score bright daughters sprang of old.<BR>
Of these fair-waisted nymphs the great<BR>
Lord Kas'yap sought and wedded eight,<BR>
Aditi, Diti, K&aacute;lak&aacute;,<BR>
T&aacute;mr&aacute;, Dan&uacute;, and Anal&aacute;,<BR>
And Krodhavas&aacute; swift to ire,<BR>
And Manu &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_443"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> glorious as her sire.<BR>
Then when the mighty Kas'yap cried<BR>
Delighted to each tender bride:<BR>
'Sons shalt thou bear, to rule the three<BR>
Great worlds, in might resembling me,'<BR>


<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_246"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 246</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Aditi, Diti, and Dan&uacute;<BR>
Obeyed his will as consorts true,<BR>
And K&aacute;lak&aacute;; but all the rest<BR>
Refused to hear their lord's behest.<BR>
First Aditi conceived, and she,<BR>
Mother of thirty Gods and three,<BR>
The Vasus and A'dityas bare,<BR>
Kudras, and A'svins, heavenly pair.<BR>
Of Diti sprang the Daityas: fame<BR>
Delights to laud their ancient name.<BR>
In days of yore their empire dread<BR>
O'er earth and woods and ocean spread.<BR>
Dan&uacute; was mother of a child,<BR>
O hero, As'vagr&iacute;va styled,<BR>
And Narak next and K&aacute;lak came<BR>
Of K&aacute;lak&aacute;, celestial dame.<BR>
Of T&aacute;mr&aacute;, too, five daughters bright<BR>
In deathless glory sprang to light.<BR>
Ennobling fame still keeps alive<BR>
The titles of the lovely five:<BR>
Immortal honour still she claims<BR>
For Kraunch&iacute;, Bhas&iacute;, S'yen&iacute;'s names.<BR>
And wills not that the world forget<BR>
S'uk&iacute; or Dhritar&aacute;shtr&iacute; yet.<BR>
Then Kraunch&iacute; bare the crane and owl,<BR>
And Bh&aacute;s&iacute; tribes of water fowl:<BR>
Vultures and hawks that race through air<BR>
With storm-fleet pinions S'yen&iacute; bare.<BR>
All swans and geese on mere and brook<BR>
Their birth from Dhritar&aacute;shtr&iacute; took,<BR>
And all the river-haunting brood<BR>
Of ducks, a countless multitude.<BR>
From S'uk&iacute; Nal&aacute; sprang, who bare<BR>
Dame Vinat&aacute; surpassing fair.<BR>
From fiery Krodhavas'&aacute;, ten<BR>
Bright daughters sprang, O King of men:<BR>
Mrig&iacute; and Mrigamad&aacute; named,<BR>
Hari and Bhadiamad&aacute; famed,<BR>
S'&aacute;rd&uacute;l&iacute;, S'vet&aacute; fair to see,<BR>
M&aacute;tangi bright, and Surabhi,<BR>
Suras&aacute; marked with each fair sign,<BR>
And Kadrum&aacute;, all maids divine.<BR>
Mrig&iacute;, O prince without a peer,<BR>
Was mother of the herds of deer,<BR>
The bear, the yak, the mountain roe<BR>
Their birth to Mrigamand&aacute; owe;<BR>
And Bhadramad&aacute; joyed to be<BR>
Mother of fair Ir&aacute;vat&iacute;,<BR>
Who bare Air&aacute;vat, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_444"></A><A HREF="#fn_444"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> huge of mould,<BR>
Mid warders of the earth enrolled,<BR>
From Har&iacute; lordly lions trace,<BR>
With monkeys of the wild, their race.<BR>
From the great dame S'&aacute;rd&uacute;l&iacute; styled<BR>
Sprung pards, L&aacute;ng&uacute;rs,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_445"></A><A HREF="#fn_445"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and tigers wild.<BR>
M&aacute;tangi, Prince, gave birth to all<BR>
M&aacute;tangas, elephants strong and tall,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
And S'vet'a bore the beasts who stand<BR>
One at each wind, earth's warder band. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_446"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Next Surabh&iacute; the Goddess bore<BR>
Two heavenly maids, O Prince, of yore,<BR>
Gandharvi--dear *as fa??* is she--<BR>
And her sweet sister Rohin&iacute;.<BR>
With kine this daughter filled each mead,<BR>
And bright Gandharv&iacute; bore the steed. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_447"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
Suras&aacute; bore the serpents: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_448"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> all<BR>
The snakes Kadr&uacute; their mother call.<BR>
Then Manu, high-souled Kas'yap's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_449"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">4b</FONT></A> wife,<BR>
To all the race of men gave life,<BR>
The Br&aacute;hmans first, the Kshatriya caste,<BR>
Then Vais'yas, and the S'&uacute;dras last.<BR>
Sprang from her mouth the Brahman race;<BR>
Her chest the Kshatriyas' natal place:<BR>
The Vais'yas from her thighs,'tis said,<BR>
The S'&uacute;dras from her feet were bred.<BR>
From Anal&aacute; all trees that hang<BR>
Their fair fruit-laden branches sprang.<BR>
The child of beauteous S'uk&iacute; bore<BR>
Vinat&aacute;, as I taught before:<BR>
And Suras&aacute; and Kadr&uacute; were<BR>
Born of one dame, a noble pair.<BR>
Kadr&uacute; gave birth to countless snakes<BR>
That roam the earth in woods and brakes.<BR>
Arun and Garud swift of flight<BR>
By V'inat&aacute; were given to light,<BR>
And sons' of Arun red as morn<BR>
Sampati first, then I was born,<BR>
Me then, O tamer of the toe,<BR>
Jut&aacute;yus, son of S'yen&iacute;, know.<BR>
Thy ready helper will I be,<BR>
And guard thy house, if thou agree:<BR>
When thou and Lakshman urge the chase<BR>
By S&iacute;t&aacute;'s side shall be my place.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With courteous thanks for promised aid,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The prince, to rapture stirred,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bent low, and due obeisance paid,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Embraced the royal bird.<BR>

He often in the days gone by<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Had heard his father tell<BR>
How, linked with him in friendship's tie,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He loved Jat&aacute;yus well.<BR>
He hastened to his trusted friend<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His darling to confide,<BR>
And through the wood his steps to bend<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By strong Jat&aacute;yus' side.<BR>
On to the grove, with Lakshman near,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The prince his way pursued<BR>
To free those pleasant shades from fear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And slay the giant brood.<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_442"></A><A HREF="ry211.htm#fr_442">245:1</A>  The Madh&uacute;ka, or, as it is now called,
Mahuw&aacute;, is the Bassia latifolia, a tree
from whose blossoms a spirit is extracted.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_443"></A><A HREF="ry212.htm#fr_443">245:1b</A>  'I should have doubted whether Manu
could have been the right reading here,
but that it occurs again in verse 29, where
it is in like manner followed in verse 31
by Anal&aacute;, so that it would certainly seem
that the name Manu is intended to stand
for a female, the daughter of Daksha.
The Gauda recension, followed by Signor
Gorresio (III 20, 12), adopts an entirely
different reading at the end of the line,
viz.  <I>Bal&aacute;m Atibal&aacute;m api</I>, "Bal&aacute; and
Atibil&aacute;," instead of Manu and Anal&aacute;.
I see that Professor Roth s.v. adduces the
authority of the Amara Kosha and of the
Commentator on P&aacute;nini for stating that
the word sometimes means "the wife of
Manu." In the following text of the
Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata I. 2553. also, Manu appears
to be the name of a female: <I>Anaradyam,
Manum, Vans&aacute;m, Asur&aacute;m, M&aacute;rganapriy&aacute;m,
An&uacute;p&aacute;m, Subhagdm, Bh&aacute;s&iacute;m iti
Pr&aacute;dh&aacute; vyajayata</I>. "Pr&aacute;dh&aacute; (daughter
of Daksha) bore Anavady&aacute;, Manu, Vans'&aacute;,
M&aacute;rganapriv&aacute;, An&uacute;p&aacute;, Subhag&aacute;. and
Bh&aacute;s&iacute;."' <I>Muir's  Sanskrit Text</I>, Vol. I. p.
116.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_444"></A><A HREF="ry212.htm#fr_444">246:1</A>  The elephant of Indra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_445"></A><A HREF="ry212.htm#fr_445">246:2</A>  <I>Goling&uacute;las</I>, described as a kind of
monkey, of a black colour, and having a
tail like a cow.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_446"></A><A HREF="ry212.htm#fr_446">246:1b</A>  Eight elephants attached to the four
quarters and intermediate points of the
compass, to support and guard the earth.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_447"></A><A HREF="ry212.htm#fr_447">246:2b</A>  Some scholars identify the centaurs
with the Gandharvas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_448"></A><A HREF="ry212.htm#fr_448">246:3b</A>  The hooded serpents, says the commentator
T&iacute;rtha, were the offspring of
Suras&aacute;: all others of Kadr&uacute;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_449"></A><A HREF="ry212.htm#fr_449">246:4b</A>  The text reads K&aacute;s'yapa, "a descendant
of Kas'yapa," who according to R&aacute;m.
II. l0, 6, ought to be Vivasvat. But as it
is stated in the preceding part of this
passage III. 14, 11 f. that Manu was one
of Kasyapa's eight wives, we must here
read Kasyapa. The Ganda recension
reads (III, 20, 30) <I>Manur manushyams cha
tutha janay&aacute;m&aacute;sa Raghana**</I>, instead of
the corresponding line in the Bombay edition.'
