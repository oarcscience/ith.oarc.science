<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO I.: THE HEIR APPARENT.</H3>
<P>
So Bharat to his grandsire went<BR>
Obedient to the message sent,<BR>
And for his fond companion chose<BR>
S'atrughna slayer of his foes. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
There Bharat for a time remained<BR>
With love and honour entertained,<BR>
King As'vapati's constant care,<BR>
Belov&egrave;d as a son and heir.<BR>
Yet ever, as they lived at ease,<BR>
While all around combined to please<BR>
The ag&egrave;d sire they left behind<BR>
Was present to each hero's mind.<BR>
Nor could the king's fond memory stray<BR>
From his brave children far away,<BR>
Dear Bharat and S'atrughna dear,<BR>
Each Varun's match or Indra's peer.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To all the princes, young and brave,<BR>
His soul with fond affection clave;<BR>
Around his loving heart they clung<BR>
Like arms from his own body sprung.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_259"></A><A HREF="#fn_259"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
But best and noblest of the four,<BR>
Good as the God whom all adore,<BR>
Lord of all virtues, undefiled,<BR>
His darling was his eldest child.<BR>
For he was beautiful and strong,<BR>
From envy free, the foe of wrong,<BR>
With all his father's virtues blest,<BR>
And peerless in the world confessed.<BR>
With placid soul he softly spoke:<BR>
No harsh reply could taunts provoke.<BR>
He ever loved the good and sage<BR>
Revered for virtue and for age,<BR>
And when his martial tasks were o'er<BR>
Sate listening to their peaceful lore.<BR>
Wise, modest, pure, he honoured eld,<BR>
His lips from lying tales withheld;<BR>
Due reference to the Br&aacute;hnmans gave,<BR>
And ruled each passion like a slave.<BR>
Most tender, prompt at duty's call,<BR>
Loved by all men he loved them all.<BR>
Proud of the duties of his race,<BR>
With spirit meet for Warrior's  place,<BR>
He strove to win by glorious deed,<BR>
Throned with the Gods, a priceless meed.<BR>


<P>

<P>


<P>
With him in speech and quick reply<BR>
Vrihaspati might hardly vie,<BR>
But never would his accents flow<BR>
For evil or for empty show.<BR>
In art and science duly trained,<BR>
His student vow he well maintained;<BR>
He learnt the lore for princes fit,<BR>
The Vedas and their Holy Writ,<BR>
And with his well-drawn bow at last<BR>
His mighty father's fame surpassed.<BR>
Of birth exalted, truthful, just,<BR>
With vigorous hand, with noble trust,<BR>
Well taught by aged twice-born men<BR>
Who gain and right could clearly ken,<BR>
Full well the claims and bounds he knew<BR>
Of duty, gain, and pleasure too:<BR>
Of memory keen, of ready tact,<BR>
In civil business prompt to act.<BR>
Reserved, his features ne'er disclosed<BR>
What counsel in his heart reposed.<BR>
All idle rage and mirth controlled,<BR>
He knew the times to give and hold,<BR>
Firm in his faith, of steadfast will,<BR>
He sought no wrong, he spoke no ill:<BR>
Not rashly swift, not idly slow,<BR>
His faults and others' keen to know.<BR>
Each merit, by his subtle sense,<BR>
He matched with proper recompense.<BR>
He knew the means that wealth provide,<BR>
And with keen eye expense could guide.<BR>
Wild elephants could he reclaim,<BR>
And mettled steeds could mount and tame.<BR>
No arm like his the bow could wield,<BR>
Or drive the chariot to the field.<BR>
Skilled to attack, to deal the blow,<BR>
Or lead a host against the foe:<BR>
Yea, e'en infuriate Gods would fear<BR>
To meet his arm in full career.<BR>
As the great sun in noontide blaze<BR>
Is glorious with his world of rays.<BR>
So R&aacute;ma with these virtues shone<BR>
Which all men loved to gaze upon.<BR>

<P>
The ag&egrave;d monarch fain would rest,<BR>
And said within his weary breast,<BR>
'Oh that I might, while living yet,<BR>
My R&aacute;ma o'er the kingdom set.<BR>
And see, before my course be run,<BR>
The hallowed drops anoint my son;<BR>
See all this spacious land obey,<BR>
From side to side, my first-born's sway,<BR>
And then, my life and joy complete,<BR>
Obtain in heaven a blissful seat!'<BR>
In him the monarch saw combined<BR>
The fairest form, the noblest mind,<BR>
And counselled how his son might share,<BR>
The throne with him as Regent Heir.<BR>
For fearful signs in earth and sky,<BR>
And weakness warned him death was nigh:<BR>
But R&aacute;ma to the world endeared<BR>
By every grace his bosom cheered,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_90"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 90</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
The moon of every eye, whose ray<BR>
Drove all his grief and fear away.<BR>
So duty urged that hour to seize,<BR>
Himself, his realm, to bless and please.<BR>

<P>
From town and country, far and near,<BR>
He summoned people, prince, and peer.<BR>
To each he gave a meet abode,<BR>
And honoured all and gifts bestowed.<BR>
Then, splendid in his king's attire,<BR>
He viewed them, as the general Sire,<BR>
In glory of a God arrayed,<BR>
Looks on the creatures he has made.<BR>
But Kekaya's king he called not then<BR>
For haste, nor Janak, lord of men;<BR>
For after to each royal friend<BR>
The joyful tidings he would send.<BR>
Mid crowds from distant countries met<BR>
The king upon his throne was set;<BR>
Then honoured by the people, all<BR>
The rulers thronged into the hall.<BR>
On thrones assigned, each king in place<BR>
Looked silent on the monarch's face.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then girt by lords of high renown<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And throngs from hamlet and from town<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    He showed in regal pride,<BR>
As, honoured by the radiant band<BR>
Of blessed Gods that round him stand,<BR>
Lord Indra, Thousand-eyed.<BR>
