### CANTO XLI.: RÁMA'S ENVOY.

When Ráma saw each bloody trace  
On King Sugríva's limbs and face,  
He cried, while, sorrowing at the view,  
His arms about his friend he threw:  
'Too venturous chieftain, kings like us  
Bring not their lives in peril thus;  
Nor, save when counsel shows the need,  
Attempt so bold, so rash a deed.  
Remember. I, Vibhíshan all  
Have sorrowed fearing for thy fall.  
O do not--for us all I speak--  
These desperate adventures seek,  
'I could not,' cried Sugríva, 'brook  
Upon the giant king to look,  

<span id="page_458">p. 458</span>  

Nor challenge to the deadly strife  
The fiend who robbed thee of thy wife.'  
'Now Lakshman, marshal,' Ráma cried,  
'Our legions where the woods are wide,  
And stand we ready to oppose  
The fury of our giant foes.  
This day our armies shall ascend  
The walls which Rávan's powers defend,  
And floods of Rákshas blood shall stain  
The streets encumbered with the slain.'  
Down from the peak he came, and viewed  
The Vánars' ordered multitude.  
Each captain there for battle burned,  
Each fiery eye to Lanká turned.  
On, where the royal brothers led  
To Lanká's walls the legions sped.  
The northern gate, where giant foes  
Swarmed round their monarch, Ráma chose  
Where he in person might direct  
The battle, and his troops protect.  
What arm but his the post might keep  
Where, strong as he who sways the deep,  <span
id="fr_959"></span>[1](#fn_959.md)  
Mid thousands armed with bow and mace,  
Stood Rávan mightiest of his race?  
The eastern gate was Níla's post.  
Where marshalled stood his Vánar host,  
And Mainda with his troops arrayed,  
And Dwivid stood to lend him aid.  
The southern gate was Angad's care,  
Who ranged his bold battalions there.  
Hanúmán by the port that faced  
The setting sun his legions placed,  
And King Sugríva held the wood  
East of the gate where Rávan stood.  
On every side the myriads met,  
And Lanká's walls of close beset  
That scarce the roving gale could win  
A passage to the hosts within.  
Loud as the angry ocean's roar  
When wild waves lash the rocky shore,  
Ten thousand thousand throats upsent  
A shout that tore the firmament,  
And Lanká with each grove and brook  
And tower and wall and rampart shook.  
The giants heard, and were appalled:  
Then Raghu's son to Angad called,  
And, led by kingly duty,  <span id="fr_960"></span>[2](#fn_960.md) gave  
This order merciful as brave:  
'Go, Angad, Rávan's presence seek,  
And thus my words of warning speak:  
'How art thou changed and fallen now,  
O Monarch of the giants, thou  
Whose impious fury would not spare  
Saint, nymph, or spirit of the air;  
Whose foot in haughty triumph trod  
On Yaksha, king, and Serpent God:  

How art thou fallen from thy pride  
Which Brahmá's favour fortified!  
With myriads at thy Lanká's gate  
I stand my righteous ire to sate,  
And punish thee with sword and flame,  
The tyrant fiend who stole my dame.  
Now show the might, employ the guile,  
O Monarch of the giants' isle,  
Which stole a helpless dame away:  
Call up thy power and strength to-day.  
Once more I warn thee, Rákshas King,  
This hour the Maithil lady bring,  
And, yielding while there yet is time,  
Seek, suppliant, pardon for the crime,  
Or I will leave beneath the sun  
No living Rákshas, no, not one.  
In vain from battle wilt thou fly,  
Or borne on pinions seek the sky;  
The hand of Ráma shall not spare;  
His fiery shaft shall smite thee there.'  

He ceased: and Angad bowed his head;  
Thence like embodied flame be sped,  
And lighted from his airy road  
Within the Rákshas king's abode.  
There sate, the centre of a ring  
Of counsellors, the giant king.  
Swift through the circle Angad pressed,  
And spoke with fury in his breast:  
'Sent by the lord of Kosal's land,  
His envoy here, O King, I stand,  
Angad the son of Báli: fame  
Has haply taught thine ears my name.  
Thus in the words of Ráma I  
Am come to warn thee or defy:  
Come forth, and fighting in the van  
Display the spirit of a man.  
This arm shall slay thee, tyrant: all  
Thy nobles, kith and kin shall fall:  
And earth and heaven, from terror freed,  
Shall joy to see the oppressor bleed,  
Vibhíshan, when his foe is slain,  
Anointed king in peace shall reign.  
Once more I counsel thee: repent,  
Avoid the mortal punishment,  
With honour due the dame restore,  
And pardon for thy sin implore.'  

Loud rose the king's infuriate cry:  
'Seize, seize the Vánar, let him lie.'  
Four of his band their lord obeyed,  
And eager hands on Angad laid.  
He purposing his strength to show  
Gave no resistance to the foe,  
But swiftly round his captors cast  
His mighty arms and held them fast.  
Fierce shout and cry around him rang:  
Light to the palace roof he sprang,  
There his detaining arms unwound.  
And hurled the giants to the ground,  
Then, smiting with a fearful stroke,  
A turret from the roof he broke,--  
As when the fiery levin sent  

<span id="page_459">p. 459</span>  

By Indra from the clouds has rent  
The proud peak of the Lord of Snow,-  
And flung the stony mass below.  
Again with loud terrific cry  
He sprang exulting to the sky,  
And, joyous for his errand done,  
Stood by the side of Raghu's son.
