<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXVIII.: THE DANGERS OF THE WOOD.</H3>
<P>
Thus Sit&aacute; spake, and he who knew<BR>
His duty, to its orders true,<BR>
Was still reluctant as the woes<BR>
Of forest life before him rose.<BR>
He sought to soothe her grief, to dry<BR>
The torrent from each brimming eye,<BR>
And then, her firm resolve to shake,<BR>
These words to pious hero spake:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'O daughter of a noble line,<BR>
Whose steps from virtue ne'er decline,<BR>
Remain, thy duties here pursue,<BR>
As my fond heart would have thee do.<BR>
Now hear me, Sit&aacute;, fair and weak,<BR>
And do the words that I shall speak.<BR>
Attend and hear while I explain<BR>
Each danger in the wood, each pain.<BR>
Thy lips have spoken: I condemn<BR>
The foolish words that fell from them.<BR>
This senseless plan, this wish of thine<BR>
To live a forest life, resign.<BR>
The names of trouble and distress<BR>
Suit well the tangled wilderness.<BR>
In the wild wood no joy I know,<BR>
A forest life is nought but woe.<BR>
The lion in his moutain cave<BR>
Answers the torrents as they rave,<BR>
And forth his voice of terror throws:<BR>
The wood, my love, is full of woes.<BR>

There mighty monsters fearless play,<BR>
And in their maddened onset slay<BR>
The hapless wretch who near them goes:<BR>
The wood, my love, is full of woes.<BR>
'Tis hard to ford each treacherous flood,<BR>
So thick with crocodiles and mud,<BR>
Where the wild elephants repose:<BR>
The wood, my love, is full of woes.<BR>
Or far from streams the wanderer strays<BR>
Through thorns and creeper-tangled ways,<BR>
While round him many a wild-cock crows:<BR>
The wood, my love, is full of woes.<BR>
On 'the cold ground upon a heap<BR>
On gathered leaves condemned to sleep,<BR>
Toil-wearied, will his eyelids close:<BR>
The wood, my love, is full of woes.<BR>
Long days and nights must he content<BR>
His soul with scanty aliment,<BR>
What fruit the wind from branches blows:<BR>
The wood, my love, is full of woes.<BR>
O Sit&aacute;, while his strength may last,<BR>
The ascetic in the wood must fast,<BR>
Coil on his head his matted hair,<BR>
And bark must be his only wear.<BR>
To Gods and spirits day by day<BR>
The ordered worship he must pay,<BR>
And honour with respectful care<BR>
Each wandering guest who meets him there.<BR>
The bathing rites he ne'er must shun<BR>
At dawn, at noon, at set of sun,<BR>
Obedient to the law he knows:<BR>
The wood, my love, is full of woes.<BR>
To grace the altar must be brought<BR>
The gift of flowers his hands have sought--<BR>
The debt each pious hermit owes:<BR>
The wood, my love, is full of woes.<BR>
The devotee must be content<BR>
To live, severely abstinent,<BR>
On what the chance of fortune shows:<BR>
The wood, my love, is full of woes.<BR>
Hunger afflicts him evermore:<BR>
The nights are black, the wild winds roar;<BR>
And there are dangers worse than those:<BR>
The wood, my love, is full of woes.<BR>
There creeping things in every form<BR>
Infest the earth, the serpents swarm,<BR>
And each proud eye with fury glows:<BR>
The wood, my love, is full of woes.<BR>
The snakes that by the river hide<BR>
In sinuous course like rivers glide,<BR>
And line the path with deadly foes:<BR>
The wood, my love, is full of woes.<BR>
Scorpions, and grasshoppers, and flies<BR>
Disturb the wanderer as he lies,<BR>
And wake him from his troubled doze:<BR>
The wood, my love, is full of woes.<BR>
Trees, thorny bushes, intertwined,<BR>
Their branched ends together bind,<BR>
And dense with grass the thicket grows:<BR>
The wood, my dear, is full of woes,<BR>
With many ills the flesh is tried,<BR>
When these and countless fears beside<BR>
Vex those who in the wood remain:<BR>
The wilds are naught but grief and pain.<BR>
Hope, anger must be cast aside,<BR>
To penance every thought applied:<BR>
No fear must be of things to fear:<BR>
Hence is the wood for ever drear.<BR>
Enough, my love: thy purpose quit:<BR>
For forest life thou art not fit.<BR>
As thus I think on all, I see<BR>
The wild wood is no place for thee.'<BR>
