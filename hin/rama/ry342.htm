<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXVII.: HANUMAN'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
Soon as his stature they beheld.<BR>
Their fear and sorrow were dispelled;<BR>
And joyous praises loud and long<BR>
Rang out from all the V&aacute;nar throng.<BR>
On the great chief their eyes they bent<BR>
In rapture and astonishment,<BR>
As, when his conquering foot he raised,<BR>
The Gods upon Nar&aacute;yan &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_787"></A><A HREF="#fn_787"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> gazed.<BR>
He stood amid the joyous crowd,<BR>
Bent to the chiefs, and cried aloud:<BR>
'The Wind-God, Fire's eternal friend.<BR>
Whose blasts the mountain summits rend,<BR>
With boundless force that none may stay,<BR>
Takes where he lists his viewless way,<BR>
Sprung from that glorious father, I<BR>
In power and speed with him may vie,<BR>
A thousand times with airy leap<BR>
Can circle loftiest Meru's steep:<BR>
With my fierce arms can stir the sea<BR>
Till from their bed the waters flee<BR>
And rush at my command to drown<BR>
This land with grove and tower and town.<BR>
I through the fields of air can spring<BR>
Far swifter than the feathered King,<BR>
And leap before him as he dies.<BR>
On sounding pinions through the skies,<BR>
I can pursue the Lord of Light<BR>
Uprising from the eastern height,<BR>
And reach him ere his course be sped<BR>
With burning beams engarlanded,<BR>
I will dry up the mighty main,<BR>
Shatter the rocks and rend the plain.<BR>
O'er earth and ocean will I bound,<BR>
And every flower that grows on ground,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
And bloom of climbing plants shall show<BR>
Strewn on the ground, the way I go.<BR>
Bright as the lustrous path that lies<BR>
Athwart the region of the skies. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_788"></A><A HREF="#fn_788"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
The Maithil lady will I find,--<BR>
Thus speaks mine own prophetic mind,--<BR>
And cast in hideous ruin down<BR>
The shattered walls of Lank&aacute;'s town.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Still on the chief in rapt surprise<BR>
The V&aacute;nar legions bent their eyes,<BR>
And thus again sage J&aacute;mbav&aacute;n<BR>
Addressed the glorious Hanum&aacute;n;<BR>
'Son of the Wind, thy promise cheers<BR>
The V&aacute;nars' hearts, and calms their fears,<BR>
Who, rescued from their dire distress.<BR>
With prospering vows thy way will bless.<BR>
The holy saints their favour lend,<BR>
And all our chiefs the deed commend<BR>
Urging thee forward on thy way;<BR>
Arise then, and the task assay.<BR>
Thou art our only refuge; we.<BR>
Our lives and all, depend on thee.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then sprang the Wind-God's son the best<BR>
Of V&aacute;nara, on Mahendra's crest.<BR>
And the great mountain rocked and swayed<BR>
By that unusual weight dismayed,<BR>
As reels an elephant beneath<BR>
The lion's spring and rending teeth.<BR>
The shady wood that crowned him shook,<BR>
The trembling birds the boughs forsook,<BR>
And ape and pard and lion fled<BR>
From brake and lair disquieted.<BR>
