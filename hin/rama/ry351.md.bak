### CANTO IX.: THE LADIES' BOWER.

Where stately mansions rose around,  
A palace fairer still he found,  
Whose royal height and splendour showed  
Where Ravan's self, the king, abode,  
A chosen band with bow and sword  
Guarded the palace of their lord,  
Where Ráksha's dames of noble race  
And many a princess fair of face  
Whom Rávan's arm had torn away  
From vanquished kings in slumber lay.  

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>  

There jewelled arches high o'erhead  
An ever-changing lustre shed  
From ruby, pearl, and every gem  
On golden pillars under them.  
Delicious came the tempered air  
That breathed a heavenly summer there,  
Stealing through bloomy trees that bore  
Each pleasant fruit in endless store.  
No check was there from jealous guard,  
No door was fast, no portal barred;  
Only a sweet air breathed to meet  
The stranger, as a host should greet  
A wanderer of his kith and kin  
And woo his weary steps within.  
He stood within a spacious hall  
With fretted roof and painted wall,  
The giant Rávan's boast and pride,  
Loved even as a lovely bride.  
'Twere long to tell each marvel there,  
The crystal floor, the jewelled stair,  
The gold, the silver, and the shine  
Of chrysolite and almandine.  
There breathed the fairest blooms of spring;  
There flashed the proud swan's silver wing,  
The splendour of whose feathers broke  
Through fragrant wreaths of aloe smoke.  
'Tis lndra's heaven,' the Vánar cried  
Gazing in joy from side to side;  
'The home of all the Gods is this,  
The mansion of eternal bliss.'  
There were the softest carpets spread,  
Delightful to the sight and tread,  
Where many a lovely woman lay  
O'ercome by sleep, fatigued with play.  
The wine no longer cheered the feast,  
The sound of revelry had ceased.  
The tinkling feet no longer stirred,  
No chiming of a zone was heard.  
So when each bird has sought her nest  
And swans are mute and wild bees rest,  
Sleep the fair lilies on the lake  
Till the sun's kiss shall bid them wake.  
Like the calm field of winter's sky  
Which stars unnumbered glorify,  
So shone and glowed the sumptuous room  
With living stars that chased the gloom.  
'These are the stars,' the chieftain cried,  
'In autumn nights that earth-ward glide,  
In brighter forms to reappear  
And shine in matchless lustre here.'  
With wondering eyes a while he viewed  
Each graceful form and attitude.  
One lady's head was backward thrown,  
Bare was her arm and loose her zone.  
The garland that her brow had graced  
Hung closely round another's waist.  
Here gleamed two little feet all bare  
Of anklets that had sparkled there,  
Here lay a queenly dame at rest  
In all her glorious garments dressed,  
There slept another whose small hand  
Had loosened every tie and band,  
In careless grace another lay  
Wide gems and jewels cast away,  
Like a young creeper when the tread  
Of the wild elephant has spread  
Confusion and destruction round,  
And cast it flowerless to the ground.  
Here lay a slumberer still as death,  
Save only that her balmy breath  
Raised ever and anon the lace  
that floated o'er her sleeping face.  
There, sunk in sleep, an amorous maid  
Her sweet head on a mirror laid,  
Like a fair lily bending till  
Her petals rest upon the rill.  
Another black-eyed damsel pressed  
Her lute upon her heaving breast,  
As though her loving arms were twined  
Round him for whom her bosom pined.  
Another pretty sleeper round  
A silver vase her arm's had wound  
That seemed, so fresh and fair and young  
A wreath of flowers that o'er it hung.  
In sweet disorder lay a throng  
Weary of dance and play and song,  
Where heedless girls had sunk to rest  
One pillowed on anothers breast  
Her tender cheek half seen beneath  
Bed roses of the falling wreath,  
The while her long soft hair concealed  
The beauties that her friend revealed.  
With limbs at random interlaced  
Bound arm and leg and throat and waist,  
Wreath of women lay asleep  
Blossoms in a careless heap.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_817"></span>[400:1b](ry350.htm#fr_817.md) Vis'vakarmá is the
architect of the Gods, the Hephaestos or Mulciber of the Indian heaven.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[400:2b](ry350.htm#fr_818.md) Rávan in the
resistless power which his long austerities had endowed him with, had
conquered his brother Kuvera the God of Gold and taken from him his
greatest treasure this enchanted car.

<span id="fn_819"></span>[400:3b](ry350.htm#fr_819.md) Like Milton's
heavenly car    'Itself instinct with spirit.'
