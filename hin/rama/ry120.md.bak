### CANTO XLII.: DAS'ARATHA'S LAMENT.

While yet the dust was seen afar  
That marked the course of Ráma's car,  
The glory of Ikshváku's race  
Turned not away his eager face.  
While yet his duteous son he saw  
He could not once his gaze withdraw,  
But rooted to the spot remained  
With eyes that after Ráma strained.  
But when that dust no more he viewed,  
Fainting he fell by grief subdued.  

To his right hand Kaus'alyá went,  
And ready aid the lady lent,  
While Bharat's loving mother tried  
To raise him on the other side.  
The king, within whose ordered soul  
Justice and virtue held control,  
To Queen Kaikeyí turned and said,  
With every sense disquieted:  
'Touch me not, thou whose soul can plot  
All sin. Kaikeyí, touch me not.  
No loving wife, no friend to me,  
I ne'er again would look on thee;  
Ne'er from this day have aught to do  
With thee and all thy retinue;  
Thee whom no virtuous thoughts restrain,  
Whose selfish heart seeks only gain.  
The hand I laid in mine, O dame,  
The steps we took around the flame,  <span
id="fr_317"></span>[1b](#fn_317.md)  
And all that links thy life to mine  
Here and hereafter I resign.  
If Bharat too, thy darling son,  
Joy in the rule thy art has won,  
Ne'er may the funeral offerings paid  
By his false hand approach my shade.'  
   Then while the dust upon him hung,  
The monarch to Kaus'alyá clung,  
And she with mournful steps and slow  
Turned to the palace, worn with woe.  
As one whose hand has touched the fire,  
Or slain a Bráhman in his ire,  
He felt his heart with sorrow torn  
Still thinking of his son forlorn.  
Each step was torture, as the road  
The traces of the chariot showed,  
And as the shadowed sun grows dim  
So cure and anguish darkened him.  
He raised a cry, by woe distraught,  
As of his son again he thought.  
And judging that the car had sped  
Beyond the city, thus he said:  
'I still behold the foot-prints made  
By the good horses that conveyed  
My son afar: these marks I see,  
But high-souled Ráma, where is he?  
Ah me, my son! my first and best,  
On pleasant conches wont to rest,  
With limbs perfumed with sandal, fanned  
By many a beauty's tender hand:  
Where will he lie with log or stone  
Beneath him for a pillow thrown,  
To leave at morn his earthy bed,  
Neglected, and with dust o'erspread,  
As from the flood with sigh and pant  
Comes forth the husband elephant?  
The men who make the woods their home  
Shall see the long-armed hero roam  
Roused from his bed, though lord of all,  
In semblance of a friendless thrall.  
Janak's dear child who ne'er has met  

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>  

With aught save joy and comfort yet,  
Will reach to-day the forest, worn  
And wearied with the brakes of thorn.  
Ah, gentle girl, of woods unskilled,  
How will her heart with dread be filled  
At the wild beasts' deep roaring there,  
Whose voices lift the shuddering hair!  
Kaikeyí, glory in thy gain,  
And, widow queen, begin to reign:  
No will, no power to live have I  
When my brave son no more is nigh.'  
   Thus pouring forth laments, the king,  
Girt by the people's crowded ring,  
Entered the noble bower like one  
New-bathed when funeral rites are done.  
Where'er he looked naught met his gaze  
But empty houses, courts, and ways.  
Closed were the temples: countless feet  
No longer trod the royal street,  
And thinking of his son he viewed  
Men weak and worn and woe-subdued.  
As sinks the sun into a cloud,  
So passed he on, and wept aloud,  
Within that house no more to be  
The dwelling of the banished three,  
Brave Ráma, his Videhan bride,  
And Lakshman by his brother's side:  
Like broad still waters, when the king  
Of all the birds that ply the wing  
Has swooped from heaven and borne away  
The glittering snakes that made them gay.  
With choking sobs and voice half spent  
The king renewed his sad lament:  
With broken utterance faint and low  
Scarce could he speak these words of woe:  
'My steps to Ráma's mother guide,  
And place me by Kaus'alyá's side:  
There, only there my heart may know  
Some little respite from my woe.'  
   The warders of the palace led  
The monarch, when his words were said,  
To Queen Kaus'alyá's bower, and there  
Laid him with reverential care.  
But while he rested on the bed  
Still was his soul disquieted.  
In grief he tossed his arms on high  
Lamenting with a piteous cry:  
'O Ráma, Ráma,' thus said he,  
'My son, thou hast forsaken me.  
High bliss awaits those favoured men  
Left living in Ayodhyá then,  
Whose eyes shall see my son once more  
Returning when the time is o'er.'  
Then came the night, whose hated gloom  
Fell on him like the night of doom.  
At midnight Das'aratha cried  
To Queen Kaus'alyá by his side:  
I see thee not, Kaus'alyá; lay  
Thy gentle hand in mine, I pray.  
When Ráma left his home my sight  
Went with him, nor returns to-night.'
