<P>
Then Kumbhakarna laughed aloud<BR>
And cried; 'O Monarch, once so proud,<BR>

<P>
We warned thee, but thou wouldst not hear<BR>
And now the fruits of sin appear.<BR>
We warned thee, I, thy nobles, all<BR>
Who loved thee, in thy council hall.<BR>
Those sovereigns who with blinded eyes<BR>
Neglect the foe their hearts despise,<BR>
Soon, falling from the their high estate<BR>
Bring on themselves the stroke of fate.<BR>
Accept at length, thy life to save,<BR>
The counsel sage Vibh&iacute;shan gave,<BR>
The prudent counsel spurned before,<BR>
And Sita to her lord restore.' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_989"></A><A HREF="#fn_989"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
The monarch frowned, by passion moved<BR>
And thus in angry words reproved:<BR>
' Wilt thou thine elder brother school,<BR>
Forgetful of the ancient rule<BR>
That bids thee treat him as the sage<BR>
Who guides thee with the lore of age?<BR>
Think on the dangers of the day,<BR>
Nor idly throw thy words away:<BR>
If, led astray, by passion stirred,<BR>
I in the pride of power have erred;<BR>
If deeds of old were done amiss.<BR>
No time for vain reproach is this.<BR>
Up, brother; let thy loving care<BR>
The errors of thy king repair.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To calm his wrath, his soul to ease,<BR>
The younger spake in words like these:<BR>
' Yea, from our bosoms let us cast<BR>
All idle sorrow for the past.<BR>
Let grief and anger be repressed:<BR>
Again be firm and self-possessed.<BR>
This day, O Monarch, shalt thou see<BR>
The V&aacute;nar legions turn and flee,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma and his brother slain<BR>
With their hearts' blood shall dye the plain<BR>
Yea, if the God who rules the dead,<BR>
And Varun their battalions led;<BR>
If Indra with the Storm-Gods came<BR>
Against me, and the Lord of Flame,<BR>
Still would I fight with all and slay<BR>
Thy banded foes, my King, to-day.<BR>
If Raghu's son this day withstand<BR>
The blow of mine uplifted hand.<BR>
Deep in his breast my darts shall sink,<BR>
And torrents of his life-blood drink.<BR>
O fear not, in my promise trust;<BR>
This arm shall lay him in the dust,<BR>
Shall leave the fierce Sugr&iacute;va dyed<BR>
With gore, and Lakshman by his side,<BR>
And strike the great Han&uacute;m&aacute;n down.<BR>
The spoiler of our glorious town.' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_990"></A><A HREF="#fn_990"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
