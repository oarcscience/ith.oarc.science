<P>
The wise Sumantra, thus addressed,<BR>
Unfolded at the king's behest<BR>
The plan the lords in council laid<BR>
To draw the hermit from the shade:<BR>
'The priest, amid the lordly crowd,<BR>
To Lomap&aacute;d thus spoke aloud:<BR>
'Hear, King, the plot our thoughts have framed,<BR>
A harmless trick by all unblamed.<BR>
Far from the world that hermit's child<BR>
Lives lonely in the distant wild:<BR>
A stranger to the joys of sense,<BR>
His bliss is pain and abstinence;<BR>
And all unknown are women yet<BR>
To him, a holy anchoret.<BR>
The gentle passions we will wake<BR>
That with resistless influence shake<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hearts of men; and he<BR>
Drawn by enchantment strong and sweet<BR>
Shall follow from his lone retreat,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And come and visit thee.<BR>
Let ships be formed with utmost care<BR>
That artificial trees may bear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And sweet fruit deftly made;<BR>
Let goodly raiment, rich and rare,<BR>
And flowers, and many a bird be there<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Beneath the leafy shade.<BR>
Upon the ships thus decked a band<BR>
Of young and lovely girls shall stand,<BR>
Rich in each charm that wakes desire,<BR>
And eyes that burn with amorous fire;<BR>
Well skilled to sing, and play, and dance<BR>
And ply their trade with smile and glance<BR>
Let these, attired in hermits' dress,<BR>
Betake them to the wilderness,<BR>
And bring the boy of life austere<BR>
A voluntary captive here.'<BR>

<P>
He ended; and the king agreed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By the priest's counsel won.<BR>
And all the ministers took heed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To see his bidding done.<BR>
In ships with wondrous art prepared<BR>
Away the lovely women fared,<BR>
And soon beneath the shade they stood<BR>
Of the wild, lonely, dreary wood.<BR>
And there the leafy cot they found<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Where dwelt the devotee,<BR>
And looked with eager eyes around<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hermit's son to see.<BR>
Still, of Vibh&aacute;ndak sore afraid,<BR>
They hid behind the creepers' shade.<BR>
But when by careful watch they knew<BR>
The elder saint was far from view,<BR>
With bolder steps they ventured nigh<BR>
To catch the youthful hermit's eye.<BR>
Then all the damsels, blithe and gay,<BR>
At various games began to play.<BR>
They tossed the flying ball about<BR>
With dance and song and merry shout,<BR>
And moved, their scented tresses bound<BR>
With wreaths, in mazy motion round.<BR>
Some girls as if by love possessed,<BR>
Sank to the earth in feigned unrest,<BR>
Up starting quickly to pursue<BR>
Their intermitted game anew.<BR>
It was a lovely sight to see<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Those fair ones, as they played,<BR>
While fragrant robes were floating free,<BR>
And bracelets clashing in their glee<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A pleasant tinkling made.<BR>
The anklet's chime, the Ko&iuml;l's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> cry<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With music filled the place<BR>
As 'twere some city in the sky<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Which heavenly minstrels grace.<BR>
With each voluptuous art they strove<BR>
To win the tenant of the grove,<BR>
And with their graceful forms inspire<BR>
His modest soul with soft desire.<BR>
With arch of brow, with beck and smile,<BR>
With every passion-waking wile<BR>


<P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of glance and lotus hand,<BR>
With all enticements that excite<BR>
The longing for unknown delight<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Which boys in vain withstand.<BR>
Forth came the hermit's son to view<BR>
The wondrous sight to him so new,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And gazed in rapt surprise,<BR>
For from his natal hour till then<BR>
On woman or the sons of men<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ne'er had cast his eyes.<BR>
He saw them with their waists so slim,<BR>
With fairest shape and faultless limb,<BR>
In variegated robes arrayed,<BR>
And sweetly singing as they played.<BR>
Near and more near the hermit drew,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And watched them at their game,<BR>
And stronger still the impulse grew<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To question whence they came.<BR>
They marked the young ascetic gaze<BR>
With curious eye and wild amaze,<BR>
And sweet the long-eyed damsels sang,<BR>
And shrill their merry laughter rang,<BR>
Then came they nearer to his side,<BR>
And languishing with passion cried:<BR>
'Whose son, O youth, and who art thou,<BR>
Come suddenly to join us now?<BR>
And why dost thou all lonely dwell<BR>
In the wild wood? We pray thee, tell,<BR>
We wish to know thee, gentle youth;<BR>
Come, tell us, if thou wilt, the truth.'<BR>

<P>
He gazed upon that sight he ne'er<BR>
Had seen before, of girls so fair,<BR>
And out of love a longing rose<BR>
His sire and lineage to disclose:<BR>
'My father,' thus he made reply,<BR>
'Is Kas'yap's son, a saint most high,<BR>
Vibh&aacute;ndak styled; from him I came,<BR>
And Rishya&#156;ring he calls my name,<BR>
Our hermit cot is near this place:<BR>
Come thither, O ye fair of face;<BR>
There be it mine, with honour due,<BR>
Ye gentle youths, to welcome you.'<BR>

<P>
They heard his speech, and gave consent,<BR>
And gladly to his cottage went.<BR>
Vibh&aacute;ndak's son received them well<BR>
Beneath the shelter of his cell<BR>
With guest-gift, water for their feet,<BR>
And woodland fruit and roots to eat,<BR>
They smiled, and spoke sweet words like these,<BR>
Delighted with his courtesies:<BR>
'We too have goodly fruit in store,<BR>
Grown on the trees that shade our door;<BR>
Come, if thou wilt, kind Hermit, haste<BR>
The produce of our grove to taste;<BR>
And let, O good Ascetic, first<BR>
This holy water quench thy thirst.'<BR>
They spoke, and gave him comfits sweet<BR>
Prepared ripe fruits to counterfeit;<BR>
And many a dainty cake beside<BR>
And luscious mead their stores supplied.<BR>
The seeming fruits, in taste and look,<BR>
The unsuspecting hermit took,<BR>
For, strange to him, their form beguiled<BR>
The dweller in the lonely wild.<BR>
Then round his neck fair arms were flung,<BR>
And there the laughing damsels clung,<BR>
And pressing nearer and more near<BR>
With sweet lips whispered at his ear;<BR>
While rounded limb and swelling breast<BR>
The youthful hermit softly pressed.<BR>
The pleasing charm of that strange bowl,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The touch of a tender limb,<BR>
Over his yielding spirit stole<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And sweetly vanquished him.<BR>
But vows, they said, must now be paid;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They bade the boy farewell,<BR>
And, of the aged saint afraid,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Prepared to leave the dell.<BR>
With ready guile they told him where<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Their hermit dwelling lay:<BR>
Then, lest the sire should find them there,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sped by wild paths away.<BR>
They fled and left him there alone<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By longing love possessed;<BR>
And with a heart no more his own<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He roamed about distressed.<BR>
The aged saint came home, to find<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hermit boy distraught,<BR>
Revolving in his troubled mind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  One solitary thought.<BR>
'Why dost thou not, my son,' he cried,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Thy due obeisance pay?<BR>
Why do I see thee in the tide<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of whelming thought to-day?<BR>
A devotee should never wear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A mien so sad and strange.<BR>
Come, quickly, dearest child, declare<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The reason of the change.'<BR>
And Rishyas'ring, when questioned thus,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Made answer in this wise:<BR>
'O sire, there came to visit us<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Some men with lovely eyes.<BR>
About my neck soft arms they wound<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And kept me tightly held<BR>
To tender breasts so soft and round,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That strangely heaved and swelled.<BR>
They sing more sweetly as they dance<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Than e'er I heard till now,<BR>
And play with many a sidelong glance<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And arching of the brow.'<BR>
'My son,' said he, 'thus giants roam<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Where holy hermits are,<BR>
And wander round their peaceful home<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Their rites austere to mar.<BR>
I charge thee, thou must never lay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thy trust in them, dear boy:<BR>
They seek thee only to betray,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And woo but to destroy.'<BR>
Thus having warned him of his foes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That night at home he spent.<BR>
And when the morrow's sun arose<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Forth to the forest went.<BR>

<P>
But Rishyas'ring with eager pace<BR>
Sped forth and hurried to the place<BR>
Where he those visitants had seen<BR>
Of daintly waist and charming mien.<BR>
When from afar they saw the son<BR>
Of Saint Vibh&aacute;ndak toward them run,<BR>
To meet the hermit boy they hied,<BR>
And hailed him with a smile, and cried:<BR>
'O come, we pray, dear lord, behold<BR>
Our lovely home of which we told<BR>
Due honour there to thee we'll pay,<BR>
And speed thee on thy homeward way.'<BR>
Pleased with the gracious words they said<BR>
He followed where the damsels led.<BR>
As with his guides his steps he bent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That Br&aacute;hman high of worth,<BR>
A flood of rain from heaven was sent<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That gladdened all the earth.<BR>

<P>
Vibh&aacute;ndak took his homeward road,<BR>
And wearied by the heavy load<BR>
Of roots and woodland fruit he bore<BR>
Entered at last his cottage door.<BR>
Fain for his son he looked around,<BR>
But desolate the cell he found.<BR>
He stayed not then to bathe his feet,<BR>
Though fainting with the toil and heat,<BR>
But hurried forth and roamed about<BR>
Calling the boy with cry and shout,<BR>
He searched the wood, but all in vain;<BR>
Nor tidings of his son could gain.<BR>

<P>
One day beyond the forest's bound<BR>
The wandering saint a village found,<BR>
And asked the swains and neatherds there<BR>
Who owned the land so rich and fair,<BR>
With all the hamlets of the plain,<BR>
And herds of kine and fields of grain.<BR>
They listened to the hermit's words,<BR>
And all the guardians of the herds,<BR>
With suppliant hands together pressed,<BR>
This answer to the saint addressed:<BR>
The Angas' lord who bears the name<BR>
Of Lomap&aacute;d, renowned by fame,<BR>
Bestowed these hamlets with their kine<BR>
And all their riches, as a sign<BR>
Of grace, on Rishyas'ring: and he<BR>
Vibh&aacute;ndak's son is said to be.'<BR>
The hermit with exulting breast<BR>
The mighty will of fate confessed,<BR>
By meditation's eye discerned;<BR>
And cheerful to his home returned.<BR>

<P>
A stately ship, at early morn,<BR>
The hermit's son away had borne.<BR>
Loud roared the clouds, as on he sped,<BR>
The sky grew blacker overhead;<BR>
Till, as he reached the royal town,<BR>
A mighty flood of rain came down.<BR>
By the great rain the monarch's mind<BR>
The coming of his guest divined.<BR>
To meet the honoured youth he went,<BR>
And low to earth his head he bent.<BR>
With his own priest to lead the train,<BR>
He gave the gift high guests obtain.<BR>
And sought, with all who dwelt within<BR>
The city walls, his grace to win.<BR>
He fed him with the daintiest fare,<BR>
He served him with unceasing care,<BR>
And ministered with anxious eyes<BR>
Lest anger in his breast should rise;<BR>
And gave to be the Br&aacute;hman's bride<BR>
His own fair daughter, lotus-eyed.<BR>

<P>
Thus loved and honoured by the king,<BR>
The glorious Br&aacute;hman Rishyas'ring<BR>
Passed in that royal town his life<BR>
With S'&aacute;nt&aacute; his beloved wife.'<BR>

the harbinger of spring and love is a
universal favourite with Indian poets. His
voice when first heard in a glorious spring
morning is not unpleasant, but becomes
in the hot season intolerably wearisome
to European ears.</P>
