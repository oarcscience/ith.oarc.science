<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXVI.: D&Uacute;SHAN'S DEATH.</H3>
<P>
When D&uacute;shan saw his giant band<BR>
Slaughtered by R&aacute;ma's conquering hand,<BR>
He called five thousand fiends, and gave<BR>
His orders. Bravest of the brave,<BR>
Invincible, of furious might,<BR>
Ne'er had they turned their backs in flight.<BR>
They, as their leader bade them seize<BR>
Spears, swords, and clubs, and rocks, and trees.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Poured on the dauntless prince again<BR>
A ceaseless shower of deadly rain.<BR>
The virtuous R&aacute;ma, undismayed.<BR>
Their missiles with his arrows stayed,<BR>
And weakened, ere it fell, the shock<BR>
Of that dire hail of tree and rock,<BR>
And like a bull with eyelids closed,<BR>
The pelting of the storm opposed.<BR>

<P>
Then blazed his ire: he longed to smite<BR>
To earth the rovers of the night.<BR>
The wrath that o'er his spirit came<BR>
Clothed him with splendour as of flame,<BR>
While showers of mortal darts he poured<BR>
Fierce on the giants and their lord.<BR>
D&uacute;shan, the foeman's dusky dread,<BR>
By frenzied rage inspirited,<BR>
On Raghu's son his missiles cast<BR>
Like Indra's bolts which rend and blast.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma with a trenchant dart<BR>
Cleft D&uacute;shan's ponderous bow apart.<BR>
And then the gold-decked steeds who drew<BR>
The chariot, with four shafts he slew.<BR>
One crescent dart he aimed which shred<BR>
Clean from his neck the driver's head;<BR>
Three more with deadly skill addressed<BR>
Stood quivering in the giant's breast.<BR>
Hurled from his car, steeds, driver slain,<BR>
The bow he trusted cleft in twain,<BR>
He seized his mace, strong, heavy, dread,<BR>
High as a mountain's towering head.<BR>
With plates of gold adorned and bound,<BR>
Embattled Gods it crushed and ground.<BR>
Its iron spikes yet bore the stains<BR>
Of mangled foemen's blood and brains.<BR>
Its heavy mass of jagged steel<BR>
Was like a thunderbolt to feel,<BR>
It shattered, as on foes it fell,<BR>
The city where the senses dwell.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_470"></A><A HREF="#fn_470"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Fierce D&uacute;shan seized that ponderous mace<BR>
Like monstrous form of serpent race,<BR>
And all his savage soul aglow<BR>
With fury, rushed upon the foe.<BR>
But Raghu's son took steady aim,<BR>
And as the rushing giant came,<BR>
Shore with two shafts the arms whereon<BR>
The demon's glittering bracelets shone.<BR>
His arm at each huge shoulder lopped,<BR>
The mighty body reeled and dropped.<BR>
And the great mace to earth was thrown<BR>
Like Indra's staff when storms have blown,<BR>
As some vast elephant who lies<BR>
Shorn of his tusks, and bleeding dies,<BR>
So, when his arms were rent away,<BR>
Low on the ground the giant lay.<BR>
The spirits saw the monster die,<BR>
And loudly rang their joyful cry,<BR>
'Honour to R&aacute;ma! nobly done!<BR>
Well hast thou fought, Kakutstha's son!<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;  But the great three, the host who led,<BR>
Enraged to see their chieftain dead,<BR>
As though Death's toils were round them cast,<BR>
Rushed upon R&aacute;ma fierce and fast,<BR>
Mah&aacute;kap&aacute;la seized, to strike<BR>
His foeman down, a ponderous pike:<BR>
Sth&uacute;l&aacute;ksha charged with spear to fling,<BR>
Pram&aacute;thi with his axe to swing.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma saw, with keen darts he<BR>
Received the onset of the three,<BR>
As calm as though he hailed a guest<BR>
In each, who came for shade and rest.<BR>
Mah&aacute;kap&aacute;la's monstrous head<BR>
Fell with the trenchant dart he sped.<BR>
His good right hand in battle skilled<BR>
Sth&uacute;l&aacute;ksha's eyes with arrows tilled,<BR>
And trusting still his ready bow<BR>
He laid the fierce Pramathi low,<BR>
Who sank as some tall tree falls down<BR>
With bough and branch and leafy crown.<BR>
Then with five thousand shafts he slew<BR>
The rest of D&uacute;shan's giant crew:<BR>
Five thousand demons, torn and rent,<BR>
To Yama's gloomy realm he sent.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When Khara knew the fate of all<BR>
The giant band and D&uacute;shan's fall,<BR>
He called the mighty chiefs who led<BR>
His army, and in fury said:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Now D&uacute;shan and his armed train<BR>
Lie prostrate on the battle plain.<BR>
Lead forth an army mightier still,<BR>
R&aacute;ma this wretched man, to kill.<BR>
Fight ye with darts of every shape,<BR>
Nor let him from your wrath escape.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spoke the fiend, by rage impelled,<BR>
And straight his course toward R&aacute;ma held.<BR>
With S'yenag&aacute;m&iacute; and the rest<BR>
Of his twelve chiefs he onward pressed,<BR>
And every giant as he went<BR>
A storm of well-wrought arrows sent.<BR>
Then with his pointed shafts that came<BR>
With gold and diamond bright as flame,<BR>
Dead to the earth tht hero threw<BR>
The remnant of the demon crew.<BR>
Those shafts with feathers bright as gold,<BR>
Like flames which wreaths of smoke enfold,<BR>
Smote down the fiends like tall trees rent<BR>
By red bolts from the firmament.<BR>
A hundred shafts be pointed well:<BR>
By their keen barbs a hundred fell:<BR>
A thousand,--and a thousand more<BR>
In battle's front lay drenched in gore.<BR>
Of all defence and guard bereft,<BR>
With sundered bows and harness cleft.<BR>
Their bodies red with bloody stain<BR>
Fell the night-rovers on the plain,<BR>
Which, covered with the loosened hair<BR>
Of bleeding giants prostrate there,<BR>
Like some great altar showed, arrayed<BR>
For holy rites with grass o'erlaid.<BR>
The darksome wood, each glade and dell<BR>
Where the wild demons fought and fell<BR>
Was like an awful hell whose floor<BR>
Is thick with mire and flesh and gore.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus twice seven thousand fiends, a band<BR>
With impious heart and bloody hand,<BR>
By Raghu's son were overthrown,<BR>
A man, on foot, and all alone.<BR>
Of all who met on that fierce day,<BR>
Khara, great chief, survived the fray,<BR>
The monster of the triple head,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_471"></A><A HREF="ry225.htm#fn_471"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
And Raghu's son, the foeman'a dread.<BR>
The other demon warriors, all<BR>
Skilful and brave and strong and tall,<BR>
In front of battle, side by side,<BR>
Struck down by Lakshman's brother died.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When Khara saw the host he led<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Triumphant forth to fight<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Stretched on the earth, all smitten dead,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    By R&aacute;ma's nobler might,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Upon his foe he fiercely glared,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And drove against him fast,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like Indra when his arm is bared<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    His thundering bolt to cast.<BR>
