### CANTO CXVIII.: ANASÚYÁ'S GIFTS.

Thus by the holy dame addressed  
Who banished envy from her breast,  
Her lowly reverence Sítá paid,  
And softly thus her answer made:  
'No marvel, best of dames, thy speech  
The duties of a wife should teach;  

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>  

Yet I, O lady, also know  
Due reverence to my lord to show.  
Were he the meanest of the base,  
Unhonoured with a single grace,  
My husband still I ne'er would leave,  
But firm through all to him would cleave:  
Still rather to a lord like mine  
Whose virtues high-exalted shine,  
Compassionate, of lofty soul,  
Vith every sense in due control,  
True in his love, of righteous mind,  
Like a dear sire and mother kind.  
E'en as he ever loves to treat  
Kaus'alyá with observance meet,  
Has his behaviour ever been  
To every other honoured queen.  
Nay, more, a sonlike reverence shows  
The noble Ráma e'en to those  
On whom the king his father set  
His eyes one moment, to forget.  
Deep in my heart the words are stored,  
Said by the mother of my lord,  
When from my home I turned away  
In the lone fearful woods to stray.  
The counsel of my mother deep  
Impressed upon my soul I keep,  
When by the fire I took my stand,  
And Ráma clasped in his my hand.  
And in my bosom cherished yet,  
My friends' advice I ne'er forget:  
Woman her holiest offering pays  
When she her husband's will obeys.  
Good Sávitrí her lord obeyed,  
And a high saint in heaven was made,  
And for the self-same virtue thou  
Hast heaven in thy possession now.  
And she with whom no dame could vie,  
Now a bright Goddess in the sky,  
Sweet Rohiní the Moon's dear Queen,  
Without her lord is never seen:  
And many a faithful wife beside  
For her pure love is glorified.'  
   Thus Sítá spake: soft rapture stole  
Through Anasúyá's saintly soul:  
Kisses on Sítá's head she pressed,  
And thus the Maithil dame addressed:  
'I by long rites and toils endured  
Rich store of merit have secured:  
From this my wealth will I bestow  
A blessing ere I let thee go.  
So right and wise and true each word  
That from thy lips mine ears have heard,  
I love thee: be my pleasing task  
To grant the boon that thou shalt ask.'  
   Then Sítá marvelled much, and while  
Played o'er her lips a gentle smile,  
'All has been done, O Saint, she cried,  
And naught remains to wish beside.  
   She spake; the lady's meek reply  
Swelled Anasúyá's rapture high.  
'Sítá,' she said,' my gift to-day  
Thy sweet contentment shall repay.  
Accept this precious robe to wear,  
Of heavenly fabric, rich and rare,  
These gems thy limbs to ornament,  
This precious balsam sweet of scent.  
O Maithil dame, this gift of mine  
Shall make thy limbs with beauty shine,  
And breathing o'er thy frame dispense  
Its pure and lasting influence.  
This balsam on thy fair limbs spread  
New radiance on thy lord shall shed,  
As Lakshmí's beauty lends a grace  
To Vishnu's own celestial face.'  
   Then Sítá took the gift the dame  
Bestowed on her in friendship's name,  
The balsam, gems, and robe divine,  
And garlands wreathed of bloomy twine;  
Then sat her down, with reverence meet,  
At saintly Anasúyá's feet.  
The matron rich in rites and vows  
Turned her to Ráma's Maithil spouse,  
And questioned thus in turn to hear  
A pleasant tale to charm her ear:  
'Sítá, 'tis said that Raghu's son  
Thy hand, mid gathered suitors, won.  
I fain would hear thee, lady, tell  
The story as it all befell:  
Do thou repeat each thing that passed,  
Reviewing all from first to last.'  
   Thus spake the dame to Sítá: she  
Replying to the devotee,  
'Then, lady, thy attention lend,'  
Rehearsed the story to the end:  
   King Janak, just and brave and strong.  
Who loves the right and hates the wrong.  
Well skilled in what the law ordains  
For Warriors, o'er Videha reigns.  
Guiding one morn the plough, his hand  
Marked out, for rites the sacred land,  
When, as the ploughshare cleft the earth,  
Child of the king I leapt to birth.  
Then as the ground he smoothed and cleared,  
He saw me all with dust besmeared,  
And on the new-found babe, amazed  
The ruler of Videha gazed.  
In childless love the monarch pressed  
The welcome infant to his breast:  
'My daughter,' thus he cried, 'is she:'  
And as his child he cared for me.  
Forth from the sky was heard o'erhead  
As 'twere a human voice that said:  
'Yea, even so: great King, this child  
Henceforth thine own be justly styled.'  
Videha's monarch, virtuous souled,  
Rejoiced o'er me with joy untold,  
Delighting in his new-won prize,  
The darling of his heart and eyes.  
To his chief queen of saintly mind  
The precious treasure he consigned,  
And by her side she saw me grow,  
Nursed with the love which mothers know.'  

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>  

Then as he saw the seasons fly,  
And knew my marriage-time was nigh,  
My sire was vexed with care, as sad  
As one who mourns the wealth he had:  
'Scorn on the maiden's sire must wait  
From men of high and low estate:  
The virgin's father all despise,  
Though Indra's peer, who rules the skies.'  
More near he saw, and still more near,  
The scorn that filled his soul with fear,  
On trouble's billowy ocean tossed,  
Like one whose shattered bark is lost.  
My father knowing how I came,  
No daughter of a mortal dame.  
In all the regions failed to see  
A bridegroom meet to match with me.  
Each way with anxious thought he scanned,  
And thus at length the monarch planned:  
'The Bride's Election will I hold,  
With every rite prescribed of old.'  
It pleased King Varun to bestow  
Quiver and shafts and heavenly bow  
Upon my father's sire who reigned,  
When Daksha his great rite ordained.  
Where was the man might bend or lift  
With utmost toil that wondrous gift?  
Not e'en in dreams could mortal king  
Strain the great bow or draw the string.  
Of this tremendous bow possessed,  
My truthful father thus addressed  
The lords of many a region, all  
Assembled at the monarch's call:  
'Whoe'er this bow can manage, he  
The husband of my child shall be.'  
The suitors viewed with hopeless eyes  
That wondrous bow of mountain size,  
Then to my sire they bade adieu,  
And all with humbled hearts withdrew.  
At length with Vis'vámitra came  
This son of Raghu, dear to fame,  
The royal sacrifice to view.  
Near to my father's home he drew,  
His brother Lakshman by his side,  
Ráma, in deeds heroic tried.  
My sire with honour entertained  
The saint in lore of duty trained,  
Who thus in turn addressed the king:  
'Ráma and Lakshman here who spring  
From royal Das'aratha, long  
To see thy bow so passing strong.'  

Before the prince's eyes was laid  
That marvel, as the Bráhman prayed.  
One moment on the bow he gazed,  
Quick to the notch the string he raised,  
Then, in the wandering people's view,  
The cord with mighty force he drew.  
Then with an awful crash as loud  
As thunderbolts that cleave the cloud,  
The bow beneath the matchless strain  
Of arms heroic snapped in twain.  
Thus, giving purest water, he,  
My sire, to Ráma offered me.  
The prince the offered gift declined  
Till he should learn his father's mind;  
So horsemen swift Ayodhyá sought  
And back her aged monarch brought.  
Me then my sire to Ráma gave,  
Self-ruled, the bravest of the brave.  
And Urmilá, the next to me,  
Graced with all gifts, most fair to see,  
My sire with Raghu's house allied.  
And gave her to be Lakshman's bride.  
Thus from the princes of the land  
Lord Ráma won my maiden hand,  
And him exalted high above  
Heroic chiefs I truly love.
