### CANTO CXXVI.: BHARAT CONSOLED.

But Ráma bade the chariot stay,  
And halting in his airy way,  
In Bharadvá's holy shade  
His homage to the hermit paid.  
'O saint,' he cried, 'I yearn to know  
My dear Ayodhyá's weal and woe.  
O tell me that the people thrive,  
And that the queens are yet alive.'  
   Joy gleamed in Bhardvája's eye,  
Who gently smiled and made reply:  
'Thy brother, studious of thy will,  
Is faithful and obedient still.  
In tangled twine he coils his hair:  
Thy safe return is all his care.  
Before thy shoes he humbly bends,  
And to thy house and realm attends.  
When first these dreary years began,  
When first I saw the banished man,  
With Sitá, in his hermit coat,  
At this sad heart compassion smote.  
My breast with tender pity swelled:  
I saw thee from thy home expelled,  
Reft of all princely state, forlorn,  
A hapless wanderer travel-worn,  
Firm in thy purpose to fulfil  
Thy duty and thy father's will.  
But boundless is my rapture now:  
Triumphant, girt with friends, art thou.  
Where'er thy wandering steps have been,  
Thy joy and woe mine eyes have seen.  
Thy glorious deeds to me art known,  
The Bráhmans saved, the foes o'erthrown.  
Such power have countless seasons spent  
In penance and devotion lent.  
Thy virtues, best of chiefs, I know,  
And now a boon would fain bestow.  
This hospitable gift  <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1](ry498.htm#fn_1047.md)
receive:  
Then with the dawn my dwelling leave.'  
The bended head of Ráma showed  
His reverence for the grace bestowed;  
Then for each brave companion's sake  
He sought a further boon and spake:  
   'O let that mighty power of thine  
The road to fair Ayodhyá line  
With trees where fruit of every hue  
The Vánars' eye and taste may woo,  
And flowers of every season, sweet  
With stores of honeyed juice, may meet,'  
The hero ceased: the hermit bent  
His reverend head in glad assent;  
And swift, as Bharadvája willed,  
The prayer of Ráma was fulfilled.  
For many a league the lengthening road  
Trees thick with fruit and blossom showed  
With luscious beauty to entice  
The taste like trees of Paradise.  
The Vánars passed beneath the shade  
Of that delightful colonnade,  
Still tasting with unbounded glee  
The treasures of each wondrous tree.
