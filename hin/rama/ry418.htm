<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XIX.: VIBH&Iacute;SHAN'S COUNSEL.</H3>
<P>
When Raghu's son had owned his claim<BR>
Down from the air Vibh&iacute;shan came,<BR>
And with his four attendants bent<BR>
At R&aacute;ma's feet most reverent.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'O R&aacute;ma,' thus he cried, 'in me<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan, R&aacute;van's brother see.<BR>
By him disgraced thine aid I seek,<BR>
Sure refuge of the poor and weak.<BR>
From Lank&aacute;, friends, and wealth I fly.<BR>
And reft of all on thee rely.<BR>
On thee, the wretch's firmest friend,<BR>
My kingdom, joys, and life depend.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With glance of favour R&aacute;ma eyed<BR>
The R&aacute;kshas chief and thus replied:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'First from thy lips I fain would hear<BR>
Each brighter hope, each darker fear.<BR>
Speak, stranger, that I well may know<BR>
The strength and weakness of the foe.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: the R&aacute;kshas chief obeyed,<BR>
And thus in turn his answer made:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'O Prince, the Self-existent gave<BR>
This boon to R&aacute;van; he may brave<BR>
All foes in fight; no fiend or snake,<BR>
Gandharva, God, his life may take.<BR>
His brother Kumbhakarna vies<BR>
In might with him who rules the skies.<BR>
The captain of his armies--fame<BR>
Perhaps has taught the warrior's name--<BR>
Is terrible Prahanta, who<BR>
King Manibhadra's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_940"></A><A HREF="#fn_940"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> self o'erthrew.<BR>
Where is the warrior found to face<BR>
Young Indrajit, when armed with brace<BR>
And guard &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_941"></A><A HREF="#fn_941"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and bow he stands in mail<BR>
And laughs at spear and arrowy hail?<BR>
Within his city Lank&aacute; dwell<BR>
Ten million giants fierce and fell,<BR>
Who wear each varied shape at will<BR>
And eat the flesh of those they kill.<BR>
These hosts against the Gods he led.<BR>
And heavenly might discomfited.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then R&aacute;ma cried: 'I little heed<BR>
Gigantic strength or doughty deed.<BR>
In spite of all their might has done<BR>
The king, the captain, aud the son<BR>
Shall fall beneath my fury dead,<BR>
And thou shalt reign in R&aacute;van's stead.<BR>
He, though in depths of earth he dwell,<BR>
Or seek protection down in hell,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Or kneel before the Sire supreme,<BR>
His forfeit life shall ne'er redeem.<BR>
Yea, by my brothers' lives I swear,<BR>
I will not to my home repair<BR>
Till R&aacute;van and his kith and kin<BR>
Have paid in death the price of sin.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Vibh&iacute;shan bowed his head and cried:<BR>
'Thy conquering army will I guide<BR>
To storm the city of the foe,<BR>
And aid the tyrant's overthrow.'<BR>
Thus spake Vibh&iacute;shan: R&aacute;ma pressed<BR>
The R&aacute;kshas chieftain to his breast,<BR>
And cried to Lakshman:'Haste and bring<BR>
Sea-water for the new-made king.'<BR>
He spoke, and o'er Vibh&iacute;shan's head<BR>
The consecrating drops were shed<BR>
Mid shouts that hailed with one accord<BR>
The giants' king and Lank&aacute;'s lord,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Is there no way,' Han&uacute;m&aacute;n cried,<BR>
'No passage o'er the boisterous tide?<BR>
How may we lead the V&aacute;nar host<BR>
In triumph to the farther coast?<BR>
'Thus,' said Vibh&iacute;shan, 'I advise:<BR>
Let Raghu's son in suppliant guise<BR>
Entreat the mighty Sea to lend<BR>
His succour and this cause befriend.<BR>
His channels, as the wise have told,<BR>
By Sagar's sons were dug of old, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_942"></A><A HREF="ry419.htm#fn_942"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Nor will high-thoughted Ocean scorn<BR>
A prince of Sagar's lineage born.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased; the prudent counsel won<BR>
The glad assent of Raghu's son.<BR>
Then on the ocean shore a bed<BR>
Of tender sacred grass was spread,<BR>
Where R&aacute;ma at the close of day<BR>
Like fire upon an altar lay.<BR>
