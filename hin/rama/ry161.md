### CANTO LXXXIII.: THE JOURNEY BEGUN.

Then Bharat rose at early morn,  
And in his noble chariot borne  
Drove forward at a rapid pace  
Eager to look on Ráma's face.  
The priests and lords, a fair array,  
In sun-bright chariots led the way.  
Behind, a well appointed throng,  
Nine thousand elephants streamed along.  
Then sixty thousand cars, and then,  
With various arms, came fighting men.  
A hundred thousand archers showed  

In lengthened line the steeds they rode--  
A mighty host, the march to grace  
Of Bharat, pride of Raghu's race.  
Kaikeyí and Sumitrá came,  
And good Kaus'alyá, dear to fame:  
By hopes of Ráma's coming cheered  
They in a radiant car appeared.  
On fared the noble host to see  
Ráma and Lakshman, wild with glee,  
And still each other's ear to please,  
Of Ráma spoke in words like these:  
'When shall our happv eyes behold  
Our hero true, and pure, and bold,  
So lustrous dark, so strong of arm,  
Who keeps the world from woe and harm?  
The tears that now our eyeballs dim  
Will vanish at the sight of him,  
As the whole world's black shadows fly  
When the bright sun ascends the sky.'  
   Conversing thus their way pursued  
The city's joyous multitude,  
And each in mutual rapture pressed  
A friend or neighbour to his breast.  
Thus every man of high renown,  
And every merchant of the town,  
And leading subjects, joyous went  
Toward Ráma in his banishment.  
And those who worked the potter's wheel,  
And artists skilled in gems to deal;  
And masters of the weaver's art,  
And those who shaped the sword and dart;  
And they who golden trinkets made,  
And those who plied the fuller's trade;  
And servants trained the bath to heat,  
And they who dealt in incense sweet;  
Physicians in their business skilled.  
And those who wine and mead distilled;  
And workmen deft in glass who wrought,  
And those whose snares the peacock caught;  
With them who bored the ear for rings,  
Or sawed, or fashioned ivory things:  
And those who knew to mix cement,  
Or lived by sale of precious scent;  
And men who washed, and men who sewed,  
And thralls who mid the herds abode;  
And fishers of the flood, and they  
Who played and sang, and women gay;  
And virtuous Bráhmans, Scripture-wise,  
Of life approved in all men's eyes;  
These swelled the prince's lengthened train,  
Borne each in car or bullock wain.  
Fair were the robes they wore upon  
Their limbs where red-hued unguents shone.  
These all in various modes conveyed  
Their journey after Bharat made;  
The soldiers' hearts with rapture glowed,  
Following Bharat on his road,  
Their chief whose tender love would fain  
Bring his dear brother home again.  
With elephant, and horse, and car,  
The vast procession travelled far,

And came where Gangá's waves below  
The town of Sringavera  <span id="fr_361"></span>[1](ry162.htm#fn_361.md)
flow.  
There, with his friends and kinsmen nigh,  
Dwelt Guha, Ráma's dear ally,  
Heroic guardian of the land  
With dauntless heart and ready hand.  
There for a while the mighty force  
That followed Bharat stayed its course,  
Gazing on Gangá's bosom stirred  
By many a graceful water-bird.  
When Bharat viewed his followers there,  
And Gangá's water, blest and fair,  
The prince, who lore of words possessed,  
His councillors and lords addressed:  
'The captains of the army call:  
Proclaim this day a halt for all,  
That so to-morrow, rested, we  
May cross this flood that seeks the sea.  
Meanwhile, descending to the shore,  
The funeral stream I fain would pour  
From Gangá's fair auspicious tide  
To him, my father glorified.'  
   Thus Bharat spoke: each peer and lord  
Approved his words with one accord,  
And bade the weary troops repose  
In separate spots where'er they chose.  
There by the mighty stream that day,  
Most glorious in its vast array  
The prince's wearied army lay  
   In various groups reclined.  
There Bharat's hours of night were spent,  
While every eager thought he bent  
On bringing home from banishment  
His brother, great of mind.
