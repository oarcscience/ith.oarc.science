### CANTO LXX.: THE DEATH OF TRIS'IRAS.

Then raged the Rákshas chiefs, and all  
Burned to avenge Narántak's fall.  
Devántak raised his club on high  
And rushed at Angad with a cry.  
Behind came Tris'iras, and near  
Mahodar charged with levelled spear.  
There Angad stood to fight with three:  
High o'er his head he waved a tree,  
And at Devántak, swift and true  
As Indra's flaming bolt, it flew.  
But, cut by giant shafts in twain,  
With minished force it flew in vain.  
A shower of trees and blocks of stone  
From Angad's hand was fiercely thrown;  
But well his club Devántak plied  
And turned each rock and tree aside.  
Nor yet, by three such foes assailed,

The heart of Angad sank or quailed.  
He slew the mighty beast that bore  
Mahodar: from his head he tore  
A bleeding tusk, and blow on blow  
Fell fiercely on his Rákshas foe.  
The giant reeled, but strength regained,  
And furious strokes on Angad rained,  
Who, wounded by the storm of blows,  
Sank on his knees, but swiftly rose.  
Then Tris'iras, as up he sprang,  
Drew his great bow with awful clang,  
And fixed three arrows from his sheaf  
Full in the forehead of the chief.  
Hanúmán saw, nor long delayed  
To speed with Níla to his aid,  
Who at the three-faced giant sent  
A peak from Lanká's mountain rent.  
But Tris'iras with certain aim  
Shot rapid arrows as it came:  
And shivered by their force it broke  
And fell to earth with flash and smoke.  
Then as the Wind-God's son came nigh,  
Devántak reared his mace on high.  
Hanúmán smote him on the head  
And stretched the monstrous giant dead.  
Fierce Tris'iras with fury strained  
His bow, and showers of arrows rained  
That smote on Níla's side and chest:  
He sank a moment, sore distressed;  
But quickly gathered strength to seize  
A mountain with its crown of trees.  
Crushed by the hill, distained with gore,  
Mahodar fell to rise no more.  

Then Tris'iras raised high his spear  
Which chilled the trembling foe with fear  
And, like a flashing meteor through  
The air at Hanúmán it flew.  
The Vánar shunned the threatened stroke,  
And with strong hands the weapon broke.  
The giant drew his glittering blade:  
Dire was the wound the weapon made  
Deep in the Vánar's ample chest,  
Who, for a moment sore oppressed,  
Raised his broad hand, regaining might,  
And struck the rover of the night.  
Fierce was the blow: with one wild yell  
Low on the earth the monster fell,  
Hanúmán seized his fallen sword  
Which served no more its senseless lord,  
And from the monger triple-necked  
Smote his huge heads with crowns bedecked.  
Then Mahápárs'va burned with ire;  
Fierce flashed his eyes with vengeful fire.  
A moment on the dead he gazed,  
Then his black mace aloft was raised,  
And down the mass of iron came  
That struck and shook the Vánar's frame.  
Hanúmán's chest was wellnigh crushed,  
And from his mouth red torrents gushed:  
Yet served one instant to restore  

His spirit: from the foe he tore  
His awful mace, and smote, and laid  
The giant in the dust dismayed.  
Crushed were his jaws and teeth and eyes:  
Breathless and still he lay as lies  
A summit from a mountain rent  
By him who rules the firmament.
