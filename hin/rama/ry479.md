### CANTO CVIII.: THE BATTLE.

He spoke, and vanished: Ráma raised  
His eyes with reverence meet, and praised  
The glorious Day-God full in view:  
Then armed him for the fight anew.  
Urged onward by his charioteer  
The giant's foaming steeds came near,  
And furious was the battle's din  
Where each resolved to die or win.  
The Rákshas host and Vánar bands  
Stood with their weapons in their hands,  
And watched in terror and dismay  
The fortune of the awful fray.  
The giant chief with rage inflamed  
His darts at Ráma's pennon aimed;  
But when they touched the chariot made  
By heavenly hands their force was stayed.  
Then Ráma's breast with fury swelled;  
He strained the mighty bow he held.  
And straight at Rávan's banner flew  
An arrow as the string he drew--  
A deadly arrow swift of flight,  
Like some huge snake ablaze with light,  
Whose fury none might e'er repel,--  
And, split in twain, the standard fell.  
At Ráma's steeds sharp arrows, hot  
With flames of fire, the giant shot.  
Unmoved the heavenly steeds sustained  
The furious shower the warrior rained,  
As though soft lotus tendrils smote  
Each haughty crest and glossy coat,  
Then volleyed swift by magic art,  
Tree, mountain peak and spear and dart,  
Trident and pike and club and mace  
Flew hurtling straight at Ráma's face.  
But Ráma with his steeds and car  
Escaped the storm which fell afar  
Where the strange missiles, as they rushed  
To earth, a thousand Vánars crushed.
