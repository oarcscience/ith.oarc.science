### CANTO LXI.: THE VÁNARS' ALARM.

The son of Raghu near the wall  
Saw, proudly towering over all,  
The mighty giant stride along  
Attended by the warrior throng;  
Heard Kumbhakarna's heavy feet  
Awake the echoes of the street;  
And, with the lust of battle fired,  
Turned to and inquired:  
'Vibhíshan, tell that chieftain's name  
Who rears so high his mountain frame;  
With glittering helm and lion eyes,  
Preeminent in might and size  
Above the rest of giant birth,  
He towers the standard of the earth;  
And all the Vánars when they see  
The mighty warrior turn and flee.'  
   'In him,' Vibhíshan answered, 'know  
Vis'ravas' son, the Immortals' foe,  
Fierce Kumbhakaiiia, mightier far  
Than Gods and fiends and giants are.  
He conquered Yama in the fight,  
And Indra trembling owned his might.  
His arm the Gods and fiends subdued,  
Gandharvas and the serpent brood.  
The rest of his gigantic race  
Are wonderous strong by God-given grace;  

But nature at his birth to him  
Gave matchless power and strength of limb.  
Scarce was he born, fierce monster, when  
He killed and ate a thousand men.  
The trembling race of men, appalled,  
On Indra for protection called;  
And he, to save the suffering world,  
His bolt at Kumbhakarna hurled.  
So awful was the monster's yell  
That fear on all the nations fell,  
He, rushing on with furious roar,  
A tusk from huge Airávat tore,  
And dealt the God so dire a blow  
That Indra reeling left his foe,  
And with the Gods and mortals fled  
To Brahmá's throne dispirited.  
'O Brahmá,' thus the suppliants cried,  
'Some refuge for this woe provide.  
If thus his maw the giant sate  
Soon will the world be desolate.'  
The Self-existent calmed their woe,  
And spake in anger to their foe:  
'As thou wast born, Paulastya's son,  
That worlds might weep by thee undone,  
Thou like the dead henceforth shalt be:  
Such is the curse I lay on thee.'  
Senseless he lay, nor spoke nor stirred;  
Such was the power of Brahmá's word.  
But Rávan, troubled for his sake,  
Thus to the Self-existent spake:  
'Who lops the tree his care has reared  
When golden fruit has first appeared?  
Not thus, O Brahmá, deal with one  
Descended from thine own dear son. <span
id="fr_988"></span>[1](#fn_988.md)  
Still thou, O Lord, thy word must keep  
He may not die, but let him sleep.  
Yet fix a time for him to break  
The chains of slumber and awake.'  
He ceased: and Brahmá made reply;  
'Six months in slumber shall he lie  
And then arising for a day  
Shall cast the numbing bonds away.'  
Now Rávan in his doubt and dread  
Has roused the monster from his bed,  
Who comes in this the hour of need  
On slaughtered Vánars flesh to feed.  
Each Vánar, when his awe-struck eyes  
Behold the monstrous chieftain, flies.  
With hopeful words their minds deceive,  
And let our trembling hosts believe  
They see no giant, but, displayed,  
A lifeless engine deftly made.'  
   Then Ráma called to Nila: 'Haste,  
Let troops near every gate be placed,  
And, armed with fragments of the rock  
And trees, each lane and alley block.'  

<span id="page_475">p. 475</span>  

Thus Rama spoke: the chief obeyed,  
And swift the Vánars stood arrayed,  
As when the black clouds their battle form,  
The summit of a hill to storm
