<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XCVIII: LAKSHMAN CALMED.</H3>
<P>
Then R&aacute;ma nobly calm allayed<BR>
The wrath that Lakshman's bosom swayed:<BR>
'What need have we the sword to wield,<BR>
To bend the bow or lift the shield,<BR>
If Bharat brave, and wise, and good,<BR>
Himself has sought this sheltering wood?<BR>
I sware my father's will to do,<BR>
And if I now my brother slew<BR>
What gain in kingship should I find,<BR>
Despised and scorned by all mankind?<BR>
Believe me, e'en as I would shrink<BR>
From poisoned meat or deadly drink,<BR>
No power or treasure would I win<BR>
By fall of friend or kith or kin.<BR>
Brother, believe the words I speak:<BR>
For your dear sakes alone I seek<BR>
Duty and pleasure, wealth and gain:<BR>
A holy life, a happy reign.<BR>
If royal sway my heart desires,<BR>
My brothers' weal the wish inspires:<BR>
Their bliss and safety is my care,<BR>
By this uplifted bow I swear.<BR>
'Twere not so hard for me to gain<BR>
This broad land girdled by the main,<BR>
But even Indra's royal might<BR>
Should ne'er be mine in duty's spite,<BR>
If any bliss my soul can see<BR>
Deprived of dear S'atrughna, thee,<BR>
And Bharat, may the flame destroy<BR>
With ashy gloom the selfish joy.<BR>
Far dearer than this life of mine,<BR>
Knowing the custom of our line,<BR>
His heart with fond affection fraught,<BR>
Bharat Ayodhy&aacute;'s town resought,<BR>
And hearing when he came that I,<BR>
With thee and S&iacute;t&aacute;, forced to fly<BR>
With matted hair and hermit dress<BR>
Am wandering in the wilderness.<BR>
While grief his troubled senses storms,<BR>
And tender love his bosom warms,<BR>
From every thought of evil clear,<BR>
Is come to meet his brother here.<BR>
Some grievous words perchance he spoke<BR>
Kaikey&iacute;'s anger to provoke,<BR>
Then won the king, and comes to lay<BR>
Before my feet the royal sway.<BR>
Hither, methinks, in season due<BR>
Comes Bharat for an interview,<BR>
Nor in his secret heart has he<BR>
One evil thought 'gainst thee or me.<BR>
What has he done ere now, reflect!<BR>
How failed in love or due respect<BR>

<P>
To make thee doubt his faith and lay<BR>
This evil to his charge to-day?<BR>
Thou shouldst not join with Bharat's name<BR>
So harsh a speech and idle blame.<BR>
The blows thy tongue at Bharat deals,<BR>
My sympathizing bosom feels.<BR>
How, urged by stress of any ill,<BR>
Should sons their father's life-blood spill,<BR>
Or brother slay in impious strife<BR>
A brother dearer than his life?<BR>
If thou these cruel words hast said<BR>
By strong desire of empire led,<BR>
My brother Bharat will I pray<BR>
To give to thee the kingly sway.<BR>
'Give him the realm', my speech shall be,<BR>
And Bharat will, methinks, agree.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spoke the prince whose chief delight<BR>
Was duty, and to aid the right:<BR>
And Lakshman keenly felt the blame,<BR>
And shrank within himself for shame:<BR>
And then his answer thus returned,<BR>
With downcast eye and cheek that burned:<BR>
'Brother, I weep, to see thy face<BR>
Our sire himself has sought this place.'<BR>
Thus Lakshman spoke and stood ashamed,<BR>
And Rama saw and thus exclaimed:<BR>
'It is the strong-armed monarch: he<BR>
Is come, methinks, his sons to see,<BR>
To bid us both the forest quit<BR>
For joys for which he deems us fit:<BR>
He thinks on all our care and pain,<BR>
And now would lead us home again.<BR>
My glorious father hence will bear<BR>
Sita who claims all tender care.<BR>
I see two coursers fleet as storms,<BR>
Of noble breed and lovely forms.<BR>
I see the beast of mountain size<BR>
Who bears the king our father wise,<BR>
The aged Victor, march this way<BR>
In front of all the armed array.<BR>
But doubt and fear within me rise,<BR>
For when I look with eager eyes<BR>
I see no white umbrella spread,<BR>
World-famous, o'er the royal head.<BR>
Now, Lakshman, from the tree descend,<BR>
And to my words attention lend.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spoke the pious prince: and he<BR>
Descended from the lofty tree,<BR>
And reverent hand to hand applied,<BR>
Stood humbly by his brother's side.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The host, compelled by Bharat's care,<BR>
The wood from trampling feet to spare,<BR>
Dense crowding half a league each way<BR>
Encamped around the mountain lay.<BR>
Below the tall hill's shelving side<BR>
Gleamed the bright army far and wide<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Spread o'er the ample space,<BR>
By Bharat led who firmly true<BR>
In duty from his bosom threw<BR>
All pride, and near his brother drew<BR>
To win the hero's grace.<BR>
