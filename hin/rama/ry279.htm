<P>
From Rishyam&aacute;ka's rugged side<BR>
To Malaya's hills the V&aacute;nar hied<BR>

<P>
And to his royal chieftain there<BR>
Announced the coming of the pair:<BR>
'See here with Lakshman' R&aacute;ma stands<BR>
Illustrious in a hundred lands.<BR>
Whose valiant heart will never quail<BR>
Although a thousand foes assail;<BR>
King Das'aratha's son, the grace<BR>
And glory of Ikshv&aacute;ku's race.<BR>
Obedient to his father's will<BR>
He cleaves to sacred duty still.<BR>
With rites of royal pomp and pride<BR>
His sire the Fire-God gratified;<BR>
Ten hundred thousand kine he freed,<BR>
And priests enriched with ample meed;<BR>
And the broad land protected, famed<BR>
For truthful lips and passions tamed.<BR>
Through woman's guile his son has made<BR>
His dwelling in the forest shade,<BR>
Where, as he lived with every sense<BR>
Subdued in hermit abstinence,<BR>
Fierce R&aacute;van' stole his wife, and he<BR>
Is come a suppliant, lord, to thee.<BR>
Now let all honour due be paid<BR>
To these great chiefs who seek thine aid.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spake the V&aacute;nar prince, and, stirred<BR>
With friendly thoughts, Sugr&iacute;va heard.<BR>
The light of joy his face o'erspread,<BR>
And thus to Raghu's son he said:<BR>
'O Prince, in rules of duty trained,<BR>
Caring for all with love unfeigned,<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n's tongue has truly shown<BR>
The virtues that are thine alone.<BR>
My chiefest glory, gain, and bliss,<BR>
O stranger Prince, I reckon this,<BR>
That Raghu's son will condescend<BR>
To seek the V&aacute;nar for his friend.<BR>
If thou my true ally wouldst be<BR>
Accept the pledge I offer thee,<BR>
This hand in sign of friendship take,<BR>
And bind the bond we ne'er will break.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke, and joy thrilled R&aacute;ma's breast;<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va's hand he seized and pressed<BR>
And, transport beaming from his eye,<BR>
Held to his heart his new ally.<BR>
In wanderer's weed disguised no more,<BR>
His proper form Han&uacute;m&aacute;n wore.<BR>
Then, wood with wood engendering,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> came<BR>
Neath his deft hands the kindled flame.<BR>
Between the chiefs that fire he placed<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_329"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 329</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
With wreaths of flowers and worship graced.<BR>
And round its blazing glory went<BR>
The friends with slow steps reverent.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus each to other pledged and bound<BR>
In solemn league new transport found.<BR>
And bent upon his dear ally<BR>
The gaze he ne'er could satisfy.<BR>
'Friend of my soul art thou: we share<BR>
Each other's joy, each other's care;'<BR>
To us the bliss that thrilled his breast<BR>
Sugriva Raghu's son addressed.<BR>
From a high S&aacute;l a branch he tore<BR>
Which many a leaf and blossom bore,<BR>
And the fine twigs beneath them laid<BR>
A seat for him and R&aacute;ma made.<BR>
Then Hanum&aacute;n with joyous mind,<BR>
Son of the God who rules the wind,<BR>
To Lakshman gave, his seat to be,<BR>
The gay branch of a Sandal tree.<BR>
Then King Sugriva with his eyes<BR>
Still trembling with the sweet surprise<BR>
Of the great joy he could not hide,<BR>
To Raghu's noblest scion cried:<BR>
'O R&aacute;ma, racked with woe and fear,<BR>
Spurned by my foes, I wander here.<BR>
Reft of my spouse, forlorn I dwell<BR>
Here in my forest citadel.<BR>
Or wild with terror and distress<BR>
Roam through the distant wilderness.<BR>
Vext by my brother B&aacute;li long<BR>
My soul has borne the scathe and wrong.<BR>
Do thou, whose virtues all revere,<BR>
Release me from my woe and fear.<BR>
From dire distress tby friend to free<BR>
Is a high task and worthy thee.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke, and Raghu's son who knew<BR>
All sacred duties men should do.<BR>
The friend of justice, void of guile,<BR>
Thus answered with a gentle smile:<BR>
'Great V&aacute;nar, friends who seek my aid<BR>
Still find their trust with fruit repaid.<BR>
B&aacute;li, thy foe, who stole away<BR>
Thy wife this vengeful hand shall slay.<BR>
These shafts which sunlike flash and burn,<BR>
Winged with the feathers of the *ern,<BR>
Each swift of flight and sure and dread,<BR>
With even knot and pointed head,<BR>
Fierce as the crashing fire-bolt sent<BR>
By him who rules the firmament,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_556"></A><A HREF="#fn_556"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Shall reach thy wicked foe and like<BR>

<P>

<P>
Infuriate serpents hiss and strike.<BR>
Thou, V&aacute;nar King, this day shalt see<BR>
The foe who long has injured thee<BR>
Lie, like a shattered mountain, low,<BR>
Slain by the tempest of my bow.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;ma spake: Sugriva heard,<BR>
And mighty joy his bosom stirred:<BR>
As thus his champion he addressed:<BR>
'Now by thy favour, first and best<BR>
Of heroes, shall thy friend obtain<BR>
His realm and darling wife again<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Recovered from the foe.<BR>
Check thou mine elder brother's might;<BR>
That ne'er again his deadly spite<BR>
May rob me of mine ancient right,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Or vex my soul with woe.'<BR>
The league was struck, a league to bring<BR>
To S&iacute;t&aacute; fiends, and V&aacute;nar king &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_557"></A><A HREF="ry280.htm#fn_557"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Apportioned bliss and bale.<BR>
Through her left eye quick throbbings shot,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_558"></A><A HREF="ry280.htm#fn_558"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A><BR>
Glad signs the lady doubted not,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That told their hopeful tale.<BR>
The bright left eye of B&aacute;li felt<BR>
An inauspicious throb that dealt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  A deadly blow that day.<BR>
The fiery left eyes of the crew<BR>
Of demons felt the throb, and knew<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The herald of dismay.<BR>
