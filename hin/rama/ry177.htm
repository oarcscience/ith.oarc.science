<P>
Soon as the warriors took their rest<BR>
Obeying Bharat's high behest,<BR>
Thus Bharat to Satrughna spake:<BR>
'A band of soldiers with thee take,<BR>
And with these hunters o'er and o'er<BR>
The thickets of the wood explore.<BR>
With bow, sword, arrows in their hands<BR>
Let Guba with his kindred bands<BR>
Within this grove remaining trace<BR>
The children of Kakutstha's race.<BR>
And I meanwhile on foot will through<BR>
This neighbouring wood my way pursue,<BR>
With elders and the twice-born men,<BR>
And every lord and citizen.<BR>
There is, I feel, no rest for me<BR>
Till Rama's face again I see,<BR>
Lakshman, in arms and glory great,<BR>
And Sita born to happy fate:<BR>
No rest, until his cheek as bright<BR>
As the fair moon rejoice my sight,<BR>
No rest until I see the eye<BR>
With which the lotus petals vie;<BR>
Till on my head those dear feet rest<BR>
With signs of royal rank impressed;<BR>
None, till my kingly brother gain<BR>
His old hereditary reign,<BR>
Till o'er his limbs and noble head<BR>
The consecrating drops be shed.<BR>
How blest is Janak's daughter, true<BR>
To every wifely duty, who<BR>
Cleaves faithful to her husband's side<BR>
Whose realm is girt by Ocean's tide!<BR>
This mountain too above the rest<BR>
E'en as the King of Hills is blest,--<BR>
Whose shades Kakutstha's scion hold<BR>
As Nandan charms the Lord of Gold.<BR>
Yea, happy is this tangled grove<BR>
Where savage beasts unnumbered rove,<BR>
Where, glory of the Warrior race,<BR>
King Rama finds a dwelling-place.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Bharat, strong-armed hero spake,<BR>
And walked within the pathless brake.<BR>
O'er plains where gay trees bloomed he went,<BR>
Through boughs in tangled net-work bent,<BR>
And then from Rama's cot appeared<BR>
The banner which the flame upreared.<BR>
And Bharat joyed with every friend<BR>
To mark those smokv wreaths ascend:<BR>
'Here Rama dwells,' he thought; 'at last<BR>
The ocean of our toil is passed.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then sure that Rama's hermit cot<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Was on the mountain's side<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He stayed his army on the spot,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And on with Guha hied.<BR>
