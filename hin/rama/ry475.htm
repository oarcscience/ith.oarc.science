<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CI.: LAKSHMAN'S FALL.</H3>
<P>
When R&aacute;van saw his darts repelled,<BR>
With double rage his bosom swelled.<BR>
He summoned, wroth but undismayed,<BR>
A mightier charm to lend its aid.<BR>
And, fierce as fire before the blast,<BR>
A storm of missiles thick and fast,<BR>
Spear, pike and javelin, mace and brand,<BR>
Came hurtling from the giant's hand.<BR>
But, mightier still, the arms employed<BR>
By Raghu's son their force destroyed,<BR>
And every dart fell dulled and spent<BR>
By powers the bards of heaven had lent.<BR>
With his huge mace Vibh&iacute;shan slew<BR>
The steeds that Ravan'a chariot drew.<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;van hurled in deadly ire<BR>
A ponderous spear that flashed like fire:<BR>
But R&aacute;ma's arrows checked its way,<BR>
And harmless on the earth it lay,<BR>
The giant seized a mightier spear,<BR>
Which Death himself would shun with fear.<BR>
Vibh&iacute;shan with the stroke had died,<BR>
But Lakshman'a hand his bowstring plied,<BR>
And flying arrows thick as hail<BR>
Smote fiercely on the giant's mail.<BR>
Then R&aacute;van turned his aim aside,<BR>
On Lakshman looked and fiercely cried:<BR>
'Thou, thou again my wrath hast braved,<BR>
And from his death Vibh&iacute;shan saved.<BR>
Now in his stead this spear receive<BR>
Whose deadly point thy heart shall cleave.'<BR>

<P>
He ceased: he hurled the mortal dart<BR>
By Maya forged with magic art.<BR>
The spear, with all his fury flung.<BR>
Swift, flickering like a serpent's tongue,<BR>
Adorned with many a tinkling bell,<BR>
Smote Lakshman, and the hero fell.<BR>
When R&aacute;ma saw, he heaved a sigh,<BR>
A tear one moment dimmed his eye.<BR>
But tender grief was soon repressed<BR>
And thoughts of vengeance filled his breast.<BR>
The air around him flashed and gleamed<BR>
As from his bow the arrows streamed;<BR>
And Lank&aacute;'s lord, the foeman's dread,<BR>
O'erwhelmed with terror turned and fled.<BR>

of having arrows headed in the way
mentioned. Fanciful names for war-engines
and weapons derived from their resemblance
to various animals are not confined
to India. The "War-wolf" was
used by Edward I. at the siege of Brechin,
the "Cat-house" and the "Sow" were
used by Edwaid III. at the siege of Dunbar.</P>
