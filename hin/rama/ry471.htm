<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXV.: THE NIGHT ATTACK.</H3>
<P>
Sugr&iacute;va spake in words like these:<BR>
'Now, V&aacute;nar lords, the occasion seize.<BR>
For now, of sons and brothers reft,<BR>
To R&aacute;van little hope is left:<BR>
And if our host his gates assail<BR>
His weak defence will surely fail.'<BR>

<P>
At dead of night the V&aacute;nar bands<BR>
Rushed on with torches in their hands.<BR>
Scared by the coming of the host<BR>
Each giant warder left his post.<BR>
Where'er the V&aacute;nar legions came<BR>
Their way was marked with hostile flame<BR>
That spread in fury to devour<BR>
Palace and temple, gate and tower.<BR>
Down came the walls and porches, down<BR>
Came stately piles that graced the town.<BR>
In many a house the fire was red,<BR>
On sandal wood and aloe fed.<BR>
And scorching flames in billows rolled<BR>
O'er diamonds and pearls and gold.<BR>
On cloth of wool, on silk brocade,<BR>
On linen robes their fury preyed.<BR>
Wheels, poles and yokes were burned, and all<BR>
The coursers' harness in the stall;<BR>
And elephants' and chariots' gear,<BR>
The sword, the buckler, and the spear.<BR>
Scared by the crash of falling beams,<BR>
Mid lamentations, groans and screams<BR>

<P>
Forth rushed the giants through the flames<BR>
And with them dragged bewildered dames,<BR>
Each, with o'erwhelming terror wild,<BR>
Still clamping to her breast a child.<BR>
The swift fire from a cloud of smoke<BR>
Through many a gilded lattice broke,<BR>
And, melting pearl and coral, rose<BR>
O'er balconies and porticoes.<BR>
The startled crane and peacock screamed<BR>
As with strange light the courtyard gleamed,<BR>
And fierce unusual glare was thrown.<BR>
Cm shrinking wood and heated stone.<BR>
From burning stall and stable freed<BR>
Rushed frantic elephant and steed.<BR>
And goaded by the driving blaze<BR>
Fled wildly tbrough the crowded ways.<BR>
As earth with fervent heat will glow<BR>
When comes her final overthrow;<BR>
From gate to gate, from court to spire<BR>
Proud Lank&aacute; was one blaze of fire,<BR>
And every headland, rock and bay<BR>
Shone bright a hundred leagues away.<BR>
Forth, blinded by the heat and flame<BR>
Ran countless giants huge of frame;<BR>
And, mustering for fierce attack,<BR>
The V&aacute;nars charged to drive them back,<BR>
While shout and scream and roar and cry<BR>
Re&euml;choed through the earth and sky.<BR>
There Rama stood with stength renewed,<BR>
And ever, as the foe he viewed,<BR>
Shaking the distant regions rang<BR>
His mighty bow's tremendous clang.<BR>
Then through the gates Nikummbha hied,<BR>
And Kumbha by his brother's side,<BR>
Sent forth--the bravest and the best--<BR>
To battle by the king's behest.<BR>
There fought the chiefs in open field,<BR>
And Angad fell and Dwivid reeled.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va saw: by rage impelled<BR>
He crushed the bow which Kumbha held.<BR>
About his foe Sugr&iacute;va wound<BR>
His arms, and, heaving from the ground<BR>
The giant hurled him o'er the bank;<BR>
And deep beneath the sea he sank.<BR>
Like mandar hill with furious swell<BR>
Up leapt the waters where he fell.<BR>
Again he rose: he sprang to land<BR>
And raised on high his threatening hand:<BR>
Full on Sugr&iacute;va's chest it came<BR>
And shook the V&aacute;nar's massy frame,<BR>
But on the wounded bone he broke<BR>
His wrist--so furious was the stroke.<BR>
With force that naught could stay or check,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va smote him neath the neck.<BR>
The fierce blow crashed through flesh and bone<BR>
And Kumbha lay in death o'erthrown.<BR>
Nikumbha saw his brother die,<BR>
And red with fury flashed his eye.<BR>
He dashed with mighty sway and swing<BR>

<P>
His axe against the V&aacute;nar king;<BR>
But shattered on that living rock<BR>
It split in fragments at the shock.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, rising to the blow,<BR>
Raised his huge hand and smote his foe.<BR>
And in the dust the giant lay<BR>
Gasping in blood his soul away. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1010"></A><A HREF="ry472.htm#fn_1010"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
