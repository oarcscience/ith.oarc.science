<P>
Forth went the legions of the west:<BR>
And wise Sugr&iacute;va addressed<BR>
S'atabal, summoned from the crowd.<BR>
To whom the sovereign cried aloud:<BR>
'Go forth, O V&aacute;narf, go forth,<BR>
Explore the regions of the north.<BR>
Thy host a hundred thousand be,<BR>
And Yama's sons &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_735"></A><A HREF="#fn_735"><FONT SIZE="1">4b</FONT></A> attend on thee.<BR>
With dauntless courage, strength, and skill<BR>
Search every river, wood, and hill.<BR>
Through every land in order go<BR>
Right onward to the Hills of Snow.<BR>
Search mid the peaks that shine afar,<BR>
In woods of Lodh and Deod&aacute;r.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_736"></A><A HREF="#fn_736"><FONT SIZE="1">5b</FONT></A><BR>
Search if with Janak's daughter, screened<BR>
By sheltering rocks, there lie the fiend<BR>

<P>
The holy grounds of Soma tread<BR>
By Gods and minstrels visited.<BR>
Reach K&aacute;la's mount, and flats that lie<BR>
Among the peaks that tower on high.<BR>
Then leave that hill that gleams with ore,<BR>
And fair Sudars'an's heights explore.<BR>
Then on to Devasakh&aacute;t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_737"></A><A HREF="#fn_737"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> hie.<BR>
Loved by the children of the sky.<BR>
A dreary land you then will see<BR>
Without a hill or brook or tree,<BR>
A hundred leagues, bare, wild, and dread<BR>
In lifeless desolation, spread.<BR>
Pursue your onward way, and haste<BR>
Through the dire horrors of the waste<BR>
Until triumphant with delight<BR>
You reach Kail&aacute;sa'stering height.<BR>
There stands a palace decked with gold,<BR>
For King Kuvera &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_738"></A><A HREF="#fn_738"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> wrought of old,<BR>
A home the heavenly artist planned<BR>
And fashioned with his cunning hand.<BR>
There lotuses adorn the flood<BR>
With full-blown flower and opening bud<BR>
Where swans and mallards float, and gay<BR>
Apsarases &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_739"></A><A HREF="#fn_739"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> come down to play.<BR>
There King Vaisravan's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_740"></A><A HREF="#fn_740"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> self, the lord<BR>
By all the universe adored,<BR>
Who golden gifts to mortals sends,<BR>
Lives with the Guhyakas &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_741"></A><A HREF="#fn_741"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> his friends.<BR>
Search every cavern in the steep,<BR>
And green glens where the moonbeams sleep.<BR>
If haply in that distant ground<BR>
The robber and the dame be found.<BR>
Then on to Krauncha's hill, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_742"></A><A HREF="#fn_742"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and through<BR>
His fearful pass your way pursue:<BR>
Though dark and terrible the vale<BR>
Your wonted courage must not fail.<BR>
There through abyss and cavern seek,<BR>
On lofty ridge, and mountain peak.<BR>
On, on! pursue your journey still<BR>
By valley, lake, and towering hill.<BR>
Reach the North Kurus' land, where rest<BR>
The holy spirits of the blest;<BR>
Where golden buds of lilies gleam<BR>
Resplendent on the silver stream,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

And leaves of azure turkis throw<BR>
Soft splendour on the waves below.<BR>
Bright as the sun at early morn<BR>
Fair pools that happy clime adorn,<BR>
Where shine the loveliest flowers on stems<BR>
Of crystal and all valued gems.<BR>
Blue lotuses through all the land<BR>
The glories of their blooms expand,<BR>
And the resplendent earth is strown<BR>
With peerless pearl and precious stone.<BR>
There stately trees can scarce uphold<BR>
The burthen of their fruits of gold,<BR>
And ever flaunt their gay attire<BR>
Of flower and leaf like flames of fire.<BR>
All there sweet lives untroubled spend<BR>
In bliss and joy that know not end,<BR>
While pearl-decked maidens laugh, or sing<BR>
To music of the silvery string. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_743"></A><A HREF="ry318.htm#fn_743"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Still on your forward journey keep,<BR>
And rest you by the northern deep,<BR>
Where springing from the billows high<BR>
Mount Somagiri &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_744"></A><A HREF="ry318.htm#fn_744"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> seeks the sky,<BR>
And lightens with perpetual glow<BR>
The sunless realm that lies below.<BR>
There, present through all life's extent,<BR>
Dwells Brahm&aacute; Lord preeminent,<BR>
And round the great God, manifest<BR>
In Rudra &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_745"></A><A HREF="ry318.htm#fn_745"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> forms high sages rest.<BR>
Then turn, O V&aacute;narsrch no more,<BR>
Nor tempt the sunless, boundless shore.'<BR>
