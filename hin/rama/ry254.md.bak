### CANTO LVI.: SÍTÁ'S DISDAIN.

His words the Maithil lady heard  
Oppressed by woe but undeterred.  
Fear of the fiend she cast aside,  
And thus in noble scorn replied:  
'His word of honour never stained  
King Das'aratha nobly reigned,  
The bridge of right, the friend of truth.  
His eldest son, a noble youth,  
Is Ráma, virtue's faithful friend,  
Whose glories through the worlds extend.  
Long arms and large full eyes has he,  
Mv husband, yea a God to me.  
With shoulders like the forest king's,  
From old Ikshváku's line he springs.  
He with his brother Lakshman's aid  
Will smite thee with the vengeful blade.  
Hadst thou but dared before his eyes  
To lay thine hand upon the prize,  
Thou stretched before his feet hadst lain  
In Janasthán like Khara slain.  
Thy boasted rovers of the night  
With hideous shapes and giant might,--  
Like serpents when the feathered king  
Swoops down with his tremendous wing,--  
Will find their useless venom fail  
When Ráma's mighty arms assail.  
The rapid arrows bright with gold.  
Shot from the bow he loves to hold.  
Will rend thy frame from flank to flank  
As Gangá's waves erode the bank.  
Though neither God nor fiend have power  
To slay thee in the battle hour,  
Yet from his hand shall come thy fate,  
Struck down before his vengeful hate.  
That mighty lord will strike and end  
The days of life thou hast to spend.  
Thy days are doomed, thy life is sped  
Like victim's to the pillar led.  
Yea, if the glance of Ráma bright  
With fury on thy form should light,  
Thou scorched this day wouldst fall and die  

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>  

Like Káma slain by Rudra's eye. <span id="fr_507"></span>[1](#fn_507.md)  
He who from heaven the moon could throw,  
Or bid its bright rays cease to glow,--  
He who could drain the mighty sea  
Will set his darling Sítá free  
Fled is thy life, thy glory, fled  
Thy strength and power: each sense is dead.  
Soon Lanká widowed by thy guilt  
Will see the blood of giants spilt.  
This wicked deed, O cruel King,  
No triumph, no delight will bring.  
Thou with outrageous might and scorn  
A woman from her lord hast torn.  
My glorious husband far away,  
Making heroic strength his stay,  
Dwells with his brother, void of fear,  
In Dandak forest lone and drear.  
No more in force of arms confide:  
That haughty strength, that power and pride  
My hero with his arrowy rain  
From all thy bleeding limbs will drain.  
When urged by fate's dire mandate, nigh  
Comes the fixt hour for men to die.  
Caught in Death's toils their eyes are blind,  
And folly takes each wandering mind.  
So for the outrage thou hast done  
The fate is near thou canst not shun,--  
The fate that on thyself and all  
Thy giants and thy town shall fall.  
I spurn thee: can the altar dight  
With vessels for the sacred rite,  
O'er which the priest his prayer has said,  
Be sullied by an outcaste's tread?  
So me, the consort dear and true  
Of him who clings to virtue too,  
Thy hated touch shall ne'er defile,  
Base tyrant lord of Lanká's isle.  
Can the white swan who floats in pride  
Through lilies by her consort's side,  
Look for one moment, as they pass,  
On the poor diver in the grass?  
This senseless body waits thy will.  
To torture, chain, to wound or kill.  
I will not, King of giants, strive  
To keep this fleeting soul alive  
But never shall they join the name  
Of Sítá with reproach and shame.  
   Thus as her breast with fury burned  
Her bitter speech the dame returned.  
Such words of rage and scorn, the last  
She uttered, at the fiend she cast  
Her taunting speech the giant heard,  
And every hair with anger stired,  
Then thus with fury in his eye  
He made in threats his fierce reply  
'Hear Maithil lady, hear my speech  
\* to my words and ponder each  
\* thy head twelve months shall fly  

And thou thy love wilt still deny,  
My cooks shall mince thy flesh with steel  
And serve it for my morning meal.'  
   Thus with terrific threats to her  
Spake Rávan, cruel ravener.  
Mad with the rage her answer woke  
He called the fiendish train and spoke:  
'Take her, ye Rákshas dames, who fright  
With hideous form and mien the sight,  
Who make the flesh of men your food,--  
And let her pride be soon subdued.'  
He spoke, and at his word the band  
Of fiendish monsters raised each hand  
In reverence to the giant king,  
And pressed round Sítá in a ring.  
Rávan once more with stern behest  
To those she-fiends his speech addressed:  
Shaking the earth beneath his tread,  
He stamped his furious foot and said:  
'To the As'oka garden bear  
The dame, and guard her safely there  
Until her stubborn pride be bent  
By mingled threat and blandishment.  
See that ye watch her well, and tame,  
Like some she-elephant, the dame.'  
   They led her to that garden where  
The sweetest flowers perfumed the air,  
Where bright trees bore each rarest fruit,  
And birds, enamoured, ne'er were mute.  
Bowed down with terror and distress,  
Watched by each cruel giantess,--  
Like a poor solitary deer  
When ravening tigresses are near,--  
The hapless lady lay distraught  
Like some wild thing but newly caught,  
And found no solace, no relief  
From agonizing fear and grief;  
Not for one moment could forget  
Each terrifying word and threat,  
Or the fierce eyes upon her set  
   By those who watched around.  
She thought of Ráma far away,  
She mourned for Lakshman as she lay  
In grief and terror and dismay  
   Half fainting on the ground.
