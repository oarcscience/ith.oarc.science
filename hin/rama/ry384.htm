Mad with the rage of injured pride<BR>
King R&aacute;ven summoned to his side<BR>
The valiant *** who led his host,<BR>
Supreme in war and honoured most.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Go forth,' he cried, 'with car and steed,<BR>
A** **** feet this monkey lead.<BR>
But watch each chance of time and place<BR>
To seize this thing of silvan race.<BR>
For from his wondrous exploits he<BR>
No monkey of the woods can be,<BR>

But some new kind of creature meant<BR>
To work us woe, by Indra sent.<BR>
Gandharvas, N&aacute;gas, and the best<BR>
Of Yakshas have our might confessed.<BR>
Have we not challenged and subdued<BR>
The whole celestial multitude?<BR>
Yet will you not, if you are wise,<BR>
A chief of monkey race despise.<BR>
For I myself have B&aacute;li known,<BR>
And King Sugr&iacute;va's power I own.<BR>
But none of all their woodland throng<BR>
Was half so terrible and strong.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Obedient to the words he spake<BR>
They hastened forth the foe to take.<BR>
Swift were the cars whereon they rode,<BR>
And bright their weapons flashed and glowed.<BR>
They saw: they charged in wild career<BR>
With sword and mace and axe and spear.<BR>
From Durdhar's bow five arrows sped<BR>
And quivered in the V&aacute;nar's head.<BR>
He rose and roared; the fearful sound<BR>
Made all the region echo round.<BR>
Then from above his weight he threw<BR>
On Durdhar's car that near him drew.<BR>
The weight that came with lightning speed<BR>
Crushed pole and axle, car and steed.<BR>
It shattered Durdhar's head and neck,<BR>
And left him lifeless mid the wreck.<BR>
Y&uacute;p&aacute;ksha saw the warrior die,<BR>
And Vir&uacute;p&aacute;ksha heard his cry,<BR>
And, mad for vengeance for the slain,<BR>
They charged their V&aacute;nar foe again.<BR>
He rose in air: they onward pressed<BR>
And fiercely smote him on the breast.<BR>
In vain they struck his iron frame:<BR>
With eagle swoop to earth he came,<BR>
Tore from the ground a tree that grew<BR>
Beside him, and the demons slew.<BR>
Then Bh&aacute;sakama raised his spear,<BR>
And Praghas with a laugh drew near,<BR>
And, maddened at the sight, the two<BR>
Against the undaunted V&aacute;nar flew.<BR>
As from his wounds the torrents flowed,<BR>
Like a red sun the V&aacute;nar showed.<BR>
He turned, a mountain peak to seize<BR>
With all its beasts and snakes and trees.<BR>
He hurled it on the pair: and they<BR>
Crushed, overwhelmed, beneath it lay.<BR>
