<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XLIII.: KAUS'ALY&Aacute;'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
Kaus'aly&aacute; saw the monarch lie<BR>
With drooping frame and failing eye,<BR>
And for her banished son distressed<BR>
With these sad words her lord addressed:<BR>
'Kaikey&iacute;, cruel, false, and vile<BR>
Has cast the venom of her guile<BR>
On R&aacute;ma lord of men, and she<BR>
Will ravage like a snake set free;<BR>
And more and more my soul alarm,<BR>
Like a dire serpent bent on harm.<BR>
For triumph crowns each dark intent,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma to the wild is sent.<BR>
Ah, were he doomed but here to stray<BR>
Begging his food from day to day,<BR>
Or do, enslaved, Kaikey&iacute;'s will,<BR>
This were a boon, a comfort still.<BR>
But she, as chose her cruel hate,<BR>
Has hurled him from his high estate,<BR>
As Br&aacute;hmans when the moon is new<BR>
Cast to the ground the demons' due. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_318"></A><A HREF="#fn_318"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
The long-armed hero, like the lord<BR>
Of N&aacute;gas, with his bow and sword<BR>
Begins, I ween, his forest life<BR>
With Lakshman and his faithful wife.<BR>
Ah, how will fare the exiles now,<BR>
Whom, moved by Queen Kaikey&iacute;, thou<BR>
Hast sent in forests to abide,<BR>
Bred in delights, by woe untried?<BR>
Far banished when their lives are young,<BR>
With the fair fruit before them hung,<BR>
Deprived of all their rank that suits,<BR>
How will they live on grain and roots?<BR>
O, that my years of woe were passed,<BR>
And the glad hour were come at last<BR>
When I shall see my children dear,<BR>
R&aacute;ma, his wife, and Lakshman here!<BR>
When shall Ayodhy&aacute;, wild with glee,<BR>
Again those mighty heroes see,<BR>
And decked with wreaths her banners wave<BR>
To welcome home the true and brave?<BR>
When will the beautiful city view<BR>
With happy eyes the lordly two<BR>
Returning, joyful as the main<BR>
When the dear moon is full again?<BR>
When, like some mighty bull who leads<BR>
The cow exulting through the meads,<BR>
Will R&aacute;ma through the city ride,<BR>
Strong-armed, with S&iacute;t&aacute; at his side?<BR>
When will ten thousand thousand meet<BR>
And crowd Ayodhy&aacute;'s royal street,<BR>
And grain in joyous welcome throw<BR>
Upon my sons who tame the foe?<BR>
When with delight shall youthful bands<BR>
Of Br&aacute;hman maidens in their hands<BR>

Bear fruit and flowers in goodly show,<BR>
And circling round Ayodhy&aacute; go?<BR>
With ripened judgment of a sage,<BR>
And godlike in his blooming age,<BR>
When shall my virtuous son appear,<BR>
Like kindly rain, our hearts to cheer?<BR>
Ah, in a former life, I ween,<BR>
This hand of mine, most base and mean,<BR>
Has dried the udders of the kine<BR>
And left the thirsty calves to pine.<BR>
Hence, as the lion robs the cow,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; makes me childless now,<BR>
Exulting from her feebler foe<BR>
To rend the son she cherished so.<BR>
I had but him, in Scripture skilled,<BR>
With every grace his soul was filled.<BR>
Now not a joy has life to give,<BR>
And robbed of him I would not live:<BR>
Yea, all my days are dark and drear<BR>
If he, my darling, be not near,<BR>
And Lakshman brave, my heart to cheer.<BR>
As for my son I mourn and yearn,<BR>
The quenchless flames of anguish burn<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And kill me with the pain,<BR>
As in the summer's noontide blaze<BR>
The glorious Day-God with his rays<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Consumes the parching plain.&acute;<BR>
