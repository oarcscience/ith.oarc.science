### CANTO VI.  <span id="fr_810"></span>[1](#fn_810.md): THE COURT.

The palace gates were guarded well  
By many a Rákshas sentinel,  
And far within, concealed from view,  
Were dames and female retinue  
For charm of form and face renowned;  
Whose tinkling armlets made a sound,  
Clashed by the wearers in their glee,  
Like music of a distant sea.  
The hall beyond the palace gate,  
Rich with each badge of royal state,  

Where lines of noble courtiers stood,  
Showed like a lion-guarded wood.  
There the wild music rose and fell  
Of drum and tabor and of shell,  
Through chambers at each holy tide  
By solemn worship sanctified.  
Through grove and garden, undismayed,  
From house to house the Vánar strayed,  
And still his wondering glances bent  
On terrace, dome, and battlement:  
Then with a light and rapid tread  
Prahasta's  <span id="fr_811"></span>[1b](ry349.htm#fn_811.md) home he
visited,  
And Kumbhakarna's  <span id="fr_812"></span>[2b](ry349.htm#fn_812.md)
courtyard where  
A cloudy pile rose high in air;  
And, wandering o'er the hill, explored  
The garden of each Rákshas lord.  
Each court and grove he wandered through,  
Then nigh to Rávan's palace drew.  
She-demons watched it foul of face,  
Eace\* armed with sword and spear and mace,  
And warrior fiends of every hue,  
A strange and fearful retinue.  
There elephants in many a row,  
The terror of the stricken foe.  
Huge Airávat,  <span id="fr_813"></span>[3b](ry349.htm#fn_813.md) deftly
trained  
In battle-fields, stood ready chained.  
Fair litters on the ground were set  
Adorned with gems and golden net.  
Gay bloomy creepers clothed the walls;  
Green bowers were there and picture halls,  
And chambers made for soft delight.  
Broad banners waved on every height.  
And from the roof like Mandar's hill  
The peacock's cry came loud and shrill.  <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_810"></span>[399:1](ry348.htm#fr_810.md) I omit Canto V. which
corresponds to chapter XI. in Gorresio's edition. That scholar justly
observes: "The eleventh chapter, Description of Evening, is certainly
the work of the Rhapsodists and an interpolation of later date. The
chapter might be omitted without any injury to the action of the poem,
and besides the metre, style, conceits and images differ from the
general tenour of the poem; and that continual repetition of the same
sounds at the end of each hemistich which is not exactly rime, but
assonance, reveals the artificial labour of a more recent age.' The
following sample will probably be enough. I am unable to show the
difference of style in a translation:

  
Fair shone the moon, as if to lend  
His cheering light to guide a friend,  
And, circled by the starry host,  
Looked down upon the wild sea-coast.  
The Vánar cheiftain raised his eyes,  
And saw him sailing through the skies  
Like a bright swan who joys to take  
His pastime on a silver lake;  
Fair moon that calms the mourner's pain.  
Heaves up the waters of the main,  
And o'er the \*hie beneath him throws  
A tender light of soft repose,  
The charm that clings to Mandar's hill,  
Gleams in the sea when winds are still,  
And decks the lilly's opening flower,  
Showed in that moon her sweetest power.
