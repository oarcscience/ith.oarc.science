<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXVI.: SIT&Aacute;'S LAMENT</H3>
<P>
'I R&aacute;ma's wife, on that sad day.<BR>
By R&aacute;van's arm was borne away,<BR>
Seized, while I sat and feared no ill,<BR>
By him who wears each form at will,<BR>
A helpless captive, left forlorn<BR>
To demons' threats and taunts and scorn,<BR>
Here for my lord I weep and sigh,<BR>
And worn with woe would gladly die.<BR>
For what is life to me afar<BR>
From R&aacute;ma of the mighty car?<BR>
The robber in his fruitless sin<BR>
Would hope his captives love to win.<BR>
My meaner foot shall never touch<BR>
The demon whom I loathe so much.<BR>
The senseless fool! he knows me not,<BR>
Nor the proud soul his love would blot.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Yea, limb from limb will I be rent,<BR>
But never to his prayer consent;<BR>
Be burnt and perish in the fire,<BR>
But never meet his base desire.<BR>
My lord was grateful, true and wise,<BR>
And looked on woe with piting eyes;<BR>
But now, recoiling from the strife<BR>
He pities not his captive wife.<BR>
Alone in Janasth&aacute;n he slew<BR>
The thousands of the R&aacute;kshas crew.<BR>
His arm was strong, his heart was brave,<BR>
Why comes he not to free and save?<BR>
Why blame my lord in vain surmise<BR>
He knows not where his lady lies.<BR>
O, if he knew, o'er land and sea<BR>
His feet were swift to set me free;<BR>
This Lank&aacute;, girdled by the deep.<BR>
Would fall consumed, a shapeless heap,<BR>
And from each ruined home would rise<BR>
A R&aacute;kshas widow's groans and cries.'<BR>
