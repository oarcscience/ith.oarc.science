### CANTO CXX.: SÍTÁ RESTORED.

Thus spoke the Self-existent Sire:  
Then swiftly from the blazing pyre  
The circling flames were backward rolled,  
And, raising in his gentle hold  
Alive unharmed the Maithil dame,  
The Lord of Fire embodied came.  
Fair as the morning was her sheen,  
And gold and gems adorned the queen.  
Her form in crimson robes arrayed,  
Her hair was bound in glossy braid.  
Her wreath was fresh and sweet of scent,  
Undimmed was every ornament.  
Then, standing close to Ráma'a side,  
The universal witness cried:  
'From every blot and blemish free  
Thy faithful queen returns to thee.  
In word or deed, in look or mind  
Her heart from thee has ne'er declined.  
By force the giant bore away  
From thy lone cot his helpless prey;  
And in his bowers securely kept  
She still has longed for thee and wept.  
With soft temptation, bribe and threat,  
He bade the dame her love forget:  
But nobly faithful to her lord,  
Her soul the giant's suit abhorred.  
Receive, O King, thy queen again,  
Pure, ever pure from spot and stain.'  

Still stood the king in thoughtful mood  
And tears of joy his eyes bedewed.  
Then to the best of Gods the best  
Of warrior chiefs his mind expressed:  

'Twas meet that mid the thousands here  
The searching fire my queen should clear;  
For long within the giant's bower  
She dwelt the vassal of his power.  
For else had many a slanderous tongue  
Reproaches on mine honour flung,  
And scorned the king who, love-impelled,  
His consort from the proof withheld.  
No doubt had I, but surely knew  
That Janak's child was pure and true,  
That, come what might, in good and ill  
Her faithful heart was with me still.  
I knew that Rávan could not wrong  
Mv queen whom virtue made so strong.  
I knew his heart would sink and fail,  
Nor dare her honour to assail,  
As Ocean, when he raves and roars.  
Fears to o'erleap his bounding shores.  
Now to the worlds her truth is shown,  
And Sítá is again mine own.  
Thus proved before unnumbered eyes,  
On her pure fame no shadow lies.  
As heroes to their glory cleave,  
Mine own dear spouse I ne'er will leave.'

He ceased: and clasped in fond embrace  
On his dear breast she hid her face.
