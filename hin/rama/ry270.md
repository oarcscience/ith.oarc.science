### CANTO LXXII.: KABANDHA'S TALE.

'Lord of the mighty arm, of yore  
A shape transcending thought I wore,  
And through the triple world's extent  
My fame for might and valour went.  

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>  

Scarce might the sun and moon on high,  
Scarce Sakra, with ray beauty vie.  
Then for a time this form I took,  
And the great world with trembling shook  
The saints in forest shades who dwelt  
The terror of my presence felt.  
But once I stirred to furious rage  
Great Sthúlas'nas, glorious sage.  
Culling in woods his hermit food  
My hideous shape with fear he viewed.  
Then forth his words of anger burst  
That bade me live a thing accursed:  
'Thou, whose delight is others' pain,  
This grisly form shalt still retain.'  
Then when I prayed him to relent  
And fix some term of punishment,--  
Prayed that the curse at length might cease,  
He bade me thus expect release:  
'Let Ráma cleave thine arms away  
And on the pyre thy body lay,  
And then shalt thou, set free from doom,  
Thine own fair shape once more assume.'  
O Lakshman, hear my words: in me  
The world-illustrious Danu see.  
By Indra's curse, subdued in fight,  
I wear this form which scares the sight.  
By sternest penance long maintained  
The mighty Father's grace I gained.  
When length of days the God bestowed,  
With foolish pride my bosom glowed.  
My life, of lengthened years assured,  
I deemed from Sakra's might secured.  
Led by my senseless pride astray  
I challenged Indra to the fray.  
A flaming bolt with many a knot  
With his terrific arm he shot.  
And straight my head and thighs compressed  
Were buried in my bulky chest.  
Deaf to each prayer and piteous call  
He sent me not to Yama's hall.  
'These prayers and cries,' he said 'are vain.  
The Father's word must true remain  
But how my lengthened life be spent  
By one the bolt has \* and rent?  
How can I live' I cried, 'unfed  
With shattered face and thighs and head?'  
As thus I spoke his grace to crave  
Arms each a league in length he gave,  
And opened in my chest beneath  
This mouth supplied with fearful teeth.  
So my huge arms I used to cast  
Round woodland creatures as they passed,  
And fed within the forest here  
On lion, tiger, pard,\* and deer.  
Then Indra spake to soothe my grief:  
'When Rama and his brother chief  
From thy huge bulk those arms shall cleave,  
Then shall the skies thy sould recieve.'  
Disguised in this terrific shape  

I let no woodland thing escape,  
And still my longing sould was pleased  
Whene'er my arms a victim seized,  
For in these arms I fondly thought  
Would Ráma's self at last be caught.  
Thus hoping, toiling many a day  
I yearned to cast my life away,  
And here, my lord, thou standest now:  
Blessings be thine for none but thou  
Could cleave my arms with trenchant stroke:  
True are the words the hermit spoke.  
Now let me, best of warriors, lend  
My counsel, and thy plans befriend,  
And aid thee with advice in turn  
If thou with fire my corse wilt burn.'  
   As thus the mighty Danu prayed  
With offer of his friendly aid,  
While Lakshman gazed with anxious eye,  
The virtuous Ráma made reply:  
'Lakshman and I through forest shade  
From Janasthán a while had strayed.  
When none was near her, Rávan came  
And bore away my glorious dame,  
The giant's form and size unknown,  
I learn as yet his name alone.  
Not yet the power and might we know  
Or dwelling of the monstrous foe.  
With none our helpless feet to guide  
We wander here by sorrow tried.  
Let pity move thee to requite  
Our service in the funeral rite.  
Our hands shall bring the boughs that, dry  
Where elephants have rent them, lie,  
Then dig a pit, and light the fire  
To burn thee as the laws require.  
Do thou as meed of this declare  
Who stole my spouse, his dwelling where,  
0, if thou can. I pray thee say,  
And let this grace our deeds repay.'  
   Danu had lent attentive ear  
The words which Ráma spoke to hear,  
And thus, a speaker skilled and tried.  
To that great orator replied:  
' No heavenly lore my soul endows,  
Naught know I of thy Maithil spouse.  
Yet will I, when my shape I wear.  
Him who will tell thee all declare.  
Then, Ráma, will my lips disclose  
His name who well that giant knows  
But, till the flames my corse devour  
This hidden knowledge mocks my power.  
For through that curse's withering taint  
My knowledge now is small and faint  
Unknown the giant's very name  
Who bore away the Maithil dame  
Cursed for my evil deeds I wore  
A shape which all the worlds abhor.  
Now ere with wearied steeds the sun  
Through western skies his course have run,  
Deep in a pit my body lay  

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>  

And burn it in the wonted way.  
When in the grave my corse is placed,  
With fire and funeral honours graced,  
Then I, great chief, his name will tell  
Who knows the giant robber well.  
With him, who guides his life aright,  
In league of trusting love unite,  
And he, O valiant prince, will be  
A faithful friend and aid to thee.  
For, Ráma, to his searching eyes  
The triple world uncovered lies.  
For some dark cause of old, I ween,  
Through all the spheres his ways have been.'
