### CANTO IX.: VIBHÍSHAN'S COUNSEL.

A score of warriors  <span id="fr_924"></span>[1](#fn_924.md) forward
sprang,  
And loud the clashing iron rang  
Of mace and axe and spear and sword,  
As thus they spake unto their lord:  
'Their king Sugríva will we slay,  
And Raghu's sons, ere close of day,  
And strike the wretch Hanúmán down,  
The spoiler of our golden town.'  
   But sage Vibhíshan strove to calm  
The chieftains' fury; palm to palm  
He joined in lowly reverence, pressed  
Before them, and the throng addressed: <span
id="fr_925"></span>[2](#fn_925.md)  
   'Dismiss the hope of conquering one  
So stern and strong as Raghu's son.  
In due control each sense he keeps  
With constant care that never sleeps.  
Whose daring heart has e'er conceived  
The exploit Hanumán achieved,  
Across the fearful sea to spring,  
The tributary rivers' king?  
O Rákshas lords, in time be wise,  
Nor Ráma's matchless power despise.  
And say, what evil had the son  
Of Raghu to our monarch done,  
Who stole the dame he loved so well  
And keeps her in his citadel;  
If Kharu in his foolish pride  
Encountered Ráma, fought, and died,  
May not the meanest love his life  
And guard it in the deadly strife?  

The Maithil dame, O Rákshas King,  
Sore peril to thy realm will bring.  
Restore her while there yet is time,  
Nor let us perish for thy crime.  
O, let the Maithil lady go  
Ere the avenger bend his bow  
To ruin with his arrowy showers  
Our Lanká with her gates and towers.  
Let Janak's child again be free  
Ere the wild Vánars cross the sea,  
In their resistless might assail  
Our city and her ramparts scale.  
Ah, I conjure thee by the ties  
0f brotherhood, be just and wise.  
In all my thoughts thy good I seek,  
And thus my prudent counsel speak.  
Let captive Sitá be restored  
Ere, fierce as autumn's sun, her lord  
Send his keen arrows from the string  
To drink the life-blood of our king.  
This fury from thy soul dismiss,  
The bane of duty, peace, and bliss.  
Seek duty's path and walk therein,  
And joy and endless glory win.  
Restore the captive, ere we feel  
The piercing point of Ráma's steel.  
O spare thy city, spare the lives  
Of us, our friends, our sons and wives.'  
   Thus spake Vibhíshan wise and brave:  
The Rákshas king no answer gave,  
But bade his lords the council close,  
And sought his chamber for repose.
