### CANTO XXXV.: HANUMAN'S SPEECH.

With joyous heart she heard him tell  
Of the great lord she loved so well,  
And in sweet accents, soft and low,  
Spoke, half forgetful of her woe:  
'How didst thou stand by Ráma's side?  
How came my lord and thou allied?  
How met the people of the wood  
With men on terms of brotherhood?  
Declare each grace and regal sign  
That decks the lords of Raghu's line.  
Each circumstance and look relate  
Tell Ráma's form and speech, and gait.'  
   'Thy fear and doubt,' he cried, 'dispelled,  
Hear, lady, what mine eyes beheld.  
Hear the imperial signs that grace  
The glory of Ikshváku's race.  
With moon-bright face and lotus eyes,  
Most beautiful and good and wise,  
With sun-like glory round his head,  
Long-suffering as the earth we tread,  
He from all foes his realm defends.  
Yea, o'er the world his care extends.  
He follows right in all his ways,  
And ne'er from royal duty strays.  

He knows the lore that strengthens kings;  
His heart to truth and honour clings.  
Each grace and gift of form and mind  
Adorns that prince of human kind;  
And virtues like his own endue  
His brother ever firm and true.  
O'er all the land they roamed distaught,  
And thee with vain endeavour sought,  
Until at length their wandering feet  
Trod wearily our wild retreat.  
Our banished king Sugríva spied  
The princes from the mountain side.  
By his command I sought the pair  
And led them to our monarch there.  
Thus Ráma and Sugríva met,  
And joined the bonds that knit them yet,  
When each besought the other's aid,  
And friendship and alliance made.  
An arrow launched from Ráma's bow  
Laid Báli dead, Sugríva's foe.  
Then by commandment of our lord  
The Vánar hosts each land explored.  
We reached the coast: I crossed the sea  
And found my way at length to thee.'  <span
