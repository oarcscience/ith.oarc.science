<P>
But soon the baseless thought was spurned<BR>
And longing hope again returned:<BR>
'No: R&aacute;ma's wife is none of these,<BR>
No careless dame that lives at ease.<BR>
Her widowed heart has ceased to care<BR>
For dress and sleep and dainty fare.<BR>
She near a lover ne'er would lie<BR>
Though Indra wooed her from the sky.<BR>
Her own, her only lord, whom none<BR>
Can match in heaven, is Raghu's son.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then to the banquet hall intent<BR>
On strictest search his steps he bent.<BR>
He passed within the door, and found<BR>
Fair women sleeping on the ground,<BR>
Where wearied with the song, perchance,<BR>
The merry game, the wanton dance,<BR>
Each girl with wine and sleep oppressed<BR>

<P>

<P>
Had sunk her drooping head to rest.<BR>
That spacious hall from side to side<BR>
With noblest fare was well supplied,<BR>
There quarters of the boar, and here<BR>
Roast of the buffalo and deer,<BR>
There on gold plate, untouched as yet<BR>
The peacock and the hen were set.<BR>
There deftly mixed with gait and curd<BR>
Was meat of many a beast and bird,<BR>
Of kid and porcupine and hare,<BR>
And dainties of the sea and air.<BR>
There wrought of gold, ablaze with shine<BR>
Of precious stones, were cups of wine.<BR>
Through court and bower and banquet hall<BR>
The V&aacute;nared and viewed them all;<BR>
From end to end, in every spot,<BR>
For S&iacute;t&aacute; but found her not.<BR>
