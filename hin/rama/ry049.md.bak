### CANTO XLIX.: AHALYÁ FREED.

Then Ráma, following still his guide,  
Within the grove, with Lakshman, hied.  
Her vows a wondrous light had lent  
To that illustrious penitent.  
He saw the glorious lady, screened  
From eye of man, and God, and fiend,  
Like some bright portent which the care  
Of Brahmá launches through the air,  
Designed by his illusive art  
To flash a moment and depart:  
Or like the flame that leaps on high  
To sink involved in smoke and die:  

Or like the full moon shining through  
The wintry mist, then lost to view:  
Or like the sun's reflection, cast  
Upon the flood, too bright to last:  
So was the glorious dame till then  
Removed from Gods' and mortals' ken,  
Till--such was Gautam's high decree--  
Prince Ráma came to set her free.  

Then, with great joy that dame to meet,  
The sons of Raghu clapped her feet;  
And she, remembering Gautam's oath,  
With gentle grace received them both;  
Then water for their feet she gave,  
Guest-gift, and all that strangers crave.  

The prince, of courteous rule aware,  
Received, as meet, the lady's care.  
Then flowers came down in copious rain,  
And moving to the heavenly strain  
Of music in the skies that rang.  
The nymphs and minstrels danced and sang:  
And all the Gods with one glad voice  
Praised the great dame, and cried, 'Rejoice!  
Through fervid rites no more defiled,  
But with thy husband reconciled.'  
Gautam, the holy hermit knew--  
For naught escaped his godlike view--  
That Ráma lodged beneath that shade,  
And hasting there his homage paid.  
He took Ahalyá to his side.  
From sin and folly purified,  
And let his new-found consort bear  
In his austerities a share.  

Then Ráma, pride of Raghu's race,  
Welcomed by Gautam, face to face,  
Who every highest honour showed,  
To Mithilá pursued his road.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[61:1](ry048.htm#fr_218.md) Kumarila says:' In the
same manner, if it is said that Indra was the seducer of Ahalyá this
does not imply that the God Indra committed such a crime, but Indra
means the sun, and Ahalyá (from ahan and lí) the night; and as the night
is seduced and ruined by the sun of the morning, therefore is Indra
called the paramour of Ahalyá.' MAX MULLER, *History of Ancient Sanskrit
Literature*, p.530
