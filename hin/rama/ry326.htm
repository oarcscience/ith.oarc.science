<P>
'R&aacute;ma,' he cried, 'a prince whose sway<BR>
All peoples of the earth obey,<BR>
To Dandak's tangled forest came<BR>
With his brave brother and his dame.<BR>
From that dark shade of forest boughs<BR>
The giant R&aacute;van stole his spouse.<BR>
Our king Sugr&iacute;va's orders send<BR>
These V&aacute;nars forth to aid his friend,<BR>
That so the lady be restored<BR>
Uninjured to her sorrowing lord.<BR>
With Angad and the rest, this band<BR>
Has wandered through the southern land,<BR>
With careful search in every place<BR>
The lady and the fiend to trace<BR>
We roamed the southern region o'er,<BR>
And stood upon the ocean's shore.<BR>
By hunger pressed our strength gave way;<BR>
Beneath the spreading trees we lay,<BR>
And cried, worn out with toil and woe,<BR>
'No farther, comrades, can we go.'<BR>
Then as our sad eyes looked around<BR>
We spied an opening in the ground,<BR>
Where all was gloomy dark behind<BR>
The creeping plants that o'er it twined.<BR>
Forth trooping from the dark-recess<BR>
Came swans and mallards numberless,<BR>
With drops upon their shining wings<BR>
As newly bathed where water springs.<BR>
'On, comrades, to the cave,' I cried<BR>
And all within the portal hied.<BR>
Each clasping fast another's hand<BR>
Far onward pressed the V&aacute;nar band;<BR>
And still, as thirst and hunger drove,<BR>
We traced the mazes of the grove.<BR>
Here thou with hospitable care<BR>
Hast fed us with the noblest fare,<BR>
Preserving us, about to die,<BR>
With this thy plentiful supply.<BR>
But how, O pious lady, say,<BR>
May we thy gracious boon repay?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: the ascetic dame replied:<BR>
'Well, V&aacute;nars, am I satisfied.<BR>
A life of holy works I lead,<BR>
And from your hands no service need.'<BR>
Then spake again the V&aacute;nar chief:<BR>
'We came to thee and found relief.<BR>
Now listen to a new distress,<BR>
And aid us, holy votaress.<BR>
Our wanderings in this vasty cave<BR>
Exhaust the time Sugr&iacute;va gave.<BR>
Once more then, lady, grant release,<BR>
And let thy suppliants go in peace<BR>
Again upon their errand sped,<BR>
For King Sugr&iacute;va's ire we dread.<BR>
And the great task our sovereign set,<BR>
Alas, is unaccomplished yet.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus Hanum&aacute;n their leader prayed,<BR>
And thus the dame her answer made:<BR>
Scarce may the living find their way<BR>
Returning hence to light of day;<BR>
But I will free you through the might<BR>
Of penance, fast, and holy rite.<BR>
Close for a while your eyes, or ne'er<BR>
May you return to upper air.'<BR>
She ceased: the V&aacute;nars all obeyed;<BR>
Their fingers on their eyes they laid,<BR>
And, ere a moment's time had fled,<BR>
Were through the mazy cavern led.<BR>
Again the gracious lady spoke,<BR>
And joy in every bosom woke:<BR>
'Lo, here again is Vindhya's hill,<BR>
Whose valleys trees and creepers fill;<BR>
And, by the margin of the sea,<BR>
Prasravan where you fain would be.'<BR>
With blessings then she bade adieu,<BR>
And swift within the cave withdrew.<BR>
