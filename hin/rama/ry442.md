### CANTO XLIII.: THE SINGLE COMBATS.

Brave chiefs of each opposing side  
Their strength in single combat tried.  
Fierce Indrajit the fight began  
With Angad in the battle's van.  
Sampátí, strongest of his race,  
Stood with Prajangha face to face.  
Hanúmán, Jambumálí met  
In mortal opposition set.  
Vibhíshan, brother of the lord  
Of Lanká, raised his threatening sword  
And singled out, with eyes aglow  
With wrath, S'atrughna for his foe.  
The mighty Gaja Tapan sought,  
And Níla with Nikumbha fought.  
Sugríva, Vánar king, defied  
Fierce Praghas long in battle tried,  
And Lakshman fearless in the fight  
Encountered Virúpáksha's might.  
To meet the royal Ráma came  
Wild Agniketu fierce as flame;  
Mitraghana, he who loved to strike  
His foeman and his friend alike:  
With Ras'miketu, known and feared  
Where'er his ponderous flag was reared;  
And Yajnakopa whose delight  
Was ruin of the sacred rite.  
These met and fought, with thousands more,  
And trampled earth was red with gore  
Swift as the bolt which Indra sends  
When fire from heaven the mountain rends  
Smote Indrajit with furious blows  
On Angad queller of his foes.  
But Angad from his foeman tore  
The murderous mace the warrior bore,

And low in dust his coursers rolled,  
His driver, and his car of gold.  
Struck by the shafts Prajangha sped,  
The Vánar chief Sampáti bled,  
But, heedless of his gashes he  
Crushed down the giant with a tree.  
Then car-borne Jambumáli smote  
Hanumán on the chest and throat;  
But at the car the Vánar rushed,  
And chariot, steeds, and rider crushed.  
Sugríva whirled a huge tree round,  
And struck fierce Praghas to the ground.  
One arrow shot from Lakshman's bow  
Laid mighty Virúpáksha low.  
His giant foes round Ráma pressed  
And shot their shafts at head and breast;  
But, when the iron shower was spent,  
Four arrows from his bow he sent,  
And every missile, deftly sped;  
Cleft from the trunk a giant head.  <span
