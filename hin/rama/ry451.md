### CANTO LII.: DHÚMRÁKSHA'S DEATH.

The Vánars saw the giant foe  
Pour from the gate in gallant show,  

<span id="page_466">p. 466</span>  

Rejoiced with warriors' fierce delight  
And shouted, longing for the fight.  
Near came the hosts and nearer yet:  
Dire was the tumult as they met,  
As, serried line to line opposed,  
The Vánars and the giants closed.  
Fierce on the foe the Vánars rushed,  
And, wielding trees, the foremost crushed;  
But, feathered from the heron's wing,  
With eager flight from sounding string.  
Against them shot with surest aim  
A ceaseless storm of arrows came:  
And, pierced in head and chest and side,  
Full many a Vánar fell and died.  
They perished slain in fierce attacks  
With sword and pike and battle-axe;  
But myriads following undismayed  
Their valour in the fight displayed.  
Unnumbered Vánars rent and torn  
With shaft and spear to earth were borne.  
But crashed by branchy trees and blocks  
Of jagged stone and shivered rocks  
Which the wild Vánars wielded well  
The bravest of the giants fell.  
Their trampled banners strewed the fields,  
And broken swords and spears and shields;  
And, crushed by blows which none might stay,  
Cars, elephants, and riders lay.  
Dhúmráksha turned his furious eye  
And saw his routed legions fly.  
Still dauntless, with terrific blows,  
He struck and slew his foremost foes.  
At every blow, at every thrust,  
He laid a Vánar in the dust.  
So fell they neath the sword and lance  
In battle's wild Gandharva  <span id="fr_971"></span>[1](#fn_971)
dance,  
Where clang of bow and clash of sword  
Did duty for the silvery chord,  
And hoofs that rang and steeds that neighed  
Loud concert for the dancer made.  
So fiercely from Dhúmráksha's bow  
His arrows rained in ceaseless flow,  
The Vánar legions turned and fled  
To all the winds discomfited.  
Hanúmán saw the Vánars fly:  
He heaved a mighty rock on high.  
His keen eyes flashed with wrathful fire,  
And, rapid as the Wind his sire,  
Strong as the rushing tempests are,  
He hurled it at the advancing car.  
Swift through the air the missile sang:  
The giant from the chariot sprang,  
Ere crushed by that terrific blow  
Lay pole and wheel and flag and bow.  
Hanúmán's eyes with fury blazed:  
A mountain's rocky peak he raised,  

Poised it on high in act to throw,  
And rushed upon his giant foe.  
Dhúmráksha saw: he raised his mace  
And smote Hanúmán on the face,  
Who maddened by the wound's keen pang  
Again upon his foeman sprang;  
And on the giant's head the rock  
Descended with resistless shock.  
Crushed was each limb: a shapeless mass  
He lay upon the blood-stained grass.
