<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO VII.: R&Aacute;MA CONSOLED.</H3>
<P>
With longing love and woe oppressed<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chief he thus addressed:<BR>
And lie, while sobs his utterance broke,<BR>
Raised up his reverent hands and spoke:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'O Raghu's son, I cannot tell<BR>
Where now that cruel fiend may dwell,<BR>
Declare his power and might, or trace<BR>
The author of his cursed race.<BR>
Still trust the promise that I make<BR>
And let thy breast no longer ache.<BR>
So will I toil, nor toil in vain,<BR>
That thou thy consort mayst regain.<BR>
So will I work with might and skill<BR>
That joy anew thy heart shall fill:<BR>
The valour of my soul display,<BR>
And R&aacute;van and his legions slay.<BR>
Awake, awake! unmanned no more<BR>
Recall the strength was thine of yore.<BR>
Beseems not men like thee to wear<BR>
A weak heart yielding to despair.<BR>
Like troubles, too, mine eyes have seen,<BR>
Lamenting for a long-lost queen;<BR>
But, by despair unconquered yet,<BR>
My strength of mind I ne'er forget.<BR>
Far more shouldst thou of lofty soul<BR>
Thy passion and thy tears control,<BR>
When I, of V&aacute;nar's humbler strain,<BR>
Weep not for her in ceaseless pain.<BR>
Be firm, be patient, nor forget<BR>
The bounds the brave of heart have set<BR>
In loss, in woe, in strife, in fear,<BR>
When the dark hour of death is near.<BR>
Up? with thine own brave heart advise:<BR>
Not thus despond the firm and wise.<BR>
But he who gives his childish heart<BR>
To choose the coward's weakling part,<BR>
Sinks, like a foundered vessel, deep<BR>
In waves of woe that o'er him sweep.<BR>
See, suppliant hand to hand I lay,<BR>
And, moved by faithful love, I pray.<BR>
Give way no more to grief and gloom,<BR>
But all thy native strength resume.<BR>
No joy on earth, I ween, have they<BR>
Who yield their souls to sorrow's sway.<BR>
Their glory fades in slow decline:<BR>
'Tis not for thee to grieve and pine.<BR>
I do but hint with friendly speech<BR>
The wiser part I dare not teach.<BR>
This better path, dear friend, pursue,<BR>
And let not grief thy soul subdue.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sugr&iacute;va thus with gentle art<BR>
And sweet words soothed the mourner's heart,<BR>
Who brushed off with his mantle's hem<BR>
Tears from the eyes bedewed with them.<BR>

<P>
Sugr&iacute;va's words were not in vain,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma was himself again,<BR>
Around the king his arms he threw<BR>
And thus began his speech anew:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Whate'er a friend most wise and true,<BR>
Who counsels for the best, should do,<BR>
Whate'er his gentle part should be,<BR>
Has been performed, dear friend, by thee.<BR>
Taught by thy counsel, O my lord,<BR>
I feel my native strength restored.<BR>
A friend like thee is hard to gain.<BR>
Most rare in time of grief and pain.<BR>
Now strain thine utmost power to trace<BR>
The Maithil lady's dwelling place,<BR>
And aid me in my search to find<BR>
Fierce R&aacute;van of the impious mind.<BR>
Trust thou, in turn thy loyal friend,<BR>
And say what aid this arm can lend<BR>
To speed thy hopes, as fostering rain<BR>
Quickens in earth the scattered grain.<BR>
Deem not those words, that seemed to spring<BR>
From pride, are false, O V&aacute;nar King.<BR>
None from these lips has ever heard,<BR>
None e'er shall hear, one lying word.<BR>
Again I promise and declare,<BR>
Yea, by my truth, dear friend, I swear.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then glad was King Sugr&iacute;va's breast,<BR>
And all his lords their joy confessed,<BR>
Stirred by sure hope of R&aacute;ma's aid,<BR>
And promise which the prince had made.<BR>
