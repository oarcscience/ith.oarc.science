### CANTO XXXVI.: THE BIRTH OF GANGÁ.

The hours of night now waning fast  
On S'ona's pleasant shore they passed.  
Then, when the dawn began to break,  
To Ráma thus the hermit spake:  
'The light of dawn is breaking clear,  
The hour of morning rites is near,  
Rise, Ráma, rise, dear son, I pray,  
And make thee ready for the way.'  

Then Ráma rose, and finished all  
His duties at the hermit's call,  
Prepared with joy the road to take,  
And thus again in question spake:  
'Here fair and deep the S'ona flows,  
And many an isle its bosom shows:  
What way, O Saint, will lead us o'er  
And land us on the farther shore?  
The saint replied: 'The way I choose  
Is that which pious hermits use.'  

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>  

For many a league they journeyed on  
Till, when the sun of mid-day shone,  
The hermit-haunted flood was seen  
Of Jáhnaví,  <span id="fr_176"></span>[1](#fn_176.md) the Rivers' Queen.  
Soon as the holy stream they viewed,  
Thronged with a white-winged multitude  
Of sarases  <span id="fr_177"></span>[2](#fn_177.md) and swans,  <span
id="fr_178"></span>[3](#fn_178.md) delight  
Possessed them at the lovely sight:  
And then prepared the hermit band  
To halt upon that holy strand.  
They bathed as Scripture bids, and paid  
Oblations due to God and shade.  
To Fire they burnt the offerings meet,  
And sipped the oil, like Amrit sweet.  
Then pure and pleased they sate around  
Saint Vis'vámitra on the ground.  
The holy men of lesser note,  
In due degree, sate more remote,  
While Raghu's sons took nearer place  
By virtue of their rank and race.  
Then Ráma said: 'O Saint, I yearn  
The three-pathed Gangá's tale to learn.'  

Thus urged, the sage recounted both  
The birth of Gangá and her growth:  
'The mighty hill with metals stored,  
Himálaya, is the mountains' lord,  
The father of a lovely pair  
Of daughters fairest of the fair:  
Their mother, offspring of the will  
Of Meru, everlasting hill,  
Mená, Himálaya's darling, graced  
With beauty of her dainty waist.  
Gangá was elder-born: then came  
The fair one known by Umá's name.  
Then all the Gods of heaven, in need  
Of Gangá's help their vows to speed,  
To great Himálaya came and prayed  
The mountain King to yield the maid.  
He, not regardless of the weal  
Of the three worlds, with holy zeal  
His daughter to the Immortals gave,  
Gangá whose waters cleanse and save,  
Who roams at pleasure, fair and free,  
Purging all sinners, to the sea.  
The three-pathed Gangá thus obtained,  
The Gods their heavenly homes regained.  
Long time the sister Umá passed  
In vows austere and rigid fast,  
And the king gave the devotee  
Immortal Rudra's  <span id="fr_179"></span>[4](#fn_179.md) bride to be,  
Matching with that unequalled Lord  
His Umá through the worlds adored.  
So now a glorious station fills  

Each daughter of the King of Hills:  
One honoured as the noblest stream,  
One mid the Goddesses supreme.  
Thus Gangá, King Himálaya's child,  
The heavenly river, undefiled,  
Rose bearing with her to the sky  
Her waves that bless and purify.'
