He gathered next a chosen band<BR>
For service in the southern land.<BR>
He summoned N&iacute;la son of Fire,<BR>
And, offspring of the eternal Sire,<BR>

With Angad for their chief and guide.<BR>
'Go forth,' he cried, 'with all this host<BR>

The thousand peaks that Vindhya shows<BR>

Where Narmad&aacute;'s &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_692"></A><A HREF="#fn_692"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> sweet waters run,<BR>
And serpents bask them in the sun:<BR>

And sparkles fair God&aacute;vai&iacute;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_694"></A><A HREF="#fn_694"><FONT SIZE="1">4b</FONT></A><BR>

Where Dandak's woods their branches wave<BR>
Avomukh's,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_700"></A><A HREF="#fn_700"><FONT SIZE="1">10b</FONT></A> woody hill explore<BR>
Whose sides are bright with richest ore,.<BR>

Search well his forests where the breeze<BR>
Blows fragrant from the sandal trees.<BR>
Then will you see K&aacute;ver&iacute;'s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_701"></A><A HREF="#fn_701"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> stream<BR>
Whose pleasant waters glance and gleam,<BR>
And to the lovely banks entice<BR>
The sportive maids of Paradise.<BR>
High on the top of Malaya's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_702"></A><A HREF="#fn_702"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> hill,<BR>
In holy musing, calm and still,<BR>
Sits, radiant as the Lord of Light,<BR>
Agastya,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_703"></A><A HREF="#fn_703"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> noblest anchorite.<BR>
Soon as that lofty-thoughted lord<BR>
His high permission shall accord,<BR>
Pass T&aacute;mraparn&iacute;'s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_704"></A><A HREF="#fn_704"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> flood whose isles<BR>
Are loved by basking crocodiles.<BR>
The sandal woods that fringe her side<BR>
Those islets and her waters hide;<BR>
While, like an amorous matron, she<BR>
Speeds to her own dear lord the sea.<BR>
Thence hasting on your way behold<BR>
The P&aacute;ndyas'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_705"></A><A HREF="#fn_705"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> gates of pearl and gold.<BR>
Then, with your task maturely planned,<BR>
On ocean's shore your feet will stand.<BR>
Where, by Agastya's high decree,<BR>
Mahendra,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_706"></A><A HREF="#fn_706"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> planted in the sea,<BR>
With tinted peaks against the tide<BR>
Rises in solitary pride,<BR>
And glorious in his golden glow<BR>
Spurns back the waves that beat below.<BR>
Fair mountain, bright with creepers' bloom<BR>
And every tint that trees assume,<BR>
Where Yaksha, God, and heavenly maid<BR>
Meet wandering in the lovely shade,<BR>
At changing moon and solemn tide<BR>
By Indra's presence glorified.<BR>
One hundred leagues in fair extent<BR>
An island&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_707"></A><A HREF="#fn_707"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> fronts the continent:<BR>
No man may tread its glitering shore<BR>
With utmost heed that isle explore,<BR>
For the fair country owns the sway<BR>
Of R&aacute;van whom we burn to day.<BR>

A mighty monster stands to keep<BR>
The passage of the southern deep,<BR>
Lifting her awful arms on high<BR>
She grasps e'en shadows as they fly.<BR>
Speed through that isle, and onward still<BR>
Where in mid sea the Flowery Hill&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_708"></A><A HREF="#fn_708"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Haises on high his bloomy head<BR>
By saints and angels visited.<BR>
There, with a hundred gleaming peaks<BR>
Bright as the sun, the sky he seeks,<BR>
One glorious peak the Lord of Day<BR>
Gilds ever with his loving ray;<BR>
Thereon ne'er yet the glances fell<BR>
Of thankless wretch or infidel.<BR>
Bow to that hill in reverence due,<BR>
And then once more your search pursue.<BR>
Beyond that glorious mountain hie,<BR>
And S&uacute;ryav&aacute;n,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_709"></A><A HREF="#fn_709"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> proud hill is nigh.<BR>
Your rapid course yet farther bend<BR>
Where Vaidyut's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_710"></A><A HREF="#fn_710"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A> airy peaks ascend.<BR>
There trees of noblest sort, profuse<BR>
Of wealth, their kindly gifts produce.<BR>
Their precious fruits, O V&aacute;nars, taste,<BR>
The honey sip, and onward haste.<BR>
Next will ye see Mount Kunjar rise,<BR>
Who cheers with beauty hearts and eyes.<BR>
There is Agastya's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_711"></A><A HREF="#fn_711"><FONT SIZE="1">4b</FONT></A> mansion, decked<BR>
Bv heaven's all moulding architect.<BR>
Near Bhogavat&iacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_712"></A><A HREF="#fn_712"><FONT SIZE="1">5b</FONT></A> stands, the place<BR>
Where dwell the hosts of serpent race:<BR>
A broad-wayed city, walled and barred,<BR>
Which watchful legions keep and guard,<BR>
The fiercest of the serpent youth,<BR>
Each awful for his venomed tooth:<BR>
And throned in his imperial hall<BR>
Is V&aacute;suki&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_713"></A><A HREF="#fn_713"><FONT SIZE="1">6b</FONT></A> who rules them all.<BR>
Explore the serpent city well,<BR>
Search town and tower and citadel,<BR>
And scan each field and wood that lies<BR>
Around it, with your watchful eyes.<BR>
Beyond that spot your way pursue:<BR>
A noble mountain shall ye view,<BR>
Named Rishabh, like a mighty bull,<BR>
With gems made bright and beautiful.<BR>

All trees of sandal flourish there<BR>
Of heavenly fragrance, rich and rare.<BR>
But, though they tempt your longing eyes,<BR>
Avoid to touch them, and be wise.<BR>
For Rohitas, a guardian band<BR>
Of fierce Gandharvas, round them stand,<BR>
Who five bright sovereign lords&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_714"></A><A HREF="ry316.htm#fn_714"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> obey,<BR>
In glory like the God of Day.<BR>
Here by good deeds a home is won.<BR>
With shapes like fire, the moon, the sun.<BR>
Here they who merit heaven by worth<BR>
Dwell on the confines of the earth.<BR>
There stay; beyond it, dark and drear,<BR>
Lies the departed spirits' sphere,<BR>
And, girt with darkness, far from bliss,<BR>
Is Yama's sad metropolis.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_715"></A><A HREF="ry316.htm#fn_715"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
So far, my lords, o'er land and sea<BR>
Vour destined course is plain and free.<BR>
Beyond your steps you may not set,<BR>
Where living thing ne'er journeyed yet.<BR>
With utmost care these realms survey,<BR>
And all you meet upon the way.<BR>
And, when the lady's course is traced,<BR>
Back to your king, O V&aacute;nars, haste.<BR>
And he who tells me he has seen.<BR>
After long search, the Maithil queen,<BR>
Shall gain a noble guerdon: he<BR>
In power and bliss shall equal me.<BR>
Dear as my very life, above<BR>
His fellows in his master's love;<BR>
I call him, yea though stained with crime.<BR>
My kinsman from that happy time.'<BR>
