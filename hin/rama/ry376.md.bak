### CANTO XXXVI.: RÁMA'S RING.

'Receive,' he cried, 'this precious ring,  <span
id="fr_865"></span>[2b](#fn_865.md)  
Sure token from thy lord the king:  
The golden ring he wont to wear:  
See, Ráma's name engraven there.'  
Then, as she took the ring he showed,  
The tears that spring of rapture flowed.  
She seemed to touch the hand that sent  
The dearly valued ornament,  
And with her heart again at ease,  
Replied in gentle words like these:  
'O thou, whose soul no fears deter.  
Wise, brave, and faithful messenger!  
And hast thou dared, o'er wave and foam,  
To seek me in the giants' home!  
In thee, true messenger, I find  
The noblest of thy woodland kind.  
Who couldst, unmoved by terror, brook  
On Rávan, king of fiends, to look.  

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>  

Now may we commune here as friends,  
For he whom royal Ráma sends  
Must needs he one in danger tried,  
A valiant, wise, and faithful guide.  
Say, is it well with Ráma still?  
Lives Lakshman yet untouched by ill?  
Then why should Ráma's hand be slow  
To free his consort from her woe?  
Why spare to burn, in search of me,  
The land encircled by the sea?  
Can Bharat send no army out  
With banners, cars and battle shout?  
Cannot thy king Sugríva lend  
His legions to assist his friend?'  
   His hands upon his head he laid  
And thus again his answer made:  
'Not yet has Ráma learnt where lies  
His lady of the lotus eyes,  
Or he like Indra from the sky  
To S'achí's  <span id="fr_866"></span>[1](#fn_866.md) aid, to thee would
fly.  
Soon will he hear the tale, and then,  
Roused to revenge, the lord of men  
Will to the giants' island lead  
Fierce myriads of the woodland breed,  
Bridging his conquering way, and make  
The town a ruin for thy sake.  
Believe my words, sweet dame; I swear  
By roots and fruit, my woodland fare,  
By Meru's peak and Vindhva's chain,  
And Mandar of the Milky Main,  
Soon shalt thou see thy lord, though now  
He waits upon Prasravan's  <span id="fr_867"></span>[2](#fn_867.md) brow,  
Come glorious as the breaking morn,  
Like Indra on Airávat  <span id="fr_868"></span>[3](#fn_868.md) borne.  
For thee he looks with longing eyes;  
The wood his scanty food supplies.  
For thee his brow is pale and worn,  
For thee are meat and wine forsworn.  
Thine image in his heart he keeps,  
For thee by night he wakes and weeps.  
Or if perchance his eyes he close  
And win brief respite from his woes,  
E'en then the name of Sítá slips  
In anguish from his murmuring lips.  
If lovely flowers or fruit lie sees,  
Which women love, upon the trees,  
To thee, to thee his fancy flies.  
And 'Sítá! O my love!' he cries.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_864"></span>[414:1b](ry375.htm#fr_864.md) Sítá of course knows
nothing of what has happened to Ráma since the time when she was carried
away by Rávan, The poet therefore thinks it necessary to repeat the
whole story of the meeting between Ráma and Sugríva, the defeat of Báli,
and subsequent events. I give the briefest possible outline of the
story.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[414:2b](ry376.htm#fr_865.md) DE GUBERNATIS thinks
that this ring which the Sun Ráma sends to the Dawn Sítá is a symbol of
the sun's disc.

<span id="fn_866"></span>[415:1](ry376.htm#fr_866.md) S'achí is the loved
and lovely wife of Indra, and she is taken as the type of a woman
protected by a jealous and all-powerful husband.

<span id="fn_867"></span>[415:2](ry376.htm#fr_867.md) The mountain near
Kishkindhá.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[415:3](ry376.htm#fr_868.md) Airávat is the mighty
elephant on which Indra delights to ride.
