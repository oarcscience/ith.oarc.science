### CANTO LXXI.: JANAK'S PEDIGREE.

Then to the saint supremely wise  
King Janak spoke in suppliant guise:  
'Deign, Hermit, with attentive ear,  
Mv race's origin to hear.  
When kings a daughter's hand bestow,  
'Tis right their line and fame to show.  
There was a king whose deeds and worth  
Spread wide his name through heaven and earth,  

Nimi, most virtuous e'en from youth,  
The best of all who love the truth,  
His son and heir was Mithi, and  
His Janak, first who ruled this land.  
He left a son Udávasu,  
Blest with all virtues, good and true.  
His son was Nandivardhan, dear  
For pious heart and worth sincere.  
His son Suketu, hero brave,  
To Devarát, existence gave.  
King Devarát, a royal sage,  
For virtue, glory of the age,  
Begot Vrihadratha; and he  
Begot, his worthy heir to be,  
The splendid hero Mahábir  
Who long in glory governed here.  
His son was Sudhriti, a youth  
Firm in his purpose, brave in sooth,  
His son was Dhristaketu, blest  
With pious will and holy breast.  
The fame of royal saint he won:  
Haryas'va was his princely son.  
Haryas'va's son was Maru, who  
Begot Pratíndhak, wise and true.  
Next Kírtiratha held the throne,  
His son, for gentle virtues known.  
Then followed Devamidha, then  
Vibudh, Mahándhrak, kings of men.  
Mahándhrak's son, of boundless might,  
Was Kírtirát, who loved the right.  
He passed away, a sainted king,  
And Maháromá following  
To Swarnaromá left the state.  
Then Hras'varomá, good and great,  
Succeeded, and to him a pair  
Of sons his royal consort bare,  
Elder of these I boast to be:  
Brave Kus'adhwaj is next to me.  <span
id="fr_251"></span>[1b](#fn_251.md)  
Me then, the elder of the twain,  
My sire anointed here to reign.  
He bade me tend my brother well,  
Then to the forest went to dwell.  
He sought the heavens, and I sustained  
The burden as by law ordained,  
And noble Kus'adhwaj, the peer  
Of Gods, I ever held most dear.  
Then came Sánkás'yá's mighty lord,  
Sudhanvá, threatening siege and sword,  
And bade me swift on him bestow  
S'iva's incomparable bow,  

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>  

And Sítá of the lotus eyes:  
But I refused each peerless prize.  
Then, host to host, we met the foes,  
And fierce the din of battle rose,  
Sudhanvá, foremost of his band,  
Fell smitten by my single hand.  
When thus Sánkás'yá's lord was slain,  
I sanctified, as laws ordain,  
My brother in his stead to reign,  
Thus are we brothers, Saint most high  
The younger he, the elder I.  
Now, mighty Sage, my spirit joys  
To give these maidens to the boys.  
Let Sítá be to Ráma tied.  
And Urmilá be Lakshman's bride.  
First give, O King, the gift of cows,  
As dowry of each royal spouse,  
Due offerings to the spirits pay,  
And solemnize the wedding-day.  
The moon tonight, O royal Sage,  
In Maghá's <span id="fr_252"></span>[1](ry072.htm#fn_252.md) House takes
harbourage;  
On the third night his rays benign  
In second Phálguni <span id="fr_253"></span>[2](ry072.htm#fn_253.md) will
shine:  
Be that the day, with prosperous fate,  
The nuptial rites to celebrate.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_249"></span>[82:1](ry070.htm#fr_249.md) This is another
fanciful derivation, *Sa*--with, and *gara*--poison.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[82:2](ry070.htm#fr_250.md) *Purushádak* means a
cannibal. First called *Kalmáshapáda* on account of his spotted feet he
is said to have been turned into a cannibal for killing the son of
Vas'ishtha.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[82:1b](ry071.htm#fr_251.md) 'In the setting forth
of these royal genealogies the Bengal recension varies but slightly from
the Northern. The first six names of the genealogy of the Kings of
Ayodhyá are partly theogonical and partly cosmogonical; the other names
are no doubt in accordance with tradition and deserve the same amount of
credence as the ancient traditional genealogies of other nations.'
GORRESIO.
