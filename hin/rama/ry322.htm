<P>
But Hanum&aacute;nl onward pressed<BR>
With T&aacute;ra, Angad, and the rest,<BR>
Through Vindhya's pathless glens he sped<BR>
And left no spot unvisited.<BR>
He gazed from every mountain height,<BR>
He sought each cavern dark as night,<BR>
And wandered through the bloomy shade<BR>
By pool and river and cascade,<BR>
But, though they sought in every place,<BR>
Of Sit&aacute;they found no trace.<BR>
On fruit and woodland berries fed<BR>
Through many a lonely wild they sped,<BR>
And reached at last, untouched by fear,<BR>
A desert terrible and drear:<BR>
A fruitless waste, a land of gloom<BR>
Where trees were bare of leaf and bloom<BR>
Where every scanty stream was dried,<BR>
And niggard earth her roots denied.<BR>
No elephants through all the ground,<BR>
No buffaloes or deer are found.<BR>
There roams no tiger, pard, or bear,<BR>
No creature of the wood is there.<BR>
No bird displays his glittering wings,<BR>
No tree, no shrub, no creeper springs.<BR>
There rise no lilies from the flood,<BR>
Resplendent with their flower and bud,<BR>
Where the delighted bees may throng<BR>
About the fragrance with their song.<BR>
There lived a hermit Kandu named,<BR>
For truth and wealth of penance famed.<BR>
Whom fervent zeal and holy rite<BR>
Had dowered with all-surpassing might.<BR>
His little son, a ten year child--<BR>
So chanced it--perished in the wild.<BR>
His death with fury stirred the sage,<BR>
Who cursed the forest in his rage,<BR>
Doomed from that hour to shelter none,<BR>
A waste for bird and beast to shun.<BR>

They searched by every forest edge,<BR>
They searched each cave and mountain ledge,<BR>
And thickets whence the water fell<BR>
Wandering through the tangled dell.<BR>
Striving to do Sugr&iacute;va's<BR>
They roamed along each leafy rill.<BR>
But vain were all endeavours, vain<BR>
The careful search, the toil and pain.<BR>
Through one dark grove they scarce could wind,<BR>
So thick were creepers intertwined.<BR>
There as they struggled through the wood<BR>
Before their eyes an Asur &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_752"></A><A HREF="ry323.htm#fn_752"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> stood.<BR>
High as a towering hill, his pride<BR>
The very Gods in heaven defied.<BR>
When on the fiend their glances fell<BR>
Each braced him for the combat well.<BR>
The demon raised his arm on high,<BR>
And rushed upon them with a cry.<BR>
Him Angad smote,--for, sure, he thought<BR>
This was the fiend they long had sought.<BR>
From his huge mouth by Angad felled,<BR>
The blood in rushing torrents welled,<BR>
As, like a mountain from his base<BR>
Uptorn, he dropped upon his face.<BR>
Thus fell the mighty fiend: and they<BR>
Through the thick wood pursued their way;<BR>
Then, weary with the toil, reclined<BR>
Where leafy boughs to shade them twined.<BR>
