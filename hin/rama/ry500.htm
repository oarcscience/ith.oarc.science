<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CXXIX.: THE MEETING WITH BHARAT.</H3>
<P>
O'erwhelmed with rapture Bharat heard<BR>
The tale that all his being stirred,<BR>
And, heralding the glad event,<BR>
This order to Satrughna sent:<BR>
'Let every shrine with flowers be gay<BR>
Let incense burn and music play.<BR>
Go forth, go forth to meet your king,<BR>
Let tabours sound and minstrels sing,<BR>
Let bards swell high the note of praise<BR>
Skilled in the lore of ancient days.<BR>
Call forth the royal matrons: call<BR>
Each noble from the council hall.<BR>
Send all we love and honour most,<BR>
Send Br&aacute;hmans and the warrior host,<BR>
A glorious company to bring<BR>
In triumph home our lord the king.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Great rapture filled S'atrughna's breast,<BR>
Obedient to his brother's hest.<BR>
'Send forth ten thousand men' he cried,<BR>
'Let brawny arms be stoutly plied,<BR>
And, smoothing all with skilful care,<BR>
The road for Kosal's king prepare.<BR>
Then o'er the earth let thousands throw<BR>
Fresh showers of water cool as snow,<BR>
And others strew with garlands gay<BR>
With loveliest blooms our monarch's way.<BR>
On tower and temple porch and gate<BR>
Let banners wave in royal state.<BR>
And be each roof and terrace lined<BR>
With blossoms loose and chaplets twined.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The nobles hasting forth fulfilled<BR>
His order as S'atrughna willed.<BR>
Sublime on elephants they rode<BR>
Whose gilded girths with jewels glowed.<BR>
Attended close by thousands more<BR>
Gay with the gear and flags they bore.<BR>
A thousand chiefs their steeds bestrode,<BR>
Their glittering cars a thousand showed.<BR>
And countless hosts in rich array<BR>
Pursued on foot their eager way.<BR>
Veiled from the air with silken screens<BR>
In litters rode the widowed queens.<BR>
Kausaly&aacute; first, acknowledged head<BR>
And sovereign of the household, led:<BR>
Sumitr&aacute; next, and after, dames<BR>
Of lower rank and humbler names.<BR>
Then compassed by a white-robed throng<BR>
Of Br&aacute;hmans, heralded with song,<BR>
With shouts of joy from countless throats,<BR>
And shells' and tambours' mingled notes,<BR>
And drums resounding long and loud,<BR>
Exulting Bharat joined the crowd.<BR>
Still on his head, well-trained in lore<BR>
Of duty, R&aacute;ma's shoes he bore.<BR>
The moon-white canopy was spread<BR>
With flowery twine engarlanded<BR>

<P>
And jewelled chouries, meet to hold<BR>
O'er R&aacute;ma's brow, shone bright with gold,<BR>
Though Nandigr&aacute;ma's town they neared,<BR>
Of R&aacute;ma yet no sign appeared.<BR>
Then Bharat called the V&aacute;nar chief<BR>
And questioned thus in doubt and grief:<BR>
'Hast thou uncertain, like thy kind,<BR>
A sweet delusive guile designed?<BR>
Where, where is royal R&aacute;ma? show<BR>
The hero, victor of the foe.<BR>
I gaze, but see no V&aacute;nars still<BR>
Who wear each varied shape at will.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In eager love thus Bharat cried,<BR>
And thus the Wind-God's son replied:<BR>
'Look, Bharat, on those laden trees<BR>
That murmur with the song of bees;<BR>
For R&aacute;ma's sake the saint has made<BR>
Untimely fruits, unwonted shade.<BR>
Such power in ages long ago<BR>
Could Indra's gracious boon bestow.<BR>
O, hear the V&aacute;nars' voices, hear<BR>
The shouting which proclaims them near<BR>
E'en now about to cross they seem<BR>
Sweet Gomati's delightful stream.<BR>
I see, I see the car designed<BR>
By Brahm&aacute;'s own creative mind,<BR>
The car which, radiant as the moon,<BR>
Moves at the will by Brahm&aacute;'s boon;<BR>
The car which once was R&aacute;van's pride,<BR>
The victor's spoil when R&aacute;van died.<BR>
Look, there are Raghu's sons: between<BR>
The brothers stands the rescued queen.<BR>
There is Vibh&iacute;shan full in view,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va and his retinue.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: then rapture loosed each tongue:<BR>
From men and dames, from old and young,<BR>
One long, one universal cry,<BR>
'Tis he,'tis R&aacute;ma, smote the sky.<BR>
All lighted down with eager speed<BR>
From elephant and car and steed,<BR>
And every joyful eye intent<BR>
On R&aacute;ma's moonbright face was bent.<BR>
Entranced a moment Bharat gazed:<BR>
Then reverential hands he raised,<BR>
And on his brother humbly pressed<BR>
The honours due to welcome guest.<BR>
Then Bharat clomb the car to greet<BR>
His king and bowed him at his feet,<BR>
Till R&aacute;ma raised him face to face<BR>
And held him in a close embrace.<BR>
Then Lakshman and the Maithil dame<BR>
He greeted as he spoke his name &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1049"></A><A HREF="#fn_1049"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
He greeted next, supreme in place,<BR>
The sovereign of the V&aacute;nar race,<BR>
And J&aacute;mbav&aacute;n and B&aacute;li's son,<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_506"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 506</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And lords and chiefs, omitting none.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1050"></A><A HREF="#fn_1050"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Sugr&iacute;va to his heart he pressed<BR>
And thus with grateful words addressed:<BR>
'Four brothers, V&aacute;nar king, were we,<BR>
And now we boast a fifth in thee.<BR>
By kindly acts a friend we know:<BR>
Offence and wrong proclaim the foe,'<BR>
To King Vibh&iacute;shan then he spake:<BR>
'Well hast thou fought fov R&aacute;ma's sake.'<BR>
Nor was the brave S'atrughna slow<BR>
His reverential love to show<BR>
To both his brothers, as was meet,<BR>
And venerate the lady's feet.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma to his mother came,<BR>
Saw her pale cheek and wasted frame,<BR>
With gentle words her heart consoled,<BR>
And clasped her feet with loving hold.<BR>
Then at Sumitra's feet he bent,<BR>
And fair Kaikeyi's, reverent,<BR>
Greeted each dame from chief to least,<BR>
And bowed him to the household priest.<BR>
Up rose a shout from all the throng:<BR>
'O welcome, R&aacute;ma, mourned so long.<BR>
Welcome, Kausaly&aacute;'s joy and pride,'<BR>
Ten hundred thousand voices cried.<BR>
Then Bharat placed, in duty taught,<BR>
On R&aacute;ma's feet the shoes he brought:<BR>
'My King,' he cried, 'receive again<BR>
The pledge preserved through years of pain,<BR>
The rule and lordship of the land<BR>
Entrusted to my weaker hand.<BR>
No more I sigh o'er sorrows past,<BR>
My birth and life are blest at last<BR>
In the glad sight this day has shown,<BR>
When R&aacute;ma comes to rule his own.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: the faithful love that moved<BR>
The prince's soul each heart approved;<BR>
Nor could the V&aacute;nar chiefs refrain<BR>
From tender tears that fell like rain.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma, stirred with joy anew,<BR>
His arms about his brother threw,<BR>
And to the grove his course he bent<BR>
Where Bharat's hermit days were spent.<BR>
Alighting in that pure retreat<BR>
He pressed the earth with eager feet.<BR>
Then, at his hest, the car rose high<BR>
And sailing through the northern sky<BR>
Sped homeward to the Lord of Gold<BR>
Who owned the wondrous prize of old. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1051"></A><A HREF="#fn_1051"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>

And the chariot returned unto R&aacute;ma:'
and he honoured it when he had heard
what had passed.</P>
