### CANTO LXXIX.: BHARAT'S COMMANDS.

Now when the sun's returning ray  
Had ushered in the fourteenth day,  
The gathered peers of state addressed  
To Bharat's ear their new request:  
'Our lord to heaven has parted hence,  
Long served with deepest reverence;  
Ráma, the eldest, far from home,  
And Lakshman, in the forest roam.  
O Prince, of mighty fame, be thou  
Our guardian and our monarch now,  
Lest secret plot or foeman's hate  
Assail our unprotected state  
With longing eyes, O Lord of men,  
To thee look friend and citizen,  
And ready is each sacred thing  
To consecrate our chosen king.  
Come, Bharat, and accept thine own  
Ancient hereditary throne.  
Thee let the priests this day install  
As monarch to preserve us all.'  
  Around the sacred gear he bent  
His circling footsteps reverent,  
And, firm to vows he would not break,  
Thus to the gathered people spake:  
'The eldest son is ever king:  
So rules the house from which we spring:  
Nor should ye, Lords, like men unwise,  
With words like these to wrong advise.  
Ráma is eldest born, and he  
The ruler of the land shall be.  
Now to the woods will I repair,  
Five years and nine to lodge me there.  
Assemble straight a mighty force,  
Cars, elephants, and foot and horse,  
For I will follow on his track  
And bring my eldest brother back.  
Whate'er the rites of throning need  
Placed on a car the way shall lead:  
The sacred vessels I will take  
To the wild wood for Ráma's sake,  
I o'er the lion prince's head  
The sanctifying balm will shed,  
And bring him, as the fire they bring  
Forth from the shrine, with triumphing.  
Nor will I let my mother's greed  
In this her cherished aim succeed:  
In pathless wilds will I remain,  
And Ráma here as king shall reign.  
To make the rough ways smooth and clear  
Send workman out and pioneer:  
Let skilful men attend beside  
Our way through pathless spots to guide.'  
As thus the royal Bharat spake,  
Ordaining all for Ráma's sake,  
The audience gave with one accord  
Auspicious answer to their lord:  
'Be royal Fortune aye benign  
To thee for this good speech of thine,  
Who wishest still thine elder's hand  
To rule with kingly sway the land.'  
  Their glorious speech, their favouring cries  
    Made his proud bosom swell:  
  And from the prince's noble eyes  
    The tears of rapture fell.  <span
