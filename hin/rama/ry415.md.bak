### CANTO XVI.: RÁVAN'S SPEECH.

Then, while his breast with fury swelled,  
Thus Rávan spoke, as fate impelled:  
   'Better with foes thy dwelling make,  
Or house thee with the venomed snake,  
Than live with false familiar friends  
Who further still thy foeman's ends.  
I know their treacherous mood, I know  
Their secret triumph at thy woe.  
They in their inward hearts despise  
The brave, the noble, and the wise,  
Grieve at their bliss with rancorous hate,  
And for their sorrows watch and wait:  
Scan every fault with curious eye,  
And each slight error magnify.  
Ask elephants who roam the wild  
How were their captive friends beguiled.  
'For fire,' they cry, 'we little care,  
For javelin and shaft and snare:  
Our foes are traitors, taught to bind  
The trusting creatures of their kind.'  
Still, still, shall blessings flow from cows, <span
id="fr_936"></span>[1](#fn_936.md)  
And Brahmans love their rigorous vows;  
Still woman change her restless will,  
And friends perfidious work us ill,  
What though with conquering feet I tread  
On every prostrate foeman's head;  
What though the worlds in abject fear  
Their mighty lord in me revere  
This thought my peace of mind destroys  
And robs me of expected joys.  
The lotus of the lake receives  
The glittering rain that gems its leaves,  
But each bright drop remains apart:  
So is it still with heart and heart,  
Deceitful as an autumn cloud  
Which, though its thunderous voice be loud,  
On the dry earth no torrent sends,  
Such is the race of faithless friends,  
No riches of the bloomy spray  
Will tempt the wandering bee to stay  
That loves from flower to flower to range;  
And friends like thee are swift to change,  
Thou blot upon thy glorious line,  
If any giant's tongue but thine  
Had dared to give this base advice,  
He should not live to shame me twice,'  
   Then just Vibhíshan in the heat  
Of anger started from his seat,  
And with four captains of the band  
Sprang forward with his mace in hand;  
Then, fury flashing from his eye,  
Looked on the king and made reply:  

   'Thy rights, O Rávan, I allow:  
My brother and mine elder thou.  
Such, though from duty's path they stray,  
We love like fathers and obey,  
But still too bitter to be borne  
Is thy harsh speech of cruel scorn.  
The rash like thee, who spurn control,  
Nor check one longing of the soul,  
Urged by malignant fate repel  
The faithful friend who counsels well,  
A thousand courtiers wilt thou meet,  
With flattering lips of smooth deceit;  
But rare are they whose tongue or ear  
Will speak the bitter truth, or hear.  
Unclose thy blinded eyes and see  
That snares of death encompass thee,  
I dread, my brother, to behold  
The shafts of Ráma, bright with gold,  
Flash fury through the air, and red  
With fires of vengeance strike thee dead,  
Lord, brother, King, again reflect,  
Nor this mine earnest prayer reject,  
O, save thyself, thy royal town,  
Thy people and thine old renown."
