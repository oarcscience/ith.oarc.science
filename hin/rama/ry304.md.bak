### CANTO XXX.: RÁMA'S LAMENT.

But Ráma in the autumn night  
Stood musing on the mountain height.  
While grief and love that scorned control  
Shook with wild storms the hero's soul.  
Clear was the sky, without a cloud  
The glory of the moon to shroud.  
And bright with purest silver shone  
Each hill the soft beams looked upon,  
He knew Sugriva's heart was bent  
On pleasure, gay and negligent.  
He thought on Janak's child forlorn  
From his fond arms for ever torn.  
He mourned occasion slipping by,  
And faint with anguish heaved each sigh  

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>  

He sat where many a varied streak  
Of rich ore marked the mountain peak.  
He raised his eyes the skv to view.  
And to his love his sad thoughts flew.  
He. heard the Sáras cry, and faint  
With sorrow poured his love-born plaint:  
She, she who mocked the softest tone  
Of wild birds' voices with her own,--  
Where strays she now, my love who played  
So happy in our hermit shade '  
How can my absent love behold  
The bright trees with their flowers of gold,  
And a11 their gleaming glory see  
With eyes that vainly look for me?  
How is it with my darling when  
From the deep tangles of the glen  
Float carols of each bird elate  
With rapture singing to his mate?  
In vain my weary glances rove  
From lake to hill, from stream to grove:  
I find no rapture in the scene,  
And languish fur my fawn-eyed queen.  
Ah, does strong love with wild unrest,  
Born no the autumn, stir her breast?  
And does the gentle lady pine  
Till her bright eyes shall look in mine?'  
   Thus Raghu's son in piteous tone,  
O'erwhelmed with sorrow, made his moan.  
E'en as the bird that drinks the rains  <span
id="fr_633"></span>[1](#fn_633.md)  
To Indra thousand-eyed complains.  
Then Lakshman who had wandered through  
The copses where the berries grew,  
Returning to the cavern found  
His brother chief\* in sorrow drowned,  
And pitying the woes that broke  
The spirit, of the hero spoke:  
   'Why east thy strength of soul away,  
And weakly yield to passion's sway?  
Arise, my brother, do and dare  
Ere action perish in despair.  
Refill the firmness of thy heart,  
And nerve thee for a hero's part.  
Whose is the hand unscathed to sieze  
The red flame quickened by the breeze?  
Where is the foe will dare to wrong  
Or keep the Maithil lady long?'  
Then with pale lips that sorrow dried  
The son of Raghu thus replied:  
Lord Indra thousand-eyed, has sent  
The sweet rain from the firmament,  
Sees the rich promise of the grain,  
And turns him to his rest again.  
The clouds with voices loud and deep,  
Veiling each tree upon the steep,  
Up on the thirsty earth have shed  
Their precious burden and are fled.  

Now in kings' hearts ambition glows:  
They rush to battle with their foes; <span
id="fr_634"></span>[1b](#fn_634.md)  
But in Sugríva's sloth I see  
No care for deeds of chivalry.  
See, Lakshman, on each breezy height  
A thousand autumn blooms are bright.  
See how the wings of wild swans gleam  
On every islet of the stream.  
Four months of flood and rain are past:  
A hundred years they seemed to last  
To me whom toil and trouble tried,  
My Sitá severed from my side.  
She, gentlest woman, weak and young,  
Still to her lord unwearied clung.  
Still by the exile's side she stood  
In the wild ways of Dandak wood,  
Like a fond bird disconsolate  
If parted from her darling mate.  
Sugríva, lapped in soft repose.  
Untouched by pity for my woes,  
Scorns the poor exile, dispossessed,  
By Rávan's mightier arm oppressed,  
The wretch who comes to sue and pray  
From his lost kingdom far away.  
Hence falls on me the Vánar's scorn,  
A suitor friendless and forlorn.  
The time is come: with heedless eye  
He sees the hour of action fly,--  
Unmindful, now his hopes succeed,  
Of promise made in stress of need.  
Go seek him sunk in bliss and sloth,  
Forgetful of his royal oath,  
And as mine envoy thus upbraid  
The monarch for his help delayed:  
'Vile is the wretch who will not pay  
The favour of an earlier day,  
Hope in the supplicant's breast awakes,  
And then his plighted promise breaks.  
Noblest, mid all of women born,  
Who keeps the words his lips have sworn.  
Yea, if those words be good or ill.  
Maintains his faith unbroken still.  
The \*ss who forget to aid  
The friend who helped them when they prayed,  
Dishonoured in their death shall lie,  
And dogs shall pass their corpses by.  
Sure thou wouldst see my strained arm hold  
My bow of battle backed with gold,  
Wouldst gaze upon its awful from  
Like lightning flashing through the storm,  
And hear the clanging bowstring loud  
As thunder from a labouring cloud  
   His valour and his strength I know:  
But pleasure's sway now sinks them low  
With thee, my brother, for ally  
That strength and valour I defy  

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>  

He promised, when the rains should end,  
The succour of his arm to lend.  
Those months are past: he dares forget.  
And, lapped in pleasure, slumbers yet.  
No thought disturbs his careless breast  
For us impatient and distressed.  
And, while we sadly wait and pine,  
Girt by his lords he quaffs the wine.  
Go, brother, go, his palace seek,  
And boldly to Sugríva speak.  
Thus give the listless king to know  
What waits him if my anger glow:  
Still open, to the gloomy God,  
Lies the sad path that Báli trod.  
'Still to thy plighted word be true,  
Lest thou, O King, that path pursue.  
I launched the shaft I pointed well.  
And Báli, only Báli, fell.  
But, if from truth thou dare to stray,  
Both thee and thine this hand shall slay.'  
Thus be the Vánar king addressed,  
Then add thyself what seems the best.
