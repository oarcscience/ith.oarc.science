### CANTO LXIII.: SAMPÁTI'S STORY.

'With this and many a speech beside.  
My failing heart he fortified,  

With glorious hope my breast inspired,  
And to his holy home retired.  
I scaled the mountain height, to view  
The region round, and looked for you.  
In ceaseless watchings night and day  
A hundred seasons passed away,  
And by the sage's words consoled  
I wait the hour and chance foretold.  
But since Nis'ákar sought the skies.  
And cast away all earthly ties,  
Full many a care and doubt has pressed  
With grievous weight upon my breast.  
But for the saint who turned aside  
My purpose I had surely died.  
Those hopeful words the hermit spake,  
That bid me live for Ráma's sake,  
Dispel my anguish as the light  
Of lamp and torch disperse the night.'  
   He ceased: and in the Vánars' view  
Forth from his side young pinions grew,  
And boundless rapture filled his breast  
As thus the chieftains he addressed:  
'Joy, joy! the pinions, which the Lord  
Of Day consumed, are now restored  
Through the dear grace & boundless might  
Of that illustrious anchorite.  
The tire of youth within me burns,  
And all my wonted strength returns.  
Onward, ye Vánars, toil strive,  
And you shall find the dame alive.  
Look on these new-found wings, and hence  
Be strong in surest confidence.'  
   Swift from the crag he sprang to try  
His pinions in his nativie sky.  
His words the chieftains' doubts had stilled?  
And every heart with courage filled. <span
