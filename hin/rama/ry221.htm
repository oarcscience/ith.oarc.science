<P>
As forth upon its errand went<BR>
That huge ferocious armament,<BR>
An awful cloud, in dust and gloom,<BR>
With threatening thunders from its womb<BR>
Poured in sad augury a flood<BR>
Of rushing water mixt with blood.<BR>
The monarch's steeds, though strong and fleet,<BR>
Stumbled and fell: and yet their feet<BR>
Passed o'er the bed of flowers that lay<BR>
Fresh gathered on the royal way.<BR>
No gleam of sunlight struggled through<BR>
The sombre pall of midnight hue,<BR>
Edged with a line of bloody red,<BR>
Like whirling torches overhead.<BR>
A vulture, fierce, of mighty size.<BR>
Terrific with his cruel eyes,<BR>
Perched on the staff enriched with pold,<BR>
Whence hung the flag in many a fold<BR>
Each ravening bird, each beast of prey<BR>
Where Janasth&aacute;n's wild thickets lay,<BR>
Rose with a long discordant cry<BR>
And gathered as the host went by,<BR>
And from the south long, wild, and shrill,<BR>
Came spirit voices boding ill.<BR>
Like elephants in frantic mood,<BR>
Vast clouds terrific, sable-hued,<BR>
Hid all the sky where'er they bore<BR>
Their load of water mixt with gore.<BR>
Above, below, around were spread<BR>
Thick shades of darkness strange and dread,<BR>
Nor could the wildered glance descry<BR>
A point or quarter of the sky.<BR>
Then came o'er heaven a sanguine hue,<BR>
Though evening's flush not yet was due,<BR>
While each ill-omened bird that flies<BR>
Assailed the king with harshest cries.<BR>
There screamed the vulture and the crane,<BR>
And the loud jackal shrieked again.<BR>
Each hideous thing that bodes aright<BR>
Disaster in the coming fight,<BR>
With gaping mouth that hissed and flamed,<BR>
The ruin of the host proclaimed.<BR>
Eclipse untimely reft away<BR>
The brightness of the Lord of Day,<BR>
And near his side was seen to glow<BR>
A mace-like comet boding woe.<BR>
Then while the sun was lost to view<BR>
A mighty wind arose and blew,<BR>
And stars like fireflies shed their light,<BR>
Nor waited for the distant night.<BR>
The lilies drooped, the brooks were dried,<BR>
The fish and birds that swam them died,<BR>
And every tree that was so fair<BR>
With flower and fruit was stripped and bare.<BR>
The wild wind ceased, yet, raised on high,<BR>
Dark clouds of dust involved the sky.<BR>
In doleful twitter long sustained<BR>
The restless S&aacute;rik&aacute;s &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_462"></A><A HREF="#fn_462"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> complained,<BR>
And from the heavens with flash and flame<BR>
Terrific meteors roaring came.<BR>
Earth to her deep foundation shook<BR>
With rock and tree and plain and brook,<BR>
As Khara with triumphant shout,<BR>
Borne in his chariot, sallied out.<BR>
His left arm throbbed: he knew full well<BR>
That omen, and his visage fell.<BR>
Each awful sign the giant viewed,<BR>
And sudden tears his eye bedewed.<BR>
Care on his brow sat chill and black,<BR>
Yet mad with wrath he turned not back.<BR>
Upon each fearful sight that raised<BR>
The shuddering hair the chieftain gazed,<BR>
And laughing in his senseless pride<BR>
Thus to his giant legions cried:<BR>
'By sense of mightiest strength upborne,<BR>
These feeble signs I laugh to scorn.<BR>
I could bring down the stars that shine<BR>
In heaven with these keen shafts of mine.<BR>
Impelled by warlike fury I<BR>
Could cause e'en Death himself to die.<BR>

<P>
I will not seek my home again<BR>
Until my pointed shafts have slain<BR>
This Raghu's son so fierce in pride,<BR>
And Lakshman by his brother's side.<BR>
And she, my sister, she for whom<BR>
These sons of Raghu meet their doom,<BR>
She with delighted lips shall drain.<BR>
The lifeblood of her foemen slain.<BR>
Fear not for me: I ne'er have known<BR>
Defeat, in battle overthrown.<BR>
Fear not for me, O giants; true<BR>
Are the proud words I speak to you.<BR>
The king of Gods who rules on high,<BR>
If wild Air'avat bore him nigh,<BR>
Should fall before me bolt in hand:<BR>
And shall these two my wrath withstand!'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ended and the giant host<BR>
Who heard their chief's triumphant boast,<BR>
Rejoiced with equal pride elate,<BR>
Entangled in the noose of Fate.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then met on high in bright array,<BR>
With eyes that longed to see the fray,<BR>
God and Gandharva, sage and saint,<BR>
With beings pure from earthly taint.<BR>
Blest for good works aforetime wrought,<BR>
Thus each to other spake his thought:<BR>
'Now joy to Br'ahmans, joy to kine,<BR>
And all whom world count half divine!<BR>
May Raghu's offspring slay in fight<BR>
Pulastya's sons who roam by night!'<BR>
In words like these and more, the best<BR>
Of high-souled saints their hopes expressed,<BR>
Bending their eager eyes from where<BR>
Car-borne with Gods they rode in air.<BR>
Beneath them stretching far, they viewed<BR>
The giants' death-doomed multitude.<BR>
They saw where, urged with fury, far<BR>
Before the host rolled Khara's car,<BR>
And close beside their leader came<BR>
Twelve giant peers of might and fame.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_463"></A><A HREF="#fn_463"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Four other chiefs &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_464"></A><A HREF="#fn_464"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> before the rest<BR>
Behind their leader D'ushan pressed.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Impetuous, cruel, dark, and dread,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    All thirsting for the fray,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hosts of giant warriors sped<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Onward upon their way.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With eager speed they reached the spot<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Where dwelt the princely two,--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like planets in a league to blot<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The sun and moon from view.<BR>
