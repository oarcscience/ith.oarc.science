### CANTO XLIX.: RÁMA'S LAMENT

Ranged round the spot where Ráma fell  
Each Vánar chief stood sentinel.  
At length the mighty hero broke  
The trance that held him, and awoke.  
He saw his senseless brother, dyed  
With blood from head to foot, and cried:  
'What have I now to do with life  
Or rescue of my prisoned wife,  
When thus before my weeping eyes,  
Slain in the fight, my brother lies?  
A queen like Sítá I may find  
Among the best of womankind,  
But never such a brother, tried  
In war, my guardian, friend, and guide.  
If he be dead, the brave and true,  
I will not live but perish too.  
How, reft of Lakshman, shall I meet  
My mother, and Kaikeyí greet?  
Mv brother's eager question brook,  
And fond Sumitrá's longing look?  
What shall I say, o'erwhelmed with shame  
To cheer the miserable dame?  
How, when she hears her son is dead,  
Will her sad heart be comforted?  
Ah me, for longer life unfit  
This mortal body will I quit;  
For Lakshman slaughtered for my sake,  
From sleep of death will never wake.  
Ah when I sank oppressed with care,  
Thy gentle voice could soothe despair.  
And art thou, O my brother, killed?  
Is that dear voice for ever stilled?  
Cold are those lips, my brother, whence  
Came never word to breed offence?  
Ah stretched upon the gory plain  
My brother lies untimely slain;  
Numbed is the mighty arm that slew  
The leaders of the giant crew.  
Transfixed with shafts, with blood-streams red.  
Thou liest on thy lowly bed:  

<span id="page_464">p. 464</span>  

So sinks to rest, his journey done,  
Mid arrowy rays the crimson sun.  
Thou, when from home and sire I fled,  
The wood's wild ways with me wouldst tread:  
Now close to thine my steps shall be,  
For I in death will follow thee.  
Vibhíshan now will curse my name,  
And Ráma as a braggart blame.  
Who promised--but his word is vain--  
That he in Lanká's isle should reign.  
Return, Sugríva: reft of me  
Lead back thy Vánars o'er the sea,  
Nor hope to battle face to face  
With him who rules the giant race.  
Well have ye done and nobly fought,  
And death in desperate combat sought.  
All that heroic might can do,  
Brave Vánars, has been done by you.  
My faithful friends I now dismiss:  
Return: my last farewell is this.'  

Bedewed with tears was every cheek  
As thus the Vánars heard him speak.  
Vibhíshan on the field had stayed  
The Vánar hosts who fled dismayed.  
Now lifting up his mace on high  
With martial step the chief drew nigh.  
The hosts who watched by Ráma's side  
Beheld his shape and giant stride.  
'Tis he,'tis Rávan's son, they thought:  
And all in flight their safety sought.
