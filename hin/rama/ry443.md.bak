### CANTO XLIV.: THE NIGHT.

The lord of Light had sunk and set:  
Night came; the foeman struggled yet;  
And fiercer for the gloom of night  
Grew the wild fury of the fight.  
Scarce could each warrior's eager eye  
The foeman from the friend descry.  
'Rákshas or Vánar? say;' cried each,  
And foe knew foeman by his speech.  
'Why wilt thou fly? O warrior, stay:  
'Turn on the foe, and rend and slay:'  
Such were the cries, such words of fear  
Smote through the gloom each listening ear.  
Each swarthy rover of the night  
Whose golden armour flashed with light,  
Showed like a towering hill embraced  
By burning woods about his waist.  
The giants at the Vánars flew,  
And ravening ate the foes they slew:  
With mortal bite like serpent's fang,  
The Vánars at the giants sprang,  
And car and steeds and they who bore  
The pennons fell bedewed with gore,  
No serried band, no firm array  
The fury of their charge could stay  
Down went the horse and rider, down  
Went giant lords of high renown.  
Though midnight's shade was dense and dark,  
With skill that swerved not from the mark  

Their bows the sons of Raghu drew,  
And each keen shaft a chieftain slew.  
Uprose the blinding dust from meads  
Ploughed by the cars and trampling steeds,  
And where the warriors fell the flood  
Was dark and terrible with blood.  
Six giants  <span id="fr_962"></span>[1b](ry444.htm#fn_962.md) singled Ráma
out,  
And charged him with a furious shout  
Loud as the roaring of the sea  
When every wind is raging free.  
Six times he shot: six heads were cleft;  
Six giants dead on earth were left.  
Nor ceased he yet: his bow he strained,  
And from the sounding weapon rained  
A storm of shafts whose fiery glare  
Filled all the region of the air;  
And chieftains dropped before his aim  
Like moths that perish in the flame.  
Earth glistened where the arrows fell,  
As shines in autumn nights a dell  
Which fireflies, flashing through the gloom,  
With momentary light illume.  

But Indrajit, when Báli's son  <span
id="fr_963"></span>[2b](ry444.htm#fn_963.md)  
The victory o'er the foe had won.  
Saw with a fury-kindled eye  
His mangled steeds and driver die;  
Then, lost in air, he fled the fight,  
And vanished from the victor's sight.  
The Gods and saints glad voices raised,  
And Angad for his virtue praised;  
And Raghu's sons bestowed the meed  
Of honour due to valorous deed.  

Compelled his shattered car to quit,  
Rage filled the soul of Indrajit,  
Who brooked not, strong by Brahmá's grace  
Defeat from one of Vánar race.  
In magic mist concealed from view  
His bow the treacherous warrior drew,  
And Raghu's sons were first to feel  
The tempest of his winged steel.  
Then when his arrows failed to kill  
The princes who defied him still,  
He bound them with the serpent noose,  <span
id="fr_964"></span>[3b](ry444.htm#fn_964.md)  
The magic bond which none might loose.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_961"></span>[460:1](ry442.htm#fr_961.md) I have omitted
several of these single combats, as there is little variety in the
details and each duel results in the victory of the Vánar or his ally.
