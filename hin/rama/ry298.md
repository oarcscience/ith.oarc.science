### CANTO XXIV.: SUGRÍVA'S LAMENT.

But when Sugríva saw her weep  
O'erwhelmed in sorrow's rushing deep.  
Swift through his bosom pierced the sting  
Of anguish for the fallen king.  
At the sad sight his eyes beheld  
A flood of bitter tears outwelled,  
And, with his bosom racked and rent,  
To Ráma with his train he went.  
He came with faltering steps and slow  
Where Ráma held his mighty bow  
And arrow like a venomed snake,  
And to the son of Raghu spake:  
'Well hast thou kept, O King, thy vow:  
The promised fruit is gathered now.  
But life is marred, my soul to-day  
Turns sickening from all joy away.  

For, while this queen laments and sighs  
Amid a mourning people's cries,  
And Angad weeps his father slain,  
How can my heart delight to reign?  
For outrage, fury, senseless pride,  
My brother, doomed of yore, has died.  
Yet, Raghu's son, in bitter woe  
I mourn his fated overthrow.  
Ah, better far in pain and ill  
To dwell on Rishyamúka still  
Than gain the heaven of Gods and all  
Its pleasures by my brother's fall.  
Did not he cry,--great-hearted foe,--  
'Go, for I will not slay thee, Go'?  
With his brave soul those words agree:  
My speech, my deeds, are worthy me.  
How can a brother counterweigh  
His grievous loss with joys of sway,  
And see with dull unpitying eye  
So brave and good a brother die?  
His lofty soul was nobly blind:  
My death alas, he ne'er designed;  
But I, urged blindly on by hate,  
Sought with his life my rage to sate.  
He smote me with a splintered tree:  
I groaned aloud and turned to flee,  
From stern reproaches he forbore,  
And gently bade me sin no more.  
Serene and dutiful and good  
He kept the laws of brotherhood:  
I, fierce and greedy, vengeful, base,  
Showed all the vices of our race.  
Ah me, dear friend, my brother's fate  
Lays on my soul a crushing weight:  
A sin no heart should e'er conceive,  
But at the thought each soul should grieve:  
Sin such as Indra's when his blow  
Laid heavenly Vis'varúpa  <span id="fr_611"></span>[1b](#fn_611.md) low.  
Yet earth, the waters of the seas,  
The race of women and the trees  
Were fain upon themselves to take  
The weight of sin for Indra's sake.  
But who a Vánar's soul will free,  
Or ease the load that crushes me?  
Wretch that I am, I may not claim  
The reverence due to royal name.  
How shall I reign supreme, or dare  
Affect the power I should not share?  
Ah me, I sorrow for my sin,  
The ruin of my race and kin,  
Polluted by a hideous crime  
World-hated till the end of time.  
Alas, the floods of sorrow roll  
With whelming force upon my soul:  
So gathers the descending rain  
In the deep hollow of the plain.
