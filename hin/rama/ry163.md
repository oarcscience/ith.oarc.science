### CANTO LXXXV.: GUHA AND BHARAT.

Thus tho Nishadas' king besought:  
The prince with spirit wisdom-fraught  

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>  

Replied in seemly words that blent  
Deep matter with the argument:  
'Thou, friend of him whom I revere,  
With honours high hast met me here,  
For thou alone wouldst entertain  
Aud feed to-day so vast a train."  
In such fair words the prince replied,  
Then, pointing to the path he cried:  
'Which way aright will lead my feet  
To Bharadvája's calm retreat;  
For all this land near Gangá's streams  
Pathless and hard to traverse seems?'  
   Thus spoke the prince: King Guha heard  
Delighted every prudent word,  
And gazing on that forest wide,  
Raised suppliant hands, and thus replied:  
'My servants, all the ground who know,  
O glorious Prince, with thee shall go  
With constant care thy way to guide,  
And I will journey by thy side.  
But this thy host so wide dispread  
Wakes in my heart one doubt and dread,  
Lest, threatening Ráma good and great,  
Ill thoughts thy journey stimulate."  
   But wheu King Guha, ill at ease,  
Declared his fear in words like these,  
As pure as is the cloudless sky  
With soft voice Bharat made reply:  
'Suspect me not: ne'er come the time  
For me to plot so foul a crime!  
He is my eldest brother, he  
Is like a father dear to me.  
I go to lead my brother thence  
Who makes the wood his residence.  
No thought but this thy heart should frame:  
This simple truth my lips proclaim.'  
   Then with glad cheer King Guha cried,  
With Bharat's answer gratified:  
'Blessed art thou: on earth I see  
None who may vie, O Prince, with thee,  
Who canst of thy free will resign  
The kingdom which unsought is thine.  
For this, a name that ne'er shall die,  
Thy glory through the worlds shall fly,  
Who fain wouldst balm thy brother's pain  
And lead the exile home again.'  
   As Guha thus, and Bharat, each  
To other spoke in friendly speech,  
The Day God sank with glory dead,  
And night o'er all the sky was spread.  
Soon as King Guha's thoughtful care  
Had quartered all the armv there,  
Well honoured, Bharat laid his head  
Beside S'atrughna on a bed.  
But grief for Ráma yet oppressed  
High-minded Bharat's faithful breast--  
Such torment little was deserved  
By him who ne'er from duty swerved.  
The fever raged through every vein  
And burnt him with its inward pain:  
So when in woods the flames leap free  

The fire within consumes the tree.  
From heat of burning anguish sprung  
The sweat upon his body hung,  
As when the sun with fervid glow  
On high Himalaya melts the snow.  
As, banished from the herd, a bull  
Wanders alone and sorrowful.  
   Thus sighing and distressed,  
In misery and bitter grief,  
With fevered heart that mocked relief,  
Distracted in his mind, the chief  
   Still mourned and found no rest.
