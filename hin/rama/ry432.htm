<P>
But Saram&aacute;, of gentler mood,<BR>
With pitying eyes the mourner viewed,<BR>
Stole to her side and softly told<BR>
Glad tidings that her heart consoled.<BR>
Revealing with sweet voice and smile<BR>
The secret of the giant's guile.<BR>
She, one of those who night and day<BR>
Watching in turns by S&iacute;t&aacute; lay.<BR>
Though R&aacute;kshas born felt pity's touch,<BR>
And loved the hapless lady much.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'I heard,' she said, 'thy bitter cry,<BR>
Heard R&aacute;van's speech and thy reply,<BR>
For, hiding in the thicket near,<BR>
No word or tone escaped mine ear.<BR>
When R&aacute;van hastened forth I bent<BR>
My steps to follow as he went,<BR>
And learnt the secret cause that drove<BR>
The monarch from the As'oka grove.<BR>
Believe me, Queen, thou needst not weep<BR>
For R&aacute;ma slaughtered in his sleep.<BR>
Thy lion lord of men defies<BR>
By day attack, by night surprise.<BR>
Can even giants slay with ease<BR>
Vast hosts who fight with brandished tree,<BR>
For whom, with eye that never sleeps,<BR>
His constant watch thy R&aacute;ma keeps?<BR>

<P>
Lord of the mighty arm and chest,<BR>
Of earthly warriors first and best,<BR>
Whose fame through all the regions rings,<BR>
Proud scion of a hundred kings;<BR>
Who guards his life and loves to lend<BR>
His saving succour to a friend:<BR>
Whose bow no hand but his can strain,--<BR>
Thy lord, thy R&aacute;ma is not slain.<BR>
Obedient to his master's will,<BR>
A great magician, trained in ill.<BR>
With deftest art surpassing thought<BR>
That marvellous illusion wrought.<BR>
Let rising hope thy grief dispel:<BR>
Look up and smile, for all is well.<BR>
And gentle Lakshm&iacute;, Fortune's Queen,<BR>
Regards thee with a favouring mien.<BR>
Thy R&aacute;ma with his V&aacute;nar train<BR>
Has thrown a bridge athwart the main,<BR>
Has led his countless legions o'er,<BR>
And ranged them on this southern shore.<BR>
These eyes have seen the hero stand<BR>
Girt by his hosts on Lank&aacute;'s strand,<BR>
And breathless spies each moment bring<BR>
Fresh tidings to the giant king;<BR>
And every peer and lord of state<BR>
Is called to counsel and debate.'<BR>

<P>
She ceased: the sound, long loud and clear,<BR>
Of gathering armies smote her ear,<BR>
Where call of drum and shell rang out,<BR>
The tambour and the battle shout;<BR>
And, while the din the echoes woke,<BR>
Again to Janak's child she spoke:<BR>
'Hear, lady, hear the loud alarms<BR>
That call the R&aacute;kshas troops to arms,<BR>
From stable and from stall they lead<BR>
The elephant and neighing steed,<BR>
Brace harness on with deftest care,<BR>
And chariots for the fight prepare.<BR>
Swift o'er the trembling ground career<BR>
Mailed horsemen armed with axe and spear.<BR>
And here and there in road and street<BR>
The terrible battalions meet.<BR>
I hear the gathering near and far,<BR>
The snorting steed, the rattling car.<BR>
Bold chieftains, leaders of the brave,<BR>
Press densely on, like wave on wave,<BR>
And bright the evening sunbeams glance<BR>
On helm and shield, on sword and lance.<BR>
Hark, lady, to the ringing steel,<BR>
Hark to the rolling chariot wheel:<BR>
Hark to the mettled courser's neigh<BR>
And drums' loud thunder far away.<BR>
The Queen of Fortune holds thee dear,<BR>
For Lank&aacute;'s troops are struck with fear,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma with the lotus eyes,<BR>
Like Indra monarch of the skies,<BR>
With conquering arm will slay his foe<BR>
And free his lady from her woe.<BR>
Soon will his breast support thy head,<BR>
And tears of joy thine eyes will shed.<BR>
Soon by his mighty arm embraced<BR>
The long-lost rapture wilt thou taste,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma, meet for highest bliss,<BR>
Will gain his guerdon in thy kiss.'<BR>
