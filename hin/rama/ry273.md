### CANTO LXXV.: SAVARI

Thus counselled by their friendly guide  
On through the wood the princes hied  
Pursuing still the eastern road  
To Pampa which Kabandha showed,  
Where trees that on the mountains grew  
With fruit like honey charmed the view  
They rested weary for the night  
Upon a mountain's wooded height,  
Then onward with the dawn they hied  
And stood, on Pampa's western side.  
Where S'avan's fair home they viewed  
Deep in that shady solitude.  
The princes reached the holy ground  
Where noble trees stood thick around,  
And joying in the lovely view  
Near to the aged votress drew.  
To meet the sons of Raghu came,  
With hands upraised, the pious dame,  
And bending low with reverence meet  
Welcomed them both and pressed theif feet,  
Then water, as beseems, she gave,  
Their lips to cool, their feet to lave.  
To that pure saint who never broke  
One law of duty Ráma--spoke:  
   'I trust no cares invade thy peace,  
While holy works and zeal increase;  
That thou content with scanty food  
All touch of ire hast long subdued;  
That all thy vows are well maintained;  

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>  

While peace of mind is surely gained:  
That reverence of the saints who taught  
The faithful heart due fruit has brought.'  
   The aged votaress pure of taint,  
Revered by every perfect saint,  
Rose to her feet by Ráma's side  
And thus in gentle tones replied:  
'My penance' meed this day I see  
Complete, my lord, in meeting thee.  
This day the fruit of birth I gain,  
Nor have I served the saints in vain,  
I reap rich fruits of toil and vow,  
And heaven itself awaits me now,  
When I, O chief of men, have done  
Honour to thee the godlike one.  
I feel, great lord, thy gentle eye  
My earthly spirit purify,  
And I, brave tamer of thy foes,  
Shall through thy grace in bliss repose.  
Thy feet by Chitrakáta strayed  
When those great saints whom I obeyed,  
In dazzling chariots bright of hue,  
Hence to their heavenly mansions flew.  
As the high saints were borne away  
I heard their holy voices say:  
   'In this pure grove, O devotee,  
Prince Ráma soon will visit thee.  
When he and Lakshman seek this shade,  
Be to thy guests all honour paid.  
Him shalt thou see, and pass away  
To those blest worlds which ne'er decay.'  
To me, O mighty chief, the best  
Of lofty saints these words addressed.  
Laid up within my dwelling lie  
Fruits of each sort which woods supply,--  
Food culled for thee in endless store  
From every tree on Pampá's shore.'  
   Thus to her virtuous guest she sued  
And he, with heavenly lore endued,  
Words such as these in turn addressed  
To her with equal knowledge blest:  
'Danu himself the power has told  
Of thy great masters lofty-souled.  
Now if thou will, mine eyes would fain  
Assurance of their glories gain.'  
   She heard the prince his wish declare:  
Then rose she, and the royal pair  
Of brothers through the wood she led  
That round her holy dwelling spread.  
'Behold Matanga's wood' she cried,  
'A grove made famous far and wide,  
Dark as thick clouds and tilled with herds  
Of wandering deer, and joyous birds.  
In this pure spot each reverend sire  
With offerings fed the holy fire.  
See here the western altar stands  
Where daily with their trembling hands  
The aged saints, so long obeyed  
By me, their gifts of blossoms laid.  
The holy power, O Raghu's son,  
By their ascetic virtue won,  
Still keeps their well-loved altar bright.  
Filling the air with beams of light.  
And those seven neighbouring lakes behold  
Which, when the saints infirm and old,  
Worn out by fasts, no longer sought,  
Moved hither drawn by power of thought.  
Look, Ráma, where the devotees  
Hung their bark mantles on the trees.  
Fresh from the bath: those garments wet  
Through many a day are dripping yet.  
See, through those aged hermits' power  
The tender spray, this bright-hued flower  
With which the saints their worship paid,  
Fresh to this hour nor change nor fade.  
Here thou hast seen each lawn and dell,  
And heard the tale I had to tell:  
Permit thy servant, lord, I pray,  
To cast this mortal shell away,  
For I would dwell, this life resigned,  
With those great saints of lofty mind,  
Whom I within this holy shade  
With reverential care obeyed.'  
   When Ráma and his brother heard  
The pious prayer the dame preferred,  
Filled full of transport and amazed  
They marvelled as her words they praised.  
Then Ráma to the votaress said  
Whose holy vows were perfected  
   'Go, lady, where thou fain wouldst be,  
O thou who well hast honoured me.'  
   Her locks in hermit fashion tied,  
Clad in hark coat and black deer-hide,  
When Ráma gave consent, the dame  
Resigned her body to the flame.  
Then like the fire that burns and glows.  
To heaven the sainted lady rose,  
In all her heavenly garments dressed,  
Immortal wreaths on neck and breast,  
Bright with celestial gems she shone  
Most beautiful to look upon,  
And like the flame of lightning sent  
A glory through the firmament.  
That holy sphere the dame attained,  
By depth of contemplation gained,  
Where roam high saints with spirits pure  
In bliss that shall for aye endure.
