### CANTO XXIII.: THE OMENS.

Then Ráma, peerless in the skill  
That marks each sign of good and ill,  
Strained his dear brother to his breast,  
And thus with prudent words addressed:  
'Now, Lakshman, by the water's side  
In fruitful groves the host divide,  
That warriors of each woodland race  
May keep their own appointed place.  
Dire is the danger: loss of friends,  
Of Vánars and of bears, impends.  
Distained with dust the breezes blow,  
And earth is shaken from below.  
The tall hills rock from foot to crown,  
And stately trees come toppling down.  
In threatening shape, with voice of fear,  
The clouds like cannibals appear,  
And rain in fitful torrents, red  
With sanguinary drops, is shed.  
Long streaks of lurid light invest  
The evening skies from east to west.  
And from the sun at times a ball  
Of angry fire is seen to fall.  
From every glen and brake is heard  
The boding voice of beast and bird:  
From den and lair night-prowlers run  
And shriek against the falling sun.  
Up springs the moon, but hot and red  
Kills the sad night with woe and dread;  
No gentle lustre, but the gloom.  
That heralds universal doom.  
A cloud of dust and vapour mars  
The beauty of the evening stars,  
And wild and fearful is the sky  
As though the wreck of worlds were nigh.  
Around our heads in boding flight  
Wheel hawk and vulture, crow and kite;  
And every bird of happy note  
Shrieks terror from his altered throat.  
Sword, spear and shaft shall strew the plain  
Dyed red with torrents of the slain.  
To-day the Vánar troops shall close  
Around the city of our foes.'
