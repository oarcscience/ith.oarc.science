<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXVI.: R&Aacute;VAN'S REPLY.</H3>
<P>
But R&aacute;van's breast with fury swelled,<BR>
And thus he spake by Death impelled,<BR>
While, under brows in anger bent,<BR>
Fierce glances from his eyes were sent:<BR>
'The bitter words which thou, misled<BR>
By friendly thought, hast fondly said,<BR>
Which praise the foe and counsel fear,<BR>
Unheeded fall upon mine ear.<BR>
How canst thou deem a mighty foe<BR>
This R&aacute;ma who, in stress of woe,<BR>
Seeks, banished as his sire decreed,<BR>
Assistance from the V&aacute;nar breed?<BR>
Am I so feeble in thine eyes,<BR>
Though feared by dwellers of the skies,--<BR>
Whose might in many a battle shown<BR>
The glorious race of giants own?<BR>
Shall I for fear of him restore<BR>
The lady whom I hither bore,<BR>
Exceeding fair like Beauty's Queen &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_954"></A><A HREF="#fn_954"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Without her well-loved lotus seen?<BR>
Around the chief let Lakshman stand,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, and each V&aacute;nar band,<BR>
Soon, Malyav&aacute;n, thine eyes will see<BR>
This boasted R&aacute;ma slain by me.<BR>
I in the brunt of war defy<BR>
The mightiest warriors of the sky;<BR>
And if I stoop to combat men,<BR>
Shall I be weak and tremble then?<BR>
This mangled trunk the foe may rend,<BR>
But R&aacute;van ne'er can yield or bend,<BR>
And be it vice or virtue, I<BR>
This nature never will belie.<BR>
What marvel if he bridged the sea?<BR>
Why should this deed disquiet thee?<BR>
This, only this, I surely know,<BR>
Back with his life he shall not go.'<BR>

<P>
Thus in loud tones the king exclaimed,<BR>
And mute stood Malyav&aacute;n ashamed,<BR>
His reverend head he humbly bent,<BR>
And slowly to his mansion went.<BR>
But R&aacute;van stayed, and deep in care<BR>
Held counsel with his nobles there,<BR>
All entrance to secure and close,<BR>
And guard the city from their foes.<BR>
He bade the chief Prahasta wait<BR>
Commander at the eastern gate.<BR>
To fierce Mahodar, strong and brave,<BR>
To keep the southern gate, he gave,<BR>
Where Mah&aacute;p&aacute;rs'va's might should aid<BR>
The chieftain with his hosts arrayed.<BR>
To guard the west--no chief more fit--<BR>
He placed the warrior Indrajit,<BR>

<P>

<P>
His son, the giant's joy and boast,<BR>
Surrounded by a R&aacute;kshas host:<BR>
And mighty S&aacute;ran hastened forth<BR>
With Suka to protect the north. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_955"></A><A HREF="ry436.htm#fn_955"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
'I will myself,' the monarch cried,<BR>
'Be present on the northern side.'<BR>
These orders for the walls' defence<BR>
The tyrant gave, then parted thence,<BR>
And, by the hope of victory fired,<BR>
To chambers far within, retired.<BR>
