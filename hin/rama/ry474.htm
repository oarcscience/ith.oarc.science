<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO C.: RAVAN IN THE FIELD.</H3>
<P>
The plain with bleeding limbs was spread,<BR>
And heaps of dying and of dead.<BR>
His mighty bow still R&aacute;ma strained,<BR>
And shafts upon the giants rained.<BR>
Still Angad and Sugr&iacute;va, wrought<BR>
To fury, for the V&aacute;nars fought.<BR>
Crushed with huge rocks through chest and side<BR>
Mahodar, Mah&aacute;p&aacute;rs'va died,<BR>
And Vin&uacute;p&aacute;ksha stained with gore<BR>
Dropped on the plain to rise no more.<BR>
When R&aacute;van saw the three o'erthrown<BR>
He cried aloud in furious tone:<BR>
'Urge, urge the car, my charioteer.<BR>
The haughty V&aacute;nars' death is near.<BR>
This very day shall end our griefs<BR>
For leaguered town and slaughtered chiefs.<BR>
R&aacute;ma the tree whose lovely fruit<BR>
Is S&iacute;t&aacute;, shall this arm uproot,--<BR>
Whose branches with protecting shade<BR>
Are V&aacute;nar lords who lend him aid.'<BR>
Thus cried the king: the welkin rang<BR>
As forth the eager coursers sprang,<BR>
And earth beneath the chariot shook<BR>
With flowery grove and hill and brook.<BR>
Fast rained his shafts: where'er he sped<BR>
The conquered V&aacute;nars fell or fled,<BR>
On rolled the car in swift career<BR>
Till Raghu's noble sons were near.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma looked upon the foe<BR>
And strained and tried his sounding bow.<BR>
Till earth and all the region rang<BR>
Re-echoing to the awful clang.<BR>
His bow the younger chieftain bent.<BR>
And shaft on shaft at R&aacute;van sent.<BR>
He shot: but R&aacute;van little recked;<BR>
Each arrow with his own he checked,<BR>
And headless, baffled of its aim,<BR>
To earth the harmless missile came;<BR>
And Lakshman stayed his arm o'erpowered<BR>
By the thick darts the giant showered.<BR>
Fierce waxed the fight and fiercer yet,<BR>
For R&aacute;van now and R&aacute;ma met,<BR>
And each on other poured amain<BR>
The tempest of his arrowy rain.<BR>
While all the sky above was dark<BR>
With missles speeding to their mark<BR>
Like clouds, with flashing lightning twined<BR>
About them, hurried by the wind.<BR>
Not fiercer was the wondrous fight<BR>
When Vritra fell by Indra's might.<BR>
All arts off war each foeman knew,<BR>
And trained alike, his bowstring drew.<BR>
Red-eyed with fury Lank&aacute;'s king<BR>
Pressed his huge fingers on the string,<BR>
And fixed in R&aacute;ma's brows a flight<BR>
Of arrows winged with matchless flight.<BR>

<P>
Still Raghu's son endured, and bore<BR>
That crown of shafts though wounded sore.<BR>
O'er a dire dart a spell he spoke<BR>
With mystic power to aid the stroke.<BR>
In vain upon the foe it smote<BR>
Rebounding from the steelproof coat.<BR>
The giant armed his bow anew,<BR>
And wondrous weapons hissed and flew,<BR>
Terrific, deadly, swift of flight,<BR>
Beaked like the vulture and the kite,<BR>
Or bearing heads of fearful make,<BR>
Of lion, tiger, wolf and snake.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1016"></A><A HREF="ry475.htm#fn_1016"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Then R&aacute;ma, troubled by the storm<BR>
Of flying darts in every form<BR>
Shot by an arm that naught could tire,<BR>
Launched at the foe his dart of fire,<BR>
Which, sacred to the Lord of Flame,<BR>
Burnt and consumed where'er it came.<BR>
And many a blazing shaft beside<BR>
The hero to his string applied.<BR>
With fiery course of dazzling hue<BR>
Swift to the mark each missile flew,<BR>
Some flashing like a shooting star,<BR>
Some as the tongues of lightning are;<BR>
One like a brilliant plant, one<BR>
In splendour like the morning sun.<BR>
Where'er the shafts of R&aacute;ma burned<BR>
The giant's darts were foiled and turned.<BR>
Far into space his weapons fled,<BR>
But as they flew struck thousands dead.<BR>
