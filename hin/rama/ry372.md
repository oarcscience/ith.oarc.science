### CANTO XXXII.: SÍTÁ'S DOUBT.

Her eyes the Maithil lady raised  
And on the monkey speaker gazed.  
She looked, and trembling at the sight  
Wept bitter tears in wild affright.  
She shrank a while with fear distraught,  
Then, nerved again, the lady thought:  
'Is this a dream mine eyes have seen,  
This creature, by our laws unclean?  
O, may the Gods keep Ráma, still,  
And Lakshman, and my sire, from ill!  
It is no dream: I have not slept,  
But, trouble-worn, have watched and wept  
Afar from that dear lord of mine  
For whom in ceaseless woe I pine,  
No art may soothe my wild distress  
Or lull me to forgetfulness.  
I see but him: my lips can frame  
No syllable but Ráma's name.  
Each sight I see, each sound I hear,  
Brings Ráma to mine eye or ear,  
The wish was in my heart, and hence  
The sweet illusion mocked my sense.  
'Twas but a phantom of the mind,  
And yet the voice was soft and kind  
Be glory to the Eternal Sire,  <span id="fr_854"></span>[1](#fn_854)  
Be glory to the Lord of Fire,  
The mighty Teacher in the skies,  <span
id="fr_855"></span>[2](#fn_855)  
And Indra with his thousand eyes,  
And may they grant the truth to be  
E'en as the words that startled me.'
