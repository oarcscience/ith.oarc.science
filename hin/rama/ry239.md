### CANTO XLI.: MÁRÍCHA'S REPLY.

Against his judgment sorely pressed  
By his imperious lord's behest,  
Márícha threats of death defied  
And thus with bitter words replied:  
'Ah, who, my King, with sinful thought  
This wild and wicked counsel taught,  
By which destruction soon will fall  
On thee, thy sons, thy realm and all?  
Who is the guilty wretch who sees  
With envious eye thy blissful ease,  
And by this plan, so falsely shown,  
Death's gate for thee has open thrown!  
With souls impelled by mean degire  
Thy foes against thy life conspire.  
They urge thee to destruction's brink,  
And gladly would they see thee sink.  
Who with base thought to work thee woe  
This fatal road has dared to show,  
And, triumph in his wicked eye,  
Would see thee enter io and die!  
To all thy counsellors, untrue,  
The punishment of death is due,  
Who see thee tempt the dangerous way,  
Nor strain each nerve thy foot to stay.  
Wise lords, whose king, by passion led,  
The path of sin begins to tread,  
Restrain him while there yet is time:  
But thine,--they see nor heed the crime.  
These by their master's will obtain  
Mirit and fame and joy and gain.  
"Tis only by their master's grace  
That servaits hold their lofty place.  
But when tbc monarch stoops to sin  
They lose each joy they strive to win,  
And all the people people high and low  
Fall in the common overthrow.  

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>  

Merit and fame and honour spring,  
Best of the mighty, from the king.  
So all should strive with heart and will  
To keep the king from every ill.  
Pride, violence, and sullen hate  
Will ne'er maintain a monarch's state,  
And those who cruel deeds advise  
Must perish when their master dies,  
Like drivers with their cars o'erthrown  
In places rough with root and stone.  
The good whose holy lives were spent  
On duty's highest laws intent,  
With wives and children many a time  
Have perished for another's crime.  
Hapless are they whose sovereign lord,  
Opposed to all, by all abhorred,  
Is cruel-hearted, harsh, severe:  
Thus might a jackal tend the deer.  
Now all the giant race await,  
Destroyed by thee, a speedy fate,  
Ruled by a king so cruel-souled,  
Foolish in heart and uncontrolled.  
Think not I fear the sudden blow  
That threatens now to lay me low:  
I mourn the ruin that I see  
Impending o'er thy host and thee.  
Me first perchance will Ráma kill,  
But soon his hand thy blood will spill.  
I die, and if by Ráma slain  
And not by thee, I count it gain.  
Soon as the hero's face I see  
His angry eyes will murder me,  
And if on her thy hands thou lay  
Thy friends and thou are dead this day.  
If with my help thou still must dare  
The lady from her lord to tear,  
Farewell to all our days are o'er,  
Lanká and giants are no more.  
In vain, in vain, an earnest friend,  
     I warn thee, King, and pray.  
   Thou wilt not to my prayers attend,  
     Or heed the words I say  
   So men when life is fleeting fast  
     And death's sad hour is nigh,  
   Heedless and blinded to the last  
     Reject advice and die.'
