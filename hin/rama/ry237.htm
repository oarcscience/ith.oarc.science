<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXIX.: M&Aacute;R&Iacute;CHA'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
'I told thee of that dreadful day<BR>
When R&aacute;ma smote and spared to slay.<BR>
Now hear me, R&aacute;van, while I tell<BR>
What in the after time befell.<BR>
At length, restored to strength and pride,<BR>
I and two mighty fiends beside<BR>
Assumed the forms of deer and strayed<BR>
Through Dandak wood in lawn and glade,<BR>
I reared terrific horns: beneath<BR>
Were flaming tongue and pointed teeth.<BR>
I roamed where'er my fancy led,<BR>
And on the flesh of hermits fed,<BR>
In sacred haunt, by hallowed tree,<BR>
Where'er the ritual fires might be.<BR>
A fearful shape, I wandered through<BR>
The wood, and many a hermit slew.<BR>
With ruthless rage the saints I killed<BR>
Who in the grove their tasks fulfilled.<BR>
When smitten to the earth they sank,<BR>
Their flesh I ate, their blood I drank,<BR>
And with my cruel deeds dismayed<BR>
All dwellers in the forest shade,<BR>
Spoiling their rites in bitter hate,<BR>
With human blood inebriate.<BR>
Once in the wood I chanced to see<BR>
R&aacute;ma again, a devotee,<BR>
A hermit, fed on scanty fare,<BR>
Who made the good of all his care.<BR>
His noble wife was by his side,<BR>
And Lakshman in the battle tried.<BR>
In senseless pride I scorned the might<BR>
Of that illustrious anchorite,<BR>
And heedless of a hermit foe,<BR>
Recalled my earlier overthow.<BR>

<P>
I charged him in my rage and scorn<BR>
To slay him with my pointed horn,<BR>
In heedless haste, to fury wrought<BR>
As on my former wounds I thought.<BR>
Then from the mighty bow he drew<BR>
Three foe-destroying arrows flew,<BR>
Keen-pointed, leaping from the string:<BR>
Swift as the wind or feathered king.<BR>
Dire shafts, on flesh of foemen fed,<BR>
Like rushing thunderbolts they sped.<BR>
With knots well smoothed and barbs well bent,<BR>
Shot e'en as one, the arrows went.<BR>
But I who R&aacute;ma's might had felt,<BR>
And knew the blows the hero dealt,<BR>
Escaped by rapid flight. The two<BR>
Who lingered on the spot, he slew.<BR>
I fled from mortal danger, freed<BR>
From the dire shaft by timely speed.<BR>
Now to deep thought my days I give,<BR>
And as a humble hermit live.<BR>
In every shrub, in every tree<BR>
I view that noblest devotee.<BR>
In every knotted trunk I mark<BR>
His deerskin and his coat of bark,<BR>
And see the bow-armed R&aacute;ma stand<BR>
Like Yama with his noose in hand.<BR>
I tell thee R&aacute;van, in my fright<BR>
A thousand R&aacute;mas mock my sight,<BR>
This wood with every bush and bough<BR>
Seems all one fearful R&aacute;ma now.<BR>
Throughout the grove there is no spot<BR>
So lonely where I see him not.<BR>
He haunts me in my dreams by night,<BR>
And wakes me with the wild affright.<BR>
The letter that begins his name<BR>
Sends terror through my startled frame.<BR>
The rapid cars whereon we ride,<BR>
The rich rare jewels, once my pride,<BR>
Have names &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_494"></A><A HREF="#fn_494"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that strike upon mine ear<BR>
With hated sound that counsels fear.<BR>
His mighty strength too well I know,<BR>
Nor art thou match for such a foe.<BR>
Too strong were Raghus's son in fight<BR>
For Namu*chi or Bali's might.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma to the battle dare,<BR>
Or else be patient and forbear;<BR>
But, wouldst thou see me live in peace,<BR>
Let mention of the hero cease.<BR>
The good whose holy lives were spent<BR>
In deepest thought, most innocent.<BR>
With all their people many a time<BR>
Have perished through another's crime.<BR>
So in the common ruin, I<BR>
Must for another's folly die,<BR>
Do all thy strength and courage can.<BR>
But ne'er will I approve the plan.<BR>
For he, in might supremely great,<BR>

<P>

<P>
The giant world could extirpate,<BR>
Since, when impetuous Khara sought<BR>
The grove of Janasth&aacute;n and fought<BR>
For S&uacute;rpanakh&aacute;'s sake, he died<BR>
By R&aacute;ma's hand in battle tried.<BR>
How has he wronged thee? Soothly swear,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma's fault and sin declare.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  I warn thee, and my words are wise,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I seek thy people's weal:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But if this rede thou wilt despise.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Nor hear my last appeal,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thou with thy kin and all thy friends<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    In fight this day wilt die,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When his great bow the hero bends,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And shafts unerring fly.'<BR>
