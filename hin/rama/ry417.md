### CANTO XVIII.: RÁMA'S SPEECH.

Then Ráma's rising doubt was stilled,  
And friendly thoughts his bosom filled.  
Thus, deep in Scripture's lore, he spake:  
'The suppliant will I ne'er forsake,  
Nor my protecting aid refuse  
When one in name of friendship sues.  
Though faults and folly blot his fame,  
Pity and help he still may claim.'  
   He ceased: Sugríva bowed his head  
And pondered for a while, and said:  
   'Past number be his faults or few,  
What think ye of the Rákshas who,  
When threatening clouds of danger rise,  
Deserts his brother's side and flies?  
Say, Vánars, who may hope to find  
True friendship in his faithless kind?'  
   The son of Raghu heard his speech:  
He cast a hasty look on each  
Of those brave Vánar chiefs, and while  
Upon his lips there played a smile,  
To Lakshman turned and thus expressed  
The thoughts that moved his gallant breast:  
'Well versed in Scripture's lore, and sage  
And duly reverent to age,  
Is he, with long experience stored,  
Who counsels like this Vánar lord.  
Yet here, methinks, for searching eyea  
Some deeper, subtler matter lies.  
To you and all the world are known  
The perils of a monarch's throne,  
While foe and stranger, kith and kin  
By his misfortune trust to win.  
By hope of \*such advantage led,  
Vibhíshan o'er the sea has fled.  

He in his brother's stead would reign,  
And our alliance seeks to gain;  
And we his offer may embrace,  
A stranger and of alien race.  
But if he comes a spy and foe,  
What power has he to strike a blow  
In furtherance of his close design?  
What is his strength compared with mine?  
And can I, Vánar King, forget  
The great, the universal debt,  
Ever to aid and welcome those  
Who pray for shelter, friends or foes?  
Hast thou not heard the deathless praise  
Won by the dove in olden days,  
Who conquering his fear and hate  
Welcomed the slayer of his mate,  
And gave a banquet, to refresh  
The weary fowler, of his flesh?  
Now hear me, Vánar King, rehearse  
What Kandu  <span id="fr_939"></span>[1](#fn_939.md) spoke in ancient
verse,  
Saint Kanva's son who loved the truth  
And clave to virtue from his youth:  
'Strike not the suppliant when he stands  
And asks thee with beseeching hands  
For shelter: strike him not although  
He were thy father's mortal foe.  
No, yield him, be he proud or meek,  
The shelter which he comes to seek,  
And save thy foeman, if the deed  
Should cost thy life, in desperate need.'  
And shall I hear the wretched cry,  
And my protecting aid deny?  
Shall I a suppliant's prayer refuse,  
And heaven and glory basely lose?  
No, I will do for honour sake  
E'en as the holy Kandu spake,  
Preserve a hero's name from stain,  
And bliss in heaven and glory gain.  
Bound by a solemn vow I sware  
That all my saving help should share  
Who sought me in distress and cried,  
'Thou art my hope, and none beside,'  
Then go, I pray thee, Vánar King,  
Vibhíshan to my presence bring.  
Yea, were he Rávan's self, my vow  
Forbids me to reject him now.'  
   He ceased: the Vánar king approved;  
And Ráma toward Vibhíshan moved.  
So moves, a brother God to greet,  
Lord Indra from his heavenly seat.
