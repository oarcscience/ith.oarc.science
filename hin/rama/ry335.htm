Then from the flood Samp&aacute;ti paid<BR>
Due offerings to his brother's shade.<BR>
He bathed him when the rites were done.<BR>
And spake again to B&aacute;li's son:<BR>
'Now listen, Prince, while I relate<BR>
How first I learned the lady's fate.<BR>
Burnt by the sun's resistless might<BR>
I fell and lay on Vindhya's height.<BR>
Seven nights in deadly swoon I passed,<BR>
But struggling life returned at last.<BR>
Around I bent my wondering view,<BR>
But every spot was strange and new.<BR>
I scanned the sea with eager ken,<BR>
And rock and brook and lake and glen,<BR>
I saw gay trees their branches wave,<BR>
And creepers mantling o'er the cave.<BR>
I heard the wild birds' joyous song,<BR>
And waters as they foamed along,<BR>
And knew the lovely hill must be<BR>
Mount Vindhya by the southern sea.<BR>

Revered by heavenly beings, stood<BR>
Near where I lay, a sacred wood,<BR>
Where great Nis'akar dwelt of yore<BR>
And pains of awful penance bore.<BR>
Eight thousand seasons winged their flight<BR>
Over the toiling anchorite--<BR>
Upon that hill my days were spent,--<BR>
And then to heaven the hermit went.<BR>
At last, with long and hard assay,<BR>
Down from that height I made my way,<BR>
And wandered through the mountain pass<BR>
Rough with the spikes of Darbha grass.<BR>
I with my misery worn, and faint<BR>
Was eager to behold the saint:<BR>
For often with Jat&aacute;yus I<BR>
Had sought his home in days gone by.<BR>
As nearer to the grove I drew<BR>
The breeze with cooling fragrance blew,<BR>
And not a tree that was not fair,<BR>
With richest flower and fruit was there.<BR>
With anxious heart a while I stayed<BR>
Beneath the trees' delightful shade,<BR>
Aud soon the holy hermit, bright<BR>
With fervent penance, came in sight.<BR>
Behind him bears and lions, tame<BR>
As those who know their feeder, came,<BR>
And tigers, deer, and snakes pursued<BR>
His steps, a wondrous multitude,<BR>
And turned obeisant when the sage<BR>
Had reached his shady hermitage.<BR>
Then came Nis'&aacute;kar to my side<BR>
And looked with wondering eyes, and cried:<BR>
'I knew thee not, so dire a change<BR>
Has made thy form and feature strange.<BR>
Where are thy glossy feathers? where<BR>
The rapid wings that cleft the air?<BR>
Two vulture brothers once I knew:<BR>
Each form at will could they endue.<BR>
They of the vulture race were kings,<BR>
And flew with M&aacute;taris'va's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_776"></A><A HREF="ry336.htm#fn_776"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> wings.<BR>
In human shape they loved to greet<BR>
Their hermit friend, and clasp his feet,<BR>
The younger was Jat&aacute;yus, thou<BR>
The elder whom I gaze on now.<BR>
Say, has disease or foeman's hate<BR>
Reduced thee from thy high estate?<BR>
