<P>
They stood where trees of densest green<BR>
Wove round their forms a veiling screen.<BR>
O'er all the garden's pleasant shade<BR>
The eyes of King Sugr&iacute;va strayed,<BR>

<P>
And, as on grass and tree he gazed,<BR>
The fires of wrath within him blazed.<BR>
Then like a mighty cloud on high,<BR>
When roars the tempest through the sky,<BR>
Girt by his friends he thundered out<BR>
His dread sky-rending battle-shout<BR>
Like some proud lion in his gait,<BR>
Or as the sun begins his state,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va let his quick glance rest<BR>
On R&aacute;ma whom he thus addressed:<BR>
'There is the seat of B&aacute;li's sway.<BR>
Where flags on wall and turret play,<BR>
Which mighty bands of V&aacute;nars hold,<BR>
Rich in all arms and store of gold.<BR>
Thy promise to thy mind recall<BR>
That B&aacute;li by thy hand shall fall.<BR>
As kindly fruits adorn the bough.<BR>
So give my hopes their harvest now.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In suppliant tone the V&aacute;nar prayed,<BR>
And Raghu's son his answer made<BR>
'By Lakshman''s hand this flowery twine<BR>
Was wound about thee for a sign.<BR>
The wreath of giant creeper throws<BR>
About thy form its brillant glows,<BR>
As though about the sun were set<BR>
The bright stars for a coronet.<BR>
One shaft of mine this day, dear friend,<BR>
Thy sorrow and thy fear shall end.<BR>
And, from the bowstring freed, shall be<BR>
Giver of freedom, King, to thee.<BR>
Then come, Sugr&iacute;va, quickly show,<BR>
Where'er he lie, thy bitter foe;<BR>
And let my glance the wretch descry<BR>
Whose deeds, a brother's name belie.<BR>
Yea, soon in dust and blood o'erthrown<BR>
Shall B&aacute;li fall and gasp and groan.<BR>
Once let this eye the foeman see,<BR>
Then, if he live to turn and flee,<BR>
Despise my puny strength and shame<BR>
With foul opprobrium R&aacute;ma's name.<BR>
Hast thou not seen his hand, O King,<BR>
Through seven tall trees one arrow wing?<BR>
Stili in that strength securely trust,<BR>
And deem thy foeman in the dust,<BR>
In all my days, though surely tried<BR>
By grief and woe, I ne'er have lied;<BR>
And still by duty's law restrained<BR>
Will ne'er with falsehood's charge be stained.<BR>
Cast doubt away: the oath I sware<BR>
Its kindly fruit shall quickly bear,<BR>
As smiles the land with golden grain<BR>
By mercy of the Lord of rain.<BR>
Oh, warrior to the gate I defy<BR>
Thy foe with shout and battle-cry.<BR>
Till B&aacute;li with his chain of gold<BR>
Come speeding from his royal hold.<BR>
Blood hearts, with warlike fire aglow,<BR>
Brook not the challenge of a foe:<BR>
Each on his power and might relies,<BR>
And most before his fathers eyes.<BR>

<P>
King B&aacute;li loves the fray too well<BR>
To linger in his citadel,<BR>
And, when he hears thy battle-shout,<BR>
All wild for war will hasten out.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke. Sugr&iacute;va raised a cry<BR>
That shook and rent the echoing sky,<BR>
A shout so fierce and loud and dread<BR>
That stately bulls in terror fled,<BR>
Like dames who fly from threatened stain<BR>
In some ignoble monarch's reign.<BR>
The deer in wild confusion ran<BR>
Like horses turned in battle's van.<BR>
Down fell the birds, like Gods who fall<BR>
When merits fail,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_579"></A><A HREF="ry289.htm#fn_579"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, at that dread call.<BR>
So fiercely, boldened for the fray,<BR>
The offspring of the Lord of Day<BR>
Sent forth his furious shout as loud<BR>
As thunder from a labouring cloud,<BR>
Or, where the gale blows fresh and free,<BR>
The roaring of the troubled sea.<BR>
