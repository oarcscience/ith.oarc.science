### CANTO LI.: THE COMBAT.

Rávan's red eyes in fury rolled:  
Bright with his armlets' flashing gold,  
In high disdain, by passion stirred  
He rushed against the sovereign bird.  
With clash and din and furious blows  
Of murderous battle met the foes:  
Thus urged by winds two clouds on high  
Meet warring in the stormy sky.  
Then fierce the dreadful combat raged  
As fiend and bird in war engaged,  
As if two winged mountains sped  
To dire encounter overhead.  
Keen pointed arrows think and fast,  
In never ceasing fury cast,  
Rained hurtling on the vulture king  
And smote him on the breast and wing.  
But still that noblest bird sustained  
The cloud of shafts which Rávan rained,  
And with strong beak and talons' bent  
The body of his foeman rent.  
Then wild with rage the ten-necked king  
Laid ten swift arrows on his string,-  
Dread as the staff of Death were they,  
So terrible and keen to slay,  
Straight to his ear the string he drew,  
Straight to the mark the arrows flew,  
And pierced by every iron head  
The vulture's mangled body bled.  
One glance upon the car he bent  
Where Sítá wept with shrill lament,  
Then heedless of his wounds and pain  
Rushed at the giant king again.  
Then the brave vulture with the stroke  
Of his resistless talons broke  
The giant's shafts and bow whereon  
The fairest pearls and jewels shone.  
The monster paused by rage unmanned:  
A second bow soon armed his hand.  
Whence pointed arrows swift and true  
In hundreds, yea in thousands, flew.  
The monarch of the vultures, plied  
With ceaseless darts on every side.  
Showed like bird that turns to rest  
Close covered by the branch-built nest.  
He shook his pinions to repel  
The storm of arrows as it fell;  
Then with his talons snapped in two  
The mighty bow which Rávan drew,  
Next with terrific wing he smote  
So fiercely on the giant's coat,  
The harness, glittering with the glow  
Of fire, gave way beneath the blow.  
With storm of murderous strokes he beat  
The harnessed asses strong and fleet,-  
Each with a goblin's monstrous face  
And plates of gold his neck to grace.  
Then on the car he turned his ire,-  
The will-moved car that shone like fire,  
And broke the glorious chariot, broke  
The golden steps and pole and yoke.  
The chouris and the silken shade  
Like the full moon to view displayed,  
Together with the guards who held  
Those emblems, to the ground he felled.  
The royal vulture hovered o'er  
The driver's head, and pierced and tore  
With his strong beak and dreaded claws  
His mangled brow and cheek and jaws.  
With broken car and sundered bow,  
His charioteer and team laid low,  
One arm about the lady wound,  
Sprang the fierce giant to the ground.  
Spectators of the combat, all  
The spirits viewed the monster's fall:  
Lauding the vulture every one  
Cried with glad voice, Well done! well done!  
But weak with length of days, at last  
The vulture's strength was failing fast.  
The fiend again assayed to bear  
The lady through the fields of air.  
But when the vulture saw him rise  
Triumphant with his trembling prize,  
Bearing the sword that still was left  
When other arms were lost or cleft,  
Once more, impatient of repose,  
Swift from the earth her champion rose,  
Hung in the way the fiend would take,  
And thus addressing Rávan spake:  
'Thou, King of giants, rash and blind,  
Wilt be the ruin of thy kind,  
Stealing the wife of Ráma, him  
With lightning sears on chest and limb.  
A mighty host obeys his will  
And troops of slaves his palace fill;  

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>  

His lords of state are wise and true,  
Kinsmen has he and retinue.  
As thirsty travellers drain the cup,  
Thou drinkest deadly poison up.  
The rash and careless fool who heeds  
No coming fruit of guilty deeds,  
A few short years of life shall see,  
And perish doomed to death like thee.  
Say whither wilt thou fly to loose  
Thy neck from Death's entangling noose.  
Caught like the fish that finds too late  
The hook beneath the treacherous bait?  
Never, O King--of this be sure--  
Will Raghu's fiery sons endure,  
Terrific in their vengeful rage,  
This insult to their hermitage.  
Thy guilty hands this day have done  
A deed which all reprove and shun,  
Unworthly of a noble chief,  
The pillage loved by coward thief.  
Stay, if thy heart allow thee, stay  
And meet me in the deadly fray.  
Soon shall thou stain the earth with gore,  
And fall as Khara fell before.  
The fruits of former deeds o'erpower  
The sinner in his dying hour:  
And such a fate on thee, O King,  
Thy tyranny and madness bring.  
Not e'en the Self-existent Lord,  
Who reigns by all the worlds adored,  
Would dare attempt a guilty deed  
Which the dire fruits of crime succeed.'  
   Thus brave Jatayus, best of birds,  
Addressed the fiend with moving words,  
Then ready for the swift attack  
Swooped down upon the giant's back.  
Down to the bone the talons went  
With many a wound the flesh was rent:  
Such blows infuriate drivers deal  
Their elephants with pointed steel.  
Fixed in his back the strong beak lay,  
The talons stripped the flesh away.  
He fought with claws and beak and wing.  
And tore the long hair of the king.  
Still as the royal vulture beat  
The giant with his wings and feet,  
Swelled the fiend's lips, his body shook  
With furious rage too great to brook.  
About the Maithil dame he cast  
One huge left aim and held her fast.  
In furious rage to frenzy fanned  
He struck the vulture with his hand.  
Jatáyus mocked the vain assay,  
And rent his ten left arms away.  
Down dropped the severed limbs: anew  
Ten others from his body grew:  
Thus bright with pearly radiance glide  
Dread serpents from the hillock side,  
Again in wrath the giant pressed  
The lady closer to his breast,  
And foot and fist sent blow on blow  
In ceaseless fury at the foe.  
So fierce and dire the battle, waged  
Between those mighty champions, raged;  
Here was the lord of giants, there  
The noblest of the birds of air.  
Thus, as his love of Ráma taught,  
The faithful vulture strove and fought.  
But Rávan seized his sword and smote  
His wings and side and feet and throat.  
At mangled side and wing he bled;  
He fell, and life was almost fled.  
The lady saw her champion lie,  
His plumes distained with gory dye,  
And hastened to the vulture's side  
Grieving as though a kinsman died.  
The lord of Lanká's island viewed  
     The vulture as he lay:  
   Whose back like some dark cloud was hued,  
     His breast a paly grey,  
   Like ashes, when by none renewed.  
     The flame has died away.  
   The lady saw with mournful eye,  
     Her champion press the plain,--  
   The royal bird, her true ally  
     Whom Rávan's might had slain.  
   Her soft arms locked in strict embrace  
     Around his neck she kept.  
   And lovely with her moon-bright face  
     Bent o'er her friend and wept,
