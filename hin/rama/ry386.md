### CANTO XLVIIL: HANUMÁN CAPTURED.

To Indrajit  <span id="fr_885"></span>[1b](#fn_885) the bold and brave  
The giant king his mandate gave:  
'O trained in warlike science, best  
In arms of all our mightiest,  
Whose valour in the conflict shown  
To Asurs and to Gods is known,  
The Kinkars whom I sent are slain,  
And Jambumálí and his train;  
The lords who led our giant bands  
Have fallen by the monkey s hands;  
With shattered cars the ground is spread,  
And Aksha lies amid the dead.  
Thou art my best and bravest: go,  
Unmatched in power, and slay the foe.'  

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>  

He heard the hest: he bent his head;  
Athirst for battle forth he sped.  
Four tigers fierce, of tawny hue,  
With fearful teeth, his chariot drew.  
   Hanúmán heard his strong bow clang,  
And swiftly from the earth he sprang,  
While weak and ineffective fell  
The archer's shafts though pointed well.  
The Rákshas saw that naught might kill  
The wondrous foe who mocked his skill,  
And launched a magic shaft to throw  
A binding spell about his foe.  
Forth flew the shaft: the mystic charm  
Stayed his swift feet and numbed his arm.  
Through all his frame he felt the spell,  
And motionless to earth he fell.  
Nor would the reverent Vánar loose  
The bonds that bound him as a noose.  
He knew that Brahmá's self had charmed  
The weapon that his might disarmed.  
   They saw him helpless on the ground,  
And all the giants pressed around,  
And bonds of hemp and bark were cast  
About his limbs to hold him fast.  
They drew the ropes round feet and wrists;  
They beat him with their hands and fists.  
And dragged him as they strained the cord  
With shouts of triumph to their lord.  <span
