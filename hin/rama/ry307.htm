<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXIII.: LAKSHMAN'S ENTRY.</H3>
<P>
Through the fair city Lakshman came,<BR>
Invited in Sugr&iacute;va's name.<BR>
Within the gates the guardian bands,<BR>
Of V&aacute;nars raised their suppliant hands,<BR>
And in their ordered ranks, amazed,<BR>
Upon the princely hero gazed,<BR>
They marked each burning breath he drew,<BR>
The fury of his soul they knew.<BR>
Their hearts were chilled with sudden fear;<BR>
They gazed, but dared not venture near,<BR>
Before his eyes the city, gay<BR>
With gems and flowery gardens, lay,<BR>
Where *fane and palace rose on high,<BR>
And things of beauty charmed the eye.<BR>
Where trees of every blossom grew<BR>
Yielding their fruit in season due<BR>
To V&aacute;nars of celestial seed<BR>
Who wore each varied form at need,<BR>
Fair-faced and glorious with the shine<BR>
Of heavenly robes and wreaths divine.<BR>
There sandal, aloe, lotus bloomed,<BR>
And there delicious breath perfumed<BR>
The city's broad street, redolent<BR>
Df sugary mead&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_638"></A><A HREF="#fn_638"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> and honey scent.<BR>
There many a lofty palace rose<BR>
Like Vindhya or the Lord of Snows,<BR>
And with sweet murmur sparkling rills<BR>
Leapt lightly down the sheltering hills.<BR>
On many a glorious palace, raised<BR>
For prince and noble,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_639"></A><A HREF="#fn_639"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> Lakshman gazed:<BR>
Like clouds of paly hue they shone<BR>
With fragrant wreaths that hung thereon:<BR>
There wealth of jewels was enshrined,<BR>
And fairer gems of womankind.<BR>
There gleamed, of noble height and size,<BR>
Like Indra's mansion in the skies,<BR>
Protected by a crystal fence<BR>
Of rock, the royal residence,<BR>
With roof and turret high and bright<BR>
Like Mount Kail&aacute;sa's loftiest height.<BR>
There blooming trees, Mahendra's gift,<BR>
High o'er the walls were seen to lift<BR>
Their golden fruited boughs, that made<BR>
With leaf and flower delicious shade.<BR>
He saw a band of V&aacute;nars wait,<BR>

Wieiding their weapons, at the gate<BR>
Where golden portals flashed between<BR>
Celestial garlands red and green.<BR>
Within Sugriva's fair abode<BR>
Unchecked the mighty hero strode,<BR>
As when the sun of autumn shrouds<BR>
His glory in a pile of clouds.<BR>
Through seven wide courts he quickly passed,<BR>
And reached the royal tower at last,<BR>
Where seats were set with couch and bed<BR>
Of gold and silver richly spread.<BR>
While the young chieftain's feet drew near<BR>
The sound of music reached his ear,<BR>
As the soft breathings of the flute<BR>
Came blending with the voice and lute.<BR>
Then beauty showed her youth and grace<BR>
And varied charm of form and face:<BR>
Soft bright-eyed creatures, fair and young,--<BR>
Gay garlands round their necks were hung,<BR>
And greater charms to each were lent<BR>
By richest dress and ornament.<BR>
He saw the calm attendants wait<BR>
About their lord in careless state,<BR>
Heard women's girdles chime in sweet<BR>
Accordance with their tinkling feet.<BR>
He heard the anklet's silvery sound,<BR>
He saw the calm that reigned around,<BR>
And o'er him, as he listened, came<BR>
A rush of rage, a flood of shame.<BR>
He drew his bowstring: with the clang<BR>
From ease to west the welkin rang:<BR>
Then in his modest mood withdrew<BR>
A little from the ladies' view.<BR>
And sternly silent stood apart.<BR>
While wrath for R&aacute;ma filled his heart.<BR>
Sugriva knew the sounding string,<BR>
And at the call the V&aacute;nar king<BR>
Sprang swiftly from his golden seat,<BR>
And feared the coming prince to meet.<BR>
Then with cold lips that terror dried<BR>
To beauteous T&aacute;r&aacute; thus he cried:<BR>
'What cause of anger, O my spouse<BR>
Fair with the charm of lovely brows,<BR>
Sets Lakshman's gentle breast on fire,<BR>
And brings him in unwonted ire?<BR>
Say, canst thou see, O faultless dame,<BR>
A cause to till his soul with flame?<BR>
For there must be a reason when<BR>
Such fury stirs the king of men.<BR>
Reveal the sin, if sin of mine<BR>
Anger the lord of Raghu's line.<BR>
Or go thyself, his rage subdue,<BR>
And with soft words his favour woo.<BR>
Soon as on thee his eyes are set<BR>
His heart this anger will forget,<BR>
For men like him of lofty mind<BR>
Are never stern with womankind.<BR>
First let thy gentle speech disarm<BR>
His fury, and his spirit charm,<BR>

<P>
And I, from fear of peril free,<BR>
The conqueror of his foes will see.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  She heard: with faltering steps and slow,<BR>
With eyes that shone with trembling glow.<BR>
With gold-girt body gently bent<BR>
To meet the stranger prince she went.<BR>
When Lakshman saw the V&aacute;nar queen<BR>
With tranquil eyes and modest mien,<BR>
Before the dame he bent his head,<BR>
And anger, at her presence, fled.<BR>
Made bold by draughts of wine, and cheered<BR>
By Lakshman look no more she feared,<BR>
And in the trust his favour lent<BR>
She thus addressed him eloquent:<BR>
'Whence springs thy burning fury? say;<BR>
Who dares thy will to disobey?<BR>
Who checks the maddened flames that seize<BR>
On forests full of withered trees?<BR>
&nbsp; Then Lakshman spoke, her mind to ease,<BR>
His kind reply in words like these:<BR>
&nbsp; 'Thy lord his days in pleasure spends,<BR>
Heedless of duty and of friends.<BR>
Nor dost thou mark, though fondly true,<BR>
The evil path his steps pursue.<BR>
He cares not for affairs of state,<BR>
Nor us forlorn and desolate,<BR>
But sits a mere spectator still,<BR>
A sensual slave to pleasure's will.<BR>
Four months were fixed, the time agreed<BR>
When he should help us in our need:<BR>
But, bound in toils of pleasure fast,<BR>
He sees not that the months are past.<BR>
Where beats the heart which draughts of wine<BR>
To virtue or to gain incline?<BR>
Hast thou nor heard those draughts destroy<BR>
Virtue and gain and love and joy?<BR>
For those who, helped at need, refuse<BR>
Their aid in turn, their virtue lose:<BR>
And they who scorn a friend disdain<BR>
A treasure naught may buy again.<BR>
Thy lord has cast his friend away,<BR>
Nor feared from virtue's path to stray.<BR>
If this he true, declare, O dame<BR>
Who knowest duty's every claim.<BR>
What further work remains for us<BR>
Deceived and disappointed thus.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  She listened, for his words were kind.<BR>
Where virtue showed with gain combined,<BR>
And thus in turn the prince addressed,<BR>
As hope was rising in his breast:<BR>
'No time, no cause of wrath I see<BR>
With those who live and honour thee:<BR>
And thou shouldst bear without offence<BR>
Thy servant's fitful negligence.<BR>
I know the seasons glide away,<BR>
While R&aacute;ma maddens at delay<BR>
I know what deed our thanks has earned,<BR>
I know that grace shonld be returned<BR>
But still I know, whatever befall,<BR>
That conquering love is lord of all;<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_366"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 366</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Know where Sugr&iacute;va's thoughts, possessed<BR>
By one absorbing passion, rest.<BR>
But he whom sensual joys debase<BR>
Heeds not the claim of time and place,<BR>
And sees not with his blinded sight<BR>
His duty or his gain aright.<BR>
O pardon him who loves me! spare<BR>
The V&aacute;nar caught in pleasure's snare,<BR>
And once again let R&aacute;ma grace<BR>
With favour him who rules our race.<BR>
E'en royal saints, whose chief delight<BR>
Was penance and austerest rite,<BR>
At love's commandment have unbent,<BR>
Beguiled by sweetest blandishment.<BR>
And know, Sugr&iacute;va, roused at last,<BR>
The order to his lords has passed.<BR>
And, long by love and bliss delayed.<BR>
Wakes all on fire your hopes to aid.<BR>
A countless host his city fills,<BR>
New-gathered from a thousand hills:<BR>
Impetuous chiefs, who wear at need<BR>
Each varied form, his legions lead.<BR>
Come then, O hero, kept aloof<BR>
By modest awe, nor fear reproof:<BR>
A faithful friend untouched by blame<BR>
May look upon another's dame.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He passed within, by T&aacute;r&aacute; pressed,<BR>
And by his own impatient breast.<BR>
Refulgent there in sunlike sheen<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va on his throne was seen.<BR>
Gay garlands round his neck were twined,<BR>
And Rum&aacute; by her lord recline.<BR>
