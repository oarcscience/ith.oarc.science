### CANTO LXXXI.: THE ASSEMBLY.

Ere yet the dawn had ushered in  
The day should see the march begin,  
Herald and bard who rightly knew  
Each nice degree of honour due,  
Their loud auspicious voices raised.  
And royal Bharat blessed and praised.  
With sticks of gold the drum they smote,  
Which thundered out its deafening note,  
Blew loud the sounding shell, and blent  
Each high and low-toned instrument.  
The mingled sound of drum and horn  
Through all the air was quickly borne,  
And as in Bharat's ear it rang,  
Gave the sad prince another pang.  
  Then Bharat starting from repose,  
Stilled the glad sounds that round him rose,  
'I am not king--no more mistake:'  
Then to S'atrughna thus he spake:  
'O see what general wrongs succeed  
Sprung from Kaikeyí's evil deed!  
The king my sire has died and thrown  
Fresh miseries on me alone.  
The royal bliss, on duty based.  
Which our just high-souled father graced,  
Wanders in doubt and sore distress  
Like a tossed vessel rudderless.  
And he who was our lordly stay  
Roams in the forest far away,  
Expelled by this my mother, who  
To duty's law is most untrue.'  
  As royal Bharat thus gave vent  
To bitter grief in wild lament,  
Gazing upon his face the crowd  
Of pitying women wept aloud.  
His lamentation scarce was o'er,  
When Saint Vas'ishtha, skilled in lore  
Of royal duty, dear to fame,  
To join the great assembly came.  
Girt by disciples ever true  
Still nearer to that hall he drew,  
Resplendent, heavenly to behold,  
Adorned with wealth of gems and gold:  
E'en so a man in duty tried  
Draws near to meet his virtuous bride.  
He reached his golden seat o'erlaid  
With coverlet of rich brocade.  
There sat, in all the Vedas read,  
And called the messengers, and said:  
'Go forth, let Bráhman, Warrior, peer,  
And every captain gather here:  
Let all attentive hither throng:  
Go, hasten: we delay too long.  
S'atrughna, glorious Bharat bring,  
The noble children of the king,  <span id="fr_357"></span>[1](#fn_357.md)  

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>  

Yudhájit  <span id="fr_358"></span>[1](ry160.htm#fn_358.md) and Sumantra,
all  
The truthful and the virtuous call,'  
   He ended: soon a mighty sound  
Of thickening tumult rose around,  
As to the hall they bent their course  
With car, and elephant, and horse,  
The people all with glad acclaim  
Welcomed Prince Bharat as he came:  
E'en as they loved their king to greet,  
Or as the Gods Lord Indra  <span
id="fr_359"></span>[2](ry160.htm#fn_359.md) meet.  
   The vast assembly shone as fair  
     With Bharat's kingly face  
   As Das'aratha's self were there  
     To glorify the place.  
   It gleamed like some unruffled lake  
     Where monsters huge of mould  
   With many a snake their pastime take  
     O'er shells, sand, gems, and gold.
