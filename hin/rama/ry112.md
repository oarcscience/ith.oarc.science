### CANTO XXXIV.: RÁMA IN THE PALACE.

The dark incomparable chief  
Whose eye was like a lotus leaf,  
Cried to the mournful charioteer,  
'Go tell my sire that I am here.'  

   Sumantra, sad and all dismayed,  
The chieftain's order swift obeyed.  
Within the palace doors he hied  
And saw the king, who wept and sighed.  
Like the great sun when wrapped in shade  
Like fire by ashes overlaid,  
Or like a pool with waters dried,  
So lay the world's great lord and pride,  
A while the wise Sumantra gazed  
On him whose senses woe has dazed,  
Grieving for Ráma. Near he drew  
With hands upraised in reverence due.  
With blessing first his king he hailed;  
Then with a voice that well-nigh failed,  
In trembling accents soft and low  
Addressed the monarch in his woe:  
'The prince of men, thy Ráma, waits  
Before thee at the palace gates.  
His wealth to Bráhmans he has dealt,  
And all whom in his home have dwelt.  
Admit thy son. His friends have heard  
His kind farewell and parting word,  
He longs to see thee first, and then  
Will seek the wilds, O King of men.  
He, with each princely virtue's blaze,  
Shines as the sun engirt by rays.'  

The truthful King who loved to keep  
The law profound as Ocean's deep,  
And stainless as the dark blue sky,  
Thus to Sumantra made reply:  

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>  

'Go then, Sumantra, go and call  
My wives and ladies one and all.  
Drawn round me shall they fill the place  
When I behold my Ráma's face.'  

   Quick to the inner rooms he sped,  
And thus to all the women said,  
'Come, at the summons of the king:  
Come all, and make no tarrying.'  

   Their husband's word, by him conveyed,  
Soon as they heard, the dames obeyed,  
And following his guidance all  
Came thronging to the regal hall.  
ln number half seven hundred, they,  
All lovely dames, in long array,  
With their bright eyes for weeping red,  
To stand round Queen Kaus'alyá, sped.  
They gathered, and the monarch viewed  
One moment all the multitude,  
Then to Sumantra spoke and said:  
'Now let my son be hither led.'  

   Sumantra went. Then Ráma came,  
And Lakshman, and the Maithil dame,  
And, as he led them on, their guide  
Straight to the monarch's presence hied.  
When yet far off the father saw  
His son with raised palms toward him draw,  
Girt by his ladies, sick with woes,  
Swift from his royal seat he rose.  
With all his strength the aged man  
To meet his darling Ráma ran,  
But trembling, wild with dark despair,  
Fell on the ground and fainted there.  
And Lakshman, wont in cars to ride,  
And Ráma, threw them by the side  
Of the poor miserable king,  
Half lifeless with his sorrow's sting.  
Throughout the spacious hall up went  
A thousand women's wild lament:  
'Ah Ráma!' thus they wailed and wept,  
And anklets tinkled as they stepped.  
Around his body, weeping, threw  
Their loving arms the brothers two,  
And then, with Sitá's gentle aid,  
The king upon a couch was laid.  
At length to earth's imperial lord,  
When life and knowledge were restored,  
Though seas of woe went o'er his head,  
With suppliant hand, thus Ráma said:  
'Lord ot us all, great King, thou art:  
Bid me farewell before we part,  
To Dandak wood this day I go:  
One blessing and one look bestow.  
Let Lakshman my companion be,  
And Sítá also follow me.  
With truthful pleas I sought to bend  
Their purpose; but no ear they lend.  
Now cast this sorrow from thy heart,  
And let us all, great King, depart.  
As Brahmá sends his children, so  
Let Lakshman, me, and Sítá go.'  

He stood unmoved, and watched intent  
Until the king should grant consent.  
Upon his son his eyes he cast,  
And thus the monarch spake at last:  
'O Ráma, by her arts enslaved,  
I gave the boons Kaikeyí craved,  
Unfit to reign, by her misled:  
Be ruler in thy father's stead.'  

Thus by the lord of men addressed,  
Ráma, of virtue's friends the best,  
In lore of language duly learned,  
His answer, reverent, thus returned:  
'A thousand years, O King, remain  
O'er this our city still to reign.  
I in the woods my life will lead:  
The lust of rule no more I heed.  
Nine years and five I there will spend,  
And when the portioned days shall end,  
Will come, my vows and exile o'er,  
And clasp thy feet, my King, once more.'  

A captive in the snare of truth,  
Weeping, distressed with woe and ruth,  
Thus spake the monarch, while the queen  
Kaikeyí urged him on unseen:  
'Go then, O Ráma, and begin  
Thy course unvext by fear and sin:  
Go, my beloved son, and earn  
Success, and joy, and safe return.  
So fast the bonds of duty bind.  
O Raghu's son, thy truthful mind,  
That naught can turn thee back, or guide  
Thy will so strongly fortified.  
But 0, a little longer stay.  
Nor turn thy steps this night away,  
That I one little day--alas!  
One only--with my son may pass.  
Me and thy mother do not slight,  
But stay, my son, with me to-night;  
With every dainty please thy taste,  
And seek to-morrow morn the waste  
Hard is thy task, O Raghu's son,  
Dire is the toil thou wilt not shun,  
Far to the lonely wood to flee,  
And leave thy friends for love of me.  
I swear it by my truth, believe,  
For thee, my son, I deeply grieve,  
Misguided by the traitress dame  
With hidden guile like smouldering flame.  
Now, by her wicked counsel stirred,  
Thou fain wouldst keep my plighted word.  
No marvel that my eldest born  
Would hold me true when I have sworn.'  

Then Ráma having calmly heard  
His wretched father speak each word,  
With Lakshman standing br his side  
Thus, humbly, to the King replied:  
'If dainties now my taste regale,  
To-morrow must those dainties fail.  
This day departure I prefer  
To all that wealth can minister.  
O'er this fair land, no longer mine,  
Which I, with all her realms, resign,  

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>  

Her multitudes of men, her grain,  
Her stores of wealth, let Bharat reign.  
And let the promised boon which thou  
Wast pleased to grant the queen ere now,  
Be hers in full. Be true, O King,  
Kind giver of each precious thing.  
Thy spoken word I still will heed,  
Obeying all thy lips decreed:  
And fourteen years in woods will dwell  
With those who live in glade and dell.  
No hopes of power my heart can touch,  
No selfish joys attract so much  
As son of Raghu, to fulfil  
With heart and soul my father's will.  
Dismiss, dismiss thy needless woe,  
Nor let those drowning torrents flow:  
The Lord of Rivers in his pride  
Keeps to the banks that bar his tide.  
Here in thy presence I declare;  
By thy good deeds, thy truth, I swear;  
Nor lordship, joy, nor lands I prize;  
Life, heaven, all blessings I despise.  
I wish to see thee still remain  
Most true, O King, and free from stain.  
It must not, Sire, it must not be:  
I cannot rest one hour with thee.  
Then bring this sorrow to an end,  
For naught my settled will can bend.  
I gave a pledge that binds me too,  
And to that pledge I still am true.  
Kaikeyí bade me speed away:  
She prayed me, and I answered yea.  
Pine not for me, and weep no more;  
The wood for us has joy in store,  
Filled with the wild deer's peaceful herds  
And voices of a thousand birds.  
A father is the God of each,  
Yea, e'en of Gods, so Scriptures teach:  
And I will keep my sire's decree,  
For as a God I honour thee.  
O best of men, the time is nigh,  
The fourteen years will soon pass by  
And to thine eyes thy son restore:  
Be comforted, and weep no more.  
Thou with thy firmness shouldst support  
These weeping crowds who throng the court;  
Then why, O chief of high renown,  
So troubled, and thy soul cast down?'
