<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXIII.: VAS'ISHTHA'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
While thus the hapless monarch spoke,<BR>
Paternal love his utterance broke.<BR>
Then words like these the saint returned.<BR>
And fury in his bosom burned:<BR>
'Didst thou, O King, a promise make,<BR>
And wishest now thy word to break?<BR>
A son of Raghu's line should scorn<BR>
To fail in faith, a man forsworn.<BR>
But if thy soul can bear the shame<BR>
I will return e'en as I came.<BR>
Live with thy sons, and joy be thine,<BR>
False scion of Kakutstha's line.'<BR>

<P>
As Vis'v&aacute;mitra, mighty sage,<BR>
Was moved with this tempestuous rage,<BR>
Earth rocked and reeled throughout her frame,<BR>
And fear upon the Immortals came.<BR>
But Saint Vas'ishtha, wisest seer,<BR>
Observant of his vows austere,<BR>
Saw the whole world convulsed with dread,<BR>
And thus unto the monarch said:<BR>
'Thou, born of old Ikshv&aacute;ku's seed,<BR>
Art Justice' self in mortal weed.<BR>
Constant and pious, blest by fate,<BR>
The right thou must not violate.<BR>
Thou, Raghu's son, so famous through<BR>
The triple world as just and true,<BR>
Perform thy bounden duty still,<BR>
Nor stain thy race by deed of ill<BR>
If thou have sworn and now refuse<BR>
Thou must thy store of merit lose.<BR>
Then, Monarch, let thy R&aacute;ma go,<BR>
Nor fear for him the demon foe.<BR>
The fiends shall have no power to hurt<BR>
Him trained to war or inexpert,<BR>
Nor vanquish him in battle field,<BR>
For Kus'ik's son the youth will shield.<BR>
He is incarnate Justice, he<BR>
The best of men for bravery.<BR>
Embodied love of penance drear,<BR>
Among the wise without a peer.<BR>

Full well he knows, great Kus'ik's son,<BR>
The arms celestial, every one,<BR>
Arms from the Gods themselves concealed,<BR>
Far less to other men revealed.<BR>
These arms to him, when earth he swayed,<BR>
Mighty Kris'&aacute;s'va, pleased, conveyed.<BR>
Kris'&aacute;s'va's sons they are indeed,<BR>
Brought forth by Daksha's lovely seed, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="ry026.htm#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Heralds of conquest, strong and bold,<BR>
Brilliant, of semblance manifold.<BR>
Jay&aacute; and Vijay&aacute;, most fair,<BR>
And hundred splendid weapons bare.<BR>
Of Jay&aacute;, glorious as the morn,<BR>
First fifty noble sons were born.<BR>
Boundless in size yet viewless too,<BR>
They came the demons to subdue.<BR>
And fifty children also came<BR>
Of Vijay&aacute; the beauteous dame,<BR>
Samh&aacute;ras named, of mighty force,<BR>
Hard to assail or check in course.<BR>
Of these the hermit knows the use,<BR>
And weapons new can he produce.<BR>
All these the mighty saint will yield<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's hand, to own and wield;<BR>
And armed with these, beyond a doubt<BR>
Shall R&aacute;ma put those fiends to rout.<BR>
For R&aacute;ma and the people's sake,<BR>
For thine own good my counsel take,<BR>
Nor seek, O King, with fond delay,<BR>
The parting of thy son to stay,'<BR>
