<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXX.: KHARA'S DEATH.</H3>
<P>
When R&aacute;ma, pride of Raghu's race,<BR>
Virtue's dear son, had cleft the mace,<BR>
Thus with superior smile the best<BR>
Of chiefs the furious fiend addressed:<BR>

<P>
'Thou, worst of giant blood, at length<BR>
Hast shown the utmost of thy strength,<BR>
And forced by greater might to bow,<BR>
Thy vaunting threats are idle now.<BR>
My shafts have cut thy club in twain:<BR>
Useless it lies upon the plain,<BR>
And all thy pride and haughty trust<BR>
Lie with it levelled in the dust.<BR>
The words that thou hast said to-day,<BR>
That thou wouldst wipe the tears away<BR>
Of all the giants I have slain,<BR>
My deeds shall render void and vain.<BR>
Thou meanest of the giants' breed,<BR>
Evil in thought and word and deed.<BR>
My hand shall take that life of thine<BR>
As Garud&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_477"></A><A HREF="#fn_477"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> seized the juice divine.<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_264"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 264</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Thou, rent by shafts, this day shalt die:<BR>
Low on the ground thy corse shall lie,<BR>
And bubbles from the cloven neck<BR>
With froth and blood thy skin shall deck,<BR>
With dust and mire all rudely dyed,<BR>
Thy torn arms lying by thy side,<BR>
While streams of blood each limb shall steep,<BR>
Thou on earth's breast shalt take thy sleep<BR>
Like a fond lover when he strains<BR>
The beauty whom at length he gains.<BR>
Now when thy heavy eyelids close<BR>
For ever in thy deep repose,<BR>
Again shall Dandak forest be<BR>
Safe refuge for the devotee.<BR>
Thou slain, and all thy race who held<BR>
The realm of Janasth&aacute;n expelled,<BR>
Again shall happy hermits rove,<BR>
Fearing no danger, through the grove.<BR>
Within those bounds, their brethren slain,<BR>
No giant shall this day remain,<BR>
But all shall fly with many a tear<BR>
And fearing, rid the saints of fear,<BR>
This bitter day shall misery bring<BR>
On all the race that calls thee king.<BR>
Fierce as their lord, thy dames shall know,<BR>
Bereft of joys, the taste of woe.<BR>
Base, cruel wretch, of evil mind,<BR>
Plaguer of Br&aacute;hmans and mankind,<BR>
With trembling hands each devotee<BR>
Feeds holy tires in dread of thee.'<BR>

<P>
Thus with wild fury unrepressed<BR>
Raghu's brave son the fiend addressed;<BR>
And Khara, as his wrath grew high,<BR>
Thus thundered forth his fierce reply:<BR>

<P>
'By senseless pride to madness wrought,<BR>
By danger girt thou fearest naught,<BR>
Nor heedest, numbered with the dead,<BR>
What thou shouldst say and leave unsaid.<BR>
When Fate's tremendous coils enfold<BR>
The captive in resistless hold,<BR>
He knows not right from wrong, each sense<BR>
Numbed by that deadly influence.'<BR>

<P>
He spoke, and when his speech was done<BR>
Bent his fierce brows on Raghu's son.<BR>
With eager eyes he looked around<BR>
If lethal arms might yet be found.<BR>
Not far away and full in view<BR>
A S&aacute;l-tree towering upward grew.<BR>
His lips in mighty strain compressed,<BR>
He tore it up with root and crest,<BR>
With huge arms waved it o'er his head<BR>
And hurled it shouting, Thou art dead.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma, unsurpassed in might.<BR>
Stayed with his shafts its onward flight,<BR>
And furious longing seized his soul<BR>
The giant in the dust to roll.<BR>
Great drops of sweat each limb bedewed,<BR>
His red eyes showed his wrathful mood.<BR>
A thousand arrows, swiftly sent,<BR>
The giant's bosom tore and rent<BR>
From every gash his body showed<BR>
The blood in foamy torrents flowed,<BR>
As springing from their caverns leap<BR>
Swift rivers down the mountain steep.<BR>
When Khara felt each deadened power<BR>
Yielding beneath that murderous shower,<BR>
He charged, infuriate with the scent<BR>
Of blood, in dire bewilderment.<BR>
But R&aacute;ma watched, with ready bow,<BR>
The onset of his bleeding foe,<BR>
And ere the monster reached him, drew<BR>
Backward in haste a yard or two.<BR>
Then from his side a shaft be took<BR>
Whose mortal stroke no life might brook:<BR>
Of peerless might, it bore the name<BR>
Of Brahm&aacute;'s staff, and glowed with flame:<BR>
Lord Indra, ruler of the skies,<BR>
Himself had given the glorious prize,<BR>
His bow the virtuous hero drew,<BR>
And at the fiend the arrow flew.<BR>
Hissing and roaring like the blast<BR>
Of tempest through the air it passed,<BR>
And fixed, by R&aacute;ma's vigour sped,<BR>
In the foe's breast its pointed head.<BR>
Then fell the fiend: the quenchless flame<BR>
Burnt furious in his wounded frame.<BR>
So burnt by Rudra Andhak&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_478"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> fell<BR>
In S'vet&aacute;ranya's silvery dell:<BR>
So Namuchi and Vritra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_479"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> died<BR>
By steaming bolts that tamed their pride:<BR>
So Bala&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_480"></A><A HREF="#fn_480"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> fell by lightning sent<BR>
By Him who rules the firmament.<BR>

<P>
Then all the Gods in close array<BR>
With the bright hosts who sing and play,<BR>
Filled full of rapture and amaze,<BR>
Sang hymns of joy in R&aacute;ma's praise,<BR>
Beat their celestial drums and shed<BR>
Rain of sweet flowers upon his head.<BR>
For three short hours had scarcely flown,<BR>
And by his pointed shafts o'erthrown<BR>
The twice seven thousand fiends, whose will<BR>
Could change their shapes, in death were still,<BR>
With Tris'iras and D&uacute;shan slain,<BR>
And Khara, leader of the train.<BR>
'O wondrous deed,' the bards began,<BR>
'The noblest deed of virtuous man!<BR>
Heroic strength that stood alone,<BR>
And firmness e'en as Vishnu's own!'<BR>

<P>
Thus having sung, the shining train<BR>
Turned to their heavenly homes again.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Then the high saints of royal race<BR>
And loftiest station sought the place,<BR>
And by the great Agastya led,<BR>
With reverence to R&aacute;ma said:<BR>

<P>
'For this, Lord Indra, glorious sire,<BR>
Majestic as the burning fire,<BR>
Who crushes cities in his rage,<BR>
Sought S'arabhanga's hermitage.<BR>
Thou wast, this great design to aid,<BR>
Led by the saints to seek this shade,<BR>
And with thy mighty arm to kill<BR>
The giants who delight in ill.<BR>
Thou Das'aratha's noble son,<BR>
The battle for our sake hast won,<BR>
And saints in Dandak's wild who live<BR>
Their days to holy tasks can give.'<BR>

<P>
Forth from the mountain cavern came<BR>
The hero Lakshman with the dame.<BR>
And rapture beaming from his face.<BR>
Besought the hermit dwelling-place.<BR>
Then when the mighty saints had paid<BR>
Due honour for the victor's aid,<BR>
The glorious R&aacute;ma honoured too<BR>
By Lakshman to his cot withdrew.<BR>
When Sit&aacute; looked upon her lord,<BR>
His foemen slain, the saints restored,<BR>
In pride and rapture uncontrolled<BR>
She clasped him in her loving hold.<BR>
On the dead fiends her glances fell:<BR>
She saw her lord alive and well,<BR>
Victorious after toil and pain,<BR>
And Janak's child was blest again.<BR>
Once more, once more with new delight<BR>
Her tender arms she threw<BR>
Round R&aacute;ma whose victorious might<BR>
Had crushed the demon crew.<BR>
Then as his grateful reverence paid<BR>
Each saint of lofty soul,<BR>
O'er her sweet face, all fears allayed,<BR>
The flush of transport stole.<BR>
