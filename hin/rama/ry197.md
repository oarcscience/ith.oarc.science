### CANTO CXIX.: THE FOREST.

When Anasúyá, virtuous-souled,  
Had heard the tale by Sítá told,  
She kissed the lady's brow and laced  
Her loving arms around her waist.  
'With sweet-toned words distinct and clear  
Thy pleasant tale has charmed mine ear,  
How the great king thy father held  
That Maiden's Choice unparalleled.  
But now the sun has sunk from sight,  
And left the world to holy Night.  
Hark! how the leafy thickets sound  
With gathering birds that twitter round:  
They sought their food by day, and all  
Flock homeward when the shadows fall.  
See, hither comes the hermit band,  
Each with his pitcher in his hand:  
Fresh from the bath, their locks are wet,  
Their coats of bark are dripping yet.  
Here saints their fires of worship tend,  
And curling wreaths of smoke ascend:  
Borne on the flames they mount above,  
Dark as the brown wings of the dove.  
The distant trees, though well-nigh bare,  
Gloom thickenend by the evening air,  
And in the faint uncertain light  
Shut the horizon from our sight.  
The beasts that prowl in darkness rove  
On every side about the grove,  
And the tame deer, at ease reclined  
Their shelter near the altars find.  
The night o'er all the sky is spread,  
With lunar stars engarlanded,  
And risen in his robes of light  
The moon is beautifully bright,  
Now to thy lord I bid thee go:  
Thy pleasant tale has charmed me so:  
One thing alone I needs must pray,  
Before me first thyself array:  
Here in thy heavenly raiment shine,  
And glad, dear love, these eyes of mine.'

Then like a heavenly Goddess shone  
Fair Sítá with that raiment on.  
She bowed her to the matron's feet,  
Then turned away her lord to meet.  
The hero prince with joy surveyed  
His Sítá, in her robes arrayed,  
As glorious to his arms she came  
With love-gifts of the saintly dame.  
She told him how the saint to show  
Her fond affection would bestow  
That garland of celestial twine,  
Those ornaments and robes divine.  
Then Ráma's heart, nor Lakshman's less,  
Was filled with pride and happiness,  
For honours high had Sítá gained,  
Which mortal dames have scarce obtained.  
There honoured by each pious sage  
Who dwelt within the hermitage,  
Beside his darling well content  
That sacred night the hero spent.  

The princes, when the night had fled,  
Farewell to all the hermits said,  
Who gazed upon the distant shade,  
Their lustral rites and offerings paid.  
The saints who made their dwelling there  
In words like these addressed the pair:  
'O Princes, monsters fierce and fell  
Around that distant forest dwell:  
On blood from human veins they feed,  
And various forms assume at need,  
With savage beasts of fearful power  
That human flesh and blood devour.  
Our holy saints they rend and tear  
When met alone or unaware,  
And eat them in their cruel joy:  
These chase, O Ráma, or destroy.  
By this one path our hermits go  
To fetch the fruits that yonder grow:  
By this, O Prince, thy feet should stray  
Through pathless forests far away.'  

Thus by the reverent saints addressed,  
And by their prayers auspicious blessed,  
   He left the holy crowd:  
His wife and brother by his side,  
Within the mighty wood he hied.  
So sinks the Day-God in his pride  
   Beneath a bank of cloud.
