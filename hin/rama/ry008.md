### CANTO VI.: THE KING.

There reigned a king of name revered,  
To country and to town endeared,  
Great Das'aratha, good and sage.  
Well read in Scripture's holy page:  

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>  

Upon his kingdom's weal intent,  
Mighty and brave and provident;  
The pride of old Ikshváku's seed  
For lofty thought and righteous deed.  
Peer of the saints, for virtues famed,  
For foes subdued and passions tamed:  
A rival in his wealth untold  
Of Indra and the Lord of Gold.  
Like Manu first of kings, he reigned.  
And worthily his state maintained,  
For firm and just and ever true  
Love, duty, gain he kept in view,  
And ruled his city rich and free,  
Like Indra's Amarávatí.  
And worthy of so fair a place  
There dwelt a just and happy race  
   With troops of children blest.  
Each man contented sought no more,  
Nor longed with envy for the store  
   By richer friends possessed.  
For poverty was there unknown,  
And each man counted as his own  
   Kine, steeds, and gold, and grain.  
All dressed in raiment bright and clean,  
And every townsman might be seen  
With earrings, wreath, or chain.  
None deigned to feed on broken fare,  
And none was false or stingy there.  
A piece of gold, the smallest pay,  
Was earned by labour for a day.  
On every arm were bracelets worn,  
And none was faithless or forsworn,  
   A braggart or unkind.  
None lived upon another's wealth,  
None pined with dread or broken health,  
   Or dark disease of mind.  
High-souled were all. The slanderous word,  
The boastful lie, were never heard.  
Each man was constant to his vows,  
And lived devoted to his spouse.  
No other love his fancy knew,  
And she was tender, kind, and true.  
Her dames were fair of form and face,  
With charm of wit and gentle grace,  
With modest raiment simply neat,  
And winning manners soft and sweet.  
The twice-born sages, whose delight  
Was Scripture's page and holy rite,  
Their calm and settled course pursued,  
Nor sought the menial multitude.  
In many a Scripture each was versed,  
And each the flame of worship nursed,  
   And gave with lavish hand.  
Each paid to Heaven the offerings due,  
And none was godless or untrue  
   In all that holy band.  
To Bráhmans, as the laws ordain,  
The Warrior caste were ever fain  
   The reverence due to pay;  
And these the Vais'yas' peaceful crowd,  
Who trade and toil for gain, were proud  

   To honour and obey;  
And all were by the S'údras  <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md)
served,  
Who never from their duty swerved,  
Their proper worship all addressed  
To Bráhman, spirits, God, and guest.  
Pure and unmixt their rites remained,  
Their race's honour ne'er was stained.  <span
id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_70.md)  
Cheered by his grandsons, sons, and wife,  
Each passed a long and happy life.  
Thus was that famous city held  
By one who all his race excelled,  
   Blest in his gentle reign,  
As the whole land aforetime swayed  
By Manu, prince of men, obeyed  
   Her king from main to main.  
And heroes kept her, strong and brave,  
As lions guard their mountain cave:  
Fierce as devouring flame they burned,  
And fought till death, but never turned.  
Horses had she of noblest breed,  
Like Indra's for their form and speed,  
From Váhlí's  <span id="fr_71"></span>[3](#fn_71.md) hills and Sindhu's
 <span id="fr_72"></span>[4](#fn_72.md) sand,  
Vanáyu  <span id="fr_73"></span>[5](#fn_73.md) and Kámboja's land.  <span
id="fr_74"></span>[6](#fn_74.md)  

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>  

Her noble elephants had strayed  
Through Vindhyan and Himálayan shade,  
Gigantic in their bulk and height,  
Yet gentle in their matchless might.  
They rivalled well the world-spread fame  
Of the great stock from which they came,  
   Of Váman, vast of size,  
Of Mahápadma's glorious line,  
Thine, Aujan, and, Airávat, thine. <span
id="fr_75"></span>[1](ry009.htm#fn_75.md)  
   Upholders of the skies.  
With those, enrolled in fourfold class,  
Who all their mighty kin surpass,  
Whom men Matangas name,  
And Mrigas spotted black and white,  
And Bhadras of unwearied might,  
And Mandras hard to tame.  <span
id="fr_76"></span>[2](ry009.htm#fn_76.md)  
Thus, worthy of the name she bore, <span
id="fr_77"></span>[3](ry009.htm#fn_77.md)  
Ayodhyá for a league or more  
   Cast a bright glory round,  
Where Das'aratha wise and great  
Governed his fair ancestral state,  
   With every virtue crowned.  
Like Indra in the skies he reigned  
In that, good town whose wall contained  
   High domes and turrets proud,  
With gates and arcs of triumph decked,  
And sturdy barriers to protect  
   Her gay and countless crowd.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_67"></span>[12:1b](ry007.htm#fr_67.md) The *Sataghní, i. e.
centicide*, or slayer of a hundred, is generally supposed to be a sort
of fire-arms, or the ancient Indian rocket; but it is also described as
a stone set round with iron spikes.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[12:2b](ry007.htm#fr_68) The Nágas (serpents.md)
are demigods with a human face and serpent body. They inhabit Pátála or
the regions under the earth. Bhogavatí is the name of their capital
city. Serpents are still worshipped in India. See Fergusson'a *Tree and
Serpent Worship.*

<span id="fn_69"></span>[13:1](ry008.htm#fr_69.md) The fourth and lowest
pure caste whose duty was to serve the three first classes.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[13:2](ry008.htm#fr_70.md) By forbidden marriages
between persons of different castes.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[13:3](ry008.htm#fr_71.md) Váhlí or Váhlika is
Bactriana; its name is preserved in the modern Balkh.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[13:4](ry008.htm#fr_72.md) The Sanskrit word Sindhu
is in the singular the name of the river Indus, in the plural of the
people and territories on its banks. The name appears as *Hidhu* in the
cuneiform inscription of Darius son of Hystaspes, in which the nations
tributary to that king are enumerated.

The Hebrew form is *Hodda* (Esther, 1. I.) In Zend it appears as *Hendu*
in a somewhat wider sense. With the Persians later the signification of
*Hind* seems to have co-extended with their increasing acquaintance with
the country. The weak Ionic dialect omitted the Persian *h*, and we find
in Hecatæus and Herodotus *Indos* and *hae Indikae*. In this form the
Romans received the names and transmitted them to us. The Arabian
geographers in their ignorance that Hind and Sind are two forms of the
same word have made of them two brothers and traced their decent from
Noah. See Lassen's Indische Alterthumskunde Vol. I. pp. 2, 3.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[13:5](ry008.htm#fr_73.md) The situation of Vanáyu
is not exactly determined: it seems to have lain to the north-west of
India.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[13:6](ry008.htm#fr_74.md) Kámboja was probably
still further to the north-west. Lassen thinks that the <span
id="page_14">p. 14</span> name is etymologically connected with
*Cambyses* which in the cuneiform inscription of Behistun is written
Ka(m)bujia.
