### CANTO XXI.: THE ROUSING OF KHARA.

Low in the dust he saw her lie,  
And Khara's wrath grew fierce and high,  
Aloud he cried to her who came  
Disgracefully with baffled aim:  
'I sent with thee at thy request  
The bravest of my giants, best  
Of all who feed upon the slain:  
Why art thou weeping here again?  
Still to their master's interest true,  
My faithful, noble, loyal crew.  
Though slaughtered in the bloody fray.  
Would yet their monarch's word obey.  
Now I, my sister, fain would know  
The cause of this thy fear and woe,  
Why like a snake thou writhest there,  
Calling for aid in wild despair.  
Nay, lie not thus in lowly guise:  
Cast off thy weakness and arise!'  
   With soothing words the giant chief  
Assuaged the fury of her grief.  
Her weeping eyes she slowly dried  
And to her brother thus replied:  
'I sought thee in my shame and fear  
With severed nose and mangled ear:  
My gashes like a river bled,  
I sought thee and was comforted.

Those twice seven giants, brave and strong,  
Thou sentest to avenge the wrong,  
To lay the savage Ráma low,  
And Lakshman who misused me so.  
But ah, the shafts of Ráma through  
The bodies of my champions flew:  
Though madly fierce their spears they plied,  
Beneath his conquering might they died.  
I saw them, famed for strength and speed,  
I saw my heroes fall and bleed:  
Great trembling seized my every limb  
At the great deed achieved by him.  
In trouble, horror, doubt, and dread,  
Again to thee for help I fled.  
While terror haunts my troubled sight,  
I seek thee, rover of the night.  
And canst thou not thy sister free  
From this wide waste of troublous sea  
Whose sharks are doubt and terror, where  
Each wreathing wave is dark despair?  
Low lie on earth thy giant train  
By ruthless Ráma's arrows slain,  
And all the mighty demons, fed  
On blood, who followed me are dead.  
Now if within thy breast may be  
Pity for them and love for me,  
If thou, O rover of the night,  
Have valour and with him can fight,  
Subdue the giants' cruel foe  
Who dwells where Dandak's thickets grow.  
But if thine arm in vain assay  
This queller of his foes to slay,  
Now surely here before thine eyes,  
Wronged and ashamed thy sister dies.  
Too well, alas, too well I see  
That, strong in war as thou mayst be,  
Thou canst not in the battle stand  
When Ráma meets thee hand to hand.  
Go forth, thou hero but in name,  
Assuming might thou canst not claim;  
Call friend and kin, no longer stay:  
Away from Janasthán, away!  
Shame of thy race! the weak alone  
Beneath thine arm may sink o'erthrown:  
Fly Ráma and his brother: they  
Are men too strong for thee to slay.  
How canst thou hope, O weak and base,  
To make this grove thy dwelling-place?  
With Ráma's might unmeet to vie,  
O'ermastered thou wilt quickly die.  
A hero strong in valorous deed  
Is Ráma, Das'aratha's seed:  
And scarce of weaker might than he  
His brother chief who mangled me.'  
   Thus wept and wailed in deep distress  
The grim misshapen giantess:  
Before her brother's feet she lay  
O'erwhelmed with grief, and swooned away.
