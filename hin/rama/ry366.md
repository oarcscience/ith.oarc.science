### CANTO XXIV.: SÍTÁ'S REPLY.

Still with reproaches rough and rude  
Those fiends the gentle queen pursued:  
What! can so fair a life displease,  
To dwell with him in joyous ease?  
Dwell in his bowers a happy queen  
In silk and gold and jewels' sheen?  
Still must thy woman fancy cling  
To Ráma and reject our king?  
Die in thy folly, or forget  
That wretched wandering anchoret.  
Come, Sita, in luxurious bowers  
Spend with our lord thy happy hours;  
The mighty lord who makes his own  
The treasures of the worlds o'erthrown.'  

Then, as a tear bedewed her eye,  
The hapless lady made reply:  
'I loathe, with heart and soul detest  
The shameful life your words suggest.  
Eat, if you will, this mortal frame:  
My soul rejects the sin and shame.  
A homeless wanderer though he be,  
In him my lord, my life I see,  
And, till my earthly days be done,  
Will cling to great Ikshváku's son.  

Then with fierce eyes on Sítá set  
They cried again with taunt and threat:  
Each licking with her fiery tongue  
The lip that to her bosom hung,  
And menacing the lady's life  
With axe, or spear or murderous knife:  
'Hear, Sítá, and our words obey.  
Or perish by our hands to-day,  
Thy love for Raghu's son forsake,  
And Rávan for thy husband take,  
Or we will rend thy limbs apart  
And banquet on thy quivering heart.  
Now from her body strike the head,  
And tell the king the dame is dead.  
Then by our lord's commandment she  
A banquet for our band shall be.  
Come, let the wine be quickly brought  
That frees each heart from saddening thought.  
Then to the western gate repair,  
And we will dance and revel there.'
