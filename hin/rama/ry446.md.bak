### CANTO XLVII.: SITÁ.

Still on the ground where Ráma slept  
Their faithful watch the Vánars kept.  
There Angad stood o'erwhelmed with grief  
And many a lord and warrior chief;  
And, ranged in densest mass around,  
Their tree-armed legions held the ground.  
Far ranged each Vánar's eager eye,  
Now swept the land, now sought the sky,  
All fearing, if a leaf was stirred,  
A Rákshas in the sound they heard.  
The lord of Lanká in his hall,  
Rejoicing at his foeman's fall,  
Commanded and the warders came  
Who ever watched the Maithil dame.  
'Go,' cried the Rákshas king, 'relate  
To Janak's child her husband's fate.  
Low on the earth her Ráma lies,  
And dark in death are Lakshman's eyes.  
Bring forth my car and let her ride  
To view the chieftains side by side.  
The lord to whom her fancy turned  
For whose dear sake my love she spurned,  
Lies smitten, as he fiercely led  
The battle, with his brother dead.  
Lead forth the royal lady: go  
Her husband's lifeless body show.  
Then from all doubt and terror free  
Her softening heart will turn to me.'  
They heard his speech: the car was brought;  

That shady grove the warders sought  
Where, mourning Ráma night and day,  
The melancholy lady lay.  
They placed her in the car and through  
The yielding air they swiftly flew.  
The lady looked upon the plain,  
Looked on the heaps of Vánar slain,  
Saw where, triumphant in the fight,  
Thronged the fierce rovers of the night,  
And Vánar chieftains, mournful-eyed,  
Watched by the fallen brothers' side.  
There stretched upon his gory bed  
Each brother lay as lie the dead,  
With shattered mail and splintered bow  
Pierced by the arrows of the foe.  
When on the pair her eyes she bent,  
Burst from her lips a wild lament  
Her eyes o'erflowed, she groaned and sighed  
And thus in trembling accents cried:
