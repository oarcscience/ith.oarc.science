<P>
Then R&aacute;ma, that his friend might know<BR>
His strength unrivalled, grasped his bow,<BR>
That mighty bow the foe's dismay,--<BR>
And on the string an arrow lay.<BR>
Next on the tree his eye he bent,<BR>
And forth the hurtling weapon went.<BR>
Loosed from the matchless hero's hold,<BR>
That arrow, decked with burning gold,<BR>
Cleft the seven palms in line, and through<BR>
The hill that rose behind them flew:<BR>

<P>
Six subterranean realms it passed,<BR>
And reached the lowest depth at last,<BR>
Whence speeding back through earth and air<BR>
It sought the quiver, and rested there. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_574"></A><A HREF="#fn_574"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Upon the cloven trees amazed.<BR>
The sovereign of the V&aacute;nars gazed.<BR>
With all his chains and gold outspread<BR>
Prostrate on earth he laid his head.<BR>
Then, rising, palm to palm he laid<BR>
In reverent act, obeisance made,<BR>
And joyously to R&aacute;ma, best<BR>
Of war-trained chiefs, these words addressed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'What champion, Raghu's son, may hope<BR>
With thee in deadly fight to cope,<BR>
Whose arrow, leaping from the bow.<BR>
Cleaves tree and hill and earth below?<BR>
Scarce might the Gods, arrayed for strife<BR>
By Indra's self, escape, with life<BR>
Assailed by thy victorious hand:<BR>
And how may B&aacute;li hope to stand?<BR>
All grief and care are past away,<BR>
And joyous thoughts my bosom sway,<BR>
Who have in thee a friend, renowned.<BR>
As Varun &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_575"></A><A HREF="#fn_575"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> or as Indra, found.<BR>
Then on! subdue,--'tis friendship's claim,--<BR>
My foe who bears a brother's name.<BR>
Strike B&aacute;li down beneath thy feet:<BR>
With suppliant hands I thus entreat,'<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va ceased, and R&aacute;ma pressed<BR>
The grateful V&aacute;nar to his breast;<BR>
And thoughts of kindred feeling woke<BR>
In Lakshman's bosom, as he spoke:<BR>
'On to Kishkindh&aacute;, on with speed!<BR>
Thou, V&aacute;nar King, our way shalt lead,<BR>
Then challenge B&aacute;li forth to fight.<BR>
Thy foe who scorns a brother's right.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They sought Kishkindh&aacute;'s gate and stood<BR>
Concealed by trees in densest wood,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, to the fight addressed,<BR>
More closely drew his cinctured vest,<BR>
And raised a wild sky-piercing shout<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_339"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 339</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
To call the foeman B&aacute;li out.<BR>
Forth came impetuous B&aacute;li, stirred<BR>
To fury by the shout he heard.<BR>
So the great sun, ere night has ceased,<BR>
Springs up impatient to the east.<BR>
Then fierce and wild the conflict raged<BR>
As hand to hand the foes engaged,<BR>
As though in battle mid the stars<BR>
Fought Mercury and fiery Mars. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_576"></A><A HREF="#fn_576"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
To highest pitch of frenzy wrought<BR>
With fists like thunderbolts they fought,<BR>
While near them R&aacute;ma took his stand,<BR>
And viewed the battle, bow in hand.<BR>
Alike they stood in form and might,<BR>
Like heavenly As'vins &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_577"></A><A HREF="#fn_577"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> paired in fight,<BR>
Nor might the son of Raghu know<BR>
Where fought the friend and where the foe;<BR>
So, while his bow was ready bent.<BR>
No life-destroying shaft he sent.<BR>
Crushed down by B&aacute;li's mightier stroke<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va's force now sank and broke,<BR>
Who, hoping naught from R&aacute;ma's aid,<BR>
To Rishyam&uacute;ka fled dismayed,<BR>
Weary, and faint, and wounded sore,<BR>
His body bruised and dyed with gore,<BR>
From B&aacute;li's blows, in rage and dread,<BR>
Afar to sheltering woods he fled.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Nor B&aacute;li farther dared pursue,<BR>
The curbing curse too well he knew.<BR>
'Fled from thy death!' the victor cried,<BR>
And home the mighty warrior hied.<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n, Lakshman, Raghu's son<BR>
Beheld the conquered V&aacute;nar run.<BR>
And followed to the sheltering shade<BR>
Where yet Sugr&iacute;va stood dismayed.<BR>
Near and more near the chieftains came,<BR>
Then, for intolerable shame,<BR>
Not daring yet to lift his eyes,<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va spoke with burning sighs:<BR>
'Thy matchless strength I first beheld,<BR>
And dared my foe, by thee impelled.<BR>
Why hast thou tried me with deceit<BR>
And urged me to a sure defeat?<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Thou shouldst have said, 'I will not slay<BR>
Thy foeman in the coming fray.'<BR>
For had I then thy purpose known<BR>
I had not waged the fight alone.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The V&aacute;nar sovereign, lofty-souled,<BR>
In plaintive voice his sorrows told.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma spake: 'Sugr&iacute;va, list,<BR>
All anger from thy heart dismissed,<BR>
And I will tell the cause that stayed<BR>
Mine arrow, and withheld the aid.<BR>
In dress, adornment, port, and height,<BR>
In splendour, battle-shout, and might,<BR>
No shade of difference could I see<BR>
Between thy foe, O King, and thee.<BR>
So like was each, I stood at gaze,<BR>
My senses lost in wildering maze,<BR>
Nor loosened from my straining bow<BR>
A deadly arrow at the foe,<BR>
Lest in my doubt the shaft should send<BR>
To sudden death our surest friend.<BR>
O, if this hand in heedless guilt<BR>
And rash resolve thy blood had spilt,<BR>
Through every land, O V&aacute;nar King,<BR>
My wild and foolish act would ring,<BR>
Sore weight of sin on him must lie<BR>
By whom a friend is made to die;<BR>
And Lakshman, I, and S&iacute;t&aacute;, best<BR>
Of dames, on thy protection rest.<BR>
On, warrior! for the fight prepare;<BR>
Nor fear again thy foe to dare.<BR>
Within one hour thine eye shall view<BR>
My arrow strike thy foeman through;<BR>
Shall see the stricken B&aacute;li lie<BR>
Low on the earth, and gasp and die.<BR>
But come, a badge about thee bind,<BR>
O monarch of the V&aacute;nar kind.<BR>
That in the battle shock mine eyes<BR>
The friend and foe may recognize.<BR>
Come, Lakshman, let that creeper deck<BR>
With brightest bloom Sugr&iacute;va's neck,<BR>
And be a happy token, twined<BR>
Around the chief of lofty mind.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Upon the mountain slope there grew<BR>
A threading creeper fair to view,<BR>
And Lakshman plucked the bloom and round<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va's neck a garland wound,<BR>
Graced with the flowery wreath he wore,<BR>
The V&aacute;nar chief the semblance bore<BR>
Of a dark cloud at close of day<BR>
Engarlanded with cranes at play,<BR>
In glorious light the V&aacute;nar glowed<BR>
As by his comrade's side he strode.<BR>
And, still on R&aacute;ma's word intent,<BR>
His steps to great Kishkindh&aacute; bent.<BR>

Vedic Gods, corresponding in name and
partly in character to the &#0959&#8016&#0961&#0945&#0957&#8057&#0962 of
the Greeks and is often regarded as the
supreme deity. He upholds heaven and
earth, possesses extraordinary power and
wisdom, sends his messengers through
both worlds, numbers the very winkings
of men's eyes, punishes transgressors whom
he seizes with his deadly noose, and pardons
the sins of those who are penitent. In
later mythology he has become the God
of the sea.</P>
