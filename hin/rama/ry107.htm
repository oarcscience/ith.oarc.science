<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXIX.: S&Iacute;T&Aacute;'S APPEAL.</H3>
<P>
Thus R&aacute;ma spake. Her lord's address<BR>
The lady heard with deep distress.<BR>
And, as the tear bedimmed her eye,<BR>
In soft low accents made reply:<BR>
'The perils of the wood, and all<BR>
The woes thou countest to appal,<BR>
Led by my love I deem not pain;<BR>
Each woe a charm, each loss a gain,<BR>
Tiger, and elephant, and deer,<BR>
Bull, lion, buffalo, in fear,<BR>
Soon as thy matchless form they see,<BR>
With every silvan beast will flee.<BR>
With thee, O R&aacute;ma, I must go:<BR>
My sire's command ordains it so.<BR>
Bereft of thee, my lonely heart<BR>
Must break, and life and I must part.<BR>
While thou, O mighty lord, art nigh,<BR>
Not even He who rules the sky,<BR>
Though He is strongest of the strong,<BR>
With all his might can do me wrong.<BR>
Nor can a lonely woman left<BR>
By her dear husband live bereft.<BR>
In my great love, my lord, I ween,<BR>
The truth of this thou mayst have seen.<BR>
In my sire's palace long ago<BR>
I heard the chief of those who know,<BR>
The truth-declaring Br&aacute;hmans, tell<BR>
My fortune, in the wood to dwell.<BR>
I heard their promise who divine<BR>
The future by each mark and sign,<BR>
And from that hour have longed to lead<BR>
The forest life their lips decreed.<BR>
Now, mighty R&aacute;ma, I must share<BR>
Thy father's doom which sends thee there;<BR>
In this I will not be denied,<BR>
But follow, love, where thou shalt guide.<BR>
O husband, I will go with thee,<BR>
Obedient to that high decree,<BR>
Now let the Br&aacute;hmans' words be true,<BR>
For this the time they had in view.<BR>
I know full well the wood has woes;<BR>
But they disturb the lives of those<BR>
Who in the forest dwell, nor hold<BR>
Their rebel senses well controlled.<BR>

<P>
In my sire's halls, ere I was wed,<BR>
I heard a dame who begged her bread<BR>
Before my mother's face relate<BR>
What griefs a forest life await.<BR>
And many a time in sport I prayed<BR>
To seek with thee the greenwood shade,<BR>
For O, my heart on this is set,<BR>
To follow thee, dear anchoret.<BR>
May blessings on thy life attend:<BR>
I long with thee my steps to bend,<BR>
For with such hero as thou art<BR>
This pilgrimage enchants my heart.<BR>
Still close, my lord, to thy dear side<BR>
My spirit will be purified:<BR>
Love from all sin my soul will free:<BR>
My husband is a God to me.<BR>
So, love, with thee shall I have bliss<BR>
And share the life that follows this.<BR>
I heard a Brahman, dear to fame,<BR>
This ancient Scripture text proclaim:<BR>
'The woman whom on earth below<BR>
Her parents on a man bestow,<BR>
And lawfully their hands unite<BR>
With water and each holy rite,<BR>
She in this world shall be his wife,<BR>
His also in the after life.'<BR>
Then tell me, O beloved, why<BR>
Thou wilt this earnest prayer deny,<BR>
Nor take me with thee to the wood,<BR>
Thine own dear wife so true and good.<BR>
But if thou wilt not take me there<BR>
Thus grieving in my wild despair,<BR>
To fire or water I will fly,<BR>
Or to the poisoned draught, and die.'<BR>
So thus to share his exile, she<BR>
Besought him with each earnest plea,<BR>
Nor could she yet her lord persuade<BR>
To take her to the lonely shade.<BR>
The answer of the strong-armed chief<BR>
Smote the Videhan's soul with grief,<BR>
And from her eyes the torrents came<BR>
bathing the bosom of the dame.<BR>
