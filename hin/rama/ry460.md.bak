### CANTO LXIV.: MAHODAR'S SPEECH.

He ceased: and when his lips were closed  
Mahodar thus his rede opposed:  
'Why wilt thou shame thy noble birth  
And speak like one of little worth?  
Why boast thee thus in youthful pride  
Rejecting wisdom for thy guide?  
How will thy single arm oppose  
The victor of a thousand foes,  
Who proved in Janasthán his might  
And slew the rovers of the night?  
The remnant of those legions, they  
Who saw his power that fatal day.  
Now in this leaguered city dread  
The mighty chief from whom they fled.  
And wouldst thou meet the lord of men,  
Beard the great lion in his den,  
And, when thine eyes are open, break  
The slumber of a deadly snake?  
Who may an equal battle wage  
With him, so awful in his rage.  
Fierce as the God of Death whom none  
May vanquish, Das'aratha's son?  
But, Rávan, shall the lady still  
Refuse compliance with thy will?  
No, listen, King, to this design  
Which soon shall make the captive thine.  
This day through Lanka's streets proclaim  
That four of us  <span id="fr_991"></span>[1](#fn_991.md) of highest fame  
With Kumbhakarna at our head  
Will strike the son of Raghu dead.  
Forth to the battle will we go  
And prove our prowess on the foe.  
Then, if our bold attempt succeed,  
No further plans thy hopes will need.  
But if in vain our warriors strive,  
And Raghu's son be left alive,  
We will return, and, wounded sore,  
Our armour stained with gouts of gore,  
Will show the shafts that rent each frame,  
Keen arrows marked with Ráma's name,  
And say we giants have devoured  
The princes whom our might o'erpowered.  
Then let the joyful tidings spread  
That Raghu's royal sons are dead.  
To all around thy pleasure show,  
Gold, pearls, and precious robes, bestow.  
Gay garlands round the portals twine,  
Enjoy the banquet and the wine.  
Then go, the scornful lady seek,  
And woo her when her heart is weak.  

Rich robes and gold and gems display,  
And gently wile her grief away.  
Then will she feel her hopeless state,  
Widowed, forlorn, and desolate;  
Know that on thee her bliss depends,  
Far from her country and her friends;  
Then, her proud spirit overthrown,  
The lady will be all thine own.'
