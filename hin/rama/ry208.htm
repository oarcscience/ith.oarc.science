<P>
The words that S&iacute;t&aacute; uttered, spurred<BR>
By truest love, the hero heard:<BR>
Then he who ne'er from virtue strayed<BR>
To Janak's child his answer made:<BR>
'In thy wise speech, sweet love, I find<BR>
True impress of thy gentle mind,<BR>
Well skilled the warrior's path to trace,<BR>
Thou pride of Janak's ancient race.<BR>
What fitting answer shall I frame<BR>
To thy good words, my honoured dame?<BR>
Thou sayst the warrior bears the bow<BR>
That misery's tears may cease to flow;<BR>
And those pure saints who love the shade<BR>
Of Dandak wood are sore dismayed.<BR>
They sought me of their own accord,<BR>
With suppliant prayers my aid implored:<BR>
They, fed on roots and fruit, who spend<BR>
Their lives where bosky wilds extend,<BR>
My timid love, enjoy no rest<BR>
By these malignant fiends distressed.<BR>
These make the flesh of man their meat:<BR>
The helpless saints they kill and eat.<BR>
The hermits sought my side, the chief<BR>
Of Brahman race declared their grief.<BR>
I heard, and from my lips there fell<BR>
The words which thou rememberest well:<BR>
I listened as the hermits cried,<BR>
And to their prayers I thus replied:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Your favour, gracious lords, I claim,<BR>
O'erwhelmed with this enormous shame<BR>
That Br&aacute;hmans, great and pure as you,<BR>
Who should be sought, to me should sue.'<BR>
And then before the saintly crowd,<BR>
'What can I do?' I cried aloud.<BR>
Then from the trembling hermits broke<BR>
One long sad cry, and thus they spoke:<BR>
'Fiends of the wood, who wear at will<BR>
Each varied shape, afflict us still.<BR>
To thee in our distress we fly:<BR>
O help us, R&aacute;ma, or we die.<BR>
When sacred rites of fire are due,<BR>
When changing moons are full or new,<BR>
These fiends who bleeding flesh devour<BR>
Assail us with resistless power.<BR>
They with their cruel might torment<BR>
The hermits on their vows intent:<BR>
We look around for help and see<BR>
Our surest refuge, Prince, in thee.<BR>
We, armed with powers of penance, might<BR>
Destroy the rovers of the night:<BR>
But loth were we to bring to naught<BR>
The merit years of toil have bought.<BR>
Our penance rites are grown too hard,<BR>
By many a check and trouble barred,<BR>
But though our saints for food are slain<BR>
The withering curse we yet restrain.<BR>

<P>
Thus many a weary day distressed<BR>
By giants who this wood infest,<BR>
We see at length deliverance, thou<BR>
With Lakshman art our guardian now.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As thus the troubled hermits prayed,<BR>
I promised, dame, my ready aid,<BR>
And now--for truth I hold most dear--<BR>
Still to my word must I adhere.<BR>
My love, I might endure to be<BR>
Deprived of Lakshman, life, and thee,<BR>
But ne'er deny my promise, ne'er<BR>
To Br&aacute;hmans break the oath I sware.<BR>
I must, enforced by high constraint,<BR>
Protect them all. Each suffering saint<BR>
In me, unasked, his help had found;<BR>
Still more in one by promise bound.<BR>
I know thy words, mine own dear dame,<BR>
From thy sweet heart's affection came:<BR>
I thank thee for thy gentle speech,<BR>
For those we love are those we teach.<BR>
'Tis like thyself, O fair of face,<BR>
'Tis worthy of thy noble race:<BR>
Dearer than life, thy feet are set<BR>
In righteous paths they ne'er forget.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus to the Maithil monarch's child,<BR>
His own dear wife, in accents mild<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The high-souled hero said:<BR>
Then to the holy groves which lay<BR>
Beyond them fair to see, their way<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The bow-armed chieftain led.<BR>
