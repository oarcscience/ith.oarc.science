### CANTO I.: THE HERMITAGE.

When Ráma, valiant hero, stood  
In the vast shade of Dandak wood,  
His eyes on every side he bent  
And saw a hermit settlement,  
Where coats of bark were hung around,  
And holy grass bestrewed the ground.  
Bright with Bráhmanic lustre glowed  
That circle where the saints abode:  
Like the hot sun in heaven it shone,  
Too dazzling to be looked upon.  
Wild creatures found a refuge where  
The court, well-swept, was bright and fair:  
And countless birds and roedeer made  
Their dwelling in the friendly shade.  
Beneath the boughs of well-loved trees  
Oft danced the gay Apsarases.  <span id="fr_401"></span>[1](#fn_401.md)  
Around was many an ample shed  
Wherein the holy fire was fed;  
With sacred grass and skins of deer,  
Ladles and sacrificial gear,  
And roots and fruit, and wood to burn,  
And many a brimming water-urn.  
Tall trees their hallowed branches spread,  
Laden with pleasant fruit, o'erhead;  
And gifts which holy laws require,  <span
id="fr_402"></span>[2](#fn_402.md)  
And solemn offerings burnt with fire,  <span
id="fr_403"></span>[3](#fn_403.md)  
And Veda chants on every side  
That home of hermits sanctified.  
There many a flower its odour shed,  
And lotus blooms the lake o'erspred.  
There, clad in coats of bark and hide,--  
Their food by roots and fruit supplied,--  
Dwelt many an old and reverend sire  
Bright as the sun or Lord of Fire,  
All with each worldly sense subdued,  
A pure and saintly multitude.  
The Veda chants, the saints who trod  
The sacred ground and mused on God,  
Made that delightful grove appear  
Like Brahmá's own most glorious sphere.  
As Raghu's splendid son surveyed  
That hermit home and tranquil shade,  
He loosed his mighty bow-string, then  
Drew nearer to the holy men.  

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>  

With keen celestial sight endued  
Those mighty saints the chieftain viewed,  
With joy to meet the prince they came,  
And gentle Sítá dear to fame.  
They looked on virtuous Ráma, fair  
As Soma  <span id="fr_404"></span>[1](#fn_404.md) in the evening air,  
And Lakshman by his brother's side,  
And Sítá long in duty tried,  
And with glad blessings every sage  
Received them in the hermitage.  
Then Ráma's form and stature tall  
Entranced the wondering eyes of all,--  
His youthful grace, his strength of limb,  
And garb that nobly sat on him.  
To Lakshman too their looks they raised,  
And upon Sítá's beauty gazed  
With eyes that closed not lest their sight  
Should miss the vision of delight.  
Then the pure hermits of the wood,  
Rejoicing in all creatures' good,  
Their guest, the glorious Ráma, led  
Within a cot with leaves o'erhead.  
With highest honour all the best  
Of radiant saints received their guest,  
With kind observance, as is meet,  
And gave him water for his feet.  
To highest pitch of rapture wrought  
Their stores of roots and fruit they brought.  
They poured their blessings on his head,  
And 'All we have is thine,' they said.  
Then, reverent hand to hand applied,  <span
id="fr_405"></span>[2](#fn_405.md)  
Each duty-loving hermit cried:  
'The king is our protector, bright  
In fame, maintainer of the right.  
He bears the awful sword, and hence  
Deserves an elder's reverence.  
One fourth of Indra's essence, he  
Preserves his realm from danger free,  
Hence honoured by the world of right  
The king enjoys each choice delight.  
Thou shouldst to us protection give,  
For in thy realm, dear lord, we live:  
Whether in town or wood thou be,  
Thou art our king, thy people we,  
Our wordly aims are laid aside,  
Our hearts are tamed and purified.  
To thee our guardian, we who earn  
Our only wealth by penance turn.'  

Then the pure dwellers in the shade  
To Raghu's son due honour paid,  
And Lakshman, bringing store of roots,  
And many a flower, and woodland fruits.  

And others strove the prince to please  
With all attentive courtesies.
