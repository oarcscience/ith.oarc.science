<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO IX.: VIBH&Iacute;SHAN'S COUNSEL.</H3>
<P>
A score of warriors &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_924"></A><A HREF="#fn_924"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> forward sprang,<BR>
And loud the clashing iron rang<BR>
Of mace and axe and spear and sword,<BR>
As thus they spake unto their lord:<BR>
'Their king Sugr&iacute;va will we slay,<BR>
And Raghu's sons, ere close of day,<BR>
And strike the wretch Han&uacute;m&aacute;n down,<BR>
The spoiler of our golden town.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But sage Vibh&iacute;shan strove to calm<BR>
The chieftains' fury; palm to palm<BR>
He joined in lowly reverence, pressed<BR>
Before them, and the throng addressed:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_925"></A><A HREF="#fn_925"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Dismiss the hope of conquering one<BR>
So stern and strong as Raghu's son.<BR>
In due control each sense he keeps<BR>
With constant care that never sleeps.<BR>
Whose daring heart has e'er conceived<BR>
The exploit Hanum&aacute;n achieved,<BR>
Across the fearful sea to spring,<BR>
The tributary rivers' king?<BR>
O R&aacute;kshas lords, in time be wise,<BR>
Nor R&aacute;ma's matchless power despise.<BR>
And say, what evil had the son<BR>
Of Raghu to our monarch done,<BR>
Who stole the dame he loved so well<BR>
And keeps her in his citadel;<BR>
If Kharu in his foolish pride<BR>
Encountered R&aacute;ma, fought, and died,<BR>
May not the meanest love his life<BR>
And guard it in the deadly strife?<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
The Maithil dame, O R&aacute;kshas King,<BR>
Sore peril to thy realm will bring.<BR>
Restore her while there yet is time,<BR>
Nor let us perish for thy crime.<BR>
O, let the Maithil lady go<BR>
Ere the avenger bend his bow<BR>
To ruin with his arrowy showers<BR>
Our Lank&aacute; with her gates and towers.<BR>
Let Janak's child again be free<BR>
Ere the wild V&aacute;nars cross the sea,<BR>
In their resistless might assail<BR>
Our city and her ramparts scale.<BR>
Ah, I conjure thee by the ties<BR>
0f brotherhood, be just and wise.<BR>
In all my thoughts thy good I seek,<BR>
And thus my prudent counsel speak.<BR>
Let captive Sit&aacute; be restored<BR>
Ere, fierce as autumn's sun, her lord<BR>
Send his keen arrows from the string<BR>
To drink the life-blood of our king.<BR>
This fury from thy soul dismiss,<BR>
The bane of duty, peace, and bliss.<BR>
Seek duty's path and walk therein,<BR>
And joy and endless glory win.<BR>
Restore the captive, ere we feel<BR>
The piercing point of R&aacute;ma's steel.<BR>
O spare thy city, spare the lives<BR>
Of us, our friends, our sons and wives.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spake Vibh&iacute;shan wise and brave:<BR>
The R&aacute;kshas king no answer gave,<BR>
But bade his lords the council close,<BR>
And sought his chamber for repose.<BR>
