### CANTO II.: THE PEOPLE'S SPEECH.

Then to the full assembly bowed  
The monarch, and addressed the crowd  
With gracious speech, in accents loud  
As heavenly drum or thunder-cloud:  

'Needs not to you who know declare  
How ever with paternal care  
My fathers of Ikshváku's line  
Have ruled the realm which now is mine.  
I too have taught my feet to tread  
The pathway of the mighty dead,  
And with fond care that never slept  
Have, as I could, my people kept.  
So toiling still, and ne'er remiss  
For all my people's weal and bliss,  
Beneath the white umbrella's  <span id="fr_260"></span>[1](#fn_260)
shade.  
Old age is come and strength decayed.  
Thousands of years have o'er me flown,  
And generations round me grown  
And passed away. I crave at length  
Repose and ease for broken strength.  
Feeble and worn I scarce can bear  
The ruler's toil, the judge's care,  
With royal dignity, a weight  
That tries the young and temperate.  

I long to rest, my labour done,  
And in my place to set my son,  
If to the twice-born gathered here  
My counsel wise and good appear.  
For greater gifts than mine adorn  
Ráma my son, my eldest-born.  
Like Indra brave, before him fall  
The foeman's cities, tower and wall.  
Him prince of men for power and might,  
The best maintainer of the right,  
Fair as the moon when nothing bars  
His glory close to Pushya's stars,  
Him with to-morrow's light I fain  
Would throne the consort of my reign,  
A worthy lord for you, I ween,  
Marked as her own by Fortune's Queen.  
The triple world itself would be  
Well ruled by such a king as he.  
To such high bliss and happy fate  
Will I the country dedicate,  
And my sad heart will cease to grieve  
If he the precious charge receive.  
Thus is my careful plan matured,  
Thus for myself is rest secured;  
Lieges, approve the words I say,  
Or point ye out some wiser way.  
Devise your prudent plan. My mind  
Is fondly to this thought inclined,  
But men by keen debating move  
Some middle course which all approve.'  

The monarch ceased. In answer came  
The joyous princes' glad acclaim.  
So peacocks in the rain rejoice  
And hail the cloud with lifted voice.  
Murmurs of joy from thousands round  
Shook the high palace with the sound.  
Then when the gathered throng had learned  
His will who right and gain discerned,  
Peasant and townsman, priest and chief,  
All met in consultation brief,  
And soon agreed with one accord  
Gave answer to their sovereign lord:  
'King of the land, we know thee old:  
Thousands of years have o'er thee rolled,  
Ráma thy son, we pray, anoint.  
And at thy side his place appoint  
Our gallant prince, so brave and strong,  
Riding in royal state along,  
Our eyes with joyful pride will see  
Screened by the shade that shelters thee.'  
Then spake the king again, as though  
Their hearts' true wish he sought to know:  
'These prayers for Ráma's rule suggest  
One question to my doubting breast.  
This thing, I pray, with truth explain:  
Why would ye, while I justly reign,  
That he, mine eldest son, should bear  
His part with me as ruling heir?'  
Then all the people made reply,  
Peasant and townsman, low and high:  
' Each noblest gift of form and mind,  

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>  

O Monarch, in thy son we find.  
Do thou the godlike virtues hear  
Which Ráma to our hearts endear.  
So richly blest with graces, none  
In all the earth excels thy son:  
Nay, who to match with him may claim  
In truth, in justice, and in fame?  
True to his promise, gentle, kind,  
Unenvious, of grateful mind,  
Versed in the law and firm of soul,  
He keeps each sense with strict control.  
With duteous care he loves to sit  
By Bráhmans skilled in Holy Writ.  
Hence brightest glory, ne'er to end,  
And matchless fame his youth attend.  
Skilled in the use of spear and shield.  
And arms which heavenly warriors wield,  
Supreme in war, unconquered yet  
Bv man, fiend, God in battle met,  
Whene'er in pomp of war he goes  
'Gainst town or city of the foes,  
He ever comes with Lakshman back  
Victorious from the fierce attack.  
Returning homeward from afar  
Borne on his elephant or car,  
He ever to the townsmen bends  
And greets them as beloved friends,  
Asks how each son, each servant thrives,  
How fare our pupils, offerings, wives;  
And like a father bids us tell,  
Each for himself, that all is well.  
If pain or grief the city tries  
His heart is swift to sympathize.  
When festive scenes our thoughts employ  
He like a father shares the joy.  
High is the fate, O King, that gave  
Thy Ráma born to bless and save,  
With filial virtues fair and mild  
Like Kas'yap old Maríchi's child.  
Hence to the kingdom's distant ends  
One general prayer for him ascends.  
Each man in town and country prays  
For Ráma's strength, health, length of days.  
With hearts sincere, their wish the same,  
The tender girl, the aged dame,  
Subject and stranger, peasant, hind,  
One thought impressed on every mind,  
At evening and at dawning day  
To all the Gods for Ráma pray.  
Do thou, O King, of grace comply,  
And hear the people's longing cry,  
And let us on the throne by thee  
The lotus-tinted Ráma see.  
   O thou who givest boons, attend;  
   A gracious ear, O Monarch, lend  
     And for our weal install,  
Consenting to our earnest prayer,  
Thy godlike Ráma Regent Heir,  
     Who seeks the good of all.'
