### CANTO XXXIII.: SÚRPANAKHÁ'S SPEECH.

Burning with anger, in the ring  
Of counsellors who girt their king,  
To Rávan, ravener of man,  
With bitter words she thus began:  

'Wilt thou absorbed in pleasure, still  
Pursue unchecked thy selfish will:  
Nor turn thy heedless eyes to see  
The coming fate which threatens thee?  
The king who days and hours employs  
In base pursuit of vulgar joys  
Must in his people's sight be vile  
As fire that smokes on funeral pile.  
He who when duty calls him spares  
No time for thought of royal cares,  
Must with his realm and people all  
Involved in fatal ruin fall.  
As elephants in terror shrink  
From the false river's miry brink,  
Thus subjects from a monarch flee  
Whose face their eyes may seldom see,  
Who spends the hours for toil ordained  
In evil courses unrestrained.  
He who neglects to guard and hold  
His kingdom by himself controlled,  
Sinks nameless like a hill whose head  
Is buried in the ocean's bed.  

Thy foes are calm and strong and wise,  
Fiends, Gods, and warriors of the skies,--  
How, heedless, wicked, weak, and vain,  
Wilt thou thy kingly state maintain?  
Thou, lord of giants, void of sense,  
Slave of each changing influence,  
Heedless of all that makes a king.  
Destruction on thy head wilt bring.  
O conquering chief, the prince, who boasts,  
Of treasury and rule and hosts,  
By others led, though lord of all,  
Is meaner than the lowest thrall.  
For this are monarchs said to be  
Long-sighted, having power to see  
Things far away by faithful eyes  
Of messengers and loyal spies.  
But aid from such thou wilt not seek:  
Thy counsellors are blind and weak,  
Or thou from these hadst surely known  
Thy legions and thy realm o'erthrown.  
Know, twice seven thousand, fierce in might,  
Are slain by Ráma in the fight,  
And they, the giant host who led,  
Khara and Dúshan, both are dead.  
Know, Ráma with his conquering arm  
Has freed the saints from dread of harm,  
Has smitten Janasthán and made  
Asylum safe in Dandak's shade.  
Enslaved and dull of blinded sight,  
Intoxicate with vain delight,  
Thou closest still thy heedless eyes  
To dangers in thy realm that rise.  
A king besotted, mean, unkind,  
Of niggard hand and slavish mind.  
Will find no faithful followers heed  
Their master in his hour of need.  
The friend on whom he most relies,  
In danger, from a monarch flies,  
Imperious in his high estate,  
Conceited, proud, and passionate;  
Who ne'er to state affairs attends  
With wholesome fear when woe impends  
Most weak and worthless as the grass,  
Soon from his sway the realm will pass.  
For rotting wood a use is found,  
For clods and dust that strew the ground,  
But when a king has lost his sway,  
Useless he falls, and sinks for aye.  
As raiment by another worn,  
As faded garland crushed and torn,  
So is, unthroned, the proudest king,  
Though mighty once, a useless thing.  
But he who every sense subdues  
And each event observant views,  
Rewards the good and keeps from wrong,  
Shall reign secure and flourish long.  
Though lulled in sleep his senses lie  
He watches with a ruler's eye,  
Untouched by favour, ire, and hate,  
And him the people celebrate.  
O weak of mind, without a trace  

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>  

Of virtues that a king should grace,  
Who hast not learnt from watchful spy  
That low in death the giants lie.  
Scorner of others, but enchained  
     By every base desire,  
   By thee each duty is disdained  
     Which time and place require.  
   Soon wilt thou, if thou canst not learn,  
     Ere yet it be too late,  
   The good from evil to discern,  
     Fall from thy high estate.'  
   As thus she ceased not to upbraid  
     The king with cutting speech,  
   And every fault to view displayed,  
     Naming and marking each,  
   The monarch of the sons of night,  
     Of wealth and power possessed,  
   And proud of his imperial might,  
     Long pondered in his breast.
