### CANTO LVI: MOUNT ARISHTA.

He looked upon the burning waste,  
Then sought the queen in joyous haste,  
With words of hope consoled her heart,  
And made him ready to depart.  

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>  

He sealed Arishta's glorious steep  
Whose summits beetled o'er the deep.  
The woods in varied beauty dressed  
Hung like a garland round his crest,  
And clouds of ever changing hue  
A robe about his shoulders threw.  
On him the rays of morning fell  
To wake the hill they loved so well,  
And bid unclose those splendid eyes  
That glittered in his mineral dyes.  
He woke to hear the music made  
By thunders of the white cascade,  
While every laughing rill that sprang  
From crag to crag its carol sang.  
For arms, he lifted to the stars  
His towering stems of Deodárs,  
And morning heard his pealing call  
In tumbling brook and waterfall.  
He trembled when his woods were pale  
And bowed beneath the autumn gale,  
And when his vocal reeds were stirred  
His melancholy moan was heard.  
  Far down against the mountain's feet  
The Vánar heard the wild waves beat;  
Then turned his glances to the north.  
Sprang from the peak and bounded forth,  
The mountain felt the fearful shock  
And trembled through his mass of rock.  
The tallest trees were crushed and rent  
And headlong to the valley sent,  
And as the rocking shook each cave  
Loud was the roar the lions gave.  
Forth from the shaken cavern came  
Fierce serpents with their tongues aflame;  
And every Yaksha, wild with dread,  
And Kinnar and Gandharva, fled.
