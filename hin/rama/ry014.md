### CANTO XII.: THE SACRIFICE BEGUN.

Again the spring with genial heat  
Returning made the year complete.  
To win him sons, without delay  
His vow the king resolved to pay:  
And to Vas'ishtha, saintly man,  
In modest words this speech began:  
'Prepare the rite with all things fit  
As is ordained in Holy Writ,  
And keep with utmost care afar  
Whate'er its sacred forms might mar.  
Thou art, my lord, my trustiest guide,  
Kind-hearted, and my friend beside;  
So is it meet thou undertake  
This heavy task for duty's sake.'  

Then he, of twice-born men the best,  
His glad assent at once expressed:  
'Fain will I do whate'er may be  
Desired, O honoured King, by thee.'  
To ancient priests he spoke, who, trained  
In holy rites, deep skill had gained:  
'Here guards be stationed, good and sage  
Religious men of trusted age.  
And various workmen send and call,  
Who frame the door and build the wall:  
With men of every art and trade,  
Who read the stars and ply the spade,  

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>  

And mimes and minstrels hither bring,  
And damsels trained to dance and sing.'  

Then to the learned men he said,  
In many a page of Scripture read:  
'Be yours each rite performed to see  
According to the king's decree.  
And stranger Bráhmans quickly call  
To this great rite that welcomes all.  
Pavilions for the princes, decked  
With art and ornament, erect,  
And handsome booths by thousands made  
The Bráhman visitors to shade,  
Arranged in order side by side,  
With meat and drink and all supplied.  
And ample stables we shall need  
For many an elephant and steed:  
And chambers where the men may lie,  
And vast apartments, broad and high,  
Fit to receive the countless bands  
Of warriors come from distant lands.  
For our own people too provide  
Sufficient tents, extended wide,  
And stores of meat and drink prepare,  
And all that can be needed there.  
And food in plenty must be found  
For guests from all the country round.  
Of various viands presents make,  
For honour, not for pity's sake,  
That fit regard and worship be  
Paid to each caste in due degree.  
And let not wish or wrath excite  
Your hearts the meanest guest to slight;  
But still observe with special grace  
Those who obtain the foremost place,  
Whether for happier skill in art  
Or bearing in the rite their part.  
Do you, I pray, with friendly mind  
Perform the task to you assigned,  
And work the rite, as bids the law,  
Without omission, slip, or flaw'  

They answered: 'As thou seest fit  
So will we do and naught omit.'  
The sage Vas'ishtha then addressed  
Sumantra called at his behest:  
'The princes of the earth invite,  
And famous lords who guard the rite,  
Priest, Warrior, Merchant, lowly thrall,  
In countless thousands summon all.  
Where'er their home be, far or near,  
Gather the good with honour here,  
And Janak, whose imperial sway  
The men of Míthilá  <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86) obey.  
The firm of vow, the dread of foes,  
Who all the lore of Scripture knows,  

Invite him here with honour high,  
King Das'aratha's old ally.  
And Kás'i's  <span id="fr_87"></span>[1b](#fn_87) lord of gentle
speech,  
Who finds a pleasant word for each,  
In length of days our monarch's peer,  
Illustrious king, invite him here.  
The father of our ruler's bride,  
Known for his virtues far and wide,  
The king whom Kekaya's  <span id="fr_88"></span>[2b](#fn_88) realms
obey,  
Him with his son invite, I pray.  
And Lomapád the Angas' king,  
True to his vows and godlike, bring.  
For be thine invitations sent  
To west and south and orient.  
Call those who rule Suráshtra's  <span id="fr_89"></span>[3b](#fn_89)
land,  
Suvíra's  <span id="fr_90"></span>[4b](#fn_90) realm and Sindhu's
strand,  
And all the kings of earth beside  
In friendship's bonds with us allied:  
Invite them all to hasten in  
With retinue and kith and kin.'  

Vas'ishtha's speech without delay  
Sumantra bent him to obey.  
And sent his trusty envoys forth  
Eastward and westward, south and north.  
Obedient to the saint's request  
Himself he hurried forth, and pressed  
Each nobler chief and lord and king  
To hasten to the gathering.  
Before the saint Vas'ishtha stood  
All those who wrought with stone and wood,  
And showed the work which every one  
In furtherance of the rite had done,  
Rejoiced their ready zeal to see,  
Thus to the craftsmen all said he:  
'I charge ye, masters, see to this,  
That there be nothing done amiss,  
And this, I pray, in mind be borne,  
That not one gift ye give in scorn:  
Whenever scorn a gift attends  
Great sin is his who thus offends.'  

And now some days and nights had past,  
And kings began to gather fast,  
And precious gems in liberal store  
As gifts to Das'aratha bore.  
Then joy thrilled through Vas'ishtha's breast  
As thus the monarch he addressed:  
'Obedient to thy high decree  
The kings, my lord, are come to thee.  

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>  

And it has been my care to greet  
And honour all with reverence meet.  
Thy servants' task is ended quite,  
And all is ready for the rite.  
Come forth then to the sacred ground  
Where all in order will be found.'  
Then Rishyas'ring confirmed the tale:  
Nor did their words to move him fail.  
The stars propitious influence lent  
When forth the world's great ruler went.  

Then by the sage Vas'ishtha led  
   The priest begun to speed  
Those glorious rites wherein is shed  
   The lifeblood of the steed.
