<P>
Fierce S'&uacute;rpanakh&aacute; with her train<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's dwelling came again,<BR>
And to the eager giants showed<BR>
Where S&iacute;t&aacute; and the youths abode.<BR>
Within the leafy cot they spied<BR>
The hero by his consort's side,<BR>
And faithful Lakshman ready still<BR>
To wait upon his brother's will.<BR>

Then noble R&aacute;ma raised his eye<BR>
And saw the giants standing nigh,<BR>
And then, as nearer still they pressed.<BR>
His glorious brother thus addressed,<BR>
'Be thine a while, my brother dear,<BR>
To watch o'er S&iacute;t&aacute;'s safety here,<BR>
And I will slay these creatures who<BR>
The footsteps of my spouse pursue.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He spoke, and reverent Lakshman heard<BR>
Submissive to his brother's word.<BR>
The son of Raghu, virtuous-souled,<BR>
Strung his great bow adorned with gold,<BR>
And, with the weapon in his hand,<BR>
Addressed him to the giant band:<BR>
'R&aacute;ma and Lakshman we, who spring<BR>
From Das'aratha, mighty King;<BR>
We dwell a while with S&iacute;t&aacute; here<BR>
In Dandak forest wild and drear.<BR>
On woodland roots and fruit we feed,<BR>
Aud lives of strictest rule we lead.<BR>
Say why would ye our lives oppress<BR>
Who sojourn in the wilderness.<BR>
Sent hither by the hermits' prayer<BR>
With bow and darts unused to spare,<BR>
For vengeance am I come to slay<BR>
Your sinful band in battle fray.<BR>
Rest as ye are: remain content,<BR>
Nor try the battle's dire event.<BR>
Unless your offered lives ye spurn,<BR>
O rovers of the night, return.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  They listened while the hero spoke,<BR>
Aud fury in each breast awoke.<BR>
The Br&aacute;hman-slayers raised on high<BR>
Their mighty spears and made reply:<BR>
They spoke with eyes aglow with ire,<BR>
While R&aacute;ma's burnt with vengeful tire,<BR>
Aud answered thus, in fury wild,<BR>
That peerless chief whose tones were mild:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Nay thou hast angered, overbold,<BR>
Khara our lord, the mighty-souled,<BR>
And for thy sin, in battle strife<BR>
Shalt yield to us thy forfeit life.<BR>
No power hast thou alone to stand<BR>
Against the numbers of our band.<BR>
'Twere vain to match thy single might<BR>
Against us in the front of fight.<BR>
When we equipped for fight advance<BR>
With brandished pike and mace and lance,<BR>
Thou, vanquished in the desperate field,<BR>
Thy bow, thy strength, thy life shalt yield.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With bitter words and threatening mien<BR>
Thus furious spoke the fierce fourteen,<BR>
And raising scymitar and spear<BR>
On R&aacute;ma rushed in wild career.<BR>
Their levelled spears the giant crew<BR>
Against the matchless hero threw.<BR>
His bow the son of Raghu bent,<BR>
And twice seven shafts to meet them sent,<BR>
And every javelin sundered fell<BR>
By the bright darts he aimed so well.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hero saw: his anger grew<BR>
To fury: from his side he drew<BR>
Fresh sunbright arrows pointed keen,<BR>
In number, like his foes, fourteen.<BR>
His bow he grasped, the string he drew,<BR>
And gazing on the giant crew,<BR>
As Indra casts the levin, so<BR>
Shot forth his arrrows at the foe.<BR>
The hurtling arrows, stained with gore,<BR>
Through the fiends' breasts a passage tore,<BR>
And in the earth lay buried deep<BR>
As serpents through an ant-hill creep<BR>
Like trees uptorn by stormy blast<BR>
The shattered fiends to earth were cast,<BR>
And there with mangled bodies they,<BR>
Bathed in their blood and breathless, lay.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With fainting heart and furious eye<BR>
The demon saw her champions die.<BR>
With drying wounds that scarcely bled<BR>
Back to her brother's home she fled.<BR>
Oppressed with pain, with loud lament<BR>
At Khara's feet the monster bent.<BR>
There like a plant whence slowly come<BR>
The trickling drops of oozy gum,<BR>
With her grim features pale with pain<BR>
She poured her tears in ceaseless rain,<BR>
There routed S'&uacute;rpanakh&aacute; lay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And told her brother all,<BR>
The issue of the bloody fray,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Her giant champions' fall.<BR>
