### CANTO LVII.: SÍTÁ COMFORTED.

Soon as the fiend had set her down  
Within his home in Lanká's town  
Triumph and joy filled Indra's breast,  
Whom thus the Eternal Sire addressed:  
   'This deed will free the worlds from woe  
And cause the giants' overthrow.  
The fiend has borne to Lanká's isle  
The body of the \* smile,  
True consort \* to happy fate  
W \* and dedicate

She looks and longs for Ráma's face,  
But sees a crowd of demon race,  
And guarded by the giant's train  
Pines for her lord and weeps in vain,  
But Lanká founded on a steep  
Is girdled by the mighty deep,  
And how will Ráma know his fair  
And blameless wife is prisoned there?  
She on her woe will sadly brood  
And pine away in solitude,  
And heedless of herself, will cease  
To live, despairing of release.  
Yes, pondering on her fate, I see  
Her gentle life in jeopardy.  
Go, Indra, swiftly seek the place,  
And look upon her lovely face.  
Within the city make thy way:  
Let heavenly food her spirit stay.'  
   Thus Brahma, spake: and He who slew  
The cruel demon Páka, flew  
Where Lanká's royal city lay,  
And Sleep went with him on his way.  
'Sleep,' cried the heavenly Monarch, 'close  
Each giant's eye in deep repose.'  
   Thus Indra spoke, and Sleep fulfilled  
With joy his mandate, as he willed,  
To aid the plan the Gods proposed,  
The demons' eyes in sleep she closed.  
Then Sachi's lord, the Thousand-eyed,  
To the Asoka garden hied.  
He came and stood where Sitá lay,  
And gently thus began to say:  
'Lord of the Gods who hold the sky,  
Dame of the lovely smile, am I.  
Weep no more, lady, weep no more;  
Thy days of woe will soon be o'er.  
I come, O Janak's child, to be  
The helper of thy lord and thee.  
He through my grace, with hosts to aid,  
This sea-girt land will soon invade.  
'Tis by my art that slumbers close  
The eyelids of thy giant foes.  
Now I, with Sleep, this place have sought,  
Videhau lady, and have brought  
A gift of heaven's ambrosial food  
To stay thee in thy solitude.  
Receive it from my hand, and taste,  
O lady of the dainty waist:  
For countless ages thou shall be  
From pangs of thirst and hunger free.'  
   But doubt within her bosom woke  
As to the Lord of Gods she spoke:  
'How may I know for truth that thou  
Whose form I see before me now  
Art verily the King adored  
By heavenly Gods, and S'achi's lord?  
With Rhagu's sons I learnt to know  
The certain signs which Godhead show.  
These marks before mine eyes display  
If o'er the Gods thou bear the sway.'  
   The heavenly lord of S'achi heard.  
And did according to her word,  
Above the ground his feet were raised;  
With eyelids motionless he gazed.  
No dust upon his raiment lay,  
And his bright wreath was fresh and gay.  
Nor was the lady's glad heart slow  
The Monarch of the Gods to know.  
And while the tears unceasing ran  
From her sweet eyes she thus began:  
'My lord has gained a friend in thee,  
And I this day thy presence see  
Shown clearly to mine eyes, as when  
Ráma and Lakshman, lords of men.  
Beheld it, and their sire the king,  
And Janak too from whom I spring.  
Now I, O Monarch of the Blest,  
Will eat this food at thy behest,  
Which thou hast brought me, of thy grace,  
To aid and strengthen Raghu's race.'  
   She spoke, and by his words relieved,  
The food from Indra's hand received,  
Yet ere she ate the balm he brought.  
On Lakshman and her lord she thought.  
'If my brave lord be still alive,  
If valiant Lakshman yet survive,  
May this my taste of heavenly food  
Bring health to them and bliss renewed!'  
     She ate, and that celestial food  
   Stayed hunger, thirst, and lassitude,  
     And all her strength restored.  
   Great joy her hopeful spirit stirred  
   At the glad tidings newly heard  
      Of Lakshman and her lord.  
   And Indra's heart was joyful too:  
   He bade the Maithil dame adieu,  
     His saving errand done.  
   With Sleep beside him parting thence  
   He sought his heavenly residence  
     To prosper Raghu's son.
