### CANTO LXXIV.: BHARAT'S LAMEST.

When Bharat's anger-sharpened tongue  
Reproaches on the queen had flung,  
Again, with mighty rage possessed,  
The guilty dame he thus addressed:  
'Flee, cruel, wicked sinner, flee,  
Let not this kingdom harbour thee.  
Thou who hast thrown all right aside,  
Ween thou for me when I have died.  
Canst thou one charge against the king,  
Or the most duteous Ráma bring?  
The one thy sin to death has sent,  
The other chased to banishment.  
Our line's destroyer, sin defiled  
Like one who kills an unborn child,  
Ne'er with thy lord in heaven to dwell,  
Thy portion shall be down in hell  
Because thy hand, that stayed for naught,  
This awful wickedness has wrought,  
And ruined him whom all held dear,  
My bosom too is stirred with fear.  
My father by thy sin is dead,  
And Ráma to the wood is fled;  
And of thy deed I bear the stain,  
And fameless in the world remain.  
Ambitious, evil-souled. in show  
My mother, yet my direst foe.  
My throning ne'er thine eyes shall bless,  
Thy husband's wicked murderess.

Thou art not As'vapati's child,  
That righteous king most sage and mild,  
But thou wast born a fiend, a foe  
My father's house to overthrow.  
Thou who hast made Kaus'alyá, pure,  
Gentle, affectionate, endure  
The loss of him who was her bliss--  
What worlds await thee, Queen, for this?  
Was it not patent to thy sense  
That Ráma was his friends' defence,  
Kaus'alyá's own true child most dear,  
The eldest and his father's peer?  
Men in the son not only trace  
The father's figure, form, and face,  
But in his heart they also find  
The offspring of the father's mind;  
And hence, though dear their kinsmen are,  
To mothers sons are dearer far.  
There goes an ancient legend how  
Good Surabhi, the God-loved cow,  
Saw two of her dear children strain,  
Drawing a plough and faint with pain.  
She saw them on the earth outworn,  
Toiling till noon from early morn,  
And as she viewed her children's woe,  
A flood of tears began to flow.  
As through the air beneath her swept  
The Lord of Gods, the drops she wept,  
Fine, laden with delicious smell,  
Upon his heavenly body fell,  
And Indra lifted up his eyes  
And saw her standing in the skies,  
Afflicted with her sorrow's weight,  
Sad, weeping, all disconsolate.  
The Lord of Gods in anxious mood  
Thus spoke in suppliant attitude:  
'No fear disturbs our rest, and how  
Comes this great dread upon thee now?  
Whence can this woe upon thee fall,  
Say, gentle one who lovest all?'  

Thus spake the God who rules the skies,  
Indra, the Lord supremely wise;  
And gentle Surabhi, well learned  
In eloquence, this speech returned:  
'Not thine the fault, great God, not thine  
And guiltless are the Lords divine:  
I mourn two children faint with toil,  
Labouring hard in stubborn soil,  
Wasted and sad I see them now,  
While the sun beats on neck and brow,  
Still goaded by the cruel hind,--  
No pity in his savage mind.  
O Indra, from this body sprang  
These children, worn with many a pang.  
For this sad sight I mourn, for none  
Is to the mother like her son.'  

He saw her weep whose offspring feed  
In thousands over hill and mead,  
And knew that in a mother's eye  
Naught with a son, for love, can vie.  
He deemed her, when the tears that came  
From her sad eyes bedewed his frame,  
Laden with their celestial scent,  
Of living things most excellent,  
If she these tears of sorrow shed  
Who many a thousand children bred,  
Think what a life of woe is left  
Kaus'alyá, of her Ráma reft.  
An only son was hers and she  
Is rendered childless now by thee.  
Here and hereafter, for thy crime,  
Woe is thy lot through endless time.  
And now, O Queen, without delay,  
With all due honour will I pay  
Both to my brother and my sire  
The rites their several fates require.  
Back to Ayodhyá will I bring  
The long-armed chief, her lord and king,  
And to the wood myself betake  
Where hermit saints their dwelling make.  
For, sinner both in deed and thought!  
This hideous crime which thou hast wrought  
I cannot bear, or live to see  
The people's sad eyes bent on me.  
Begone, to Dandak wood retire,  
Or cast thy body to the fire,  
Or bind around thy neck the rope:  
No other refuge mayst thou hope.  
When Ráma, lord of valour true,  
Has gained the earth, his right and due,  
Then, free from duty's binding debt,  
My vanished sin shall I forget.'  

Thus like an elephant forced to brook  
The goading of the driver's hook,  
Quick panting like a serpent maimed,  
He fell to earth with rage inflamed.
