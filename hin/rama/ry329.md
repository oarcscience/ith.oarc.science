### CANTO LVI:

These Vánar hosts with one accord  
Will quit thee for their lawful lord,  
And turn again with thirsty eyes  
To wife and babe and all they prize.  
Thou in the lonely cavern left  
Of followers and friends bereft,  
Wilt be in all thy woe, alas,  
Weak as a blade of trembling grass:  
And Lakshman's arrows, keen and fierce  
From his strong bow, thy heart will pierce.  
But if in lowly reverence meek  
Sugríva's court with us thou seek,  
He, as thy birth demands, will share  
The kingdom with the royal heir.  
Thy loving kinsman, true and wise,  
Looks on thee still with favouring eyes.  
Firm in his promise, pure is he,  
And ne'er will vex or injure thee.  
He loves thy mother, lives for her  
A faithful friend and worshipper.  
That mother's love thou mayst not spurn:  
Her only child, return, return.'
