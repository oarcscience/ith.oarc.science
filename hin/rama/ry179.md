### CANTO CI.: BHARAT QUESTIONED.

Then Rama gazed, and scarcely knew  
Bharat so worn and changed in hue.  
He raised him, kissed him on the head,  
Embraced him, and thus kindly said;  
'Where was thy father, brother dear,  
That thou art come to seek me here?  
Unmeet, if he be living yet,  
Thy feet within the wood to set.  
I pray thee now the cause declare  
Why thou hast left the kingdom there,  
With matted locks and deerskin dress  
To roam the distant wilderness.'  

Thus questioned by the prince, at length  
Kaikeyi's son regained his strength,  
And hand to hand in reverence laid,  
To Rama thus his answer made:  
'The great-armed monarch, O my lard,  
Has dared to do a thing abhorred,  
Left us, and grieving for his son,  
A home among the Gods has won.  

My mother Queen Kaikeyf gave  
The order to the king her slave,  
And at the bidding of the dame  
He wrought the sin which mars his fame.  
Athirst for sway, her hopes are crossed,  
She mourns her son, her husband lost,  
And through her impious crime will go  
For punishment to hell below.  
Now O my lord, forgive me all;  
Be gracious to thy lowly thrall:  
Anointed king, accept to-day  
Like Iudra's self, the royal sway.  
Be gracious, Prince, to lord and peer,  
And widowed queens who seek thee here  
Accept the kingdom thine by right.  
And so thy faithful friends delight.  
Let the broad land no longer be  
All widowed and forlorn of thee:  
Let the full moon of autumn reign  
Triumphant o'er the night again.  
These lords and I before thee bend:  
O Rama, to Our prayer attend.  
O do not thou this grace deny:  
Thy brother, pupil, slave am I.  
Look on this venerable ring,  
Advisers of our sire the king.  
From age to age so honoured: thou  
Shouldst grant their supplication now?  
   As weeping thus the hero prayed,  
His head at Rama's feet he laid.  
Like a mad elephant he sighed:  
And Rama, gazed and thus replied:  
'How, brother, Can a man of worth,  
True to his vows, of noble birth-  
A man like me, commit a sin  
The lordship of the land to win?  
No slightest shade of fault I see,  
O tamer of thy foes, in thee.  
But ne'er shouldst thou in childish thought  
The queen thy mother blame in aught,  
O brother wise and sinless, know  
The sacred laws would have it so,  
That from good wife and son require  
Obedience to their lord and sire.  
And we are all the king's, for thus  
The virtuous ever reckon us:  
Yea brother, be it known to thee,  
His wives, and sons, and pupils we.  
His is the right, if he deem fit,  
To bid me, throned as monarch, sit,  
Or in a coat of bark expel,  
And deerskin, in the wood to dwell.  
And O remember, best of all  
Who act as claims of duty call,  
As to a virtuous sire is due,  
Such honour claims a mother too.  
So they whose lives have ever been  
By duty led, the king and queen,  
Said,'Rama, seek the forest shade:'  
And I (what could I else?) obeyed.  
Thou must the royal power retain,  

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>  

And o'er the famed Ayodhyá reign:  
I dressed in bark my days will spent  
Where Dandak'a forest wilds extend.  
So Das'aratha spoke, our king,  
His share to each apportioning  
Before his honoured servants, eyes:  
Then, heir of bliss, he sought the skies.  
The righteous monarch's honoured will,  
Whom all revered, must guide thee still,  
And thou must still enjoy the share  
Assigned thee by our father's care.  
So I till twice seven years are spent  
Will roam this wood in banishment,  
Contented with the lot which he,  
My high-souled sire, has given me.  
The charge the monarch gave, endeared  
To all mankind, by all revered,  
   Peer of the Lord Supreme,  
Far better, richer far in gain  
Of every blessing than to reign  
   O'er all the worlds I deem.'
