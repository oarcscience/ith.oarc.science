### CANTO CVI.: GLORY TO THE SUN.

There faint and bleeding fast, apart  
Stood Rávan raging in his heart.  
Then, moved with ruth for Ráma's sake,  
Agastya  <span id="fr_1021"></span>[2b](#fn_1021.md) came and gently
spake:  
'Bend, Ráma, bend thy heart and ear  
The everlasting truth to hear  
Which all thy hopes through life will bless  
And crown thine arms with full success.  
The rising sun with golden rays,  
Light of the worlds, adore and praise:  
The universal king, the lord  
By hosts of heaven and fiends adored.  
He tempers all with soft control.  
He is the Gods' diviner soul;  
And Gods above and fiends below  
And men to him their safety owe.  
He Brahmá, Vishnu, S'iva, he  
Each person of the glorious Three,  
Is every God whose praise \*?? tell,  
The King of Heaven,  <span id="fr_1022"></span>[3b](#fn_1022.md) the Lord
of Hell:  <span id="fr_1023"></span>[4b](#fn_1023.md)  
Each God revered from times of old,  
The Lord of War,  <span id="fr_1024"></span>[5b](#fn_1024.md) the King of
Gold:  <span id="fr_1025"></span>[6b](#fn_1025.md)  

<span id="page_492">p. 492</span>  

Mahendra, Time and Death is he,  <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[1](#fn_1026.md)  
The Moon, the Ruler of the Sea.  
He hears our praise in every form,--  
The manes,  <span id="fr_1027"></span>[2](#fn_1027.md) Gods who ride the
storm,  <span id="fr_1028"></span>[3](#fn_1028.md)  
The As'vins,  <span id="fr_1029"></span>[4](#fn_1029.md) Manu,  <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[5](#fn_1030.md) they who stand  
Round Indra,  <span id="fr_1031"></span>[6](#fn_1031.md) and the Sádhyas'
 <span id="fr_1032"></span>[7](#fn_1032.md) band  
He is the air, and life and fire,  
The universal source and sire:  
He brings the seasons at his call,  
Creator, light, and nurse of all.  
His heavenly course he joys to run,  
Maker of Day, the golden sun.  
The steeds that whirl his car are seven,  <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[8](#fn_1033.md)  
The flaming steeds that flash through heaven.  
Lord of the sky, the conqueror parts  
The clouds of night with glistering darts.  
He, master of the Vedas' lore,  
Commands the clouds' collected store:  
He is the rivers' surest friend;  
He bids the rains, and they descend.  
Stars, planets, constellations own  
Their monarch of the golden throne.  
Lord of twelve forms,  <span id="fr_1034"></span>[9](#fn_1034.md) to thee I
bow,  
Most glorious King of heaven art thou.  
O Ráma, he who pays aright  
Due worship to the Lord of Light  
Shall never fall oppressed by ill,  
But find a stay and comfort still.  
Adore with all thy heart and mind  
This God of Gods, to him resigned;  
And thou his saving power shalt know  
Victorious o'er thy giant foe.  <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[10](#fn_1035.md)

saint who has on former occasions assisted Ráma with his gifts and
counsel.

<span id="fn_1022"></span>[491:3b](ry478.htm#fr_1022.md) Indra.

forefathers or spirits of the dead, are of two kinds, either the spirits

<span id="fn_1028"></span>[492:3](ry478.htm#fr_1028.md) The Maruts or
Storm-Gods.

<span id="fn_1029"></span>[492:4](ry478.htm#fr_1029.md) The Heavenly Twins,
the Castor and Pollux of the Hindus.

<span id="fn_1030"></span>[492:5](ry478.htm#fr_1030.md) The Man *par

in the year.

<span id="fn_1035"></span>[492:10](ry478.htm#fr_1035.md) This Canto does
not appear in the Bengal recension. It comes in awkwardly and may I
think be considered as an interpolation, but I paraphrase a portion of
it as a relief after so much fighting and carnage, and as an interesting
glimpse of the monotheistic ideas which underlie the Hindu religion. The
hymn does not readily lend itself to metrical translation, and I have
not attempted here to give a faithful rendering of the whole. A literal
version of the text and the commentary given in the Calcutta edition
will be found in the Additional Notes.

A canto is here omitted. It contains fighting of the ordinary kind
between Ráma and Rávan, and a description of sights and sounds of evil
omen foreboding the destruction of the giant.
