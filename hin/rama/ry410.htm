<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XI.: THE SUMMONS.</H3>
<P>
Still R&aacute;van's haughty heart rebelled.<BR>
The counsel of the wise repelled,<BR>
And, as his breast with passion burned,<BR>
His thoughts again to Sit&aacute; turned.<BR>
Thus, to each sign of danger blind,<BR>
To love and war he still inclined.<BR>
Then mounted he his car that glowed<BR>
With gems and golden net, and rode<BR>
Where, gathered at the monarch's call,<BR>
The nobles filled the council hall.<BR>
A host of warriors bright and gay<BR>
With coloured robes and rich array,<BR>
With shield and mace and spear and sword,<BR>
Followed the chariot of their lord<BR>
Mid the loud voice of shells and beat<BR>
Of drums he raced along the street,<BR>
And, ere he came, was heard afar<BR>
The rolling thunder of his car.<BR>
He reached the doors: the nobles bent<BR>
Their heads before him reverent:<BR>
And, welcomed with their loud acclaim,<BR>
Within the glorious hall he came.<BR>
He sat upon a royal seat<BR>
With golden steps beneath his feet,<BR>
And bade the heralds summon all<BR>
His captains to the council hall.<BR>
The heralds heard the words he spake,<BR>
And sped from house to house to wake<BR>
The giants where they slept or spent<BR>
The careless hours in merriment.<BR>
These heard the summons and obeyed:<BR>
From chamber, grove, and colonnade,<BR>
On elephants or cars they rode,<BR>
Or through the streets impatient strode.<BR>
As birds on rustling pinions fly<BR>
Through regions of the darkened sky,<BR>
Thus cars and mettled coursers through<BR>
The crowded streets of Lank&aacute; flew.<BR>
The council hall was reached, and then,<BR>
As lions seek their mountain den.<BR>
Through massy doors that opened wide,<BR>
With martial stalk the captains hied.<BR>
Welcomed with honour as was meet<BR>
They stooped to press their monarch's feet,<BR>

And each a place in order found<BR>
On stool, on cushion, or the ground.<BR>
Nor did the sage Vibhishan long<BR>
Delay to join the noble throng.<BR>
High on a car that shone like flame<BR>
With gold and flashing gems he came,<BR>
Drew near and spoke his name aloud,<BR>
And reverent to his brother bowed.<BR>
