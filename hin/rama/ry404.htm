<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO V.: R&Aacute;MA'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
There on the coast in long array<BR>
The V&aacute;nars' marshalled legions lay,<BR>
Where N&iacute;la's care had ordered well<BR>
The watch of guard and sentinel,<BR>
And Mainda moved from post to post<BR>
With Dwivid to protect the host.<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma stood by Lakshman's side.<BR>
And mastered by his sorrow cried:<BR>
'My brother dear, the heart's distress,<BR>
As days wear on, grows less and less.<BR>
But my deep-seated grief, alas,<BR>
Grows fiercer as the seasons pass.<BR>
Though for my queen my spirit longs,<BR>
And broods indignant o'er my wrongs,<BR>
Still wilder is my grief to know<BR>
That her young life is passed in woe.<BR>
Breathe, gentle gale, O breathe where she<BR>
Lies prisoned, and then breathe on me,<BR>

<P>

<P>
And, though my love I may not meet,<BR>
Thy kiss shall be divinely sweet.<BR>
Ah, by the giant's shape appalled,<BR>
On her dear lord for help she called,<BR>
Still in mine ears the sad cry rings<BR>
And tears my heart with poison stings.<BR>
Through the long daylight and the gloom<BR>
Of night wild thoughts of her consume<BR>
My spirit, and my love supplies<BR>
The torturing flame which never dies.<BR>
Leave me, my brother; I will sleep<BR>
Couched on the bosom of the deep.<BR>
For the cold wave may bring me peace<BR>
And bid the fire of passion cease.<BR>
One only thought my stay must be,<BR>
That earth, one earth, holds her and me,<BR>
To hear, to know my darling lives<BR>
Some life-supporting comfort gives,<BR>
As streams from distant fountains run<BR>
O'er meadows parching in the sun.<BR>
Ah when, my foeman at my feet,<BR>
Shall I my queen, my glory, meet,<BR>
The blossom of her dear face raise<BR>
And on her eyes enraptured gaze,<BR>
Press her soft lips to mine again,<BR>
And drink a balm to banish pain!<BR>
Alas, alas! where lies she now,<BR>
My darling of the lovely brow?<BR>
On the cold earth, no help at hand,<BR>
Forlorn amid the R&aacute;kshas band,<BR>
King Janak's child still calls on me,<BR>
Her lord and love, to set her free.<BR>
But soon in glory will she rise<BR>
A crescent moon in autumn skies,<BR>
And those dark rovers of the night.<BR>
Like scattered clouds shall turn in flight.'<BR>
