He ceased: and King Sugriva cried<BR>
To sage Han&uacute;m&aacute;n &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_644"></A><A HREF="#fn_644"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> by his side:<BR>
'Summon the V&aacute;nar legions, those<BR>
Who dwell about the Lord of Snows:<BR>
Those who in Vindhyan groves delight,<BR>
Kail&aacute;sa's, or Mahendra's height,<BR>
Dwell on the Five bright Peaks, or where<BR>
Mandar's white summit cleaves the air:<BR>

<P>

<P>
Wherever they are wandring free<BR>
In highlands by the western sea,<BR>
On that east hill whence springs the sun,<BR>
Or where he sinks when day is done.<BR>
Call the great chiefs whose legions till<BR>
The forests of the Lotus Hill, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_645"></A><A HREF="#fn_645"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Where every one in strength and size<BR>
With the stupendous Anjan &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_646"></A><A HREF="#fn_646"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> vies.<BR>
Call those, with tints ot burnished gold<BR>
Whom Mah&aacute;s'aila's caverns hold:<BR>
Those who on Dh&uacute;nira roam, or hide<BR>
In the wild woods on Meru's side.<BR>
Call those who, brilliant as the sun,<BR>
On high Mah&aacute;run leap and run,<BR>
Quaffing sweet juices that distil<BR>
From odorous trees upon the hill,<BR>
Call those whom tranquil haunts delight<BR>
Where dwell the sage and anchorite<BR>
In groves that through their wide extent<BR>
Exhale a thousand blossoms' scent.<BR>
Send out, send out: from coast to coast<BR>
Assemble all the V&aacute;nar host:<BR>
With force, with words, with gifts of price<BR>
Compel, admonish and entice.<BR>
Already envoys have been sent<BR>
To warn them of their lord's intent.<BR>
Let others urged by thee repeat<BR>
My mandate that their steps be fleet.<BR>
Those lords who yielding to the sway<BR>
Of love's delight would fain delay,<BR>
Urge hither with the utmost speed,<BR>
Or with thee to my presence lead:<BR>
And those who linger to the last<BR>
Until ten days be come and passed,<BR>
And dare their sovereign to defy.<BR>
For their offence shall surely die.<BR>
Thousands, yea millions, shall there be,<BR>
Obedient to their king's decree,<BR>
The lions of the V&aacute;nar race,<BR>
Assembled from each distant place.<BR>
Forth shall they haste like hills in size,<BR>
Or mighty clouds that veil the skies,<BR>
And swiftly speeding on their way<BR>
Bring all our legions in array.'<BR>

He ceased: the son of V&aacute;yu &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_647"></A><A HREF="#fn_647"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> heard,<BR>
Submissive to his sovereign's word;<BR>
And sent his rapid envoys forth<BR>
To east and west and south and north.<BR>
They bent their airy course afar<BR>
Along the paths of bird and star,<BR>
And sped through ether farther yet<BR>
Where Vishnu's splendid sphere is set.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_648"></A><A HREF="#fn_648"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
By sea, on hill, by wood and lake<BR>
They called to arms for R&aacute;ma's sake,<BR>
As each with terror in his breast<BR>
Obeyed his awful king's behest.<BR>
Three million V&aacute;nars, fierce and strong<BR>
As Anjan's self, a wondrous throng.<BR>
Sped from the spot where R&aacute;ma still<BR>
Gazed restless from the woody hill.<BR>
Ten million others, brave and bold,<BR>
With coats that shone like burning gold,<BR>
Came flying from the mountain crest<BR>
Where sinks the weary sun to rest.<BR>
Impetuous from the northern skies,<BR>
Wnere Mount Kail&aacute;sa's summits rise,<BR>
Ten hundred millions hasted, hued<BR>
Like manes of lions, ne'er subdued:<BR>
The dwellers on Him&aacute;laya's side,<BR>
Whose food his roots and fruit supplied,<BR>
With rangers of the Vindhyan chain<BR>
And neighbours of the Milky Main. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_649"></A><A HREF="#fn_649"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
Some from the palm groves where they fed,<BR>
Some from the woods of betel sped:<BR>
In countless numbers, fierce and brave,<BR>
They came from mountain, lake, and cave.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As on their way the V&aacute;nars went<BR>
To rouse each distant armament,<BR>
They chanced that wondrous tree to view<BR>
That on Him&aacute;laya's summit grew.<BR>
Of old upon that sacred height<BR>
Was wrought Mahes'var's &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_650"></A><A HREF="#fn_650"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> glorious rite,<BR>
Which every God in heaven beheld,<BR>
And his glad heart with triumph swelled.<BR>
There from pure seed at random sown<BR>
Bright plants with luscious fruit had grown,<BR>
And, sweet as Amrit to the taste,<BR>
The summit of the mountain graced.<BR>
Who once should eat the virtuous fruit<BR>
That sprang from so divine a root,<BR>
One whole revolving moon should be<BR>
From every pang of hunger free.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
The V&aacute;nars culled the fruit they found<BR>
Ripe on the sacrificial ground<BR>
With rare celestial odours sweet,<BR>
To lay them at Sugr&iacute;va's feet.<BR>
Those noble envoys scoured the land<BR>
To summon every V&aacute;nar band<BR>
Then swiftly homeward at the head<BR>
Of countless armaments they sped.<BR>
They gathered by Kishkindh&aacute;'s wall.<BR>
They thronged Sugr&iacute;va's palace hall,<BR>
And, richly laden, bare within<BR>
That fruit of heavenly origin.<BR>
Their gifts before their king they spread,<BR>
And thus in tones of triumph said:<BR>
'Through every land our way we took<BR>
To visit hill and wood and brook,<BR>
And all thy hosts from east to west<BR>
Flock hither at their lord's behest.'<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va with delighted look<BR>
The present of his envoys took.<BR>
Then bade them go, with gracious speech<BR>
Rewarding and dismissing each.<BR>
