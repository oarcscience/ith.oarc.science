<P>
Then R&aacute;ma, following still his guide,<BR>
Within the grove, with Lakshman, hied.<BR>
Her vows a wondrous light had lent<BR>
To that illustrious penitent.<BR>
He saw the glorious lady, screened<BR>
From eye of man, and God, and fiend,<BR>
Like some bright portent which the care<BR>
Of Brahm&aacute; launches through the air,<BR>
Designed by his illusive art<BR>
To flash a moment and depart:<BR>
Or like the flame that leaps on high<BR>
To sink involved in smoke and die:<BR>


<P>


<P>
Or like the full moon shining through<BR>
The wintry mist, then lost to view:<BR>
Or like the sun's reflection, cast<BR>
Upon the flood, too bright to last:<BR>
So was the glorious dame till then<BR>
Removed from Gods' and mortals' ken,<BR>
Till--such was Gautam's high decree--<BR>
Prince R&aacute;ma came to set her free.<BR>

<P>
Then, with great joy that dame to meet,<BR>
The sons of Raghu clapped her feet;<BR>
And she, remembering Gautam's oath,<BR>
With gentle grace received them both;<BR>
Then water for their feet she gave,<BR>
Guest-gift, and all that strangers crave.<BR>

<P>
The prince, of courteous rule aware,<BR>
Received, as meet, the lady's care.<BR>
Then flowers came down in copious rain,<BR>
And moving to the heavenly strain<BR>
Of music in the skies that rang.<BR>
The nymphs and minstrels danced and sang:<BR>
And all the Gods with one glad voice<BR>
Praised the great dame, and cried, 'Rejoice!<BR>
Through fervid rites no more defiled,<BR>
But with thy husband reconciled.'<BR>
Gautam, the holy hermit knew--<BR>
For naught escaped his godlike view--<BR>
That R&aacute;ma lodged beneath that shade,<BR>
And hasting there his homage paid.<BR>
He took Ahaly&aacute; to his side.<BR>
From sin and folly purified,<BR>
And let his new-found consort bear<BR>
In his austerities a share.<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma, pride of Raghu's race,<BR>
Welcomed by Gautam, face to face,<BR>
Who every highest honour showed,<BR>
To Mithil&aacute; pursued his road.<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_218"></A><A HREF="ry048.htm#fr_218">61:1</A>  Kumarila says:' In the same manner,
if it is said that Indra was the seducer of
Ahaly&aacute; this does not imply that the God
Indra committed such a crime, but Indra
means the sun, and Ahaly&aacute; (from ahan
and l&iacute;) the night; and as the night is
seduced and ruined by the sun of the
morning, therefore is Indra called the
paramour of Ahaly&aacute;.' MAX MULLER,
