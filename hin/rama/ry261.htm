<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXIII.: R&Aacute;MA'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
Thus for his wife in vain he sought:<BR>
Then, his sad soul with pain distraught,<BR>
The hero of the lotus eyes<BR>
Filled all the air with frantic cries.<BR>
O'erpowered by love's strong influence, he<BR>
His absent wife still seemed to see,<BR>
And thus with accents weak and faint<BR>
Renewed with tears his wild complaint:<BR>
'Thou,fairer than their bloom, my spouse,<BR>
Art hidden by As'oka boughs.<BR>
Those blooms have power to banish care,<BR>
But now they drive me to despair.<BR>
Thine arms are like the plantain's stem:<BR>
Why let the plantain cover them?<BR>
Thou art not hidden, love; thy feet<BR>
betray thee in thy dark retreat.<BR>
Thou runnest in thy girlish sport<BR>
To flowery trees, thy dear resort.<BR>
But cease, O cease, my love, I pray,<BR>
To vex me with thy cruel play.<BR>
Such mockery in a holy spot<BR>
Where hermits dwell beseems thee not.<BR>
Ah, now I see thy fickle mind<BR>
To scornful mood too much inclined,<BR>
Come, large-eyed beauty. I implore;<BR>
Lone is the cot so dear before.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  No, she is slain by giants; they<BR>
Have stolen or devoured their prey,<BR>
Or surely at my mournful cry<BR>
My darling to her lord would fly.<BR>
O Lakshman, see those troops of deer:<BR>
In each sad eye there gleams a tear.<BR>
Those looks of woe too clearly say<BR>
My consort is the giants' prey.<BR>
O noblest, fairest of the fair,<BR>
Where art thou. best of women, where?<BR>
This day will dark Kaikey&iacute; find<BR>
Fresh triumph for her evil mind,<BR>
When I, who with my S&iacute;t&aacute; came<BR>
Return alone, without my dame.<BR>
But ne'er can I return to see<BR>
Those chambers where my queen should be<BR>
And hear the scornful people speak<BR>

Of R&aacute;ma as a coward weak.<BR>
For mine will be the coward's shame<BR>
Who let the foeman steal his dame.<BR>
How can I seek my home, or brook<BR>
Upon Videha's king to look?<BR>
How listen, when he bids me tell,<BR>
My wanderings o'er, that all is well?<BR>
He, when I meet his eager view,<BR>
Will mark that S&iacute;t&aacute; comes not too,<BR>
And when he hears the mournful tale<BR>
His wildered sense will reel and fail.<BR>
'O Das'aratha.' will he cry,<BR>
'Blest in thy mansion in the sky!'<BR>
Ne'er to that town my steps shall bend,<BR>
That town which Bharat's arms defend,<BR>
For e'en the blessed homes above<BR>
Would seem a waste without my love.<BR>
Leave me, my brother, here, I pray;<BR>
To fair Ayodhy&aacute; bend thy way.<BR>
Without my love I cannot bear<BR>
To live one hour in blank despair.<BR>
Round Bharat's neck thy fond arms twine,<BR>
And greet him with these words of mine:<BR>
'Dear brother, still the power retain,<BR>
And o'er the land as monarch reign.'<BR>
With salutation next incline<BR>
Before thy mother, his, and mine.<BR>
Still, brother, to my words attend,<BR>
And with all care each dame befriend.<BR>
To my dear mother's ear relate<BR>
My mournful tale and S&iacute;t&aacute;'s fate.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus R&aacute;ma gave his sorrow vent,<BR>
And from a heart which anguish rent,<BR>
Mourned for his wife in loud lament,-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Her of the glorious hair,<BR>
From Lakshman's cheek the colour fled,<BR>
And o'er his heart came sudden dread,<BR>
Sick, faint, and sore disquieted<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By woe too great to bear.<BR>
