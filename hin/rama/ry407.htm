<P>
Dark as a cloud of autumn, dread<BR>
Prahasta joined his palms and said:<BR>

<P>
'Gandharvas, Gods, the hosts who dwell<BR>
In heaven, in air, in earth, in hell,<BR>
Have yielded to thy might, and how<BR>
Shall two weak men oppose thee now?<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n came, a foe disguised,<BR>
And mocked us heedless and surprised,<BR>
Or never had he lived to flee<BR>
And boast that he has fought with me.<BR>
Command, O King, and this right hand<BR>
Shall sweep the V&aacute;nars from the land,<BR>
And hill and dale, to Ocean's shore,<BR>
Shall know the death-doomed race no more.<BR>
But let my care the means devise<BR>
To guard thy city from surprise.'<BR>

<P>
Then Durmukh cried, of R&aacute;kshas race:<BR>
'Too long we brook the dire disgrace.<BR>
He gave our city to the flames,<BR>
He trod the chambers of thy dames.<BR>
Ne'er shall so weak and vile a thing<BR>
Unpunished brave the giants' king.<BR>
Now shall this single arm attack<BR>
And drive the daring V&aacute;nars back,<BR>
Till to the winds of heaven they flee,<BR>
Or seek the depths of earth and sea.'<BR>

<P>
Then, brandishing the mace he bore,<BR>
Whose horrid spikes were stained with gore,<BR>
While fury made his eyeballs red,<BR>
Impetuous Vajradanshtra said:<BR>

<P>
'Why waste a thought on one so vile<BR>
As Han&uacute;m&aacute;n the V&aacute;nar, while<BR>
Sugriva, Lakshman, yet remain,<BR>
And R&aacute;ma mightier still, unslain?<BR>
This mace to-day shall crush the three,<BR>
And all the host will turn and flee.<BR>
Listen, and I will speak: incline,<BR>
O King, to hear these words of mine,<BR>
For the deep plan that I propose<BR>
Will swiftly rid thee of thy foes.<BR>
Let thousands of thy host assume<BR>
The forms of men in youthful bloom,<BR>
In war's magnificent array<BR>
Draw near to Raghu's son, and say:<BR>
'Thy younger brother Bharat sends<BR>
This army, and thy cause befriends.'<BR>
Then let our legions hasten near<BR>
With bow and mace and sword and spear,<BR>
And on the V&aacute;nar army rain<BR>
Our steel and stone till all be slain.<BR>
If Raghu's sons will fain believe,<BR>
Entangled in the net we weave,<BR>
The penalty they both must pay,<BR>
And lose their forfeit lives to-day.'<BR>

<P>
Then with his warrior soul on fire,<BR>
Nikumbha spoke in burning ire:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'I, only I, will take the field,<BR>
And Ragha's son his life shall yield.<BR>
Within these walls, O Chiefs, abide,<BR>
Nor part ye from our monarch's side.'<BR>
