<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XIX.: S&Iacute;TA'S FEAR.</H3>
<P>
Then o'er the lady's soul and frame<BR>
A sudden fear and trembling came,<BR>
When, glowing in his youthful pride,<BR>
She saw the monarch by her side.<BR>
Silent she sat, her eyes depressed,<BR>
Her soft arms folded o'er her breast,<BR>
And,--all she could,--her beauties screened<BR>
From the bold gazes of the fiend.<BR>
There where the wild she-demons kept<BR>
Their watch around, she sighed and wept.<BR>
Then, like a severed bough, she lay<BR>
Prone on the bare earth in dismay.<BR>
The while her thoughts on love's fleet wings<BR>
Flew to her lord the best of kings.<BR>
She fell upon the ground, and there<BR>
Lay struggling with her wild despair,<BR>
Sad as a lady born again<BR>
To misery and woe and pain,<BR>
Now doomed to grief and low estate,<BR>
Once noble fair and delicate:<BR>
Like faded light of holy lore,<BR>
Like Hope when all her dreams are o'er;<BR>
Like ruined power and rank debased,<BR>
Like majesty of kings disgraced:<BR>
Like woman *** led by erring slips,<BR>
The moon that labors in eclipse<BR>
A pool with all her lillies* dead<BR>
An army when its king has fled:<BR>
So sad and helpless wan and worn,<BR>
She lay among the fiends forlorn.<BR>
