<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XC.: THE HERMITAGE.</H3>
<P>
The prince of men a league away<BR>
Saw where the hermit's dwelling lay,<BR>
Then with his lords his path pursued,<BR>
And left his warrior multitude.<BR>
On foot, as duty taught his mind,<BR>
He left his warlike gear behind:<BR>
Two robes of linen cloth he wore,<BR>
And bade Vas'ishtha walk before.<BR>
Then Bharat from his lords withdrew<BR>
When Bharadv&aacute;ja came in view,<BR>
And toward the holy hermit went<BR>
Behind Vas'ishtha, reverent.<BR>
When Bharadv&aacute;ja, saint austere,<BR>
Saw good Vis'ishtha drawing near,<BR>
He cried, upspringing from his seat,<BR>
'The grace-gift bring, my friend to greet.'<BR>
When Saint Vas'ishtha near him drew,<BR>
And Bharat paid the reverence due,<BR>
The glorious hermit was aware<BR>
That Das'aratha's son was there.<BR>
The grace-gift, water for their feet<BR>
He gave, and offered fruit to eat;<BR>
Then, duty-skilled, with friendly speech<BR>
In seemly order questioned each:<BR>
'How fares it in Ayodhv&aacute; now<BR>
With treasury and army? how<BR>
With kith and kin and friends most dear,<BR>
With councillor, and prince, and peer?'<BR>
But, for be knew the king was dead,<BR>
Of Das'aratha naught he said.<BR>
Vas'ishtha and the prince in turn<BR>
Would of the hermits welfare learn:<BR>
Of holy fires they fain would hear,<BR>
Of pupils, trees, and birds, and deer.<BR>
The glorious saint his answer made<BR>
That all was well in holy shade:<BR>
Then love of R&aacute;ma moved his breast,<BR>
And thus he questioned of his guest:<BR>
Why art thou here, O Prince, whose band<BR>
With kingly sway protects the land;<BR>
Declare the cause, explain the whole.<BR>
For yet some doubt disturbs my soul.<BR>
He whom Kaus'aly&aacute; bare, whose might<BR>
The foemen slays, his line's delight,<BR>
He who with wife and brother sent<BR>
Afar now roam in banishment.<BR>
Famed prince, to whom his father spake<BR>
This order for a woman's sake:<BR>
'Away! and in the forest spend<BR>
Thy life till fourteen years shall end'--<BR>
Has thou the wish to harm him, bent<BR>
On sin against the innocent?<BR>
Wouldst thou thine elder's realm enjoy<BR>
Without a thorn that can annoy?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With sobbing voice and tearful eye<BR>
Thus Bharat sadly made reply:<BR>
'Ah lost am I, if thou, O Saint,<BR>

<P>
Canst thus in thought my heart attaint:<BR>
No warning charge from thee I need;<BR>
Ne'er could such crime from me proceed.<BR>
The words my guilty mother spake<BR>
When fondly jealous for my sake--<BR>
Think not that I, to triumph moved,<BR>
Those words approve or e'er approved.<BR>
O Hermit, I have sought this place<BR>
To win the lordly hero's grace,<BR>
To throw me at my brother's feet<BR>
And lead him to his royal seat.<BR>
To this, my journey's aim and end,<BR>
Thou shouldst, O Saint, thy favour lend:<BR>
Where is the lord of earth? do thou,<BR>
Most holy, say, where roams he now?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then, by the saint Vas'ishtha pressed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And all the gathered priests beside,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To Bharat's dutiful request<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The hermit graciously replied:<BR>
'Worthy of thee, O Prince, this deed,<BR>
True son of Raghu's ancient seed.<BR>
I know thee reverent, well-controlled,<BR>
The glory of the good of old.<BR>
I grant thy prayer: in this pursuit<BR>
I know thy heart is resolute.<BR>
'Tis for thy sake those words I said<BR>
That wider still thy fame may spread.<BR>
I know where R&aacute;ma, duty-tried,<BR>
His brother, and his wife abide.<BR>
Where Chitrak&uacute;ta's heights arise<BR>
Thy brother R&aacute;ma's dwelling lies.<BR>
Go thither with the morning's light,<BR>
And stay with all thy lords tonight:<BR>
For I would show thee honour high,<BR>
And do not thou my wish deny.'<BR>
