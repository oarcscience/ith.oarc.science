<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXII.: VIS'V&Aacute;MITRA'S SACRIFICE.</H3>
<P>
That conquering pair, of royal race,<BR>
Skilled to observe due time and place,<BR>
To K&uacute;s'ik's hermit son addressed,<BR>
In timely words, their meet request:<BR>
'When must we, lord, we pray thee tell,<BR>
Those Rovers of the Night repel?<BR>


<P>
Speak, lest we let the moment fly,<BR>
And pass the due occasion by.'<BR>
Thus longing for the strife, they prayed,<BR>
And thus the hermits answer made:<BR>
'Till the fifth day be come and past,<BR>
O Raghu's sons, your watch must last,<BR>
The saint his Diksh&aacute; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> has begun,<BR>
And all that time will speak to none.'<BR>
Soon as the steadfast devotees<BR>
Had made reply in words like these,<BR>
The youths began, disdaining sleep,<BR>
Six days and nights their watch to keep.<BR>
The warrior pair who tamed the foe,<BR>
Unrivalled benders of the bow,<BR>
Kept watch and ward unwearied still<BR>
To guard the saint from scathe and ill.<BR>
'Twas now the sixth returning day,<BR>
The hour foretold had past away.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma cried: 'O Lakshman, now<BR>
Firm, watchful, resolute be thou.<BR>
The fiends as yet have kept afar<BR>
From the pure grove in which we are;<BR>
Yet waits us, ere the day shall close,<BR>
Dire battle with the demon foes.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  While thus spoke R&aacute;ma borne away<BR>
By longing for the deadly fray,<BR>
See! bursting from the altar came<BR>
The sudden glory of the flame.<BR>
Round priest and deacon, and upon<BR>
Grass, ladles, flowers, the splendour shone,<BR>
And the high rite, in order due,<BR>
With sacred texts began anew.<BR>
But then a loud and fearful roar<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Re-echoed through the sky;<BR>
And like vast clouds that shadow o'er<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The heavens in dark July,<BR>
Involved in gloom of magic might<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Two fiends rushed on amain,<BR>
M&aacute;richa, Rover of the Night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Suv&aacute;hu, and their train.<BR>
As on they came in wild career<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thick blood in rain they shed;<BR>
And R&aacute;ma saw those things of fear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Impending overhead.<BR>
Then soon as those accursed two<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Who showered down blood be spied,<BR>
Thus to his brother brave and true<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Spoke R&aacute;ma lotus-eyed:<BR>
'Now, Lakshman, thou these fiends shalt see,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Man-eaters, foul of mind,<BR>
Before my mortal weapon flee<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like clouds before the wind.'<BR>
He spoke. An arrow, swift as thought,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Upon his bow he pressed,<BR>
And smote, to utmost fury wrought,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  M&aacute;richa on the breast.<BR>
Deep in his flesh the weapon lay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Winged by the mystic spell,<BR>

<P>
And, hurled a hundred leagues away,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  In ocean's flood he fell.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma, when he saw the foe<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Convulsed and mad with pain<BR>
'Neath the chill-pointed weapon's blow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To Lakshman spoke again:<BR>
'See, Lakshman, see! this mortal dart<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  That strikes a numbing chill,<BR>
Hath struck him senseless with the smart,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But left him breathing still.<BR>
But these who love the evil way,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And drink the blood they spill,<BR>
Rejoicing holy rites to stay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fierce plagues, my hand shall kill.'<BR>
He seized another shaft, the best,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Aglow with living flame;<BR>
It struck Suv&aacute;hu on the chest,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  And dead to earth he came.<BR>
Again a dart, the Wind-God's own,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Upon his string he laid,<BR>
And all the demons were o'erthrown,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The saints no more afraid.<BR>
When thus the fiends were slain in fight,<BR>
Disturbers of each holy rite,<BR>
Due honour by the saints was paid<BR>
To R&aacute;ma for his wondrous aid:<BR>
So Indra is adored when he<BR>
Has won some glorious victory.<BR>
Success at last the rite had crowned,<BR>
And Visv&aacute;mitra gazed around,<BR>
And seeing every side at rest,<BR>
The son of Raghu thus addressed:<BR>
'My joy, O Prince, is now complete:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thou hast obeyed my will:<BR>
Perfect before, this calm retreat<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Is now more perfect still.'<BR>
