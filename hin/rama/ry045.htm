<P>
High and more high their wonder rose<BR>
As the strange story reached its close,<BR>
And thus, with Lakshman, R&aacute;ma, best<BR>
Of Raghu's sons, the saint addressed:<BR>
'Most wondrous is the tale which thou<BR>
Hast told of heavenly Gang&aacute;, how<BR>
From realms above descending she<BR>
Flowed through the land and filled the sea.<BR>
In thinking o'er what thou hast said<BR>
The night has like a moment fled,<BR>
Whose hours in musing have been spent<BR>
Upon thy words most excellent:<BR>
So much, O holy Sage, thy lore<BR>
Has charmed us with this tale of yore.'<BR>

<P>
Day dawned. The morning rites were done<BR>
And the victorious Raghu's son<BR>
Addressed the sage in words like these,<BR>
Rich in his long austerities:<BR>
'The night is past: the morn is clear;<BR>
Told is the tale so good to hear:<BR>
Now o'er that river let us go,<BR>
Three-pathed, the best of all that flow.<BR>
This boat stands ready on the shore<BR>
To bear the holy hermits o'er,<BR>
Who of thy coming warned, in haste,<BR>
The barge upon the bank have placed.'<BR>

<P>
And Kas'ik's son approved his speech,<BR>
And moving to the sandy beach,<BR>
Placed in the boat the hermit band,<BR>
And reached the river's further strand.<BR>
On the north bank their feet they set,<BR>
And greeted all the (<I>illegible</I>) they met.<BR>
On Gang&aacute;'s shore they lighted down,<BR>
And saw Vis'ada's lovely town.<BR>
Thither, the princes by his side,<BR>
The best of holy hermits hied.<BR>
It was a town exceeding fair<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
That might with heaven itself compare.<BR>
Then, suppliant palm to palm applied,<BR>
Famed R&aacute;ma asked his holy guide:<BR>
'O best of hermits, say what race<BR>
Of monarchs rules this lovely place.<BR>
Dear master, let my prayer prevail,<BR>
For much I long to hear the tale.'<BR>
Moved by his words, the saintly man<BR>
Vis'&aacute;l&aacute;'s ancient tale began:<BR>
'List, Rama, list, with closest heed<BR>
The tale of Indra's wondrous deed,<BR>
And mark me as I truly tell<BR>
What here in ancient days befell.<BR>
Ere Krita's famous Age&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> had fled.<BR>
Strong were the sons of Diti&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> bred;<BR>
And Aditi's brave children too<BR>
Were very mighty, good, and true.<BR>
The rival brothers fierce and bold<BR>
Were sons of Kas'yap lofty-souled.<BR>
Of sister mothers born, they vied,<BR>
Brood against brood, in jealous pride.<BR>
Once, as they say, band met with band,<BR>
And, joined in awful council, planned<BR>
To live, unharmed by age and time,<BR>
Immortal in their youthful prime.<BR>
Then this was, after due debate,<BR>
The counsel of the wise and great,<BR>
To churn with might the milky sea&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
The life-bestowing drink to free.<BR>
This planned, they seized the Serpent King,<BR>
V&aacute;suki, for their churning-string,<BR>
And Mandar's mountain for their pole,<BR>
And churned with all their heart and soul.<BR>
As thus, a thousand seasons through,<BR>
This way and that the snake they drew,<BR>
Biting the rocks, each tortured head,<BR>
A very deadly venom shed.<BR>
Thence, bursting like a mighty flame,<BR>
A pestilential poison came,<BR>
Consuming, as it onward ran,<BR>
The home of God, and fiend, and man.<BR>
Then all the suppliant Gods in fear<BR>
To S'ankar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, mighty lord, drew near.<BR>
To Rudra, King of Herds, dismayed,<BR>
'Save us, O save us, Lord!' they prayed.<BR>
Then Vishnu, bearing shell, and mace,<BR>
And discus, showed his radiant face,<BR>
And thus addressed in smiling glee<BR>
The Trident wielding deity:<BR>
What treasure first the Gods upturn<BR>
From troubled Ocean, as they churn,<BR>
Should--for thou art the eldest--be<BR>
Conferred, O best of Gods, on thee.<BR>


<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>


<P>
Then come, and for thy birthright's sake,<BR>
This venom as thy firstfruits take.'<BR>
He spoke, and vanished from their sight.<BR>
When Siva saw their wild affright,<BR>
And heard his speech by whom is borne<BR>
The mighty bow of bending horn,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="#fn_204"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
The poisoned flood at once he quaffed<BR>
As 'twere the Amrit's heavenly draught.<BR>
Then from the Gods departing went<BR>
S'iva, the Lord pre-eminent.<BR>
The host of Gods and Asurs still<BR>
Kept churning with one heart and will.<BR>
But Mandar's mountain, whirling round.<BR>
Pierced to the depths below the ground.<BR>
Then Gods and bards in terror flew<BR>
To him who mighty Madhu slew.<BR>
'Help of all beings! more than all,<BR>
The Gods on thee for aid may call.<BR>
Ward off, O mighty-armed! our fate,<BR>
And bear up Mandar's threatening weight.'<BR>
Then Vishnu, as their need was sore,<BR>
The semblance of a tortoise wore,<BR>
And in the bed of Ocean lay<BR>
The mountain on his back to stay.<BR>
Then he, the soul pervading all,<BR>
Whose locks in radiant tresses fall,<BR>
One mighty arm extended still,<BR>
And grasped the summit of the hill.<BR>
So ranged among the Immortals, he<BR>
Joined in the churning of the sea.<BR>

<P>
A thousand years had reached their close,<BR>
When calmly from the ocean rose<BR>
The gentle sage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> with staff and can,<BR>
Lord of the art of healing man.<BR>
Then as the waters foamed and boiled.<BR>
As churning still the Immortals toiled,<BR>
Of winning face and lovely frame,<BR>
Forth sixty million fair ones came.<BR>
Born of the foam and water, these<BR>
Were aptly named Apsarases.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_206"><FONT SIZE="1">3b</FONT></A><BR>

Each had her maids. The tongue would fail--<BR>
So vast the throng--to count the tale,<BR>
But when no God or Titan wooed<BR>
A wife from all that multitude,<BR>
Refused by all, they gave their love<BR>
In common to the Gods above.<BR>
Then from the sea still vext and wild<BR>
Rose Sur&aacute;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Varun's maiden child.<BR>
A fitting match she sought to find:<BR>
But Diti's sons her love declined.<BR>
Their kinsmen of the rival brood<BR>
To the pure maid in honour sued.<BR>
Hence those who loved that nymph so fair<BR>
The hallowed name of Suras bear.<BR>
And Asurs are the Titan crowd<BR>
Her gentle claims who disallowed.<BR>
Then from the foamy sea was freed<BR>
Uchchaihs'ravas,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the generous steed,<BR>
And Kaustubha, of gems the gem,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
And Soma, Moon God, after them.<BR>

<P>
At length when many a year had fled,<BR>
Up floated, on her lotus bed,<BR>
A maiden fair and tender-eyed,<BR>
In the young flush of beauty's pride.<BR>
She shone with pearl and golden sheen,<BR>
And seals of glory stamped her queen.<BR>
On each round arm glowed many a gem,<BR>
On her smooth brows, a diadem,<BR>
Rolling in waves beneath her crown<BR>
The glory of her hair flowed down.<BR>
Pearls on her neck of price untold,<BR>
The lady shone like burnisht gold.<BR>
Queen of the Gods, she leapt to land,<BR>
A lotus in her perfect hand,<BR>


<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
And fondly, of the lotus-sprung,<BR>
To lotus-bearing Vishnu clung.<BR>
Her Gods above and men below<BR>
As Beauty's Queen and Fortune know.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="ry046.htm#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
Gods, Titans, and the minstrel train<BR>
Still churned and wrought the troubled main.<BR>
At length the prize so madly sought,<BR>
The Amrit, to their sight was brought.<BR>
For the rich spoil,'twixt these and those<BR>
A fratricidal war arose,<BR>
And, host 'gainst host in battle, set,<BR>
Aditi's sons and Diti's met.<BR>
United, with the giants' aid,<BR>
Their fierce attack the Titans made,<BR>
And wildly raged for many a day<BR>
That universe-astounding fray.<BR>
When wearied arms were faint to strike,<BR>
And ruin threatened all alike,<BR>
Vishnu, with art's illusive aid,<BR>
The Amrit from their sight conveyed.<BR>
That Best of Beings smote his foes<BR>
Who dared his deathless arm oppose:<BR>
Yea, Vishnu, all-pervading God,<BR>
Beneath his feet the Titans trod<BR>
Aditi's race, the sons of light,<BR>
slew Diti's brood in cruel fight.<BR>
Then town-destroying&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="ry046.htm#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">2b</FONT></A> Indra gained<BR>
His empire, and in glory reigned<BR>
O'er the three worlds with bard and sage<BR>
Rejoicing in his heritage.<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_206"></A><A HREF="ry045.htm#fr_206">57:3b</A>  The poet plays upon the word and
fancifully derives it from <I>apsu</I>, the locative
case plural of <I>ap</I>, water, and <I>rasa</I>,
taste.... The word is probably derived
from <I>ap</I>, water, and <I>sri</I>, to go, and seems
to signify <I>inhabitants of the water</I>, nymphs
of the stream; or, as Goldst&uuml;cker thinks
(Dict. s.v.) these divinities were originally
personifications of the vapours which are
attracted by the sun and form into mist
or clouds.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_207"></A><A HREF="ry045.htm#fr_207">58:1</A>  '<I>Sur&aacute;</I>, the feminine comprehends all
sorts of intoxicating liquors, many kinds
of which the Indians from the earliest
times distilled and prepared from rice,
sugar-cane, the palm tree, and various
flowers and plants. Nothing is considered
more disgraceful among orthodox Hindus
than drunkenness, and the use of wine is
forbidden not only to Br&aacute;hmans but the
two other orders as well.... So it clearly
appears derogatory to the dignity of the
Gods to have received a nymph so pernicious,
who ought rather to have been
made over to the Titans. However the
etymological fancy has prevailed. The
word <I>Sura</I>, a God, is derived from the
indeclinable <I>Svar</I> heaven.' SCHLEGEL.</P>
