<P>
Still was the cry,'The V&aacute;nar foes<BR>
Around the leaguered city close.'<BR>
King R&aacute;van from the terrace gazed<BR>
And saw, with eyes where fury blazed,<BR>
The V&aacute;nar host in serried ranks<BR>
Press to the moat and line the banks,<BR>
And, first in splendour and in place,<BR>
The lion lord of Raghu's race.<BR>
And R&aacute;ma looked on Lank&aacute; where<BR>
Gay flags were streaming to the air,<BR>
And, while keen sorrow pierced him through,<BR>
His loving thoughts to Sit&aacute; flew:<BR>
'There, there in deep affliction lies<BR>
My darling with the fawn-like eyes.<BR>
There on the cold bare ground she keeps<BR>
Sad vigil and for R&aacute;ma weeps.'<BR>
Mad with the thought, 'Charge, charge,' he cried.<BR>
'Let earth with R&aacute;kshas blood be dyed.'<BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Responsive to his call rang out<BR>
A loud, a universal shout,<BR>
As myriads filled the moat with stone,<BR>
Trees, rocks, and mountains overthrown,<BR>
And charging at their leader's call<BR>
Pressed forward furious to the wall.<BR>
Some in their headlong ardour scaled<BR>
The rampart's height, the guard assailed,<BR>
And many a ponderous fragment rent<BR>
From portal, tower, and battlement.<BR>
Huge gates adorned with burnished gold<BR>
Were loosed and lifted from their hold;<BR>
And post and pillar, with a sound<BR>
Like thunder, fell upon the ground.<BR>
At every portal, east and west<BR>
And north and south, the chieftains pressed<BR>
Each in his post appointed led<BR>
His myriads in the forest bred.<BR>

<P>
'Charge, let the gates be opened wide:<BR>
'Charge, charge, my giants,' R&aacute;van cried.<BR>
They heard his voice, and loud and long<BR>
Rang the wild clamour of the throng,<BR>
And shell and drum their notes upsent,<BR>
And every martial instrument.<BR>
Forth, at the bidding of their lord<BR>
From every gate the giants poured,<BR>
As, when the waters rise and swell.<BR>
Huge waves preceding waves impel.<BR>

<P>
Again from every V&aacute;nar throat<BR>
A scream of fierce defiance smote<BR>
The welkin: earth and sea and sky<BR>
Re&euml;choed with the awful cry.<BR>
The roar of elephants, the neigh<BR>
Of horses eager for the fray.<BR>
The frequent clash of warriors' steel,<BR>
The rattling of the chariot wheel.<BR>
Fierce was the deadly fight: opposed<BR>
In terrible array they closed,<BR>
As when the Gods of heaven enraged<BR>
With rebel fiends wild battle waged.<BR>
Axe, spear, and mace were wielded well:<BR>
At every blow a V&aacute;nar fell.<BR>
But shivered rock and brandished tree<BR>
Brought many a giant on his knee,<BR>
To perish in his turn beneath<BR>
The deadly wounds of nails and teeth.<BR>
