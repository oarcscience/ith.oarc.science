### CANTO LXV.: KHUMBHAKARNA'S SPEECH.

But haughty Kumbhakarna spurned  
His counsel, and to Rávan turned:  
'Thy life from peril will I free  
And slay the foe who threatens thee.  
A hero never vaunts in vain,  
Like bellowing clouds devoid of rain,  
Nor, Monarch, be thine ear inclined  
To counsellors of slavish kind,  
Who with mean arts their king mislead  
And mar each gallant plan and deed.  
O, let not words like his beguile  
The glorious king of Lanka's isle.'  
   Thus scornful Kumbhakarna cried,  
And Rávan with a laugh replied:  
'Mahodar fears and fain would shun  
The battle with Ikshvaku's son.  
Of all my giant warriors, who  
Is strong as thou, and brave and true?  
Ride, conqueror, to the battle ride,  
And tame the foeman's senseless pride.  
Go forth like Yama to the field,  
And let thine arm thy trident wield.  
Scared by the lightning of thine eye  
The Vanar hosts will turn and fly;  
And Rama, when he sees thee near,  
With trembling heart will own his fear.'  
   The champion heard, and, well content,  
Forth from the hall his footsteps bent.  
He grasped his spear, the foeman's dread,  
Black iron all, both shaft and head.  
Which, dyed in many a battle, bore  
Great spots of slaughtered victims' gore.  
The king upon his neck had thrown  
The jewelled chain which graced his own.  
And garlands of delicious scent  
About his limbs for ornament.  
Around his arms gay bracelets clung,  
And pendants in his ears were hung.  
Adorned with gold, about his waist  
His coat of mail was firmly braced,  
And like Náráyan  <span id="fr_992"></span>[1b](#fn_992.md) or the God  
Who rules the sky he proudly trod.  
Behind him went a mighty throng  
Of giant warriors tall and strong,  

<span id="page_477">p. 477</span>  

On elephants of noblest breeds.  
With cars, with camels, and with steeds:  
And, armed with spear and axe and sword  
Were fain to battle for their lord.  <span
