### CANTO CXVI.: THE HERMIT'S SPEECH.

When Bharat took his homeward road  
Still Ráma in the wood abode:  
But soon he marked the fear and care  
That darkened all the hermits there.  
For all who dwelt before the hill  
Were sad with dread of coming ill:  
Each holy brow was lined by thought,  
And Ráma's side they often sought.  
With gathering frowns the prince they eyed,  
And then withdrew and talked aside.  

Then Raghu's son with anxious breast  
The leader of the saints addressed:  
'Can aught that I have done displease,  
O reverend Sage, the devotees?  
Why are their loving looks, O say,  
Thus sadly changed or turned away?  
Has Lakshman through his want of heed  
Offended with unseemly deed!  
Or is the gentle Sítá, she  
Who loved to honour you and me--  
Is she the cause of this offence,  
Failing in lowly reverence?'  

One sage, o'er whom, exceeding old,  
Had many a year of penance rolled,  
Trembling in every aged limb  
Thus for the rest replied to him:  
'How could we, O beloved, blame  
Thy lofty-souled Videhan dame,  
Who in the good of all delights,  
And more than all of anchorites?  
But yet through thee a numbing dread  
Of fiends among our band has spread;  
Obstructed by the demons' art  
The trembling hermits talk apart.  
For Rávan's brother, overbold,  
Named Khara, of gigantic mould,  
Vexes with fury fierce and fell  
All those in Janasthán  <span id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_399) who
dwell.  
Resistless in his cruel deeds,  
On flesh of men the monster feeds:  
Sinful and arrogant is he,  
And looks with special hate on thee.  
Since thou, beloved son, hast made  
Thy home within this holy shade,  
The fiends have vexed with wilder rage  
The dwellers of the hermitage.  
In many a wild and dreadful form  
Around the trembling saints they swarm,  
With hideous shape and foul disguise  
They terrify our holy eyes.  
They make our loathing souls endure  
Insult and scorn and sights impure,  
And flocking round the altars stay  
The holy rites we love to pay.  
In every spot throughout the grove  
With evil thoughts the monsters rove,  
Assailing with their secret might  
Each unsuspecting anchorite.  
Ladle and dish away they fling,  
Our fires with floods extinguishing,  
And when the sacred flame should burn  
They trample on each water-urn.  
Now when they see their sacred wood  
Plagued by this impious brotherhood,  
The troubled saints away would roam  
And seek in other shades a home:  
Hence will we fly, O Ráma, ere  
The cruel fiends our bodies tear.  
Not far away a forest lies  
Rich in the roots and fruit we prize,  
To this will I and all repair  
And join the holy hermits there;  
Be wise, and with us thither flee  
Before this Khara injure thee.  
Mighty art thou, O Ráma, yet  
Each day with peril is beset.  
If with thy consort by thy side  
Thou in this wood wilt still abide.'  

He ceased: the words the hero spake  
The hermit's purpose failed to break:  
To Raghu's son farewell he said,  
And blessed the chief and comforted;  
Then with the rest the holy sage  
Departed from the hermitage.  

So from the wood the saints withdrew,  
And Ráma bidding all adieu  
   In lowly reverence bent:  
Instructed by their friendly speech,  
Blest with the gracious love of each,  
   To his pure home he went.  
Nor would the son of Raghu stray  
A moment from that grove away  
   From which the saints had fled.  
And many a hermit thither came  
Attracted by his saintly fame  
   And the pure life he led.
