### CANTO XXV.: THE HERMITAGE OF LOVE.

Soon as appeared the morning light  
Up rose the mighty anchorite,  
And thus to youthful Ráma said,  
Who lay upon his leafy bed:  
'High fate is hers who calls thee son:  
   Arise,'tis break of day;  
Rise, Chief, and let those rites be done  
   Due at the morning's ray.' <span id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_150.md)  
At that great sage's high behest  
   Up sprang the princely pair,  
To bathing rites themselves addressed,  
   And breathed the holiest prayer.  
Their morning task completed, they  
   To Vis'vámitra came  

That store of holy works, to pay  
   The worship saints may claim.  
Then to the hallowed spot they went  
   Along fair Sarjú's side  
Where mix her waters confluent  
   With three-pathed Gangá's tide.  <span
id="fr_151"></span>[1b](#fn_151.md)  
There was a sacred hermitage  
   Where saints devout of mind  
Their lives through many a lengthened age  
   To penance had resigned.  
That pure abode the princes eyed  
   With unrestrained delight,  
And thus unto the saint they cried.  
   Rejoicing at the sight:  
'Whose is that hermitage we see?  
   Who makes his dwelling there?  
Full of desire to hear are we:  
   O Saint, the truth declare.'  
The hermit smiling made reply  
   To the two boys' request:  
'Hear, Rama, who in days gone by  
   This calm retreat possessed.  
Kandarpa in apparent form,  
   Called Káma  <span id="fr_152"></span>[2b](#fn_152.md) by the wise,  
Dared Umá's  <span id="fr_153"></span>[3b](#fn_153.md) new-wed lord to
storm  
   And make the God his prize.  
'Gainst Sthánu's  <span id="fr_154"></span>[4b](#fn_154.md) self, on rites
austere  
   And vows intent,  <span id="fr_155"></span>[5b](#fn_155.md) they say,  
His bold rash hand be dared to rear,  
   Though Sthánu cried, Away!  
But the God's eye with scornful glare  
   Fell terrible on him.  
Dissolved the shape that was so fair  

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>  

   And burnt up every limb.  
Since the great God's terrific rage  
   Destroyed his form and frame,  
Káma in each succeeding age  
   Has borne Ananga's  <span id="fr_156"></span>[1](ry028.htm#fn_156.md)
name.  
So, where his lovely form decayed,  
   This land is Anga styled:  
Sacred to him of old this shade,  
   And hermits undefiled.  
Here Scripture-talking elders sway  
   Each sense with firm control,  
And penance-rites have washed away  
   All sin from every soul.  
One night, fair boy, we here will spend,  
   A pure stream on each hand,  
And with to-morrow's light will bend  
   Our steps to yonder strand.  
Here let us bathe, and free from stain  
   To that pure grove repair,  
Sacred to Káma, and remain  
   One night in comfort there.'  
With penance' far-discerning eye  
   The saintly men beheld  
Their coming, and with transport high  
   Each holy bosom swelled.  
To Kus'ik's son the gift they gave  
   That honoured guest should greet,  
Water they brought his feet to lave,  
   And showed him honor meet.  
Ráma, and Lakshman next obtained  
   In due degree their share.  
Then with sweet talk the guests remained,  
   And charmed each listener there.  
The evening prayers were duly said  
   With voices calm and low:  
Then on the ground each laid his head  
   And slept till morning's glow.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[37:5b](ry027.htm#fr_155.md) The practice of
austerities, voluntary tortures, and mortifications was anciently
universal in India, and was held by the Indians to be of immense
efficacy. Hence they mortified themselves to expiate sins, to acquire
merits, and to obtain superhuman gifts and powers; the Gods themselves
sometimes exercised themselves in such austerities, either to raise
themselves to greater power and grandeur, or to counteract the
austerities of man which threatened to prevail over them and to deprive
them of heaven.... Such austerities were called in India *tapas*
(burning ardour, fervent devotion) and he who practised them
*tapasvin*.'GORRESIO.
