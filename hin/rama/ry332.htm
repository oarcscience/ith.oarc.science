<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LVII.: ANGAD'S SPEECH.</H3>
<P>
Though grief and woe his utterance broke<BR>
They trusted not the words he spoke;<BR>
But, looking still for secret guile,<BR>
Reflected in their hearts a while:<BR>
'If on our mangled limbs he feed,<BR>
We gain the death ourselves decreed.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then rose the V&aacute;nar chiefs, and lent<BR>
Their arms to aid the bird's descent;<BR>
And Angad spake: There lived of yore<BR>
A noble V&aacute;nar king who bore<BR>
The name of Riksharajas, great<BR>
And brave and strong and fortunate.<BR>
His sons were like their father: fame<BR>
Knows B&aacute;li and Sugr&iacute;va's name.<BR>
Praised in all lands, a glorious king<BR>
Was B&aacute;li, and from him I spring.<BR>
Brave R&aacute;ma, Das'aratha's heir,<BR>
A glorious prince beyond compare,<BR>
His sire and duty's law obeyed,<BR>
And sought the depths of Dandaks' shade<BR>
S&iacute;t&aacute; his well-beloved dame,<BR>
And Lakshman, with the wanderer came.<BR>
A giant watched his hour, and stole<BR>
The sweet delight of R&aacute;ma's soul.<BR>
Jat&aacute;yus, Das'aratha's friend,<BR>
Swift succour to the dame would lend.<BR>
Fierce R&aacute;van from his car he felled,<BR>
And for a time the prize withheld.<BR>
But bleeding, weak with years, and tired,<BR>
Beneath the demon's blows expired,<BR>
Due rites at R&aacute;ma's hands obtained,<BR>
And bliss that ne'er shall minish, gained.<BR>
Then R&aacute;ma with Sugr&iacute;va made<BR>
A covenant for mutual aid,<BR>
And B&aacute;li, to the field defied,<BR>
By conquering R&aacute;ma's arrow died.<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va then, by R&aacute;ma's grace,<BR>
Was monarch of the V&aacute;nar race.<BR>
By his command a mighty host<BR>
Seeks R&aacute;ma's queen from coast to coast.<BR>
Sent forth by him, in every spot<BR>
We looked for her, but find her not.<BR>
Vain is the toil, as though by night<BR>
We sought to find the Day-God's light.<BR>
In lands unknown at length we found<BR>
A spacious cavern under ground,<BR>
Whose vaults that stretch beneath the hill<BR>
Were formed by Maya's magic skill.<BR>
Through the dark maze our steps were bent,<BR>
And wandering there a month we spent,<BR>

<P>
And lost, in fruitless error, thus<BR>
The days our king allotted us.<BR>
Thus we though faithful have transgressed,<BR>
And failed to keep our lord's behest.<BR>
No chance of safety can we see,<BR>
No lingering hope of life have we.<BR>
Sugriva's wrath and R&aacute;ma's hate<BR>
Press on our souls with grievous weight;<BR>
And we, because 'tis vain to fly,<BR>
Resolve at length to fast and die.'<BR>
