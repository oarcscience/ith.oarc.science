<P>
Then R&aacute;ma, like the lotus eyed,<BR>
Descended from the mountain side,<BR>
And to the Maithil lady showed<BR>
The lovely stream that softly flowed.<BR>
And thus Ayodhy&aacute;'s lord addressed<BR>
His bride, of dames the loveliest,<BR>
Child of Videha's king, her face<BR>
Bright with the fair moon's tender grace:<BR>
'How sweetly glides, O darling, look,<BR>
Mand&aacute;kin&iacute;'s delightful brook,<BR>
Adorned with islets, blossoms gay,<BR>
And s'arases and swans at play!<BR>

<P>
The trees with which her banks are lined<BR>
Show flowers and fruit of every kind:<BR>
The match in radiant sheen is she<BR>
Of King Kuvera's Nalini. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_373"></A><A HREF="#fn_373"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
My heart exults with pleasure new<BR>
The shelving hand and ford to view,<BR>
Where gathering herds of thirsty deer<BR>
Disturb the wave that ran so clear.<BR>
Now look, those holy hermits mark<BR>
In skins of deer and coats of bark;<BR>
With twisted coils of matted hair,<BR>
The reverend men are bathing there,<BR>
And as they lift their arms on high<BR>
The Lord of Day they glorify:<BR>
These best of saints, my large-eyed spouse,<BR>
Are constant to their sacred vows.<BR>
The mountain dances while the trees<BR>
Bend their proud summits to the breeze,<BR>
And scatter many a flower and bud<BR>
From branches that o'erhang the flood.<BR>
There flows the stream like lucid pearl,<BR>
Round islets here the currents whirl,<BR>
And perfect saints from middle air<BR>
Are flocking to the waters there.<BR>
See, there lie flowers in many a heap<BR>
From boughs the whistling breezes sweep,<BR>
And others wafted by the gale<BR>
Down the swift current dance and sail.<BR>
Now see that pair of wild-fowl rise,<BR>
Exulting with their joyful cries:<BR>
Hark, darling, wafted from afar<BR>
How soft their pleasant voices are.<BR>
To gaze on Churakuta's hill,<BR>
To look upon this lovely rill,<BR>
To bend mine eyes on thee, dear wife,<BR>
Is sweeter than my city life.<BR>
Come, bathe we in the pleasant rill<BR>
Whose dancing waves are never still,<BR>
Stirred by those beings pure from sin,<BR>
The sanctities who bathe therein:<BR>
Come, dearest, to the stream descend,<BR>
Approach her as a darling friend,<BR>
And dip thee in the silver flood<BR>
Which lotuses and lilies stud.<BR>
Let this fair hill Ayodhya seem,<BR>
Its silvan things her people deem,<BR>
And let these waters as they flow<BR>
Our own beloved Sarju show.<BR>
How blest, mine own dear love, am I;<BR>
Thou, fond and true, art ever nigh,<BR>
And duteous, faithful Lakshman stays<BR>
Beside me, and my word obeys.<BR>
Here every day I bathe me thrice,<BR>
Fruit, honey, roots for food suffice,<BR>
And ne'er my thoughts with longing stray<BR>
To distant home or royal sway.<BR>
For who this charming brook can see<BR>
Where herds of roedeer wander free,<BR>


<P>


<P>
And on the flowery-wooded brink<BR>
Apes, elephants, and lions drink,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Nor feel all sorrow fly?'<BR>
Thus eloquently spoke the pride<BR>
Of Raghu's children to his bride,<BR>
And wandered happy by her side<BR>
Where Chitrakuta azure-dyed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Uprears his peaks on high.<BR>
