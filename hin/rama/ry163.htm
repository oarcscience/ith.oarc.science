<P>
Thus tho Nishadas' king besought:<BR>
The prince with spirit wisdom-fraught<BR>

<P>

<P>
Replied in seemly words that blent<BR>
Deep matter with the argument:<BR>
'Thou, friend of him whom I revere,<BR>
With honours high hast met me here,<BR>
For thou alone wouldst entertain<BR>
Aud feed to-day so vast a train."<BR>
In such fair words the prince replied,<BR>
Then, pointing to the path he cried:<BR>
'Which way aright will lead my feet<BR>
To Bharadv&aacute;ja's calm retreat;<BR>
For all this land near Gang&aacute;'s streams<BR>
Pathless and hard to traverse seems?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spoke the prince: King Guha heard<BR>
Delighted every prudent word,<BR>
And gazing on that forest wide,<BR>
Raised suppliant hands, and thus replied:<BR>
'My servants, all the ground who know,<BR>
O glorious Prince, with thee shall go<BR>
With constant care thy way to guide,<BR>
And I will journey by thy side.<BR>
But this thy host so wide dispread<BR>
Wakes in my heart one doubt and dread,<BR>
Lest, threatening R&aacute;ma good and great,<BR>
Ill thoughts thy journey stimulate."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But wheu King Guha, ill at ease,<BR>
Declared his fear in words like these,<BR>
As pure as is the cloudless sky<BR>
With soft voice Bharat made reply:<BR>
'Suspect me not: ne'er come the time<BR>
For me to plot so foul a crime!<BR>
He is my eldest brother, he<BR>
Is like a father dear to me.<BR>
I go to lead my brother thence<BR>
Who makes the wood his residence.<BR>
No thought but this thy heart should frame:<BR>
This simple truth my lips proclaim.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then with glad cheer King Guha cried,<BR>
With Bharat's answer gratified:<BR>
'Blessed art thou: on earth I see<BR>
None who may vie, O Prince, with thee,<BR>
Who canst of thy free will resign<BR>
The kingdom which unsought is thine.<BR>
For this, a name that ne'er shall die,<BR>
Thy glory through the worlds shall fly,<BR>
Who fain wouldst balm thy brother's pain<BR>
And lead the exile home again.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  As Guha thus, and Bharat, each<BR>
To other spoke in friendly speech,<BR>
The Day God sank with glory dead,<BR>
And night o'er all the sky was spread.<BR>
Soon as King Guha's thoughtful care<BR>
Had quartered all the armv there,<BR>
Well honoured, Bharat laid his head<BR>
Beside S'atrughna on a bed.<BR>
But grief for R&aacute;ma yet oppressed<BR>
High-minded Bharat's faithful breast--<BR>
Such torment little was deserved<BR>
By him who ne'er from duty swerved.<BR>
The fever raged through every vein<BR>
And burnt him with its inward pain:<BR>
So when in woods the flames leap free<BR>

<P>
The fire within consumes the tree.<BR>
From heat of burning anguish sprung<BR>
The sweat upon his body hung,<BR>
As when the sun with fervid glow<BR>
On high Himalaya melts the snow.<BR>
As, banished from the herd, a bull<BR>
Wanders alone and sorrowful.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus sighing and distressed,<BR>
In misery and bitter grief,<BR>
With fevered heart that mocked relief,<BR>
Distracted in his mind, the chief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Still mourned and found no rest.<BR>
