<P>
Thus having warned his brother hold<BR>
He grasped his sword with * gold*<BR>
And followed with the *** in went<BR>
His wr* *ght and *<BR>
Then *<BR>
And *<BR>
Soon *<BR>
The *<BR>

<P>
A while with trembling heart he fled,<BR>
The * and showed his stately head.<BR>
With sword and bow the chief pursued<BR>
Where'or the fleeing deer he viewed<BR>
Sending* from dell* and lone recess<BR>
The splendid ** his loveliness<BR>
Now full in view the creature stood<BR>
Now vanished in the depth of wood;<BR>
Now running with a languid flight,<BR>
Now like a meteor lost to sight.<BR>
With trembling limbs away he sped;<BR>
Then like the moon with clouds o'erspread<BR>
Gleamed for a moment bright between<BR>
The trees, and was again unseen<BR>
Thus in the magic deer's disguise<BR>
Mancha lured him to the prize,<BR>
And seen a while, then lost to view,<BR>
Far from his cot the hero drew.<BR>
Still by the flying game deceived<BR>
The hunter's heart was wroth and grieved,<BR>
And wearied with the fruitless chase<BR>
He stayed him in a shady place.<BR>
Again the river of the night<BR>
*ged the chieftain* full in sight,<BR>
Slow moving in the coppice near,<BR>
Surrounded by the woodland deer<BR>
Again the hunter sought the game<BR>
That seemed a while to court his aim:<BR>
But seized again with sudden dread,<BR>
Beyond his sight the creature fled.<BR>
Again the hero left the shade,<BR>
Again the deer before him strayed.<BR>
With surer hope and stronger will<BR>
The hunter longed his prey to kill.<BR>
Then as his soul impatient grew,<BR>
An arrow from his side he drew,<BR>
Besplendent at the sunbeam's glow,<BR>
The crusher of the smitten foe,<BR>
With skillful bead the mighty lord<BR>
Fixed well shaft and strained the cord.<BR>
Upon the deer his eyes he bent,<BR>
And like a fiery ** went<BR>
The arrow Brahma's self had framed,<BR>
Alive with sparks that hissed and flamed,<BR>
Like Indra's flashing levin, true<BR>
To the false deer the missile flew<BR>
Cleaving his flesh that wonderous dart<BR>
Stood quivering in Mancha's heart.<BR>
Scarce from the ground one foot he sprang,<BR>
Then stricken fell with deadly pang.<BR>
Ha* **, as he pressed* the ground,<BR>
He gave a roar of awful sound<BR>
And *e the wounded giant died<BR>
He threw his borrowed form aside<BR>
Remembering still his lord's behest<BR>
He pondered in his heart how best<BR>
S&iacute;t&aacute;'s plight ** ** guard away,<BR>
And Ravan seize the helpless prey<BR>
The monster knew the time was nigh.<BR>
And called aloud with eager cry,<BR>
'Hi*, S&iacute;t&aacute;, Lakshman* and the tone<BR>

He borrowed was like R&aacute;ma's own<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  So by that matchless arrow cleft,<BR>
The deer's bright form M&aacute;r&iacute;cha left,<BR>
Resumed his giant shape and size<BR>
And closed in death his languid eyes<BR>
When R&aacute;ma saw his awful foe<BR>
Gasp, smeared with blood, in deadly throe,<BR>
His anxious thoughts to S&iacute;t&aacute; sped,<BR>
And the wise words that Lakshman said,<BR>
That this was false M&aacute;r&iacute;cha's art,<BR>
Returned again upon his heart.<BR>
He knew the foe he triumphed o'er<BR>
The name of great M&aacute;r&iacute;cha bore.<BR>
'The fiend,' he pondered, 'ere has died,<BR>
'Ho Lakshman! ho, my S&iacute;t&aacute;!' cried<BR>
Ah, if that cry has reached her ear,<BR>
How dire must be my darling's fear!<BR>
And Lakshman of the mighty arm,<BR>
What thinks he in his wild alarm?<BR>
As thus he thought in sad surmise,<BR>
Each startled hair began to rise,<BR>
And when he saw the giant slain<BR>
And thought upon that cry again,<BR>
His spirit sank and terror pressed<BR>
Full sorely on the hero's breast<BR>
Another deer he chased and struck.<BR>
He bore away the the fallen puck,<BR>
To Janasth&aacute;n then turned his face<BR>
And hastened to his dwelling place.<BR>
