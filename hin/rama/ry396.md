### CANTO LXI.: THE FEAST OF HONEY.

They rose in air: the region grew  
Dark with their shadow as they flew.  
Swift to a lovely grove  <span id="fr_900"></span>[2](#fn_900.md) they
came  
That rivalled heavenly Nandan's  <span id="fr_901"></span>[3](#fn_901.md)
fame  
Where countless bees their honey stored,--  
The pleasance of the Vánars' lord,  
To every creature fenced and barred,  
Which Dadhimukh was set to guard,  
A noble Vánar, brave and bold,  
Sugríva's uncle lofty-souled.  
To Angad came with one accord  
The Vánars, and besought their lord  
That they those honeyed stores might eat  
That made the grove so passing sweet.  
   He gave consent: they sought the trees  
Thronged with innumerable bees.  
They rifled all the treasured store,  
And ate the fruit the branches bore,  
And still as they prolonged the feast  
Their merriment and joy increased.  
Drunk with the sweets, they danced and bowed,  
They wildly sang, they laughed aloud.  
Some climbed and sprang from tree to tree,  
Some sat and chattered in their glee.  
Some scaled the trees which creepers crowned,  
And rained the branches to the ground.  
There with loud laugh a Vánar sprang  
Close to his friend who madly sang,  
In doleful mood another crept  
To mix his tears with one who wept.  
   Then Dadhimukh with fury viewed  
The intoxicated multitude.  
He looked upon the rifled shade,  
And all the ruin they had made;  
Then called with angry voice, and strove  
To save the remnant of the grove,  
But warning cries and words were spurned,  
And angry taunt and threat returned.  
Then fierce and wild contention rose:  
With furious words he mingled blows.  
They by no shame or fear withheld,  
By drunken mood and ire impelled,  
Used claws, and teeth, and hands, and beat  
The keeper under trampling feet.
