### CANTO LII.: RÁVAN'S FLIGHT.

Fair as the lord of silvery rays  
Whom every star in heaven obeys,  
The Maithil dame her plaint renewed  
O'er him by Rávan's might subdued:  
'Dreams, omens, auguries foreshow  
Our coming lot of weal and woe:  
But thou, my Ráma, couldst not see  
The grievous blow which falls on thee.  
The birds and deer desert the brakes  
And show the path my captor takes,  
And thus e'en now this royal bird  
Flew to mine aid by pity stirred.  
Slain for my sake in death he lies,  
The broad-winged rover of the skies.  
O Ráma, haste, thine aid I crave:  
O Lakshman, why delay to save?  
Brave sons of old Ikshváku, hear  
And rescue in this hour of fear.'  
   Her flowery wreath was torn and rent,  
Crushed was each sparkling ornament.  
She with weak arms and trembling knees  
Clung like a creeper to the trees,  
And like some poor deserted thing  
With wild shrieks made the forest ring.  
But swift the giant reached her side,  
<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>  

As loud on Ráma's name she cried.  
Fierce as grim Death one hand he laid  
Upon her tresses' lovely braid.  
That touch, thou impious King, shall be  
The ruin of thy race and thee.  
The universal world in awe  
That outrage on the lady saw.  
All nature shook convulsed with dread,  
And darkness o'er the land was spread.  
The Lord of Day grew dark and chill,  
And every breath of air was still.  
The Eternal Father of the sky  
Beheld the crime with heavenly eye.  
And spake with solemn voice, 'The deed,  
The deed is done, of old decreed.'  
Sad were the saints within the grove,  
But triumph with their sorrow strove.  
They wept to see the Maithil dame  
Endure the outrage, scorn, and shame:  
They joyed because his life should pay  
The penalty incurred that day.  
Then Rávan raised her up, and bare  
His captive through the fields of air,  
Calling with accents loud and shrill  
On Ráma and on Lakshman still.  
With sparkling gems on arm and breast,  
In silk of paly amber dressed,  
High in the air the Maithil dame  
Gleamed like the lightning's flashing flame.  
The giant, as the breezes blew  
Upon her robes of amber hue,  
And round him twined that gay attire,  
Showed like a mountain girt with fire.  
The lady, fairest of the fair,  
Had wreathed a garland round her hair;  
Its lotus petals bright and sweet  
Rained down about the giant's feet.  
Her vesture, bright as burning gold,  
Gave to the wind each glittering fold,  
Fair as a gilded cloud that gleams  
Touched by the Day-God's tempered beams.  
Yet struggling in the fiend's embrace,  
The lady with her sweet pure face,  
Far from her lord, no longer wore  
The light of joy that shone before.  
Like some sad lily by the side  
Of waters which the sun has dried;  
Like the pale moon uprising through  
An autumn cloud of darkest hue,  
So was her perfect face between  
The arms of giant Rávan seen:  
Fair with the charm of braided tress  
And forehead's finished loveliness;  
Fair with the ivory teeth that shed  
White lustre through the lips' fine red,  
Fair as the lotus when the bud  
Is rising from the parent flood.  
With faultless lip and nose and eye.  
Dear as the moon that floods the sky  
With gentle light, of perfect mould,  
She seemed a thing of burnished gold,  

Though on her cheek the traces lay  
Of tears her hand had brushed away,  
But as the moon-beams swiftly fade  
Ere the great Day-God shines displayed,  
So in that form of perfect grace  
Still trembling in the fiend's embrace,  
From her beloved Ráma reft,  
No light of pride or joy was left.  
The lady with her golden hue  
O'er the swart fiend a lustre threw,  
As when embroidered girths enfold  
An elephant with gleams of gold.  
Fair as the lily's bending stem  
Her arms adorned with many a gem,  
A lustre to the fiend she lent  
Gleaming from every ornament,  
As when the cloud-shot flashes light  
The shadows of a mountain height.  
Whene'er the breezes earthward bore  
The tinkling of the zone she wore,  
He seemed a cloud of darkness hue  
Sending forth murmurs as it flew.  
As on her way the dame was sped  
From her sweet neck fair flowers were shed,  
The swift wind caught the flowery rain  
And poured it o'er the fiend again.  
The wind-stirred blossoms, sweet to smell,  
On the dark brows of Rávan fell,  
Like lunar constellations set  
On Meru for a coronet.  
From her small foot an anklet fair  
With jewels slipped, and through the air,  
Like a bright circlet of the flame  
Of thunder, to the valley came.  
The Maithil lady, fair to see  
As the young leaflet of a tree  
Clad in the tender hues of spring,  
Flashed glory on the giant king,  
As when a gold-embroidered zone  
Around an elephant is thrown.  
While, bearing far the lady, through  
The realms of sky the giant flew,  
She like a gleaming meteor cast  
A glory round her as she passed.  
Then from each limb in swift descent  
Dropped many a sparkling ornament:  
On earth they rested dim and pale  
Like fallen stars when virtues fail. <span
id="fr_505"></span>[1](#fn_505)  
Around her neck a garland lay  
Bright as the Star-God's silvery ray:  
It fell and flashed like Gangá sent  
From heaven above the firmament. <span id="fr_506"></span>[2](#fn_506)  
The birds of every wing had flocked  
To stately trees by breezes rocked:  

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>  

These bowed their wind-swept heads and  
said:  
'My lady sweet, be comforted.'  
With faded blooms each brook within  
Whose waters moved no gleamy fin,  
Stole sadly through the forest dell  
Mourning the dame it loved so well.  
From every woodland region near  
Came lions, tigers, birds, and deer,  
And followed, each with furious look,  
The way her flying shadow took.  
For Sítá's loss each lofty hill  
Whose tears were waterfall, and rill,  
Lifting on high each arm-like steep,  
Seemed in the general woe to weep.  
When the great sun, the lord of day,  
Saw Rávan tear the dame away,  
His glorious light began to fail  
And all his disk grew cold and pale.  
'If Rávan from the forest hies\*\*  
With Ráma's Sítá as his prize,  
Justice and truth have vanished hence,  
Honour and right and innocence.'  
Thus rose the cry of wild despair  
From spirits as they gathered there.  
In trembling troops in open lawns  
Wept, wild with woe, the startled fawns,  
And a strange terror changed the eyes  
They lifted to the distant skies.  
On silvan Gods who love the dell  
A sudden fear and trembling fell,  
As in the deepest woe they viewed  
The lady by the fiend subdued.  
Still in loud shrieks was heard afar  
That voice whose sweetness naught could  
mar,  
While eager looks of fear and woe  
She bent upon the earth below.  
The lady of each winning wile  
With pearly teeth and lovely smile,  
Seized by the lord of Lanká's isle,  
   Looked down for friends in vain.  
She saw no friend to aid her, none,  
Not Ráma nor the younger son  
Of Das'aratha, and undone  
   She swooned with fear and pain.
