### CANTO XXVII.: THE VÁNAR CHIEFS.

'Yet more remain, brave chiefs who stake  
Their noble lives for Ráma's sake.  
See, glorious, golden-coated, one  
Who glisters like the morning sun,  
Whom thousands of his race surround,  
'Tis Hara for his strength renowned,  
Next comes a mighty chieftain, he  
Whose legions, armed with rock and tree,  
Press on, in numbers passing tale,  
The ramparts of our town to scale.  
O Rávan, see the king advance  
Terrific with his fiery glance,  
Girt by the bravest of his train,  
Majestic as the God of Rain,  
Parjanya, when his host of clouds  
About the king, embattled, crowds:  
On Rikshaván's high mountain nursed,  
In Narmadá  <span id="fr_950"></span>[1b](#fn_950) he slakes his
thirst,  
Dhúmra, proud ursine chief, who leads  
Wild warriors whom the forest breeds.  
His brother, next in strength and age,  
In Jámbaván the famous sage.  
Of yore his might and skill he lent  
To him who rules the firmament,  
And Indra's liberal boons repaid  
The chieftain for the timely aid.  
There like a gloomy cloud that flies  
Borne by the tempest through the skies,  
Pramáthí stands: he roamed of yore  
The forest wilds on Gangá's shore,  
Where elephants were struck with dread  
And trembling at his coming fled.  
There on his foes he loved to sate  
The old hereditary hate.  <span id="fr_951"></span>[2b](#fn_951)  

<span id="page_449">p. 449</span>  

Look, Gaja and Gaváksha show  
Their lust of battle with the foe.  
See Nala burning for the fray,  
And Níla chafing at delay,  
Behind the eager captains press  
Wild hosts in numbers numberless,  
And each for Ráma's sake would fall  
Or force his way through Lanká's wall.'

Nerbudda.

<span id="fn_951"></span>[448:2b](ry426.htm#fr_951) According to a
Pauranik legend Kes'arí Hanúmán's putative father had killed an Asur or
demon who appeared in the <span id="page_449">p. 449</span> form of an
elephant, and hence arose the hostility between Vánars and elephants.
