### CANTO LXXXII.: THE DEPARTURE.

The prudent prince the assembly viewed  
Thronged with its noble multitude,  
Resplendent as a cloudless night  
When the full moon is in his height;  
While robes of every varied hue  
A glory o'er the synod threw.  
The priest in lore of duty skilled  
Looked on the crowd the hall that filled,  
And then in accents soft and grave  
To Bharat thus his counsel gave:  
'The king, dear son, so good and wise,  
Has gone from earth and gained the skies,  
Leaving to thee, her rightful lord,  
This rich wide land with foison stored.  
And still has faithful Ráma stood  
Firm to the duty of the good,  
And kept his father's host aright,  
As the moon keeps its own dear light.  
Thus sire and brother yield to thee  
This realm from all annoyance free:  
Bejoice thy lords: enjoy thine own:  
Anointed king, ascend the throne.  
Let vassal Princes hasten forth  
From distant lands, west, south, and north,  
From Kerala,  <span id="fr_360"></span>[3](#fn_360) from every sea,  
And bring ten million gems to thee.'  
As thus the sage Vas'ishtha spoke,  
A storm of grief o'er Bharat broke.  
And longing to he just and true,  

His thoughts to duteous Ráma flew.  
With sobs and sighs and broken tones,  
E'en as a wounded mallard moans,  
He mourned with deepest sorrow moved,  
And thus the holy priest reproved:  
'O, how can such as Bharat dare  
The power and sway from him to tear,  
Wise, and devout, and true, and chaste,  
With Scripture lore and virtue graced?  
Can one of Das'aratha's seed  
Be guilty of so vile a deed?  
The realm and I are Ráma's: thou,  
Shouldst speak the words of justice now.  
For he, to claims of virtue true,  
Is eldest born and noblest too:  
Nahush, Dilîpa could not be  
More famous in their lives than he.  
As Das'aratha ruled of right,  
So Ráma's is the power and right.  
If I should do this sinful deed  
And forfeit hope of heavenly need,  
My guilty act would dim the shine  
Of old Ikshváku's glorious line.  
Nay, as the sin my mother wrought  
Is grievous to my inmost thought,  
I here, my hands together laid,  
Will greet him in the pathless shade,  
To Ráma shall my steps be bent,  
My King, of men most excellent,  
Raghu's illustrious son, whose sway  
Might, hell, and earth, and heaven obey.'  
   That righteous speech, whose every word  
Bore virtue's, stamp, the audience heard;  
On Ráma every thought was set,  
And with glad tears each eye was wet.  
'Then, if the power I still should lack  
To bring my noble brother back,  
I in the wood will dwell, and share  
His banishment with Lakshman there.  
By every art persuasive I  
To bring him from the wood will try,  
And show him to your loving eyes.  
O Brahmans noble, good, and wise.  
E'en now, the road to make and clear,  
Each labourer pressed, and pioneer  
Have I sent forward to precede  
The army I resolve to lead.'  
   Thus, by fraternal love possessed,  
His firm resolve the prince expressed.  
Then to Sumantra, deeply read  
In holy texts, he turned and said:  
'Sumantra, rise without delay,  
And as I bid my words obey.  
Give orders for the march with speed,  
And all the army hither lead.'  
   The wise Sumantra, thus addressed,  
Obeyed the high-souled chief's behest.  
He hurried forth with joy inspired  
And gave the orders he desired.  
Delight each soldier's bosom filled,  
Aud through each chief and captain thrilled,  

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>  

To hear that march proclaimed, to bring  
Dear Ráma back from wandering.  
From house to house the tidings flew:  
Each soldier's wife the order knew,  
And as she listened blithe and gay  
Her husband urged to speed away.  
Captain and soldier soon declared  
The host equipped and all prepared  
With chariots matching thought for speed,  
And wagons drawn by ox and steed.  
When Bharat by Vás'ishtha's side,  
His ready host of warriors eyed,  
Thus in Sumantra's ear he spoke.:  
'My car and horses quickly yoke.'  
Sumantra hastened to fulfil  
With ready joy his master's will,  
And quickly with the chariot sped  
Drawn by fleet horses nobly bred.  
Then glorious Bharat, true, devout,  
Whose genuine valour none could doubt,  
Gave in fit words his order out;  
For he would seek the shade  
Of the great distant wood, and there  
Win his dear brother with his prayer:  
'Sumantra, haste! my will declare  
   The host be all arrayed.  
I to the wood my way will take,  
To Ráma supplication make,  
And for the world's advantage sake,  
   Will lead him home again.'  
Then, ordered thus, the charioteer  
Who listened with delighted ear,  
Went forth and gave his orders clear  
   To captains of the train.  
He gave the popular chiefs the word,  
And with the news his friends he stirred,  
And not a single man deferred  
   Preparing for the road.  
Then Bráhman, Warrior, Merchant, thrall,  
Obedient to Sumantra's call,  
Each in his house arose, and all  
Yoked elephant or camel tall,  
Or ass or noble steed in stall,  
   And full appointed showed.
