### CANTO XLVI.: THE CAPTAINS.

Mad with the rage of injured pride  
King Ráven summoned to his side  
The valiant \*\*\* who led his host,  
Supreme in war and honoured most.  
   'Go forth,' he cried, 'with car and steed,  
A\*\* \*\*\*\* feet this monkey lead.  
But watch each chance of time and place  
To seize this thing of silvan race.  
For from his wondrous exploits he  
No monkey of the woods can be,  

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>  

But some new kind of creature meant  
To work us woe, by Indra sent.  
Gandharvas, Nágas, and the best  
Of Yakshas have our might confessed.  
Have we not challenged and subdued  
The whole celestial multitude?  
Yet will you not, if you are wise,  
A chief of monkey race despise.  
For I myself have Báli known,  
And King Sugríva's power I own.  
But none of all their woodland throng  
Was half so terrible and strong.'  
   Obedient to the words he spake  
They hastened forth the foe to take.  
Swift were the cars whereon they rode,  
And bright their weapons flashed and glowed.  
They saw: they charged in wild career  
With sword and mace and axe and spear.  
From Durdhar's bow five arrows sped  
And quivered in the Vánar's head.  
He rose and roared; the fearful sound  
Made all the region echo round.  
Then from above his weight he threw  
On Durdhar's car that near him drew.  
The weight that came with lightning speed  
Crushed pole and axle, car and steed.  
It shattered Durdhar's head and neck,  
And left him lifeless mid the wreck.  
Yúpáksha saw the warrior die,  
And Virúpáksha heard his cry,  
And, mad for vengeance for the slain,  
They charged their Vánar foe again.  
He rose in air: they onward pressed  
And fiercely smote him on the breast.  
In vain they struck his iron frame:  
With eagle swoop to earth he came,  
Tore from the ground a tree that grew  
Beside him, and the demons slew.  
Then Bhásakama raised his spear,  
And Praghas with a laugh drew near,  
And, maddened at the sight, the two  
Against the undaunted Vánar flew.  
As from his wounds the torrents flowed,  
Like a red sun the Vánar showed.  
He turned, a mountain peak to seize  
With all its beasts and snakes and trees.  
He hurled it on the pair: and they  
Crushed, overwhelmed, beneath it lay.
