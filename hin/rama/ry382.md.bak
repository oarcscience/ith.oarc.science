### CANTO XLIV.: JAMBUMÁLI'S DEATH.

Then Jambumáli, pride and boast  
For valour of the Rákshas host,  
Prahasta's son supremely brave.  
Obeyed the hest that Rávan gave:  
Fierce warrior with terrific teeth,  
With saguine robes and brilliant wreath.  
A bow like Indra's own  <span id="fr_881"></span>[2b](#fn_881.md), and
store  

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>  

Of glittering shafts the chieftain bore.  
And ever as the string he \*\*tried  
The weapon with a roar replied,  
Loud as the crashing thunder sent  
By him who rules the firmament.  
Soon as the foeman came in view  
Borne on a car which asses drew.  
The Vánar chieftain mighty-voiced  
Shouted in triumph and rejoiced.  
Prahasta's son his bow-string drew,  
And swift the winged arrows flew.  
One in the face the Vánar smote,  
Another quivered in his throat.  
Ten from the deadly weapon sent  
His brawny aims and shoulders rent.  
Then as he felt each galling shot  
The Vánar's rage waxed fiercely hot.  
He looked, and saw a mass of stone  
That lay before his feet o'erthrown.  
The mighty block he raised and threw,  
And crashing through the air it flew.  
But Jambumah shunned the blow,  
And rained fresh arrows from his bow.  
The Vánar's limbs were red with gore:  
A Sál tree from the earth he tore,  
And, ere he hurled it undismayed,  
Above his head the missile swayed.  
But shafts from Jambumah's bow  
Cut through it ere his hand could throw.  
And thigh and arm and chest and side  
With streams of rushing blood were dyed.  
Still unsubdued though wounded oft  
The shattered trunk he raised aloft,  
And down with well-directed aim  
On Jambumah's chest it came.  
There crushed upon the trampled grass  
He lay an undistinguished mass,  
The foeman's eye no more could see  
His head or chest or arm or knee.  
And bow and car and steeds <span
id="fr_882"></span>[1](ry383.htm#fn_882.md) and store  
Of glittering; shafts were seen no more.  
   When Jambumah's death he heard,  
King Rávan's heart with rage was stirred  
And forth his general's sons he sent,  
For power and might preeminent.
