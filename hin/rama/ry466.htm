<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXX.: THE DEATH OF TRIS'IRAS.</H3>
<P>
Then raged the R&aacute;kshas chiefs, and all<BR>
Burned to avenge Nar&aacute;ntak's fall.<BR>
Dev&aacute;ntak raised his club on high<BR>
And rushed at Angad with a cry.<BR>
Behind came Tris'iras, and near<BR>
Mahodar charged with levelled spear.<BR>
There Angad stood to fight with three:<BR>
High o'er his head he waved a tree,<BR>
And at Dev&aacute;ntak, swift and true<BR>
As Indra's flaming bolt, it flew.<BR>
But, cut by giant shafts in twain,<BR>
With minished force it flew in vain.<BR>
A shower of trees and blocks of stone<BR>
From Angad's hand was fiercely thrown;<BR>
But well his club Dev&aacute;ntak plied<BR>
And turned each rock and tree aside.<BR>
Nor yet, by three such foes assailed,<BR>

<P>
The heart of Angad sank or quailed.<BR>
He slew the mighty beast that bore<BR>
Mahodar: from his head he tore<BR>
A bleeding tusk, and blow on blow<BR>
Fell fiercely on his R&aacute;kshas foe.<BR>
The giant reeled, but strength regained,<BR>
And furious strokes on Angad rained,<BR>
Who, wounded by the storm of blows,<BR>
Sank on his knees, but swiftly rose.<BR>
Then Tris'iras, as up he sprang,<BR>
Drew his great bow with awful clang,<BR>
And fixed three arrows from his sheaf<BR>
Full in the forehead of the chief.<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n saw, nor long delayed<BR>
To speed with N&iacute;la to his aid,<BR>
Who at the three-faced giant sent<BR>
A peak from Lank&aacute;'s mountain rent.<BR>
But Tris'iras with certain aim<BR>
Shot rapid arrows as it came:<BR>
And shivered by their force it broke<BR>
And fell to earth with flash and smoke.<BR>
Then as the Wind-God's son came nigh,<BR>
Dev&aacute;ntak reared his mace on high.<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n smote him on the head<BR>
And stretched the monstrous giant dead.<BR>
Fierce Tris'iras with fury strained<BR>
His bow, and showers of arrows rained<BR>
That smote on N&iacute;la's side and chest:<BR>
He sank a moment, sore distressed;<BR>
But quickly gathered strength to seize<BR>
A mountain with its crown of trees.<BR>
Crushed by the hill, distained with gore,<BR>
Mahodar fell to rise no more.<BR>

<P>
Then Tris'iras raised high his spear<BR>
Which chilled the trembling foe with fear<BR>
And, like a flashing meteor through<BR>
The air at Han&uacute;m&aacute;n it flew.<BR>
The V&aacute;nar shunned the threatened stroke,<BR>
And with strong hands the weapon broke.<BR>
The giant drew his glittering blade:<BR>
Dire was the wound the weapon made<BR>
Deep in the V&aacute;nar's ample chest,<BR>
Who, for a moment sore oppressed,<BR>
Raised his broad hand, regaining might,<BR>
And struck the rover of the night.<BR>
Fierce was the blow: with one wild yell<BR>
Low on the earth the monster fell,<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n seized his fallen sword<BR>
Which served no more its senseless lord,<BR>
And from the monger triple-necked<BR>
Smote his huge heads with crowns bedecked.<BR>
Then Mah&aacute;p&aacute;rs'va burned with ire;<BR>
Fierce flashed his eyes with vengeful fire.<BR>
A moment on the dead he gazed,<BR>
Then his black mace aloft was raised,<BR>
And down the mass of iron came<BR>
That struck and shook the V&aacute;nar's frame.<BR>
Han&uacute;m&aacute;n's chest was wellnigh crushed,<BR>
And from his mouth red torrents gushed:<BR>
Yet served one instant to restore<BR>

<P>
His spirit: from the foe he tore<BR>
His awful mace, and smote, and laid<BR>
The giant in the dust dismayed.<BR>
Crushed were his jaws and teeth and eyes:<BR>
Breathless and still he lay as lies<BR>
A summit from a mountain rent<BR>
By him who rules the firmament.<BR>
