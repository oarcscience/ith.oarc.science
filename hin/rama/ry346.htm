<P>
There from the circling rampart's height<BR>
He gazed upon the wondrous sight;<BR>
Broad gates with burnished gold displayed,<BR>
And courts with turkises inlaid;<BR>
With gleaming silver, gems, and rows<BR>
Of crystal stairs and porticoes.<BR>
In semblance of a Rakshas dame<BR>
The city's guardian Goddess came,--<BR>
For she with glances sure and keen<BR>
The entrance of a foe had seen,--<BR>
And thus with fury in her eye<BR>
Addressed him with an angry cry:<BR>
'Who art thou? what has led thee, say,<BR>
Within these walls to find thy way?<BR>
Thou mayst not enter here in spite<BR>
Of Ravan and his warriors' might.<BR>
'And who art thou?' the Vanar cried,<BR>
By form and frown unterrified,<BR>
'Why hast thou met me by the gate,<BR>
And chid me thus infuriate?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased: andd Lanka made reply:<BR>
'The guardian of the town am I,<BR>
Who watch for ever to fulfil<BR>
My lord the Rakshas monarch's will.<BR>
But thou shalt fall this hour, and deep<BR>
Shall be thy never-ending sleep.<BR>
Again he spake:'In spite of thee<BR>
This golden city will I see.<BR>
Her gates and towers, and all the pride<BR>
Of street and square from side to side,<BR>
And freely wander where I please<BR>
Amid her groves of flowering trees;<BR>
On all her beauties sate mine eye.<BR>
Then, as I came, will homeward hie.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Swift with an angry roar she smote<BR>
With her huge hand the Vanar's throat.<BR>
The smitten Vanar, rage-impelled,<BR>
With fist upraised the monster felled:<BR>
But quick repented, stirred with shame<BR>
And pity for a vanquished dame,<BR>
When with her senses troubled, weak<BR>
With terror, thus she strove to speak:<BR>
'O spare me thou whose arm is strong:<BR>
O spare me, and forgive the wrong.<BR>

<P>

<P>
The brave that law will ne'er transgress<BR>
That spares a woman's helplessness.<BR>
Hear, best of Vanars, brave and bold,<BR>
What Brahma's self of yore foretold;<BR>
'Beware,' he said, 'the fatal hour<BR>
When tbou shalt own a Vanar's power.<BR>
Then is the giants' day of fear,<BR>
For terror and defeat are near.'<BR>
Now, Vanar chief, o'ercome by thee,<BR>
I own the truth of heaven's decree.<BR>
For Sita's sake will ruin fall<BR>
On Ravan, and his town, and all.'<BR>
