<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXV.: THE BATTLE.</H3>
<P>
When Khara with the hosts he led<BR>
Drew near to R&aacute;ma's leafy shed,<BR>
He saw that queller of the foe<BR>
Stand ready with his ordered bow.<BR>
He saw, and burning at the view<BR>
His clanging bow he raised and drew,<BR>
And bade his driver urge apace<BR>
His car to meet him face to face.<BR>
Obedient to his master's hest<BR>
His eager steeds the driver pressed<BR>
On to the spot where, none to aid,<BR>
The strong-armed chief his weapon swayed.<BR>
Soon as the children of the night<BR>
Saw Khara rushing to the fight,<BR>

<P>
His lords with loud unearthly cry<BR>
Followed their chief and gathered nigh.<BR>
As in his car the leader rode<BR>
With all his lords around, he showed<BR>
Like the red planet fiery Mars<BR>
Surrounded by the lesser stars.<BR>
Then with a horrid yell that rent<BR>
The air, the giant chieftain sent<BR>
A thousand darts in rapid shower<BR>
On R&aacute;ma matchless in his power.<BR>
The rovers of the night, impelled<BR>
By fiery rage which naught withheld,<BR>
Upon the unconquered prince, who strained<BR>
His fearful bow, their arrows rained.<BR>
With sword and club, with mace and pike,<BR>
With spear and axe to pierce and strike,<BR>
Those furious fiends on every side<BR>
The unconquerable hero plied.<BR>
The giant legions huge and strong,<BR>
Like clouds the tempest drives along,<BR>
Rushed upon R&aacute;ma with the speed<BR>
Of whirling car, and mounted steed,<BR>
And hill-like elephant, to slay<BR>
The matchless prince in battle fray.<BR>
Then upon R&aacute;ma thick and fast<BR>
The rain of mortal steel they cast,<BR>
As labouring clouds their torrents shed<BR>
Upon the mountain-monarch's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_468"></A><A HREF="#fn_468"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> head.<BR>
As near and nearer round him drew<BR>
The warriors of the giant crew,<BR>
He showed like S'iva girt by all<BR>
His spirits when night's shadows fall.<BR>
As the great deep receives each rill<BR>
And river rushing from the hill,<BR>
He bore that flood of darts, and broke<BR>
With well-aimed shaft each murderous stroke.<BR>
By stress of arrowy storm assailed,<BR>
And wounded sore, he never failed,<BR>
Like some high mountain which defies<BR>
The red bolts flashing from the skies.<BR>
With ruddy streams each limb was dyed<BR>
From gaping wounds in breast and side,<BR>
Showing the hero like the sun<BR>
'Mid crimson clouds ere day is done.<BR>
Then, at that sight of terror, faint<BR>
Grew God, Gandharva, sage, and saint,<BR>
Trembling to see the prince oppose<BR>
His single might to myriad foes.<BR>
But waxing wroth, with force unspent,<BR>
He strained his bow to utmost bent,<BR>
And forth his arrows keen and true<BR>
In hundreds, yea in thousands flew,--<BR>
Shafts none could ward, and none endure:<BR>
Death's fatal noose was scarce so sure.<BR>
As 'twere in playful ease he shot<BR>
His gilded shafts, and rested not.<BR>
With swiftest flight and truest aim<BR>
Upon the giant hosts they came.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Each smote, each stayed a foeman's breath<BR>
As fatal as the coil of Death,<BR>
Each arrow through a giant tore<BR>
A passage, and besmeared with gore,<BR>
Pursued its onward way and through<BR>
The air with flamy brilliance flew.<BR>
Unnumbered were the arrows sent<BR>
From the great bow which R&aacute;ma bent,<BR>
And every shaft with iron head<BR>
The lifeblood of a giant shed.<BR>
Their pennoned bows were cleft, nor mail<BR>
Nor shield of hide could aught avail.<BR>
For R&aacute;ma's myriad arrows tore<BR>
Through arms, and bracelets which they wore,<BR>
And severed mighty warriors' thighs<BR>
Like trunks of elephants in size,<BR>
And cut resistless passage sheer<BR>
Through gold-decked horse and charioteer,<BR>
Slew elephant and rider, slew<BR>
The horseman and the charger too,<BR>
And infantry unnumbered sent<BR>
To dwell 'neath Yama's government.<BR>
Then rose on high a fearful yell<BR>
Of rovers of the night, who fell<BR>
Beneath that iron torrent, sore<BR>
Wounded by shafts that rent and tore.<BR>
So mangled by the ceaseless storm<BR>
Of shafts of every kind and form,<BR>
Such joy they found, as forests feel<BR>
When scorched by flame, from R&aacute;ma's steel.<BR>
The mightiest still the fight maintained,<BR>
And furious upon R&aacute;ma rained<BR>
Dart, arrow, spear, with wild attacks<BR>
Of mace, and club, and battle-axe.<BR>
But the great chief, unconquered yet,<BR>
Their weapons with his arrows met,<BR>
Which severed many a giant's head,<BR>
And all the plain with corpses spread.<BR>
With sundered bow and shattered shield<BR>
Headless they sank upon the field,<BR>
As the tall trees, that felt the blast<BR>
Of Garud's wing, to earth were cast.<BR>
The giants left unslaughtered there<BR>
Where filled with terror and despair,<BR>
And to their leader Khara fled<BR>
Faint, wounded, and discomfited.<BR>
These fiery D&uacute;shan strove to cheer,<BR>
And poised his bow to calm their fear;<BR>
Then fierce as He who rules the dead,<BR>
When wroth, on angered R&aacute;ma sped.<BR>
By D&uacute;shan cheered, the demons cast<BR>
Their dread aside and rallied fast<BR>
With S&aacute;ls, rocks, palm-trees in their hands<BR>
With nooses, maces, pikes, and brands,<BR>
Again upon the godlike man<BR>
The mighty fiends infuriate ran,<BR>
These casting rocks like hail, and these<BR>
A whelming shower of leafy trees.<BR>
Wild, wondrous fight, the eye to scare,<BR>
And raise on end each shuddering hair,<BR>

As with the fiends who loved to rove<BR>
By night heroic R&aacute;ma strove!<BR>
The giants in their fury plied<BR>
R&aacute;ma with darts on every side.<BR>
Then, by the gathering demons pressed<BR>
From north and south and east and west,<BR>
By showers of deadly darts assailed<BR>
From every quarter fiercely hailed,<BR>
Girt by the foes who swarmed around,<BR>
He raised a mighty shout whose sound<BR>
Struck terror. On the giant crew<BR>
His great G&aacute;ndharva&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_469"></A><A HREF="ry224.htm#fn_469"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> arrow flew.<BR>
A thousand mortal shafts were rained<BR>
From the orbed bow the hero strained,<BR>
Till east and west and south and north<BR>
Were filled with arrows volleyed forth.<BR>
They heard the fearful shout: they saw<BR>
His mighty hand the bowstring draw,<BR>
Yet could no wounded giant's eye<BR>
See the swift storm of arrows fly.<BR>
Still firm the warrior stood and cast<BR>
His deadly missiles thick and fast.<BR>
Dark grew the air with arrowy hail<BR>
Which hid the sun as with a veil.<BR>
Fiends wounded, falling, fallen, slain,<BR>
All in a moment, spread the plain,<BR>
And thousands scarce alive were left<BR>
Mangled, and gashed, and torn, and cleft.<BR>
Dire was the sight, the plain o'erspread<BR>
With trophies of the mangled dead.<BR>
There lay, by R&aacute;ma's missiles rent,<BR>
Full many a priceless ornament,<BR>
With severed limb and broken gem,<BR>
Hauberk and helm and diadem.<BR>
There lay the shattered car, the steed,<BR>
The elephant of noblest breed,<BR>
The splintered spear, the shivered mace,<BR>
Chouris and screens to shade the face.<BR>
The giants saw with bitterest pain<BR>
Their warriors weltering on the plain,<BR>
Nor dared again his might oppose<BR>
Who scourged the cities of his foes.<BR>
