### CANTO XII.: THE PALM TREES.

Then Ráma, that his friend might know  
His strength unrivalled, grasped his bow,  
That mighty bow the foe's dismay,--  
And on the string an arrow lay.  
Next on the tree his eye he bent,  
And forth the hurtling weapon went.  
Loosed from the matchless hero's hold,  
That arrow, decked with burning gold,  
Cleft the seven palms in line, and through  
The hill that rose behind them flew:  

Six subterranean realms it passed,  
And reached the lowest depth at last,  
Whence speeding back through earth and air  
It sought the quiver, and rested there.  <span
id="fr_574"></span>[1](#fn_574.md)  
Upon the cloven trees amazed.  
The sovereign of the Vánars gazed.  
With all his chains and gold outspread  
Prostrate on earth he laid his head.  
Then, rising, palm to palm he laid  
In reverent act, obeisance made,  
And joyously to Ráma, best  
Of war-trained chiefs, these words addressed:  
   'What champion, Raghu's son, may hope  
With thee in deadly fight to cope,  
Whose arrow, leaping from the bow.  
Cleaves tree and hill and earth below?  
Scarce might the Gods, arrayed for strife  
By Indra's self, escape, with life  
Assailed by thy victorious hand:  
And how may Báli hope to stand?  
All grief and care are past away,  
And joyous thoughts my bosom sway,  
Who have in thee a friend, renowned.  
As Varun  <span id="fr_575"></span>[2](#fn_575.md) or as Indra, found.  
Then on! subdue,--'tis friendship's claim,--  
My foe who bears a brother's name.  
Strike Báli down beneath thy feet:  
With suppliant hands I thus entreat,'  
Sugríva ceased, and Ráma pressed  
The grateful Vánar to his breast;  
And thoughts of kindred feeling woke  
In Lakshman's bosom, as he spoke:  
'On to Kishkindhá, on with speed!  
Thou, Vánar King, our way shalt lead,  
Then challenge Báli forth to fight.  
Thy foe who scorns a brother's right.'  
   They sought Kishkindhá's gate and stood  
Concealed by trees in densest wood,  
Sugríva, to the fight addressed,  
More closely drew his cinctured vest,  
And raised a wild sky-piercing shout  

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>  

To call the foeman Báli out.  
Forth came impetuous Báli, stirred  
To fury by the shout he heard.  
So the great sun, ere night has ceased,  
Springs up impatient to the east.  
Then fierce and wild the conflict raged  
As hand to hand the foes engaged,  
As though in battle mid the stars  
Fought Mercury and fiery Mars.  <span id="fr_576"></span>[1](#fn_576.md)  
To highest pitch of frenzy wrought  
With fists like thunderbolts they fought,  
While near them Ráma took his stand,  
And viewed the battle, bow in hand.  
Alike they stood in form and might,  
Like heavenly As'vins  <span id="fr_577"></span>[2](#fn_577.md) paired in
fight,  
Nor might the son of Raghu know  
Where fought the friend and where the foe;  
So, while his bow was ready bent.  
No life-destroying shaft he sent.  
Crushed down by Báli's mightier stroke  
Sugríva's force now sank and broke,  
Who, hoping naught from Ráma's aid,  
To Rishyamúka fled dismayed,  
Weary, and faint, and wounded sore,  
His body bruised and dyed with gore,  
From Báli's blows, in rage and dread,  
Afar to sheltering woods he fled.  
   Nor Báli farther dared pursue,  
The curbing curse too well he knew.  
'Fled from thy death!' the victor cried,  
And home the mighty warrior hied.  
Hanúmán, Lakshman, Raghu's son  
Beheld the conquered Vánar run.  
And followed to the sheltering shade  
Where yet Sugríva stood dismayed.  
Near and more near the chieftains came,  
Then, for intolerable shame,  
Not daring yet to lift his eyes,  
Sugríva spoke with burning sighs:  
'Thy matchless strength I first beheld,  
And dared my foe, by thee impelled.  
Why hast thou tried me with deceit  
And urged me to a sure defeat?  

Thou shouldst have said, 'I will not slay  
Thy foeman in the coming fray.'  
For had I then thy purpose known  
I had not waged the fight alone.'  
   The Vánar sovereign, lofty-souled,  
In plaintive voice his sorrows told.  
Then Ráma spake: 'Sugríva, list,  
All anger from thy heart dismissed,  
And I will tell the cause that stayed  
Mine arrow, and withheld the aid.  
In dress, adornment, port, and height,  
In splendour, battle-shout, and might,  
No shade of difference could I see  
Between thy foe, O King, and thee.  
So like was each, I stood at gaze,  
My senses lost in wildering maze,  
Nor loosened from my straining bow  
A deadly arrow at the foe,  
Lest in my doubt the shaft should send  
To sudden death our surest friend.  
O, if this hand in heedless guilt  
And rash resolve thy blood had spilt,  
Through every land, O Vánar King,  
My wild and foolish act would ring,  
Sore weight of sin on him must lie  
By whom a friend is made to die;  
And Lakshman, I, and Sítá, best  
Of dames, on thy protection rest.  
On, warrior! for the fight prepare;  
Nor fear again thy foe to dare.  
Within one hour thine eye shall view  
My arrow strike thy foeman through;  
Shall see the stricken Báli lie  
Low on the earth, and gasp and die.  
But come, a badge about thee bind,  
O monarch of the Vánar kind.  
That in the battle shock mine eyes  
The friend and foe may recognize.  
Come, Lakshman, let that creeper deck  
With brightest bloom Sugríva's neck,  
And be a happy token, twined  
Around the chief of lofty mind.'  
   Upon the mountain slope there grew  
A threading creeper fair to view,  
And Lakshman plucked the bloom and round  
Sugríva's neck a garland wound,  
Graced with the flowery wreath he wore,  
The Vánar chief the semblance bore  
Of a dark cloud at close of day  
Engarlanded with cranes at play,  
In glorious light the Vánar glowed  
As by his comrade's side he strode.  
And, still on Ráma's word intent,  
His steps to great Kishkindhá bent.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_574"></span>[338:1](ry286.htm#fr_574.md) The Bengal recension
makes it return In the form of a swan.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[338:2](ry286.htm#fr_575.md) Varuna is one of the
oldest of the Vedic Gods, corresponding in name and partly in character
to the οὐρανός of the Greeks and is often regarded as the supreme deity.
He upholds heaven and earth, possesses extraordinary power and wisdom,
sends his messengers through both worlds, numbers the very winkings of
men's eyes, punishes transgressors whom he seizes with his deadly noose,
and pardons the sins of those who are penitent. In later mythology he
has become the God of the sea.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[339:1](ry286.htm#fr_576.md) Budha, not to be
confounded with the great reformer Buddha, is the son of Soma or the
Moon, and regent of the planet Mercury. Angára is the regent of Mars who
is called the red or the fiery planet. The encounter between Michael and
Satan is similarly said to have been as if

  
   "Two planets rushing from aspect malign  
   Of fiercest opposition in midsky  
   Should combat, and their jarring spheres  
   compound."  

*Paradise Lost.* Book VI.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[339:2](ry286.htm#fr_577.md) The As'vins or
Heavenly Twins, the Dioskuri or Castor and Pollux of the Hindus, have
frequently been mentioned. See p. 36, Note
