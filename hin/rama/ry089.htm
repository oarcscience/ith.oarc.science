<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XI.: THE QUEEN'S DEMAND.</H3>
<P>
To him enthralled by love, and blind,<BR>

<P>
Pierced by his darts who shake the mind,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Kaikeyi with remorseless breast<BR>

<P>
Her grand purpose thus expressed:<BR>
"O King, no insult or neglect<BR>
Have I endured, or disrespect.<BR>
One wish I have, and faith would soe<BR>
That longing granted, laid, by thee.<BR>
Now pledge thy word if thou incline<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>
To listen to this prayer of mine,<BR>
Then I with confidence will speak,<BR>
And thou shalt hear the boon I seek.'<BR>

<P>
Ere she had ceased, the monarch fell,<BR>
A victim to the lady's spell,<BR>
And to the deadly snare she set<BR>
Sprang, like a roebuck to the net.<BR>
Her lover raised her drooping head,<BR>
Smiled, playing with her hair, and said:<BR>
'Hast thou not learnt, wild dame, till now<BR>
That there is none so dear as thou'<BR>
To me thy loving husband, save<BR>
My Rama bravest of the brave!<BR>
By him my race's high-souled heir,<BR>
By him whom none can match, I swear,<BR>
Now speak the wish that on thee weighs:<BR>
By him whose right is length of days,<BR>
Whom if my fond paternal eye<BR>
Saw not one hour I needs must die,--<BR>
I swear by Rama myd ear son,<BR>
Speak, and thy bidding shall be done.<BR>
Speak, darling; if thou choose, request<BR>
To have the heart from out my breast;<BR>
Regard my words, sweet love, and name<BR>
The wish thy mind thinks fit to frame.<BR>
Nor let shy soul give way to doubt:<BR>
My power should drive suspicion out.<BR>
Yea, by my merits won I swear,<BR>
Speak, darling, I will grant thy prayer,'<BR>

<P>
The queen, ambitious, overjoyed<BR>
To see him by her plot decoyed.<BR>
More eager still her aims to reach,<BR>
Spoke her abominable speech:<BR>
'A boon thou grantest, nothing loth,<BR>
And swearest with repeated oath.<BR>
Now let the thirty Gods and three<BR>
My witnesses, with Indra, be.<BR>
Let sun and moon and planets hear,<BR>
Heaven, quarters, day and night, give ear.<BR>
The mighty world, the earth outspread,<BR>
With birds of heaven and demons regard;<BR>
The ghosts that walk in midnight shade,<BR>
And household Gods, our present aid,<BR>
A every being great and small<BR>
To hear and mark the oath I call.'<BR>

<P>
When this the archer king was bound,<BR>
With treacherous arts and oaths unwound,<BR>
She to her beauteous lord subdued,<BR>
By blinding love, her speech renewed:<BR>
'Rememer, King, that long-past day<BR>
Of Gods' and demons' battle fray.<BR>
And how thy foe in doubtful strife<BR>
Had nigh bereft thee of thy life.<BR>
Remember, it was only I<BR>
Preserved thee when about to die,<BR>
And thou for watchful love and care<BR>
Wouldst grant my first aud second prayer.<BR>
Those offered boons, pledged with thee then,<BR>
I now demand, O King of men,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Of thee, O Monarch, good and just,<BR>
Whose righteous soul observes each trust.<BR>
If thou refuse thy promise sworn,<BR>
I die, despised, before the morn.<BR>
These rites in R&aacute;ma's name begun<BR>
Transfer them, and enthrone my son.<BR>
The time is come to claim at last<BR>
The double boon of days long-past,<BR>
When Gods and demons met in fight.<BR>
And thou wouldst fain my care requite.<BR>
Now forth to Dandak's forest drive<BR>
Thy R&aacute;ma for nine years and five,<BR>
And let him dwell a hermit there<BR>
With deerskin coat and matted hair.<BR>
Without a rival let my boy<BR>
The empire of the land enjoy,<BR>
And let mine eyes ere morning see<BR>
Thy R&aacute;ma to the forest flee.'<BR>
