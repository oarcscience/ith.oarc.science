<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XCII.: BHARAT'S FAREWELL.</H3>
<P>
So Bharat with his army spent<BR>
The watches of the night content,<BR>

<P>

<P>
And gladly, with the morning's light<BR>
Drew near his host the anchorite.<BR>
When Bharadv&aacute;ja saw him stand<BR>
With hand in reverence joined to hand,<BR>
When fires of worship had been fed,<BR>
He looked upon the prince and said:<BR>
'O blameless son, I pray thee tell,<BR>
Did the past night content thee well?<BR>
Say if the feast my care supplied<BR>
Thy host of followers gratified.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His hands he joined, his head he bent<BR>
And spoke in answer reverent<BR>
To the most high and radiant sage<BR>
Who issued from his hermitage:<BR>
'Well have I passed the night: thy feast<BR>
Gave joy to every man and beast;<BR>
And I, great lord, and every peer<BR>
Were satisfied with sumptuous cheer,<BR>
Thy banquet has delighted all<BR>
From highest chief to meanest thrall,<BR>
And rich attire and drink and meat<BR>
Banished the thought of toil and heat,<BR>
And now, O Hermit good and great,<BR>
A boon of thee I supplicate.<BR>
To R&aacute;ma's side my steps I bend:<BR>
Do thou with friendly eye commend.<BR>
O tell me how to guide my feet<BR>
To virtuous R&aacute;ma's lone retreat:<BR>
Great Hermit, I entreat thee, say<BR>
How far from here and which the way.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus by fraternal love inspired<BR>
The chieftain of the saint inquired:<BR>
Then thus replied the glorious seer<BR>
Of matchless might, of vows austere:<BR>
'Ere the fourth league from here be passed,<BR>
Amid a forest wild and vast,<BR>
Stands Chitrak&uacute;ta's mountain tall,<BR>
Lovely with wood and waterfall.<BR>
North of the mountain thou wilt see<BR>
The beauteous stream Mand&aacute;kin&iacute;,<BR>
Where swarm the waterfowl below.<BR>
And gay trees on the margin grow.<BR>
Then will a leafy cot between<BR>
The river and the hill be seen:<BR>
'Tis R&aacute;ma's, and the princely pair<BR>
Of brothers live for certain there.<BR>
Hence to the south thine army lead,<BR>
And then more southward still proceed.<BR>
So shall thou find his lone retreat,<BR>
And there the son of Raghu meet.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Soon as the ordered march they knew,<BR>
The widows of the monarch flew,<BR>
Leaving their cars, most meet to ride,<BR>
And flocked to Bharadv&aacute;ja's side.<BR>
There with the good Sumitr&aacute; Queen<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;, sad and worn, was seen,<BR>
Caressing, still with sorrow faint,<BR>
The feet of that illustrious saint,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute; too, her longings crossed,<BR>
Reproached of all, her object lost,<BR>
Before the famous hermit came,<BR>

<P>

<P>
And clasped his feet, overwhelmed with shame.<BR>
With circling steps she humbly went<BR>
Around the saint pre&euml;minent,<BR>
And stood not far from Bharat's side<BR>
With heart oppressed, and heavy-eyed.<BR>
Then the great seer, who never broke<BR>
One holy vow, to Bharat spoke:<BR>
'Speak, Raghu's son: I fain would learn<BR>
The story of each queen in turn.'<BR>

<P>
Obedient to the high request<BR>
By Bharadv&aacute;ja thus addressed,<BR>
His reverent hands together laid,<BR>
He, skilled in speech, his answer made:<BR>
'She whom, O Saint, thou seest here<BR>
A Goddess in her form appear,<BR>
Was the chief consort of the king,<BR>
Now worn with fast and sorrowing.<BR>
As Aditi in days of yore<BR>
The all-preserving Vishnu bore,<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute; bore with happy fate<BR>
Lord R&aacute;ma of the lion's gait.<BR>
She who, transfixed with torturing pangs,<BR>
On her left arm so fondly hangs,<BR>
As when her withering leaves decay<BR>
Droops by the wood the Cassia spray,<BR>
Sumitr&aacute;, pained with woe, is she,<BR>
The consort second of the three:<BR>
Two princely sons the lady bare,<BR>
Fair as the Gods in heaven are fair.<BR>
And she, the wicked dame through whom<BR>
My brothers' lives are wrapped in gloom,<BR>
And mourning for his offspring dear,<BR>
The king has sought his heavenly sphere,--<BR>
Proud, foolish-hearted, swift to ire,<BR>
Self-fancied darling of my sire,<BR>
Kaikey&iacute;, most ambitious queen,<BR>
Unlovely with her lovely mien,<BR>
My mother she, whose impious will<BR>
Is ever bent on deeds of ill,<BR>
In whom the root and spring I see<BR>
Of all this woe which crushes me.'<BR>

<P>
Quick breathing like a furious snake,<BR>
With tears and sobs the hero spake,<BR>
With reddened eyes aglow with rage.<BR>
And Bharadv&aacute;ja, mighty sage,<BR>
Supreme in wisdom, calm and grave,<BR>
In words like these good counsel gave:<BR>
'O Bharat, hear the words I say;<BR>
On her the fault thou must not lay:<BR>
For many a blessing yet will spring<BR>
From banished R&aacute;ma's wandering.'<BR>
And Bharat, with that promise cheered,<BR>
Went circling round that saint revered.<BR>
He humbly bade farewell, and then<BR>
Gave orders to collect his men.<BR>
Prompt at the summons thousands flew<BR>
To cars which noble coursers drew,<BR>
Bright-gleaming, glorious to behold,<BR>
Adorned with wealth of burnished gold.<BR>
Then female elephants and male,<BR>
Gold-girthed, with flags that wooed the gale,<BR>
Marched with their bright bells' tinkling chime<BR>
Like clouds when ends the summer time:<BR>
Some cars were huge and some were light,<BR>
For heavy draught or rapid flight,<BR>
Of costly price, of every kind,<BR>
With clouds of infantry behind.<BR>
The dames, Kaus'aly&aacute; at their head,<BR>
Were in the noblest chariots led,<BR>
And every gentle bosom beat<BR>
With hope the banished prince to meet.<BR>
The royal Bharat, glory-crowned,<BR>
With all his retinue around,<BR>
Borne in a beauteous litter rode,<BR>
Like the young moon and sun that glowed.<BR>
The army as it streamed along,<BR>
Cars, elephants, in endless throng,<BR>
Showed, marching on its southward way,<BR>
Like autumn clouds in long array.<BR>
