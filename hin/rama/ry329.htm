<P>
These V&aacute;nar hosts with one accord<BR>
Will quit thee for their lawful lord,<BR>
And turn again with thirsty eyes<BR>
To wife and babe and all they prize.<BR>
Thou in the lonely cavern left<BR>
Of followers and friends bereft,<BR>
Wilt be in all thy woe, alas,<BR>
Weak as a blade of trembling grass:<BR>
And Lakshman's arrows, keen and fierce<BR>
From his strong bow, thy heart will pierce.<BR>
But if in lowly reverence meek<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va's court with us thou seek,<BR>
He, as thy birth demands, will share<BR>
The kingdom with the royal heir.<BR>
Thy loving kinsman, true and wise,<BR>
Looks on thee still with favouring eyes.<BR>
Firm in his promise, pure is he,<BR>
And ne'er will vex or injure thee.<BR>
He loves thy mother, lives for her<BR>
A faithful friend and worshipper.<BR>
That mother's love thou mayst not spurn:<BR>
Her only child, return, return.'<BR>
