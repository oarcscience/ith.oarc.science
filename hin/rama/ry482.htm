<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO CXI.: VIBH&Iacute;SHAN'S LAMENT.</H3>
<P>
Vibh&iacute;shan saw his brother slain,<BR>
Nor could his heart its woe contain.<BR>
O'er the dead king he sadly bent<BR>
And mourned him with a loud lament:<BR>
'O hero, bold and brave.' he cried,<BR>
'Skilled in all arms, in battle tried.<BR>
Spoiled of thy crown, with limbs outspread.<BR>

<P>
Why wilt thou press thy gory bed?<BR>
Why slumber on the earth's cold breast,<BR>
When sumptuous couches woo to rest?<BR>
Ah me, my brother over bold,<BR>
Thine is the fate my heart foretold:<BR>
But love and pride forbade to hear<BR>
The friend who blamed thy wild career.<BR>
Fallen is the sun who gave us light,<BR>
Our lordly moon is veiled in night.<BR>
Our beacon fire is dead and cold<BR>
A hundred waves have o'er it rolled.<BR>
What could his light and fire avail<BR>
Against Lord R&aacute;ma's arrowy hail?<BR>
Woe for the giants' royal tree,<BR>
Whose stately height was fair to see.<BR>
His buds were deeds of kingly grace,<BR>
His bloom the sons who decked his race.<BR>
With rifled bloom and mangled bough<BR>
The royal tree lies prostrate now.'<BR>
'Nay, idly mourn not," R&aacute;ma cried,<BR>
'The warrior king has nobly died,<BR>
Interpid hero, firm through all.<BR>
So fell he as the brave should fall;<BR>
And ill beseems it chiefs like us<BR>
To weep for those who perish thus.<BR>
Be firm: thy causeless grief restrain,<BR>
And pay the dues that yet remain,<BR>

<P>
Again Vibh&iacute;shan sadly spoke:<BR>
'His was the hero arm that broke<BR>
Embattled Gods' and Indra's might,<BR>
Unconquered ere to-day in fight.<BR>
He rushed against thee, fought and fell,<BR>
As Ocean, when his waters swell,<BR>
Hurling his might against a rock,<BR>
Falls spent and shattered by the shock<BR>
Woe for our king's untimely end,<BR>
The generous lord the trusty friend:<BR>
Our sure defence when fear arose,<BR>
A dreaded scourge to stubborn foes.<BR>
O, let the king thy hand has slain<BR>
The honours of the dead obtain.'<BR>

<P>
Then R&aacute;ma answered. 'Hatred dies<BR>
When low in dust the foeman lies.<BR>
Now triumph bids the conflict cease,<BR>
And knits us in the bonds of peace.<BR>
Let funeral rites be duly paid.<BR>
And be it mine thy toil to aid.'<BR>
