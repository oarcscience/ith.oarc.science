### CANTO C.: RAVAN IN THE FIELD.

The plain with bleeding limbs was spread,  
And heaps of dying and of dead.  
His mighty bow still Ráma strained,  
And shafts upon the giants rained.  
Still Angad and Sugríva, wrought  
To fury, for the Vánars fought.  
Crushed with huge rocks through chest and side  
Mahodar, Mahápárs'va died,  
And Vinúpáksha stained with gore  
Dropped on the plain to rise no more.  
When Rávan saw the three o'erthrown  
He cried aloud in furious tone:  
'Urge, urge the car, my charioteer.  
The haughty Vánars' death is near.  
This very day shall end our griefs  
For leaguered town and slaughtered chiefs.  
Ráma the tree whose lovely fruit  
Is Sítá, shall this arm uproot,--  
Whose branches with protecting shade  
Are Vánar lords who lend him aid.'  
Thus cried the king: the welkin rang  
As forth the eager coursers sprang,  
And earth beneath the chariot shook  
With flowery grove and hill and brook.  
Fast rained his shafts: where'er he sped  
The conquered Vánars fell or fled,  
On rolled the car in swift career  
Till Raghu's noble sons were near.  
Then Ráma looked upon the foe  
And strained and tried his sounding bow.  
Till earth and all the region rang  
Re-echoing to the awful clang.  
His bow the younger chieftain bent.  
And shaft on shaft at Rávan sent.  
He shot: but Rávan little recked;  
Each arrow with his own he checked,  
And headless, baffled of its aim,  
To earth the harmless missile came;  
And Lakshman stayed his arm o'erpowered  
By the thick darts the giant showered.  
Fierce waxed the fight and fiercer yet,  
For Rávan now and Ráma met,  
And each on other poured amain  
The tempest of his arrowy rain.  
While all the sky above was dark  
With missles speeding to their mark  
Like clouds, with flashing lightning twined  
About them, hurried by the wind.  
Not fiercer was the wondrous fight  
When Vritra fell by Indra's might.  
All arts off war each foeman knew,  
And trained alike, his bowstring drew.  
Red-eyed with fury Lanká's king  
Pressed his huge fingers on the string,  
And fixed in Ráma's brows a flight  
Of arrows winged with matchless flight.  

Still Raghu's son endured, and bore  
That crown of shafts though wounded sore.  
O'er a dire dart a spell he spoke  
With mystic power to aid the stroke.  
In vain upon the foe it smote  
Rebounding from the steelproof coat.  
The giant armed his bow anew,  
And wondrous weapons hissed and flew,  
Terrific, deadly, swift of flight,  
Beaked like the vulture and the kite,  
Or bearing heads of fearful make,  
Of lion, tiger, wolf and snake. <span

Then Ráma, troubled by the storm  
Of flying darts in every form  
Shot by an arm that naught could tire,  
Launched at the foe his dart of fire,  
Which, sacred to the Lord of Flame,  
Burnt and consumed where'er it came.  
And many a blazing shaft beside  
The hero to his string applied.  
With fiery course of dazzling hue  
Swift to the mark each missile flew,  
Some flashing like a shooting star,  
Some as the tongues of lightning are;  
One like a brilliant plant, one  
In splendour like the morning sun.  
Where'er the shafts of Ráma burned  
The giant's darts were foiled and turned.  
Far into space his weapons fled,  
But as they flew struck thousands dead.
