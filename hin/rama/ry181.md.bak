### CANTO CIII.: THE FUNERAL LIBATION.

When Rama heard from Bharat each  
Dark sorrow of his mournful speech,  
And tidings of his father dead,  
His spirits fell, his senses fled.  
For the sad words his brother spoke  
Struck on him like a thunder stroke.  
Fierce as the bolt which Indra throws,  
The victor of his Daitya foes.  
Raising his arms in anguish, he,  
As when the woodman hews a tree  
With its fair flowery branches crowned,  
Fainted and fell upon the ground.  
Lord of the earth to earth he sank.  
Helpless, as when a towering bank  
With sudden ruin buries deep  
An elephant who lay asleep.  
Then swift his wife and brothers flew,  
And water, weeping, o'er him threw.  
As slowly sense and strength he gained,  
Fast from his eyes the tears he rained,  
And then in accents sad and weak  
Kakutstha's son began to speak,  
And mourning for the monarch dead,  
With righteous words to Bharat said:  
'What calls me home, when he, alas,  
Has gone the way which all must pass?  
Of him, the best of kings bereft  
What guardian has Ayodhya left?  
How may I please his spirit? how  
Delight the high-souled monarch now,  
Who wept for me and went above  
By me ungraced with mourning love!  
Ah, happy brothers! you have paid  
Due offerings to his parting shade.  
E'en when my banishment is o'er,  
Back to my home I go no more,  
To look upon the widowed state  
Reft of her king, disconsolate.  
E'en then, O tamer of the foe,  
If to Ayodhya's town I go.  
Who will direct me as of old,  
Now other worlds our father hold?  
From whom, my brother, shall I hear  
Those words which ever charmed mine ear  
And filled my bosom with delight  
Whene'er he saw me act aright?'  
   Thus Rama spoke: then nearer came  
And looking on his moonbright dame,  
'Sit'a, the king is gone,' he said:  
   'And Lakshman, know thy sire is dead,  

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>  

And with the Gods on high enrolled:  
This mournful news has Bharat told.'  
He spoke: the noble youths with sighs  
Rained down the torrents from their eyes.  
And then the brothers of the chief  
With words of comfort soothed his grief:  
'Now to the king our sire who swayed  
The earth be due libations paid.'  
Soon as the monarch's fate she knew,  
Sharp pangs of grief smote Sita through:  
Nor could she look upon her lord  
With eyes from which the torrents poured.  
And Rama strove with tender care  
To soothe the weeping dame's despair,  
And then, with piercing woe distressed,  
The mournful Lakshman thus addressed:  
'Brother, I pray thee bring for me  
The pressed fruit of the Ingudi,  
And a bark mantle fresh and new,  
That I may pay this offering due.  
First of the three shall Sita go,  
Next thou, and I the last: for so  
Moves the funereal pomp of woe.' <span id="fr_379"></span>[1](#fn_379.md)  
   Sumantra of the noble mind,  
Gentle and modest, meek and kind,  
Who, follower of each princely youth,  
To Rama clung with constant truth,  
Now with the royal brothers' aid  
The grief of Rama soothed and stayed,  
And lent his arm his lord to guide  
Down to the river's holy side.  
Tnat lovely stream the heroes found,  
With woods that ever blossomed crowned,  
And there in bitter sorrow bent  
Their footsteps down the fair descent.  
Then where the stream that swiftly flowed  
A pure pellucid shallow showed,  
The funeral drops they duly shed,  
And 'Father, this be thine,' they said.  
But he, the lord who ruled the land,  
Filled from the stream his hollowed hand,  
And turning to the southern side  
Stretched out his arm and weeping cried:  
'This sacred water clear and pure,  
An offering which shall aye endure  
To thee, O lord of kings, I give:  
Accept it where the spirits live!'  
   Then, when the solemn rite was o'er,  
Came Rama to the river shore,  
And offered, with his brothers' aid,  
Fresh tribute to his father's shade.  

With jujube fruit he mixed the seed  
Of Ingudis from moisture freed,  
And placed it on a spot o'erspread  
With sacred grass, and weeping said:  
'Enjoy, great King, the cake which we  
Thy children eat and offer thee!  
For ne'er do blessed Gods refuse  
To share the food which mortals use.'  
   Then Rama turned him to retrace  
The path that brought him to the place,  
And up the mountain's pleasant side  
Where lovely lawns lay fair, he hied.  
Soon as his cottage door he gained.  
His brothers to his breast he strained.  
From them and Sit'a in their woes  
So loud the cry of weeping rose,  
That like the roar of lions round  
The mountain rolled the echoing sound.  
And Bharat's army shook with fear  
The weeping of the chiefs to hear.  
'Bharat,' the soldiers cried, ''tis plain,  
His brother Rama meets again,  
And with these cries that round us ring  
They sorrow for their sire the king.'  
Then leaving car and wain behind,  
One eager thought in every mind,  
Swift toward the weeping, every man,  
As each could find a passage, ran.  
Some thither bent their eager course  
With car, and elephant, and horse,  
And youthful captains on their feet  
With longing sped their lord to meet,  
As though the new-come prince had been  
An exile for long years unseen.  
Earth beaten in their frantic zeal  
By clattering hoof and rumbling wheel,  
Sent forth a deafening noise as loud  
As heaven when black with many a cloud,  
Then, with their consorts gathered near,  
Wild elephants in sudden fear  
Rushed to a distant wood, and shed  
An odour round them as they fled.  
And every silvan thing that dwelt  
Within those shades the terror felt,  
Deer, lion, tiger, boar and roe,  
Bison, wild-cow, and buffalo.  
And when the tumult wild they heard.  
With trembling pinions flew each bird,  
From tree, from thicket, and from lake,  
Swan, koil, curlew, crane, and drake.  
With men the ground was overspread,  
With startled birds the sky o'erhead.  
Then on his sacrificial ground  
The sinless, glorious chief was found.  
Loading with curses deep and loud  
The hump-back and the queen, the crowd.  
Whose checks were wet, whose eyes were dim,  
In fond affection ran to him.  
While the big tears their eyes bedewed,  
He looked upon the multitude,  

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>  

And then as sire and mother do,  
His arms about his loved ones threw.  
   Some to his feet with reverence pressed,  
     Some in his arms he strained:  
   Each friend, with kindly words addressed,  
     Due share of honour gained.  
   Then, by their mighty woe o'ercome,  
     The weeping heroes' cry  
   Filled, like the roar of many a drum,  
     Hill, cavern, earth, and sky.

procession on these occasions is that the children precede according to
age, then the women and after that the men according to age, the
