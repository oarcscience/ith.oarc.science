### CANTO LX.: KUMBHAKARN'A ROUSED.

With humbled heart and broken pride  
Through Lánka's gate the giant hied,  
Crushed, like an elephant beneath  
A lion's spring and murderous teeth,  
Or like a serpent neath the wing  
And talons of the Feathered King.  
Such was the giant's wild alarm  
At arrows shot by Ráma's arm;  
Shafts with red lightning round them curled,  
Like Brahmá's bolts that end the world.  
   Supported on his golden throne,  
With failing eye and humbled tone,  
'Giants,' he cried, 'the toil is vain,  
Fruitless the penance and the pain,  
If I whom Indra owned his peer,  
Secure from Gods, a mortal fear.  
My soul remembers, now too late,  
Lord Brahmá's words which spoke my fate:  
'Tremble, proud Giant,' thus they ran,  
'And dread thy death from slighted man.  
Secure from Gods and demons live,  
And serpents, by the boon I give.  
Against their power thy life is charmed,  
But against man is still unarmed,'  
This Ráma is the man foretold  
By Anaranra's  <span id="fr_982"></span>[1](#fn_982) lips of old:  
   'Fear, Rávan', basest of the base:  
For of mine own imperial race  
A prince in after time shall spring  
And thee and thine to ruin bring.  
And Vedavatí,  <span id="fr_983"></span>[2](#fn_983) ere she died  
Slain by my ruthless insult, cried:  

<span id="page_473">p. 473</span>  

'A scion of my royal line  
Shall slay, vile wretch, both thee and thine.'  
She in a later birth became  
King Janak's child, now Ráma's dame.  
Nandis'vara  <span id="fr_984"></span>[1](#fn_984) foretold this fate,  
And Umá  <span id="fr_985"></span>[2](#fn_985) when I moved her hate,  
And Rambhá,  <span id="fr_986"></span>[3](#fn_986) and the lovely
child  
Of Varun  <span id="fr_987"></span>[4](#fn_987) by thy touch defiled.  
I know the fated hour is nigh:  
Hence, captains, to your stations fly.  
Let warders on the rampart stand:  
Place at each gate a watchful band;  
And, terror of immortal eyes,  
Let mightiest Kumbhakarna rise.  
He, slumbering, free from care and pain,  
By Brahmá's curse, for months has lain.  
But when Prahasta's death he hears,  
Mine own defeat and doubts and fears,  
The chief will rise to smite the foe  
And his unrivalled valour show.  
Then Raghu's royal sons and all  
The Vánars neath his might will fall.'  
   The giant lords his hest obeyed,  
They left him, trembling and afraid,  
And from the royal palace strode  
To Kumbhakarna's vast abode.  
They carried garlands sweet and fresh,  
And reeking loads of blood and flesh.  
They reached the dwelling where he lay,  
A cave that stretched a league each way,  
Sweet with fair blooms of lovely scent  
And bright with golden ornament.  
His breathings came so fierce and fast.  
Scarce could the giants brook the blast.  
They found him on a golden bed  
With his huge limbs at length outspread.  

They piled their heaps of venison near,  
Fat buffaloes and boars and deer.  
With wreaths of flowers they fanned his face,  
And incense sweetened all the place.  
Each raised his mighty voice as loud  
As thunders of an angry cloud,  
And conchs their stirring summons gave  
That echoed through the giant's cave.  
Then on his breast they rained their blows.  
And high the wild commotion rose  
When cymbal vied with drum and horn.  
And war cries on the gale upborne  
Through all the air loud discord spread,  
And, struck with fear, the birds fell dead.  
But still he slept and took his rest.  
Then dashed they on his shaggy chest  
Clubs, maces, fragments of the rock:  
He moved not once, nor felt the shock.  
The giants made one effort more  
With shell and drum and shout and roar.  
Club, mallet, mace, in fury plied,  
Rained blows upon his breast and side,  
And elephants were urged to aid,  
And camels groaned and horses neighed.  
They drenched him with a hundred pails,  
They tore his ears with teeth and nails.  
They bound together many a mace  
And beat him on the head and face;  
And elephants with ponderous tread  
Stamped on his limbs and chest and head.  
The unusual weight his slumber broke:  
He started, shook his sides, and woke;  
And, heedless of the wounds and blows,  
Yawning with thirst and hunger rose.  
His jaws like hell gaped fierce and wide,  
Dire as the flame neath ocean's tide.  
Red as the sun on Meru's crest  
The giant's face his wrath expressed,  
And every burning breath he drew  
Was like the blast that rushes through  
The mountain cedars. Up he raised  
His awful head with eyes that blazed  
Like comets, dire as Death in form  
Who threats the worlds with fire and storm.  
The giants pointed to their stores  
Of buffaloes and deer and boars,  
And straight he gorged him with a flood  
Of wine, with marrow, flesh, and blood.  
He ceased: the giants ventured near  
And bent their lowly heads in fear.  
Then Kumbhakarna glared with eyes  
Still heavy in their first surprise,  
Still drowsy from his troubled rest,  
And thus the giant band addressed.  
'How have ye dared my sleep to break?  
No trifling cause should bid me wake.  
Say, is all well? or tell the need  
That drives you with unruly speed  
To wake me. Mark the words I say,  
The king shall tremble in dismay,  

<span id="page_474">p. 474</span>  

The fire be quenched and Indra slain  
Ere ye shall break my rest in vain.'  
   Yupáksha answered: 'Chieftain, hear;  
No God or fiend excites our fear.  
But men in arms our walls assail:  
We tremble lest their might prevail.  
For vengeful Ráma vows to slay  
The foe who stole his queen away,  
And, matchless for his warlike deeds,  
A host of mighty Vánars leads.  
Ere now a monstrous Vánar came.  
Laid Lanká waste with ruthless flame,  
And Aksha, Rávan's offspring, blew  
With all his warrior retinue.  
Our king who never trembled yet  
For heavenly hosts in battle met.  
At length the general dread has shared,  
O'erthrown by Ráma's arm and spared.'  
   He ceased: and Kumbhakarna spake:  
'I will go forth and vengeance take;  
Will tread their hosts beneath my feet,  
Then triumph-flushed our king will meet.  
Our giant bands shall eat their fill  
Of Vánars whom this arm shall kill.  
The princes' blood shall be my draught,  
The chieftains' shall by you be quaffed.'  
He spake, and, with an eager stride  
That shook the earth, to Rávan hied,
