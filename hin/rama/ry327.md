### CANTO LIII.: ANGAD'S COUNSEL.

They looked upon the boundless main  
The awful seat of Varun's reign.  
And heard his waters roar and rave  
Terrific with each crested wave.  
Then, in the depths of sorrow drowned,  
They sat upon the bosky ground,  
And sadly, as they pondered, grieved  
For days gone by and naught achieved.  
Pain pierced them through with sharper sting  
When, gazing on the trees of spring,  
They saw each waving bough that showed  
The treasures of its glorious load,  
And helpless, fainting with the weight  
Of woe they sank disconsolate.  
Then, lion-shouldered, stout and strong,  
The noblest of the Vánar throng,  
Angad the prince imperial rose,  
And, deeply stricken by the woes  
That his impetuous spirit broke,  
Thus gently to the chieftains spoke:  
'Mark ye not, Vánars, that the day  
Our monarch fixed has passed away?  
The month is lost in toil and pain,  
And now, my friends, what hopes remain?  
On you, in lore of counsel tried,  
Our king Sugríva most relied.  
Your hearts, with strong affection fraught,  

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>  

His weal in every labour sought,  
And the true valour of your band  
Was blazoned wide in every land.  
Forth on the toilsome search you sped,  
By me--for so he willed it--led.  
To us, of every hope bereft,  
Death is the only refuge left.  
For none a happy life may see  
Who fails to do our king's decree.  
Come, let us all from food abstain,  
And perish thus, since hope is vain.  
Stern is our king and swift to ire,  
Imperious, proud, and fierce like fire,  
And ne'er will pardon us the crime  
Of fruitless search and wasted time.  
Far better thus to end our lives,  
And leave our wealth, our homes and wives,  
Leave our dear little ones and all,  
Than by his vengeful hand to fall.  
Think not Sugríva's wrath will spare  
Me Báli's son, imperial heir:  
For Raghu's royal son, not he,  
To this high place anointed me,  
Sugríva, long my bitter foe,  
With eager hand will strike the blow,  
And, mindful of the old offence,  
Will slay me now for negligence,  
Nor will my pitying friends have power  
To save me in the deadly hour.  
No--here, O chieftains, will I lie  
By ocean's marge, and fast and die.'  
   They heard the royal prince declare  
The purpose of his fixt despair;  
And all, by common terror moved,  
His speech in these sad words approved:  
'Sugríva's heart is hard and stern,  
And Ráma's thoughts for Sítá yearn.  
Our forfeit lives will surely pay  
For idle search and long delay,  
And our fierce king will bid us die  
The favour of his friend to buy.'  
   Then Tára softly spake to cheer  
The Vánars' hearts oppressed by fear:  
'Despair no more, your doubts dispel:  
Come in this ample cavern dwell.  
There may we live in blissful ease  
Mid springs and fruit and bloomy trees,  
Secure from every foe's assault,  
For magic framed the wondrous vault.  
Protected there we need not fear  
Though Ráma and our king come near;  
Nor dread e'en him who batters down  
The portals of the foeman's town.'  <span

destroyer of cities; the cities being the clouds which the God of the
firmament bursts open with his thunderbolts, to release the waters
imprisoned in these fortesses of the demons of drought.
