### CANTO LIII.: THE PUNISHMENT.

King Rávan, by his pleading moved,  
The counsel of the chief approved:  
   'Thy words are wise and true; to kill  
An envoy would beseem us ill  
Yet must we for his crime invent  
Some fitting mode of punishment.  
The tail, I fancy, is the part  
Most cherished by a monkey's heart. <span
id="fr_893"></span>[1](#fn_893)  
Make ready: set his tail aflame,  
And let him leave us as he came,  
And thus disfigured and disgraced  
Back to his king and people haste.'  
   The giants heard their monarch's speech;  
And, filled with burning fury, each  
Brought strips of cotton cloth, and round  
The monkey's tail the bandage wound.  
As round big tail the bands they drew  
His mighty form dilating grew  

Vast as the flame that bursts on high  
Where trees are old and grass is dry.  
Each hand and strip they soaked in oil,  
And set on fire the twisted coil.  
Delighted as they viewed the blaze,  
The cruel demons stood at gaze:  
And mid loud drums and shells rang out  
The triumph of their joyful shout.  
They pressed about him thick and fast  
As through the crowded streets he passed,  
Observing with attentive care  
Each rich and wondrous structure there,  
Still heedless of the eager cry  
That rent the air, The spy! the spy!  
   Some to the captive lady ran.  
And thus in joyous words began:  
'That copper-visaged monkey, he  
Who in the garden talked with thee,  
Through Lanká's town is led a show,  
And round his tail the red flames glow.'  
The mournful news the lady heard  
That with fresh grief her bosom stirred.  
Swift to the kindled fire she went  
And prayed before it reverent:  
'If I my husband have obeyed,  
And kept the ascetic vows I made,  
Free, ever free, from stain and blot,  
O spare the Vánar; harm him not.'  
   Then leapt on high the flickering flame  
And shone in answer to the dame.  
The pitying fire its rage forbore:  
The Vánar felt the heat no more.  
Then, to minutest size reduced, <span id="fr_894"></span>[1b](#fn_894)  
The bonds that bound his limbs he loosed,  
And, freed from every band and chain,  
Rose to his native size again.  
He seized a club of ponderous weight  
That lay before him by the gate,  
Rushed at the fiends that hemmed him round,  
And laid them lifeless on the ground,  
Through Lanká's town again he strode,  
And viewed each street and square and road,--  
Still wreathed about with harmless blaze,  
A sun engarlanded with rays.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_893"></span>[423:1](ry391.htm#fr_893) I have not attempted
to tone down anything in this Canto. I give a faithful translation.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[423:1b](ry391.htm#fr_894) "Behold a wonder!
they but now who seemed In bigness to surpass earth's giant sons, Now
less than smallest dwarfs in narrow room Throng numberless."

*Paradise Lost*, I, 716.
