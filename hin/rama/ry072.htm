<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXII.: THE GIFT OF KINE.</H3>
<P>
When royal Janak's words were done,<BR>
Joined with Vas'ishtha Kus'ik's son,<BR>
The mighty sage began his speech:<BR>
'No mind may soar, no thought can reach<BR>
The glories of Ikshv&aacute;ku's line,<BR>
Or, great Videha's King, of thine:<BR>
None in the whole wide world may vie<BR>
With them in fame and honours high.<BR>
Well matched, I ween, in holy bands,<BR>
These peerless pairs will join their hands.<BR>
But hear me as I speak once more;<BR>
Thy brother, skilled in duty's lore,<BR>
Has at his home a royal pair<BR>
Of daughters most divinely fair.<BR>
I for the hands of these sweet two<BR>
For Bharat and S'atrughna sue,<BR>
Both princes of heroic mould,<BR>
Wise, fair of form, and lofty-souled.<BR>
All Das'aratha's sons, I ween,<BR>
Own each young grace of form and mien:<BR>
Brave as the Gods are they, nor yield<BR>
To the great Lords the worlds who shield.<BR>


<P>

<P>


<P>
By these, good Prince of merits high,<BR>
Ikshv&aacute;ku's house with thine ally.'<BR>

<P>
The suit the holy sage preferred,<BR>
With willing ear the monarch heard:<BR>
Vas'ishtha's lips the counsel praised:<BR>
Then spake the king with hands upraised:<BR>
'Now blest indeed my race I deem,<BR>
Which your high will, O Saints supreme,<BR>
With Das'aratha's house unites<BR>
In bonds of love and marriage rites.<BR>
So be it done. My nieces twain<BR>
Let Bharat and S'atrughna gain,<BR>
And the four youths the selfsame day<BR>
Four maiden hands in theirs shall lay.<BR>
No day so lucky may compare,<BR>
For marriage--so the wise declare--<BR>
With the last day of Ph&aacute;lguni<BR>
Ruled by the genial deity.'<BR>
Then with raised hands in reverence due<BR>
To those arch-saints he spoke anew:<BR>
'I am your pupil, ever true:<BR>
To me high favour have ye shown;<BR>
Come, sit ye on my royal throne,<BR>
For Das'aratha rules these towers<BR>
E'en as Ayodhy&aacute; now is ours.<BR>
Do with your own whate'er ye choose:<BR>
Your lordship here will none refuse.'<BR>

<P>
He spoke, and to Videha's king<BR>
Thus Das'aratha, answering:<BR>
'Boundless your virtues, lords, wbose sway<BR>
The realms of Mithil&aacute; obey.<BR>
With honouring care you entertain.<BR>
Both holy sage and royal train.<BR>
Now to my house my steps I bend--<BR>
May blessings still on you at end--<BR>
Due offerings to the shades to pay.'<BR>
Thus spoke the king, and turned away:<BR>
To Janak first he bade adieu,<BR>
Then followed fast those holy two.<BR>
The monarch reached his palace where<BR>
The rites were paid with solemn care.<BR>
When the next sun began to shine<BR>
He rose and made his gift of kine.<BR>
A bundled thousand cows prepared<BR>
For each young prince the Br&aacute;hmans shared.<BR>
Each had her horns adorned with gold;<BR>
And duly was the number told,<BR>
Four hundred thousand perfect tale:<BR>
Each brought a calf, each filled a pail.<BR>
And when that glorious task was o'er,<BR>
The monarch with his children four,<BR>
Showed like the Lord of Life divine<BR>
When the worlds' guardians round him shine.<BR>
