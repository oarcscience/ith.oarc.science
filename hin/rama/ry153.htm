<P>
A while he lay: he rose at length,<BR>
And slowly gathering sense and strength,<BR>
With angry eyes which tears bedewed,<BR>
The miserable queen he viewed,<BR>
And spake with keen reproach to her<BR>
Before each lord and minister:<BR>
'No lust have I for kingly sway,<BR>
My mother I no more obey:<BR>
Naught of this consecration knew<BR>
Which Das'aratha kept in view,<BR>
I with S'atrughna all the time<BR>
Was dwelling in a distant clime:<BR>
I knew of R&aacute;ma's exile naught,<BR>
That hero of the noble thought:<BR>
I knew not how fair S&iacute;t&aacute; went,<BR>
And Lakshman, forth to banishment.'<BR>

<P>
Thus high-souled Bharat, mid the crowd,<BR>
Lifted his voice and cried aloud.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_184"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 184</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Kaus'aly&aacute; heard, she raised ner head.<BR>
And quickly to Sumitr&aacute; said:<BR>
'Bharat, Kaikey&iacute;'s son, is here,--<BR>
Hers whose fell deeds I loathe and fear:<BR>
That youth of foresight keen I fain<BR>
Would meet and see his face again.'<BR>
Thus to Sumitr&aacute; spake the dame,<BR>
And straight to Bharat's presence came<BR>
With altered mien, neglected dress,<BR>
Trembling and faint with sore distress.<BR>
Bharat, S'atrughna by his side,<BR>
To meet her, toward her palace hied.<BR>
And when the royal dame they viewed<BR>
Distressed with dire solicitude,<BR>
Sad, fallen senseless on the ground,<BR>
About her neck their arms they wound.<BR>
The noble matron prostrate there,<BR>
Embraced, with tears, the weeping pair,<BR>
And with her load of grief oppressed,<BR>
To Bharat then these words addressed:<BR>
'Now all is thine, without a foe,<BR>
This realm for which thou longest so.<BR>
Ah, soon Kaikey&iacute;'s ruthless hand<BR>
Has won the empire of the land,<BR>
And made my guiltless R&aacute;ma flee<BR>
Dressed like some lonely devotee.<BR>
Herein what profit has the queen,<BR>
Whose eye delights in havoc, seen?<BR>
Me also, me 'twere surely good<BR>
To banish to the distant wood,<BR>
To dwell amid the shades that hold<BR>
My famous son with limbs like gold.<BR>
Nay, with the sacred fire to guide,<BR>
Will I, Sumitr&aacute; by my side,<BR>
Myself to the drear wood repair<BR>
And seek the son of Raghu there.<BR>
This land which rice and golden corn<BR>
And wealth of every kind adorn,<BR>
Car, elephant, and steed, and gem,--<BR>
She makes thee lord of it and them.'<BR>

<P>
With taunts like these her bitter tongue<BR>
The heart of blameless Bharat wrung<BR>
And direr pangs his bosom tore<BR>
Than when the lancet probes a sore.<BR>
With troubled senses all astray<BR>
Prone at her feet he fell and lay.<BR>
With loud lament a while he plained,<BR>
And slowly strength and sense regained.<BR>
With suppliant hand to hand applied<BR>
He turned to her who wept and sighed,<BR>
And thus bespake the queen, whose breast<BR>
With sundry woes was sore distressed:<BR>
'Why these reproaches, noble dame?<BR>
I, knowing naught, am free from blame.<BR>
Thou knowest well what love was mine<BR>
For R&aacute;ma, chief of Raghu's line.<BR>
O, never be his darkened mind<BR>
To Scripture's guiding lore inclined,<BR>
By whose consent the prince who led<BR>
The good, the truthful hero, fled.<BR>
May he obey the vilest lord,<BR>
Offend the sun with act abhorred, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_350"></A><A HREF="#fn_350"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
And strike a sleeping cow, who lent<BR>
His voice to R&aacute;ma's banishment.<BR>
May the good king who all befriends,<BR>
And, like his sons, the people tends,<BR>
Be wronged by him who gave consent<BR>
To noble R&aacute;ma's banishment.<BR>
On him that king's injustice fall,<BR>
Who takes, as lord, a sixth of all,<BR>
Nor guards, neglectful of his trust,<BR>
His people, as a ruler must.<BR>
The crime of those who swear to fee,<BR>
At holy rites, some devotee,<BR>
And then the promised gift deny,<BR>
Be his who willed the prince should fly,<BR>
When weapons clash and heroes bleed,<BR>
With elephant and harnessed steed,<BR>
Ne'er, like the good, be his to fight<BR>
Whose heart allowed the prince's flight.<BR>
Though taught with care by one expert<BR>
May he the Veda's text pervert,<BR>
With impious mind on evil bent,<BR>
Whose voice approved the banishment.<BR>
Mav he with traitor lips reveal<BR>
Whate'er he promised to conceal,<BR>
And bruit abroad his friend's offence,<BR>
Betrayed by generous confidence.<BR>
No wife of equal lineage born<BR>
The wretch's joyless home adorn:<BR>
Ne'er may he do one virtuous deed,<BR>
And dying see no child succeed.<BR>
When in the battle's awful day<BR>
Fierce warriors stand in dread array,<BR>
Let the base coward turn and fly,<BR>
And smitten by the foeman, die.<BR>
Long may he wander, rags his wear,<BR>
Doomed in his hand a skull to bear,<BR>
And like an idiot beg his bread,<BR>
Who gave consent when Rama fled.<BR>
His sin who holy rites forgets,<BR>
Asleep when shows the sun and sets,<BR>
A load upon his soul shall lie<BR>
Whose will allowed the prince to fly.<BR>
His sin who loves his Master's dame,<BR>
His, kindler of destructive flame.<BR>
His who betrays his trusting friend<BR>
Shall, mingled all, on him descend.<BR>
By him no reverence due be paid<BR>
To blessed God or parted shade:<BR>
May sire and mother's sacred name<BR>
In vain from him obedience claim.<BR>
Ne'er may he go where dwell the good,<BR>
Nor win their fame and neighbourhood,<BR>
But lose all hopes of bliss to day,<BR>
Who willed the prince should flee away.<BR>
May he deceive the poor and weak<BR>
Who look to him and comfort seek,<BR>

<P>
Betray the suppliants who complain,<BR>
And make the hopeful hope in vain.<BR>
Long may his wife his kiss expect,<BR>
And pine away in cold neglect.<BR>
May he his lawful love despise,<BR>
And turn on other dames his eyes,<BR>
Fool, on forbidden joys intent,<BR>
Whose will allowed the banishment.<BR>
His sin who deadly poison throws<BR>
To spoil the water as it flows,<BR>
Lay on the wretch its burden dread<BR>
Who gave consent when Rama fled.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_351"></A><A HREF="ry154.htm#fn_351"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Thus with his words he undeceived<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;'s troubled heart, who grieved<BR>
For son and husband reft away;<BR>
Then prostrate on the ground he lay.<BR>
Him as he lay half-senseless there,<BR>
Freed by the mighty oaths he sware,<BR>
Kaus'aly&aacute;, by her woe distressed,<BR>
With melancholy words addressed:<BR>
'Anew, my son, this sorrow springs<BR>
To rend my heart with keener stings:<BR>
These awful oaths which thou hast sworn<BR>
My breast with double grief have torn.<BR>
Thy soul, and faithful Lakshman's too,<BR>
Are still, thank Heaven! to virtue true.<BR>
True to thy promise, thou shalt gain<BR>
The mansions which the good obtain.'<BR>

<P>
Then to her breast that youth she drew,<BR>
Whose sweet fraternal love she knew,<BR>
And there in strict embraces held<BR>
The hero, as her tears outwelled.<BR>
And Bharat's heart grew sick and faint<BR>
With grief and oft-renewed complaint,<BR>
And all his senses were distraught<BR>
By the great woe that in him wrought.<BR>
Thus he lay and still bewailed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With sighs and loud lament<BR>
Till all his strength and reason failed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The hours of night were spent.<BR>
