### CANTO XL.: RÁVAN ATTACKED.

Still stood the son of Raghu where  
Suvela's peak rose high in air,  
And with Sugríva turned his eye  
To scan each quarter of the sky.  
There on Trikúta, nobly planned  
And built by Vis'vakarmá's hand,  
He saw the lovely Lanká, dressed  
In all her varied beauty, rest.  
High on a tower above the gate  
The tyrant stood in kingly state,  
The royal canopy displayed  
Above him lent its grateful shade,  
And servants, from the giant band,  
His cheek with jewelled chowries fanned.  
Red sandal o'er his breast was spread,  
His ornaments and robe were red:  
Thus shows a cloud of darksome hue  
With golden sunbeams flashing through.  
While Ráma and the chiefs intent  
Upon the king their glances bent,  
Up sprang Sugríva from the ground  
And reached the turret at a bound.  
Unterrified the Vánar stood,  
And wroth, with wondrous hardihood,  
The king in bitter words addressed,  
And thus his scorn and hate expressed:  

'King of the giant race, in me  
The friend and slave of Ráma see.  
Lord of the world, he gives me power  
To smite thee in thy fenced tower.'  
While through the air his challenge rang,  
At Rávan's face the Vánar sprang.  
Snatched from his head the kingly crown  
And dashed it in his fury down.  
Straight at his foe the giant flew,  
His mighty arms about him threw.  
With strength resistless swung him round  
And dashed him panting to the ground,  

Unharmed amid the storm of blows  
Swift to his feet Sugríva rose.  
Again in furious fight they met:  
With streams of blood their limbs were wet,  
Each grasping his opponent's waist.  
Thus with their branches interlaced,  
Which, crimson with the flowers of spring,  
From side to side the breezes swing,  
In furious wrestle you may see  
The Kins'uk and the Seemal tree.  <span
id="fr_958"></span>[1](ry440.htm#fn_958.md)  
They fought with fists and hands, alike  
Prepared to parry and to strike.  
Long time the doubtful combat, waged  
With matchless strength and fury, raged.  
Each fiercely struck, each guarded well,  
Till, closing, from the tower they fell,  
And, grasping each the other's throat,  
Lay for an instant in the moat,  
Then rose, and each in fiercer mood  
The sanguinary strife renewed.  
Well matched in size and strength and skill  
They fought the dubious battle still.  
While sweat and blood their limbs bedewed  
They met, retreated, and pursued:  
Each stratagem and art they tried,  
Stood front to front and swerved aside.  
His hand a while the giant stayed  
And called his magic to his aid.  
But brave Sugríva, swift to know  
The guileful purpose of the foe,  
Gained with light leap the upper air.  
And breath and strength and spirit then;  
Then, joyous as for victory won,  
Returned to Raghu's royal son.
