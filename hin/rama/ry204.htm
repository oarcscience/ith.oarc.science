<P>
When he his heavenly home had found,<BR>
The holy men who dwelt around<BR>
To R&aacute;ma flocked, whose martial fame<BR>
Shone glorious as the kindled flame:<BR>
Vaikh&aacute;nasas &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_415"></A><A HREF="#fn_415"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> who love the wild.<BR>
Pure hermits B&aacute;lakhilyas &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_416"></A><A HREF="#fn_416"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> styled,<BR>
Good Sampraksh&aacute;las, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_417"></A><A HREF="#fn_417"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> saints who live<BR>
On rays which moon and daystar give:<BR>
Those who with leaves their lives sustain<BR>
And those who pound with stones their grain:<BR>
And they who lie in pools, and those<BR>
Whose corn, save teeth, no winnow knows:<BR>
Those who for beds the cold earth use,<BR>
And those who every couch refuse:<BR>
And those condemned to ceaseless pains,<BR>
Whose single foot their weight sustains:<BR>
And those who sleep neath open skies,<BR>
Whose food the wave or air supplies,<BR>
And hermits pure who spend their nights<BR>
On ground prepared for sacred rites;<BR>
Those who on hills their vigil hold,<BR>
Or dripping clothes around them fold:<BR>
The devotees who live for prayer,<BR>
Or the five fires &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_418"></A><A HREF="#fn_418"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> unflinching bear.<BR>
On contemplation all intent,<BR>
With light that heavenly knowledge lent,<BR>
They came to R&aacute;ma, saint and sage,<BR>
In S'arabhaga's hermitage.<BR>
The hermit crowd around him pressed,<BR>
And thus the virtuous chief addressed:<BR>
'The lordship of the earth is thine,<BR>
O Prince of old Ikshv&aacute;ku's line.<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Lord of the Gods is Indra, so<BR>
Thou art our lord and guide below.<BR>
Thy name, the glory of thy might,<BR>
Throughout the triple world are bright:<BR>
Thy filial love so nobly shown.<BR>
Thy truth and virtue well are known.<BR>
To thee, O lord, for help we fly,<BR>
And on thy love of right rely:<BR>
With kindly patience hear us speak,<BR>
And grant the boon we humbly seek.<BR>
That lord of earth were most unjust,<BR>
Foul traitor to his solemn trust,<BR>
Who should a sixth of all &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_419"></A><A HREF="#fn_419"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A> require,<BR>
Nor guard his people like a sire.<BR>
But he who ever watchful strives<BR>
To guard his subjects' wealth and lives,<BR>
Dear as himself or, dearer still,<BR>
His sons, with earnest heart and will,--<BR>
That king, O Raghu's son, secures<BR>
High fame that endless years endures,<BR>
And he to Brahm&aacute;'s world shall rise,<BR>
Made glorious in the eternal skies,<BR>
Whate'er, by duty won, the meed<BR>
Of saints whom roots and berries feed,<BR>
One fourth thereof, for tender care<BR>
Of subjects, is the monarch's share.<BR>
These, mostly of the Br&aacute;hman race,<BR>
Who make the wood their dwelling-place,<BR>
Although a friend in thee they view,<BR>
Fall friendless neath the giant crew.<BR>
Come, R&aacute;ma, come, and see hard by<BR>
The holy hermits' corpses lie,<BR>
Where many a tangled pathway shows<BR>
The murderous work of cruel foes.<BR>
These wicked fiends the hermits kill--<BR>
Who live on Chitrak&uacute;ta's hill,<BR>
And blood of slaughtered saints has dyed<BR>
Mand&aacute;kin&iacute; and Pamp&aacute;'s side.<BR>
No longer can we bear to see<BR>
The death of saint and devotee<BR>
Whom through the forest day by day<BR>
These R&aacute;kshases unpitying slay.<BR>
To thee, O Prince, we flee, and crave<BR>
Thy guardian help our lives to save.<BR>
From these fierce rovers of the night<BR>
Defend each stricken anchorite.<BR>
Throughout the world 'twere vain to seek<BR>
An arm like thine to aid the weak.<BR>
O Prince, we pray thee hear our call,<BR>
And from these fiends preserve us all.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The son of Raghu heard the plaint<BR>
Of penance-loving sage and saint,<BR>
And the good prince his speech renewed<BR>
To all the hermit multitude:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'To me, O saints, ye need not sue:<BR>
I wait the hests of all of you.<BR>
I by mine own occasion led<BR>
This mighty forest needs must tread,<BR>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="page_236"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 236</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And while I keep my sire's decree<BR>
Your lives from threatening foes will free.<BR>
I hither came of free accord<BR>
To lend the aid by you implored,<BR>
And richest meed my toil shall pay,<BR>
While here in forest shades I stay.<BR>
I long in battle strife to close.<BR>
And slay these fiends, the hermits' foes,<BR>
That saint and sage may learn aright<BR>
My prowess and my brother's might.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus to'the saints his promise gave<BR>
That prince who still to virtue clave<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  With never-wandering thought:<BR>
And then with Lakshman by his side,<BR>
With penance-wealthy men to guide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sut&iacute;kshna's home he sought.<BR>
