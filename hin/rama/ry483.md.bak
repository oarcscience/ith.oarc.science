### CANTO CXII.: THE RÁKSHAS DAMES.

High rose the universal wail  
That mourned the monarch's death, and, pale  
With crushing woe, her hair unbound,  
Her eyes in floods of sorrow drowned,  
Forth from the inner chambers came  
With trembling feet each royal dame,  
Heedless of those who bade them stay  
They reached the field where Rávan lay;  

There falling by their husband's side,  
'Ah, King! ah dearest lord!' they cried.  
Like creepers shattered by the storm  
They threw them on his mangled form.  
One to his bleeding bosom crept  
And lifted up her voice and wept.  
About his feet one mourner clung.  
Around his neck another hung.  
One on the giant's severed head.  
Her pearly tears in torrents shed  
Fast as the drops the summer shower  
Pours down upon the lotus flower.  
'Ah, he whose arm in anger reared  
The King of Gods and Yama feared.  
While panic struck their heavenly train,  
Lies prostrate in the battle slain.  
Thy haughty heart thou wouldst not bend,  
Nor listen to each wiser friend.  
Ah, had the dame, as they implored,  
Been yielded to her injured lord,  
We had not mourned this day thy fall,  
And happy had it been for all.  
Then Ráma and thy friends content  
In blissful peace their days had spent.  
Thine injured brother had not fled.  
Nor giant chiefs and Vánars bled.  
Yet for these woes we will not blame.  
Thy fancy for the Maithil dame,  
Fate, ruthless Fate, vhom none may bend  
Has urged thee to thy hapless end.'
