<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXIII.: LAKSHMAN'S ANGER.</H3>
<P>
Thus Rama to his brother said;<BR>
And Laksbnmn bent his drooping head.<BR>
In turns by grief and pride impelled,<BR>
A middle course of thought he held,<BR>
Then in a frown of anger, bent<BR>
His brows that chief most excellent,<BR>
And like a serpent in his hole,<BR>
Breathed fierce and fast in wrath of soul.<BR>
His threatening brows so darkly frowned,<BR>
His eyes so fiercely glanced around,<BR>
They made his glare, which none might brook,<BR>
Like some infuriate lion's look.<BR>
Like some wild elephant, full oft<BR>
He raised and shook his hand &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_291"></A><A HREF="#fn_291"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> aloft.<BR>
Now turned his neck to left and right<BR>
Now bent, now raised its stately height.<BR>
Now in his rage that sword he felt<BR>
Which mangling wounds to foemen dealt,<BR>
With sidelong glance his brother eyed,<BR>
And thus in burning words replied:<BR>
'Thy rash resolve, thy eager haste,<BR>
Thy mighty fear, are all misplaced:<BR>
No room is here for duty's claim,<BR>
No cause to dread the people's blame.<BR>
Can one as brave as thou consent<BR>
To use a coward's argument?<BR>
The glory of the Warrior race<BR>
With craven speech his lips debase?<BR>
Can one like thee so falsely speak,<BR>
Exalling Fate, confessed so weak?<BR>
Canst thou, undoubting still restrain?<BR>
Suspicions of those sinful twain?<BR>

<P>

<P>
Canst thou, most duteous, fail to know<BR>
Their hearts are set on duty's show?<BR>
They with deceit have set their trains,<BR>
And now the fruit rewards their pains,<BR>
Had they not long ago agreed,<BR>
O Rama, on this treacherous deed,<BR>
That promised boon, so long retained,<BR>
He erst had given and she had gained.<BR>
I cannot, O my brother, bear<BR>
To see another throned as heir<BR>
With rites which all our people hate:<BR>
Then, O, this passion tolerate.<BR>
This vaunted duty which can guide<BR>
Thy steps from wisdom's path aside,<BR>
And change the counsel of thy breast,<BR>
O lofty-hearted, I detest.<BR>
Wilt thou, when power and might are thine,<BR>
Submit to this abhorred design?<BR>
Thy father's impious hest fulfil,<BR>
That vassal of Kaikeyi's will?<BR>
But if thou still wilt shut thine eyes,<BR>
Nor see the guile herein that lies.<BR>
My soul is sad, I deeply mourn.<BR>
And duty seems a thing to scorn.<BR>
Canst thou one moment think to please<BR>
This pair who live for love and ease,<BR>
And 'gainst thy peace, as foes, allied,<BR>
With tenderest names their hatred hide<BR>
Now if thy judgment still refers<BR>
To Fate this plot of his and hers,<BR>
My mind herein can ne'er agree:<BR>
And O, in this be ruled by me.<BR>
Weak, void of manly pride are they<BR>
Who bend to Fate's imputed sway:<BR>
The choicest souls, the nobly great<BR>
Disdain to bow their heads to Fate.<BR>
And he who dares his Fate control<BR>
With vigorous act and manly soul,<BR>
Though threatening Fate his hopes assail.<BR>
Unmoved through all need never quail.<BR>
This day mankind shall learn aright<BR>
The power of Fate and human might,<BR>
So shall the gulf that lies between<BR>
A man and Fate be clearly seen.<BR>
The might of Fate subdued by me<BR>
This hour the citizens shall see,<BR>
Who saw its intervention stay<BR>
Thy consecrating rites to-day<BR>
My power shall turn this Fate aside,<BR>
That threatens, as, with furious stride,<BR>
An elephant who scorns to feel,<BR>
In rage unchecked, tne driver's steel.<BR>
Not the great Lords whose sleepless might<BR>
Protects the worlds, shall stay the rite<BR>
Though earth, hell, heaven combine their powers:<BR>
And shall we fear this sire of ours?<BR>
Then if their minds are idly bent<BR>
To doom thee, King, to banishment,<BR>
Through twice seven years of exile they<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
Shall In the lonely forest stay.<BR>
I will consume the hopes that fire<BR>
The queen Kaikey&iacute; and our sire,<BR>
That to her son this check will bring<BR>
Advantage, making Bharat king.<BR>
The power of Fate will ne'er withstand<BR>
The might that arms my vigorous hand;<BR>
If danger and distress assail,<BR>
My fearless strength will still prevail.<BR>
A thousand circling years shall flee:<BR>
The forest then thy home shall be,<BR>
And thy good sons, succeeding, hold<BR>
The empire which their sire controlled.<BR>
The royal saints, of old who reigned,<BR>
For aged kings this rest ordained:<BR>
These to their sons their realm commit<BR>
That they, like sires, may cherish it.<BR>
O pious soul, if thou decline<BR>
The empire which is justly thine,<BR>
Lest, while the king distracted lies,<BR>
Disorder in the state should rise,<BR>
I,--or no mansion may I find<BR>
In worlds to hero souls assigned,--<BR>
The guardian of thy realm will be,<BR>
As the sea-bank protects the sea.<BR>
Then cast thine idle fears aside:<BR>
With prosperous rites be sanctified.<BR>
The lords of earth may strive in vain:<BR>
My power shall all their force restrain.<BR>
My pair of arms, my warrior's bow<BR>
Are not for pride of empty show:<BR>
For no support these shafts were made;<BR>
And binding up ill suits my blade:<BR>
To pierce the foe with deadly breach--<BR>
This is the work of all and each.<BR>
But small, methinks the love I show<BR>
For him I count my mortal foe.<BR>
Soon as my trenchant steel is bare,<BR>
Flashing its lightning through the air,<BR>
I heed no foe, nor stand aghast<BR>
Though Indra's self the levin cast.<BR>
Then shall the ways be hard to pass,<BR>
Where chariots lie in ruinous mass;<BR>
When elephant and man and steed<BR>
Crushed in the murderous onslaught bleed,<BR>
And legs and heads tall, heap on heap,<BR>
Beneath my sword's tremendous sweep.<BR>
Struck by my keen brand's trenchant blade,<BR>
Thine enemies shall fall dismayed,<BR>
Like towering mountains rent in twain,<BR>
Or lightning clouds that burst in rain.<BR>
When armed with brace and glove I stand,<BR>
And take my trusty bow in hand,<BR>
Who then shall vaunt his might? who dare<BR>
Count him a man to meet me there?<BR>
Then will I loose my shafts, and strike<BR>
Man, elephant, and steed alike:<BR>
At one shall many an arrow fly,<BR>
And many a foe with one shall die.<BR>
This day the world my power shall see,<BR>
That none in arms can rival me:<BR>
My strength the monarch shall abase,<BR>
And set thee, lord, in lordliest place.<BR>
These arms which breathe the sandal's<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  scent,<BR>
Which golden bracelets ornament,<BR>
These hands which precious gifts bestow,<BR>
Which guard the friend and smite the foe,<BR>
A nobler service shall assay,<BR>
And fight in R&aacute;ma's cause to-day,<BR>
The robbers of thy rights to stay.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Speak, brother, tell thy foeman's name<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Whom I, in conquering strife,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  May strip of followers and fame,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Of fortune, or of life.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Say, how may all this sea-girt land<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Be brought to own thy sway:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thy faithful servant here I stand<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To listen and obey.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then strove the bride of Raghu's race<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Sad Lakshman's heart to cheer,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  While slowly down the hero's face,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Unchecked, there rolled a tear.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  'The orders of my sire,' he cried,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    'My will shall ne'er oppose:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  I follow still, whate'er betide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The path which duty shows.'<BR>

<P>
