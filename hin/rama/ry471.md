### CANTO LXXV.: THE NIGHT ATTACK.

Sugríva spake in words like these:  
'Now, Vánar lords, the occasion seize.  
For now, of sons and brothers reft,  
To Rávan little hope is left:  
And if our host his gates assail  
His weak defence will surely fail.'  

At dead of night the Vánar bands  
Rushed on with torches in their hands.  
Scared by the coming of the host  
Each giant warder left his post.  
Where'er the Vánar legions came  
Their way was marked with hostile flame  
That spread in fury to devour  
Palace and temple, gate and tower.  
Down came the walls and porches, down  
Came stately piles that graced the town.  
In many a house the fire was red,  
On sandal wood and aloe fed.  
And scorching flames in billows rolled  
O'er diamonds and pearls and gold.  
On cloth of wool, on silk brocade,  
On linen robes their fury preyed.  
Wheels, poles and yokes were burned, and all  
The coursers' harness in the stall;  
And elephants' and chariots' gear,  
The sword, the buckler, and the spear.  
Scared by the crash of falling beams,  
Mid lamentations, groans and screams  

Forth rushed the giants through the flames  
And with them dragged bewildered dames,  
Each, with o'erwhelming terror wild,  
Still clamping to her breast a child.  
The swift fire from a cloud of smoke  
Through many a gilded lattice broke,  
And, melting pearl and coral, rose  
O'er balconies and porticoes.  
The startled crane and peacock screamed  
As with strange light the courtyard gleamed,  
And fierce unusual glare was thrown.  
Cm shrinking wood and heated stone.  
From burning stall and stable freed  
Rushed frantic elephant and steed.  
And goaded by the driving blaze  
Fled wildly tbrough the crowded ways.  
As earth with fervent heat will glow  
When comes her final overthrow;  
From gate to gate, from court to spire  
Proud Lanká was one blaze of fire,  
And every headland, rock and bay  
Shone bright a hundred leagues away.  
Forth, blinded by the heat and flame  
Ran countless giants huge of frame;  
And, mustering for fierce attack,  
The Vánars charged to drive them back,  
While shout and scream and roar and cry  
Reëchoed through the earth and sky.  
There Rama stood with stength renewed,  
And ever, as the foe he viewed,  
Shaking the distant regions rang  
His mighty bow's tremendous clang.  
Then through the gates Nikummbha hied,  
And Kumbha by his brother's side,  
Sent forth--the bravest and the best--  
To battle by the king's behest.  
There fought the chiefs in open field,  
And Angad fell and Dwivid reeled.  
Sugríva saw: by rage impelled  
He crushed the bow which Kumbha held.  
About his foe Sugríva wound  
His arms, and, heaving from the ground  
The giant hurled him o'er the bank;  
And deep beneath the sea he sank.  
Like mandar hill with furious swell  
Up leapt the waters where he fell.  
Again he rose: he sprang to land  
And raised on high his threatening hand:  
Full on Sugríva's chest it came  
And shook the Vánar's massy frame,  
But on the wounded bone he broke  
His wrist--so furious was the stroke.  
With force that naught could stay or check,  
Sugríva smote him neath the neck.  
The fierce blow crashed through flesh and bone  
And Kumbha lay in death o'erthrown.  
Nikumbha saw his brother die,  
And red with fury flashed his eye.  
He dashed with mighty sway and swing  

<span id="page_487">p. 487</span>  

His axe against the Vánar king;  
But shattered on that living rock  
It split in fragments at the shock.  
Sugríva, rising to the blow,  
Raised his huge hand and smote his foe.  
And in the dust the giant lay  
Gasping in blood his soul away.  <span
