### CANTO LXII: RÁVAN'S REQUEST

Along bright Lanká's royal road  
The giant, roused from slumber, strode,  
While from the houses on his head  
A rain of fragrant flowers was shed.  
He reached the monarch's gate whereon  
Rich gems and golden fretwork shone.  
Through court and corridor that shook  
Beneath his tread his way he took,  
And stood within the chamber where  
His brother sat in dark despair.  
But sudden, at the grateful sight  
The monarch's eye again grew bright.  
He started up, forgot his fear,  
And drew his giant brother near.  
The younger pressed the elder's feet  
And paid the King observance meet,  
Then cried: 'O Monarch, speak thy will,  
And let my care thy word fulfil.  
What sudden terror and dismay  
Have burst the bonds in which I lay?'  
Fierce flashed the flame from Rávan's eye.  
As thus in wrath he made reply:  
' Fair time, I ween, for sleep is this,  
To lull thy soul in tranquil bliss,  
Unheeding, in oblivion drowned,  
The dangers that our lives surround.  
Brave Ráma, Das'aratha's son,  
A passage o'er the sea has won,  
And, with the Vánar monarch's aid.  
Round Lanká's walls his hosts arrayed.  
Though never in the deadly field  
My Rákshas troops were known to yield,  
The bravest of the giant train  
Have fallen by the Vánars slain.  
Hence comes my fear. O fierce and brave,  
Go forth, our threatened Lanká' save.  
Go forth, a dreadful vengeance take:  
For this, O chief, I bade thee wake.  
The Gods and trembling fiends have felt  
The furious blows thine arm has dealt.  
Earth has no warrior, heaven has none  
To match thy might, Paulastya's eon,'
