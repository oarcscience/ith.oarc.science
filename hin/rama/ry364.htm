<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXII.: R&Aacute;VAN'S THREAT.</H3>
<P>
Then anger swelled in R&aacute;van's breast,<BR>
Who fiercely thus the dame addressed:<BR>
'Tis ever thus: in vain we sue<BR>
To woman, and her favour woo.<BR>
A lover's humble words impel<BR>
Her wayward spirit to rebel.<BR>
The love of thee that fills my soul<BR>
Still keeps my anger in control.<BR>
As charioteers with bit and rein<BR>
The swerving of the steed restrain.<BR>
The love that rules me bids me spare<BR>
Thy forefeit life, O thou most fair.<BR>
For this, O S&iacute;t&aacute;, have I borne<BR>
The keen reproach, the bitter scorn,<BR>
And the fond love thou boastest yet<BR>
For that poor wandering anchoret;<BR>
Else had the words which thou hast said<BR>
Brought death upon thy guilty head.<BR>
Two months, fair dame, I grant thee still<BR>
To bend thee to thy lover's will.<BR>
If when that respite time is fled<BR>
Thou still refuse to share my bed,<BR>
My cooks shall mince thy limbs with steel<BR>
And serve thee for my morning meal.' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_839"></A><A HREF="#fn_839"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The minstrel daughters of the skies<BR>
Looked on her woe with pitying eyes,<BR>
And sun-bright children of the Gods &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_840"></A><A HREF="#fn_840"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Consoled the queen with smiles and nods.<BR>
She saw, and with her heart at ease,<BR>
Addressed the fiend in words like these;<BR>
'Hast thou no friend to love thee, none<BR>
In all this isle to bid thee shun<BR>
The ruin which thy crime will bring<BR>
On thee and thine, O impious King?<BR>
Who in all worlds save thee could woo<BR>
Me, R&aacute;ma's consort pure and true,<BR>
As though he tempted with his love<BR>
Queen Sach&iacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_841"></A><A HREF="#fn_841"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> on her throne above?<BR>
How canst thou hope, vile wretch, to fly<BR>
The vengeance that e'en now is nigh,<BR>
When thou hast dared, untouched by shame,<BR>
To press thy suit on R&aacute;ma's dame?<BR>
Where woods are thick and grass is high<BR>
A lion and a hare may lie;<BR>
My R&aacute;ma is the lion, thou<BR>
Art the poor hare beneath the bough,<BR>
Thou railest at the lord of men.<BR>
But wilt not stand within his ken,<BR>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
What! is that eye unstricken yet<BR>
Whose impious glance on me was set?<BR>
Still moves that tongue that would not spare<BR>
The wife of Das'aratha's heir?'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then, hissing like a furious snake,<BR>
The fiend again to S&iacute;t&aacute; spake:<BR>
'Deaf to all prayers and threats art thou,<BR>
Devoted to thy senseless vow.<BR>
No longer respite will I give,<BR>
And thou this day shalt cease to live;<BR>
Now I, as sunlight kills the morn,<BR>
Will slay thee for thy scathe and scorn.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The R&aacute;kshas guard was summoned: all<BR>
The monstrous crew obeyed the call,<BR>
And hastened to the king to take<BR>
The orders which he fiercely spake:<BR>
'See that ye guard her well, and tame,<BR>
Like some wild thing, the stubborn dame,<BR>
Until her haughty boul be bent<BR>
By mingled threat and blandishment.' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_842"></A><A HREF="ry365.htm#fn_842"><FONT SIZE="1">1b</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The monsters heard: away he strode,<BR>
And passed within his queens' abode.<BR>
