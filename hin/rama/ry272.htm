<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO LXXIV.: KABANDHA'S DEATH.</H3>
<P>
When wise Kabandha thus had taught<BR>
The means to find the dame they sought,<BR>
And urged them onward in the quest,<BR>
He thus again the prince addressed:<BR>
&nbsp; 'This path, O Raghu's son, pursue<BR>
Where those fair trees which charm the view,<BR>
Extending westward far away,<BR>
The glory of their bloom display,<BR>
Where their bright leaves Rose-apples show,<BR>
And the tall Jak and Mango grow.<BR>
Whene'er you will, those trees ascend,<BR>
Or the long branches shake and bend.<BR>
Their savoury fruit like Amrit eat,<BR>
Then onward speed with willing feet.<BR>
Beyond this shady forest, decked<BR>
With flowering trees, your course direct.<BR>
Another grove you then will find<BR>
With every joy to take the mind,<BR>
Like Nandan with its charms displayed,<BR>
Or Northern Kuru's blissful shade;<BR>
Where trees distil their balmy juice.<BR>
And fruit through all the year produce;<BR>
Where shades with seasons ever fair<BR>
With Chaitraratha may compare:<BR>
Where trees whose sprays with fruit are bowed<BR>
Rise like a mountain or a cloud.<BR>
There, when you list, from time to time,<BR>
The loaded trees may Lakshman climb,<BR>
Or from the shaken boughs supply<BR>
Sweet fruit that may with Amrit vie.<BR>
The onward path pursuing still<BR>
From wood to wood, from hill to hill,<BR>
Your happy eyes at length will rest<BR>
On Pamp&aacute;'s lotus-covered breast.<BR>

<P>
Her banks with gentle slope descend,<BR>
Nor stones nor weed the eyes offend,<BR>
And o'er smooth beds of silver sand<BR>
Lotus and lily blooms expand.<BR>
There swans and ducks and curlews play,<BR>
And keen-eyed ospreys watch their prey,<BR>
And from the limpid waves are heard<BR>
Glad notes of many a water-bird.<BR>
Untaught a deadly foe to fear<BR>
They fly not when a man is near,<BR>
And fat as balls of butter they<BR>
Will, when you list, your hunger stay.<BR>
Then Lakshman with his shafts will take<BR>
The fish that swim the brook and lake,<BR>
Remove each bone and scale and fin,<BR>
Or strip away the speckled skin,<BR>
And then on iron skewers broil<BR>
For thy repast the savoury spoil.<BR>
Thou on a heap of flowers shalt rest<BR>
And eat the meal his hands have dressed<BR>
There shalt thou lie on Pamp&aacute;'s brink.<BR>
And Lakshman's hand shall give thee drink,<BR>
Filling a lotus leaf with cool<BR>
Pure water from the crystal pool,<BR>
To which the opening blooms hare lent<BR>
The riches of divinest scent.<BR>
Beside thee at the close of day<BR>
Will Lakshman through the woodland stray,<BR>
And show thee where the monkeys sleep<BR>
In caves beneath the mountain steep.<BR>
Lurd-voiced as bulls they forth will burst<BR>
And seek the flood, oppressed by thirst;<BR>
Then rest a while, their wants supplied,<BR>
Their well-fed bands on Pamp&aacute;'s side.<BR>
Thou roving there at eve shalt see<BR>
Rich clusters hang on shrub and tree,<BR>
And Pamp&aacute; flushed with roseate glow,<BR>
And at the view forget thy woe.<BR>
There shalt thou mark with strange delight<BR>
Each loveliest flower that blooms by night,<BR>
While lily buds that shrink from day<BR>
Their tender loveliness display.<BR>
In that far wild no hand but thine<BR>
Those peerless flowers in wreaths shall twine:<BR>
Immortal in their changeless pride,<BR>
Ne'er fade those blooms and ne'er are dried.<BR>
There erst on holy thoughts intent<BR>
Their days Matanga's pupils spent.<BR>
Once for their master food they sought,<BR>
And store of fruit and berries brought.<BR>
Then as they laboured through the dell<BR>
From limb and brow the heat-drops fell:<BR>
Thence sprang and bloomed those wondrous trees:<BR>
Such holy power have devotees.<BR>
Thus, from the hermits' heat-drops sprung,<BR>
Their growth is ever fresh and young.<BR>
There S'avar&iacute; is dwelling yet,<BR>
Who served each vanished anchoret.<BR>

<P>
Beneath the shade of holy boughs<BR>
That ancient votaress keeps her vows.<BR>
Her happy eyes on thee will fall,<BR>
O godlike prince, adored by all,<BR>
And she, whose life is pure from sin,<BR>
A blissful seat in heaven will win.<BR>
But cross, O son of Raghu, o'er,<BR>
And stand on Pampa's western shore.<BR>
A tranquil hermitage that lies<BR>
Deep in the woods will meet thine eyes.<BR>
No wandering elephants invade<BR>
The stillness of that holy shade,<BR>
But checked by saint Matanga's power<BR>
They spare each consecrated bower.<BR>
Through many an age those trees have stood<BR>
World-famous as Matanga's wood<BR>
Still, Raghu's son, pursue thy way:<BR>
Through shades where birds are vocal stray,<BR>
Fair as the blessed wood where rove<BR>
Immortal Gods, or Nandan's grove.<BR>
Near Pampa eastward, full in sight,<BR>
Stands Rishyamuka's wood-crowned height.<BR>
'Tis hard to climb that towering steep<BR>
Where serpents unmolested sleep.<BR>
The free and bounteous, formed of old<BR>
By Brahma, of superior mould,<BR>
Who sink when day is done to rest<BR>
Reclining on that mountain crest,<BR>
What wealth or joy in dreams they view<BR>
Awaking find the vision true.<BR>
But if a villain stained with crime<BR>
That holy hill presume to climb,<BR>
The giants in their fury sweep<BR>
From the hill top the wretch asleep.<BR>
There loud and long is heard the loar<BR>
Of elephants on Pampa's shore.<BR>
Who near Matanga's dwelling stray<BR>
And in those waters bathe and play.<BR>
A while they revel by the flood,<BR>
Their temples stained with streams like blood.<BR>
Then wander far away dispersed,<BR>
Dark as huge clouds before they burst.<BR>
But ere they part they drink their fill<BR>
Of bright pure water from the rill.<BR>
Delightful to the touch, where meet<BR>
Scents of ail flowers divinely sweet,<BR>
Then speeding from the river side<BR>
Deep in the sheltering thicket hide.<BR>
Then bears and tigers shalt thou view<BR>
Whose soft skins show the sapphire's hue,<BR>
And silvan deer that wander, nigh<BR>
Shall harmless from thy presence fly.<BR>
High in  that mountains wooded side<BR>
Is a fair cavern deep and wide,<BR>
Yet hard to enter: piles of rock<BR>
The portals-of the cavern block.' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_522"></A><A HREF="#fn_522"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
By the eastern door a pool<BR>
Gleams with broad waters fresh and cool,<BR>
Where stores of roots and fruit abound,<BR>
And thick trees shade the grassy ground.<BR>
This mountain cave the virtuous-souled<BR>
Sugr&iacute;va, and his V&aacute;nars hold,<BR>
And oft the mighty chieftain seeks<BR>
The summits of those towering peaks,'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus spake Kabandha. high in air<BR>
His counsel to the royal pair,<BR>
Still on his neck that wreath he bore,<BR>
And radiance like the sun's he wore,<BR>
Their eyes the princely brothers raised<BR>
And on that blissful being gazed:<BR>
'Behold, we go: no more delay;<BR>
Begin,' they cried,'thy heavenward way.'<BR>
'Depart,' Kabandha's voice replied,<BR>
'Pursue your search, and bliss betide.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thus to the happy chiefs he said,<BR>
Then on his heavenward journey sped:<BR>
&nbsp; Thus once again Kahandha won<BR>
A shape that glittered like the sun<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Without a spot or stain.<BR>
Thus bade he R&aacute;ma from the air<BR>
To great Sugr&iacute;va's side repair<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  His friendly love to gain.<BR>
