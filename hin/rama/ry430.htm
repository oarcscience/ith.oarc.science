<P>
The tyrant's troubled eye confessed<BR>
The secret fear that filled his breast.<BR>
With dread of coming woe dismayed<BR>
He called his counsellors to aid;<BR>
Then sternly silent, deep in thought,<BR>
His chamber in the palace sought.<BR>
Then, as the surest hope of all,<BR>
The monarch bade his servants call<BR>

Vidyujjihva, whom magic skill<BR>
Made master of the means of ill.<BR>
Then spake the lord of Lanka's isle:<BR>
&nbsp; 'Come, Sita with thine arts beguile.<BR>
With magic skill and deftest care<BR>
A head like R&aacute;ma's own prepare.<BR>
This head, long shafts and mighty bow,<BR>
To Janak's daughter will we show.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  He ceased. Vidyujjihva obeyed,<BR>
And wondrous magic skill displayed;<BR>
And R&aacute;van for the art he showed<BR>
An ornament of price bestowed.<BR>
Then to the grove where Sit&aacute; lay<BR>
The lord of Lank&aacute; took his way.<BR>
Pale, wasted, weeping, on the ground<BR>
The melancholy queen he found,<BR>
Whose thoughts in utmost stress of ill<BR>
Were fixed upon her husband still.<BR>
The giant king approached the dame,<BR>
Declared in tones of joy his name;<BR>
Then heeding naught her wild distress<BR>
Bespake her, stern and pitiless:<BR>
&nbsp; "The prince to whom thy fancies cling<BR>
Though loved and wooed by Lank&aacute;'s king,<BR>
Who slew the noble Khara,--he<BR>
Is slain by warriors sent by me.<BR>
Thy living root is hewn away.<BR>
Thy scornful pride is tamed to-day.<BR>
Thy lord in battle's front has died,<BR>
And Sit&aacute; shall be R&aacute;van's bride.<BR>
Hence, idle thoughts: thy hope is fled;<BR>
What wilt thou, Sit&aacute;, with the dead?<BR>
Rise, child of Janak, rise and be<BR>
The queen of all my queens and me.<BR>
Incline thine ear, and I will tell,<BR>
Dear lady, how thy husband fell.<BR>
He bridged his way across the sea<BR>
With countless troops to fight with me.<BR>
The setting sun had flushed the west<BR>
When on the shore they took their rest.<BR>
Weary with toil no watch they kept,<BR>
Securely on the sand they slept.<BR>
Prahasta's troops assailed our foes,<BR>
And smote them in their deep repose.<BR>
Scarce could their bravest prove their might;<BR>
They perished in the dark of night.<BR>
Axe, spear, and sword, directed well,<BR>
Upon the sleeping myriads fell.<BR>
First in the fight Prahasta's sword<BR>
Reft of his head thy slumbering lord,<BR>
Roused at the din Vibh&iacute;shan rose,<BR>
The captive of surrounding foes,<BR>
And Lakshman through the woods that spread<BR>
Around him with his V&aacute;nars fled.<BR>
Hanum&aacute;n fell: one deadly stroke<BR>
The neck of King Sugriva broke<BR>
And Maunta sank, and Dwivil lay<BR>
Gasping in hand his life away.<BR>
The V&aacute;nars died, or fled dispersed<BR>

<P>
Like cloudlets when the storm has burst.<BR>
Some rose aloft in air, and more<BR>
Ran to the sea and filled the shore.<BR>
On shore, in woods, on hill and plain<BR>
Our conquering giants left the slain.<BR>
Thus my victorious host o'erthrew<BR>
The Vanars, and thy husband slew:<BR>
See, rudely stained with dust, and red <BR>
With dropping blood, the severed head."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then, turning to a R&aacute;kshas slave,<BR>
The ruthless king his mandate gave;<BR>
And straight Vidyujjihva who bore<BR>
The head still wet with dripping gore,<BR>
The arrows and the mighty bow,<BR>
Bent down before his master low.<BR>
&nbsp; 'Vidyujjihva,' cried R&aacute;van, 'place<BR>
The head before the lady's'face,<BR>
And let her see with weeping eyes<BR>
That low in death her husband lies.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Before the queen the giant laid<BR>
The beauteous head his art had made.<BR>
And Ravan cried: 'Thine eyes will know<BR>
These arrows and the mighty bow.<BR>
With fame of this by R&aacute;ma strung<BR>
The earth and heaven and hell have rung.<BR>
Prahasta brought it hither when<BR>
His hand had slain thy prince of men.<BR>
Now, widowed Queen, thy hopes resign:<BR>
Forget thy husband and be mine.'<BR>

<P><A NAME="fn_953"></A><A HREF="ry429.htm#fr_953">450:1</A>  I omit the rest of this canto, which is
mere repetition. R&aacute;van gives in the same
words his former answer that the Gods,
Gandharvas and fiends combined shall
not force him to give up Sit&aacute;. He then
orders S'&aacute;rd&uacute;la to tell him the names of
the V&aacute;nar chieftains whom he has seen in
R&aacute;ma's army. These have already been
mentioned by S'uka and S&aacute;ran.</P>
