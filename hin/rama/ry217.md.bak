### CANTO XIX.: THE ROUSING OF KHARA.

When Khara saw his sister lie  
With blood-stained limbs and troubled eye,  

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>  

Wild fury in his bosom woke,  
And thus the monstrous giant spoke;  
   'Arise, my sister; cast away  
This numbing terror and dismay,  
And straight the impious hand declare  
That marred those features once so fair.  
For who his finger tip will lay  
On the black snake in childish play,  
And unattacked, with idle stroke  
His poison-laden fang provoke?  
Ill-fated fool, he little knows  
Death's noose around his neck he throws,  
Who rashly met thee, and a draught  
Of life-destroying poison quaffed.  
Strong, fierce as death, 'twas thine to choose  
Thy way at will, each shape to use;  
In power and might like one of us:  
What hand has maimed and marred thee thus?  
What God or fiend this deed has wrought,  
What bard or sage of lofty thought  
Was armed with power supremely great  
Thy form to mar and mutilate?  
In all the worlds not one I see  
Would dare a deed to anger me:  
Not Indra's self, the Thousand-eyed,  
Beneath whose hand fierce Páka  <span id="fr_459"></span>[1](#fn_459.md)
died.  
My life-destroying darts this day  
His guilty breath shall rend away,  
E'en as the thirsty wild swan drains  
Each milk-drop that the wave retains.  
Whose blood in foaming streams shall burst  
O'er the dry ground which lies athirst,  
When by my shafts transfixed and slain  
He falls upon the battle plain?  
From whose dead corpse shall birds of air  
The mangled flesh and sinews tear,  
And in their gory feast delight,  
When I have slain him in the fight?  
Not God or bard or wandering ghost,  
No giant of our mighty host  
Shall step between us, or avail  
To save the wretch when I assail.  
Collect each scattered sense, recall  
Thy troubled thoughts, and tell me all.  
What wretch attacked thee in the way,  
And quelled thee in victorious fray?'  
   His breast with burning fury fired,  
Thus Khara of the fiend inquired:  
And then with many a tear and sigh  
Thus S'úrpanakhá made reply:  
   ''Tis Das'aratha's sons, a pair  
Strong, resolute, and young, and fair:  
In coats of dark and blackdeer's hide,  
And like the radiant lotus eyed:  
On berries roots and fruit they feed,  
And lives of saintly virtue lead:  
With ordered senses undefiled,  
Ráma and Lakshman are they styled.  

Fair as the Minstrels' King  <span
id="fr_460"></span>[1b](ry218.htm#fn_460.md) are they,  
And stamped with signs of regal sway.  
I know not if the heroes trace  
Their line from Gods or Dánav <span
id="fr_461"></span>[2b](ry218.htm#fn_461.md) race.  
There by these wondering eyes between  
The noble youths a dame was seen,  
Fair, blooming, young, with dainty waist,  
And all her bright apparel graced.  
For her with ready heart and mind  
The royal pair their strength combined,  
And brought me to this last distress,  
Like some lost woman, comfortless.  
Perfidious wretch! my soul is fain  
Her foaming blood and theirs to drain.  
O let me head the vengeful fight,  
And with this hand my murderers smite.  
Come, brother, hasten to fulfil  
This longing of my eager will.  
On to the battle! Let me drink  
Their lifeblood as to earth they sink.'  
   Then Khara, by his sister pressed,  
Inflamed with fury, gave his hest  
To twice seven giants of his crew,  
Fierce as the God of death to view:  
   'Two men equipped with arms, who wear  
Deerskin and bark and matted hair,  
Leading a beauteous dame, have strayed  
To the wild gloom of Dandak's shade.  
These men, this cursed woman slay,  
And hasten back without delay,  
That this my sister's lips may be  
Red with the lifeblood of the three.  
Giants, my wounded sister longs  
To take this vengeance for her wrongs.  
With speed her dearest wish fulfil,  
And with your might these creatures kill.  
Soon as your matchless strength shall lay  
These brothers dead in battle fray,  
She in triumphant joy will laugh,  
And their hearts' blood delighted quaff.'  
   The giants heard the words he said,  
And forth with S'úrpanakhá sped,  
As mighty clouds in autumn fly  
Urged by the wind along the sky.
