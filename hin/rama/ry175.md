### CANTO XCVII.: LAKSHMAN'S ANGER.

Thus Ráma showed his love the rill  
Whose waters ran beneath the hill,  
Then resting on his mountain seat  
Refreshed her with the choicest meat.  
So there reposed the happy two:  
Then Bharat's army nearer drew:  
Rose to the skies a dusty cloud,  
The sound of trampling feet was loud.  
The swelling roar of marching men  
Drove the roused tiger from his den,  
And scared amain the serpent race  
Flying to hole and hiding-place.  
The herds of deer in terror fled,  
The air was filled with birds o'erhead,  
The bear began to leave his tree,  
The monkey to the cave to flee.  
Wild elephants were all amazed  
As though the wood around them blazed.  
The lion oped his ponderous jaw,  
The buffalo looked round in awe.  
The prince, who heard the deafening sound.  
And saw the silvan creatures round  
Fly wildly startled from their rest,  
The glorious Lakshman thus addressed:  
'Sumitrá's noble son most dear,  
Hark, Lakshman, what a roar I hear,  
The tumult of a coming crowd.  
Appalling, deafening, deep, and loud!  
The din that yet more fearful grows  
Scares elephants and buffaloes,  
Or frightened by the lions, deer  
Are flying through the wood in fear.  
I fain would know who seeks this place:  
Comes prince or monarch for the chase?  
Or does some mighty beast of prey  
Frighten the silvan herds away?  
Tis hard to reach this mountain height,  
Yea, e'en for birds in airy flight.  
Then fain, O Lakshman, would I know  
What cause disturbs the forest so.'  

Lakshman in haste, the wood to view.  
Climbed a high Sál that near him grew,  
The forest all around he eyed,  
First gazing on the eastern side.  
Then northward when his eyes he bent  
He saw a mighty armament  
Of elephants, and cars, and horse,  
And men on foot, a mingled force,  
And banners waving in the breeze,  
And spoke to Ráma words like these:  
'Quick, quick, my lord, put out the fire,  
Let Sítá to the cave retire.  

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>  

Thy coat of mail around thee throw,  
Prepare thine arrows and thy bow.'  

In eager haste thus Lakshman cried,  
And Ráma, lion lord, replied:  
'Still closer be the army scanned,  
And say who leads the warlike band.'  
Lakshman his answer thus returned,  
As furious rage within him burned,  
Exciting him like kindled fire  
To scorch the army in his ire:  
'Tis Bharat: be has made the throne  
By consecrating rites his own:  
To gain the whole dominion thus  
He comes in arms to slaughter us.  
I mark tree-high upon his car  
His flagstaff of the Kovídár,  <span id="fr_376"></span>[1](#fn_376)  
I see his glittering banner glance,  
I see his chivalry advance:  
I see his eager warriors shine  
On elephants in lengthened line.  
Now grasp we each the shafts and bow,  
And higher up the mountain go.  
Or in this place, O hero, stand  
With weapons in each ready hand.  
Perhaps beneath our might may fall  
This leader of the standard tall,  
And Bharat I this day may see  
Who brought this mighty woe on thee,  
Sítá, and me, who drove away  
My brother from the royal sway.  
Bharat our foe at length is nigh,  
And by this hand shall surely die:  
Brother, I see no sin at all  
If Bharat by my weapon fall.  
No fault is his who slays the foe  
Whose hand was first to strike the blow:  
With Bharat now the crime begins  
Who against thee and duty sins.  
The queen athirst for royal sway  
Will see her darling son to-day  
Fall by this hand, like some fair tree  
Struck by an elephant, slain by me.  
Kaikeyí's self shall perish too  
With kith and kin and retinue,  
And earth by my avenging deed  
Shall from this mass of sin be freed.  
This day my wrath, too long restrained,  
Shall fall upon the foe, unchained,  
Mad as the kindled flame that speeds  
Destroying through the grass and reeds.  
This day mine arrows keen and fierce  
The bodies of the foe shall pierce;  
The woods on Chitrakúta's side  
Shall run with torrents crimson-dyed.  
The wandering beasts of prey shall feed  
On heart-cleft elephant and steed,  
And drag to mountain caves away  
The bodies that my arrows slay.  
Doubt not that Bharat and his train  

Shall in this mighty wood be slain:  
So shall I pay the debt my bow  
And these my deadly arrows owe.
