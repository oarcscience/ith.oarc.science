<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CANTO XXXI.: LAKSHMAN'S PRAYER.</H3>
<P>
When Lakshman, who had joined them there,<BR>
Had heard the converse of the pair,<BR>
His mien was changed, his eyes o'erflowed,<BR>
His breast no more could bear its load.<BR>
The son of Raghu, sore distressed,<BR>
His brother's feet with fervour pressed,<BR>
While thus to Sita he complained.<BR>
And him by lofty vows enchained:<BR>
'If thou wilt make the woods thy home,<BR>
Where elephant and roebuck roam,<BR>
I too this day will take my bow<BR>
And in the path before thee go.<BR>
Our way will lie through forest ground<BR>
Where countless birds and beasts are found,<BR>
I heed not homes of Gods on high,<BR>
I heed not life that cannot die,<BR>
Nor would I wish, with thee away,<BR>
O'er the three worlds to stretch my sway.'<BR>

<P>
Thus Lakshman spake, with earnest prayer<BR>
His brother's woodland life to share.<BR>
As Rama still his prayer denied<BR>
With soothing words, again he cried:<BR>
'When leave at first thou didst accord,<BR>
Why dost thou stay me now, my lord?<BR>
Thou art my refuge: O, be kind,<BR>
Leave me not, dear my lord, behind.<BR>
Thou canst not, brother, if thou choose<BR>
That I still live, my wish refuse.'<BR>

<P>
The glorious chief his speech renewed<BR>
To faithful Lakshman as he sued,<BR>
And on the eyes of R&aacute;ma gazed<BR>
Longing to load, with hands upraised:<BR>
'Thou art a hero just and dear,<BR>
Whose steps to virtue's path adhere,<BR>
Loved as my life till life shall end.<BR>
My faithful brother and my friend.<BR>
If to the woods thou take thy way<BR>
With S&iacute;t&aacute; and with me to-day,<BR>
Who for Kaus'aly&aacute; will provide,<BR>
And guard the good Sumitra's side?<BR>
The lord of earth, of mighty power,<BR>
Who sends good things in plenteous shower,<BR>
As Indra pours the grateful rain,<BR>
A captive lies in passion's chain.<BR>
The power imperial for her son<BR>
Has As'vapati's daughter &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_306"></A><A HREF="#fn_306"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> won,<BR>
And she, proud queen, will little heed<BR>
Her miserable rivals' need.<BR>


<P>


<P>
So Bharat, ruler of the land,<BR>
By Queen Kaikey&iacute;'s side will stand,<BR>
Nor of those two will ever think.<BR>
While grieving in despair they sink.<BR>
Now, Lakshman, as thy love decrees,<BR>
Or else the monarch's heart to please,<BR>
Follow this counsel and protect<BR>
My honoured mother from neglect.<BR>
So thou, while not to me alone<BR>
Thy great affection will be shown,<BR>
To highest duty wilt adhere<BR>
By serving those thou shouldst revere.<BR>
Now, son of Raghu, for my sake<BR>
Obey this one request I make,<BR>
Or, of her darling son bereft,<BR>
Kausaly'&aacute; has no comfort left.'<BR>

<P>
The faithful Lakshman, thus addressed<BR>
In gentle words which love expressed,<BR>
To him in lore of language learned,<BR>
His answer, eloquent, returned:<BR>
'Nay, through thy might each queen will share<BR>
Attentive Bharat's love and care.<BR>
Should Bharat, raised as king to sway<BR>
This noblest realm, his trust betray,<BR>
Nor for their safety well provide,<BR>
Seduced by ill-suggesting pride,<BR>
Doubt not my vengeful hand shall kill<BR>
The cruel wretch who counsels ill--<BR>
Kill him and all who lend him aid,<BR>
And the three worlds in league arrayed.<BR>
And good Kausaly'&aacute; well can fee<BR>
A thousand champions like to me.<BR>
A thousand hamlets rich in grain<BR>
The station of that queen maintain.<BR>
She may, and my dear mother too,<BR>
Live on the ample revenue.<BR>
Then let me follow thee: herein<BR>
Is naught that may resemble sin.<BR>
So shall I in my wish suceed,<BR>
And aid, perhaps, my brother's need.<BR>
My bow and quiver well supplied<BR>
With arrows hanging at my side,<BR>
My hands shall spade and basket bear,<BR>
And for thy feet the way prepare.<BR>
I'll bring thee roots and berries sweet.<BR>
And woodland fare which hermits eat.<BR>
Thou shall with thy Videhan spouse<BR>
Recline upon the mountain's brows:<BR>
Be mine the toil, be mine to keep<BR>
Watch o'er thee waking or asleep.'<BR>

<P>
Filled by his speech with joy and pride<BR>
R&aacute;ma to Lakshman thus replied:<BR>
'Go then, my brother, bid adieu<BR>
To all thy friends and retinue.<BR>
And those two bows of fearful might,<BR>
Celestial, which, at that famed rite,<BR>
Lord Varun gave to Janak, king<BR>
Of fair Videha with thee bring,<BR>
With heavenly coats of sword-proof mail,<BR>
Quivers, whose arrows never fail,<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="page_132"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 132</FONT></A><BR>

<P>
And golden-hilted swords so keen,<BR>
The rivals of the sun in sheen.<BR>
Tended with care these arms are all<BR>
Preserved in my preceptor's hall.<BR>
With speed, O Lakshman, go, produce,<BR>
And bring them hither for our use.'<BR>
So on a woodland life intent,<BR>
To see his faithful friends he went,<BR>
And brought the heavenly arms which lay<BR>
By R&aacute;ma's teacher stored away,<BR>
And Raghu's son to R&aacute;ma showed<BR>
Those wondrous arms which gleamed and glowed,<BR>
Well kept, adorned with many a wreath<BR>
Of flowers on case, and hilt, and sheath.<BR>
The prudent R&aacute;ma at the sight<BR>
Addressed his brother with delight:<BR>
'Well art thou come, my brother dear.<BR>
For much I longed to see thee here.<BR>
For with thine aid, before I go,<BR>
I would my gold and wealth bestow<BR>
Upon the Br&aacute;hmans sage, who school<BR>
Their lives by stern devotion's rule.<BR>
And for all those who ever dwell<BR>
Within my house and serve me well,<BR>
Devoted servants, true and good,<BR>
Will I provide a livelihood.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Quick, go and summon to this place<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The good Vas'ishtha's son,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Suyajna, of the Br&aacute;hman race<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The first and holiest one.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To all the Br&aacute;hmans wise and good<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Will I due reverence pay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then to the solitary wood<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With thee will take my way.'<BR>
