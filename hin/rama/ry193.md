### CANTO CXV.: NANDIGRÁM.  <span id="fr_398"></span>[2](#fn_398)

Then when the pious chief had seen  
Lodged in her home each widowed queen,  
Still with his burning grief oppressed  
His holy guides he thus addressed:  
'I go to Nandigrám: adieu,  
This day, my lords to all of you:  
I go, my load of grief to bear,  
Reft of the son of Raghu, there.  
The king my sire, alas, is dead.  
And Ráma to the forest fled;  
There will I wait till he, restored,  
Shall rule the realm, its lightful lord.'  
   They heard the high-souled prince's speech,  
And thus with ready answer each  
Of those great lords their chief addressed.  

With saint Vas'ishtha and the rest:  
'Good are the words which thou hast said,  
By brotherly affection led,  
Like thine own self, a faithful friend,  
True to thy brother to the end:  
A heart like thine must all approve,  
Which naught from virtue's path can move,'  

Soon as the words he loved to hear  
Fell upon Bharat's joyful ear,  
Thus to the charioteer he spoke:  
'My car witn speed, Sumantra, yoke.'  
Tnen Bharat with delighted mien  
Obeisance paid to every queen,  
And with S'atrughna by his side  
Mounting the car away he hied.  
With lords, and priests in long array  
Tne brothers hastened on their way.  
And the great pomp the Bráhmans led  
With Saint Vas'ishtha at their head.  
Then every face was eastward bent  
As on to Nundigrám they went.  
Behind the army followed, all  
Unsummoned by their leader's call,  
And steeds and elephants and men  
Streamed forth with every citizen.  
As Bharat in his chariot rode  
His heart with love fraternal glowed,  
And with the sandals on his head  
To Nundigrám he quickly sped.  
Within the town he swiftly pressed,  
Alighted, and his guides addressed:  
'To me in trust my brother's hand  
Consigned the lordship of the land,  
When he these gold-wrought sandals gave  
As emblems to protect and save.'  
Then Bharat bowed, and from his head  
The sacred pledge deposited,  
And thus to all the people cried  
Who ringed him round on every side:  
'Haste, for these sandals quickly bring  
The canopy that shades the king.  
Pay ye to them all reverence meet  
As to my elder brother's feet,  
For they will right and law maintain  
Until King Ráma come again.  
My brother with a loving mind  
These sandals to my charge consigned:  
I till he come will guard with care  
The sacred trust for Raghu's heir.  
My watchful task will soon be done,  
The pledge restored to Raghu's son;  
Then shall I see, his wanderings o'er,  
These sandals on his feet once more.  
My brother I shall meet at last,  
The burthen from my shoulders cast,  
To Ráma's hand the realm restore  
And serve my elder as before.  
When Rama takes again this pair  
Of sandals kept with pious care,  
And here his glorious reign begins,  
I shall be cleansed from all my sins,  

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>  

When the glad people's voices ring  
With welcome to the new-made king,  
Joy will be mine four-fold as great  
As if supreme I ruled the state.'  

Thus humbly spoke in sad lament  
The chief in fame preëminent:  
Thus, by his reverent lords obeyed,  
At Nandigrám the kingdom swayed.  
With hermit's dress and matted hair  
He dwelt with all his army there.  
The sandals of his brother's feet  
Installed upon the royal seat,  
He, all his powers to them referred,  
Affairs of state administered.  
   In every care, in every task,  
     When golden store was brought,  
   He first, as though their rede to ask,  
    Those royal sandals sought.
