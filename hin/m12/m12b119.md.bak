### SECTION CCXCII

"Parasara said, 'That man who, having obtained this car, *viz*., his
body endued with mind, goes on, curbing with the reins of-knowledge the
steeds represented by the objects of the senses, should certainly be
regarded as possessed of intelligence. The homage (in the form of
devotion to and concentrated meditation on the Supreme) by a person
whose mind is dependent on itself and who has cast off the means of
livelihood is worthy of high praise,--that homage, namely, O regenerate
one, which is the result of instructions received from one who has
succeeded in transcending acts but not obtained from the mutual
discussion of men in the same state of progress. <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[2](#fn_1006.md) Having obtained the
[allotted](errata.htm#132.md) period of life, O king, with such difficulty,
one should not diminish it (by indulgence of the senses). On the other
hand, man should always exert, by righteous acts for his gradual
advancement. <span id="fr_1007"></span>[3](#fn_1007.md) Among the six
different colours that Jiva attains at different periods of his
existence, he who falls away from a superior colour deserves obloquy and
censure. Hence, one that has attained to the result of good acts should
conduct oneself in such a way as to avoid all acts stained by the
quality of Rajas. <span id="fr_1008"></span>[4](#fn_1008.md) Man

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

attains to a superior colour by righteous acts. Unable to acquire a
superior hue, for such acquisition is extremely difficult, a person, by
doing sinful acts only slays himself (by sinking into hell and falling
down into an inferior colour). All sinful acts that are committed
unconsciously or in ignorance are destroyed by penances. A sinful act,
however, that is committed knowingly, produces much sorrow. Hence, one
should never commit sinful acts which have for their fruit only sorrow.
The man of intelligence would never do an act that is sinful in
character even if it leads to the greatest advantage, just as a person
that is pure would never touch a Chandala. <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[1](#fn_1009.md) How miserable is the fruit I see of
sinful acts! Through sin the very vision of the sinner becomes perverse,
and he confounds his body and its unstable accompaniments with the
Soul. <span id="fr_1010"></span>[2](#fn_1010.md) That foolish man who does
not succeed in betaking himself to Renunciation in this world becomes
afflicted with great grief when he departs to the next world. <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[3](#fn_1011.md) An uncoloured cloth, when dirty, can
be cleaned, but not a piece of cloth that is dyed with black; even so, O
king, listen to me with care, is it the case with sin. That man who,
having knowingly committed sin, acts righteously for expiating that sin,
has to enjoy and endure the fruits of his good and bad acts
separately. <span id="fr_1012"></span>[4](#fn_1012.md) The utterers of
Brahma maintain, under the authority of what has been laid down in the
Vedas, that all acts of injury committed in ignorance are cancelled by
acts of righteousness. A sin, however, that is committed consciously is
never cancelled by righteousness. Thus say the regenerate utterers of
Brahma who are conversant with the scriptures of Brahmana. As regards
myself, my view is that whatever acts are done, be they righteous or
sinful, be they done knowingly or otherwise, remain (and are never
destroyed unless their fruits are enjoyed or endured). <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[5](#fn_1013.md) Whatever acts are done by the mind
with full deliberation, produce, according to their grossness or
subtility, fruits that are gross or subtile. <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[6](#fn_1014.md) Those acts, however, O thou of
righteous soul, which are fraught with great injury, if done in
ignorance, do without fail produce consequences and even consequences
that lead to hell, with this difference that those consequences are
disproportionate

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

in point of gravity to the acts that produce them. <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[1](#fn_1015.md) As to those acts (of a doubtful or
unrighteous nature) that may be done by the deities or ascetics of
reputation, a righteous man should never do their like or, informed of
them, should never censure them. <span id="fr_1016"></span>[2](#fn_1016.md)
That man who, reflecting with his mind, O king, and ascertaining his own
ability, accomplishes righteous acts, certainly obtains what is for his
benefit. Water poured into an unbaked vessel gradually becomes less and
finally escapes altogether. If kept, however, in a baked vessel, it
remains without its quantity being diminished. After the same manner,
acts done without reflection with the aid of the understanding do not
become beneficial; while acts done with judgment remain with
undiminished excellence and yield happiness as their result. If into a
vessel containing water other water be poured, the water that was
originally there increases in quantity; even so all acts done with
judgment, be they equitable or otherwise, only add to one's stock of
righteousness. A king should subjugate his foes and all who seek to
assert their superiority, and he should properly rule and protect his
subjects. One should ignite one's sacred fires and pour libations on
them in diverse sacrifices, and retiring in the woods into either one's
middle or old age, should live there (practising the duties of the two
last modes of life). Endued with self-restraint, and possessed of
righteous behaviour, one should look upon all creatures as on one's own
self. One should again reverence one's superiors. By the practice of
truth and of good conduct, O king, one is sure to obtain happiness.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1006"></span>[348:2](m12b119.htm#fr_1006.md) This is a very
abstruse verse. The grammatical construction of the first line is
*asritena manasa vrittihinasya seva sasyate*. *Asritena* is
*niralamvanena*. By *seva* is meant homage paid to the Supreme in the
form of devotion and concentrated meditation. It implies, of course, a
thorough reliance on God. *Vrittihina* is one who has cast off the means
of livelihood, implying one who abstains from worldly objects. In the
second line, *dwija* is a vocative. *Nirvritta* is *nishpanna*,
qualifying *seva*. *Atihastat* is 'from one who has transcended the use
of the hand, *i.e.*, the necessity of acts. *Atihastanirvritta*, means
'obtained-from a competent preceptor.' In brief, what is stated here is
that such *seva* should be learnt from competent preceptors and not by
discussion among persons in the stage of spiritual progress.

<span id="fn_1007"></span>[348:3](m12b119.htm#fr_1007.md) The object of
this verse, the commentator points out, is to show the desirability of
practising that *seva* soon or without loss of time.

<span id="fn_1008"></span>[348:4](m12b119.htm#fr_1008.md) In the discourse
of Sanatkumara to Vritra, these six colours have been mentioned, and the
nature of the acts by which one attains to a superior colour or falls
down from a superior to an inferior one. *Vide* Sec. 280, ante.

<span id="fn_1009"></span>[349:1](m12b119.htm#fr_1009.md) A particular kind
of *Chandala* is called *kusalin*.

<span id="fn_1010"></span>[349:2](m12b119.htm#fr_1010.md) *Pratyapannasya*
is *viparita-drishteh*. *Natma* is *dehadih*. *Tatah* is *papaddhetoh*.
*Virochate*, is *viseshena atmatwena rochate*.

<span id="fn_1011"></span>[349:3](m12b119.htm#fr_1011.md) *Pratyapattih* is
*Vairagyam* or Renunciation. As regards *Prasthitasya* it may be taken
either as implying one that is dead or one that has betaken himself to
Yoga. In the latter case, the verse would mean that that man who betakes
himself to Yoga without adopting Renunciation meets with much sorrow.

<span id="fn_1012"></span>[349:4](m12b119.htm#fr_1012.md) The object of
this verse is to show that conscious sin can never be destroyed by
expiation. The only means by which sin can be destroyed is by enduring
its fruits.

<span id="fn_1013"></span>[349:5](m12b119.htm#fr_1013.md) The Burdwan
translator makes utter nonsense of this verse. *Guna-yuktam* is
explained by the commentator as equivalent to *punyakarma*. *Prakasam*
is equivalent to *budhipurvakam prakasya* or *jnatwa*. It is formed by
the suffix *namul*.

<span id="fn_1014"></span>[349:6](m12b119.htm#fr_1014.md) *Yathatatham* is
*sthula-sukshma-taratamyena*. The sense is that all acts done knowingly
produce fruits according to their nature. If gross, the fruits produced
are gross; if subtile, the fruits produced are subtile.

<span id="fn_1015"></span>[350:1](m12b119.htm#fr_1015.md) The speaker's
opinion is that all acts are productive of fruits. If good, the fruits
are good. If bad, the fruits are bad. There is this difference, however,
between acts done knowingly and those done in ignorance: the former
produce commensurate fruits *i.e.*, if gross, their fruits are gross; if
subtile, the fruits are subtile; but the latter produce fruits that are
not so, so that even if heinous, the fruits do not involve a large but
only a small measure of misery. There is no other difference between the
two kinds of acts.

<span id="fn_1016"></span>[350:2](m12b119.htm#fr_1016.md) The object of
this verse is to show that such acts form the exception and they are
kept out of my sight in this discourse on acts. The Rishi Viswamitra
caused the death of the hundred sons of Vasishtha, and yet he had not to
go to hell for it.
