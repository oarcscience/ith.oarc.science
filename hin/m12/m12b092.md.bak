### SECTION CCLXV

"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited an old narrative of what was
recited by king Vichakhy through compassion for all creatures. Beholding
the mangled body of a bull, and hearing the exceedingly painful groans
of the kine in a cow-slaying sacrifice, and observing the cruel
Brahmanas that gathered there for assisting at the ceremonies, that
king <span id="fr_695"></span>[2](#fn_695.md) uttered these words,
'Prosperity to all the kine in the world.' When the slaughter had
commenced, these words expressive of a blessing (to those helpless
animals) were pronounced. And the monarch further said, 'Only those that
are transgressors of defined limits, that are destitute of intelligence,
that are atheists and sceptics, and that desire the acquisition of
celebrity through sacrifices and religious rites speak highly of the
slaughter of animals in sacrifices. <span
id="fr_696"></span>[3](#fn_696.md) The righteous-souled Manu has applauded
(the observance of) harmlessness in all (religious) acts. Indeed, men
slaughter animals in sacrifices, urged by only the desire of
fruit. <span id="fr_697"></span>[4](#fn_697.md) Hence, guided by authority
(in respect of slaughter and abstention from slaughter or harmlessness)
one conversant (with the scriptures) should practise the true course of
duty which is exceedingly subtile. Harmlessness to all creatures is the
highest of all duties. Living in the vicinity of an inhabited place and
injuring oneself to the observance of rigid vows, and disregarding the
fruits indicated of Vedic acts, one should give up domesticity, adopting
a life of Renunciation. Only they that are mean are urged by the desire
of

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

fruit. <span id="fr_698"></span>[1](#fn_698.md) Reverentially mentioning
sacrifices and trees and sacrificial stakes, men do not eat tainted
meat. This practice, however, is not worthy of applause. <span
id="fr_699"></span>[2](#fn_699.md) Wine, fish, honey, meat, alcohol, and
preparations of rice and sesame seeds, have been introduced by knaves.
The use of these (in sacrifices) is not laid down in the Vedas. The
hankering after these arises from pride, error of judgment, and
cupidity. They that are true Brahmanas realise the presence of Vishnu in
every sacrifice. His worship, it has been laid down, should be made with
agreeable Payasa. (The leaves and flowers of) such trees as have been
indicated in the Vedas, whatever act is regarded as worthy and whatever
else is held as pure by persons of pure hearts and cleansed natures and
those eminent for knowledge and holiness, are all worthy of being
offered to the Supreme Deity and not unworthy of His acceptance.' <span
id="fr_700"></span>[3](#fn_700.md)

"Yudhishthira said, 'The body and all sorts of dangers and calamities
are continually at war with each other. How, therefore, will a person
who is totally free from the desire of harming and who on this account
will not be able to act, succeed in keeping up his body?' <span
id="fr_701"></span>[4](#fn_701.md)

"Bhishma said, 'One should, when able, acquire merit and act in such a
way that one's body may not languish and suffer pain, and that death may
not come.'" <span id="fr_702"></span>[5](#fn_702.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_695"></span>[245:2](m12b092.htm#fr_695.md) *Gograhe* is
explained by the commentator as 'a sacrifice in which kine are stain.'
*Yajnavatasya* is an instance of the genitive for the accusative. It
means *Yajnavatsthan nirdayan Brahmanan*. The expression may also mean
'in the cow-pen within the sacrificial enclosure.'

<span id="fn_696"></span>[245:3](m12b092.htm#fr_696.md) *Avyaktaih* is
explained by the commentator as *Yajnadi-dwaraiva khyatimichchhadbhih*.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[245:4](m12b092.htm#fr_697.md) *Kamakara* may also
mean recklessness, *Vahirvedyam* is 'on the outer Vedi or altar.' The
actual slaughter takes place on this *vedi*. The Burdwan translator
misunderstands the word.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[246:1](m12b092.htm#fr_698.md) *Upasya*, is
explained by the commentator as 'living near an inhabited place.'
*Vedakritah Srutih* are the fruits indicated in the Vedas of the acts
laid, down in them. *Acharah* has reference to the duties of the
domestic mode of life. *Acharah* should be made *anacharah*, *i.e.*,
should not be followed. The Sannyasa mode of life is thus recommended.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[246:2](m12b092.htm#fr_699.md) The meaning is
this: ordinary men abstain from tainted meat, regarding all meat as
tainted which is obtained from animals that are not killed in sacrifices
and in course of religious acts. The speaker, however, holds that this
practise is not worthy of applause, for all meat is tainted, including
that of animals slain in sacrifices. K.P. Singha gives the sense
correctly though his rendering is not literal. The Burdwan translator,
misunderstanding text and commentary, jumbles them together and gives an
incorrect rendering.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[246:3](m12b092.htm#fr_700.md) Hence there is no
need for sacrifices with slaughter of animals, and alcohol, etc.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[246:4](m12b092.htm#fr_701.md) The sense is this:
dangers are always seeking to destroy the body. The body is always
seeking to destroy those destroyers. This perpetual war or struggle
implies the desire to injure. How then, asks Yudhishthira, is it
possible for any man to lead a perfectly harmless life, harm being
implied in the very fact of continued existence?

<span id="fn_702"></span>[246:5](m12b092.htm#fr_702.md) The sense, of
course, is that one should acquire religious merit without wasting one's
body; one should not, that is, cause one's body to be destroyed for the
sake of earning merit.
