### SECTION CLII

"Saunaka said, 'I shall for these reasons discourse to thee of
righteousness, to thee whose heart has been exceedingly agitated.
Possessed of knowledge and great strength, and with a contented heart,
thou seekest righteousness of thy own will. A king, first becoming
exceedingly stern, then shows compassion and does good to all creatures
by his acts. This is certainly very wonderful. People say that that king
who commences with sternness burns the whole world. Thou wert stern
before. But thou turnest thy eyes on righteousness now. Forsaking
luxurious food and all articles of enjoyment, thou hast betaken thyself
for a long time to rigid penances. All this, O Janamejaya, is certain to
appear wonderful to those kings that are sunk in sin. That he who has
affluence

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

should become liberal, or that he who is endued with wealth of
asceticism should become reluctant to spend it, is not at all wonderful.
It has been said that the one does not live at a distance from the
other. <span id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_442.md) That which is ill-judged
produces misery in abundance. That on the other hand, which is
accomplished with the aid of sound judgment leads to excellent
results. <span id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_443.md) Sacrifice, gift,
compassions, the Vedas, and truth, O lord of the earth--these five--are
cleansing. The sixth is penance well-performed. This last, O Janamejaya,
is highly cleansing for kings. By betaking thyself to it properly, thou
art certain to earn great merit and blessedness. Visiting sacred spots
has also been said to be highly cleansing. In this connection are cited
the following verses sung by Yayati: 'That mortal who would earn life
and longevity should, after having performed sacrifices with devotion,
renounce them (in old age) and practise penances.' The field of Kuru has
been said to be sacred. The river Saraswati has been said to be more so.
The *tirthas* of the Saraswati are more sacred than the Saraswati
herself; and the *tirtha* called Prithudaka is more sacred than all the
*tirthas* of the Saraswati. One that has bathed in Prithudaka. and drunk
its waters will not have to grieve for a premature death. Thou shouldst
go to *Mahasaras*, to all the *tirthas* designated by the name of
Pushkara, to Prabhasa, to the northern lake Manasa, and to Kalodaka.
Thou shalt then regain life and acquire longevity. Lake Manasa is on the
spot where the Saraswati and the Drisadwati mingle with each other. A
person possessed of Vedic knowledge should bathe in these places. Manu
has said that liberality is the best of all duties and that renunciation
is better than liberality. In this connection is cited the following
verse composed by Satyavat. (One should act) as a child full of
simplicity and destitute of either merit or sin. As regards all
creatures there is in this would neither misery nor happiness. (That
which is called misery and that which is called happiness are the
results of a [distraught](errata.htm#54) imagination..md) Even this is the
true nature of all living creatures. Of all creatures, their lives are
superior who have betaken themselves to renunciation and abstained from
acts both meritorious and sinful. I shall now tell thee those acts which
are best for a king. By putting forth thy might and liberality do thou
conquer heaven, O king! That man who possesses the attributes of might
and energy succeeds in attaining to righteousness. <span
id="fr_445"></span>[3](#fn_444.md) Do thou rule the earth, O king, for the
sake of the Brahmanas and for the sake of happiness. Thou usedst
formerly to condemn the Brahmanas. Do thou gratify them now. Though they
have cried fie on thee and though they have deserted thee, do thou
still, guided by knowledge of self, solemnly pledge thyself never to
injure them. Engaged in acts proper for thee, seek what is for thy
highest good.

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Amongst rulers some one becomes as cool as snow;
some one, as fierce as fire; some one becomes like a plough (uprooting
all enemies); and some one, again, becomes like a thunder-bolt (suddenly
scorching his foes). He who wishes to prevent self-destruction should
never mix with wicked wights for general or special reasons. From a
sinful act committed only once, one may cleanse one's self by repenting
of it. From a sinful act committed twice, one may cleanse one's self by
vowing never to commit it again. From such an act committed thrice, one
may cleanse one's self by the resolution to bear one's self righteously
ever afterwards. By committing such an act repeatedly, one may cleanse
one's self by a trip to sacred places. One who is desirous of obtaining
prosperity should do all that results in blessedness. They who live
amidst fragrant odours themselves become fragrant in consequence. They,
on the other hand, who live in the midst of foul stench themselves
become foul. One devoted to the practice of ascetic penances is soon
cleansed of all one's sins. By worshipping the (*homa*) fire for a year,
one stained by diverse sins becomes purified. One guilty of foeticide is
cleansed by worshipping the fire for three years. One guilty of
foeticide becomes cleansed at even a hundred *Yojanas* from Mahasaras,
or the *tirthas* called Pushkara, or Prabhasa, or Manasa on the north,
if only one gets out for any of them. <span
id="fr_446"></span>[1](#fn_445.md) A slayer of creatures is cleansed of his
sins by saying from imminent peril as many creatures of that particular
species as have been slain by him. Manu has said that by diving in water
after thrice reciting the *Aghamarshana* *mantras*, one reaps the fruits
of the final bath in a Horse-sacrifice. <span
id="fr_447"></span>[2](#fn_446.md) Such an act very soon cleanses one of
all one's sins, and one regains in consequence the esteem of the world.
All creatures become obedient to such a person like helpless idiots
(obedient to those that surround them). The gods and *Asuras*, in days
of yore, approaching the celestial preceptor Vrihaspati, O king, humbly
enquired of him, saying, 'Thou knowest, O great *Rishi*, the fruits of
virtue, as also the fruits of those other acts that lead to hell in the
next world. Does not that person succeed in liberating himself from both
merit and sin with whom the two (weal and woe) are equal? Tell us, O
great *Rishi*, what the fruits of righteousness are, and how does a
righteous person dispels his sins.'

"Vrihaspati answered, 'If having committed sin through folly, one does
meritorious acts understanding their nature, one succeeds, by such
righteousness, in cleansing one's self from sin even as a piece of dirty
cloth is washed clean by means of some saline substance. One should not
boast after having committed sin. By having recourse to faith and by
freeing one's self from malice, one succeeds in obtaining blessedness.
That person who covers the

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

faults, even when exposed, of good men, obtains blessedness even after
committing faults. As the sun rising at morn dispels darkness, one
dispels all ones sins by acting righteously.'

"Bhishma continued, 'Indrota, the son of Sunaka, having said these words
unto king Janamejaya, assisted him, by his ministrations, in the
performance of the horse-sacrifice. The king, cleansed of his sins and
regaining blessedness, shone with splendour like a blazing fire, and
that slayer of foes then entered his kingdom like Soma in his full form
entering heaven.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_442"></span>[333:1](m12a151.htm#fr_443.md) The version of 5 is
offered tentatively. That a person possessed of affluence should become
charitable is not wonderful. An ascetic, again, is very unwilling to
exercise his power. (Witness Agastya's unwillingness to create wealth
for gratifying his spouse.) What is meant by these two persons not
living at a distance from each other is that the same cause which makes
an affluent person charitable operates to make an ascetic careful of the
kind of wealth he has.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[333:2](m12a151.htm#fr_444.md) That which is
*asamikshitam* is *samagram karpanyam*.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[333:3](m12a151.htm#fr_445.md) Nilakantha explains
that *vala* here means patience (strength to bear) and *ojas* (energy)
means restraints of the senses.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[334:1](m12a151.htm#fr_446.md) Both the vernacular
translators nave rendered the second line of verse 25 wrongly. They seem
to think that a person by setting out for any of the sacred waters from
a distance of a hundred *yojanas* becomes cleansed. If this meaning be
accepted then no man who lives within a hundred *yojanas* of any of them
has any chance of being cleansed. The sense, of course, is that such is
the efficacy of these *tirthas* that a man becomes cleansed by
approaching even to a spot within a hundred *yojanas* of their several
sites.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[334:2](m12a151.htm#fr_447.md) These *mantras*
form a part of the morning, noon and evening prayer of every Brahmana.
Aghamarshana was a Vedic *Rishi* of great sanctity.
