### SECTION CCI

"Yudhishthira said, 'What are the fruits of the yoga represented by
Knowledge, of all the Vedas, and of the (various) observances and vows?
How also may the creature-soul be known? Tell us, this, O grandsire!'

"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the
discourse between that lord of creatures, *viz*., Manu, and the great
*Rishi*, Vrihaspati. In days of old, the foremost of celestial *Rishis*,
*viz*., Vrihaspati, who was a disciple of Manu, bowed to his preceptor
and addressing that lord and first of all creatures, said, 'What is the
cause (of the universe)? Whence have the ordinances (about sacrifices
and other pious observances) flowed? What are those fruits which the
learned say are attached to Knowledge? Tell me also truly, O illustrious
one, what is that which the very, Vedas have not been able to reveal?
What are those fruits which are adored by eminent personages conversant
with the science of *Artha*, with the Vedas, and with the *Mantras*,
through sacrifices and plentiful gifts of kine? Whence do those fruits
arise? Where are they to be found? Tell me also this old history,
*viz*., whence have the earth, all earthly objects, wind, sky, aquatic
creatures, water, heaven, and the denizens of heaven, all sprung? Man's
inclinations tend towards that object about which he seeks knowledge. I
have no knowledge of that Ancient and Supreme one. How shall I rescue
myself from a false display of inclinations towards Him? <span
id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_150.md) The *Riks*, all the *Samanas*, all the
*Yajuses*, the *Chhandas*, Astronomy, *Nirukta*, Grammar, *Sankalpa*,
and *Siksha*, I have studied. But I pave no knowledge of the nature of
the great creatures (the five primal elements) that enter into the
composition of everything. <span id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_151.md) Tell me
all I have asked thee, by using only simple assertions and
distinguishing

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

adjectives or attributes. Tell me what the fruits are of Knowledge and
what those fruits that are attached to sacrifices and other religious
rites. Explain to me how also an embodied being departs from his body
and how he attains to another body.'

"Manu said, 'That which is agreeable to one is said to constitute one's
happiness. Similarly, that which is disagreeable to one is said to
constitute one's misery.--By this I shall obtain happiness and keep off
misery--from a sentiment like this flow all religious acts. The efforts
for the acquisition of Knowledge, however, arise from a sentiment for
avoiding both happiness and misery. <span
id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_152.md) The ordinances about sacrifices and
other observances, that occur in the Vedas, are all connected with
desire. He, however, who liberates himself from desire, succeeds in
attaining to *Brahma*. That man who, from desire of winning happiness,
walks in the path of acts which are of diverse kinds, has to go to
hell.' <span id="fr_153"></span>[2](#fn_153.md)

"Vrihaspati said, 'Men's aspirations are concerned with the acquisition
of the agreeable which ends in happiness, and the avoidance of the
disagreeable which brings misery. Such acquisition and such avoidance
again are accomplished by acts.' <span id="fr_154"></span>[3](#fn_154.md)

"Manu said, 'It is by liberating oneself from acts that one succeeds in
entering into *Brahma*. The ordinances about acts have flowed for that
very end. <span id="fr_155"></span>[4](#fn_155.md) The ordinances about
acts tempts only those whose hearts are not free from desire. By
liberating oneself from acts (as already said) one acquires the highest
state. One desirous of felicity (Emancipation), betaking oneself to
religious rites, becomes purified (from attachments) by acts having for
their object the purification of the soul, and at last wins great
splendour. By liberating oneself from acts, one acquires the highest
end, *viz*., *Brahma*, which is very much above the reward that acts
give. Creatures have all been created by Mind and Act. These again are
the two best paths adored by all. Outward acts produce fruits that are
transitory as also eternal. For acquiring the latter there is no other
means than abandonment of fruits by the mind. <span
id="fr_156"></span>[5](#fn_156.md) As the eye, when night passes away and
the veil of darkness is removed from it, leads its possessor by its own
power, so the Understanding, when it

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

becomes endued with Knowledge, succeeds in beholding all evils that are
worthy of avoidance. <span id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_157.md) Snakes,
sharp-pointed *kusa* blades, and pits, men avoid when they perceive them
lie on their way. If some tread upon or fall into them, they do so
through ignorance. Behold the superiority of the fruits of knowledge
(over those of ignorance). *Mantras* applied duly, sacrifices, the
presents called *Dakshina*, gift of food, and concentration of the mind
(for divine contemplation),--these are the five acts that are said to be
productive of fruits, there being none else. Acts have (the three)
attributes (of *Sattwa*, *Rajas*, and *Tamas*) for their soul. The Vedas
say this. (The Vedas consist of *Mantras*). The *Mantras*, therefore,
have the same three attributes, since it is with *Mantras* that acts are
to be accomplished. The ritual also must be liable to the same three
attributes. The fruits of action depend upon the mind. It is the
embodied creature that enjoys those fruits. <span
id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_158.md) All excellent kinds of sound, form,
taste, touch, and scent, are the fruits of acts, being attainable in the
region of acts (*i.e.*, heaven). As regards, however, the fruits of
knowledge, man acquires them even here before death. <span
id="fr_159"></span>[3](#fn_159.md) Whatever acts are accomplished by means
of the body, one enjoys the fruits thereof in a state of physical
existence. The body is, indeed, the framework to which happiness
inheres, as also the framework to which misery inheres. <span
id="fr_160"></span>[4](#fn_160.md) Whatever acts are accomplished by means
of words, their fruits are to be enjoyed in a state in which words can
be spoken. Similarly, whatever acts are accomplished by the mind, their
fruits are enjoyed in a state in which one is not freed from the
mind. <span id="fr_161"></span>[5](#fn_161.md) Devoted to the fruits of
acts, whatever kind of acts (*Sattwika* or

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *Rajasika* or *Tamasika*) a person covetous of
fruits accomplishes, the fruits, good or bad, that he actually enjoys
partake of their character. Like fishes going against a current of
water, the acts of a past life come to the actor. The embodied creature
experiences happiness for his good acts, and misery for his evil ones.
Him from whom this universe hath sprung. Him by knowing whom persons of
cleansed souls transgress this world, Him who has not been expressed by
Vedic *mantras* and words. I will now indicate. Listen to me as I speak
of that highest of the high. Himself liberated from the several kinds of
taste and scent, and sound and touch and form. He is incapable of being
grasped by the senses, unmanifest, without colour, the One, and He has
created the five kinds of objects <span id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_162.md)
for His creatures. He is neither female, nor male, nor of the neuter
sex. He is neither existent, nor non-existent, nor
existent-nonexistent. <span id="fr_163"></span>[2](#fn_163.md) Only those
that are acquainted with *Brahma* behold Him. He knoweth no direction."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_150"></span>[66:1](m12b028.htm#fr_150.md) The fact is, I do
not know anything of Him, but still I profess to worship him. This is
false behaviour. How shall I be rescued from such falsehood? This is
what Vrihaspati says.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[66:2](m12b028.htm#fr_151.md) The *Chhandas* are
the rules of Prosody as applicable to the Vedic hymns. *Jyotish* is
astronomy. It forms an *Anga* of the Vedas. *Nirukta* furnishes rules
for interpreting obscure passages of the Vedas, and also gives the
meanings of technical or obscure words used therein. *Kalpa* is the
description of religious rites. *Siksha* is the science of Pronunciation
as applied to Vedic hymns and *mantras*.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[67:1](m12b028.htm#fr_152.md) They who believe
that happiness is not eternal and that, therefore, they should not
Pursue it, withdraw themselves from pious acts which lead to that
happiness. They seek Knowledge as the best means for avoiding all that
is transitory and changeful. They seek *moksha* or complete Emancipation
which has been described in the previous sections.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[67:2](m12b028.htm#fr_153.md) The meaning of
'hell' as applied in such passages has been explained before.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[67:3](m12b028.htm#fr_154.md) This is a highly
aphoristic line. I give the sense by expanding the words. By 'acts' here
is meant 'sacrifices and other religious observances.' The intention of
Vrihaspati is to enforce the Propriety of acts, for without acts, the
ends of life cannot, he maintains, be secured.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[67:4](m12b028.htm#fr_155.md) The sense is that
one should devote oneself to acts as a sort of preparation. Afterwards
one should abandon them for obtaining the higher end. Acts, therefore,
have their use, and help one, though mediately, in the acquisition of
*Brahma*.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[67:5](m12b028.htm#fr_156.md) *The mind and acts
have created all things*. This has been explained in the last verse of
section 190 ante. *Both are good paths*, for by both, good end maybe
attained, *viz*., the highest, by drilling the mind, as also (mediately)
by acts (as explained in verse 14 above). The fruits of actions must be
mentally abandoned if the highest end is to be attained; *i.e.*, acts
may be gone through, but their fruits should never be coveted.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[68:1](m12b028.htm#fr_157.md) Nilakantha explains
the grammar of the first line differently. His view is *yatha
chakshurupah praneta nayako*, etc. A better construction would be *yatha
chaksha pranetah* (*bhavati*) etc.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[68:2](m12b028.htm#fr_158.md) This verse may be
said to furnish the key of the doctrine of *karma* or acts and why acts
are to be avoided by persons desirous of *Moksha* or Emancipation. *Acts
have three attributes*: for some are *Sattwika* (good), as sacrifices
undertaken for heaven, etc., some are *Rajasika* (of the quality of
Passion), as penances and rites accomplished from desire of superiority
and victory; and some are *Tamasika* (of the quality of Darkness), as
those undertaken for injuring others, notably the *Atharvan* rites of
*Marana*, *Uchatana*, etc.: this being the case, the *Mantras*, without
acts, cannot be accomplished, are necessarily subject to the same three
attributes. The same is the case with rituals prescribed. It follows,
therefore, that the mind is the chief cause of the kind of fruits won,
*i.e.*, it is the motive that determines the fruits, *viz*., of what
kind it is to be. The enjoyer of the fruit, of course, is the embodied
creature.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[68:3](m12b028.htm#fr_159.md) There can be no
doubt that Nilakantha explains this verse correctly. It is really a
cruce. The words *Naro na samsthanagatah prabhuh syat* must be taken as
unconnected and independent. *Na samsthana gatah* is before death.
*Prabhuh* is *adhikari* (*jnanphale* being understood). K.P. Singha
gives the sense correctly, but the Burdwan translator makes nonsense of
the words.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[68:4](m12b028.htm#fr_160.md) The subject of this
verse as explained by the commentator, is to inculcate the truth that
the result of all acts accomplished by the body is heaven where one in a
physical state (however subtile) enjoys those fruits. If Emancipation is
to be sought, it must be attained through the mind.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[68:5](m12b028.htm#fr_161.md) The sense depends
upon the word *acts*. If *acts* are accomplished by the mind, their
fruits must be enjoyed by the person in a state in which he will have a
mind. Emancipation cannot be achieved by either recitation (japa) or
*Dhyana* (meditation), for both these are *acts*. Perfect liberation
from *acts* is necessary for that great end.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[69:1](m12b028.htm#fr_162.md) *viz*., Taste. etc.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[69:2](m12b028.htm#fr_163.md) *Existent*, line
atom; *non-existent*, line space; *existent-nonexistent*, line Maya or
illusion.
