### SECTION LXXXIX

"Bhishma said, 'Let not such trees as yield edible fruits be cut down in
thy dominions. Fruits and roots constitute the property of the
Brahmanas. The sages have declared this to be an ordinance of religion.
The surplus, after supporting the Brahmanas, should go to the support of
other people. Nobody should take anything by doing an injury to the
Brahmanas. <span id="fr_256"></span>[2](#fn_256.md) If a Brahmana,
afflicted for want of support, desires to abandon a kingdom for
obtaining livelihood (elsewhere), the king, O monarch, should, with
affection and respect, assign unto him the means of sustenance. If he
does not still abstain (from leaving the kingdom), the king should
repair to an assembly of Brahmanas and say, 'Such a Brahmana is leaving
the kingdom. In whom shall my people then find an authority for guiding
them?' <span id="fr_257"></span>[3](#fn_257.md) If after this, he does not
give up his intention of leaving, and says anything, the king should say
unto him, 'Forget the past.' This, O son of Kunti, is the eternal way of
royal duty. <span id="fr_258"></span>[4](#fn_258.md) The king should
further say unto him, 'Indeed, O Brahmana, people say that that only
should be assigned to a Brahmana which would be just sufficient for
maintaining him. I, however, do not accept that opinion. On the other
hand, I think that if a Brahmana seeks to leave a kingdom for the king's
neglect in providing him with means of support, such means should be
assigned to him, and, further, if he intends to take that step for
procuring the means of luxury, he should still be requested to stay and
supplied with ever

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

those means. <span id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_259.md) Agriculture,
cattle-rearing, and trade, provide all men with the means of living. A
knowledge of the Vedas, however, provide them with the means of
obtaining heaven. They, therefore, that obstruct the study of the Vedas
and the cause of Vedic practices, are to be regarded as enemies of
society. <span id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_260.md) It is for the
extermination of these that Brahman created Kshatriyas. Subdue thy foes,
protect thy subjects, worship the deities in sacrifices, and fight
battles with courage, O delighter of the Kurus! A king should protect
those that deserve protection. The king who does this is the best of
rulers. Those kings that do not exercise the duty of protection live a
vain life. For the benefit of all his subjects the king should always
seek to ascertain the acts and thoughts of all, O Yudhishthira; and for
that reason fie should set spies and secret agents. <span
id="fr_261"></span>[3](#fn_261.md) Protecting others from thy own, and thy
own from others, as also others from others, and thy own from thy own,
do thou always cherish thy people. Protecting his own self first from
every one, the king should protect the earth. Men of knowledge have said
that everything has its root in self. The king should always reflect
upon these, *viz*., What are his laches, to what evil habits he is
addicted, what are the sources of his weakness, and what are the sources
of his faults. The king should cause secret and trusted agents to wander
through the kingdom for ascertaining whether his conduct as displayed on
the previous day has or has not met with the approbation of the people.
Indeed, he should ascertain whether his conduct is or is not generally
praised, or, is or is not acceptable to the people of the provinces, and
whether he has or has not succeeded in earning a good name in his
kingdom. Amongst those that are virtuous and possessed of wisdom, those
that never retreat from battle, and those that do not reside in thy
kingdom, those that are dependent on thee, and those that are thy
ministers, as well as those that are independent of party, they that
praise or blame thee should never be objects of disregard with thee, O
Yudhishthira! <span id="fr_262"></span>[4](#fn_262.md) No man, O sire, can
succeed in earning the good opinion of all persons in the world. All
persons have friends, foes, and neutrals, O Bharata!'

"Yudhishthira said, 'Among persons all of whom are equal in might of
arms and accomplishments, whence does one acquire superiority over all
the rest, and whence does that one succeed in ruling over them?'

"Bhishma said, 'Creatures that are mobile devour things that are
immobile; animals again that have teeth devour those that have no teeth;
wrathful snakes of virulent poison devour smaller ones of their own
species. (Upon this principle), among human beings also, the king, who
is strong, preys upon those that are weak. The king, O Yudhishthira,
should always be heedful of his subjects as also of his foes. If he
becomes heedless, they fall upon him like

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

vultures (on carrion). Take care, O king, that the traders in thy
kingdom who purchase articles at prices high and low (for sale), and who
in course of their journeys have to sleep or take rest in forest and
inaccessible regions, <span id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_263.md) be not
afflicted by the imposition of heavy taxes. Let not the agriculturists
in thy kingdom leave it through oppression; they, who bear the burthens
of the king, support the other residents also of the kingdom. <span
id="fr_264"></span>[2](#fn_264.md) The gifts made by thee in this world
support the gods, *Pitris*, men, *Nagas*, *Rakshasas*, birds, and
animals. These, O Bharata, are the means of governing a kingdom and
protecting its rulers. I shall again discourse to thee on the subject, O
son of Pandu!'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_256"></span>[194:2](m12a088.htm#fr_256.md) *i.e.*, before the
Brahmanas get their fill.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[194:3](m12a088.htm#fr_257.md) The Brahmanas are
authorities for guiding other men. When, therefore, a particular
Brahmana leaves the kingdom, the people lose in him a friend, teacher,
and guide.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[194:4](m12a088.htm#fr_258.md) The king should
dissuade in the manner indicated in verse 4. If that does not suffice,
and if the person intending to leave refers to the king's previous
neglect, the king should ask forgiveness and, of course, assign to him
the means of maintenance.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[195:1](m12a088.htm#fr_259.md) The original is
elliptical in construction. The *etat* of the first line has been
supplied in the translation. In rendering the second line, the second
half should come first. The Burdwan version, as usual, is erroneous.
K.P. Singh's also is incomplete and inaccurate.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[195:2](m12a088.htm#fr_260.md) The word used is
*Dasyus*, literally, robbers; here, enemies of society and order.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[195:3](m12a088.htm#fr_261.md) Some texts read
*Yoddhyavyam* for *Boddhyavyam*, and *bhunjita* for *yunjita*.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[195:4](m12a088.htm#fr_262.md) *i.e.*, thou
shouldst care for such opinion, without being angry with those that
censure or blame thee.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[196:1](m12a088.htm#fr_263.md) *i.e.*, they who
have to undergo such privations in carrying on their useful occupation
should not be taxed heavily.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[196:2](m12a088.htm#fr_264.md) The correct reading
is *bharanti*. *Taranti* also may give the same meaning. K. P. Singh has
erroneously rendered the second line.
