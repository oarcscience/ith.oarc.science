### SECTION CXCVII

"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast said that as regards Reciters, they
obtain this very high end. <span id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_127.md) I beg
to enquire whether this is their only end or there is any other to which
they attain.'

"Bhishma said, 'Listen with concentrated attention, O puissant monarch,
to the end that silent Reciters attain, and to the diverse kinds of hell
into which they sink, O bull among men! That Reciter who does not at
first conduct himself according to the method that has been laid down,
and who cannot complete the ritual or course of discipline laid down,
has to go to hell. <span id="fr_128"></span>[2](#fn_128.md) That Reciter
who goes on without faith, who is not contented with his work, and who
takes no pleasure in it, goes to hell, without doubt. They who follow
the ritual with pride in their hearts, all go to hell. That Reciter who
insults and disregards others has to go to hell. That man who betakes
himself to silent recitation under the influence of stupefaction and
from desire of fruit, obtains all those things upon which his heart
becomes set. <span id="fr_129"></span>[3](#fn_129.md) That Reciter whose
heart becomes set upon the attributes that go by the name of divinity,
has to incur hell and never becomes freed from it. <span
id="fr_130"></span>[4](#fn_130.md) That Reciter who betakes himself to
recitation under the influence of attachments (to earthly objects such
as wealth, wives etc.) obtain those objects upon which their hearts are
set. That Reciter of wicked understanding and uncleansed soul who sets
himself to his work with an unstable mind, obtains an unstable end or
goes into hell. That Reciter who is not endued with wisdom and who is
foolish, becomes stupefied or deluded; and in consequence of such
delusion

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

has to go to hell where he is obliged to indulge in regrets. <span
id="fr_131"></span>[1](m12b025.htm#fn_131.md) If a person of even firm
heart, resolving to complete the discipline, betakes himself to
recitation, but fails to attain to completion in consequence of his
having freed himself from attachments by a violent stretch without
genuine conviction of their inutility or harmful character, he also has
to go to hell <span id="fr_132"></span>[2](m12b025.htm#fn_132.md).

"Yudhishthira said, 'When the Reciter attains to the essence of that
which exists in its own nature (without being anything like created or
born objects), which is Supreme, which is indescribable and
inconceivable, and which dwells in the syllable *om* forming the subject
of both recitation and meditation (indeed, when Reciters to a state of
*Brahma*), why is it that they have again to take birth in embodied
forms?'

"Bhishma, said, 'In consequence of the absence of true knowledge and
wisdom, Reciters obtain diverse descriptions of hell. The discipline
followed by Reciters is certainly very superior. These, however, that I
have spoken of, are the faults that appertain to it.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_127"></span>[54:1](m12b024.htm#fr_127.md) The end declared by
Bhishma in the previous section is the success of yoga, or freedom from
decrepitude and death, or death at will, or absorption into Brahma, or
independent, existence in a beatific condition.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[54:2](m12b024.htm#fr_128.md) It should be noted
that 'hell,' as here used, means the opposite of Emancipation. Reciter
may attain to the joys of heaven, but compared to Emancipation, they are
hell, there being the obligation of rebirth attached to them.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[54:3](m12b024.htm#fr_129.md) Even this is a kind
of hell, for there is re-birth attached to it.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[54:4](m12b024.htm#fr_130.md) *Aiswvarya* or the
attributes of godhead are certain extraordinary powers attained by
*yogins* and Reciters. They are the power to become minute or huge in
shape, or go whither soever one will, etc. These are likened to hell,
because of the obligation of re-birth that attaches to them. Nothing
less than Emancipation or the absorption into the Supreme Soul is the
end that should be striven for.
