### SECTION CCCXII

"Yajnavalkya said, Listen to me, O foremost of men, as I tell thee what
the duration of time is in respect to the Unmanifest (or the Supreme
Purusha). Ten thousand Kalpas are said to constitute a single day of
his. The duration of his night is equal. When his night expires, he
awakes, O monarch, and first creates herbs and plants which constitute
the sustenance of all embodied creatures. He then creates Brahman who
springs from a golden egg. That Brahman is the form of all created
things, as has been heard by us. Having dwelt for one whole year within
that egg, the great ascetic Brahman, called also Prajapati (Lord of all
creatures), came out of it and created the whole Earth, and the Heaven
above. The Lord then, it is read in the Vedas, O king, placed the sky
between Heaven and Earth separated from each other. Seven thousand and
five hundred Kalpas measure the day of Brahman. Persons conversant with
the science of Adhyatma say that his night also is of an equal duration.
Brahmana, called Mahan, then creates Consciousness called Bhuta and
endued with excellent essence. <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60.md)
Before creating any physical bodies out of the ingredients called the
Great elements, Mahan or Brahma, endued with penances, created four
others called his sons. They are the sires of the original sires, O Best
of kings, as heard by us. <span id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_61.md) It hath
been also heard by us, O monarch that the senses (of knowledge) along
with the four inner faculties, have sprung from the (five Great elements
called) Pitris, and that the entire universe of mobile and immobile
Beings has been filled with those Great

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

elements. <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md) The puissant Consciousness
created the five Bhutas. These are Earth, Wind, Space, Water, and Light
numbering the fifth. This Consciousness (who is a Great Being and) from
whom springs the third creating, has five thousand Kalpas for his night,
and his day is of equal duration. Sound, Touch, Form, Taste, and
Scent,--these five are called Visesha. They inhere into the five great
Bhutas. All creatures, O king, incessantly pervaded by these five,
desire one another's companionship, become subservient to one another;
and challenging one another, transcend one another; and led by those
immutable and seductive principles, creatures kill one another and
wander in this world entering into numerous orders of Being. <span
id="fr_63"></span>[2](#fn_63.md) Three thousands of Kalpas represent the
duration of their day. The measure of their night also is the
same. <span id="fr_64"></span>[3](#fn_64.md) The Mind roveth over all
things, O king, led on by the Senses. The Senses do not perceive
anything. It is the Mind that perceives through them. The Eye sees forms
when aided by the Mind but never by itself. When the Mind is distracted,
the Eye fails to perceive with even the objects fully before it. It is
commonly said that the Senses perceive. This is not true, for it is the
Mind that perceives through the Senses. When the cessation takes place
of the activity of the Mind, the cessation of the activity of the Senses
follows. That is the cessation of the activity of the Senses which is
the cessation of the activity of the Mind. One should thus regard the
Senses to be under the domination of the Mind. Indeed, the Mind is said
to be the Lord of all the Senses. O thou of great fame, these are all
the twenty Bhutas in the Universe.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_60"></span>[36:1](m12c011.htm#fr_60.md) *Rishi* here means
*Mahan* or Great. Consciousness is said to have an excellent essence,
and is also a *Bhuta* because of its capacity to produce the Great
*Bhutas*, five in number.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[36:2](m12c011.htm#fr_61.md) These, the commentator
explains, are Mind, *Buddhi* or Understanding Consciousness, and
*Chitwa*, considered as *Vyashti* instead of as *Samashthi*. These are
the sires of the primeval sires, *i.e.*, from these sprung the
*Mahabhutas* or Great creatures ([*viz*.](errata.htm#147.md), the five
primal elements).

<span id="fn_62"></span>[37:1](m12c011.htm#fr_62.md) Devah's is explained
by the commentator as meaning the Senses and the four inner faculties.
*Devaih* he thinks, refers to the *Bhutas* or Great elements. Literally
rendered, the verse would read as 'the Devas are the Children of the
Pitris; with the Devas, all the worlds of Mobile Being have been
covered.' It is not safe to reject the learned commentator.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[37:2](m12c011.htm#fr_63.md) These two verses refer
to the power of the attributes of sound etc., over *Jiva*. Loves and
hates, and all kinds of relationship of *Jiva* are due to the action of
the attributes named.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[37:3](m12c011.htm#fr_64.md) The duration here
given has reference to the day and the night of the *Mahabhutas*.
