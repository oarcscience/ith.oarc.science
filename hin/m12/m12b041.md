### SECTION CCXIV

"Bhishma said, 'I shall now tell thee what the means are (for conquering
the senses) as seen with the eye of the scriptures. A person, O king,
will attain to the highest end by the help of such knowledge and by
framing his conduct accordingly. Amongst all living creatures man is
said to be the foremost.

Among men, those that are regenerate have been called the foremost; and
amongst the regenerate, they that are conversant with the Vedas. These
last are regarded as the souls of all living creatures. Indeed, those
Brahmanas

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

that are conversant with the Vedas are regarded as all-seeing and
omniscient. They are persons who have become conversant with Brahma. As
a blind man, without a guide, encounters many difficulties on a road, so
has a person destitute of knowledge to encounter many obstacles in the
world. For this reason, those that are possessed of knowledge are
regarded as superior to the rest. Those that are desirous of acquiring
virtue practise diverse kinds of rites according to the dictates of the
scriptures. They do not, however, succeed in attaining to Emancipation,
all that they gain being those good qualities of which I shall presently
speak. <span id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_248.md) Purity of speech, of body,
and of mind, forgiveness, truth, steadiness, and intelligence,--these
good qualities are displayed by righteous persons observant of both
kinds of religion. That which is called *Brahmacharya* (religion of
abstention or *yoga*) is regarded as the means of attaining to Brahma.
That is the foremost of all religions. It is by the practice of that
religion that one obtains the highest end (*viz*., Emancipation).
*Brahmacharya* is divested of all connection with the five vital
breaths, mind, understanding, the five senses of perception, and the
five senses of action. It is on that account free from all the
perceptions that the senses give. It is heard only as a word, and its
form, without being seen, can only be conceived. It is a state of
existence depending only on the mind. It is free from all connection
with the senses. That sinless state should be attained to by the
understanding alone. He that practises it duly attains to Brahma; he
that practises it half and half, attains to the condition of the gods;
while he that practises it indifferently, takes birth among Brahmanas
and possessed of learning attains to eminence. *Brahmacharya* is
exceedingly difficult to practise. Listen now to the means (by which one
may practise it). That regenerate person who betakes himself to it
should subdue the quality of Passion as soon as it begins to manifest
itself or as soon as it begins to be powerful. One that has betaken
oneself to that vow should not speak with women. He should never cast
his eyes on an undressed woman. The sight of women, under even
indifferent circumstances, fills all weak-minded men with Passion. If a
person (while observing this vow) feels a desire for woman rising in his
heart, he should (as an expiation) observe the vow called *Krichcchra*
and also pass three days in water. <span id="fr_249"></span>[2](#fn_249.md)
If desire is entertained in course of a dream, one should, diving in
water, mentally repeat for three times the three *Riks* by
*Aghamarshana*. <span id="fr_250"></span>[3](#fn_250.md) That wise man who
has betaken himself to the practice of this vow should, with an extended
and enlightened

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

mind, burn the sins in his mind which are all due to the quality of
Passion. As the duct that bears away the refuse of the body is very
closely connected with the body, even so the embodied Soul is very
closely connected with the body that confines it. The different kinds of
juices, passing through the network of arteries, nourish men's wind and
bile and phlegm, blood and skin and flesh, intestines and bones and
marrow, and the whole body. Know that there are ten principal ducts.
These assist the functions of the five senses. From those ten branch out
thousands of other ducts that are minuter in form. Like rivers filling
the ocean at the proper season, all these ducts, containing juices
nourish the body. Leading to the heart there is a duct called
*Manovaha*. It draws from every part of the human body the vital seed
which is born of desire. Numerous other ducts branching out from that
principal one extend into every part of the body and bearing the element
of heat cause the sense of vision (and the rest). As the butter that
lies within milk is churned up by churning rods, even so the desires
that are generated in the mind (by the sight or thought of women) draw
together the vital seed that lies within the body. In the midst of even
our dreams passion having birth in imagination assails the mind, with
the result that the duct already named, *viz*., *Manovaha*, throws out
the vital seed born of desire. The great and divine *Rishi* Atri is
well-conversant with the subject of the generation of the vital seed.
The juices that are yielded by food, the duct called *Manovaha*, and the
desire that is born of imagination,--these three are the causes that
originate the vital seed which has Indra for its presiding deity. The
passion that aids in the emission of this fluid is, therefore, called
*Indriya*. Those persons who know that the course of vital seed is the
cause of (that sinful state of things called) intermixture of castes,
are men of restrained passions. Their sins are regarded to have been
burnt off, and they are never subjected to rebirth. He that betakes
himself to action simply for the purposes of sustaining his body,
reducing with the aid of the mind the (three) attributes (of Goodness,
Passion, and Darkness) into a state of uniformity, and brings at his
last moments the vital breaths to the duct called *Manovaha*, escapes
the obligation of rebirth. <span id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_251.md) The
Mind is sure to gain Knowledge. It is the Mind that takes the form of
all things. The minds of all high-souled persons, attaining to success
through meditation,

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

become freed from desire, eternal, and luminous. <span
id="fr_252"></span>[1](#fn_252.md) Therefore, for destroying the mind (as
mind), one should do only sinless deeds and freeing oneself from the
attributes of Passion and Darkness, one is sure to attain to an end that
is very desirable. <span id="fr_253"></span>[2](#fn_253.md) Knowledge
(ordinarily) acquired in younger days becomes weakened with decrepitude.
A person, however, of ripe understanding succeeds, through the
auspicious effects of past lives, in destroying his desires. <span
id="fr_254"></span>[3](#fn_254.md) Such a person, by transcending the bonds
of the body and the senses like a traveller crossing a path full of
obstacles, and transgressing all faults he sees, succeeds in tasting the
nectar (of Emancipation).'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_248"></span>[100:1](m12b041.htm#fr_248.md) *Arthasamanyam* is
explained by Nilakantha as *Phalasamyam Mokshakhyam niratisayam*. The
Burdwan translator, while using the very words of the commentator,
mistranslates this verse: The speaker desires to show the difference
between the religion of *Pravritti* or acts and that of *Nivritti* or
abstention from acts. Those that follow the former cannot attain to
Emancipation. What they gain are certain good qualities mentioned in the
next verse, which, however, are equally gained by the followers of the
religion of *Nivritti*.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[100:2](m12b041.htm#fr_249.md) The vow of
*Krichcchra* consists of certain fasts. Pass three days in water,
*i.e.*, stand in tank or stream with water up to the chin.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[100:3](m12b041.htm#fr_250.md) The three *Riks*
begin with *Ritancha*, *Satyancha* etc. Every Brahmana who knows his
morning and evening prayers knows these three Riks well.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[101:1](m12b041.htm#fr_251.md) "With the aid of
the mind" means yoga *Dehakarma* means one whose acts are undertaken
only for the purpose of sustaining the body, *i.e.*, one who does no act
that is not strictly necessary for supporting life; hence, as the
commentator explains, one who is free from all propensities leading to
external objects. *Manovaham Pranan nudan*, *i.e.*, bringing to sending
the vital breaths to the duct called *Manovaha* or *Sushumna*. Though a
physical act, its accomplishment becomes possible only by a long course
of penances consisting in the withdrawal of the mind from external
objects. "Reducing the (three) attributes to a state of uniformity," as
explained by the commentator, means arriving at *Nirvikalpa*, *i.e.*, at
that state of knowledge which is independent of the senses.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[102:1](m12b041.htm#fr_252.md) The Knowledge here
spoken of is that knowledge which is independent of the senses. What the
speaker says is that such Knowledge is no myth but is sure to arise.
When it arises, its possessor comes to know that the external world,
etc., is only the mind transformed, like the sights seen and sounds
heard and thoughts cherished in a dream. In the second line the results
of that knowledge are declared. The mind of a Mahatma is
*mantra-siddha*, *i.e.*, has won success by the meditation of the
initial *mantra*, or *om*; it is *nitya*, *i.e.*, eternal, meaning
probably that though the result of *Maya* or *Avidya*, it is no longer
subject to rebirth; it is *virajas*, *i.e.*, free from desire and
passion, and lastly it is *Jyotishmat* or luminous, meaning Omniscient
and Omnipotent. The commentator cites a passage from Vasishtha's
treatise on *yoga* which declares the same results as consequent on the
attainment of Knowledge. It is, of course, implied that in attaining to
such a state, the mind as mind must be destroyed or merged into the Soul
and the Soul, with knowledge only for its attribute, must exist. In the
previous verse emancipation after death has been spoken of. In this
*jivan-mukti* or emancipation in life is referred to.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[102:2](m12b041.htm#fr_253.md) "Freeing oneself
from the attributes of Passion and Darkness", *i.e.*, by practising the
religion of abstention from acts.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[102:3](m12b041.htm#fr_254.md) *Adatte* from *da*
meaning to cut or destroy. *Manasam volam* as explained by the
commentator, is *sankalpam*, *i.e.*, desires or purposes. The man of
ripe understanding, by doing this, attains to that knowledge which is
not subject to decay with age. Hence, such knowledge is superior to
knowledge acquired in the ordinary way.
