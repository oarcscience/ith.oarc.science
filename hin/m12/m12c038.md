### SECTION CCCXXXIX

"Bhishma said, 'Arrived at the spacious realm called White Island, the
illustrious Rishi beheld those same white men possessed of lunar
splendour (of whom I have already spoken to thee). Worshipped by them,
the Rishi worshipped them in return by bending his head and reverencing
them in his mind. <span id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_231.md) Desirous of
beholding Narayana, he began to reside there, attentively engaged in the
silent recitation of *mantras*, sacred to him, and observant of vows of
the most difficult kind, [with](errata.htm#187.md) concentrated mind, the
regenerate Rishi, with arms upraised, stood in Yoga, and then sang the
following hymn unto the Lord of the universe, Him, *viz*., who is at
once the soul of attributes and divested of all attributes.

"Narada said, Salutations to thee, O God of gods, O thou that art freed

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_231"></span>[129:1](m12c038.htm#fr_231.md) The Burdwan
translator, as also K. P. Singha, both err in translating the first line
of this verse. It does not mean that Narada worshipped them with a bend
of his head and that they in return worshipped him mentally.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[129:2](m12c038.htm#fr_232.md) In the sense of His
being unmodified, even as space is an entity that cannot be modified in
any way.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[129:3](m12c038.htm#fr_233.md) *i.e.*, as the
commentator expands, who is displayed without any modification, all else
being modifications of Thyself.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[130:1](m12c038.htm#fr_234.md) *i.e.*, from whom
speech has flowed, or who is Vrihaspati the celestial priest, so famous
for his learning and intelligence.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[130:2](m12c038.htm#fr_235.md) *i.e.*, the
original home of the universe. The idea is that when the universal
dissolution comes, all things take refuge in thee. I follow the
commentator in all the interpretations he gives.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[130:3](m12c038.htm#fr_236.md) *i.e.*, who has
performed the *avabhrita* or final bath upon the completion of all vows
and observances and sacrifices.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[131:1](m12c038.htm#fr_237.md) *i.e.*, thou hast
performed sacrifices.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[131:2](m12c038.htm#fr_238.md) The Vedas have six
limbs or divisions.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[131:3](m12c038.htm#fr_239.md) *Pragjyotish* is
the name of a particular *Saman*. The Rich beginning with *Murdhanam*
etc. when sung, comes to be called by the name of *jeshtha Saman*. What
is said hare, therefore, is that thou art both the foremost of *Samanas*
and he that sings that *Saman*.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[131:4](m12c038.htm#fr_240.md) In the Bombay text,
the reading for *Vainagarbha* is *Vaikhanasa* which means a class or
sect of ascetics.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[132:1](m12c038.htm#fr_241.md) The commentator
explains that by *Mahayajna*--great sacrifice--is meant *Yoga*. The
*Jiva*-Soul is like the libation poured in the sacrifice, for by *Yoga*
the *Jiva*-Soul is annihilated and merged into the Supreme Soul.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[132:2](m12c038.htm#fr_242.md) In treatises on the
*Smriti*, the indications of these three kinds or degrees of
modifications are given.
