### SECTION CCXXXII

"Vyasa said, '*Brahma* is the effulgent seed from which, existing as it
does by itself, hath sprung the whole universe consisting of two kinds
of being, *viz*., the mobile and the immobile. <span
id="fr_377"></span>[1](#fn_377.md) At the dawn of His day, waking up. He
creates with the help of Avidya this universe. At first springs up that
which is called Mahat. That Mahat is speedily transformed into Mind
which is the soul of the Manifest. <span id="fr_378"></span>[2](#fn_378.md)
Overwhelming the Chit, which is effulgent, with Avidya, Mind creates
seven great beings. <span id="fr_379"></span>[3](#fn_379.md) Urged by the
desire of creating, Mind, which is far-reaching, which has many courses,
and which has desire and doubt for its principal indications, begins to
create diverse kinds of objects by modifications of itself. First
springs from it Space. Know that its property is Sound. From Space, by
modification, arises the bearer of all scents, *viz*., the pure and
mighty Wind. It is said to possess the attribute of Touch. From Wind
also, by modification, springs Light endued with effulgence. Displayed
in beauty, and called also Sukram, it starts into existence, thus,
possessing the attribute of Form. From Light, by modification, arises
Water having Taste for its attribute. From Water springs Earth having
Scent for its attribute. These are said to represent initial
creation. <span id="fr_380"></span>[4](#fn_380.md) These, one after
another, acquire the attributes of the immediately preceding ones from
which they have sprung. Each has not only its own special attribute but
each succeeding one has the attributes of all the preceding ones. (Thus
Space has only Sound for its attribute. After Space comes Wind, which
has, therefore, both Sound and Touch for its attributes. From Wind comes
Light or Fire, which has Sound, Touch, and Form for its attributes. From
Light is Water, which has Sound, Touch, Form, and Taste for its
attributes. From Water is Earth, which has Sound, Touch, Form, Taste,
and Scent for its attributes). If anybody, perceiving Scent in Water,
were from ignorance to say that it belongs to Water, he would fall into
an error, for Scent is the attribute of Earth though it may exist in a
state of attachment with Water and also Wind. These seven kinds of
entities, possessing diverse kinds of energy, at first existed
separately from one another. They could not create objects without all
of them coming together into a state of commingling. All these great
entities coming together, and commingling with one another,

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

form the constituent parts of the body which are called limbs. <span
id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_381.md) In consequence of the combination of
those limbs, the sum total, invested with form and having six and ten
constituent parts, becomes what is called the body. (When the gross body
is thus formed), the subtile Mahat, with the unexhausted residue of
acts, then enters that combination called the gross body. <span
id="fr_382"></span>[2](#fn_382.md) Then the original Creator of all beings,
having by his Maya divided Himself, enters that subtile form for
surveying or overlooking everything. And inasmuch as he is the original
Creator of all beings he is on that account called the Lord of all
beings. <span id="fr_383"></span>[3](#fn_383.md) It is he who creates all
beings mobile and immobile. After having thus assumed the form of
Brahman he creates the worlds of the gods, the *Rishis*, the *Pitris*,
and men; the rivers, the seas, and the oceans, the points of the
horizon, countries and provinces, hills and mountains, and large trees,
human beings, *Kinnaras*, *Rakshasas*, birds, animals domestic and wild,
and snakes. Indeed, he creates both kinds of existent things, *viz*.,
those that are mobile and those that are immobile; and those that are
destructible and those that are indestructible. Of these created objects
each obtains those attributes which it had during the previous Creation;
and each, indeed, obtains repeatedly the same attributes at every
subsequent Creation. Determined in respect of character by either
injuriousness or peacefulness, mildness or fierceness, righteousness or
unrighteousness, truthfulness or untruthfulness, each creature, at every
new creation, obtains

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

that particular attribute which it had cherished before. It is in
consequence of this that that particular attribute attaches to it. It is
the Ordainer himself who attaches variety to the great entities (of
Space, Earth, etc.), to the objects of the senses (such as form, etc.),
and to size or bulk of existent matter, and appoints the relations of
creatures with those multiform entities. Amongst men who have devoted
themselves to the science of things, there are some who say that, in the
production of effects, exertion is supreme. Some learned persons say
that Destiny is supreme, and some that it is Nature which is the agent.
Others say that Acts flowing from (personal) exertion, and Destiny,
produce effects, aided by Nature. Instead of regarding any of these as
singly competent for the production of effects, they say that it is the
union of all three that produces all effects. As regards this
subject, <span id="fr_384"></span>[1](#fn_384.md) some say that such is the
case; some, that such is not the case; some, that both of these are not
the case; and some, that it is not that the reverse of both are not.
These, of course, are the contentions of those that depend on Acts, with
reference to objects. They however, whose vision is directed to truth
regard *Brahma* as the cause. <span id="fr_385"></span>[2](#fn_385.md)
Penance is the highest good for living creatures. The roots of penance
are tranquillity and self-restraint. By penance one obtains all things
that one wishes for in one's mind. By penance one attains to that Being
who creates the universe. He who (by penance) succeeds in attaining to
that Being becomes the puissant master of all beings. It is by Penance
that the *Rishis* are enabled to read the Vedas ceaselessly. At the
outset the Self-born caused those excellent Vedic sounds, that are
embodiments of knowledge and that have neither beginning nor end to
(spring up and) flow on (from preceptor to disciple). From those sounds
have sprung all kinds of actions. The names of the *Rishis*, all things
that have been created, the varieties of form seen in existent things,
and the course of actions, have their origin in the Vedas. <span
id="fr_386"></span>[3](#fn_386.md) Indeed, the Supreme Master of all
beings, in the beginning, created all things from the words of the
Vedas. Truly, the names of the *Rishis*, and all else that has been
created, occur in the Vedas. Upon the expiration of his night (*i.e.*,
at the dawn of his day), the uncreate Brahman creates, from prototypes
that existed before, all things which are, of course,

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

well-made by Him. <span id="fr_387"></span>[1](#fn_387.md) In the Vedas
hath been indicated the topic of the Soul's Emancipation, along with the
ten means constituted by study of the Vedas, adoption of the domestic
mode of life, penances, [observance](errata.htm#87.md) of duties common to
all the modes of life, sacrifices, performance of all such acts as lead
to pure fame, meditation which is of three kinds, and that kind of
emancipation which is called success (*Siddhi*) attainable in this
life. <span id="fr_388"></span>[2](#fn_388.md) That incomprehensible Brahma
which has been declared in the words of the Vedas, and which has been
indicated more clearly in the Upanishads by those who have an insight
into the Vedas, can be realised by gradually following the practices
referred to above. <span id="fr_389"></span>[3](#fn_389.md) Unto a person
who thinks he has a body, this consciousness of duality, fraught again
with that of pairs of opposites, is born only of acts in which he is
engaged. (That consciousness of duality ceases during dreamless slumber
or when Emancipation has been attained). That person, however, who has
attained to Emancipation, aided by his knowledge, forcibly drives off
that consciousness of duality. Two Brahmas should be known, *viz*., the
Brahma represented by sound (*i.e.*, the Vedas), and secondly that which
is beyond the Vedas and is supreme. One that is conversant with *Brahma*
represented by sound succeeds in attaining to *Brahma* that is Supreme.
The slaughter of animals is the sacrifice laid down for the Kshatriyas.
The growing of corn is the sacrifice laid down for the Vaisyas. Serving
the three other orders is the sacrifice laid down for the Sudras.
Penances (or worship of *Brahma*) is the sacrifice laid down for the
Brahmanas. In the Krita age the performance of sacrifices was not
necessary. Such performance became necessary in the Treta age. In the
Dwapara, sacrifices have begun to fall off. In the Kali, the same is the
case with them. In Krita age, men, worshipping only one Brahma, looked
upon the *Richs*, the *Samans*, the *Yajuses* and the rites and
sacrifices that are performed from motives of advantage, as all
different from the object of their worship, and practised only *Yoga*,
by means of penances. In the Treta age, many mighty men appeared that
swayed all mobile and immobile objects. (Though the generality of men in
that age were not naturally inclined to the practice of righteousness,
yet those great

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

leaders forced them to such practice.) Accordingly, in that age, the
Vedas, and sacrifices and the distinctions between the several orders,
and the four modes of life, existed in a compact state. In consequence,
however, of the decrease in the period of life in Dwapara, all these, in
that age, fall off from that compact condition. In the Kali age, all the
Vedas become so scarce that they may not be even seen by men. Afflicted
by iniquity, they suffer extermination along with the rites and
sacrifices laid down in them. The righteousness which is seen in the
Krita age is now visible in such Brahmanas as are of cleansed souls and
as are devoted to penances and the study of the scriptures. As regards
the other *yugas*, it is seen that without at once giving up the duties
and acts that are consistent with righteousness, men, observant of the
practices of their respective orders, and conversant with the ordinance
of the Vedas are led by the authority of the scriptures, to betake
themselves from motives of advantage and interest to sacrifices and vows
and pilgrimages to sacred waters and spots. <span
id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_390.md) As in the season of rains a large
variety of new objects of the immobile order are caused to come forth
into life by the showers that fall from the clouds, even so many new
kinds of duty or religious observances are brought about in each *yuga*.
As the same phenomena reappear with the reappearance of the seasons,
even so, at each new Creation the same attributes appear in each new
Brahman and Hara. I have, before this, spoken to thee of Time which is
without beginning and without end, and which ordains this variety in the
universe. It is that Time which creates and swallows up all creatures.
All the innumerable creatures that exist subject to pairs of opposites
and according to their respective natures, have Time for their refuge.
It is Time that assumes those shapes and it is Time that upholds
them. <span id="fr_391"></span>[2](#fn_391.md) I have thus discoursed to
thee, O son, on the topics about which thou hadst inquired, *viz*.,
Creation, Time, Sacrifices and other rites, the Vedas, the real actor in
the universe, action, and the consequences of action.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_377"></span>[157:1](m12b059.htm#fr_377.md) *Tejomayam* is
explained by the commentator as *Vasanamayam* or having the principle of
desire or wish within it, otherwise Creation could not take place.
*Yasya* is used for *yatah*.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[157:2](m12b059.htm#fr_378.md) By Mahat is meant
Pure or Subtile Intelligence. The Manifest starts into existence from
Mind or has Mind for its soul. Hence, as explained in previous Sections,
Mind is called *Vyaktatmakam*.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[157:3](m12b059.htm#fr_379.md) These seven great
Beings or entities are *Mahat*, the same speedily transformed into Mind,
and the five elemental entities of Space, etc.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[157:4](m12b059.htm#fr_380.md) Verses 4, 5, 6 and
7 occur in *Manusmriti*, corresponding with the latter's 75, 76, 77 and
78 of Chapter 1.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[158:1](m12b059.htm#fr_381.md) *Chit* or *Jiva* is
called *Purusha* or resider in body, because when overlaid with Avidya
by the Supreme Soul, it is not possible for it to exist in any other way
than by being invested with a covering or case made of primordial matter
determined by the power of acts. Here, however, it means limbs or
*avayavam*.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[158:2](m12b059.htm#fr_382.md) What is stated in
verse 10, 11 and 12 is this: the seven great entities, in their gross
form, are unable, if separate, to produce anything. They, therefore,
combine with one another. Thus uniting, they first form the *asrayanam*
of sarira *i.e.*, the constituent parts of the body. They, at this
stage, must be known by the name of *Purusha* of *avayava*, *i.e.*, mere
limbs. When these limbs again unite, then *murtimat shodasatmakam
sartram bhavati*, *i.e.*, the full body, possessed of form and having
the six and ten attributes, comes into existence. Then the subtile
*Mahat* and the subtile *bhutas*, with the unexhausted residue of acts,
enter it. The plural form '*mahanti*' is used because, as the
commentator explains, '*pratipurusham mahatadinam
bhinnatwapratipadanertham*,' *i.e.*, the same '*mahat*,' by entering
each different form apparently becomes many. Thus there are two bodies,
one gross, and the other subtile called '*linga-sarira*.' The residue of
acts is thus explained: all creatures enjoy or suffer the effects of
their good and bad acts. If, however, the consequences of acts, good and
bad, be all exhausted, there can be no rebirth. A residue, therefore,
remains in consequence of which rebirth becomes possible. Creation and
destruction, again, are endlessly going on. The beginning of the *first*
Creation is inconceivable. The Creation here described is one of a
series. This is further explained in the verses that follow.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[158:3](m12b059.htm#fr_383.md) The six and ten
parts are the five gross *bhutas*, and the eleven senses of knowledge
and action including mind. The great creatures are the *tan-mantras* of
the gross elements, *i.e.*, their subtile forms. At first the gross body
(with the principle of growth) is formed, into it enters the subtile
body or the *linga-sarira*. At first (as already said) the gross
elements come together. Then the subtile ones with the residue of acts.
Then enters the Soul which is *Brahma* itself. The Soul enters into the
subtile form for witnessing, or surveying. All creatures are only
manifestations of that Soul due to the accident of *Avidya* or *Maya*.
*Tapas* means, as the commentator explains, *alochana*.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[159:1](m12b059.htm#fr_384.md) *i.e.*, this
variety of Being and this variety of relations.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[159:2](m12b059.htm#fr_385.md) *Anubhe* is
explained as *ubhayavyatiriktam*. *Sattwasthas* are those that depend
upon the really existent, *i.e.*, those that regard *Brahma* as the sole
cause competent for the production of all effects.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[159:3](m12b059.htm#fr_386.md) It is exceedingly
difficult to understand the true meaning of these verses. A verbal
translation is not calculated to bring out the sense. Apparently, the
statement that all things are contained in the Vedas is nonsense. In
reality, however, what is intended to be said is that as the Vedas are
Speech or Words, the Creator had to utter words symbolizing his ideas
before creating anything. It is remarkable that there is a close
resemblance between the spirit of the first chapter of Genesis with what
is contained in the *Srutis* on the subject of Creation. Let there be
Earth, and there was Earth, says the inspired poet of Genesis.
Nilakantha cites exactly similar words from the *Srutis* as those which
Brahman uttered for creating the Earth, such as, *Bhuriti vyaharau* as
*Bhumimasrijat*. Then the four modes of life with the duties of each,
the modes of worship, etc., were also indicated, hence, all acts also
are in the Vedas which represent the words of *Brahma*.

<span id="fn_387"></span>[160:1](m12b059.htm#fr_387.md) All things are
*Sujata* or well-made by him. In Genesis it is said that God uttered
particular words and particular objects sprang into existence, and He
saw that they were good.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[160:2](m12b059.htm#fr_388.md) The first line
contains only technical terms. *Nama* means *Rigveda*. Hence, it stands
for study of all the Vedas. *Bheda* stands for half, *i.e.*, for the
wife, who must be associated with her husband in all religious acts.
*Tapah* is penance; hence it stands for all kinds of observances like
*chandrayana*, and modes of life, *vanaprastha*, etc. *Karma* means such
acts as the saying of morning and evening prayers, etc. *Yama* is
sacrifice like *jyotishtoma* etc. *Akhya* means such acts as lead to
good fame, like the digging of tanks, the making of roads, etc. *Aloka*,
meaning meditation, is of three kinds. Lastly, comes *Siddhi*, meaning
that emancipation which is arrived at by one during this life. The
instrumental plural *kramaih* should be construed as *dasabhih karmaih
namadibhi sahita Vedeshu prechate*. K.P. Singha has correctly rendered
the verse, omitting reference to *Siddhi*. The Burdwan translator has
totally misunderstood it.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[160:3](m12b059.htm#fr_389.md) *Gahanam* is
explained by the commentator as *duravagaham Brahma*; *vedavadeshu*
means, according to him, the rites and observances laid down in the
Vedas. It is better, however, to take it literally, *i.e.*, for the
words of the Vedas. Vedanteshu means 'in the Upanishads,' which come
*after* the Vedas, Both the Vernacular translators have misunderstood
this verse.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[161:1](m12b059.htm#fr_390.md) This verse is, no
doubt, pleonastic. The commentator interprets it in the way I have
rendered it. *Yathadharmam*, according to him, means 'without
transgressing acts and duties consistent with virtue'; *yathagamam*
means 'following the authority of the scriptures'; *vikriyate* implies
'do from motives of advantage and gain.' The sense seems to be that in
the three other *yugas*, men, without absolutely abandoning virtue,
perform good acts and Vedic sacrifices and rites and scriptural vows and
observances, from motives of low gain and not as a Preparation for
Emancipation. Thus even in the Kali age, Vedic rites are not absolutely
unknown. The motive, however, from which these are undertaken is
connected with some low or sordid gain.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[161:2](m12b059.htm#fr_391.md) *Samayah sthanam
matam; sa eva bhutani bhavati; sa eva tan dadhati*. This is the
construction, as explained by the commentator.
