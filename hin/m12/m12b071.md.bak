### SECTION CCXLIV

"Bhishma said, "Though hast been told what the duties of domesticity are
as ordained by the wise. Listen now, O Yudhishthira, to what those
duties are that have been next spoken of. Gradually abandoning the
domestic mode, one should enter the third mode which is excellent. It is
the mode in which wives afflict themselves by means of Austerities. It
is the mode practised by those that live as forest recluses. Blessed be
thou, O son, listen to the duties observed by those that lead this mode
of life in which occur the practices of all men and all modes of life.
Listen, indeed, to the duties of those that are denizens of sacred spots
and that have resorted to this mode after proper
[deliberation](errata.htm#101.md)!'

"Vyasa said, 'When the householder beholds wrinkles on his body and
white hair on his head, and children of his children, he should then
retire into the forest. The third part of his life he should pass in the
observance of the

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *Vanaprastha* mode. He should attend to those
fires to which he had attended as a householder. Desirous of
sacrificing, he should adore the deities (according to the rituals
ordained). Observant of vows and abstemious in diet, he should eat only
once, the time thereof being the sixth part of the day. He should be
always heedful. Attending to his fires, he should keep some kine,
waiting upon them dutifully. <span id="fr_505"></span>[1](#fn_505.md) He
should attend to all the rituals of a sacrifice. He should live upon
rice growing indigenously, upon wheat growing under similar
circumstances, upon grain of other kinds, growing wildly (and belonging
to none). He should eat what remains after feeding guests. In this the
third mode of life, he should present offerings of clarified butter in
the five well-known Sacrifices. <span id="fr_506"></span>[2](#fn_506.md)
Four kinds of courses of conduct have been laid down for observance in
the Vanaprastha mode of life. Some collect only what is needed for the
day. Some collect stores to last for a month. Some store grain and other
necessaries sufficient to last for twelve years. Forest recluses may act
in these ways for worshipping guests and performing sacrifices. They
should during the season of the rains, expose themselves to rain and
betake themselves to water during the autumn. During the summer they
should sit in the midst of four fires with the sun burning overhead.
Throughout the year, however, they should be abstemious in diet. <span
id="fr_507"></span>[3](#fn_507.md) They sit and sleep on the bare earth.
They stand on only their toes. They content themselves with the bare
earth and with small mats of grass (owning no other furniture for seat
or bed). They perform their ablutions morning, noon, and evening
(preparatory to sacrifices). Some amongst them use only teeth for
cleaning grain. Others use only stones for that purpose. <span
id="fr_508"></span>[4](#fn_508.md) Some amongst them drink, only during the
lighted fortnight, the gruel of wheat (or other grain) boiled very
lightly. <span id="fr_509"></span>[5](#fn_509.md) There are many who drink
similar gruel only during the dark fortnight. Some eat what only comes
by the way (without seeking to obtain it). Some adopting rigid vows,
live upon only roots, some upon only fruits, some upon only flowers,
duly observing the method followed by the Vaikhanasas. These and other
diverse observances are adopted by those men of wisdom and piety. The
fourth is (the mode called Renunciation) based upon the Upanishads. The
duties laid down for it may be observed in all the modes of life
equally. This mode differing from the others comes *after* domesticity
and forest life. In this very Yuga, O son,

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

many learned Brahmanas conversant with the truths of all things, have
been known to observe this mode. Agastya, the seven *Rishis* (*viz*.,
Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Vasishtha, Narada, and Kratu),
Madhucchandas, Aghamarshana, Sankriti Sudivatandi who lived withersoever
he pleased and was content to take what came (without ever seeking for
anything). <span id="fr_510"></span>[1](#fn_510.md) Ahovirya Kavya, Tandya,
the learned Medhatithi, Karmanirvaka of mighty energy, and Sunyapala who
had exerted himself greatly (for acquiring ascetic puissance) were the
authors of this course of duties, and themselves observing them have all
proceeded to heaven. Many great *Rishis*, O son, who had the puissance
to behold immediately the fruits of their ascetic merit, <span
id="fr_511"></span>[2](#fn_511.md) those numerous ascetics who are known by
the name of Yayavaras, many *Rishis* of very austere penances and
possessed of accurate knowledge in respect of distinctions of duty, and
many other Brahmanas too numerous to mention, adopted the forest mode of
life. The Vaikhanasas, the Valikhilyas, the Saikatas, all of whom were
devoted to austere penances, <span id="fr_512"></span>[3](#fn_512.md) who
were steadfast in virtue, who had subdued their senses, and who used to
behold the fruits of their penances immediately, adopted this mode of
life and finally ascended to heaven. Freed from fear and not counted
among the stars and planets, these have become visible in the firmament
as luminous bodies. <span id="fr_513"></span>[4](#fn_513.md) When the
fourth or last part of life is reached, and when one is weakened by
decrepitude and afflicted by disease, one should abandon the forest mode
of life (for the fourth mode called Renunciation). Performing a
sacrifice that is capable of being completed in a single day and in
which the *Dakshina* should be everything of which he may be possessed,
he should himself perform his own *Sraddha*. Withdrawn from every other
object, he should devote himself to his own self, taking pleasure in
himself, and resting also on his own self. <span
id="fr_514"></span>[5](#fn_514.md) He should establish all his sacrificial
fires (thenceforth) upon his own self, and give up all kinds of ties and
attachments. (In case he fails to attain to complete Renunciation) he
should always perform such sacrifices and rites as are completed in a
single day. <span id="fr_515"></span>[6](#fn_515.md) When, however, from
performance of the (ordinary) sacrifices of sacrificers, the Sacrifice
in Self proceeds, then (may he discontinue all ordinary sacrifices, and)
unto the three fires duly sacrifice in

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

his own Self for the sake of his Emancipation. <span
id="fr_516"></span>[1](#fn_516.md) Without finding fault with his food he
should eat five or six mouthfuls, offering them duly unto five vital
airs uttering (every time the well-known) *mantras* of the
Yajurveda. <span id="fr_517"></span>[2](#fn_517.md) Engaged in the
observance of austerities while leading the life of a forest recluse,
one should shave off one's hair and bristles and pare off one's nails,
and having cleansed oneself by acts, pass into the fourth and last mode
of life that is fraught with great holiness. <span
id="fr_518"></span>[3](#fn_518.md) That regenerate person who enters the
fourth mode of life, giving pledges of assurance unto all creatures,
succeeds in earning many regions of blazing effulgence hereafter and
ultimately attains to the Infinite. <span
id="fr_519"></span>[4](#fn_519.md) Of excellent disposition and conduct,
with sins all washed off, the person who is conversant with his own self
never desires to do any act for either this or the other world. Freed
from wrath and from error, without anxiety and without friendship, such
a person lives in this world like one totally uninterested in its
concerns. One (in the observance of Sannyasa) should not feel reluctant
in discharging the duties included in *Yama* and those also that walk
behind them (and are included in *niyama*). Such a one should with
energy live according to the ordinances in respect of his own mode, and
throw away Vedic study and the sacred thread that is indicative of the
order of his birth. Devoted to righteousness and with his senses under
complete control, such a one, possessed of knowledge of self, attains
undoubtedly to the end for which he strives. <span
id="fr_520"></span>[5](#fn_520.md) After the third is the fourth

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

mode of life. It is very superior, and fraught with numerous high
virtues. It transcends in point of merit the three other modes of life.
It is said to occupy the highest place. Listen to me as I discourse upon
the duties that belong to that mode which is pre-eminent and which is
the high refuge of all!'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_505"></span>[193:1](m12b071.htm#fr_505.md) The cow is a sacred
animal and there is merit in feeding and properly tending a cow. Forest
recluses kept kine for merit as also for *homa* or sacrifice with the
ghee obtained from them. The story of Vasishtha's cow is well-known.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[193:2](m12b071.htm#fr_506.md) These five are
*Agnihotra*, *Darsapurnamasi*, *Chaturmasya*, *Pasu* sacrifice and
*Soma* sacrifice.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[193:3](m12b071.htm#fr_507.md) The Burdwan
translator misunderstands the words *abhravakasah*. It is a well-known
word [occurring](errata.htm#102.md) in almost every lexicon. Wilson
explains it correctly.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[193:4](m12b071.htm#fr_508.md) *i.e.*, They do not
use a regular husking or cleaning apparatus for cleaning the grain they
use as food.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[193:5](m12b071.htm#fr_509.md) So that very small
portion of the grain comes out for drink or mixes with the water.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[194:1](m12b071.htm#fr_510.md) *i.e.*, who had no
fixed residence and who never sought with any effort for the necessaries
of life. The Burdwan translator takes both *yathavasah* and
*akritacramah* for two independent names of *Rishis* instead of taking
them as adjectives of *Sudivatandi*.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[194:2](m12b071.htm#fr_511.md) *i.e.*, whose
wishes were immediately crowned with success, in respect of both
blessings and curses, etc.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[194:3](m12b071.htm#fr_512.md) *Niranandah* is
explained as *krichcchrachandrayanadiparatwat*.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[194:4](m12b071.htm#fr_513.md) *Anakstrah* is
explained by the commentator as 'different from stars and planets but
still freed from darkness' and, therefore, effulgent or luminous.
*Anadhrishyah* is fearless.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[194:5](m12b071.htm#fr_514.md) *Atmayaji* is
explained as one who performs his own *sraddha* or obsequial rites. The
Sandhi in the next word is *arsha*; *atmakrida* is one who does not take
pleasure in wife or children but whose source of pleasure is his own
self: Similarly, *atmasraya* is one who without depending upon kings or
others takes refuge in himself.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[194:6](m12b071.htm#fr_515.md) Such sacrifice, for
example, as those called *Brahma-yajna*, etc.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[195:1](m12b071.htm#fr_516.md) *Yajinam yajna* is
the sacrifice of ordinary sacrifices, *i.e.*, the usual sacrifices
consisting of tangible offerings unto the deities, and performed with
the aid of Vedic *mantras*. The ablative implies cause. *Atmani ijya* is
sacrifice in Self, *i.e.*, *Yoga*. The meaning of the first line,
therefore, is when through performance of ordinary sacrifices and rites,
the mind becomes pure and the sacrificer is enabled to practise yoga.
Unto the three fires he should duly sacrifice on his own self. means, of
course, that without any longer adoring his fires by visible rites and
actual recitation of *mantras*, he should, for the sake of emancipation,
worship in his own self or seek the extinction of mind and knowledge in
*Yoga*.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[195:2](m12b071.htm#fr_517.md) To this day every
orthodox Brahmana or [Kshatriya](errata.htm#103.md) or Vaisya never eats
without offering at the outset five small mouthfuls unto the five vital
breaths, *i.e.*, *Prana*, *Apana*, *Samana*, *Udana*, and *Vyana*.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[195:3](m12b071.htm#fr_518.md) *Vapya* or
*Vapayitwa* means causing or obtaining a shave. The Burdwan translator
makes a blunder by supposing it to mean *parivyapta*. The Sannyasa mode
of life, as well-known, can never be entered without a previous shave.
K.P. Singha gives the correct version.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[195:4](m12b071.htm#fr_519.md) It is difficult to
render the word *abhaya* into English. 'To give *abhaya* to all
creatures' is to pledge oneself to a life of total harmlessness, or to
practise universal compassion or benevolence. Abstention from every kind
of injury is the great duty of the fourth mode of life.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[195:5](m12b071.htm#fr_520.md) The duties included
in *yama* (as explained by the commentator) are universal benevolence,
truthfulness, faith, Brahmacharya, and freedom from attachment. Those
that are included in *niyama* are purity (of body and mind),
contentment, study of the Vedas, meditation on the Supreme, etc.
*Swasastra sutra* means the sutras of his own *sastras*--*i.e.*, the
duties laid down in respect of that Sannyasa which he has adopted; the
chief of which is enquiry after the Soul or Self: *Bhutimanta* implies
Vedic recitation and the sacred thread. He who has taken to Sannyasa
should display energy in these, *i.e.*, persistently enquire after the
Soul and throw away all caste-marks, and other indications. 'The
desirable end' is of course, gradual Emancipation of that obtained at
once. Following the commentator, K.P. Singha gives the correct version.
The Burdwan version, containing the very words of the gloss, is based
upon a complete misconception of their meaning.
