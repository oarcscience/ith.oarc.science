### SECTION CCLXXXIX

"Yudhishthira said, 'How, O grandsire, should a king like us behave in
this world, keeping in view the great object of acquisition? What
attributes, again, should he always possess so that he may be freed from
attachments?'

"Bhishma said, 'I shall in this connection recite to thee the old
narrative that was uttered by Arishtanemi unto Sagara who had sought his
counsel.'

"Sagara said, 'What is that good, O Brahmana, by doing which one may

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

enjoy felicity here? How, indeed, may one avoid grief and agitation? I
wish to know all this!'

"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by Sagara, Arishtanemi of Tarkshya's
race, conversant with all the scriptures, regarding the questioner to be
every way deserving of his instructions, said these words, <span
id="fr_980"></span>[1](#fn_980.md) 'The felicity of Emancipation is true
felicity in the world. The man of ignorance knows it not, attached as he
is to children and animals and possessed of wealth and corn. An
understanding that is attached to worldly objects and a mind suffering
from thirst,--these two baffle all skilful treatment. The ignorant man
who is bound in the chains of affection is incapable of acquiring
Emancipation. <span id="fr_981"></span>[2](#fn_981.md) I shall presently
speak to thee of all the bonds that spring from the affections. Hear
them with attention. Indeed, they are capable of being heard with profit
by one that is possessed of knowledge. Having procreated children in due
time and married them when they become young men, and having ascertained
them to be competent for earning their livelihood, do thou free thyself
from all attachments and rove about in happiness. When thou seest thy
dearly-cherished wife grown old in years and attached to the son she has
brought forth, do thou leave her in time, keeping in view the highest
object of acquisition (*viz*., Emancipation). Whether thou obtainest a
son or not, having during the first years of thy life duly enjoyed with
thy senses the objects that are addressed to them, free thyself from
attachments and rove about in happiness. Having indulged the senses with
their objects, thou shouldst suppress the desire of further indulging
them. Freeing thyself then from attachments, thou shouldst rove in
felicity, contenting thyself with what is obtained without effort and
previous calculation, and casting an equal eye upon all creatures and
objects. <span id="fr_982"></span>[3](#fn_982.md) Thus, O son, have I told
thee in brief (of what the way is for freeing thyself from attachments).
Hear me now, for I shall presently tell thee, in detail, the
desirability of the acquisition of Emancipation. <span
id="fr_983"></span>[4](#fn_983.md) Those persons who live in this world
freed from attachments and fear, succeed in obtaining happiness. Those
persons, however, who are attached to worldly objects, without doubt,
meet with destruction. Worms and ants (like men) are engaged in the
acquisition of food and are seen to die in the search. They that are
freed from attachments are happy, while they that are attached to
worldly objects meet with destruction. If thou desirest to attain to
Emancipation thou shouldst never bestow thy thoughts on thy relatives,
thinking,--How shall these exist without me?--A living creature takes
birth by himself, and grows by himself, and obtains happiness and
misery, and death by himself. In this world people enjoy and obtain food
and raiment and other acquisitions earned by their parents or
themselves. This is the result of the acts of past lives, for

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

nothing can be had in this life which is not the result of the past. All
creatures live on the Earth, protected by their own acts, and obtaining
their food as the result of what is ordained by Him who assigns the
fruits of acts. A man is but a lump of clay, and is always himself
completely dependent on other forces. One, therefore, being oneself so,
in firm, what rational consideration can one have for protecting and
feeding one's relatives? When thy relatives are carried away by Death in
thy very sight and in spite of even thy utmost efforts to save them,
that circumstance alone should awaken thee. In the every lifetime of thy
relatives and before thy own duty is completed of feeding and protecting
them, thyself mayst meet with death and abandon them. After thy
relatives have been carried away from this world by death, thou canst
not know what becomes of them there,--that is, whether they meet with
happiness or misery. This circumstance ought to awaken thee. When in
consequence of the fruits of their own acts thy relatives succeed in
maintaining themselves in this world whether thou livest or diest,
reflecting on this thou shouldst do what is for thy own good. <span
id="fr_984"></span>[1](#fn_984.md) When this is known to be the case, who
in the world is to be regarded as whose? Do thou, therefore, set thy
heart on the attainment of Emancipation. Listen now to what more I shall
say unto thee. That man of firm Soul is certainly emancipated who has
conquered hunger and thirst and such other states of the body, as also
wrath and cupidity and error. That man is always emancipated who does
not forget himself, through folly, by indulging in gambling and drinking
and concubinage and the chase. That man who is really touched by sorrow
in consequence of the necessity there is of eating every day and every
night for supporting life, is said to be cognisant of the faults of
life. One who, as the result of careful reflection, regards his repeated
births to be only due to sexual congress with women, is held to be freed
from attachments. That man is certainly emancipated who knows truly the
nature of the birth, the destruction, and the exertion (or acts) of
living creatures. That man becomes certainly freed who regards (as
worthy of his acceptance) only a handful of corn, for the support of
life, from amidst millions upon millions of carts loaded with grain, and
who disregards the difference between a shed of bamboo and reeds and a
palatial mansion. <span id="fr_985"></span>[2](#fn_985.md) That man becomes
certainly freed who beholds the

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

world to be afflicted by death and disease and famine. <span
id="fr_986"></span>[1](#fn_986.md) Indeed, one who beholds the world to be
such succeeds in becoming contented; while one who fails to behold the
world in such a light, meets with destruction. That man who is contented
with only a little is regarded as freed. That man who beholds the world
as consisting of eaters and edibles (and himself as different from both)
and who is never touched by pleasure and pain which are born of
illusion, is regarded as emancipate. That man who regards a soft bed on
a fine bedstead and the hard soil as equal, and who regards good *sali*
rice and hard thick rice as equal, is emancipated. That man who regards
linen and cloth made of grass as equal, and in whose estimation cloth of
silk and barks of trees are the same, and who sees no difference between
clean sheep-skin and unclean leather, is emancipated That man who looks
upon this world as the result of the combination of the five primal
essences, and who behaves himself in this world, keeping this notion
foremost, is emancipated. That man who regards pleasure and pain as
equal, and gain and loss as on a par, in whose estimation victory and
defeat differ not, to whom like and dislike are the same, and who is
unchanged under fear and anxiety, is wholly emancipated. That man who
regards his body which has so many imperfections to be only a mass of
blood, urine and excreta, as also of disorders and diseases, is
emancipated. That man becomes emancipated who always recollects that
this body, when overtaken by decrepitude, becomes assailed by wrinkles
and white hairs and leanness and paleness of complexion and a bending of
the form. That man who recollects his body to be liable to loss of
virility, and weakness of sight, and deafness, and loss of strength, is
emancipated. That man who knows that the very Rishis, the deities, and
the Asuras are beings that have to depart from their respective spheres
to other regions, is emancipated. That man who knows that thousands of
kings possessed of even great offence and power have departed from this
earth, succeeds in becoming emancipated. That man who knows that in this
world the acquisition of objects is always difficult, that pain is
abundant, and that the maintenance of relatives is ever attended with
pain, becomes emancipated. <span id="fr_987"></span>[2](#fn_987.md)
Beholding the abundant faults of children and of other men, who is there
that would not adore Emancipation? That man who, awakened by the
scriptures and the experience of the world, beholds every human concern
in this world to be unsubstantial, becomes emancipated. Bearing in mind
those words of mine, do thou conduct thyself like one that has become
emancipated, whether it is a life of domesticity that thou wouldst lead
or pursue emancipation without suffering thy understanding to be
confounded.' <span id="fr_988"></span>[3](#fn_988.md) Hearing these words
of his

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

with attention, Sagara, that lord of earth, acquired those virtues which
are productive of Emancipation and continued, with their aid to rule his
subjects.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_976"></span>[339:1](m12b115.htm#fr_976.md) *Kamesah* is
possessor of all objects of desire or enjoyment. The sense is this:
where the king, casting off desire, wins prosperity for himself; *i.e.*,
though possessed of wealth, is not attached to wealth. The expression
may also mean 'master of desire,' *i.e.*, where the king casts off
desire and masters his desires without allowing the latter to master
him.

<span id="fn_977"></span>[339:2](m12b115.htm#fr_977.md) *Pratyupasthite* is
*pritipatwena upasthite*, *i.e.*, *hiyantanesati*.

<span id="fn_978"></span>[339:3](m12b115.htm#fr_978.md) I am not sure that
I have understood aright the second line of this verse. It may also
mean, 'No one is able to enumerate all that is beneficial for the Soul
in consequence of the wideness of subject.

<span id="fn_979"></span>[339:4](m12b115.htm#fr_979.md) *Vrittam* has
*uddisya* understood after it. The Bombay text reads *pranihitatmanah*;
the Bengal reading is *pranihitatmanah*. If the Bengal reading be
accepted, it would mean 'whose soul is fixed or established on *Yoga*.'
*Tapasa* is explained by the commentator as *swadharmena*, in view of
the question of Galava which Narada answers. The sense, however, would
remain unaltered if it be taken as standing for Self-control or
penances.

<span id="fn_980"></span>[340:1](m12b116.htm#fr_980.md) *Sampadam* is
explained by the commentator as *upadesa-yogyata-sriyam*.

<span id="fn_981"></span>[340:2](m12b116.htm#fr_981.md) Some texts read
*sakyam*; the reading *sakyah* also occurs. If the former be accepted,
it must be taken as referring to *tadawayam* as the commentator
explains. No alteration in sense occurs by adhering to the one reading
or the other.

<span id="fn_982"></span>[340:3](m12b116.htm#fr_982.md) In the second line
some of the Bengal texts read *lobheshu*. The correct reading is
*lokeshu*. Both the vernacular translators adhere to the wrong reading.

<span id="fn_983"></span>[340:4](m12b116.htm#fr_983.md) *Mokshartha* is
*moksha-prayojanah*.

<span id="fn_984"></span>[341:1](m12b116.htm#fr_984.md) The argument
contained in these verses is this: as thou dost not know what becomes of
thy relatives when they die, thou canst not help them then. It seems
plain, therefore, that when thou shalt die thy relatives will not be
able to do thee any good. Hence, thou gainest nothing by bestowing thy
thoughts on thy relatives, forgetting thy own great concern, *viz*., the
acquisition of Emancipation. Similarly, when thy relatives live and
suffer irrespective of thy life or death, and thou too must enjoy or
endure irrespective of their existence or efforts, it is meant that thou
shouldst not be forgetful of thy own highest good by busying thyself
with the concerns of thy relatives.

<span id="fn_985"></span>[341:2](m12b116.htm#fr_985.md) The sense is that
one who takes only a handful of corn for the support of life even when
millions upon millions of carts loaded with corn await his acceptance,
is certainly to be regarded as freed. Literally rendered, the second
line is--'who beholds a shed of bamboo or reeds in a palace,' meaning,
of course, as put above, 'one who sees no difference between the two.'

<span id="fn_986"></span>[342:1](m12b116.htm#fr_986.md) *Avritti* is want
of the means of sustaining life: thence, scarcity or famine.

<span id="fn_987"></span>[342:2](m12b116.htm#fr_987.md) The sense is that
as the maintenance of wives and children is painful, one should withdraw
from the world and retire into solitude.

<span id="fn_988"></span>[342:3](m12b116.htm#fr_988.md) The sense seems to
be this: Is it a life of domesticity that thou wouldst lead? There is no
harm in thy doing this, provided thou behavest in the way pointed out.
Is it Emancipation that thou wouldst pursue (in the usual way), *i.e.*,
by retiring into solitude and betaking thyself to *Sannyasa*? Thou mayst
then behave in the way pointed out, and, indeed, that is the way of
Sannyasa which leads to Emancipation.
