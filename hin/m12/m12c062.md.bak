### SECTION CCCLXIII

"Surya said, 'This Being is not the god of fire, he is not an Asura. Nor
is he a Naga. He is a Brahmana who has attained to heaven in consequence
of his having been crowned with success in the observance of the vow
called Unccha. <span id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_356.md) This person had

had sometimes subsisted upon water, and sometimes upon air alone,
passing his days with concentrated

soul. The deity Mahadeva had been gratified by him with constant
recitation of the Samhitas. He had endeavoured to accomplish those acts
that lead to heaven. Through the merits of those acts he hath now
attained to heaven. Without wealth and without desire of any kind, he
had observed the vow called Unccha in the matter of his sustenance. This
learned Brahmana, ye Nagas, had been devoted to the good of all
creatures. Neither deities, nor Gandharvas, nor Asuras, nor Nagas, can
be regarded as superior to those creatures that attain to this excellent
end of coming into the solar disc?--Even such, O regenerate one, was the
wonderful incident that I beheld on that occasion. That Brahmana, who
was crowned with success by the observance of the Unccha vow and who
thus obtained an end that persons crowned with ascetic success acquire,
to this day, O regenerate one, goes round the Earth, staying in the disc
of Surya!'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_356"></span>[215:1](m12c062.htm#fr_356.md) It has been
explained in the previous sections that the *Unccha* vow consists in
subsisting on grains picked up from the fields after the corn has been
reaped and taken away by the owners. It is a most difficult vow to
observe. The merit attaching to it is, therefore, very great.
