### SECTION CXCIII

"Yudhishthira said, 'I think, O grandsire, that thou art acquainted with
everything, O thou that art conversant with duties. I desire to hear
thee discourse to me, O sinless one, of the ordinances about conduct.'

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

"Bhishma said, 'They that are of bad conduct, of bad acts, of wicked
understanding, and excessive rashness, are called evil or wicked men.
They, however, that are called good are distinguished by purity of
conduct and practices. They are good men who never answer calls of
nature on the high roads, in cow-pens, or in fields overgrown with
paddy. Having finished the necessary acts one should perform his
ablutions in river-water and gratify the deities with oblations of
water. This is said to be the duty of all men. Surya should be always
worshipped. One should not sleep after sunrise. Morning and evening the
prayers (ordained in the scriptures) should be said, sitting with face
turned towards the east and towards the west respectively. Washing the
five limbs, <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89.md) one should eat silently
with face turned towards the east. One should never disparage the food
which one is to eat. One should eat food that is good to the taste.
After eating one should wash one's hands and rise. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_90.md) One should never go to sleep at night with
wet feet. The celestial *Rishi* Narada said that these are indications
of good conduct. One should every day circumambulate a sacred spot, a
bull, a sacred image, a cow-pen, a place where four roads meet, a pious
Brahmana, and sacred tree. One should not make distinctions between
one's guests and attendants and kinsmen in matters of food. Equality (in
this respect) with servants is applauded. Eating (twice a day) in the
morning and evening is an ordinance of the gods. It is not laid down
that one should eat (once more) at any intermediate period. He who eats
according to this rule acquires the merit of a fast. <span
id="fr_91"></span>[3](#fn_91.md) At the hours ordained for *Homa* one
should pour libations on the sacred fire. Without seeking the
companionship of other people's wives, the man of wisdom who seeks his
own wife in her season acquires the merit of *Brahmacharyya*. The
remnants of a Brahmana's dish are like ambrosia. They are like the
lacteal sustenance that is yielded by the mother's breast. People highly
prize those remnants. The good, by eating them attain to Brahma. He who
pounds turf to clay (for making sacrificial altars), or he who cuts
grass (for making sacrificial fuel), or he who uses his nails only (and
not weapons of any kind) for eating (sanctified meat), or he who always
subsists on the remnants of Brahmana's dishes, or he who acts, induced
by desire for reward, has not to live long in the world. <span
id="fr_92"></span>[4](#fn_92.md) One who has abstained from meat (under any
vow) should not take meat even if it be sanctified with *mantras* from
the *Yajurveda*. One should also avoid the flesh about the vertebral

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

column (of any animal) and the flesh of animals not slain in
sacrifices. <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md) Whether at one's own
place or in a strange land, one should never cause one's guest to fast.
Having obtained alms and other fruits of optional acts, one should offer
them to one's seniors. One should offer seats to one's seniors and
salute them with respect. By worshipping one's seniors, one obtains long
life, fame, and prosperity. One should never behold the Sun at the
moment of rising, nor should one turn one's gaze towards a naked woman
that is another man's spouse. Congress with one's wife (in her season)
is not sinful but it is an act that should always be done in privacy.
The heart of all sacred spots and shrines is the Preceptor. The heart of
all pure and cleansing things is Fire. All acts done by a good and pious
person are good and laudable, including even the touching of the hair of
a cow's tail. Every time one meets with another, one should make polite
enquiries. The saluting of Brahmanas every morning and evening is
ordained. In temples of gods, amid cows, in performing the rites of
religion laid down for Brahmanas, in reading the Vedas, and in eating,
the right hand should be raised. <span id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_94.md) The
worship of Brahmanas, morning and evening, according to due rites,
produces great merit. In consequence of such worship the stock-in-trade
of the merchant, become abundant and the produce of the agriculturist.
Great also becomes the yield of all kinds of corn and the supply of all
articles that the senses can enjoy becomes copious. When giving eatables
to another (seated at his dish), one should say, '*Is it sufficient*?'
When presenting drink, one should ask, '*Will it gratify*,' and when
giving sweetened milk and rice, or sugared gruel of barley, or milk with
sesame or pease, one should ask '*Has it fallen*?' <span
id="fr_95"></span>[3](#fn_95.md) After shaving, after spitting, after
bathing, and after eating, people should worship Brahmanas with
reverence, Such worship is sure to bestow longevity on sickly men. One
should not pass urine with face turned towards the sun, nor should one
see one's own excreta. One should not lie on the same bed with a woman,
nor eat with her. In addressing seniors one should never apply the
pronoun you to them or take their names. Thouing or the taking of names
is not censurable in addressing inferiors or equals in age. <span
id="fr_96"></span>[4](#fn_96.md) The hearts of sinful men betray the sins
committed by them. Those sinful men that conceal their conscious sins
from good men meet with destruction. Only ignorant fools seek to conceal
the sins which they commit consciously. It is true that human beings do
not see those sins but the gods see them. A sin concealed by another sin
leads to fresh sins. An act of merit, again, if concealed by an act of
merit, increases the merit. The acts of a

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

virtuous man always follow in the wake of virtue. A man destitute of
understanding never thinks of the sins committed by him. Those sins,
however, overtake the doer that has fallen away from the scriptures. As
Rahu comes to Chandra (at his proper time), those sinful acts come to
the foolish man. <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_97.md) The objects that
are stored with expectation are scarcely enjoyed. Such storing is never
applauded by the wise, for death waits for no one (but snatches his prey
whether the latter be ready or unready). The wise have said that the
righteousness of all creatures is an attribute of the mind. For this
reason, one should, in one's mind, do good to all. <span
id="fr_98"></span>[2](#fn_98.md) One should practise virtue singly. In the
practice of virtue one has no need for the help of others. If one
obtains only the ordinances of the scriptures, what can an associate
do? <span id="fr_99"></span>[3](#fn_99.md) Righteousness is the origin of
mankind. Righteousness is the ambrosia of the gods. After death, men
enjoy, through Righteousness, eternal happiness.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_89"></span>[43:1](m12b020.htm#fr_89.md) The five limbs which
should be washed before eating are the two feet, the two hands, and the
face.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[43:2](m12b020.htm#fr_90.md) This may be a general
direction for washing one's hand after eating; or, it may refer to the
final *Gandusha*, *i.e.*, the act of taking a little water in the right
hand, raising it to the lips, and throwing it down, repeating a short
formula.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[43:3](m12b020.htm#fr_91.md) The Burdwan translator
has misunderstood this verse completely.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[43:4](m12b020.htm#fr_92.md) It is difficult to
understand what this verse means. Nilakantha proposes two different
kinds of interpretation. What then is *Sankusuka* or *Sanku cuka*? The
above version is offered tentatively. The commentator imagines that the
true sense of the verse is that it declares such men to be unable to
attain to *Mahadayu* which is *Brahma* and not long life.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[44:1](m12b020.htm#fr_93.md) *Prishtamangsa* is
explained by the commentator as 'the meat forming the remnant of a
*Sraddha* offering.' I do not see the necessity of discarding the
obvious meaning.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[44:2](m12b020.htm#fr_94.md) in the sense of being
moved or used. The commentator adds that the sacred thread also should
be wound round the thumb, as the *Grihyasutras* declare.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[44:3](m12b020.htm#fr_95.md) In every instance, the
person who receives should say--'*All-sufficient*' '*Gratify to the
fill*', and '*Has fallen copiously*' or words to that effect. *Krisara*
or *Kricara* is food made of rice and pease, or rice and sesame;
probably what is now called *Khichree*.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[44:4](m12b020.htm#fr_96.md) The polite form of
address is *Bhavan*. It is in the third person singular. The second
person is avoided, being too direct.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[45:1](m12b020.htm#fr_97.md) It is not plain in
what way the sinful acts come to the sinner. The Hindu idea, of course,
is that the consequences of those deeds visit the doer without fail.
This verse, however, seems to say that the recollection of those sins
forces itself upon the sinner and makes him miserable in spite of
himself.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[45:2](m12b020.htm#fr_98.md) The Hindu moralist, in
this verse, declares the same high morality that Christ himself
preached. Merit or sin, according to him, does not depend on the overt
act alone. Both depend on the mind. Hence the injunction against even
mentally harming others.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[45:3](m12b020.htm#fr_99.md) The sense seems to be
that if one succeeds in ascertaining the ordinances about virtue or
Piety, but if the mind be sinful, no associate can be of any help. The
mind alone is the cause of virtue and piety.
