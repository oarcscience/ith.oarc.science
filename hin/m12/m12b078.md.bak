### SECTION CCLI

"Vyasa said, 'One should not show any affection for scents and tastes
and

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

other kinds of enjoyment. Nor should one accept ornaments and other
articles contributing to the enjoyment of the senses of scent and taste.
One should not covet honour and achievements and fame. Even this is the
behaviour of a Brahmana possessed of vision. <span
id="fr_568"></span>[1](#fn_568.md) He that hath studied all the Vedas,
having waited dutifully on his preceptor and observed the vow of
Brahmacharya, he that knows all the Richs, Yajuses, and Samans, is not a
regenerate person. <span id="fr_569"></span>[2](#fn_569.md) One that
behaves towards all creatures as if one is their kinsman, and one that
is acquainted with *Brahma*, is said to be conversant with all the
Vedas. One that is divested of desire (being contented with knowledge of
the Soul), never dies. It is by such a behaviour and such a frame of
mind that one becomes a truly regenerate person. <span
id="fr_570"></span>[3](#fn_570.md) Having performed only various kinds of
religious rites and diverse sacrifices completed with gift of
*Dakshina*, one does not acquire the status of a Brahmana if he is
devoid of compassion and hath not given up desire. <span
id="fr_571"></span>[4](#fn_571.md) When one ceases to fear all creatures
and when all creatures cease to fear one, when one never desires for
anything nor cherishes aversion for anything, then he is said to attain
to the status of *Brahma*. When one abstains from injuring all creatures
in thought, speech, and act, then he is said to acquire the status of
*Brahma*. There is only one kind of bondage in this world, *viz*., the
bondage of desire, and no other. One that is freed from the bondage of
desire attains to the status of *Brahma*. Freed from desire like the
Moon emerged from murky clouds, the man of wisdom, purged of all stains,
lives in patient expectation of his time. That person into whose mind
all sorts of desire enter like diverse streams falling into the ocean
without being able to enhance its limits by their discharge, succeeds in
obtaining tranquillity, but not he who cherishes desire for all earthly
objects. Such a person becomes happy in consequence of the fruition of
all his wishes, and not he who cherishes desire for earthly objects. The
latter, even if he attains to heaven, has to fall away from it. <span
id="fr_572"></span>[5](#fn_572.md) The Vedas have truth for their recondite
object. Truth hath the subjugation of the senses for its recondite
object. The subjugation of the senses hath charity for its recondite
object. Charity hath penance for its recondite object. Penance hath
renunciation for its recondite object. Renunciation hath happiness for
its recondite object. Happiness hath heaven for its recondite object.
Heaven hath tranquillity for its recondite object. <span
id="fr_573"></span>[6](#fn_573.md) For the sake of contentment

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

thou shouldst wish to obtain a serene understanding which is a precious
possession, being indicative of Emancipation, and which, scorching grief
and all purposes or doubts together with thirst, destroys them
completely in the end. <span id="fr_574"></span>[1](#fn_574.md) One
possessed of those six attributes, *viz*., contentment, grieflessness,
freedom from attachment, peacefulness, cheerfulness, and freedom from
envy, is sure to become full or complete. <span
id="fr_575"></span>[2](#fn_575.md) They that, transcending all
consciousness of body, know the Soul which resides within the body and
which is understood by only persons of wisdom with the aid of the six
entities (already mentioned, *viz*., the Vedas and truth, etc.) when
endowed with only the attribute of Sattwa, and with the aid also of the
other three (*viz*., instruction, meditation and Yoga), succeed in
attaining to Emancipation. <span id="fr_576"></span>[3](#fn_576.md) The man
of wisdom, by understanding the Soul which presides within the body,
which is divested of the attributes of birth and death, which exists in
its own nature, which being uninvested with attributes requires no act
of purification, and which is identical with *Brahma*, enjoys beatitude
that knows no termination. The gratification that the man of wisdom
obtains by restraining his mind from wandering in all directions and
fixing it wholly on the Soul is such that its like cannot be attained by
one through any other means. He is said to be truly conversant with the
Vedas who is conversant with that which gratifies one whose stomach is
empty, which pleases one who is indigent, and which invigorates one
whose limbs are dry. Suspending his senses that have been duly
restrained from unworthy indulgence, he who lives engaged in Yoga
meditation, is said to be a Brahmana. Such a person is said to be
distinguished above others. Such a person is said to derive his joys
from the Soul. With reference to one who lives after having weakened
desire and devoting himself to the highest topic of existence, it should
be said that his happiness is continuously enhanced like the lunar disc
(in the lighted fortnight). <span id="fr_577"></span>[4](#fn_577.md) Like
the

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Sun dispelling darkness, felicity dispels the
sorrows of that Yogin who transcends both the gross and the subtile
elements, as also *Mahat* and the Unmanifest. <span
id="fr_578"></span>[1](#fn_578.md) Decrepitude and death cannot assail that
Brahmana who has got beyond the sphere of acts, who has transcended the
destruction of the *Gunas* themselves, and who is no longer attached to
worldly objects. <span id="fr_579"></span>[2](#fn_579.md) Indeed, when the
Yogin, freed from everything, lives in a state transcending both
attachment and aversion, he is said to transcend even in this life his
senses and all their objects. That Yogin, who having transcended
Prakriti attains to the Highest Cause, becomes freed from the obligation
of a return to the world in consequence of his having attained to that
which is the highest.'" <span id="fr_580"></span>[3](#fn_580.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_568"></span>[211:1](m12b078.htm#fr_568.md) The commentator
explains that *tasya tasya* has reference to *gandhadeh*. *Pracharah*
means *vyavahara*. *Pasyatah* is *Vidushah*.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[211:2](m12b078.htm#fr_569.md) *i.e.*, one that
only knows the Vedas and has observed the vow of Brahmacharya is not a
superior Brahmana. To become so requires something more.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[211:3](m12b078.htm#fr_570.md) I follow the
commentator closely in rendering this verse. *Sarvavit* is taken in the
sense of *Brahmavit*. *Akamah* is one contented with knowledge of Self.
Such a man, the *Srutis* declare, never dies or perishes. The two
negatives in the last clause nullify each other. The Burdwan translator,
with the gloss before him, for he cites copiously from it,
misunderstands the negatives. K.P. Singha is correct.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[211:4](m12b078.htm#fr_571.md) *Avidhanat* is
explained as *dayanaishkainyayorananusaranat*.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[211:5](m12b078.htm#fr_572.md) *Kamakantah* is
explained as *kamaih kantah*, *i.e.*, *manoharah*.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[211:6](m12b078.htm#fr_573.md) Heaven is *Brahma*
invested with attributes. Tranquillity of soul is *Brahma* uninvested
with attributes. *Upanishat* is explained as *rahasyam*. This 'render
'recondite object'. <span id="page_212">p. 212</span> The sense of the
verse is that each of the things mentioned is useless without that which
comes next; and as tranquillity or *Brahma* uninvested with attributes
is the ultimate end, the Vedas and truth, etc., are valuable only
because they lead to tranquillity.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[212:1](m12b078.htm#fr_574.md) Both the Vernacular
translators have rendered this verse wrongly. In the first place,
*ichcchasi* is equivalent to *ichccheta*. *Santoshat* is 'for the sake
of *santosha*. *Sattwam* is *buddhiprasadam*. *Manas* is explained as
*sankalpa* or *samsaya*. The grammatical order is *sokamanasoh santapya
kledanam*. The commentator adds *santapamiti namulantam*, *i.e.*, formed
by the suffix *namul*.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[212:2](m12b078.htm#fr_575.md) *Samagrah* is
literally 'full or complete,' implying that such a man becomes
*jnana-triptah*. Only five attributes are mentioned in this verse but
*santosha* mentioned in verse 13 should be taken to make up six.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[212:3](m12b078.htm#fr_576.md) Both the vernacular
translators have rendered this verse incorrectly. In the first place
*shadbhih* has reference to the six things mentioned in verse 11 and 12
above. These six again should be *satwagunopetaih*, *i.e.*, destitute of
the attributes of *Rajas* and *Tamas*. Unless freed from those two, even
the six, of themselves, will not lead to knowledge of the Soul.
*Tribhih* has reference to *Sravana*, *manana*, and *nididhyasana*.
*Ihastham* is 'residing within the body.' *Pretya* implies transcending
consciousness of body or *jivati eva dehe dehabhimanadutthaya*. *Tam
gunam is muktalakshanam*. The sense, in simple words, is this:
transcending all consciousness of body they that succeed in knowing the
Soul which resides within the body become emancipated. The first line of
the verse simply points out how the Soul may be known.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[212:4](m12b078.htm#fr_577.md) *Anweti* is
explained as *vardhate*.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[213:1](m12b078.htm#fr_578.md) The reading I adopt
is *saviseshani*, and not *aviseshani* although the latter is not
incorrect. In treatises on *yoga*, *viseshah* imply the gross elements
and the eleven senses including the mind. *Aviseshah* imply the five
subtile elements (tanmatrani) and *buddhi*. By *Gunan* is meant *Mahat*
and *Avyakta* or *Prakriti*. If *aviseshani* be taken, the reference to
the subtile elements would imply that the grosser once have already been
transcended.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[213:2](m12b078.htm#fr_579.md)
*Atikrantaguna-kshayam*, *i.e.*, one who has transcended disregards the
very puissance that the destruction of the gunas is said to bring about.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[213:3](m12b078.htm#fr_580.md) *Karyyatam* is
Prakriti which alone is active, Purusha being inactive. *Paramam
karanam* is, of course, Brahma uninvested with attributes.
