### SECTION CCIV

"Manu said, 'As in a dream this manifest (body) lies (inactive) and the
enlivening spirit in its subtile form, detaching itself from the former,
walks forth after the same manner, in the state called deep slumber (or
death), the subtile form with all the senses becomes inactive and the
Understanding, detached from it remains awake. The same is the case with
Existence and Non-Existence. <span id="fr_183"></span>[2](#fn_183.md) As
when quantity of water is clear, images reflected in it can be

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

seen by the eye, after the same manner, if the senses be unperturbed,
the Soul is capable of being viewed by the understanding. If, however,
the quantity of water gets stirred, the person standing by it can no
longer see those images. Similarly, if the senses become perturbed, the
Soul can no longer be seen by the understanding. Ignorance begets
Delusion. Delusion affects the mind. When the mind becomes vitiated, the
five senses which have the mind for their refuge become vitiated also.
Surcharged with Ignorance, and sunk in the mire of worldly objects, one
cannot enjoy the sweets of contentment or tranquillity. The Soul (thus
circumstanced), [undetached](errata.htm#68.md) from its good and evil acts,
returns repeatedly unto the objects of the world, in consequence of sin
one's thirst is never slaked. One's thirst is slaked only when one's sin
is destroyed. In consequence of attachment to worldly objects, which has
a tendency to perpetuate itself, one wishes for things other than those
for which one should wish, and accordingly fails to attain to the
Supreme. <span id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_184.md) From the destruction of
all sinful deeds, knowledge arises in men. Upon the appearance of
Knowledge, one beholds one's Soul in one's understanding even as one
sees one's own reflection in a polished mirror. One obtains misery in
consequence of one's senses being unrestrained. One obtains happiness in
consequence of one's senses being restrained. Therefore, one should
restrain one's mind by self-effort from objects apprehended by the
senses. <span id="fr_185"></span>[2](#fn_185.md) Above the senses is the
mind; above the mind is the understanding; above the understanding is
the Soul; above the Soul is the Supreme or Great. From the Unmanifest
hath sprung the Soul; from the Soul hath sprung the Understanding; from
the Understanding hath sprung the Mind. When the Mind becomes associated
with the senses, then it apprehends sound and the other objects of the
senses. He who casts off those objects, as also all that are manifest,
he who liberates himself from all things that arise from primordial
matter, being so freed, enjoys immortality. <span
id="fr_186"></span>[3](#fn_186.md) The Sun rising diffuses his rays. When
he sets, he withdraws unto himself those very rays that were diffused by
him. After the same manner, the Soul, entering the body, obtains the
fivefold objects of the senses by diffusing over them his rays
represented by the senses. When, however, he turns back, he is said to
set by withdrawing those rays unto himself. <span
id="fr_187"></span>[4](#fn_187.md) Repeatedly led along the path that is
created by acts, he obtains the fruits of his acts in consequence of his
having followed the practice of acts. <span
id="fr_188"></span>[5](#fn_188.md) Desire for the objects of the senses
keeps away from a person who does not indulge in such desire. The very
principle of desire, however, leaves him who has

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

beheld his soul, which, of course, is entirely free from desire. <span
id="fr_189"></span>[1](#fn_189.md) When the Understanding, freed from
attachment to the objects of the senses, becomes fixed in the mind, then
does one succeed in attaining to *Brahma*, for it is there that the mind
with the understanding withdrawn into it can possibly be extinguished.
*Brahma* is not an object of touch, or of hearing, or of taste, or of
sight, or of smell, or of any deductive inference from the Known. Only
the Understanding (when withdrawn from everything else) can attain to
it. All objects that the mind apprehends through 'the senses are capable
of being withdrawn into the mind; the mind can be withdrawn into the
understanding; the Understanding can be withdrawn into the Soul, and the
Soul into the Supreme. <span id="fr_190"></span>[2](#fn_190.md) The senses
cannot contribute to the success of the mind. The mind cannot apprehend
the Understanding. The Understanding cannot apprehend the manifested
Soul. The Soul, however, which is subtile, beholds those all.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_183"></span>[74:2](m12b031.htm#fr_183.md) This is a very
difficult verse and the distinction involved in it are difficult to
catch. Of course, I follow the commentator in rendering it. What is said
here is that in a dream, *Vyakta* (manifest body) lies inactive, while
the *Chetanam* (the subtile form) walks forth. In the state called
*Sushupti* (deep slumber which is like death) the *indriyasamyuktam*
(the subtile form) is abandoned, and *Jnanam* (the Understanding),
detached from the former, remains. After this manner, *abhava*
(non-existence, *i.e.*, Emancipation) results from destruction of
*bhavah* or existence as subject to its known conditions of dependence
on time, manner of apprehension, etc., for Emancipation is absorption
into the Supreme Soul which is independent of all the said conditions.
The commentator explains that these observations become necessary to
show that Emancipation is possible. In the previous section the speaker
drew repeated illustrations for showing that the soul, to be manifest,
depended on the body. The hearer is, therefore, cautioned against the
impression that the soul's dependence on the body is of such an
indissoluble kind that it is incapable of detachment from the body,
which of course, is necessary for Emancipation or absorption into the
Supreme Soul.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[75:1](m12b031.htm#fr_184.md) *Caswasasya* is an
instance of *Bhavapradhananirdesa*, *i.e.*, of a reference to the
principal [attribute](errata.htm#69.md) connected by it.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[75:2](m12b031.htm#fr_185.md) *Indriaih rupyante*
or *nirupyante*, hence *Indriyarupani*.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[75:3](m12b031.htm#fr_186.md) The objects to be
abandoned are those which the senses apprehend and those which belong to
primordial matter. Those last, as distinguished from the former, are, of
course, all the *linga* or subtile forms or existents which are made up
of the *tanmatras* of the grosser elements.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[75:4](m12b031.htm#fr_187.md) Or, regains his real
nature.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[75:5](m12b031.htm#fr_188.md) I adopt the Bombay
reading *aptavan* instead of the Bengal reading *atmavit*. *Pravrittam
Dharmam*, as explained previously, is that *Dharma* or practice in which
there is *pravritti* and not *nivritti* or abstention.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[76:1](m12b031.htm#fr_189.md) The sense is this:
by abstaining from the objects of the senses one may conquer one's
desire for them. But one does not succeed by that method alone in
totally freeing oneself from the very principle of desire. It is not
till one succeeds in beholding one's soul that one's principle of desire
itself becomes suppressed.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[76:2](m12b031.htm#fr_190.md) The separate
existence of an objective world is denied in the first clause here. All
objects of the senses are said here to have only a subjective existence;
hence the possibility of their being withdrawn into the mind. The latest
definition of matter, in European philosophy, is that it is a permanent
possibility of sensations.
