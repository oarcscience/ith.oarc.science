### SECTION CCXV

"Bhishma said, 'Living creatures, by being attached to objects of the
senses which are always fraught with evil, become helpless. Those
high-souled persons, however, who are not attached to them, attain to
the highest end. The man of intelligence, beholding the world
over-whelmed with the evils constituted by birth, death, decrepitude,
sorrow, disease, and anxieties, should exert themselves for the
attainment of Emancipation. He should be pure in speech, thought, and
body; he should be free from pride. Of tranquil soul and possessed of
knowledge, he should lead a life of mendicancy, and pursue happiness
without being attached to any worldly object. Again, if attachment be
seen to possess the mind in consequence of compassion to creatures, he
should, seeing that the universe is the result of acts, show

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

indifference in respect of compassion itself. <span
id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_255.md) Whatever good, acts are performed, or
whatever sin (is perpetrated), the doer tastes the consequences. Hence,
one should, in speech, thought, and deed, do only acts that are
good. <span id="fr_256"></span>[2](#fn_256.md) He succeeds in obtaining
happiness who practises abstention from injuring (others), truthfulness
of speech, honesty towards all creatures, and forgiveness, and who is
never heedless. Hence one, exercising one's intelligence, should dispose
one's mind, after training it, on peace towards all creatures. <span
id="fr_257"></span>[3](#fn_257.md) That man who regards the practice of the
virtues enumerated above as the highest duty, as conducive to the
happiness of all creatures, and as destructive of all kinds of sorrow,
is possessed of the highest knowledge, and succeeds in obtaining
happiness. Hence (as already said), one should, exercising one's
intelligence, dispose one's mind, after training it, on peace towards
all creatures. One should never think of doing evil to others. One
should not covet what is far above one's power to attain. One should not
turn one's thoughts towards objects that are non-existent. One should,
on the other hand, direct one's mind towards knowledge by such
persistent efforts as are sure to succeed. <span
id="fr_258"></span>[4](#fn_258.md) With the aid of the declarations of the
*Srutis* and of persistent efforts calculated to bring success, that
Knowledge is sure to flow. One that is desirous of saying good words or
observing a religion that is refined of all dross, should utter only
truth that is not fraught with any malice or censure. One that is
possessed of a sound heart should utter words that are not fraught with
dishonesty, that are not harsh, that are not cruel, that are not evil,
and that are not characterised by garrulity. The universe is bound in
speech. If disposed to renunciation (of all worldly objects) then should
one proclaim, <span id="fr_259"></span>[5](#fn_259.md) which a mind fraught
with humility and a cleansed understanding, one's own evil acts. <span
id="fr_260"></span>[6](#fn_260.md) He who betakes himself to action,
impelled thereto by propensities fraught with the attribute of Passion,
obtains much misery in this world and at last sinks into hell. One
should, therefore, practise

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

self-restraint in body, speech, and mind. Ignorant persons bearing the
burdens of the world are like robbers laden with their booty of
straggling sheep (secreted from herds taken out for pasture). The latter
are always regardful of roads that are unfavourable to them (owing to
the presence of the king's watch). <span id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_261.md)
Indeed, as robbers have to throw away their spoil if they wish for
safety, even so should a person cast off all acts dictated by Passion
and Darkness if he is to obtain felicity. Without doubt, a person that
is without desire, free from the bonds of the world, contented to live
in solitude, abstemious in diet, devoted to penances and with senses
under control, that has burnt all his sorrows by (the acquisition of)
knowledge, that takes a pleasure in practising all the particulars of
*yoga* discipline, and that has a cleansed soul, succeeds, in
consequence of his mind being withdrawn into itself, in attaining to
Brahma or Emancipation. <span id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_262.md) One endued
with patience and a cleansed soul, should, without doubt, control one's
understanding. With the understanding (thus disciplined), one should
next control one's mind, and then with the mind overpower the objects of
the senses. Upon the mind being thus brought under control and the
senses being all subdued, the senses will become luminous and gladly
enter into Brahma. When one's senses are withdrawn into the mind, the
result that occurs is that Brahma becomes manifested in it. Indeed, when
the senses are destroyed., and the soul returns to the attribute of pure
existence, it comes to be regarded as transformed into Brahma. Then
again, one should never make a display of one's *yoga* power. On the
other hand, one should always exert to restrain one's senses by
practising the rules of *yoga*. Indeed, one engaged in the practice of
*yoga* rules should do all those acts by which one's conduct and
disposition may become pure. <span id="fr_263"></span>[3](#fn_263.md)
(Without making one's yoga powers the means of one's subsistence) one
should rather live upon broken grains of corn, ripe beans, dry cakes of
seeds from which the oil has been pressed out, pot-herbs, half-ripe
barley, flour of fried pulses, fruits, and roots, obtained in
alms. <span id="fr_264"></span>[4](#fn_264.md) Reflecting upon the
characteristics of time and place, one should according to one's
inclinations observe, after proper examination, vows and rules about
fasts. One should not suspend an observance that has been begun. Like
one slowly creating a fire, one should gradually extend an act that is
prompted by knowledge. By doing so, Brahma gradually shines in one like
the Sun. The Ignorance which has Knowledge for its resting ground,
extends its influence over all the three states (of waking, dreaming and
dreamless slumber). The

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Knowledge, again, that follows the
Understanding, is assailed by Ignorance. <span
id="fr_265"></span>[1](#fn_265.md) The evil-hearted person fails to obtain
a knowledge of the Soul in consequence of taking it as united with the
three states although in reality it transcends them all. When, however,
he succeeds in apprehending the limits under which the two, *viz*.,
union with the three states and separation from them, are manifested, it
is then that he becomes divested of attachment and attains to
Emancipation. When such an apprehension has been attained, one
transcends the effects of age, rises superior to the consequences of
decrepitude and death, and obtains Brahma which is eternal, deathless,
immutable, undeteriorating.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_255"></span>[103:1](m12b042.htm#fr_255.md) Compassion may
sometimes lead to excess of attachment, as in the case of Bharata
towards his little deer. The universe is the result of acts because acts
determine the character of the life the soul assumes. In the case of
Bharata, he was obliged to take birth as a deer in his next life in
consequence of all his thoughts in the previous life having been centred
on a deer.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[103:2](m12b042.htm#fr_256.md) K.P. Singha wrongly
translates this verse. *Tat* should be supplied before *asnute*; there
is redundant *va* in the first line. The Burdwan translator renders it
correctly.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[103:3](m12b042.htm#fr_257.md) The *buddhi* here
referred to is intelligence cleansed by scriptures. *Samahitam manak*
is, as explained by the commentator, mind freed from anger and malice,
etc., *i.e.*, properly trained.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[103:4](m12b042.htm#fr_258.md) One should not
covet, etc., like kingdoms and thrones in the case of ordinary men.
"Non-existent objects," such as sons and wives that are dead or that are
unborn or unwed.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[103:5](m12b042.htm#fr_259.md) *Samsara*, as
explained by the commentator, means both this and the other world. It is
bound in speech in this sense, *viz*., that whatever is spoken is never
destroyed and affects permanently both the speaker and the listener, so
that not only in one life, but in the infinite course of lives, the
speaker will be affected for good or for evil by the words that escape
his lips. This fully accords with the discovery of modern science, so
eloquently and poetically enunciated by Babbage, of the
indestructibility of force or energy when once applied. How appalling is
the sanction (which is not a myth) under which evil speaking is
forbidden.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[103:6](m12b042.htm#fr_260.md) Such
self-disclosure destroys the effects of those acts and prevents their
recurrence.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[104:1](m12b042.htm#fr_261.md) Robbers laden with
booty are always in danger of seizure. Even so unintelligent men bearing
the burdens of life are always liable to destruction.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[104:2](m12b042.htm#fr_262.md) *Nishpraiharena*
means *Niruddhena* as explained by the commentator.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[104:3](m12b042.htm#fr_263.md) I adopt the reading
prakasela and the interpretation that Nilakantha puts upon it.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[104:4](m12b042.htm#fr_264.md) K.P. Singha
translates these words very carelessly. The Burdwan translator, by
following the commentator closely, has produced a correct version.
*Kulmasha* means ripe grains or seeds of the Phaselous radiatus.
*Pinyaka* is the cake of mustard seed or sesamum after the oil has been
pressed out. *Yavaka* means unripe barley, or, as the commentator
explains, raw barley powdered and boiled in hot water.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[105:1](m12b042.htm#fr_265.md) What is meant by
the first line of the verse is this. The Soul had, before the creation,
only Knowledge for its attribute. When Ignorance or Delusion, proceeding
from Supreme *Brahma*, took possession of it, the Soul became an
ordinary creature, *i.e.*, consciousness, mind, etc., resulted. This
Ignorance, therefore, established itself upon Knowledge and transformed
the original character of the Soul. What is stated in the second line is
that ordinary knowledge which follows the lead of the understanding is
affected by ignorance, the result of which is that the Soul takes those
things that really spring from itself to be things different from itself
and possessing an independent existence.
