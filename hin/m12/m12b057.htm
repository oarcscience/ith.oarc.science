<p>"Ugrasena said, 'All persons seem to be very solicitous of speaking of the merits of Narada. I think that celestial <i>Rishi</i>, must really be possessed of every kind of merit. I ask thee, tell me this, O Kesava!'</p>  
<p>"Vasudeva said, 'O chief of the Kukkuras, listen to me as I mention in brief those good qualities of Narada with which I am acquainted, O king! Narada is as learned in the scriptures as he is good and pious in his conduct. And yet, on account of his conduct, he never cherishes pride that makes one's blood so hot. It is for this reason that he is worshipped everywhere. Discontent, wrath, levity, and fear, these do not exist in Narada. He is free</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_369"></A><A HREF="m12b057.htm#fr_369">153:1</A> The Burdwan translator misunderstands the word <i>anavajnata</i>. K.P. Singha skips over it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_370"></A><A HREF="m12b057.htm#fr_370">153:2</A> The sense is this: though really unattached, he seems to be attached. In this there is especial merit. A man doing the duties of a householder, without, however, being attached to wife and children and possessions, is a very superior person. Such a one has been compared to a lotus leaf, which, when dipped in water, is never soaked or drenched by it. Some, seeing the difficulty of the combat, fly away. In this there is little merit. To face all objects of desire, to enjoy them, but all the while to remain so unattached to them as not to feel the slightest pang if dissociated from them, is more meritorious.</P>
