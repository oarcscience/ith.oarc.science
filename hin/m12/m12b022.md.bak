### SECTION CXCV

"Bhishma said, 'I shall now, O son of Pritha, discourse to thee upon the
four kinds of *yoga* meditation. The great *Rishis*, obtaining a
knowledge of the same, attain to eternal success even here. Great
*Rishis* gratified with knowledge, with hearts set upon Emancipation,
and conversant with *yoga*, act in such a way that their *yoga*
meditation may get on properly. These, O son of Pritha, being freed from
the faults of the world, never come back (for rebirth). Liberated from
liability to rebirth, they live in their original

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Soul-state. <span
id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_118.md) Freed from the influence of all pairs of
opposites (such as heat and cold, joy and sorrow, etc.), ever existing
in their own (original) state, liberated (from attachments), never
accepting anything (in gift), they live in places free from the
companionship of wives and children, without others with whom disputes
may arise, and favourable to perfect tranquillity of heart. There such a
person, restraining speech, sits like a piece of wood, crushing all the
senses, and with mind undividedly united by the aid of meditation (with
the Supreme Soul). He has no perception of sound through the ear; no
perception of touch through the skin; no perception of form through the
eye; no perception of taste through the tongue. He has no perception
also of scents through the organ of smell. Immersed in *yoga*, he would
abandon all things, rapt in meditation. Possessed of great energy of
mind, he has no desire for anything that excites the five senses. The
wise man, withdrawing his five senses into the mind, should then fix the
unstable mind with the five senses (into the Intellect). Possessed of
patience, the *yogin* should fix his mind which always wanders (among
worldly objects), so that his five gates (under the influence of
training) may be made stable in respect of things that are themselves
unstable. He should, in the firmament of the heart, fix his mind into
the path of meditation, making it independent of the body or any other
refuge. I have spoken of the path of meditation as the first, since the
yogin has first to crush his senses and the mind (and direct them to
that path). The mind, which constitutes the sixth, when thus restrained,
seeks to flash out like the capricious and flighty lightning moving in
frolic among the clouds. As a drop of water on a (lotus) leaf is
unstable and moves about in all directions, even so becomes the
*yogin's* mind when first fixed on the path of meditation. When fixed,
for a while the mind stays in that path. When, however, it strays again
into the path of the wind, it becomes as flighty as the wind. The person
conversant with the ways of yoga-meditation, undiscouraged by this,
never regarding the loss of the toil undergone, casting aside idleness
and malice, should again direct his mind to meditation. Observing the
vow of silence, when one begins to set his mind on yoga, then
discrimination, knowledge, and power to avoid evil, are gained by
him. <span id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_119.md) Though feeling annoyed in
consequence of the flightiness of his mind, he should fix it (in
meditation). The yogin should never despair, but seek his own good. As a
heap of dust or ashes; or of burnt cow-dung, when drenched with water,
does not seem to be soaked, indeed, as it continues dry if drenched
partially, and requires incessant drenching before it becomes thoroughly
soaked, even thus should the yogin gradually control all his senses. He
should gradually withdraw them (from all objects). The man that acts in
this way succeeds in controlling them. One, O Bharata, by oneself
directing one's mind and senses to the path of meditation, succeeds in
bringing them under perfect

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

control by steadfast yoga. The felicity that he feels who has succeeded
in controlling his mind and senses is such that its like can never be
obtained through Exertion or Destiny. <span
id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120.md) United with such felicity, he continues
to take a pleasure in the act of meditation. Even in this way yogins
attain to Nirvana which is highly blessed.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_115"></span>[50:1](m12b021.htm#fr_115.md) I follow the
commentator in his exposition of this verse. *Anavisandhipurvakam* is
explained as *nishkamam*. *Ubhayam* is *prachinamaihikam cha karmam*.
*Apriyam* is equivalent to *vadham*. The substance of *priyam*, etc., is
thus given: *Moksham prati tu karmanah karanatwam duranirastam*.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[50:2](m12b021.htm#fr_116.md) Aturam is explained
as pierced by lust, wrath, etc. *Asuyate* is equivalent to *dhikkaroti*.
*Janah* is explained by the commentator as *parikshakah* but it would be
better to take it as standing for people generally. *Tasya* is an
instance of the genitive for the accusative. *Tat* refers to *nindyam
karma*, *sarvatah* means *sarvashu yonishu*. *Janayati Janena dadati*.
The object of the verse is to show that sinful acts produce fear both
here and hereafter.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[50:3](m12b021.htm#fr_117.md) *Loka* is in the
locative case, the final vowel indicating to the locative having been
dropped for *sandhi*. Niravishan is an adverb, equivalent to
*samyak-abhinivesam kurvan*. *Tattadeva* means "those and those" *i.e.*,
possessions, such as *putradaradikam*. *Kusalan* is
*sarasaravivekanipunan*. *Ubhayam* is explained as *karma-mukhin* and
sadyomuktim. Bhisma here points out the superiority of the latter kind
of Emancipation over the former; hence Vedic acts or rites must yield to
that yoga which drills the mind and the understanding and enables them
to transcend all earthly influences.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[51:1](m12b022.htm#fr_118.md) The soul-state is
the state of purity. One falls away from it in consequence of worldly
attachments. One may recover it by *yoga* which aids one in liberating
oneself from those attachments.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[51:2](m12b022.htm#fr_119.md) The three words used
here are *vichara*, *viveka*, and *vitarka*. They are technical terms
implying different stages of progress in *yoga*. The commentator
explains them at length.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[52:1](m12b022.htm#fr_120.md) Everything that man
has is the product of either exertion or destiny; of exertion, that is,
as put forth in acts, and destiny as dependent on the acts of a past
life or the will of the gods or pure chance. *Yoga* felicity is
unattainable through either of these two means.
