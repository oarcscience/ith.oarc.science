### SECTION CCXVIII

"Yudhishthira said, 'By following what conduct, O thou that art
conversant with all courses of conduct, did Janaka, the ruler of Mithila
versed in the religion of Emancipation, succeed in attaining to
Emancipation, after casting off all worldly enjoyments?'

"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the following old narrative
of the particular conduct by which that ruler, thoroughly conversant
with all courses of conduct, succeeded in achieving the highest
felicity. There was a ruler in Mithila of the name of Janadeva of
Janaka's race. He was ever engaged in reflecting upon the courses of
conduct that might lead to the attainment of Brahma. A century of
preceptors always used to live in his palace, lecturing him upon the
diverse courses of duty followed by people who had betaken

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

themselves to diverse modes of life. <span
id="fr_293"></span>[1](#fn_293.md) Given to the study of the Vedas, he was
not very well satisfied with the speculations of his instructors on the
character of the Soul, and in their doctrines of extinction upon the
dissolution of the body or of rebirth after death. Once upon a time a
great ascetic of the name of Panchasikha, the son of Kapila, having
roamed over the whole world, arrived at Mithila. Endued with correct
conclusions in respect of all speculations about the diverse duties
connected with renunciation, he was above all pairs of opposites (such
as heat and cold, happiness and misery), and of doubts he had none. He
was regarded as the foremost of *Rishis*. Dwelling wherever he pleased,
he desired to place before the reach of all men eternal felicity that is
so difficult of attainment. It seemed that he went about, amazing the
world, having assumed the form of none else than that great *Rishi*,
that lord of creatures, whom the followers of the Sankhya doctrine knew
by the name of Kapila. He was the foremost of all the disciples of Asuri
and was called the undying. He had performed a mental Sacrifice that had
lasted for thousand years. <span id="fr_294"></span>[2](#fn_294.md) He was
firm in mind, and had completed all the rites and sacrifices that are
enjoined in the scriptures and that lead to the attainment of Brahma. He
was fully conversant with the five sheaths that cover the soul. <span
id="fr_295"></span>[3](#fn_295.md) He was devoted to the five acts
connected with the adoration of Brahma, and had the five qualities (of
tranquillity, self-restraint, etc.). Known (as already said) by the name
of Panchasikha, he had approached one day a large concourse of *Rishis*
following the Sankhya doctrines and enquired of them about the highest
object of human acquisition, *viz*., the Unmanifest or that upon which
the five Purushas or sheaths (already named) rest. <span
id="fr_296"></span>[4](#fn_296.md) For the sake of obtaining a knowledge of
the Soul, Asuri had enquired of his preceptor. In consequence of the
latter's instructions and of his own penances, Asuri understood the
distinction between the body and the Soul and had acquired celestial
vision. <span id="fr_297"></span>[5](#fn_297.md) In that concourse of
ascetics, Asuri made his exposition of the Immutable One, and
Indestructible Brahma which is seen in diverse forms. Panchasikha became
a disciple of Asuri. He lived on human milk. There was a certain
Brahmani of the name of Kapila. She was the wife of Asuri. <span
id="fr_298"></span>[6](#fn_298.md) Panchasikha was accepted by her as a son
and he used to suck her breasts. In consequence of this, he came to be
known as the son of Kapila and his understanding became fixed on Brahma.
All this, about the circumstances of his birth and

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

those that led to his becoming the son of Kapila, was said unto me by
the divine *Rishi*. <span id="fr_299"></span>[1](#fn_299.md) The latter
also told me about the omniscience of Panchasikha. Conversant with all
courses of duty, Panchasikha, after having himself acquired high
knowledge, (came to Janaka) and knowing that that king had equal
reverence for all his preceptors, began to amaze that century of
preceptors (by an exposition of his doctrine fraught), with abundant
reasons. Observing the talent of Kapileya, Janaka became exceedingly
attached to him, and abandoning his hundred preceptors, began to follow
him in particular. Then Kapileya began to discourse unto Janaka, who had
according to the ordinance bent his head unto him (as a disciple should)
and who was fully competent to apprehend the sage's instructions, upon
that high religion of Emancipation which is explained in Sankhya
treatises. Setting forth in the first place the sorrows of birth, he
spoke next of the sorrows of (religious) acts. Having finished that
topic he explained the sorrows of all states of life ending even with
that in the high region of the Creator. <span
id="fr_300"></span>[2](#fn_300.md) He also discoursed upon that Delusion
for whose sake is the practice of religion, and acts, and their fruits,
and which is highly untrustworthy, destructible, unsteady, and
uncertain. <span id="fr_301"></span>[3](#fn_301.md) Sceptics say that when
death (of the body) is seen and is a matter of direct evidence witnessed
by all, they who maintain, in consequence of their faith in the
scriptures, that something distinct from the body, called the Soul,
exists are necessarily vanquished in argument. They also urge that one's
death means the extinction of one's Soul, and that sorrow, decrepitude,
and disease imply (partial) death of the Soul. He that maintains, owing
to error, that the Soul is distinct from the body and exists after the
loss of body, cherishes an opinion that is unreasonable. <span
id="fr_302"></span>[4](#fn_302.md) If that be regarded as existent which
does not really exist in the world, then it may be mentioned that the
king, being regarded so, is really never liable to decrepitude or death.
But is he, on that account, to be really believed to be above
decrepitude and death? <span id="fr_303"></span>[5](#fn_303.md) When the
question is whether an object exists or does not exist, and when that
whose existence is asserted presents all the indications of
non-existence, what is that upon which ordinary people rely in settling
the affairs of life? Direct evidence is the root of both inference and
the scriptures. The scriptures are capable of being contradicted by
direct evidence. As to inference, its evidentiary effect is not much.
Whatever be the topic, cease to reason on inference alone. There is
nothing else called jiva than this body. In a banian seed is contained
the capacity to produce leaves and flowers and fruits and roots and

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

bark. From the grass and water that is taken by a cow are produced milk
and butter, substances whose nature is different from that of the
producing causes. Substances of different kinds when allowed to
decompose in water for some time produce spirituous liquors whose nature
is quite different from that of those substances that produce them.
After the same manner, from the vital seed is produced the body and its
attributes, with the understanding, consciousness, mind, and other
possessions. Two pieces of wood, rubbed together, produce fire. The
stone called *Suryakanta*, coming in contact with the rays of the Sun,
produces fire. Any solid metallic substance, heated in fire, dries up
water when coming in contact with it. Similarly, the material body
produces the mind and its attributes of perception, memory, imagination,
etc. As the loadstone moves iron, similarly, the senses are controlled
by the mind. <span id="fr_304"></span>[1](#fn_304.md) Thus reason the
sceptics. The sceptics, however, are in error. For the disappearance (of
only the animating force) upon the body becoming lifeless (and not the
simultaneous extinction of the body upon the occurrence of that event)
is the proof (of the truth that the body is not the Soul but that the
Soul is something separate from the body and outlives it certainly. If,
indeed, body and Soul had been the same thing, both would have
disappeared at the same instant of time. Instead of this, the dead body
may be seen for some time *after* the occurrence of death. Death,
therefore, means the flight from the body of something that is different
from the body). The supplication of the deities by the very men who deny
the separate existence of the Soul is another good argument for the
proposition that the Soul is separate from the body or has existence
that may be independent of a gross material case. The deities to whom
these men pray are incapable of being seen or touched. They are believed
to exist in subtile forms. (Really, if a belief in deities divested of
gross material forms does no violence to their reason, why should the
existence of an immaterial Soul alone do their reason such violence)?
Another argument against the sceptic is that his proposition implies a
destruction of acts (for if body and Soul die together, the acts also of
this life would perish,--a conclusion which no man can possibly come to
if he is to explain the inequalities or condition witnessed in the
universe). <span id="fr_305"></span>[2](#fn_305.md) These that have been
mentioned, and that have material forms, cannot possibly be the causes
(of the immaterial Soul and its immaterial accompaniments of perception,
memory, and the like). The identity of immaterial existences with
objects that are material cannot be comprehended. (Hence objects that
are themselves material cannot by any means be causes for the production
of things

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

immaterial).--Some are of opinion that there is rebirth and that it is
caused by Ignorance, the desire for acts, cupidity, heedlessness, and
adherence to other faults. They say that Ignorance (Avidya) is the soul.
Acts constitute the seed that is placed in that soil. Desire is the
water that causes that seed to grow, in this way they explain rebirth.
They maintain that that ignorance being ingrained in an imperceptible
way, one mortal body being destroyed, another starts I up immediately
from it; and that when it is burnt by the aid of knowledge, the
destruction of existence itself follows or the person attains to what is
called *Nirvana*. This opinion also is erroneous. \[This is the doctrine
of Buddhists\]. It may be asked that when the being that is thus reborn
is a different one in respect of its nature, birth, and purposes
connected with virtue and vice why should I then be regarded to have any
identity with the being that was? Indeed, the only inference that can be
drawn is that the entire chain of existences of a particular being is
not really a chain of connected links (but that existences in succession
are unconnected with one another). <span id="fr_306"></span>[1](#fn_306.md)
Then, again if the being that is the result of a rebirth be really
different from what it was in a previous phase of existence, it may be
asked what satisfaction can arise to a person from the exercise of the
virtue of charity, or from the acquisition of knowledge or of ascetic
power, since the acts performed by one are to concentrate upon another
person in another phase of existence (without the performer himself
being existent to enjoy them?) Another result of the doctrine under
refutation would be that one in this life may be rendered miserable by
the acts of another in a previous life, or having become miserable may
again be rendered happy. By seeing, however, what actually takes place
in the world, a proper conclusion may be drawn with respect to the
unseen. <span id="fr_307"></span>[2](#fn_307.md) The separate Consciousness
that is the result of rebirth is (according to what may be inferred from
the Buddhistic theory of life) different from the Consciousness that had
preceded it in a previous life. The manner, however, in which the rise
or appearance of that separate Consciousness is explained by that theory
does not seem to be consistent or reasonable. The Consciousness (as it
existed in the previous life) was the very reverse of eternal, being
only

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

transitory, extending as it did till dissolution of the body. That which
had an end cannot be taken as the cause for the production of a second
Consciousness appearing after the occurrence of the end. If, again, the
very loss of the previous Consciousness be regarded as the cause of the
production of the second Consciousness, then upon the death of a human
body being brought about by a heavy bludgeon, a second body would arise
from the body that is thus deprived of animation. <span
id="fr_308"></span>[1](#fn_308.md) Once more, their doctrine of extinction
of life (or *Nirvana* or *Sattwasankshaya*) is exposed to the objection
that that extinction will become a recurring phenomenon like that of the
seasons, or the year, or the *yuga*, or heat, or cold, or objects that
are agreeable or disagreeable. <span id="fr_309"></span>[2](#fn_309.md) If
for the purpose of avoiding these objections, the followers of this
doctrine assert the existence of a Soul that is permanent and unto which
each new Consciousness attaches, they expose themselves to the new
objection that that permanent substance, by being overcome with
decrepitude, and with death that brings about destruction, may in time
be itself weakened and destroyed. If the supports of a mansion are
weakened by time, the mansion itself is sure to fall down at last. <span
id="fr_310"></span>[3](#fn_310.md) The senses, the mind, wind, blood,
flesh, bones (and all the constituents of the body), one after another,
meet with destruction and enter each into its own productive
cause. <span id="fr_311"></span>[4](#fn_311.md) If again the existence of
an eternal Soul be asserted that is immutable, that is the refuge of the
understanding, consciousness, and other attributes of the usual kind,
and that is dissociated from all these, such an assertion would be
exposed to a serious objection,

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

for then all that is usually done in the world would be unmeaning,
especially with reference to the attainment of the fruits of the charity
and other religious acts. All the declarations in the *Srutis* inciting
to those acts, and all acts connected with the conduct of men in the
world, would be equally unmeaning, for the Soul being dissociated from
the understanding and the mind, there is no one to enjoy the fruits of
good acts and Vedic rites. <span id="fr_312"></span>[1](#fn_312.md) Thus
diverse kinds of speculations arise in the mind. Whether this opinion is
right or that is right, there is no means of settling. Engaged in
reflecting on those opinions, particular persons follow particular lines
of speculation. The understandings of these, directed to particular
theories, become wholly taken up with them and are at last entirely lost
in them. Thus all men are rendered miserable by pursuits, good or bad.
The Vedas along, bringing them back to the right path, guide them along
it, like grooms conducting their elephants. <span
id="fr_313"></span>[2](#fn_313.md) Many men, with weakened minds, covet
objects that are fraught with great happiness. These, however, have soon
to meet with a much larger measure of sorrow, and then, forcibly torn
from their coveted meat, they have to own the sway of death. What use
has one, who is destined to destruction and whose life is unstable, with
kinsmen and friends and wives and other possessions of this kind? He who
encounters death after having cast off all these, passes easily out of
the world and has never to return. Earth, space, water, heat and wind,
always support and nourish the body. Reflecting upon this, how can one
feel any affection for one's body? Indeed, the body, which is subject to
destruction, has no joy in it. Having heard these words of Panchasikha
that were free from deception, unconnected with delusion (because
discouraging sacrifices and other Vedic acts), highly salutary, and
treating of the Soul, king Janadeva became filled with wonder, and
prepared himself to address the *Rishi* once more.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_292"></span>[111:1](m12b044.htm#fr_292.md) *Mara*, *Prakriti*,
and *Purusha*, or Effects, their material Cause, and the Supreme Soul.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[112:1](m12b045.htm#fr_293.md)
*Nanapashandavashinah* is another reading which is noticed by the
commentator. It is explained as 'censurers of diverse sects of
Lokayatikas.'

<span id="fn_294"></span>[112:2](m12b045.htm#fr_294.md) *Panchasrotas*
implies the mind which is said to have five currents.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[112:3](m12b045.htm#fr_295.md) These are the
*annamaya*, the *pranamaya*, the *manomaya*, the *vijnanamaya*, and the
*anandamaya*. For particulars, *vide* Wilson's Dict.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[112:4](m12b045.htm#fr_296.md) The verb used is
nyavedayat, literally, 'represented,' *i.e.*, 'started' for discourse,
or enquired into. The Burdwan translator renders it 'exposed' or
'promulgated,' which, I think, is incorrect.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[112:5](m12b045.htm#fr_297.md) The Burdwan
translator makes a ridiculous blunder by supposing that Asuri obtained
this knowledge in consequence of the questions of his disciple. The fact
is, *samprishtah*, as correctly explained the commentator, means *samyak
prishta prasno yasya*. K.P. Singha avoids the error.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[112:6](m12b045.htm#fr_298.md) Kutumvini means at
matron or the wife of a house-holder.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[113:1](m12b045.htm#fr_299.md) Either Markandeya
or Sanatkumara, according to the commentator.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[113:2](m12b045.htm#fr_300.md) I slightly expand
*Sarvanirvedam* according to the explanation given by Nilakantha. The
Sankhya doctrine proceeds upon the hypothesis that all states of life
imply sorrow. To find a remedy for this, *i.e.*, to permanently escape
all sorrow, is the end of that philosophy.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[113:3](m12b045.htm#fr_301.md) These are the
characteristics of that Delusion under which man takes birth in this
world and goes on living till he can permanently conquer all sorrow.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[113:4](m12b045.htm#fr_302.md) The construction of
the first foot is *Atmano mrityuh Anatma*, meaning the Soul's death (or
that which is called death) is the Soul's extinction. Verse 24 recites
the opinion of the Sceptics, not that of the speaker. K.P. Singha
mistranslates the verse. The Burdwan translator renders it correctly.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[113:5](m12b045.htm#fr_303.md) This and all the
following verses are statements of the sceptic's arguments.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[114:1](m12b045.htm#fr_304.md) Verse 29 is highly
terse. The words are grammatically unconnected with one another. Only a
few substantives have been used. These represent the heads of the
different arguments urged by sceptics for showing the non-existence of
anything besides the body which is seen and felt. I have, of course,
followed the commentator in his elaboration of the sense of the verse.
There can be no doubt that the commentator is right.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[114:2](m12b045.htm#fr_305.md) Some idea may be
formed by the English reader of the extreme terseness of these verses by
attending to the elaborations contained within the
[parentheses](errata.htm#77.md) above. The exigencies of English grammar as
also of perspicuity have obliged me to use, even in the portions
unenclosed, more words than what occur in the original Sanskrit. All
these verses are cruces intended to stagger Ganesa.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[115:1](m12b045.htm#fr_306.md) Both the vernacular
translators have rendered this verse wrongly. This fact is, without
clearly understanding either the text or the gloss, they have used bits
of the gloss without being able to convey any intelligible idea. The
gloss sometimes requires gloss to make it intelligible. The commentator
says that the theory of rebirth mentioned in verse 34 is that Of the
Sugatas or Buddhists. That theory is refuted inverse 35. The objection
to the Buddhistic theory is that mere ignorance and *karma* cannot
explain rebirth. There must be an indestructible Soul. This the
Buddhists do not allow, for they believe that *Nirvana* or annihilation
is possible. The argument, as sketched, proceeds in this way: the being
that is the result of the rebirth is apparently a different being. What
right have we to assert its identity with the being that existed before?
Ignorance and *karma* cannot *create* a Soul though they may affect the
surroundings of the Soul in its new birth. The objections to the
Buddhistic theory became clear in the verses that follow.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[115:2](m12b045.htm#fr_307.md) The sense is this:
it is never seen in the world that the acts of one person affect for
good or for evil another person. If Chaitra exposes himself to the night
air, Maitra never catches cold for it. This direct evidence should
settle the controversy about the unseen, *viz*., whether the acts of one
in a previous life can affect another in a subsequent life if there be
no identity between the two beings in two lives.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[116:1](m12b045.htm#fr_308.md) It is needless to
say that I have considerably elaborated the second line of the verse, as
a literal rendering would have been entirely unintelligible. For
example's sake I give that rendering; "That which is separate
Consciousness is also different. That from which it is, does not
recommend self."

<span id="fn_309"></span>[116:2](m12b045.htm#fr_309.md) If (as has already
been said) the second Consciousness be the resulting effect of the loss
or destruction itself of the previous Consciousness, then destruction is
not annihilation, and, necessarily, after *Nirvana* has been once
attained, there may be a new Consciousness or new birth, and, thus,
after having again attained to Nirvana the same result may follow. The
Buddhistic *Nirvana*, therefore, cannot lead to that final Emancipation
which is indicated into the Brahmanical scriptures.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[116:3](m12b045.htm#fr_310.md) The Buddhists then,
according to this argument, are not at all benefited by asserting the
existence of a permanent Soul unto which each repeated Consciousness may
inhere. The Soul, according to the Brahmanical scriptures, has no
attributes or possessions. It is eternal, immutable, and independent of
all attributes. The affirmance of attributes with respect to the Soul
directly leads to the inference of its destructibility, and hence the
assertion of its permanency or indestructibility under such conditions
is a contradiction in terms, according to what is urged in this verse.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[116:4](m12b045.htm#fr_311.md) The commentator
explains that the object of this verse is to point out that the senses,
when destroyed, merge into their productive causes or the substances of
which they are attributes. Of course, those causes or substances are the
elements or primordial matter. This leads to the inference that though
attributes may meet with destruction, yet the substances (of which they
are attributes) may remain intact. This may save the Buddhist doctrine,
for the Soul, being permanent and owing consciousness, etc., for its
attributes, may outlive, like primordial matter, the destruction of its
attributes. But the speaker urges that this doctrine is not
philosophical and the analogy will not hold. Substance is conjunction of
attributes. The attributes being destroyed, the substance also is
destroyed. In European philosophy too, matter, as an unknown essence to
which extension, divisibility, etc., inhere, is no longer believed in or
considered as scientific.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[117:1](m12b045.htm#fr_312.md) Here the speaker
attacks the orthodox Brahmanical doctrine of the character of the Soul.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[117:2](m12b045.htm#fr_313.md) Possibly because
they art based on Revelation.
