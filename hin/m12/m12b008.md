### SECTION CLXXXI

"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, if gifts, sacrifices,
penances, and dutiful services returned to preceptors, are productive of
wisdom and high felicity.' <span id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_43.md)

'Bhishma said, 'If the mind becomes affected by desire, wrath and other
evil passions, it then runs towards sin. If one's acts are stained by
sin, one is obliged to dwell in painful regions. Sinful men take birth
in indigent circumstances and repeatedly suffer the pangs of famine,
woe, fear, and death. Those that are virtuous in their acts, and
possessed of faith, and that have

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

their senses under control, become born as affluent men and repeatedly
sport in festivities and heaven and happiness. Unbelievers, with their
arms manacled, are sent to regions rendered inaccessible by carnivorous
beasts and elephants and full of terrors in consequence of snakes and
robbers. What more need be said of them? They, on the other hand, who
have reverence for gods and guests, who are liberal, who are fond of
good and honest men, go, in consequence of their acts of charity, along
that happy way which belongs to persons of cleansed souls. They that
have no reverence for virtue are as vile among men as seedless grains
among corn or the gnat among birds. That which is ordained in
consequence of the acts of a past life pursues the actor even if the
latter strives his best for leaving it behind. <span
id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md) It sleeps when he sleeps and does whatever
else he does. <span id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md) Like his shadow it
rests when he rests, proceeds when he proceeds, and acts when he acts.
Whatever acts a man does he has certainly to obtain the fruits thereof.
Death is dragging all creatures who are surely destined to fall (into
orders of existence they deserve) and who are surely 'liable to enjoy or
suffer that which has been ordained as the consequence of their acts.
The acts of a past life develop their consequences in their own proper
time even as flowers and fruits, without extraneous efforts of any kind,
never fail to appear when their proper time comes. After the
consequences, as ordained, of the acts of a past life, have been
exhausted (by enjoyment or sufferings), honour and disgrace, gain and
loss, decay and growth, no longer flow or appear in respect of any one.
This happens repeatedly. <span id="fr_46"></span>[3](#fn_46.md) A creature
while still in the mother's womb enjoys or suffers the happiness or the
misery that has been ordained for him in consequence of his own acts. In
childhood or youth or old age, at whatever period of life one does an
act good or bad, the consequences thereof are sure to visit him in his
next life at precisely the same period. As a calf recognises and
approaches its parent in the midst of even a thousand kine, even so the
acts of a past life recognise and visit the doer in his new life. Washed
in water a (dirty) piece of cloth becomes clean. Similarly, men burning
in repentance obtain endless happiness by proper penances. <span
id="fr_47"></span>[4](#fn_47.md) Those that can take up their residence in
the woods and by performing austerities for a long period can wash
themselves of their sins, succeed in obtaining the objects on which they
set their hearts. As no one can mark the track of birds in the sky or of
fishes in the water, similarly, the track of persons whose souls have
been cleansed by knowledge

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

cannot be marked by any. <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](m12b009.htm#fn_48.md)
There is no need of any more eloquence or any more reference to sinful
acts. Suffice it to say that one should, with proper judgment and as
befits one best, do what is for one's good. This is the means by which
wisdom and high felicity may be achieved.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_41"></span>[20:1](m12b007.htm#fr_41.md) The auspicious
constellations are such as Pushya and others; the inauspicious are Mula
Aslesha, Magha, etc; *yajnaprasava* may also mean the *fruits* of
sacrifices.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[20:2](m12b007.htm#fr_42.md) *Anwikshikim* may also
mean '[microscopic](errata.htm#64.md)'.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[20:3](m12b008.htm#fr_43.md) The word *dattam*,
generally rendered 'gifts' or 'charity,' means and includes protection
of suppliants, abstention from injury as regards all creatures, and
actual gifts made outside the sacrificial altar. Similarly, the
maintenance of the sacred fire, penances, purity of conduct, the study
of the Vedas, hospitality to guests, and offer of food to the
Viswedevas, are all included in the word *Ishta* which is ordinarily
rendered 'sacrifice.'

<span id="fn_44"></span>[21:1](m12b008.htm#fr_44.md) *i.e.*, even if he
seeks to avoid it.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[21:2](m12b008.htm#fr_45.md) *i.e.*, becomes his
inseparable associate.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[21:3](m12b008.htm#fr_46.md) What is meant is that
if once the consequences of the acts of a past life are exhausted, the
creature (with respect to whom such exhaustion takes place), is freed
from all vicissitudes of life. Lest, however, such creatures become
emancipated, the orthodox view is that a balance is always left of both
merit and demerit, so that a new birth must take place and the
consequences of what is thus left as a balance must begin to be enjoyed
or suffered. This is not referred to here, but this is the view of all
orthodox Hindus.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[21:4](m12b008.htm#fr_47.md) The first word of this
verse is diversely read. The reading I adopt is *samunnam* meaning
drenched in water. If it be *samjuktam* it would mean united, with
filth, of course. Another reading is *samswinnam*, meaning 'drenched
with sweat.' Nilakantha explains *upavasah* here as equivalent to the
renunciation of all earthly possessions. Ordinarily it means 'fasts.'
