### SECTION CCXCIX

"Bhishma said, 'Once again Janaka, the ruler of Mithila, questioned the
high-souled Parasara endued with certain knowledge in respect of all
duties.'

"Janaka said, 'What is productive of good? What is the best path (for
living creatures)? What is that which being accomplished is never
destroyed? What is that spot repairing whither one has not to come back?
Tell me all this, O thou of high intelligence!'

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

"Parasara said, 'Dissociation (from attachments) is the root of what is
good. <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1](#fn_1058.md) Knowledge is the highest
path. Penances practised are never destroyed, Gifts also, made to
deserving persons, are not lost. When one, breaking the bonds of sin,
begins to take pleasure in righteousness, and when one makes that
highest of all gifts, *viz*., the pledge of harmlessness unto all
creatures, then does one achieve success. He who gives away thousands of
kine and hundreds of horses (to deserving persons), and who gives unto
all creatures the pledge of harmlessness, receives in return the pledge
of harmlessness from all. One may live in the midst of all kinds of
wealth and enjoyment, yet, if blessed with intelligence, one does not
live in them: while he that is destitute of intelligence lives wholly in
objects of enjoyment that are even unsubstantial. <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[2](#fn_1059.md) Sin cannot attach to a man of wisdom
even as water cannot drench the leaves of the lotus. Sin adheres more
firmly to him who is without attachment even as lac and wood adhere
firmly to each other. Sin, which cannot be extinguished except by
endurance of its fruits, never abandons the doer. Verily, the doer, when
the time comes, has to endure the consequences arising from it. <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[3](#fn_1060.md) They, however, that are of cleansed
souls and that realise the existence of Brahma, are never afflicted by
the fruits of their acts. Heedless in respect of one's senses of
knowledge and of action, one that is not conscious of one's wicked acts,
and whose heart is attached to both good and bad, becomes afflicted with
great fear. One who at all times becomes entirely freed from attachments
and who completely subjugates the passion of wrath, is never stained by
sin even if he lives in the enjoyment of worldly objects. As a dyke
built across a river, if not washed away, causes the waters thereof to
swell up, even so the man who, without being attached to objects of
enjoyments, creates the dyke of righteousness whose materials consist of
the limitations set down in the scriptures, has never to languish. On
the other hand, his merits and penances increase. As the pure gem
(called Suryakanta) absorbs and attracts to itself, the rays of the Sun,
even so, O tiger among kings, does Yoga proceed by help of concentrated
attention. <span id="fr_1061"></span>[4](#fn_1061.md) As sesame seeds, in
consequence of their repeated intermingling with (fragrant) flowers,
become in respect of quality very agreeable, even so the quality of
Sattwa arises in men in proportion to the measure of their association
with persons of cleansed souls. <span id="fr_1062"></span>[5](#fn_1062.md)
When one becomes desirous of dwelling in heaven, one

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

casts off one's spouses and wealth and rank and vehicles and diverse
kinds of good acts. Indeed, when one attains to such a frame of mind,
one's understanding is said to be dissociated from the objects of the
senses. That man (on the other hand) who, with understanding attached to
the objects of the senses, becomes blind to what is for his real good,
is dragged (to his ruin) by his heart which runs after all worldly
objects, like a fish (dragged to its ruin) by the bait of meat. Like
unto the body that is made up of different limbs and organs, all mortal
creatures exist depending upon one another. They are as destitute of
vigour as the pith of the banana plant. (Left to themselves) they sink
in the world's ocean like a boat (made of weak materials). There is no
fixed time for the acquisition of righteousness. Death waits for no man.
When man is constantly running towards the jaws of Death, the
accomplishment of righteous acts is proper at all times. Like a blind
man who, with attention, is capable of moving about his own house, the
man of wisdom, with mind set on Yoga, succeeds in proceeding along the
track (he should follow). <span id="fr_1063"></span>[1](#fn_1063.md) It has
been said that death arises in consequence of birth. Birth is subject to
the sway of death. One unacquainted with the course of the duties of
Emancipation revolves like a wheel between birth and death, unable to
free oneself from that fate. One who walketh along the track recommended
by the understanding earns happiness both here and hereafter. The
Diverse are fraught with misery, while the Few are productive of
happiness. Fruits represented by the not-Soul are said to constitute the
Diverse. Renunciation is (said to constitute the Few and that is)
productive of the soul's happiness. <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[2](#fn_1064.md) As the lotus stalk quickly leaves the
mire attached to it, even so the Soul can speedily cast off the
mind. <span id="fr_1065"></span>[3](#fn_1065.md) It is the mind that at
first inclines the Soul to Yoga. The latter then merges the former into
itself. When the Soul achieves success in Yoga, it then beholds itself
uninvested with attributes. <span id="fr_1066"></span>[4](#fn_1066.md)
Engaged amid the objects of the senses, one who regards such engagement
to be one's employment falleth away from one's true employment in
consequence of such devotion to those objects. The soul of the wise man
attains, through its

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

righteous acts, to a state of high felicity in heaven, while that of the
man who is not possessed of wisdom sinks very low or obtains birth among
intermediate creatures. As a liquid substance, if kept in a baked
earthen vessel, does not escape therefrom but remains undiminished,
after the same manner one's body with which one has undergone
austerities enjoys (without rejecting) all objects of enjoyment (up to
what are contained in the region of Brahma himself). Verily, that man
who enjoys worldly objects can never be emancipated. That man, on the
other hand, who casts off such objects (in this world), succeeds in
enjoying great happiness hereafter. Like one afflicted with congenital
blindness and, therefore, incapable of seeing his way, the sensualist,
with soul confined in an opaque case, seems to be surrounded by a mist
and fails to see (the true object for which he should strive). As
merchants, going across the sea, make profits proportioned to their
capital, even so creatures, in this world of mortals, attain to ends
according to their respective acts. Like a snake devouring air, Death
wanders in this world made up of days and nights in the form of
Decrepitude and devours all creatures. A creature, when born, enjoys or
endures the fruits of acts done by him in his previous lives. There is
nothing agreeable or disagreeable which one enjoys or endures without
its being the result of the acts one has done in one's previous lives.
Whether lying or proceeding, whether sitting idly engaged in his
occupations, in whatever state a man may be, his acts (of past lives)
good or bad always approach him. One that has attained to the other
shore of the ocean, wishes not to cross the main for returning to the
shore whence he had sailed. <span id="fr_1067"></span>[1](#fn_1067.md) As
the fisherman, when he wishes, raises with the help of his chord his
boat sunk in the waters (of a river or lake), after the same manner the
mind, by the aid of Yoga-contemplation, raises Jiva sunk in the world's
ocean and unemancipated from consciousness of body. <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[2](#fn_1068.md) As all rivers running towards the
ocean, unite themselves with it, even so the mind, when engaged in Yoga,
becomes united with primal Prakriti. <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[3](#fn_1069.md) Men whose minds become bound by
diverse chains of affection, and who are engulfed in ignorance, meet
with destruction like houses of sand in water. <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[4](#fn_1070.md) That embodied creature who regards his
body as only a house and purity (both external and internal) as its
sacred water, and who walks along the path of the understanding,
succeeds

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

in attaining to happiness both here and hereafter. <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[1](#fn_1071.md) The Diverse are productive of misery;
while the Few are productive of happiness. The Diverse are the fruits
represented by the not-Soul. Renunciation (which is identical with Few)
is productive of the soul's benefit. <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[2](#fn_1072.md) One's friends who spring up from one's
determination, and one's kinsmen whose attachment is due to (selfish)
reasons, one's spouses and sons and servants, only devour one's wealth.
Neither the mother, nor the father, can confer the slightest benefit
upon one in the next world. Gifts constitute the diet upon which one can
subsist. Indeed, one must have to enjoy the fruits of one's own
acts. <span id="fr_1073"></span>[3](#fn_1073.md) The mother, the son, the
sire, the brother, the wife, and friends, are like lines traced with
gold by the side of gold itself. <span id="fr_1074"></span>[4](#fn_1074.md)
All acts, good and bad, done in past lives come to the doer. Knowing
that everything one enjoys or endures at present is the result of the
acts of past lives, the soul urges the understanding on different
directions (so that it may act in such a way as to avoid all unpleasant
fruits). Relying on earnest endeavour, and equipped with proper aids, he
who sets himself to accomplish his tasks never meets with failure. As
the rays of light never abandon the Sun, even so prosperity never
abandons one who is endued with undoubting faith. That act which a man
of stainless soul does with faith and earnestness, with the aid of
proper means, without pride, and with intelligence, becomes never lost.
A creature obtains from the very time of his abode in the mother's womb
all his own acts good and bad that were achieved by him in his past
lives. Death, which is irresistible, aided by Time which brings about
the destruction of life, leads all creatures to their end like wind
scattering the dust of sawed timber. <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[5](#fn_1075.md) Through acts good and bad performed by
himself in his past lives, man obtains gold and animals and spouses, and
children, and honour of birth, and possessions of value, and his entire
affluence.'

"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed conformably to the truth by the

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

sage, Janaka, that foremost of righteous persons, O king, heard
everything the Rishi said and obtained great happiness from it.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1058"></span>[366:1](m12b126.htm#fr_1058.md) It has been
explained in previous sections that *sreyas* or *nisreyas* means good or
excellent as applied to moral merit.

<span id="fn_1059"></span>[366:2](m12b126.htm#fr_1059.md) By *buddhiman* is
meant the man who is freed from attachment. Similarly, by *durbuddhih*
is meant the man who is the slave of attachments.

<span id="fn_1060"></span>[366:3](m12b126.htm#fr_1060.md) *Karanapekshi* is
thus explained by the commentator: *karanaphaladanatmika kriya
tannirvittyapekshi*. The sense is that sin can never be destroyed except
by endurance of its fruits.

<span id="fn_1061"></span>[366:4](m12b126.htm#fr_1061.md) The sense is that
after the manner of the fabulous gem, *Jiva* attracts to itself, through
Yoga, the status of Brahma.

<span id="fn_1062"></span>[366:5](m12b126.htm#fr_1062.md) The Burdwan
translator, without understanding the commentary, makes utter nonsense
of this verse. K.P. Singha is not far wrong, but he does not bring out
the principal point which is sought to be inculcated here. Sesame seeds
are repeatedly mixed with fragrant The more they are so mixed the more
fragrant do they become. After the same <span id="page_367">p.
367</span> manner, men acquire the quality of *Sattwa* by associating
with persons of cleansed souls. The measure of *Sattwa* is dependent on
the measure of the association.

<span id="fn_1063"></span>[367:1](m12b126.htm#fr_1063.md) The track is that
of Knowledge. Vide verse 3 above.

<span id="fn_1064"></span>[367:2](m12b126.htm#fr_1064.md) Having used the
words *vistaran* (Diverse) and *samkshepah* (Few), in the second line of
this triplet, the speaker explains their meaning in the third. By
'Diverse' is meant all those fruits that consist of unstable enjoyments;
hence, the diverse acts laid down in the Vedas and other scriptures. By
'Few' is meant Renunciation, or abstention from acts. What is said,
therefore, in this verse is this: they that betake themselves to acts,
which for their fruits all sorts of enjoyment, meet with misery; while
they that abstain from acts or practise Renunciation meet with
happiness. Both the vernacular versions are incorrect.

<span id="fn_1065"></span>[367:3](m12b126.htm#fr_1065.md) It is difficult
to understand what is meant by this verse. By progress in Yoga, the Soul
can certainly cast off the mind and other attributes by which it is
invested. The simile is unintelligible. The stalk of the lotus has its
roots in mire. Does the first line mean, therefore, that the stalk
speedily springs upwards and leaves the mire at its roots?

<span id="fn_1066"></span>[367:4](m12b126.htm#fr_1066.md) The commentator
explains that the intention of this verse is to explain that the
universe which is created by the mind is destroyed afterwards by the
mind itself.

<span id="fn_1067"></span>[368:1](m12b126.htm#fr_1067.md) The sense is that
one who has cast off objects of enjoyment and become emancipated, does
not obtain rebirth.

<span id="fn_1068"></span>[368:2](m12b126.htm#fr_1068.md) I follow the
commentator in his exposition of this verse. The practice of fishermen
(in India) is to sink their boats when they leave them for their homes,
and to raise them again when they require them the next day. They do not
leave their boats afloat for fear of the injury the waves may do to them
by tossing them too much.

<span id="fn_1069"></span>[368:3](m12b126.htm#fr_1069.md) By Prakriti here
is meant the harmony of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas. As long as these three
qualities are in harmony with one another, *i.e.*, as long as there is
no preponderance in any of them over the other two, so long there cannot
be creation or the operations of the buddhi or understanding.

<span id="fn_1070"></span>[368:4](m12b126.htm#fr_1070.md) In this verse the
word Prakriti is used in an entirely different sense. It means here
Ignorance.

<span id="fn_1071"></span>[369:1](m12b126.htm#fr_1071.md)
*Sariragriha-sanjnasya* is 'of one who regards his body to be an
accompaniment of the Soul instead of regarding it to be the Soul.' 'Who
regards purity as its sacred water', *i.e.*, who, without resorting to
the sacred waters whither others go for cleansing themselves, thinks
that purity, both internal and external, is capable of cleansing him.

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[369:2](m12b126.htm#fr_1072.md) Vide note to
verse 21 above.

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[369:3](m12b126.htm#fr_1073.md) The object of the
verse is to show that one should not, for the sake of friends and
kinsmen and spouses and children, abstain from pursuing one's true end.
The practice of charity again is the true diet which supports a man.

<span id="fn_1074"></span>[369:4](m12b126.htm#fr_1074.md) *Astapadapada* is
a weight of gold. The word, as used in this verse, means a quantity of
gold. Whether the reading be *mudreva* or *sutrena*, the sense remains
unchanged. What is said here is that the mother, etc., are like lines
traced with gold by the side of real gold; *i.e.*, the mother, etc., are
of no value or use in the acquisition of prosperity. K.P. Singha misses
the meaning. The Burdwan translator, however, makes a most ridiculous
exhibition of himself. Without understanding the commentary at all, in
fact, not having been able to read the words of the commentary aright,
he has produced a ridiculous jargon that is utterly unintelligible.
Daksha is a vocative, meaning 'possessed of cleverness.' The words *he
daksha yatha*, etc., of the commentator are read by the Burdwan Pundit
as: *deha-kshaya*, etc.'

<span id="fn_1075"></span>[369:5](m12b126.htm#fr_1075.md) *Apariharavan* is
incapable of being resisted. *Samagatih* as wind. *Asmasara-vihitam* is
'made by means of iron or the saw.' *Asmasara* stands here for
*krakacha* or *karapatra*.
