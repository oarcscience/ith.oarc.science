### SECTION CCLXVIII

"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast already explained to me, O grandsire, how
the religion of Yoga, which leads to the six well-known attributes, may
be adopted

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

and practised without injuring any creature. Tell me, O grandsire, of
that religion which leads to both results, *viz*., Enjoyment and
Emancipation. Amongst these two, *viz*., the duties of domesticity and
those of Yoga, both of which lead to the same end, which is superior?'

"Bhishma said, 'Both courses of duty are highly blessed. Both are
extremely difficult of accomplishment. Both are productive of high
fruits. Both are practised by those that are admittedly good. I shall
presently discourse to thee on the authoritativeness of both those
courses of duty, for dispelling thy doubts about their true import.
Listen to me with concentrated attention. In this connection is
instanced the old narrative of the discourse between Kapila and the cow.
Listen to it, O Yudhishthira! <span id="fr_725"></span>[1](#fn_725.md) It
has been heard by us that in days of old when the deity Tvashtri came to
the place of king Nahusha, the latter, for discharging the duties of
hospitality, was on the point of killing a cow agreeably to the true,
ancient, and eternal injunction of the Vedas. Beholding that cow tied
for slaughter, Kapila of liberal soul, ever observant of the duties of
Sattwa, always engaged in restraining his senses, possessed of true
knowledge, and abstemious in diet, having acquired an excellent
understanding that was characterised by faith, perfectly fearless,
beneficial, firm, and ever directed towards truth, uttered this word
once, *viz*.,--'*Alas ye Vedas*!'--At that time a *Rishi*, of the name
of Syumarasmi, entering (by Yoga power) the form of that cow, addressed
the Yati Kapila, saying, 'Hist O Kapila! If the Vedas be deserving (in
consequence of those declarations in them that sanction the slaughter of
living creatures), whence have those other duties (fraught with entire
harmlessness to all creatures) come to be regarded as
authoritative? <span id="fr_726"></span>[2](#fn_726.md) Men devoted to
penances and endued with intelligence, and who have the *Srutis* and
knowledge for their eyes, regard the injunctions of the Vedas, which
have been declared through and compiled by the *Rishis*, to be the words
of God himself. <span id="fr_727"></span>[3](#fn_727.md) What can anybody
say (by way of censure or praise) with respect to the contents of the
Vedas when these happen to be the words of the Supreme Being himself who
is freed from desire of fruit, who is without the fever (of envy and
aversion), who is addicted to nothing, and who is destitute of all
exertion (in consequence of the immediate fruition of all his wishes)?'

"Kapila said, 'I do not censure the Vedas. I do not wish to say anything
in derogation of them. It hath been heard by us that the different
courses of duty laid down for the different modes of life, all lead to
the same end. The

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Sannyasin attains to a high end. The
forest-recluse also attains to a high end. Both the other two also,
*viz*., the householder and the Brahmacharin, reach the same end. All
the four modes of life have always been regarded as *Deva-yana* ways.
The relative strength or weakness of these, as represented by their
relative superiority or inferiority, hath been declared in the character
of their respective ends. <span id="fr_728"></span>[1](#fn_728.md)--Knowing
these, accomplish acts which lead to heaven and other blessings,--this
is a Vedic declaration.--Do not accomplish acts,--this also is another
binding declaration of the Vedas. If abstention from acts be
meritorious, then their accomplishment must be exceedingly
reprehensible. When the scriptures stand thus, the strength or weakness
of particular declarations must be very difficult to ascertain. If thou
knowest of any course of duty which is superior to the religion of
harmlessness, and which depends upon direct evidence instead of that of
the scriptures, do thou then discourse to me upon it.'

"Syumarasmi said, 'One should perform sacrifice from desire of
heaven,--this *Sruti* is constantly heard by us. Thinking first of the
fruit (that is to be attained), one makes preparations for sacrifice.
Goat, horse, cow, all species of birds, domestic or wild, and herbs and
plants, are food of (other) living creatures. This is heard by us. <span
id="fr_729"></span>[2](#fn_729.md) Food again has been directed to be taken
day after day morning and evening. Then again the *Sruti* declares that
animals and grain are the limbs of Sacrifice. <span
id="fr_730"></span>[3](#fn_730.md) The Lord of the universe created them
along with Sacrifice. The puissant Lord of all creatures caused the
deities to perform sacrifices with their aid. Altogether seven
(domestic) and seven (wild) animals are indicated as fit for sacrifice.
Instead of all being equally fit, each succeeding one is inferior to
each preceding one. The Vedas again declare that the whole universe is
appointed for sacrifice. Him also that is called Purusha the Vedas have
appointed for the same purpose. <span id="fr_731"></span>[4](#fn_731.md)
This again hath been sanctioned by men of remote and remoter times. What
man of learning is there that does not select, according to his own
ability, individuals from among living creatures for sacrifice? <span
id="fr_732"></span>[5](#fn_732.md) The inferior animals, human beings,
trees, and herbs, all wish for the attainment of heaven. There is no
means, however, except sacrifice, by which they can obtain the fruition

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

of that desire. The deciduous herbs, animals, trees, creepers, clarified
butter, milk, curds, meat and other approved things (that are poured on
the sacrificial fire), land, the points of the compass, faith, and time
which brings up the tale of twelve, the Richs, the Yajuses, the Samans,
and the sacrificer himself bringing up the tale to sixteen, and Fire
which should be known as the householder,--these seventeen are said to
be the limbs of sacrifice. Sacrifice, the Sruti declares, is the root of
the world and its course. With clarified butter, milk, curds, dung,
curds mixed with milk, skin, the hair in her tail, horns, and hoofs, the
cow alone is able to furnish all the necessaries of sacrifice.
Particular ones amongst these that are laid down for particular
sacrifices, coupled with Ritwijas and presents (to the priests
themselves and other Brahmanas) together sustain sacrifices. <span
id="fr_733"></span>[1](#fn_733.md) By collecting these things together,
people accomplish sacrifices <span id="fr_734"></span>[2](#fn_734.md). This
Sruti, consistent with the truth, is heard that all things have been
created for the performance of sacrifice. It was thus that all men of
ancient time set themselves to the performance of sacrifices. As regards
that person, however, who performs sacrifices because of the conviction
that sacrifices should be performed and not for the sake of fruit or
reward, it is seen that he does not injure any creature or bear himself
with hostility to anything, or set himself to the accomplishment of any
worldly task. <span id="fr_735"></span>[3](#fn_735.md) Those things that
have been named as the limbs of sacrifice, and those other things that
have been mentioned as required in sacrifices and that are indicated in
the ordinances, all uphold one another (for the completion of
sacrifices) when used according to the approved ritual. <span
id="fr_736"></span>[4](#fn_736.md) I behold also the *Smritis* compiled by
he *Rishis*, into which the Vedas have been introduced. Men of learning
regard them as authoritative in consequence of their following the
Brahmanas. <span id="fr_737"></span>[5](#fn_737.md) Sacrifices have the
Brahmanas for that progenitor, and truly they rest upon the Brahmanas.
The whole universe rests upon sacrifice, and sacrifice rests upon the
universe. <span id="fr_738"></span>[6](#fn_738.md) The syllable *Om* is the
root from which the Vedas have sprung. (Every rite, therefore, should
commence with the utterance of that syllable of vast import). Of him who
has uttered for him the syllables Om, Namas, Swaha, Svadha, and Vashat,
and who has, according to the extent of his ability, performed
sacrifices and other rites, there is no fear in respect of next life in
all the three worlds. Thus say the Vedas, and sages crowned with ascetic
success, and the foremost of Rishis. He in whom are the Richs, the
Yajuses, the Samans, and the expletives

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

necessary for completing the rhythm of the Samans according to the rules
laid down in Vedic grammars, is, indeed, a Brahmana. <span
id="fr_739"></span>[1](#fn_739.md) Thou knowest, O adorable Brahmana, what
the fruits are of Agnihotra, of the Soma-sacrifice, and of the other
great sacrifices. I say, for this reason, one should sacrifice and
assist at other people's sacrifices, without scruples of any kind. One
who performs such sacrifices as lead to heaven (such as Jyotishtoma,
etc.) obtains high rewards hereafter in the form of heavenly beatitude.
This is certain, *viz*., that they who do not perform sacrifices have
neither this world nor the next. They who are really conversant with the
[declarations](errata.htm#110.md) of the Vedas regard both kinds of
declarations (*viz*., those that incite to acts and those that preach
abstention) as equally authoritative.'"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_725"></span>[256:1](m12b095.htm#fr_725.md) The redundant
syllable is *arsha*.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[256:2](m12b095.htm#fr_726.md) Both acts and
knowledge have been pointed out in the Vedas. The Vedas, therefore,
being authority for both, one or the other cannot be censured or
applauded.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[256:3](m12b095.htm#fr_727.md) *Arsha* means here
Vedic injunctions declared through the mouths of inspired *Rishis* and
compiled by *Rishis*. *Viditatmanah* is the Supreme Being himself. The
object of the speaker is to show that no part of the Vedas can be
censured, for every word in them is equally authoritative, all being
God's own.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[257:1](m12b095.htm#fr_728.md) *Deva-yanah* is
explained by the commentator as *Devam atmanam janti ebhiriti*, *i.e.*,
those by which the Soul is reached. The relative strength or weakness of
the four modes of life hath been thus indicated. The Sannyasin attains
to *Moksha* or Emancipation; the forest recluse to the region of
Brahman; the house-holder attains to heaven (region of the deities
presided over by Indra) and the [Brahmacharin](errata.htm#109.md) attains
to the region of the *Rishis*.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[257:2](m12b095.htm#fr_729.md) The commentator
explains that having commenced with the assertion that men should
sacrifice from desire of heaven, the speaker fears that the hearer may
deny the very existence of heaven. Hence, he takes a surer ground for
justifying slaughter, *viz*., the ground that is connected with the
consideration of food. Living creatures must eat in order to live. The
very support of life requires the slaughter of life. Slaughter,
therefore, is justified by the highest necessity.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[257:3](m12b095.htm#fr_730.md) *i.e.*, there are
the essential requisites of sacrifice.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[257:4](m12b095.htm#fr_731.md) The seven domestic
animals are cow, goat, man, horse, sheep, mule, and ass. The seven wild
ones are lion, tiger, boar, buffalo, elephant, bear, and monkey.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[257:5](m12b095.htm#fr_732.md) '*Vichinwita* is
*Vivechayet* with *alamvartham* understood: *atmanah* is equivalent to
*jivat*.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[258:1](m12b095.htm#fr_733.md) All the products of
the cow that are named here are not required in all sacrifices. Some are
required in some, others in others. Those then that *are* required, when
coupled with Ritwijas and Dakshina, complete the respective sacrifices
or uphold or sustain them.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[258:2](m12b095.htm#fr_734.md) *Samhritya* means
*Ekikritya* and not 'destroying' as the Burdwan translator wrongly takes
it.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[258:3](m12b095.htm#fr_735.md) The Burdwan
translator, notwithstanding the clear language of both the text and
commentary, wrongly connects the first line of verse 31 with the last
line of 30, and makes nonsense of both verses.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[258:4](m12b095.htm#fr_736.md) By taking the two
lines of 32 with the last line of 30, the Burdwan translator makes
nonsense of the passage.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[258:5](m12b095.htm#fr_737.md) 'Brahmanas' here
means that part of the Vedas which contains the ritual.

<span id="fn_738"></span>[258:6](m12b095.htm#fr_738.md) Each constitutes
the refuge of the other.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[259:1](m12b095.htm#fr_739.md) There are many such
expletives, such as *hayi*, *havu*, etc.
