### SECTION CXXXIII

"Bhishma said, 'The king should, by drawing wealth from his own kingdom
as also from the kingdoms of his foes, fill his treasury. From the
treasury springs his religious merit, O son of Kunti, and it is in
consequence of the treasury that the roots of his kingdom extend. For
these reasons the treasury must be filled; and when filled; it should be
carefully protected (by putting a stop to all useless expenditure), and
even sought to be increased. This is the eternal practice. The treasury
cannot be filled by (acting with) purity and righteousness, nor by
(acting with) heartless cruelty. It should be filled by adopting a
middle course. How can a weak king have a treasury? How again can a king
who has no treasury have strength? How can a weak man have kingdom?
Whence again can one without a kingdom obtain prosperity? For a person
of high rank, adversity is like death. For this reason the king should
always increase his treasury, and army, and allies and friends. All men
disregard a king with an empty treasury. Without being gratified with
the little that such a king can give, his servants never express any
alacrity in his business. In consequence of his affluence, the king
succeeds in obtaining great honours. Indeed, affluence conceals his very
sins, like robes concealing such parts of a feminine form as should not
be exposed to the view. Those with whom the king has formerly quarrelled
become filled with grief at the sight of his new affluence. Like dogs
they once more take service under him, and though they wait only for an
opportunity to slay him, he takes to them as if nothing has happened.
How, O Bharata, can such a king obtain happiness? The king should always
exert for acquiring greatness. He should never bend down in
humility. <span id="fr_401"></span>[2](#fn_400.md) Exertion is manliness.
He should rather break at an unfavourable opportunity than bend before
any one. He should rather repair to the forest and live therewith the
wild animals. But he should not still live in the midst of ministers and
officers who have like robbers broken through all restraints.

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Even the robbers of the forest may furnish a
large number of soldiers for the accomplishment of the fiercest of
deeds. O Bharata! If the king transgresses all wholesome restraints, all
people become filled with alarm. The very robbers who know not what
compassion is, dread such a king. <span id="fr_402"></span>[1](#fn_401.md)
For this reason, the king: should always establish rules and restraints
for gladdening the hearts of his people. Rules in respect of even very
trivial matters are hailed with delight by the people. There are men who
think that this world is nothing and the future also is a myth. He that
is an atheist of this type, though his heart is agitated by secret
fears, should never be trusted. If the robbers of the forest, while
observing other virtues, commit depredations in respect only of
property, those depredations may be regarded as harmless. The lives of
thousands of creatures are protected in consequence of robbers observing
such restraints. Slaying an enemy who is flying away from battle,
ravishment of wives, ingratitude, plundering the property of a Brahmana,
depriving a person of the whole of his property, violation of maidens,
continued occupation of villages and towns as their lawful lords, and
adulterous congress with other people's wives--these are regarded as
wicked acts among even robbers, and robbers should always abstain from
them. It is again certain that those kings who strive (by making peace)
to inspire confidence upon themselves in the hearts of the robbers,
succeed, after watching all their ins and outs, in exterminating them.
For this reason, in dealing with robbers, it is necessary that they
should not be exterminated outright. <span
id="fr_403"></span>[2](#fn_402.md) They should be sought to be brought
under the king's way. The king should never behave with cruelty towards
them, thinking that he is more powerful than they. Those kings that do
not exterminate them outright have no fear of extermination to
themselves. They, however, that do exterminate them have always to live
in fear in consequence of that act.'"

<span id="fn_401"></span>[287:1](m12a132.htm#fr_402.md) Grammatically, the
last line may mean,--'The very robbers dread a king destitute of
compassion.'

<span id="fn_402"></span>[287:2](m12a132.htm#fr_403.md) Their wives and
children ought to be saved, and their habitations and wearing apparel
and domestic utensils, etc., should not be destroyed.
