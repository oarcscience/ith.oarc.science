### SECTION CXCI

"Bharadwaja said, 'What has been said to be the consequence of gift?
What of Righteousness? What of conduct? What of Penances well-performed?
What of the study and recitation of the Vedas? And what of pouring
libations upon the fire?'

'Bhrigu said, 'By pouring libations on the sacred fire, sin is burnt. By
study of the Vedas one obtains blessed tranquillity. By gift, one
obtains pleasure and articles of enjoyment. By Penances, one acquires
blessed heaven. Gift is said to be of two kinds: gifts for the other
world, and those for this. Whatever is given to the good attends the
giver in the other world. Whatever is given to those that are not good
produces consequences enjoyable here. The consequences of gifts are
commensurate with the gifts themselves.'

"Bharadwaja said, 'What course of duties should be performed by whom?
What also are the characteristics of duty? How many kinds of duty are
there? It behoveth thee to tell me these.' <span
id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_72.md)

"Bhrigu said, 'Those wise men who are engaged in practising the duties
laid down for them succeed in obtaining heaven as their reward. By doing
otherwise people become guilty of folly.'

"Bharadwaja said, 'It behoveth thee to tell me about the four modes of
life that were formerly laid down by Brahman, and the practices ordained
for each of them.'

"Bhrigu said, 'In days of yore, the divine Brahman, for benefiting the
world, and for the protection of righteousness, indicated four modes of
life. <span id="fr_73"></span>[3](#fn_73.md) Amongst them, residence in the
abode of the preceptor is mentioned as the first (in order of time). He
who is in this mode of life should have his soul cleansed by purity of
conduct, by Vedic rites, and by restraints and vows and humility. He
should worship the morning and evening twilights, the Sun, his own
sacred fire, and the deities. He should cast off procrastination and
idleness. He should cleanse his soul by saluting his preceptor, by
studying the Vedas, and by listening to his preceptor's instructions. He
should perform

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

his ablutions thrice (*viz*., in the morning, noon, and evening). He
should lead a life of celibacy; attend to his sacred fire; dutifully
serve his preceptor; daily go out on a round of mendicancy (for
supporting himself); and give ungrudgingly unto his preceptor the whole
of what is obtained in alms. Willingly accomplishing everything that the
commands of his preceptor may indicate, he should be ready to receive
such Vedic instruction as his preceptor may give him as a favour. <span
id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74.md) On this subject there is a verse: That
Brahmana who obtains his Veda by attending with reverence upon his
preceptor, succeeds in attaining to heaven and obtains the fruition of
all his desires. The domestic mode of life is called the second (in
point of time). We shall explain to you all the pious acts and
indications of that mode. Those who having completed their residence in
the preceptor's abode return home, who are of pious conduct, who desire
the fruits of a virtuous course of behaviour with spouses in their
company, have this mode of life ordained for them. In it Virtue, Wealth,
and Pleasure, may all be obtained. It is (thus) suited to the
cultivation of the triple aggregate. Acquiring wealth by irreproachable
acts, or with wealth of high efficacy which is obtained from recitation
of the Vedas, or living upon such means as are utilised by the
regenerate *Rishis*, <span id="fr_75"></span>[2](#fn_75.md) or with the
produce of mountains and mines, or with the wealth represented by the
offerings made in sacrifices and on the termination of vows and other
observances, and those made unto deities, the householder should lead
this mode of life. That mode of life is regarded as the root of all the
others. They who are residents in the abodes of preceptors, they who
lead lives of mendicancy, and others who live in the observance of vows
and restraints to which they are pledged, derive from this mode the
means they live upon, the offerings they make unto the *Pitris* and the
deities, and, in short, their entire support. The third mode of life is
called the Forest-life. For those that lead it, there is no storing of
wealth and articles. <span id="fr_76"></span>[3](#fn_76.md) Generally,
these pious and good men, subsisting upon good food, and engaged in
studying the Vedas, roam ever the earth for journeying to tirthas and
visiting diverse realms. Standing up, advancing forward, sweet speeches
uttered in sincerity, gifts according to the measure of the giver's
competence, offer of seats and beds of the best kind, and presents of
excellent food, are some of the means for showing them regard.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

\[paragraph continues\] On this subject there is a verse: If a guest
turns away from a house with expectations unfulfilled, he is supposed to
take away the merits of the householder and leave the latter all his
misdeeds. Then again in the domestic mode of life the deities are
gratified by sacrifices and other religious rites; the *Pitris* by the
performance of obsequial rites; the *Rishis* by cultivation of (Vedic)
knowledge, by listening to the instructions of preceptors, and by
committing to memory the scriptures; and lastly the Creator by begetting
children. <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_77.md) On this subject there are
two verses: One in the observance of this mode of life should speak upon
all creatures words breathing affection and agreeable to the ears. To
give pain, to inflict mortifications, and harsh words, are all
censurable. Insult, arrogance, and deceit, also should be avoided.
Abstention from injury, truth, and absence of wrath, produce the merit
of penances in all the (four) modes of life. In the domestic mode of
life these are allowed, *viz*., the use and enjoyment of floral
garlands, ornaments, robes, perfumed oils and unguents; enjoyment of
pleasures derived from dancing and music, both vocal and instrumental,
and all sights and scenes that are agreeable to the sight; the enjoyment
of various kinds of viands and drinks belonging to the principal orders
of edibles, *viz*., those that are swallowed, those that are lapped,
those that are quaffed, and those that are sucked; and the enjoyment of
pleasures derivable from sports and every kind of amusement and the
gratification of desires. That man who in the observance of this mode of
life seeks the acquisition of the triple aggregate (*viz*., Religion,
Wealth, and Pleasure), with that of the great end of the three
attributes of Goodness and Passion and Darkness, <span
id="fr_78"></span>[2](#fn_78.md) enjoys great happiness here and at last
attains to the end that is reserved for persons that are virtuous and
good. <span id="fr_79"></span>[3](#fn_79.md) Even that householder who
observes the duties of his mode of life by following the practice of
picking up fallen grains of corn from the cracks of fields and who
abandons sensual pleasure and attachment to action, does not find it
difficult to obtain heaven.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_72"></span>[37:2](m12b018.htm#fr_72.md) It is difficult to
understand in what senses the word *Dharma* is used in the three
successive questions here.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[37:3](m12b018.htm#fr_73.md) In the first line the
correct reading is *Brahmana* and not *Brahmarshi*. The answer
attributed to Bhrigu settles this.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[38:1](m12b018.htm#fr_74.md) A pupil should never
solicit his preceptor for instruction. He should attend only when the
preceptor calls him. To this day, the rule is rigidly observed in all
*Tols* throughout India. It should be added to the credit of those
engaged in teaching that they very seldom neglect their pupils. The
story is authentic of the grandfather of the great Baneswar Vidyalankar
of Nuddea, himself as great a professor as Baneswar, of continuing to
teach his pupils in the outer apartments even after receiving
intelligence of his son's death within the inner apartments of the
family dwelling. The fact is, he was utterly absorbed in his work, that
when his good lady, moved by his apparent heartlessness, came out to tax
him he answered her, in thorough absence of mind, saying, 'Well, do not
be disturbed. If I do not weep for my son, I will do so for that
grandchild in your arms.' The pupils at last recalled him to the
realities of the hour.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[38:2](m12b018.htm#fr_75.md) *i.e.*, by picking up
fallen grains from the field after the crop has been cut away and
removed by the owner.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[38:3](m12b018.htm#fr_76.md) *Upaskara* means
renunciation.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[39:1](m12b018.htm#fr_77.md) It is generally said
that by procreating offspring, one gratifies the *Pitris* or pays off
the debt one owes to one's deceased ancestors. Here Bhrigu says that by
that act one gratifies the Creator. The idea is the same that forms the
root of the command laid on the Jews,--Go and multiply.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[39:2](m12b018.htm#fr_78.md) The end of these
attributes is *Moksha* or Emancipation.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[39:3](m12b018.htm#fr_79.md) *Sishta* is explained
by Nilakantha as one who has been properly instructed by wise
Preceptors.
