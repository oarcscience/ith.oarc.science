### SECTION CCXVII

"Bhishma said, 'He cannot be said to know *Brahma* who does not know the
four topics (*viz*., dreams, dreamless slumber, Brahma as indicated by
attributes, and Brahma as transcending all attributes), as also what is
Manifest (*viz*., the body), and what is Unmanifest (the *chit*-soul),
which the great *Rishi* 

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (Narayana) has described as Tattwam. <span
id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_276.md) That which is manifest should be known
as liable to death. That which is unmanifest (*viz*., the *chit*-soul),
should be known as transcending death. The *Rishi* Narayana has
described the religion of Pravritti. Upon that rests the whole universe
with its mobile and immobile creatures. The religion of Nivritti again
leads to the unmanifest and eternal Brahma. <span
id="fr_277"></span>[2](#fn_277) The Creator (Brahma.md) has described the
religion of Pravritti. Pravritti implies rebirth or return. Nivritti, on
the other hand, implies the highest end. The ascetic who desires to
discriminate with exactitude between good and evil, who is always bent
on understanding the nature of the Soul, and who devotes himself to the
religion of Nivritti, attains to that high end. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[3](#fn_278.md) One desirous of accomplishing this,
should know both the Unmanifest and Purusha of which I shall speak
presently. That, again, which is different from both the Unmanifest and
Purusha, and which transcends them both, and which is distinguished from
all beings, should be particularly viewed by one possessed of
intelligence. <span id="fr_279"></span>[4](#fn_279.md) Both Prakriti and
Purusha are without beginning and without end. Both are incapable of
being known by their like. Both are eternal and indestructible. Both are
greater than the greatest (of being). In these they are similar. They
are points of dissimilarity again between them. (Of these I shall speak
presently). Prakriti is fraught with the three attributes (of Goodness,
Passion, and Darkness). It is also engaged in creation. The true
attributes of Kshetrajna (Purusha or the Soul) should be known to be
different. <span id="fr_280"></span>[5](#fn_280.md) Purusha is the
apprehender of all the transformations of Prakriti (but cannot be
apprehended himself). He transcends (in respect of his original nature)
all attributes. As regards Purusha and the Supreme Soul again, both of
them are in-comprehensible. In consequence again of both of them being
without attributes by which they can be distinguished, both are highly
distinguished from all else. <span id="fr_281"></span>[6](#fn_281.md) A
turbaned person has his head circled with three folds of a piece of
cloth. (The person, however, is not identical with the turban he wears).
After the same manner the embodied Soul is invested with the three
attributes of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness. But though thus invested,
the Soul is not

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

identical with those attributes. Hence these four topics, which are
covered by these fourfold considerations, should be understood. <span
id="fr_282"></span>[1](#fn_282.md) One who understands all this is never
stupefied when one has to draw conclusions (in respect of all subjects
of enquiry). He that is desirous of attaining to high prosperity should
become pure in mind, and betaking himself to austere practices in
respect of the body and the senses, should devote himself to yoga
without desire of fruits. The universe is pervaded by yoga power
secretly circulating through every part of it and illumining it
brightly. The sun and the moon shine with effulgence in the firmament of
the heart in consequence of yoga power. The result of yoga is Knowledge.
Yoga is talked of very highly in the world. <span
id="fr_283"></span>[2](#fn_283.md) Whatever acts are destructive of Passion
and Darkness constitute yoga in respect of its real character.
Brahmacharya and abstention from injury are said to constitute yoga of
the body; while restraining mind and speech properly are said to
constitute yoga of the mind. The food that is obtained in alms from
regenerate persons conversant with the ritual is distinguished from all
other food. By taking that food abstemiously, one's sins born of Passion
begin to fade. A yogin subsisting upon such food finds his senses
gradually withdrawn from their objects. Hence, he should take only that
measure of food which is strictly necessary for the support of his body.
(Another advice that may be offered is that) that knowledge which one
obtains gradually by mind devoted to yoga should cheerfully be made
one's own during one's last moments by a forcible stretch of
power. <span id="fr_284"></span>[3](#fn_284.md) The embodied Soul, when
divested of *Rajas* (does not immediately attain to Emancipation but)
assumes a subtile form with all the senses of perception and moves about
in space. When his mind becomes unaffected by acts, he, in consequence
of such renunciation (loses that subtile form and) becomes merged in
*Prakriti* (without however, yet attaining to Brahma or Emancipation
which transcends *Prakriti*). <span id="fr_285"></span>[4](#fn_285.md)
After the destruction of this gross body, one who through absence of
heedlessness escapes from all the three bodies (*viz*., the gross, the
subtile and the *karana*) succeeds in attaining to Emancipation. <span
id="fr_286"></span>[5](#fn_286.md) The birth and death of creatures always
depend upon the cause constituted by original Ignorance

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (or Avidya). When knowledge of Brahma arises,
necessity no longer pursues the person. Those, however, that accept what
is the reverse of truth (by believing that to be Self which is really
not-Self) are men whose understandings are always taken up with the
birth and death of all existent things. (Such people never dream even of
Emancipation). <span id="fr_287"></span>[1](#fn_287.md) Supporting their
bodies by aid of patience, withdrawing their hearts from all external
objects by the aid of their understanding, and withdrawing themselves
from the world of senses, some yogins adore the senses in consequence of
their subtility. <span id="fr_288"></span>[2](#fn_288.md) Some amongst
them, with mind cleansed by yoga, proceeding according to (the stages
indicated in) the scriptures and reaching the highest, succeed in
knowing it by the aid of the understanding and dwell in that which is
the highest and which without resting on any other thing rests on
itself. <span id="fr_289"></span>[3](#fn_289.md) Some worship Brahma in
images. Some worship Him as existing with attributes. Some repeatedly
realise the highest Divinity which has been described to be like a flash
of lightning and which is again indestructible. <span
id="fr_290"></span>[4](#fn_290.md) Others who have burnt their sins by
penances, attain to Brahma in the end. All those high-souled persons
attain to the highest end. With the eye of scripture one should observe
the subtile attributes of these several forms, as distinguished by
attributes, of Brahma that are (thus) worshipped by men. The yogin who
has transcended the necessity of depending on the body, who has cast off
all attachments, and whose mind is devoted to yoga abstraction, should
be known as another instance of Infinity, as the Supreme Divinity, or as
that which it Unmanifest. <span id="fr_291"></span>[5](#fn_291.md) They
whose hearts are devoted to the acquisition of knowledge succeed first
in freeing themselves from the world of mortals. Subsequently, by
casting off attachments they partake of the nature of Brahma and at last
attain to the highest end.

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

"Thus have persons conversant with the Vedas spoken of the religion that
leads to the attainment of Brahma. They who follow that religion
according to the measure of their knowledge all succeed in obtaining the
highest end. Even those persons who succeed in acquiring knowledge that
is incapable of being shaken (by the assaults of scepticism) and that
makes its possessors free from attachments of every kind, attain to
various high regions after death and become emancipated according to the
measure of their knowledge. Those persons of pure hearts who have
imbibed contentment from knowledge, and who have cast off all desires
and attachments, gradually approach in respect of their nature, nearer
and nearer to Brahma which has the unmanifest for his attribute, which
is divine, and without birth and death. Realising that Brahma dwells in
their Souls, they become themselves immutable and have never to return
(to the earth). Attaining to that supreme state which is indestructible
and eternal, they exist in felicity. The knowledge with respect to this
world is even this: it exists (in the case of erring persons). It does
not exist (in the case of those who have not been stupefied by error).
The whole universe, bound up in desire, is revolving like a wheel. As
the fibres of a lotus-stalk overspread themselves into every part of the
stalk, after the same manner the fibres of desire, which have neither
beginning nor end, spread themselves over every part of the body. As a
weaver drives his threads into a cloth by means of his shuttle, after
the same manner the threads that constitute the fabric of the universe
are woven by the shuttle of Desire. He who properly knows
transformations of *Prakriti*, *Prakriti* herself and *Purusha*, becomes
freed from Desire and attains to Emancipation. <span
id="fr_292"></span>[1](m12b045.htm#fn_292.md) The divine *Rishi* Narayana,
that refuge of the universe, for the sake of compassion towards all
creatures, clearly promulgated these means for the acquisition of
immortality.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_276"></span>[108:1](m12b044.htm#fr_276.md) The commentator
thinks that the *Rishi* alluded to in this verse is Narayana, the
companion and friend of Nara, both of whom had their retreat on the
heights of Vadari where Vyasa afterwards settled himself. Tattwa here
does not, the commentator thinks, mean a topic of discourse but that
which exists in original purity and does not take its colour or form
from the mind. *Anaropitam rupam yasya tat*.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[108:2](m12b044.htm#fr_277.md) The religion of
*Pravritti* consists of acts. It cannot liberate one from rebirth. The
whole chain of existences, being the result of acts, rests upon the
religion of *Pravritti*. The religion of *Nivritti*, on the other hand,
or abstention from acts, leads to Emancipation or Brahma.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[108:3](m12b044.htm#fr_278.md) Nidarsarkah is
explained by the commentator as equivalent to *drashtum ichcchan*.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[108:4](m12b044.htm#fr_279.md) *Avyakta* or
Unmanifest is *Prakriti* or primordial matter both gross and subtile.
That which transcends both *Prakriti* and *Purusha* is, of course the
Supreme Soul or Brahma. *Visesham*, is explained by the commentator as
'distinguished from everything else by its attributes.'

<span id="fn_280"></span>[108:5](m12b044.htm#fr_280.md) *i.e.*, as the
commentator explains, *Purusha* is non-creating and transcends the three
attributes.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[108:6](m12b044.htm#fr_281.md) Asamhatau is
explained by the commentator as *atyantaviviktau*. *Purushau* implies
the two *Purushas*, *i.e.*, the '*Chit*-Soul' and the Supreme Soul.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[109:1](m12b044.htm#fr_282.md) The four topics are
these: the points of resemblance between *Prakriti* and *Purusha*, the
points of difference between them: the points of resemblance between
*Purusha* and *Iswara*; and the points of difference between them. The
four considerations that cover these topics are absence of beginning and
end, existence as chit and in animation, distinction from all other
things, and the notion of activity.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[109:2](m12b044.htm#fr_283.md) *Yoginastam
prapasyanti bhagavantam santanam*--even this is what people always say
to *yoga* and *yogins*.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[109:3](m12b044.htm#fr_284.md) The commentator in
a long note explains that what is really implied by this verse is that
one should betake oneself to some sacred spot such as Kasi for casting
off one's life there. Death at Kasi is sure to lead to Emancipation, for
the theory is that *Siva* himself becomes the instructor and leads one
to that high end.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[109:4](m12b044.htm#fr_285.md) When divested of
*Rajas*', *i.e.*, freed from the senses and the propensities derived
from their indulgence.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[109:5](m12b044.htm#fr_286.md) *Adehat* is
explained by the commentator as *Dehapatat*. *Dehantat* applies to the
destruction of all the three bodies. By the destruction (after death) of
the gross body is meant escape from the obligation of rebirth. The
*karana* body is a subtiler form of existence than the *Linga-sarira*:
it is, of course, existence it; *Prakriti* as mentioned in verso 21.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[110:1](m12b044.htm#fr_287.md) *Paropratyasarge*
means on the rise of a knowledge of Brahma. *Niyati* is Necessity, in
consequence of which *jiva* goes through an endless wheel of existences;
*Bhavantaprabhavaprajna* is *bhavanamanta-prabhavayorevaprajna yesham*.
The object of the verse is to show that such mistaken persons as take
the body, the senses, etc., and all which are not-Self, to be Self, are
always taken up with the idea that things die and are born, but that
there is nothing like emancipation or a complete escape from rebirth.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[110:2](m12b044.htm#fr_288.md) 'By the aid of
patience' is explained by the commentator as without leaving their seats
and changing the yoga attitude, etc. 'Withdrawing themselves from the
world of senses' means attaining to a state that is perfectly
independent of the senses and, therefore, of all external objects.
'Adore the senses in consequence of their subtility,' as explained by
the commentator, is thinking of *Prana* and the *Indriyas* as Self or
Soul. I do not understand how this amounts to the statement that such
yogins attain to *Brahma*.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[110:3](m12b044.htm#fr_289.md) 'Proceeding
according to (the stages indicated in) the scriptures'. alludes to the
well-known verses in the *Gita*, beginning with *Indriyebhyah
parahyartha*, etc. The several stages, as mentioned in those verses, are
as follows: Superior to the senses are their objects. Superior to the
objects is the mind. Superior to the mind is the understanding. Superior
to the understanding is the Soul. Superior to the Soul is the
Unmanifest. Superior to the Unmanifest is *Purusha* (*Brahma*). There is
nothing above *Purusha*. *Dehantam* is explained as that which is
superior to *Avyakta* or Unmanifest, hence *Brahma* or *Purusha*.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[110:4](m12b044.htm#fr_290.md) A flash of
lightning repeatedly realised becomes a mass of blazing light. Perhaps
this is intended by the speaker.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[110:5](m12b044.htm#fr_291.md) In the Bengal
texts, verse 28 is a triplet. In the second line the correct reading is
*Dehantam*.
