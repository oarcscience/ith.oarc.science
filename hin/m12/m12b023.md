### SECTION CXCVI

"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast discoursed on the four modes of life and
their duties. Thou hast also spoken of the duties of kings. Thou hast
recited many histories of diverse kinds and connected with diverse
topics. I have also heard from thee, O thou of great intelligence, many
discourses connected with morality. I have, however, one doubt. It
behoveth thee to resolve it. I wish, O Bharata, to hear of the fruits
that silent Reciters of sacred *mantras* acquire (by their practice).
What are the fruits that have been indicated for such men? What is that
region to which they go after death? It behoveth thee also, O sinless
one, to tell me all the rules that have been laid down in respect of
such silent recitation? When the word Reciter is uttered, what shall I
understand by it? Is such a man to be regarded as following the
ordinances of *Sankhya* or *yoga* or *work*? <span
id="fr_121"></span>[2](#fn_121.md) Or, is such a man to be regarded as
observing the ordinances about (mental) sacrifices? How is the path of
the Reciters to be called? Thou art, as I think, of universal knowledge.
Tell me all this.'

"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old history of what
transpired between Yama, Time, and a certain Brahmana. Sages conversant
with the means of attaining to Emancipation have spoken of two methods,
*viz*., the *Sankhya* and the *yoga*. Amongst these, in the former,
which is otherwise called the Vedanta, Renunciation has been preached
with respect to silent recitation. The declarations of the Vedas preach
Abstention (from rites), are fraught with tranquillity, and are
concerned with *Brahma*. <span id="fr_122"></span>[3](#fn_122.md) Indeed,
the two paths spoken of by sages bent on achieving what is for their
good, *viz*., *Sankhya* and *yoga*, are such that they are both
concerned and again

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

unconcerned (with silent recitations). <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md) The manner in which silent recitation is
connected (with each of the two paths) and the cause I shall now
explain. In both as in the case of silent recitation, are needed the
subduing of the senses and the fixing of the mind (after withdrawal from
external objects); as also truth keeping up of the (sacred) fire,
residence in solitude, meditation, penance, self-restraint, forgiveness,
benevolence, abstemiousness in respect of food, withdrawal from worldly
attachments, the absence of talkativeness, and tranquillity. These
constitute a sacrifice in acts (leading to the fruition of desire about
heaven or felicity in next life). <span id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124.md)
Listen now to the course that consists of abstention (from acts). The
manner in which the acts of the Reciter observing the vow of
*Brahmacharya* may cease, I will presently declare. Such a person should
conduct himself in every way according to what has been (already) said
by me. <span id="fr_125"></span>[3](#fn_125.md) Betaking himself to the
path of abstention, he should seek to extinguish his dependence on both
the External and the Internal. Sitting on *kusa* grass, with *kusa* in
hand, and binding his coronal locks with *kusa*, he should surround
himself with *kusa* and have *kusa* for robes. Bowing unto all earthly
concerns, he should take leave of them and never think of them. Assuming
equability by the aid of his mind, he should fix his mind on the mind
itself. Reciting the highly beneficial composition (*viz*., the
*Gayatri*), he meditates with the aid of his intellect on Brahma alone.
Afterwards he leaves off even that, being then absorbed in concentrated
contemplation. <span id="fr_126"></span>[4](#fn_126.md) In consequence of
his dependence on the strength of the *Gayatri* which he recites, this
concentrated contemplation will come of itself. By penances he attains
to purity of soul, and self-restraint, and cessation of aversion and
desire. Freed from attachment and delusion, above the influence of all
pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, joy and sorrow, etc.), he
never grieves and never suffers himself to be drawn towards worldly
objects. He does not regard himself as the actor nor as the enjoyer or
sufferer of the consequences of his acts. He never, through selfishness,
fixes his mind on anything. Without being employed in the acquisition of
wealth, he abstains also from disregarding or insulting others, but not
from work. The work in which he is employed is that of meditation; he is
devoted to meditation, and seeks meditation unalterably. By meditation
he succeeds in bringing about concentrated
[contemplation](errata.htm#67.md), and then gradually leaves off meditation
itself. In that state he enjoys the felicity which attaches to the
abandonment of all things. Having thoroughly mastered the principle of
desire he casts off his life-breaths and then enters into the *Brahmic*
body. Or, if he does not

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

desire to enter into the Brahmic body, he at once goes upwards into the
region of Brahma and has never to undergo rebirth. Having become
tranquillity's self, and being freed from all kinds of calamity, such a
person, by depending upon his own intelligence, succeeds in attaining to
that Soul which is pure and immortal and which is without a stain.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_121"></span>[52:2](m12b023.htm#fr_121.md) *Sankhya* is
understood by the commentator as implying *Vedanta-vichara*.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[52:3](m12b023.htm#fr_122.md) This verse is a
triplet. The commentator explains that *Vedanta* in the second line
means *Sankhya*. I think, this is said because of the agreement between
the *Vedanta* and the *Sankhya* in this respect notwithstanding their
difference in other respects. The object of the verse is to say that
according to the *Sankhya*, there is no necessity for silent recitation
of *mantras*. Mental meditation, without the utterance of particular
words, may lead to *Brahma*.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[53:1](m12b023.htm#fr_123.md) Both declare, as the
commentator explains, that as long as one does not succeed in beholding
one's Soul, one may silently recite the *Pranava* or the original word
*Om*. When, however, one succeeds in beholding one's Soul, then may one
give up such recitation.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[53:2](m12b023.htm#fr_124.md) There are two paths
which one in this world may follow. One is called *Pravritti dharma* and
the other *Nrivritti dharma*. The first is a course of actions; the
second of abstention from actions. The attributes indicated in 10 and 11
belong to the first course or path. They are, therefore, called
*Pravartaka yajna* or Sacrifice having its origin in *Pravritti* or
action.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[53:3](m12b023.htm#fr_125.md) *i.e.*, he should
first cleanse his heart by observing the virtues above enumerated.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[53:4](m12b023.htm#fr_126.md) *Samadhi* is that
meditation in which the senses having been all withdrawn into the mind,
the mind, as explained previously, is made to dwell on Brahma alone.
