### SECTION CCLXXXVIII

"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, what is beneficial for one
that is unconversant with the truths of the scriptures, that is always
in doubt, and

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

that abstains from self-restraint and the other practices having for
their object the knowledge of the Soul.'

"Bhishma said, 'Worshipping the preceptor, always waiting reverentially
on those that are aged, and listening to the scriptures (when recited by
up competent Brahmanas),--these are said to be of supreme benefit (to a
person like the one thou hast described). In this connection also is
cited the old narrative of the discourse between Galava and the
celestial Rishi Narada. Once on a time Galava, desirous of obtaining
what was for his benefit, addressed Narada freed from error and fatigue,
learned in the scriptures, gratified with knowledge, a thorough master
of his senses, and with soul devoted to Yoga, and said, 'Those virtues,
O Muni, by the possession of which a person becomes respected in the
world, I see, dwell permanently in thee. Thou art freed from error and,
as such, it behoveth thee to remove the doubts that fill the minds of
men like ourselves that are subject to error and that are unacquainted
with the truths of the world. We do not know what we should do, for the
declarations of the scriptures generate an inclination for (the
acquisition of) Knowledge simultaneously with the inclination for acts.
It behoveth thee to discourse to us on these subjects. <span
id="fr_960"></span>[1](#fn_960.md) O illustrious one, the different
*asramas* approve different courses of conduct.--*This* is
beneficial,--*This* (other) is beneficial--the scriptures exhort us
often in this wise. <span id="fr_961"></span>[2](#fn_961.md) Beholding the
followers of the four asramas, who are thus exhorted by the scriptures
and who fully approve of what the scriptures have laid down for them,
thus travelling in diverse courses, and seeing that ourselves also are
equally content with our own scriptures, we fail to understand what is
truly beneficial. If the scriptures were all uniform, then what is truly
beneficial would have become manifest. In consequence, however, of the
scriptures being multifarious, that which is truly beneficial becomes
invested with mystery. For these reasons, that which is truly beneficial
seems to me to be involved in confusion. Do thou then, O illustrious
one, discourse to me on the subject. I have approached thee (for this),
O, instruct me!'

"Narada said, 'The Asramas are four in number, O child! All of them
serve the purposes for which they have been designed; and the duties
they preach differ from one another. Ascertaining them first from
well-qualified preceptors, reflect upon them, O Galava! <span
id="fr_962"></span>[3](#fn_962.md) Behold, the announcements of the merits

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

of those Asramas are varied in respect of their form, divergent in
respect of their matter, and contradictory in respect of the observances
they embrace. <span id="fr_963"></span>[1](#fn_963.md) Observed with gross
vision, verily, all the Asramas refuse to clearly yield their true
intent (which, of course, is knowledge of Self). Others, however, endued
with subtle sight, behold their highest end. <span
id="fr_964"></span>[2](#fn_964.md) That which is truly beneficial, and
about which there is no doubt, *viz*., good offices to friends, and
suppression of enemies, and the acquisition of the aggregate of three
(*viz*., Religion, Profit, and Pleasure), has been declared by the wise
to be supreme excellence. <span id="fr_965"></span>[3](#fn_965.md)
Abstention from sinful acts, constancy of righteous disposition, good
behaviour towards those that are good and pious,--these, without doubt,
constitute excellence. Mildness towards all creatures, sincerity of
behaviour, and the use of sweet words,--these, without doubt, constitute
excellence. An equitable apportionment of what one has among the
deities, the *Pitris*, and guests, and adherence to servants,--these,
without doubt, constitute excellence. Truthfulness of speech is
excellent. The knowledge, however, of truth, is very difficult of
acquisition. I say that that is truth which is exceedingly beneficial to
creatures. <span id="fr_966"></span>[4](#fn_966.md) The renunciation of
pride, the suppression of heedlessness, contentment, living by one's own
self,--these are said to constitute supreme excellence. The study of the
Vedas, and of their branches, according to the well-known rules, and all
enquiries and pursuits having for their sake the acquisition of
knowledge,--these, without doubt, are excellent. One desirous of
achieving what is excellent should never enjoy sound and form and taste
and touch and scent, to excess and should not enjoy them for their sake
alone. Wandering in the night, sleep during the day, indulgence in
idleness, roguery, arrogance, excessive indulgence and total abstention
from all indulgence in objects of the senses, should be relinquished by
one desirous of achieving what is excellent. <span
id="fr_967"></span>[5](#fn_967.md) One should not seek self-elevation by
depreciating others. Indeed, one should, by one's merits alone,

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

seek distinction over persons that are distinguished but never over
those that are inferior. Men really destitute of merit and filled with a
sense of self-admiration depreciate men of real merit, by asserting
their own virtues and affluence. Swelling with a sense of their own
importance, these men, when none interferes with them (for bringing them
to a right sense of what they are), regard themselves to be superior to
men of real distinction. One possessed of real wisdom and endued with
real merits, acquires great fame by abstaining from speaking ill of
others and from indulging in self-praise. Flowers shed their pure and
sweet fragrance without trumpeting forth their own excellence.
Similarly, the effulgent Sun scatters his splendours in the firmament in
perfect silence. After the same manner those men blaze in the world with
celebrity who by the aid of their intelligence, cast off these and
similar other faults and who do not proclaim their own virtues. The fool
can never shine in the world by bruiting about his own praise. The man,
however, of real merit and learning obtains celebrity even if he be
concealed in a pit. Evil words, uttered with whatsoever vigour of voice
die out (in no time). Good words, uttered however softly, blaze forth in
the world. As the Sun shows his fiery form (in the gem called
Suryakanta), even so the multitude of words, of little sense, that fools
filled with vanity utter, display only (the meanness of) their hearts.
For these reasons, men seek the acquisition of wisdom of various kinds.
It seems to me that of all acquisitions that of wisdom is the most
valuable. One should not speak until one is asked; nor should one speak
when one is asked improperly. Even if possessed of intelligence and
knowledge, one should still sit in silence like an idiot (until one is
asked to speak and asked in proper form). One should seek to dwell among
honest men devoted to righteousness and liberality and the observance of
the duties of their own order. One desirous of achieving what is
excellent should never dwell in a place where a confusion occurs in the
duties of the several orders. <span id="fr_968"></span>[1](#fn_968.md) A
person may be seen to live who abstains from all works (for earning the
means of his living) and who is well-content with whatever is got
without exertion. By living amid the righteous, one succeeds in
acquiring pure righteousness. After the same manner, one by living amid
the sinful, becomes stained with sin. <span
id="fr_969"></span>[2](#fn_969.md) As the touch of water or fire or the
rays of the moon immediately conveys the sensation of cold or heat,
after the same manner the impressions of virtue and vice become
productive of happiness or misery. They that are eaters of Vighasa eat
without taking any notice of the flavours of the edibles placed before
them. They, however, that eat carefully discriminating the flavours of
the viands prepared for them, should be known as persons still

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

tied by the bonds of action. <span id="fr_970"></span>[1](#fn_970.md) The
righteous man should leave that place where a Brahmana discourses on
duties unto disciples desirous of acquiring knowledge, as based on
reasons, of the Soul, but who do not enquire after such knowledge with
reverence. <span id="fr_971"></span>[2](#fn_971.md) Who, however, will
leave that spot where exists in its entirety that behaviour between
disciples and preceptors which is consistent with what has been laid
down in the scriptures? What learned man desirous of respect being paid
to himself will dwell in that place where people bruit about the faults
of the learned even when such have no foundation to stand upon? <span
id="fr_972"></span>[3](#fn_972.md) Who is there that will not leave that
place, like a garment whose end has caught fire, where covetous men seek
to break down the barriers of virtue? One should remain and dwell in
that place, among good men of righteous disposition, where persons
endued with humility are engaged in fearlessly practising the duties of
religion. There where men practise the duties of religion for the sake
of acquiring wealth and other temporal advantages, one should not dwell,
for the people of that place are all to be regarded as sinful. One
should fly away with all speed from that place, as if from a room in
which there is a snake, where the inhabitants, desirous of obtaining the
means of life, are engaged in the practice of sinful deeds. One desirous
of what is beneficial should, from the beginning, relinquish that act in
consequence of which one becomes stretched, as it were, on a bed of
thorn and in consequence of which one becomes invested with the desires
born of the deeds of past lives. <span id="fr_973"></span>[4](#fn_973.md)
The righteous man should leave that kingdom where the king and king's
officers exercise equal authority and where they are given to the habit
of eating before feeding their relatives (when the latter come as
guests). <span id="fr_974"></span>[5](#fn_974.md) One should dwell in that
country where Brahmanas possessed of a knowledge of the scriptures are
fed first: where they are always devoted to the due observance of
religious duties, and where they are engaged in teaching disciples and
officiating at the sacrifices of others. One should unhesitatingly dwell
in that country where the sounds Swaha, Swadha, and Vashat are duly and
continuously uttered. <span id="fr_975"></span>[6](#fn_975.md) One should
leave that kingdom, like poisoned

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

meat, where one sees Brahmanas obliged to betake themselves to unholy
practices, being tortured by want of the means of life. With a contented
heart and deeming all his wishes as already gratified a righteous man
should dwell in that country whose inhabitants cheerfully give away
before even they are solicited. One should live and move about, among
good men devoted to acts of righteousness, in that country where
chastisement falleth upon those that are wicked and where respect and
good offices are the portion of those that are of subdued and cleansed
souls. One should unhesitatingly dwell in that country whose king is
devoted to virtue and which the king rules virtuously, casting off
desires and possessed of prosperity, and where severe chastisement is
dealt to those that visit self-controlled men with the consequences of
their wrath, those that act wickedly towards the righteous, those that
are given to acts of violence, and those that are covetous. <span
id="fr_976"></span>[1](m12b116.htm#fn_976.md) Kings endued with such a
disposition bring about prosperity to those that dwell in their kingdoms
when prosperity is on the point of leaving them. <span
id="fr_977"></span>[2](m12b116.htm#fn_977.md) I have thus told thee, O son,
in answer to thy enquiry, what is beneficial or excellent. No one can
describe, in consequence of its exceedingly high character, what is
beneficial or excellent for the Soul. <span
id="fr_978"></span>[3](m12b116.htm#fn_978.md) Many and high will the
excellences be, through the observance of the duties laid down for him,
of the man who for earning his livelihood during the time of his sojourn
here conducts himself in the way indicated above and who devotes his
soul to the good of all creatures.'" <span
id="fr_979"></span>[4](m12b116.htm#fn_979.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_960"></span>[335:1](m12b115.htm#fr_960.md) The scriptures
contain both kinds of instruction. There are declarations that are
entirely in favour of Acts or observances. There are again declarations
in favour of Knowledge. What the speaker asks is that the Rishi should
discourse upon what the speaker should do, *i.e.*, whether he should
betake himself to the acquisition of Knowledge or to the doing of acts.

<span id="fn_961"></span>[335:2](m12b115.htm#fr_961.md) *i.e.*, Each Asrama
speaks of particular observances and courses of conduct as beneficial.
This, therefore, is a source of confusion to men of plain
understandings. Is there no distinction then among duties or observances
in respect of their beneficial character? This is the question
propounded. The commentator thinks by the word *asramas* is meant the
four principal faiths and *not* the modes of life.

<span id="fn_962"></span>[335:3](m12b115.htm#fr_962.md) I retain the word
*asrama* in the English version as it is very doubtful in what sense it
has been used in the original. The commentator explains that by four
*asramas* are meant the four principal forms of creed prevalent at one
time in India. The first is that there is no <span id="page_336">p.
336</span> such thing as virtue or righteousness. This is ascribed to
Sakya Simha or Buddha. The second is that righteousness consists in only
the worship of trees, etc. The third is that only is righteousness which
the Vedas have laid down. The fourth is that transcending righteousness
and its reverse there is something for whose attainment one should
strive. *Yatha samkalpitah* is explained by the commentator as *yo yena
sreyastena bhavitastasya tadeva sreyah*.

<span id="fn_963"></span>[336:1](m12b115.htm#fr_963.md) *Gunoddesam* is
*Gunakirtanam* or the announcement of merits. What Narada says here is
this: the asramas are four. The merits of each have been proclaimed by
their respective founders. The principal merit each claims is that it
leads to knowledge of Self. Now, the announcement is *nanarupam*; it is
also *prithak*; and lastly, it is *viprasthitam* or contradictory, for,
as the commentator points out, that which a particular *asrama*
announces to be righteous is according to another unrighteous. Both the
vernacular translators give incorrect versions.

<span id="fn_964"></span>[336:2](m12b115.htm#fr_964.md) *Te* refers to
asramas. *Abhipretam* is *atma-tattwarupam*. *Yanti* is equivalent to
*prapayanti*.

<span id="fn_965"></span>[336:3](m12b115.htm#fr_965.md) *Mitranam* is taken
by the commentator to be equivalent to *sarva-bhuta-labhayapadanam*,
*i.e.*, they who have given the pledge of harmlessness to all creatures.
By enemies is meant here the envious and harmful.

<span id="fn_966"></span>[336:4](m12b115.htm#fr_966.md) In previous
Sections the nature of Truth has been discussed. A formal truth may be
as sinful as a lie, and a lie may be as meritorious as a Truth. Hence,
the ascertainment of Truth is not easy.

<span id="fn_967"></span>[336:5](m12b115.htm#fr_967.md) *Atiyoga* and
*Ayoga* are well-known words which have no chance of being misunderstood
<span id="page_337">p. 337</span> in the way in which they have been
misunderstood by both the vernacular translators. Indeed. K.P. Singha
blunders ridiculously, while the Burdwan translator limits them to only
the use of food, supposing the commentator's concrete examples exhaust
the meaning.

<span id="fn_968"></span>[337:1](m12b115.htm#fr_968.md) *i.e.*, where an
intermingling takes place of the four orders of men, *viz*., where
*Varna-sankara* occurs.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[337:2](m12b115.htm#fr_969.md) Mere companionship
with the righteous leads to righteous acts; while that with the sinful
leads to acts of sinfulness.

<span id="fn_970"></span>[338:1](m12b115.htm#fr_970.md) *Anuvishayam* is
*vishayam anu vartate*, *i.e.*, *rasah* or flavour. An eater of vighasa
is a good or pious man. What is said here is that such men eat for only
filling their stomachs and not because eating is source of enjoyment or
gratification. *Atmavishayan* is *Buddherviseshatovandhakan*, *i.e.*,
*rasa-viseshan*.

<span id="fn_971"></span>[338:2](m12b115.htm#fr_971.md) *Agamayamanam* is
*Agamam pramanajam jnanam atmana ichcchatam*.

<span id="fn_972"></span>[338:3](m12b115.htm#fr_972.md) *Akasasthah* is
*niralamvanah*, *i.e.*, men who have no foundations to stand upon. The
Bombay text reads *dosham*, the Bengal texts, *doshan*; the sense
remains unaltered. The Bombay reading is *atmapujabhikama*, while the
Bengal reading is the same word in the plural form. I accept the
singular form and take it as qualifying panditah.

<span id="fn_973"></span>[338:4](m12b115.htm#fr_973.md) Some of the Bengal
texts read *khattam*. The Bombay reading is *khatwam*. The commentator
explains that *khatwam samarudhah Tibra duhkha-grastah*. *Anusayi* means
*purvakarmavasanavan*. The sense seems to be this: the desires born of
one's past acts, *i.e.*, acts of previous lives, adhere to the mind.
Nothing can wipe them off, save *Nivritti* and *Tattwajnanam* or
knowledge of truth. One should, therefore, practise the religion of
*Nivritti* and seek to acquire knowledge of Truth.

<span id="fn_974"></span>[338:5](m12b115.htm#fr_974.md) Both the vernacular
translators quietly skip over the word *pratyanantarah*.

<span id="fn_975"></span>[338:6](m12b115.htm#fr_975.md) *i.e.*, where the
people are virtuous and given to the performance of their duties.
