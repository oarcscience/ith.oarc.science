### SECTION CCLXIII

"Jajali said, 'This course of duty that thou, O holder of scales,
preachest, closes the door of heaven against all creatures and puts a
stop to the very means of their subsistence. From agriculture comes
food. That food offers subsistence even to thee. With the aid of animals
and of crops and herbs, human beings, O trader, are enabled to support
their existence. From animals and food sacrifices flow. Thy doctrines
smack of atheism. This world will come to an end if the means by which
life is supported have to be abandoned.'

"Tuladhara said, 'I shall now speak on the object of the means of
sustenance. I am not, O Brahmana, an atheist. I do not blame Sacrifices.
The man, however, is very rare that is truly conversant with Sacrifice.
I bow to that Sacrifice which is ordained for Brahmanas. I bow also to
them that are conversant with that Sacrifice. Alas, the Brahmanas,
having given up the Sacrifice that is ordained for them, have betaken
themselves to the performance of Sacrifices that are for
Kshatriyas. <span id="fr_665"></span>[1](#fn_665.md) Many persons of faith,
O regenerate one, that are covetous and fond of wealth, without having
understood the true meaning of the declarations of the *Srutis*, and
proclaiming things that are really false but that have the show of
truth, have introduced many kinds of Sacrifices, saying, 'This should be
given away in this Sacrifice. This other thing should be given away in
this other Sacrifice. The first of this is very laudable.' The
consequence, however, of all this, O Jajali, is that theft and many evil
acts spring up. <span id="fr_666"></span>[2](#fn_666.md) It should be known
that only that sacrificial offering which was acquired by righteous
means can gratify the gods. There are abundant indications in the
scriptures that the worship of the deities may be accomplished with
vows, with libations poured on the fire, with recitations or chanting of
the Vedas, and with plants and herbs. From their religious acts
unrighteous persons get wicked offspring. From covetous men are born
children that are covetous, and from those that are contented spring
children that are contented. If the sacrificer and the priest suffer
themselves to be moved by desire of fruit (in respect of the Sacrifices
they perform or assist in), their children take the stain. If, on the
other hand, they do not yield to desire of fruit, the children born to
them become of the same kind. From Sacrifices spring progeny like clear
water from the firmament. The libations poured on the sacrificial fire
rise up to the Sun. From the Sun springs rain. From rain springs food.
From food are born living creatures. In former days, men righteously
devoted to Sacrifices used to obtain therefrom the fruition of all their
wishes. The earth yielded crops without tillage. The blessing uttered

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

by the *Rishis* produced herbs and plants. <span
id="fr_667"></span>[1](#fn_667.md) The men of former times never performed
Sacrifices from desire of fruits and never regarded themselves as called
upon to enjoy those fruits. Those who somehow perform sacrifices,
doubting the while their efficacy take birth in their next lives as
dishonest, wily, and greedy men exceedingly covetous of wealth. That man
who by the aid of false reasoning holds up all the authoritative
scriptures as fraught with evil, is certain to go, for such sinful act
of his, into the regions of the sinful. Such a man is certainly
possessed of a sinful soul, O foremost of Brahmanas, and always remains
here, bereft of wisdom. <span id="fr_668"></span>[2](#fn_668.md) That man
who regards those acts obligatory which have been laid down in the Vedas
and directed to be accomplished every day, who is penetrated with fear
if he fails to accomplish them any day, who takes all the essentials of
Sacrifice as identical with Brahma, and who never regards himself as the
actor, is truly a Brahmana. <span id="fr_669"></span>[3](#fn_669.md) If the
acts of such a person become incomplete, or if their completion be
obstructed by all unclean animals, even then those acts are, as heard by
us, of superior efficacy. If, however, those acts are done from desire
of fruit (and their completion be obstructed by such impediments), then
expiation would become necessary. They who covet the acquisition of the
highest object of life (*viz*., Emancipation), who are bereft of
cupidity in respect of all kinds of worldly wealth, who discard all
provision for the future, and who are freed from envy, betake themselves
to practice of truth and self-restraint as their Sacrifice. <span
id="fr_670"></span>[4](#fn_670.md) They that are conversant with the
distinction between body and soul, that are devoted to Yoga, and that
meditate on the *Pranava*, always

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

succeed in gratifying others. <span id="fr_671"></span>[1](#fn_671.md) The
universal Brahma (*viz*., *Pranava*), which is the soul of the deities,
dwells in him who is conversant with Brahma. When, therefore, such a man
eats and is gratified, all the deities, O Jajali, become gratified and
are contented. <span id="fr_672"></span>[2](#fn_672.md) As one who is
gratified with all kinds of taste feels no desire for any particular
taste, after the same manner one who is gratified with knowledge hath
everlasting gratification which to him is a source of perfect bliss.
Those wise men who are the refuge of righteousness and whose delight is
in righteousness, are persons that have certain knowledge of what is to
be done and what should not be done. One possessed of such wisdom always
regards all things in the universe to have sprung from his own
Self. <span id="fr_673"></span>[3](#fn_673.md) Some that are endued with
knowledge, that strive to reach the other shore (of this ocean of life),
and that are possessed of faith, succeed in attaining to the region of
Brahman, which is productive of great blessings, highly sacred, and
inhabited by righteous persons,--a region which is freed from sorrow,
whence there is no return, and where there is no kind of agitation or
pain. Such men do not covet heaven. They do not adore Brahma in costly
sacrifices. They walk along the path of the righteous. The Sacrifices
they perform are performed without injury to any creature. <span
id="fr_674"></span>[4](#fn_674.md) These men know trees and herbs and
fruits and roots as the only sacrificial offerings. Covetous priests,
for they are desirous of wealth, never officiate at the sacrifices of
these (poor) men. These regenerate men, although all their acts have
been completed, still perform sacrifices from desire of doing good to
all creatures and constituting their own selves as sacrificial
offerings. <span id="fr_675"></span>[5](#fn_675.md) For this reason,
grasping priests officiate at the Sacrifices of only those misguided
persons who, without endeavouring to attain to Emancipation, seek for
heaven. As regards those, however, that are really good, they always
seek, by accomplishing their own duties, to cause others to ascend to
heaven. Looking at both these kinds of behaviour, O Jajali, I have
(abstained from injuring any creature in the world and have) come to
regard all creatures with an equal heart. <span
id="fr_676"></span>[6](#fn_676.md) Endued with wisdom, many foremost of
Brahmanas perform Sacrifices (which with respect to their fruits are of
two kinds, for some of

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

them lead to Emancipation whence there is no return, and others lead to
regions of bliss whence there is return). By performing those
Sacrifices, they proceed, O great ascetic, along paths trodden by the
gods. Of one class of Sacrificers (*viz*., they who sacrifice from
desire of fruit) there is return (from the region which they reach). Of
those, however, that are truly wise (*viz*., those who sacrifice without
being urged thereto by desire of fruit), there is no return. Although
both classes of sacrificers, O Jajali, proceed along the path trodden by
the deities (in consequence of the sacrifices they perform), yet such is
the difference between their ultimate ends. <span
id="fr_677"></span>[1](#fn_677.md) In consequence of the success that
attends the purposes formed in the mind of such men, bulls, without
being forced thereto, willingly set their shoulders to the plough for
assisting at tillage and to the yoke for dragging their cars, and kine
pour forth milk from udders untouched by human hands. Creating
sacrificial stakes (and other necessaries of Sacrifice) by simple flats
of the will, they perform many kinds of Sacrifice well-completed with
abundant presents. <span id="fr_678"></span>[2](#fn_678.md) One who is of
such a cleansed soul may slaughter a cow (as an offering in
Sacrifice). <span id="fr_679"></span>[3](#fn_679.md) They, therefore, that
are not of that kind should perform Sacrifices with herbs and plants
(and not animals). Since Renunciation hath such merit, it is for that
reason that I have kept it before my eyes in speaking to thee. <span
id="fr_680"></span>[4](#fn_680.md) The gods know him for a Brahmana who has
given up all desire of fruit, who hath no exertion in respect of worldly
acts, who never bows down his head unto any one, who never utters the
praises of others, and who is endued with strength though his acts have
all been weakened. <span id="fr_681"></span>[5](#fn_681.md) What, O Jajali,
will be the end of him who doth not recite the Vedas, unto others, who
doth not perform Sacrifices (properly), who doth not make gifts unto
(deserving) Brahmanas, and who followeth an avocation in which every
kind of desire is indulged? By properly reverencing, however, the duties
that appertain to Renunciation, one is sure of attaining to
*Brahma*.' <span id="fr_682"></span>[6](#fn_682.md)

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

"Jajali said, 'We had never before, O son of a trader, heard of these
recondite doctrines of ascetics that perform only mental Sacrifices.
These doctrines are exceedingly difficult of comprehension. It is for
this reason that I ask thee (about them). The sages of olden days were
not followers of those doctrines of Yoga. Hence, the sages that have
succeeded them have not propounded them (for general acceptance). <span
id="fr_683"></span>[1](#fn_683.md) If thou sayest that only men of brutish
minds fail to achieve sacrifices in the soil of the Soul, then, O son of
a trader, by what acts would they succeed in accomplishing their
happiness? Tell me this, O thou of great wisdom! Great is my faith in
thy words.' <span id="fr_684"></span>[2](#fn_684.md)

"Tuladhara said, 'Sometimes sacrifices performed by some persons do not
become sacrifices (in consequence of the absence of faith of those that
perform them). These men, it should be said, are not worthy of
performing any sacrifice (internal or external). As regards the
faithful, however, only one thing, *viz*., the cow, is fit for upholding
all sacrifices by means of full libations of clarified butter, milk, and
curds, the hair at end of her tail, her horns, and her hoofs. <span
id="fr_685"></span>[3](#fn_685.md) (The Vedas declare that sacrifices
cannot be performed by an unmarried man). In performing sacrifices,
however, according to the mode I have pointed out (*viz*., by abstaining
from slaughter of animals and dedicating only clarified butter, etc.),
one may make Faith one's wedded wife, for dedicating such (innocent)
offerings to the deities. By duly reverencing such sacrifices, one is
sure to attain to *Brahma*. <span id="fr_686"></span>[4](#fn_686.md) To the
exclusion of all animals (which are certainly unclean as offering in
sacrifices), the rice-ball is a worthy offering in sacrifices. All
rivers are as sacred as the Saraswati, and all mountains are sacred. O
Jajali, the Soul is itself a *Tirtha*. Do not wander about on the earth
for visiting sacred places. A person, by observing these duties (that I
have spoken of and that do not involve injury to other

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

creatures), and by seeking the acquisition of merit agreeably to his own
ability, certainly succeeds in obtaining blessed regions
hereafter.' <span id="fr_687"></span>[1](#fn_687.md)

"Bhishma continued, 'These are the duties, O Yudhishthira, which
Tuladhara applauded,--duties that are consistent with reason, and that
are always observed by those that are good and wise.'"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_665"></span>[238:1](m12b090.htm#fr_665.md) The fact is, all
Sacrifices, in which injury is done to animal and vegetable life are
Sacrifices for Kshatriyas. The only Sacrifice that Brahmanas should
perform is *Yoga*.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[238:2](m12b090.htm#fr_666.md) Sacrifices are
always attractive for the fame they bring. Their performance depends
upon wealth. The acquisition of wealth leads to the commission of many
evil acts.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[239:1](m12b090.htm#fr_667.md) The sense is that
in former days when the true meaning of Sacrifice was understood and all
men performed them without being urged by the desire of fruit, the
beneficial consequences that flowed were the production of crops without
tillage (and without injury to animals that live in holes and burrows).
The good wishes the *Rishis* cherished for all creatures were sufficient
to produce herbs and plants and trees. May not this be taken as an
indication of the traditional idea of the happiness of Eden before the
fall of man?

<span id="fn_668"></span>[239:2](m12b090.htm#fr_668.md) 'Bereft of wisdom'
is explained by the commentator as implying the non-attainment of
emancipation.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[239:3](m12b090.htm#fr_669.md) This verse is
exceedingly terse and condensed. In the second line, the words *Brahmana
vartate loke*, literally rendered, mean 'who believes that only Brahma
exists in the world.' The commentator takes these words as implying 'who
regards every essential of Sacrifice as Brahma.' Although I have
followed the commentator, yet I think his interpretation to be rather
far-fetched. Why may not the words be taken in a literal sense? He who
takes *Brahma* to be all things and all things to be *Brahma*, becomes
sinless and deserves to be called a Brahmana. The last word of the
second tine simply means 'who does not regard his own self as the
actor.' The view expressed in the *Gita* is that we should do all acts
believing ourselves to be only agents or instruments of the Supreme
deity. Acts are His, we are only His tools. Such a conviction is sure to
guard us against all evil acts.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[239:4](m12b090.htm#fr_670.md) What is said in
verse 17 is that when Sacrifices are done from a sense of duty,
notwithstanding their incompleteness, they become efficacious. It is
only when they are performed from desire of fruit that expiation becomes
necessary if their completion be obstructed by any cause. Having thus
applauded the Sacrifices (represented by acts) of the truly wise, other
kinds of Sacrifices are indicated in verse 18. K.P. Singha translates 18
correctly. The Burdwan version is erroneous.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[240:1](m12b090.htm#fr_671.md) *Swayajna* is
literally 'sacrifice in one's own self'; hence, Yoga, *Brahmam vedam* is
*Pranava* or *Om*.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[240:2](m12b090.htm#fr_672.md) K.P. Singha
erroneously translates this verse. The Burdwan version, so far as it
goes, is correct. *Sarvam Brahma* is explained as *Pranava*, which is
*akhilam daivatam*, for the *Srutis* declare that *Omkarah
sarvadaivatyah*, *Brahmani* is *Brahmavidi*. What is intended to be said
in this verse is that when such a man eats and is gratified, the whole
universe becomes gratified. In the Vana Parvam, Krishna, by swallowing a
particle of pottage gratified the hunger of thousands of Durvasa's
pupils.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[240:3](m12b090.htm#fr_673.md) Such a man regards
all things as Brahma, and himself as Brahma.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[240:4](m12b090.htm#fr_674.md) K.P. Singha
blunders in rendering the second half of the first line. *Yasah*, the
commentator explains, is *Mahadyasah* or Brahma. 'The path of the
righteous,' the commentator thinks, is Yoga.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[240:5](m12b090.htm#fr_675.md) *i.e.*, they
perform mental Sacrifices.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[240:6](m12b090.htm#fr_676.md) 'For the reason,'
*i.e.*, because they cannot officiate at the Sacrifices of those that
are truly good. In the second line (28 is a triplet), the nominative
*sadhavah* is understood. The meaning is that such men, that is, the
truly good, accomplish their own duties not for benefiting their own
selves but for the good of others. What is said in the third line is
that <span id="page_241">p. 241</span> observing both kinds of
behaviour, *i.e.*, that of the good and that of the misguided, I follow
the path of the former by abstaining from every kind of injury.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[241:1](m12b090.htm#fr_677.md) *Yajneshu* is
'among Sacrifices.' *Yani* has reference to the different kinds of the
Sacrifices, *viz*., those performed from desire of fruit and
consequently productive of Return, and those not performed from desire
of fruit and consequently leading to Emancipation. *Tena* stands for
*tena Yajnena*. What the speaker wishes to lay down is that only a
certain class of sacrificers succeed in attaining to an end whence there
is no return.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[241:2](m12b090.htm#fr_678.md) The sense seems to
be that they perform mental Sacrifices, and not actual sacrifices after
having created by Yoga-power all the necessary articles.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[241:3](m12b090.htm#fr_679.md) The sin of
slaughtering a cow will not touch such a person, his soul being above
the influence of acts.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[241:4](m12b090.htm#fr_680.md) *i.e.*, I have for
this reason spoken in praise of Renunciation and not that frame of mind
in which one acts from desire of fruit.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[241:5](m12b090.htm#fr_681.md) These are, of
course, the indications of complete Renunciation. Such a man never bends
his head to another and never flatters another, for he is above all
want.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[241:6](m12b090.htm#fr_682.md) Verse 35 is a
triplet. In the first two lines the speaker says that one who does not
accomplish the acts specified, fails to attain to a desirable end. In
the last line, *idam*, refers to the duties of a true Brahmana or the
indications of the Renunciation as laid down in verse 34. *Daivatam
kritwa*, is explained by the commentator as *Daivatamiva sevaniyam
kritwa*, *Yajnam* is Vishnu or Brahma as the Srutis declare.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[242:1](m12b090.htm#fr_683.md) The Munis referred
to in the first line are those mentioned in verse 31 above. They are the
*atmayajins* or mental sacrificers. *Kashtam* is *gahanam*. *Asya* in
the second line refers to the particular *Yoga* of those Munis. Lest the
Yoga propounded by Tuladhara be regarded as altogether new, a
circumstance that would detract from their merit, the commentator
explains the words *natah* as preceded by *Avekshamana api* understood.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[242:2](m12b090.htm#fr_684.md) *Yasmin* here is
equivalent to *Yadi*, it being, as the commentator explains,
*Vibhaktipratirupakam avyayam*. *Eva* is equivalent to *Evam*, meaning
*Twaduktaprakarena*; *atmatirtha* means *atmaiva tirtham* or
*Yajnabhumistatra*. *Prapnuyat* in the second line stands for
*prapnuyuh*. The use of the singular for the plural is *arsha*.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[242:3](m12b090.htm#fr_685.md) What is said here
is this: the sacrifices of some men become lost through absence of
faith. These men, it is plain, are not worthy of performing any kind of
sacrifice internal or external. The performance of sacrifice, however,
is easy. The cow and her products can minister to all sacrifices. In the
case of those that are able, full libations of clarified butter, of
milk, and of curds, are sufficient to enable them to perform whatever
sacrifice they wish. As regards those that are poor, the dust of a cow's
hoof and the water in which a cow's tail and horns have been washed, are
quite sufficient to enable them to perform their sacrifices. *Purnahuti*
should not, I think, be taken as different from clarified butter, etc.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[242:4](m12b090.htm#fr_686.md) All these verses
are exceedingly terse. *Anena vidhina* is the mode which the speaker
himself advocates, *viz*., the performance of sacrifices without
slaughter of animals. *Niyojayan* is an instance *hetau satri*. After
*prakaroti* *Sraddham* is understood. *Ishtam* here means *Yagam*.
*Yajunam* (as in verse 35 above) is *Brahma*.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[243:1](m12b090.htm#fr_687.md) The soul is itself
a *tirtha*. A *tirtha*, of course, is a spot containing sacred water.
One should seek the acquisition of merit in the soul instead of going to
places called sacred and lying in different parts of the earth.
'According to his own ability' means 'according to the best of his
power.' If one can perform a sacrifice with clarified butter, one should
not do it with the dust of a cow's hoofs.
