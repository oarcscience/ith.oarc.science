### SECTION CCXL

"Vyasa said, 'O excellent son, asked by thee, I have told thee truly
what the answer to thy question should be according to the doctrine of
knowledge as expounded in the Sankhya system. Listen now to me as I
expound to thee all that should be done (for the same end) according to
the Yoga doctrine. The uniting together of Intellect and Mind, and all
the Senses, and the all-pervading Soul is said to be Knowledge of the
foremost kind. That Knowledge should be acquired (through the
preceptor's aid) by one that is of a tranquil disposition, that has
mastered his senses, that is capable (by meditation) of turning his gaze
on the Soul, that takes a pleasure in (such) meditation, that is endued
with intelligence and pure in acts. One should seek to acquire this
Knowledge by abandoning those five impediments of Yoga which are known
to the wise, *viz*., desire, wrath, cupidity, fear, and sleep. Wrath is
conquered by tranquillity of disposition. Desire is conquered by giving
up all purposes. By reflecting with the aid of the understanding upon
topics worthy of reflection, <span id="fr_467"></span>[1](#fn_467.md) one
endued with patience succeeds in abandoning sleep. By steady endurance
one should restrain one's organs of generation and the stomach (from
unworthy or sinful indulgence). One should protect one's hands and feet
by (using) one's eyes. One should protect one's eyes and ears by the aid
of one's mind, one's mind and speech by one's acts. One should avoid
fear by heedfulness, and pride by waiting upon the wise. Subduing
procrastination, one should, by these means, subdue these impediments of
Yoga. One should pay one's adorations to fire and the Brahmanas, and one
should bow one's head to the deities. One should avoid all kinds of
inauspicious discourse, and speech that is fraught with malice, and
words that are painful to other minds. *Brahma* is the effulgent seed
(of everything). It is, again, the essence of that seed whence is all
this. <span id="fr_468"></span>[2](#fn_468.md) *Brahma* became the eye, in
the form of this mobile and immobile universe, of all entities that took
birth. <span id="fr_469"></span>[3](#fn_469.md) Meditation, study, gift,
truth, modesty, simplicity, forgiveness, purity of body, purity of
conduct, subjugation of the senses, these enhance one's energy, which
(when enhanced) destroys one's sins. By behaving equally towards all
creatures and by living in contentment upon what is acquired easily and
without effort, one attains to the fruition of all one's objects and
succeeds in obtaining knowledge. Cleansed of all sins, endued with
energy, abstemious in diet, with senses under complete control, one
should, after having subdued both desire and wrath, seek to attain to
Brahma, <span id="fr_470"></span>[4](#fn_470.md) Firmly

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

uniting the senses and the mind (having drawn them away from all
external objects) with gaze fixed inwards, one should, in the still
hours of evening or in those before dawn, place one's mind upon the
knowledge. If even one of the five senses of a human being be kept
unrestrained, all his wisdom may be seen to escape through it like water
through an unstopped hole at the bottom of a leathern bag. The mind in
the first instance should be sought to be restrained by the Yogin after
the manner of a fisherman seeking at the outset to render that one among
the fish powerless from which there is the greatest danger to his nets.
Having first subdued the mind, the Yogin should then proceed to subdue
his ears, then his eyes, then his tongue, and then his nose. Having
restrained these, he should fix them on the mind. Then withdrawing the
mind from all purposes, he should fix it on the knowledge. Indeed,
having restrained the five senses, the Yati should fix them on the mind.
When these the mind for their sixth become concentrated in the
knowledge, and thus concentrated remain steady and untroubled, then
*Brahma* becomes perceptible like a smokeless fire of blazing flames or
the Sun of effulgent radiance. Indeed, one then beholds in oneself one's
soul like lightning fire in the skies. Everything then appears in it and
it appears in everything in consequence of its infinitude. Those
high-souled Brahmanas that are possessed of wisdom, that are endued with
fortitude, that are possessed of high knowledge, and that are engaged in
the good of all creatures, succeed in beholding it. Engaged in the
observance of austere vows, the Yogin who conducts himself thus for six
months, seated by himself on an isolated spot, succeeds in attaining to
an equality with the Indestructible. <span
id="fr_471"></span>[1](#fn_471.md) Annihilation, extension, power to
present varied aspects in the same person or body, celestial scents, and
sounds, and sights, the most agreeable sensations of taste and touch,
pleasurable sensations of coolness and warmth, equality with the wind,
capability of understanding (by inward light) the meaning of scriptures
and every work of genius, companionship of celestial damsels,--acquiring
all these by Yoga the Yogin should disregard them and merge them all in
the knowledge. <span id="fr_472"></span>[2](#fn_472.md) Restraining speech
and the senses one should practise Yoga during the hours after dusk, the
hours before dawn, and at dawn of day, seated on a mountain summit, or
at the foot of a goodly tree, or with a tree before him. <span
id="fr_473"></span>[3](#fn_473.md) Restraining all the senses within the
heart, one should, with

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

faculties concentrated, think on the Eternal and Indestructible like a
man of the world thinking of wealth and other valuable possessions. One
should never, while practising Yoga, withdraw one's mind from it. One
should with devotion betake oneself to those means by which one may
succeed in restraining the mind that is very restless. One should never
permit oneself to fall away from it. With the senses and the mind
withdrawn from everything else, the Yogin (for practice) should betake
himself to empty caves of mountains, to temples consecrated to the
deities, and to empty houses or apartments, for living there. One should
not associate with another in either speech, act, or thought.
Disregarding all things, and eating very abstemiously, the Yogin should
look with an equal eye upon objects acquired or lost. He should behave
after the same manner towards one that praises and one that censures
him. He should not seek the good or the evil of one or the other. He
should not rejoice at an acquisition or suffer anxiety when he meets
with failure or loss. Of uniform behaviour towards all beings, he should
imitate the wind. <span id="fr_474"></span>[1](#fn_474.md) Unto one whose
mind is thus turned to itself, who leads a life of purity, and who casts
an equal eye upon all things,--indeed, unto one who is ever engaged in
Yoga thus for even six months,--Brahma as represented by sound appears
very vividly. <span id="fr_475"></span>[2](#fn_475.md) Beholding all men
afflicted with anxiety (on account of earning wealth and comfort), the
Yogin should view a clod of earth, a piece of stone, and a lump of gold
with an equal eye. Indeed, he should withdraw himself from this path (of
earning wealth), cherishing an aversion for it, and never suffer himself
to be stupefied. Even if a person happens to belong to the inferior
order, even if one happens to be a woman, both of them, by following in
the track indicated above, will surely attain to the highest end. <span
id="fr_476"></span>[3](#fn_476.md) He that has subdued his mind beholds in
his own self, by the aid of his own knowledge the Uncreate, Ancient,
Undeteriorating, and Eternal Brahma,--That, *viz*., which can not be
attained to except by fixed senses,--That which is subtiler than the
most subtile, and grosser than the most gross, and which is
Emancipation's self.' <span id="fr_477"></span>[4](#fn_477.md)

"Bhishma continued, 'By ascertaining from the mouths of preceptors and
by themselves reflecting with their minds upon these words of the great
and

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

high-souled *Rishi* spoken so properly, persons possessed of wisdom
attain to that equality (about which the scriptures say) with Brahman
himself, till, indeed, the time when the universal dissolution comes
that swallows up all existent beings.'" <span
id="fr_478"></span>[1](#fn_478.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_467"></span>[182 :1](m12b067.htm#fr_467.md) Sattwena is
explained as 'by intelligence or the knowledge.'

<span id="fn_468"></span>[182 :2](m12b067.htm#fr_468.md) The construction,
as explained by the commentator, is *Brahma tejomayam sukram; yasya
sukrasya sarvam idam tasyapi Brahma rasah*. The last word means *sarah*.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[182 :3](m12b067.htm#fr_469.md) Both the
Vernacular translators have skipped over this line. The meaning is this:
Brahma opened his eyes for becoming many, as the *Srutis* declare, and
thereupon he became many. This, as the commentator explains,
*Ikshana-kartritvena sarvatmakatwam gatam*, or by a glance Brahma became
the Soul of all things mobile and immobile.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[182 :4](m12b067.htm#fr_470.md) The commentator
explains that *Brahmanah padam* means *prakritim*. He thinks, therefore,
<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>that the last clause of the second line
means 'should seek to subdue *prakriti* which is the *layasthanam* of
*mahattattwa*.' I prefer the obvious sense of the words.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[183:1](m12b067.htm#fr_471.md) *Parimitam Kalam*
is explained by the commentator as equivalent to six months as the
*srutis* declare.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[183:2](m12b067.htm#fr_472.md) These two verses
set forth the Yoga ideal. By the practice of Yoga all these are capable
of being acquired or attained. But then the Yogin who suffers himself to
be led away by those valuable possessions is said to fall in hell, for
the enjoyment of this kind is nothing but hell compared to the high
object for which Yogins should strive. Pramoha, Brahma, and Avarta, are
technical terms. Equality with the wind means speed of motion, power to
disappear at will, and capacity to move through the skies.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[183:3](m12b067.htm#fr_473.md) A *chaitya* is a
sacred or a large tree which stands firm on its roots and about which
all round a platform of earth is raised. *Vrikshagra* means 'in the
front of a tree,' probably implying 'under the shade of its spreading
branches.'

<span id="fn_474"></span>[184:1](m12b067.htm#fr_474.md) The commentator
explains that he should imitate the wind by becoming *asangah*, *i.e.*,
unattached to all things. *Aniketah* means without a house or fixed
abode.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[184:2](m12b067.htm#fr_475.md) It is difficult to
understand what is meant by *Savda-Brahmativartate*. I follow the
commentator. 'Brahma as represented by sound, is, of course, *Pranavah*
or *Om*, the mystic monosyllable standing for the trinity.' K.P. Singha,
taking *Savda-Brahma* for an accusative, regards it as implying,--'such
a man transcends all Vedic rites.' This is precisely the meaning
attached to it by the commentator where it occurs in verse 7 of section
236 *ante*.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[184:3](m12b067.htm#fr_476.md) The inferior order
here referred to is, of course, the Sudra order. The commentator points
out that whereas only the three superior orders axe regarded to be
eligible for the study of Sankhya and for inculcation of such *Srutis*
as Tattwamasi (That thou art), here Vyasa lays down that as regards the
Yoga path, *all* are eligible to betake themselves to it.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[184:4](m12b067.htm#fr_477.md) 'Fixed senses,'
*i.e.*, when the senses are fixed on the mind and the mind on the
understanding. *Ajaram* is immutable or unchanging, or that in which
there is no change for the worse (or for the better). By subtility is
indicated the incapacity of being apprehended, and by *mahattaram* is
meant infinity.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[185:1](m12b067.htm#fr_478.md) The *anu anudrisya*
is explained as *Guruvachanamanu*. Thus seems to be the true meaning,
otherwise *avekshya* would be pleonastic, *abhutagatim* is
*bhutasamplavaparyantam*, *i.e.*, till the destruction of all beings.
*Imam* is *sastraprasiddham*.
