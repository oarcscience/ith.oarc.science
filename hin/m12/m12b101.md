### SECTION CCLXXIV

"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast said, O grandsire, the Emancipation is to
be won by means and not otherwise. I desire to hear duly what those
means are.'

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

"Bhishma said, 'O thou of great wisdom, this enquiry that thou hast
addressed to me and that is connected with a subtle topic, is really
worthy of thee, since thou, O sinless one, always seekest to accomplish
all thy objects by the application of means. That state of mind which is
present when one sets oneself to make an earthen jar for
[one's](errata.htm#121.md) use, disappears after the jar has been
completed. After the same manner, that cause which urges persons who
regard virtue as the root of advancement and prosperity ceases to
operate with them that seek to achieve Emancipation. <span
id="fr_800"></span>[1](#fn_800.md) That path which leads to the Eastern
Ocean is not the path by which one can go to the Western Ocean. There is
only one path that leads to Emancipation. (It is not identical with any
of those that lead to any other object of acquisition). Listen to me as
I discourse on it to thee in detail. One should, by practising
forgiveness, exterminate wrath, and by abandoning--all purposes, root
out desire. By practising the quality of *Sattwa* <span
id="fr_801"></span>[2](#fn_801.md) one should conquer sleep. By heedfulness
one should keep off fear, and by contemplation of the Soul one should
conquer breath. <span id="fr_802"></span>[3](#fn_802.md) Desire, aversion,
and lust, one should dispel by patience; error, ignorance, and doubt, by
study of truth. By pursuit after knowledge one should avoid
*insouciance* and inquiry after things of no interest. <span
id="fr_803"></span>[4](#fn_803.md) By frugal and easily digestible fare one
should drive off all disorders and diseases. By contentment one should
dispel greed and stupefaction of judgment, and all worldly concerns
should be avoided by a knowledge of the truth. <span
id="fr_804"></span>[5](#fn_804.md) By practising benevolence one should
conquer iniquity, and by regard for all creatures one should acquire
virtue. One should avoid expectation by the reflection that it is
concerned with the future; and one should cast off wealth by abandoning
desire itself. The man of intelligence should abandon affection by
recollecting that everything (here) is transitory. He should subdue
hunger by practising Yoga. By practising benevolence one should keep off
all ideas of self-importance, and drive off all sorts of craving by
adopting contentment. By exertion one should subdue procrastination, and
by certainty all kinds of doubt, by taciturnity, loquaciousness, and by
courage, every kind of fear. <span id="fr_805"></span>[6](#fn_805.md)
Speech and mind are to be subdued by the Understanding,

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

and the Understanding, in its turn, is to be kept under control by the
eye of knowledge. Knowledge, again, is to be controlled by acquaintance
with the Soul, and finally the Soul is to be controlled by the
Soul. <span id="fr_806"></span>[1](#fn_806.md) This last is attainable by
those that are of pure-acts and endued with tranquillity of soul, <span
id="fr_807"></span>[2](#fn_807.md) the means being the subjugation of those
five impediments of Yoga of which the learned speak. By casting off
desire and wrath and covetousness and fear and sleep, one should,
restraining speech, practise what is favourable to Yoga, *viz*.,
contemplation, study, gift, truth, modesty, candour, forgiveness, purity
of heart, purity in respect of food, and the subjugation of the senses.
By these one's energy is increased, sins are dispelled, wishes crowned
with fruition, and knowledge (of diverse kinds) gained. When one becomes
cleansed of one's sins and possessed of energy and frugal of fare and
the master of one's senses, one then, having conquered both desire and
wrath, seeks to attain to *Brahma*. The avoidance of ignorance (by
listening to and studying the scriptures), the absence of attachment (in
consequence of Renunciation) freedom from desire and wrath (by adoption
of contentment and forgiveness), the puissance that is won by Yoga, the
absence of pride and haughtiness, freedom from anxiety (by subjugation
of every kind of fear), absence of attachment of anything like home and
family,--these constitute the path of Emancipation. That path is
delightful, stainless, and pure. Similarly, the restraining of speech,
of body, and of mind, when practised from the absence of desire,
constitutes also the path of Emancipation.'" <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_800"></span>[280:1](m12b101.htm#fr_800.md) What is said in
this verse is this: when a man wants an earthen jar, he works for
creating one. When he has got one, he no longer finds himself in the
same state of mind, his want having been satisfied. Similarly, with men
desirous of heaven and earthly prosperity as the reward of virtue, the
means is *Pravritti* or acts. This or these cease to operate with those
who having acquired such virtue set themselves for the achievement of
Emancipation, for with them the religion of *Nivritti* is all in all.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[280:2](m12b101.htm#fr_801.md) *i.e.*, by
abandoning all kinds of idleness, as explained by the commentator.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[280:3](m12b101.htm#fr_802.md) *i.e.*, by
Yoga-meditation one should regulate and finally suspend one's breath.
The Yogin can suspend all physical functions and yet live on from age to
age.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[280:4](m12b101.htm#fr_803.md) *Nidra* here is
explained as *ananusandhana* or the absence of inquisitiveness or
curiosity. By *pratibha* is meant inquiry after improper things or
things that are of no interest.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[280:5](m12b101.htm#fr_804.md) The truth is that
the world is unreal and has no end.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[280:6](m12b101.htm#fr_805.md) Hunger is to be
subdued by Yoga, *i.e.*, by regulating the wind within the body. Doubt
is to be dispelled by certainty; this implies that certain knowledge
should be sought for by driving off doubt. The commentator thinks that
this means that all sceptical conclusions should be dispelled by faith
in the scriptures. By 'fear,' in this verse, is meant the source <span
id="page_281">p. 281</span> of fear, or the world. That is to be
conquered by the conquest of the six, *i.e.*, desire, wrath,
covetousness, error, pride, and envy.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[281:1](m12b101.htm#fr_806.md) What is laid down
here is the same course of training that is indicated for Yoga. First,
the senses are to be merged into the mind, then the mind is to be merged
into the Understanding, then the Understanding is to be merged into the
Soul or what is known as the Ego. This Ego is to be merged at last into
the Supreme Soul. When the Ego is understood, it comes to be viewed as
*Brahma*.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[281:2](m12b101.htm#fr_807.md) 'Pure acts' are, of
course, those that are included in 'Nishkama dharmah,' and 'tranquillity
of soul' is the cleansing of the soul by driving away all passions and
desires.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[281:3](m12b101.htm#fr_808.md) Such restraint of
speech, etc., or *niyamah* is *yogah*. *Kamaoanyatha* is
*kama-vaiparityena*. The sense, the commentator adds, is that one should
not desire 'yoga-siddhi,' for then, as has been repeatedly indicated in
the previous Sections, the Yogin would fall into hell and succeed not in
attaining to Emancipation, heaven itself being hell in comparison with
the felicity of Emancipation. K.P. Singha quietly skips over the last
line and the Burdwan translator offers a ridiculously incorrect version.
