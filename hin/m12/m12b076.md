### SECTION CCXLIX

"Vyasa said, 'The objects by which one is surrounded are created by the
understanding. The Soul, without being connected with them, stands
aloof, presiding over them. It is the understanding that creates all
objects. The three primary qualities are continually being transformed
(for the production of objects). The Kshetrajna or Soul, endued with
puissance, presides, over them all, without, however, mingling with
them. <span id="fr_557"></span>[1](#fn_557.md) The objects which the
understanding creates partake of its own nature. Indeed, as the spider
creates threads (which partakes of its own material substance), the
objects created by the understanding partake of the nature of the
understanding. Some maintain that the qualities, when driven away by
Yoga or knowledge, do not cease to exist. They say this because when
once gone, the indications only of their return are not perceptible.
(But that is no evidence of their actual destruction). Others say that
when dispelled by knowledge, they are at once destroyed never to
return. <span id="fr_558"></span>[2](#fn_558.md) Reflecting upon these two
opinions properly, one should strive one's best according to the way one
thinks proper. It is by this way that one should attain to eminence and
take refuge in one's own Soul alone. <span
id="fr_559"></span>[3](#fn_559.md) The Soul is without beginning and
without end. Comprehending his Soul properly man should move and act,
without giving way to wrath, without indulging in joy, and always free
from envy. Cutting by this means the knot that is in one's heart, the
knot whose existence is due to the operation of the faculties of the
understanding, which is hard (to open or cut), but which nevertheless is
capable of being destroyed by knowledge, one should live happily,
without giving way to grief (for anything that happens), and with one's
doubts dispelled. Know that they who mingle in the affairs of this world
are as distressed in body and mind as persons ignorant of the art of
swimming

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

when they slip from the land and fall into a large and deep river. The
man of learning, however, being conversant with the truth, is never
distressed, for he feels like one walking over solid land. Indeed, he
who apprehends his Soul to be such, *viz*., as presenting only the
character of *Chit* which has knowledge alone for its indication, is
never distressed. Indeed, a person, by thus comprehending the origin and
end of all creatures, and by thus apprehending their inequalities or
distinctions, succeeds in attaining to high felicity. This knowledge is
the possession of a Brahmana in especial by virtue of his birth.
Knowledge of the Soul, and felicity like that which has been adverted
to, are each fully sufficient to lead to emancipation. <span
id="fr_560"></span>[1](#fn_560.md) By acquiring such knowledge one really
becomes learned. What else is the indication of a person of knowledge?
Having acquired such knowledge, they that are wise among men regard
themselves crowned with success and become emancipated. <span
id="fr_561"></span>[2](#fn_561.md) Those things that become sources of fear
unto men destitute of knowledge do not become sources of fear unto those
that are endued with knowledge. There is no end higher than the eternal
end which is obtained by a person possessed of knowledge. One beholds
with aversion all earthly objects of enjoyment which are, of course,
fraught with faults of every kind. Another, beholding others betake
themselves with pleasure to such objects, is filled with sorrow. As
regards this matter, however, they that are conversant with both
objects, behold, *viz*., that which is fictitious and that which is not
so, never indulge in sorrow and are truly happy. <span
id="fr_562"></span>[3](#fn_562.md) That which a man does without
expectation of fruits destroys his acts of a former life. The acts,
however, of such a person both of this and his previous life cannot lead
to Emancipation. On the other hand, such destruction of former acts and
such acts of this life cannot lead to what is disagreeable (*viz*.,
hell), even if the man of wisdom engages in acts.'" <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_557"></span>[207:1](m12b076.htm#fr_557.md) *Gunan* in the
first line means *Vishayan*, in the second line it means *Sattivadin*,
*Vikriyatah* is *vikram bhajamanan*. How the understanding creates
objects has been explained in previous sections.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[207:2](m12b076.htm#fr_558.md) *Na nivartante* is
explained by the commentator as *na ghatadivat nasyanti kintu
rajjuragadiva badha eva*, etc., and he concludes by saying that
according to this theory *niranvayanasa eva gunanam*, or, in other
words, that the Gunas are not so destroyed by knowledge that they do not
return.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[207:3](m12b076.htm#fr_559.md) According to the
speaker then, there is not much practical difference between the two
opinions here adverted to, and one's course of conduct will not be much
affected by either of the theories that one may, after reflection,
adopt.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[208:1](m12b076.htm#fr_560.md) *Janmasamartham* is
explained as certain to be acquired by virtue of birth or of the
practice of the duties laid down for one's own order. *Parayanam* is
*moksha-prapakam*.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[208:2](m12b076.htm#fr_561.md) The Bengal reading
*buddhah* is preferable to the Bombay reading *Suddhah* which would be
pleonastic in view of what follows in the second line.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[208:3](m12b076.htm#fr_562.md) *Lokam* is
explained as *lokyate iti lokah*, *i.e.*, objects of enjoyment such as
wife, etc., *aturam*, is afflicted with faults or defects. *Ubhayam
kritakritam* is as the commentator explains, *sokasokarupam* or
*aropitam* and *anaropitam*.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[208:4](m12b076.htm#fr_563.md) Many of the verses
of this and the previous section correspond with those of section 194
*ante*. Many verbal changes, however, are noticeable. In consequences of
those changes, the meaning sometimes becomes lightly and sometimes
materially different.
