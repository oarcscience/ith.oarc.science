### SECTION CCXLVI

"Vyasa said, 'The *Jiva*-soul is endued with all those entities that are
modifications of Prakriti. These do not know the Soul but the Soul knows
them all. Like a good driver proceeding with the aid of strong,
well-broken, and high-mettled steeds along the paths he selects, the
Soul acts with the aid of these, called the senses, having the mind for
their sixth. The objects of the senses are superior to the senses
themselves. The mind is superior to those objects. The understanding is
superior to the mind. The Soul, also called Mahat, is superior to the
understanding. Superior to *Mahat* is the Unmanifest (or Prakriti).
Superior to the Unmanifest is *Brahma*. There is nothing Superior to
*Brahma*. That is the highest limit of excellence and the highest goal.
The Supreme Soul is concealed in every creature. It is not displayed for
ordinary men to behold. Only Yogins with subtile vision behold the
Supreme Soul with the aid of their keen and subtile understanding.
Merging the senses having the mind for their sixth and all the objects
of the senses into the inner Soul by the aid of the Understanding, and
reflecting upon the three states of consciousness, *viz*., the object
thought, the act of thinking, and the thinker, and abstaining by
contemplation from every kind of enjoyment, equipping his mind with the
knowledge that he is *Brahma's* self, laying aside at the same time all
consciousness of puissance, and thereby making his soul perfectly
tranquil, the Yogin obtains that to which immortality inheres. That
person, however, who happens to be the slave of all his senses and whose
ideas of right and wrong have been confounded, already liable as he is
to death, actually meets with death by such surrender of self to (the
passions). <span id="fr_536"></span>[1](#fn_536.md) Destroying

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

all desires, one should merge the gross Understanding into one's subtile
Understanding. Having thus merged the gross into the subtile
Understanding, one is sure to become a second Kalanjara mountain. <span
id="fr_537"></span>[1](#fn_537.md) By purifying his heart, the Yogin
transcends both righteousness and its reverse. By purifying his heart
and by living in his own true nature, he attains to the highest
happiness. <span id="fr_538"></span>[2](#fn_538.md) The indication of that
purity of heart (of which I speak) is that one who has attained to
experiences that state of unconsciousness (with respect of all one's
surroundings) which one experiences in dreamless slumber. The Yogin who
has attained to that state lives like the steady flame of a lamp that
burns in a place where the atmosphere is perfectly still. Becoming
abstemious in diet, and having cleansed his heart, that Yogin who
applies his Soul to the Soul succeeds in beholding the Soul in the
Soul. <span id="fr_539"></span>[3](#fn_539.md) This discourse, O son,
intended for thy instruction, is the essence of all the Vedas. The
truths herein disclosed are incapable of being understood by the aid of
inference alone or by that of mere study of the scriptures. One must
understand it oneself by the aid of faith. By churning the wealth that
is contained in all religious works and in all discourses based on
truth, as also the ten thousand *Richs*, this nectar hath been raised.
As butter from curds and fire from wood, even hath this been raised for
the sake of my son,--this that constituteth the knowledge of all truly
wise men. This discourse, O son, fraught with solid instruction, is
intended for delivery unto *Snatakas*. <span
id="fr_540"></span>[4](#fn_540.md) It should never be imparted to one that
is not of tranquil soul, or one that is not self-restrained, or one that
hath not undergone penances. It should not be communicated to one that
is not conversant with the Vedas, or one that doth not humbly wait upon
one's preceptor, or one that is not free from malice, or one that is not
possessed of sincerity and candour, or one that is of reckless
behaviour. It should never be communicated to one whose intellect hath
been consumed by the science of disputation, or one that is vile or low.
Unto that person, however, who is possessed of fame, or who deserveth
applause (for his virtues), or who is of tranquil soul, or possessed of
ascetic merit, unto a Brahmana who is such, unto one's son or dutiful
disciple, this discourse containing the

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

very essence of duties should be communicated, but on no account should
it be communicated to others. If any person makes a gift of the whole
earth with all her treasures, unto one conversant with truth, the latter
would still regard the gift of this knowledge to be very much superior
to that gift. I shall now discourse to thee on a subject that is a
greater mystery than this, a subject that is connected with the Soul,
that transcends the ordinary understandings of human beings, that has
been beheld by the foremost of *Rishis*, that has been treated in the
Upanishads, and that forms the topic of thy inquiry. Tell me what, after
this is in thy mind? Tell me in what thou has still any doubt? Listen,
for here I am, O son, faces turned towards all directions. The Sun and
the Moon are thy two seated before thee! Upon what indeed, shall I once
more speak to thee?'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_536"></span>[200:1](m12b073.htm#fr_536.md) *Smriti* is memory.
One whose *smriti*, is lost means one whose conceptions of right and
wrong are confounded. *Atmanah sampradanena* is 'by the surrender of
oneself' to one's own passions or *Kamadibhyah* as the commentator
explains.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[201:1](m12b073.htm#fr_537.md) *Chittam* is
explained by the commentator as the gross understanding, and *Sattwa* as
the subtile understanding.. The understanding that is concerned with the
images brought by the mind or the senses is called gross; while that
which is concerned with ideas about *Brahma* is called subtile.
*Kalanjara* is explained by the commentator either as standing for the
mountain of that name, *i.e.*, irremovable as the mountain so called;
or, as one who destroys the effect of Time, *i.e.*, one who subdues Time
instead of being subdued by that universal conqueror.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[201:2](m12b073.htm#fr_538.md) The purification
here referred to consists in transcending the consciousness of duality.
Righteousness should be avoided because of its incapacity to lead to
Emancipation which is much higher than heaven. *Atmani sthitwa* means
living in one's real or true nature, *i.e.*, merging everything into the
Soul. This is attained when the consciousness of duality is transcended.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[201:3](m12b073.htm#fr_539.md) *Atmanam* in the
first line is the Jiva-soul, and *atmani* is the Supreme Soul. In the
second line also, the same distinction is observed between the two
words.

<span id="fn_540"></span>[201:4](m12b073.htm#fr_540.md) Brahmanas, who
having completed the study of the Vedas have betaken themselves to the
domestic mode of life, are so called. Here, probably, the reference is
to persons having faith in the Vedas and of pure conduct.
