### SECTION CVII

"Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast, O scorcher of foes, described the course
of duties, the general conduct, the means of livelihood, with their
results, of Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras. Thou hast
discoursed also on the duties of kings, the subject of their treasuries,
the means of filling them, and the topic of conquest and victory. Thou
hast spoken also of the characteristics of ministers, the measures, that
lead to the advancement of the subjects, the characteristics of the
sixfold limbs of a kingdom, the qualities of armies, the means of
distinguishing the wicked, and the marks of those that are good, the
attributes of those that are equal, those that are inferior, and those
that are superior, the behaviour which a king desirous of advancement
should adopt towards the masses, and the manner in which the weak should
be protected and cherished. Thou hast discoursed on all these subjects,
O Bharata, laying down instructions that are plain according to what has
been inculcated hi sacred treatise. Thou hast spoken also of the
behaviour that should be adopted by kings desirous of conquering their
foes. I desire now, O foremost of intelligent men, to listen to the
behaviour that one should observe towards the multitude of courageous
men that assemble round a king! <span id="fr_326"></span>[1](#fn_326.md) I
desire to hear how these may grow, how they may be attached to the king,
O Bharata, how may they succeed in subjugating their foes and in
acquiring friends. It seems to me that disunion alone can bring about
their destruction. I think it is always difficult to keep counsels
secret when many are concerned. I desire to hear all this in detail, O
scorcher of foes! Tell me also, O king, the means by which they may be
prevented from falling out with the king.'

"Bhishma said, 'Between the aristocracy on the one side and the kings on
the other, avarice and wrath, O monarch, are the causes that produce
enmity. <span id="fr_327"></span>[2](#fn_327.md) One of these parties
(*viz*., the king,) yields to avarice. As a consequence, wrath takes
possession of the other (the aristocracy). Each intent upon weakening
and wasting the other, they both meet with destruction. By employing
spies, contrivances of policy, and physical force, and adopting the arts
of conciliation, gifts, and disunion and applying other methods for
producing weakness, waste, and fear, the parties assail each other. The
aristocracy of a kingdom, having the characteristics of a compact body,
become dissociated from

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

the king if the latter seeks to take too much from them. Dissociated
from the king, all of them become dissatisfied, and acting from fear,
side with the enemies of their ruler. If again the aristocracy of a
kingdom be disunited amongst themselves, they meet with destruction.
Disunited, they fall an easy prey to foes. The nobles, therefore, should
always act in concert. If they be united together, they may earn
acquisitions of value by means of their strength and prowess. Indeed,
when they are thus united, many outsiders seek their alliance. Men of
knowledge applaud those nobles that art united with one another in bonds
of love. If united in purpose, all of them can be happy. They can (by
their example) establish righteous courses of conduct. By behaving
properly, they advance in prosperity. By restraining their sons and
brothers and teaching them their duties, and by behaving kindly towards
all persons whose pride has been quelled by knowledge, <span
id="fr_328"></span>[1](#fn_328.md) the aristocracy advance in prosperity.
By always attending to the duties of setting spies and devising means of
policy, as also to the matter of filling their treasuries, the
aristocracy, O thou of mighty arms, advance in prosperity. By showing
proper reverence for them that are possessed of wisdom and courage and
perseverance and that display steady prowess in all kinds of work, the
aristocracy advance in prosperity. Possessed of wealth and resources, of
knowledge of the scriptures and all arts and sciences, the aristocracy
rescue the ignorant masses from every kind of distress and danger. Wrath
(on the of part the king), rupture, <span
id="fr_329"></span>[2](#fn_329.md) terror, chastisement, persecution,
oppression, and executions, O chief of the Bharatas, speedily cause the
aristocracy to fall away from the king and side with the king's enemies.
They, therefore, that are the leaders of the aristocracy should be
honoured by the king. The affairs of the kingdom, O king, depend to a
great extent upon them. Consultations should be held with only those
that are the leaders of the aristocracy, and secret agents should be
placed, O crusher of foes, with them only. The king should not, O
Bharata, consult with every member of the aristocracy. The king, acting
in concert with the leaders, should do what is for the good of the whole
order. When, however, the aristocracy becomes separated and disunited
and destitute of leaders, other courses of action should be followed. If
the members of the aristocracy quarrel with one another and act, each
according to his own resources, without combination, their prosperity
dwindles away and diverse kinds of evil occur. Those amongst them that
are possessed of learning and wisdom should tread down a dispute as soon
as it happens. Indeed, if the seniors of a race look on with
indifference, quarrels break out amongst the members. Such quarrels
bring about the destruction of a race and produce disunion among the
(entire order of the) nobles. Protect thyself, O king, from all fears
that arise from within. Fears, however, that arise from outside are of
little consequence. The first kind of fear, O king, may cut thy roots in
a single day. Persons that are equal to one another in family and blood,
influenced by wrath or folly or covetousness arising from their very

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

natures, cease to speak with one another. This is an indication of
defeat. It is not by courage, nor by intelligence, nor by beauty, nor by
wealth, that enemies succeed in destroying the aristocracy. It is only
by disunion and gifts that it can be reduced to subjugation. For this
reason, combination has been said to be the great refuge of the
aristocracy.'" <span id="fr_330"></span>[1](#fn_330.md)

<span id="fn_326"></span>[233:1](m12a106.htm#fr_326.md) The word is *Gana*.
it literally means an assemblage. There can be no doubt that throughout
this lesson the word has been employed to denote the aristocracy of
wealth and blood that surround a throne.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[233:2](m12a106.htm#fr_327.md) If the king, moved
by avarice, taxes them heavily, the aristocracy resent it and seek to
pull down the king.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[234:1](m12a106.htm#fr_328.md) *i.e.*, learned men
of humility.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[234:2](m12a106.htm#fr_329.md) Probably, with the
king.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[235:1](m12a106.htm#fr_330.md) The Burdwan Pundits
make a mess of the last two verses. In 31, there is an incorrect reading
in the Bengal texts. It is *Pradhanaccha* for *pradanaccha*. The Burdwan
version repeats the error. K.P. Singha, of course, avoids it, but his
version is rather incomplete.
