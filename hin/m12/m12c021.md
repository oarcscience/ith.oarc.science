### SECTION CCCXXII

"Yudhishthira said, 'How was Suka, the son of Vyasa, in days of old, won
over to Renunciation? I desire to hear thee recite the story. My
curiosity in this respect is irrepressible. It behoveth thee, O thou of
Kuru's race, to discourse to me on the conclusions in respect of the
Unmanifest (Cause), the Manifest (Effects), and of the Truth (or Brahma)
that is in, but unattached to them, as also of the acts of the self-born
Narayana, as they are known to thy understanding.

"Bhishma said, 'Beholding his son Suka living fearlessly as ordinary men
do in practices that are considered harmless by them, Vyasa taught him
the entire Vedas and then discoursed to him one day in these words:
'Vyasa said, O son, becoming the master of the senses, do thou subdue
extreme cold and extreme heat, hunger and thirst, and the wind also, and
having subdued them (as Yogins do), do thou practise righteousness.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Do thou duly observe truth and sincerity, and
freedom from wrath and malice, and self-restraint and penances, and the
duties of benevolence and compassion. Rest thou on truth, firmly devoted
to righteousness, abandoning all sort of insincerity and deceit. Do thou
support thy life on what remains of food after feeding gods and guests.
Thy body is as transitory as the froth on the surface of water. The
Jiva-soul is sitting unattached in it as a bird on a tree. The
companionship of all agreeable object is exceedingly short-lived. Why
then, O son, dost thou sleep in such forgetfulness? Thy foes are heedful
and awake and ever ready (to spring on thee) and always watchful of
their opportunity. Why art thou so foolish as not to know this? <span
id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_127.md) As the days are going one after another,
the period of thy life is being lessened. Indeed when thy life is being
incessantly shortened, why dost thou not run to preceptors (for learning
the means of rescue)? Only they that are destitute of faith (in the
existence of next life) set their hearts on things of this world that
have the only effect of increasing flesh and blood. They are totally
unmindful of all that is concerned with the next world. Those men that
are stupefied by erroneous understandings display a hatred for
righteousness. The man who walks after those misguided persons that have
betaken themselves to devious and wrong paths is afflicted equally with
them. They however, that are contented, devoted to the scriptures,
endued with high souls, and possessed of great might, betake themselves
to the part of righteousness. Do thou wait upon them with reverence and
seek instruction from them. Do thou act according to the instructions
received from those wise men whose eyes are set upon righteousness. With
understanding cleansed by such lessons and rendered superior, do thou
then restrain thy heart which is ever ready to deviate from the right
course. They whose understandings are always concerned with the present,
who fearlessly regard the tomorrow as something quite remote,--they who
do not observe any restrictions in the matter of food,--ate really
senseless persons that fail to understand that this world is only a
field of probation. <span id="fr_128"></span>[2](#fn_128.md) Repairing to
the fight of steps constituted by Righteousness, do thou ascend those
steps one after another. At present thou art like a worm that is
employed in weaving its cocoon round itself and thereby depriving itself
of all means of escape. Do thou keep to thy left, without any scruple,
the atheist who transgresses all restraints, who is situated like a
house by the side of a fierce and encroaching current, (for the
destruction he courts), and who (to others) seems to stand like a bamboo
with its tall head erected in

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

pride. <span id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_129.md) Do thou with the raft of
Yoga, cross the ocean of the world whose waters are constituted by thy
five senses. Having Desire and Wrath and Death for its fierce monsters,
and owning birth for its vortex. Do thou cross, with the raft of
Righteousness, the world that is affected by Death and afflicted by
Decrepitude, and upon which the thunder-bolts constituted by days and
nights are falling incessantly. When death is seeking thee at all
moments, *viz*., when thou art sitting or lying down, it is certain that
Death may get thee for his victim at any time. Whence art thou to obtain
thy rescue! Like the she-wolf snatching away a lamb. Death snatches away
one that is still engaged in earning wealth and still unsatisfied in the
indulgence of his pleasures. When thou art destined to enter into the
dark, do thou hold up the blazing lamp made of righteous understanding
and whose flame has been well-husbanded out. Failing into various forms
one after another in the world of men, a creature obtains the status of
Brahmanhood with great difficulty. Thou hast obtained that status. Do
thou then, O son endeavour to maintain it (properly). <span
id="fr_130"></span>[2](#fn_130.md) A Brahman hath not been born for the
gratification of desire. On the other hand, his body is intended to be
subjected to mortification and penances in this world so that
incomparable happiness may be his in the next world. The status of
Brahmanhood is acquired with the aid of long-continued and austere
penances. Having acquired that status, one should never waste one's time
in the indulgence of one's senses. Always engaged in penances and
self-restraint and desirous of what is for thy good, do thou live and
act, devoted to peace and tranquillity. The period of life, of every
man, is like a steed. The nature of that steed is unmanifest. The
(sixteen) elements (mentioned before) constitute its body. Its nature is
exceedingly subtile. Kshanas, and Trutis, and Nimeshas are the hair on
its body. The twilights constitute its shoulder joints; The lighted and
the dark fortnights are its two eyes of equal power. Months are its
other limbs. That steed is running incessantly. If thy eyes be not
blind, beholding then that steed incessantly moving forward in its
invisible course, do thou set thy heart on righteousness, after hearing
what thy preceptors have to say on the question of the next world. They
that fall away from righteousness and that conduct themselves
recklessly, that always display malice towards others and betake
themselves to evil ways are obliged to assume (physical) bodies in the
regions of Yama and suffer diverse afflictions, in consequence of their
unrighteous acts of diverse

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

kind. <span id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_131.md) That king who is devoted to
righteousness and who protects and chastises the good and the wicked
with discrimination, attains to those regions that belong to man of
righteous deeds. By doing diverse kinds of good acts, he attains to such
felicity as is faultless and as is incapable of being attained to by
undergoing even thousands of births. <span
id="fr_132"></span>[2](#fn_132.md) Furious dogs of frightful mien, crows of
iron beaks, flocks of ravens and vultures and other birds, and
blood-sucking worms, assail the man who transgresses the commands of his
parents and preceptors when he goes to hell after death. <span
id="fr_133"></span>[3](#fn_133.md) That sinful wretch who, in consequence
of his recklessness, transgresses the ten boundaries that have been
fixed by the Self-born himself, is obliged to pass his time in great
affliction in the wild wastes that occur in the dominions of the king of
Pitris. <span id="fr_134"></span>[4](#fn_134.md) That man who is tainted
with cupidity, who is in love with untruth, who always takes a delight
in deception and cheating, and who does injuries to others by practising
hypocrisy and deception, has to go to deep hell and suffer great woe and
affliction for his acts of wickedness. Such a man is forced to bathe in
the broad river called Vaitarani whose waters are scalding, to enter
into a forest of trees whose leaves are as sharp as swords, and then to
lie down on a bed of battle-axes. He has thus to pass his days in
frightful hell in great affliction. Thou beholdest only the regions of
Brahman and other deities, but thou art blind to that which is the
highest (*viz*., Emancipation). Alas, thou art ever blind also to that
which brings Death on its train (*viz*., decrepitude and old age). <span
id="fr_135"></span>[5](#fn_135) Go (along the path of Emancipation.md)! Why
tarriest thou? A frightful terror, destructive of thy happiness, is
before thee! Do thou take prompt steps for achieving thy Emancipation!
Soon after death thou art sure to be taken before Yama at his command.
For obtaining felicity in the next world, strive to attain to
righteousness through the practice of difficult and austere vows. The
puissant Yama, regardless of the sufferings of others, very soon takes
the lives of all persons, that is of thyself and thy friends. There is
none capable of resisting him. Very soon the wind of Yama will blow
before thee (and drive thee to his presence). Very soon wilt thou be
taken to that dread presence all alone. Do thou achieve what will be for
thy good there. Where now is that Death-wind which will blow before

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

thee very soon? (Art thou mindful of it?) Very soon will the points of
the compass, when that moment arrives, begin to whirl before thy eyes.
(Art thou mindful of that?) O son, soon (when that moment comes) will
thy Vedas disappear from thy sight as thou goest helplessly into that
dread presence. Do thou, therefore, set thy heart on Yoga abstraction
which is possessed of great excellence. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_136.md) Do thou seek to attain that one only
treasure so that thou mayst not have to grieve at the recollection
(after Death) of thy former deeds good and bad all of which are
characterised by error. <span id="fr_137"></span>[2](#fn_137.md)
Decrepitude very soon weakens thy body and robs thee of thy strength and
limbs and beauty. Do thou, therefore, seek that one only treasure. Very
soon the Destroyer, with Disease for his charioteer, will with a strong
hand, for taking thy life, pierce and break thy body. Do thou, therefore
practise austere penance. Very soon will, those terrible wolves that
reside within thy body, assail thee from every side. Do thou endeavour,
therefore, to achieve acts of righteousness. <span
id="fr_138"></span>[3](#fn_138.md) Very soon wilt thou, all alone, behold a
thick darkness, and very soon wilt thou behold golden trees on the top
of the hill. Do thou, therefore, hasten to achieve acts of
righteousness. <span id="fr_139"></span>[4](#fn_139.md) Very soon will
those evil [companions](errata.htm#164.md) and foes of thine, (*viz*., the
senses), dressed in the guise of friends, swerve thee from correct
vision. Do thou, then, O son, strive to achieve that which is of the
highest good. Do thou earn that wealth which has no fear from either
kings or thieves, and which one has not to abandon even at Death. Earned
by one's own acts, that wealth has never to be divided among co-owners.
Each enjoys that wealth (in the other world) which each has earned for
himself. O son, give that to others by which they may be able to live in
the next world. Do thou also set thyself to the acquisition of that
wealth which is [indestructible](errata.htm#165.md) and durable. Do not
think that thou shouldst first enjoy all kinds of pleasures and then
turn thy heart on Emancipation, for before thou art satiated with
enjoyment thou mayst be overtaken by Death. Do thou, in view of this,
hasten to do acts of goodness. <span id="fr_140"></span>[5](#fn_140.md)
Neither mother, nor son, nor relatives, nor dear friends even when
solicited with honours, accompany the man that dies. To the regions of
Yama one has to go oneself, unaccompanied by any one. Only those deeds,
good and bad, that one did before death accompany the man that goes to
the other world. The gold and gems that one has earned by good and bad
means do not become

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

productive of any benefit to one when one's body meets with dissolution.
Of men that have gone to the other world, there is no witness, better
than the soul, of all act done or undone in life. That when the
acting-Chaitanya (Jiva-soul) enters into the
[witness](errata.htm#166.md)-Chaitanya the destruction of the body takes
place, is seen by Yoga-intelligence when Yogins enter the firmament of
their hearts. <span id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_141.md) Even here, the god
of Fire, the Sun and the Wind,--these three reside in the body. These,
beholding as they do all the practices of one's life become one's
witnesses. Days and Nights,--the former characterised by the virtue of
displaying all things and the latter characterised by the virtue of
concealing all things,--are running incessantly and touching all things
(and thereby lessening their allotted periods of existence). Do thou,
therefore, be observant of the duties of thy own order. <span
id="fr_142"></span>[2](#fn_142.md) The road in the other world (that leads
to the regions of Yama), is infested by many foes (in the form of
iron-beaked birds and wolves) and by many repulsive and terrible insects
and worms. Do thou take care of thy own acts, for only acts will
accompany you along that road. These one has not to share one's acts
with others, but every one enjoys or endures the fruits of those acts
which every one has himself performed. As Apsaras and great Rishis
attain to fruits of great felicity, after the same manner, men of
righteous deeds, as the fruits of their respective righteous acts,
obtain in the other world cars of transcendent brightness that move
everywhere at the will of the riders. Men of stainless deeds and
cleansed souls and pure birth obtain in the next world fruits that
correspond with their own righteous acts in this life. By walking along
the high road constituted by the duties of domesticity, men acquire
happy ends by attaining to the region of Prajapati or Vrihaspati or of
him of a hundred sacrifices. I can give thee thousands and thousands of
instructions. Know, however, that the puissant cleanser (*viz*.,
Righteousness), keeps all foolish persons in the Dark. <span
id="fr_143"></span>[3](#fn_143.md) Thou hast passed four and twenty years.
Thou art now full five and twenty years of age. Thy years are passing
away. Do thou beg in to lay thy store of righteousness. The Destroyer
that dwells within error and heedlessness will very soon deprive thy
senses of their respective powers. Do thou before that consummation is
brought about, hasten to observe thy duties, relying on thy body
alone. <span id="fr_144"></span>[4](#fn_144.md) When

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

it is thy duty to go along that road in which thyself only shalt be in
front and thyself only in the rear, what need then hast thou with either
thy body or thy spouse and children? <span
id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_145.md) When men have to go individually and
without companions to the region of Yama, it is plain that in view of
such a situation of terror, thou shouldst seek to acquire that one only
treasure (*viz*., Righteousness or Yogasamadhi). The puissant Yama,
regardless of the afflictions of others, snatches, away the friends and
relatives of one's race by the very roots. There is no one that can
resist him. Do thou, therefore, seek to acquire a stock of righteousness
I impart to thee these lessons, O son, that are all agreeable with the
scriptures I follow. Do thou observe them by acting according to their
import. He who supports his body by following the duties laid down for
his own order, and who makes gifts for earning whatever fruits may
attach to such acts, becomes freed from the consequences that are born
of ignorance and error. <span id="fr_146"></span>[2](#fn_146.md) The
knowledge which a man of righteous deeds acquires from Vedic
declarations leads to omniscience. That omniscience is identical with
the science of the highest object of human acquisition (*viz*.,
Emancipation). Instruction, imparted to the grateful, became beneficial
(in consequence of their leading to the attainment of that highest
object of human acquisition). <span id="fr_147"></span>[3](#fn_147.md) The
pleasure that one takes in living amidst the habitations of men is truly
a fast-binding cord. Breaking that cord, men of righteous deeds repair
to regions of great felicity. Wicked men, however, fail to break that
bond. What use hast thou of wealth, O son, or with relatives, or with
children, since thou hast to die: Do thou employ thyself in seeking for
thy soul which is hidden in a cave. Where have all thy grandsires gone?
Do that today which thou wouldst keep for tomorrow. Do that in the
forenoon which thou wouldst keep for the afternoon. Death does not wait
for any one, to see whether one has or has not accomplished one's task.
Following the body after one's death (to the crematorium), one's
relatives and kinsmen and friends come back, throwing it on the funeral
pyre. Without a scruple do thou avoid those men that are sceptics, that
are destitute of compassion, and that are devoted to wicked ways, and do
thou endeavour to seek, without listlessness

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

or apathy, that which is for thy highest good. When, therefore, the
world is thus afflicted by Death, do thou, with thy whole heart, achieve
righteousness, aided all the while by unswerving patience. That man who
is well conversant with the means of attaining to Emancipation and who
duly discharges the duties of his order, certainly attains to great
felicity in the other world. For thee that dost not recognise death in
the attainment of a different body and that dost not deviate from the
path trod by the righteous, there is no destruction. He that increases
the stock of righteousness is truly wise. He, on the other hand, that
falls away from righteousness is said to be a fool. One that is engaged
in the accomplishment of good deeds attains to heaven and other rewards
as the fruits of those deeds; but he that is devoted to wicked deeds has
to sink in hell. Having acquired the status of humanity, so difficult of
acquisition, that is the stepping-stone to heaven, one should fix one's
soul on Brahma so that one may not fall away once more. That man whose
understanding, directed to the path of heaven, does not deviate
therefrom, is regarded by the wise as truly a man of righteousness and
when he dies his friends should indulge in grief. That man whose
understanding is not restless and which is directed to Brahma and who
has attained to heaven, becomes freed from a great terror (*viz*.,
hell). They that are born in retreats of ascetics and that die there, do
not earn much merit by abstaining all their life from enjoyments and the
indulgence of desire. He, however, who though possessed of objects of
enjoyment casts them off and engages himself in the practice of
penances, succeeds in acquiring everything. The fruits of the penances
of such a man are, I think, much higher. Mothers and sires and sons and
spouses, by hundreds and thousands, every one had and will have in this
world. Who, however, were they and whose are we? I am quite alone. I
have no one whom I may call mine. Nor do I belong to any one else. I do
not see that person whose I am, nor do I see him whom I may call mine.
They have nothing to do with thee. Thou hest nothing to do with
them. <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_148.md) All creatures take birth
agreeably to their acts of past lives. Thou also shalt have to go hence
(for taking birth in a new order) determined by thy own acts. In this
world it is seen that the friends and followers of only those that are
rich behave towards the rich with devotion. The friends and followers of
those, however, that are poor fall away during even the life-time of the
poor. Man commits numerous evil acts for the sake of his wife (and
children). From those evil acts he derives much distress both here and
hereafter. The wise man beholds the world of life devastated by the acts
performed by every living being. Do thou, therefore, O son, act
according to all the instructions I have given thee!

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The man possessed of true vision, beholding this
world to be only a field of action, should, from desire of felicity in
the next world, do acts that are good. Time, exerting his irresistible
strength, cooks all creatures (in his own cauldron), with the aid of his
ladle constituted by months and seasons, the sun for his fire, and days
and nights for his fuel, days and nights, that is that are the witnesses
of the fruits of every act done by every creature. For what purpose is
that wealth which is not given away and which is not enjoyed? For what
purpose is that strength which is not employed in resisting or
subjugating one's foes? For what purpose is that knowledge of the
scriptures which does not impel one to deeds of righteousness? And for
what purpose is that soul which does not subjugate the senses and
abstain from evil acts? "Bhishma continued, 'Having heard these
beneficial words spoken by the Island-born (Vyasa), Suka, leaving his
sire, proceeded to seek a preceptor that could teach him the religion of
Emancipation.'" <span id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_149.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_127"></span>[73:1](m12c021.htm#fr_127.md) These foes are, of
course, the passions.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[73:2](m12c021.htm#fr_128.md) Literally, the world
is only a held of action, implying that creatures, coming here, have to
act: these actions lead to rewards and punishments, both here and
hereafter. The way to Emancipation is, as has been often shown before,
by exhausting the consequences of acts by enjoyment or sufferance and by
abstaining, from further acts by adopting the religion of *Nivritti*.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[74:1](m12c021.htm#fr_129.md) *Kulapatam* is
explained by the commentator as *Mahanadipuram*. In *Naram* etc,
*venumivodahritam* (as in the Bombay text) or *venumivoddhhatam* (as in
the Bengal text) is rather unintelligible unless it be taken in the
sense in which I have taken it. K. P. Singha mistranslates *Kulapatam*,
and the Burdwan translator misunderstands both *Kulaparam* and
*venumivoddhatam*.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[74:2](m12c021.htm#fr_130.md) *i.e.*, to uphold it
by doing the duties of a Brahmans.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[75:1](m12c021.htm#fr_131.md) *Prachalita-dharma*
etc, implies those that have fallen away from righteousness. The Burdwan
translator misunderstands the verse. *Karanabhih* is *kriabhih*.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[75:2](m12c021.htm#fr_132.md) The Commentator
explains that this verse is for assuring Yudhishthira that kings are
competent to obtain felicity in the next world. *Anupagatam* is
explained by the Commentator as not attainable in even thousands of
births.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[75:3](m12c021.htm#fr_133.md) *Rudhirapah* is
blood-sucking worms. *Uparatam* is dead.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[75:4](m12c021.htm#fr_134.md) The ten boundaries
or commandments, as mentioned by the Commentator, are the five positive
ones, *viz*., Purity, Contentment, Penances, Study of the Vedas,
Meditation on God, and the five negative ones, *viz*., abstention from
cruelty, from untruth, from theft, from non-observance of vows, and from
acquisition of wealth.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[75:5](m12c021.htm#fr_135.md) *Chirasya* is
grammatically connected with *na vudhyase*, meaning 'that thou art
always blind etc.' The Burdwan translator misunderstands it completely
and takes it as equivalent to *achirena*. K. P. Singha skips over it.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[76:1](m12c021.htm#fr_136.md) The Burdwan
translator gives a ridiculous version of the verse.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[76:2](m12c021.htm#fr_137.md) *Kevalam nidhim* is
literally, 'ones only treasure'. It may imply either *Samadhi* or
*Brahma*. Acts, whether good or bad, all arise from error. Abstention
from acts is the true way to Emancipation.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[76:3](m12c021.htm#fr_138.md) The passions are
spoken of as wolves.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[76:4](m12c021.htm#fr_139.md) The sight of golden
trees is a premonitory sign of Death.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[76:5](m12c021.htm#fr_140.md) Literally rendered,
the verse would run thus: Before the cooking is complete of the *Yavaka*
of a rich man, in fact, while it is still uncooked, thou mayst meet with
death. Do thou, therefore, hasten. By *Yavaka* is meant a particular
kind of food made of ghee and flour or barley.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[77:1](m12c021.htm#fr_141.md) In verse 53 it is
said that the Soul is the witness in the other world of all acts and
omission in this life. In verse 54, what is said is that the existence
of the Soul when the body is not, is possible, for Yogins, in Yoga, live
in their Soul, unconscious the while of their bodies. The entrance of
the acting-Chaitanya into that Chaitanya which survives as the witness
means the death of the body.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[77:2](m12c021.htm#fr_142.md) The Burdwan
translator gives an erroneous version of this verse.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[77:3](m12c021.htm#fr_143.md) I think the sense is
that only righteousness can bring a man to the path that leads to
happiness and not mere instructions howsoever repeated.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[77:4](m12c021.htm#fr_144.md) The Commentator
explains that *Pramadagah* is equivalent to *Pramadagrihavasin* and
refers to *Antakah*. *Chamum* is *Indriyasenam Grahitam* is body.
*Yathagrahitam* is *dehamanatikramya*. In this verse *pura* may mean
either in the near future or soon, or *pura* may mean before, *i.e.*,
before the Destroyer makes thy senses so, etc.'

<span id="fn_145"></span>[78:1](m12c021.htm#fr_145.md) The road in which
thyself shalt be in front and thyself in the rear is the road of
Self-knowledge. The Burdwan translator does not understand how the first
line comes to mean Knowledge of Self! Accordingly, though he uses the
word *amajnana* (following the Commentator), yet he erroneously repeats
some of the words used in the line.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[78:2](m12c021.htm#fr_146.md) The last word of the
second line is *muchyate* and not *yujyate*. If *yujyate* be adhered to,
meaning would be 'freed the consequences of ignorance and error, he
would succeed in attaining to Brahma.'

<span id="fn_147"></span>[78:3](m12c021.htm#fr_147.md) This is a very
abstruse verse. I have rendered it, following the lead of the
Commentator, *Srutam*, he explains it 'the knowledge, born of vedic
declarations like *Tattwamasi* etc. *Sarvamasnute* is equivalent to
*samastam Brahmandam vyapnoti*, meaning such knowledge leads to
*sarvatmyam*, *i.e.*, omniscience *Tadetat* etc., *i.e.*, that
omniscience is the *darsanam*, of *parampurushartha* or *Moksha*.
*Kritajna upadishtam artham* is *Samhitam*.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[79:1](m12c021.htm#fr_148.md) The sense is that in
course of our repeated rebirths we have got these relations repeatedly
and will get them as repeatedly. But we are, in reality, quite
unconnected with them. Their union with us like the union of pieces of
wood floating in a river, now joined together temporarily, now
separated.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[80:1](m12c021.htm#fr_149.md) *Mokshadaisikam* is
explained by the commentator as *Mokshandeshataram*. K. P. Singha
wrongly renders this word. This section is called *pavakadhyayanam*,
meaning *chitta-sodhakadhyayanam*, that is, the lesson which, when read
and mastered, is to lead to the cleansing of the heart.
