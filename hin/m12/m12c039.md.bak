### SECTION CCCXL

"Bhishma said, 'Thus hymned with names that were not known to others,
the Divine Narayana having the universe for his form showed himself to
the ascetic Narada. His form was somewhat purer than the moon and
differed from the moon in some respects. He somewhat resembled a blazing
fire in complexion. The puissant Lord was somewhat of the

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

form of Vishti. <span id="fr_243"></span>[1](#fn_243.md) He resembled in
some respects the feathers of the parrot, and in some a mass of pure
crystal. He resembled in some respects a hill of antimony and in some a
mass of pure gold. His complexion somewhat resembled the coral when
first formed, and was somewhat white. In some respects that complexion
resembled the hue of gold and in some that of the [*lapis
lazuli*](errata.htm#188.md). In some respects it resembled the hue of the
blue [*lapis lazuli*](errata.htm#189.md) and in some that of sapphire. In
some respects it resembled the hue of the peacock's neck, and in some
that of a string of pearls. Bearing these diverse kinds of hues on his
person, the eternal Deity appeared before Narada. He had a thousand eyes
and was possessed of great beauty. He had a hundred heads and a hundred
feet. He had a thousand stomachs and a thousand arms. He seemed to be
still inconceivable to the mind. With one of his mouths he uttered the
syllable *Om* and then the *Gayatri* following *Om*. With mind under
complete control, the great Deity, called by the names of Hari and
Narayana, by his other mouths, multitudinous in number, uttered many
*mantras* from the four Vedas which are known by the name of *Aranyaka*.
The Lord of all the deities, the great God who is adorned in sacrifices,
held in his hands a sacrificial altar, a *Kamandalu*, few white gems, a
pair of sandal, a bundle of *Kusa* blades, a deer-skin, a toothstick,
and a little blazing fire. <span id="fr_244"></span>[2](#fn_244.md) With
cheerful soul, that foremost of regenerate persons, *viz*., Narada of
restraining speech, bowed unto the great God and adored Him. Unto him
whose head was still bent low in veneration, the first of all the
deities, who is free from deterioration, said the following words.

"'The Holy one said, The great Rishis, Ekata, Dwita, and Trita, came to
this realm from desire of obtaining a sight of me. They, however, were
unable to have the fruition of their wishes. Nor can any one have a
sight of me save those persons that are devoted to me with their whole
hearts. As regards thee, thou art verily the foremost of all persons
devoted to me with all their souls. These are my bodies, the best ones
that I assume. These were born, O regenerate one, in the house of
Dharma. Do thou worship them always, and do thou perform those rites
that are laid down in the ordinances with respect to that worship. O
Brahmana, do thou ask of me the boons thou desirest. I am gratified with
thee to-day, and I appear unto thee now in my universal form as freed
from decay and deterioration.

"Narada said, Since, O holy one, I have today succeeded in obtaining a
sight of thee. I regard that I have won without any delay the fruits of
my penances, O God, of my self-restraint, and of all the vows and
observances

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

that I have gone through. This, indeed, is the highest boon thou hast
granted me for thou hast shown thyself to me today. O Eternal Lord,
Thou, O holy one, hast the universe for thy eye. Thou art the Lion. Thy
form is identifiable with everything. Possessed of puissance, thou, O
Lord, art vast and infinite.

Bhishma continued, 'Having thus shown Himself unto Narada, the son of
Parameshthi, the great God addressed that ascetic and said,--Go hence, O
Narada, and do not delay! These worshippers of mine, possessed of lunar
complexions, are divested of all senses and do not subsist upon any kind
of food. They are, again, all Emancipate; with minds wholly concentrated
upon Me, people should think of Me. Such worshippers will never meet
with any impediments. These men are all crowned with ascetic success and
are highly blessed. In ancient times they became entirely devoted to me.
They have been freed from the attributes of Rajas and Tamas. Without
doubt, they are competent to enter me and become merged into my
Self.--He that cannot be seen with the eye, touched with the sense of
touch, smelt with the sense of scent, and that is beyond the ken of the
sense of taste. He whom the three attributes of Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas
do not touch, who pervades all things and is the one Witness of the
universe, and who is described as the Soul of the entire universe; He
who is not destroyed upon the destruction of the bodies of all created
things, who is unborn and unchangeable and eternal, who is freed from
all attributes, who is indivisible and entire; He who transcends the
twice twelve topics of enquiry and is regarded the Twenty-fifth, who is
called by the name of Purusha, who is inactive, and who is said to be
apprehended by Knowledge alone, He into whom the foremost of the
regenerate persons enter and become emancipate. He who is the eternal
Supreme Soul and is known by the name of Vasudeva. Behold, O Narada, the
greatness and puissance of God. He is never touched by acts good or bad.
Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas, are said to be the three (original) attributes.
These dwell and act in the bodies of all creatures. The Jiva-soul,
called Kshetrajna, enjoys and endorse the action of these three
attributes. He, however, transcends them and they cannot touch Him.
Freed from these attributes, He is again their enjoyer and endorser.
Having created them Himself, He is above them all. O celestial Rishi,
the Earth, which is the refuge of the universe, disappears <span
id="fr_245"></span>[1](#fn_245.md) (when the hour for universal dissolution
comes) into water, Water disappears into Light, and Light into Wind,
Wind disappears into Space, and Space into Mind. Mind is a great
creature, and it disappears into Unmanifest Prakriti. Unmanifest
Prakriti, O Brahmana, disappears into inactive Purusha. There is nothing
higher than Purusha which is Eternal. There is nothing among mobile and
immobile things in the universe that is immutable, except Vasudeva, the
eternal Purusha. Endued with great puissance, Vasudeva is the Soul of
all creatures. Earth, Wind, Space, Water, and Light forming the fifth,
the primal elements of great puissance. Mingling together

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

they form what is called the body. Possessed of subtile prowess and
invisible to all eyes, O Brahmana, the puissant Vasudeva then enter that
combination of the five primal elements, called body. Such entrance is
called his birth, and taking birth. He causes the body to move about and
act. Without a combination of the five primal elements, no body can ever
be formed. Without, again, the entrance of Jiva into the body, the mind
dwelling within it cannot cause it to move and act. He that enters the
body is possessed of great puissance and is called Jiva. He is known
also by other names, *viz*., Sesha and Sankarshana. He that takes his
rise, from that Sankarshana, by his own acts, Sanatkumara, and in whom
all creatures merge when the universal dissolution comes, is the Mind of
all creatures and is called by the name of Pradyumna. From Him (*i.e.*,
Pradyumna), arises He who is the Creator, and who is both Cause and
Effect. From this last, everything, *viz*., the mobile and immobile
universe, takes its rise. This one is called Aniruddha. He is otherwise
called Isana, and He is manifest in all acts. <span
id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_246.md) That illustrious one, *viz*., Vasudeva,
who is called Kshetrajna, and who is freed from attributes, should, O
king of kings, be known as the puissant Sankarshana, when he takes birth
as Jiva. <span id="fr_247"></span>[2](#fn_247.md) From Sankarshana arises
Pradyumna who is called 'He that is born as Mind.' From Pradyumna is He
who is Aniruddha. He is [Consciousness](errata.htm#190.md), He is Iswara
(Supreme Lord). It is from me, that the entire mobile and immobile
universe springs. It is from me, O Narada, that the indestructible and
destructible, the existent and the non-existent, flow. They that are
devoted to me enter into me and become emancipate. I am known as
Purusha. Without acts, I am the Twenty-fifth. Transcending attributes, I
am entire and indivisible. I am above all pairs of opposite attributes
and freed from all attachments. This, O Narada, thou wilt fail to
understand. Thou beholdest me as endued with a form. In a moment, if the
wish arises, I can dissolve this form. I am the Supreme Lord and the
[Preceptor](errata.htm#191.md) of the universe. That which thou beholdest
of me, O Narada, is only an illusion of mine. I now seem to be endued
with the attributes of all created things. Thou art not competent to
know me. I have disclosed to thee duly my quadruple form. I am, O
Narada, the Doer, I am Cause, and I am Effect. I am the sum-total of all
living creatures. All living creatures have their refuge in me. Let not
the thought be thine that thou hast seen the Kshetrajna. I pervade all
things. O Brahmana, and am the *Jiva-Soul* of all creatures. When the
bodies of all creatures, however, are destroyed, I am not destroyed.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Those highly blessed men who, having won ascetic
success, become wholly devoted to me, become freed from the attributes
of both Rajas and Tamas and succeeds, on that account, in entering me, O
great ascetic. He who is called Hiranyagarbha, who is the beginning of
the world, who has four faces, who cannot be understood with the aid of
*Nirukta*, who is otherwise called Brahman, who is an eternal deity, is
employed in attending to many of my concerns. The deity Rudra, born of
my wrath, is sprung from my forehead. Behold, the eleven Rudras are
swelling (with might) on the right side of my body. The twelve Adityas
are on the left side of my body. Behold, the eight Vasus, those foremost
of deities, are in my front, and see, Nasatya and Dasra, those two
celestial physicians (Aswini Kumars), are in my rear. Behold also in my
body all the Prajapatis and behold the seven Rishis also. Behold also
the Vedas, and all the Sacrifices numbering by hundreds, the Amrita
(nectar), and all the (medicinal) herbs and plants, and Penances, and
vows and observances of diverse kinds. Behold also in me the eight
attributes indicative of puissance, *viz*., those particularly called
the attributes of Lordship, all dwelling together in my body in their
united and embodied form. Behold also Sree and Lakshmi, and Kirti, and
the Earth with her hump as also the goddess, Saraswati, that mother of
the Vedas, dwelling in me. Behold, O Narada, Dhruva, that foremost of
luminaries ranging the firmament, as also all the Oceans those
receptacles of water, and lakes, and rivers, dwelling in me. Behold
also, O best of men, the four foremost ones amongst the Pitris in their
embodied forms, as also, the three attributes (of Sattwa, Rajas, and
Tamas) which are formless dwelling in me. The acts done in honour of the
Pitris are superior (in point of merit) to those done in honour of the
deities. I am the *Pitri* of both the deities and the Pitris, and am
existing from the beginning (that is, from a time when they were not).
Becoming the Equine-head I rove through the Western and the Northern
ocean and drink sacrificial libations duly poured with *mantras* and
solid sacrificial food offered with reverence and devotion. In days of
yore I created Brahman who himself adored me in sacrifices. Gratified
with him on that account I granted him many excellent boons. I said unto
him that in the beginning of the Kalpa he would be born unto me as my
son, and the sovereignty of all the worlds would vest on him, coupled
with diverse names being bestowed on diverse objects in consequence of
the starting of Ahankara into existence. <span
id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_248.md) I also told him that none would ever
violate the limits and boundaries he would assign (for the observance of
creatures) and, further, that he would be the giver of boons unto

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

persons that would (in sacrifices and by proper acts) solicit him for
them. I further assured him that he would be an object of adoration with
all the deities and Asuras, all the Rishis and Pitris, and the diverse
creatures forming the creation. I also gave him to understand that I
would always manifest myself for accomplishing the business of the
deities and that for that matter I would suffer myself to be commanded
by him even as a son by his sire. <span id="fr_249"></span>[1](#fn_249.md)
Granting these and other highly agreeable boons unto Brahman of
immeasurable energy in consequence of my being gratified with him I
(once more) adopted the course dictated by Nivritti. The highest
Nivritti is identical with the annihilation of all duties and acts.
Hence, by [adopting](errata.htm#192.md) Nivritti one should conduct oneself
in complete felicity. Learned preceptors, with settled convictions
deducted from the truths of the Sankhya philosophy, have spoken of me as
Kapila endued with the puissance of Knowledge, dwelling within the
effulgence of Surya, and concentrated in Yoga. <span
id="fr_250"></span>[2](#fn_250) In Chcchandas (Vedas.md) I have been
repeatedly hymned as the illustrious Hiranyagarbha. In the Yoga
scriptures, O Brahmana, I have been spoken of as one who takes a delight
in Yoga. I am eternal. Assuming a form that is manifest, I dwell, at
present, in the heavens. At the end of a thousand Yugas I shall once
more with-draw the universe into myself. Having withdrawn all creatures,
mobile and immobile into myself, I shall exist all alone with knowledge
only for my companion. After the lapse of ages I shall again create the
universe, with the aid of that knowledge. That which is my fourth form
creates the indestructible Sesha. That Sesha is called by the name of
Sankarshana. Sankarshana creates Pradyumna. From Pradyumna I take birth
myself as Aniruddha. I create (myself) repeatedly. From Aniruddha
springs Brahman. The latter takes birth from Aniruddha's
[navel](errata.htm#193.md). From Brahman spring all creatures mobile and
immobile. Know that Creation springs in this way repeatedly at the
beginning of every Kalpa. Creation and destruction succeed each other
even as sunrise and sunset in this world. Then, again, as Time, endued
with immeasurable energy, forcibly brings back the Sun after his
disappearance, after the same manner I shall, assuming the form of boar
and putting forth my strength, bring back the Earth with her belt of
seas to her own position for the good of all creatures when she becomes
submerged in water. I shall then slay the son of Diti,

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

named Hiranyaksha, filled with pride of strength. <span
id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_251.md) Assuming the form then of a Man-lion
(Narsingha), I shall, for [benefiting](errata.htm#194.md) the deities, slay
Hiranyakasipu the son of Diti, who will be a great destroyer of
sacrifices. Unto Virochana (the son of Prahlada) will be born a mighty
son of the name of Vali. That great Asura will be unslayable in the
whole universe consisting of deities, Asuras and Rakshasas. He will hurl
Sakra from the sovereignty of the universe. When after routing the Lord
of Sachi, that Asura will take unto himself the sovereignty of the three
worlds, I shall take birth in Aditi's womb, by Kasyapa, as the twelfth
Aditya. I shall (taking the sovereignty of the three worlds Vali)
restore it to Indra of immeasurable splendour, and replace the deities,
O Narada, in their respective stations. As regards Vali, that foremost
of Danavas, who is to be unslayable by all the deities, I shall cause
him to dwell in the nether regions. In the Treta age I shall take birth
as Rama in the race of Bhrigu, and exterminate the Kshatriyas who will
become proud of their strength and possessions. Towards the close of
Treta and the beginning of Dwapara, I shall take birth as Rama, the son
of Dasaratha in Iskshaku's royal line. At that time, the two Rishis
*viz*., the two sons of Prajapati, called by the names of Ekata and
Dwita, will in consequence of the injury done by them unto their brother
Trita, have to take birth as apes, losing the beauty of the human form.
Those apes that shall take birth in the race of Ekata and Dwita, shall
become endued with great strength and mighty energy and will equal Sakra
himself in prowess. All those apes, O regenerate one, will become my
allies for accomplishing the business of the deities. I shall then slay
the terrible lord of the Rakshasas, that wretch of Pulastya's race,
*viz*., the fierce Ravana, that throne of all the worlds, together with
all his children and followers. Towards the close of the Dwapara and
beginning of the Kali ages, I shall again appear in the world taking
birth in the city of Mathura for the purpose of slaying Kansa. There,
after slaying innumerable Danavas that will be thorns in the side of the
deities, I shall take up my residence in Kusasthali at the city of
Dwaraka. While residing in that city I shall slay the Asura Naraka, the
son of 'the Earth,--him, that is, who will do an injury to Aditi, as
also some 'other Danavas of the names of Muru and Pitha. Slaying also
another foremost of Danavas, *viz*., the lord of Pragjyotisha, I shall
transplant his delightful city furnished with diverse kinds of wealth
into Dwaraka. I shall then subjugate the two gods worshipped of all the
deities, *viz*., Maheshwara and Mahasena, who will become fond of the
Danava Vana and do him diverse good offices and who will exert
themselves vigorously for that worshipper of theirs. <span
id="fr_252"></span>[2](#fn_252.md)

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Vanquishing next the son of the Danava Vali,
*viz*., Vana, who will be endued with a thousand arms, I shall next
destroy all the inhabitants of the Danava city called Saubha. <span
id="fr_253"></span>[1](#fn_253.md) I shall next, O foremost of Brahmanas,
compass the death of Kalayavana, a Danava who will be endued with great
might in consequence of his being equipt with the energy of
Gargya. <span id="fr_254"></span>[2](#fn_254.md) A proud Asura will appear
as a king at Girivraja, of the name of Jarasandha, who will quarrel with
all the other kings of the world. His death will be compassed by me
through some one else guided by my intelligence. I shall next slay
Sisupala in the sacrifice of king Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, which
sacrifice all the kings of the world will bring tribute. In some of
these feats, only Arjuna, the son of Vasava, will become my assistant. I
shall establish Yudhishthira with all his brothers in his ancestral
kingdom. People will call me and Arjuna as Narayana and Nara, when,
endued with puissance, we two, exerting our strength, shall consume a
large number of Kshatriyas, for doing good to the world. Having
lightened the burthen of the Earth according to our pleasure, I shall
absorb all the principal Sattwatas as also Dwaraka, my favourite city,
into my own self, recollecting my all-embracing Knowledge. Endued with
four forms, I shall, in this way, achieve many feats of great prowess,
and attain at last to those regions of felicity created by me and
honoured by all the Brahmanas. Appearing in the forms of a swan, a
tortoise, a fish, O foremost of regenerate ones, I shall then display
myself as a boar, then as a Man-lion (Nrisingha), then as a dwarf, then
as Rama of Bhrigu's race, then as Rama, the son of Dasaratha, then as
Krishna the scion of the Sattwata race, and lastly as Kalki. When the
auditions in the Vedas disappeared from the world, I brought them back.
The Vedas with the auditions in them, were re-created by me in the Krita
age. They have once more disappeared or may only be partially heard here
and there in the Puranas. Many of my best appearances also in the world
have become events of the past. Having achieved the good of the worlds
in those forms in which I appeared, they have re-entered into my own
Prakriti. Brahman (the Creator) himself never obtained a sight of me in

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

this form of mine, which thou, O Narada, hast seen today in consequence
of thy entire devotion to me. I have now said everything, O
Brahmana,--unto thee that art devoted to me wholly, I have disclosed to
thee my ancient appearances and future ones also, O Best of men,
together with all their mysteries. "Bhishma continued, The holy and
illustrious deity, of universal and immutable form, having said these
words unto Narada, disappeared there and then. Narada also, endued with
great energy, having obtained the high favour that he had solicited,
then proceeded with great speed to the retreat called Vadari, for
beholding Nara and Narayana. This great Upanishad, perfectly consist
with the four Vedas, in harmony with Sankhya-yoga, and called by him by
the name of the Pancharatra scriptures, and recited by Narayana himself
with his own mouth, was repeated by Narada in the presence of many
hearers in the abode of Brahman (his sire) in exactly the same way in
which Narayana (while that great god had showed himself unto him) had
recited it, and in which he had heard it from his own lips.

"Yudhishthira said, 'Was not Brahman, the Creator of all things,
acquainted with this wonderful narrative of the glory of Narayana endued
with intelligence that he heard it from the lips of Narada? Is the
illustrious Grandsire of all the worlds any way different from or
inferior to the great Narayana? How then is it that he was unacquainted
with the puissance of Narayana of immeasurable energy?'

Bhishma continued, 'Hundreds and thousands of great-Kalpas, hundreds and
thousands of Creation and Dissolutions, O king of kings, have been over
and have become incidents of the past. <span
id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_255.md) In the beginning of every cycle of
Creation, Brahman, endued with great puissance and who creates all
things, is remembered (by Narayana). Brahman knows well, O king, that
Narayana, that foremost of all gods is very much superior to him. He
knows that Narayana is the Supreme Soul, that he is the Supreme Lord,
that He is the Creator of Brahman himself. It was only unto that
conclave of Rishis, crowned with ascetic success, that came to the abode
of Brahman, that Narada recited his narrative which is a very ancient
one, and which is perfectly consistent with the Vedas. The deity Surya,
having heard that narrative from those Rishis crowned with ascetic

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

success, <span id="fr_256"></span>[1](#fn_256.md) repeated it to the six
and sixty thousands of Rishis, O king, of cleansed souls, that follow in
his train. And Surya, the deity that imparts heat unto all worlds,
repeated that narrative unto those Beings also, of cleansed souls, that
have been created (by Brahman) for always journeying in the van of
Surya. <span id="fr_257"></span>[2](#fn_257.md) The high-souled Rishis that
follow in Surya's train, O son, repeated that excellent narrative unto
the deities assembled on the breast of Meru. That best of ascetics,
*viz*., the regenerate Asita, then having heard the narrative from the
deities, repeated it unto the Pitris, O king of kings. I heard it from
my sire Santanu, O son, who recited it to me formerly. Myself having
heard it from my sire. I have repeated it to thee, O Bharata. Deities
and Munis, who have heard this excellent old narrative, which is a
*Purana*--all adore the Supreme Soul. This narrative, belonging to the
Rishis and thus handed down from one to another, should not, O king, be
communicated by thee to any one that is not a worshipper of Vasudeva.
This narrative, O king, is really the essence of the hundreds of other
narratives that thou hast heard from me. In days of yore, O monarch, the
deities and the Asuras, uniting together, churned the Ocean and t wised
the Amrita. After the same manner, the Brahmanas, uniting together in
days of yore, churned all the scriptures and raised this narrative which
resembles nectar. He who frequently reads this narrative, and he who
frequently listens to it, with concentrated attention, in a retired
spot, and filled with devotion, succeeds in becoming a denizen,
possessed of lunar complexion, of the spacious island known by the name
of White Island. Without doubt, such a man succeeds in entering into
Narayana of a thousand rays. A sick person, by listening to this
narrative from the beginning, becomes freed from his illness. The man
that simply desires to read or listen to this narrative obtains the
fruition of all his wishes. To devoted worshipper, by reading or
listening to it, attains to the high end that is reserved for devoted
worshippers. Thou also, O monarch, shouldst always adore and worship
that foremost of all Beings. He is the father and the mother of all
creatures, and He is an object of reverence with the entire universe.
Let the illustrious and Eternal God of the Brahmans, *viz*., Janarddana
of high intelligence, be gratified with thee, O Yudhishthira of mighty
arms!'"

Vaisampayana continued, "Having listened to the best of narratives, O
Janamejaya, king Yudhishthira the just and all his brothers became

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

devoted to Narayana. And all of them, O Bharata, betaking themselves to
the practice of silently meditating upon Narayana (from that day),
uttered these words for His glorification, *viz*., 'Victory to that holy
and illustrious Being.' He, again, who is our best of preceptors,
*viz*., the Island-born Krishna, devoted to penances, sung uttering the
word Narayana that high mantra which is worthy of being recited in
silence. Sojourning through the welkin to the Ocean of Milk which is
always the abode of nectar, and worshipping the great God there, he came
back to his own hermitage.

"Bhishma continued, '1 have now repeated to thee the narrative that was
recited by Narada (unto the conclave of Rishis assembled in the abode of
Brahman). That narrative has descended from one person to another from
very ancient times. I heard it from my sire who formerly repeated it to
me.'"

Suta continued, I have now told you all that Vaisampayana recited to
Janamejaya. Having listened to Vaisampayana's narration, king Janamejaya
properly discharged all his duties according to the ordinances laid down
in the scriptures. Ye have all undergo very severe penances and observed
many high and excellent vows. Residing in this sacred forest that is
known by the name of Naimisha, ye are foremost of all persons conversant
with the Vedas. Ye foremost of regenerate ones, ye all have come to this
great sacrifice of Saunaka. Do ye all adore and worship that Eternal and
Supreme Lord of the universe in excellent sacrifices, properly pouring
libations of clarified butter into the fire with the aid of *mantras*
and dedicating the same unto Narayana. As regards myself, I heard this
excellent narrative that has descended from generation to gene-ration,
from my sire who recited it to me in former times.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_243"></span>[133:1](m12c039.htm#fr_243.md) By this word is
meant a particular conjunction of heavenly bodies. This con-junction is
represented as having a peculiar form.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[133:2](m12c039.htm#fr_244.md) The word *Upanaha*
used here in the dual number, has puzzled many persons. It is difficult
to conceive why the great God should appear with a pair of shoes in one
of his hands. Probably, the *Upanaha*, in ancient times, was a wooden
sandal, and what the poet means to say is that Narayana, appeared with
all the requisites of a *Brahmacharin* on his person.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[134:1](m12c039.htm#fr_245.md) *i.e.*, merges
into.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[135:1](m12c039.htm#fr_246.md) This cosmogony is
agreeable to the Vaishnava scriptures. Above all, without beginning is
Vasudeva. From Vasudeva is Sankarshana. From Sankarashana is Pradyumna.
From Pradyumna is Aniruddha. Some persons find in this quadruple
creation the distinct trace of the Christian Trinity. It is very
difficult, however, to say which doctrine, the Hindu or the Christian,
is the original and which is derived from which.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[135:2](m12c039.htm#fr_247.md) The reader is
requested to mark the address 'king of kings'. This is evidently a slip
of the pen. The whole speech is that of Narayana and Narada is the
listener.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[136:1](m12c039.htm#fr_248.md) The commentator is
silent. The sense seems to be that as Brahman is to be the son of
Narayana in the beginning of a Kalpa when there is no other existent
object mobile or immobile, the same Brahman is to be vested with
dominion over all things which he would himself create through Ahankara.
Of course, as long as Brahman is without Ahankara so long there can be
no Creation, *i.e.*, no subjects mobile and immobile, to be known by
different names.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[137:1](m12c039.htm#fr_249.md) *Nityada* is
always. Some persons believe that Narayana has to manifest himself
always for achieving the business of the deities. This Earth is not the
only world where such manifestations needed. As to the object of the
manifestations considerable difference of opinion prevails. In the
*Gita*, the great deity himself explains that that object is to rescue
the good and destroy the wicked. Others hold that this is only a
secondary object, the primary one being to gladden the hearts of the
devout by affording them opportunities of worshipping him and applauding
his acts, and to indulge in new joys by serving his own worshippers.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[137:2](m12c039.htm#fr_250.md) This is a reference
to the well-known description of Narayana as
*Savitrimandalamadhyavartih* etc. It is not the visible Sun whose disc
is meant, but that pure fountain of effulgence which is inconceivable
for its dazzling brightness that is implied.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[138:1](m12c039.htm#fr_251.md) The tense used in
the original is future. What is meant, however, is that the great deity
does these acts at the beginning of every Kalpa when he recreates the
Earth. All cycles or Kalpas are similar in respect of the incidents that
occur in them.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[138:2](m12c039.htm#fr_252.md) *Maheswara* is
*Mahadeva* or *Siva*, *Mahasena* is *Kartikeya*, the generalissimo of
the celestial forces.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[139:1](m12c039.htm#fr_253.md) *Vana*, the son of
*Vali*, was a devout worshipper of Mahadeva. Mina's daughter Usha fell
in love with Krishna's grandson Aniruddha. Aniruddha was imprisoned by
Vana. It was to rescue Aniruddha that Krishna fought with Vana, after
having vanquished both Mahadeva and Kartikeya. The thousand and one arms
of Vana, less two, were lopped off by Krishna. The episode of the love
of Aniruddha and Usha is a very beautiful one.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[139:2](m12c039.htm#fr_254.md) *Saubha* was the
name of a flying city of the *Danavas*. Krishna felled this city into
the ocean, having killed all its Danava inhabitants. As to Kala-yavana,
his death was brought about by Krishna under the following
circumstances. Pursued by the Danava, Krishna took refuge in a
mountain-cave in which a king of the *Satya Yuga* was lying asleep.
Entering the cave, Krishna stood at the head of the sleeping king. The
Danava, entering the cave after Krishna, found the sleeping king and
awaked him. As soon as the king looked at the Danava, the latter was
consumed into ashes, for the gods had given a boon to the king that he
who would awake him would be consumed by a glance of his.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[140:1](m12c039.htm#fr_255.md) The idea of
Eternity without any conceivable beginning and conceivable end was so
thoroughly realised by the Hindu sages that the chiefdom of Heaven
itself was to them the concern of a moment. Nothing less than
unchangeable felicity for all times was the object they pursued. All
other things and states being mutable, and only Brahman being immutable,
what they sought was an identification with Brahma. Such identification
with the Supreme Soul was the Emancipation they sought. No other
religion has ever been able to preach such a high ideal. The Hindu's
concern is with Eternity. He regards his existence here as having the
duration of but the millionth part of a moment. How to prevent re-birth
and attain to an identification with the Supreme Soul is the object of
his pursuit.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[141:1](m12c039.htm#fr_256.md) K. P. Singha has
completely misunderstood the sense of verse 113, Bhishma does not
certainly mean that Brahman was unacquainted with the narrative. What
Bhishma says is that it was not to Brahman, but to the Siddhas assembled
in Brahman's abode, that Narada recited his narrative.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[141:2](m12c039.htm#fr_257.md) K. P. Singha
misunderstands verses 115 and 116 completely. The fact is, Surya recited
the narrative unto those that precede and those that follow him in his
journey through the firmament. K. P. Singha confounded the two classes
of persons together. The Burdwan translator, as usual, makes nonsense of
verse 116. The correct reading (as given in the Bombay text) is *lokan*,
the grammatical construction being *lokan tapatah suryasya* etc. The
Burdwan translator makes Surya repeat the narrative to the worlds
created and placed before Surya.
