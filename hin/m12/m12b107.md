### SECTION CCLXXX

"Usanas said, 'I bow to that divine and illustrious and puissant Being
who holds this earth with the firmament in his arms. I shall speak to
thee of the pre-eminent greatness of that Vishnu whose head, O best of
the *Danavas*, is that Infinite place (called Emancipation).'

"While they were thus conversing with each other there came unto them
the great sage Sanatkumara of righteous soul for the purpose of
dispelling their doubts. Worshipped by the prince of *Asuras* and by the
sage Usanas, that foremost of sages sat down on a costly seat. After
Kumara of great wisdom had been seated (at his ease), Usanas said unto
him, 'Discourse to this chief of the *Danavas* on the pre-eminent
greatness of Vishnu.' Hearing these words, Sanatkumara uttered the
following, fraught with grave import, upon the pre-eminent greatness of
Vishnu unto the intelligent chief of the *Danavas*, 'Listen, O Daitya,
to everything about the greatness of Vishnu. Know, O scorcher of foes,
that the entire universe rests on Vishnu. O thou of mighty arms, it is
He who creates all creatures mobile and immobile. In course of Time it
is He, again, who withdraws all things and in Time it is He who once
more casts them forth from Himself. Into Hari all things merge at the
universal destruction and from Him all things again come forth. Men
possessed of scriptural lore cannot obtain him by such lore. Nor can He
be obtained by Penances, nor by Sacrifices. The only means by which He
can be attained is by restraining the Senses. Nor that sacrifices are
entirely useless towards such an end. For one, by relying upon both
external and internal acts, and upon one's own mind, can purify (them)
by one's own understanding. By such means, one succeeds in enjoying
infinity in the world. <span id="fr_853"></span>[1](#fn_853.md) As

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

a goldsmith purifies the dross of his metal by repeatedly casting it
into the fire with very persistent efforts of his own, after the same
manner Jiva succeeds in cleaning himself by his course through hundreds
of births. Some one may be seen to purify himself in only one life by
mighty efforts. As one should with care wipe stains from off one's
person before they become thick, after the same manner one should, with
vigorous efforts, wash off one's faults. <span
id="fr_854"></span>[1](#fn_854.md) By mixing only a few flowers with them,
grains of sesame cannot be made to cast off their own odour (and become
at once fragrant). After the same manner, one cannot, by cleansing one's
heart only a little, succeed in beholding the Soul. When, however, those
grains are perfumed repeatedly with the aid of a large quantity of
flowers, it is then that they cast off their own odour and assume that
of the flowers with which they are mixed. After this manner, faults, in
the form of attachments to all our environments, are dispelled by the
understanding in course of many lives, with the aid of a large dose of
the attribute of the *Sattwa*, and by means of efforts born of
practice. <span id="fr_855"></span>[2](#fn_855.md) Listen, O Danava, by
what means creatures attached to acts and those unattached to them
attain the causes that lead to their respective states of mind. <span
id="fr_856"></span>[3](#fn_856.md) Listen to me with undivided attention. I
shall, in their due order, discourse to thee, O puissant Danava, as to
how creatures betake themselves to action and how they give up
action. <span id="fr_857"></span>[4](#fn_857.md) The Supreme Lord creates
all creatures mobile and immobile. He is without beginning and without
end. Unendued with attributes of any kind, he assumes attributes (when
he chooses to create). He is the universal Destroyer, the Refuge of all
things, the Supreme Ordainer, and pure Chit. <span
id="fr_858"></span>[5](#fn_858.md) In all creatures it is He who dwells as
the mutable and the immutable. It is He who, having eleven modifications
for His essence, drinketh this universe with His rays. <span
id="fr_859"></span>[6](#fn_859.md) Know that the Earth is His feet. His
head is constituted by Heaven. His arms, O Daitya, are the several
points of the compass or the horizon. The intermediate space is His
ears. The light of His eye is the Sun, and His mind is in the Moon. His
understanding dwells

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

always in Knowledge, and His tongue is in Water. <span
id="fr_860"></span>[1](#fn_860.md) O best of Danavas, the Planets are in
the midst of His brows. The starts and constellations are from the light
of His eyes. The Earth is in His feet. O Danava! Know also that the
attributes of *Rajas*, *Tamas*, and *Sattwa* are of Him. He is the fruit
(or end) of all the modes of life, and He it is who should be known as
the fruit (or reward) of all (pious) acts (such as Japa and Sacrifice,
etc.). <span id="fr_861"></span>[2](#fn_861.md) The Highest and Immutable,
He is also the fruit of abstention from all work. The *Chandas* are the
hair on His body, and *Akshara* (or *Pranava*) is His word. The diverse
orders (of men) and the modes of life are His refuge. His mouths are
many. Duty (or religion) is planted in his heart. He is Brahma; He is
the highest Righteousness; He is *Sat* and He is *Asat*; <span
id="fr_862"></span>[3](#fn_862.md) He is Sruti; He is the scriptures; He is
the Sacrificial vessel; He is the six and ten Ritwijes; He is all the
Sacrifices; He is the Grandsire (Brahman); He is Vishnu; He is the twin
Aswins; and He is Purandara; <span id="fr_863"></span>[4](#fn_863.md) He is
Mitra; He is Varuna; He is Yama; He is Kuvera the lord of treasures.
Although the Ritwijes seem to behold Him as separate, He is, however,
known to them as one and the same. Know that this entire universe is
under the control of One divine Being. <span
id="fr_864"></span>[5](#fn_864.md) The Veda that is in the soul, O prince
of *Daityas*, regards the unity of various creatures. When a living
creature realises this unity in consequence of true knowledge, he is
then said to attain to Brahma. The period of time for which one creation
exists or for which if ceases to exist is called a *Kalpa*. Living
creatures exist for a thousand millions of such Kalpas. Immobile
creatures also exist for an equal period. The period for which a
particular creation exists is measured by many thousands of lakes (in
the following way), O Daitya! Conceive a lake that is one *Yojana* in
width, one *Krosa* in depth, and five hundred *Yojanas* in length.
Imagine many thousands of such lakes. Seek then to dry up those lakes by
taking from them, only once a day, as much water as may be taken up with
the end of a single hair. The number of days would pass in drying them
up completely by this process represents the period that is occupied by
the life of one creation from its first start to the time of its
destruction. <span id="fr_865"></span>[6](#fn_865.md) The highest Evidence
(for all things) says that creatures have six colours, *viz*., Dark,
Tawny, Blue, Red, Yellow, and White. These colours proceed from mixtures
in various proportions of the three attributes of Rajas, Tamas, and
Sattwa. Where Tamas predominates, Sattwa falls below the mark, and Rajas
keeps to

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

the mark, the result is the colour called Dark. When Tamas predominates
as before, but the relations between Sattwa and Rajas are reversed, the
result is the colour called Tawny. When Rajas predominates, Sattwa falls
below the mark, and Tamas keeps to the mark, the result is the colour
called Blue. When Rajas predominates as before and the proportion is
reversed between Sattwa and Tamas, the result is the intermediate colour
called Red. That Colour is more agreeable (than the preceding one). When
Sattwa predominates, Rajas falls below the mark and, Tamas keeps to the
mark, the result is the colour called Yellow. It is productive of
happiness. When Sattwa predominates and the proportion is reversed
between Rajas and Tamas, the result is the colour called White. It is
productive of great happiness. <span id="fr_866"></span>[1](#fn_866.md) The
White is the foremost colour. It is sinless in consequence of its being
free from attachment and aversion. It is without grief, and free from
the toil involved in *Pravritti*. Hence, White, O prince of *Danavas*,
leads to success (or Emancipation). Jiva, O Daitya, having undergone
thousands of births derived through the womb, attains to success. <span
id="fr_867"></span>[2](#fn_867.md) That success is the identical end which
the divine Indra declared after having studied many auspicious spiritual
treatises and which has for its essence the apprehension of the Soul.
The end again that creatures obtain is dependent oil their colour, and
colour, in its turn, depends upon the character of the Time that sets
in, O Daitya! <span id="fr_868"></span>[3](#fn_868.md) The stages of
existence, O Daitya, through which Jiva must pass are not unlimited.
They are fourteen hundreds of thousands ill number. In consequence of
them Jiva ascends, stays, and falls down as the case may be. <span
id="fr_869"></span>[4](#fn_869.md) The end that is attained by a Jiva of
dark flue is very low, for he becomes addicted to acts that lead to hell
and then has to rot in hell. <span id="fr_870"></span>[5](#fn_870.md) The
learned say that in consequence of his wickedness, the continuance (in
such form) of a Jiva is measured

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

by many thousands of Kalpas. <span id="fr_871"></span>[1](#fn_871.md)
Having passed many hundred thousands of years in that condition, Jiva
then attains to the colour called Tawny (and becomes born as an
intermediate creature). In that condition he dwells (for many long
years), in perfect helplessness. At last when his sins are exhausted (in
consequence of his having endured all the misery they are capable of
bringing), his mind, casting off all attachments, cherishes
Renunciation. <span id="fr_872"></span>[2](#fn_872.md) When Jiva becomes
endued with the quality of Sattwa, he then dispels everything connected
with Tamas by the aid of his intelligence, and exerts (for achieving
what is for his good). As the result of this, Jiva attains to the colour
called Red. If the quality of Sattwa, however, be not gained, Jiva then
travels in a round of rebirths in the world of inert, having attained to
the colour called Blue. <span id="fr_873"></span>[3](#fn_873.md) Having
attained to that end (*viz*., Humanity) and having been afflicted for
the duration of one creation by the bonds born of his own acts, Jiva
then attains to the colours called Yellow (or becomes a Deity). Existing
in that condition for the space of a hundred creations, he then leaves
it (for becoming a human being) to return to it once more. <span
id="fr_874"></span>[4](#fn_874.md) Having attained to the Yellow colour,
Jiva exists for thousands of Kalpas, sporting as a Deva. Without,
however, being emancipated (even then), he has to stay in hell, enjoying
or enduring the fruits of his acts of past Kalpas and wandering through
nine and ten thousand courses. <span id="fr_875"></span>[5](#fn_875.md)
Know that Jiva becomes freed from the hell (of acts) as represented by
heaven or godship. After the same manner, Jiva gets, off from the other
births (corresponding with the other colours). Jiva sports for many long
Kalpas in the world of Devas. Falling thence, he once more obtains the
status of Humanity. He then stays in that condition for the space of a
hundred and eight Kalpas. He then attains once more to the status of a
Deva. If while in the status of humanity (for the second time) he
falleth through (evil acts as represented by)

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Kala (in the form of Kali), he then sinks into
the Dark colour and thus occupies the very lowest of all stages of
existence.

"I shall tell thee now, O foremost of *Asuras*, how Jiva succeeds in
effecting his Emancipation. Desirous of Emancipation, Jiva, relying upon
seven hundred kinds of acts every one of which is characterised by a
predominance of the attribute of *Sattwa*, gradually courses through Red
and Yellow and at last attains to White. Arrived here, Jiva travels
through several regions that are most adorable and that have the Eight
well-known regions of felicity beneath them, and all the while pursues
that stainless and effulgent form of existence which is Emancipation's
self. <span id="fr_876"></span>[1](#fn_876.md) Know that the Eight (already
referred to and) which are identical with the Sixty (subdivided into)
hundreds, are, unto those that are highly effulgent, only creations of
the mind (without having any real or independent existence). The highest
object of acquisition with one that is White of hue, is that condition
(called *Turiya*) which transcends the three other states of
consciousness, *viz*., Wakefulness and Dream and Dreamless
slumber. <span id="fr_877"></span>[2](#fn_877.md) As regards that Yogin who
is unable to abandon the felicities that Yoga-puissance brings about, he
has to dwell (in one and the same body) for one century of Kalpas in
auspiciousness and after that in four other regions (called Mahar, Jana,
Tapas, and Satya). Even that is the highest end of one belonging to the
sixth colour, and who is Unsuccessful

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

though crowned with success, and who has transcended all attachments and
passions. <span id="fr_878"></span>[1](#fn_878.md) That Yogin, again, who
falls off from Yoga practices after having attained the measure of
eminence described already resides in heaven for a century of Kalpas
with the, unexhausted remnant of his past acts (to be exhausted by
enjoyment or endurance as the case may be), and with the seven (*viz*.,
the five senses of knowledge and mind and understanding) purged of all
stains in consequence of their predisposition or proneness towards the
attribute of Sattwa. And the expiry of that period, such a person has to
come to the world of men where he attains to great eminence. <span
id="fr_879"></span>[2](#fn_879.md) Turning back from the world of men, he
departs for attaining to new forms of existence that run higher and
higher in the upward scale. While engaged in this, he courseth through
seven regions for seven times, his puissance being always increased in
consequence of his Samadhi and the re-awakening from it. <span
id="fr_880"></span>[3](#fn_880.md) The Yogin who is desirous of final
Emancipation suppresses by Yoga-knowledge the seven, and continues to
dwell in the world of life, freed from attachments; and taking those
seven for certain means of grief, he casts them off and attains
afterwards to that state which is Indestructible and Infinite. Some say
that

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

that is the region of Mahadeva; some, of Vishnu; some, of Brahman; some,
of Sesha; some, of Nara; some, of the effulgent Chit; and some, of the
All-pervading. <span id="fr_881"></span>[1](#fn_881.md) When universal
destruction comes, those persons who have succeeded in completely
consuming by Knowledge their gross and subtle and karana bodies, always
enter into Brahma. All their Senses also which have action for their
essence and which are not identical with Brahma, merge into the same.
When the time of universal destruction comes, those Jivas who have
attained to the position of Devas and who have an unexhausted remnant of
the fruits of acts to enjoy or endure, revert to those stages of life in
the subsequent Kalpa which had been theirs in the previous one. This is
due to the similarity of every successive Kalpa to every previous one.
Those again whose acts, at the time of universal destruction, have been
exhausted by enjoyment or endurance in respect of their fruits, falling
down from heaven, take birth among men, in the subsequent Kalpa, for
without Knowledge one cannot destroy one's acts in even a hundred
Kalpas. All superior Beings again, endued with similar powers and
similar forms, revert to their respective destinies at a new creation
after a universal destruction, ascending and descending precisely in the
same manner as during the creation that is dissolved. <span
id="fr_882"></span>[2](#fn_882.md) As regards, again, the person who is
conversant with Brahma, as long as he continues to enjoy and endure the
unexhausted remnant of his acts of previous Kalpas, it is said that all
creatures and the two stainless sciences live in his body. When his
Chitta becomes cleansed by Yoga, and when he practises Samyama, this
perceptible universe appears to him as only his own fivefold
senses. <span id="fr_883"></span>[3](#fn_883.md) Enquiring with a cleansed
mind, Jiva attains to a high and stainless end. Thence he attains to a
spot which knows no deterioration,

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

and thence attains to eternal Brahma that is so difficult of
acquisition. <span id="fr_884"></span>[1](#fn_884.md) Thus, Of thou of
great might, I have discoursed to thee of the eminence of Narayana!'

"Vritra said, 'These words of thine, I see, perfectly according with the
truth. Indeed, when this is so, I have no (cause of grief). Having
listened to thy words, O thou of great powers of mind, I have become
freed from sorrow and sin of every kind. O illustrious *Rishi*, O holy
one, I see this wheel of Time, endued with mighty energy, of the most
effulgent and Infinite Vishnu, has been set in motion. Eternal is that
station, from which all kinds of creation spring. That Vishnu is the
Supreme Soul. He is the foremost of Beings. In Him this entire universe
rests.'

"Bhishma continued, 'Having said these words, O son of Kunti, Vritra
cast off his life-breaths, uniting his soul (in Yoga, with the supreme
Soul), and attained to the highest station.'

"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, whether this Janardana
(Krishna) is that illustrious and puissant Lord of whom Sanatkumara
spoke unto Vritra in days of old.'

"Bhishma said, 'The Highest Deity, endued with the six attributes of
(puissance, etc.) is at the Root. Staying there, the Supreme Soul, with
his own energy, creates all these diverse existent things. <span
id="fr_885"></span>[2](#fn_885.md) Know that this Kesava who knows no
deterioration is from His eighth portion. Endued with the highest
Intelligence, it is this Kesava who creates the three worlds with an
eighth portion (of His energy). Coming immediately after Him who lies at
the Root, this Kesava who is eternal (compared with all other existent
things), changes at the end of each Kalpa. He, however, who lies at the
Root and who is endued with supreme might and puissance, lies in the
waters when universal destruction comes (in the form of the potential
Seed of all things). Kesava is that Creator of pure Soul who courseth
through all the eternal worlds. <span id="fr_886"></span>[3](#fn_886.md)
Infinite and Eternal as He is, He fills all space (with emanations from
Himself) and courseth through the universe (in the form of everything
that constitutes the universe). Freed as He is from limitations of every
kind such as the possession of attributes would imply, he suffers
himself to be invested

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

with Avidya and awakened to Consciousness, Kesava of Supreme Soul
creates all things. In Him rests this wondrous universe in its
entirety.'

"Yudhishthira said, 'O thou that art conversant with the highest object
of knowledge, I think that Vritra saw beforehand the excellent end that
awaited him. It is for this, O grandsire, that he was happy and did not
yield to grief (in view of his coming Death). He who is White of hue,
who has taken birth in a pure or stainless race, and who has attained to
the rank of a Sadhya, doth not, O sinless one, come back (into the world
for re-birth). Such a person, O grandsire, is freed from both hell and
the status of all intermediate creatures. He, however, who has attained
to either the Yellow or the Red hue, is seen sometimes to be overwhelmed
by Tamas and fall among the order of Intermediate creatures. As regards
ourselves, we are exceedingly afflicted and attached to objects that are
productive of sorrow or indifference or joy. Alas, what will the end be
to which we shall attain? Will it be the Blue or the Dark which is the
lowest of all hues?'

"Bhishma continued, 'Ye are Pandavas. Ye have been born in a stainless
race. Ye are of rigid vows. Having sported in joy in the regions of the
gods, ye shall come back to the world of men. Living happily as long as
the creation lasts, all of you at the next new creation will be admitted
among the gods, and enjoying all kinds of felicities ye will at last be
numbered among the Siddhas. Let no fear be yours. Be you cheerful.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_853"></span>[295:1](m12b107.htm#fr_853.md) *Vaya* acts are, of
course, sacrifices and other religious acts; by *abhyantara* acts are
meant *santi*, *danti*, *uparati*, *titiksha*, and *samadhi*, *i.e.*,
the usual course of mental training necessary for Yoga. What the speaker
intends to lay down in this verse is that sacrifices are not entirely
useless. These may lead to *chitta-suddhi* or the cleansing of the
heart, which, when <span id="page_296">p. 296</span> attained, leads to
knowledge of Him or the Soul or to Emancipation or Infinity.

<span id="fn_854"></span>[296:1](m12b107.htm#fr_854.md) The comparison lies
in the fact of the desirability of the two acts. No one likes the stains
the body may catch to remain unwashed or unwiped off. Similarly, no one
should neglect to wash off the faults that the heart may catch. There is
no comparison between the two acts with regard to the degree of effort
necessary to accomplish each.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[296:2](m12b107.htm#fr_855.md) 'Efforts born of
practice' refer to both external and internal *Sadhana*.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[296:3](m12b107.htm#fr_856.md) *Karmaviseshan* is
explained by the commentator as equivalent to *ragaviraga-hetun*.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[296:4](m12b107.htm#fr_857.md) *Sampravartante*
and *tishthanti* are thus explained by the commentator.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[296:5](m12b107.htm#fr_858.md) In the previous
verses the speaker describes the training that one should undergo. In
this and the following ones, he speaks of the object to be known.
*Sreeman* is explained as *asriyate iti srih*, *i.e.*, *upadhih*,
*tadvan*. *Hari* is *Sambharata*. *Narayana* is *saravasrayah*. *Prabhu*
is *sarvaniyanta*. *Deva* is *dyotate-iti* *i.e.*, *Chinmatrah*. These
etymologies must be grasped for understanding this verse.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[296:6](m12b107.htm#fr_859.md) The 'mutable' in
all creatures is the combination of the five primal essences. The
'immutable' in them is Jiva, or Chit as invested with ignorance. The
eleven modifications that constitute. His essence are the eleven senses
of knowledge and action with the mind. Equipped with these eleven. He
drinketh the universe, *i.e.*, enjoys it. The rays are these senses
themselves. Equipped with the senses. He enjoys the universe with the
senses.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[297:1](m12b107.htm#fr_860.md) 'His mind is *in*
the Moon.' *i.e.*, His mind is the Moon. The expression 'waters in the
Ganges,' implies a distinction that does not exist between container and
contained, for 'Ganges,' means the water so named.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[297:2](m12b107.htm#fr_861.md) The *sandhi*
between *sa* and *acramanam* is *arsha*.

<span id="fn_862"></span>[297:3](m12b107.htm#fr_862.md) *Dharma* has
various meanings all of which, however, are closely created with one
another. As duty, or the assemblage of all acts which we should do, it
is both Righteousness and Religion.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[297:4](m12b107.htm#fr_863.md) The Sacrificial
*grahas* or *patras* (vessels) are called after the names of the deities
Indra, Vayu, Soma, etc. The sixteen Ritwijes are Brahman, Hotri,
Adhyaryu, Udgatri, etc.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[297:5](m12b107.htm#fr_864.md) Verse 21 to 23 show
the unity of the Divine Being. The variety perceived is only apparent,
not real.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[297:6](m12b107.htm#fr_865.md) Verse 31 and 32 are
not difficult; yet the Burdwan translator makes nonsense of the same.

<span id="fn_866"></span>[298:1](m12b107.htm#fr_866.md) This is elaborated
in the *Vishnu Purana*, Part I, Sec. V. There are three primary
creations, *viz*., *Mahat*, the five primal essences in their subtile
forms and the senses. From the Six colours again six other creations
have sprung. To the Dark colour is due all immobile creatures; to the
Tawny all the intermediate order of creatures (*viz*., the lower animals
and birds, etc.); to the Blue are due human beings, to the Red the
Prajapatyas; to the Yellow the deities; and to the White are due the
Kumara, *i.e.*, Sanatkumara and others.

<span id="fn_867"></span>[298:2](m12b107.htm#fr_867.md) Emancipation is so
difficult.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[298:3](m12b107.htm#fr_868.md) The construction of
the first line is this: *subham darsanam* (auspicious scriptures)
*gatwa* (prapya) *Devah yam gatim* (identical with) *darsanam*
(atmanubhavatmikam) *aha*, *Gati* is naturally dependent on *Varna*, and
*Varna* upon 'Time or acts.'

<span id="fn_869"></span>[298:4](m12b107.htm#fr_869.md) There are ten
senses of knowledge and action. To this must be added Manas, Buddhi,
Ahankara and Chitta, which are sometimes called the four *Karanas*. In
consequence of these fourteen, fourteen different kinds or merit and
demerit may be achieved by Jiva who is their possessor. These fourteen
kinds of merit and demerit also, are subdivided into hundreds of
thousands each. Jiva, in course of his wanderings through the universe,
ascends in the scale of Being, stays in particular rungs, and falls down
from them into lower rungs, accordingly, What the speaker wishes to
inculcate is that these fourteen should always be towards the attribute
of *Sattwa* or Goodness.

<span id="fn_870"></span>[298:5](m12b107.htm#fr_870.md) This life, it
should be noted, leadeth to Jiva's transformation as an immobile object.
A creature of Dark hue becomes addicted to wicked acts and rots in hell
His existence as an immobile object is hell itself.

<span id="fn_871"></span>[299:1](m12b107.htm#fr_871.md) *Prajavisargah* is
the period for which one Creation lasts, being equal to what is called a
Kalpa.

<span id="fn_872"></span>[299:2](m12b107.htm#fr_872.md) The Dark and the
Tawny hues of their corresponding states of existence, *viz*., the
immobile and the intermediate, are regarded as states of endurance.
Hence, when the misery that is their portion has been fully endured, the
recollection is suddenly irradiated into the mind, of the righteousness
that distinguished Jiva in ages far remote. *Anisa* is helpless or
cheerless.

<span id="fn_873"></span>[299:3](m12b107.htm#fr_873.md) *Cha* at the end of
the second line is equivalent to *va*. Unless *cha* be taken as
equivalent to *va* the verse would yield no meaning. After Tawny comes
Blue, *i.e.*, after attainment of existence as an Intermediate creature
Jiva attains to humanity. This occurs when Sattwa does not predominate.
Hence *anyatha* should be supplied after *upaiti*.

<span id="fn_874"></span>[299:4](m12b107.htm#fr_874.md) *Vyatite* is a
finite verb in indicative mood, as pointed out by the commentator. It
comes from root *i* with suffix *vi*. After *sate* supply *jate sati*.
The Burdwan translator takes it as a participial adjective in the
locative singular, which is, of course, wrong. The version he gives of
this line is most ridiculous, containing as it does a self-contradictory
assertion. K. P. Singha gives the right meaning.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[299:5](m12b107.htm#fr_875.md) When Jiva becomes a
Deva, he has still the ten senses, the five *Pranas*, and the four
internal possessions of mind, understanding, Chitta, and Ahankara,
amounting in all to nineteen. These nineteen impel him to thousands of
acts. Hence, even when transformed into Deva, Jiva is *not* freed from
acts, but is in *niraya* or hell,--acts being, under all circumstances,
equivalent to hell.

<span id="fn_876"></span>[300:1](m12b107.htm#fr_876.md) *Vyuha* implies the
varied forms of one and the same thing *Daivani* in *Sattwa-pradhanani*.
The five senses, with the mind, the understanding form a total of seven.
The acts achieved through each of these may be subdivided a hundredfold.
As these seven possessions adhere to Jiva till he becomes emancipated,
he acts through these seven in a variety of ways, Relying, therefore,
upon these seven hundred kinds of acts (which are but varied forms of
one and the same thing, *viz*., Action), Jiva successively becomes Red
and Yellow and White. Arrived at White, he courses through certain
highly effulgent regions which are superior to the region of Brahman
himself, and which leave behind or beneath them the Eight *Puris* (by
which, perhaps, is meant the *puri* of Indra, that of Varuna, etc., or,
Kasi, Mathura, Maya, etc., or symbolical stages of progress, which are
fraught with great felicity). Those highly effulgent and adorable
regions are obtainable by Knowledge alone or the fruit of Yoga.

<span id="fn_877"></span>[300:2](m12b107.htm#fr_877.md) This is an
exceedingly abstruse verse. The Burdwan version, in which unconnected
bits of the commentary have been jumbled together, is utter nonsense.
K.P. Singha skips over nearly the whole verse. The Eight *puris*
referred to in the previous verse are here stated to be identical with
the Sixty well-known incidents of even Sukla or White existence. This
tale of Sixty is arrived at in this way: 1st, the state of wakefulness;
2nd, the gross body made up of the five primal essences; 3rd, the five
attributes of sound, scent, form, taste, and touch; these come up to
seven. Then come the ten senses of action and knowledge; the five
breaths; mind, understanding, consciousness, and chitta: these form 19.
Then come Avidya, Kama, and Karma. With Soul or the Beholder, the sum
comes up to 30. The number becomes doubled when the state of Dream is
taken into consideration, for like Wakefulness existing with the 29,
Dream also exists with the 29. With those that are effulgent, *i.e.*,
with Beings that are Sukla or White, these 60 are simply
*mano-viruddhani* or *manomatrani* eva. Unlike other Beings in lower
spheres of existence, they that are effulgent or Sukla do not regard the
states of Wakefulness and Dream as different but as the same. Hence, the
*para gati* of such Beings is a state of existence that transcends both
Wakefulness and Dream, and transcends Dreamless slumber also (for in
Dreamless slumber the 30 exist suspended, to be revived with the return
of wakefulness), and is identical with the fourth state called Turiya.

<span id="fn_878"></span>[301:1](m12b107.htm#fr_878.md) What the speaker
wishes to lay down here is that even he that is *Jivanmukta* or has
achieved his Emancipation though living like other, is incapable of
transcending the effects of his past acts. Every kind of existence or
life (save that which is identical with Brahma) is *anistha* or
[inauspiciousness](errata.htm#126.md). That *Yogin* who is *Jivan-mukta*
but who is not able to cast off the felicities of Yoga-puissance,
resides in one and the same body for a full century of Kalpas, in a
superior form of life, and after the expiry, of that century of Kalpas,
he passes through four other regions named *Mahar*, *Jana*, *Tapas*, and
*Satya*. Now, *this* is the end of such a Yogin, who, of course, belongs
to the sixth colour which is White, and who is freed from attachments
and who is unsuccessful though successful, *i.e.*, who has achieved
Yoga-success but who has not still been able to achieve that success
which consists in beholding Brahma or *Brahma-sakshatkara*. By *anisah*
in this verse is meant that Yogin who is incapable of casting off the
felicities brought about by Yoga-puissance. K.P. Singha gives the
substance of the verse not very accurately. The Burdwan translator, in
the version he gives, introduces three nominatives in the three
sentences into which he splits it, *viz*., Jiva, the Yogin who is unable
to cast off the felicities brought about by Yoga-puissance, and the
Yogin who has achieved *Brahma-sakshatkara*, without understanding that
all three refer to one and the same person.

<span id="fn_879"></span>[301:2](m12b107.htm#fr_879.md) *Anisah* here means
one who, after having attained to eminence by Yoga, falls off from Yoga.
*Tatra* means heaven or the superior regions that are his in consequence
of Yoga-eminence. For a century of Kalpas such a person has to dwell in
heaven, with the unexhausted remnant of his senses, *i.e.*, the senses
of knowledge with mind and understanding, being always predisposed
towards the attribute of *Sattwa*. Upon the expiry of that century of
Kalpas, such a person, without ascending, descends to the world of men,
but then here eminence of station becomes his.

<span id="fn_880"></span>[301:3](m12b107.htm#fr_880.md) *Saptakritwah* is
seven times. *Paraiti* is 'courseth through.' *Lokah* refers to the
seven regions called respectively, *Bhur*, *Bhuvar*, *Sivah*, *Mahar*,
*Jana*, *Tapas*, and *Satya* (or Brahmaloka). What is intended to be
said here is this: If the Yogin, having attained to only the first stage
of Yoga, dies, he ascends to heaven. Thence failing down on Earth, he
becomes an Emperor and thus conquers the Earth or *Bhu*. In this way, as
the Yogin gradually ascends in the path of Yoga, he ascends higher and
higher. In this verse *Sambarevikshepa* has been used to signify
*Samadhi* and awakening from *Samadhi*, for in the first the universe is
destroyed, and in the second it is re-created. At the end, he reaches
the region of *Satya* or *Brahma*. Thence even he has to return if he
has not been able to achieve *Brahma-sakshatkara*.

<span id="fn_881"></span>[302:1](m12b107.htm#fr_881.md) The seven that the
Yogin desirous of Emancipation casts off are either the seven regions
already referred to *viz*., *Bhu*, *Bhuva*, *Swah*, *Maha*, *Jana*,
*Tapa*, and *Satya*, or the five senses of knowledge with mind and
understanding. *Samharam* is equivalent to *Samhritya*, having been
formed by the suffix *namul*. *Upaplavoni* are sources of grief or
misfortune. The first *Devasya* refers to Mahadeva. The Saivas call that
region Kailasa. The Vaishnavas call it Vaikuntha. The *Hiranya-garbhas*
call it Brahman's or *Brahmaloka*. Sesha is Ananta, a particular form of
Narayana. They who call it the region of Nara are, of course, the
Sankhyas, for these regard Emancipation as the goal of Jiva or every
creature. The *Devasya vishnoh* (in the third line) is *Dyotamanasya
Brahmanah* *i.e.*, *Chinmatrasya*, or of the pure Chit when uninvested
with ignorance or Avidya. The Aupanishadas regard it as the region of
Para-Brahma. The commentator clearly points out what the seven regions
are. K.P. Singha, misunderstanding the verse, mentions only five; the
Burdwan translator six.

<span id="fn_882"></span>[302:2](m12b107.htm#fr_882.md) This verse is not
at all difficult; yet the Burdwan translator makes utter nonsense of it.
K.P. Singha gives the substance of the first line, but skips over the
second. Without giving a literal version of the first line, I expand it,
following the lead of the commentator.

<span id="fn_883"></span>[302:3](m12b107.htm#fr_883.md) *Sa* here indicates
the person conversant with Brahma. The construction is *Sa yavat
saseshabhuk asti tavat prajah tathaiva te sukle dyvyau cha tadangeshu*
(vartante). *Etat* in the second line is this *paridrisyamanam
viyadadi*. What the speaker wishes to inculcate in this verse is that
unto one conversant with Brahma, the whole universe up to complete
identity with Brahma is as contiguous as a plum in the palm of the hand.
When the Chitta is cleansed by Yoga as practised by *Dhyana*, *Dharana*,
and *Samadhis*, then the perceptible universe appears to him as
identical with his own senses. The two white sciences referred to are
*Paravidya* and *Aparavidya*, *i.e.*, all knowledge including that of
Brahma.

<span id="fn_884"></span>[303:1](m12b107.htm#fr_884.md) *Suddhena
manasa*,--with cleansed mind, *i.e.*, with the aid of *Sarvana*
(hearing), *Manana* (attention), *Dhyana* (contemplation), and *Abhyasa*
(repeated meditation). Two stages are indicated in this verse. The first
is the attention of the *suddham* and *paramam gatim* or the stainless
and high end. This is equivalent to *Brahma-sakshatkara*. After this
comes the second stage, which is the *avayam sthanam* or the spot which
knows no deterioration, *i.e.*, Emancipation. This is identical with the
attainment of Eternal Brahma which is *dushprapyam* or difficult of
attainment.

<span id="fn_885"></span>[303:2](m12b107.htm#fr_885.md) The commentator
says that the object of this verse is to inculcate the Impersonality of
God. God is at the Root of all things, *i.e.*, (as the commentator
supposes according to the teaching of the Vedanta philosophy). He exists
in His own unmodified nature, even as pure Chit. Both *Vidya*
(Knowledge) and *Avidya* (Ignorance or illusion) exist in Him. In
consequence of the latter he is *Bhagavan*, *i.e.*, endued with the six
grand attributes of puissance, etc.

<span id="fn_886"></span>[303:3](m12b107.htm#fr_886.md) In the form of all
things,--causes and effects-which constitute them.
