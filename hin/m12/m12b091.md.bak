### SECTION CCLXIV

"Tuladhara said, 'See with thy own eyes, O Jajali, who, *viz*., those
that are good or those that are otherwise, have adopted this path of
duty that I have spoken of. Thou shalt then understand properly how the
truth stands. Behold, many birds are hovering in the
[sky](errata.htm#105.md). Amongst them are those that were reared on thy
head, as also many hawks and many others of other species. Behold, O
Brahmana, those birds have contracted their wings and legs for entering
their respective nests. Summon them, O regenerate one! There those
birds, treated with affection by thee, are displaying their love for
thee that art their father. Without doubt, thou art their father, O
Jajali! Do thou summon thy children.'

"Bhishma continued, 'Then those birds, summoned by Jajali, made answer
agreeably to the dictates of that religion which is not fraught with
injury to any creature. <span id="fr_688"></span>[2](#fn_688.md) All acts
that are done without injuring any creature become serviceable (to the
doer) both here and hereafter. Those acts, however, that involve injury
to others, destroy faith, and faith being destroyed, involves the
destroyer in ruin. The sacrifices of those that regard acquisition and
non-acquisition in the same light, that are endued with faith that are
self-restrained, that have tranquil minds, and that perform sacrifices
from a sense of duty (and not from desire of fruit), become productive
of fruit. <span id="fr_689"></span>[3](#fn_689.md) Faith with respect to
Brahma is the daughter of Surya, O regenerate one. She is the
protectress and she is the giver of good birth. Faith is superior to the
merit born of (Vedic) recitations and meditation. <span
id="fr_690"></span>[4](#fn_690.md) An act vitiated by defect of speech is
saved by Faith. An act vitiated by defect of mind is saved by Faith. But

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

neither speech nor mind can save an act that is vitiated by want of
Faith. <span id="fr_691"></span>[1](#fn_691.md) Men conversant with the
[occurrences](errata.htm#106.md) of the past recite in this connection the
following verse sung by Brahman. The offerings in sacrifices of a person
that is pure (in body and acts) but wanting in Faith, and of another
that is impure (in respect of their worthiness of acceptance). The food,
again, of a person conversant with the Vedas but miserly in behaviour,
and that of a usurer that is liberal in conduct, <span
id="fr_692"></span>[2](#fn_692.md) the deities after careful consideration,
had held to be equal (in respect of their worthiness of acceptance).
The' Supreme Lord of all creatures (*viz*., Brahman) then told them that
they had committed an error. The food of a liberal person is sanctified
by Faith. The food, however, of the person that is void of Faith is lost
in consequence of such want of Faith. The food of a liberal usurer is
acceptable but not the food of a miser. <span
id="fr_693"></span>[3](#fn_693.md) Only one person in the world, *viz*., he
that is bereft of Faith, is unfit to make offerings to the deities. The
food of only such a man is unfit to be eaten. This is the opinion of men
conversant with duties. Want of Faith is a high sin. Faith is a cleanser
of sins. Like a snake casting off its slough, the man of Faith succeeds
in casting off all his sin. The religion of abstention with Faith is
superior to all things considered sacred. Abstaining from all faults of
behaviour, he who betakes himself to Faith, becomes sanctified. What
need hath such a person of penances, or of conduct, or of endurance?
Every man has Faith. Faith, however, is of three kinds, *viz*., as
affected by Sattwa, by Rajas and by Tamas, and according to the kind of
Faith that one has, one is named. Persons endued with goodness and
possessed of insight into the true import of morality have thus laid
down the subject of duties. We have, as the result of our enquiries, got
all this from the sage Dharmadarsana. O thou of great wisdom, betake
thyself to Faith, for thou shalt then obtain that which is superior. He
who has Faith (in the declarations of the *Srutis*), and who acts
according to their import (in the belief that they are good for him), is
certainly of righteous soul. O Jajali, he who adheres to his own path
(under the influence of Faith) is certainly a superior person.'

"Bhishma continued, 'After a short while, Tuladhara and Jajali, both of
whom had been endued with great wisdom, ascended to heaven and sported

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

there in great happiness, <span id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_694.md) having
reached their respective places earned by their respective acts. Many
truths of this kind were spoken of by Tuladhara. That eminent person
understood this religion (of abstention from injury) completely. These
eternal duties were accordingly proclaimed by him. The regenerate
Jajali, O son of Kunti, having heard these words of celebrated energy,
betook himself to tranquillity. In this way, many truths of grave import
were uttered by Tuladhara, illustrated by examples for instruction. What
other truths dost thou wish to hear?'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_688"></span>[243:2](m12b091.htm#fr_688.md) *Dharmasya vachanat
kila* is explained by the commentator as *Dharmasya ahinsatmakasya
samvandhino vachanat*. I think the words may also mean, 'obeying the
voice of Dharma.'

<span id="fn_689"></span>[243:3](m12b091.htm#fr_689.md) The two negatives
in the second line amount to an affirmative assertion.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[243:4](m12b091.htm#fr_690.md) *Vaivaswati* is
'appertaining to Vivaswat or *prakasarapachidatma*', hence
'*Brahma-vishayini*. 'Daughter of Surya' means *Sattwiki*. Faith is
*vahirvangamanasi*, *i.e.*, is 'the outward form of speech and mind,'
implying that it 'transcends (the merit born of) speech (recitation) and
mind (meditation).'

<span id="fn_691"></span>[244:1](m12b091.htm#fr_691.md) 'Defects of speech'
are the incorrect utterance of *mantras*. 'Defects of mind' are such as
listlessness, haste, etc.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[244:2](m12b091.htm#fr_692.md) *Kadarya* is
explained by the commentator as 'miserly.' I think it may be taken also
in a more extended sense. Then again *vardhushi* is a usurer and not
necessarily a dealer in corn.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[244:3](m12b091.htm#fr_693.md) The commentator is
entirely silent upon this verse. The two Bengali versions have proceeded
in two different ways. The four classes of persons indicated in the
previous verses are (1) he that is destitute of faith but is (outwardly)
pure, (2) he that has faith but is not (outwardly) pure, (3) a miserly
person possessed of learning, and (4) a usurer endued with liberality.
The answer of Brahman, without touching other points, refers
particularly to faith. The liberal man's food is sanctified by faith.
The food of him that has no faith is lost. For this reason, the liberal
man's food, even if he happens to be a usurer, is worthy of acceptance,
and not so the food of the miser even though he may be possessed of
Vedic lore.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[245:1](m12b091.htm#fr_694.md) The commentator
takes the word *divam* as implying *hardakasam*. They sported (not in
the ordinary felicity of heaven but) in the puissance of Yoga.
