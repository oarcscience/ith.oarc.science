### SECTION XIII

"Sahadeva said, 'By casting off all external objects only, O Bharata,
one does not attain to success. By casting off even mental attachments,
the attainment of success is doubtful. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) Let that religious merit and that
happiness which are his who has cast off external objects but whose mind
still internally covets them, be the portion of our foes! On the other
hand, let that religious merit and that happiness which are his who
governs the earth, having cast off all internal attachments also, be the
portion of our friends. The word *mama* (mine), consisting of two
letters, is Death's self; white the opposite word *na-mama* (not mine),
consisting of three letters, is eternal *Brahma*. <span
id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29.md) *Brahma* and death, O king, entering
invisibly into every soul, without doubt, cause all creatures to act. If
this being, O Bharata, that is called Soul, be not ever subject to
destruction, then by destroying the bodies of creatures one cannot be
guilty of slaughter. If, on the other hand, the soul and the body of a
being are born or destroyed together, so that when the body is destroyed
the soul also is destroyed, then the way (prescribed in the scriptures)
of rites and acts would be futile. Therefore, driving away all doubts
about the immortality of the soul, the man of intelligence should adopt
that path which has been trodden by the righteous of old and older
times. The life of that king is certainly fruitless who having acquired
the entire earth with her mobile and immobile creatures, does not enjoy
her. As regards the man again who lives in the forest upon wild fruits
and roots, but whose attachment to things of the earth has not ceased,
such a one, O king, lives within the jaws of Death. Behold, O Bharata,
the hearts and the outward forms of all creatures to be but
manifestations of thy own. They that look upon all creatures as their
own selves escape from the great fear (of destruction). <span
id="fr_30"></span>[3](#fn_30.md) Thou art my sire, thou art my protector,
thou art my brother, and thou art my senior and preceptor. It behoveth
thee, therefore, to forgive these incoherent utterances in sorrow of a
woe-stricken person. True or false, this that has been uttered by are, O
lord of earth, has been uttered from a due regard for thee, O best of
Bharatas, that I entertain!"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_28"></span>[22:1](m12a013.htm#fr_28.md) *Sariram* is
contra-distinguished from *Vahyam*. The first is explained as
appertaining to or encased in *Sarira*, *i.e.*, the mind.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[22:2](m12a013.htm#fr_29.md) What Sahadeva wishes
to say is that everything proceeds from selfishness is productive of
death, while everything proceeding from an opposite frame of mind leads
to *Brahma* or immortality.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[22:3](m12a013.htm#fr_30.md) The meaning entirely
depends upon the word *Swabhavam*, manifestation of self. In the second
line, if *Vrittam* be read for *Bhutam* the sense would remain
unaltered.
