### SECTION CXCVIII

"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me what description of hell is obtained by a
Reciter? I feel, O king, a curiosity to know this. It behoveth thee to
discourse on the subject.'

"Bhishma said, 'Thou hast sprung from a portion of the god of
righteousness. Thou art by nature observant of righteousness. Listen, O
sinless one, with undivided attention, to these words resting on
righteousness as their basis. Those regions that are owned by the
high-souled gods, that are of diverse aspects and colours, of diverse
descriptions and productive of diverse fruits, and that are of great
excellence, those ears again that: move at the will of the riders, those
beautiful mansions and hells, those various pleasure-gardens embellished
with golden lotuses, those regions that belong to the four Regents and
Sukra and Vrihaspati and the Maruts and Viswedevas and Sadhyas and the
Aswins, and the Rudras and the Adityas and the Vasus, and other denizens
of heaven, are, O sire, spoken of as hells, when compared with the
region of the Supreme Soul. The region last spoken of is without any
fear (of change for the worse), uncreate (and therefore, in its true
nature), without pain of any kind (such as ignorance and delusion),
without any agreeable or disagreeable element, beyond the reach of the
three attributes (of *Sattwa*, *Rajas*, and *Tamas*), freed from the
eight incidents, (*viz*., the five primal elements, the senses, the:
mind, and the intellect), without the three (distinctions

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

between the knower, the known, and act of knowing); freed also from the
four attributes (seeing, hearing, thinking, and knowing), <span
id="fr_133"></span>[1](m12b026.htm#fn_133.md) without the fourfold causes
(of knowledge), without joy and delight and sorrow and disease. Time (in
his forms of past, present, and future) arises there for use. Time is
not the ruler there. That supreme region is the ruler of Time as also of
Heaven. That Reciter who becomes identified with his Soul (by
withdrawing everything into it) goes thither. He has, after this, never
to feel any sorrow. This region is called Supreme. The other regions (of
which I have first spoken) are hell. I have not told thee of all those
regions that are called hell. Indeed, in comparison with that foremost
of regions all the others are called hell.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_131"></span>[55:1](m12b024.htm#fr_131.md) in the Bengal texts
there is a vicious line beginning with *Prajna*, etc, The Bombay text
omits it, making both 10 and 11 couplets, instead of taking 11 as a
triplet.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[55:2](m12b024.htm#fr_132.md) *Na samyuktah* is
explained by the commentator as *aviraktopi hathena tyaktabhogah*.
