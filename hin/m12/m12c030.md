### SECTION CCCXXXI

"'Narada said, By listening to such scriptures as are blessed, as bring
about tranquillity, as dispel grief, and as are productive of happiness,
one attains to (a pure) understanding, and having attained to it obtains
to high 'felicity. A thousand causes of sorrow, a hundred causes of
fear, from day to day, afflict one that is destitute of understanding,
but not one that is possessed of wisdom and learning. Do thou,
therefore, listen to some old narratives as I recite them to you, for
the object of dispelling thy griefs. If one can subjugate one's
understanding, one is sure to attain to happiness. By association of
what is undesirable and dissociation from what is agreeable, only men of
little intelligence, become subject to mental sorrow of every kind. When
things have become past, one should not grieve, thinking of their
merits. He that thinks of such past things with affection can never
emancipate himself. One should always seek to find out the faults of
those things to which one begins to become attached. One should always
regard such things to be fraught with much evil. By doing so, one should
soon free oneself therefrom. The man who grieves for what is past fails
to acquire either wealth or religious merit or fame.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

\[paragraph continues\] That which exists no longer cannot be obtained.
When such things pass away, they do not return (however keen the regret
one may indulge in for their sake). Creatures sometimes acquire and
sometimes lose worldly object. No man in this world can be grieved by
all the events that fall upon him. Dead or lost, he who grieves for what
is past, only gets sorrow for sorrow. Instead of one sorrow, he gets
two. <span id="fr_178"></span>[1](#fn_178.md) Those men who, beholding the
course of life and death in the world with the aid of their
intelligence, do not shed tears, are said to behold properly. Such
persons have never to shed tears, (at anything that may happen). When
any such calamity comes, productive of either physical or mental grief,
as is incapable of being warded off by even one's best efforts, one
should cease to reflect on it with sorrow. This is the medicine for
sorrow, *viz*., not to think of it. By thinking of it, one can never
dispel it; on the other hand, by thinking upon sorrow, one only enhances
it. Mental griefs should be killed by wisdom; while physical grief
should be dispelled by medicines. This is the power of knowledge. One
should not, in such matters, behave like men of little understandings.
Youth, beauty, life, stored wealth, health, association with those that
are loved,--these all are exceedingly transitory. One possessed of
wisdom should never covet them. One should not lament individually for a
sorrowful occurrence that concerns an entire community. Instead of
indulgence in it when grief comes, one should seek to avert it and apply
a remedy as soon as one sees the opportunity for doing it. There is no
doubt that in this life the measure of misery is much greater than that
of [happiness](errata.htm#179.md). There is no doubt in this that all men
show attachment for objects of the senses and that death is regarded as
disagreeable. That man who casts off both joy and sorrow, is said to
attain to Brahma. When such a man departs from this world, men of wisdom
never indulge in any sorrow on his account. In spending wealth there is
pain. In protecting it there is pain. In acquiring it there is pain.
Hence, when one's wealth meets with destruction, one should not indulge
in any sorrow for it. Men of little understanding, attaining to
different grades of wealth, fail to win contentment and at last perish
in misery. Men of wisdom, however, are always contented. All
combinations are destined to end in dissolution. All things that are
high are destined to fall down and become low. Union is sure to end in
disunion anti life is certain to end in death. Thirst is unquenchable.
Contentment is the highest happiness. Hence, persons of wisdom regard
contentment to be the most precious wealth. One's allotted period of
life is running continually. It stops not in its course for even a
single moment. When one's body itself is not durable, what other thing
is there (in this world) that one should reckon as durable? Those
persons who, reflecting on the nature of all creatures and concluding
that it is beyond the grasp of the mind, turn their attention to the
highest path, and, setting out, achieve a

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

fair progress in it, have not to indulge in sorrow. <span
id="fr_179"></span>[1](#fn_179.md) Like a tiger seizing and running away
with its prey, Death seizes and runs away with the man that is employed
in such (unprofitable) occupation and that is still unsatiated with
objects of desire and enjoyment. One should always seek to emancipate
oneself from sorrow. One should seek to dispel sorrow by beginning one's
operations with cheerfulness, that is, without indulging in sorrow the
while, having freed oneself from a particular sorrow, one should act in
such a way as to keep sorrow at a distance by abstaining from all faults
of conduct. <span id="fr_180"></span>[2](#fn_180.md) The rich and the poor
alike find nothing in sound and touch and form and scent and taste,
after the immediate enjoyment thereof. <span
id="fr_181"></span>[3](#fn_181.md) Before union, creatures are never
subject to sorrow. Hence, one that has not fallen off from one's
original nature, never indulges in sorrow when that union comes to an
end. <span id="fr_182"></span>[4](#fn_182.md) One should restrain one's
sexual appetite and the stomach with the aid of patience. One should
protect one's hands and feet with the aid of the eye. One's eyes and
ears and the other senses should be protected by the mind. One's mind
and speech should be ruled with the aid of wisdom. Casting off love and
affection for persons that are known as well as for those that are
unknown, one should conduct oneself with humility. Such a person is said
to be possessed of wisdom, and such a one surely finds happiness. That
man who is pleased with his own Soul <span
id="fr_183"></span>[5](#fn_183.md) who is devoted to Yoga, who depends upon
nothing out of self, who is without cupidity, and who conducts himself
without the assistance of anything but his self, succeeds in attaining
to felicity.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_178"></span>[103:1](m12c030.htm#fr_178.md) Sorrow increases by
indulgence.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[104:1](m12c030.htm#fr_179.md) This is a very
doubtful verse. The commentator is silent. I follow the meaning as it
lies on the surface. The object of the verse seems to be this: there are
men that are employed in reflecting upon the nature of things: these
should know that such occupation is useless, for truly the nature of
things is beyond the grasp of the mind. The greatest philosopher is
ignorant of all the virtues of a blade of grass, the purpose for which
it exists, the changes that it undergoes every instant of time and from
day to day. Those men, however, who have such unprofitable occupation
for walking along the highest path (the path, that is, which leads to
*Brahma*) free themselves from grief.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[104:2](m12c030.htm#fr_180.md) I am not sure that
I have understood this verse correctly.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[104:3](m12c030.htm#fr_181.md) What is intended to
be said is that the gratification of the senses leaves nothing behind.
The pleasure lasts as long as the contact continues of the objects with
the senses. The Burdwan translator, not suspecting that the word used is
*adhana*, gives a ridiculous version.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[104:4](m12c030.htm#fr_182.md) What is said here
is this: a man has spouses and children, or wealth, etc.: there was no
sorrow when these were not: with his union with these his sorrow
commences. Hence, when these things disappear, an intelligent man should
not indulge in any sorrow. Bonds or attachments are always productive of
grief. When bonds are severed or destroyed, there ought to be no grief.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[104:5](m12c030.htm#fr_183.md) *i.e.*, whose
pleasures do not depend upon external objects such as spouses and
children.
