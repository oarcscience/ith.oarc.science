### SECTION CCXXXIX

"Bhishma said, 'Thus addressed (by his sire), Suka, highly applauding
these instructions of the great *Rishi*, set himself about asking the
following, question relating to the import of duties that lead to
Emancipation.'

"Suka said, 'By what means doth one possessed of wisdom, conversant with
the Vedas, observant of sacrifices, endued with wisdom, and free from
malice, succeed in attaining to *Brahma* which is incapable of being
apprehended by either direct evidence or inference, and unsusceptible of
being indicated by the Vedas? Asked by me, tell me by what means is
*Brahma* to be apprehended? Is it by penance, by Brahmacharya, by
renunciation of everything, by intelligence, by the aid of the Sankhya
philosophy, or by Yoga? By what means may what kind of singleness of
purpose be attained by men, with respect to both, *viz*., the mind and
the senses? It behoveth thee to expound all this to me.' <span
id="fr_449"></span>[4](#fn_449.md)

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

"Vyasa said, 'No man ever attains to success by means other than the
acquisition of knowledge, the practice of penances, the subjugation of
the senses, and renunciation of everything. <span
id="fr_450"></span>[1](#fn_450) The great entities (five in number.md)
represent the first (or initial) creation of the Self-born. They have
been very largely placed in embodied creatures included in the world of
life. <span id="fr_451"></span>[2](#fn_451.md) The bodies of all embodied
creatures are derived from earth. The humours are from water. Their eyes
are said to be derived from light. Prana, Apana (and the three other
vital breaths) have the wind for their refuge. And, lastly, all
unoccupied apertures within them (such as the nostrils, the cavities of
the ear, etc.) are of Space. In the feet (of living creatures) is
Vishnu. In their arms is Indra. Within the stomach is Agni desirous of
eating. In the ears are the points of the horizon (or the compass)
representing the sense of hearing. In the tongue is speech which is
Saraswati. <span id="fr_452"></span>[3](#fn_452.md) The ears, skin, eyes,
tongue and nose forming the fifth, are said to be the sense of
knowledge. These exist for the purposes of apprehension of their
respective objects. Sound, touch, form, taste and scent forming the
fifth, are the objects of the (five) senses. These should always be
regarded as separate from (or [independent](errata.htm#98) of.md) the
senses. Like the charioteer setting his well-broken steeds along the
paths he pleases, the mind sets the senses (along directions it
pleases). The mind, in its turn, is employed by the knowledge sitting in
the heart. <span id="fr_453"></span>[4](#fn_453.md) The mind is the lord of
all these senses in respect of employing them in their functions and
guiding or restraining them. Similarly, the knowledge is the lord of the
mind (in employing, and guiding or restraining it). <span
id="fr_454"></span>[5](#fn_454.md) The senses, the objects of the senses,
the attributes of those objects represented by the word nature,
knowledge, mind, the vital breaths, and Jiva dwell in the bodies of all
embodied creatures. <span id="fr_455"></span>[6](#fn_455.md) The body
within which the knowledge dwells has no real existence. The body,
therefore, is not the refuge of the knowledge. Primordial Nature
(Prakriti) having the three attributes (of Goodness and Passion and
Darkness) is the refuge of the knowledge which exists only in the form
of a sound. The Soul also is not the refuge of the knowledge. It is
Desire that creates the knowledge. Desire, however, never creates the
three

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

attributes. <span id="fr_456"></span>[1](#fn_456.md) The man of wisdom,
capable of subduing his senses, beholds the seventeenth, *viz*., the
Soul, as surrounded by six and ten attributes, in his own knowledge by
the aid of the mind. The Soul cannot be beheld with the aid of the eye
or with that of all the senses. Transcending all, the Soul becomes
visible by only the light of the mind's lamp. Divested of the properties
of sound and touch and form, without taste and scent, indestructible and
without a body (either gross or subtile) and without senses, it is
nevertheless beheld within the body. Unmanifest and supreme, it dwells
in all mortal bodies. Following the lead of the preceptor and the Vedas,
he who beholds it hereafter becomes Brahma's self. They that are
possessed of wisdom look with an equal eye upon a Brahmana possessed of
knowledge and disciples, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a
Chandala. <span id="fr_457"></span>[2](#fn_457.md) Transcending all things,
the Soul dwells in all creatures mobile and immobile. Indeed, all things
are pervaded by it. <span id="fr_458"></span>[3](#fn_458.md) When a living
creature beholds his own Soul in all things, and all things in his own
Soul, he is said to attain to Brahma. One occupies that much of the
Supreme Soul as is commensurate with what is occupied in one's own soul
by Vedic sound. <span id="fr_459"></span>[4](#fn_459.md)He that can always
realise the identity of all things with his own self certainly attains
to immortality. The very gods are stupefied in the track of that
trackless man who constitutes himself the soul of all creatures, who is
engaged in the good of all beings, and who desire

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

to attain to (*Brahma* which is) the final refuge (of all things). <span
id="fr_460"></span>[1](#fn_460.md) Indeed, the track which is pursued by
men of knowledge is as visible as that of birds in the sky or of fish in
water. Time of its own power, cooks all entities within itself. No one,
however, knows That in which Time, in its turn, is itself cooked. <span
id="fr_461"></span>[2](#fn_461) That (of which I speak.md) does not occur
above, or in the middle or below, or in transverse or in any other
direction. That is to tangible entity; it is not to be found in any
place. <span id="fr_462"></span>[3](#fn_462.md) All these worlds are within
That. There is nothing in these worlds that exists out of that. Even if
one goes on ceaselessly with the celerity of a shaft impelled from the
bow-string, even if one goes on with the speed of the mind, itself, one
would not still reach the end of that which is the cause of all
this. <span id="fr_463"></span>[4](#fn_463.md) That is so gross that there
is nothing grosser. His hands and feet extend everywhere. His eyes,
head, and face are everywhere. His ears are everywhere in the universe.
He exists overwhelming all things. That is minuter than the minutest,
that is the heart of all entities. Existing, without doubt, that is
still imperceptible. Indestructible and destructible,--these are the
dual forms of existence of the (Supreme) Soul. In all mobile and
immobile entities the existence it displays is destructible; while the
existence it displays in *Chaitanya* is celestial, immortal, and
indestructible. Though the lord of a existent beings both mobile and
immobile, though inactive and divested of attributes, it enters,
nevertheless, the well-known mansion of nine doors and becomes engaged
in action. <span id="fr_464"></span>[5](#fn_464.md) Men of wisdom who are
capable of beholding the other shore say that the Unborn (or the Supreme
Soul) becomes invested with the attribute of action in consequence of
motion, pleasure and pain, variety of form, and the nine well-known
possessions. <span id="fr_465"></span>[6](#fn_465.md) That indestructible
Soul which is said to be invested with the attribute of action is
nothing else than that indestructible Soul which is said to be inactive.
A person of knowledge, by attaining to that indestructible essence,
gives up for good both life and birth.'" <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_449"></span>[178:4](m12b066.htm#fr_449.md) *Yatha* in the
first line of verse means, as the commentator explains, *yat
prakarakam*.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[179:1](m12b066.htm#fr_450.md) The commentator
points out that by these four words the four modes of life are
indicated.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[179:2](m12b066.htm#fr_451.md) The commentator
explains that this means that amongst embodied creatures they that are
ignorant take those great entities which are really non-ego for either
the ego or its Possessions.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[179:3](m12b066.htm#fr_452.md) The commentator
explains that the object of this verse is to show that the Yoga view of
the Soul being only the enjoyer but not the actor, is not correct. On
the other hand, the Sankhya view of the Soul being neither the enjoyer
nor the actor, is true. The deities, remaining in the several senses,
act and enjoy. It is through ignorance that the Soul ascribes to itself
their enjoyments and their actions.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[179:4](m12b066.htm#fr_453.md) I render *Bhutatma*
by knowledge, following the commentator who uses the words
*buddhyupadhirjivah* for explaining it.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[179:5](m12b066.htm#fr_454.md) *Niyama* and
*Visarga* are explained by the commentator as 'destruction' and
'creation.' I prefer to take them as meaning 'guiding or restraining,'
and 'employing.' Practically, the explanations are identical.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[179:6](m12b066.htm#fr_455.md) What is meant by
the objects of the senses residing within the bodies of living creatures
<span id="page_180">p. 180</span> is that (as the commentator explains)
their concepts exist in 'the cavity of the heart' (probably, mind) so
that when necessary or called for, they appear (before the mind's eye).
*Swabhava* is explained as 'attributes' like heat and cold, etc.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[180:1](m12b066.htm#fr_456.md) This is a very
difficult verse. I have rendered it, following Nilakantha's gloss. In
verse the speaker lays down what entities dwell in the body. In the rest
he expounds the nature of Sattwa which the commentator takes to mean
*buddhi* or knowledge. He begins with the statement that *Sattwasya
asrayah nasti*. This does not mean that the knowledge has no refuge, for
that would be absurd, but it means that the *asraya* of the knowledge,
*i.e.*, that in which the knowledge dwells, *viz*., the body, does not
exist, the true doctrine being that the body has no real existence but
that it exists like to its image in a dream. The body being
non-existent, what then is the real refuge of the knowledge? The speaker
answers it by saying *Gunah*, implying that primeval *Prakriti*
characterised by the three attributes is that real refuge. Then it is
said that *Chetana* (by which is implied the Soul here) is not the
refuge of the knowledge for the Soul is dissociated from everything and
incapable of transformation of any kind. The question is then mentally
started,--May not the Gunas be the qualities of the knowledge (instead
of being, as said above, its refuge)? For dispelling this doubt, it is
stated that Sattwa is the product of *Tejas* (Desire). The Gunas are
*not* the product of Tejas. Hence the Gunas, which have a different
origin cannot be the properties of *Sattwa*. The Gunas exist
independently of Desire. Thus the knowledge, which has Desire for its
originating cause, rests on the Gunas or has them for its refuge. In
this verse, therefore, the nature of the body, the knowledge, and the
Gunas, is expounded. The [grammatical](errata.htm#99.md) construction of
the first line is exceedingly terse.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[180:2](m12b066.htm#fr_457.md) Such men behold
*Brahma* in all things. *Abhijanah* is explained by the commentator as
*sishyakuladih*. This seems to be the true meaning of the word here.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[180:3](m12b066.htm#fr_458.md) In rendering this
word *tatam* (where it occurs in the *Gita*), it has been shown that to
take it as equivalent to 'spread' is incorrect. In such connections, it
is evident that it means 'pervaded!

<span id="fn_459"></span>[180:4](m12b066.htm#fr_459.md) If I have
understood the gloss aright, this is what the first line of 21 means.
*Vedatma* is explained as Vedic sound, *i.e.*, the instructions
inculcated in the Vedas. The word *atma* <span id="page_181">p.
181</span> in the second clause means simply oneself or a person or
individual. The sense then is this. The Vedas teach that all is one's
soul. The extent to which one succeeds in realising this is the measure
of one's attainment of *Brahma*. If one can realise it fully, one
attains to *Brahma* fully. If partially, one's attainment of *Brahma*
also is partial.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[181:1](m12b066.htm#fr_460.md) The track of such a
person, it is said, is as invisible as the skies. The commentator
explains that the very gods become stupefied in respect of the object
which such a man seeks, the object, of course, being *Brahma*.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[181:2](m12b066.htm#fr_461.md) That, of course, in
which Time is cooked, is *Brahma*.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[181:3](m12b066.htm#fr_462.md) By this the speaker
says that *Brahma* is not to be found in any particular spot however
holy.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[181:4](m12b066.htm#fr_463.md) Because *Brahma* is
infinite.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[181:5](m12b066.htm#fr_464.md) '*Niyatah*' is
explained by the commentator as *achanchalah*, and *vasi* as without the
fault of *upadhi*. '*Hansati*, *i.e.*, *gachechati ite*,' hence
*gatimati*.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[181:6](m12b066.htm#fr_465.md) The sense is that
the Soul residing within the body is identical with the Supreme Soul,
and men of wisdom only know it.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[181:7](m12b066.htm#fr_466.md) The construction is
*Hansoktancha yat aksharam tat* (eva) *kutastham aksharam*, meaning that
there is no difference between Jivatman and Paramatman. Both are
identical.
