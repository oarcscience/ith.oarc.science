# THE MAHABHARATA

## SANTI PARVA PART III

### SECTION CCCII

YUDHISHTHIRA SAID, 'O king thou hast duly propounded unto me, in the way
in which it should be, the path of Yoga which is approved by the wise,
after the manner of a loving preceptor unto his pupil. I ask now about
the principles of the Sankhya philosophy. Do thou discourse to me on
those principles in their entirety. Whatever knowledge exists in the
three worlds is known to thee!'

"Bhishma said, 'Listen now to what the subtile principles are of the
followers of the Sankhya doctrine have been established by all the great
and puissant Yatis having Kapila their first. In that doctrine O chief
of men, no errors are discoverable. Many, indeed, are its merits. In
fact, there is no fault in it. Comprehending with the aid of knowledge
that all objects exist with faults, indeed, understanding that the
objects--so difficult to cast off--with which human beings and Pisachas
and Rakshasas and Yakshas and snakes and Gandharvas and pitris and those
that are wandering in the intermediate orders of beings (such as birds
and animals) and great birds (such as Garuda and others) and the Maruts
and royal sages and regenerate sages and Asuras and Viswedevas and the
celestial Rishis and Yogins invested with supreme puissance and the
Prajapatis and Brahman himself are engaged, and understanding truly what
the highest limit is of one's period of existence in this world, and
apprehending also the great truth. O foremost of eloquent men, about
what is called felicity here, having a clear knowledge of what the
sorrows are that overtake when the hour comes all those that are
concerned with (transitory) objects and knowing full well the sorrows of
those that have fallen into the intermediate orders of being and of
those that have sunk into hell, perceiving all the merits and all the
faults of heaven, O Bharta, and all the demerits that attach to the
declarations of the Vedas and all the excellencies that are connected
with them recognising the faults and merits of the Yoga and the Sankhya
systems of philosophy, realizing also that the quality of Sattwa has ten
properties, that of Rajas has nine, and that of Tamas has eight, that
the Understanding has seven properties, the Mind has six, and Space has
five, and once more conceiving that the Understanding has four
properties and Tamas has three, and the Rajas has two and Sattwa has,
one, and truly apprehending the path that is followed by all objects
when destruction overtakes

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

them and what the course is of self knowledge, the Sankhyas, possessed
of knowledge and experience and exalted by their perceptions of causes,
and acquiring thorough auspiciousness, attain to the felicity of
Emancipation like the rays of the Sun, or the Wind taking refuge in
Space. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) Vision is attached to form; the
sense of scent to smell, the ear to sound, the tongue to juices, and the
skin (or body) to touch. The wind has for its refuge Space. Stupefaction
has Tamas (Darkness) for its refuge. Cupidity has the objects of the
senses for its refuge. Vishnu is attached to (the organs of) motion.
Sakra is attached to (the organs of) strength. The deity of fire is
attached to the stomach, Earth is attached to the Waters. The Waters
have Heat (or fire) for their refuge. Heat attaches itself to the Wind;
and the wind has Space for its refuge; and Space has Mahat for its
refuge, and Mahat has the Understanding for its foundation. The
Understanding has its refuge in Tamas; Tamas has Rajas for its refuge;
Rajas is founded upon Sattwa; and Sattwa is attached to the Soul. The
soul has the glorious and puissant Narayana for its refuge. That
glorious deity has Emancipation for his refuge. Emancipation is
independent of all refuge. Knowing that this body, that is endued with
six and ten possessions, is the result of the quality of Sattwa,
understanding fully the nature of the physical organism and the
character of the Chetana that dwells within it, recognising the one
existent Being that live in the body *viz*., the Soul, which stands
aloof from every concern of the body and in which no sin can attach,
realising the nature of that second object, *viz*.; the acts of persons
attached to the objects of the senses, understanding also the character
of the senses and the sensual objects which have their refuge in the
Soul, appreciating the difficulty of Emancipation and the scriptures
that bear upon it knowing fully the nature of the vital breaths called
Prana, Apana, Samana, Vyana, and Udana, as also the two other breaths,
*viz*., the one going downward and the other moving upward indeed,
knowing those seven breaths ordained to accomplish seven different
functions, ascertaining the nature of the

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Prajapatis and the Rishis and the high paths,
many in number, of virtue or righteousness, and the seven Rishis and the
innumerable royal Rishis, O scorcher of foes, and the great celestial
Rishis and the other regenerate Rishis endued with the effulgence of the
Sun, beholding all these falling away from their puissance in course of
many long ages, O monarch, hearing of the destruction of even of all the
mighty beings in the universe, understanding also the inauspicious end
that is attained, O king, by creatures of sinful acts, and the miseries
endured by those that fall into the river Vaitarani in the realms of
Yama, and the inauspicious wanderings of creatures through diverse
wombs, and the character of their residence in the unholy uterus in the
midst of blood and water and phlegm and urine and faeces, all of foul
smell, and then in bodies that result from the union of blood and the
vital seed, of marrow and sinews, abounding with hundreds of nerves and
arteries and forming an impure mansion of nine doors, comprehending also
what is for his own good what those divers combinations are which are
productive of good beholding the abominable conduct of creatures whose
natures are characterised by Darkness or Passion or Goodness, O chief of
Bharata's race--conduct that is reprehended, in view of its incapacity
to acquire Emancipation, by the followers of the Sankhya doctrine who
are fully conversant with the Soul, beholding the swallowing up of the
Moon and the Sun by Rahu, the falling of stars from their fixed
positions and the diversions of constellations from their orbits,
knowing the sad separation of all united objects and the diabolical
behaviour of creatures in devouring one another, seeing the absence of
all intelligence in the infancy of human beings and the deterioration
and destruction of the body, marking the little attachment creatures
have to the quality of Sattwa in consequence of their being overwhelmed
by wrath and stupefaction, beholding also only one among thousands of
human beings resolved to struggle after the acquisition of Emancipation,
understanding the difficulty of attaining to Emancipation according to
what is stated in the scriptures, seeing the marked solicitude that
creatures manifest for all unattained objects and their comparative
indifference to all objects that have been attained marking the
wickedness that results from all objects of the senses O king and the
repulsive bodies, O son of Kunti, of persons reft of life, and the
residence, always fraught with grief, of human beings, O Bharata, in
houses (in the midst of spouses and children), knowing the end of those
terrible and fallen men who become guilty of slaying Brahmanas, and of
those wicked Brahmanas that are addicted to the drinking of
[alcoholic](errata.htm#134.md) stimulants, and the equally sad end of those
that become criminally attached to the spouses of their preceptors, and
of those men, O Yudhishthira, that do not properly reverence their
mothers, as also of those that have no reverence and worship to offer to
the deities, understanding also, with the help of that knowledge (which
their philosophy imparts), the end that of all perpetrators of wicked
acts, and the diverse ends that overtake those who have taken birth
among the intermediate orders, ascertaining the diverse declarations of
the Vedas, the

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

courses of seasons, the fading of years, of months, of fortnights, and
of days, beholding directly the waxing and the waning of the Moon,
seeing the rising and the ebbing of the seas, and the diminution of
wealth and its increase once more, and the separation of united objects,
the lapse of Yugas, the destruction of mountains, the drying up of
rivers, the deterioration of (the purity of) the several orders and the
end also of that deterioration occurring repeatedly, beholding the
birth, decrepitude, death, and sorrows of creatures, knowing truly the
faults attaching to the body and the sorrows to which human beings are
subject, and the vicissitudes to which the bodies of creatures are
subject, and understanding all the faults that attach to their own
souls, and also all the inauspicious faults that attach to their own
bodies (the followers of the Sankhya philosophy succeed in attaining to
Emancipation).

"Yudhishthira said, 'O thou of immeasurable energy, what are those
faults that thou seest attaching to one's body? It behoveth thee to
ex-pound this doubt to me fully and truly'?

"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O slayer of foes! The Sankhyas or followers of
Kapila, who are conversant with all paths and endued with wisdom, say
that there are five faults, O puissant one, in the human body. They are
Desire and Wrath and Fear and Sleep and Breath. These faults are seen in
the bodies of all embodied creatures. Those that are endued with wisdom
cut the root of wrath with the aid of Forgiveness. Desire is cut off by
casting off all purposes. By cultivation of the quality of Goodness
(Sattwa) sleep is conquered, and Fear is conquered by cultivating
Heedfulness. Breath is conquered by abstemiousness of diet O king. Truly
understanding gunas by the aid of hundreds of *gunas*, hundreds of
faults, and diverse causes by hundreds of causes, ascertaining that the
world is like the froth of water, enveloped by hundreds of illusions
flowing from Vishnu, like a painted edifice, and as unsubstantial as a
reed, beholding it to be (as terrible as) a dark pit, or as unreal as
bubbles of water, for the years that compose its age are as shortlived
(compared to the duration of eternity) as bubbles, seeing it exposed to
immediate destruction, bereft of happiness, having certain ruin for its
end and from which it can never escape, sunk in Rajas and Tamas, and
utterly helpless like an elephant sunk in mire,--noting all this--the
Sankhyas, O king, endued with great wisdom, casting off all affections
arising from one's relation towards one's children, by the aid, O king,
of that extensive and all-embracing knowledge which their system
advocates and cutting off quickly, with the weapon of knowledge and the
bludgeon of penances, O Bharata, all inauspicious scents born of Rajas
and all scents of a like nature arising from Tamas and all auspicious
scents arising from Sattwa and all pleasures of the touch (and of the
other senses) born of the same three qualities and inhering to the body,
indeed, O Bharata, aided by the Yoga of knowledge, these Yatis crowned
with success,--cross the Ocean of life. That Ocean, so terrible has
sorrow for its waters. Anxiety and grief constitute its deep lakes.
Disease and death are its gigantic alligators.

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The great fears that strike the heart at every
step are its huge snakes. The deeds inspired by Tamas are its tortoises.
Those inspired by Rajas are its fishes. Wisdom constitutes the raft for
crossing it. The affections entertained for objects of the senses are
its mire. Decrepitude constitutes its region of grief and trouble. <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) Knowledge, O chastiser of foes, is its
island. Acts constitute its great depth. Truth is its shores. Pious
observances constitute the verdant weeds floating on its bosom. <span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md) Envy constitutes its rapid and mighty
current. The diverse sentiments of the heart constitute its mines. The
diverse kinds of gratification are its valuable gems. Grief and fever
are its winds. Misery and thirst are its mighty eddies. Painful and
fatal diseases are its huge elephants. The assemblage of bones are its
flights of steps, and phlegm is its froth. Gifts are its pearl-banks.
The lakes of blood are its corals. Loud laughter constitutes its roars.
Diverse sciences are its impassability. Tears are its brine.
Renunciation of company constitutes the high refuge (of those that seek
to cross it). Children and spouses are its unnumbered leeches. Friends
and kinsmen are the cities and towns on its shores. Abstention from
injury, and Truth, are its boundary line. Death is its storm-wave. The
knowledge of Vedanta is its island (capable of affording refuge to those
that are tossed upon its waters). Acts of compassion towards all
creatures constitute its life-buoys, <span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md)
and Emancipation is the priceless commodity offered to those voyaging on
its waters in search of merchandise. Like its substantive prototype with
its equine head disgorging flames of fire, this ocean too has its fiery
terrors. Having transcended the liability, that is so difficult to
transcend, of dwelling within the gross body, the Sankhyas enter into
pure space. <span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#fn_4.md) Surya then bears, with his
rays, those righteous men that are practicers of the Sankhya doctrines.
Like the fibres of the lotus-stalk conveying water to the flower into
which they all converge. Surya, drinking all things from the universe,
conveys them unto those good and wise men. <span
id="fr_5"></span>[5](#fn_5.md) There attachments

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

all destroyed, possessed of energy, endued with wealth of penances, and
crowned with success, these Yatis, O Bharata, are born by that wind
which is subtile, cooling, fragrant, and delicious to the touch, O
Bharata! In fact, that wind which is the best of the seven winds, and
which blows in regions of great felicity, conveys them, O son of Kunti,
to that which is the highest end in space. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) Then space into which they are carried, O
monarch, conveys them to the highest end of Rajas. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md) Rajas then bear them to the highest end of
Sattwa. Sattwa then bears them, O thou of pure soul, to the Supreme and
puissant Narayana. The puissant and pure-souled Narayana at last,
through himself, bears them to the Supreme Soul. Having reached the
Supreme Soul, those stainless persons who have (by that time) become the
body of (what is called). That attain to immortality, and they have
never afterwards to return from that position. O King! That is the
highest end, O son of Pritha, which is attained by those high-souled men
who have transcended the influence of all pairs of opposites.'"

Yudhishthira said, 'O [sinless](errata.htm#135.md) one, have those persons
of firm vows after they have attained to that excellent position which
is fraught with puissance and felicity, any recollection of their lives
including birth and death? It behoveth thee to tell me properly what the
truth is in respect, O thou of Kuru's race. I do not think it proper to
question any one else than thee! Observing the scriptures bearing upon
Emancipation, I find this great fault in the subject (for certain
scriptures on the topic declare that [consciousness](errata.htm#136.md)
disappears in the emancipate state, while other scriptures declare the
very reverse of this). If, having attained to this high state, the Yatis
continue to live in consciousness, it would seem. O king, that the
religion of Pravritti is superior. If, again, consciousness disappears
from the emancipate state and one who has become emancipate only
resembles a person sunk in dreamless slumber, then nothing can be more
improper than to say that there is really no consciousness in
Emancipation (for of all that happens in dreamless slumber is that one's
consciousness is temporarily overshadowed and suspended, but never lost,
for it returns when one awakes from that slumber).' <span
id="fr_8"></span>[3](#fn_8.md)

"Bhishma said, 'However difficult it may be to answer it, the question
which thou hast asked, O son, is proper. Verily, the question is of such
a kind that even they that are possessed of great learning become
stupefied in answering it, O chief of Bharata's race. For all that, hear
what the truth is as expounded by me. The high-souled followers of
Kapila have set their high understandings on this point. The senses of
knowledge, O King, planted in the bodies of embodied creatures, are
employed in their

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

respective functions of perception. They are the instruments of the
Soul, for it is through them that subtile Being perceives. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) Disunited with the Soul, the senses are like
lumps of wood, and are without doubt, destroyed (in respect of the
functions they serve) like the froth that is seen on the bosom of the
ocean. <span id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10.md) When the embodied
[creature](errata.htm#137.md), O scorcher of foes, sinks into sleep along
with his senses, the subtile Soul then roves among all subjects like the
wind through space. <span id="fr_11"></span>[3](#fn_11.md) The subtile
Soul, during slumber, continues to see (all forms) and touch all objects
of touch, O king, and taken in other perceptions, as well as when it is
awake. In consequence of their inability to act without their director,
the senses, during sleep, all become extinguished in their respective
places (and lose their powers) like snakes deprived of poison. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[4](#fn_12.md) At such times, the subtile Soul, repairing
into the respective place of all the senses, without doubt, discharges
all their functions. <span id="fr_13"></span>[5](#fn_13.md) All the
qualities of Sattwa, all the attributes of the Under-standing, O
Bharata, as also those of Mind, and space, and Wind, O thou of righteous
soul, and all the attributes of liquid substances, of Water, O Partha,
and Of Earth,--these senses with these qualities,--O Yudhishthira, which
inhere to Jiva-souls, are along with the Jiva-soul itself, overwhelmed
by the Supreme Soul or Brahma. Acts also, good and bad, overwhelm that
Jiva-soul. Like disciples waiting upon their preceptor with reverence,
the senses too wait upon the Jiva-soul transcends Prakriti, it attains
to Brahma that is without change, that is highest, that is Narayana,
that is beyond all pairs of opposites, and that transcends Prakriti.
Freed from both merit and demerit, the Jiva-soul entering the Supreme
Soul which is divested of all attributes, and which is the home of all
auspiciousness, does not return thence, O Bharata. What remains, O son,
is the mind with the senses, O Bharata. These have to come back once
more at the appointed season for doing the bidding

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

of their great master. <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) Soon after, O
son of Kunti, (when this body is cast off) the Yati striving after
Emancipation, endued as he is with knowledge and desirous as he is of
Guna, succeeds in attaining to that Peace of Emancipation which is his
who becomes bodiless. <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md)  <span
id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16.md) The Sankhyas, O king, are endued with
great wisdom. They succeed in attaining to the highest end by means of
this kind of knowledge. There is no knowledge that is equal to this. Do
not yield to any kind of doubt. The knowledge which is described in the
system of the Sankhyas is regarded as the highest. That knowledge is
immutable and is eternally fixed. It is eternal Brahma in fulness. It
has no beginning, middle and end. It transcends all pairs of opposites.
It is the cause of the creation of the universe. It stands in fulness.
It is without deterioration of any kind. It is uniform, and everlasting.
Thus are its praises sung by the wise. From it flow creation and
destruction and all modifications. The great Rishis speak of it and
applaud it in the scriptures. All learned Brahmanas and all righteous
men regard it as flowing from Brahma, Supreme, Divine, Infinite,
Immutable, and Undeteriorating. All Brahmanas again that are attached to
objects of the senses adore and applaud it by ascribing to it attributes
that belong to illusion. <span id="fr_17"></span>[4](#fn_17.md) The same is
the view of Yogins well observant of penances and meditation and of
Sankhyas of immeasureable insight. The Srutis declare, O son of Kunti,
that the Sankhya form of philosophy is the form of that Formless one.
The cognitions (according to that philosophy) have, O chief of Bharata's
race, been said to be the knowledge of Brahma. <span
id="fr_18"></span>[5](#fn_18.md)

"There are two kinds of creatures on Earth, O lord of Earth, *viz*.,
mobile and immobile. Of these that are mobile are superior, That high
knowledge, O king, which exists in persons conversant with Brahma, and
that which occurs in the Vedas, and that which is found in other
scriptures, and that in Yoga, and that which may be seen in the diverse

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Puranas, are all, O monarch, to be found in
Sankhya philosophy. <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) Whatever
knowledge is seen to exist in high histories whatever knowledge occurs,
O king, in the sciences appertaining to the acquisition of wealth as
approved by the wise, whatever other knowledge exists in this
world,--all these,--flow, O high-souled monarch, from the high knowledge
that occurs among the Sankhyas. Tranquillity of soul, high puissance,
all subtile knowledge of which the scriptures speak, penances of subtile
force, and all kinds of felicity, O king, have all been duly ordained in
the Sankhya system. Failing to acquire, O son of Pritha, that
[complete](errata.htm#139.md) knowledge which is recommended by their
system, the Sankhyas attain to the status of deities and pass many years
in felicity. Lording it over the celestials as they will, they fall,
upon the expiration of the allotted period, among learned Brahmanas and
Yatis. <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md) Casting off this body, those
regenerate ones that follow the Sankhya system enter into the superior
state of Brahma like the celestials entering into the firmament by
devoting themselves wholly to that adorable system which is theirs and
which is worshipped by all wise men. Those regenerate persons that are
devoted to the acquisition of that knowledge which is recommended in the
Sankhya system, even if they fail to attain to eminence, are never seen
to fall among intermediate creatures, or to sink into the status of
sinful men. That high-souled person who is fully conversant with the
vast, high, ancient, ocean-like, and immeasurable Sankhya system that is
pure and liberal and agreeable, becomes, O king, equal to Narayana. I
have now told thee, O god among men, the truth about the Sankhya system.
It is the embodiment of Narayana, of the universe as it exists from the
remotest time. <span id="fr_21"></span>[3](#fn_21.md) When the time of
Creation comes, He causes the Creation to start into life, and when the
time comes for destruction, He swallows up everything. Having withdrawn
everything into his own body he goes to sleep,--that inner Soul of the
universe.'" <span id="fr_22"></span>[4](#fn_22.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[2:1](m12c001.htm#fr_0.md) The ten properties
included in Sattwa or Goodness are gladness, cheerfulness, enthusiasm,
fame, righteousness, contentment, faith, sincerity, liberality, and
lordship. The nine properties included in Rajas or Passion are belief in
the deities, (ostentatious) charity, enjoyment and endurance of
happiness and sorrow, disunion, exhibition of manliness, lust and wrath,
intoxication, pride, malice, and disposition to revile. The eight
qualities included in Tamas or Darkness are unconsciousness,
stupefaction, excess of stupefaction, muddiness of the understanding;
blindness (of results), sleep, heedlessness, and procrastination. The
seven incidents of Buddhi or the Understanding are Mahat, consciousness,
and the five subtile essences. The six incidents of Mind are Mind and
the five senses. The five incidents appertaining to Space are space,
water, wind, light, and earth. According to a different school of
philosophy, Buddhi, or the Under-standing is said to have four incidents
appertaining to it, *viz*., doubt, ascertainment, pride, and memory.
Tames (darkness) also is otherwise regarded to have only three
incidents, *viz*., inability of comprehension, partial comprehension,
and totally erroneous comprehension. Rajas (Passion) is (according to
this school) regarding as having only the two incidents of inclination
(to act) and sorrow. Sattwa has but one incident *viz*., Enlightenment.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[5:1](m12c001.htm#fr_1.md) 'Durga' is an
inaccessible region such as a forest or wilderness which cannot be
passed through except with great pain and danger.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[5:2](m12c001.htm#fr_2.md) The correct reading seems
to be *sthira-vratati-samkulam*.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[5:3](m12c001.htm#fr_3.md) *Udadhi* is, literally, a
water-jar. In this country most people, while swimming, use water jars
as buoys. The mouth of jar being dipped into the water the air confined
within it serve to support heavy weights. I have heard that the most
rapid currents are crossed by milkmaids in this way, all the while
bearing milk pails on their heads.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[5:4](m12c001.htm#fr_4.md) In the second line of 72,
*dustaram janma* means *janma-yuktam dustaram*.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[5:5](m12c001.htm#fr_5.md) The sense seems to be
that by practising the Sankhya doctrine men cease to have any regard for
even their gross bodies. They succeed in realising their existence as
independent of all earthly or heavenly objects. What is meant by the Sun
bearing them in his rays and conveying to them all things from every
part of the universe is that these men acquire great puissance. This is
not the puissance of Yoga but of knowledge. Everything being regarded as
unsubstantial and transitory, the position of Indra himself, or of
Brahman, is looked upon as desirable and unworthy of acquisition.
Sincere conviction of this kind and the course of conduct that is
confirmable to it is literally puissance of the highest kind, for all
the purposes of puissance are capable of being served by it.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[6:1](m12c001.htm#fr_6.md) This is taken as meaning
that the Sankhyas are conveyed to the firmament of the heart. Perhaps,
what is intended by it is that they become withdrawn from external
objects and even the impressions of all external things.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[6:2](m12c001.htm#fr_7.md) Perhaps, this means the
pleasures of heaven.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[6:3](m12c001.htm#fr_8.md) *i.e.*, they who have
identified themselves with Brahma.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[7:1](m12c001.htm#fr_9.md) Yudhisthira's question
seems to be this. Is there or is there not consciousness in the
emancipate state? Different scriptures answer this question differently.
If it be said that there is consciousness in that state, then why
discard heaven and its pleasures, or the religion of Pravritti or acts
which lead to those pleasures? Where is the necessity then of Sannyasa
or the religion of Nivritti or abstention from all acts? On the
supposition of there being consciousness in the emancipate state, the
Religion of Pravritti should be taken as superior. If, on the other
hand, the existence of consciousness be denied, that would be an error.
*Dnkshataram* is *ayuktaram*.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[7:2](m12c001.htm#fr_10.md) Although I make use of
the word 'perceive' yet remembering that the mind is included among the
senses and regarded as the sixth sense, the functions of recollection,
representation, etc., are also implied by the word *pasyati*. The
Burdwan translator gives a ridiculously erroneous version of this verse.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[7:3](m12c001.htm#fr_11.md) The commentator
explains that the simile of the froth is introduced in consequence of
its disappearance with the disappearance of water. K. P. Singha is
incorrect in taking the instance of froth as illustrative of the
quickness of the destruction.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[7:4](m12c001.htm#fr_12.md) *Sarvatra* does not
mean 'through every part of the sleeper's body' as. K. P. Singha takes
it, but *sarvavishaye* as the commentator correctly explains it.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[7:5](m12c001.htm#fr_13.md) *Iha* is *sapne Anisah*
is *nasti isah* or *pravartaah yasya*.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[8:1](m12c001.htm#fr_14.md) For the Soul, in
dreams, sees and hears and touches and smells etc., precisely as it does
while awake.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[8:2](m12c001.htm#fr_15.md) The sense seems to be
that a person who becomes emancipate in this life becomes so in
*Samadhi*. When the state of *Samadhi* is over, his mind and senses
return; and returning they do the bidding of the Supreme, *i.e.*, bring
about both happiness and misery, which, of course, are the consequences
of the acts of past lives though that happiness and misery are not felt.
In the next verse is said that these men very soon leave their bodies
and become freed from rebirth.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[8:3](m12c001.htm#fr_16.md) There are two kinds of
Emancipation: one is attainable here, in this body, it is *Jivan-mukti*;
the other is *Videha-kaivalya* or that which becomes one's when one is
bodiless. In 98, *Jivan-mukti* has been spoken of. In this verse, the
observations apply to *Videha-kaivalya*.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[8:4](m12c001.htm#fr_17.md) *Vadanti* is
*stuvanti*. Such men hymn its praises by regarding it as Supreme Deity
possessed of attributes. Those attributes, of course, are the result of
illusion, for in its real nature there can be no attributes in Brahma.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[8:5](m12c001.htm#fr_18.md) Brahma is knowledge
without duality *i.e.*, knowledge without the consciousness of knower
and known. The [knowledge](errata.htm#138.md) or cognition of an object,
when object is annihilated, assumes the form of that knowledge which is
called Brahma.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[9:1](m12c001.htm#fr_19.md) The commentator
explains that the object of this verse is to show that among mobile
creatures those endued with knowledge are superior, and among all kinds
of knowledge, the knowledge [occurring](errata.htm#140.md) in the Sankhya
system is the highest.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[9:2](m12c001.htm#fr_20.md) *i.e.*, if in
consequence of any defect of practice or *Sadhana*, the Sankhyas fail to
attain to Emancipation, they at least become translated into gods.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[9:3](m12c001.htm#fr_21.md) *i.e.*, it is
everything.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[9:4](m12c001.htm#fr_22.md) That Narayana who does
all this is the embodiment of the Sankhya system.
