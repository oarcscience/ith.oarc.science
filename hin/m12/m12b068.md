### SECTION CCXLI

"Suka said, 'The declarations of the Vedas are twofold. They once Jay
down the command, 'Do all acts.' They also indicate (the reverse,
saying), 'Give up acts.' I ask, 'Whither do persons go by the aid of
Knowledge and whither by the aid of acts?' <span
id="fr_479"></span>[2](#fn_479.md) I desire to hear this. Do tell me this.
Indeed, these declarations about knowledge and acts are dissimilar and
even contradictory.'

"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed, the son of Parasara said these
words unto his son, 'I shall expound to thee the two paths, *viz*., the
destructible and the indestructible, depending respectively upon acts
and knowledge. Listen with concentrated attention, O child, to me, as I
tell thee the place that is reached by one with the aid of knowledge,
and that other place which is reached with the aid of acts. The
difference between these two places is as great as the limitless sky.
The question that thou hast asked me has given me such pain as an
atheistic discourse gives to a man of faith. These are the two paths
upon which the Vedas are established; the duties (acts) indicated by
*Pravritti*, and those based on *Nivritti* that have been treated of so
excellently. <span id="fr_480"></span>[3](#fn_480.md) By acts, a living
creature is destroyed. By knowledge, however, he becomes emancipated.
For this reason, Yogins who behold the other side of the ocean of life
never betake themselves to acts. Through acts one is forced to take
rebirth, after death, with a body composed of the six and ten
ingredients. Through knowledge, however, one becomes transformed into
that which is Eternal, Unmanifest, and Immutable. One class of persons
that are however of little intelligence, applaud acts. In consequence of
this they have to assume bodies (one after another) ceaselessly. Those
men whose perceptions are keen in respect of duties and who have
attained to that high understanding (which leads to knowledge), never
applaud acts even as persons that depend for their drinking water upon
the supply of streams never applaud wells and tanks. The fruit that one
obtains of acts consists of pleasure and pain, of existence and
non-existence. By knowledge, one attains to that

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

whither there is no occasion for grief; whither one becomes freed from
both birth and death; whither one is not subject to decrepitude; whither
one transcends the state of conscious existence. <span
id="fr_481"></span>[1](#fn_481.md) whither is *Brahma* which is Supreme,
Unmanifest, immutable, ever-existent, imperceptible, above the reach of
pain, immortal, and transcending destruction; whither all become freed
from the influence of all pairs of opposites (Like pleasure and pain,
etc.), as also of wish or purpose. <span id="fr_482"></span>[2](#fn_482.md)
Reaching that stage, they cast equal eyes on everything, become
universal friends and devoted to the good of all creatures. There is a
wide gulf, O son, between one devoted to knowledge and one devoted to
acts. Know that the man of knowledge, without undergoing destruction,
remains existent for ever like the moon on the last day of the dark
fortnight existing in a subtle (but undestroyed) form. The great *Rishi*
(Yajnavalkya in Vrihadaranayaka) has said this more elaborately. As
regards the man devoted to acts, his nature may be inferred from
beholding the new-born moon which appears like a bent thread in the
firmament. <span id="fr_483"></span>[3](#fn_483.md) Know, O son, that the
person of acts takes rebirth with a body with eleven entities, for its
ingredients, that are the results of modification, and with a subtile
form that represents a total of six and ten. <span
id="fr_484"></span>[4](#fn_484.md) The deity who takes refuge in that
(material) form, like a drop of water on a lotus leaf, should be known
as *Kshetrajna* (Soul), which is Eternal, and which succeeds by Yoga in
transcending both the mind and the knowledge. <span
id="fr_485"></span>[5](#fn_485.md) Tamas, Rajas, and Sattwa are the
attributes of the knowledge. The knowledge is the attribute of the
individual soul residing within the body. The individual soul, in its
turn, comes from the Supreme Soul. <span id="fr_486"></span>[6](#fn_486.md)
The body with the soul is said to be the attribute of *jiva*. It is
*jiva* that acts and cause all bodies to live. He who has created the
seven worlds is said by those that are acquainted with what is *Kshetra*
(and what is Kshetrajna) to be above *jiva*.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_479"></span>[185:2](m12b068.htm#fr_479.md) The Vedas proclaim
the efficacy of both acts and knowledge. Acts are not laid down for
those that have knowledge.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[185:3](m12b068.htm#fr_480.md) *Subhashita* is
explained by the commentator as *ayam tu paramo dharma yat yogena
atmadarsanam*.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[186:1](m12b068.htm#fr_481.md) *Na vartate* does
not mean annihilated but, as the commentator explains, *aham asmi iti na
jana atmanam*.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[186:2](m12b068.htm#fr_482.md) *Manasena karmana*
is explained by the commentator as *sankalpena*.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[186:3](m12b068.htm#fr_483.md) The meaning is
this: the man of acts is like the new-born moon, *i.e.*, subject to
growth and decay.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[186:4](m12b068.htm#fr_484.md) This has been
explained in a previous section.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[186:5](m12b068.htm#fr_485.md) The soul resides in
the body without partaking of any of the attributes of the body. It is,
therefore, likened to a drop of water on a lotus leaf, which, though on
the leaf, is not yet attached to it, in so much that it may go off
without at all soaking or drenching any part of the leaf.
*Yogajitatmakam* is *yogena jito niruddha atma chittam yena tam*, as
explained by the commentator.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[186:6](m12b068.htm#fr_486.md) Literally, '*Tamas*
and *Rajas* and *Sattwa* have the attribute of Jiva for their essence.'
The particular attribute of Jiva here referred to is the *Jnanamaya
kosha*. *Jiva*, again, is all <span id="page_187">p. 187</span> accident
of the Soul. The Soul comes from the Supreme Soul. Thus the chain of
existence is traced to the Supreme Soul. In verse 20 again it is said
that the body, which by itself is inanimate, when it exists with the
Soul, is an accident of Jiva as uninvested with attributes.
