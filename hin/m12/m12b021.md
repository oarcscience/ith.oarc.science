### SECTION CXCIV

"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, what and of what nature is
that which is called by the name of *Adhyatma* and which is laid down
for every person. <span id="fr_100"></span>[4](#fn_100.md) O thou that art
acquainted with Brahma, whence has this universe consisting of mobile
and immobile things, been created? When universal destruction sets in,
to whom does it go? It behoveth thee to discourse to me upon this
topic.' <span id="fr_101"></span>[5](#fn_101.md)

"Bhishma [said](errata.htm#65.md) 'This, *Adhyatma*, O son of Pritha, that
thou askest me about, I will presently discourse upon. It is highly
agreeable and productive of great felicity. Great teachers have (before
this) show the truths about Creation and the Destruction (of the
universe). Knowing those truths, a person may

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

obtain, even in this world, great satisfaction and felicity. Such
knowledge may lead also to the acquisition of great fruits, and it is
highly beneficial to all creatures. Earth, air, space, water, and light
numbered as the fifth, are regarded as Great Creatures. These constitute
both the origin and the destruction of all created objects. Unto him
from whom these great primal elements take their origin, they return
repeatedly, severing themselves from all creatures (into whose
compositions they enter), even like the waves of the ocean (subsiding
into that from which they seem to take their rise). As the tortoise
stretches its limbs and withdraws them again, even so the Supreme Soul
creates all objects and again withdraws into Himself. The Creator places
the five primal elements in all created objects in different
proportions. The living creature, however, does not see it (through
ignorance). Sound, the organs of hearing, and all holes,--these
three,--spring from Space as their progenitor. Touch, action, and skin
are the triple attributes of the Wind. Form, eye, and digestion are the
triple attributes of Fire or Energy. Taste, all liquid secretions, and
the tongue represent the three attributes of Water. Scents, the nose,
and the body are the triple properties of Earth. The great (primal)
elements are five. The mind is the sixth. The senses and the mind, O
Bharata, are (the sources of all) the perceptions of a living
creature. <span id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_102.md) The seventh is called
the understanding; and the eighth is the soul. <span
id="fr_103"></span>[2](#fn_103.md) The senses are for perceiving; the mind
(unable to deal with those perceptions) produces uncertainty. The
understanding reduces all perceptions to certainty. The Soul exists as a
witness (without acting). All that is above the two feet, all that is
behind, and all that is above, are seen by the Soul. Know that the Soul
pervades the entire being without any space being left unoccupied. All
men should know the senses, the mind, and the understanding fully. The
three states or qualities called Darkness, Passion, and Goodness, exist,
dependent on the senses, the mind, and the understanding. <span
id="fr_104"></span>[3](#fn_104.md) Man, by apprehending with the aid of his
intelligence, the manner in which creatures come and leave the world, is
sure to gradually attain to steadfast tranquillity. The three qualities
(already mentioned, *viz*., Darkness, Passion, and Goodness), lead the
understanding (to worldly attachments). In this respect, the
Understanding (or Intelligence) is identical with the Senses and the
Mind. The Understanding, therefore, is identical with the six (the five
senses and the mind), and also with the objects comprehended by it.
When, however, the Understanding is destroyed, the three

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

qualities (of Darkness, Passion, and Goodness) are incapable of leading
to action. <span id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105.md) This universe of
immobile and mobile things consists of that intelligence. It is from
that Intelligence that everything arises and it is into it that
everything subsides. For this reason, the scriptures indicate that
everything is a manifestation of Intelligence. That by which one hears
is the ear. That by which one smells is called the organ of smell, and
that by which one distinguishes the tastes is called the tongue. By the
coat that covers the body one acquires perception of touch. That which
is called the Intelligence undergoes modifications. <span
id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_106.md) When the Intelligence desires anything
it comes to be called Mind. The foundations upon which the Intelligence
rests are five in number, each serving a different purpose. They are
called the senses. The invisible principle, *viz*., Intelligence rests
on them. The Intelligence that exists in a living creature concerns
itself with the three states (called Passion, Darkness, and Goodness).
Sometimes it obtains joy and sometimes misery. Sometimes it becomes
divested of both joy and misery. Even thus the Intelligence exists in
the minds of all men. Sometimes the Intelligence which is made up of the
triple states (already mentioned), transcends those three states (by
*yoga*), like the lord of rivers, *viz*., the Ocean, with his surges,
transgressing his high continents. <span id="fr_107"></span>[3](#fn_107.md)
That Intelligence which transcends the three qualities exist in the mind
in a pure state of (unmodified) existence: alone. The quality of
Darkness, however, that impels to action, soon pursues it. At that time,
the Intelligence sets all the senses to action. The properties of the
three are even thus: joy dwells in Goodness; sorrow in Passion; delusion
in Darkness. All the states that exist (of the mind) are included in the
three (that have been named). I have now, O Bharata, told thee about the
course of the Understanding. An intelligent man should subdue all his
senses.. The three qualities of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness, are
always attached to living creatures. Three kinds of intelligence also
are noticeable in every creature, *viz*., that which depends upon
Goodness, that upon Passion, and that upon Darkness, O Bharata. The
quality of Goodness brings happiness; the quality of Passion produces
sorrow; and if these two combine with the quality of

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Darkness, then neither happiness nor sorrow is
produced (but, instead, only delusion or error). Every state of
happiness that appears in the body or the mind is said to be due to the
quality of Goodness. A state of sorrow, disagreeable to oneself', that
comes, is due to nothing but the quality of Passion. One should never
think of it with fear. <span id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_108.md) That state,
again, which is allied with delusion and error, and in consequence of
which one knows not what to do, which is unascertainable and unknown,
should be regarded as belonging to the quality of Darkness. <span
id="fr_109"></span>[2](#fn_109.md) Gladness, satisfaction, delight,
happiness, tranquillity of heart, these are the properties of the state
of Goodness. Man sometimes obtains a measure of them. Discontent,
heart-burning, grief, cupidity, vindictiveness are all indications of
the state of Passion. They are seen with or without adequate causes for
producing them. Disgrace, [delusion](errata.htm#66.md), error, sleep and
stupefaction, that overtake one through excess of ill-luck, are the
various properties of the state of Darkness. <span
id="fr_110"></span>[3](#fn_110.md) That person whose mind is far-reaching,
capable of extending in all directions, mistrustful in respect of
winning the objects it desires, and well-restrained, is happy both here
and hereafter. <span id="fr_111"></span>[4](#fn_111.md) Mark the
distinction between these two subtile things, *viz*., Intelligence and
Soul. One of these (*viz*., intelligence), puts forth the qualities. The
other (*viz*., the Soul), does nothing of the kind. A gnat and a fig may
be seen to be united with each other. Though united, each however is
distinct from the other. Similarly, Intelligence and Soul, though
distinguished from each other, by their respective natures, yet they may
always be seen to exist in a state of union. A fish and water exist in a
state of union, Each, however, is different from the other. The same is
the case with Intelligence and Soul. The qualities do not know the Soul,
but the Soul knows them all. The Soul is the spectator of the qualities
and regards them all as proceeding from itself. The soul, acting through
the senses, the mind, and the understanding numbering as the seventh,
all of which are inactive and have no self-consciousness, discovers the
objects (amid which it exists) like a (covered) lamp showing all objects
around it by shedding its rays through an aperture in the covering. The
understanding or Intelligence creates all the qualities. The Soul only
beholds them (as a witness). Even such is certainly the connection
between the intelligence and the Soul. <span
id="fr_112"></span>[5](#fn_112.md) There is no refuge on which either
Intelligence or Soul depends.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The Understanding creates the mind, but never
the qualities. When the soul, by means of the mind, sufficiently
restrains the rays that emanate from the senses, it is then that it
becomes manifest (to the Understanding) like a lamp burning within a
vessel that covers it. That person who renounces all ordinary acts,
practises penances, devotes himself to study the Soul, taking a delight
therein, and regards himself as the Soul of all creatures, acquires a
high end. As an aquatic fowl, while moving over the waters, is never
drenched in that element, even thus does a person of wisdom move (in the
world) among creatures. By the aid of one's intelligence one should act
in the world after this fashion, without grief, without joy, with an
equal eye for all, and destitute of malice and envy. One living in this
way succeeds in creating the qualities (instead of being oneself
affected by them), like a spider creating threads. <span
id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md) The qualities should, indeed, be
regarded as the threads of the spider. Some say that the qualities in
respect of such men are not lost. Some say that they are all lost. Those
who say that they are not lost rely upon the revealed scriptures
(*viz*., the *Srutis*), which do not contain any declaration to the
contrary. They, on the other hand, who say that the qualities are all
lost rely on the *Smritis*. Reflecting upon both these opinions, one
should judge oneself as to which of them is right. One should thus get
over this hard and knotty question which is capable c f disturbing the
understanding by doubt, and thereby win happiness. When that doubt will
be removed, one will no longer have to indulge in sorrow of any kind.
Men of filthy hearts may by knowledge obtain success like persons
plunging in a well-filled stream purifying themselves of all filth. One
who has to cross a broad river does not feel happy at only seeing the
other shore. If the case were otherwise (*i.e.*, if by only beholding
the other shore one could reach it by a boat), then might one become
happy. The matter is otherwise with one acquainted with the Truth. The
mere knowledge of Truth will bring him happiness. As soon as such
knowledge begins to bear fruits, the person may be regarded to have
reached the other shore. They who thus know the Soul as freed from all
worldly objects and is but the One, are said to obtain high and
excellent knowledge. <span id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114.md) A person by
knowing the origin and the end of all creatures, which is even such, and
by reflecting upon the matter, gradually obtains infinite happiness. He
that has understood the triple aggregate (*viz*., that it is liable to
destruction instead of being eternal), and reflecting upon it, casts it
away, succeeds by *yoga* to behold the Truth and obtain perfect
felicity. The Soul is incapable of being seen unless the senses, which
are employed on diverse objects and are difficult of being controlled,
be all duly restrained. He that knows this is really wise. What other
indication is there of a wise man? Acquiring this knowledge, men
possessed of intelligence regard themselves to be crowned with success.
That which inspires the ignorant with fear can never inspire fear in
persons of Knowledge. There is no

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

higher end for anybody (than Emancipation). In consequence, however, of
the excess or otherwise of good qualities, the sages say that
differences are observable in respect of the degree of Emancipation. A
person by acting without expectation of fruits succeeds (by those acts)
in annihilating his sinful acts of a former period. To one possessed of
wisdom, the acts of a former period (thus washed off) and those of this
life also (which are accomplished without expectation of fruit), do not
become productive of any disagreeable consequence (such as immurement in
hell). But how can acts, if he continues to be engaged in accomplishing
acts, bring about what is agreeable (*viz*., Emancipation)? <span
id="fr_115"></span>[1](m12b022.htm#fn_115.md) People censure a person that
is afflicted (with lust, envy, and other evil passions). Those vices
hurl the person in his next life into diverse kinds of inferior
orders. <span id="fr_116"></span>[2](m12b022.htm#fn_116.md) Mark with close
attention the vicious in this world who grieve exceedingly for the loss
of their possessions (such as sons and wives, etc.). Behold also those
that are gifted with judgment and who never grieve when thrown into
similar circumstances. Those that are conversant with both (*i.e.*, with
gradual Emancipation and immediate Emancipation), deserve to be called
truly wise.'" <span id="fr_117"></span>[3](m12b022.htm#fn_117.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_100"></span>[45:4](m12b021.htm#fr_100.md) *Adhyatma* is
anything that depends on the mind. Here it is, as explained by the
commentator, used for *yoga-dharma* as depending upon or as an attribute
of the mind. Generally speaking, all speculations on the character of
the mind and its relations with external objects are included in the
word *Adhyatma*.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[45:5](m12b021.htm#fr_101.md) After Bhrigu's
discourse to Bharadwaja this question may seem to be a repetition. The
commentator explains that it arises from the declaration of Bhishma that
Righteousness is a property of the mind, and is, besides, the root of
everything. (V 31, sec. 193, *ante*). Hence the enquiry about *Adhyatma*
as also about the origin of all things.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[46:1](m12b021.htm#fr_102.md) The word rendering
'perceptions' is *Vijnanani*. 'Cognitions' would perhaps, be better.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[46:2](m12b021.htm#fr_103.md) Generally, in Hindu
philosophy, particularly of the Vedanta school, a distinction is
conceived between the mind, the understanding, and the soul. The mind is
the seat or source of all feelings and emotions as also all our
perceptions, or those which are called cognitions in the Kantian school,
including Comparison which (in the Kantian school) is called the Vernuft
or Reason. This last is called the Understanding or *buddhi*. The soul
is regarded as something distinct from both the body and the mind. It is
the Being to whom the body and the mind belong. It is represented as
inactive, and as the all-seeing witness within the physical frame. It is
a portion of the Supreme Soul.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[46:3](m12b021.htm#fr_104.md) Goodness includes
all the higher moral qualities of man. Passion means love, affection,
and other emotions that appertain to worldly objects. Darkness means
anger, lust, and such other mischievous propensities.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[47:1](m12b021.htm#fr_105.md) I follow Nilakantha
in his grammatical exposition of this verse. The meaning, however, is
scarcely clear. The identity of the Understanding or intelligence with
the senses and the mind may be allowed so far as the action of the three
qualities in leading all of them to worldly attachments is concerned.
But what is meant by the identity of the Understanding with all the
objects it comprehends? Does Bhishma preach Idealism here? If nothing
exists except as it exists in the Understanding, then, of course, with
the extinction of the Understanding, all things would come to an end.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[47:2](m12b021.htm#fr_106.md) Brown and other
followers of Reid, whether they understood Reid or not, regarded all the
perceptions as only particular modifications of the mind. They denied
the objective existence of the world.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[47:3](m12b021.htm#fr_107.md) The commentator
explains this verse thus, although as regards the second line he
stretches it a little. If Nilakantha be right, K.P. Singha must be
wrong. Generally, however, it is the known incapacity of the ocean to
transgress its continents that supplies poets with illustrations. Here,
however, possibly, the rarity of the phenomenon, *viz*., the ocean's
transgressing its continents, is used to illustrate the rare fact of the
intelligence, succeeding by *yoga* power, in transcending the attributes
of *Rajas*, *Tamas* and *Sattwa*.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[48:1](m12b021.htm#fr_108.md) on the other hand,
directing one's thoughts boldly to it, one should ascertain its cause
and dispel that cause, which, as stated here, is Passion.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[48:2](m12b021.htm#fr_109.md) The first two words
of the second line are those of verse 5 of See, I, Manu.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[48:3](m12b021.htm#fr_110.md) *Kathanchit* is
explained by Nilakantha as 'due to great ill-luck.'

<span id="fn_111"></span>[48:4](m12b021.htm#fr_111.md) I do not follow
Nilakantha in rendering this verse.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[48:5](m12b021.htm#fr_112.md) The soul is said to
be only a witness or spectator and not an actor. The *Rishis* understood
by the soul the being to whom the mind, the senses, etc., all belong.
Could the idea of the inactive and unsinning Soul have arisen from
observation of the moral principle of Conscience which discriminates
between right and wrong, and acts, therefore, as an impartial judge, or
watches everything like an uninterested spectator? European moralists
generally attribute two other functions to the Conscience, *viz*.,
impelling us to do the right and avoid the wrong, and approving when
right is done and wrong avoided. But these functions may easily be
attributed to some other principle. At any rate, when the question is
one of nomenclature only, the last two functions may be taken away and
the word Soul applied to indicate the Conscience as the faculty of
discrimination only.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[49:1](m12b021.htm#fr_113.md) The qualities here
referred to are those of *Sattwa* (goodness), *Rajas* (passion), and
*Tamas* (darkness). What is meant by this verse is that such a person
transcends the qualities instead of the qualities transcending him and
his acts.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[49:2](m12b021.htm#fr_114.md) Nilakantha takes the
third line as elliptical and is for supplying *te labhante*.
