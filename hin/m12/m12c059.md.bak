### SECTION CCCLX

"The Naga said, 'O thou of sweet smiles, for whom hast thou taken that
Brahmana? Is he really a human being or is he some deity that has come
hither in the disguise of a Brahmana? O thou of great fame, who is there
among human beings that would be desirous of seeing me or that would be
competent for the purpose? Can a human being, desiring to see me, leave
such a command with thee about [dispatching](errata.htm#241.md) me to him
for paying him a visit at the place where he is dwelling? Amongst the
deities and Asuras and celestial Rishis, O amiable lady, the Nagas are
endued with great energy. Possessed of great speed, they are endued
again with excellent fragrance. They deserve to be worshipped. They are
capable of granting boons. Indeed, we too deserve to be followed by
others in our train. I tell thee, O lady, that we are incapable of being
seen by human beings.' <span id="fr_350"></span>[2](#fn_350.md)

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

"The spouse of the Naga chief said, 'Judging by his simplicity and
candour I know that that Brahmana is not any deity who subsists on air.
O thou of great wrath, I also know this, *viz*., that he reveres thee
with all his heart. His heart is set upon the accomplishment of some
object that depends upon thy aid. As the bird called Chataka, which is
fond of rain, waits in earnest expectation of a shower (for slaking its
thirst), even so is that Brahmana waiting in expectation of a meeting
with thee. <span id="fr_351"></span>[1](#fn_351.md) Let no calamity betake
him in consequence of his inability to obtain a sight of thee. No person
born like thee in a respectable family can be regarded to remain
respectable by neglecting a guest arrived at his house. <span
id="fr_352"></span>[2](#fn_352.md) Casting off that wrath which is natural
to thee, it behoveth thee to go and see that Brahmana. It behoveth thee
not to suffer thyself to be consumed by disappointing that Brahmana. The
king or the prince, by refusing to wipe the tears of persons that come
to him from hopes of relief, incurs the sin of foeticide. By abstaining
from speech one attains to wisdom. By practising gifts one acquires
great fame. By adhering to truthfulness of speech, one acquires the gift
of eloquence and comes to be honoured in heaven. By giving away land one
attains to that high end which is ordained for Rishis leading the sacred
mode of life. By earning wealth through righteous means, one succeeds in
attaining to many desirable fruits. By doing in its entirety what is
beneficial for oneself, one can avoid going to hell. That is what the
righteous say.

"The Naga said, 'I had no arrogance due to pride. In consequence,
however, of my birth, the measure of my arrogance was considerable. Of
wrath, which is born of desire, O blessed lady, I have none. It has all
been consumed by the fire of thy excellent instructions. I do not
behold, O blessed dame, any darkness that is thicker than wrath. In
consequence, however, of the Naga having excess of wrath, they have
become object of reproach with all persons. <span
id="fr_353"></span>[3](#fn_353.md) By succumbing to the influence of wrath,
the ten-headed Ravana of great prowess, became the rival of Sakra and
was for that reason slain by Rama in battle. Hearing that the Rishi Rama
of Bhrigu's race had entered the inner apartments of their palace for
bringing away the calf of the Homa cow of their sire, the sons of
Karttaviryya, yielding to wrath, took such entry as an insult

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

to their royal house, and as the consequence thereof, they met with
destruction at the hands of Rama. Indeed, Karttaviryya of great
strength, resembling the Thousand-eyed Indra himself, in consequence of
his having yielded to wrath, was slain in battle by Rama of Jamadagni's
race. Verily, O amiable lady at thy words I have restrained my wrath,
that foe of penances that destroyer of all that is beneficial for
myself. I praise my own self greatly since, O large-eyed one, I am
fortunate enough to own thee for my wife,--thee that are possessed of
every virtue and that hast inexhaustible merits. I shall now proceed to
that spot where the Brahmana is staying. I shall certainly address that
Brahmana in proper words and he shall certainly go hence, his wishes
being accomplished."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_350"></span>[211:2](m12c059.htm#fr_350.md) The meaning of
*annyayinah* is that we should be followed by others, *i.e.*, we deserve
to walk at the head of others.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[212:1](m12c059.htm#fr_351.md) The Indian bird
*Chataka* has a natural hole on the upper part of its long neck in
consequence of which it is seen to always sit with beaks upturned, so
that the upper part of the neck keeps the hole covered. The *Chataka* is
incapable of slaking its thirst in a lake or river, for it cannot bend
its neck down. Rain water is what it must drink. Its cry is shrill and
sharp but not without sweetness. 'Phate-e-ek-jal' is supposed to be the
cry uttered by it. When the Chataka cries, the hearers expect rain.
Eager expectation with respect to anything is always compared to the
Chataka's expectation of rain water.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[212:2](m12c059.htm#fr_352.md) The Burdwan
translator erroneously renders this verse. The commentator explains that
*hitwa* is equivalent to *vina* and sums up the meaning of the first
line in these words, *viz*., *twaddarsanam vina asya kopi vighnomabhut*.
In the second line, *naprayupasate* is equal to *paritajya na aste*.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[212:3](m12c059.htm#fr_353.md) It is a pity that
even such verses have not been rendered correctly by the Burdwan
translator. K. P. Singha gives the sense correctly, but the translation
is not accurate.
