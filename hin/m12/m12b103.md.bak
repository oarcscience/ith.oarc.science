### SECTION CCLXXVI

"Yudhishthira said, 'Cruel and sinful that we are, alas, we have slain
brothers and sires and grandsons and kinsmen and friends and sons. How,
O grandsire, shall we dispel this thirst for wealth. Alas, through that
thirst we have perpetrated many sinful deeds.'

"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of what
was said by the ruler of the Videhas unto the enquiring Mandavya. The
ruler of the Videhas said, 'I have nothing (in this world), yet I live
in great happiness. If the whole of Mithila (which is said to be my
kingdom) burn in a conflagration, nothing of mine will be burnt down.
Tangible possessions, however valuable, are a source of sorrow to men of
knowledge; while possessions of even little value fascinate the
foolish. <span id="fr_820"></span>[2](#fn_820.md) Whatever happiness exists
here, derivable from the gratification of desire, and whatever heavenly
happiness exists of high value, do not come up to even a sixteenth part
of the felicity that attends the total disappearance of desire. As the
horns of a cow grow with the growth of the cow itself, after the same
manner the thirst for wealth increases with increasing
[acquisitions](errata.htm#124.md) of wealth. Whatever the object for which
one feels an attachment, that object becomes a source of pain when it is
lost. One

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

should not cherish desire. Attachment to desire leads to sorrow. When
wealth has been acquired, one should apply it to purposes of virtue. One
should even then give up desire. <span id="fr_821"></span>[1](#fn_821.md)
The man of knowledge always looks upon other creatures even as he looks
upon himself. Having cleansed his soul and attained to success, he casts
off everything here. <span id="fr_822"></span>[2](#fn_822.md) By casting
off both truth and falsehood, grief and joy, the agreeable and
disagreeable, fearlessness and fear, one attains to tranquillity, and
becomes free from every anxiety. That thirst (for earthly things) which
is difficult of being cast off by men of foolish understanding, which
wanes not with the wane of the body, and which is regarded as a fatal
disease (by men of knowledge), one who succeeds in casting off is sure
to find felicity. The man of virtuous soul, by beholding his own
behaviour that has become bright as the moon and free from evil of every
kind, succeeds in happily attaining to great fame both here and
hereafter.' Hearing these words of the king, the Brahmana became filled
with joy, and applauding what he heard, Mandavya betook himself to the
path of Emancipation.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_820"></span>[285:2](m12b103.htm#fr_820.md) The commentator
points out that possessions of value include even the region of Brahman.
Men of knowledge, who seek Emancipation, do not set any value on even
the joy of the region of the Creator.

<span id="fn_821"></span>[286:1](m12b103.htm#fr_821.md) The commentator
explains that one should not cherish 'the desire for wealth even for the
sake of acquiring virtue therewith. When, however, wealth is obtained
without effort, such wealth should be applied to the acquisition of
virtue. One is also directed to give up the desire of acquiring wealth
(by even innocent means) the reason being that desire, when cherished,
is sure to increase and get the better of one's heart.

<span id="fn_822"></span>[286:2](m12b103.htm#fr_822.md) The commentator
observes that the first line means that the man of knowledge should wish
for happiness to all, and never wish sorrow to any one. *Sarvam*
includes virtue and vice. Of course, the practice of *nishkama dharma*
is recommended.
