### SECTION CCXXXVII

"Vyasa said, 'Borne up and down in life's ocean, he that is capable of
meditation seizes the raft of Knowledge and for achieving his
Emancipation adheres to Knowledge itself (without extending his arms
hither and thither for catching any other support).' <span
id="fr_419"></span>[6](#fn_419.md)

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

"Suka said, 'What is that Knowledge? Is it that learning by which, when
error is dispelled, the truth becomes discovered? Or, is it that course
of duties consisting of acts to be done or achieved, by the aid of which
the object sought may be understood or attained? Or, is it that course
of duties, called abstention from acts, by which an
[extension](errata.htm#95.md) of the Soul is to be sought? Do tell me what
it is, so that by its aid, the two, *viz*., birth and death, may be
avoided.' <span id="fr_420"></span>[1](#fn_420.md)

"Vyasa said, 'That fool who believing that all this exists in
consequence of its own nature without, in fact, an existent refuge or
foundation, fills by such instruction the aspirations of disciples,
dispelling by his dialectical ingenuity the reasons the latter might
urge to the contrary, succeeds not in attaining to any truth. <span
id="fr_421"></span>[2](#fn_421.md) They again who firmly believe that all
Cause is due to the nature of things, fail to acquire any truth by even
listening to (wiser) men or the *Rishis* (who are capable of instructing
them). <span id="fr_422"></span>[3](#fn_422.md) Those men of little
intelligence who stop (in their speculations), having adopted either of
these doctrines, indeed, those men who regard nature as the cause, never
succeed in obtaining any benefit for themselves. <span
id="fr_423"></span>[4](#fn_423.md) This belief in Nature (as the producing
and the sustaining Cause), arising as it does from a mind acting under
the influence of error, brings about the destruction of the person who
cherishes it. Listen now to the truth with respect to these two
doctrines that maintain (1) that things exist by their own nature and
(2) that they flow (in consequence of their own nature) from others that
are different from and that precede them. <span
id="fr_424"></span>[5](#fn_424.md) Wise men apply themselves to agriculture
and tillage, and the acquisition of crops (by those means) and of
vehicles (for locomotion) and seats and carpets and houses. They attend
also to the laying of pleasure-gardens, the construction of commodious
mansions, and the preparation of

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

medicines, for diseases of every kind. It is wisdom (which consists in
the application of means) that leads to the fruition of purposes. It is
wisdom that wins beneficial results. It is wisdom that enables kings to
exercise and enjoy sovereignty although they are possessed of attributes
equal to those of persons over whom they rule. <span
id="fr_425"></span>[1](#fn_425.md) It is by wisdom that the high and the
low among beings are distinguished. It is by wisdom that the superior
and the inferior ones among created objects are understood. It is wisdom
or knowledge that is the highest refuge of all things. <span
id="fr_426"></span>[2](#fn_426.md) All the diverse kinds of created things
have four kinds of birth. They are viviparous, oviparous, vegetables,
and those born of filth. Creatures, again, that are mobile should be
known to be superior to those that are immobile. It is consistent with
reason that intelligent energy, inasmuch as it differentiates (all
non-intelligent matter), should be regarded as superior
to.(non-intelligent) matter. <span id="fr_427"></span>[3](#fn_427.md)
Mobile creatures, that are innumerable, and of two kinds, *viz*., those
that have many legs and those that have two. The latter, however, are
superior to the former. Bipeds, again are of two species, *viz*., those
that live on land and those that are otherwise. Of these, the former are
superior to the latter. The superior ones eat diverse kinds of cooked
food. <span id="fr_428"></span>[4](#fn_428.md) Bipeds moving on land are of
two kinds *viz*., middling or intermediate, and those that are foremost.
Of these, the middling or intermediate are regarded as superior (to the
former) in consequence of their observance of the duties of caste. <span
id="fr_429"></span>[5](#fn_429.md) The middling or intermediate ones are
said to be of two kinds, *viz*., those that are conversant with duties,
and those that are otherwise. Of those, the former are superior in
consequence of their discrimination in respect of what should be done
and what should not. Those conversant with duties are said to be of two
kinds, *viz*., those

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

that are acquainted with the Vedas and those that are otherwise. Of
these the former are superior, for the Vedas are said to dwell in
them. <span id="fr_430"></span>[1](#fn_430.md) Those that are acquainted
with the Vedas are said to be of two kinds, *viz*., those that lecture
on the Vedas and those that are otherwise. Of these, the former, who are
fully conversant with the Vedas, with the duties and the rites laid down
in them, and the fruits of those duties and rites, are superior in
consequence of their publishing all those duties and rites. Indeed, all
the Vedas with the duties laid down in them are said to flow from them.
Preceptors of the Vedas are of two kinds, *viz*., those that are
conversant with the Soul and those that are otherwise. Of these, the
former are superior in consequence of their knowledge of what is meant
by Birth and Death. <span id="fr_431"></span>[2](#fn_431.md) As regards
duties, they are, again, of two kinds (*viz*., Pravritti and Nivritti).
He who is conversant with duties is said to be omniscient or possessed
of universal knowledge. Such a man is a Renouncer. Such a man is firm in
the accomplishment of his purposes. Such a man is truthful, pure (both
outwardly and inwardly), and possessed of puissance. <span
id="fr_432"></span>[3](#fn_432.md) The gods know him for a Brahmana who is
devoted to knowledge of Brahma (and not him who is conversant with only
the duties of Pravritti). Such a man is versed also in the Vedas and
earnestly devoted to the study of the Soul. <span
id="fr_433"></span>[4](#fn_433.md) They that have true knowledge behold
their own Soul as existing both in and out. Such men, O child, are truly
regenerate and such men are gods. <span id="fr_434"></span>[5](#fn_434.md)
Upon these rests this world of Beings, in them dwell this whole
universe. There is nothing that is equal to their greatness.
Transcending birth and death and distinctions and acts of every kind,
they are the lords of the four kinds of creatures and are the equals of
the Self-born himself.'" <span id="fr_435"></span>[6](#fn_435.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_419"></span>[172:6](m12b064.htm#fr_419.md) *Brahmanam* is
*arsha* for *Brahmam*.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[173:1](m12b064.htm#fr_420.md) I follow
Nilakantha's gloss in rendering the words *Vidya*, *Pravritti* and
*Nivritti*, as used in this verse. By the first, the commentator thinks,
is meant that course of instruction in consequence of which error may be
dispelled and truth acquired. The usual illustration of the cord and the
snake is given. The former maybe mistaken for the latter, but when the
mistake ceases, correct apprehension follows. Pravritti has been
sufficiently indicated in the text in which the words of the gloss has
been incorporated. By Nivritti is meant the doctrine of the Sunyavadins
and Lokayatikas (evidently the Buddhists) who seek annihilation or
extinction as the only true Emancipation. Both the Vernacular
translators are wrong. The Burdwan translator, as usual, citing the very
words of the gloss, misunderstands them completely.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[173:2](m12b064.htm#fr_421.md) The construction of
the first line is '*yastu achetanah bhavam vina swabhavena* (sarvam
bhati iti) *pasyan*, etc., etc., *pushyate* (sa na kinchana labhate).'
Bhavan is explained as 'adhishthanasattam.' The commentator is of
opinion that the speaker refers in this verse to the Sunyavadins.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[173:3](m12b064.htm#fr_422.md) The Bombay text
reads *Putwatrinamishikamva*.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[173:4](m12b064.htm#fr_423.md) *Enam* is singular.
The commentator thinks it should be taken distributively. In verse 3,
the doctrine of the Nihilists (Sunyavadins) has been referred to. In
verse 4, that of the Lokayatikas. In both, Nature is spoken of as the
cause, with this difference that the former regard the universe to be
only an erroneous impression of an existent entity, while the latter
regard it as a real entity flowing from and manifesting itself under its
own nature. Both doctrines, the speaker says, are false.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[173:5](m12b064.htm#fr_424.md) Both the Vernacular
translators skip over the word *paribhava* in the second line of verse
<span id="page_174">p. 174</span> 6. The commentator correctly explains
that *swabhava* in 6 means *swasyaiva bhavah sattakaranam iti, ekah
pakshah*. *Paribhava*, he explains is *paritah swasya itaresham bhavah*.
The first refers to the Nihilists, the second to the Lokayatikas or to
verses 3 and 4 respectively.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[174:1](m12b064.htm#fr_425.md) It is by the wisdom
that all these results are achieved. Wisdom is the application of means
for the accomplishment of ends. Nature, never rears palaces or produces
vehicles and the diverse other comforts that man enjoys. He that would
rely upon Nature for these would never obtain them however long he might
wait. The need for exertion, both mental and physical, and the success
which crowns that exertion furnish the best answer, the speaker thinks,
to both the Nihilist sand the Lokayatikas. The word *tulyalakshanah* is
skipped over by both the Bengali translators.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[174:2](m12b064.htm#fr_426.md) By *para* is meant
the *Chit* or Soul, by *avara*, all else, *i.e.*, non-ego or matter. The
words *Prajna*, *Jnana*, and *Vidya* are all as used here, equivalent.
The second line of this verse is wrongly rendered by both the Bengali
translators, the Burdwan translator, as usual, not understanding the
words of the gloss he quotes.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[174:3](m12b064.htm#fr_427.md) It is difficult to
render the word *cheshta* as used here. Ordinarily it implies effort or
action. It is plain, however, that here it stands for intelligent
energy, implying both mental and physical effort or action, for its
function is to distinguish or differentiate.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[174:4](m12b064.htm#fr_428.md) The *itarani* do
not refer to *Pisachas* as rendered by K.P. Singha, but to birds which
are called *Khechare* or denizens of the sky or air. Khechara may
include Pisachas, but these are also *Bhuchara* or denizens of the
surface of the earth.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[174:5](m12b064.htm#fr_429.md) The commentator
explains that for ascertaining who are *uttama* or foremost, the
middling, <span id="page_175">p. 175</span> or intermediate ones are
first spoken of and their distinctions mentioned in the following
verses. Of course, the foremost are foremost, and the intermediate ones
can never be superior to them. For all that, intermediate ones are
observers of the duties of caste; the foremost ones are not so, they
having transcended such distinctions; hence, tentatively, the ignorant
or popular opinion is first taken, to the effect that the observers of
caste are superior to those who do not observe *Jatidharma*.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[175:1](m12b064.htm#fr_430.md) This probably means
that as the Vedas had not been reduced to writing, their contents rested
or dwelt in memories of men versed in them.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[175:2](m12b064.htm#fr_431.md) To understand what
is birth and what is death, and to avoid birth (add, therefore, death),
are the highest fruits of knowledge of the Soul. Those that have no
knowledge of the Soul have to travel in a round of repeated rebirths.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[175:3](m12b064.htm#fr_432.md) *i.e.*, of power
that comes of Yoga.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[175:4](m12b064.htm#fr_433.md) The word *para*
(the locative form of which is used here) always means that which is
high or foremost. It is frequently employed to mean either *Brahma* or
the Soul, and as Soul is regarded to be apart of *Brahma*, *para* has
but one and the same meaning. The Burdwan translator takes it for
'Scriptures other than the Vedas.' K.P. Singha skips over it. Of course,
*savda-Brahma* stands for the Vedas.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[175:5](m12b064.htm#fr_434.md) To look upon
everything in the universe as one's own. Soul is the highest aspiration
of a righteous person. It is *yoga* that enables one to attain to this
highest ideal of existence. One who realises this is said to be a true
Brahmana, a really regenerate person, in fact, a god on Earth.
*Adhiyajna* and *Adhidaivata* are words that signify the Soul.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[175:6](m12b064.htm#fr_435.md) What the
distinction is between *anta* and *nidhan* is not obvious. The
commentator is <span id="page_176">p. 176</span> silent. K.P. Singha
translates the verse correctly. The Burdwan translator makes utter
nonsense of the words in the second line.
