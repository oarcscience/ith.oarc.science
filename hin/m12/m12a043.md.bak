### SECTION XLIV

"Vaisampayana said, 'Having got back the kingdom, king Yudhishthira of
great wisdom and purity, after the ceremony of installation had been
over, joining his hands together, addressed the lotus-eyed Krishna of
Dasarha's race, saying, 'Through thy grace, O Krishna, through thy
policy and might and intelligence and prowess, O tiger among the Yadus,
I have got back this ancestral kingdom of mine. O thou of eyes like
lotus leaves, I repeatedly bow to thee, O chastiser of foes! Thou hast
been called the One only Being. Thou hast been said to be the refuge of
all worshippers. The regenerate ones adore

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

thee under innumerable names. <span id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_126.md)
Salutations to thee, O Creator of the Universe! Thou art the soul of the
Universe and the Universe hath sprung from thee. Thou art Vishnu, thou
art Jishnu, thou art Hari, thou art Krishna, thou art Vaikuntha, and
thou art the foremost of all beings. Thou hast, as said in the
*Puranas*, taken thy birth seven times in the womb of Aditi. It was thou
that tookest birth in the womb of Prishni. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[2](#fn_127.md) The learned say that thou art the three
*Yugas*. <span id="fr_128"></span>[3](#fn_128.md) All thy achievements are
sacred. Thou art the lord of our senses. Thou art the great Lord
worshipped in sacrifices. Thou art called the great swan. Thou art
three-eyed Sambhu. Thou art One, though known as Vibhu and Damodara.
Thou art the great Boar, thou art Fire, thou art the Sun, thou hast the
bull for the device on thy banner, and thou hast Garuda also as thy
device. Thou art the grinder of hostile hosts, thou art the Being that
pervadest every form in the universe and thou art of irresistible
prowess. Thou art the foremost of all things, thou art fierce, thou art
the generalissimo in battle, thou art the Truth, thou art the giver of
food, and thou art Guha (the celestial generalissimo); Thyself unfading,
thou causest thy foes to fade and waste. Thou art the Brahmana of pure
blood, and thou art those that have sprung from intermixture. Thou art
great. Thou walkest on high, thou art the mountains, and thou art called
*Vrishadarbha* and *Vrishakapi*. Thou art the Ocean, thou art without
attributes, thou hast three humps, thou hast three abodes, and thou
takest human forms on earth, descending from heaven. Thou art Emperor,
thou art *Virat*, and thou art *Swarat*. <span
id="fr_129"></span>[4](#fn_129.md) Thou art the Chief of the celestials,
and thou art the cause whence the Universe has sprung. Thou art
Almighty, thou art existence in every form, thou art without form, thou
art Krishna, and thou art fire. Thou art the Creator, thou art the sire
of the celestial physicians, thou art (the sage) Kapila, and thou art
the Dwarf. <span id="fr_130"></span>[5](#fn_130.md) Thou art Sacrifice
embodied, thou art Dhruva, <span id="fr_131"></span>[6](#fn_131.md) thou
art Garuda, and thou art called *Yajnasena*. Thou art Sikhandin, thou
art Nahusha, and thou art Vabhru. Thou art the constellation *Punarvasu*
extended in the firmament, Thou art exceedingly tawny in hue, thou art
the sacrifice known by the name of *Uktha*, thou art Sushena, thou art
the drum (that sends forth its sound on every side). The track of thy
car-wheels is light. Thou art the lotus of Prosperity, thou art the
cloud called *Pushkara*, and thou art decked with floral wreaths. Thou
art affluent, thou art puissant, thou art the most subtle, and it is
thou whom the *Vedas* describe. Thou art the great receptacle of waters,
thou art Brahman, thou art the sacred refuge, and thou knowest the
abodes of all. Thou art called *Hiranyagarbha*, thou art the sacred
mantras *swadha* 

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

and *swaha*, thou art Kesava. Thou art the cause whence all this hath
sprung, and thou art its dissolution. In the beginning it is thou that
createst the universe. This universe is under thy control, O Creator of
the universe! Salutations to thee, O wielder of *Sarnga*, discus and
sword!' Thus hymned by king Yudhishthira the just in the midst of the
court, the lotus-eyed Krishna became pleased. That foremost one of the
Yadavas then began to gladden the eldest son of Pandu with many
agreeable speeches."
