### SECTION CXXXII

"Yudhishthira said, 'When practices fraught with high morality and
beneficial to the world, (*viz*., those that appertain to righteous
rule) disappear, when all the means and resources for the support of
life fall into the hands of robbers, when, indeed, such a calamitous
time sets in, by what means should a Brahmana, O grandsire, who from
affection is unable to desert his sons and grandsons, subsist?'

"Bhishma said, 'When such a time sets in, the Brahmana should live by
the aid of knowledge. Everything in this world is for them that are
good. Nothing here is for them that are wicked. He who making himself an
instrument of acquisition, takes wealth from the wicked and gives it
unto them that are good, is said to be conversant with the morality of
adversity. Desirous of maintaining his rule, the king, O monarch,
without driving his subjects to indignation and rebellion, may take what
is not freely given by the owner, saying, '*This is mine*!' That wise
man who, cleansed by the possession of knowledge and might and of
righteous conduct at other times, acts censurably in such season, does
not really deserve to be censured. They who always support themselves by
putting forth their might never like any other method of living. They
that are endued with might, O Yudhishthira, always live by the aid of
prowess. The ordinary scriptures, that exist (for seasons of distress)

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

without exceptions of any kind, should be practised by a king (at such
times). A king, however, that is endued with intelligence, while
following those scriptures, would do something more. <span
id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_397.md) At such times, however, the king should
not oppress, *Ritwijas*, and *Purohitas* and preceptors and Brahmanas,
all of whom are honoured and held in high esteem. By oppressing them,
even at such times, he incurs reproach and sin. This that I tell thee is
regarded as an authority in the world. Indeed, this is the eternal eye
(by which practices in seasons of distress are to be viewed). One should
be guided by his authority. By this is to be judged whether a king is to
be called good or wicked. It is seen that many persons residing in
villages and towns, actuated by jealousy and wrath, accuse one another.
The king should never, at their words, honour or punish anybody. Slander
should never be spoken. If spoken, it should never be heard. When
slanderous converse goes on, one should close one's ears or leave the
place outright. Slanderous converse is the characteristic of wicked men.
It is an indication of depravity. They, on the other hand, O king, who
speak of the virtues of others in assemblies of the good, are good men.
As a pair of sweet-tempered bulls governable and well-broken and used to
bear burthens, put their necks to the yoke and drag the cart willingly,
even so should the king bear his burthens (in seasons of distress).
Others say that a king (at such times) should conduct himself in such a
way that he may succeed in gaining a large number of allies. Some regard
ancient usage as the highest indication of righteousness. Others,
*viz*., they that are in favour of the conduct pursued by Sankha,
towards Likhita, do not hold this opinion. They do not advance such an
opinion through either malice or covetousness <span
id="fr_399"></span>[2](#fn_398.md). Examples are seen of even great
*Rishis* who have laid down that even preceptors, if addicted to evil
practices, should be punished. But approvable authority there is none
for such a proposition. The gods may be left to punish such men when
they happen to be vile and guilty of wicked practices. The king who
fills his treasury by having recourse to fraudulent devices, certainly
falls away from righteousness. The code of morality which is honoured in
every respect by those that are good and in affluent circumstances, and
which is approved by every honest heart,

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

should be followed. He is said to be conversant with duty who knows duty
as depending on all the four foundations. It is difficult to find out
the reasons on which duties stand even as it is difficult to find out
the legs of the snake. <span id="fr_400"></span>[1](#fn_399.md) As a hunter
of beasts discovers the track of a shaft-struck deer by observing spots
of blood on the ground, even so should one seek to discover the reasons
of duties. This should a man tread with humility along the path trod by
the good. Such, indeed, was the conduct of the great royal sages of old,
O Yudhishthira!'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_397"></span>[285:1](m12a131.htm#fr_398.md) The commentator
explains it in the following way. The ordinary texts, without exceptions
of any kind, laid down for seasons of distress, permit a king to fill
his treasury by levying heavy contributions on both his own subjects and
those of hostile kingdoms. An ordinary king, at such a time, acts in
this way. A king, however, that is endued with intelligence, while
levying such contributions, takes care to levy them upon those that are
wicked and punishable among his own subjects and among the subjects of
other kingdoms, and refrains from molesting the good. Compare the
conduct of Warren Hastings in exacting a heavy tribute, when his own
treasury was empty, from Cheyt Singh, whose unfriendliness for the
British power was a matter of notoriety.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[285:2](m12a131.htm#fr_399.md) The sense seems to
be that there are persons who hold that priests and Brahmanas should
never be punished or taxed. This is the eternal usage, and, therefore,
this is morality. Others who approve of the conduct of Sankha towards
his brother Likhita on the occasion of the latter's appropriating a few
fruits belonging to the former, are of a different opinion. The latter
class of persons Bhishma says, are as sincere as the former in their
opinion. They cannot be blamed for holding that even priests and
Brahmanas may be punished when offending.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[286:1](m12a131.htm#fr_400.md) *Duty depending on
all the four foundations*, *i.e.*, as laid down in the Vedas; as laid
down in the *Smritis*; as sanctioned by ancient usages and customs; and
as approved by the heart or one's own conscience.
