"Parasara said, 'In the Brahmana, wealth acquired by acceptance of
gifts, in the Kshatriya that won by victory in battle, in the Vaisya
that obtained by

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

following the duties laid down for his order, and in the Sudra that
earned by serving the three other orders, however small its measure, is
worthy of praise, and spent for the acquisition of virtue is productive
of great benefits. The Sudra is said to be the constant servitor of the
three other classes. If the Brahmana, pressed for a living, betakes
himself to the duties of either the Kshatriya or the Vaisya, he does not
fall off from righteousness. When, however, the Brahmana betakes himself
to the duties of the lowest order, then does he certainly fall off. When
the Sudra is unable to obtain his living by service of the three other
orders, then trade, rearing of cattle, and the practice of the
mechanical arts are lawful for him to follow. Appearance on the boards
of a theatre and disguising oneself in various forms, exhibition of
puppets, the sale of spirits and meat, and trading in iron and leather,
should never be taken up for purposes of a living by one who had never
before been engaged in those professions every one of which is regarded
as censurable in the world. It hath been heard by us that if one engaged
in them can abandon them, one then acquires great merit. When one that
has become successful in life behaves sinfully in consequence of one's
mind being filled with arrogance, one's acts under such circumstances
can never pass for authority. It is heard in the Puranas that formerly
mankind were self-restrained; that they held righteousness in great
esteem; that the practices they followed for livelihood were all
consistent with propriety and the injunctions laid down in the
scriptures: and that the only punishment that was required for
chastising them when they went wrong was the crying of fie on
them. <span id="fr_1025"></span>[1](#fn_1025.md) At the time of which we
speak, O king, Righteousness, and nothing else, was much applauded among
men. Having achieved great progress in righteousness, men in those days
worshipped only all good qualities that they saw. The *Asuras*, however,
O child, could not bear that righteousness which prevailed in the world.
Multiplying (in both number and energy), the Asuras (in the form of Lust
and Wrath) entered the bodies of men. Then was pride generated in men
that is so destructive of righteousness. From pride arose arrogance, and
from arrogance arose wrath. When men thus became overwhelmed with wrath,
conduct implying modesty and shame disappeared from them, and then they
were overcome by heedlessness. Afflicted by heedlessness, they could no
longer see as before, and as the consequence thereof they began to
oppress one another and thereby acquire wealth without any compunction.
When men became such, the punishment of only crying fie on offenders
failed to be of any effect. Men, showing no reverence for either the
gods or Brahmanas, began to indulge their senses to their fill. <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[2](#fn_1026.md) At that time the deities

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

repaired to that foremost of gods, *viz*., Siva, possessed of patience,
of multiform aspect, and endued with the foremost of attributes, and
sought his protection. The deities imparted unto him their conjoined
energy, and thereupon the great god, with a single shaft, felled on the
earth those three Asuras, *viz*., Desire, Wrath, and Cupidity, who were
staying in the firmament, along with their very habitations. <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[1](#fn_1027.md) The fierce chief of those Asuras
possessed of fierce, prowess, who had struck the Devas with terror, was
also slain by Mahadeva armed with the lance. <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[2](#fn_1028.md) When this chief of the Asuras was
slain, men once more obtained their proper natures, and once more began
to study the Vedas and the other scriptures as was in former times. Then
the seven ancient Rishis came forward and installed Vasava as the chief
of the gods and the ruler of heaven. And they took upon themselves the
task of holding the rod of chastisement over mankind. After the seven
Rishis came king Viprithu (to rule mankind), and many other kings, all
belonging to the Kshatriya order for separately ruling separate groups
of human beings. (When Mahadeva dispelled all evil passions from the
minds of creatures) there were, in those ancient times, certain elderly
men from whose minds all wicked feelings did not fly away. Hence, in
consequence of that wicked state of their minds and of those incidents
that were connected with it, there appeared many kings of terrible
prowess who began to indulge in only such acts as were fit for Asuras.
Those human beings that are exceedingly foolish adhere to those wicked
acts, establish them as authorities, and follow them in practice to this
day. <span id="fr_1029"></span>[3](#fn_1029.md) For this reason, O king, I
say unto thee, having reflected properly with the aid of the scriptures,
that one should abstain from all acts that are fraught with injury or
malice and seek to acquire a knowledge of the Soul. <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[4](#fn_1030.md)The man possessed of wisdom would not
seek wealth for the performance of religious rites by ways that are
unrighteous and that involve an abandonment of morality. Wealth earned
by such means can never prove beneficial. Do thou then become a
Kshatriya of this kind. Do thou restrain thy senses, be agreeable to thy
friends, and cherish, according to the duties of thy order, thy
subjects, servants, and children. Through the union of both prosperity
and adversity (in man's life), there arise friendships and animosities.

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Thousands and thousands of existences are
continually revolving (in respect of every Jiva), and in every mode of
Jiva's existence these must occur. <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[1](#fn_1031.md) For this reason, be thou attached to
good qualities of every kind, but never to faults. Such is the character
of good qualities that if the most foolish person, bereft of every
virtue, hears himself praised for any good quality, he becomes filled
with joy. Virtue and sin exist, O king, only among men. These do not
exist among creatures other than man. One should therefore, whether in
need of food and other necessaries of life or transcending such need, be
of virtuous disposition, acquire knowledge, always look upon all
creatures as one's own self, and abstain totally from inflicting any
kind of injury. When one's mind becomes divested of desire, and when all
Darkness is dispelled from it, it is then that one succeeds in obtaining
what is auspicious.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1025"></span>[354:1](m12b122.htm#fr_1025.md) The Burdwan
translator gives a most ridiculous version of the expression
*Dhigdandasasanah*. Unable to catch the sense, which however is
certainly very plain, he actually interprets the words to mean 'living
under the sway of *king Dhigdanda*.' K.P. Singha gives the correct
meaning.

<span id="fn_1026"></span>[354:2](m12b122.htm#fr_1026.md) In this verse
also, the Burdwan translator takes *Dhigdanda* as the name of a king. He
gives an equally ridiculous version of the second line. *Abhyagachchan*
is explained by the commentator as having *vishayan* understood after
it. The sense is that they began to enjoy all objects of the senses to
an excess. Both *Devan* and *Brahman* are accusatives governed by
*Avamanya*. K.P. Singha translates both the lines correctly.

<span id="fn_1027"></span>[355:1](m12b122.htm#fr_1027.md) This verse is
taken as a metaphorical statement. The three Asuras are, of course,
*Kama*, *Krodha*, and *Lobha*. *Gaganagah* (staying in the firmament) is
interpreted as 'existing in *Maya*'. *Sapurah* as 'with their gross,
subtile, and potential forms;' 'felled on the earth is explained as
'merged into the pure chit.' The whole is taken to imply a spiritual
destruction of all the evil passions and a restoration of man to his
original state of purity.

<span id="fn_1028"></span>[355:2](m12b122.htm#fr_1028.md) This chief of the
Asura passions was *Mahamoha* or great Heedlessness. The word *Devas*
here is taken to mean the senses. Of course, if verse 16 be not taken
metaphorically, then may *Devas* be taken in its ordinary sense of the
deities.

<span id="fn_1029"></span>[355:3](m12b122.htm#fr_1029.md) The genius of the
two languages being different, it is very difficult to render the
phraseology of the first line. Literally rendered, the line would read
'they remain or stay on those acts, and establish them.' Besides being
unidiomatic, the sentence would be unmeaning. 'To stay or remain on any
act' is to adhere to it. 'To establish it' is to regard it as a
precedent and cause it to be regarded by others as a precedent.

<span id="fn_1030"></span>[355:4](m12b122.htm#fr_1030.md)
*Samsiddhadhigamam* is explained by the commentator thus: *Samsiddhah*
is *nityasiddah*, *i.e.*, *atman*; *tadadhigamam* is *atmajnanam*.

<span id="fn_1031"></span>[356:1](m12b122.htm#fr_1031.md) The very gods are
subject to prosperity and adversity, and their effects of loves and
hates. There is no mode of life in which these may not be found.
