### SECTION XVI

Vaisampayana said, "After the conclusion of Arjuna's speech, Bhimasena
of great wrath and energy, mustering all his patience, said these words
unto his eldest brother, 'Thou art, O monarch, conversant with all
duties. There is nothing unknown to thee. We always wish to imitate thy
conduct, but, alas, we cannot do it!--"*I will not say anything! I will
not say anything*--! Even this is what I had wished! Impelled, however,
by great grief I am constrained to say something. Listen to these words
of mine, O ruler of men! Through the stupefaction of thy faculties,
everything is endangered, and ourselves are being made cheerless and
weak. How is it that thou that art the ruler of the world, thou that art
conversant with all branches of knowledge, sufferest thy understanding
to be clouded, in consequence of cheerlessness, like a coward? The
righteous and unrighteous paths of the world are known to thee. There is
nothing belonging either to the future or the present that is also
unknown to thee, O puissant one! When such is the case, O monarch, I
will indicate, O ruler of men, the reasons in favour of your assuming
sovereignty. Listen to me with undivided attention. There are two kinds
of diseases, *viz*., physical and mental. Each springs from the other.
None of them can be seen existing independently. Without doubt, mental
diseases

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

spring from physical ones. Similarly physical diseases spring from
mental ones. This is the truth. He that indulgeth in regrets on account
of past physical or mental woes, reapeth woe from woe and suffereth
double woe. Cold, heat, and wind,--these three are the attributes of the
body. <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md) Their existence in harmony is
the sign of health. If one of the three prevails over the rest, remedies
have been laid down. Cold is checked by heat, and heat is checked by
cold. Goodness, passion, and darkness are the three attributes of the
mind. The existence of these three in harmony is the sign of (mental)
health. If one of these prevails over the rest, remedies have been
prescribed. Grief is checked by joy, and joy is checked by grief. One,
living in the present enjoyment of this, wishes to recollect his past
woes. Another, living in the present suffering of woe, wishes to
recollect his past bliss. Thou, however, wert never sad in grief or glad
in bliss. <span id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41.md) Thou, shouldst not,
therefore, use thy memory for becoming sad during times of bliss, or
glad during times of woe. It seems that Destiny is all-powerful. Or, if
it be thy nature, in consequence of which thou art thus afflicted, how
is it that it does not behove thee to recollect the sight thou sawest
before, *viz*., the scantily-clad Krishna dragged, while in her season,
before the assembly. <span id="fr_42"></span>[3](#fn_42.md) Why does it not
[behove](errata.htm#6) thee to recollect our expulsion from the (Kuru.md)
city and our exile (into the woods) dressed in deerskins, as also our
living in the great forests? Why hast thou forgotten the woes inflicted
by Jatasura, the battle with Chitrasena, and the distress suffered at
the hands of the Sindhu king? Why hast thou forgotten the kick received
by the princess Draupadi from Kichaka white we were living in
concealment? A fierce battle, O chastiser of foes, like that which thou
hast fought with Bhishma and Drona is now before thee, to be fought
(however) with thy mind alone. In deed, that battle is now before thee
in which there is no need of arrows, of friends, of relatives and
kinsmen, but which will have to be fought with thy mind alone. If thou
givest up thy life-breath before conquering in this battle, then,
assuming another body, thou shalt have to fight these very foes
again. <span id="fr_43"></span>[4](#fn_43.md) Therefore, fight that battle
this very day, O bull of Bharata's race, disregarding the concerns of
thy body, and aided by thy own acts, conquer and identify with thy
mind's foe. <span id="fr_44"></span>[5](#fn_44.md) If thou canst not win
that battle, what wilt be thy condition?

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

\[paragraph continues\] On the other hand, by winning it, O monarch,
thou shalt have attained the great end of life. Applying thy intellect
to this, and ascertaining the right and the wrong paths of creatures,
follow thou the course adopted by thy sire before thee and govern
properly thy kingdom. By good luck, O king, the sinful Duryodhana hath
been stain with all his followers. By good luck, thou too hast attained
to the condition of Draupadi's locks. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md) Perform with due rites and profuse
presents the horse-sacrifice. We, are thy servants, O son of Pritha, as
also Vasudeva of great energy!'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_40"></span>[29:1](m12a016.htm#fr_40.md) Otherwise named
phlegm, bile and wind.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[29:2](m12a016.htm#fr_41.md) The sense is that thou
wert ever superior to joy and grief and never sufferedst thyself, to be
elated with joy or depressed with grief.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[29:3](m12a016.htm#fr_42.md) The argument seems to
be this: if it is thy nature to call back thy woes even when happiness
is before thee, why dost thou not then recollect the insult to your
wife? The recollection of this insult will fill thee with wrath and
convince thee that in slaying thy foes,--those insulters of thy
wife--thou hast acted very properly.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[29:4](m12a016.htm#fr_43.md) The meaning is that in
consequence of thy abandonment of prosperity and kingdom and, therefore,
of the means of effecting thy salvation by sacrifice and gifts and other
act, of piety, thou shalt have to he re-born and to renew this mental
battle *with thy doubts*.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[29:5](m12a016.htm#fr_44.md) This is a difficult
verse, and I am not sure that I have understood it correctly.
*Gantavyam* is explained by Nilakantha as connected with
*paramavyaktarupasya*. According to Nilakantha, this means that thou
shouldst go to, *i.e.* conquer, and identify thyself with, the *param*
or foe of that which is of unmanifest form, the mind; of course, this
would mean that Yudhishthira should identify himself with his own soul,
for it is the soul which is his foe and <span id="page_30">p. 30</span>
with which he is battling. Such conquest and identification implies the
cessation of the battle and, hence, the attainment of tranquillity.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[30:1](m12a016.htm#fr_45.md) *The condition of
[Draupadi's](errata.htm#7.md) lock*,--*i.e.*, thou hast been restored to
the normal condition. Draupadi had kept her locks dishevelled since the
day they had been seized by Duhsasana. After the slaughter of the Kurus,
those locks were bound up as before, or restored to their normal
condition.
