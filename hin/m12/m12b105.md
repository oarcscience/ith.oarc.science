### SECTION CCLXXVIII

"Yudhishthira said, 'Of what behaviour must a man be, of what acts, of
what kind of knowledge, and to what must he be devoted, for attaining to
Brahma's place which transcends Prakriti and which is unchangeable?'

"Bhishma said, 'One that is devoted to the religion of Emancipation,
frugal in fare, and the master of one's senses, attains to that high
place which transcends Prakriti and is unchangeable. <span
id="fr_831"></span>[4](#fn_831.md) Retiring from one's home, regarding gain
and loss in the same light, restraining the senses, and disregarding all
objects of desire even when they are ready (for enjoyment), one should
adopt a life of Renunciation. <span id="fr_832"></span>[5](#fn_832.md)
Neither with eye, nor with word, nor in

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

thought, should one disparage another. Nor should one speak evil of any
person either in or out of his hearing. One should abstain from injuring
any creature, and conduct oneself observing the course of the Sun. <span
id="fr_833"></span>[1](#fn_833.md) Having come into this life, one should
not behave with unfriendliness towards any creature. One should
disregard opprobrious speeches, and never in arrogance deem oneself as
superior to another. When sought to be angered by another, one should
still utter agreeable speeches. Even when calumniated, one should not
calumniate in return. One should not behave in a friendly or an
unfriendly way in the midst of human beings. One should not go about
visiting many houses in one's round of mendicancy. Nor should one go to
any house having received a previous invitation (to dinner). <span
id="fr_834"></span>[2](#fn_834.md) Even when bespattered with filth (by
others), one should, resting firmly in the observance of one's duties,
refrain from addressing such bespatterers in disagreeable speeches. One
should be compassionate. One should abstain from returning an injury.
One should be fearless; one should refrain from self-laudation. The man
of restrained senses should seek his dole of charity in a householder's
abode when the smoke has ceased to rise from it, when the sound of the
husking rod is hushed, when the hearth-fire is extinguished, when all
the inmates have finished their meals, or when the hour is over for
setting the dishes. <span id="fr_835"></span>[3](#fn_835.md) He should
content himself with only as much as is barely necessary for keeping
body and soul together. Even that much of food which produces
gratification should not be coveted by him. When he fails to obtain what
he wants, he should not suffer himself to cherish discontent. Success,
again, in obtaining what he wants, should not make him glad. <span
id="fr_836"></span>[4](#fn_836.md) He should never wish for such things as
are coveted by ordinary men. He should never eat at anybody's

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

house when respectfully invited thereto. One like him should reprobate
such gains as are obtained with honour. <span
id="fr_837"></span>[1](#fn_837.md) He should never find fault (on account
of staleness, etc.) with the food placed before him, nor should he
applaud its merits. He should covet a bed and a seat that are removed
from the haunts of men. The places he should seek are such as a deserted
house, the foot of a tree, a forest, or a cave. Without allowing his
practices to be known by others, or concealing their real nature by
appearing to adopt others (that are hateful or repulsive), he should
enter his own Self. <span id="fr_838"></span>[2](#fn_838.md) By association
with Yoga and dissociation from company, he should be perfectly equable,
steadily fixed, and uniform. He should not earn either merit or demerit
by means of acts. <span id="fr_839"></span>[3](#fn_839.md) He should be
always gratified, well-contented, of cheerful face and cheerful senses,
fearless, always engaged in mental recitation of sacred *mantras*,
silent, and wedded to a life of Renunciation. Beholding the repeated
formation and dissolution of his own body with the senses that result
from and resolve into the elemental essences, and seeing also the advent
and departure of (other) creatures, he should become free from desire
and learn to cast equal eyes upon all, subsisting upon both cooked and
uncooked food. Frugal in respect of his fare, and subjugating his
senses, he achieves tranquillity of Self by Self. <span
id="fr_840"></span>[4](#fn_840) One should control the (rising.md) impulses
of words, of the mind, of wrath, of envy, of hunger, and of lust.
Devoted to penances for cleansing his heart, he should never allow the
censures (of others) to afflict his heart. One should live, having
assumed a status of neutrality with respect to all creatures, and regard
praise and blame as equal. This, indeed, is the holiest and the highest
path of the Sannyasa mode of life. Possessed of high soul, the Sannyasin
should restrain his senses from all things and keep himself aloof from
all attachments. He should never repair to the places visited by him and
the men known to him while leading the prior modes of life. Agreeable to
all creatures, and without a fixed home, he should be devoted to the
contemplation of Self. He should never mingle with house-holders and
forest-recluses. He should eat such food as he may obtain without effort
(and without having thought of it beforehand). <span
id="fr_841"></span>[5](#fn_841.md) He should never suffer joy to possess

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

his heart. To those that are wise such a life of Renunciation is the
means for the attainment of Emancipation. To those, however, that are
fools the practice of these duties is exceedingly burthensome. The sage
Harita declared all this to be the path by which Emancipation is to be
achieved. He who sets forth from his home, having assured all creatures
of his perfect harmlessness, attains to many bright regions of felicity
which prove unending or eternal.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_831"></span>[289:4](m12b105.htm#fr_831.md) By *Prakriti*, as
explained in previous Sections, is meant primal nature consisting of the
five great essences of earth, water, etc.

<span id="fn_832"></span>[289:5](m12b105.htm#fr_832.md) *Samupodeshu* is
explained as *upasthiteshu api*, *i.e.*, even when such objects are
present and ready for enjoyment.

<span id="fn_833"></span>[290:1](m12b105.htm#fr_833.md) *Maitrayangatah*,
as explained by the commentator, is *Suryavat-pratyaha-vibhinna-margah*,
*i.e.*, roving like the Sun every day in a different path. The object of
the speaker is to lay it down that one solicitous of Emancipation should
never confine oneself to one spot, but rove or wander over the world
without owning a fixed habitation or home. K.P. Singha translates the
word wrongly.

<span id="fn_834"></span>[290:2](m12b105.htm#fr_834.md) In the first line,
the Bengal reading *madhya na chacharet* is better than *madhya cha
nacharet*. *Pradakshinam* is *ankulam*, and *savyam* is *pratikulam*.
The grammar of the second line is not difficult. Besides, the
commentator explains it clearly. The Burdwan translator, leaving out the
words *bhaikshacharyam* and taking *anapannah* as equivalent to
*vipadapannah*, gives a thoroughly ridiculous version. K.P. Singha,
also, is not correct. The commentator explains that *charyam* means
*anekagrihatanam*; *anapannam* is *akurvan*. The second foot is
unconnected with the first.

<span id="fn_835"></span>[290:3](m12b105.htm#fr_835.md) *Muni*, here, is
one who has restrained his senses, or who has betaken himself to the
path of Renunciation. *Patrasamchara*, I think, is the act of setting
the dishes for those who are to dine off them. The commentator explains
that it means 'the motion of those who are to distribute the food.' Of
course, their motions from the kitchen to the dining hall and back are
implied if the word is taken for 'setting of dishes.' The sense remains
unaltered. The *Muni* must be abstemious and hence he should select an
hour like this for begging his dole, when there would be very little in
the house to give.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[290:4](m12b105.htm#fr_836.md) *Matra* is a
technical word signifying the taking of food to the extent of only
gratification of hunger, or, as explained by Chakrapani Datta in his
commentary on *Charaka, triptimatram*. When *matra* is to be
disregarded, clothes, etc., need not be mentioned. *Vihanyeta* is
equivalent to *hinsito na syat*.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[291:1](m12b105.htm#fr_837.md) The second line is
passed over by K.P. Singha. What is meant by it is that when such a man
is respectfully presented with anything, he should hold it in
reprobation. *Vide* the Sanatsujatiya Sections in *Udyoga Parva*,
particularly the verses beginning with *Yatra akathayamanasya*, etc.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[291:2](m12b105.htm#fr_838.md) The second line is
skipped over by K.P. Singha. The Burdwan translator gives a wrong
version. The commentator explains that *anyam* refers to *paisachim*,
and *anyatra* to *atmani*. In the Sanatsujatiya Sections also, a
Brahmana's practices are directed to be concealed. 'To enter his own
Self' is to turn self on Self, *i.e.*, to withdraw oneself from
everything for understanding and contemplating the Soul.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[291:3](m12b105.htm#fr_839.md) By totally
abstaining from acts he should avoid both merit and demerit.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[291:4](m12b105.htm#fr_840.md) This is a triplet.
The Burdwan translator misses the meaning of the first half of the first
line. The commentator explains that *abhayastam* is continuous;
*bhautikam* is *tattwajatam*, *atmanodehendriyadi*. Hence, *bhutanam*
means *anyesham bhutanam*.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[291:5](m12b105.htm#fr_841.md) To think beforehand
of the food one is to take is to convert oneself into gourmand. The
Sannyasin, without thinking of the food he would take, and without
mentally indulging in a foretaste thereof should take what he gets
without exertion.
