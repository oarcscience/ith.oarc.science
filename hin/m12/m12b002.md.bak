### SECTION CLXXV

"Yudhishthira said, 'Time, which is destructive of every created thing,
is passing on. <span id="fr_12"></span>[3](#fn_12.md) Tell me, O grandsire,
what is that good thing which should be sought.'

"Bhishma said, 'In this connection, O king, is cited the old narrative
of a discourse between sire and son, O Yudhishthira! A certain Brahmana.
O Partha, who was devoted to the study of the Vedas, got a very
intelligent son who (for this) was called Medhavin. <span
id="fr_13"></span>[4](#fn_13.md) One day, the son, well conversant with the
truths of the religion of Emancipation, and acquainted also with the
affairs of the world, addressed his sire devoted to the study of the
Vedas.'

"The son said, 'What should a wise man do, O father, seeing that the
period of human life is passing away so very quickly? O father, tell me

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

the course of duties that one should perform, without omitting to
mention the fruits. Having listened to thee, I desire to observe those
duties.'

"The sire said, 'O son, observing the *Brahmacharya* mode of life, one
should first study the Vedas. He should then wish for children for
rescuing his ancestors. Setting up his fire next, he should seek to
perform the (prescribed) sacrifices according to due rites. At last, he
should enter the forest for devoting himself to contemplation.'

"The son said, 'When the world is thus surrounded on all sides and is
thus assailed, and when such irresistible things of fatal consequences
fall upon it, how can you say these words so calmly?'

"The sire said, How is the world assailed? What is that by which it is
surrounded? What, again, are those irresistible things of fatal
consequences that fall upon it? Why dost thou frighten me thus?'

"The son said, 'Death is that by which the world is assailed.
Decrepitude encompasses it. Those irresistible things that come and go
away are the nights (that are continually lessening the period of human
life). When I know that Death tarries for none (but approaches steadily
towards every creature), how can I pass my time without covering myself
with the garb of knowledge? <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) When
each succeeding night, passing away lessens the allotted period of one's
existence, the man of wisdom should regard the day to be fruitless.
(When death is approaching steadily) who is there that would, like a
fish in a shallow water, feel happy? Death comes to a man before his
desires have been gratified. Death snatches away a person when he is
engaged in plucking flowers and when his heart is otherwise set, like a
tigress bearing away a ram. Do thou, this very day, accomplish that
which is for thy good. Let not this Death come to thee. Death drags its
victims before their acts are accomplished. The acts of tomorrow should
be done today, those of the afternoon in the forenoon. Death does not
wait to see whether the acts of its victim have all been accomplished or
not. Who knows that Death will not come to him even today? In prime of
age one should betake oneself to the practice of virtue. Life is
transitory. If virtue be practised, fame here and felicity hereafter
will be the consequences. Overwhelmed by ignorance, one is ready to
exert oneself for sons and wives. Achieving virtuous or vicious acts,
one brings them up and aggrandises them. Like a tiger bearing away a
sleeping deer, Death snatches away the man addicted to the gratification
of desire and engaged in the enjoyment of sons and animals. Before he
has been able to pluck the flowers upon which he has set his heart,
before he has been gratified by the acquisition of the objects of his
desire, Death bears him away like a tiger bearing away its prey. Death
overpowers a man while the latter is stilt in the midst of the happiness
that accrues from the gratification of desire, and while, still
thinking, 'This has been done; this is to be done; this has been
half-done.' Death bears away the man, however designated according to
his

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

profession, attached to his field, his shop, or his home, before he has
obtained the fruit of his acts. Death bears away the weak, the strong,
the brave, the timid, the idiotic, and the learned, before any of these
obtains the fruits of his acts. When death, decrepitude, disease, and
sorrow arising from diverse causes, are all residing in thy body, how is
it that thou livest as if thou art perfectly hale? As soon as a creature
is born, Decrepitude and Death pursue him for (effecting) his
destruction. All existent things, mobile and immobile, are affected by
these two. The attachment which one feels for dwelling in villages and
towns (in the midst of fellowmen) is said to be the very mouth of Death.
The forest, on the other hand, is regarded as the fold within which the
senses may be penned. This is declared by the *Srutis*. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) The attachment a person feels for dwelling
in a village or town (in the midst of men) is like a cord that binds him
effectually. They that are good break that cord and attain to
emancipation, while they that are wicked do not succeed in breaking
them. He who never injures living creatures by thought, word, or deed,
is never injured by such agencies as are destructive of life and
property. <span id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md) Nothing can resist the
messengers (Disease and Decrepitude) of Death when they advance except
Truth which devours Untruth. In Truth is immortality. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[3](#fn_17.md) For these reasons one should practise the
vow of Truth; one should devote oneself to a union with Truth; one
should accept Truth for one's Veda; and restraining one's senses, one
should vanquish the Destroyer by Truth. Both Immortality and Death are
planted in the body. One comes to Death through ignorance and loss of
judgment; while Immortality is achieved through Truth. I shall,
therefore, abstain from injury and seek to achieve Truth, and
transgressing the sway of desire and wrath, regard pleasure and pain
with an equal eye, and attaining tranquillity, avoid Death like an
immortal. Upon the advent of that season when the sun will progress
towards the north, I shall restraining my senses, set to the performance
of the *Santi*-sacrifice, the *Brahma*-sacrifice, the Mind-sacrifice,
and the Work-sacrifice. <span id="fr_18"></span>[4](#fn_18.md) How can one
like me worship his Maker in animal-sacrifices involving cruelty, or
sacrifices of the body, such as *Pisachas* only can perform and such as
produce fruits that are transitory? <span id="fr_19"></span>[5](#fn_19.md)
That person whose words, thoughts,

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

penances, renunciation, and *yoga* meditation, all rest on *Brahma*,
succeeds in earning the highest good. There is no eye which is equal to
(the eye of) Knowledge. There is no penance like (that involved in)
Truth. There is no sorrow equal to (that involved in) attachment. There
is no happiness (that which is obtainable from) renunciation. I have
sprung from Brahma through *Brahma*. I shall devote myself to *Brahma*,
though I am childless. I shall return to *Brahma*. I do not require a
son for rescuing me. A Brahmana can have no wealth like to the state of
being alone, the state in consequence of which he is capable of
regarding everything with an equal eye, the practice of truthfulness,
good behaviour, patience, abstention from injury, simplicity, and
avoidance of all rites and visible sacrifices. What use hast thou, O
Brahmana, of wealth or kinsmen and relatives, of wives, when thou shalt
have to die? Seek thy Self which is concealed in a cave. Where are thy
grandsires and where thy sire?' <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md)

"Bhishma continued, 'Do thou also, O monarch, conduct thyself in that
way in which the sire (in this story), conducts himself, devoted to the
religion of Truth, after having listened to the speech of his son.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_12"></span>[5:3](m12b002.htm#fr_12.md) *i.e.*, coursing on,
without waiting for any one.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[5:4](m12b002.htm#fr_13.md) Literally, intelligent.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[6:1](m12b002.htm#fr_14.md) The true reading is
*Jnanena* and not *ajnanena*. Then, in the last foot, the word is
*a-pihitah* and not *apihitah*. The words with *ava* and *api*
frequently drop the initial *a*, Hence *a-pihitah* means *not* covered.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[7:1](m12b002.htm#fr_15.md) The word used in the
text is *Devanam* (of the gods). There can be no doubt however, that the
word *deva* is here used for implying the senses.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[7:2](m12b002.htm#fr_16.md) *i.e.*, wild beasts and
lawless men.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[7:3](m12b002.htm#fr_17.md) *Asatyajyam* and
*Asatyadyam* are both correct. The sense is the same. The first means
'having untruth for the libation (that it eats up).' The second means
'having untruth for the food (it devours)'.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[7:4](m12b002.htm#fr_18.md) *Santi* is
tranquillity. The *Santi*-sacrifice is the endeavour to practise
self-denial in everything; in other words, to restrain all sorts of
propensities or inclinations. The *Brahma*-sacrifice is reflection on
truths laid down in the *Upanishads*. The Word-sacrifice consists in the
silent recitation (*japa*) of the *Pranava* or Om, the initial mantra.
The Mind-sacrifice is contemplation of the Supreme Soul. The
Work-sacrifice consists in baths, cleanliness, and waiting upon the
preceptor.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[7:5](m12b002.htm#fr_19.md) Both readings are
correct, *viz*., *Kshetrayajna* and *Kshetrayajna*. *Kshetra* is, of
course, the body. If the latter reading be accepted, the meaning will be
'a sacrifice like that of a *Kshatriya*, *i.e.*, battle.' Hence, all
kinds of acts involving cruelty.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[8:1](m12b002.htm#fr_20.md) or, seek *Brahma* in
thy understanding. The word *Atman* is often synonymous with Supreme
Self.
