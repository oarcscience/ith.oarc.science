### SECTION CLX

"Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, O thou of virtuous soul, what, indeed,
is

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

said to be productive of great merit <span
id="fr_458"></span>[1](#fn_457.md) for a person attentively engaged in the
study of the Vedas and desirous of acquiring virtue? That which is
regarded in this world as productive of high merit is of diverse kinds
as set forth in the scriptures. Tell me, O grandsire, about that which
is regarded as such both here and hereafter. The path of duty is long
and has innumerable branches, O Bharata! Amongst those duties what are
those few that should, according to thee, be preferred to all others for
observance? Tell me, O king, in detail, about that which is so
comprehensive and which is so many-branched.'

"Bhishma said, 'I shall speak to thee of that by which thou mayst attain
to high merit. Possessed as thou art of wisdom, thou shalt be gratified
with the knowledge. I will impart to thee, like a person gratified with
having quaffed nectar. The rules of duty that have been uttered by the
great *Rishis*, each relying upon his own wisdom, are many. The highest
among them all is self-restraint. Those amongst the ancients that were
acquainted with truth said that self-restraint leads to the highest
merit. As regards the Brahmana in particular, self-restraint is his
eternal duty. It is from self-restraint that he obtains the due fruition
of his acts. Self-restraint, in his case, surpasses (in merit) charity
and sacrifice and study of the Vedas. Self-restraint enhances (his)
energy. Self-restraint is highly sacred. Through self-restraint a man
becomes cleansed of all his sins and endued with energy, and as a
consequence, attains to the highest blessedness. We have not heard that
there is any other duty in all the worlds that can equal self-restraint.
Self-restraint, according to all virtuous persons, is the highest of
virtues in this world. Through self-restraint, O foremost of men, a
person acquires the highest happiness both here and hereafter. Endued
with self-restraint, one acquires great virtue. The self-restrained man
sleeps in felicity and awakes in felicity, and moves through the world
in felicity. His mind is always cheerful. The man who is without
self-restraint always suffers misery. Such a man brings upon himself
many calamities all born of his own faults. It has been said that in all
the four modes of life self-restraint is the best of vows. I shall now
tell thee those indications whose sum total is called self-restraint.
Forgiveness, patience, abstention from injury, impartiality, truth,
sincerity, conquest of the senses, cleverness, mildness, modesty,
steadiness, liberality, freedom from wrath, contentment, sweetness of
speech, benevolence, freedom from malice,--the union of all these is
self-restraint. It also consists, O son of Kuru, of veneration for the
preceptor and universal compassion. The self-restrained man avoids both
adulation and slander. Depravity, infamy, false speech, lust,
covetousness, pride, arrogance, self-glorification, fear, envy and
disrespect, ale all avoided by the self-restrained man. He never incurs
obloquy. He is free from envy. He is never gratified with small
acquisitions (in the form of earthly happiness of

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

any kind.) He is even like the ocean which can never be filled. <span
id="fr_459"></span>[1](#fn_458.md) The man of self-restraint is never bound
by the attachments that arise from earthly connections like to those
involved in sentiments like these, '*I am thine, Thou art thine, They
are in me, and I am in them*.' Such a man, who adopts the practices of
either cities or the woods, and who never indulges in slander or
adulation, attains to emancipation. Practising universal friendliness,
and possessed of virtuous behaviour, of cheerful soul and endued with
knowledge of soul, and liberated from the diverse attachments of the
earth, great is the reward that such a person obtains in the world to
me. Of excellent conduct and observant of duties, of cheerful soul and
possessed of learning and knowledge of self, such a man wins esteem
while here and attains to a high end hereafter. All acts that are
regarded as good on earth, all those acts that are practised by the
righteous, constitute the path of the ascetic possessed of knowledge. A
person that is good never deviates from that path. Retiring from the
world and betaking himself to a life in the woods, that learned person
having a complete control over the senses who treads in that path, in
quiet expectation of his decease, is sure to attain to the state of
*Brahma*. He who has no fear of any creature and of whom no creature is
afraid, has, after the dissolution of his body, no fear to
encounter. <span id="fr_460"></span>[2](#fn_459.md) He who exhausts his
merits (by actual enjoyment) without seeking to store them up, who casts
an equal eye upon all creatures and practises a course of universal
friendliness, attains to *Brahma*. As the track of birds along the sky
or of fowl over the surface of water cannot be discerned, even so the
track of such a person (on earth) does not attract notice. For him, O
king, who abandoning home adopts the religion of emancipation, many
bright worlds wait to be enjoyed for eternity. If, abandoning all acts,
[abandoning](errata.htm#58.md) penances in due course, abandoning the
diverse branches of study, in fact, abandoning all things (upon which
worldly men set their hearts), one becomes pure in his desires,
liberated from all restraints, <span id="fr_461"></span>[3](#fn_460.md) of
cheerful soul, conversant with self, and of pure heart, one then wins
esteem in this world and at last attains to heaven. That eternal region
of the Grandsire which springs from Vedic penances, and which is
concealed in a cave, can be won by only self-restraint. <span
id="fr_462"></span>[4](#fn_461.md) He who takes pleasure in true knowledge,
who has become enlightened, and who never injures any creature, has no
fear of coming back to this world, far less, any fear in respect of the
others. <span id="fr_463"></span>[5](#fn_462.md) There is

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

only one fault in self-control. No second fault is noticeable in it. A
person who has self-control is regarded by men as weak and imbecile. O
thou of great wisdom, this attribute has only one fault. Its merits are
many. By forgiveness (which is only another form of self-control), the
man of self-control may easily acquire innumerable worlds. What need has
a man of self-control for a forest? Similarly, O Bharata, of what use is
the forest to him that has no self-control? That is a forest where the
man of self-control dwells, and that is even a sacred asylum.'

"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Bhishma, Yudhishthira
became highly gratified as if he had quaffed nectar. Again the king
asked that foremost of virtuous men. That perpetuator of Kuru's race
(questioned by his grandson) once more began to discourse cheerfully (on
the topic raised).'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_457"></span>[349:1](m12a159.htm#fr_458.md) The word *Sreyas*
has a peculiar meaning. It implies, literally, the best of all things;
hence, ordinary, in such passages, it means [beatitude](errata.htm#57.md)
or the highest happiness that one may acquire in heaven. It means also
those acts of virtue by which that happiness may be acquired. It should
never be understood as applicable to anything connected with earthly
happiness, unless, of course, the context would imply it.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[350:1](m12a159.htm#fr_459.md) The sense is that
such a man never sets his heart upon things of this world, and
accordingly these, when acquired, can never satisfy him. His aspirations
are so great and so high above anything this world can give him that the
attainment of even the region of Brahma cannot, as the commentator
explains, gratify him. At first sight this may look like want of
contentment, but in reality, it is not so. The grandeur of his
aspirations is sought to be enforced. Contentment applies only to
ordinary acquisitions, including even blessedness in heaven.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[350:2](m12a159.htm#fr_460.md) *i.e.*, such a man
is sure of attaining to a blessed end.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[350:3](m12a159.htm#fr_461.md) Such as
distinctions of caste, of dress, of food, etc., etc.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[350:4](m12a159.htm#fr_462.md) A reference to the
region of *Brahma*, which is supposed to be located within every heart.
One reaches that region through penances and self-denial. The sense, of
course, is that his is that pure felicity of the heart who has succeeded
in driving off all evil passions therefrom.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[350:5](m12a159.htm#fr_463.md) The word used here
is *Buddhasya* (genitive of Buddha.) May not this verse be a reference
to the Buddhistic idea of a Buddha?
