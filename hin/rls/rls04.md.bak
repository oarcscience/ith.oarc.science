### The Four Stages of Life.

The life of a Brahman was, according to the Laws of Manu, divided into
four periods or Â*s*ramas, that of a pupil or Brâhma*k*ârin, that of a
householder or G*ri*hastha, of an ascetic or Vânaprastha, and of a
hermit or Yati. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) The first and second
stages are clear enough; they represent the scholastic and the married
stages of a man's life, the former regulated by the strictest rules as
to obedience, chastity, and study, the second devoted to all the duties
of a married man, including the duty of performing sacrifices, both
public and private. The names of ascetic and hermit for the third and
fourth stages are of course approximate renderings only; not having the
thing, we have not got the name. But the chief difference between the
two seems to be that in the third stage the Brahman still keeps to his
dwelling in the forest outside his village, and may even be accompanied
there by his wife, see his children, and keep up his sacred

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

fires, performing all the time certain exercises, as enjoined in their
sacred books, while in the last stage a man is released from all
restrictions, and has to live alone and without any fixed abode <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md). Some translators have used hermit for the
third, and ascetic for the fourth stage. In Sanskrit also there exists a
variety of names for these two stages, but the distinctive character of
each is clear, the third stage representing a mere retreat from the
world, the fourth a complete surrender of all worldly interests, a
cessation of all duties, a sundering of all the fetters of passion and
desire, and a life without a fixed abode. The modern Mahâtmans should
therefore be considered as belonging partly to the third, partly to the
fourth or last stage. They are what we should call friars or itinerant
mendicants, for it is their acknowledged privilege to beg and to live on
charity.

Another name of these Sa*m*nyâsins was Avadhûta, literally one who has
shaken off all attachments, while in the language of the common people
they are often called simply Sâdhus, or good men.

It has sometimes been denied that there are any Sa*m*nyâsins left in
India, and in one sense this is true. The whole scheme of life, with its
four stages, as traced in the Laws of Manu, seems to have been at all
times more or less of an ideal scheme, a plan of life such as, according
to the aspirations of the Brahmans, it ought to be, but as, taking human
nature as it is, it could hardly ever have been all over India. Anyhow,
at present, though

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

there are men in India who call themselves Sa*m*nyâsins, and are called
Sâdhus by the people, they are no longer what Manu meant them to be.
They no longer pass through the severe discipline of their studentship,
they need no longer have fulfilled all the public and private duties of
a married householder, nor have remained for a number of years in the
seclusion of their forest dwelling. They seem free at any time of their
life to throw off all restraints, if need be, their very clothing, and
begin to preach and teach whenever and wherever they can find people
willing to listen to them.

That the rules laid down in Manu's Law-book had often been broken in
early times, we learn from the existence of a whole class of people
called Vrâtyas. As far back as the Brâhma*n*a period we read of these
Vrâtyas, outcasts who had not practised brahma*k*arya, proper
studentship <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md), but who, if they would
only perform certain sacrifices, might be readmitted to all the
privileges of the three upper castes. That these Vrâtyas were originally
non-Aryan people is a mere assertion that has often been repeated, but
never been proved. The name was technically applied, during the
Brâhma*n*a period, to Aryan people who had belonged to a certain caste,
but who had forfeited their caste-privileges by their own neglect of the
duties pertaining to the first stage, brahma*k*arya. There were actually
three classes of them, according as the forfeiture affected them
personally or dated from their parents or grandparents. All the three
classes could be readmitted

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

after performing certain sacrifices. In the modern language vrâtya has
come to mean no more than naughty or unmanageable.

It is curious to observe how the Buddhist revolt was mainly based on the
argument that if emancipation or spiritual freedom, as enjoyed in the
third, and more particularly in the fourth stage, was the highest goal
of our life on earth, it was a mistake to wait for it till the very end
of life. The Buddhists were in one sense Vrâtyas who declined to pass
through the long and tedious discipline of a pupil, who considered the
performance of the duties of a householder, including marriage and
endless sacrifices, not only as unprofitable, but as mischievous. Buddha
himself had declared against the penances prescribed for the Brâhmanic
ascetic as a hindrance rather than as a help to those who wished for
perfect freedom, freedom from all passions and desires, and from the
many prejudices of Brâhmanic society. It seems almost as if the early
Buddhists, by adopting the name of Bhikshu, mendicant, for the members
of their order (Sa*m*gha), had wished to show that they were all
Sa*m*nyâsins, carrying out the old Brâhmanic principles to their natural
conclusion, though they had renounced at the same time the Vedas, the
Laws of tradition, and all Brâhmanic sacrifices as mere vanity and
vexation of spirit.
