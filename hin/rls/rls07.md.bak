### Râmak*ri*sh*n*a.

Such a man was Râmak*ri*sh*n*a, who has lately obtained considerable
celebrity both in India and America, where his disciples have been
actively engaged in preaching his gospel and winning converts to his
doctrines, even among Christian audiences. This may seem very strange,
nay, almost incredible to us. But we have only to remember what the
religion of large numbers of people consists in who call themselves
Christians, without even having had an idea of what Christ really taught
or what He was meant for in the history of mankind. There are many who
know absolutely nothing either of the history or of the doctrines of
Christianity, or if they do, they have simply learnt their catechism by
heart. They repeat what they have learnt, but without an atom of real
faith or love. Yet every human heart has its religious yearnings, it has
a hunger for religion which sooner or later wants to be satisfied. Now
the religion taught by the disciples of Râmak*ri*sh*n*a comes to these
hungry souls without any outward authority. So far from being forced on

them, it is to them at first a heathen and despised religion. If they
listen to it at all, it is of their own free will; and if they believe
in any part of it, it is of their own free choice. A chosen religion is
always stronger than an inherited religion, and hence we find that
converts from one religion to another are generally so zealous for their
new faith, while those who never knew what real religion meant are
enthusiastic in proclaiming any truths which they seem to have
discovered for themselves and to which their heart has yielded a free
assent. Hence, though there may be some exaggeration in the number of
those who are stated to have become converted to the religion of
Râmak*ri*sh*n*a, and though some who now call themselves converts to the
Vedânta may in reality have made but the first step towards real
Christianity, there can be no doubt that a religion which can achieve
such successes in our time, while it calls itself with perfect truth the
oldest religion and philosophy of the world, viz. the Vedânta, the end
or highest object of the Veda, deserves our careful attention <span

Râmak*ri*sh*n*a himself never claimed to be the founder of a new
religion. He simply preached the old religion of India, which was
founded on the Veda, more particularly on the Upanishads, and was
systematised later on in the Sûtras of Bâdarâya*n*a, and finally
developed in the commentaries

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

of Sa*m*kara and others. Even in preaching that religion, and in living
the life of a recluse, as he did, Râmak*ri*sh*n*a by no means claimed to
stand alone. There were several leading Vedânta preachers in India
during the last fifty years, sometimes called Paramaha*m*sas. Keshub
Chunder Sen, well known in England and America, who was a great reformer
with a strong leaning towards Christianity, was not counted as one of
them, because he never passed through the proper discipline and did not
live the life of a Sa*m*nyâsin. But he mentions four among his
contemporaries who deserved that title: first, Dayânanda Sarasvatî, for
a time unfortunately connected with Madame Blavatsky; secondly, Pawâri
Bâba of Ghazipur; thirdly, the Sikh Nagaji of Doomraon; and lastly, our
Râmak*ri*sh*n*a, commonly called the Paramaha*m*sa of Dakshi*n*esvar.
'These,' he adds, 'are the four ascetic saints whom our friends have
from time to time duly honoured, and in whose company they have sought
the sanctifying influences of character and example. May we respect,' he
continues, 'and serve with profound respect and humility, every ascetic
saint whom Providence may bring to us. The impure become pure in the
company of Sâdhus.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_4"></span>[11:1](rls07.htm#fr_4.md) This is the explanation
given of the name of Vedânta. But it is probably an after-thought. Like
other compounds in anta, such as Siddhânta, Sûtrânta, &c., it was
probably meant at first for no more than the subject-matter of the Veda;
then, as it stands at the end of Brâhma*n*as and Âra*n*yakas, it was
explained as end of the Veda, and lastly as the end, i.e. the goal, the
highest object of the Veda.
