### Mozoomdar's Judgement.

Fortunately in our case we have the testimony not only of Vivekânanda,
who, as a devoted disciple of Râmak*ri*sh*n*a, might be suspected of
partiality, but we have several independent witnesses, some favourable,
others unfavourable. Mozoomdar must be counted as a favourable witness.
He stands aloof from the propaganda carried on by Râmak*ri*sh*n*a's
disciples, but he speaks of him in the highest terms. In a letter which
he addressed to me in September, 1895, he wrote: 'Both in Keshub's Life

of that saintly man and our obligations to him. But there was another
side of his character, which of course one could not take up, because it
was not edifying.' Here we see another ingredient of the Dialogic
Process.
