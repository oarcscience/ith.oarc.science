### Râmak*ri*sh*n*a's Language.

His speech at times was abominably filthy. For all that, he was, as you
say, a real Mahâtman, and I would not withdraw a single word I wrote in
his praise. Râmak*ri*sh*n*a was not in the least a Vedântist, except
that every Hindu unconsciously imbibes from the atmosphere around some
amount of Vedântism, which is the philosophical backbone of every
national cult. He did not know a word of Sanskrit, and it is doubtful
whether he knew enough Bengâli. His spiritual wisdom was the result of
genius and practical observation.'

There is a ring of truth and impartiality about this, and there is no
sign of jealousy, which often breaks out, even in India, among religious
reformers and their followers. As to his filthy language, we must be
prepared for much plain speaking among Oriental races. In a country
where certain classes of men are allowed to walk about in public places
stark naked, language too is not likely to veil what with us requires to
be veiled. There is, however, a great difference between what is filthy
and what is meant to he filthy. I doubt whether the charge of
intentional filthiness or obscenity, which has been brought against
writers like Zola, could be brought, or has ever been brought, against

\[paragraph continues\] Râmak*ri*sh*n*a. It is quite true that Hindus
who belong socially to the higher classes, though not necessarily
Brahmans by birth, would be more careful in their expressions. We seldom
find any blemishes of that kind in the writings of Rammohun Roy, Keshub
Chunder Sen, and their friends. But a certain directness of speech which
would be most offensive in England is evidently not regarded in that
light in India, and every scholar knows that many of their classical
poems, nay, even their Sacred Writings, contain passages which simply do
not admit of translation into English. In the three centuries (*s*ataka)
of Bhart*ri*hari, treating of worldly wisdom, love, and passionlessness,
the second, that of love, has generally been left out in English
translations. But the spirit of that S*rim*gâra-Sataka is by no means
the same as that of Zola's novels. On the contrary, the object of the
poet is to warn people against voluptuousness, not as something in
itself criminal, which has never been an Indian view, but as a hindrance
in obtaining that serenity of mind without which the highest objects of
life, dispassionateness, serenity, and clear-sightedness can never be
obtained. A most useful edition of all the three *S*atakas has lately
been published by Purohit Gopi Nath, M.A., Bombay, 1896.

It should not be forgotten that in Homer, in Shakespeare, nay, even in
the Bible, there are passages against which our modern taste revolts,
yet we object to Bowdlerised editions, because the indecencies are never
of an intentional character, and would seem to have been so, if they
were now removed by us.
