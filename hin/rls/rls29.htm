<P><A NAME="fn_16"></A><A HREF="rls29.htm#fr_16">189:1</A> This Index was made for a collection of the Sayings of Ramakrishna which was sent to me in manuscript. When the MS. came to be printed there were several sayings which had been given twice. As these had to be left out when they occurred the second time, it was necessary to assign two numbers to some of the sayings in order not to disturb the figures of the Index.</P><p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  </BODY>
