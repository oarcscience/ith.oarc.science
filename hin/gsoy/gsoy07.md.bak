# THE HATHA AND LAYA YOGAS

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

### CHAPTER FIVE

#### THE HATHA AND LAYA YOGAS

THE practice of *hatha-yoga* is composed chiefly of *prānāyāma*, which
is regulation of breath, *āsanā*, the practice of various postures, and
a set of six *bandhas* or body-purifications. Although the writer of
these words holds to the opinion that these physical practices cannot
develop the mind at all, or contribute to its yogic or occult
experience, he agrees that when the *hatha-yoga* exercises are properly
done they are very beneficial to the body. As long as people have bodies
they should treat them if possible as prize animals, but if that is too
much to ask they should at least give them good exercise as well as good
rest and good food. In this sense only one should understand the
well-known maxim: "No *rāja* without *hatha*; no *hatha* without
*rāja*."

The *āsanās* or postures have some advantages over

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

ordinary physical exercises intended for muscular development. Although
these latter do also stimulate good breathing and benefit the nervous
system to some extent, especially if used in conjunction with proper
relaxation at suitable times, the *hatha-yoga* postures do in addition
provide suppleness and slenderness, and give massage to the internal
organs. Besides this, when allied to suitable and not excessive
breathing exercises, the entire body benefits. None of the yoga schools
aims at abnormal strength—a reasonable standard such as is suitable for
the ordinary purposes of life is regarded as sufficient, and more than
that may often be just a matter of personal satisfaction or pride, not
the spiritual attainment which the *hatha-yogīs*, *rāja-yogīs* and all
other yogīs are aiming at, which contains no self-satisfaction.
Incidentally, one must remark, great mental muscularity—to use a
metaphor—is also not sought by any of them. If there are mental giants
among them, this must be put down to some work of supererogation in that
line in their previous lives.

In an earlier chapter we have spoken of *hatha* as the "sun" and "moon"
breaths. It comes in, say some works, with the sound of ha and goes out
with the sound of tha. Another explanation is that the "sun" and "moon"
correspond to the breaths travelling through the right and left
nostrils. Still a third view is that as the whole word *hatha*
ordinarily means

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

forcefulness, the system of *hatha-yoga* is one which, at least as
compared with other yogas, requires considerable energy. It has already
been stated that in those yogas the thinkings and meditations are
intended to be done without allowing any tension in the body.

We may introduce the picture of a typical form of *hatha-yoga* breathing
by quoting from the *Shiva Sanhitā*:

"The wise man, having closed the right nostril with the thumb of the
right hand, and having drawn air in through the left nostril, should
hold his breath as long as he can, and then let it out through the right
nostril slowly and gently. Next, having breathed in through the right
nostril, he should retain the air as long as possible, and then breathe
it out gently and very slowly through the left nostril.

"Let him thus practice regularly, with twenty retentions, at sunrise,
midday, sunset and midnight, every day, keeping a peaceful mind, and in
three months the channels of the body will have become purified. This is
the first of four stages of *prānāyāma* (regulation of breath), and the
signs of it are that the body becomes healthy and likeable and emits a
pleasant odor, and there will be good appetite and digestion,
cheerfulness, a good figure, courage, enthusiasm and strength.

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

"There are, however, certain things which the *swarasādhaka*
(breath-practiser) must avoid: foods which are acid, astringent,
pungent, salty, mustardy and bitter, and those fried in oil, and various
activities of body and mind, bathing before sunrise, stealing,
harmfulness, enmity, egotism, cunning, fasting, untruth, cruelty to
animals, sexual attachments, fire, much conversation and much eating. On
the contrary, he should use and enjoy *ghī* (butter clarified by
simmering), milk, sweet food, betel without lime, camphor, a good
meditation-chamber with only a small entrance, contentment, willingness
to learn, the doing of household duties with *vairāgya*, singing of the
names of Vishnu, hearing sweet music, firmness, patience, effort,
purity, modesty, confidence and helping the teacher. If there is hunger,
a little milk and butter may be taken before practice, but there should
be no practice for some time after meals. It is better to eat a small
amount of food frequently (with at least three hours’ intervals) than
much at once. If the body perspires it should be well rubbed (with the
hands). When the practice has become well established, these rules need
not be so strictly observed." <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)

One does not wish to put any of these *hatha-yoga* practices into print,
to be read by various kinds of people, without sounding a warning. Many
people

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

have brought upon themselves incurable illness and even madness by
practising them without providing the proper conditions of body and
mind. The old yoga books are full of such warnings, and they tell the
would-be practicer to go to a teacher who really knows all about these
things, to receive personal inspection and instruction. For example, the
*Gheranda Sanhitā* announces that if one begins the practices in hot,
cold or rainy weather, disease will be contracted, and also if there is
not moderation in diet, for only one half the stomach must ever be
filled with solid food. <span id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_51.md) When the
present writer tried, as a boy of fourteen or fifteen, the long
alternate breathing for three quarters of an hour, he found when he
stood up that he had lost his sense of touch and weight. He handled
things without feeling them, and walked without any sense of touching
the ground. The sense returned only after ten or fifteen minutes.

The *Hatha Yoga Pradīpikā* states that control of breath must be brought
about very gradually, "as lions, elephants and tigers are tamed," or
else "the experimenter will be killed," and by any mistake there arises
cough, asthma, head, eye and ear pains, and many other diseases. <span
id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_52.md) The *Shāndilya Upanishad* gives the same
warning. On the other hand, right

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

practice may be undertaken by anybody, even the young and the old, the
sick and the weak, and will result in slenderness and rightness of
body. <span id="fr_53"></span>[4](#fn_53.md)

The theory behind these breathing exercises is that between the mind and
the body comes *prāna*. This word is translated "principle of
life"—referring to life in the body. Five vital airs are mentioned
extensively in the Sanskrit literature which touches on the physiology
of the human body. *Prāna* is always referred to as the chief of these
vital airs. The word comes from a verbal root "an" meaning "to breathe,"
and thus "to live." Patanjali in his aphorism on *Prānāyāma* calls it
regulation of the manner of movement of *shwāsa* and *prashwāsa*, that
is, breathing. <span id="fr_54"></span>[5](#fn_54.md) The late Dr. Vaman R.
Kokatnur, noted scientist and Sanskrit scholar, in a paper read at the
American Chemical Society's meeting in Detroit in September 1927, quoted
a text which says that what is inhaled is *prāna* and what is exhaled is
*apāna*. On various grounds he made out a good case for these being
oxygen and carbon dioxide, a third "air," *udāna*, being hydrogen. Of
the other two of the five, *samāna* is generally spoken of as essential
to digestion and *vyāna* "pervades the whole body." Many speak of

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

these five airs as being something else, fine or "etheric," but all
agree that various ways of breathing affect them all. Many of the
teachers recommend the traditional proportions of one unit of time for
inbreathing (*pūraka*), four units for holding the breath within
(*Kumbhaka*), and two units for out-breathing (*rechaka*). The *Shiva
Sanhitā* speaks of the units being gradually lengthened, as seen in
verse iii 57: "When the yogī is able to practice holding the breath for
an hour and a half, various *siddhis* (faculties and powers) arise,
including prophecy, travelling at will, sight and hearing at a distance,
vision of the invisible worlds, entering others’ bodies, turning various
metals into gold, invisibility at will, and moving in the air."

Various teachers and books offer more elaborate, as well as some
simpler, breathing exercises. The following eight are often mentioned:
(1) Practice *kumbhaka* (holding the breath) until the pressure of air
is felt from head to foot, then breathe out through the right nostril;
(2) breathe in deeply and noisily, hold as before, and exhale through
the left nostril; (3) putting the tongue between the lips breathe in
with a hissing sound; exhale through both nostrils; (4) breathe out as
fully as possible, then in with a hissing sound, and go on very rapidly
like bellows, until tired; then exhale by the right, or (5) the left

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

nostril; (6) breathe in with the sound of a female bee; (7) after
breathing in, contract the throat, place the chin on the chest; breathe
out very slowly; (8) simply hold the breath, without inbreathing or
out-breathing, as long as you like.

While issuing warnings about these exercises, I would like to add that
many have found benefit from the following simple practice. Breathe in
fairly fully while saying mentally to yourself "*pūraka*;" hold the
breath in without any muscular effort while saying "*kumbhaka*,
*kumbhaka*, *kumbhaka*, *kumbhaka*;" breathe out quite fully while
saying "*rechaka*, *rechaka*." This may be done at odd times as a
pick-me-up, with generally about ten repetitions. The best slowness or
quickness of the words should be found by the student for himself, but
all the words should be of the same length. A tendency to lengthen them
a little may gradually and rightly appear.

Some teachers maintain that all the impurities of the body may be
removed merely by control of breath, but others hold that it is
necessary to practice also certain cleansings, especially in the case of
persons who are flabby and phlegmatic. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[6](#fn_55.md)

The six principal purifications are: (1) slowly (under the direction of
a teacher) learn to swallow a clean, slightly warm, thin cloth, four
fingers broad and fifteen spans long; hold on to the end of it, and

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

gradually draw it out again; (2) take an enema sitting in water and
using a small bamboo tube; shake well and dispel; (3) draw a fine
thread, twelve fingers long, in at one nostril and out at the mouth; (4)
look at something without winking, until tears come; (5) with the head
bent down, slowly massage the intestines, round and round both ways, and
(6) breathe rapidly, like the bellows of a blacksmith. <span
id="fr_56"></span>[7](#fn_56.md) These acts are said to remove corpulence
and many other diseases.

The *Gheranda Sanhitā* has a much bigger collection—about twenty-four
purifications—which includes swallowing air with the lips formed "like
the beak of a crow," and expelling it from below; doing the same with
water; gently pressing the intestines towards the spine one hundred
times, massaging the depression at the bridge of the nose (especially
after waking and after meals); vomiting by tickling the throat;
gargling; drawing air softly in at one nostril, and sending it out
softly at the other, alternately; drinking water in at the nostrils and
letting it out at the mouth. <span id="fr_57"></span>[8](#fn_57.md)

Closely connected with the elaborate practices of *prānāyāma* are the
postures (*āsanās*). Quite often eighty-four of these are enumerated,
but the *Shiva*

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Sanhitā* contents
itself with recommending four, which are called "The Adept Seat," "The
Lotus Seat," "The Powerful Seat," and "The Swastika Seat." These are
briefly as follows: (1) body straight, legs crossed, one heel at the
anus, the other at the front, gaze between the eyebrows, chin on
breast; <span id="fr_58"></span>[9](#fn_58) (2.md) legs folded with feet,
soles upwards, on opposite thighs, arms crossed, hands on thighs, tongue
pressed against teeth, chin on breast or held up, gaze on tip of nose
(or straight in front); or arms may be crossed behind, hands holding
great toes; <span id="fr_59"></span>[10](#fn_59) (3.md) legs stretched out,
apart, head held in hands and placed on knees; <span
id="fr_60"></span>[11](#fn_60) (4.md) feet between calves and thighs, body
straight. <span id="fr_61"></span>[12](#fn_61.md) The *Hatha Yoga
Pradīpikā* also advocates four *āsanās* especially, two being the same
and two different.

An excellent modern book on *prānāyāma*, *āsanās* etc., is *Yoga Asanās*
by Swāmī Shivānanda, of Rishikesh, in the Himālayas. <span
id="fr_62"></span>[13](#fn_62.md) In this the Swāmī explains with
illustrations a large number of postures, including the *Sukhāsana*, or
"pleasant posture" described and recommended for the West in my
*Practical*

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Yoga: Ancient and
Modern*. He also gives very useful simple breathing exercises as well as
the more elaborate ones.

We come now to another school of yoga called the laya yoga. Laya means
"latent" or "in suspense." The especial features of this yoga are its
study and practice of *kundalinī* and the *chakras*. *Kundalinī* is
described as a force lying in three and a half coils like a sleeping
serpent, in a cavity near the base of the spine. This is regarded as a
goddess or power, "luminous as lightning," who, even though sleeping,
maintains all living creatures. She lies there with her head blocking a
fine channel which goes straight up the spine and is known as the
*sushumnā*. Some, to link this up with modern thought, have called it
the fount of bodily electricity.

The purpose of the laya-yoga practice is to awaken the *kundalinī* (or
"coiled one"), who will start up hissing, and can then be carried
through the series of six *chakras* (literally, "wheels"), which are
threaded upon that channel at various points in the body, which are
situated at the level of the base of the spine, the root of the penis,
the navel, the heart, the throat and the eyebrows. These *chakras* are
depicted somewhat as flowers rather than wheels, and have petals
respectively numbering four, six, eight, twelve, sixteen, and two.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

The works describing these *chakras*, and the effects of meditation upon
them or in them, are altogether too numerous even to mention. <span
id="fr_63"></span>[14](#fn_63.md) They are depicted with very much
symbology. For example, the *anāhata chakra* (at the heart) has a
*yantra* or design showing twelve petals, each one bearing a certain
letter of the alphabet. In the center circle there is a pair of
interlaced triangles, having written in the middle of them the syllable
"*yam*" (which is a *mantra* or sound which can produce some effect when
properly repeated). This *yam* is pictured as riding on a black
antelope, and, in its final sound *m*, which is written as a dot, a
figure representing the male divinity is placed. He is styled Isha, has
three eyes, and holds out his hands with gestures of dispelling fear and
granting boons. Near by, in the pericarp of the lotus (for the *chakras*
are also called lotuses) is the female divinity Kākinī, seated on a red
lotus, having golden color, dressed in yellow clothes, wearing all kinds
of jewels and a garland of bones. She has four arms, two hands bearing a
noose and a skull, and the other two showing signs of dispelling fear
and granting boons. In the center, above the interlaced triangles, is an
inverted triangle as bright as lightning, and in that a

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

symbol of Shiva of a golden color with a crescent moon surmounted by a
dot upon its head. This *chakra*, like all the *padmas* (lotus flowers)
is brightly colored, the petals and pericarp being red.

One cannot attempt in this brief space to unravel the significance of
all these letters, colors and symbols, or to give the symbols of the
other five *padmas*. Each *chakra* has its own diagram, colors, animal,
divinities, letters, etc. It will be evident that the yogī, as he
meditates in each of them in the course of his progress, will have
plenty to think about. Arthur Avalon's excellent translation of the
*Shatchakra Nirūpana*, with comments thereon, is a mine of information
on the subject, but the thorough student should also read various minor
Upanishads, Purānas and general works on yoga touching on this subject.
There is a certain amount of conflicting testimony on the subject of
colors, divinities etc., but this does not mar the general unity of
information as regards all the main features. <span
id="fr_64"></span>[15](#fn_64.md)

There is in all the literature on the subject a poetical rather than an
exact description of what happens as *kundalinī* rises. The spine is
called "the axis of creation" for the body. In that is the channel
*sushumnā*;

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

within that another, named *vajroli* and within that again another,
called *chitrinī*, "as fine as a spider's thread." On this tube the
lotuses are said to be threaded "like knots on a bamboo rod." Kundalinī
rises up little by little, as the yogī employs his will. In one practice
he brings her as far as he can, and, as she pierces any one of the
lotuses, its face, which was turned downwards before, turns upwards, and
when the meditation is finished he leads her back to her home near the
base of the spine. <span id="fr_65"></span>[16](#fn_65.md)

It is further explained that as she leaves each *chakra* on the way up,
she withdraws the functions of that center, and so makes them latent,
hence the term laya-yoga, or the Yoga of Suspension. It is, of course,
natural that in such a process, as attention is given more and more to
the higher thought, the lower responses should become latent, as, for
example, when we are reading and do not hear or see a person who enters
the room.

Kundalinī proceeds upwards until she reaches the great
"thousand-petalled lotus" at the top of the head,

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

beyond all the six *chakras*. There she enjoys the bliss and power of
union with the source of all life, and afterwards, as she returns
through the centers she gives back to each its specific powers, purified
and enhanced. The process of bringing *kundalinī* to the highest point
is usually considered to require some years, but there are exceptional
cases in which it is done quickly.

The hatha-yoga books take up a curious view of the mind in relation to
all these matters. It is expressed in a few verses of the *Hatha-Yoga
Pradīpikā*. "The mind is the lord of the senses; the breath is the lord
of the mind; and that depends on *nāda*." <span
id="fr_66"></span>[17](#fn_66.md) "There is talk of *laya*, *laya*, but
what is its character? *Laya* is the non-arising of further
vāsanās, <span id="fr_67"></span>[18](#fn_67.md) and the forgetting of
external things." <span id="fr_68"></span>[19](#fn_68.md) Some of the minor
Upanishads, such as the *Muktika* of the *Shukla-Yajurveda*, have a
similar idea.

Even so brief an account of these practices as this is would be
incomplete without mention of the *mudrās*, or physical practices, and
the *nādas*, or internal sounds. The *mudrās*, although in some cases
similar to the purifications, are intended for a different

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

purpose—to obtain some delight or power, and to awaken *kundalinī*, for
it is held that the awakening can take place through *āsanās*
(postures), *kumbhakas* (holdings of the breath) and *mudrās*.

Though there are many *mudrās*, only ten are usually recommended. Among
the most popular ones intended to awaken *kundalinī* is that of
supporting the body on the palms of the hands and softly striking the
posteriors on the ground, which is also considered to remove wrinkles
and grey hair. In another, very highly recommended, the membrane under
the tongue is gradually cut ("one hair's breadth every seven days"), and
rubbed with salt and turmeric, so that the severed parts will not join.
The tongue is also gradually lengthened by a process resembling milking,
so that after six months the yogī can turn it upwards into the cavity at
the back of the palate, and thus, with the hole closed and the breath
suspended, contemplate *kundalinī* and "drink the nectar" flowing there.
Another physical method requires a sort of massage for an hour and a
half morning and evening, for up to forty-five days. Still another
requires the feet to be crossed behind the neck.

It must be mentioned that those rāja yogīs who do not approve of the
awakening of *kundalinī* by these external methods, nor even by
meditation upon it, nevertheless usually believe that *kundalinī*
naturally

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

awakens and rises as a result of the purely internal meditations which
they practice. This takes place a little at a time so that there is no
strong feeling or pain in the body, as is often the case when it is done
by the *hatha-yoga* methods. The purifying and subliming effects of the
return journey through the *chakra* in all cases awakens some degree of
clairvoyance and similar powers, but what the yogī sees will depend upon
his state of mind, and even then the understanding of what he sees will
depend upon his evolutionary status. There is plenty of room for error,
inasmuch as his own thoughts and those of others may easily be mistaken
for objective realities, as in dreams.

Some of the books prescribe an "elephant *mudrā*," which is performed by
standing up to the neck in water, drinking it in through the nostrils,
sending it out through the mouth and then reversing the process. This
resembles the action of elephants in the pools and rivers, though they
use the trunk only, not the mouth.

Now we come to the *nādas* or sounds. The *Shiva Sanhitā* instructs the
yogī to close the ears with the thumbs, the eyes with the index fingers,
the nostrils with the middle fingers and the lips with the remaining
four fingers. After some practice, he will begin to hear the mystic
sounds. The first will be like the

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

hum of a bee, then a flute and then a *vīnā*. With more practice there
comes the sound of bells, and afterwards thunder. The mind of the yogī
becomes absorbed in these sounds, and he forgets the external things
which could distract him. <span id="fr_69"></span>[20](#fn_69.md) These
sounds are usually called *anāhata*, or belonging to the heart center.
According to the *Hatha Yoga Pradīpikā*, when the ears, eyes, nose and
mouth are closed, a clear sound is heard—first like the tinkling of
ornaments, and later like kettle-drums; later still there is the sound
of the flute and the *vīnā*. In the middle stage there may be the sound
of bells and horns. The yogī must give his attention to the subtler
sounds. The *Nādabindu Upanishad* also gives much the same order of
sounds as the *Hatha Yoga Pradīpikā*, mentioning in stage one the sound
of the sea, clouds, waterfalls and kettledrums, in the second stage that
of drums, bells and horns, and thirdly, that of tinkling bells, flutes,
*vīnās* and bees. The *Hansa Upanishad* gives the order more in
agreement with the *Shiva Sanhitā*. First come soft chattering sounds,
then that of the bell, conch, lute, cymbals, flute, drum, double drum,
and, lastly, thunder. The *nāda laya* or "absorption

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

through sound" is regarded as a great aid to concentration. <span
id="fr_70"></span>[21](#fn_70.md)

*Samādhi*, the highest practice of yoga, is conceived in a very material
manner in the *hatha-yoga* books. The idea is that the yogī in *samādhi*
is uninfluenced by anything external, because the senses have become
inactive, and he does not even know himself or others. Although the
*Gheranda Sanhitā* says that *samādhi* involves union of the individual
with the supreme Self (*Parātman*) so that "I am Brahma and no other;
Brahma am I, without any sorrows; I am of the nature of fundamental
existence, knowledge and bliss, always free and self -supporting," <span
id="fr_71"></span>[22](#fn_71.md) it also prescribes, for the attainment of
this, various *mudrās* or physical practices, such as that of turning
the tongue into the nasal cavity and stopping the breath, <span
id="fr_72"></span>[23](#fn_72.md) the theory being that all you need to do
is to cut off contact with this world, and the other state will be
there.

below it. Others say that even from the beginning she was at the level
of the navel. These are not altogether reasonable views, if, as is
usually believed, *kundalinī* has the work of purifying and transmuting
all the lower centers on her return journey from the higher.

"perfume" of past attachments or desires, which now produce pleasure and
pain; if one may use a crude simile, like the smell of onions long after
they have been eaten.

gives the order as like the sounds of the nightingale, silver cymbal,
shell, lute, trumpet, thunder, and much other very valuable information
on yoga.
