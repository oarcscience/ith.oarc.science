### CHAPTER ONE

#### THE TEN ORIENTAL YOGAS

THERE is great interest in the Western world at the present time on the
subject of Oriental Occultism, and very rightly so, for the time has
come for it to be blended in with the practical material civilization
which has been so wonderfully developed in the modern world. There will
be two benefits in this blending—more success in the outer world and
more peace in the inner life. The time has gone for any of us—East or
West—to think of Occultism as an escape from material reality and
responsibility into some vague inner condition in which one retreats
from all that material life stands for. Rather it is concerned in the
purpose voiced by Emerson when he wrote: "To make in matter home for
mind." To make of this world a place where consciousness can enjoy to
the full all the powers of its own mind and

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

at the same time discover that there is more to the mind than is
commonly known—that is practical Occultism.

To know how the mind works we cannot do better than turn to the ancient
writers on what is called yoga—looking at *all* the principal ancient
schools of yoga, not only one or two of them. Of these there are seven
well-known surviving schools in India today, and in addition to these
our survey of Oriental Occultism would be incomplete without allusion to
three others—the Persian Sufis, the Buddhist "Noble Way," and the
Chinese and Japanese Zen. This makes ten in all.

Many are the modern teachers of practical occultism or yoga, but all of
them can be classed as especially devoted to the methods of one or other
of these modes of practice.

Why have we at the outset associated the word yoga with occultism?
Because yoga is the practice of occult powers—or rather the discovery
and use of those powers residing unseen in the depths of the human mind.
The practice could begin with the formula, "We are only part alive," and
from that standpoint proceed to investigate the Introspectional
Psychology of the ancients, which they said united them—yoga means
union—with the latent possibilities and unseen actualities of and beyond
the mind. The

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Introspectional
Psychology, all the ancient teachers asserted, is justified by its
results; it works.

That it should have been developed in elder times, in very peaceful
times, in the Orient, was very natural. In those very settled days there
were whole classes of society who had leisure to give to these matters.
There were not only solitary and silent hermit-investigators, but also
teachers with small schools, and travelling lecturers, and occasional
conferences of teachers organized by the ancient rulers. But nowadays we
have a phase of material activity, most fully developed in America and
now invading the Orient itself, which leaves people with little energy
or time to carry on the studies in Introspectional Psychology in which
many people formerly immersed themselves—in which they were often at
fault when they made the delights of the mind a substitute for the
valuable experience of the whole estate of man. This modern activity is
such that very often people have nervous breakdowns of various kinds.
Many must be the material achievements left unfulfilled because of the
collapse of those who could originate them but could not bear the strain
of carrying them to their completion.

It is into this field of sorrow, lit up only occasionally by success,
that the Oriental occultism can be brought for the discovery and use of
the inner resources

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

of the mind, increasing the power and improving the machinery of
thought, emotion and the will. That peace and power are two aspects of
one principle is one of the chief discoveries of the Oriental
occultist—a discovery within the reach of all reasonable persons.

It is not to be thought, however, that the ancient teachers alluded to
are proposing some sort of magic as a substitute for our present method
of doing things through the mechanism of a healthy body. That the magic
exists is true, and there is a long list of "psychic powers" which
manifest themselves in various degrees quite naturally as the process of
yoga goes on, but the teachers mostly refer to these as not of great
value, and advise against making the mind a "playground" for them. In
India there are many who can exhibit varieties of hallucinatory or
hypnotic effects, and also telepathy, psychometry, clairvoyance,
clairaudience, levitation, astral travelling, transportation and apport,
and similar occult or magical arts. Indeed, some people with very little
education in other respects have been specially trained in one or more
of these faculties and powers, so that they are able to astonish the
tourist and earn a living by exhibiting these feats. But the real yogīs
are not interested in these. They are interested in mastering
environment and finding the ethical and spiritual forces and experiences

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

which are not only immature but positively infantile in most people.

It will be asked: "Why do not these more perfect men use both the higher
powers and the magics?" The answer is, "They do. They use these
constantly, but they do not display them, for they know that very many
persons would be tempted out of the regular course of their evolution by
the glamour of these faculties and powers. And many would use them as
only another additional means for exploiting their fellow men." As to
such matters as applying a healing influence for body and mind—these can
be as well used in silence as with any display. I remember that one very
respected Hindu occultist, when questioned on this point said that if
highly successful and convincing demonstrations of the occult powers
were given, most people would be overcome by modesty and would want to
lean upon the demonstrator, others would be frightened, others would
call it the work of the devil, and some who had not seen for themselves
would call it all a fraud—but on the other hand those who sincerely
practice the yoga will invariably have before long some convincing
experiences of their own, useful for their own private encouragement and
essential benefit.

In my book *The Occult Training of the Hindus*, published some years ago
in Madras, and recently

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

reprinted there, I presented a brief survey of this subject, resulting
from my long residence in India, during which I was chiefly interested
in studying these matters. In that book I have told of my acquaintance
and friendship with many of these exponents of yoga, and how I thus
learned that all over the country there are tens of thousands of people
who give part of their day to the pursuit of the methods of the ancient
occult teachers, although they are engaged in modern occupations. There
is in India, I would say, a vein of practicality in these matters which
most Western persons just do not understand.

In the present small volume, intended to bring these matters more to the
attention of the West, I am making use again of much of the material in
that book, without feeling it necessary to employ quotation marks. This
has been done considerably in Chapters 2 to 6. Chapters 7 to 9 are
entirely newly written.

Let us begin then with the statement that the seven well-known varieties
of yoga practice among the Hindus can be listed as follows:—

1\. The Rāja Yoga of Patanjali.

2\. The Karma and Buddhi Yoga of Shrī Krishna.

3\. The Gnyāna Yoga of Shrī Shankarāchārya.

4\. Hatha Yoga.

5\. Laya Yoga.

6\. Bhakti Yoga.

7\. Mantra Yoga.

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

These seven can be classified in two groups—the first three being called
varieties of *rāja-yoga* and the last four varieties of *hatha-yoga*.
The adjective *rāja* means "kingly" because the man becomes king or
master of his own faculties. The last four emphasize the importance of
material aids, by working largely on the outside or on the "terrestrial
man," which is composed of the body along with its bundle of habitual
emotions and memories and knowledge.

The *rāja-yogī* maintains that the inner powers of the mind can never be
enhanced by any external means, but only by their own exercise.

Here the law of growth from within is paramount. By the use of thought,
thought grows. This is true also of love and the will. There is no other
way in which these growths can be obtained. A realization of this fact
sets the novice on his own feet, and cures him at the outset of any
tendency to lean or depend upon others, even upon experts and teachers
he may admire.

Still, this exercise can be hindered or at least made very difficult by
any bad condition of the body in such matters as nervous disorders,
irregular breathing, bad balance, and undue tension. The *hatha-yogīs*
of the more intellectual kind accede to the proposition that all higher
growth is from within, but still say "No *rāja* without *hatha*" because
they find that

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

bodies generally require some preparation. The thorough-going
*rāja-yogīs* however, generally reply that there is *rāja* without
*hatha*, and in fact that *rāja-yoga* if properly done will itself put
the body in order, for the mind influences the body even if the body
cannot influence the mind. Still there is no harm, they often add, in
just a little *hatha-yoga* as well, provided that the aspirant does not
fall into a state of dependence on anything or any person, and does not
seek merely the comforts of the body, emotions and knowledge, or make
his purpose the increase of his power with a view to gain in these three
fields.

The term *hatha-yoga*, when used strictly, refers specifically only to
the fourth school on our list, for it is specially devoted to breathing
practices, dealing with the incoming and outgoing—or *ha* and *tha*
breaths. But the term is quite elastic and portions of the remaining
three groups of teachings are generally included, to supplement the
breathing exercises of the *hatha-yoga* schools. Inasmuch as all the
four schools operate by external means they are all classable as in the
general field of *hatha-yoga*, as they all work on the body and
environment.

One of the great gains of modern yoga is that the "hair shirt" has been
entirely given up. The new race is not afraid of the world. It does not
regard it as evil or of the devil. Modern man can trust himself

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

amidst all the lures. He can handle them and be their master. He knows
his own powers and can very well judge the results of his use of them.
He can envisage a metaphysical goal and also be aware of the
metaphysical in the physical as he goes along. He feels that whatever he
may gain by any exercise or experience in his will, his goodwill and his
intelligence is all to the good, quite apart from any so-called material
gain, and there is no objection to that in addition. If he is caught up
in any interests, enthusiasms or excitements—as he is—he knows not to go
too far, and that he will come out of them richer in character, even if
a bit scarred. He knows that time will heal all the wounds and ripen the
character. So in the field of yoga today he is not in fear of missing
anything, nor dependent upon a particular guide, but will choose his
exercises with all the natural confidence with which he can choose a
good cigar. He asks for information, not gifts, nor orders, and here the
Orient spreads it out before him for his choice. According to individual
temperament each will choose, and then travel in the way that suits him
best.
