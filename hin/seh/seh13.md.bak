### THE DURGA PUJA

"AND there was war in Heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the
Dragon; and the Dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not, neither
was their place found any more in Heaven." Archaic sentences here and
there in the world's scriptures tell us of the wars that were waged in
Heaven before the beginning of time, and of the heritage--dim,
prehistoric, supernatural in the natural--that was left from them to men
and gods.

What is it that makes this element of mythology so clear, what force has
raised it in this one case to the significance which it attains in the
*Chandi* portion of the *Markandeya Purana?* This is, above all others,
the *Purana* of Bengal. But here the central figure of the drama is no
archangel, mighty in power and beauty, but the Mother herself,
personification of the creative energy, focus and centre of the visible
Universe. Back and forth amidst the applause of Heaven does She pursue
the ever-changing demons, and at the moment of her triumph, when,
ten-armed, pedestaled on the

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

living lion and sword in hand, She subjugates her foe for ever, She is
portrayed as the image of Durga. Such is the story told by the
scripture--half-epic, half-liturgy--from which are taken the texts that
are recited over and over again from one end of Bengal to the other,
with worship and fasting, throughout the great nine days, from the new
moon of *Aswin*, until *Dussera* or tenth day. Here and there are
those--monks in their monasteries, perhaps, or Brahmins in their
homes--who recite the whole of the *Chandi* again and again. But for all
alike, whether they do this or not, there is but one object of
contemplation--the wars that were in Heaven; one hope, and one
alone--the conquest of the demons by the gods.

Everywhere in India the feast that corresponds to the *Durga Puja* is
military in character. Perhaps fundamentally in consequence of the fact
that, in the North at least, the rains are just over, the first seven
days are spent in the cleaning and display of weapons; and on the tenth
occurs the prostration and exhibition of skill in arms. Very curious is
it at Nagpur on this day to see the last scion of the Bhonslas set out
on the stately promenade that was, to his fathers, the beginning of a
freebooting expedition, and long long before that, a hunting party.

But domestically, in Bengal, it is a very different element in the
festival that determines the feeling

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

of the home with regard to it. The child to whose after life each flash
of a waterfall is to, carry its reminder, more or less vivid, of Durga
with crown and sword, does not in its childhood itself conceive of Her
as the cosmic energy, appearing from amidst the ten points of the
compass. For the Mother of the Universe shines forth in the life of
humanity as a woman, as family life, and as country. Here She is the
maiden, perfect in beauty, nun-like in holiness, whose past and future
are a glorified wifehood, on whose rapture of devotion the eye of the
Great God Himself has fallen, and who enters the Indian household,
goddess and queen notwithstanding, as, after all, the little wedded
daughter, returning for a ten-days' visit to her father's house.

True, as the lad draws nearer to manhood, he must realise that the
father of the guest is no less than Himalaya, and his daughter,
therefore, the spouse of God--according to the legend, Mother India
herself. But this only gives continuity and ductility to his idea of the
myth. First Durga, the ten-days visitant; secondly, India, as Uma
Haimavati; and lastly, Maha-Sakti, the Infinite Force; but always and
increasingly as his power of recognition grows, that ceaseless energy
which works without and around him towards the due subordination, by the
forces of life and nature, of all that is vicious and unjust and out of
place.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

With what tenderness and intimacy, then, does the Bengali child learn to
conceive of his country and of God! It is a tenderness and intimacy
which, beginning with the use of images, may become inherent in a
language and characteristic of old races. The Mohammedan boatman of
Eastern Bengal is not in his own person a worshipper of Durga, and yet
the words "With folded hands before the Mother" may carry as much to him
as to the Hindu heart. Beyond a doubt, however, it is its higher
theological meaning which lends to the *Durga Puja* its overwhelming
elements of civic pageantry and national comprehensiveness. Those who
have studied religions as factors in social and political development
must be conscious of the great variety of threads that are united in any
single religious practice. What was it that made the Semitic races
worshippers of God the Father, and India the land of the worship of the
Mother? Can these vast tangles of social and geographical conditions
ever be completely unravelled? And even so, does India stand alone in
her personification, or is it not more or less common to the whole of
Eastern Asia? Regarding this last point, it is perhaps the fact that
what exists elsewhere in fragments and survivals has been preserved and
developed in India as a coherent whole. And within India itself, customs
and doctrines bearing on this worship, in more

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

or less of mutual un-relation, in many provinces, are in Bengal gathered
together and woven into a single perfect piece. Who shall say how old
was the *Chandi* in this region when it was fitted into and accounted
for, by the *Markandeya Purana?* And where can we go, outside the
province, that some echo of the old-time Mother-worship does not fall
upon our ear?

Aman, the Mother, guards every village of the South. It was Bhowani, the
terrible Mother, who led the Mahrattas to victory. The Mother, again,
was worshipped by the Sikh, using his sword as her image. Kali was the
patron goddess of Chitore. To this day the great birthday is marked, in
the Punjab and throughout the North-West Provinces, by the *Ram-Lilla*,
or miracle play of the Ramayana. To this day, in Mysore and all over the
Dekkan, *Dussera Puja* is the chief festival of the year. To this day,
in every part of India, the nine-days fast is performed by some member
of every high-caste household. To this day, in Madras, in Behar, and
among families of military tradition everywhere, is Virashtamy, the
solemn eighth day, the occasion of the worship and the tribute of the
sword.

In Bengal, however, all these elements--social, military, and
theological--are combined and rationalised in the characteristic
conception of the Divine Mother as Durga-Kali-Jagadhattri:

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Durga, the divine
energy, making and destroying, defeated and again conquering, impersonal
and indifferent to personal desires; Kali, mother of darkness, wielder
of destruction, receiver of sacrifice, whose benediction is death; and,
finally, Jagadhattri, the tenderness of the heart of God, who shines in
good women, and from whom came forth the Madonnas of the world. It is in
Bengal, too, when the image of the Mother has left her children for a
space, when the nine days of worship and of charity are ended; it is in
Bengal that the great tenth day is kept as that of the reknitting of
human ties, and the *bijoya* greetings of the family reunion go out
throughout the length and breadth of the land. For are not all bonds of
kindred indeed sanctified and renewed year by year at the feet of the
Divine Visitant? Is not the whole of the country at one in the presence
of the Mother?

It is more than thirty years since Bankim Chandra Chatterji, the great
Bengali romancer, sang the vision of the ended *Durga Puja* as the hour
of the Motherland's need as he saw the image plunge beneath the waves.
That the poet spoke the innermost thought of his countrymen,
interpreting the yearly drama that belongs to each one in a national
sense, however distant he may be in the sectarian; that he voiced in his
poem what each household and each individual had known already

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

in the heart, is proved by the history that has gathered round his song.
Every year that goes by, the images of the Mother become more and more
deeply, each in its turn, entwined with the thought of India to the
Indian heart. Mother and Motherland--where ends the one and where begins
the other? Before which does a man stand with folded hands, when he bows
his head still lower, and says with a new awe: "My Salutation to the
Mother!"
