### AN OLD COLLEGIATE VILLAGE

WE were a small and very cheerful party that set out to visit the
village of Khardah. It was here that Nityananda--ordered by Chaitanya to
take up the life of the householder--had dwelt year after year,
organising and instructing the then rudimentary society of Vaishnavism.
One day, about A.D. 1520, two thousand and five hundred men and women,
"all Mussulmans," hearing of the great teacher of love and mercy, had
come to him there to receive discipleship, and been admitted by him into
Hinduism, as the order of *Nera-Neris*, or the Shaven-hes and the
Shaven-shes. The records called them Mussulmans because to the writers
they were not recognisable as Hindus, and it had been long ago forgotten
that there could be any other category outside orthodox society to which
they could belong. But they were in fact Buddhists, and that memorable
day in the life of Nityananda definitely marked the death of Buddhism in
Bengal.

Could a more fascinating question have been opened up? Within an hour or
two we were on

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

our way to examine what traces of such events were left in the place of
their occurrence. The Ganges was full, and our little boat could not
always keep us water-tight against the occasional downpour of rain that
varied the monotony which uniformly fine weather would have caused. Near
Baranagore began the long succession of temples and sacred spots that
marked that part of the Ganges side which was always sacrosanct. As far
as this, said someone, Chaitanya came, for is it not true that at
Baranagore a house that Chaitanya visited still stands? From this point
on we noticed every now. and then a finer than ordinary *bathing-ghât*,
distinguishing some old centre of importance; at Panihaty the evidences
of a Moghul fort; again, the temple of the White Shiva, where in seasons
of drought the peasants pray for rain, and so on. Still the question
haunted us: would there at Khardah be any lingering sense of what the
town had stood for in the past? Would the memory of Nityananda be alive
in any real sense? Above all, could there possibly be any surviving
tradition of the great event, of the incorporation of the *Nera-Neris*
into Hinduism?

It seemed a wonderful story, this of Chaitanya and Nityananda, in the
early sixteenth century. Surely there is no other country where the
waking of genius is so welcomed as in India!

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The love that was
to spread to all mankind began to sweep Chaitanya of Nuddea into its
whirlpools and torrents of ecstasy when he was eighteen only; and for
three years more the foster-brother of his childhood shared with him
every thought and enterprise. Then the inner call became imperious.
Chaitanya could no longer brook the ways of the world, and saying
farewell to all about him he wandered off, alone and free. But before he
went, with strange prevision for one so planless of the work to be done
for the world he was leaving, he begged Nityananda to enter the
householder's life; and this behest was loyally carried out, his adopted
brother living for the rest of his life here on the Ganges bank at
Khardah. "And so," pursued the scholar, bent on expounding his own view,
"it is really Nityananda to whom is due the formation of the Vaishnava
community, and the working out of its rules for the admission of the
lowly and the fallen into orthodox society. It was no fall from a higher
life that led to the parting from Chaitanya. It was stern obedience and
a sense of work to be done. This was that Nityananda who walked in the
city without anger, without restlessness, and without pride. As for
Chaitanya, he spent the next twenty-six years of his life, first in
wandering, then at Brindaban, and then in the temple at Puri. He lived
there for eighteen years, and

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

there is not a village in Orissa where he is not worshipped. We of
Bengal know him as a poor Brahmin. We have his pedigree, and can tell
you of his family. But they in Orissa know him as God!"

In a deep quiet we came gradually to a fine old *ghât* made of tile-like
bricks, with ornamental buildings at the top on each side. Near it stood
a curious form of temple, made for the Exposition of the Image at the
*Ras Mela*. And further in the town, though hidden from us here at the
river bank, we knew that we should find the famous temple of Shyam
Sundar, built by Nityananda himself.

It was the rainy season, most beautiful of all times for visiting the
Ganges bank. The brimful river and the fresh green foliage gave an air
of opulence and unusual beauty. But the great feature of the place one
found as soon as landed to be the fine old buildings of the Gossain
houses. Unplastered walls of brick displayed the exquisite work of the
bricklayers, whose construction was of a quality to need no ornament.
The houses in the quiet lanes of Khardah were like eighteenth-century
colleges in some university city of the West: such was their air of
perfect craftmanship and conscious dignity. We reminded ourselves,
looking thus at the abodes of Nityananda's spiritual descendants, how
probably the people living here

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

had long forgotten the traditions of their home. Undoubtedly they must
have shrunk by this time into the tightest shell of orthodoxy. One must
not be too disappointed if they should prove the very reverse of what
their ancestors would have had them. One could not expect that a great
idea should persist, in its vigour, for four hundred years together in
the same spot. Thinking thus, I came to the paved brick pathway that led
to the temple of Shyam Sundar. Fascinated by the beauty
[of](errata.htm#2.md) the paved way, I followed it and came to the
precincts of the temple itself. As much as I could see from the entrance
I saw, and after some moments was turning away, when an old Brahmin
entered. "Oh no!" he cried; "come to this place in the *Nat-Mandir*. You
can see better here." Considerably cheered by the warmth of the
invitation, I followed his suggestion, while he went about his business
in the temple. A few minutes later we found the place of the
*Nera-Neris*. Sure enough, there it is to this day, kept in gracious
memory by this very name, the lawn before the cottage-home of
Nityananda, where the *Nera-Neris* were reabsorbed into their
Mother-Church. The site of the house that once stood on the grass is now
covered with an open veranda-floor, and the room in which Birbhadra, the
son of Nityananda, was born is marked by a couple of *tulsi* plants.
Here one can imagine Nityananda standing, in his

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

doorway, when the whole twenty-five hundred camped before him to state
their cases and accept his ruling. Beggar-men and women from all the
countryside, they must have been only too conscious, many of them, that
they were fallen and unworthy, in this way or that, and totally unaware
of the great name they may once have borne. For many a generation, nay
many a century, they had been constantly recruited by the failures of
society, who shaved their heads and donned a copper-wire above the
elbow, and with this mark of humility and religion, wearing the
ochre-coloured cloth, sallied forth to beg their bread and impose on no
one. Their name had long been held as a term of contempt, for were they
not monks and nuns who wandered in pairs? Away with such mummery! said
Bengal in effect. The crumbs from the richer tables were carelessly
thrown to them, for the Indian people condemn none to starve, but their
want of order and decency had made them a byword amongst men. Their very
name was hurled carelessly at a new offender as a term of reproach. How
strange that behind the courting of such a fate there is human
suffering! The sinner continued to shave his head and adopt the garment
of the order, and to sally forth with begging bowl in hand, and yet was
keenly aware the while of the ignominy of his situation, would have
given much, perhaps even complete self-reformation,

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

to have met with a little respect from other human beings. Such was the
sorry crowd that had camped on the lawn in those days at Khardah. Nay,
as the villagers were presently telling us, even now there are
*Nera-Neris*, and until lately it was the custom to give them a *mela*
here once a year. Increasing poverty is making this impossible, and some
of the older men among the local Gossains spoke of the fact in a
brokenhearted fashion, as of an ancestral trust betrayed. But until a
year or two ago the custom was maintained, and even now they are hoping
to revive it. Nay, they were taking us presently to another temple--not
of Shyam Sundar--built at a later date for the express purposes of the
mela, and still used by the *Nera-Neris* as a *dharmsala*. This temple
has never been finished, and consequently was never consecrated, but it
is, curiously enough, built in the old-time fashion of Buddhist
monasteries, as we see them at Mahavallipore; and this is fitting, since
it has to afford sleeping quarters for so many who in name at least are
of the religious.

The spirit of Nityananda, then, had not died out of Khardah. Nay, one
can imagine the beggars--whose feet, in the European Middle Ages, some
king was wont to wash with his own hands before sitting himself at the
banqueting board--we can imagine these acquiring in the

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

royal household a semi-symbolic character, as if within the palace
beggars and kings were specially to be reverenced. And something of this
spirit, I imagine, I detected at Khardah. The fact that we were
strangers, and one of us a foreign woman, seemed to strike the good
burghers as the very reason why we should be given civic entertainment,
and presently we found ourselves once more on the way to the temple.
They have heard the story of our tastes and predilections with attention
and sympathy, and now they would show us something that would please us.
They had a copy of *Bhagbat*, written by Nityananda with his own hand.
Oh, that book! They held It before us and every word was a picture.
Written with the old pens, on the old paper, with the old unfading ink,
there was not a letter, not a space, not a word, that was not perfect.
The very heart of Nityananda--free, sweet, rejoicing in beauty--seemed
to be displayed before us. But what of the other relic? Of that one
would speak, if one could, in whispers only. When Chaitanya commanded
his brother to go back to the world, and take up there the life of
householder and citizen, Nityananda broke his *sannyasin's* staff. And
there is the head of it to this day in the temple at Khardah. They
brought it out and held it up for us to see--the staff that was held in
the hand of Nityananda, during those three wonderful years

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

when he wandered side by side with Chaitanya through the villages and
towns of Bengal, preaching love. We look in a dream at the simple broken
piece of wood--only the head of the broken staff. But if we could see
what you have seen, if we could touch what you have touched!

But Khardah does not retain merely the memory, or the relics, of its
great happenings. It represents a community entrusted with a mission.
For hundreds of years it has stood charged with the duty of teaching the
inclusiveness of Hinduism. And were there not three strangers here, who
on this account should be accorded the franchise of the place? Hence we
could not depart from the temple till we had eaten *prasad*. All must
gather together and eat it with us. Hurriedly it was sent for, and
quickly consecrated, but already the twilight was falling when we tasted
the communion, standing in the transept below the altar in the temple of
Shyam Sundar. All Khardah, gentle and simple, Brahmin and lay folk, ate
it with us; for all, it seems, come to make salutation at the evening
*arati*. To one there it came with a sense of being "eaten in haste,
with loins girt and staff in hand, for it was the Lord's Passover": and
as, with many expressions of courtesy and respect, we turned away from
the hurried feast, the bells rang out and the blaze of the light began
for evening worship.

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

And so we dropped down the river in the starlight, thinking much of the
making of history here in our close neighbourhood, and feeling all the
wonder of a place that had not forgotten its mission in four hundred
years.
