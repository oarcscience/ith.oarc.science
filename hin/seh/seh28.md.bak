### NOTE TO THE NORTHERN PILGRIMAGE

WHEN we consider the overwhelming import of the Himalayan range to the
people inhabiting the plains of Northern India, it is not surprising
that the Hindus should, from time immemorial, have looked upon the
snow-capped peaks as the Abode of the Gods and have deified the rivers
which take their rise among them. The slopes of the Himalayas and the
banks of the rivers along their upper courses were dotted in past ages
with hermitages, monasteries, and colleges, which were the spring-heads
of Indian civilisation and spirituality. A few of these still exist,
while the shrines that are visited by multitudes of pious pilgrims are
very numerous and of a sanctity unsurpassed. The most famous are Mount
Kailas, Lake Manasa Sarovara, Kedar Nath, Badri Narayan, Hrishikesh,
Hardwar, and Amarnath. The last-named (in Kashmir) was visited by Sister
Nivedita in company with the Swami Vivekananda, and is the subject of a
chapter in *The Web of Indian Life*. The pilgrimage here described is
that to the group of sacred places situated in the Kumaon division of
the United Provinces.

Hardwar is one of the seven holy places spoken of in the Puranas as
especially leading to *Moksha*, salvation. The town stands on the right
bank of the Ganges, close by the gorge through which the sacred river
debouches on to the plains. It is the scene, every twelfth year, of a
vast

assemblage of pilgrims, on the occasion of the *Kumbh Mela*.

Hrishikesh is distinguished among holy places by reason of the fact that
it has preserved intact its character as a hermitage and place of
learning. Hindu ascetics still live there in thatched huts, sleeping on
grass-mats, content with the barest necessities obtained by begging,
speaking little or not at all, making spiritual culture and the pursuit
of divine knowledge their sole concern.

Srinagar, a principal town of the Garhwal district, is of course to be
distinguished from the city of the same name in Kashmir. It stands on
the left bank of the Alaknanda, the head stream of the Ganges, and owes
its importance to its position on the pilgrim route. The old town was
washed away in 1894, by a flood caused through the bursting of the Gohnā
Lake.

Kedar Nath, immediately below the snow-peak of Mahāpanth, at an
elevation of 11,753 feet, marks the spot where Shiva, in his flight from
the Pandavas, assumed the form of a buffalo and dived into the earth,
leaving his hind-quarters on the surface. Four miles from the temple, on
the way to the Mahāpanth peak, is the precipice known as the Bhairab
Jhāmp, whence sometimes the devotee, in the ecstasy of attainment, would
fling himself down.

The shrine of Badri Narayan is below the peak of Badrinath (23,210
feet). It stands on a shoulder of the mountain, at an elevation of
10,400 feet, on the road from Srinagar to the Mana Pass. Tradition
points to Sankaracharya as the founder of the original temple.
