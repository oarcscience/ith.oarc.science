### THE SHIP OF FLOWERS

IT is empty now, the place on my desk where the little ship of flowers
has stood all day. But out on the chill edge of the Ganges, as darkness
comes on, the tiny bark lies drifting, hither and thither, scarcely
determined betwixt ebb and flow, as we with a few of the children
launched it an hour ago. It was early still when we went down to the
riverside, and as we turned away only one worshipper had arrived besides
ourselves--a solitary girl of eleven or twelve--to send her offering out
to the Great Unknown. We stayed awhile then and watched her, as she
carefully removed the sacramental food from the birch-bark vessel, set
in the stern the little light, and then floated it boldly out upon the
waters. And after that, what could we do but stay and watch and watch,
with breathless interest, as long as ever the star shone clear in the
fragile craft which, we knew, with the turn of the tide, would reach the
main current and be carried far out to sea? O! innumerable fleet of
little nameless boats, floating on ponds and rivers, in all the villages
of Bengal to-night,

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

each bearing its twinkling lamp into the all-enshrouding dark, how like
ye are to life, how like to death!

For this is the last day of the Bengal month of *Pous*. It is the
old-time day for pilgrimage to Ganga-Sagar--that island where the river
meets the sea, And more than this, it is the day of prayer for all
travellers, all wanderers from their homes, for all whose footsteps at
nightfall shall not lead to their own door. It was in a crowded street
this morning, as I passed the end of a small bazaar, that I noticed the
eager faces and hurrying feet of men and women, hastening to carry to
those at home the ships of flowers. They were rude enough, these little
ships, that I too bought, to load with spoil of loving thought. Roughly
pinned together they were, made of the shining white core of the
plantain-stalk, and masted and arched from stem to stern with splinters
of bamboo, run through the hearts of yellow marigolds. Here and there
the dealers had made feint to imitate more closely, with coloured paper
flags and string, the sails and cordage of the old country boats. But
for the most part they were mere suggestions, glistening vessel and
burning-hearted flowers.

Mere suggestions, truly--but of what! Can we not see the quiet women,
sitting absorbed before the symbol at their feet, loading it with
offerings

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --*bel*-leaves,
flowers, the consecrated fruits and grain, and praying with each fresh
gift for some beloved life, that through the coming year it might go
safe amidst whatever tide, that even now, if peril somewhere threaten
it, it may be led safe home? Have we not here to-day the perfect picture
of Humanity--Man battling on the distant frontier-line of toilsome life;
and Woman--for love's sake, not for God's--holding fast to prayer?

One thinks of the cry of the Jew, sonorous through the ages--the Jew,
who loved not the sea, but lifted his eyes to the hills, to find his
help, and lost himself, between "I" and "thee," in an inflood of
blessedness: "The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in,
from this time forth, and even for evermore." One thinks of the churches
of Brittany, and the small model of a ship, *barque de ma vie*, that
hangs before every altar and in every private oratory. And there comes
back the echo of the sailor's cry, amid surf and storm, *Sainte Anne!
Sainte Anne!* 

Here too, in Bengal, we have a maritime people, once great among the
world's seafarers, and here, on the last day of *Pous*, we celebrate the
opening of the annual commercial season, the old-time going forth of
merchant enterprise and exploration. It was a traffic cut off from that
of Phoenicia, and all the well-omened

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

peoples of the Middle Sea, but unmistakably great in the East. China and
Japan, Cambodia and Burma, have welcomed the coming of the Bengal
mariners to their ports, being glad to win honour and wealth thereby. Fa
Hian, Hiouen-Tsang, and I-Ching are but three names, out of countless
hosts to whom they belonged, who sought the shores of India, or left
them, in the name of the knowledge and impulse that she had power to
send to other and less favoured peoples. But why cast our memory so far
back? It is little more than a hundred years since Indian shipbuilding
was famous through the world. Even now the wooden shipping that still
plies between the small countries of north-western Europe is in great
part discarded craft of Indian building and of Indian teak. And how
should these eastern vessels have won renown if the merchants and
sailors of India had not been great to man and use?

All day long, from the altar-shelf above my desk, the marigolds, like an
arch of sanctuary-lamps, have shone down upon me, and stirred a maze, a
multitude, of dreams and memories in heart and brain. "The Lord
bless--the Lord bless--going out--coming in--even for evermore!" Do we
not stand, even as here, on the river shores of life, and watch the
going forth of beloved souls into the perils of the world's high seas,
yea, into the far space and mystery of death?

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Yet hold we by
that very light, so like a star, they carry at their prow, that how
distant soever be the journey set, they shall not pass beyond the reach
of this our love and prayer, nor break outside the encircling barriers
of the heart of God.
