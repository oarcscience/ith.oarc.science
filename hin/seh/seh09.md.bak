### THE SACRED YEAR

WHETHER or not it is true, as some have held, that all sacred years are
built out of the wreckage of more ancient civil years, it is certain
beyond any possibility of cavil or question that behind the Hindu sacred
year lies another, a weather-year, full of the most loving and delicate
observation of nature. Each great day as it comes round is marked by its
own particular glinting of sunlight on the leaves, its own rare bite of
the morning air, or its own dancing of the blood at noon. When, in the
early autumn, the tiny, jonquil-like flowers are found fallen at dawn
from the *shephalika* bushes, and the children pick them up blossom by
blossom for worship, men say with something of the gladsomeness of
childhood itself, "Mother is coming! Mother is coming!" for they remind
them of the festival of Durga, by this sign near at hand. In springtime,
when the *asoka* tree begins to adorn itself with its bunches of red
flowers, that are said never to bud till the tree has heard the
footsteps of a beautiful woman, and the long slender buds of

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

the leaf-almond begin to appear, the low castes are glad, for now is
coming *Holi*, the Easter of the primitive peoples. On the birthday of
Krishna, late in the summer, it *must* rain, in memory of the night so
long ago when the Lord of All was carried as a babe, by Vasudeva,
through wind and storm. The *Kali Puja*, with its myriads of tiny open
lamps, seems always to happen on the night of some marriage-flight
amongst the insects, and always the little winged creatures suffer death
by fire on these altars of the Mother.

But there is no nature-festival to be compared with that of *Ras*. All
through the growing moon of the beautiful month of *Kartik*, the women
have gone to the Ganges-side at evening, night after night, with flowers
and lamps to offer vows. Now has come the full moon. It is the first of
the cold weather. The winter flowers are beginning to bloom. The world
is full of relief from the lessening of the long heat. The very trees
seem to rejoice in the unwonted coolness, and this was the moment at
which Krishna went with the cowherds to the forest. Throughout the rains
the cattle have been kept in the villages, and now they are taken to the
distant pastures. Oh, the joy of the forests: the long moonlight nights,
the whispering trees, the enfolding dark, the presence of the Cowherd,
who is in truth the Lord Himself! In those temples

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

which have the necessary buildings the image of Krishna is taken at
evening out of its sanctuary, and conveyed in procession to a little
Chapel of the Exposition, there to be worshipped publicly until the
morning. Here for three days in the small hours of the night, when the
moon has scarcely yet begun to wane, come the women to sit and worship,
or to go round and round the altar in a circle, silently praying. And
choirs of priests chant the while. And the image-sellers drive a brisk
though almost silent trade, and the precincts of the temple are thronged
with life, imagining itself out in the forest amongst the cowherds,
playing with the Lord.

Every full moon has its own special morsel of lore. To-night, at some
hour or other, the sweet goddess Lakshmi will enter the room, and we
must on no account sleep lest we miss her visit. Again, it is unlucky
this month for the heads of the family to see the moon. Therefore they
must not look out of the window, and this is well, for to-night is the
orchard-robbing festival, when the boys of the village have right to
enter the garden and carry off ripe fruit. What wonderful coincidence
fixed it to fall when the harvest of the jack-trees is ready for
gathering?

The whole of Hinduism is one long sanctification of the common life, one
long heart and

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

relating of soul to the world about it; and the love of pilgrimage and
the quest of sacred shrines speak of that same desire to commune with
nature as the village feasts. The holiness of nature is the fundamental
thought of Hindu civilisation. The hardships of life in camp and forest
are called austerity; the sight of grass and trees is called worship.
And the soothing and peace that come of a glimpse of a great river is
held a step on the road to salvation and the freeing of the soul.

How did this passion for nature become fixed and ritualised, in the
series of the year's fasts and feasts? Here opens out a field of most
fruitful study. A fixed system of universal consent always presupposes
some central authority, which persisted long enough not only to
pronounce authentically on disputable matters, but also to radiate as
custom what had been thus determined. This central authority exists in
India as the empire whose seat for nearly a thousand years was
Pataliputra. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) By its rulings was
Hinduism, in so far as it is universal throughout the country, shaped
and determined, and in order to know exactly what this was in its daily
working, it would be necessary to study in.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

detail the worships of Madras and the South. For here we have, more or
less in its purity, the Hinduism which grew up, antithetically to
Buddhism, during the Buddhist period. It differs in many ways from that
of Bengal, since there the faith went through a much longer period of
elaboration. Pataliputra was succeeded by Gour, the Guptas by the Sens,
and in the year A.D. 728 Adisur Sen, Emperor of the five Gours, as was
his title, brought to his capital, and established there for the good of
his people in matters of faith and scholarship, the celebrated five
Brahmins of Kanauj. And they made the face of Bengal to shine--which is
a brief way of saying, probably, that this king established an
ecclesiastical college of reference at Gour, which went on impressing
its influence on the life of Bengal, long after the original five, and
their king, had been gathered to their fathers. Even after the Hindu
sovereigns had fallen altogether, and the Mohammedan rulers had taken
their place, this Brahminical influence went on living and working. It
was in fact the Bengali form of Papacy, and before we rebel against it
too much, before we asperse it too bitterly for the cerecloths of
orthodoxy which it bound upon the people, we ought to know what were the
problems that it had to solve. It gave continuity to the social
development of the community, in the face of the most appalling
revolutions.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It made the faith
a strong ground of taste and manners and gave it consciousness of its
strength. It made the village into a true civic unit, in spite of
complexity of caste and origins. It maintained the growth of literature
and the epic-making faculty. And above all--the supreme gift of
Hinduism--it went on deepening and widening the education of the people
by that form of mind-cultivation which is peculiar to India, the form
that she knows not as secular schooling but as devotional meditation,
the power to which she will one day owe her recovery, should it be given
to her to recover her footing at all, in the world of nations.

The power of the Brahmin was never broken in Bengal till modern
education brought new tests to try men by. Mohammedanism had never
touched it. The new religion of Chaitanya was not even defiant of it.
Automatically it had gone on working and growing. The world is always
ready to call any overthrowal of the old by the name of reformation,
because in anything long established there is always much that needs
overthrow. Pruning and weeding are a parable of necessary processes in
thought and society also. But how can we call this a reformation unless
we know what new ideals are to be substituted for the old? That
destruction has taken place is indisputable, but does destruction

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

alone constitute reformation? In any case, Bengal owes her own
solidarity, her unity in complexity, her Hinduistic culture and the
completeness of her national assimilation, more perhaps to Adisur and
the Brahminical college that he established than to any other single
fact of these many centuries.

If this theory be correct, if the wider Hinduistic formalism was the
work of the Guptas of Pataliputra, and the orthodoxy of Bengal more
especially that of the Sen kings of Gour, a wonderful amount of history
lies in the study of the differences between the two. We shall in that
case expect to find more ancient and less homogeneous fragments of the
faith lying outside of Bengal. We shall look, moreover, to study the
development of the popular faith in parallelism with Buddhism outside.
For here a long obscuring process has been superposed upon the other.
Those elements of Hinduism in which it has marked affinities with the
classical and pre-classical religions of Europe must, for the most part,
be sought outside, in distant provinces, and at the conservative centres
of the great pilgrimage shrines. But for the potentialities of Hinduism,
for its power to bind and unite, for its civilising and liberalising
effect, we cannot do better than go to Bengal. Here we may disentangle
gradually the long story of the influences

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

that have made it what it is. Did the first image-makers come from
China? And when? In what order were the main worships introduced? What
was the original place of the planetary deities, of snakes and of trees,
in the scheme of things? Who were Satya-Pir and Satya-Narayan? These
questions, and a thousand like them, have to be answered before we can
understand and assign time and source to all the elements that have gone
to the making of the *sanatan dharma* in Bengal. Yet wherever we
go--north, east, or west--we shall always find that India herself has
been the inspiration of Hinduism, and that the faith without the land is
a name without a person, a face without a soul.
