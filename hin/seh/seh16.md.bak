### THE MEDIÆVAL UNIVERSITY OF INDIA

OF all the creations of a people--their art, their science, their
customs, their building, and the like--the highest and most spiritual is
their language. In this is expressed the soul of nations. In it is left
the impress of their love and hope, their ideals of achievement and
their criticism of the world.

Next to their country, there is no other single factor which does so
much to determine the nature and destiny of a people as their own
speech. Races and faiths come and go, children are born, grow old, and
die. Each contributes as it can to the common tongue, but it remains
superior to them all. As its language holds the soul of the nation, so
in like fashion its literature holds the soul of the language. Each of
the national factors wins recognition and immortality from the whole by
its power to contribute ideas, characters, and forms of beauty to this,
the dream-world of the race.

As one studies an Indian vernacular, the vastness and distinctiveness of
the Indian dream-world

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

continually grows on one. First there are the philosophical ideas which
give its tone to the dream. Then there is the great gallery of ideal
characters of which every Indian child by his birth is made a freeman,
that gallery in which a man may wander all his life without one
excursion into formal history: the dramatic background, as it were, of
each generation of the national struggle. Then there are proverbs and
fables innumerable, village-legends, quaint stories and metaphors,
beggars' songs, ancestral hero-tales, cherished memories of saints and
leaders, and all the floating literature that makes so large a part of
the spiritual home of man without even incarnating itself in letters.

Gradually it dawns upon one that behind all this there is some central
source of thought and strength, a fountain of authority, a standard of
correctness that gives dignity and assurance. This academic authority
lies in Sanskrit. Each of the Indian vernaculars throughout its long
history has followed steadfastly in the wake of the classical tongue.
All its higher literature has consisted of translations, and even where
it has not been direct translation the *<u>motif</u>* always claimed a
Sanskrit source. In that language all the great culture of the nation
has been preserved. Through it anyone might come in contact with the
highest ideas of the race.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

But Sanskrit is in itself a learned tongue; to acquire it takes many
years of a man's life. The question arises: How has it been maintained
in its purity and power from age to age? Each treasure is guarded and
developed by its own social formation. What was the society, and what
the education, that kept this living? Here we come upon the schools of
the Brahmins. It is impossible to realise without some personal
experience the definiteness and coherence of the old Hindu culture. Even
to this day those who live near a family of ministering priests will
hear father and son chanting the sacred texts, hour after hour, day
after day, from morn onwards. To the Brahmin even his house is a school.
But still more formal and absorbing was the organisation of the *tols*
or schools of Sanskrit. With these India was netted from end to end, and
men would come from the most distant parts to sit at the feet of some
renowned teacher. The New Learning takes little note of university
centres whose names are entered in no register, whose students are
contented to work year after year for pure love of knowledge, without
examination and without degree; where there is so little
self-consciousness that no man ever thought of making a list of their
names. Yet if disinterested love of truth and inheritance of deep and
complex knowledge be the distinction of a university, the

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> New Learning with
its great colleges and their immense revenues may well bow its, head
before the seats of learning of the Indian past. Benares and Nasik,
Ujjain, Conjeeveram, and the ancient Taxila--to name only a few of the
larger and more important of these seats--what pictures they call up to
the mind's eye! Not all the provinces are famous for one thing. The
South has kept the memory of the Vedas; Ujjain has held the palm in
astronomy and mathematics, Benares in grammar, and Bengal in logic.

To any one of these, from the most distant parts of India, young
students will travel, on foot for the most part, and beg, penniless, to
be accepted by the chosen teacher. One in the days of Buddha desiring to
learn medicine went all the way from Rajgir to Taxila, where Peshawar
now stands. He was taken as a pupil by the great master of healing at
whose door he knocked, and years passed happily by while he worked on,
absorbed in the quest of knowledge. Then came the day when his master
set him the final test, or as we should say, called for his doctor's
thesis. He was to go out into the fields and bring in all the medicinal
plants he knew. He went, but after long search he came back in great
trouble of mind. He could not bring in all the healing herbs, he said,
for all plants were of some use in medicine. And he demonstrated before
his

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

master the value to the physician of each one separately. Long
afterwards, it is told, when he had returned as a great scholar to
Magadha, this youth was allowed to heal Lord Buddha himself when he lay
ill of a fever.

Such a glimpse of the ancient university remained as true in the days of
Chaitanya of Nuddea, in the fifteenth century, as it was in the time
from which it comes down to us. Nay, I have heard from an. older
generation how it was in their own boyhood, only the other day. It is a
marvellously intense and earnest life that is revealed to us in the
routine of the old *tols*. A household of some fifty or sixty students,
distributed over a number of mud cottages arranged round a central tank,
made up the college of a single teacher. They arrive at the age of
twenty, perhaps, having broken the first ground of the subject of
themselves, and would often remain unmarried till thirty-five. In at
least one *tol* that I have heard of, at Vikramapore in Bengal, there
were three students admitted from Maharashtra, for the fame of Bengal
logic went far and wide, and all India knew the names of its best
teachers. Here in such *tols* as this was lived out the great ideal of
*brahmacharya*--the celibate student dwelling as a son in his master's
house.
