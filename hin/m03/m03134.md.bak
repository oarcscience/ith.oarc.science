# SECTION CXXXIV

"Ashtavakra said, 'O king, O leader of fierce legions, in this assembly
of monarchs of unrivalled power who have met together, I am unable to
find out Vandin, chief of the controversialists. But I am searching for
him, even as one doth for a swan on a vast expanse of water. O Vandin,
thou regardest thyself as the foremost of controversialists. When though
wilt engage with me in staking, thou wilt not be able to flow like the
current of a river. I am like a full-flaming fire. Be silent before me,
O Vandin! Do not awaken a sleeping tiger. Know that thou shalt not
escape unstung, after trampling on the head of a venomous snake, licking
the corners of its mouth with its tongue, and who hath been hurt by thy
foot. That weak man who, in pride of strength, attempts to strike a blow
at a mountain, only gets his hands and nails hurt, but no wound is left
on the mountain itself. As the other mountains are inferior to the
Mainaka, and as calves are inferior

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

to the ox, so are all other kings of the earth inferior to the lord of
Mithila. And as Indra is the foremost of celestials, and as the Ganga is
the best of rivers, so thou alone art, O king, the greatest of monarchs.
O king, cause Vandin to be brought to my presence.'

"Lomasa said, 'Saying this, O Yudhishthira, wroth with Vandin,
Ashtavakra thus thundered in the assembly, and addressed him in these
words, 'Do thou answer my questions, and I shall answer thine.' Thereat
Vandin said, 'One only fire blazeth forth in various shapes; one only
sun illumineth this whole world; one only hero, Indra, the lord of
celestials, destroyeth enemies; and one only Yama is the sole lord of
the Pitris. <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) Ashtavakra said, 'The
two friends, Indra and Agni, ever move together; the two celestial sages
are Narada and Parvata; twins are the Aswinikumaras; two is the number
of the wheels of a car; and it is as a couple that husband and wife live
together, as ordained by the deity.' <span id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26.md)
Vandin said, 'Three kinds of born beings are produced by acts; the three
Vedas together perform the sacrifice, Vajapeya; at three different
times, the Adhwaryus commence sacrificial rites; three is the number of
words: and three also are the divine lights.' <span
id="fr_27"></span>[3](#fn_27.md) Ashtavakra said, 'Four are the Asramas of
the Brahmanas; the four orders perform sacrifices; four are the cardinal
points; four is the number of letters; and four also, as is ever known,
are the legs of a cow.' <span id="fr_28"></span>[4](#fn_28.md) Vandin said,
'Five is the number of fires; five are the feet of the metre called
*Punki*; five are the sacrifices; five locks, it is said in the Vedas,
are on the heads of the Apsaras; and five sacred rivers are known in the
world.' <span id="fr_29"></span>[5](#fn_29.md) Ashtavakra said. 'Six cows,

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

it is asserted by some, and paid as a gratuity on the occasion of
establishing the sacred fire; six are the seasons belonging to the wheel
of time; six is the number of the senses; six stars constitute the
constellation *Kirtika*; and six, it is found in all the Vedas, is the
number of the Sadyaska sacrifice.' <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md)
Vandin said, 'Seven is the number of the domesticated animals; seven are
the wild animals; seven metres are used in completing a sacrifice; seven
are the *Rishis*, seven forms of paying homage are extant (in the
world); and seven, it is known, are the strings of the *Vina*.' <span
id="fr_31"></span>[2](#fn_31.md) Ashtavakra said, 'Eight are the bags
containing a hundred fold; eight is the number of the legs of the
Sarabha, which preyeth upon lions; eight Vasus, as we hear, are amongst
the celestials; and eight are the angles of *yupa* (stake), in all
sacrificial rites.' <span id="fr_32"></span>[3](#fn_32.md) Vandin said,
'Nine is the number of the mantras used in kindling the fire in
sacrifices to the *Pitris*; nine are the appointed functions in the
processes of creation; nine letters compose the foot of the metre,
Vrihati; and nine also is ever the number of the figures (in
calculation).' <span id="fr_33"></span>[4](#fn_33.md) Ashtavakra said, 'Ten
is said to be the number of cardinal points, entering into the cognition
of men in this world; ten times hundred make up a thousand; ten is the
number of months, during which women bear; and ten are the teachers of
true knowledge, and ten, the haters thereof, and ten again are those
capable of learning it.' <span id="fr_34"></span>[5](#fn_34.md) Vandin
said, 'Eleven are the objects enjoyable by beings; eleven is the number
of the *yupas*; eleven are the changes of the natural state pertaining
to those having life; and eleven are the Rudras among the gods in
heaven.' <span id="fr_35"></span>[6](#fn_35.md) Ashtavakra said, Twelve
months compose the year; twelve letters go to the composition of a foot
of the metre called *Jagati*; twelve are the minor sacrifices; and
twelve, according to the learned, is the number of the Adityas.' <span
id="fr_36"></span>[7](#fn_36.md) Vandin

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

said, 'The thirteenth lunar day is considered the most auspicious;
thirteen islands exist on earth. <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md)

Lomasa said, 'Having proceeded thus far, Vandin stopped. Thereupon
Ashtavakra supplied the latter half of the *sloka*. Ashtavakra said,
'Thirteen sacrifices are presided over by Kesi; and thirteen are
devoured by *Atichhandas*, (the longer metres) of the Veda. <span
id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38.md) And seeing Ashtavakra speaking and the
Suta's son silent, and pensive, and with head downcast, the assembly
broke into a long uproar. And when the tumult thus arose in the splendid
sacrifice performed by king Janaka, the Brahmanas well pleased, and with
joined hands, approached Ashtavakra, and began to pay him homage.'

"Thereupon Ashtavakra said, 'Before this, this man, defeating the
Brahmanas in controversy, used to cast them into water. Let Vandin today
meet with the same fate. Seize him and drown him in water.' Vandin said.
'O Janaka, I am the son of king Varuna. Simultaneously with thy
sacrifice, there also hath commenced a sacrifice extending over twelve
years. It is for this that I have despatched the principal Brahmanas
thither. They have gone to witness Varuna's sacrifice. Lo! there they
are returning. I pay homage to the worshipful Ashtavakra, by whose grace
to-day I shall join him who hath begot me.'

"Ashtavakra said, 'Defeating the Brahmanas either by words or subtlety.
Vandin had cast them into the waters of the sea. (That Vedic truth which
he had suppressed by false arguments), have I to-day rescued by dint of
my intellect. Now let candid men judge. As Agni, who knoweth the
character of both the good and the bad, leaveth unscorched by his heat
the bodies of those whose designs are honest, and is thus partial to
them, so good men judge the assertions of boys, although lacking the
power of speech, and are favourably disposed towards them. O Janaka,
thou hearest my words as if thou hast been stupefied in consequence of
having eaten the fruit of the Sleshmataki tree. Or flattery hath robbed
thee of thy sense, and for this it is that although pierced by my words
as an elephant (by the hook), thou hearest them not.'

"Janaka said, 'Listening to thy words, I take them to be excellent and
superhuman. Thy form also standeth manifest as superhuman. As thou hast
to-day defeated Vandin in discussion, I place even him at thy disposal.'
Ashtavakra said, 'O king, Vandin remaining alive, will not serve any
purpose of mine. If his father be really Varuna, let him be drowned in
the sea.'

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

Vandin said, 'I am King Varuna's son. I have no fear (therefore) in
being drowned. Even at this moment. Ashtavakra shall see his long-lost
sire, Kahoda.'

"Lomasa said, 'Then rose before Janaka all the Brahmanas, after having
been duly worshipped by the magnanimous Varuna. Kahoda said, 'It is for
this, O Janaka, that men pray for sons, by performing meritorious acts.
That in which I had failed hath been achieved by my son. Weak persons
may have sons endued with strength; dunces may have intelligent sons;
and the illiterate may have sons possessed of learning.' Vandin said,
'It is with thy sharpened axe, O monarch, that even Yama severeth the
heads of foes. May prosperity attend thee! In this sacrifice of king
Janaka, the principal hymns relating to the *Uktha* rites are being
chanted, and the Soma juice also is being adequately quaffed. And the
gods themselves, in person, and with cheerful hearts, are accepting
their sacred shares.'

"Lomasa said, 'When in enhanced splendour, the Brahmanas had risen up,
Vandin, taking king Janaka's permission, entered into the waters of the
sea. And then Ashtavakra worshipped his father, and he himself also was
worshipped by the Brahmanas. And having thus defeated the Suta's
son. <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](m03135.htm#fn_39.md) Ashtavakra returned
to his own excellent hermitage, in company with his uncle. Then in the
presence of his mother, his father addressed him, saying, '(O son), thou
speedily enter into this river, Samanga.' And accordingly, he entered
(into the water). (And as he plunged beneath the water), all his
(crooked) limbs were immediately made straight. And from that day that
river came to be called Samanga and she became invested with the virtues
of purifying (sins). He that shall bathe in her, will be freed from his
sins. Therefore, O Yudhishthira, do thou with thy brothers and wife
descend to the river, and perform thy ablutions. O Kunti's son, O scion
of the Ajamidha race, living happily and cheerfully at this place
together with thy brothers and the Brahmanas, thou wilt perform with me
other acts of merit, being intent upon good deeds.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_25"></span>[277:1](m03134.htm#fr_25.md) Ashtavakra comes to
Janaka's sacrifice with the object of proving the unity of the Supreme
Being. Vandin avails himself of various system of Philosophy to combat
his opponent. He begins with the Buddhistic system. The form of the
dialogue is unique in literature being that of enigmas and the latent
meaning is in a queer way hid under the appearance of
[puerile](errata.htm#84.md) and heterogeneous combinations of things.

Vandin opens the controversy by saying that as the number of each of
these is one, so one only intellect is the lord, leader and guide of the
senses.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[277:2](m03134.htm#fr_26.md) There is a Vedic
revelation that two birds live together on a tree as friends--one of
these eats the fruits and the other looks at the former. From this it is
manifest that *two* are the lords, leaders, and guides of the senses.
That there is a second faculty besides the intellect is also proved by
the fact that in sleep when the intellect is inactive that faculty
continues in action, for if it were not so we could not remember having
slept, nor connect the state after awaking with that preceding sleep.
Accordingly by citing the number *two* Ashtavakra assets that besides
intellect there is another faculty--consciousness that these *two* are
jointly the lords, leaders and guides of the senses and that they act
together as Indra and Agni, etc.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[277:3](m03134.htm#fr_27.md) By citing the number
*three* Vandin means to say that as it is Acts that produce the *three*
kinds of born beings, etc., so Acts are supreme and that everything else
be it intellect alone, or intellect and [consciousness](errata.htm#85.md)
together is subservient to Acts.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[277:4](m03134.htm#fr_28.md) Ashtavakra here
advances the thesis that even if Acts be supreme still when the
*(fourth)* or Supreme Being becomes manifest to the soul, it stands in
no further needs to Acts.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[277:5](m03134.htm#fr_29.md) By bringing in the
*quinquennial* series, Vandin wishes to assert that the *five* senses
are competent to cognise [their](errata.htm#86.md) respective objects and
that besides these senses and their objects there is neither any other
sense to perceive nor any other object of perception. He also cites the
authority of the Veda according to which the *Apsaras* (or
consciousness) have *five* "locks" on their hands--i.e., *five* objects
of perception.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[278:1](m03134.htm#fr_30.md) Besides the five
senses Ashtavakra contends for an additional sense namely the Mind and
accordingly cites the number *six*.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[278:2](m03134.htm#fr_31.md) Vandin admits the
existence of the six senses but says that the soul experiences happiness
and misery through those as well as through the *intellect*.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[278:3](m03134.htm#fr_32.md) Ashtavakra advances an
eighth element, namely, the *knowledge of the* [*ego*](errata.htm#87.md).

<span id="fn_33"></span>[278:4](m03134.htm#fr_33.md) Each of the three
qualities (existence, foulness and ignorance) of *prakriti* (the passive
or material cause of the world) mixing with each of the three
corresponding qualities of *pradhana* (the active or spiritual cause of
the world) in various proportions produces the mundane order of things.
Thus is proved the [eternity](errata.htm#88.md) of *prakriti* or nature and
is also established the doctrine of duality.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[278:5](m03134.htm#fr_34.md) Prakriti does not
really create. It is the Supreme Being who through the medium of
illusion in contract with the *ten* organs (viz., the five locomotive
organs and the five organs of sense) makes manifest the system of
things. Prakriti therefore has no real existence--her existence is only
apparent in the real existence of the soul.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[278:6](m03134.htm#fr_35) Yupas (stakes.md) mean
here, *feelings*, etc, which keep men bound to the world. *Rudras* are
those who makes others cry.

Vandin means to say that the soul is not essential free from the fetters
of happiness and misery arising from the eleven objects of perception.
In this world all men are subject to happiness and misery. We also hear
that there are Rudras in heaven.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[278:7](m03134.htm#fr_36.md) The supreme soul
unaffected by happiness and misery really exists--but His existence is
not susceptible of being proved--nor can the ignorant ever perceive Him.
Men attain that condition through these *twelve*, viz., virtue, true,
self-restraint, penances, good-will, modesty, forgiveness, exemption
from envy, sacrifice, charity, concentration and control over the
senses.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[279:1](m03134.htm#fr_37.md) According to some,
endeavours to attain emancipation can be successful not in this world
but in the world of Brahma. Others say that to that end a special *yoga*
is necessary. By bringing forward the objects numbering *thirteen*.
Vandin advances the opinion that, virtue, etc., are not sufficient for
purposes of emancipation but that suitable time and place are also
essential.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[279:2](m03134.htm#fr_38.md) Ashtavakra concludes
by citing the same number *thirteen*. The soul which is essentially
unaffected, becomes subject to happiness and misery through, the
*thirteen*, *viz*., the ten organs of locomotion and sense, and
intellect mind and egoism. But Atichhanadas, i.e., those that have
surmounted ignorance, namely, the twelve, virtue, etc. destroy those
thirteen and that is emancipation.
