<p>"Pulastya said, 'One should next proceed, O king, to the adored Kurukshetra at sight of which all creatures are freed from their sins. He is freed from all sins who constantly sayeth, <i>'I will live in Kurukshetra.'</i> The very dust of Kurukshetra, conveyed by the wind, leadeth a sinful man to a blessed course (in after-life). They that dwell in Kurukshetra which lieth to the south of the Saraswati and the north of the Drishadwati, are said to dwell in heaven. O hero, one should reside there, O thou foremost of warriors, for a month. There, O lord of earth, the gods with Brahma at their head, the Rishis, the Siddhas, the Charanas, the Gandharvas, the Apsaras, the Yakshas and the Nagas, often repair, O Bharata, to the highly sacred Brahmakshetra. O foremost of warriors, the sins of one that desireth to repair to Kurukshetra even mentally are all destroyed, and he finally goeth into the region of Brahma. O son of the Kuru race, by repairing to Kurukshetra in a pious frame of mind, one obtaineth the fruit of the Rajasuya and horse sacrifices. By saluting next the Yaksha called Mankanaka, that mighty gate-keeper (of Kuvera), cue obtaineth the fruit of giving away a thousand kine. O virtuous king, one should next repair to the excellent region of Vishnu, where Hari is</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A></p>  
<p>always present. Bathing there and bowing down unto Hari, the Creator of the three worlds, one obtaineth the fruit of the horse-sacrifice and repaireth to the abode of Vishnu. One should next repair to Pariplava, that <i>tirtha</i> celebrated over the three worlds, and (bathing there), O Bharata, one obtaineth merit that is greater than that of the <i>Agnishtoma</i> and the <i>Atiratra</i> sacrifices. Repairing next to the <i>tirtha</i> called Prithivi, one obtaineth the fruit of the gift of a thousand kine. The pilgrim should next, O king, proceed to Shalukini and bathing there in the Dasaswamedha one obtaineth the merit of ten horse-sacrifices. Proceeding next to <i>Sarpadevi</i>, that excellent <i>tirtha</i> of the Nagas, one obtaineth the merit of the <i>Agnishtoma</i> sacrifice and attaineth to the region of the Nagas. O virtuous one, one should next proceed to <i>Tarantuka</i>, the gatekeeper, and residing there for one night one obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Proceeding next with subdued senses and regulated diet to <i>Panchananda</i> and bathing in the <i>tirtha</i> there, called <i>Koti</i>, one obtaineth the fruit of the horse-sacrifice. Proceeding then to the <i>tirtha</i> of the twin <i>Aswins</i> one obtaineth personal beauty. O virtuous one, one should next proceed to the excellent <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Varaha</i>, where Vishnu formerly stood in the form of a boar. Bathing there one obtaineth, O foremost of men, the merit of the horse-sacrifice. One should next, O king, repair to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Sama</i> in Jayanti. Bathing there one obtaineth the merit of Rajasuya sacrifice. By bathing in <i>Ekahansa</i>, a man obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. O king, a pilgrim repairing to <i>Kritasaucha</i> obtaineth the lotus-eyed deity (Vishnu) and perfect purity of soul. One should next proceed to <i>Munjavata</i>, that spot sacred to the illustrious <i>Sthanu</i>. Residing there without food for one night, one obtaineth the status called <i>Ganapatya</i>. There, O king, is the celebrated <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Yakshini</i>. O king, repairing to that <i>tirtha</i> and bathing there, one obtaineth fruition of all his desires. O bull of the Bharata race, that <i>tirtha</i> is regarded as the gate of <i>Kurukshetra</i>. The pilgrim should with concentrated soul, walk round it. Equal unto the Pushkaras, it was created by the high-souled Rama, the son of Jamadagni. Bathing there and worshipping the <i>Pitris</i> and the gods, one obtaineth, O king, the merit of the horse-sacrifice and becometh successful in everything. The pilgrim should next repair with concentrated soul to the <i>Rama-hrada</i>. There, O king, the heroic Rama of resplendent energy, exterminating the Kshatriyas by his might, dug five lakes and filled them, O tiger among men, with the blood of his victims, as heard by us. And having filled those lakes with Kshatriya blood, Rama offered oblations of blood to his sires and grandsires. Gratified (with the oblations) those Rishis then addressed Rama and said, 'O Rama, O Rama, O thou of great good fortune, we have been gratified with thee, O thou of the Bhrigu race, for this thy regard for the Pitris, and thy prowess, O exalted one! Blessed be thou and ask thou the boon thou</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_175"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 175</FONT></A></p>  
<p>choosest. What is that thou desirest, O thou of great splendour!' Thus addressed (by them), Rama, that foremost of smiters, said with joined hands these words unto the <i>Pitris</i>, stationed in the firmament, 'If ye have been gratified with me, if I have deserved your favour, I desire this favour of the Pitris, <i>viz.,</i> that I may have pleasure again in ascetic austerities. Let me also, through your power, be freed from the sin I have committed by exterminating, from wrath, the Kshatriya race. Let also my lakes become <i>tirthas</i> celebrated over the world. The Pitris, hearing these blessed words of Rama, were highly gratified, and filled with joy they answered him saying, 'Let thy asceticism increase in consequence of thy regard for the Pitris. Thou hast exterminated the Kshatriyas from wrath. Freed art thou already from that sin, for they have perished as a consequence of their own misdeeds. Without doubt, these lakes of thine will become <i>tirthas</i>. And if one, bathing in these lakes, offereth oblations of the water thereof to the <i>Pitris</i>, the latter gratified with him will grant him desire, difficult of fulfilment in the world as also eternal heaven.' O king, having granted him these boons, the Pitris joyfully saluted Rama of the Bhrigu race and disappeared there and then. It was thus that the lakes of the illustrious Rama of the Bhrigu race became sacred. Leading a Brahmacharya mode of life and observing sacred vows, one should bathe in the lakes of Rama. Bathing therein and worshipping Rama, one obtaineth, O king, the merit of gift of gold in abundance. Proceeding next, O son of the Kuru race, to <i>Vansamulaka</i>, a pilgrim by bathing there, raiseth, O king, his own race. O best of the Bharatas, arriving next at the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Kayasodhana</i>, and bathing there, one purifieth, without doubt, his body, and proceeded with purified body to the blessed region of unrivalled excellence. One should next repair, O virtuous one, to that <i>tirtha</i>, celebrated over the three worlds, called <i>Lokoddara</i>, where formerly Vishnu of great prowess had created the worlds. Arriving at that <i>tirtha</i> which is adored by the three worlds one earneth, O king, by bathing there, numerous worlds for himself. Repairing next with subdued soul to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Sree</i>, one acquires, by bathing there and worshipping the Pitris and the gods, high prosperity. Leading a Brahmacharya mode of life and with concentrated soul, one should proceed next to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Kapila</i>. Bathing there and worshipping one's own Pitris and the gods, a man earneth the fruit of the gift of a thousand Kapila kine. Repairing next to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Surya</i> and bathing there with subdued soul and worshipping the Pitris and the gods, fasting all the while, one obtaineth the fruit of the <i>Agnishtoma</i> sacrifice and goeth (finally) to the region of the Sun. The pilgrim by proceeding next to <i>Gobhavana</i> and bathing there obtaineth the merit of the gift of a thousand kine. O son of the Kuru race, a pilgrim by repairing then to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Shankhini</i> and bathing in the <i>Devi-tirtha</i> that is there, obtaineth high prowess. O king, one should then proceed to the <i>tirtha</i> called</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_176"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 176</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> <i>Tarandaka</i> situated in the Saraswati and belonging to the illustrious chief of the Yakshas who is one of the gate-keepers (of Kuvera). O king, bathing there one obtaineth the fruit of the <i>Agnishtoma</i> sacrifice. O virtuous king, one should next repair to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Brahmavarta</i>. Bathing in <i>Brahmavarta</i>, one ascendeth to the abode of Brahma. O king, one should then repair to the excellent <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Sutirtha</i>. There the Pitris are ever present along with the gods. One should bathe there and worship the Pitris and the gods. By so doing, one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice and goeth (finally) into the region of the Pitris. It is for this, O virtuous one, that <i>Sutirtha</i> situate in <i>Amvumati</i> is regarded as so excellent. And, O thou best of the Bharata race, having bathed in the <i>tirtha</i> of <i>Kasiswara</i>, one becometh freed from all diseases and is adored in the abode of Brahma. There, in that <i>tirtha</i>, is another called <i>Matri</i>. One that bathes in <i>Matri tirtha</i> hath a large progeny and obtaineth, O king, great prosperity. One should next proceed with subdued sense and regulated diet to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Shitavana</i>. And, O great king, it hath been seen that one merit of that <i>tirtha</i> which rarely belongs to any other, is that one only going thither obtaineth holiness. By casting off his hair in that <i>tirtha</i> one acquireth, O Bharata, great sanctity. There, in that <i>tirtha</i>, is another called <i>Shwavillomapaha</i>, where, O tiger among men, and chief of the Bharata race, learned Brahmanas that go to <i>tirthas</i> obtain great satisfaction by a dip into its waters. Good Brahmanas, O king, by casting off their hair in that <i>tirtha</i> acquire holiness by <i>Pranayama</i> and finally attain to a high state. There, O king, <i>in that tirtha</i> is also another called <i>Dasaswamedhika</i>. Bathing there, O tiger among men, one attains to a high state. One should next proceed, O king, to the celebrated <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Manusha</i> where, O king, a number of black antelopes afflicted by the hunter's arrows, plunging into its waters, were transformed into human beings. Bathing in that <i>tirtha</i>, leading a <i>Brahmacharya</i> mode of life and with concentrated soul, a man becomes freed from all his sins and is adored in heaven. Distant by a <i>krosa</i>, O king, to the east of <i>Manusha</i> there is a river celebrated by the name of <i>Apaga</i> that is restored to by the <i>Siddhas</i>. The man that offereth there the <i>syamaka</i> grain in honour of the gods and the Pitris acquireth great religious merit. And if one Brahmana is fed there, it becomes equivalent to feeding ten millions of Brahmanas. Having bathed in that <i>tirtha</i> and worshipped the gods and the Pitris and resided there for one night, a man obtaineth the merit of the <i>Agnishtoma</i> sacrifice. One should then repair, O king, to that excellent region of Brahma which, O Bharata, is known on earth by the name of <i>Brahmodumvara</i>. Bathing in the tank of the seven Rishis that is there, O bull among men, with pure mind and subdued soul, as also in the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Kedara</i> of the high-souled <i>Kapila</i>, and beholding Brahma who is there, one's soul being purified from all sins, one goeth to the abode of Brahma. Proceeding next to the inaccessible <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Kedara of Kapila</i>, and burning one's sins</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A></p>  
<p>there by ascetic penances, one acquireth the power of disappearance at will. One should next proceed, O king, to the celebrated <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Saraka</i>, and beholding Mahadeva there on the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight, one obtaineth all his wishes and goeth also into heaven. O son of the Kuru race, in <i>Saraka</i> and <i>Rudrakoti</i> as also in the well and the lakes that are there, thirty millions of <i>tirthas</i> are present. There in that <i>tirtha</i>, O chief of the Bharatas, is another called <i>Ilaspada</i>. Bathing there and worshipping the gods and the Pitris, one never sinketh into hell but obtaineth the fruit of the <i>Vajapeya</i> sacrifice. Repairing next to <i>Kindana</i> and <i>Kinjapya</i>, one acquireth, O Bharata, the merit of giving away in measureless abundance and the infinite recitation of prayers. Repairing next to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Kalasi</i> and bathing there devoutly and with the senses under control, a man obtaineth the fruit of the <i>Agnishtoma</i> sacrifice. To the east of <i>Saraka</i>, O chief of the Kurus, there is an auspicious <i>tirtha</i> known by the name of <i>Anajanma</i>, of the high-souled Narada. He that bathes there, O Bharata, obtaineth, after death, at the command of Narada various unrivalled regions. One should next proceed, on the tenth day of the lighted fortnight, to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Pundarika</i>. Bathing there, O king, one obtaineth the merit of the <i>Pundarika</i> sacrifice. One should next proceed to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Tripishtapa</i> that is known over the three worlds. There in that <i>tirtha</i> is the sacred and sin-destroying river called <i>Vaitarani</i>. Bathing there and adoring the god known by the mark of the bull and holding the trident in his hand, one's soul being purified from every sin one attaineth to the highest state. One should next proceed, O king, to the excellent <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Phalakivana</i>. There in that <i>tirtha</i> the gods, O monarch, having been present, performed their ascetic austerities extending for many thousand years. One should then proceed to the <i>Dhrishadwati</i>. Bathing there and worshipping the gods, one obtaineth, O Bharata, merit that is superior to that of both the <i>Agnishtoma</i> and the <i>Atiratra</i> sacrifices. O chief of the Bharatas, bathing in that <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Sarvadeva</i>, a man obtaineth, O king, the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Bathing next in the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Panikhata</i> and worshipping all the gods, a man obtaineth merit that is superior to that of both the <i>Agnishtoma</i> and the <i>Atiratra</i> sacrifices, besides acquiring that of the <i>Rajasuya</i> sacrifice and finally going into the region of the Rishis. One should next proceed, O virtuous one, to that excellent <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Misraka</i>. There, O tiger among kings, it hath been heard by us that the high-souled Vyasa, for the sake of the Brahmanas, hath mixed all the <i>tirthas</i>. He, therefore, that bathes in <i>Misraka</i> really bathes in all the <i>tirtha</i>. One should next proceed with subdued senses and regulated diet, to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Vyasavana</i>. Bathing in the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Manojava</i> that is there, one obtaineth the merit of the gift of a thousand kine. Proceeding next to the <i>Devi tirtha</i> that is in <i>Madhuvati</i>, one that bathes there and worships the gods and the Pitris obtains at the command of the Goddess the merit of the gift of a</p>

<p>thousand kine. Proceeding with regulated diet, he that bathes in the confluence of the <i>Kausiki</i> and the <i>Drishadwati</i>, becometh free from all his sins. One should next proceed to <i>Vyasasthali</i> where Vyasa of great intelligence, burning with grief for his son had resolved to cast off his body but was cheered again by the gods. Proceeding to that spot of Vyasa, one obtaineth the merit of a thousand kine. O son of the Kuru race, proceeding next to the well called <i>Kindatta</i>, he that throweth into it a measure of sesame, is freed from all his debts and obtaineth his success. Bathing in the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Vedi</i>, one obtaineth the merit of the gift of a thousand kine. There are two other celebrated tirthas called <i>Ahas</i> and <i>Sudina</i>.

Bathing in the <i>Amara-hrada</i> and worshipping with devotion the chief of the celestials, one becometh adored in heaven and courseth, seated on an excellent car, in the company of the immortals.

O son of the Kuru race, one should next repair to <i>Naimishakunja</i>. O king, the Rishis engaged in ascetic austerities in the woods of <i>Naimisha</i> had, in days of old, taking the vow of pilgrimage, gone to Kurukshetra. There, on the banks of the Saraswati, O chief of the Bharatas, a grove was made, which might serve for a resting spot for themselves, and which was highly gratifying to them. Bathing in the <i>Saraswati</i> there, one obtaineth the merit of the <i>Agnishtoma</i> sacrifice. One should next proceed, O virtuous one, to the excellent <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Kanya</i>.

One should then, O best of men, proceed to the excellent <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Soma</i>. Bathing there, O king, one obtaineth the region of <i>Soma</i>. One should next proceed, O king, to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Saptasaraswata</i>, where the celebrated Rishi, Mankanaka, had obtained ascetic success. O king, it hath been</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A></p>  
<p>heard by us that in days of old Mankanaka having cut his hand with the pointed blade of the Kusa grass, there flowed from his wound vegetable juice (instead of blood). And beholding vegetable juice flow from his wound, the Rishi began to dance with wonder-expanded eyes. And as the Rishi danced, all the mobile and immobile creatures also, overwhelmed with his prowess, began to dance with him. Then, O king, the gods with Brahma at their head and Rishis endued with the wealth of asceticism moved by the act of Mankanaka, represented the matter to Mahadeva, saying, 'It behoveth thee, O god, to act in such a way that this Rishi may not dance.' Thus addressed, Mahadeva, with heart filled with joy, approached the dancing Rishi, and moved by the desire of doing good to the gods, said, 'O great Rishi, O virtuous one, why dost thou dance? O bull among Munis, what can be the reason of this thy present joy?' The Rishi answered, 'O best of Brahmanas, I am an ascetic that tread the path of virtue. Dost thou not behold, O Brahmana, that vegetable juice floweth from the wound in my hand? Filled with great joy at sight of this, I am dancing.' Addressing the Rishi blinded by emotion, the god laughingly said, 'O Brahmana, I do not wonder at this. Behold me.' Having said this, O best of men, Mahadeva, O sinless king, pressed his thumb by the tip of his own finger. And, lo, from the wound thus inflicted, there came out ashes white as snow. And beholding this, O king, that Muni became ashamed and fell at the feet of the god. And believing that there was nothing better and greater than the god Rudra, he began to adore him in these words:</p>  
<p>"O holder of the trident, thou art the refuge of the celestials and the Asuras, of, indeed, the universe. By thee have been created the three worlds with their mobile and immobile beings. It is thou again that swallowest everything at the end of the Yuga. Thou art incapable of being known by the gods themselves, far less by me. O sinless one, the gods with Brahma at their heads are all displayed in thee. Thou art all, the Creator himself and the Ordainer of the worlds. It is by thy grace that all the gods sport without anxiety or fear. And adoring Mahadeva thus the Rishi also said, 'O god of gods, grant me thy grace, so that my asceticism may not diminish.' Then that god of cheerful soul answered the regenerate Rishi,--saying, 'Let thy asceticism, O Brahmana, increase a thousandfold through my grace. And, O great Muni, I shall dwell with thee in this thy asylum. Bathing in <i>Saptasaraswata</i>, they that will worship me, shall be able to attain everything here and hereafter. And, without doubt, they shall all attain to the <i>Saraswata</i> region in the end.' Having said this, Mahadeva disappeared then and there.</p>  
<p>"After visiting <i>Saraswata</i>, one should proceed to <i>Ausanasa</i> celebrated over the three worlds. There, O Bharata, the gods with Brahma at their head, and Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism, and the illustrious Kartikeya, were ever present during two twilights and the mid-day, impelled by the desire of doing good to Bhargava. There in that <i>tirtha</i> is another called</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_180"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 180</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> <i>Kapalamochana</i>, which cleanseth from every sin. O tiger among men, bathing there one is cleansed from every sin. One should then proceed to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Agni</i>. Bathing there, O bull among men, one obtaineth the regions of <i>agni</i> and raiseth his own race (from lower regions). There in that <i>tirtha</i> is another, O chief of the Bharatas, that belongeth to Viswamitra. Bathing there, O best of men, one obtaineth the status of a Brahmana. Proceeding next to Brahmayoni in purity of body and with subdued soul, one obtaineth, O tiger among men, by bathing there, the abode of Brahma, and sanctifieth, without doubt, his own race to the seventh generation up and down. One should next proceed, O king, to the <i>tirtha</i> celebrated over the three worlds, which is called <i>Prithudaka</i>, belonging to Kartikeya. One should bathe there and occupy oneself in the worship of the Pitris and the gods. Whatever evil hath been committed, knowingly or unknowingly, by man or woman, impelled by human motives, is all destroyed, O Bharata, by a bath in that <i>tirtha</i>. Bathing there one obtaineth, too, the merit of the horse-sacrifice and heaven also. The learned have said that <i>Kurukshetra</i> is holy; that holier than <i>Kurukshetra</i> is the <i>Saraswati</i>; that holier than the Saraswati are all the <i>tirthas</i> together, and that holier than all the <i>tirthas</i> together is <i>Prithudaka</i>. He that engaged in the recitation of prayers casteth off his body at Prithudaka, which is the best of all <i>tirthas</i>, becometh an immortal. It hath been sung by Sanatkumara and by the high-souled Vyasa, and it is in the Vedas also, that one should, O king, go to Prithudaka, with subdued soul. O son of Kuru race, there is no <i>tirtha</i> which is superior to Prithudaka. Without doubt, that <i>tirtha</i> is purifying, holy and sin-destroying. O best of men, it hath been said by learned persons that men, however sinful, by bathing in Prithudaka, go to heaven. O best of the Bharatas, there in that <i>tirtha</i> is another called <i>Madhusrava</i>. Bathing there, O king, one obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. One should then proceed, O king, to that celebrated and sacred <i>tirtha</i> where the Saraswati uniteth with the Aruna. One that batheth there, having fasted for three nights, is cleansed of even the sin of slaying a Brahmana, and obtaineth also merit that is superior to that of either the <i>Agnishtoma</i> or <i>Atiratra</i> sacrifice, and rescueth his race to the seventh generation up and down. There in that <i>tirtha</i> is another, O perpetuator of the Kuru race, that is called Ardhakila. From compassion for the Brahmanas, that <i>tirtha</i> was made by Darbhi in days of old. Without doubt, by vows, by investiture of the sacred, by fasts, by rites and by <i>Mantras</i>, one becometh a Brahmana. O bull among men, it hath been seen, however, by learned persons of old that even one destitute of rites and <i>Mantras</i>, by only bathing in that <i>tirtha</i> becometh learned and endued with the merit of vows. Darbhi had also brought hither the four oceans. O best of men, one that batheth here, never meeteth with distress hereafter and obtaineth also the merit of giving away four thousand kine. One should next repair, O virtuous one, to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Satasahasraka</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Near to this is another called <i>Sahasraka</i>. Both are celebrated, and one that batheth in them, obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Fasts and gifts there multiply a thousandfold. One should next proceed, O king, to the excellent <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Renuka</i>. One should bathe there and worship the <i>Pitris</i> and the gods. By this, cleansed from every sin, he obtaineth the merit of the <i>Agnishtoma</i> sacrifice. Bathing next in the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Vimochana</i> with passions and senses under control, one is cleansed from all the sins generated by the acceptance of gifts. With senses under control and practising the Brahmacharya mode of life, one should next repair to the woods of Panchavati. By a sojourn thither, one earneth much virtue and becometh adored in the regions of the virtuous. One should next go to the <i>tirtha</i> of <i>Varuna</i> called <i>Taijasa</i>, blazing in effulgence of its own. There in that <i>tirtha</i> is the lord of Yoga, Sthanu himself, having for his vehicle the bull. He that sojourneth there, obtaineth success by worshipping the god of gods. It was there that the gods with Brahma at their head and Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism, installed Guha as the generalissimo of the celestials. To the east of that <i>tirtha</i> is another, O perpetuator of Kuru race, that is called Kuru <i>tirtha</i>. With senses under control and leading a Brahmacharya mode of life, he that bathes in <i>Kuru-tirtha</i>, becometh cleansed of all his sins and obtaineth the region of Brahma. With subdued senses and regulated diet one should next proceed to <i>Svargadwara</i>. Sojourning thither, one obtaineth the merit of the <i>Agnishtoma</i> sacrifice and goeth to the abode of Brahma. The pilgrim should then, O king, proceed to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Anaraka</i>. Bathing there, O king, one never meeteth with distress hereafter. There, O king, Brahma himself with the other gods having Narayana at their head, is ever present, O tiger among men! And, O royal son of the Kuru race, the wife also of Rudra is present there. Beholding the goddess, one never meeteth with distress hereafter. There in that <i>tirtha</i> O king, is also (an image of) <i>Visweswara</i>, the lord of Uma. Beholding the god of gods there, one is cleansed of all his sins. Beholding also (the image of) <i>Narayana</i> from whose navel had sprung the lotus, one blazeth forth, O royal represser of all foes, and goeth to the abode of Vishnu. O bull among men, he that batheth in the <i>tirthas</i> of all the gods, is exempted from every sorrow and blazeth forth like the Moon. The pilgrim should next proceed, O king, to <i>Swastipura</i>. By walking around that place, one obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Arriving next at the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Pavana</i>, one should offer oblations to the <i>Pitris</i> and the gods. By this, he obtaineth, O Bharata, the merit of the <i>Agnishtoma</i> sacrifice. Near to that is <i>Ganga-hrada</i>, and another, O Bharata, called <i>Kupa</i>. Thirty millions of <i>tirthas</i>, O king, are present in that Kupa. Bathing there, O king, a person obtaineth heaven. Bathing also in the <i>Ganga-hrada</i> and adoring Maheswara, one obtaineth the status of <i>Ganapatya</i> and rescueth his own race. One should next proceed to <i>Sthanuvata</i>, celebrated over the</p>

<p>three worlds. Bathing there, O king, one obtaineth heaven. One should then proceed to <i>Vadaripachana</i>, the asylum of <i>Vasishtha</i>. Having tasted there for three nights, one should eat jujubes. He that liveth on jujubes for twelve years, and he that fasteth at the <i>tirtha</i> for three nights, acquireth merit that is eternal. Arriving then at <i>Indramarga</i>, O king, and fasting there for a day and night the pilgrim becometh adored in the abode of Indra. Arriving next at the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Ekaratra</i>, a person that stayeth there for one night, with regulated vows and refraining from untruth, becometh adored in the abode of Brahma. One should next go, O king, to the asylum of <i>Aditya</i>--that illustrious god who is a mass of effulgence. Bathing in that tirtha celebrated over three worlds, and worshipping the god of light, one goeth to the region of Aditya and rescueth his own race. The pilgrim then, O king, bathing in the <i>tirtha</i> of <i>Soma</i>, obtaineth, without doubt, the region of Soma. One should next proceed, O virtuous one, to the most sacred <i>tirtha</i> of the illustrious <i>Dadhicha</i>, that sanctifying <i>tirtha</i> which is celebrated over the whole world. It was here that Angiras, that ocean of ascetic austerities belonging to the Saraswata race, was born, Bathing in that <i>tirtha</i>, one obtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice, and without doubt, gaineth also residence in the legion of Saraswati. With subdued senses and leading a Brahmacharya mode of life, one should next proceed to <i>Kanyasrama</i>. Residing there for three nights, O king, with subdued senses and regulated diet, one obtaineth a hundred celestial damsels and goeth also to the abode of Brahma. One should next, O virtuous one, proceed to the <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Sannihati</i>. Sojourning thither the gods with Brahma at their head and Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism earn much virtue. Bathing in the Saraswati during a solar eclipse, one obtaineth the merit of a hundred horse-sacrifices, and any sacrifice that one may perform there produceth merit that is eternal. Whatever <i>tirthas</i> exist on earth or in the firmament, all the rivers, lakes, smaller lakes, springs, tanks, large and small, and spots sacred to particular gods, without doubt, all come, O tiger among men, month after month, and mingle with <i>Sannihati</i>, O king of men! And it is because that all other <i>tirthas</i> are united together here, that this <i>tirtha</i> is so called. Bathing there and drinking of its water, one becometh adored in heaven. Listen now, O king, to the merit acquired by that mortal who performeth a <i>Sraddha</i> on the day of the new moon during a solar eclipse. The person that performeth a <i>Sraddha</i> there, after having bathed in that <i>tirtha</i>, obtaineth the merit that one earneth by properly celebrating a thousand horse-sacrifices. Whatever sins a man or woman committeth, are, without doubt, all destroyed as soon as one batheth in that <i>tirtha</i>. Bathing there one also ascendeth to the abode of Brahma on the lotus-coloured tar. Bathing next in <i>Koti-tirtha</i>, after having worshipped the Yaksha doorkeeper, Machakruka, one obtaineth the merit of giving away gold in abundance. Near to this, O best of the Bharatas, is a <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Gangahrada</i>.</p>

<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> One should bathe there, O virtuous one, with subdued soul and leading a Brahmacharya mode of life. By this, one obtaineth merit that is greater than that of a Rajasuya and horse-sacrifices. The <i>tirtha</i> called <i>Naimisha</i> is productive of good on earth. <i>Pushkara</i> is productive of good in the regions of the firmament; <i>Kurukshetra</i>, however, is productive of good in respect of all the three worlds. Even the dust of Kurukshetra, carried by the wind, leadeth sinful men to a highly blessed state. They that reside in Kurukshetra, which lieth to the north of the Drishadwati and the south of the Saraswati, really reside in heaven. '<i>I will go to Kurukshetra</i>,' '<i>I will dwell in Kurukshetra</i>,' he that uttereth those words even once, becometh cleansed of all sins. The sacred <i>Kurukshetra</i> which is worshipped by Brahmarshis, is regarded as the sacrificial altar of the celestials. Those mortals that dwell there, have nothing to grieve for at any time. That which lieth between Tarantuka and Arantuka and the lakes of Rama and Machakruka is Kurukshetra. It is also called <i>Samantapanchaka</i> and is said to be the northern sacrificial altar of the Grandsire.'</p>
