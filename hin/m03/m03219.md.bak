# SECTION CCXIX

"Markandeya continued, 'He (*Uktha*) performed a severe penance lasting
for many years, with the view of having a pious son equal unto *Brahma*
in reputation. And when the invocation was made with the *vyahriti*
hymns and with the aid of the five sacred fires, *Kasyapa, Vasistha,
Prana*, the son of *Prana, Chyavana*, the son of *Angiras*, and
*Suvarchaka*--there arose a very bright energy (force) full of the
animating (creative) principle, and of five different colours. Its head
was of the colour of the blazing fire, its arms were bright like the sun
and its skin and eyes were golden-coloured and its feet, O Bharata, were
black. Its five colours were given to it by those five men by reason of
their great penance. This celestial being is therefore described as
appertaining to five men, and he is the progenitor of five tribes. After
having performed a penance for ten thousand years, that being of great
ascetic merit produced the terrible fire appertaining to the *Pitris*
(manes) in order to begin the work of creation, and from his head and
mouth respectively he created Vrihat and Rathantara (day and night) who
quickly steal away (life, &c.). He also created Siva from his navel,
Indra from his might and wind and fire from his soul, and from his two
arms sprang the hymns *Udatta* and *Anudatta*. He also produced the
mind, and the five senses, and other creatures. Having created these, he
produced the five sons of the *Pitris*. Of these *Pranidhi* was the son
of *Vrihadratha*. Vrihadratha was the son of Kasyapa. Bhanu was the
godson of Chyavana, Saurabha, the son of Suvarchaka, and Anudatta, the
son of Prana. These twenty-five beings are reputed (to have been created
by him). Tapa also created fifteen other gods who obstruct
sacrifices <span id="fr_67"></span>[4](#fn_67.md). They are Subhima, Bhima,
Atibhima, Bhimavala, Avala, Sumitra, Mitravana, Mitasina, Mitravardhana
and Mitradharaman, <span id="fr_68"></span>[5](#fn_68.md)

and Surapravira, Vira, Suveka, Suravarchas and Surahantri. These gods
are divided into three classes of five each. Located here in this world,
they destroy the sacrifices of the gods in heaven; they frustrate their
objects and spoil their oblations of clarified butter. They do this only
to spite the sacred fires carrying oblations to the gods. If the
officiating priests are careful, they place the oblations in their
honour outside of the sacrificial altar. To that particular place where
the sacred fire may be placed, they cannot go. They carry the oblation
of their votaries by means of wings. When appeased by hymns, they do not
frustrate the sacrificial rites. Vrihaduktha, another son of Tapa,
belongs to the Earth. He is worshipped here in this world by pious men
performing *Agnihotra* sacrifices. Of the son of Tapa who is known as
Rathantara, it is said by officiating priests that the sacrificial
oblation offered in his honour is offered to Mitravinda. The celebrated
Tapa was thus very happy with his sons."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_67"></span>[448:4](m03219.htm#fr_67.md) In Hindu Mythology
there are no gods who destroy sacrifices. It is only the Asuras who do
so. The Burdwan translator renders this passage,--"fifteen other gods
belonging to western nations or *Asuras*." It is noticeable that the
beings that were denounced as *Asuras* by the Hindus were worshipped as
Gods (*Asuras*) by the followers of Zarathustra.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[448:5](m03219.htm#fr_68.md) In connection with the
names of these Mitra-gods, it is to be remembered that Mitra was the
name of the principal god of the ancient Persians.
