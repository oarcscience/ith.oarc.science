# SECTION IV

"Vaisampayana said,--"After the Pandavas had gone to the forest,
Dhritarashtra the son of Amvika, whose knowledge was his eye, <span
id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) became exceedingly sorrowful. And seated
at his ease the king addressed these words to the virtuous Vidura of
profound intelligence, 'Thy understanding is

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

as clear as that of Bhargava. <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) Thou
knowest also all the subtleties or morality, and thou lookest on all the
Kauravas with an equal eye. O, tell me what is proper for me and them. O
Vidura, things having thus taken their course, what should we do now?
How may I secure the goodwill of the citizens so that they may not
destroy us to the roots? O, tell us all, since thou art conversant with
every excellent expedient.'

"Vidura said, 'The three-fold purposes, O king (*viz.,* profit,
pleasure, and salvation), have their foundations in virtue, and the
sages say that a kingdom also standeth on virtue as its basis.
Therefore, O monarch, according to the best of thy power, cherish thou
virtuously thy own sons and those of Pandu. That virtue had been
beguiled by wicked souls with Suvala's son at their head, when thy sons
invited the righteous Yudhishthira and defeated him in the match at
dice. O king, of this deed of utter iniquity I behold this expiation
whereby, O chief of the Kurus, thy son, freed from sin, may win back his
position among good men. Let the sons of Pandu, obtain that which was
given unto them by thee. For, verily, even this is the highest morality
that a king should remain content with his own, and never covet
another's possessions. Thy good name then would not suffer nor would
family dissensions ensue, nor unrighteousness be thine. This then is thy
prime duty now,--to gratify the Pandavas and disgrace Sakuni. If thou
wishest to restore to thy sons the good fortune they have lost, then, O
king, do thou speedily adopt this line of conduct. If thou dost not act
so, the Kurus will surely meet with destruction, for neither Bhimasena
nor Arjuna, if angry, will leave any of their foes unslain. What is
there in the world which is unattainable to those who cannot among their
warriors *Savyasachin* skilled in arms; who have the *Gandiva*, the most
powerful of all weapons in the world, for their bow; and who have
amongst them the mighty Bhima also as a warrior? Formerly, as soon as
thy son was born, I told thee,--*Forsake thou this inauspicious child of
thine. Herein lieth the good of thy race.*--But thou didst not then act
accordingly. Nor also, O king, have I pointed out to thee the way of thy
welfare. If thou doest as I have counselled, thou shalt not have to
repent afterwards. If thy son consent to reign in peace jointly with the
sons of Pandu, passing thy days in joy thou shalt not have to repent.
Should it be otherwise, abandon thou thy child for thy own happiness.
Putting Duryodhana aside, do thou [install](errata.htm#5.md) the son of
Pandu in the sovereignty, and let, O king, Ajatasatru, free from
passion, rule the earth virtuously. All the kings of the earth, then,
like Vaisyas, will, without delay, pay homage unto us. And, O king, let
Duryodhana and Sakuni and Karna with alacrity wait upon the Pandavas.
And let Dussasana, in open court, ask forgiveness of Bhimasena and of
the daughter of Drupada also.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

\[paragraph continues\] And do thou pacify Yudhishthira by placing him
on the throne with every mark of respect. Asked by thee, what else can I
counsel thee to do? By doing this, O monarch, thou wouldst do what was
proper.'

'Dhritarashtra said, 'These words, O Vidura, then thou hast spoken in
this assembly, with reference to the Pandavas and myself, are for their
good but not for ours. My mind doth not approve them. How hast thou
settled all this in thy mind now? When thou hast spoken all this on
behalf of the Pandavas, I perceive that thou art not friendly to me. How
can I abandon my son for the sake of the sons of Pandu? Doubtless they
are my sons, but Duryodhana is sprung from my body. Who then, speaking
with impartiality, will ever counsel me to renounce my own body for the
sake of others? O Vidura, all that thou sayest is crooked, although I
hold thee in high esteem. Stay or go as thou likest. However much may
she be humoured, an unchaste will forsaketh her husband.'

"Vaisampayana said, O king, saying this Dhritarashtra rose suddenly and
went into the inner apartments. And Vidura, saying 'This race is doomed'
went away to where the sons of Pritha were.'"
