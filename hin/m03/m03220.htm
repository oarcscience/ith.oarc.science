<p>"Markandeya continued, 'The fire called Bharata was bound by severe rules of asceticism. Pushtimati is another name of his fire; for when he is satisfied he vouchsafes <i>pushti</i> (development) to all creatures, and for this reason he is called <i>Bharata</i> (or the Cherisher). And that other fire, by name Siva, is devoted to the worship of Sakti (the forces of the presiding deity of the forces of Nature), and because he always relieves the sufferings of all creatures <A HREF="errata.htm#166">afflicted</A> with misery, he is called Siva (the giver of good). And on the acquisition of great ascetic wealth by <i>Tapa</i>, an intelligent son named Puranda was born to inherit the same. Another son named Ushma was also born. This fire is observed in the vapour of all matter. A third son Manu was born. He officiated as Prajapati. The Brahmanas who are learned in the Vedas, then speak of the exploits of the fire Sambhu. And after that the bright Avasathya fire of great refulgence is spoken of by the Brahmanas. Tapa thus created the five Urjaskara fires, all bright as gold. These all share the <i>Soma</i> drink in sacrifices. The great sun-god when fatigued (after his day's labours) is known as the Prasanta fire. He created the terrible <i>Asuras</i> and various other creatures of the earth. Angiras, too created the <i>Prajapati</i> Bhanu, the son of Tapa. He is also called Vrihadbhanu (the great Bhanu) by Brahmanas learned in the <i>Vedas</i>. Bhanu married Supraja, and Brihadbhanu the daughter of Surya (the sun-god). They gave birth to six sons; do thou hear of their progeny. The fire who gives strength to the weak is called Valada (or the giver of strength). He is the first son of Bhanu, and that other fire who looks terrible when all the elements are in a tranquil state is called the Manjuman fire; he is the second son of Bhanu. And the fire in whose honour oblations of clarified butter are enjoined to be made here at the <i>Darsa</i> and <i>Paurnamasya</i> sacrifices and who is known as Vishnu in this world, is (the third son of Bhanu) called Angiras, or Dhritiman. And the fire to whom with Indra, the <i>Agrayana</i> oblation is enjoined to be made is called the</p>

<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Agrayana fire. He is the (fourth) son of Bhanu. The fifth son of Bhanu is Agraha who is the source of the oblations which are daily made for the performance of the <i>Chaturmasya</i> (four-monthly) rites. And Stuva is the sixth son of Bhanu. Nisa was the name of another wife of that Manu who is known by the name of Bhanu. She gave birth to one daughter, the two Agnishomas, and also five other fire-gods. The resplendent fire-god who is honoured with the first oblations in company with the presiding deity of the clouds is called Vaiswanara. And that other fire who is called the lord of all the worlds is Viswapati, the second son of Manu. And the daughter of Manu is called Swistakrit, because by oblations unto her one acquires great merit. Though she was the daughter of Hiranyakasipu, she yet became his wife for her evil deeds. She is, however, one of the Prajapatis. And that other fire which has its seats in the vital airs of all creatures and animates their bodies, is called Sannihita. It is the cause of our perceptions of sound and form. That divine spirit whose course is marked with black and white stains, who is the supporter of fire, and who, though free from sin, is the accomplisher of desired <i>karma</i>, whom the wise regard as a great <i>Rishi</i>, is the fire Kapila, the propounder of the <i>Yoga</i> system called Sankhya. The fire through whom the elementary spirits always receive the offerings called <i>Agra</i> made by other creatures at the performance of all the peculiar rites in this world is called Agrani. And these other bright fires famous in the world, were created for the rectification of the <i>Agnihotra</i> rites when marred by any defects. If the fires interlap each other by the action of the wind, then the rectification must be made with the <i>Ashtakapala</i> rites in honour of the fire Suchi. And if the southern fire comes in contact with the two other fires, then rectification must be made by the performance of the <i>Ashtakapala</i> rites in honour of the fire Viti. If the fires in their place called Nivesa come in contact with the fire called Devagni, then the <i>Ashtakapala</i> rites must be performed in honour of the fire Suchi for rectification. And if the perpetual fire is touched by a woman in her monthly course, then for rectification the <i>Ashtakapala</i> rites must be performed in honour of the fire called Dasyuman. If at the time of the performance of this <i>Agnihotra</i> rites the death of any creature is spoken of, or if animals die, then rectification must be made with the performance of the <i>Ashtakapala</i> rites in honour of the Suraman fire. The Brahmana, who while suffering from a disease is unable to offer oblations to the sacred fire for three nights, must make amends for the same by performing the <i>Ashtakapala</i> rites in honour of the northern fire. He who has performed the <i>Darsa</i> and the <i>Paurnamasya</i> rites must make the rectification with the performance of the <i>Ashtakapala</i> rites in honour of the Patikrit fire. If the fire of a lying-in room comes in contact with the perpetual sacred fire, then rectification must be made with the performance of <i>Ashtakapala</i> rites in honour of the Agniman fire.'"</p>
