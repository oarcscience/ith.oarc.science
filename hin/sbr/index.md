*The gods love the mysterious*--Satapatha Brahmana, 6:7:1:23

This is the main index for the Satapatha Brahmana translation. The
Satapatha Brahmana is a Hindu sacred text which describes details of
Vedic rituals, including philosophical and mythological background. It
was committed to writing about 300 B.C.E., although it contains portions
which are far older, transmitted orally from unknown antiquity.
Specifically, there are references throughout to a primal mother-Earth
worship, unnamed snake deities and human sacrifice. There are also
recitations of key Vedic-era myths, including the [flood of
Manu](sbe12/sbe1234) and an extended [Creation myth](sbe41/sbe4128.md)
which includes the 'cosmic egg' motif (see, *e.g.*, the Finnish
[Kalevala](../../neu/kveng/kvrune01).md). Of course, this is a very ancient
text which bears the same relationship to current Hindu beliefs and
practice as ancient Mediterranean mystery religions do to modern
Christianity. That said, the Satapatha Brahmana is a gold-mine for
scholars of mythology and comparative religion, and this is the only
available complete translation.
