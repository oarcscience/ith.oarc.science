### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:1">12:5:2:1</span></span>1. Now,
Nâka Maudgalya once said, 'If he believe the Sacrificer to be about to
die, let him take

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

up the two fires in the churning-sticks, and, having churned out (a new
fire), let him continue offering (the Agnihotra) at whatever place may
have commended itself to him for the immolation <span
id="fr_545"></span>[1](#fn_544). And if the Sacrificer should then
depart this world,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:2">12:5:2:2</span></span>2. Let
him build a pile for him <span id="fr_546"></span>[2](#fn_545) in the
midst of his fires, and, by burning him, unite him with his fires.' But
let him not do this; for, verily, that (fire) does not submit thereto
that they should make offering to it as for the burning of a dead body:
it is rather to sacrifice and oblations that it submits, and, unable to
endure it, it stays by him with impatience.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:3">12:5:2:3</span></span>3. He
should rather proceed thus:--let him bid them seek three pots, and,
having put therein either (dried) cowdung or straw <span
id="fr_547"></span>[3](#fn_546), let him place them separately on the
(three) fires; and let them then burn him by means of the fires produced
from that blaze: in this way he is indeed burned by (these) fires,
though not visibly, so to speak.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:4">12:5:2:4</span></span>4.
Wherefore, also, it has been said by the *Ri*shi (Vâ*g*. S. XIII,
45 <span id="fr_548"></span>[4](#fn_547)), 'The Agni who was born from
Agni, from the pain of the earth or be it of the sky; whereby
Vi*s*vakarman begat

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

living beings, him, O Agni, may thy wrath spare!' As the verse, so its
explanation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:5">12:5:2:5</span></span>5. Now,
in the first place, he cleanses him of all foul matter, and causes the
foul matter to settle on this (earth); for this (earth) is indeed foul
matter: he thus consigns foul matter to foul matter. For, indeed, from
that intestine of his, filled with foul matter, when it is burnt, a
jackal is produced: (hence he removes it), 'lest a jackal should be
produced.' But let him not do this, or his family will be liable to
starve. Having washed him out inside, he anoints him with ghee, and thus
makes it (the body) sacrificially pure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:6">12:5:2:6</span></span>6. He
then inserts seven chips of gold in the seven seats of his vital airs;
for gold is light and immortality: he thus bestows light and immortality
on him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:7">12:5:2:7</span></span>7.
Having then built a pile for him in the midst of his fires, and spread
out a black antelope skin with the hairy side upwards, and the neck-part
towards the east, he lays him down thereon with the face looking
upwards, and puts the *g*uhû-spoon filled with ghee on his right, and
the upabh*ri*t on his left hand, the dhruvâ on the breast, the
Agnihotra-ladle on the mouth, two dipping-spoons on the nostrils, two
prâ*s*itra-hara*n*as <span id="fr_549"></span>[1](#fn_548) on the ears,
the cup used for carrying forward the lustral water on the head, two
winnowing-baskets at the sides, on the belly the vessel used for holding
the cuttings (of the i*d*â), filled with clotted ghee, the wedge
(yoke-pin) beside the male organ, two mallets beside the testicles, and
behind them the mortar and pestle,

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

the other sacrificial vessels between the thighs; and the wooden sword
on the right hand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:8">12:5:2:8</span></span>8. Thus
supplied with the sacrificial weapons (implements), that Sacrificer
passes on to that place which has been won by him in heaven, even as if
one who fears spoliation were to escape it; and, verily, those fires
(which are) to be enkindled (will) lovingly touch him, even as sons
lovingly touch their father when he comes home after staying abroad, and
make everything ready for him <span id="fr_550"></span>[1](#fn_549).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:9">12:5:2:9</span></span>9. If
the Gârhapatya were to reach him first, one may know that the permanent
fire has reached him first: that he will permanently establish himself,
and that those behind him will permanently establish themselves in this
world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:10">12:5:2:10</span></span>10.
And if the Âhavanîya were to do so, one may know that the foremost fire
has reached him first: that he has been foremost in conquering the
(other) world, and that those behind him will be foremost in this world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:11">12:5:2:11</span></span>11.
And if the Anvâhâryapa*k*ana were to do so, one may know that the
food-eating fire has reached him first: that he will eat food, and that
those behind him will eat food (be prosperous) in this world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:12">12:5:2:12</span></span>12.
And if they all (were to reach him) at the same time, one may know that
he has conquered a blessed world. Such, then, are the distinctions in
this respect.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:13">12:5:2:13</span></span>13.
This, then, is that offering of the Sacrificer's body which he performs
at the end: front out of that place which has been won by him in heaven
he arises immortal in the form of an oblation.

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:14">12:5:2:14</span></span>14.
Whatever stone and earthen (vessels of the deceased) there are they may
be given to a Brâhma*n*a <span id="fr_551"></span>[1](#fn_550); but,
verily, he who accepts them is regarded as a remover of corpses. Let
them rather throw these (vessels) into the water, for the waters are the
foundation of all this (universe): he thus establishes him firmly on the
waters.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:5:2:15">12:5:2:15</span></span>15.
Either a son (of the deceased), or a brother, or some other Brâhma*n*a
then performs that offering <span id="fr_552"></span>[2](#fn_551), with
(Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 22), 'From out of him thou (O Agni) art born: from out
of thee let this N.N. be born again into the heavenly world, hail! They
then go away without looking back. and touch water.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_544"></span>[202:1](sbe44063.htm#fr_545) Literally, at any
place at which the cutting up may have commended itself to him (to take
place). Whether this 'cutting up' is here to be taken figuratively of
the burning of the corpse (dâhasthâne, Harisvâmin), or of the sacrifice
of a barren cow, which may be performed in such a case, or of both, is
not quite clear.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[202:2](sbe44063.htm#fr_546) The construction
would rather seem to be,--let him build him (i.e. the dead body) up as a
pile amidst his fires.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[202:3](sbe44063.htm#fr_547) The real meaning
of '*s*umbala' is not known,--acc. to the St. Petersb. Dict., some
material which readily takes fire, such as straw or oakum. Harisvâmin
takes it in the former sense,--t*rin*âny alpasa*m*sthitâni. Cf. Kâty.
XXV, 7, 12 (?dried cotton fibre or pods).

<span id="fn_547"></span>[202:4](sbe44063.htm#fr_548) Cf. VII, 5, 2, 21.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[203:1](sbe44063.htm#fr_549) That is, two bowls
used for holding the Brahman's 'fore-portions'; see part i, p. 69, note
4.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[204:1](sbe44063.htm#fr_550) That is, they make
everything comfortable for him, make him feel at home:--prak*ri*sh*t*am
evaina*m* svarge kalpayanti pratish*th*itam; nityasthitatvât
pratish*th*â gârhapatya*h*; comm.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[205:1](sbe44063.htm#fr_551) According to Kâty.
XXV, 7, 32, 33 the stone and earthen implements are to be thrown into
the water; and metal ones may optionally be given to a Brahman (or
likewise be thrown into the water).

<span id="fn_551"></span>[205:2](sbe44063.htm#fr_552) According to Katy.
XXV, 7, 34-37 a sterile cow may he offered prior to (or along with) the
burning of the body: in which case the victim is to be killed by a blow
behind the ear, and its kidneys are to be placed in the deceased's
hands, whilst his face is to be covered with the omentum or membrane
enclosing the intestines. The final offering referred to in the above
passage consists of an oblation of ghee.
