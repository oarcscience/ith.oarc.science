### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:3:1">11:8:3:1</span></span>1.
Here, now, they say, 'To what deity should this victim belong?'--'It
should belong to Pra*g*âpati,' they say; 'for it was Pra*g*âpati who
first saw it: therefore it is to Pra*g*âpati that this victim should
belong.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:3:2">11:8:3:2</span></span>2. And
they also say, 'To Sûrya (the sun) that victim should belong;'--whence
it is that cattle are tied up when he (the sun) has set: some of them

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

they tie up <span id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_395.md) in their respective
stables, and others just flock together:--'therefore,' they say, 'it is
to Sûrya that this victim should belong.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:3:3">11:8:3:3</span></span>3. And
they also say, 'To Indra and Agni that victim should belong; for behind
these two deities are (all) the other gods;--if one who is afflicted
sacrifices, those two (gods) sustain him; and if one sacrifices with (a
desire for) abundance <span id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_396.md), they
sustain him: therefore it is to Indra and Agni that this victim should
belong.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:3:4">11:8:3:4</span></span>4. The
animal sacrifice, indeed, is the breath, whence, as long as one lives,
no other has power over his cattle, for they are tied to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:3:5">11:8:3:5</span></span>5.
Pra*g*âpati said to Agni, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will
lay hands upon thee (as a victim).'--'Nay,' said he, 'speak unto man!'
He said to man, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands
upon thee.'--'Nay,' said he, 'speak unto the cattle!' He said to the
cattle, 'I will perform sacrifice with you: I will lay hands upon
you.'--'Nay,' said they, 'speak unto the moon!' He said to the moon, 'I
will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon thee,'--'Nay,'
said he, 'speak unto the sun!' He said to the sun, 'I will perform
sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon thee.' 'So be it!' said he;
'but seeing that those liked it not (to be slaughtered), what, then,
shall become mine that now is with these <span
id="fr_397"></span>[3](#fn_397.md)?'--'Whatsoever

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

thou mayest desire,' he said.--'So be it,' he replied. He laid hands
upon him, and this is that animal of his seized (for sacrifice). When
slaughtered, it swelled, and by means of those Âprî-hymns, he appeased
it <span id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_398.md); and inasmuch as, by means of
these Âprî-hymns, he appeased it, they are called Âprîs. And let him,
for that reason, say of the slaughtered animal, 'Let it lie for a
moment!' As great as the world is which he gains by performing the
horse-sacrifice, so great a world does he gain by this (animal
sacrifice).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:3:6">11:8:3:6</span></span>6. The
(wind of the) eastern region breathed over that (dead victim), saying,
'Breathe forth!' and thereby laid the breath (of the mouth) into it; the
southern region breathed over it, saying, 'Breathe through!' and thereby
laid the through-breathing into it; the western region breathed over it,
saying, 'Breathe off!' and thereby laid the off-breathing into it; the
northern region breathed over it, saying, 'Breathe up!' and thereby laid
the up-breathing (of the nostrils) into it; the upper region breathed
over it, saying, 'Breathe all about!' and thereby laid the circulating
breathing into it. Therefore, regarding a new-born son, let him say to
five Brâhma*n*as, before the navel-string has been cut, 'Breathe over
him in this way <span id="fr_399"></span>[2](#fn_399.md)!' But if he should
be unable to obtain them he may even

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

himself breathe over him whilst walking round him; and that (son of his)
attains the full measure of life <span id="fr_400"></span>[1](#fn_400.md)
and lives to old age.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:3:7">11:8:3:7</span></span>7. He
(the sun) took unto himself Agni's breath; whence that (fire) does not
blaze unless fanned or kindled, for its breath has been taken from it;
and, verily, he who knows this takes away the breath of life from his
spiteful enemy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:3:8">11:8:3:8</span></span>8. He
took to himself Vâyu's form; whence people hear it (the wind), as it
were, shaking, but do not see it, for its form has been taken from it;
and, verily, he who knows this takes away the form of his spiteful
enemy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:3:9">11:8:3:9</span></span>9. He
took to himself man's thought; whence people say, 'The divine thought
protect thee, man's thought me!' for his thought has been taken from
him; and, verily, he who knows this takes away the thought of his
spiteful enemy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:3:10">11:8:3:10</span></span>10.
He took to himself the eye of cattle; whence, even whilst seeing
clearly, as it were, they do not know anything, but only know what it is
when they smell at it, for their eye has been taken from them; and,
verily, he who knows this takes away the eye of his spiteful enemy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:3:11">11:8:3:11</span></span>11.
He took to himself the moon's shine; whence of these two (sun and moon),
though being similar, the moon shines much less, for its shine has been
taken from it; and, verily, he who knows this takes away the shine from
his spiteful enemy. And inasmuch as he took these away (â-dâ), he (the
sun) is called Âditya.

sense of 'to fill up.'

having been placed in the direction of the respective quarters, the
father makes one after the other breathe upon the child,--the first from
the east and the child's head, the second from the right side, &c., in
sunwise succession; the fifth (whose position is not specified)
breathing right down upon the child.
