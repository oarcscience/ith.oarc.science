### SIXTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:1">13:2:6:1</span></span>1. \[He
puts the horse to the chariot <span id="fr_796"></span>[2](#fn_792) with
Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 5\], 'They harness the ruddy bay,

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

moving (round the moveless: the lights shine in the heavens);'--the
ruddy bay, doubtless, is yonder sun: it is yonder sun he harnesses for
him, for the gaining of the heavenly world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:2">13:2:6:2</span></span>2.
Concerning this they say, 'Surely, the sacrifice goes from him whose
beast, when brought up, goes elsewhere than the vedi (altar-ground).'
\[Let him, therefore, mutter Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 7,\] 'Singer of praise,
make that horse come back to us by that path!'--the singer of praise,
doubtless, is Vâyu (the wind) it is him he thereby places for him (the
Sacrificer) on the other side, and so it does not go beyond that.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:3">13:2:6:3</span></span>3. But,
indeed, fiery mettle and energy, cattle, and prosperity depart from him
who offers the A*s*vamedha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:4">13:2:6:4</span></span>4. With
(Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 8), 'May the Vasus anoint thee with the Gâyatra
metre!' the queen consort anoints (the forepart of the unharnessed
horse);--ghee is fiery mettle, and the Gâyatrî also is fiery mettle: two
kinds of fiery mettle he thus bestows together on him (the Sacrificer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:5">13:2:6:5</span></span>5.
With, 'May the Rudras anoint thee with the Traish*t*ubha metre!' the
(king's) favourite wife anoints (the middle part):--ghee is fiery
mettle, and the Trish*t*ubh is energy: both fiery

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

mettle and energy he thus bestows together on him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:6">13:2:6:6</span></span>6.
With, 'May the Âdityas anoint thee with the *G*âgata metre!' a discarded
wife <span id="fr_797"></span>[1](#fn_793) (of the king) anoints (the
hindpart);--ghee is fiery mettle, and the *G*agatî is cattle: both fiery
mettle and cattle he thus bestows together on him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:7">13:2:6:7</span></span>7. It
is the wives <span id="fr_798"></span>[2](#fn_794) that anoint (the
horse), for they to wit, (many) wives--are a form of prosperity (or
social eminence): it is thus prosperity he confers on him (the
Sacrificer), and neither fiery spirit, nor energy, nor cattle, nor
prosperity pass away from him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:8">13:2:6:8</span></span>8. But
even as some of the offering-material may get spilled before it is
offered, so (part of) the victim is here spilled in that the hair of it
when wetted comes off. When they (the wives) weave pearls (into the mane
and tail) they gather up its hair. They are made of gold: the
significance of this has been explained. A hundred and one pearls they
weave into (the hair of) each part <span
id="fr_799"></span>[3](#fn_795); for man has a life of a hundred
(years), and his own self (or body) is the one hundred and first: in
vital power, in the self, he establishes himself. They weave them in
(each) with (one of) the (sacred utterings) relating to Pra*g*âpati,
'Bû*h*! bhuva*h*! svar (earth, air,

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

heaven)!' for the horse is sacred to Pra*g*âpati: with its own deity he
thus supplies it. With, 'Parched grain, or parched groats?--in
grain-food and in food from the cow'--he takes down the remaining
food <span id="fr_800"></span>[1](#fn_796) (from the cart) for the
horse: he thereby makes the (king's) people eaters of food
(prosperous);--'eat ye, gods, this food! eat thou, Pra*g*âpati, this
food!' he thereby supplies the people with food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:9">13:2:6:9</span></span>9.
Verily, fiery spirit and spiritual lustre pass away from him who
performs the A*s*vamedha. The Hot*ri* and the Brahman engage in a
Brahmodya <span id="fr_801"></span>[2](#fn_797) (theological
discussion); for the Hot*ri* relates to Agni, and the Brahman (priest)
to B*ri*haspati, B*ri*haspati being the Brahman (n.): fiery spirit <span
id="fr_802"></span>[3](#fn_798) and spiritual lustre he thus bestows
together on him. With the (central) sacrificial stake between them, they
discourse together; for the stake is the Sacrificer <span
id="fr_803"></span>[4](#fn_799): he thus encompasses the Sacrificer on
both sides with fiery spirit and spiritual lustre.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:10">13:2:6:10</span></span>10.
\[The Brahman asks,  Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 9,\] 'Who is it that walketh
singly?'--it is yonder sun, doubtless, that walks singly <span
id="fr_804"></span>[5](#fn_800), and he is spiritual

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

lustre: spiritual lustre the two (priests) thus bestow on him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:11">13:2:6:11</span></span>11.
'Who is it that is born again?'--it is the moon, doubtless, that is born
again (and -again): vitality they thus bestow on him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:12">13:2:6:12</span></span>12.
'What is the remedy for cold?'--the remedy for cold, doubtless, is Agni
'(fire): fiery spirit they thus bestow on him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:13">13:2:6:13</span></span>13.
'And what is the great vessel?'--the great vessel, doubtless, is this
(terrestrial) world: on this earth he thus establishes himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:14">13:2:6:14</span></span>14.
\[The Hot*ri* asks the Brahman, Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 11,\] 'What was the
first conception?'--the first conception, doubtless, was the sky, rain:
the sky, rain, he thus secures for himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:15">13:2:6:15</span></span>15.
'Who was the great bird <span id="fr_805"></span>[1](#fn_801)?'--the
great bird, doubtless, was the horse:. vital power he thus secures for
himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:16">13:2:6:16</span></span>16.
'Who was the smooth one?'--the smooth one (pilippilâ), doubtless, was
beauty (*s*rî <span id="fr_806"></span>[2](#fn_802)): beauty he thus
secures for himself.

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:6:17">13:2:6:17</span></span>17.
'Who was the tawny one?'--the two tawny ones, doubtless, are the day and
the night <span id="fr_807"></span>[1](sbe44089.htm#fn_803): in the day
and night he thus establishes himself.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_792"></span>[311:2](sbe44088.htm#fr_796) Along with the
sacrificial horse three other horses are put to the chariot, with the
formula Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 6. Previously to this, however, the Hot*ri*
recites eleven verses in praise of the horse (cf. [XIII, 5, 1,
16](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:16)). Both the horses and the chariot are
decorated <span id="page_312">p. 312</span> with gold ornaments. The
Adhvaryu then drives with the Sacrificer to a pond of water to the east
of the sacrificial ground (an indispensable feature in choosing the
place of sacrifice), and having driven into the water he makes him
pronounce the formula XXIII, 7, 'When the wind hath entered the waters,
the dear form of Indra, do thou, singer of praise, make that horse come
back to us by that path;' whereupon they return to the sacrificial
ground.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[313:1](sbe44088.htm#fr_797) That is, a former
favourite, but now neglected; or, according to others, one who has borne
no son.

<span id="fn_794"></span>[313:2](sbe44088.htm#fr_798) The fourth and
lowest wife of the King the Pâlâgalî (cf. [XIII, 4, 1,
8](sbe44102.htm#13:4:1:8); [5, 2, 8](sbe44107.htm#13:5:2:8)), though
present at the sacrifice, does not take part in this ceremony, probably
on account of her low-caste origin, as the daughter of a messenger, or
courier.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[313:3](sbe44088.htm#fr_799) Viz. either the
mane on both sides, and the tail, or the hair of the head, the neck
(mane) and the tail; each of the ladies apparently taking one of these
parts.

<span id="fn_796"></span>[314:1](sbe44088.htm#fr_800) Viz. the material
left over after what was taken for the Annahomas, [XIII, 2, 1,
1](sbe44083.htm#13:2:1:1) seqq.

<span id="fn_797"></span>[314:2](sbe44088.htm#fr_801) For a similar
discussion between the four priests, prior to the offering of the
omenta, see [XIII, 5, 2, 11](sbe44107.htm#13:5:2:11) seq.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[314:3](sbe44088.htm#fr_802) 'Te*g*as' is
pre-eminently the quality assigned to Agni.

<span id="fn_799"></span>[314:4](sbe44088.htm#fr_803) It must be
remembered that the sacrificial horse here represented by the stake is
identified with both Pra*g*âpati and the Sacrificer.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[314:5](sbe44088.htm#fr_804) The actual replies
to the questions in Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 9 and 11, are contained in the
corresponding verses ten and twelve; being given here in an expository
way, with certain variations and <span id="page_315">p. 315</span>
occasional explanatory words (such as 'v*ri*sh*t*i,' rain, in [paragraph
14](sbe44088.htm#13:2:6:14)). The answers to the first four questions
are supposed to be given by the Hot*ri*, and the last four by the
Brahman.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[315:1](sbe44088.htm#fr_805) This is the
meaning assigned here to 'vayas' by Mahîdhara; but the other meaning of
'vayas,' viz. 'youthful vigour, or age, (generally),' would seem to suit
much better, or at least to be implied. And Harisvâmin accordingly takes
it in the sense of 'vârdhakam' (old age, or long life). Mahîdhara,
moreover, identifies the horse with the horse-sacrifice, which, in the
shape of a bird, carries the Sacrificer up to heaven. On this notion cp.
part iv, introduction, pp. xxi-xxii.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[315:2](sbe44088.htm#fr_806) Instead of
'*s*rî*h*,' the answer given to this question in Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 12 was
'avi*h*' which would either mean 'the gentle, kindly one,' or 'the sheep
(f.),' but which Mahîdhara (in the former sense) <span id="page_316">p.
316</span> takes as (an epithet of) the earth which he also takes
'*s*rî' to mean in the above passage of the Brâhma*n*a; whilst to the
ἅπαξ λεγόμενον 'pilippilâ' he assigns the meaning 'slippery'
(*k*ikka*n*a) as applying to the earth after rain (? deriving it from
the root 'lip,' to smear, anoint). Harisvâmin, on the other hand, takes
'pilippilâ' to be an onomatopoetic word, in the sense of '(glossy),
beautiful, shining':--rûpânukarana*s*abdo<sup>ऽ</sup>ya*m* bahurûpâvilâ
(? bahurûpânvitâ) uddyotavatî; and he adds:--*s*rîmî*m*tratu*h* (?
*s*rîr mantre tu) avi*h* pippaloktau (?) sâ tu *s*rîr eveti brâhma*n*e
viv*ri*ta*m*, katham, iya*m* vâ avi*h* p*ri*thivî, sâ *k*a *s*rî*h*,
*s*rîr vâ iyam iti va*k*anât. Cf. VI, 1, 2, 33.
