### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:1">12:2:4:1</span></span>1. The
Year, indeed, is Man;--the Prâya*n*îya Atirâtra is his breath, for by
means of the breath men go forward (prayanti); and the Ârambha*n*îya

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (opening)
day <span id="fr_473"></span>[1](#fn_473.md) is speech, for by means of
speech men undertake (ârabh) whatever they do undertake.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:2">12:2:4:2</span></span>2. The
Abhiplava-sha*d*aha is this right hand <span
id="fr_474"></span>[2](#fn_474). This (little finger.md) is the first day
thereof,--this (upper joint <span id="fr_475"></span>[3](#fn_475).md)is its
morning-service, this (middle joint) its midday-service, and this (lower
joint) its evening-service: it is in place of the Gâyatrî, whence this
(little finger) is the shortest of these (fingers).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:3">12:2:4:3</span></span>3. This
(third finger) is the second day,--this (upper joint) is its
morning-service, this (middle joint) its midday-service, and this (lower
joint) its evening-service: it is in place of the Trish*t*ubh, whence
this (third finger) is larger than this (little finger).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:4">12:2:4:4</span></span>4. This
(middle finger) is the third day,--this is its morning-service, this its
midday-service, and this its evening-service: it is in place of the
*G*agatî, whence this is the largest of these (fingers).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:5">12:2:4:5</span></span>5. This
(fore-finger) is the fourth day,--this is its morning-service, this its
midday-service, and this its evening-service: it is in place of the
Virâ*g*; for the Virâ*g* is food, whence this (fore-finger) is the most
food-eating <span id="fr_476"></span>[4](#fn_476) of these (fingers.md).

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:6">12:2:4:6</span></span>6. This
(thumb) is the fifth day,--this is its morning-service, this its
midday-service, and this its evening-service: it is in place of the
Paṅkti, for the Paṅkti is broad <span id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_477.md),
as it were, whence this (thumb) is the broadest of these (fingers).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:7">12:2:4:7</span></span>7. This
(right arm) is the sixth day,--this (forearm <span
id="fr_478"></span>[2](#fn_478).md) is its morning-service, this (upper
arm) its midday-service, and this (shoulder-blade) its evening-service:
it is in place of the Ati*kh*andas, whence this (arm) is larger than
those (fingers). That day is a Gâyatrî one, whence this shoulder-blade
is the shortest: this Abhiplava-sha*d*aha (extends) in this, in this, in
this, and in this, direction <span id="fr_479"></span>[3](#fn_479.md); and
the P*ri*sh*th*ya is the body (trunk).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:8">12:2:4:8</span></span>8. Now,
as to this, Paiṅgya, knowing this, said, 'The Abhiplavas leap about
(plavante), as it were, and the P*ri*sh*th*ya stands (sthâ) <span
id="fr_480"></span>[4](#fn_480.md), as it were; for

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

this (man) leaps about, as it were, with his limbs, and he stands, as it
were, with his body.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:9">12:2:4:9</span></span>9. The
Triv*ri*t (stoma) is its head, whence that (head) is threefold
(triv*ri*t)--skin, bone, and brain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:10">12:2:4:10</span></span>10.
The Pa*ñk*ada*s*a (fifteen-versed hymn-form) is the neck-joints,--for
there are fourteen of these (joints) <span
id="fr_481"></span>[1](#fn_481.md), and the vital force is the fifteenth;
hence by means of that (neck), though being small, man bears a heavy
burden: therefore the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a is the neck.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:11">12:2:4:11</span></span>11.
The Saptada*s*a (seventeen-versed hymn-form) is the chest; for there are
eight '*g*atru <span id="fr_482"></span>[2](#fn_482.md)' on the one

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

side, and eight on the other, and the chest itself is the seventeenth:
therefore the Saptada*s*a (stoma) is the chest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:12">12:2:4:12</span></span>12.
The Ekavi*ms*a (twenty-one-versed hymn-form) is the belly, for inside
the belly there are twenty 'kuntâpa <span
id="fr_483"></span>[1](#fn_483.md),' and the belly is the twenty-first:
therefore the Ekavi*ms*a (stoma) is the belly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:13">12:2:4:13</span></span>13.
The Tri*n*ava (thrice nine-versed hymn-form) is the two sides
(pâr*s*va);--there are thirteen ribs (par*s*u) on the one side, and
thirteen on the other <span id="fr_484"></span>[2](#fn_484.md), and the
sides make up the thrice ninth: therefore the Tri*n*ava (stoma) is the
two sides.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:14">12:2:4:14</span></span>14.
The Trayastri*ms*a (thirty-three-versed hymn-form)

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

is the spine; for there are thirty-two 'karûkara <span
id="fr_485"></span>[1](#fn_485)' of that (spine.md), and the spine itself
is the thirty-third: therefore the Trayastri*ms*a (stoma) is the spine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:15">12:2:4:15</span></span>15.
The Abhi*g*it is the same as this right ear; the first Svarasâman is
this white part of the eye, the second the black part, and the third the
pupil; the Vishuvat is the nose, the first backward Svarasâman is this
pupil of the eye, the second the black, and the third the white part
thereof.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:4:16">12:2:4:16</span></span>16.
The Vi*s*va*g*it is the same as this left ear; the P*ri*sh*th*ya and
Abhiplava have been told; the Go and Âyus are the two downward
breathings which there are (in the body); the Da*s*arâtra the limbs, the
Mahâvrata is the mouth; and the Udayanîya Atirâtra the up-breathing, for
by means of the up-breathing men go upwards (ud-yanti): such is that
year as established in the body; and, verily, whosoever thus knows that
year as established in the body, establishes himself by offspring and
cattle in this, and by immortality in the other, world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_473"></span>[161:1](sbe44052.htm#fr_473.md) Hereby the
*K*aturvi*ms*a day would seem to be meant (as, indeed, it is also taken
by Harisvâmin, see [p. 157](sbe44051.htm#page_157.md), note
[2](sbe44051.htm#fn_470);[\*](errata.htm#1.md) [p.
167](sbe44053.htm#page_167), note [1](sbe44053.htm#fn_487.md).

<span id="fn_474"></span>[161:2](sbe44052.htm#fr_474.md) The right hand is
apparently taken here to represent the four limbs--the arms and legs. In
Sanskrit the terms for finger and toe (as for thumb and large toe) are
the same.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[161:3](sbe44052.htm#fr_475.md) That is,
apparently the bone joining the palm; though possibly the one forming
the extreme end of the finger may be intended. But inasmuch as the
morning-service has five stotras as compared with the two of the
evening-service the former might be expected to be compared with the
larger of the two bones.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[161:4](sbe44052.htm#fr_476.md) Prof. Weber,
Prati*gñ*âsûtra, p. 97, refers to II, 4, 2, 18, where, in his opinion,
the passage '(thus) they ladle out (food) for men' <span
id="page_162">p. 162</span> points to the fore-finger as the finger used
most in eating. This is not improbable, though Sâya*n*a, as well as the
commentary on Katy. IV, 1, 10, it is true, does not interpret the
passage in that way.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[162:1](sbe44052.htm#fr_477.md) Viz. inasmuch as
it consists of five pâdas,--instead of three, as in the case of the
Gâyatrî, or four, as in that of the others.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[162:2](sbe44052.htm#fr_478.md) Thus also
Harisvâmin (hardly, the palm; but see [p. 161](#page_161.md), note
[3](#fn_475).md).

<span id="fn_479"></span>[162:3](sbe44052.htm#fr_479.md) Viz. in the
direction of the two arms and the two legs. There being, in nine of the
twelve months of the year, four Abhiplavas and one P*ri*sh*th*ya in each
month, the two kinds of six-days’ performances as regards numbers,
certainly offer an analogy to the limbs and the body.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[162:4](sbe44052.htm#fr_480.md) This etymological
quibble seems to refer to the fact that the Abhiplavas are performed
before the P*ri*sh*th*ya in the first half of the year, and after them
in the second half; though the same feature of change might, vice versa,
be applied to the P*ri*sh*th*ya. It is possible, however, that the
author may refer here to other characteristic features of the two kinds
of Sha*d*ahas; and it cannot be denied that the Abhiplava days are
liable to much greater change than the P*ri*sh*th*ya days. The constant
change in the <span id="page_163">p. 163</span> 'sequence of stomas' in
the Abhiplava has already been referred to ([p.
148](sbe44049.htm#page_148), note [1](sbe44050.htm#fn_445).md). Another
source of change, in the Abhiplava, is the peculiar way in which the
Brahmasâman (or Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin's P*ri*sh*th*astotra) is varied
from day to day. For, whilst during the months preceding the Vishuvat
day, the Abhîvarta tune it used for this stotra on each day, but with
different Pragâtha verses chanted thereto from day to day; during the
second half of the year, on the other hand, the same text (Sâma-veda II,
806) is used throughout, whilst its tune is varied from day to day.
Since in the second half of the year the order of the days of the
P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha must be reversed, whilst this is optionally the
case as regards the Abhiplava, this feature can hardly be referred to
here.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[163:1](sbe44052.htm#fr_481.md) The 'grîvâ*h*'
thus, as far as man is concerned, include not only the seven cervical
vertebrae, but also the upper seven dorsal vertebrae, being those to
which the true ribs are attached. It is worth remarking, however, that
in large birds such as the eagle, the neck itself consists of fourteen
vertebrae.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[163:2](sbe44052.htm#fr_482.md) The St. Petersb.
Dict. takes '*g*atru' in the sense of 'tuberculae costarum,' or
tubercles of the ribs, the projections near the 'heads' of the ribs
where these join the spinal vertebrae; this conjectural meaning being
based on VIII, 6, 2, 10, where the ribs are said to be fastened on both
sides to the kîkasâ*h* (? sternum) and the *g*atrava*h*. Against this
conjecture (as the Dict. remarks) is the circumstance that the
*g*atrava*h* are here said to form part of the chest; and, besides, the
tubercle of the rib is not a separate bone, and would hardly be likely
to be specially singled out in this <span id="page_164">p. 164</span>
connection. Perhaps, therefore, the *g*atrava*h* may rather be the
costal cartilages connecting the seven true ribs with the sternum, and
along with them the ligament of the collar-bone where it joins the
sternum; in which case the former passage would have to be understood in
the sense that the ribs are on both (the right and left) sides fastened
on to the costal cartilages and (through them) to the 'kîkasâ*h*,' the
breast-bone, or rather the several bones or plates of which the sternum
consists, as articulated with the clavicles and the true ribs. It is
possible, however, that 'kîkasâ*h*' may have a different meaning from
that here assigned to it, in acc. with the St. Petersb. Dict. Indeed,
one would expect the 'kîkasâ*h*' and '*g*atrava*h*' on different ends of
the ribs.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[164:1](sbe44052.htm#fr_483.md) The meaning of
'kuntâpa' is likewise doubtful. The St. Petersb. Dict. suggests that
certain glands may he intended thereby; but possibly the term may refer
to the transverse processes (forming spikes, so to speak; cf. kunta) on
both sides of the ten lower spinal vertebrae below the vertebra of the
last true rib,--i.e. of the five lower dorsal, and the five lumbar
vertebrae.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[164:2](sbe44052.htm#fr_484.md) The clavicle, or
collar-bone, would thus seem to be classed along with the ribs. Rather
peculiar, in the anatomical phraseology employed in the Brâhma*n*a, is
the collateral use of 'par*s*u' and 'p*ri*sh*t*i' for 'rib'; and it is
by no means clear that there is no distinction between the two terms. In
connection with the Reta*h*si*k* bricks the term 'p*ri*sh*t*i' seems to
be invariably used,--cf. VIII, 6, 2, 7, as against ib. paragraph 10
(par*s*u).

<span id="fn_485"></span>[165:1](sbe44052.htm#fr_485.md) This is another
term, the exact meaning of which is somewhat doubtful. The St. Petersb.
Dict. takes 'karûkara' to refer to the vertebrae of the spinal column;
and if that be correct, the term would seem to include not only the
twenty-four joints of the backbone down to the last lumbar vertebrae,
but also the appendages of the spine, viz. the sacrum with its five, and
the coccyx with its four pieces: this, it is true, yields thirty-three,
instead of thirty-two, parts, but it seems scarcely possible in any
other way--as, for instance, by taking into account the epiphysial
plates between the vertebrae, along with the latter--to arrive at a
total approximating that mentioned in the above passage.
