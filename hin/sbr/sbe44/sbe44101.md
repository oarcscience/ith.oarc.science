### EIGHTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### EXPIATORY OFFERINGS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:8:1">13:3:8:1</span></span>1. Now,
then, of the expiations. If the sacrificial horse were to couple with a
mare, let him in addition prepare a milk (oblation) to Vâyu;--Vâyu
doubtless is the transformer of seeds, for Vâyu (the wind) is the vital
air, and the vital air is the transformer

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

of seeds: by means of seed he thus puts seed into it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:8:2">13:3:8:2</span></span>2. And
if disease were to befal it, let him in addition prepare a pap to
Pûshan, for Pûshan rules over beasts (cattle); and, indeed, he thereby
gratifies him who owns cattle and rules over cattle; and it (the horse)
thereby indeed becomes free from disease.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:8:3">13:3:8:3</span></span>3. And
if sickness without (visible) injury <span
id="fr_887"></span>[1](#fn_883) were to befal it, let him in addition
prepare for (Agni) Vai*s*vânara a cake on twelve potsherds, with the
earth serving for potsherds <span id="fr_888"></span>[2](#fn_884); for
Vai*s*vânara is this (earth): he thereby gratifies this (earth), and it
(the horse) becomes free from disease.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:8:4">13:3:8:4</span></span>4. And
if an eye-disease were to befal it, let him in addition prepare a pap to
Sûrya;--the Sun, doubtless, is the eye of creatures, for when he rises
everything here moves: by means of the eye (of the world) he thus
bestows the eye upon it. And as to why it is a pap (*k*aru), it is
because by means of the eye this self (body or mind) moves (*k*ar).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:8:5">13:3:8:5</span></span>5. And
if it were to die in water, let him in addition prepare a barley pap to
Varu*n*a, for Varu*n*a seizes him who dies in water: he thereby thus
gratifies that very deity who seizes it, and, thus gratified, he
approves his slaughtering another (horse), and he slaughters it as one
approved by that (deity). And as to why it is (prepared) of barley, it
is because barley belongs to Varu*n*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:8:6">13:3:8:6</span></span>6. And
if it were to get lost, let him in addition

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

perform an ish*t*i with three sacrificial dishes--a cake on one potsherd
for Heaven and Earth, a milk (oblation) for Vâyu, and a pap for
Sûrya;--for whatsoever is lost, is lost within heaven and earth; and the
wind blows upon it, and the sun shines upon it; and nothing whatever is
lost out of (the reach of) these deities. And even by itself <span
id="fr_889"></span>[1](#fn_885) this (ish*t*i) is the recoverer of what
is lost; and even if any other thing of his were to get lost let him
perform this very offering, and he verily finds it. And if enemies were
to obtain the horse, or if it were to die (either in any other way) or
in water <span id="fr_890"></span>[2](#fn_886), let them bring another
(horse) and consecrate it by sprinkling: this, indeed, is the expiation
in that case.
