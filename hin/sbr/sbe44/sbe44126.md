### ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS.

Page 13, paragraphs 7, 8. We have probably to translate--the gods were
created on its reaching heaven,--they were created on its entering this
earth.

P. 45, par. 33, lines 6, 11. Read,--in the balance.

P. 60, l. 19. Read,--Adhvaryu.

P. 109, note 3. Add,--Cf. also Hillebrandt, 'Varu*n*a and Mitra,' p. 68
seq.

P. 130, par. 9, ll. 2, 3. Read,.--'The divine thought protect thee, not
man's thought!'

P. 136, par. 6, l. 2. Under him:--Harisvâmin explains 'anu' by
'anvâbhakta,' 'participating after him,' cf. [XIII, 5, 4,
24](sbe44109.htm#13:5:4:24.md).

P. 149, note 1. The commentary takes 'p*ri*sh*th*yapratish*th*ite' in
the sense of 'established on the p*ri*sh*th*ya,'--inasmuch as, in the
first half of the year, he begins each month with the Abhiplava, and
ends with the P*ri*sh*th*ya, which is the stronger (balavattara, cf.
[XII, 2, 2, 16](sbe44050.htm#12:2:2:16).md), and therefore
'âtmapratish*th*ita.'

P. 155, note 2. The MS. of the commentary is corrupt--âṅ-pûrvasyâkriyate
satari*n*âdaya*h* *s*a*h* bhadrâgamam va*kkh*asthâne evâdhikshipayati na
prade*s*ântara âvartata ity artha*h*.

stability in the air!' for by the Sâkvara and Raivata sâmans it is
indeed established in the air.

P. 108, l. 8. Read,--Pûrva*k*itti.

P. 163, l. 3. Read,--of seven seasons.

P 352, par. 23, l. 2. Read,--thousand B*ri*hatîs.

P. 389, l. 9. Perhaps we ought to translate--that (gold man), indeed, is
the end, the self, of everything here (or, of this universe). Cf. J.
Muir, Orig. Sansk. Texts, vol. v, p. 389.

Par. 16, l. 2. Read,--they ascend to where desires have vanished.

P. 393, par. 1, l. 4. Read,--*G*ana *S*ârkarâkshya.
