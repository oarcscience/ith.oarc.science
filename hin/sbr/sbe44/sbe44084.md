### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE SECOND SOMA-DAY (UKTHYA).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:1">13:2:2:1</span></span>1.
Verily, this--to wit, the A*s*vamedha--is the king of sacrifices. But,
indeed, the A*s*vamedha is the Sacrificer, (for) the sacrifice is the
Sacrificer: when he (the priest) binds victims to the horse (or, at the
horse-sacrifice), he then, indeed, takes hold <span
id="fr_756"></span>[3](#fn_752.md) of the sacrifice at the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:2">13:2:2:2</span></span>2. 'A
horse, a hornless he-goat, and a Gom*ri*ga <span
id="fr_757"></span>[4](#fn_753.md)'

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

these they bind to the central stake: thereby, indeed, he (the priest)
sharpens the front of his (the Sacrificer's) army <span
id="fr_758"></span>[1](#fn_754.md), whence the front of the king's army is
sure to become terrible.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:3">13:2:2:3</span></span>3. A
black-necked (he-goat), sacred to Agni, in front (of the horse) to its
forehead <span id="fr_759"></span>[2](#fn_755): the original (hall.md) fire
he makes it, whence the king's hall-fire is sure to be (efficient) <span
id="fr_760"></span>[3](#fn_756.md).

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:4">13:2:2:4</span></span>4. An
ewe, for Sarasvatî, beneath the (horse's) jaws: he thereby makes women
to be dependent, whence women are sure to be attendant upon man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:5">13:2:2:5</span></span>5. Two
(he-goats), black on the lower part of the body <span
id="fr_761"></span>[1](#fn_757), for the A*s*vins, (he ties.md) to the
front legs: he thereby lays strength into the front legs, whence the
king is sure to be strong in the arm <span
id="fr_762"></span>[2](#fn_758.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:6">13:2:2:6</span></span>6. A
dark-grey (he-goat) for Soma and Pûshan at the (horse's) navel: a
foothold he makes this one; for Pûshan is this (earth): it is thereon he
establishes himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:7">13:2:2:7</span></span>7. A
white one and a black one, for Sûrya and Yama, on the flanks: a suit of
armour he makes those two: whence the king, clad in mail, performs
heroic deeds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:8">13:2:2:8</span></span>8. Two,
with shaggy hind thighs, for Tvash*tri*, to the hind legs: he lays
strength into the thighs, whence the king is sure to be strong in his
thighs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:9">13:2:2:9</span></span>9. A
white one, for Vâyu, to the tail,--an elevation he makes this one,
whence people in danger betake themselves to an elevated place <span
id="fr_763"></span>[3](#fn_759.md);--a cow wont to cast her calf, for
Indra, the ever active, in order to associate the sacrifice with
Indra;--a dwarfish one for Vish*n*u; for Vish*n*u is the sacrifice: it
is in the sacrifice he (the Sacrificer) thus finally establishes
himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:10">13:2:2:10</span></span>10.
These, then, are the fifteen 'paryaṅgya' (body-encircling) <span
id="fr_764"></span>[4](#fn_760.md) animals,--for fifteenfold is the

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means manly vigour: with that
thunderbolt, manly vigour, the Sacrificer now repels evil from in
front <span id="fr_765"></span>[1](#fn_761) (of the sacrifice.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:11">13:2:2:11</span></span>11.
And fifteen (victims), indeed, are (bound) to each of the other
(stakes);--for fifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means
manly vigour: with that thunderbolt, manly vigour, the Sacrificer now
repels evil on both sides <span id="fr_766"></span>[2](#fn_762.md) (of the
sacrifice).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:12">13:2:2:12</span></span>12.
As to this they say, 'Does he really repel evil by these?' And, indeed,
he does not make up the complete Pra*g*âpati, and does not here gain
everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:13">13:2:2:13</span></span>13.
Let him rather bind seventeen animals to the central stake <span
id="fr_767"></span>[3](#fn_763.md); for seventeenfold is Pra*g*âpati, and
the A*s*vamedha is Pra*g*âpati,--thus for the

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

obtainment of the A*s*vamedha. And sixteen (victims he binds) to each of
the other (stakes), for of sixteen parts (kalâ) consists all this <span
id="fr_768"></span>[1](#fn_764) (universe); all this (universe.md) he thus
gains.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:14">13:2:2:14</span></span>14.
'How is he to appease <span id="fr_769"></span>[2](#fn_765.md) these?' they
ask. 'Let him appease them with the Bârhaduktha verses <span
id="fr_770"></span>[3](#fn_766.md), "Enkindled, anointing the lap of the
faithful(f.) . . .;" for B*ri*haduktha, the son of Vâmadeva, or A*s*va,
son of Samudra, saw these very (verses) to be the âprî-verses of the
horse: it is by means of these we appease it,' so they say. But let him
not do so; let him appease it with the *G*âmadagna verses; for
*G*amadagni is Pra*g*âpati, and so is the A*s*vamedha: he thus supplies
it with its own deity; let him therefore appease (the victims) with the
*G*âmadagna verses <span id="fr_771"></span>[4](#fn_767.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:15">13:2:2:15</span></span>15.
Now some make the invitatory-formulas and the offering-formulas (to be
pronounced) separately for the 'paryaṅgyas,' saying, 'For these we find
(formulas)--for the others, on account of not finding any, we do not use
them <span id="fr_772"></span>[5](#fn_768.md).' Let him not do so;

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

for the horse is the nobility (chieftain), and the other animals are the
peasantry (clan); and those who do this really make the peasantry equal
and refractory to the nobility; and they also deprive the Sacrificer of
his vital power. Therefore the horse alone belongs to Pra*g*âpati <span
id="fr_773"></span>[1](#fn_769.md), and the others are sacred to the gods:
he thus, indeed, makes the peasantry obedient and subservient to the
nobility; and he also supplies the Sacrificer with vital power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:16">13:2:2:16</span></span>16.
The slaughtering-knife of the horse is made of gold, those of the
'paryaṅgyas' of copper, and those of the others of iron; for gold is
(shining) light, and the A*s*vamedha is the royal office: he thus
bestows light upon the royal office. And by means of the golden light
(or, by the light of the gold), the Sacrificer also goes to the heavenly
world; and he, moreover, makes it a gleam of light shining after him,
for him to reach the heavenly world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:17">13:2:2:17</span></span>17.
But, indeed, the horse is also the nobility; and this also--to wit,
gold--is a form (symbol) of

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

the nobility: he thus combines the nobility with the nobility.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:18">13:2:2:18</span></span>18.
And as to why there are copper (knives) for the 'paryaṅgyas,'--even as
the non-royal kingmakers, the heralds and headmen, are to the king, so
those 'paryaṅgyas' are to the horse; and so, indeed, is this--to wit,
copper--to gold: with their own form he thus endows them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:2:19">13:2:2:19</span></span>19.
And as to why there are iron ones for the others,--the other animals,
indeed, are the peasantry, and this--to wit, iron--is a form of the
peasantry: he thus combines the peasantry with the peasantry. On a
rattan mat (lying) north (of the Âhavanîya) they cut the portions of the
horse(-flesh); for the horse is of anush*t*ubh nature, and related to
the Anush*t*ubh is that (northern) quarter: he thus places that (horse)
in its own quarter. And as to (his doing so) on a rattan mat,--the horse
was produced from the womb of the waters <span
id="fr_774"></span>[1](#fn_770.md), and the rattan springs from the water:
he thus causes it to be possessed of its own (maternal) womb.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_752"></span>[298:3](sbe44084.htm#fr_756.md) Ârabhate prâpnoti,
comm.; it might also be rendered by 'he enters upon the sacrifice.'

<span id="fn_753"></span>[298:4](sbe44084.htm#fr_757.md) This (and the
identical passage [XIII, 5, 1, 13](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:13).md) looks like a
quotation, as if quoted from Vâ*g*. S. XXIV, 1; where are <span
id="page_299">p. 299</span> likewise found the references to the other
victims and their places, in [paragraphs
2](sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:2)-[9](sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:9.md). Possibly, however,
the 'iti' may be used here with a kind of 'deiktic' force (cf. the
similar use in [XIII, 2, 8, 1](sbe44090.htm#13:2:8:1).md); if, indeed, it
does not simply refer to 'gom*ri*ga,' i.e. 'the animal called
Gom*ri*ga.' (lit. 'bovine deer'), regarding which see note on [XIII, 3,
4, 3](sbe44097.htm#13:3:4:3.md).--Though the victims to be immolated on
this day are first dealt with in this and the following Brâhma*n*as,
their slaughter only takes place at the usual time at every
Soma-sacrifice, viz. after the Sarpa*n*am ([XIII, 2, 3,
1](sbe44085.htm#13:2:3:1) seqq..md), the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna
Stotra, and the drawing of the Â*s*vina-graha. On the present occasion
these ceremonies are preceded by the drawing of the Mahiman cups of Soma
(see [XIII, 2, 11, 1](sbe44093.htm#13:2:11:1) seqq..md); whilst the chant
is followed by the driving up of the victims, and the putting to of the
horse, and the driving to the water, treated of in [XIII, 2, 6,
1](sbe44088.htm#13:2:6:1.md) seqq.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[299:1](sbe44084.htm#fr_758.md) Harisvâmin takes
this to mean that he makes the (sacrificial) horse, i.e. the king, alone
the head of the army,--râ*g*abhûtam apy a*s*va*m* senâmukham eka*m*
karotîty artha*h*.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[299:2](sbe44084.htm#fr_759.md) According to the
comments on Vâ*g*. S. XXIV, 1, and Kâty. XX, 6, 4, a rope is wound round
the horse's body in the same way as it is done with a bottle-gourd
(lagenaria vulgaris), and it is to this rope that these so-called
'paryaṅgyâh (circumcorporal),' or victims surrounding the (horse's)
body, would then be tied.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[299:3](sbe44084.htm#fr_760.md) The commentator
explains 'bhâvuka' by 'sâdhur bhavati;' and he adds that this is
important inasmuch as numerous magic rites, such as rites for insuring
success and averting evil (*s*ântikapaush*t*ika), and incantations
(âbhi*k*ârika) are performed thereon. It is the name here assigned to
this, the Âvasathya, fire, viz. 'pûrvâgni' or, original fire--with its
secondary meaning 'front-fire'--which is seized upon by the author for
symbolically identifying it with the victim fastened in front (or to the
front) of the horse.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[300:1](sbe44084.htm#fr_761.md) Mahîdhara takes
'adhorâma' to mean 'white-coloured on the lower part of the body.'

<span id="fn_758"></span>[300:2](sbe44084.htm#fr_762.md) The word 'bâhu'
means both 'arm' and 'front leg.'

<span id="fn_759"></span>[300:3](sbe44084.htm#fr_763.md) That is, a
mountain, a palace, high ground, &c., comm. ('vâyur hi
skandhasyo*kkh*rita ity abhiprâya*h*').

<span id="fn_760"></span>[300:4](sbe44084.htm#fr_764.md) Here the encircled
horse itself, and the other two victims <span id="page_301">p.
301</span> tied directly to the central stake, are improperly included
in the term 'paryaṅgya.'

<span id="fn_761"></span>[301:1](sbe44084.htm#fr_765.md) Viz. inasmuch as
the sacrificial stake to which the horse is tied (and hence the victims
fastened thereto) is the so-called 'agnish*th*a' stake, or the one
standing opposite to (directly in front of) the Âhavanîya fire.

<span id="fn_762"></span>[301:2](sbe44084.htm#fr_766.md) Viz. inasmuch as
these other stakes stand in a line to the north (left) and south (right)
of the central stake. Whilst, in the case of a simple 'ekâda*s*inî' (cf.
III, 7, 2, 1 seqq.) there would be five stakes on each side of the
central one, at the A*s*vamedha there are to be twenty-one stakes, or
ten on either side of the central stake. See [XIII, 4, 4,
5](sbe44105.htm#13:4:4:5.md) seqq.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[301:3](sbe44084.htm#fr_767.md) These seventeen
victims do not include the twelve paryaṅgyas which are tied to different
parts of the horse's body, but only to those which are actually tied to
the central stake,--viz. the horse and its two immediate neighbours
(paragraph 2), then twelve victims (enumerated Vâ*g*. S. XXIV, 2,
beginning with three victims of different shades of red, rohita), and
lastly two beasts belonging to two sets of eleven victims finally
superadded to the sets of fifteen victims tied in the first place to the
stakes. Cf. note on [XIII, 2, 5, 2](sbe44087.htm#13:2:5:2.md).

<span id="fn_764"></span>[302:1](sbe44084.htm#fr_768.md) Regarding this
division into sixteen parts, as applied to man, the animal, and the
universe, see Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 111 with note.

<span id="fn_765"></span>[302:2](sbe44084.htm#fr_769.md) Or, 'what Âprîs
(appeasing verses) is he to pronounce over them?' These verses are
pronounced as the offering-formulas (yâ*g*yâ) at the fore-offerings of
the animal sacrifice. See part ii, p. 185, note 1.

<span id="fn_766"></span>[302:3](sbe44084.htm#fr_770.md) Viz. Vâ*g*. S.
XXIX, 1-11.

<span id="fn_767"></span>[302:4](sbe44084.htm#fr_771.md) Viz. Vâ*g*. S.
XXIX, 25-36, beginning, 'Enkindled in the house of man this day, a god,
thou worshippest the gods, O *G*âtavedas.'

<span id="fn_768"></span>[302:5](sbe44084.htm#fr_772.md) The commentator
takes this to mean that, inasmuch as these paryaṅgyas--here improperly
including the horse itself and the two other victims of Pra*g*âpati at
the central stake--are assigned to commonly invoked deities, formulas
relating to these would easily <span id="page_303">p. 303</span> be
found; whilst in the case of the other twelve victims tied to the
central stake (see [p. 301](#page_301), note [3](#fn_763).md), as well as
those of the other stakes--though they, too, are assigned to definite
deities--some of their deities (as in the case of three a year and a
half old heifers assigned to Gâyatrî, Vâ*g*. S. XXIV, 21), are such as
to make it difficult to find suitable formulas for them:--eteshâm
a*s*vâdînâ*m* pra*g*âpatvâdikâ yâ*g*yânuvâkyâs tâ*h* kim iti na
p*ri*thak kurma*h*; itareshâ*m* rohitâdînâ*m* na vindâma*h*, tryavayo
gâyatryâdayo devatâs taddevatyâ*s* *k*a durlabhâ laksha*n*opetâ
yâ*g*yânuvâkyâ ity abhiprâya*h*.

<span id="fn_769"></span>[303:1](sbe44084.htm#fr_773.md) The
invitatory-formula and offering-formula are, however, pronounced once
for the 'paryaṅgyas' (including the horse) in common, whilst a second
pair of formulas are used for the other victims in common.

<span id="fn_770"></span>[304:1](sbe44084.htm#fr_774.md) See VI, 1, 1, 11
(V, 1, 4, 5).
