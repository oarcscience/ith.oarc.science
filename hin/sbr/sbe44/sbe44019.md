Verily, whosoever knows the six pairs in the Agnihotra, has offspring
born to him by pair after pair, by all generations. The Sacrificer and
his wife--this is one pair: through it his Agnihotra would be possessed
of a wife,--'May I obtain this pair!' he thinks <span

another pair: through it his Agnihotra-cow would become possessed of a
male calf,--'May I obtain this pair!' he thinks. The pot and the
coals--this is another pair; the offering-spoon and the
dipping-spoon--this is another pair; the Âhavanîya fire and the
log--this is another pair; the libation and the Svâhâ-call--this is
another pair: these, doubtless, are the six pairs in the Agnihotra; and
he who thus knows them, has offspring born to him by pair after pair, by
all generations.
