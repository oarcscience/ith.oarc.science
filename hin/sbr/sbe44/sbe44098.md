### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:5:1">13:3:5:1</span></span>1.
Verily, there are deaths <span id="fr_866"></span>[3](#fn_862) connected
with all the worlds; and were he not to offer oblations to them, Death
would get hold of him in every world:

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

when he offers oblations to the Deaths <span
id="fr_867"></span>[1](#fn_863), he wards off Death in every world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:5:2">13:3:5:2</span></span>2.
Concerning this they say, 'If, in offering, he were to name them all,
saying, "To such <span id="fr_868"></span>[2](#fn_864) (a death) hail!
To such (a death) hail!" he would make that manifold death his
enemy <span id="fr_869"></span>[3](#fn_865), and would give himself over
to Death.' Only one oblation he offers to one of them, with, 'To Death,
hail!' for there is indeed but one Death in yonder world, even
Hunger <span id="fr_870"></span>[4](#fn_866): it is him he wards off in
yonder world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:5:3">13:3:5:3</span></span>3. A
second oblation he makes with, 'To Brahman-slaying, hail!' for,
doubtless, a murder other than the slaying of a Brahman is no murder;
but that--to wit, the slaying of a Brahman--is manifestly murder: he
thus manifestly wards off Death <span id="fr_871"></span>[5](#fn_867).

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:5:4">13:3:5:4</span></span>4.
Mu*nd*ibha Audanya <span id="fr_872"></span>[1](#fn_868) it was who
discovered this atonement for the slaying of a Brahman; and when one
offers the oblation to the Brahmahatyâ he prepares a remedy for the
slayer of a Brahman by satisfying Death himself with an oblation, and
making a protection <span id="fr_873"></span>[2](#fn_869) for him (the
slayer). At whosoever's A*s*vamedha, therefore, this oblation is
offered, even if in after-times <span id="fr_874"></span>[3](#fn_870)
any one in his family kills a Brahman, he thereby prepares a remedy
(expiation) for him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_862"></span>[339:3](sbe44098.htm#fr_866) That is, according
to Sâya*n*a, on Taitt. Br. III, 9, 15, 1, causes of death, such as
diseases, &c.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[340:1](sbe44098.htm#fr_867) The oblations
referred to in this Brâhma*n*a (§§ 1-4) occur towards the end of the
second set of 'ara*n*ye<sup>ऽ</sup>nû*k*ya' oblations mentioned above,
[p. 336](sbe44097.htm#page_336), note [2](sbe44097.htm#fn_856), where
the formulas are given. According to Taitt. Br., l.c., however, these
final oblations are to be performed--like that to *G*umbaka
(Varu*n*a)--at the time of the purificatory bath, which, indeed, may
also be intended by our Brâhma*n*a, though Kâtyâyana and Mahîdhara seem
to offer no indications to that effect. It is clear that these final
oblations must have formed the subject of considerable discussion among
the early ritualists.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[340:2](sbe44098.htm#fr_868) That is, according
to Sâya*n*a (Taitt. Br.), 'To death in the shape of disease, to death in
the shape of poverty, &c.' Harisvâmin, on our passage, has merely,
'Amushmai pit*ri*lokâya m*ri*tyave'--'To death (in the shape of) the
world of the Fathers,' which is not very clear.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[340:3](sbe44098.htm#fr_869) Or, perhaps, he
would make himself many a death-enemy (bahu*m* m*ri*tyum amitra*m*
kurvîta), the two nouns being taken as in apposition to each other; cf.
[p. 146](sbe44049.htm#page_146), note [1](sbe44049.htm#fn_441).

<span id="fn_866"></span>[340:4](sbe44098.htm#fr_870) See X, 6, 5, 1.

<span id="fn_867"></span>[340:5](sbe44098.htm#fr_871) Or, he thus wards
off what is manifestly Death (Death in person).

<span id="fn_868"></span>[341:1](sbe44098.htm#fr_872) That is, according
to Harisvâmin, the son of Udanya (Odana. St. Petersb. Dict.), Taitt. Br.
III, 9, 15, 3, has Mu*nd*ibha Audanyava (i.e. the son of Udanyu, Sây.)
instead. The Taitt. Br., besides, makes the crime to be expiated here to
be, not 'brahmahatyâ,' but 'bhrû*n*ahatyâ,' the killing of an embryo.
Sâya*n*a, however, there allows to 'bhrû*n*a' optionally its later
meaning of 'a Brâhma*n*a versed in the three Vedas and the sacrificial
art (kalpa),' and the Taitt. Br. itself, at all events, takes this
oblation to 'bhrû*n*ahatyâ' to atone likewise for the slaying of a
Brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_869"></span>[341:2](sbe44098.htm#fr_873) Harisvâmin
explains 'paripâ*n*am' by 'pari*s*ish*t*a*m* vânantam pânam' (?); whilst
Sâya*n*a, in Taitt. Br., takes it in the sense of 'sarvata*h* pâtram,'
i.e. having made the Sacrificer 'a thoroughly worthy person.'

<span id="fn_870"></span>[341:3](sbe44098.htm#fr_874) Harisvâmin here
unwarrantably takes 'aparîshû' in the sense of 'in past times.'
