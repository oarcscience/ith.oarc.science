### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:2:1">11:2:2:1</span></span>1. He
recites a gâyatrî invitatory formula <span
id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_132.md): the gâyatrî consisting of three feet,
these worlds being three in number <span
id="fr_133"></span>[2](#fn_133.md), it is these worlds the gods thereby
established.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:2:2">11:2:2:2</span></span>2. He
offers with a trish*t*ubh (verse): the trish*t*ubh consisting of four
feet, and cattle being four-footed, it is cattle the gods thereby
established in these established worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:2:3">11:2:2:3</span></span>3. The
Vasha*t*-call consists of two syllables (vausha*t*): man being
two-footed; it is two-footed man they thereby established among the
established cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:2:4">11:2:2:4</span></span>4.
Two-footed man, then, is established here among cattle. In like manner
this (Sacrificer) establishes thereby the worlds; and in the established
worlds he establishes cattle, and among the established cattle he
establishes himself: thus, indeed, is that man established among cattle,
who, knowing this, offers sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:2:5">11:2:2:5</span></span>5. And
when he offers, after the Vasha*t* has been uttered,--that Vasha*t*-call
being yonder shining (sun), and he being the same as Death <span
id="fr_134"></span>[3](#fn_134.md)--he thereby consecrates him (the
Sacrificer) after death, and causes him to be born from out of it, and
he is

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

delivered from that death. And the sacrifice, indeed, becomes his body:
thus, having become the sacrifice, he is delivered from that death, and
all his chief offerings are thereby delivered from that death <span
id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_135.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:2:6">11:2:2:6</span></span>6. And,
verily, whatever offering he there performs, that offering becomes his
body in yonder world; and when he who knows this departs this world then
that offering, being behind him, calls out to him, 'Come hither, here I
am, thy body;' and inasmuch as it calls out (invokes, âhvayati), it is
called 'âhuti' (offering or invocation).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_132"></span>[26:1](sbe44012.htm#fr_132.md) The anuvâkyâs
recited prior to the principal oblations (pradhâna-havis) are in the
gâyatrî metre; whilst the yâ*g*yâs (referred to in the next paragraph),
at the end of which the Vausha*t*! is uttered and the oblation poured
into the fire, consist of trish*t*ubh verses; cf. 1, 7, 2, 15.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[26:2](sbe44012.htm#fr_133.md) These inserted
clauses with 'vai' supply the reason for what follows, not for what
precedes, them.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[26:3](sbe44012.htm#fr_134.md) See X, 5, 1, 4.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[27:1](sbe44012.htm#fr_135.md) Viz. inasmuch as
the oblation is made with the Vasha*t*.
