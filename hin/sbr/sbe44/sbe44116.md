### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:4:1">13:8:4:1</span></span>1. They
now fix pegs round it <span id="fr_1165"></span>[3](#fn_1157),--a
Palâ*s*a (Butea frondosa) one in front,--for the Palâ*s*a is the Brahman
(n.): he thus makes him go to the heavenly world with the Brahman for
his leader;--a *S*amî (Prosopis spicigera) one on the left (north
corner), in order that there may be peace (*s*am) for him;--a Vara*n*a
(Crataeva Roxburghii) one behind, in order that he may ward off (vâraya)
sin from him;--

<span id="page_437">p. 437</span>

and a V*ri*tra-peg <span id="fr_1166"></span>[1](#fn_1158) on the right
(south corner) for sin not to pass beyond.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:4:2">13:8:4:2</span></span>2. On
the right (south) side they then dig two somewhat curved (furrows <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[2](#fn_1159)), and fill them with milk and
water,--these, indeed, are two inexhaustible streams (that) flow to him
in the other world;--and seven (they dig) on the left (north) side, and
fill them with water, for sin not to pass beyond, for indeed sin cannot
pass beyond seven rivers <span id="fr_1168"></span>[3](#fn_1160).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:4:3">13:8:4:3</span></span>3.
They <span id="fr_1169"></span>[4](#fn_1161) throw three stones each
(into the northern furrows), and pass over them, with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXV,
10; *Ri*g-v. X, 53, 8): 'Here floweth the stony one: hold on to each
other, rise, and cross over, ye friends: here will we leave behind what
unkind spirits there be, and will cross over to auspicious
nourishments;'--as the text so its import.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:4:4">13:8:4:4</span></span>4. They
cleanse themselves with Apâmârga plants <span
id="fr_1170"></span>[5](#fn_1162)--they thereby wipe away (apa-marg)
sin--

<span id="page_438">p. 438</span>

with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 11), 'O Apâmârga, drive thou away from us sin,
away guilt, away witchery, away infirmity, away evil dreams!'--as the
text so its import.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:4:5">13:8:4:5</span></span>5. They
bathe at any place where there is water. With (Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 12), 'May
the waters and plants be friendly unto us!' he takes water with his
joined hands,--for water is a thunderbolt: with the thunderbolt he thus
makes friendship,--and with, 'Unfriendly may they be unto him who hateth
us, and whom we hate!' he throws it in the direction in which he who is
hateful to him may be, and thereby overthrows him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:4:6">13:8:4:6</span></span>6. And
if it be standing water, it makes their (the bathers’) evil stop; and if
it flows, it carries away their evil. Having bathed, and put on garments
that have never yet been washed, they hold on to the tail of an ox <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[1](#fn_1163), and return (to their home),--for the
ox is of Agni's nature: headed by Agni they thus return from the world
of the Fathers to the world of the living. And Agni, indeed, is he who
leads one over the paths (one has to travel), and it is he who leads
these over.

<span id="page_439">p. 439</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:4:7">13:8:4:7</span></span>7. They
proceed (towards the village) muttering this verse (Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 14),
'From out of the gloom have we risen <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[1](#fn_1164) . . .'--from the gloom, the world of
the Fathers, they now indeed approach the light, the sun. When they have
arrived, ointments for the eyes and the feet are given them: such,
indeed, are human means of embellishment, and therewith they keep off
death from themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:4:8">13:8:4:8</span></span>8.
Then, in the house, having made up the (domestic) fire, and laid
enclosing-sticks of Vara*n*a wood round it, he offers, by means of a
sruva-spoon of Vara*n*a wood, an oblation to Agni Âyushmat <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[2](#fn_1165), for Agni Âyushmat rules over vital
power: it is of him he asks vital power for these (the Sacrificer's
family). \[Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 16,\] 'Thou, Agni, causest vital powers to
flow: (send us food and drink, and keep calamity. far from us),' serves
as invitatory formula.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:4:9">13:8:4:9</span></span>9. He
then offers, with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 17), 'Long-lived be thou, O Agni,
growing by offering, ghee-mouthed, ghee-born: drinking the sweet,
pleasant cow's ghee, guard thou these, as a father does his son, hail!'
he thus says this so that he (Agni) may guard and protect these (men).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:4:10">13:8:4:10</span></span>10.
The sacrificial fee for this (ceremony) consists of an old ox, old
barley, an old arm-chair with head-cushion--this at least is the
prescribed Dakshi*n*â, but he may give more according to his
inclination. Such, indeed, (is the performance) in the case of one who
had built a fire-altar.

<span id="page_440">p. 440</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:4:11">13:8:4:11</span></span>11.
And in the case of one who has not built a fire-altar, there is the same
mode of selecting the site (for the sepulchral mound) and the same
performance save that of the fire-altar. 'Let him use pebbles (instead
of bricks <span id="fr_1174"></span>[1](#fn_1166)) in the case of one
who keeps up a sacrificial fire,' say some, 'they are just what those
pebbles used at the Agnyâdheya are <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[2](#fn_1167).' 'Let him not use them,' say others;
'surely they would be liable to weigh heavily upon one who has not built
a fire-altar.' Let him do as he pleases.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:4:12">13:8:4:12</span></span>12.
Having fetched a clod from the boundary, he <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[3](#fn_1168) deposits it (midway) between (the
grave and the village), with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 15), 'This I put up as a
bulwark for the living, lest another of them should go unto that thing:
may they live for a hundred plentiful harvests, and shut out death from
themselves by a mountain!'--he thus makes this a boundary between the
Fathers and the living, so as not to commingle; and therefore, indeed,
the living and the Fathers are not seen together here.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1157"></span>[436:3](sbe44116.htm#fr_1165) According to
Kâty. Sr. XXI, the pegs are driven in immediately after the measuring,
and prior to the sweeping, of the site of the tumulus; and this must
certainly be the case, seeing that the cords by which the site is
enclosed ([XIII, 8, 1, 19](sbe44113.htm#13:8:1:19)) are fastened to the
pegs.

<span id="fn_1158"></span>[437:1](sbe44116.htm#fr_1166) The exact
meaning of 'v*ri*tra-*s*aṅku' is doubtful. Kâty. *S*r. XXI, 3, 31 has
'deha-*s*aṅku' instead, to which the commentary assigns the rather
improbable meaning of 'stone-pillar,' in favour of which he refers to
IV, 2, 5, 15 of our Brâhma*n*a--'Soma, in truth, was V*ri*tra: the
mountains and stones are his body; 'whence he makes 'v*ri*tra' =
'a*s*man' (stone).

<span id="fn_1159"></span>[437:2](sbe44116.htm#fr_1167) Or narrow
trenches or ditches--ku*t*ile karshû, Kâty. XXI, 4, 20. They are
apparently semicircular, probably with their open part towards the
grave.

<span id="fn_1160"></span>[437:3](sbe44116.htm#fr_1168) These seven
furrows are straight, running from west to east; thus separating the
grave from the north, the world of men.

<span id="fn_1161"></span>[437:4](sbe44116.htm#fr_1169) That is, the
Adhvaryu and the members of the Sacrificer's family.

<span id="fn_1162"></span>[437:5](sbe44116.htm#fr_1170) Lit.
'cleansing-plants' or 'wiping-plants,' Achyranthes aspera; also called
the burr-plant (Birdwood), a common hairy weed found all over India, and
much used for incantations and sacrificial purposes.

<span id="fn_1163"></span>[438:1](sbe44116.htm#fr_1171) That is to say,
one of them takes hold of the tail, whilst the others follow in single
file, each holding on to the one walking in front of him. Prof. Weber,
Ind. Stud. IX, p. 21, note, refers to the somewhat analogous practice of
tying to the left arm of a dead man the tail of the anustara*n*î-cow
slain at the funeral sacrifice, whereby the deceased is supposed to be
led safely--across the river Vaitara*n*î (Styx); see Sây. on Sha*d*v.
Br., as quoted Ind. Stud. I, p. 39; cf. also Colebrooke, Misc. Essays,
second ed., p. 192--to the world of the Fathers. According to Katy. XXI,
4, 24 the ceremony of taking hold of the tail is performed with the
verse, Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 53, 'For our well-being we hold on to the ox,
sprung from Surabhi: even as Indra to the gods, so be thou a saving
leader unto us!'

<span id="fn_1164"></span>[439:1](sbe44116.htm#fr_1172) See [XII, 9, 2,
8](sbe44072.htm#12:9:2:8).

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[439:2](sbe44116.htm#fr_1173) I.e. imbued with
vital power, long-lived.

<span id="fn_1166"></span>[440:1](sbe44116.htm#fr_1174) See [XIII, 8, 3,
6](sbe44115.htm#13:8:3:6).

<span id="fn_1167"></span>[440:2](sbe44116.htm#fr_1175) See II, 1, 1, 8
seqq.

<span id="fn_1168"></span>[440:3](sbe44116.htm#fr_1176) Viz. the
Adhvaryu, according to Mahîdhara on Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 15. According to
Katy. XXI, 4, 25, this ceremony takes place whilst they are on their way
back from the grave to the village; as indeed appears from the order in
which the formula used appears in the Vâ*g*. Sa*m*hitâ. It is difficult
to see why the author should not have given it in its right place,
unless it was done with a view to a good conclusion to the Kâ*nd*a, or
because he really wished it to he done after the performance of the
offering. It is scarcely necessary to assume that this Ka*nd*ikâ is a
later addition, perhaps based on the Kâ*n*va recension.
