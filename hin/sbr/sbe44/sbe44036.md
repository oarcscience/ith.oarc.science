### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:3:1">11:6:3:1</span></span>1.
*G*anaka of Videha performed a sacrifice accompanied with numerous gifts
to the priests. Setting apart a thousand cows, he said, 'He who is the
most learned in sacred writ amongst you, O Brâhma*n*as, shall drive away
these (cows) <span id="fr_355"></span>[1](#fn_355.md)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:3:2">11:6:3:2</span></span>2.
Yâ*gñ*avalkya then said, 'This way (drive) them!' They said, 'Art thou
really the most learned in sacred writ amongst us, Yâ*gñ*avalkya?' He
replied, 'Reverence be to him who is most learned in sacred writ! We are
but hankering after cows <span id="fr_356"></span>[2](#fn_356.md)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:3:3">11:6:3:3</span></span>3. They
then said (to one another), 'Which of us shall question him?' The shrewd
*S*âkalya said, 'I!' When he (Yâ*gñ*avalkya) saw him, he said, 'Have the
Brâhma*n*as made of thee a thing for quenching the firebrand,
*S*âkalya?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:3:4">11:6:3:4</span></span>4. He
said <span id="fr_357"></span>[3](#fn_357.md), 'How many gods are there,
Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'--'Three hundred and three, and three thousand and
three,' he replied.--'Yea, so it is!' he said. 'How many gods are there
really, Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'--'Thirty-three.'--'Yea, so it is!' he said.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'How many gods are
there really, Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'--'Three.'--'Yea, so it is!' he said. 'How
many gods are there really, Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'--'Two.'--'Yea, so it is!' he
said. 'How many gods are there really, Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'--'One and a
half.'--'Yea, so it is!' he said. 'How many gods are there really,
Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'--'One.'--'Yea, so it is!' he said. 'Who are those three
hundred and three, and three thousand and three?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:3:5">11:6:3:5</span></span>5. He
replied, 'These are their powers, but thirty-three gods indeed there
are.'--'Who are those thirty-three? Eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, and
twelve Âdityas,--that makes thirty-one; and Indra and Pra*g*âpati make
up the thirty-three.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:3:6">11:6:3:6</span></span>6. 'Who
are the Vasus?'--'Agni, the Earth, Vâyu (the wind), the Air, Âditya (the
sun), Heaven, the Moon, and the Stars:--these are the Vasus, for these
cause all this (universe) to abide (vas), and hence they are the Vasus.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:3:7">11:6:3:7</span></span>7. 'Who
are the Rudras?'--'These ten vital airs in man, and the self (spirit) is
the eleventh: when these depart from this mortal body, they cause
wailing (rud), and hence they are the Rudras.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:3:8">11:6:3:8</span></span>8. 'Who
are the Âdityas?'--'The twelve months of the year: these are the
Âdityas, for they pass whilst laying hold on everything here; and
inasmuch as they pass whilst laying hold (â-dâ) on everything here, they
are the Âdityas.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:3:9">11:6:3:9</span></span>9. 'Who
is Indra, and who Pra*g*âpati?'--'Indra, indeed, is thunder <span
id="fr_358"></span>[1](#fn_358.md), and Pra*g*âpati the sacrifice.'--'What
is thunder?'--'The thunderbolt.'--'What is the sacrifice?'--'Cattle.'

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:3:10">11:6:3:10</span></span>10.
'Who are those three gods?'--'These three worlds, for therein all the
gods are contained.'--'Who are those two gods?'--'Food and breath.
(life).'--'Who is the one and a half?'--'He who is blowing here <span
id="fr_359"></span>[1](#fn_359) (Vâyu, the wind.md).'--'Who is the one
god?'--'Breath.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:3:11">11:6:3:11</span></span>11.
He (Yâ*gñ*avalkya) said, 'Thou hast gone on questioning me beyond the
deity <span id="fr_360"></span>[2](#fn_360.md), beyond which there must be
no questioning: thou shalt die ere such and such a day, and not even thy
bones shall reach thy home!' And so, indeed, did he (*S*âkalya) die; and
robbers carried off his bones <span id="fr_361"></span>[3](#fn_361.md),
taking them for something else <span id="fr_362"></span>[4](#fn_362.md).
Wherefore let no man decry <span id="fr_363"></span>[5](#fn_363.md) any
one, for even (by) knowing this, he gets the better of him <span
id="fr_364"></span>[6](#fn_364.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_355"></span>[115:1](sbe44036.htm#fr_355.md) One might also
construe,--These are yours, O Brâhma*n*as: he who is the most learned in
sacred writ shall drive (them) away. Cf. Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, pp.
251, 363.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[115:2](sbe44036.htm#fr_356.md) Gokâmâ eva
kevala*m* vaya*m* sma*h* bhavâma*h*, Sây.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[115:3](sbe44036.htm#fr_357.md) See XIV, 6, 9, 1
seqq (There is no such location--JBH).

<span id="fn_358"></span>[116:1](sbe44036.htm#fr_358.md) Sâya*n*a takes
'stanayitnu' in the sense of 'thunder-cloud,'--stanayitnu*h*
stanana*s*îlo gar*g*an par*g*anya ity artha*h*.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[117:1](sbe44036.htm#fr_359.md) XIV, 6, 9, 10, the
use of 'adhyardha (having one half over)' in connection with the wind is
accounted for by a fanciful etymology, viz. because the wind succeeds
(or prevails) over (adhy-ardh) everything here.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[117:2](sbe44036.htm#fr_360.md) That is, as would
seem, Pra*g*âpati, cf. XIV, 6, 6, 1 (There is no such location--JBH),
where Yâ*gñ*avalkya tells Gârgî how one world is 'woven and rewoven' on
another, the last being that of Pra*g*âpati, which was woven on that of
the Brahman; and when Gârgî asks him as to what world the Brahman-world
was woven on, he gives the same reply as here, viz. that there must be
no questioning beyond that deity (Pra*g*âpati).

<span id="fn_361"></span>[117:3](sbe44036.htm#fr_361.md) Prof. Weber, Ind.
Streifen, I, p. 23, connects this feature with the belief in a strictly
personal existence after death prevailing at the time of the Brâhma*n*a,
which involved, as a matter of great moment, the careful collection of
the bones after the corpse had been burnt, with a view to their being
placed in an earthen vessel and buried.--Cf. Â*s*val. G*ri*hyas. IV, 5,
1 seqq.; Kâty. *S*r. XXI, 3, 7 seqq. See also J. Muir, Orig. Sanskrit
Texts, vol. v, p. 316.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[117:4](sbe44036.htm#fr_362.md) That is, mistaking
them for gold or some other valuable substance, comm.,--anyan
manyamânâ*h* suvar*n*âdidravyatvena *g*ânanta*h*.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[117:5](sbe44036.htm#fr_363.md) Or, 'revile,' as
the St. Petersb. Dict. takes it. Possibly, however, 'upa-vad' has here
the sense of 'to speak to,' i.e. 'to question or lecture some one.'

<span id="fn_364"></span>[117:6](sbe44036.htm#fr_364.md) The commentary is
partly corrupt and not very intelligible:--<span id="page_118">p.
118</span> Yasmâd eva*m* tasmâd iti goshu kathârûpe*n*a
tattvanik*ri*(ti)m upetya vâdî na bhavet, sva (? svayam) api tu
eva*m*vit paro bhavati, uktaprakâre*n*a ya*h* prâ*n*asvarûpa*m* *g*ânâti
ta*m* vidvâ*m*sam upetya tâtparye*n*â savâ (? âtmanâ) yukto bhaved ity
artha*h*, Sây. Cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. V, p. 36.1, note.--Prof. Delbrück,
Altind. Syntax, p. 528, takes 'paro bhavati' in the sense of 'he becomes
one of the other side, or shore,' i.e. he dies.
