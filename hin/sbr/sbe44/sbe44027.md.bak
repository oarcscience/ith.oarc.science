### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:3:1">11:5:3:1</span></span>1.
*S*au*k*eya Prâ*k*înayogya came to Uddâlaka Âru*n*i for a disputation on
spiritual matters <span id="fr_268"></span>[3](#fn_268.md), thinking, 'I
desire to know the Agnihotra.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:3:2">11:5:3:2</span></span>2. He
said, 'Gautama, what like is thy Agnihotra cow? what like the calf? what
like the cow joined by the calf? what like their meeting? what like (the
milk) when being milked? what like when it has been milked? what like
when brought (from the stable)? what like when put on the fire? what
like when the light is thrown on it <span
id="fr_269"></span>[4](#fn_269.md); what like when water is poured thereto?
what like when being taken off (the fire)? what like when taken off?
what like when

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

being ladled out <span id="fr_270"></span>[1](#fn_270.md)? what like when
ladled out? what like when lifted up (to be taken to the Âhavanîya)?
what like when being taken there? what like when held down <span
id="fr_271"></span>[2](#fn_271.md)?

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:3:3">11:5:3:3</span></span>3.
'What like is the log thou puttest on? what like the first libation? why
didst thou put it down (on the Vedi <span
id="fr_272"></span>[3](#fn_272).md)? why didst thou look away (towards the
Gârhapatya <span id="fr_273"></span>[4](#fn_273).md)? what like is the
second libation?

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:3:4">11:5:3:4</span></span>4.
'Why, having offered, dost thou shake it (the spoon)? why, having
cleansed the spoon all round (the spout), didst thou wipe it on the
grass-bunch? why, having cleansed it a second time all over, didst thou
place thy hand on the south (part of the Vedi)? why didst thou eat (of
the milk) the first time, and why the second time? why, on creeping away
(from the Vedi), didst thou drink (water)? why, having poured water into
the spoon, didst thou sprinkle therewith? why didst thou sprinkle it
away a second time, and why a third time in that (northerly) direction?
why didst thou pour down water behind the Âhavanîya? why didst thou
bring (the offering) to a close? If thou hast offered the Agnihotra
knowing this, then it has indeed been offered by thee;

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

but if (thou hast offered it) not knowing this, then it has not been
offered by thee.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:3:5">11:5:3:5</span></span>5. He
(Uddâlaka) said, 'My Agnihotra cow is I*d*â, Manu's daughter <span
id="fr_274"></span>[1](#fn_274); my calf is of Vâyu's nature; the (cow.md)
joined by the calf is in conjunction therewith <span
id="fr_275"></span>[2](#fn_275.md); their meeting is the Virâ*g*; (the
milk) when being milked belongs to the A*s*vins, and when it has been
milked, to the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*; when brought (from the stable) it
belongs to Vâyu; when put on (the fire), to Agni; when the light is
thrown on it, it belongs to Indra and Agni; when water is poured thereto
it belongs to Varu*n*a; when being taken off (the fire), to Vâyu; when
it has been taken off, to Heaven and Earth; when being ladled out, to
the A*s*vins; when it has been ladled out, to the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*; when
lifted up, to Mahâdeva; when being taken (to the Âhavanîya), to Vâyu;
when held down, to Vish*n*u.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:3:6">11:5:3:6</span></span>6. 'And
the log I put on (the fire) is the resting-place of the libations; and
as to the first libation, I therewith gratified the gods; and when I
laid down (the spoon with the milk), that belongs to B*ri*haspati; and
when I looked away, then I joined together this and yonder world; and as
to the second libation, I thereby settled myself in the heavenly world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:3:7">11:5:3:7</span></span>7. 'And
when, having offered, I shake (the spoon), that belongs to Vâyu; and
when, having cleansed the spoon all round (the spout), I wiped it on the
grass-bunch, then I gratified the herbs and trees;

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

and when, having cleansed it a second time all over, I placed my hand on
the south (part of the altar-ground), then I gratified the Fathers <span
id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_276); and when I ate (of the milk.md) the first
time, then I gratified myself; and when (I ate) a second time, then I
gratified my offspring; and when, having crept away (from the
altar-ground), I drank (water), then I gratified the cattle; and when,
having poured water into the spoon, I sprinkled therewith, then I
gratified the snake-deities; and when (I sprinkled) a second time, then
(I gratified) the Gandharvas and Apsaras; and when, a third time, I
sprinkled it away in that (northerly) direction, then I opened the gate
of heaven; and when I poured down water behind the altar, then I
bestowed rain on this world; and when I brought (the sacrifice) to a
close, then I filled up whatever there is deficient in the
earth.'--'This much, then, reverend sir, we two (know) in common <span
id="fr_277"></span>[2](#fn_277),' said (*S*au*k*eya.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:3:8">11:5:3:8</span></span>8.
*S*au*k*eya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a question,
reverend sir.'--'Ask then, Prâ*k*înayogya!' he replied. He (*S*au*k*eya)
said, 'If, at the time when thy fires are taken out, and the sacrificial
vessels brought down, thou wert going to offer, and the offering-fire
were then to go out, dost thou know what danger there is in that case
for him who offers?' 'I know,' he replied; 'before long the eldest son
would die in the case of him who would

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

not know this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have prevailed.'--'What
is that knowledge, and what the atonement?' he asked.--'The breath of
the mouth has entered the upward breathing--such (is the knowledge); and
I should make the offering in the Gârhapatya fire--that would be the
atonement, and I should not be committing that sin.'--'This much, then,
reverend sir, we two (know) in common,' said (*S*au*k*eya).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:3:9">11:5:3:9</span></span>9.
*S*au*k*eya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a question,
reverend sir.'--'Ask then, Prâ*k*înayogya!' he replied. He said, 'If, at
that very time, the Gârhapatya fire were to go out, dost thou know what
danger there is in that case for him who offers? I know it,' he replied;
'before long the master of the house <span
id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_278.md) would die in the case of him who would
not know this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have prevailed.'--'What
is that knowledge, and what the atonement?' he asked.--'The upward
breathing has entered the breath of the mouth--this (is the knowledge);
and I would make the offering on the Âhavanîya--this would be the
atonement, and I should not be committing that sin.'--'This much, then,
reverend sir, we two (know) in common,' said (*S*au*k*eya).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:3:10">11:5:3:10</span></span>10.
*S*au*k*eya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a question,
reverend sir.'--'Ask then, Prâ*k*înayogya!' he replied. He said, 'If, at
that very time, the Anvâhâryapa*k*ana fire were to go out, dost thou
know what danger there is in that case for him who offers?'--'I know
it,' he replied; 'before long all the cattle would die in the case of
him who would

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

not know this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have prevailed.'--'What
is that knowledge, and what the atonement?' he asked.---'The
through-breathing has entered the upward breathing--this (is the
knowledge); and I would make the offering on the Gârhapatya fire--this
is the atonement; and I should not be committing that sin.'--'This much,
then, reverend sir, we two (know) in common,' said (*S*au*k*eya).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:3:11">11:5:3:11</span></span>11.
*S*au*k*eya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a question,
reverend sir.'--'Ask, then, Prâ*k*înayogya!' he replied. He said, 'If,
at that very time, all the fires were to go out, dost thou know what
danger there is in that case for him who offers?'--'I know it,' he
replied; 'before long the family would be without heirs in the case of
him who would not know this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have
prevailed.'--'What is that knowledge, and what the atonement?' he
asked.--'Having, without delay, churned out fire, and taken out an
offering-fire in whatever direction the wind might be blowing, I would
perform an offering to Vâyu (the wind): I would then know that my
Agnihotra would be successful, belonging as it would to all deities; for
all beings, indeed, pass over into the wind, and from out of the wind
they are again produced <span id="fr_279"></span>[1](#fn_279.md). This
would be the atonement, and I should not be committing that sin.'--'This
much, then, reverend sir, we two (know) in common,' said (*S*au*k*eya).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:3:12">11:5:3:12</span></span>12.
*S*au*k*eya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a question,
reverend sir.'--'Ask then, Prâ*k*înayogya!'

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

he replied. He said, 'If at that very time all the fires were to go out,
when there should be no wind blowing, dost thou know what danger there
would be for him who offers?'--'I know it,' he replied; 'unpleasant
things, indeed, he would see in this world, and unpleasant things in
yonder world, were he not to know this; but by dint of knowledge I
myself have prevailed.'--'What is that knowledge, and what the
atonement?' he asked.--'Having, without delay, churned out fire, and
taken out an offering-fire towards the east, and sat down behind it, I
myself would drink (the Agnihotra milk): I should then know that my
Agnihotra would be successful, belonging as it would to all deities, for
all beings, indeed, pass into the Brâhma*n*a <span
id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_280.md), and from the Brâhma*n*a they are again
produced. That would be the atonement; and I should not be committing
that sin.'--'And, verily, I did not know this,' said (*S*au*k*eya).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:3:13">11:5:3:13</span></span>13.
*S*au*k*eya, thus instructed, said, 'Here are logs for fuel: I will
become thy pupil, reverend sir.' He replied, 'If thou hadst not spoken
thus, thy head would have flown off <span
id="fr_281"></span>[2](#fn_281.md): come, enter as my pupil!'--'So be it,'
he said. He then initiated him, and taught him that pain-conquering
utterance, Truth: therefore let man speak naught but truth <span
id="fr_282"></span>[3](#fn_282.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_268"></span>[79:3](sbe44027.htm#fr_268.md) Sâya*n*a takes
'brahmodyam agnihotram' together, in the sense 'the sacred truth'
regarding (or, in the form of) the Agnihotra,--agnihotravishaya*m*
brahmodya*m* brahmatattvasya rûpa*m* pratipâdyate yena tad vividishâmi
tadvishaya*m* vedane*kkh*â*m* karishyâmîtyâdinâbhiprâye*n*âgata*h*.
Unless 'brahmodyam' could be taken as an adjective, I do not see how it
is possible to adopt Sâya*n*a's interpretation.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[79:4](sbe44027.htm#fr_269.md) For letting the
light of a burning straw fall on the milk to see whether it is done, see
II, 3, 1, 16.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[80:1](sbe44027.htm#fr_270.md) Viz. by the
dipping-spoon (sruva) into the ladle (agnihotrahavanî), see II, 3, 1,
17.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[80:2](sbe44027.htm#fr_271.md) Whilst taking the
oblation to the Âhavanîya, he holds the spoon level with his mouth,
except when he is in a line between the two fires, when for a moment he
lowers the spoon so as to be level with his navel.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[80:3](sbe44027.htm#fr_272.md) This refers to the
putting down of the spoon containing the milk on the grass-bunch prior
to the second libation; cf. II, 3, 1, 17. One might also translate,
'what is that (or does it mean) that thou didst put it down?'

<span id="fn_273"></span>[80:4](sbe44027.htm#fr_273.md) Thus
Sâya*n*a,--apaikshish*th*â*h* gârhapatasyaiksha*n*am k*ri*tavân asi.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[81:1](sbe44027.htm#fr_274.md) See the legend, I,
8, 1, 1 seqq.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[81:2](sbe44027.htm#fr_275.md) That is, according
to Sâya*n*a, 'the sky allied with Vâyu, the wind,'--vâyunâ
sa*m*s*ri*sh*t*â dyau*h*.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[82:1](sbe44027.htm#fr_276.md) The departed
ancestors are supposed to reside in the southern region.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[82:2](sbe44027.htm#fr_277.md) He bhagavann
Uddâlaka bhavatoktam etat sava (? saha) nâv âvayo*h* saha sahita*m*
samânam ekarûpam iti *S*au*k*eyo ha bhuktavân (? hy uktavân)
anyapra*s*na*m* dar*s*ayita*m* prastauti, Sau*k*eyo *gñ*apta iti, Sây.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[83:1](sbe44027.htm#fr_278.md) That is, the
Sacrificer himself.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[84:1](sbe44027.htm#fr_279.md) At the time of
dissolution (layakâle) they pass into the wind; and at the time of
creation (s*ri*sh*t*ikâle) they are again created, Sây.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[85:1](sbe44027.htm#fr_280.md) Viz. as the
representative of the Brahman, or world-spirit.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[85:2](sbe44027.htm#fr_281.md) Yadaiva*m*
nâvakshya*h* yadaivam a*gñ*âna*m* nâvishkaroshi to mûrdhâ vyapatishyat,
mûrdhâ(va)patana*m* sva*gñ*ânapraka*t*anenâtrabhavata*h* parih*ri*tam
iti, Sây.--Prof. Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 366, takes 'vi-pat' in the
sense of--(thy head would have) flown asunder, or burst; which is indeed
possible; cf. XI, 4, I, 9.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[85:3](sbe44027.htm#fr_282.md) Cf. F. Max Müller,
'India, what can it teach us?' p. 65 seqq.
