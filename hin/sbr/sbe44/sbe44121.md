### SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE BOILING OF THE GHARMA, AND THE. OFFERINGS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:1">14:2:1:1</span></span>1. He
now offers (the first of) the two Rauhi*n*a (cakes) <span
id="fr_1256"></span>[2](#fn_1248):--(Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 21.md), 'May the day

<span id="page_473">p. 473</span>

be pleased with its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!'
with this text both (cakes are offered) in the morning;--'May the night
be pleased with its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!'
with this text both (cakes are offered) in the evening.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:2">14:2:1:2</span></span>2. And
as to why he offers two Rauhi*n*a (cakes),--the two Rauhi*n*as doubtless
are Agni and Âditya (the sun), for by means of these two deities
sacrificers ascend (ruh) to heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:3">14:2:1:3</span></span>3. And,
indeed, the Rauhi*n*as are also day and night, and the Pravargya is the
sun: he thus encompasses yonder sun by the day and the night, whence he
is encompassed by the day and the night.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:4">14:2:1:4</span></span>4. And,
indeed, the Rauhi*n*as are also these two

<span id="page_474">p. 474</span>

worlds, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus encompasses yonder sun by
these two worlds, whence he is encompassed by these two worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:5">14:2:1:5</span></span>5. And,
indeed, the Rauhi*n*as are also the two eyes, and the Pravargya is the
head: he thus places the eye in the head.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:6">14:2:1:6</span></span>6. He
now takes a rope, with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 1), 'At the impulse of the
divine Savit*ri*, I take thee, with the arms of the A*s*vins, with the
hands of Pûshan: Aditi's <span id="fr_1257"></span>[1](#fn_1249.md) zone
thou art;'--the mystic import of this is the same as before <span
id="fr_1258"></span>[2](#fn_1250.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:7">14:2:1:7</span></span>7. He
then calls the cow, whilst stepping behind the Gârhapatya (Vâ*g*. S.
XXXVIII, 2), 'I*d*â, come hither! Aditi, come hither! Sarasvatî, come
hither!' for the cow is I*d*â, and the cow is Aditi, and the cow is
Sarasvatî. And he also calls her by her (real) name, with these
(formulas), 'N.N. <span id="fr_1259"></span>[3](#fn_1251.md), come hither!'
thus thrice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:8">14:2:1:8</span></span>8. When
she comes, he lays (the rope) round her (horns), with (Vâ*g*. S.
XXXVIII, 3), 'Aditi's zone thou art, Indrâ*n*î's head-band;'--for
Indrâ*n*î is Indra's beloved wife, and she has a most variegated
head-band: 'that thou art' he thereby means to say, and that he indeed
thereby makes it to be.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:9">14:2:1:9</span></span>9. He
then lets the calf to it (to suck), with, 'Pûshan thou art,'--Pûshan,
doubtless, is he that blows here (the wind), for that one supports <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[4](#fn_1252.md)

<span id="page_475">p. 475</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (push) all this
(universe); and the Pravargya also is that (wind): it is him he thus
pleases, and therefore he says, 'Pûshan thou art.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:10">14:2:1:10</span></span>10.
He then leads it (the calf) away <span id="fr_1261"></span>[1](#fn_1253.md)
with, 'Afford (milk) for the Gharma!' for the Gharma, doubtless, is that
fluid which this (cow) lets flow: he thus means to say thereby, 'Allow
her a share!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:11">14:2:1:11</span></span>11.
He then causes it to flow into the milking-bowl, with (Vâ*g*. S. XX
XVIII, 4), 'Flow for the A*s*vins!'--with regard to the A*s*vins he thus
says this, for it was the A*s*vins who restored the head of the
sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Flow for
the A*s*vins!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:12">14:2:1:12</span></span>12,
'Flow for Sarasvatî!'--Sarasvatî, doubtless, is Speech, and with speech
the A*s*vins then restored the head of the Sacrifice: it is those
(A*s*vins) he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Flow for Sarasvatî!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:13">14:2:1:13</span></span>13.
'Flow for Indra!'--for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, and it was
indeed by him who is the deity of the sacrifice that the A*s*vins then
restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases, and
therefore he says, 'Flow for Indra!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:14">14:2:1:14</span></span>14.
The (spilt) drops he then consecrates with, 'Hail, possessed of Indra!
hail, possessed of Indra!' for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: he
thus pleases him who is the deity of the sacrifice, and therefore he
says, 'Hail, possessed of Indra! hail, possessed of Indra!' Thrice he
says it, for threefold is the sacrifice. The call of 'hail!' he places
first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as
before.

<span id="page_476">p. 476</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:15">14:2:1:15</span></span>15.
He then touches her udder <span id="fr_1262"></span>[1](#fn_1254.md), with
(Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 5; *Ri*g-v. I, 164, 49), 'This ever-flowing,
grateful udder of thine,'--that is to say, 'This udder of thine placed
in secret <span id="fr_1263"></span>[2](#fn_1255.md);'--'treasure-giving,
wealth-granting, bountiful,'--that is to say, 'which is a giver of
treasures, a granter of wealth, and precious;'--'whereby thou furtherest
all desirable things,'--that is to say, 'whereby thou supportest all the
gods and all creatures;'--'O Sarasvatî, move that hither for us to
suck,'--Sarasvatî, doubtless, is Speech, and so is this (cow) which
yields the Gharma milk; and Speech is worship: thus he means to say,
'Grant us worship whereby we may please the gods.' He then steps up to
the site of the Gârhapatya with, 'I pass along the wide aerial
realm,'--the mystic import of this is the same as before <span
id="fr_1264"></span>[3](#fn_1256.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:16">14:2:1:16</span></span>16.
He then takes the two lifting-sticks <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[4](#fn_1257), with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 6.md), 'The
Gâyatrî metre thou art,--the Trish*t*ubh metre thou art,'--he thus takes
them with both the Gâyatrî and the Trish*t*ubh metres;--'with heaven and
earth I encompass thee,'--for the two lifting-sticks are indeed these
two, heaven and earth; and the

<span id="page_477">p. 477</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pravargya is the
sun: he thus encompasses yonder sun within these two, heaven and earth.
Thereupon (having lifted up the pot) he sweeps it clean with a branch of
reed grass: the mystic import of this is the same as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:17">14:2:1:17</span></span>17.
He then puts it on the 'supporting' tray <span
id="fr_1266"></span>[1](#fn_1258.md) with, 'By the air I support
thee,'--for the 'supporting' tray is the air, since everything here is
supported by the air; and the 'supporting' tray also is the belly, for
all food and drink here is supported (held) by the belly: therefore he
says, 'By the air I support thee.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:18">14:2:1:18</span></span>18.
He then pours in the goat's milk <span
id="fr_1267"></span>[2](#fn_1259); for that (Mahâvîra pot.md) when heated,
becomes glowing: he thus soothes it, and when soothed he pours the cow's
milk into it--

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:19">14:2:1:19</span></span>19.
With, 'O Indra and ye A*s*vins!'--for Indra is the deity of the
sacrifice, and he thus pleases him who is the deity of the sacrifice;
and 'Ye A*s*vins' he says, because the A*s*vins at that time restored
the head of the sacrifice, and it is them he thus pleases: therefore he
says, 'O Indra and ye A*s*vins!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:20">14:2:1:20</span></span>20.
'Of bees’ honey'--this is indeed honey;--'drink ye the Gharma (hot
draught),'--that is to say, drink ye the liquor;'--'ye true
ones,'--those (deities) are indeed true (vasu), for it is

<span id="page_478">p. 478</span>

they that maintain (vâsaya) all this (universe);--'worship ye, vâ*t*!'
thus this comes to be for him as if it were offered with the
Vasha*t*-call.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:21">14:2:1:21</span></span>21.
'Hail to Sûrya's ray, the rain-winner <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[1](#fn_1260.md)!'--for one of the sun's rays is called
'rain-winner,' whereby he supports all these creatures: it is that one
he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Hail to Sûrya's ray, the
rain-winner!' The call of hail he places first, and the deity last: the
significance of this is the same as before <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[2](#fn_1261.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:1:22">14:2:1:22</span></span>22.
And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya)
enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as
at the creation <span id="fr_1270"></span>[3](#fn_1262.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1248"></span>[472:2](sbe44121.htm#fr_1256.md) According to the
Sûtras and the Taitt. Âr., the southern cake <span id="page_473">p.
473</span> is offered at this juncture of the performance, whilst the
northern one is offered later on (see [XIV, 2, 2,
41](sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:41).md). For both cakes one and the same text is
used, viz. the first of the two here mentioned at the morning
performance, whilst the second is used at the afternoon performance. The
cakes, being one-kapâla ones (the two 'rauhi*n*ahavanî' ladles serving
as kapâlas), must be offered entire. Cf. Kâty. XXVI, 4, 14; 6, 18;
Âpast. XV, 10, 1; 11, 5; 12, 7; Taitt. Âr. IV, 10, 4. Though our
Brâhma*n*a expresses itself in a rather peculiar way, its statement,
here and at [XIV, 2, 2, 41](sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:41.md), is perhaps meant to
imply the same mode of procedure. If this is the case, the two
paragraphs would mean,--at this juncture of the two performances he
offers the two southern (northern, at [XIV, 2, 2,
41](sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:41).md) cakes,--the two cakes (the southern and the
northern one) of the morning performance requiring the first, and those
of the afternoon performance the second, text. It is not impossible,
however, that the author intends a different mode of procedure or wishes
to leave it purposely vague. If we were to read 'rauhi*n*am' for
'rauhi*n*au,' the text would be more in accordance with the practice
prescribed in the Sûtras. Cf. also Mahîdh. (on Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII,
21)--where read 'rauhi*n*au' instead of 'pravargyau'--who adopts the
procedure here explained.

<span id="fn_1249"></span>[474:1](sbe44121.htm#fr_1257.md) The edition
omits 'adityai,' and reads 'devebhyas' for 'devasya.'

<span id="fn_1250"></span>[474:2](sbe44121.htm#fr_1258.md) See I, 2, 4, 4;
3, 1, 15.

<span id="fn_1251"></span>[474:3](sbe44121.htm#fr_1259.md) As, for
instance, Dhavalî, or Gaṅgâ.

<span id="fn_1252"></span>[474:4](sbe44121.htm#fr_1260.md) Or nourishes,
makes grow, inasmuch as it brings about rain (Mahîdhara).

<span id="fn_1253"></span>[475:1](sbe44121.htm#fr_1261.md) Whilst the calf
is sucking, he secures the cow by tying together her hind legs.

<span id="fn_1254"></span>[476:1](sbe44121.htm#fr_1262.md) Or, one of the
teats (stanam); according to Mahîdhara, the part is used for the whole;
and the Kâ*n*va recension indeed reads 'stanân' (the teats); cf. Kâty,
XXVI, 5, 7, comm.

<span id="fn_1255"></span>[476:2](sbe44121.htm#fr_1263.md) The author
apparently derives '*s*a*s*aya' (? perennial, inexhaustible) from
'*s*î,' to lie, sleep, as does Mahîdhara.

<span id="fn_1256"></span>[476:3](sbe44121.htm#fr_1264.md) Viz. as at I, 1,
2, 4.--According to Kâty. XXVI, 5, 10 seq., the Hot*ri* says, 'Arise,
Brahma*n*aspati!' whereupon the Adhvaryu rises; and the Hot*ri* again
calling, 'Hasten up with the milk!' he steps up to the Gârhapatya.

<span id="fn_1257"></span>[476:4](sbe44121.htm#fr_1265.md) See [p.
458](sbe44118.htm#page_458), note [1](sbe44118.htm#fn_1211.md).

<span id="fn_1258"></span>[477:1](sbe44121.htm#fr_1266.md) The 'upayamanî'
is apparently a kind of bowl, or hollow tray of hard (udumbara) wood,
somewhat larger than the (bowls of the) spoons or ladles used on this
occasion, and, indeed, also itself used as such.

<span id="fn_1259"></span>[477:2](sbe44121.htm#fr_1267.md) Whilst the
Adhvaryu was milking the cow into the earthen bowl (pinvana), his
assistant, the Pratiprasthât*ri*, silently milked a goat tied to the
peg.

<span id="fn_1260"></span>[478:1](sbe44121.htm#fr_1268.md) According to
Taitt. Âr. IV, 8, 4; Âpast. XV, 10, 2, this formula is addressed to the
steam rising from the Mahâvîra pot--it being accordingly modified to 'I
offer thee to Sûrya's ray, the rain-winner.'

<span id="fn_1261"></span>[478:2](sbe44121.htm#fr_1269.md) [XIV, 1, 3,
26](sbe44119.htm#14:1:3:26.md).

<span id="fn_1262"></span>[478:3](sbe44121.htm#fr_1270.md) See [p.
458](sbe44118.htm#page_458), note [1](sbe44118.htm#fn_1211.md).
