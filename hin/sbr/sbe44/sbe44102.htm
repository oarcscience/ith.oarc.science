<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:1">13:4:1:1</A></FONT></span>1. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati desired, 'Would that I obtained all my desires! would that I attained all attainments!' He beheld this three days&#8217; Soma-sacrifice, the A<I>s</I>vamedha, and took possession of it, and sacrificed with it: by sacrificing therewith he obtained all his desires, and attained all attainments; and, verily, whosoever performs the A<I>s</I>vamedha sacrifice obtains all his desires, and attains all attainments.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:2">13:4:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. Concerning this they say, 'In what season is the beginning (to be made)?'--'Let him begin it in summer,' say some, 'for summer is the Kshatriya's season, and truly this--to wit, the A<I>s</I>vamedha--is the Kshatriya's sacrifice.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:3">13:4:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. But let him rather begin it in spring; for</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_348"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 348</FONT></A></p>  
<p>spring is the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a's season, and truly whosoever sacrifices, sacrifices after becoming, as it were, a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a: let him therefore by all means begin it in spring.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:4">13:4:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. And six days, or seven days, before that full-moon of Ph&acirc;lguna, the officiating priests meet together--to wit, the Adhvaryu, the Hot<I>ri</I>, the Brahman, and the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>; for under these&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_891"></A><A HREF="#fn_887"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the other priests are.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:5">13:4:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. The Adhvaryu prepares for them a priest's mess of rice sufficient for four persons: the meaning of this has been explained&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_892"></A><A HREF="#fn_888"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Four bowlfuls, four double handfuls, four handfuls: twelvefold this is--twelve months are a year, and the year is everything, and the A<I>s</I>vamedha is everything--thus it is in order to his gaining and securing everything.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:6">13:4:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. Those four priests eat it: the meaning of this has been explained. He (the Sacrificer) gives to them four thousand (cows) in order to his gaining and securing everything, for a thousand means everything, and the A<I>s</I>vamedha is everything. And (he gives them) four gold plates weighing a hundred (grains): the meaning of this has been explained&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_889"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:7">13:4:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. The Adhvaryu then, hanging a gold ornament (nishka) round him, makes him mutter (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXII, 1), 'Fire thou art, light and immortality,'--for gold, indeed, is fire, light&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and</p>

<p>immortality: fire (fiery mettle), light (brilliance), and immortality he thus bestows upon him;--'protector of life, protect my life!' he thereby bestows life (vital strength) upon him. With a view to commencing the sacrifice, he then says to him, 'Restrain thy speech!' for the sacrifice is speech.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:8">13:4:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. Four (of the king's) wives are in attendance--the consecrated queen, the favourite wife, a discarded wife, and the P&acirc;l&acirc;gal&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, all of them adorned and wearing gold ornaments (neck-plates)--with the view of the completeness of conjugal union. With them he enters the hall of the sacrificial fires--the Sacrificer by the eastern, the wives by the southern, door.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:9">13:4:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. When the evening-offering&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> has been performed, he lies down with his favourite wife behind the G&acirc;rhapatya hearth, with his head towards the north. At the same place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the other (wives) also lie down. He lies in her lap without embracing her&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, thinking, 'May I, by this self-restraint, reach successfully the end of the year!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:10">13:4:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. When the morning offering has been performed, the Adhvaryu performs a full-offering&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_899"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> with a view to his (the Sacrificer's) gaining and securing everything, for the full means everything, and the A<I>s</I>vamedha is everything. At this (offering) he releases speech by (bestowing) a boon,</p>

<p><A NAME="page_350"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 350</FONT></A></p>  
<p>saying, 'I grant a boon to the Brahman (priest):' (this he does) with a view to his gaining and securing everything, for a boon is everything, and the A<I>s</I>vamedha is everything.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:11">13:4:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. The gold ornament which is attached to his (neck) he then gives to the Adhvaryu: in giving it to the Adhvaryu he secures to himself immortal life, for gold means immortal life.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:12">13:4:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. For the object of (gaining) the road, and in order not to lose the mouth (mukha) of the sacrifice, he then prepares an ish<I>t</I>i-offering&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to Agni. For, indeed, all the deities have Agni for their mouth, and in the A<I>s</I>vamedha are (contained) all objects of desire: 'Having, at the outset (mukha<I>t</I>a<I>h</I>), gratified all the gods, may I obtain all my desires!' so he thinks.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:13">13:4:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. For this (offering) there are fifteen kindling-verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; for fifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means vigour: with the thunderbolt (of) vigour the Sacrificer thus from the first repels evil. The two butter-portions relate to the slaying of V<I>ri</I>tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_902"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, with a view to the repelling of evil, for</p>

XIII, 14, 15,] 'Agni, the head, the summit of the sky . . .&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_903"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,' and 'Be thou the leader of the sacrifice and the realm of space (whither thou strivest with auspicious teams: thy light-winning head hast thou raised to the sky, and thy tongue, O Agni, hast thou made the bearer of the offering),' pronounced in a low voice, are the anuv&acirc;ky&acirc; and y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; of the chief oblation. The one contains (the word) <font size="-1" color="green">'</font>head,' the other (the verb) 'to be,'--for the head, assuredly, is he that shines yonder: thus it is in order to secure him (the Sun); and as to why (the other) contains (the verb) 'to be,'--he thereby secures that which is (the real, truly existent). The Sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_904"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are two vir&acirc;<I>g</I>-verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_905"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; for that--to wit, the Vir&acirc;<I>g</I>--is the metre</p>

<p>belonging to all the gods, and all objects of desire are (contained) in the A<I>s</I>vamedha: 'Having gratified all the gods, may I obtain all my desires!' so he thinks. The sacrificial fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the meaning of this has been explained.</p>

He then prepares a (pap) for P&ucirc;shan, for P&ucirc;shan is the overlord of roads: he thus secures successful progress to the horse. But P&ucirc;shan is also this (earth): he thus makes this (earth) its guardian, for neither injury nor failure befals him whom this (earth) guards on the way; and this (earth) he thus makes its guardian.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:1:15">13:4:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. For this (offering) there are seventeen kindling-verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_906"></A><A HREF="#fn_902"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for the obtainment of the A<I>s</I>vamedha, for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is seventeenfold, and the A<I>s</I>vamedha is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. The two butter-portions are possessed of 'growth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_907"></A><A HREF="#fn_903"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,' even for the growth of the Sacrificer. [The verses, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S.

<p>the guardian of every path: (may he, P&ucirc;shan, grant unto us draughts of light (?), and fulfil our every prayer!'), pronounced in a low voice, are the anuv&acirc;ky&acirc; and y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; of the chief oblation. The one contains (the word) 'sway,' the other (the word) 'path'; for sway is vigour: (thus it is) in order to his gaining and securing vigour; and as to why (the other) contains (the word) 'path,' he thereby secures successful progress to the horse. The invitatory and offering formulas of the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t are two anush<I>t</I>ubh verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_908"></A><A HREF="sbe44103.htm#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for the Anush<I>t</I>ubh is speech, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is speech, and the A<I>s</I>vamedha is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati: thus it is for the obtainment of the A<I>s</I>vamedha. The priests&#8217; fee consists of a hundred garments, for that--to wit, the garment--is man's outward appearance, whence people (on seeing) Any well-clad man, ask, 'Who can this be? for he is perfect in his outward appearance: with outward appearance he thus endows him. There are a hundred of them, for man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred energies: life, and energy, vigour, he thus gains for himself.</p>
