### FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE STOTRAS AND *S*ASTRAS OF THE SOMA-DAYS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:1">13:5:1:1</span></span>1.
Then, on the morrow, there is (used) Gotama's Stoma (form of chanting)
successively increasing by four (verses) <span
id="fr_981"></span>[3](#fn_976): the Bahishpavamâna thereof is on four,
the Â*g*ya (stotras) on eight, the Mâdhyandina Pavamâna on twelve, the
P*ri*sh*th*a (stotras) on

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

sixteen, the Ârbhava Pavamâna on twenty, and the Agnish*t*oma-sâman on
twenty-four (verses).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:2">13:5:1:2</span></span>2. Now,
some make its Agnish*t*oma-sâman a Sâman of four (verses), saying, 'It
is neither an Agnish*t*oma, nor an Ukthya <span
id="fr_982"></span>[1](#fn_977).' If they do so, let hire (the Hot*ri*),

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

after reciting the Stotriya <span id="fr_983"></span>[1](#fn_978)
(strophe) together, recite the Anurûpa (strophe) together: the
Rathantara P*ri*sh*th*a-sâman <span id="fr_984"></span>[2](#fn_979), the
*S*astra containing the Rathantara (text), and the Agnish*t*oma
sacrifice--thereby he makes sure of this world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:3">13:5:1:3</span></span>3.
'There are twenty-one Savanîya <span id="fr_985"></span>[3](#fn_980)
victims, all of them sacred to Agni: for these there is one and the same
performance,' so say some; but, indeed, he should immolate two sets of
eleven (victims), with the view of his obtainment of whatever desired
object there may be in (victims) belonging to a set of eleven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:4">13:5:1:4</span></span>4. When
the Agnish*t*oma is completed, and the Vasatîvarî water carried round,
the Adhvaryu performs the Annahomas <span
id="fr_986"></span>[4](#fn_981) (oblations of food): the import of these
has been explained. With twelve

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Anuvâkas (Vâ*g*.
S. XXII, 23-34), 'To the in-breathing hail! To the off-breathing hail!'
(he offers)--twelve months are a year, and the year is everything, and
the A*s*vamedha is everything: thus it is for his obtaining and securing
everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:5">13:5:1:5</span></span>5. The
central day is an ekavi*ms*a day <span id="fr_987"></span>[1](#fn_982);
for the twenty-one-fold is yonder sun, and he is the A*s*vamedha: by
means of his own Stoma he thus establishes him in his own
deity,--therefore it is an ekavi*ms*a day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:6">13:5:1:6</span></span>6. And,
again, as to why it is an ekavi*ms*a day;--man is twenty-one-fold--ten
fingers, ten toes, and the body (self) as the twenty-first: by means of
that twenty-one-fold self he thus establishes him in the twenty-one-fold
(day) as on a firm foundation,--therefore it is an ekavi*ms*a day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:7">13:5:1:7</span></span>7. And,
again, as to why it is an ekavi*ms*a day;--the ekavi*ms*a, assuredly, is
the foundation of Stomas, and manifold is that ever-varying performance
which takes place on this day,--and it is because he thinks that that
manifold and ever-varying performance which takes place on this day,
shall take place so as to be established on the ekavi*ms*a as a firm
foundation, that this is an ekavi*ms*a day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:8">13:5:1:8</span></span>8. Now,
as to the morning-service of this day. The Hot*ri*, having recited as
the Â*g*ya (hymn <span id="fr_988"></span>[2](#fn_983)) in the Paṅkti
(metre) 'Agni I think on, who is good . . .,' recites thereto the one of
a one-day's

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Soma-sacrifice <span id="fr_989"></span>[1](#fn_984). And the Bârhata
Praüga and the Mâdhu*kh*andasa one he recites both together <span
id="fr_990"></span>[2](#fn_985) in triplets--(this being done) for the
obtainment of the objects of desire which (may be contained) both in the
Bârhata and the Mâdhu*kh*andasa Praüga. The morning-service is (thus)
set right.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:9">13:5:1:9</span></span>9. Then
as to the midday-service. For the obtainment of the A*s*vamedha, the
ati*kh*andas (verse, II, 22, 1), 'In the three troughs the buffalo drank
the barley-draught,' is the opening verse of the Marutvatîya (*s*astra);
for outstanding, indeed, is this ati*kh*andas (hypercatalectic verse)
amongst metres, and outstanding is the A*s*vamedha amongst sacrifices.
This (verse), being recited thrice, amounts to a triplet, and thereby he
obtains the object of desire which (may be contained) in the triplet.
'Here, O good one, is the pressed plant' (*Ri*g-veda VIII, 2, 1-3) is
the 'anu*k*ara' (sequent triplet): this same (triplet) is the constant

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

connecting link of the one-day's sacrifice <span
id="fr_991"></span>[1](#fn_986). Having recited both the paṅkti (verses,
I, 80, 1-16) 'Here in the Soma-draught alone (the Brahman gave thee
strength),' and the six-footed ones (VIII, 36, 1-7) 'The patron thou art
of the offerer of Soma,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the
one-day's sacrifice. Thus as to the Marutvatîya (-*s*astra).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:10">13:5:1:10</span></span>10.
Then as to the Nishkevalya (-*s*astra <span
id="fr_992"></span>[2](#fn_987)). The Mahânâmnî (verses) are the
P*ri*sh*th*a (-stotra); and he recites them along with the anurûpa
(verses) and pragâtha (-strophes), for the obtainment of all the objects
of his desire, for in the Mahânâmnîs, as well as in the A*s*vamedha, are
contained all objects of desire. Having recited the paṅkti verses (I,
81, 1-9) 'Indra hath grown in ebriety and strength,' and the six-footed
ones (VIII, 37, 1-7) 'This sacred work didst thou protect in

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

fights with V*ri*tra,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the
one-day's sacrifice <span id="fr_993"></span>[1](#fn_988). The
midday-service is (thus) set right.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:11">13:5:1:11</span></span>11.
Then as to the evening-service. The atî*kh*andas verse (Vâ*g*. S. IV,
25), 'Unto that god Savit*ri* within the two bowls (do I sing
praises <span id="fr_994"></span>[2](#fn_989)),' is the opening
verse <span id="fr_995"></span>[3](#fn_990) of the
Vai*s*vadeva(-*s*astra <span id="fr_996"></span>[4](#fn_991)): the
mystic import thereof is the same as of the former (ati*kh*andas verse).
The Anu*k*ara <span id="fr_997"></span>[5](#fn_992) (*Ri*g-veda I, 24,
3-5), 'Unto (abhi) thee, (the lord of treasures), O god Savit*ri*, (ever
helpful we come for our share . . .),' contains (the word) 'abhi,' as a
form (sign) of victory (abhibhûti). Having recited the Sâvitra (triplet,
VI, 71, 4-6), 'Up rose this god Savit*ri*, the friend of the house . .
.,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-day's sacrifice <span
id="fr_998"></span>[6](#fn_993). Having recited the four verses to
Heaven and Earth (IV, 56, 1-4), 'The mighty Heaven and Earth, the most
glorious, here . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn I, 159) of the
one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the Ârbhava (hymn, IV, 34),
'*Ri*bhu, Vibhvan, Indra, Vâ*g*a, come ye to this our sacrifice . . .,'

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I, 111) of the one-day's sacrifice.
Having recited the (hymn, V, 41) to the All-gods, 'Who is there
righteous unto you, Mitra and Varu*n*a? . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in
the (hymn, I, 89) of the one-day's sacrifice. Thus as to the
Vai*s*vadeva (-*s*astra).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:12">13:5:1:12</span></span>12.
Then as to the Âgnimâruta <span id="fr_999"></span>[1](#fn_994). Having
recited the (hymn, VI, 7) to (Agni) Vai*s*vânara, 'The head of the sky,
and the disposer of the earth . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn,
III, 3) of the one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the (hymn, V, 57) to
the Maruts, 'Hither, O Rudras, come ye united with Indra . . .,' he
inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I, 87) of the one-day's sacrifice.
Having recited the nine verses (VI, 15, 1-9) to *G*âtavedas, 'This guest
of yours, the early-waking . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I,
143) of the one-day's sacrifice. And as to why the (hymns) of the
one-day's sacrifice are used for inserting the Nivid, it is for the sake
of his (the Sacrificer's) not being deprived of a firm foundation, for
the *G*yotish*t*oma is a foundation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:13">13:5:1:13</span></span>13.
For this (day) there are those sacrificial animals--'A horse, a hornless
he-goat, and a Gom*ri*ga <span id="fr_1000"></span>[2](#fn_995),'
fifteen 'paryaṅgyas': the mystic import of these has been explained.
Then these wild ones--for spring he seizes (three) kapi*ñg*alas <span
id="fr_1001"></span>[3](#fn_996), for summer sparrows, for the rainy
season partridges: of these

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

(wild animals) also (the mystic import) has been told <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[1](#fn_997).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:14">13:5:1:14</span></span>14.
Then those (victims) for the twenty-one (stakes). He seizes twenty-one
animals for each of the (eleven) deities of the Seasonal offerings <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[2](#fn_998); for as many as there are gods of the
Seasonal offerings so many are all the gods; and all objects of desire
are in the A*s*vamedha: 'by gratifying all the deities I shall gain all
my desires,' so he thinks. But let him not proceed in this way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:15">13:5:1:15</span></span>15.
Let him seize seventeen victims for the central stake <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[3](#fn_999), in order that he may gain and secure
every-thing,

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

for the seventeenfold is Pra*g*âpati, and the seventeenfold (stoma) is
everything, and the A*s*vamedha is everything;--and sixteen at each of
the other (stakes) in order that he may gain and secure everything, for
everything here consists of sixteen parts, and the A*s*vamedha is
everything. Thirteen wild (beasts) he seizes for each intermediate
space, in order that he may gain and secure everything, for the year
consists of thirteen months, and the A*s*vamedha is everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:16">13:5:1:16</span></span>16.
Now, prior to the (chanting of the) Bahishpavamâna, they (the assistants
of the Adhvaryu) bring up the horse, after cleansing it; and with it
they glide along for the Pavamâna: the mystic import of this has been
explained <span id="fr_1005"></span>[1](#fn_1000). When the
Bahishpavamâna has been chanted, they make the horse step on the place
of chanting: if it sniffs, or turns away, let him know that his
sacrifice is successful. Having led up that (horse), the Adhvaryu says,
'Hot*ri*, sing praises!' and the Hot*ri* sings its praises <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[2](#fn_1001) with eleven (verses, *Ri*g-veda I,
163, 1-11)--

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:17">13:5:1:17</span></span>17.
'When, first born, thou didst neigh . . .'--thrice (he praises) with the
first, and thrice with the last (verse), these amount to
fifteen,--fifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means
vigour: with that thunderbolt, vigour, the Sacrificer thus from the very
first repels evil: thus <span id="fr_1007"></span>[3](#fn_1002), indeed,
it is to the Sacrificer that the thunderbolt is given in

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

order to smite for him whoever is to be smitten.--\[*Ri*g-veda I, 163,
12. 13\], The swift racer hath gone forward to the slaying. . . .'--'The
racer hath gone forward to the highest place. . .'--

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:1:18">13:5:1:18</span></span>18.
Having omitted these two (verses), he inserts the hymn (I, 162), 'Never
(shall forget us) Mitra, Varu*n*a, Aryaman, Âyu . . .,' in the
Adhrigu <span id="fr_1008"></span>[1](#fn_1003) (litany). Some, however,
insert this verse (I, 162, 18), 'Thirty-four (ribs) of the steed, akin
to the gods, (doth the knife hit) . . .,' before the
(passage,--'twenty-six are its) ribs,' thinking lest they should place
the holy syllable 'om' in the wrong place <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[2](#fn_1004), or lest they should suggest the
plural by a singular <span id="fr_1010"></span>[3](#fn_1005). Let him
not proceed thus, but let him insert the hymn as a whole.--'The swift
racer hath gone forward to the slaying . . .'--'The racer hath gone
forward to the highest place . . .'--

<span id="fn_974"></span>[375:1](sbe44105.htm#fr_979) 'From natural
fissures and incisions made in the bark (of Butea frondosa) issues
during the hot season a red juice, which soon hardens into a
ruby-coloured, brittle, astringent gum, similar to kino, and sold as
Bengal kino.' Stewart and Brandis.

<span id="fn_975"></span>[375:2](sbe44105.htm#fr_980) See [p.
331](sbe44095.htm#page_331), note [1](sbe44095.htm#fn_840).

<span id="fn_976"></span>[375:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_981) Regarding the
*K*atush*t*oma, see [p. 329](sbe44094.htm#page_329), note
[1](sbe44094.htm#fn_836).

<span id="fn_977"></span>[376:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_982) According to the
practice here referred to, the Agnish*t*omasâman would not consist
merely of the one triplet (usually Sâmav. II, 53-4 i.e. the so-called
ya*gñ*âya*gñ*îya triplet) ordinarily used for it, but of four different
Sâmans, inasmuch as three of the triplets which may be used for the
Uktha-stotras (of the Ukthya and other sacrifices) are added to that
ya*gñ*âya*gñ*îya triplet. In that case, however, the latter is not
chanted to its own 'ya*gñ*âya*gñ*îya' tune, but the Vâravantîya tune is
used for all the four triplets. This practice is somewhat vaguely
referred to in Tâ*nd*ya-Br. XIX, 5, 10-11. 'One Sâman (tune), many
metres (texts): therefore one (man) feeds many creatures. Verily, the
Agnish*t*oma (sâman) is the self, and the metres (hymn-texts) are
cattle: he thus secures cattle for his own self. It is neither an Ukthya
nor an Agnish*t*oma (sacrifice), for cattle are neither (entirely)
domestic nor wild (viz. because though kept "in the village," they also
freely graze "in the forest").' Here the passage 'One Sâman, many
metres,' according to the commentary, refers to the Vâravantîya tune as
being employed, on this occasion, for the texts of the Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*îya,
the Sâkama*s*va (II, 55-57, here the Calc. ed., by mistake, calls the
second tune figured for chanting, like the first, Sâkama*s*va, instead
of Vâravantîya), the Saubhara (II, 230-2, where the Calc. ed., by
mistake, omits the name Vâravantîya), and the Taira*sk*a (II, 233-5;
curiously enough, the Taira*sk*a is not mentioned, in Lâ*t*y. Sr. VIII,
9-10, amongst the Sâmans that may be used for the third--or the
A*kkh*âvâka's--Uktha, but Sâya*n*a, on Sâmav. II, 233, states
distinctly, 'taira*sk*a*m* t*ri*tîyam uktham'). Whilst, as
Uktha-stotras, the last three texts would usually he chanted in the
ekavi*ms*a, or twenty-one-versed form, in the present instance, as part
of the *k*atush*t*oma, they would be chanted (along with the
Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*îya) in the twenty-four-versed form. Thus, though an
Agnish*t*oma sacrifice, inasmuch as it has twelve stotras, yet it is not
a regular one; neither is it an Ukthya, because the Ukthas are not
chanted as so many Stotras, followed by the recitation of separate
Sastras. In the Â*s*v. *S*r. X, 6, different alternatives are proposed
for the chanting of the Agnish*t*oma-sâman <span id="page_377">p.
377</span> in the 'Gotamastoma (i.e. *K*atush*t*oma) antarukthya' and
the corresponding Sastra, including apparently the employment of the
Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*îya-sâman either for all the four triplets, or for the
Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*îya triplet alone with the respective Sâmans used for the
other triplets; different modes of recitation being thereby implied with
regard to the Stotriya and Anurûpa pragâthas.

<span id="fn_978"></span>[377:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_983) For the
Âgnimâruta-*s*astra, recited by the Hot*ri* after the chanting of the
Agnish*t*oma-sâman, and containing, amongst various hymns and detached
verses, the triplet which forms the text of the Stotra, i.e. the
'Stotriya pragâtha,' as well as a corresponding antistrophe, the
'Anurûpa pragâtha,' see part ii, p. 369 note. On the present occasion,
however, this constituent element of the Sastra would have to include
the triplets of all the four Sâmans, as well as four 'antistrophes'
which are thus 'recited together.'

<span id="fn_979"></span>[377:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_984) Or,
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra, viz. the first stotra of that name at the
midday-service, for which that Sâman is used in the Agnish*t*oma
sacrifice (part ii, p. 339, note 2).

<span id="fn_980"></span>[377:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_985) That is, victims
sacrificed on the Sutyâs, or Soma-days. Two complete sets of eleven such
victims are, however, required on each of the three days, see [p.
309](sbe44087.htm#page_309), note [2](sbe44087.htm#fn_787).

<span id="fn_981"></span>[377:4](sbe44106.htm#fr_986) See [XIII, 2, 1,
1](sbe44083.htm#13:2:1:1) seqq., and [p. 297](sbe44083.htm#page_297),
note [1](sbe44083.htm#fn_747).

<span id="fn_982"></span>[378:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_987) That is one on
which all Stotras are chanted in the 'ekavi*ms*a' Stoma, or
twenty-one-versed hymn-form.

<span id="fn_983"></span>[378:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_988) Viz. *Ri*g-veda V,
6, forming the special feature of the Â*g*ya*s*astra at the A*s*vamedha.

<span id="fn_984"></span>[379:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_989) Viz. the
Â*g*ya-sûkta, *Ri*g-veda III, 13, forming the chief part of the
Hot*ri*'s Â*g*ya-*s*astra, or first *S*astra of the Agnish*t*oma, for
which see part ii, p. 327 note.

<span id="fn_985"></span>[379:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_990) The Bârhata
Praüga, or Praüga-*s*astra in the B*ri*hatî metre,--being the one
recited on the fifth day of the P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha (Â*s*v. *S*r.
VII, 12, 7), and consisting of the seven different triplets, addressed
to as many different deities,--is to be recited also on this occasion;
and along with it (or rather, intertwined with it, triplet by triplet)
the ordinary Praüga-*s*astra of the Agnish*t*oma, made up of the two
hymns Rig-veda I, 2 and 3 which are ascribed to Madhu*kh*andas, and
consist of nine and twelve verses, or together seven triplets. I do not
understand why Harisvâmin mentions 'Vâyur agregâ*h*' (? Vâ*g*. S. XXVII,
31) as being the first triplet of the Mâdhu*kh*andasa Praüga, instead of
I, 2, 1-3 'vâyav â yâhi dar*s*ata.' The Praüga is the Hot*ri*'s second
*S*astra of the morning-service, being preceded by the chanting of the
first Â*g*ya-stotra; see part ii, p. 325.

<span id="fn_986"></span>[380:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_991) See part ii, p.
337, where the same triplet forms the anu*k*ara of this Sastra at the
Agnish*t*oma. It is followed there by the Pragâthas VIII, 53, 5-6; I,
40, 5-6 (read thus! each two counting as one triplet); three Dhâyyâ
verses, and the Marutvatîya Pragâthas VIII, 89, 3-4 (!), These are to be
followed up, on the present occasion, by the two hymns I, 80, and VIII,
36, after which the Indra hymn X, 73, the chief part of the normal
Marutvatîya Sastra, is to be recited, with the Nivid formula inserted
after the sixth verse.

<span id="fn_987"></span>[380:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_992) That is, the
*S*astra succeeding the chanting of the first, or Hot*ri*'s,
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra (see part ii, p. 339). Whilst, however, in the
one-day's sacrifice, the Rathantara (or the B*ri*hat) sâman is used for
that stotra, the Mahânâmni verses (see part iii, introd. p. xx, note 2),
with the Sâkvara tune, are to be used as the Stotriyâs on this occasion,
and are therefore likewise to be recited by the Hot*ri* as
Stotriya-pragâthas (cf. Â*s*v. VII, 12, 10 seqq.), to be followed up by
the antistrophe (anurûpa)--here consisting of the triplets I, 84, 10-12;
VIII, 93, 31-3; I, 11, 1-3--and the Sâma-pragâtha, VIII, 3, 1-2.

<span id="fn_988"></span>[381:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_993) Viz. after the
eighth verse of the hymn *Ri*g-veda I, 32, the chief part of the normal
Nishkevalya-*s*astra.

<span id="fn_989"></span>[381:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_994) For the complete
verse see III, 3, 2, 1 2.

<span id="fn_990"></span>[381:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_995) This verse is
again recited thrice, and thus takes the place of the ordinary opening
triplet.

<span id="fn_991"></span>[381:4](sbe44106.htm#fr_996) For this *S*astra,
recited after the Ârbhava-Pavamâna-stotra, see part ii, p. 361.

<span id="fn_992"></span>[381:5](sbe44106.htm#fr_997) Â*s*v. *S*r. X,
10, 6 prescribes the ordinary anu*k*ara V, 82, 4-7; whence Sâya*n*a on
I, 24, 3 (-5) offers no indication of the ritualistic use of that
triplet on this occasion.

<span id="fn_993"></span>[381:6](sbe44106.htm#fr_998) Viz. IV, 54,
before the last verse of which the Nivid is inserted.

<span id="fn_994"></span>[382:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_999) Viz. the final
Sastra of the evening-service, preceded by the chanting of the
Agnish*t*oma-sâman; see part ii, p. 369.

<span id="fn_995"></span>[382:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_1000) See [p.
298](sbe44083.htm#page_298), note [4](sbe44084.htm#fn_753); [p.
338](sbe44097.htm#page_338), note [1](sbe44097.htm#fn_859).

<span id="fn_996"></span>[382:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_1001) The 'Kapi*ñg*ala'
is a kind of wildfowl, apparently of the quail or partridge species--a
hazel-cock, or francoline partridge. Some of the later authorities,
however, identify it with the '*k*âtaka' <span id="page_383">p.
383</span> ('cuculus melanoleucus'). With regard to some of the wild
animals referred to in the corresponding section of the Vâ*g*. S., the
commentator Mahîdhara significantly remarks (Vâ*g*. S. XXIV, 29; cf.
Kâty. XX, 6, 6 scholl.) that the meaning of such names as are not
understood must be made out with the help of quotations (nigama), Vedic
vocabularies (nigha*nt*u) and their comments (nirukta), grammar
(vyâkara*n*a), the Unâdiv*ri*tti, and dictionaries.

<span id="fn_997"></span>[383:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_1002) Viz. XIII, 2, 4,
1 seqq. It is not easy to see why the text should break off abruptly
with the birds representing the rainy season. For autumn there are to be
(three) quails, for winter 'kakara,' and for the dewy season 'vikakara.'
Then follow, to the end of the 260 wild animals, a long series of
divinities to each of which (or sometimes to allied deities) three
animals are consigned. Thirteen of these wild animals are placed on each
of the twenty spaces between the twenty-one stakes.

<span id="fn_998"></span>[383:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_1003) Or, perhaps, for
the (eleven) deities of the Seasonal offerings he seizes twenty-one
animals for each (stake); which would certainly simplify the
distribution of those animals. Regarding the victims actually
consecrated to the deities of the *K*âturmâsya offerings, see [p.
309](sbe44087.htm#page_309), note [2](sbe44087.htm#fn_787).

<span id="fn_999"></span>[383:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_1004) This does not
include the twelve 'paryaṅgyas' tied to the horse's limbs, but only the
horse and two other victims sacred to Pra*g*âpati, and twelve of a long
series of beasts, of which three are dedicated to each successive deity
(or allied group of deities). To these are afterwards added Agni's two
victims belonging to the two sets of eleven victims (of the other twenty
of which one is assigned to each of the other stakes).

<span id="fn_1000"></span>[384:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_1005) [XIII, 2, 3,
1](sbe44085.htm#13:2:3:1).

<span id="fn_1001"></span>[384:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_1006) The mode of
recitation is similar to that of the kindling-verses (likewise eleven,
brought up, by *r*epetitions of the first and last, to fifteen), viz. by
making a pause after each half-verse, but without adding the syllable
'om' thereto. Â*s*v. *S*r. X, 8, 5.

<span id="fn_1002"></span>[384:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_1007) Harisvâmin
explains 'tad vai' as standing for 'sa vai' (liṅgavyatyayena)--viz. that
fifteenfold thunderbolt.

<span id="fn_1003"></span>[385:1](sbe44106.htm#fr_1008) On this
recitation, consisting of a lengthy set of formulas, addressed to the
slaughterers, see part ii, p, 188, note 2. The whole of the formulas are
given Ait. Br. II, 6-7. The hymn, according to Â*s*v. X, 8, 7; is to be
inserted either before the last formula of the litany, or somewhat
further back--viz. before the formula 'sha*d*vi*ms*atir asya vaṅkrayas,'
'twenty-six are its ribs'--whilst our Brâhma*n*a rather allows the
alternative of the eighteenth verse of I, 162 being inserted at the
latter place,--unless, indeed, the insertion in that case is to be made
immediately before the word 'vaṅkraya*h*' which is scarcely likely.

<span id="fn_1004"></span>[385:2](sbe44106.htm#fr_1009) Harisvâmin seems
to take this to mean that as this verse is of the same nature as the
formulas of the Adhrigu litany, he is to treat it as such, as otherwise,
in reciting he would have to pronounce 'om' after that verse, which is
not done after those formulas.

<span id="fn_1005"></span>[385:3](sbe44106.htm#fr_1010) Or, the
plurality by the individual. Owing to the corrupt state of the MS., the
commentator's explanation of this passage is not clear. He seems,
however, at any rate, to take the 'plural' to refer to the formula
'sha*d*vi*ms*atir asya vaṅkrayas,' where apparently 'eshâm' has to be
substituted for 'asya' on this occasion, as many victims are immolated,
and the ribs of a plurality of beasts are thus indicated, whilst in
verse eighteen of the hymn, on the <span id="page_386">p. 386</span>
contrary, only the ribs of one horse (thus forming a kind of unit) are
referred to; and if that verse were recited, along with the whole hymn,
before the final formula which refers to all the victims, the necessary
connection would be interrupted.
