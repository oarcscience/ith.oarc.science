# FOURTEENTH KÂ*ND*A.

#### THE PRAVARGYA.

### FIRST ADHYÂYA, FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:1">14:1:1:1</span></span>1. The
gods Agni, Indra, Soma, Makha, Vish*n*u, and the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*, except
the two A*s*vins, performed a sacrificial session <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[1](#fn_1169.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:2">14:1:1:2</span></span>2.
Their place of divine worship was Kurukshetra.. Therefore people say
that Kurukshetra is the gods’ place of divine worship: hence wherever in
Kurukshetra one settles there one thinks, 'This is a place for divine
worship;' for it was the gods’ place of divine worship.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:3">14:1:1:3</span></span>3. They
entered upon the session <span id="fr_1178"></span>[2](#fn_1170.md)
thinking, 'May we attain excellence! may we become glorious! may we
become eaters of food!' And in like manner do these (men) now enter upon
the sacrificial session thinking, 'May we attain excellence! may we
become glorious! may we become eaters of food!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:4">14:1:1:4</span></span>4. They
spake, 'Whoever of us, through austerity, fervour, faith, sacrifice, and
oblations, shall first compass the end of the sacrifice, he shall be the
most excellent of us, and shall then be in common to us all.' 'So be
it,' they said.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:5">14:1:1:5</span></span>5.
Vish*n*u first attained it, and he became the

<span id="page_442">p. 442</span>

most excellent of the gods; whence people say, 'Vish*n*u is the most
excellent of the gods.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:6">14:1:1:6</span></span>6. Now
he who is this Vish*n*u is the sacrifice; and he who is this sacrifice
is yonder Âditya (the sun). But, indeed, Vish*n*u was unable to control
that (love of) glory of his; and so even now not every one can control
that (love of) glory of his.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:7">14:1:1:7</span></span>7.
Taking his bow, together with three arrows, he stepped forth. He stood,
resting his head on the end of the bow. Not daring to attack him, the
gods sat themselves down all around him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:8">14:1:1:8</span></span>8. Then
the ants said--these ants (vamrî), doubtless, were that (kind called)
'upadîkâ <span id="fr_1179"></span>[1](#fn_1171.md)'--'What would ye give
to him who should gnaw the bowstring?'--'We would give him the
(constant) enjoyment of food, and he would find water even in the
desert: so we would give him every enjoyment of food.'--'So be it,' they
said.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:9">14:1:1:9</span></span>9.
Having gone nigh unto him, they gnawed his bowstring. When it was cut,
the ends of the bow, springing asunder, cut off Vish*n*u's head.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:10">14:1:1:10</span></span>10.
It fell with (the sound) 'gh*ri*ṅ'; and on falling it became yonder sun.
And the rest (of the body) lay stretched out (with the top part) towards
the east. And inasmuch as it fell with (the sound) 'gh*ri*ṅ,' therefrom
the Gharma <span id="fr_1180"></span>[2](#fn_1172) (was called.md); and
inasmuch as he was stretched out (pra-v*rig*,), therefrom the Pravargya
(took its name).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:11">14:1:1:11</span></span>11.
The gods spake, 'Verily, our great hero

<span id="page_443">p. 443</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (mahân vira*h*)
has fallen:' therefrom the Mahâvîra pot (was named). And the vital sap
which flowed from him they wiped up (sam-m*rig*) with their hands,
whence the Samrâ*g* <span id="fr_1181"></span>[1](#fn_1173.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:12">14:1:1:12</span></span>12.
The gods rushed forward to him, even as those eager to secure some gain
(will do) <span id="fr_1182"></span>[2](#fn_1174.md). Indra reached him
first. He applied himself to him limb after limb, and encompassed
him <span id="fr_1183"></span>[3](#fn_1175.md), and, in encompassing him,
he became (possessed of) that glory of his. And, verily, he who knows
this becomes (possessed of) that glory which Indra is (possessed of).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:13">14:1:1:13</span></span>13.
And Makha (sacrifice), indeed, is the same as Vish*n*u: hence Indra
became Makhavat (possessed of makha), since Makhavat is he who is
mystically called Maghavat <span id="fr_1184"></span>[4](#fn_1176.md), for
the gods love the mystic.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:14">14:1:1:14</span></span>14.
They gave to those ants the enjoyment of food; but, indeed, all food is
water, for it is by moistening (the food) therewith that one eats here
whatever one does eat.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:15">14:1:1:15</span></span>15.
This Vish*n*u, the (Soma-) sacrifice, they then divided amongst
themselves into three parts: the Vasus (received) the morning-pressing,
the Rudras the midday-pressing, and the Âdityas the third pressing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:16">14:1:1:16</span></span>16.
Agni (received) the morning-pressing, Indra

<span id="page_444">p. 444</span>

the midday-pressing, and the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* the third pressing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:17">14:1:1:17</span></span>17.
The Gâyatrî (received) the morning-pressing, the Trish*t*ubh the
midday-pressing, and the *G*agatî the third pressing. The gods went on
worshipping and toiling with that headless sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:18">14:1:1:18</span></span>18.
Now Dadhya*ñk* Âtharva*n*a knew this pure essence <span
id="fr_1185"></span>[1](#fn_1177.md), this Sacrifice,--how this head of the
Sacrifice is put on again, how this Sacrifice becomes complete.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:19">14:1:1:19</span></span>19.
He then was spoken to by Indra saying, 'If thou teachest this
(sacrificial mystery) to any one else, I shall cut off thy head.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:20">14:1:1:20</span></span>20.
Now this was heard by the A*s*vins,--'Verily, Dadhya*ñk* Âtharva*n*a
knows this pure essence, this Sacrifice,--how this head of the Sacrifice
is put on again, how this Sacrifice becomes complete.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:21">14:1:1:21</span></span>21.
They went up to him and said, 'We two will become thy pupils.'--'What
are ye wishing to learn?' he asked.--'This pure essence, this
Sacrifice,--how this head of the Sacrifice is put on again, how this
Sacrifice becomes complete,' they replied.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:22">14:1:1:22</span></span>22.
He said, 'I was spoken to by Indra saying, ‘If thou teachest this to any
one else, I shall cut off thy head;’ therefore I am afraid lest he
should indeed cut off my head: I cannot take you as my pupils.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:23">14:1:1:23</span></span>23.
They said, 'We two shall protect thee from him.'--'How will ye protect
me?' he replied.--They said, 'When thou wilt have received us as thy

<span id="page_445">p. 445</span>

pupils, we shall cut off thy head and put it aside elsewhere; then we
shall fetch the head of a horse, and put it on thee: therewith thou wilt
teach us; and when thou wilt have taught us, then Indra will cut off
that head of thine; and we shall fetch thine own head, and put it on
thee again.'--'So be it,' he replied.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:24">14:1:1:24</span></span>24.
He then received them (as his pupils); and when he had received them,
they cut off his head, and put it aside elsewhere; and having fetched
the head of a horse, they put it on him: therewith he taught them; and
when he had taught them, Indra cut off that head of his; and having
fetched his own head, they put it on him again,

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:25">14:1:1:25</span></span>25.
Therefore it is concerning this that the *Ri*shi has said (*Ri*g-v. I,
116, 12), 'That Dadhya*ñk* Âtharva*n*a, with a horse's head, anywise
spoke forth unto you two the sweet doctrine:'--'Unrestrainedly he spoke
this,' is what is thereby meant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:26">14:1:1:26</span></span>26.
One must not teach this to any and every one, since that would be
sinful, and lest Indra should cut off his head; but one may only teach
it to one who is known to him, and who has studied sacred writ, and who
may be dear to him, but not to any and every one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:27">14:1:1:27</span></span>27.
He may teach it to one dwelling with him (as a pupil) for a year; for
the year is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun):
it is him he thereby gratifies, and therefore he may teach it to one
dwelling with him for a year.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:28">14:1:1:28</span></span>28.
For three nights he keeps the rule (of abstinence); for there are three
seasons in the year, and the year is he that shines yonder, and the
Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thereby

<span id="page_446">p. 446</span>

gratifies, and therefore he keeps the rule for three nights.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:29">14:1:1:29</span></span>29.
Hot <span id="fr_1186"></span>[1](#fn_1178) (water.md) he sips, thinking,
'I will teach it as one practising austerities.' He teaches it whilst
abstaining from flesh-food, thinking, 'I will teach it as one practising
austerities;'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:30">14:1:1:30</span></span>30.
And whilst not drinking out of earthen (vessels); for whatever untruth
(man) speaks on this (earth) is, as it were, immixed with her: therefore
(one should do so) whilst not drinking out of earthen (vessels);

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:31">14:1:1:31</span></span>31.
And whilst not coming into contact with *S*ûdras and remains of food;
for this Gharma is he that shines yonder, and he is excellence, truth,
and light; but woman, the *S*ûdra, the dog, and the black bird (the
crow), are untruth: he should not look at these, lest he should mingle
excellence and sin, light and darkness, truth and untruth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:32">14:1:1:32</span></span>32.
And, verily, he that shines yonder is glory; and as to that glory,
Âditya (the sun), that glory is just the sacrifice; and as to that
glory, the sacrifice, that glory is just the Sacrificer; and as to that
glory, the Sacrificer, that glory is just the officiating priests; and
as to that glory, the officiating priests, that glory is just the
sacrificial gifts: hence, if they bring up to him a dakshi*n*â he must
not, at least on the same day, make over these (objects) to any one else
lest he should make over to some one else that glory which has come to
him; but rather on the morrow, or the day after: he thus gives it away
after having made that glory his own, whatever it be--gold, a cow, a
garment, or a horse.

<span id="page_447">p. 447</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:1:33">14:1:1:33</span></span>33.
And, verily, he who either teaches or partakes of this (Pravargya),
enters that life, and that light. The observance of the rule thereof (is
as follows). Let him not cover himself (with a garment) whilst the sun
shines, lest he should be concealed from that (sun). Let him not spit
whilst the sun shines, lest he should spit upon him. Let him not
discharge urine whilst the sun shines, lest he discharge it upon him.
For so long as he shines, so great he (the sun) is: thinking, 'Lest I
should injure him by these (acts),' let him take food at night, after
striking a light, whereby it is made to be a form of him who shines
yonder. But on this point Âsuri used to say,--One rule the gods indeed
keep, to wit, the truth: let him therefore speak nothing but the truth.
