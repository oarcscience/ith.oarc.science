### FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:1">13:4:1:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati desired, 'Would that I obtained all my desires! would that I
attained all attainments!' He beheld this three days’ Soma-sacrifice,
the A*s*vamedha, and took possession of it, and sacrificed with it: by
sacrificing therewith he obtained all his desires, and attained all
attainments; and, verily, whosoever performs the A*s*vamedha sacrifice
obtains all his desires, and attains all attainments.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:2">13:4:1:2</span></span>2.
Concerning this they say, 'In what season is the beginning (to be
made)?'--'Let him begin it in summer,' say some, 'for summer is the
Kshatriya's season, and truly this--to wit, the A*s*vamedha--is the
Kshatriya's sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:3">13:4:1:3</span></span>3. But
let him rather begin it in spring; for

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

spring is the Brâhma*n*a's season, and truly whosoever sacrifices,
sacrifices after becoming, as it were, a Brâhma*n*a: let him therefore
by all means begin it in spring.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:4">13:4:1:4</span></span>4. And
six days, or seven days, before that full-moon of Phâlguna, the
officiating priests meet together--to wit, the Adhvaryu, the Hot*ri*,
the Brahman, and the Udgât*ri*; for under these <span
id="fr_891"></span>[1](#fn_887.md) the other priests are.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:5">13:4:1:5</span></span>5. The
Adhvaryu prepares for them a priest's mess of rice sufficient for four
persons: the meaning of this has been explained <span
id="fr_892"></span>[2](#fn_888.md). Four bowlfuls, four double handfuls,
four handfuls: twelvefold this is--twelve months are a year, and the
year is everything, and the A*s*vamedha is everything--thus it is in
order to his gaining and securing everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:6">13:4:1:6</span></span>6.
Those four priests eat it: the meaning of this has been explained. He
(the Sacrificer) gives to them four thousand (cows) in order to his
gaining and securing everything, for a thousand means everything, and
the A*s*vamedha is everything. And (he gives them) four gold plates
weighing a hundred (grains): the meaning of this has been
explained <span id="fr_893"></span>[3](#fn_889.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:7">13:4:1:7</span></span>7. The
Adhvaryu then, hanging a gold ornament (nishka) round him, makes him
mutter (Vâ*g*. S. XXII, 1), 'Fire thou art, light and immortality,'--for
gold, indeed, is fire, light <span id="fr_894"></span>[4](#fn_890.md), and

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

immortality: fire (fiery mettle), light (brilliance), and immortality he
thus bestows upon him;--'protector of life, protect my life!' he thereby
bestows life (vital strength) upon him. With a view to commencing the
sacrifice, he then says to him, 'Restrain thy speech!' for the sacrifice
is speech.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:8">13:4:1:8</span></span>8. Four
(of the king's) wives are in attendance--the consecrated queen, the
favourite wife, a discarded wife, and the Pâlâgalî <span
id="fr_895"></span>[1](#fn_891.md), all of them adorned and wearing gold
ornaments (neck-plates)--with the view of the completeness of conjugal
union. With them he enters the hall of the sacrificial fires--the
Sacrificer by the eastern, the wives by the southern, door.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:9">13:4:1:9</span></span>9. When
the evening-offering <span id="fr_896"></span>[2](#fn_892.md) has been
performed, he lies down with his favourite wife behind the Gârhapatya
hearth, with his head towards the north. At the same place <span
id="fr_897"></span>[3](#fn_893) the other (wives.md) also lie down. He lies
in her lap without embracing her <span id="fr_898"></span>[4](#fn_894.md),
thinking, 'May I, by this self-restraint, reach successfully the end of
the year!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:10">13:4:1:10</span></span>10.
When the morning offering has been performed, the Adhvaryu performs a
full-offering <span id="fr_899"></span>[5](#fn_895.md) with a view to his
(the Sacrificer's) gaining and securing everything, for the full means
everything, and the A*s*vamedha is everything. At this (offering) he
releases speech by (bestowing) a boon,

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

saying, 'I grant a boon to the Brahman (priest):' (this he does) with a
view to his gaining and securing everything, for a boon is everything,
and the A*s*vamedha is everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:11">13:4:1:11</span></span>11.
The gold ornament which is attached to his (neck) he then gives to the
Adhvaryu: in giving it to the Adhvaryu he secures to himself immortal
life, for gold means immortal life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:12">13:4:1:12</span></span>12.
For the object of (gaining) the road, and in order not to lose the mouth
(mukha) of the sacrifice, he then prepares an ish*t*i-offering <span
id="fr_900"></span>[1](#fn_896.md) to Agni. For, indeed, all the deities
have Agni for their mouth, and in the A*s*vamedha are (contained) all
objects of desire: 'Having, at the outset (mukha*t*a*h*), gratified all
the gods, may I obtain all my desires!' so he thinks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:13">13:4:1:13</span></span>13.
For this (offering) there are fifteen kindling-verses <span
id="fr_901"></span>[2](#fn_897.md); for fifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and
the thunderbolt means vigour: with the thunderbolt (of) vigour the
Sacrificer thus from the first repels evil. The two butter-portions
relate to the slaying of V*ri*tra <span id="fr_902"></span>[3](#fn_898.md),
with a view to the repelling of evil, for

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> V*ri*tra is evil.
\[The verses, Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 14, 15,\] 'Agni, the head, the summit of
the sky . . . <span id="fr_903"></span>[1](#fn_899.md),' and 'Be thou the
leader of the sacrifice and the realm of space (whither thou strivest
with auspicious teams: thy light-winning head hast thou raised to the
sky, and thy tongue, O Agni, hast thou made the bearer of the
offering),' pronounced in a low voice, are the anuvâkyâ and yâ*g*yâ of
the chief oblation. The one contains (the word) 'head,' the other (the
verb) 'to be,'--for the head, assuredly, is he that shines yonder: thus
it is in order to secure him (the Sun); and as to why (the other)
contains (the verb) 'to be,'--he thereby secures that which is (the
real, truly existent). The Sa*m*yâ*g*yâs <span
id="fr_904"></span>[2](#fn_900.md) are two virâ*g*-verses <span
id="fr_905"></span>[3](#fn_901.md); for that--to wit, the Virâ*g*--is the
metre

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

belonging to all the gods, and all objects of desire are (contained) in
the A*s*vamedha: 'Having gratified all the gods, may I obtain all my
desires!' so he thinks. The sacrificial fee is gold weighing a hundred
(grains): the meaning of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:14">13:4:1:14</span></span>14.
He then prepares a (pap) for Pûshan, for Pûshan is the overlord of
roads: he thus secures successful progress to the horse. But Pûshan is
also this (earth): he thus makes this (earth) its guardian, for neither
injury nor failure befals him whom this (earth) guards on the way; and
this (earth) he thus makes its guardian.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:1:15">13:4:1:15</span></span>15.
For this (offering) there are seventeen kindling-verses <span
id="fr_906"></span>[1](#fn_902.md), for the obtainment of the A*s*vamedha,
for Pra*g*âpati is seventeenfold, and the A*s*vamedha is Pra*g*âpati.
The two butter-portions are possessed of 'growth <span
id="fr_907"></span>[2](#fn_903.md),' even for the growth of the Sacrificer.
\[The verses, Vâ*g*. S. XXXIV, 41, 42,\] 'Pûshan, in thy sway we \[shall
never suffer harm, we (who) here are singers of thy praises\],' and 'The
hymn (?) lovingly composed by desire of praise hath reached

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

the guardian of every path: (may he, Pûshan, grant unto us draughts of
light (?), and fulfil our every prayer!'), pronounced in a low voice,
are the anuvâkyâ and yâ*g*yâ of the chief oblation. The one contains
(the word) 'sway,' the other (the word) 'path'; for sway is vigour:
(thus it is) in order to his gaining and securing vigour; and as to why
(the other) contains (the word) 'path,' he thereby secures successful
progress to the horse. The invitatory and offering formulas of the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t are two anush*t*ubh verses <span
id="fr_908"></span>[1](sbe44103.htm#fn_904.md); for the Anush*t*ubh is
speech, and Pra*g*âpati is speech, and the A*s*vamedha is Pra*g*âpati:
thus it is for the obtainment of the A*s*vamedha. The priests’ fee
consists of a hundred garments, for that--to wit, the garment--is man's
outward appearance, whence people (on seeing) Any well-clad man, ask,
'Who can this be? for he is perfect in his outward appearance: with
outward appearance he thus endows him. There are a hundred of them, for
man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred energies: life, and
energy, vigour, he thus gains for himself.

<span id="fn_890"></span>[348:4](sbe44102.htm#fr_894.md) Perhaps Mahîdhara
is right in taking '*s*ukram' here in the sense of 'seed' (Agner
vîrvam); cf. II, 1, 1, 5; [XIII, 1, 1, 4](sbe44074.htm#13:1:1:4.md).

<span id="fn_895"></span>[349:5](sbe44102.htm#fr_899.md) For particulars
regarding the 'pûr*n*âhuti,' or oblation of a spoonful of ghee, see part
i, p. 302, note 2.

<span id="fn_896"></span>[350:1](sbe44102.htm#fr_900.md) Viz. a cake (on
eight kapâlas) to Agni Pathik*ri*t, 'the path-maker'--or, according to
Â*s*v. *S*r. X, 6, 3, to Agni Mûrdhanvat ('forming the head,' so called
from the formulas used containing the word 'head).' For a similar
special offering to the same deity see [XII, 4, 4,
1](sbe44061.htm#12:4:4:1) (cf. [XI, 1, 5, 5](sbe44007.htm#11:1:5:5).md).

<span id="fn_897"></span>[350:2](sbe44102.htm#fr_901.md) See part i, p. 95
seqq. (especially I, 3, 5, 5-7).

<span id="fn_898"></span>[350:3](sbe44102.htm#fr_902.md) The two
Â*g*yabhâgas, or butter-portions to Agni and Soma, are said to be
'V*ri*tra-slaying' (vârtraghna), or to relate to the slaying of
V*ri*tra, when their anuvâkyâs, or invitatory formulas, are the two
verses *Ri*g-veda VI, 16, 34 (agnir v*ri*trâ*n*i gaṅghanat, 'May Agni
slay the V*ri*tras'), and I, 91, 5 (tva*m* so*m*âsi satpatis tva*m*
râ*g*ota v*ri*trahâ, 'Thou, O Soma, art the true lord, thou art the king
and the slayer of V*ri*tra,' &c.). This is the case at the Full-moon
sacrifice, whilst at the New-moon sacrifice the two butter-portions
<span id="page_351">p. 351</span> are said to be 'v*ri*dhanvant,' or
'relating to growth,' because the anuvâkyâs used on that occasion are
two verses containing forms of the root v*ri*dh, 'to grow,' viz. VIII,
44, 12 (agni*h* pratnena manmanâ . . . kavir vipre*n*a vâv*ri*dhe, 'Agni
has grown strong by the old hymn,--as the wise one by the priest') and
I, 91, 11 (Soma gîrbhish *t*vâ vaya*m* vardhayâmo va*k*ovida*h* . . .,
'O Soma, we magnify thee (make thee grow) by our songs, skilful in
speech'). In the same way the one or the other form is used in different
ish*t*is. At I, 6, 2, 12, the translation, 'the two butter-portions
should be offered to the V*ri*tra-slayer (Indra)' should therefore be
altered to 'the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of V*ri*tra'
(or, 'are V*ri*tra-slaying').

<span id="fn_899"></span>[351:1](sbe44102.htm#fr_903.md) See VII, 4, 1, 41.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[351:2](sbe44102.htm#fr_904.md) That is, the two
formulas used with the oblation to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[351:3](sbe44102.htm#fr_905.md) Whilst the normal
performance of an ish*t*i requires two trish*t*ubh-verses (*Ri*g-veda X,
2, I; VI, 15, 14; cf. part i, p. 202, notes 2 and 3) for the invitatory
and offering formulas of the oblations to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t, two
virâ*g*-verses are frequently prescribed, certain verses of the
Virâ*g*-hymn *Ri*g-veda VII, 1, being chiefly used for this purpose; e.
g. v. 3 as the anuvâkyâ, and v. 18 as the yâ*g*yâ for the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t of the oblation to Aditi at the <span id="page_352">p.
352</span> Âdhâna (see part i, p. 307, note 3). and the
Dîksha*n*îyesh*t*i; and vv. 14, 15 as yâ*g*yâ and anuvâkyâ of the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t of the Prâya*n*îyesh*t*i. It is doubtless the two former
verses, commonly employed at special ish*t*is (cf. part i, p. 164, note
3), which are to be used on the present occasion.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[352:1](sbe44102.htm#fr_906.md) See part i, p.
112, note 1.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[352:2](sbe44102.htm#fr_907.md) That is, they are
performed with two invitatory formulas containing the verb 'to grow,'
see [p. 350](#page_350), note [3](#fn_898.md). Whilst our Brâhma*n*a thus
prescribes the two invitatory formulas used for the butter-portions of
the New-moon sacrifice, Â*s*valâyana (*S*r. X, 6, 6) prescribes two
verses containing the verb 'as' (or 'bhû'), viz. *Ri*g-veda V, 13, 4,
tvam agne saprathâ asi; and I, 92, 9, soma yâs to mayobhuva ûtaya*h*
santi dâ*s*ushe tâbhir no<sup>ऽ</sup>vitâ bhava.
