### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:4:1">12:3:4:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati once upon a time spake unto Purusha

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nârâya*n*a, 'Offer
sacrifice! offer sacrifice!' He spake, 'Verily, thou sayest to me,
"Offer sacrifice! offer sacrifice!" and thrice have I offered sacrifice:
by the morning-service the Vasus went forth, by the midday-service the
Rudras, and by the evening-service the Âdityas; now I have but the
offering-place <span id="fr_498"></span>[1](#fn_498.md), and on the
offering-place I am sitting.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:4:2">12:3:4:2</span></span>2. He
spake, 'Offer yet sacrifice! I will tell thee such a thing that thy
hymns shall be strung as a pearl on a thread, or a thread through a
pearl.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:4:3">12:3:4:3</span></span>3. And
he spake thus unto him, ‘At the (chanting of the) Bahishpavamâna, at the
morning-service, thou shalt hold on to the Udgât*ri* from behind,
saying, "Thou art a falcon formed of the Gâyatrî metre,--I hold on to
thee: bear me unto well-being!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:4:4">12:3:4:4</span></span>4. ‘And
at the midday Pavamâna thou shalt hold on to the Udgât*ri* from behind,
saying, "Thou art an eagle formed of the Trish*t*ubh metre,--I hold on
to thee: bear me unto well-being! "

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:4:5">12:3:4:5</span></span>5. ‘And
at the Ârbhava-pavamâna, at the evening-service, thou shalt hold on to
the Udgât*ri* from behind, saying, "Thou art a *Ri*bhu formed of the
*G*agat metre,--I hold on to thee: bear me unto well-being!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:4:6">12:3:4:6</span></span>6. 'And
at the close of each pressing thou shalt mutter, "In me be light, in me
might, in me glory, in me everything!"'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:4:7">12:3:4:7</span></span>7. Now
light, indeed, is this (terrestrial) world, might the air-world, glory
the heavens, and what other worlds there are, they are everything
(else).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:4:8">12:3:4:8</span></span>8. And
light, indeed, is Agni, might Vâyu (the

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

wind), glory Âditya (the sun), and what other gods there are they are
everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:4:9">12:3:4:9</span></span>9. And
light, indeed, is the *Ri*g-veda, might the Ya*g*ur-vela, glory the
Sâma-veda, and what other Vedas there are they are everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:4:10">12:3:4:10</span></span>10.
And light, indeed, is speech, might the breath, glory the eye, and what
other vital airs there are they are everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:4:11">12:3:4:11</span></span>11.
Let him know this:--'All the worlds have I placed within mine own self,
and mine own self have I placed within all the worlds; all the gods have
I placed within mine own self, and mine own self have I placed within
all the gods; all the Vedas have I placed within mine own self, and mine
own self have I placed within all the Vedas; all the vital airs have I
placed within mine own self, and mine own self have I placed within the
vital airs.' For imperishable, indeed, are the worlds, imperishable the
gods, imperishable the Vedas, imperishable the vital airs, imperishable
is the All: and, verily, whosoever thus knows this, passes from the
imperishable unto the imperishable, conquers recurrent death, and
attains the full measure of life.
