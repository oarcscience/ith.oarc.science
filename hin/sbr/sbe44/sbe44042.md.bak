Verily, there are four kinds of fire,--the one laid down, the one taken
out, the one taken forward, and the one spread (over the three hearths).
Now, that which is laid down is this very (terrestrial) world; that
which is taken out is the air-world, that which is taken forward is the
sky, and that which is spread is the regions. And that which is laid
down is Agni, that which is taken out is Vâyu (the wind), that which is
taken forward is Âditya (the sun), and that which is spread is
*K*andramas (the moon). And that which is laid down is the Gârhapatya,
that which is taken out is the Âhavanîya, that which is taken forward is
the (fire) they lead forth eastwards from the Âhavanîya; and that which
is spread is the one they take northwards for the cooking of the victim,
and that (used) for the by-offerings <span

sacrifice on a fire taken forward.
