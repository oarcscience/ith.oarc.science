There are five great sacrifices, and they, indeed, are great sacrificial sessions,--to wit, the sacrifice to beings, the sacrifice to men, the sacrifice to the Fathers, the sacrifice to the gods, and the sacrifice to the Brahman.</p>

The sacrifice to the Brahman is one's own (daily) study (of the Veda). The <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;-spoon of this same sacrifice to the Brahman is speech, its upabh<I>ri</I>t the mind, its dhruv&acirc; the eye, its sruva mental power, its purificatory bath truth, its conclusion heaven. And, verily, however great the world he gains by giving away (to the priests) this earth replete with wealth, thrice that and more--an imperishable world does he gain, whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day his lesson (of the Veda): therefore let him study his daily lesson.</p>

More likely, however, such special sciences as the 'sarpavidy&acirc;' (science of snakes) are referred to; cf. <a href="sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:9">XIII, 4, 3, 9</A> seqq.</P>

S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, in the first place, takes the two as one, meaning 'stanzas (or verses) telling about men;' but he then refers to the interpretation by others, according to which the G&acirc;th&acirc;s are such verses as that about 'the great snake driven from the lake' (<a href="sbe44029.htm#11:5:5:8">XI, 5, 5, 8</A>); whilst the N&acirc;r&acirc;<I>s</I>a<I>m</I>s&icirc;s would be (verses 'telling about men') such as that regarding <I>G</I>aname<I>g</I>aya and his horses (<a href="sbe44029.htm#11:5:5:12">XI, 5, 5, 12</A>).
