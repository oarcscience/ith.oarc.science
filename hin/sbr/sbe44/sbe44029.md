### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE *S*ATÂTIRÂ*T*RAM, OR SACRIFICIAL SESSION OF A HUNDRED ATIRÂTRA-SACRIFICES.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:5:1">11:5:5:1</span></span>1. Now,
when the gods were passing upwards to the world of heaven, the Asuras
enveloped them in darkness. They spake, 'Verily, by nothing else save a
sacrificial session is there any way of dispelling this (darkness):
well, then, let us perform a sacrificial session!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:5:2">11:5:5:2</span></span>2. They
entered upon a sacrificial session of a hundred Agnish*t*oma (days), and
dispelled the darkness as far as one may see whilst sitting; and in like
manner did they, by (a session of) a hundred Ukthya (days), dispel the
darkness as far as one may see whilst standing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:5:3">11:5:5:3</span></span>3. They
spake, 'We do indeed dispel the darkness, but not the whole of it: come,
let us resort to Father Pra*g*âpati.' Having come to Father Pra*g*âpati,
they spake, 'Reverend sir, when we were passing upwards to the world of
heaven the Asuras enveloped us in darkness.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:5:4">11:5:5:4</span></span>4. 'We
entered upon a sacrificial session of a hundred Agnish*t*omas, and
dispelled the darkness as far as one may see whilst sitting; and in like
manner did we dispel the darkness as far as one may see whilst standing:
do thou teach us, reverend sir, how, by dispelling the Asuras and
darkness, and all evil, we shall find (the way to) the world of heaven!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:5:5">11:5:5:5</span></span>5. He
spake, 'Surely, ye proceeded by means of two sacrifices, the
Agnish*t*oma and Ukthya, which do not contain all Soma-rites <span
id="fr_294"></span>[1](#fn_294.md);--enter ye upon

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

a sacrificial session of a hundred Atirâtras: when ye have thereby
repelled the Asuras and darkness, and all evil, ye shall find the world
of heaven.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:5:6">11:5:5:6</span></span>6. They
entered upon a sacrificial session of a hundred Atirâtras; and, having
thereby repelled the Asuras and darkness, and all evil, they found (the
way to) the world of heaven. In their first fifty days <span
id="fr_295"></span>[1](#fn_295.md) the night-hymns reached into the day,
and the day-hymns into the night.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:5:7">11:5:5:7</span></span>7. They
spake, 'Verily, we have got into confusion and know not what to do:
come, let us resort to Father Pra*g*âpati!' Having come to Father
Pra*g*âpati, they spake (the verses), 'Our night-hymns are (chanted) in
daytime, and those of the day at night: O sage, being learned and wise,
teach thou us who are ignorant (how to perform) the sacrifices!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:5:8">11:5:5:8</span></span>8. He
then recited to them as follows, 'A stronger, pursuing, has, as it were,
driven a great snake from its own place, the lake: therefore the
sacrificial session is not carried through.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:5:9">11:5:5:9</span></span>9. 'For
your Â*s*vina (*s*astra), being recited, has indeed driven the
morning-litany from its place <span id="fr_296"></span>[2](#fn_296.md).'--

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'What ye, being
wise, have unwise-like driven from its place, take ye up that gently
through the Pra*s*âst*ri*, reciting so as not to disturb <span
id="fr_297"></span>[1](#fn_297) (the Hot*ri*.md).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:5:10">11:5:5:10</span></span>10.
They spake, 'How, then, reverend sir, is (the Â*s*vina-*s*astra
properly) recited and how is the recitation not disturbed?' He spake,
'When the Hot*ri*, in reciting the Â*s*vina-*s*astra, reaches the end of
the Gâyatra metre of the Âgneya-kratu <span
id="fr_298"></span>[2](#fn_298.md), the Pratiprasthât*ri* <span
id="fr_299"></span>[3](#fn_299.md) should carry round the Vasatîvarî
water <span id="fr_300"></span>[4](#fn_300.md), and bespeak the
Prâtar-anuvâka for the Maitrâvaru*n*a (seated) between the two
Havirdhâna (carts containing the offering-material). The Hot*ri* recites
(the Â*s*vina-*s*astra) in a loud voice, and the other (the
Maitrâvaru*n*a) repeats (the morning-litany) in a low voice, only just
muttering it: in this

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

way he does not run counter to (the Hot*ri*'s) speech by (his own)
speech, nor metre by metre.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:5:11">11:5:5:11</span></span>11.
'When the Prâtar-anuvâka has been completed, he (the Pratiprasthât*ri*),
having offered, at their proper time <span
id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_301.md), the Upâ*ms*u and Antaryâma cups <span
id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_302.md), presses out the straining-cloth and
puts it in the Dro*n*akala*s*a <span id="fr_303"></span>[3](#fn_303.md).
And when ye have performed the (offering of the cups of) fermented
Soma <span id="fr_304"></span>[4](#fn_304), and returned (to the Sadas.md),
ye should drink the fermented Soma (remaining in those cups). Having
then, in the proper form, completed the "tail of the sacrifice," and
taken up the cups of Soma (drawn) subsequent to the Antaryâma <span
id="fr_305"></span>[5](#fn_305.md), and offered the oblation of drops <span
id="fr_306"></span>[6](#fn_306.md), as well as the Santani-oblation <span
id="fr_307"></span>[7](#fn_307.md), ye should perform the Bahishpavamâna
chant, and enter upon the day (-performance).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:5:12">11:5:5:12</span></span>12.
Concerning this there are these verses:--With four harnessed Saindhava
(steeds) the sages left behind them the gloom--the wise gods who spun
out the session of a hundred sacrifices.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:5:13">11:5:5:13</span></span>13.
In this (sacrificial session) there are, indeed, four harnessed
(steeds),--to wit, two Hot*ri*s and two Adhvaryus.--'Like unto the
artificer contriving spikes to the spear, the sages coupled the ends of

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

two days: now the Dânavas, we know <span
id="fr_308"></span>[1](#fn_308.md), will not disorder the sacrificial
thread of them stretched out by us.--They leave undone the work of the
previous day, and carry it through on the following day,--difficult to
be understood. is the wisdom of the deities: streams of Soma flow,
interlinked with streams of Soma!--Even as they constantly sprinkle the
equal prize-winning <span id="fr_309"></span>[2](#fn_309.md) steeds, so
(they pour out) the cups full of fiery liquor in the palace of
*G*aname*g*aya.' Then the Asura-Rakshas went away.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_294"></span>[91:1](sbe44029.htm#fr_294.md) Viz. neither the
Sho*d*a*s*in which, to (the twelve stotras, and <span id="page_92">p.
92</span>*s*astras of the Agnish*t*oma, and) the fifteen chants, of the
Ukthya, adds a sixteenth; and the Atirâtra which has thirteen additional
chants (and recitations), viz. three nocturnal rounds of four chants
each, and one twilight-chant, followed by the Â*s*vina-*s*astra, recited
by the Hot*ri*. No account is here taken of either the Atyagnish*t*oma
of thirteen chants, or the Aptoryâma, which, to those of the Atirâtra,
adds four more chants. Cf. part ii, p. 397, note 2.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[92:1](sbe44029.htm#fr_295.md) Or, perhaps,
rather, in their days prior to the fiftieth (arvâkpâ*ñk*â*s*eshv
aha*h*su), St. Petersb. Dict.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[92:2](sbe44029.htm#fr_296.md) The
Â*s*vina-*s*astra, with the recitation of which, by the Hot*ri*, the
Atirâtra concludes, takes the place, and is, indeed, <span
id="page_93">p. 93</span> merely a modification, of the Prâtar-anuvâka,
or morning-litany (see part ii, p. 229, note 2), by which an ordinary
Soma-sacrifice is ushered in. Like it, its chief portion consists of
three sections, termed kratu, of hymns and detached verses addressed to
the 'early-coming' deities, Agni, Ushas and the two A*s*vins. The whole
is to consist of not less than a thousand B*ri*hatîs, that is to say,
the whole matter is to amount to at least 36,000 syllables. For a full
account of this *S*astra, see Haug's Transl. of Ait. Br., p. 268.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[93:1](sbe44029.htm#fr_297.md) Whilst the Hot*ri*
is reciting the Â*s*vina-sastra, his first assistant, the Pra*s*âst*ri*
(or, as he is more commonly called, the Maitrâvaru*n*a), is to repeat
the Prâtar-anuvâka in a low voice.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[93:2](sbe44029.htm#fr_298.md) The hymns and
detached verses of each of the three sections--the Âgneya-, Ushasya- and
Â*s*vina-kratu--of the Â*s*vina-*s*astra (as of the Prâtar-anuvâka) are
arranged according to the seven principal metres--gâyatrî, anush*t*ubh,
trish*t*ubh, b*ri*hatî, ush*n*ih, *g*agatî, and paṅkti--forming as many
subdivisions of the three sections.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[93:3](sbe44029.htm#fr_299.md) That is, the first
assistant of the Adhvaryu priest; the latter having to respond
(pratigara) to the Hot*ri*'s calls (see part ii, p. 326, note 1) at the
beginning and end of the *S*astra, and to sit through the recitations
(III, 9, 3, 11).

<span id="fn_300"></span>[93:4](sbe44029.htm#fr_300.md) See III, 9, 2, 13
seqq.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[94:1](sbe44029.htm#fr_301.md) Yathâyatanam eva
prak*ri*tau yasmin kâle hûyeta tathaiva hutvâ, Sây.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[94:2](sbe44029.htm#fr_302.md) See IV, 1, 1, 22
seqq.; 1, 2, 21 seqq.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[94:3](sbe44029.htm#fr_303.md) See II, 1, 2, 3,
with note thereon.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[94:4](sbe44029.htm#fr_304.md) That is, having,
after the completion of the Â*s*vina-*s*astra, offered to the A*s*vins
some of the Soma that has been standing 'over the previous day.'

<span id="fn_305"></span>[94:5](sbe44029.htm#fr_305.md) Viz. the
Aindravâyava, Maitrâvaru*n*a, &c., see IV, I, 3, 1 seqq.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[94:6](sbe44029.htm#fr_306.md) See IV, 2, 5, 1
seqq.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[94:7](sbe44029.htm#fr_307.md) Called
'savanasantani' (? i.e. continuity of pressing) by Kâty., XXIV, 4, 1.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[95:1](sbe44029.htm#fr_308.md) Sâya*n*a
construes,--we know the extended sacrificial thread of these (days); and
the Dânavas (Asuras) do not henceforth confound us. In that case the
order of words would be extremely irregular.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[95:2](sbe44029.htm#fr_309.md)
Kâsh*th*abh*ri*ta*h*, â*g*yantâ (!) kâsh*th*âni tâni bihhratîti
kâsh*th*abh*ri*ta*h* svâdasa*m* (? *kh*ândasa*m*) pûrvapadasya
hrasvatvam, â*g*idhâvana*m* k*ri*tavato hayân a*s*vân, Sây. According to
this authority the general meaning of the verse is that even as the
(king's) horses, when they have performed their task, have sweet drinks
poured out on (? to) them, and thus obtain their hearts’ desire, so the
gods, by performing a sacrificial session of a hundred Atirâtras, in
accordance with Pra*g*âpati's directions, dispel the darkness and gain
the world of heaven.
