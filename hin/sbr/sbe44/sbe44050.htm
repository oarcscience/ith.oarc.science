<P><A NAME="fn_445"></A><A HREF="sbe44050.htm#fr_445">148:1</A> The difference between the Abhiplava-sha<I>d</I>aha and the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya-sha<I>d</I>aha was thus explained in part iii, introd., p. xxi, note 2:--'In both kinds of sha<I>d</I>aha, the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotras (at the M&acirc;dhyandina-savana) are performed in the ordinary way--viz. either in the Agnish<I>t</I>oma or the Ukthya way (see ib., p. xvi, note 2, as the correct reference is);--but whilst, in the Abhiplava-sha<I>d</I>aha, the Rathantara and B<I>ri</I>hat-s&acirc;mans are used for the Hot<I>ri</I>'s P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra on alternate days, the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya-sha<I>d</I>aha requires a different P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-s&acirc;man on each of the six days. The two kinds of sha<I>d</I>ahas also differ entirely in regard to the sequence of Stomas prescribed for the performance of the Stotras.' It is this difference in the 'sequence of Stomas' which is referred to in our passage. On the six days of the Abhiplava-sha<I>d</I>aha, the sequence of Stomas (the first four of which, viz. Triv<I>ri</I>t, Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a, Saptada<I>s</I>a, and Ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a, are only used) varies from day to day in this way: 1. <I>G</I>yotish<I>t</I>oma; 2. Gosh<I>t</I>oma; 3. &Acirc;yush<I>t</I>oma; 4. Gosh<I>t</I>oma; 5. &Acirc;yush<I>t</I>oma; 6. <I>G</I>yotish<I>t</I>oma (for the difference between these, see part iv, p. 287, note 2). It will thus be seen that the Abhiplava has the '<I>g</I>yotih (stoma)' on both sides, on the first and the last days. For the Hot<I>ri</I>'s P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra on these successive days the Rathantara-s&acirc;man and B<I>ri</I>hat-s&acirc;man are used; and, as the Gosh<I>t</I>oma and &Acirc;yush<I>t</I>oma are Ukthya-days, the usual practice which requires the B<I>ri</I>hat-s&acirc;man for such days, is not followed; just as the final <I>G</I>yotish<I>t</I>oma in this case requires the B<I>ri</I>hat-s&acirc;man.--As regards the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya-sha<I>d</I>aha, each successive day requires for its stotras a single Stoma, in the ascending order: Triv<I>ri</I>t, Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a, Saptada<I>s</I>a, Ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a, Tri<I>n</I>ava, Trayastri<I>m</I><I>s</I>a;--a different P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-s&acirc;man being used for the Hot<I>ri</I>'s P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra <A NAME="page_149"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 149</FONT></A> on each of the six days. Here only the first day has the same Stoma at the beginning, as the <I>G</I>yotish<I>t</I>oma,--whence it has '<I>g</I>yotis' on one side only.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_446"></A><A HREF="sbe44050.htm#fr_446">149:1</A> This 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>yapratish<I>th</I>ite' looks rather strange,--perhaps the correct reading is 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>apratish<I>th</I>ite,' 'established on the p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-s&acirc;mans'; unless, indeed, 'pratish<I>th</I>ita' has to be understood here to refer to the Abhiplava, as the established, or ordinary, Sha<I>d</I>aha, which doubtless would make the best sense,--'those two wheels of the gods, the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya and the established (Abhiplava-) sha<I>d</I>aha.'</P>

The St. Petersb. <A NAME="page_150"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 150</FONT></A> Dict., on the other hand, takes 'tantra' here in the sense of 'model form, type,'--and, indeed, the one meaning constantly passes into the other. The MS. of the comm. is too corrupt to be of much use.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_449"></A><A HREF="sbe44050.htm#fr_449">150:1</A> This is a doubtful rendering of 'ekoti.' Though, doubtless, the juxtaposition of 'ekoti' and 'sam&acirc;nam &ucirc;tim' cannot be accidental, the word '&ucirc;ti' may probably have a different derivation and meaning in the two occurrences.

<P><A NAME="fn_450"></A><A HREF="sbe44050.htm#fr_450">150:2</A> During five complete months of the first half, and four complete months of the second half, of the year four Abhiplava-sha<I>d</I>ahas and one P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya-sha<I>d</I>aha are performed. Now, the six clays of the Abhiplava-sha<I>d</I>aha consist of 1. Agnish<I>t</I>oma; 2-5. Ukthyas; 6. Agnish<I>t</I>oma; and those of the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya-sha<I>d</I>aha of 1.

<P><A NAME="fn_451"></A><A HREF="sbe44050.htm#fr_451">150:3</A> The reason why the Sun is so often referred to as the twenty-first or twenty-one-fold, is not easy to discover. Possibly it may be from the fact that the Vishuvat day, or central day of the great session and the longest day of the year, is identified with the Sun, <A NAME="page_151"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 151</FONT></A> and that this day is flanked on both sides by ten special days which together with the central day, form a special group of twenty-one days. But, on the other hand, it may be exactly the other way, viz. that this central group was made one of twenty-one nays because of the already recognised epithet of &Acirc;ditya as the 'ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a.' Cf. A. Hillebrandt, Die Sonnwendfeste in Alt-Indien, p. 6 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_452"></A><A HREF="sbe44050.htm#fr_452">151:1</A> Here the twenty-one Ukthyas are symbolically identified with the twenty-one-versed hymn-form; and the nine Agnish<I>t</I>omas (of <a href="sbe44050.htm#12:2:2:5">paragraph 5</A>) with the B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; metre which consists of four p&acirc;das of nine syllables each.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_453"></A><A HREF="sbe44050.htm#fr_453">151:2</A> This number is evidently arrived at by counting the twenty Ukthyas as Agnish<I>t</I>omas (hence 9 + 20), and adding thereto five more Agnish<I>t</I>omas obtained by the calculation referred to in paragraph 12 (see note thereon), according to which the characteristic Stotras and Sastras of the Ukthya make one additional Agnish<I>t</I>oma in every four Ukthyas. The Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in, thus, is not taken into account in this calculation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_454"></A><A HREF="sbe44050.htm#fr_454">152:1</A> Besides the Rathantara and B<I>ri</I>hat, used on alternate days for the Hot<I>ri</I>'s P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra at the Abhiplava, the V&acirc;madevya and K&acirc;leya-s&acirc;mans, used on each day for the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a's and A<I>k</I><I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka's P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotras, seem to be counted here as making up the four P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-s&acirc;mans of the Abhiplava-sha<I>d</I>aha. For the four Stomas, see <A HREF="sbe44049.htm#page_148">p. 148</A>, note.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_456"></A><A HREF="sbe44050.htm#fr_456">152:3</A> The 'iva' would seem here (as, indeed, pretty frequently) to have the meaning of 'eva,' 'indeed,' thus--coming considerably after (the gods). Cf. Ait.-Br&acirc;hm. IV, 17, 5, where the A&#7749;giras are said to have reached heaven sixty years after the &Acirc;dityas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_457"></A><A HREF="sbe44050.htm#fr_457">152:4</A> This etymology is of course not meant to be taken seriously, the word 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya' being derived from 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a,' 'back' (<a href="sbe44048.htm#12:1:4:1">XII, 1, 4, 1</A>).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_461"></A><A HREF="sbe44050.htm#fr_461">153:4</A> Whilst the Agnish<I>t</I>oma includes twelve Stotras and twelve <I>S</I>astras, the Ukthya-sacrifice has three additional (Uktha-) Stotras and Sastras, which in the four Ukthya days of the Abhiplava-sha<I>d</I>aha make up another twelve chants and twelve recitations.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_464"></A><A HREF="sbe44050.htm#fr_464">154:1</A> In the scheme of the Gav&acirc;m ayanam, given above (<A HREF="sbe44046.htm#page_139">p. 139</A>, note <A HREF="sbe44046.htm#fn_425">1</A>), there is one day in excess of the year, viz. either the central Vishuvat day (<a href="sbe44051.htm#12:2:3:6">XII, 2, 3, 6</A>) or the final Atir&acirc;tra; but by making this latter day identical with the opening Atir&acirc;tra, Udd&acirc;laka would seem to bring the whole within the compass of one year of six seasons. In the next paragraph, on the other hand, the same result is obtained by the identification of the second and the last but one days of the session. Another, and perhaps more probable, explanation of Udd&acirc;laka's calculation would, however, be this. In the scheme of the sacrificial session there occur, as not included in the different sacrificial groups or periods (the sha<I>d</I>ahas, svaras&acirc;mans, &amp;c.), seven special days--the opening and final Atir&acirc;tras, the <I>K</I>aturvi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a and Mah&acirc;vrata days, and the Abhi<I>g</I>it, Vishuvat, and Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it days. These seven days he here successively reduces to six and five days. The further reduction of this number by the identification of the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya and Abhiplava, as well as of the Svaras&acirc;man days, requires no explanation. Cf., however, the Addenda.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_466"></A><A HREF="sbe44050.htm#fr_466">155:1</A> Prof. Oldenberg (Zeitschr. d. Deutschen Morg. Ges., vol. 50, p. 460) takes 'upanishad' in the sense of 'worship'--'this is the worship to be offered to the year.' Perhaps 'meditation' might be the more appropriate rendering:--'this is the form in which the year should be meditated upon.' Cf. X, 4, 5, 1; 5, I, 1.</P>
