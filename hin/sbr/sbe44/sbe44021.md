### FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:1">11:4:1:1</span></span>1. Now
Uddâlaka Âru*n*i <span id="fr_190"></span>[3](#fn_190.md) was driving
about <span id="fr_191"></span>[4](#fn_191.md), as a chosen
(offering-priest), amongst the people of

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

the northern country. By him a gold coin was offered; for in the time of
our forefathers a prize used to be offered by chosen (priests) when
driving about, for the sake of calling out the timid <span
id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_192.md) to a disputation. Fear then seized the
Brâhma*n*as of the northern people:--

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:2">11:4:1:2</span></span>2.
'This fellow is a Kurupa*ñk*âla Brahman, and son of a Brahman--let us
take care lest he should deprive us of our domain: come, let us
challenge him to a disputation on spiritual matters.'--'With whom for
our champion?'--'With Svaidâyana.' Svaidâyana, to wit, was *S*aunaka.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:3">11:4:1:3</span></span>3. They
said, 'Svaidâyana, with thee as our champion we will fight this fellow.'
He said, 'Well, then, stay ye here quietly: I will just make his
acquaintance <span id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_193.md).' He went up to him,
and when he had come up, he (Uddâlaka) greeted him saying,

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
'Svaidâyana!'--'Halloo, son of Gautama!' replied the other, and
straightway, began to question him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:4">11:4:1:4</span></span>4. 'He
alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as chosen
(offering-priest), who knows in the Full and New-moon sacrifices eight
butter-portions (offered) previously, five portions of sacrificial food
in the middle, six (portions) of Pra*g*âpati, and eight butter-portions
(offered) subsequently.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:5">11:4:1:5</span></span>5. 'He
alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as chosen
(priest), who knows from the Full and New-moon sacrifices <span
id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_194.md) whereby it is that creatures here are
born toothless, whereby they (the teeth) grow with them, whereby they
decay with them, whereby they come to remain permanently with them;
whereby, in the last stage of life, they all decay again with them;
whereby the lower ones grow first, then the upper ones; whereby the
lower ones are smaller, and the upper ones broader; whereby the incisors
are larger, and whereby the molars are of equal size.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:6">11:4:1:6</span></span>6. 'He
alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as chosen
(priest), who knows from the Full and New-moon sacrifices, whereby
creatures here are born with hair; whereby, for the second time, as it
were, the hair of the beard and the arm-pits and other parts of the
body <span id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_195.md) grow on them; whereby it is
on the head that one first

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

becomes grey, and then, again, in the last stage of life, one becomes
grey all over.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:7">11:4:1:7</span></span>7. 'He
alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as chosen
(priest), who knows from the Full and New-moon sacrifices whereby the
seed of the boy is not productive, whereby in his middle age it is
productive, and whereby again in his last stage of life it is not
productive;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:8">11:4:1:8</span></span>8. 'And
he who knows the golden, brilliant-winged Gâyatrî who bears the
Sacrificer to the heavenly world.' Then he (Uddâlaka) gave up to him the
gold coin, saying, 'Thou art learned, Svaidâyana; and, verily, gold is
given unto him who knows gold;' and he (Svaidâyana), having concealed
it <span id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_196.md), went away. They asked him,
'How did that son of Gautama behave?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:9">11:4:1:9</span></span>9. He
said, 'Even as a Brahman, and the son of a Brahman: the head would fly
off of whosoever should (dare to) challenge him to a disputation <span
id="fr_197"></span>[2](#fn_197.md).' They then went away in all directions.
He (Uddâlaka) then came back to him, with fire-wood

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

in his hand <span id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_198.md), and said, 'I want to
become thy pupil.'--'What wouldst thou study?'--'Even those questions
which thou didst ask me--explain them to me!' He said, 'I will tell them
to thee even without thy becoming my pupil.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:10">11:4:1:10</span></span>10.
And he then spoke thus to him:--The two libations of ghee, the five
fore-offerings, and, eighth, Agni's butter-portion--these are the eight
butter-portions (offered) previously. Soma's butter-portion, being the
first of the portions of sacrificial food--for Soma is sacrificial
food,---Agni's cake, Agni-Soma's low-voiced offering, Agni-Soma's cake,
and (the offering to) Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t--these are the five portions
of sacrificial food in the middle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:11">11:4:1:11</span></span>11.
The fore-portion, the I*d*â, what he hands to the Agnîdh <span
id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_199.md), the Brahman's portion, the Sacrificer's
portion, and the Anvâhârya (mess of rice)--these are the six (portions)
of Pra*g*âpati. The three after-offerings, the four Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as,
and, eighth, the Samish*t*aya*g*us--these are the eight butter-portions
(offered) subsequently.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:12">11:4:1:12</span></span>12.
And inasmuch as the fore-offerings are without invitatory formulas <span
id="fr_200"></span>[3](#fn_200.md), therefore creatures are horn here
without teeth; and inasmuch as the chief oblations have invitatory
formulas, therefore they (the teeth) grow in them; and inasmuch as the
after-offerings are without invitatory formulas, therefore they (the
teeth) decay in them; and inasmuch as the Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as as have
invitatory formulas,

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

therefore they (the teeth) come to remain permanently with them; and
inasmuch as the Samish*t*aya*g*us is without invitatory formula,
therefore they all decay again in the last stage of life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:13">11:4:1:13</span></span>13.
And inasmuch as, after uttering the invitatory formula, he offers with
the offering-formula, therefore the lower (teeth) grow first, then the
upper ones; and inasmuch as, after uttering a gâyatrî verse as
invitatory formula, he offers with a trish*t*ubh verse <span
id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_201), therefore the lower (teeth.md) are
smaller, and the upper ones broader; and inasmuch as he pours out the
two libations of ghee in a forward direction <span
id="fr_202"></span>[2](#fn_202.md), therefore the incisors are larger; and
inasmuch as the two sa*m*yâ*g*yâs <span id="fr_203"></span>[3](#fn_203.md)
are in the same metre, therefore the molars are of equal size.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:14">11:4:1:14</span></span>14.
And inasmuch as he spreads a cover of sacrificial grass (on the Vedi),
therefore creatures here are born with hair; and inasmuch as he for the
second time, as it were, spreads the Prastara-bunch <span
id="fr_204"></span>[4](#fn_204.md), therefore, for the second time, as it
were, the hair of the beard and the arm-pits, and other parts of the
body grow; and inasmuch as at first he only throws the Prastara-bunch
after (the oblations into the fire), therefore it is on the head that
one first becomes grey; and inasmuch as he then throws after it all the
sacrificial grass of the altar-ground, therefore,

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

in the last stage of life, one again becomes grey all over.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:15">11:4:1:15</span></span>15.
And inasmuch as the fore-offerings have ghee for their
offering-material, a boy's seed is not productive, but is like water,
for ghee is like water; and inasmuch as, in the middle of the sacrifice,
they sacrifice with sour curds <span id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_205.md) and
with cake, therefore it is productive in his middle stage of life, for
thick-flowing, as it were, is (that havis), and thick-flowing, as it
were, is seed; and inasmuch as the after-offerings have ghee for their
offering-material, it again is not productive in his last stage of life,
and is like water, for ghee, indeed, is like water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:1:16">11:4:1:16</span></span>16.
The Vedi (altar-ground), doubtless, is the Gâyatrî: the eight
butter-portions (offered) previously are her right wing, and the eight
butter-portions (offered) subsequently are her left wing: that same
golden, brilliant-winged Gâyatrî, indeed, bears the Sacrificer who knows
this to the heavenly world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_190"></span>[50:3](sbe44021.htm#fr_190.md) For another version
of this legend see Gopatha-Brâhma*n*a I, 3, 6. See also Prof. Geldner's
translation in Pischel and G.'s Vedische Studien II, p. 185.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[50:4](sbe44021.htm#fr_191.md) Prof. Geldner takes
'dhâvayâ*m* *k*akâra' in a causal sense <span id="page_51">p. 51</span>,
'er verursachte einen Anflauf' (he caused people to crowd together, or
to come to him in crowds). Sâya*n*a, however, takes it in the same sense
as we have. done,--ârtvi*g*yâya v*ri*ta*h* sann udagde*s*ân *g*agâma.
The Gopatha-Br., further on, has the remark 'sa vai gotamasya putra
ûrdhva*m* v*ri*to<sup>ऽ</sup>dhâvît' (!).

<span id="fn_192"></span>[51:1](sbe44021.htm#fr_192.md) It is by no means
certain whether the interpretation of the paragraph as here adapted is
the right one. Prof. Geldner takes it thus,--'He (Udd.) had taken a gold
piece with him; for in times of old the chosen (priests) who caused a
crowd to gather round them, used to take a single gold piece with them
with a view to their proposing a riddle (or problem) whenever they were
afraid.' The Gopatha-Br. has a different reading, which is likewise far
from clear:--tasya ha nishka upâhito babhûva, upavâdâd bibhyato yo ma
brâhma*n*o<sup>ऽ</sup>nû*k*âna upavadishyati tasmâ etam
pradâsyâmîti;--by him a gold coin was offered (? by him a gold plate had
been put on, i.e. was worn round the neck) being afraid of obloquy (?):
'I shall give this to any learned Brahman who will speak up against me,'
thus (he thought).

<span id="fn_193"></span>[51:2](sbe44021.htm#fr_193.md) Or, I'll just find
out what kind of man he is.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[52:1](sbe44021.htm#fr_194.md) Literally, who
knows that (element) in the Full and New-moon sacrifices whereby . . .

<span id="fn_195"></span>[52:2](sbe44021.htm#fr_195.md) The word
'durbîri*n*âni' is of doubtful meaning, the etymology proposed by
Sâya*n*a having little claim to being seriously considered. In the St.
Petersb. Dict. the meaning 'bristly' is assigned to it, as applied to
the hair of the beard.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[53:1](sbe44021.htm#fr_196.md) Sâya*n*a takes
'upaguhya' in the sense of 'having embraced (him),' that being the
meaning the verb has in classical Sanskrit;--ta*m* Svaidâyanam upaguhya
âliṅgya Uddâlakas tasmât sthânân ni*sk*akrâma nishkrântavân. The
Gopatha-Br. has 'tad upayamya' (having taken it) instead. Svaidâyana
evidently did not wish the other Brahmans to know that he had had the
better of the Kurupa*ñk*âla.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[53:2](sbe44021.htm#fr_197.md) ? Or, to catechize
him; Brahma svaya*m* vedâdya*h* brahmaputro brahmish*th*asya Gotamasya
putra ity etad yathâv*ri*ttam eva, api to ya*h* purusha enam Uddâlakam
upavalheta pradhâna*m* *s*resh*th*ya*m* (? *s*resh*th*a*m*)
kuryât--varha valha prâdhânya iti dhâtu*h*--asya purushasya mûrdhâ
vipatet, alpa*gñ*ânasya âdhikyena viparyayagraha*n*ât
tannimitta-*s*ira*h*patanam bhavatîty artha*h*, Sây.--Prof. Geldner
translates,--'He must rack his brains (muss sich den Kopf zerbrechen)
who wants to outdo him in questions (überfragen).'

<span id="fn_198"></span>[54:1](sbe44021.htm#fr_198.md) That is, as a pupil
(brahma*k*ârin) would to his teacher.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[54:2](sbe44021.htm#fr_199.md) Viz. the
'sha*d*avatta,' or share consisting of six 'cuttings,' for which see I,
8, 1, 41 with note.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[54:3](sbe44021.htm#fr_200.md) With these
oblations there is no puro<sup>ऽ</sup>nuvâkyâ, but only a yâ*g*yâ, or
offering-formula.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[55:1](sbe44021.htm#fr_201.md) Whilst the gâyatrî
verse consists of 3 × 8 syllables, the trish*t*ubh has 4 × 11 syllables.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[55:2](sbe44021.htm#fr_202.md) That is, pouring
the second into the fire at a place immediately to the front, or
eastward, of the first.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[55:3](sbe44021.htm#fr_203.md) That is, the
invitatory and offering-formulas used for the oblation to Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t; see part i, p. 307, note 1.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[55:4](sbe44021.htm#fr_204.md) For this bunch
taken from the sacrificial grass before it is spread on the
altar-ground, and symbolically representing the Sacrificer, see I, 3, 3,
4 seqq.; and part i, p. 84, note 2.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[56:1](sbe44021.htm#fr_205.md) That is, at the
New-moon sacrifice, with the Sânnâyya, or mixture of sour curds with
sweet boiled milk. The 'iti' after 'puro*d*â*s*ena' is taken by Sâya*n*a
in the sense of '*k*a'; and though this cannot be accepted, it is not
very easy to see what force it can have here.
