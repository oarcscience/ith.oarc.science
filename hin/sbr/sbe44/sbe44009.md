### SEVENTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:7:1">11:1:7:1</span></span>1. Now
there, on the occasion of the entering on the fast, it is said <span
id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114), 'If he does not eat, he becomes

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

consecrated to the Fathers <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115); and if
he does eat he eats whilst passing over the gods;' and, in this respect,
they lay down the rule, 'Let him therefore eat what grows in the
forest.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:7:2">11:1:7:2</span></span>2. If
he eats cultivated plants he eats the sacrificial essence of the
offering-cake; and if he eats forest plants he eats the essence of the
barhis <span id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_116); and if he eats aught of
trees he eats the essence of the fuel (for the sacrificial fire); and if
he drinks milk he consumes the essence of the Sânnâyya <span
id="fr_117"></span>[3](#fn_117); and if he drinks water he consumes the
essence of the lustral waters <span id="fr_118"></span>[4](#fn_118); and
if he eats nothing he becomes consecrated to the Fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:7:3">11:1:7:3</span></span>3. As
to this they say, 'What course of procedure is there?' Well, let him, on
those two nights (of full and new moon), himself offer the Agnihotra:
inasmuch as, after offering, he takes food he does not become
consecrated to the Fathers, for that (libation) is an offering; and
inasmuch as he performs that offering in his own self he does not eat of
those sacrificial essences.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:7:4">11:1:7:4</span></span>4. Now
all the nights concentrate themselves in these two nights: all the
nights of the waxing moon concentrate in the night of full moon, and all
the nights of the waning moon concentrate in the night of new moon; and,
verily, for him who, knowing this, offers (the Agnihotra) himself on the
day of

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

the entrance on the fast, offering is always made by himself <span
id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_114"></span>[20:2](sbe44009.htm#fr_114) See I, 1, 1, 9. 10.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[21:1](sbe44009.htm#fr_115) That is, he would
be liable to die, and join the departed ancestors.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[21:2](sbe44009.htm#fr_116) The layer of
sacrificial grass spread on the Vedi, serving as a seat for the deities
to whom offering is made.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[21:3](sbe44009.htm#fr_117) For this dish,
prepared of sweet and sour milk, and offered at the New-moon sacrifice,
see part i, p. 178, note 4.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[21:4](sbe44009.htm#fr_118) For the
Pra*n*îtâ*h*, see I, 1, 1, 12.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[22:1](sbe44009.htm#fr_119) That is to say,
even though on other nights the Agnihotra were performed for him by a
priest, it would always count as being performed by himself.
