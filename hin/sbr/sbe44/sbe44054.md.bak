### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:2:1">12:3:2:1</span></span>1. The
Year is Man <span id="fr_489"></span>[1](#fn_489.md):--'Man' is one unit,
and 'year' is another, and these now are one and the same;--there are in
the year the two, day and night, and in man there are these two
breathings, and these now are one and the same;--there are three seasons
in the year, and these three breathings in man, and these (two) now are
one and the same;--'sa*m*vatsara (year)' consists of four syllables, and
so does 'ya*g*amâna (sacrificer),' and these (two) now are one and the
same;--there are five seasons in the year, and these five breathings in
man, and these (two) now are one and the same;--there are six seasons in
the year, and these six breathings in man, and these (two) now are one
and the same;--there are seven seasons in the year, and these seven
breathings in man, and these (two) now are one and the same.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:2:2">12:3:2:2</span></span>2.
There are twelve months in the year, and these twelve breathings in man,
and these (two) now are one and the same;--there are thirteen months in
the (leap-) year, and these thirteen (channels of) breathings in man,
the navel being the thirteenth, and these (two) now are one and the
same;--there are twenty-four half-months in the year, and this man is
twenty-four-fold, being possessed of twenty fingers and toes and four
limbs; and. these (two) now are one and the same;--there are twenty-six
half-months in the (leap-) year, and this man is twenty-six-fold, the
two feet making up the twenty-six; and these (two) now are one and the
same.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:2:3">12:3:2:3</span></span>3. And
there are three hundred and sixty nights

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

in the year, and three hundred and sixty bones in man, and these (two)
now are one and the same;--there are three hundred and sixty days in the
year, and three hundred and sixty parts of marrow in man, and these
(two) now are one and the same.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:2:4">12:3:2:4</span></span>4. And
there are seven hundred and twenty days and nights in the year, and
seven hundred and twenty bones and parts of marrow in man, and these
(two) now are one and the same.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:2:5">12:3:2:5</span></span>5. And
there are ten thousand and eight hundred 'muhûrta' in the year; and
fifteen times as many 'kshipras' as there are 'muhûrta'; and fifteen
times as many 'etarhi' as there are 'kshipra;' and fifteen times as many
'idâni' as there are 'etarhi'; and fifteen times as many breathings as
there are 'idâni'; and as many spirations as there are breathings <span
id="fr_490"></span>[1](#fn_490.md); and as many twinklings of the eye as
there are spirations, and as many hair-pits as there are twinklings of
the eye, and as many sweat-pores as there are hair-pits; and as many
sweat-pores as there are so many drops it rains.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:2:6">12:3:2:6</span></span>6.
Concerning this, Vârkali, knowing this, once said, 'I know the raining
cloud extending over the whole earth, and the drops of that rain.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:2:7">12:3:2:7</span></span>7. It
is with reference thereto that this verse is told,--Whilst whirling
round, be it standing, or sitting, or even sleeping, how often does man,
otherwise than from toil, breathe and expel the air regularly <span
id="fr_491"></span>[2](#fn_491.md) by day and night?

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:2:8">12:3:2:8</span></span>8. And
in answer thereto this verse is told,--

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Inasmuch as man is
what is measured a hundred hundred and eight hundred, therefore they
say:--so often does man regularly <span id="fr_492"></span>[1](#fn_492.md)
breathe and expel the air by day and night.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[168:1](sbe44054.htm#fr_489.md) Or, the man,
identified with the Sacrificer.

<span id="fn_490"></span>[169:1](sbe44054.htm#fr_490.md) Perhaps the
distinction. between 'prâ*n*a' and 'ana' here is that of out-breathing
and in-breathing.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[169:2](sbe44054.htm#fr_491.md) Or, uniformly
(gleichmässig). The St. Petersb. Dict. here takes 'samena' in the sense
of 'exactly.'

<span id="fn_492"></span>[170:1](sbe44054.htm#fr_492.md) See note
[2](sbe44104.htm#fn_954) on [p. 369](sbe44104.htm#page_369.md).
