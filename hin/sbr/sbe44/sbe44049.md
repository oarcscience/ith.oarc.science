### SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:1:1">12:2:1:1</span></span>1.
Verily, those who become initiated for (a sacrificial session of) a year
cross an ocean: the Prâya*n*îya Atirâtra is a flight of steps <span
id="fr_440"></span>[2](#fn_440), for it is by means of a flight of steps
that one enters (the water); and

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

when they enter on the Prâya*n*îya Atirâtra it is just as if they were
entering the ocean by a flight of steps.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:1:2">12:2:1:2</span></span>2. The
*K*aturvi*ms*a day is (in the form of) a foothold, a shallow place <span
id="fr_441"></span>[1](#fn_441), such a one as (where the water reaches)
either to the arm-pits or to the neck, whence, having rested, they
enter <span id="fr_442"></span>[2](#fn_442) (the deep water). The
Abhiplava is (a spot) suitable for swimming; and so is the P*ri*sh*th*ya
suitable for swimming.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:1:3">12:2:1:3</span></span>3. The
Abhi*g*it is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as (where the water
reaches) either to the arm-pits, or to the neck, whence, having rested,
they come out (of the water). The first Svarasâman is thigh-deep, the
second knee-deep, the third knuckle-deep. The Vishuvat is a foothold (in
the form of) an island. The first (Svarasâman) with reversed Sâmans is
knuckle-deep, the second knee-deep, and the third thigh-deep.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:1:4">12:2:1:4</span></span>4. The
Vi*s*va*g*it is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as (where the
water reaches) either to the arm-pits or to the neck, whence, having
rested, he enters (the deep water again). The P*ri*sh*th*ya is suitable
for swimming, and so is the Abhiplava, and so are the Go and Âyus, and
so is the Da*s*arâtra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:1:5">12:2:1:5</span></span>5. The
Mahâvrata is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as (where the water
reaches) either to the arm-pits or to the neck, whence, having rested,

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

they step out (of the water). The Udayanîya (concluding) Atirâtra is a
flight of steps, for it is by a flight of steps that people step out (of
the water): thus, when they perform the Udayanîya Atirâtra, it is just
as if, having entered the sea by a flight of steps, they were to step
out of it, by a flight of steps.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:1:6">12:2:1:6</span></span>6.
Regarding this they say, 'How many Atirâtras are there in the year, how
many Agnish*t*omas, how many Ukthyas, how many Sho*d*a*s*ins, how many
Sha*d*ahas?'--Two Atirâtras, a hundred and six Agnish*t*omas, and two
hundred and forty Ukthyas,--thus in the case of those who perform the
Svarasâmans as Ukthyas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:1:7">12:2:1:7</span></span>7. But
in the case of those who perform them as Agnish*t*omas, a hundred and
twelve Agnish*t*omas, two hundred and thirty-four Ukthyas, twelve
Sho*d*a*s*ins, and sixty Sha*d*ahas. This, then, is how the year is
obtained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:1:8">12:2:1:8</span></span>8.
There are twelve months in the year, and their vital energy and power
are the P*ri*sh*th*as; and by performing the P*ri*sh*th*as month by
month, they obtain, in monthly portions <span
id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_443), that vital energy of the year.--'And
how do they obtain the vital energy of the thirteenth (intercalary)
month?' Well, subsequent to the Vishuvat day they perform the
Vi*s*va*g*it Agnish*t*oma with all the P*ri*sh*th*as <span
id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_444), and thus indeed they obtain the vital
energy of the thirteenth month.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:1:9">12:2:1:9</span></span>9. Now,
concerning this, *S*vetaketu Âru*n*eya,

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

knowing this, once said, 'I am now going to get myself initiated for one
year.' His father, looking at him, said, 'Knowest thou, long-lived one,
the fording-footholds of the year?'--'I know them,' he replied, for,
indeed, he said this as one knowing it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_440"></span>[145:2](sbe44049.htm#fr_440) Or, a descent, a
passage leading down to a bathing-place.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[146:1](sbe44049.htm#fr_441) Gâdham eva
pratish*th*â,--it may be remarked that this is just the form in which an
appositional compound is analyzed by native grammarians, as if it were
'gâdha-pratish*th*â,' a foothold which is just a ford, a ford-foothold,
as indeed it is written in paragraph 9. Cf. p. 66, note 4.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[146:2](sbe44049.htm#fr_442) Or,
bathe,--'prasnâti,' indeed, would really seem to mean here 'he swims
forward.'

<span id="fn_443"></span>[147:1](sbe44049.htm#fr_443) Lit., by the
month, i.e. by monthly instalments; cf. Tâ*nd*ya Br. IV, 2, 9.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[147:2](sbe44049.htm#fr_444) On Soma-days with
all the (six) P*ri*sh*th*a-sâmans, see part iii, introd., p. xxi.
