### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENTS OF THE CHANTS OF THE A*S*VAMEDHA.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:1">13:5:4:1</span></span>1. Now,
Indrota Daivâpa *S*aunaka once performed this sacrifice for
*G*aname*g*aya Pârikshita, and by performing it he extinguished all
evil-doing, all Brahman-slaughter; and, verily, he who performs the
A*s*vamedha extinguishes (the guilt incurred by) all evil-doing, all
Brahman-slaughter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:2">13:5:4:2</span></span>2. It
is of this, indeed, that the Gâthâ (strophe) sings,--'In Âsandîvat <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[1](#fn_1029), *G*aname*g*aya bound for the gods a
black-spotted, grain-eating horse, adorned with a golden ornament and
with yellow garlands.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:3">13:5:4:3</span></span>3.
\[There are\] those same first two days <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[2](#fn_1030), and a *G*yotis <span
id="fr_1036"></span>[3](#fn_1031) Atirâtra: therewith (they sacrificed)
for Bhîmasena;--those same first two days, and a Go Atirâtra: therewith
(they sacrificed) for Ugrasena;--those same first two days, and an Âyus
Atirâtra: therewith (they sacrificed) for *S*rutasena. These are the
Pârikshitîyas <span id="fr_1037"></span>[4](#fn_1032), and it is of this
that the Gâthâ sings,--'The righteous Pârikshitas, performing
horse-sacrifices, by their righteous work did away with sinful work one
after another.'

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:4">13:5:4:4</span></span>4.
Those same first two days, and an Abhi*g*it <span
id="fr_1038"></span>[1](#fn_1033) Atirâtra,--therewith Para Â*t*nâra,
the Kausalya king, once sacrificed: it is of this that Gâthâ
sings,--'A*t*nâra's son, the Kausalya Para, Haira*n*yanâbha, caused a
horse, meet for sacrifice, to be bound, and gave away the replete
regions.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:5">13:5:4:5</span></span>5.
Those same first two days, and a Vi*s*va*g*it <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[1](#fn_1033) Atirâtra,--therewith Purukutsa, the
Aikshvâka king, once on a time performed a horse (daurgaha)-sacrifice,
whence it is of this that the *Ri*shi sings (*Ri*g-v. IV, 42,
8),--'These, the seven *Ri*shis, were then our fathers when
Daurgaha <span id="fr_1040"></span>[2](#fn_1034) was bound.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:6">13:5:4:6</span></span>6.
Those same first two days, and a Mahâvrata <span
id="fr_1041"></span>[3](#fn_1035) Atirâtra,--therewith Marutta
Âvikshita, the Âyogava king, once performed sacrifice; whence the Maruts
became his guards-men, Agni his chamberlain, and the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* his
counsellors: it is of this that the Gâthâ sings,--'The Maruts dwelt as
guards-men in Marutta Âvikshita's house, Agni as his chamberlain, and
the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* as his counsellors.' And, verily, the Maruts become
the guards-men, Agni the chamberlain, and the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* the
counsellors of him who performs the horse-sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:7">13:5:4:7</span></span>7.
Those same first two days, and an Aptoryâma <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[4](#fn_1036) Atirâtra,--it was therewith that
Kraivya, the Pâ*ñk*âla king, once performed sacrifice,--for Krivis they
formerly called the Pa*ñk*âlas: it is of this that the Gâthâ sings,--'At
Parivakrâ, the

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pâ*ñk*âla overlord
of the Krivis seized a horse, meet for sacrifice, with offering-gifts of
a hundred thousand (head of cattle).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:8">13:5:4:8</span></span>8. And
a second (Gâthâ),--'A thousand myriads there were, and five-and-twenty
hundreds, which the Brâhma*n*as of the Pa*ñk*âlas from every quarter
divided between them.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:9">13:5:4:9</span></span>9. The
Agnish*t*oma in the Triv*ri*t (stoma); the Ukthya in the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a;
and the third day, with the Uktha (stotras), in the Saptada*s*a; the
Sho*d*a*s*in (stotra) in the Ekavi*ms*a, the night (stotras) in the
Pa*ñk*ada*s*a, and the Sandhi (stotra) in the Triv*ri*t,--this is the
(sacrifice) resulting in the Anush*t*ubh <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[1](#fn_1037): it is therewith that sacrifice was
performed by Dhvasan Dvaitavana, the king of the Matsyas, where there is
the lake Dvaitavana; and it is of this that the Gâthâ sings,--'Fourteen
steeds did king Dvaitavana, victorious in battle, bind for Indra
V*ri*trahan, whence the lake Dvaitavana (took its name).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:10">13:5:4:10</span></span>10.
The (three) Pavamâna (stotras) in the *K*aturvi*ms*a (stoma), and (those
performed) by repetitions <span id="fr_1044"></span>[2](#fn_1038) in the
Triv*ri*t; the Pavamânas in the Katu*sk*atvâri*ms*a (44-versed stoma),
and (those performed) by repetition <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[3](#fn_1039) in the Ekavi*ms*a; the Pavamânas in

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

the Ash*t*â*k*atvâri*ms*a (48), and (those performed) by repetition in
the Trayastri*ms*a (33) up to the Agnish*t*oma-sâman, the Uktha
(stotras) in the Dvâtri*ms*a (32), the Sho*d*a*s*in in the Ekavi*ms*a,
the night (stotras) in the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a, and the Sandhi (stotra) in the
Triv*ri*t

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:11">13:5:4:11</span></span>11.
Suchlike is Vish*n*u's striding <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[1](#fn_1040),--it was therewith that Bharata
Dau*h*shanti once performed sacrifice, and attained that wide sway which
now belongs to the Bharatas: it is of this that the Gâthâ
sings,--'Seventy-eight steeds did Bharata Dau*h*shanti bind for the
V*ri*tra-slayer on the Yamunâ, and fifty-five near the Gaṅgâ.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:12">13:5:4:12</span></span>12.
And a second (Gâthâ),--'Having bound a hundred and thirty-three horses,
meet for sacrifice, king Saudyumni, more shifty, overcame the other
shiftless ones.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:13">13:5:4:13</span></span>13.
And a third,--'At Nâ*d*apit <span id="fr_1047"></span>[2](#fn_1041), the
Apsaras *S*akuntalâ conceived Bharata, who, after conquering the whole
earth, brought to Indra more than a thousand horses, meet for
sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:14">13:5:4:14</span></span>14.
And a fourth <span id="fr_1048"></span>[3](#fn_1042),--'The greatness of
Bharata neither the men before nor those after him attained, nor did the
five (tribes of) men, even as a mortal man (does not touch) the sky with
his arms.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:15">13:5:4:15</span></span>15.
With the Ekavi*ms*a-stoma <span id="fr_1049"></span>[4](#fn_1043)
Rishabha Yâ*gñ*atura,

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

king of the *S*viknas, performed sacrifice: it is of this that the Gâthâ
sings,--'When Rishabha Yâ*gñ*atura was sacrificing, the Brahman-folk,
having received wealth at the A*s*vamedha, divided the offering-gifts
between them.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:16">13:5:4:16</span></span>16.
With the Trayastri*ms*a-stoma *S*o*n*a Sâtrâsâha, the Pâ*ñk*âla king,
performed sacrifice: it is of this that the Gâthâ sings,--'When
Sâtrâsâha performs the horse-sacrifice, the Trayastri*ms*a (stomas) come
forth as (Taurva*s*a) horses, and six thousand mail-clad men <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[1](#fn_1044).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:17">13:5:4:17</span></span>17.
And a second (Gâthâ),--'At the sacrifice of thee, Koka's father, the
Trayastri*ms*a (stomas) come forth, each as six times six thousand <span
id="fr_1051"></span>[2](#fn_1045) (horses), and six thousand mail-clad
men.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:18">13:5:4:18</span></span>18.
And a third,--'When Sâtrâsâha, the Pâ*ñk*âla king, was sacrificing,
wearing beautiful garlands, Indra revelled in Soma, and the Brâhma*n*as
became satiated with wealth.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:19">13:5:4:19</span></span>19.
*S*atânîka Sâtrâ*g*ita performed the Govinata (form of A*s*vamedha),
after taking away the

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

horse of the Kâ*s*ya (king); and since that time the Kâ*s*is do not keep
up the (sacrificial) fires, saying, 'The Soma-drink has been taken from
us.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:20">13:5:4:20</span></span>20.
The mode (of chanting) for this (Govinata form) is:--the Pavamâna
(stotras) in the *K*aturvi*ms*a (stoma), and (those chanted) by
repetitions in the Triv*ri*t;--the Pavamânas in the
*K*atu*sk*atvâri*ms*a, the Â*g*ya (stotras) in the Ekavi*ms*a, the
Ukthas <span id="fr_1052"></span>[1](#fn_1046) In the Tri*n*ava, the
P*ri*sh*th*as in the Ekavi*ms*a;--the Pavamânas in the Sha*t*tri*ms*a
(36-versed), and (those chanted) by repetitions in the Trayastri*ms*a
(33) up to the Agnish*t*oma-sâman, the Ukthas in the Ekavi*ms*a, the
Sho*d*a*s*in in the Ekavi*ms*a, the night (stotras) in the
Pa*ñk*ada*s*a, and the Sandhi (stotra) in the Triv*ri*t.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:21">13:5:4:21</span></span>21.
It is of this that the Gâthâ sings,--'*S*atânîka Sâtrâ*g*ita seized a
sacrificial horse, in the neighbourhood, the sacrifice of the Kâ*s*is,
even as Bharata (seized that) of the Satvats.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:22">13:5:4:22</span></span>22.
And a second,--'The mighty *S*atânîka, having seized, in the
neighbourhood, Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra's white sacrificial horse, roaming at
will in its tenth month, *S*atânîka <span
id="fr_1053"></span>[2](#fn_1047) performed the Govinata-sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:23">13:5:4:23</span></span>23.
And a fourth <span id="fr_1054"></span>[3](#fn_1048),--'The greatness of
the Bharatas neither the men before nor those after them attained, nor
did the seven (tribes of) men, even as a mortal man (does not touch) the
sky with his flanks.'

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:24">13:5:4:24</span></span>24.
Now as to the sacrificial gifts. Whatever there is towards the middle of
the kingdom other than the land, the men, and the property of the
Brâhma*n*a, of that the eastern region belongs to the Hot*ri*, the
southern to the Brahman, the western to the Adhvaryu, the northern to
the Udgât*ri*; and the Hot*ri*kas share this along with them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:25">13:5:4:25</span></span>25.
When the Udayanîyâ (completing offering) is finished, he seizes
twenty-one barren cows, sacred to Mitra-Varu*n*a, the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*,
and B*ri*haspati, with the view of his gaining those deities. And the
reason why those sacred to B*ri*haspati come last is that B*ri*haspati
is the Brahman (n.), and he thus establishes himself finally in the
Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:26">13:5:4:26</span></span>26.
And as to their being twenty-one of them,--the twenty-one-fold is he who
shines yonder: twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and
yonder sun as the twenty-first--this consummation (he thereby obtains).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:27">13:5:4:27</span></span>27.
When the Udavasânîyâ (closing offering) is completed, they give, for a
sacrificial gift, four women, with a maiden as the fifth, and four
hundred female attendants according to agreement.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:4:28">13:5:4:28</span></span>28.
And during the following year he performs the animal sacrifices of the
seasons,--six (victims) sacred to Agni in the spring, six to Indra in
the summer, six to Par*g*anya, or to the Maruts, in the rainy season,
six to Mitra and Varu*n*a in the autumn, six to Indra and Vish*n*u in
the winter, and six to Indra and B*ri*haspati in the dewy season,--six
seasons are a year: in the seasons, in the year, he thus establishes
himself. These amount to thirty-six animals,--the B*ri*hatî (metre)
consists of thirty-six syllables, and the heavenly world is established

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

upon the B*ri*hatî: and thus he finally establishes himself, by means of
the B*ri*hatî metre, in the heavenly world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1029"></span>[396:1](sbe44109.htm#fr_1034) Lit., (in the
city, nagare, Harisvâmin) possessed of a throne. Cf. Ait. Br. VIII, 2 1.

<span id="fn_1030"></span>[396:2](sbe44109.htm#fr_1035) Viz., as stated
before, an Agnish*t*oma and an Ukthya.

<span id="fn_1031"></span>[396:3](sbe44109.htm#fr_1036) As to the
difference between the *G*yotis, Go, and Âyus forms of the Agnish*t*oma
sacrifice, see part iv, p. 287, note 2.

<span id="fn_1032"></span>[396:4](sbe44109.htm#fr_1037) That is,
according to Harisvâmin (and the Gâthâ), the brothers of
(*G*aname*g*aya) Pârikshita, though one would rather have thought of his
sons, the grandsons of Parikshit.

<span id="fn_1033"></span>[397:1](sbe44109.htm#fr_1039) Regarding the
Abhi*g*it and Vi*s*va*g*it, see part iv, p. 320, note 2.

<span id="fn_1034"></span>[397:2](sbe44109.htm#fr_1040) Sâya*n*a,
differently from our Brâhma*n*a, takes Daurgaha as the patronymic of
Purukutsa (son of Durgaha).

<span id="fn_1035"></span>[397:3](sbe44109.htm#fr_1041) See part iv, p.
282, note 5.

<span id="fn_1036"></span>[397:4](sbe44109.htm#fr_1042) See part iii,
introd. p. xx.

<span id="fn_1037"></span>[398:1](sbe44109.htm#fr_1043) Viz. inasmuch
as, according to Harisvâmin, all the Stotras amount together to 798
verses, which make twenty-five anush*t*ubh verses (of 32 syllables each)
or thereabouts.

<span id="fn_1038"></span>[398:2](sbe44109.htm#fr_1044) That is to say,
all the remaining nine stotras of this, the Agnish*t*oma, day, the
so-called Dhuryas, viz. the Â*g*ya-stotras, the P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras,
and the Agnish*t*oma-sâman, in all of which the respective Stoma is
obtained by repetitions of the three stotriyâ-verses.

<span id="fn_1039"></span>[398:3](sbe44109.htm#fr_1045) In this, the
Ukthya, day, this includes also the three Uktha-stotras, as being, as it
were, the Dhuryas of the Hot*ri*'s assistants <span id="page_399">p.
399</span> (cf. part iii, introd. p. xiv seqq.); whilst in the
directions regarding the next day they are not included, as requiring a
different Stoma.

<span id="fn_1040"></span>[399:1](sbe44109.htm#fr_1046) Just as there
are here wide intervals between the Stomas, so Vish*n*u, in his three
strides, passes over wide distances, comm.

<span id="fn_1041"></span>[399:2](sbe44109.htm#fr_1047) This, according
to Harisvâmin, is the name of Ka*n*va's hermitage. Cf. Leumann, Zeitsch.
d. D. M. G., XLVIII, p. 81.

<span id="fn_1042"></span>[399:3](sbe44109.htm#fr_1048) Cf. Ait. Br.
VIII, 23; Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 202.

<span id="fn_1043"></span>[399:4](sbe44109.htm#fr_1049) That is, using
the 21-versed form throughout the three days.

<span id="fn_1044"></span>[400:1](sbe44109.htm#fr_1050) This seems to be
Harisvâmin's interpretation of the verse:--torva*s*â a*s*vâ *g*yesh*th*e
tam api s*ri*gyeran iti (?) trayastri*ms*â stomâ udga*kkh*anti, sa hi
*S*o*n*as trayastri*ms*ân eva stomân trishv api divaseshu prayuṅkte
nânyân iti to udga*kkh*antîty âha, sha*t* tu sahasrâ*n*i varmi*n*â*m*
râ*g*aputrâ*n*â*m* kava*k*inâm a*s*vapâlânâm udîrata iti vartate varshe
prâptâ eva drash*t*avyâ*h*. The St. Petersb. Dict., on the other hand,
construes 'trayastri*ms*â*h*' along with 'sha*t* sahasrâ*n*i' = 6033 (?
horses of mail-clad men). This interpretation seems to me to involve
serious difficulties. The use of those Stomas doubtless is supposed to
result in the advantages here enumerated.

<span id="fn_1045"></span>[400:2](sbe44109.htm#fr_1051) Koko nâma
nâtha*h*, ke te a*s*vâ udîrata iti prathamâyâ*m* gâthâyâm ukta*m* tad
atrâpy anuvartate; teshâ*m* tatra parimâ*n*a*m* noktam atra
sha*t*tri*m*sad a*s*vasahasrâ*n*i rakshi*n*âm anu*k*arabhntâny
udga*kkh*antîty âha; trayastri*ms*â*s* *k*odîrate sha*d* *dh*i(?)
varmi*n*â*m* padânetâsu (?) ga*kkh*antîti. Harisvâmin.

<span id="fn_1046"></span>[401:1](sbe44109.htm#fr_1052) Why these are
here put before the P*ri*sh*th*as, is not clear.

<span id="fn_1047"></span>[401:2](sbe44109.htm#fr_1053) Perhaps we ought
here to read 'Sâtrâ*g*ita.'

<span id="fn_1048"></span>[401:3](sbe44109.htm#fr_1054) Unless the Gâthâ
in the preceding paragraph (being in the Trish*t*ubh metre) is really
counted as two, the author seems here purposely to have omitted a verse.
Possibly, however, it may mean, 'the fourth,' viz. referring to
[paragraph 14](sbe44109.htm#13:5:4:14).
