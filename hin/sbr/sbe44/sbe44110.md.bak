### SIXTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE PURUSHAMEDHA, OR HUMAN SACRIFICE.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:1:1">13:6:1:1</span></span>1.
Purusha Nârâya*n*a desired, 'Would that I overpassed all beings! would
that I alone were everything here (this universe)!' He beheld this
five-days’ sacrificial performance, the Purushamedha, and took it <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1](#fn_1049.md), and performed offering therewith; and
having performed offering therewith, he overpassed all beings, and
became everything here. And, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the
Purushamedha, or who even knows this, overpasses all beings, and becomes
everything here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:1:2">13:6:1:2</span></span>2. For
this (offering) there are twenty-three Dîkshâs, twelve Upasads, and five
Sutyâs (Soma-days). This, then, being a forty-days’ (performance),
including the Dîkshâs and Upasads, amounts to a Virâ*g* <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[2](#fn_1050.md), for the Virâ*g* consists of forty
syllables: \[Vâ*g*. S. XXXI, 5.\] 'Thence <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[3](#fn_1051) Virâ*g* (f..md) was born, and from out of
Virâ*g* the Pûrusha.'

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This, then, is
that Virâ*g*, and from out of that Virâ*g* he (the Sacrificer) generates
the Purusha, the Sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:1:3">13:6:1:3</span></span>3. Now
these (forty days) are four decades; and as to there being these four
decades, it is for the obtainment of these worlds, as well as of the
regions: by the first decade they <span
id="fr_1058"></span>[1](#fn_1052) obtained even this (terrestrial.md)
world, by the second the air, by the third the sky, and by the fourth
the regions (quarters); and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by the
first decade, obtain even this (terrestrial) world, by the second the
air, by the third the sky, and by the fourth the regions--and, indeed,
as much as these worlds and the regions are, so much is all this
(universe); and the Purushamedha is everything: thus it is for the sake
of his obtaining and securing everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:1:4">13:6:1:4</span></span>4. On
the Upavasatha <span id="fr_1059"></span>[2](#fn_1053) (day.md) there are
eleven victims sacred to Agni and Soma: the performance for these is one
and the same. There are eleven stakes,--the Trish*t*ubh (verse) consists
of eleven syllables, and the Trish*t*ubh is a thunderbolt, and the
Trish*t*ubh is vigour: with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer
thus from the first repels evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:1:5">13:6:1:5</span></span>5. On
the Sutyâ (days) there are the (Savanîya) victims of the set of
eleven <span id="fr_1060"></span>[3](#fn_1054) (stakes.md),--the
Trish*t*ubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trish*t*ubh is a
thunderbolt, and the Trish*t*ubh is vigour: with the thunderbolt, with
vigour, the Sacrificer thus from the first repels evil.

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:1:6">13:6:1:6</span></span>6. And,
again, as to why there are (the victims) of the set of eleven (stakes):
it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing everything, for the set
of eleven (stakes) is everything, since the set of eleven (stakes) is
Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati is everything, and the Purushamedha is
everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:1:7">13:6:1:7</span></span>7. Now
this Purushamedha is a five-days’ sacrificial performance--the sacrifice
is fivefold, the victim is fivefold, and five seasons are a year:
whatsoever of five kinds there is, either concerning the deity or the
self (body), all that he thereby obtains.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:1:8">13:6:1:8</span></span>8. The
first day thereof is an Agnish*t*oma; then (follows) an Ukthya, then an
Atirâtra, then an Ukthya, then an Agnish*t*oma: this (sacrifice) thus
has light (*g*yotis <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1](#fn_1055).md) on both
sides, and an Ukthya on both sides (of the central Atirâtra).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:1:9">13:6:1:9</span></span>9. It
is a five-days’ (sacrifice), like a barley-corn in the middle <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[2](#fn_1056.md); for the Purushamedha is these worlds,
and these worlds have light on both sides--through Agni (the sacrificial
fire) on this side, and through Âditya (the Sun) on the other: therefore
it has light on both sides. And the Ukthya is food, and the Atirâtra the
body (self); and because there are these Ukthyas on both sides of the
Atirâtra, therefore this body is surrounded by food. And that Atirâtra
which is the largest of them is in. the middle, it is thereby that it
(the body, or sacrifice) is like a barley-corn (yava) in the middle;
and, verily,

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

whosoever knows this repels (yu) his hateful enemy: 'He alone exists,
not his hateful enemy,' thus they say of him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:1:10">13:6:1:10</span></span>10.
The first day is for it this same (terrestrial) world, and the spring
season <span id="fr_1063"></span>[1](#fn_1057.md) also is this its
(terrestrial) world; and the second day is what there is above this
(terrestrial) world and below the air, and the summer season also is
that (part) of it; and the central day is its air, and the rainy and
autumn seasons also are its air; and the fourth day is what is above the
air, and below the sky, and the winter season also is that (part) of it;
and its fifth day is the sky, and the dewy season also is its sky: thus
as to the deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:1:11">13:6:1:11</span></span>11.
Then as to the body <span id="fr_1064"></span>[2](#fn_1058.md). The first
day is its feet, and the spring season also is its feet; and the second
day is what is above the feet, and below the waist, and the summer
season also is that (part) of it; and the central day is its waist, and
the rainy and autumn seasons also are its waist; the fourth day is what
is above the waist and below the head, and the winter season also is
that (part) of it; and the fifth day is its head, and the dewy season
also is its head:--thus these worlds, as well as the year and the
(sacrificer's) self, pass into the Purushamedha for the obtainment and
securing of everything, for, indeed, these worlds are everything, and
the year is everything, and the self is everything, and the Purushamedha
is everything.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1049"></span>[403:1](sbe44110.htm#fr_1055.md) That is,
according to Harisvâmin, he brought its powers into play, and
accomplished all his desires:--tatsâdhanâny upâpâdayat, tenâya*m*
ya*g*anena samîhita*m* sakala*m* sâdhitavân ity artha*h*.

<span id="fn_1050"></span>[403:2](sbe44110.htm#fr_1056.md) The
Virâ*g*-verse consists of decasyllabic pâdas, the most common form of
the verse being one of three pâdas (or thirty syllables), whilst here
the one consisting of four pâdas is alluded to, and Virâ*g*-verses of
one and two pâdas likewise occur. There is also a parallel form of the
Virâ*g*-metre consisting of (usually three) hendeca-syllabic pâdas.

<span id="fn_1051"></span>[403:3](sbe44110.htm#fr_1057.md) That is, from
the Purusha; cf. Rig-v. S. X, 90, 5.

<span id="fn_1052"></span>[404:1](sbe44110.htm#fr_1058.md) Harisvâmin
supplies 'pûrve purushâ*h*' (? former men, or the first seven
purushâ*h*, the seven *Ri*shis).

<span id="fn_1053"></span>[404:2](sbe44110.htm#fr_1059.md) That is, the day
before the Soma-sacrifice.

<span id="fn_1054"></span>[404:3](sbe44110.htm#fr_1060.md) See III, 7, 2, 1
seqq.

<span id="fn_1055"></span>[405:1](sbe44110.htm#fr_1061.md) Viz. an
Agnish*t*oma form of the Gyotish*t*oma order of sacrifice. Cf. part iv,
p. 287, note 2.

<span id="fn_1056"></span>[405:2](sbe44110.htm#fr_1062.md) That is,
becoming larger towards the middle, inasmuch as the Ukthya is--as far as
Stotras and Sastras, and cups of Soma are concerned--a larger sacrifice
than the Agnish*t*oma; and the Atirâtra is the largest form of all.

<span id="fn_1057"></span>[406:1](sbe44110.htm#fr_1063.md) It should be
borne in mind here that the sacrifice (Pra*g*âpati) is identical with
the Sacrificer on the one hand, and with the year on the other.

<span id="fn_1058"></span>[406:2](sbe44110.htm#fr_1064.md) Or, as to the
self, viz. of Pra*g*âpati (and the Sacrificer), which the sacrifice is
supposed to reproduce.
