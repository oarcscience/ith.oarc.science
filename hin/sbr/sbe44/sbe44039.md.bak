### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:3:1">11:7:3:1</span></span>1. Such
a (sacrificial stake) as has much substance <span
id="fr_384"></span>[1](#fn_384.md) is not auspicious to cattle, whence he
who desires to have cattle should not make such a one his sacrificial
stake: but such a one as is of little hardness is auspicious to cattle,
whence he who desires to have cattle should make such a one his
sacrificial stake.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:3:2">11:7:3:2</span></span>2. And
such a one as, while being crooked, has a top like a spit, is called
'kapotî <span id="fr_385"></span>[2](#fn_385.md)'; and whoever makes such a
one his sacrificial stake certainly goes to yonder world before his full
measure of life: therefore let no one wishing for long life make such a
one his sacrificial stake.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:3:3">11:7:3:3</span></span>3. And
such a one as is bent at the top, and bent outwards <span
id="fr_386"></span>[1](#fn_386.md) in the middle, is a type of hunger
(poverty); and if any one makes such a one his sacrificial stake, his
dependants will certainly be hungry; therefore let no one wishing for
food make such a one his sacrificial stake. But such a one as is bent at
the top and bent inwards in the middle, is a type of food (prosperity):
therefore let him who wishes for food make such a one his sacrificial
stake.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_384"></span>[123:1](sbe44039.htm#fr_384.md) That is, as would
seem, made of very hard wood. It cannot mean 'pithy,' because at [XIII,
4, 4, 9](sbe44105.htm#13:4:4:9), the Khadira (acacia catechu.md), a tree of
very hard, solid wood, is mentioned as 'bahusâra.'

<span id="fn_385"></span>[123:2](sbe44039.htm#fr_385.md) Either 'that which
has a pigeon (sitting) on it' (kapotin, viz. yûpa), or, as Sâya*n*a
takes it, fem. of 'kapota,'--a female pigeon; i.e. a tree too much
pointed at the top.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[124:1](sbe44039.htm#fr_386.md) That is, as would
seem, bent to the opposite side from that towards which the top tends.
