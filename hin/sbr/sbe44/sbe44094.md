### THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:1:1">13:3:1:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati's eye swelled; it fell out: thence the horse was produced;
and inasmuch as it swelled (a*s*vayat), that is the origin and nature of
the horse (a*s*va). By means of the A*s*vamedha the gods restored it to
its place; and verily he who performs the A*s*vamedha makes Pra*g*âpati
complete, and he (himself) becomes complete; and this, indeed, is the
atonement for everything, the remedy for everything. Thereby the gods
redeem all sin, yea, even the slaying of a Brahman <span
id="fr_839"></span>[1](#fn_835.md) they thereby redeem; and he who performs
the A*s*vamedha redeems all sin, he redeems the slaying of a Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:1:2">13:3:1:2</span></span>2. It
was the left eye of Pra*g*âpati that swelled: hence they cut off the
(meat) portions from the left.

side of the horse, and from the right side of other victims.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:1:3">13:3:1:3</span></span>3.
There is a rattan mat, for the horse was produced from the womb of the
waters, and the rattan springs from the water: he thus brings it in
connection with its own (maternal) womb.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:1:4">13:3:1:4</span></span>4. The
*K*atush*t*oma <span id="fr_840"></span>[1](#fn_836.md) is the form of
chanting (on

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

the first day); for a bee tore out <span id="fr_841"></span>[1](#fn_837.md)
(a piece of) the horse's thigh, and by means of the Katush*t*oma form of
chanting the gods restored it: thus when there is the Katush*t*oma mode
of chanting, it is for the completeness of the horse. The last day is an
Atirâtra with all the Stomas <span id="fr_842"></span>[2](#fn_838.md)--with
a view to his obtaining and securing everything, for an Atirâtra with
all the Stomas is everything, and the A*s*vamedha is everything.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_835"></span>[328:1](sbe44094.htm#fr_839.md) See [XIII, 3, 5,
3](sbe44098.htm#13:3:5:3.md) seq.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[329:1](sbe44094.htm#fr_840.md) The term
Katush*t*oma originally apparently means a sacrificial performance, or
succession of chants, in which four different Stomas, or hymn-forms, are
used. Hence, in Tâ*nd*ya-Br. VI, 3, 16, the name is applied to the
ordinary Agnish*t*oma, for its twelve Stotras, or chants, require the
first four normal Stomas (Triv*ri*t, Pa*ñk*ada*s*a, Saptada*s*a,
Ekavi*ms*a). The term has, however, assumed the special meaning of a
hymnic performance, the different Stomas of which (begin with the
four-versed one, and) successively increase by four verses (cf. [XIII,
5, 1, 1](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:1).md). In this sense, two different forms of
*K*atush*t*oma are in use, one being applicable to an Agnish*t*oma, the
other to a Sho*d*a*s*in, sacrifice. Whilst this latter form requires
only four different Stomas (of 4, 8, 12, 16 verses resp.) and thus
combines the original meaning of '*k*atush*t*oma' with its special
meaning, the Agnish*t*oma form, used on the first of the three days of
the A*s*vamedha, requires six Stomas, ascending from the four-versed up
to the twenty-four-versed one. In regard to this latter occasion,
Sâya*n*a on Tâ*nd*ya-Br. XXI, 4, 1, curiously enough, seems to take
'katush*t*oma' in its original senses, since he speaks of this first day
of the A*s*vamedha as an Agnish*t*oma with four Stomas, beginning with
Triv*ri*t; whilst on ib. XIX, 5, 1 seq. he gives the correct
explanation. As to the distribution of the six Stomas over the chants of
the first day, see [XIII, 5, 1, 1](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:1.md). The
*k*atush*t*oma has, however, another peculiarity, which, in Lâ*t*y. S.
VI, 8, 1 (or at least by the commentator Agnisvâmin thereon), is taken
as that which has given its name to this form of chanting, viz. that
each stotra performed in it is chanted in four, instead of the ordinary
three, paryâyas or turns of verses (see part ii, p. 350 note). The
Bahishpavamâna-stotra is to be performed on three anush*t*ubh verses
(consisting each of four octosyllabic pâdas) which, however, by taking
each time three pâdas to make up a verse, are transformed into four
verses, constituting at the same time the four paryâyas of the Stotra.
As regards the exact <span id="page_330">p. 330</span> text to be used
there seems to be some doubt, Sâmav. S. II, 366-8 (pavasva vâ*g*asâtaye)
being mentioned by Sâya*n*a on Tâ*nd*ya-Br. XXI, 4, 5; whilst on XIX, 5,
2 he gives S. V. II, 168-70 (ayam pûshâ rayir bhaga*h*) as the text to
be used--but apparently only when the performance is that of an ekâha
(one day's sacrifice) proper, instead of one of the days of an âhîna
sacrifice, as is the case in the three days’ A*s*vamedha. As regards the
Â*g*ya-stotras to be chanted on the eight-versed Stoma, the text of each
of them consists of three gâyatrî-verses: these are to be chanted in
four turns (paryâya) of two verses each, viz. either 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 1
and 2, 2 and 3;--or 1 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 2, 3 and 3;--(or 1 and 1, 1
and 1, 2 and 2, 3 and 3;--or 1 and 1, 2 and 2, 2 and 2, 3 and 3). By
similar manipulations the subsequent Stomas are formed.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[330:1](sbe44094.htm#fr_841.md) Or, wounded, as
Sâya*n*a takes 'â b*ri*hat,' on Tâ*nd*ya-Br. XXI, 4, 4 (vra*n*a*m*
*k*akâra).

<span id="fn_838"></span>[330:2](sbe44094.htm#fr_842.md) The Atirâtra
sarvastoma is arranged in such a way that the six principal Stomas are
used successively first in the ascending, and then again in the
descending, or reversed, order as is explained in [XIII, 5, 3,
10](sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:10.md).
