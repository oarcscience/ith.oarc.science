### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:4:1">13:2:4:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati desired, 'Would that I might gain both worlds, the world of
the gods, and the world of men.' He saw those beasts, the tame and the
wild ones; he seized them, and by means of them took possession of these
two worlds: by means of the tame beasts he took possession of this
(terrestrial) world, and by means of the wild beasts of yonder (world);
for this world is the world of men, and yonder world is the world of the
gods. Thus when he seizes tame beasts he thereby takes possession of
this world, and when wild beasts, he thereby (takes possession) of
yonder (world).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:4:2">13:2:4:2</span></span>2. Were
he to complete (the sacrifice) with tame ones, the roads would run
together <span id="fr_780"></span>[3](#fn_776.md), the village-boundaries

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

of two villages would be contiguous <span
id="fr_781"></span>[1](#fn_777.md), and no ogres <span
id="fr_782"></span>[2](#fn_778.md), man-tigers, thieves, murderers, and
robbers would come to be in the forests. By (so doing) with wild
(beasts) the roads would run asunder <span
id="fr_783"></span>[3](#fn_779.md), the village-boundaries of two villages
would be far asunder <span id="fr_784"></span>[4](#fn_780.md); and there
would come to be ogres, man-tigers, thieves, murderers, and robbers in
the forests.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:4:3">13:2:4:3</span></span>3. As
to this they say, 'Surely that--to wit, the forest (beast)--is not a
beast (or cattle), and offering should not be made thereof: were he to
make offering thereof, they would ere long carry away the Sacrificer
dead to the woods, for forest (or wild) beasts have the forest for their
share; and were he not to make offering thereof, it would be a violation
of the sacrifice.' Well, they dismiss them after fire has been carried
around them <span id="fr_785"></span>[5](#fn_781.md): thus, indeed, it is

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

neither an offering nor a non-offering, and they do not carry the
Sacrificer dead to the forest, and there is no violation of the
sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:4:4">13:2:4:4</span></span>4. He
completes (the sacrifice) with tame (beasts),--father and son part
company <span id="fr_786"></span>[1](#fn_782.md), the roads run together,
the village-boundaries of two villages become contiguous, and no ogres,
man-tigers, thieves, murderers, and robbers come to be in the forests.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_776"></span>[306:3](sbe44086.htm#fr_780.md) The commentary
remarks that by 'roads' here is meant those walking on them--as, in that
case, peace and security would reign, men would range all the
lands:--adhvabhir atrâdhvasthâ lakshyante; ksheme sati manushyâ*h*
sarvân de*s*ân sa*mk*areyur ity abhiprâya*h*.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[307:1](sbe44086.htm#fr_781.md) Harisvâmin takes
'samantikam' in the sense of 'near' and construes it with 'grâmayo*h*'
(as he does 'vidûram' in the next paragraph)--'the two
village-boundaries would be near (far from) the two villages;' but see
I, 4, 1, 22, where samantikam (and IX, 3, 1, 11, where 'samantikataram')
is likewise used without a complement; as is 'vidûram' in I, 4, 1, 23.

<span id="fn_778"></span>[307:2](sbe44086.htm#fr_782.md) Harisvâmin takes
'*ri*kshîkâ' to 'mean 'a bear;'--*ri*kshâ eva *ri*kshîkâ*h*.

<span id="fn_779"></span>[307:3](sbe44086.htm#fr_783.md) Hardly as the
commentary takes it, 'they would become blocked up,' and people would
have to stay in their own country:--adhvâna*h* pûrvade*s*âdayo
vikrameyur, viruddha*m* krâmayeyu*h* (!), svade*s*a eva manushyâ*h*
sa*mk*areyur na de*s*ântare<sup>ऽ</sup>py antarâlânâm . . bhinnatvâd
akshematvâ*k* *k*a vidûra*m* grâmayor grâmântau syâtâm.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[307:4](sbe44086.htm#fr_784.md) Viz. because, for
want of security and peace, the villages would be few and far
between,--aksheme hi sati praviralâ grâmâ bhavanti, comm.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[307:5](sbe44086.htm#fr_785.md) On the
'paryagnikara*n*am' or circumambulation of an oblation in accordance
with the course of the sun, whilst holding a firebrand in one's hand,
see part i, p. 45, note; part ii, p, 187, note.

<span id="fn_782"></span>[308:1](sbe44086.htm#fr_786.md) Or, they exert
themselves in different directions,--that is, as the commentator
explains, because in peace they would not be forced to keep together, as
they would have to do in troublous times. He, however, seems somehow to
connect 'vy avasyata*h*' with the root 'vas':--ksheme hi sati pitâputrâv
atra vi p*ri*thag vasata*h*; aksheme tu sambaddhâv apy etâv atra
vasata*h*.--Whilst in this passage the verb would hardly suggest an
estrangement between father and son, this is distinctly the case in the
parallel passage, Taitt. Br. III, 9, I, 2, where, however, this
contingency is connected with the completion of the sacrifice, not, as
here, with tame, but with wild beasts.
