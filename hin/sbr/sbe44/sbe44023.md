### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE MITRAVINDÂ SACRIFICE.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:1">11:4:3:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati was becoming heated (by fervid devotion), whilst creating
living beings <span id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_216.md). From him, worn out
and heated, *S*rî (Fortune and Beauty) came forth. She stood there
resplendent, shining, and trembling <span
id="fr_217"></span>[2](#fn_217.md). The gods, beholding her thus
resplendent, shining, and trembling, set their minds upon her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:2">11:4:3:2</span></span>2. They
said to Pra*g*âpati, 'Let us kill her and take (all) this from her.' He
said, 'Surely, that *S*rî is a woman, and people do not kill a woman,
but rather take (anything) from her (leaving her) alive.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:3">11:4:3:3</span></span>3. Agni
then took her food, Soma her royal power, Varu*n*a her universal
*s*overeignty, Mitra her noble rank, Indra her power, B*ri*haspati her
holy lustre, Savit*ri* her dominion, Pûshan her wealth, Sarasvatî her
prosperity, and Tvash*tri* her beautiful forms.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:4">11:4:3:4</span></span>4. She
said to Pra*g*âpati, 'Surely, they have taken (all) this from me!' He
said, 'Do thou ask it back from them by sacrifice!'

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:5">11:4:3:5</span></span>5. She
perceived this offering with ten sacrificial dishes--a cake on eight
potsherds for Agni, a pap for Soma, a cake on ten potsherds for
Varu*n*a, a pap for Mitra, a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra, a pap
for B*ri*haspati, a cake on twelve or eight potsherds for Savit*ri*, a
pap for Pûshan, a pap for Sarasvatî, and a cake on ten potsherds for
Tvash*tri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:6">11:4:3:6</span></span>6. She
invited them by means of this invitatory formula,--'May Agni, Soma,
Varu*n*a, Mitra, Indra, B*ri*haspati, and the thousandfold-bestowing
Savit*ri*,--May Pûshan, for our Sacrifices, unite us with cattle,
Sarasvatî with favour, Tvash*tri* with beautiful forms!' They
accordingly made their appearance again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:7">11:4:3:7</span></span>7. By
this offering-formula she then approached them in inverted order
(beginning) from the last:--'May Tvash*tri* grant me forms, and the
bountiful Sarasvatî, and Pûshan good fortune, and may Savit*ri* bestow
gifts on me, and Indra power, and Mitra noble rank, and Varu*n*a, and
Soma and Agni!' They were ready to restore them to her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:8">11:4:3:8</span></span>8. She
perceived these additional oblations:--'May Agni, the food-eater, the
food-lord, bestow food upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!' Agni, taking
the oblation, departed and restored her food to her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:9">11:4:3:9</span></span>9. 'May
Soma, the king, the lord of kings, bestow royal power upon me at this
sacrifice, svâhâ!' Soma, taking the oblation, departed and restored her
royal power to her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:10">11:4:3:10</span></span>10.
'May Varu*n*a, the universal sovereign, the lord of universal
sovereigns, bestow universal sovereignty upon me at this sacrifice,

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

svâhâ!' Varu*n*a, taking the oblation, departed and restored her
universal sovereignty to her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:11">11:4:3:11</span></span>11.
'May Mitra, the Kshatra (nobility), the lord of the Kshatra, bestow
noble rank upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!' Mitra, taking the
oblation, departed and restored her noble rank to her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:12">11:4:3:12</span></span>12.
'May Indra, the power, the lord of power, bestow power upon me at this
sacrifice, svâhâ!' Indra, taking the oblation, departed and restored her
power to her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:13">11:4:3:13</span></span>13.
'May B*ri*haspati, the Brahman (priesthood), the lord of the Brahman,
bestow holy lustre upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!' B*ri*haspati,
taking the oblation, departed and restored her holy lustre to her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:14">11:4:3:14</span></span>14.
'May Savit*ri*, the kingdom, the lord of the kingdom, bestow the kingdom
upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!' Savit*ri*, taking the oblation,
departed and restored her kingdom to her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:15">11:4:3:15</span></span>15.
'May Pûshan, wealth, the lord of wealth, bestow wealth upon me at this
sacrifice, svâhâ!' Pûshan, taking the oblation, departed and restored
her wealth to her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:16">11:4:3:16</span></span>16.
'May Sarasvatî, prosperity <span id="fr_218"></span>[1](#fn_218.md), the
lord of prosperity, bestow prosperity upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!'
Sarasvatî, taking the oblation, departed and restored her prosperity to
her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:17">11:4:3:17</span></span>17.
'May Tvash*tri*, the fashioner of forms,

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

the lord of forms, bestow cattle with form <span
id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_219.md) upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!'
Tvash*tri*, taking the oblation, departed and restored her cattle with
(beautiful) form to her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:18">11:4:3:18</span></span>18.
These, then, are ten deities, ten sacrificial dishes, . ten offerings,
ten presents to priests,--the Virâ*g* consists of decad after decad (of
syllables), and the Virâ*g* (shining one) is *S*rî (beauty, prosperity):
he thus establishes (the Sacrificer) in the Virâ*g*, in prosperity and
food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:19">11:4:3:19</span></span>19.
For this (sacrifice) there are fifteen kindling-verses <span
id="fr_220"></span>[2](#fn_220.md): he offers to the deities in a low
voice <span id="fr_221"></span>[3](#fn_221.md). There are five
fore-offerings, three after-offerings, and one Samish*t*aya*g*us. The
(formulas of the) two butter-portions contain the word
'affluence':--(*Ri*g-veda S. I, 1, 3), 'Through Agni may he obtain
wealth and affluence day by day, famous and abounding in
heroes;'--(*Ri*g-veda S. I, 91, 12), 'An increaser of the house, a
remover of trouble, a procurer of wealth, an augmenter of affluence, a
kind friend he thou unto us, O Soma!' The two formulas of the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t contain the word 'thousand':--(*Ri*g-veda S. III, 13,
7), 'Grant thou unto us wealth, a thousandfold, with offspring and
affluence, and glorious manhood, O Agni, most excellent and never

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

failing!'--(*Ri*g-veda S. III, 13, 6), 'Favour thou our prayer, as the
best invoker of the gods for our hymns: blaze up auspiciously for us,
wind-fanned, O Agni, the dispenser of a thousand bounties!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:3:20">11:4:3:20</span></span>20.
Now, indeed, it was Gotama Râhûga*n*a who discovered this (sacrifice).
It went away to *G*anaka of Videha, and he searched for it in the
Brâhma*n*as versed in the Aṅgas <span id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_222.md)
(limbs of the Veda), and found it in Yâ*gñ*avalkya. He said, 'A thousand
we give thee, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya, in whom we have found that Mitravindâ.'
He finds (vind) Mitra, and his is the kingdom, he conquers recurring
death <span id="fr_223"></span>[2](#fn_223.md) and gains all life,
whosoever, knowing this, performs this sacrifice; or whosoever thus
knows it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_216"></span>[62:1](sbe44023.htm#fr_216.md) That is, gods, men,
&c., Sây.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[62:2](sbe44023.htm#fr_217.md) Sâya*n*a apparently
takes 'lelâyantî' in the sense of 'all-embracing' (from lîyate, to
nestle against),--dîpyamânâ avayavai*h* *s*obhamânâ bhrâ*g*amânâ
sarva*m* *g*agat svate*g*asâ prakâ*s*ayantî svakîyena te*g*a*h*pu*ñg*ena
sarvam â*s*lishyantî atish*th*at sthitavatî.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[64:1](sbe44023.htm#fr_218.md) I read
'push*t*i*h*' instead of 'push*t*im.' Sâya*n*a takes it thus,--whatever
prosperity Sarasvatî, the lord of prosperity, took from me, may he
bestow that prosperity upon me!

<span id="fn_219"></span>[65:1](sbe44023.htm#fr_219.md) Sâya*n*a supplies
'vi*s*ish*t*ân,'--cattle endowed with form.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[65:2](sbe44023.htm#fr_220.md) That is, the
ordinary number of sâmidhenîs at an ish*t*i, viz. eleven verses, the
first and last of which are recited three times each. See part i, p.
102, note 1; p. 112, note 1.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[65:3](sbe44023.htm#fr_221.md) That is, the
formulas--with the exception of the final 'om' of the invitatory
formulas, and the introduction 'ye ya*g*âmahe' and the final 'vausha*t*'
of the offering-formulas--are pronounced in a low voice.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[66:1](sbe44023.htm#fr_222.md) That is, the
Vedâṅgas, i.e. the limbs, or supplementary sciences, of the Veda.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[66:2](sbe44023.htm#fr_223.md) That is to say, his
approaching death will deliver him once for all from mundane existence
and its constantly repeated round of birth and death.
