### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:3:1">11:2:3:1</span></span>1.
Verily, in the beginning, this (universe) was the Brahman (neut.) <span
id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_136.md). It created the gods; and, having
created the gods, it made them ascend these worlds: Agni this
(terrestrial) world, Vâyu the air, and Sûrya the sky.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:3:2">11:2:3:2</span></span>2. And
the deities who are above these he made ascend the worlds which are
above these; and, indeed, just as these (three) worlds and these (three)
deities are manifest, so are those (higher) worlds and those (higher)
deities manifest--(the worlds) which he made those deities ascend.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:3:3">11:2:3:3</span></span>3. Then
the Brahman itself went up to the sphere beyond. Having gone up to the
sphere beyond, it considered, 'How can I descend again into these
worlds?' It then descended again by means of these two--Form and Name.
Whatever has a name,

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

that is name; and that again which has no name, and which one knows by
its form, 'This is (of a certain) form,' that is form: as far as there
are Form and Name so far, indeed, extends this (universe).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:3:4">11:2:3:4</span></span>4.
These, indeed, are the two great forces of the Brahman; and, verily, he
who knows these two great forces of the Brahman becomes himself a great
force.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:3:5">11:2:3:5</span></span>5.
These, indeed, are the two great manifestations <span
id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_137.md) of the Brahman; and, verily, he who
knows these two great manifestations of the Brahman becomes himself a
great manifestation. One of these two is the greater, namely Form; for
whatever is Name, is indeed Form; and, verily, he who knows the greater
of these two, becomes greater than he whom he wishes to surpass in
greatness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:3:6">11:2:3:6</span></span>6. In
the beginning, indeed, the gods were mortal, and only when they had
become possessed <span id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_138.md) of the Brahman
they were immortal. Now, when he makes the libation to Mind <span
id="fr_139"></span>[3](#fn_139.md)--form being mind, inasmuch as it is by
mind that one knows, 'This is form'--he thereby obtains Form; and when
he makes the libation to Speech--name being speech, inasmuch as it is by
speech that he seizes (mentions) the name--he thereby obtains Name;--as
far as there are Form and Name, so far, indeed, extends this whole
(universe): all this he obtains; and--the

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

all being the imperishable--imperishable merit and the imperishable
world thus accrue to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:3:7">11:2:3:7</span></span>7.
There, on the occasion of the offering to Agni <span
id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_140.md), it has been told how the sacrifice then
pleased the *Ri*shis, and how they performed it. Now, when the *Ri*shis
were performing the sacrifice, the Gandharvas came nigh to them. They
looked on, thinking, 'Here, surely, they have done too much,--here they
have done too little.' And when their sacrifice was completed, they
pointed it out to them, saying, 'Here, surely, ye have done too
much,--here ye have done too little.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:3:8">11:2:3:8</span></span>8. Now,
wherever they had done too much it was like a hill; and wherever they
had done too little it was like a pit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:3:9">11:2:3:9</span></span>9. Now,
when he pronounces the *S*amyos (all-hail and blessing), he touches (the
earth <span id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_141)) with (Vâ*g*. S. II, 19.md), 'O
Sacrifice, homage be unto thee: mayest thou complete thy course up to
the success of the sacrifice and up to mine own right offering!'
Wherever (in the course of the sacrifice) he has committed any excess,
he makes amends for it by doing homage; and wherever he has left
anything defective, it ceases to be defective by his saying, 'up to.' In
saying, 'Mayest thou complete thy course up to the success of the
sacrifice,'--success being whatever in the sacrifice is neither
defective nor excessive--he thereby makes amends for both of these
(mistakes); and in saying, 'Mayest thou complete thy

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

course up to mine own right offering,'--right offering being whatever in
the sacrifice is neither defective nor excessive--he thereby also makes
amends for both of these (mistakes); and thus that sacrifice of his
comes to be performed as one that is neither defective nor excessive by
whosoever, knowing this, thus touches (the earth): let him therefore
touch it just in this way. But, indeed, those Gandharvas were Yavamân
(rich in barley), the winnowing-basket; Uddâlavân (rich in paspalum
frumentaceum), husbandry; and Antarvân (the pregnant), grain <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_142.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_136"></span>[27:2](sbe44013.htm#fr_136.md) On this speculative
myth, see John Muir, Orig. S. Texts, vol. v, pp. 387-89.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[28:1](sbe44013.htm#fr_137.md) Or,
phantasmagories, illusive representations.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[28:2](sbe44013.htm#fr_138.md) The use of 'âp'
with the instrumental (brahma*n*â âpu*h*) is peculiar,--brahma*n*â
vyâptâ*h*, Sây.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[28:3](sbe44013.htm#fr_139.md) The two libations
(âghâra) of ghee, forming the first oblations of an ish*t*i, made on the
newly kindled fire, are offered to Mind and Speech respectively; cf.
part i, p. 224 seqq.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[29:1](sbe44013.htm#fr_140.md) Sâya*n*a explains
this by 'âdhânakara*n*e'; but the passage referred to occurs I, 6, 2, 3.
4, in connection with the first butter-portion (â*g*yabhâga), that of
Agni.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[29:2](sbe44013.htm#fr_141.md) Or, perhaps, the
altar; see I, 9, 1, 29.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[30:1](sbe44013.htm#fr_142.md) On these names,
Sâya*n*a merely remarks,--te gandharvâ*h* *s*ûrpâdibhâvam âpannâ
babhûvu*h*, yavamân ityâdyâs teshâ*m* sa*mgñ*â*h*.--Mahîdhara, on the
other hand, on Vâ*g*. S. II, 19, makes them to be five names, Yavamat,
*S*ûrpa (n.), Uddâlavat, K*ri*shi (f.), and Dhânântarvat. This is very
improbable; the last name, especially, being accented on the first
syllable, showing it to be two words.
