### EIGHTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:8:1">13:2:8:1</span></span>1. Now
the gods, when going upwards, did not know (the way to) the heavenly
world, but the horse knew it: when they go upwards with the horse, it is
in order to know (the way to) the heavenly world. 'A cloth, an upper
cloth, and gold,' this <span id="fr_819"></span>[1](#fn_815.md) is what
they spread out for the horse <span id="fr_820"></span>[2](#fn_816.md):

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

thereon they quiet (slay) it, as (is done) for no other victim; and thus
they separate it from the other victims.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:8:2">13:2:8:2</span></span>2. When
they quiet a victim they kill it. Whilst it is being quieted, he (the
Adhvaryu) offers (three) oblations <span
id="fr_821"></span>[1](#fn_817), with (Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 18.md), 'To the
breath hail! to the off-breathing hail! to the through-breathing hail!'
he thereby lays the vital airs into it, and thus offering is made by him
with this victim as a living one <span id="fr_822"></span>[2](#fn_818.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:8:3">13:2:8:3</span></span>3.
With, 'Ambâ! Ambikâ! Ambâlikâ <span id="fr_823"></span>[3](#fn_819.md)!
there is no one to lead me,'--he leads up the (four)

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

wives <span id="fr_824"></span>[1](#fn_820.md): he thereby has called upon
them (to come), and, indeed, also renders them sacrificially pure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:8:4">13:2:8:4</span></span>4. With
(Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 19), 'We call upon thee, the host-leader of (divine)
hosts, O my true lord!' the wives walk round (the horse), and thus make
amends to it for that (slaughtering <span
id="fr_825"></span>[2](#fn_821)): even thereby they (already.md) make
amends to it; but,

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

indeed, they also fan <span id="fr_826"></span>[1](#fn_822.md) it. Thrice
they walk round <span id="fr_827"></span>[2](#fn_823.md); for three (in
number) are these worlds: by means of these worlds they fan it. Thrice
again they walk round <span id="fr_828"></span>[3](#fn_824.md),--that
amounts to six, for there are six seasons: by means of the seasons they
fan it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:8:5">13:2:8:5</span></span>5. But,
indeed, the vital airs depart from those who perform the fanning at the
sacrifice. Nine times they walk round <span
id="fr_829"></span>[4](#fn_825.md); for there are nine vital airs: vital
airs they thus put into their own selves, and the vital airs do not
depart from them. 'I will urge the seed-layer, urge thou the
seed-layer!' (the Mahishî says <span
id="fr_830"></span>[5](#fn_826).md);--seed, doubtless, means offspring and
cattle: offspring and cattle she thus secures for herself. \[Vâ*g*. S.
XXIII, 20,\] 'Let us stretch our feet,' thus in order to secure union.
'In heaven ye envelop yourselves' (the Adhvaryu says),--for that is,
indeed, heaven where they immolate the victim: therefore he

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

speaks thus.--'May the vigorous male, the layer of seed, lay seed!' she
says in order to secure union.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_815"></span>[320:1](sbe44090.htm#fr_819.md) The 'iti' seems
superfluous; Harisvâmin explains it by 'etat trayam.' For a similar use
of the particle, see [XIII, 2, 2, 1](sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:1.md).

<span id="fn_816"></span>[320:2](sbe44090.htm#fr_820.md) That is, they
spread them on the ground for the horse to lie upon. Differently St.
Petersb. Dict., 'they spread over the horse;' but see Kâty. XX, 6, 10
comm.; and Harisvâmin:--vâso yad antardhânâyâlam, adhivâso yad
â*kkh*âdanâyâlam, ta*k* *k*a vâsasa upari stara*n*îya*m*, tayor upari
hira*n*ya*m* nidheyam, tasmi*m*s traye enam adhi upari
sa*mgñ*apayanti;--and he then remarks that these three objects here do
not take the place of the stalk of grass which, in the ordinary animal
sacrifice, is thrown on the place where the victim is to be killed and
cut up (III, 8, 1, 14; Kâty. VI, 5, 15-16), but that the stalk is
likewise put down on this occasion. Similarly the comm. on Kâtyâyana,
where it is stated that the stalk of grass (or straw) is first laid
down, and then the others thereon. Indeed, as was the case in regard to
the stalk of grass--representing the barhis, or layer of sacrificial
grass on the vedi--so here the fourfold underlayer is intended to
prevent any part of the sacrificial material (havis)--the victim in this
case--from being spilt. The <span id="page_321">p. 321</span> upper
garment (or cloth) must be sufficiently large to allow its being
afterwards turned up so as to cover the horse and the queen consort.

<span id="fn_817"></span>[321:1](sbe44090.htm#fr_821.md) Prior to these,
however, he offers the two 'Paripa*s*avya,' i.e. 'oblations relating to
the victim,'--or, perhaps, 'oblations performed in connection with the
carrying of fire round the victim,' for this last ceremony is performed
for all the victims (whereupon the wild beasts placed between the stakes
are let loose) before the killing of the horse. See III, 8, 1, 6-16.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[321:2](sbe44090.htm#fr_822.md) For the symbolic
import of this, see III, 8, 2, 4.

<span id="fn_819"></span>[321:3](sbe44090.htm#fr_823.md) These are just
three variants used in addressing a mother (Mutter, Mütterchen,
Mütterlein), or, indeed, as here, any woman (good lady! good woman!.
Acc. to Kâty. XX, 6, 12, this is the formula which the assistant priest
(the Nesh*tri*, or, according to others, the Pratiprasthât*ri*, cf.
Kâty. VI, 5, 27-28) makes the king's wives say whilst leading them up to
the slain horse to cleanse it. It is, moreover, to be preceded by the
formula used, at this juncture, at the ordinary animal sacrifice, viz.
'Homage be to thee, O wide-stretched one, advance unresisted unto the
rivers of ghee, along the paths of sacred truth! Ye divine, pure waters,
carry ye (the sacrifice) to the gods, well-prepared! may ye be
well-prepared preparers!' (III, 8, 2, 2-3). The words 'Ambâ!' &c. are,
according to Mahîdhara, addressed by the women to one another. The
latter part of the formula as given in the Vâ*g* . Sa*m*h. (viz. 'the
horse sleeps near Subhadrikâ, dwelling in Kâmpîla') is apparently <span
id="page_322">p. 322</span> rejected (? as antiquated, or inauspicious)
by the author of the Brâhma*n*a. The ceremony of lying near the dead
horse being looked upon as assuring fertility to a woman, the formula
used here is also doubtless meant to express an eagerness on the part of
the women to be led to the slaughtered horse, representing the lord of
creatures, Pra*g*âpati. On this passage compare the remarks of Professor
Weber (Ind. Stud. I, p. 183), who takes the formula to be spoken by the
queen consort to her three fellow-wives; and who also translates the
words 'na mâ nayati ka*s* *k*ana' (nobody leads me) by 'nobody shall
lead me (by force to the horse; but if I do not go) the (wicked) horse
will lie near (another woman such as) the (wicked) Subadhrâ living in
Kâmpîla.'--Harisvâmin's commentary on this passage is rather corrupt,
but he seems at all events to assume that each of the four wives
apostrophizes the others with the above formula (probably substituting
their real names for the words 'ambâ,' &c.):--lepsam (? lipsâ*m*) tâvad
esha patnîvaktraka*h* (? patnîvakirata*h*) prâpnoti, katham, ekaikâ hi
patnî itarâs tisra âmantrya *s*eshâ*h* paridevayamânâ d*ris*yate, he
ambe he ambike he ambâlike yûyam apu*n*yâ nîshpâdotv asya (?) samîpa*m*,
sa *k*a pakshapâtî kutsito<sup>ऽ</sup>svako mayi yushmâka*m* sasasti
meva (!) subhadrikâ*m* kâmpîlavâsinîm ida (? iha) surûpâ*m* na tu mâ*m*
ka*sk*it tatra nayatîti; sasastîty eva vartamânasâmîpye vartamânavad
(Pâ*n*. III, 3, 131) ity âsannasevane drash*t*avya*h*.--This barbarous
ceremony was evidently an old indigenous custom too firmly established
in popular practice to be easily excluded from the sacrificial ritual.
That it had nothing to do with Vedic religion and was distasteful to the
author of the Brâhma*n*a is evident from the brief way in which he
refers to it, and from the far-fetched symbolic explanations attached to
the formulas and discourses.

<span id="fn_820"></span>[322:1](sbe44090.htm#fr_824.md) Viz. from their
ordinary place near the Gârhapatya he leads them whilst holding jars of
water in their hands.

<span id="fn_821"></span>[322:2](sbe44090.htm#fr_825.md) Apahnuvate
vismaranty evâsmai etat pradakshi*n*âvartanena sa*mgñ*apanam unnayanti,
comm.

<span id="fn_822"></span>[323:1](sbe44090.htm#fr_826.md) Thus
Harisvâmin:--dhuvate dhûnane(na) upavâ*g*ayanti, evam a*s*va*m*
râ*g*ânam iva vya*g*anair etat,--'they shake themselves,' St. Petersb.
Dict.; and, indeed, it is doubtless by the flutter of the garments
produced in walking round first one way and then another, that the
fanning is supposed to be produced.

<span id="fn_823"></span>[323:2](sbe44090.htm#fr_827.md) Viz. in sunwise
fashion (pradakshi*n*â), that is so as to keep the object
circumambulated on one's right side.

<span id="fn_824"></span>[323:3](sbe44090.htm#fr_828.md) Viz. in the
opposite, the 'apradakshi*n*a*m*' way, as is done in the sacrifice to
the departed ancestors. They do so with the text, 'We call upon thee,
the dear Lord of the dear ones, O my true lord!'

<span id="fn_825"></span>[323:4](sbe44090.htm#fr_829.md) Viz. another three
times in the sunwise way. Having completed their circumambulation, the
king's wives cleanse the horse's apertures of the vital airs (mouth,
nostrils, eyes, &c.), as the Sacrificer's wife did at the ordinary
animal sacrifice (III, 8, 2, 4), which they do with the text, 'We call
upon thee, the treasure-lord of treasures, O my true lord!'

<span id="fn_826"></span>[323:5](sbe44090.htm#fr_830.md) Cf. III, 5, 2, 1
seqq.
