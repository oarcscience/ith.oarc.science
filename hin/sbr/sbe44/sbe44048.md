### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:4:1">12:1:4:1</span></span>1. The
Year, indeed, is Man;--the opening (prâya*n*îya) Atirâtra is his feet,
for by means of their

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

feet (men) go forward (prayanti): that part of them which is white is of
the form of the day, and that which is black is (of the form) of the
night; the nails are of the form of herbs and trees. The *K*aturvi*ms*a
day is the thighs, the Abhiplava the breast, and the P*ri*sh*th*ya the
back.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:4:2">12:1:4:2</span></span>2. The
Abhi*g*it is this right arm, the Svarasâman days these three (openings
of the) vital airs on the right side <span
id="fr_439"></span>[1](#fn_439.md) the Vishuvat the head, and the (second
period of) Svarasâman days these three vital airs on the left side.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:4:3">12:1:4:3</span></span>3. The
Vi*s*va*g*it is this left arm,--the P*ri*sh*th*ya and Abhiplava have
been told,--the Go and Âyus those downward vital airs; the Da*s*arâtra
the limbs, the Mahâvrata the mouth; and the concluding (udayanîya)
Atirâtra is the hands, for by means of the hands (men) move (reach)
upwards (udyanti) that part of them which is white is of the form of the
day, and that which is black is of that of the night; and the nails are
of the form of the stars. Thus that year is established in respect of
the body; and, verily, whosoever thus knows that year to be established
in respect of the body, establishes himself by means of offspring and
cattle in this, and by immortality in the other, world.
