### NINTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:1">12:9:1:1</span></span>1.
Verily, from this sacrifice the man <span
id="fr_658"></span>[5](#fn_655.md) is born

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

and whatever food a man consumes in this world, that (food), in return,
consumes him in yonder world. Now this sacrifice is performed by means
of spirituous liquor, and spirituous liquor (parisrut) is not to be
consumed by a Brâhma*n*a: he thus is born from that which is not (to be)
consumed, and the food does not, in return, consume him in yonder world.
Therefore this (sacrifice), the Sautrâma*n*î, is a Brâhma*n*a's
sacrifice <span id="fr_659"></span>[1](#fn_656.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:2">12:9:1:2</span></span>2. The
malted rice is the same as his (the man's) hair, the malted barley his
skin, the fried rice his flesh, the filtering-cloth his bones, the mash
his marrow, the raw liquor (parisrut) his life-sap (serum), the
seasoning (and fermentative substances) his blood, the milk his seed,
the mature liquor (surâ) his urine, and the impure matter the contents
of the stomach.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:3">12:9:1:3</span></span>3.
Indra's cake is his heart, that of Savit*ri* his liver, that of Varu*n*a
his lung, the a*s*vattha and udumbara vessels his kidneys, the nyagrodha
one his bile, the pan (sthâlî) his intestines <span
id="fr_660"></span>[2](#fn_657), the supernumerary (vessels.md) his
bowels <span id="fr_661"></span>[2](#fn_657.md), the two eagle
feathers <span id="fr_662"></span>[3](#fn_658.md) the milt, the throne-seat
his navel, the pot his rectum, the (pan) perforated with a hundred
holes, the male organ,--and inasmuch as that (pan) is much perforated,
therefore that organ is much divided,--the bowl (sata) is his mouth, the
strainer

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

his tongue, the dish (*k*apya) his anus, the tail (whisk) his bladder,

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:4">12:9:1:4</span></span>4. And
the sacrificial animal of the A*s*vins is his limbs, that of Sarasvatî
his trunk, Indra's bull his form,--whence they say that man's form
(wealth) is kine,--the gold (plate) is his vital strength; it is of the
weight of a hundred (grains), whence mark has a life of a hundred
(years).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:5">12:9:1:5</span></span>5. The
two cups of the A*s*vins are his eyes, and the ground wheat and kuvala
(jujubes) his eyelashes; the two cups of Sarasvatî are his nostrils, and
the ground Indra-grain and badara (jujubes) the hair in his nostrils;
the two cups of Indra are his ears, and the ground barley and karkandhu
(jujubes) the hair of his ears and his eyebrows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:6">12:9:1:6</span></span>6. And
the hairs of wolf are the hair on his abdomen and that below; and the
hairs of tiger are the hair on his chest and that of his armpits; and
the hairs of lion are the hair of his head and his beard.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:7">12:9:1:7</span></span>7.
There are three sacrificial animals, for this body of man consists of
three parts: it is the body he thereby wins (in heaven) for him;--what
is below the navel (he wins) by that of the A*s*vins, what is above the
navel and below the head by that of Sarasvatî, and the head itself by
that of Indra: both as to its (bodily) form and as to its deities he
thus delivers his own self from death, and makes it immortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:8">12:9:1:8</span></span>8.
There are three sacrificial cakes, for this life of man consists of
three parts: it is life he thereby wins for him;--the early life (he
wins) by that of Indra, the middle (part of) life by that of Savit*ri*,
and the last (part of) life by that of Varu*n*a: both as to its (bodily)
form and as to its deities he thus delivers his life from death, and
makes it immortal.

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:9">12:9:1:9</span></span>9.
There are six cups (of milk and liquor), for there are these six
(channels of) vital airs in the head: it is the vital airs he thereby
wins for him;--his eyes (he wins) by the two (cups) of the A*s*vins, his
nostrils by those of Sarasvatî, and his ears by those of Indra: both as
to its (bodily) form and as to its deities he thus delivers his own self
from death, and makes it immortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:10">12:9:1:10</span></span>10.
The invitatory and offering-formulas are made continuous <span
id="fr_663"></span>[1](#fn_659.md), and relate to the same deities--for the
continuity and uninterruptedness of the vital airs. They are all of them
invitatory formulas and all offering-formulas, whence all the vital airs
pass onwards and all of them backwards. All (the formulas) are first,
all of them intermediate, and all of them last, whence all the vital
airs are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last. All the
cups have two (formulas, an) invitatory and (an) offering-formula,--this
is of the form of the in (and out)-breathing and the up-breathing: it is
the in-breathing and the up-breathing he thus secures for himself, and
therefore all the vital airs are established on the in-breathing and the
up-breathing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:11">12:9:1:11</span></span>11.
Verily the Sautrâma*n*î is this body (of man): the Sacrificer is the
mind, (that is) speech manifestly; the vedi (altar-ground) is the trunk,
the uttara-vedi (high-altar) offspring, the barhis (grass-covering)
cattle, the officiating priests the limbs, the fuel the hones, the ghee
the marrow, the fire the mouth, the oblation is food, and the concluding
rite is life, whence he who has performed the Sautrâma*n*î attains life.

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:12">12:9:1:12</span></span>12.
And, verily, these two men that seem to be in the eyes, they belong to
the A*s*vins, and the black (in the eye) belongs to Sarasvatî, and the
white to Indra; and in that, when the victim of the A*s*vins is being
(offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts
those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:13">12:9:1:13</span></span>13.
Indra, assuredly, is the mind, Sarasvatî speech, and the two A*s*vins
are the ears. Now, whatever one thinks in his mind of that he speaks
with his speech, and what he speaks with his speech that one hears with
one's ears: thus, in that, when the victim of Sarasvatî is being
(offered), he makes offering to these deities together, thereby he puts
these (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:14">12:9:1:14</span></span>14.
Indra, assuredly, is the breath, Sarasvatî the tongue, and the two
A*s*vins the nostrils; and inasmuch as through (the channel of) the
breath (prâ*n*a) one introduces (prâ-*n*î) food into himself that is the
reason of its being (called) 'prâ*n*a.' By means of the tongue one
distinguishes the essence (taste) of food, and the nostrils, indeed, are
the path of the breath; and in that, when the victim of Indra. is being
(offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts
those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:15">12:9:1:15</span></span>15.
Indra, assuredly, is the heart, Savit*ri* the liver, and Varu*n*a the
lung; and in that, when Indra's cake is being (offered), he makes
offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of the
body) together and takes them to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:16">12:9:1:16</span></span>16.
Savit*ri*, assuredly, is the breath, Varu*n*a the

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

through-breathing, and Indra the generative organ; and whatever food one
eats by means of (the channel of) the breath through that he breathes
with his through-breathing, and by means of the generative organ he
sheds the essence of food as seed; and in that, when Savit*ri*'s cake is
being (offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby
he puts those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:1:17">12:9:1:17</span></span>17.
Varu*n*a, assuredly, is the womb, Indra the seed, and Savit*ri* the
generator of the seed; and in that, when Varu*n*a's cake is being
(offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts
those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself. And
whosoever thus knows this comes into being along with these deities, and
is born again (so as to be) along with these deities; he increases in
offspring and cattle; he becomes firmly established in this world, and
wins the heavenly world, whosoever, knowing this, performs the
Sautrâma*n*î, or whosoever thus knows this.

Purusha, Agni-Pra*g*âpati; and the Sacrificer.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[260:1](sbe44071.htm#fr_659.md) That is, because
to a man of another caste the spirituous liquor would not be 'anâdyâ,'
but consumable, and hence it would consume him in the other world.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[260:2](sbe44071.htm#fr_661.md) The two terms
'ântrâ*n*i' and gudâ*h*' are usually taken as synonymous; the latter
term probably means the lower or larger intestines; cf. Vâ*g*. S. XIX,
86.
