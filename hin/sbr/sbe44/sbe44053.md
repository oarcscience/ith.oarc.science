### THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:1:1">12:3:1:1</span></span>1.
'Seeing that all this threefold universe keeps passing into one another,
O Bâlâki, how is it that

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

these,--to wit, the sacrifice, Man, and Pra*g*âpati,--do not exceed one
another?

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:1:2">12:3:1:2</span></span>2.
Seeing that the upward Stomas follow the sacrifice, fitting themselves
by repetitions with Sâmans, how do they enter man, and how do they
become united with the vital airs?

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:1:3">12:3:1:3</span></span>3. The
Prâya*n*îya Atirâtra, the *K*aturvi*ms*a day, the four Abhiplavas, and
the P*ri*sh*th*ya (sha*d*aha):how do these enter man, and how do they
become united with the vital airs?

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:1:4">12:3:1:4</span></span>4.
Fitted out with the Abhi*g*it, the Svarasâmans join the Vishuvat on both
sides:--how do these enter man, and how do they become united with the
vital airs?

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:1:5">12:3:1:5</span></span>5.
Setting out with the Triv*ri*t, fitted out with the (Pa*ñk*ada*s*a and)
Saptada*s*a, and ending with the Trayastri*ms*a; with (the series of
stomas increasing) successively by four (syllables <span
id="fr_486"></span>[1](#fn_486)):--how do these enter man, and how do
they become united with the vital airs?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:1:6">12:3:1:6</span></span>6. The
Triv*ri*t is his head, the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a his neck; and the chest, they
say, corresponds to the Saptada*s*a; the Ekavi*ms*a they make the belly,
and

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

the two sides, by means of the Tri*n*ava, correspond to the ribs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:1:7">12:3:1:7</span></span>7. The
Abhiplavas on both sides (of the Vishuvat) are his arms, the
P*ri*sh*th*ya is the back,--so say the wise; and his spine the
Brâhma*n*as fashion in the year by means of the (series of stomas
increasing) successively by four (syllables).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:1:8">12:3:1:8</span></span>8. The
Abhi*g*it and Vi*s*va*g*it are his ears; and his eyes, they say,
correspond to the Svarasâmans; the Vishuvat, they say, is the breath of
the nostrils; and the Go and Âyus are those two downward breathings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:1:9">12:3:1:9</span></span>9. The
Da*s*arâtra they call his limbs, and the Mahâvrata the Brâhma*n*as
fashion (arrange) so as to be the mouth in the year <span
id="fr_487"></span>[1](#fn_487);--the Supreme Self has entered into that
year endowed with all stomas and with all sâmans: having fashioned him
alike with the body, the sage is seated free from pain <span
id="fr_488"></span>[2](#fn_488) on the heights of the ruddy one (the
sun).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_486"></span>[166:1](sbe44053.htm#fr_486) The Triv*ri*t, or
nine-versed stoma, is, however, followed by the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a, or
fifteen-versed stoma--the thirteen-versed form not being in ordinary
use--and these are succeeded by the Saptada*s*a (17), Ekavi*ms*a (21),
&c. Possibly, however, this last sentence may refer to the six days of
the P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha for which the stomas consisting of 9, 25,
17, 21, 27 and 33 verses respectively are used. On the Abhi*g*it day,
each of the first four stomas is used in succession for three stotras,
the four hymn-forms thus making up the twelve stotras of the
Agnish*t*oma. On the Vi*s*va*g*it day, on the other hand, only three
stomas are used--the Triv*ri*t, Pa*ñk*ada*s*a, and Saptada*s*a--four
stotras being assigned to each of these three hymn-forms.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[167:1](sbe44053.htm#fr_487) Though the
Mahâvrata day is actually the last day but one of the one year's
sacrificial session, whilst the *K*aturvi*ms*a day is the second, these
two days mark really the end and beginning of the year, whilst the
nominal first and last days of the sessional performance may be
considered as consisting of mere preliminary and concluding (winding-up)
rites. The above symbolic identification of the Mahâvrata with the mouth
of Agni-Pra*g*âpati, the Year, might thus lead one to suppose (as,
indeed, is done by Prof. Hillebrandt, Die Sonnwendfeste in Alt-Indien,
p. 11) that if two such annual sessions were immediately to succeed each
other, the Mahâvrata and Katurvim*s*a would fall on one and the same
day. The Mahâvrata, representing (at least symbolically) the
winter-solstice, would thus mark both the end and the beginning of two
successive solar periods.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[167:2](sbe44053.htm#fr_488) Literally, with
unborn pain (or, with the pain of one unborn).
