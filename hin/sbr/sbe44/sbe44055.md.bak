### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:1">12:3:3:1</span></span>1. The
gods were once performing the initiation ceremony for a (sacrificial
session) of a thousand years. When five hundred years had passed with
them, everything here was worn out--to wit, Stomas, and P*ri*sh*th*as,
and metres (texts).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:2">12:3:3:2</span></span>2. The
gods then perceived that unexhausted element of the sacrifice, and by
means of that unexhausted element they obtained what success there was
in the Veda; and, verily, for him who thus knows this, the Vedas are
unexhausted, and the work of the officiating priests is pet-formed with
the unexhausted threefold science.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:3">12:3:3:3</span></span>3. Now,
this is that unexhausted element of the sacrifice:--o-*s*râvaya, astu
*s*rausha*t*, ya*g*a, ye ya*g*âmahe, and vausha*t* <span
id="fr_493"></span>[2](#fn_493.md). In these five utterances there are
seventeen syllables:--o-*s*râvaya consists of four syllables, astu
*s*rausha*t* of four syllables, ya*g*a of two syllables, ye ya*g*âmahe
of five syllables;

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:4">12:3:3:4</span></span>4. And
the Vasha*t*-call consists of two syllables. This is the seventeenfold
Pra*g*âpati, as established in the deity and in the body, and, verily,
whosoever thus knows that seventeenfold Pra*g*âpati, as established in
the deity and in the body, establishes himself by offspring and cattle
in this, and by immortality in the other, world.

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:5">12:3:3:5</span></span>5. The
gods then spake, 'Find ye out that sacrificial performance which shall
be a substitute for one of a thousand years; for what man is equal
thereto that he could get through with (a performance of) a thousand
years?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:6">12:3:3:6</span></span>6. They
saw the Vi*s*va*g*it with all the P*ri*sh*th*as <span
id="fr_494"></span>[1](#fn_494.md) to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lien
of the P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha, for there are those (same) Stomas, those
P*ri*sh*th*as, and those metres.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:7">12:3:3:7</span></span>7. They
saw the P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lieu
of the Dvâda*s*âha, for there are those (same) Stomas, those
P*ri*sh*th*as, and those metres <span id="fr_495"></span>[2](#fn_495.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:8">12:3:3:8</span></span>8. They
saw the Dvâda*s*âha to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lieu of (a
session of) a year <span id="fr_496"></span>[3](#fn_496.md), for there are
those (same) Stomas, those P*ri*sh*th*as, and those metres.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:9">12:3:3:9</span></span>9. They
saw the (session of a) year to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lieu of
the Tâpa*sk*ita <span id="fr_497"></span>[4](#fn_497.md), for there are
those (same) Stomas, those P*ri*sh*th*as, and those metres.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:10">12:3:3:10</span></span>10.
They saw the Tâpa*sk*ita to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lieu of the
thousand years’ performance, for there are those (same) Stomas, those
P*ri*sh*th*as, and those metres.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:11">12:3:3:11</span></span>11.
He passes a year with the rites of initiation,

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

a year with the Upasads, and a year with the pressings of Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:12">12:3:3:12</span></span>12.
When he passes a year with the rites of initiation he thereby secures
for himself the first part of the performance of a thousand years; and
when he passes a year with the Upasads he thereby secures for himself
the central part of the performance of a thousand years; and when he
passes a year with the pressings he thereby secures for himself the last
part of the performance of a thousand years.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:13">12:3:3:13</span></span>13.
Twelve months he passes with the rites of initiation, twelve with the
Upasads, and twelve with the pressings,--that makes thirty-six. Now the
B*ri*hatî (metre) consists of thirty-six syllables, and by means of the
B*ri*hatî the gods strove to reach heaven, and by means of the B*ri*hatî
they indeed attained heaven; and in like manner does this one, by means
of the B*ri*hatî, now strive to reach heaven, and by means of the
B*ri*hatî he indeed attains heaven; and whatever object of desire there
is in the B*ri*hatî, that he thereby secures for himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:3:14">12:3:3:14</span></span>14.
But, indeed, there is that triad that is performed together,--the Agni
(fire-altar), the Arkya, and the Mahad Uktham (great litany). When he
passes a year with the rites of initiation, and a year with the Upasads,
thereby the Agni and the Arka are secured by him; and when he passes a
year with the pressings, thereby the Mahad Uktham is secured by him:
this, then, to wit, the Tâpa*sk*ita, is the substitute for the
performance of a thousand years, and this, to wit, the Tâpa*sk*ita,
conduces to the procreation of creatures.
