### NINTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:9:1">13:2:9:1</span></span>1. But,
indeed, that glory, royal power, passes away from him who performs the
A*s*vamedha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:9:2">13:2:9:2</span></span>2.
\[The Udgât*ri* <span id="fr_831"></span>[1](#fn_827) says concerning
the king's favourite wife, Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 26,\] 'Raise her
upwards <span id="fr_832"></span>[2](#fn_828),'--the A*s*vamedha,
doubtless, is that glory, royal power: that glory, royal power, he thus
raises for him (the Sacrificer) upward.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:9:3">13:2:9:3</span></span>3.
'Even as one taking a burden up a mountain,'--glory (pomp), doubtless,
is the burden of royal power: that glory, royal power, he thus fastens
on him (as a burden); but he also endows him with that glory, royal
power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:9:4">13:2:9:4</span></span>4. 'And
may the centre of her body prosper,'--the centre of royal power,
doubtless, is glory: glory (prosperity), food, he thus lays into the
very centre of royal power (or, the kingdom).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:9:5">13:2:9:5</span></span>5. 'As
one winnowing in the cool breeze,'--the cool of royal power, doubtless,
is security of

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

possession: security of possession he procures for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:9:6">13:2:9:6</span></span>6.
\[The Adhvaryu addresses one of the attendant maids, Vâ*g*. S. XXIII,
22,\] 'That little bird,'--the little bird, doubtless, is the people (or
clan),--'which bustles with (the sound) "ahalak,"'--for the people,
indeed, bustle for (the behoof of) royal power,--'thrusts the "pasas"
into the cleft, and the "dhârakâ" devours it,'--the cleft, doubtless, is
the people, and the 'pasas' is royal power; and royal power, indeed,
presses hard on the people; whence the wielder of royal power is apt to
strike down people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:9:7">13:2:9:7</span></span>7.
\[The Brahman addresses the queen consort, Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 24,\] 'Thy
mother and father,'--the mother, doubtless, is this (earth), and the
father yonder (sky): by means of these two he causes him to go to
heaven;--'mount to the top of the tree,'--the top of royal power,
doubtless, is glory: the top of royal power, glory, he thus causes him
to attain;--'saying, "I pass along," thy father passed his fist to and
fro in the cleft,'--the cleft, doubtless, is the people; and the fist is
royal power; and royal power, indeed, presses hard on the people; whence
he who wields royal power is apt to strike down people <span
id="fr_833"></span>[1](#fn_829).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:9:8">13:2:9:8</span></span>8.
\[The chamberlain addresses the king's fourth wife, Vâ*g*. S. XXIII,
30,\] 'When the deer eats the corn,'--the grain (growing in the field),
doubtless, is the people, and the deer is royal power: he

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

thus makes the people to be food for the royal power, whence the wielder
of royal power feeds on the people;--'it thinks not of the fat
cattle,'--whence the king does not rear cattle;--'when the *S*ûdra woman
is the Arya's mistress, he seeks not riches that he may thrive <span
id="fr_834"></span>[1](#fn_830),'--hence he does not anoint the son of a
Vai*s*ya woman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:9:9">13:2:9:9</span></span>9. But,
indeed, the vital airs pass from those who speak impure speech at the
sacrifice. \[The queen consort having been made to rise by her
attendants, the priests and chamberlain say, Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 32,
*Ri*g-v. S. IV, 39, 6,\] 'The praises of Dadhikrâvan have I sung, (the
victorious, powerful horse: may he make fragrant our mouths, and prolong
our lives!),'--thus they finally utter a verse containing the word
'fragrant': it is (their own) speech they purify <span
id="fr_835"></span>[2](#fn_831), and the vital airs do not pass from
them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_827"></span>[324:1](sbe44091.htm#fr_831) The colloquy
between the men and women, referred to in [paragraphs
1](sbe44091.htm#13:2:9:1)-[8](sbe44091.htm#13:2:9:8), would seem to go
on simultaneously. The verse addressed by the Hot*ri* to the king's
discarded wife, Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 28, is omitted by the Brâhma*n*a, as
are also the verses spoken in reply by the women (with their
attendants), and closely resembling those of the men in tone and
wording. According to some authorities it is the attendant women alone
who reply, not the king's wives. Katy. XX, 6, 20.

<span id="fn_828"></span>[324:2](sbe44091.htm#fr_832) Mahîdhara takes
the objective pronoun to refer to the Vâvâtâ, whilst Harisvâmin, on the
other hand, supplies some such word as '*s*â*t*ika*m*.'

<span id="fn_829"></span>[325:1](sbe44091.htm#fr_833) The Mahishî: Thy
mother and father are playing on the top of the tree like thy mouth when
thou wilt talk: do not talk so much, Brahman!

<span id="fn_830"></span>[326:1](sbe44091.htm#fr_834) Mahîdhara
interprets,--then he (her husband), the *S*ûdra, does not wish for
wealth, but is unhappy.

<span id="fn_831"></span>[326:2](sbe44091.htm#fr_835) That is to say,
they make amends for any breaches of decorum committed in the preceding
colloquy.
