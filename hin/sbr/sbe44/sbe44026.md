### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE SEASONAL SACRIFICES (*K*âturmâsya).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:2:1">11:5:2:1</span></span>1. By
means of the Seasonal sacrifices, Pra*g*âpati fashioned for himself a
body. The sacrificial food for the Vai*s*vadeva <span
id="fr_250"></span>[2](#fn_250) sacrifice he made to be this

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

right arm of his; the oblation to Agni thereof this thumb; that to Soma
this (fore-finger); and that to Savit*ri* this (middle finger).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:2:2">11:5:2:2</span></span>2. That
cake (to Savit*ri*), doubtless, is the largest, and hence this (middle
finger) is the largest of these (fingers). That (oblation) to Sarasvatî
is this (third) finger; and that to Pûshan this (little finger). And
that (oblation) to the Maruts is this joint above the hand (the wrist);
and that to the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* is this (elbow <span
id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_251)); and that to Heaven and Earth is this
arm: this (oblation) is indistinct <span
id="fr_252"></span>[2](#fn_252), whence that limb also is
indistinct <span id="fr_253"></span>[3](#fn_253).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:2:3">11:5:2:3</span></span>3. The
Varu*n*apraghâsa <span id="fr_254"></span>[4](#fn_254) offerings are
this right leg,--the five oblations which this has in common (with the
other Seasonal offerings) are these five toes; and the oblation to Indra
and Agni is the knuckles: this (oblation) belongs to two deities

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

whence there are these two knuckles. That (oblation) to Varu*n*a is this
(shank); that to the Maruts this (thigh); and that (cake) to Ka is this
back-bone: this (oblation) is indistinct, whence that (back-bone) is
indistinct.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:2:4">11:5:2:4</span></span>4. The
offering to (Agni) Anîkavat (of the Sâkamedhâ*h* <span
id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_255)), doubtless, is his (Pra*g*âpati's)
mouth, for the mouth is the extreme end (anîka) of the vital airs; the
Sâ*m*tapanîyâ (pap) is the chest, for by the chest one is, as it were,
confined <span id="fr_256"></span>[2](#fn_256) (sa*m*-tap); the
G*ri*hamedhîyâ (pap) is the belly--to serve as a foundation, for the
belly is a foundation; the Krai*d*ina oblation is the male organ, for it
is therewith that (man) sports (krî*d*), as it were; and the offering to
Aditi <span id="fr_257"></span>[3](#fn_257) is this downward breathing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:2:5">11:5:2:5</span></span>5. The
Great Oblation, indeed, is this left leg,--the five oblations which it
has in common (with the other Seasonal offerings) are these five toes;
and the oblation to Indra and Agni is the knuckles: this (oblation)
belongs to two deities whence there are

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

these two knuckles. The (oblation) to Mahendra is this (shank); that to
Vi*s*vakarman this (thigh): this (oblation) is indistinct, whence this
(thigh) also is indistinct.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:2:6">11:5:2:6</span></span>6. The
*S*unâsîrîya <span id="fr_258"></span>[1](#fn_258), doubtless, is this
left arm,--the five oblations which it has in common (with the other
Seasonal offerings) are these five fingers; the *S*unâsîrîya is that
joint of his above the hand; that (oblation) to Vâyu is this (elbow);
that to Sûrya this arm: this (oblation) is indistinct, whence this
(limb) also is indistinct.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:2:7">11:5:2:7</span></span>7. Now
these Seasonal offerings are tripartite and furnished with two
joints <span id="fr_259"></span>[2](#fn_259), whence these limbs of man
are tripartite and furnished with two joints. Two of these four
(sacrifices) have each three indistinct (low-voiced) oblations; and two
of them have two each <span id="fr_260"></span>[3](#fn_260).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:2:8">11:5:2:8</span></span>8. At
all four of them they churn out the fire,

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

whence (the draught animal) pulls with all four limbs. At two of them
they lead (the fire) forward <span id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_261),
whence it (the animal) walks on two (feet at a time) <span
id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_262). Thus, then, Pra*g*âpati fashioned for
himself a body by means of the Seasonal sacrifices; and in like manner
does the Sacrificer who knows this fashion for himself a (divine) body
by means of the Seasonal sacrifices.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:2:9">11:5:2:9</span></span>9. As
to this they say, 'The Vai*s*vadeva oblation (should have) all (its
formulas) in the Gâyatrî, the Varu*n*apraghâsâ*h* all in the
Trish*t*ubh, the Great Oblation all in the *G*agatî, and the
*S*unâsîrîya all in the Anush*t*ubh metre, so as to yield a
Katush*t*oma <span id="fr_263"></span>[3](#fn_263).' But let him not do
this, for inasmuch as (his formulas) amount to these (metres) even
thereby that wish is obtained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:2:10">11:5:2:10</span></span>10.
Now, indeed, (the formulas of) these Seasonal offerings. amount to three
hundred and sixty-two B*ri*hatî verses <span
id="fr_264"></span>[4](#fn_264): he thereby obtains both the year <span
id="fr_265"></span>[5](#fn_265)

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

and the Mahâvrata <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_266); and thus,
indeed, this Sacrificer also has a twofold <span
id="fr_267"></span>[2](#fn_267) foundation, and he thus makes the
Sacrificer reach the heavenly world, and establishes him therein.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_250"></span>[74:2](sbe44026.htm#fr_250) The Vai*s*vadeva,
or first of the four seasonal sacrifices, requires the following
oblations:--1. a cake on eight potsherds to Agni; 2. a pap to Soma; 3. a
cake on twelve or eight potsherds to <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>
Savit*ri*; 4. a pap to Sarasvatî; 5. a pap to Pûshan--these first five
oblations recur at all seasonal offerings;--6. a cake on seven potsherds
to the Maruts; 7. a dish of clotted curds to the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*; 8. a
cake on one potsherd to Heaven and Earth.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[75:1](sbe44026.htm#fr_251) It would rather
seem that what is intended here by 'sa*m*dhi' is not the joints
themselves, but the limbs (in the anatomical sense) between the
articulations. Similarly in 'trishandhi' in [parag.
7](sbe44026.htm#11:5:2:7).

<span id="fn_252"></span>[75:2](sbe44026.htm#fr_252) That is to say, it
is a low-voiced offering, the two formulas, with the exception of the
final Om and Vausha*t*, being pronounced in a low voice. All cakes on
one potsherd are (except those to Varu*n*a) of this description; Kâty.
*S*r. IV, 5, 3; Â*s*v. *S*r. II, 15, 5; cf. *S*at. Br. II, 4, 3, 8.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[75:3](sbe44026.htm#fr_253) That is, not
clearly defined; the word 'dos,' which is more usually restricted to the
fore-arm, being also used for the whole arm, and even the upper arm.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[75:4](sbe44026.htm#fr_254) The
Varu*n*apraghâsâ*h*, or second seasonal sacrifice, has the following
oblations:--1-5. the common oblations; 6. a cake on twelve potsherds to
Indra and Agni; 7. 8. two dishes of clotted curds for Varu*n*a and the
Maruts respectively; 9. a cake on one potsherd for Ka (Pra*g*âpati).

<span id="fn_255"></span>[76:1](sbe44026.htm#fr_255) The Sâkamedhâ*h*,
or third seasonal sacrifice, consists of the following oblations:--1. a
cake on eight potsherds to Agni Anîkavat; 2. 3. paps to the Maruta*h*
Sâ*m*tapanâ*h* and Maruta*h* G*ri*hamedhina*h*; 4. a cake on seven
potsherds to the Maruta*h* Krî*d*ina*h*; 5. a pap to Aditi. Then follows
the Great Oblation consisting of 6-10, the five common oblations; 11. a
cake on twelve potsherds to Indra and Agni; 12. a pap to Mahendra; and
13. a cake on one potsherd to Vi*s*vakarman. Then follows the
Pit*ri*ya*gñ*a.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[76:2](sbe44026.htm#fr_256) Or, according to
Sâya*n*a, one gets oppressed or heated on account of the close proximity
of the heart and the digestive fire,--urasâ h*ri*daya-sambandhâ*g*
*g*a*th*arasannive*s*â*k* *k*a sa*m*tâpana-vishayatvam.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[76:3](sbe44026.htm#fr_257) This offering of a
cake to Aditi, mentioned in Kâty. Sr. V, 7, 2, is not referred to in the
Brâhma*n*a's account of the Sâkamedhâ*h*, see II, 5, 3, 20.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[77:1](sbe44026.htm#fr_258) The Sunâsîrîya, or
last Seasonal offering, consists of--1-5. the common oblations; 6. the
*S*unâsîrîya cake on twelve potsherds; 7. a milk oblation to Vâyu; 8. a
cake on one potsherd to Sûrya.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[77:2](sbe44026.htm#fr_259) The Seasonal
offerings are performed so as to leave an interval of four months
between them; the fourth falling exactly a year after the first; hence
the whole performance consists, as it were, of three periods of four
months each, with two joints between them;--corresponding to the
formation of the arms and legs.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[77:3](sbe44026.htm#fr_260) Of the five
oblations common to the four sacrifices, one--viz. the cake to
Savit*ri*--is a low-voiced offering (Kâty. Sr. IV, 5, 5; Â*s*v. *S*r.
II, 15, 7), as are also the one-kapâla cakes of which there is one in
each sacrifice. According to Sâya*n*a the first and last Seasonal
sacrifices have only these two Upâm*s*uyâ*g*as, whilst the second and
third have each one additional low-voiced oblation, but he does not
specify them. This is, however, a mistake, as Kâtyâyana, *S*r. IV, 5, 6.
7, states distinctly, that the two additional low-voiced oblations are
the Vai*s*vadevî payasyâ in the first, and the oblation to Vâyu in the
last, *K*âturmâsya.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[78:1](sbe44026.htm#fr_261) According to
Sâya*n*a this refers to the first and last Seasonal sacrifices, inasmuch
as there is no uttaravedi required for these, and hence only the simple
leading forward of the fire to the Âhavanîya hearth; whilst the
commentary on Katy. V, 4, 6, on the contrary, refers it just to the
other two, because a double leading forth takes place there.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[78:2](sbe44026.htm#fr_262) Or, as Sâya*n*a
takes it, man walks on two feet.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[78:3](sbe44026.htm#fr_263) The *K*atush*t*oma,
properly speaking, is the technical term for such an arrangement of the
Stotras of a Soma-sacrifice by which they are chanted on stomas, or
hymn-forms, increasing successively by four verses. Two such
arrangements (of four and six different stomas respectively) are
mentioned, one for an Agnish*t*oma sacrifice, and the other for a
Sho*d*a*s*in. See note on [XIII, 3, 1, 4](sbe44094.htm#13:3:1:4).

<span id="fn_264"></span>[78:4](sbe44026.htm#fr_264) These 362 B*ri*hatî
verses (of 36 syllables each) would amount to 13,032 syllables; and,
verses of the four metres referred to amounting together to 148
syllables, this amount is contained in the former 88 times, leaving only
eight over; so slight a discrepancy being considered of no account in
such calculations.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[78:5](sbe44026.htm#fr_265) That is, a year of
360 days; and if, as is done by Sâya*n*a (in <span id="page_79">p.
79</span> accordance with the calculations in Book X), the year is
identified with the fire-altar, a mahâvedi containing 360 Ya*g*ushmatî
bricks.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[79:1](sbe44026.htm#fr_266) Sâya*n*a reminds us
that the Mahâvrata-sâman consists of five parts in five different stomas
(Triv*ri*t, &c., see part iv, p. 282, note 4), the verses of which,
added up (9, 15, 17, 25, 21), make 87, which amount is apparently, in a
rough way, to be taken as identical with that of 88 obtained in note
[4](#fn_264) of last page.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[79:2](sbe44026.htm#fr_267) Viz. inasmuch as
the total amount of B*ri*hatîs (362) exceeds by two the number of days
in the year.
