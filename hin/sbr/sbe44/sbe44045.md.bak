# TWELFTH KÂ*ND*A.

#### THE SACRIFICIAL SESSION (SATTRA).

### FIRST ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:1:1">12:1:1:1</span></span>1.
Verily, this sacrifice is the same as this blowing (wind): it is
that <span id="fr_415"></span>[1](#fn_415.md) they wish to secure who take
the vow of initiation for a year. Of them the G*ri*hapati is initiated
first <span id="fr_416"></span>[2](#fn_416.md); for the G*ri*hapati is this
(terrestrial) world, and upon this world everything here is established;
and so, indeed, are his fellow-sacrificers established in the
G*ri*hapati: it is thus after they have become established on a firm
foundation that they are initiated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:1:2">12:1:1:2</span></span>2. He
(the Adhvaryu) then initiates the Brahman (priest). Now the Brahman is
the moon, and the moon is Soma, and plants belong to Soma <span
id="fr_417"></span>[3](#fn_417.md): he thus connects the plants with this
(terrestrial) world. Therefore no other person should be initiated
between those two; for, assuredly, were any one else to be initiated
between those two, he would separate (tear up) the plants from this
(terrestrial) world, and they would be liable to dry up: let therefore
no other person be initiated between those two.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:1:3">12:1:1:3</span></span>3. He
then initiates the Udgât*ri*. Now, the Udgât*ri* is the thunder-cloud,
and from the thundercloud rain is produced: he thus connects the rain

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

with the plants. Therefore no other person should be initiated between
those two; for, assuredly, were any one else to be initiated between
those two, he would separate the rain from the plants, and (the cloud)
would be liable to lack rain: let therefore no other person be initiated
between those two.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:1:4">12:1:1:4</span></span>4. He
then initiates the Ho tri. Now, the Hot*ri* <span
id="fr_418"></span>[1](#fn_418.md) is Agni in respect of the deity, and
speech in respect of the body; and rain is food: he thus connects both
Agni (fire) and speech with food. Therefore no other person should be
initiated between those two; for, assuredly, were any one else to be
initiated between those two, he would separate fire and speech from
food, and (people) would be liable to starve: let therefore no other
person be initiated between those two.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:1:5">12:1:1:5</span></span>5. The
Pratiprasthât*ri* then initiates the Adhvaryu. Now, the Adhvaryu is the
mind <span id="fr_419"></span>[2](#fn_419.md), and the Hot*ri* is speech:
he thus connects mind and speech with one another. Therefore no other
person should be initiated between those two; for, assuredly, were any
one else to be initiated between those two, he would separate mind and
speech, and (people) would be liable to perish: let therefore no other
person be initiated between those two.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:1:6">12:1:1:6</span></span>6. He
then initiates the Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin for the Brahman, for under him
the former is. He then initiates the Prastot*ri* for the Udgât*ri*, for
under

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

him the former is. He then initiates the Maitrâvaru*n*a for the Hot*ri*,
for under him the former is. These four the Pratiprasthât*ri* initiates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:1:7">12:1:1:7</span></span>7. The
Nesh*tri* then initiates the Pratiprasthât*ri* for the Adhvaryu, for
under him the former is. It is after the fitting out <span
id="fr_420"></span>[1](#fn_420.md) of these nine that the others are fitted
out; for there are nine vital airs: he thus lays the vital airs into
them; and so they attain the full term of life, and so they do not
depart this world before their (full) term of life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:1:8">12:1:1:8</span></span>8. He
then initiates the Pot*ri* for the Brahman, for under him the former is.
He then initiates the Pratihart*ri* for the Udgât*ri*, for under him the
former is. He then initiates the A*kh*âvâka for the Hot*ri*, for under
him the former is. These four the Nesh*tri* initiates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:1:9">12:1:1:9</span></span>9. The
Unnet*ri* then initiates the Nesh*tri* for the Adhvaryu, for under him
the former is. He then initiates the Âgnîdhra for the Brahman, for under
him the former is. He then initiates the Subrahma*n*yâ for the
Udgât*ri*, for under him the former is. He then initiates the Grâvastut
for the Hot*ri*, for under him the former is. These four the Unnet*ri*
initiates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:1:10">12:1:1:10</span></span>10.
Either a Snâtaka <span id="fr_421"></span>[2](#fn_421.md), or a
Brahma*k*ârin, or some one else who is not initiated, then initiates the
Unnet*ri*; for they say, 'No pure one should purify.' This is the
regular order of initiation <span id="fr_422"></span>[3](#fn_422.md);

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

and; assuredly, only when, knowing this <span
id="fr_423"></span>[1](#fn_423.md), they become initiated, they make ready
the sacrifice even whilst being initiated, and along with the getting
ready of the sacrifice security of property accrues to the performers of
the sacrificial session (Sattra); and, along with the accruing of
security of property to the performers of the session, security of
property also accrues to that district in which they perform the
sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:1:11">12:1:1:11</span></span>11.
Now, the Unnet*ri* is initiated last of these, and when they come out
from the purificatory bath it is he that comes out first; for the
Unnet*ri* is the vital air: he thus lays vital air into them on both
sides; and so they attain the full term of life, and so they do not
depart this world before their (full) term of life. This is the regular
order of initiation: and, assuredly, he should become initiated only
where such as know this become initiated.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[136:1](sbe44045.htm#fr_418.md) Viz. as the

the head of the sacrifice (IV, 1, 5, 16); and, as the mind, he marches
in front. See also III, 2, 4, 11. 'Mind goes before Speech (prompting
