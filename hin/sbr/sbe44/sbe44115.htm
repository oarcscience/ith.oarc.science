He then sows (seed) of all (kinds of) herbs: what the all-herb (seed signified) on that occasion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1155"></A><A HREF="#fn_1147"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, that (it does) here.

He then pours out that (jarful of bones&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1158"></A><A HREF="#fn_1150"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>); for this earth is the foundation: on this (earth), as a foundation, he thus establishes him. Before sunrise (he does so), for, in secret, as it were, are the Fathers, and in secret, as it were, is the night;--in secret, indeed, he does this, (but) so that (the sun) should rise over him doing it: on both day and night he thus establishes him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:3:3">13:8:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. [He does so, with V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXV, 5-6,] 'May Savit<I>ri</I> deposit thy bones in the mother's lap,'--Savit<I>ri</I> thus deposits his bones in the lap of the mother, this earth;--'O Earth, be thou propitious unto him!' he thus says this in order that this (earth) may be propitious to him.--'In the deity Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati I place thee, in the world nigh unto the water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1159"></A><A HREF="#fn_1151"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, O N.N.,' therewith he mentions the name (of the deceased); for nigh to</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_434"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 434</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the water, indeed, is this (terrestrial) world: he thus places him in the deity Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, in the world nigh unto the water.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:3:4">13:8:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. He then says to some one, 'Proceed in that (southern) direction without drawing breath, and, having thrown down the jar, return hither without looking behind thee!' He then mutters (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXV, 7), 'O Death, go away another way, what second way there is of thine other than the path of the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1160"></A><A HREF="#fn_1152"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; I call unto thee that hast eyes and hearest: hurt not our family nor our men!' for long life he thereby prays for these, and accordingly each subsequent one of them dies of old age.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:3:5">13:8:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. He then arranges him (the dead man) limb by limb, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXV, 8-9), 'Propitious be the wind unto thee, propitious the heat of the sun; propitious be the bricks; propitious be the fires unto thee, and may the earthly ones not scorch thee!--May the regions fit themselves to thee, and may the waters be most kind unto thee, and the rivers; and kind. also the air: may all the regions fit themselves to thee!'--he thereby makes everything fit itself to him, and be auspicious for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:3:6">13:8:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. Now thirteen unmarked&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1161"></A><A HREF="#fn_1153"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> bricks, measuring a foot (square), have been made: they are just like those bricks in the fire-altar. Those (altar bricks) he lays down with a formula, silently these: he thus keeps the divine separate from what belongs to the Fathers.</p>  
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:3:7">13:8:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. There are thirteen of them,--thirteen months are a year: on the seasons, on the year, he thus establishes him, as on a firm foundation.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:3:8">13:8:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. They measure a foot (square),--the foot is a foundation: a foundation he thus prepares for him. Unmarked they are, for in secret, as it were, are the Fathers; and in secret, as it were, is what is unmarked: he thus secretes what is in secret.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:3:9">13:8:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. One of them he places in the middle, with the front side towards the east: this is the body (trunk);--three in front, fitted to (the position of) the head: that is the head;--three on the right; that is the right wing (side);--three on the left: that is the left wing;--three behind: that is the tail. Thus this his body, furnished with wings and tail, is just like that of Agni (the fire-altar).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:3:10">13:8:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. He then bids them bring some soil from a cleft in the ground, for thus the Fathers&#8217; (share) in this (earth) is not excessive; and he also thereby makes the (dead man's) sin to be restricted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1162"></A><A HREF="#fn_1154"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And some, now, dig in that intermediate (south-eastern) quarter, and fetch it from there; and others, again, do so towards the south-west, and fetch it northwards from there: he may do as he chooses.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:3:11">13:8:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. Let him not make it (the sepulchral mound) too large, lest he make the (deceased's) sin large. For a Kshatriya he may make it as high as a man with upstretched arms, for a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a reaching up to the mouth, for a woman up to the hips, for a Vai<I>s</I>ya up to the thighs, for a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra up to the knee; for suchlike is their vigour.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:3:12">13:8:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. But let him rather make it so as to reach</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_436"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 436</FONT></A></p>  
<p>below the knee: he thus leaves no room for another. While that (mound) is being made, they hold a bundle (of reed grass) to the left (north, uttarata<I>h</I>) of it,--that is offspring: they thus hold the (deceased's) offspring upwards (uttarata<I>h</I>). Do not let him throw it down either after holding it up, or after bringing it; but let him set it up in the house&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1163"></A><A HREF="#fn_1155"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: he thus sets up offspring in the house.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:3:13">13:8:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. Having prepared it, he sows barley grain (yava), thinking, 'May they ward off (yavaya) sin from me!' He covers it over with Avak&acirc;-plants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1164"></A><A HREF="#fn_1156"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in order that there may be joy (or moisture, ka) for him; and with Darbha grass (Poa cynosuroides) he covers it for the sake of softness.</p>
