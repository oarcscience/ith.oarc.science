### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:1">14:2:2:1</span></span>1. And
when the Hot*ri* recites this (verse), 'Let Brahma*n*aspati go forward,
let the goddess Sûn*ri*tâ go forward,'--the Adhvaryu, stepping forward,
makes offering (by muttering) the wind-names. For at this time the gods
were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya)
of theirs in the middle (of the sacrifice): they offered it with the
Svâhâ-call before (its being taken to) the Âhavanîya, being thus offered
they offered it (again) in the fire; and in like manner does this one
now offer it with the Svâhâ-call before

<span id="page_479">p. 479</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (its being taken
to) the Âhavanîya, and being thus offered he offers it (again) in the
fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:2">14:2:2:2</span></span>2.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 7,\] 'To the wind Ocean (I offer) thee, hail!'--the
(aerial) ocean (samudra) indeed is he who blows here, for from out of
that ocean all the gods and all the beings issue forth (samud-dru): it
is to him (Vâyu, the wind) he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To
the wind Ocean (I consecrate) thee, hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:3">14:2:2:3</span></span>3. 'To
the wind Flood--thee, hail!'--the flood (sarira) indeed is he who blows
here, for from out of that flood all the gods and all the creatures come
forth together (saha irate): it is to him he thus offers it, and
therefore he says, 'To the wind Flood--thee, hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:4">14:2:2:4</span></span>4. 'To
the wind Unassailable--thee, hail! To the wind Irresistible--thee,
hail!'--unassailable and irresistible indeed is he who blows here: it is
to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To the wind
Unassailable--thee, hail! To the wind Irresistible--thee, hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:5">14:2:2:5</span></span>5. 'To
the wind Favourable--thee, hail! To the wind Ogress-ridder--thee,
hail!'--favourable and an ogress-ridder indeed is he who blows here: it
is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To the wind
Favourable--thee, hail! To the wind Ogress-ridder--thee, hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:6">14:2:2:6</span></span>6.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 8,\] 'To Indra, accompanied by the Vasus and
Rudras, (I offer) thee, hail!'--Indra indeed is he who blows here: it is
to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To Indra--thee;' and
when he says, 'accompanied by the Vasus and Rudras,' thereby he allows a
share to the Vasus and Rudras along with Indra; and,

<span id="page_480">p. 480</span>

moreover, it is thereby made to be like the morning Soma-pressing, and
the midday-pressing <span id="fr_1271"></span>[1](#fn_1263).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:7">14:2:2:7</span></span>7. 'To
Indra, accompanied by the Âdityas,--thee, hail!'--Indra indeed is he who
blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To
Indra--thee;' and when he says, 'accompanied by the Âdityas,' thereby he
allows a share to the Âdityas along with Indra; and, moreover, it is
made like the evening-pressing <span id="fr_1272"></span>[1](#fn_1263).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:8">14:2:2:8</span></span>8. 'To
Indra, the slayer of the evil-minded,--thee, hail!'--Indra indeed is he
who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says,
'To Indra--thee;' and as to his saying, 'to the slayer of the
evil-minded,' the evil-minded one being an enemy, he thereby means to
say, 'To Indra, the slayer of enemies,--thee!' This is his (Indra's)
special share: even as there is a share for a chief <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[2](#fn_1264), so is this his (share) apart from the
(other) gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:9">14:2:2:9</span></span>9. 'To
Savit*ri*, accompanied by the *Ri*bhus, the Vibhus (lords), and the
Vâ*g*as (powers),--thee, hail!'--Savit*ri* (the sun) indeed is he who
blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To
Savit*ri*, accompanied by the *Ri*bhus, the Vibhus, and the
Vâ*g*as,--thee!' He thus allows a share therein to all the gods along
(with Savit*ri*).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:10">14:2:2:10</span></span>10.
'To B*ri*haspati, accompanied by the All-gods,--thee,
hail!'--B*ri*haspati indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus
offers

<span id="page_481">p. 481</span>

it, and therefore he says, 'To B*ri*haspati--thee;' and when he says,
'accompanied by the All-gods,' he thereby allows a share therein to all
the gods along (with B*ri*haspati).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:11">14:2:2:11</span></span>11.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 9,\] 'To Yama, accompanied by the Aṅgiras and the
Fathers,--thee, hail!'--Yama indeed is he who blows here: it is to him
he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To Yama--thee;' and as to his
saying, 'accompanied by the Aṅgiras and the Fathers,'--when the
sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to
the Fathers,--the Fathers being three in number <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[1](#fn_1265): thus it is to these he thereby allows
a share along (with Yama).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:12">14:2:2:12</span></span>12.
These are twelve names,--twelve months are in a year, and the year is he
that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him
he thereby pleases, and therefore there are twelve (names).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:13">14:2:2:13</span></span>13.
He then pours (the spilt milk and ghee) from the tray into the Mahâvîra
(pot) with, 'Hail to the Gharma!'--the Gharma (hot draught) is he who
shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him he
thereby pleases, and therefore he says, 'Hail to the Gharma!'--the call
of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this
is the same as before <span id="fr_1275"></span>[2](#fn_1266).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:14">14:2:2:14</span></span>14.
When it has been poured in, he mutters, 'Hail, the Gharma to the
Fathers!' When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed

<span id="page_482">p. 482</span>

away, and went to the Fathers--the Fathers being three in number: it is
these he thus pleases. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the
deity last: the significance of this is the same as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:15">14:2:2:15</span></span>15.
He recites no anuvâkyâ (invitatory) formula, for once for all the
Fathers have passed away: therefore he recites no anuvâkyâ. Having
stepped across <span id="fr_1276"></span>[1](#fn_1267), and called (on
the Âgnîdhra) for the Srausha*t* <span
id="fr_1277"></span>[2](#fn_1268), he (the Adhvaryu) says (to the
Hot*ri*), 'Pronounce the offering-formula (yâ*g*yâ) of the Gharma;' and
on the Vasha*t*-call being uttered he offers--

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:16">14:2:2:16</span></span>16.
With (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 10), 'All regions (hath he worshipped), seated
in the south,'--that is to say, 'every region (has he worshipped),
seated on the south;'--'all gods hath he worshipped here,'--that is,
'every god has he worshipped here;'--'of the sweet Gharma, consecrated
by Svâhâ (hail!), drink ye, O A*s*vins!'--with regard to the A*s*vins he
says this; for the A*s*vins restored the head of the sacrifice: it is
them he thus pleases. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity
last: the significance of this is the same as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:17">14:2:2:17</span></span>17.
And, having offered, he (thrice) shakes (the Mahâvîra) upwards, with
(Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 11), 'In heaven place thou this sacrifice! this
sacrifice place thou in heaven!'--for the Gharma (hot milk-draught), the
sacrifice, is yonder sun, and he indeed is 'placed' in the heavens, is

<span id="page_483">p. 483</span>

established in the heavens: it is thus him he thereby pleases, and
therefore he says, 'In heaven place thou this sacrifice! this sacrifice
place thou in heaven!' On the repetition of the Vasha*t*, he offers--

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:18">14:2:2:18</span></span>18.
With, 'Hail to Agni, worthy of sacrifice!'--this is in lieu of the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t (offering), for Agni is the maker of good
offering;--'may blessing result from the sacrificial texts!' for by the
sacrificial texts that (sun) is established (as the Mahâvîra) in this
world: thus it is them he thereby pleases. The call of 'hail!' he places
first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as
before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:19">14:2:2:19</span></span>19.
The Brahman (priest) pronounces the anumantra*n*a (formula of
consecration); for the Brahman is the best physician among the
officiating priests: thus he heals this sacrifice by means of him who is
the best physician among the priests.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:20">14:2:2:20</span></span>20.
\[He does so, with Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 12.\] 'O A*s*vins, drink ye the
Gharma!'--with regard to the A*s*vins he says this, for the A*s*vins
restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:21">14:2:2:21</span></span>21.
'The hearty <span id="fr_1278"></span>[1](#fn_1269) one with daily <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[2](#fn_1270) favours,'--

<span id="page_484">p. 484</span>

this is indistinct, for Pra*g*âpati is indistinct (undefined), and the
sacrifice is Pra*g*âpati: Pra*g*âpati, the sacrifice, he thus heals;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:22">14:2:2:22</span></span>22.
'To the web-weaver,'--the web-weaver, doubtless, is he that shines
yonder, for he moves along these worlds as if along a web; and the
Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him he thereby pleases, and
therefore he says, 'To the web-weaver'--

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:23">14:2:2:23</span></span>23.
'To Heaven and Earth be reverence!' he thus propitiates heaven and
earth, within which everything here is contained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:24">14:2:2:24</span></span>24.
Thereupon the Sacrificer (mutters),--the Sacrificer being the sacrifice,
he thus heals the sacrifice by means of the sacrifice;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:25">14:2:2:25</span></span>25.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 13,\] 'The A*s*vins drank the Gharma,'--he says
this with regard to the A*s*vins, for the A*s*vins restored the head of
the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:26">14:2:2:26</span></span>26.
'Heaven and Earth have approved of it <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[1](#fn_1271)'--he says this with regard to heaven
and earth, within which everything here is contained;--'may gifts accrue
here!'--whereby he means to say, 'may there be riches for us here.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:27">14:2:2:27</span></span>27.
The rising (milk) he then consecrates by the anumantra*n*a <span
id="fr_1281"></span>[2](#fn_1272), 'For freshness swell thou!'

<span id="page_485">p. 485</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --whereby he means
to say, 'For rain . . .;'--'for vigour swell thou!'--he thereby means
the vigour, the life-sap, which results from the rain;--'for the Brahman
swell thou!'---he thereby means the priesthood;--'for the Kshatra swell
thou!'--he thereby means the nobility;--'for Heaven and Earth swell
thou!'--he thereby means these two, the heaven and the earth, within
which everything here is contained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:28">14:2:2:28</span></span>28.
When it rises upwards; it rises for (the benefit of) the Sacrificer;
when on the front side, it does so for the gods; when on the right
(south) side, it does so for the Fathers; when at the back (west side),
it does so for the cattle; when on the left (north) side, it does so for
(the Sacrificer's) offspring: in any case no fault is incurred by the
Sacrificer, for it always rises upwards; and in whatever direction it
rises in that it rises. When the drops cease,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:29">14:2:2:29</span></span>29.
He steps out towards the north-east with, 'A well-supporting support
thou art,'--he who shines yonder is indeed a support, for he supports
everything here, and by him everything here is supported; and the
Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him he thereby, pleases, and
therefore he says, 'A well-supporting support thou art.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:30">14:2:2:30</span></span>30.
He then places (the Mahâvîra) on the mound with, 'Incapable of injuring,
preserve thou our powers!'--'Not angry <span
id="fr_1282"></span>[1](#fn_1273), preserve our wealth,'

<span id="page_486">p. 486</span>

is what he thereby means to say;--'preserve the priesthood, preserve the
nobility, preserve the people!'--'preserve all that,' is what he thereby
means to say.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:31">14:2:2:31</span></span>31.
He then offers by means of the pieces of (split) wood <span
id="fr_1283"></span>[1](#fn_1274),--the pieces of wood being the vital
airs, it is the vital airs he thus bestows upon him;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:32">14:2:2:32</span></span>32.
With (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 15), 'Hail to Pûshan, to the cream!'--Pûshan,
doubtless, is he who blows here, for he (the wind) supports (push)
everything here; and the breath also is that (wind): it is breath he
thus bestows upon him, whence he says, 'Hail to Pûshan, to the cream!'
The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the
significance of this is the same as before. Having offered (by means of
the first piece) he leans it against the middle enclosing-stick <span
id="fr_1284"></span>[2](#fn_1275) (paridhi).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:33">14:2:2:33</span></span>33.
'Hail to the pressing-stones!'--the pressing-stones being the vital
airs, it is the vital airs he thus bestows upon him. Having offered
(with the second stick) he leans it against the middle enclosing-stick.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:34">14:2:2:34</span></span>34.
'Hail to the sounding-holes <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[3](#fn_1276)!'--the

<span id="page_487">p. 487</span>

sounding-holes (pratirava), doubtless, are the vital airs, for
everything here is pleased (pratirata) with the vital airs: it is the
vital airs he thus bestows upon him. Having offered (with the third
stick) he leans it against the middle enclosing-stick.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:35">14:2:2:35</span></span>35.
'Hail to the Fathers, (seated) upon the Barhis <span
id="fr_1286"></span>[1](#fn_1277), and drinking the Gharma!'--even
without offering he secretes (this, the fourth stick) under the barhis
of the south part (of the vedi <span id="fr_1287"></span>[2](#fn_1278))
whilst looking towards the north <span
id="fr_1288"></span>[3](#fn_1279). When the sacrifice had its head cut
off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers--the Fathers
being three in number: it is them he thus pleases. And

<span id="page_488">p. 488</span>

as to why he does not look at it,--once for all the Fathers have passed
away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:36">14:2:2:36</span></span>36.
'Hail to Heaven and Earth!'--heaven and earth being the out (and
in)-breathing and the up-breathing, it is the out and up-breathing he
thus bestows upon him. Having offered (with the fifth stick) he leans it
against the middle enclosing-stick.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:37">14:2:2:37</span></span>37.
'Hail to the All-gods!'--the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* being the vital airs, it is
the vital airs he thus bestows upon him. Having offered (with the sixth
stick) he leans it against the middle enclosing-stick.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:38">14:2:2:38</span></span>38.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 16,\] 'Hail to Rudra, praised by the Rudras <span
id="fr_1289"></span>[1](#fn_1280)!'--even without offering (with this,
the seventh stick), he, looking southwards, hands it to the
Pratiprasthât*ri*, and the latter throws it outside (the
offering-ground) northwards to the north of the hall, for this is the
region of that god: he thus gratifies him in his own region. And as to
why he does not look at it, he does so thinking, 'Lest Rudra should do
me harm.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:39">14:2:2:39</span></span>39.
There are seven of these oblations, for seven in number are these
(channels of the) vital airs in the head: it is these he thus bestows
upon him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:40">14:2:2:40</span></span>40.
He then pours (the remaining milk and ghee) from the Mahâvîra into the
supporting-tray with, 'Hail, light with light!'--for light indeed the
milk was in the one (vessel), and light it is in the other, and these
two lights thus unite with each other. The call of 'hail!' he places
first, and the deity last: the mystic import of this is the same as
before.

<span id="page_489">p. 489</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:41">14:2:2:41</span></span>41.
He then offers (the second of) the two Rauhi*n*a <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[1](#fn_1281) (cakes) with, 'May the day be pleased
with its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!'--the mystic
import of this is the same as before;--'may the night be pleased with
its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!'--the mystic
import of this is the same as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:42">14:2:2:42</span></span>42.
He then hands to the Sacrificer the remainder of the Gharma. He, having
solicited an invitation <span id="fr_1291"></span>[2](#fn_1282) (to the
meal), drinks it with, 'Offered is the honey unto Agni, the greatest of
Indras,'--'Offered is the honey unto Agni, the most powerful,' he
thereby means to say; 'let us eat of thee, god Gharma: reverence be unto
thee, injure us not!'--a blessing he thereby invokes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:43">14:2:2:43</span></span>43.
Now, on the south side sand has been strewn; there they cleanse
themselves <span id="fr_1292"></span>[3](#fn_1283): in this there is the

<span id="page_490">p. 490</span>

same significance as in the Mâr*g*âlîya. The pieces of wood he throws
into the fire. They then proceed with the Upasad. And thus the head of
the sacrifice has been set right in the very same manner in which the
A*s*vins then restored it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:44">14:2:2:44</span></span>44.
One must not perform the Pravargya at one's first Soma-sacrifice, since
that would be sinful, and lest Indra should cut off his head; but at the
second or the third (Soma-sacrifice); for at first the gods went on
worshipping and toiling with the headless sacrifice, therefore (he
should do so) at the second or the third (sacrifice). Moreover, it will
become heated and ablaze;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:45">14:2:2:45</span></span>45.
And were he to perform the Pravargya at the first Soma-sacrifice, that
(Mahâvîra) of his, when heated and ablaze, would burn up his family and
cattle, and also his life, and the Sacrificer would be liable to perish:
therefore (let him perform it) at the second or third (sacrifice).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:46">14:2:2:46</span></span>46.
Let him not perform the Pravargya for any and every one, lest he should
do everything for every one, for the Pravargya is everything; but let
him only perform it for him who is known, or to whoever may be dear to
him, or who has studied sacred writ: by means of the study of sacred
writ he would thus gain it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:47">14:2:2:47</span></span>47.
One may perform the Pravargya for a thousand (head of cattle) <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[1](#fn_1284), for a thousand means everything, and
that (Pravargya) is everything. One may

<span id="page_491">p. 491</span>

perform it for all (the Sacrificer's) property; for all one's property
means everything, and this (Pravargya) is everything. One may perform it
at a Vi*s*va*g*it with all the P*ri*sh*th*as <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1](#fn_1285); for the Vi*s*va*g*it (all-conquering
day) with all the P*ri*sh*th*as means everything, and this (Pravargya)
is everything One may perform it at the Vâ*g*apeya (and) Râ*g*asûya, for
such (a ceremony) means everything. One may perform it at a sacrificial
session, for the session means everything, and this (Pravargya) is
everything. These are (the occasions for) his performances of the
Pravargya, and (let him perform it) nowhere else but at these.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:48">14:2:2:48</span></span>48.
Here now they say, 'Seeing that the Pravargya is headless, whereby,
then, does the Agnihotra become possessed of a head for him?' Let him
say, 'By the Âhavanîya.'--'How the New and Full-moon sacrifices?' Let
him say, 'By the ghee and the cake.'--'How the Seasonal sacrifices?' Let
him say, 'By the oblation of clotted curds <span
id="fr_1295"></span>[2](#fn_1286).'--'How the animal sacrifice?' Let him
say, 'By the victim and the cake.'--'How the Soma-sacrifice?' Let him
say, 'By the Havirdhâna <span id="fr_1296"></span>[3](#fn_1287).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:49">14:2:2:49</span></span>49.
And they also say,--when the sacrifice had its head cut off, the gods on
that occasion restored it as the hospitable reception <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[4](#fn_1288) (of King Soma), and verily for him who
so knows this offering is not made with any headless sacrifice whatever.

<span id="page_492">p. 492</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:50">14:2:2:50</span></span>50.
And, again, they say, 'Seeing that at the sacrifice they lead forward
the Pra*n*îtâ <span id="fr_1298"></span>[1](#fn_1289) (water), wherefore
do they not lead it forward on this occasion?' Well, this--to wit, the
Pra*n*îtâ (water)--being the head of the sacrifice, and the Pravargya
also being its head, (he does so) thinking, 'Lest I cause the head to be
overtopped by a head.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:51">14:2:2:51</span></span>51.
And, again, they say, 'Seeing that elsewhere there are fore-offerings
and after-offerings, wherefore are there not any on this occasion?'
Well, the fore-offerings and after-offerings being the vital airs, and
so also the Avakâ*s*as <span id="fr_1299"></span>[2](#fn_1290), and the
pieces of wood, (it is so) lest he should cause the vital airs to be
overtopped by vital airs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:52">14:2:2:52</span></span>52.
And, again, they say, 'Seeing that elsewhere they offer two
butter-portions, wherefore does he not offer them on this occasion?'
Well, those two--to wit, the butter-portions--being the eyes of the
sacrifice, and so also the two Rauhi*n*a (cakes)--(it is so) lest he
should overtop eye by eye.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:53">14:2:2:53</span></span>53.
And, again, they say, 'Seeing that they make offering to the gods by
means of wooden (vessels), wherefore does he offer this (Gharma) by
means of one made of clay?' When the Sacrifice had its head cut off, its
life-sap flowed away and entered the heaven and the earth. Now this
(earth) is clay, and yonder (sky) is water; and the Mahâvîra (vessels)
are made of clay and water: thus he supplies and completes it (the
Pravargya) with that life-sap.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:54">14:2:2:54</span></span>54.
But if it were made of wood, it would be

<span id="page_493">p. 493</span>

burnt; and if of gold, it would dissolve; and if of copper, it would
melt; and if of stone, it would burn the two handling-sticks; and that
(Gharma) itself submitted to that (earthen vessel): therefore it is by
means of an earthen one that he offers it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:2:2:55">14:2:2:55</span></span>55.
And, verily, whosoever either, teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya)
enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as
at the creation <span id="fr_1300"></span>[1](#fn_1291).

<span id="fn_1267"></span>[482:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1276) Viz. past the
Âhavanîya, along its back (or western) side, to the south side of the
fire.

<span id="fn_1268"></span>[482:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1277) See part i, p.
132, note; III, 4, 4, 11 seqq.

<span id="fn_1269"></span>[483:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1278) The exact
meaning of 'hârdvânam' is doubtful. Mahîdhara analyses it by 'hârd' =
'h*ri*d', + 'vâna,' blowing, going, hence 'heart-wafting, going to the
heart = dear to the heart.' The St. Petersb. Dict. takes the word to be
'hârd-van,' in the sense of 'herzstärkend' (heart-sustaining,
invigorating--? literally, 'possessed of heartiness'). The Taitt. Âr.
has 'hârdivânam' instead. The author of the Brâhma*n*a apparently
considers the term as obscure, and uses this circumstance for his own
symbolic purposes.

<span id="fn_1270"></span>[483:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1279) Perhaps the
author means to characterise also the epithet <span id="page_484">p.
484</span> 'ahar-diva' (lit. 'day-daily,' cf. Germ. tagtäglich;
Aberdonian 'daily-day') as obscure. Mahîdhara takes it to mean 'relating
to morning and evening,' as applying to the two performances of the
Pravargya,

<span id="fn_1271"></span>[484:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1280) They approved of
it by saying 'Well done'; Mahîdh.

<span id="fn_1272"></span>[484:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1281) That is, as
would seem, he speaks the anumantra*n*a in order to consecrate whatever
milk might have been spilled in bubbling over. Possibly, however, he is
to do so at the time when the pot bubbles over (though the 'atha' would
rather be out of place in that case). The Taittirîyas differ somewhat on
this point of the performance. <span id="page_485">p. 485</span> After
the Gharma-milk has been offered, the Pratiprasthât*ri* fills the
Mahâvîra pot, whilst it is held over the fire, with boiled sour curds
and whey (dadhi), whilst muttering the text, 'The A*s*vins drank the
Gharma . . .,' and with the texts; 'For freshness swell thou,' &c.

<span id="fn_1273"></span>[485:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1282) The author
apparently takes 'ameni' in the sense of 'amanyu.' <span
id="page_486">p. 486</span> The St. Petersb. Dict. assigns to it the
meaning 'not shooting, incapable of shooting.'

<span id="fn_1274"></span>[486:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1283) For these pieces
of wood, or large chips, of Vikaṅkata wood (Flacourtia sapida) which
were laid round the pot, see [XIV, 1, 3, 26](sbe44119.htm#14:1:3:26).
They are dipped into the remains of the hot milk and ghee, the liquid
adhering to them being then offered.

<span id="fn_1275"></span>[486:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1284) That is, that
one of the three fresh sticks enclosing the fire which is laid down
first, along the back, or west side, and forms the base of a triangle
the apex of which points eastwards. Cf. I, 3, 4, 1 seqq.

<span id="fn_1276"></span>[486:3](sbe44122.htm#fr_1285) This meaning is,
by the St. Petersb. Dict., assigned to 'prati-rava' <span
id="page_487">p. 487</span> (otherwise 'echo'), the proper term for the
sounding-holes being 'upa-rava,' cf. III, 5, 4, 1, where they are
likened to the eyes and ears, as channels of the vital airs.

<span id="fn_1277"></span>[487:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1286) If this
rendering (St. Petersb. Dict.) of ûrdhvabarhis' is correct--the term
being apparently based on the Fathers’ epithet 'barhishada*h*,' 'seated
on the barhis' (sacrificial grass-covering of the altar-ground)--the
force of 'ûrdhva' in the compound is very peculiar. Mahîdhara takes it
in the sense of 'having their barhis pointed upwards,' i.e. towards the
east (!), the peculiar feature of the barhis in the present case--as far
as the participation of the Fathers in the drinking of the Gharma is
concerned--being its having the tops of the grass-stalks turned to the
east instead of to the south, as is the case in all ceremonies relating
to the Fathers. The term 'ûrdhvabarhis' might possibly mean 'having
their (special) barhis above,' i.e. in the world of the Fathers, where
they would be supposed to partake of the libations of hot milk; whilst
yet another (suggested by the next paragraph) would be that of 'having
the barhis above them;' which would, however, be more appropriate if the
secreting of the stick under the barhis applied to the present, instead
of the next one.

<span id="fn_1278"></span>[487:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1287) The comm. on
Kâty. XXVI, 6, 14 calls this part of the barhis 'âtithyâbarhis' (?).

<span id="fn_1279"></span>[487:3](sbe44122.htm#fr_1288) And accordingly,
without looking at it.

<span id="fn_1280"></span>[488:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1289) Or, 'having his
praises sung by the chanters,' as Mahîdhara takes 'rudrahûti.'

<span id="fn_1281"></span>[489:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1290) Viz. [XIV, 2, 1,
1](sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:1).

<span id="fn_1282"></span>[489:2](sbe44122.htm#fr_1291) Viz. at the
hands of the officiating priests, by saying to each, Invite me, N.N.
whereupon each of them replies, "Thou art invited.' Cf. XII, 8, 3, 30.
According to Âpast. *S*r. XV, 11, 12, the priests and the Sacrificer
partake of the residue in the order--Hot*ri*, Adhvaryu, Brahman,
Pratiprasthât*ri*, Agnîdh, and Sacrificer; or, optionally (ib. 14), only
the Sacrificer drinks of it, whilst the priests merely smell it. Cf. the
eating of the whey (of clotted curds), II, 4, 4, 25, to which the
present eating of the remains is stated, by Kâty. XXVI, 6, 20, to be
analogous; whilst the offering is said to be on the model of the
Agnihotra.

<span id="fn_1283"></span>[489:3](sbe44122.htm#fr_1292) The usual place
to do so is over the pit (*k*âtrâla), cf. III, 8, 2, 30; XII, 8, 1, 22;
whilst the utensils are cleaned in the Mâr*g*âlîya. On the present
occasion a mound of sand (or covered with sand)--the so-called
'u*kkh*ish*t*a-khara' (mound of remains)--is raised in the south part of
the *s*âlâ, close to the mat or hurdle forming its wall, just east of
the southern door. According to Kâty. XXVI, 6, 21 seqq., Âpast. XV, 12,
1 seqq., the Mahâvîra and the remaining <span id="page_490">p.
490</span> apparatus are then in solemn fashion (carried round in front
of the Âhavanîya, and) placed on the throne-seat, and consecrated (or
appeased) by being sprinkled with water.

<span id="fn_1284"></span>[490:1](sbe44122.htm#fr_1293) That is, at a
sacrifice for which this constitutes the sacrificial fee.
