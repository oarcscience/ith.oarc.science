### EIGHTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### FUNERAL CEREMONIES.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:1">13:8:1:1</span></span>1. They
now <span id="fr_1118"></span>[2](#fn_1111.md) do what is auspicious for
him. They now prepare a burial-place (*s*ma*s*âna <span
id="fr_1119"></span>[3](#fn_1112).md) for him,

<span id="page_422">p. 422</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (to serve him)
either as a house or as a monument; for when any one dies, he is a
corpse (*s*ava), and for that (corpse) food (anna) is thereby prepared,
hence '*s*avanna,' for, indeed, '*s*avanna' is what is mystically called
'*s*ma*s*âna.' But '*s*ma*s*â*h*' also are called the eaters amongst the
Fathers, and they, indeed, destroy in yonder world the good deeds of him
who has had no sepulchre prepared for him: it is for them that he
prepares that food, whence it is '*s*ma*s*ânna,' for '*s*ma*s*ânna' is
what is mystically called '*s*ma*s*âna.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:2">13:8:1:2</span></span>2. Let
him <span id="fr_1120"></span>[1](#fn_1113.md) not make it too soon (after
the deceased man's death) lest he should freshen up his sin; but let him
make it a long time after, as thereby he obscures the sin;--and when
people do not even remember the years (that have passed <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[2](#fn_1114).md), as thereby one causes the sin to
pass into oblivion. If they do remember <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[3](#fn_1115.md),--

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:3">13:8:1:3</span></span>3. Let
him make it in uneven years, since the uneven belongs to the Fathers;
and under a single Nakshatra <span id="fr_1123"></span>[1](#fn_1116.md),
since the single Nakshatra belongs to the Fathers; and at new-moon,
since the new-moon is a single Nakshatra;--for he (the Sacrificer) is a
single (person); and in that all the beings dwell together during that
night, thereby he obtains that object of desire which is (contained) in
all Nakshatras.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:4">13:8:1:4</span></span>4. Let
him make it in autumn, for the autumn is the Svadhâ, and the Svadhâ is
the food of the Fathers: he thus places him along with food, the
Svadhâ;--or in (the month of) Mâgha, thinking, 'Lest (mâ) sin (agha) be
in us;'--or in summer (nidâgha), thinking, 'May thereby be removed
(nidhâ) our sin (agha)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:5">13:8:1:5</span></span>5.
Four-cornered (is the sepulchral mound). Now the gods and the Asuras,
both of them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, were contending in the (four)
regions (quarters). The gods drove out the Asuras, their rivals and
enemies, from the regions, and, being regionless, they were overcome.
Wherefore the people who are godly make their burial-places
four-cornered, whilst those who are of the Asura nature, the Easterns
and others <span id="fr_1124"></span>[2](#fn_1117), (make them.md)

<span id="page_424">p. 424</span>

round, for they (the gods) drove them out from the regions. He arranges
it so as to lie between the two regions, the eastern and the
southern <span id="fr_1125"></span>[1](#fn_1118.md), for in that region
assuredly is the door to the world of the Fathers: through the above he
thus causes him to enter the world of the Fathers; and by means of the
(four) corners he (the deceased) establishes himself in the regions, and
by means of the other body <span id="fr_1126"></span>[2](#fn_1119.md) (of
the tomb) in the intermediate regions: he thus establishes him in all
the regions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:6">13:8:1:6</span></span>6. Now
as to the choosing of the ground. He makes it on ground inclining
towards the north, for the north is the region of men: he thus gives him
(the deceased) a share in the world of men; and in that respect, indeed,
the Fathers share in the world of men that they have offspring; and his
(the deceased man's) offspring will, indeed, be more prosperous.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:7">13:8:1:7</span></span>7. 'Let
him make it on ground inclining towards the south,' they say, 'for the
world of the Fathers inclines towards the south: he thus gives him a
share in the world of the Fathers.' Let him not do so, however, for,
indeed, such a one is an opening tomb, and certainly another of these
(members of the dead man's family) quickly follows him in death.

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:8">13:8:1:8</span></span>8. And
some, indeed, say, 'Let him make it on a counter-cutting <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[1](#fn_1120.md) in ground inclined towards the south,
for such (a tomb) indeed becomes rising sin <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[2](#fn_1121.md).' But one must not do so, for indeed
such (a burial place) alone becomes rising sin which one makes, on
ground inclining towards the north.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:9">13:8:1:9</span></span>9. On
any level (ground) where the waters, flowing thither from a
south-easterly direction <span id="fr_1129"></span>[3](#fn_1122.md), and
coming to a stand-still, will, on reaching that (north-westerly)
quarter, without pressing forward <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[4](#fn_1123.md), join imperishable water <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[5](#fn_1124), on that (ground.md) one may make (the
tomb); for, water being food, one thereby offers food to him from the
front towards the back; and, water being the drink of immortality, and
that region between the rising of the seven *Ri*shis <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[6](#fn_1125.md) and the setting of the sun being the
quarter of the living, one thereby bestows the drink of immortality upon
the living:--and such a one, indeed, is a closing tomb; and verily what
is good for the living that is also good for the Fathers.

<span id="page_426">p. 426</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:10">13:8:1:10</span></span>10.
Let him make it in a pleasant (spot), in order that there should be
pleasure for him; and in a peaceful (spot), in order that there should
be peace for him. He must not make it either on a path, or in an open
space, lest he should make his (the deceased's) sin manifest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:11">13:8:1:11</span></span>11.
Whilst being secluded it should have the sun shining on it from
above <span id="fr_1133"></span>[1](#fn_1126.md): in that it is secluded
one hides his sin; and in that it has the sun shining on it from
above---yonder sun being the remover of evil--he, indeed, removes the
evil from him, and he also causes him to be endowed with the radiance of
the sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:12">13:8:1:12</span></span>12.
Let him not make it where it would be visible from here <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[2](#fn_1127.md), for assuredly it is beckoning, and
another of these (members of his family) quickly follows (the deceased)
in death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:13">13:8:1:13</span></span>13.
Let there be beautiful objects <span id="fr_1135"></span>[3](#fn_1128.md)
at the back,--for beautiful objects mean offspring: beautiful objects,
offspring, will thus accrue to him. If there be no beautiful objects,
let there be water either at the back or on the left (north) side, for
water is indeed a beautiful object; and beautiful objects, offspring,
will indeed accrue to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:14">13:8:1:14</span></span>14.
He makes it on salt (barren) soil, for salt means seed; the productive
thus makes him partake in productiveness, and in that respect, indeed,
the

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fathers partake in
productiveness that they have offspring: his offspring assuredly will be
more prosperous.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:15">13:8:1:15</span></span>15.
On such (ground) as is filled with roots, for to the Fathers belongs the
(sod) filled with roots;--it is (sod) of vîri*n*a (Andropogon muricatus)
and other grasses, for thus the Fathers’ share in this (earth) is not
excessive <span id="fr_1136"></span>[1](#fn_1129.md); and he also thereby
makes (the deceased's) sin to be restricted <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[2](#fn_1130.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:16">13:8:1:16</span></span>16.
Let him not put it near (where grows) Bhûmipâ*s*a <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[3](#fn_1131.md), or reeds, or A*s*magandhâ <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[4](#fn_1132.md), or Adhyâ*nd*â, or P*ris*nipar*n*î
('speckled-leaf,' Hemionitis cordifolia); nor let him make it near
either an A*s*vattha (Ficus religiosa), or a Vibhîtaka (Terminalia
bellerica), or a Tilvaka (Symplocos racemosa), or a Sphûr*g*aka
(Diospyros embryopteris), or a Haridru (Pinus deodora), or a Nyagrodha
(Ficus indica), or

<span id="page_428">p. 428</span>

any other (trees) of evil name <span id="fr_1140"></span>[1](#fn_1133.md),
so as to avoid (such) names from a desire of good luck.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:17">13:8:1:17</span></span>17.
Now as to the order of procedure. For an Agni*k*it (builder of a
fire-altar) one makes the tomb after the manner of the fire-altar; for
when a Sacrificer builds a fire-altar he thereby constructs for himself
by sacrifice a (new) body for yonder world; but that sacrificial
performance is not complete until the making of a tomb; and when he
makes the tomb of the Agni*k*it after the manner of the fire-altar, it
is thereby he completes the Agni*k*ityâ.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:18">13:8:1:18</span></span>18.
One must not make it (too) large lest he should make the sin (of the
deceased) large. 'Let him make it as large as the fire-altar without
wings and tail,' say some, 'for like that of the fire-altar is this his
(the Sacrificer's) body.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:19">13:8:1:19</span></span>19.
But let him rather make it just of man's size: he thus leaves no room
for another;--broader (varîyas) behind <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[2](#fn_1134), for what is (left.md) behind is
offspring: he thus makes the (dead man's) offspring more excellent <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[3](#fn_1135) (varîyas.md);--and broader on the left
(north <span id="fr_1143"></span>[4](#fn_1136) or higher, uttara.md) side,
for the later (uttara)

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span>

are offspring: he thus makes the offspring more excellent. Having
attended to this, he encloses it with cords twisted (and extended) in
the non-sunwise way <span id="fr_1144"></span>[1](#fn_1137.md); for the
(sacrificial) performance connected with the Fathers is done in the
non-sunwise way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:1:20">13:8:1:20</span></span>20.
He then bids them cut out (the earth). He should cut it out to whatever
extent he intends to raise (the sepulchral mound), but let him rather
cut it out so as to be just of man's size: he thus leaves no room for
another. For, on the one hand <span id="fr_1145"></span>[2](#fn_1138.md),
the Fathers are the world of plants, and amongst the roots of plants
they (are wont to) hide; and, on the other <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[2](#fn_1138), (he does so) lest he (the deceased.md)
should be separated from this (earth).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1111"></span>[421:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1118.md) The commentator
is at pains to show that 'atha' here has not the force of
'thereupon'--that is after the performance of the Sarvamedha--but that
of introducing a new topic ('Now, they do . . .'); and that therefore
the directions about to be given are by no means intended to apply only
to one who has performed the Sarvamedha, or even to the Agni*k*it, or
builder of a fire-altar, but also to others.

<span id="fn_1112"></span>[421:3](sbe44113.htm#fr_1119.md) Yâska (Nir. III,
5) resolves this word into '*s*man' (body) + '*s*ayana' (couch); whilst
Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 189, proposes 'a*s*man' (stone) +
'*s*ayana' (couch). The *s*ma*s*âna; or burial-place, sepulchre, is
constructed in the form of a tumulus, or grave-mound.

<span id="fn_1113"></span>[422:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1120.md) Viz. the
Sacrificer, the performer of the funeral rites, being the next of kin.

<span id="fn_1114"></span>[422:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1121.md) This is the way
in which the scholiasts interpret the corresponding rule, Kâty. Sr. XXI,
3, 1 (pit*ri*mdha*h* sa*m*vatsarâsm*ri*tau), instead of 'when they do
not remember it (even once) for years, he brings it about that the sin
is forgotten, even in case they should remember it,' as Prof. Delbrück,
Altind. Syntax, p. 351 translates the passage. For the subject of the
verb 'they remember it,' Prof. Delbrück supplies 'pitara*h*,' i.e. the
dead man's deceased ancestors, instead of the living people, which seems
rather improbable. The comment is very corrupt, but it makes at least
some allusion to 'people's talk':--na *s*ruti*h* *s*rutyabhâvas (ta*m*)
tena *k*irakara*n*ena agha*m* pâpakara*n*a*m* gamayati, *k*irât
*s*ma*s*âna*m* kurva*s*rara*n*a*m* (? kurvata*h* *s*rava*n*a*m*)
*g*anavâdo<sup>ऽ</sup>pi na *srin*otîty (!) artha*h*.

<span id="fn_1115"></span>[422:3](sbe44113.htm#fr_1122.md) In this way
Harisvâmin, as well as the scholiasts on Kâty. XXI, 3, 2, construes the
clause with the next paragraph, and it is difficult to see how otherwise
any satisfactory sense could be extracted from it. At the same time, it
can evidently only qualify the first specification of time, as the
others will apply in any case.

<span id="fn_1116"></span>[423:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1123.md) That is, a lunar
mansion consisting of a single star, such as *K*itrâ and Pushya (in
contradistinction to such in the dual, as Punarvasû and Vi*s*âkhe, and
to those in the plural number, as the K*ri*ttikâs). As regards the
symbolic connection of the uneven number with the deceased ancestors,
the commentator reminds us of the fact that it is the father,
grandfather, and great-grandfather who represent the Fathers.--The only
available MS. of the commentary (Ind. Off. 149) terminates at this
place.

<span id="fn_1117"></span>[423:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1124.md) Yâ âsurya*h*
prâ*k*yâs tvad ye tvat parima*nd*alâni (*s*ma*s*ânâni kurvate),--Prof.
Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 189, takes this in the sense of 'part of the
prâ*k*ya, the âsurya*h* pra*g*â*h* of them (hence probably <span
id="page_424">p. 424</span> the non-Âryan portion of them), have round
*s*ma*s*âna.' J. Muir, Orig. Sansk. Texts, vol. ii, p. 485, takes no
account of the words 'tvad ye tvat.' For our rendering of these words,
cp. V, 3, 2, 2 *s*ûdrâ*m*s tvad yâ*m*s tvat, '*S*ûdras and others,' or
'*S*ûdras and suchlike people.'

<span id="fn_1118"></span>[424:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1125.md) That is to say,
its front side is towards the south-east. Cp. [p. 428](#page_428.md), note
[4](#fn_1136.md).

<span id="fn_1119"></span>[424:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1126.md) That is, by
means of the sides of the grave which are to face the intermediate
points of the compass.

<span id="fn_1120"></span>[425:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1127.md) This is meant as
a literal rendering of 'pratyarsha.' What is intended thereby would seem
to be either a cutting made into southward sloping ground, in such a way
as to make the cut piece of ground rise towards the south, or perhaps
such a part of the southward inclined ground as naturally rises towards
the south. The St. Petersburg Dict. suggests 'steep bank (escarpment),
or side (of a hill).' Kâty. XXI, 3, 15 (kakshe) seems also to imply some
kind of hollow ground, surrounded by bushes and trees.

<span id="fn_1121"></span>[425:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1128.md) That is,
apparently, lightened, or improving, sin.

<span id="fn_1122"></span>[425:3](sbe44113.htm#fr_1129.md) It might also
mean, in a south-easterly direction, but the comparison with food
introduced into the mouth from the front (east) and the specification of
the opposite direction evidently point to the above meaning.

<span id="fn_1123"></span>[425:4](sbe44113.htm#fr_1130.md) That is, without
urging forward the standing water which they join, but quickly flowing
into it.

<span id="fn_1124"></span>[425:5](sbe44113.htm#fr_1131.md) That is,
apparently, such a lake as never dries up.

<span id="fn_1125"></span>[425:6](sbe44113.htm#fr_1132.md) That is, *Ursa
major*, the Great Bear, or Charles's Wain.

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[426:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1133.md) That is, it
should be in a place where at midday the rays of the sun do not fall
obliquely on it, Kâty. XXI, 3, 15 comm.

<span id="fn_1127"></span>[426:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1134.md) That is, from
the village, cf. Kâty. XXI, 3, 18.

<span id="fn_1128"></span>[426:3](sbe44113.htm#fr_1135.md) Or, beautiful
ground (*k*itra). According to the comments on Kâty. XXI, 3, 23 this
means that the site of the grave should be so chosen that there are at
the back (or west) of it, either woods of various kinds, or ground
diversified by woods, hills, temples (!) &c.

<span id="fn_1129"></span>[427:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1136.md) Whilst their
share would have been excessive, if all the ground covered with
vegetation were assigned to them. It is also worthy of note that Kâty.
Sr. XXV, 7, 17, in enumerating the plants which are to be removed from
the site of the funeral pile, mentions (apparently in the place of our
Bhûmipâ*s*â) the Vi*s*âkha, explained by the commentator as identical
with 'dûrvâ'; and Sir H. M. Elliott, Races of the N. W. Province of
India, II, p. 303, remarks, on the Dûb grass (Agrestis linearis, or
Cynodon dactylon), that 'its tenacity whenever it once fixes its roots
has caused it to be used in a common simile when the attachment of
Zamiṅdârs to their native soil is spoken of.'

<span id="fn_1130"></span>[427:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1137.md) Apparently lit.
'binding (itself),'? i.e. either restricted in quantity, or limited to
his own person, not transmitted to his son. Cf. XIII, 8, 3, 10. It can
hardly be taken in the sense of 'binding the sin.'

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[427:3](sbe44113.htm#fr_1138.md) Literally,
'Earth-net,' apparently some troublesome creeping plant corresponding to
our rest-harrow (Ononis arvensis or spinosa), or couch-grass (Triticum
repens), but of tropical dimensions.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[427:4](sbe44113.htm#fr_1139.md) Lit.
'rock-smell,' perhaps identical with A*s*vagandhâ (lit. 'horse-smell,'
Physalis flexuosa).

<span id="fn_1133"></span>[428:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1140.md) The commentator,
on Kâty. XXI, 3, 20, and Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 1, instances the *s*leshmântaka
('antiphlegmatic,' i.e. Cordia latifolia or myxa) and the kovidâra ('bad
for splitting,' Bauhinia variegata; which, according to Stewart and
Brandis, shows vertical cracks in the bark).

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[428:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1141.md) The grave being
constructed in such a way that the four corners lie in the direction of
the four quarters, the back, or west side of the grave would really mean
the side facing the north-west.

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[428:3](sbe44113.htm#fr_1142.md) Or, perhaps,
more extended, more numerous or prosperous.

<span id="fn_1136"></span>[428:4](sbe44113.htm#fr_1143.md) In reality, the
north means here the side facing the north-east. The side of the tumulus
is to form a quadrilateral, of which the two sides intersecting each
other at the north corner, are to be longer than the two which intersect
at the south corner; viz. each of the <span id="page_429">p. 429</span>
former is to measure one man's length plus 9¼ aṅgulas (thumb's
breadths), and each of the latter one man's length minus 9¼ aṅgulas. See
comm. on Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 1.

<span id="fn_1137"></span>[429:1](sbe44113.htm#fr_1144.md) That is, by
twisting or spinning the strands from right to left, or contrary to the
sun's course. The cord is extended round the grave from right to left
(east, north, west, south) by means of pegs driven into the ground at
the four corners; see [XIII, 8, 4, 1](sbe44116.htm#13:8:4:1.md).

<span id="fn_1138"></span>[429:2](sbe44113.htm#fr_1146.md) I do not see how
the usual force of 'atho'--viz. that of introducing a new element or
argument either analogous, or not quite conformable, to what precedes
(cf. Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 513)--can apply to this double use of
the particle. The two 'atho' seem to introduce the reasons for his
digging up the ground, and for his not digging up more than a man's
size.
