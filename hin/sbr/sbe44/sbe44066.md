### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:1">12:7:2:1</span></span>1.
Verily, his fiery spirit, his energy, or vital power, depart from him
whom Soma purges either upwards or downwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:2">12:7:2:2</span></span>2. As
to this they say, 'Truly, the Soma-juice is the Brâhma*n*a's food; and,
indeed, it is not owing to Soma when a Brâhma*n*a vomits Soma; and he
who vomits Soma is one who, whilst being fit to (gain) prosperity, does
not gain prosperity, and who, whilst being fit to (gain) cattle, does
not gain cattle <span id="fr_571"></span>[1](#fn_569), for Soma is
cattle.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:3">12:7:2:3</span></span>3. Let
him seize for sacrifice that grey (he-goat) of the A*s*vins, the ram of
Sarasvatî, and the bull of Indra; for the A*s*vins are the physicians of
the gods, and it is by them that he heals this (Sacrificer); and
Sarasvatî is healing medicine, and it is with her help that he prepares
medicine for him; and Indra is energy (indriya), or vital power, and it
is with his help that he bestows energy, or vital power, on this
(Sacrificer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:4">12:7:2:4</span></span>4. The
two A*s*vins, indeed, are the eyesight,

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

fiery spirit; and inasmuch as there is (a victim) sacred to the
A*s*vins, he (the priest) bestows eyesight, fiery spirit, on this
(Sacrificer). And the ear also (he thereby bestows on him), for one and
the same are the eye and the ear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:5">12:7:2:5</span></span>5.
Sarasvatî is the breath, vital power; and inasmuch as there is (a
victim) sacred to Sarasvatî, he bestows breath, vital power, on this
(Sacrificer). And the off-breathing also (he thereby bestows on him),
for one and the same are the breath (of the mouth) and the of breathing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:6">12:7:2:6</span></span>6.
Indra is speech, strength; and inasmuch as there is (a victim) sacred to
Indra, he bestows speech, strength, on this (Sacrificer); and mind also,
for one and the same are speech and mind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:7">12:7:2:7</span></span>7.
'He-goats are sacred to the A*s*vins, ewes to Sarasvatî, and cows (and
bulls) to Indra,' they say: if these animals are sacrificed, he, by
means of those deities, gains those (three) animals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:8">12:7:2:8</span></span>8.
There is a mare with a foal <span id="fr_572"></span>[1](#fn_570): the
one-hoofed (animal),glory, he thereby secures (for the Sacrificer <span
id="fr_573"></span>[2](#fn_571)). There are hairs of wild beasts <span
id="fr_574"></span>[3](#fn_572), for the purpose of securing the wild
beasts;--there are hairs of wolf: vigour, the impetuous rush of wild
beasts, he thereby secures;--there are hairs of tiger: courage, the sway
of wild beasts, he thereby secures;--there are hairs

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

of lion: might, the rule of wild beasts, he thereby secures.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:9">12:7:2:9</span></span>9.
There are grains of rice and grains of millet, grains of wheat and
kuvala jujubes, Indra-grain and badara jujubes, grains of barley and
karkandhu jujubes, malted rice and barley <span
id="fr_575"></span>[1](#fn_573): both cultivated and wild-grain food he
thereby secures; and by means of both kinds of food he duly lays energy
and vital power into his own self.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:10">12:7:2:10</span></span>10.
With lead he buys <span id="fr_576"></span>[2](#fn_574) the malted rice,
with (sheep's) wool the malted barley, with thread the (fried)
rice-grain,--that lead is a form of both iron and gold, and the
Sautrâma*n*î is both an ish*t*i-offering and an animal sacrifice, so
that he thereby secures both of these.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:11">12:7:2:11</span></span>11.
With wool and thread <span id="fr_577"></span>[3](#fn_575) he
buys,--this, to wit, wool and thread, is women's work; and work, indeed,
means energy, or vital power, and this latter is extinct in women: he
thus secures (for the Sacrificer) that energy, or vital power, which is
extinct in women.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:12">12:7:2:12</span></span>12.
Here now, other Adhvaryus buy the malted rice with lead from a eunuch,
saying, 'That is that <span id="fr_578"></span>[4](#fn_576); for the
eunuch is neither woman nor man, and the

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sautrâma*n*î is
neither an ish*t*i-offering nor an animal sacrifice.' But let him not do
so, for the Sautrâma*n*î is both an ish*t*i and an animal sacrifice, and
the eunuch is something unsuccessful among men: they who do this thus
place failure into the very mouth (opening) of the sacrifice. Let him
rather buy them from a vendor of Soma, for the Sautrâma*n*î is Soma: he
thus puts a form of Soma into the very mouth of the sacrifice so as to
secure the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:13">12:7:2:13</span></span>13.
There is a pot (kumbhî) perforated with a hundred holes <span
id="fr_579"></span>[1](#fn_577), for in many ways did that (Soma) flow
out of (Indra); and a hundred-sized also, indeed, is the sacrifice: it
is the sacrifice he thereby secures. There is a bowl (rata <span
id="fr_580"></span>[2](#fn_578)): it is the real (or good) thing (sat)
he thereby secures. There is a dish (*k*apya) for him to secure food.
There is a filter, for they cleanse him, (the Sacrificer, by this
offering). There is a tail (-whisk) for turning away evil. There is gold
for him to secure form (or colour); it weighs a hundred (grains), for
man has a life of a hundred (years) and a hundred energies: life, and
energy, vital power, he thus lays into his own self.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:14">12:7:2:14</span></span>14.
There is an a*s*vattha (ficus religiosa) vessel: honour he thereby
secures. There is an udumbara (ficus glomerata) one: force he thereby
secures. There is a nyagrodha (ficus indica) one: sweet drink he thereby
secures. There are (earthen) pots (sthâlî): the food of the earth he
thereby secures.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:15">12:7:2:15</span></span>15.
There are supernumerary <span id="fr_581"></span>[3](#fn_579) (vessels)
of palâ*s*a

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

wood: the palâ*s*a (butea frondosa) is the Brahman (holy writ, holiness,
the priesthood): it is by the Brahman that he gains the heavenly world.
There are two feathers of a talon-slaying (bird) <span
id="fr_582"></span>[1](#fn_580): courage, the sway of birds, he thereby
secures. There are thirty-six of these (objects), for the B*ri*hatî
consists of thirty-six syllables, and cattle are related to the
B*ri*hatî: by means of the B*ri*hatî he thus secures cattle for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:16">12:7:2:16</span></span>16.
As to this they say, 'The victims have one set of deities, and the cakes
another set of deities: this is an improper performance <span
id="fr_583"></span>[2](#fn_581); how does it become right and proper?'
To Indra belongs the last of the victims, and to Indra the first of the
cakes; and Indra, indeed, is energy (indriya), or vital power: through
(Indra's) energy he thus confers on him energy, or vital power; and
through (Indra's) energy he secures energy, or vital power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:17">12:7:2:17</span></span>17.
There is a cake to Savit*ri* for him to become impelled by Savit*ri*;
and one to Varu*n*a, for it is Varu*n*a that seizes him who is seized by
evil: through Varu*n*a he thus delivers him from Varu*n*a's power;--it
is the final (cake): he thus delivers him finally from Varu*n*a's noose.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:18">12:7:2:18</span></span>18.
Indra's (cake) is one on eleven potsherds, in order that he may secure
(Indra's) energy, or vital

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

power; for the Trish*t*ubh consists of eleven syllables, and the
Trish*t*ubh is energy, or vital power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:19">12:7:2:19</span></span>19.
Savit*ri*'s (cake) is one on twelve potsherds, for there are twelve
months in the year, and the year means constantly existing food: from
the year he thus secures for hire food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:20">12:7:2:20</span></span>20.
Varu*n*a's (cake) is one on ten potsherds, for the Virâ*g* consists of
ten syllables, and Varu*n*a is Virâ*g* (the widely ruling), the lord of
food: through Varu*n*a he thus secures food for him. In the middle (of
the sacrifice) they proceed with (the offering of) these cakes, for the
centre means their (mother's) womb: he thus causes them to be produced
from their own (mother's) womb.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:2:21">12:7:2:21</span></span>21. A
mare with a foal is the sacrificial fee, for such a (mare) produces both
the horse and the mule, and the Sautrâma*n*î is both an ish*t*i-offering
and an animal sacrifice: thus it is so in order that he may secure both
of these.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_569"></span>[217:1](sbe44066.htm#fr_571) According to Kâty.
XIX, 1, 4, the Sautrâma*n*î may also be performed by one who finds
himself in the unfortunate position here referred to; as also (acc. to
ib. 3) by a king who has been deprived of his kingdom.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[218:1](sbe44066.htm#fr_572) According to [XII,
9, 2, 11](sbe44072.htm#12:9:2:11), a milch cow with her calf are given
as dakshi*n*â for the two paps offered to Aditi, whilst a mare and foal,
according to [XII, 7, 2, 21](sbe44066.htm#12:7:2:21), are the fee for
the offering of the three victims; though Kâtyâyana, it is true, makes
no mention of this dakshi*n*â.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[218:2](sbe44066.htm#fr_573) Or, perhaps, he
(the Sacrificer) secures for himself; but see [paragraph
15](sbe44066.htm#12:7:2:15), 'asmai avarunddhe.'

<span id="fn_572"></span>[218:3](sbe44066.htm#fr_574) Hairs of a wolf,
tiger, and lion are put into the cups of spirituous liquor from which
libations are made.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[219:1](sbe44066.htm#fr_575) That is, rice and
barley grain that has germinated, and subsequently become dry.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[219:2](sbe44066.htm#fr_576) As on the occasion
of the purchase of Soma-plants (part ii, p. 63 seq.), the bargain is
effected near the anta*h*pâtya-peg at the back of the Vedi, where an
ox-hide is spread for the purpose; the Adhvaryu asking the seller,
'Seller of Surâ and Soma, hast thou Surâ and Soma for sale?'

<span id="fn_575"></span>[219:3](sbe44066.htm#fr_577) Thus
'ûr*n*â-sûtram' is to be resolved, according to Kâty. XIX, 1, 18; the
wool being used for buying malted barley, and the thread for buying
fried rice.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[219:4](sbe44066.htm#fr_578) That is, one is
the same as the other.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[220:1](sbe44066.htm#fr_579) For the use of
this pot, see note on [XII, 8, 1, 8](sbe44068.htm#12:8:1:8).

<span id="fn_578"></span>[220:2](sbe44066.htm#fr_580) See [XII, 8, 3,
14](sbe44070.htm#12:8:3:14). [15](sbe44070.htm#12:8:3:14).

<span id="fn_579"></span>[220:3](sbe44066.htm#fr_581) At III, 7, 2, 1.
2, I would also now translate 'upa*s*aya' by 'supernumerary' or
'additional':--there are eleven stakes, and a twelfth, rough-hewn,
supernumerary one, &c.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[221:1](sbe44066.htm#fr_582) For the use of the
two feathers of an eagle, see [XII, 7, 3, 22](sbe44067.htm#12:7:3:22).

<span id="fn_581"></span>[221:2](sbe44066.htm#fr_583) The rule (as laid
down in III, 8, 3, 1) is that the Pa*s*u-puro*d*â*s*a, or animal cakes,
offered after the animal portions, should belong to the same deities to
whom the victims are sacred. On the present occasion this is, however,
not the case; for while the three sacrificial animals of the main
performance belong to the A*s*vins, to Sarasvatî and Indra, the three
cakes are offered to Indra, Savit*ri*, and Varu*n*a respectively.
