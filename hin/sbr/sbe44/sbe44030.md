### SIXTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE STUDY OF THE VEDA.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:6:1">11:5:6:1</span></span>1.
There are five great sacrifices, and they, indeed, are great sacrificial
sessions,--to wit, the sacrifice to beings, the sacrifice to men, the
sacrifice to the Fathers, the sacrifice to the gods, and the sacrifice
to the Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:6:2">11:5:6:2</span></span>2. Day
by day one should offer an oblation to beings: thus he performs that
sacrifice to beings. Day by day one should offer (presents to guests) up
to the cupful of water <span id="fr_310"></span>[3](#fn_310): thus he
performs that

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

sacrifice to men. Day by day one should offer with Svadhâ up to the
cupful of water <span id="fr_311"></span>[1](#fn_311): thus he performs
that sacrifice to the Fathers. Day by day one should perform with Svâhâ
up to the log of firewood <span id="fr_312"></span>[2](#fn_312): thus he
performs that sacrifice to the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:6:3">11:5:6:3</span></span>3. Then
as to the sacrifice to the Brahman. The sacrifice to the Brahman is
one's own (daily) study (of the Veda). The *g*uhû-spoon of this same
sacrifice to the Brahman is speech, its upabh*ri*t the mind, its dhruvâ
the eye, its sruva mental power, its purificatory bath truth, its
conclusion heaven. And, verily, however great the world he gains by
giving away (to the priests) this earth replete with wealth, thrice that
and more--an imperishable world does he gain, whosoever, knowing this,
studies day by day his lesson (of the Veda): therefore let him study his
daily lesson.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:6:4">11:5:6:4</span></span>4.
Verily, the *Ri*k-texts are milk-offerings to the gods; and whosoever,
knowing this, studies day by day the *Ri*k-texts for his lesson, thereby
satisfies the gods with milk-offerings; and, being satisfied, they
satisfy him by (granting him) security of

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

possession <span id="fr_313"></span>[1](#fn_313), by life-breath, by
seed, by his whole self, and by all auspicious blessings; and rivers of
ghee and rivers of honey flow for his (departed) Fathers, as their
accustomed draughts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:6:5">11:5:6:5</span></span>5. And,
verily, the Ya*g*us-texts are ghee-offerings to the gods; and whosoever,
knowing this, studies day by day the Ya*g*us-texts for his lesson
thereby satisfies the gods with ghee-offerings; and, being satisfied,
they satisfy him by security of possession, by life-breath, by seed, by
his whole self, and by all auspicious blessings; and rivers of ghee and
rivers of honey flow for his Fathers, as their accustomed draughts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:6:6">11:5:6:6</span></span>6. And,
verily, the Sâman-texts are Soma-offerings to the gods; and whosoever,
knowing this, studies day by day the Sâman-texts for his lesson thereby
satisfies the gods with Soma-offerings; and, being satisfied, they
satisfy him by security of possession, by life-breath, by seed, by his
whole self, and by all auspicious blessings; and rivers of ghee and
rivers of honey flow for his Fathers, as their accustomed draughts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:6:7">11:5:6:7</span></span>7. And,
verily, the (texts of the) Atharvâṅgiras are fat-offerings to the gods;
and whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day the (texts of the)
Atharvâṅgiras for his lesson, satisfies the gods with fat-offerings;
and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by security of possession, by
life-breath, by seed, by his whole self, and by all auspicious
blessings; and rivers of ghee and rivers of honey flow for his Fathers,
as their accustomed draughts.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:6:8">11:5:6:8</span></span>8. And,
verily, the precepts <span id="fr_314"></span>[1](#fn_314), the
sciences <span id="fr_315"></span>[2](#fn_315), the dialogue <span
id="fr_316"></span>[3](#fn_316), the traditional myths and legends <span
id="fr_317"></span>[4](#fn_317), and the Nârâ*s*a*m*sî Gâthâs <span
id="fr_318"></span>[5](#fn_318) are honey-offerings to the gods; and
whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day the precepts, the sciences,
the dialogue, the traditional myths and legends, and the Nârâ*s*a*m*sî
Gâthâs, for his lesson, satisfies the gods with honey-offerings; and,
being satisfied, they satisfy him by (granting him) security of
possession, by life-breath, by seed, by his whole self, and by all
auspicious blessings; and rivers of ghee and rivers of honey flow for
his Fathers, as their accustomed draughts.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:6:9">11:5:6:9</span></span>9. Now,
for this, sacrifice to the Brahman there are four Vasha*t*-calls <span
id="fr_319"></span>[1](#fn_319),--to wit, when the wind blows, when it
lightens, when it thunders, and when it rumbles <span
id="fr_320"></span>[2](#fn_320) whence he who knows this should
certainly study <span id="fr_321"></span>[3](#fn_321) when the wind is
blowing, and when it lightens, or thunders, or rumbles, so as not to
lose his Vasha*t*-calls; and verily he is freed from recurring death,
and attains to community of nature (or, being) with the Brahman. And
should he be altogether unable (to study), let him at least read a
single divine word; and thus he is not shut out from beings <span
id="fr_322"></span>[4](#fn_322).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_310"></span>[95:3](sbe44030.htm#fr_310) Or perhaps, from a
cupful of water onwards,--aharahar dadyâd <span id="page_96">p.
96</span> iti manushyân uddi*s*ya odapâtrât udakapûritam pâtram
udapâtram udakapâtrâvadhi yad odanâdika*m* dadyât sa manushyaya*gñ*a ity
artha*h*, Sây.--Cf. J. Muir, Orig. Sanskrit Texts, vol. iii, p. 18 seqq.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[96:1](sbe44030.htm#fr_311) In making offering
to the (three immediately preceding) departed ancestors, water is poured
our for them (to wash themselves with) both at the beginning and at the
end of the ceremony; see II, 4, 2, 16; 23; II, 6, 1, 34; 41, where each
time it is said that this is done 'even as one would pour out water for
(a guest) who is to take (or has taken) food with him;'--pit*rî*n
uddi*s*ya pratyaha*m* svadhâkâre*n*a annâdikam udapâtraparyanta*m*
dadyât, Sây.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[96:2](sbe44030.htm#fr_312) Apparently the log
of wood placed on the Gârhapatya after the completion of the offering.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[97:1](sbe44030.htm#fr_313) Aprâptasya phalasya
prâptir yoga*h* tasya paripâlana*m* kshema*h*, Sây.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[98:1](sbe44030.htm#fr_314) The Anu*s*âsanâni,
according to Sâya*n*a, are the six Vedâṅgas, or rules of grammar,
etymology, &c.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[98:2](sbe44030.htm#fr_315) By vidyâ*h*,
according to Sâya*n*a, the philosophical systems, Nyâya, Mîmâ*m*sa, &c.,
are to be understood. More likely, however, such special sciences as the
'sarpavidyâ' (science of snakes) are referred to; cf. [XIII, 4, 3,
9](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:9) seqq.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[98:3](sbe44030.htm#fr_316) Vâkovâkyam,
apparently some special theological discourse, or discourses, similar to
(if not identical with) the numerous Brahmodya, or disputations on
spiritual matters. As an example of such a dialogue, Sâya*n*a refers to
the dialogue between Uddâlaka Âru*n*i and Svaidâya*n*a Gautama, [XI, 4,
1, 4](sbe44021.htm#11:4:1:4) seqq.

<span id="fn_317"></span>[98:4](sbe44030.htm#fr_317) Itihâsa-purâ*n*a:
the Itihâsa, according to Sâya*n*a, are cosmological myths or accounts,
such as 'In the beginning this universe was nothing but water,' &c.;
whilst as an instance of the Purâ*n*a (stories of olden times,
purâtanapurushav*ri*ttânta) he refers to the story of Purûravas and
Urva*s*î. Cf. Max Müller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 40.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[98:5](sbe44030.htm#fr_318) Or, the Gâthâs and
Nârâ*s*a*m*sîs. Sâya*n*a, in the first place, takes the two as one,
meaning 'stanzas (or verses) telling about men;' but he then refers to
the interpretation by others, according to which the Gâthâs are such
verses as that about 'the great snake driven from the lake' ([XI, 5, 5,
8](sbe44029.htm#11:5:5:8)); whilst the Nârâ*s*a*m*sîs would be (verses
'telling about men') such as that regarding *G*aname*g*aya and his
horses ([XI, 5, 5, 12](sbe44029.htm#11:5:5:12)). On Aitareyâr. II, 3, 6,
8, Sâya*n*a quotes 'prâta*h* prâtar an*ri*ta*m* to vadanti' as an
instance of a Gâthâ.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[99:1](sbe44030.htm#fr_319) That is, the call
'Vausha*t*!' with which, at the end of the offering-formula, the
oblation is poured into the fire.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[99:2](sbe44030.htm#fr_320) That is, when the
rumbling of distant thunder is heard; or, perhaps, when there is a
rattling sound, as from hail-stones.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[99:3](sbe44030.htm#fr_321) Hardly, should only
study,--adhîyîtaiva.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[99:4](sbe44030.htm#fr_322) Or, from (the world
of) spirits (?).
