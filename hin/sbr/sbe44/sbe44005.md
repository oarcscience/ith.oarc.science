### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:3:1">11:1:3:1</span></span>1. When
he has performed the Full-moon sacrifice, he prepares an additional
(cake) for Indra Vim*ri*dh (the repeller of scorners), and offers it in
accordance with the procedure of an ish*t*i <span
id="fr_86"></span>[2](#fn_86); and when he has performed the New-moon
sacrifice, he prepares an additional rice-pap for Aditi <span
id="fr_87"></span>[3](#fn_87), and offers it in accordance with the
procedure of an ish*t*i.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:3:2">11:1:3:2</span></span>2. And
as to why, after performing the Full-moon sacrifice, he prepares (a
cake) for Indra Vim*ri*dh, it is because Indra is the deity of the
sacrifice; but the chief oblation of the Full-moon sacrifice belongs to
Agni and Soma, and nothing is offered there with the formula 'To Indra
(I offer) thee!' Hereby then that oblation comes to be shared by Indra,
and so does the sacrifice come to be shared by Indra. And as to why (he
offers) with 'To (Indra) Vim*ri*dh!' it is that by the Full-moon
sacrifice he slays all scorners (m*ri*dh), all evil spirits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:3:3">11:1:3:3</span></span>3. And
as to why, after performing the New-moon sacrifice, he prepares a pap
for Aditi,--that moon doubtless is the same as King Soma, the food of
the gods: when on that night he is not seen either in the east or in the
west, the oblation becomes, as it were, uncertain and unfirm. Now Aditi
is this earth, and she, indeed, is certain and firmly established:
thereby, then, that oblation of his becomes certain and firmly
established. Such, then, is the reason why he prepares additional
oblations; now as to why he should not prepare them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:3:4">11:1:3:4</span></span>4.
When, after performing the Full-moon sacrifice, he prepares an
additional (cake) for Indra Vim*ri*dh, he does so in order that his
sacrifice should become shared in by Indra, for every sacrifice belongs
to Indra. But inasmuch as every sacrifice belongs to Indra, thereby that
oblation of his, and that sacrifice, is already shared in by Indra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:3:5">11:1:3:5</span></span>5. And
when, after performing the New-moon sacrifice, he prepares an additional
pap for Aditi,--surely the New-moon sacrifice is itself an additional
one; for by the Full-moon sacrifice Indra slew V*ri*tra, and for him who
had slain V*ri*tra, the gods

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

then prepared that additional oblation, the New-moon sacrifice: why,
then, should he prepare an oblation to be added to an additional
offering? Let him, therefore, not prepare the additional oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:3:6">11:1:3:6</span></span>6.
When, after performing the Full-moon sacrifice, he afterwards prepares
another oblation; and when, after performing the New-moon sacrifice, he
afterwards prepares another oblation, he rises and defies his malicious
enemy; and, indeed, unassailed and undisturbed is the prosperity of him
who at full moon performs the Full-moon sacrifice, and at new moon the
New-moon sacrifice <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:3:7">11:1:3:7</span></span>7. For
by performing the Full-moon sacrifice at full moon, and the New-moon
sacrifice at new moon, the gods forthwith dispelled evil, and were
forthwith reproduced; and, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the
Full-moon sacrifice at full moon, and the New-moon sacrifice at new
moon, forthwith dispels evil, and is forthwith reproduced. If he offer
an additional oblation, let him give a sacrificial fee (to the priests);
for no oblation, they say, should be without a dakshi*n*â; and for the
Full and New-moon sacrifices there is that dakshi*n*â, to wit, the
Anvâhârya (mess of rice <span id="fr_89"></span>[2](#fn_89)). Thus much
as to the additional oblations; now as to (the sun) rising over him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_86"></span>[5:2](sbe44005.htm#fr_86) That is to say, after
the model of the Full-moon sacrifice.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[5:3](sbe44005.htm#fr_87) See part i, p. 375,
where read 'Aditi' for 'Âditye.'

<span id="fn_88"></span>[7:1](sbe44005.htm#fr_88) That is, he who
performs these sacrifices without additional oblations:--ata*h*
paur*n*amâsyâyâm amâvâsyâ*m* *k*a dar*s*apûr*n*amâsayâgâv eva kartavyau,
nânyat ki*mk*id dhavir anunitvâpyam, Sây. Whilst favouring this view,
the author, however, also admits the other as ensuring the same
benefits.
