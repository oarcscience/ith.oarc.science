### SEVENTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE INITIATION OF THE SACRIFICER.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:7:1">13:1:7:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati desired, 'Might I perform a horse-sacrifice <span
id="fr_730"></span>[1](#fn_726.md)?' He toiled and practised fervid
devotion. From the body of him, when wearied and heated, the deities
departed in a sevenfold way: therefrom the Dîkshâ (initiation) was
produced. He perceived those Vai*s*vadeva <span
id="fr_731"></span>[2](#fn_727) (oblations.md). He offered

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

them, and by means of them he gained the Dîkshâ: and when the Sacrificer
offers the Vai*s*vadeva (oblations) it is the Dîkshâ he thereby gains.
Day after day he offers them: day after day he thus gains the
Dîkshâ <span id="fr_732"></span>[1](#fn_728.md). Seven of them he offers;
for seven were those deities that departed (from Pra*g*âpati); it is by
means of them that he (the priest) gains the Dîkshâ for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:7:2">13:1:7:2</span></span>2. But,
indeed, the vital airs depart from those who exceed (the duration of)
the Dîkshâ. For

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

seven days they observe it; for there are seven (outlets of) vital airs
in the head, and the Dîkshâ is the vital airs: it is by means of the
vital airs he gains the Dîkshâ, the vital airs, for him. He makes
offering by dividing (each) deity into three parts <span
id="fr_733"></span>[1](#fn_729.md); for the gods are of three orders <span
id="fr_734"></span>[2](#fn_730.md), and of three orders are these worlds:
he thus establishes himself in these worlds in prosperity and vital
power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:7:3">13:1:7:3</span></span>3. They
amount to one and twenty (single invocations and oblations),--there are
twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as the
twenty-first,--that is the divine ruling-power, that is the glory: that
supreme lordship, that summit of the fallow one (the Sun), that realm of
light he attains.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:7:4">13:1:7:4</span></span>4.
Thirty Audgrabha*n*as <span id="fr_735"></span>[3](#fn_731.md) he
offers,--of thirty syllables the Virâ*g* (metre) consists, and the
Virâ*g* means all food: thus (he offers) for the obtainment of all food.
Four Audgrabha*n*as he offers (on each day), and three
Vai*s*vadevas;--they amount to seven; for there are seven vital airs of
the head, and the Dîkshâ is the vital airs: by means of the vital airs
he thus gains the Dîkshâ, the vital airs,

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

for him. A full (-spoon)-oblation <span id="fr_736"></span>[1](#fn_732.md)
he offers last for the sake of invigoration and union.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_726"></span>[289:1](sbe44080.htm#fr_730.md) Or, 'might I make
offering with the life-sap of the horse?' the natural, as well as the
technical, meaning of the term 'a*s*vamedha' being generally understood
in these speculations.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[289:2](sbe44080.htm#fr_731.md) The oblations
offered prior to the initiation--here, as at any Soma-sacrifice--are
called Audgrabha*n*a (elevatory) oblations. On the present occasion he,
in the first place, performs, on each of the first six days of the
Dîkshâ, the four oblations of this kind offered at the ordinary
Soma-sacrifice (for which see III, 1, 4, 1 seqq.); whilst on the seventh
day he offers, instead of these, the six corresponding oblations of the
Agni*k*ayana (which forms a necessary element of the A*s*vamedha), see
VI, 6, 1, 15-20; for a further and final oblation offered on all these
occasions, see [p. 292](#page_292), note [1](#fn_732.md). He then performs
on each day three additional oblations <span id="page_290">p. 290</span>
(increased to four on the last day) which are peculiar to the
A*s*vamedha, and vary from day to day in respect of the deities to whom
they are offered. But whilst, in the *S*rautasûtras, these special
oblations are likewise called Audgrabha*n*a (Katy. XX, 4, 2-10), the
author here applies to them the term Vai*s*vadeva, owing apparently to
the fact of their being offered, not to the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* properly
speaking, but to different deities. In the dogmatic explanation of the
Audgrabha*n*as of the ordinary sacrifice, reference was also made (at
III, 1, 4, 9) to the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*, but only incidentally. Harisvâmin,
indeed, points out that the designation Vai*s*vadeva refers in the first
place to the invocations (Vâ*g*. S. XXII, 20) used with these special
oblations (as is, indeed, evident from [paragraph
2](sbe44080.htm#13:1:7:2); cf. also part ii, p. 20, note 1.md); and the
total of seven applied to them does not therefore refer here (as it does
in [paragraph 4](sbe44080.htm#13:1:7:4).md) to the four ordinary and the
three special Audgrabha*n*a oblations, but to the series of dedicatory
formulas relating to the latter oblations, as explained [p.
291](#page_291), note [1](#fn_729.md); and, of course, by implication, to
the oblations themselves.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[290:1](sbe44080.htm#fr_732.md) Though the
Initiation only becomes perfect by the Sacrificer being girded with a
hempen zone, whilst kneeling on a double black-antelope skin, and by a
staff being handed to him (III, 2, 1, 1-32); on the present occasion,
the Sacrificer is on each day, after the performance of the
Audgrabha*n*a oblations, at least to sit down on the antelope skin;
whilst on the seventh and last day of the Dîksha*n*îyesh*t*i, the
remaining ceremonies take place, after which those of the Agni*k*ayana,
viz. the placing of the Ukhâ, or fire-pan, on the fire and the putting
of thirteen fire-sticks in the pan (VI, 6, 2, 1 seqq.), &c.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[291:1](sbe44080.htm#fr_733.md) The ka*nd*ikâ
XXII, 20 is made up of seven parts, each of which consists of three
distinct invocations addressed to the same deity; the seven deities
addressed in the whole formula being Ka, Pra*g*âpati, Aditi, Sarasvatî,
Pûshan, Tvash*tri*, and Vish*n*u; whilst the three invocations to Ka,
for instance, are 'Kâya svâhâ! Kasmai svâhâ! Katamasmai svâhâ!' Cf.
[XIII, 1, 8, 2](sbe44081.htm#13:1:8:2.md) seqq.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[291:2](sbe44080.htm#fr_734.md) Viz. either the
Vasus, Rudras, and Âdityas (cf. IV, 5, 7, 2); or those of the sky, the
air, and the earth, headed by Sûrya, Vâyu, and Agni respectively.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[291:3](sbe44080.htm#fr_735.md) That is, the four
Audgrabha*n*as of the ordinary Soma-sacrifice offered on each of the
seven days of the Dîkshâ, and two more added thereto on the seventh day.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[292:1](sbe44080.htm#fr_736.md) For a full
discussion of this final Audgrabha*n*a oblation, the only one, it would
seem, offered with the regular offering-spoon (*g*uhû) filled by means
of the dipping-spoon (sruva), see III, 1, 4, 2; 16-23; cf. also VI, 6,
1, 21.
