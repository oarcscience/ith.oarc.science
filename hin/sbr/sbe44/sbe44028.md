### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE UPANAYANA, OR INITIATION OF THE BRÂHMA*N*ICAL STUDENT <span id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_283.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:1">11:5:4:1</span></span>1. He
says, 'I have come for Brahma*k*arya <span
id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_284.md):' he thereby reports himself to the
Brahman. He says, 'Let me be a Brahma*k*ârin (student):' he thereby
makes himself over to the Brahman. He (the teacher) then says, 'What
(ka) is thy name?'--now Ka is Pra*g*âpati: he thus initiates him after
making him one belonging to Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:2">11:5:4:2</span></span>2. He
then takes his (right) hand with, 'Indra's disciple thou art; Agni is
thy teacher, I am thy teacher, O N.N.!'--now these are two most high and
most powerful deities: it is to these two most high and most powerful
deities he commits him; and thus his disciple suffers no harm of any
kind, nor does he who knows this <span id="fr_285"></span>[3](#fn_285.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:3">11:5:4:3</span></span>3. He
then commits him to the beings:--'To Pra*g*âpati I commit thee, to the
god Savit*ri* I commit thee;'--now these are two most high and most
important deities: it is to these two most high and most important
deities he commits him; and thus his disciple suffers no harm of any
kind, nor does he who knows this.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:4">11:5:4:4</span></span>4. 'To
the waters, to the plants I commit thee,'--he thus commits him to the
waters and plants.--'To Heaven and Earth I commit thee,'--he thus
commits him to these two, heaven and earth, within which all this
universe is contained.--'To all beings I commit thee for security from
injury,'--he thus commits him to all beings for security from injury;
and thus his disciple suffers no harm of any kind, nor does he who knows
this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:5">11:5:4:5</span></span>5.
'Thou art a Brahma*k*ârin,' he says, and thus commits him to the
Brahman;--'sip water!'--water, doubtless, means ambrosia: 'sip ambrosia'
is thus what he tells him;--'do thy work!'--work, doubtless, means
vigour: 'exert vigour' is thus what he tells him;--'put on
fuel!'--'enkindle thy mind with fire, with holy lustre!' is what he
thereby tells him;--'do not sleep <span
id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_286.md)!'--'do not die' is what he thereby says
to him;--'sip water!'--water means ambrosia: 'sip ambrosia' is what he
thus tells him. He thus encloses him on both sides with ambrosia (the
drink of immortality), and thus the Brahma*k*ârin suffers no harm of any
kind, nor does he who knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:6">11:5:4:6</span></span>6. He
then recites to him (teaches him) the Sâvitrî <span
id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_287.md);--formerly, indeed, they taught this
(verse) at the end of a year <span id="fr_288"></span>[3](#fn_288.md),
thinking, 'Children, indeed, are

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

born after being fashioned for a year <span
id="fr_289"></span>[1](#fn_289): thus we lay speech (voice.md) into this
one as soon as he has been born.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:7">11:5:4:7</span></span>7. Or
after six months, thinking, 'There are six seasons in the year, and
children are born after being fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech
into this one as soon as he has been born.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:8">11:5:4:8</span></span>8. Or
after twenty-four days, thinking, 'There are twenty-four half-months in
the year, and children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay
speech into this one as soon as he has been born.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:9">11:5:4:9</span></span>9. Or
after twelve days, thinking, 'There are twelve months in the year, and
children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into
this one as soon as he has been born.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:10">11:5:4:10</span></span>10.
Or after six days, thinking, 'There are six seasons in the year, and
children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into
this one as soon as he has been born.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:11">11:5:4:11</span></span>11.
Or after three days, thinking, 'There are three seasons in the year, and
children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into
this one as soon as he has been born.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:12">11:5:4:12</span></span>12.
Concerning this they also sing the verse,--'By laying his right hand on
(the pupil), the teacher becomes pregnant (with him): in the third
(night) he is born as a Brâhma*n*a with the Sâvitrî <span
id="fr_290"></span>[2](#fn_290.md).' Let him,

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

however, teach a Brâhma*n*a (the Sâvitrî) at once, for the Brâhma*n*a
belongs to Agni, and Agni is born at once <span
id="fr_291"></span>[1](#fn_291.md): therefore, he should teach the
Brâhma*n*a at once.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:13">11:5:4:13</span></span>13.
Now some teach an Anush*t*ubh Sâvitrî, saying, 'The Anush*t*ubh is
speech: we thus lay speech into him.' But let him not do so; for if, in
that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (student) has taken
away his (the teacher's) speech: he will become dumb;' then that would
indeed be likely to come to pass: let him therefore teach him that
Gâyatrî Sâvitrî.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:14">11:5:4:14</span></span>14.
And some recite it to him while he (the student) is standing or sitting
on (the teacher's) right side; but let him not do this; for if, in that
case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (teacher) has born this
(student) sideways, he will become averse to him;' then that would
indeed be likely to come to pass: let him therefore recite it in a
forward (easterly) direction to (the student) looking at him towards the
west.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:15">11:5:4:15</span></span>15.
He (first) recites it by pâdas <span id="fr_292"></span>[2](#fn_292.md):
there being three breathings, the out-breathing, the up-breathing and
the through-breathing; it is these he thus lays into him;--then by
half-verses: there being these

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

two (principal) breathings, the out-breathing and the up-breathing <span
id="fr_293"></span>[1](#fn_293.md), it is the out-breathing and the
up-breathing he thus lays into him;--then the whole (verse): there being
this one vital air (in man), he thus lays the whole vital air into the
whole of him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:16">11:5:4:16</span></span>16.
As to this they say, 'When one has admitted a Brâhma*n*a to a term of
studentship, he should not carry on sexual intercourse, lest he should
generate this Brâhma*n*a from shed seed; for, indeed, he who enters on a
term of studentship becomes an embryo.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:17">11:5:4:17</span></span>17.
And concerning this they also say, 'He may nevertheless do so, if he
chooses; for these creatures are of two kinds, divine and human,--these
human creatures are born from the womb, and the divine creatures, being
the metres (verses of scripture), are born from the month: it is
therefrom he (the teacher) produces him, and therefore he may do so
(have intercourse) if he chooses.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:4:18">11:5:4:18</span></span>18.
And they also say, 'He who is a Brahma*k*ârin should not eat honey, lest
he should reach the end of food, for honey, doubtless, is the utmost
(supreme) essence of plants.' But *S*vetaketu Âru*n*eya, when eating
honey, whilst he was a student, said, 'This honey, in truth, is the
remainder (essential part) of the triple science (the Vedas), and he,
indeed, who has such a remainder, is an essence.' And, indeed, if a
Brahma*k*ârin, knowing this, eats honey, it is just as if he were to
utter either a *Ri*k-verse, or Ya*g*us-formula, or a Sâman-tune: let him
therefore eat freely of it.

religious (theological) studentship: 'I have come to be a
student.'--Sâya*n*a takes the aorist 'âgâm' in an optative sense 'may I
enter (or obtain),'--brahma*k*âri*n*o bhâvo brahma*k*arya*m* tad âgâ*m*
prâpnuyâm.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[87:3](sbe44028.htm#fr_288.md) Sâya*n*a takes this
in the sense of 'some only teach this (formula) a year after (or, after
the first year),'--purâ pûrvasminn upanayanâd ûrdhvabhâvini
sa*m*vatsarakâle<sup>ऽ</sup>tî*t*e sati tam etâ*m* gâyatrim anvâhu*h*,

<span id="fn_289"></span>[88:1](sbe44028.htm#fr_289.md) Literally, made
equal, or corresponding, to a year,--Sa*m*vatsarâtmanâ kâlena

<span id="fn_291"></span>[89:1](sbe44028.htm#fr_291.md) Viz. immediately on
the 'churning-sticks' being set in motion.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[89:2](sbe44028.htm#fr_292.md) The Gâyatrî
(Sâvitrî) consists of three octosyllabic pâdas, forming two half-verses
of two and one pâda respectively; whilst an Anush*t*ubh (Sâvitrî) would
consist of four octosyllabic pâdas, two of which make a half-verse.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[90:1](sbe44028.htm#fr_293.md) That is, the breath
of the mouth, and that of the nostrils.
