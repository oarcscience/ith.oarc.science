<p>when they enter on the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya Atir&acirc;tra it is just as if they were entering the ocean by a flight of steps.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:2:1:2">12:2:1:2</A></FONT></span>2.

The Abhiplava is (a spot) suitable for swimming; and so is the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya suitable for swimming.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:2:1:3">12:2:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. The Abhi<I>g</I>it is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as (where the water reaches) either to the arm-pits, or to the neck, whence, having rested, they come out (of the water). The first Svaras&acirc;man is thigh-deep, the second knee-deep, the third knuckle-deep. The Vishuvat is a foothold (in the form of) an island. The first (Svaras&acirc;man) with reversed S&acirc;mans is knuckle-deep, the second knee-deep, and the third thigh-deep.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:2:1:4">12:2:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. The Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as (where the water reaches) either to the arm-pits or to the neck, whence, having rested, he enters (the deep water again). The P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya is suitable for swimming, and so is the Abhiplava, and so are the Go and &Acirc;yus, and so is the Da<I>s</I>ar&acirc;tra.</p>

<p>they step out (of the water). The Udayan&icirc;ya (concluding) Atir&acirc;tra is a flight of steps, for it is by a flight of steps that people step out (of the water): thus, when they perform the Udayan&icirc;ya Atir&acirc;tra, it is just as if, having entered the sea by a flight of steps, they were to step out of it, by a flight of steps.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:2:1:6">12:2:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. Regarding this they say, 'How many Atir&acirc;tras are there in the year, how many Agnish<I>t</I>omas, how many Ukthyas, how many Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>ins, how many Sha<I>d</I>ahas?'--Two Atir&acirc;tras, a hundred and six Agnish<I>t</I>omas, and two hundred and forty Ukthyas,--thus in the case of those who perform the Svaras&acirc;mans as Ukthyas.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:2:1:7">12:2:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. But in the case of those who perform them as Agnish<I>t</I>omas, a hundred and twelve Agnish<I>t</I>omas, two hundred and thirty-four Ukthyas, twelve Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>ins, and sixty Sha<I>d</I>ahas. This, then, is how the year is obtained.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:2:1:8">12:2:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. There are twelve months in the year, and their vital energy and power are the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>as; and by performing the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>as month by month, they obtain, in monthly portions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_443"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, that vital energy of the year.--'And how do they obtain the vital energy of the thirteenth (intercalary) month?' Well, subsequent to the Vishuvat day they perform the Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it Agnish<I>t</I>oma with all the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_444"></A><A HREF="#fn_444"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and thus indeed they obtain the vital energy of the thirteenth month.</p>

<p>knowing this, once said, 'I am now going to get myself initiated for one year.' His father, looking at him, said, 'Knowest thou, long-lived one, the fording-footholds of the year?'--'I know them,' he replied, for, indeed, he said this as one knowing it.</p>
