### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:2:1">13:8:2:1</span></span>1. Now,
some bank up (the sepulchral mound) after covering up (the site). The
gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, were
contending for (the possession of) this (terrestrial) world. The gods
drove out the Asuras, their rivals and enemies, from this world; whence
those who

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

are godly people make their sepulchres so as not to be separate (from
the earth), whilst those (people) who are of the Asura nature, the
Easterns and others, (make their sepulchral mounds) so as to be
separated (from the earth), either on a basin <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[1](#fn_1139.md) or on some such thing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:2:2">13:8:2:2</span></span>2. He
then encloses it by means of enclosing-stones: what those
enclosing-stones (round the fire-hearths) are, that they are here <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[2](#fn_1140.md). With a formula he sets up those,
silently these: he thus keeps separate what refers to the gods and what
refers to the Fathers. With (an) undefined (number of stones he encloses
it), for undefined is yonder world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:2:3">13:8:2:3</span></span>3. He
then sweeps that (site) with a palâ*s*a (Butea frondosa) branch--what
the sweeping (signified) on that occasion <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[3](#fn_1141), that (it does.md) here--with (Vâ*g*. S.
XXXV, I), 'Let the niggards avaunt from hence, the perverse scorners of
the gods!'--he thereby expels from this world the niggards, the perverse
haters of the gods, the Asura-Rakshas;--'it is the place of this
Soma-offerer,' for he who has performed a Soma-sacrifice is a
Soma-offerer;--'(an abode) distinguished by lights, by days, by
nights,'--he thereby makes him to

<span id="page_431">p. 431</span>

be of the world of the seasons, the days and nights;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:2:4">13:8:2:4</span></span>4. 'May
Yama grant him an abode;'--for Yama has power over the abode in this
(earth), and it is him he solicits for an abode therein for this (dead
man). He throws out this (branch) to the right (south), the other <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1](#fn_1142) to the left (north.md) side: he thus
keeps the divine separate from what belongs to the Fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:2:5">13:8:2:5</span></span>5. He
(the Adhvaryu) then yokes (the team) to the plough on the south
side,--some say on the north side: he may do as he chooses. Having given
the order, saying, 'Yoke!' he (the Sacrificer) utters the formula
(Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 2), 'May Savit*ri* vouchsafe for thy bones a place in
the earth!'--Savit*ri* now indeed vouchsafes a place in the earth for
his (the deceased man's) bones;--'Let the oxen be yoked therefore!' for
it is indeed for this work that the oxen are yoked.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:2:6">13:8:2:6</span></span>6. It
is (a team) of six oxen,--six seasons are a year: on the seasons, on the
year, as a firm foundation, he thus establishes him. Having turned round
(the plough) from right to left <span id="fr_1151"></span>[2](#fn_1143.md),
he ploughs the first furrow with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 3), 'May Vâyu purify!'
along the north side (along the cord) towards the west <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[3](#fn_1144.md); with, 'May

<span id="page_432">p. 432</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Savit*ri* purify!'
along the west side towards the south; with, 'With Agni's lustre!' along
the south side towards the east; with, 'With Sûrya's brilliance!' along
the front side towards the north.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:2:7">13:8:2:7</span></span>7. Four
furrows he ploughs with a formula: he thereby establishes him in
whatever food there is in the four quarters. And (as to why it is done)
with a formula,--certain, assuredly, is the sacrificial formula
(ya*g*us), and certain are these quarters.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:2:8">13:8:2:8</span></span>8. He
then ploughs across the body (of the sepulchral site)--he thereby
establishes him in whatever food there is in the year <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[1](#fn_1145)--silently with (an.md) undefined (number
of furrows), for undefined is yonder world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:2:9">13:8:2:9</span></span>9.
Having performed the work for which he has put the team to that
(plough), he now unfastens it: 'Let the oxen be unyoked!' he says, for
it is for that work that the oxen were yoked. To the right (south)
side <span id="fr_1154"></span>[2](#fn_1146.md) he removes this (plough and
team), to the left (side) arty other: he thus keeps the divine separate
from what' belongs to the Fathers.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1139"></span>[430:1](sbe44114.htm#fr_1147.md) I take the
'*k*amû' to be a shallow stone basin or trough, either solid or
consisting of masonry (bricks) in the manner of our stone-lined graves.

<span id="fn_1140"></span>[430:2](sbe44114.htm#fr_1148.md) Cf. VII, 1, 1,
12 seq. 'The enclosing-stones are the womb: he thus encloses the seed
here sown in a womb. . . And, again, the Gârhapatya hearth is this
(terrestrial) world, and the enclosing-stones are the waters: he thus
surrounds this world with water.'

<span id="fn_1141"></span>[430:3](sbe44114.htm#fr_1149.md) Viz. in building
the Gârhapatya hearth (VII, 1, 1, 11 seqq.); no such sweeping taking
place in preparing the site for the Âhavanîya (VII, 3, 1, 7).

<span id="fn_1142"></span>[431:1](sbe44114.htm#fr_1150.md) Viz. that used
in sweeping the Gârhapatya, VII, 7, 1, 5.

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[431:2](sbe44114.htm#fr_1151.md) That is, having
driven the plough round from the south side to the north, in the
non-sunwise direction (i.e. keeping the sepulchral site on the left hand
side).

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[431:3](sbe44114.htm#fr_1152.md) In ploughing the
site of the fire-altar, the first furrow was drawn along the south side
from west to east; and then, in sunwise fashion, from the south-west
corner round along the west, north, and east sides; see VII, 2, 2, 9
seqq.

<span id="fn_1145"></span>[432:1](sbe44114.htm#fr_1153.md) The Sacrificer's
body (trunk) or self, like that of Pra*g*âpati, is as usual identified
with the year (Father Time).

<span id="fn_1146"></span>[432:2](sbe44114.htm#fr_1154.md) Or rather to the
south-west side, whilst at the Agni*k*ayana (VII, 2, 2, 21) it was done
towards the north-east.
