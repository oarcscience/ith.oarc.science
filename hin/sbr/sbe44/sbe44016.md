### SIXTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:1">11:2:6:1</span></span>1. The
Pra*n*îtâ water, doubtless, is the head of the sacrifice <span
id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151.md); and when he leads forward the Pra*n*îtâ
water, it is the head of the sacrifice he thereby forms, and he should
know that it is that head of his own that is then being formed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:2">11:2:6:2</span></span>2. The
fuel, indeed, is its breath (of the mouth), for it is by the breath that
everything here is kindled (animated) that has breath and moves
twinkling with its eyelids: let him know that it is he himself that is
that fuel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:3">11:2:6:3</span></span>3. The
kindling-verses, indeed, are its spine: let him therefore say (to the
Hot*ri*.) regarding them, 'Recite for me, making them, as it were,
continuous <span id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_152.md);' for continuous, as it
were, is this spinal column. And the two libations of ghee are its mind
and speech, Sarasvat and Sarasvatî <span
id="fr_153"></span>[3](#fn_153.md): let

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

him know that the two libations of ghee are his mind and speech,
Sarasvat and Sarasvatî.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:4">11:2:6:4</span></span>4. The
five fore-offerings are these its five (outlets of the) vital airs in
the head;--the first fore-offering is its mouth, the second the right
nostril, the third the left nostril, the fourth the right ear, and the
fifth the left ear. And inasmuch as at the fourth fore-offering he pours
together (the ghee <span id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_154).md), therefore
this ear is, on the inner side, connected by a channel (with the other).
The two butter-portions are the eyes: let him know that these are his
own eyes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:5">11:2:6:5</span></span>5. And
that cake which is offered to Agni is its right flank; and the
low-voiced offering is its heart; and inasmuch as they perform this in a
low voice, this heart is, as it were, in secret.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:6">11:2:6:6</span></span>6. And
that cake which is offered to Agni and Soma (at full moon), or Indra's
Sânnâyya (at new moon), is its left flank; the Svish*t*ak*ri*t is that
part between its shoulders; and the (Brahman's) fore-portion <span
id="fr_155"></span>[2](#fn_155.md) is the poison <span
id="fr_156"></span>[3](#fn_156.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:7">11:2:6:7</span></span>7. And
when he cuts off the fore-portion,---even as there they cut out what was
injured <span id="fr_157"></span>[4](#fn_157.md) in Pra*g*âpati, so do they
now thereby cut out what in this (body) is clogged and hardened, and
affected by Varu*n*a

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

let him know that, as there they cut out what was injured in
Pra*g*âpati, so they now cut out what in him is clogged and hardened and
affected by Varu*n*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:8">11:2:6:8</span></span>8. The
I*d*â, indeed, is the belly: even as there, at (the invocation of) the
I*d*â <span id="fr_158"></span>[1](#fn_158.md) they cut off portions (and
put them) together, so now food, of all kinds is put together in the
belly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:9">11:2:6:9</span></span>9. The
three after-offerings are these its three downward breathings; and the
Sûktavâka and *S*amyorvâka its arms (or fore-feet); the four
Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as the four supports--the two thighs and the two
knee-bones; and the Samish*t*aya*g*us is the two (hind) feet.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:10">11:2:6:10</span></span>10.
These are twenty-one offerings;--two libations of ghee, five
fore-offerings, two butter-portions, and Agni's cake: this makes ten;
Agni and Soma's low-voiced offering, Agni and Soma's cake, the Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t, the I*d*â, three after-offerings, the Sûktavâka, the
*S*amyorvâka, further his seizing (the two spoons) at the same time
there at the Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as <span id="fr_159"></span>[2](#fn_159.md) and
(last) the Samish*t*aya*g*us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:11">11:2:6:11</span></span>11.
These are twenty-one offerings,--there are twelve months and five
seasons in a year; and three worlds--that makes twenty; and yonder
burning (sun) is the twenty-first--that is the goal <span
id="fr_160"></span>[3](#fn_160.md), that the resting-place: he thus reaches
that goal, that resting-place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:12">11:2:6:12</span></span>12.
Now, as to this Âru*n*i said, 'Every half-month, indeed, I become a
sharer of the same world with yonder sun: that is the perfection of the
Full and New-moon sacrifices which I know.'

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:13">11:2:6:13</span></span>13.
As to this they ask, 'Who is the better one, the self-offerer, or the
god-offerer?' Let him say, 'The self-offerer;' for a self-offerer,
doubtless, is he who knows, 'This my (new) body is formed by that (body
of Ya*gñ*a, the sacrifice), this my (new) body is procured <span
id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_161.md) thereby.' And even as a snake frees
itself from its skin, so does he free himself from his mortal body, from
sin; and made up of the *Rik*, the Ya*g*us, the Sâman, and of offerings,
does he pass on to the heavenly world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:6:14">11:2:6:14</span></span>14.
And a god-offerer, doubtless, is he who knows, 'I am now offering
sacrifice to the gods, I am serving the gods,'--such a one is like an
inferior who brings tribute to his superior, or like a man of the people
who brings tribute to the king: verily, he does not win such a place (in
heaven) as the other.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_151"></span>[35:1](sbe44016.htm#fr_151.md) Ya*gñ*a, the
sacrifice, is here, as so often, to be understood as the abstract
representation of the victim (here the horse), as well as of the
Purusha,--i.e. Pra*g*âpati, and the Sacrificer.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[35:2](sbe44016.htm#fr_152.md) The
kindling-verses, being in the Gâyatrî metre, consist of three
octosyllabic pâdas each. Whilst after each verse a kindling-stick
(samidh) is thrown into the fire by the Adhvaryu, the Hot*ri* does not
make any pause in his recitation at this point, but he does so after the
second pâda of each verse, thus connecting the last pâda with the first
two pâdas of the next verse.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[35:3](sbe44016.htm#fr_153.md) See XI, 2, 5, 9
(There doesn't appear to be such a paragraph--JBH).

<span id="fn_154"></span>[36:1](sbe44016.htm#fr_154.md) See I, 5, 3, 16.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[36:2](sbe44016.htm#fr_155.md) See I, 7, 4, 10
seqq.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[36:3](sbe44016.htm#fr_156.md) Instead of
'visham,' the MS. of Sâya*n*a's commentary reads 'dvishan' (hater,
enemy), which is explained as meaning '*s*atrubuddhi'; the cutting out'
of the fore-portion being compared with the annihilation of enemies
(*s*atrunirasanârtham),--all this is, however, manifestly fanciful. What
is intended would seem to be the poison (real or figurative) caused by
the enemies’ (or Rudra's, or Varu*n*a's) shafts, in accordance with the
myth regarding Pra*g*âpati and his daughter, I, 7, 4, 1 seqq.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[36:4](sbe44016.htm#fr_157.md) Literally, what was
pierced (by an arrow), cf. I, 7, 4, 3. 9.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[37:1](sbe44016.htm#fr_158.md) See I, 8, 1, 12
seqq.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[37:2](sbe44016.htm#fr_159.md) See I, 9, 2, 19.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[37:3](sbe44016.htm#fr_160.md) Saishâ sûryarûpaiva
gati*h* gantavyabhûmi*h*; eshaiva pratish*th*â
k*ri*tsnaphalasyâ*s*raya*h*, Sây.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[38:1](sbe44016.htm#fr_161.md) Upadhîyate
upasthâpyate, Sây.
