### SEVENTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE SARVAMEDHA, OR ALL-SACRIFICE.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:1">13:7:1:1</span></span>1.
Brahman Svayambhu (the self-existent, n.) was performing
austerities <span id="fr_1107"></span>[3](#fn_1100). He said this
much,--

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Verily, there is
no perpetuity in austerities; well, then, I will offer up mine own self
in the creatures, and the creatures in mine own self.' And, accordingly,
by offering up his own self in the creatures, and the creatures in his
own self, he compassed the supremacy, the sovereignty, and the lordship
over all creatures; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by thus
offering all sacrificial essences <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[1](#fn_1101) in the Sarvamedha, compass all beings,
and supremacy, sovereignty, and lordship.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:2">13:7:1:2</span></span>2. Now
this Sarvamedha is a ten-days’ (Soma-) sacrifice, for the sake of his
gaining and winning every kind of food, for the Virâ*g* consists of ten
syllables, and the Virâ*g* is all food. At this (sacrifice) he builds
the greatest possible fire-altar, for this--to wit, the Sarvamedha--is
supreme amongst all sacrificial performances: by means of the supreme
(sacrifice) he thus causes him (the Sacrificer) to attain supremacy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:3">13:7:1:3</span></span>3. The
first day thereof is an Agnish*t*ut Agnish*t*oma <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[2](#fn_1102), for the sake of his gaining and
winning all the gods, for the Agnish*t*ut Agnish*t*oma is Agni; and all
the gods have Agni (the sacrificial fire) for their mouth, The cups of
Soma thereat pertain to Agni, and so do the Puroru*k* <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[3](#fn_1103) formulas pertain to Agni, in order
that everything should pertain to Agni.

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:4">13:7:1:4</span></span>4. The
second day is an Indrastut Ukthya, for the sake of his gaining and
winning all the gods, for Indra is all the gods. The cups of Soma
thereat pertain to Indra, and so do the Puroru*k* formulas pertain to
Indra, in order that everything should pertain to Indra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:5">13:7:1:5</span></span>5. The
third day is a Sûryastut, Ukthya, for the sake of his gaining and
winning all the gods, for Sûrya is all the gods. The cups of Soma
pertain to Sûrya, and so do the Puroru*k* formulas pertain to Sûrya, in
order that everything should pertain to Sûrya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:6">13:7:1:6</span></span>6. The
fourth day is a Vai*s*vadeva, for the sake of his gaining and winning
all the gods, for the All-gods (Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*) are all the gods. The
cups of Soma pertain to the All-gods, and so do the Puroru*k* formulas
pertain to the All-gods, in order that everything should pertain to the
All-gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:7">13:7:1:7</span></span>7. The
fifth day is a central Â*s*vamedhika <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[1](#fn_1104) one: at this (sacrifice) he seizes a
horse meet for sacrifice, for the sake of his gaining the sacrificial
essence of the horse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:8">13:7:1:8</span></span>8. The
sixth day is a central Paurushamedhika <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[2](#fn_1105) one: at this (sacrifice) he seizes men
meet for sacrifice, for the sake of his gaining the sacrificial essence
of man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:9">13:7:1:9</span></span>9. The
seventh day is an Aptoryâma, for the sake of his gaining all kinds of
Soma-sacrifices: at this (sacrifice) he seizes all kinds of (victims)
meet for sacrifice, both what is animate and what is

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

inanimate. Of those with omenta he offers the omenta, and of those
without omenta they throw down pieces cut out of the skin <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[1](#fn_1106), and of herbs and trees they do so
after cutting them up,--every kind of food of both the dry and the fresh
he offers, in order to gain every kind of food. Everything he offers;
and, to every one he offers in order to gain and to win everything. The
omenta having been offered at the morning-service, and in the same way
the oblations at the evening-service,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:10">13:7:1:10</span></span>10.
The eighth day is a Tri*n*ava one <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[2](#fn_1107), for the Tri*n*ava (stoma) is the
thunderbolt, and by means of the thunderbolt, indeed, lordship (kshatra)
is gained: by means of the thunderbolt he thus gains lordship.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:11">13:7:1:11</span></span>11.
The ninth day is a Trayastri*ms*a one <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[3](#fn_1108), for the sake of his gaining a
foothold, for the Trayastri*ms*a (stoma) is a foothold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:12">13:7:1:12</span></span>12.
The tenth day is a Vi*s*va*g*it Atirâtra with all the
P*ri*sh*th*as <span id="fr_1116"></span>[4](#fn_1109), for the sake of
his gaining and winning everything, for the Vi*s*va*g*it Atirâtra with
all the P*ri*sh*th*as is everything, and the Sarvamedha is everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:13">13:7:1:13</span></span>13.
Now as to the sacrificial fees: whatever there is towards the middle of
the kingdom other than the property of the Brâhma*n*a, but including
land and

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

men, of that the eastern quarter belongs to the Hot*ri*, the southern to
the Brahman, the western to the Adhvaryu, and the northern to the
Udgât*ri*; and the Hot*ri*kas share this along with them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:14">13:7:1:14</span></span>14.
Vi*s*vakarman Bhauvana once performed this sacrifice, and having
performed it he overpassed all beings, and became everything here; and
verily he who, knowing this, performs the Sarvamedha, or who even knows
this, overpasses all beings, and becomes everything here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:7:1:15">13:7:1:15</span></span>15.
It was Ka*s*yapa who officiated in his sacrifice, and it was concerning
this that the Earth <span id="fr_1117"></span>[1](#fn_1110) also sang
the stanza;--'No mortal must give me away; thou wast foolish,
Vi*s*vakarman Bhauvana: she (the earth) will sink into the midst of the
water; vain is this thy promise unto Ka*s*yapa.'
