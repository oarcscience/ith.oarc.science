### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:1">13:4:2:1</span></span>1.
Whilst this (offering to Pûshan) is being performed, the horse, having
been cleansed, is led up--being one which is marked with all colours, or
which is perfect in speed, worth a thousand (cows), in its prime, and
without its match under the right-side yoke <span
id="fr_909"></span>[2](#fn_905).

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:2">13:4:2:2</span></span>2. And
as to its being one marked with all colours, it is for the sake of his
(the Sacrificer's) obtaining and securing everything, for colour
(outward appearance) is everything, and the A*s*vamedha is everything.
And as to its being perfect in speed, it is for the sake of his
obtaining and securing vigour, for speed is vigour. And as to its being
worth a thousand (cows), it is for the sake of his obtaining and
securing everything, for a thousand means everything, and the
A*s*vamedha is everything. And as to its being in its prime, it is for
the sake of his obtaining unlimited vigour, for such a one that is in
the prime (of youth) increases to unlimited vigour. And as to its being
without its match under the right-side yoke, it is for the sake of his
obtaining yonder (sun), for that (horse) indeed is he that shines
yonder, and assuredly there is no one to rival him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:3">13:4:2:3</span></span>3. As
to this, Bhâllaveya, however, said, 'That horse should be of two
colours, black-spotted <span id="fr_910"></span>[1](#fn_906), for that
(horse) was produced from Pra*g*âpati's eye, and this eye is of two
colours, white and black: he thus endows it with its own colour.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:4">13:4:2:4</span></span>4. But
Sâtyaya*gñ*i said, 'That horse should be of three colours, its forepart
black, its hindpart white, with a wain for its mark in front;--when its
forepart is black it is the same as this black of the eye; and when its
hindpart is white it is the same as this white of the eye; and when it
has a wain for its mark in front, that is the pupil: such

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

a one, indeed, is perfect in colour <span
id="fr_911"></span>[1](#fn_907).' Whichever of these, then, should be
ready at hand, either a many-coloured one, or one of two colours, or one
of three colours with a wain for its mark, let him slaughter it: but in
speed it should certainly be perfect.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:5">13:4:2:5</span></span>5. In
front (of the sacrificial ground) there are those keepers of it ready at
hand,--to wit, a hundred royal princes, clad in armour; a hundred
warriors armed with swords; a hundred sons of heralds and headmen,
bearing quivers filled with arrows <span
id="fr_912"></span>[2](#fn_908); and a hundred sons of attendants <span
id="fr_913"></span>[3](#fn_909) and charioteers, bearing staves;--and a
hundred exhausted, worn out horses <span id="fr_914"></span>[4](#fn_910)
amongst which, having let loose that (sacrificial horse), they guard it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:6">13:4:2:6</span></span>6. He
then prepares an (ish*t*i) offering to Savit*ri* <span
id="fr_915"></span>[5](#fn_911)--a cake on twelve potsherds to Savit*ri*
Prasavit*ri*--thinking, May Savit*ri* impel this my sacrifice!' for
Savit*ri* (the sun), indeed, is the impeller (prasavit*ri*).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:7">13:4:2:7</span></span>7. For
this (offering) there are fifteen kindling-verses;

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

and the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of V*ri*tra <span
id="fr_916"></span>[1](#fn_912). \[The verses, *Ri*g-veda V, 82, 9; VII,
45, 1\], 'He who calleth forth all these beings (with his call, may he,
Savit*ri*, quicken us)!' and 'May the divine Savit*ri* come hither,
treasure-laden, (filling the air whilst driving with his steeds; holding
in his hand many things meet for man; and laying to rest and awakening
the world),' pronounced in a low voice, are the invitatory and offering
formulas of the chief oblation. Those of the Svish*t*ak*ri*t are two
virâ*g*-verses <span id="fr_917"></span>[2](#fn_913). The priests’ fee
is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the meaning of this has been
explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:8">13:4:2:8</span></span>8.
Whilst the fore-offerings of this (ish*t*i) are being performed, a
Brâhman lute-player, striking up the uttaramandrâ (tune <span
id="fr_918"></span>[3](#fn_914)), sings three strophes composed by
himself (on topics <span id="fr_919"></span>[4](#fn_915) such as), 'Such
a sacrifice he offered,--Such gifts he gave:' the meaning of this has
been explained <span id="fr_920"></span>[5](#fn_916).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:9">13:4:2:9</span></span>9. He
then prepares a second (offering)--a cake on twelve potsherds to
Savit*ri* Âsavit*ri*--thinking, 'May Savit*ri* propel this my
sacrifice!' for Savit*ri*, indeed, is the propeller (âsavit*ri*).

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:10">13:4:2:10</span></span>10.
For this (offering) there are seventeen kindling-verses; and the two
butter-portions are possessed of that which is <span
id="fr_921"></span>[1](#fn_917): the (truly) existent he thereby
obtains. \[The verses, *Ri*g-veda V, 82, 5; VII, 45, 31 'All troubles, O
divine Savit*ri*, (keep from us, do thou send us that which is good)!'
and 'May that mighty god Savit*ri* (the lord of treasure, send us
treasure; shedding wide-spread lustre, may he bestow upon us the joys of
mortal life)!' pronounced in a low voice, are the invitatory and
offering formulas of the chief oblation. Those of the Svish*t*ak*ri*t
are two anush*t*ubh verses <span id="fr_922"></span>[2](#fn_918). Silver
is the priests’ fee,--for the sake of variety of colour, and also for
the sake of (the horse's) going outside <span
id="fr_923"></span>[3](#fn_919) and not going away. It weighs a hundred
(grains), for man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred
energies: it is life, and energy, vigour, he thus secures for himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:11">13:4:2:11</span></span>11.
Whilst the fore-offerings of this (ish*t*i) are being performed, a
Brâhman lute-player, striking up the uttaramandrâ (tune), sings three
strophes composed by himself (on topics such as), 'Such a sacrifice he
offered,--Such gifts he gave:' the meaning of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:12">13:4:2:12</span></span>12.
He then prepares a third (offering)--a cake

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

on twelve potsherds to Savit*ri* Satyaprasava ('of true impulse'); for
that, indeed, is the true impulse which is Savit*ri*'s: 'May he impel
with true impulse this my sacrifice!' so he thinks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:13">13:4:2:13</span></span>13.
For this (ish*t*i) there are again seventeen kindling-verses. The two
butter-portions are possessed of 'wealth <span
id="fr_924"></span>[1](#fn_920),' with a view to his obtaining and
securing vigour, for wealth is vigour (strength). \[The verses,
*Ri*g-veda V, 82, 7; IV, 54, 4,\] 'The all-divine, true lord (we hope to
gain this day by our hymns, Savit*ri* of true impulsion),' and
'Indestructible is that (work) of the divine Savit*ri*, (that he will
ever sustain the whole world: whatever he, the fair-fingered, bringeth
forth over the extent of the earth and the expanse of the sky, that is
truly his own),' pronounced in a low voice, are the invitatory and
offering formulas of the chief offering. Those of the Svish*t*ak*ri*t
(he makes) the regular ones <span id="fr_925"></span>[2](#fn_921),
thinking, 'Lest I should depart from the path of sacrifice:' he thus
finally establishes himself in the well-ordered sacrifice.
Trish*t*ubh-verses they are for the sake of his gaining and securing
(Indra's) energy, vigour, for the Trish*t*ubh is the vigour in Indra.
The priests’ fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the meaning of
this has been explained <span id="fr_926"></span>[3](#fn_922).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:14">13:4:2:14</span></span>14.
Whilst the fore-offerings of this (ish*t*i) are

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

being performed, a Brâhman lute-player, striking up the uttaramandrâ
(tune), sings three strophes composed by himself (on topics such as),
'Such a sacrifice he offered,--Such gifts he gave:' the meaning of this
has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:15">13:4:2:15</span></span>15.
When this (offering) is completed, the Adhvaryu and the Sacrificer rise,
and whisper in the horse's right ear (Vâ*g*. S. XXII, 19), 'Plenteous by
thy mother, strengthful by dry father . . .!' the meaning of this has
been explained <span id="fr_927"></span>[1](#fn_923). They then set it
free towards the north-east, for that--to wit, the north-east--is the
region of both gods and men: they thus consign it to its own region, in
order to its suffering no injury, for one who is established in his own
home suffers no injury.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:16">13:4:2:16</span></span>16.
He says, 'O ye gods, guardians of the regions, guard ye this horse,
consecrated for offering unto the gods!' The (four kinds of) human
guardians of the (four) regions have been told, and these now are the
divine ones, to wit, the Âpyas, Sâdhyas, Anvâdhyas <span
id="fr_928"></span>[2](#fn_924) and Maruts; and both of these, gods and
men, of one mind, guard it for a year without turning (driving) it back.
The reason why they do not turn it back, is that it is he that shines
yonder,--and who, forsooth, is able to turn him back? But were they to
turn it back, everything here assuredly would go backward (go to ruin):
therefore they guard it without turning it back.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:2:17">13:4:2:17</span></span>17.
He says, 'Ye guardians of the quarters, those who go on to the end of
this (horse-sacrifice) will

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

become (sharers of) the royal power, they will become kings worthy of
being consecrated; but those who do not go on to the end of this
(sacrifice) will be excluded from royal power, they will not become
kings, but nobles and peasants, unworthy of being consecrated: do not ye
therefore be heedless, and keep it (the horse) from water suitable for
bathing and from mares! And whenever ye meet with any kind of
Brâhma*n*as, ask ye them, "O Brâhma*n*as, how much know ye of the
A*s*vamedha?" and those who know naught thereof ye may despoil; for the
A*s*vamedha is everything, and he who, whilst being a Brâhma*n*a, knows
naught of the A*s*vamedha, knows naught of anything, he is not a
Brâhma*n*a, and as such liable to be despoiled. Ye shall give it drink,
and throw down fodder for it; and whatever prepared food there is in the
country all that shall be prepared for you. Your abode shall be in the
house of a carpenter of these (sacrificers <span
id="fr_929"></span>[1](#fn_925)), for there is the horse's
resting-place.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_904"></span>[353:1](sbe44102.htm#fr_908) Viz. according to
Â*s*v. *S*r. X, 6, 7,--*Ri*g-veda I, 45, 6 (tvâ*m* *k*itra*s*ravastama)
and V, 25, 7 (yad vâsish*th*a*m* yad agnaye).

<span id="fn_905"></span>[353:2](sbe44103.htm#fr_909) Thus
Harisvâmin,--'anyebhyo dakshi*n*adhuryebhya utk*ri*sh*t*a*h*;' <span
id="page_354">p. 354</span> hardly 'one which finds no (worthy)
yoke-fellow' (St. Petersb. Dict.).

<span id="fn_906"></span>[354:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_910) Or, black with
some other colour.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[355:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_911) One would expect
an 'iti' here.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[355:2](sbe44103.htm#fr_912) Or, furnished with
bundles of arrows,--ishuparshi*n*a*h*, for which Kâty. XX, 2, 11, has
'kalâpina*h*' (=*s*arâvapanabhastrâvanta*h* schol.). Harisvâmin explains
it as if it were equivalent to 'ishuvarshi*n*a*h*,' 'showering arrows.'

<span id="fn_909"></span>[355:3](sbe44103.htm#fr_913) Harisvâmin takes
'kshâttra' as the body of revenue-officers (tax-gatherers, &c.),
'âyavyayâdhyakshasamûha*h*.'

<span id="fn_910"></span>[355:4](sbe44103.htm#fr_914) That is, according
to Harisvâmin, over twenty-four years old; his explanation being based
on the etymology of 'nirash*t*am' as 'outside the eight' (viz.
characteristics of age in horses, each of which is supposed to hold good
for three years).

<span id="fn_911"></span>[355:5](sbe44103.htm#fr_915) The three ish*t*is
to Savit*ri*, treated of in paragraphs
[6](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:6)-[17](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:17), as well as the
proceedings subsequent thereto, are repeated every day during the
twelvemonth during which the sacred horse is allowed to roam about.

<span id="fn_912"></span>[356:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_916) See [p.
350](sbe44102.htm#page_350), note [3](sbe44102.htm#fn_898).

<span id="fn_913"></span>[356:2](sbe44103.htm#fr_917) See [p.
351](sbe44102.htm#page_351), note [3](sbe44102.htm#fn_901).

<span id="fn_914"></span>[356:3](sbe44103.htm#fr_918) Or, touching the
uttaramandrâ lute,--literally, the 'upper deep' one, i.e. perhaps one
the chords of which are pitched in the upper notes of the lower key. Cf.
Scholl. on Katy. XX, 2, 8 uttaramandrâ *k*a
gâyanaprasiddhâ;--uttaramandrâ-sa*mgñ*âyâ*m* vî*n*âyâm. Harisvâmin does
not explain the term.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[356:4](sbe44103.htm#fr_919) Taitt. Br. III, 9,
14, 3 mentions three topics--one for each stanza,--viz. '*thus* (such
and such gifts) thou gavest, *thus* (by such and such sacrifices) thou
didst sacrifice, *thus* thou didst cook (i.e. with such and such food
thou didst regale the priests).'

<span id="fn_916"></span>[356:5](sbe44103.htm#fr_920) See [XIII, 1, 5,
6](sbe44078.htm#13:1:5:6).

<span id="fn_917"></span>[357:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_921) That is, their
anuvâkyâs contain forms of the root 'as' (or 'bhû'), to be; cf. [p.
352](sbe44102.htm#page_352), note [2](sbe44102.htm#fn_903).

<span id="fn_918"></span>[357:2](sbe44103.htm#fr_922) See [XIII, 4, 1,
15](sbe44102.htm#13:4:1:15), [p. 353](sbe44102.htm#page_353), note
[1](#fn_904).

<span id="fn_919"></span>[357:3](sbe44103.htm#fr_923) Viz. going outside
the sacrificial ground, and yet not running away from its
keepers,--this, according to the text, would be symbolically expressed
by the gold (which was given as the priests’ fee for the first offering)
giving place to silver at the second offering, but coming in again at
the third.

<span id="fn_920"></span>[358:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_924) That is, their
invitatory formulas contain the word 'rayi' (wealth). What particular
verses are intended here, I do not know.

<span id="fn_921"></span>[358:2](sbe44103.htm#fr_925) Viz. the
trish*t*ubh-verses *Ri*g-veda X, 2, 1; VI, 15, 14; see [p.
351](sbe44102.htm#page_351), note .

<span id="fn_922"></span>[358:3](sbe44103.htm#fr_926) [XII, 7, 2,
13](sbe44066.htm#12:7:2:13).

<span id="fn_923"></span>[359:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_927) See [XIII, 1, 6,
1](sbe44079.htm#13:1:6:1) seqq., 3, 7. 1-2 seqq.

<span id="fn_924"></span>[359:2](sbe44103.htm#fr_928) On these divine
beings see Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 6, note.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[360:1](sbe44103.htm#fr_929) Thus
Harisvâmin,--teshâ*m* *k*a ya*g*amânânâ*m* madhye rathakâro yas tasya
g*ri*he yushmâka*m* vasata*h*. The plural is probably meant as including
the subjects of the king (cf. [XI, 8, 4, 1](sbe44044.htm#11:8:4:1)), and
the villages within reach of which the horse will roam.
