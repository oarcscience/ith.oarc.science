And when they enter upon the concluding Atirâtra (of the sacrificial
session), then, indeed, having gained the Year, they establish
themselves in the world of heaven. And were any one to ask them, 'To
what deity are ye offering sacrifice this day? what deity are ye? with
what deity do ye dwell?' let them name of those (deities) the one to
whom they may be nearest (in the performance of the Sattra). And,

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

verily, such (sacrificers) are seated (sad) in the good <span
id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_436) (place), for they are for ever seated
among the good deities; and the others are mere partakers in the
sacrificial session <span id="fr_437"></span>[2](#fn_437); and if any
one were, during a sacrificial session, to speak evil of such initiates
as know this, let them say to him, 'We cut thee off from those deities;'
and he becomes the worse, and they themselves become the better for it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:1:3:23">12:1:3:23</span></span>23.
That same year contains three great rites (mahâvrata):--the great rite
on the *K*aturvi*ms*a day, the great rite on the Vishuvat day, and the
great rite <span id="fr_438"></span>[3](#fn_438) on the Mahâvrata day
itself. Now, those of old used, indeed, to enter upon (perform) that
(year's session) with three great rites, and they became glorious,
truth-speaking, and faithful to their vow; but if nowadays any
(sattrins) were to perform it on this wise, they assuredly would crumble
away even as a jar of unbaked clay would crumble away if water were
poured into it. They (who do so) perform too much: that (object) of
theirs is gained by truth, by toil, by fervid devotion, by faith, by
sacrifice, and by oblations.

1](sbe44117.htm#14:1:1)-[3](sbe44123.htm#14:3:1); and part ii, p. 104,
note 3.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[141:2](sbe44047.htm#fr_431) Viz. Agni, Soma,
and Vish*n*u; cf. part ii, p. 305, note 1.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[141:3](sbe44047.htm#fr_432) See part ii, p.
162 seqq.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[141:4](sbe44047.htm#fr_433) Viz. inasmuch as
the Atirâtra includes both a day and a night performance.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[141:5](sbe44047.htm#fr_434) Viz. both because
this is the real opening day of the year's session, and because
Pra*g*âpati (as the Purusha and the Year) is '*k*aturvi*ms*a' or
'twenty-four-fold' (e*g*. VI, 2, 1, 23).

<span id="fn_435"></span>[142:1](sbe44047.htm#fr_435) See [p.
140](sbe44046.htm#page_140), note [1](sbe44046.htm#fn_427).

<span id="fn_436"></span>[144:1](sbe44047.htm#fr_436) Or, in the true,
abiding (place)--sati.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[144:2](sbe44047.htm#fr_437) That is, those who
perform a sacrificial session (sattra) without their possessing the
esoteric knowledge regarding the several ceremonies, set forth in the
preceding paragraphs, are mere 'sattrasada*h*' (i.e. 'merely sitting
through the sacrificial session') whilst those possessing that knowledge
are 'sari sada*h*.'

<span id="fn_438"></span>[144:3](sbe44047.htm#fr_438) That is, more
especially, the chanting of the Mahâvrata-sâman, for which see part iv,
p. 282, note 5.
