### EIGHTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:8:1">11:5:8:1</span></span>1.
Verily, in the beginning, Pra*g*âpati alone was here. He desired, 'May I
exist, may I be generated.' He wearied himself and performed fervid
devotions: from him, thus wearied and heated, the three worlds were
created--the earth, the air, and the sky.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:8:2">11:5:8:2</span></span>2. He
heated these three worlds, and from them, thus heated, three lights
(*g*yotis) were produced--Agni (the fire), he who blows here (Vâyu), and
Sûrya (the sun).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:8:3">11:5:8:3</span></span>3. He
heated these three lights, and from them, thus heated, the three Vedas
were produced--the *Ri*g-veda from Agni, the Ya*g*ur-veda from Vâyu, and
the Sâma-veda from Sûrya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:8:4">11:5:8:4</span></span>4. He
heated these three Vedas, and from them, thus heated, three luminous
essences <span id="fr_330"></span>[1](#fn_330) were produced--

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'bhû*h*' from the
*Ri*g-veda, 'bhuva*h*' from the Ya*g*ur-veda, and 'svar' from the
Sâma-veda. And with the *Ri*g-veda they then performed the work of the
Hot*ri* priest, with the Ya*g*ur-veda the work of the Adhvaryu, and with
the Sâma-veda the work of the Udgât*ri*; and what luminous essence <span
id="fr_331"></span>[1](#fn_331) there was in the threefold science,
therewith the work of the Brahman priest then proceeded.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:8:5">11:5:8:5</span></span>5. The
gods spake unto Pra*g*âpati, 'If our sacrifice were to fail in respect
of either the *Rik*, or the Ya*g*us, or the Sâman, whereby should we
heal it?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:8:6">11:5:8:6</span></span>6. He
spake, ‘If (it were to fail) in respect of the *Rik*, ye should take
ghee by four ladlings and offer it in the Gârhapatya fire with 'Bhû*h*!'
and if in respect of the Ya*g*us, ye should take ghee by four ladlings
and offer it in the Âgnîdhrîya--or in the Anvâhâryapa*k*ana <span
id="fr_332"></span>[2](#fn_332) in the case of a Havirya*gñ*a--with
'Bhuva*h*!' and if in respect of the Sâman, ye should take ghee by four
ladlings and offer it in the Âhavanîya with 'Svar!' But if it should not
be known (where the mistake has occurred), ye should make offering in
the Âhavanîya after uttering

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

rapidly all (the three sacred words <span
id="fr_333"></span>[1](#fn_333)): thus one heals the *Ri*g-veda by the
*Ri*g-veda <span id="fr_334"></span>[2](#fn_334), the Ya*g*ur-veda by
the Ya*g*ur-veda, and the Sâma-veda by the Sâma-veda;--even as one would
put together joint with joint <span id="fr_335"></span>[3](#fn_335), so
does he put together (the broken part of the sacrifice) whoever heals it
by means of these (three sacred words). But if he heals it in any other
way than this, it would be just as if one tried to put together
something that is broken with something else that is broken, or as if
one were to apply some poison as lotion to a broken part <span
id="fr_336"></span>[4](#fn_336). Let him therefore appoint only one who
knows this (to officiate as) his Brahman, and not one who does not know
this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:8:7">11:5:8:7</span></span>7. As
to this they say, 'Seeing that the work of the Hot*ri* is performed with
the *Ri*g-veda, that of the Adhvaryu with the Ya*g*ur-veda, and that of
the Udgât*ri* with the Sâma-veda, wherewith then is the work of the
Brahman (performed)?' Let him reply, 'With that threefold science.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_330"></span>[102:1](sbe44032.htm#fr_330) ? Sâya*n*a takes
'*s*ukra' here in the sense of 'flame, light' (vyâh*ri*tirûpâ*n*i
te*g*â*m*si); whilst the St. Petersb. Dict. assigns to it the meaning of
'sap, juice' (Saft, Seim, cf. next note). Ait. Br. V, 32, contains a
very similar passage in which the same process of evolution is set
forth:--Pra*g*âpati first creates the three worlds, earth, air, and
heaven. From them, being heated by him, three lights (*g*yotis) are
produced--Agni from the earth, Vâyu from the air, and Âditya from the
sky (or heaven). From them, being heated, the three Vedas are
produced--the *Ri*g-veda from Agni, the Ya*g*ur-veda from Vâyu, and the
Sâma-veda from Âditya. From the Vedas, being heated, three flames
(*s*ukra, luminaries, Haug) are produced--Bhû*h* from the *Ri*g-veda,
Bhuva*h* from the Ya*g*ur-veda, <span id="page_103">p. 103</span> and
Svar from the Sâma-veda. From these in the same way are produced three
sounds (or letters, var*n*a), â, u and m, which being combined yield the
syllable 'Om.' Cp. J. Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, vol. iii, p. 4.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[103:1](sbe44032.htm#fr_331) Here Sâya*n*a also
seems to take '*s*ukra' in the sense of 'pure, essential
part'--nirmala*m* rûpa*m* sâratvatâ*ms*a*h* (!).

<span id="fn_332"></span>[103:2](sbe44032.htm#fr_332) That is, the
Dakshi*n*âgni. At the Havirya*gñ*a (of which class of sacrifices,
performed in the Prâ*k*înava*ms*a hall, the full and new moon serves as
model) there is no Âgnîdhrîya, which is, however, required for the
Soma-sacrifice. See the plan in part ii, p. 475.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[104:1](sbe44032.htm#fr_333) According to
Sâya*n*a, offering would be used with the formula 'Bhûr bhuva*h* sva*h*,
svâhâ!'

<span id="fn_334"></span>[104:2](sbe44032.htm#fr_334) Viz. by the word
'bhû*h*,' representing that Veda.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[104:3](sbe44032.htm#fr_335) Yathâ khalu loke
bhagna*m* hastapâdâdiparva tatsannihitenânyena parva*n*â purushâya
sa*m*dadhyât sa*ms*leshayet, evam evânena vyâh*ri*ti*gñ*ânena tat tad
avedokta*m* prabh*ri*sh*t*am aṅga*m* puna*h* sahita*m* bhavati, Sây.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[104:4](sbe44032.htm#fr_336) ? Or, as if one
were to put some fluid into some broken (vessel; or, on some broken
part),--yathâ *s*îr*n*ena bhagnena anya*k* *kh*îr*n*a*m* bhagna*m* vastu
sa*m*dhitset sa*m*dhâtum i*kkh*et; yathâ vâ *s*îr*n*e gara*m*
