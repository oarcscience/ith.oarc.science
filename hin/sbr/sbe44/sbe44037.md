### SEVENTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE ANIMAL SACRIFICE <span id="fr_365"></span>[1](#fn_365).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:1:1">11:7:1:1</span></span>1. He
performs the animal sacrifice. Now the animal sacrifice means cattle:
thus, when he performs the animal sacrifice (pa*s*ubandha, the binding
of the animal), it is in order that he may be possessed of cattle. Let
him perform it at his home, thinking, 'I will bind (attach) cattle to my
home.' Let him perform it in the season of abundant fodder, thinking, 'I
will bind to myself cattle in a season of abundant fodder.' For, whilst
he is offering <span id="fr_366"></span>[2](#fn_366), the Sacrificer's
fires become worn out, and so does the Sacrificer, along with the
worn-out fires, and along with the Sacrificer his house and cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:1:2">11:7:1:2</span></span>2. And
when he performs the animal sacrifice, he renews his fires, and so,
along with the renewal of his fires, does the Sacrificer (renew
himself), and along with the Sacrificer his house and cattle. And
beneficial to life, indeed, is that redemption of his

own self <span id="fr_367"></span>[1](#fn_367); for whilst he is
offering the Sacrificer's fires long for flesh; they set their minds on
the Sacrificer and harbour designs on him. In other fires <span
id="fr_368"></span>[2](#fn_368) people do indeed cook any kind of meat,
but these (sacrificial fires) have no desire for any other flesh but
this (sacrificial animal), and for him to whom they belong.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:1:3">11:7:1:3</span></span>3. Now,
when he performs the animal offering. he thereby redeems himself--male
by male, for the victim is a male, and the Sacrificer is a male. And
this, indeed, to wit, flesh, is the best kind of food: he thus becomes
an eater of the best kind of food. Let not a year pass by for him
without his offering; for the year means life: it is thus immortal life
he thereby confers upon himself.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_365"></span>[118:1](sbe44037.htm#fr_365) Whilst a full
account is given in the third Kâ*nd*a (part ii, p. 162 seqq.) of the
animal sacrifice performed on the day before the Soma-sacrifice, the
Brâhma*n*a, in the last two adhyâyas of the present Kâ*nd*a, touches on
certain features in which the performance of the animal sacrifice of the
pressing-day differs from that of the preceding day.

<span id="fn_366"></span>[118:2](sbe44037.htm#fr_366) Viz. the Agnihotra
every morning and evening.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[119:1](sbe44037.htm#fr_367) That is, the
ransoming of one's own life from the sacrificial fires, by offering an
animal victim to them in lieu of his own self.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[119:2](sbe44037.htm#fr_368) That is, in
ordinary, culinary fires.
