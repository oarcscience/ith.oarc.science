<p>and whatever food a man consumes in this world, that (food), in return, consumes him in yonder world. Now this sacrifice is performed by means of spirituous liquor, and spirituous liquor (parisrut) is not to be consumed by a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a: he thus is born from that which is not (to be) consumed, and the food does not, in return, consume him in yonder world. Therefore this (sacrifice), the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, is a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a's sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_659"></A><A HREF="#fn_656"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>

The malted rice is the same as his (the man's) hair, the malted barley his skin, the fried rice his flesh, the filtering-cloth his bones, the mash his marrow, the raw liquor (parisrut) his life-sap (serum), the seasoning (and fermentative substances) his blood, the milk his seed, the mature liquor (sur&acirc;) his urine, and the impure matter the contents of the stomach.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:3">12:9:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. Indra's cake is his heart, that of Savit<I>ri</I> his liver, that of Varu<I>n</I>a his lung, the a<I>s</I>vattha and udumbara vessels his kidneys, the nyagrodha one his bile, the pan (sth&acirc;l&icirc;) his intestines&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_660"></A><A HREF="#fn_657"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the supernumerary (vessels) his bowels&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_661"></A><A HREF="#fn_657"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the two eagle feathers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_662"></A><A HREF="#fn_658"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the milt, the throne-seat his navel, the pot his rectum, the (pan) perforated with a hundred holes, the male organ,--and inasmuch as that (pan) is much perforated, therefore that organ is much divided,--the bowl (sata) is his mouth, the strainer</p>

<p>his tongue, the dish (<I>k</I>apya) his anus, the tail (whisk) his bladder,</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:4">12:9:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. And the sacrificial animal of the A<I>s</I>vins is his limbs, that of Sarasvat&icirc; his trunk, Indra's bull his form,--whence they say that man's form (wealth) is kine,--the gold (plate) is his vital strength; it is of the weight of a hundred (grains), whence mark has a life of a hundred (years).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:5">12:9:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. The two cups of the A<I>s</I>vins are his eyes, and the ground wheat and kuvala (jujubes) his eyelashes; the two cups of Sarasvat&icirc; are his nostrils, and the ground Indra-grain and badara (jujubes) the hair in his nostrils; the two cups of Indra are his ears, and the ground barley and karkandhu (jujubes) the hair of his ears and his eyebrows.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:6">12:9:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. And the hairs of wolf are the hair on his abdomen and that below; and the hairs of tiger are the hair on his chest and that of his armpits; and the hairs of lion are the hair of his head and his beard.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:7">12:9:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. There are three sacrificial animals, for this body of man consists of three parts: it is the body he thereby wins (in heaven) for him;--what is below the navel (he wins) by that of the A<I>s</I>vins, what is above the navel and below the head by that of Sarasvat&icirc;, and the head itself by that of Indra: both as to its (bodily) form and as to its deities he thus delivers his own self from death, and makes it immortal.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:8">12:9:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. There are three sacrificial cakes, for this life of man consists of three parts: it is life he thereby wins for him;--the early life (he wins) by that of Indra, the middle (part of) life by that of Savit<I>ri</I>, and the last (part of) life by that of Varu<I>n</I>a: both as to its (bodily) form and as to its deities he thus delivers his life from death, and makes it immortal.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_262"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 262</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:9">12:9:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. There are six cups (of milk and liquor), for there are these six (channels of) vital airs in the head: it is the vital airs he thereby wins for him;--his eyes (he wins) by the two (cups) of the A<I>s</I>vins, his nostrils by those of Sarasvat&icirc;, and his ears by those of Indra: both as to its (bodily) form and as to its deities he thus delivers his own self from death, and makes it immortal.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:10">12:9:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. The invitatory and offering-formulas are made continuous&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_663"></A><A HREF="#fn_659"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and relate to the same deities--for the continuity and uninterruptedness of the vital airs. They are all of them invitatory formulas and all offering-formulas, whence all the vital airs pass onwards and all of them backwards. All (the formulas) are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last, whence all the vital airs are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last. All the cups have two (formulas, an) invitatory and (an) offering-formula,--this is of the form of the in (and out)-breathing and the up-breathing: it is the in-breathing and the up-breathing he thus secures for himself, and therefore all the vital airs are established on the in-breathing and the up-breathing.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:11">12:9:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. Verily the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; is this body (of man): the Sacrificer is the mind, (that is) speech manifestly; the vedi (altar-ground) is the trunk, the uttara-vedi (high-altar) offspring, the barhis (grass-covering) cattle, the officiating priests the limbs, the fuel the hones, the ghee the marrow, the fire the mouth, the oblation is food, and the concluding rite is life, whence he who has performed the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; attains life.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:12">12:9:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. And, verily, these two men that seem to be in the eyes, they belong to the A<I>s</I>vins, and the black (in the eye) belongs to Sarasvat&icirc;, and the white to Indra; and in that, when the victim of the A<I>s</I>vins is being (offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:13">12:9:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. Indra, assuredly, is the mind, Sarasvat&icirc; speech, and the two A<I>s</I>vins are the ears. Now, whatever one thinks in his mind of that he speaks with his speech, and what he speaks with his speech that one hears with one's ears: thus, in that, when the victim of Sarasvat&icirc; is being (offered), he makes offering to these deities together, thereby he puts these (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:14">12:9:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. Indra, assuredly, is the breath, Sarasvat&icirc; the tongue, and the two A<I>s</I>vins the nostrils; and inasmuch as through (the channel of) the breath (pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a) one introduces (pr&acirc;-<I>n</I>&icirc;) food into himself that is the reason of its being (called) 'pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a.' By means of the tongue one distinguishes the essence (taste) of food, and the nostrils, indeed, are the path of the breath; and in that, when the victim of Indra. is being (offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:15">12:9:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. Indra, assuredly, is the heart, Savit<I>ri</I> the liver, and Varu<I>n</I>a the lung; and in that, when Indra's cake is being (offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:16">12:9:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. Savit<I>ri</I>, assuredly, is the breath, Varu<I>n</I>a the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_264"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 264</FONT></A></p>  
<p>through-breathing, and Indra the generative organ; and whatever food one eats by means of (the channel of) the breath through that he breathes with his through-breathing, and by means of the generative organ he sheds the essence of food as seed; and in that, when Savit<I>ri</I>'s cake is being (offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:1:17">12:9:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. Varu<I>n</I>a, assuredly, is the womb, Indra the seed, and Savit<I>ri</I> the generator of the seed; and in that, when Varu<I>n</I>a's cake is being (offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself. And whosoever thus knows this comes into being along with these deities, and is born again (so as to be) along with these deities; he increases in offspring and cattle; he becomes firmly established in this world, and wins the heavenly world, whosoever, knowing this, performs the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, or whosoever thus knows this.</p>
