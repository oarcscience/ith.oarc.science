### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:1">12:8:3:1</span></span>1.
Tvash*tri*, seeing his son slain, brought Soma suitable for witchery,
and withheld from Indra. Indra, committing a desecration of the
sacrifice, by main force drank off his (Tvash*tri*'s) Soma juice. He
went asunder in every direction,--from his mouth and vital airs his
excellence and fame passed

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

away, and entered the cattle, whence cattle are one's fame: and famous,
indeed, is he who, knowing this, is consecrated <span
id="fr_630"></span>[1](#fn_628.md) by the Sautrâma*n*î.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:2">12:8:3:2</span></span>2. The
two A*s*vins and Sarasvatî then prepared for him this sacrifice, the
Sautrâma*n*î, for the purpose of healing him, and thereby consecrated
him: thereby he became the highest of gods, and so does he who is
consecrated by that (offering) become the highest among his own people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:3">12:8:3:3</span></span>3. He
consecrates him on a black antelope skin; for the black antelope skin is
the sacrifice <span id="fr_631"></span>[2](#fn_629.md): it is at the
sacrifice he thus consecrates him; on the hairy side (of the skin), for
the hair is the metres: it is on the metres (or sacred writ) he thus
consecrates him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:4">12:8:3:4</span></span>4. On a
throne-seat he consecrates him, for imperial dignity is seated
(established) on a throne-seat: by means of imperial dignity he thus
causes him to attain imperial dignity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:5">12:8:3:5</span></span>5. It
is made of udumbara wood, for the udumbara (ficus glomerata) is
strength: for the sake of strength he thus is consecrated. It is
knee-high, for knee-high is this (terrestrial) world, and it is for (the
rule of) this world that the Kshatriya is consecrated; and the ruler
(kshatra) indeed he becomes who is consecrated by the Sautrâma*n*î:
therefore it is knee-high, and of unlimited size horizontally (in width
and depth),--

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:6">12:8:3:6</span></span>6. For
the throne-seat means royal dignity, and of unlimited prosperity is
royal dignity. It is covered with plaited reed-work, for reed-grass is
meet for sacrifice. Two of its feet stand on the

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

northern, and two on the southern altar-ground <span
id="fr_632"></span>[1](#fn_630.md), for the northern vedi is this
(terrestrial) world, and the southern one the world of the Fathers: he
thus consecrates him for both worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:7">12:8:3:7</span></span>7.
Concerning this, Gaurîviti *S*âktya, knowing this, once said, 'Like
rulers <span id="fr_633"></span>[2](#fn_631.md), assuredly, we shall be in
yonder world!' Perhaps <span id="fr_634"></span>[3](#fn_632.md) it was
Rishabha Yâ*gñ*atura, king of the Svikna, who had told him so.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:8">12:8:3:8</span></span>8. He
places the throne-seat, with (Vâ*g*. S. XX, 1), 'Thou art the womb of
the Kshatra, thou art the navel of the Kshatra!' for it indeed is the
womb and navel of the Kshatra (ruling power).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:9">12:8:3:9</span></span>9. He
then spreads the black antelope skin thereon, with, 'May it not injure
thee! do not

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

injure me!' for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice: (thus it is
spread) for the safety of the sacrifice and his own self.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:10">12:8:3:10</span></span>10.
He then mounts it, with a verse to Varu*n*a (Vâ*g*. S. XX, 2), for
Varu*n*a is the king of the gods: by means of his own deity he thus
consecrates him <span id="fr_635"></span>[1](#fn_633.md),--'He hath sat
down, the upholder of the sacred law, Varu*n*a, in the home-steads, for
supreme rule, he the wise!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:11">12:8:3:11</span></span>11.
He then throws down a gold and a silver plate (beneath his feet, the
silver one beneath the left foot) with, 'Protect (me) from death!' (the
gold one beneath the right foot <span id="fr_636"></span>[2](#fn_634.md)
with,) 'Protect (me) from lightning!' The Virâ*g*, doubtless, is the
rain, and of this there are these two terrible forms, lightning and
hail; of these the gold plate is of the form of lightning, and the
silver one of that of hail: against these two deities he affords
protection to him, whence he who has performed the Sautrâma*n*î has no
fear of these two deities, as he also who thus knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:12">12:8:3:12</span></span>12.
He consecrates him by sprinkling him with the fat gravy of the
sacrificial animals, for the gravy of the animals means excellence: with
that excellence, the essence of cattle, he thus sprinkles him. But that
gravy is also the highest kind of food: with the highest kind of food he
thus sprinkles him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:13">12:8:3:13</span></span>13.
There are hoof-cups (of gravy), for on hoofs cattle support themselves:
he thus causes him to obtain a support. There are thirty-three (such)

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

cupfuls, for thirty-three in number are all the deities: by means of all
the deities he thus consecrates him. He offers them with *g*agatî
verses, for animals are of *g*âgata (movable) nature: by means of the
*G*agatî he thus secures cattle for him. With sixteen verses (Vâ*g*. S.
XIX, 80-94) he offers, for animals are of sixteen parts: he thus bestows
excellence (or prosperity) on him part by part.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:14">12:8:3:14</span></span>14.
'With lead the wise, with wool and thread <span
id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_635.md) the sages weave the web, the sacrifice:
the A*s*vins, Savit*ri*, Sarasvatî, and Varu*n*a healed the form of
Indra <span id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_636.md).' Each time he has offered
two (cupfuls) together, he pours the residue into a bowl (sata): he
thereby establishes the days and nights, the half-months, the months,
and the seasons in the year, and hence these days and nights,
half-months, months, and seasons are established (contained) in the
year.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:15">12:8:3:15</span></span>15.
The bowl is made of reed, for the reed has its birth-place in the
waters, and the waters are all the deities: by means of all the deities
he thus consecrates him.

16\. A rubbing down (of the Sacrificer) with all manner of
sweet-smelling substances takes place (before sprinkling him with fat),
for such a rubbing down with all manner of sweet-smelling substances
means supreme fragrance: with fragrance he thus consecrates (anoints)
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:17">12:8:3:17</span></span>17.
He sprinkles him (with the fat gravy) in front while (himself) looking
towards the back (west), for

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

from the front food is visibly eaten. On. every side (he sprinkles him)
whilst moving round: he thus bestows food on him from all quarters,
whence food is secured from all quarters by him who has performed the
Sautrâma*n*î, or even by him who thus knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:18">12:8:3:18</span></span>18.
With a formula to the A*s*vins he sprinkles him first <span
id="fr_639"></span>[1](#fn_637.md), then with one to Sarasvatî, then with
one to Indra: it is by means of these deities he thus consecrates him.
Now, some consecrate him by means both of these deities and those
utterances, 'bhû*h* bhuva*h*, svar,' 'for,' say they, 'these utterances
("earth, air, heaven") mean all this (universe) it is by means of all
this (universe) we thus consecrate him.' Let him, however, not do so,
but let him only consecrate him by means of those deities, for those
deities, indeed, are all this (universe).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:19">12:8:3:19</span></span>19.
He consecrates him prior to the Svish*t*ak*ri*t (offering), for the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t is the Kshatra: he thus consecrates him by means of the
Kshatra (or, by a Kshatriya). And he consecrates him between (the
oblation to) the Lord of the Forest <span
id="fr_640"></span>[2](#fn_638.md) and the

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Svish*t*ak*ri*t,
for the lord of the forest (or the tree) is Soma, and the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t (maker of good offering) is Agni: he thus consecrates
him after encompassing him by Agni and Soma; whence both those who know,
and those who do not, say, 'A Kshatriya is the consecrator of a
Kshatriya <span id="fr_641"></span>[1](#fn_639.md).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:20">12:8:3:20</span></span>20.
They then lift him up <span id="fr_642"></span>[2](#fn_640.md) knee-high,
then navel-high, then as high as the mouth; for the Vâ*g*apeya doubtless
is the same as the consecration, and the Sautrâma*n*î is a consecration;
and even as there, at the Vâ*g*apeya, he (the Sacrificer) mounts the
sacrificial stake <span id="fr_643"></span>[3](#fn_641.md), like that is
this rite.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:21">12:8:3:21</span></span>21.
As to this they say, 'But, surely, he who is consecrated by the
Sautrâma*n*î moves away from this world.' Well, he descends again upon
the black antelope skin, and, the black antelope skin being the
sacrifice, he thus finally establishes himself on the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:22">12:8:3:22</span></span>22.
\[He descends <span id="fr_644"></span>[4](#fn_642.md), with Vâ*g*. S. XX,
10,\] 'Firmly <span id="fr_645"></span>[5](#fn_643.md) I establish myself
in the Kshatra (lordship), in royal sway,'--in lordship and royal sway
he thus establishes himself so as not to lose lordship and royal
sway;--'firmly in horses I establish

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

myself, and in kine,'--in the midst of horses and kine he thus
establishes himself so as not to lose horses and kine;--'firmly in the
limbs I establish myself, and in the body,'--in the limbs and in the
body he thus establishes himself so as not to lose his limbs and his
body;--'firmly in the vital airs I establish myself, and in
prosperity,'--in the vital airs and in prosperity he thus establishes
himself so as not to lose the vital airs and prosperity;--'firmly in
heaven and on earth I establish myself, and in the sacrifice,'--he thus
establishes himself in these two, heaven and earth, within which is all
this (universe).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:23">12:8:3:23</span></span>23.
He <span id="fr_646"></span>[1](#fn_644) then sings a Sâman (hymn-tune.md),
for the Sâman means lordship (kshatra): with lordship he thus
consecrates him; or the Sâman means imperial sway: by means of imperial
sway he thus causes him to attain imperial sway. And, indeed, the Sâman
is the essence of all the Vedas: he thus consecrates him with the
essence of all the Vedas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:24">12:8:3:24</span></span>24.
He sings it on a b*ri*hatî verse <span id="fr_647"></span>[2](#fn_645.md),
for established on the B*ri*hatî, as his excellence and foundation,

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

that sun shines <span id="fr_648"></span>[1](#fn_646.md): he thus
establishes him on the B*ri*hatî, as his excellence and foundation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:25">12:8:3:25</span></span>25.
He sings it on a b*ri*hatî verse relating to Indra, for this sacrifice,
the Sautrâma*n*î, belongs to Indra, and even now he who sacrifices has
Indra for his support: he thus consecrates him on his own support (or
resting-place).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:26">12:8:3:26</span></span>26.
And as to why (these hymns) are called 'bracers <span
id="fr_649"></span>[2](#fn_647.md);' it is because by means of these Sâmans
the gods braced Indra up to energy, or vital power: in like manner do
the officiating priests, by means of these Sâmans, brace the Sacrificer
up to energy, or vital power. 'Sa*ms*ravase, vi*s*ravase,
satya*s*ravase, *s*ravase <span id="fr_650"></span>[3](#fn_648.md)'--these
are the Sâmans: they proclaim

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

him in these worlds. There are four *finales*, for there are four
quarters: they thus establish him in all the quarters. All (the priests)
join in the *finale:* with one mind they thus bestow excellence upon
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:27">12:8:3:27</span></span>27.
As to this they say, 'Seeing that this Sâman is sung, wherein then does
the recitation (uktha) of this Sâman consist, and what is its
foundation; for unsuccessful is what is chanted unless it be followed by
a recitation?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:28">12:8:3:28</span></span>28.
'Thrice eleven are the gods;' this, indeed, is the recitation <span
id="fr_651"></span>[1](#fn_649.md) belonging to that Sâman, this its
foundation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:29">12:8:3:29</span></span>29.
Or he (the Adhvaryu) takes a thirty-third cupful (of gravy), with
(Vâ*g*. S. XX, 11-12  <span id="fr_652"></span>[1](#fn_649).md), 'Thrice

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

eleven are the gods,'--for there are indeed thrice eleven
gods;--'three-and-thirty, bountiful,'--for there are thirty-three gods;
'with B*ri*haspati for their Purohita,'--B*ri*haspati is the Brahman
(n.): he thus means to say, 'With the Brahman for their Purohita
(family-priest);'--'at the impulse (sava) of the god Savit*ri*,'--that
is, 'impelled by the god Savit*ri*;'--'may the gods protect me through
the gods!' for the gods indeed consecrate him through the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:30">12:8:3:30</span></span>30.
'The first with the second,'--for the first (gods, on earth) consecrate
him along with the second ones (in the air);--'the second with the
third,'--for the second ones consecrate him along with the third ones
(in the sky);--'the third with <span id="fr_653"></span>[1](#fn_650.md) the
truth,'--for the third ones consecrate him with the truth;--'the truth
with the sacrifice,'--for the truth consecrates him with the
sacrifice;--'the sacrifice with sacrificial texts,'--for the sacrifice
consecrates him with sacrificial texts;--'sacrificial texts with
hymn-tunes,'--for sacrificial texts (ya*g*us) consecrate him along with
hymn-tunes 'hymn-tunes with hymn-verses,'--for hymn-tunes consecrate him
along with hymn-verses (*rik*):--'hymn-verses with invitatory
verses,'--for hymn-verses consecrate him along with invitatory
verses;--'invitatory verses with offering-verses,'--for invitatory
verses consecrate him along with offering-verses;--'offering-verses with
Vasha*t*-calls,'--for offering-verses consecrate him

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

along with Vasha*t*-calls;--'Vasha*t*-calls with oblations,'--for
Vasha*t*-calls consecrate him along with oblations;--'May the oblations
render successful my wishes! bhû*h*! svâhâ!'--having thus consecrated
him by means of those deities from first to last, he thus, by means of
oblations, renders all his wishes successful. Having then solicited an
invitation from the officiating priests, he (the Sacrificer)
drinks <span id="fr_654"></span>[1](#fn_651.md) (the remains of the cup of
vasâ), for the officiating priests are the seasons: it is thus in the
seasons that he solicits art invitation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:3:31">12:8:3:31</span></span>31.
He drinks it, with (Vâ*g*. S. XX, 13), 'My hair is endeavour <span
id="fr_655"></span>[2](#fn_652.md), my skin submission and approach <span
id="fr_656"></span>[3](#fn_653.md), my flesh inclination, my bone wealth,
and my marrow submission,'--for he who is consecrated by the
Sautrâma*n*î enters the worlds and among the deities; he now has
himself, invited amongst them <span id="fr_657"></span>[4](#fn_654.md), and
thus he arises (in the other world) complete, with a whole body, and
with (all) limbs.

the cooking of the sacrificial animals.

Kshatriyas,' Delbrück, Altind. Synt., p. 494.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[250:3](sbe44070.htm#fr_634.md) For this or some
such meaning ('probably'--German, 'wohl' or 'vielleicht') which seems to
me to suit best the use of '*s*a*s*vat' in the Brâhma*n*as, see part
iii, p. 98, note 2.--Thus, at I, 2, 3, 2, I would now translate 'and
perhaps it was Trita who slew him,--Indra at all events was exonerated
from that (guilt), for he is a god.' Similarly, I, 8, 1, 4, 'perhaps it
was a *gh*asha, for that (fish) grows best (fastest);' II, 2, 1, 2, 'If,
on the other hand, that oblation were not offered up in him, he would
perhaps burn either the Adhvaryu, or the Sacrificer.' Somewhat peculiar
is the passage, I, 6, 3, 10, where *s*a*s*vat occurs both in the
relative and in the demonstrative clause, and where we can hardly
translate otherwise than 'If, perchance, he had said, "Grow thou, the
foe of Indra!" he (V*ri*tra) would perhaps have slain Indra.'--Hätte er
vielleicht (etwa) gesagt: 'Wachse, du Feind Indras!' so würde er
(V*ri*tra) vielleicht (? gewiss) Indra erschlagen haben.--If this be the
right interpretation of these passages, they would have td be
transferred, in the St. Petersb. Dict., from meaning b (?) to c, where
'vielleicht' would have to be added, as it certainly suits better than
'gewiss' (most likely) the last of the foregoing passages, at all
events. The comm. explains '*s*a*s*vat' by 'bahuk*ri*tva*h*.'

<span id="fn_633"></span>[251:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_635.md) Cf. V, 4, 4, 5,
where the verse is explained.

according to others. The plates are of the usual round shape.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[252:2](sbe44070.htm#fr_638.md) Only the first
pâda of this, the first of the sixteen verses, is given in the text.
Regarding the allusions in this verse, see [XII, 7, 1,
10](sbe44065.htm#12:7:1:10.md) seqq.; 2, 17; 7, 3, 3.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[253:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_639.md) According to Katy.
*S*r. XIX, 4, 14-17, he sprinkles him up to the mouth, letting it flow
down on all four sides; and with each sprinkling he pronounces one of
the formulas, first, the Sâvitra one, Vâ*g*. S. XX, 3, 'At the impulse
of God Savit*ri* (I consecrate) thee by the arms of the A*s*vins, and
the heads of Pûshan!' followed by the Â*s*vina one, 'with the healing
medicine of the A*s*vins I sprinkle thee for energy and holy lustre!'
and the Sârasvata one, 'with the healing medicine of Sarasvatî I
sprinkle thee for vigour and food!' Then a fourth time with a formula
referring to all the deities (or with the three great utterances), or
with the Aindra text, 'With Indra's power I sprinkle thee for strength,
for excellence, and for fame!'

<span id="fn_638"></span>[253:2](sbe44070.htm#fr_640.md) For this oblation,
see III, 8, 3, 33; IV, 5, 2, 11; in both cases it is followed
immediately by the oblation to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[254:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_641.md) Kshatriyo

<span id="fn_640"></span>[254:2](sbe44070.htm#fr_642.md) According to Kâty.
Sr. XIX, 4, 19-2I, the Adhvaryu first touches him, with (Vâ*g*. S. XX,
4), 'Thou art Ka, thou art Katama,--to Ka thee!' and the Sacrificer
replies, 'O thou of good fame! O most propitious one! O true king!' and
touches his limbs one after another with XX, 5-9.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[254:3](sbe44070.htm#fr_643.md) See part iii, p.
32 (V, 2, 1, 9 seqq.).

<span id="fn_642"></span>[254:4](sbe44070.htm#fr_644.md) That is, when the
throne-seat has been lowered again, he rises from it and stands on the
deer-skin.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[254:5](sbe44070.htm#fr_645.md) The function of
'prati' here seems to be to strengthen the preposition in the verb
'prati-tish*th*âmi.'

<span id="fn_644"></span>[255:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_646.md) According to the
commentator on Kâty. XIX, 5, 1, the Brahman sings, whilst Lâ*t*y. V, 4,
16-19 gives directions from which the Udgât*ri* would seem to be
expected to perform this duty. When the Sacrificer is being anointed,
the Udgât*ri* is to step between the (northern and southern) fires and,
as soon as he is called upon by the Adhvaryu, he is to commence the
Sâman. It would probably depend on the Brahman's previous studies,
whether or not he was sufficiently conversant with the complicated
details of the hymnology.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[255:2](sbe44070.htm#fr_647.md) Viz. Vâ*g*. S. XX,
30 (Riks. VIII, 89, 1), 'To Indra, O Maruts, sing ye the great (hymn),
most destructive to V*ri*tra, whereby the promoters of sacred rites
produced the light, the wakeful god for the god.'

<span id="fn_646"></span>[256:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_648.md) Professor Weber,
Ind. Stud. VIII, p. 42, refers to a parallel passage in Tâ*nd*ya-Br.
VII, 4, 7--'By means of the Bahishpavamâna (of the morning service) the
gods carried off Âditya, the sun, to heaven; but he did not stop there.
At midday they then fixed him by means of the B*ri*hatî, and for this
reason the B*ri*hatî metre is used for the Pavamâna-stotra at the midday
service.'

<span id="fn_647"></span>[256:2](sbe44070.htm#fr_649.md) Literally,
sharpeners or sharpenings (sa*ms*âna).

<span id="fn_648"></span>[256:3](sbe44070.htm#fr_650.md) These
words--apparently meaning 'for fame all round, for fame far and wide,
for true fame, for fame' (or, perhaps, for hearing, or, rather, being
heard of all round,' &c.)--are used to form the *finales* (nidhana) in
which all the priests are to join; cf. Sâmav., Calc. ed., I, pp. 533-4,
where the figured text is given. According to Katy. XIX, 5, 4-5; Lâ*t*y.
V, 4, 19, the words, 'sa*mg*ityai, vi*g*ityai, satya*g*ityai, *g*ityai'
(for complete victory, victory far and wide, &c.), and 'sampush*t*yai,
vipush*t*yai,' &c. (for complete prosperity, &c.), are to be used
instead, in the case of a Kshatriya and Vai*s*ya respectively, either
optionally or necessarily. Though these four words are here, and
elsewhere, spoken of as so many different Sâmans, only 'the last of them
('*s*ravase') forms the *finale* of a Sâman in the ordinary sense of the
word; the others being merely combined with certain musical
ejaculations, or expletives (stobhas). All the four 'Sâmans' begin with
the same phrase (varying only in the verb)--'sa*m* tvâ hinvanti
(ri*n*anti, <span id="page_257">p. 257</span> tatakshur, *s*i*s*anti)
dhîtibhi*h*,' i, e. 'they make thee up (or urge thee on) with prayers,'
serving as a kind of prelude (prastâva) the single words of which are
given among the Stobhas (Sâmav„ Calc. ed., II, p. 522, last line), as,
indeed, the words 'sa*ms*ravase,' &c., themselves are (ib., p. 520). In
the first three Sâmans this phrase is followed by the *finale*
consisting of the respective characteristic word preceded by the Stobha
'auhovâ.' In the last Sâman, on the other hand, the introductory phrase
is followed by the choral setting of the verse 'B*ri*had indrâya gâyata'
(see [p. 255](#page_255), n. [2](#fn_645).md), which, in its turn, is
followed again by the first phrase, with a slightly modified modulation,
ending with 'auhovâ *s*ravase.' Whilst joining in the *finale*, the
priests, according to Lâ*t*y. V, 4, 17, are to lay their hands on the
head of the Sacrificer.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[257:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_652.md) According to Katy.
Sr. XIX, 4, 24; 5, 8 seq.; 7, 1 seq., the thirty-third libation of gravy
is taken with the text, XX, 32, 'yo bhûtânâm adhipati*h* (he who is the
over-lord of creatures),' &c.; whilst, on the conclusion of the Sastra,
or Hot*ri*'s recitation, the Sacrificer offers the libation from that
last cup with XX, 11-12, and drinks the remainder with XX, 13. The
Sastra, recited in response to the Sâman, consists of the section of
.eleven verses, Vâ*g*. S. XX, 80-90, the first and last verses of which
are recited thrice; whilst the 'âhâva' (*s*o*m*sâvom, 'let us praise,
om!') is inserted by him before each triplet of the remaining nine
verses. The two verses used whilst the Sacrificer offers (XX, 11-12) are
likewise recited by the <span id="page_258">p. 258</span> Hot*ri*, as a
'nivid,' being either added at the end of the Sastra, or inserted before
the ninth or tenth verse; the whole recitation thus consisting of
seventeen verses.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[258:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_653.md) Mahîdhara takes
the instrumental throughout as a sociative (saha satyena).

<span id="fn_651"></span>[259:1](sbe44070.htm#fr_654.md) According to Kâty.
XIX, 5, 9, the priests themselves first smell the remainder of the fat
gravy, with the text (XX, 34), 'The protector of my breath thou art,'
&c. Cf. also [XIV, 2, 2, 42](sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:42.md), with note.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[259:2](sbe44070.htm#fr_655.md) The use of
'prayati' in this sense (here and Vâ*g*. S. XVIII, 1) is peculiar; being
apparently derived from 'pra-yam,' one would expect it to have some such
meaning as 'offer, gift.' This and the other predicates, according to
Mahîdhara, are to show the state of feeling of beings towards the
(royal) Sacrificer. The repetition of 'ânati' (bowing, prostration,
submission) is strange. A strong alliterative cadence is noticeable in
the verse.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[259:3](sbe44070.htm#fr_656.md) ? Hardly 'return'
here; rather, perhaps, 'attaining to (the other worlds),' or, possibly,
'the turning to him, gathering round him (of the people).'

<span id="fn_654"></span>[259:4](sbe44070.htm#fr_657.md) ? Or, he now calls
these to himself in the meantime.
