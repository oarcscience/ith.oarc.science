### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:3:1">13:8:3:1</span></span>1. He
then sows (seed) of all (kinds of) herbs: what the all-herb (seed
signified) on that occasion <span id="fr_1155"></span>[3](#fn_1147.md),
that (it does) here. With many (verses <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[4](#fn_1148).md) he sows

<span id="page_433">p. 433</span>

that (former seed), with a single one this,--he thus keeps the divine
separate from what belongs to the Fathers,--with <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[1](#fn_1149.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:3:2">13:8:3:2</span></span>2. He
then pours out that (jarful of bones <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[2](#fn_1150).md); for this earth is the foundation: on
this (earth), as a foundation, he thus establishes him. Before sunrise
(he does so), for, in secret, as it were, are the Fathers, and in
secret, as it were, is the night;--in secret, indeed, he does this,
(but) so that (the sun) should rise over him doing it: on both day and
night he thus establishes him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:3:3">13:8:3:3</span></span>3. \[He
does so, with Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 5-6,\] 'May Savit*ri* deposit thy bones in
the mother's lap,'--Savit*ri* thus deposits his bones in the lap of the
mother, this earth;--'O Earth, be thou propitious unto him!' he thus
says this in order that this (earth) may be propitious to him.--'In the
deity Pra*g*âpati I place thee, in the world nigh unto the water <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[3](#fn_1151.md), O N.N.,' therewith he mentions the
name (of the deceased); for nigh to

<span id="page_434">p. 434</span>

the water, indeed, is this (terrestrial) world: he thus places him in
the deity Pra*g*âpati, in the world nigh unto the water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:3:4">13:8:3:4</span></span>4. He
then says to some one, 'Proceed in that (southern) direction without
drawing breath, and, having thrown down the jar, return hither without
looking behind thee!' He then mutters (Vâ*g*. S. XXXV, 7), 'O Death, go
away another way, what second way there is of thine other than the path
of the gods <span id="fr_1160"></span>[1](#fn_1152.md); I call unto thee
that hast eyes and hearest: hurt not our family nor our men!' for long
life he thereby prays for these, and accordingly each subsequent one of
them dies of old age.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:3:5">13:8:3:5</span></span>5. He
then arranges him (the dead man) limb by limb, with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXV,
8-9), 'Propitious be the wind unto thee, propitious the heat of the sun;
propitious be the bricks; propitious be the fires unto thee, and may the
earthly ones not scorch thee!--May the regions fit themselves to thee,
and may the waters be most kind unto thee, and the rivers; and kind.
also the air: may all the regions fit themselves to thee!'--he thereby
makes everything fit itself to him, and be auspicious for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:3:6">13:8:3:6</span></span>6. Now
thirteen unmarked <span id="fr_1161"></span>[2](#fn_1153.md) bricks,
measuring a foot (square), have been made: they are just like those
bricks in the fire-altar. Those (altar bricks) he lays down with a
formula, silently these: he thus keeps the divine separate from what
belongs to the Fathers.

<span id="page_435">p. 435</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:3:7">13:8:3:7</span></span>7.
There are thirteen of them,--thirteen months are a year: on the seasons,
on the year, he thus establishes him, as on a firm foundation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:3:8">13:8:3:8</span></span>8. They
measure a foot (square),--the foot is a foundation: a foundation he thus
prepares for him. Unmarked they are, for in secret, as it were, are the
Fathers; and in secret, as it were, is what is unmarked: he thus
secretes what is in secret.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:3:9">13:8:3:9</span></span>9. One
of them he places in the middle, with the front side towards the east:
this is the body (trunk);--three in front, fitted to (the position of)
the head: that is the head;--three on the right; that is the right wing
(side);--three on the left: that is the left wing;--three behind: that
is the tail. Thus this his body, furnished with wings and tail, is just
like that of Agni (the fire-altar).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:3:10">13:8:3:10</span></span>10.
He then bids them bring some soil from a cleft in the ground, for thus
the Fathers’ (share) in this (earth) is not excessive; and he also
thereby makes the (dead man's) sin to be restricted <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[1](#fn_1154.md). And some, now, dig in that
intermediate (south-eastern) quarter, and fetch it from there; and
others, again, do so towards the south-west, and fetch it northwards
from there: he may do as he chooses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:3:11">13:8:3:11</span></span>11.
Let him not make it (the sepulchral mound) too large, lest he make the
(deceased's) sin large. For a Kshatriya he may make it as high as a man
with upstretched arms, for a Brâhma*n*a reaching up to the mouth, for a
woman up to the hips, for a Vai*s*ya up to the thighs, for a *S*ûdra up
to the knee; for suchlike is their vigour.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:3:12">13:8:3:12</span></span>12.
But let him rather make it so as to reach

<span id="page_436">p. 436</span>

below the knee: he thus leaves no room for another. While that (mound)
is being made, they hold a bundle (of reed grass) to the left (north,
uttarata*h*) of it,--that is offspring: they thus hold the (deceased's)
offspring upwards (uttarata*h*). Do not let him throw it down either
after holding it up, or after bringing it; but let him set it up in the
house <span id="fr_1163"></span>[1](#fn_1155.md): he thus sets up offspring
in the house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:8:3:13">13:8:3:13</span></span>13.
Having prepared it, he sows barley grain (yava), thinking, 'May they
ward off (yavaya) sin from me!' He covers it over with
Avakâ-plants <span id="fr_1164"></span>[2](#fn_1156.md) in order that there
may be joy (or moisture, ka) for him; and with Darbha grass (Poa
cynosuroides) he covers it for the sake of softness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1147"></span>[432:3](sbe44115.htm#fr_1155.md) Viz. that it
means food of every kind, see VII, 2, 4, 14.

<span id="fn_1148"></span>[432:4](sbe44115.htm#fr_1156.md) Viz. with
fifteen verses (VII, 2, 4, 15 seqq.) of which the one here used formed
part (part iii, p. 340, note 2, verse,).

<span id="fn_1149"></span>[433:1](sbe44115.htm#fr_1157.md) That is, they
die of old age; just as do the herbs now sown to which the verse is, of
course, addressed in the first place. Cf. Mahîdhara on Vâ*g*. S. XII,
79.

<span id="fn_1150"></span>[433:2](sbe44115.htm#fr_1158.md) On burning the
dead body, immediately after death, the calcined bones were carefully
collected and kept in an earthen vessel; cf. [p.
117](sbe44036.htm#page_117), note [3](sbe44036.htm#fn_361.md).

<span id="fn_1151"></span>[433:3](sbe44115.htm#fr_1159.md) Or, in a place
near water. The Sa*m*hitâ adds (either before or after the dead man's
name), 'May he (Pra*g*âpati) burn away our sin!'

<span id="fn_1152"></span>[434:1](sbe44115.htm#fr_1160.md) Viz. the
'pit*ri*yâna,' or path of the Fathers. See I, 9, 3, 2.

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[434:2](sbe44115.htm#fr_1161.md) That is, not
marked with lines, as those of the fire-altar are. As to the use of
pebbles, instead of bricks, in the case of one who has not performed the
Agni*k*ayana, see [XIII, 8, 4, 11](sbe44116.htm#13:8:4:11.md).

<span id="fn_1154"></span>[435:1](sbe44115.htm#fr_1162.md) See [XIII, 8, 1,
15](sbe44113.htm#13:8:1:15.md).

<span id="fn_1155"></span>[436:1](sbe44115.htm#fr_1163.md) That is, fix it
so as to stand upright, by means of a bambû stick to which it is tied.
Cf. Kâty. XXI, 3, 27 comm.

<span id="fn_1156"></span>[436:2](sbe44115.htm#fr_1164.md) Blyxa (or
Vallisneria) octandra (Roxburghii), a grass-like plant with sword-shaped
leaves (A. K. Nairne, The Flowering Plants of Western India, p, 318),
growing freely on the margins of tanks. Cf. VII, 5, 1, 11; IX, 1, 2, 22
(where read 'Avakâ-plant' instead of 'lotus-flower').
