Forty-eight (oblations) he offers;--the <I>G</I>agat&icirc; consists of forty-eight syllables, and cattle are of <I>G</I>&acirc;gata (movable) nature: by means of the <I>G</I>agat&icirc; he (the Adhvaryu) thus wins cattle for him (the Sacrificer). One additional (oblation) he offers, whence one man is apt to thrive amongst (many) creatures (or subjects).</p>
