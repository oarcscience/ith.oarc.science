# *S*ATAPATHA-BRÂHMA*N*A.

## ELEVENTH KÂ*ND*A.

#### THE FULL AND NEW-MOON SACRIFICE.

### FIRST ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:1:1">11:1:1:1</span></span>1.
Verily, Pra*g*âpati, the Sacrifice, is the Year: the night of new moon
is its gate, and the moon itself is the bolt of the gate.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:1:2">11:1:1:2</span></span>2. And
when one lays down the two fires at new moon <span
id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69),--even as one would enter a stronghold by
the gate, when the gate is open, and would thence reach the world of
heaven, so it is when one lays down the fires at new moon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:1:3">11:1:1:3</span></span>2. And
if one lays down the fires under a (special) asterism <span
id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_70),--just as if one tried to enter a
stronghold, when the gate is closed, in some other way than through the
gate, and failed to get inside the stronghold, so it is when one lays
down the fires under an asterism: let him therefore not lay down the
fires under an asterism.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:1:4">11:1:1:4</span></span>4. On
the same day on which that one (the moon) should not be seen either in
the east or in the west,

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

let him fast, for it is then that he (the moon) comes to this
world <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71), and on that (day) he abides
here (on the sacrificial ground).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:1:5">11:1:1:5</span></span>5. And
all the gods abide (here), all the spirits, all the deities, all the
seasons, all the Stomas (hymn-forms), all the P*ri*sh*th*as <span
id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_72), and all the metres.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:1:6">11:1:1:6</span></span>6. And,
verily, it is for all the gods, for all spirits, for all deities, for
all seasons, for all Stomas, for all P*ri*sh*th*as, and for all metres
that the fires of him are laid down who lays them down at new moon: he
should therefore lay them down at new moon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:1:7">11:1:1:7</span></span>7. He
may lay down the fires on the new moon which falls in the (month)
Vai*s*âkha, for that coincides with the Rohi*n*î (asterism); for the
Rohi*n*î means the self, offspring and cattle <span
id="fr_73"></span>[3](#fn_73): he thus becomes established in a self, in
offspring and cattle. But, indeed, the new moon is the form of the
Agnyâdheya: let him therefore lay down the fires at new moon;--let him
perform the preliminary ceremony <span id="fr_74"></span>[4](#fn_74) at
full moon, and the initiation ceremony at new moon.
