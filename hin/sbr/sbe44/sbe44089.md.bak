### SEVENTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:1">13:2:7:1</span></span>1. When
the victims have been bound (to the stakes), the Adhvaryu takes the
sprinkling-water in order to sprinkle the horse. Whilst the Sacrificer
holds on to him behind, he (in sprinkling the horse) runs rapidly
through the formula used at the Soma-sacrifice <span
id="fr_808"></span>[2](#fn_804.md), and then commences the one for the
A*s*vamedha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:2">13:2:7:2</span></span>2.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 13,\] 'May Vâyu favour thee with cooked kinds of
food <span id="fr_809"></span>[3](#fn_805),'--Vâyu (the wind.md) indeed
cooks it <span id="fr_810"></span>[4](#fn_806.md);--'the dark-necked one
with he-goats,'--the dark-necked one, doubtless,

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

is Agni (the fire); and the fire indeed cooks it (the horse) together
with the he-goats.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:3">13:2:7:3</span></span>3. 'The
Nyagrodha with cups,'--for when the gods were performing sacrifice, they
tilted over those Soma-cups, and, turned downwards, they took root,
whence the Nyagrodhas (ficus indica), when turned downwards (nya*k*),
take root (roha <span id="fr_811"></span>[1](#fn_807).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:4">13:2:7:4</span></span>4. 'The
cotton-tree with growth,'--he confers growth on the cotton-tree
(salmalia malabarica), whence the cotton-tree grows largest amongst
trees <span id="fr_812"></span>[2](#fn_808.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:5">13:2:7:5</span></span>5.
'This male, fit for the chariot,'--he supplies the chariot with a horse,
whence the horse draws nothing else than a chariot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:6">13:2:7:6</span></span>6.
'Hath come hither on his four feet,'--therefore the horse, when
standing, stands on three feet, but, when harnessed, it pulls with all
its feet at one and the same time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:7">13:2:7:7</span></span>7. 'May
the spotless Brahman protect us!'--the spotless <span
id="fr_813"></span>[3](#fn_809) Brahman (m..md), doubtless, is the moon:

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

to the moon he thus commits it;--'Reverence to Agni!'--to Agni he thus
makes reverence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:8">13:2:7:8</span></span>8.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 14,\] 'Trimmed up is the car with the cord,'--with
cord one indeed completes the car <span id="fr_814"></span>[1](#fn_810.md),
whence a car, when enveloped (with cords <span
id="fr_815"></span>[2](#fn_811).md), is very handsome.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:9">13:2:7:9</span></span>9.
'Trimmed up is the steed with the rein,'--with the rein one indeed
completes the horse, whence the horse, when curbed by the rein, looks
most beautiful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:10">13:2:7:10</span></span>10.
'Trimmed up in the waters was the water-born,'--the horse, indeed, has
sprung from the womb of the waters <span
id="fr_816"></span>[3](#fn_812): with its own (mother's.md) womb he thus
supplies it;--'Brahman (m.), with Soma for his leader,'--he thus makes
it go to heaven with Soma for its leader.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:11">13:2:7:11</span></span>11.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 15,1 'Thyself, fit out thy body, O racer,'--'Take
thyself the form which thou wishest,' he thereby says to him;--'make
offering thyself,'--sovereign rule (independence) he thereby confers on
it;--'rejoice thou thyself,'--'enjoy (rule) thou thyself the world as
far as thou wishest,' he thereby says to him;--'thy glory is not to be
equalled by any one!'--with glory he thereby endows the horse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:12">13:2:7:12</span></span>12.
\[Vâ*g*: S. XXIII, 16 <span id="fr_817"></span>[4](#fn_813.md),\] 'Thou
shalt not die

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

here, neither suffer harm,'--he thereby cheers it;--'on easy paths thou
goest to the gods,'--he thereby shows him the paths leading to the
gods;--'where dwell the pious, whither they have gone,'--he thereby
makes it one who shares the same world with the pious;--'thither the god
Savit*ri* shall lead thee,'--it is, indeed, Savit*ri* that leads him to
the heavenly world.--Whilst whispering <span
id="fr_818"></span>[1](#fn_814.md) 'I sprinkle thee, acceptable unto
Pra*g*âpati,' he then holds (the sprinkling water) under (its mouth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:13">13:2:7:13</span></span>13.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 17,\] 'Agni was an animal; they sacrificed him, and
he gained that world wherein Agni (ruleth): that shall be thy world,
that thou shalt gain,--drink thou this water!'--'As great as Agni's
conquest was, as great as is his world, as great as is his lordship, so
great shall be thy conquest, so great thy world, so great thy lordship,'
this is what he thereby says to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:14">13:2:7:14</span></span>14.
'Vâyu was an animal; they sacrificed him, and he gained that world
wherein. Vâyu (ruleth): that shall be thy world, that thou shalt
gain,--drink thou this water!'--'As great as Vâyu's conquest was, as
great as is his world, as great as is his lordship, so great shall be
thy conquest, so great thy world, so great thy lordship,' this is what
he thereby says to him.

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:7:15">13:2:7:15</span></span>15.
'Sûrya was an animal; they sacrificed him, and he gained that world
wherein Sûrya (ruleth): that shall be thy world, that thou shalt
gain,--drink thou this water!'--'As great as Sûrya's conquest was, as
great as is his world, as great as is his lordship, so great shall be
thy conquest, so great thy world, so great thy lordship,' this is what
he thereby says to him. Having satisfied the horse, and consecrated
again the sprinkling water, he sprinkles the other victims: thereof
hereafter.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_803"></span>[316:1](sbe44088.htm#fr_807.md) Here the original
text in Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 12, has simply 'the pi*s*aṅgilâ was the night.'
Mahîdhara explains 'pi*s*aṅgilâ' by 'pi*s*a*m*gila,' 'beauty-devouring,'
inasmuch as the night swallows, or conceals, all beauty (or form).
Neither this nor the other explanation (= pi*s*aṅga, ruddy-brown) suits
the day; but Harisvâmin, who does not explain the name, remarks that the
night here is taken to include the day. Cf. [XIII, 5, 2,
18](sbe44107.htm#13:5:2:18.md).

<span id="fn_804"></span>[316:2](sbe44089.htm#fr_808.md) Viz. Vâ*g*. S. VI,
9; see III, 7, 4, 4-5.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[316:3](sbe44089.htm#fr_809.md) The author seems
to take 'pa*k*atai*h*' in the sense of 'cooking.'

<span id="fn_806"></span>[316:4](sbe44089.htm#fr_810.md) Viz. inasmuch as
it causes the fire to blaze up, comm.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[317:1](sbe44089.htm#fr_811.md) Or, whence the
Nyagrodhas grow downwards. This refers to the habit of the Indian
fig-tree, of sending down from the branches numerous slender roots which
afterwards become fresh stems. Cp. the corresponding legend in Ait. Br.
VII, 30, told there by way of explaining why Kshatriyas, being forbidden
to drink Soma, should drink the juice extracted from the descending
roots of the Indian fig-tree. Another reason why the Indian fig-tree
(also called 'va*t*a') is here connected with the priests’ Soma-cups
(*k*amasa), is that this is one of the kinds of wood used in making
those cups (cf. Katy, I, 3, 36 comm.).

<span id="fn_808"></span>[317:2](sbe44089.htm#fr_812.md) According to
Stewart and Brandis, Forest Flora, p. 31, the cotton-tree (or
silk-cotton tree) is a very large tree of rapid growth, attaining a
height of 150 ft., and a girth of 40 ft.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[317:3](sbe44089.htm#fr_813.md) Lit. 'the
non-black Brahman,' explained as one who has no black spots; though it
is difficult to see why the moon should be favoured with this epithet.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[318:1](sbe44089.htm#fr_814.md) In Indian vehicles
the different parts are held together by cords. For a drawing see Sir H.
M. Elliot, The Races of the N.W. Provinces. of India, II, p. 342. The
word for 'cord' and 'rein' is the same in Sanskrit.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[318:2](sbe44089.htm#fr_815.md) Paryuta*h* =
parivesh*t*ito ra*gg*ubhi*h*, comm.; hardly 'hung all round (with
ornaments),' as the St. Petersb. Dict. takes it.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[318:3](sbe44089.htm#fr_816.md) See V, 1, 4, 5;
VI, 1, 1, 11.

<span id="fn_813"></span>[318:4](sbe44089.htm#fr_817.md) The first two
pâdas of this verse form the first half-verse of *Ri*g-veda S. I, 162,
21.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[319:1](sbe44089.htm#fr_818.md) Cp. I, 4, 5, 12:
'Hence whatever at the sacrifice is performed for Pra*g*âpati, that is
performed in a low voice (under the breath); for speech would not act as
oblation-bearer for Pra*g*âpati.' Pra*g*âpati, as representing
generation, is often spoken of as 'undefined' or 'unexpressed (secret)';
and so is what is muttered in a low voice.
