### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:2:1">12:4:2:1</span></span>1. They
also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-cow were to milk blood, what rite and
what expiation would there be in that case?' Let him say 'Disperse!' and
having made a stirring-spoon, let him order the Anvâhârya-pa*k*ana fire
to be enclosed; and having boiled that (blood) thereon, let him silently
offer it in an undefined (indistinct) way <span
id="fr_514"></span>[1](#fn_514.md), for Pra*g*âpati is undefined, and the
Agnihotra is sacred to Pra*g*âpati; and the undefined also means
everything: he thus makes atonement with everything. At this offering he
should give that (cow) to a Brâhma*n*a whom he does not intend to visit;
for, indeed, she who milks blood milks it after perceiving the
Sacrificer's suffering and evil: he thus fastens that suffering and evil
upon this (Brâhma*n*a). Let him then make offering with what other milk
he can procure: by that which is not unsound he thus throws out what is
unsound in the sacrifice. This, then, is the rite performed in that
case.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:2:2">12:4:2:2</span></span>2. They
also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to become impure <span
id="fr_515"></span>[2](#fn_515.md) whilst being milked, what rite and what
expiation would there be in that case?' Now some think that it should be
offered

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (arguing that) it
is ready (for offering), and it would be improper if it were not
offered; and that the gods have no loathing for anything. But the gods
have indeed loathings:--let him rather proceed in the following way.
Having shifted some hot cinders from the Gârhapatya, let him silently
pour that (milk) on these hot cinders. He then pours water thereon, and
thus secures (âp) it by means of the water (âp). Let him then make
offering with what other (milk) he can procure. This, then, is the rite
performed in that case.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:2:3">12:4:2:3</span></span>3. They
also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to become impure after he
has had it milked, what rite and what expiation would there be in that
case?' Let him shift back the coals which were shifted away (from the
fire) and on which he was going to put (the Agnihotra-milk); and let him
then pour it silently on these hot cinders. He then pours water thereon,
and secures it by means of the water. Let him then make offering with
what other (milk) he can procure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:2:4">12:4:2:4</span></span>4. They
also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to become impure after being
put on the fire, what rite and what expiation would there be in that
case?' Let him offer it silently on the coals which were shifted away
(from the fire), and on which it had been placed: thus it is both
offered and not offered; for inasmuch as he offers it on those (hot
coals) it is offered, and inasmuch as he extinguishes it along with them
it is not offered. He pours water thereon, and secures it by means of
the water. Let him then make offering with what other (milk) he can
procure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:2:5">12:4:2:5</span></span>5. They
also say, 'If the Sacrificer were to die

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

when the Agnihotra-milk has been put on the fire, what rite and what
expiation would there be in that case?' Having enclosed it, let him pour
it out: and such, indeed, they say, is the expiation (in that case) for
every Havirya*gñ*a. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:2:6">12:4:2:6</span></span>6. They
also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to be spilled after being
ladled out into the offering-spoon, what rite and what expiation would
there be in that case?' Let him touch it with the (formula of) atonement
for spilling, and, having poured water thereon, let him make offering
with what (milk) there is left. And if the spoon be turned upside down,
or if it were to break, let him touch (the spilled milk) with the
(formula of) atonement for spilling, and, having poured water thereon,
let him make offering with what (milk) is left in the pot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:2:7">12:4:2:7</span></span>7. Now
some go back (to the Gârhapatya) and make offering with what (milk) is
left in the pot; but let him not do this, for, indeed, that Agnihotra is
conducive to heaven, and if any one, in that case, were to say of him,
'Surely, this one has descended again from the heavenly world: this
(offering) will be in no wise conducive to heaven for him,' then that
would indeed be likely to come to pass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:2:8">12:4:2:8</span></span>8. Let
him rather do it in this way:--let him sit down there and then, and let
them ladle out and bring to him what (milk) there is left in the pot.
Now some perplex him, saying, 'Surely, this (milk) is the remainder of
an offering; surely, this is exhausted: offering should not be made
thereof;' but let him give no heed to this; for, surely, when that
(milk) is of unexhausted strength it is used for

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

curdling the offering-material <span id="fr_516"></span>[1](#fn_516.md):
let them therefore ladle out and bring to him what (milk) there is left
in the pot; and if there should not be any in it, let him put on the
fire what other (milk) he can procure; and when he has made the light
fall on it <span id="fr_517"></span>[2](#fn_517.md), and poured water to
it, and taken it off (the fire),--then on that (former) occasion <span
id="fr_518"></span>[3](#fn_518) he (the Adhvaryu.md) says, 'I will ladle
out <span id="fr_519"></span>[4](#fn_519.md);' but on the present occasion
let them ladle it out in the way it is (there) ladled out and bring it
to him; and let him by all means make offering therewith. This, then, is
the rite performed in that case.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:2:9">12:4:2:9</span></span>9. They
also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to become impure after it
has been ladled into the offering-spoon, what rite and what expiation
would there be in that case?' Now some think it should be offered, on
the ground that it is ready (for offering), and it would be improper if
it were not offered, for the gods have no loathing for anything. And
some fill it to overflowing and let it flow off <span
id="fr_520"></span>[5](#fn_520.md); but let him not do this; for if, in
that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (priest) has poured
away the Agnihotra: this Sacrificer will be poured away,' then that
would indeed be likely to come to pass. Let him rather do it in this
way:--let him put

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

fuel on the Âhavanîya, and, having shifted some hot cinders away from
the Âhavanîya, let him silently pour it on these hot cinders. He then
pours water on it, and secures it by means of the water; and let him
then make offering with what other (milk) he can procure. This, then, is
the rite performed in that case.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:2:10">12:4:2:10</span></span>10.
They also say, 'If it were to rain upon (uparish*t*ât) any one's
Agnihotra-milk when it has been ladled into the offering-spoon, what
rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Let him know,
'Light (or sap) has come to me from above (uparish*t*ât); the gods have
helped me: I shall become more glorious;' and let him by all means make
offering therewith. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_514"></span>[183:1](sbe44059.htm#fr_514.md) According to Kâty.
XXV, 2, 2, it is to be offered on hot cinders of the Dakshi*n*âgni with
the formula, 'To Rudra, hail!'

<span id="fn_515"></span>[183:2](sbe44059.htm#fr_515.md) Or rather,
perhaps,--if anything impure were to get (to fall) into any one's
Agnihotra-milk; cf. [XII, 4, 2, 9](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:9.md).

<span id="fn_516"></span>[186:1](sbe44059.htm#fr_516.md) Literally, they
make it the means of curdling the havis;--cf. [XI, 1, 4,
1](sbe44006.htm#11:1:4:1.md), where the sour milk from last night's milking
is so used. In the same way the milk not used for the Agnihotra might
have served for curdling next morning's milk.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[186:2](sbe44059.htm#fr_517.md) Viz. by means of a
lighted straw, cf. II, 3, 1, 16.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[186:3](sbe44059.htm#fr_518.md) Viz. at the
evening-offering of the Agnihotra; the Sacrificer then replying, 'Om,
ladle out!' At the morning-offering the Adhvaryu says, 'I ladle out,'
instead. Cf. part i, p. 331, note 1.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[186:4](sbe44059.htm#fr_519.md) Or, 'shall I ladle
out?' as the Paddhati on Kâty. IV, 14, 8 takes it.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[186:5](sbe44059.htm#fr_520.md) That is to say,
they let the impure matter flow off.
