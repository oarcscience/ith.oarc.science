### SIXTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:1:1">11:6:1:1</span></span>1. Now,
Bh*ri*gu, the son of Varu*n*a, deemed himself superior to his father
Varu*n*a in knowledge <span id="fr_347"></span>[3](#fn_347). Varu*n*a
became aware of this: 'He deems himself superior to me in knowledge,' he
thought.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:1:2">11:6:1:2</span></span>2. He
said, 'Go thou eastward, my boy; and

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

having seen there what thou shalt see, go thou southwards; and having
seen there what thou shalt see, go thou westward; and having seen there
what thou shalt see, go thou northward; and having seen there what thou
shalt see, go thou toward the northern of those two intermediate
quarters in front <span id="fr_348"></span>[1](#fn_348), and tell me
then what thou shalt see there.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:1:3">11:6:1:3</span></span>3. He
then went forth from thence eastward, and lo, men were dismembering
men <span id="fr_349"></span>[2](#fn_349), hewing off their limbs one by
one, and saying, 'This to thee, this to me!' He said, 'Horrible! woe is
me! men here have dismembered men, hewing off their limbs one by one!'
They replied, 'Thus, indeed, these dealt with us in yonder world, and so
we now deal with them in return.' He said, 'Is there no atonement for
this?'--'Yes, there is,' they replied.--'What is it?'--'Thy father
knows.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:1:4">11:6:1:4</span></span>4. He
went forth from thence southward, and lo, men were dismembering men,
cutting up their limbs one by one, and saying, 'This to thee, this to
me!' He said, 'Horrible! woe is me! men here have dismembered men,
cutting up their limbs one by one!' They replied, 'Thus, indeed, these
dealt with us in yonder world, and so we now deal with them in return.'
He said, 'Is there no atonement for this?'--'Yes, there is,' they
replied.--'What is it?'--'Thy father knows.'

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:1:5">11:6:1:5</span></span>5. He
went forth from thence westward, and lo, men, sitting still, were being
eaten by men, sitting still! He said, 'Horrible! woe is me! men, sitting
still, are eating men, sitting still!' They replied, 'Thus, indeed,
these have dealt with us in yonder world, and so we now deal with them
in return.' He said, 'Is there no atonement for this? Yes, there is,'
they replied.--'What is it? Thy father knows.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:1:6">11:6:1:6</span></span>6. He
went forth from thence northward, and lo, men, crying aloud, were being
eaten by men, crying aloud! He said, 'Horrible! woe is me! men, crying
aloud, here are eating men, crying aloud!' They replied, 'Thus, indeed,
these dealt with us in yonder world, and so we now deal with them in
return.' He said, 'Is there no atonement for this?'--'Yes, there is,'
they replied.--'What is it? Thy father knows.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:1:7">11:6:1:7</span></span>7. He
went forth from thence toward the northern of those two intermediate
quarters in front, and lo, there were two women, one beautiful, one
over-beautiful <span id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_350): between them stood
a man, black, with yellow eyes, and a staff in his hand. On seeing him,
terror seized him, and he went home, and sat down. His father said to
him, 'Study thy day's lesson (of scripture): why dost thou not, study
thy lesson?' He said, What am I to study? there is nothing whatever.'
Then Varu*n*a knew, 'He has indeed seen it!

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:1:8">11:6:1:8</span></span>8. He
spake, ‘As to those men whom thou

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

sawest in the eastern region being dismembered by men hewing off their
limbs one by one, and saying, "This to thee, this to me!" they were the
trees: when one puts fire-wood from trees on (the fire) he subdues the
trees, and conquers the world of trees.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:1:9">11:6:1:9</span></span>9. ‘And
as to those men whom thou sawest in the southern region being
dismembered by men cutting up their limbs one by one, and saying, "This
to thee, this to me!" they were the cattle; when one makes offering with
milk he subdues the cattle, and conquers the world of cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:1:10">11:6:1:10</span></span>10.
‘And as to those men thou sawest in the western region who, whilst
sitting still, were being eaten by men sitting still, they were the
herbs: when one illumines (the Agnihotra milk) with a straw <span
id="fr_351"></span>[1](#fn_351), he subdues the herbs, and conquers the
world of herbs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:1:11">11:6:1:11</span></span>11.
‘And as to those men thou sawest in the northern region who, whilst
crying aloud, were being eaten by men crying aloud, they were the
waters: when one pours water to (the Agnihotra milk), he subdues the
waters, and conquers the world of waters.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:1:12">11:6:1:12</span></span>12.
‘And as to those two women whom thou sawest, one beautiful and one
over-beautiful,--the beautiful one is Belief: when one offers the first
libation (of the Agnihotra) he subdues Belief, and conquers Belief; and
the over-beautiful one is Unbelief: when one offers the second libation,
he subdues Unbelief, and conquers Unbelief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:1:13">11:6:1:13</span></span>13.
'And as to the black man with yellow eyes,

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

who was standing between them with a staff in his hand, he was Wrath:
when, having poured water into the spoon, one pours (the libation into
the fire), he subdues Wrath, and conquers Wrath; and, verily, whosoever,
knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, thereby conquers everything, and
subdues everything.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_347"></span>[108:3](sbe44034.htm#fr_347) On this legend,
see Prof. Weber, Indische Streifen, I, p. 24 seqq., where the scenes
here depicted are taken to be reflections of the popular belief of the
time as to the punishments awaiting the guilty in a future existence.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[109:1](sbe44034.htm#fr_348) That is to say, in
the north-easterly direction. Prof. Weber seems to take it in the sense
of the northern one of the two regions intermediate between the two
(regions) first referred to. This, however, makes no sense.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[109:2](sbe44034.htm#fr_349) I think, with
Prof. Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 404, that the instrumental
'purushai*h*' stands in lieu of the accusative; this construction being
adopted in order to avoid the double accusative and consequent
ambiguity.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[110:1](sbe44034.htm#fr_350) According to
Sâya*n*a 'ati-kalyâ*n*î' means 'not beautiful (a*s*obhanâ), ugly.'
Perhaps its real meaning is 'one of past beauty,' one whose beauty has
faded.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[111:1](sbe44034.htm#fr_351) See II, 3, 1, 16.
