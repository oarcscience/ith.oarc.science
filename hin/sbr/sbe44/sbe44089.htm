<P><A NAME="fn_803"></A><A HREF="sbe44088.htm#fr_807">316:1</A> Here the original text in V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXIII, 12, has simply 'the pi<I>s</I>a&#7749;gil&acirc; was the night.' Mah&icirc;dhara explains 'pi<I>s</I>a&#7749;gil&acirc;' by 'pi<I>s</I>a<I>m</I>gila,' 'beauty-devouring,' inasmuch as the night swallows, or conceals, all beauty (or form). Neither this nor the other explanation (= pi<I>s</I>a&#7749;ga, ruddy-brown) suits the day; but Harisv&acirc;min, who does not explain the name, remarks that the night here is taken to include the day.

<P><A NAME="fn_807"></A><A HREF="sbe44089.htm#fr_811">317:1</A> Or, whence the Nyagrodhas grow downwards. This refers to the habit of the Indian fig-tree, of sending down from the branches numerous slender roots which afterwards become fresh stems. Cp. the corresponding legend in Ait. Br. VII, 30, told there by way of explaining why Kshatriyas, being forbidden to drink Soma, should drink the juice extracted from the descending roots of the Indian fig-tree. Another reason why the Indian fig-tree (also called 'va<I>t</I>a') is here connected with the priests&#8217; Soma-cups (<I>k</I>amasa), is that this is one of the kinds of wood used in making those cups (cf. Katy, I, 3, 36 comm.).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_808"></A><A HREF="sbe44089.htm#fr_812">317:2</A> According to Stewart and Brandis, Forest Flora, p. 31, the cotton-tree (or silk-cotton tree) is a very large tree of rapid growth, attaining a height of 150 ft., and a girth of 40 ft.</P>

Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, as representing generation, is often spoken of as 'undefined' or 'unexpressed (secret)'; and so is what is muttered in a low voice.</P>
