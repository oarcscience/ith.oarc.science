### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:2:1">11:1:2:1</span></span>1. Now
when they spread (and perform) the sacrifice, they kill it; and when
they press out king Soma, they kill him; and when they 'quiet' and cut
up the victim, they kill it,--it is by means of the mortar and pestle,
and by the two mill-stones that they kill the Havirya*gñ*a
(grain-offering).

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:2:2">11:1:2:2</span></span>2. And
having killed the sacrifice, he pours it, as seed, into the fire as its
womb, for, indeed, the fire is the womb of the sacrifice, from out of
it it is produced: let him therefore perform those ten oblations <span
id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md) for which the Vasha*t* is uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:2:3">11:1:2:3</span></span>3. And,
indeed, this sacrifice is the blowing (wind): he blows here, as it were,
as a single one, but when he has entered into man, he is divided into
ten parts;--with the vital airs thus distributed, it (the sacrifice) is
born from out of its womb, the fire: this is that Virâ*g* of ten
syllables, this is that perfection, the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:2:4">11:1:2:4</span></span>4.
There may, however, be nine (oblations) <span
id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_76.md);--he thus forms a defective (lesser,
lower) Virâ*g* with a view to production; for from the lesser <span
id="fr_77"></span>[3](#fn_77.md), indeed, creatures are produced here: this
is that perfection, the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:2:5">11:1:2:5</span></span>5. But
there may be one additional (oblation) <span
id="fr_78"></span>[4](#fn_78.md),that one remains over for Pra*g*âpati:
this is that perfection, the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:2:6">11:1:2:6</span></span>6. And
there may be two additional (oblations) <span
id="fr_79"></span>[5](#fn_79.md),

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --a productive
pair consists of two: thus a productive pair is produced; this is that
perfection, the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:2:7">11:1:2:7</span></span>7. And
there may be three additional ones <span
id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md),--a productive pair consists of two, and
that which is produced is the third: this is that perfection, the
sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:2:8">11:1:2:8</span></span>8. And
there may be four additional ones <span
id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_81.md),--as the one so the four. There are these
three worlds; these worlds he thus gains by three (oblations); and
Pra*g*âpati, indeed, is the fourth beyond these worlds: by the fourth
(oblation) he thus gains Pra*g*âpati,--this is that perfection, the
sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:2:9">11:1:2:9</span></span>9. That
(sacrifice) which is defective in two (oblations) <span
id="fr_82"></span>[3](#fn_82.md) is indeed defective, it is not a
sacrifice; and that which is excessive in respect of five (oblations) is
indeed excessive, it is not a sacrifice: this is that perfection as
regards the ten, the twenty, thus up to a thousand <span
id="fr_83"></span>[4](#fn_83.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:2:10">11:1:2:10</span></span>10.
Verily, they who perform the Full and New-moon sacrifice, run a
race <span id="fr_84"></span>[5](#fn_84.md). One ought to perform it during
fifteen years;--in these fifteen years there are three hundred and sixty
full moons and new

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

moons; and there are in a year three hundred and sixty nights: it is the
nights he thus gains.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:2:11">11:1:2:11</span></span>11.
He should then offer for another fifteen years; in these fifteen years
there are three hundred and sixty full moons and new moons; and there
are in a year three hundred and sixty days it is the days he thus gains,
and the year itself he thus gains.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:2:12">11:1:2:12</span></span>12.
Now, indeed, the gods were at first mortal; and only when they had
gained the year they were immortal; for the year is everything, and the
imperishable means everything: thereby then accrues to him imperishable
merit, the imperishable world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:2:13">11:1:2:13</span></span>13.
He who, knowing this, offers (the Full and New-moon sacrifice) for
thirty years, becomes one of the race-runners, whence one ought to offer
sacrifice for not less than thirty years. But if he be a performer of
the Dâkshâya*n*a sacrifice <span id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85.md), he need
only offer for fifteen years, for therein that perfection is brought
about, since he performs (every month) two Full-moon and two New-moon
offerings, and thus that perfection is indeed brought about therein.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_75"></span>[3:1](sbe44004.htm#fr_75.md) These ten oblations of
the New and Full-moon sacrifice (as the model for Havirya*gñ*as
generally), as enumerated by Sâya*n*a, are (*a*) at full moon--five
fore-offerings, two butter-portions, two cake-offerings to Agni, and
Agni-Soma, and a low-voiced offering to Agni-Soma, (*b*) at new
moon--five fore-offerings, two butter-portions, a cake to Agni, a
low-voiced offering to Vish*n*u, and an offering of (sweet and sour)
milk, or Sânnâyya, to Indra.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[3:2](sbe44004.htm#fr_76.md) Viz. inasmuch as,
according to Sâya*n*a, at the Full-moon sacrifice the offering to
Agni-Soma only takes place in the case of one who is a Soma-offerer. I
find, however, no authority for this.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[3:3](sbe44004.htm#fr_77.md) Or, from the lower
part (nyûna); cf. II, 1, 1, 13; 5, I, 20.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[3:4](sbe44004.htm#fr_78.md) That is, if the
oblation to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t (part i, p. 199 seqq.) is taken into
account.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[3:5](sbe44004.htm#fr_79.md) According to Sâya*n*a,
the second additional offering is the oblation of clotted ghee to
Vanaspati (the lord of the forest, or <span id="page_4">p. 4</span> the
tree, i.e. the sacrificial stake, or Soma) at the animal sacrifice. Cf.
part ii, p. 208.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[4:1](sbe44004.htm#fr_80.md) These three oblations,
according to Sâya*n*a, are the three after-offerings (to the Barhis, to
Nârâ*s*a*m*sa, and to Agni), see part i, p. 230 seqq.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[4:2](sbe44004.htm#fr_81.md) Viz. either the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t and the three after-offerings; or the four
Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as (to Soma, Tvash*tri*, the wives of the gods, and Agni
G*ri*hapati), cf. part i, p. 256 seqq.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[4:3](sbe44004.htm#fr_82.md) That is, if it
includes only eight oblations, see [paragraph 4](sbe44004.htm#11:1:2:4.md).

<span id="fn_83"></span>[4:4](sbe44004.htm#fr_83.md) That is, counting
every ten (oblations) one Virâ*g*, or metrical pâda of ten syllables.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[4:5](sbe44004.htm#fr_84.md) Viz. running along, as
they do, with the revolutions of the moon and the sun.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[5:1](sbe44004.htm#fr_85.md) For this modification
of the New and Full-moon sacrifice, see part i, p. 374 seqq.
