### EIGHTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:1">12:8:1:1</span></span>1. Now,
when Indra's energies, or vital powers, departed from him, the gods
restored them by means of this very sacrifice. Both cups of milk and
cups of Surâ-liquor are filled: they thereby restore to him his
energies, or vital powers. On the northern fire they offer (from) the
cups of milk, and thereby provide him <span
id="fr_593"></span>[1](#fn_591.md) with the bright liquor, with the
Soma-drink.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:2">12:8:1:2</span></span>2. He
(the Adhvaryu) offers (of the three cups of milk) with (Vâ*g*. S. XIX,
32), 'By their devotions the buffalos quicken the sacrifice,'--the
buffalos, doubtless, are the officiating priests, and devotion is
sacrifice: through the priests he causes the sacrifice to prosper, and
through the sacrifice the sacrificer <span
id="fr_594"></span>[2](#fn_592.md);--'the barhis-seated one, supplied with
Surâ and goodly heroes,' supplied with Surâ, indeed, is this
barhis-seated sacrifice, to wit, the Sautrâma*n*î: by means of the
barhis (the sacred grass on the Vedi), and the sacrifice, he causes him
to prosper;--'they who bestow Soma,'--they thus bestow the Soma-drink
upon him;--'with the deities in heaven,'--they thus place him with the
deities in heaven;--'may we enjoy ourselves,'--the Soma-juice, indeed,
conduces

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

to joy, and so does the Surâ-liquor: both the joy of Soma and the joy of
Surâ he thus secures;--'worshipping Indra with good hymns of
praise!'--for the hymn of praise is food for the gods, and the sacrifice
also is food: by sacrifice, by food, he thus makes him successful.
Having sacrificed, they drink (of the milk), and thereby increase what
is prosperous with him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:3">12:8:1:3</span></span>3. He
drinks <span id="fr_595"></span>[1](#fn_593) with (Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 34.md),
'The (Soma) which the A*s*vins (brought away) from Namu*k*i, the
Asura,'--for the two A*s*vins indeed brought away that (Soma juice) from
Namu*k*i;--'and Sarasvatî distilled for the sake of Indra's
strength,'--for Sarasvatî indeed distilled it for the sake of Indra's
strength;--'that clear, sweet draught,'--for clear and sweet indeed is
that draught, Soma;--'King Soma I now drink,'--it is thus king Soma that
comes to be drunk by him. The cups of Surâ-liquor they offer (from) on
the southern fire <span id="fr_596"></span>[2](#fn_594.md), and thereby
keep him (the Sacrificer) from evil <span
id="fr_597"></span>[3](#fn_595.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:4">12:8:1:4</span></span>4. He
(the Pratiprasthât*ri*) offers (libations from the cups of
Surâ-liquor <span id="fr_598"></span>[4](#fn_596).md), with (Vâ*g*. S. XIX,
33), 'What essence there is of thine, gathered from the plants,' for
this Surâ-liquor, indeed, is the essence

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

of both the waters and the plants: by the essence of both the waters and
the plants he thus causes him to prosper;--'the strength of the
Soma-juice together with the Surâ-liquor,'--he thereby secures what
strength there is in the Soma-juice and in the Surâ-liquor;--'by that
exhilarating drink quicken thou the Sacrificer,'--that is, 'by that
exhilarating drink gladden thou the Sacrificer;'--'Sarasvatî, the
A*s*vins, Indra, and Agni,'--by deities he (the priest) thus causes the
sacrifice to prosper, and by deities and sacrifice the Sacrificer.
Having made the offering, they drink (the liquor), and thereby cause to
prosper what is unprosperous with him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:5">12:8:1:5</span></span>5. He
drinks, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 35), 'Whatever is mingled herewith of the
juicy Soma,'--he thereby secures for him the essence (juice) of the
effused (extracted) and the infused <span
id="fr_599"></span>[1](#fn_597) (Soma.md);--'which Indra drank with
eagerness,'--for Indra, indeed, drank it with eagerness;--'that
(essence) thereof (I drink) with propitious mind,'--for unpropitious, as
it were, to a Brâhma*n*a is that drink, the Surâ-liquor: having thus
made it propitious, he takes it to himself;--'King Soma I drink,'--it is
thus king Soma that comes to be drunk by him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:6">12:8:1:6</span></span>6.
Here, now, other Adhvaryus hire some Râ*g*anya or Vai*s*ya with the view
that he shall drink that (liquor); but let him not do this; for, indeed,
this Soma-drink falls to the share of the fathers and grandfathers of
whoever drinks (the liquor <span id="fr_600"></span>[2](#fn_598).md) on

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

this occasion. Having shifted three coals of the southern fire to
outside the enclosing-stones <span id="fr_601"></span>[1](#fn_599.md), he
may there offer (of the liquor) with these (three) utterances (Vâ*g*. S.
XIX, 36):--

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:7">12:8:1:7</span></span>7. 'To
the Svadhâ-loving Fathers be Svadhâ, adoration!' he thereby places the
Fathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the Fathers.--'To the
Svadhâ-loving grandfathers he Svadhâ, adoration!' he thereby places the
grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the grandfathers.--'To the
Svadhâ-loving great-grandfathers be Svadhâ, adoration!' he thereby
places the great-grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the
great-grandfathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:8">12:8:1:8</span></span>8.
Having fetched water, he pours it (into the cups) with, 'The Fathers
have drunk:' he thereby bestows food on them;--'the Fathers have enjoyed
themselves:' he thereby causes them to enjoy themselves;--'the Fathers
have become satisfied:' he thereby satisfies them;--'may the Fathers
cleanse themselves!' he thereby purifies all of them from the first
downwards, for the Sautrâma*n*î is a means of purification <span
id="fr_602"></span>[2](#fn_600.md).

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:9">12:8:1:9</span></span>9. By
three implements of purification he purifies,--three in number are these
worlds: by means of these worlds he thus purifies him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:10">12:8:1:10</span></span>10.
With 'pâvamânî <span id="fr_603"></span>[1](#fn_601) (verses.md)' they
purify; for pâvamânîs are a means of purification: by a means of
purification they thus purify him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:11">12:8:1:11</span></span>11.
With three (verses) they purify each time,--there are three vital airs,
the in-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: it is by
means of these that they purify him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:12">12:8:1:12</span></span>12.
With nine (verses) they purify,--there are nine vital airs: by means of
the vital airs they purify him, and when purified they establish him
again in the vital airs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:13">12:8:1:13</span></span>13.
They purify by means of a (goat's hair and sheep's wool) strainer,--such
a strainer doubtless is a form (symbol) of goats and sheep: by means of
goats and sheep they thus purify him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:14">12:8:1:14</span></span>14.
They purify by means of a tail-whisk,--such a tail-whisk doubtless is a
form of kine and horses: with kine and horses they thus purify him.

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:15">12:8:1:15</span></span>15.
They purify by means of gold,--that (metal), to wit, gold, doubtless is
a form of the gods: by means of a form of the gods they thus purify him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:16">12:8:1:16</span></span>16.
They purify him by means of Surâ-liquor, for the Surâ is purified: they
thus purify him by that which is purified; and even as the liquor,
whilst being purified, is cleared of impure matter <span
id="fr_604"></span>[1](#fn_602.md), so is that Sacrificer thereby freed
from all evil who, knowing this, performs the Sautrâma*n*î, or who even
knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:17">12:8:1:17</span></span>17.
Here, now, they ask, 'Is the Sautrâma*n*î to be performed, or is it not
to be performed, seeing that (in any case) they continuously repel from
him all evil?' As to this Revottaras Sthapati Pâ*t*ava Kâkra once said,
'Even after making the surrender, one ought certainly to perform the
sacrifice; for the Sacrificer is the body of the sacrifice, and the
officiating priests are its limbs; and wherever the body is pure there
the limbs also are pure; both of them, indeed, purify him, and both of
them repel the evil from him: therefore even after making the surrender
(of one's own self) one ought certainly to sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:18">12:8:1:18</span></span>18.
But, indeed, those who perform at the southern fire, go down to the
world of the Fathers. He offers an oblation of ghee: ghee being
(material of) sacrifice, it is by sacrifice that they establish
themselves in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:19">12:8:1:19</span></span>19.
He (the Sacrificer) offers, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 45), 'The Fathers who,
one in form and one in mind, live in Yama's realm,--may their world,

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

the Svadhâ, adoration, and sacrifice prosper among the gods!' he thereby
commits the Fathers to Yama, and he also conquers the world of the
Fathers. Having, all of them, invested themselves sacrificially <span
id="fr_605"></span>[1](#fn_603.md), they betake themselves to the northern
fire, for the northern fire <span id="fr_606"></span>[2](#fn_604.md) is
this (terrestrial) world <span id="fr_607"></span>[3](#fn_605.md): they
thus establish themselves in this world. He offers an oblation of ghee:
ghee being sacrifice, it is from out of the sacrifice that they
establish themselves in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:20">12:8:1:20</span></span>20.
He (the Sacrificer) offers, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 46), 'Mine own (people)
who are one in form and one in mind, living among the living,--may their
fortune prosper with me, in this world, for a hundred years!' he thereby
secures the good fortune of his own people, and he also confers long
life on them. Whilst they hold on to each other, he (the Adhvaryu)
offers milk, for milk is vital air and food: in the vital air, in food,
they thus finally establish themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:21">12:8:1:21</span></span>21.
He offers, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 47), 'Two paths for mortals have I heard
of, (that of the Fathers and that of the gods <span
id="fr_608"></span>[4](#fn_606).md),'--'two paths

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

indeed there are,' they say, 'those of the gods and of the
Fathers,'--'thereon all that liveth here passeth,' for thereon, indeed,
everything living here passes;--'what there is between the father and
the mother,'--the father, doubtless, is yonder (sky), and the mother is
this (earth): by means of these two he leads the Fathers to the world of
heaven. He (the Sacrificer) alone drinks what is left from the
offering <span id="fr_609"></span>[1](#fn_607.md): to himself alone he thus
takes prosperity, for milk is prosperity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:1:22">12:8:1:22</span></span>22.
He drinks it, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 48), 'May this oblation be productive
for me,'--for productive indeed it is, whether it be milk or
Soma;--'possessed of ten heroes,'--the ten heroes, doubtless, are the
vital airs: vital airs he thus takes to himself;--'possessed of all the
troops,'--all the troops, doubtless, are the limbs: it is limbs he thus
takes to himself;--'for well-being: breath-winning,'--the breath of life
he thus wins;--'race-winning,'--a race (offspring) he thus
wins;--'cattle-winning,'--cattle he thus wins;--'place-winning'--for it
is for a place (in heaven) that he sacrifices: it is that he
gains;--'safety-winning,'--the (place of) safety, doubtless, is the
heavenly world: in the heavenly world he thus finally establishes
himself;--'May Agni raise for me abundant offspring,

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

and bestow ye upon us food, milk, and seed!' it is to those (priests)
who offer for him that he thus says, 'Bestow ye all this upon me!' By
means of gold they cleanse themselves <span
id="fr_610"></span>[1](#fn_608.md); for gold is immortal life: in immortal
life they thus finally establish themselves.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_591"></span>[231:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_593.md) Or, cause him to
prosper, render him successful by means of the liquor; MS. I. O. 311
reads 'samardhayanti.'

<span id="fn_592"></span>[231:2](sbe44068.htm#fr_594.md) Or, perhaps, he
provides the sacrifice with priests, and the Sacrificer with sacrifice.
For obvious reasons the first two pâdas of the verse have been
transposed in the translation.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[232:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_595.md) For particulars as
to the persons who partake of the respective cups of milk and
Surâ-liquor, see [XII, 8, 2, 22](sbe44069.htm#12:8:2:22.md) seqq.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[232:2](sbe44068.htm#fr_596.md) That is, on the
fire of the southern of the two special Vedis, see [p.
225](sbe44067.htm#page_225.md), note.

<span id="fn_595"></span>[232:3](sbe44068.htm#fr_597.md) Viz. inasmuch as
the libations of liquor are not made on the offering-fire proper, the
(northern) Âhavanîya, where the oblations from the cups of milk are
made.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[232:4](sbe44068.htm#fr_598.md) These cups are of
the same kind as those used for the draughts of Soma, being made of
palâ*s*a-wood, and resembling mortars in shape; cf. part ii, p. 259,
note 1, towards the end.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[233:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_599.md) For the
distinction between 'suta' and 'âsuta' (not 'asuta'), cf. [XII, 8, 2,
12](sbe44069.htm#12:8:2:12.md).

<span id="fn_598"></span>[233:2](sbe44068.htm#fr_600.md) According to Kâty.
*S*r. XIX, 3, 15, some authorities, however, <span id="page_234">p.
234</span> think the inhaling of the fumes of the liquor to be
sufficient for this purpose.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[234:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_601.md) The coals are to
be placed on the south side of the southern fire, from north to south,
and the libation from the Â*s*vina cup is made on the northernmost coal,
that from the Sârasvata cup on the central one, and that from the Aindra
cup on the southern one. According to Kâty. XIX, 3, 17, and Mahîdhara on
Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 36, this is a fourth alternative of disposing of the
liquor (in favour of the Fathers), the others being actual drinking, or
smelling it, or hiring some one to drink it.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[234:2](sbe44068.htm#fr_602.md) At [XII, 7, 2,
13](sbe44066.htm#12:7:2:13) a perforated pot (with a hundred holes.md) was
mentioned as being used at this sacrifice. According to Kâty. *S*r.
<span id="page_235">p. 235</span> XIX, 3, 20, and Mahîdhara on Vâ*g*. S.
XIX, 37, use is made of this pot at this juncture in much the same way
as is described in V, 5, 4, 27 seqq.; viz. two poles are driven into the
ground north and south of the southern fire, and a bamboo stick laid
thereon: on a string fastened to this stick the pot, containing a
tail-whisk (for straining) and a piece of gold, is then made to hang
over the fire, and the remains of the Surâ-liquor poured into it; and
whilst it trickles through into the fire, the priest makes the
Sacrificer pronounce the verses Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 37-44, 52-60, addressed
to the different kinds of departed ancestors.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[235:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_603.md) That is, verses
recited at the Soma-sacrifice whilst the Soma-juice is clarifying; the
term being usually confined to the verses of hymns of the ninth
ma*nd*ala of the *Ri*ksa*m*hitâ, whence indeed most of the verses used
on this occasion (Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 37-44) are taken.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[236:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_604.md) The term 'balkasa'
(apparently connected with 'valkala') would seem to mean vegetable
matter, esp. chaff or husks. The comm. explains it by 'kidisa' (?
kilbisha or kiknasa).

<span id="fn_603"></span>[237:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_605.md) That is, by
shifting their Brâhma*n*ical cord so as to hang across the breast from
the left shoulder to the right hip.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[237:2](sbe44068.htm#fr_606.md) That is, the fire
on the uttara-vedi of the northern of the two special Vedis, see [p.
225](sbe44067.htm#page_225.md), note.

<span id="fn_605"></span>[237:3](sbe44068.htm#fr_607.md) They are supposed
to return to the earth from the world of the Fathers below.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[237:4](sbe44068.htm#fr_608.md) Not only is the
second pâda of the verse omitted here (as also in MS. I. O. 311), but
the construction of the first half of the verse is also rather peculiar,
the most natural rendering being, 'Two paths of the Fathers have I heard
of, (those) of the gods and of men.' The same verse occurs *Ri*ks. X,
88, 15 (with the reading 'dve srutî' instead of 'dve s*ri*tî'), where
Grassmann translates,--<span id="page_238">p. 238</span> 'Two paths
there are, so the Fathers have told me, passable for gods and men;'
whilst Ludwig takes it in the way just referred to. The above
interpretation is that of Mahîdhara, who refers to *S*at.-Br. I, 9, 2,
3; whilst Sâya*n*a (on Riks.) seems to take the two paths to be that of
the Fathers and gods, and that of men (pit*rîn*â*m* devânâ*m* *k*otâpi
martyânâ*m* *k*a dve srutî dvau mârgau); though he afterwards calls them
'devayâna' and 'pit*ri*yâ*n*a.'

<span id="fn_607"></span>[238:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_609.md) That is to say,
the milk which remains in the pot (ukhâ), from which the milk used for
the oblation was taken.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[239:1](sbe44068.htm#fr_610.md) Kâty. *S*r. XIX,
3, 27, 'Over the *k*âtvâla (pit) they cleanse themselves, with their
wives, putting gold between;' that is to say, whilst the water is poured
on their hands a piece of gold is held between, over which the water
flows.
