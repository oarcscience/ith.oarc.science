### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:3:1">11:3:3:1</span></span>1. The
Brahman delivered the creatures over to Death, the Brahma*k*ârin
(religious student) alone it did not deliver over to him. He (Death)
said, 'Let me have a share in this one also.'--'Only the night on which
he shall not bring his <span id="fr_184"></span>[2](#fn_184.md) fire-wood,'
said (the Brahman). On whatever night, therefore, the Brahma*k*ârin does
not bring fire-wood, that

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (night) he
passes <span id="fr_185"></span>[1](#fn_185.md) cutting it off from his own
life: therefore the Brahma*k*ârin should bring fire-wood, lest he should
pass (his nights) cutting off (as much) from his life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:3:2">11:3:3:2</span></span>2. He
who enters on a Brahma*k*ârin's life, indeed, enters on a long
sacrificial session: the log he puts on the fire in entering thereon is
the opening (offering), and that which (he puts on the fire) when he is
about to bathe <span id="fr_186"></span>[2](#fn_186.md) is the concluding
(offering); and what (logs) there are between these, are just his (logs)
of the sacrificial session. When a Brâhma*n*a enters on a
Brahma*k*ârin's life--

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:3:3">11:3:3:3</span></span>3. He
enters beings in four parts: with one fourth part (he enters) the fire,
with another part death, with another part his religious teacher; and
his fourth part remains in his own self.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:3:4">11:3:3:4</span></span>4. Now,
when he brings a log for the fire, he redeems that fourth part of his
which is in the fire; and having cleansed <span
id="fr_187"></span>[3](#fn_187.md) it, he takes it to his own self, and it
enters him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:3:5">11:3:3:5</span></span>5. And
when, having made himself poor, as it were, and become devoid of shame,
he begs alms, then he redeems that part of his which is in death;

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

and, having cleansed it, he takes it to himself, and it enters him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:3:6">11:3:3:6</span></span>6. And
when he does the teacher's bidding, and when he does any work for the
teacher, he redeems that part of his which is in the teacher; and,
having cleansed it, he takes it to himself, and it enters him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:3:7">11:3:3:7</span></span>7. Let
him not beg alms after he has bathed (at the end of his studentship),
for by bathing he drives off beggary, and drives off hunger from his
kinsmen and his deceased ancestors, 'Let him who knows this beg alms
only from her in whom he has the greatest confidence <span
id="fr_188"></span>[1](#fn_188.md),' they say, 'for that makes for heaven.'
And should he find no other woman from whom alms could be begged, he may
even beg from his own teacher's wife, and thereafter from his own
mother <span id="fr_189"></span>[2](#fn_189). The seventh (night.md) should
not pass by for him without begging: him who knows this and practises
this all the Vedas enter; for, verily, even as the fire shines when
kindled, so does he, after bathing, shine, who, knowing this, lives a
Brahma*k*ârin's life.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_184"></span>[48:2](sbe44020.htm#fr_184.md) Prof. Delbrück,
Altind. Syntax, p. 260, doubtless rightly takes the middle form
(âharâtai) here to imply 'for his own self,' i.e. for his own protection
from death.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[49:1](sbe44020.htm#fr_185.md) Or, perhaps
better,--that (night) he keeps cutting off from his life,--in which case
the verb 'vas' would be construed with the gerund in much the same way
as 'sthâ' commonly is. This construction would suit even better the
second passage (without the object 'tâm') at the end of the paragraph.
In any case we have to understand that, during every night passed with
his teacher without his having brought fire-wood, he cuts off a night,
or day, from (the latter end of) his life. Cf. Delbrück, Altind. Syntax,
pp. 260, 334, 405.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[49:2](sbe44020.htm#fr_186.md) That is, prior to
his leaving the house of his teacher and returning to his own family.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[49:3](sbe44020.htm#fr_187.md) Sa*m*sk*ri*tya =
utk*ri*sh*t*a*m* k*ri*tvâ, Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[50:1](sbe44020.htm#fr_188.md) That is, from whom
he is perfectly sure of getting something. Sâya*n*a, however, takes it
in the sense of 'from whom he feels sure he will get most,'--Sa
brahma*k*ârî yasyâ eva bhikshitâyâ*h* striya*h* sakâ*s*âd bhûyish*th*am
bahutaram annam labhyata iti *s*lâgheta tâ*m* bhikshetety âhu*h*, Sây.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[50:2](sbe44020.htm#fr_189.md) That is, after
leaving his teacher's house and returning home.
