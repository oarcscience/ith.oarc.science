Now, the A<I>m</I><I>s</I>u (cup of Soma)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_337"></A><A HREF="#fn_337"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, indeed, is no other than Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati; and it is the body of this (sacrifice), for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, indeed, is the body. And the Ad&acirc;bhya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_338"></A><A HREF="#fn_338"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (cup of Soma) is no other than speech. When he draws the A<I>m</I><I>s</I>u-cup, and then the Ad&acirc;bhya-cup, he thereby constructs the body of this (sacrifice) and then establishes that speech therein.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:9:2">11:5:9:2</A></FONT></span>2. And, indeed, the A<I>m</I><I>s</I>u is also the mind, and the Ad&acirc;bhya speech; and the A<I>m</I><I>s</I>u is the out-breathing, and the Ad&acirc;bhya the up-breathing; and the A<I>m</I><I>s</I>u is the eye, and the Ad&acirc;bhya the ear: these two cups they draw for the sake of wholeness and completeness.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:9:3">11:5:9:3</A></FONT></span>3. Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, were contending,--it was for this very sacrifice, for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, that they were contending, saying, 'Ours he shall be! ours he shall be!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:9:4">11:5:9:4</A></FONT></span>4. The gods then went on singing praises, and toiling. They saw this cup of Soma, this Ad&acirc;bhya, and drew it: they seized upon the (three) Soma-services, and possessed themselves of the whole sacrifice, and excluded the Asuras from the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:9:5">11:5:9:5</A></FONT></span>5. They spake, 'Surely, we have destroyed (adabh&acirc;ma) them;' whence (the cup is called) Ad&acirc;bhya;--'they have not destroyed (dabh) us;' whence also (it is called) Ad&acirc;bhya. And the Ad&acirc;bhya</p>

<p><A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A></p>  
<p>being speech, this speech is indestructible, whence also it is (called) Ad&acirc;bhya; and, verily, in like manner does he who knows this possess himself of the whole sacrifice of his spiteful enemy, and exclude and shut out his spiteful enemy from all participation in the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:9:6">11:5:9:6</A></FONT></span>6. Into the same vessel with which he draws the A<I>m</I><I>s</I>u&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_339"></A><A HREF="#fn_339"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> he pours water from the Nigr&acirc;bhy&acirc;<I>h</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_340"></A><A HREF="#fn_340"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and therein puts those Soma-plants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_341"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 47),--</p>

'Thou art taken with a support&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_342"></A><A HREF="#fn_342"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>: for Agni I take thee, possessed of the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; metre!'--the morning-service is of G&acirc;yatr&icirc; nature: he thus possesses himself of the morning-service;--'For Indra I take thee, possessed of the Trish<I>t</I>ubh metre!'--the midday-service is of Trish<I>t</I>ubh nature: he thus possesses himself of the midday-service;--'For the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I> I take thee, possessed of the <I>G</I>agat&icirc; metre!'--the evening-service is of <I>G</I>agat&icirc; nature: he thus possesses himself of the evening-service;--'The Anush<I>t</I>ubh is thy song of praise;'--whatever is subsequent to the (three) services&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_343"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, that is of Anush<I>t</I>ubh nature: it is thereof he thus possesses</p>

<p>himself. He does not press this (batch of Soma-plants) lest he should injure speech (or, the voice of the sacrifice), for the press-stone is a thunderbolt, and the Ad&acirc;bhya is speech.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:9:8">11:5:9:8</A></FONT></span>8. He merely shakes the (cup with the) plants with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 48), 'In the flow of the streaming (waters) I waft thee! in the flow of the gurgling I waft thee! in the flow of the jubilant I waft thee! in the flow of the most delightsome I waft thee! in the flow of the most sweet I waft thee!' These doubtless are the divine waters: he thus bestows sap on him (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, the sacrifice) by means of both the divine and the human waters which there are.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:9:9">11:5:9:9</A></FONT></span>9. 'Thee, the bright, I waft in the bright,'--for he indeed wafts the bright one in the bright;--'in the form of the day, in the rays of the sun;'--he thus wafts it both in the form of the day and in the rays of the sun.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:9:10">11:5:9:10</A></FONT></span>10. [V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 41], 'Mightily shineth the towering form of the ball,'--for mightily indeed shines that towering form of the ball, to wit, yonder burning (sun);--'the bright one, the leader of the bright one, Soma, the leader of Soma,'--he thereby makes that bright (sun) the leader of the bright (Soma), and Soma the leader of the Soma;--'what indestructible, watchful name there is of thine, for that do I take thee;'--for this, to wit, speech, is indeed his (Soma's) indestructible (ad&acirc;bhya), watchful name: it is thus speech he thereby takes for speech.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:9:11">11:5:9:11</A></FONT></span>11. Then, stepping out (from the Havirdh&acirc;na shed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_344"></A><A HREF="#fn_344"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>) to (the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya), he offers with, 'O</p>

<p><A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Soma, to this thy Soma, hail!'--he thus offers Soma to Soma, and so does not throw speech into the fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_345"></A><A HREF="#fn_345"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. He breathes over gold&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_346"></A><A HREF="#fn_346"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: the meaning of this is the same as there (on the occasion of the A<I>m</I><I>s</I>u). He gives as many presents (to the priests) as for the A<I>m</I><I>s</I>u-graha.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:9:12">11:5:9:12</A></FONT></span>12. He then puts the Soma-plants back (on the heap of plants in the Havirdh&acirc;na) with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 50), 'Enter thou gladly Agni's dear seat, O divine Soma!--Enter thou willingly Indra's dear seat, O divine Soma!--As our friend enter thou, O divine Soma, the dear seat of the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>!' On that former occasion he possessed himself of the (three) Soma services; he now restores them again, and causes them to be no longer used up; and with them thus restored they perform the sacrifice.</p>
