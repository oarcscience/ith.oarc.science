### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:3:1">13:2:3:1</span></span>1. Now,
the gods did not know the Pavamâna <span id="fr_775"></span>[2](#fn_771.md)
at the A*s*vamedha to be the heavenly world, but the horse knew it.
When, at the A*s*vamedha,

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

they glide along <span id="fr_776"></span>[1](#fn_772.md) with the horse
for the Pavamâna (-stotra), it is for getting to know (the way to) the
heavenly world; and they hold on to the horse's tail, in order to reach
the heavenly world; for man does not rightly know (the way to) the
heavenly world, but the horse does rightly know it

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:3:2">13:2:3:2</span></span>2. Were
the Udgât*ri* to chant the Udgîtha <span
id="fr_777"></span>[2](#fn_773.md), it would be even as if one who does not
know the country were to lead by another (than the right) way. But if,
setting aside the Udgât*ri*, he chooses

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

the horse for (performing) the Udgîtha, it is just as when one who knows
the country leads on the right way: the horse leads the Sacrificer
rightly to the heavenly world. It makes 'Hiṅ <span
id="fr_778"></span>[1](#fn_774.md),' and thereby makes the. Sâman itself to
be 'hiṅ': this is the Udgîtha. They pen up mares, (and on seeing the
horse) they utter a shrill sound: as when the chanters sing, such like
is this. The priests’ fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the
mystic import of this has been explained <span
id="fr_779"></span>[2](#fn_775.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_771"></span>[304:2](sbe44085.htm#fr_775.md) Pavamâna is the
name of the pressed Soma while it is 'clarifying.' Hence the first
stotra of each of the three Savanas of a Soma-day--chanted after the
pressing of the Soma and the drawing of the principal cups--is called
Pavamâna-stotra. Whether by the term 'Pavamâna' here the clarifying Soma
is alluded to, as well as the stotra--which alone the commentator takes
it to mean, and to which the second mention certainly refers--must
remain <span id="page_305">p. 305</span> doubtful. The commentator, it
would seem, accounts for this identification of the Pavamâna-stotra with
heaven by the fact that the second day of the A*s*vamedha is an
ekavi*ms*a day (see [XIII, 3, 3, 3](sbe44096.htm#13:3:3:3.md); Tâ*nd*ya-Br.
XXI, 4, 1), i.e. one on which all the stotras are performed in the
twenty-one-versed hymn-form; and that the Sun is commonly called
'ekavi*ms*a,' the twenty-first, or twenty-one-fold. The particular chant
intended is that of the morning pressing, viz. the Bahishpavamâna, or
outside-Pavamâna-stotra, so-called because at the ordinary one-day's
Soma-sacrifice, it is chanted outside the Sadas. But, on the other hand,
in the case of Ahîna-sacrifices, or those lasting from two to twelve
days, that stotra is chanted outside only on the first day, whilst on
the others it is done inside the Sadas. An exception is, however, made
in the case of the A*s*vamedha, which requires the morning Pavamâna, on
all three days, to be performed in its usual place on the north-eastern
part of Vedi, south of the *K*âtvâla.

<span id="fn_772"></span>[305:1](sbe44085.htm#fr_776.md) For the noiseless
way of sliding or creeping from the Sadas, and returning thither, and
approaching the different Dhish*n*yas, or fire-hearths, see part ii, p.
299, note 2. As has already been stated, it is only after the chanting
of the Bahishpavamâna that the victims are driven up to the offering
place.

<span id="fn_773"></span>[305:2](sbe44085.htm#fr_777.md) It is from this,
the principal part of the Sâman, or chanted verse (cf. part ii, p. 310,
note), that the Udgât*ri* takes his name; this particular function of
his being, on the present occasion, supposed to he performed by the
whinnying of the horse. After this they make the horse step on the
chanting-ground, apparently either as a visible recognition of the part
it has been made to play, or because the horse thereby is made to go to
heaven with which the Bahishpavamâna was identified.

<span id="fn_774"></span>[306:1](sbe44085.htm#fr_778.md) On the mystic
significance of this ejaculation (here compared with the neighing of the
horse) in the sacrifice, and especially in the Sâman, see I, 4, 1, 1
seqq.; II, 2, 4, 12.

<span id="fn_775"></span>[306:2](sbe44085.htm#fr_779.md) [XII, 7, 2,
13](sbe44066.htm#12:7:2:13.md).
