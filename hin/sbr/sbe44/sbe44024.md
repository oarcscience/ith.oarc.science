### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:4:1">11:4:4:1</span></span>1. Now,
as to the successful issue of the sacrificial food. Now, indeed, there
are six doors to the Brahman <span id="fr_224"></span>[3](#fn_224)--to
wit, fire, wind, the waters, the moon, lightning, and the sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:4:2">11:4:4:2</span></span>2. He
who offers with slightly burnt sacrificial food, enters through the
fire-door <span id="fr_225"></span>[4](#fn_225) of the Brahman;

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

and, by entering through the fire-door of the Brahman, he wins his union
with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:4:3">11:4:4:3</span></span>3. And
he who offers with sacrificial food that has fallen (on the ground)
enters through the wind-door of the Brahman; and, by entering through
the wind-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation
in the world of, the Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:4:4">11:4:4:4</span></span>4. And
he who offers with uncooked sacrificial food, enters through the
water-door of the Brahman; and, by entering through the water-door of
the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of,
the Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:4:5">11:4:4:5</span></span>5. And
he who offers with slightly browned sacrificial food, enters through the
moon-door of the Brahman, and, by entering through the moon-door of the
Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the
Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:4:6">11:4:4:6</span></span>6. And
he who offers with browned sacrificial food, enters through the
lightning-door of the Brahman, and, by entering through the
lightning-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation
in the world of, the Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:4:7">11:4:4:7</span></span>7. And
he who offers with well-cooked sacrificial food, enters through the
sun-door of the Brahman; and, by entering through the sun-door of the
Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the
Brahman. This, then, is the successful issue of the sacrificial food,
and, verily, whosoever thus knows this to be the successful issue of the
sacrificial food, by him offering is made with wholly successful
sacrificial food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:4:8">11:4:4:8</span></span>8.
Then, as to the successful issue of the sacrifice. Now, whatever part of
the sacrifice is incomplete

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (nyûna) that part
of it is productive for him <span id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_226); and
what is redundant in it that is favourable to cattle; and what is broken
(disconnected) <span id="fr_227"></span>[2](#fn_227) in it that makes
for prosperity; and what is perfect in it that is conducive to heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:4:9">11:4:4:9</span></span>9. And
if he think, 'There has been that which was incomplete in my sacrifice,'
let him believe, 'That is productive for me: I shall have offspring
produced (in men and cattle).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:4:10">11:4:4:10</span></span>10.
And if he think, 'There has been that which was redundant in my
sacrifice,' let him believe, 'That is favourable to cattle for me: I
shall become possessed of cattle.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:4:11">11:4:4:11</span></span>11.
And if he think, 'There has been that which was disconnected in my
sacrifice,' let him believe, 'That makes for my prosperity: Prosperity,
surrounded by splendour, fame and holy lustre, will accrue to me.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:4:4:12">11:4:4:12</span></span>12.
And if he think, 'There has been that which was perfect in my
sacrifice,' let him believe, 'That is conducive to heaven for me: I
shall become one of those in the heavenly world.' This then is the
successful issue of the sacrifice; and, verily, whosoever thus knows
this to be the successful issue of the sacrifice, by him offering is
made by a wholly successful sacrifice.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[66:3](sbe44024.htm#fr_224) That is, of the
(impersonal) world-spirit.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[66:4](sbe44024.htm#fr_225) In the text the two
words are not compounded, but stand in apposition to each other (with
the fire as the door of B.), with, however, much the same force as a
compound word. Cf. [XII, 2, 2, 2](sbe44050.htm#12:2:2:2) gâdham (eva)
pratish*th*â (a foothold consisting of a ford), and ib.
[9](sbe44050.htm#12:2:2:9) gâdha-pratish*th*a, 'ford-foothold.'

<span id="fn_226"></span>[68:1](sbe44024.htm#fr_226) See [XI, 1, 2,
4](sbe44004.htm#11:1:2:4);--tad asya ya*gñ*asya pra*g*ananam
pra*g*otpattisâdhanam.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[68:2](sbe44024.htm#fr_227) Sâya*n*a's
explanation of the term 'sa*m*kasuka' (? broken, affected with gaps) is
not available owing to an omission in the MS. Ind. Off. 1071.
