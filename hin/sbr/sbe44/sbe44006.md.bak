### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:4:1">11:1:4:1</span></span>1. Now,
some people enter upon the fast <span id="fr_90"></span>[3](#fn_90.md) when

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

they (still) see (the moon, on the fourteenth day of the half-month),
thinking, 'To-morrow he will not rise,'--either on account of clouds or
not having ascertained properly, they enter upon the fast, and (in the
morning) he rises over him. Now if he (the moon) should rise on (the
material for) the oblation being not yet taken out, then that approved
(procedure is followed) and the same fasting-observance. The sour curds
from last night's milking they use for coagulating the sacrificial
food <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91.md); they let the calves join
(their mothers), and drive them away again <span
id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_92.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:4:2">11:1:4:2</span></span>2. In
the afternoon he drives them away with the par*n*a-branch; and as there
that approved oblation of the New-moon offering (is prepared) so here.
But if he should not care to undergo (again) the fasting-observance, or
if (the moon) were to rise over (the material for) the oblation already
taken out, then let him do otherwise: having properly cleansed the
rice-grains of the husks, he cooks the smaller ones as a cake on eight
potsherds for Agni Dât*ri* (the Giver).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:4:3">11:1:4:3</span></span>3. And
the sour curds (from the milk) milked on the day before (he prepares)
for Indra Pradât*ri*

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the Bestower);
and those (larger) rice-grains <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md) he
cooks in boiled fresh milk as a pap for Vish*n*u *S*ipivish*t*a (the
Bald); for a pap it is whenever rice-grains are thrown (into milk or
sour curds).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:4:4">11:1:4:4</span></span>4. And
as to this being so, it is because that moon is no other than King Soma,
the food of the gods;--he (the Sacrificer) at that time sought to secure
him <span id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_94.md), and missed him: Agni, the
Giver, gives that (moon) to him, and Indra, the Bestower, bestows that
one upon him; Indra and Agni give that (moon, Soma) as a sacrifice to
him, and that sacrifice given by Indra and Agni he offers. And as to why
(he offers) to Vish*n*u, the Bald, it is because Vish*n*u is the
sacrifice; and as to why to the Bald <span id="fr_95"></span>[3](#fn_95.md)
(*s*ipivish*t*a),--it is that his missing him whom he sought to secure
is the bald part (? *s*ipita) of the sacrifice, hence to the Bald one.
And on this occasion he should give (to the priests) as much as he is
able to give, for no oblation, they say, should be without a dakshi*n*â.
And let him observe the fast just (on the day) when he (the moon) does
not rise.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_90"></span>[7:3](sbe44006.htm#fr_90.md) As, for the Full-moon
offering, the Sacrificer should enter on <span id="page_8">p. 8</span>
the fast at the very time of full moon (I, 6, 3, 34), so, for the
New-moon offering, he should do so at the time when the last sign of the
moon has disappeared, cf. I, 6, 4, 14.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[8:1](sbe44006.htm#fr_91.md) Literally, they make
it the means of coagulating the havis; that is to say, they put the
sour-milk (of last night's milking) into the milk obtained from the
milking of this, the second, day so as to produce the sour curds
required on the next, or offering-day. See I, 6, 4, 6 seq.;--pûrvedyu*h*
sâya*m*dugdha*m* payo yad dadhy âtmanâ vidyate parasmin divase puna*h*
kara*n*îyasya sâya*m*doharûpasya havisha âta*ñk*anârtha*m* kuryu*h*,
Sây.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[8:2](sbe44006.htm#fr_92.md) See I, 7, 1, 1 seq.
The milk of the evening milking will be required for the sour curds and
whey to be mixed with the sweet (boiled) milk of the following morning
in the preparation of the Sânnâyya.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[9:1](sbe44006.htm#fr_93.md) According to Katy.
*S*rautas. XXV, 4, 40, the rice-grains are sorted in three different
sizes; those of medium size being used for Agni Dât*ri*, the largest for
Indra Pradât*ri*, and the smallest for Vish*n*u *S*ipivish*t*a.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[9:2](sbe44006.htm#fr_94.md) That is, at the time
of new moon when Soma is supposed to stay on earth.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[9:3](sbe44006.htm#fr_95.md) The native
dictionaries also assign the meaning 'affected by a skin-disease' to
'*s*ipivish*t*a.'
