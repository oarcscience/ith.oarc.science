### SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:1:1">11:2:1:1</span></span>1.
Verily, man is born thrice, namely in this way:--first he is born from
his mother and father; and when he to whom the sacrifice inclines
performs offering he is born a second time; and when he dies, and they
place him on the fire, and when he

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

thereupon comes into existence again, he is born a third
time;--wherefore they say, 'Man is born thrice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:1:2">11:2:1:2</span></span>2. He
(the Hot*ri*) recites those eleven kindling-verses <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123),--there are these ten vital airs in man,
and the body in which these vital airs are established is the
eleventh,--so great, indeed, is man: he thus causes him to be born
complete. And what comes after the kindling-verses that is the
foundation: thus, having caused him to be born, he establishes him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:1:3">11:2:1:3</span></span>3.
There are nine utterances of impulsion (or quickening) <span
id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124),--there are these nine vital airs in
man: he thereby causes him to be born a second time; and the
(Adhvaryu's) call and (the Âgnîdhra's) response <span
id="fr_125"></span>[3](#fn_125) are the foundation. And when there, on
the occasion of the throwing <span id="fr_126"></span>[4](#fn_126) (of
the grass-bunch

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

into the fire), birth is spoken of, he thereby causes him to be born a
third time: on this occasion the Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as <span
id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_127) are the foundation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:1:4">11:2:1:4</span></span>4. For
thrice, indeed, man is born, and it is just in this way that he causes
him to be born thrice from the sacrifice. Of those eleven
(kindling-verses) he recites thrice the first and last:--

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:1:5">11:2:1:5</span></span>5. This
makes fifteen kindling-verses,--there are two libations of ghee
(âghâra <span id="fr_128"></span>[2](#fn_128)), five fore-offerings, the
I*d*â, three after-offerings, the Sûktavâka, and *S*amyorvâka <span
id="fr_129"></span>[3](#fn_129)--that makes thirteen oblations. And when
there, at the Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as, he takes up at the same time (the two
spoons); and the Samish*t*aya*g*us <span
id="fr_130"></span>[4](#fn_130):--

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:1:6">11:2:1:6</span></span>6. That
makes fifteen oblations:--for these fifteen oblations those fifteen
kindling-verses (serve, as it were, as) invitatory formulas; and for
these invitatory formulas these (serve as) offering-formulas--whatever
formula (is used) there (at those oblations) and what Nigada (is used at
the invocation of the I*d*â <span id="fr_131"></span>[5](#fn_131)) that
is of the form of offering-formulas. Thereby, then, those oblations of
his come to be supplied with invitatory formulas through those
kindling-verses; and through those oblations those invitatory formulas
come to be supplied with both offering-formulas and oblations.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_123"></span>[24:1](sbe44011.htm#fr_123) See part i, p. 95
seqq.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[24:2](sbe44011.htm#fr_124) According to
Sâya*n*a, this refers either to the formula by which the Adhvaryu calls
on the Hot*ri* to recite the kindling-verses, and which, he says,
consists of nine syllables (samidhyamânâyânubrûhi); or to nine
preliminary formulas (forming a nigada) pronounced by the Hot*ri* before
the performance of the fore-offerings, see I, 5, 2, 1 seqq. These latter
formulas are probably those intended by the author; the former formula
being the less likely to be referred to, as, in its above form of nine
syllables, it is indeed allowed to be used optionally by the
Âpastambasûtra, but not by the authorities of the white Ya*g*us, who use
the formula '(Hotar) Agnaye samidhyamânâyânubrûhi;' see *S*at. Br. I, 3,
5, 2. 3.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[24:3](sbe44011.htm#fr_125) Viz. the two
calls--'O*m* *s*râvaya' and 'Astu *s*rausha*t*,' see part i, p. 132,
note.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[24:4](sbe44011.htm#fr_126) The word
's*ri*sh*t*i' usually means 'creation,' but in accordance with the
primary meaning of the verb 's*rig*,' it apparently refers here (as
Sâya*n*a seems to think) to the throwing of the anointed Prastara, as
the representative of the Sacrificer, into the Âhavanîya fire, thus
insuring for the Sacrificer his despatch to, and renewed life in, the
heavenly world. With reference to <span id="page_25">p. 25</span> this
throwing of the grass-bunch into the fire (I, 8, 3, 11 seq.; 9, 2, 19)
some of the Sûtras use, indeed, the verb 's*rig*,' cf. Hillebrand, Das
Altindische Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p.146.
