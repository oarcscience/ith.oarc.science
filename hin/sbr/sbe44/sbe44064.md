#### EXPIATORY OBLATIONS OF SOMA-SACRIFICE.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:6:1:1">12:6:1:1</span></span>1.
Verily, Pra*g*âpati, the sacrifice, is King Soma; and these deities to
whom he offers, and these oblations which he offers, are forms of him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:6:1:2">12:6:1:2</span></span>2. If
any part of the sacrifice were to fail, let him make an oblation with
regard to that same deity for whom he may have intended (that part),--on
the Âhavanîya, if it is during the initiation and the

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Upasads; on the
Âgnîdhra, if it is at the Soma-pressing;--for whatever joint of the
sacrifice fails, that breaks; and whichever then is the deity in that
(part of the sacrifice) through that deity he heals the sacrifice,
through that one he makes the sacrifice complete again <span

thirty-three gods, and Pra*g*âpati is the thirty-fourth: with the help
of all the gods he thus heals the sacrifice, and with the help of all
the gods he makes it complete again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:6:1:38">12:6:1:38</span></span>38.
The Brahman (superintending priest) himself should perform them, and no
other than the Brahman; for the Brahman sits on the right (south)

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

side of the sacrifice, and protects the sacrifice on the right side. If,
however, the Brahman should not know (these formulas and oblations), any
one who knows them may perform them; but (let him do so) after applying
for leave to the Brahman, and with his permission. Now as to the meaning
of these (formulas). Vasish*th*a knew the Virâ*g* <span
id="fr_562"></span>[1](#fn_561): Indra coveted it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:6:1:39">12:6:1:39</span></span>39.
He spake, '*Ri*shi, thou knowest the Virâ*g*: teach me it!' He replied,
'What would therefrom accrue to me?'--'I would teach thee the expiation
for the whole sacrifice, I would show thee its form.'--He replied,
'Well, but tell me, if thou wert to teach me the expiation for the whole
sacrifice, what would become of him to whom thou wouldst show its
form?'--'Verily, he would depart from this world to the heaven of the
living.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:6:1:40">12:6:1:40</span></span>40.
The *Ri*shi then taught Indra that Virâ*g*;--but the Virâ*g*, they say,
is this (earth), whence he who possesses most thereof is the most
powerful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:6:1:41">12:6:1:41</span></span>41.
And Indra then taught the *Ri*shi this expiation from the Agnihotra up
to the Great Litany. And formerly, indeed, the Vasish*th*as alone knew
these utterances, whence formerly only one of the Vasish*th*a family
became Brahman; but since nowadays anybody (may) study them, anybody
(may) now become Brahman <span id="fr_563"></span>[2](#fn_562). And,
indeed, he who thus knows these utterances is worthy to become

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brahman, or may
reply, when addressed as 'Brahman <span
id="fr_564"></span>[1](#fn_563)!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_552"></span>[206:1](sbe44064.htm#fr_553) Cf. IV, 5, 7, 6.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[206:2](sbe44064.htm#fr_554) That is to say, if
untoward circumstances were to arise threatening to prevent the intended
Soma-sacrifice. The mental resolve (sa*m*kalpa), on the part of the
Sacrificer, is the first act in the performance of a sacrifice.

<span id="fn_554"></span>[206:3](sbe44064.htm#fr_555) Or, it (the
sacrifice), as Harisvâmin takes it.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[206:4](sbe44064.htm#fr_556) That is, after he
has announced his intention to perform a Soma-sacrifice, by saying
'Somena yakshye,' 'I will sacrifice by means of Soma.'

<span id="fn_556"></span>[207:1](sbe44064.htm#fr_557) See III, 6, 3, 4.
This particular ceremony is rather out of place here, as in its regular
order it should come after [paragraph 15](sbe44064.htm#12:6:1:15).

<span id="fn_557"></span>[209:1](sbe44064.htm#fr_558) See III, 9, 4, 19,
'Thrice he presses, and thrice he gathers (the beaten plants) together .
. .'

<span id="fn_558"></span>[210:1](sbe44064.htm#fr_559) Viz. to the
Havirdhâna where the cups from which libations have been made are
deposited on the mound (khara); cf. III, 1, 2, 24.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[211:1](sbe44064.htm#fr_560) See part ii, p.
154, note 1.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[211:2](sbe44064.htm#fr_561) The pressed-out
Soma-husks are taken down to (and thrown into) the water where the
Sacrificer is to bathe, see IV, 4, 5, 1 seqq.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[212:1](sbe44064.htm#fr_562) That is, the
'far-shining;' or 'far-ruling' (metre).

<span id="fn_562"></span>[212:2](sbe44064.htm#fr_563) Professor
Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 570, takes this clause thus:--'and
therefore even now he who remains of them (i.e. of the Vasish*th*a
family) is (? becomes) Brahman.' This rendering takes, however, no
account of the 'tu'; and, indeed, it will hardly fit in with the
relative clause which precedes it.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[213:1](sbe44064.htm#fr_564) That is to say,
when, as superintending priest, he is addressed by another priest asking
whether he may now begin some performance, or informing him that he is
about to do so, he may give the desired direction. Such applications by
the other priests begin with 'O Brahman!' cf. [XIII, 1, 2,
4](sbe44075.htm#13:1:2:4); and part i, p. 22, note 2.
