### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:3:1">12:2:3:1</span></span>1. That
year, doubtless, amounts to a B*ri*hatî--,there are two sha*d*ahas (12)
of winning days  <span id="fr_467"></span>[2](#fn_467.md); the

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

two, P*ri*sh*th*ya and Abhiplava (12); the Go and Âyus, and the
Da*s*arâtra (ten days)--that makes thirty-six; for the B*ri*hatî
consists of thirty-six syllables, and by means of the B*ri*hatî the gods
strove to reach heaven, and by the B*ri*hatî they did gain heaven; and
in like manner does this one, by means of the B*ri*hatî, now strive to
reach heaven, and thereby gain heaven; he who knows this secures for
himself whatever wish there is in the B*ri*hatî.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:3:2">12:2:3:2</span></span>2. And
as to the *K*aturvi*ms*a day, it is the same as either the seventh or
the ninth (day) of the Da*s*arâtra <span id="fr_468"></span>[1](#fn_468.md)
From out of the Abhiplava the P*ri*sh*th*ya is formed, from the
P*ri*sh*th*ya the Abhi*g*it,

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

from the Abhi*g*it the Svarasâmans, from the Svarasâmans the Vishuvat,
from the Vishuvat the Svarasâmans, from the Svarasâmans the
Vi*s*va*g*it, from the Vi*s*va*g*it the P*ri*sh*th*ya <span
id="fr_469"></span>[1](#fn_469.md), from the P*ri*sh*th*ya the Abhiplava,
from the Abhiplava the Go and Âyus, and from the Go and Âyus the
Da*s*arâtra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:3:3">12:2:3:3</span></span>3. And
that Mahâvrata is a winning-day, for its Stoma is the Pa*ñk*avi*ms*a,
and a metre does not collapse from (excess or deficiency of) a
syllable--neither from one nor from two (syllables); neither does a
Stoma by (an excess of) one hymn-verse <span
id="fr_470"></span>[2](#fn_470.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:3:4">12:2:3:4</span></span>4.
Prior to the Vishuvat they perform first the Abhiplava, and afterwards
the P*ri*sh*th*ya, for the Abhiplava represents the sons, and the
P*ri*sh*th*ya the father; whence in early life the sons subsist on (the
resources of) their father. Subsequent to the Vishuvat they perform
first the P*ri*sh*th*ya, and afterwards the Abhiplava; whence in later
life the father subsists on (the resources of) his sons; and, verily,
the sons of him who thus knows this subsist on him in early life, and he
subsists on his sons in later life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:3:5">12:2:3:5</span></span>5.
Here, now, they ask, 'If he were to die after entering on the
*K*aturvi*ms*a day, how does he become one who has not merely (uttered)
the

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Âgur-formula <span
id="fr_471"></span>[1](#fn_471.md)?' Let him say, 'In that they then
perform the Opening Atirâtra, thereby (he becomes such a one).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:3:6">12:2:3:6</span></span>6. As
to this they ask, 'Seeing that there are the twelve months of the year,
and that one day, to wit, the Vishuvat, is in excess, does this belong
to those (months) that go before or to those that follow?' Let him say,
'Both to those that go before and to those that follow;' for the
Vishuvat is the body (trunk) of the year, and the months are its limbs;
and where the body is there are (or, that includes) also the limbs, and
where the limbs are there is also the body; and neither is the body in
excess of the limbs, nor are the limbs in excess of the body: and thus,
indeed, that (day) belongs both to those (months) that go before and to
those that follow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:3:7">12:2:3:7</span></span>7. But,
indeed, that year is a great eagle: the six months which they perform
prior to the Vishuvat are the one wing, and those which they perform
subsequent thereto are the other; and the Vishuvat is the body; and,
indeed, where the body is there are also the wings, and where the wings
are there is also the body; for neither is the body in excess of the
wings, nor are the wings in excess of the body: and thus, indeed, that
(day) belongs both to those (months) that go before and to those that
follow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:3:8">12:2:3:8</span></span>8. As
to this they ask, 'Seeing that for six months prior to the Vishuvat
they- perform Stomas tending upwards, and for six (months) reversed

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Stomas), how are
these latter performed so as to tend upwards?' Let him say, 'In that
they perform that Da*s*arâtra as one with upward tending Stomas, thereby
they do so.' Now, the Mahâvrata did not yield itself to the gods saying,
'How is it, ye have performed the Vishuvat with upward tending hymns,
and me with reversed ones?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:3:9">12:2:3:9</span></span>9. The
gods said, 'Try ye to find out that sacrificial performance which has
upward tending Stomas, and whereby we may gain this.' They saw that
Da*s*arâtra with upward tending Stomas after the manner of the year:
what P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha there is in it that is the seasons, the
(three) *Kh*andomas are these worlds, and the tenth day is the year.
Thereby they gained this (Mahâvrata), and it yielded itself to them;
and, verily, the Mahâvrata yields itself to him who so knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:3:10">12:2:3:10</span></span>10.
And in this way, indeed, there is an ascent of days:--by means of the
Opening Atirâtra they ascend the concluding Atirâtra, by means of the
*K*aturvi*ms*a the Mahâvrata, by means of an Abhiplava a subsequent
Abhiplava, by means of a P*ri*sh*th*ya a subsequent P*ri*sh*th*ya, by
means of the Abhi*g*it the Vi*s*va*g*it, by means of the Svarasâmans the
subsequent Svarasâmans--but that one day is not ascended, to wit, the
Vishuvat: and, verily, he who thus knows this ascends to (the state of)
one more glorious, and no one inferior to him ascends (to be equal) to
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:3:11">12:2:3:11</span></span>11.
And in this way, indeed, there is a descent of days:--the Prâya*n*îya
Atirâtra descends to the *K*aturvi*ms*a day, the *K*aturvi*ms*a day to
the Abhiplava, the Abhiplava to the P*ri*sh*th*ya, the P*ri*sh*th*ya to
the Abhi*g*it, the Abhi*g*it to the Svarasâmans, the

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Svarasâmans to the
Vishuvat, the Vishuvat to the Svarasâmans, the Svarasâmans to the
Vi*s*va*g*it, the Vi*s*va*g*it to the P*ri*sh*th*ya, the P*ri*sh*th*ya
to the Abhiplava, the Abhiplava to the Go and Âyus, the Go and Âyus to
the Da*s*arâtra, the Da*s*arâtra to the Mahâvrata, the Mahâvrata to the
Udayanîya Atirâtra, the Udayanîya Atirâtra to the world of heaven, to
the resting-place, to plenty.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:3:12">12:2:3:12</span></span>12.
Such, indeed, are the wilds and ravines of sacrifice, and they (take)
hundreds upon hundreds of days’ carriage-drives; and if any venture into
them without knowledge, then hunger or thirst, evil-doers and fiends
harass them, even as fiends would harass foolish men wandering in a wild
forest; but if those who know this do so, they pass from one duty to
another, as from one stream into another, and from one safe place to
another, and obtain well-being, the world of heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:3:13">12:2:3:13</span></span>13.
As to this they say, 'How many onward, and how many backward days are
there?' Well, those which are performed once each are onward days, and
those which are performed repeatedly are backward days: let him at least
consider these <span id="fr_472"></span>[1](#fn_472.md) as backward ones,
for in accordance with the course of the Sha*d*ahas he himself moves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_467"></span>[155:2](sbe44051.htm#fr_467.md) The term
'ârkshyat' is apparently a future participle of 'â-ar*g*,' <span
id="page_156">p. 156</span> hence 'calculated to procure, or win.' The
Ait.-Br. has 'âkshyat' instead. The two Sha*d*ahas (or periods of six
days), here counted as such days, would seem to include the six
Svarasâman days, and the special named days scattered over the session
(the opening and concluding Atirâtra being apparently counted as one).

<span id="fn_468"></span>[156:1](sbe44051.htm#fr_468.md) *K*aturvi*ms*a day
is one in which the *K*aturvi*ms*a-stoma, or twenty-four-fold hymn-form,
is exclusively used in the chanting of the Stotras. The one usually
denoted by that term is the second day of the Gavâm ayanam. In the
Da*s*arâtra, or ten-days’ period, there is, however, likewise a day in
which the *K*aturvi*ms*a-stoma is used exclusively. That period consists
of a P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha (six days), three *Kh*andoma days, and a
final Atyagnish*t*oma, called Avivâkya. The three *Kh*andoma days (i.e.
days fashioned after metres) have assigned to them as their exclusive
Stomas the twenty-four-fold, the forty-four-fold, and the
forty-eight-fold hymn-forms respectively; the first of them, or the
seventh day of the Da*s*arâtra, being thus a *K*aturvi*ms*a day. But in
the second half of the year's session the regular order of the days of
the minor sacrificial periods--the Sha*d*ahas and Svarasâmans--is
reversed, the last day being performed first; and according to this
paragraph the same is optionally to be the case in regard to the three
*Kh*andoma days, the *K*aturvi*ms*a day being taken either first or last
(see, however, parag. 9). Cf. also Haug, Ait.-Br., Transl., p. 347, note
(where, in l. 3, read Da*s*arâtra instead of Dvâda*s*âha).

<span id="fn_469"></span>[157:1](sbe44051.htm#fr_469.md) Here, the order of
Abhiplava and P*ri*sh*th*ya followed in the first half of the year is
reversed.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[157:2](sbe44051.htm#fr_470.md) The author
apparently claims for the pa*ñk*avi*ms*a-stoma, or twenty-five-versed
hymn-form, the same efficacy as for the *k*aturvi*ms*a-stoma, the
hymn-form of what is practically the first day of the sacrificial
session (cf. Tâ*nd*ya-Br. XXV, 1, 1, where it is called
*K*aturvi*ms*a*m* prâya*n*îyam), and which by the number of its
stotriyâ-verses, being that of the half-months in the course of the year
(24), is supposed to represent the whole year; cf. Ait.-Br. IV, 52.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[158:1](sbe44051.htm#fr_471.md) See XI, 2, 5, 10
with note. (There is no paragraph XI, 2, 5, 10--JBH.) The Katurvi*ms*a
day is, as it were, a promise on the part of the Sacrificer to perform
the sacrificial session; whilst the Prâya*n*îya Atirâtra not only
represents the actual entering on the performance, but, as it were,
implies the Udayanîya Atirâtra ([XII, 2, 2,
18](sbe44050.htm#12:2:2:18).md).

<span id="fn_472"></span>[160:1](sbe44051.htm#fr_472.md) Or, 'meditate upon
these' (? worship these); see [p. 155](sbe44050.htm#page_155.md), note
[1](sbe44050.htm#fn_466.md).
