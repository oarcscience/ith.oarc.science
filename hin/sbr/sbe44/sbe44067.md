### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:1">12:7:3:1</span></span>1. By
means of the Surâ-liquor Namu*k*i, the Asura, carried off Indra's
(source of) strength, the essence of food, the Soma-drink. He (Indra)
hasted up to the A*s*vins and Sarasvatî, crying, 'I have sworn to
Namu*k*i, saying, "I will slay thee neither by day nor by night, neither
with staff nor with bow, neither with the palm of my hand nor with the
fist, neither with the dry nor with the moist!" and yet has he taken
these things from me: seek ye to bring me back these things!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:2">12:7:3:2</span></span>2. They
spake, 'Let us have a share therein, and we will bring them back to
thee.'--'These things

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (shall be) in
common to us,' he said, 'bring them back, then!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:3">12:7:3:3</span></span>3. The
A*s*vins and Sarasvatî then poured out foam of water (to serve) as a
thunderbolt, saying, 'It is neither dry nor moist;' and, when the night
was clearing up, and the sun had not yet risen, Indra, thinking, 'It is
neither by day nor by night,' therewith struck off the head of Namu*k*i,
the Asura.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:4">12:7:3:4</span></span>4.
Wherefore it has been said by the *Ri*shi (*Ri*g-veda S. VIII, 14, 13),
'With foam of water, Indra, didst thou sever the head of Namu*k*i, when
thou wert subduing all thine enemies.' Now, Namu*k*i is evil: having
thus, indeed, slain that evil, his hateful enemy, Indra wrested from him
his energy, or vital power. Let him who has an enemy perform the
Sautrâma*n*î: he thereby slays that evil, his hateful enemy, and wrests
from him his energy, or vital power. In his (Namu*k*i's) severed head
there was the Soma juice mixed with blood. They loathed it. They
perceived that (means of) drinking separately (one of) the two
liquids,--'King Soma, the drink of immortality, is pressed <span
id="fr_584"></span>[1](#fn_582);'--and having thereby made that (Soma.md)
palatable, they took it in (as food).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:5">12:7:3:5</span></span>5. With
(Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 1), 'Thee, the sweet (liquor I mix) with the sweet
(Soma),' he compounds (the ingredients for the preparation of) the
Surâ-liquor <span id="fr_585"></span>[2](#fn_583.md), and makes it
palatable;--'the strong

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

with the strong,' he thereby bestows energy on him (the
Sacrificer);--'the immortal with the immortal,' he thereby bestows life
on him 'the honeyed with the honeyed,' he thereby bestows flavour to it
(the liquor);--'I mix with the Soma,' he thereby makes it (the
Surâ-liquor) a form of Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:6">12:7:3:6</span></span>6.
'Thou art Soma: get thee matured for the A*s*vins! get thee matured for
Sarasvatî! get thee matured for Indra Sutrâman!' for these were the
deities who first prepared that sacrifice, and with their help he now
prepares it; and, moreover, he thereby provides these deities with their
share. He distils it with a view to (its being like) the Soma-pressing.
For three nights it remains standing, for the Soma remains standing for
three nights after it has been bought: he thus makes it a form of Soma.

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:7">12:7:3:7</span></span>7.
There are two Vedis <span id="fr_586"></span>[1](#fn_584.md)
(altar-grounds),--'Two worlds in truth there are,' they say, 'the world
of the gods, and the world of the Fathers.' One (of the Vedis) is in the
north, and the other in the south, for the world of the gods is in the
north, and the world of the Fathers in the south; by the northern one he
secures the world of the gods, by the southern one the world of the
Fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:8">12:7:3:8</span></span>8.
There are both milk and Surâ-liquor; for milk is Soma, and the
Surâ-liquor food: through the milk he secures the Soma-drink, and
through the Surâ-liquor food. And milk is the nobility (chieftaincy),
and Surâ-liquor the peasantry (clan); the milk he purifies after
purifying the Surâ-liquor: he thus produces the nobility from out of the
peasantry, for the nobility is produced from out of the peasantry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:9">12:7:3:9</span></span>9. With
(Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 3), 'Purified by Vâyu's

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

purifier is the backward-flowing, exceeding swift Soma,' he purifies
(the liquor <span id="fr_587"></span>[1](#fn_585).md) in the case of one
purged by Soma: in a suitable manner he thus purifies him (the
Sacrificer);--'Indra's faithful companion:' whatever energy, or vital
power, had passed away from him with that (Soma), that he now restores
to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:10">12:7:3:10</span></span>10.
With, 'Purified by Vâyu's purifier is the forward-flowing, exceeding
swift Soma,' he purifies (the liquor) in the case of one who has vomited
Soma: in a suitable manner he thus purifies him (the
Sacrificer);--'Indra's faithful companion:' whatever energy, or vital
power, had passed away from him with that (Soma), that he now restores
to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:11">12:7:3:11</span></span>11.
With (Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 4), 'She purifieth thy liquor,' he, for prosperity,
purifies (the Surâ) in the case of one wishing for prosperity;--'thy
Soma, she, the daughter of Sûrya:' the daughter of Sûrya (the sun)
assuredly is Faith, and by faith that (liquor) becomes Soma juice, and
by faith he makes it to be Soma-juice;--'with the perpetual tail,' for
with a tail-whisk that (liquor) is purified.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:12">12:7:3:12</span></span>12.
With (Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 5), 'The Brahman

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

and Kshatra he purifieth,' he purifies the milk <span
id="fr_588"></span>[1](#fn_586.md): he thus produces the Kshatra from out
of the Brahman, for from out of the priesthood the nobility is
produced;--'the fiery spirit and energy;' fiery spirit and energy, vital
power, he thus bestows on him;--'with the Surâ the Soma,' for with the
Surâ-liquor is Soma;--'the juice, is distilled,' for from the distilled
the juice is obtained;--'for joy,' to joy (intoxication), indeed, the
Soma juice contributes, and to joy also does the Surâ-liquor: he thus
secures both the joy of the Soma, and the joy of the Surâ;--'with the
pure juice, O god, satiate the deities!' that is, 'with the pure juice
satisfy thou the deities;'--'with sap bestow thou food on the
Sacrificer,' sap and food he thereby bestows on the Sacrificer. The cups
of milk are taken first, then the cups of Surâ-liquor: he thereby makes
the peasantry obedient to the nobility.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:13">12:7:3:13</span></span>13.
With (Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 6), 'Yea, even as the owners of barley cut their
barley <span id="fr_589"></span>[2](#fn_587). . .,' (the Adhvaryu.md) fills
(three) cups of milk,--barley-stalks are Soma-stems, and milk is Soma
juice: by means of Soma he thus makes it Soma-juice. With a single
(verse) he fills them: singly and solely on the Sacrificer he thus
bestows prosperity, for milk is prosperity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:14">12:7:3:14</span></span>14.
With (Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 7), 'Separately, indeed, a seat, acceptable to the
gods, hath been prepared for you two,' he fills the (three) cups

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

of Surâ-liquor; for separate, indeed, are the Soma-juice and the
Surâ-liquor; and 'acceptable to the gods' he says, because these two are
indeed acceptable to the gods; and 'separately a seat hath been
prepared' he says, because there are two altar-grounds;--'do not ye
mingle in the highest heaven!' he thereby keeps him (the Sacrificer)
from evil;--'the potent Surâ-liquor thou art,' he thereby makes Surâ to
be Surâ;--'and this is Soma,' he thereby makes Soma to be
Soma;--'entering thine own seat, injure me not!' he thereby turns it
(the Surâ-liquor) away to its own seat for his own safety. With a single
(verse) he fills them: singly and solely on the Sacrificer he thus
bestows fame, for the Surâ-liquor is fame.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:15">12:7:3:15</span></span>15.
Verily, the cups of milk are the nobility (chieftaincy), and the cups of
Surâ-liquor are the peasantry (clan): thus, were he to draw (the cups)
without interlinking them, he would detach the peasantry from the
nobility, and the nobility from the peasantry, and would cause confusion
between the higher and lower, and a failure of the sacrifice. He draws
them so as to be interlinked <span id="fr_590"></span>[1](#fn_588.md), and
thereby combines the peasantry with the nobility, and the nobility with
the peasantry, for the prevention of confusion between the higher and
lower, and for the success of the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:16">12:7:3:16</span></span>16.
And the cups of milk are the vital airs, and the cups of Surâ-liquor the
body: thus, were he

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

to draw (the cups) without interlinking them, he would detach the body
from the vital airs, and the vital airs from the body, and the
Sacrificer would be liable to perish. He draws them so as to be
interlinked, and thereby combines the body with the vital airs, and the
vital airs with the body; and, indeed, he also lays vital power (or
life) into him: whence he who has performed the Sautrâma*n*î, and even
he who thus knows this, attains the full (measure of) life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:17">12:7:3:17</span></span>17.
And the cups of milk are Soma, and the cups of Surâ-liquor food: thus,
in that both cups of milk and cups of Surâ-liquor are taken, he indeed
secures for himself both the Soma-drink and food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:18">12:7:3:18</span></span>18.
And the cups of milk are cattle, and the cups of Surâ-liquor food: thus,
in that both cups of milk and cups of Surâ-liquor are taken, he indeed
secures for himself both cattle and food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:19">12:7:3:19</span></span>19.
And the cups of milk are domestic animals, and the cups of Surâ-liquor
wild animals: thus, in that both cups of milk and cups of Surâ-liquor
are taken, he indeed secures for himself both domestic and wild animals.
And he mixes the cups of milk with both cultivated and wild-growing
(fruit), whereby both cultivated and wild-growing food is secured to the
domestic animals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:20">12:7:3:20</span></span>20.
As to this they say, 'In that there are those wild beasts, this is a
form of that cruel deity; and if he were to mix the cups of milk with
hairs of those beasts, he would thrust the cattle into the mouth of
Rudra, and the Sacrificer would be without cattle let him not mix them,
or cattle would not be secured by him, for Rudra is the ruler of
animals.' The cups of Surâ-liquor alone he mixes with hairs of those

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

beasts: he thus puts into the Surâ what belongs to Rudra, whence by
drinking Surâ-liquor one becomes of violent (raudra) mind; and on the
wild beasts alone he thus directs Rudra's shaft so as to insure safety
to the domestic animals; and cattle are secured by him and he does not
thrust the cattle into the mouth of Rudra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:21">12:7:3:21</span></span>21.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 10; 11,\] 'That dysentery which spareth both the tiger
and the wolf, the winged eagle and the lion, may it spare this
(Sacrificer) trouble!--Whereas, as a child, joyfully sucking, I chafed
my mother, so now, O Agni, I become freed from my debt: unharmed by me
are my parents.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:7:3:22">12:7:3:22</span></span>22.
With two eagle-feathers, the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthât*ri* purify the
Sacrificer, turned towards the cast behind the altar-ground <span
id="fr_591"></span>[1](#fn_589.md), both upwards and downwards,--this is a
form of the in-breathing and the upward breathing: the in-breathing and
the upward breathing he thereby secures; for both upwards and downwards
this breath passes along the body. With (Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 1I), 'Uniting ye
are: unite me with happiness <span id="fr_592"></span>[2](#fn_590.md)!' he
touches the cups of milk: with prosperity and fame he thereby endows
him. With, 'Disuniting ye are: disunite me from evil!' he touches the
cups of Surâ-liquor: he thereby keeps him from evil.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_582"></span>[223:1](sbe44067.htm#fr_584.md) Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 72
seq. On the myth cp. Muir, O. S. T., vol. v, p. 94.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[223:2](sbe44067.htm#fr_585.md) The preparation of
the Surâ is described in Kâty. XIX, i, 20-21 and comms., and by
Mahîdhara on Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 1, in the following way. Having purchased
(a) malted rice (*s*ashpa), malted barley (tokma), and fried rice
(lâ*g*â*h*), and (b) various vegetable substances (called with the
generic name of nagnahu) serving as spices and ferments, such as the
bark of Vatica robusta, three <span id="page_224">p. 224</span>
myrobalans (nutmeg, areca-nut, and cloves), ginger, hog-weed, &c., he
takes them into the fire-house, and pounds the two lots separately. He
then prepares two gruels or mashes of rice and millet respectively,
adding more water than is ordinarily used, puts them on the fire till
they boil over, and catches the overflowing water in two separate
vessels. He then acids thereto one-third part of the (still separate)
pounded malted rice and barley and fried rice (or one-sixth part into
each vessel), and likewise one-half of the spice (or one-fourth part
into each vessel): this mixture, called mâsara (serving both as malt and
as flavouring matter), is allowed to dry and is then pounded. One-half
of the remaining pounded malted rice and barley and fried rice, as well
as the whole of the remaining spices, is then, in equal parts, added to
the two mashes, which are thereupon poured into a large vessel, after
which the pounded 'mâsara' is mixed with the compound whilst the above
formula is pronounced; and the pot is deposited in a hole dug in the
south-western corner of the fire-shed (*s*âlâ), where it remains
standing for three days (and nights), during which the milk of one, two,
and three cows respectively, and the remaining quantities of malted and
fried grain are gradually added to it (see [XII, 8, 2,
8](sbe44069.htm#12:8:2:8)-[10](sbe44069.htm#12:8:2:10).md).

<span id="fn_584"></span>[225:1](sbe44067.htm#fr_586.md) The two Vedis are
prepared, in front of the Âhavanîya, by the Adhvaryu and
Pratiprasthât*ri* respectively in a way similar to those required for
the Varu*n*apraghâsâ*h*, see part i, p. 392, note. There is some space
between them, but not more than will allow a seat to stand on both Vedis
([XII, 8, 3, 6](sbe44070.htm#12:8:3:6).md). The dimensions (of the northern
altar-ground) are in accordance with those of the mahâvedi (measuring
thirty-six prakramas or steps long, twenty-four on the hind (west) side,
and thirty-six (or thirty) on the front (east) side), except that the
unit of measure, in this case, is one-third prakrama,--the area being
thus equal to one-ninth of the mahâvedi (some authorities, however,
making it one-third). Behind the two Vedis two mounds (khara) are thrown
up for the three cups of milk, or three cups of Surâ-liquor
respectively, to be deposited thereon. On the northern Vedi an
uttara-vedi (high-altar), occupying about one-third of its area, is
prepared, on which a sacrificial fire (taken from the Âhavanîya) is
afterwards laid down for the use of the Adhvaryu in making libations
from the cups of milk; another fire being laid down on the southern
mound for the use of the Pratiprasthât*ri* in making libations from the
cups of Surâ-liquor.

<span id="fn_585"></span>[226:1](sbe44067.htm#fr_587.md) This performance
thus takes place on the fourth day. Behind the mound of the southern
Vedi a hole is dug, and an ox-hide spread over it. On this skin the
unstrained liquor (parisrut) is either poured, a fine strainer (made of
bamboo) being then laid thereon so that the clear liquor percolates
through the holes, and the dregs remain below; or the strainer is placed
on the skin, and the unstrained liquor is poured on it so as to allow
the clear liquor to flow through on the skin. The liquor is then poured
into a pan (sata), and further purified by a whisk of cow and horse-hair
being drawn through it, or the liquor being strained through the hair.

<span id="fn_586"></span>[227:1](sbe44067.htm#fr_588.md) This takes place
on the northern Vedi, by means of a wooden (reed) vessel and a strainer
of goat's and sheep's hair.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[227:2](sbe44067.htm#fr_589.md) For the complete
verse, see V, 5, 4, 24.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[228:1](sbe44067.htm#fr_590.md) That is to say, in
drawing the cups he draws alternately a cup of milk, and a cup of Surâ;
Kâty. *S*r. XIX, 2, 21. According to ib. 22, the three cups of milk may,
however, be drawn first, and then the cups of liquor.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[230:1](sbe44067.htm#fr_591.md) That is, behind
the mahâ-vedi, near the anta*h*pâtya-peg, where the purchase of the
ingredients for the preparation of the Surâ had taken place.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[230:2](sbe44067.htm#fr_592.md) Cf. V, 1, 2, 18,
where the same two formulas are used whilst the Soma and Surâ-cups are
first held together, and then withdrawn from each other; and the terms
'samp*rik*' and 'vip*rik*' were accordingly taken in a passive sense,
'united' and 'disunited;' whilst here the active sense seems preferable,
the term 'vip*rik*' probably referring to the tendency of fiery liquor
for producing broils.
