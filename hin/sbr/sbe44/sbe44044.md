### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:4:1">11:8:4:1</span></span>1. Now,
once upon a time, a tiger killed the samrâ*g*-cow <span
id="fr_401"></span>[1](#fn_401) of those (who were sacrificing.md) with
(the king of the) Ke*s*in as their G*ri*hapati <span
id="fr_402"></span>[2](#fn_402.md). He (the king <span
id="fr_403"></span>[3](#fn_403).md) said to his fellow-sacrificers, 'What
atonement is there for this?' They replied, 'There is no atonement for
this: Kha*nd*ika Audbhâri alone knows an atonement for it; but he
certainly desires as much as this, and worse than this <span
id="fr_404"></span>[4](#fn_404), (to happen.md) to thee.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:4:2">11:8:4:2</span></span>2. He
said, 'Charioteer, put to my horses; I shall drive thither: if so be he
will tell me, I shall succeed (with my sacrifice); but if he will have
me die, I shall be shattered along with the shattered sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:4:3">11:8:4:3</span></span>3.
Having put to the horses, he drove off, and

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

came thither <span id="fr_405"></span>[1](#fn_405). When he (Kha*nd*ika.md)
saw <span id="fr_406"></span>[2](#fn_406.md) him, he said, 'Seeing that
there are those skins on deer, we break their ribs and cook them: the
skin of the black antelope is attached to my neck <span
id="fr_407"></span>[3](#fn_407.md)--is it with thoughts such as these that
thou hast dared to drive over to me?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:4:4">11:8:4:4</span></span>4. 'Not
so,' he replied; 'a tiger has killed my samrâ*g*-cow, reverend sir; if
so be thou wilt tell me, I shall succeed; but if thou wilt have me die,
I shall be shattered along with the shattered sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:4:5">11:8:4:5</span></span>5. He
said, 'I will take counsel with my counsellors <span
id="fr_408"></span>[4](#fn_408.md).' Having called them to counsel, he
said, 'If I tell him, his race, not mine, will prevail here <span
id="fr_409"></span>[5](#fn_409.md),

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

but I shall gain the (other) world; and if I do not tell him, my own
race, not his, will prevail here, but he will gain the (other) world.'
They said, 'Do not tell him, reverend sir, for, surely, this (the earth)
is the Kshatriya's world <span id="fr_410"></span>[1](#fn_410.md).' He
replied, 'Nay, I will tell him: there are more nights <span
id="fr_411"></span>[2](#fn_411.md) up yonder.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:4:6">11:8:4:6</span></span>6. And,
accordingly, he then said to him,--'Having offered the Sp*ri*tis <span
id="fr_412"></span>[3](#fn_412), he (the Adhvaryu.md) should say, "Drive up
another (cow)!" and that one should be thy samrâ*g*-cow <span
id="fr_413"></span>[4](#fn_413.md).'--'\[Having offered. with,\] "From the
moon I take thy mind, hail!--From the sun I take thine eye, hail!--From
the wind I take thy breathings, hail!--From the regions I take thine
ear, hail!--From the waters I take thy blood, hail!--From the earth

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I take thy body,
hail!" let him then say, "Drive up another (cow)!" and that one shall be
thy samrâg cow!' He then departed from thence <span
id="fr_414"></span>[1](#fn_414.md), and, verily, members of the Ke*s*in
race are born here even to this day.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_401"></span>[131:1](sbe44044.htm#fr_401.md) That is the cow
which supplies the milk for the Pravargya; this milk, when heated, being
called 'gharma (heat)' or 'samrâ*g* (sovereign king).' See part ii, p.
104, note 3.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[131:2](sbe44044.htm#fr_402.md) G*ri*hapati, or
house-lord, master of the house, is the title of the principal
sacrificer at a sacrificial session (sattra).--According to Sâya*n*a,
the Ke*s*ina*h* were a race of nobles (râ*g*âna*h*), who, on this
occasion, were performing a 'sattra,' and are therefore styled
'householders' (g*ri*hapati);--ke*s*ino nâma râ*g*âna*h* sattrayâgam
anutish*th*anto g*ri*hapataya âsu*h*, Sâya*n*a thus takes
'ke*s*i-g*ri*hapataya*h*,' not as a bahuvrîhi, but as a tatpurusha
(karmadhâraya, 'the Ke*s*in householders') which would, however, require
the accent on the second member of the compound.--Though all those
taking part in a sacrificial session ought to be Brahmans, the rule does
not seem to have been strictly observed. Cf. part iv, introd., p. xxv;
Weber, Ind. Stud. X, pp. 25 94.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[131:3](sbe44044.htm#fr_403.md) G*ri*hapatishu
pradhânabhûta*h* ke*s*irâ*g*a*h*, Sây.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[131:4](sbe44044.htm#fr_404.md) That is, that even
a greater misfortune should happen to thee,--atyanta*m* pâpayukta*m*
govadhâdidoshayuktam ity artha*h*, Sây.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[132:1](sbe44044.htm#fr_405.md) Sâya*n*a makes
Kha*nd*ika the subject of this last verb:--sa ha ratham a*s*vai*h*
sa*m*yo*g*ya Kha*nd*ikasamîpa*m* yayau; so<sup>ऽ</sup>pi Kha*nd*ika*h*
ke*s*inam â*g*agâma, gatvâ *k*a vivakta*m* (? vivikta*m*) Ke*s*ina*m*
pratikhyâya nirâk*ri*tya sadayam eva prathamam uvâ*k*a. He thus seems
not to allow here to 'yâ' the meaning of 'to drive,' but to take 'yayau'
in the sense of 'he went thither.' It might, of course, also mean 'he
set off.'

<span id="fn_406"></span>[132:2](sbe44044.htm#fr_406.md) Sâya*n*a
apparently takes 'prati-khyâ' in the sense of 'to refuse admittance to,
to reject,' 'abweisen.'

<span id="fn_407"></span>[132:3](sbe44044.htm#fr_407.md) Sâya*n*a's comment
on this passage is as follows:--'O Ke*s*in, the skin of the cow that
yields the gharma-milk is worn by thee on the neck: those (i.e.
suchlike) skins, indeed, are (i.e. are seen) on deer; and having broken
(i.e., torn to pieces) the "p*ri*sh*t*i" (i.e. the small-sized does)
amongst them we cook them: that black-antelope skin is fastened on my
neck.' Kha*nd*ika having spoken thus, the king said, 'No, this is not my
intention.'

<span id="fn_408"></span>[132:4](sbe44044.htm#fr_408.md) Literally, those
that should be consulted, whom further on Sâya*n*a calls 'âptâ*h*' or
trusty men.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[132:5](sbe44044.htm#fr_409.md) Or, perhaps, the
people here (the Ke*s*ins) will become his, not mine; cf. Delbrück,
Altind. Syntax, pp. 32; 141 (two different renderings). Sâya*n*a, on the
other hand, takes 'pra*g*â,' not in the sense either of 'family' or
'people,' but in that of '(sacred) knowledge'--perhaps with reference to
the threefold science (the Veda) as the <span id="page_133">p.
133</span> thousandfold progeny of Vâ*k*, speech (cf. IV, 5, 8, 4; 6, 7,
3; V, 5, 5, 12)--which Kha*nd*ika would thus lose, whilst, by imparting
the sacred knowledge, he would gain a seat in heaven.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[133:1](sbe44044.htm#fr_410.md) Sâya*n*a's comment
is not very intelligible, the MS. being more than usually corrupt on
this last page:--eva*m*vidhe virodha udbhâvitê sati to âptâ û*k*u*h*, he
bhagavo vidyâ*m* mâ vo*k*a*h*, kshatriyasya loko na bhavishyatîti; nanu
tavânu*s*aya*h* (? appanage, domain, following) sa tasya nâsti; aya*m*
vâva ayam eva khalu, kshatriyasya lokas tasmât sauspatrâter (?) evam
ukte sati sadve*k*enarâpatra bhavânti (!) ato vakshyâmy evety uvâ*k*a.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[133:2](sbe44044.htm#fr_411.md) That is, days,--by
giving up a brief life of earthly power and glory, he gains eternal
life.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[133:3](sbe44044.htm#fr_412.md) That is, oblations
performed with a view of 'taking hold (sp*ri*)' of something; cf. Katy.
*S*rautas. XXV, 6, 11. 12.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[133:4](sbe44044.htm#fr_413.md) The particle 'iti'
here causes some difficulty of construction which would be removed by
the latter clause being taken as part of the Adhvaryu's speech; though
Kâtyâyana, it is true, does not recognise it as such. Perhaps, however,
Kha*nd*ika's speech ends here, and what follows up to 'that one shall be
thy samrâ*g*-cow' has to be taken as a ritualistic insertion, in which
case the final 'iti' would have some such meaning as 'having been told
thus.'

<span id="fn_414"></span>[134:1](sbe44044.htm#fr_414.md) Sâya*n*a takes
this thus:--'Thus instructed, Ke*s*in disappeared (or, passed away,
vanished, utsasâda vinash*t*a*h*) from that region (tato
de*s*ât)'--after which there is a lacuna in the MS. Perhaps, however, it
is Kha*nd*ika, rather than Ke*s*in, to which this refers,--he (and his
race) then, indeed, passed away from that region, whilst the Ke*s*ins
flourished.
