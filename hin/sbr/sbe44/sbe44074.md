# THIRTEENTH KÂ*ND*A.

#### THE A*S*VAMEDHA, OR HORSE-SACRIFICE.

#### PRELIMINARY CEREMONIES <span id="fr_680"></span>[1](#fn_676.md).

### FIRST ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:1:1">13:1:1:1</span></span>1. He
(the Adhvaryu) cooks the priests’ mess of rice <span
id="fr_681"></span>[2](#fn_677.md): it is seed he thereby produces. Having
greased a rope with the ghee which is left over <span
id="fr_682"></span>[3](#fn_678), he takes it; for ghee is (a type of.md)
fiery spirit, and the horse is sacred to Pra*g*âpati <span
id="fr_683"></span>[4](#fn_679.md): he thus endows Pra*g*âpati with fiery
spirit. Impure, and unfit for sacrifice, indeed, is that (animal), to
wit, the horse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:1:2">13:1:1:2</span></span>2. The
rope consists of darbha grass (poa cynosuroides);--for darbha
stalks <span id="fr_684"></span>[5](#fn_680.md) are a means of
purification: he thus purifies that (horse), and immolates it as one
purified and meet for sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:1:3">13:1:1:3</span></span>3. Now,
when the horse <span id="fr_685"></span>[6](#fn_681.md) was immolated, its

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

seed went from it and became gold <span id="fr_686"></span>[1](#fn_682.md):
thus, when he gives gold (to the priests) he supplies the horse with
seed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:1:4">13:1:1:4</span></span>4.
Pra*g*âpati produced the sacrifice <span
id="fr_687"></span>[2](#fn_683.md). His greatness departed from him, and
entered the great sacrificial priests <span
id="fr_688"></span>[3](#fn_684.md). Together with the great priests he went
in search of it, and together with the great priests he found it: when
the great priests eat the priests’ mess of rice, the Sacrificer thereby
secures for himself the greatness of the sacrifice. Along with the
priests’ mess of rice he presents gold (to the priests); for the mess of
rice is seed, and gold is seed: by means of seed he thus lays seed into
that (horse, and Sacrificer). It (the gold <span
id="fr_689"></span>[4](#fn_685)) weighs a hundred (grains.md); for man has
a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred energies: it is life, and
energy, vigour, he lays into his own self. At midday he takes
Vasatîvarî <span id="fr_690"></span>[5](#fn_686.md) water of four kinds; it
is brought together from the (four) quarters, for food is in (all) the
(four) quarters, and water is food: by means of food he thus secures
food for him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_676"></span>[274:1](sbe44074.htm#fr_680.md) The ceremonies
treated of in the first six chapters (brâhma*n*as) refer to the setting
apart of the horse for its sacred office, a year before the sacrifice,
and to the intervening period during which the horse is allowed to roam
about, though under careful supervision.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[274:2](sbe44074.htm#fr_681.md) For further
particulars regarding this opening ceremony of the sacrifice see [XIII,
4, 1, 1](sbe44102.htm#13:4:1:1.md) seqq.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[274:3](sbe44074.htm#fr_682.md) Viz. from the ghee
used for greasing the four dishes of cooked rice.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[274:4](sbe44074.htm#fr_683.md) Or, the horse is
of the nature of Pra*g*âpati.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[274:5](sbe44074.htm#fr_684.md) See above, [p.
195](sbe44061.htm#page_195), note [1](sbe44061.htm#fn_532.md).

<span id="fn_681"></span>[274:6](sbe44074.htm#fr_685.md) That is, as would
seem, Pra*g*âpati in the form of a horse, see part iv, introd., p. xiv
seqq.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[275:1](sbe44074.htm#fr_686.md) Pra*g*âpati is
Agni, and gold is Agni's seed, cf. II, 1, 1, 5; III, 3, 1, 3 &c.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[275:2](sbe44074.htm#fr_687.md) That is, the
A*s*vamedha sacrifice, and thus the immolation (or emptying out) of his
own self, so to speak.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[275:3](sbe44074.htm#fr_688.md) That is, the four
principal officiating priests, Brahman, Hot*ri*, Adhvaryu, and
Udgât*ri*. Cf. VIII, 4, 3, 1 seqq., where it is the vital airs that, in
their capacity as *Ri*shis, assist Pra*g*âpati in the first sacrifice.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[275:4](sbe44074.htm#fr_689.md) That is to say,
each piece of gold weighs as much. According to Kâty. XX, 1, 6 he is to
give to the priests 4000 cows and as many *S*atamâna coins.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[275:5](sbe44074.htm#fr_690.md) For this water
used for the Soma-sacrifice where, however, it is taken from a cistern,
or some course of flowing water, see part ii, p. 222 seqq.
