### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:5:1">13:2:5:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati poured forth the life-sap of the horse (a*s*va-medha); when
poured forth it went from him. Having become fivefold <span
id="fr_787"></span>[2](#fn_783) it entered the year, and they (the five
parts) became those half-months <span id="fr_788"></span>[3](#fn_784).
He followed it up by means of the fifteenfold (sets of victims <span
id="fr_789"></span>[4](#fn_785)), and found it; and having found it, he
took possession of it by means of the fifteenfold ones; for, indeed,
they--to wit, the fifteenfold (sets)--are a symbol of the half-months,
and when he seizes the fifteenfold ones, it is the

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

half-months the Sacrificer thereby takes possession of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:5:2">13:2:5:2</span></span>2.
Concerning this they say, 'But, surely, the year is not taken possession
of by him who spreads out (performs sacrifice for) a year in any other
way than by means of the Seasonal sacrifices <span
id="fr_790"></span>[1](#fn_786).' The Seasonal sacrifices, doubtless,
are manifestly the year; and when he seizes the Seasonal victims <span
id="fr_791"></span>[2](#fn_787), he then manifestly takes possession of
the year. ‘And, assuredly, he who spreads out the year in any other way
than with the (victims) of the set of eleven <span
id="fr_792"></span>[3](#fn_788) (stakes) is deprived of his offspring
(or

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

subjects) and cattle, and fails to reach heaven. This set of eleven
(stakes), indeed, is just heaven <span id="fr_793"></span>[1](#fn_789),
and the set of eleven (stakes) means offspring (or people) and cattle
and when he lays hands on the (victims) of the (two) sets of eleven
(stakes) he does not fail to reach heaven, and is not deprived of his
offspring and cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:5:3">13:2:5:3</span></span>3.
Pra*g*âpati created the Virâ*g*; when created, it went away from him,
and entered the horse meet for sacrifice. He followed it up with sets of
ten <span id="fr_794"></span>[2](#fn_790)

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (beasts). He found
it, and, having found it, he took possession of it by means of the sets
of ten: when he seizes the sets of eleven (beasts), the Sacrificer
thereby takes possession . of the Virâ*g*. He seizes a hundred, for man
has a life of a hundred (years) and a hundred energies: vital power and
energy, vigour, he thus takes to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:5:4">13:2:5:4</span></span>4.
Eleven decades <span id="fr_795"></span>[1](#fn_791) he seizes, for the
Trish*t*ubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trish*t*ubh means
energy, vigour: thus it is for the obtainment of energy, vigour. Eleven
decades he seizes, for in an animal there are ten vital airs, and the
body: (trunk) is the eleventh: he thus supplies the animals with vital
airs. They belong to all the gods for the completeness of the horse
(sacrifice), for the horse belongs to all the gods. They are of many
forms, whence beasts are of many forms; they are of distinct forms,
whence beasts are of distinct forms.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_783"></span>[308:2](sbe44087.htm#fr_787) Or the Paṅkti
metre, consisting of five octosyllabic pâdas.

<span id="fn_784"></span>[308:3](sbe44087.htm#fr_788) Viz. as consisting
of thrice five days.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[308:4](sbe44087.htm#fr_789) See above, [XIII,
2, 2, 11](sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:11).

<span id="fn_786"></span>[309:1](sbe44087.htm#fr_790) On this point, cp.
II, 6, 3, 1.--'Verily, imperishable is the righteousness of him who
offers the Seasonal sacrifices; for such a one gains the year, and hence
there is no cessation for him. He gains it in three divisions, he
conquers it in three divisions. The year means the whole, and the whole
is imperishable (without end). Moreover, he thereby becomes a Season,
and as such goes to the gods; but there is no perishableness in the
gods, and hence there is imperishable righteousness for him.'

<span id="fn_787"></span>[309:2](sbe44087.htm#fr_791) The *K*âturmâsyas
are the victims enumerated Vâ*g*. S. XXIV, 14-19. The first six of them
are the last (of the set of fifteen) bound to the thirteenth stake;
whilst the remaining victims make up all the seven sets of fifteen
victims bound to remaining stakes (14-21)--thus amounting to 121
domesticated animals, cf. [XIII, 5, 1, 13](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:13), seq.
In counting the stakes the central one is the first, then follows the
one immediately south, and then the one immediately north of it, and
thus alternately south and north. The reason why the name '*K*âturmâsya'
is applied to the victims here referred to is that the deities for whose
benefit they are immolated are the same, and follow the same order, as
those to whom (the chief) oblations are made at the Seasonal sacrifices
(viz. the constant ones--Agni, Soma, Savit*ri*, Sarasvatî, Pûshan, and
special ones, see II, 5, 1, 8-17; 5, 2, 7-16; 5, 3, 2-4; 5. 4, 2-10; 6,
1, 4-6; 6, 2, 9; 6, 3, 4-8).

<span id="fn_788"></span>[309:3](sbe44087.htm#fr_792) That is to say, he
who seeks to gain the year by immolating only the Seasonal victims, and
the sets of fifteen victims, and does not offer likewise the victims of
the set (or rather two sets) of eleven <span id="page_310">p. 310</span>
stakes. These two sets of eleven victims, tied to the twenty-one stakes
(two being tied to the central stake), are to constitute the regular
'savanîyâ*h* pa*s*ava*h*' of the pressing-days of the A*s*vamedha; and
in [XIII, 5, 1, 3](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:3), and [5, 3,
11](sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:11), the author argues against those who (on the
first, and third days) would immolate only twenty-one such victims, all
of them sacred to Agni. As regards the second day, the author does not
mention these particular victims, but this an scarcely be interpreted as
an approval of twenty-one such victims, even though the number
twenty-one certainly plays an important part on that day--seeing that
Kâtyâyana, XX, 4, 25, makes the two sets of eleven victims the rule for
all three days. For the third day, on the other hand, the author of the
Brâhma*n*a ([XIII, 5, 3, 11](sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:11)) actually
recommends the immolation of twenty-four bovine victims as 'savanîyâ*h*
pa*s*ava*h*.' The deities of the first set of eleven victims (as perhaps
also of the second set of the first day) are the same as those of the
ordinary 'ekâda*s*inî' (see III, 9, 1, 62 1; and Vâ*g*. S. XXIX, 58),
whilst the second set (of the second day, at all events) has different
deities (Vâ*g*. S. XXIX, 60). On the central day these victims are added
to the sets of fifteen victims bound there to each of the twenty-one
stakes; the mode of distribution being the same as on the other two
days, viz., so that the first victim of each set--that is the one
devoted to Agni--is bound to the central stake, whilst of the remaining
twenty victims one is assigned to each stake.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[310:1](sbe44087.htm#fr_793) Viz. inasmuch as
the stakes stand right in front (to the east) of the sacrificial fire
and ground, and the Sacrificer would thus miss the way to heaven if he
were not to pass through the 'ekâda*s*inî.'

<span id="fn_790"></span>[310:2](sbe44087.htm#fr_794) The Virâ*g* metre
consists of (three) decasyllabic pâdas.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[311:1](sbe44087.htm#fr_795) After the (349)
domesticated animals have been secured to the stakes, sets of thirteen
wild beasts are placed on the (twenty) spaces between the (twenty-one)
stakes, making in all 260 wild beasts. From the 150th beast onward
(enumerated Vâ*g*. S. XXIV, 30-40) these amount to 111 beasts which here
are called eleven decades; the odd beast not being taken into account,
whilst in [paragraph 3](sbe44087.htm#13:2:5:3) above the first ten
decades are singled out for symbolic reasons. These beasts are spread
ever the twelfth (only the last seven Beasts of which belong to the
first decade) and following spaces.
