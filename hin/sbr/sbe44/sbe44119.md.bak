### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:1">14:1:3:1</span></span>1. Now
at the time when he there <span id="fr_1220"></span>[2](#fn_1212.md)
proceeds with the guest-meal, he who intends to perform the Pravargya,
prior to the Upasads <span id="fr_1221"></span>[3](#fn_1213.md), spreads
Ku*s*a grass with its tops directed towards the east, in front of the
Gârhapatya, and places the vessels thereon in pairs <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[4](#fn_1214),--the Upayamanî (tray.md) and the
Mahâvîra (pot), the pair of lifting-sticks <span
id="fr_1223"></span>[5](#fn_1215.md), the

<span id="page_459">p. 459</span>

two milking-bowls, the two Rauhi*n*a-plates, the two offering spoons for
the Rauhi*n*a (cakes), and whatever other (implement) there is,--these
make ten, for the Virâ*g* consists of ten syllables, and the sacrifice
is Virâ*g*: he thus makes this to be equal to the Virâ*g*, the
sacrifice. And as to their being in pairs,--a pair means strength, for
when two take hold of each other they exert strength; and a pair
(couple) means a productive union: with a productive union he thus
supplies and completes it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:2">14:1:3:2</span></span>2. Then
the Adhvaryu takes the (lustral) sprinkling water, and, stepping up,
says, 'Brahman, we shall proceed: Hot*ri*, sing praises!' for the
Brahman is seated on the right (south) side as the guardian of the
sacrifice: to him he thus says, 'Sit thou undistracted: we are about to
restore the head of the Sacrifice;' and 'Hot*ri*, sing praises!' he
says, because the Hot*ri* is the sacrifice: he thus thereby says to him,
'Restore the head of the sacrifice!' and accordingly the Hot*ri* begins
to recite--

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:3">14:1:3:3</span></span>3.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 3,\] ‘The Brahman, firstborn from afore <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[1](#fn_1216.md),--the Brahman, doubtless, is yonder

<span id="page_460">p. 460</span>

sun, and he is born day by day from afore (in the east); and the
Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore
he says, 'The Brahman (n.), firstborn from afore.' He then sprinkles
(the vessels): the import of this is the same as before <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[1](#fn_1217.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:4">14:1:3:4</span></span>4. He
sprinkles (the chief Mahâvîra) with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 11), 'For Yama
thee!'--Yama, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, for it is he who
controls (yam) everything here, and by him everything here is
controlled; and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus
gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For Yama (I sprinkle) thee.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:5">14:1:3:5</span></span>5. 'For
Makha thee!'--Makha, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, and the
Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore
he says, 'For Makha thee.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:6">14:1:3:6</span></span>6. 'For
Sûrya's heat thee!'--Sûrya, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, and the
Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore
he says, 'For Sûrya's heat thee.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:7">14:1:3:7</span></span>7.
Having taken out a post <span id="fr_1226"></span>[2](#fn_1218.md) by the
front door (of the *s*âlâ), he drives it into the ground on the south
side (of the *s*âlâ <span id="fr_1227"></span>[3](#fn_1219).md), so that
the Hot*ri*, whilst singing praises, may look upon it; for the Hot*ri*
is the sacrifice, and he thereby restores the sacrifice to this (earth),
and she causes the Gharma (milk) to rise.

<span id="page_461">p. 461</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:8">14:1:3:8</span></span>8.
Having turned round the Emperor's throne-seat <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[1](#fn_1220.md) in front of the Âhavanîya, he places
it south thereof, and north of the King's (Soma's) throne-seat <span
id="fr_1229"></span>[2](#fn_1221.md), so as to face the east.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:9">14:1:3:9</span></span>9. It
is made of Udumbara wood, for the Udumbara means strength: with
strength, with vital sap, he thus supplies and completes it (the
Pravargya).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:10">14:1:3:10</span></span>10.
It is shoulder-high, for on the shoulders this head is set: he thus sets
the head upon the shoulders.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:11">14:1:3:11</span></span>11.
It is wound all over with cords <span id="fr_1230"></span>[3](#fn_1222.md)
of Balva*g*a grass (Eleusine indica). When the sacrifice had its head
cut off, its vital sap flowed out, and thence these plants grew up: with
that life-sap he thus supplies and completes it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:12">14:1:3:12</span></span>12
And as to why he places it north (of Soma's seat),--Soma is the
sacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head; but the head is higher
(uttara): therefore he places it north (uttara) of it. Moreover, Soma is
king, and the Pravargya is emperor, and the imperial dignity is higher
than the royal: therefore he places it north of it <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[4](#fn_1223.md).

<span id="page_462">p. 462</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:13">14:1:3:13</span></span>13.
And when the Hot*ri* recites this (verse, Rig-v. V, 43, 7), 'Whom the
priests anoint, as if spreading him . . .,' he anoints that Mahâvîra
which is to be used, all over with ghee <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[1](#fn_1224.md), with, 'May the god Savit*ri* anoint
thee with honey!' for Savit*ri* is the impeller of the gods, and honey
means everything whatever there is here: he thus anoints it (or him) all
over with everything here, and Savit*ri*, as the impeller, impels it for
him,--this is why he says, 'May the god Savit*ri* anoint thee with
honey!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:14">14:1:3:14</span></span>14.
Now sand has been strewed <span id="fr_1233"></span>[2](#fn_1225.md) on the
north side of it: below that he (previously) throws (a plate of) white
gold <span id="fr_1234"></span>[3](#fn_1226.md), with, 'Protect it from
contact with the earth!' For at that time the gods were afraid lest the
Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs from below;
and that, to wit, gold, being Agni's seed, it (serves) for repelling the
fiends, the Rakshas. But, indeed, the Earth also was afraid of this lest
this (Pravargya), when heated and glowing <span
id="fr_1235"></span>[4](#fn_1227.md), might injure

<span id="page_463">p. 463</span>

her: he thus keeps it separate from her. White it is, for white, as it
were <span id="fr_1236"></span>[1](#fn_1228.md), is this earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:15">14:1:3:15</span></span>15.
And when the Hot*ri* recites this (verse, Rig-v. I, 36, 9), 'Sit thee
down: thou art great . . .,' sheaths of reed-grass are kindled on both
sides <span id="fr_1237"></span>[2](#fn_1229.md), and throwing them (on the
mound), he puts (the Mahâvîra pot) thereon. When the sacrifice had its
head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and therefrom these plants grew
up: with that life-sap he thus supplies and completes it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:16">14:1:3:16</span></span>16.
And as to why they are kindled on both sides: he thereby repels the
Rakshas, the fiends, from all the quarters. Whilst this (pot) is being
heated, the (Sacrificer's) wife covers her head, thinking, 'Lest this
one, when heated and glowing, should rob me of my eyesight,' for it
indeed becomes heated and glowing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:17">14:1:3:17</span></span>17.
He puts it on with, 'Flame thou art, glow thou art, heat thou art;'--for
the Gharma is he who shines yonder, and he indeed is all that: it is him
he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'Flame thou art, glow thou
art, heat thou art.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:18">14:1:3:18</span></span>18.
He (the Sacrificer) then invokes blessings on this (earth) <span
id="fr_1238"></span>[3](#fn_1230), for the sacrifice is this (earth.md): it
is thus (whilst being) on her that he invokes blessings, and she fulfils
them all for him.

<span id="page_464">p. 464</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:19">14:1:3:19</span></span>19.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 12,\] 'Unmolested thou art in front (in the
east),'--for unmolested by the Rakshas, the fiends, indeed, this (earth)
is in front;--'in Agni's over-lordship,'--he thus makes Agni her
over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant thou
life unto me!'--he thus secures life for himself, and accordingly he
attains the full (term of) life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:20">14:1:3:20</span></span>20.
'Possessed of sons towards the south,'--in this there is nothing hidden,
so to speak;--'in Indra's over-lordship,'--he thus makes Indra her
over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant thou
offspring unto me!'--he thus secures offspring and cattle for himself,
and accordingly he becomes possessed of sons and of cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:21">14:1:3:21</span></span>21.
'Well to live on behind (towards the western region),'--in this there is
nothing hidden, so to speak;--'in god Savit*ri*'s over-lordship;'--the
god Savit*ri* he thus makes her over-lord for the warding off of the
fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant thou eyesight unto me!'--he thus secures
eyesight for himself, and accordingly he becomes possessed of eyesight.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:22">14:1:3:22</span></span>22.
'A sphere of hearing towards the north,'--'causing (sacrificial calls)
to be heard <span id="fr_1239"></span>[1](#fn_1231.md),' is what he thereby
means to say;--'in the creator's over-lordship,'--the creator he thus

<span id="page_465">p. 465</span>

makes her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;
'grant thou prosperity (increase) of wealth unto me!'--wealth,
prosperity, he thus secures for himself, and accordingly he becomes
wealthy and prosperous.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:23">14:1:3:23</span></span>23.
'Disposition above,'--'disposing <span id="fr_1240"></span>[1](#fn_1232.md)
above' is what he thereby means to say;--'in B*ri*haspati's
over-lordship,'--B*ri*haspati he thus makes her over-lord for the
warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant me vigour!'--vigour he
thereby secures to himself, and accordingly he becomes vigorous, strong.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:24">14:1:3:24</span></span>24.
On the right (south) side (of the Mahâvîra) he (the Sacrificer) then
makes amends by (laying down) the hand with the palm upwards, with,
'Shield me from all evil spirits!' whereby he means to say, 'Protect me
from all troubles!' When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its
life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers, but the Fathers are three
in number <span id="fr_1241"></span>[2](#fn_1233.md): it is with these that
he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:25">14:1:3:25</span></span>25.
Thereupon, whilst touching her (the earth) <span
id="fr_1242"></span>[3](#fn_1234.md),

<span id="page_466">p. 466</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Thou art Manu's
mare,' for, having become a mare, she (the earth) indeed carried Manu,
and he is her lord, Pra*g*âpati: with that mate, his heart's delight, he
thus supplies and completes him (Pra*g*âpati, the Pravargya, and
Sacrificer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:26">14:1:3:26</span></span>26.
He then lays pieces of (split) Vikaṅkata wood round (the Mahâvîra), two
pointing to the east <span id="fr_1243"></span>[1](#fn_1235.md), with
(Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 13), 'Hail! be thou encompassed by the Maruts!'--the
call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last <span
id="fr_1244"></span>[2](#fn_1236.md); for the call of 'hail!' is he who
shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus
gratifies; and hence he places the call of 'hail!' first, and the deity
last.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:27">14:1:3:27</span></span>27.
'Be thou encompassed by the Maruts,' he says; for the Maruts are the
(common) people: he thus surrounds the nobility by the people, whence
the nobility here is surrounded on both sides by the people. Silently
(he lays down) two pointing to the north <span
id="fr_1245"></span>[3](#fn_1237), silently (again.md) two pointing to the
east, silently two pointing to the north, silently two pointing to the
east.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:28">14:1:3:28</span></span>28.
He makes them to amount to thirteen, for there are thirteen months in
the year, and the

<span id="page_467">p. 467</span>

year is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it
is him he thus gratifies, and hence he makes them to amount to thirteen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:29">14:1:3:29</span></span>29.
He then places a gold plate (weighing a hundred grains) on the top (of
the pot), with, 'Protect it from contact with the sky!' For at that time
the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that
(Pravargya) of theirs from above; and that--to wit, gold--being Agni's
seed, it (serves) for repelling the fiends, the Rakshas. But, indeed,
the Sky also was afraid of this lest this (Pravargya), when heated and
glowing, might injure it: he thus keeps it separate therefrom. It is
yellow, for yellow, as it were, is the sky.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:30">14:1:3:30</span></span>30.
He (the Adhvaryu) then fans (the fire) thrice by means of (three)
fans <span id="fr_1246"></span>[1](#fn_1238.md), whilst muttering, 'Honey!'
each time; for honey means breath: he thus lays breath into it. Three
(fans) there are, for there are three breathings, the out (and
in)-breathing, the up-breathing and the through-breathing: it is these
he thus lays into it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:31">14:1:3:31</span></span>31.
They then fan it thrice <span id="fr_1247"></span>[2](#fn_1239.md) in the
non-sunwise way. When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap
flowed away, and went to the Fathers,--the Fathers being three in
number <span id="fr_1248"></span>[3](#fn_1240.md): with them he thus
supplies it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:32">14:1:3:32</span></span>32.
But, indeed, the breathings depart from those who perform the fanning at
the sacrifice. They

<span id="page_468">p. 468</span>

fan again thrice in the sunwise way,--this makes six; and six in number
are these breathings (vital airs) in the head: it is these he thus lays
into it. They cook the two Rauhi*n*a (cakes). When a blaze is produced,
he takes off the gold (plate).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:33">14:1:3:33</span></span>33.
And when the Hot*ri* recites this (verse, Rig-v. I, 112, 24),
'Successful, O A*s*vins, make ye our voice,' the Adhvaryu steps up, and
says, 'The Gharma is aglow <span id="fr_1249"></span>[1](#fn_1241.md).' If
it be aglow, he may know that the Sacrificer will become more
prosperous; and if it be not aglow, he may know that he will become
poorer; and if it be neither aglow nor the reverse, he may know that he
(the Sacrificer) will become neither more prosperous nor poorer: but
indeed (the pot) should be fanned so (long) as to be aglow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:3:34">14:1:3:34</span></span>34.
And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya)
enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as
at the creation <span id="fr_1250"></span>[2](#fn_1242.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1212"></span>[458:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1220.md) That is, at the
Soma-sacrifice, of the preliminary day (upavasatha) of which the
guest-meal to, or hospitable reception (âtithya) of, King Soma forms
part (see part ii, p. 85 seqq.). The assumption here is, that the
performance of the Pravargya takes place on that day before the
Pressing-day, whilst in reality it has been performed for at least two
days before that.

<span id="fn_1213"></span>[458:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1221.md) See III, 4, 4,
1. The Upasads are performed twice daily, for at least three days, up to
the day before the Soma-sacrifice; and if the Pravargya is to be
performed likewise, it precedes immediately each performance of the
Upasad. Cf. also [XIV, 3, 1, 1](sbe44123.htm#14:3:1:1.md) with note.

<span id="fn_1214"></span>[458:4](sbe44119.htm#fr_1222.md) Prior to this,
the doors of the *s*âlâ are to be closed, to keep the Mahâvîra from
being seen; see [p. 452](sbe44118.htm#page_452.md), note
[2](sbe44118.htm#fn_1194.md). The entire performance of the Pravargya
indeed has to be kept secret from the eyes of unauthorised persons.

<span id="fn_1215"></span>[458:5](sbe44119.htm#fr_1223.md) The
'parî*s*âsau' (also called '*s*aphau,' [XIV, 2, 1,
16](sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:16).md) are two <span id="page_459">p. 459</span>
pieces of wood or laths apparently fastened together by a kind of clasp
(or a cord) at one end, so as to serve the purpose of a pair of tongs
(parî*s*âsau sa*m*da*ms*âkârau, comm. on Kâty. XXVI, 2, to) for taking
up the Mahâvîra pot, which must not be handled in any other way.
According to Haug, Ait. Br., Transl., p. 51, they are placed underneath
the pot in lifting it, but this seems very improbable, seeing that, at
the end of the sacrifice, the Adhvaryu, by means of them, turns the pot
upside down so as to pour the remainder of its contents into the
offering spoon (see Kâty. XXIV, 6, 17 with comm.); nor could the
blackened pot in that way be cleansed properly and placed on the
supporting tray ([XIV, 2, 1,
16](sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:16)-[17](sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:17).md).

<span id="fn_1216"></span>[459:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1224.md) For the complete
verse, see VII, 4, 1, 14. For the complete <span id="page_460">p.
460</span> series of texts recited by the Hot*ri*, see Ait. Br. I, 19
seqq.; Â*s*v. *S*r. IV, 6.

<span id="fn_1217"></span>[460:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1225.md) Viz. he makes
the vessels sacrificially pure (I, 3, 3, 1).

<span id="fn_1218"></span>[460:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1226.md) For tying the
cow that is to furnish the milk for the Gharma. Near it a peg is driven
into the ground to tie the goat to whose milk is to be used afterwards.

<span id="fn_1219"></span>[460:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1227.md) That would be,
south of the southern door (Âpast. XV, 6,-23).

<span id="fn_1220"></span>[461:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1228.md) The Pravargya is
styled 'samrâ*g*,' or universal king, emperor; as distinguished from
King Soma, for whose seat, reaching only up to the navel, see III, 3, 4,
26 seqq. (Cf. also that of the Ukhya Agni, which is only a span high,
VI, 7, I, 1, 22 seqq.)--For a similar attribution of imperial dignity
(sâmrâ*g*ya)--as well as royal dignity (râ*g*ya)--to him who is
consecrated by the Sautrâma*n*î (where the seat used is knee-high), see
[XII, 8, 3, 4](sbe44070.htm#12:8:3:4.md) seqq.

<span id="fn_1221"></span>[461:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1229.md) Âpast. XV, 6, 10
places it in front (east) of the seat for Soma.

<span id="fn_1222"></span>[461:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1230.md) Cf. [XII, 8, 3,
6](sbe44070.htm#12:8:3:6.md).

<span id="fn_1223"></span>[461:4](sbe44119.htm#fr_1231.md) According to
Katy. XXVI, 2, 27 (Âpast. XV, 6, II), the black antelope-skin is then
spread over the seat, and the two unused Mahâvîra pots (as well as the
reserve piece of clay and the spade, Katy.) placed thereon.

<span id="fn_1224"></span>[462:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1232.md) Katy. XXVI, 2, 4
refers to the pot as 'containing ghee (â*g*yavant),' which the comm.
takes to mean 'filled with consecrated ghee;' whilst Âpast. XV, 7, 5
leaves the option between greasing it (a*ñg*) and filling it (abhipûr)
with ghee. It would doubtless, at all events, be abundantly greased
inside.

<span id="fn_1225"></span>[462:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1233.md) North of the
Gârhapatya and the Âhavanîya in the *s*âlâ two mounds (khara) are
formed, covered with (or consisting of) sand. The one north of the
latter fire is here alluded to.

<span id="fn_1226"></span>[462:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1234.md) That is, a
silver plate weighing a hundred grains.

<span id="fn_1227"></span>[462:4](sbe44119.htm#fr_1235.md) Though
'tapta*h*' and '*s*u*s*u*k*âna*h*' are here translated as if they were
actually co-ordinate predicates, I am not sure whether we should not
rather take the passage to mean,--that this glowing one, when heated; or
rather, this one when heated so as to be glowing. Cf. [XIV, 2, 1,
18](sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:18); [3, 1, 14](sbe44123.htm#14:3:1:14.md), where I
prefer to subordinate one of the participles to the other.

<span id="fn_1228"></span>[463:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1236.md) I read,
'ra*g*ateva'; cf. the corresponding 'hari*n*îva hi dyau*h*,' [XIV, 1, 3,
29](sbe44119.htm#14:1:3:29.md).

<span id="fn_1229"></span>[463:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1237.md) That is, by
dividing the sheaths in the middle lengthwise, and lighting both halves
in the Gârhapatya fire.

<span id="fn_1230"></span>[463:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1238.md) According to
Katy. XXVI, 3, 5 he makes a span (of thumb and index)--or spreads his
hand with the palm downwards--over the pot whilst muttering the
respective formulas; apparently changing the position of the hand
according to the point of the compass referred to in the formula.

<span id="fn_1231"></span>[464:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1239.md) Or, calling for
the '*s*rausha*t*'; cf. part i, p. 131, note 2. The masculine form of
the participle is somewhat peculiar as the term it is meant to explain
refers to the earth. It has probably to be understood in the sense of,
'where he (viz. the Adhvaryu) calls for the *s*rausha*t*.' Mahîdhara
explains the term 'â*s*ruti' by 'where they, the priests, utter the
sacrificial calls,' i.e. 'meet for sacrifice.'

<span id="fn_1232"></span>[465:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1240.md) Here the
masculine gender can hardly be understood otherwise than in the sense
'where (B*ri*haspati, or Brahman) disposes on high.' Mahîdhara takes no
notice of this interpretation of the Brâhma*n*a, but explains
'vidh*ri*ti' as either 'one who upholds (dhârayati) in an especial
manner,' or where 'the offering spoon, &c., is held upwards
(uparish*t*âd dhriyate,--? who holds it upwards),'--an explanation which
can hardly commend itself.

<span id="fn_1233"></span>[465:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1241.md) This
specification of the number seems to have no other object but that of
limiting the general term of 'Fathers,' or deceased ancestors, to the
specific signification it has at the *S*râddha, where offering is made
to the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.

<span id="fn_1234"></span>[465:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1242.md) According to
Katy. XXVI, 3, 8, he does so whilst spanning the earth north of the
Mahâvîra pot.

<span id="fn_1235"></span>[466:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1243.md) That is, along
the north and the south sides of the pot, on the burning sheaths of reed
grass; or rather on hot cinders heaped thereon. Katy. XXVI, 3, 9. They
would partly serve the purpose of the ordinary (three) enclosing-sticks;
and Âpast., indeed, calls them 'paridhi.'

<span id="fn_1236"></span>[466:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1244.md) Literally, the
call of 'hail!' (svâhâ-kâra) he makes to be the nearer, and the deity
the farther.

<span id="fn_1237"></span>[466:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1245.md) That is, along
the west and the east sides of the pot. According to Âpast. *S*r. XV, 8,
1-4, two pieces of wood are laid down alternately by the Adhvaryu and
the Pratiprasthât*ri*, the last pieces being then laid down (on the
south side) by the former priest.

<span id="fn_1238"></span>[467:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1246.md) They consist of
pieces cut from the black antelope-skin (with black and white hair,
according to Âpast. XV, 5,12), fastened to sticks.

<span id="fn_1239"></span>[467:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1247.md) That is, the
Adhvaryu, Pratiprasthât*ri*, and Agnîdh then take each one of the fans,
and move round the fire whilst keeping it on their left side (the Agnîdh
going in front).

<span id="fn_1240"></span>[467:3](sbe44119.htm#fr_1248.md) See [p.
465](#page_465), note [2](#fn_1233.md).

<span id="fn_1241"></span>[468:1](sbe44119.htm#fr_1249.md) That is,
apparently, red-hot, glowing (*s*u*k*ita), or perhaps, entirely ablaze,
enveloped in flames--outside as well as inside, owing to the ghee with
which it was greased all over; hence hardly, 'bestrahlt' (illumined
shone upon), as the St. Petersb. Dict. takes it; cf. *s*u*s*u*k*âna,
[XIV, 2, 1, 18](sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:18.md); [3, 1,
14](sbe44123.htm#14:3:1:14.md). According to Âpast. *S*r., the three
priests, having completed their circumambulation, sit down on the east,
south, and north side respectively, and continue to fan the pot, at the
same time oiling it with ghee, until the pot is ablaze, when the
Adhvaryu takes off the gold plate. According to Kâty., on the other
hand, the Pratiprasthât*ri* proceeds with the baking of the cakes,
whilst the Adhvaryu sprinkles the pot with ghee each time that the
Hot*ri*, in his recitation, utters the syllable 'om' at the end of a
verse. Before the last verse, the twenty-fifth, of the same hymn
concluding the first part of the recitation, a special verse, IX, 83, 3,
is inserted. Â*s*v. *S*r. IV, 6, 2-3.

<span id="fn_1242"></span>[468:2](sbe44119.htm#fr_1250.md) See [p.
458](sbe44118.htm#page_458), note [1](sbe44118.htm#fn_1211.md).
