### EIGHTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:8:1">13:1:8:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati poured forth the life-sap of the horse <span
id="fr_737"></span>[2](#fn_733). When poured forth, it weighed down the
*rik* (hymn-verse) and the sâman (hymn-tune). The Vai*s*vadeva
(offerings) upheld that (A*s*vamedha): thus, when he offers the
Vai*s*vadevas, it is for the upholding of the A*s*vamedha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:8:2">13:1:8:2</span></span>2. With
(Vâ*g*. S. XXII, 20), 'To Ka hail! To the Who hail! To the Whoever
hail!' he makes the one relating to Pra*g*âpati the first (or chief
one), and thus upholds (the A*s*vamedha) by means of the deities with
Pra*g*âpati as their chief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:8:3">13:1:8:3</span></span>3.
'Hail, meditation (we give) unto him meditated upon! Hail, the mind unto
the Lord of creatures! Hail, thought unto him, the known <span
id="fr_738"></span>[3](#fn_734)!' what the mystic sense of the former
(utterances <span id="fr_739"></span>[4](#fn_735)) was that it is here.

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:8:4">13:1:8:4</span></span>4. 'To
Aditi hail! To Aditi, the mighty, hail! To Aditi, the most merciful,
hail!' Aditi, doubtless, is this (earth): it is by her that he upholds
it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:8:5">13:1:8:5</span></span>5. 'To
Sarasvatî hail! To Sarasvatî, the pure, hail! To Sarasvatî, the great,
hail!' Sarasvatî, doubtless, is speech: by speech he thus upholds it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:8:6">13:1:8:6</span></span>6. 'To
Pûshan hail! To Pûshan, the protector of travellers, hail! To Pûshan,
the watcher of men, hail!' Pûshan, doubtless, is cattle: by means of
cattle he thus upholds it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:8:7">13:1:8:7</span></span>7. 'To
Tvash*tri* hail! To Tvash*tri*, the seminal, hail! To Tvash*tri*, the
multiform hail!' Tvash*tri*, doubtless, is the fashioner of the couples
of animals: by means of forms he thus upholds it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:8:8">13:1:8:8</span></span>8. 'To
Vish*n*u hail! To Vish*n*u, the protector of what grows <span
id="fr_740"></span>[1](#fn_736), hail! To Vish*n*u, the bald <span
id="fr_741"></span>[2](#fn_737), hail!' Vish*n*u, doubtless, is the
sacrifice: by sacrifice he thus upholds it. With (Vâ*g*. XXII, 21), 'Let
every mortal espouse the friendship of the divine guide, . . . <span
id="fr_742"></span>[3](#fn_738),' he offers last of all a full
(-spoon)-oblation; for the full-offering is this (earth): he thus
finally establishes himself on this (earth).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_733"></span>[292:2](sbe44081.htm#fr_737) See [p.
289](sbe44079.htm#page_289), note [1](sbe44080.htm#fn_726). It is here
taken to be represented by the Ya*g*us:--a*s*vamedha*m*
ya*g*urâtmakavigrahavanta*m* s*ri*sh*t*avân, Harisv.--the larger number
of sacrificial formulas used at the performances being too heavy for the
recited and chanted texts.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[292:3](sbe44081.htm#fr_738) Mahîdhara takes
'âdhim âdhîtâya' in the sense of 'âdhâna*m* prâptâya' (who has obtained
a consecrated fire); and 'mana*h* pra*g*âtaye' in the sense of 'manasi
vartamânâya p.' (to P. who is in our mind); and '*k*itta*m* vi*gñ*âtâya'
in the sense of 'sarveshâ*m* *k*ittasâkshi*n*e' (to the witness, or
knower, of all men's thoughts).

<span id="fn_735"></span>[292:4](sbe44081.htm#fr_739) Harisvâmin
probably is right in supplying 'vyâh*ri*tînâm;' though possibly
'devatânâm' (deities) may be understood.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[293:1](sbe44081.htm#fr_740) The meaning of
'nibhûyapa' is doubtful; Mahîdhara explains it by 'nitarâm bhûtvâ
matsyâdyavatâra*m* k*ri*tvâ pâti.' Perhaps it may mean 'condescending
protector,' though one expects a direct object with 'pa.'

<span id="fn_737"></span>[293:2](sbe44081.htm#fr_741) The word
'*s*ipivish*t*a,' as applied to Vish*n*u, is likewise of doubtful
meaning. The native dictionaries assign both the meaning 'bald' and
'leprous' (or, affected with skin-disease) to it; whilst the first part
'*s*ipi' is taken variously by commentators as meaning 'cattle,' or
'ray,' or 'water,' or 'living being.'

<span id="fn_738"></span>[293:3](sbe44081.htm#fr_742) See III, 1, 4, 18;
VI, 6, 1, 21; and [p. 294](sbe44082.htm#page_294), note
[1](sbe44082.htm#fn_739).
