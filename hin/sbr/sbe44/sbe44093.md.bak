### ELEVENTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:11:1">13:2:11:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati desired, 'Would that I were great, and more numerous!' He
perceived those two Mahiman (greatness) cups of Soma at the A*s*vamedha;
he offered them; and thereby, indeed, became great and more numerous:
hence whosoever should desire to become great, and more numerous, let
him offer up those two Mahiman cups of Soma at the A*s*vamedha; and he
indeed becomes great and more numerous.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:11:2">13:2:11:2</span></span>2. He
offers them on both sides (before and after) the omentum;--the
A*s*vamedha, doubtless, is the Sacrificer, and that Mahiman (cup) is the
king: it is with royal dignity he thus encompasses him on both sides.
Some gods have the svâhâ-call ('hail') in front, and the other gods have
the svâhâ-call behind <span id="fr_838"></span>[2](#fn_834.md): it is them
he thus gratifies. With 'Hail

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

to the gods!' and 'To the gods hail!' he makes offering by means of the
king (Soma) on both sides of the omentum: he thereby gratifies those
gods who are in this world, and those who are in the other, and thus
gratified, both these kinds of gods lead him to the heavenly world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_834"></span>[327:2](sbe44093.htm#fr_838.md) The formula
uttered whilst the first Mahiman cup is offered runs thus (Vâ*g*. S.
XXIII, 2): 'What greatness of thine there hath <span id="page_328">p.
328</span> been in the day and the year; what greatness of thine there
hath been in the wind and the air; what greatness of thine there hath
been in the heavens and the sun, to that greatness of thine, to
Pra*g*âpati, hail, to the gods!' whilst that of the second Mahiman cup
runs thus (XXIII, 4): 'What greatness of thine there hath been in the
night and the year; what greatness of thine there hath been in the earth
and the fire; what greatness of thine there hath been in the Nakshatras
(lunar asterisms) and the moon, to that greatness of thine, to
Pra*g*âpati, to the gods, hail!' cf. [XIII, 5, 2,
23](sbe44107.htm#13:5:2:23); [3, 7](sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:7.md).
