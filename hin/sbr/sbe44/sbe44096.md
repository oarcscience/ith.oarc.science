### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:3:1">13:3:3:1</span></span>1.
Inasmuch as there are three Anush*t*ubh verses <span
id="fr_849"></span>[3](#fn_845) (on the first day), therefore the horse,
when standing, stands on three (feet); and inasmuch as (they are made
into) four Gâyatrî verses, therefore the horse, when stepping out,
scampers off on all (four) feet. For that Anush*t*ubh, doubtless, is the
highest metre, and the horse is the highest of animals; and the
Katush*t*oma is the highest of Stomas: by means of what is highest he
thus causes him (the Sacrificer) to reach the highest position.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:3:2">13:3:3:2</span></span>2. The
*S*akvarî verses are the (Hot*ri*'s) P*ri*sh*th*a (of the second day):
there is a different metre for

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

each (verse), for different Stomas are performed on each (day). And as
to the *S*akvarî verse being the P*ri*sh*th*a (-stotra), it is for the
completeness of the horse (sacrifice).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:3:3">13:3:3:3</span></span>3. The
central day is an Ekavi*ms*a one, for the Ekavi*ms*a is yonder sun, and
so is the A*s*vamedha by means of its own Stoma he thus establishes it
in its own deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:3:4">13:3:3:4</span></span>4. The
Vâmadevya is the Maitrâvaru*n*a's Sâman <span
id="fr_850"></span>[1](#fn_846); for the Vâmadevya is Pra*g*âpati, and
the horse is of Pra*g*âpati's nature: he thus supplies it with its own
deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:3:5">13:3:3:5</span></span>5. The
Pârthura*s*ma is the Brahma-sâman <span id="fr_851"></span>[2](#fn_847);
for the horse is restrained by means of reins <span
id="fr_852"></span>[3](#fn_848) (ra*s*mi), but when unrestrained,
unchecked, and unsteadied, it would be liable to go to the furthest
distance: thus when the Pârthura*s*ma is the Brahma-sâman, it is for the
safe keeping of the horse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:3:6">13:3:3:6</span></span>6. The
Sa*m*k*ri*ti <span id="fr_853"></span>[4](#fn_849) is the A*kh*âvâka's
Sâman;--

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

that A*s*vamedha, indeed, is, as it were, a disused sacrifice, for what
is performed thereof, and what is not <span
id="fr_854"></span>[1](#fn_850)? When the Sa*m*k*ri*ti is the
A*kh*âvâka's Sâman, it is for (bringing about) the completeness of the
horse (sacrifice). The last day is an Atirâtra with all the (six)
Stomas, in order to his (the Sacrificer's) obtaining everything, for an
Atirâtra with all the Stomas is everything, and the A*s*vamedha is
everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:3:7">13:3:3:7</span></span>7. The
fire-altar is the twenty-one-fold one <span
id="fr_855"></span>[2](#fn_851), the Stoma the twenty-one-fold one, and
there are twenty-one sacrificial stakes; even as bulls or
stallions <span id="fr_856"></span>[3](#fn_852) would clash together, so
do these Stomas <span id="fr_857"></span>[4](#fn_853), the

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

twenty-one-versed, run counter to one another: were he to bring them
together, the Sacrificer would suffer harm, and his sacrifice would be
destroyed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:3:8">13:3:3:8</span></span>8.
There may, indeed, be a twelvefold altar, and eleven stakes. When the
altar is a twelvefold one--twelve months being a year--it is the year,
the sacrifice, he obtains. When there are eleven stakes, then that
Virâ*g* (metre), the Ekâda*s*inî <span id="fr_858"></span>[1](#fn_854),
is contrived; and that which is its eleventh (stake) is its teat:
thereby he milks it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:3:9">13:3:3:9</span></span>9. As
to this they say, 'If there were a twelvefold altar, and eleven stakes,
it would be as if one were to drive on a cart drawn by one beast.' There
are the twenty-one-fold altar, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and twenty-one
stakes: that is as when one drives with side-horses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:3:10">13:3:3:10</span></span>10.
That twenty-one-fold one, indeed, is the head of the sacrifice; and,
verily, he who knows three heads on the A*s*vamedha, becomes the head of
kings. There are the twenty-one-fold altar, the twenty-one-fold Stoma,
and twenty-one stakes: these are the three heads on the A*s*vamedha;
and, verily, he who thus knows them becomes the head of kings. And,
indeed, he who knows the three tops on the A*s*vamedha, becomes the top
of kings;--there are the twenty-one-fold altar, the twenty-one-fold
Stoma, and twenty-one stakes: these, indeed, are the three tops on the
A*s*vamedha; and, verily, he who thus knows them becomes the top of
kings.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_845"></span>[332:3](sbe44096.htm#fr_849) That is, for the
Bahishpavamâna-stotra of the *K*atush*t*oma, see [p.
329](sbe44094.htm#page_329), note.

<span id="fn_846"></span>[333:1](sbe44096.htm#fr_850) That is, the
hymn-tune of the second P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra chanted for the
Maitrâvaru*n*a (who responds thereto by the recitation of the second
Nishkevalya-*s*astra): the Mahâ-Vâmadevya on the text 'kayâ na*s*
*k*itra bhuvat' (S. V. II, 32-34; figured for chanting in Bibl. Ind. ed.
III, p. 89) is ordinarily used for this stotra both in the Agnish*t*oma,
and in the Ukthya, form of sacrifice.

<span id="fn_847"></span>[333:2](sbe44096.htm#fr_851) That is, the tune
of the third, or Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin's, P*ri*sh*th*astotra. For the
sâmans commonly used for this stotra see part ii, p. 434, note 1. The
Pârthura*s*ma-sâman may be chanted on either of the texts Sâmav. II,
352-4 (figured ed. Bibl. Ind. vol. V, p. 395) or II, 355-7 (figured vol.
V, p. 483). It is the latter text which is to be used on the present
occasion. On the legendary origin of this sâman (which is said to
represent 'strength,' and therefore to be appropriate to a Râ*g*anya)
see Tâ*nd*ya-Br. XIII, 4, 17.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[333:3](sbe44096.htm#fr_852) Or, is fastened by
means of a rope.

<span id="fn_849"></span>[333:4](sbe44096.htm#fr_853) The
Sa*m*k*ri*ti-sâman is used with the texts Sâmav. II, 663-4 (figured ed.
Bibl. Ind. V, p. 407), II, 669-70 (ib. p. 482, wrongly <span
id="page_334">p. 334</span> called Sa*m*gati), and II, 679-82 (ib. p.
515). It is probably the second of these texts that is to be used here,
as it is also used for the same stotra on the second day of the
Garga-trirâtra.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[334:1](sbe44096.htm#fr_854) Cp. the
corresponding passage, Taitt. S. V, 4, 12, 3, 'that A*s*vamedha, indeed,
is a disused sacrifice, for, say they, who knows if the whole of it is
performed or not?' Perhaps, however, 'utsanna-ya*gñ*a' rather means 'a
decayed sacrifice,' i.e. one which has lost (or in the usual performance
is apt to lose) some of its original elements; whence the 'Sa*m*k*ri*ti'
tune is to be used for the purpose of 'making up' the lost parts. Part
of the commentary in this passage is not clear to
me:--uk*k*ai*h*kalâpagrâmâdau siddhasthâne satrasthito
granthato<sup>ऽ</sup>rthata*s* *k*a yat ya*gñ*a utsannaya*gñ*a esha
ya*h* a*s*vamedha*h* katham utsanna ity ata âha, ki*m* vâ hîti, yasya
dharmâ*h* pûrvayonau (? pûrvayuge) prayu*g*yante teshâ*m* kim*k*it kalau
kriyate ki*mk*in na kriyate, tata*s* *k*a sa*m*k*ri*tir a*kh*âvâkasâma
bhavati.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[334:2](sbe44096.htm#fr_855) That is, an altar
measuring twenty-one man's lengths on each of the four sides of its
body.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[334:3](sbe44096.htm#fr_856) The commentary
seems to take both '*ri*shabha' and 'v*ri*shan' here in the sense of
'bulls,' but cp. Taitt. Br. III, 8, 22, 1, 'yathâ vâ a*s*vâ varshabhâ vâ
v*ri*shâ*n*a*h* *s*a*m* sphurera*n*'--'even as if male horses or bulls
were to clash together.'

<span id="fn_853"></span>[334:4](sbe44096.htm#fr_857) That is, not only
the twenty-one-fold Stoma, but also the other two twenty-one-fold
objects, looked upon as Stomas (lit. 'means of praise').

<span id="fn_854"></span>[335:1](sbe44096.htm#fr_858) Viz. the set of
eleven (stakes), here represented as a cow; but in order to assimilate
it to the Virâ*g*, or metre consisting of ten syllables, the eleventh
stake is made the teat or udder of the cow.
