### THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE SETTING OUT OF THE PRAVARGYA.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:1">14:3:1:1</span></span>1. Now,
on the third, or the sixth, or the twelfth day <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[2](#fn_1292.md), having combined (the two performances
of) the Pravargya and Upasads <span id="fr_1302"></span>[3](#fn_1293.md),
he 'sets out <span id="fr_1303"></span>[4](#fn_1294.md)' the Pravargya, for
set out (removed), as it were, is this head (from the trunk). Having
gathered together all around it <span id="fr_1304"></span>[5](#fn_1295.md)
(the Mahâvîra pot), they

<span id="page_494">p. 494</span>

meet together upon the Vedi in the *S*âlâ, (entering) by the front door.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:2">14:3:1:2</span></span>2. The
Âgnîdhra then brings three bundles of faggots to the Âhavanîya, and
kindling one of them, he offers (thereon) whilst holding it <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1](#fn_1296) on a level with (the Sacrificer's.md)
mouth. When the sacrifice had its head cut off its heat went out of it,
and entered these worlds: it is with that heat he thus supplies and
completes it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:3">14:3:1:3</span></span>3. And
as to why (it is held) on a level with the mouth,--well, what is level
with the mouth is, as it were, above; and above, as it were, is yonder
(heavenly) world: thus he thereby supplies and completes it (the
Pravargya) with that heat which had entered yonder world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:4">14:3:1:4</span></span>4. \[He
offers, with Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 18,\] 'What heavenly fire of thine there
is, O Gharma,'--just the fire which is heavenly;--'what is in the
Gâyatrî and in the Havirdhâna,'--

<span id="page_495">p. 495</span>

just that which is in the Gâyatrî (metre) and Havirdhâna (shed);--'may
that (fire) of thine increase and become firm: to that (fire) of thine,
hail!' in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:5">14:3:1:5</span></span>5.
Then, having kindled the second (bundle), he offers (thereon) whilst
holding it navel-high; for in the middle, as it were, is what is
navel-high, and in the middle, as it were, is the air-world: thus he
thereby supplies and completes it with that heat which had entered the
air-world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:6">14:3:1:6</span></span>6.
'What fire of thine is in the air,'--just the fire which is in the
air;--'what is in the Trish*t*ubh and in the Âgnîdhra,' just that which
is in the Trish*t*ubh (metre) and Âgnîdhra (fire-shed);--'may that
(fire) of thine increase and become firm: to that (fire) of thine,
hail!' in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:7">14:3:1:7</span></span>7.
Then, having put the third (bundle) on the fire, he offers on it whilst
sitting; for below, as it were, is he who is sitting; and below, as it
were, is this (terrestrial) world: thus the thereby supplies and
completes it with that heat which had entered this (terrestrial) world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:8">14:3:1:8</span></span>8.
'What fire of thine is in the earth,'--just that fire which is in the
earth;--'what is in the *G*agatî and in the Sadas,' just that which is
in the *G*agatî (metre) and the Sadas (shed);--'may that (fire) of thine
increase and become firm: to that (fire) of thine, hail!' in this there
is nothing hidden, so to speak.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:9">14:3:1:9</span></span>9. He
(the Adhvaryu) then steps out <span id="fr_1306"></span>[1](#fn_1297.md),
with

<span id="page_496">p. 496</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Vâ*g*. S.
XXXVIII, 19), 'Thee (we will follow) for the protection of the
Kshatra,'--for he who shines yonder <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1](#fn_1298.md) is indeed the divine ruler: 'for the
protection of this human ruler,' he thereby means to say;--'guard thou
the Brahman's body!'--that is to say, 'preserve thou the Brahman's
person (âtman);'--'Thee (we will follow) as a stay for the Vi*s*,'--the
Vi*s* (people, clan) doubtless is the sacrifice: 'for the safety of the
sacrifice,' he thus means to say;--'we will follow to new
prosperity,'--it is for the safety and the stability of the sacrifice
that the says this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:10">14:3:1:10</span></span>10.
He then says (to the Prastot*ri*), 'Sing the Sâman!' or 'Recite the
Sâman!' but let him rather say, 'Sing the Sâman!' for they indeed sing
the Sâman. When he sings the Sâman it is in order that the fiends, the
Rakshas, should not injure these

<span id="page_497">p. 497</span>

outside the sacrifice, the body; for the Sâman is a repeller of the
fiends, the Rakshas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:11">14:3:1:11</span></span>11.
He sings it on a (verse) relating to Agni, for Agni is the repeller of
the Rakshas. On an Ati*kkh*andas (verse) he sings it, for that--to wit,
the Ati*kkh*andas (redundant metre) is all metres, therefore he sings it
on an Ati*kkh*andas (verse).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:12">14:3:1:12</span></span>12.
He sings <span id="fr_1308"></span>[1](#fn_1299.md), 'Agni burneth,
encountereth with flames, Ahâvo! Ahâvo <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[1](#fn_1299.md)!'--it is thus he repels the fiends,
the Rakshas, from here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:13">14:3:1:13</span></span>13.
They walk out (from the sacrificial ground) northwards <span
id="fr_1310"></span>[2](#fn_1300.md), along the back of the pit and the
front side of the Âgnîdhra (fire-house)--for this is the gate of the
sacrifice--and proceed in whatever direction from there water is (to be
found).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:14">14:3:1:14</span></span>14.
Let him 'set out' that (Pravargya) on an island; for, when heated, it
becomes burning-hot <span id="fr_1311"></span>[3](#fn_1301.md); and were he
to set it out on this (earth), its heat would enter this (earth); and
were he to set it out on water, its heat would enter the water; but when
he sets it out on an island--thus, indeed, it does not injure either the
water or this (earth), for inasmuch as he does not throw it into the
water, it does not injure the water; and inasmuch as the water flows all
round it--water being a means

<span id="page_498">p. 498</span>

of soothing--it does not injure this (earth): let him therefore set it
out on an island.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:15">14:3:1:15</span></span>15.
But let him rather set it out on the Uttaravedi <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[1](#fn_1302.md); for the Uttara-vedi is the sacrifice,
and the Pravargya is its head: he thus restores to the sacrifice its
head.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:16">14:3:1:16</span></span>16.
The first Pravargya (pot) he sets out so as to be close to (the front
side of) the navel (of the Uttara-vedi), for the northern (upper) navel
is the voice, and the Pravargya is the head: he thus places the voice in
the head.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:17">14:3:1:17</span></span>17.
\[He does so, with Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 20,\] 'The
four-cornered,'--four-cornered, indeed, is he who shines yonder, for the
quarters are his corners: therefore he says, 'Four-cornered';--

<span class="margnote"><span
id="14:3:1:18">14:3:1:18</span></span>18. --'Mighty navel of the divine
order,'--the divine order being the truth, he thereby means to say, 'The
mighty navel of the truth;'--'that mighty one (be) unto us of all
life;'--'that mighty one (be) unto us (a bestower) of the complete (term
of) life,' he thereby means to say <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[2](#fn_1303.md);

<span id="page_499">p. 499</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:19">14:3:1:19</span></span>19.
--'from the hatred, from the guile,'--in this there is nothing hidden,
so to speak;--'of him of another law, let us free ourselves!'--another
law, indeed, is his (Pravargya's and the Sun's), and another that of
men <span id="fr_1314"></span>[1](#fn_1304.md): therefore he says, 'Of him
of another law, let us free ourselves.' In this way the other two (pots
are placed) east of it: this is threefold, for the head is
threefold <span id="fr_1315"></span>[2](#fn_1305.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:20">14:3:1:20</span></span>20.
In front thereof (he places) the reserve (lump of) clay, whereby he puts
flesh upon it (Pravargya); on the two sides thereof the two
lifting-sticks, whereby he gives two arms to it; and on the two sides
yet further away the two Rauhi*n*a offering-ladles, whereby he gives two
hands to it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:21">14:3:1:21</span></span>21.
On the left (north) side (he places) the spade, for there is its place
of rest; on the right (right) side the imperial throne, for there is its
place of rest; on the left side the black antelope-skin, for there is
its place of rest; on all sides (save the front side) the fans, for, the
fans being the vital airs, he thereby bestows vital airs on it; there
are three of them, for there are three vital airs, the out- (and in-)
breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: it is these he
thus bestows on him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:22">14:3:1:22</span></span>22.
He then puts the cords and halter on the supporting-tray, and places
(the latter) behind (the

<span id="page_500">p. 500</span>

navel) with its point towards the east: a belly he thus gives to it. On
the two sides thereof the two milking-bowls (pinvana): two testicles he
thereby gives to it, for by means of his testicles the male overflows
(pinv). Behind (them he places) the post and peg: whereby he gives two
thighs to it; behind (them) the two Rauhi*n*a-plates, whereby he gives
two knees to it; and as to their being single plates, it is because
these knees consist, as it were, of single plates (bones). Behind (them)
the two poking-sticks (dh*ri*sh*t*i), whereby he gives two feet to it,
for with the feet one strikes out boldly (dh*ri*sh*t*am). On the left
side the two mounds <span id="fr_1316"></span>[1](#fn_1306.md) used in the
performance,. for there is their place of rest; on the right side the
Mâr*g*âlîya <span id="fr_1317"></span>[2](#fn_1307.md), for there is its
place of rest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:23">14:3:1:23</span></span>23.
He then pours milk into that (chief pot), with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 21),
'This, O Gharma, is the contents of thy bowels,'--the contents of the
bowels being food, it is food he thus puts into it;--'Grow thou, and
fill out thereby!'--in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak;--'and
may we ourselves grow, and fill out!'--it is a blessing he thereby
invokes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:24">14:3:1:24</span></span>24.
Let him not pour in all (the milk), lest the food should turn away from
the Sacrificer.--He leaves over half of it or more; and on that same
afternoon he pours it to the fast-milk, and hands it to the Sacrificer:
thereby he bestows food upon

<span id="page_501">p. 501</span>

the Sacrificer, and thus, indeed, food does not turn away from the
Sacrificer,

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:25">14:3:1:25</span></span>25.
He then sprinkles it (the Pravargya apparatus) with water: water being a
means of appeasement, he thus appeases it; he sprinkles it all over: all
over he thus appeases it; three times he sprinkles, for threefold is the
sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:26">14:3:1:26</span></span>26.
He then says (to the Prastot*ri*), 'Sing the Vârshâhara Sâman!'--the
fallow stallion <span id="fr_1318"></span>[1](#fn_1308.md) (v*ri*shâ
hari*h*) doubtless is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is
that (sun): it is thus him he thereby pleases, and therefore he says,
'Sing the Vârshâhara Sâman <span id="fr_1319"></span>[2](#fn_1309.md)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:27">14:3:1:27</span></span>27.
They then cleanse themselves at the pit. With (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 23),
'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us,' he takes water in his
joined hands; for water is a thunderbolt: he thus makes a covenant with
the thunderbolt;--and with, 'May they be unfriendly unto him who hateth
us, and whom we hate!' let him sprinkle it in whatever direction he who
is hateful to him may be, and he thereby overthrows him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:28">14:3:1:28</span></span>28.
He (the Sacrificer) then steps out towards the north-east, with (Vâ*g*.
S. XXXVIII, 24), 'From out of the gloom have we risen,'--gloom is

<span id="page_502">p. 502</span>

evil: it is gloom, evil, he thus drives away;--'beholding the higher
light,'--this (terrestrial) world is higher than the water: it is on
this world he thus establishes himself;--'God Sûrya, with the gods, the
highest light,'--Sûrya, the highest light, is the heavenly world: it is
in the heavenly world he thus finally establishes himself. He walks
along without looking back, and puts a log of wood on the
Âhavanîya <span id="fr_1320"></span>[1](#fn_1310.md), with (Vâ*g*. S.
XXXVIII, 25), 'A kindler thou art, fire thou art: lay thou fire into
me!' it is a blessing he thereby invokes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:29">14:3:1:29</span></span>29.
And at a continued pressing of Soma they also perform the Gharma of
curds and whey (Dadhi-gharma),--for Soma is the sacrifice, and the
Pravargya is its head: he thus restores to the sacrifice its head,--at
the midday-pressing, for that--to wit, the midday-pressing--is Indra's
special pressing: he thus pleases him in his own share;--when the
Mâdhyandina-pavamâna has been chanted, for the Mâdhyandina-pavamâna is
the breath: it is breath he thereby lays into him;--with the
Agnihotra-ladle, for the Agnihotra is the mouth of sacrifices: he thus
puts a mouth in the head.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:30">14:3:1:30</span></span>30.
On its being brought, he says, 'Hotâr, speak what thou hast to speak!'
for the Hot*ri* speaks on this occasion. Then, stepping up, he says,
'Cooked is the offering-food;' for cooked, indeed, it is. Having stepped
across (behind the Âhavanîya), and called for the *S*rausha*t*, he says,
'Pronounce the offering-formula!' and offers on the Vasha*t* being
uttered. When the Vasha*t* is

<span id="page_503">p. 503</span>

repeated, he brings the draught, and hands it to the Sacrificer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:31">14:3:1:31</span></span>31.
Having solicited an invitation <span id="fr_1321"></span>[1](#fn_1311.md)
(and received an answer from the priests), he drinks of it, with (Vâ*g*.
S. XXXVIII, 27), 'May there be in me that great energy,'--a great
energy, indeed, is he who shines yonder;--'in me the fitness, in me the
intelligence,'--fitness and intelligence he thus secures to
himself;--'the Gharma of triple fires shineth,'--for this Gharma of
triple fires indeed shines;--'together with the shining light,'--for
together with the shining light (the sun) it indeed is;--'together with
the fire, the Brahman,'--for together with the fire, the Brahman, it
indeed is,--(Vâ*g*. S. XXXVIII, 28), 'The seed of the milk hath been
brought,'--for this is indeed the seed of the milk that has been
brought;--'may we obtain the milking thereof year after year!'--it is a
blessing he thereby invokes. They then cleanse themselves at the pit the
significance of this is the same as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:32">14:3:1:32</span></span>32.
Now, then, as to the sacrificial gifts. The gold plate he gives to the
Brahman; for the Brahman is seated, and gold is settled <span
id="fr_1322"></span>[2](#fn_1312.md) glory: therefore he gives the gold
plate to the Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:33">14:3:1:33</span></span>33.
And that cow which yielded the Gharma-milk he gives to the Adhvaryu; for
scorched, as it were, is the Gharma, and the Adhvaryu comes forth (from
the sacrificial ground) like something scorched <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[3](#fn_1313.md): therefore he gives it to the
Adhvaryu.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:34">14:3:1:34</span></span>34.
And that cow which yielded the Sacrificer's

<span id="page_504">p. 504</span>

fast-milk he gives to the Hot*ri*; for the Hot*ri* is the sacrifice, and
the Sacrificer also is the sacrifice: therefore he gives it to the
Hot*ri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:35">14:3:1:35</span></span>35.
And that cow which yielded the fast-milk for the (Sacrificer's) wife he
gives to the chanters, for it is they, the Udgât*ri*s, that do, as it
were, the wife's work on this occasion: therefore he gives it to the
chanters.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:1:36">14:3:1:36</span></span>36.
And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya)
enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as
at the creation <span id="fr_1324"></span>[1](#fn_1314.md).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1292"></span>[493:2](sbe44123.htm#fr_1301.md) That is,
according to whether there are three, six, or twelve Upasad days to the
particular form of Soma-sacrifice about to be performed. On each of
these days there would be two performances of the Upasads,--and in case
the Pravargya is to be performed--as many performances of that
sacrifice.

<span id="fn_1293"></span>[493:3](sbe44123.htm#fr_1302.md) On the day
before the Soma-sacrifice, the two performances of the Pravargya and the
Upasads are combined and gone through in the forenoon, instead of the
forenoon and afternoon as is otherwise the case. Kâty. XXVI, 7, 1 does
not refer to the performance of the Pravargya on this day, but merely
remarks that 'at the end of the Upasads (i.e. of the combination of the
Upasads, comm.) the removal of the Pravargya' takes place. Âpast. XV,
12, 4-6, on the other hand, states distinctly that the total number of
performances of the Pravargya is to be double that of the Upasad days.

<span id="fn_1294"></span>[493:4](sbe44123.htm#fr_1303.md) The 'setting
out' (utsâdana) of the Pravargya is the technical phrase for the removal
and orderly laying out (in the form of a man) of the apparatus used for
the Pravargya ceremony.

<span id="fn_1295"></span>[493:5](sbe44123.htm#fr_1304.md) After collecting
the implements they take them out of the *s*âlâ <span id="page_494">p.
494</span> and lay them down near the Anta*h*pâtya peg, at a few steps
from the front door (whilst Âpast. makes them to be put on the
throne-seat placed north of the Âhavanîya).

<span id="fn_1296"></span>[494:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1305.md) According to the
comm. on Kâty. XXVI, 7, 4, it is the Adhvaryu who--after ladling four
times into the offering-spoon--distributes this ghee successively over
the three bundles of sticks,--viz. pouring some upon the first two
whilst they are held, at the specified height over the Âhavanîya fire,
by the Agnîdh (who immediately after the offering throws them into the
fire), and upon the third after it has been held knee-high by the
Agnîdh, and then thrown into the fire by the Adhvaryu. According to
Âpastamba, who makes the Pratiprasthât*ri* and Adhvaryu the two
performers, the third portion of the ghee is offered on the bundle of
sticks whilst it is still held knee-high over the fire. As noted by
Kâtyâyana, the ceremony is analogous (though reversed as regards the
order of height) to the offering on the three enclosing-stones at the
*S*atarudriya ceremony, IX, 1, 1, 5 seqq.

<span id="fn_1297"></span>[495:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1306.md) Viz. out of the
*s*âlâ, with the Sacrificer's wife in front of him, <span
id="page_496">p. 496</span> and followed by the others. According to
Âpast. XV, 13, 4, the Pratiprasthât*ri* now leads the Sacrificer's wife
within the enclosure; and whilst attendants carry away the objects not
immediately connected with the Pravargya ceremony (post, peg, strings,
sand, &c.), the Adhvaryu places the throne-seat (with the chief vessels)
so as to stand with two feet on the Vedi, and with the other two outside
it, and calls on the Prastot*ri* to sing the Sâman. This (as is usual in
chanting) is done three times--the Adhvaryu, however, repeating his
summons each time--and each time all of them (including the Patnî) sing
or utter a special finale,--the first time in the *s*âlâ, the second
time midway between the *s*âlâ and the Uttaravedi, and the third time
when they have arrived behind the Uttaravedi; the finales corresponding
to the formulas of this paragraph, viz.--'For the protection (or
protector) of heaven (we follow) thee!'--'For the protection of the
Brahman--thee!'--'For the protection of the self--thee!'

<span id="fn_1298"></span>[496:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1307.md) It should be
borne in mind that the Mahâvîra by which they are supposing themselves
to be led now, is looked upon as a symbol of the sun.

<span id="fn_1299"></span>[497:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1309.md) The same Sâman
is sung when they betake themselves to the expiatory bath at the end of
the Soma-sacrifice, cf. IV, 4, 5, 8 where the stobha had better be
altered to 'ahâvo' (though the Sandhi in the text is the same as of
'ahâvas'). As on that former occasion, all the priests, as well as the
Sacrificer, join in the finale.

<span id="fn_1300"></span>[497:2](sbe44123.htm#fr_1310.md) In doing so,
they take the Pravargya-vessels and implements along with them.

<span id="fn_1301"></span>[497:3](sbe44123.htm#fr_1311.md) Hardly 'is
suffering pain,' as it was taken at IX, 2, 1, 29; though
'*s*u*s*u*k*âna' and '*s*u*k*' evidently refer to internal heat, or
passion, cf. [p. 464](sbe44119.htm#page_464.md), note 4 (There is no such
note--JBH), [p. 468](sbe44119.htm#page_468.md), note
[1](sbe44119.htm#fn_1241.md).

<span id="fn_1302"></span>[498:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1312.md) Kâtyâyana only
lays down the rule that, in the case of the sacrifice not being
accompanied with the building of a fire-altar, the Pravargya apparatus
should be removed to the Uttara-vedi; whilst, in the case of one who
likewise performs the Agni*k*ayana, he would doubtless follow the
indication already laid down in the Brâhma*n*a, IX, 2, 1, 19; viz. that
the pot may be removed to an island, but should rather be deposited on
the fire-altar (in which case, however, the 'setting out' of the
apparatus would apparently have to be deferred till after the
performance of the Soma-sacrifice). Âpastamba treats of the Uttara-vedi
as the place where the implements are to be deposited, but finally he
allows an option of other places, including an island, but not the
fire-altar.

<span id="fn_1303"></span>[498:2](sbe44123.htm#fr_1313.md) The words 'sa
na*h* sarvâyu*h* saprathâ*h*,' being here used as explanatory of 'sa no
vi*s*vâyu*h* saprathâ*h*,' have probably got by mistake into the
Sa*m*hitâ.

<span id="fn_1304"></span>[499:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1314.md) The author
evidently understands the text more in accordance with Mahîdhara's
interpretation which makes 'anyavratasya' to refer to the Supreme Spirit
(paramâtmâ) whose law, or ways, are different front men's, and construes
it with 'sa*sk*ima' (we serve, are devoted, to that righteous one). The
preceding part of the half-verse he would thus take independently of
this:--'Away hatred! away guile!'

of bone, skin, and hair.

sand used for them, and brought thither in vessels.

<span id="fn_1307"></span>[500:2](sbe44123.htm#fr_1317.md) That is, the
sand of the 'mound of remains' (u*kkh*ish*t*akhara), see [p.

<span id="fn_1308"></span>[501:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1318.md) Or, bull.--The
Vâ*g*. S. (XXXVIII, 22) here inserts the verse Rig-v. IX, 2, 6, to be
used during the sprinkling,--'The fallow stallion hath whinnied--or, the
fallow bull hath roared--the mighty one, beautiful as Mitra, *the
water-holding vessel* hath shone like unto the sun." The italicised
words, evidently added to suit the Mahâvîra vessel, are wanting in the
*Ri*k.

<span id="fn_1309"></span>[501:2](sbe44123.htm#fr_1319.md) Kâty. XXVI, 7,
36 (doubtless in accordance with another *s*âkhâ) also prescribes here
the Ish*t*âhotrîya Sâman.

<span id="fn_1310"></span>[502:1](sbe44123.htm#fr_1320.md) The Sacrificer's
wife (according to another *s*âkhâ) also silently puts one on the
Gârhapatya fire.

i.e. not standing or moving.
