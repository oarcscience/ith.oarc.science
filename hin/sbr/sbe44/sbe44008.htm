<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:1">11:1:6:1</A></FONT></span>1. Verily, in the beginning this (universe) was water, nothing but a sea of water. The waters desired, 'How can we be reproduced?' They toiled and performed fervid devotions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, when they were becoming heated, a golden egg was produced. The year, indeed, was not then in existence: this golden egg floated about for as long as the space of a year.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:2">11:1:6:2</A></FONT></span>2. In a year's time a man, this Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, was produced therefrom; and hence a woman, a cow, or a mare brings forth within the space of a year; for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati was born in a year. He broke open this golden egg. There was then, indeed, no resting-place: only this golden egg, bearing him, floated about for as long as the space of a year.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:3">11:1:6:3</A></FONT></span>3. At the end of a year he tried to speak. He said 'bh&ucirc;<I>h</I>': this (word) became this earth;--'bhuva<I>h</I>': this became this air;--'sva<I>h</I>': this became yonder sky. Therefore a child tries to</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_13"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 13</FONT></A></p>  
<p>speak at the end of a year, for at the end of a year Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati tried to speak.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:4">11:1:6:4</A></FONT></span>4. When he was first speaking Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati spoke (words) of one syllable and of two syllables; whence a child, when first speaking, speaks (words) of one syllable and of two syllables.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:5">11:1:6:5</A></FONT></span>5. These (three words consist of), five syllables: he made them to be the five seasons, and thus there are these five seasons. At the end of the (first) year, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati rose to stand on these worlds thus produced; whence a child tries to stand up at the end of a year, for at the end of a year Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati stood up.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:6">11:1:6:6</A></FONT></span>6. He was born with a life of a thousand years: even as one might see in the distance the opposite shore, so did he behold the opposite shore (the end) of his own life.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:7">11:1:6:7</A></FONT></span>7. Desirous of offspring, he went on singing praises and toiling. He laid the power of reproduction into his own self. By (the breath of) his mouth he created the gods: the gods were created on entering the sky; and this is the godhead of the gods (deva) that they were created on entering the sky (div). Having created them, there was, as it were, daylight for him; and this also is the godhead of the gods that, after creating them, there was, as it were, daylight (diva) for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:8">11:1:6:8</A></FONT></span>8. And by the downward breathing he created the Asuras: they were created on entering this earth. Having created them there was, as it were, darkness for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:9">11:1:6:9</A></FONT></span>9. He knew, 'Verily, I have created evil for myself since, after creating, there has come to be, as it were, darkness for me.' Even then he smote</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_14"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 14</FONT></A></p>  
<p>them with evil, and owing to this it was that they were overcome; whence people say, 'Not true is that regarding (the fight between) the gods and Asuras which is related partly in the tale and partly in the legend; for it was even then that Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati smote them with evil, and it was owing to this that they were overcome.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:10">11:1:6:10</A></FONT></span>10. Therefore it is with reference to this that the <I>Ri</I>shi has said, 'Not for a single day hast thou fought, nor hast thou any enemy, O Maghavan illusion is what they say concerning thy battles; no foe hast thou fought either to-day or aforetime.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:11">11:1:6:11</A></FONT></span>11. Now what daylight, as it were, there was for him, on creating the gods, of that he made the day; and what darkness, as it were, there was for him, on creating the Asuras, of that he made the night: they are these two, day and night.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:12">11:1:6:12</A></FONT></span>12. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati bethought himself, 'Everything (sarva), indeed, I have obtained by stealth (tsar) who have created these deities:' this became the 'sarvatsara,' for 'sarvatsara,' doubtless, is the same as 'sa<I>m</I>vatsara (year).' And, verily, whosoever thus knows 'sa<I>m</I>vatsara' to be the same as 'sarvatsara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,' is not overcome by any evil which, by magic art, steals upon him (tsar); and whosoever thus knows 'sa<I>m</I>vatsara' to be the same as 'sarvatsara,' overcomes against whomsoever he practises magic art.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:13">11:1:6:13</A></FONT></span>13. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati bethought himself, 'Verily, I have created here a counterpart of myself, to wit, the year;' whence they say, 'Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the year;' for he created it to be a counterpart of himself:</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_15"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>inasmuch as 'sa<I>m</I>vatsara (year),' as well as 'Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati,' consists of four syllables, thereby it (the year) is a counterpart of him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:14">11:1:6:14</A></FONT></span>14. Now, these are the deities who were created out of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati,--Agni, Indra, Soma, and Paramesh<I>th</I>in Pr&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;patya.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:15">11:1:6:15</A></FONT></span>15. They were born with a life of a thousand years: even as one would see in the distance the opposite shore, so did they behold the opposite shore of their own life.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:16">11:1:6:16</A></FONT></span>16. They went on singing praises and toiling. Then Paramesh<I>th</I>in, son of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, saw that sacrifice, the New and Full-moon offerings, and performed these offerings. Having performed them, he desired, 'Would I were everything here!' He became the waters, for the waters are everything here, inasmuch as they abide in the furthest place; for he who digs here on earth finds indeed water; and, in truth, it is from that furthest place, to wit, from yonder sky that he&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> rains, whence the name Paramesh<I>th</I>in (abiding in the furthest, highest place).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:17">11:1:6:17</A></FONT></span>17. Paramesh<I>th</I>in spake unto his father Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, 'I have discovered a sacrifice which fulfils wishes: let me perform this for thee!'--'So be it!' he said. He accordingly performed it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> for him. Having sacrificed, he (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati) desired, 'Would I were everything here!' He became the breath (vital air), for breath is everything here: Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is that breath which blows here (the wind); and whatsoever knows that it is thus he blows is his (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's) eyesight; and whatsoever is endowed</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_16"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>with breath is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. And, verily, whosoever thus knows that eyesight of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati becomes, as it were, manifest,</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:18">11:1:6:18</A></FONT></span>18. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati spake unto his son Indra, 'Let me perform for thee this wish-fulfilling sacrifice which Paramesh<I>th</I>in has just performed for me.'--'So be it!' he said. He accordingly performed it for him. Having sacrificed, he (Indra) desired, 'Would that I were everything here!' He became speech (v&acirc;<I>k</I>), for speech is everything here; whence they say, 'Indra is V&acirc;<I>k</I>.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:19">11:1:6:19</A></FONT></span>19. Indra spake unto his brothers Agni and Soma, 'Let me perform for you this wish-fulfilling sacrifice which our father Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati has just performed for me.'--'So be it!' they said. He accordingly performed it for them. Having sacrificed, those two desired, 'Would that we were everything here!' One of them became the eater of food, and the other became food: Agni became the eater of food, and Soma food; and the eater of food, and food, indeed, are everything here.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:20">11:1:6:20</A></FONT></span>20. These five deities, then, performed that wish-fulfilling sacrifice; and for whatever wish they sacrificed, that wish of theirs was fulfilled; and, verily, for whatever wish one performs that sacrifice, that wish of his is fulfilled.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:21">11:1:6:21</A></FONT></span>21. When they had sacrificed they beheld (discovered) the eastern quarter, and made it the eastern (front) quarter; as it now is that eastern (front) quarter: therefore creatures here move in a forward direction, for they (the gods) made that the front quarter. 'Let us improve it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> from here!'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_17"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>they said, and made it to be strength, 'May we see&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> this strength!' they said; and it became yonder sky&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:22">11:1:6:22</A></FONT></span>22. They then beheld the southern quarter, and made it the southern quarter; and it now is that southern (right, dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;) quarter: whence the dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc; (cows) stand to the south (of the altar)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and are driven up from the south, for they made that the southern one (dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;). 'Let us improve it from here!' they said, and made it to be space. 'May we see this space!' they said; and it became this air, for that (air) is space; for even as the resting-place here in this world is clearly the earth, so the resting-place there in yonder world is clearly this air; and because, whilst being here on earth, one does not see that space, therefore people say, 'That space (or, yonder world) is invisible.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:23">11:1:6:23</A></FONT></span>23. They then beheld the western quarter, and made it (to represent) hope,--wherefore it is only when&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, after going forwards (to the east), one</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A></p>  
<p>obtains (his object) that he goes (back) to that (western) quarter; for they (the gods) made that (quarter to represent) hope. 'Let us improve it from here!' they said, and made it to be prosperity (or distinction). 'May we see this prosperity!' they said; and it became this earth, for this (earth) is indeed (the source of) prosperity; whence he who obtains most therefrom becomes the most prosperous.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:24">11:1:6:24</A></FONT></span>24. They then beheld the northern quarter, and made it the waters. 'Let us improve it from here!' they said, and made it (to represent) the law, for the waters are the law: hence whenever the waters come (down) to this (terrestrial) world everything here comes to be in accordance with the law; but whenever there is drought, then the stronger seizes upon the weaker, for the waters are the law.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:25">11:1:6:25</A></FONT></span>25. These then are eleven deities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,--there are five fore-offerings, two butter-portions, the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t, and three after-offerings:--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:26">11:1:6:26</A></FONT></span>26. These are eleven offerings,--it was, indeed, by these offerings that the gods gained these worlds, and these quarters; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), by these offerings, gain these worlds, and these quarters.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:27">11:1:6:27</A></FONT></span>27. And the four Patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as are the four intermediate quarters; and, indeed, it was by the four Patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as that the gods gained the intermediate quarters; and by means of them this (Sacrificer) now gains the intermediate quarters.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_19"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 19</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:28">11:1:6:28</A></FONT></span>28. And as to the I<I>d</I>&acirc;,--thereby the gods gained food; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby gain food. This, then, is the completeness of the New and Full-moon sacrifices as regards the gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:29">11:1:6:29</A></FONT></span>29. Now as to the body:--there are in man these five breathings, not including the eyes; they are the five fore-offerings, and the two butter-portions are the eyes.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:30">11:1:6:30</A></FONT></span>30. The Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t is the same as this downward breathing; and because he offers that (oblation), as it were, apart from the other oblations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, therefore all the breathings recoil from that breathing; and because for the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t he cuts portions from all the sacrificial dishes, therefore everything that enters these (channels of the other) breathings meets in (the channel of) that breathing.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:31">11:1:6:31</A></FONT></span>31. The three after-offerings are the three male organs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and that which is the chief after-offering is, as it were, the chief organ. 'He should offer it without drawing breath&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>,' they say, 'for thus it becomes unfailing for him.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:32">11:1:6:32</A></FONT></span>32. He may, however, draw breath once, for that (organ) has one joint; but if it were jointless, it</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_20"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>either would only stand erect, or it would hang down; whilst now it both becomes erect and hangs down: he may therefore draw breath once.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:33">11:1:6:33</A></FONT></span>33. The four Patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as are the two arms (or front legs) and the two thighs--the support, in fact&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and the I<I>d</I>&acirc; is this vital air (in the centre); and inasmuch as that (I<I>d</I>&acirc;) is not offered in the fire, but remains as unburnt, therefore this (central) vital air is undivided.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:34">11:1:6:34</A></FONT></span>34. The invitatory and offering-formulas are the bone, and the offering-material is the flesh. The invitatory and offering-formulas are (in) measured metre, whence the bones of a fat and a lean person are alike: but inasmuch as he takes now more, now less, offering-material, therefore the flesh of a fat person is fat, and the flesh of a lean person is lean. This sacrifice he performs to any deity he pleases and for whom there is a sacrificial dish.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:6:35">11:1:6:35</A></FONT></span>35. Now, these are offerings from which nothing must be omitted; but were one to omit anything of them, it would be as if he were to break off some limb, or knock out some (channel of the) vital air. Other oblations, indeed, are either added to or omitted.</p>  
<p>36. These, then, are sixteen offerings, for man consists of sixteen parts, and the sacrifice is the Man (Purusha): hence there are sixteen offerings.</p>
