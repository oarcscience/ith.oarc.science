### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:1">13:4:3:1</span></span>1.
Having set free the horse, he (the Adhvaryu) spreads a cushion wrought
of gold (threads) south of the Vedi: thereon the Hot*ri* seats himself.
On the right (south) of the Hot*ri*, the Sacrificer on a gold
stool <span id="fr_930"></span>[2](#fn_926.md); on the right of him, the
Brahman

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

and Udgât*ri* on cushions wrought of gold; in front of them, with his
face to the west, the Adhvaryu on a gold stool, or a slab of gold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:2">13:4:3:2</span></span>2. When
they are seated together, the Adhvaryu calls upon (the Hot*ri*), saying,
'Hot*ri*, recount the beings: raise thou this Sacrificer above the
beings <span id="fr_931"></span>[1](#fn_927.md)!' Thus called upon, the
Hot*ri*, being about to tell the Pâriplava <span
id="fr_932"></span>[2](#fn_928) Legend, addresses (the Adhvaryu.md),
'Adhvaryu!'--'Havai <span id="fr_933"></span>[3](#fn_929.md) hotar!'
replies the Adhvaryu.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:3">13:4:3:3</span></span>3.
'King Manu Vaivasvata,' he says;--'his people are Men, and they are
staying here <span id="fr_934"></span>[4](#fn_930.md);'--

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

householders, unlearned in the scriptures, have come thither <span
id="fr_935"></span>[1](#fn_931.md): it is these he instructs;--'The *Ri*k
(verses) are the Veda <span id="fr_936"></span>[2](#fn_932.md): this it
is;' thus saying, let him go over a hymn of the *Rik*, as if reciting
it <span id="fr_937"></span>[3](#fn_933.md). Masters of lute-players have
come

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

thither: these he calls upon, 'Masters of lute-players,' he says, 'sing
ye of this Sacrificer along with righteous kings of yore <span
id="fr_938"></span>[1](#fn_934.md)!' and they accordingly sing of him; and
in thus singing of him, they make him share the same world with the
righteous kings of yore.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:4">13:4:3:4</span></span>4.
Having called (on the masters of lute-players), the Adhvaryu performs
the Prakrama oblations <span id="fr_939"></span>[2](#fn_935.md), either on
the southern fire, or on a footprint of the horse, after drawing lines
round it--whichever is the practice there; but the former <span
id="fr_940"></span>[3](#fn_936.md) is the established rule.

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:5">13:4:3:5</span></span>5.
Prior to the (first) offering to Savit*ri* he offers, once only, the
(oblations relating to the) Forms <span id="fr_941"></span>[1](#fn_937.md)
in the Âhavanîya fire, whilst going rapidly over (the formulas). And in
the evening, whilst the Dh*ri*tis <span id="fr_942"></span>[2](#fn_938.md)
(oblations for the safe keeping of the horse) are being offered, a
Râ*g*anya lute-player, striking up the uttaramandrâ (tune) south (of the
vedi), sings three stanzas composed by himself (on topics <span
id="fr_943"></span>[3](#fn_939) such as.md), 'Such war he waged,--Such
battle he won:' the meaning of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:6">13:4:3:6</span></span>6. And
on the morrow, the second day, after those (three) offerings to
Savit*ri* have been performed in the same way, there is that same course

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he (the Hot*ri*) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies
the Adhvaryu.--'King Yama Vaivasvata <span
id="fr_944"></span>[1](#fn_940),' he (the Hot*ri*.md) says, 'his people are
the Fathers, and they are staying here;'--old men have come thither: it
is these he instructs;--'The Ya*g*us-formulas are the Veda: this it is;'
thus saying, let him go over a chapter (anuvâka) of the Ya*g*us <span
id="fr_945"></span>[2](#fn_941.md), as if reciting it. The Adhvaryu calls
in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform
the Prakrama oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:7">13:4:3:7</span></span>7. And
on the third day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in
the same way, there is that same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he
(the Hot*ri*) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King
Varu*n*a Âditya,' he says; 'his people are the Gandharvas, and they are
staying here;'--handsome youths have come thither: it is these he
instructs;--'The Atharvans are the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let
him go over one section (parvan) of the Atharvan <span
id="fr_946"></span>[3](#fn_942.md), as if reciting

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

it. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players),
but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:8">13:4:3:8</span></span>8. And
on the fourth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in
the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he (the
Hot*ri*) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Soma
Vaish*n*ava <span id="fr_947"></span>[1](#fn_943.md),' he says; 'his people
are the Apsaras, and they are staying here;'--handsome maidens have come
thither: it is these he instructs <span
id="fr_948"></span>[2](#fn_944.md);--'The Aṅgiras are the Veda: this it
is;' thus saying, let him go over one section of the Aṅgiras <span
id="fr_949"></span>[3](#fn_945.md), as if reciting it. The Adhvaryu calls
in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform
the Prakrama oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:9">13:4:3:9</span></span>9. And
on the fifth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in
the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he (the
Hot*ri*) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Adhvaryu.--'King
Arbuda Kâdraveya <span id="fr_950"></span>[1](#fn_946.md),' he says; 'his
people are the Snakes, and they are staying here;'--both snakes and
snake-charmers <span id="fr_951"></span>[2](#fn_947.md) have come thither:
it is these he instructs--'The Sarpavidyâ (science of snakes) is the
Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him go over one section of the
Sarpavidyâ <span id="fr_952"></span>[3](#fn_948.md) as if reciting it. The
Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but
does not perform the Prakrama oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:10">13:4:3:10</span></span>10.
And on the sixth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed
in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he
(the Hot*ri*) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Kubera
Vai*s*rava*n*a,' he says; 'his people are the Rakshas, and they are
staying here;'--evil-doers, robbers <span
id="fr_953"></span>[4](#fn_949.md), have come thither: it

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

is these he instructs;--'The Deva*g*anavidyâ <span
id="fr_954"></span>[1](#fn_950) (demonology.md) is the Veda: this it is;'
thus saying, let him go over one section of the Deva*g*anavidyâ, as if
he were reciting it. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters
of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:11">13:4:3:11</span></span>11.
And on the seventh day, after those (three) offerings have been
performed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure.
'Adhvaryu!' he (the Hot*ri*) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the
Adhvaryu.--'King Asita Dhânva <span id="fr_955"></span>[2](#fn_951.md),' he
says; 'his people are the Asura; and they are staying here;'--usurers
have come thither: it is these he instructs;--'Magic <span
id="fr_956"></span>[3](#fn_952.md) is the Veda: this it is;' thus saying,
let him perform some magic trick. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on
the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama
oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:12">13:4:3:12</span></span>12.
And on the eighth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed
in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he
(the Hot*ri*) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Adhvaryu.--'King
Matsya Sâmmada <span id="fr_957"></span>[1](#fn_953.md),' he says; 'his
people are the water-dwellers, and they are staying here;'--both fish
and fishermen <span id="fr_958"></span>[2](#fn_954.md) have come thither:
it is these he instructs;--'the Itihâsa <span
id="fr_959"></span>[3](#fn_955.md) is the Veda: this it is;' thus saying,
let him tell some Itihâsa. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the
masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:13">13:4:3:13</span></span>13.
And on the ninth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed
in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he
(the Hot*ri*) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King
Târkshya Vaipa*s*yata <span id="fr_960"></span>[4](#fn_956.md),' he says;
'his people are the Birds, and they are staying here;'--both birds and
bird-catchers <span id="fr_961"></span>[5](#fn_957.md) have come thither:
it is these he instructs;--'the Purâ*n*a <span
id="fr_962"></span>[3](#fn_955.md) is the Veda: this it is;' thus saying,
let him tell some Purâ*n*a <span id="fr_963"></span>[6](#fn_958.md). The
Adhvaryu calls

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform
the Prakrama oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:14">13:4:3:14</span></span>14.
And on the tenth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed
in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he
(the Hot*ri*) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Dharma
Indra <span id="fr_964"></span>[1](#fn_959.md),' he says, 'his people are
the Gods, and they are staying here;'--learned *s*rotriyas
(theologians), accepting no gifts <span id="fr_965"></span>[2](#fn_960.md),
have come thither: it is these he instructs; 'the Sâman (chant-texts)
are the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him repeat <span
id="fr_966"></span>[3](#fn_961.md) a decade of the Sâman. The Adhvaryu
calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not
perform the Prakrama oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:3:15">13:4:3:15</span></span>15.
\[In telling\] this revolving (legend), he tells all royalties, all
regions, all Vedas, all gods, all beings; and, verily, for whomsoever
the Hot*ri*, knowing this, tells this revolving legend, or whosoever
even knows this, attains to fellowship and communion with these
royalties, gains the sovereign rule and lordship over all people,
secures for himself all the Vedas, and, by gratifying the gods, finally
establishes himself on all beings. This very same legend revolves again
and again for a year; and. inasmuch as it revolves again and again,
therefore

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

it is (called) the revolving (legend). For thirty-six ten-days’ periods
he tells it,--the B*ri*hatî (metre) consists of thirty-six syllables,
and cattle are related to the B*ri*hatî metre: by means of the B*ri*hatî
he thus secures cattle for him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_926"></span>[360:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_930.md) At [XI, 5, 3,
4](sbe44027.htm#11:5:3:4); [7](sbe44027.htm#11:5:3:7.md) 'kûr*k*a' seems to
mean a bunch or pad of grass, used as a seat. In the present instance it
is explained as <span id="page_361">p. 361</span> a seat with feet
(sapâdam âsanam, Schol. on Kâty. XX, 2, 19), or as a seat or stool which
has the appearance of a pad (pî*th*a*m* kûr*k*âk*ri*ti,? i.e. with a pad
on it). According to Â*s*v. *S*r. X, 6, 19) the king is surrounded by
his sons and ministers.

<span id="fn_927"></span>[361:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_931.md) Or, perhaps,
'raise this Sacrificer above (or, up to) the things of the past;' but
see [paragraph 15](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:15.md).

<span id="fn_928"></span>[361:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_932.md) That is, the
'revolving, recurrent, or cyclic legend,' so called because it is
renewed every ten days during the year.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[361:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_933.md) Harisvâmin
explains this interjection, as if it were 'hvayai' = pratihvayai, 'I
will respond, I am ready to respond;' and, though this is probably a
fanciful explanation, the arrangements made on this occasion are clearly
such as to suggest a studied resemblance to the call and counter-call of
the two priests on all occasions of a solemn utterance of sacrificial
formulas, or the recitation of hymns, as at the Prâtaranuvâka (part ii,
p. 226 seqq.). Kâty. XX, 3, 2, accordingly, calls it the Adhvaryu's
'pratigara,' or response. Â*s*v. *S*r. X, 6, 13 makes the Adhvaryu's
answer 'ho hotar'; and Sâṅkh. *S*r. XVI, 1 'hoyi hotar.'

<span id="fn_930"></span>[361:4](sbe44104.htm#fr_934.md) The Hot*ri*'s
utterances on the ten days of the revolving period (as set forth in
passages 2-14) occur also, with some variations of detail, in the
manuals defining the Hot*ri*'s duties, viz. the Â*s*valâyana (X, 7) and
*S*âṅkhâyana (XVI, 2) Sûtras (whilst the works of the Taittirîyakas seem
to have nothing corresponding to this performance). Both Sûtras omit
'râ*g*â' each time. Â*s*valâyana, moreover, omits also the 'iti' along
with it, because he does not interrupt the formula by an insertion, as
is done here (ity âha) <span id="page_362">p. 362</span> and in the
*S*âṅkh. S. (iti prathame, &c.). Gârgya Nârâya*n*a, on Â*s*v. X, 7, 1,
takes the opening words 'prathame (&c.) <sup>ऽ</sup>hani' to form part
of the formulas:--'on the first day Manu Vaivasvata (is king); but it is
clear from the other two authorities that this cannot have been intended
by the author of that Sûtra.--The commentator on *S*âṅkh. S. XVI, 2
remarks, 'Manur Vaivasvato râ*g*ety-evam-âdikam âkhyâna*m*
pariplavâkhya*m* prathamâhany â*k*ash*t*e . . . tasya râ*gñ*o manushyâ
vi*s*a*h* pra*g*âs ta ima âsate<sup>ऽ</sup>dyâpi svadharmân na
*k*alanti,' thus apparently taking 'râ*g*â' to form part of the formula,
or rather of the topic of which the legend to be recited was to treat.
This commentary thus apparently assumes that the legend begins with
'Manur Vaivasvato râ*g*â'; and that the subsequent clause leads on to
the recitation of the Vedic text that is to follow (cf. note on
paragraph 8);--though. possibly this latter clause (as Professor M.
Müller seems to take it) may only be an argumentative one, giving the
reason why the householders are to be instructed. Cf. M. Müller, Hist.
of Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 37 seqq.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[362:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_935.md) 'Householders
should be brought thither' (i.e. should be made to join this
performance); Â*s*v.-sûtra. *S*âṅkh. has merely 'thereby he instructs
householders.' G*ri*hamedhina*h* are those who regularly perform the
five great domestic sacrifices (mahâya*gñ*a).

<span id="fn_932"></span>[362:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_936.md) Or, more closely,
the Veda is the, or consists of, *Rik* (verses). Sâṅkh. S. reads '*rik*o
veda*h*' (the Veda of the *Rik*, gen. sing.) instead of '*rik*a*h*'
(nom. pl.), and in the subsequent paragraph also, it repeats the word
'veda' (Ya*g*urveda, Atharvaveda, Aṅ*g*iraso veda*h*).

<span id="fn_933"></span>[362:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_937.md) That is, as would
seem,--as if he were to recite it (or, as when he recites it) in the
course of the ordinary sacrificial performance--as in *S*astras, the
Prâtaranuvâka, &c. The text would, however, also admit of the
translation--'thus saying, let him go over (the legend) as if he were
reciting a hymn of the *Rik*,' but it is not quite easy to see how a
similar interpretation would suit subsequent paragraphs (11-14).
Moreover, both Â*s*v. and Sâṅkh. omit 'vyâ*k*akshâ*n*a iti,' and read
'nigadet,' 'let him recite (a hymn),' <span id="page_363">p. 363</span>
instead of 'anudravet (let him run, or go, over = anupûrvam u*kk*ârayet,
Harisv.).' Yet, the commentary on *S*âṅkh. supplies the 'iva,'
explaining as he does, 'sûkta*m* ki*mk*id â*k*akshâ*n*a ivânuvadet;'
from which (if it is not simply quoted from our Brâhma*n*a) it would
almost seem as if he, too, thought of the legend rather than a hymn of
the *Rik*. The verb 'vyâ-*k*aksh,' as against 'ni-gad,' seems to imply a
clear articulation--perhaps even with all the stops or pauses, at the
end of every half-verse, or pâda, as the case might be. Sâya*n*a (on
Taitt. Br. II, 2, 1, 4; 2, 6) explains 'vyâ*k*akshîta' by 'vispash*t*am
u*kk*ârayet (or, pa*th*et).' The available MS. of Harisvâmin's
commentary on our text is, as usual, incorrect, but as far as it goes,
it seems to favour the recitation of the legend at this
place,--'vyâ*k*akshâ*n*a iti vâkya*s*as *k*idan (r. *kh*indan) agai*s*
*k*âbhidad (?) ity artha*h*,'--which I take to mean that he is to pause
after each sentence, as he would do when reciting a hymn.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[363:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_938.md) That is, according
to Harisvâmin,--'Compare this Sacrificer in song with the old righteous
kings.' Katy. XX, 3, 8 refers to these latter as 'râ*g*arshis,' or royal
sages--in which case the recitation of the legend itself would only come
in here.

<span id="fn_935"></span>[363:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_939.md) For the formulas
used with this series of forty-nine oblations, see [XIII, 1, 3,
5](sbe44076.htm#13:1:3:5.md) with notes thereon.

<span id="fn_936"></span>[363:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_940.md) That is to say,
according to Harisvâmin, the course of procedure laid down in [XIII, 1,
3, 7](sbe44076.htm#13:1:3:7.md), according to which these oblations are to
be made on the Âhavanîya, and not either on the southern fire, or on a
footprint of the horse.

<span id="fn_937"></span>[364:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_941.md) That is to say,
the Prakramas which are only performed on the first day of the year,
whilst the three oblations to Savit*ri* are repeated each day.

<span id="fn_938"></span>[364:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_942.md) See XIII, 1, 4, 3;
6, 2. These oblations are made just prior to the evening performance of
the Agnihotra, when the Âhavanîya has been got ready for the latter. The
Taittirîyakas seem to make these four oblations on the horse's feet at
the place where the keepers pass the night (viz. the carpenter's house)
during the greater part of the year; and only in the last month, when a
stable of A*s*vattha wood has been put up for the horse near (or on) the
offering-ground, these oblations take place on the Âhavanîya. See comm.
on Taitt. Br. III, 8, 12 (p. 609; cp. p. 700). At III, 9, 14 (p. 703),
on the other hand, it is stated that the Râ*g*anya's singing is to take
place in the evening at the time of the Dh*ri*ti-homas.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[364:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_943.md) Taitt. Br. III, 9,
54, 4, again mentions three topics, one for each stanza--viz. 'thus
(i.e. in the same way as P*ri*thu, Bharata, Bhagîratha, Yudhish*th*ira
&c., comm.) didst thou overpower (the enemies), thus (i.e. surrounded by
heroic warriors, fighting on elephants, steeds, chariots, and on foot,
with bows and arrows, spears, swords, &c.) didst thou battle, thus didst
thou fight such and such battle (i.e. like Yudhish*th*ira, Dushyanta,
&c., having engaged in a battle attended by thousands of great heroes,
thou, armed only with thy sharp sword, didst slay the king of Kashmir,
Magadha, Pu*nd*ra, &c., comm.).'

<span id="fn_940"></span>[365:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_944.md) When the comm. on
*S*âṅkh. S. remarks, 'Yamo Vaivasvato râ*g*ety âheti divitîya evâhani
*S*atapathe dar*s*anât,' this would seem to refer to the addition of
either 'râ*g*â,' or 'ahani,' but not to any legend of Y. V., since such
a one does not occur in this work; though various passages in the *Rik*
might no doubt have sufficed to construct some such legend as would have
served on this occasion.

<span id="fn_941"></span>[365:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_945.md) The same
commentator refers to the 'Â*s*vamedhika' as the section to be
recited,--'prakara*n*ât,' because of the treatment (therein of this
subject).

<span id="fn_942"></span>[365:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_946.md) Instead of
'atharva*n*âm eka*m* parva,' the *S*âṅkh. S. has 'bhesha*g*am
(medicine),' which the commentator--against the opinion of those who
take it to mean the hymn *Ri*g-veda X, 97 (treating of the magic powers
of herbs)--makes a special work of the Âtharva*n*ikas; whilst the Â*s*v.
S. reads 'yad bhesha*g*a*m* ni*s*ânta*m* <span id="page_366">p.
366</span> syât tan nigadet'--'let him tell some approved medicine (i.
e: some specific, or charm against disease).'

<span id="fn_943"></span>[366:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_947.md) The comm. on
Sâṅkh. S. remarks, 'Somo Vaish*n*ava iti *k*aturthe; Somo Vaish*n*avo
râ*g*eti Satapatha*s*rute*h*; pratîkagraha*n*âny etâni.' This seems to
show clearly that he takes this as merely the opening words of the
legend. Here, again, his words can hardly be taken to refer to a legend
regarding Soma in the Satapatha-Brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_944"></span>[366:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_948.md) 'Yuvatî*h*
*s*obhanâ upadi*s*ati, tasyaitâ*h* (? tasyaitâbhya*h*) sabhâyâm anyâsâm
aprave*s*ât,' comm. on *S*âṅkh. S., --? because no other (Apsaras) but
these come to his court.

<span id="fn_945"></span>[366:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_949.md) The *S*âṅkh. S.
has 'let him recite the Ghora'--which the commentator again takes to be
the title of a special work of the Atharvans--whilst the Â*s*v. S. reads
'let him recite some approved ghora (magic spell or operation).'

<span id="fn_946"></span>[367:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_950.md) 'Arbuda*h*
Kâdraveyo râ*g*ety âheti *s*rute*h* (thus also on the name of the next
king),' comm. on *S*âṅkh. S.

<span id="fn_947"></span>[367:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_951) Lit. '(men.md)
knowing about snakes'--which the comm. on Â*s*v. S. explains by 'those
knowing the Kâ*s*yapîya and other treatises (tantra) on venoms.' Instead
of the conjunctive double '*k*a,' the *S*âṅkh. S. has a single 'vâ'--the
snakes, or (rather) snake-charmers--and Â*s*v. S. an explanatory
'iti'--the snakes, i.e. snake-charmers.

<span id="fn_948"></span>[367:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_952.md) The *S*âṅkh. S.
has, 'let hire recite the Sarpavidyâ' (i.e. either the Gâru*d*â or
Kaṅkaniyâ sarpavidyâ, as the comm. explains); the Â*s*v. S. 'let him
recite the Vishavidyâ (science of venoms).'

<span id="fn_949"></span>[367:4](sbe44104.htm#fr_953.md) The etymology and
exact meaning of 'selaga' is doubtful:--here, again, whilst
'pâpak*ri*ta*h*' is added either appositionally, or attributively
(wicked selagas), the *S*âṅkh. S. adds it by means of 'vâ,' and the
Â*s*v. S. by 'iti'--both apparently meant in an explanatory sense. The
Ait. Br., on the other hand, has VII, 1, 'selagâ vâ pâpak*ri*to vâ;' and
VIII, 11, 'nishâdâ vâ selagâ vâ pâpak*ri*to vâ.' The comm. on Â*s*v. S.
explains 'selaga' by 'maddened by a snake;' the comm. on *S*âṅkh. S. by
'selagâ*h* se*n*yâgâyanya*h* (?) pâpak*ri*to vâ mle*kh*â*h*.'

<span id="fn_950"></span>[368:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_954.md) That is, the
science, or knowledge of the divine (or supernatural) beings. The
*S*âṅkh. S. has, 'the Rakshovidyâ is the Veda, . . . let him recite the
Rakshovidyâ'--on which the commentator remarks 'prasiddhaiva kuhukurûpâ
rakshovidyeti.' (? = 'kuhakarûpâ,' cheats, or deceitful imps). Â*s*v. S.
has 'yat ki*mk*it pi*s*â*k*asa*m*yukta*m* ni*s*ântam,' 'some approved
(spell or operation?) connected with the Pi*s*â*k*as, or demons.'

<span id="fn_951"></span>[368:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_955.md) *S*âṅkh. S. has
'Asita Dhânvana.'

<span id="fn_952"></span>[368:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_956.md) The two Sûtras
read 'Asuravidyâ'--asuravidyendra*g*âlâdinâ tannirde*s*ân mâyâm api
kâ*mk*it kuryâd aṅgulinyâsarûpâm ('a trick by sleight of hand,' M.
Müller), comm. on Sâṅkh. S. On 'indra*g*âlavidyâ' ('magic art,
trickery'), cf. Da*s*akum., p. 25, 1. 12. The association of the black
art with the usurer or money-lender (kusîdin) is rather curious.

<span id="fn_953"></span>[369:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_957.md) 'Matsya*h* Sâmmada
ity ash*t*ame, Matsya*h* Sâmmado râ*g*eti *s*rute*h* pratîkagraha*n*am
etat,' comm. on *S*âṅkh. S.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[369:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_958.md) '*G*âtisambandhena
matsyavido vâ, mainikân pâ*th*înâdivi*s*eshavikalpân vidanti ye tan vâ,'
comm. on *S*âṅkh. S.

<span id="fn_955"></span>[369:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_962.md) Regarding the
Itihâsa (cosmogonic account) and Purâ*n*a (ancient legend), see [p.
98](sbe44030.htm#page_98), note [4](sbe44030.htm#fn_317.md). The Â*s*v. S.
connects the Itihâsa with the ninth, and the Purâ*n*a with the eighth
day. 'Itihâsam â*k*akshîta, itihâsavedasya p*ri*thagbhâvena
dar*s*a*n*ât,' comm. on *S*âṅkh. S.

<span id="fn_956"></span>[369:4](sbe44104.htm#fr_960.md) Â*s*v. S. has
Târkshya Vaipa*sk*ita.--'Târkshyo Vaipa*s*yato râ*g*ety âheti
pratîka(*m*) *s*rute*h*,' comm. on *S*âṅkh. S.

<span id="fn_957"></span>[369:5](sbe44104.htm#fr_961.md) Lit., men
acquainted with the science of birds (vâyovidyika). The two Sûtras, on
the other hand, here identify the birds with 'brahma*k*âri*n*a*h*,' or
religious students.

<span id="fn_958"></span>[369:6](sbe44104.htm#fr_963.md) According to the
comm. on *S*âṅkh. S., it is the Vâyupurâ*n*a (purâ*n*a*m* vâyuproktam)
that is to be recited (from), and not the hymn *Ri*g-veda X, 130 ('tasya
vedaikade*s*atvât'). This hymn is probably referred to in this
connection chiefly on account of the passage 'ya*gñ*e *g*âte purâ*n*e'
in verse 6.

<span id="fn_959"></span>[370:1](sbe44104.htm#fr_964.md) 'Dharma Indra iti
da*s*ame, Dharma Indro râ*g*ety âheti *S*atapathe pratikadar*s*anât,'
comm. on *S*âṅkh. S.

<span id="fn_960"></span>[370:2](sbe44104.htm#fr_965.md) The two Sûtras
still further qualify them as 'young *s*rotriyas who accept no gifts,'
'manu(shya)devâ hi ta ity abhiprâyât,' comm. on *S*aab.; cp. *S*at. Br.
II, 2, 2, 6, 'ye brâhma*n*â*h* *s*u*s*ruvâ*m*so<sup>ऽ</sup>nû*k*ânâs te
manushyadevâ*h*.'

<span id="fn_961"></span>[370:3](sbe44104.htm#fr_966.md) The text has
'brûyât,' 'let him say;' whilst the two Sûtras read 'sâma gâyât,' 'let
him sing a Sâman' ('yat ki*mk*id anindyam evâ*s*vâmedhika*m* vâ
prakara*n*ât,' comm. on *S*âṅkh. S.).
