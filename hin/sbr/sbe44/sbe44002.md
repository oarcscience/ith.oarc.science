### INTRODUCTION.

THE present volume completes the theoretic exposition of the sacrificial
ceremonial, and thus brings us to the end of our task. The remaining six
chapters of the last book of the Brâhma*n*a form the so-called
Brihad-âra*n*yaka, or great forest-treatise, which, as one of the ten
primitive Upanishads, is included in Professor F. Max Müller's
translation of those old theosophic treatises, published in the present
series. The portion of the work contained in this volume forms
practically continuation of the first five kâ*nd*as, the intervening
five books being devoted to the consideration of the Agni*k*ayana, or
construction of the sacred brick-altar, which had come to be recognised
as an important preliminary to the Soma-sacrifice. The circumstances
which seem to have led to this somewhat peculiar distribution of the
different sections of the work have been explained in the introduction
to the first volume of the translation. As was there shown, the
inclusion of the Agni*k*ayana in the sacrificial system of the
Vâ*g*asaneyins, or theologians of the White Ya*g*us, appears to have
resulted in a definite settlement of the sacrificial texts of the
ordinary ritual, as contained in the first eighteen adhyâyas of the
Vâ*g*asaneyi-sa*m*hitâ, as well as of the dogmatic explanation of that
ritual as given in the first nine kâ*nd*as of the
*S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a. Considerable portions of the remaining sections
of both works may have been, and very likely were, already in existence
at the time of that settlement, but, being excluded from the regular
ceremonial, they were naturally more liable to subsequent modifications
and additions than

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

those earlier sections which remained in constant use. Whilst the tenth
kâ*nd*a, included in the preceding volume of the translation, consisted
of speculations on the sacred fire-altar, as representing
Purusha-Pra*g*âpati and the divine body of the Sacrificer--whence that
book is called the Agnirahasya, or mystery of the fire-altar--the
present volume contains the supplementary sections connected with the
sacrificial ceremonial proper.

The eleventh and twelfth kâ*nd*as are mainly taken up with additional
remarks and directions on most of the sacrifices treated of in the first
four kâ*nd*as, especially with expiatory ceremonies and oblations in
cases of mishaps or mistakes occurring during the performance, or with
esoteric speculations regarding the significance and mystic effect of
certain rites. In this way the eleventh book deals with the New and
Full-moon sacrifices; the Seasonal offerings ([XI, 5,
2](sbe44026.htm#11:5:2).md), the Agnihotra ([XI, 5,
3](sbe44027.htm#11:5:3); [6, 2](sbe44035.htm#11:6:2).md), the
Soma-sacrifice ([XI, 5, 5](sbe44029.htm#11:5:5.md);
[9](sbe44033.htm#11:5:9).md), and the Animal-sacrifice ([XI, 7,
2](sbe44038.htm#11:7:2)-[8, 4](sbe44044.htm#11:8:4).md); whilst the twelfth
kâ*nd*a treats of the 'Gavâm ayanam'--or most common sacrificial session
lasting for a year, thus offering a convenient subject for dilating upon
the nature of Pra*g*âpati, as the Year, or Father Time;--of additional
expiatory rites for Soma-sacrifices ([XII, 6](sbe44064.htm#12:6:1).md), and
of the Sautrâma*n*î, consisting of oblations of milk and spirituous
liquor, supposed to obviate or remove the unpleasant effects of any
excess in the consumption of Soma-juice ([XII,
7](sbe44065.htm#12:7:1)-[9](sbe44071.htm#12:9:1).md). Though supplementary
notes and speculations on such ceremonial topics cannot but be of a
somewhat desultory and heterogeneous character, they nevertheless offer
welcome opportunities for the introduction of much valuable and
interesting matter. It is here that we find the famous myth of Purûravas
and Urva*s*î ([XI, 5, 1](sbe44025.htm#11:5:1).md); and that of Bh*ri*gu,
the son of Varu*n*a, vividly illustrating the notions prevalent at the
time regarding retribution after death ([XI, 6, 1](sbe44034.htm#11:6:1).md)
as also the important cosmogonic legend of the golden egg from which
Pra*g*âpati is born at the beginning of the evolution of the universe
([XI, 1, 6](sbe44008.htm#11:1:6).md). Of considerable interest also are the
chapters treating of the way in which

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

the dead body of the pious performer of the Agnihotra, or daily
milk-offering, is to be dealt with ([XII, 5,
1](sbe44062.htm#12:5:1)-[2](sbe44063.htm#12:5:2).md); of the initiation and
the duties of the Brâhma*n*ical student ([XI, 3,
3](sbe44055.htm#12:3:3); 5, 4.md); and, last not least, of the study of the
Vedas ([XI, 5, 6](sbe44030.htm#11:5:6)-[7](sbe44031.htm#11:5:7).md) and
their subsidiary texts amongst which we meet, for the first time, with
the Atharvâṅgiras as a special collection of texts recommended for
systematic study.

With the commencement of the thirteenth kâ*nd*a, we enter once more upon
a regular exposition of a series of great sacrifices like those
discussed in the early books; the first and most important of them being
the A*s*vamedha, or Horse-sacrifice. Like the Râ*g*asûya, or
inauguration of a king, the A*s*vamedha is not a mere sacrifice or
series of offerings, but it is rather a great state function in which
the religious and sacrificial element is closely and deftly interwoven
with a varied programme of secular ceremonies. But whilst the Râ*g*asûya
was a state ceremonial to which any petty ruler might fairly think
himself entitled, the A*s*vamedha, on the contrary, involved an
assertion of power and a display of political authority such as only a
monarch of undisputed supremacy could have ventured upon without
courting humiliation <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md); and its
celebration must therefore have been an event of comparatively rare
occurrence. Perhaps, indeed, it is owing to this exceptional character
of the A*s*vamedha rather than to the later origin of its ritual and
dogmatic treatment that this ceremony was separated from the Râ*g*asûya
which one would naturally have expected it to succeed. It is worthy of
remark, in this respect, that, in Kâtyâyana's Anukrama*n*î to the
Vâ*g*asaneyi-sa*m*hitâ, the term 'khila,' or supplement, is not applied
to the A*s*vamedha section <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) (Adhy.
XXII-XXV), while the subsequent sections are distinctly characterised as
such. As a matter of fact, however, the A*s*vamedha has

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

received a very unequal treatment in the different rituals. Of the two
recensions of the Brâhma*n*a of the *Ri*g-veda priests, the
Aitareya-brâhma*n*a takes no account whatever of the Horse-sacrifice,
whilst its last two books (VII, VIII)--generally regarded as a later
supplement, though probably already attached to the work in Pâ*n*ini's
time--are mainly taken up with the discussion of the Râ*g*asûya. The
Kaushîtaki-brâhma*n*a, on the other hand, passes over both ceremonies,
their explanation being only supplied by the *S*âṅkhâyana-sûtra, along
with that of some other sacrifices, in two of its chapters (15 and 16),
composed in Brâhma*n*a style, and said to be extracted from the
Mahâ-Kaushîtaki-brâhma*n*a <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md). In the
principal Brâhma*n*a of the Sâman priests, the
Pa*ñk*avi*ms*a-brâhma*n*a, the A*s*vamedha, as a trirâtra, or triduum,
is dealt with in its proper place (XXI, 4), among the Ahînas, or several
days’ performances. As regards the Black Ya*g*us, both the Kâ*th*aka and
the Maitrâya*n*î Sa*m*hitâ give merely the mantras of the
A*s*vamedha <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md), to which they assign
pretty much the same place in the ritual as is done in the White
Ya*g*us. In the Taittirîya-sa*m*hitâ, on the other hand, the mantras are
scattered piecemeal over the last four kâ*nd*as; whilst, with the
exception of a short introductory vidhi-passage, likewise given in the
Sa*m*hitâ (V, 3, 12), the whole of the exegetic matter connected with
this ceremony is contained, in a continuous form, in the
Taittirîya-brâhma*n*a (VIII and IX). Lastly, in the Vaitâna-sûtra of the
Atharva-veda--doubtless a comparatively late work, though probably older
than the

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Gopatha-brâhma*n*a <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)--the A*s*vamedha is
treated immediately after the Râ*g*asûya, and followed by the
Purushamedha and Sarvamedha; these four ceremonies being characterised
at the end as the Kshatriya's sacrifices <span
id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5) (medha.md).

With regard to the earliest phase of Vedic religion, there is no direct
evidence to show that the horse-sacrifice was already at that time a
recognised institution. Two hymns of the *Ri*g-veda (I, 162; 163), it is
true, relate to that sacrifice <span id="fr_6"></span>[3](#fn_6.md), but
they evidently belong to the latest productions <span
id="fr_7"></span>[4](#fn_7.md) of that collection, though still
sufficiently far removed from the time of the oldest of the ritual works
just referred to. Seeing, however, that animal sacrifices generally are
not alluded to in the *Ri*ksa*m*hitâ <span id="fr_8"></span>[5](#fn_8.md),
whilst there is every reason to believe that they were commonly
practised from remote antiquity, this absence of earlier positive
evidence regarding the horse-sacrifice cannot be taken as proving the
later origin of that institution. As will be seen further on, there are
sufficient indications to show that even human sacrifices were at one
time practised amongst the Aryans of India, as they were amongst their

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> European kinsmen.
The fundamental idea which underlay this practice doubtless was the
notion that man, as the highest attainable living being, could not but
be the most acceptable gift that could be offered to the gods, and, at
the same time, the most appropriate substitute for the human Sacrificer
himself. For the same reason no doubt only domesticated animals were
considered suitable for sacrifice; and amongst these the horse was
naturally looked upon as ranking next to man (*S*at. Br. VI, 2, I, 2),
although considerations of practical expediency and even of social
distinction might prevent its use for ordinary sacrificial purposes.

In the speculations of the Brâhma*n*as, a deep mystic significance is
attached to the Horse-sacrifice. In the last two chapters of the
'Mystery of the Fire-altar' (*S*at. Br, X, 6, 4, I; 4), the
A*s*vamedha--i.e. the sacrificial horse itself--is coupled with the
Arka, the mysterious name of the sacred fire, as the representative of
Agni-Pra*g*âpati, the Sun. The horse-sacrifice is called the bull
([XIII, 1, 2, 2](sbe44075.htm#13:1:2:2).md), and the king ([XIII, 2, 2,
1](sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:1).md), of sacrifices, just as the horse itself is
the highest and most perfect of animals <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9) ([XIII, 3, 3, 1](sbe44096.htm#13:3:3:1.md);
Taitt. Br. III, 8, 7; 8, 9, 1); the horse selected for sacrifice, in
particular, being said to be worth a thousand cows ([XIII, 4, 2,
1](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:1).md). The connection of the sacrificial horse with
'the lord of creatures' is, of course, fully accounted for by the theory
of the identity of the sacrifice generally with Purusha-Pra*g*âpati,
discussed in the introduction to part iv of this translation. The
sacrificial horse accordingly belongs to Pra*g*âpati, or rather is of
Pra*g*âpati's nature (prâ*g*âpatya); nay, as the Taitt. Br. (III, 9, 17,
4) puts it, it is a form of Pra*g*âpati himself (pra*g*âpate rûpam
a*s*va*h*), and is, of all animals, the one most conformable
(anurûpatama*h*) to Pra*g*âpati. Hence also, in the cosmogonic account
at the commencement of the Agni*k*ayana section (VI, 1, 1, 11), the
horse is represented as having originated, immediately after the Brahman
(sacred lore) and Agni, directly from the

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

egg produced by Pra*g*âpati from the cosmic waters; whilst, according to
other accounts (VII, 5, 2, 6; [XIII, 3, 1, 1](sbe44094.htm#13:3:1:1).md),
the horse originated from Pra*g*âpati's eye. But, since the offering
also represents the offerer himself, or rather his divine self awaiting
him in the other world ([XI, 1, 8, 6](sbe44010.htm#11:1:8:6.md); [2, 2,
6](sbe44012.htm#11:2:2:6).md), the sacrificial horse is also identified
with the Sacrificer (ya*g*amâno vâ a*s*va*h*, Taitt. Br. III, 9, 17, 4)
who thereby obtains the fellowship of the Lord of creatures and a place
in his world (ib. III, 9, 20, 2).

Besides Pra*g*âpati, there is, however, another deity who lays claim to
the possession of the sacred steed; for the horse is Varu*n*a's
sacrificial animal (*S*at. Br. V, 3, 1, 5; VI, 2, I, 5; Taitt. Br. III,
9, 16, 1); nay, Varu*n*a is even the lord of all one-hoofed cattle
(Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 30; *S*at. Br. VIII, 4, 3, 13). This connection of the
horse with Varu*n*a seems natural enough, seeing that this god, as the
king of heaven and the upholder of the law, is the divine representative
of the earthly king; whence the Râ*g*asûya, or coronation-ceremony, is
called Varu*n*a's consecration (*S*at. Br. V, 4, 3, 21; cf. II, 2, 3,
1). For this reason the barley also is sacred to Varu*n*a <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10) ([XIII, 3, 8, 5](sbe44101.htm#13:3:8:5).md);
and accordingly, during the same ceremony, the king offers a barley-mash
to Varu*n*a, in the house of his Sûta, or charioteer and herald; a horse
being the sacrificial fee for this offering (V, 3, I, 5). In the Vedic
hymns, this association o1 the god Varu*n*a with the noble quadruped
finds a ready, If rather commonplace, explanation in a common natural
phenomenon: Varu*n*a's horse is none other than the fiery racer who
pursues his diurnal course across the all-encompassing arch of heaven,
the sphere of Varu*n*a <span id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md), the
all-ruler. It is in the

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

form of the horse that the Sun is thus lauded in the hymn Rig-v. I, 163,
recited by the Hot*ri* on the second Soma-day of the A*s*vamedha, after
the horse has been led up to the sacrificial stake, and to the
slaughtering-place <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md):--1. 'When, first
born (just born), thou didst neigh, uprising from the sea, or from the
vapoury region, the falcon's wings and the deer's feet--praiseworthy
greatness was innate in thee, O steed!' . . . 4. 'Three fetterings <span
id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md), they say, are thine in the sky, three in
the waters, three within the sea; and like unto Varu*n*a, O steed, dost
thou appear to me, where, they say, thy highest birth-place is.' And
since, as in these verses, the upper regions commonly present themselves
to the eye of the Vedic singer under the semblance of a heavenly sea,
Varu*n*a also comes to be looked upon as the divine representative of
the waters; whilst the horse, for the same reason, is supposed to have
sprung from the waters. Of any connection of the sacrificial horse with
Pra*g*âpati, on the other hand, as of the Pra*g*âpati theory of the
sacrifice generally, clearly shadowed forth in the Purusha-sûkta, and so
decidedly dominant during the Brâhma*n*a period, no trace is to be found
in the earlier hymns. Indeed, if we have any right to assume that the
horse-sacrifice was known and practised in the earlier times, it can
scarcely be doubted that King Varu*n*a must have been the deity to whom
this victim was chiefly consecrated.

The close and natural relations between the sun and the heavens find
their hallowed expression in the divine duad Mitra and Varu*n*a. Though,
judged by the number of

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

hymns addressed to them, singly or jointly, this pair of deities
occupies a somewhat subordinate position in the Vedic pantheon, there is
reason to believe that it formed a more prominent feature of a phase of
belief lying beyond the period reflected in the hymns of the *Ri*g-veda.
Judging from the peculiar character of these deities, one might indeed
be inclined to claim for the people that formed religious conceptions
such as these a long period of peaceful dwelling and normal intellectual
growth. if such was the case, the occupation of the land of the seven
rivers and the gradual eastward drift certainly proved a turning-point
in the development of this Aryan people. But, in any case, the decided
change of climate <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md), and the close
contact with aboriginal tribes of inferior culture, could hardly fail,
along with the changed conditions of life, to influence considerably the
character of the people, and to modify their religious notions and
intellectual tendencies. As, in their struggles against hostile tribes,
the people would naturally look to leaders of deed and daring rather
than to mild and just rulers, so the violent war of elements,
periodically convulsing the heavens in these regions, after long and
anxious seasons of heat and drought, and striking awe and terror into
the minds of men, might seem to them to call for a heavenly champion of
a different stamp than the even-headed and even-tempered Varu*n*a,--it
would need a divine leader of dauntless, and even ferocious, spirit to
fight the worshipper's battle against his earthly and unearthly foes.
Such a champion the Vedic Aryans indeed created for themselves in the
person of Indra, the divine representative, as it were, of their warlike
kings, and the favourite subject of their song. And side by side with
him, and sharing with him the highest honours--nay, even taking
precedence of him--we find the divine priest, Agni, the deified fire of
sacrifice, as representing the all-pervading, all-supporting

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

light of heaven; just as we found Mitra, the sun, by the side of
Varu*n*a, the god of the all-encompassing heaven. Not as if Agni and
Indra had ever entirely superseded Mitra and Varu*n*a. On the contrary,
all these gods continue to share, in a greater or less degree, the
affections of the Vedic singers; and as regards Varu*n*a and Indra in
particular, their relations are well expressed by Vasish*th*a when he
says (Rig-v. VII, 82, 2; 5), that the one (Varu*n*a) is 'samrâ*g*'
(universal ruler, overlord); and the other (Indra) 'svarâ*g*'
(self-ruler, independent lord);--and that, ever since the time when
these two, by their power, created all the beings in the world, Mitra
serves Varu*n*a in peace, whilst the mighty (Indra) goes forth with the
Maruts in quest of glory. Even in the sacrificial ritual, Mitra and
Varu*n*a continue to play an important part, seeing that one of the
priests--the Maitrâvaru*n*a--is named after them, that they receive
various oblations, and that at the end of every Soma-sacrifice at least
one sterile cow is offered to them, apparently as an expiatory victim,
for shortcomings in the sacrifice <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md),
thus accentuating once more the ethical character of these deities. It
is thus not to be wondered at that, whilst Agni and Indra are most
commonly referred to in the Brâhma*n*as as the divine representatives of
the Brahman and Kshatra, or the spiritual and the political powers-the
high priest and king-respectively, the very same is the case as regards
Mitra and Varu*n*a <span id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md); and the Maruts,
representing the common people, are accordingly associated with
Varu*n*a,

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

as their king or ruler (*S*at. Br. II, 5, 2, 34), just as they are with
Indra (II, 5, 2, 27). One might thus expect that Indra would claim the
same special connection <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) with the
sacrificial horse as that which is conceded to Varu*n*a. The reason why
this is not the case probably is that, in the Brâhma*n*a period, the
notion of the horse having, like the sun, originated from the cosmic
waters had become as firmly established as was the traditional
connection--nay, even identity <span id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md)--of
Varu*n*a with the element of water generally.

As regards Varu*n*a's and Pra*g*âpati's joint connection with the
sacrificial horse, the Taitt. S. (II, 3, 12, 1) records the following
legend which may perhaps have some bearing on this point:--Pra*g*âpatir
Varunâyâ*s*vam anayat, sa svâ*m* devatâm âr*kh*at, sa pary adîryata, sa
eta*m* vâru*n*a*m* *k*atushkapâlam apa*s*yat, ta*m* nir avapat, tato vai
sa varu*n*apâ*s*âd amu*k*yata, Varu*n*o vâ eta*m* g*ri*h*n*âti
yo<sup>ऽ</sup>sva*m* pratig*ri*h*n*âti, yâvato<sup>ऽ</sup>*s*vân
pratig*ri*h*n*îyât tâvato vâru*n*â*ñ* *k*atushkapâlân nir vaped,
Varu*n*am eva svena bhâgadheyenopa dhâvati, sa evaina*m* varu*n*apâ*s*ân
mu*ñk*ati:--'Pra*g*âpati led up the horse to Varu*n*a: he (thereby)
impaired his own godhead, and became racked all over with dropsy. He
beheld that four-kapâla (cake) sacred to Varu*n*a, and offered it, and
thereupon was freed from Varu*n*a's noose; for Varu*n*a seizes him who
takes (receives) a horse,--as many horses as one takes so many
four-kapâla (cakes) one ought to offer to Varu*n*a: one (thereby)
hastens up to Varu*n*a with his (V.'s) own share, and he (V.) frees him
from Varu*n*a's noose.'

The interpretation of this legend presents, however, some difficulties.
Dr. Hillebrandt, Varu*n*a and Mitra' (p. 64), translates the first
sentence by--'Pra*g*âpati führte dem

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Varu*n*a das Ross
fort <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md)'--'Pra*g*âpati led the horse
away froth Varu*n*a': this would undoubtedly make better sense, but,
unfortunately, the construction of 'nî' with the dative in this sense
would involve a decided solecism. Sâya*n*a, on the other hand, takes it
in the same sense as we have done, and he explains that it is just by
giving away the horse whose deity he himself is that Pra*g*âpati
forfeits his godhead <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md). He feels,
however, afterwards constrained to assign to 'pratig*ri*h*n*âti' the
causal force of 'he causes it to be taken, he gives it away,' which is
clearly impossible. But whatever the correct interpretation of the
opening clause may be, it seems at all events-clear that the sacrificial
horse is represented in the legend as undergoing a change of ownership
from the one deity to the other.

When one compares the ceremonial of the A*s*vamedha, as expounded in the
Brâhma*n*a, with the ritual indications contained in the two hymns
already referred to, one is struck by the very marked contrast between
the two. For whilst, on the central day of the A*s*vamedha alone, the
ritual requires the immolation of not less than 349 victims bound to
twenty-one stakes ([p. 311](sbe44087.htm#page_311.md), n.
[1](sbe44087.htm#fn_791).md)--not counting two sets of eleven Savanîya
victims ([p. 383](sbe44106.htm#page_383), n. [3](sbe44106.htm#fn_999).md)
subsequently added thereto--the hymns (I, 162, 2-4; 163, 12) seem only
to mention two victims, viz. the horse itself, and a he-goat. This
latter animal which is to precede the horse when led to the sacrificial
ground (and stake), and to

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

be slaughtered first in order to carry the welcome news of the sacrifice
to the gods, is in one place referred to as Pûshan's share, and in
another as going forward to the dear seat of Indra and Pûshan <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21). *S*âṅkhâyana (*S*rautas. XVI, 3, 27-30.md),
however, takes these statements of the *Ri*shi to refer to two different
he-goats, both of which he includes amongst the victims tied to the
horse's limbs, viz. one, sacred to Pûshan, tied to the forehead, and
another, sacred to Indra and Pûshan, fastened to the navel, of the
horse <span id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_22.md). The corresponding 'paryaṅgya'
victims recognised by the Maitrâya*n*î Sa*m*hitâ (III, 13) and the White
Ya*g*us (Vâ*g*. S. XXIV, 1), on the other hand, are a black-necked
he-goat for Agni, tied to the forehead, and a black or grey (*s*yâma)
one, bound to the navel, and consecrated by the one authority to Pûshan,
and by the other to Soma and Pûshan. But, curiously enough, the
Taittirîya school (Taitt. Br. III, 8, 23; Âp. *S*r. XX, 13, 12)
recognises not only Sâṅkhâyana's two victims, but also the one for Agni;
whilst in regard to the other victims also it differs considerably from
the other schools of the Ya*g*ur-veda. Seeing, then, that there is so
little agreement on these points even amongst different branches of the
same Veda, one can hardly escape the inference that, in this respect at
least, there was no continuity of ritual practice since the time of
those two hymns. As regards the other points therein alluded to, the
he-goat and horse are referred to

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

as being led round thrice in accordance with the sacred ordinance. Now,
this ceremony is quite foreign to the later practice in animal
sacrifices. Sâya*n*a accordingly takes it to refer to the rite of
'paryagnikara*n*a,' or carrying fire round the victims <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md); but the text of the passage evidently
does not admit of such an interpretation; and, besides, in *Ri*g-v. X,
155, 5, the sacrificial cow is apparently referred to as first being led
round, and then fire being carried round it. It is therefore more
probable that the victims were in the first place made to circumambulate
the fire, or the fire and stake combined.

Further, the allusion to the pa*s*u-puro*d*â*s*as, or cakes offered in
connection with the victims, as well as to the two cloths and the piece
of gold placed on the ground, as they are in the later practice, for the
dead horse to lie upon, might seem to suggest that even then this
sacrifice was not performed in quite so simple a manner, but somewhat
more in accordance with the later ceremonial than the scanty allusions
in the hymns might lead one to suppose. At all events, however, we shall
probably not be far wrong in assuming that, from the very beginning, the
performance of the horse-sacrifice must have had connected with it a
certain amount of ceremonial of a purely secular and popular character.
Even at the time of the fully developed ritual this was almost certainly
the case to a larger extent than would appear from the exposition of it
given in the Brâhma*n*as and Sûtras which, indeed, are mainly concerned
with the religious side of the ceremonial. For this reason considerable
interest attaches to the description of the horse-sacrifice given in the
Â*s*vamedhika-parvan of the Mahâbhârata in which much greater stress is
laid on the popular and chivalrous aspect of this religious observance.
Though this epic account manifestly emanates from a much later
period <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md), it seems, upon the whole; to
present the

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

traditional features of this royal ceremony, embellished no doubt by all
the exercise of that poetic fancy to which the occasion so readily lends
itself.

On the completion of the great war between the Pâ*nd*ava and Kaurava
princes, Yudhish*th*ira, having re-ascended the throne of his fathers,
resolves on performing the horse-sacrifice, as calculated to cleanse him
of all guilt <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) incurred by the
slaughter of his Kaurava kinsmen. Having been initiated on the day of
the *K*aitra full-moon (beginning of spring), 'the king, clad in a linen
(? silk) garment and the skin of a black antelope, bearing a staff in
his hand, and wearing a gold wreath, and a round gold plate <span
id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26.md) round his neck, shone like a second
Pra*g*âpati at the holy cult.' The chosen steed <span
id="fr_27"></span>[3](#fn_27.md), of black and white colour like the black
buck, is then led up, and is set free by the sage Vyâ*s*a himself; and
that model of knightly perfection, Ar*g*una, the king's second brother,
is appointed to guard the priceless victim during its year's roaming. He
accordingly starts after it on his chariot yoked with white steeds,
attended by a picked body-guard <span id="fr_28"></span>[4](#fn_28.md),
amidst the rejoicings and fervent blessings of all Hastinâpura--men,
women, and children. Thus followed by its martial escort, the noble
steed roams at will over the lands

<span id="page_xxviii">p. xxviii</span>

over which sovereign sway is claimed by the Pâ*nd*ava king--to wit, the
whole of India from sea to sea--first pressing eastwards towards the
sea, then turning southwards along the eastern shore as far as the
extreme point of the peninsula, and finally northwards again, on its
homeward way, along the western coast. Time after time the determined
attempts to impede its progress, or even to capture and retain it as a
precious trophy and token of national independence, are successfully
repelled by the dauntless son of P*ri*thâ; but, mindful of his brother's
injunctions, he spares the lives of the kings and princes who oppose
him, and, having obtained their submission, he invites them to attend
the sacrifice of the horse at Hastinâpura. On the other hand, not to
take up the challenge implied in the progress of the horse was
considered a sign of weakness or cowardice. Thus the king of Ma*n*ipura
is censured severely by Ar*g*una for receiving him meekly, accompanied
only by Brahmans and with presents to offer to the intruder, being told
that he had lamentably fallen away from the status of a Kshatriya, and
acted the part of a woman. At length tidings of the approach of the
horse reach the king, and forthwith preparations are made for getting
ready the sacrificial ground, and to provide accommodation, on a right
royal scale, for the numerous, guests expected to witness the
ceremonial. Specimens of all available species of animals are brought
together to serve as victims <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md) along
with the sacred horse; and dialecticians,

<span id="page_xxix">p. xxix</span>

eager to vanquish one another, foregather to discuss the nature and
origin of things. At last Ar*g*una arrives, and, having met with an
enthusiastic welcome, he 'takes repose like a seafaring man who has
reached the shore after crossing the ocean.' Then commences the
performance of the sacrifice, the general outline of which, as sketched
in the epic <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md), fairly corresponds to
the ordinary ceremonial; the chief points of difference being the form
and material of the altar, which is described as three-cornered, like
the heavenly bird Garu*d*a, and as being composed of a 'trunk,'
measuring eighteen cubits, and made, like the wings, of gold
bricks,--the structure thus shining like the altar of Daksha
Pra*g*âpati. The sacrifice over, a great public festival ensues for
which 'mountains of food and sweetmeats, rivers of spirituous and other
beverages, and lakes of ghee' are provided, and the feasting goes on
through day and night till every one has had his fill,--a festival,
indeed, of which the poet remarks people continued to talk to his day.

From the fanciful narrative of Ar*g*una's martial exploits whilst
following his precious charge, one could not of course venture to draw
any conclusion as to the kind of adventures the sacred horse might have
met with, at the time of the Brâhma*n*a, during the period of its
roaming at large. As a rule, however, the closely-watched animal would
probably not range very far from the place where the sacrifice was to be
performed; and though its body of guardians were not permitted at any
time to force it to retrace its steps, they could have had little
difficulty in keeping it within a certain range of grazing. Indeed, on
the occasion of King Da*s*aratha's A*s*vamedha <span
id="fr_31"></span>[2](#fn_31.md), described in the first canto of the
Râmâya*n*a, no mention whatever is made of

<span id="page_xxx">p. xxx</span>

anything having happened to the horse during its time of grace. The
expedient mentioned in the Brâhma*n*a ([XIII, 4, 2,
5](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:5).md) that a hundred worn-out horses should be sent
along with the horse to keep it company would doubtless, as a rule,
prove a sufficient check; but seeing that neither the Taitt. Brâhma*n*a
nor *S*âṅkhâyana alludes to this expedient, it is probably meant as a
practical suggestion rather than as a positive injunction. That the
horse intended for sacrifice was by no means always safe from violent
assaults <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md) is clear from the
directions given in the Brâhma*n*as as to what should be done in the
event of foes getting possession of it <span
id="fr_33"></span>[2](#fn_33.md). Even more pointed, in this respect, are
the stanzas quoted in our Brâhma*n*a (XIII, 5, 4, 21. 22),--'Satânîka
Sâtrâ*g*ita seized a sacrificial horse in the neighbourhood, the
sacrifice of the Kâ*s*is, even as Bharata (seized that) of the Satvats.
The mighty Satânîka having seized, in the neighbourhood,
Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra's white sacrificial horse, whilst roaming at will in
its tenth month <span id="fr_34"></span>[3](#fn_34.md), the son of
Satrâ*g*ita performed the Govinata (form of) sacrifice.' As a rule,
however, the fortunes of the roaming horse would doubtless depend
largely on personal circumstances. Whilst a strong ruler who had already
made his power felt amongst his neighbours would probably run little
risk of having his consecrated victim kidnapped even though it were to
stray beyond its master's boundaries, a prince of greater pretensions
than resources might find it very difficult to secure the safety of his
horse even if it kept well within the territory over which he ruled. In
any case, however, the capture of the noble beast would doubtless

<span id="page_xxxi">p. xxxi</span>

cause not a little bad blood, and might lead to complications and
struggles not less serious than those occasioned by Vasish*th*a's cow,
or, in Irish legend, by the brown bull of Queen Medb (Mab) of Connaught.

Whilst the epic account of the A*s*vamedha thus presents an instructive,
though extravagant, illustration of possible occurrences during the
preliminary period of the sacrifice, some items of the ceremonial on
which further information might have been acceptable are altogether
ignored in it. Two of these at least one might have expected to find
mentioned there, seeing that they are of special interest to Kshatriyas,
viz. the practice of a Brâhma*n*a and a Kshatriya lute-player
singing <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md), morning and night, stanzas
composed by themselves in honour of the king; and the so-called
'revolving legend' ([XIII, 4, 3, 1](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:1) seqq..md)
related by the Hot*ri*, in a ten days’ cycle all the year round. It is
especially in regard to this latter point that the statements of the
ritualistic works might with advantage have been supplemented. During
the ten days’ cycle a different god, or some mythic personage, is
assumed, on each successive day, to be king, having some special class
of beings assigned to him as his subjects, and a certain body of texts
as his Veda from which a section is then recited. But from the
particulars given it even remains uncertain whether any legend connected
with the respective deity was actually related; whilst regarding the
form and nature of some of the specified texts--such as the sarpavidyâ
(snake-science), deva*g*anavidyâ (demonology), mâyâ (or asuravidyâ.
magic art)--we really know next to nothing. Nay, even regarding the
Itihâsas and Purâ*n*as, likewise figuring as distinct texts, additional
knowledge would by no means be unwelcome. And though regarding some of
the divinities referred to the Hot*ri* might easily have made up some
kind of short tale, others would have required some

<span id="page_xxxii">p. xxxii</span>

exercise of ingenuity, unless he had at his disposal materials other
than those accessible to us. As a rule, however, legends of this kind
would seem to have been of the simplest possible description, as may be
gathered from the particulars regarding the 'Nârâ*s*a*m*sâni,' or
recitals in praise of (pious) men, which, according to *S*âṅkhâyana
(XVI, 11), take the place of the 'revolving legend' in the ten days’
cycle of the Purushamedha. The Hot*ri*'s recitals on that occasion
consist simply of certain verses, or hymns, of the *Ri*g-veda, generally
celebrating the liberality shown by some patron to his priest, preceded
by a brief statement merely consisting, it would seem, of a prose
paraphrase of the respective verses recited thereafter. This latter set
of recitations and legends thus consists entirely of matter taken from,
or based on, the *Ri*g-veda, which is indeed the proper source for the
Hot*ri* priest to resort to for his utterings. The recitations required
for the A*s*vamedha, on the other hand, consist of matter drawn not even
from the three older Vedas alone, but also from the Atharvans and
Aṅgiras whose names combined usually make up the old designation of the
hymns and spells of the Atharva-veda, whilst they are here taken
separately as if still representing two different collections of
texts;--nay, the materials, as we have seen, are even drawn from other,
probably still later, sources <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md). This
circumstance, added to the fact that the texts of the Black Ya*g*us make
no mention of this item of the ceremonial <span
id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md), might well make one suspect its
comparatively late introduction into the A*s*vamedha ritual; though even
this would not, of course, make it any the less strange that no allusion
should be made, in the epic account, to this by no means the least
interesting feature of the performance. One must, however, bear in mind
that the poet's mind was evidently more intent on telling about the
wonderful deeds

<span id="page_xxxiii">p. xxxiii</span>

of the semi-divine bowman in foreign lands than on recording the
regularly recurring rites performed, in the meantime, at home in the
presence of the royal sacrificer himself. Even in cases where the horse
was kept within a convenient distance from the sacrificial compound all
the year round, its warders, themselves partly of royal blood, could
hardly have had an opportunity of attending the performance of these
rites; though the popular character of some of these rites, as well as
certain expressions used in connection with the 'revolving legend,'
would lead one to suppose that they were meant to be witnessed by at
least representatives of the various classes of the population.

The ritual arrangements of the Purushamedha, or human sacrifice, of
which the Brâhma*n*a treats next, seem to have been developed out of
those of the A*s*vamedha. Its first three Soma-days are essentially the
same as the three days of the horse-sacrifice, except as regards the
difference of victims on the second day. To these the authorities of the
White Ya*g*ur-veda--and apparently also those of the Black Ya*g*us <span
id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md)--add two more days, whilst the
*S*âṅkhâyana-sûtra <span id="fr_39"></span>[2](#fn_39.md), on the other
hand, recognises but one additional day. Like the Vaitâna-sûtra,
*S*âṅkhâyana also differs from the other authorities in giving an
entirely different character to the central feature of this performance,
inasmuch as he makes it a teal human sacrifice instead of a merely
symbolic one. A peculiar interest thus attaches to this difference of
theory, seeing that it involves the question as to how far down the
practice of human sacrifices can be traced in India <span
id="fr_40"></span>[3](#fn_40.md). That such sacrifices were practised

<span id="page_xxxiv">p. xxxiv</span>

in early times is clearly shown by unmistakable traces of them in the
ritualistic works; but in this respect India only shares a once almost
universal custom. The question, then, which chiefly interests us here is
whether or not this practice was still kept up at the time with which we
are here concerned. Now, as regards the texts of the Ya*g*ur-veda--that
is, the text-books of the sacrificial priest κατ᾽ ἐξοχήν--it seems
pretty clear that they no longer recognise the sacrifice of human
beings; and the same may be said of the remaining ritualistic literature
with the exception of the two works above referred to with regard to
this particular sacrifice. The points bearing on this question being
very few in number, may be briefly reviewed here.

First as regards the story of *S*una*hs*epa which is recited at the
Râ*g*asûya sacrifice <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md), and has been
several times treated before <span id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md). King
Hari*sk*andra, being childless, prays to Varu*n*a to grant him a son,
vowing to sacrifice him to the god. A son is born to him, and is called
Rohita; but, in spite of the god's repeated demands, the fulfilment of
the vow is constantly deferred; till at last the youth, having been
invested in armour, is told of the fate awaiting him. He, however,
refuses to be sacrificed, and escapes to the forest. The king thereupon
is seized with dropsy; and the son, hearing of this, hastens homeward to
save his father. On the way he is met by Indra who urges him to wander,
and he accordingly does so for a year. The same is repeated five
different times. In the sixth year, the prince, while wandering in the
forest, comes across a starving Brâhman, A*g*îgarta, who lives there
with his wife and three sons, and who consents to sell him one of his
sons for a hundred cows to serve him as a ransom to Varu*n*a. The
Brâhman wishing to keep his eldest son, whilst the mother refuses to
part with the youngest, the choice falls upon

<span id="page_xxxv">p. xxxv</span>

the second boy, called *S*una*hs*epa. Rohita now returns to his father
who, having been told of the transaction, then proposes to Varu*n*a to
offer the Brâhman youth in lieu of his son; and the god, deeming a
Brâhman better than a Kshatriya, consents to the exchange, and orders
the king to perform the Râ*g*asûya sacrifice, and to make the youth the
chief victim on the Abhishe*k*anîya, or day of consecration. Four
renowned *Ri*shis officiate as offering-priests but when the human
sacrifice is to be consummated, no one will undertake to bind the
victim. The boy's own father, A*g*îgarta, then volunteers to do so for
another hundred cows; and subsequently he even undertakes to slay his
son for a similar reward. But when the poor lad sees his own father
coming towards him, whetting his knife, and becomes aware that he is
really to be slain, 'as if he were not a man,' he bethinks himself of
calling upon the gods for help; and by them he is successively referred
from one to another, till by uttering three verses in praise of Ushas,
the Dawn, he is released from his fetters, whilst the king is freed from
his malady. Subsequently one of the four priests, the royal sage
Vi*s*vâmitra, receives Suna*hs*epa as his son, conferring upon him the
name of Devarâta (Theodotos), and refuses to give him up to A*g*îgarta;
and when the latter calls on his son to return to him, and not to desert
his ancestral race, he replies, 'What has never been found even amongst
*S*ûdras, thou hast been seen with a knife in thy hand, and hast taken
three hundred cows for me, O Aṅgiras!' And on his father avowing his
guilt, and promising to make over the cattle to him, he again replies,
'He who has once done wrong will commit another sin; thou hast not
abandoned the ways of a *S*ûdra: what thou hast done is irremediable';
and 'is irremediable,' echoes Vi*s*vâmitra, who then formally adopts him
as his son.

This legend <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md), so far from bearing
witness to the existence

<span id="page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</span>

of human sacrifices as a generally recognised practice, at the time when
it originated, would rather seem to mark this particular case as an
exceptional one. For, if it were not so, how comes it that the king's
four high-priests--who, if any, must have been looked upon as thorough
masters of the sacrificial science--should have refused to assist in the
immolation of the human victim ordered by the deity, leaving it to be
accomplished by the sullied hands of the wretched father? But there is
another feature of the story which cannot but strike one as very
peculiar. Why should the childless king pray for the birth of a son only
to make a sacrifice of him? He has been told to do so by the holy sage
Nârada: is one then to understand that the sage's advice, as well as
Varu*n*a's consent, is given merely to try the king's faith and
truthfulness? If so, the case is similar to that of Abraham's sacrifice
in the land of Moriah, only that the king's faith proves less intense
and exalted--perhaps more humanly faint-hearted--than that of the Jewish
patriarch. But the most striking feature of the legend doubtless is the
part played in it by the unnatural father; and this feature seems indeed
to impart to the tale something of the character of an allegorical
representation of the contrast between a barbarous (and perhaps earlier)
and a more civilised phase of life and moral feeling <span
id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md). In this respect two points deserve to be
noticed, viz. the coarseness of the synonymous names ('dog's tail') of
the three sons of the Brâhman <span id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md); and
the fact that the latter belongs to the Aṅgiras stock, a name intimately
associated with superstitious

<span id="page_xxxvii">p. xxxvii</span>

rites <span id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md) on the one hand, and with the
ritual of the fire-altar <span id="fr_47"></span>[2](#fn_47.md) on the
other.

Now, it is exactly in connection with the building of the fire-altar
that the clearest, and most unmistakable trace of an old practice of
human sacrifices--or rather of the slaying of men for sacrificial
purposes--occurs. In laying down the bottom layer of the altar, the pan
which had been used by the Sacrificer for carrying about the sacred fire
for a year is built into this layer, with heads of the five recognised
sacrificial animals <span id="fr_48"></span>[3](#fn_48.md)--man, horse, ox,
sheep, and goat--put therein, in order to impart stability to the altar
(*S*at. Br. VII, 5, 2, I seqq.). In a previous passage of the
Brâhma*n*a <span id="fr_49"></span>[4](#fn_49) (I, 2, 3, 6 seq..md),where
the relative value of non-animal offering-materials and the five
sacrificial animals is discussed, it was stated that, whilst the gods
were making use of one after another of these animals, the sacrificial
essence gradually passed from one to the other, thus rendering the
previous one useless for sacrifice, until it finally passed into the
earth whence it entered the rice and barley afterwards used for
sacrificial dishes. The general purport of this passage would seem to be
to indicate a gradual tendency towards substituting the lower for the
higher animals, and ultimately vegetable for animal offerings; though,
as a matter of fact, animals continued of

<span id="page_xxxviii">p. xxxviii</span>

course to be commonly sacrificed in later times. Now as regards the
heads of the five victims, the author subsequently (VI, 2, 1, 37 seqq.)
makes some further remarks which go far to show that his previous
statements referred only to the traditional practice which, however, was
no longer in use in his own day, and had probably not been so for
generations past. He mentions various expedients adopted by some priests
with a view to keeping up at least some semblance of the old
custom,--viz. either by procuring real heads from some source or other,
or by using heads made of gold or clay; but they are summarily dismissed
as profane and fraudulent counterfeits; and the author then remarks
somewhat vaguely and diplomatically that 'one may slay those five
victims as far as one may be able (or inclined) to do so, for
Pra*g*âpati was the first to slaughter them, and *S*yâpar*n*a Sâyakâyana
the last, and in the interval also people used to slaughter them; but at
the present day people slaughter only (one of <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50)) those two, the (he-goat.md) for Pra*g*âpati,
and the one for Vâyu;' after which he proceeds to explain in detail the
practice then in ordinary use. Later on (VII, 5, 2, 1 seqq.), the
Brâhma*n*a expounds in the usual way the formulas used in the
traditional, and theoretically still available procedure, though in the
actual performance perhaps only the formulas relating to the particular
heads <span id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_51.md) used would be muttered.

While Yâ*gñ*avalkya thus, at least in theory, deals rather cautiously
with this feature of the traditional custom, the theologians of the
Black Ya*g*us <span id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_52.md) take up a somewhat
bolder position. Indeed it is evidently against this older school of
ritualists that some of the censure of our Brâhma*n*a is directed. For
though they too allow, as an alternative practice, the use of a complete
set of five heads, they make

<span id="page_xxxix">p. xxxix</span>

no mention of a man being killed for this purpose, but enjoin that a
dead man's head is to be bought for twenty-one beans <span
id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md), which is then to be laid against an
ant-hill with seven holes in order to again supply it with the seven
'vital airs of the head'; whereupon three stanzas relating to Yama are
to be sung round about it to redeem it from the god of death. Besides
the four animals, there is also to be a he-goat sacred to Pra*g*âpati,
the offering of which is to complete the animal sacrifice <span
id="fr_54"></span>[2](#fn_54.md), In this school also <span
id="fr_55"></span>[3](#fn_55.md), the ordinary practice, however, is to
kill only a he-goat for Vâyu Niyutvat, and to use its head for putting
it in the pan placed in the bottom layer of the altar. As regards the
*Ri*g-veda ritual, the Kaushîtaki-brâhma*n*a, as Prof. Weber has pointed
out, leaves a choice between a he-goat for Pra*g*âpati and one for Vâyu;
whilst the *S*âṅkhâyana-sûtra, curiously enough, again adds the
alternative course of using the set of five heads.

The same scholar has drawn attention to another rite in the sacrificial
ceremonial which seems to him to show clear traces of human sacrifice.
At the purificatory bath at the end of the A*s*vamedha, the Sacrificer
is to be purged of any guilt he may have committed against Varu*n*a by
an oblation made to *G*umbaka (Varu*n*a) on the bald head of a man
possessed of certain repulsive features, whilst standing in the water.
To these particulars,--as given in the present work (XIII, 3, 6, 5), the
Taitt. Brâhma*n*a (III, 9, 15), and Kâtyâyana's Sûtra (XX, 8,
16),--*S*âṅkhâyana (XVI, 18)

<span id="page_xl">p. xl</span>

again adds further particulars, viz. that the man is to be a Brâhma*n*a
of the Âtreya family, bought (or hired) for a thousand cows, and that he
is to enter the river till the water flows into his mouth. Now Prof.
Weber is of opinion that this ceremony would be meaningless if the man
were not actually drowned. I fail, however, to see the necessity of this
assumption, seeing that even a purely symbolical interpretation of the
ceremony will give it all the significance of the real act. That the
Ya*g*us texts contain nothing that could make one suspect that the man
was actually drowned is beyond doubt; but even *S*âṅkhâyana's statement
that the water is to flow into his mouth is probably only meant to
suggest the nearness and semblance of death by drowning. Otherwise the
oblation could hardly have been performed in anything like a decent
form. Besides, *S*âṅkhâyana further states that, after the completion of
the oblation, 'they drive him (the man) out, thinking that the guilt of
the village-outcasts is (thereby) driven out <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md).' Here the verb 'ni*h*-sidh' could hardly
have been used if the man was to be driven farther into the water. What
is meant is probably that the man was to be driven out from the water,
and possibly also from the village, to live an anchorite's life in the
forest.

If now we turn our attention to the Purushamedha, or 'human sacrifice'
proper, we find that the Ya*g*us texts, as far as they deal with this
ceremony at all <span id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_57.md), treat it as

<span id="page_xli">p. xli</span>

a purely symbolical performance. A large number of men and women,
apparently intended to represent all classes of the community, are bound
to eleven sacrificial posts, and after the necessary rites, concluding
with the 'paryagnikara*n*a'--or the carrying of fire round the
oblations--have been performed on them, they are one and all set free;
the sacrifice then proceeding with the offering of the set of eleven
animal victims. That the ceremony in this form, with its pedantically
elaborate array of symbolic human victims, cannot possibly lay claim to
any very great antiquity is self-evident; the only question is whether
it has not come to take the place of some other form of human sacrifice.
Now, after the foregoing statement of facts, it would be idle to deny
that the existence, at one time, of a simple form of human sacrifice is
not only quite possible, but is indeed highly probable; and it would be
no more than might be expected, if such a practice should eventually
have revolted the moral sense of the more refined classes of the
community <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md), just as it happened,
little more than a hundred years ago, in the case of the scarcely less
odious practice of the burning of witches in Christian lands.

The practice of human sacrifices seems, however, to receive evidence of
a yet more direct and unmistakable kind than the facts hitherto
mentioned, from the ceremonial of the Purushamedha, as set forth in the
*S*âṅkhâyana and Vaitâna Sûtras. If this evidence has been reserved here
to the last, it is because there seems reason to believe that, in the
form in which it is presented in those works, the sacrifice was never
actually performed, and probably never meant to be performed, but that
we have here to do with a mere theoretical scheme intended to complete
the sacrificial system. The importance of the subject makes it, however,
desirable that we should take a somewhat closer view of the procedure of
the 'human sacrifice,' as laid down in those two Sûtras.

*S*aṅkh. XVI, 10, 1. Pra*g*âpati, having offered the A*s*vamedha, beheld
the Purushamedha: what he had not gained by the A*s*vamedha, all that he
gained by the Purushamedha <span id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59.md); and so
does the sacrificer now, in performing the Purushamedha, gain thereby
all that he had not gained by the A*s*vamedha. 2, 3. The whole of the
A*s*vamedha ceremonial (is here performed); and an addition thereto.
4-8, First oblations to Agni Kama (desire), A. Dât*ri* (the giver), and
A. Pathik*ri*t (the path-maker) . 9. Having bought a Brâhma*n*a or a
Kshatriya for a thousand (cows) and a hundred horses, he sets him free
for a year to do as he pleases in everything except breaches of
chastity. 10. And they guard him accordingly. 11. For a year there are
(daily) oblations to Anumati (approval), Pathyâ Svasti (success on the
way), and Aditi. 12. Those (three daily oblations) to Savit*ri* <span
id="fr_60"></span>[2](#fn_60.md) in the reverse order. 13. By way of
revolving legends (the Hot*ri* recites) Nâra*s*a*m*sâni . . .--XVI, II,
1-33 enumerate the Nâra*s*a*m*sâni <span id="fr_61"></span>[3](#fn_61.md),
together with the respective Vedic passages.--XVI, 12, 1-7. There are
twenty-five stakes, each twenty-five cubits long . . .; and twenty-five
Agnîshomîya victims. 8. Of the (three) A*s*vamedha days the first and
last (are here performed). 9-11. The second (day) is a
pa*ñk*avi*ms*a-stoma one . . . 12. The Man, a Gom*ri*ga, and a hornless
(polled) he-goat--these are the Prâ*g*âpatya <span

elk (*s*arabha), a camel, and a Mâyu Kimpurusha (? shrieking monkey) are
the anustara*n*â*h*. 14-16. And the (other) victims in groups of
twenty-five for the twenty-five seasonal deities . . . 17. Having made
the adorned Man smell (kiss) the chanting-ground, (he addresses him)
with the eleven verses (Rig-v. X, 15, 1-11) without 'om,'--'Up shall
rise (the Fathers worthy of Soma), the lower, the

<span id="page_xliii">p. xliii</span>

higher, and the middle ones.' 18. The Âprî verses are 'Agnir
m*ri*tyu*h*' . . . 20. They then spread a red cloth, woven of ku*s*a
grass, for the Man to lie upon. 21. The Udgât*ri* approaches the
suffocated Man with (the chant of) a Sâman to Yama (the god of
death).--XVI, 13, 1. The Hot*ri* with (the recitation of) the Purusha
Nârâya*n*a (litany). 2. Then the officiating priests--Hot*ri*, Brahman,
Udgât*ri*, Adhvaryu--approach him each with two verses of the hymn (on
Yama and the Fathers) *Ri*g-v. X, 14, 'Revere thou with offering King
Yama Vaivasvata, the gatherer of men, who hath walked over the wide
distances tracing out the path for many.' 3-6. They then heal the
Sacrificer (by reciting hymns X, 137; 161; 163; 186; 59; VII, 35). 7-18.
Ceremonies analogous to those of the A*s*vamedha (cf. [XIII, 5, 2,

Vait. S. XXXVII, 10. The Purushamedha (is performed) like the
A*s*vamedha . . . 12. There are offerings to Agni Kama, Dât*ri*, and
Pathik*ri*t. 13. He causes to be publicly proclaimed, 'Let all that is
subject to the Sacrificer assemble together!' 14. The Sacrificer says,
'To whom shall I give a thousand (cows) and a hundred horses to be the
property of his relatives? Through whom shall I gain my object?' 15. If
a Brâhma*n*a or a Kshatriya comes forward, they say, 'The transaction is
completed.' 16. If no one comes forward, let him conquer his nearest
enemy, and perform the sacrifice with him. 17. To that (chosen man) he
shall give that (price) for his relatives. 18. Let him make it he
publicly known that, if any one's wife were to speak <span

and kill herself, if she be not a Brâhma*n*a woman. 19. When, after
being bathed and adorned, he (the man) is set free, he (the priest)
recites the hymns A.V. XIX, 6; X, 2.-20. For a year (daily) offerings to
Pathyâ Svasti, Aditi, and

<span id="page_xliv">p. xliv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Anumati. 21. At
the end of the year an animal offering to Indra-Pûshan. 22. The third
day is a Mahâvrata. 23. When (the man <span
id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64).md) is bound to the post, he repeats the
three verses, 'Up shall rise' . . .; and when he is unloosened, the
utthâpanî-verses. 24-26. When he is taken to the slaughtering-place (the
priest repeats) the hari*n*î-verses; when he is made to lie down, the
two verses, 'Be thou soft for him, O Earth'; and when he has been
suffocated, (he repeats) the Sahasrabâhu (or Purusha Nârâya*n*a) litany,
and hymns to Yama and Sarasvatî--XXXVIII, 1-9 treat of the subsequent
ceremonies, including the recitation, by the Brahman, of hymns with the
view of healing the Sacrificer.

Now, even a slight consideration of the ritual of the Purushamedha, as
sketched out in these two works, must, I think, convince us that this
form of human sacrifice cannot possibly be recognised--any more than the
one propounded in the *S*atapatha and Taittirîya Brâhma*n*as--as having
formed part of the traditional sacrificial ceremonial; and that, in
fact, it is nothing more than what *S*âṅkhâyana appears to claim for it,
viz. an adaptation, and that a comparatively modern adaptation, of the
existing A*s*vamedha ritual. Indeed, it seems to me by no means unlikely
that the two different schemes of the Purushamedha originated at about
the same time, and that they were intended to fill up a gap in the
sacrificial system which seemed to require for Man, as the chief
sacrificial animal, a more definite and, so to speak, a more dignified
place in the ceremonial than was up to that time accorded to him. The
circumstance that the account of this sacrifice, as given in the
*S*âṅkhâyana-sûtra, presents some of the ordinary features of Brâhma*n*a
diction, and that it is indeed actually assigned by the commentary to
the Mahâ-Kaushîtaka, should not be allowed to weigh with us, since this
is most likely done for the very purpose of securing for this scheme
some sort of authoritative sanction of respectable

<span id="page_xlv">p. xlv</span>

antiquity <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md). For seeing that the older
ritualistic works know nothing of it, it seems sufficiently evident that
this human sacrifice could not possibly have been *rite* performed in
*S*âṅkhâyana's time, since no proper priest--no genuine Adhvaryu and
Udgât*ri*, at all events--could have been found to perform it. And,
indeed, it can scarcely be without significance that the Atharva-sûtra
is the only other work which recognises the ceremony; and that nearly
all the hymns and verses used in connection with the immolation of the
human victim are taken from the Atharvan and the tenth ma*nd*ala of the
*Ri*k. Nay, the very fact that, in both Sûtra works, this sacrifice is
represented as being undertaken, not for the great object of winning
immortal life, but for the healing of the Sacrificer's bodily
infirmities, might seem sufficient to stamp the ceremony as one
partaking more of the nature of the superstitious rites of the Atharvan
priests than of that of the great sacrifices of the traditional *S*rauta
ritual.

If thus we find it impossible to recognise the Purushamedha as a genuine
member of the sacrificial system, this is still more the case as regards
the Sarvamedha, or all-sacrifice, a ten days’ performance which includes
amongst its component parts, not only the Purushamedha, but also the
A*s*vamedha, the Vâ*g*apeya, and the Vi*s*va*g*it with all the Stomas
and P*ri*sh*th*as,--it thus being the very ceremonial performance that
might seem calculated to fitly crown the edifice of the sacrificial
theory. As regards the ritualistic treatment of this sacrifice, the
number of authorities dealing with it shows a further diminution from
that of the Purushamedha. For whilst the *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a agrees
with the *S*âṅkhâyana and Vaitâna Sûtras on the general features of its
ritual--with the exception, of course, of the radical difference as to
the character of the human sacrifice--the Taittirîya-brâhma*n*a, which
gave at least the list of the symbolic victims of the Purushamedha, is
altogether silent on the Sarvamedha; this ceremony being,

<span id="page_xlvi">p. xlvi</span>

however, dealt with in some of the Sûtra works connected with the Black
Ya*g*us.

The concluding chapter of the thirteenth kâ*nd*a contains a valuable and
interesting account of the preparation of the burial-place or sepulchral
mound, and the interment of the charred bones previously preserved, in
an urn or jar, for some indefinite period since the burning of the dead
body. Of especial interest, in this account, is the statement that the
bones, when committed to the grave, are to be arranged in accordance
with their natural position, the spaces between them being then filled
up with bricks in such a way as to present, as in the case of the
fire-altar, a fancied resemblance to the shape of a bird. It is
difficult to see what explanation could be offered for this feature of
the obsequies, except a vague belief in some form of future
resurrection.

The fourteenth kâ*nd*a, up to the beginning of the Brihad-âra*n*yaka, is
entirely taken up with the exposition of the Pravargya, an important,
though optional and subsidiary, ceremony performed on the Upasad-days of
Soma-sacrifices. Whilst the central feature of this sacrificial
performance consists of a ceremony of an apparently simple and
unpretending character, viz. the preparation of a hot draught of milk
and ghee, the Gharma, which the Sacrificer has to take, after oblations
have been made thereof to various deities, the whole rite is treated
with a considerable amount of mystic solemnity calculated to impart to
it an air of unusual significance. A special importance is, however,
attached to the rough clay pot, used for boiling the draught, and
manufactured and baked in the course of the performance itself; it is
called Mahâvîra, i.e. the great man or hero, and Samrâ*g*, or sovereign
lord, and is made the object of fervid adoration as though it were a
veritable deity of well-nigh paramount power.

Although the history of this ceremony is somewhat obscure, the place
assigned to it in the Soma-ritual would lead one to suppose that its
introduction must have taken place at a time when the main procedure of
the Soma-sacrifice had already been definitely settled. This conclusion

<span id="page_xlvii">p. xlvii</span>

is also borne out by the position taken up towards this ceremony by the
authorities of the Black Ya*g*ur-veda. For whilst the Maitrâya*n*îyâ
Sa*m*hitâ gives at least the formulas used for it, the Kâ*th*aka, on the
other hand, takes no notice whatever of it, and the Taittirîya school
only deals with it in its Âra*n*yaka. Nevertheless, this ceremony can
boast of a respectable antiquity, seeing that it is treated of at some
length in the Brâhma*n*as of the *Ri*k--viz. Ait. Br. 1, 18-22; Kaush.
Br. VIII, 3-7; and this circumstance alone might almost seem to justify
the inference that it was in that very school of ritualists that this
item of the sacrificial ceremonial was first elaborated. It is very
doubtful, however, whether such an inference would find any support in
the dogmatic explanation of the ceremony offered by some of the
theologians of the *Ri*g-veda. At the end of the Pravargya section, in a
passage which has a somewhat disconnected appearance, and seems hardly
in consonance with previous dogmatic explanations, the
Aitareya-brâhma*n*a makes the secret import of the ceremony to be that
of a mystic union of the gods resulting in the generation of a new,
divine body for the Sacrificer. This explanation, having been previously
adopted by Haug and Garbe, was recorded without question in a note to
part ii (p. 104) of this translation. Further consideration of this
matter has, however, convinced me that the theory. referred to fails
altogether to account for the origin of the ceremony, as well as for
important points in its performance which find a ready explanation in
the theory applied to it by the present work, as well as by the
Taittirîya-Âra*n*yaka and the Kaushîtaki-brâhma*n*a. For seeing that the
main object of sacrificial performances generally is the reconstruction
of Pra*g*âpati, the personified universe, and (the divine body of) the
Sacrificer, it is difficult to see why, for this latter purpose, a new
and special ceremony should have been thought necessary; and, besides,
the rejected theory, if it is at all to account for the high honour
rendered to the Mahâvîra pot, would almost involve the recognition of a
form of Liṅga-worship which surely would require very much stronger
evidence than the isolated and

<span id="page_xlviii">p. xlviii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (to my mind)
somewhat suspicious passage on which this theory is based.

Now, as regards the rival theory underlying the exposition of the
Pravargya, as given in the *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a, it makes the Mahâvîra
pot a symbol of the sun, whilst the hot milk draught represents the
divine flood of life and light with which the performer of the ceremony
becomes imbued. These symbolic interpretations, whatever we may think of
them otherwise, certainly adapt themselves admirably to the general
sacrificial imagery. As the sun is the head of the universe--or, in
figurative language, the head of Pra*g*âpati, the world-man--so its
earthly, and earthen, counterpart, the Mahâvîra pot, is the head of
Vish*n*u, the sacrificial man, and the Sacrificer; and this ceremony is
thus performed in order to complete the universe and sacrifice, as well
as the divine body of the Sacrificer, by supplying them with their head,
their crowning-piece, so to speak; and to imbue them with the divine
essence of life and light. For this purpose the theory rather
ingeniously avails itself of certain myths vaguely alluded to in the
*Ri*g-veda, according to which (X, 171, 2) Indra cut off the head of
Makha (here identified with Vish*n*u, the sacrifice and the sun-god);
and (I, 116, 12; 117, 22; 119, 9) Dadhya*ñk*, the son of Atharvan, was
fitted by the A*s*vins with a horse's head, and this hippocephalous
creature then communicated to them the Madhu, or sweet thing,--that is,
as would appear, the sweet doctrine of the Soma, the drink of
immortality. This symbolism readily explains some points connected with
the Pravargya ceremony, for which no obvious reason seems otherwise to
suggest itself. For one thing, it accounts for the deep reverence shown
to the Gharma vessel, which, in fact, is no other than the giver of
light and life himself; whilst the optional character of the ceremony
explains itself from the fact that the Soma-cup, of which the Sacrificer
will subsequently partake, might of itself be expected to supply him
with the blessings which he hopes to derive from the Pravargya. And,
finally, it also becomes clear why the Pravargya must not form part of a
man's first performance of a Soma-sacrifice.

<span id="page_xlix">p. xlix</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For the Pravargya,
as we have seen, is performed on the preliminary days of the
Soma-sacrifice, before the pressing of the Soma has taken place; and it
obviously is only after he has actually partaken of the Soma-drink, and
has thereby potentially 'put on immortality,' that he can partake of the
Gharma, and thus become imbued with the celestial light <span
id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66.md). The dogmatical explanation of this
ceremony thus puts, as it were, the finishing touch to that strange
allegory by which the Indian theologians sought to make the sacrificial
ceremonial a practical illustration of that unity of the All which
speculation had been striving to compass since the days when the
emptiness of the Vedic pantheon had dawned upon the thinking mind, and
when critically inclined bards ventured to sing of the national
god <span id="fr_67"></span>[2](#fn_67.md): 'Not for a single day hast thou
fought, nor hast thou any enemy, O Maghavan: illusion is what they say
concerning thy battles; no foe hast thou fought either to-day or
aforetime.'

As regards the optional and somewhat recondite character of the
Pravargya ceremony, it is probably not without significance that the
section dealing therewith is combined with the speculative
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka so as to make up with it the last book of the
Brâhma*n*a; the Âra*n*yaka-kâ*nd*a, or forest section. Such, at least,
is the case in the Mâdhyandina text, where the Pravargya section
occupies the first three adhyâyas of the last (fourteenth) book; whilst
the Kâ*n*va text presents a slight difficulty in this respect. What
passes generally as the seventeenth (and last) kâ*nd*a of that version,
consists of the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka; whilst the sixteenth kâ*nd*a begins
with the section on funeral rites, corresponding to the last

<span id="page_l">p. l</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (eighth) adhyâya
of kâ*nd*a XIII of the Mâdhyandina recension, and is stated <span
id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68.md) to include also the Pravargya section
(Madhy. XIV, 1-3). Now it is a strange fact that the six adhyâyas of the
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka (XIV, 4-9 in the Mâdhyandina text) are counted 3-8 in
the Kâ*n*va text,--a circumstance which manifestly can only be explained
by the Pravargya section being taken to form the first two adhyâyas of
the last book of that version. This, indeed, is probably implied in the
remark added to the description of a MS. of the Kâ*n*va text in the
catalogue of the MSS. of the Sansk*ri*t College, Benares (p. 44),
according to which 'Pravargyakâ*nd*asya patrâ*n*i' are
'bhinnapramâ*n*âksharâ*n*i,'--that is, 'the leaves of the Pravargya
section have a special pagination' (? i.e. they are numbered
independently of the section on funeral rites preceding them).

And now my task is done, and I must take leave of this elaborate
exposition of the sacrificial ordinances of Indian theology. For
well-nigh a score of years the work has 'dragged its slow length along,'
and during that time it has caused me--and, I doubt not, has caused some
of my readers, too--not a few weary hours. In the early stages of the
work, my old teacher, Professor Albrecht Weber, than whom no one is more
deeply versed in the intricacies of the sacrificial ritual, wrote to me:
'You have undertaken a difficult, a most difficult task; and I can only
hope that your courage and patience will not fail you before you are
through with it.' And, indeed, I must confess that many a time I felt as
if I should never be able to get through my task; and but for Professor
Max Müller's timely exhortations and kindly encouragement, the work
might perhaps never have been completed. 'I know,' he once wrote to me,
'you will thank me one day for having pressed you to go on with your
work;' and now I do indeed thank him most sincerely and with all my
heart for the kindness and patience he has shown me these many years.
But, strange to say, now that the work is completed, I feel as if I
could not do without working at it; and certainly, if

<span id="page_li">p. li</span>

a second edition could ever have been required of a work of this kind,
it would have found me ready once more to work my way through the
bewildering maze of rites; and I know only too well that I should have
to correct many a mistake, and could improve many an awkwardly expressed
passage. In conclusion, a word of cordial thanks is due to the staff of
the University Press, whose patience must often have been severely tried
in the course of the printing of this work, and who, by the excellence
of their presswork, and by their careful supervision, have materially
lightened my task, and saved me much tedious and irksome labour.

Indian Literature, p. 107; Max Müller, History of Ancient Sanskrit

<span id="fn_2"></span>[xvi:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_2.md) Besides the two
chapters referred to, nothing more than quotations are known of this
work. Possibly, however, the difference between it and the
Kaushîtaki-brâhma*n*a consisted merely of such supplements which would
thus be very much of the same character as the last two pa*ñk*ikâs of
the Aitareya-brâhma*n*a, except that they never became so generally
recognised.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[xvi:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_3.md) Though this
circumstance seems to favour the supposition of the more recent
ritualistic treatment of the A*s*vamedha, it may not be out of place to
notice that, in the Maitrâya*n*î Sa*m*hitâ, the A*s*vamedha section is
followed by several Brâhma*n*a sections; amongst them that of the
Râ*g*asûya which is not found in the Kâ*th*aka at all. Sat. Br. [XIII,
3, 3, 6](sbe44096.htm#13:3:3:6.md), calls the A*s*vamedha an
'utsannaya*gñ*a'; but it is not quite clear what is meant thereby,
seeing that the same term is applied to the *K*âturmâsyâni, or Seasonal
offerings (II, 5, 2, 48).

<span id="fn_4"></span>[xvii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_4.md) See Professor M.
Bloomfield's paper on 'The Position of the Gopatha-brâhma*n*a in Vedic
Literature,' Journ. Am. Or. Soc., vol. xix.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[xvii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_5.md) Cf. Mahâbh. XIV, 48,
where these four sacrifices are specially recommended by Vyâsa to
Yudhish*th*ira as worthy of being performed by him as King.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[xvii:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_6.md) Possibly also, the
hymn *Ri*g-veda I, 164 (Ath.-v. IX, 9, 10)--on which see P. Deussen,
Allg. Geschichte der Philosophie, I, 1, p. 105 seq.--may have been
placed after the two A*s*vamedha hymns to supply topics for the priests’
colloquy (brahmodya) at the A*s*vamedha. Cf. [XIII, 2, 6,
9](sbe44088.htm#13:2:6:9) seqq.; [5, 2, 11](sbe44107.htm#13:5:2:11.md)
seqq. The fact that the A*s*vamedha is not treated of in the
Aitareya-brâhma*n*a cannot, of course, be taken to prove the later
origin of the hymns referred to, though it might, no doubt, fairly he
used as an argument in favour of assuming that those parts of the
A*s*vamedha ceremonial in which the Hot*ri* takes a prominent part were
probably not introduced till a later time.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[xvii:4](sbe44002.htm#fr_7.md) Haug, Ait. Br. I,
introd., p. 12 seqq., argues against the assumption of a comparatively
late origin of the hymn I, 162; but his argument meets with serious
lexical and other difficulties.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[xvii:5](sbe44002.htm#fr_8.md) We may leave out of
account here one or two vague allusions, such as X, 155, 5 'these have
led around the cow (or hull) and have carried around the fire; with the
gods they have gained for themselves glory: who dares to attack them?'
The question also as to whether the so-called Âprî-hymns, used at the
fore-offerings of the animal sacrifice, were from the very beginning
composed for this purpose, cannot be discussed here.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[xviii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_9.md) 'They (the
Massagetae) worship the sun only of all the gods, and sacrifice horses
to him; and the reason for this custom is that they think it right to
offer the swiftest of all animals to the swiftest of all the gods.'
Herod. I, 216.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[xix:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_10.md) Dr. Hillebrandt,
'Varu*n*a and Mitra,' p. 65, is inclined to refer this connection to
Varu*n*a's character as the god of waters and the rains, as favouring
the crops and fertility generally.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[xix:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_11.md) Whilst it may be a
matter of opinion whether, with Professor Brugmann (Grundr. II, p. 154),
we have to take the original form of this name to be 'vorvanos,' or
whether the 'u' of the Sanskrit word is merely due to the dulling
influence of the preceding r (cf. taru*n*a, dhâru*n*a, karu*n*a), the
etymological identity of 'varu*n*as' and οὐρανός is now probably
questioned by few scholars. The ethical attributes of this mythological
conception seem to <span id="page_xx">p. xx</span> me to find a
sufficiently intelligible explanation without resorting to outside
influence to account for them. Indeed, Dr. Hillebrandt's 'Varu*n*a and
Mitra' gives a fairly complete and satisfactory account of this figure
of the Indian pantheon in all its relations.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[xx:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_12.md) See Sat. Br. [XIII,
5, 1, 17](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:17), [18](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:17.md).

<span id="fn_13"></span>[xx:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_13.md) That is, probably,
three halting-places (? the points of rising, culminating, and setting).
Perhaps also the three statements are merely meant as an emphatic
repetition of one and the same locality--the sky, the sea of waters;
though, possibly, three different strata of the upper region may be
intended. Professor Ludwig, on the other hand, takes 'trî*n*i
bandhanâni' in the sense of 'three fetters,' and Professor Hillebrandt,
l.c., in that of 'three relations (or connections, Beziehungen).'

<span id="fn_14"></span>[xxi:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_14.md) Whilst the climate
of Baluchistan is regulated, as in Europe, by the succession of four
seasons, the climate of the districts east of the Indus, as of India
generally, shows the characteristic threefold division of rainy, cool,
and hot seasons (S. Pottinger, Beloochistan, p. 319 seqq.).

<span id="fn_15"></span>[xxii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_15.md) Taitt. S. VI, 6, 7,
4, explains this offering as symbolically smoothing down the sacrifice
torn up by recited verses and chanted hymns, even as a field, torn up by
the plough, is levelled by a roller ('matya,' taken however by Sây. in
the sense of 'cow-dung'). The Sat. Br. does not allude to the expiatory
character of the offering, but there can be no doubt that it is of an
essentially piacular significance. It need scarcely be mentioned that
the 'avabh*ri*tha,' or lustral bath, at the end of Soma- and other
sacrifices, is distinctly explained (II, 5, 2, 46; IV, 4, 5, 10) as
intended to clear the Sacrificer of all guilt for which he is liable to
Varu*n*a. Cf. Taitt. Br. III, 9, 15, 'At the lustral bath he offers the
last oblation with "To *G*umbaka hail! " for *G*umbaka is Varu*n*a: he
thus finally frees himself from Varu*n*a by offering.'

<span id="fn_16"></span>[xxii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_16.md) See, for instance,
Sat. Br. IV, 1, 4, 2; V, 3, 2, 4; IX, 4, 2, 16; Maitr. S. IV, 5, 8;
Taitt. Br. III, 1, 2, 7 (kshatrasya râ*g*â
Varu*n*o<sup>ऽ</sup>dhirâ*g*a*h*).

<span id="fn_17"></span>[xxiii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_17.md) Since all the gods
are concerned in the A*s*vamedha-whence the horse is called
'vai*s*vadeva'--Indra would of course have a general interest in it.
Indra is also associated with the horse in so far as he is said to have
first mounted it, *Ri*g-veda I, 163, 2, 9. Indra's two bays (harî) of
course belong to a different conception.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[xxiii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_18.md) Âpo vai
Varu*n*a*h*, Maitr. S. IV, 8, 5.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[xxiv:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_19.md) This, no doubt,
might possibly be taken to mean 'Pra*g*âpati led away the horse for
Varu*n*a,' but Dr. Hillebrandt could hardly have meant it in this sense,
since his argument apparently is that the horse (like Varu*n*a himself)
represents the aqueous element, and that thus, by taking to himself the
horse, Pra*g*âpati incurs dropsy. The exact point which interests us
here, viz. the relation between Pra*g*âpati and Varu*n*a as regards the
sacrificial horse, lies outside Dr. Hillebrandt's inquiry.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[xxiv:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_20.md) In Dr.
Hillebrandt's interpretation, it is also not quite easy to see in what
way Pra*g*âpati, by carrying off Varu*n*a's horse, impaired--'griff an,'
attacked, assailed--his own godhead. One might possibly refer 'svâ*m*'
to the horse, but this would make the construction rather harsh. The
verb 'nî' here would seem to refer to the leading up of the sacrificial
horse to the offering-ground, either for being set free for a year's
roaming, or for sacrifice, for both of which acts the verb
'ud-â-nî'--i.e. to lead up the horse from the water where it was
washed--is used (Sat. Br. [XIII, 4, 2, 1](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:1.md); [5, 1,
16](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:16).md).

<span id="fn_21"></span>[xxv:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_21.md) *Ri*g-veda S. I,
162, 2. 'When, held by the mouth (by the bridle)., they lead round the
offering of the (horse) covered with rich trappings, the all-coloured
he-goat goes bleating in front right eastwards to the dear seat of Indra
and Pûshan. 3. This he-goat, fit for all the gods, is led in front of
the swift horse as Pûshan's share; like (?) the welcome cake, Tvash*tri*
promotes it, along with the steed, to great glory. 4. When thrice the
men duly lead around the horse meet for offering along the way to the
gods, then the he-goat walks first, announcing the sacrifice to the
gods. . . . 16. The cloth which they spread (for the horse to lie upon)
and the upper cloth and the gold, the halter, the steed, the
shackle--these they bring up as acceptable to the gods.'--I, 163, 12.
'Forth came the swift steed to the slaughter, musing with reverent mind;
his mate, the he-goat, is led in front; and behind go the wise singers.'

<span id="fn_22"></span>[xxv:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_22.md) According to the
Taittirîyas, this second he-goat is tied to the cord surrounding the
horse's limbs somewhere above the neck of the horse.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[xxvi:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_23.md) See , note
[5](sbe44086.htm#fn_781.md).

<span id="fn_24"></span>[xxvi:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_24.md) It has even been
supposed to be merely a condensed version of a comparatively modern work
ascribed to *G*aimini, the (A*s*vamedha-parvan of the)
*G*aimini-Bhârata.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[xxvii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_25.md) Vyâsa remarks to
Yudhish*th*ira (XIV, 2071), For the A*s*vamedha, O king of kings,
cleanses away all ill-deeds: by performing it thou wilt without doubt
become free from sin.' Cf. Sat. Br. [XIII, 3, 1,
1](sbe44094.htm#13:3:1:1.md), 'Thereby the gods redeem all sin, yea, even
the slaying of a Brahman they thereby redeem; and he who performs the
A*s*vamedha redeems all sin, he redeems even the slaying of a Brahman.'
As a rule, however, greater stress is laid in the Brâhma*n*a on the
efficacy of the ceremonial in ensuring supreme sway to the king, and
security of life and property to his subjects.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[xxvii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_26.md) The 'rukma' is
borne by the Agni*k*it, or builder of a fire-altar, which is required
for the A*s*vamedha; cf. VI, 7, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[xxvii:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_27.md) It is carefully
selected by charioteers and priests, Mahâbh. XIV, 2087.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[xxvii:4](sbe44002.htm#fr_28.md) Whilst, according
to the Brâhma*n*a ([XIII, 4, 2, 5](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:5).md), the body of
'keepers' is to consist of 100 royal princes clad in armour, 100
noblemen armed with swords, 100 sons of heralds and headmen bearing
quivers and arrows, and 100 sons of attendants and charioteers bearing
staves; the epic gives no details, except that it states that 'a
disciple of Yâ*gñ*avalkya, skilled in sacrificial rites, and well-versed
in the Veda, went along with the son of P*ri*thâ to perform the
propitiatory rites,' and that 'many Brâhma*n*as conversant with the
Veda, and many Kshatriyas followed him at the king's behest.'

<span id="fn_29"></span>[xxviii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_29.md) That is, real or
symbolic, only the domesticated animals being offered, whilst the wild
ones are set free after the ceremony of 'paryagnikara*n*a.' Amongst
these animals the poet curiously enough also mentions (XIV, 2542)
'v*ri*ddhast*ri*ya*h*,' which Pratâpa Chandra Ray translates by 'old
women.' This is of course impossible; if it is not a wrong reading, it
has doubtless to be taken in the sense of 'old female (kine),' probably
the (25) barren cows offered at the end of the A*s*vamedha to
Mitra-Varu*n*a, the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*, and B*ri*haspati ([XIII, 5, 4,
25](sbe44109.htm#13:5:4:25).md) being intended. In its enumeration of the
victims, the Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ (V, 6, 21) indeed mentions 'vairâ*g*î
purushî,' taken by the commentator to mean 'two human females
consecrated to Virâ*g*.' If it be for this or a similar purpose that the
'v*ri*ddha-st*ri*ya*h*' were intended, we may refer to Taitt. Br. III,
9, 8, where it is distinctly stated that 'the man' and the wild animals
are to be released as soon as the 'paryagnikara*n*am' has been performed
on them. But no 'man' being mentioned amongst the victims, Sâya*n*a
<span id="page_xxix">p. xxix</span> takes the 'purusham' here to refer
to the 'vairâ*g*î purushî' mentioned in the Sa*m*hitâ. Perhaps, however,
this passage has rather a wider sense, referring to human victims
generally at any sacrifice.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[xxix:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_30.md) Draupadî's
Asva-upasa*m*vesanam is referred to, but no further particulars are
mentioned.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[xxix:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_31.md) The king's object,
in performing the sacrifice, was to obtain the birth of a son. Cf. Sat.
Br. [XIII, 1, 9, 9](sbe44082.htm#13:1:9:9.md), 'for from of old a hero was
born to him who had performed the (A*s*vamedha) sacrifice.'

<span id="fn_32"></span>[xxx:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_32.md) Whilst
cattle-lifting generally, such as formed the object of the invasion of
the land of the Matsyas by the Trigartas (as related in the
Virâ*t*a-parvan), was probably a practice pretty prevalent from ancient
times, the stealing of the sacrificial horse would offer an additional
temptation, from the political point of view, on account of the
exceptional character of the animal as the symbol of its master's claim
to paramountcy.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[xxx:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_33.md) Sat. Br. [XIII, 1,
6, 3](sbe44079.htm#13:1:6:3.md); Taitt. Br. III, 8, 9, 4.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[xxx:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_34.md) One might feel
inclined to take this specification of that month as implying the
existence, at the poet's time, of the practice of confining the horse in
a pen or shed (made of A*s*vattha palings) during the last two months,
mentioned Taitt. Br. III, 8, 12, 2.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[xxxi:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_35.md) See [XIII, I, 5,
1](sbe44078.htm#13:1:5:1) seqq.; [4, 2, 8](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:8.md) seqq.;
Taitt. Br. III, 9, 14. In connection with the revolving legend,' the
conductors of bands of lute-players seem to have sung additional stanzas
in which the royal Sacrificer was associated with pious kings of old;
see [XIII, 4, 3, 3](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:3.md).

<span id="fn_36"></span>[xxxii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_36.md) It is hardly
likely that some of the texts mentioned (deva*g*anavidyâ, sarpavidyâ,
&c.) refer merely to portions of the Vedic texts.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[xxxii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_37.md) The singing of
stanzas in honour of the king, by a Brâhma*n*a and a Kshatriya, with the
accompaniment of lutes, on the other hand, does form part of the
Taittirîya ritual. Taitt. Br. III, 9, 24.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[xxxiii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_38.md) Whilst the three
Sa*m*hitâs contain no section relating to the Purushamedha, the
Taittirîya-brâhma*n*a (III, 4) enumerates the (symbolic) human victims
in much the same way as does the Vâ*g*asaneyi-sa*m*hitâ (see the present
vol. [p. 413](sbe44111.htm#page_413) seqq..md); and the Âpastamba-sûtra
makes the performance similar to what it is in the White Ya*g*us texts.
The Vaitâna-sûtra of the Atharva-veda also makes it a five days’
performance.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[xxxiii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_39.md) Like the chapter
on the A*s*vamedha, that on the Purushamedha is stated to be taken from
the Mahâ-Kaushîtaki-brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[xxxiii:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_40.md) On this question
see especially A. Weber, Zeitsch. d. D. M. G. 18, p. 262 ff., repr. in
Indische Streifen, II, p. 54 ff.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[xxxiv:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_41.md) See part iii, p.
95.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[xxxiv:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_42.md) Cf. Max Müller,
History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 108 ff.; M. Hang,
Aitareya-brâhma*n*a, II, p. 460 ff.; R. Roth, Weber's Ind. Stud. I, 475
ff.; II, 112 ff.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[xxxv:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_43.md) The earliest
reference to the myth or story of Suna*hs*epa is in *Ri*g-veda I, 24,
11-13; V, 2, 7, where he is apparently alluded to as having been
actually <span id="page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</span> rescued from the stake,
or from (three) stakes to which he was bound either for sacrifice, or,
as Roth prefers, for torture.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[xxxvi:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_44.md) In the Sabhâparvan
of the Mahâbhârata (II, 6275 seqq.),, as was first pointed out by
Lassen, K*ri*sh*n*a accuses *G*arâsandha, king of Magadha and *K*edi,
residing at Mathurâ, of having carried off numerous vanquished kings and
princes to his city, and keeping them confined in his mountain
stronghold with a view to afterwards sacrificing them (at his
Râ*g*asûya) to the lord of Umâ (Rudra); adding subsequently (v. 864)
that 'the immolation of men was never seen at any time.'

<span id="fn_45"></span>[xxxvi:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_45.md) His own mime
'A*g*îgarta,' on the other hand, is taken by the St. Petersburg
Dictionary to mean 'one who has nothing to swallow,' and would thus be
merely descriptive of his condition of life.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[xxxvii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_46.md) Viz. in their
connection with the Atharva-veda. In Mahâbh. V, 548-51 Aṅgiras praises
Indra by means of 'Atharvavedamantrai*h*.' Cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p.
237.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[xxxvii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_47.md) Both in making
the fire-pan (ukhâ) and in laying down the bricks of the fire-altar, the
expression 'aṅgirasvat' (as in the case of Aṅgiras) frequently occurs in
the formulas; cf. VI, 1, 2, 28; 3, 1, 38 ff.; 4, 1, 1 ff.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[xxxvii:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_48.md) All that is said
in the Brâhma*n*a regarding the headless bodies of the five victims is
(VI, 2, 1, 7 seqq.) that Pra*g*âpati, having cut off the heads, and put
them on (the altar, i.e. on himself), plunged four of the trunks into
the water, and brought the sacrifice to a completion by (offering) the
he-goat (not a he-goat, as translated), and that he subsequently
gathered up the water and mud (clay) in which those corpses had lain,
and used them for making bricks for the altar. The view that the other
four bodies should likewise he offered is rejected by the author, who
rather seems to suggest that they should be allowed to float away on the
water.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[xxxvii:4](sbe44002.htm#fr_49.md) A very similar
passage occurs in Ait. Br. VI, 8, on which cp. Max Müller, History of
Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 420.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[xxxviii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_50.md) This doubtless
is what is meant (cf. Kâty. XVI, 1, 38); and 'atha' at the beginning of
VI, 2, 2, 6 ought accordingly to have been taken in the rather unusual
sense of 'or' (? 'or rather'), instead of then.' Cf. VI, 2, 2, 15.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[xxxviii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_51.md) According to Âp.
*S*r. XVI, 17, 19-20, however, even if there is only one head (that of
Vâyu's he-goat) all the formulas are to be pronounced over it.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[xxxviii:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_52.md) The Maitr.
Sa*m*hitâ, however, does not seem to refer to this particular point in
its Brâhma*n*a sections.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[xxxix:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_53.md) Or, according to
Âpastamba, for seven beans; the head to be that of a Kshatriya or a
Vai*s*ya killed either by an arrow-shot or by lightning, and apparently
to be severed from the body at the time of purchase (which, as Professor
Weber rightly remarks, is a merely symbolic one). As, however, the
particulars given by Âpastamba are not mentioned in the older works,
they may not unlikely have been introduced by him to meet some of the
objections raised by the Vâ*g*asaneyins to whose views he generally pays
some attention. Otherwise the transaction might seem rather suspicious.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[xxxix:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_54.md) Taitt. S. V, 1,
83, indeed, seems to speak of the other four animals being set free
after fire has been carried round, so that their sacrificial use would
he merely symbolical. Whether in that case only the head of the one
animal would be used, or the man's head along with it, seems doubtful.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[xxxix:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_55.md) Cf. Taitt. S. V,
5.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[xl:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_56.md) The compound
'ni*h*shiddhapâpmâna*h* (apagrâmâ*h*) 'may possibly be meant in the
sense that the evil deeds of the outcasts are driven out (prevented from
troubling the peace of the village); Katy. XX, 8, 17-18, however, states
that when the Sacrificer has stepped out (of the water), evil-doers
enter (to bathe in the water) without having performed any (other)
rites, and that they are then said to be 'purified by the A*s*vamedha.'

<span id="fn_57"></span>[xl:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_57.md) Besides the
description of the ceremony in the present work (XIII, 6, 1-2, 20), only
the Taittirîya-brâhma*n*a (III, 4) seems to refer to it, enumerating
merely the would-be victims who, according to Âpastamba, as quoted by
Sâya*n*a, are eventually set free. Professor Weber's suggestion that
they may possibly at one time have been intended to be all of them
slaughtered can hardly have been meant seriously. One might as well
suppose that, at the A*s*vamedha, all the 'evil-doers' who, according to
Kâtyâyana, are to bathe in the river, were meant to be drowned.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[xli:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_58.md) When the practice
became generally recognised that the Sacrificer (and priests) should eat
a portion of the offered victim, this alone would, as Professor Weber
suggests, have tended to make human sacrifices impracticable.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[xlii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_59.md) The A*s*vamedha
section of the same work begins:--Pra*g*âpati desired, 'May I gain all
my desires, may I attain all attainments.' He beheld this three days’
sacrificial performance, the A*s*vamedha, and took it, and offered with
it; and by offering with it he gained all his desires, and attained all
attainments.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[xlii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_60.md) See [XIII, 4, 2,
6](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:6)-[17](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:17.md).

<span id="fn_63"></span>[xliii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_63.md) That is, as it
would seem, with a view to dissuading her husband from offering himself
as a victim.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[xliv:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_64.md) Dr. Garbe, in his
translation, makes this and the subsequent rules refer (erroneously I
think) to the animal victims of rule 21.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[xlv:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_65.md) On this and other
passages referred to the Mahâ-Kaushîtaka, cp. Professor Aufrecht's
judicious remarks, Ait. Br., p. v.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[xlix:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_66.md) The
Kaushîtaki-brâhma*n*a (VIII, 3), on the other hand, seems to justify the
prohibition on the ground that, prior to the first complete
Soma-sacrifice, the body of the Sacrifice (and Sacrificer) is
incomplete, and therefore not ready to receive its head, in the shape of
the Pravargya. Hence also the same work allows the Pravargya to be
performed at the first Soma-sacrifice of one who is thoroughly versed in
the scriptures, since such a one is himself the body, or self, of the
sacrifice.
