### SEVENTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:7:1">11:5:7:1</span></span>1. Now,
then, the praise of the study (of the scriptures). The study and
teaching (of the Veda) are a source of pleasure to him, he becomes
ready-minded <span id="fr_323"></span>[5](#fn_323), and independent of
others, and day by day he acquires wealth. He sleeps peacefully; he is
the best physician for himself; and (peculiar) to him are restraint of
the senses, delight in the one thing <span
id="fr_324"></span>[6](#fn_324), growth of intelligence, fame, and the
(task of) perfecting the people <span id="fr_325"></span>[7](#fn_325).
The growing

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

intelligence gives rise to four duties attaching to the
Brâhma*n*a--Brâhma*n*ical descent, a befitting deportment, fame, and the
perfecting of the people; and the people that are being perfected guard
the Brâhma*n*a by four duties--by (showing him) respect, and liberality,
(and by granting him) security against oppression, and security against
capital punishment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:7:2">11:5:7:2</span></span>2. And,
truly, whatever may be the toils here between heaven and earth, the
study (of the scriptures) is their last stage, their goal (limit) for
him who, knowing this, studies his lesson: therefore one's (daily)
lesson should be studied.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:7:3">11:5:7:3</span></span>3. And,
verily, whatever portion of the sacred poetry (*kh*andas) he studies for
his lesson with that sacrificial rite <span
id="fr_326"></span>[1](#fn_326), offering is made by him who, knowing
this, studies his lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson should be
studied.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:7:4">11:5:7:4</span></span>4. And,
verily, if he studies his lesson, even though lying on a soft couch,
anointed, adorned and completely satisfied, he is burned (with holy
fire <span id="fr_327"></span>[2](#fn_327)) up to the tips of his nails,
whosoever, knowing this, studies his lesson: therefore one's (daily)
lesson should be studied.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:7:5">11:5:7:5</span></span>5. The
*Ri*k-texts, truly, are honey, the Sâman-texts ghee, and the
Ya*g*us-texts ambrosia; and, indeed, when he studies the dialogue that
(speech and reply) is a mess of milk and a mess of meat.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:7:6">11:5:7:6</span></span>6. And,
indeed, he who, knowing this, studies day by day the *Ri*k-texts for his
lesson, satisfies the gods with honey, and, thus satisfied, they satisfy
him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:7:7">11:5:7:7</span></span>7. And
he who, knowing this, studies day by day the Sâman-texts for his lesson,
satisfies the gods with ghee; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by
every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:7:8">11:5:7:8</span></span>8. And
he who, knowing this, studies day by day the Ya*g*us-texts for his
lesson, satisfies the gods with ambrosia; and, being satisfied, they
satisfy him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:7:9">11:5:7:9</span></span>9. And
he who, knowing this, studies day by day the dialogue, the traditional
myths and legends, for his lesson, satisfies the gods by messes of milk
and meat; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by every object of
desire, by every kind of enjoyment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:7:10">11:5:7:10</span></span>10.
Moving, indeed, are the waters, moving is the sun, moving the moon, and
moving the stars; and, verily, as if these deities did not move and act,
even so will the Brâhma*n*a be on that day on which he does not study
his lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson should be studied. And hence
let him at least pronounce either a *Ri*k-verse or a Ya*g*us-formula, or
a Sâman-verse, or a Gâthâ, or a Kumbyâ <span
id="fr_328"></span>[1](#fn_328), to ensure continuity of the Vrata <span
id="fr_329"></span>[2](#fn_329).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_323"></span>[99:5](sbe44031.htm#fr_323) Or, as Sâya*n*a
takes it to mean, of intent, undistracted mind,--yuktam avikshiptam
ekâgra*m* mano yasya sa yuktamanâ*h*.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[99:6](sbe44031.htm#fr_324) Sâya*n*a seems to
take 'ekârâmatâ' in the sense of 'remaining always the same,'--eka eva
sann â samantâd bhavatîty ekârâmas tasya bhâva*h*.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[99:7](sbe44031.htm#fr_325) Or, perfecting the
world,--tadyukto yo lokas tasya pakti*h* paripâko bhavati, Sây.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[100:1](sbe44031.htm#fr_326) The study of the
Veda being 'the sacrifice of the Brahman,' the reading of a portion is,
as it were, a special rite, or form of offering, belonging to that
sacrifice. Sâya*n*a, on the other hand, takes it to mean that the
student performs, as it were, the particular rite, or offering, to which
the portion he reads may refer. It may, indeed, be implied, though it
certainly is not expressed in the text.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[100:2](sbe44031.htm#fr_327) Thus A. Weber,
Ind. Stud. X, p. 122;--*s*arîrapî*d*anena tapastapto bhavati, Sây.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[101:1](sbe44031.htm#fr_328) A 'Kumbyâ,'
according to Sâya*n*a, is a Brâhma*n*a-passage explanatory of some
sacrificial precept or rite (vidhyarthavâdâtmaka*m* brâhma*n*a-vâkyam);
whilst, on Aitareyâr. II, 3, 6, 8, the same commentator explains it as a
verse (*ri*g-vi*s*esha) conveying some precept of conduct
(â*k*âra*s*ikshârûpa), such as 'brahma*k*âryasyâpo*s*âna*m* karma kuru,
divâ mâ svâpsî*h*,' &c. Cf. Prof. F. Max Müller's transl., Upanishads I,
p. 230, note 2.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[101:2](sbe44031.htm#fr_329) This is in keeping
with the mystic representation of this and <span id="page_102">p.
102</span> the preceding chapters which represent the daily study of the
scriptural lesson as a sacrifice continued day by day. The student, as
the sacrificer, has accordingly, during the sacrifice (that is, during
the period of his study of the Vedas, or for life), as it were, to limit
his daily food to the drinking of the Vrata-milk, which rule he obeys
symbolically by reciting such a verse or formula.
