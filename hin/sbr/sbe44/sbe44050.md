### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:1">12:2:2:1</span></span>1.
Here, now, they say, 'Whereby are the Abhiplavas possessed of light
(*g*yotis) on both sides <span id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_445.md),

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

and the P*ri*sh*th*ya of light on one side only?' Well, the Abhiplavas
are these worlds, and these worlds are indeed possessed of light on both
sides--through the fire on this side, and through the sun on yonder
side; and the P*ri*sh*th*ya is the seasons, and the seasons are indeed
possessed, of light on one side only: he who burns yonder (the sun) is
their light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:2">12:2:2:2</span></span>2.
Verily, those two wheels of the gods, established on the
P*ri*sh*th*ya <span id="fr_446"></span>[1](#fn_446.md), revolve
crushing <span id="fr_447"></span>[2](#fn_447.md) the Sacrificer's evil;
and, indeed, if during a sacrificial session any one speaks evil of such
initiates as know this, those two wheels of the gods cut off his head:
the (chariot-) seat is the Da*s*arâtra, and the two wheels are the
P*ri*sh*th*ya and Abhiplava.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:3">12:2:2:3</span></span>3.
Concerning this they say, 'Seeing that the two wheels (of a cart) are
alike, and those stomas unlike, how are those stomas one after another
performed alike for him?' Let him reply, 'Thereby, that there are six of
the one, and six of the other.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:4">12:2:2:4</span></span>4. 'Let
him make the P*ri*sh*th*ya and Abhiplava two warps <span
id="fr_448"></span>[3](#fn_448.md),' said Paiṅgya; 'let him make their

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Stotras and
*S*astras run together:' inasmuch as he makes them run together, these
(channels of the) vital airs, though separate from one another, run
together, with one and the same aim <span
id="fr_449"></span>[1](#fn_449.md), into a common web; but were he not to
make them run together, the Sacrificer would be liable to perish; and
liable to perish, indeed, is one who is either blind or deaf.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:5">12:2:2:5</span></span>5. The
Agnish*t*omas amount to nine in a month <span
id="fr_450"></span>[2](#fn_450.md);--now, there are nine vital airs: it is
the vital airs he thus lays into them (the Sacrificers); and thus they
attain the full term of life, and so, indeed, they do not depart this
world before the (full) term of life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:6">12:2:2:6</span></span>6. And
the Ukthyas (amount) to twenty-one;--now, there are twelve months in the
year, five seasons, and three worlds, that makes twenty, and he who
burns yonder (the sun) is the twenty-first <span
id="fr_451"></span>[3](#fn_451.md),

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --that
consummation (he attains), and by that consummation he ascends month by
month to the world of heaven, and gains, in monthly portions, the world
of heaven, and the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and the B*ri*hatî metre <span
id="fr_452"></span>[1](#fn_452.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:7">12:2:2:7</span></span>7. The
Agnish*t*omas amount to thirty-four in a month <span
id="fr_453"></span>[2](#fn_453.md)--for the obtainment of all the gods; for
there are thirty-three gods, and Pra*g*âpati is the thirty-fourth. And
there is one Ukthya with the Sho*d*a*s*in (stotra); for the Ukthya means
food, and the Sho*d*a*s*in vital strength.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:8">12:2:2:8</span></span>8. By
means of that food and vital strength the gods obtained all their
desires, and secured all their desires; and in like manner does this
(Sacrificer); by means of that food and vital strength, obtain all his
desires, and secure all his desires: with a view to that object he who
is initiated for (a sacrificial session of) a year should therefore
perform the P*ri*sh*th*ya and Abhiplava (-sha*d*ahas).

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:9">12:2:2:9</span></span>9. Now,
the Âdityas and the Aṅgiras, both of them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, were
contending together saying, 'We shall be the first to reach heaven,--we
shall be the first!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:10">12:2:2:10</span></span>10.
By means of four Stomas, four P*ri*sh*th*as <span
id="fr_454"></span>[1](#fn_454), and light (simple.md) hymn-tunes, the
Âdityas sailed across to the heavenly world; and inasmuch as they sailed
(abhi-plu) to it, they (these six-days’ periods) are called Abhiplava.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:11">12:2:2:11</span></span>11.
By means of all the Stomas, all the P*ri*sh*th*as <span
id="fr_455"></span>[2](#fn_455), and heavy (complicated.md) hymn-tunes, the
Aṅgiras, coming after (the gods), as it were <span
id="fr_456"></span>[3](#fn_456), touched (reached.md) the heavenly world;
and inasmuch as they touched (sp*ris*) it, it (this six-days’ period) is
called P*ri*sh*th*ya <span id="fr_457"></span>[4](#fn_457.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:12">12:2:2:12</span></span>12.
It is a six-days’ Abhiplava, because it consists of six days; or a
five-days’ Abhiplava, because it consists of five days, for the last day
is the same as the first; or a four-days’ Abhiplava, for there are four
Stomas (used) in it--the thrice-threefold (triv*ri*t), the
fifteen-versed, the seventeen-versed, and the twenty-one-versed one; or
a three-days’ Abhiplava, for it is of three orders--*G*yotis, Go, and

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Âyus <span
id="fr_458"></span>[1](#fn_458.md); or a two-days’ Abhiplava, for there are
two Sâmans (used) in it--the B*ri*hat and the Rathantara <span
id="fr_459"></span>[2](#fn_459.md); or a one-day's Abhiplava, for it is
performed with the Stomas of a one-day's (Soma-sacrifice <span
id="fr_460"></span>[3](#fn_460).md). Twelve Stotras and twelve *S*astras of
the four Ukthyas are in excess <span
id="fr_461"></span>[4](#fn_461.md)--they make a seventh Agnish*t*oma, and
thus the Agnish*t*omas amount to seven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:13">12:2:2:13</span></span>13.
Now, Proti Kau*s*âmbeya <span id="fr_462"></span>[5](#fn_462.md)
Kausurubindi dwelt with Uddâlaka Âru*n*i as a religious student. The
teacher asked him, 'My son, how many days did thy father <span
id="fr_463"></span>[6](#fn_463.md) consider that there are in the year?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:14">12:2:2:14</span></span>14.
'Ten,' he replied.--'Ten, indeed,' he said; 'for the Virâ*g* consists of
ten syllables, and the sacrifice is of Virâ*g* nature;--

15\. But how many are there really?'--'Nine,' he replied.--'Nine,
indeed,' he said; 'for there are nine vital airs, and by means of the
vital airs the sacrifice is performed;--

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:16">12:2:2:16</span></span>16.
But how many are there really?'--'Eight,' he replied.--'Eight, indeed,'
he said; 'for the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and the sacrifice
is of Gâyatrî nature;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:17">12:2:2:17</span></span>17.
But how many are there really?'--'Seven,' he replied.--'Seven, indeed,'
he said; 'for there are seven metres (successively) increasing by four
(syllables), and by means of the metres the sacrifice is performed;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:18">12:2:2:18</span></span>18.
But how many are there really?'--'Six,' he replied.--'Six, indeed,' he
said; 'six seasons make up a year, and the sacrifice is the year; and
one and the same day are those two, the opening and concluding
(Atirâtra <span id="fr_464"></span>[1](#fn_464).md);--

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:19">12:2:2:19</span></span>19.
But how many are there really?'--'Five,' he replied.--'Five, indeed,' he
said; 'the sacrifice is fivefold; the sacrificial animal is
fivefold <span id="fr_465"></span>[2](#fn_465.md); there are five seasons
in the year, and the sacrifice is the year;

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

and one and the same day are those two, the *K*aturvi*ms*a and the
Mahâvrata.;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:20">12:2:2:20</span></span>20.
But how many are there really?'--'Four,' he replied.--'Four, indeed,' he
said; 'animals are four-footed, and animals constitute a sacrifice; and
one and the same day are those two, the P*ri*sh*th*ya and Abhiplava;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:21">12:2:2:21</span></span>21.
But how many are there really?'--'Three,' he replied.--'Three, indeed,'
he said; 'there are three metres, three worlds; and the (Soma-)
sacrifice consists of three services; and one and the same day are those
two, the Abhi*g*it and Vi*s*va*g*it;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:22">12:2:2:22</span></span>22.
But how many are there really?'--'Two,' he replied.--'Two, indeed,' he
said; 'for man is two-footed, and the sacrifice is man; and one and the
same day are the Svarasâmans;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:2:2:23">12:2:2:23</span></span>23.
But how many are there really?'--'One,' he replied.--'A day, indeed,' he
said; 'the whole year is just that day after day:'--this is the mystic
import of the year; and, verily, whosoever thus knows this mystic
import <span id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_466.md) of the year grows more (and
more) glorious up to (the end of) it; he becomes possessed of a (new)
body, he becomes the year, and in the shape of the year he joins the
gods.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_445"></span>[148:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_445.md) The difference
between the Abhiplava-sha*d*aha and the P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha was thus
explained in part iii, introd., p. xxi, note 2:--'In both kinds of
sha*d*aha, the P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras (at the Mâdhyandina-savana) are
performed in the ordinary way--viz. either in the Agnish*t*oma or the
Ukthya way (see ib., p. xvi, note 2, as the correct reference is);--but
whilst, in the Abhiplava-sha*d*aha, the Rathantara and B*ri*hat-sâmans
are used for the Hot*ri*'s P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra on alternate days, the
P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha requires a different P*ri*sh*th*a-sâman on each
of the six days. The two kinds of sha*d*ahas also differ entirely in
regard to the sequence of Stomas prescribed for the performance of the
Stotras.' It is this difference in the 'sequence of Stomas' which is
referred to in our passage. On the six days of the Abhiplava-sha*d*aha,
the sequence of Stomas (the first four of which, viz. Triv*ri*t,
Pa*ñk*ada*s*a, Saptada*s*a, and Ekavi*ms*a, are only used) varies from
day to day in this way: 1. *G*yotish*t*oma; 2. Gosh*t*oma; 3.
Âyush*t*oma; 4. Gosh*t*oma; 5. Âyush*t*oma; 6. *G*yotish*t*oma (for the
difference between these, see part iv, p. 287, note 2). It will thus be
seen that the Abhiplava has the '*g*yotih (stoma)' on both sides, on the
first and the last days. For the Hot*ri*'s P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra on these
successive days the Rathantara-sâman and B*ri*hat-sâman are used; and,
as the Gosh*t*oma and Âyush*t*oma are Ukthya-days, the usual practice
which requires the B*ri*hat-sâman for such days, is not followed; just
as the final *G*yotish*t*oma in this case requires the
B*ri*hat-sâman.--As regards the P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha, each successive
day requires for its stotras a single Stoma, in the ascending order:
Triv*ri*t, Pa*ñk*ada*s*a, Saptada*s*a, Ekavi*ms*a, Tri*n*ava,
Trayastri*ms*a;--a different P*ri*sh*th*a-sâman being used for the
Hot*ri*'s P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra <span id="page_149">p. 149</span> on each
of the six days. Here only the first day has the same Stoma at the
beginning, as the *G*yotish*t*oma,--whence it has '*g*yotis' on one side
only.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[149:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_446.md) This
'p*ri*sh*th*yapratish*th*ite' looks rather strange,--perhaps the correct
reading is 'p*ri*sh*th*apratish*th*ite,' 'established on the
p*ri*sh*th*a-sâmans'; unless, indeed, 'pratish*th*ita' has to be
understood here to refer to the Abhiplava, as the established, or
ordinary, Sha*d*aha, which doubtless would make the best sense,--'those
two wheels of the gods, the P*ri*sh*th*ya and the established
(Abhiplava-) sha*d*aha.'

<span id="fn_447"></span>[149:2](sbe44050.htm#fr_447.md) Or, as we would
rather say, whilst revolving, crush the Sacrificer's evil.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[149:3](sbe44050.htm#fr_448.md) ? Or, possibly,
two kinds of threads, those of the warp and the woof (or weft), which
are combined into one web. The St. Petersb. <span id="page_150">p.
150</span> Dict., on the other hand, takes 'tantra' here in the sense of
'model form, type,'--and, indeed, the one meaning constantly passes into
the other. The MS. of the comm. is too corrupt to be of much use.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[150:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_449.md) This is a doubtful
rendering of 'ekoti.' Though, doubtless, the juxtaposition of 'ekoti'
and 'samânam ûtim' cannot be accidental, the word 'ûti' may probably
have a different derivation and meaning in the two occurrences. Cf.
Kern, Saddharmapu*nd*arîka, introd., p. xvii; Journ. of the Pâli Text
Society, 1885, pp. 32-38.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[150:2](sbe44050.htm#fr_450.md) During five
complete months of the first half, and four complete months of the
second half, of the year four Abhiplava-sha*d*ahas and one
P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha are performed. Now, the six clays of the
Abhiplava-sha*d*aha consist of 1. Agnish*t*oma; 2-5. Ukthyas; 6.
Agnish*t*oma; and those of the P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha of 1.
Agnish*t*oma; 2. 3. Ukthya; 4. Sho*d*a*s*in; 5.6. Ukthya. For the four
Abhiplavas and the one P*ri*sh*th*ya of each month this, accordingly,
gives nine Agnish*t*omas, twenty Ukthyas, and one Sho*d*a*s*in (counted,
however, as an Ukthya in [paragraphs 6](sbe44050.htm#12:2:2:6.md) and
[7](sbe44050.htm#12:2:2:7).md).

<span id="fn_451"></span>[150:3](sbe44050.htm#fr_451.md) The reason why the
Sun is so often referred to as the twenty-first or twenty-one-fold, is
not easy to discover. Possibly it may be from the fact that the Vishuvat
day, or central day of the great session and the longest day of the
year, is identified with the Sun, <span id="page_151">p. 151</span> and
that this day is flanked on both sides by ten special days which
together with the central day, form a special group of twenty-one days.
But, on the other hand, it may be exactly the other way, viz. that this
central group was made one of twenty-one nays because of the already
recognised epithet of Âditya as the 'ekavi*ms*a.' Cf. A. Hillebrandt,
Die Sonnwendfeste in Alt-Indien, p. 6 seq.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[151:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_452.md) Here the
twenty-one Ukthyas are symbolically identified with the
twenty-one-versed hymn-form; and the nine Agnish*t*omas (of [paragraph
5](sbe44050.htm#12:2:2:5).md) with the B*ri*hatî metre which consists of
four pâdas of nine syllables each.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[151:2](sbe44050.htm#fr_453.md) This number is
evidently arrived at by counting the twenty Ukthyas as Agnish*t*omas
(hence 9 + 20), and adding thereto five more Agnish*t*omas obtained by
the calculation referred to in paragraph 12 (see note thereon),
according to which the characteristic Stotras and Sastras of the Ukthya
make one additional Agnish*t*oma in every four Ukthyas. The
Sho*d*a*s*in, thus, is not taken into account in this calculation.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[152:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_454.md) Besides the
Rathantara and B*ri*hat, used on alternate days for the Hot*ri*'s
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra at the Abhiplava, the Vâmadevya and Kâleya-sâmans,
used on each day for the Maitrâvaru*n*a's and A*kkh*âvâka's
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras, seem to be counted here as making up the four
P*ri*sh*th*a-sâmans of the Abhiplava-sha*d*aha. For the four Stomas, see
[p. 148](sbe44049.htm#page_148.md), note.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[152:2](sbe44050.htm#fr_455.md) See ib., and part
iii, introd., p. xxi.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[152:3](sbe44050.htm#fr_456.md) The 'iva' would
seem here (as, indeed, pretty frequently) to have the meaning of 'eva,'
'indeed,' thus--coming considerably after (the gods). Cf. Ait.-Brâhm.
IV, 17, 5, where the Aṅgiras are said to have reached heaven sixty years
after the Âdityas.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[152:4](sbe44050.htm#fr_457.md) This etymology is
of course not meant to be taken seriously, the word 'p*ri*sh*th*ya'
being derived from 'p*ri*sh*th*a,' 'back' ([XII, 1, 4,
1](sbe44048.htm#12:1:4:1).md).

<span id="fn_458"></span>[153:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_458.md) See [p.
148](sbe44049.htm#page_148.md), note; part iv, p. 287, note 2.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[153:2](sbe44050.htm#fr_459.md) These two
principal P*ri*sh*th*a-sâmans are used on alternate days of the
Abhiplava-sha*d*aha for the first (or Hot*ri*'s) P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra at
the midday-service.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[153:3](sbe44050.htm#fr_460.md) Viz. with the four
Stomas used at the ordinary Agnish*t*oma-sacrifice.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[153:4](sbe44050.htm#fr_461.md) Whilst the
Agnish*t*oma includes twelve Stotras and twelve *S*astras, the
Ukthya-sacrifice has three additional (Uktha-) Stotras and Sastras,
which in the four Ukthya days of the Abhiplava-sha*d*aha make up another
twelve chants and twelve recitations.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[153:5](sbe44050.htm#fr_462.md) That is, either a
descendant of Ku*s*âmba; or, as Harisvâmin takes it, a native of the
city Kau*s*âmbî; cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p.
193.--Prak*ri*sh*t*abhûpati-ko*s*âmbînivâsi-kusurabindasyâpatyam; MS.
comm.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[153:6](sbe44050.htm#fr_463.md) Harisvâmin applies
to the father the epithet 'mahâyâ*gñ*ika,' or performer of the great
sacrifices.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[154:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_464.md) In the scheme of
the Gavâm ayanam, given above ([p. 139](sbe44046.htm#page_139.md), note
[1](sbe44046.htm#fn_425).md), there is one day in excess of the year, viz.
either the central Vishuvat day ([XII, 2, 3, 6](sbe44051.htm#12:2:3:6).md)
or the final Atirâtra; but by making this latter day identical with the
opening Atirâtra, Uddâlaka would seem to bring the whole within the
compass of one year of six seasons. In the next paragraph, on the other
hand, the same result is obtained by the identification of the second
and the last but one days of the session. Another, and perhaps more
probable, explanation of Uddâlaka's calculation would, however, be this.
In the scheme of the sacrificial session there occur, as not included in
the different sacrificial groups or periods (the sha*d*ahas,
svarasâmans, &c.), seven special days--the opening and final Atirâtras,
the *K*aturvi*ms*a and Mahâvrata days, and the Abhi*g*it, Vishuvat, and
Vi*s*va*g*it days. These seven days he here successively reduces to six
and five days. The further reduction of this number by the
identification of the P*ri*sh*th*ya and Abhiplava, as well as of the
Svarasâman days, requires no explanation. Cf., however, the Addenda.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[154:2](sbe44050.htm#fr_465.md) For the 'pâṅkta'
nature of the sacrifice, see III, 1, 4, 19. 20; [XIII, 2, 5,
1](sbe44087.htm#13:2:5:1.md), for the five kinds of sacrificial animals,
VI, 1, 2, 32 seqq.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[155:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_466.md) Prof. Oldenberg
(Zeitschr. d. Deutschen Morg. Ges., vol. 50, p. 460) takes 'upanishad'
in the sense of 'worship'--'this is the worship to be offered to the
year.' Perhaps 'meditation' might be the more appropriate
rendering:--'this is the form in which the year should be meditated
upon.' Cf. X, 4, 5, 1; 5, I, 1.
