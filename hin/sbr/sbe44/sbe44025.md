### FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:1">11:5:1:1</span></span>1. The
nymph Urva*s*î loved Purûravas <span id="fr_228"></span>[3](#fn_228),
the son of I*d*â. When she wedded him, she said,

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Thrice a day
shalt thou embrace <span id="fr_229"></span>[1](#fn_229) me; but do not
lie with me against my will <span id="fr_230"></span>[2](#fn_230), and
let me not see thee naked, for such is the way to behave to us women.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:2">11:5:1:2</span></span>2. She
then dwelt with him a long time, and was even with child of him, so long
did she dwell with him. Then the Gandharvas <span
id="fr_231"></span>[3](#fn_231) said to one another, 'For a long time,
indeed, has this Urva*s*î dwelt among men: devise ye some means how she
may come back to us.' Now, a ewe with two lambs was tied to her couch:
the Gandharvas then carried off one of the lambs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:3">11:5:1:3</span></span>3.
'Alas,' [](errata.htm#0)she cried, 'they are taking away my
darling <span id="fr_232"></span>[4](#fn_232), as if I were where there
is no hero and no man!' They carried off the second, and she spake in
the selfsame manner.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:4">11:5:1:4</span></span>4. He
then thought within himself, 'How can that be (a place) without a hero
and without a man where I am?' And naked, as he was, he sprang

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

up after them: too long he deemed it that he should put on his garment.
Then the Gandharvas produced a flash of lightning, and she beheld him
naked even as by daylight. Then, indeed, she vanished: 'Here I am back,'
he said, and lo! she had vanished <span id="fr_233"></span>[1](#fn_233).
Wailing with sorrow he wandered all over Kurukshetra. Now there is a
lotus-lake there, called Anyata*h*plakshâ: He walked along its bank; and
there nymphs were swimming about in the shape of swans <span
id="fr_234"></span>[2](#fn_234).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:5">11:5:1:5</span></span>5. And
she (Urva*s*î), recognising him, said, 'This is the man with whom I have
dwelt.' They then said, 'Let us appear to him!'--'So be it!' she
replied; and they appeared to him <span id="fr_235"></span>[3](#fn_235).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:6">11:5:1:6</span></span>6. He
then recognised her and implored her (*Ri*g-veda X, 95, I), 'Oh, my
wife, stay thou, cruel in mind <span id="fr_236"></span>[4](#fn_236):
let us now exchange words! Untold, these secrets of ours will not bring
us joy in days to

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

come;'--'Stop, pray, let us speak together!' this is what he meant to
say to her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:7">11:5:1:7</span></span>7. She
replied (X, 95, 2), 'What concern have I with speaking to thee? I have
passed away like the first of the dawns. Purûravas, go home again: I am
like the wind, difficult to catch;'--'Thou didst not do what I had told
thee; hard to catch I am for thee, go to thy home again!' this is what
she meant to say.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:8">11:5:1:8</span></span>8. He
then said sorrowing (X, 95, 14), 'Then will thy friend <span
id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_237) rush away <span
id="fr_238"></span>[2](#fn_238) this day never to come back, to go to
the farthest distance: then will he lie in Nir*ri*ti's <span
id="fr_239"></span>[3](#fn_239) lap, or the fierce wolves will devour
him; Thy friend will either hang himself, or start forth; or the wolves,
or dogs, will devour him!' this is what he meant to say.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:9">11:5:1:9</span></span>9. She
replied (X, 95, 15), 'Purûravas, do not die! do not rush away! let not
the cruel wolves devour thee! Truly, there is no friendship with women,
and theirs are the hearts of hyenas <span
id="fr_240"></span>[4](#fn_240);'--

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Do not take this
to heart! there is no friendship with women: return home!' this is what
she meant to say.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:10">11:5:1:10</span></span>10.
(*Ri*g-veda X, 95, 16), 'When changed in form, I walked among mortals,
and passed the nights there during four autumns <span
id="fr_241"></span>[1](#fn_241) ate a little ghee, once a day, and even
now I feel satisfied therewith <span
id="fr_242"></span>[2](#fn_242).'--This discourse in fifteen verses has
been handed down by the Bahv*rik*as <span
id="fr_243"></span>[3](#fn_243). Then her heart took pity on him <span
id="fr_244"></span>[4](#fn_244).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:11">11:5:1:11</span></span>11.
She said, 'Come here the last night of the year from now <span
id="fr_245"></span>[5](#fn_245): then shalt thou lie with me for one
night, and then this son of thine will have been born.' He came there on
the last night of the year, and lo, there stood a golden palace <span
id="fr_246"></span>[6](#fn_246)! They then

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

said to him only this (word) <span id="fr_247"></span>[1](#fn_247),
'Enter!' and then they bade her go to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:12">11:5:1:12</span></span>12.
She then said, 'To-morrow morning the Gandharvas will grant thee a boon,
and thou must make thy choice.' He said, 'Choose thou for me!'--She
replied, 'Say, Let me be one of yourselves!' In the morning the
Gandharvas granted him a boon; and he said, 'Let me be one of
yourselves!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:13">11:5:1:13</span></span>13.
They said, 'Surely, there is not among men that holy form of fire by
sacrificing wherewith one would become one of ourselves.' They put fire
into a pan, and gave it to him saying, 'By sacrificing therewith thou
shalt become one of ourselves.' He took it (the fire) and his boy, and
went on his way home. He then deposited the fire in the forest, and went
to the village with the boy alone. \[He came back and thought\] 'Here I
am back;' and lo! it had disappeared <span
id="fr_248"></span>[2](#fn_248): what had been the fire was an
A*s*vattha tree (ficus religiosa), and what had been the pan was a
*S*amî tree (mimosa suma). He then returned to the Gandharvas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:14">11:5:1:14</span></span>14.
They said, 'Cook for a whole year a mess of rice sufficient for four
persons; and taking each time three logs from this A*s*vattha tree,
anoint them with ghee, and put them on the fire with

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

verses containing the words "log" and "ghee": the fire which shall
result therefrom will be that very fire (which is required).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:15">11:5:1:15</span></span>15.
They said, 'But that is recondite (esoteric), as it were. Make thyself
rather an upper ara*n*i <span id="fr_249"></span>[1](#fn_249) of
A*s*vattha wood, and a lower ara*n*i of Sami wood: the fire which shall
result therefrom will be that very fire.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:16">11:5:1:16</span></span>16.
They said, 'But that also is, as it were, recondite. Make thyself rather
an upper ara*n*i of A*s*vattha wood, and a lower ara*n*i of A*s*vattha
wood: the fire which shall result therefrom will be that very fire.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:1:17">11:5:1:17</span></span>17.
He then made himself an upper ara*n*i of A*s*vattha wood, and a lower
ara*n*i of A*s*vattha wood; and the fire which resulted therefrom was
that very fire: by offering therewith he became one of the Gandharvas.
Let him therefore make himself an upper and a lower ara*n*i of
A*s*vattha wood, and the fire which results therefrom will be that very
fire: by offering therewith he becomes one of the Gandharvas.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_228"></span>[68:3](sbe44025.htm#fr_228) King Purûravas, of
the lunar race of kings, is considered the <span id="page_69">p.
69</span> son of Budha (the planet Mercury, and son of Soma). On this
myth (based on the hymn *Ri*g-veda S. X, 95) see Prof. Max Müller,
Oxford Essays (1856), p. 61 seqq.; (reprinted in Chips from a German
Workshop, II, p. 102 seqq.); A. Kuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers and des
Göttertranks, p. 81 seqq. (2nd ed. p. 73 seqq.); Weber, Ind. Streifen I,
p. 16 seqq.; K. F. Geldner, in Pischel and Geldner's Vedische Studien I,
p. 244 seqq.; cf. H. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, p. 213.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[69:1](sbe44025.htm#fr_229) Vaitasena da*nd*ena
hatâd,--vaitaso da*nd*a*h* pu*m*vya*ñg*anasya nâma; ukta*m* hi Yâskena,
*s*epo vaitasa iti pu*m*spra*g*ananasyeti (Nir. III, 22), Sây.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[69:2](sbe44025.htm#fr_230) Akâmâ*m*
kâmarahitâ*m* suratâbhilâsharahitâ*m* *k*a mâ*m* mâ sma nipadyâsai
nig*ri*hya mâ*m* prâpnuyâ*h*, Sây.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[69:3](sbe44025.htm#fr_231) The Gandharvas are
the natural companions and mates of the Apsaras, or nymphs.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[69:4](sbe44025.htm#fr_232) Literally, 'my
son,'--madîya*m* putratvena svîk*ri*tam ura*n*advayam, Sây.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[70:1](sbe44025.htm#fr_233) Cf. C. Gaedicke,
Der Accusativ im Veda (1880), p. 211. Previous translators had assigned
the words 'punar emi' (I come back) to Urva*s*î; and in view of the
corresponding passage in [paragraph 13](sbe44025.htm#11:5:1:13), the new
interpretation is just a little doubtful.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[70:2](sbe44025.htm#fr_234) The text has 'âti,'
some kind of water-bird--*g*ala*k*arapakshivi*s*esha*h*, Sây.--(probably
Gr. νῆσσα; Lat. anas, anat-is; Anglo-S. æned, Germ. Ente).

<span id="fn_235"></span>[70:3](sbe44025.htm#fr_235) That is, they
became visible, or rather recognisable to him by showing themselves in
their real forms,--pakshirûpa*m* vihâya svakîyena rûpe*n*a prâdur
babhûvu*h*, Sây.--In Kâlidâsa's plays, both Urva*s*î and *S*akuntalâ
become invisible by means of a magic veil (tiraskari*n*î, 'making
invisible') with which has been compared the magic veil by which the
swan-maidens change their form. A. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 197; A. Kuhn,
Herabkunft, p. 91.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[70:4](sbe44025.htm#fr_236) Manasâ tish*th*a
ghore,--possibly it may mean, 'O cruel one, be thou constant in (thy)
mind;' or, as Kuhn takes it, 'pay attention, O cruel one.' Sâya*n*a,
however, takes it as above.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[71:1](sbe44025.htm#fr_237) This is a doubtful
rendering (Max Müller; Gespiele, A. Weber) of 'sudeva,'--Göttergenoss
(the companion of the gods), Kuhn; 'dem die Götter einst hold waren' (he
who was formerly favoured by the gods), Grassmann; Sudeva, Ludwig.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[71:2](sbe44025.htm#fr_238) Or, will fall down
(Max Müller, Weber); sich in’s Verderben stürzen (will rush to his
destruction), Kuhn;--forteilen (hasten away), Grassmann; verloren gehen
(get lost), Ludwig; sich in den Abgrund stürzen,
Geldner;--'mahâprasthâna*m* kuryât' (he will set out on the great
journey, i.e. die), Sâya*n*a. The Brâhma*n*a seems to propose two
different renderings,--to throw oneself down (hang oneself), or, to
start forth.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[71:3](sbe44025.htm#fr_239) Nir*ri*ti is the
goddess of decay or death.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[71:4](sbe44025.htm#fr_240) The meaning of
'sâlâv*ri*ka,' also spelled '*s*âlâv*ri*ka' (? house-wolves), is
doubtful; cf. H. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 8. Prof. Weber, Ind.
Stud. I, p. 413, makes the suggestion that 'wehrwolves' may be intended.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[72:1](sbe44025.htm#fr_241) The words 'râtrî*h*
*s*arada*s* *k*atasra*h*' may also be taken in the sense of 'four nights
of the autumn' (Max Müller, A. Kuhn). It needs hardly to be remarked
that 'nights' means days and nights, and 'autumns' years.--Sâya*n*a
takes the passage in the sense of 'four delightful (râtrî*h*
ramayitrî*h*) autumns or years.'

<span id="fn_242"></span>[72:2](sbe44025.htm#fr_242) Literally, I walk
(or go on, keep) being satisfied therewith. Prof. Geldner, however,
takes it in an ironical sense, 'das Bischen liegt mir jetzt noch schwer
im Magen' ('even now I have quite enough of that little').

<span id="fn_243"></span>[72:3](sbe44025.htm#fr_243) That is, the
theologians of the *Ri*g-veda. As Prof. Weber points out, the hymn
referred to, in the received version, consists not of fifteen but of
eighteen verses, three of which would therefore seem to be of later
origin (though they might, of course, belong to a different recension
from that referred to by the Brâhma*n*a).

<span id="fn_244"></span>[72:4](sbe44025.htm#fr_244) Or, according to
Prof. Geldner, 'Then he touched her heart (excited her pity).'

<span id="fn_245"></span>[72:5](sbe44025.htm#fr_245) Literally, the
yearliest night, i.e. the 360th night, the last night of a year from
now, or, this night next year: it is the night that completes the year,
just as 'the fifth' completes the number 'five;'--sa*m*vatsaratamî*m*
sa*m*vatsarapûra*n*îm antimâ*m* râtrim, Sây. Cf. Delbrück, Altind.
Syntax, p. 195.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[72:6](sbe44025.htm#fr_246) Hira*n*yavimitâni
hira*n*yanirmitâni saudhâni, Sây.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[73:1](sbe44025.htm#fr_247) Thus also A. Kuhn,
and Sâya*n*a, tato hainam ekam û*k*ur etat, prapadyasveti,--enam
Purûravasa*m* tatratyâ *g*anâ idam ekam û*k*u*h*, Sây.--The word 'ekam'
might also be taken along with 'enam' (Max Müller, Weber,
Geldner),--'they said this to him alone' (? they bade him enter alone
without his attendants).

<span id="fn_248"></span>[73:2](sbe44025.htm#fr_248) See above,
[paragraph 4](sbe44025.htm#11:5:1:4) and note on [p. 70](#page_70).
According to the other interpretation we should have to translate:--He
then deposited the fire in the forest, and went to the village with the
boy alone, thinking, 'I (shall) come back.' \[He came back\] and lo! it
had disappeared.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[74:1](sbe44025.htm#fr_249) That is, a
churning-stick used for producing fire; see part i, p. 275; p. 294, note
3.
