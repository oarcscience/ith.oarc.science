#### HIRA*N*YAVATÎ-ÂHUTI, OR OFFERING WITH GOLD; AND HOMAGE TO THE SOMA-COW.

### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:1">3:2:4:1</span></span>1. Now
Soma was in the sky, and the gods were here on earth. The gods
desired,--'Would that Soma came to us: we might sacrifice with him, when
come.' They created those two illusions, Supar*n*î and Kadrû. In the
chapter on the hearths (dhish*n*ya <span
id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_134).md) it is set forth how that affair of
Supar*n*î and Kadrû came to pass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:2">3:2:4:2</span></span>2.
Gâyatrî flew up to Soma for them. While she was carrying him off, the
Gandharva Vi*s*vâvasu stole him from her. The gods were aware of
this,--'Soma has indeed been removed from yonder (sky), but he comes not
to us, for the Gandharvas have stolen him.'

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:3">3:2:4:3</span></span>3. They
said, 'The Gandharvas are fond of women: let us send Vâ*k* (speech) to
them, and she will return to us together with Soma.' They sent Vâ*k* to
them, and she returned to them together with Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:4">3:2:4:4</span></span>4. The
Gandharvas came after her and said, 'Soma (shall be) yours, and Vâ*k*
ours <span id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_135.md)!' 'So be it!' said the gods;
'but if she would rather come hither, do not ye carry her off by force:
let us woo her!' They accordingly wooed her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:5">3:2:4:5</span></span>5. The
Gandharvas recited the Vedas to her, saying, 'See how we know it, see
how we know it <span id="fr_137"></span>[2](#fn_136.md)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:6">3:2:4:6</span></span>6. The
gods then created the lute and sat playing and singing, saying, 'Thus we
will sing to thee, thus we will amuse thee!' She turned to the gods;
but, in truth, she turned to them vainly, since she turned away from
those, engaged in praising and praying, to dance and song. Wherefore
even to this day women are given to vain things: for it was on this wise
that Vâ*k* turned thereto, and other women do as she did. And hence it
is to him who dances and sings that they most readily take a fancy <span
id="fr_138"></span>[3](#fn_137.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:7">3:2:4:7</span></span>7. Both
Soma and Vâ*k* were thus with the gods. Now, when he buys Soma he does
so in order that he may sacrifice with him, when obtained, for his (own)
obtainment (of heavenly bliss <span id="fr_139"></span>[4](#fn_138).md);
for he who

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

sacrifices with Soma that has not been bought, sacrifices with Soma that
has not been (properly) obtained <span id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_139.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:8">3:2:4:8</span></span>8. In the
first place he pours the butter, which remains in the dhruvâ spoon, in
four parts into the guhû; and having tied a piece of gold with a blade
of the altar-grass <span id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_140.md), and laid it
down (in the *g*uhû), he offers (the butter), thinking, 'I will offer
with pure milk;' for milk and gold are of the same origin, since both
have sprung from Agni's seed <span id="fr_142"></span>[3](#fn_141.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:9">3:2:4:9</span></span>9. He
lays down the piece of gold, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. IV, 17), 'This
(butter) is thy body, O shining (Agni)! this (gold) is thy light,'--for
that gold is indeed light:--'unite therewith and obtain splendour!' When
he says, 'Unite therewith,' he means to say, 'Mingle therewith;' and
when he says, 'Obtain splendour,'--splendour meaning Soma,--he means to
say, 'Obtain Soma.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:10">3:2:4:10</span></span>10. And
as the gods then sent her (Vâ*k*) to Soma, so does he now send her to
Soma; and the cow for which the Soma is bought being in reality Vâ*k*,
it is her he gratifies by this offering, thinking, 'With her, when
gratified, I shall buy the Soma.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:11">3:2:4:11</span></span>11. He
offers, with the text, 'Thou art the singer of praises <span
id="fr_143"></span>[4](#fn_142),'--for this (word '*g*û*h*'.md), the
'singer of praises,' is one of her (Vâ*k*'s) names;--'upholden by the
Mind,'--this speech of ours

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

is indeed upheld by the mind, because the Mind goes before <span
id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_143) Speech (and prompts her.md), 'Speak thus!
say not this!' for, were it not for the Mind, Speech would indeed talk
incoherently: for this reason he says, 'Upholden by the Mind.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:12">3:2:4:12</span></span>12.
'Well-pleasing to Vish*n*u,' whereby he means to say, 'Well-pleasing to
Soma whom we approach <span id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_144.md).' \[He
proceeds, Vâ*g*. S. IV, 18\], 'Inspired by thee of true inspiration,'
whereby he means to say, 'Be thou of true inspiration! go thou to Soma
for us!'--'May I obtain a support for my body, Svâhâ!' for he who
reaches the end of the sacrifice, indeed obtains a support for his body:
hence he thereby means to say, 'May I reach the end of the sacrifice!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:13">3:2:4:13</span></span>13.
Thereupon he takes out the piece of gold (from the spoon), whereby he
bestows gold on men; but were he to offer (the butter) together with the
gold, he would doubtless cast the gold away from men, and no gold would
then be gained among men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:14">3:2:4:14</span></span>14. He
takes it out, with the text, Thou art pure, thou art shining, thou art
immortal, thou art sacred to all the gods.' When, having offered the
whole milk, he now says, 'Thou art pure . . . ,' it is indeed pure, and
shining, and immortal, and sacred to all the gods. Having loosened the
grass-blade, he throws it on the barhis, and ties a string round the
gold <span id="fr_146"></span>[3](#fn_145.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:15">3:2:4:15</span></span>15.
Having then taken butter a second time in

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

four parts, he says, 'Sacrificer, hold on behind <span
id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_146)!' They open the (south and east.md) <span
id="fr_148"></span>[2](#fn_147) doors of the hall (and walk out.md). On the
right side (of the front door) approaches the Soma-cow <span
id="fr_149"></span>[3](#fn_148): (by having.md) her thus put forward <span
id="fr_150"></span>[4](#fn_149), he has sent her forth (to Soma.md); for
the Soma-cow is in reality Vâ*k*: it is her he has gratified by this
offering, thinking, 'With her, when gratified, I will buy Soma.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:16">3:2:4:16</span></span>16.
Having gone up to her, he (the Adhvaryu) salutes her, with the text
(Vâ*g*. S. IV, 19), 'Thou art thought, thou art the mind,'--for speech,
doubtless, speaks in accordance with thought, with the mind <span
id="fr_151"></span>[5](#fn_150.md);--'Thou art intelligence, thou art the
Dakshi*n*â <span id="fr_152"></span>[6](#fn_151.md),'--for it is by means
of their respective intelligence <span id="fr_153"></span>[7](#fn_152.md)
that people seek to make their living, either by reciting (the Veda), or
by readiness of speech <span id="fr_154"></span>[8](#fn_153.md), or by
songs: therefore he says, 'Thou art intelligence;' and 'Dakshi*n*â'
(gift to the priests) he calls her, because she is indeed the
Dakshi*n*â;--

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Thou art supreme,
thou art worthy of worship,'--for she is indeed supreme and worthy of
worship;--'Thou art Aditi, the double-headed,'--inasmuch as, through her
(Vâ*k*, speech), he speaks the right thing wrongly, and puts last what
comes first, and first what comes last, therefore she is double-headed:
that is why he says, 'Thou art Aditi, the double-headed <span
id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_154.md).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:17">3:2:4:17</span></span>17. 'Be
thou for us successful (in going) forward and successful (in coming)
back!' when he says, 'Be thou for us successful (in going) forward,' he
means to say, 'Go to (fetch) Soma for us!' and when he says, 'Be thou
successful (in coming) back,' he means to say, 'Come back to us with
Soma!' This is why he says, 'Be thou for us successful (in going)
forward and successful (in coming) back!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:18">3:2:4:18</span></span>18.
'May Mitra bind thee by the foot!' For that rope, doubtless, is of
Varu*n*a; and were she (the cow) tied with a rope, she would be (under
the power) of Varu*n*a. And, on the other hand, were she not tied at
all, she would be uncontrolled. Now that which is of Mitra is not of
Varu*n*a; and as (a cow), if tied with a rope, is under control, so it
is in the case of this one when he says, 'May Mitra bind thee by the
foot!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:19">3:2:4:19</span></span>19.
'May Pûshan guard thy paths!' Now Pûshan is this Earth, and for
whomsoever she is the guardian of his paths <span
id="fr_156"></span>[2](#fn_155.md), he stumbles not at any time: therefore
he says, 'May Pûshan guard thy paths!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:20">3:2:4:20</span></span>20.
'For Indra as the supreme guide;'--whereby he says, 'May she be
well-guarded!' \[He

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

proceeds, Vâ*g*. S. IV, 20\], 'May thy mother grant thee permission, thy
father, thine own brother, thy fellow in the herd!' whereby he says, 'Go
thou for us to fetch Soma, with the permission of all thy kin.'--'O
goddess, go to the god,'--for it is indeed as a goddess, as Vâ*k*, that
she goes to a god, to Soma: therefore he says, 'O goddess, go to the
god;'--'To Soma for the sake of Indra!' Indra truly is the deity of the
sacrifice: therefore he says, 'To Soma for the sake of Indra.' 'May
Rudra guide thee back!' this he says for her safety, for cattle cannot
pass beyond Rudra <span id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_156.md). 'Hail to thee!
come back, with Soma for thy companion!' whereby he says, 'Hail to thee,
come back to us together with Soma!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:21">3:2:4:21</span></span>21.
Even as, at that time, the gods sent her to Soma, and she returned to
them together with Soma, so does he now send her to Soma, and she
returns to him together with Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:4:22">3:2:4:22</span></span>22. And
as the gods then wooed her with the Gandharvas, and she turned to the
gods, so does the sacrificer now woo her, and she turns to the
sacrificer. They lead her (the Soma-cow) northwards round (to the place
where the Soma is to be sold); for the north is the quarter of men, and
hence it is that of the sacrificer for this reason they lead her
northwards round.

2](sbe2624.htm#3:6:2:2.md) seq.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[53:1](sbe2610.htm#fr_136) 'Yours (shall be.md)
Soma, and ours Vâ*k*, wherewith you bought (Soma) from us.' Kâ*n*va
text.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[53:2](sbe2610.htm#fr_137.md) The G. proclaimed
the sacrifice and Veda to her, saying, 'Thus we know the sacrifice, thus
we know (the Veda); mighty are we.' Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[53:3](sbe2610.htm#fr_138.md) 'And hence it is to
him who is given to vain things, who dances and sings, that women are
most attached.' Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[53:4](sbe2610.htm#fr_139.md) Literally, 'that he
may sacrifice with the arrived (guest) for his own arrival (? in the
world of the gods).'

<span id="fn_139"></span>[54:1](sbe2610.htm#fr_140.md) Lit. 'with Soma that
has not come' (to him as a guest), so that the guest-offering (âtithya,
[III, 4, 1](sbe2615.htm#3:4:1).md) could not take place.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[54:2](sbe2610.htm#fr_141.md) Because of this
piece of gold, the offering here described is called
Hira*n*yavatî-âhuti, or 'offering with gold.'

<span id="fn_141"></span>[54:3](sbe2610.htm#fr_142.md) See II, 1, 1, 5; 3,
1, 15.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[54:4](sbe2610.htm#fr_143.md) The author seems to
take *g*û*h* here as nom. of *g*ur = gur (g*ri*, gir), cf. *g*ûr*n*i.
Some of the native dictionaries give *g*û as one of the names of
Sarasvatî. The St. Petersb. Dict. takes it here in the sense of
'drängend, treibend (pressing forward).'

<span id="fn_143"></span>[55:1](sbe2610.htm#fr_144.md) Mano hîda*m*
purastâd vâ*k*a*s* *k*arati, Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[55:2](sbe2610.htm#fr_145.md) To whom we send you,
K.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[55:3](sbe2610.htm#fr_146.md) The concluding
ceremonies of the Prâya*n*îya (see [III, 2, 3,
23](sbe2609.htm#3:2:3:23).md) are now performed; the offering of the Barhis
being optional, as the barhis may be used again for the Udayanîya (ib.
22). Katy VII, 6, 11 comm.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[56:1](sbe2610.htm#fr_147.md) According to the
Kâ*n*vas, the Adhvaryu's formula is,--Ihi, Ya*g*amâna, 'Go, Sacrificer!'
In Kâty. VII, 6, 1 2 only the above formula is mentioned.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[56:2](sbe2610.htm#fr_148.md) The eastern door is
for the Adhvaryu (and Sacrificer) and the southern for the
Pratiprasthât*ri*.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[56:3](sbe2610.htm#fr_149.md) Soma-kraya*n*î, 'the
cow for which the Soma-is bought.'

<span id="fn_149"></span>[56:4](sbe2610.htm#fr_150.md) Prahita*m* seems to
be taken here in the double sense of 'put forward or in front' (from
pra-dhâ) and despatched (from pra-hi).

<span id="fn_150"></span>[56:5](sbe2610.htm#fr_151.md) 'In accordance with
the thought of the mind,' manaso vai *k*ittam anu vâg vadati, K.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[56:6](sbe2610.htm#fr_152.md) The omission of
'asi' in the Brâhma*n*a is curious; the Kâ*n*va text has correctly
'dakshi*n*âsi.'

<span id="fn_152"></span>[56:7](sbe2610.htm#fr_153.md) Dhiyâ-dhiyâ, or
rather 'by means of this their respective genius (in regard to speech).'
Dhî seems to mean 'thought expressed by speech,' hence often 'prayer,
hymn;' cf. [III, 5, 3, 11](sbe2621.htm#3:5:3:11.md).

<span id="fn_153"></span>[56:8](sbe2610.htm#fr_154.md) Prakâmodya, rather
either 'fondness for talk' or 'effusive speech.' It seems to refer to
story-tellers (? amusing speech).

<span id="fn_154"></span>[57:1](sbe2610.htm#fr_155.md) In Taitt. S. VI, 1,
7, 5, this epithet is explained by the fact that both the prâya*n*îya
and the udayanîya belong to Aditi.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[57:2](sbe2610.htm#fr_156.md) 'And her he thereby
makes the guardian on his path,' imâm evâsmâ etad adhvani goptâra*m*
karoti, K.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[58:1](sbe2610.htm#fr_157.md) Rudra rules over
these (cows); the cattle do not pass beyond (nâtiyanti) him; and thus
she does not pass beyond him: therefore he says, 'May Rudra turn thee
back!' Kâ*n*va text.
