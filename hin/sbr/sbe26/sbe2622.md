### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:1">3:5:4:1</span></span>1. It is
for a twofold reason that the sounding-holes are dug. The cart-shed,
truly, is the head of the sacrificer; and what four holes there are here
in the head--namely, these two and these two <span
id="fr_368"></span>[1](#fn_366.md)--those he thereby makes: for this reason
he digs the sounding-holes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:2">3:5:4:2</span></span>2. Now
the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, were
contending. The Asuras then by way of witchcraft buried charms <span
id="fr_369"></span>[2](#fn_367.md) within these worlds, thinking,
'Peradventure we may thus overcome the gods.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:3">3:5:4:3</span></span>3. The
gods then prevailed. By means of these (sounding-holes) they dug up
those magic charms. Now, when a charm is dug up, it becomes inoperative
and useless. And in like manner, if any malicious enemy buries here
charms by way of witchcraft for this (sacrificer), does he thereby dig
them up; this is why he digs sounding-holes. He digs just beneath the
fore-part of the shafts of the southern cart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:4">3:5:4:4</span></span>4. He
takes up the spade <span id="fr_370"></span>[3](#fn_368.md), with the text
(Vâ*g*. S. V, 22),

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'At the impulse of
the divine Savit*ri*, I take thee with the arms of the A*s*vins, with
the hands of Pûshan: thou art a woman.' The significance of this formula
is the same (as before). That spade (abhri, fem.) is indeed a female:
therefore he says 'thou art a woman.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:5">3:5:4:5</span></span>5. He
draws their outlines, saving <span id="fr_371"></span>[1](#fn_369.md) the
measure of a span, with, 'Here do I cut off the necks of the Rakshas!'
For the spade is the thunderbolt: it is with the thunderbolt that he
thus cuts off the necks of the Rakshas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:6">3:5:4:6</span></span>6. Let
him first mark off the right (southern) one of the two that are in
front; then the left one of the two behind; then the right one of those
behind; then the left one of those in front.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:7">3:5:4:7</span></span>7. But
they say conversely, that he should mark off first the left one of the
two behind; then the right one of those in front; then the right one of
those behind; and then the left one of those in front. Or he may also
mark them off in one and the same direction <span
id="fr_372"></span>[2](#fn_370.md): but let him, in any case, mark off last
of all the one which is on the left of those in front.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:8">3:5:4:8</span></span>8. He
digs them, in the very same order in which they have been marked off,
with, 'Thou art great,

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

of great sound!'--he praises and extols them, when he says, 'Thou art
great, of great sound;'--'Utter thou the great voice unto
Indra!'--Indra, forsooth, is the deity of the sacrifice; and the
cart-shed belonging to Vish*n*u, he thereby makes it to be connected
with Indra: therefore he says, 'Utter thou the great voice unto Indra!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:9">3:5:4:9</span></span>9. 'The
Rakshas-killing, charm-killing (voice),' for it is indeed for the
killing of the charms of the Rakshas that these (holes) are dug;--'Of
Vish*n*u;' for that voice in the cart-shed is indeed Vish*n*u's.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:10">3:5:4:10</span></span>10. He
throws out (the earth from) them in the order in which he has dug them,
with (Vâ*g*. S. V, 23), 'Here do I cast out the charm which the alien,
which the inmate of my house has buried for me!' Either an alien or an
inmate of his house buries charms by way of witchcraft: these he thereby
casts out.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:11">3:5:4:11</span></span>11.
'Here do I cast out the charm which my equal, which my unequal has
buried for me!' Either one equal, or one unequal, to him buries charms
by way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:12">3:5:4:12</span></span>12.
'Here do I cast out the charm which the kinsman, which the stranger has
buried for me!' Either a kinsman or a stranger buries charms by way of
witchcraft: these he thereby casts out.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:13">3:5:4:13</span></span>13.
'Here do I cast out the charm which the countryman, which the foreigner
has buried for me!' Either a countryman or a foreigner buries charms by
way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out. With 'I cast out
witchcraft!' he finally

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

throws out (the earth remaining in the several holes <span
id="fr_373"></span>[1](#fn_371).md), whereby he casts out witchcraft.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:14">3:5:4:14</span></span>14. Let
him dig them arm-deep; for that being the end (extreme limit to which he
can reach) he thereby in the end brings witchcraft to naught. He
connects them crossways by (underground) channels <span
id="fr_374"></span>[2](#fn_372.md); or, if he cannot crossways, he may do
so in one and the same direction. This is why these (openings of the)
vital airs are connected by channels farther (inside).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:15">3:5:4:15</span></span>15. In
the same order in which he has dug them he makes (the sacrificer) touch
them, with the texts (Vâ*g*. S. V, 24), 'Self-ruling thou art, a slayer
of enemies! Ever-ruling thou art, a slayer of haters! Man-ruling thou
art, a slayer of Rakshas! All-ruling thou art, a slayer of foe-men!'
This is the blessing of that work: he thereby invokes a blessing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:16">3:5:4:16</span></span>16. The
Adhvaryu and Sacrificer then touch one another (with their right hands
through the holes), the Adhvaryu is at the right one of those in front,
and the Sacrificer at the left one of those behind. The Adhvaryu asks,
'Sacrificer, what is here?'--'Happiness!' he says.--'(Be) that ours in
common!' says the Adhvaryu in a low voice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:17">3:5:4:17</span></span>17.
Thereupon the Adhvaryu is at the right one of those behind, and the
Sacrificer at the left one of those in front. The Sacrificer asks,
'Adhvaryu, what is here?'--'Happiness!' he says.--'(Be) that mine!' says
the Sacrificer. Now in that they thus

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

touch one another, thereby they make the vital airs yoke-fellows: hence
these vital airs meet together farther (inside). And in that, when
asked, he replies, 'Happiness (bhadram),' thereby he utters the wish of
'prosperity (kalyâ*n*am)' of ordinary speech: that is why, being asked,
he replies, 'Happiness.' Thereupon he sprinkles (the holes with water):
one and the same forsooth is the significance of sprinkling; he thereby
renders them pure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:18">3:5:4:18</span></span>18. He
sprinkles, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. V, 25), 'You, the Rakshas-killers,
the charm-killers;' for they are indeed Rakshas-killers as well as
charm-killers; 'Vish*n*u's own, I sprinkle;' for they indeed belong to
Vish*n*u.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:19">3:5:4:19</span></span>19.
What remains of the sprinkling-water he then pours out into the
pits;--what moisture there is here in the vital airs <span
id="fr_375"></span>[1](#fn_373.md), that he thereby puts into them: hence
that moisture in the vital airs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:20">3:5:4:20</span></span>20. He
pours it out with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers,
Vish*n*u's own, I pour out.' Thereupon he spreads barhis-grass, both
such as is turned with its tops to the east and such as is turned to the
north <span id="fr_376"></span>[2](#fn_374.md); what hair there is here at
(the openings of) the vital airs, that he thereby bestows: hence that
hair at (the openings of) the vital airs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:21">3:5:4:21</span></span>21. He
spreads it with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers,
Vish*n*u's own, I spread.' He, as it were, covers the bodies on the top,
for that (grass) is indeed his (Vish*n*u's) hair <span
id="fr_377"></span>[3](#fn_375.md).

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:22">3:5:4:22</span></span>22.
Thereon he lays two pressing-boards <span
id="fr_378"></span>[1](#fn_376.md) with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the
charm-killers, Vish*n*u's own, I lay down;' they are indeed his
(Vish*n*u's) jaws. He surrounds them (with earth) with, 'You, the
Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers, Vish*n*u's own, I surround;' he
thereby steadies them, makes them immovable.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:23">3:5:4:23</span></span>23. Now
the pressing-skin is cut straight all round and (dyed) red all over, for
it is his (Vish*n*u's) tongue: the reason, then, why it is quite red, is
because this tongue is, as it were, red. He lays it down with, 'Thou art
Vish*n*u's own;' for it indeed belongs to Vish*n*u <span
id="fr_379"></span>[2](#fn_377.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:4:24">3:5:4:24</span></span>24. He
then brings down the (five) press-stones. The press-stones, doubtless,
are his (Vish*n*u's) teeth: hence, when they press (the Soma) with the
stones it is as if he chewed with his teeth. He puts them down with, 'Ye
are Vish*n*u's own;' for they indeed belong to Vish*n*u. Thus, then, the
head of the sacrifice is complete.

ni*k*akhnu*h*, 'they dug in, as a charm, secret (magic) objects.' Valaga
is explained as charms, consisting of bones, nails, hair, foot-dust, and
similar objects, tied up in a piece of worn matting or cloth, or the
like, and dug into the ground arm-deep, for causing injury to enemies.

that space between each two adjoining uparavas. They are themselves to
be round, a span in diameter. Hence by connecting the four centres by
lines, a square of two spans (of thumb and forefinger), or one cubit, is
obtained. See Baudh. *S*ulvas. 101.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[136:2](sbe2622.htm#fr_372.md) That is,
successively the south-eastern, the south-western, the north-western,
and last, the north-eastern hole.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[138:1](sbe2622.htm#fr_373.md) That is, these
words are to be pronounced at the end of each of the preceding four
formulas, and the remaining loose soil is therewith to be removed from
the respective hole.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[140:1](sbe2622.htm#fr_378.md) The pressing-boards
are a cubit long, and somewhat broader behind than in front. They are
placed one south of the other, and so as to lie close together behind
(sambaddhânte, Kâ*n*va rec.), or the space of two inches between them.
The space between them is filled up with earth.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[140:2](sbe2622.htm#fr_379.md) East of the
'sound-holes' he raises a square mound (khara), covered with gravel, for
placing vessels on, Kâty. VIII, 5, 28.
