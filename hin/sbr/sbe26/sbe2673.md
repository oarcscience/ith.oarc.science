### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:4:1">4:6:4:1</span></span>1. Then
as to the Mahâvratîya (graha) <span id="fr_1001"></span>[2](#fn_995).
Now when Pra*g*âpati had created the living beings, his

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

joints were relaxed: with his relaxed joints he was unable to raise
himself. Then the gods went on praising and toiling. They saw this
Mahâvratîya (cup) and drew it for him: thereby they restored his joints.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:4:2">4:6:4:2</span></span>2. With
his joints thus restored, he approached this food, what food of
Pra*g*âpati there is,--for what eating is to men, that the vrata
(fast-food, or religious observance generally) is to the gods. And
because (they say), 'Great, indeed, is this vrata whereby he has raised
himself,' therefore it is called Mahâvratîya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:4:3">4:6:4:3</span></span>3. Now,
even as Pra*g*âpati then was, when he had created the living beings, so
are those who sit (in sacrificial session) for a year; and as
Pra*g*âpati then, after a year, approached food, so do they now, after a
year, approach food, for whomsoever that knows this, they draw that cup.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:4:4">4:6:4:4</span></span>4. Let
him draw it for Indra Vim*ri*dh (the Averter of scorn), for, verily, the
scorners of those who sit for

<span id="page_431">p. 431</span>

a year are smitten, and all is won by them: hence for Indra
Vim*ri*dh,--with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 44; Rig-veda X, 152, 4), 'Scatter thou
our scorners, O Indra, lay them low that war against us, and send them,
that persecute us, to the nethermost darkness!--Thou art taken with a
support: thee to Indra Vim*ri*dh!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra
Vim*ri*dh!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:4:5">4:6:4:5</span></span>5. Or for
Vi*s*vakarman (the All-worker), for all work is done, everything is won
by those who sit in session for a year: hence for Vi*s*vakarman,--with
(Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 45; Rig-veda X, 81, 7), 'Vâ*k*aspati Vi*s*vakarman, the
thought-speeder <span id="fr_1002"></span>[1](#fn_996), let us invoke
for protection in our struggle <span id="fr_1003"></span>[2](#fn_997)
this day: may he, the all-beneficient worker of good, delight in all our
offerings <span id="fr_1004"></span>[3](#fn_998) for our
protection!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra
Vi*s*vakarman <span id="fr_1005"></span>[4](#fn_999)!--This is thy womb;
thee to Indra Vi*s*vakarman!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:4:6">4:6:4:6</span></span>6. But if
he knows the (verse) referring to Indra (and) Vi*s*vakarman, let him
draw it thus <span id="fr_1006"></span>[5](#fn_1000) (Vâ*g*. S. VIII,
46), 'O Vi*s*vakarman, with strengthening libation madest thou Indra an
invincible champion: to him did the people bow down of

<span id="page_432">p. 432</span>

old, because <span id="fr_1007"></span>[1](#fn_1001) he, the mighty, is
worthy of adoration.--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra
Vi*s*vakarman!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Vi*s*vakarman!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_995"></span>[429:2](sbe2673.htm#fr_1001) The drawing of
this cup forms part of the performance of the last but one day of the
Gavâm ayana, the so-called Mahâvrata (great vow) day, on which the
following particulars are supplied by Kâtyâyana XIII, 2, 16 seq. The
particular form of sacrifice prescribed for the day is the Agnish*t*oma.
A victim to Pra*g*âpati is to be immolated. The Mahâvratîya-graha is
drawn as an additional libation (like the Atigrâhyas,). The signal for
the chanting of the P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras is given by (a Brâhman)
playing, with a rattan plectrum, on a harp with a hundred strings of
<span id="page_430">p. 430</span> Mu*ñg*a grass. During the chanting and
recitation, the Udgât*ri* sits on an arm-chair, the Hot*ri* on a hammock
or swing, the Adhvaryu on a board, and the other priests on cushions of
grass. Then follow several curious ceremonies, performed partly inside
and partly outside the Vedi. The performance of the Sattra is
alternately lauded and vituperated by two persons \[the one, a Brâhman,
seated at the front door of the Sadas; the other, a *S*ûdra, at the back
door; both facing each other;--thus Lâ*t*y. IV, 3, according to which
authority, however, they are merely to say respectively, 'These Sattrins
have not succeeded!'--'They have succeeded!'\] At the same time a harlot
and a theological student (brahma*kh*ârin) upbraid one another (in front
of the Âgnîdhrîya fire shed); while (south of the Mâr*g*âlîya) a sham
contest takes place between an Ârya (Vai*s*ya) and a *S*ûdra for the
possession of a round white skin, the *S*ûdra having to give in (after
the third effort, when the Ârya beats him with the skin). Thereupon a
couple is shut up in an enclosed space south of the Mâr*g*âlîya (or
behind the Âgnîdhrîya, Lâ*t*y.) for maithuna.

<span id="fn_996"></span>[431:1](sbe2673.htm#fr_1002) Or, the
thought-swift (mano*g*û).

<span id="fn_997"></span>[431:2](sbe2673.htm#fr_1003) For the different
meanings of 'vâ*g*a' see Max Müller, 'India, what can it teach us?' p.
164.

<span id="fn_998"></span>[431:3](sbe2673.htm#fr_1004) Or, in all our
invocations (havana).

<span id="fn_999"></span>[431:4](sbe2673.htm#fr_1005) The identification
of Vi*s*vakarman with Indra was probably suggested by the final pâda of
the preceding verse of the hymn (Rig-veda X, 81, 6): 'May there be (or
may he, Vi*s*vakarman, be) for us a Sûri Maghavan' (a rich patron; terms
frequently applied to Indra). But cp. Muir, O. S. T. vol. iv, p. 7.

<span id="fn_1000"></span>[431:5](sbe2673.htm#fr_1006) The Kâ*n*va text
does not give the verse, but remarks merely,--But if he can get (vindet)
an aindrî vai*s*vakarma*n*î (verse), let him draw it therewith.

<span id="fn_1001"></span>[432:1](sbe2673.htm#fr_1007) I see no other
way of rendering 'yathâ-asat' in this passage.
