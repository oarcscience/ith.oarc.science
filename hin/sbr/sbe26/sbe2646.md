### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:1">4:2:2:1</span></span>1. The
Âgraya*n*a graha, forsooth, is his self (body, trunk), and as such it is
his all; for this self is one's all. Therefore he draws it by means of
this (earth), for of her is the bowl <span
id="fr_698"></span>[2](#fn_696.md), and with a bowl he draws this
(libation); and this (earth) is all, as this

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

graha is all: hence he takes it by means of this (earth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:2">4:2:2:2</span></span>2. He
draws it full; for the 'full' means all, and this graha is all:
therefore he draws it full.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:3">4:2:2:3</span></span>3: He
draws it for the All-gods; for the All-gods are all, and this graha is
all: therefore he draws it for the All-gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:4">4:2:2:4</span></span>4. He
draws it at all (three) Soma feasts; for the (three) feasts mean all,
and this graha is all: therefore he draws it at all the feasts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:5">4:2:2:5</span></span>5. And if
the king (Soma) become exhausted, they extend him from out of that
(bowl), make him issue therefrom; for the Âgraya*n*a is the body, and
from the body all these limbs issue. Therefrom they draw at the end the
Hâriyo*g*ana cup <span id="fr_699"></span>[1](#fn_697.md): whereby the
sacrifice is established at the end in this resting-place, the body (or
its own self).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:6">4:2:2:6</span></span>6. Then
as to why it is called Âgraya*n*a. His speech which he restrains, on
taking up that press-stone <span id="fr_700"></span>[2](#fn_698.md), spoke
out again first at this (libation); and because it spoke out first
(agre) at this (libation), therefore this is called the Âgraya*n*a <span
id="fr_701"></span>[3](#fn_699.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:7">4:2:2:7</span></span>7. It was
from fear of the evil spirits that (the gods) restrained their speech.
Previously to this he draws six grahas, and this is the seventh: for
there are six seasons in the year, and the year is all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:8">4:2:2:8</span></span>8. And
all being conquered and free from danger and injury <span
id="fr_702"></span>[4](#fn_700.md), the gods now first uttered speech; and

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

in like manner does he first utter speech now that everything is
conquered and free from danger and injury.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:9">4:2:2:9</span></span>9. He now
draws it from that (stream of Soma <span
id="fr_703"></span>[1](#fn_701).md) with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 19; Rig-veda I,
139, 11), 'Ye Gods, who are eleven in heaven, who are eleven on earth,
and who are eleven dwelling in glory in the (aerial) waters: do ye
graciously accept this sacrifice!--Thou art taken with a support: thou
art Âgraya*n*a, a good firstling (sv-âgraya*n*a)!' Hereby he makes that
speech of renewed vigour; whence he speaks therewith in a different way,
while yet the same, in order to avoid sameness; for were he to take it
with, 'Thou art Âgraya*n*a, thou art Âgraya*n*a,' he would commit (the
fault of) sameness: therefore he says, 'Thou art Âgraya*n*a, a good
âgraya*n*a.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:10">4:2:2:10</span></span>10.
'Guard the sacrifice! guard the lord of the sacrifice!' whereby he
utters freed speech, meaning to say, 'Protect the sacrifice! protect the
sacrificer!' for the lord of the sacrifice is the sacrificer. 'May
Vish*n*u-guard thee with his might! guard thou Vish*n*u!' whereby he
utters freed speech--Vish*n*u being the sacrifice--'May the sacrifice

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

protect thee with its power! protect thou the sacrifice!'--'Guard thou
the Soma feasts all around!' whereby he means this very graha, because
that belongs to all (three) Soma feasts <span
id="fr_704"></span>[1](#fn_702.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:11">4:2:2:11</span></span>11.
Having then wrapped up (the bowl in) a fringed filtering-cloth, he
utters 'Hiṅ!' Now that same speech (Vâ*k*, fem.), being unsupported, lay
exhausted. By means of the 'Hiṅ' the gods infused breath into that
exhausted speech, for the 'Hiṅ' is breath, the 'Hiṅ' is indeed breath:
hence one cannot utter the sound 'hiṅ' after closing his nostrils. By
means of that breath she rose again, for when one who is exhausted takes
breath, he rises again. And in like manner does he now infuse breath
into the exhausted speech by means of the 'Hiṅ,' and through. that
breath she rises again. Thrice he utters the 'Hiṅ,' for threefold is the
sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:12">4:2:2:12</span></span>12. He
then says (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 21), 'Soma becometh pure!' For that (speech)
which, for fear of the Asura-Rakshas, they (the gods) did not utter, he
now utters and reveals when all is conquered and free from danger and
injury: therefore he says, 'Soma becometh pure.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:13">4:2:2:13</span></span>13.
'For this priesthood, for this nobility'--whereby he means to say, 'for
the priesthood as well as for the nobility for the Soma-pressing
sacrificer he becometh pure;' whereby he means to say, 'for the
sacrificer.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:14">4:2:2:14</span></span>14.
Here now they say, 'Having said this much, let him deposit (the cup);
for as much as the priesthood, and the nobility, and the people are, so
much

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

means this All, since Indra and Agni are this All <span
id="fr_705"></span>[1](#fn_703.md): hence, having said this much, let him
deposit (the cup).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:15">4:2:2:15</span></span>15. Let
him, nevertheless, say this more, 'For sap and pith he becometh
pure,'--by saying 'for sap' he means to say 'for rain;' and 'for pith'
he says with a view to that pith or juice which springs from rain;--'for
the waters and plants he becometh pure,' this he says for the waters and
plants;--'for heaven and earth he becometh pure,' this he says for those
two, heaven and earth, whereon this All rests;--'for well-being he
becometh pure,' whereby he means to say 'for good.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:2:16">4:2:2:16</span></span>16.
Here now some say, 'for spiritual lustre he becometh pure;' but let him
not say so, for in saying 'for this priesthood,' he says it with a view
to spiritual lustre. With, 'Thee for the All-gods! this is thy womb:
thee for the All-gods!' he deposits (the cup); for it is for the
All-gods that he draws it. He deposits it in the middle (of the mound);
for this is his trunk, and that trunk is, as it were, in the middle. On
the right (south) side of it is the Ukthya bowl, and on the left side
the Âditya bowl.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_695"></span>[288:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_697.md) The order of the
dhish*n*ya-priests is (1. Hot*ri*), 2. Pra*s*âst*ri* (Maitrâvaru*n*a),
3. Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin, 4. Pot*ri*; 5. Nesh*tri*, 6. A*kh*âvâka--the
fires of all of whom are in the Sadas--and 7. the Agnîdh (in the
Âgnîdhra fire-house). The A*kh*âvaka, however, is for the present
excluded from offering.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[288:2](sbe2646.htm#fr_698.md) Viz. inasmuch as
the bowl is made of clay,--asyâ*h* p*ri*thivyâ*h* sakâ*s*ât sthâlî
bhavati utpadyate; Sây. The Âgraya*n*a, Ukthya, and Dhruva grahas are
drawn in a sthâlî (pot or bowl).

<span id="fn_697"></span>[289:1](sbe2646.htm#fr_699.md) See [IV, 4, 3,
2](sbe2657.htm#4:4:3:2.md).

<span id="fn_698"></span>[289:2](sbe2646.htm#fr_700.md) The Upâ*ms*usavana,
cf. [III, 9, 4, 6](sbe2639.htm#3:9:4:6.md).

<span id="fn_699"></span>[289:3](sbe2646.htm#fr_701.md) The primary meaning
seems to be 'firstling.' For the Âgraya*n*esh*t*i, or offering of
first-fruits, see part i, p. 369.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[289:4](sbe2646.htm#fr_702.md) Or perhaps, 'and
their entire conquest being free from danger and injury;' or, 'security
and peace (abhayam anâsh*t*ram) having <span id="page_290">p. 290</span>
been completely gained.' Cf. [IV, 3, 3, 5](sbe2652.htm#4:3:3:5.md); also
[III, 6, 3, 11](sbe2625.htm#3:6:3:11); [8, 1, 9](sbe2631.htm#3:8:1:9.md);
[8, 2, 3](sbe2632.htm#3:8:2:3.md).

<span id="fn_701"></span>[290:1](sbe2646.htm#fr_703.md) The Âgraya*n*a is
taken rather from two streams of Soma, viz. from that poured by the
sacrificer from the Hot*ri*'s cup into the Dro*n*akala*s*a, and from
another poured out by the Unnet*ri*, and consisting either of Soma taken
from the Âdhavanîya or, according to others, of the residue of the
Upâ*ms*u libation, which had been temporarily kept in the Âgraya*n*a
bowl (see [p. 255](sbe2640.htm#page_255), note [2](sbe2640.htm#fn_618).md),
and has to be emptied by the Unnet*ri* into some other vessel, when that
bowl is about to be used for the Âgraya*n*a libation. See Kâty. IX, 6,
15 comm.

<span id="fn_702"></span>[291:1](sbe2646.htm#fr_704.md) The Âgraya*n*a
libation is repeated at the midday as well as at the evening feast.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[292:1](sbe2646.htm#fr_705.md) On Indra and Agni,
as the divine representatives of the two privileged castes, see part i,
Introd. p. xvi seq.
