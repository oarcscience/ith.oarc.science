#### THE DVÂDA*S*ÂHA <span id="fr_939"></span>[2](#fn_935.md).

### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:1">4:5:4:1</span></span>1. Now,
at first the gods were all alike, all good. Of them, being all alike,
all good, three desired, 'May we be superior <span
id="fr_940"></span>[3](#fn_936.md)!'--Agni, Indra, and Sûrya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:2">4:5:4:2</span></span>2. They
went on praising and toiling. They saw those Atigrâhyas <span
id="fr_941"></span>[4](#fn_937), and drew (grah.md) them for themselves

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

over and above (ati): hence the name Atigrâhyas. They became superior,
even as they are now superior <span id="fr_944"></span>[1](#fn_938.md) and
verily he becomes superior for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw those
cups of Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:3">4:5:4:3</span></span>3. And at
first there was not in Agni that lustre which is now in him. He desired,
'May that lustre be in me!' He saw this graha, and drew it for himself,
and henceforth that lustre was in him.

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:4">4:5:4:4</span></span>4. And at
first there was not in Indra that power which is now in him. He desired,
'May that power be in me!' He saw this graha and drew it for himself,
and henceforth that power was in him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:5">4:5:4:5</span></span>5. And at
first there was not in Sûrya that splendour which is now in him. He
desired, 'May that splendour be in me!' He saw this graha and drew it
for himself, and henceforth that splendour was in him. And verily for
whomsoever, knowing this, they draw those cups of Soma, he takes unto
himself those same fires (energies), those same powers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:6">4:5:4:6</span></span>6. Let
him draw them at the morning pressing, after drawing the Âgraya*n*a; for
the Âgraya*n*a is the self (body), and many parts of this self are one
each (and thus) over and above (the others), such as the lung <span
id="fr_945"></span>[1](#fn_939.md) and heart, and others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:7">4:5:4:7</span></span>7. Or he
might draw them from the Pûtabh*ri*t, at the midday pressing, after
drawing the Ukthya, or when about to bespeak (the chant), for the Ukthya
indeed is the same as that undefined self of his. But this is mere
speculation: let him rather draw them at the morning pressing, after
drawing the Âgraya*n*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:8">4:5:4:8</span></span>8. They
are offered after the offering of the Mâhendra graha; for that, the
Mâhendra, is Indra's special cup; and so are the (Nishkevalya) stotra
and *s*astra specially his. But the sacrificer is Indra; and for the
sacrificer's benefit (these cups) are drawn: therefore they are offered
after the offering of the Mâhendra graha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:9">4:5:4:9</span></span>9. He
thus draws them therefrom \[the first with

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vâ*g*. S. VIII,
38; Rig-veda IX, 66, 21\] <span id="fr_946"></span>[1](#fn_940.md), 'O
Agni, skilful in works, become thou pure, bestowing upon us lustre and
manly vigour, and upon me health and wealth!--Thou art taken with a
support: thee to Agni, for lustre!--This is thy womb: thee to Agni, for
lustre!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:10">4:5:4:10</span></span>10.
\[The second with Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 39; Rig-veda VIII, 76, 10\], 'Uprising
by thy power didst thou move thy jaws, O Indra, drinking the cup-drawn
juice!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra for power!--This is
thy womb: thee to Indra for power!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:11">4:5:4:11</span></span>11.
\[The third with Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 40; Rig-veda I, 50, 3\], 'His beacons
have appeared, his beams, wide and far over the people, shining
splendidly like fires!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Sûrya for
splendour!--This is thy womb: thee to Sûrya for splendour!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:12">4:5:4:12</span></span>12. The
drinking of these (cups is performed by the sacrificers with the resp.
texts), 'O lustrous Agni, lustrous art thou among the gods: may I be
lustrous among men!--Most powerful Indra, most powerful art thou among
the gods: may I be the most powerful among men!--Most splendid Sûrya,
most splendid art thou among the gods: may I be the most splendid among
men!' And, verily, these same splendours, these same powers he takes
unto himself for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw these cups.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:13">4:5:4:13</span></span>13. Let
him draw them on the first three days of the P*ri*sh*th*ya
sha*d*aha <span id="fr_947"></span>[2](#fn_941.md); namely, the Agni cup on

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

the first day, the Indra cup on the second, the Sûrya cup on the
third--thus one day by day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:4:14">4:5:4:14</span></span>14.
Some <span id="fr_948"></span>[1](#fn_942.md), however, draw them on the
last three days; but let him not do so: let him rather draw them on the
first three days. But should he intend to draw them on the last three
days, let him first draw them on the first three days and let him then
draw them on the last three days. In like manner they are drawn (all
three) in their proper order, on one and the same day, at the
Vi*s*va*g*it <span id="fr_949"></span>[2](#fn_943.md) with all the
P*ri*sh*th*as.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_935"></span>[402:2](sbe2663.htm#fr_943.md) The Dvâda*s*âha, or
twelve days’ performance, forms the connecting link between the
so-called Ahîna sacrifices (consisting of between two and twelve
press-days) and the sattras, or sacrificial sessions (of twelve
press-days and upwards); since it can be performed as one or the other.
As a sattra (which seems to be its usual character) it consists of the
Da*s*arâtra, or ten nights’ (or days’) period, preceded and followed by
an Atirâtra, as the prâya*n*îya (opening) and udayanîya (concluding)
days. The Da*s*arâtra, on its part, consists of three tryahas (or
tridua), viz. a P*ri*sh*th*ya sha*d*aha (see note  <span
id="fr_942"></span>[4](#fn_937).md), and three Ukthya days, the so-called
*Kh*andomas (on which see Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 347). These are
followed by an Atyagnish*t*oma day, called Avivâkya (i.e. on which there
should be 'no dispute, or quarrel').

<span id="fn_936"></span>[402:3](sbe2663.htm#fr_940.md)
Ati-tish*th*âvâna*h*, lit. 'standing forth over (all others,' see [IV,
5, 3, 2](sbe2662.htm#4:5:3:2).md). In this, as in the preceding Brâhma*n*a,
the prefix ati has to do service repeatedly for etymological and
symbolical purposes.

<span id="fn_937"></span>[402:4](sbe2663.htm#fr_942.md) I.e. cups of Soma
'to be drawn over and above' (Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 235; for a different
explanation see Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 490). These three grahas are
required at the P*ri*sh*th*ya sha*d*aha, which forms part of the
Dvâda*s*âha (see note  <span id="fr_943"></span>[2](#fn_935).md), and of
sacrificial sessions generally. The sha*d*aha, or period of six Soma
days, which (though itself consisting of two tryaha, or <span
id="page_403">p. 403</span> tridua) may be considered as forming a kind
of unit in sattras, or sacrificial sessions, is of two kinds, viz. the
Abhiplava sha*d*aha and the P*ri*sh*th*ya sha*d*aha. Both require (for
the Hot*ri*'s p*ri*sh*th*a-stotra at the midday pressing) the use of the
Rathantara-sâman on uneven, and that of the B*ri*hat-sâman on even days.
The chief difference between them is that while the p*ri*sh*th*a-stotras
of the Abhiplava are performed in the ordinary (Agnish*t*oma) way, the
P*ri*sh*th*ya sha*d*aha requires their performance in the proper
p*ri*sh*th*a form, see [p. 339](sbe2652.htm#page_339.md), note
[2](sbe2652.htm#fn_801.md). Besides, while the Abhiplava sha*d*aha consists
of four Ukthya days, preceded and followed by one Agnish*t*oma day; the
first day of the P*ri*sh*th*ya sha*d*aha is an Agnish*t*oma, the fourth
a Sho*d*a*s*in, the remaining four days being Ukthyas. There is also a
difference between the two in regard to the stomas, or forms of
chanting, used; for while the P*ri*sh*th*ya requires successively one of
the six principal stomas (from the Triv*ri*t up to the Trayastri*ms*a,
as given [p. 308](sbe2649.htm#page_308), note [2](sbe2649.htm#fn_745).md)
for each day, the Abhiplava requires the first four stomas (Triv*ri*t to
Ekavi*ms*a) for each day, though in a different order. In this respect,
three groups or forms are assumed for the performance of the stotras at
the Agnish*t*oma and Ukthya, viz. the *G*yotish*t*oma \[a.
Bahishpavavamâna in the Triv*ri*t; b. Â*g*yastotras and c.
Mâdhyandina-pavamâna in the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a; d. the P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras
and e. Ârbhava-pavavamâna in the Saptada*s*a; and f. the Agnish*t*oma
sâman in the Ekavi*ms*a stoma\]; the Gosh*t*oma \[a. Pa*ñk*ada*s*a; b.
Triv*ri*t; c. Saptada*s*a; e. f. (and g. Ukthastotras) Ekavi*ms*a\]; and
Âyush*t*oma \[a. Triv*ri*t; b. Pa*ñk*ada*s*a; c. d. Saptada*s*a; e. f.
g. Ekavi*ms*a\]. These forms are distributed over the two tridua of the
Abhiplava in the order: *G*yotish*t*oma, Gosh*t*oma, Âyush*t*oma;
Gosh*t*oma, Âyush*t*oma, Gyotish*t*oma.

<span id="fn_938"></span>[403:1](sbe2663.htm#fr_944.md) Lit. even as they
are now the superiority, i.e. a superior power.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[404:1](sbe2663.htm#fr_945.md) That is, the right
lung (kloman), the left lung being called by a different name. See St.
Petersb. Dict. s. v.

<span id="fn_940"></span>[405:1](sbe2663.htm#fr_946.md) The Kâ*n*vas use a
different formula, viz. Rig-veda IX, 66, 19. See Vâ*g*. S. ed. Weber, p.
254 (XII).

<span id="fn_941"></span>[405:2](sbe2663.htm#fr_947.md) See page
[402](sbe2662.htm#page_402), note [4](#fn_937.md). In conjunction with the
Rathantara <span id="page_406">p. 406</span> (Sâma-veda II, 30-31) and
B*ri*hat (II, 159-60) sâmans, the other four principal p*ri*sh*th*a
sâmans--viz. the Vairûpa (II, 212-13), Vairâ*g*a (II, 277-9), *S*âkvara
(II, 1151-3; or Mahânâmnî, 1-3), and Raivata (II, 434-6)--are used
respectively by the Hot*ri* on the last four days of the sha*d*aha. As
regards the Hot*ri*'s assistants, while the Maitrâvaru*n*a always uses
the same sâman, as at the Agnish*t*oma, viz. the Vâmadevya (II, 32-34),
the sâmans used by the other Hotrakas are given in the Sâma-veda
immediately after the respective sâman of the Hot*ri*, mentioned above.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[406:1](sbe2663.htm#fr_948.md) The Kâ*n*va text
ascribes this practice to the *K*arakas.

<span id="fn_943"></span>[406:2](sbe2663.htm#fr_949.md) Regarding the
sacrificial session, called Gavâm ayana, of which the Vi*s*va*g*it forms
part, see [p. 426](sbe2670.htm#page_426), note [3](sbe2671.htm#fn_988.md).
