#### THE UPASADS, OR HOMAGES.

### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:1">3:4:4:1</span></span>1. Verily
the Upasads (homages or sieges) are the neck of the sacrifice, and the
Pravargya is its head. Hence when it is performed with the
Pravargya <span id="fr_273"></span>[3](#fn_272.md),

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

they perform the Upasads <span id="fr_274"></span>[1](#fn_273.md) after
performing the Pravargya, and thereby they put the neck in its place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:2">3:4:4:2</span></span>2. The
anuvâkyâs (invitatory prayers) in the forenoon are the yâ*g*yâs
(offering prayers) in the afternoon; and the yâ*g*yâs are the
anuvâkyâs <span id="fr_275"></span>[2](#fn_274.md). He thus interlinks
them, whence those joints and those bones of the neck are interlinked.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:3">3:4:4:3</span></span>3. Now
the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, were
contending against each other <span id="fr_276"></span>[3](#fn_275.md). The
Asuras then built themselves castles in these worlds,--an iron one in
this world, a silver one in the air, and a golden one in the sky.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:4">3:4:4:4</span></span>4. The
gods then prevailed. They besieged them by these sieges (upasad); and
because they besieged (upa-sad) them, therefore the name Upasads.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They clove the
castles and conquered these worlds. Hence they say, 'A castle is
conquered by siege;' for it is indeed by beleaguering that one of these
human castles is taken.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:5">3:4:4:5</span></span>5. By
means of these sieges, then, the gods clove the castles and conquered
these worlds. And so does this one (the sacrificer) now,--no one, it is
true, builds for himself castles against him in this world; he cleaves
these same worlds, he conquers these worlds: therefore he offers with
the Upasads.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:6">3:4:4:6</span></span>6. They
have clarified butter for their offering material. For ghee is a
thunderbolt, and by that thunderbolt, the ghee, the gods clove the
strongholds and conquered these worlds. And so does he cleave these
worlds by that thunderbolt, the ghee, and conquer these worlds;
therefore they (the Upasads) have ghee for their offering material.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:7">3:4:4:7</span></span>7. He
takes eight times (ghee) in the *g*uhû, and four times in the
upabh*ri*t; or conversely, they say, he is to take of it only four times
in the *g*uhû and eight times in the upabh*ri*t <span
id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_276.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:8">3:4:4:8</span></span>8. He
takes eight times in the *g*uhû, and four times in the upabh*ri*t. He
thereby makes the thunderbolt heavy in front, and with that thunderbolt
heavy in front he cleaves these worlds, and conquers these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:9">3:4:4:9</span></span>9. Agni
and Soma verily are yoke-fellows among the gods: for these two he takes
(ghee) in common <span id="fr_278"></span>[2](#fn_277.md). For Vish*n*u (he
takes) singly. He makes only the one libation (âghâra) which (he makes)
with the dipping-spoon (sruva) <span id="fr_279"></span>[3](#fn_278.md).
For when he has made

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

the northern (higher) libation he retires <span
id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_279.md): 'May I conquer for conquest' so he
thinks, and therefore he makes only the one libation, that with the
dipping-spoon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:10">3:4:4:10</span></span>10.
When he has called on the Âgnîdhra) for the *S*rausha*t*,-- he does not
elect the Hot*ri* <span id="fr_281"></span>[2](#fn_280.md). 'Seat thee, O
Hot*ri*!' he says. The Hot*ri* sits down on the Hot*ri*'s seat. Having
sat down he urges the Adhvaryu; and he, thus urged, takes the two
offering-spoons <span id="fr_282"></span>[3](#fn_281.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:11">3:4:4:11</span></span>11.
While passing over (to the south side of the fire and altar) he
says <span id="fr_283"></span>[4](#fn_282) (to the Hot*ri*.md), 'Recite the
invitatory prayer to Agni!' and having called for the *S*rausha*t*, he
says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer to Agni!' and pours out the
oblation when the Vasha*t* is uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:12">3:4:4:12</span></span>12.
Thereupon he says, 'Recite the invitatory prayer to Soma!' and having
called for the *S*rausha*t*, he says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer to
Soma!' and pours out the oblation when the Vasha*t* is uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:13">3:4:4:13</span></span>13.
Thereupon, while pouring the ghee which is in the upabh*ri*t <span
id="fr_284"></span>[5](#fn_283.md), together (with what is left in the
guhû), he says, 'Recite the invitatory prayer to Vish*n*u!' and, having
called for the *S*rausha*t*, he says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer to
Vish*n*u!'

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

and pours out the oblation when the Vasha*t* is uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:14">3:4:4:14</span></span>14. The
reason why in offering he remains standing in one and the same place,
and does not move about as he is wont to do here in performing, is that
he thinks 'I will conquer for conquest <span
id="fr_285"></span>[1](#fn_284.md)!' And the reason why he offers to those
deities is that he thereby constructs the thunderbolt: Agni (he makes)
the point (anîka), Soma the barb (*s*alya), and Vish*n*u the connecting
piece (kulmala) <span id="fr_286"></span>[2](#fn_285.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:15">3:4:4:15</span></span>15. For
the thunderbolt is the year the day is Agni, the night Soma, and what is
between the two, that is Vish*n*u. Thus he makes the revolving year.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:16">3:4:4:16</span></span>16. The
thunderbolt is the year: by that year, as a thunderbolt, the gods clove
the strongholds and conquered these worlds. And so does he now by that
year, as a thunderbolt, cleave these worlds, and conquer these worlds.
This is why he offers to those gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:17">3:4:4:17</span></span>17. Let
him undertake three Upasads; for, there being three seasons in the year,
it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the year.
He performs twice each.

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:18">3:4:4:18</span></span>18.
These amount to six; for, there being six seasons in the year, it is
thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the year.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:19">3:4:4:19</span></span>19. And
should he undertake twelve Upasads,--there being twelve months in the
year, it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the
year. He performs twice each.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:20">3:4:4:20</span></span>20.
These amount to twenty-four;--there being twenty-four half-moons in the
year, it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the
year.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:21">3:4:4:21</span></span>21. As
to his performing in the evening and in the morning,--it is because only
thus completeness is obtained. When he performs in the forenoon, then he
gains the victory;--and when he performs in the afternoon, he does so
that it may be a good (complete) victory;--and when he offers the Homa,
(it is as if) people fight here for a stronghold, and having conquered
it, they enter it as their own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:22">3:4:4:22</span></span>22.
When he performs (the upasads), he fights; and when (the performance) is
completed, he conquers; and when he offers the Homa <span
id="fr_287"></span>[1](#fn_286), he enters that (stronghold.md) now his
own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:23">3:4:4:23</span></span>23. He
offers it (with the verse) with which he

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

will have to perform twice in one day <span
id="fr_288"></span>[1](#fn_287) (Vâ*g*. S. V, 8.md), 'What most excellent
iron-clad body is thine, O Agni, established in the deep, it hath chased
away the cruel word, it hath chased away the fearful word; Hail!' for
such-like it was, it was indeed iron.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:24">3:4:4:24</span></span>24.
Again he offers (with the verse) with which he will have to perform
twice in one day, 'What most excellent silver-clad body is thine, O
Agni, established in the deep, it hath chased away the cruel word, it
hath chased away the fearful word; Hail!' for such-like it was, it was
indeed silver.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:25">3:4:4:25</span></span>25. And
again he offers (with the verse) with which he will have to perform
twice in one day, 'What most excellent gold-clad body is thine, O Agni,
established in the deep, it hath chased away the cruel word, it hath
chased away the fearful word; Hail!' for such-like it was, it was indeed
golden. If he undertakes twelve Upasads, let him perform each of them
for four days.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:26">3:4:4:26</span></span>26. Now
then of the fast-homages. Some Upasads get wider and wider, others
narrower and narrower: those at which he milks out one (teat) <span
id="fr_289"></span>[2](#fn_288.md) on the first day, then two, and then
three, are those that get wider and wider; and those at which he

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

milks out three on the first day, then two, and then one, are those that
get narrower and narrower. Those getting narrower and narrower are (as
good as) those getting wider and wider; and those getting wider and
wider are (as good as) those getting narrower and narrower.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:4:27">3:4:4:27</span></span>27.
Verily, the world is conquered by austere devotion. Now, his devotion
becomes ever and ever wider, he conquers an ever and ever more glorious
world and becomes better even in this world, whosoever, knowing this,
undertakes the Upasads that get narrower and narrower <span
id="fr_290"></span>[1](#fn_289.md): let him, therefore, undertake the
Upasads that get narrower and narrower. And should he undertake twelve
Upasads, let him have three (teats) milked out for four days, two for
four days, and one for four days.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_272"></span>[104:3](sbe2618.htm#fr_273.md) The Pravargya, an
offering of heated milk, which precedes each performance of the
Upasads,--except at the first performance of the Soma-sacrifice, when it
is prohibited by many authorities,--seems originally to have been an
independent ceremony, and as such it is treated by most ritualistic
books apart from the exposition of the Soma-cult. The
*S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a deals with it in XIV, 1-3 (Vâ*g*. S. XXXIX). Its
mystic significance appears to have been that of supplying the
sacrificer with a new celestial body. There seems to have been a
tendency towards exalting its <span id="page_105">p. 105</span>
importance--if not, indeed, towards making it take the place of the
Soma-cult. The hot milk (gharma) is even styled 'Samrâ*g*' or supreme
king--as against the title 'râ*g*an' or king, assigned to Soma; and a
throne is provided for it, just as for the latter. The rules for its
performance, according to the Âpastamba *S*rauta-sûtra, have been
published, with a translation, by Professor Garbe (Zeitsch. der D. M. G.
XXXIV, p. 319 seq.). See also Haug's Transl. of the Ait. Br. pp. 41-43;
Weber, Ind. Stud. IX. pp. 218-220.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[105:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_274.md) The Upasada*h*,
consisting of three offerings of ghee to Agni, Soma, and Vish*n*u,
followed by a Homa, have to be performed twice daily, for at least three
days (the normal number at the Agnish*t*oma). The first day's
performance is called (from the corresponding Homa) the 'aya*hs*ayâ'
(lying in iron, made of iron), the second day's 'ra*g*a*hs*ayâ'
(silvern),and the third day's 'hari*s*ayâ' (golden). If there are six,
or twelve Upasad days, each of the three varieties of performance has
assigned to it an equal number of successive days; and if there are more
than twelve the three varieties are to be performed alternately.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[105:2](sbe2618.htm#fr_275.md) For the anuvâkyâs
and yâ*g*yâs, as well as the kindling-verses (sâmidhenîs) to be recited
at the Upasads, see Ait. Br. I, 26; Â*s*v. IV, 8.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[105:3](sbe2618.htm#fr_276.md) For other versions
of this myth, see Ait. Br. I, 23; Taitt. S. VI, 2, 3.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[106:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_277.md) This would be the
regular mode of ladling. See 1, 3, 2, 8 seq.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[106:2](sbe2618.htm#fr_278.md) See [p.
108](#page_108), note [1](#fn_284.md).

<span id="fn_278"></span>[106:3](sbe2618.htm#fr_279.md) For the two âghâra,
or libations of ghee, made with the <span id="page_107">p. 107</span>
sruva north of the fire and *g*uhû south of the fire respectively, see
I, 4, 4, 1 seq. At the Upasad-ish*t*i neither fore-offerings (prayâ*g*a)
nor after-offerings (anuyâ*g*a) are performed.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[107:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_280.md) Viz. to the
offering place on the south side of the fire. The covert meaning is
that, were he to make the second libation, he would have to recede front
the higher (uttara, northern) position already gained.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[107:2](sbe2618.htm#fr_281.md) See I, 5, 1, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[107:3](sbe2618.htm#fr_282.md) See I, 5, 2, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[107:4](sbe2618.htm#fr_283.md) See I, 7, 2, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[107:5](sbe2618.htm#fr_284.md) Of the ghee in the
*g*uhû (obtained from eight ladlings with the <span id="page_108">p.
108</span> sruva) he first offers one half each to Agni and Soma.
Thereupon he pours the ghee from the upabh*ri*t (obtained from four
ladlings with the sruva) into the *g*uhû and offers it to Vish*n*u.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[108:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_285.md) 'It is for conquest
that he does not move about as he (does when he) performs here in any
other sacrifice.' Kâ*n*va recension.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[108:2](sbe2618.htm#fr_286.md) ? The socket;
compare Ait. Br. I, 25, 'The gods constructed that arrow, the Upasads:
Agni was its point (? anîka, shaft, Haug), Soma its barb (*s*alya,
steel, H.), Vish*n*u its shaft (te*g*anam, point, H.), and Varu*n*a its
feathers (par*n*a) . . . . For the arrow consists of three parts, anîka,
*s*alya, and te*g*ana . . . . For the arrow consists of two parts,
*s*alya and te*g*ana.' Here *s*alya would seem to be the barbed
head-piece (with the point, anîka), and te*g*ana the shaft or reed of
the arrow.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[109:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_287.md) On the completion
of each performance of the Upasad offerings, after the anointing of the
prastara (see I, 8, 3, 11-14) and previously to taking up the
enclosing-sticks (ib. 22), a homa (or *g*uhoti) offering (part i, p.
263, note 2), called Upasad-homa, has to be performed with the
dipping-spoon; the sacrificer holding on to Adhvaryu from behind, while
the ghee is poured into the fire. Its performance over, the Upasads are
brought to an end by a repetition of the ceremony with the prastara
(which is not burnt) described above, [III, 4, 3,
22](sbe2617.htm#3:4:3:22.md), and the minor concluding ceremonies (I, 8, 3,
23 seq.; 9, 2, 19 seq.); whereupon the Subrahma*n*yâ litany ([III, 3, 4,
17](sbe2614.htm#3:3:4:17).md) is recited.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[110:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_288.md) While the Hot*ri*,
as we saw ([parag. 2](sbe2618.htm#3:4:4:2), above.md), uses the same two
verses twice in one day, viz. one for the anuvâkyâ in the morning and
for the yâ*g*yâ in the afternoon; and the other for the yâ*g*yâ in the
morning and for the anuvâkyâ in the evening,--the Adhvaryu is to use the
three formulas here mentioned on the three Upasad days respectively,
both at the morning and afternoon performances.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[110:2](sbe2618.htm#fr_289.md) Viz. of the
vratadughâ, or cow supplying his fast-milk. The milk so obtained is to
be his only food during the Upasad days.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[111:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_290.md) The simile is
apparently taken from the arrow, which pierces the deeper the more
pointed it is; cf. [parag. 14](sbe2618.htm#3:4:4:14.md), above; Ait. Br. I,
25. Also Taitt. S. VI, 2, 3, 5, where a goad (âra?) is compared.
