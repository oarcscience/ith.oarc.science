### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:1">3:8:3:1</span></span>1. For
the same deity for which there is a victim, he subsequently prepares a
sacrificial cake <span id="fr_500"></span>[2](#fn_498.md). The reason why
he subsequently prepares a cake is this. Rice and barley, truly, are the
sacrificial essence of all animals (victims) <span
id="fr_501"></span>[3](#fn_499.md); with that same essence he now completes
that (victim) and makes it whole. This is why he subsequently prepares a
sacrificial cake.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:2">3:8:3:2</span></span>2. And
why he proceeds with that cake after performing (offering) with the
omentum is this. It is from the middle (of the victim) that this omentum
is pulled out, and from the middle he now completes that (victim) by
means of that sacrificial essence and makes it whole; therefore he
proceeds with that cake after performing with the omentum. The relation
of

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

this (cake to the animal offering), indeed, is one and the same
everywhere; that cake is prepared after (and supplementary to) a victim.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:3">3:8:3:3</span></span>3.
Thereupon he cuts up the victim: 'Move thrice <span
id="fr_502"></span>[1](#fn_500.md), and make the heart the uppermost of the
thrice-moved!' thus (he says to the slaughterer), for threefold is the
sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:4">3:8:3:4</span></span>4. He
then instructs the slaughterer: 'If one ask thee, "Is the sacrificial
food cooked, O *S*amitar?" say thou only "Cooked!" not "Cooked, reverend
sir!" nor "Cooked, forsooth!"'

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:5">3:8:3:5</span></span>5. Having
then taken clotted ghee with the *g*uhû, the Adhvaryu, stepping up (from
the altar) to (the *S*âmitra), asks, 'Is the sacrificial food cooked, O
*S*âmitar?' 'Cooked,' he says. 'That is of the gods,' says the Adhvaryu
in a low voice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:6">3:8:3:6</span></span>6. The
reason why he asks is this. Cooked, forsooth, not uncooked (must be) the
gods' food; and the *S*amit*ri* indeed knows whether it is cooked or
uncooked.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:7">3:8:3:7</span></span>7. And
again, why he asks. 'I will perform with cooked (food),' so he thinks;
and if that sacrificial food be uncooked, it is yet cooked food for the
gods, and is cooked as regards the Sacrificer; and the Adhvaryu is
guiltless; on the slaughterer that guilt lies. Thrice he asks, for
threefold is the sacrifice. And as to his saying, 'That is of the gods,'
that which is cooked, indeed, belongs to the gods; therefore he says,
'That is of the gods.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:8">3:8:3:8</span></span>8. The
heart he bastes (with clotted ghee) first of all; for the heart is the
self (soul), the mind; and the clotted ghee is the breath; he thus puts
the breath into its (the victim's) self, into its mind; and thus it
verily becomes the living food of the gods, and immortal for the
immortals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:9">3:8:3:9</span></span>9. He
bastes it with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 18), 'May thy mind unite with the mind;
thy breath with the breath!' He utters no Svâhâ ('hail'), for this is
not an oblation. They remove the victim (from the cooking-fire) <span
id="fr_503"></span>[1](#fn_501.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:10">3:8:3:10</span></span>10.
'They take it along the back of the pit, and

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

between the sacrificial stake and the (Âhavanîya) fire. The reason why,
though it is cooked, they do not take it across the middle (of the
altar), as they take other sacrificial dishes, is 'lest they should
bring the sacrifice in the middle in connection with that which is cut
up by limbs and mangled.' And why they do not take it outside (the
altar) in front of the stake, is that they would thereby put it outside
the sacrifice: therefore they take (the flesh) along between the stake
and the fire. When they have put it down south (of the fire), the
Pratiprasthât*ri* cuts off (the portions). There are Plaksha
branches <span id="fr_504"></span>[1](#fn_502) (Ficus Infectoria.md) by way
of an upper barhis (covering of altar); thereon he cuts. The reason why
there are Plaksha branches by way of an upper barhis is this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:11">3:8:3:11</span></span>11. For
when the gods, at first, seized an animal to sacrifice), Tvash*tri*
first spat upon its head, thinking, 'Surely, thus they will not touch
it!' for animals belong to Tvash*tri*. That (spittle became) the brain
in the head and the marrow in the neck-bone <span
id="fr_505"></span>[2](#fn_503): hence that (substance.md) is like spittle,
for Tvash*tri* spat it. Let him therefore not eat that, since it was
spitten by Tvash*tri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:12">3:8:3:12</span></span>12. Its
sacrificial essence flowed down and there a tree sprang up. The gods
beheld it; wherefore it (was called) 'prakhya' (visible), for 'plaksha,'

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

doubtless, is the same as 'prakhya.' With that same sacrificial essence
he now completes it (the victim), and makes it whole: hence there are
Plaksha branches as an upper covering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:13">3:8:3:13</span></span>13. He
then makes an 'underlayer' of ghee both in the *g*uhû and the
upabh*ri*t, and in the vasâhomahavanî <span
id="fr_506"></span>[1](#fn_504.md), and the samavattadhânî <span
id="fr_507"></span>[2](#fn_505.md); and puts a piece of gold <span
id="fr_508"></span>[3](#fn_506.md) both in the *g*uhû and the upabh*ri*t.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:14">3:8:3:14</span></span>14.
Thereupon he addresses (the Hot*ri*) for the recitation on the havis to
the manotâ deity <span id="fr_509"></span>[4](#fn_507.md). The reason why
he addresses him for the recitation on the havis to the manotâ deity is
this. All the deities draw nigh to the victim while it is immolated,
thinking, 'My name he will choose, my name he will choose!' for the
animal victim is sacrificial food for all deities. The minds (manas),
then, of all those deities are, fixed upon (ota) that victim; those
(minds of theirs) he thereby satisfies, and thus the minds of the gods
have not drawn nigh in vain. For this reason he addresses him for the
recitation on the havis to the manotâ deity.

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:15">3:8:3:15</span></span>15. He
first makes a portion of the heart <span
id="fr_510"></span>[1](#fn_508.md). The reason why he first makes a portion
of the heart which is in the middle, is that the heart is the breath,
since it is from there that this breath moves upward <span
id="fr_511"></span>[2](#fn_509.md); and the animal is breath, for only so
long does the animal (live) as it breathes with the breath; but when the
breath departs from it, it lies there useless, even (as) a block of
wood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:16">3:8:3:16</span></span>16. The
heart, then, is the animal; thus he first makes a portion of its very
self (or soul). And, accordingly, if any portion were omitted, he need
not heed this, since it is of his entire animal victim that the first
portion is made which is made of the heart. He therefore first makes a
portion of the heart, that being in the middle. Thereupon according to
the proper order.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:17">3:8:3:17</span></span>17.
Then of the tongue, for that stands out from its fore-part. Then of the
breast, for that also (stands out) therefrom <span
id="fr_512"></span>[3](#fn_510.md). Then of the simultaneously moving
(left) fore-foot <span id="fr_513"></span>[4](#fn_511.md). Then of the
flanks. Then of the liver. Then of the kidneys.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:18">3:8:3:18</span></span>18. The
hind-part he divides into three parts; the broad piece (he reserves) for
the by-offerings <span id="fr_514"></span>[5](#fn_512.md); the middle one
he cuts into the guhû after dividing it in two; the narrow piece (he
reserves) for the

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

tryaṅga <span id="fr_515"></span>[1](#fn_513.md). Then of the
simultaneously moving (right) haunch <span
id="fr_516"></span>[2](#fn_514.md). This much, then, he cuts into the
*g*uhû.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:19">3:8:3:19</span></span>19.
Then into the upabh*ri*t, he makes a portion of the upper part of the
fore-foot belonging to the tryaṅga (viz. the right one); of the (narrow
piece of the) hind-part, after dividing it in two; and of the haunch
belonging to the tryaṅga (viz. the left). Thereupon he puts two pieces
of gold on (the flesh oblations in the spoons) and pours ghee thereon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:20">3:8:3:20</span></span>20. He
then takes the oblation of gravy <span id="fr_517"></span>[3](#fn_515.md)
with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 18), 'Thou art trembling,' for quivering, as it
were, is the broth: hence he says, 'Thou art trembling;'--'May Agni
prepare <span id="fr_518"></span>[4](#fn_516.md) thee!' for the fire does
indeed cook it: hence he says, 'May Agni prepare thee!'--'The waters
have washed thee together,' for the water indeed gathers together that
(fat) juice from the limbs: hence he says, 'The waters have washed thee
together.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:21">3:8:3:21</span></span>21.
'For the sweeping of the wind--thee!' for verily yonder blower sweeps
along the air, and for the air he takes it: hence he says, 'For the
sweeping of the wind (I take) thee.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:22">3:8:3:22</span></span>22.
'For the speed of Pûshan,'--Pûshan's speed, forsooth, is yonder
(wind) <span id="fr_519"></span>[5](#fn_517.md), and for that he takes it:
hence he says, 'For the speed of Pûshan.'

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:23">3:8:3:23</span></span>23.
'From the hot vapour may totter--;' the hot vapour, namely, is yonder
(wind), and for that he takes it: hence he says, 'From the hot vapour
may totter--.' Thereupon he bastes it twice with ghee above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:24">3:8:3:24</span></span>24. He
then mixes it either with the crooked knife or with the
chopping-knife <span id="fr_520"></span>[1](#fn_518.md), with '--Confounded
hatred <span id="fr_521"></span>[2](#fn_519.md)!' whereby he chases away
from here those evil spirits, the Rakshas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:25">3:8:3:25</span></span>25. The
broth which is left he pours into the Samavattadhânî, and therein he
throws the heart, tongue, breast, the broad piece (of the back part),
the kidneys, and the rectum. He then bastes it twice with ghee above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:26">3:8:3:26</span></span>26. The
reason why there is a piece of gold on each side is this. When they
offer up the victim in the fire, they slay it, and gold means immortal
life: thereby then it rests in immortal life; and so it rises from
hence, and so it lives. This is why there is a piece of gold on each
side.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:27">3:8:3:27</span></span>27. And
because he cuts crossways,--of the left fore-foot and the right haunch;
and of the right forefoot and the left haunch,--therefore this animal
draws forward its feet crossways. But were he to cut straight on, this
animal would draw forward its feet (of the same side) simultaneously:
therefore he cuts crossways. Then as to why he does not make cuttings of
the head, nor the shoulders, nor the neck, nor the hind-thighs.

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:28">3:8:3:28</span></span>28. Now
the Asuras, in the beginning, seized a victim. The gods, from fear, did
not go near it <span id="fr_522"></span>[1](#fn_520.md). The Earth <span
id="fr_523"></span>[2](#fn_521.md) then said unto them, 'Heed ye not this:
I will myself be an eye-witness thereof, in whatsoever manner they will
perform this (offering).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:29">3:8:3:29</span></span>29. She
said, 'Only one oblation have they offered, the other they have left
over.' Now that which they left over are these same portions. Thereupon
the gods made over three limbs to (Agni) Svish*t*ak*ri*t, whence the
Tryaṅga oblations. The Asuras then made portions of the head, the
shoulders, the neck, and the hind-thighs: therefore let him not make
portions of these. And since Tvash*tri* spat upon the neck, therefore
let him not make a portion of the neck. Thereupon he says (to the
Hot*ri*), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Agni and Soma for the havis
of the buck!' Having called for the *S*rausha*t*, he says (to the
Maitrâvaru*n*a), 'Prompt (the Hot*ri* to recite the
offering-prayer <span id="fr_524"></span>[3](#fn_522) for.md) the havis of
the buck to Agni and Soma!' He does not say '(the havis) made ready:'
when the Soma has been pressed he says 'made ready.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:30">3:8:3:30</span></span>30. In
the interval between the two half-verses of the offering-prayer he
offers the oblation of gravy. It is from out of this that that essence
(juice) has risen upwards here,--that sap of this earth whereby
creatures exist on this side of the sky <span
id="fr_525"></span>[4](#fn_523.md); for the

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

oblation of gravy is sap, and essence is sap: thus he renders the sap
strong by means of sap, whence this sap when eaten does not perish.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:31">3:8:3:31</span></span>31. And
as to why he offers the oblation of gravy in the interval between the
two half-verses of the offering-prayer,--one half-verse, forsooth, is
this earth, and the other half-verse is yonder sky. Now between the sky
and the earth is the air, and it is to the air that he offers: therefore
he offers the oblation of gravy between the two half-verses of the
offering-prayer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:32">3:8:3:32</span></span>32. He
offers with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 19), 'Drink the ghee, ye drinkers of ghee!
Drink the gravy, ye drinkers of gravy! thou art the havis of the air,
Hail!' With this prayer to the All-gods he offers, for the air belongs
to the All-gods: because creatures move about here in the air breathing
in and breathing out therewith, therefore it belongs to the All-gods. As
the Vasha*t* (of the offering-prayer for the meat portions) is
pronounced, he offers the portions that are in the *g*uhû.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:33">3:8:3:33</span></span>33.
Thereupon, while taking clotted ghee with the *g*uhû, he says (to the
Hot*ri*), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the Lord of the forest!'
Having called for the *S*rausha*t*, he says (to the Maitrâvaru*n*a),
'Prompt (the Hot*ri* to recite the offering-prayer) to the lord of the
forest!' and offers, as the Vasha*t* is pronounced <span
id="fr_526"></span>[1](#fn_524.md). The reason why he offers to the lord of
the forest (the tree) is,--he thereby makes that thunderbolt, the
sacrificial stake, a sharer (in the sacrifice); and, the lord of the
forest being Soma <span id="fr_527"></span>[2](#fn_525.md),

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

he thereby makes the victim to be Soma. And as to his offering (to the
tree) between the two oblations, he thus fills both completely:
therefore he offers between the two oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:34">3:8:3:34</span></span>34.
Thereupon, while pouring together the meat portions that are for the
upabh*ri*t, he says (to the Hot*ri*), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to
Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t (the maker of good offering)!' Having called for
the *S*rausha*t*, he says (to the Maitrâvaru*n*a), 'Prompt for Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t!' and offers as the Vasha*t* is pronounced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:35">3:8:3:35</span></span>35.
With what is left of the offering of gravy, he then sprinkles the
quarters, with, 'The regions,--the fore-regions,--the by-regions,--the
intermediate regions,--the upper regions,--to the regions, Hail!' For
the offering of gravy is sap: thus he imbues all the regions with sap,
and hence sap is obtained here on earth in every region.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:36">3:8:3:36</span></span>36.
Thereupon he touches (what remains of) the victim <span
id="fr_528"></span>[1](#fn_526.md): now is the time for the touching. And
whether he has touched it before, fearing 'those (evil spirits) that
hover near will tear it about,' or whether he be not afraid <span
id="fr_529"></span>[2](#fn_527.md) of its being torn about, let him in any
case now touch (the victim).

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:3:37">3:8:3:37</span></span>37.
\[Vâ*g*. S. VI, 20\], 'To Indra belongeth the out-breathing: may it
attend <span id="fr_530"></span>[1](#fn_528.md) to every limb! To Indra
belongeth the in-breathing: it is attended to in every limb.' Where it
has been cut up limb by limb, there he heals it by means of the
out-breathing and in-breathing.--'O divine Tvash*tri*, let thine ample
(forms) closely unite together, that it be uniform what is of different
shape:' whereby he makes it completely enclosed (in its limbs and
flesh). 'May thy friends, thy father and mother <span
id="fr_531"></span>[2](#fn_529.md), to please thee, joyfully welcome thee
going to the gods!' Thus, having made it whole wherever he has offered
(a piece of) it, he afterwards unites it firmly, and that body (self) of
it is complete in yonder world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_498"></span>[199:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_500.md) The technical name
of this cake to Indra and Agni is pa*s*u-purodâ*s*a (animal-cake). The
anuvâkyâ and yâ*g*yâ for the chief oblation, are Rig-veda I, 93, 2 and 6
respectively; for the Svish*t*ak*ri*t, III, I, 23, and III, 54, 22; Adv.
III, 8, 1; 5, 9. For a similar performance, described in detail, see
note on III, 2, 5, 22.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[199:3](sbe2633.htm#fr_501.md) On the sacrificial
essence passing successively from man into the horse, the ox, the goat,
and finally into the rice and barley, see I, 2, 3, 6-7.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[200:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_502.md) The order of
proceeding is not quite clear from the context, and seems to have
puzzled the later ritualists. From Kâty. VI, 7-8 it would seem that the
author of the Sûtras means the performance of the cake-offering to go on
simultaneously with the cutting up of the victim (and the cooking of the
portions and roasting of the beast). The comm. on Kâty. VI, 7, 29,
however, protests against this arrangement as contrary to the order laid
down in the Brâhma*n*a; and insists especially on the 'atha (now)' at
the beginning of this paragraph. This particle is, however, often used
in a vague sense; as very frequently when, after sketching the chief
course of performance, the author turns back to fill in the details.
There seems also a difference of opinion as to the exact meaning of the
above direction given by the Adhvaryu to the Samitar after (as would
seem) the portions have been cooked. The commentator on Kâty. VI, 8, 1
apparently takes 'tri*h* pra*k*yâvaya' in the sense of 'shake thrice' or
'turn thrice.' Sâya*n*a, on the other hand, explains it as meaning that
the *S*amit*ri* is to divide the portions into three parts, according to
whether they are destined for the chief offerings, or the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t, or the by-offerings (?). As the direction cannot refer
to the taking out of the portions from the cooking-vessel (ukhâ) it
would seem that the *S*amitar is either to move (shake) the vessel
itself, or to stir the contents, perhaps hereby separating the
respective portions. The Kâ*n*va text reads, Tri*h* pra*k*yâvayâd ity
uttame pra*k*yâva uttamârdhe h*ri*daya*m* kurutâd iti. The heart, when
done, is to be removed from the spit and laid on the portions; whereupon
the Adhvaryu pours ghee on the portions ([paragraph
8](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:8).md).

<span id="fn_501"></span>[201:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_503.md) The Adhvaryu
removes the dish northwards from the fire, takes the portions out of it,
puts them into some kind of basket, and performs 'prâ*n*adâna' ([p.
196](sbe2632.htm#page_196), note [3](sbe2632.htm#fn_488).md) on them.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[202:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_504.md) Or, the Plaksha
branches with which the altar was covered on the preceding night. See
[p. 120](sbe2619.htm#page_120), note [3](sbe2619.htm#fn_320.md). The
Kâ*n*va text (as Taitt. S. VI, 3, 10, 2) speaks of one Plaksha branch
put on the barhis.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[202:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_505.md) Anûka, of which
anûkya is the adjective, means 'the forepart of the spinal column.' The
Kâ*n*va text reads,--yan mastishko yad anûke ma*gg*â.

<span id="fn_504"></span>[203:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_506.md) That is, the ladle
used (as a substitute for the *g*uhû) for offering the fat-liquor or
gravy. See [paragraph 20](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:20.md).

<span id="fn_505"></span>[203:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_507.md) That is, the vessel
used for holding the cuttings (samavatta) of the i*d*â; also called
i*d*âpâtrî, see part i, p. 219, note 3.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[203:3](sbe2633.htm#fr_508.md) See [p.
198](sbe2632.htm#page_198), note [1](sbe2632.htm#fn_493.md).

<span id="fn_507"></span>[203:4](sbe2633.htm#fr_509.md) Thereupon he says,
'Recite to the manotâ (deity) the invitatory prayer for (of) the havis
which is being cut in portions (havisho ’vadîyamânasya).' Kâ*n*va text;
cf. Ait. Br. II, 10.--While the sacrificial portions are being cut into
the respective spoons, the Hot*ri* recites the Hymn to Agni, Rig-veda
VI, 1, 1-13, beginning, 'Thou, O wondrous Agni, the first thinker
(manot*ri*) of this hymn, wert verily the priest. . . .' From the
occurrence of this word manotâ, the latter has come to be the technical
name both of the hymn itself and of the deity (Agni) to whom it is
recited.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[204:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_510.md) Literally, he makes
a cutting of the heart (h*ri*dayasya-avadyati), that is to say, he puts
the entire heart into the *g*uhû as an offering-portion.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[204:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_511.md) Etasmâd dhy ayam
ûrdhva*h* prâ*n*a u*kk*arati, Kâ*n*va rec.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[204:3](sbe2633.htm#fr_512) Or, that (comes.md)
after that (tongue): tad dhi tato ’nvak, Kâ*n*va rec.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[204:4](sbe2633.htm#fr_513.md) According to Kâty.
VI, 7, 6, it is the foremost (or upper) joint (pûrvana*d*aka) of the
left fore-foot which is taken. The Kâ*n*va text has simply 'atha
dosh*n*a*h*.'

<span id="fn_512"></span>[204:5](sbe2633.htm#fr_514.md) See [III, 8, 4,
9](sbe2634.htm#3:8:4:9.md) seq.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[205:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_515.md) Literally, the
three-limbs, the technical name of the portion for Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[205:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_516.md) For
'athaika*k*arâyai *s*ro*n*e*h*' the Kâ*n*va text reads 'áthấdhyûdhasa*h*
*s*ró*n*e*h*,' of the hip above the udder.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[205:3](sbe2633.htm#fr_517.md) Vasâ, i.e. the
melted fat (and juice) mixed with the water in which the portions have
been cooked, and forming a rich gravy, offered with the Vasâhomahavanî.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[205:4](sbe2633.htm#fr_518.md) Literally,
'mix'--*s*rî, this root being here, as usual, confounded with *sri*, to
cook.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[205:5](sbe2633.htm#fr_519.md) Esha viva pûshâ yo
’yam pavata etasmâ u hi g*ri*h*n*âti, Kâ*n*va recension.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[206:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_520.md) *S*âsena vâ
pâr*s*vena vâ, Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[206:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_521.md) This forms part of
the preceding formula (as subject to the verb 'may totter'), though the
author seems to separate it therefrom, as does Mahîdhara. The meaning of
the formula seems to be, 'May the enemies perish, confounded by (?) the
hot vapour!'

<span id="fn_520"></span>[207:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_522.md) The St. Petersburg
Dict. takes 'Na-upâveyu*h*' in the sense of 'they did not fall in
therewith; they did not feel inclined for it;' as above, [III, 7, 3,
3](sbe2629.htm#3:7:3:3.md). Sâya*n*a explains it by 'nopâgatâ*h*' (MSS.
nâpâgatâ*h*).

<span id="fn_521"></span>[207:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_523.md) That is, Aditi,
according to the Kâ*n*va recension.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[207:3](sbe2633.htm#fr_524.md) The yâ*g*yâ and
anuvâkyâ are I, 93, 3 and 7 respectively.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[207:4](sbe2633.htm#fr_525.md) Ito vâ ayam ûrdhva
u*kkhri*to raso yam idam imâ*h* pra*g*â upa*g*îvanty arvâg divo ’sminn
antarikshe, Kâ*n*va recension.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[208:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_526.md) For the formulas
used with this oblation, as well as the Svish*t*ak*ri*t, see Haug,
Transl. Ait. Br. pp. 95-96 notes.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[208:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_527.md) Or, Soma being a
tree (plant).

<span id="fn_526"></span>[209:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_528.md) This touching takes
place either before or after the invocation of I*d*â (see I, 8, I, I
seq.), whereupon the priests and sacrificer eat their respective
portions; the straight gut being the Agnîdh's, the part above the udder
(adhyndhnî) the Hot*ri*'s, the kloman (apparently the right lung) the
Brahman's, the pericardium (? purîtat) the Adhvaryu's, and the spleen
the sacrificer's share, while the I*d*â is eaten by all of them.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[209:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_529.md) Or perhaps,--And as
to his touching it before this, (he did so) fearing lest those (evil
spirits) that hover near would tear it about; and even if he be not (any
longer?) afraid of its being torn about, let him now touch it in any
case. The Kâ*n*va text has simply,--<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>
This is the time for touching; but if he think, 'Those standing about
here will meddle with it,' he may also touch it before: but this is
certainly the time for touching.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[210:1](sbe2633.htm#fr_530.md) The St. Petersburg
Dictionary suggests that 'nidîdhyat' and 'nidhîta' are probably
corruptions of forms from 'dhâ;' the Taitt. S. (I, 3, 10) having 'ni
dedhyat--vi bobhuvat' instead. Mahîdhara also takes 'nidîdhyat' from
'dhî' in the sense of 'dhâ,'--'Indra's out-breathing is infused into
every limb; Indra's in-breathing has been infused into every limb.' The
Kâ*n*va text has '-nidhîta*h*, -nidîdhe.'

<span id="fn_529"></span>[210:2](sbe2633.htm#fr_531.md) Rather, 'the
mothers (or mother) and fathers.' The Taitt. S. separates mâtâ
pitara*h*, 'the mother and the fathers.'
