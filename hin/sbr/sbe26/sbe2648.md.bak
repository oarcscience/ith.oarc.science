### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:1">4:2:4:1</span></span>1. That
(opening of) vital air of his which is in front, that, forsooth, is the
Vai*s*vânara (graha); and that which is behind is the Dhruva. Formerly,
indeed, both these grahas, the Dhruva and Vai*s*vânara, were drawn; and
even now one of them is still drawn, to wit, the Dhruva <span
id="fr_717"></span>[1](#fn_715.md). And if he acquire a knowledge of that
(Vai*s*vânara graha) either from the Karakas, or from anywhere else, let
him pour it into the sacrificer's cup; but this (Dhruva graha he pours)
into the Hot*ri*'s cup <span id="fr_718"></span>[2](#fn_716.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:2">4:2:4:2</span></span>2. Now,
what part of him there is below the navel, that part of his self, that
vital energy of his, is this (Dhruva): hence he draws it by means of
this (earth), because of her is the bowl (sthâlî) <span
id="fr_719"></span>[3](#fn_717.md), and with a bowl he draws it;--for
undecaying and immortal is this (earth), and undecaying and immortal is
the vital energy: therefore he draws it by means of this (earth).

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:3">4:2:4:3</span></span>3. He
draws it full; for full means all, and the vital energy means all:
therefore he draws it full.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:4">4:2:4:4</span></span>4. He
draws it for (Agni) Vai*s*vânara; for Vai*s*vânara ('he that belongs to
all men') is the year, and the vital energy (life) is the year:
therefore he draws it for Vai*s*vânara.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:5">4:2:4:5</span></span>5. Having
been drawn at the morning pressing, it reposes apart from that time:
thus he guides him (the sacrificer) safely through all the pressings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:6">4:2:4:6</span></span>6. Let
him not pour it (into the Hot*ri*'s cup) during the chanting; for,
verily, were he to pour it out during the chanting, the sacrificer would
not live through the year.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:7">4:2:4:7</span></span>7. He
pours it out during the recitation of the *s*astra; whereby he guides
him safely over the twelvefold chant of praise: thus he obtains ever
continued life, and thus does the sacrificer live long. Therefore the
Brâhman should sit through the praise of Agni (Agnish*t*oma) <span
id="fr_720"></span>[1](#fn_718); till the offering of this (libation.md) he
must not slip away <span id="fr_721"></span>[2](#fn_719.md)--nor must he

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

discharge urine: thus he obtains the full life--for this (libation) is
his life--thus he reaches the full (measure of) life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:8">4:2:4:8</span></span>8. For,
what part of him there is below the navel, that part of his self is this
(Dhruva libation). Hence were he to slip away or discharge urine before
the offering of this (libation), he would discharge the Dhruva (the
firm, constant one): hence, lest he should discharge the Dhruva, he sits
through the praise of Agni. This, indeed, applies only to the
sacrificer <span id="fr_722"></span>[1](#fn_720), for this (libation.md) is
part of the sacrificer's self.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:9">4:2:4:9</span></span>9. He
sits through the praise of Agni <span
id="fr_723"></span>[2](#fn_721.md);--for Soma is glory: hence they both
approach, he who partakes of the Soma and he who does not,--they
approach, forsooth, to behold that glory. And thus indeed the Brahmans,
having crept near together, take unto them that glory, when they drink
(the Soma);--and verily whosoever, knowing this, drinks (Soma), becomes
glorious <span id="fr_724"></span>[3](#fn_722.md) indeed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:10">4:2:4:10</span></span>10.
Now, those same (priests) having, while gliding along <span
id="fr_725"></span>[4](#fn_723.md), deposited that glory in him who sits
through (celebrates) the praise of Agni, they glide along and turn away
from that glory <span id="fr_726"></span>[5](#fn_724.md): having thus
encompassed it, he again takes that glory unto himself;--

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

verily, whosoever, knowing this, sits through (celebrates) the praise of
Agni, he passes away after becoming the most glorious of these (men).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:11">4:2:4:11</span></span>11.
Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, were
contending for this sacrifice--their father Pra*g*âpati, the
year,--saying, 'Ours he shall be! ours he shall be!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:12">4:2:4:12</span></span>12.
Then the gods went on singing praises and toiling. They devised this
Agnish*t*oma feast, and by means of this Agnish*t*oma feast they
appropriated the entire sacrifice and excluded the Asuras from the
sacrifice. And in like manner does this (sacrificer), by means of this
Agnish*t*oma feast, now appropriate the entire sacrifice, and exclude
his enemies from the sacrifice: therefore he celebrates the
Agnish*t*oma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:13">4:2:4:13</span></span>13.
Having drawn it (the Dhruva graha), he deposits it with the northern
cart <span id="fr_727"></span>[1](#fn_725.md), lest he should confound the
vital airs, for the grahas are vital airs: now the other grahas he
deposits on the raised (mound), but this one (he deposits) after pushing
(the dust) aside without leaving as much as a blade of grass
between <span id="fr_728"></span>[2](#fn_726.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:14">4:2:4:14</span></span>14. For
those (other cups of Soma) are that part of his body from the navel
upwards, and above, as it were, is what is from the navel upwards, and
above, as it were, is what is raised: therefore he deposits

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the others) on
the raised (mound), and this one (he deposits) after pushing (the dust)
aside without leaving as much as a blade of grass between.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:15">4:2:4:15</span></span>15. For
this (cup of Soma) is that part of his body from the navel downwards;
and below, as it were, is what is from the navel downwards; and below,
as it were, is what (one deposits) after pushing (the dust) aside and
leaving not so much as a blade of grass between: therefore he deposits
this (Dhruva graha) after pushing (the dust) aside, without leaving so
much as a blade of grass between.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:16">4:2:4:16</span></span>16.
Now, that sacrifice which is being performed is Pra*g*âpati, from whom
these creatures on earth have been born,--and indeed even now they are
born after this (sacrifice). The creatures that are born therefrom after
those (libations) which he deposits on the raised (mound), stand on this
(earth) with something different from their own self,--for those which
stand on hoofs indeed stand on this (earth) with something different
from their own self. And when he deposits this (Dhruva cup) after
shifting aside (the dust), and not leaving so much as a blade of grass
between,--the creatures that are born *th*ereafter from this
(sacrifice), stand on this (earth) with their own self, namely, men and
wild beasts <span id="fr_729"></span>[1](#fn_727.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:17">4:2:4:17</span></span>17.
Moreover, on the one hand, in throwing up (the mound) he puts upon this
(earth) something different from it; and those creatures that are born
from this (sacrifice) after those (libations) which he deposits on the
raised (mound), they stand on this (earth) with something different from
their own self, namely, with hoofs.

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:18">4:2:4:18</span></span>18.
And, on the other hand, they offer in the Âhavanîya <span
id="fr_730"></span>[1](#fn_728.md) a sacrificial cake, parched
barley-grains, porridge, sour curds, and clotted curds,--this is like
pouring (food) into one's mouth. But this (libation) remains apart,
(being) of one form like water. Hence while he eats the multiform food
with that mouth (the fire), he lets flow from that opening the uniform
(libation) like water. Then as to why it is called Dhruva.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:19">4:2:4:19</span></span>19.
Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid
of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. The Asura-Rakshas assailed them
from the south, and overturned those southern cups of Soma,--even that
southern Soma-cart they overturned; but that other (cart) they could not
overturn: the northern cart then kept the southern cart steady <span
id="fr_731"></span>[2](#fn_729.md). And because they could not overturn
that (northern cup) therefore it is called Dhruva (firm) <span
id="fr_732"></span>[3](#fn_730.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:20">4:2:4:20</span></span>20.
They indeed watch over it; for this (cup of Soma) is the head of
Gâyatrî, Gâyatrî being the sacrifice,--there are twelve chants (stotra)
and twelve recitations (*s*astra): that makes twenty-four, and of
twenty-four syllables consists the Gâyatrî. This cup of Soma is her
head; but the head means excellence, for the head indeed means
excellence: hence people say of him who is the best man of a place, that
'so and so is the head of such and such a place.' And, indeed, the best
man would come to harm, if this

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (cup) were to come
to harm; and, the best man being the sacrificer, they watch (this cup)
lest the sacrificer should come to harm.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:21">4:2:4:21</span></span>21.
Moreover, this (graha) is Gâyatrî's calf, Gâyatrî being the
sacrifice,--there are twelve chants and twelve recitations: that makes
twenty-four, and of twenty-four syllables consists the Gâyatrî. This is
her calf;--when they watch it, then they watch these calves for the sake
of the milking: 'as they yield this milk, even so may this Gâyatrî yield
all the sacrificer's wishes,'--this is why they watch it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:22">4:2:4:22</span></span>22. And
when both the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthât*ri* walk out (of the
cart-shed) and (afterwards) enter (again) <span
id="fr_733"></span>[1](#fn_731), it is as if (a cow.md) were to come with
the calf tied to her. They come to this cup of Soma, and he (the
Adhvaryu) pours it out; whereby he lets loose the Gâyatrî: 'Made over to
the sacrificer, may this Gâyatrî yield all his desires!' for this reason
he pours it out.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:23">4:2:4:23</span></span>23. He
pours it (into the Hot*ri*'s cup <span id="fr_734"></span>[1](#fn_731).md)
with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 25), 'The firm Soma I pour out--or, I take--with
firm mind and speech: now may Indra make our people of one mind, free
from enemies!' whereby he means to say, 'so that Indra may make these
our creatures, the people, of one mind and free from enemies, for their
happiness and glory and nourishment!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:4:24">4:2:4:24</span></span>24.
Here now he draws it from that (stream of Soma) <span
id="fr_735"></span>[2](#fn_732), (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 24; Rig-veda VI, 7, 1.md),
'Agni

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vai*s*vânara, the
crest of heaven, the disposer of the earth, born in the sacred rite, the
wise all-ruler, the guest of men,--him the gods have begotten as a
vessel for their mouth. Thou art taken with a support: thou art firm
(Dhruva), of firm abode, the firmest of the firm, the most solidly
founded of the solid! This is thy womb--thee for Vai*s*vânara!'
therewith he deposits it after pushing (the dust) aside, and not leaving
so much as a blade of grass between: for he indeed takes it for (Agni)
Vai*s*vânara.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_715"></span>[298:1](sbe2648.htm#fr_717.md) 'Formerly they took
these two separately, as Dhruva and Vai*s*vânara; but now they take them
as one only.' Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[298:2](sbe2648.htm#fr_718.md) Both these
libations are reserved for the evening feast.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[298:3](sbe2648.htm#fr_719.md) See [p.
288](sbe2645.htm#page_288), note [2](sbe2646.htm#fn_696.md).

<span id="fn_718"></span>[299:1](sbe2648.htm#fr_720.md) ? Tasmâd brâhma*n*o
’gnish*t*omasat syât. The obvious meaning of this sentence is, 'hence
the celebrator of the Agnish*t*oma should be a Brahman,' or, perhaps,
'hence a Brâhman should celebrate the Agnish*t*oma;' but I do not see
how it can have that meaning here, without at least a double-entendre in
the term 'agnish*t*omasad,' Agnish*t*oma in that case ('the praise of
Agni') referring both to the sacrifice generally and to the chanting
(stoma or stotra). See next note. My MS. of Sâya*n*a's commentary (from
the library of the Mahârâ*g*a of Bikaner) has unfortunately an omission
here.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[299:2](sbe2648.htm#fr_721.md) Viz. from the
Sadas; 'ni*h*sarpet,' Kâ*n*va text. The verb sarp, 'to glide or creep,'
is used technically of a peculiar noiseless mode of leaving (ni*h*sarp)
the Sadas and returning thither (prasarp or pratisarp, see [paragraph
10](sbe2648.htm#4:2:4:10).md), and respectfully approaching the dhish*n*ya
fires. If it has to be taken here in that sense, the first prohibition
would seem to refer to the Hot*ri* (cf. Ait. Br. II, 21, where the
question is argued whether or not the Hot*ri* ought to <span
id="page_300">p. 300</span> proceed to the chanting-place with the other
priests, and is decided in the negative); since the sacrificer, to whom
the second prohibition refers (Kâty. IX, 6, 23), goes along with them,
according to [IV, 2, 5, 4](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:4.md). According to the
commentary on Kâty. IX, 6, 33, in performing the sarpa*n*a the priests
and sacrificer should move along sitting at the morning feast; walking
with bent bodies at the midday feast; and walking upright at the evening
feast.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[300:1](sbe2648.htm#fr_722.md) Tad u tad ya;
amânasyaiva. Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[300:2](sbe2648.htm#fr_723.md) Or, he indeed
becomes a celebrator of the Agnish*t*oma.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[300:3](sbe2648.htm#fr_724.md) The Kâ*n*va text
has 'ya*s*asvî.'

<span id="fn_723"></span>[300:4](sbe2648.htm#fr_725.md) See [p.
99](sbe2617.htm#page_99), note [2](sbe2617.htm#fn_261.md).

<span id="fn_724"></span>[300:5](sbe2648.htm#fr_726.md) The Kâ*n*va MS.
(W.) reads, 'agnish*t*omasad etad yása*h* sannidhâyata <span
id="page_301">p. 301</span> etasmât parâ*ñk*o ya*s*áso (sic) bhavanti'
('they turn away from that glorious one').

<span id="fn_725"></span>[301:1](sbe2648.htm#fr_727.md) The dhruva-sthâlî
is placed just in front of the northern prop.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[301:2](sbe2648.htm#fr_728.md) Lit. not putting a
blade of grass between (the sthâlî and the ground on which it stands).
Cf. Kâty. IX, 2, 18. Apparently he is to shift the sthâlî along the
ground from the khara to the place where it is to stand, all grass and
other objects being thus removed between this vessel and those standing
on the mound ('vyuhyaita*m* na t*rin*a*m* *k*anântardhâya,' Kâ*n*va
text).

<span id="fn_727"></span>[302:1](sbe2648.htm#fr_729.md) *S*vâpada, lit.
'dog-footed' beasts.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[303:1](sbe2648.htm#fr_730.md) See [IV, 2, 5,
15](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:15.md) seq.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[303:2](sbe2648.htm#fr_731) 'They (the gods.md)
then made the southern cart firm from (or by means of) the northern
cart.' Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[303:3](sbe2648.htm#fr_732.md) It is more probable
that the Dhruva (firm, constant) derives its name from the fact that it
remains intact till the very end of the Agnish*t*oma, as suggested in
the Petersburg Dictionary.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[304:1](sbe2648.htm#fr_734.md) Viz. at the evening
feast, when the Adhvaryu pours the Soma from the Dhruva-sthâlî into the
Hot*ri*'s cup ([paragraph 23](sbe2648.htm#4:2:4:23).md).

<span id="fn_732"></span>[304:2](sbe2648.htm#fr_735.md) See [p.
256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note [1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619.md). The preceding
paragraphs anticipate the future rites regarding this libation, the
original drawing of which is only now described.
