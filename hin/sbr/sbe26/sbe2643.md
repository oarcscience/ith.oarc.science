### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:4:1">4:1:4:1</span></span>1. Mitra
and Varu*n*a, forsooth, are his intelligence and will; and as such
belonging to his self: whenever he desires anything in his mind, as
'Would that this were mine! I might do this!' that is intelligence; and
whenever that is accomplished, that is will <span
id="fr_650"></span>[4](#fn_648.md). Now intelligence indeed is Mitra, and
will is

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Varu*n*a; and
Mitra is the priesthood, and Varu*n*a the nobility; and the priesthood
is the conceiver, and the noble is the doer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:4:2">4:1:4:2</span></span>2. Now in
the beginning these two, the priesthood and the nobility, were separate:
then Mitra, the priesthood, could stand without Varu*n*a, the nobility.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:4:3">4:1:4:3</span></span>3. Not
Varu*n*a, the nobility, without Mitra, the priesthood: whatever deed
Varu*n*a did unsped by Mitra, the priesthood, therein, forsooth, he
succeeded not.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:4:4">4:1:4:4</span></span>4.
Varu*n*a, the nobility, then called upon Mitra, the priesthood, saying,
'Turn thou unto me that we may unite: I will place thee foremost, sped
by thee, I will do deeds!'--'So be it!' So the two united; and therefrom
resulted that graha to Mitra and Varu*n*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:4:5">4:1:4:5</span></span>5. Such,
then, is the office of Purohita (placed foremost, domestic priest).
Wherefore let not a Brâhman desire to become the Purohita of any one
Kshatriya (he may meet with), as thereby righteousness and
unrighteousness unite; nor should a Kshatriya make any Brâhman (he may
meet with) his Purohita, as thereby righteousness and unrighteousness
unite.--Whatever deed, sped by Mitra, the priesthood, Varu*n*a
thenceforward did, in that he succeeded.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:4:6">4:1:4:6</span></span>6. Hence
it is quite proper that a Brâhman should be without a king, but were he
to obtain a king, it would be conducive to the success (of both). It is,
however, quite improper that a king should be without a Brâhman, for
whatever deed he does, unsped by Mitra, the priesthood, therein he
succeeds not. Wherefore a Kshatriya who intends to do a deed ought by
all means to resort to a Brâhman, for

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

he verily succeeds only in the deed sped by the Brâhman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:4:7">4:1:4:7</span></span>7. Now he
draws (the Maitrâ-varu*n*a graha) from that (stream of Soma) <span
id="fr_651"></span>[1](#fn_649.md), with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 9; Rig-veda II,
41, 4), 'This Soma, O Mitra and Varu*n*a, hath been pressed for you; ye
holy, now hear my cry!--Thou art taken with a support <span
id="fr_652"></span>[2](#fn_650.md)!--Thee for Mitra and Varu*n*a!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:4:8">4:1:4:8</span></span>8. He
mixes it with milk. The reason why he mixes it with milk is this. Soma,
forsooth, was V*ri*tra. Now when the gods slew him, they said to Mitra,
'Thou also slayest!' But he liked it not and said, 'Surely, I am every
one's friend (mitra): being no friend, I shall become an enemy (or,
other than Mitra, Amitra).'--'Then we shall exclude thee from the
sacrifice!'--Then said he, 'I, too, slay!' Thereupon the cattle went
from him, saying, 'Being a friend, he has become an enemy!' Thus he was
deprived of the cattle. By mixing (the Soma) with milk, the gods then
supplied him with cattle; and in like manner does this (priest) now
supply him (the sacrificer or Mitra) with cattle by mixing (the Soma)
with milk.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:4:9">4:1:4:9</span></span>9. As to
this they say, 'Surely he liked it not to slay!' Thus, what milk there
is in this (mixture) that belongs to Mitra, but the Soma belongs to
Varu*n*a: therefore one mixes it with milk.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:4:10">4:1:4:10</span></span>10. He
mixes it with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 10; Rig-veda IV, 42, 10), 'May we delight
in the wealth we have gained, the gods in the offering, the kine in
pasture! that unfailing milch cow,

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> O Mitra and
Varu*n*a, grant ye unto us day by day!'--with 'This is thy womb: thee
for truth and life <span id="fr_653"></span>[1](#fn_651.md)!' he deposits
it. Now as to why he says, 'Thee for truth and life,'--the truth is
Mitra <span id="fr_654"></span>[2](#fn_652.md), since Mitra is the Brahman,
and the truth is the Brahman (sacerdotium or sacred writ);--and life is
Varu*n*a, since Varu*n*a is the year, and life is the year: therefore he
says, 'This is thy womb: thee for truth and life!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_645"></span>[269:1](sbe2642.htm#fr_647.md) When the cup is
half-filled he withdraws it for a moment from the stream of Soma flowing
from the Hot*ri*'s cup into the Dro*n*akala*s*a trough; after which he
again holds it under to have it filled completely. For the shape of this
cup, see [IV, I, 5, 19](sbe2644.htm#4:1:5:19.md).

<span id="fn_646"></span>[269:2](sbe2642.htm#fr_648.md) See [IV, 1, 2,
6](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:6.md), with note.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[269:3](sbe2642.htm#fr_649.md) See [IV, 1, 2,
9](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:9.md) with note.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[269:4](sbe2643.htm#fr_650.md) The Kâ*n*va text
adds, tad asyaitâv âtmana*h*, 'and these two are of his self,' which
seems to be intended to explain the preceding adhyâtmam, 'belonging to
his self.' See [IV, 1, 3, 1](sbe2642.htm#4:1:3:1.md), with note.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[271:1](sbe2643.htm#fr_651.md) See [p.
256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note [1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619.md). For the shape
of this cup, see [IV, 1, 5, 19](sbe2644.htm#4:1:5:19.md).

<span id="fn_650"></span>[271:2](sbe2643.htm#fr_652.md) See [IV, 1, 2,
6](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:6.md), and note.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[272:1](sbe2643.htm#fr_653.md) This is a false
analysis of *ri*tâyu, 'righteous, holy.'

<span id="fn_652"></span>[272:2](sbe2643.htm#fr_654.md) The text has
'Brahman,' which must be wrong. The Kâ*n*va recension has, correctly,
mitro vâ *ri*tam, brahma hi mitro, brahma hy *ri*tam.
