Now when at that Trir&acirc;tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_969"></A><A HREF="#fn_963"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> sacrifice he gives those thousand (cows), then that one is made the one-thousandth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_970"></A><A HREF="#fn_964"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. On the first day he brings three hundred and thirty-three; and likewise on the second day he brings three hundred and thirty-three; and likewise on the third day he brings three hundred and thirty-three.

Or he may lead her up on the last day; then her progeny precedes her, and she herself walks behind. This, however, is mere speculation: let him lead her up on the last day,--her progeny precedes her, and she herself walks behind.</p>

If, not urged by any man, she goes eastwards, then let him know that this sacrificer has succeeded, that he has won the happy world. If she goes northwards, let him know that the sacrificer will be more glorious in this world. If she goes westwards, let him know that he will be rich in dependants and crops. If she goes southwards, let him know that the sacrificer will quickly depart from this world. Such are the ways of knowledge.</p>

Or let him appoint two Unnet<I>ri</I>s, and let him give her to him, of the two, who does not call for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>; for defective, indeed, is he who, being an officiating priest, does not call for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>; and defective also is the Vir&acirc;<I>g</I> which is pulled asunder: thus he puts the defective to the defective.</p>

Now they say, one ought not to give anything above a thousand (cows), because by a thousand he obtains all the objects of his desire. But &Acirc;suri said, 'Let him give according to his wish: by a thousand he indeed obtains all his wishes; and anything else (that he gives) is likewise given at his wish&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_974"></A><A HREF="#fn_968"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:8:16">4:5:8:16</A></FONT></span>16. In bringing the dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;s, let him bring complete decads. If he intends to give one (cow) to any (priest), let him pass over a decad to ten such (priests). If he intends to give two to any one, let him pass over a decad to five such (priests). If he intends to give three to any one, let him pass over a decad to three such&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_975"></A><A HREF="#fn_969"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. If he intends to give five to</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_963"></A><A HREF="sbe2667.htm#fr_969">414:1</A> The Sahasradakshi<I>n</I>a Trir&acirc;tra, or sacrifice of three (pressing) days, with a thousand cows as the priests&#8217; fee, is mentioned K&acirc;ty. XIII, 4, 35 seq. as, apparently, an independent Ah&icirc;na sacrifice. I do not, however, know whether it might not be added on to some other sacrificial performance, as, for instance, to the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya sha<I>d</I>aha, thus forming together with this the Navar&acirc;tra (or first nine days of the Da<I>s</I>ar&acirc;tra, see <A HREF="sbe2662.htm#page_402">p. 402</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2663.htm#fn_935">2</A>). K&acirc;ty. gives no indication as to the particular forms of Soma-sacrifice required for the several days; but, guided no doubt by the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, he confines his remarks to the manner of distribution of the dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;s.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_964"></A><A HREF="sbe2667.htm#fr_970">414:2</A> S&acirc;hasr&icirc;, lit. 'she who makes the dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc; to consist of one thousand.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_965"></A><A HREF="sbe2667.htm#fr_971">414:3</A> Or,--and from her, V&acirc;<I>k</I>, those thousand (cows) were produced; <A NAME="page_415"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 415</FONT></A> or,--and from her (the thousandth cow) that thousandfold progeny of V&acirc;<I>k</I> was produced; see <a href="sbe2676.htm#4:6:7:3">IV, 6, 7, 3</A>, where the thousandfold progeny of V&acirc;<I>k</I> is identified with the Vedic texts generally.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_966"></A><A HREF="sbe2667.htm#fr_972">416:1</A> I am not certain whether I understand this passage rightly. According to <a href="sbe2667.htm#4:5:8:16">paragraph 16</A>, and K&acirc;ty. XIII, 4, 23, he is to give away the cows by tens. This would leave three each day, or nine on the three days. To them he is to add the S&acirc;hasr&icirc;, and give the ten cows to the Hot<I>ri</I>.--A common Vir&acirc;<I>g</I> verse consists of three times ten syllables; but there are also such as consist of three times eleven syllables. These latter the sacrificer is thus represented (by withholding three cows out of thirty-three) to make into a proper Vir&acirc;<I>g</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_967"></A><A HREF="sbe2667.htm#fr_973">416:2</A> That is, according to the St. Petersb. Dict., he possesses a <A NAME="page_417"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 417</FONT></A> thousand verses;--if it does not rather refer to the extent of the Rig-veda, consisting of rather more than a thousand (1028) hymns. Cp. also 'the thousandfold progeny of V&acirc;<I>k</I>,' <A HREF="#page_414">p. 414</A>, note <A HREF="#fn_965">3</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_968"></A><A HREF="sbe2667.htm#fr_974">417:1</A> The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text has much the same reasoning, but does not ascribe it to any one.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_969"></A><A HREF="sbe2667.htm#fr_975">417:2</A> In this and all other cases the text has 'to those three (ten &amp;c.).' It is not clear in what manner he is to divide the ten cows between the three priests, unless indeed he is to repeat the same process three times, giving the odd cow each time to another priest. The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text only mentions two of the cases here given, viz. that if he intends to give one cow to each (ekaik&acirc;m), <A NAME="page_418"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 418</FONT></A> he is to give ten to ten such; and if he intends to give two to each, he is to give ten to five such. Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 52, remarks that this paragraph is not clear to him, and suggests that it may be interpolated. It does not appear, what the exact proportion of the thousand cows is for each of the sixteen priests; but we may assume that it did not differ much from that given at the Agnish<I>t</I>oma (see <A HREF="sbe2653.htm#page_345">p. 345</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2653.htm#fn_810">1</A>), and that this result was brought about by repeated distributions among varied groupings of the priests.</P>
