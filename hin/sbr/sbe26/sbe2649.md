### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:1">4:2:5:1</span></span>1. Having
drawn the cups of Soma, and gone out (of the cart-shed to the high
altar) <span id="fr_736"></span>[1](#fn_733), he offers the oblation of
drops <span id="fr_737"></span>[2](#fn_734). The reason why he offers
the oblation of drops is this. Whatever drops of that (Soma) are spilt
here, to them he now wishes a safe journey to the Âhavanîya, for the
Âhavanîya is the resting-place of offerings: this is why he offers the
oblation of drops.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:2">4:2:5:2</span></span>2. He
offers with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 26; Rig-veda X, 17, 12), 'Whatever drop of
thine leapeth

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

away, whatever stalk of thine,'--whatever particle (of Soma) is spilt,
that is a drop, that indeed he means; and by 'whatever stalk of thine'
he mentions the stalk;--'stone-pressed, from the lap of the
press-bowls;' for pressed by the stone <span
id="fr_738"></span>[1](#fn_735) it leaps away from the two
press-bowls;--'be it from the Adhvaryu or from the strainer,'--for it
leaps away either from the Adhvaryu's hands or from the strainer,--'that
I offer unto thee in my mind consecrated by Vasha*t*, Hail!' whereby it
becomes for him as an offering consecrated by Vasha*t*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:3">4:2:5:3</span></span>3.
Thereupon the Adhvaryu takes two stalks of grass from the covered altar.
The two Adhvaryus <span id="fr_739"></span>[2](#fn_736) proceed first
(to the chanting-place beside the pit), as the out-breathing and
in-breathing of the sacrifice; then the Prastot*ri*, as the voice of the
sacrifice; then the Udgât*ri*, as the self (or body), the Pra*g*âpati,
of the sacrifice; then the Pratihart*ri*, either as the physician or the
through-breathing <span id="fr_740"></span>[3](#fn_737).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:4">4:2:5:4</span></span>4. The
Sacrificer holds on to those five priests from behind <span
id="fr_741"></span>[4](#fn_738), for as much as those five priests are,
so much is the whole sacrifice, the sacrifice being fivefold: hence the
Sacrificer thereby holds on to the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:5">4:2:5:5</span></span>5. He
(the Adhvaryu) then throws one of the two

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

stalks of grass forward towards the pit <span
id="fr_742"></span>[1](#fn_739), with, 'Thou art the ascent of the
gods!' for when the gods through the sacrifice attained to the heavenly
world, it was from that pit that they went upwards to the heavenly
world: he thus makes the sacrificer look along the road to heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:6">4:2:5:6</span></span>6. He
then throws down the other stalk in front of the chanters, silently, for
those chanters represent the hymn of praise (stotra), Pra*g*âpati (the
sacrifice),--he (Pra*g*âpati) draws to himself everything here, and
takes possession of everything here: it is to him that that stalk is
offered, and thus he does not draw the Adhvaryu to himself, and take
possession of him. And when they mutter <span
id="fr_743"></span>[2](#fn_740),--for the chanters mutter now <span
id="fr_744"></span>[3](#fn_741),--

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:7">4:2:5:7</span></span>7. Then
he bespeaks the chant, saying, 'Soma becometh pure!' He bespeaks the
chant right off <span id="fr_745"></span>[4](#fn_742), and they chant
right off; for these chants, the Pavamânâ*h* <span
id="fr_746"></span>[5](#fn_743), are directed towards the gods, since

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

the gods thereby attained to the heavenly world right off (straightway):
therefore he bespeaks the chant right off, and right off they chant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:8">4:2:5:8</span></span>8. With
'Turn ye back <span id="fr_747"></span>[1](#fn_744)!' (he bespeaks) the
other chants (viz. the Dhuryas), and turning back (or repeating) they
chant the Dhuryas <span id="fr_748"></span>[2](#fn_745), for the latter

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

are directed towards these creatures: whence creatures are produced here
repeatedly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:9">4:2:5:9</span></span>9. And as
to why they chant the Bahishpavamâna here (near the *k*âtvâla). In the
beginning, forsooth, yonder sun was here on earth <span
id="fr_749"></span>[1](#fn_746). The seasons embraced him and ascended
from hence to the heavenly world: there he burns firmly established

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

in the seasons. And in like manner do the priests thereby embrace the
sacrificer and ascend from hence to the heavenly world: this is why they
chant the Bahishpavamâna h ere.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:10">4:2:5:10</span></span>10. The
Bahishpavamâna <span id="fr_750"></span>[1](#fn_747) chant truly is a
ship

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

bound heavenwards: the priests are its spars and oars, the means of
reaching the heavenly world. If there be a blameworthy one, even that
one (priest) would make it sink: he makes it sink, even as one who
ascends a ship that is full would make it sink. And, indeed, every
sacrifice is a ship bound heavenwards: hence one should seek to keep a
blameworthy (priest) away from every sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:11">4:2:5:11</span></span>11.
Thereupon, when the chanting is over <span
id="fr_751"></span>[1](#fn_748), he

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

utters this speech,--'Agnîdh, spread the fires! strew the barhis!
Prepare the cakes! go on with the victim!' The Agnîdh spreads the fires,
that is to say, kindles them <span id="fr_752"></span>[1](#fn_749); he
strews that barhis <span id="fr_753"></span>[2](#fn_750), thinking,
'When the barhis is strewn, I will offer to the gods on the kindled
(fire).'--'Prepare the cakes,' he says, because he is about to proceed
with the cakes; and, 'Go on with the victim,' because he is about to get
ready the victim <span id="fr_754"></span>[3](#fn_751).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:12">4:2:5:12</span></span>12.
Having again entered (the cart-shed) he draws the Â*s*vina graha <span
id="fr_755"></span>[4](#fn_752). Having drawn the Â*s*vina graha he goes
out and girds the sacrificial stake <span
id="fr_756"></span>[5](#fn_753); and having girt the stake he gets ready
the victim: he thereby puts flavour (juice) into him (Soma--the
sacrificer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:13">4:2:5:13</span></span>13.
Having been slain at the morning feast, it continues being cooked till
the evening feast; whereby he puts flavour (juice) into the whole
sacrifice, imbues it with flavour.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:14">4:2:5:14</span></span>14. Let
him therefore, at the Agnish*t*oma, slay a (victim) sacred to Agni, for
there is harmony when, at the Agnish*t*oma, he slays a (victim) for
Agni. If

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

it be an Ukthya sacrifice, let him slay one to Indra and Agni in the
second place, for songs of praise (uktha) <span
id="fr_757"></span>[1](#fn_754) refer to Indra and Agni. If it be a
Sho*d*a*s*in sacrifice, let him slay one to Indra in the third place,
for the sixteenfold chant (sho*d*a*s*in) <span
id="fr_758"></span>[2](#fn_755) means Indra. If it be an Atirâtra, let
him slay one to Sarasvatî in the fourth place, for Sarasvatî is speech,
and speech (vâ*k*, fem.) is female, as the night (râtri, fem.) is
female: he thus duly distinguishes the forms of sacrifice <span
id="fr_759"></span>[3](#fn_756).

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:15">4:2:5:15</span></span>15.
Thereupon he proceeds with (the offering of) the cakes of the Soma
feast. Now Soma is a god, for Soma was in the heaven;--'Soma, forsooth,
was V*ri*tra; the mountains and stones are his body: thereon grows that
plant called U*s*ânâ,' said *S*vetaketu Auddâlaki; that they bring
hither and press.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:16">4:2:5:16</span></span>16. Now
when he slays the victim, he thereby puts flavour into it; and when he
proceeds with (the offering of) the Soma feast cakes, he puts sap into
it: thus it becomes Soma for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:17">4:2:5:17</span></span>17.
They all belong to Indra; for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: that
is why they all belong to Indra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:18">4:2:5:18</span></span>18. And
as to why there are a cake, parched barley-grain, a porridge, sour
curds, and clotted curds,--it is that those who are the deities of the
sacrifice shall be well-pleased.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:19">4:2:5:19</span></span>19.
For, when one has eaten cake here, he wishes, 'I should like to take
parched grains, I should like to eat porridge, I should like to eat sour
curds, I should like to eat clotted curds!' All these (are Objects of
one's) wishes: it is in order that those who are the deities of the
sacrifice shall be well-pleased. Now as to why that offering of clotted
curds (payasyâ) is prepared only at the morning libation, and not at the
two other libations (Soma feasts).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:20">4:2:5:20</span></span>20. The
Gâyatrî, forsooth, bears the morning libation (to the gods), the
Trish*t*ubh the midday libation, and the *G*agatî the evening
libation,--but, then, the Trish*t*ubh bears the midday libation, not
alone, (but) with both the Gâyatrî and the B*ri*hatî <span
id="fr_760"></span>[1](#fn_757); and the *G*agatî (bears) the evening
libation, not alone,

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (but) with the
Gâyatrî, the Kakubh, and Ush*n*ih, and the Anush*t*ubh <span
id="fr_761"></span>[1](#fn_758).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:21">4:2:5:21</span></span>21. The
Gâyatrî alone bears singly the morning libation,--with those two sets of
five (paṅkti) <span id="fr_762"></span>[2](#fn_759), the set of five
chants, and the set of five oblations: there are four Â*g*ya
(chants) <span id="fr_763"></span>[3](#fn_760) and the Bahishpavamâna is
the fifth,--the Paṅkti metre is five-footed with that paṅkti of chants,
not alone, the Gâyatrî bears the morning libation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:5:22">4:2:5:22</span></span>22. To
Indra belongs the cake, to the two bay steeds the parched grains
(dhânâ*h*) <span id="fr_764"></span>[4](#fn_761), to Pûshan the porridge
(karambha), to Sarasvatî the sour curds (dadhi), and to Mitra and
Varu*n*a the clotted curds (payasyâ) <span
id="fr_765"></span>[5](#fn_762),--the Paṅkti is five-footed--with that
paṅkti of oblations, not alone, the Gâyatrî bears the

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

morning libation (to the gods): for the sake of completing that paṅkti,
that oblation of clotted curds to Mitra and Varu*n*a is prepared only at
the morning libation, and not at the two other libations.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_733"></span>[305:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_736) The libations
(grahas) having been taken, and the remaining Nigrâbhyâ water, mixed
with Soma-juice, poured from the Hot*ri*'s cup into the Dro*n*akala*s*a
([p. 256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note [1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619)), the
Adhvaryu, Pratiprasthât*ri*; Prastot*ri*, Udgât*ri*, Pratihart*ri*, and
Sacrificer walk out of the Havirdhâna shed, each following one touching
the hem of the garment of the one before him, and betake themselves to
the altar.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[305:2](sbe2649.htm#fr_737) The vipru*d*-homa,
an expiatory oblation for the Soma spilt during the pressing, consists
of a pra*k*aranî spoon full of ghee. According to Â*s*v. V, 2, 6, and
Lâ*t*y. I, 11, 9, it would seem that each of those taking part in the
Sarpa*n*a (see [p. 299](sbe2648.htm#page_299), note
[2](sbe2648.htm#fn_719)) makes two oblations (called 'prav*ri*tta-homa'
by Lâ*t*y. Sr. and Pa*ñk*avi*ms*a Br.).

<span id="fn_735"></span>[306:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_738) 'Grâva-*k*yuta'
seems to be taken by the author in the sense of set in motion by the
(pressing) stone.' The Rig-veda reads 'bâhu-*k*yuta;' also
'dhisha*n*âyâ*h*' instead of 'dhisha*n*ayo*h*.'

<span id="fn_736"></span>[306:2](sbe2649.htm#fr_739) That is, the
Adhvaryu and his assistant, the Pratiprasthât*ri*.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[306:3](sbe2649.htm#fr_740) Ait. Br. II, 20
enumerates Adhvaryu, Prastot*ri*; Pratihart*ri*; Udgât*ri*, and Brahman
(see also Â*s*v. V, 2, 4-5); the Lâ*t*yây. Sûtra I, 11, Adhvaryu,
Prastot*ri*, Udgât*ri*; Pratihart*ri*, Brahman, and Sacrificer.

<span id="fn_738"></span>[306:4](sbe2649.htm#fr_741) That is, each holds
on to the hem of the garment of the one who precedes him.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[307:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_742) The Udgât*ri*s
(chanters) also throw stalks of grass to the south with their left
hands, with the text, Pa*ñk*av. I, 3, 3.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[307:2](sbe2649.htm#fr_743) And when he thinks
'they have muttered' (atha yadâ manyate ’*g*âpishur iti)--for the
chanters mutter now. Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_741"></span>[307:3](sbe2649.htm#fr_744) For the mantras the
Udgât*ri*s have to mutter on this occasion, previous to the chanting,
see Tâ*nd*ya Br. I, 3, 4-6. The recitation of the Â*g*ya*s*astra, by the
Hot*ri*, succeeding the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna-stotra, is
likewise preceded by a prayer muttered by that priest, for which see
Ait. Br. II, 38; Â*s*v. V, 9.

<span id="fn_742"></span>[307:4](sbe2649.htm#fr_745) That is, without
repeating that formula, in the same way as the Pavamâna chants are
performed without repeating single verses. See [p. 308](#page_308), note
[2](#fn_745).

<span id="fn_743"></span>[307:5](sbe2649.htm#fr_746) The first stotra at
each pressing is called pavamâna (purifying, i.e. during the chanting of
which the Soma becomes clarified), viz. the Bahishpavamâna at the
morning, the Mâdhyandina pavamâna at the midday, and the Ârbhava (or
t*ri*tîya) pavamâna at the evening pressing. The other stotras are
called Dhurya, 'to be harnessed, belonging to or forming a team.' For
the correspondence between the stotra and *s*astra, see [p.
325](sbe2650.htm#page_325), note [2](sbe2651.htm#fn_774).

<span id="fn_744"></span>[308:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_747) This is Sâya*n*a's
interpretation of 'upâvartadhvam,' instead of 'draw near,' as translated
by me at I, 5, 2, 12. He is probably right in connecting it with the
repetitions which certain verses have to undergo in the dhurya-stotras.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[308:2](sbe2649.htm#fr_748) There are many
different stomas, or forms of chanting stotras, named from the number of
verses produced in each form (generally by repetitions of certain
verses). Those required for the Sha*d*aha and Dvâda*s*âha (see IV, 5, 4,
1 seq.) are: triv*ri*t (9), pa*ñk*ada*s*a (15), saptada*s*a 07),
ekavi*ms*a (21), tri*n*ava (27), trayastri*ms*a (33), *k*aturvi*ms*a
(24), *k*atu*sk*atvâri*ms*a (44), and ashta*k*atvâri*ms*a (48). The
first four of these are those most frequently used, and the only ones
used at the Agnish*t*oma. All these stomas, with one exception (24),
have two or more different varieties or arrangements, called vish*t*uti,
differing from one another either in the order in which the several
verses are to be chanted, or in regard to the number of repetitions
which the corresponding verses have to undergo. Besides, stomas are
generally performed in three turns or rounds, paryâya, consisting of a
triplet of verses (some of which may have to be repeated more than
once), and preceded by the sound 'hu*m*' (Hiṅkâra). Thus the first
Â*g*yastotra, Sâmav. II, 10-12, (consisting of three verses, a, b, c,)
is to be performed in the pa*ñk*ada*s*a-stoma; that is, the three verses
have to be so treated, by repetitions, as to produce fifteen verses in
three turns. Now, as there are three different varieties of performing
the pa*ñk*ada*s*a-stoma, the stotra might be chanted in one or other of
the following three arrangements:--

The three paryâyas of a stoma (or vish*t*uti) show each three
subdivisions (viz. a a a--b--c. being those of the first paryâya above),
called vish*t*âva. When the Udgât*ri*s are about to commence a chant,
the Prastot*ri* spreads in their midst a cloth, doubled up so that the
unwoven fringe lies over the selvage, either towards the east or north.
Thereon he marks the subdivisions of the rounds, by means of sticks
(ku*s*â), a span long, of some kind of wood suitable for sacrifice,
split lengthways along the pith (the bark being left outside) and
somewhat pointed at one end, then smeared over with some fragrant
substance, and wrapped up singly in pieces of the same kind of cloth as
that spread on the ground. The marking of the vish*t*âvas, or
subdivisions, takes place at the end of the prastâva or prelude (see
next page, note [1](#fn_747)) in this way, that each vish*t*âva is
marked by as many sticks as the corresponding verse has to be repeated;
those of the first vish*t*âva being laid down with the point to the
north, then behind or west of them those of the second turn with the
point to the west, and behind them those of the third turn with the
point to the north. Thereupon those of the other two rounds are laid
down in the same way, each turn north of the preceding one. Hence the
arrangement of sticks for the first of the above varieties of the
pa*ñk*ada*s*a-stoma would be three straight, one across, one straight;
one straight, three across, one straight; one straight, one across,
three straight.

With the exception of the Bahishpavamâna, the chanting is performed in
the Sadas by the side of the Udumbara post (see [III, 6, 1,
2](sbe2623.htm#3:6:1:2) seq.), the latter being likewise enclosed in a
cloth of the above description, wrapt round it from left to right, with
the unwoven fringe towards the top.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[309:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_749) Cf. Tâ*nd*ya Br.
VI, 7, 24.

<span id="fn_747"></span>[310:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_750) The
Bahishpavamâna-(stotra), or 'outside-pavamâna,'--so called because (on
the first day of a Soma-sacrifice) it is performed outside the altar
(commentary on Pa*ñk*av. Br. VI, 8, 10-11; or outside the Sadas, Sây. on
Sâmav. S. p. 47),--is chanted in the Triv*ri*t, or threefold, stoma;
consisting, as it does, of three gâyatrî triplets (Sâmav. II, 1-9 for
the Agnish*t*oma), and none of its verses being chanted more than once.
This stoma has three different varieties, viz. the udyatî, or ascending
mode, the first turn of which consists of the first verses of the three
triplets, the second turn of the second verses, and the third turn of
the last verses, hence
a<sup>1</sup> a<sup>2</sup> a<sup>3</sup>--b<sup>1</sup> b<sup>2</sup> b<sup>3</sup>--c<sup>1</sup> c<sup>2</sup> c<sup>3</sup>;
the parivartinî, or reverting mode, following the natural order,
a<sup>1</sup> b<sup>1</sup> c<sup>1</sup>--a<sup>2</sup> b<sup>2</sup> c<sup>2</sup>--a<sup>3</sup> b<sup>3</sup> c<sup>3</sup>;
and the kulâyinî, or web-like mode, performed in the order
a<sup>1</sup> b<sup>1</sup> c<sup>1</sup>-b<sup>2</sup> c<sup>2</sup> a<sup>2</sup>--c<sup>3</sup> a<sup>3</sup> b<sup>3</sup>.
Cf. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 237, where, however, these forms are
described quite differently. The term used for the natural order of
verses in the parivartinî vish*t*uti is 'parâ*k*î,' i.e. thitherwards,
straight off. From the statement in [paragraph 7](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:7)
above, that 'they chant straight off (parâk),' one might therefore infer
that that particular mode of chanting ought to be used for the
Bahishpavamâna-stotra; but the term 'parâk' may also be taken as
referring to each of the several verses being chanted 'straight off,'
without any repetition. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 120 note, remarks:
'Each of these verses is for the purpose of chanting divided into four
parts: *Prastâva*, i, e. prelude, the first being preceded by *hum̃*, to
be sung by the Prastotar; *Udgîtha*, the principal part of the Sâman,
preceded by *Om*, to be chanted by the Udgâtar; the *Pratihâra*, i.e.
response \[? rather check, stop; cf. [IV, 3, 4,
22](sbe2653.htm#4:3:4:22)\], introduced by *hum̃*, to be chanted by the
Pratihartar; and the *Nidhana*, i.e. finale, to be sung by all three. To
give the student an idea of this division, I here subjoin the second of
these *rik*as in the Sâman form, distinguishing its four parts:--

\[The connected *rik* form is: Abhi te madhunâ payo--atharvâ*n*o
a*s*i*s*rayur--deva*m* devâya devayu.\]

'*Prastâva:* abhi te madhunâ payo*m*.

'*Udgîtha:* om âtharvâ*n*o a*s*i*s*râdeyurva*m* devâyadâ. <span
id="page_311">p. 311</span>

'*Pratihâra:* hu*m* âvâyo.

'*Nidhana:* sâm.

The Nidhanas, i.e. finales, are for the nine Pavamâna-stotra verses the
following ones: sât, sâm, suvâ*h*, i*d*â, vâk, and â (for the four last
verses).' See also Burnell, Ârsheyabr. p. xlv seq.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[311:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_751) Lâ*t*y. I, 12; II,
1; Tâ*nd*ya Br. VI, 7 seq. give the following details: The Prastot*ri*
takes the prastara (bunch of grass, representing the Sacrificer) from
the Adhvaryu and says, 'Brahman, we will chant, O Pra*s*âstar!' The
Brahman and Maitrâvaru*n*a having given their assent (Â*s*v. V, 2,
12-14). the Prastot*ri* hands the prastara to the Udgât*ri*. The latter
touches his right thigh with it (or bends his right knee thereon) and
'harnesses' (introduces) the chant by the formula, 'with Agni's fire,
with Indra's might, with Sûrya's brilliance, may B*ri*haspati harness
thee,' &c. (Tâ*nd*ya Br. I, 3, 5); whereupon he mutters, 'I will make
food,' &c. (ib. 6); and after looking towards the pit and a vessel of
water and the sun. he commences the chant. The three chanters are seated
west of the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthât*ri* (who look towards them), viz.
the Udgât*ri* facing the north, the Prastot*ri* the west, and the
Pratihart*ri* the south (or south-east). To the west of them are seated
three, four, or six subordinate singers, or choristers (upagât*ri*), who
accompany the chanting in a deep voice with the sound 'Ho.' When the
chant is completed, the Udgât*ri* says, 'I have made food,' and makes
the sacrificer mutter the formula, 'Thou art a falcon,' &c. (Pa*ñk*. Br.
I, 3, 8); whereupon he takes a stalk of grass from the prastara, cuts
off the top and bottom, so as to make it of the length of four thumbs’
breadths, and throws it into the pit with, 'If it has been chanted,' &c.
(ib. II, 1, 8). They then pour out the vessel of water into the pit,
with, 'I send you to the sea,' &c., and make 3, 5, 7 or 9 steps
northwards outside the altar, <span id="page_312">p. 312</span>
whereupon they betake themselves to the Âgnîdhrîya. During the chanting,
the Unnet*ri* pours the Soma-juice from the Âdhavanîya trough through
the strainer into the Pûtabh*ri*t.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[312:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_752) The Agnîdh takes
burning coals from the Âgnîdhrîya fire, and puts them on the dhish*n*ya
hearths, in the order in which they were raised. See [p.
148](sbe2623.htm#page_148), note [4](sbe2624.htm#fn_392).

<span id="fn_750"></span>[312:2](sbe2649.htm#fr_753) He spreads a layer
of (ulapa) grass along the 'spine' (the line from the middle of the back
to the middle of the front side) of the altar.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[312:4](sbe2649.htm#fr_755) Having taken this
cup of Soma or libation (with the formula, Vâ*g*. S. VII, 11) from the
Dro*n*a-kala*s*a or the Pûtabh*ri*t, he makes the sacrificer eye the
several cups and Soma vessels, as set forth [IV, 5, 6,
1](sbe2665.htm#4:5:6:1) seq.; the Â*s*vina being looked at sixth in
order (or fourth of the grahas), not tenth (as was its order of
drawing). See [IV, 1, 5, 16](sbe2644.htm#4:1:5:16).

<span id="fn_753"></span>[312:5](sbe2649.htm#fr_756) See [III, 7, 1,
19](sbe2627.htm#3:7:1:19) seq.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[313:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_757) Or, the (three)
Uktha-stotras (Sâmav. II, 55-62) and *s*astras, the characteristic
feature of the Ukthya sacrifice. Cf. [p. 325](sbe2650.htm#page_325),
note ; and [IV, 6, 3, 3](sbe2672.htm#4:6:3:3).

<span id="fn_755"></span>[313:2](sbe2649.htm#fr_758) The
Sho*d*a*s*i-stotra (Sâmav. II, 302-304) chanted in the ekavi*ms*a stoma
is the characteristic stotra of the Sho*d*a*s*in sacrifice. The term
meaning 'having a sixteenth' (viz. stotra), it evidently refers
originally to the sacrifice, and has then also been applied to the
stotra and *s*astra. See also Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 255, note 2.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[313:3](sbe2649.htm#fr_759) On this occasion
the same rites are performed as at the sacrifice of the Agnîshomîya buck
([III, 6, 4, 1](sbe2626.htm#3:6:4:1) seq.), viz. from the girding of the
stake ([III, 7, 1, 19](sbe2627.htm#3:7:1:19)) to the election of the
Hot*ri* ([III, 7, 4, 9](sbe2630.htm#3:7:4:9)). Then the other priests
are elected, viz. Adhvaryu (and Pratiprasthât*ri*), the Pra*s*âst*ri*
(Maitrâvaru*n*a), the Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin, the Pot*ri*, the Nesh*tri*,
the Âgnîdhra, and finally the sacrificer himself; after which each of
them makes two election oblations (prav*ri*tahoma) of ghee, the first
with, 'May I be well-pleasing to Speech, well-pleasing to the Lord of
speech: O divine Speech, what sweetest, most pleasing speech is thine,
therewith endow me! Hail to Sarasvatî!' the second with, 'May the holy
Sarasvatî, of abundant powers, rich in devotion, accept favourably our
sacrifice!' Thereupon they proceed with the animal offering up to the
offering of the omentum (vapâ) and cleansing ([III, 8, 2,
30](sbe2632.htm#3:8:2:30)); after which all the eighteen priests and the
sacrificer perform the Sarpa*n*a (see [p. 299](sbe2648.htm#page_299),
note [2](sbe2648.htm#fn_719)), that is, they step up to the eight
dhish*n*ya hearths (with formulas Vâ*g*. S. V, 31 a-d; 32 a-d
respectively), the Adhvaryu then pointing out the Âhavanîya, the
Bahishpavamâna place, the *K*âtvâla, &c. (with Vâ*g*. S. V, 32 e seq.);
and touching the Sadas and its door-posts, and addressing Sûrya (the
sun), the *Ri*tvi*g*s (officiating priests) and dhish*n*ya hearths (with
V, 33-34). Kâty. IX, 8, 8-25. For the duties of the Udgât*ri*s, see
Lâ*t*y. *S*r. II, 2, 10 seq.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[314:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_760) For the metres of
which the Mâdhyandina-pavamâna stotra is composed, see [p.
333](sbe2652.htm#page_333), note [1](sbe2652.htm#fn_787).

<span id="fn_758"></span>[315:1](sbe2649.htm#fr_761) The Ârbhava or
T*ri*tîya-pavamâna stotra, Sâmav. II, 39-52 (see note on [IV, 3, 5,
24](sbe2654.htm#4:3:5:24)), is made up of five parts, composed chiefly
in the Gâyatrî, Kakubh, Ush*n*ih, Anush*t*ubh, and *G*agatî metres
respectively. It is chanted in the Saptada*s*a-stoma, the seventeen
verses being obtained in the following way. The Gâyatrî triplet (II,
39-41) is chanted twice, in the Gâyatra and Sa*m*hita tunes, making six
verses. Then verses 42 and 44 once each, in the Sapha and Paushkala
tunes respectively. Then the triplet II, 47-49 twice, in the
*S*yâvâ*s*va and Ândhîgava tunes (six verses). And finally the triplet
II, 50-52 once, in the Kâva tune (three verses). This makes together
seventeen verses. Verses 43, 45, and 46 of the Sa*m*hita are omitted in
the chanting.

<span id="fn_759"></span>[315:2](sbe2649.htm#fr_762) Paṅkti means both
'a set of five,' and the paṅkti metre, consisting of five octosyllabic
feet.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[315:3](sbe2649.htm#fr_763) See [p.
325](sbe2650.htm#page_325), note [2](sbe2651.htm#fn_774).

<span id="fn_761"></span>[315:4](sbe2649.htm#fr_764) Taitt. Br. I, 5, 11
assigns them to the A*s*vins, for the reason that they performed cures
therewith.

<span id="fn_762"></span>[315:5](sbe2649.htm#fr_765) These five
sacrificial dishes, called savanîyâ*h* (or aindrâ*h*) puro*d*â*s*â*h*,
are placed together in one vessel (pâtrî)--the puro*d*â*s*a proper, or
rice-cake to Indra, being placed in the centre--and oblations are made
from them to the respective deities at one and the same time, two pieces
being cut from each dish into the *g*uhû for the chief offering, and one
piece from each into the upabh*ri*t <span id="page_316">p. 316</span>
spoon, for the svish*t*ak*ri*t. While cutting the portion he calls on
the Maitrâvaru*n*a to 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) of the cakes of
the morning feast for Indra!' The anuvâkyâ (Rig-veda III, 52, 1) having
been recited by the Maitrâvaru*n*a, the Adhvaryu steps to the fire,
calls on the Âgnîdhra for the *S*rausha*t* formula (see I, 5, 2, 16,
with note), and thereupon on the Maitrâvaru*n*a to Urge the cakes of the
morning feast brought forward for Indra!' That priest then urges, 'Let
the Hot*ri* pronounce the offering prayer to Indra! May Indra with his
bays eat the grain! \[O Hotar, pronounce the offering prayer!\]'
Whereupon the Hot*ri* recites, We who worship (part i, p. 142,
note),--May Indra with his bays eat the grains, with Pûshan the
porridge; with Sarasvatî, with Bhâratî, the sour curds, with Mitra and
Varu*n*a the clotted curds! \[cf. Ait. Br. II, 24; Taitt. Br. I, 5, 11;
Â*s*v. V, 4, 3\] Vausha*t*!' when the Adhvaryu pours the oblation into
the fire. For the oblation to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t the invitatory prayer
is Rig-Veda III, 28, 1, and the offering formula 'Havir agne vîhi,'
'graciously accept the offering, O Agni!' The offerings completed, the
dishes of sacrificial food. are placed on the Hot*ri*'s hearth.
