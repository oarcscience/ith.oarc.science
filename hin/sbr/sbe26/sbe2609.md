#### THE PRÂYA*N*ÎYESH*T*I, OR OPENING-SACRIFICE.

### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:1">3:2:3:1</span></span>1. He
prepares the Prâya*n*îya rice-pap for Aditi. Now while the gods were
spreading (performing) the sacrifice on this (earth) they excluded her
(the earth) from the sacrifice. She thought, 'How is it that, in
spreading the sacrifice on me, they should exclude me from the
sacrifice?' and confounded their sacrifice: they knew not that
sacrifice.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:2">3:2:3:2</span></span>2. They
said, 'How comes it that our sacrifice was confounded, when we spread it
on this (earth)? how is it that we know it not?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:3">3:2:3:3</span></span>3. They
said, 'In spreading the sacrifice on her, we have excluded her from the
sacrifice: it is she that has confounded our sacrifice,--let us have
recourse to her!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:4">3:2:3:4</span></span>4. They
said, 'When we were spreading the sacrifice on thee, how was it that it
became confounded, that we know it not?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:5">3:2:3:5</span></span>5. She
said, 'While spreading the sacrifice on me, ye have excluded me from the
sacrifice: that was why I have confounded your sacrifice. Set ye aside a
share for me; then ye shall see the sacrifice, then ye shall know it!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:6">3:2:3:6</span></span>6. 'So be
it!' said the gods: 'Thine, forsooth, shall be the opening
(prâya*n*îya <span id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_125)), and thine the
concluding (udayanîya) oblation!' This is why both the Prâya*n*îya and
the Udayanîya (pap) belong

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

to Aditi; for Aditi truly is this (earth). Thereupon they saw and spread
the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:7">3:2:3:7</span></span>7. Hence,
when he prepares the Prâya*n*îya rice-pap for Aditi, he does so for the
purpose of his seeing the sacrifice: 'After seeing the sacrifice I shall
buy (the Soma) and spread that (sacrifice);' thus thinking he prepares
the Prâya*n*îya pap for Aditi. The sacrificial food had been prepared,
but offering had not yet been made to the deity (Aditi),--

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:8">3:2:3:8</span></span>8. When
Pathyâ Svasti <span id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_126) appeared to them.
They offered to her, for Pathyâ Svasti (the wishing of 'a happy
journey') is speech, and the sacrifice also is speech. Thereby they
perceived the sacrifice and spread it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:9">3:2:3:9</span></span>9.
Thereupon Agni appeared to them: they offered to him; whereby they
perceived that part of the sacrifice which was of Agni's nature. Now of
Agni's nature is what is dry in the sacrifice: that they thereby
perceived and spread.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:10">3:2:3:10</span></span>10.
Then Soma appeared to them: they offered to him; whereby they perceived
that part of the sacrifice which was of Soma's nature. Now of Soma's
nature is what is moist in the sacrifice: that they thereby perceived
and spread.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:11">3:2:3:11</span></span>11.
Then Savit*ri* appeared to them: they offered to him. Now Savit*ri*
represents cattle, and the sacrifice also means cattle: hence they
thereby perceived and spread the sacrifice. Thereupon they offered to
the deity (Aditi), for whom the sacrificial food had been prepared.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:12">3:2:3:12</span></span>12. It
is to these same five deities, then, that he offers. For that sacrifice,
when thrown into disorder,

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

was in five parts; and by means of those five deities they recognised
it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:13">3:2:3:13</span></span>13. The
seasons became confounded, the five: by means of those same five deities
they recognised them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:14">3:2:3:14</span></span>14. The
regions became confounded, the five: by means of those same five deities
they recognised them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:15">3:2:3:15</span></span>15.
Through Pathyâ Svasti they recognised the northern (upper) region:
wherefore speech sounds higher here <span
id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_127) among the Kuru-Pa*ñk*âlas; for she
(Pathyâ Svasti) is in reality speech, and through her they recognised
the northern region, and to her belongs the northern region.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:16">3:2:3:16</span></span>16.
Through Agni they recognised the eastern region: wherefore they take out
Agni from behind towards the east <span id="fr_129"></span>[2](#fn_128),
and render homage to him; for through him they recognised the eastern
region, and to him belongs the eastern region.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:17">3:2:3:17</span></span>17.
Through Soma they recognised the southern region: hence, after the Soma
has been bought, they drive it round on the south side; and hence they
say that Soma is sacred to the Fathers; for through him they recognised
the southern region, and to him belongs the southern region.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:18">3:2:3:18</span></span>18.
Through Savit*ri* they recognised the western region, for Savit*ri* is
yonder burning (sun): wherefore he goes towards the west, for through
him they recognised the western region, and to him belongs the western
region.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:19">3:2:3:19</span></span>19.
Through Aditi they recognised the upper region, for Aditi is this
(earth): wherefore the plants and trees grow upwards on her; for through
her they recognised the upper region, and to her belongs the upper
region.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:20">3:2:3:20</span></span>20. The
hospitable reception <span id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_129) (of King
Soma) verily is the head of the sacrifice, and the opening and closing
oblations are its arms. But the arms are on both sides of the head, and
hence those two oblations, the Prâya*n*îya and Udayanîya, are made on
both sides of (before and after) the reception.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:21">3:2:3:21</span></span>21.
Now, they say that whatever is done at the Prâya*n*îya should be done at
the Udayanîya <span id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_130), and the barhis
(grass-covering of the altar), which is used at the Prâya*n*îya, is also
used at the Udayanîya: he lays it aside, after removing it (from the
altar). The pot (in which the rice-pap was cooked) he puts aside with
the parched remains of dough, and (so he does) the pot-ladle after
wiping it. And the priests who officiate during the Prâya*n*îya,
officiate also at the Udayanîya. And because of this identical
performance at the sacrifice the two arms are alike and of the same
shape.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:22">3:2:3:22</span></span>22. But
let him not do it in this way. Let him rather <span
id="fr_132"></span>[3](#fn_131) (at the proper time) throw both the
barhis and the pot-ladle after (the prastara, into the fire <span
id="fr_133"></span>[4](#fn_132)), and let him put the pot aside after
rinsing it. The priests who officiate during the Prâya*n*îya, officiate
also at the Udayanîya; but should they (in the

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

mean time) have departed this life, others may officiate instead. It is
because he offers to the same deities, and the same oblations, that the
two arms are alike and of the same shape.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:2:3:23">3:2:3:23</span></span>23. To
five deities he offers at the Prâya*n*îya, and to five at the Udayanîya:
hence there are five fingers here and five there. This (Prâya*n*îya
offering) ends with the *S*amyu. They perform no Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as <span
id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_133). For the arms are on the fore-part of
the body, and the fore-part of the sacrifice he perfects by this
(opening ceremony). This is why it ends with the *S*amyu, and why no
Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as are performed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_125"></span>[48:1](sbe2609.htm#fr_126) At [IV, 5, 1,
2](sbe2660.htm#4:5:1:2), the name prâya*n*îya is derived from pra-i, to
go forth, because by means of this offering they, as it were, go forth
to buy the Soma. Similarly, udayanîya is explained as the offering he
performs after coming out (ud-i) from the bath. In Ait. Br. I, 7, on the
other hand, the name prâya*n*îya is explained as that by means of which
sacrificers go forward (pra-i) to the heavenly world. In the Soma
sacrifice, the Prâya*n*îyâ and Udayanîyâ may be said to correspond to
the Fore-offerings and After-offerings (prayâ*g*a and anuyâ*g*a) of the
New and Full-moon Sacrifice; though, of course, the Fore- and
After-offerings form part of the prâya*n*îyâ and udayanîyâ, as ish*t*is.
But they are peculiar in this respect, that offering is made at both to
the very same deities, and that the invitatory prayers (anuvâkyâ) of the
prâya*n*îyesh*t*i form the offering-prayers (yâ*g*yâ) of the
udayanîyesh*t*i, and vice versâ. For these formulas, see Â*s*val.
*S*rautas. IV, 3; Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 16. The offering formula of
the oblation to Aditi at the Prâya*n*îyâ (and invitatory formula at the
Udayanîyâ), strange to say, is not a *Ri*k-verse, but one from the
Atharvan (VII, 6, 2).

<span id="fn_126"></span>[49:1](sbe2609.htm#fr_127) I.e. 'welfare on the
road, or a happy journey,' a genius of well-being and prosperity.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[50:1](sbe2609.htm#fr_128) Atra,? 'there.' In
the St. Petersb. Dict. uttarâhi is here taken in the sense of 'in the
north,' instead of 'higher.' See also part i, pref. p. xlii, note 1;
Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 191.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[50:2](sbe2609.htm#fr_129) That is, from the
Gârhapatya to the Âhavanîya fire-place.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[51:1](sbe2609.htm#fr_130) See [III, 4,
1](sbe2615.htm#3:4:1).

<span id="fn_130"></span>[51:2](sbe2609.htm#fr_131) See [p.
48](#page_48), note [1](#fn_125). For the Udayanîya, see [IV, 5,
1](sbe2660.htm#4:5:1).

<span id="fn_131"></span>[51:3](sbe2609.htm#fr_132) Or, perhaps, 'let
him, if he chooses (kâmam) . . .;' see Kâty. VII, 5, 16-19; cf. also
note on [III, 2, 4, 14](sbe2610.htm#3:2:4:14).

<span id="fn_132"></span>[51:4](sbe2609.htm#fr_133) See I, 8, 3, 19; 9,
2, 29.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[52:1](sbe2609.htm#fr_134) For the *S*amyuvâka,
see I, 9, 1, 24; for the Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as, I, 9, 2: 1 seq.
