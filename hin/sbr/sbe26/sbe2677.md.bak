### EIGHTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:1">4:6:8:1</span></span>1. Now
the consecration-ceremony <span id="fr_1024"></span>[3](#fn_1018.md) (for
the sacrificial session) is a sitting down, is a session (sattra): hence
they say of them, 'they sit.' And when thereafter they perform the
sacrifice, then they (under)go; then he, who is the leader, leads: hence
they say of them, 'they (under)go <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[4](#fn_1019.md).'

<span id="page_441">p. 441</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:2">4:6:8:2</span></span>2. The
consecration-ceremony, then, is a sitting down, it is a session, it is
an (under)going, it is the (under)going of a session. And when
afterwards, having reached the end of the sacrifice, they rise, that is
'the rising:' hence they say of them, 'They have risen.' So much, then,
for preliminary remark.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:3">4:6:8:3</span></span>3. Now
those who are about to consecrate themselves settle (the time and place)
between them. If they intend to construct a fire-altar, they take up
their (ordinary sacrificial) fires on churning-sticks <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[1](#fn_1020.md) and betake themselves together to
where they are about to perform the animal offering to Pra*g*âpati.
Having churned (the fire), and put fire-wood on, they take out the
Âhavanîya fire, and perform that animal offering to Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:4">4:6:8:4</span></span>4. Its
head they keep <span id="fr_1027"></span>[2](#fn_1021.md). If their
consecration does not fall upon that same day (of the animal offering),
then, taking up the fires (again) on the churning-sticks, they disperse
to their several (homes) and perform the (daily) offerings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:5">4:6:8:5</span></span>5. But if
their consecration falls upon that same day, then, taking up the fires
(again) on the churning-sticks, they betake themselves to where they
intend to perform the consecration-ceremony. The G*ri*hapati <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[3](#fn_1022) churns (his fire.md) first somewhere
about the centre of the hall; and one half of the others settle down
south and one half north of him. Having

<span id="page_442">p. 442</span>

churned (their fires), and put on fire-wood, they take one fire-brand
each and betake themselves together to the G*ri*hapati's Gârhapatya
fire. Having taken out the Âhavanîya from the G*ri*hapati's Gârhapatya,
they perform the consecration-ceremony. They have one and the same
Âhavanîya, but different Gârhapatyas, during the consecration and the
Upasads <span id="fr_1029"></span>[1](#fn_1023.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:6">4:6:8:6</span></span>6. Then,
on whatever day their purchase (of Soma-plants) takes place, on that day
he raises the Gârhapatya hearth; and on the Upavasatha day <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[2](#fn_1024.md) the dhish*n*ya hearths for the others.
At the time of the Vaisar*g*ina <span id="fr_1031"></span>[3](#fn_1025.md)
offerings, the wives come forward together and they (the sacrificers)
abandon those other (Gârhapatya) fires <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[4](#fn_1026.md). As soon as the Vaisar*g*ina offering
has been performed,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:7">4:6:8:7</span></span>7. He
leads forward the king (Soma). That Âgnîdhrîya fire has just been taken
up on the support <span id="fr_1033"></span>[5](#fn_1027.md), when they
take one fire-brand each (from the fire at the hall-door) and disperse
to their several dhish*n*ya hearths: 'They who do so,' said
Yâ*gñ*avalkya, 'slay with those fire-brands of theirs.' This now is one
way.

<span id="page_443">p. 443</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:8">4:6:8:8</span></span>8. Then
there is this second. Having taken up their fires on churning-sticks,
they betake themselves to where they intend to perform the animal
offering to Pra*g*âpati. Having churned (the fire), and put on
(fire-wood), they take out the Âhavanîya and perform that animal
offering to Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:9">4:6:8:9</span></span>9. Its
head they keep. If their consecration does not fall upon the same day,
then, taking up the fires (again) on the churning-sticks, they disperse
to their several (homes), and perform (the ordinary) offerings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:10">4:6:8:10</span></span>10. But
if their consecration falls upon the same day, then, taking up the fires
(again) on the churning-sticks, they betake themselves to where they
intend to perform the consecration-ceremony. The G*ri*hapati churns
first, and then the others churn, seated round about him, and throw each
the (fire) produced by him on the G*ri*hapati's Gârhapatya. Having taken
out the Âhavanîya from the G*ri*hapati's Gârhapatya, they perform the
Dîkshâ. Theirs is the same Âhavanîya and the same Gârhapatya during the
consecration and the Upasads.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:11">4:6:8:11</span></span>11.
Then, on whatever day their purchase (of Soma-plants) takes place, on
that day he piles up the Gârhapatya hearth, and on the Upavasatha day
the dhish*n*ya hearths for the others. At the time of the Vaisar*g*ina
offerings the wives come forward together; they (the sacrificers)
abandon that (common Gârhapatya) fire. As soon as the Vaisar*g*ina
offering has taken place,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:12">4:6:8:12</span></span>12. He
leads forward the king. That Âgnîdhrîya fire has just been taken up on
the support, when they take one fire-brand each and disperse to their
several dhish*n*ya hearths. But those who do it thus, raise

<span id="page_444">p. 444</span>

up strife, and strife comes upon them; they become contentious, and,
moreover, strife comes upon that community where they sacrifice. This is
the second way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:13">4:6:8:13</span></span>13.
Then there is this third. They commune with each other over the
G*ri*hapati's churning-sticks,--'What fire shall be produced therefrom,
be that ours in common! what we shall gain by this sacrifice, by this
animal offering, be that ours in common! In common be our good work!
whosoever shall do evil, be that his alone!' Having thus spoken, the
G*ri*hapati first takes up (the fire on the churning-sticks) for
himself, then he takes it up for the others, or they take it <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[1](#fn_1028.md) up for themselves. They betake
themselves to where they intend to perform the animal offering to
Pra*g*âpati. Having churned (the fire) and put on (fire-wood), they take
out the Âhavanîya and perform that animal offering to Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:14">4:6:8:14</span></span>14. Its
head they keep. If their consecration does not fall on the same day,
then, taking up (again) the fires on the churning-sticks, they disperse
to their several (homes), and perform (the ordinary) offerings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:15">4:6:8:15</span></span>15. But
if their consecration falls on the same day, they commune with each
other over the G*ri*hapati's churning-sticks,--'What fire shall be
produced therefrom, be that ours in common! what we shall gain by this
sacrifice, by this session, be that ours in common! In common be our
good work! Whosoever shall do evil, be that his alone!' Having thus
spoken, the G*ri*hapati first takes up (the fire) on the churning-sticks
for himself, then he takes it up for

<span id="page_445">p. 445</span>

the others, or they take it up for themselves. They betake themselves to
where they intend to perform the consecration-ceremony. Having churned
(the fire) and put on (fire-wood), they take out the Âhavanîya and
perform the consecration-ceremony. Theirs is the same Âhavanîya and the
same Gârhapatya during the consecration and the Upasads.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:16">4:6:8:16</span></span>16. And
on whatever day their purchase (of Soma-plants) takes place, on that day
he piles up the Gârhapatya hearth, and on the Upavasatha day the
dhish*n*ya hearths for the others. At the time of the Vaisar*g*ina
offerings the wives come forward together; and they (the sacrificers)
abandon that (Gârhapatya) fire. As soon as the Vaisar*g*ina offering has
been performed,

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:17">4:6:8:17</span></span>17. He
leads forward the king. That Âgnîdhrîya fire has just been taken up on
the support, when they take one fire-brand each and disperse to their
several dhish*n*ya hearths. Thus is this done, and not (left) undone.
The reason why they have different dhish*n*yas, is that there may be
wider space for moving about; and why they have different
puro*d*â*s*as <span id="fr_1035"></span>[1](#fn_1029.md), is that more
sacrificial food may be left over for completeness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:18">4:6:8:18</span></span>18. Now
then the sacrificial session is explained, whereby the gods quickly
drove out evil, and gained the supreme authority which they now wield:
having one G*ri*hapati, one puro*d*â*s*a, one dhish*n*ya, they quickly
drove out mischief and quickly were born again. And in like manner will
these (sacrificers), by having one G*ri*hapati, one puro*d*â*s*a, one
dhish*n*ya, quickly drive out evil and be born again.

<span id="page_446">p. 446</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:19">4:6:8:19</span></span>19.
Now, in that former case, there is a hall with the roof-beams running
from south to north <span
id="fr_1036"></span>[1](sbe2678.htm#fn_1030.md),--that is human practice.
There are one and the same Âhavanîya, and different Gârhapatyas--that is
dissimilar. On the G*ri*hapati's Gârhapatya they perform the
Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as with the tail (of the victim), and the others sit
offering in response with ghee--that is dissimilar:

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:8:20">4:6:8:20</span></span>20. But
here there is a hall with the roof-beams running from west to east <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[2](sbe2678.htm#fn_1031.md): that is as with the gods.
There are the same Âhavanîya, the same Gârhapatya, and the same
Âgnîdhrîya: thus this sacrificial session is successful, even as the one
day's Soma-sacrifice was successful, there is no failure for it. Its
course is one and the same in everything except the dhish*n*yas.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1018"></span>[440:3](sbe2677.htm#fr_1024.md) For the Dîkshâ
see [III, 1, 1, 1](sbe2603.htm#3:1:1:1.md) seq. In the Kâ*n*va text I have
found nothing corresponding to the present Brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_1019"></span>[440:4](sbe2677.htm#fr_1025.md) That is to say,
the verb 'i' (to go; more especially its compound upa-i, to undergo, go
through, undertake) is used of sacrificial performances in the Sattra
lasting for twelve (pressing) days and upward, to distinguish the latter
from the ahîna-sacrifices, lasting for from two to twelve (pressing)
days.

<span id="fn_1020"></span>[441:1](sbe2677.htm#fr_1026.md) That is to say,
they hold their churning-sticks to the fires to get warm; see part i, p.
396, note 1.

<span id="fn_1021"></span>[441:2](sbe2677.htm#fr_1027.md) The head of the
victim (or victims, see VI, 2, 1 seq.) will have to be put in the bottom
layer of the fire-altar, to impart stability to the latter.

<span id="fn_1022"></span>[441:3](sbe2677.htm#fr_1028.md) See [p.
97](sbe2616.htm#page_97), note [1](sbe2616.htm#fn_255.md). At a Sattra the
G*ri*hapati, as well as all the other *ri*tvig, should be a Brahman;
Kâty. I, 6, 13-16.

<span id="fn_1023"></span>[442:1](sbe2677.htm#fr_1029.md) At Sattras there
are usually twelve Upasad days. See [p. 105](sbe2618.htm#page_105.md), note
[1](sbe2618.htm#fn_273.md). Ait. Br. IV, 24 enjoins twelve days for the
Dîkshâ and as many for the Upasads of the Dvâda*s*âha. Kâty. XII, 1, 19;
2, 14 gives no special rule regarding the duration of the Dîkshâ, but
enjoins twelve Upasads. See also Lâ*t*y. III, 3, 27; Â*s*v. VI, 1, 2.

<span id="fn_1024"></span>[442:2](sbe2677.htm#fr_1030.md) The day before
the first pressing day.

<span id="fn_1025"></span>[442:3](sbe2677.htm#fr_1031.md) See [III, 6, 3,
1](sbe2625.htm#3:6:3:1.md) seq.

<span id="fn_1026"></span>[442:4](sbe2677.htm#fr_1032.md) Or, those minor
(? western) fires, viz. they extinguish those south and north of the
G*ri*hapati's Gârhapatya; or (optionally) also the latter, it being
again supplied by the fire-brand from the Sâlâdvârya fire. Cf. Kâty.
XII, 1, 25-26.

<span id="fn_1027"></span>[442:5](sbe2677.htm#fr_1033.md) See [III, 6, 3,
9](sbe2625.htm#3:6:3:9.md) seq.

<span id="fn_1028"></span>[444:1](sbe2677.htm#fr_1034.md) Or, according to
Kâty. XII, 2, 8-9, each takes up two fires, viz. his own and that of the
G*ri*hapati.

<span id="fn_1029"></span>[445:1](sbe2677.htm#fr_1035.md) The usual
Savanîya-puro*d*â*s*as ([III, 8, 3, 1](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:1).md) are to be
offered separately on each fire.
