### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:2:1">4:3:2:1</span></span>1. Now
truly when the Hot*ri* praises (recites the *s*astra <span
id="fr_777"></span>[2](#fn_774).md), he sings, and to him thus singing the

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Adhvaryu responds
(prati-â-gar), whence the name response (pratigara).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:2:2">4:3:2:2</span></span>2. \[The
Hot*ri*\] calls upon that (Adhvaryu) seated (before him) with his face
towards the east <span id="fr_778"></span>[1](#fn_775.md). For all

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

others except the Udgât*ri* perform their priestly duties while facing
the east, and in this manner that priestly duty of his is performed
towards the east.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:2:3">4:3:2:3</span></span>3. Now
the Udgât*ri* is Pra*g*âpati, and the Hot*ri*, (being) the *Ri*k (fem.),
is a female. And when he chants, then the Udgât*ri*, Pra*g*âpati,
implants seed in the female Hot*ri*, the *Ri*k; this the Hot*ri* brings
forth by means of the *s*astra (recitation), he sharpens

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

it even as this man is sharpened <span id="fr_779"></span>[1](#fn_776.md),
and because he thereby sharpens (*s*o) therefore it is called sastra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:2:4">4:3:2:4</span></span>4. Having
turned round (so as to face the Hot*ri*, the Adhvaryu) then responds:
thereby he quickens <span id="fr_780"></span>[2](#fn_777.md) that implanted
seed. On the other hand, were he to respond while standing with his face
turned away (from the Hot*ri*), that implanted seed would assuredly
perish away, and would not be brought forth; but thus facing each other
(the male and female) bring forth the implanted seed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:2:5">4:3:2:5</span></span>5. Now
the strength of the metres was exhausted by the gods, for it was by the
metres that the gods attained the world of heaven. And the response
(song) is ecstasy (mada <span id="fr_781"></span>[3](#fn_778).md)--what
ecstasy there is in the *rik* and that which there is in the Sâman, that
is sap: this sap he now lays into the metres, and thus makes the metres
of restored strength; and with them of restored strength they perform
the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:2:6">4:3:2:6</span></span>6. Hence
if (the Hot*ri*) recites by half-verses, let (the Adhvaryu) respond at
each half-verse; and if he recites by pâdas (hemistichs), let him
respond at each pâda. For whenever, in reciting, he (the Hot*ri*) draws
breath, there the Asura-Rakshas rush into the sacrifice: there he (the
Adhvaryu) closes it up by means of the response, so that the evil
spirits, the Rakshas, cannot rush in; and thus he destroys the world of
the sacrificer's enemies.

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:2:7">4:3:2:7</span></span>7. Now,
in the beginning the metres consisted of four syllables. Then *G*agatî
flew up for Soma and came back, leaving behind three syllables. Then
Trish*t*ubh flew up for Soma and came back, leaving behind one syllable.
Then Gâyatrî flew up for Soma, and she came back bringing with her those
syllables as well as Soma. Thus she came to consist of eight syllables:
wherefore they say, 'Gâyatrî is octosyllabic.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:2:8">4:3:2:8</span></span>8. With
her they performed the morning feast of the Soma-sacrifice,--whence the
morning feast pertains to Gâyatrî. With her they performed the midday
feast. Trish*t*ubh then said to her, 'To thee will I come with three
syllables: invite me, and exclude me not from the sacrifice!'--'So be
it!' she said and invited her. Thus the Trish*t*ubh came to consist of
eleven syllables, and therefore they say, 'The midday Soma feast
pertains to Trish*t*ubh.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:2:9">4:3:2:9</span></span>9. With
her (Gâyatrî) indeed they performed the evening feast. *G*agatî then
said to her, 'To thee will I come with one syllable: invite me, and
exclude me not from the sacrifice!'--'So be it!' she said and invited
her. Thus the *G*agatî came to consist of twelve syllables; and
therefore they say, 'The evening Soma feast pertains to *G*agatî.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:2:10">4:3:2:10</span></span>10. As
to this they say, 'Surely all the Soma feasts pertain to Gâyatrî, since
Gâyatrî alone went on increasing.' At the morning feast he should
therefore respond with a complete (formula), for complete <span
id="fr_782"></span>[1](#fn_779.md) Gâyatrî returned. At the midday feast

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (he responds with
a formula) containing once (the verb) 'to rejoice (mad) <span
id="fr_783"></span>[1](#fn_780),' for she (Trish*t*ubh.md) came back,
leaving one syllable behind; and with that same (formula) he then
completes her, makes her whole,

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:2:11">4:3:2:11</span></span>11.
When trish*t*ubh verses were recited. At the evening Soma feast (the
Adhvaryu responds with a formula) containing thrice (the verb) 'to
rejoice <span id="fr_784"></span>[2](#fn_781),' for she (*G*agatî.md) came
back leaving three syllables behind; and with these (formulas) he then
completes her, makes her whole,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:2:12">4:3:2:12</span></span>12.
When (the hymn) to Heaven and Earth is recited <span
id="fr_785"></span>[3](#fn_782.md). Now these creatures subsist on those
two,

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

the heaven and the earth--he thereby imbues those two, heaven and earth,
with vigour; and upon those two, thus vigorous and affording the means
of subsistence, these creatures subsist. Let him respond with 'Om!'
only, for that is truth, that the gods know.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:2:13">4:3:2:13</span></span>13. Now
some respond with 'Othâmo daiva vâk,' saying, 'The response is speech
(vâk): thus we obtain speech.' But let him not do this; for surely, in
whichsoever way he may respond, speech is obtained by him, since he
responds by speech. Let him therefore respond with 'Om <span
id="fr_786"></span>[1](#fn_783.md)!' only, for that is truth, that the gods
know.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_774"></span>[325:2](sbe2651.htm#fr_777.md) Every chant or hymn
(stotra) of the Udgât*ri*s is followed by a 'song of praise' (*s*astra)
recited by the Hot*ri* or one of his three assistants (Maitrâvaru*n*a,
Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin, and A*kh*âvâka); the first two *s*astras at each
savana being recited by the Hot*ri*, and the three additional ones at
the morning and midday feast by his assistants (Hotrakas). The exact
correlation between the stotras and *s*astras at the three savanas will
appear from the following table:--

I. Prâta*h*-savana.

|                             |                                  |

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

III\. T*ri*tîya-savana.

|                                              |                                     |

| 11\. Ârbhava (or T*ri*tîya)-pavamâna.        | 11\. Vai*s*vadeva-sastra (Hot*ri*). |
| 12\. Agnish*t*oma-sâman (Ya*gñ*â-ya*gñ*îya). | 12\. Âgnimâruta-*s*astra (Hot*ri*). |

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> These are the
twelve stotras and *s*astras of the Agnish*t*oma. At the Ukthya
sacrifice, the performance of the evening feast is completed by the
addition of three uktha stotras and *s*astras, one for each Hotraka.

<span id="fn_775"></span>[326:1](sbe2651.htm#fr_778.md) While the Adhvaryu
sits before the Sadas, with his back to the Hot*ri* ([p.
322](sbe2650.htm#page_322), note [1](sbe2650.htm#fn_771).md), the latter
performs the (tûsh*n*îm-) *g*apa--i.e. the muttering of the formula 'May
Father Mâtari*s*van grant flawless (verse-) feet! may the bards sing
flawless hymns!' &c. Ait. Br. II, 38; Â*s*v. *S*r. V, 9, 1--after which
he addresses to the Adhvaryu his call (âhâva), '*s*õ*m*sâvõm (let us two
recite, Om)!'--which formula is used at all *s*astras, except that, at
the midday and evening libations, it is preceded by 'Adhvaryo' (O
Adhvaryu); while at the evening savana the first syllable of the verb is
repeated, thus '*s*o*s*o*m*sâvo.'--The Adhvaryu rises, turns round so as
to face the Hot*ri*, and responds by '*s*o*m*sâmo daiva (we recite, O
divine one)!' According to Ait. Br. III, 12, the Âhâva and Pratigara
together are to consist of the number of syllables corresponding to the
metre of the respective libation, viz. 8, 11, 12 respectively. Then
follows the Hot*ri*s Tûsh*n*î*m*-*s*a*m*sa or 'silent praise;' viz.
'Earth! Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Om!--Indra is the light,
Ether! the light is Indra, Om! Sûrya is the light, the light, Heaven! is
Sûrya, Om!'--This is followed by a Puroru*k*, or preliminary invocation
of a deity, recited in a loud voice, (and consisting of twelve short
formulas resembling the Nivid part i, p. 114, note 2; ib. I, 4, 2, 5
seq.), which, indeed, takes its place in the *s*astras of the midday and
evening libations, being inserted in the middle or before the last verse
of the hymn of the *s*astra; viz. Agni kindled by the gods, Agni kindled
by man, Agni the well-kindling, the Hot*ri* chosen by the gods, the
Hot*ri* chosen by men, the carrier of offerings, the leader of
sacrifices, the irresistible Hot*ri*, the swift carrier of oblations:
may he, the god, <span id="page_327">p. 327</span> bring hither the
gods! may Agni, the god, worship the gods! may (Agni), the knower of
beings, perform the sacrificial rites!' (Ait. Br. II, 34.) Then follows
the hymn, the Â*g*ya-sûkta, the chief part of the *s*astra, viz.
Rig-veda III, 13, 'To him, your god Agni, will I sing with loudest
voice; may he come hither to us with the gods; may he, the best offerer,
sit down on our sacred grass!' &c.; the seven (anush*t*ubh) verses of
which are recited in the order 1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 2, 7. The first and last
verses being, however, repeated thrice, the number is thus raised to
eleven. The recitation of the hymn is followed by the so-called
ukthavîrya ('the strength of the praise'), consisting of the formula
uktha*m* vâ*k*i, 'praise hath been sung,' with some words added to it
differing at different *s*astras,--at the present *s*astra 'ghoshâya
tvâ,' 'thee (I have recited) for sound (praise)!' \[for
school-differences as to these formulas, see Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p.
177\],--to which the Adhvaryu responds, 'Om ukthasâ*h*,' 'yea, singer of
praise!' The Ukthavîrya, together with the response, is again to consist
of as many syllables as the characteristic metre of the respective
libation. Then follows the recitation, by the Âgnîdhra (Ait. Br. VI,
14), of the yâ*g*yâ or offering prayer, viz. Rig-veda III, 25, 4.--As
regards the term 'â*g*ya,' the Pa*ñk*. Br. VII, 2, 1, 2, derives it from
â*g*i, a race, in accordance with the following legend: When Pra*g*âpati
offered himself as a sacrifice to the gods, the latter could not agree
as to which of them should have the first share. Pra*g*âpati then
proposed that they should run a race for it. In this race Agni came off
first, then Mitravaruna, then Indra. To each of these three divinities
an â*g*ya was thereupon assigned; and, by a secret understanding between
Indra and Agni, these two divided the fourth â*g*ya between them. Hence
the âgneya, maitrâvaru*n*a, aindra, and aindrâgna *s*astra (and stotra),
belonging to the Hot*ri*, Maitrâvaru*n*a, Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin, and
A*kh*âvâka priests respectively.

<span id="fn_776"></span>[328:1](sbe2651.htm#fr_779.md) That is, fashions
him, or makes him slender. A fanciful derivation of *s*astra (*s*a*m*s,
to recite, praise, cf. carmen), from the root *s*â (*s*o), to sharpen (?
or from *s*as, to cut, carve). 'Yathâyam purovartî purushas
tîksh*n*ak*ri*ta*h*, avaya(va)vibhâgena spash*t*îk*ri*tas tathâ
*s*astre*n*aitad reta*h* *s*yati spash*t*a*m* karoti,' Sây.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[328:2](sbe2651.htm#fr_780.md) Upanimadati,
'cheers;' the Kâ*n*va text (W.) has 'upanivadati.'

<span id="fn_778"></span>[328:3](sbe2651.htm#fr_781.md) Or, intoxication,
intoxicating drink. See [paragraph 10](sbe2651.htm#4:3:2:10.md), and [p.
330](#page_330), note [1](#fn_780.md)

<span id="fn_779"></span>[329:1](sbe2651.htm#fr_782.md) Or perhaps,
successful, sa*m*siddhâ \[svakîyâny aksharâ*n*y aparitya*g*yâvik*ri*tâ
(? avik*ri*ttâ), Sây.\]. The response (pratigara) here alluded to, is
probably the one ordinarily used by the Adhvaryu, whenever the Hot*ri*
pauses in his recitation, at the end of half-verses <span
id="page_330">p. 330</span> (or pâdas), nivids, &c., viz. 'Othamo
daiva,'--or, Othâvo daivom, whenever the Hot*ri* puts in the sacred
syllable 'om.' 'Tasmât kâra*n*âd gâyatra-prâta*h*savane sa*m*siddham
avik*ri*ta*m* vidhâsyamânam omantam prati-g*ri*h*n*îyât,' Sây. For the
Adhvaryu's response, '*s*a*m*sâmo daiva,' to the Hot*ri*'s summons
(âhâva), see [p. 326](#page_326), note [1](#fn_775.md).

<span id="fn_780"></span>[330:1](sbe2651.htm#fr_783.md) When the first
verse of the trish*t*ubh hymn, Rig-veda X, 73, is recited by the Hot*ri*
in the Marutvatîya Sastra at the midday feast, the Adhvaryu's response
is 'madâmo daiva' (we rejoice, O divine one). Kâty. X, 3, 8; cf. Weber,
Ind. Stud. X, p. 37.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[330:2](sbe2651.htm#fr_784.md) According to Kâty.
X, 6, 6 'madâmo daiva' is optionally the Adhvaryu's response at the
recitation in the Âgnimârutra *S*astra of three of the so-called
Anupânîya (or Svâdushkilîya) trish*t*ubh verses VI, 47, 1-4 (see note on
[IV, 4, 2, 18](sbe2656.htm#4:4:2:18).md). Possibly the present paragraph
may refer to those verses, in which case the words 'when trish*t*ubh
verses are recited' would begin a fresh paragraph. Sâya*n*a, however,
seems to take it in the same way as above; cf. also the Kâ*n*va reading
in next note.

<span id="fn_782"></span>[330:3](sbe2651.htm#fr_785.md) This is the
(*G*agatî) hymn I, 159 recited in the Vai*s*vadeva Sastra. According to
Kâty. X, 6, 5, the response is to be thrice (after each of the three
first verses) 'madâmo daiva.' The Kâ*n*va has for paragraphs 10-12, 'At
the morning feast he responds by a complete (formula), for complete
Gâyatrî returned. At the midday feast he responds once with one
containing "mad," when he <span id="page_331">p. 331</span> recites
trish*t*ubh verses, for she (Trish*t*ubh) returned leaving one syllable
behind: hereby now he completes her, makes her whole. At the evening
feast with something containing thrice "mad," for she (*G*agatî)
returned leaving three syllables behind: hereby now he completes her,
makes her whole. At the (hymn) to Heaven and Earth he responds with one
that contains "mad;" when he recites (the hymn) Heaven and Earth--these
creatures subsisting on those two, Heaven and Earth--he thereby puts
juice into them, and upon those two, thus rendered juiceful, these
creatures subsist. He responds with "Om," for that is truth, that the
gods know.'

<span id="fn_783"></span>[331:1](sbe2651.htm#fr_786.md) That is, instead of
'vâk,' hence 'Othâmo daivom.' 'Om' pure and simple is the response at
the end of the *s*astra.
