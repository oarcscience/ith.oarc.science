<P><A NAME="fn_935"></A><A HREF="sbe2663.htm#fr_943">402:2</A> The Dv&acirc;da<I>s</I>&acirc;ha, or twelve days&#8217; performance, forms the connecting link between the so-called Ah&icirc;na sacrifices (consisting of between two and twelve press-days) and the sattras, or sacrificial sessions (of twelve press-days and upwards); since it can be performed as one or the other. As a sattra (which seems to be its usual character) it consists of the Da<I>s</I>ar&acirc;tra, or ten nights&#8217; (or days&#8217;) period, preceded and followed by an Atir&acirc;tra, as the pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya (opening) and udayan&icirc;ya (concluding) days. The Da<I>s</I>ar&acirc;tra, on its part, consists of three tryahas (or tridua), viz. a P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya sha<I>d</I>aha (see note &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_942"></A><A HREF="#fn_937"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>), and three Ukthya days, the so-called <I>Kh</I>andomas (on which see Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 347). These are followed by an Atyagnish<I>t</I>oma day, called Aviv&acirc;kya (i.e. on which there should be 'no dispute, or quarrel').</P>

In this, as in the preceding Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, the prefix ati has to do service repeatedly for etymological and symbolical purposes.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_937"></A><A HREF="sbe2663.htm#fr_942">402:4</A> I.e. cups of Soma 'to be drawn over and above' (Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 235; for a different explanation see Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 490). These three grahas are required at the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya sha<I>d</I>aha, which forms part of the Dv&acirc;da<I>s</I>&acirc;ha (see note &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_943"></A><A HREF="#fn_935"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>), and of sacrificial sessions generally. The sha<I>d</I>aha, or period of six Soma days, which (though itself consisting of two tryaha, or <A NAME="page_403"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 403</FONT></A> tridua) may be considered as forming a kind of unit in sattras, or sacrificial sessions, is of two kinds, viz. the Abhiplava sha<I>d</I>aha and the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya sha<I>d</I>aha. Both require (for the Hot<I>ri</I>'s p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra at the midday pressing) the use of the Rathantara-s&acirc;man on uneven, and that of the B<I>ri</I>hat-s&acirc;man on even days. The chief difference between them is that while the p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotras of the Abhiplava are performed in the ordinary (Agnish<I>t</I>oma) way, the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya sha<I>d</I>aha requires their performance in the proper p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a form, see <A HREF="sbe2652.htm#page_339">p. 339</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2652.htm#fn_801">2</A>. Besides, while the Abhiplava sha<I>d</I>aha consists of four Ukthya days, preceded and followed by one Agnish<I>t</I>oma day; the first day of the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya sha<I>d</I>aha is an Agnish<I>t</I>oma, the fourth a Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in, the remaining four days being Ukthyas. There is also a difference between the two in regard to the stomas, or forms of chanting, used; for while the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya requires successively one of the six principal stomas (from the Triv<I>ri</I>t up to the Trayastri<I>m</I><I>s</I>a, as given <A HREF="sbe2649.htm#page_308">p. 308</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2649.htm#fn_745">2</A>) for each day, the Abhiplava requires the first four stomas (Triv<I>ri</I>t to Ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a) for each day, though in a different order. In this respect, three groups or forms are assumed for the performance of the stotras at the Agnish<I>t</I>oma and Ukthya, viz. the <I>G</I>yotish<I>t</I>oma [a. Bahishpavavam&acirc;na in the Triv<I>ri</I>t; b. &Acirc;<I>g</I>yastotras and c. M&acirc;dhyandina-pavam&acirc;na in the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a; d. the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotras and e. &Acirc;rbhava-pavavam&acirc;na in the Saptada<I>s</I>a; and f. the Agnish<I>t</I>oma s&acirc;man in the Ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a stoma]; the Gosh<I>t</I>oma [a. Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a; b. Triv<I>ri</I>t; c. Saptada<I>s</I>a; e. f. (and g. Ukthastotras) Ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a]; and &Acirc;yush<I>t</I>oma [a. Triv<I>ri</I>t; b. Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a; c. d. Saptada<I>s</I>a; e. f. g. Ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a]. These forms are distributed over the two tridua of the Abhiplava in the order: <I>G</I>yotish<I>t</I>oma, Gosh<I>t</I>oma, &Acirc;yush<I>t</I>oma; Gosh<I>t</I>oma, &Acirc;yush<I>t</I>oma, Gyotish<I>t</I>oma.</P>
