<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:1">4:5:1:1</A></FONT></span>1. He proceeds with the rice-pap to Aditi, as the concluding oblation. The reason why there is a rice-pap for Aditi is this. Because, on that former occasion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the gods said to her, 'Thine forsooth shall be the opening, and thine the concluding oblation,' therefore he prepares that share for her at both ends (of the Soma-sacrifice).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:2">4:5:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. And because, on that occasion, he offers when about to go forth (upa-pra-i) to buy the king (Soma), therefore that (opening oblation) is called Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya. And because he now offers after coming out (ud-&acirc;-i) from the expiatory bath, therefore this (concluding oblation) is called Udaya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. For this indeed is one and the same oblation: to Aditi belongs the opening, to Aditi the concluding (oblation); for Aditi is this (earth).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:3">4:5:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. To Pathy&acirc; Svasti he offers first (at the opening sacrifice): then the gods, through speech, saw their way in what was unknown to them, for by speech the confused becomes known. But now that it is known, he performs in the proper order.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:4">4:5:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. To Agni he offers first, then to Soma, then to Savit<I>ri</I>, then to Pathy&acirc; Svasti, then to Aditi, Now Pathy&acirc; Svasti (the wishing of a 'happy journey')</p>

<p>is speech, and Aditi is this (earth): on her the gods thereby established speech, and thus established thereon speech speaks here.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:5">4:5:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. Thereupon he slaughters a barren an&ucirc;bandhy&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_902"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> cow for Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a. And this indeed is performed as a different sacrifice, and that an animal offering; for the Samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us form the end of the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:6">4:5:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. The reason why there is a barren cow for Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a is this. Whatever part of his (sacrifice)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_903"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who has offered is well-offered that part of his Mitra takes, and whatever is ill-offered that Varu<I>n</I>a takes.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:7">4:5:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. Then they say, 'What has become of the sacrificer?'--whatever well-offered part of his (sacrifice) Mitra here takes, that he now again surrenders to him, being pleased with this (cow); and whatever ill-offered part of his Varu<I>n</I>a takes, that indeed he makes well-offered for him, being pleased with this (cow), and surrenders it again to him. This forsooth is his own sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_904"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, his own merit.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:8">4:5:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. And again, why there is a barren cow for Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a. Now, when the gods caused the cast seed to spring,--there is that <I>s</I>astra called &Acirc;gnim&acirc;ruta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_905"></A><A HREF="#fn_902"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>: in connection therewith it is explained how</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_388"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 388</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the gods caused that seed to spring. From it the coals (a&#7749;g&acirc;ra) sprung, and from the coals the A&#7749;giras; and after that the other animals&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_906"></A><A HREF="#fn_903"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:9">4:5:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. Then the dust of the ashes which remained: therefrom the ass was produced,--hence when it is dusty anywhere, people say, 'A very place for asses, forsooth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_907"></A><A HREF="#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!' And when no sap whatever remained,--thence was produced that barren cow belonging to Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a; wherefore that (cow) does not bring forth, for from sap seed is produced, and from seed cattle. And because she was produced at the end, therefore she comes after the end of the sacrifice. Hence also a barren cow for Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a is the most proper here: if he cannot obtain a barren cow, it may also be a bullock&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_908"></A><A HREF="#fn_905"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:10">4:5:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. Then the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I> applied themselves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_909"></A><A HREF="#fn_906"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> a second time: thence the Vai<I>s</I>vadev&icirc; (cow) was produced; then the B&acirc;rhaspaty&acirc;: that is the end, for B<I>ri</I>haspati is the end.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:11">4:5:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. And whosoever gives a thousand or more</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (cows to the priests), he will slaughter all these;--indeed, everything is obtained, everything conquered by him who gives a thousand or more. Those (three) cows are everything, (when offered) thus in the proper order: first one to Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, then one to the All-gods, then one to B<I>ri</I>haspati.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:12">4:5:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. And those who perform a long sacrificial session, for a year or more, they will slaughter all these&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_910"></A><A HREF="#fn_907"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>;--indeed everything is obtained, everything conquered by those who perform a long sacrificial session, for a year or more: those (cows) are everything, (when offered) thus in the proper order.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:13">4:5:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. Thereupon he performs the Udavas&acirc;n&icirc;y&acirc; ish<I>t</I>i (completing oblation). He prepares a cake on five potsherds for Agni. Its invitatory and offering prayers are five-footed pa&#7749;ktis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_911"></A><A HREF="#fn_908"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. For at this time the sacrifice of him who has sacrificed is, as it were, exhausted in strength: it, as it were, passes away from him. Now all sacrifices are Agni, since all sacrifices are performed in him, the domestic sacrifices as well as others. He thus takes hold again of the sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice of his is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_390"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 390</FONT></A></p>  
<p>not exhausted in strength, and does not pass away from him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:14">4:5:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. The reason why the cake is one on five potsherds, and the invitatory and offering prayers are pa&#7749;ktis (verses of five feet), is that the sacrifice is fivefold. He thus takes hold again of the sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice of his is not exhausted in strength, and does not pass away from him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:15">4:5:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. The priests&#8217; fee for it is gold; for this is a sacrifice to Agni, and gold is Agni's seed: therefore the priests&#8217; fee is gold. Or an ox, for such a one is of Agni's nature as regards its shoulder, since its shoulder (bearing the yoke) is as if burnt by fire.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:1:16">4:5:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. Or&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_912"></A><A HREF="#fn_909"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he takes ghee in five ladlings, and offers it with the verse to Vish<I>n</I>u (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. V, 38), 'Stride thou widely, O Vish<I>n</I>u, make wide room for our abode! drink the ghee, thou born of ghee, and speed the lord of the sacrifice ever onwards, Hail!' For Vish<I>n</I>u is the sacrifice: he thus takes hold again of the sacrifice, and thus his sacrifice is not exhausted in strength, and does not pass away from him. And let him on this occasion give as much as he can afford, for no offering, they say, should be without a Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;. When this Udavas&acirc;n&icirc;y&acirc;-ish<I>t</I>i is completed, he offers the (ordinary) evening (milk) offering&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_913"></A><A HREF="#fn_910"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,--but the morning offering at its proper time.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_905"></A><A HREF="sbe2660.htm#fr_908">388:3</A> K&acirc;ty. X, 9,15 allows, in lieu of the animal offering, an oblation of clotted curds (payasy&acirc; or &acirc;miksh&acirc;). See also II, 4, 2, 1 4.</P>

It is to be performed somewhere north of the sacrificial ground on a fire produced by the churning of the ara<I>n</I>is or (pairs of) churning-sticks, with which the priests have previously 'lifted' their several fires.
