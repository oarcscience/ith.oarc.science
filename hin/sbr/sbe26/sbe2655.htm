Savit<I>ri</I>, forsooth, is his&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_836"></A><A HREF="#fn_833"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> mind: therefore he draws the S&acirc;vitra cup. And, forsooth, Savit<I>ri</I> is his breath (vital air);--when he draws the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u cup, then he puts into him that vital air in front; and when he draws the S&acirc;vitra cup, then he puts into him that vital air behind: thus those two vital airs on both sides are beneficial (or, put into him), both that which is above and that which is below.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:2">4:4:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. And the sacrifice, forsooth, is the seasons, the year. There, at the morning feast, they are overtly attended to, in that he draws the cups for the seasons; and at the midday feast they are covertly attended to, in that he takes the Marutvat&icirc;ya libations by means of the two Ritu vessels&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_837"></A><A HREF="#fn_834"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Now here (at the evening feast) they neither draw any libation expressly for the seasons, nor is any libation taken with the two Ritu vessels.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:3">4:4:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. But Savit<I>ri</I>, forsooth, is he that burns yonder (the sun); and he indeed is all the seasons: thus the seasons, the year, are overtly attended to at the evening feast,--for this reason he draws the S&acirc;vitra cup.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:4">4:4:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. He draws it with the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u vessel. For Savit<I>ri</I> is his mind, and the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u is his breath: therefore he draws it with the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u vessel; or with the Antary&acirc;ma vessel, for that is one and the same, since the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u and Antary&acirc;ma are the out-breathing and in-breathing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_838"></A><A HREF="#fn_835"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:5">4:4:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. He draws it from the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a graha; for Savit<I>ri</I> is his mind, and the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a is his body (or self): he thus puts the mind into the body. Savit<I>ri</I> is his breath, and the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a is his body: he thus puts the breath into the body.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:6">4:4:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. He thus draws it therefrom with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 6; Rig-veda VI, 71, 6), 'Bring thou forth boons for us this day, O Savitar, boons to-morrow, boons day by day: O God, through this our prayer may we be sharers of boons, of a good and plenteous abode!--Thou art taken with a support!--Thou art Savit<I>ri</I>'s joy-giver, thou art a joy-giver: give me joy! speed the sacrifice; speed the lord of the sacrifice to (receive) his share!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:7">4:4:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. Having drawn it, he does not deposit it; for Savit<I>ri</I> is his (Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a's) mind, and hence this mind is restless. And Savit<I>ri</I> is his breath: hence this breath passes to and fro unrestingly. He then says (to the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the god Savit<I>ri</I>!' Having called for the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_359"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 359</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>, he says, 'Prompt (the Hot<I>ri</I> to recite the offering prayer) to the god Savit<I>ri</I>!' The Vasha<I>t</I> having been pronounced, he offers. He (the Hot<I>ri</I>) pronounces no Anuvasha<I>t</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_839"></A><A HREF="#fn_836"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,--for Savit<I>ri</I> is his mind,--'lest he should consign his mind to the fire;' and Savit<I>ri</I> being his breath,--'lest he should consign his breath to the fire.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:8">4:4:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. Then with the (same) vessel, without drinking therefrom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_840"></A><A HREF="#fn_837"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he draws the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva graha. The reason why he draws the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva graha with the (same) vessel, without drinking therefrom, is this: on the S&acirc;vitra graha he (the Hot<I>ri</I>) pronounces no Anuvasha<I>t</I>, and it is therefrom that he is about to draw the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva graha,--thus it is by means of the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva that it becomes supplied with the Anuvasha<I>t</I> for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:9">4:4:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. And further why he draws the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva graha. Savit<I>ri</I>, forsooth, is his rind, and the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I> (All-gods, or all the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_841"></A><A HREF="#fn_838"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>) are everything here: he thus makes everything here subservient and obedient to the mind, and hence everything here is subservient and obedient to the mind.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:10">4:4:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. And again why he draws the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva graha. Savit<I>ri</I>, forsooth, is his breath, and the All-gods are everything here: he thereby puts the out-breathing and in-breathing into everything here, and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_360"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 360</FONT></A></p>  
<p>thus the out-breathing and in-breathing become beneficial (or put) in everything here.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:11">4:4:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. And again why he draws the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva graha. The evening feast belongs to the All-gods: thus indeed it is called on the part of the S&acirc;man, in that the evening feast is called Vai<I>s</I>vadeva on the part of the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_842"></A><A HREF="#fn_839"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and in the same way on the part of the Ya<I>g</I>us, by way of preparatory rite, when he draws that Mah&acirc;-vai<I>s</I>vadeva graha.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:12">4:4:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. He draws it from the P&ucirc;tabh<I>ri</I>t; for the P&ucirc;tabh<I>ri</I>t belongs to the All-gods, because therefrom they draw (Soma juice) for the gods, therefrom for men, therefrom for the Fathers: hence the P&ucirc;tabh<I>ri</I>t belongs to the All-gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:13">4:4:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. He draws it without a puroru<I>k</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_843"></A><A HREF="#fn_840"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for he draws it for the All-gods, and the All-gods are everything, the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> and Ya<I>g</I>us and S&acirc;man; and even in that he draws it for the All-gods, thereby it becomes supplied with a puroru<I>k</I> for him: therefore he draws it without a puroru<I>k</I>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:14">4:4:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. He thus draws it therefrom with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 8), 'Thou art taken with a support: thou art well-guarded, well-established,'--for well-guarded and well-established is the breath,--'homage to the great bull!'--the great bull is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (the lord of creatures): 'homage to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati,' he thereby means to say.--'Thee to the All-gods! this is thy womb,--thee to the All-gods!' Therewith he</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_361"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 361</FONT></A></p>  
<p>deposits it; for it is for the All-gods that he draws it. Thereupon he goes (to the Sadas) and sits down (in front of the Hot<I>ri</I>) with his face to the east&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_844"></A><A HREF="#fn_841"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:15">4:4:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. And when he (the Hot<I>ri</I>) recites this (verse), 'With one and ten for thine own sake, with two and twenty for offering, with three and thirty for up-bearing (the sacrifice to the gods); with thy teams, O V&acirc;yu, do thou here unloose them!'--during (the recitation of) this verse to V&acirc;yu the drinking-vessels are unyoked&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_845"></A><A HREF="#fn_842"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for beasts have V&acirc;yu for their leader; and V&acirc;yu</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_362"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 362</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (wind) is breath, since it is by means of the breath that beasts move about.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:16">4:4:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. Now once on a time he went away from the gods with the beasts. The gods called after him at the morning pressing,--he returned not. They called after him at the midday pressing,--but he returned not. They called after him at the evening pressing.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:17">4:4:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. Being about to return, he said, 'If I were to return to you, what would be my reward? '--'By thee these vessels would be yoked, and by thee they would be unloosed!'--Hence those vessels are yoked by that (V&acirc;yu), when he (the Adhvaryu) draws the (cups) for Indra and V&acirc;yu and so forth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_846"></A><A HREF="#fn_843"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And now those vessels are unloosed by him, when he says, 'with thy teams, O V&acirc;yu, do thou here unloose them;'--teams mean cattle: thus he unlooses those vessels by means of cattle.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:1:18">4:4:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. Now, had he returned at the morning pressing--the morning pressing belonging to the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, and the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; being the priesthood&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_847"></A><A HREF="#fn_844"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>--then cattle would have come to be with priests only. And had he returned at the midday pressing--the midday pressing belonging to Indra, and Indra being the nobility--cattle would have come to be with nobles only. But in that he returned at the evening pressing--the evening pressing belonging to the All-gods, and the All-gods being everything here--therefore there are cattle everywhere here.</p>
