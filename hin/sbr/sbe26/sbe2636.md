### NINTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:1">3:9:1:1</span></span>1. Now
Pra*g*âpati (the lord of creatures), having created living beings, felt
himself as it were exhausted <span id="fr_548"></span>[4](#fn_546). The
creatures turned away from him; the creatures <span
id="fr_549"></span>[5](#fn_547) did not abide with him for his joy and
food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:2">3:9:1:2</span></span>2. He
thought within him, 'I have exhausted

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

myself, and the object for which <span id="fr_550"></span>[1](#fn_548) I
have created has not been accomplished: my creatures have turned away
from me, the creatures have not abode with me for my joy and food.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:3">3:9:1:3</span></span>3.
Pra*g*âpati thought within him, 'How can I again strengthen myself: the
creatures might then return to me; the creatures might abide with me for
my joy and food!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:4">3:9:1:4</span></span>4. He
went on praising and toiling, desirous of creatures (or progeny). He
beheld that set of eleven (victims). By offering therewith Pra*g*âpati
again strengthened himself; the creatures returned to him, his creatures
abode for his joy and food. By offering he truly became better.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:5">3:9:1:5</span></span>5.
Therefore, then, let him offer with the set of eleven (victims), for
thus he truly strengthens himself by offspring and cattle the creatures
turn unto him, the creatures abide with him for his joy and food;--he
truly becomes better by offering: therefore, then, let him offer with
the set of eleven (victims).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:6">3:9:1:6</span></span>6. In the
first place he seizes <span id="fr_551"></span>[2](#fn_549) a victim for
Agni. For Agni is the head, the progenitor of the gods, he is the lord
of creatures: and thereby the sacrificer truly becomes Agni's own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:7">3:9:1:7</span></span>7. Then
one for Sarasvatî. For Sarasvatî is speech: by speech Pra*g*âpati then
again strengthened himself; speech turned unto him, speech he made
subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by speech,
and speech turns unto him, and he makes speech subject to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:8">3:9:1:8</span></span>8. Then
one for Soma. For Soma is food: by

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

food Pra*g*âpati then again strengthened himself; food turned unto him,
and he made food subject to himself. And so does this one now become
strong by food; food turns unto him, and he makes food subject to
himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:9">3:9:1:9</span></span>9. And as
to why it comes after that for Sarasvatî,--Sarasvatî is speech, and Soma
is food: he who is incomplete by (having only) speech, now becomes
indeed an eater of food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:10">3:9:1:10</span></span>10.
Then one for Pûshan. For Pûshan means cattle; by means of cattle
Pra*g*âpati then again strengthened himself; cattle turned unto him, he
made cattle subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong
by means of cattle; the cattle turn unto him, and he makes the cattle
subject to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:11">3:9:1:11</span></span>11.
Then one for B*ri*haspati. For B*ri*haspati means the priesthood
(brahman); by means of the priesthood Pra*g*âpati then again
strengthened himself; the priesthood turned unto him, he made the
priesthood subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by
means of the Brahman; the priesthood turns unto him, he makes the
priesthood subject to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:12">3:9:1:12</span></span>12. And
as to why it comes after that for Pûshan,--Pûshan means cattle, and
B*ri*haspati the priesthood; hence the Brâhma*n*a (priest) has the most
power over beasts, because they are placed in front (are protected) by
him <span id="fr_552"></span>[1](#fn_550), because they are placed at
the head (or in his mouth); therefore

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

having given all that, he walks clad in sheepskin <span
id="fr_553"></span>[1](#fn_551).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:13">3:9:1:13</span></span>13.
Then one for the Vi*s*ve devâ*h*. For the All-gods mean everything (or
the All); with everything Pra*g*âpati then again strengthened himself;
everything turned unto him, and he made everything subject to him. And
so does this one now become strong by everything; everything turns to
him, and he makes everything subject to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:14">3:9:1:14</span></span>14. And
as to why it comes after that for B*ri*haspati,--B*ri*haspati means the
priesthood, and the All-gods this All; he then makes the priesthood the
head of this All; wherefore the Brahman is the head of this All.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:15">3:9:1:15</span></span>15.
Then one for Indra. For Indra means power (indriya) and vigour; by power
and vigour Pra*g*âpati then again strengthened himself; power and vigour
turned unto him, and he made power and vigour subject to himself. And so
does this one now become strong by means of power and vigour; power and
vigour turn to him, and he makes power and vigour subject to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:16">3:9:1:16</span></span>16. And
as to why it comes after that for the All-gods,--Indra is the nobility,
and the All-gods are the clans (people); he thus places the food before
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:17">3:9:1:17</span></span>17.
Then one for the Maruts. For the Maruts mean the clans, and a clan means
abundance; with abundance Pra*g*âpati then again strengthened himself;
abundance turned unto him, and he made abundance subject to himself. And
so does this one now become strong by abundance; abundance

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

turns unto him, and he makes abundance subject to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:18">3:9:1:18</span></span>18. And
as to why it comes after that for Indra,--Indra is the nobility, and the
All-gods are the clans, and the Maruts are the clans; he thus guards the
nobility by the clan, and hence the nobility here is on both sides
guarded by the clan.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:19">3:9:1:19</span></span>19.
Then one for Indra and Agni. For Agni means penetrating brilliance, and
Indra means power and vigour; with these two energies Pra*g*âpati then
again strengthened himself; both energies turned unto him, and he made
both energies subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong
by both these energies; both energies turn unto him, and he makes both
energies subject to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:20">3:9:1:20</span></span>20.
Then one for Savit*ri*. For Savit*ri* is the impeller (prasavit*ri*) of
the gods; and so all those wishes become accomplished for him, impelled
as they are by Savit*ri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:21">3:9:1:21</span></span>21.
Then finally he seizes one for Varu*n*a; thereby he delivers him (the
sacrificer) from every noose of Varu*n*a, from every (guilt) against
Varu*n*a <span id="fr_554"></span>[1](#fn_552),

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:22">3:9:1:22</span></span>22.
Hence if there be eleven sacrificial stakes, let him bind Agni's
(victim) to the one opposite the fire; and let them lead up the others
one by one in the proper order.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:23">3:9:1:23</span></span>23. But
if there be eleven victims <span id="fr_555"></span>[2](#fn_553), let
them only immolate at the stake that for Agni, and after that the others
in the proper order.

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:24">3:9:1:24</span></span>24.
When they lead them northwards, they lead the one for Agni first, and
then the others in the proper order.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:25">3:9:1:25</span></span>25.
When they throw them down, they throw down first the one for Agni, as
the southernmost; then the others after leading them round northwards in
the proper order.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:26">3:9:1:26</span></span>26.
When they perform (offerings) with the omenta, they perform first with
the omentum of Agni's (victim); then with those of the others in the
proper order.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:1:27">3:9:1:27</span></span>27.
When they perform with those (chief oblations), they perform first with
that to Agni; then with the others in the proper order.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_546"></span>[217:4](sbe2636.htm#fr_548) Riri*k*âna*h*, lit.
'emptied,' as âpyây means 'to fill.'

<span id="fn_547"></span>[217:5](sbe2636.htm#fr_549) 'Pra*g*â' has
likewise here the meaning of 'people, subjects, constituting the power
or glory (*s*rî) of the king'.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[218:1](sbe2636.htm#fr_550) For 'asmâ u kâmâya'
we ought to read 'yasmâ u kâmâya,' with Sâya*n*a and the Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[218:2](sbe2636.htm#fr_551) Âlabh, to touch,
seize, is a euphemistic term for immolating.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[219:1](sbe2636.htm#fr_552) Purâhitâ*h*
(pura-âhitâ*h*, Kâ*n*va rec.) has both the general meaning of 'put
before him (as food)' and that of 'being placed next in order before
him.'

<span id="fn_551"></span>[220:1](sbe2636.htm#fr_553) 'Since the lordship
over cattle belongs to the Brahman, therefore (the sacrificer) having
given all his property to the Brahmans,' &c, Sây.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[221:1](sbe2636.htm#fr_554) Varu*n*yâd evaitat
sarvasmât kilbishâd enaso ’ntato varu*n*apâ*s*ât pra*g*â*h*
pramu*ñk*ati, Kâ*n*va rec.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[221:2](sbe2636.htm#fr_555) That is, if there
be eleven victims and only one stake, in that case Agni's victim is tied
to the stake, and each succeeding victim is tied to the neck of the
preceding one. Kâty. VIII, 8, 28.
