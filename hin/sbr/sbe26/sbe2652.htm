The <I>S</I>ukra and Manthin grahas he draws first, for thereby the Soma feast comes to be supplied with pure Soma (<I>s</I>ukra). Thereupon the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a, for that (cup) is drawn at all (three) feasts. Then the Marutvat&icirc;ya cup; then the Ukthya, for here also there are songs of praise (Uktha)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_789"></A><A HREF="#fn_786"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

These, then, are five grahas he draws; for that midday Pavam&acirc;na chant is a thunderbolt: hence it is a fifteenfold five-hymned chant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_790"></A><A HREF="#fn_787"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for the thunderbolt is fifteenfold&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_791"></A><A HREF="#fn_788"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. He is so by means of these five grahas (cups of Soma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_792"></A><A HREF="#fn_789"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>): for five are these fingers, and with the fingers he hurls (the thunderbolt).</p>

Wherefore now also, when they (the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s) chant the midday Pavam&acirc;na, and safety and peace are secured, the dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;s are led forth. And so, forsooth, does he now by means of those five cups of Soma hurl the thunderbolt at the wicked, hateful enemy, and having smitten V<I>ri</I>tra, the wicked, and safety and peace being</p>

<p>secured, he leads forth the dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;s. This is why he draws those five cups.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:3:6">4:3:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. Then as to why he draws the Marutvat&icirc;ya cups. Now this, the midday pressing feast, is Indra's special (nishkevalya) feast: thereby he strove to smite V<I>ri</I>tra, thereby he strove to vanquish him. But the Maruts, having on that account&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_794"></A><A HREF="#fn_791"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> withdrawn, were standing on an A<I>s</I>vattha tree&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_795"></A><A HREF="#fn_792"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (Ficus Religiosa). Now Indra is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people, and through the people the noble becomes strong: therefore the two Ritu cups (they say)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_796"></A><A HREF="#fn_793"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> may be of a<I>s</I>vattha wood; but in reality they are of k&acirc;rshmarya wood.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:3:7">4:3:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. Indra called on them, saying, 'Do ye join me that with you as my force I may smite V<I>ri</I>tra!' They said, 'What will be our (reward) then?' He drew those two Marutvat&icirc;ya cups for them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:3:8">4:3:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. They said, 'Having put aside this one (cup) for our vigour, we will join thee.' Having accordingly put it aside for their vigour&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_797"></A><A HREF="#fn_794"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, they joined him. But Indra sought to obtain it, thinking, 'They have come to me after putting aside their vigour.'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_335"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 335</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:3:9">4:3:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. He said, 'Do ye join me with vigour!'--'Then draw a third cup for us;' they said. He drew a third cup for them, with, 'Thou art taken with a support,--thee for the vigour of the Maruts!' They then joined him with vigour,--and he conquered with them, and smote V<I>ri</I>tra with them;--for Indra is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people, and through the people the noble becomes strong. Hence he now bestows that strength on the nobility, and therefore he draws the Marutvat&icirc;ya cups.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:3:10">4:3:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. Let him draw them for Indra Marutvat (accompanied by the Maruts), and not for the Maruts likewise. For were he also to draw cups for the Maruts, he would make the people refractory to the nobility. He thus assigns to the Maruts a share therein after Indra, whereby he makes the people subservient and obedient to the nobility: therefore let him draw the cups for Indra Marutvat, and not for the Maruts likewise.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:3:11">4:3:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. But he was afraid of their desertion,--'Lest they should desert me, lest they should take to some other (party)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_798"></A><A HREF="#fn_795"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,' so thinking, he by that (share in the libation) made them unwilling to desert him. This is why he should draw the grahas for Indra Marutvat.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:3:12">4:3:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. He draws them with the two vessels of the seasons, for the year, the sacrifice, means the seasons. There, at the morning Soma feast, they are overtly attended to, in that he draws the grahas for the seasons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_799"></A><A HREF="#fn_796"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and now they are covertly attended</p>

He draws (the first) from that (stream of Soma)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_800"></A><A HREF="#fn_797"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VII, 35; Rig-veda III, 51, 7), 'O Indra, leader of the Maruts, drink thou the Soma here, as thou drankest of the liquor at (the sacrifice of) the Son of Sary&acirc;ti: by thy guidance, in thy protection, O Lord, do the wise serve thee with good offerings!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Marutvat!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Marutvat!'</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Rig-veda III, 47, 5], 'The mighty bull, followed by the Maruts, the bountiful, divine ruler Indra,--him, the all-subduing, the terrible bestower of victory, do we now invoke for new favour.--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Marutvat!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Marutvat!'--with Thou art</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_338"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 338</FONT></A></p>  
<p>taken with a support: thee for the strength of the Maruts!' he draws the third cup.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:3:15">4:3:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. Thereupon he draws the M&acirc;hendra cup. For Indra was then bound up with evil, in the shape of the people, the Maruts; as one might, for the sake of victory, eat from the same vessel with the people&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_802"></A><A HREF="#fn_799"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> so it was when they drew a cup for him in common with the Maruts.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:3:16">4:3:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. When all was conquered and free from danger and injury, the gods plucked him from out of all evil--even as one might pluck out a reed from its sheath--when they drew the cup for the Great Indra. And even as the reed becomes leafless, so is he thereby freed from all evil, when one draws the M&acirc;hendra cup.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:3:17">4:3:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. And again, why he draws the M&acirc;hendra cup. Before the slaughter of V<I>ri</I>tra, he was indeed Indra; but when he had slain V<I>ri</I>tra, he became the Great--Indra, even as one who has conquered all around, becomes a Great King (mah&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>a): therefore he draws the M&acirc;hendra cup. And, moreover, he forsooth make's him great for the slaughter of V<I>ri</I>tra therefore also he draws the M&acirc;hendra cup. He draws it in the <I>S</I>ukra vessel, for bright (<I>s</I>ukra) and great indeed is he (the sun) that burns yonder: therefore he draws it in the <I>S</I>ukra vessel.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:3:18">4:3:3:18</A></FONT></span>18. He thus draws it from that (Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a or P&ucirc;tabh<I>ri</I>t), with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VII, 39; Rig-veda VI, 19, 1), 'Great is Indra and hero-like, gladdening the people, of double stature and unimpaired in power. For our sake he waxed strong for heroic deed,--great and broad was he, and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_339"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 339</FONT></A></p>  
<p>well-shapen by the shapers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_803"></A><A HREF="#fn_800"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Mahendra!'--with 'This is thy womb: thee to Mahendra!' he deposits it; for it is indeed for the Great Indra that he draws it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:3:19">4:3:3:19</A></FONT></span>19. And having bespoken (the chant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_804"></A><A HREF="#fn_801"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>), he says this speech,--'Pressers, press ye! make the mortars</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_340"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 340</FONT></A></p>  
<p>resound! Agn&icirc;dh, stir the sour milk! be thou mindful of Soma's (pap)!' It is for the evening's press-feast that those pressers press out (the Soma juice), for the evening feast they make the mortars resound, for the evening feast the Agn&icirc;dh stirs the sour milk, for the evening feast he boils the pap for Soma. For these two press-feasts, the morning feast and the midday feast, are indeed rich in pure Soma, are rich in juice; but that third press-feast is emptied of the pure Soma. Hence he forms it from out of this midday feast; and thus that third press-feast becomes for him rich in pure Soma, rich in juice: this is why he now speaks that speech.</p>

The Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup with the Nigr&acirc;bhy&acirc; (vasat&icirc;var&icirc;) water having been handed to the sacrificer, and the fillet or band (ush<I>n</I>&icirc;sha) with which the Soma-plants are tied together, to the Gr&acirc;vastut, the pressing is performed in the same way as the 'great pressing,' at <A NAME="page_332"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 332</FONT></A> the Pr&acirc;ta<I>h</I>savana (see <A HREF="sbe2640.htm#page_256">p. 256</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2641.htm#fn_619">1</A>). Meanwhile the Gr&acirc;vastut takes the band, and winds it thrice round his head and face from left to right. And whenever Soma-stalks are taken out for pressing he extols the stones by chanting the Gr&acirc;va-stotra or 'praise of the stones.' According to &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>r. V, 12; Ait. Br. VI, 7, 2, this chant consists of the verses Rig-veda I, 24, 3; V, 81, 1; VIII, 81, 1; VIII, 1, 1, followed by the hymn X, 94, ascribed to the serpent <I>Ri</I>shi Arbuda. Before the last verse of this hymn he inserts the hymns X, 76 and X, 175, (ascribed to the serpents <I>G</I>aratkar<I>n</I>a and Arbuda respectively); and either before, or between, or after these two hymns he throws in the p&acirc;vam&acirc;n&icirc;<I>h</I> (Rig-veda IX) according to requirement, till the pressing is completed, or the libations are to be drawn, when having wound up with the last verse of the first Arbuda hymn, he makes over the band to the sacrificer. The five cups mentioned in <a href="sbe2652.htm#4:3:3:2">paragraph 2</A> are filled from the stream of Soma flowing from the Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup into the Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a; the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a (<A HREF="sbe2647.htm#page_294">p. 294</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2647.htm#fn_708">2</A>) however being taken (in the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a sth&acirc;l&icirc; or bowl) from that and two other streams, poured by the Unnet<I>ri</I> from the &Acirc;dhavan&icirc;ya, and by the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> from some vessel containing the Soma previously kept in the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a sth&acirc;l&icirc;.</P>

These are chanted in such a way as to produce five S&acirc;man hymns (i.e. a hymn of three verses), viz. the g&acirc;yatr&icirc; triplet is chanted twice, in the G&acirc;yatra and &Acirc;mah&icirc;yava tunes;--the b<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;-satob<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; couplet is likewise chanted twice, in the Raurava and Yaudh&acirc;<I>g</I>aya tunes, the two verses being as usual (by the repetition of certain p&acirc;das) made into three.

On the present occasion only one Marutvat&icirc;ya cup is drawn and deposited on the mound (khara).

Thereupon the Adhvaryu calls on the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a to pronounce the invitatory prayer to Indra Marutvat (viz. Rig-veda III, 51, 7), 'O Indra, attended by the Maruts, here drink the Soma,' &amp;c., followed by the order (praisha), 'Let the Hot<I>ri</I> pronounce the offering prayer to Indra Marutvat!' <A NAME="page_337"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 337</FONT></A> The Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> now draws a second Marutvat&icirc;ya cup in the other Ritu-p&acirc;tra. The offering prayer (Rig-veda III, 47, 2, 'United with the host of Maruts, O Indra, drink the Soma, O wise hero!' &amp;c.) having meanwhile been pronounced by the Hot<I>ri</I>, the Adhvaryu makes libations from the first cup at the Vasha<I>t</I> and Anuvasha<I>t</I>. Then pouring the remains of the juice into some other vessel, to be taken to the Sadas, he enters the Havirdh&acirc;na and draws the third Marutvat&icirc;ya graha with the cup just emptied. Having deposited it, he betakes himself to. the Sadas to drink with the Hot<I>ri</I> the remains of the first libation. Thereupon the Hot<I>ri</I> recites the Marutvat&icirc;ya <I>S</I>astra.</p>  
<p>The Marutvat&icirc;ya Sastra consists of the following parts. After the summons (&acirc;h&acirc;va) to the Adhvaryu, and the response (pratigara) of the latter, the Hot<I>ri</I> intones the</p>  
<p>Pratipad (opening triplet), Rig-veda VIII, 57, 1-3, followed by the Anu<I>k</I>ara (sequel), VIII, 2, 1-3.</p>  
<p>Then the Indranihava prag&acirc;tha (VIII, 53, 5) and the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>aspatya prag&acirc;tha (I, 40, 5).</p>  
<p>Then follow the three Dh&acirc;yy&acirc;s (complementary verses), III, 20, 4; I, 91, 2; I, 64, 6; and the Marutvat&icirc;ya prag&acirc;tha, VIII, 89, 3, succeeded by the hymn X, 73, the chief part of the <I>S</I>astra, in the middle of which (after the sixth verse), the Nivid ('Let us sing, Om! may Indra with the Maruts drink of the Soma,' &amp;c.) is inserted.</p>  
<p>Having recited the last verse (paridh&acirc;n&icirc;y&acirc; or closing verse) of the hymn, he concludes the <I>S</I>astra by the Ukthav&icirc;rya, 'Praise has been sung to Indra who hears thee!' Thereupon the offering prayer III, 47, 4 is pronounced, and libations are made, both at the Vasha<I>t</I> and Anuvasha<I>t</I>, by the Adhvaryu from the third, and after him each time, by the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> from the second graha.</p>  
<p>The priests having drank in the Sadas the Soma remaining from the grahas and in the <I>k</I>amasas, the M&acirc;hendra cup is drawn.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_799"></A><A HREF="sbe2652.htm#fr_802">338:1</A> That is, as a chief, or lord, might do so with a clansman (vai<I>s</I>yena, K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text); or as the master of a house with his servants.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_800"></A><A HREF="sbe2652.htm#fr_803">339:1</A> Or, according to Ludwig, 'rendered favourable by the performers (priests).'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_801"></A><A HREF="sbe2652.htm#fr_804">339:2</A> That is, the (first) P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra, consisting of the Rathantara-s&acirc;m an, S&acirc;mav. II, 30-31. For the way in which the two verses are manipulated (by repetition of the last p&acirc;da of the first, and of the second p&acirc;da of the second verse), so as to yield a three-versed choral, see Haug, Ait. Br. II, p. 198; Weber, Ind. Stud. VIII, p. 25. These chants derive their name from the circumstance that the S&acirc;mans employed in them are capable of being used as 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>as,' that is, of being chanted twice with another S&acirc;man inserted between them,--or, to speak symbolically, to serve as the womb for the reception of an embryo. For this purpose the Rathantara and B<I>ri</I>hat S&acirc;mans are chiefly used. See note on <a href="sbe2663.htm#4:5:4:13">IV, 5, 4, 13</A>. Whenever the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>as are chanted in this way (which they are not at the ordinary Agnish<I>t</I>oma), it is chiefly at this very place in the Soma performance, at the midday libation. The chant is succeeded by the recitation, by the Hot<I>ri</I>, of the Nishkevalya <I>S</I>astra, consisting of the following parts. The &Acirc;h&acirc;va (and pratigara) is followed by the Stotriya (Rig-veda VII, 32, 22-23, identical with the Rathantara) and Anur&ucirc;pa (VIII, 3, 7-8) prag&acirc;thas; then a dh&acirc;yy&acirc;, X, 74,.6; the S&acirc;ma-prag&acirc;tha, VIII, 3, 1, and the hymn (to Indra) I, 32, with the Nivid inserted in the middle (after the eighth verse). Finally the Hot<I>ri</I> pronounces the Ukthav&icirc;rya, and the offering prayer, VII, 22, 1, after which the M&acirc;hendra libation is poured into the fire.</p>  
<p>Then follows the distribution of the Ukthya graha among the three assistants of the Hot<I>ri</I> and the recitation of their (nishkevalya) <I>s</I>astras--each preceded by a P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra [S&acirc;mav. II, 32-34 (chanted to the V&acirc;madevya-s&acirc;man); 35-36 (Naudhasa); 37-38 (K&acirc;leya) respectively]--as at the conclusion of the morning performance; see <A HREF="sbe2647.htm#page_295">p. 295</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2647.htm#fn_711">2</A>. Thereupon he addresses the above summons to the respective priests, for the preparations necessary for the evening pressing.</P>
