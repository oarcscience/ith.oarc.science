### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:1">4:4:5:1</span></span>1. He now
betakes himself to the expiatory bath (avabh*ri*tha). The reason why he
betakes himself to the expiatory bath is this. What vital sap there has
been in him (Soma and the sacrificer), that (sap) of his he (the priest)
has produced (extracted) for the offerings. Now that body (of Soma, i.e.

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

the Soma-husks),--there is no sap in it; (yet) it is not to be cast
away: they take it down to the water and--water being sap--he puts that
sap into it. Thus he unites him with that sap, and thus he produces him
from it,--he (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the
sacrificer) <span id="fr_881"></span>[1](#fn_878): and because they take
it down (ava-h*ri* <span id="fr_882"></span>[2](#fn_879)) to the water,
therefore (the bath is called) avabh*ri*tha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:2">4:4:5:2</span></span>2. In the
first place he performs the Samish*t*aya*g*us offerings, for the
Samish*t*aya*g*us are the extreme end of the sacrifice. As soon as he
has performed the Samish*t*aya*g*us, they go together to the *k*âtvâla
(pit) with whatever he (the sacrificer) has about him <span
id="fr_883"></span>[3](#fn_880): both the black-deer's horn <span
id="fr_884"></span>[4](#fn_881) and the girdle he throws into the pit,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:3">4:4:5:3</span></span>3. With
(Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 23), 'Be thou nor adder nor viper!' Now when they take
the Soma-husks down to the water, that forsooth is the wishing of
'good-speed <span id="fr_885"></span>[5](#fn_882)!' to it, and this now
is the 'good-speed!' to him (the sacrificer); for snakes are like rope,
and snakes' haunts are like wells (pits), and there is as it were a feud
between men and snakes: 'Lest that should spring therefrom,' he thinks,
and therefore he says, 'Be thou nor adder nor viper!'

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:4">4:4:5:4</span></span>4. He
then makes (the sacrificer) say (Rig-veda I, 24, 8), 'Broad forsooth is
the path which king Varu*n*a hath made for the sun to walk
along,'--whereby he means to say, 'even as there is for the sun that
broad path, free from danger and injury, so may there be for me here a
broad path, free from danger and injury.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:5">4:4:5:5</span></span>5. 'For
the footless hath he made feet to put down <span
id="fr_886"></span>[1](#fn_883),' for, although he (the sun) is
footless, yet he is able to walk;--'And the forbidder is he of all that
woundeth the heart,'--thus he frees him from every guilt and evil of the
heart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:6">4:4:5:6</span></span>6. He
then says, 'Sing the Sâman!' or 'Speak the Sâman!' but let him rather
say 'Sing,' for they do sing the Sâman. The reason why he sings the
Sâman is that the evil spirits may not injure that body of his outside
the sacrifice, for the Sâman is a repeller of the evil spirits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:7">4:4:5:7</span></span>7. He
(the Prastot*ri*) sings a (verse) to Agni, for Agni is a repeller of the
evil spirits. He sings in the Ati*kh*andas; for this, the Ati*kh*andas,
is all the metres <span id="fr_887"></span>[2](#fn_884): therefore he
sings in the Ati*kh*andas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:8">4:4:5:8</span></span>8. He
sings, 'Agni burneth, Agni encountereth with flames,--Ahâva*h*!
Ahâva*h* <span id="fr_888"></span>[3](#fn_885)!' Thus he drives the evil
spirits away from here.

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:9">4:4:5:9</span></span>9. They
walk out (from the sacrificial ground) northwards, along the back of the
pit and the front side of the Âgnîdhra: then they proceed in whatever
direction the water is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:10">4:4:5:10</span></span>10.
Where there is a standing pool of flowing water, there let him (the
sacrificer) descend into the water--for whatsoever parts of flowing
water flow not, these are holden by Varu*n*a; and the expiatory bath
belongs to Varu*n*a--to free himself from Varu*n*a. But if he does not
find such, he may descend into any water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:11">4:4:5:11</span></span>11.
While he makes him descend into the water, he bids him say, 'Homage be
to Varu*n*a: downtrodden is Varu*n*a's snare!' thus he delivers him from
every snare of Varu*n*a, from every (infliction <span
id="fr_889"></span>[1](#fn_886)) of Varu*n*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:12">4:4:5:12</span></span>12.
Thereupon, taking ghee in four ladlings, and throwing down a
kindling-stick (on the water), he offers thereon, with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII,
24), 'The face of Agni, the waters, have I entered, escaping from the
power of demons, O son of the waters! In every homestead offer thou the
log, O Agni! let thy tongue dart forth towards the ghee,--Hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:13">4:4:5:13</span></span>13.
Now, once on a time, the gods made so much of Agni, as would go in <span
id="fr_890"></span>[2](#fn_887), enter the water, in order that the evil
spirits should not rise therefrom; for Agni is the repeller of evil
spirits. It is him he kindles by this kindling-stick and by this

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

oblation, thinking 'On the kindled (fire) will I offer to the gods!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:14">4:4:5:14</span></span>14.
Then, having taken ghee a second time in four ladlings, and having
called for the (Âgnîdhra's) *S*rausha*t*, he says, 'Pronounce the
offering prayer to the Kindling-sticks!' He offers four fore-offerings,
omitting that to the Barhis <span id="fr_891"></span>[1](#fn_888)--the
Barhis being offspring, and the expiatory bath belonging to
Varu*n*a--lest Varu*n*a should seize upon his offspring. This is why he
offers four fore-offerings, omitting that to the Barhis.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:15">4:4:5:15</span></span>15.
Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Varu*n*a. For whatever sap there
had been in him (Soma), that sap of his he has produced (extracted) for
the offerings. Now that body: there is no sap in it. But the cake is
sap: that sap he puts into it. Thus he unites him with that sap, and so
produces him from it,--he (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the
sacrificer): hence there is a cake on -one potsherd for Varu*n*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:16">4:4:5:16</span></span>16.
Having made an 'underlayer' of ghee (in the offering-spoon), he says,
while making the cuttings from the cake <span
id="fr_892"></span>[2](#fn_889), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to
Varu*n*a!' Here now some make two cuttings from the Soma-husks, but let
him not do so; for that (heap of husks) is an empty body, unfit for
offering. He makes two cuttings (from the cake) and bastes them once
with ghee, and anoints (replenishes the places whence) the cuttings
(have been made). Having called for the *S*rausha*t*, he says, 'Recite
the

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

offering prayer to Varu*n*a!' and offers as the Vasha*t* is uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:17">4:4:5:17</span></span>17.
Then, having made an underlayer of ghee, he says, while putting the
(remainder of the) cake (into the spoon), 'Recite the invitatory prayer
to Agni and Varu*n*a!' This is for (Agni) Svish*t*ak*ri*t <span
id="fr_893"></span>[1](#fn_890); and as to why he does not say 'To
Agni,' it is lest Varu*n*a might seize upon Agni. If before he has cut
twice from the Soma-husks, he now does so once, but if (he did) not, he
need not heed it. He then bastes it twice with butter on the upper side;
and having called for the *S*rausha*t*, he says, 'Recite the offering
prayer to Agni and Varu*n*a!' and offers as the Vasha*t* is uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:18">4:4:5:18</span></span>18. Now
these are six oblations; for there are six seasons in the year, and
Varu*n*a is the year: hence there are six oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:19">4:4:5:19</span></span>19.
This is the course of the Âdityas <span id="fr_894"></span>[2](#fn_891);
and these Ya*g*us, they say, belong to the Âdityas. Let (the Adhvaryu)
endeavour to perform as much of it as is his (the sacrificer's) wish.
And if the sacrificer tell him to do otherwise, then he should do
otherwise. He may also perform those same four fore-offerings,--omitting
that to the Barhis--two butter-portions, (the oblations of cake) to
Varu*n*a and Agni-Varu*n*a, and two after-offerings,--omitting the one
to the Barhis;--this makes ten. Now the virâ*g* consists

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

of ten syllables, and the sacrifice is virâ*g*: thus he makes the
sacrifice to be like the virâ*g*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:20">4:4:5:20</span></span>20.
This is the course of the Aṅgiras. Having performed the offerings either
way, (the Adhvaryu) makes the pot, in which the husks are, float with
(Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 25), 'In the ocean, in the waters, is thy heart (O
Soma)'--for the ocean is the waters, and water is sap: that sap he now
puts into him (Soma), and thus he unites him with that sap, and produces
him therefrom; and he (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the
sacrificer);--'May the plants and the waters unite with thee!'--thereby
he puts two kinds of sap into him, that which is in plants, and that
which is in water,--'that we may serve thee, O lord of the sacrifice, in
the singing of praises and the utterance of worship <span
id="fr_895"></span>[1](#fn_892), with Svâhâ!' Whatever is good in the
sacrifice, that he thereby puts into him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:21">4:4:5:21</span></span>21.
Thereupon, letting it go, he stands by it with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 26), 'Ye
divine waters, this is your child,'--for he (Soma) indeed is the child
of the waters,--'bear ye him, well-beloved, well-nourished!' he thereby
makes him over to the waters for protection--'This, O divine Soma, is
thine abode: thrive thou well therein, and thrive thou <span
id="fr_896"></span>[2](#fn_893) thoroughly!' whereby he means to say,
'Be thou therein for our happiness, and shield us from all inflictions!'

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:22">4:4:5:22</span></span>22. He
then immerses it with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 27), 'O laving bath, laving thou
glidest along: with the help of the gods may I wipe out the sin
committed against the gods; and with the help of the mortals that
committed against mortals!'--for the sin committed against the gods he
has indeed wiped out with the help of the gods, namely, with the help of
king Soma; and the sin committed against mortals he has wiped out with
the help of mortals, namely, by means of the animal victim and the
sacrificial cake--'Preserve me, O god, from injury from the
fiercely-howling (demon)!' whereby he means to say, 'Preserve me from
all inflictions!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:5:23">4:4:5:23</span></span>23.
Thereupon both (the sacrificer and his wife) having descended, bathe,
and wash each other's back. Having wrapped themselves in fresh
garments <span id="fr_897"></span>[1](#fn_894) they step out: even as a
snake casts its skin, so does he cast away all his sin,--there is not in
him even as much sin as there is in a toothless child. By the same way
by which they came out (from the sacrificial ground), they return
thither <span id="fr_898"></span>[2](#fn_895); and, having returned, he
puts a kindling-stick on the Âhavanîya (at the front hall-door) with,
'Thou art the kindler of the gods!' He thereby kindles the sacrificer
himself,

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

for along with the kindling of the gods the sacrificer is kindled <span
id="fr_899"></span>[1](#fn_896).

<span id="fn_878"></span>[379:1](sbe2659.htm#fr_881) ? That is, as the
Soma plants become juicy again, so the sacrificer has his vital sap or
spirit restored.

<span id="fn_879"></span>[379:2](sbe2659.htm#fr_882) Or, according to
the St. Petersburg Dictionary, 'they throw it into the water.'

<span id="fn_880"></span>[379:3](sbe2659.htm#fr_883) Or, whatever is
connected with Soma (?). According to Kâty. X, 8, 12, 19 the throne
(âsandî) and Audumbarî, as well as the Soma vessels, Dro*n*akala*s*a,
&c., are to be carried in the first place to the *k*âtvâla, and from
there to the water.

<span id="fn_881"></span>[379:4](sbe2659.htm#fr_884) See [III, 2, 1,
18](sbe2607.htm#3:2:1:18). The Pratiprasthât*ri* is silently to throw
after the lady's zone and peg (for scratching herself).

<span id="fn_882"></span>[379:5](sbe2659.htm#fr_885) For the
'svagâkâra,' see I, 8, 3, 11.

<span id="fn_883"></span>[380:1](sbe2659.htm#fr_886) Or, 'To the
footless he has given to put down his feet:' in either sense it seems to
be taken by the author of the Brâhma*n*a (and the St. Petersburg
Dictionary). Perhaps, however, 'apade' had better be taken, with
Mahîdhara (and Sâya*n*a?), in the sense of 'padarahite,' i.e. 'in the
trackless (ether) he caused him (the sun) to plant his feet.' Similarly
Ludwig, 'Im Ortlosen hat er sie die Füsse niedersetzen lassen.'

<span id="fn_884"></span>[380:2](sbe2659.htm#fr_887) 'Eshâ vai sarvam
ati yad ati*kh*anda*h*,' Kâ*n*va text. Ati*kh*andas, i.e. over-metre,
redundant metre, is the generic term for metres consisting of more than
forty-eight syllables.

<span id="fn_885"></span>[380:3](sbe2659.htm#fr_888) All the priests, as
well as the sacrificer, are to join in the <span id="page_381">p.
381</span> nidhana (finale, or concluding word of the Sâman). According
to Kâty. X, 8, 16, 17 the Sâman is chanted thrice, viz. in starting from
the *k*âtvâla, midway, and at the water-side.

<span id="fn_886"></span>[381:1](sbe2659.htm#fr_889) Or guilt against
Varu*n*a. See [p. 221](sbe2636.htm#page_221), note
[1](sbe2636.htm#fn_552).

<span id="fn_887"></span>[381:2](sbe2659.htm#fr_890) Agner yâvad vâ
yâvad vâ. Cf. [p. 371](sbe2657.htm#page_371), note
[3](sbe2657.htm#fn_862).

<span id="fn_888"></span>[382:1](sbe2659.htm#fr_891) For the usual five
prayâ*g*as, see I, 5, 3, 8-13.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[382:2](sbe2659.htm#fr_892) As a rule, cakes on
one potsherd are to be offered entire. The present cake, however, is to
be an exception, and the usual two portions are to be cut from it. See
part i, p. 192, note.

<span id="fn_890"></span>[383:1](sbe2659.htm#fr_893) See I, 7, 3, 7 seq.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[383:2](sbe2659.htm#fr_894) Professor Weber,
Ind. Stud. X, p. 393, refers us to XIV, 9, 4, 33, where it is stated
that the Vâ*g*asaneyin Adhvaryu has to study the Ya*g*us of the Âditya
*Ri*shi. One might also be inclined to think that, by 'Adityânâm ayanam'
and 'Aṅgirasâm ayanam' the author intended to connect the Agnish*t*oma
with the sacrificial sessions designated by those terms, for which see
Â*s*v. *S*r. XII, 1-2; Ait. Br. IV, 17, with Haug's notes.

<span id="fn_892"></span>[384:1](sbe2659.htm#fr_895) See part i, p. 249,
note 1.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[384:2](sbe2659.htm#fr_896) 'Vakshva' is by
Mahîdhara (and apparently by the author of the Brâhma*n*a) referred to
'vah;' by the St. Petersburg Dictionary to 'vas' for 'vatsva.' I have
referred it to 'vaksh.' The Kâ*n*va text reads, Pari *k*a vakshi *s*a*m*
*k*a vakshîti pari *k*a no gopâya *s*a*m* *k*a na edhîty evaitad âha.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[385:1](sbe2659.htm#fr_897) According to the
Mânava Sûtra, as quoted on Kâty. X, 9, 6, the sacrificer wraps himself
in the cloth in which the Soma stalks were tied (somopanahana), and his
wife in the outer cloth tied round the Soma bundle (paryâ*n*ahana). The
Soma vessels and implements are likewise thrown into the water.

<span id="fn_895"></span>[385:2](sbe2659.htm#fr_898) While going thither
they all mutter the Âmahîyâ verse, Rig-veda VIII, 48, 3, 'We have drunk
Soma, we have become immortal, we have gone to the light, we have
attained to the gods: what now can the enemy do unto us, what the guile,
O immortal, of the mortal?'

<span id="fn_896"></span>[386:1](sbe2659.htm#fr_899) The sacrificer sits
down behind the *s*âlâdvârya fire and spreads the black deer-skin over
his knees; the Adhvaryu then making an oblation of ghee from the
dipping-spoon.
