### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:1">3:6:2:1</span></span>1. The
Dhish*n*ya-hearths <span id="fr_394"></span>[4](#fn_392.md), forsooth, are
no other

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

than its (the sacrifice's) congeners <span
id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_393.md). They have the same marks, and those
which have the same marks are congeners; and these, then, are those
(corresponding limbs) of its trunk.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:2">3:6:2:2</span></span>2. Now
Soma was in heaven, and the gods were here on earth. The gods desired,
'Would that Soma might come to us; we might sacrifice with him, when
come.' They produced those two illusions, Supar*n*î and Kadrû <span
id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_394.md); Supar*n*î, forsooth, was Vâ*k*
(speech) <span id="fr_397"></span>[3](#fn_395.md), and Kadrû was this
(earth). They caused discord between them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:3">3:6:2:3</span></span>3. They
then disputed and said, 'Which of us shall spy furthest, shall win the
other <span id="fr_398"></span>[4](#fn_396.md).'--'So be it!' Kadrû then
said, 'Espy thou!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:4">3:6:2:4</span></span>4.
Supar*n*î said, 'On yonder shore of this ocean there stands a white
horse at a post, that I see; doest thou also see it?'--'I verily do!'
Then said Kadrû 'Its tail was just now hanging down; there, now the wind
tosses it, that I see.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:5">3:6:2:5</span></span>5. Now
when Supar*n*î said, 'On yonder shore of this ocean,' the ocean,
forsooth, is the altar, she thereby meant the altar; 'there stands a
white horse at a post,' the white horse, forsooth, is Agni, and the post
means the sacrificial stake. And when Kadrû said, 'Its tail was just now
hanging down;

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

there, now the wind tosses it, that I see;' this is nothing else than
the rope.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:6">3:6:2:6</span></span>6.
Supar*n*î then said, 'Come, let us now fly thither to know which of us
is the winner.' Kadrû said, 'Fly thou thither; thou wilt tell us, which
of us is the winner.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:7">3:6:2:7</span></span>7.
Supar*n*î then flew thither; and it was even as Kadrû had said. When she
had returned, she (Kadrû) said to her, 'Hast thou won, or I?'--'Thou!'
she replied. Such is the story called Supar*n*î-Kâdrava <span
id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_397.md).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:8">3:6:2:8</span></span>8. Then
said Kadrû, 'Verily I have won thine own self; yonder is Soma in the
heaven: fetch him hither for the gods, and thereby redeem thyself from
the gods <span id="fr_400"></span>[2](#fn_398.md)!'--'So be it!' She
brought forth the metres; and that Gâyatrî fetched Soma from heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:9">3:6:2:9</span></span>9. He was
enclosed between two golden cups <span id="fr_401"></span>[3](#fn_399.md);
sharp-edged they closed together at every twinkling of the eye; and
these two, forsooth, were Consecration and Penance. Those Gandharva
Soma-wardens watched over him; they are these hearths, these
fire-priests.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:10">3:6:2:10</span></span>10. She
tore off one of the two cups, and gave it to the gods,--this was
Consecration: therewith the gods consecrated themselves,

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:11">3:6:2:11</span></span>11. She
then tore off the second cup, and gave it to the gods,--this was
Penance: therewith the gods underwent penance, to wit the Upasads, for
the Upasads are penance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:12">3:6:2:12</span></span>12. She
took possession (â-*k*akhâda) <span id="fr_402"></span>[1](#fn_400.md) of
Soma by means of (a stick of) khadira wood (Acacia Catechu), whence (the
name) Khadira; and because she thereby took possession of him, therefore
the sacrificial stake and the wooden sword (sphya) are of khadira wood.

She then carried him off while he was under the charge of the
A*kh*âvâka, wherefore this A*kh*âvâka priest was excluded (from drinking
Soma).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:13">3:6:2:13</span></span>13.
Indra and Agni preserved him for the production of creatures, whence the
A*kh*âvâka priest belongs to Indra and Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:14">3:6:2:14</span></span>14.
Therefore the consecrated keep charge of the king (Soma), 'lest (the
Gandharvas) should carry him off.' Let him therefore guard him
diligently, for verily in whosesoever charge they carry him off, he is
excluded (from the Soma).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:15">3:6:2:15</span></span>15.
Wherefore the students guard their teacher, his house, and cattle, lest
he should be taken from them. Let him therefore guard him (Soma)
diligently in that place, for verily in whosesoever charge they carry
him off, he is excluded therefrom. By means of him Supar*n*î redeemed
herself from the gods; wherefore they say, 'He who has sacrificed shares
in the world of bliss.'

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:16">3:6:2:16</span></span>16.
Verily, even in being born, man, by his own self, is born as a debt
(owing) to death. And in that he sacrifices, thereby he redeems himself
from death, even as Supar*n*î then redeemed herself from the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:17">3:6:2:17</span></span>17. The
gods worshipped with him. Those Gandharva Soma-wardens came after him;
and having come up they said, 'Do ye let us share in the sacrifice,
exclude us not from the sacrifice; let there be for us also a share in
the sacrifice!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:18">3:6:2:18</span></span>18.
They said, 'What will there be for us, then?'--'Even as in yonder world
we have been his keepers, so also will we be his keepers here on earth!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:19">3:6:2:19</span></span>19. The
gods spake, 'So be it!' By saying, '(Here are) your Soma-wages . . .' he
assigns to them the price of the Soma <span
id="fr_403"></span>[1](#fn_401.md). They then said unto them, 'At the third
pressing an offering of ghee shall fall to your share, but not one of
Soma, for the Soma-draught has been taken from you, wherefore ye are not
worthy of a Soma-offering!' And accordingly, when he pours ghee on the
hearths by means of fagots <span id="fr_404"></span>[2](#fn_402.md), at the
evening libation, that same offering of ghee falls to their share, but
not one of Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:20">3:6:2:20</span></span>20.
'And what they will offer in the fire that will satiate you;' hence that
which they offer in the fire satiates them. 'And when they will move
about, holding the Soma over each <span id="fr_405"></span>[3](#fn_403.md),
that will satiate you;' hence when they move about, holding the Soma
over each (hearth), that satiates them.

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Wherefore let not
the Adhvaryu pass between <span id="fr_406"></span>[1](#fn_404.md) the
hearths, for the Adhvaryu carries the Soma, and they sit waiting for him
(Soma) with open mouths, and he would enter into their open mouths; and
either Agni would burn him, or else that god who rules over beasts
(Rudra) would seek after him; hence whenever the Adhvaryu should have
business in the hall, let him pass north of the Âgnîdhra shed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:21">3:6:2:21</span></span>21. Now
it is for the protection of Soma that those (hearths) are thrown up, to
wit the Âhavanîya in front (on the high altar), the Mâr*g*âlîya in the
south, and the Âgnîdhrîya in the north; and those that are in the Sadas
(protect him) from behind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:22">3:6:2:22</span></span>22.
They are in part raised <span id="fr_407"></span>[2](#fn_405.md), in part
they are assigned <span id="fr_408"></span>[3](#fn_406.md). And, in truth,
they themselves insisted thereon, saying, 'They shall in part raise us,
and in part they shall assign us; thus we shall know again that heavenly
world from which we have come, thus we shall not go astray.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:23">3:6:2:23</span></span>23. And
whichever of them are raised they are

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

thereby visibly in this world; but whichever of them are assigned they
are thereby visibly in yonder world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:24">3:6:2:24</span></span>24.
They have two names; for, in truth, they themselves insisted thereon,
saying, 'We have not prospered with these names, since Soma has been
taken away from us; well, then, let us take each a second name!' They
took each a second name, and therewith prospered, inasmuch as they from
whom the Soma-draught had been taken had a share in the sacrifice
assigned to them; hence they have two names. Wherefore let a Brahman, if
he prosper not, take a second name, for verily he prospers, whosoever,
knowing this, takes a second name.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:25">3:6:2:25</span></span>25. Now
what he offers in the fire, that he offers unto the gods, thereby the
gods exist; and what (Soma) is consumed in the Sadas, that he offers
unto men, thereby men exist; and in that the Nârâ*s*a*m*sa <span
id="fr_409"></span>[1](#fn_407) cups of Soma.md) stand with the Soma-carts,
thereby he offers unto the Fathers, thereby the Fathers exist.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:2:26">3:6:2:26</span></span>26. But
those creatures which are not admitted to the sacrifice are forlorn;
wherefore he now admits to the sacrifice those creatures here on earth
that are not forlorn; behind <span id="fr_410"></span>[2](#fn_408.md) the
men are the beasts; and behind the gods are the birds, the plants, and

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

the trees; and thus whatsoever exists here on earth all that is admitted
to the sacrifice. And verily both the gods and men, and the Fathers
drink together <span id="fr_411"></span>[1](#fn_409.md), and this is their
symposium; of old they drank together visibly, but now they do so
unseen.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_392"></span>[148:4](sbe2624.htm#fr_394.md) There are
altogether eight dhish*n*yas, two of which, viz. the Âgnîdhra and the
Mâr*g*âlîya, are raised north and south of the back part of the
cart-shed (havirdhâna) respectively; while the other six are raised
inside the Sadas along the east side of it, viz. five of them north of
the 'spine,' belonging (from south to north) to the Hot*ri*,
Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*si, Pot*ri*, Nesh*tri*, and A*kh*âvâka respectively;
and one south of the spine, exactly south-east of the Udumbara post, for
the Maitrâvaru*n*a (or Pra*s*âst*ri*) priest. These six priests,
together with the Âgnîdhra, are called the 'seven Hot*ri*s.' The
Âgnîdhra and Mâr*g*âlîya have square sheds with four posts erected over
them, open on the east side and on the side facing the cart-shed. The
Âgnîdhra hearth is thrown up first, and the Mâr*g*âlîya last of all; and
the Maitrâvaru*n*a's immediately after that of the Hot*ri*. For the
formulas by which they are consecrated, see Vâ*g*. S. V, 32, 32.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[149:1](sbe2624.htm#fr_395.md) That is, the parts
of the body corresponding to one another, as arms, loins, &c.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[149:2](sbe2624.htm#fr_396.md) See [III, 2, 4,
1](sbe2610.htm#3:2:4:1.md) seq.; Oldenberg, Zeitsch. d. Deutsch. Morg. Ges.
XXXVII, p. 67 seq.; Weber, Ind. Stud. VIII, p. 31.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[149:3](sbe2624.htm#fr_397.md) In Taitt. S. VI, 1,
6; Kâ*th*. XXIII, 10, supar*n*î, 'the well-winged,' is identified with
the sky.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[149:4](sbe2624.htm#fr_398.md) Lit. 'she shall win
both of us,' i.e. each saying that the other would win herself.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[150:1](sbe2624.htm#fr_399.md) 'And because these
two there disputed, therefore the story called "Saupar*n*akâdrava" is
here told,' Kâ*n*va text. It is difficult to see how this statement came
to be inserted here, unless it be because of a division in the
text,--this paragraph being the nineteen [hundredth](errata.htm#2.md) in
the Mâdhyandina recension. This explanation would not, however, apply to
the Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[150:2](sbe2624.htm#fr_400.md) 'Therewith redeem
thee from death,' Kâ*n*va rec.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[150:3](sbe2624.htm#fr_401.md) Ku*s*î? = ko*s*î,
'pod' (or case). Sâya*n*a explains it by 'âyudha' (? weapon, or vessel.
sheath).

<span id="fn_400"></span>[151:1](sbe2624.htm#fr_402.md) Sâya*n*a takes it
in the sense of 'she swallowed (khâd),' but I should feel inclined to
refer it to the same verb 'khid' (? khad) as 'âkhidat' coming
immediately after it. Could Pâ*n*ini's Sûtra VI, 1, 52 refer to this
passage? \[Kâ*s*. V., Benares edition *k*ikhâda; MS. Indian Office
*k*akhâda.\] The Kâ*n*va text has the same reading: â*k*akhâda-âkhidat.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[152:1](sbe2624.htm#fr_403.md) See [III, 3, 3,
11](sbe2613.htm#3:3:3:11.md).

<span id="fn_402"></span>[152:2](sbe2624.htm#fr_404.md) For these oblations
poured upon burning bundles of chips and grass held over the several
hearth-fires, see [IV, 4, 2, 7](sbe2656.htm#4:4:2:7.md).

<span id="fn_403"></span>[152:3](sbe2624.htm#fr_405.md) Yad vâ uparyupari
somam bibhrata*h* sa*mk*arishyanti, Kâ*n*va rec. (? holding the Soma
close above the dhish*n*yas). This passage <span id="page_153">p.
153</span> apparently refers to the *K*amasa-Adhvaryus or cup-bearers,
who at the time of the Savanas hold up their cups filled with Soma,
which, after libations have been made of it on the fire, is drunk by the
priests.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[153:1](sbe2624.htm#fr_406.md) Samayâ; the Kâ*n*va
text has 'pratyaṅ (in going to the back)' instead.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[153:2](sbe2624.htm#fr_407.md) That is, bestrewed
with gravel.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[153:3](sbe2624.htm#fr_408.md) When the
dhish*n*yas have been completed, the Adhvaryu, standing east of the
front door of the Sadas, has to point at the Âhavanîya, the
Bahishpavamâna-place, the pit whence the earth for the hearths and high
altar was taken, the slaughtering place, the Udumbara post, the
Brahman's seat, the (old Âhavanîya at the) hall-door, the old
Gârhapatya, and the Utkara (heap of rubbish) one by one with the texts,
Vâ*g*. S. V, 32, 2, &c. Kâty. VIII, 6, 23, 24.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[154:1](sbe2624.htm#fr_409.md) Nârâ*s*a*m*sa,
'pertaining to Narâ*s*a*m*sa (man's praise, i.e. Agni, or Soma, or the
Fathers),' is the name given to certain remains of Soma-libations (or
potations) sacred to the Fathers, which, in the nine Soma-cups, are
temporarily deposited under the axle of the southern Soma-cart, till
they are drunk by the priests at the end of the libation.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[154:2](sbe2624.htm#fr_410.md) Or, alongside of;
corresponding to, included in, them (anu).

<span id="fn_409"></span>[155:1](sbe2624.htm#fr_411.md) 'Sma' does not seem
here to nave its usual force, which it has in the next sentence,
combined with 'purâ.'
