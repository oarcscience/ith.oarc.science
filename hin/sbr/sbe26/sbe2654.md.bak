### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

##### D. THE T*RI*TÎYA SAVANA, OR EVENING PRESSING.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:1">4:3:5:1</span></span>1. Now
there are three kinds of gods,--the Vasus, the Rudras, and the Âdityas.
Between them the press-feasts are divided: the morning pressing belongs
to the Vasus, the midday pressing to the Rudras, and the third pressing
to the Âdityas. But the morning pressing belonged to the Vasus
exclusively, and the midday pressing to the Rudras exclusively, and the
third pressing to the Âdityas conjointly (with others).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:2">4:3:5:2</span></span>2. The
Âdityas then said, 'As that morning pressing belongs exclusively to the
Vasus, and that midday pressing exclusively to the Rudras, so offer ye
now to us a libation before the common (pressing).' The gods said, 'So
be it!' After the completion of the midday pressing, they offered that
(libation) previous to the third pressing <span
id="fr_820"></span>[1](#fn_817.md). And in like manner is that libation
offered to this day after the completion of the midday pressing and
previous to the third pressing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:3">4:3:5:3</span></span>3. The
Âdityas said, 'Neither in the one pressing have we a share nor in the
other: we fear lest the Rakshas might injure us!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:4">4:3:5:4</span></span>4. They
said to the (cups) belonging to two deities (dvidevatya <span
id="fr_821"></span>[2](#fn_818).md), 'We are afraid of the Rakshas: pray,
let us enter into you!'

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:5">4:3:5:5</span></span>5. The
Dvidevatyas said, 'What will be our reward then?'--'By us ye shall be
supplied with the Anuvasha*t* <span id="fr_822"></span>[1](#fn_819.md)!',
said the Âdityas.--'So be it!'--They entered into the dvidevatya cups.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:6">4:3:5:6</span></span>6. Hence,
when at the morning pressing he (the Adhvaryu) proceeds with the
dvidevatya cups, the Pratiprasthât*ri* draws Soma juice from the
Dro*n*akala*s*a into the Âditya vessel, with this much (of the formula,
Vâ*g*. S. VIII, I), 'Thou art taken with a support!' The Adhvaryu calls
for the (Agnîdh's) *S*rausha*t*, and after the Adhvaryu's libation the
Pratiprasthât*ri* pours (his juice into the fire), and with this much
'Thee to the Âdityas!' he pours the remains (into the Âditya-sthâlî). In
the same way at all (three dvidevatya libations).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:7">4:3:5:7</span></span>7. Thus,
the reason why the Pratiprasthât*ri* draws the Soma-juice, is that they
entered into the dvidevatya cups. And the Âdityas then said, 'By us ye
shall be supplied with the Anuvasha*t*!' For, that second libation which
he (the Pratiprasthât*ri*) makes, he makes to (Agni) Svish*t*ak*ri*t,
and by means of the Svish*t*ak*ri*t these (dvidevatyas) are supplied
with the Anuvasha*t*; and thus those (libations) of

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

his are supplied with the Anuvasha*t*, having the (oblation to Agni)
Svish*t*ak*ri*t performed for them. He offers on the north part (of the
fire), for that is the region of that god <span
id="fr_823"></span>[1](#fn_820.md): hence he offers on the north part.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:8">4:3:5:8</span></span>8. And
again, why the Pratiprasthât*ri* draws the Soma. They entered into the
Dvidevatyas; and from those which they entered he thereby draws them
out. He then covers it <span id="fr_824"></span>[2](#fn_821.md)--for they
were afraid of the Rakshas--with 'O Vish*n*u, Far-strider, here is thy
Soma, protect it lest they should injure it!' For Vish*n*u is the
sacrifice: to the sacrifice he thus makes it over for protection. Now,
after the completion of the midday Soma feast and before the evening
feast he says, 'Come hither, Sacrificer!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:9">4:3:5:9</span></span>9. They
enter (the Havirdhâna) together,--the Adhvaryu, Sacrificer, Âgnîdhra,
Pratiprasthât*ri*, Unnet*ri*, and whatever other attendant (of the
Adhvaryu) there is <span id="fr_825"></span>[3](#fn_822.md). They close
both doors,--for they (the Âdityas) were afraid of the Rakshas. He (the
Adhvaryu) takes up the Âditya-sthâlî and Âditya-pâtra, and holds them
close over the Pûtabh*ri*t, 'lest (any Soma juice) should be spilt.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:10">4:3:5:10</span></span>10. He
then draws (the juice from the sthâlî into the pâtra) with (Vâ*g*. S.
VIII, 2; Rig-veda VIII, 51, 7), 'At no time art thou barren, and never
failest thou the worshipper, O Indra; but

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

more and ever more is thy divine gift increased, O mighty lord!--Thee to
the Âdityas!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:11">4:3:5:11</span></span>11. Let
him not draw it with a 'support'--for it was originally drawn with a
support--to avoid a repetition (of sacrificial performance); but were he
now also to draw it with a support, he would certainly commit a
repetition.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:12">4:3:5:12</span></span>12.
Having withdrawn (the cup for a moment from the flowing juice), he again
pours it in with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 3; Rig-veda VIII, 52, 7), 'At no time
art thou heedless, but watchest over both generations; the Soma
feast <span id="fr_826"></span>[1](#fn_823.md) is thy strength, O fourth
Âditya: the ambrosia is ready for thee in the heavens!--Thee to the
Âdityas!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:13">4:3:5:13</span></span>13.
Thereupon he takes sour milk; for the evening pressing belongs to the
Âdityas, and cattle are after (the manner of) the Âdityas <span
id="fr_827"></span>[2](#fn_824.md): he thereby puts milk into the cattle,
and thus that milk in cattle is beneficial <span
id="fr_828"></span>[3](#fn_825.md). 'He should put it right in the centre
(of the Âditya cup),' they say, 'for that milk is right in the centre of
cattle.' But let him rather put it in the back part (of the cup), for
that milk is in the hind part of cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:14">4:3:5:14</span></span>14. And
the reason why he takes sour milk is that those remains (of Soma) poured
together are the leavings of offerings, and insufficient for an
oblation: he now increases those (remains), and thus they

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

become sufficient for an oblation. This is why he takes sour milk.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:15">4:3:5:15</span></span>15. He
takes it with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 4; Rig-veda I, 107, I), 'The sacrifice
draweth nigh to the glory of the gods: be ye merciful, O Âdityas! Let
your favour incline unto us, that it may set us free from all
trouble!--Thee to the Âdityas!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:16">4:3:5:16</span></span>16. He
mixes it by means of the Upâ*ms*usavana stone <span
id="fr_829"></span>[1](#fn_826.md). For, indeed, that Âditya Vivasvat (the
sun) is really the same as the Upâ*ms*usavana, and this is the Âditya
libation: thus he makes him delight in his own share.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:17">4:3:5:17</span></span>17. He
touches it neither with the fringe nor with (the woven part of) the
straining-cloth; for those two pressings, the morning pressing and
midday pressing, forsooth are rich in pure Soma, rich in juice, but
this, the third pressing, is emptied of its pure Soma. Now, in that he
does not touch it either with the fringe or the straining-cloth, thereby
that third pressing of his also becomes rich in pure Soma and juice:
therefore he touches it neither with the fringe nor with the
straining-cloth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:18">4:3:5:18</span></span>18. He
mixes it with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 5), 'O Âditya Vivasvat, this is thy
draught of Soma: feast thou upon it!' Thereupon he hands the
Upâ*ms*usavana to the Unnet*ri*. Then he says to the Unnet*ri*, 'Drop in
the pressing-stones!' He drops them either into the Âdhavanîya or into a
cup <span id="fr_830"></span>[2](#fn_827.md).

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:19">4:3:5:19</span></span>19.
After drawing the king (Soma)--the third press-feast belonging to the
Âdityas, and the pressing-stones being after (the manner of <span
id="fr_831"></span>[1](#fn_828).md) the Âdityas, he thus makes them delight
in their own share--they open the doors.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:20">4:3:5:20</span></span>20. He
now walks out, covering (the cup with his hand or the sthâlî); for they
(the Âdityas) were afraid of the Rakshas. He then says (to the
Maitrâvaru*n*a), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the Âdityas!' If he
likes, he may now enumerate (their qualities); but let him rather
enumerate them, after he has called for the *S*rausha*t*,--'Prompt (the
Hot*ri* to recite the offering prayer) to the Âdityas, the beloved,
rite-loving, law-loving lords of the great abode, the rulers of the wide
air.' He offers, as the Vasha*t* is pronounced. He (the Hot*ri*)
pronounces no Anuvasha*t*, lest he should consign the cattle to the
fire. The remains (of juice in the sthâlî and graha) he (the Adhvaryu)
hands to the Pratiprasthât*ri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:21">4:3:5:21</span></span>21.
Thereupon he again enters (the Havirdhâna) and draws the Âgraya*n*a
graha <span id="fr_832"></span>[2](#fn_829.md). They spread (over the
Pûtabh*ri*t) a straining-cloth with the fringe towards the north. The
Adhvaryu pours out (the

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

juice) of the Âgraya*n*a; the Pratiprasthât*ri* holds out (and pours in)
the two residues (of the Âditya graha <span
id="fr_833"></span>[1](#fn_830).md); the Unnet*ri* adds thereto (some juice
from the Âdhavanîya) by means of a *k*amasa cup or a dipping-vessel
(uda*ñk*ana).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:22">4:3:5:22</span></span>22.
Thus he draws the Âgraya*n*a graha from four streams; for the evening
pressing belongs to the .Âdityas, and cows are after the manner of the
Âdityas; whence this milk of cows is of a fourfold nature: therefore he
draws the Âgraya*n*a from four streams <span
id="fr_834"></span>[2](#fn_831.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:23">4:3:5:23</span></span>23. And
as to why the Pratiprasthât*ri* holds out the two residues: this is (the
remains of) the Âditya libation, and for the Âditya libation he
pronounces no Anuvasha*t*; and from that (Âgraya*n*a graha) he intends
to draw the Sâvitra graha,--so that the Anuvasha*t* is performed for it
by means of the Sâvitra graha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:5:24">4:3:5:24</span></span>24. And
again why the Pratiprasthât*ri* holds out the two residues. Previous to
that mixed (press-feast), previous to the evening feast, they have
offered that (unmixed or special) libation to those (Âdityas); but this
libation is taken for the evening feast: thereby the Âdityas take part
in the evening feast, and thus they are not excluded from the sacrifice.
This is why the Pratiprasthât*ri* holds out the two residues <span
id="fr_835"></span>[3](#fn_832.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_817"></span>[350:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_820.md) The Âditya-graha,
with which the succeeding paragraphs deal, is considered as not
belonging to the T*ri*tîya Savana proper, but as a preliminary ceremony.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[350:2](sbe2654.htm#fr_821.md) For the three
dvidevatya grahas (Aindravâyava, Maitrâvaru*n*a, and Â*s*vina), see
Brâhma*n*as [IV, 1, 3](sbe2642.htm#4:1:3)-[5](sbe2644.htm#4:1:5.md).

<span id="fn_819"></span>[351:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_822.md) At the three
dvidevatya libations no Anuvasha*t*kâra is permitted; that is to say,
the Hot*ri* is not to pronounce the words, 'O Agni, accept of the Soma!'
after the Vasha*t*, with which the offering prayer (yâ*g*yâ) concludes.
But as the libation, ordinarily made at the Anuvasha*t*, corresponds to
the oblation to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t made after each chief oblation at
the havirya*gñ*a (see I, 7,3; Ait. Br. III, 5), there is apparently no
such Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation at the dvidevatya libations. Now, as each
of these chief libations, made by the Adhvaryu, is followed by one made
by the Pratiprasthât*ri* from the Âditya vessel (see [p.
316](sbe2649.htm#page_316), note [1](sbe2650.htm#fn_763).md), these latter
libations are here, as it were, identified with the Svish*t*ak*ri*t and
the Anuvasha*t*kâra.

<span id="fn_820"></span>[352:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_823.md) See I, 7, 3, 20.

<span id="fn_821"></span>[352:2](sbe2654.htm#fr_824.md) The remains of
Soma-juice he pours after each libation from the Âditya-pâtra into the
Âditya-sthâlî, and finally puts the former on the latter by way of a
lid. See [p. 326](sbe2651.htm#page_326), note [1](sbe2651.htm#fn_775.md).

<span id="fn_822"></span>[352:3](sbe2654.htm#fr_825.md) While they enter by
the front door, the mistress of the house enters by the back (west)
door. Kâty. X, 4, 2.

<span id="fn_823"></span>[353:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_826.md) The Rig-veda reads
'havanam' (invocation) instead of 'savanam.'

<span id="fn_824"></span>[353:2](sbe2654.htm#fr_827.md) Or, cattle
correspond, stand in relation, to the Âdityas. Sâya*n*a takes 'anu' in
the sense of 'behind, inferior to, dependent upon (hîna).' The cattle
are inferior to, or dependent upon, the Âdityas, inasmuch as the Âdityas
give the rain on which the cattle depend for their food.

<span id="fn_825"></span>[353:3](sbe2654.htm#fr_828) Or, 'put' (hita.md)
into them.

<span id="fn_826"></span>[354:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_829.md) See [p.
238](sbe2638.htm#page_238), note [2](sbe2639.htm#fn_587.md).

<span id="fn_827"></span>[354:2](sbe2654.htm#fr_830.md) 'Into the
Âdhavanîya trough or into a *k*amasa cup containing Soma-juice,' Kâty.
X, 4, 10; 'into the Âdhavanîya or the Sambhara*n*î,' Kâ*n*va text; 'into
the Âdhavanîya or into the graha,' Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 386. Perhaps the
next paragraph has to <span id="page_355">p. 355</span> be taken along
with this: 'Or into a *k*amasa, after drawing Soma (into it).' According
to Kâty., the stones are taken out again immediately and laid down in
their places on the pressing-skin.

<span id="fn_828"></span>[355:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_831.md) See [p.
353](#page_353), note [2](#fn_824.md). Sâya*n*a again takes 'anu' in the
sense of 'after, behind,' apparently on the ground that, in the above
formulas, the stones are mentioned after the Âditya. The text of my
manuscript is, however, rather corrupt at this place.

<span id="fn_829"></span>[355:2](sbe2654.htm#fr_832.md) The Âgraya*n*a Soma
was originally drawn into the Âgraya*n*a bowl (sthâlî) and deposited in
its place in the centre of the khara. It is now poured from the bowl
into some other vessel, and thence through a straining-cloth into the
Pûtabh*ri*t.

<span id="fn_830"></span>[356:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_833.md) 'Sampraskandayati
pratiprasthâtâdityapâtrayo*h* sa*m*sravam,' Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_831"></span>[356:2](sbe2654.htm#fr_834.md) In drawing the
Âgraya*n*a cup he uses the same formula as at the morning pressing. See
[IV, 2, 2, 9](sbe2646.htm#4:2:2:9.md) seq.

<span id="fn_832"></span>[356:3](sbe2654.htm#fr_835.md) In the actual
performance of the Agnish*t*oma the drawing of the Âgraya*n*a graha is
followed by sour milk being poured to the Soma-juice left in the
Pûtabh*ri*t, the compound being consecrated by the lady eying it with an
appropriate mantra. Thereupon they leave the Havirdhâna shed in the same
way as at the morning feast <span id="page_357">p. 357</span> (see [IV,
2, 5, 1](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:1), with notes.md), and perform the
Viprud-homas, followed by the Sarpa*n*a and chanting of the Ârbhava, or
T*ri*tîya Pavamâna stotra (for an account of which, see [p.
315](sbe2649.htm#page_315), note [2](sbe2649.htm#fn_759).md). Then follow
the oblations from the victim (which has been cooking since the morning,
see [IV, 2, 5, 13](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:13).md), &c., up to the eating of the
pa*s*vi*d*â (see [III, 8, 3, 4](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:4) seq..md); and offering
of the four Savanîya-puro*d*â*s*as, likewise up to the eating of the
i*d*â. Previous to the eating, small pieces of rice-cake are thrown into
the *k*amasa cups, as an oblation to the sacrificer's deceased
ancestors, with naming of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather
(as at the Pi*nd*apit*ri*ya*gñ*a, II, 4, 2, 19 seq.); whereupon the
pieces are eaten along with the i*d*â.
