### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:5:1">4:5:5:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati, forsooth, is that sacrifice which is performed here, and
from which these creatures have been produced: and in like manner are
they produced thereafter even to this day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:5:2">4:5:5:2</span></span>2. After
the Upâ*ms*u cup goats are produced. Now that (cup) is again employed in
the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:5:3">4:5:5:3</span></span>3. After
the Antâryama cup sheep are produced. Now that (cup) is again employed
at the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again.

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:5:4">4:5:5:4</span></span>4. And
because of those two (cups) which are together he offers the Upâ*ms*u
first, therefore, of goats and sheep when they are together <span
id="fr_950"></span>[1](#fn_944.md), the goats go first, and the sheep
behind them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:5:5">4:5:5:5</span></span>5. And
because, having offered the Upâ*ms*u, he wipes (the vessel) upwards,
therefore these goats walk like nimbly <span
id="fr_951"></span>[2](#fn_945.md) climbing spokes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:5:6">4:5:5:6</span></span>6. And
because, having offered the Antaryâma, he wipes (the vessel) downwards,
therefore these sheep walk with their heads down, as if digging. Now
they, the goats and sheep, are most conspicuously Pra*g*âpati-like:
whence, bringing forth thrice in the year, they produce two or
three <span id="fr_952"></span>[3](#fn_946) (young ones.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:5:7">4:5:5:7</span></span>7.
After <span id="fr_953"></span>[4](#fn_947.md) the *S*ukra cup men are
produced. Now that (cup) is again employed at the sacrifice: hence
creatures are here produced again and again. But the *S*ukra (bright) is
the same as he that burns yonder, and he indeed is Indra; and of
animals, man is Indra-like <span id="fr_954"></span>[5](#fn_948.md): whence
he rules over animals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:5:8">4:5:5:8</span></span>8. After
the *Ri*tu cup the one-hoofed species is produced. Now that (cup) is
again employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again
and again. And such-like is the Ritu cup <span
id="fr_955"></span>[6](#fn_949.md), and suchlike the head of the
one-hoofed. The Âgraya*n*a

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

cup, the Ukthya cup, and the Âditya cup,--after them cows are produced.
Now, these are again employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here
produced again and again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:5:9">4:5:5:9</span></span>9. And
because goats are produced after the fewest cups, therefore, though
bringing forth thrice in a year, producing two or three, (they are) very
few, for they are produced after the fewest cups.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:5:10">4:5:5:10</span></span>10. And
because cows are produced after the most cups, therefore, though
bringing forth once in a year, and producing one each time, (they are)
most numerous, for they are produced after the most cups.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:5:11">4:5:5:11</span></span>11.
Then, in the Dro*n*akala*s*a (trough) he finally draws the Hâriyo*g*ana
graha. Now, the Dro*n*akala*s*a is Pra*g*âpati;--he turns unto these
creatures, and fosters them, and kisses them <span
id="fr_956"></span>[1](#fn_950.md): he fosters them in that he produces
them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:5:12">4:5:5:12</span></span>12.
Now, these same cups after which creatures are produced, are
five,--those of the Upâ*ms*u and Antaryâma (counting as) one and the
same, the *S*ukra cup, the *Ri*tu cup, the Âgraya*n*a cup, and the
Ukthya cup; for there are five seasons in the year, and Pra*g*âpati is
the year, and the sacrifice is Pra*g*âpati. But if there be six seasons
in the year, then the Âditya cup is the sixth of them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:5:13">4:5:5:13</span></span>13. But
indeed there is only that one cup after which creatures are produced
here, to wit, the Upâ*ms*u cup; for the Upâ*ms*u is breath, and
Pra*g*âpati is breath, and everything here is after Pra*g*âpati.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_944"></span>[407:1](sbe2664.htm#fr_950.md) That is, in mixed
flocks. In the compound 'a*g*âvika' (Kâ*n*v. a*g*âvaya*h*, αἶγες καὶ
ὄϊες) also the goats come first.

<span id="fn_945"></span>[407:2](sbe2664.htm#fr_951.md) Perhaps 'ara' has
to be taken in the sense of 'quick, nimble,' instead of 'spokes,' and
'*d*îtara' might mean 'flying up,' 'popping up their heads,' as opposed
to 'avâ*k*îna*s*îrshan.'

<span id="fn_946"></span>[407:3](sbe2664.htm#fr_952) ? Or, three (times.md)
two, 'dvau trîn iti;' the Kâ*n*va text reads (of goats alone) 'trî*m*s
trîn.'

<span id="fn_947"></span>[407:4](sbe2664.htm#fr_953.md) Or, along with,
correspondingly with, anu.

<span id="fn_948"></span>[407:5](sbe2664.htm#fr_954.md) Or, connected with
Indra, Indra's own (aindra).

<span id="fn_949"></span>[407:6](sbe2664.htm#fr_955.md) The two
*Ri*tupâtras are shaped like spoon-bowls, with spouts on both sides.

<span id="fn_950"></span>[408:1](sbe2664.htm#fr_956.md) Or, smells, sniffs
at them (as a cow does the calf).
