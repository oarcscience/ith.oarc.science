Verily, they who sit (sacrificing) for a year, by means of six months go
to him that burns yonder:

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

so it is told on the part of the Sâman, in as much as it is made of the
form of that (sun) it is told on the part of the *Ri*k <span
id="fr_995"></span>[1](#fn_989.md); and now in like manner on the part of
the Ya*g*us, by means of preparatory rite, when they draw that
(graha) <span id="fr_996"></span>[2](#fn_990.md), they thereby also go to
him (the sun).

<span id="page_428">p. 428</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:2:2">4:6:2:2</span></span>2. He
thus takes it therefrom with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 41; Rig-veda I, 50,
1) <span id="fr_997"></span>[1](#fn_991.md), 'The lights bear on high that
divine knower of beings, Sûrya, that all may see him!--Thou art drawn
with a support: thee to Sûrya nor splendour!--This is thy womb: thee to
Sûrya for splendour!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_988"></span>[426:3](sbe2671.htm#fr_994.md) The great
sacrificial session (sattra), called Gavâm ayana, or <span
id="page_427">p. 427</span> cows' walk (or course), usually extends over
twelve months (of 30 days), and consists of the following parts:

Prâya*n*îya Atirâtra, or opening day.

*K*aturvi*ms*a day, an Ukthya, all the stotras of which are in the
*K*aturvi*ms*a stoma.

Five months, each consisting of four Abhiplava sha*d*ahas and one
P*ri*sh*th*ya sha*d*aha (= 30 days). Cf. [p. 402](sbe2662.htm#page_402.md),
n. [2](sbe2663.htm#fn_935.md).

28 days, which, with the two opening days, complete the sixth month:

Three Abhiplavas and one P*ri*sh*th*ya.  
Abhi*g*it day.  
Three Svarasâman days.

VISHUVANT or central day.

28 days, which, with the two concluding days, complete the seventh
month:

Three Svarasâman days.  
Vi*s*va*g*it day.  
One P*ri*sh*th*ya and three Abhiplavas.

Four months, each consisting of four Abhiplavas and one P*ri*sh*th*ya.

30 days:

(Three Abhiplava sha*d*ahas.  
One Gosh*t*oma (Agnish*t*oma, [p. 403](sbe2663.htm#page_403.md), n.
[4](sbe2663.htm#fn_937).md).  
One Âyush*t*oma (Ukthya).  
One Da*s*arâtra (the ten central days of the Dvâda*s*âha, [p.

In imitation of the retrograde course of the sun, the order of the
performance during the second part of the year is, generally speaking,
the reverse of that of the former half.
