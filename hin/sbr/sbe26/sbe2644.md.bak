### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:1">4:1:5:1</span></span>1. The
Â*s*vina graha <span id="fr_655"></span>[3](#fn_653.md), forsooth, is his
organ of hearing; hence in drinking it he turns (the cup) all
round <span id="fr_656"></span>[4](#fn_654.md), since with that ear of his
he hears all round.--Now when the Bh*ri*gus, or the Aṅgiras, attained
the heavenly world, *K*yavana the Bhârgava, or *K*yavana the Âṅgirasa,
was left behind here (on earth) decrepit and ghostlike <span
id="fr_657"></span>[5](#fn_655.md).

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:2">4:1:5:2</span></span>2. But
*S*aryâta, the Mânava, just then wandered about here with his tribe, and
settled near by that same place. His boys <span
id="fr_658"></span>[1](#fn_656.md), while playing, setting that decrepit,
ghostlike man at nought, pelted him with clods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:3">4:1:5:3</span></span>3. He was
wroth with the *S*âryâtas, and sowed discord among them: father fought
with son, and brother with brother.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:4">4:1:5:4</span></span>4.
*S*aryâta then bethought him <span
id="fr_659"></span>[2](#fn_657.md),--'This has come to pass for something
or other I have done!' He caused the cowherds and shepherds to be called
together, and said--

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:5">4:1:5:5</span></span>5. He
said, 'Which of you has seen anything here this day?'--They said,
'Yonder lies a man, decrepit and ghostlike: him the boys have pelted
with clods, setting him at nought.' Then *S*aryâta knew that this was
*K*yavana.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:6">4:1:5:6</span></span>6. He
yoked his chariot, and putting his daughter Sukanyâ thereon, he set
forth, and came to the place where the *Ri*shi was.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:7">4:1:5:7</span></span>7. He
said, 'Reverence be to thee, O *Ri*shi;

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

because I knew thee not, therefore have I offended thee; here is
Sukanyâ <span id="fr_660"></span>[1](#fn_658.md), with her I make atonement
to thee: let my tribe live at peace together!' And from that same time
his tribe lived at peace together. But *S*aryâta, the Mânava,
departed <span id="fr_661"></span>[2](#fn_659.md) forthwith, lest he should
offend him a second time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:8">4:1:5:8</span></span>8. Now
the A*s*vins then wandered about here on earth performing cures. They
came to Sukanyâ, and desired to win her love; but she consented not
thereto.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:9">4:1:5:9</span></span>9. They
said, 'Sukanyâ, what a decrepit, ghostlike man is that whom thou liest
with; come and follow us!' She said, 'To whom my father has given me,
him will I not abandon, as long as he lives!' But the *Ri*shi was aware
of this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:10">4:1:5:10</span></span>10. He
said, 'Sukanyâ, what have those two said to thee?' She told him all;
and, when she had told him, he said, 'If they speak to thee thus again,
say thou to them, "But surely, ye are neither quite complete nor quite
perfect, and yet ye deride my husband!" and if they say to thee, "In
what respect are we incomplete, in what respect imperfect?" say thou to
them, "Nay, make ye my husband young again, and I will tell you!"' They
came again to her, and said to her the same thing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:11">4:1:5:11</span></span>11. She
said, 'But surely ye are neither quite complete nor quite perfect, and
yet ye deride my husband!' They said, 'In what respect are we
incomplete, in what respect imperfect?' She said, 'Nay, make ye my
husband young again, and I will tell you!'

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:12">4:1:5:12</span></span>12.
They said, 'Take him down to yonder pool <span
id="fr_662"></span>[1](#fn_660.md), and he shall come forth with whatever
age he shall desire!' She took him down to that pool, and he came forth
with the age he desired.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:13">4:1:5:13</span></span>13.
They said, Sukanyâ, in what respect are we incomplete, in what respect
imperfect?' The *Ri*shi himself answered them,--'In Kurukshetra yonder
the gods perform a sacrifice and exclude you two from it: in that
respect ye are incomplete, in that respect imperfect!' And the A*s*vins
departed forthwith, and came to the gods, as they were performing a
sacrifice, after the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:14">4:1:5:14</span></span>14.
They said, 'Invite us thereto!' The gods said, 'We will not invite you:
ye have wandered and mixed much among men, performing cures.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:15">4:1:5:15</span></span>15.
They said, 'But surely ye worship with a

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

headless sacrifice!'--'How with a headless (sacrifice)?'--'Nay, invite
us, and we will tell you!'--'So be it!' so they invited them. They drew
this Â*s*vina cup for them; and those two became the Adhvaryu priests of
the sacrifice, and restored the head of the sacrifice. Then, in the
chapter of the divâkîrtyas <span id="fr_663"></span>[1](#fn_661.md), it is
explained how they did restore the head of the sacrifice. Hence this
libation is drawn after the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna, for it was
after the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna that they arrived.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:16">4:1:5:16</span></span>16.
They said, 'Well, but we two, being the Adhvaryus, are the heads
(leaders) of the sacrifice: transfer ye that graha of ours to this
earlier time, to those belonging to two deities <span
id="fr_664"></span>[2](#fn_662.md)!' Accordingly they transferred that
graha for them to a former time, to those belonging to two deities:
hence that graha is drawn in the tenth place, and is consecrated by
Vasha*t* in the third place. And as to (the significance of) the
A*s*vins,--the A*s*vins are manifestly <span
id="fr_665"></span>[3](#fn_663.md) those two, heaven and earth <span
id="fr_666"></span>[4](#fn_664.md), for it is those two

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

that have obtained possession of everything here;--'the lotus-crowned'
they (the A*s*vins) are called: Agni, forsooth, is the lotus of this
earth, and the sun that of yonder sky.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:17">4:1:5:17</span></span>17.
Thus he takes (the Â*s*vina graha) from that (stream of Soma) <span
id="fr_667"></span>[1](#fn_665.md), with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 11; Rig-veda I,
22, 3), 'Mix ye the sacrifice, O A*s*vins, with that goad of yours, rich
in honey and joyfulness!--Thou art taken with a support <span
id="fr_668"></span>[2](#fn_666.md)! thee for the A*s*vins!' with 'This is
thy womb: thee for the honey-loving <span
id="fr_669"></span>[3](#fn_667) (A*s*vins.md)!' he deposits it. Now as to
why he takes (the graha) with a verse containing (the word) 'honey
(madhu),' and deposits it with 'thee for the honey-loving!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:18">4:1:5:18</span></span>18.
Dadhya*ñk*, the Âtharva*n*a, imparted to them (the A*s*vins) the
brâhma*n*a called Madhu <span id="fr_670"></span>[4](#fn_668.md): that
(Madhu) is their favourite resort, and with that (favourite resort) of
theirs he now approaches them;--hence he takes (their graha) with a
verse containing (the word) 'honey,' and deposits it with 'thee for the
honey-loving!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:5:19">4:1:5:19</span></span>19. Now
those vessels (other than those of the three dvidevatya grahas) are
smooth <span id="fr_671"></span>[5](#fn_669.md). The vessel of the graha
for Indra and Vâyu has a (wooden)

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'belt' round it:
this is its second (peculiarity of) shape, and therefore it belongs to
two deities. The vessel of the graha for Mitra and Varu*n*a is
goat-like <span id="fr_672"></span>[1](#fn_670.md): this is its second
shape, and therefore it belongs to two deities. The vessel of the graha
for the A*s*vins is lip-shaped: this is its second shape, and therefore
it belongs to two deities. And the reason why (this belongs to) the
A*s*vins is that the A*s*vins are the heads (mukhya, viz. of the
sacrifice), and this head (mukha <span id="fr_673"></span>[2](#fn_671).md)
is supplied with lips: hence the vessel of the A*s*vina graha is
lip-shaped.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_653"></span>[272:3](sbe2644.htm#fr_655.md) The A*s*vina graha
is not actually taken at this time, but later on, after the oblation of
drops and the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna stotra; see [IV, 2, 5,
12](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:12.md). The reasons for inserting it here are given
in parag. [15](sbe2644.htm#4:1:5:15)-[16](sbe2644.htm#4:1:5:16.md).

<span id="fn_654"></span>[272:4](sbe2644.htm#fr_656.md) Lit. 'he drinks it
while turning it all round,' in accordance with the regular Sanskrit
idiom. The Â*s*vina cup has three mouths, from which the Soma is drunk
by turns. See Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 132.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[272:5](sbe2644.htm#fr_657.md) On this legend, and
its probable connection with that of Medea's cauldron, and the Germanic
'quecprunno' (Jungbrunnen, well of renovation), see A. Kuhn, 'Herabkunft
des Feuers and des Göttertranks,' p. 11. For other translations, see
Weber, Ind. Streifen, i. p. 13 seq.; Muir, O. S. T. v. p. 250 seq.;
Delbrück ii. p. 121. For <span id="page_273">p. 273</span> another
version, apparently more modern, of the same legend, found in the
*G*aiminîya (Talavakâra) Brâhma*n*a, see Professor Whitney, Proceedings
Amer. Or. Soc. 1883, p. ix.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[273:1](sbe2644.htm#fr_658.md) That is, youths of
his clan.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[273:2](sbe2644.htm#fr_659.md) *S*aryâta then
bethought him, 'From something I have done, thence (has come) so great a
calamity.' It then occurred to him, 'Surely, *K*yavana, the Bhârgava, or
Âṅgirasa, was left behind here, decrepit: him I (must) have somehow
offended sorely, thence so great a calamity.' He called his tribe
together. Having called the tribe together, he said, 'Who, be he cowherd
or shepherd, has noticed anything here?' They said, 'Yonder in the wood
lies a decrepit, ghostlike man; him the boys have this day pelted with
clods: that is the only thing we have descried (? tad evâdarishma),' &c.
Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[274:1](sbe2644.htm#fr_660.md) That is, 'the fair
maiden.'

<span id="fn_659"></span>[274:2](sbe2644.htm#fr_661.md) That is, 'he broke
up his camp and departed with his tribe' (so ’payuyu*g*e grâma*h*,
Kâ*n*va recension).

<span id="fn_660"></span>[275:1](sbe2644.htm#fr_662.md) Or, according to
the Petersburg Dictionary, 'Throw him into yonder pool.' In the Kâ*n*va
text no mention is made of a pool (hrada), but merely of water to which
the *Ri*shi is taken by his wife. I subjoin Professor Whitney's
translation of the corresponding passage of the *G*aiminîya Br. version:
They (the A*s*vins) said to him: "Sage, make us sharers in the Soma,
Sir." "Very well," said he; "do you now make me young again." They drew
him away to the *s*ai*s*ava of the Sarasvatī. He said: "Girl, we shall
all come out looking alike; do you then know me by this sign." They all
came out looking just alike, with that form which is the most beautiful
of forms. She, recognising him . . . . "This is my husband." They said
to him: "Sage, we have performed for you that desire which has been your
desire; you have become young again; now instruct us in such wise that
we may be sharers in the Soma,". . . .

Then *K*yavana the Bhārgavan, having become young again, went to
*K*aryāta the Mānavan, and conducted his sacrifice on the eastern site.
Then he gave him a thousand; with them he sacrificed. Thus *K*yavana the
Bhārgavan, having praised with this sāman (the *k*yāvana), became young
again, won a girl for wife, sacrificed with a thousand,' &c.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[276:1](sbe2644.htm#fr_663.md) Certain verses
which are 'to be chanted by day.' According to Benfey (Ind. Stud. III,
p. 228) also called mahâdivâkîrtya, and consisting of eleven verses (not
in Sâma-veda), the first of which is called '*s*iras (head),' the second
'grîvâ*h* (neck),' &c. The term is also applied to Sâma-veda II, 803-5
(Rig-veda X, 170,1-3) in the Uhyagâna II, 12. The reference in the text
seems to be to *S*at. Br. XIV, 1, 1, 8 seq. See, however, Weber, Ind.
Streifen, I, p. 15, note 4. The Kâ*n*va MSS. read 'divâkîrteshu.'

<span id="fn_662"></span>[276:2](sbe2644.htm#fr_664.md) One might expect
the dual 'dvidevatyau,' as, besides the Â*s*vina graha, there are only
two dvidevatya (belonging to two gods) grahas, viz. the Aindra-vâyava
and Maitrâ-varu*n*a. See [p. 266](sbe2642.htm#page_266.md), note
[3](sbe2642.htm#fn_639.md).

<span id="fn_663"></span>[276:3](sbe2644.htm#fr_665.md) Or, in their
visible form (pratyaksham).

<span id="fn_664"></span>[276:4](sbe2644.htm#fr_666.md) See Muir, O. S. T.
v, p. 234. The identification of the A*s*vins with heaven and earth may
have been suggested by Rig-veda VI, 70, 5, <span id="page_277">p.
277</span> where heaven and earth are called upon to mix the sweet
drink, just as is the case with the A*s*vins in the verse with which
their libation is taken.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[277:1](sbe2644.htm#fr_667.md) See [p.
256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note [1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619.md).

<span id="fn_666"></span>[277:2](sbe2644.htm#fr_668.md) See [IV, 1, 2,
6](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:6.md), and note.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[277:3](sbe2644.htm#fr_669.md) The real meaning of
this epithet (mâdhvî) is uncertain.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[277:4](sbe2644.htm#fr_670.md) ? 'The mystery
called Madhu (sweet drink, Soma).' See part i, Introd. p. xxxiv; Weber,
Ind. Stud. I, p. 2

<span id="fn_669"></span>[277:5](sbe2644.htm#fr_671.md) It might also mean,
that those (three dvidevatya) vessels are smooth, straight, save the
peculiarities noticed above. The Kâ*n*va text, however, reads,
ta*kkh*lakshnâ*n*y anyâni pâtrâ*n*i bhavanti.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[278:1](sbe2644.htm#fr_672.md) Or rather,
according to the commentary on Kâty. IX, 2, 6, it resembles the breast
of the goat (a*g*akâ).

<span id="fn_671"></span>[278:2](sbe2644.htm#fr_673.md) Lit. 'mouth.'
