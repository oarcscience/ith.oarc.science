### SIXTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:1">3:6:1:1</span></span>1. The
Sadas <span id="fr_380"></span>[3](#fn_378.md) is no other than his
(Vish*n*u, the sacrifice's) belly; therefore they feed (drink) in the

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sadas; for
whatever food is eaten here on earth, all that settles down in the
belly. And because all the gods sat (sad) in it, therefore it is called
sadas: and so do these Brâhmans of every family now sit therein. By way
of deity it belongs to Indra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:2">3:6:1:2</span></span>2. In the
middle of it he puts up a (post) of udumbara wood (Ficus Glomerata); for
the udumbara means strength and food; now the Sadas being his
(Vish*n*u's belly), he thereby puts food therein; this is why he puts up
an udumbara (post) in the middle of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:3">3:6:1:3</span></span>3. From
the peg <span id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_379.md) which stands in the middle
on the hind-part of the altar, he strides six steps eastwards (along the
'spine'); the seventh he strides away from it to the right, for the sake
of completeness, and there marks off a pit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:4">3:6:1:4</span></span>4. He
takes the spade with (Vâ*g*. S. V, 26), 'At the impulse of the divine
Savit*ri*, I take thee with the arms of the A*s*vins, with the hands of
Pûshan: thou art a woman;' the significance of this formula is the same
(as before). That spade, indeed, is a female (feminine): therefore. he
says 'thou art a woman.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:5">3:6:1:5</span></span>5. He
then marks off the pit with, 'Herewith

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I cut off the
necks of the Rakshas!' for the spade is the thunderbolt: it is with the
thunderbolt that he cuts off the necks of the evil spirits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:6">3:6:1:6</span></span>6.
Thereupon he digs: eastwards he throws up the heap of earth. Having made
the udumbara (post) of the same size as the sacrificer <span
id="fr_382"></span>[1](#fn_380.md), he cuts it smooth all round, and lays
it down, with the top to the east, in front (of the pit). Thereon he
lays barhis-grass of the same length.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:7">3:6:1:7</span></span>7. Now
the sprinkling-water (used on this occasion) contains barley-corns. For
the essence (sap) of plants is water; wherefore plants when eaten alone
do not satiate; and the essence of water, on the other hand, are the
plants; wherefore water when drunk alone does not satiate; but only when
the two are united they satiate; for then they are sapful: 'with the
sapful I will sprinkle,' so he thinks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:8">3:6:1:8</span></span>8. Now,
the gods and the [Asuras](errata.htm#1.md), both of them sprung from
Pra*g*âpati, were contending. Then all the plants went away from the
gods, but the barley plants alone went not from them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:9">3:6:1:9</span></span>9. The
gods then prevailed: by means of these (barley-grains) they attracted to
themselves all the plants of their enemies; and because they attracted
(yu) therewith, therefore they are called yava (barley).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:10">3:6:1:10</span></span>10.
They said, 'Come, let us put into the barley whatever sap there is of
all plants!' And, accordingly, whatever sap there was of all plants,
that they put into the barley: therefore the latter thrives lustily
where other plants wither, for in such wise

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

did they put the sap into them. And in like manner does this one now by
means of those (barley-grains) attract to himself all the plants of his
enemies: this is why the sprinkling-water contains barley-corns.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:11">3:6:1:11</span></span>11. He
throws the barley-corns into it, with, 'Thou art barley (yava): keep
thou (yavaya) from us the haters, keep from us the enemies!' In this
there is nothing obscure. He then besprinkles (the post);--the
significance of the sprinkling is one and the same: he thereby renders
it sacrificially pure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:12">3:6:1:12</span></span>12. He
sprinkles (the top, middle, and bottom parts), with, 'For the sky--thee!
for the air--thee! for the earth--thee!' He thereby endows these worlds
with strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:13">3:6:1:13</span></span>13. And
the sprinkling-water which remains he pours into the hole, with, 'Be the
worlds pure wherein the Fathers reside!' for a pit that is dug is sacred
to the Fathers: this he thereby renders sacrificially pure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:14">3:6:1:14</span></span>14. He
now strews barhis-grass therein, both eastward-pointed and
northward-pointed with, 'Thou art the seat of the Fathers;' for that
part of it (the post) which is dug into the ground is sacred to the
Fathers; as though it were (naturally) established <span
id="fr_383"></span>[1](#fn_381.md) among plants, and not dug in, so does it
become established among those plants.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:15">3:6:1:15</span></span>15. He
raises it, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. V, 27), 'Prop thou the sky! fill the
air! stand firm on the earth!' Thereby he endows these worlds with
strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on these worlds.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:16">3:6:1:16</span></span>16. He
then sinks it (in the hole, with), 'May Dyutâna, the son of the Maruts,
plant thee!--' Dyutâna the son of the Maruts, doubtless, is he that
blows yonder (the wind): by means of him he thus plants it;--'Mitra and
Varu*n*a with firm support!' Mitra and Varu*n*a are the in-breathing and
out-breathing: he thus plants it with the in-breathing and
out-breathing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:17">3:6:1:17</span></span>17. He
then heaps up (earth) round it, with, 'I enclose thee, winner of the
priesthood, winner of the nobility, winner of growth of wealth!'
Manifold, verily, is the prayer for blessing in the sacrificial texts:
by this one he prays for the priesthood and nobility, those two vital
forces <span id="fr_384"></span>[1](#fn_382.md). 'Winner of growth of
wealth,'--growth of wealth means abundance: he thereby prays for
abundance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:18">3:6:1:18</span></span>18. He
then presses it firmly all round, with, 'Uphold thou the priesthood!
uphold the nobility, uphold our life, uphold our progeny!' this is the
blessing of this rite: that blessing he thereby invokes. He presses it
so as to be level with the ground: with an (ordinary) hole (round trees
for watering) it is higher than the ground, but in this way it is with
the gods;--and thus it is not planted in an (ordinary) hole.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:19">3:6:1:19</span></span>19. He
then pours water thereon;--wherever, in digging, they wound or injure
this (earth),--water being a means of soothing,--there he soothes it by
that means of soothing, water, there he heals it by water: therefore he
pours water thereon.

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:20">3:6:1:20</span></span>20. He
then makes (the sacrificer) say, while touching it thus (Vâ*g*. S. V,
28), 'Thou art firm: may this sacrificer be firm in this homestead
through progeny'--or, 'through cattle!' thus whatever wish he entertains
that wish is accomplished unto him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:21">3:6:1:21</span></span>21.
Thereupon, having taken clarified butter with the dipping-spoon, he
pours it upon the (forked) top <span id="fr_385"></span>[1](#fn_383.md),
with 'O Heaven and Earth, be ye full of ghee!' whereby he endows the
heaven and the earth with strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on
them: upon them thus full of sap and affording subsistence, these
creatures subsist.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:22">3:6:1:22</span></span>22. He
then lays on a mat <span id="fr_386"></span>[2](#fn_384.md), with, 'Thou
art Indra's mat,'--for the Sadas belongs to Indra,--'a shelter to every
one,' for Brâhmans of all families sit therein. He adds two mats, one on
each side thereof, and three north of them and three further (to the
north): these make nine. For the sacrifice

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

is threefold and nine also is threefold: for this reason there are nine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:23">3:6:1:23</span></span>23.
That Sadas has its tie-beams running (from south) to north, and the
cart-shed (from west) to east. For this, the cart-shed, belongs
exclusively to the gods: hence neither food nor drink is taken therein,
because it belongs exclusively to the gods; and were any one either to
eat or to drink therein, his head would verily burst asunder. But those
two, the Âgnîdhra and the Sadas, are common (to the gods and men): hence
food and drink is taken in these two, because they are common (to the
gods and men). Now the north is the quarter of men: therefore the Sadas
has its tie-beams running (from south) to north.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:24">3:6:1:24</span></span>24.
They enclose it <span id="fr_387"></span>[1](#fn_385.md), with the text
(Vâ*g*. S. V, 29; Rig-veda I, 10, 12), 'May these songs encompass thee
on every side, O thou that delightest in songs! May these favours be
favourably received by thee, invigorating the vigorous!' He that
delights in songs, forsooth, is Indra, and songs mean the people: he
thus surrounds the nobility with the people, and therefore the nobility
is here surrounded on both sides by the people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:25">3:6:1:25</span></span>25.
Thereupon he sews (the hurdles to the posts) with a needle and
cord <span id="fr_388"></span>[2](#fn_386.md), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. V,
30), 'Thou art Indra's sewer.' With, 'Thou art Indra's fixed (point),'
he then makes a knot, 'lest it should fall asunder.' He undoes it again,
when the work is completed; and thus disease befalls not either the
Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer. When completed, he

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

touches it (the Sadas) with, 'Thou art Indra's own!' for the Sadas
belongs to Indra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:26">3:6:1:26</span></span>26. In
the north--with regard to the back part of the Soma-carts <span
id="fr_389"></span>[1](#fn_387)--he then raises the Âgnîdhra (shed.md). One
half of it should be inside the altar, and one half outside; or more
than one half may be inside the altar and less outside; or the whole of
it may be inside the altar. When completed, he touches it with, 'Thou
art the All-gods’ own!' To the All-gods it belongs, because on the day
before (the Soma feast) the All-gods abide in it by the Vasatîvarî
water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:27">3:6:1:27</span></span>27.
Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid
of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas. The Asura-Rakshas
attacked them from the south and forced them out of the Sadas, and
overturned those hearths (dhish*n*ya) of theirs which are within the
Sadas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:28">3:6:1:28</span></span>28.
For, indeed, all of those (hearths) at one time burnt as brightly as
this Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya and the Âgnîdhrîya; but ever since
that time when they (the Asuras) overturned them they do not burn. They
forced them (the gods) back to the Âgnîdhra (fire) and even won from
them one half of the Âgnîdhra. From there the All-gods gained
immortality <span id="fr_390"></span>[2](#fn_388.md),--whence it (the
Âgnîdhra fire) is sacred to the All-gods.

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:1:29">3:6:1:29</span></span>29. The
gods kindled them again, as one would (light the fire where he is going
to) stay. Therefore they are kindled at every Soma feast. Wherefore the
duties of the Agnîdh should be discharged by one who is accomplished.
Now he who is known and learned in sacred lore <span
id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_389.md) is truly accomplished: hence they take
to the Agnîdh his Dakshi*n*â first <span
id="fr_392"></span>[2](#fn_390.md), since it is from thence (from the
Agnîdh's fire) that the gods gained immortality. And if weakness were to
come upon one of those that are consecrated, let (the Adhvaryu) say,
'Lead him to the Âgnîdhra!'--thinking 'that is unscathed, there he will
not meet with affliction <span id="fr_393"></span>[3](#fn_391.md).' And
because the All-gods gained immortality from there, therefore it is
sacred to the All-gods.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_378"></span>[140:3](sbe2623.htm#fr_380.md) The Sadas is a shed
or tent, facing the east with its long side, which is to measure
eighteen (or twenty-one, or twenty-four, or, according to the
*S*ulva-sûtra, twenty-seven) cubits, the breadth by <span
id="page_141">p. 141</span> six cubits (or ten, or one half that of the
long side). The udumbara post, according to some, is to stand exactly in
the centre of the shed; or, according to others, at an equal distance
from the (long) east and west sides; the 'spine' (cf. [p.
112](sbe2619.htm#page_112), note [2](sbe2619.htm#fn_294).md) in that case
dividing the building into two equal parts, a northern and a southern
one. In the middle the shed is to be of the sacrificer's height, and
from thence the ceiling is to slant towards the ends where it is to
reach up to the sacrificer's navel. According to the Black Ya*g*us, the
erection of the Sadas precedes the digging of the Uparavas, described in
the preceding Brâhma*n*a. Taitt. S. VI, 2, 10, 11.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[141:1](sbe2623.htm#fr_381.md) The anta*h*pâta,
see [III, 5, I, 1](sbe2619.htm#3:5:1:1.md).

<span id="fn_380"></span>[142:1](sbe2623.htm#fr_382.md) It is the part
which is to stand above ground that is to be of the sacrificer's size.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[143:1](sbe2623.htm#fr_383.md) Svâru*h*,
'naturally grown,' Taitt. S. VI, 2, 10, 4.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[144:1](sbe2623.htm#fr_384.md) See [III, 5, 2,
11](sbe2620.htm#3:5:2:11.md) with note. The Kâ*n*va text has, bahvî vâ
â*s*îr ya*g*u*h*shu te asmâ ete â*s*ishâ vâ *s*âste yad brahma *k*a
kshatra*m* *k*a.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[145:1](sbe2623.htm#fr_385.md) The post is to be
furcate at the top, and between the branch-stumps (forming as it were
its ears) he is to put a piece of gold and pour the ghee thereon; when
the ghee reaches the ground, he is to pronounce the final 'Svâhâ!' in
accordance with the practice at the homas; the gold representing, as it
were, the sacrificial fire. Sâya*n*a on Taitt. S. I, 3, I; Kâty. VIII,
5, 37 seq.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[145:2](sbe2623.htm#fr_386.md) That is, after
putting up the posts of the front and back doors, and laying the beams
on, both longways and crossways, in the same way as was done in erecting
the Prâ*k*înava*ms*a and Havirdhâna, he is to spread over the beams the
nine mats that are to form the ceiling,--viz. first the middle, and then
the two others, of the three southern ones, thereupon three alongside
these, across the central part of the shed, and finally the three across
the north side. According to some authorities the central mats are laid
down first, and then those on the south and north sides. See Sâya*n*a on
Taitt. S. I, 3, 1 (p. 450).

<span id="fn_385"></span>[146:1](sbe2623.htm#fr_387.md) Viz. with hurdles,
or upright grass-mats, fastened to the doorposts by means of cord.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[146:2](sbe2623.htm#fr_388.md) See [III, 5, 3,

(apalamba) of the carts, Kâ*n*va rec.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[147:2](sbe2623.htm#fr_390.md) They gained it, as
would seem, by means of the other half of the Âgnîdhra fire. Cf. Ait.
Br. II, 36. Sâya*n*a interprets 'tân apy ardham âgnîdhrasya, *g*igyus'
by, '\[They forced those (gods) back to the Sadas:\] and they (the
gods), having reached the side (ardham = samîpam) of the Âgnîdhra
(fire), conquered the Asuras and won immortality.' The Kâ*n*va rec.
reads:--'Te hâpy âgnîdhrasyârdha*m* *g*igyus to ’rdhân (! read ’rdhâd)
etad vi*s*ve devâ am*ri*tatvam apâ*g*ayan.'

<span id="fn_389"></span>[148:1](sbe2623.htm#fr_391.md) Or, as Sâya*n*a
takes it, 'he who is known (as well-conducted) and a repeater (reader)
of the Veda.'

<span id="fn_390"></span>[148:2](sbe2623.htm#fr_392.md) See [IV, 3, 4,
19](sbe2653.htm#4:3:4:19.md) seq.

will not suffer evil' (ârti*m* na labheta, Sâya*n*a).
