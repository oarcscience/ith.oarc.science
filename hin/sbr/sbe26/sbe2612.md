#### THE BUYING OF SOMA.

### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:1">3:3:2:1</span></span>1. Having
thrown the (earth of the) foot-print (into the pan), he (the Adhvaryu)
washes his hands. Now as to why he washes his hands;--clarified butter
being a thunderbolt, and the Soma being seed, he washes his hands
lest <span id="fr_173"></span>[3](#fn_172) he should injure the seed,
Soma, with the thunderbolt, the ghee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:2">3:3:2:2</span></span>2.
Thereupon he ties the piece of gold to this (finger <span
id="fr_174"></span>[4](#fn_173)). Now, twofold indeed is this
(universe),--there is no third,--the truth and the untruth: the gods are
the truth and men are the untruth. And gold having sprung from Agni's
seed, he ties the gold to this (finger), in order that he may touch the
twigs (of the Soma) with the truth, that he may handle the Soma by means
of the truth.

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:3">3:3:2:3</span></span>3. He
then orders (the sacrificer's men), 'Bring thou the Soma-cloth! bring
thou the Soma-wrapper! bring thou the head-band!' Let some shining
(cloth) be the Soma-cloth; for this is to be his (king Soma's <span
id="fr_175"></span>[1](#fn_174)) garment, and shining indeed is his
garment: and whosoever serves him with a shining (garment), he truly
shines. But he who says, '(Bring) anything whatsoever,' he will indeed
be anything whatsoever: let the Soma-cloth, therefore, be some splendid
(cloth), and the Soma-wrapper one of any kind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:4">3:3:2:4</span></span>4. If he
can get a head-band, let there be a headband; but if he cannot get a
head-band, let him cut off from the Soma-wrapper a piece two or three
fingers long, to serve as the head-band. Either the Adhvaryu or the
Sacrificer takes the Soma-cloth, and some one or other the Soma-wrapper.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:5">3:3:2:5</span></span>5. Now,
in the first place, they pick the king (Soma). A pitcher of water is
placed close to him, and a Brâhman sits beside him <span
id="fr_176"></span>[2](#fn_175). Thither they (the priests and
sacrificer) now proceed eastward.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:6">3:3:2:6</span></span>6. While
they go there, he (the Adhvaryu) makes

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the sacrificer)
say the text (Vâ*g*. S. IV, 24), 'Say thou, for me, unto Soma, "This is
thy gâyatrî-part (bhâga) <span id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_176)!" Say
thou, for me, unto Soma, "This is thy trish*t*ubh-part!" Say thou, for
me, unto Soma, "This is thy *g*ayatî-part!" Say thou, for me, unto Soma,
"Obtain thou the supreme sovereignty of the names of metres!"' Now, when
he (king Soma) is bought, he is bought for one (destination <span
id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_177))--for the sovereignty of the metres, for
the supreme sovereignty of the metres; and when they press him, they
slay him: hereby now he says to him, 'It is for the sovereignty of the
metres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres that I buy thee, not
for slaying thee.' Having gone there, he sits down (behind the Soma)
with his face towards the east.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:7">3:3:2:7</span></span>7. He
touches (the Soma-plants), with, 'Ours thou art,'--thereby he (Soma),
now that he has come (as a guest), becomes as it were one of his (the
sacrificer's) own (people): for this reason he says, 'Ours thou
art;'--'Thy pure (juice) is meet for the draught,' for he will indeed
take therefrom the 'pure draught <span id="fr_179"></span>[3](#fn_178).'
'Let the pickers pick thee!' this he says for the sake of completeness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:8">3:3:2:8</span></span>8. Now
some, on noticing any straw or (piece of) wood (among the Soma-plants),
throw it away. But let him not do this; for--the Soma being the nobility
and the other plants the common people, and the

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

people being the nobleman's food--it would be just as if one were to
take hold of and pull out some (food) he has put in his mouth, and throw
it away. Hence let him merely touch it, with, 'Let the pickers pick
thee!' Those pickers of his do indeed pick it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:9">3:3:2:9</span></span>9. He
then spreads the cloth (over the ox-hide), either twofold or fourfold,
with the fringe towards the east or north. Thereon he metes out the king
(Soma); and because he metes out the king, therefore there is a
measure,--both the measure among men and whatever other measure there
is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:10">3:3:2:10</span></span>10. He
metes out, with a verse to Savit*ri*; for Savit*ri* is the impeller of
the gods, and so that (Soma) becomes for him impelled by Savit*ri* to
the purchase.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:11">3:3:2:11</span></span>11. He
metes out with an ati*kh*andas-verse; for that one, viz. the
ati*kh*andas <span id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_179), embraces all metres;
and so that (Soma) is meted out for him by means of all the metres:
therefore he metes out with an ati*kh*andas-verse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:12">3:3:2:12</span></span>12. He
metes out, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. IV, 25), 'Unto that divine Savit*ri*
within the two bowls <span id="fr_181"></span>[2](#fn_180), the sage, I
sing praises, to him of true

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

impulse, the bestower of treasures, the wise and thoughtful friend;--he
at whose impulse the resplendent light shone high, the golden-handed
sage hath measured the ether with his form.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:13">3:3:2:13</span></span>13.
Therewith <span id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_181) he metes out (the Soma)
with all (five fingers), therewith with four, therewith with three,
therewith with two, therewith with one; therewith with one, therewith
with two, therewith with three, therewith with four, therewith with all
(fingers); having laid (the two hands) together <span
id="fr_183"></span>[2](#fn_182) he throws (Soma) thereon with the joined
open hands.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:14">3:3:2:14</span></span>14. He
metes out while bending up and bending down (the fingers). The reason
why he metes out in bending (the fingers) up and down is that he thereby
makes those fingers of separate existence, and therefore they are born
separate (from each other); and as to his meting out with all (fingers)
together, these (fingers) are to be born, as it were, united. This is
why he metes out in bending (the fingers) up and down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:15">3:3:2:15</span></span>15.
And, again, as to his meting out in bending them up and down,--he
thereby renders them of varied power, and hence these (fingers) are of
varied

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

power. That is why he metes out in bending them up and down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:16">3:3:2:16</span></span>16.
And, again, as to his meting out in bending them up and down,--he
thereby harnesses a virâ*g* <span id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_183) (to
ply) thitherwards and hitherwards: going thither-wards, namely, it
conveys the sacrifice to the gods, and coming hitherwards it assists
men. This is why he metes out in bending (the fingers) up and down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:17">3:3:2:17</span></span>17. And
as to his meting out ten times,--the virâ*g* is of ten syllables, and
the Soma is of virâ*g* nature: for this reason he metes out ten times.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:18">3:3:2:18</span></span>18.
Having gathered up the ends of the Soma-cloth, he (the Adhvaryu) ties
them together by means of the head-band, with, 'For descendants (I tie)
thee;'--for it is indeed for (the purpose of obtaining) descendants that
he buys it (Soma): what (part of man) here is, as it were, compressed
between the head and the shoulders, that he thereby makes it to be for
him (the sacrificer) <span id="fr_185"></span>[2](#fn_184).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:2:19">3:3:2:19</span></span>19. He
then makes a finger-hole in the middle (of the knot), with the text,
'Let the descendants breathe after thee!' For, in compressing (the
cloth), he, as it were, strangles him (Soma and the sacrificer) and
renders him breathless; hereby now he emits his breath from inside, and
after him breathing the descendants also breathe: for this reason he
says, 'Let the descendants breathe after thee.' Thereupon he hands him
(Soma) to the Soma-seller. Now, then, of the bargain.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_172"></span>[63:3](sbe2612.htm#fr_173) The construction in
the original is as usual in the oratio directa.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[63:4](sbe2612.htm#fr_174) Viz. to the nameless
(or ring) finger. Kâty. VII, 6, 27.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[64:1](sbe2612.htm#fr_175) I do not think
'asya' could refer to the sacrificer, in opposition to 'etasya' (Soma);
nor can the latter be construed with the following relative clause 'sa
yo . . .' The Kâ*n*va text reads, Tad yad eva *s*obhanatama*m* tat
somopanahana*m* syâd, vâso by asyaitad bhavati; sa yo haita*k*
*kh*obhanatama*m* kurute, *s*obhate haiva sa*h*, &c.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[64:2](sbe2612.htm#fr_176) The
Pratiprasthât*ri*, in the first place, takes the Soma-plants (from the
seller) and puts them on an ox-hide, dyed red and spread on the ground
at the place (in the east of the hall) where the 'sounding-holes' will
be dug (see [III, 5, 4, 1](sbe2622.htm#3:5:4:1) seq.). The seller of the
Soma, who is to be either of the Kutsa tribe or a *S*ûdra, then picks
the Soma, breaking the plants at the joints. A jar filled with water is
placed in front of the Soma, and a Brâhman (or the assistant of the
Brahman, viz. the Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin) sits down by the (right or
south) side of the Soma. Kâty. VII, 6, 1-6.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[65:1](sbe2612.htm#fr_177) The three parts
refer to the three Savanas, at which the respective metres are used. See
[IV, 3, 2, 7](sbe2651.htm#4:3:2:7) seq.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[65:2](sbe2612.htm#fr_178) Bhâgam appears to
have been lost here, since a play on that word seems to be intended,
which might perhaps be reproduced by lot.' It is given both at the
Kâ*n*va text and at [III, 4, 1, 7](sbe2615.htm#3:4:1:7).

<span id="fn_178"></span>[65:3](sbe2612.htm#fr_179) For the
*S*ukra-graha, see [IV, 2, 1, 1](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:1) seq.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[66:1](sbe2612.htm#fr_180) Ati*kh*andas
('over-metre') is the generic name for the metres which number more than
forty-eight syllables: hence it is said to include all the other metres
which consist of fewer syllables. See VIII, 6, 2, 23, where the term is
explained by atti-*kh*andâ*h* (metre-eater).'

<span id="fn_180"></span>[66:2](sbe2612.htm#fr_181) Or, that divine
invigorator of the two 'o*n*i.' According to the St. Petersb. Dict.,
'o*n*i' would seem to refer to two parts of the Soma-press. Professor
Ludwig takes it to mean 'press-arm' and the 'arm' generally, which suits
very well some of the passages in which the word occurs. Here, in the
loc. or gen. case, it can scarcely mean 'arms' (though Savit*ri*'s two
arms are often referred to as dispelling the darkness and keeping
asunder the spaces, cf. Rig-veda II, 38, 2; IV, 53, 3; 4; VI, 75, 1; 5;
VII, 45, 2), but apparently refers to 'heaven and earth' being thus
equivalent to <span id="page_67">p. 67</span> the two *k*amû (originally
the two receptacles or bowls into which the pressed Soma flows) in
Rig-veda III, 55, 20.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[67:1](sbe2612.htm#fr_182) Viz. with the same
formula, repeating it each time. The meting out of the Soma is done with
the fingers of the right hand, first with all five, and then
successively turning in one (beginning with the thumb), till the little
finger remains with which he takes Soma twice, whereupon he again
successively releases the fingers.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[67:2](sbe2612.htm#fr_183) There is some doubt
as to whether this refers to the preceding 'with all (viz. ten
fingers);' or whether he is to take for the tenth time some Soma with
the five fingers of the right hand, and then once more (without
muttering the text) with the joined hands. See Kâty. VII, 7, 18, 29. The
text seems to be purposely vague.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[68:1](sbe2612.htm#fr_184) The virâ*g* (the
shining' or 'ruling' metre) consists of (generally three or four) pâdas
of ten syllables each: hence it is here connected with the ten metings
out of Soma.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[68:2](sbe2612.htm#fr_185) The Soma
representing offspring, he gives the bundle a shape resembling the human
body.
