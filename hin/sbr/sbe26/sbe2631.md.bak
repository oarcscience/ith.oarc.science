### EIGHTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

##### C. THE OBLATIONS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:1">3:8:1:1</span></span>1.
Thereupon the Hot*ri*, having sat down on the Hot*ri*'s seat whereon he
sits down after being chosen <span id="fr_466"></span>[2](#fn_464.md),

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

urges, and thus urged the Adhvaryu takes the two spoons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:2">3:8:1:2</span></span>2. They
then proceed with the Âprî (verses). The reason why they proceed with
the Âprîs is this. With his whole mind, with his whole self, forsooth,
he who consecrates himself prepares and endeavours to prepare the
sacrifice. His self is, as it were, emptied out; with those Âprîs they
fill it again; and because they fill <span
id="fr_467"></span>[1](#fn_465.md) it therewith, therefore they are called
Âprî. For this reason they proceed with the Âprîs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:3">3:8:1:3</span></span>3. Now
there are here eleven fore-offerings; for here in man there are ten
vital airs, and the eleventh is the self wherein those vital airs are
contained; this is the whole man; thus they fill his whole self, and
therefore there are eleven fore-offerings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:4">3:8:1:4</span></span>4. \[The
Adhvaryu\] having called (on the Âgnîdhra) for the *S*rausha*t*, he says
(to the Maitrâvaru*n*a), 'Prompt (the Hot*ri* to recite to) the
kindling-sticks <span id="fr_468"></span>[2](#fn_466.md)!' Thus he proceeds
with ten fore-offerings,

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

saying, 'Prompt . . .' at each, and pouring the ghee together at every
fourth fore-offering <span id="fr_469"></span>[1](#fn_467.md). Having
performed ten fore-offerings, he says, 'Bring the slayer!' 'Slayer,'
namely, the (butcher's) knife is called.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:5">3:8:1:5</span></span>5. He
then takes the (svaru) chip of the sacrificial stake, and having
anointed both (the slaughtering-knife and the chip) at the top (with
ghee) from the guhû-spoon, he touches the forehead of the victim with
them, saying (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 11), 'Anointed with ghee, protect ye the
animals!' for the chip of the stake is a thunderbolt, and the
slaughtering-knife is a thunderbolt, and ghee is a thunderbolt; having
thus fitted together the entire thunderbolt <span
id="fr_470"></span>[2](#fn_468.md) he appoints it the keeper of this
(victim), lest the evil spirits should injure it. He again conceals the
chip of the stake (under the girding-rope of the stake). In handing the
slaughtering-knife to the butcher, he says, 'Be this thine approved
edge!' and deposits the two spoons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:6">3:8:1:6</span></span>6.
Thereupon he says (to the Hot*ri*), 'Recite to Agni circumambient <span
id="fr_471"></span>[3](#fn_469.md)!' Having taken a firebrand,

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

the Agnîdh carries the fire round (the victim). Why he carries the fire
round, is that he encircles it (the victim) by means of the fire with an
unbroken fence, lest the evil spirits should seize upon it; for Agni is
the repeller of the Rakshas; therefore he carries the fire round. He
carries it round the place where they cook it (the victim <span
id="fr_472"></span>[1](#fn_470).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:7">3:8:1:7</span></span>7. As to
this they say, 'Let him take back that firebrand (to the Âhavanîya); and
having there (at the *S*âmitra) churned out a new fire, let them cook it
(the victim) thereon. For this (firebrand), surely, is âhavanîya (fit to
offer upon); it is not for the purpose that they should cook uncooked
(food) thereon, but for this that they should sacrifice cooked (food)
thereon.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:8">3:8:1:8</span></span>8. Let
him, however, not do this. For in that he carries fire round it, it (the
victim) becomes as food swallowed by that (firebrand), and it would be
as if he were to seize and tear out food that has been swallowed and
offer it to some one else; let them, therefore, crumble some coals off
that same firebrand, and thereon cook that (victim).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:9">3:8:1:9</span></span>9.
Thereupon the Agnîdh, taking a (new) firebrand, walks in front: whereby
he places Agni in front, thinking, 'Agni shall repel the evil spirits in
front!' and

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

they lead the victim after him (to the slaughtering-place) on a (way)
free from danger and injury. The Pratiprasthât*ri* holds on to it from
behind by means of the two spits <span id="fr_473"></span>[1](#fn_471.md),
and the Adhvaryu (holds on to) the Pratiprasthât*ri*, and the Sacrificer
to the Adhvaryu.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:10">3:8:1:10</span></span>10. As
to this they say, 'That (victim) must not be held on to by the
sacrificer, for they lead it unto death; therefore let him not hold on
to it.' But let him nevertheless hold on to it; for that (victim) which
they lead to the sacrifice they lead not to death; therefore let him
hold on to it. Moreover he would cut himself off from the sacrifice,
were he not to hold on to it; therefore let him hold on to it. It is
held on to in a mysterious way; by means of the spits the
Pratiprasthât*ri* (holds on to it); to the Pratiprasthât*ri* the
Adhvaryu, to the Adhvaryu the Sacrificer; thus then it is held on to in
a mysterious way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:11">3:8:1:11</span></span>11.
Thereupon the Adhvaryu takes two stalks of grass from the covered altar,
and having called for the *S*rausha*t*, he says (to the Maitrâvaru*n*a),
'O Hot*ri*, prompt again (the Hot*ri* to recite for) the offerings to
the gods <span id="fr_474"></span>[2](#fn_472.md)!' This is what belongs to
the All-gods at the animal offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:12">3:8:1:12</span></span>12. He
then makes (the Sacrificer) say the text (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 11), 'O thou
prosperous! upon

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

the Sacrificer,'--the prosperous one, forsooth, is Speech, it is because
she speaks much, that Speech is prosperous,--'bestow thou what is
agreeable unto him! Approach thou,'--thereby he means to say, 'Approach
thou an existence free from affliction,'--'from the wide air, along with
the divine wind;' for the Rakshas moves about the air rootless and
unfettered on both sides, even as man here moves about the air rootless
and unfettered on both sides: he means to say, 'Meeting together with
the wind, protect thou this one from the wide air,' when he says 'from
the wide air, along with the divine wind.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:13">3:8:1:13</span></span>13.
'Offer thou with the self of this oblation!' whereby he means to say to
Speech, 'Offer thou with the soul of this unblemished oblation;'--'Unite
thou with its body!' whereby he means to say to Speech, 'Unite thou with
the body of this unblemished oblation!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:14">3:8:1:14</span></span>14. In
front <span id="fr_475"></span>[1](#fn_473.md) of the place where they cut
it up, he throws down a stalk of grass, with, 'O great one, lead the
lord of sacrifice unto greater sacrifice!' he thus strews barhis (an
underlayer of sacrificial grass) for it, that no sacrificial food may be
spilt; whatever may now be spilt of it when it is cut up, that settles
thereon and thus is not lost.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:15">3:8:1:15</span></span>15.
They then step back (to the altar) and sit down turning towards the
Âhavanîya, 'lest they should be eye-witnesses to its being quieted
(strangled).' They do not slay it on the frontal bone <span
id="fr_476"></span>[2](#fn_474.md), for that is human

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

manner; nor behind the ear, for that is after the manner of the Fathers.
They either choke it by merely keeping its mouth closed, or they make a
noose. Therefore he says not, 'Slay! kill!' for that is human manner,
but, 'Quiet it! It has passed away!' for that is after the manner of the
gods. For when he says, 'It has passed away,' then this one (the
Sacrificer) passes away to the gods: therefore he says, 'It has passed
away.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:1:16">3:8:1:16</span></span>16.
When they hold it down, then, before the strangling, he offers with
'Hail, to the gods!' And when (the butcher) says, 'Quieted is the
victim,' he offers with, 'To the gods, Hail!' Thus some of the gods are
preceded by 'Hail,' and others followed by 'Hail;' he thereby gratifies
them, and thus gratified both kinds of gods convey him to the heavenly
world. These are the so-called 'paripa*s*avya <span
id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_475.md)' oblations; he may offer them if he
choose; or, if he choose, he need not mind them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_464"></span>[184:2](sbe2631.htm#fr_466.md) Viz. at the
north-west corner (or left hip) of the altar. For the formulas used by
him, see I, 5, 1, 24-2, 1.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[185:1](sbe2631.htm#fr_467.md) The text has only
'âpyâyayanti,' but the verb with which the author connects the verb
'âprî' is either â-p*rin*âti, he fills; or (more correctly)
'â-prî*n*âti,' he gratifies, propitiates, corresponding to the Zand
âfrînaiti. Perhaps some words have been lost here. The Kâ*n*va text has:
sa yad etâbhir âprîbhi*h* punar âpyâyata etâbhir enam âpri*n*âti tasmâd
âpriyo nâma. On the Âprî verses, which form the offering-prayers
(yâ*g*yâs) at the fore-offerings of the animal sacrifice, and vary
according to different families, see Ait. Br. II, 4; Max Müller, Hist.
of A. S. L., p. 463 seq.; Haug, Essays, p. 24r.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[185:2](sbe2631.htm#fr_468.md) See I, 5, 3, 8. The
Adhvaryu calls out to the Agnîdh, 'O *s*râvaya (make listen)!' The
Agnîdh calls out, 'Astu *s*rausha*t* (yea, may one hear)!' The Adhvaryu
calls on the Maitrâvaru*n*a, 'Preshya samidha*h* (prompt as to the
kindling-sticks)!' \[or, 'Preshya Tanûnapâtam or Narâ*s*a*m*sam' &c. in
the succeeding fore-offerings.\] The Maitrâvaru*n*a calls out, 'Hotâ
yakshat samidham \[Tanûnapâtam, &c.\], (let the Hot*ri* pronounce the
offering-prayer to the kindling-sticks, &c,!)' Each offering-prayer
(Âprî) is introduced <span id="page_186">p. 186</span> with the formula
'Ye ya*g*âmahe, &c.' See part i, p.148 note. The divine objects of these
oblations of ghee are: 1. the Samidhs or kindling-sticks; 2. either
Tanûnapât or Narâ*s*a*m*sa; 3. the I*d*as; 4. the Barhis (sacrificial
grass on the altar); 5. the gates (of heaven and worshipping ground); 6.
Dawn and Night; 7. the two divine Hot*ri*s; 8. the three goddesses
(Sarasvatî, I*d*â, and Bhâratî); 9. Tvash*tri*; 10. Vanaspati (the tree,
or lord of the forest); 11. the Svâhâk*ri*tis (calls of 'All-hail,'
which at this, the last offering-prayer, are repeated before the names
of the principal deities of the sacrifice). For this last fore-offering,
see [III, 8, 2, 23](sbe2632.htm#3:8:2:23.md) seq.

<span id="fn_467"></span>[186:1](sbe2631.htm#fr_469.md) See I, 5, 3, 16.

<span id="fn_468"></span>[186:2](sbe2631.htm#fr_470.md) For the three parts
of the thunderbolt, see [p. 108](sbe2618.htm#page_108.md), note
[2](sbe2618.htm#fn_285.md).

<span id="fn_469"></span>[186:3](sbe2631.htm#fr_471.md) The Hot*ri* recites
the triplet, Rig-veda IV, 15, 1-3.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[187:1](sbe2631.htm#fr_472.md) Sâya*n*a seems to
take 'abhipariharati' in the sense of 'he takes it round to the place
where they cook.' According to Kâty. VI, 5, 2, 3, the Agnîdh
circumambulates thrice from left to right, either the place comprising
the victim, the ghee, the slaughtering-place, the sacrificial post, the
*k*âtvâla, and Âhavanîya; or only the ghee, the victim, and
slaughtering-place. He then throws the firebrand back on the Âhavanîya,
and performs the circumambulation as many times in the opposite
direction. On the Paryagnikara*n*a, see also part i, p. 45 note.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[188:1](sbe2631.htm#fr_473.md) For the two
omentum-spits, see note on [III, 8, 2, 16](sbe2632.htm#3:8:2:16.md).

<span id="fn_472"></span>[188:2](sbe2631.htm#fr_474.md) The
Maitrâvaru*n*a's additional cue or order (upapraisha) is 'Agni has been
victorious; he has won wealth!' On the Hot*ri*'s recitation--the
so-called Adhrigu litany--commencing 'Ye divine quieters (slaughterers),
commence, as well as ye that are human!' and consisting of formulas
usually pronounced by the Adhvaryu (and hence perhaps going back to a
time when the Hot*ri* had to perform all but the menial parts of the
sacrificial service), see Ait. Br. II, 6-7; Roth, Yâska XXXVII seq.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[189:1](sbe2631.htm#fr_475.md) According to Kâty.
VI, 5, 15, the stalk is put down behind the *S*âmitra (i.e. the fire at
the slaughtering-place) with the top towards the east.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[189:2](sbe2631.htm#fr_476.md) Lit. 'by means of
the frontal bone.' Sâya*n*a explains it by 'in <span id="page_190">p.
190</span> seizing it by the horn;' Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p.
222, 'by striking it with a horn.' The Kâ*n*va text reads, tasya na
kû*t*ena praghnanti mânusha*m* ha kuryâd yad asya kû*t*ena prahanyu*h*.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[190:1](sbe2631.htm#fr_477.md) That is,
surrounding, relating to, the victim.
