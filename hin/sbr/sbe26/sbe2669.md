### TENTH BRÂHMA*N*A <span id="fr_982"></span>[3](#fn_976).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:10:1">4:5:10:1</span></span>1. If
the Soma is carried off, let him say, 'Run about and seek!' If they find
it, why should they care? But if they do not find it, atonement is made
therefore.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:10:2">4:5:10:2</span></span>2. Now
there are two kinds of Phâlguna plants,

<span id="page_422">p. 422</span>

the red-flowering and the brown-flowering. Those Phâlguna plants which
have brown flowers one may press; for they, the brown-flowering
Phâlgunas, are akin to the Soma-plant: therefore he may press those with
brown flowers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:10:3">4:5:10:3</span></span>3. If
they cannot get brown-flowering (Phâlgunas), he may press the
Syenah*ri*ta <span id="fr_983"></span>[1](#fn_977) plant. For when
Gâyatrî flew up for Soma, a sprig of Soma fell from her, as she was
bringing him: it became the Syenah*ri*ta plant: therefore he may press
the Syenah*ri*ta plant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:10:4">4:5:10:4</span></span>4. If
they cannot get the *S*yenah*ri*ta, he may press Âdâra plants. For when
the head of the sacrifice was cut off, then Âdâra plants sprung from the
sap which spirted from it: therefore he may press Âdâra plants.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:10:5">4:5:10:5</span></span>5. If
they cannot get Âdâras, he may press brown Dûb (dûrvâ) plants, for they,
the brown Dûb plants, are akin to the Soma: therefore he may press brown
Dûb plants.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:10:6">4:5:10:6</span></span>6. If
they cannot get brown Dûb plants, he may also press any kind of yellow
Ku*s*a plants. In that case let him also give one cow; and, when he
comes out of the purificatory bath, let him again become consecrated,
for the atonement for that (use of plants other than Soma) is a second
sacrifice. So much then as to those robbed of their Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:10:7">4:5:10:7</span></span>7. Now
as to those who burst their Soma-trough (kala*s*a). If the trough
bursts, let him say, 'Try to catch it!' If they catch a handful or a
goupenful <span id="fr_984"></span>[2](#fn_978) (of Soma), let them
perform, as far as is in their power <span
id="fr_985"></span>[3](#fn_979),

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

after pouring (water) to it from other ekadhana pitchers. But if they do
not catch any, let them perform, as far as is in their power, after
pouring out some of the Âgraya*n*a and pouring (water) thereto from
other ekadhana pitchers. And if the trough bursts before the dakshi*n*â
(cows) have been led up, let him then give one cow; and after coming out
from the purificatory bath, let him be consecrated again; for the
atonement for that (mishap) is a second sacrifice. So much then as to
those who burst the trough.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:10:8">4:5:10:8</span></span>8. Then
as to those by whom any Soma is left over. If any (Soma) be left after
the Agnish*t*oma, let him draw the Ukthya cup from the Pûtabh*ri*t. If
any be left after the Ukthya, let him undertake the Sho*d*a*s*in. If any
be left after the Sho*d*a*s*in, let them undertake a night
(performance) <span id="fr_986"></span>[1](#fn_980). If any be left
after the night (performance), let them undertake a day
(performance) <span id="fr_987"></span>[2](#fn_981). But nothing,
surely, remains after that <span id="fr_988"></span>[3](#fn_982).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_976"></span>[421:3](sbe2669.htm#fr_982) In the Kâ*n*va text
I have met with nothing corresponding to this Brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_977"></span>[422:1](sbe2669.htm#fr_983) That is, the plant
'carried away by the falcon (or eagle).'

<span id="fn_978"></span>[422:2](sbe2669.htm#fr_984) Scotch for the
measure of both hands placed side by side; Ags. geap, Low Germ. göpse.

<span id="fn_979"></span>[422:3](sbe2669.htm#fr_985) Yathâprabhâvam:
Kâty. XXV, 12, 24 seems to take it in the <span id="page_432">p.
432</span> sense of 'abundantly,' as he circumscribes it by
'prabhâvayanta*h*' (which the commentator explains by 'distributing over
the several vessels').

<span id="fn_980"></span>[423:1](sbe2669.htm#fr_986) That is, he is to
perform an Atirâtra, see [p. 397](sbe2661.htm#page_397), note
[2](sbe2662.htm#fn_928).

<span id="fn_981"></span>[423:2](sbe2669.htm#fr_987) Kâty. XXV, 13,
52-14, in that emergency, prescribes either the B*ri*hat-sâman (by which
a seventeenth stotra is obtained at the Vâ*g*apeya sacrifice, for which
see more in Kâ*nd*a V), or the Mahâvrata (see [IV, 6, 4,
1](sbe2673.htm#4:6:4:1), with note [2](sbe2673.htm#fn_995)), or the
Aptoryâma (see [p. 398](sbe2662.htm#page_398), note
[2](sbe2662.htm#fn_928)).

<span id="fn_982"></span>[423:3](sbe2669.htm#fr_988) The meaning of this
seems to be, that after the Aptoryâma, no other sacrifice remains at
which he could dispose of any Soma that might be left (and hence one
must finish it at that sacrifice). According to Kâty. ib. 15, he is to
repeat the Aptoryâma, if any Soma remains after the first performance.
