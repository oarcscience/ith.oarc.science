### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

##### C. THE. MÂDHYANDINA SAVANA, OR MIDDAY SOMA FEAST.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:1">4:3:3:1</span></span>1. He
presses out (the Soma juice) with 'Ihā̃! Ihā̃ <span
id="fr_787"></span>[2](#fn_784)!' (hither.md), whereby he draws Indra nigh;
and

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

with 'B*ri*hat! B*ri*hat!' (great), whereby he draws Indra <span
id="fr_788"></span>[1](#fn_785.md) nigh.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:2">4:3:3:2</span></span>2. The
*S*ukra and Manthin grahas he draws first, for thereby the Soma feast
comes to be supplied with pure Soma (*s*ukra). Thereupon the Âgraya*n*a,
for that (cup) is drawn at all (three) feasts. Then the Marutvatîya cup;
then the Ukthya, for here also there are songs of praise (Uktha) <span
id="fr_789"></span>[2](#fn_786.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:3">4:3:3:3</span></span>3. Now
some draw the Marutvatîya after they have drawn the Ukthya; but let him.
not do this,--let him rather draw the Ukthya after he has drawn the
Marutvatîya.

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:4">4:3:3:4</span></span>4. These,
then, are five grahas he draws; for that midday Pavamâna chant is a
thunderbolt: hence it is a fifteenfold five-hymned chant <span
id="fr_790"></span>[1](#fn_787.md), for the thunderbolt is
fifteenfold <span id="fr_791"></span>[2](#fn_788.md). He is so by means of
these five grahas (cups of Soma <span id="fr_792"></span>[3](#fn_789).md):
for five are these fingers, and with the fingers he hurls (the
thunderbolt).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:5">4:3:3:5</span></span>5. Indra
hurled the thunderbolt at V*ri*tra; and having smitten V*ri*tra, the
wicked, and safety and peace being secured <span
id="fr_793"></span>[4](#fn_790.md), he led forth the dakshi*n*âs (gifts to
priests). Wherefore now also, when they (the Udgât*ri*s) chant the
midday Pavamâna, and safety and peace are secured, the dakshi*n*âs are
led forth. And so, forsooth, does he now by means of those five cups of
Soma hurl the thunderbolt at the wicked, hateful enemy, and having
smitten V*ri*tra, the wicked, and safety and peace being

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

secured, he leads forth the dakshi*n*âs. This is why he draws those five
cups.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:6">4:3:3:6</span></span>6. Then
as to why he draws the Marutvatîya cups. Now this, the midday pressing
feast, is Indra's special (nishkevalya) feast: thereby he strove to
smite V*ri*tra, thereby he strove to vanquish him. But the Maruts,
having on that account <span id="fr_794"></span>[1](#fn_791.md) withdrawn,
were standing on an A*s*vattha tree <span
id="fr_795"></span>[2](#fn_792) (Ficus Religiosa.md). Now Indra is the
nobility, and the Maruts are the people, and through the people the
noble becomes strong: therefore the two Ritu cups (they say) <span
id="fr_796"></span>[3](#fn_793.md) may be of a*s*vattha wood; but in
reality they are of kârshmarya wood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:7">4:3:3:7</span></span>7. Indra
called on them, saying, 'Do ye join me that with you as my force I may
smite V*ri*tra!' They said, 'What will be our (reward) then?' He drew
those two Marutvatîya cups for them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:8">4:3:3:8</span></span>8. They
said, 'Having put aside this one (cup) for our vigour, we will join
thee.' Having accordingly put it aside for their vigour <span
id="fr_797"></span>[4](#fn_794.md), they joined him. But Indra sought to
obtain it, thinking, 'They have come to me after putting aside their
vigour.'

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:9">4:3:3:9</span></span>9. He
said, 'Do ye join me with vigour!'--'Then draw a third cup for us;' they
said. He drew a third cup for them, with, 'Thou art taken with a
support,--thee for the vigour of the Maruts!' They then joined him with
vigour,--and he conquered with them, and smote V*ri*tra with them;--for
Indra is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people, and through the
people the noble becomes strong. Hence he now bestows that strength on
the nobility, and therefore he draws the Marutvatîya cups.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:10">4:3:3:10</span></span>10. Let
him draw them for Indra Marutvat (accompanied by the Maruts), and not
for the Maruts likewise. For were he also to draw cups for the Maruts,
he would make the people refractory to the nobility. He thus assigns to
the Maruts a share therein after Indra, whereby he makes the people
subservient and obedient to the nobility: therefore let him draw the
cups for Indra Marutvat, and not for the Maruts likewise.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:11">4:3:3:11</span></span>11. But
he was afraid of their desertion,--'Lest they should desert me, lest
they should take to some other (party) <span
id="fr_798"></span>[1](#fn_795.md),' so thinking, he by that (share in the
libation) made them unwilling to desert him. This is why he should draw
the grahas for Indra Marutvat.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:12">4:3:3:12</span></span>12. He
draws them with the two vessels of the seasons, for the year, the
sacrifice, means the seasons. There, at the morning Soma feast, they are
overtly attended to, in that he draws the grahas for the seasons <span
id="fr_799"></span>[2](#fn_796.md); and now they are covertly attended

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

to, in that he draws the Marutvatîya grahas with the two vessels of the
seasons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:13">4:3:3:13</span></span>13. He
draws (the first) from that (stream of Soma) <span
id="fr_800"></span>[1](#fn_797.md), with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 35; Rig-veda III,
51, 7), 'O Indra, leader of the Maruts, drink thou the Soma here, as
thou drankest of the liquor at (the sacrifice of) the Son of Saryâti: by
thy guidance, in thy protection, O Lord, do the wise serve thee with
good offerings!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra
Marutvat!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Marutvat!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:14">4:3:3:14</span></span>14.
\[The second he draws <span id="fr_801"></span>[2](#fn_798.md) with Vâ*g*.
S. VII, 36;

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rig-veda III, 47,
5\], 'The mighty bull, followed by the Maruts, the bountiful, divine
ruler Indra,--him, the all-subduing, the terrible bestower of victory,
do we now invoke for new favour.--Thou art taken with a support: thee to
Indra Marutvat!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Marutvat!'--with Thou
art

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

taken with a support: thee for the strength of the Maruts!' he draws the
third cup.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:15">4:3:3:15</span></span>15.
Thereupon he draws the Mâhendra cup. For Indra was then bound up with
evil, in the shape of the people, the Maruts; as one might, for the sake
of victory, eat from the same vessel with the people <span
id="fr_802"></span>[1](#fn_799.md) so it was when they drew a cup for him
in common with the Maruts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:16">4:3:3:16</span></span>16.
When all was conquered and free from danger and injury, the gods plucked
him from out of all evil--even as one might pluck out a reed from its
sheath--when they drew the cup for the Great Indra. And even as the reed
becomes leafless, so is he thereby freed from all evil, when one draws
the Mâhendra cup.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:17">4:3:3:17</span></span>17. And
again, why he draws the Mâhendra cup. Before the slaughter of V*ri*tra,
he was indeed Indra; but when he had slain V*ri*tra, he became the
Great--Indra, even as one who has conquered all around, becomes a Great
King (mahârâ*g*a): therefore he draws the Mâhendra cup. And, moreover,
he forsooth make's him great for the slaughter of V*ri*tra therefore
also he draws the Mâhendra cup. He draws it in the *S*ukra vessel, for
bright (*s*ukra) and great indeed is he (the sun) that burns yonder:
therefore he draws it in the *S*ukra vessel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:18">4:3:3:18</span></span>18. He
thus draws it from that (Dro*n*akala*s*a or Pûtabh*ri*t), with (Vâ*g*.
S. VII, 39; Rig-veda VI, 19, 1), 'Great is Indra and hero-like,
gladdening the people, of double stature and unimpaired in power. For
our sake he waxed strong for heroic deed,--great and broad was he, and

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

well-shapen by the shapers <span id="fr_803"></span>[1](#fn_800.md).--Thou
art taken with a support: thee to Mahendra!'--with 'This is thy womb:
thee to Mahendra!' he deposits it; for it is indeed for the Great Indra
that he draws it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:3:19">4:3:3:19</span></span>19. And
having bespoken (the chant <span id="fr_804"></span>[2](#fn_801).md), he
says this speech,--'Pressers, press ye! make the mortars

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

resound! Agnîdh, stir the sour milk! be thou mindful of Soma's (pap)!'
It is for the evening's press-feast that those pressers press out (the
Soma juice), for the evening feast they make the mortars resound, for
the evening feast the Agnîdh stirs the sour milk, for the evening feast
he boils the pap for Soma. For these two press-feasts, the morning feast
and the midday feast, are indeed rich in pure Soma, are rich in juice;
but that third press-feast is emptied of the pure Soma. Hence he forms
it from out of this midday feast; and thus that third press-feast
becomes for him rich in pure Soma, rich in juice: this is why he now
speaks that speech.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_784"></span>[331:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_787.md) 'Iha' (here,
hither) with the last syllable protracted. The Hot*ri*'s cup with the
Nigrâbhyâ (vasatîvarî) water having been handed to the sacrificer, and
the fillet or band (ush*n*îsha) with which the Soma-plants are tied
together, to the Grâvastut, the pressing is performed in the same way as
the 'great pressing,' at <span id="page_332">p. 332</span> the
Prâta*h*savana (see [p. 256](sbe2640.htm#page_256.md), note
[1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619).md). Meanwhile the Grâvastut takes the band, and
winds it thrice round his head and face from left to right. And whenever
Soma-stalks are taken out for pressing he extols the stones by chanting
the Grâva-stotra or 'praise of the stones.' According to Â*s*v. *S*r. V,
12; Ait. Br. VI, 7, 2, this chant consists of the verses Rig-veda I, 24,
3; V, 81, 1; VIII, 81, 1; VIII, 1, 1, followed by the hymn X, 94,
ascribed to the serpent *Ri*shi Arbuda. Before the last verse of this
hymn he inserts the hymns X, 76 and X, 175, (ascribed to the serpents
*G*aratkar*n*a and Arbuda respectively); and either before, or between,
or after these two hymns he throws in the pâvamânî*h* (Rig-veda IX)
according to requirement, till the pressing is completed, or the
libations are to be drawn, when having wound up with the last verse of
the first Arbuda hymn, he makes over the band to the sacrificer. The
five cups mentioned in [paragraph 2](sbe2652.htm#4:3:3:2.md) are filled
from the stream of Soma flowing from the Hot*ri*'s cup into the
Dro*n*akala*s*a; the Âgraya*n*a ([p. 294](sbe2647.htm#page_294.md), note
[2](sbe2647.htm#fn_708).md) however being taken (in the Âgraya*n*a sthâlî
or bowl) from that and two other streams, poured by the Unnet*ri* from
the Âdhavanîya, and by the Pratiprasthât*ri* from some vessel containing
the Soma previously kept in the Âgraya*n*a sthâlî.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[332:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_788.md) Probably on account
of the connection of the B*ri*hat-sâman with Indra; see part i, p.196,
note 2.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[332:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_789.md) See [p.
294](sbe2647.htm#page_294), note [2](sbe2647.htm#fn_708.md). Sâya*n*a here
curiously explains the term by 'stotrâ*n*i.'

<span id="fn_787"></span>[333:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_790.md) The
Mâdhyandina-pavamâna-stotra, Sâmav. II, 22-29, is made up of three hymns
(sûkta), consisting of three gâyatrî (22-24), two b*ri*hatî (and
satob*ri*hatî, 25, 26), and three trish*t*ubh verses (27-29)
respectively. These are chanted in such a way as to produce five Sâman
hymns (i.e. a hymn of three verses), viz. the gâyatrî triplet is chanted
twice, in the Gâyatra and Âmahîyava tunes;--the b*ri*hatî-satob*ri*hatî
couplet is likewise chanted twice, in the Raurava and Yaudhâ*g*aya
tunes, the two verses being as usual (by the repetition of certain
pâdas) made into three. These, with the addition of the trish*t*ubh
hymn, chanted in the Au*s*ana tune, make five Sâman hymns of three
verses each, or altogether fifteen verses (pa*ñk*ada*s*astoma).

<span id="fn_788"></span>[333:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_791.md) Or consists of the
fifteenfold (chant), as Sâya*n*a takes it. Regarding the connection
between the pa*ñk*ada*s*a-stoma (the characteristic stoma of the midday
pressing) and Indra (the deity of the midday pressing), see part i,
introd. p. xviii.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[333:3](sbe2652.htm#fr_792.md) Perhaps graha' has
here a double meaning, viz. 'that which is taken, a draught, cup of
Soma,' and 'the taker, seizer.'

<span id="fn_790"></span>[333:4](sbe2652.htm#fr_793.md) See [p.
289](sbe2646.htm#page_289), note [4](sbe2646.htm#fn_700.md).

<span id="fn_791"></span>[334:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_794.md) Lit. 'thus;'
'iti*s*abdenâpakrama*n*aprakâro ’bhinayena pradar*s*yate,' Sây.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[334:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_795.md) This passage would
seem to be based on a mistaken interpretation of Rig-veda I, 13 5, 8,
where the bard says that 'the victorious (*g*âyava*h*) have come nigh to
the a*s*vattha,' the '*g*âyava*h*' here evidently referring (not to the
Maruts, as in I, 1 19, 3), but to the powerful draughts of Soma flowing
into the a*s*vattha vessel. The Kâ*n*va text reads, Sâ (i.e. vi*s*, the
people or Maruts) hâ*s*vatthe tish*th*ate.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[334:3](sbe2652.htm#fr_796.md) The Kâ*n*va text
inserts 'ity âhu*h*.'

<span id="fn_794"></span>[334:4](sbe2652.htm#fr_797.md) The context seems
to be purposely ambiguous, as it may also be construed thus: They said,
'After putting aside this (cup), we will come (attain) to strength.'
Having accordingly put it aside, they came to strength.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[335:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_798.md) For the
construction, see [p. 33](sbe2607.htm#page_33.md), note
[1](sbe2607.htm#fn_91.md).

<span id="fn_796"></span>[335:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_799.md) See [IV, 3, 1,
3](sbe2650.htm#4:3:1:3.md) seq.

<span id="fn_797"></span>[336:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_800.md) See [p.
331](sbe2651.htm#page_331), note [2](#fn_784.md).

<span id="fn_798"></span>[336:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_801.md) Here the author
again anticipates, important parts of the performance being not even
referred to. On the present occasion only one Marutvatîya cup is drawn
and deposited on the mound (khara). The Ukthya cup having then been
drawn and deposited, the priests leave the Havirdhâna in the same way as
at the morning performance (see [IV, 2, 5, 1](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:1.md), with
note), and perform the Vipru*d*-homas, or drop-offerings. Thereupon the
priests 'creep' (sarp), with their upper bodies bent parallel to the
ground, to the Sadas, where, near the Udumbara post, the chanting of the
midday Pavamâna-stotra now takes place after the necessary
preliminaries. If the Pravargya has been performed on the preceding day
(see [III, 4, 4, 1](sbe2618.htm#3:4:4:1), with note.md), the Dadhi-gharma,
or libation of hot milk mixed with sour milk, is now made. Then follow
the oblations from the Savanîya-puro*d*â*s*a (see [IV, 2, 5,
15](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:15) seq., and [p. 323](sbe2650.htm#page_323.md), note
). Thereupon filling of the cups of the ten *K*amasins, and the
libations from (and drinking of) the *S*ukra and Manthin cups. After the
eating of the I*d*â of the puro*d*â*s*as, the Dâkshi*n*a-homas and
distribution of the sacrificial fees take place, as set forth in the
next Brâhma*n*a. Thereupon the Adhvaryu calls on the Maitrâvaru*n*a to
pronounce the invitatory prayer to Indra Marutvat (viz. Rig-veda III,
51, 7), 'O Indra, attended by the Maruts, here drink the Soma,' &c.,
followed by the order (praisha), 'Let the Hot*ri* pronounce the offering
prayer to Indra Marutvat!' <span id="page_337">p. 337</span> The
Pratiprasthât*ri* now draws a second Marutvatîya cup in the other
Ritu-pâtra. The offering prayer (Rig-veda III, 47, 2, 'United with the
host of Maruts, O Indra, drink the Soma, O wise hero!' &c.) having
meanwhile been pronounced by the Hot*ri*, the Adhvaryu makes libations
from the first cup at the Vasha*t* and Anuvasha*t*. Then pouring the
remains of the juice into some other vessel, to be taken to the Sadas,
he enters the Havirdhâna and draws the third Marutvatîya graha with the
cup just emptied. Having deposited it, he betakes himself to. the Sadas
to drink with the Hot*ri* the remains of the first libation. Thereupon
the Hot*ri* recites the Marutvatîya *S*astra.

The Marutvatîya Sastra consists of the following parts. After the
summons (âhâva) to the Adhvaryu, and the response (pratigara) of the
latter, the Hot*ri* intones the

Pratipad (opening triplet), Rig-veda VIII, 57, 1-3, followed by the
Anu*k*ara (sequel), VIII, 2, 1-3.

Then the Indranihava pragâtha (VIII, 53, 5) and the Brâhma*n*aspatya
pragâtha (I, 40, 5).

Then follow the three Dhâyyâs (complementary verses), III, 20, 4; I, 91,
2; I, 64, 6; and the Marutvatîya pragâtha, VIII, 89, 3, succeeded by the
hymn X, 73, the chief part of the *S*astra, in the middle of which
(after the sixth verse), the Nivid ('Let us sing, Om! may Indra with the
Maruts drink of the Soma,' &c.) is inserted.

Having recited the last verse (paridhânîyâ or closing verse) of the
hymn, he concludes the *S*astra by the Ukthavîrya, 'Praise has been sung
to Indra who hears thee!' Thereupon the offering prayer III, 47, 4 is
pronounced, and libations are made, both at the Vasha*t* and
Anuvasha*t*, by the Adhvaryu from the third, and after him each time, by
the Pratiprasthât*ri* from the second graha.

The priests having drank in the Sadas the Soma remaining from the grahas
and in the *k*amasas, the Mâhendra cup is drawn.

<span id="fn_799"></span>[338:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_802.md) That is, as a
chief, or lord, might do so with a clansman (vai*s*yena, Kâ*n*va text);
or as the master of a house with his servants.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[339:1](sbe2652.htm#fr_803.md) Or, according to
Ludwig, 'rendered favourable by the performers (priests).'

<span id="fn_801"></span>[339:2](sbe2652.htm#fr_804.md) That is, the
(first) P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra, consisting of the Rathantara-sâm an, Sâmav.
II, 30-31. For the way in which the two verses are manipulated (by
repetition of the last pâda of the first, and of the second pâda of the
second verse), so as to yield a three-versed choral, see Haug, Ait. Br.
II, p. 198; Weber, Ind. Stud. VIII, p. 25. These chants derive their
name from the circumstance that the Sâmans employed in them are capable
of being used as 'p*ri*sh*th*as,' that is, of being chanted twice with
another Sâman inserted between them,--or, to speak symbolically, to
serve as the womb for the reception of an embryo. For this purpose the
Rathantara and B*ri*hat Sâmans are chiefly used. See note on [IV, 5, 4,
13](sbe2663.htm#4:5:4:13.md). Whenever the P*ri*sh*th*as are chanted in
this way (which they are not at the ordinary Agnish*t*oma), it is
chiefly at this very place in the Soma performance, at the midday
libation. The chant is succeeded by the recitation, by the Hot*ri*, of
the Nishkevalya *S*astra, consisting of the following parts. The Âhâva
(and pratigara) is followed by the Stotriya (Rig-veda VII, 32, 22-23,
identical with the Rathantara) and Anurûpa (VIII, 3, 7-8) pragâthas;
then a dhâyyâ, X, 74,.6; the Sâma-pragâtha, VIII, 3, 1, and the hymn (to
Indra) I, 32, with the Nivid inserted in the middle (after the eighth
verse). Finally the Hot*ri* pronounces the Ukthavîrya, and the offering
prayer, VII, 22, 1, after which the Mâhendra libation is poured into the
fire.

Then follows the distribution of the Ukthya graha among the three
assistants of the Hot*ri* and the recitation of their (nishkevalya)
*s*astras--each preceded by a P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra \[Sâmav. II, 32-34
(chanted to the Vâmadevya-sâman); 35-36 (Naudhasa); 37-38 (Kâleya)
respectively\]--as at the conclusion of the morning performance; see [p.
295](sbe2647.htm#page_295), note [2](sbe2647.htm#fn_711.md). Thereupon he
addresses the above summons to the respective priests, for the
preparations necessary for the evening pressing.
