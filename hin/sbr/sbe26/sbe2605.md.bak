### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:1">3:1:3:1</span></span>1. Having
brought water forward <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md), he takes out
(the material for) a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vish*n*u; for
Agni is all the deities, since it is in Agni that offering is made to
all the deities. Moreover Agni is the lower half, and Vish*n*u is the
upper half of the sacrifice: 'I will become consecrated after
encompassing all the deities, after encompassing the entire sacrifice,'
thus he thinks, and hence there is a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni
and Vish*n*u.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:2">3:1:3:2</span></span>2. Some
then offer a rice-pap to the Âdityas. This is referred to (in the
passage, Rig-veda X, 72, 8), 'There are eight sons of Aditi who were
born from her body; with seven she went to the gods, but
Mârtâ*nd*a <span id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_44.md) she cast off.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:3">3:1:3:3</span></span>3. Now
Aditi had eight sons. But those that are called 'the gods, sons of
Aditi,' were only seven, for the eighth, Mârtâ*nd*a, she brought forth
unformed <span id="fr_45"></span>[3](#fn_45.md): it was a mere lump of
bodily matter <span id="fr_46"></span>[4](#fn_46.md), as broad as it was
high. Some, however, say that he was of the size of a man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:4">3:1:3:4</span></span>4. The
gods, sons of Aditi, then spake, 'That

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

which was born after us <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md) must not be
lost: come, let us fashion it.' They accordingly fashioned it as this
man is fashioned. The flesh which was cut off him, and thrown down in a
lump, became the elephant: hence they say that one must not accept an
elephant (as a gift) <span id="fr_48"></span>[2](#fn_48.md), since the
elephant has sprung from man. Now he whom they thus fashioned was
Vivasvat, the Âditya (or the sun); and of him (came) these creatures.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:5">3:1:3:5</span></span>5. He
spake, 'Among my offspring he shall be successful who shall offer that
rice-pap to the Âdityas.' Accordingly he alone succeeds who offers that
rice-pap to the Âdityas. Only that (cake) to Agni and Vish*n*u is,
however, generally approved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:6">3:1:3:6</span></span>6. There
are seventeen kindling-verses for it <span
id="fr_49"></span>[3](#fn_49.md). In a low voice he offers to the two
deities. There are five fore-offerings and three after-offerings. For
the sake of completeness they perform the patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as <span
id="fr_50"></span>[4](#fn_50.md); but he offers no samish*t*aya*g*us, lest,
having put on that garment of the consecrated, he should reach the end
of the sacrifice before its completion; for the samish*t*aya*g*us is the
end of the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:7">3:1:3:7</span></span>7. He
(the sacrificer) then gets himself anointed (with fresh butter), while
standing east of the hall. For, having been flayed, man is sore; and by
getting himself anointed, he becomes healed of his soreness: for man's
skin is on the cow, and that fresh butter

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

also comes from the cow. He (the Adhvaryu) thus supplies him with his
own skin, and for this reason he gets himself anointed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:8">3:1:3:8</span></span>8. It is
fresh butter,--for melted butter (ghee) belongs to the gods, and creamy
butter <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md) to men. Here, on the other
hand, it is neither ghee nor creamy butter; it should rather be both
ghee and creamy butter, for the sake of unimpaired vigour: by means of
that which is of unimpaired vigour he accordingly makes him of
unimpaired vigour.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:9">3:1:3:9</span></span>9. He
anoints him from the head down to the feet in accordance with the
tendency of the hair, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. IV, 3), 'Thou art the sap
of the great ones.' The 'great ones,' doubtless, is one of the names of
those cows, and their sap indeed it is: therefore he says, 'thou art the
sap of the great ones.' 'Thou art life-giving: give me light!' There is
nothing obscure in this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:10">3:1:3:10</span></span>10.
Thereupon he anoints the eyes. 'Sore, indeed, is the eye of man; mine is
sound,' so spake Yâ*gñ*avalkya. Dim-eyed, indeed, he was (heretofore);
and the secretion of his eyes was matter. He now makes his eyes sound by
anointing them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:11">3:1:3:11</span></span>11.
Now, when the gods slew the Asura-Rakshas, *S*ush*n*a <span
id="fr_52"></span>[2](#fn_52.md), the Dânava, falling backward entered into
the eyes of men: he is that pupil of the eye, and

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

looks like a young lad <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md). Against him
he (the sacrificer), now that he enters on the sacrifice, raises a
rampart of stone all round himself, for the ointment is (produced from)
stone.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:12">3:1:3:12</span></span>12. It
is such as comes from mount Trikakud; for when Indra slew V*ri*tra he
transformed that eye of his (V*ri*tra's) into the mount Trikakud <span
id="fr_54"></span>[2](#fn_54). The reason, then, why (ointment.md) from
mount Trikakud (is used), is that he thereby puts eye into eye. Should
he be unable to obtain any Traikakuda ointment, any other than
Traikakuda may be used; for one and the same, indeed, is the
significance of the ointment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:13">3:1:3:13</span></span>13. He
anoints (the eyes) with a reed-stalk, for the reed is a thunderbolt. It
is one with a tuft, in order to chase away the evil spirits <span
id="fr_55"></span>[3](#fn_55.md). For rootless,

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

indeed, and unfettered on both sides, the Rakshas roams along the air;
even as man here roams along the air <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md), rootless and unfettered on both sides:
the reason, then, why it is (a reed-stalk) with a tuft, is to chase away
the evil spirits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:14">3:1:3:14</span></span>14. The
right eye he anoints first; for in human practice the left (eye is
anointed) first, but with the gods (it is done) thus.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:15">3:1:3:15</span></span>15. He
anoints it with the text, 'Thou art the eye-ball of V*ri*tra,'--for
V*ri*tra's eye-ball it indeed is;--'Eye-giving thou art: give me the
eye!' in this there is nothing obscure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:16">3:1:3:16</span></span>16. The
right eye he anoints once with the sacrificial formula, once silently;
and the left one he anoints once with the formula, twice silently: thus
he makes the left (or upper) one superior <span
id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_57.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:17">3:1:3:17</span></span>17. And
the reason why he anoints five times, is that the sacrifice is of equal
measure with the year, and five seasons there are in the year: he thus
obtains possession of the latter in five (divisions), and therefore he
anoints five times.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:18">3:1:3:18</span></span>18. He
then purifies him with a cleanser (pavitra, strainer) of sacred grass;
for impure, indeed, is man:--he is foul within in that he speaks
untruth;--and sacred grass is pure: 'Having become pure, I shall be
consecrated,' thus he thinks;--and the stalks of sacred grass are a
means of cleansing,--

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Having become
cleansed, I shall be consecrated,' thus he thinks; and therefore he
purifies him with a cleanser of sacred grass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:19">3:1:3:19</span></span>19. It
may consist of one (stalk of grass); for that blower (or purifier, the
Wind) is one only, and in accordance with his nature is this (cleanser):
hence it may consist of one (stalk).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:20">3:1:3:20</span></span>20. Or
there may be three (stalks); for one, indeed, is that blower, but on
entering into man he becomes threefold, to wit, the out-breathing, the
in-breathing, and the through-breathing <span
id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md), and in accordance with his measure is
this (cleanser): hence there may be three (stalks).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:21">3:1:3:21</span></span>21. Or
there may be seven (stalks <span id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_59).md); for
there are seven vital airs of the head: hence there may be seven
(stalks). There may even be thrice seven,--one and twenty: such indeed
is perfection.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:22">3:1:3:22</span></span>22. He
purifies him with seven (stalks) each time, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. IV,
4), 'May the Lord of thought purify me!' The lord of thought doubtless
is Pra*g*âpati <span id="fr_60"></span>[3](#fn_60.md): he thereby means to
say, 'May Pra*g*âpati purify me!' 'May the lord of speech purify me!'
The lord of speech doubtless is Pra*g*âpati <span
id="fr_61"></span>[4](#fn_61.md): he thereby means to say, 'May Pra*g*âpati
purify me!' 'May the divine Savit*ri* purify me,'--for well purified
indeed is he whom the divine

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Savit*ri* has
purified <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md); therefore he says, 'May
the divine Savit*ri* purify me!'--'with a flawless cleanser;' for that
blower (the wind) is indeed a flawless cleanser: 'with that one,' he
means to say; 'with the rays of the sun;' for they, the rays of the sun,
are indeed purifiers; therefore he says, 'with the rays of the sun.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:23">3:1:3:23</span></span>23. 'O
Lord of the pavitra' (means of purification),--for he (who is
consecrated) is indeed the lord of the pavitra,--'of thee, purified by
the pavitra,--for he is indeed purified by the pavitra';--'with
whatsoever desire I purify myself, may I be able to effect it!' whereby
he says, 'May I reach the end of the sacrifice!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:24">3:1:3:24</span></span>24. He
then makes him pronounce the beginning of the benedictions (Vâ*g*. S.
IV, 5), 'We approach you, O gods, for desirable goods, at the opening of
the sacrifice; we call on you, O gods, for holy <span
id="fr_63"></span>[2](#fn_63.md) blessings.' Thereby the officiating
priests invoke on him those blessings which are their own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:25">3:1:3:25</span></span>25. He
(the sacrificer) then bends his fingers inwards, viz. the two (little
fingers), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. IV, 6), 'Hail, from the mind (I take
hold of) the sacrifice!'--the two (nameless or ring fingers) with,
'Hail, from the wide ether!'--the two (middle fingers) with, 'Hail, from
the sky and earth!'--with, 'Hail, from the wind, I take hold (of the
sacrifice)!' he clenches both fists <span id="fr_64"></span>[3](#fn_64.md).
Not visibly

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

indeed is the sacrifice to be taken hold of, as is either this staff or
the garment,--but invisible indeed are the gods, invisible is the
sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:26">3:1:3:26</span></span>26. Now
when he says, 'Hail, from the mind (I take hold of) the sacrifice,' he
takes hold of it from the mind;--in saying, 'From the wide ether,' he
takes hold of it from the ether;--in saying, 'From heaven and earth,' he
takes hold of it from those two, heaven and earth, on which this entire
universe rests;--and in saying, 'From the wind I take hold of (the
sacrifice)'--the wind being the sacrifice--he takes hold of the
sacrifice directly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:27">3:1:3:27</span></span>27. And
when he calls, 'Hail! Hail <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md)!'--the
'Svâhâ' being the sacrifice--he thereby appropriates the sacrifice. Here
now he restrains his speech; the sacrifice being speech: he thereby
appropriates <span id="fr_66"></span>[2](#fn_66.md) the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:1:3:28">3:1:3:28</span></span>28. He
(the Adhvaryu) then makes him enter the hall. He walks along the back of
the Âhavanîya and the front of the Gârhapatya <span
id="fr_67"></span>[3](#fn_67.md),--this is his passage until the Soma
pressing. The reason why this is his passage until the Soma pressing is
this. The fire is the womb of the sacrifice, and the consecrated is an
embryo; and the embryo moves about

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

within the womb. And since he (the sacrificer) moves about there
(between the fires), and now turns round and now back, therefore these
embryos move about, and now turn round and now back. Hence this is his
passage till the Soma pressing.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_43"></span>[12:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_43.md) Viz. the so-called
'pra*n*îtâ*h*,' see part i, p. 9 note. The offering, described in the
following paragraphs, is called the Dîksha*n*î-yesh*t*i, 'Consecration
offering.' As to the formulas used at the offering, see Ait. Br. I, 4
seq.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[12:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_44.md) The bird, Vish*n*u,
the sun.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[12:3](sbe2605.htm#fr_45.md) Or, the eighth she
brought forth undeveloped, as a mârtâ*nd*a (? either a bird, or, more
probably, in accordance with Taitt. S. VI, 5, 6, 1, = vy*ri*ddham
â*nd*am, 'an abortive egg'). See Rig-veda Sanhitâ, translated by M. M.,
p. 239.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[12:4](sbe2605.htm#fr_46.md) Sandegha; the St.
Petersburg Dict. takes it in the sense of 'doubt, uncertainty,' in this
passage.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[13:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_47.md) Or, perhaps, after the
manner of us (anu).

<span id="fn_48"></span>[13:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_48.md) Muir, O. S. T. IV, 15,
reads 'parig*ri*h*n*îyât' instead of 'pratig*ri*h*n*îyât,' and
translates, 'let no one catch an elephant, for an elephant partakes of
the nature of man.'

<span id="fn_49"></span>[13:3](sbe2605.htm#fr_49.md) For the ordinary
eleven Sâmidhenîs (raised to the number of fifteen by repetitions of the
first and last verses), see part i, p. 102, and for the two additional
ones (dhâyyâ), ib. p. 112 note.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[13:4](sbe2605.htm#fr_50.md) See part i, p. 256;
for the Samish*t*aya*g*us, ib. p. 262.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[14:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_51.md) Phâ*nt*a, explained as
the first particles of butter that appear in churning (?). The Kâ*n*va
recension, on the other hand, reads 'â*g*ya*m* nishpâ*nt*am' (!)
instead. Cf. Taitt. S. VI, 1, 1, 4, Gh*ri*ta*m* devânâm, mastu
pit*rin*â*m*, nishpakvam (i.e. surabhi gh*ri*tam, 'well-seasoned
butter,' Sây.) manushyâ*n*âm; tad vai etat sarvadevatya*m* yan
navanîtam; also Ait. Br. I, 3, â*g*ya*m* vai devânâ*m*, surabhi
gh*ri*tam manushyâ*n*âm, âyutam pit*rin*â*m*, navanîta*m* garbhâ*n*âm;
with Haug's note, Transl. p. 8.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[14:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_52.md) The Kâ*n*va text (MSS.
O. W.) reads *S*i*s*na.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[15:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_53.md) Sa esha kanînaka*h*
kumâraka iva paribhâsate. A play on the word kanînaka, which has the
double meaning of 'youth' and 'pupil of the eye.' The St. Petersburg
Dict. assigns also to kumâraka the meaning of 'ball of the eye' in this
(the only) passage. The Kâ*n*va recension reads, Sa esha kumâraka iva
kanînakâyâm (? both 'maiden' and 'pupil of the eye').

<span id="fn_54"></span>[15:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_54.md) 'Indra slew V*ri*tra,
his eye-ball fell away, it became collyrium.' Taitt. S. VI, 1, 1, 5.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[15:3](sbe2605.htm#fr_55.md) Professor Delbrück, S.
F. III, 27, takes it thus, 'He brushes the eye with the end of a reed,
for the reed is a thunderbolt capable of repelling mischief.' But, if
'virakshastâyai' belonged to what precedes, it would probably have to be
construed with '*s*areshikayâ ’nakti,' the clause with 'vai,' giving the
reason, being inserted parenthetically; while, in an idiomatic
rendering, it would have to be placed at the end: He anoints the eyes
with a reed-stalk in order to chase away the evil spirits, the reed
being a thunderbolt. This abstract dative of purpose is very common; it
being generally construed with what precedes, as, for instance, I, 1, 4,
1; 3, 2, 8; 5, 3, 8; 15; [III, 1, 2, 13](sbe2604.htm#3:1:2:13.md);
[19](sbe2604.htm#3:1:2:19.md); ; and, with a parenthetic clause with 'vai'
intervening, [III, 2, 1, 13](sbe2607.htm#3:2:1:13.md); [IV, 5, 7,
7](sbe2666.htm#4:5:7:7.md). Not less common is the analogous construction
with a clause with 'ned' <span id="page_16">p. 16</span> ('lest such an
event should happen') instead of the dative of the abstract, cf. I, 2,
1, 8; 9; [IV, 5, 9, 3](sbe2668.htm#4:5:9:3.md).

<span id="fn_56"></span>[16:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_56.md) I now take this
passage differently from my interpretation of I, 1, 2, 4 ('and, in order
that this man may move about the air, rootless and unfettered in both
directions'). See also [IV, 1, 1, 20](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:20.md).

<span id="fn_57"></span>[16:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_57.md) 'Tad uttaram evaitad
uttarâvat karoti;' 'uttarấm évaitad úttaram karoti,' Kâ*n*va recension.
Cf. [p. 2](sbe2603.htm#page_2), note [1](sbe2603.htm#fn_24.md).

<span id="fn_58"></span>[17:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_58.md) See part i, p. 19,
note 2.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[17:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_59.md) The Taitt. S. VI, 1, 1
allows the option between (one), 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 21 stalks; while
the Ait. Br. I, 3 mentions only the highest number.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[17:3](sbe2605.htm#fr_60.md) The Kâ*n*va text adds,
sa hi *k*ittânâm îsh*t*e, 'for he rules over the thoughts.'

<span id="fn_61"></span>[17:4](sbe2605.htm#fr_61.md) The Kâ*n*vas read,
aya*m* vâva vâkpatir yo ’yam pavate, tad enam esha punâti, 'the lord of
speech doubtless is that blower (purifier, the wind): hence it is he
that purifies him.'

<span id="fn_62"></span>[18:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_62.md) See [p.
8](sbe2604.htm#page_8), note [3](sbe2604.htm#fn_34.md).

<span id="fn_63"></span>[18:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_63.md) I take ya*gñ*iyâsa*h*
as acc. pl. fem., as does Mahîdh. Perhaps it ought to be translated 'for
prayers proper at the sacrifice,' whereby he makes sure that each priest
uses his own proper prayers during the sacrifice.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[18:3](sbe2605.htm#fr_64.md) For the symbolic
meaning of the closing of the hands, see [III, 2, 1,
6](sbe2607.htm#3:2:1:6.md); Ait. Br. I, 3, 20.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[19:1](sbe2605.htm#fr_65.md) That is, 'svâhâ' in
each formula. The Sa*m*hitâ has twice 'svâhâ' in the last formula (svâhâ
vâtâd ârabhe svâhâ), to which this might refer, but neither recension of
the Brâhma*n*a mentions the final 'svâhâ.'

<span id="fn_66"></span>[19:2](sbe2605.htm#fr_66.md) Literally, 'he takes
within him' (as the speech confined within him through silence).

<span id="fn_67"></span>[19:3](sbe2605.htm#fr_67.md) That is, he enters the
hall by the front (east) door, then walks along the north side of the
Âhavanîya and altar, and passes between the Gârhapatya and altar to his
seat south of the Âhavanîya. The Pratiprasthât*ri* then silently anoints
and purifies the Dîkshita's wife and leads her into the hall, either by
the front or back door.
