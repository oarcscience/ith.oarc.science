#### CONSTRUCTION OF SHEDS, AND PREPARATION OF PRESSING-PLACE AND HEARTHS (DHISH*N*YAS).

### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:1">3:5:3:1</span></span>1. The
sacrifice is a man; it is a man for the reason that a man spreads
(prepares) it. In being spread it is made just as large <span
id="fr_341"></span>[2](#fn_339.md) as a man: this is why the sacrifice is a
man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:2">3:5:3:2</span></span>2. The
Soma-cart (shed) is no other than his head, and has Vish*n*u for its
deity <span id="fr_342"></span>[3](#fn_340.md). And because Soma is
therein--Soma being havis (material for offering) for the
gods--therefore it is called Havirdhâna (receptacle of havis).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:3">3:5:3:3</span></span>3. The
Âhavanîya is no other than his mouth: hence, when he offers on the
Âhavanîya, it is as if he poured (food) into the mouth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:4">3:5:3:4</span></span>4. The
sacrificial stake is no other than his crest-lock; and the Âgnîdhrîya
and Mâr*g*âlîya <span id="fr_343"></span>[4](#fn_341.md) are his arms.

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:5">3:5:3:5</span></span>5. The
Sadas <span id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_342) (tent for the priests.md) is no
other than his belly: wherefore they feed in the Sadas, for whatever
food is eaten here on earth all that settles down here in the belly. And
because all the gods sat (sad) in it therefore it is called Sadas: and
so do these Brahmans of every family now sit therein.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:6">3:5:3:6</span></span>6. And
the two fires which are behind <span id="fr_345"></span>[2](#fn_343.md) it
are his feet. In being spread it is made just as large as a man: this is
why the sacrifice is a man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:7">3:5:3:7</span></span>7. The
cart-shed has doors on both sides; and so has the Sadas doors on both
sides: hence this man is perforated from one end to the other. He steps
to the Soma-carts when they have been -washed down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:8">3:5:3:8</span></span>8. They
turn them round, the southern one on the south side, and the northern
one on the north side <span id="fr_346"></span>[3](#fn_344.md). The larger
of the two should be the southern (or right) one <span
id="fr_347"></span>[4](#fn_345.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:9">3:5:3:9</span></span>9. Over
them, having been turned round (and placed on the altar), they put a mat
of reed-grass; or, if he cannot procure a reed-mat, a frame of split
cane

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

made in like manner as a reed-mat. They fasten a front-band (to the
posts of the front door <span id="fr_348"></span>[1](#fn_346).md). They
enclose (the carts) within two upright hurdles; and lay a (second)
reed-mat, or a frame of split cane made in like manner as a reed-mat,
behind (the first mat <span id="fr_349"></span>[2](#fn_347).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:10">3:5:3:10</span></span>10.
Now <span id="fr_350"></span>[3](#fn_348.md), having again entered (the
hall), and

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

taken ghee in four ladlings, he makes offering to Savit*ri* for his
impulsion, for Savit*ri* is the impeller (prasavit*ri*) of the gods: 'We
will perform the sacrifice, for one impelled by Savit*ri*,' thus (the
priest thinks and) therefore he makes offering to Savit*ri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:11">3:5:3:11</span></span>11. He
offers with the text (Vâ*g*. S. V, 14; Rig-veda V, 81, 1), 'They harness
the mind and they harness the thoughts'--with the mind and with speech
they truly perform the sacrifice. When he says, 'They harness the mind,'
he harnesses the mind; and when he says, 'and they harness the thoughts
(dhî),' he harnesses speech; for it is thereby <span
id="fr_351"></span>[1](#fn_349.md) that people seek to make their living in
accordance with their respective intelligence (dhî), either by reciting
(the Veda), or by readiness of speech, or by songs,--with these two thus
harnessed they perform the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:12">3:5:3:12</span></span>12.
'The priests of the priest, of the great inspirer of devotion,'--the
learned Brâhmans versed in sacred writ, truly, are the priests: it is
regarding them that he says this. And 'of the great inspirer of
devotion <span id="fr_352"></span>[2](#fn_350.md),'--the great inspirer of
devotion, truly, is the sacrifice: it is regarding the sacrifice that he
says this. 'The knower of rites alone hath assigned the priestly
offices,' for, in performing

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

the sacrifice, they indeed assign the priestly offices. 'Great is the
praise of the divine Savit*ri*; Hail!' Thus he offers to Savit*ri* for
his impulsion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:13">3:5:3:13</span></span>13.
Having then taken ghee a second time in four ladlings, he walks out (of
the hall by the front door). The (sacrificer's) wife is led out by the
south door. He then lays down a piece of gold in the right wheel-track
of the southern Sonia-cart, and offers thereon, with (Vâ*g*. S. V, 15;
Rig-veda I, 22, 17), 'Vish*n*u strode through this(universe),thrice he
put down his foot: it is enveloped in his dust; Hail!' The residue (of
ghee) he pours into the wife's hand. She anoints the burning (part) of
the axle <span id="fr_353"></span>[1](#fn_351) with (Vâ*g*. S. V, 17.md),
'Audible to the gods, announce ye unto the gods!' He hands to his
assistant both the offering-spoon and the melting-pot. They lead the
wife round by the back of the two fires <span
id="fr_354"></span>[2](#fn_352.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:14">3:5:3:14</span></span>14.
Having taken ghee in four ladlings, the assistant lays down a piece of
gold in the right wheel-track of the northern Soma-cart, and offers
thereon, with (Vâ*g*. S. V, 16; Rig-veda VII, 99, 3), 'Be ye too
abundant in food and milch kine and pastures, through benevolence to
man! Thou proppedst asunder these two worlds, O Vish*n*u; with beams of
light didst thou hold fast <span id="fr_355"></span>[3](#fn_353.md) the
earth on all sides; Hail!' The residue (of ghee) he pours into the
wife's hand. She anoints the burning (part) of the axle with,

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Audible to the
gods, announce ye unto the gods!' Then as to why he thus offers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:15">3:5:3:15</span></span>15.
Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid
of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas; and, the ghee being a
thunderbolt, they kept off the evil spirits from the south by that
thunderbolt, the ghee; and thus they came not after them on their way.
And in like manner does he now keep off the evil spirits from the south
by that thunderbolt, the ghee; and thus they do not come after him on
his way. And the reason why he offers with two verses relating to
Vish*n*u, is that the Soma-cart belongs to Vish*n*u.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:16">3:5:3:16</span></span>16. And
in that the wife anoints the burning (part) of the axle, thereby a
productive union is effected; for when woman and man become heated, the
seed flows, and thereupon birth takes place. She anoints in a direction
away (from the cart), for away the seed is cast. He then says (to the
Hot*ri*), 'Recite to the Soma-carts as they are wheeled forward <span
id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_354.md)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:17">3:5:3:17</span></span>17. He
makes (the sacrificer) say, 'Go ye both forward, furthering the cult!'
The cult, namely, is the sacrifice: 'go ye both forward, furthering the
sacrifice' he thereby means to say. 'Convey ye the sacrifice upward;
lead it not astray <span id="fr_357"></span>[2](#fn_355.md)!' whereby he
means to say, 'convey this sacrifice upward to the world of the gods;'
and by saying 'lead it not astray,' he prays for this (sacrificer) that
he may not

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

stumble. Let them wheel (the carts) forward, as it were lifting them, so
that they may not creak; for of the Asuras is that voice which is in the
axle <span id="fr_358"></span>[1](#fn_356.md): 'Lest the Asuras’ voice
should speak here!' so he thinks. But if they should creak,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:18">3:5:3:18</span></span>18. Let
him make (the sacrificer) say this, 'Speak ye unto your own cow-pen, ye
divine resorts; speak not my life away, speak not my offspring away!'
This, then, is the expiation thereof.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:19">3:5:3:19</span></span>19. As
to this they say, 'Let him stride three steps from the high altar
westward and make the Soma-carts stop there: this is the measure for the
Soma-carts.' But there is no (fixed) measure in this; wherever he
himself may think fit in his mind, only not too near <span
id="fr_359"></span>[2](#fn_357), nor too far (from the high altar.md),
there let him stop them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:20">3:5:3:20</span></span>20. He
salutes them with, 'May ye rejoice here on the height of the earth!' for
this (altar) is verily the height <span id="fr_360"></span>[3](#fn_358.md)
(top) of the earth, since his offering-fire is in the heaven. He makes
them rest on their naves <span id="fr_361"></span>[4](#fn_359.md) for that
is the appearance of repose.

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:21">3:5:3:21</span></span>21. The
Adhvaryu, having gone round along the north side (of the carts), props
the southern cart, with (Vâ*g*. S. V, 18; Rig-veda I, 154, 1), 'Now will
I declare the heroic deeds of Vish*n*u, who measured out the earthly
regions; who propped the upper seat, striding thrice, the wide-stepping!
For Vish*n*u (I prop) thee!' He fixes the prop in a different place from
where (it is fixed) in ordinary practice <span
id="fr_362"></span>[1](#fn_360.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:22">3:5:3:22</span></span>22. The
assistant then props the northern cart, with (Vâ*g*. S. V, 19), 'Either
from the heaven, O Vish*n*u, or from the earth, or from the great, wide
airy region, O Vish*n*u, fill both thine hands with wealth and bestow on
us from the right and the left! For Vish*n*u thee!' He fixes the prop in
a different place from where (it is fixed) in ordinary practice. The
reason why he performs with prayers to Vish*n*u is that the Soma-cart
belongs to Vish*n*u.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:23">3:5:3:23</span></span>23. He
then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching the middle
reed-mat <span id="fr_363"></span>[2](#fn_361.md) (Vâ*g*. S. V, 20;
Rig-veda I, 154, 2), 'Let Vish*n*u then be praised for his power,
terrible like a wild beast prowling about the mountains, on whose three
wide strides all beings abide!' Now that (mat-covering) indeed is his
(Vish*n*u, the shed's) upper skull-bone <span
id="fr_364"></span>[3](#fn_362.md)

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

for thereon, as it were, the other skull-bones rest: this is why he says
'they abide on.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:24">3:5:3:24</span></span>24.
Thereupon he makes him say, after touching the front-band (Vâ*g*. S. V,
2), 'Thou art Vish*n*u's fillet;' for it indeed is his fillet. He then
makes him say, after touching the two upright hurdles, 'Ye are the
corners of Vish*n*u's mouth;' for they indeed are the corners of his
mouth. Then that mat which is behind there, that indeed is that
skull-bone of his here behind (viz. the occiput).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:3:25">3:5:3:25</span></span>25.
With 'Thou art Vish*n*u's sewer <span id="fr_365"></span>[1](#fn_363.md),'
he sews (the hurdles to the four door posts) with cord by means of a
wooden pin. With, 'Thou art Vish*n*u's fixed (point) <span
id="fr_366"></span>[2](#fn_364.md),' he then makes a knot, 'lest it should
fall asunder.' That same (knot) he undoes when the work is completed;
and thus disease <span id="fr_367"></span>[3](#fn_365.md) befalls not
either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer. The completed (cart-shed) he
touches with, 'Thou art Vish*n*u's own,' for the Soma-cart (and shed)
belongs to Vish*n*u.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_339"></span>[126:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_341.md) Yâvat-tâvat would
rather seem to mean here 'of corresponding (or relatively the same)
proportions' as a man, viz. as the respective sacrificer. 'Sa vai
tâyamâno yâvân eva purushas tâvân vidhîyate, purushasyaiva vidhâm anu.'
Kâ*n*va rec.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[126:3](sbe2621.htm#fr_342.md) Soma himself is
Vish*n*u.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[126:4](sbe2621.htm#fr_343.md) See [III, 6, 1,
23](sbe2623.htm#3:6:1:23); [2, 21](sbe2624.htm#3:6:2:21.md).

<span id="fn_342"></span>[127:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_344.md) See [III, 6, 2,
21](sbe2624.htm#3:6:2:21.md).

<span id="fn_343"></span>[127:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_345) That is, the (old.md)
Âhavanîya and Gârhapatya fires of the Prâ*k*îna-va*ms*a.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[127:3](sbe2621.htm#fr_346.md) The southern (and
larger) cart is under the charge of the Adhvaryu and the northern one
under that of his assistant, the Pratiprasthât*ri*. Each now drives his
cart westward along the south and north sides respectively; and when
they are opposite the hall (*s*âla), they make the carts turn round from
left to right; whereupon they drive back to the altar, and place them
thereon with the shafts towards the east, near the anta*h*pâta
('intermediate' peg, see [III, 5, 1, 1](sbe2619.htm#3:5:1:1).md), south and
north of the 'spine' (cf. [p. 112](sbe2619.htm#page_112.md), note
[2](sbe2619.htm#fn_294).md), each at the distance of one cubit from the
latter.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[127:4](sbe2621.htm#fr_347.md) In order to make
the shed incline towards the north, cf. [III, 1, 1,
2](sbe2603.htm#3:1:1:2.md).

<span id="fn_346"></span>[128:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_348.md) It is not clear to
me whether the arrangements mentioned in this paragraph refer to the
carts in the first place, and have then to be repeated after the shed
has been erected, or whether, as I think, some of them refer to the shed
only. Even at the time of the Kâty. Sûtras there seems to have been some
confusion in this respect, and the rules VIII, 4, 7-12 (10-15, in
edition) were entirely misunderstood by the commentator. It is, however,
certain that the carts were covered with mats, previously to being
shifted from the back to the front part of the altar. As regards the
shed, it seems to have been constructed in the following way. In front
of the carts, as well as behind them, beams are driven into the ground,
six on each side, according to Sâya*n*a on T. S. I, 2, 13; the two
middle ones, one cubit north and south of the 'spine' respectively,
forming a gateway on each side (Kâty. VIII, 4, 24 scholl.). On these two
rows of beams other beams are laid, running from south to north, and
forming, as it were, the lintels of the gates; and thereon the tie-beams
rest (west to east). This frame of timber is to form a square of nine
(or ten) cubits. Over the tie-beams three mats of
reed-grass(*k*adis)--measuring nine (or ten) cubits by three (3½)--are
spread, from south to north; first the middle one and then the two
others, behind and in front of it. Upright hurdles (or reed-mats) are
then stretched between the respective corner-posts, so as to form the
south and north sides of the shed; and are 'sewn' to the corner-posts.
Between the tops of the two front door-posts a band or garland of
plaited reed-tufts (or, according to Haug, a bunch of Darbha grass,
consisting of dry and green stalks) is hung up, to represent either a
fillet or wreath worn on the forehead (?), or as a door-garland.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[128:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_349.md) This remark would
seem to imply that there are only two mats (cf. parags.
[23](sbe2621.htm#3:5:3:23), [24](sbe2621.htm#3:5:3:24).md), but perhaps it
is merely intended to show that two mats are spread behind and in front
of the first mat (i.e. from south to north, and not west to east); not
that there are only two mats.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[128:3](sbe2621.htm#fr_350.md) If the preceding
paragraph refers (at least partly) to the shed, <span id="page_129">p.
129</span> then the atha here means 'Now, in the first place,' thereby
introducing details preliminary to what has just been stated.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[129:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_351.md) See [III, 2, 4,
16](sbe2610.htm#3:2:4:16.md). I now refer 'etayâ' to 'vâ*k*am,' as does
Sâya*n*a,--yadâ buddhir *g*âyate tadâ khalv etayâ vâ*k*â
*g*u*g*yûshanti. He explains 'prakâmodya' by 'mlai*kkh*ika*m* laukikam
bhâsha*n*am,' barbarous, worldly speech.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[129:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_352.md) Vipa*sk*it,
probably 'thinker of hymns.' It remains doubtful what meaning our author
assigned to the word. Mahîdhara explains it by sarva*gñ*a,
'all-knowing.' Sâya*n*a, on Taitt. S. I, 2, 13, refers 'viprasya
b*ri*hato vipa*sk*itah' to the sacrificer.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[130:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_353.md) That is, the iron
pins driven into the axle, round which the naves of the wheels revolve.
See also [p. 121](sbe2620.htm#page_121), note [2](sbe2620.htm#fn_322.md).

<span id="fn_352"></span>[130:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_354.md) They make her enter
the hall by the south door and walk round by the back of the (old)
Gârhapatya fire-place to the wheel-tracks on the north side where the
Pratiprasthât*ri* is about to offer.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[130:3](sbe2621.htm#fr_355.md) The rays of the sun
are apparently likened to ropes wherewith he keeps the earth straight
and firm.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[131:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_356.md) While reciting his
hymn of eight verses (brought up, as usual, to twelve by repetitions of
the first and last verses) the Hot*ri* has to follow the carts so as to
have the north wheel-track of the south cart between his feet. Cf. [p.
79](sbe2614.htm#page_79), note [1](sbe2614.htm#fn_208.md). For the verses
recited by him, see Ait. Br. I, 29; Â*s*v. *S*r. IV, 9.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[131:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_357.md) Or, 'falter not!'

<span id="fn_356"></span>[132:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_358.md) The Taitt. S. VI,
2, 9 refers it to Varu*n*a, on account of the axle being bound firmly
with strings (thongs), resembling Varu*n*a's noose.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[132:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_359.md) Rather, 'not so
very near,' 'nicht allzu nahe, nicht gar zu nahe.'

<span id="fn_358"></span>[132:3](sbe2621.htm#fr_360.md) Both here, and on
Taitt. S. I, 2, 13, Sâya*n*a takes 'varshman' in the sense of body
(*s*arîra).'

<span id="fn_359"></span>[132:4](sbe2621.htm#fr_361.md) Or rather,
'nave-boards (nabhya).' The cart wheels are described as consisting,
after the fashion prevalent in Malaya (Kâty. VIII, 4, 5 scholl.), of
three parallel boards: the two outer ones form segments, and the middle
and largest one has the nave fixed to it, the axle-pin running through
its centre. It is on this middle board that he is to make the carts
stand. Perhaps 'kshema' should be taken in the sense of 'security, firm
position,' instead of repose, rest,' in which case the upright position
of the middle board would seem to be compared with a man in upright
position; 'nâbhi (nâbhya)' meaning both 'navel' and 'nave.'

<span id="fn_360"></span>[133:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_362.md) Sâya*n*a, on Taitt.
S. I, 2, 13, remarks:--'The southern and northern parts of the yoke
represent the ears of the cart. Through a hole (is effected) the firm
tying (of the yoke parts) to the shafts. At the juncture (sandhi) at the
(place of) fastening of the southern (part of the yoke) the prop is
fixed.' In ordinary practice the prop is put up to support the extreme
end of the shafts or pole.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[133:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_363.md) See [p.
128](#page_128), note [1](#fn_346.md).

<span id="fn_362"></span>[133:3](sbe2621.htm#fr_364.md) Apparently the
parietal bone is meant; or perhaps the frontal bone. The Kâ*n*va text
reads: 'He then touches that reed-mat, or <span id="page_134">p.
134</span> cane-frame, above, with "Let Vish*n*u . . ." for that is for
him (Vish*n*u, the shed) what that skull-bone is up here. And when he
says "they abide upon," it is because that rest on the other skull-bones
\[? adhi hy etad anyeshu kapâleshu kshiyanti!\]. Then what two reed-mats
there are on the two carts, they indeed are for him what the two
skull-bones are here on both sides. And that reed-mat, or cane-frame,
which he puts on there behind (or behind that one), that is for him what
the skull-bone behind is.'

<span id="fn_363"></span>[134:1](sbe2621.htm#fr_365.md) Syû, explained by
Sâya*n*a as 'thread, cord,' by Mahîdhara as 'needle.'

<span id="fn_364"></span>[134:2](sbe2621.htm#fr_366.md) ? Dhruva*h*, the
'firm one,' (? 'pole-star.') The St. Petersburg Dictionary gives the
