### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

##### II. THE GREAT PRESSING <span id="fr_621"></span>[1](#fn_619).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:1">4:1:2:1</span></span>1. The
Upâ*ms*u (graha), forsooth, is his out-breathing, the Upâ*ms*u-savana
(stone) his through-breathing,

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

and the Antaryâma (graha) his in-breathing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:2">4:1:2:2</span></span>2. Now as
to why it is called Antaryâma. That which is the out-breathing is also
the in-breathing and the through-breathing. Now, in drawing the Upâ*ms*u
(graha), he puts into him that out-breathing which tends away from him;
and in drawing the

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Antaryâma, he puts
into him that in-breathing which tends towards him. But this same
in-breathing is confined within his self; and because it is confined
(yam) within (antar) his self, or because these creatures are sustained
(yam) by it, therefore it is called Antaryâma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:3">4:1:2:3</span></span>3. He
draws it from inside the strainer <span id="fr_622"></span>[1](#fn_620),
whereby he puts that in-breathing into him as one tending towards him,
and that in-breathing of his is placed (or beneficial) within his self.
And thereby also that Upâ*ms*u (libation) of his comes to be drawn from
inside the strainer (i.e. from the pure Soma), for one and the same are
the Upâ*ms*u and Antaryâma, since they are the out-breathing and
in-breathing. And thereby, moreover, that (vital air) of his comes to be
unceasing also at the other grahas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:4">4:1:2:4</span></span>4. Now as
to why he purifies the Soma by means of a strainer (pavitra). When Soma
had oppressed his own family-priest B*ri*haspati, he restored to him
(his property); and on his restoring it, he (B*ri*haspati) became
reconciled to him. Still there was guilt remaining, if only for having
contemplated oppressing the priesthood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:5">4:1:2:5</span></span>5. The
gods purified him by some means of purification (or a strainer,
pavitra), and, being cleansed and pure, he became the (sacrificial) food
of the gods. And

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

in like manner does he now purify him by means of that strainer, and,
being cleansed and pure, he becomes the food of the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:6">4:1:2:6</span></span>6. Then
as to why the grahas are drawn with the Upayâma <span
id="fr_623"></span>[1](#fn_621). Now Aditi is this (earth), and hers was
that prâya*n*îya oblation, that Âditya rice-pap <span
id="fr_624"></span>[2](#fn_622). But that was, as it were, previous to
the Soma feast: she desired to have a share along with the gods in the
Soma feast, and said, 'Let there be for me also a share of the pressed
Soma!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:7">4:1:2:7</span></span>7. The
gods said, 'This sacrifice has already been distributed among the
deities: by means of thee the grahas shall be taken and offered to the
deities!'--

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'So be it!' This,
then, is her share of the pressed Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:8">4:1:2:8</span></span>8. And,
again, why the grahas are drawn with the Upayâma. The Upayâma indeed is
this (earth), since it is this (earth) that bears (upa-yam <span
id="fr_625"></span>[1](#fn_623)) food here for cattle and men and trees;
and the gods are above this, for the gods are in heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:9">4:1:2:9</span></span>9. The
reason, then, why the grahas are drawn with the Upayâma, is that they
are drawn by means of this (earth); and why he deposits them in the
womb <span id="fr_626"></span>[2](#fn_624), is that this earth is the
womb of everything, that it is from her that these creatures have
sprung.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:10">4:1:2:10</span></span>10.
That same Soma the priests carry about as seed. And seed which is cast
outside the womb is lost; but that which he deposits in the womb is
indeed deposited in this earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:11">4:1:2:11</span></span>11. Now
these two grahas are his out-breathing and in-breathing; one of them he
offers after sunrise and the other before sunrise, in order to keep the
out-breathing and in-breathing distinct from each other. He thus keeps
the out-breathing and in-breathing distinct from each other: hence these
two, even while being one and the same, are yet called differently
'out-breathing' and 'in-breathing.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:12">4:1:2:12</span></span>12. Now
those two grahas are for him day and night; one of them he offers after
sunrise and the

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

other before sunrise, in order to keep day and night distinct from each
other: he thus keeps day and night distinct. from each other  <span
id="fr_627"></span>[1](#fn_625).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:13">4:1:2:13</span></span>13. The
Upâ*ms*u, being the day, he offers in the night; and thus he puts the
day into the night: whence even in the deepest darkness one
distinguishes something <span id="fr_628"></span>[2](#fn_626).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:14">4:1:2:14</span></span>14. The
Antaryâma, being the night, he offers after sunrise, and thus he puts
the night into the day: whence that sun, on rising, does not burn up
these creatures; whence these creatures are preserved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:15">4:1:2:15</span></span>15. He
draws (the Antaryâma graha) therefrom <span
id="fr_629"></span>[3](#fn_627) with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 4), 'Thou art taken
with a support!'--The significance of the Upayâma has been told <span
id="fr_630"></span>[4](#fn_628).--'Restrain thou, O mighty (Indra),
guard Soma!' the mighty, forsooth, is Indra; and Indra is the leader of
the sacrifice: wherefore he says 'O mighty!' and by 'guard Soma' he
means to say 'protect Soma!' 'Preserve the riches! gain thee food in the
sacrifice!'--riches mean cattle: 'Protect the cattle' he thereby means
to say. 'Gain thee food in the sacrifice!'--food means creatures: he
thus makes these eager to sacrifice, and these creatures go on
sacrificing and praising and toiling.

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:16">4:1:2:16</span></span>16.
'Into thee I lay day and night <span id="fr_631"></span>[1](#fn_629);
into thee I lay the wide air: allied with the gods, the lower and the
higher,'--thereby he makes this (graha) one belonging to all the gods:
because by means of it these creatures move about in the air breathing
out and breathing in, therefore it belongs to all the gods.--'Delight
thyself in the Antaryâma, O mighty one!' the mighty one is Indra, and
Indra is the leader of the sacrifice, wherefore he says 'O mighty one!'
and in that he draws it with 'into--into,' thereby he means to say 'I
lay thee into his (Indra's) self.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:17">4:1:2:17</span></span>17.
Having drawn it, he wipes (the vessel) all round, lest (any Soma-juice)
should trickle down. He does not deposit it; for this is the
in-breathing: hence this in-breathing passes unceasingly. But should he
desire to exorcise, let him deposit it with 'I put thee down, the
in-breathing of N.N.!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:18">4:1:2:18</span></span>18. If
he deposits the Upâ*ms*u, let him also deposit this (Antaryâma
cup) <span id="fr_632"></span>[2](#fn_630); and if he does not deposit
the Upâ*ms*u, let him also not deposit this. And if he covers the
Upâ*ms*u (with his hand), let him also cover this; and if he does not
cover the Upâ*ms*u, let him also not cover this: as the performance
regarding the Upâ*ms*u, so regarding this (graha); for one and the same
are these two, the Upâ*ms*u and Antaryâma, since they are the
out-breathing and in-breathing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:19">4:1:2:19</span></span>19. Now
the *K*arakas, forsooth, offer these two

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (libations) with
two different formulas <span id="fr_633"></span>[1](#fn_631), saying,
'These two are his out-breathing and in-breathing: we make the
out-breathing and in-breathing of varied vigour.' But let him not do
this, for they disorder the sacrificer's out-breathing and in-breathing.
Now, one might also <span id="fr_634"></span>[2](#fn_632) offer this one
silently:--

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:20">4:1:2:20</span></span>20.
But, as he offers the Upâ*ms*u with a formula, even thereby this
(libation) also comes to be offered with a formula. How then could one
offer it silently, for these two, the Upâ*ms*u and Antaryâma, are one
and the same, since they are the out-breathing and in-breathing?

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:21">4:1:2:21</span></span>21.
With the very same formula with which he offers the Upâ*ms*u, he offers
this (libation),--'Self-made thou art: for all powers divine and
earthly: may the mind obtain thee! Hail!--thee, O well-born, for Sûrya!'
The significance of this formula has been told.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:22">4:1:2:22</span></span>22.
And, having offered <span id="fr_635"></span>[3](#fn_633), he wipes the
cup clean downwards. For even now, after offering the Upâ*ms*u, he wiped
(the cup) upwards; but here he wipes it downwards; whereby he puts the
in-breathing into him as one tending towards him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:23">4:1:2:23</span></span>23. He
then rubs (the wiped-off Soma) upon the middle enclosing stick from east
to west with the palm of his hand turned downwards. For even now, after
offering the Upâ*ms*u, he rubbed it upon the

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

middle enclosing stick from west to east with the palm of his hand
turned upwards; but here he does so from east to west with the palm of
his hand turned downwards--whereby he puts the in-breathing into him as
one tending towards him--with, 'Thee for the gods sipping motes of
light!' The significance is the same as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:24">4:1:2:24</span></span>24.
Having returned (to the cart-shed), he deposits that (cup) with, 'Thee
for the in-breathing!' for this is indeed his in-breathing. He deposits
them <span id="fr_636"></span>[1](#fn_634) so as to touch one another;
whereby he makes out-breathing and in-breathing touch one another, joins
the out-breathings and in-breathings together.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:25">4:1:2:25</span></span>25. Now
these (cups and stone) repose without being moved until the evening Soma
feast, whence men sleep here on earth; and at the evening Soma feast
they are used again, whence these men, having slept, awake and are
bustling and restless;--this, forsooth, is after the manner of the
sacrifice, for the sacrifice is fashioned like a bird: the Upâ*ms*u and
Antaryâma (grahas) are its wings, and the Upâ*ms*usavana (stone) its
body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:26">4:1:2:26</span></span>26.
They repose without being moved until the evening Soma feast. The
sacrifice is spread along; but what is spread along moves, whence those
birds fly spreading their wings, not drawing them in. At the evening
Soma feast they are again used; whence

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

these birds fly drawing in their wings to fold them: this indeed is
after the manner of the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:2:27">4:1:2:27</span></span>27. The
Upâ*ms*u, forsooth, is this (earth), for the Upâ*ms*u is the
out-breathing, and breathing out one breathes upon this (earth). And the
Antaryâma is yonder (sky), for the Upâ*ms*u is the in-breathing
(up-breathing), and in breathing up one breathes towards yonder world.
And the Upâ*ms*u-savana (stone) is the air, for the Upâ*ms*u-savana is
the through-breathing, and he who breathes through (in and out),
breathes through this air.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_619"></span>[256:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_621) The 'Great
Pressing' (mahâbhishava) from which the Antaryâma and following
libations are obtained is performed by the four priests, viz. the
Adhvaryu and his three assistants, Pratiprasthât*ri*, Nesh*tri* and
Unnet*ri*, each having an equal portion of Soma-plants and one of the
four remaining pressing-stones assigned to him. The ceremonies mentioned
in [III, 9, 4, 1](sbe2639.htm#3:9:4:1) seq. are repeated on the present
occasion, each of the priests tying a piece of gold to his ring-finger.
The pressing is performed in three rounds of three turns each, the
number of single strokes of the several turns <span id="page_257">p.
257</span> being, however, not limited, as was the case at the pressing
of the Upâ*ms*u. Only before the first turn of each round Nigrâbhyâ
water is poured on the plants. After each turn the scattered plants are
gathered together on a heap. At the end of each round (of three turns)
the Soma is touched (or 'strengthened'); whereupon the completely
pressed-out stalks are thrown into the Hot*ri*'s cup and the Nigrâbha
formula is pronounced ([III, 9, 4, 21](sbe2639.htm#3:9:4:21)). The
stalks which are still juicy are then 'gathered together' (see [III, 9,
4, 19](sbe2639.htm#3:9:4:19)) into the so-called sambhara*n*î and poured
into the Âdhavanîya trough, and having been stirred about therein by the
Unnet*ri*, are taken out, pressed out, and thrown on the skin, when the
same process is repeated. On the completion of the third round the
Dro*n*akala*s*a is brought forward (from behind the axle of the southern
cart) by the Udgât*ri*s (for the mantras used by them see Tâ*nd*ya Br.
I, 2, 6-7) and placed on the four stones covered with the pressed-out
Soma husks, the straining-cloth being then stretched over it, with the
fringe towards the north. The Hot*ri*'s cup (held by the sacrificer and
containing the remaining Nigrâbhyâ water) having then been filled up by
the Unnet*ri* with the Soma-juice in the Âdhavanîya trough, the
sacrificer pours it in one continuous stream from the Hot*ri*'s cup upon
the straining-cloth, spread over the Dro*n*akala*s*a by the chanters
(Udgât*ri*s), muttering a mantra (Tâ*nd*ya Br. I, 2, 9) all the time.
From this stream the first eight (at the midday pressing the first five)
libations are taken, by the respective cups being held under, the
remaining libations or cups being drawn either from the strained (or
'pure,' *s*ukra) Soma-juice in the Dro*n*akala*s*a, or from the
Âgraya*n*asthâlî or the Pûtabh*ri*t. Sâya*n*a on Ait. Br. II, 22, 1
seems to exclude the Antaryâma graha from the 'great pressing:'
antaryâmagrahahomâd ûrdhvam mahâbhishava*m* k*ri*tvâ. Also in II, 21, 1
he mentions the Dadhi graha, A*ms*u graha, and Adâbhya graha (see [p.
255](sbe2640.htm#page_255), n. [2](sbe2640.htm#fn_618)) as intervening
between the Aponaptrîya ceremony and the drawing of the Upâ*ms*u graha.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[258:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_622) Anta*h*pavitrât,
lit. from (the vessel or stream of Soma) which has the strainer inside
it; the straining-cloth being spread over the Dro*n*akala*s*a, into
which the pressed-out Soma-juice is poured. The Petersburg Dictionary
assigns to it the meaning 'the Soma within the filtering vessel' (see
[IV, 1, 1, 3](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:3)). Perhaps it means 'from that which
has a strainer between,' i.e. from the poured-out stream from which the
libation is taken, and which is separated from the Dro*n*akala*s*a by
the straining-cloth.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[259:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_623) The term Upayâma,
lit. 'foundation, substratum,' referring properly to 'that which is held
under' while taking the libation, that is, the cup of the respective
graha (and hence also identified with the earth, as the substratum of
everything, cf. Sây. on Taitt. S. I, 4, 3), has come to be applied
likewise to the formula 'upayâmag*ri*hîto ’si,' i.e. 'thou art taken
with (or on) a support,' which is repeated at those libations before the
formulas muttered while they are drawn into the respective vessels or
cups (see [par. 15](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:15)). Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p.
118 note, makes the following distinction between the graha (cup) and
pâtra (vessel) of the Antaryâma (and Upâ*ms*u) libation: 'The pâtra is a
vessel resembling a large wooden jar with but a very slight cavity on
the top, in which the Soma-juice is filled. The graha is a small cup,
like a saucer, made of earth, and put over the cavity of the Soma
vessel, in order to cover the "precious" juice. The bottom of it is
first put in water, and a gold leaf placed beneath it. There are as many
grahas as there are pâtras; they belong together just as cup and saucer,
and are regarded as inseparable. The word graha is, however, taken often
in the sense of the whole, meaning both graha and pâtra.' I doubt,
however, whether this distinction is in accordance with the old
authorities. The graha vessels or cups are described as resembling the
shape of a mortar. For other peculiarities, see [IV, I, 5,
19](sbe2644.htm#4:1:5:19). With some libations there is both a pâtra
(cup) and a sthâlî (bowl).

<span id="fn_622"></span>[259:2](sbe2641.htm#fr_624) See [III, 2, 3,
1](sbe2609.htm#3:2:3:1) seq.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[260:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_625) Lit. forms the
support or basis for it. The sentence could also be translated, 'this
earth doubtless is an upayâma (support), since she bears food.'
Apparently he means to say that, as the gods are above, the food to he
offered to them requires some support, something to 'hold it up' by for
the gods to reach it.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[260:2](sbe2641.htm#fr_626) This refers to the
formula 'This is thy womb,' with which most libations, after being
drawn, are deposited in their proper place on the khara until they are
used for offering. See [IV, 1, 3, 19](sbe2642.htm#4:1:3:19).

<span id="fn_625"></span>[261:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_627) 'Were he to offer
both after sunrise, there would only be day, and no night; and were he
to offer both before sunrise, there would only be night, and no day.'
Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[261:2](sbe2641.htm#fr_628) Tasmâd y ida*m*
râtrau tamasi sati nir*gñ*âyata iva ki*mk*id iva. Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[261:3](sbe2641.htm#fr_629) Viz. from the
stream of Soma poured from the Hot*ri*'s cup on the straining-cloth. See
[p. 256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note [1](#fn_619).

<span id="fn_628"></span>[261:4](sbe2641.htm#fr_630) See [paragraph
6](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:6), with note.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[262:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_631) Mahîdhara offers
the alternative interpretation, 'through thee I place day and night
between (Soma and the enemies),' which is also Sâya*n*a's interpretation
on Taitt. S. I, 4, 3; as apparently that of the Taitt. S. itself, VI, 4,
6.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[262:2](sbe2641.htm#fr_632) See [IV, 1, 1,
17](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:17)-[18](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:18).

<span id="fn_631"></span>[263:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_633) This does not
appear to refer to the Taittirîyas, since by them the same order of
proceeding is prescribed for the Antaryâma as for the Upâ*ms*u ([p.
252](sbe2640.htm#page_252), note [2](sbe2640.htm#fn_608)); cf. Sâya*n*a
on Taitt. S. I, p. 603. See, however, Maitrây. Sa*m*h. I, 3, 4-5.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[263:2](sbe2641.htm#fr_634) 'Apîd (vai)' seems
to have much the same meaning ('perhaps') as the later 'api nâma.' Cf.
I, 9, 1, 19.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[263:3](sbe2641.htm#fr_635) He offers the
entire Soma in the Antaryâma cup, without leaving any, or pouring any
juice into the Âgraya*n*asthâlî.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[264:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_636) According to the
Kâ*n*va text he is to place the Antaryâma cup on the south-east corner
(dakshi*n*ârdhe) of the khara (see [p. 255](sbe2640.htm#page_255), n.
[2](sbe2640.htm#fn_618)); while, according to Kâty. IX, 2, I, both the
Upâ*ms*u and Antaryâma are to be placed on the north-east corner, the
former south of the latter. This arrangement, however, would scarcely
agree with [IV, I, 1,
27](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:27)-[28](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:28). The
Upâ*ms*u-savana stone, doubtless, is to lie between the two cups, with
its face towards the Upâ*ms*u.

[Next: IV, 1, 3. Third Brâhma*n*a](sbe2642)
