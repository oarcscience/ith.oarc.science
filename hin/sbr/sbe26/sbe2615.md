#### THE ÂTI*TH*YA, OR GUEST-OFFERING (HOSPITABLE RECEPTION GIVEN TO KING SOMA).

### FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:1">3:4:1:1</span></span>1.
Verily, the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the
Prâya*n*îya and Udayanîya are its arms. But the arms are on both sides
of the head: therefore those two oblations, the Prâya*n*îya and
Udayanîya, are on both sides of the guest-offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:2">3:4:1:2</span></span>2. Now as
to why it is called 'guest-offering.' He, the purchased Soma, truly
comes as his (the sacrificer's) guest,--to him (is offered) that
(hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brâhman one would cook a
large ox or a large he-goat--for that is human (fare offered to a
guest), and the oblation is that of the gods--so he prepares for him
that guest-offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:3">3:4:1:3</span></span>3. Here
now they say, 'Let him first walk past (Soma) and take out (the material
for offering)!' For (they argue) where people do not show respect

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

to a worthy person (arhant) who has come to them, he becomes angry,--and
in this way he (Soma) is indeed honoured.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:4">3:4:1:4</span></span>4. Then
only one (of the oxen) is to be unyoked, and the other to be left
unyoked <span id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_225); and thereupon he is to
take out (the material for offering): for (they argue) in that one of
them is unyoked, thereby he (Soma) has arrived; and in that the other is
left unyoked, thereby he is honoured.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:5">3:4:1:5</span></span>5. Let
him, however, not do this but let him take out (the material for
offering) only after unyoking (both oxen) and after making (Soma) enter
(the hall); for the ways of men are in accordance with those of the
gods. And accordingly, in human practice, so long as (a guest) has not
unyoked, people do not bring water to him and show him no honour, for so
long he has not yet arrived; but when he has unyoked, then they bring
him water and show him honour, for then he has indeed arrived: let him
therefore take out (the material for offering) only after unyoking and
after making (Soma) enter (the hall).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:6">3:4:1:6</span></span>6. Let
him take it out with all speed, for thus he (Soma) is honoured. The
housewife holds on to it from behind <span
id="fr_227"></span>[2](#fn_226); for the sacrificer holds on to him
(Soma), while he is driven around, and here his wife does so. Thus they
enclose him on the two sides by a (married) couple: and, indeed,
wherever a

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

worthy person comes, there all the inmates of the house bestir
themselves, for thus he is honoured.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:7">3:4:1:7</span></span>7. Let
him take out (the material) with a different formula from that wherewith
(one takes out) any other oblations <span
id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_227), since, when he (Soma) is bought, he is
bought for one special destination,--for the sovereignty of the metres,
for the supreme sovereignty of the metres. The metres act as attendants
about him; even as the non-royal king-makers, the heralds and headmen,
(attend upon) the king, so do the metres act as attendants about him
(Soma).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:8">3:4:1:8</span></span>8. In no
wise, then, is it befitting that he should take out any (material for
offering) solely 'for the metres <span id="fr_229"></span>[2](#fn_228);'
for whenever people cook food for some worthy person <span
id="fr_230"></span>[3](#fn_229), then the attendants about him, the
non-royal king-makers, the heralds and headmen, have their share (of the
food) assigned to them; after (or along with their master): hence, when
he takes out that (oblation to Soma), let him assign the metres a share
in it along with (the deity).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:9">3:4:1:9</span></span>9. He
takes it out, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. V, 1), 'Thou art Agni's
body,--thee (I take) for Vish*n*u!' the Gâyatrî is Agni: to Gâyatrî he
thus assigns her share.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:10">3:4:1:10</span></span>10.
'Thou art Soma's body,--thee for Vish*n*u!' Soma is the nobility, and
the Trish*t*ubh

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

is the nobility: to Trish*t*ubh he thus assigns her share.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:11">3:4:1:11</span></span>11.
'Thou art the guest's hospitable entertainment <span
id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_230),--thee for Vish*n*u!' This is his
(Soma's) special share: as there is a special share for a chief, so is
this his special share apart from the metres.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:12">3:4:1:12</span></span>12.
'Thee for the Soma-bearing falcon! thee for Vish*n*u!' thereby he
assigns to Gâyatrî her share. Because Gâyatrî, in the form of a falcon,
carried off Soma from the sky, therefore she is the Soma-bearing falcon:
in virtue of that heroic deed he now assigns to her a second share.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:13">3:4:1:13</span></span>13.
'Thee for Agni, the bestower of prosperity! thee for Vish*n*u!'
Prosperity means cattle, and the *G*agatî (the moving, living one) means
cattle: to *G*agatî he thereby assigns her share.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:14">3:4:1:14</span></span>14. Now
as to his taking five times;--the sacrifice is of equal measure with the
year, and five seasons there are in the year: the latter he gains in
five (divisions);--for this reason he takes five times. And as to his
taking it with 'For Vish*n*u (I take) thee! for Vish*n*u thee!' it is
because he who takes out (material) for the sacrifice, takes it for
Vish*n*u.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:15">3:4:1:15</span></span>15. It
is a sacrificial cake on nine potsherds;--for the guest-offering is the
head of the sacrifice, and the Gâyatrî consists of nine syllables <span
id="fr_232"></span>[2](#fn_231): eight (syllables) are those he recites
and the sacred syllable <span id="fr_233"></span>[3](#fn_232) is the
ninth; and the Gâyatrî is the fore-part of the

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

sacrifice <span id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_233), and so is that (cake)
the fore-part of the sacrifice: therefore it is a cake on nine
potsherds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:16">3:4:1:16</span></span>16. The
enclosing-sticks are of kârshmarya wood (Gmelina Arborea <span
id="fr_235"></span>[2](#fn_234)), for the gods, once upon a time,
perceived that one, the kârshmarya, to be the Rakshas-killer among
trees. Now, the guest-offering being the head of the sacrifice, the
enclosing-sticks are of kârshmarya wood, in order that the evil spirits
may not injure the head of the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:17">3:4:1:17</span></span>17. The
prastara-bunch <span id="fr_236"></span>[3](#fn_235) is of
a*s*vavâla-grass (Saccharum Spontaneum). For, once upon a time, the
sacrifice escaped from the gods. It became a horse (a*s*va) and sped
away from them. The gods, rushing after it, took hold of its tail (vâla)
and tore it out; and having torn it out, they threw it down in a lump,
and what had been the hairs of the horse's tail then grew up as those
plants (of a*s*vavâla-grass). Now the guest-offering is the head of the
sacrifice, and the tail is the hind-part (of animals): hence by the
prastara being of a*s*vavâla-grass he encompasses the sacrifice on both
sides.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:18">3:4:1:18</span></span>18.
There are two vidh*ri*tis <span id="fr_237"></span>[4](#fn_236) of
sugar-cane, lest

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

the barhis and the prastara should become mixed up together. Having then
purified the ghee <span id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_237), he takes all
the butter-portions in four ladlings <span
id="fr_239"></span>[2](#fn_238), for at this (sacrifice) there are no
after-offerings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:19">3:4:1:19</span></span>19.
When he has placed the sacrificial dishes (on the altar) <span
id="fr_240"></span>[3](#fn_239), he churns the fire. For the
guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice; and in churning (the fire)
they produce that (sacrifice); and one who is born is born with the head
first: hence he thereby makes the sacrifice to be produced with the head
first. Further, Agni means all the gods, since offering is made in the
fire to all gods; and the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice:
hence, through all the deities, he secures success to the sacrifice from
the very head (beginning). This is why he churns the fire <span
id="fr_241"></span>[4](#fn_240).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:20">3:4:1:20</span></span>20. He
takes the bottom piece of wood <span id="fr_242"></span>[5](#fn_241),
with the text (Vâ*g*. S. V, 2), 'Thou art the birth-place of Agni;' for
it is thereon that Agni is produced: hence he says, 'Thou art the
birth-place of Agni.'

21\. Thereon he lays two sprouts of a ku*s*a stalk (with the tops
towards the east), with, 'Ye are

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

males <span id="fr_243"></span>[1](#fn_242);' thereby these two are as
two (sons) born together here from a woman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:22">3:4:1:22</span></span>22.
Thereon he lays the lower churning-stick (with the top to the north),
with, 'Thou art Urva*s*î!' He then touches the (ghee in the) ghee-pan
with the upper churning-stick, with, 'Thou art Âyu,' he puts it down (on
the lower ara*n*i) with, 'Thou art Purûravas.' For Urva*s*î was a nymph,
and Purûravas was her husband; and the (child) which sprung from that
union was Âyu <span id="fr_244"></span>[2](#fn_243): in like manner does
he now produce the sacrifice from that union. Thereupon he says (to the
Hot*ri*), 'Recite to Agni, as he is churned <span
id="fr_245"></span>[3](#fn_244)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:23">3:4:1:23</span></span>23. He
churns, with the texts, 'With the Gâyatrî metre I churn thee!--With the
Trish*t*ubh metre I churn thee!--With the Gagatî metre I churn thee!'
For it is with the metres that he churns him (Agni, the fire); the
metres he recites to him when he is churned, whereby he attaches the
metres to the sacrifice, even as the rays (are attached) to yonder
sun.--'Recite to the born one!' he says,

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

when he (Agni) is produced <span id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_245); and
'To him who is thrown <span id="fr_247"></span>[2](#fn_246)!' when he
throws him (on the old Âhavanîya fire).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:24">3:4:1:24</span></span>24. He
throws (the fire on the hearth), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. V, 3), 'For
our sake be ye two (fires) friendly to one another, of one mind,
unblemished! Injure not the sacrifice, nor the lord of the sacrifice! be
gracious unto us this day, ye knowers of beings!' He thus bespeaks
peacefulness between them, that they may not injure each other.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:25">3:4:1:25</span></span>25. He
then takes out some clarified butter with the dipping-spoon, and pours
it on the fire, with the text (Vâg. S. V, 4), 'Agni resorteth to Agni,
he the son of the seers that shieldeth us from curses: graciously offer
thou for us now with good offering, never withholding the oblation from
the gods, Hail!' For the purpose of offering they have produced him, and
by this offering he has now gratified him: that is why he thus makes
offering unto him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:1:26">3:4:1:26</span></span>26. It
(the guest-offering) ends with the I*d*â; no after-offerings are
performed. For the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the
head is the fore-part: he thus fits him up as the head of the sacrifice.
But were he to perform the after-offerings, it would be as if, by
reversing, he were to put the feet in the place of the head. Hence it
ends with the I*d*â, and no after-offerings are performed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_225"></span>[86:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_226) This is the practice
recognised by the Taittirîyas (T. S. VI, 2, 1, 1), on the ground that,
if one were to unyoke both oxen, he would interrupt the sacrifice; and
if he were to leave them both unyoked, it would be as if a hospitable
reception were given to one who has not actually arrived.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[86:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_227) That is, by touching
the Adhvaryu while he takes out the sacrificial food. See [p.
79](sbe2614.htm#page_79), note [3](sbe2614.htm#fn_210).

<span id="fn_227"></span>[87:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_228) For the ordinary
formula with which material for offering is taken out at an ish*t*i, 'At
the impulse of the divine Savit*ri*, I take thee with the arms of the
A*s*vins, with the hands of Pûshan, thee well-pleasing to--!' see I, 1,
2, 17.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[87:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_229) According to Taitt.
S. VI, 2, 1, the five portions are taken out for the metres Gâyatrî,
Trish*t*ubh, *G*agatî, Anush*t*ubh, and Gâyatrî, with the texts, 'Thou
art Agni's hospitable feast, for Vish*n*u (I take) thee,' &c.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[87:3](sbe2615.htm#fr_230) 'Arhant' seems
rather to mean 'ruler' here.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[88:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_231) Atither âtithyam,
'the guest's guest-meal.'

<span id="fn_231"></span>[88:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_232) According to Taitt.
S. VI, 2, 1, 4, it is because the head has nine seams, 'navadhâ *s*iro
vishyûtam.'

<span id="fn_232"></span>[88:3](sbe2615.htm#fr_233) The final syllable
of the prayers recited in offering is protracted and nasalized, a final
'a' becoming ô*m*,--this drawing out of the syllable is called
pra*n*ava.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[89:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_234) Because the Gâyatrî
metre is connected with the prâta*h*savana or morning pressing. See [IV,
2, 5, 20](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:20) seq.; Ait. Br. III, 27 seq.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[89:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_235) See I, 3, 3, 19-20,
where the approved kinds of wood for the paridhis at an ish*t*i are
enumerated.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[89:3](sbe2615.htm#fr_236) For the prastara, or
bunch of reed-grass, representing the sacrificer, see I, 3, 3, 5 seq.;
8, 3. 11 seq. The a*s*vavâla (horsetail) grass (generally called kâ*s*a)
is said to resemble horse-hair, and is used for twine, mats, thatch, &c.
Sir H. M. Elliot, 'Races of the N. W. Prov.' II, pp. 371, 372, describes
it as growing from three to fifteen feet high, and flowering in great
profusion after the rains; the base of the flowers being surrounded with
a bright silvery fleece, which whitens the neighbouring fields so much
as frequently to resemble a fall of snow.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[89:4](sbe2615.htm#fr_237) For the vidh*ri*ti
or stalks laid across the barhis (sacrificial <span id="page_90">p.
90</span> grass covering the altar), to keep the prastara separate from
the latter when laid upon it, see I, 3, 4, 10. As no special mention is
made of the barhis, the same material has to be used for it as at the
model ish*t*i (New and Full-moon sacrifice), viz. Ku*s*a grass (Poa
Cynosuroides).

<span id="fn_237"></span>[90:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_238) See I, 3, 1, 22-23.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[90:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_239) See I, 3, 2, 8-9.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[90:3](sbe2615.htm#fr_240) See I, 3, 4, 14.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[90:4](sbe2615.htm#fr_241) On the production of
the fire by 'churning,' see part i, p. 294, note 3.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[90:5](sbe2615.htm#fr_242) The adhimanthana
*s*akala is a chip of wood used for the lower churning-stick
(adharâra*n*i), wherein the upper churning-stick is drilled, to rest
upon. It is laid down on the altar-grass (barhis) from south to north.
According to Sâya*n*a it is a chip obtained in rough-hewing the
sacrificial stake.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[91:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_243) In this sense
'v*ri*sha*n*au' is taken by Mahîdhara (sektârau, from v*ri*shan),
Sâya*n*a, and apparently also by our author. Perhaps it means
'testicles' (v*ri*sha*n*a) in the text. See [III, 6, 3,
10](sbe2625.htm#3:6:3:10); and part i, p. 389, note 3.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[91:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_244) The myth of
Purûravas and Urva*s*î is given at length XI, 5, 1, I-17. Compare also
Max Müller, Chips, vol. ii, p.202 seq.; A. Kuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers,
p. 78 seq.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[91:3](sbe2615.htm#fr_245) The verses which the
Hot*ri* has to recite are (a) one to Savit*ri* (the Vivifier, viz.
Rig-veda I, 24, 3); (b) to Heaven and Earth (IV, 56, s); (c) a triplet
to Agni (VI, 16, 13-15). If fire has not appeared by this time, he
recites the so-called Rakshas-killing verses (X, 118), repeating them
until fire has been produced. See Ait. Br. I, 17; Â*s*v. *S*r. II, 16.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[92:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_246) The Hot*ri* recites
the two verses, Rig-veda I, 74, 3; VI, 16, 40.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[92:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_247) The verb is
'pra-h*ri*,' which is also the common term for the hurling of the
thunderbolt. The six verses, recited by the Hot*ri*; are Rig-veda VI,
16, 41-42; I, 12, 6; VIII, 43, 14; VIII, 73, 8; I, 164, 50.
