### EIGHTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:1">4:5:8:1</span></span>1. Now
when at that Trirâtra <span id="fr_969"></span>[1](#fn_963) sacrifice he
gives those thousand (cows), then that one is made the
one-thousandth <span id="fr_970"></span>[2](#fn_964). On the first day
he brings three hundred and thirty-three; and likewise on the second day
he brings three hundred and thirty-three; and likewise on the third day
he brings three hundred and thirty-three. Then that one-thousandth is
left over.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:2">4:5:8:2</span></span>2. She
should be three-coloured, they say, for that is the most perfect form
for her. But let it be a red one, and spotted, for that indeed is the
most perfect form for her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:3">4:5:8:3</span></span>3. Let it
be one that has not been approached (by a bull), for she, the Sâhasrî,
is in reality Vâ*k* (speech); but Vâ*k*, forsooth, is of unimpaired
vigour, and so is one of unimpaired vigour which has not been
approached: therefore it should be one that has not been approached.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:4">4:5:8:4</span></span>4. He may
lead her up (to the sacrificial ground) on the first day; for she, the
Sâhasrî, is in reality Vâ*k*, and hers, Vâ*k*'s, is that thousandfold
progeny <span id="fr_971"></span>[3](#fn_965).

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> She walks at the
head (of the other 333 cows), and behind her follows her progeny. Or he
may lead her up on the last day; then her progeny precedes her, and she
herself walks behind. This, however, is mere speculation: let him lead
her up on the last day,--her progeny precedes her, and she herself walks
behind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:5">4:5:8:5</span></span>5. North
of the Havirdhâna shed, and south of the Âgnîdhra fire-house he makes
her smell the Dro*n*akala*s*a; for the Dro*n*akala*s*a is the sacrifice;
thus he makes her see the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:6">4:5:8:6</span></span>6. With
(Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 42), 'Smell the trough: may the drops enter thee, O
mighty one!' Now he who gives a thousand (cows) becomes, as it were,
emptied: him, thus emptied, he thereby replenishes, when he says, 'Smell
the trough: may the drops enter thee, O mighty one!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:7">4:5:8:7</span></span>7.
'Return again with sap!' him who is emptied he thus replenishes when he
says, 'Return again with sap!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:8">4:5:8:8</span></span>8. 'And
milk to us a thousandfold!' him who is emptied he thus replenishes with
a thousand (forces), when he says, 'And milk to us a thousandfold!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:9">4:5:8:9</span></span>9.
'Broad-streamed, milk-abounding,--may wealth come back to me!' him who
is emptied he thus replenishes when he says, 'May wealth come back to
me!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:10">4:5:8:10</span></span>10. He
then mutters in her right ear, 'O I*d*â, blithesome, adorable, lovable,
bright, shining, Aditi (inviolable), *S*arasvatî (sapful), mighty,

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

glorious,--these are thy names, O cow: tell thou the gods of me as a
doer of good!'--or, 'speak thou . . .' These indeed are her names with
the gods: he thus means to say, 'whatever thy names are with the gods,
therewith tell the gods of me as a doer of good.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:11">4:5:8:11</span></span>11.
They release her. If, not urged by any man, she goes eastwards, then let
him know that this sacrificer has succeeded, that he has won the happy
world. If she goes northwards, let him know that the sacrificer will be
more glorious in this world. If she goes westwards, let him know that he
will be rich in dependants and crops. If she goes southwards, let him
know that the sacrificer will quickly depart from this world. Such are
the ways of knowledge.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:12">4:5:8:12</span></span>12. And
what three (cows) there are each time over and above the (three hundred
and) thirty, thereto they add that one <span
id="fr_972"></span>[1](#fn_966). Now, when they draw out a Virâ*g*
(verse), they pull it asunder, and a Virâ*g* which is pulled asunder is
torn in two;--and the Virâ*g* consisting of ten syllables, he thus makes
the Virâ*g* complete. Let him give her to the Hot*ri*; for the Hot*ri*
is a thousandfold <span id="fr_973"></span>[2](#fn_967): therefore let
him give her to the Hot*ri*.

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:13">4:5:8:13</span></span>13. Or
let him appoint two Unnet*ri*s, and let him give her to him, of the two,
who does not call for the *S*rausha*t*; for defective, indeed, is he
who, being an officiating priest, does not call for the *S*rausha*t*;
and defective also is the Virâ*g* which is pulled asunder: thus he puts
the defective to the defective.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:14">4:5:8:14</span></span>14. Now
they say, one ought not to give anything above a thousand (cows),
because by a thousand he obtains all the objects of his desire. But
Âsuri said, 'Let him give according to his wish: by a thousand he indeed
obtains all his wishes; and anything else (that he gives) is likewise
given at his wish <span id="fr_974"></span>[1](#fn_968).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:15">4:5:8:15</span></span>15. And
should he intend to give a cart yoked (with a team of oxen), or
something else, let him give it either after the offering of the omentum
of the barren cow, or at the concluding (udavasânîyâ) offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:8:16">4:5:8:16</span></span>16. In
bringing the dakshi*n*âs, let him bring complete decads. If he intends
to give one (cow) to any (priest), let him pass over a decad to ten such
(priests). If he intends to give two to any one, let him pass over a
decad to five such (priests). If he intends to give three to any one,
let him pass over a decad to three such <span
id="fr_975"></span>[2](#fn_969). If he intends to give five to

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

any one, let him pass over a decad to two such. Thus up to a hundred:
and thus this perfect Virâ*g* of his becomes a cow of plenty for him in
yonder world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_963"></span>[414:1](sbe2667.htm#fr_969) The
Sahasradakshi*n*a Trirâtra, or sacrifice of three (pressing) days, with
a thousand cows as the priests’ fee, is mentioned Kâty. XIII, 4, 35 seq.
as, apparently, an independent Ahîna sacrifice. I do not, however, know
whether it might not be added on to some other sacrificial performance,
as, for instance, to the P*ri*sh*th*ya sha*d*aha, thus forming together
with this the Navarâtra (or first nine days of the Da*s*arâtra, see [p.
402](sbe2662.htm#page_402), note [2](sbe2663.htm#fn_935)). Kâty. gives
no indication as to the particular forms of Soma-sacrifice required for
the several days; but, guided no doubt by the Brâhma*n*a, he confines
his remarks to the manner of distribution of the dakshi*n*âs.

<span id="fn_964"></span>[414:2](sbe2667.htm#fr_970) Sâhasrî, lit. 'she
who makes the dakshi*n*â to consist of one thousand.'

<span id="fn_965"></span>[414:3](sbe2667.htm#fr_971) Or,--and from her,
Vâ*k*, those thousand (cows) were produced; <span id="page_415">p.
415</span> or,--and from her (the thousandth cow) that thousandfold
progeny of Vâ*k* was produced; see [IV, 6, 7, 3](sbe2676.htm#4:6:7:3),
where the thousandfold progeny of Vâ*k* is identified with the Vedic
texts generally.

<span id="fn_966"></span>[416:1](sbe2667.htm#fr_972) I am not certain
whether I understand this passage rightly. According to [paragraph
16](sbe2667.htm#4:5:8:16), and Kâty. XIII, 4, 23, he is to give away the
cows by tens. This would leave three each day, or nine on the three
days. To them he is to add the Sâhasrî, and give the ten cows to the
Hot*ri*.--A common Virâ*g* verse consists of three times ten syllables;
but there are also such as consist of three times eleven syllables.
These latter the sacrificer is thus represented (by withholding three
cows out of thirty-three) to make into a proper Virâ*g*.

<span id="fn_967"></span>[416:2](sbe2667.htm#fr_973) That is, according
to the St. Petersb. Dict., he possesses a <span id="page_417">p.
417</span> thousand verses;--if it does not rather refer to the extent
of the Rig-veda, consisting of rather more than a thousand (1028) hymns.
Cp. also 'the thousandfold progeny of Vâ*k*,' [p. 414](#page_414), note
[3](#fn_965).

<span id="fn_968"></span>[417:1](sbe2667.htm#fr_974) The Kâ*n*va text
has much the same reasoning, but does not ascribe it to any one.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[417:2](sbe2667.htm#fr_975) In this and all
other cases the text has 'to those three (ten &c.).' It is not clear in
what manner he is to divide the ten cows between the three priests,
unless indeed he is to repeat the same process three times, giving the
odd cow each time to another priest. The Kâ*n*va text only mentions two
of the cases here given, viz. that if he intends to give one cow to each
(ekaikâm), <span id="page_418">p. 418</span> he is to give ten to ten
such; and if he intends to give two to each, he is to give ten to five
such. Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 52, remarks that this paragraph is
not clear to him, and suggests that it may be interpolated. It does not
appear, what the exact proportion of the thousand cows is for each of
the sixteen priests; but we may assume that it did not differ much from
that given at the Agnish*t*oma (see [p. 345](sbe2653.htm#page_345), note
[1](sbe2653.htm#fn_810)), and that this result was brought about by
repeated distributions among varied groupings of the priests.
