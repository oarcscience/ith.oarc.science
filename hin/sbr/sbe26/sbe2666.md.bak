### SEVENTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:7:1">4:5:7:1</span></span>1. Now,
there are here thirty-four utterances, called expiations <span
id="fr_959"></span>[1](#fn_953.md). Pra*g*âpati, forsooth, is that
sacrifice which is performed here, and from which these creatures have
been produced,--and in like manner are they produced therefrom even to
this day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:7:2">4:5:7:2</span></span>2. There
are eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Âdityas; and these two, Heaven
and Earth, are the (thirty-second and) thirty-third. And there are
thirty-three gods, and Pra*g*âpati is the thirty-fourth;--thus he makes
him (the sacrificer, or Ya*gñ*a) to be Pra*g*âpati <span
id="fr_960"></span>[2](#fn_954.md): now that <span
id="fr_961"></span>[3](#fn_955.md) is, for that is immortal, and what is
immortal that is. But what is mortal that also is Pra*g*âpati; for
Pra*g*âpati is everything: thus he makes him to be Pra*g*âpati, and
hence there are these thirty-four utterances, called expiations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:7:3">4:5:7:3</span></span>3. Now
some call these (formulas) the 'forms of the sacrifice;' but, indeed,
they are rather the joints of the sacrifice: this same sacrifice, in
being performed, is continually becoming those deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:7:4">4:5:7:4</span></span>4. Now
should the cow, which supplies the gharma <span
id="fr_962"></span>[4](#fn_956), fail (to give milk.md), let them go to
another; and at the same place where they otherwise make that gharma
(milk) flow <span id="fr_963"></span>[5](#fn_957.md), let them place her
with her

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

head towards the north, or in front of the hall with her face to the
east.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:7:5">4:5:7:5</span></span>5. And
that which is the right one of the two bones with hair-tufts which
protrude on both sides of her tail-bone,--thereon he offers those
thirty-four oblations of ghee; for as much as are those thirty-four
utterances, so much is the sacrifice: thus he lays the whole sacrifice
entirely into her; for therefrom she lets the gharma (milk) flow, and
this is the atonement therefore.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:7:6">4:5:7:6</span></span>6. And if
any part of the sacrifice were to fail, let him make an oblation with
regard thereto on the Âhavanîya during the consecration and the Upasads,
and on the Âgnîdhra during the Soma feast--for whatever point of the
sacrifice fails, that breaks--and whichever then is the deity in that
(special offering), through that one he heals it, through that he puts
it together again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:7:7">4:5:7:7</span></span>7. And if
anything <span id="fr_964"></span>[1](#fn_958.md) be spilt, let him pour
water thereon--everything here being pervaded (or obtained) by
water--for the obtainment of everything <span
id="fr_965"></span>[2](#fn_959.md); with a verse to Vish*n*u and
Varu*n*a,--for whatsoever distress one undergoes here on earth, all that
Varu*n*a inflicts <span id="fr_966"></span>[3](#fn_960.md),--(Vâ*g*. S.
VIII, 59; Atharva-veda VII, 25, 1),

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'They by whose
vigour the spheres were propped up, who are in strength the strongest
and mightiest; who sway with powers unresisted, to Vish*n*u and Varu*n*a
hath it gone at the morning prayer!' For Vish*n*u is the sacrifice, and
it is that (sacrifice) of his which now undergoes distress; and Varu*n*a
is the inflicter: thus by both these deities--that whose (sacrifice)
undergoes distress, and that which inflicts it--he heals (the joint of
the sacrifice), by both he puts it together.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:7:8">4:5:7:8</span></span>8. And
let him then touch (the spilt material) with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 60), 'To
the gods, to the sky hath the sacrifice gone: may wealth thence accrue
to me! to the men, to the air hath the sacrifice gone: may wealth thence
accrue to me! to the Fathers, to the earth hath the sacrifice gone: may
wealth thence accrue to me!'--'To whatever world the sacrifice has gone,
thence happiness has come to me <span id="fr_967"></span>[1](#fn_961.md)!'
this is what he thereby means to say.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:7:9">4:5:7:9</span></span>9. Here
now Âru*n*i said, 'Why should he sacrifice who would think himself the
worse for a miscarriage of the sacrifice? I, for one, am the better for
a miscarriage of the sacrifice <span id="fr_968"></span>[2](#fn_962.md)!'
This, then, he said with reference to the adoption of those
benedictions.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_953"></span>[411:1](sbe2666.htm#fr_959.md) Viz. the formulas,
Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 54-58, employed for making good any mishaps during the
Soma-sacrifice. Cf. *S*at. Br. XII, 6, 1, 1 seq. In the Kâ*n*va
recension, V, 7, 4, ka*nd*ikâs 5-10 correspond to the present
Brâhma*n*a, while ka*nd*ikâs 1-4 contain the account of the Mahâvratîya
graha corresponding to M. IV, 6, 4.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[411:2](sbe2666.htm#fr_960.md) ? Or, this then he
makes Pra*g*âpati to be; but see [IV, 6, 1, 5](sbe2670.htm#4:6:1:5.md).

<span id="fn_955"></span>[411:3](sbe2666.htm#fr_961.md) ? I.e. that divine
race or element. The Kâ*n*va text reads, etâvad vâ idam asty, etad dhy
am*ri*tam, yad dhy am*ri*ta*m* tad asti.

<span id="fn_956"></span>[411:4](sbe2666.htm#fr_962.md) See [p.
104](sbe2617.htm#page_104), note [3](sbe2618.htm#fn_272.md).

<span id="fn_957"></span>[411:5](sbe2666.htm#fr_963.md) That is, when they
milk the cow with the Mantras 'Flow thou <span id="page_412">p.
412</span> for the A*s*vins!' &c., see [IV, 2, 1,
11](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:11.md) seq. Perhaps yasyâ*m* velâyâm has to be taken
in the sense of 'at the same time at which they make it flow,' as is
done in the St. Petersb. Dict. Compare, however, the Kâ*n*va reading,
tad yâm upasa*m*krâmeyus tâm agre*n*a vâ dîkshita*s*âlâ*m* yatra vainam
etat pinvayanti tad enâm prâ*k*î*m* vodî*k*î*m* vâ sthâpayitavai brûyât.

<span id="fn_958"></span>[412:1](sbe2666.htm#fr_964.md) Viz. any Soma,
according to Kâty. XXV, 2, 9; or any clotted ghee (p*ri*shadâ*g*ya),
according to the Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_959"></span>[412:2](sbe2666.htm#fr_965.md) For this
construction, see [p. 15](sbe2605.htm#page_15.md), note
[3](sbe2605.htm#fn_55.md).

<span id="fn_960"></span>[412:3](sbe2666.htm#fr_966.md) Or, whatsoever
undergoes (suffering) here on earth, all that Varu*n*a causes to undergo
it.

<span id="fn_961"></span>[413:1](sbe2666.htm#fr_967.md) This last sentence
('To whatever world . . .') is treated as if it belonged to the
sacrificial formula, to which it is attached in the Sa*m*hitâ. The
mistake (which doubtless there is) probably arose from the omission of
the 'iti' in the Brâhma*n*a. In the Kâ*n*va text of the Brâhma*n*a, the
analogous sentence appears clearly as belonging to the exposition, and
not to the Sa*m*hitâ.

<span id="fn_962"></span>[413:2](sbe2666.htm#fr_968.md) Ki*m* sa ya*gñ*ena
ya*g*eteti yo ya*gñ*a*h* syât tena vy*ri*ddhena *s*reyo nâbhiga*kh*ed
iti. Kâ*n*va text.
