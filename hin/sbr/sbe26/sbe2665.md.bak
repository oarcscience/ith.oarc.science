### SIXTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:6:1">4:5:6:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati, forsooth, is that sacrifice which is here performed, and
whence these creatures have been produced, and in like manner are they
produced therefrom even to this day. Having drawn the A*s*vina graha, he
makes (the sacrificer) eye (the several cups, while muttering) the
Avakâ*s*a formulas <span id="fr_957"></span>[1](#fn_951.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:6:2">4:5:6:2</span></span>2. The
Upâ*ms*u cup he eyes first with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 27), 'For mine
out-breathing, (a) giver of lustre <span
id="fr_958"></span>[2](#fn_952.md), become thou pure for lustre!' Then the
Upâ*ms*usavana stone with, 'For my through-breathing, giver of lustre,
become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Antaryâma cup with, 'For mine
up-breathing, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the
Aindravâyava with, 'For my voice, giver of lustre, become thou pure for
lustre!' Then the Maitrâvaru*n*a with, 'For mine intelligence and will,
giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the A*s*vina with,
'For mine ear, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the
*S*u*k*ra and Manthin with, 'For mine eyes, givers of lustre, become ye
pure for lustre!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:6:3">4:5:6:3</span></span>3. Then
the Âgraya*n*a with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 28), 'For my mind, giver of lustre,
become thou -pure for lustre!' Then the Ukthya with, 'For

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

my vigour, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the
Dhruva with, 'For my life, giver of lustre, become thou pure for
lustre!' Then the two Soma-troughs (Pûtabh*ri*t and Âdhavanîya) with,
'For all mine offspring, givers of lustre, become ye pure for lustre!'
Now the two troughs belong to the All-gods, for therefrom they draw
(Soma) for the gods, therefrom for men, therefrom for the Fathers:
therefore the two Soma-troughs belong to the All-gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:6:4">4:5:6:4</span></span>4. Then
the Dro*n*akala*s*a with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 29), 'Who (ka) art thou? Which
one art thou?'--Ka is Pra*g*âpati;--'Whose (kasya, or Ka's) art thou?
who (ka) art thou by name?'--Ka ('who') by name is Pra*g*âpati;--'Thou
upon whose name we have thought,' for he indeed thinks upon his
name;--'Thou whom we have gladdened with Soma;'--for he indeed gladdens
him with Soma. Having drawn the Â*s*vina cup, he prays for blessing part
after part (of the sacrifice) with, 'May I be abundantly supplied with
offspring,' thereby he prays for offspring;--'abundantly supplied with
men,' thereby he prays for men (heroes);--'abundantly supplied with
food!' thereby he prays for prosperity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:6:5">4:5:6:5</span></span>5. He
must not let every one eye them, but only him who is well known, or one
who is his friend, or one who, being learned in sacred lore, may acquire
these (texts) through study. Having drawn the Â*s*vina cup, he (thus)
produces the whole sacrifice; and having produced the whole sacrifice,
he deposits it in his own self, and makes it his own.
