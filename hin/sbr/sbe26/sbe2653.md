### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:1">4:3:4:1</span></span>1. Now,
they slay the sacrifice, when they spread (perform) it:--to wit, when
they press out the king (Soma), they slay him; when they quiet the
victim, they slay it; and with mortar and pestle, with the upper and
nether millstone, they slay the havis offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:2">4:3:4:2</span></span>2. When
slain, that sacrifice was no longer vigorous. By means of dakshi*n*âs
(gifts to the priests) the gods invigorated it: hence the name
dakshi*n*â, because thereby they invigorated (dakshay) it. Whatever,
therefore, fails in this sacrifice, when slain, that he now invigorates
by means of gifts to the priests; then the sacrifice becomes indeed
successful: for this reason he makes gifts to the priests.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:3">4:3:4:3</span></span>3. Now at
the Havirya*gñ*a, indeed, they give as little as six or twelve
(cows <span id="fr_805"></span>[1](#fn_802).md), but no Soma-sacrifice
should have dakshi*n*âs of less than a hundred. For

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

he, Pra*g*âpati <span id="fr_806"></span>[1](#fn_803.md), forsooth, is the
visible sacrifice; and man is nearest to Pra*g*âpati, and he has a life
of a hundred years, a hundred powers, a hundred energies. Only by a
hundred he invigorates him, and not by less than a hundred: wherefore no
Soma-sacrifice should have dakshi*n*âs of less than a hundred; nor
should any one officiate as a priest for a sacrificer at a
(Soma-sacrifice) where less than a hundred are given,--'lest he should
be an eyewitness when they will but slay and not invigorate him (Soma).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:4">4:3:4:4</span></span>4. Now,
truly, there are two kinds of gods; for the gods, forsooth, are the
gods; and the learned Brâhmans versed in sacred lore are the human gods.
And the sacrifice to them is twofold, oblations (being the sacrifice) to
the gods, and gifts to the priests being that to the human gods, to the
learned Brâhmans versed in sacred lore. With oblations, forsooth, one
gratifies the gods, and with gifts to the priests the human gods, the
learned Brâhmans versed in sacred lore. These two kinds of gods, when
gratified, convey him to the heavenly world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:5">4:3:4:5</span></span>5. But it
is to the officiating priests, forsooth, that these gifts of his belong,
for they prepare him another self,--to wit, this sacrifice, consisting
of *Rik* and Ya*g*us and Sâman and oblations,--that becomes his self in
yonder world: 'It is they that have generated me,' from this
(consideration) he should give the gifts to officiating priests and not
to non-officiating.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:6">4:3:4:6</span></span>6. Having
gone back to the Gârhapatya fire <span id="fr_807"></span>[2](#fn_804.md),
he

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

offers the gift offerings. Having tied a piece of gold in a fringed
cloth <span id="fr_808"></span>[1](#fn_805.md), and laid it (into the
spoon), he offers. 'May there be a place for me in the world of the
gods!' With this hope he offers whoever offers: that same sacrifice of
his goes to the world of the gods; and behind it goes the gift he gives
to the priests, and holding on to the gift follows the sacrificer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:7">4:3:4:7</span></span>7. Now,
there are four (kinds of) gifts to priests,--gold, the cow, cloth, and
the horse. But it is not proper that he should lay a horse's foot or a
cow's foot (into the spoon): hence he ties up a piece of gold in a
fringed cloth, and having laid it (into the spoon) he offers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:8">4:3:4:8</span></span>8. He
offers with two verses to the Sun. For yonder world is shut off by
darkness; and dispelling the darkness by that light he reaches the
heavenly world: therefore he offers with two verses to the Sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:9">4:3:4:9</span></span>9. He
offers with this gâyatrî verse (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 41; Rig-veda I, 50, 1),
'The lights bear on high that divine knower of beings, Sûrya, that all
may see him,--Hail!'--for the gâyatrî is this earth, and she is a safe
resting-place hence he thereby stands firmly on this safe resting-place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:10">4:3:4:10</span></span>10. He
then makes the second offering with this trish*t*ubh verse (Vâ*g*. S.
VII, 42; Rig-veda I, 115, I), 'The brilliant front <span
id="fr_809"></span>[2](#fn_806.md) of the gods hath risen,

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

the eye of Mitra, Varu*n*a, and Agni: Sûrya, the soul of the movable and
immovable, hath filled the heaven and the earth and the air,--Hail!'
whereby he approaches the world (of the gods).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:11">4:3:4:11</span></span>11. He
then makes either one or two oblations on the Âgnîdhra (fire). The
reason why he makes one or two oblations on the Âgnîdhra fire is that
Agni rules over beasts (cattle) <span id="fr_810"></span>[1](#fn_807.md),
and they lie round about him on every side: it is him he pleases by this
oblation, and thus pleased he is gracious unto this (sacrificer), and
the latter offers (to the priests a cow) graciously given up by him
(Agni).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:12">4:3:4:12</span></span>12. He
offers with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 43; Rig-veda I, 189, 1), 'O Agni, lead us on
a good path unto wealth; thou, O god, that knowest all works! keep thou
from us the sin that leadeth astray, and we will offer unto thee most
ample adoration,'--'Hail!' Thereupon, if he intends to give away a
horse, harnessed or unharnessed, let him make a second oblation; but if
not, he need not attend to this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:13">4:3:4:13</span></span>13. He
offers with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 44), 'May this Agni make wide room for us:
may he march in front smiting the haters! May he gain riches in the
winning of riches: may he, fiercely rushing, conquer the enemies! Hail!'
for the horse is a winner of riches (spoils, prizes).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:14">4:3:4:14</span></span>14.
Thereupon, taking some gold, (the sacrificer)

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

goes to the hall. South of the altar stand the Dakshi*n*â (cows).
Standing in front of the hall, he respectfully addresses them <span
id="fr_811"></span>[1](#fn_808) with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 45.md), 'By your
beauty have I come to beauty.' Now at first cattle did not submit to
being given away. Laying aside their own beauteous forms <span
id="fr_812"></span>[2](#fn_809) they approached with their (bare.md)
bodies. The gods then went up to them from the offering ground with
their (the animals’) own forms; and they, knowing their own forms,
resigned themselves and became well-disposed to being given away. And in
like manner does he now go up to them from the offering ground with
their own forms; and they, knowing their own forms, resign themselves
and become well-disposed to being given away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:15">4:3:4:15</span></span>15.
'May the all-knowing Tutha distribute you!'--Now, Tutha is the Brahman:
he thus distributes them by means of the Brahman. And the Brahman knows
who is fit to receive a dakshi*n*â and who is unfit: thus these (cows)
of his are given away only to him who is fit to receive a dakshi*n*â and
not to him who is unfit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:16">4:3:4:16</span></span>16. 'Go
ye forward in the way of truth,'--for whosoever walks in the way of the
gods, walks in the way of truth;--'ye of shining (*k*andra) gifts!'
whereby they walk with that light (*k*andra, the moon).

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:17">4:3:4:17</span></span>17. He
then goes to the Sadas, saying, 'Behold thou the heaven, behold the
air!' whereby he means to say, 'May I through thee, the dakshi*n*â, see
the (heavenly) world.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:18">4:3:4:18</span></span>18.
Thereupon he looks on the Sadas, with, 'Unite with the Sadas-priests!'
whereby he means to say, 'May the Sadas-priests not go beyond thee!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:19">4:3:4:19</span></span>19. He
then takes the gold and goes up to the Âgnîdhra (fire-house), saying
(Vâ*g*. S. VII, 46), 'May I this day obtain a Brâhman who has a father
and forefathers!'--for he who is renowned and of renowned family, is one
who has a father and forefathers; and by the gifts which he gives to a
renowned (priest), though they be but few, he gains great things.--'A
*Ri*shi, the scion of *Ri*shis,' for he who is renowned as learned in
sacred lore, is a *Ri*shi, the scion of *Ri*shis;--'of well-bestowed
gifts,' for he indeed is one on whom gifts are well-bestowed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:20">4:3:4:20</span></span>20.
Having thus respectfully sat down by the Agnîdh, he gives him the gold,
with 'Given (râta) by us, go ye to the gods!'--for whatever sacrificial
gift he gives unhesitatingly, with a liberal (râta) mind, thereby he
gains great things, 'Go ye to the gods,' he says, for he who sacrifices,
sacrifices with the hope, 'May there be a place for me in the world of
the gods;' and he thus makes him a sharer in the world of the
gods.--'Enter ye to the Giver!' whereby he means to say, 'Enter ye into
me!' and thus those (cows) <span id="fr_813"></span>[1](#fn_810.md) do not
get lost to him. And as to his giving

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

a dakshi*n*â first to the Agnîdh, it was from thence (from the
Âgnîdhra) <span id="fr_814"></span>[1](#fn_811.md) that all the gods gained
immortality: therefore he gives the dakshi*n*â first to the Agnîdh.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:21">4:3:4:21</span></span>21.
Then, approaching in the same way, he gives some gold to an Âtreya <span
id="fr_815"></span>[2](#fn_812.md). For, at the time <span
id="fr_816"></span>[3](#fn_813.md) when they recite the morning prayer,
they were once upon a time singing praises here in front <span
id="fr_817"></span>[4](#fn_814.md). Now Atri was the Hot*ri* of the
*Ri*shis. Then the darkness of the Asuras came rushing into the Sadas.
The *Ri*shis said to Atri, 'Come back here, and dispel this darkness!'
He dispelled that darkness; and thinking, 'He indeed is the light who
has dispelled this darkness,' they brought him this light, gold, for a
sacrificial gift,--for gold is indeed light; and by that same splendour
and energy the *Ri*shi dispelled the darkness. And so does he now also
dispel the darkness by that light: therefore he bestows gold on an
Âtreya.

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:22">4:3:4:22</span></span>22.
Then to the Brahman, for the Brahman watches over the sacrifice from the
south. Then to the Udgât*ri* (chanter); then to the Hot*ri*; then to the
two Adhvaryus, seated in the cart-shed. Then, having returned (to the
Sadas he presents gold) to the Prastot*ri*; then to the Maitrâvaru*n*a;
then to the Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin; then to the Pot*ri*; then to the
Nesh*tri*; then to the A*kh*âvâka; then to the Unnet*ri*; then to the
Grâvastut; then to the Subrahma*n*yâ. To the Pratihart*ri* he presents
it last, since he is the restrainer(pratihart*ri*) <span
id="fr_818"></span>[1](#fn_815): he thus in the end restrains (the cows.md)
for him, and so they do not become lost to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:23">4:3:4:23</span></span>23.
Thereupon he (the Adhvaryu) says (to the Maitrâvaru*n*a), 'Recite (the
invitatory prayer) to Indra, followed by the Maruts!' Now when, in the
beginning, Pra*g*âpati gave gifts, Indra thought within himself,
'Everything here, forsooth, he will give away, and not anything will he
leave for us.' He then, to stop the giving, raised up that thunderbolt
'Recite to Indra Marutvat!' and thereafter he (Pra*g*âpati) gave no
more. And in like manner is that thunderbolt 'Recite to Indra Marutvat!'
now raised up to stop the giving, and thereafter he (the sacrificer)
gives no more.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:24">4:3:4:24</span></span>24;
There are, then, four (kinds of) sacrificial gifts: Gold--thereby indeed
he preserves his own life, for gold is life. That he (Pra*g*âpati or
Varu*n*a) gave

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

to Agni, performing the office of the Agnîdh (fire-kindler): wherefore
now also gold is given to the Agnîdh.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:25">4:3:4:25</span></span>25.
Then the Cow--thereby he preserves his own breath, for the cow is
breath, since the cow is food, and breath also is food: her he gave to
Rudra, the Hot*ri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:26">4:3:4:26</span></span>26.
Then Cloth--thereby he preserves his own skin, for the cloth is skin:
this he gave to B*ri*haspati, who chanted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:27">4:3:4:27</span></span>27.
Then the Horse--for the horse is a thunderbolt: he thereby makes the
thunderbolt the leader. And, moreover, he who sacrifices, sacrifices
with the hope 'May there be a place for me in Yama's world!' He thus
makes him a sharer in Yama's world. This he gave to Yama, the Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:28">4:3:4:28</span></span>28. The
(proffered) gold he (the Adhvaryu) goes to meet (accepts) with (Vâ*g*.
S. VII, 47), 'Let Varu*n*a give thee to me (who am) Agni!' for to Agni
Varu*n*a gave it. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou life to the giver,
joy (mayas) to me, the receiver!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:29">4:3:4:29</span></span>29. And
the cow he accepts with, 'Let Varu*n*a give thee to me, Rudra!' for to
Rudra Varu*n*a gave her. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou breath to
the giver, strength (vayas) to me, the receiver!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:30">4:3:4:30</span></span>30. And
the cloth he accepts with, 'Let Varu*n*a give thee to me, B*ri*haspati!'
for to B*ri*haspati Varu*n*a gave it. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou
a skin to the giver, joy to me, the receiver!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:31">4:3:4:31</span></span>31. And
the horse he accepts with, 'Let Varu*n*a give thee to me, Yama!' for to
Yama Varu*n*a

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

gave it. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou a steed (haya*h*) to the
giver, strength (vayas) to me, the receiver!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:32">4:3:4:32</span></span>32. And
whatever other gift he gives that he gives with the hope, 'May I also
have this in yonder world!' That he accepts with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 48),
'Who hath given it? to whom hath he given it? Hope hath given it, for
Hope hath he given it: Hope is the giver, Hope the receiver. This to
thee, O Hope!' Thus he assigns it to a deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:3:4:33">4:3:4:33</span></span>33.
Here they say <span id="fr_819"></span>[1](#fn_816.md),--Let him not assign
it to any deity; for whatsoever deity he here kindles, that deity, being
kindled, becomes ever more glorious from one day to the morrow; and to
whatever fire he here adds fuel, that fire, being kindled, becomes ever
more glorious from one day to the morrow; and ever more glorious does he
become, whosoever, knowing this, accepts (a gift): even as one offers in
kindled fire, so does he offer that (gift) which he gives to one learned
in the scriptures. Therefore he who is learned in the scriptures need
not assign (the gift to a deity).

usurpation, on the part of Agni, of one of Rudra's functions, Sâya*n*a
refers to a legend in the Taittirîyaka (Taitt. S. I, 5, 1), where Agni
is identified with Rudra, Agni being so called because he roared (rud).
See also *S*at. Br, I, 7, 3, 8.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[344:1](sbe2653.htm#fr_811.md) The cows are driven
past him along the back of the altar, between the hall and Sadas, and
then along the north side of the altar, south of the Âgnîdhra and
between the pit (*k*âtvâla) and heap of rubbish (utkara), the sacrificer
following them as far as the Âgnîdhra. At the same time the
Subrahma*n*yâ litany (see [III, 3, 4, 17](sbe2614.htm#3:3:4:17) seq..md)
may be recited.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[344:2](sbe2653.htm#fr_812.md) Sâya*n*a explains

<span id="fn_810"></span>[345:1](sbe2653.htm#fr_813.md) The cows (and other
gifts) are presented at the same time. viz. either a hundred to each
officiating priest, or to each his proportionate share of an aggregate
of a hundred cows, viz. twelve cows <span id="page_346">p. 346</span> to
each of the first four priests, six to each of the second four
(Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin, &c., see § 22), four to each of the third four,
and three cows to each of the remaining four priests.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[346:1](sbe2653.htm#fr_814.md) See [III, 6, 1,
27](sbe2623.htm#3:6:1:27)-[28](sbe2623.htm#3:6:1:28.md).

<span id="fn_812"></span>[346:2](sbe2653.htm#fr_815.md) That is, one of
Âtreya descent, who does not officiate as a priest, and who is seated in
front of the Sadas. According to the Kâ*n*va text (and Kâty. X, 2, 21)
the Adhvaryu approaches him with 'Ka Âtreyam'--who (? sees) the
Âtreya?--thrice repeated. Kâtyâyana specifies some subdivision of the
(female line of) the Âtreya race--also mentioned in the same order in
the Pravarâdhyâya--as excluded from this privilege. On this legend cf.
V, 3, 2, 2; Taitt. S. II, i, 2, 2; Tâ*nd*ya Br. VI, 6, 8; Ind. Stud.
III, p. 464.

<span id="fn_813"></span>[346:3](sbe2653.htm#fr_816.md) Viz. early in the
morning of the sutyâ day, when the Prâtar-anuvâka is recited. See [p.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[346:4](sbe2653.htm#fr_817.md) I take 'purâ' in
the sense of 'in front' (cf. [III, 9, 1, 12](sbe2636.htm#3:9:1:12).md),
that in the havirdhâna shed, and not in that of 'formerly' (Ind. Stud.
X, 558). The Kâ*n*va text brings out the meaning still more clearly: Sa
yad âtreyâya hira*n*ya*m* dadâty, atrir hi vâ *ri*shî*n*â*m* hotâ sa
yatro <span id="page_347">p. 347</span> ha vâ ada âsîna*h*

âhavanîyasya samîpe.'

<span id="fn_815"></span>[347:1](sbe2653.htm#fr_818.md) For the part taken
by the Pratihart*ri* in the chanting of stotras, see [p.
310](sbe2649.htm#page_310), note [1](sbe2649.htm#fn_747.md).

<span id="fn_816"></span>[349:1](sbe2653.htm#fr_819.md) The Kâ*n*va text of
this paragraph seems more correct: Thus he assigns it to deities; for
when he bestows (abhyâdhâ) anything on a deity, that deity thereby
shines ever more brilliantly; and whatever (fuel) he adds to the fire,
thereby it shines ever more brilliantly: and more glorious does he
become from day to day whosoever, knowing it, accepts it thus. Here now
Âsuri said, 'But he who is learned in the scriptures need not regard
this; for as one puts fuel on kindled fire, and offers on kindled fire,
thus he gives who gives gifts to one learned in the scriptures.'
