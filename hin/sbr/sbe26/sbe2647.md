### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:1">4:2:3:1</span></span>1. That
Ukthya (graha), forsooth, is his undefined breath (vital air) <span
id="fr_706"></span>[2](#fn_704), and as such it is that self of his; for
the undefined breath is the self; it is his

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

vital energy. Hence he draws it by means of this (earth), because of her
is the bowl, and he draws it with a bowl;--for undecaying and immortal
is this (earth), and undecaying and immortal is the vital energy;
therefore he draws it by means of this (earth or bowl).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:2">4:2:3:2</span></span>2. He
draws it full; for full means all, and the vital energy means all:
therefore he draws it full.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:3">4:2:3:3</span></span>3. That
Dhruva (graha) <span id="fr_707"></span>[1](#fn_705), forsooth, (also)
is his vital energy; by it his body is held together, and the joints are
knit together. For (when) the last cup has not yet been drawn from that
(Soma juice in the Ukthya vessel) for the A*kh*âvâka priest,

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:4">4:2:3:4</span></span>4. Then
he takes the king (Soma) down (from the cart) <span
id="fr_708"></span>[2](#fn_706), and pours one third of the Vasatîvarîs
(into the Âdhavanîya trough). Thus the joint unites; for, indeed, he
makes (the Ukthya cup) the first of the second pressing (Soma feast),
and the last of the first: that which belongs to the second pressing he
makes first, and that which belongs to the first he makes last. Thus he
interlocks them; whence these joints are interlocked: this one
overlapping thus, and this one thus.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:5">4:2:3:5</span></span>5. In
like manner at the midday pressing: (when)

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

the last cup has not yet been drawn therefrom for the A*kh*âvâka priest,
he pours (the remaining) one-third of the Vasatîvarî (into the
Âdhavanîya). Thus the joint unites; for, indeed, he makes it the first
of the second pressing, and the last of the first pressing <span
id="fr_709"></span>[1](#fn_707): that which belongs to the second
pressing he makes first, and that which belongs to the first he makes
last. Thus he interlocks them; whence these joints are interlocked: this
one overlapping thus, and this one thus. And because his body is thereby
held together, therefore this (graha) is his vital energy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:6">4:2:3:6</span></span>6. This
(Ukthya graha) is the cow of plenty, Indra's special portion. At the
morning feast he (the Adhvaryu) divides it for three songs of
praise <span id="fr_710"></span>[2](#fn_708), and at the midday feast
for three,--this makes six times, for there are six seasons, and the
seasons mature all wishes here on earth: for this reason, then, this
(libation) is the cow of plenty, Indra's special portion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:7">4:2:3:7</span></span>7. He
draws it without (reciting) a puroru*k*; for the puroru*k* is a song of
praise, since the puroru*k* is a *Rik*, and the song of praise is *Rik*;
and the libation is Sâman; and what other (formula) he mutters, that is
Ya*g*us. Formerly these same (puroru*k* verses) were apart <span
id="fr_711"></span>[3](#fn_709) from the *Rik*s, apart from the Ya*g*us,
and apart from the Sâmans.

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:8">4:2:3:8</span></span>8. The
gods said, 'Come, let us place them among the Ya*g*us: thus this science
will be still more manifold.' Accordingly they placed them among the
Ya*g*us, and thenceforward this science was still more manifold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:9">4:2:3:9</span></span>9. And
the reason why he draws this (graha) without a puroru*k*, is that the
puroru*k* is praise, (being) a *Rik*, and the song of praise is *Rik*;
and in that he divides it for recitations, thereby indeed it becomes
possessed of a puroru*k*: hence he draws it without a puroru*k*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:10">4:2:3:10</span></span>10. Now
he draws it from that (stream of Soma <span
id="fr_712"></span>[1](#fn_710)), with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 22), 'Thou art
taken with a support: thee for Indra, possessed of the great (chant),
possessed of vigour,'--for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice;
wherefore he says 'thee for Indra;' and by 'possessed of the great
(chant), possessed of vigour,' he means to say 'for him, the
strong;'--'I take (thee) the song-pleasing,' for he indeed takes it for
songs of praise;--'what great vigour is thine, O Indra'--whereby he
means to say, 'what strength is thine, O Indra'--'for that (I take)
thee! for Vish*n*u--thee!' for he takes it for the life of the
sacrifice: hence he says, 'for that--thee! for Vish*n*u--thee!' With,
'This is thy womb: thee for the songs of praise!' he deposits it; for he
indeed takes it for songs of praise.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:11">4:2:3:11</span></span>11. He
distributes it <span id="fr_713"></span>[2](#fn_711) with, 'Thee, the

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

god-pleasing <span id="fr_714"></span>[1](#fn_712), I take for the gods,
for the life of the sacrifice.' He who would perform it in this manner
would assume the command <span id="fr_715"></span>[2](#fn_713); but let
him rather distribute it to the respective deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:12">4:2:3:12</span></span>12.
With, 'Thee, the god-pleasing, I take for Mitra and Varu*n*a, for the
life of the sacrifice!' (he takes the portion) for the Maitrâvaru*n*a
priest;--for in verses to Mitra and Varu*n*a they (the Udgât*ri*s) chant
praises for this (libation); and he (the Hot*ri*) afterwards recites
verses to Mitra and Varu*n*a for the *s*astra, and offers with a verse
to Mitra and Varu*n*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:13">4:2:3:13</span></span>13.
With, 'Thee, the god-pleasing, I take for Indra, for the life of the
sacrifice!' (he takes the portion) for the Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin; for in
verses to Indra praises are chanted for this (libation); and verses to
Indra are afterwards recited as a *s*astra, and offering is made with a
verse to Indra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:14">4:2:3:14</span></span>14.
With, 'Thee, the god-pleasing, I take for Indra and Agni, for the life
of the sacrifice!' (he takes the portion) for the A*kh*âvâka; for in
verses to Indra and Agni praises are chanted for this (libation); and
verses to Indra and Agni are afterwards recited as a *s*astra, and
offering is made

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

with a verse to Indra and Agni. With, 'Thee . . . . for Indra,' he
performs at the midday feast, for the midday feast is sacred to Indra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:15">4:2:3:15</span></span>15. Now
the *K*arakâdhvaryus <span id="fr_716"></span>[1](#fn_714) divide (the
Ukthya libation into three portions), with 'Thou art taken with a
support: thee, the god-pleasing, I take for the gods; (thee) the
praise-pleasing, for praises, agreeable to Mitra and Varu*n*a!'--with
'This is thy womb: thee to Mitra and Varu*n*a!' he (the *K*arakâdhvaryu)
deposits it; and with 'Thou art a re-offering' he touches the sthâlî.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:16">4:2:3:16</span></span>16.
'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing. I take for the
gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises,--agreeable to
Indra!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra!' thus he deposits it; and with
'Thou art a re-offering' he touches the sthâlî.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:17">4:2:3:17</span></span>17.
'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing, I take for the
gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises,--agreeable to Indra and
Agni!--This is thy womb: thee for Indra and Agni!' thus he deposits it.
He does not at this (third portion) touch the sthâlî with 'Thou art a
re-offering.' '. . . . Thee for Indra!' he says each time at the midday
feast, for the midday feast is sacred to Indra.

Twice he touches the sthâlî with 'Thou art a re-offering;' and silently
he puts it down the third time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:3:18">4:2:3:18</span></span>18.
But, in order to avoid sameness (of performance), let him not take it
out with the 'support;' nor let him deposit it in the 'womb;' for this
(Ukthya

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

libation) has at first been taken with the 'support,' and it has at
first been deposited in the womb;--and were he now also to take it with
the 'support,' and deposit it in the 'womb,' he would assuredly commit
(the fault of) sameness. And as to his touching the sthâlî with 'Thou
art a re-offering,' he will indeed again take a libation therefrom. Let
him not heed this, but let him put down (the vessel) silently.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_704"></span>[292:2](sbe2647.htm#fr_706) We ought doubtless,
with the Kâ*n*va text, to read 'prâ*n*a*h*' instead of 'âtmâ.'

<span id="fn_705"></span>[293:1](sbe2647.htm#fr_707) See IV, 2, 4, 1
seq.

<span id="fn_706"></span>[293:2](sbe2647.htm#fr_708) At the end of the
morning feast the Soma in the Ukthya bowl (sthâlî) is poured into the
Ukthya cup (pâtra) in three portions; and part of each having been
offered, the remaining juice is drunk by the Hot*ri*'s assistants, viz.
the Pra*s*âst*ri*, Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin, and A*kh*âvaka. Each of these
potations is preceded by the chanting of an â*g*ya-stotra, and the
recitation of the â*g*ya-*s*astra (see next page, note [2](#fn_708)).
But before the portion of the last-named priest is poured into his cup
(*k*amasa), fresh Soma-plants are taken down from the cart for the
midday pressing; one half of the remaining Vasatîvarî water (or one
third of the original quantity) being also poured into the Âdhavanîya
trough. See [III, 9, 2, 3](sbe2637.htm#3:9:2:3).

<span id="fn_707"></span>[294:1](sbe2647.htm#fr_709) That is to say, the
last (thing) of the first of the last two pressings, or of the midday
pressing.

<span id="fn_708"></span>[294:2](sbe2647.htm#fr_710) Uktha, lit.
'recitation,' is the old term for 'sastra' ([IV, 3, 2,
1](sbe2651.htm#4:3:2:1) seq.). Regarding the three *s*astras of the
Hotrakas, for the recitation of which the Ukthya graha is divided
between those priests, see notes on [IV, 3, 1,
25](sbe2650.htm#4:3:1:25); [3, 3, 19](sbe2652.htm#4:3:3:19).

<span id="fn_709"></span>[294:3](sbe2647.htm#fr_711) The Kâ*n*va text
reads thrice 'abhyardhe.' Regarding the puroru*k* formulas see [p.
268](sbe2642.htm#page_268), note [1](sbe2642.htm#fn_643).

<span id="fn_710"></span>[295:1](sbe2647.htm#fr_712) See [p.
256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note [1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619).

<span id="fn_711"></span>[295:2](sbe2647.htm#fr_713) That is, he pours,
for each of the three assistant priests, his respective portion into the
Ukthya-pâtra. This distribution does not however take place till the end
of the morning performance; see note to [IV, 2, 2,
4](sbe2646.htm#4:2:2:4); [3, 1, 25](sbe2650.htm#4:3:1:25).

<span id="fn_712"></span>[296:1](sbe2647.htm#fr_714) Or, the
god-prospering (i.e. the one prospering the gods), devâvî.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[296:2](sbe2647.htm#fr_715) Pra*s*âsana*m*
kuryât. The same phrase occurs I, 9, I, 24, where I translated 'will
ensure dominion,'--probably wrongly, though I am by no means sure of the
correct meaning. Sâya*n*a there seems to take it in the sense of 'he
bids (the gods grant his request), thus having chiefly his own interest
in view'--'pra*s*âsyante ’to devâ*h* prârthyamânâ iti pra*s*âsanam
parusha*m* syât sâkshât svârthaparatva*m* kuryâd ity artha*h*.' The
Kâ*n*va text reads, 'let him not divide (the libation) with this
(formula), for he who divides it thus--pra*s*âsana*m* kuryât.' Perhaps
he means to say, that by using that formula one would put oneself above
the gods. At I, 9, 1, 14 'one would give orders (to the gods)' is
probably the right translation.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[297:1](sbe2647.htm#fr_716) Such is the rule
(sthiti); but the Karakâdhvaryus divide it in this way.' Kâ*n*va text.
The formulas of the Taitt. S. I, 4, 12, and Maitrây. S. I, 3, 14, differ
from the above; perhaps the Kâ*th*aka is referred to; see v. Schroeder,
M. S. I, p. 36, note 3.
