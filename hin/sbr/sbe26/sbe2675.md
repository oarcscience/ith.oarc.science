### SIXTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:6:1">4:6:6:1</span></span>1. Now
once on a time the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an
attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They said, 'Who of us shall sit on the
south side; we will then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a
place free from danger and injury.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:6:2">4:6:6:2</span></span>2. They
said, 'He who is the strongest of us, let him sit on the south side; we
will then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free
from danger and injury.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:6:3">4:6:6:3</span></span>3. They
said, 'Verily, Indra is the strongest of us: let Indra sit on the south
side; we will then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place
free from danger and injury.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:6:4">4:6:6:4</span></span>4. They
said to Indra, 'Verily, thou art the strongest of us: sit thou on the
south side; we will then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a
place free from danger and injury.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:6:5">4:6:6:5</span></span>5. He
said, 'What will be my reward then?'--'The office of
Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin shall be thine, the

<span id="page_434">p. 434</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brahmasâman <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[1](#fn_1006) shall be thine!'--Hence one elects the
Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin with, 'Indra is the Brahman, by virtue of the
Brahmaship!' for to Indra belongs this (office). Indra sat on the south
side, and they entered upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place
free from danger and injury. Therefore let him who is the strongest sit
on the south side, and let them then enter upon the sacrifice on the
north side in a place free from danger and injury. Now he, forsooth, who
is the most learned of Brâhmans, is the strongest of them; and as now
any one is (able to become) a (superintendent) Brahman <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[2](#fn_1007)--nay, does he not sit
still?--therefore whosoever is the strongest

<span id="page_435">p. 435</span>

of them, let him sit on the south side, and let them then enter upon the
sacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury.
Hence Brâhmans sit on the south side (of the vedi), and they enter upon
the sacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:6:6">4:6:6:6</span></span>6. When
(the Prastot*ri*) says, 'Brahman, we will chant, O Pra*s*âstar!' then
the Brahman mutters (Vâ*g*.. S. II, 12), 'This thy sacrifice, O divine
Savitar, have they announced unto B*ri*haspati (the lord of prayer), the
Brahman <span id="fr_1014"></span>[1](#fn_1008): therefore speed the
sacrifice, speed the lord of the sacrifice, speed me <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[2](#fn_1009)!--Praise ye at the impulse (prasava)
of Savit*ri*!' The significance is the same (as before) <span
id="fr_1016"></span>[3](#fn_1010). With this (text) must probably enter
upon (the chant).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:6:7">4:6:6:7</span></span>7. But
one may also enter upon it with, 'O divine Savitar; this, O
B*ri*haspati, forwards!' Therewith he hastes to Savit*ri* for his
impulsion, for he is the impeller (prasavit*ri*) of the gods; and 'O
B*ri*haspati, forwards!' he says, because B*ri*haspati is the Brahman of
the gods,--thus he announces it to him who is the Brahman of the gods:
therefore he says, 'O B*ri*haspati, forwards <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[4](#fn_1011)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:6:8">4:6:6:8</span></span>8. The
Maitrâvaru*n*a then mutters, 'Impelled

<span id="page_436">p. 436</span>

by the divine Savit*ri*, acceptable to Mitra and Varu*n*a!' Therewith he
hastes to Savit*ri* for his impulsion, for he is the impeller of the
gods; and 'acceptable to Mitra and Varu*n*a' he says, because Mitra and
Varu*n*a are the deities of the Maitrâvaru*n*a (Pra*s*âst*ri*),--thus he
announces it to those who are the deities of the Maitrâvaru*n*a:
therefore he says, 'acceptable to Mitra and Varu*n*a.'

<span id="fn_1006"></span>[434:1](sbe2675.htm#fr_1012) That is, the
Sâman which supplies the text for the Stotra chanted in connection with
the Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin's Sastra, and forming the Stotriya verse of
the latter. Thus, at the midday savana, the (P*ri*sh*th*a) Stotra of
that priest usually consists of the Naudhasa-sâman (Sâma-veda II,
35-36), if the Rathantara-sâman (Sâma-vela II, 30-31) is used for the
Hot*ri*'s Stotra; but, if the B*ri*hat-sâman (ib. II, 159-160) is used
for the latter, then the *S*yaita-sâman (II, 161-2) is used as the
Brahma-sâman. See [p. 339](sbe2652.htm#page_339), note
[2](sbe2652.htm#fn_801). The reason, however, why special mention is
made of the Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin in this place, probably is that at the
Gavâm ayana the Brahma-sâman is treated in a peculiar way. For, while on
142 days of the first half of the year,--viz. on the *K*aturvi*ms*a, on
all (6 × 23) Âbhiplavika days and on the three Svara-sâman days,--one
and the same tune, the Abhîvarta-sâman, is to be used day by day, but
each time with a different pragâtha stanza (thus the pragâtha S. V. II,
35-36, usually chanted to the Naudhasa tune, being on this occasion
chanted to the Abhîvarta tune); on the corresponding days of the second
half of the year, one and the same stanza, 'Indra kratu*m* na â bhara'
(S. V. II, 806-7), is to be used day by day, but with different tunes
(six such being given in the Calc. ed. vol. iv, pp. 529-34). Tâ*nd*ya
Br. IV, 3, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_1007"></span>[434:2](sbe2675.htm#fr_1013) According to XII,
6, I, 40 only priests of the Vasish*th*a family could become Brahmans,
or superintendent priests, in olden times; because they alone knew the
Somabhâga mantras; but now every one learns them, and can therefore
become a Brahman.

<span id="fn_1008"></span>[435:1](sbe2675.htm#fr_1014) Mahîdhara
interprets, 'This sacrifice, O divine Savitar, they announce to thee and
to B*ri*haspati, the Brahman.' Perhaps the correct meaning (though not
that assumed by the Brâhma*n*a) is, 'This sacrifice they announce to
thee as the B*ri*haspati, the Brahman!' and similarly the mantra in the
next paragraph.

<span id="fn_1009"></span>[435:2](sbe2675.htm#fr_1015) The Kâ*n*va text
adds here the verse Vâ*g*. S. II, 13; see *S*at. Br. I, 7, 4, 22, with
the same various reading 'gyotir.'
