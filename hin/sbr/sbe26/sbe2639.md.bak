### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### B. THE PRÂTA*H*SAVANA, OR MORNING-PRESSING.

##### 1. UPÂ*MS*U-GRAHA.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:1">3:9:4:1</span></span>1.
Thereupon they sit down round the two press-boards <span
id="fr_588"></span>[1](#fn_586). He (the Adhvaryu.md) then ties a piece of
gold to that (nameless finger). For twofold, verily, is this; there is
no third, namely, the truth and the untruth; the gods, forsooth, are the
truth, and men are the untruth. And the gold has sprung from Agni's
seed: 'With the truth I will touch the stalks, with the truth I will
take hold of Soma,' thus he thinks, and therefore he ties a piece of
gold to that (ring-finger).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:2">3:9:4:2</span></span>2. He
then takes a press-stone <span id="fr_589"></span>[2](#fn_587.md). Now
those

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

press-stones are of rock, and Soma is a god--for Soma was in the sky,
Soma was V*ri*tra; those mountains, those rocks are his body--he thus
perfects him by means of his body, makes him whole; therefore they are
of rock. Moreover, in pressing him they slay him, they slay him by means
of that (stone, Soma's own body); thus he rises from thence, thus he
lives; therefore the press-stones are of rock.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:3">3:9:4:3</span></span>3. He
takes it with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 30), 'At the impulse of the divine
Savit*ri* I take thee with the arms of the A*s*vins, with the hands of
Pûshan; thou art a giver!' For Savit*ri* is the impeller of the gods;
thus he takes it, impelled by Savit*ri*. 'With the arms of the
A*s*vins,' he says,--the A*s*vins are the Adhvaryus (of the gods): with
their arms he thus takes it, not with his own. 'With the hands of
Pûshan,' he says,--Pûshan is the distributor of portions: with his hands
he thus takes it, not with his own. Moreover, that (stone) is a
thunderbolt, and no man can hold it: by means of those deities he takes
it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:4">3:9:4:4</span></span>4. 'I
take thee: thou art a giver,' he says; for when they press him by means
of that (stone), then there is an oblation; and when he offers an
oblation, then he gives sacrificial gifts,--thus, then, that (stone)
gives twofold, oblations and sacrificial gifts; wherefore he says, 'Thou
art a giver.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:5">3:9:4:5</span></span>5.
'Perform thou this deep cult!' Cult means sacrifice; he thereby means to
say, 'Perform thou this great sacrifice!'--'well-gotten for Indra;' by
'well-gotten' he means to say, 'well-produced;' and Indra is the deity
of the sacrifice, wherefore he says, 'for Indra;'--'by the most
excellent bolt,'

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

for he, Soma, is indeed the most excellent bolt <span
id="fr_590"></span>[1](#fn_588.md), therefore he says, 'by the most
excellent bolt;'--'the (cult) rich in food and sweetness and drink,'
whereby he means to say, 'the (cult) rich in sap.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:6">3:9:4:6</span></span>6.
Thereupon he restrains-speech. For once on a time, the gods, while
performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas.
They said, 'Let us sacrifice in a low voice, let us restrain speech!'
They sacrificed (with formulas muttered) in a low voice and restrained
speech.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:7">3:9:4:7</span></span>7. He
then fetches the Nigrâbhyâs (waters), and makes him (the sacrificer)
mutter over them <span id="fr_591"></span>[2](#fn_589.md), 'Ye are the
Nigrâbhyâs, heard by the gods; satisfy me, satisfy my mind, satisfy my
speech, satisfy my breath, satisfy mine eye, satisfy mine ear, satisfy
my soul, satisfy mine offspring, satisfy my flocks, satisfy my
followers, let not my followers thirst!' For water is sap, and over it
he invokes this blessing, 'Satisfy ye my whole self, satisfy my
offspring, satisfy my followers, let not my followers thirst!' Now that
Upâ*ms*usavana (stone), forsooth, is in reality Âditya Vivasvant (the
sun), it is the pervading vital air (vyâna) of this (sacrifice).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:8">3:9:4:8</span></span>8.
Thereon he metes out (the Soma). For in pressing him they slay him, they
slay him by means of that (stone); thus <span
id="fr_592"></span>[3](#fn_590.md) he rises from hence, thus he

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

lives. And because he metes him out, therefore there is a measure,--both
the measure among men <span id="fr_593"></span>[1](#fn_591.md), and what
other measure there is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:9">3:9:4:9</span></span>9. He
metes out with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 32), 'Thee for Indra, with the Vasus, with
the Rudras!' For Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says,
'Thee for Indra;' and by saying 'with the Vasus, with the Rudras,' he
assigns a share, along with (or after) Indra, to the Vasus and the
Rudras.--'Thee for Indra, with the Âdityas!' whereby he assigns a share
to the Âdityas along with Indra.--'Thee for Indra, the slayer of foes!'
a foe is an enemy: 'Thee for Indra, the slayer of enemies,' he means to
say. This is his (Indra's) special share: as there is a special share
for a chief, so is this his special share apart from the (other) gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:10">3:9:4:10</span></span>10.
'Thee for the Soma-bearing falcon!' this he metes out for
Gâyatrî.--'Thee for Agni, the bestower of growth of wealth!' Now Agni is
Gâyatrî: he metes this out for Gâyatrî. And since Gâyatrî, as a falcon,
fetched Soma from heaven, therefore she is (called) the Soma-bearing
falcon: for that prowess of hers he metes out (for her) a second
portion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:11">3:9:4:11</span></span>11. Now
as to why he metes out five times <span
id="fr_594"></span>[2](#fn_592.md),--the sacrifice is of the same measure
as the year, and there are five seasons in the year: he takes possession
of it in five (divisions); hence he metes out five times.

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:12">3:9:4:12</span></span>12. He
touches it with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 33), 'What light of thine there is in the
heavens, O Soma, what on earth, and what in the wide air, therewith make
wide room for this sacrificer, for his prosperity: speak thou for the
giver!' Now when he (Soma) first became sacrificial food for the gods,
he thought within himself, 'I must not become sacrificial food for the
gods with my whole self!' Accordingly he deposited those three bodies of
his in these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:13">3:9:4:13</span></span>13. The
gods then were victorious. They obtained those bodies by means of this
same (formula), and he became entirely the sacrificial food of the gods.
And in like manner does this (priest) now thereby obtain those bodies of
his, and he (Soma) becomes entirely the food of the gods: this is why he
thus touches it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:14">3:9:4:14</span></span>14. He
then pours Nigrâbhyâ water on it. Now the waters, forsooth, slew
V*ri*tra and by virtue of that prowess of theirs they now flow.
Wherefore nothing whatsoever can check them when they flow; for they
followed their own free will, thinking, 'To whom, forsooth, should we
submit (or stop), we by whom V*ri*tra was slain!' Now all this
(universe), whatsoever there is, had submitted <span
id="fr_595"></span>[1](#fn_593.md) to Indra, even he that blows yonder.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:15">3:9:4:15</span></span>15.
Indra spake, 'Verily, all this (universe), whatsoever there is, has
submitted unto me: submit ye also to me!'--They said, 'What shall be our
(reward) then?'--'The first draught of king Soma shall be yours!'--'So
be it!' thus they submitted to

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

him; and they having submitted, he drew (ni-grabh) them to his breast;
and because he thus drew them to his breast, therefore they are called
Nigrâbhyâs. And in like manner does this sacrificer now draw them to his
breast: and this is their first draught of king Soma, in that he pours
Nigrâbhyâ water thereon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:16">3:9:4:16</span></span>16. He
pours it with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 34), 'Ye are grateful, the subduers of
V*ri*tra;'--the waters indeed are propitious: therefore he says, 'Ye are
grateful;' and 'the subduers of V*ri*tra' he says because they did slay
V*ri*tra;--'the beneficent wives of the immortal (Soma);' for the waters
are immortal;--'Ye goddesses, lead this sacrifice to the gods!' there is
nothing obscure in this; 'Invited, drink ye of Soma!' Thus invited they
drink the first draught of king Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:17">3:9:4:17</span></span>17.
Being about to beat (the Soma with the pressing-stone), let him think in
his mind of him he hates: 'Herewith I strike N.N., not thee!' Now
whosoever kills a human Brâhman here, he, forsooth, is deemed
guilty <span id="fr_596"></span>[1](#fn_594.md),--how much more so he who
strikes him (Soma), for Soma is a god. But they do kill him when they
press him;--they kill him with that (stone): thus he rises from thence,
thus he lives; and thus no guilt is incurred.. But if he hate no one, he
may even think of a straw, and thus no guilt is incurred.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:18">3:9:4:18</span></span>18. He
beats with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 35), 'Fear not, tremble not!' whereby he means
to say, 'Be not afraid, do not tremble, it is N.N. I strike, not
thee!'--'Take thou strength!' whereby he means to say, 'Take
sap!'--'Both ye bowls, that are

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

firm, remain firm, take strength!'--'Surely, it is those two
(pressing-)boards that are thereby meant,' so say some;--what, then, if
one were to break those two boards <span
id="fr_597"></span>[1](#fn_595.md)? But, forsooth, it is these two, heaven
and earth, that tremble for fear of that raised thunderbolt (the stone):
hereby now he propitiates it for those two, heaven and earth; and thus
propitiated it does not injure them. By 'Take strength!' he means to
say, 'Take sap!'--'The evil is slain, not Soma!' he thereby slays every
evil of his.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:19">3:9:4:19</span></span>19.
Thrice he presses <span id="fr_598"></span>[2](#fn_596.md), thrice he
gathers together,

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

four times he performs the Nigrâbha,--this makes ten, for of ten
syllables consists the virâ*g*, and Soma is of virâ*g* nature: therefore
he completes (the ceremony) in ten times.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:20">3:9:4:20</span></span>20.
Then as to why he performs the Nigrâbha. Now when he (Soma) first became
sacrificial food for the gods, he set his heart on those (four) regions,
thinking, 'Could I but consort with those regions as my mate, my loved
resort!' By performing the Nigrâbha, the gods then made him consort with
the regions as his mate, his loved resort; and in like manner does this
(sacrificer) now, by performing the Nigrâbha, make him (Soma) consort
with those regions as his mate, his loved resort.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:21">3:9:4:21</span></span>21. He
performs with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 36), 'From east, from west, from north,
from south--from every side may the regions resort to thee!' whereby he
makes him consort with the regions as his mate, his loved resort. 'O
mother, satisfy (him)! may the noble meet together <span
id="fr_599"></span>[1](#fn_597.md)!' A mother

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (ambâ) is a woman,
and the regions (di*s*, fem.) are women: therefore he says, 'O mother,
satisfy (him)!--May the noble meet together!' The noble doubtless means
people (creatures, offspring): he thus means to say, 'May the people
live in harmony with each other!' Even the people that are far away
(from each other) live in harmony with each other: therefore he says,
'May the noble meet together.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:22">3:9:4:22</span></span>22. Now
as to why he is called Soma. When he first became sacrificial food for
the gods, he thought within him, 'I must not become, sacrificial food
for the gods with my whole self!' That form of his which was most
pleasing he accordingly put aside. Thereupon the gods were victorious;
they said, 'Draw that unto thee, for therewith shalt thou become our
food!' He drew it to him even from afar, saying, verily, that is mine
own (svâ me): hence he was called Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:23">3:9:4:23</span></span>23.
Then as to why he is called Ya*gñ*a (sacrifice). Now, when they press
him, they slay him; and when they spread him <span
id="fr_600"></span>[1](#fn_598.md), they cause him to be born. He is born
in being spread along, he is born moving (yan gâyate): hence yan-*g*a,
for 'ya*ñg*a' they say, is the same as 'ya*gñ*a.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:24">3:9:4:24</span></span>24.
Also this speech did he then utter (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 37;

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rig-veda I, 84,
19), 'Verily thou, a god, shalt extol the mortal, O most mighty! than
thee there is no other giver of joy <span
id="fr_601"></span>[1](#fn_599.md), O lord! unto thee do I speak this word,
O Indra!' For it was indeed as a mortal that he uttered this, 'Thou
alone wilt produce (me) from here, no other but thee!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:4:25">3:9:4:25</span></span>25. And
from the Nigrâbhyâ water they draw the several grahas (cups or libations
of Soma). For it was the waters that slew V*ri*tra, and in virtue of
this prowess they flow; and it is from flowing water that he takes the
Vasatîvarî water, and from the Vasatîvarî the Nigrâbhyâ water; and from
the Nigrâbhyâ water the several grahas are drawn. In virtue of that
prowess, then, the grahas are drawn from the Hot*ri*'s cup. Now the
Hot*ri* means the *Ri*k (fem.), a woman; and from woman creatures are
born here on earth: hence he makes him (Soma) to be born from that
woman, the *Ri*k, the Hot*ri*; wherefore (he takes the grahas) from the
Hot*ri*'s cup.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_586"></span>[238:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_588.md) The Adhvaryu and
sacrificer sit north of them, looking towards the south; and the
assistants of the former--viz. the Pratiprasthât*ri*; Nesh*tri*, and
Unnet*ri*--on the south side, looking northwards. The press-boards were
laid down on the 'sound-holes,' under the fore-part of the southern
Soma-cart, and the pressing-skin was spread over them; see [III, 5, 4,
22](sbe2622.htm#3:5:4:22)-[23](sbe2622.htm#3:5:4:23.md). The Udgât*ri*s, or
chanters, are seated behind the carts.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[238:2](sbe2639.htm#fr_589.md) Viz. the
upâ*ms*usavana, or 'low-voiced pressing (stone),' (see paragraph
[6](sbe2639.htm#3:9:4:6),.md) with which the Soma for the Upâ*ms*u libation
(or cup, graha) is pressed.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[240:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_590.md) It is doubtful what
'pavi' may mean here. It seems to mean originally a metallic mounting,
especially of a shaft. The commentators explain it by 'thunderbolt.'

<span id="fn_589"></span>[240:2](sbe2639.htm#fr_591.md) The sacrificer
holds the Hot*ri*'s cup with the Nigrâbhyâ*h* to his breast.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[240:3](sbe2639.htm#fr_592.md) Viz. by being
placed upon the stone. which is identical with the sun (?); but cf.
[III, 8, 2, 27](sbe2632.htm#3:8:2:27.md).

<span id="fn_591"></span>[241:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_593.md) Tasmâd v iya*m*
manushyeshu mâtrâ yat kaush*th*o yat kumbhî yeya*m* kâ *k*a manushyeshu
mâtrâ. Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[241:2](sbe2639.htm#fr_594.md) According to Taitt.
S. VI, 4, 4 he metes out five times with the above texts, and five times
silently.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[242:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_595.md) The Kâ*n*va MS. has
twice 'tatsthâna,' as Ait. Br. VI, 5, and twice 'tasthâna;' cf. Weber,
Ind. Stud. IX, p. 295.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[243:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_596.md) 'Pari*k*akshate'
ought rather to mean 'they despise him.'

<span id="fn_595"></span>[244:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_597.md) That is to say, in
that case the formula would prove to have been a failure. According to
the Taitt. Kalpas., quoted to Taitt. S. I, 4, 1 (p. 590), he presses the
skin down upon the two press-boards while muttering this formula. The
Kâ*n*va text argues somewhat differently,--ime evaitat phalake âhur iti
haika âhus tad u kim âdriyeta yad athaite bhidyeyâtâm eveme haiva
dyâvâp*ri*thivyâv etasmâd va*g*râd udyatât sa*m*re*g*ete,--'Some say
those two boards are thereby meant; but who would care if they should
get broken; for it is rather those two, heaven and earth,' &c.?

<span id="fn_596"></span>[244:2](sbe2639.htm#fr_598.md) The pressing of the
Upâ*ms*u-graha--also called the 'small' pressing, distinguished from the
'great pressing' (mahâbhishava) for the subsequent cups or libations
(graha)--consists of three turns of eight, eleven, and twelve single
beatings respectively. Before each turn Nigrâbhyâ water is poured upon
the Soma plants by the sacrificer from the Hot*ri*'s cup. After each
turn of pressing the Adhvaryu throws the completely-pressed stalks into
the cup, and when they have become thoroughly soaked, he presses them
out and takes them out again; this being the 'gathering together'
referred to above. At the same time he mutters the Nigrâbha formula
([paragraph 21](sbe2639.htm#3:9:4:21).md); after which the pressed-out
juice, absorbed by the water, is poured into the Upâ*ms*u vessel in the
following manner. Before the pressing the Pratiprasthât*ri* had taken
six Soma-stalks, and put two each between the fingers of his left hand.
After each turn of pressing he takes the Upâ*ms*u vessel with his right
hand and holds one pair of the Soma-stalks over it (or, according to
others, all six at the same time), through which (as through <span
id="page_245">p. 245</span> a strainer) the Adhvaryu then pours the
Soma-juice from the pressing-skin into the vessel. After the third turn
the pressing-stone itself is put into the Hot*ri*'s cup, either with or
without the muttering of the Nigrâbha formula. According to the
commentary on Kâty. IX, 4, 27, the Soma-juice is transferred from the
skin to the Upâ*ms*u cup, by the straining-cloth being made to imbibe
the juice and then being pressed out so as to trickle down through the
plants between the Pratiprasthât*ri*'s fingers. The description given by
Haug, Ait. Br., Transl. p. 489, is somewhat different.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[245:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_599.md) The interpretation
of this formula is very doubtful. The author evidently takes 'arî*h*' as
nom. plur. of 'ari' (= ârya); but it does not appear how he takes
'nishpara,' while Mahîdhara explains it by 'pûraya (give him, Soma, his
fill).' The St. Petersburg Dict. suggests that 'nishpara' may mean 'come
out!' and that 'arî*h*' seems to be a nom. sing. here. I take the last
part of the formula to mean, 'May he (Soma) win (or, perhaps, join) the
longing (waters)!' <span id="page_246">p. 246</span> some of the
Nigrâbhyâ water being poured on the Soma at each turn of pressing; and
small stalks of Soma being, besides, thrown into the Hot*ri*'s cup
containing that water. As to the first part of the formula, it may
perhaps mean, 'Well, pour out (or, pour forth, intrans.).' Professor
Ludwig, Rig-veda IV, p. xvi, thinks that 'nishpara' is a correction of
the Taitt, reading 'nishvara,' which Sâya*n*a interprets, 'O mother
(Soma), come out (from the stalks, in the form of juice),' and according
to the Sûtra quoted by him, the sacrificer is at the same time to think
of the wife he loves.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[246:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_600.md) That is, when they
perform the Soma-sacrifice.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[247:1](sbe2639.htm#fr_601.md) This is the
traditional meaning (sukhayit*ri*) assigned to mar*d*ayit*ri* (the
merciful, comforter); but it is not quite clear how the author of the
Brâhma*n*a interprets it.
