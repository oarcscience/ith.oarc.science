### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:1">3:8:2:1</span></span>1. When
he (the slaughterer) announces, 'The victim has been quieted!' the
Adhvaryu says, 'Nesh*t*ar, lead up the lady!' The Nesh*tri* leads up the
(sacrificer's) wife bearing a vessel of water for washing the feet.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:2">3:8:2:2</span></span>2. He
makes her say (Vâg . S. VI, 12), 'Homage be to thee, O
wide-stretched!'--the wide-stretched one, forsooth, is the sacrifice;
for they stretch the sacrifice (over the sacrificial ground):

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

hence the wide-stretched one is the sacrifice. But that wife, forsooth,
is the hind-part of the sacrifice, and he wants her, thus coming
forward, to propitiate the sacrifice. Thereby, then, she makes amends to
that sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice does not injure her: therefore
she says, 'Homage be to thee, O wide-stretched!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:3">3:8:2:3</span></span>3.
'Advance, unresisted!' whereby she means to say, 'Advance on (a way)
free from injury!' 'Unto the rivers of ghee, along the paths of sacred
truth!' whereby she means to say, 'Unto good.' \[Vâ*g*. S. VI, 13\], 'Ye
divine, pure waters, carry ye (the sacrifice) to the gods,
well-prepared! May we be well-prepared preparers!' Thereby she purifies
the water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:4">3:8:2:4</span></span>4.
Thereupon the wife cleanses with the water the (openings of the) vital
airs of the victim. The reason why she thus cleanses with water the
(openings of the) vital airs is this: the food of the gods is living, is
immortal (ambrosia) for the immortals; but in quieting and cutting up
that victim they kill it. Now the vital airs are water; hence she now
puts into it those vital airs, and thus that food of the gods becomes
truly living, becomes immortal for the immortals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:5">3:8:2:5</span></span>5. Then
as to why it is the wife that cleanses. The wife is a woman, and from
woman progeny is born here on earth; thus he causes that (creature) to
be born from that woman; and therefore the wife cleanses (the victim).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:6">3:8:2:6</span></span>6. With
(Vâ*g*. S. VI, 14) 'Thy speech I cleanse' she wipes the mouth; with 'Thy
breath I cleanse,' the nostrils; with 'Thine eye I cleanse,' the eyes;
with 'Thine organ of hearing I cleanse,' the

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

ears; with 'Thy navel I cleanse,' that mysterious (opening of a) vital
air; or with 'Thy sexual organ I cleanse;' with 'Thy hind-part I
cleanse,' that (opening of a) vital air behind. Thus she puts the vital
airs into it, revives it. Thereupon, holding the legs together, (she
wipes them) with 'Thy feet I cleanse;' for it is on its feet chat it
stands firmly; she thus makes it stand (on its feet) for the sake of a
firm position.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:7">3:8:2:7</span></span>7. With
one half or the whole of the water that is left, he (the Adhvaryu) and
the Sacrificer <span id="fr_478"></span>[1](#fn_476.md) then sprinkle it,
beginning from the head; thereby they put those vital airs into it, and
revive it (beginning) from that part.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:8">3:8:2:8</span></span>8. Thus,
wherever they wound it <span id="fr_479"></span>[2](#fn_477.md), wherever
they hurt it--water being a means of soothing--there they soothe it by
that means of soothing, water, there they heal it with water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:9">3:8:2:9</span></span>9. They
sprinkle with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 15), 'May thy mind grow full! may thy
speech grow full! may thy breath grow full! may thine eye grow full! may
thine ear grow full!' Thus they put the vital airs into it and revive
it: 'Whatever is sore, whatever hurt in thee, may that fill up and
become firm.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:10">3:8:2:10</span></span>10.
Thus, wherever they wound it, wherever they hurt it--water being a means
of soothing--they soothe it by that means of soothing, water, there

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

they heal it with water: 'May that become pure in thee!' thereby they
render it sacrificially pure. With 'Auspicious be the days!' they pour
out (the remaining water) behind the victim.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:11">3:8:2:11</span></span>11.
Thus, wherever they wound it, wherever they hurt it,--lest thereafter
the days and nights should be inauspicious <span
id="fr_480"></span>[1](#fn_478),--they pour out (the water.md) behind the
victim with, 'Auspicious be the days.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:12">3:8:2:12</span></span>12.
Thereupon they turn the victim over so as to lie on its back. He (the
Adhvaryu) puts the (other) stalk of grass thereon, with, 'O plant,
protect!' for the knife is a thunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the
knife, does not injure it (the victim). He then applies the edge of the
knife to it (and cuts through it) with, 'Injure it not, O blade!' for
the knife is a thunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the knife, does
not injure it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:13">3:8:2:13</span></span>13. He
applies that approved edge of his, for that has been made sacrificially
pure by a text <span id="fr_481"></span>[2](#fn_479.md). That which is the
top part of the stalk he puts in his left hand, and that which is the
bottom part he takes with his right hand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:14">3:8:2:14</span></span>14. And
where he skins (the victim), and whence the blood spirts out, there he
smears it (the bottom part with blood) on both ends with (Vâ*g*. S. VI,
I6), 'Thou art the Rakshas' share!' for that blood is indeed the
Rakshas' share.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:15">3:8:2:15</span></span>15.
Having thrown it away (on the utkara), he treads on it with, 'Herewith I
tread down the Rakshas! herewith I drive away the Rakshas! herewith I
consign the Rakshas to the

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

nethermost darkness!' Thus it is by means of the sacrifice that he
drives away the evil spirits, the Rakshas. And as to its being rootless
and severed on both sides,--rootless, forsooth, and severed on both
sides, the Rakshas moves about in the air, even as man here moves about
in the air rootless and severed on both sides: therefore it (the
grass-end) is rootless and severed on both sides.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:16">3:8:2:16</span></span>16.
Thereupon they pull out the omentum, and envelop the two spits <span
id="fr_482"></span>[1](#fn_480.md) therein with, 'May ye envelop heaven and
earth with ghee!' whereby he endows those two, heaven and earth, with
strength and sap, and puts strength and sap into them; and upon those
two, thus filled with sap and affording the means of subsistence, these
creatures subsist.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:17">3:8:2:17</span></span>17. The
two omentum-spits are made of kârshmarya wood. For when the gods in the
beginning seized (slew) a victim, then, as it was drawn upwards, its
sacrificial essence <span id="fr_483"></span>[2](#fn_481.md) flowed
downwards, and from it sprang a tree; and because it flowed down from
the (victim) as it was drawn (karsh) upwards, therefore (it became) a
kârshmarya tree <span id="fr_484"></span>[3](#fn_482.md). With that

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

same sacrificial essence he now perfects it, and makes it whole;
therefore the two omentum-spits are of kârshmarya wood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:18">3:8:2:18</span></span>18. He
cuts it (the omentum) off on all sides (from the belly) and heats it at
the cooking-fire: thus it becomes cooked for him already at this
(fire) <span id="fr_485"></span>[1](#fn_483.md). The Agnîdh again takes a
firebrand (from the *S*âmitra, and walks in front). They go behind the
pit (*k*âtvâla) and proceed to the Âhavanîya. The Adhvaryu throws that
(top part of the) grass-stalk into the Âhavanîya with, 'O Vâyu,
graciously accept the drops!' for this is the kindler (samidh) of the
drops <span id="fr_486"></span>[2](#fn_484.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:19">3:8:2:19</span></span>19.
Thereupon he heats the omentum while standing on the north side; for he
is about to pass by the fire and to roast (the omentum) after walking
round to the south side. Hereby then he propitiates it, and thus that
fire does not injure him while passing by; this is why he heats the
omentum while standing on the north side.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:20">3:8:2:20</span></span>20.
They take it along between the sacrificial stake and the fire. The
reason why they do not take it across the middle (of the altar) <span
id="fr_487"></span>[3](#fn_485.md), where they take other sacrificial
dishes, is lest they should bring the sacrifice in the middle into
contact with the uncooked (omentum). And why they do not take it there
outside (the altar) along the front of the sacrificial stake, is that
they would thereby put it outside the sacrifice; therefore they take it
along

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

between the sacrificial stake and the fire. Having gone round to the
south side, the Pratiprasthât*ri* roasts it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:21">3:8:2:21</span></span>21.
Thereupon the Adhvaryu, having taken ghee with the dipping-spoon, pours
it upon the omentum, with, 'May Agni graciously accept the ghee, Hail!'
Thus those drops thereof reach the fire after becoming cooked offerings,
made with Svâhâ (hail)!

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:22">3:8:2:22</span></span>22. He
then says (to the Maitrâvaru*n*a <span id="fr_488"></span>[1](#fn_486).md),
'Recite to the drops!' He recites to the drops verses addressed to
Agni <span id="fr_489"></span>[2](#fn_487.md). The reason why he recites to
the drops verses addressed to Agni, is that rain originates from gifts
made from this earth, for from here it is that Agni obtains the rain; by
means of these drops (falling from the omentum) he obtains those (rain)
drops, and those drops rain down; therefore he recites to the drops
verses addressed to Agni. When it is roasted,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:23">3:8:2:23</span></span>23. The
Pratiprasthât*ri* says, 'It is roasted: proceed <span
id="fr_490"></span>[3](#fn_488.md)!' The Adhvaryu, having taken the two
spoons and stept across (to the north side of the fire) and called for
the *S*rausha*t*, says (to the Maitrâvaru*n*a), 'Prompt for the
Svâhâs <span id="fr_491"></span>[4](#fn_489)!' and offers (the ghee.md)
when the Vasha*t* has been pronounced <span
id="fr_492"></span>[5](#fn_490.md).

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:24">3:8:2:24</span></span>24.
Having offered, he bastes first the omentum, then the clotted ghee. Now
the Karaka-Adhvaryus, forsooth, baste first the clotted ghee, arguing
that the clotted ghee is the breath; and a *K*araka-Adhvaryu, forsooth,
cursed Yâ*gñ*avalkya for so doing, saying, 'That Adhvaryu has shut out
the breath; the breath shall depart from him!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:25">3:8:2:25</span></span>25. But
he, looking at his arms, said, 'These hoary arms--what in the world has
become of the Brâhman's word <span id="fr_493"></span>[1](#fn_491.md)!' Let
him not heed that (objection of the Karakas); for this is the last
fore-offering,--and this being a havis-offering, at the last
fore-offering he first pours ghee into the dhruvâ, being about to offer
the first two butter-portions with it <span
id="fr_494"></span>[2](#fn_492.md). Now, on the present occasion, he will
first offer the omentum; therefore let him first baste the omentum, then
the clotted ghee. And though he does not baste the victim with ghee,
'lest he should baste the uncooked,' that whole victim of his yet
becomes (as it were) basted with ghee in that he bastes the omentum; let
him therefore first baste the omentum, then the clotted ghee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:26">3:8:2:26</span></span>26.
Thereupon he makes an 'underlayer' of ghee (in the *g*uhû-spoon), and
lays a piece of gold thereon. Then, cutting off the omentum (from the
spits and putting it into the spoon), he says (to the Hot*ri*), 'Recite
(the invitatory prayer) to Agni and Soma

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

for the omentum and fat of the buck!' He then lays (another) piece of
gold on (the omentum) and bastes it twice with ghee above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:27">3:8:2:27</span></span>27. The
reason why there is a piece of gold on both sides is this. When they
offer the victim in the fire they slay it; and gold means immortal life:
hence it (the victim) rests in immortal life. And so it rises from
hence, and so it lives; for this reason there is a piece of gold <span
id="fr_495"></span>[1](#fn_493.md) on both sides. Having called for the
*S*rausha*t*, he says (to the Maitrâvaru*n*a), 'Prompt (the Hot*ri* to
recite the offering-prayer <span id="fr_496"></span>[2](#fn_494) on.md) the
omentum and fat of the buck for Agni and Soma!' He does not say, '. . .
(the omentum and fat) brought forward;' when the Soma has been pressed
he says, 'brought forward <span id="fr_497"></span>[3](#fn_495.md).' He
offers when the Vasha*t* has been pronounced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:28">3:8:2:28</span></span>28.
Having offered the omentum, he lays the two spits together and throws
them after (the omentum into the fire), with, 'Consecrated by Svâhâ, go
ye to Ûrdhvanabhas <span id="fr_498"></span>[4](#fn_496.md), son of the
Maruts!' He does so, thinking, 'Lest these two wherewith we have cooked
the omentum should come to nought.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:29">3:8:2:29</span></span>29. The
reason why they perform with the omen-tum is this. For whatever deity
the victim is seized, that same deity he pleases by means of that fat
(part); and that same deity, thus pleased with that fat, waits

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

patiently for the other sacrificial dishes being cooked; this is why
they perform with the omentum.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:2:30">3:8:2:30</span></span>30.
They then cleanse themselves over the pit <span
id="fr_499"></span>[1](#fn_497.md). For in quieting and cutting up (the
victim) they wound it; and water being a means of soothing, they now
soothe it by means of water, heal it by means of water; therefore they
cleanse themselves over the pit.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[192:1](sbe2632.htm#fr_478.md) Or, perhaps, she
and the sacrificer, as Sâya*n*a takes it (ya*g*amâna*h* patnî *k*a).
Kâty. VI, 6, 4 leaves it doubtful; but the commentator interprets the
rule as referring to the Adhvaryu and Sacrificer, in accordance with the
reading of the Kâ*n*va text--'atha yâ*h* pari*s*ish*t*â âpo bhavanti
tâbhir adhvaryu*s* *k*a ya*g*amâna*s* *k*ânushi*ñk*ata*h*.'

<span id="fn_480"></span>[194:1](sbe2632.htm#fr_482.md) The two
vapâ*s*rapa*n*îs (omentum-roasters) consist of sticks of kârshmarya wood
(Gmelina Arborea), one of them being quite straight, while the other is
bifurcate at the top, thus resembling a prop.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[194:2](sbe2632.htm#fr_483.md) Or, its
flesh-juice, medha. The Kâ*n*va text reads throughout medhas.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[194:3](sbe2632.htm#fr_484.md) The Kâ*n*va text
has the preferable reading,--Sa yat k*ri*shyamâ*n*ât samabhavat tasmât
kârshmaryo nâma, 'and because it sprang from that drawn-up (victim),
therefore it is called kârshmarya.'

<span id="fn_483"></span>[195:1](sbe2632.htm#fr_485.md) \[He does so,
thinking\], 'Lest I should cook it on the Âhavanîya uncooked.' Kâ*n*va

<span id="fn_485"></span>[195:3](sbe2632.htm#fr_487.md) That is, across the
altar immediately behind the fire or high altar.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[196:1](sbe2632.htm#fr_488.md) Thus according to
the commentator on Kâty. VI, 6, 18. See also note on [IV, 2, 5,

<span id="fn_487"></span>[196:2](sbe2632.htm#fr_489) The (invitatory.md)
formulas are Rig-Veda I, 75, 1, and III, 21, 1-5; Ait. Br. II, 12;
Â*s*v. Sr. III, 4, 1.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[196:3](sbe2632.htm#fr_490.md) The
Pratiprasthât*ri* withdraws the omentum from the fire, and takes it
(between fire and stake) to the north of the pit, where the Adhvaryu in
the first place performs the so-called prâ*n*adâna (vol. i, p. 438
note), after which he deposits it on the altar. Kâty. VI, 6, 20.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[196:4](sbe2632.htm#fr_491.md) That is, for the
offering-prayer or yâ*g*yâ of the last fore-offering, being the last
verse of whatever âprî hymn may be used; followed by a number of Svâhâs,
each with the name of some deity or deities (cf. I, 8, 3, 22-23).

<span id="fn_490"></span>[196:5](sbe2632.htm#fr_492.md) Cf. Haug, Transl.
Ait. Br. p. 100, note 4.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[197:1](sbe2632.htm#fr_493.md) That is, so much
time has gone by since I first adopted that practice, and here I am
grown old and still in full vigour, Sây. 'But he, lying old and worn
out, said, "These two arms have become gray--what in the world has
become of the Brahman's word!"' Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[197:2](sbe2632.htm#fr_494.md) On the two
butter-portions to Agni and Soma, succeeding the fore-offerings, see
part i, p. 174 note.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[198:1](sbe2632.htm#fr_495.md) The Kâ*n*va text
has 'hira*n*ya*s*alká (masc.)' here and elsewhere.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[198:2](sbe2632.htm#fr_496.md) The anuvâkyâ and
yâ*g*yâ for the omentum are Rig-veda I, 93, 1 and 5 respectively.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[198:3](sbe2632.htm#fr_497.md) At the animal
offerings on the Soma-days he adds to his praisha (order) the word
'prasthitam,' lit. standing before (the altar). Kâty. VI, 6, 27. See
also *S*. Br. IV, 4, 3, 9.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[198:4](sbe2632.htm#fr_498.md) Ûrdhvanabhas, 'he
who drives the clouds upwards' (or, keeps the clouds above), or,
perhaps, 'he who is above (in) the welkin,' is apparently a name of
Vâyu, the wind. Cf. [III, 6, 1, 16](sbe2623.htm#3:6:1:16.md).

<span id="fn_497"></span>[199:1](sbe2632.htm#fr_499.md) They do so with the
mantra, Vâ*g*. S. VI, 17 (Atharva-veda VII, 89, 3; cf. Rig-veda I, 23,
22; X, 9, 8).
