### NINTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:1">4:6:9:1</span></span>1. Now,
once on a time, the gods were sitting <span
id="fr_1038"></span>[3](#fn_1032.md) in a sacrificial session, thinking,
'May we attain excellence; may we be glorious, may we be eaters of
food!' That same food, gained by them, wished to go away from
them,--and, food being cattle, it was the cattle that wished to go away
from them, thinking, 'It is to be feared lest they, being exhausted, may
hurt us <span id="fr_1039"></span>[4](#fn_1033.md): how, indeed, will they
deal with us?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:2">4:6:9:2</span></span>2. They
offered these two oblations in the Gârhapatya;

<span id="page_447">p. 447</span>

and--the Gârhapatya being a house (g*ri*ha), and a house being a
resting-place--they thereby secured them in the house, and thus that
food, gained by them, did not go away from them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:3">4:6:9:3</span></span>3. And in
like manner do these *S*attrins now sit through a sacrificial session,
thinking, 'May we attain excellence, may we be glorious, may we be
eaters of food!' That food, gained by them, wishes to go away from
them,--and, food being cattle, it is the cattle that wish to go away
from them, thinking, 'It is to be feared lest they, being exhausted, may
hurt us: how, indeed, will they deal with us?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:4">4:6:9:4</span></span>4. They
offer these two oblations <span id="fr_1040"></span>[1](#fn_1034.md) in the
Gârhapatya; and--the Gârhapatya being a house, and the house being a
resting-place--they thereby secure them in the house, and thus that
food, gained by them, does not go away from them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:5">4:6:9:5</span></span>5. And in
like manner that offered food wishes to go away from him, thinking, 'It
is to be feared lest this one will hurt me: how, indeed, will he deal
with me?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:6">4:6:9:6</span></span>6. He
first eats a very little from the further (back) end of it;--thereby he
encourages it: it knows, 'It was not so as I thought: he has in no wise
hurt me.' Thus it becomes attached to him, and, indeed, whosoever,
knowing this, is able to observe the vow thereof, he becomes an eater of
food, dear to food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:7">4:6:9:7</span></span>7. This,
then, is done at the Sattrotthâna (rising from the session) on the tenth
day <span id="fr_1041"></span>[2](#fn_1035.md). Each of them

<span id="page_448">p. 448</span>

sits speechless, strengthening his voice <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[1](#fn_1036): with that (voice.md) strengthened and
reinvigorated they perform the last day. Then the others are dismissed,
either (for) fetching fuel or to their day's reading of the scriptures.
Now also they take food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:8">4:6:9:8</span></span>8. In the
afternoon, having come together and touched water, they enter the
ladies' hall <span id="fr_1043"></span>[2](#fn_1037.md), and while the
others hold on to him from behind, he <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[3](#fn_1038.md)

<span id="page_449">p. 449</span>

offers (on the *S*âlâdvârya fire) those two oblations; (the first) with
(Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 51), 'Here is joy: here rejoice ye! here is stability,
here is (your) own stability,--Hail!' He thereby addresses the cattle;
they thereby secure cattle for themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:9">4:6:9:9</span></span>9. And
the second he offers with, 'Letting the sucking calf to the mother,'--he
means to say by this, 'letting the fire go to the earth;'--'a sucking
calf drinking from the mother,'--he thereby means the fire sucking the
(moisture of the) earth;--'may he maintain increase of wealth among
us,--Hail!' increase of wealth is cattle: they thus secure cattle for
themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:10">4:6:9:10</span></span>10.
They go out eastward, and enter the (shed of the) Havirdhâna carts from
behind towards the front; for from the front towards the back (they
enter) when about to perform the sacrifice, but thus (it is done) at the
rising from the session.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:11">4:6:9:11</span></span>11. On
the hinder shaft of the northern cart <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[1](#fn_1039.md) they sing the Sâman (Vâg . S. VIII,
52), called 'the completion of the session,'--there it is that they
reach completeness; or on the northern hip of the high altar; but the
other is the more usual,

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:12">4:6:9:12</span></span>12.
That is, on the hinder shaft of the northern cart. 'We have gone to the
light, we have become immortal,'--for they who sit through a sacrificial
session become indeed the light, they

<span id="page_450">p. 450</span>

become immortal;--'to the sky have we ascended from the earth,'--for
they who sit through a sacrificial session indeed ascend from the earth
to the sky;--'we have attained to the gods,'--for they indeed attain to
the gods;--'to heaven, to the light!' thrice they repeat the finale; for
they indeed become (partakers of) heaven and bliss. Thus, whatever the
nature of his Sâman is, that they come to be who sit through a
sacrificial session.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:13">4:6:9:13</span></span>13.
They creep <span id="fr_1046"></span>[1](#fn_1040.md) along right under the
axle of the southern cart: even as a snake frees itself from its skin,
so do they free themselves from all evil. They creep along with an
ati*kh*andas verse; for that, the ati*kh*andas (redundant metre), is all
the metres;--thus evil does not overtake them: therefore they creep
along with an ati*kh*andas verse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:14">4:6:9:14</span></span>14.
They creep along with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 53; Rig-veda I, 132, 6), 'O Indra
and Parvata, leaders in battle, smite ye every one that wars against us,
smite him with the thunderbolt! him that is hidden may it please in the
far retreat which he hath reached: our foes, O hero, on all sides may
the tearer tear to pieces,--on all sides!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:15">4:6:9:15</span></span>15.
They go out eastward, and enter the Sadas from the front towards the
back; for from the back towards the front (they do so) when about to
perform the sacrifice; but thus (they do) at the rising from the
session.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:16">4:6:9:16</span></span>16.
They sit down by their several dhish*n*ya-hearths. Now, once on a time,
the pith of Vâ*k* (speech) wished to desert the gods who had won it; it
tried to creep away along this earth, for Vâ*k* is

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

this earth: her pith are these plants and trees. By means of this
Sâman <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1](#fn_1041.md) they overtook it, and,
thus overtaken, it returned to them. Hence upwards on this earth grow
the plants, and upwards the trees. And in like manner does the pith of
Vâ*k* wish to desert these (sacrificers) who have won it, and tries to
creep away along this earth,--for Vâ*k* is this earth: her pith are
these plants and trees. By means of this Sâman they overtake it, and,
thus overtaken, it returns to them. Hence upwards on this earth grow the
plants, and upwards the trees.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:17">4:6:9:17</span></span>17.
They chant verses of the queen of serpents; for the queen of serpents is
this earth: through her they thus obtain everything. The prelude is
performed by (the Udgât*ri*) himself <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[2](#fn_1042.md), and the chant is not joined in (by
the choristers <span id="fr_1049"></span>[3](#fn_1043).md), lest some one
else overhear it. For he would cause (the performance) to be in excess
were another to chant; he would cause an excess, were another to join in
it; he would cause an excess, were another to overhear it: therefore the
prelude is performed by (the Udgât*ri*) himself, and the chant is not
joined in.

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:18">4:6:9:18</span></span>18. The
Hot*ri* recites the Four-Hot*ri* formulas, whereby he follows up that
chant by a *S*astra <span id="fr_1050"></span>[1](#fn_1044.md). If the
Hot*ri* does not know them, let the G*ri*hapati recite them; but it is
the Hot*ri*'s recitation <span id="fr_1051"></span>[2](#fn_1045.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:19">4:6:9:19</span></span>19.
Then the Adhvaryu's response <span id="fr_1052"></span>[3](#fn_1046.md) is,
'These sacrificers have prospered: happiness hath accrued unto them!'
whereby he bespeaks success to human speech.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:20">4:6:9:20</span></span>20.
Thereupon they utter the Brahmodya <span
id="fr_1053"></span>[4](#fn_1047.md) in

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the form of a)
dialogue. For everything, indeed, is obtained, everything gained by them
that sit through a sacrificial session,--they have performed with
Ya*g*us prayers: these have obtained so much, have acquired so much;
they have recited *Ri*k verses: these have obtained so much, have
acquired so much; they have chanted Sâmans: these have obtained so much,
have acquired so much. But this has not been obtained, this has not been
acquired by them, namely, the (theological) discussion, the sacred
discourse: this is what they thereby obtain, what they acquire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:21">4:6:9:21</span></span>21.
Having 'crept' up to the Udumbara post, they restrain their speech. Now,
they who perform the sacrifice with speech, milk and suck out the

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>

sacrifice; for sacrifice is speech. And previously to this, each of them
sits speechless, strengthening his speech <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[1](#fn_1048.md), and with their speech thus
strengthened and reinvigorated they perform the last day. But at this
(disputation) the entire speech, thus obtained, becomes exhausted: that
speech they all strengthen (by remaining) speechless, and with it thus
strengthened and reinvigorated they perform the Atirâtra <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[2](#fn_1049.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:22">4:6:9:22</span></span>22.
They sit touching the Udumbara post <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[3](#fn_1050.md), for strength is food, and the
Udumbara tree is strength: with strength he thus invigorates speech.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:23">4:6:9:23</span></span>23.
When the sun has set, they go out (of the Sadas) eastward, and sit down
behind the Âhavanîya, in front of the Havirdhâna shed. Round them,
sitting speechless, the Pratiprasthât*ri* carries the Vasatîvarî
water <span id="fr_1057"></span>[4](#fn_1051.md). For whatever object they
perform the session, therewith let them release their speech. For in
olden times the *Ri*shis were wont to hold sacrificial sessions for
certain objects,--'such is our wish: may that be fulfilled!' And if they
be desirous of different objects, desirous of subjects, desirous of
offspring, desirous of cattle,--

<span id="page_455">p. 455</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:24">4:6:9:24</span></span>24. Let
them release their speech with this (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 53), 'Earth! Air!
Sky!' Thus they render their speech auspicious by means of the truth,
and with that auspicious (speech) they pray for blessings,--'May we be
abundantly supplied with offspring!'--thereby they pray for
offspring;--'May we be abundantly supplied with men!'--thereby they pray
for men;--'May we be abundantly supplied with food!' thereby they pray
for prosperity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:9:25">4:6:9:25</span></span>25.
Thereupon the G*ri*hapati, or whomsoever the G*ri*hapati may call upon,
recites the Subrahma*n*yâ litany <span
id="fr_1058"></span>[1](#fn_1052.md). Some, indeed, recite the
Subrahma*n*yâ each separately; but rather let the G*ri*hapati, or
whomsoever the G*ri*hapati may call upon, recite the Subrahma*n*yâ.
Having desired an invitation to that (Atirâtra feast), they put
kindling-sticks on the fire <span id="fr_1059"></span>[2](#fn_1053.md).

<span id="fn_1034"></span>[447:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1040.md) Viz. those
referred to in paragraphs [8](sbe2678.htm#4:6:9:8.md) and
[9](sbe2678.htm#4:6:9:9.md).

<span id="fn_1035"></span>[447:2](sbe2678.htm#fr_1041.md) That is, on the
tenth day of the Da*s*arâtra, and hence either the last but one day of
the sessional Dvâda*s*âha ([p. 402](sbe2662.htm#page_402.md), note
[2](sbe2663.htm#fn_935).md), or the last day but two of the Gavâm ayana
([p. 426](sbe2670.htm#page_426), note [3](sbe2671.htm#fn_988).md), called
<span id="page_448">p. 448</span> Avivâkya. The ceremonies here
described take place in the afternoon, after the regular performance of
that day's (atyagnish*t*oma) Soma-sacrifice.

<span id="fn_1036"></span>[448:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1042.md) 'Each of them (?
or, one by one), speech-bound, guards Soma till the wakening,' Kâty.
XII, 4, 1. According to the Kâ*n*va text only one (eko haishâm) does so
(but perhaps at a time), while the others disperse (vitish*th*ante).

<span id="fn_1037"></span>[448:2](sbe2678.htm#fr_1043.md) The Patnî*s*âla
seems to be identical here with the Prâ*k*înava*ms*a (see Kâty. XII, 4,
7), unless it be some shed or tent adjoining the latter, cf. Âpast.
*S*r. X, 5, comm. The sacrificial formula of the first offering seems to
refer to the domestic hearth, the centre of the family life, as a source
of joy and strength to the householder.

<span id="fn_1038"></span>[448:3](sbe2678.htm#fr_1044.md) According to the
Kâ*n*va text, the Adhvaryu makes the oblations; but if he does not know
how to perform them (i.e. if they are not recognised by his school as
belonging to the Adhvaryu's duties), the G*ri*hapati does so; and if he
cannot do so, any one that knows them, may perform them. Regarding these
oblations, and the order of the subsequent ceremonies, there is indeed
considerable difference of opinion among the ritualistic authorities.
According to Â*s*v. VIII, 13, 1-2 all of them offer, but only the first
oblation is to be performed on the Gârhapatya, and the second on the
Âgnîdhrîya. Lâ*t*y. III, 7, 8 seq., on the other hand, enjoins the
Udgât*ri* to perform two oblations on the Gârhapatya; the first with the
(somewhat modified) formula, assigned in our text to the second
oblation, while the second oblation is to be made with 'Svâhâ' simply.
\[The first of the above formulas is, according to that authority, to be
used by them, when they touch the Udumbara post, see [IV, 6, 9,
22](sbe2678.htm#4:6:9:22.md).\] The oblations completed, they are to
proceed to the Âhavanîya, where the Udgât*ri*s are to chant thrice the
Sâman II, 1126 (?); after which they enter the Sadas to perform the
Mânasa-stotra.

<span id="fn_1039"></span>[449:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1045.md) According to
Kâty. XII, 4, 10 and comm., the southern shaft of the northern cart is
intended. Similarly the Kâ*n*va text,--while touching the right shaft of
the northern cart he sings thereon the Sâman 'the completion (success)
of the session.' The words 'sattrasya *ri*ddhi*h*' are doubtless the
name of the Sâman, which has been erroneously made, with 'asi' appended
to it in the Mâdhy. text of the Sa*m*hitâ, the beginning of the Sâman.

<span id="fn_1040"></span>[450:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1046.md) See [p.
299](sbe2648.htm#page_299), note [2](sbe2648.htm#fn_719.md).

<span id="fn_1041"></span>[451:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1047.md) Viz. the
so-called Mânasa-stotra (mental chant), Sâma-veda II, 726-8 (Rig-veda X,
289, 1-3, ascribed to the queen of serpents): 'The spotted bull has come
up, &c.,' performed inaudibly. In connection with this Stotra, an
imaginary libation to Pra*g*âpati-Vâyu is performed, everything
connected with which, from the upâkara*n*a (or introduction, on the part
of the Adhvaryu, see [p. 401](sbe2662.htm#page_401.md), note
[1](sbe2662.htm#fn_931).md) up to the bhaksha, or drinking of the cup by
the priests, is done 'mentally' (that is, as would seem, by gestures
merely). According to. Â*s*v. II, 13, 6, however, the Hot*ri* recites
the same hymn in a low voice (upâ*ms*u), but not inaudibly, as a
*S*astra. But see [p. 452](#page_452), note [1](#fn_1044.md).

<span id="fn_1042"></span>[451:2](sbe2678.htm#fr_1048.md) Not by the
Prastot*ri*, as is otherwise the case; see [p.
310](sbe2649.htm#page_310), note [1](sbe2649.htm#fn_747.md).

<span id="fn_1043"></span>[451:3](sbe2678.htm#fr_1049.md) See [p.
311](sbe2649.htm#page_311), note [1](sbe2649.htm#fn_748.md).

<span id="fn_1044"></span>[452:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1050.md) According to this
(and Tâ*nd*ya Br. IV, 9, 13) it would seem that the Hot*ri* is not to
recite the hymn of the Mânasa-stotra, as prescribed by the Ait. Br. and
Â*s*v.

<span id="fn_1045"></span>[452:2](sbe2678.htm#fr_1051.md) The
*k*aturhot*ri* formulas--so-called from four priests, Agnîdh, Adhvaryu,
Hot*ri*; and Upavakt*ri*; being mentioned in them--are as follows:
'Their offering-spoon was (the power of) thinking; the ghee was thought;
the altar was speech; the barhis was object of meditation; the fire was
intelligence; the Agnîdh was understanding; the oblation was breath; the
Adhvaryu was the Sâman; the Hot*ri* was Vâ*k*aspati; the Upavakt*ri* was
the mind;'--at the end of each of these ten formulas the Adhvaryu,
according to Â*s*v., responds, 'Yea (om), Hotar! So (it is), O
Hotar!'--(the Hot*ri* proceeds), 'They forsooth took that (mânasa)
graha; O Vâ*k*aspati! O disposer (or decree), O name! Let us praise thy
name! Praise thou (and) by our name go to heaven! What success the gods
have obtained with Pra*g*âpati as their g*ri*hapati, that success shall
we obtain!'

<span id="fn_1046"></span>[452:3](sbe2678.htm#fr_1052.md) ? That is, at the
conclusion of the *k*aturhot*ri*-mantras. Â*s*v., on the other hand,
makes the Hot*ri* conclude the Brahmodya with the benediction, 'O
Adhvaryu, we have succeeded!' to which the latter is to respond, 'We
have succeeded, O Hotar!'

<span id="fn_1047"></span>[452:4](sbe2678.htm#fr_1053.md) That is, a
discussion, or disputation, regarding the nature of the Brahman.
According to Tâ*nd*ya Br. IV, 9, 14, as interpreted by the commentary,
the performance consists rather in (or is followed by?) vituperative
remarks on Pra*g*âpati, whom they have now safely got into their power
(allusion being made, for instance, to his criminal relations to his
daughter; to his having created thieves, gad-flies and mosquitos, &c.);
but this, it seems to me, is probably a wrong interpretation of the
'parivadanti' in the text, which may mean that 'they discourse' upon
Pra*g*âpati. So also Kâty. XII, 4, 21, <span id="page_453">p. 453</span>
Pra*g*âpater agu*n*âkhyânam, 'agu*n*a' may have to be taken in the sense
of 'nirgu*n*a' or 'nirgu*n*atvam' (unqualifiedness, unconditionedness),
rather than in that of 'vice;' and it is worthy of note that the
Pra*g*âpati-tanu formulas, preceding the Brahmodya proper, consist
chiefly in the enumeration of negative qualities. 'The twelve bodies of
Prâ*g*apati are qualified as follows:--the eater of food and the
mistress of food; the happy and glorious; the abodeless and dauntless;
the unattained and unattainable; the invincible and irresistible; the
unpreceded and unmatched.' Then follows the Brahmodya:--'Agni is the
house-lord (g*ri*hapati),' so say some: 'he is the house-lord of this
world;'--'Vâyu is the house-lord,' so say some: 'he is the house-lord of
the airy region;'--yonder (sun), forsooth, is the house-lord: he who
burns yonder, he is the lord, and the seasons are the house. Verily, to
whatsoever (sacrificers) he becomes the g*ri*hapati, who knows that
divine g*ri*hapati, that g*ri*hapati prospers, and they, the
sacrificers, prosper: to whatsoever (sacrificers) he becomes the
g*ri*hapati, who knows the divine averter of evil, that g*ri*hapati
averts evil, and they, the sacrificers, avert evil! See Ait. Br. V, 25.
According to Â*s*v., the Hot*ri* alone would seem to repeat the
Brahmodya. The expression vâkovâkya (dialogue) apparently refers to the
controversial form of this discourse. See also A. Ludwig, Rig-veda, III
p. 390 seq.

<span id="fn_1048"></span>[454:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1054.md) The construction
of the text is quite irregular, and I am by no means certain whether
'tâm eshâm purâ' should not be separated from what follows, and have the
verbs 'viduhanti' and 'nirdhayanti' supplied after them,--That (speech)
of theirs (they milk and suck out) before this. Each now sits
speech-bound, strengthening his speech, &c.
