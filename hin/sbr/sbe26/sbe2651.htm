Now the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and the Hot<I>ri</I>, (being) the <I>Ri</I>k (fem.), is a female. And when he chants, then the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, implants seed in the female Hot<I>ri</I>, the <I>Ri</I>k; this the Hot<I>ri</I> brings forth by means of the <I>s</I>astra (recitation), he sharpens</p>

<p>it even as this man is sharpened&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_779"></A><A HREF="#fn_776"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and because he thereby sharpens (<I>s</I>o) therefore it is called sastra.</p>

Having turned round (so as to face the Hot<I>ri</I>, the Adhvaryu) then responds: thereby he quickens&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_780"></A><A HREF="#fn_777"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> that implanted seed. On the other hand, were he to respond while standing with his face turned away (from the Hot<I>ri</I>), that implanted seed would assuredly perish away, and would not be brought forth; but thus facing each other (the male and female) bring forth the implanted seed.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:2:5">4:3:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. Now the strength of the metres was exhausted by the gods, for it was by the metres that the gods attained the world of heaven. And the response (song) is ecstasy (mada&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_781"></A><A HREF="#fn_778"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>)--what ecstasy there is in the <I>ri</I><I>k</I> and that which there is in the S&acirc;man, that is sap: this sap he now lays into the metres, and thus makes the metres of restored strength; and with them of restored strength they perform the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:2:6">4:3:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. Hence if (the Hot<I>ri</I>) recites by half-verses, let (the Adhvaryu) respond at each half-verse; and if he recites by p&acirc;das (hemistichs), let him respond at each p&acirc;da. For whenever, in reciting, he (the Hot<I>ri</I>) draws breath, there the Asura-Rakshas rush into the sacrifice: there he (the Adhvaryu) closes it up by means of the response, so that the evil spirits, the Rakshas, cannot rush in; and thus he destroys the world of the sacrificer's enemies.</p>

Then <I>G</I>agat&icirc; flew up for Soma and came back, leaving behind three syllables. Then Trish<I>t</I>ubh flew up for Soma and came back, leaving behind one syllable. Then G&acirc;yatr&icirc; flew up for Soma, and she came back bringing with her those syllables as well as Soma. Thus she came to consist of eight syllables: wherefore they say, 'G&acirc;yatr&icirc; is octosyllabic.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:2:8">4:3:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. With her they performed the morning feast of the Soma-sacrifice,--whence the morning feast pertains to G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. With her they performed the midday feast. Trish<I>t</I>ubh then said to her, 'To thee will I come with three syllables: invite me, and exclude me not from the sacrifice!'--'So be it!' she said and invited her. Thus the Trish<I>t</I>ubh came to consist of eleven syllables, and therefore they say, 'The midday Soma feast pertains to Trish<I>t</I>ubh.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:2:9">4:3:2:9</A></FONT></span>9.

Thus the <I>G</I>agat&icirc; came to consist of twelve syllables; and therefore they say, 'The evening Soma feast pertains to <I>G</I>agat&icirc;.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_775"></A><A HREF="sbe2651.htm#fr_778">326:1</A> While the Adhvaryu sits before the Sadas, with his back to the Hot<I>ri</I> (<A HREF="sbe2650.htm#page_322">p. 322</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2650.htm#fn_771">1</A>), the latter performs the (t&ucirc;sh<I>n</I>&icirc;m-) <I>g</I>apa--i.e. the muttering of the formula 'May Father M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van grant flawless (verse-) feet! may the bards sing flawless hymns!' &amp;c. Ait. Br. II, 38; &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>r. V, 9, 1--after which he addresses to the Adhvaryu his call (&acirc;h&acirc;va), '<I>s</I>&otilde;<I>m</I>s&acirc;v&otilde;m (let us two recite, Om)!'--which formula is used at all <I>s</I>astras, except that, at the midday and evening libations, it is preceded by 'Adhvaryo' (O Adhvaryu); while at the evening savana the first syllable of the verb is repeated, thus '<I>s</I>o<I>s</I>o<I>m</I>s&acirc;vo.'--The Adhvaryu rises, turns round so as to face the Hot<I>ri</I>, and responds by '<I>s</I>o<I>m</I>s&acirc;mo daiva (we recite, O divine one)!' According to Ait. Br. III, 12, the &Acirc;h&acirc;va and Pratigara together are to consist of the number of syllables corresponding to the metre of the respective libation, viz. 8, 11, 12 respectively. Then follows the Hot<I>ri</I>s T&ucirc;sh<I>n</I>&icirc;<I>m</I>-<I>s</I>a<I>m</I>sa or 'silent praise;' viz. 'Earth! Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Om!--Indra is the light, Ether! the light is Indra, Om! S&ucirc;rya is the light, the light, Heaven! is S&ucirc;rya, Om!'--This is followed by a Puroru<I>k</I>, or preliminary invocation of a deity, recited in a loud voice, (and consisting of twelve short formulas resembling the Nivid part i, p. 114, note 2; ib. I, 4, 2, 5 seq.), which, indeed, takes its place in the <I>s</I>astras of the midday and evening libations, being inserted in the middle or before the last verse of the hymn of the <I>s</I>astra; viz. Agni kindled by the gods, Agni kindled by man, Agni the well-kindling, the Hot<I>ri</I> chosen by the gods, the Hot<I>ri</I> chosen by men, the carrier of offerings, the leader of sacrifices, the irresistible Hot<I>ri</I>, the swift carrier of oblations: may he, the god, <A NAME="page_327"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 327</FONT></A> bring hither the gods! may Agni, the god, worship the gods! may (Agni), the knower of beings, perform the sacrificial rites!' (Ait. Br. II, 34.) Then follows the hymn, the &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya-s&ucirc;kta, the chief part of the <I>s</I>astra, viz. Rig-veda III, 13, 'To him, your god Agni, will I sing with loudest voice; may he come hither to us with the gods; may he, the best offerer, sit down on our sacred grass!' &amp;c.; the seven (anush<I>t</I>ubh) verses of which are recited in the order 1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 2, 7. The first and last verses being, however, repeated thrice, the number is thus raised to eleven. The recitation of the hymn is followed by the so-called ukthav&icirc;rya ('the strength of the praise'), consisting of the formula uktha<I>m</I> v&acirc;<I>k</I>i, 'praise hath been sung,' with some words added to it differing at different <I>s</I>astras,--at the present <I>s</I>astra 'ghosh&acirc;ya tv&acirc;,' 'thee (I have recited) for sound (praise)!' [for school-differences as to these formulas, see Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 177],--to which the Adhvaryu responds, 'Om ukthas&acirc;<I>h</I>,' 'yea, singer of praise!' The Ukthav&icirc;rya, together with the response, is again to consist of as many syllables as the characteristic metre of the respective libation. Then follows the recitation, by the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra (Ait. Br. VI, 14), of the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; or offering prayer, viz. Rig-veda III, 25, 4.--As regards the term '&acirc;<I>g</I>ya,' the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>. Br. VII, 2, 1, 2, derives it from &acirc;<I>g</I>i, a race, in accordance with the following legend: When Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati offered himself as a sacrifice to the gods, the latter could not agree as to which of them should have the first share. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati then proposed that they should run a race for it. In this race Agni came off first, then Mitravaruna, then Indra. To each of these three divinities an &acirc;<I>g</I>ya was thereupon assigned; and, by a secret understanding between Indra and Agni, these two divided the fourth &acirc;<I>g</I>ya between them. Hence the &acirc;gneya, maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a, aindra, and aindr&acirc;gna <I>s</I>astra (and stotra), belonging to the Hot<I>ri</I>, Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a, Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>kh</I>a<I>m</I>sin, and A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka priests respectively.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_780"></A><A HREF="sbe2651.htm#fr_783">330:1</A> When the first verse of the trish<I>t</I>ubh hymn, Rig-veda X, 73, is recited by the Hot<I>ri</I> in the Marutvat&icirc;ya Sastra at the midday feast, the Adhvaryu's response is 'mad&acirc;mo daiva' (we rejoice, O divine one). K&acirc;ty. X, 3, 8; cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, p. 37.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_781"></A><A HREF="sbe2651.htm#fr_784">330:2</A> According to K&acirc;ty. X, 6, 6 'mad&acirc;mo daiva' is optionally the Adhvaryu's response at the recitation in the &Acirc;gnim&acirc;rutra <I>S</I>astra of three of the so-called Anup&acirc;n&icirc;ya (or Sv&acirc;dushkil&icirc;ya) trish<I>t</I>ubh verses VI, 47, 1-4 (see note on <a href="sbe2656.htm#4:4:2:18">IV, 4, 2, 18</A>). Possibly the present paragraph may refer to those verses, in which case the words 'when trish<I>t</I>ubh verses are recited' would begin a fresh paragraph. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, however, seems to take it in the same way as above; cf. also the K&acirc;<I>n</I>va reading in next note.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_782"></A><A HREF="sbe2651.htm#fr_785">330:3</A> This is the (<I>G</I>agat&icirc;) hymn I, 159 recited in the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva Sastra. According to K&acirc;ty. X, 6, 5, the response is to be thrice (after each of the three first verses) 'mad&acirc;mo daiva.' The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va has for paragraphs 10-12, 'At the morning feast he responds by a complete (formula), for complete G&acirc;yatr&icirc; returned.

At the (hymn) to Heaven and Earth he responds with one that contains "mad;" when he recites (the hymn) Heaven and Earth--these creatures subsisting on those two, Heaven and Earth--he thereby puts juice into them, and upon those two, thus rendered juiceful, these creatures subsist. He responds with "Om," for that is truth, that the gods know.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_783"></A><A HREF="sbe2651.htm#fr_786">331:1</A> That is, instead of 'v&acirc;k,' hence 'Oth&acirc;mo daivom.' 'Om' pure and simple is the response at the end of the <I>s</I>astra.</P>
