### FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:1">4:4:1:1</span></span>1.
Savit*ri*, forsooth, is his <span id="fr_836"></span>[1](#fn_833.md) mind:
therefore he draws the Sâvitra cup. And, forsooth, Savit*ri* is his
breath (vital air);--when he draws the Upâ*ms*u cup, then he puts into
him that vital air in front; and when he draws the Sâvitra cup, then he
puts into him that vital air behind: thus those two vital airs on both
sides are beneficial (or, put into him), both that which is above and
that which is below.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:2">4:4:1:2</span></span>2. And
the sacrifice, forsooth, is the seasons, the year. There, at the morning
feast, they are overtly attended to, in that he draws the cups for the
seasons; and at the midday feast they are covertly attended to, in that
he takes the Marutvatîya libations by means of the two Ritu
vessels <span id="fr_837"></span>[2](#fn_834.md). Now here (at the evening
feast) they neither draw any libation expressly for the seasons, nor is
any libation taken with the two Ritu vessels.

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:3">4:4:1:3</span></span>3. But
Savit*ri*, forsooth, is he that burns yonder (the sun); and he indeed is
all the seasons: thus the seasons, the year, are overtly attended to at
the evening feast,--for this reason he draws the Sâvitra cup.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:4">4:4:1:4</span></span>4. He
draws it with the Upâ*ms*u vessel. For Savit*ri* is his mind, and the
Upâ*ms*u is his breath: therefore he draws it with the Upâ*ms*u vessel;
or with the Antaryâma vessel, for that is one and the same, since the
Upâ*ms*u and Antaryâma are the out-breathing and in-breathing <span
id="fr_838"></span>[1](#fn_835.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:5">4:4:1:5</span></span>5. He
draws it from the Âgraya*n*a graha; for Savit*ri* is his mind, and the
Âgraya*n*a is his body (or self): he thus puts the mind into the body.
Savit*ri* is his breath, and the Âgraya*n*a is his body: he thus puts
the breath into the body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:6">4:4:1:6</span></span>6. He
thus draws it therefrom with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 6; Rig-veda VI, 71, 6),
'Bring thou forth boons for us this day, O Savitar, boons to-morrow,
boons day by day: O God, through this our prayer may we be sharers of
boons, of a good and plenteous abode!--Thou art taken with a
support!--Thou art Savit*ri*'s joy-giver, thou art a joy-giver: give me
joy! speed the sacrifice; speed the lord of the sacrifice to (receive)
his share!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:7">4:4:1:7</span></span>7. Having
drawn it, he does not deposit it; for Savit*ri* is his (Ya*gñ*a's) mind,
and hence this mind is restless. And Savit*ri* is his breath: hence this
breath passes to and fro unrestingly. He then says (to the
Maitrâvaru*n*a), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the god Savit*ri*!'
Having called for the

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *S*rausha*t*, he
says, 'Prompt (the Hot*ri* to recite the offering prayer) to the god
Savit*ri*!' The Vasha*t* having been pronounced, he offers. He (the
Hot*ri*) pronounces no Anuvasha*t* <span
id="fr_839"></span>[1](#fn_836.md),--for Savit*ri* is his mind,--'lest he
should consign his mind to the fire;' and Savit*ri* being his
breath,--'lest he should consign his breath to the fire.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:8">4:4:1:8</span></span>8. Then
with the (same) vessel, without drinking therefrom <span
id="fr_840"></span>[2](#fn_837.md), he draws the Vai*s*vadeva graha. The
reason why he draws the Vai*s*vadeva graha with the (same) vessel,
without drinking therefrom, is this: on the Sâvitra graha he (the
Hot*ri*) pronounces no Anuvasha*t*, and it is therefrom that he is about
to draw the Vai*s*vadeva graha,--thus it is by means of the Vai*s*vadeva
that it becomes supplied with the Anuvasha*t* for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:9">4:4:1:9</span></span>9. And
further why he draws the Vai*s*vadeva graha. Savit*ri*, forsooth, is his
rind, and the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* (All-gods, or all the gods <span
id="fr_841"></span>[3](#fn_838).md) are everything here: he thus makes
everything here subservient and obedient to the mind, and hence
everything here is subservient and obedient to the mind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:10">4:4:1:10</span></span>10. And
again why he draws the Vai*s*vadeva graha. Savit*ri*, forsooth, is his
breath, and the All-gods are everything here: he thereby puts the
out-breathing and in-breathing into everything here, and

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

thus the out-breathing and in-breathing become beneficial (or put) in
everything here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:11">4:4:1:11</span></span>11. And
again why he draws the Vai*s*vadeva graha. The evening feast belongs to
the All-gods: thus indeed it is called on the part of the Sâman, in that
the evening feast is called Vai*s*vadeva on the part of the *Rik* <span
id="fr_842"></span>[1](#fn_839.md), and in the same way on the part of the
Ya*g*us, by way of preparatory rite, when he draws that
Mahâ-vai*s*vadeva graha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:12">4:4:1:12</span></span>12. He
draws it from the Pûtabh*ri*t; for the Pûtabh*ri*t belongs to the
All-gods, because therefrom they draw (Soma juice) for the gods,
therefrom for men, therefrom for the Fathers: hence the Pûtabh*ri*t
belongs to the All-gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:13">4:4:1:13</span></span>13. He
draws it without a puroru*k* <span id="fr_843"></span>[2](#fn_840.md), for
he draws it for the All-gods, and the All-gods are everything, the *Rik*
and Ya*g*us and Sâman; and even in that he draws it for the All-gods,
thereby it becomes supplied with a puroru*k* for him: therefore he draws
it without a puroru*k*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:14">4:4:1:14</span></span>14. He
thus draws it therefrom with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 8), 'Thou art taken with a
support: thou art well-guarded, well-established,'--for well-guarded and
well-established is the breath,--'homage to the great bull!'--the great
bull is Pra*g*âpati (the lord of creatures): 'homage to Pra*g*âpati,' he
thereby means to say.--'Thee to the All-gods! this is thy womb,--thee to
the All-gods!' Therewith he

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

deposits it; for it is for the All-gods that he draws it. Thereupon he
goes (to the Sadas) and sits down (in front of the Hot*ri*) with his
face to the east <span id="fr_844"></span>[1](#fn_841.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:15">4:4:1:15</span></span>15. And
when he (the Hot*ri*) recites this (verse), 'With one and ten for thine
own sake, with two and twenty for offering, with three and thirty for
up-bearing (the sacrifice to the gods); with thy teams, O Vâyu, do thou
here unloose them!'--during (the recitation of) this verse to Vâyu the
drinking-vessels are unyoked <span id="fr_845"></span>[2](#fn_842.md), for
beasts have Vâyu for their leader; and Vâyu

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (wind) is breath,
since it is by means of the breath that beasts move about.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:16">4:4:1:16</span></span>16. Now
once on a time he went away from the gods with the beasts. The gods
called after him at the morning pressing,--he returned not. They called
after him at the midday pressing,--but he returned not. They called
after him at the evening pressing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:17">4:4:1:17</span></span>17.
Being about to return, he said, 'If I were to return to you, what would
be my reward? '--'By thee these vessels would be yoked, and by thee they
would be unloosed!'--Hence those vessels are yoked by that (Vâyu), when
he (the Adhvaryu) draws the (cups) for Indra and Vâyu and so forth <span
id="fr_846"></span>[1](#fn_843.md). And now those vessels are unloosed by
him, when he says, 'with thy teams, O Vâyu, do thou here unloose
them;'--teams mean cattle: thus he unlooses those vessels by means of
cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:1:18">4:4:1:18</span></span>18.
Now, had he returned at the morning pressing--the morning pressing
belonging to the Gâyatrî, and the Gâyatrî being the priesthood <span
id="fr_847"></span>[2](#fn_844.md)--then cattle would have come to be with
priests only. And had he returned at the midday pressing--the midday
pressing belonging to Indra, and Indra being the nobility--cattle would
have come to be with nobles only. But in that he returned at the evening
pressing--the evening pressing belonging to the All-gods, and the
All-gods being everything here--therefore there are cattle everywhere
here.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[359:2](sbe2655.htm#fr_840.md) Lit. 'with the
not-drunk-from vessel.' He is not to drink with the Hot*ri* the remains
of the Sâvitra graha, which is to be offered up entirely (holocaust).

<span id="fn_838"></span>[359:3](sbe2655.htm#fr_841.md) In Ait. Br. III, 31
five classes of beings, viz. the gods and men, the Gandharva-Apsaras,
the serpents and the manes, are included in the term Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[360:1](sbe2655.htm#fr_842.md) The first *s*astra
of the T*ri*tîya-savana, now about to be recited by the Hot*ri*
(Rig-veda priest), is the Vai*s*vadeva *s*astra; hence also, he argues,
it is Vai*s*vadeva on the part of the Sâman, because of the intimate
connection of the Sâman chants (here the T*ri*tîya, or Ârbhava, pavamâna
stotra; see [p. 325](sbe2650.htm#page_325.md), note
[2](sbe2651.htm#fn_774).md) with the *s*astras.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[360:2](sbe2655.htm#fr_843.md) See [p.
268](sbe2642.htm#page_268), note [1](sbe2642.htm#fn_643.md).

<span id="fn_841"></span>[361:1](sbe2655.htm#fr_844.md) He remains thus
seated till the Hot*ri* utters the Âhâva 'Adhvaryo *s*o*s*a*m*sâvom'
(Adhvaryu, let us sing!), when he turns round and makes his response
(pratigara) '*S*amsâmo daivom.' See [p. 326](sbe2651.htm#page_326.md), note
[1](sbe2651.htm#fn_775.md).

The Vai*s*vadeva *s*astra consists of the following parts:--

Pratipad (opening triplet), Rig-veda V, 82, 1-3.

Anu*k*ara (sequel), ib. 4-7.

Sûkta (hymn) to Savit*ri*, IV, 54. Before the last verse the Nivid ('May
the god Savit*ri* drink of the Soma!' &c.) is inserted; to which the
verse to Vâyu, referred to in [paragraph 15](sbe2655.htm#4:4:1:15.md), is
added.

Sûkta to Heaven and Earth, I, 159, with the Nivid 'May Heaven and Earth
delight in the Soma!' &c., inserted before the last verse; the
Adhvaryu's response being thrice Madâmo daiva,' see [p.
330](sbe2651.htm#page_330), note [3](sbe2651.htm#fn_782.md).

Dhâyyâ verse, I, 4, 1.

Sûkta to the *Ri*bhus, I, 111; with Nivid before the last verse.

Three Dhâyyâs, X, 123, 1; X, 63, 3; IV, 50, 6.

Sûkta to Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*, I, 89; with Nivid before the last verse.

The concluding verse (paridhânîyâ) is recited thrice; the first time
with stops at every half verse, the second and third time at every pâda.

Ukthavîrya, 'Praise has been sung to Indra, to the gods, to hear thee!'

Then follows the recitation of the offering prayer VI, 52, 13, after
which the libation is made, the remaining juice being then drunk, as
well as that in the *k*amasas.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[361:2](sbe2655.htm#fr_845.md) That is, having
been rinsed in the Mâr*g*âlîya, the three dvidevatya are deposited on
the khara by the Pratiprasthât*ri*.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[362:1](sbe2655.htm#fr_846.md) See [IV, 1,
3](sbe2642.htm#4:1:3.md).

<span id="fn_844"></span>[362:2](sbe2655.htm#fr_847.md) Perhaps we ought to
read, with the Kâ*n*va text, gâyatra*m* vai prâta*h*savana*m* gâyatra*m*
agne*s* *kh*ando brahma vâ agnir, brâhma*n*eshu haiva pa*s*avo
’bhavishyan, 'the morning pressing relating to the gâyatrî, and the
gâyatrî metre belonging to Agni, and Agni being the priesthood.'
