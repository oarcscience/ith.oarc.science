### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:1">4:5:2:1</span></span>1. They
lay hands on the barren cow <span id="fr_914"></span>[1](#fn_911.md), and
having laid hands on it, they quiet it. It having been quieted <span
id="fr_915"></span>[2](#fn_912), he says (to the slaughterer.md), 'Pull out
the omentum!' The omentum having been pulled out <span
id="fr_916"></span>[2](#fn_912), let him tell (the slaughterer.md) to
search groping for an embryo. If they do not find one, why need they
care? and if they find one, atonement is made therefore.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:2">4:5:2:2</span></span>2. For
surely it is not right that, thinking it to be one (cow), they should
perform, as it were, with that one; or that, thinking them to be two,
they should perform, as it were, with two <span
id="fr_917"></span>[3](#fn_913.md). Let him bid (the

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

slaughterer) get ready the pot (sthâlî) and the cloth (ush*n*îsha) <span
id="fr_918"></span>[1](#fn_914.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:3">4:5:2:3</span></span>3. They
then perform with the omentum, just as its mode of performance is <span
id="fr_919"></span>[2](#fn_915.md). Having performed with the omentum, both
the Adhvaryu and Sacrificer return (to the sacrificial ground). The
Adhvaryu says, 'Pull out that embryo!' otherwise he would not pull it
out from the womb, since it is only pulled out from the womb of a sick
or dead (female); but when the embryo is full grown, then indeed it
comes out through birth: let him bid him pull it out even after tearing
asunder the thighs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:4">4:5:2:4</span></span>4. When
it is pulled out, he addresses it with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 28), 'May the
embryo of ten months move together with the caul!'--by saying, 'May it
move,' he puts breath into it; and 'of ten months' he says, because when
an embryo is full grown, then it is one of ten months: thus, even though
it is not ten months old, he makes it one of ten months by means of the
Brahman (prayer), the Ya*g*us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:5">4:5:2:5</span></span>5.
'Together with the caul'--this he says so that, like a ten months’
(calf), it may go out with the caul <span
id="fr_920"></span>[3](#fn_916.md),--'As yonder wind moveth, as the ocean
moveth;'--thereby he puts breath into it;--'So hath this ten months'
(calf) slipped out with the caul;'--this he means to say so that, like a
ten months’ calf, it may slip out with the caul.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:6">4:5:2:6</span></span>6. Here
now they say, 'What is he to do with

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

that embryo?'--They might cut off a portion from every limb, even as (is
done) the portioning of other portions. But let him not do so; for that
(embryo) surely has its limbs undeveloped. Having cut it below the neck,
they should let that fat juice drip into the pot; for that same juice
drips from all its limbs, and thus it is a portion cut out from all its
limbs. He then cuts the sacrificial portions of the cow in the same way
in which they are (usually) portioned off.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:7">4:5:2:7</span></span>7. They
cook them on the cooking-fire of the animal offering: at the same
time <span id="fr_921"></span>[1](#fn_917.md) they cook that fat juice.
Having wrapped the embryo in the cloth, he lays it down by the side of
the cooking-fire. When it (the victim) is cooked, he puts together <span
id="fr_922"></span>[2](#fn_918) the (flesh.md) portions and bastes only
them, but not that juice. They remove the victim (from the fire); and at
the same time they remove that juice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:8">4:5:2:8</span></span>8. They
take it along the back of the pit, between the sacrificial stake and the
fire. It having been put down south (of the fire), the Pratiprasthât*ri*
cuts off the sacrificial portions. He then makes an under-layer (of
ghee) in both offering-spoons, and addresses (the Hot*ri*) for the
recitation to the Manotâ deity on the havis. Thereupon they make
cuttings from the portions of the cow, in the same way in which cuttings
are made from them <span id="fr_923"></span>[3](#fn_919.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:9">4:5:2:9</span></span>9. Now
there is an offering-spoon called pra*k*ara*n*î

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

therein the Pratiprasthât*ri* makes an underlayer of ghee for the fat
juice, takes two portions (from the juice), bastes them once (with
ghee), and replenishes (the juice whence) both portions (have been
taken). He (the Adhvaryu) then addresses (the Hot*ri*) for. the
recitation (of the invitatory prayer). Having called for the
*S*rausha*t*, he says (to the Maitrâvaru*n*a), 'Prompt (the Hot*ri* to
recite the offering prayer)!' As the Vasha*t* is uttered, the Adhvaryu
offers (the flesh portions). After the Adhvaryu's oblation the
Pratiprasthât*ri* offers (the fat juice)--

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:10">4:5:2:10</span></span>10.
With (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 29), 'Thou whose fruit is fit for sacrifice,'--for
embryos are unfit for sacrifice: this one he thus makes fit for
sacrifice by means of the Brahman, the Ya*g*us;--'thou who hast a golden
womb,'--for on that former occasion <span
id="fr_924"></span>[1](#fn_920.md), they rend the womb when they tear out
(the embryo); and gold means immortal life; he thus makes that womb of
her (the cow) immortal;--'Him whose limbs are unbroken, I have brought
together with his mother, Hail!' Thus, if it be a male (embryo); but if
it be a female one, with, 'Her whose limbs are unbroken, I have brought
together with her mother, Hail!' And, if it be an indistinguishable
embryo, let him offer in making it male, since embryos (garbha, masc.)
are male, 'Him whose limbs are unbroken, I have brought together with
his mother, Hail!' For on that former occasion, when they tear out (the
embryo) they separate it from its mother: now, having rendered it
successful by means of the Brahman, the Ya*g*us, he brings it again
together with its mother in the midst of the sacrifice.

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:11">4:5:2:11</span></span>11.
Thereupon the Adhvaryu makes the oblation to the Lord of the
forest <span id="fr_925"></span>[1](#fn_921.md). Having made the oblation
to the Lord of the forest, the Adhvaryu, while pouring together the
sacrificial portions that are for the upabh*rit*, says (to the Hot*ri*),
'Recite the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t!' The
Pratiprasthât*ri* comes and takes all that fat juice, and pours twice
(ghee) thereon. Having called for the *S*rausha*t*, the Adhvaryu says,
'Prompt!' and offers as the Vasha*t* is uttered. After the Adhvaryu's
oblation the Pratiprasthât*ri* offers,

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:12">4:5:2:12</span></span>12.
With (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 30), 'The bountiful multiform juice <span
id="fr_926"></span>[2](#fn_922.md),'--by 'bountiful' he means to say (the
bestower) 'of numerous gifts;' and 'the multiform' he says, because
embryos are, as it were, multiform,--'The strong juice hath invested
itself with greatness:'--for it (the embryo) is indeed invested <span
id="fr_927"></span>[3](#fn_923.md) in the mother.--'May the worlds spread
along her, the one-footed, two-footed, three-footed, four-footed,
eight-footed,'--'Hail!' He thereby magnifies her (the cow): far more,
forsooth, does he gain by offering an eight-footed one, than by one not
eight-footed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:13">4:5:2:13</span></span>13.
Here now they say, 'What is he to do with that embryo <span
id="fr_928"></span>[4](#fn_924.md)?' They may expose it on a tree; for

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

embryos have the air for their support, and the tree is, as it were, the
same as the air: thus he establishes it on its own support. But, say
they, if, in that case, any one were to curse him, saying, 'They shall
expose him <span id="fr_929"></span>[1](#fn_925.md) dead on a tree,' then
verily it would be so.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:14">4:5:2:14</span></span>14.
They may throw it into the water, for water is the support of everything
here: he thus establishes it in the water. But, say they, if, in that
case, any one were to curse him, saying, 'He shall die in water!' then
verily it would be so.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:15">4:5:2:15</span></span>15.
They may bury it ins a mole-hill; for this (earth) is the support of
everything here: he thus establishes it on this same (earth). But, say
they, if, in that case, any one were to curse him, saying, 'They shall
quickly prepare a burying-place for him, being dead!' then verily it
would be so.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:16">4:5:2:16</span></span>16. He
may offer it to the Maruts on the cooking-fire of the animal sacrifice;
for the Maruts, the clans (common people) of the gods, are not
oblation-eaters (ahuta-ad) <span id="fr_930"></span>[2](#fn_926.md), and
the uncooked embryo, as it were, is no oblation (ahuta); and the animal
cooking-fire is taken from the Âhavanîya: thus indeed it (the embryo) is

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

not excluded from the sacrifice, and yet is not (offered) directly in
the Âhavanîya (offering-fire). And the Maruts are of the gods: he thus
establishes it with the Maruts <span id="fr_931"></span>[1](#fn_927.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:17">4:5:2:17</span></span>17. As
soon as he has performed the Samish*t*aya*g*us offerings, when the coals
are only just extinguished, he takes that embryo with the cloth, and
standing with his face to the east, he offers it with a verse to the
Maruts (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 31; Rig-veda I. 86, 1),--'Verily, O Maruts, in
whosesoever house ye drink, the heroes of the sky, he is the best
protected man.' He utters no Svâhâ (hail), for the Maruts, the clans of
the gods are no oblation-eaters, and no oblation, as it were, is what is
offered without Svâhâ. And the Maruts are of the gods: he thus
establishes it with the Maruts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:2:18">4:5:2:18</span></span>18. He
then covers it over with the coals with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 32; Rig-veda I,
22, 13), 'The great Heaven and Earth may mix this our sacrifice, and
fill us with nourishments!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_911"></span>[391:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_914.md) The order of this
and the succeeding Brâhma*n*as differs considerably in the two
recensions. In the Kâ*n*va recension the present Brâhma*n*a (the text of
which also differs very much) is preceded by three others (V, 6, 1-3),
corresponding to M. IV, 5, 3; IV, 5, 4 and IV, 5, 6, respectively.

<span id="fn_912"></span>[391:2](sbe2661.htm#fr_916.md) The text has
simply, he (viz. the Samit*ri* or butcher) having quieted it, he (the
Adhvaryu) says, (*S*.) having pulled it out, let him (A.) bid. . . .

<span id="fn_913"></span>[391:3](sbe2661.htm#fr_917.md) The meaning of this
would seem to be, that they should not content themselves with the
supposition of its being a barren cow, but that they should ascertain
whether she is not--as the term is--'ash*t*âpadî,' or eight-footed, i.e.
a cow with calf (cf. [par. 12](sbe2661.htm#4:5:2:12).md), and should in
that case make atonement. The Kâ*n*va text reads, Now when they thus
proceed with that (animal offering), they, thinking it to be one (cow)
only, pronounce the âprî verses (âprî*n*anti). They turn out to be two
(te dve bhavata*h*); and surely it is not right that one should cast
away that on which the âprî verses have been pronounced. Now that juice
has flowed together from all the limbs: thus offering is also made with
those sacrificial portions of that (embryo). And the sacrifice is as
much as the havis and Svish*t*ak*ri*t: he thus connects that whole
(embryo) with that sacrifice, <span id="page_391">p. 391</span> and thus
that which is superfluous (atirikta) becomes not superfluous.

<span id="fn_914"></span>[392:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_918.md) The comm. on Kâty.
XXV, 10, 7, describes the ush*n*îsha, used on this occasion, as a small
cloth, or kerchief.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[392:2](sbe2661.htm#fr_919.md) See [III, 8, 2,
16](sbe2632.htm#3:8:2:16.md) seq.

<span id="fn_916"></span>[392:3](sbe2661.htm#fr_920.md) Or, even as a ten
months’ calf moves with the caul, so he means to say (that) this (should
take place).

<span id="fn_917"></span>[393:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_921.md) Or, in the same
place. The Kâ*n*va text reads, Having cut off the head, and let the
juice (rasa) flow out, he cooks it by the side of (prative*s*am) the
(flesh) portions. And when they proceed with the havis, then having made
an underlayer of ghee, and, taking twice from that juice, having basted
(the portions therewith), he replenishes the (places of the) two
portions.

<span id="fn_918"></span>[393:2](sbe2661.htm#fr_922.md) ? Read 'samuhya'
for 'samudya.' See [III, 8, 3, 5](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:5.md) seq.

<span id="fn_919"></span>[393:3](sbe2661.htm#fr_923.md) See [III, 8, 3,
15](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:15.md) seq.

<span id="fn_920"></span>[394:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_924.md) See [par.
3](sbe2661.htm#4:5:2:3.md).

<span id="fn_921"></span>[395:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_925.md) See [III, 8, 3,
33](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:33.md).

<span id="fn_922"></span>[395:2](sbe2661.htm#fr_926.md) Indu, lit. 'droop,'
a term usually applied to the draughts of Soma, a connection with which
doubtless is here intended.

<span id="fn_923"></span>[395:3](sbe2661.htm#fr_927.md) A different simile
is implied in the original 'antar mahimânam âna*ñg*a.'

<span id="fn_924"></span>[395:4](sbe2661.htm#fr_928.md) The Kâ*n*va text is
much briefer here: He then ties up the head (*s*ira*h* pratinahya, ?
with the body) either with a cloth (ush*n*îsha), or with bast (vakala),
and having pushed asunder the cooking-fire of the animal offering, he
lays it above them, with 'Verily, O Maruts . . .,' for the common people
are eaters of raw flesh, and the Maruts <span id="page_396">p.
396</span> are the people: he thus establishes it with the Maruts. Or
(uto) with a verse to Heaven and Earth, 'The great Heaven and Earth . .
.,' for additional superfluous (atirikta) is that (garbha), beyond these
two, heaven and earth, nothing whatever remains (or, nothing surpasses
them, atiri*k*yata): thus he establishes it within those two, heaven and
earth; and while being superfluous, it comes to be no longer superfluous
(or redundant).

<span id="fn_925"></span>[396:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_929.md) 'Enam' apparently
refers both to the sacrificer and to the embryo (garbha, masc.).

<span id="fn_926"></span>[396:2](sbe2661.htm#fr_930.md) For the common
people are eaters of raw flesh (âmâd), and the Maruts are the people.
Kâ*n*va text. Neither a Kshatriya nor a Vai*s*ya can eat remains of
offerings, but only a Brâhman is hutâd, Ait. Br. VII, 19.

<span id="fn_927"></span>[397:1](sbe2661.htm#fr_931.md) One might expect
'deveshu:' thus he establishes it with the gods; unless it is intended
as the final decision: 'hence he consigns it to the Maruts.' The wording
is, however, the same as in the preceding paragraphs.
