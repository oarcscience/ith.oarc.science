### SIXTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:1">4:6:1:1</span></span>1. Now,
the A*ms*u (graha), forsooth, is no other than Pra*g*âpati: that (cup)
is his (Ya*gñ*a's or the

<span id="page_424">p. 424</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sacrificer's)
self <span id="fr_989"></span>[1](#fn_983.md), for Pra*g*âpati is the self.
Hence when they draw that (cup) they produce that self of his. Therein
they lay these vital airs, according to as these vital airs, the grahas,
are explained <span id="fr_990"></span>[2](#fn_984.md); and verily the
sacrificer is born with his whole body in yonder world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:2">4:6:1:2</span></span>2. Where
they draw that (cup), then that is (like) having a hold <span
id="fr_991"></span>[3](#fn_985.md); and where they do not draw it, then
that is (like) having no hold: therefore, then, he draws the A*ms*u.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:3">4:6:1:3</span></span>3. He
draws it with a vessel of u*d*umbara wood; for that (cup) is
Pra*g*âpati, and the u*d*umbara tree is Pra*g*âpati's own: therefore he
draws it with a vessel of u*d*umbara wood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:4">4:6:1:4</span></span>4. He
draws it with a square vessel; for there are here three worlds: these
three worlds he obtains by three (corners). And Pra*g*âpati is the
fourth over and above these three worlds: thus he obtains Pra*g*âpati by
the fourth (corner): therefore he draws it with a square vessel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:5">4:6:1:5</span></span>5.
Silently he takes up the pressing-stone; silently he throws down the
Soma-plants (a*ms*u); silently he pours water thereon; silently raising
(the stone), he

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

presses once; silently he offers that (libation) without drawing breath:
thus he makes him (the sacrificer) to be Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:6">4:6:1:6</span></span>6. Now
there is a piece of gold in that (spoon): that he smells at. And if he
either galls or scratches himself at this (sacrifice),--gold being
immortal life,--he lays that immortal life into his own self.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:7">4:6:1:7</span></span>7. As to
this Râma Aupatasvini said, 'Let him freely breathe out and freely
breathe in: if he but offers silently, thereby he makes him (the
sacrificer) to be Pra*g*âpati.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:8">4:6:1:8</span></span>8. Now
there is a piece of gold in that (spoon): that he smells at. And if he
either galls or scratches himself at this (sacrifice),--gold being
immortal life, he lays that immortal life into his own self.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:9">4:6:1:9</span></span>9. As to
this Budila Â*s*vatarâ*s*vi said, 'Let him draw it after merely raising
(the stone), and let him not press; for they do press for other deities:
thus he does different from what he does for other deities; and in that
he raises (the stone) thereby indeed the pressing takes place for him.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:10">4:6:1:10</span></span>10. As
to this Yâ*gñ*avalkya said, 'Nay, let him press: "The unpressed Soma
delighted not the mighty Indra, nor the outpressed draughts without
prayer," thus spake the *Ri*shi (Rig-veda VII, 26, I). For no other
deity does he strike but once: thus he does different from what he does
for other deities,--therefore let him press!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:11">4:6:1:11</span></span>11.
Twelve heifers pregnant with their first calf are the priests' fee for
this (graha). Now there are twelve months in the year, and Pra*g*âpati
is the year, and the A*ms*u is Pra*g*âpati: thus he makes him (the
sacrificer) to be Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:12">4:6:1:12</span></span>12.
They have twelve embryo calves,--that makes

<span id="page_426">p. 426</span>

twenty-four. Now there are twenty-four half-moons in the year, and
Pra*g*âpati is the year, and the A*ms*u is Pra*g*âpati: thus he makes
him to be Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:13">4:6:1:13</span></span>13. Now
Kaukûsta <span id="fr_992"></span>[1](#fn_986.md) indeed gave as many as
twenty-four heifers with their first calf as dakshi*n*âs, and a bull as
the twenty-fifth, and gold; and truly that is what he gave.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:14">4:6:1:14</span></span>14.
This (graha) should not be drawn for every one, since this is his
(Ya*gñ*a's) self. It should only be drawn for one who is well known, or
one who is his (the Adhvaryu's) friend, or one who, being learned in
sacred lore, would acquire it by his study.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:1:15">4:6:1:15</span></span>15. It
should be drawn at a (sacrifice with) a thousand (cows as the priests’
fee); for a thousand is everything, and this (graha) is everything. It
should be drawn at (a sacrifice) where the entire property is given
away, for the entire property is everything, and this (graha) is
everything. It should be drawn at a Vi*s*va*g*it with all the
P*ri*sh*th*as, for the Vi*s*va*g*it ('all-conquering') is everything,
and this (cup) is everything. It should be drawn at a Vâ*g*apeya and
Râ*g*asûya, for that is everything. It should be drawn at a sattra
(sacrificial session), for the sattra means everything <span
id="fr_993"></span>[2](#fn_987), and this (cup.md) means everything. These
are the drawings.

<span id="fn_983"></span>[424:1](sbe2670.htm#fr_989) Or body (âtman.md);
a*ms*u meaning the Soma-plant, and hence the body of the Soma. This
graha seems to consist of imperfectly pressed Soma-plants in water. Cf.
Kâty. XII, 5, 6-12. See also *S*at. Br. IV, I, I, 2; Taitt. S. VI, 6,
10; Sây. on Taitt. S. I, p. 603. In the Kâ*n*va text this Brâhma*n*a is
followed by one on the Adâbhya graha, which is identified with speech.

<span id="fn_984"></span>[424:2](sbe2670.htm#fr_990.md) Or, perhaps,
according to as the grahas are explained as being these vital airs.

<span id="fn_985"></span>[424:3](sbe2670.htm#fr_991.md) Or, like something
that has a handle. The Kâ*n*va text reads,--for whomsoever they draw
that (cup), his vital airs are, as it were, supplied' with a firmer
hold, and, as it were, firmly established (ârambha*n*avattarâ iva
pratish*th*itâ iva). And for whomsoever they do not draw it, his vital
airs are, as it were, without any hold ('haltloser') and quite
unrestrained (anârambha*n*atarâ ivâsyâyatatarâ iva prâ*n*â*h*).

<span id="fn_986"></span>[426:1](sbe2670.htm#fr_992.md) The Kâ*n*va MISS.
read 'Kaükthasta.'

<span id="fn_987"></span>[426:2](sbe2670.htm#fr_993.md) Perhaps the author
here means to connect sattra (satra) with the adverbs satram, satrâ,
'altogether, always,' instead of with the verb sad, to sit; but cf. [IV,
6, 8, 1](sbe2677.htm#4:6:8:1.md).
