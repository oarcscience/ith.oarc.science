### SEVENTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:1">4:6:7:1</span></span>1.
Threefold, forsooth, is science; the *Rik*s, the Ya*g*us, and the
Sâmans. The *Rik*s are this (earth), since it is thereon that he who
sings them, does sing them; the *Rik*s are speech, since it is by speech
that he who sings them, does sing them. And the Ya*g*us, forsooth, are
the air, and the Sâmans the sky. That same threefold science is used in
the Soma-sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:2">4:6:7:2</span></span>2. By the
*Rik* he conquers this world, by the Ya*g*us the air, and by the Sâman
the sky. Therefore whosoever has learnt one of these sciences, let him
endeavour to learn also what is contained in the two others: by the
*Rik*, forsooth, he conquers this world, by the Ya*g*us the air, and by
the Sâman the sky.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:3">4:6:7:3</span></span>3. This,
then, is the thousandfold progeny of Vâ*k* (speech) <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[1](#fn_1012). Indra (obtained for his share.md)
two-thirds, and Vish*n*u one-third <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[2](#fn_1013.md): the *Rik*s and Sâmans are Indra, and
the Ya*g*us are Vish*n*u. Therefore in the Sadas they perform (the
*S*astras and Stotras) with the *Rik* and Sâman, for the Sadas is
Indra's own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:4">4:6:7:4</span></span>4. And by
means of these Ya*g*us they, as it were, bring forward (puras) that
Vish*n*u, the sacrifice: hence the name 'pura*sk*ara*n*a' (preparatory
ceremony).

<span id="page_437">p. 437</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:5">4:6:7:5</span></span>5. Both
the *Rik*s and the Sâmans are Speech, and the Ya*g*us are the Mind. Now
wherever this Speech was, there everything was done, everything was
known; but wherever Mind was, there nothing whatever was done, nothing
was known, for no one knows (understands) those who think in their mind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:6">4:6:7:6</span></span>6. The
gods said to Speech, 'Go thou forward and make this known!' She said,
'What will be my reward then?'--'Whatever in the sacrifice is offered
with Svâhâ, and without Vasha*t*, that shall be thine!' Hence whatever
in the sacrifice is offered with Svâhâ, and without Vasha*t*, that
belongs to Speech. She then went forward and made that known, saying,
'Do this so! do this so!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:7">4:6:7:7</span></span>7.
Therefore they also perform with the *Rik* in the Havirdhâna: he (the
Hot*ri*) recites the morning prayer, he recites the kindling-verses; he
(the Grâvastut) praises the pressing-stones,--for thus, indeed, they
(Speech and Mind) became yoke-fellows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:8">4:6:7:8</span></span>8. And
hence they also perform with the Ya*g*us in the Sadas: they raise up the
Udumbara post, they erect the Sadas, they throw up the dhish*n*ya
hearths,--for thus they became yoke-fellows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:9">4:6:7:9</span></span>9. That
same Sadas they enclose on all sides with a view to that generation,
thinking, 'Quite secretly shall be carried on that generation!' for
improper, indeed, is the generation which another sees hence even when a
husband and wife are seen, while carrying on intercourse, they run away
from each other, for they give offence. Therefore to any one looking
into the Sadas, except through the door, let him say, 'Look not!' for it
is as if he were seeing intercourse being carried on. Freely (one may
look) through the door, for the door is made by the gods.

<span id="page_438">p. 438</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:10">4:6:7:10</span></span>10. In
like manner they enclose the Havirdhâna on all sides with a view to that
generation, thinking, 'Quite secretly this generation shall be carried
on!' for improper, indeed, is the generation which another sees: hence
even when a husband and wife are seen, while carrying on intercourse,
they run away from each other, for they give offence. Therefore to any
one looking into the Havirdhâna, except through the door, let him say,
'Look not!' for it is as if he were seeing intercourse being carried on.
Freely (one may look) through the door, for the door is made by the
gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:11">4:6:7:11</span></span>11. Now
there, in the Sadas, that male, the Sâman, longs after the female, the
*Rik*. From that generation Indra was produced: from fire, indeed, fire
is produced, viz. Indra from the *Rik* and the Sâman; for Indra they
call him that burns yonder (the sun).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:12">4:6:7:12</span></span>12. And
there, in the Havirdhâna, that male, the Soma, longs after the female,
the water. From that generation the moon was produced: from food,
indeed, food is produced, viz. the moon from water and Soma; for the
moon is the food of him that burns yonder <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[1](#fn_1014.md). Hence he thereby produces the
sacrificer, and for him he produces food: from the *Rik* and Sâman he
produces the sacrificer, and from water and Soma he produces food for
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:13">4:6:7:13</span></span>13. Now
with the Ya*g*us the gods first performed sacrifice, then with the
*Rik*, then with the Sâman and in like manner do they now perform the
sacrifice. first with the Ya*g*us, then with the *Rik*, then with the
Sâman; for Ya*g*us, they say, is the same as Ya*g*as (worship).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:14">4:6:7:14</span></span>14. Now
when the gods milked (the objects of) their wishes from these sciences,
the Ya*g*us science

<span id="page_439">p. 439</span>

milked most wishes. It became, as it were, emptied the most; it was not
equal to the other two sciences,--the air-world was not equal to the two
other worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:15">4:6:7:15</span></span>15. The
gods desired, 'How can this science become equal to the other two
sciences; how can the air-world become equal to the two other worlds?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:16">4:6:7:16</span></span>16.
They said, 'Let us perform in a low voice with the Ya*g*us: then that
science will become equal to the other two sciences; then the air-world
will become equal to the two other worlds!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:17">4:6:7:17</span></span>17.
They performed with them in a low voice, and thereby strengthened them;
and henceforth that science was equal to the other two sciences, and the
air-world was equal to the two other worlds. Therefore the Ya*g*us,
while being distinct, are yet indistinct; and therefore the air-world,
while being distinct, is yet indistinct (indefinable).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:18">4:6:7:18</span></span>18. He
who performs with the Ya*g*us in a low voice, strengthens them; and
they, thus strengthened, strengthen him. But he who performs in a loud
voice, weakens them, and, being weak, they weaken him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:19">4:6:7:19</span></span>19. The
*Rik*s and Sâmans, forsooth, are speech, and the Ya*g*us are the mind;
and so those who perform with the *Rik* and Sâman are speech, and those
who perform with the Ya*g*us are the mind. Hence nothing whatever is
done, unless ordered by the Adhvaryu: when the Adhvaryu says, 'Recite
(the invitatory prayer)! Pronounce the offering prayer!' then those who
perform with the *Ri*k perform it. And when the Adhvaryu says, 'Soma
becometh pure: turn ye back <span id="fr_1021"></span>[1](#fn_1015.md)!'
then those who perform with the Sâman perform it,--for speech speaks not
but what is conceived by the mind.

<span id="page_440">p. 440</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:20">4:6:7:20</span></span>20.
Thus, then, the Adhvaryu, the mind, walks, as it were, in front
(pura*s*-*k*arati): hence the name 'pura*sk*ara*n*a <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[1](#fn_1016.md);' and verily, he who knows this,
stands, as it were, in front through prosperity and glory.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:7:21">4:6:7:21</span></span>21. Now
that same pura*sk*ara*n*a (going before) is nothing else than yonder
burning (sun): one ought to perform in accordance with his (the sun's)
course. When he (the Adhvaryu) has drawn a cup of Soma, let him turn
round in accordance with his course; when he has responded (to the
Hot*ri*'s recitation), let him turn round in accordance with his course;
when he has offered a graha, let him turn round in accordance with his
course: he (the sun), verily, is the supporter; and whosoever, knowing
this, is able to perform in accordance with his course, he, forsooth, is
able to support his dependants <span id="fr_1023"></span>[2](#fn_1017.md).
