#### THE AGNI-PRA*N*AYANA, OR LEADING FORWARD OF THE FIRE <span id="fr_323"></span>[1](#fn_321.md) TO THE HIGH ALTAR.

### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:1">3:5:2:1</span></span>1. They
put fire-wood on (the Âhavanîya fire), and prepare the underlayer (of
gravel <span id="fr_324"></span>[2](#fn_322)). He (the Adhvaryu.md) puts
the butter on (the Gârhapatya to melt), and cleans both the
dipping-spoon and the offering-spoon. Having then clarified the ghee, he
ladles five times thereof (into the offering-spoon). When the fire-wood
is ablaze-

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:2">3:5:2:2</span></span>2. They
lift the (burning) fire-wood, and place it on the underlayer <span
id="fr_325"></span>[3](#fn_323). Thereupon he says (to the Hot*ri*.md),
'Recite for Agni as he is taken forward <span
id="fr_326"></span>[4](#fn_324)!' (and to the Pratiprasthât*ri*.md), 'Come
up after me with the single sword(-line)!' The Pratiprasthât*ri* goes up
after him with the single sword(-line) as far

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

as that middle peg on the hind-part of the altar <span
id="fr_327"></span>[1](#fn_325.md): whatever part of the Gârhapatya <span
id="fr_328"></span>[2](#fn_326.md) is cut off from the altar by that
intermediate (peg), that he thereby carries on to (connects with) it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:3">3:5:2:3</span></span>3. Now
some walk up behind (and draw a line) as far as the high altar; but let
him not do that: let him walk up only as far as that middle peg. They
proceed and come up to the high altar <span
id="fr_329"></span>[3](#fn_327.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:4">3:5:2:4</span></span>4. The
Adhvaryu takes the sprinkling-water. He first sprinkles (the high altar)
in front, while standing (south of it) facing the north, with the text
(Vâ*g*. S. V, 11), 'May Indra's noise <span
id="fr_330"></span>[4](#fn_328.md) shield thee in front with the Vasus!'
whereby he means to say, 'May Indra's noise protect thee in front with
the Vasus.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:5">3:5:2:5</span></span>5. He
then sprinkles it behind with, 'May the Wise <span
id="fr_331"></span>[5](#fn_329.md) shield thee from behind with the
Rudras!' whereby he means to say, 'May the Wise One protect thee from
behind with the Rudras!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:6">3:5:2:6</span></span>6. He
then sprinkles on the right (south) side with, 'May the Thought-swift
shield thee with the Fathers on the right!' whereby he means

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

to say, 'May he swift as thought <span id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_330.md)
protect thee on the right with the Fathers!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:7">3:5:2:7</span></span>7. He
then sprinkles on the left side with, 'May Vi*s*vakarman (the
All-shaper) shield thee with the Âdityas on the left!' whereby he means
to say, 'May Vi*s*vakarman protect thee on the left with the Âdityas!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:8">3:5:2:8</span></span>8. The
sprinkling-water which is left he pours outside the altar close to where
is the southern of those two front corners (of the high altar) with,
'This burning water I dismiss from the sacrifice.' Because she
(Vâ*k*--the altar) on that occasion became a lioness and roamed about
unappeased <span id="fr_333"></span>[2](#fn_331.md), he thus dismisses from
the sacrifice that sorrow of hers,--if he do not wish to exorcise. But
should he wish to exorcise, let him indicate it by saying, 'This burning
water I dismiss from the sacrifice against so and so!' He then smites
him with that sorrow, and sorrowing he goes to yonder world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:9">3:5:2:9</span></span>9. Now as
to why he pours ghee on the high altar, while the fire is held (over
it). Because the gods said to her on that occasion, 'The offering shall
reach thee before Agni,' therefore the offering now does reach her
before (it reaches) Agni. And because she said to the gods, 'Whatsoever
blessing ye will invoke through me, all that shall be accomplished unto
you!' therefore the priests now invoke through her that blessing upon
the sacrificer, and it is fully accomplished unto him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:10">3:5:2:10</span></span>10.
When he pours ghee on the high altar, he

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

does it twofold even while doing it in one <span
id="fr_334"></span>[1](#fn_332.md). Now that which is the southern of the
two front corners of that navel, so to say, which is in the middle of
these (sides of the high altar)--

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:11">3:5:2:11</span></span>11. On
that <span id="fr_335"></span>[2](#fn_333.md) he pours ghee, with the text
(Vâ*g*. S. V, 12), 'Thou art a lioness; Hail!' Then on the northern of
the two back corners with, 'Thou art a lioness, winning the
Âdityas <span id="fr_336"></span>[3](#fn_334.md), Hail!' Then on the
southern of the two back corners with, 'Thou art a lioness, winning the
Brahman, winning the Kshatra, Hail!' Manifold, verily, is the prayer for
blessing in the sacrificial texts: by this one he prays <span
id="fr_337"></span>[4](#fn_335) for the Brahman (priesthood.md) and the
Kshatra. (nobility), those two vital forces.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:12">3:5:2:12</span></span>12.
Then on the northern of the front corners with, 'Thou art a lioness,
winning abundant offspring, winning growth of wealth, Hail!' In that he
says, 'winning abundant offspring,' he prays for offspring; and in that
he says, 'winning growth of wealth'--growth of wealth meaning
abundance--he prays for abundance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:13">3:5:2:13</span></span>13. He
then pours ghee into the middle with, 'Thou art a lioness, bring thou
hither the gods for the sacrificer! Hail!' whereby he causes the gods to
be brought to the sacrificer. He then raises the offering-spoon with,
'To the

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

beings thee! Hail!'--beings meaning offspring--he thereby means to say,
'To offspring thee!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:14">3:5:2:14</span></span>14. He
then lays the enclosing-sticks <span id="fr_338"></span>[1](#fn_336.md)
round (the navel); with the text (Vâ*g*. S. V, 13), 'Thou art firm,
steady thou the earth!' the middle one; with, 'Thou art firmly settled,
steady thou the air!' the right one; with, 'Thou art immovably settled,
steady thou the sky!' the left one. With, 'Thou art Agni's provision' he
throws the 'equipments' upon (the high altar). Wherefore are the
equipments?--for Agni's completeness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:15">3:5:2:15</span></span>15. The
pine-wood, namely, is his body <span id="fr_339"></span>[2](#fn_337.md):
hence in that there are enclosing-sticks of pine-wood, thereby he
supplies him with a body, makes him whole.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:16">3:5:2:16</span></span>16. And
the bdellium, forsooth, is his flesh: hence in that there is bdellium,
thereby he supplies him with flesh, makes him whole.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:17">3:5:2:17</span></span>17. And
the fragrant reed-grass (sugandhi-te*g*ana), forsooth, is his fragrance:
hence in that there is fragrant reed-grass, thereby he supplies him with
fragrance, makes him whole.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:2:18">3:5:2:18</span></span>18. And
as to why there is a wether's hair-tuft,--Agni, forsooth, dwelt once for
one night between the two horns of a wether: 'Whatever of Agni's nature
is inherent therein, let that be here too,' so he thinks, and therefore
there is a wether's hair-tuft. Let him, therefore, cut off that (tuft)
which is nearest to the head, and bring it; and if he be unable to
procure that, let him bring any kind (of wether's hair). And why there
are enclosing-sticks?--for the

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

protection (of Agni): for it is somewhat long before the next
enclosing-sticks will come nigh to him <span
id="fr_340"></span>[1](#fn_338.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_321"></span>[121:1](sbe2620.htm#fr_323.md) The transferring of
the Âhavanîya fire to the high altar takes place in the forenoon of the
last Upasad day (that is, on the day preceding the pressing day, and
called upavasatha, or preparation day). It is preceded by the double or
combined performance of the Upasad offerings (one of which took place in
the afternoon on the two preceding days).

<span id="fn_322"></span>[121:2](sbe2620.htm#fr_324.md) Some gravel is put
in a pan for the burning wood to lie upon, when it is to be transferred
from the Âhavanîya to the new altar. The Taittirîyas mix with the gravel
one-fourth part of the dust of the foot-print of the Soma-cow ([III, 3,
1, 6](sbe2611.htm#3:3:1:6).md), the other three parts being used
respectively for anointing the axle of the Soma-cart ([III, 5, 3,
13](sbe2621.htm#3:5:3:13).md), for the underlayer of the Âgnîdhra fire
([III, 6, 3, 4](sbe2625.htm#3:6:3:4).md), and for scattering about behind
the Gârhapatya ([III, 6, 3,
4](sbe2625.htm#3:6:3:4)-[7](sbe2625.htm#3:6:3:7).md).

<span id="fn_323"></span>[121:3](sbe2620.htm#fr_325.md) Lit. they lift the
underlayer underneath (the burning wood).

<span id="fn_324"></span>[121:4](sbe2620.htm#fr_326.md) For the eight
verses (or twelve, the first and last being recited thrice each) which
the Hot*ri* has to repeat while the fire is carried eastward and laid
down on the high altar, see Ait. Br. I, 28; Â*s*v. Sr. II, 17. For the
Brahman's duties, see Kâty. XI, 1, 9.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[122:1](sbe2620.htm#fr_327.md) See [III, 5, 1,
1](sbe2619.htm#3:5:1:1.md).

<span id="fn_326"></span>[122:2](sbe2620.htm#fr_328.md) The Âhavanîya or
offering fire being now transferred to the new altar, the old Âhavanîya
hearth is henceforward used as Gârhapatya; and a line is drawn from it
up to the anta*h*pâta, marking the middle of the west side of the great
altar.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[122:3](sbe2620.htm#fr_329.md) In 'leading
forwards' the fire they proceed along the north side of the large altar.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[122:4](sbe2620.htm#fr_330.md) Indraghoshá,
perhaps 'India's name;' Mahîdhara and Sâya*n*a take it as 'he who is
noised abroad as Indra' (i.e. called Indra), which, however, would
require the accent 'índraghosha.' Perhaps 'the noise of Indra' means
Agni, the roaring fire: for Agni and the Vasus, see [III, 4, 2,
1](sbe2616.htm#3:4:2:1.md).

<span id="fn_329"></span>[122:5](sbe2620.htm#fr_331.md) Pra*k*etas, here
Varu*n*a according to Mahîdhara and Sâya*n*a. Cf. [III, 4, 2,
1](sbe2616.htm#3:4:2:1.md).

<span id="fn_330"></span>[123:1](sbe2620.htm#fr_332.md) 'Mano*g*avas' is
taken by Mahîdhara and Sâya*n*a as referring to Yama.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[123:2](sbe2620.htm#fr_333.md) '*S*o*k*antî
(sorrowing),' Kâ*n*va rec.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[124:1](sbe2620.htm#fr_334.md) Viz. by pouring the
ghee cross-wise on the corners of the 'navel' of the altar.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[124:2](sbe2620.htm#fr_335.md) The south-east is
sacred to Agni, the north-west to Vâyu.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[124:3](sbe2620.htm#fr_336.md) Because the Âdityas
brought her as a Dakshi*n*â, Kâ*n*va rec.; cf. [III, 5, 1,
18](sbe2619.htm#3:5:1:18.md).

<span id="fn_335"></span>[124:4](sbe2620.htm#fr_337.md) But for the lack of
a demonstrative pronoun with â*s*î*h* one would like to take the passage
thus: 'Plenteous, forsooth, is this prayer for blessing among
sacrificial texts: he thereby prays for the priesthood and the
nobility.' Cf. I, 2, 1, 7.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[125:1](sbe2620.htm#fr_338.md) They are of
pîtudâru (Pinus Deodora) wood, a span (of thumb and fore-finger) long.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[125:2](sbe2620.htm#fr_339.md) The Kâ*n*va text
makes it his bones.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[126:1](sbe2620.htm#fr_340.md) Ordinarily the
laying round of the paridhis takes place immediately before the fire is
kindled for the offering; but as the next offering is not to come off
for some time, the fire would be without a protection, if he were to
leave it without the enclosing-sticks. Sâya*n*a takes 'dûre' in the
sense of 'in a long time,' as above; but it might be taken of space 'far
off,' when the passage would refer to the offering about to be performed
on the old Âhavanîya ([III, 5, 3, 10](sbe2621.htm#3:5:3:10) seq..md); and
it may be noticed in reference to this point, that, according to Kâty.
VIII, 3, 30, that fire does not become the Gârhapatya till immediately
after that offering.
