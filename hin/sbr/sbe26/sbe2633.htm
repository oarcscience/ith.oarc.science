For the same deity for which there is a victim, he subsequently prepares a sacrificial cake&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. The reason why he subsequently prepares a cake is this. Rice and barley, truly, are the sacrificial essence of all animals (victims)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; with that same essence he now completes that (victim) and makes it whole. This is why he subsequently prepares a sacrificial cake.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:2">3:8:3:2</A></FONT></span>2. And why he proceeds with that cake after performing (offering) with the omentum is this. It is from the middle (of the victim) that this omentum is pulled out, and from the middle he now completes that (victim) by means of that sacrificial essence and makes it whole; therefore he proceeds with that cake after performing with the omentum. The relation of</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_200"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 200</FONT></A></p>  
<p>this (cake to the animal offering), indeed, is one and the same everywhere; that cake is prepared after (and supplementary to) a victim.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:3">3:8:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. Thereupon he cuts up the victim: 'Move thrice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_500"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and make the heart the uppermost of the thrice-moved!' thus (he says to the slaughterer), for threefold is the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:4">3:8:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. He then instructs the slaughterer: 'If one ask thee, "Is the sacrificial food cooked, O <I>S</I>amitar?" say thou only "Cooked!" not "Cooked, reverend sir!" nor "Cooked, forsooth!"'</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:5">3:8:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. Having then taken clotted ghee with the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;, the Adhvaryu, stepping up (from the altar) to (the <I>S</I>&acirc;mitra), asks, 'Is the sacrificial food cooked, O <I>S</I>&acirc;mitar?' 'Cooked,' he says. 'That is of the gods,' says the Adhvaryu in a low voice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:6">3:8:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. The reason why he asks is this. Cooked, forsooth, not uncooked (must be) the gods' food; and the <I>S</I>amit<I>ri</I> indeed knows whether it is cooked or uncooked.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:7">3:8:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. And again, why he asks. 'I will perform with cooked (food),' so he thinks; and if that sacrificial food be uncooked, it is yet cooked food for the gods, and is cooked as regards the Sacrificer; and the Adhvaryu is guiltless; on the slaughterer that guilt lies. Thrice he asks, for threefold is the sacrifice. And as to his saying, 'That is of the gods,' that which is cooked, indeed, belongs to the gods; therefore he says, 'That is of the gods.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:8">3:8:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. The heart he bastes (with clotted ghee) first of all; for the heart is the self (soul), the mind; and the clotted ghee is the breath; he thus puts the breath into its (the victim's) self, into its mind; and thus it verily becomes the living food of the gods, and immortal for the immortals.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:9">3:8:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. He bastes it with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 18), 'May thy mind unite with the mind; thy breath with the breath!' He utters no Sv&acirc;h&acirc; ('hail'), for this is not an oblation. They remove the victim (from the cooking-fire)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:10">3:8:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. 'They take it along the back of the pit, and</p>

<p><A NAME="page_202"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 202</FONT></A></p>  
<p>between the sacrificial stake and the (&Acirc;havan&icirc;ya) fire. The reason why, though it is cooked, they do not take it across the middle (of the altar), as they take other sacrificial dishes, is 'lest they should bring the sacrifice in the middle in connection with that which is cut up by limbs and mangled.' And why they do not take it outside (the altar) in front of the stake, is that they would thereby put it outside the sacrifice: therefore they take (the flesh) along between the stake and the fire. When they have put it down south (of the fire), the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> cuts off (the portions). There are Plaksha branches&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (Ficus Infectoria) by way of an upper barhis (covering of altar); thereon he cuts. The reason why there are Plaksha branches by way of an upper barhis is this.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:11">3:8:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. For when the gods, at first, seized an animal to sacrifice), Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I> first spat upon its head, thinking, 'Surely, thus they will not touch it!' for animals belong to Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>. That (spittle became) the brain in the head and the marrow in the neck-bone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: hence that (substance) is like spittle, for Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I> spat it. Let him therefore not eat that, since it was spitten by Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:12">3:8:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. Its sacrificial essence flowed down and there a tree sprang up. The gods beheld it; wherefore it (was called) 'prakhya' (visible), for 'plaksha,'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_203"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 203</FONT></A></p>  
<p>doubtless, is the same as 'prakhya.' With that same sacrificial essence he now completes it (the victim), and makes it whole: hence there are Plaksha branches as an upper covering.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:13">3:8:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. He then makes an 'underlayer' of ghee both in the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; and the upabh<I>ri</I>t, and in the vas&acirc;homahavan&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and the samavattadh&acirc;n&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and puts a piece of gold&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> both in the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; and the upabh<I>ri</I>t.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:14">3:8:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. Thereupon he addresses (the Hot<I>ri</I>) for the recitation on the havis to the manot&acirc; deity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. The reason why he addresses him for the recitation on the havis to the manot&acirc; deity is this. All the deities draw nigh to the victim while it is immolated, thinking, 'My name he will choose, my name he will choose!' for the animal victim is sacrificial food for all deities. The minds (manas), then, of all those deities are, fixed upon (ota) that victim; those (minds of theirs) he thereby satisfies, and thus the minds of the gods have not drawn nigh in vain. For this reason he addresses him for the recitation on the havis to the manot&acirc; deity.</p>

He first makes a portion of the heart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The reason why he first makes a portion of the heart which is in the middle, is that the heart is the breath, since it is from there that this breath moves upward&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_509"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and the animal is breath, for only so long does the animal (live) as it breathes with the breath; but when the breath departs from it, it lies there useless, even (as) a block of wood.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:16">3:8:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. The heart, then, is the animal; thus he first makes a portion of its very self (or soul). And, accordingly, if any portion were omitted, he need not heed this, since it is of his entire animal victim that the first portion is made which is made of the heart. He therefore first makes a portion of the heart, that being in the middle. Thereupon according to the proper order.</p>

Then of the simultaneously moving (left) fore-foot&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_513"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Then of the flanks. Then of the liver. Then of the kidneys.</p>

<p>trya&#7749;ga&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_515"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Then of the simultaneously moving (right) haunch&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_516"></A><A HREF="#fn_514"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. This much, then, he cuts into the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:19">3:8:3:19</A></FONT></span>19. Then into the upabh<I>ri</I>t, he makes a portion of the upper part of the fore-foot belonging to the trya&#7749;ga (viz. the right one); of the (narrow piece of the) hind-part, after dividing it in two; and of the haunch belonging to the trya&#7749;ga (viz. the left). Thereupon he puts two pieces of gold on (the flesh oblations in the spoons) and pours ghee thereon.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:20">3:8:3:20</A></FONT></span>20. He then takes the oblation of gravy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 18), 'Thou art trembling,' for quivering, as it were, is the broth: hence he says, 'Thou art trembling;'--'May Agni prepare&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_518"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> thee!' for the fire does indeed cook it: hence he says, 'May Agni prepare thee!'--'The waters have washed thee together,' for the water indeed gathers together that (fat) juice from the limbs: hence he says, 'The waters have washed thee together.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:21">3:8:3:21</A></FONT></span>21. 'For the sweeping of the wind--thee!' for verily yonder blower sweeps along the air, and for the air he takes it: hence he says, 'For the sweeping of the wind (I take) thee.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:22">3:8:3:22</A></FONT></span>22.

'From the hot vapour may totter--;' the hot vapour, namely, is yonder (wind), and for that he takes it: hence he says, 'From the hot vapour may totter--.' Thereupon he bastes it twice with ghee above.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:24">3:8:3:24</A></FONT></span>24. He then mixes it either with the crooked knife or with the chopping-knife&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_520"></A><A HREF="#fn_518"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with '--Confounded hatred&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_521"></A><A HREF="#fn_519"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!' whereby he chases away from here those evil spirits, the Rakshas.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:25">3:8:3:25</A></FONT></span>25. The broth which is left he pours into the Samavattadh&acirc;n&icirc;, and therein he throws the heart, tongue, breast, the broad piece (of the back part), the kidneys, and the rectum. He then bastes it twice with ghee above.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:26">3:8:3:26</A></FONT></span>26. The reason why there is a piece of gold on each side is this. When they offer up the victim in the fire, they slay it, and gold means immortal life: thereby then it rests in immortal life; and so it rises from hence, and so it lives. This is why there is a piece of gold on each side.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:27">3:8:3:27</A></FONT></span>27. And because he cuts crossways,--of the left fore-foot and the right haunch; and of the right forefoot and the left haunch,--therefore this animal draws forward its feet crossways. But were he to cut straight on, this animal would draw forward its feet (of the same side) simultaneously: therefore he cuts crossways. Then as to why he does not make cuttings of the head, nor the shoulders, nor the neck, nor the hind-thighs.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:28">3:8:3:28</A></FONT></span>28. Now the Asuras, in the beginning, seized a victim. The gods, from fear, did not go near it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_522"></A><A HREF="#fn_520"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The Earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_523"></A><A HREF="#fn_521"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> then said unto them, 'Heed ye not this: I will myself be an eye-witness thereof, in whatsoever manner they will perform this (offering).'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:29">3:8:3:29</A></FONT></span>29. She said, 'Only one oblation have they offered, the other they have left over.' Now that which they left over are these same portions. Thereupon the gods made over three limbs to (Agni) Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t, whence the Trya&#7749;ga oblations. The Asuras then made portions of the head, the shoulders, the neck, and the hind-thighs: therefore let him not make portions of these. And since Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I> spat upon the neck, therefore let him not make a portion of the neck. Thereupon he says (to the Hot<I>ri</I>), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Agni and Soma for the havis of the buck!' Having called for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>, he says (to the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a), 'Prompt (the Hot<I>ri</I> to recite the offering-prayer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_524"></A><A HREF="#fn_522"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> for) the havis of the buck to Agni and Soma!' He does not say '(the havis) made ready:' when the Soma has been pressed he says 'made ready.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:30">3:8:3:30</A></FONT></span>30. In the interval between the two half-verses of the offering-prayer he offers the oblation of gravy. It is from out of this that that essence (juice) has risen upwards here,--that sap of this earth whereby creatures exist on this side of the sky&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_525"></A><A HREF="#fn_523"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; for the</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_208"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 208</FONT></A></p>  
<p>oblation of gravy is sap, and essence is sap: thus he renders the sap strong by means of sap, whence this sap when eaten does not perish.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:31">3:8:3:31</A></FONT></span>31. And as to why he offers the oblation of gravy in the interval between the two half-verses of the offering-prayer,--one half-verse, forsooth, is this earth, and the other half-verse is yonder sky. Now between the sky and the earth is the air, and it is to the air that he offers: therefore he offers the oblation of gravy between the two half-verses of the offering-prayer.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:32">3:8:3:32</A></FONT></span>32. He offers with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 19), 'Drink the ghee, ye drinkers of ghee! Drink the gravy, ye drinkers of gravy! thou art the havis of the air, Hail!' With this prayer to the All-gods he offers, for the air belongs to the All-gods: because creatures move about here in the air breathing in and breathing out therewith, therefore it belongs to the All-gods. As the Vasha<I>t</I> (of the offering-prayer for the meat portions) is pronounced, he offers the portions that are in the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:33">3:8:3:33</A></FONT></span>33. Thereupon, while taking clotted ghee with the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;, he says (to the Hot<I>ri</I>), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the Lord of the forest!' Having called for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>, he says (to the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a), 'Prompt (the Hot<I>ri</I> to recite the offering-prayer) to the lord of the forest!' and offers, as the Vasha<I>t</I> is pronounced&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_524"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The reason why he offers to the lord of the forest (the tree) is,--he thereby makes that thunderbolt, the sacrificial stake, a sharer (in the sacrifice); and, the lord of the forest being Soma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_527"></A><A HREF="#fn_525"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_209"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 209</FONT></A></p>  
<p>he thereby makes the victim to be Soma. And as to his offering (to the tree) between the two oblations, he thus fills both completely: therefore he offers between the two oblations.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:34">3:8:3:34</A></FONT></span>34. Thereupon, while pouring together the meat portions that are for the upabh<I>ri</I>t, he says (to the Hot<I>ri</I>), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t (the maker of good offering)!' Having called for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>, he says (to the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a), 'Prompt for Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t!' and offers as the Vasha<I>t</I> is pronounced.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:35">3:8:3:35</A></FONT></span>35. With what is left of the offering of gravy, he then sprinkles the quarters, with, 'The regions,--the fore-regions,--the by-regions,--the intermediate regions,--the upper regions,--to the regions, Hail!' For the offering of gravy is sap: thus he imbues all the regions with sap, and hence sap is obtained here on earth in every region.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:8:3:36">3:8:3:36</A></FONT></span>36. Thereupon he touches (what remains of) the victim&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_528"></A><A HREF="#fn_526"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: now is the time for the touching.

Where it has been cut up limb by limb, there he heals it by means of the out-breathing and in-breathing.--'O divine Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>, let thine ample (forms) closely unite together, that it be uniform what is of different shape:' whereby he makes it completely enclosed (in its limbs and flesh). 'May thy friends, thy father and mother&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_531"></A><A HREF="#fn_529"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, to please thee, joyfully welcome thee going to the gods!' Thus, having made it whole wherever he has offered (a piece of) it, he afterwards unites it firmly, and that body (self) of it is complete in yonder world.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_498"></A><A HREF="sbe2633.htm#fr_500">199:2</A> The technical name of this cake to Indra and Agni is pa<I>s</I>u-purod&acirc;<I>s</I>a (animal-cake). The anuv&acirc;ky&acirc; and y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; for the chief oblation, are Rig-veda I, 93, 2 and 6 respectively; for the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t, III, I, 23, and III, 54, 22; Adv. III, 8, 1; 5, 9. For a similar performance, described in detail, see note on III, 2, 5, 22.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_499"></A><A HREF="sbe2633.htm#fr_501">199:3</A> On the sacrificial essence passing successively from man into the horse, the ox, the goat, and finally into the rice and barley, see I, 2, 3, 6-7.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_500"></A><A HREF="sbe2633.htm#fr_502">200:1</A> The order of proceeding is not quite clear from the context, and seems to have puzzled the later ritualists. From K&acirc;ty. VI, 7-8 it would seem that the author of the S&ucirc;tras means the performance of the cake-offering to go on simultaneously with the cutting up of the victim (and the cooking of the portions and roasting of the beast). The comm. on K&acirc;ty. VI, 7, 29, however, protests against this arrangement as contrary to the order laid down in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a; and insists especially on the 'atha (now)' at the beginning of this paragraph. This particle is, however, often used in a vague sense; as very frequently when, after sketching the chief course of performance, the author turns back to fill in the details. There seems also a difference of opinion as to the exact meaning of the above direction given by the Adhvaryu to the Samitar after (as would seem) the portions have been cooked. The commentator on K&acirc;ty. VI, 8, 1 apparently takes 'tri<I>h</I> pra<I>k</I>y&acirc;vaya' in the sense of 'shake thrice' or 'turn thrice.' S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, on the other hand, explains it as meaning that the <I>S</I>amit<I>ri</I> is to divide the portions into three parts, according to whether they are destined for the chief offerings, or the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t, or the by-offerings (?). As the direction cannot refer to the taking out of the portions from the cooking-vessel (ukh&acirc;) it would seem that the <I>S</I>amitar is either to move (shake) the vessel itself, or to stir the contents, perhaps hereby separating the respective portions. The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text reads, Tri<I>h</I> pra<I>k</I>y&acirc;vay&acirc;d ity uttame pra<I>k</I>y&acirc;va uttam&acirc;rdhe h<I>ri</I>daya<I>m</I> kurut&acirc;d iti. The heart, when done, is to be removed from the spit and laid on the portions; whereupon the Adhvaryu pours ghee on the portions (<a href="sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:8">paragraph 8</A>).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_501"></A><A HREF="sbe2633.htm#fr_503">201:1</A> The Adhvaryu removes the dish northwards from the fire, takes the portions out of it, puts them into some kind of basket, and performs 'pr&acirc;<I>n</I>ad&acirc;na' (<A HREF="sbe2632.htm#page_196">p. 196</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2632.htm#fn_488">3</A>) on them.</P>
