Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, forsooth, is that sacrifice which is performed here, and from which these creatures have been produced: and in like manner are they produced thereafter even to this day.</p>

And because of those two (cups) which are together he offers the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u first, therefore, of goats and sheep when they are together&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_950"></A><A HREF="#fn_944"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the goats go first, and the sheep behind them.</p>

And because, having offered the Antary&acirc;ma, he wipes (the vessel) downwards, therefore these sheep walk with their heads down, as if digging. Now they, the goats and sheep, are most conspicuously Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati-like: whence, bringing forth thrice in the year, they produce two or three&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_952"></A><A HREF="#fn_946"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (young ones).</p>

After&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_953"></A><A HREF="#fn_947"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> the <I>S</I>ukra cup men are produced. Now that (cup) is again employed at the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again. But the <I>S</I>ukra (bright) is the same as he that burns yonder, and he indeed is Indra; and of animals, man is Indra-like&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_954"></A><A HREF="#fn_948"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>: whence he rules over animals.</p>

Now that (cup) is again employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again. And such-like is the Ritu cup&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_955"></A><A HREF="#fn_949"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and suchlike the head of the one-hoofed. The &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a</p>

<p>cup, the Ukthya cup, and the &Acirc;ditya cup,--after them cows are produced. Now, these are again employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:5:9">4:5:5:9</A></FONT></span>9. And because goats are produced after the fewest cups, therefore, though bringing forth thrice in a year, producing two or three, (they are) very few, for they are produced after the fewest cups.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:5:10">4:5:5:10</A></FONT></span>10. And because cows are produced after the most cups, therefore, though bringing forth once in a year, and producing one each time, (they are) most numerous, for they are produced after the most cups.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:5:11">4:5:5:11</A></FONT></span>11. Then, in the Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a (trough) he finally draws the H&acirc;riyo<I>g</I>ana graha. Now, the Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati;--he turns unto these creatures, and fosters them, and kisses them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_956"></A><A HREF="#fn_950"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: he fosters them in that he produces them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:5:12">4:5:5:12</A></FONT></span>12. Now, these same cups after which creatures are produced, are five,--those of the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u and Antary&acirc;ma (counting as) one and the same, the <I>S</I>ukra cup, the <I>Ri</I>tu cup, the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a cup, and the Ukthya cup; for there are five seasons in the year, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the year, and the sacrifice is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. But if there be six seasons in the year, then the &Acirc;ditya cup is the sixth of them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:5:13">4:5:5:13</A></FONT></span>13. But indeed there is only that one cup after which creatures are produced here, to wit, the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u cup; for the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u is breath, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is breath, and everything here is after Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.</p>
