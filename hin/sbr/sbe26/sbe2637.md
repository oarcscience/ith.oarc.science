#### THE VASATÎVARÎ WATER.

### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:1">3:9:2:1</span></span>1. Now,
when the head of the sacrifice (victim) was struck off, its sap,
running, entered the waters. It is by that very sap that those waters
flow; that very sap is believed to be flowing there <span
id="fr_556"></span>[1](#fn_554).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:2">3:9:2:2</span></span>2. And
when he goes for the Vasatîvarî water, he fetches that same sap and puts
it into the sacrifice, and makes the sacrifice sapful; this is why he
goes for the Vasatîvarî water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:3">3:9:2:3</span></span>3. He
distributes it over all the Savanas (Soma-pressings) <span
id="fr_557"></span>[2](#fn_555); thereby he imbues all the pressings

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

with that sap, makes all the pressings sapful: this is why he
distributes it over all the pressings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:4">3:9:2:4</span></span>4. Let
him take it from flowing (water); for that sap of the sacrifice was
moving <span id="fr_558"></span>[1](#fn_556): let him therefore take it
from flowing (water).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:5">3:9:2:5</span></span>5.
Moreover, it is taken for the purpose of protection. Now, everything
else here on earth, whatever it be, takes rest, even yonder blowing
(wind); but these (waters) alone take no rest: therefore let him take it
from flowing (water).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:6">3:9:2:6</span></span>6. Let
him take it by day, thinking, 'Seeing, I will take the sap of the
sacrifice <span id="fr_559"></span>[2](#fn_557):' therefore let him take
it by day. For it is for him that burns yonder (the sun) that he takes
it, since he takes it for all the gods, and all the gods are his rays of
light: therefore let him take it by day. For it is by day alone that he
(shines): therefore, then, let him take it by day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:7">3:9:2:7</span></span>7. And
again, all the gods, forsooth, now come to the sacrificer's house; and
if one takes the Vasatîvarî water before the setting of the sun, it is
as when one's better comes to visit one, he would honour him by trimming
his house. They draw nigh to that sacrificial food, and abide (upa-vas)
in that Vasatîvarî <span id="fr_560"></span>[3](#fn_558) water,--that is
the Upavasatha (preparation-day).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:8">3:9:2:8</span></span>8. And if
the sun were to set on any one's (Vasatîvarîs) not having been taken,
then expiation is made. If he have performed a (Soma-)sacrifice before
this, let him (the Adhvaryu) take it from his tank <span
id="fr_561"></span>[4](#fn_559), since

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

that (water) of his has been taken before (sunset) by day. But should he
not have offered before, if there be one who has offered (Soma) settled
close by or somewhere thereabout <span id="fr_562"></span>[1](#fn_560),
let him take it from his tank, since that (water) of his has been taken
before, by day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:9">3:9:2:9</span></span>9. But if
he cannot obtain either kind (of water), let him seize a firebrand and
betake himself (to the flowing water), and let him take thereof while
holding that (firebrand) close above it; or let him take it while
holding a piece of gold close above it: thus it is made like yonder
burning (sun).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:10">3:9:2:10</span></span>10. He
takes therefrom with the text (V4;. S. VI, 23), 'Rich in havis are these
waters,'--for the sap of the sacrifice entered into them, wherefore he
says, 'Rich in havis (sacrificial food) are these waters;'--'One rich in
havis wooeth for (them),' for the sacrificer, rich in havis, woos for
(wishes to obtain) them; wherefore he says, 'One rich in havis wooeth
for (them).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:11">3:9:2:11</span></span>11.
'Rich in havis (may be) the divine cult;' cult, namely, means the
sacrifice; thus he makes the sacrifice for which he takes it rich in
sacrificial food, therefore he says, 'Rich in havis is the divine cult.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:12">3:9:2:12</span></span>12.
'May Sûrya be rich in havis!' For he takes it for yonder burning (sun),
since he takes it for all the gods, and all the gods are his (the sun's)
rays of light; therefore he says, 'May Sûrya (the sun) be rich in
havis!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:13">3:9:2:13</span></span>13.
Having fetched it, he deposits it behind the Gârhapatya <span
id="fr_563"></span>[2](#fn_561), with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 24), 'I seat you in

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

the seat of Agni, the safe-housed;' whereby he means to say, 'I seat you
(waters) in the seat of Agni, whose house is unimpaired.' And when the
animal offering to Agni and Soma comes to a close, then he carries (the
Vasatîvarî water) round. He says (thrice), 'Disperse!' The sacrificer is
seated in front of the Soma-carts (holding Soma on his lap <span
id="fr_564"></span>[1](#fn_562)). He (the Adhvaryu) takes it (the water
standing behind the Gârhapatya).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:14">3:9:2:14</span></span>14. He
walks out (of the hall) by the south (door), and puts it down on the
south hip (of the high altar), with, 'Ye (waters) are Indra and Agni's
share!' for he takes it for all the gods, and Indra and Agni are all the
gods. He takes it up again and puts it down in front of the lady (who,
seated behind the Gârhapatya, touches the water-jar). Walking round
behind the lady he (again) takes it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:15">3:9:2:15</span></span>15. He
walks out (of the hall by the east door), along the north side (of the
altar), and puts down (the water) on the north hip (of the high altar),
with, 'Ye are Mitra and Varu*n*a's share!' Let him not put it down in
this way <span id="fr_565"></span>[2](#fn_563) that is redundant, and no
fitting conclusion is thus attained. Let him rather (here also) say, 'Ye
are Indra and Agni's share!' only thus there is nothing redundant, and
so a fitting conclusion is obtained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:16">3:9:2:16</span></span>16.
That (Vasatîvarî water) is carried round for the sake of protection;
Agni is in front (of the sacrificial ground), and now that (water) moves
about all round, repelling the evil spirits. He puts it

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

down in the Âgnîdhra (fire-house) with, 'Ye are all the gods' share!'
whereby he makes all the gods enter it. It is a desirable object (vara)
to the dwellers (vasat), hence the name Vasatîvarî <span
id="fr_566"></span>[1](#fn_564), and verily he who knows this, becomes a
desirable object to the dwellers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:9:2:17">3:9:2:17</span></span>17. Now
there are here seven formulas; with four he takes (the water), with one
he puts it down behind the Gârhapatya, with one he carries it round,
with one (he puts it down) in the Âgnîdhra,--this makes seven. For when
the metres were produced from Vâ*k* (speech), the one consisting of
seven feet, the *S*akvarî, was the last (highest) of them;--that
completeness (he brings about): hence there are seven formulas.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[223:3](sbe2637.htm#fr_560) 'Vasatîvarî' seems
