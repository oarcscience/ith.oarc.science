### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:2:1">3:7:2:1</span></span>1.
Verily, as large as the altar is, so large is the earth. The sacrificial
stakes are thunderbolts; and by means of these thunderbolts he obtains
possession of this earth, and excludes his enemies from sharing therein.
Hence there are eleven stakes, and the twelfth lies aside rough-hewn; he
puts it down south (of the altar). The reason why the twelfth lies aside
is this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:2:2">3:7:2:2</span></span>2. Now
the gods, while performing this sacrifice,

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. Those raised
(sacrificial stakes), then, were as a discharged arrow,--therewith one
either smites or smites not; as a hurled club,--therewith one either
smites or smites not. But that twelfth (stake) lying aside,--even as an
arrow drawn but not discharged, as (a weapon) raised but not hurled, so
was that a thunderbolt raised for repelling the evil spirits on the
south; therefore the twelfth (stake) lies aside.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:2:3">3:7:2:3</span></span>3. He
lays it down with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 6), 'This is thy place on earth; thine
is the beast of the forest.' There are the animal (victim) and the
sacrificial stake; to this one he thereby assigns of animals that of the
forest, and thus it, too, is possessed of an animal (victim). That
setting up of the eleven sacrificial stakes is said to be of two
kinds,--some, namely, set (them all) up (on the previous day) for the
morrow's Soma feast, and others set up (one) stake for the
preparation <span id="fr_454"></span>[1](#fn_452.md) of the morrow's Soma
feast.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:2:4">3:7:2:4</span></span>4. Let
him, however, not do this; but let him only set up the one opposite the
fire. For after setting it up the Adhvaryu does not quit his hold of it
till the girding; but those (others) remain

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

ungirt during that night. Thus there would be an offence, since it is
for the victim that the stake is set up, and the victim is (only)
slaughtered on the next morning: let him therefore set up (the others)
on the next morning.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:2:5">3:7:2:5</span></span>5. Let
him first set up that (stake) which stands (immediately) north of the
one opposite the fire, then the one on the south, then a northern
one,--last of all the one on the southern flank: thus it (the row of
stakes) inclines to the north.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:2:6">3:7:2:6</span></span>6. But
they also say conversely <span id="fr_455"></span>[1](#fn_453.md), 'Let him
first set up that which is south of the one opposite the fire, then the
northern one, then a southern one,--last of all the one on the northern
flank: and thus indeed his work attains completion towards the north.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:2:7">3:7:2:7</span></span>7. Let
the largest be the one forming the southern flank; then shorter and
shorter; and the one forming the northern flank the shortest: thus (the
row of stakes) inclines to the north.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:2:8">3:7:2:8</span></span>8.
Thereupon they set up the wife-stake for the wives. It is for the sake
of completeness, forsooth, that the wife-stake is set up: there they
seize (and bind) the victim for Tvash*tri*, for Tvash*tri* fashions the
cast seed, and hence he fashions the seed now cast. It (the victim to
Tvash*tri*) is an animal with testicles, for such a one is a begetter.
Let him not slay that one, but let him set it free after fire has been
carried round it. Were he to slay it, there would assuredly be an end to
offspring, but in this way he sets free the offspring. Therefore let him
not

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

slay it, but let him set it free after fire has been carried round it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_452"></span>[176:1](sbe2628.htm#fr_454.md) No satisfactory
explanation of 'prakubratâ' occurs to me. It seems to he derived from
'kubra,' to which the dictionaries assign the meanings 'hole for
sacrificial fire' and 'thread' (besides those of 'forest,' 'earring,'
and 'cart'). U*n*âd. II, 28, derives this from a root 'kub,' to cover,
shelter. ? For the safe foundation (or the protraction) of to-morrow's
Soma feast. The Kâ*n*va text, on the other hand, reads: 'Some, now,
raise all (the stakes) on the upavasatha (day before the Soma feast) for
the sake of quickening (?prakudratâyai) the work, thinking, 'we will
quickly bring the sacrifice to a close.'

<span id="fn_453"></span>[177:1](sbe2628.htm#fr_455.md) The Kâ*n*va text
first mentions the practice set forth in the preceding paragraph, as the
teaching of 'some,' but then rejects it in favour of the second
alternative.
