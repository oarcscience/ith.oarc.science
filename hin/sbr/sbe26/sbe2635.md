### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:5:1">3:8:5:1</span></span>1. He
makes the additional by-offerings:--with 'Go thou to the sacrifice <span
id="fr_539"></span>[2](#fn_537.md), Hail!' The sacrifice is water, and seed
is water: he thus casts seed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:5:2">3:8:5:2</span></span>2. 'Go
thou to Soma, Hail!' Soma is seed: he thus casts seed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:5:3">3:8:5:3</span></span>3. 'Go
thou to the heavenly ether, Hail!' The heavenly ether is water, and seed
is water: he thus casts seed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:5:4">3:8:5:4</span></span>4. 'Go
thou to Agni Vai*s*vânara, Hail!' Agni Vai*s*vânara ('belonging to all
men') is this earth, and she is a safe resting-place: upon that safe
resting-place he thus produces (creatures).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:5:5">3:8:5:5</span></span>5. He
then touches his mouth, with, 'Give me mind and heart!' thus indeed the
by-offerer does not throw himself after (the oblations into the fire).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:5:6">3:8:5:6</span></span>6.
Thereupon <span id="fr_540"></span>[3](#fn_538.md) they perform the
Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

with the tail (of the victim), for the tail is the hind-part, and from
the hind-part of woman offspring is produced: hence offspring is
produced by the Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as being performed with the tail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:5:7">3:8:5:7</span></span>7. For
the wives of the gods he cuts portions from the inside, since it is from
the inside of woman that offspring is produced; for Agni the householder
from above, since it is from above that the male approaches the female.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:5:8">3:8:5:8</span></span>8.
Thereupon they betake themselves, with the heart-spit, to the
purificatory bath <span id="fr_541"></span>[1](#fn_539.md). Now, the
anguish of the victim, in being slaughtered, concentrates itself into
the heart, and from the heart into the heart-spit; and whatever part of
cooked (food) is pierced that becomes palatable <span
id="fr_542"></span>[2](#fn_540.md): therefore let him roast it on the spit
after piercing it. Uppermost on the thrice-moved (portions of the)
victim he places that heart after pulling it off (the spit).

9\. He (the slaughterer) then hands the heart-spit (to the Adhvaryu).
Let him not throw it on the

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

ground, nor into the water; for were he to throw it on the ground, that
anguish would enter into the plants and trees; and were he to throw it
into the water, that anguish would enter into the water: hence neither
on the ground, nor into the water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:5:10">3:8:5:10</span></span>10. But
on going down to the water, let him bury it at the place where the dry
and the moist meet. But if he feel disinclined to going down (to the
water), he pours out a vessel of water in front of the sacrificial stake
and buries (the spit) at the place where the dry and the moist meet,
with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 22), 'Injure thou not the waters nor the plants!'
thus it injures neither the waters nor the plants; 'From every
fetter <span id="fr_543"></span>[1](#fn_541.md)--therefrom deliver us, O
king Varu*n*a! That they say, we swear by the "Inviolable (cows)," by
"Varu*n*a <span id="fr_544"></span>[2](#fn_542.md),"

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

therefrom deliver us, O Varu*n*a!' Thereby he delivers him <span
id="fr_545"></span>[1](#fn_543.md) from every noose of Varu*n*a, from all
(guilt) against Varu*n*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:5:11">3:8:5:11</span></span>11. He
then addresses (the water) <span id="fr_546"></span>[2](#fn_544.md) with,
'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us, unfriendly to him who
hateth us, and whom we hate!' For when they proceed with that (spit),
the waters, forsooth, as well as the plants, keep as it were receding
from him; but hereby he now makes a covenant with them, and so they
again approach to him, and that expiation is performed (to them). He
does not perform (the spit-bath) at the animal offering to Agni and
Soma, nor at that to Agni, but only at that of the Anûbandhyâ-cow <span
id="fr_547"></span>[3](#fn_545.md), for therewith the whole sacrifice
attains to completion. And in that they perform (the ceremony) with the
heart-spit at the cow (offering), thereby indeed it comes to be
performed also for the animal offering to Agni and Soma, as well as for
that to Agni.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_537"></span>[214:2](sbe2635.htm#fr_539.md) The Kâ*n*va text
(as the Taitt. S.) reverses the order of this and the following formula.
Nor does it begin a new Brâhma*n*a here.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[214:3](sbe2635.htm#fr_540.md) Having completed
the last after-offering, the Adhvaryu, in the <span id="page_215">p.
215</span> first place, throws the first chip of the sacrificial stake
into the fire, in accordance with [III, 7, 1, 32](sbe2627.htm#3:7:1:32.md).
For the four Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as, the deities of which are Soma,
Tvash*tri*, the wives of the gods, and Agni the householder, see part i,
p. 256, The first two offerings may consist only of ghee, or, as the
last two, of a piece of the tail.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[215:1](sbe2635.htm#fr_541.md) The technical term
for this purificatory ceremony is *s*ûlâvabh*ri*tha, or spit-bath.' On
the present occasion it is not performed (see [paragraph
11](sbe2635.htm#3:8:5:11).md), but it is inserted here because it forms the
conclusion of the ordinary animal offering, not connected with the
Soma-sacrifice (nirû*dh*a-pa*s*u), as well as of the offering of a
sterile cow (termed anûbandhyâ) to Mitra and Varu*n*a, which concludes
the Soma-sacrifice. See part i, p. 379, note 1, and [IV, 5, 2,
1](sbe2661.htm#4:5:2:1.md) seq.

<span id="fn_540"></span>[215:2](sbe2635.htm#fr_542.md) ? Ala*mg*usha,
'sufficient for eating,' Sâya*n*a, 'sufficient in itself,' St.
Petersburg Dict. The Kâ*n*va text has the probably preferable
reading,--atha ala*m*gusha*m* *s*ritam eva parit*ri*ndanti,--they then
pierce (with the spit) what is already sufficiently cooked.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[216:1](sbe2635.htm#fr_543.md) This is a doubtful
rendering in accordance with the suggestion in the St. Petersburg Dict.,
that 'dhâmno-dhâmna*h*' in this passage is an old corruption of
'dâmno-dâmna*h*.' The Taitt. S. has the sane reading. Sâya*n*a and
Mahîdhara take it in the sense of 'from every place (infested by
enemies, or, rendered fearful by thy noose) deliver us!' Could
'dhâmno-dhâmna*h*' be taken as gen. to 'râ*g*an?'

<span id="fn_542"></span>[216:2](sbe2635.htm#fr_544.md) ? Or, 'That they
say (i.e. mention the word) "Cows,"--that we swear by
"Varu*n*a,"--therefrom deliver us, O Varu*n*a!' If the mentioning of
words for cow (as well as the taking in vain of Varu*n*a's name) is
meant to he censured in this passage, *S*at. Br. II, 2, 4, 14 (part i,
p. 326 note) may be compared. It seems, however, doubtful whether the
author of the Brâhma*n*a took the term aghnyâ*h* as referring to 'cows'
here. The St. Petersburg Dict., s.v. *s*ap, translates, 'when we swear
by the name of Varu*n*a.' Instead of 'Yad âhur aghnyâ iti varu*n*eti
*s*apâmahe,' the Taitt. S (I, 3, 11, 1) reads 'Yad âpo aghniyâ
varu*n*eti *s*apâmahe,' which Sâya*n*a explains by 'O ye waters, O ye
Aghnyâ*h* (? inviolable ones, cows, waters), O Varu*n*a! thus we solicit
thee (to avert evil from us);' adding a passage to the effect that he
who approaches his better (addressing him) by name, wishes him
'pu*n*yârti;' while in the present mantra, he contends there is no mere
'taking the name of Varu*n*a in vain.'

<span id="fn_543"></span>[217:1](sbe2635.htm#fr_545.md) I.e. the sacrificer
(or the victim representing the sacrificer).

<span id="fn_544"></span>[217:2](sbe2635.htm#fr_546.md) According to the
Kâ*n*va text and Kâty. VI, 10, 5 they (the priests and sacrificer) touch
the water while muttering the formula--'From every fetter . . . . and
whom we hate.'

<span id="fn_545"></span>[217:3](sbe2635.htm#fr_547.md) See [IV, 5, 1,
5](sbe2660.htm#4:5:1:5.md) seq.
