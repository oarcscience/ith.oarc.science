### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:3:1">4:5:3:1</span></span>1. The
Shoda*s*in <span id="fr_932"></span>[2](#fn_928) (graha.md) forsooth is
Indra. Now, at one time the beings surpassed (ati-ri*k*)

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Indra--the beings
being the creatures--they were in a state of equality, as it were, with
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:3:2">4:5:3:2</span></span>2. Indra
then bethought himself, 'How can I stand forth over everything here, and
how may everything here be beneath me?' He saw that graha, and drew it
for himself. Then he stood forth over everything here, and everything
here was

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

beneath him. And, verily, for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw that
cup of Soma, he stands forth over everything here, and everything here
is beneath him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:3:3">4:5:3:3</span></span>3.
Wherefore it has been said by the *Ri*shi (Rig-veda III, 32, 11), 'The
sky hath not reached thy greatness, when thou didst rest on the earth
with thine other thigh,'--for, verily, yonder sky did not reach up to
his other thigh <span id="fr_933"></span>[1](#fn_929.md): so did he stand
forth over everything here, and everything here was beneath him. And,
verily, for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw that cup of Soma, he
stands forth over everything here, and everything here is beneath him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:3:4">4:5:3:4</span></span>4. He
draws it with a verse to the lord of the bay steeds (Indra Harivant);
they (the Udgât*ri*s) chant verses to (Indra) Harivant, and he (the
Hot*ri*) afterwards recites verses to (Indra) Harivant. For Indra seized
upon the strength, the fury (haras) of his enemies, the Asuras; and in
like manner does he (the sacrificer) now seize upon the strength, the
fury of his enemies: therefore he draws the graha with a verse to
(Indra) Harivant; they chant verses to Harivant, and he (the Hot*ri*)
afterwards recites verses to Harivant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:3:5">4:5:3:5</span></span>5. He
draws it with an Anush*t*ubh verse; for the morning press-feast belongs
to the Gâyatrî, the midday feast to the Trish*t*ubh, and the evening
feast to the *G*agatî. The Anush*t*ubh, then, is over and above <span
id="fr_934"></span>[2](#fn_930) (ati-rikta.md), and he thus makes that
(Soma of the

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sho*d*a*s*in) to
remain over: hence he takes it with an Anush*t*ubh.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:3:6">4:5:3:6</span></span>6. He
draws it in a square cup; for there are three worlds: these same worlds
he gains by three corners, and by the fourth corner he makes that (Soma)
to remain over;--therefore he draws it in a square cup.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:3:7">4:5:3:7</span></span>7. Let
him draw it at the morning pressing, after drawing the Âgraya*n*a.
Having been drawn at the morning pressing, it reposes apart from that
time: he thus makes it to outlast all (three) pressings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:3:8">4:5:3:8</span></span>8. Or he
may draw it at the midday pressing, after drawing the Âgraya*n*a,--but
this is mere speculation: let him rather draw it at the morning
pressing, after drawing the Âgraya*n*a: having been drawn at the morning
pressing, it reposes apart from that time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:3:9">4:5:3:9</span></span>9. He
thus draws it therefrom with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 33; Rig-veda I, 84, 3),
'Mount the chariot, O slayer of V*ri*tra, thy bay steeds have been
harnessed by prayer! May the stone by its sound draw hitherward thy
mind!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Sho*d*a*s*in (the
sixteenfold)!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Sho*d*a*s*in!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:3:10">4:5:3:10</span></span>10. Or
with this (verse, Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 34; Rig-veda I, 10, 3), 'Harness thy
long-maned, girth-filling bay steeds! Come hither to us, O Indra,
drinker of Soma, to hear our songs! Thou art taken with a support: thee
to Indra Sho*d*a*s*in!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Sho*d*a*s*in!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:3:11">4:5:3:11</span></span>11.
Thereupon he returns (to the sadas) and bespeaks the chant with, 'Soma
has been left over:

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Turn ye back <span
id="fr_935"></span>[1](#fn_931.md)!' for he indeed causes it to remain over
by that (Sho*d*a*s*in graha). He (the Adhvaryu) bespeaks it <span
id="fr_936"></span>[2](#fn_932.md) before the setting of the sun; and after
sunset he (the Hot*ri*) follows it up by reciting the *s*astra: thus he
thereby joins day and night together,--therefore he bespeaks (the
stotra) <span id="fr_937"></span>[3](#fn_933.md) before the

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

setting of the sun, and after sunset he follows it up by reciting the
*s*astra <span id="fr_938"></span>[1](#fn_934.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_928"></span>[397:2](sbe2662.htm#fr_932.md) The author has now
completed his exposition of the simplest form of Soma-sacrifice, viz.
the Agnish*t*oma, the libations of which are accompanied by twelve
chants (stotra) and as many recitations (*s*astra), and which (on the
press-day) requires one victim to Agni (see [IV, 2, 5,
14](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:14).md). He has also incidentally ([IV, 4, 2,
18](sbe2656.htm#4:4:2:18).md) touched upon the characteristic features of
the Ukthya sacrifice, viz. its second victim, a he-goat to Indra-Agni,
and three additional Uktha stotras and *s*astras ([p.
370](sbe2657.htm#page_370) note [1](sbe2656.htm#fn_856).md). He now
proceeds to <span id="page_398">p. 398</span> consider another libation
which, with its accompanying stotra and *s*astra, forms the distinctive
feature of the Sho*d*a*s*in sacrifice, i.e. the one having sixteen or a
sixteenth (hymn). This sacrifice also requires a third victim on the
press-day, viz. a ram to Indra. By the addition, on the other hand, of
the Sho*d*a*s*in graha, with its chant and recitation, to an ordinary
Agnish*t*oma, another form of one day's (ekâha) Soma-sacrifice is
obtained, viz. the Atyagnish*t*oma, or redundant Agnish*t*oma, with
thirteen stotras and *s*astras. This form of sacrifice is, however,
comparatively rarely used, and was probably devised on mere theoretic
grounds, to complete the sacrificial system. A somewhat more common form
is the Atirâtra, lit. 'that which has a night over and above,' differing
as it does from the Sho*d*a*s*in in that--besides a fourth victim (a
he-goat to Sarasvatî)--it has in addition a night performance of
libations, with three rounds (paryâyas) of four stotras and *s*astras
each (one for the Hot*ri* and for each of his three assistants), and
concluding at daybreak with one more stotra, the sandhi (twilight)
stotra, and the A*s*vina *s*astra and offering. These are the forms of
Soma-sacrifice referred to in the present book, as required for the
performance of sacrificial sessions (twelve days and more) of which its
concluding portion treats. With another form, the Vâ*g*apeya sacrifice,
the author deals in the next Kâ*nd*a. These--with the Aptoryâma, which
to the Atirâtra adds another course of four Atirikta, or superadded
stotras--constitute in the later official classification the seven
fundamental forms (sa*m*sthâ) of Soma-sacrifice. This term, meaning
properly 'termination, consummation,' probably applied originally to the
concluding rites of the Soma-sacrifice proper, as the distinctive
features of the several forms of sacrifice, but by a natural transition,
became the generic terms for the complete forms of sacrifice. See
Professor Weber's somewhat different explanation, Ind. Stud. IX, 229.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[399:1](sbe2662.htm#fr_933.md) ? Or either of his
thighs. The situation depicted in this verse would seem that of the
warrior Indra lying or kneeling on V*ri*tra, whom he has thrown on the
ground.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[399:2](sbe2662.htm#fr_934.md) Or, additional, in
excess; see [IV, 4, 3, 4](sbe2657.htm#4:4:3:4.md).

<span id="fn_931"></span>[401:1](sbe2662.htm#fr_935.md) See [IV, 2, 5,
8](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:8.md). The verb, here and elsewhere translated by 'to
bespeak,' is upâ-k*ri*, the proper meaning of which would seem 'to be to
prepare, to introduce, to bring up' the chant. As the same verb is,
however, also used for the 'driving up, or bringing up' of cattle (to
the stable), it may perhaps have a similar meaning in connection with
the stotra; the metres of the chant (which are often called the cattle
of the gods) being, as it were, 'led up' (or put to') by the Adhvaryu,
to be 'harnessed' or 'yoked' (yu*g*) by the Udgât*ri*; see [p.
311](sbe2649.htm#page_311), note [1](sbe2649.htm#fn_748.md). Instead of the
Prastara, handed to the Udgât*ri* on the occasion of the Pavamânas, two
stalks of sacrificial grass are generally used with other chants; but
certain stotras and sâmans require to be 'introduced' by special
objects, such as a fan, or the two churning sticks (for producing fire),
or water mixed with avakâ plants, or an arrow.

<span id="fn_932"></span>[401:2](sbe2662.htm#fr_936.md) ? Read 'tad' for
'tam;' or 'he calls upon him (the Udgât*ri*).'

<span id="fn_933"></span>[401:3](sbe2662.htm#fr_937.md) The
Sho*d*a*s*i-stotra usually consists of the Gaurivita Sâman (S. V. II,
302-4); but the Nânada Sâman (ib. II, 790-3) may be used instead. It is
performed in the ekavi*ms*a stoma, i.e. the three verses are chanted in
three turns, so as, by repetitions, to produce twenty-one verses; the
usual form being a a a-b b b-c; a-b b b-c c c; a a a-b-c c c. For some
modifications in the present case, see Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 258
note. The first turn is to be performed in a low voice, while the sun is
going down; the second in a middle voice, when the sun has disappeared,
but not entirely the daylight; and the third turn in a loud voice, when
darkness is closing in. If, for some reason or other, the stotra is
entirely performed after sunset, it is chanted with a loud voice
throughout. During the chanting a horse (black, if possible), or a
bullock, or he-goat is to stand at the front (or back) gate of the
sadas, facing the latter. Besides, a piece of gold is to circulate among
the chanters, each of them holding it, while his turn of chanting lasts,
and the Udgât*ri* (or all three) doing so during the nidhana or finale.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[402:1](sbe2662.htm#fr_938.md) The
Sho*d*a*s*i-*s*astra is minutely described in the Ait. Br. IV, 3 seq.
The opening verses are in the Anush*t*ubh metre (of sixteen syllables),
but otherwise also the Hot*ri* has by means of pauses and insertions of
formulas (nivid) to bring out its 'sixteenfold' character so as to
accord with its designation.
