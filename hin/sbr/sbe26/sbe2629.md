### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

##### B. THE KILLING OF THE VICTIM.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:3:1">3:7:3:1</span></span>1. There
are both an animal and a sacrificial stake, for never do they immolate
an animal without a stake. And as to why this is so:--well, animals did
not at first submit thereto that they should become food, as they are
now become food; for just as man here walks two-footed and erect, so did
they walk two-footed and erect.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:3:2">3:7:3:2</span></span>2. Then
the gods perceived that thunderbolt, to wit, the sacrificial stake; they
raised it, and from fear thereof they (the animals) shrunk together and
thus became four-footed, and thus became food, as they are now become
food, for they submitted thereto: wherefore they immolate the animal
only at a stake and never without a stake.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:3:3">3:7:3:3</span></span>3. Having
driven up the victim, and churned the fire, he binds it (to the stake).
And as to why this is so:--well, animals did not at first submit thereto
that they should become sacrificial food, as they are now become
sacrificial food and are offered up in the fire. The gods secured them:
even thus secured they did not resign themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:3:4">3:7:3:4</span></span>4. They
spake, 'Verily, these (animals) know not the manner of this, that it is
in fire that sacrificial food is offered, nor (do they know) that secure
resort (the fire): let us offer fire into the fire after securing the
animals and churning the fire, and they will know that this truly is the
manner of sacrificial food,

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

this its resort; that it is truly in fire that sacrificial food is
offered: and accordingly they will resign themselves, and will be
favourably disposed to the slaughtering.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:3:5">3:7:3:5</span></span>5.
Having, then, first secured the animals, and churned the fire, they
offered fire into the fire; and then they (the animals) knew that this
truly is the manner of sacrificial food, this its resort; that it is
truly in fire that sacrificial food is offered. And accordingly they
resigned themselves, and became favourably disposed to the slaughtering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:3:6">3:7:3:6</span></span>6. And in
like manner does he now offer fire into the fire, after securing the
animal and churning the fire. It (the animal) knows that this truly is
the manner of sacrificial food, this its resort; that it is truly in
fire that sacrificial food is offered; and accordingly it resigns itself
and becomes favourably disposed to the slaughtering. Therefore having
driven up the victim and churned the fire, he binds it (to the stake).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:3:7">3:7:3:7</span></span>7. As to
this they say, 'Let him not drive up (the victim), nor churn the fire;
but having taken the rope and straightway gone thither and put (the
rope) round it, let him bind it.' Let him, however, not do this; for it
would be as if he intended to commit secretly some lawless action. Let
him therefore go round there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:3:8">3:7:3:8</span></span>8. Then,
taking a straw, he drives it up, thinking, 'having a companion, I will
secure it;' for he who has a companion is strong.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:3:9">3:7:3:9</span></span>9. He
takes the straw with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 7), 'Thou art a cheerer!' for a
companion does cheer one: therefore he says, 'Thou art a cheerer.' 'The
celestial hosts have approached the gods;'

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

the celestial hosts, forsooth, are those beasts: 'they have submitted to
the gods' he means to say, when he says, 'The celestial hosts have
approached the gods.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:3:10">3:7:3:10</span></span>10.
'The considerate <span id="fr_456"></span>[1](#fn_454), best of
leaders;' for the gods are wise: therefore he says, 'The considerate,
best of leaders.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:3:11">3:7:3:11</span></span>11. 'O
divine Tvash*tri*, settle the wealth!' for Tvash*tri* is lord of beasts
(cattle), and wealth means cattle, it is with regard to those which did
not submit that the gods then said to Tvash*tri*, 'Quiet them,' when he
says, 'O divine Tvash*tri*, settle the wealth!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:3:12">3:7:3:12</span></span>12.
'May the offerings be relished by thee!' Since they themselves submitted
thereto that they should become sacrificial food, therefore he says,
'May the offerings be relished by thee!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:3:13">3:7:3:13</span></span>13.
'Rejoice, ye prosperous!' for cattle are prosperous: therefore he says,
'Rejoice ye prosperous.' 'O Lord of prayer, preserve our goods!' The
Lord of prayer, forsooth, is the Brahman; and goods mean cattle: those,
which did not submit, the gods on that occasion enclosed with the
Brahman on the farther side, and they did not pass over it. And in like
manner does he now enclose them with the Brahman on the farther side,
and they do not pass over it: therefore he says, 'O Lord of prayer,
preserve our goods!' Having made a noose he throws it over (the
victim) <span id="fr_457"></span>[2](#fn_455). Now then as to the
binding itself.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_454"></span>[180:1](sbe2629.htm#fr_456) U*s*i*g* rather
means 'willing, loving, devoted.'

<span id="fn_455"></span>[180:2](sbe2629.htm#fr_457) According to the
Taitt. authorities (Sâya*n*a on Taitt. S. I, 3, 8), the rope is wound
round the right fore-leg and then passed upwards <span id="page_181">p.
181</span> to the head. From Kâty. VI, 3, 27, on the other hand, it
would seem that the rope is passed either between the horns (and under
the neck?), or round the horns.
