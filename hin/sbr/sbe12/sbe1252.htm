<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:1">2:4:1:1</A></FONT></span>1. Now after the performance of the Agnihotra he (optionally&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_792"></A><A HREF="#fn_788"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>) .approaches the fires with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. III, 37), 'Earth! ether! sky!' In saying 'Earth! ether! sky!' he renders his speech auspicious by means of the truth, and with that (speech) thus rendered propitious he invokes a blessing:--'May I be well supplied with offspring!' whereby he prays for offspring; '--well supplied with men!' whereby he prays for men (heroes); '--well supplied with viands!' whereby he prays for prosperity.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:2">2:4:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. That long (form of) fire-worship is a prayer for blessing, and so is this (short) one a prayer for blessing: hence even with this much he obtains all, and he may therefore worship the fires with it. 'Therewith, indeed, we perform,' so spake &Acirc;suri.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:3">2:4:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. Now, when he is about to set out on a journey&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_793"></A><A HREF="#fn_789"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, he approaches first the G&acirc;rhapatya, and thereupon the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:4">2:4:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. The G&acirc;rhapatya he approaches with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. III, 37 b seq.), 'Thou, that art friendly to man, protect my offspring!' He (Agni G&acirc;rhapatya), truly, is the guardian of offspring; and therefore he now makes over to him his offspring for protection.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:5">2:4:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. He then approaches the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, with 'Thou, that art worthy of praise, protect my cattle!' He (Agni), truly, is the guardian of cattle, and therefore he now makes over to him his cattle for protection&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_794"></A><A HREF="#fn_790"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:6">2:4:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. Thereupon he walks or drives off; and having got as far as what he considers to be the boundary&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_795"></A><A HREF="#fn_791"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he breaks silence. And when he returns from his journey he maintains silence from the moment he sees what he considers to be the boundary. And even though there be a king inside (one's house), one must not go to him (or any other person before one has rendered homage to the fires).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:7">2:4:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. He first approaches the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya fire, and thereupon the G&acirc;rhapatya. The G&acirc;rhapatya doubtless is a house (g<I>ri</I>h&acirc;<I>h</I>), and a house is a safe resting-place: so that he thereby (finally&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_796"></A><A HREF="#fn_792"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>) establishes himself in a house, that is, in a safe resting-place.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:8">2:4:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. He approaches the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya fire, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. III, 38 seq.), 'We have approached (thee), the all-knowing, the most liberal dispenser of</p>

<p><A NAME="page_359"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 359</FONT></A></p>  
<p>goods: O Agni, sovereign lord, bestow on us lustre and strength!' Having then sat down he sweeps the blades of grass&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_797"></A><A HREF="#fn_793"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (into the fire).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:9">2:4:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. Thereupon he approaches the G&acirc;rhapatya, with the text, 'He, Agni G&acirc;rhapatya, is the lord of the house, the most liberal dispenser of goods to our offspring: O Agni, lord of the house, bestow on us lustre and strength!' Having then sat down, he sweeps off the blades of grass. In this way (householders) mostly approach the fires with muttered prayer.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:10">2:4:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. However, one may also approach the fires silently,--and that for this reason:--If in the place (where one lives), a Br&acirc;hman or noble--in short, a better man--resides, one dares not say to him, 'I am going on a journey, take care of this (property) of mine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_798"></A><A HREF="#fn_794"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!' Now in this (sacrificial ground) one's betters indeed reside, viz. the divine Agnis: who, then, would dare to say to them, 'I am going on a journey, take ye care of this (property) of mine!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:11">2:4:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. The gods assuredly see through the mind of man: that (Agni) G&acirc;rhapatya therefore knows that he (the householder) now approaches in order to give</p>

<p><A NAME="page_360"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 360</FONT></A></p>  
<p>himself up to him. Silently he approaches the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya fire: that (Agni) &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya knows that he now approaches in order to give himself up to him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:12">2:4:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. Thereupon he walks or drives off; and having got as far as what he considers the boundary line, he releases his speech. And when he returns from the journey, he maintains silence from the moment he sees what he considers to be the boundary. And even though there be a king inside (one's house), one must not go to him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:13">2:4:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. He first approaches the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, and thereupon the G&acirc;rhapatya. Silently he approaches the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya; and silently he sits down and sweeps away the grass-blades. Silently he approaches the G&acirc;rhapatya; and silently he sits down and sweeps away the grass-blades.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:4:1:14">2:4:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. Then as to the observances in regard to (the entering of) his house. Now when a householder comes home from a journey, his house trembles greatly for fear of him, thinking, 'What will he say here? what will he do here?' It is therefore for fear of him that speaks or does anything on this occasion that the house trembles and is liable to crush his family; but him who neither speaks nor does anything, his house receives with confidence, thinking, 'He has not spoken here, he has not done anything here!' And should he be ever so angry at anything on this occasion, let him rather do on the next day whatever he might wish to say or do. This then is the observance in regard to the house&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_799"></A><A HREF="#fn_795"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>
