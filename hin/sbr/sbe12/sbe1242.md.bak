### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:3:1">2:1:3:1</span></span>1. The
spring, the summer, and the rains, these seasons (represent) the gods;
and the autumn, the winter, and the dewy season represent the fathers.
That half-moon which increases represents the gods, and that which
decreases represents the fathers. The day represents the gods, and the
night represents the fathers. And, further, the forenoon represents the
gods, and the afternoon the fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:3:2">2:1:3:2</span></span>2. Those
seasons, then, are the gods and the fathers; and whosoever, knowing
this, invokes them as the gods and fathers, with his invocation of the
gods the gods comply, and with his invocation of the fathers the fathers
comply. Him the gods favour at his invocation of the gods, and him the
fathers favour at his invocation of the fathers, whosoever, knowing
this, invokes (the seasons) as the gods and fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:3:3">2:1:3:3</span></span>3. Now
when he (the sun) moves northwards, then he is among the gods, then he
guards the gods; and when he moves southwards, then he is among the
fathers, then he guards the fathers <span
id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_665.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:3:4">2:1:3:4</span></span>4. When
he (the sun) moves northwards, then one may set up his fires;--the gods
have the evil dispelled

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

from them (by the sun): he (the sacrificer) therefore dispels the evil
from himself;--the gods are immortal: he therefore, though there is for
him no prospect of immortality, attains the (full measure of) life,
whosoever sets up his fires during that time. Whosoever, on the other
hand, sets up his fires when (the sun) moves southwards, he does not
dispel the evil from him,--since the fathers have not the evil dispelled
from them (by the sun). The fathers are mortal: hence he dies before (he
has attained the full measure of) life, whosoever sets up his fires
during that time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:3:5">2:1:3:5</span></span>5. The
spring is the priesthood, the summer the nobility, and the rainy season
the common people (vi*s*): a Brâhman therefore should set up his fires
in spring, since the spring is the priesthood; and a Kshatriya should
set them up in summer, since the summer is the nobility; and a Vai*s*ya
should set them up in the rainy season, since the rainy season is the
common people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:3:6">2:1:3:6</span></span>6. And
whosoever <span id="fr_670"></span>[1](#fn_666.md) desires to become
endowed with holy lustre (brahmavar*k*asin), let him set up his fires in
spring,--for the spring is the priesthood,--and he will certainly become
endowed with holy lustre.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:3:7">2:1:3:7</span></span>7. And
whosoever desires to become a power (kshatra) <span
id="fr_671"></span>[2](#fn_667.md) in prosperity and renown, let him set up
his fires in summer,--for the summer is the nobility (kshatra),--and he
will certainly become a power in prosperity and renown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:3:8">2:1:3:8</span></span>8. And
whosoever may desire to be rich in progeny

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

and cattle, let him set up his fires in the rainy season <span
id="fr_672"></span>[1](#fn_668.md),--for the rainy season is the common
people, and the people means food,--and he certainly becomes rich in
progeny and cattle, whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fires in the
rainy season.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:3:9">2:1:3:9</span></span>9. \[In
the opinion of others\] both these (classes of) seasons have the evil
dispelled from them, for the sun is the dispeller of their evil, and as
soon as he rises he dispels the evil from both these (classes of
seasons). He should therefore set up his fires at any time, when he
feels called upon to sacrifice; and should not put it off from one day
to the morrow: for who knows the morrow of man <span
id="fr_673"></span>[2](#fn_669.md)?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_665"></span>[289:1](sbe1242.htm#fr_669.md) According to the
Kâ*n*va text, it is the rising sun, that guards the god-seasons and
father-seasons respectively.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[290:1](sbe1242.htm#fr_670.md) I.e. whatsoever
Brâhman, as the Kâ*n*va text reads.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[290:2](sbe1242.htm#fr_671.md) Kshatra*m* *s*riyâ
ya*s*asâ syâm iti. The Kâ*n*va text reads: Kshatrasya pratimâ syâ*m*
*s*riyâ ya*s*aseti, 'whosoever should wish to be an image of the kshatra
in wealth and glory.'

<span id="fn_668"></span>[291:1](sbe1242.htm#fr_672.md) The Black Ya*g*us
recommends *s*arad, autumn, for the Agnyâdheya in the case of a
Vai*s*ya.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[291:2](sbe1242.htm#fr_673.md) Ko hi manushyasya
*s*vo veda. The Kâ*n*va text has: Na vai manushya*h* *s*vastanam veda
(veda) ko hi (!) tasmai manushyo ya*h* *s*vastana*m* vidyât, 'in truth
no man knows the morrow, for what man, that knows the morrow, is there
for him?'
