### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE PUNARÂDHEYA OR RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SACRED FIRES <span id="fr_711"></span>[2](#fn_707).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:1">2:2:3:1</span></span>1. Now
Varu*n*a established this (fire), being desirous of sovereignty. He
obtained sovereignty; and, accordingly, whether one (who has established
the fires) knows (this) or not, they call him 'king Varu*n*a.' Soma
(established the fire), being desirous of glory. He became glorious,
and, accordingly, whether one obtains a hold on Soma, or whether

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

one does not, they both obtain (glory),--for it is glory that people
thereby get to see. Glorious therefore he becomes, and sovereignty he
obtains, whosoever, knowing this, establishes a sacrificial fire of his
own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:2">2:2:3:2</span></span>2. Now
once upon a time the gods deposited with Agni all forms (rûpa) <span
id="fr_712"></span>[1](#fn_708), both domestic and wild; either because
they were about to engage in battle, or from a desire of free scope, or
because they thought that he (Agni) would protect them as the best
protector.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:3">2:2:3:3</span></span>3. But
Agni coveted them, and seizing them he entered the seasons with them.
'Let us go back thither,' said the gods, and betook themselves to the
place where) Agni (was) concealed. They were disheartened and said,
'What is here to be done? what counsel is there?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:4">2:2:3:4</span></span>4. Then
Tvash*tri* beheld that re-consecrated fire (Punar-âdheya). He
established it and thereby gained an entrance to Agni's beloved abode.
He (Agni) gave up to him both kinds of forms, domestic and wild: hence
they call them Tvash*tri*'s forms; since it is from Tvash*tri* that all
form proceeds <span id="fr_713"></span>[2](#fn_709); but all other
creatures of whatever kind undergo it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:5">2:2:3:5</span></span>5. It is
for him (Tvash*tri*), then, that one must re-establish the fire: for
thus he enters Agni's

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

beloved abode, and the latter gives up to him both kinds of forms,
domestic and wild. In that (fire) those two kinds of forms are seen:
such is the ascendancy (which one obtains by the punarâdhyeya),--people,
indeed, envy him; thus he thrives, and a conspicuous position (is
obtained by him).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:6">2:2:3:6</span></span>6. To
Agni belongs this sacrifice. Agni is the light, the burner of evil: he
burns away the evil of this (sacrificer): and the latter becomes a light
of prosperity and glory in this, and a light of bliss <span
id="fr_714"></span>[1](#fn_710) in yonder, world. This, then, is the
reason why he should establish the fires (a second time).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:7">2:2:3:7</span></span>7. Let
him establish the fires (the second time) in the rainy season. The rains
are all the seasons, for the rains are indeed all the seasons: hence, in
counting over years, people say, 'In such and such a year (or rain,
varsha) we did it; in such and such a year (or rain) we did it.' The
rains, then, are one of the forms of manifestation (rûpa) of all
seasons <span id="fr_715"></span>[2](#fn_711); and when people say,
'To-day it is as if in summer,' then that is in the rainy season; and
when they say, 'To-day it is as if in spring,' then that, too, is in the
rainy season. From the year (or rain, varsha), indeed, (is named) the
rainy season (varshâ*h*).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:8">2:2:3:8</span></span>8. There
is, moreover, an occult form (through which the rains manifest
themselves in the seasons) <span id="fr_716"></span>[3](#fn_712). When
it blows from the east, then that is the characteristic sign of
spring:--when it thunders, it is that of

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

summer;--when it rains, it is that of the rainy season; when it
lightens, it is that of autumn <span
id="fr_717"></span>[1](#fn_713);--when it ceases to rain, it is that of
winter. The rains are all the seasons. The seasons he (Agni) entered:
from out of the seasons, therefore, he now produces him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:9">2:2:3:9</span></span>9. But
the sun also is all the seasons: when he rises, then it is spring;--when
the cows are driven together (for milking), then it is summer;--when it
is mid-day, then is the rainy season;--when it is afternoon, then it is
autumn;--when he sets, then it is winter. At mid-day (madhyandina),
therefore, he should establish his fires, for then that (sun) is nearest
to this world, and hence he produces that (fire) from the nearest centre
(madhya).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:10">2:2:3:10</span></span>10.
Verily, this man is affected with evil, as with a shadow. But then (at
mid-day) that (evil) of his (like his shadow) is smallest, and shrinks,
as it were, beneath his foot: hence he thereby crushes that evil, when
it is smallest. For this reason also he should establish his fires (the
second time) at mid-day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:11">2:2:3:11</span></span>11. He
takes it out (from the Gârhapatya) by means of sacrificial grass. By
means of fire-wood, indeed, he takes it out the first time; and (were he
to take it out) with fire-wood the first time, and with fire-wood the
second time, he would commit a repetition, and raise a conflict. Now
sacrificial grass means water, and the rainy season also means water. He
(Agni) entered the seasons: with water he accordingly produces him from
out of the waters; this is why he takes it (the fire) out by means of
sacrificial grass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:12">2:2:3:12</span></span>12.
Having prepared an (ordinary) rice cake on

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

two arka <span id="fr_718"></span>[1](#fn_714) leaves, he puts it in the
place where he is about to establish the Gârhapatya fire, and thereon
lays down the Gârhapatya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:13">2:2:3:13</span></span>13.
Having prepared a (second) barley cake on two arka leaves, he puts it in
the place where he is about to establish the Âhavanîya fire, and thereon
lays down the Âhavanîya. \[Some do so\] arguing, 'Thereby we cover them
with the first two fires;' but let him not do so, for it is by the
nights that they come to be covered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:14">2:2:3:14</span></span>14. He
then offers to Agni a sacrificial cake (puro*d*âsa) on five
potsherds <span id="fr_719"></span>[2](#fn_715). Its offering prayers
and invitatory prayers consist of paṅkti strophes of five pâdas
each <span id="fr_720"></span>[3](#fn_716); for there are five seasons,
and the seasons he (Agni) entered: from the seasons he accordingly
produces him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:15">2:2:3:15</span></span>15. The
whole (sacrifice) belongs to Agni; for it was thereby that Tvash*tri*
entered Agni's beloved abode, and therefore the whole (sacrifice)
belongs to Agni <span id="fr_721"></span>[4](#fn_717).

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:16">2:2:3:16</span></span>16.
They perform it (with the formulas pronounced) in a low voice; for if
one wishes to prepare anything specially for a relative or friend, one
must take care to keep it secret. Now the other sacrifice belongs to all
the deities, but this belongs specially to Agni; and what is (kept)
secret, that is (spoken of) in a low voice: this is why they perform it
in a low voice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:17">2:2:3:17</span></span>17. The
last after-offering he performs aloud; for then he has completed his
work, and every one becomes aware of what has been done.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:18">2:2:3:18</span></span>18.
Having uttered his call (and having been responded to by the
Âgnîdhra) <span id="fr_722"></span>[1](#fn_718), he says (to the
Hot*ri*), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Samidhs
(kindling-sticks)!'--the latter being one of Agni's mystic forms of
manifestation (rûpa); but he may also say, 'Pronounce the
offering-prayer to the fires!'--that being Agni's real (exoteric)
form <span id="fr_723"></span>[2](#fn_719).

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:19">2:2:3:19</span></span>19. He
(the Hot*ri*) recites <span id="fr_724"></span>[1](#fn_720), '. . . They
(the Samidhs), O Agni, may accept of the butter! Vau*gh*ak <span
id="fr_725"></span>[2](#fn_721)!' '. . . He (Tanûnapât) may accept the
fire of the butter! Vau*gh*ak!' '. . . . They (the I*d*s) may, through
Agni, accept of the butter! Vau*gh*ak!' '. . . It (the barhis), the
fire, may accept of the butter! Vau*gh*ak!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:20">2:2:3:20</span></span>20. He
then says <span id="fr_726"></span>[3](#fn_722), 'Svâhâ Agnim!' with
reference to Agni's butter-portion;--'Svâhâ Agnim Pavamânam!' if they
determine upon (offering to) Agni, the blowing <span
id="fr_727"></span>[4](#fn_723); or 'Svâhâ Agnim Indumantam!' if they
determine upon Agni, the drop-abounding <span
id="fr_728"></span>[5](#fn_724);--'Svâhâ Agnim!'--'Svâhâ, the
butter-drinking Agnis! May Agni graciously accept of the butter!'--this
is the offering-prayer he (the Hot*ri*) pronounces.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:21">2:2:3:21</span></span>21. He
(the Adhvaryu) then says, with regard to Agni's (first) butter-portion,
'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!' He (the Hot*ri*)
recites <span id="fr_729"></span>[6](#fn_725), 'Awake Agni with praise,
enkindling the immortal, that he may take our offerings to the gods!'
For, indeed, when Agni is removed (from the hearth) <span
id="fr_730"></span>[7](#fn_726), he, as it were, sleeps: he (the priest)
now awakens, rouses

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

him. For the offering-prayer he recites, 'May Agni graciously accept of
the butter!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:22">2:2:3:22</span></span>22.
And, if they determine upon (offering the second butter-portion to (Agni
Pavamâna, let him then say, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni
Pavamâna;' and he (the Hot*ri*) recites (Rig-veda IX, 16, 19), 'O Agni,
thou breathest forth life; produce thou food and sap for us! drive far
away misfortune!' For thus, indeed, it becomes of the nature of Agni.
Pavamâna (the one that becomes purified) means the Soma; but this
(Soma-element) they eliminate from the butter-portion of Soma <span
id="fr_731"></span>[1](#fn_727). For the offering-prayer he recites,
'May Agni Pavamâna graciously accept of the butter!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:23">2:2:3:23</span></span>23. If,
on the other hand, they determine upon (offering to) Agni Indumat, let
him say, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Indumat!' He (the
Hot*ri*) recites (Rig-veda VI, 16, 16), 'Come hither, I will gladly sing
to thee yet other songs, O Agni! mayest thou grow strong by these
draughts (indu, drop).' Thus, indeed, it becomes of the nature of Agni:
the draught doubtless means Soma, but this (Soma-element) they eliminate
from the butter-portion of Soma. For the offering-prayer he recites,
'May Agni, the drop-abounding, graciously accept of the butter!' And
thus he makes it all of the nature of Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:24">2:2:3:24</span></span>24. He
then says, as to the chief offering (havis), 'Pronounce the invitatory
prayer to Agni!' 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni!' 'Pronounce the
invitatory prayer to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t (the maker of good
offerings)!' 'Pronounce the offering-prayer

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t <span id="fr_732"></span>[1](#fn_728)!' Then
where (otherwise) he would say, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the
gods <span id="fr_733"></span>[2](#fn_729)!' he now says, 'Pronounce the
offering-prayer to the Agnis!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:25">2:2:3:25</span></span>25. He
recites <span id="fr_734"></span>[3](#fn_730), '\[The divine Barhis\]
may accept (the offering) for Agni's abundant obtainment of abundant
gift! Vau*gh*ak!'--'\[The divine Narâ*s*a*m*sa\] may accept (the
offering) for abundant obtainment, in Agni, of abundant gift!
Vau*gh*ak!'--'The divine Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t . . . .' this third
(after-offering) is already in itself of the nature of Agni; and thus he
makes the after-offerings relate to Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:26">2:2:3:26</span></span>26.
Those same case-forms (of agni) <span id="fr_735"></span>[4](#fn_731),
which he recites in the offering-prayers, are six; namely, four at the
fore-offerings, and two at the after-offerings. Now there are six
seasons; and the seasons he (Agni) entered: out of the seasons he
accordingly thereby produces him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:27">2:2:3:27</span></span>27.
There are either twelve or thirteen syllables (in these six
case-forms) <span id="fr_736"></span>[5](#fn_732). Now there are either
twelve or thirteen months in a year <span
id="fr_737"></span>[6](#fn_733); and the

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

year, the seasons, he (Agni) entered: out of the seasons he accordingly
thereby produces him. In order to avoid sameness, no two (of these
forms) are alike; but (the fault of) sameness he would undoubtedly
commit, were any two of them alike. The characteristic form of the
fore-offerings is (alternately), 'May they accept,' 'May it (or he)
accept <span id="fr_738"></span>[1](#fn_734);' and that of the
after-offerings is, 'For the abundant obtainment of abundant gift.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:3:28">2:2:3:28</span></span>28. The
priests' fee for this (sacrifice) consists of gold <span
id="fr_739"></span>[2](#fn_735), This sacrifice belongs to Agni, and
gold is Agni's seed <span id="fr_740"></span>[3](#fn_736): this is why
the priests' fee consists of gold. Or it may be an ox; for the latter is
of the nature of Agni as far as its shoulder is concerned, since its
shoulder (by carrying the yoke) is as if burnt by fire. Moreover, Agni
is oblation-bearer to the gods, and that (ox) bears (or draws, loads)
for men: this is why an ox may be given as the priests' fee.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_706"></span>[313:1](sbe1245.htm#fr_710) The Kâ*n*va text
has: He said, 'Speak ye not thus; be thou a restrainer of
speech!'--'Speak ye not,' so (he said); for, having established the two
fires, one should not speak untruthfully (m*ri*shâ), nor should he who
utters speech speak untruthfully. He should, therefore, strive to speak
nothing but the truth.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[313:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_711) If the householder
who has set up his fires, finds, after a year or more, that he does not
prosper in his undertakings, or if he has otherwise met with
misfortunes, and thus his âdheya has not proved successful, he should
set up his fires a second time. The old fires have to be put out, either
early in the day on which the performance is to take place, or from
three nights to a whole year previous to the ceremony. With the
exceptions noticed in the sequel, the performance is the same as that of
the âdhâna.

<span id="fn_708"></span>[314:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_712) Compare the
corresponding legend Taitt, S. I, 5, 1; according to which the gods
deposited their precious goods (vâma*m* vasu) with Agni; and Pûshan and
Tvash*tri*, on performing sacrifice to Agni exclusively (the
punarâdhyeya), became possessed of the cattle, whence the latter are
said to belong to Pûshan (paush*n*a) and to Tvash*tri* (tvâsh*t*ra).
Afterwards Manu and Dhât*ri* (here identified with the year) also
performed the ceremony. See also *S*at. Br. II, 3, 4, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_709"></span>[314:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_713) Or, since it is to
Tvash*tri* that all form belongs.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[315:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_714) *G*yotir amutra
pu*n*yalokatvâ, lit, 'a light by (way of) blissful state.' The Kâ*n*va
text has the same reading.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[315:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_715) This speculation is
based on the identity of the words for year (varsha; also 'rain') and
the rains, or rainy season (varshâ*h*).

<span id="fn_712"></span>[315:3](sbe1246.htm#fr_716) The characteristics
of the seasons here selected are supposed to have a special connection
with the rain and rainy season.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[316:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_717) During the autumn,
or sultry season succeeding the rains, there are frequent displays of
sheet-lightning along the horizon at night.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[317:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_718) Calotropis
Gigantea. These cakes (apûpa, not puro*d*â*s*a, have first to be cooked
either on the Avasathya, or on a secular fire. Before the cakes are then
put on the Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya fire-places, the latter have to be
consecrated in the usual way (cf. p. 2); and, after the putting on of
the cakes, the fire-places are sprinkled by the Adhvaryu, while the
sacrificer holds on to him from behind. Katy. IV, 11, 8, Schol.

<span id="fn_715"></span>[317:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_719) Viz. he performs an
ish*t*i with such a rice-cake for the havis, as a substitute for the
tanûhavir-ish*t*is, offered after the full-offering, at the âdhâna. See
II, 2, 1, 6, and note.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[317:3](sbe1246.htm#fr_720) The paṅkti consists
of five octosyllabic pâdas. The anuvâkyâ and yâ*g*yâ at the chief
offering are Rig-veda IV, 10, 2 and 4; those of the svish*t*ak*ri*t,
ib., verses 4 and 1.--Â*s*v. II, 8, 14.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[317:4](sbe1246.htm#fr_721) The offering
prayers of all libations and offerings at this ish*t*i must therefore
contain Agni's name. At each of the fore-offerings and after-offerings a
different case-form of agni is added after the respective objects of
those offerings,--thus, '. . . samidho agne <span id="page_318">p.
318</span> ’gna â*g*yasya vyantu,' 'tanûnapâd agnim agna . . .,' 'i*d*o
agninâgne . . .,' &c. See par. 19; also [p. 148](sbe1224.htm#page_148),
n. [2](sbe1224.htm#fn_360); I, 5, 4, 1 seq.; I, 8, 2, 1 seq. The two
butter-portions otherwise offered to Agni or Soma respectively (cf. I,
6, 1, 20 seq.) are in this case offered to Agni; the anuvâkyâs,
according to Â*s*v. II, 8, 7, being Rig-veda VIII, 44, I, and VI, 16, 16
respectively. See, however, paragraphs 21 seq.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[318:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_722) Viz. the Adhvaryu
calls, Õ *s*râvaya, 'cause (him or one) to hear!' and the Âgnîdhra
responds by Astu *s*rausha*t*, 'yea, may he (or one) hear!'

<span id="fn_719"></span>[318:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_723) Here, at the first
fore-offering, an option is apparently left between the former, regular
summons (see I, 5, 3, 8), and the latter, modified so as to make it
apply directly to Agni. Katy. IV, 11, 11 allows the same option for the
first prayâ*g*a and anuyâ*g*a. For the latter, however, see further on,
par. 24. The Kâ*n*va recension has as follows:--Now when the Adhvaryu,
on stepping over (to the south side) and uttering his call (for the
Âgnîdhra) to bid attention, says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the
Samidhs!' then that, indeed, is one of Agni's forms of manifestation
(âgneyam eva tad rûpam); but here let him say, as it were, <span
id="page_319">p. 319</span> in a mystic way, 'Pronounce the
offering-prayer to the Agnis!' (paroksham iva tv agnîn ya*g*eti haiva
tatra brûyât.)

<span id="fn_720"></span>[319:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_724) See [p.
317](#page_317), note [4](#fn_717).

<span id="fn_721"></span>[319:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_725) A modification of
the ordinary vausha*t*. The Kâ*n*va text has here and in par. 25, as
usual, vaushal.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[319:3](sbe1246.htm#fr_726) At the fifth
fore-offering; see I, 5, 3, 22 seq.

<span id="fn_723"></span>[319:4](sbe1246.htm#fr_727) See II, 2, 1, 6,
and note; also II, 2, 1, 22.

<span id="fn_724"></span>[319:5](sbe1246.htm#fr_728) This points forward
to the second butter-portion, which is offered to Agni Pavamâna or Agni
Indumat, instead of Soma; the first being offered to Agni simply. Kâty.
IV, 11, I2.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[319:6](sbe1246.htm#fr_729) Rig-veda V, 14, 1.
See, however, the formulas prescribed by Â*s*valâyana, [p.
317](#page_317), note [4](#fn_717).

<span id="fn_726"></span>[319:7](sbe1246.htm#fr_730) The fire laid down
at the âdheya is removed when the punarâdheya is to be performed.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[320:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_731) Viz. that second
butter-portion which by right belongs to Soma (see I, 6, 1, 20 seq.),
but is here offered to Agni.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[321:1](sbe1246.htm#fr_732) For the formulas of
the chief offering and Svish*t*ak*ri*t, see [p. 317](#page_317), note
[3](#fn_716).

<span id="fn_729"></span>[321:2](sbe1246.htm#fr_733) That is, at the
altar-offerings; see I, 8, 2, 14. Cf. also [p. 318](#page_318), note
[2](#fn_719).

<span id="fn_730"></span>[321:3](sbe1246.htm#fr_734) See I, 8, 2, 15.
Here a different case-form of the word agni (viz. agne*h* and agnau) is
inserted in the offering-formulas of the first two anuyâ*g*as,
immediately after the word indicating the object of the offering; the
formula of the third and last anuyâ*g*a already containing the
nominative agni*h* in the same place.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[321:5](sbe1246.htm#fr_736) The locative case
agnau, inserted in the offering-prayer of the second after-offering, is
optionally made trisyllabic by being written and pronounced agnâ-u.

15. In Taitt. S. I, 5, 12 (referred to Kâty. XI, 2, 37) 'white gold'
(ra*g*ata*m* hira*n*yam), i.e. silver, is expressly mentioned as
unsuitable for the dakshi*n*â. The reason adduced is that, when the gods
claimed back the goods deposited with Agni, he wept, and the tears he
shed became silver; and hence, if one were to give silver as a
dakshi*n*â, there would be weeping in his house before a year had
passed.
