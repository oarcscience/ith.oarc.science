### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### C. THE SÂKAMEDHA OFFERINGS <span id="fr_913"></span>[1](#fn_909.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:1">2:5:3:1</span></span>1.
Verily, by means of the Varu*n*apraghâsâ*h* Pra*g*âpati delivered the
creatures from Varu*n*a's noose; and those creatures of his were born
without disease and blemish. Now with these Sâkamedha
offerings,--therewith indeed the gods slew V*ri*tra, therewith they
gained that supreme authority which they now wield; and so does he now
therewith slay his wicked, spiteful enemy and gain the victory: this is
why he performs these offerings in the fourth month (after the
Varu*n*apraghâsâ*h*). He performs them on two successive days.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:2">2:5:3:2</span></span>2. On the
first day he offers a cake on eight potsherds to Agni Anîkavat <span
id="fr_914"></span>[2](#fn_910.md). For it was after

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

shaping Agni into a sharp point <span id="fr_915"></span>[1](#fn_911.md),
that the gods rushed forward, intent on slaying V*ri*tra; and that sharp
point, Agni, swerved not. And so does he (the Sacrificer) now rush
forward, after shaping Agni into a sharp point, intent on slaying his
wicked, spiteful enemy; and that sharp point, Agni, swerves not: this is
why he sacrifices to Agni Anîkavat.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:3">2:5:3:3</span></span>3.
Thereupon, at midday, he offers a potful of boiled grain (*k*aru) to the
Maruts, the Scorchers (Sântapanâ*h*), for at midday indeed the scorching
winds scorched V*ri*tra; and thus scorched he lay panting and gasping,
being rent all over. And so do the scorching winds scorch his (the
Sacrificer's) wicked, spiteful enemy: hence (he sacrifices) to the
Maruts, the Scorchers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:4">2:5:3:4</span></span>4.
Thereupon, (in the evening, he offers a potful of boiled grain) to the
Maruts, the Householders (G*ri*hamedhina*h*). That pap he cooks after
driving

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

away the calves (from the cows) with the (palâ*s*a-) branch, and having
(all the cows) milked into the pot containing the strainers. Now,
whenever (in preparing the pap) they use (whole) rice-grains, then that
is a *k*aru: this nourishment <span id="fr_916"></span>[1](#fn_912.md) the
gods took when they were about to slay V*ri*tra on the morrow; and so
does he (the Sacrificer) now take that nourishment, being about to slay
his wicked, spiteful enemy. The reason, then, why it is milk-pap, is
that milk is nourishment, and rice-grains are nourishment, and that he
thus puts into him (âtman) that twofold nourishment. For this reason it
is a rice-pap (prepared) with milk.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:5">2:5:3:5</span></span>5. The
practice, in regard to this (pap, is as follows). The same altar covered
(with sacrificial grass) which served for the (oblation to) the Maruts,
the Scorchers, is (now used) <span id="fr_917"></span>[2](#fn_913.md). Near
this covered altar they lay down the enclosing-sticks and pieces of
wood. Having had (the cows) milked in the same way (as before), he (the
Adhvaryu) cooks the pap; and having cooked it and basted it with butter,
he removes it from the fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:6">2:5:3:6</span></span>6. They
then rinse either two plates or two dishes, and put that (pap) thereon
in two equal

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

parts. Having then made a hollow in each (pap), he (the Adhvaryu) pours
clarified butter therein, and wipes both the dipping-spoon and the
offering-spoon. Thereupon he takes the two dishes of pap, and walks up
(to the altar); and again, he takes the dipping and offering spoons, and
walks up; and having touched <span id="fr_918"></span>[1](#fn_914.md) the
covered altar, and laid the enclosing-sticks round (the fire) <span
id="fr_919"></span>[2](#fn_915.md), he puts on as many pieces of firewood
as he thinks fit. He then deposits those two dishes of pap, and the
dipping and offering spoons, in their places (outside the altar). The
Hot*ri* sits down on the Hot*ri*'s seat. Taking the dipping and offering
spoons, he (the Adhvaryu) says,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:7">2:5:3:7</span></span>7.
'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!' with reference to Agni's
butter-portion. He then takes four 'cuttings' of butter from the hollow
of the southern pap, and steps over (to the south side of the fire).
Having stepped over, and called for the (Âgnîdhra's) '*S*rausha*t*,' he
says (to the Hot*ri*), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni!' and
pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:8">2:5:3:8</span></span>8. He
then says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Soma!' with reference to
Soma's butter-portion. He then takes four cuttings of butter from the
hollow of the northern pap, and steps over. Having stepped over and
called for the '*S*rausha*t*,' he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer
to Soma!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vasha*t* has been
uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:9">2:5:3:9</span></span>9. He
then says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

to the Maruts, the Householders!' He makes an 'under-layer' of butter
(in the offering-spoon) from the hollow of the southern pap, takes two
cuttings from the latter, pours some butter thereon, and steps across.
Having stepped across and called for the '*S*rausha*t*,' he says,
'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Maruts, the Householders!' and
pours out the oblation as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:10">2:5:3:10</span></span>10. He
then says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t <span id="fr_920"></span>[1](#fn_916.md)!' He makes an
under-layer of butter from the hollow of the northern pap, takes two
cuttings from the latter, pours some butter thereon, and steps across.
Having stepped across and called for the '*S*rausha*t*,' he says,
'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t!' and pours out
the oblation as soon as the Vashat has been uttered. Thereupon he cuts
off the I*d*â <span id="fr_921"></span>[2](#fn_917.md), but no
fore-portion <span id="fr_922"></span>[3](#fn_918.md). Having invoked (the
I*d*â), they cleanse themselves. This is one mode of performance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:11">2:5:3:11</span></span>11.
Then there is this other. The same altar covered (with sacrificial
grass) which has served for the Maruts, the Scorchers, is (used now).
Near this covered altar they lay down the enclosing-sticks and pieces of
firewood; and having had (the cows) milked in the same way (as before)
he cooks the rice-pap. The butter he puts on so as to be no mere
accessory <span id="fr_923"></span>[4](#fn_919) Having cooked (the pap.md)
and basted

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

it, and removed it (from the fire), he anoints it. He then removes the
butter in the pot (from the fire), and wipes the dipping and offering
spoons. Thereupon, taking the dish with the pap, he walks up (to the
altar); and again, taking the butter in the pot, he walks up; and again,
taking the dipping and offering spoons, he walks up (to the altar). He
then touches that covered altar, lays the enclosing-sticks round (the
Âhavanîya fire), and puts on as many pieces of wood as he thinks fit. He
then deposits successively <span id="fr_924"></span>[1](#fn_920.md) (in
their respective places) the dish with the pap, the pot with butter, and
the dipping and offering spoons. The Hot*ri* sits down in the Hot*ri*'s
seat. Taking the dipping and offering spoons, he (the Adhvaryu) says,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:12">2:5:3:12</span></span>12.
'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!' with a view to (offering)
Agni's butter-portion. He then takes four 'cuttings' of butter from the
pot and steps across (to the offering-place on the south side of the
fire). Having stepped across and called for the (Âgnîdhra's)
*S*rausha*t*, he says (to the Hot*ri*), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer
to Agni!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vasha*t* has been
uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:13">2:5:3:13</span></span>13. He
then says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Soma!' with a view to
Soma's butter-portion. He then takes four cuttings of butter from the
pot, and steps across. Having stepped

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

across, and called for the *S*rausha*t*, he says, 'Pronounce the
offering-formula to Soma!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the
Vashat has been uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:14">2:5:3:14</span></span>14.
Thereupon he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the Maruts, the
Householders!' He then makes an 'under-layer' of butter (in the *g*uhû),
takes two cuttings from that pap, pours some butter thereon, re-anoints
(replenishes with butter the parts of the sacrificial dish from which he
has made) <span id="fr_925"></span>[1](#fn_921.md) the two cuttings, and
steps across (to the offering-place). Having stepped across and called
for the *S*rausha*t*, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the
Maruts, the Householders!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the
Vashat has been uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:15">2:5:3:15</span></span>15.
Thereupon he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t!' He then makes an under-layer of butter, takes one
cutting from the pap, pours twice butter thereon, without, however,
re-anointing the (place of the) cutting; and steps across. Having
stepped across, and called for the *S*rausha*t*, he says, 'Pronounce the
offering-prayer to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t!' and pours out the oblation, as
soon as the Vashat has been uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:16">2:5:3:16</span></span>16, He
then cuts off the I*d*â, but no fore-portion. Having invoked (the
I*d*â), they (the priests) eat it. As many members of (the sacrificer's)
household as are entitled to partake of the remains of sacrificial

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

food <span id="fr_926"></span>[1](#fn_922) may eat (of the pap.md); or the
officiating priests may eat it; or, if there be abundant pap, other
Brâhmans also may eat of it. The pot having then been covered, before it
is quite emptied, they put it away in a safe place, for the 'full-spoon
ceremony.' Thereupon they let the calves together with their mothers;
and thus the cattle take that nourishment. That night he performs the
Agnihotra with rice-gruel. In the morning they milk a cow, which suckles
an adopted calf <span id="fr_927"></span>[2](#fn_923.md), for the purpose
of the offering to the fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:17">2:5:3:17</span></span>17.
Thereupon, in the morning, either after or before the performance of the
Agnihotra--whichever he pleases--he cuts out (the remaining rice-pap)
with the darvi-spoon <span id="fr_928"></span>[3](#fn_924.md) from the
un-emptied pot, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. III, 49), 'Full, O spoon, fly
away, well filled fly back to us!

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> O thou (Indra), of
a hundredfold powers, let us two barter food and drink, like wares!' In
like manner as an invitatory prayer (is used at offerings) so does he by
this (verse) invite him (Indra) to that share.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:18">2:5:3:18</span></span>18. Let
him then tell (the Sacrificer) to make a bull roar. 'If it roars,' say
some, 'then that (sound) is the Vashat; let him offer after that
Vashat.' And in this way indeed he calls Indra in his own form to the
slaying of V*ri*tra <span id="fr_929"></span>[1](#fn_925.md); for the bull
is indeed Indra's form: hence he thereby calls Indra in his own form to
the slaying of V*ri*tra. If it roars, then one may know that Indra has
come to his sacrifice, that his sacrifice is with Indra. And should it
not roar, let the priest, seated on the south side (viz. the Brahman),
say, 'Sacrifice!'--this, indeed, is Indra's voice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:19">2:5:3:19</span></span>19. He
offers with the text (Vâ*g*. S. III, 50), 'Give unto me, (and) I give
unto thee. Bestow (gifts) on me, (and) I bestow on thee <span
id="fr_930"></span>[2](#fn_926)! And mayest thou give me guerdon, (and.md)
I will give thee guerdon! Svâhâ!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:3:20">2:5:3:20</span></span>20. He
then offers a cake on seven potsherds to the sportive (Krîdina*h*)
Maruts. For when Indra went forward in order to slay V*ri*tra, the
sportive Maruts were sporting around him singing his praises; and even
so do they sport around this (Sacrificer), singing his praises, now that
he is about to slay his wicked, spiteful enemy: this

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

is why (he sacrifices) to the sportive Maruts <span
id="fr_931"></span>[1](#fn_927). Thereupon (follows the performance.md) of
the Great Oblation (Mahâ-havis): this (performance) is in accordance
with that of the great (seasonable) oblation <span
id="fr_932"></span>[2](#fn_928.md).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_909"></span>[408:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_913.md) The performance of
the Sâkamedha offerings requires two days. In the first place--after the
Âhavanîya has been 'taken out' from the Gârhapatya--both fires are taken
up by means of (or 'made to mount') the two kindling-sticks, and
transferred (by 'churning out') to another altar (the uttaravedi). On
the first day oblations are then made to Agni Anîkavat, the Maruta*h*
Sântapanâ*h* and the Maruto G*ri*hamedhina*h*, these being completed on
the next morning by a Darvihoma to Indra, and an oblation of cake to the
Maruta*h* Krî*d*ina*h*. Then follows the Mahâhavis, consisting--besides
the five constant oblations--of oblations to Indra-Agni, Mahendra, and
Vi*s*vakarman. In the afternoon takes place the Mahâpit*ri*ya*gñ*a, or
(Great) sacrifice to the Manes (performed on a special altar and
fire-place, south of the Dakshi*n*âgi); which is succeeded by the
Traiyambakahoma, or offering to Rudra Tryambaka, performed on a
cross-way somewhere north of the sacrificial ground.

<span id="fn_910"></span>[408:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_914.md) That is, Agni, the
'sharp-pointed' or 'sharp-edged;' an epithet apparently referring to the
pointed flames or tongues of. Agni. The St. Petersburg Dict. takes it to
mean 'Agni, possessed of a face.' Perhaps it may mean, 'Agni,
constituting the front or van of the army.' In *S*at. Br. III, 4, 4, 14,
Agni is likened to the point (anîka) of the thunderbolt, Soma to its
shaft (*s*akya), and Vish*n*u <span id="page_409">p. 409</span> to the
part where the point is fixed on the shaft (kulmala). Compare the
corresponding passage in Taitt. Br. I, 6, 6: 'The gods and Asuras were
contending. Agni spake, "My body is anîkavat (possessed of an army, acc.
to Sâya*n*a): satisfy it and you will overcome the Asuras!" The gods
prepared a cake on eight potsherds for Agni Anîkavat. Agni Anîkavat,
being pleased with his share, produced for himself four anîkas; and
thereby the gods prevailed and the Asuras were defeated. . . . Now Agni
Anîkavat is yonder sun: his rays are the anîkas.' Here anîka would
rather seem to mean either 'dart or 'face.' \[In Taitt. Br. I, 6, 2, 5,
in the battle between the gods and Asuras, Agni is represented as the
mukham of the gods, which Sâya*n*a takes to mean the 'van-guard' or 'the
champion' of the gods. Compare also *S*at. Br. II, 6, 4, 2; XI, 5, 2,
4\]. Acc. to the Black Ya*g*us, the cake to Agni Anîkavat is to be
prepared (or offered) simultaneously (sâkam) with the rising of the sun;
whence is probably derived the term 'Sâkam-edha.'

<span id="fn_911"></span>[409:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_915.md) I.e. into a
sharp-pointed weapon; or, perhaps, 'after appointing Agni their leader.'
Cf. [p. 449](sbe1262.htm#page_449.md) note; and *S*at. Br. V, 3, 1, I.

<span id="fn_912"></span>[410:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_916.md) That is,
strengthening food. Instead of medhas, the Kâ*n*va recension has
throughout medham (as once in our text).

<span id="fn_913"></span>[410:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_917.md) At the preceding
offering, that to the Maruta*h* Sântapanâ*h*, the ish*t*i is either to
be interrupted at the end of the Samish*t*aya*g*us (see I, 9, 2, 25-28),
or only the offering of the Barhis (I, 9, 2, 29-31) is to be omitted.
The concluding ceremonies are to be performed either on the same day,
after the offering to the Maruto G*ri*hamedhina*h*--which itself
concludes with the I*d*â, and (acc. to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 6, 6) has
neither fore-offerings nor after-offerings--or the following morning
after the Darvihoma (see par. 17). Katy. V, 6, 3-5, 2-33.

<span id="fn_914"></span>[411:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_918.md) According to Katy.
V, 6, 14, he is to do so either silently, or with the text (Vâ*g*. S.
II, 2) used in spreading the sacrificial grass on the altar. See I, 3,
3, 11.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[411:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_919.md) See I, 3, 3, 13; 3,
4, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_916"></span>[412:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_920.md) See I, 7, 3, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_917"></span>[412:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_921.md) See I, 8, 1, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_918"></span>[412:3](sbe1258.htm#fr_922.md) See I, 7, 4, 6 seq.

<span id="fn_919"></span>[412:4](sbe1258.htm#fr_923.md) Ned eva
prative*s*am â*g*yam adhi*s*rayati. There seems to be some mistake here.
The commentary on Katy. V, 6, 6 has 'tad eva' instead of 'ned eva.'
Sâya*n*a says that the butter is put on the Dakshi*n*âgni; but according
to Kâty. V, 6, 24, it is put on the fire together with the pap. The
Kâ*n*va text has, abhyardha â*g*ya*m* <span id="page_413">p. 413</span>
sthâlyâm adhi*s*rayati, 'he puts on the butter in the pot on the near
side.'

<span id="fn_920"></span>[413:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_924.md) In the original
this is expressed by repetition of the verb, as was the case in the last
sentence but one, where the original construction is retained. The
Kâ*n*va text has merely, 'Having taken (the pap) with the dish, he
hastes up (udâdravati).'

<span id="fn_921"></span>[414:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_925.md) 'Pratyanakti' is
probably the same as 'pratyabhighârayati,' generally applied to the
basting of the avadâna-sthâna, or that part of the havis from whence the
cuttings have been made (Kâty. I, 9, II; the 'replenishing' of the havis
in *S*at. Br. I, 7, 3, 6 refers to the same thing). See, however, Kâty.
V, 6, 22, where it is ruled that no pratyabhighâra*n*a is to take place
at the present sacrifice. The Kâ*n*va MS., on the other hand, reads, 'he
does not re-anoint the two cuttings.' Perhaps he is to anoint separately
the two cut-off pieces.

<span id="fn_922"></span>[415:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_926.md) That is, those who
have been invested with the sacrificial cord. According to Taitt. Br. I,
6, 7, 1 the mistress of the house is not to eat of it, but an additional
(prative*s*a) pap is to be cooked specially for her on the Dakshi*n*a
fire.

<span id="fn_923"></span>[415:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_927.md) 'In the morning
they tie up the (adopted) calf of a nivânyâ (cow suckling a strange
calf),' Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_924"></span>[415:3](sbe1258.htm#fr_928.md) The Darvi-homa, or
oblation of a darvi-spoonful of boiled rice to Indra, the associate of
the Maruts, may be considered as part of the G*ri*hamedhîyâ ish*t*i,
being, as it were, an offering of remains (or scrapings, nishkâsa,
Taitt. Br. I, 6, 7, 3); cf. Kâty. V, 6, 33. Like all *G*uhoti-offerings,
the darvi-homa is performed by the Adhvaryu while seated on the north
side of the fire. According to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 7, 3, it is to be
offered in the Gârhapatya, but according to Katy. V, 6, 38 (comm.) in
the Âhavanîya. If the concluding ceremonies of the Sântapanîyâ ish*t*i
(from the offering of the Barhis) have not already been performed on the
previous night, they have to be performed after the conclusion of the
darvi-homa. If, however, only the offering of the Barhis was then
omitted, the darvi-homa, if performed before the Agnihotra, is followed
immediately by that oblation.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[416:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_929.md) On the symbolic
connection of the seasonal offerings, especially the Sâkamedhâ*h*, with
the slaying of V*ri*tra, the evil spirit of drought, see II, 6, 4, 1.

<span id="fn_926"></span>[416:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_930.md) According to
Mahîdhara, this first line is spoken by Indra to his worshipper; the
second line containing the latter's reply.

<span id="fn_927"></span>[417:1](sbe1258.htm#fr_931.md) Comp. Taitt. Br. I,
6, 7, 4: When Indra had slain V*ri*tra (with the thunderbolt) he went to
the farthest distances, thinking that he had missed (his aim). He said,
'Who will know this' \[viz. whether V*ri*tra is really dead or not,
comm.\]? The Maruts said, 'We will choose a boon, then we will know
(find it out): let the first oblation be prepared for us!' They sported
(danced about) on him (V*ri*tra, and thereby found out that he was
dead).

<span id="fn_928"></span>[417:2](sbe1258.htm#fr_932.md) That is to say, the
Mahâ-havis, or Great Oblation, though apparently only an integral part
of the Sâkamedhâ*h*, is in reality its chief ceremony, and may therefore
be considered as being itself on a par with the other seasonal
offerings; hence it requires the five oblations common to all the
*K*âturmâsyas; see II, 5, 1, 8-11. The Black Ya*g*us it seems does not
use the term Mahâ-havis, but assigns more importance to the
Mahâ-pit*ri*ya*gñ*a (see II, 6, 1, 1 seq.). See Âpastamba's Paribhâshâs,
80, 81 (M. Müller, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morg. Ges. IX), according
to which the sacrifice to the Manes belongs to the Mahâya*gñ*as.
