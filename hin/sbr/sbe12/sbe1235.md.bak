### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE AFTER-OFFERINGS (ANUYÂ*G*AS).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:1">1:8:2:1</span></span>1. They
now remove two burning samidhs (from the Âhavanîya fire). That fire,
indeed, is now worn out, (and therefore useless) for the
after-offerings, since it has been carrying the sacrifice to the gods:
'Let us perform the after-offerings in such (fire) as is not out-worn!'
thus they think, and for this reason they remove those two burning
samidhs (from the fire).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:2">1:8:2:2</span></span>2.
Thereupon they again move them close (to the fire). Thereby they cause
the fire to increase again and to be no longer out-worn: 'Let us perform
what part of the sacrifice remains still unaccomplished in such (fire)
as is not out-worn!' so think they, and for this reason they again move
them close (to the fire).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:3">1:8:2:3</span></span>3. He
(the Âgnîdhra) then puts on the kindling-stick

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (which was
reserved at the time of kindling) <span id="fr_544"></span>[1](#fn_540.md).
He thereby kindles that (fire): 'Let us perform in the well-kindled
(fire) what part of the sacrifice remains unaccomplished!' thus he
thinks, and for this reason he puts on the samidh.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:4">1:8:2:4</span></span>4. The
Hot*ri* consecrates it (the kindling-stick), with the formula (Vâ*g*. S.
II, 14 a), 'This, O Agni, is thy kindler; mayest thou grow and increase
by it; and may we also grow and increase!' for even as before he recited
over the fire when it was being kindled, so also now he recites. This is
the Hot*ri*'s duty; but the sacrificer himself may pronounce the
consecratory formula, if he think that the Hot*ri* does not know
it <span id="fr_545"></span>[2](#fn_541.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:5">1:8:2:5</span></span>5. He
(the Âgnîdhra) then sweeps (the fire) together. He thereby harnesses it:
'Thus harnessed, may it convey (to the gods) what part of the sacrifice
still remains unaccomplished!' thus he thinks, and for this reason he
sweeps it together. He sweeps

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

once (with the band of the fire-wood along each of the three
enclosing-sticks); for thrice each time they swept for the gods on the
former occasion <span id="fr_546"></span>[1](#fn_542.md): 'Lest we should
do it in the same way as for the gods;' thus he thinks, and accordingly
he sweeps once each time in order to avoid repetition (of sacrificial
performance). Repetition the would undoubtedly commit, if he were to
sweep thrice the first time and thrice the second: for this reason he
sweeps once (along each stick).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:6">1:8:2:6</span></span>6. He
sweeps (each time), with the formula (Vâ*g*. S. II, 14 b), 'O Agni,
food-gainer, I cleanse thee, the food-gainer, who hast hastened to the
food!' On the former occasion he said, 'thee who art about to hasten (to
the food),' for on that occasion he was indeed about to hasten thither;
now, however, he says, 'who hast hastened (to the food),' for now he has
indeed hastened thither: for this reason he says 'thee who hast
hastened.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:7">1:8:2:7</span></span>7. He now
makes the after-offerings. Whatever gods he invokes by means of this
sacrifice, and for whichever of them this sacrifice is performed, to all
offering has now been made; and to all those to whom offering has been
made, he now, after that, offers once more: hence the name
'after-offerings.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:8">1:8:2:8</span></span>8. Now
this is why he makes the after-offerings. The after-offerings assuredly
are the metres <span id="fr_547"></span>[2](#fn_543.md), and the metres are
the cattle of the gods: hence as cattle, when harnessed, here convey
(burdens) for men, so in like manner the metres, being harnessed,

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

convey the sacrifice to the gods. Now the occasion on which the metres
gratified the gods, and for which the gods, in their turn, then
gratified the metres, was when before this the metres, on being
harnessed, conveyed the sacrifice to the gods and thereby gratified
them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:9">1:8:2:9</span></span>9. And
this again is why he makes the after-offerings. The after-offerings are
the metres: hence he thereby gratifies the metres, and for this reason
also he makes the after-offerings. By whatever team, therefore, he has
himself drawn, that (team) he would thereby unyoke, saying, 'Give it to
drink, feed it well!' and thus his team is propitiated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:10">1:8:2:10</span></span>10. In
the first place he makes offering to the Barhis (sacrificial-grass
covering). Though the smallest metre, the gâyatrî is yoked first of the
metres <span id="fr_548"></span>[1](#fn_544.md); and this on account of its
strength, since, having become a falcon, it carried off the Soma from
heaven <span id="fr_549"></span>[2](#fn_545.md). They consider it unseemly,
however, that the gâyatrî, being the smallest metre, should be yoked
first of the metres; and the gods accordingly arranged the metres here,
at the after-offerings, so as it ought to be, 'lest there should be a
confusion.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:11">1:8:2:11</span></span>11. In
the first place, then, he offers to the Barhis. The Barhis indeed is
this world; the Barhis is the plants: hence he thereby bestows plants on
this world, and these plants are firmly rooted in this world. Now this
entire universe (*g*agat) is contained in this (metre), and therefore
the latter is (called) *g*agatî: this is why they have placed the
*g*agatî metre first.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:12">1:8:2:12</span></span>12. In
the second place he offers to Narâ*s*a*m*sa.

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Now, Narâ*s*a*m*sa
is the air. Man (nara), namely, means (human) being; and these same
beings move about in the air speaking aloud. And when he (man) speaks,
they say 'he chants (sa*m*s);' and therefore Narâ*s*a*m*sa is the
air <span id="fr_550"></span>[1](#fn_546.md). But the trish*t*ubh also is
the air <span id="fr_551"></span>[2](#fn_547.md), and for this reason they
have placed the trish*t*ubh second.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:13">1:8:2:13</span></span>13.
Then Agni is the last (to whom offering is made). Agni assuredly is the
gâyatrî; and therefore they placed the gâyatrî last. In this way they
established the metres in complete and proper order; and hence no
confusion here takes place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:14">1:8:2:14</span></span>14. The
Adhvaryu <span id="fr_552"></span>[3](#fn_548) says (to the Hot*ri*.md),
'Pronounce the offering-prayer (yâ*g*yâ) to the gods!' and the Hot*ri*
(begins his prayer) at all (the three offerings) with 'The divine . . .
.' For the metres assuredly are the gods of the gods, since they are
their cattle, and cattle means a home, and a home is a safe
resting-place. The after-offerings, doubtless, are the metres: therefore
the Adhvaryu says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the gods!' and at
all of them the Hot*ri* begins with 'The divine . . . <span
id="fr_553"></span>[4](#fn_549.md).'

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:15">1:8:2:15</span></span>15.
\['The divine Barhis (or Narâ*s*a*m*sa) may accept (the offering)\] for
abundant obtainment of abundant gift! \[Vausha*t*!\]' For a deity only
the vasha*t*-call is pronounced, to a deity only offering is made; but
here at the after-offerings there is no (proper) deity <span
id="fr_554"></span>[1](#fn_550.md). When he says 'The divine Barhis,' in
this there is neither Agni, nor Indra, nor Soma; when he says 'The
divine Narâ*s*a*m*sa,' neither is there in this anything whatever (of
the nature of a god); and what Agni there is (in the third
offering-prayer), he indeed is virtually the gâyatrî.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:16">1:8:2:16</span></span>16. The
reason, then, why he offers with the formula 'for abundant obtainment of
abundant gift <span id="fr_555"></span>[2](#fn_551.md),'

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

is that Agni is the obtainer of wealth, and Indra is the recipient of
wealth; and Indra and Agni are indeed the (joint) divinity of the
metres: and in this way it is for a deity that the vasha*t* is
pronounced, and to a deity that the offering is made.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:2:17">1:8:2:17</span></span>17.
After he has made the last after-offering, he pours together (the butter
which remains in the upabh*ri*t with that which attaches to the *g*uhû),
and offers it (by pouring it from the *g*uhû in a line from west to east
into the fire). For doubtless these are the after-offerings to the
fore-offerings: hence even as there, at the fore-offerings <span
id="fr_556"></span>[1](#fn_552.md), he makes the spiteful enemy pay tribute
to the sacrificer, and the one to be consumed pay tribute to the
consumer; so now he makes him pay tribute at the after-offerings.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_540"></span>[231:1](sbe1235.htm#fr_544.md) See I, 4, 1, 38.
The Adhvaryu takes the fresh stick (samidh), asks the permission of the
Brahman to step forward for the after-offerings; and orders the Âgnîdhra
to put the stick on, and trim, the fire. Whilst the Brahman mutters his
formula (Vâ*g*. S. II, 12-13), 'This thy sacrifice, O divine Savit*ri*,
they proclaimed to B*ri*haspati, the Brahman,' &c. (see I, 7, 4, 21),
the Âgnîdhra executes the Adhvaryu's orders. Kâty. III, 5, I; II, 2, 21.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[231:2](sbe1235.htm#fr_545.md) That is to say (as
would appear), if the Hot*ri* follows a school which does not recognise
this particular ceremony as belonging to the Hot*ri*'s ritual. Thus the
Â*s*val. *S*r. makes no mention of it, and hence a Hot*ri* belonging to
the *S*âkala or Bâshkala *s*âkhâs would not undertake the recitation of
this consecratory formula. The Sâṅkhây. *S*r., on the other hand, does
prescribe it (cf. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Volim. p. 135, note 4), and a
Hot*ri* of the Kaushîtaki-*s*âkhâ would accordingly claim it as his
privilege or duty to consecrate the samidh. For a somewhat different
view, cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 155; V, 408.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[232:1](sbe1235.htm#fr_546.md) See I, 4, 4, 14.
While, on the former occasion, the Âgnîdhra in sweeping moved round the
fire, on the present occasion he remains standing on the north side of
it. Katy. III, 5, 4.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[232:2](sbe1235.htm#fr_547.md) See I, 3, 2, 8, 9.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[233:1](sbe1235.htm#fr_548.md) See, for instance,
I, 3, 4, 6.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[233:2](sbe1235.htm#fr_549.md) For this myth, see
I, 7, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[234:1](sbe1235.htm#fr_550.md) That is, because
man (nara) speaks, chants, (*s*amsati) in it.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[234:2](sbe1235.htm#fr_551.md) Either because both
are in the middle (viz. the trish*t*ubh of the three chief metres, and
the air between heaven and earth), or because they consist of eleven
parts (viz. the trish*t*ubh of eleven syllables, and the air having ten
directions, *S*at. Br. VI, 2, 2, 34; VIII, 4; 2, 13, with itself as the
eleventh), or because they are both connected with Rudra. Comm.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[234:3](sbe1235.htm#fr_552.md) As on previous
occasions, the Adhvaryu first calls on the Âgnîdhra, 'Bid (Agni) hear (o
*s*râvaya)!' and the latter responds by 'Yea, may (he) hear (astu
*s*rausha*t*)!' This is repeated before each of the two other
after-offerings. See I, 5, 2, 16.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[234:4](sbe1235.htm#fr_553.md) The drift of the
argument of this paragraph is not quite clear to me. The after-offerings
have for their deities the metres, and hence the latter are apparently
called the deities of the deities, that is, of the <span
id="page_235">p. 235</span> recipients of the offerings. The difference
between the fore-offerings and after-offerings in regard to the
offering-formula lies in this, that at the first fore-offering the
Adhvaryu, in calling on the Hot*ri*, names the particular object of the
offering, viz. 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the samidhs!' while for
the remaining prayâ*g*as he merely calls 'Pronounce the
offering-prayer!' and the Hot*ri* begins all his prayers (after the
introductory âgur-formula) with the name of the respective recipient of
the oblation. At the after-offering, on the other hand, the Adhvaryu
calls each time, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the gods' (or,
according to Kâty. III, 5, 8, optionally without 'to the gods,' the
second and third times), and the Hot*ri*'s prayers begin with 'The
divine (Barhis, or Narâ*s*a*m*sa, or Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t) . . .: See I,
5, 3, 8 seq.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[235:1](sbe1235.htm#fr_554.md) Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t, the recipient of the third after-offering, is, as we
saw, regarded as representing the gâyatrî metre.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[235:2](sbe1235.htm#fr_555.md) Vasuvane
vasudheyasya.(vetu); perhaps better, as Sâya*n*a, on Taitt. S. II, 6, 9,
takes it, 'May he partake of the gift of wealth for the (sacrificer's)
obtainment of wealth.' 'For the wealth-desirer of wealth-gift' = 'for
the desirer of wealth-possession,' St. Petersb. Dict. Our author
apparently takes it in the sense of 'for the obtainer of wealth and for
the receiver of wealth;' and Mahîdhara (Vâ*g*. S. XXII, 48; XXVIII, 12)
interprets it 'for the giving (or obtainment) of wealth and for the
depositing of treasure (i.e. for burying a treasure in the sacrificer's
house!)' Harisvâmin takes vasuvaue as vocative; but the accent is
against his view.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[236:1](sbe1235.htm#fr_556.md) See I, 5, 3, 18.
