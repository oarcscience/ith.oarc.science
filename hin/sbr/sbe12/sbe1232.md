### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### OBLATION TO AGNI SVISH*T*AK*RI*T, \[AND THE BRAHMAN'S PORTIONS.\]

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:1">1:7:3:1</span></span>1. Now by
means of the sacrifice the gods ascended to heaven. But the god who
rules over

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

the cattle was left behind here: hence they call him Vâstavya, for he
was then left behind on the (sacrificial) site <span
id="fr_459"></span>[1](#fn_456) (vâstu.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:2">1:7:3:2</span></span>2. The
gods went on worshipping and toiling with the same (sacrifice) by which
they had ascended to heaven. Now the god who rules over the cattle, and
who was left behind here,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:3">1:7:3:3</span></span>3. He saw
(what occurred, and said), 'I have been left behind: they are excluding
me from the sacrifice!' He went up after them, and with his raised
(weapon) <span id="fr_460"></span>[2](#fn_457.md) rose up on the north--the
time (when this happened) was that of the (performance of the)
Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:4">1:7:3:4</span></span>4. The
gods said, 'Do not hurl!' He said, 'Do not ye exclude me from the
sacrifice! Set apart an oblation for me!' They replied, 'So be it!' He
withdrew (his weapon), and did not hurl it; nor did he injure any one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:5">1:7:3:5</span></span>5. The
gods said (to one another), 'Whatever portions of sacrificial food have
been taken out by us, they have all been offered up. Try to discover

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

some means by which we may set apart an oblation for him!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:6">1:7:3:6</span></span>6. They
said to the Adhvaryu priest, 'Sprinkle the sacrificial dishes (with
butter) in proper succession; and replenish them for the sake of one
(additional) portion, and again render them fit for use; and then cut
off one portion for each!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:7">1:7:3:7</span></span>7. The
Adhvaryu accordingly sprinkled the sacrificial dishes in proper
succession, and replenished them for the sake of one (additional)
portion, and again rendered them fit for use, and cut off one portion
for each. This then is the reason why he (Rudra) is called
Vâstavya <span id="fr_461"></span>[1](#fn_458), for a remainder (vâstu.md)
is that part of the sacrifice which (is left) after the oblations have
been made: hence, if sacrificial food is offered to any deity, the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t (Agni, 'the maker of good offering') is afterwards
invariably offered a share of it; because the gods invariably gave him a
share after themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:8">1:7:3:8</span></span>8. That
(offering) then is certainly made to 'Agni,' for, indeed, Agni is that
god;--his are these names: *S*arva, as the eastern people call him;
Bhava, as the Bâhîkas (call him); Pa*s*ûnâm pati ('lord of beasts,'
Pa*s*upati), Rudra, Agni <span id="fr_462"></span>[2](#fn_459.md). The name
Agni, doubtless, is the most auspicious

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (*s*ânta), and the
other names of his are inauspicious: hence it is offered to (him under
the name of) 'Agni,' and to (him as) the Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:9">1:7:3:9</span></span>9. They
(the gods) said, 'What we have offered unto thee who art in yonder
place <span id="fr_463"></span>[1](#fn_460.md), do thou render that
well-offered (svish*t*a) for us!' He made it well-offered for them; and
this is the reason why (it is offered) to (Agni as) the Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:10">1:7:3:10</span></span>10.
Having recited the invitatory formula <span
id="fr_464"></span>[2](#fn_461), he (the Hot*ri*.md) enumerates (those
deities) which (have received oblations at the fore-offerings,
butter-portions, &c.), as well as Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t:--'May Agni offer
Agni's favourite dainties!' thereby he refers to Agni's
butter-portion <span id="fr_465"></span>[3](#fn_462.md). 'May he offer
Soma's favourite dainties!' thereby he refers to Soma's
butter-portion.--'May he offer Agni's favourite dainties!' thereby he
refers to that indispensable cake for Agni which is (offered) on both
occasions (at the new- and full-moon sacrifices).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:11">1:7:3:11</span></span>11. And
so with the several deities. 'May he offer the favourite dainties of
butter-drinking gods!' thereby he refers to the fore-offerings
(prayâ*g*a) and after-offerings (anuyâ*g*a), for, assuredly, the
butter-drinking gods (represent) the fore-offerings and
after-offerings.--'May he offer Agni the Hot*ri*'s

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

favourite dainties!' thereby he refers to Agni as Hot*ri*; for after the
gods had set apart this oblation for him, they still further propitiated
him by this (formula), and invited him to his favourite dainty <span
id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_463.md): this is the reason why he thus
enumerates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:12">1:7:3:12</span></span>12.
Here now some make (the name of) the deity precede the 'may he offer
(ayâ*t*)!' thus--'Of Agni may he offer (the favourite dainties)!' 'Of
Soma may he offer!' But let him not do this; for those who make the
deity precede the 'may he offer!' violate the proper order at the
sacrifice, since it is by pronouncing the 'may he offer,' that he
pronounces what comes first here: let him therefore place the 'may he
offer' first.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:13">1:7:3:13</span></span>13.
\[The Hot*ri* continues to recite\]: 'May he sacrifice to his own
greatness!' When, on that occasion <span
id="fr_467"></span>[2](#fn_464), he asks him (Agni.md) to bring hither the
deities, he also makes him bring hither his own greatness; but before
this no worship of any kind has been offered to 'his (Agni's) own
greatness:' and he therefore now gratifies him, and thus that (fire) has
been established so as to prevent failure on his (the sacrificer's)
part. This is the reason why he says 'may he sacrifice to his own
greatness.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:14">1:7:3:14</span></span>14. 'By
sacrifice may he obtain for himself food worthy of sacrifice <span
id="fr_468"></span>[3](#fn_465.md)!' the food, doubtless, is these
creatures: he thereby makes them eager to sacrifice, and these creatures
go on sacrificing, worshipping and performing austerities.

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:15">1:7:3:15</span></span>15.
'May he, the knower of beings, (perform) <span
id="fr_469"></span>[1](#fn_466.md) the sacred cult; may he graciously
accept the sacrificial food!' Thereby he prays for success to this
sacrifice; for when the gods graciously accept the sacrificial food,
then he (the sacrificer) gains great things <span
id="fr_470"></span>[2](#fn_467.md): for this reason he says 'may he
graciously accept the sacrificial food!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:16">1:7:3:16</span></span>16. The
reason why on this occasion the invitatory and offering-formulas are
made closely to correspond to each other (avak*li*ptatama), is that the
svish*t*ak*ri*t (is equivalent to) the evening libation, and the evening
libation, doubtless, belongs to the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* (the 'All-gods
) <span id="fr_471"></span>[3](#fn_468.md). 'Gladden thou the longing gods,
O youngest!' this much in the invitatory formula refers to the Vi*s*ve
Devâ*h* <span id="fr_472"></span>[4](#fn_469.md). 'O Agni, Hot*ri* of the
cult! when this day (thou comest) to the men <span
id="fr_473"></span>[5](#fn_470.md);' this much in the offering-formula
refers to the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*. And because such is the form of these two
(formulas), therefore they are of

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

the form of the evening libation; and this is why the invitatory and
offering-formulas on this occasion are made closely to correspond to
each other.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:17">1:7:3:17</span></span>17.
They are both trish*t*ubh verses; for the svish*t*ak*ri*t is, as it
were, the residue (or site, vâstu) of the sacrifice, and the residue
(or, a vacant site) is without energy <span
id="fr_474"></span>[1](#fn_471.md). Now the trish*t*ubh means manly
power <span id="fr_475"></span>[2](#fn_472.md), energy: hence he thereby
imparts manly power, energy to that residue, the svish*t*ak*ri*t. This
is why they are both trish*t*ubh verses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:18">1:7:3:18</span></span>18. Or
they are both anush*t*ubh verses. The anush*t*ubh is residue (or site,
vâstu), and the svish*t*ak*ri*t also is residue: hence he thereby puts a
residue to a residue <span id="fr_476"></span>[3](#fn_473.md). And, verily,
one who knows this, and whose (invitatory and offering-formulas) are two
anush*t*ubh verses, his homestead (vâstu) is prosperous, and he himself
prospers in regard to progeny and cattle.

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:19">1:7:3:19</span></span>19. Now
here Bhâllabeya <span id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_474.md) made the
invitatory formula (consist of) an anush*t*ubh verse, and the
offering-formula of a trish*t*ubh verse, thinking, 'I thus obtain (the
benefits of) both.' He fell from the cart, and in falling, broke his
arm. He reflected: 'This has befallen because of something or other I
have done.' He then bethought himself of this: '(It has befallen)
because of some violation, on my part, of the proper course of the
sacrifice.' Hence one must not violate the proper course (of sacrificial
performance); but let both (formulas) be verses of the same metre,
either both anush*t*ubh verses, or both trish*t*ubh verses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:20">1:7:3:20</span></span>20. He
cuts (the portions for Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t) from the north part (of the
sacrificial dishes) <span id="fr_478"></span>[2](#fn_475.md), and offers
them up on the north part (of the fire): for this is the region of that
god, and therefore he cuts from the north part and offers on the north
part. From that side, indeed, he arose <span
id="fr_479"></span>[3](#fn_476), and there they (the gods.md) appeased him:
for this reason he cuts from the north part, and offers on the north
part.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:21">1:7:3:21</span></span>21. He
offers on this side (in front), as it were, of the other oblations.
Following the other oblations cattle are produced, and the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t represents Rudra's power: he would impose Rudra's power
on

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

the cattle if he were to bring it (the Svish*t*ak*ri*t) into contact
with the other oblations; and his (the sacrificer's) household and
cattle would be destroyed. For this reason he offers on this side, as it
were, of the other oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:22">1:7:3:22</span></span>22.
That (fire)---to wit, the Âhavanîya--is, indeed, that sacrifice by which
the gods then ascended to heaven; and that (other fire) which was left
behind here, is the Gârhapatya: hence they take out the former from the
Gârhapatya, (so as to be) before (east) of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:23">1:7:3:23</span></span>23. He
may lay it (the Âhavanîya) down at the distance of eight steps (from the
Gârhapatya); for of eight syllables, doubtless, consists the gâyatrî
hence he thereby ascends to heaven by means of the gâyatrî.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:24">1:7:3:24</span></span>24. Or
he may lay it down at the distance of eleven steps <span
id="fr_480"></span>[1](#fn_477.md); for of eleven syllables, indeed,
consists the trish*t*ubh: hence he thereby ascends to heaven by means of
the trish*t*ubh.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:25">1:7:3:25</span></span>25. Or
he may lay it down at the distance of twelve steps; for of twelve
syllables, indeed, consists the *g*aga: hence he thereby ascends to
heaven by means of the *g*agatî. Here, however, there is no (fixed)
measure: let him, therefore, lay it down where in his own mind he may
think proper <span id="fr_481"></span>[2](#fn_478.md). If he takes it ever
so little east (of the Gârhapatya), he ascends to heaven by it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:26">1:7:3:26</span></span>26.
Here now they say, 'Let them cook the sacrificial

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

dishes on the Âhavanîya; for thence, assuredly, the gods ascended to
heaven, and therewith they went on worshipping and toiling: therein we
will cook the sacrificial dishes; therein we will perform the sacrifice!
For, as it were, a displacement <span id="fr_482"></span>[1](#fn_479.md) of
the sacrificial dishes would take place, if they were to cook them on
the Gârhapatya. The Âhavanîya is the sacrifice: we will perform the
sacrifice in the sacrifice!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:27">1:7:3:27</span></span>27.
However, they also do cook on the Gârhapatya, arguing, 'The former is
indeed âhavanîya (i.e. "suitable for a burnt-offering"); but that one,
surely, is not (intended) for this,--viz. that they should cook uncooked
(food) on it; but it is (intended) for this,--viz. that they should
offer up cooked (food) on it.' He may therefore do it on whichever
(fire) he pleases.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:3:28">1:7:3:28</span></span>28.
That sacrifice spake, 'I dread nakedness.' 'What is unnakedness for
thee?' 'Let them strew (sacrificial grass) all round me!' For this
reason they strew (sacrificial grass) all round the fire. 'I dread
thirst.' 'How art thou to be satiated?' 'May I satiate myself after the
priest has been satisfied!' Let him therefore, on the completion of the
sacrifice, order that the priest be satisfied; for then he satisfies the
sacrifice.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_456"></span>[200:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_459.md) Or perhaps, he was
left behind with, or in, the remains (of the sacrifice);' vâstu being
evidently also taken in this sense by our author, in par. 7.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[200:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_460.md) The text has
ayatayâ merely, which, to become intelligible, clearly requires some
noun, which may have been lost here. Sâya*n*a is silent on this point.
In Dr. Muir's version of the legend, Original Sanskrit Texts, IV, p.
202, the word is left untranslated. I am inclined to supply some such
noun as heti, 'weapon;' cf. XII, 7, 3, 20, where this very word is used
in connection with Rudra: in later times it is also specially applied to
Agni's weapon or flame (*g*ihvâ, 'tongue'). It is not impossible,
however, that we have to supply tanvâ ('with his raised body, or self').
To mâ vi srâkshî*h* (for which the Kâ*n*va recension reads mâ ’sthâ*h*),
'do not hurl,' and to sa*m*vivarha ('he drew back'), Sâya*n*a supplies
ya*gñ*am, 'sacrifice:' hence he apparently takes it thus,--'do not
scatter (the sacrifice),'--'he kept (the sacrifice) together and did not
injure it in any way.'

<span id="fn_458"></span>[201:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_461.md) On the
identification of Agni with Rudra, see also VI, 1, 3, 7; and Muir,
Original Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 339 seq.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[201:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_462.md) Passages such as
this and VI, 1, 3, 7 seq. are of considerable interest, as showing, on
the one hand, the tendency towards identifying and blending originally
distinct and apparently local Vedic gods, especially Rudra, with the
person of Agni, the representative of the divine power on earth in the
later Vedic triad; and, on the other hand, the origin of the conception
of Siva, in the pantheistic system of the post-Vedic period. On our
passage, see also Weber, Ind. Stud. II, p. 37; I, p. 189; Muir, Original
Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 328.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[202:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_463.md) That is, according
to Sâya*n*a, on the Âhavanîya fire-place.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[202:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_464.md) The anuvâkyâ for
the Svish*t*ak*ri*t is Rig-veda X, 2, 1: piprîhi devân̐ u*s*ato
yavish*th*a ('gladden thou the longing gods, O youngest!') &c. Â*s*v. S.
I, 6, 2.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[202:3](sbe1232.htm#fr_465.md) See I, 4, 2, 16-17.
These formulas (nigada) of enumeration (aya*d* agnir agne*h* priyâ
dhâmâni, &c.--yakshad agner hotu*h* priyâ dhâmâni, &c.) form part of the
offering-formula. The yâ*g*yâ proper, however, which they precede is
Rig-veda VI, 15, 14, agne yad adya vi*s*o adhvarasya hota*h* \['O Agni,
Hot*ri* of the cult! when this day (thou comest) to the men '\], &c.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[203:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_466.md) Or, resort, abode,
dhâman.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[203:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_467.md) Viz. at the
'devatânâm âvahanam,' cf. I, 4, 2, 17; [p. 118](sbe1218.htm#page_118.md),
n. [1](sbe1218.htm#fn_307.md).

<span id="fn_465"></span>[203:3](sbe1232.htm#fr_468.md) 'Âya*g*atâm e*g*yâ
isha*h*.' Mahîdhara, on Vâ*g*. S. XXI, 47, interprets it thus: 'May
these (isha*h*) desirous (creatures), fit for sacrifice, sacrifice
properly!' Similarly perhaps Sâya*n*a on our passage.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[204:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_469.md) Here k*rin*otu is
omitted in the text, but cf. Vâ*g*. S. XXI, 47; Taitt. Br. III, 5, 7, 6;
Â*s*v. *S*. I, 6, 5. Dr. Hillebrandt, Altind. Neu- and Vollmondsopfer,
p. 11 [construes](errata.htm#6.md) it with the preceding formula: 'er mache
darbringungswerth die Speisen; er, der Wesenkenner, nehme beim Opfer das
havis an.' (?)

<span id="fn_467"></span>[204:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_470.md) Mahat, 'grosses.'

<span id="fn_468"></span>[204:3](sbe1232.htm#fr_471.md) See Vâ*g*. S. XIX,
26. Here the author, as usual (cf. p. 5 note), attempts to enhance the
solemnity of the ceremony by identifying it with the t*ri*tîya-savana,
or evening libation at the Soma-sacrifice, both offerings constituting
the final ceremonies in the main performance of the respective
sacrifices. We shall, however, see (cf. I, 8, 3, 25) that as at the
evening libation the remains of the Soma are offered up, so also are the
remains of havis offered to the vi*s*ve devâ*h* at the conclusion of the
present sacrifice. At IV, 4, 5, 17 it is more especially the offering of
rice-cake to Agni and Varu*n*a, at the evening libation, which is
identified with the svish*t*ak*ri*t.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[204:4](sbe1232.htm#fr_472.md) See [p.
202](#page_202), note [2](#fn_461.md).

<span id="fn_471"></span>[205:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_474.md) Avîryam; cf. II, 1,
2, 9, where the (*s*arîra) empty body (of Pra*g*âpati) is called a vâstu
aya*gñ*iyam avîryam. See also above, I, 7, 3, 7, where we met with vâstu
in the sense of 'remainder, that which remains,' as Sâya*n*a also seems
to take it here.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[205:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_475.md) Indriyam, literally
'Indra's power.' The trish*t*ubh often (e*g*. Rig-veda X, 130, 5)
appears specially related to Indra; and the hymns addressed to him are
almost entirely in this metre. Taitt. S. VII, 1, 1, 4 it is said to have
been created by Pra*g*âpati from his own chest and arms, immediately
after Indra, and together with the B*ri*hat-sâman, the Râ*g*anya, and
the ram; and that these are therefore vîryâvant, having been created out
of vîrya (i.e. the seats of 'manly power').

<span id="fn_473"></span>[205:3](sbe1232.htm#fr_476.md) For this symbolical
explanation see Taitt. S. VII, 1, 1, 5, where the anush*t*ubh is said to
have been created by Pra*g*âpati, by his fourth and last creative act,
from his feet, together with the Vairâ*g*a-sâman, the *S*ûdra, and the
horse; the two last named being, therefore, styled 'bhûta-saṅkrâmin (?
subservient to creatures).' I do not find it stated anywhere, what
anush*t*ubh verses may optionally be taken for the anuvâkyâ and yâ*g*yâ
of the svish*t*ak*ri*t.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[206:1](sbe1232.htm#fr_477.md) That is,
Indradyumna Bhâllabeya, as the Kâ*n*va recension reads here and II, 1,
4, 6. Cf. X, 6, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[206:2](sbe1232.htm#fr_478.md) He makes, as usual,
an under-layer (upastara*n*a) of butter in the *g*uhû; cuts a piece from
the north part of each of the two cakes (or of the one cake and of both
the sweet and the sour milk constituting the sânnâyya); and thereupon
bastes the pieces twice (not once) with butter.

construct his Âhavanîya fire at the distance of eight prakramas (step of
two padas or feet each) to the east of the Gârhapatya, the Râ*g*anya at
the distance of eleven, and the Vai*s*ya at the distance of twelve,
steps. Thibaut, Pandit X, p. 22.

takes skhala to mean winnowing- (or threshing-) floor (? khala): hence
apaskhala would mean 'the leaping (of the husk, &c.) out of the
winnowing-floor.' The Kâ*n*va MS. reads, 'apaskhala iva sa havishâ*m*
yad gârhapatya*h*' (? 'the Gârhapatya is to the sacrificial food the
outside of a winnowing-floor, as it were.')
