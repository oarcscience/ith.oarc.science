### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### SÛKTAVÂKA, SA*M*YUVÂKA, AND OFFERING OF REMAINS <span id="fr_557"></span>[2](#fn_553.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:1">1:8:3:1</span></span>1. He now
separates the two spoons (*g*uhû and upabh*ri*t), with the text (Vâ*g*.
S. II, 15 a), 'May I be victorious after the victory of Agni and Soma!
with the impetus of the (sacrificial) food I urge myself on.' With his
right hand he moves the *g*uhû eastwards (from its usual place on the
prastara-bunch upon the altar), with the text (ib. b), 'May Agni and
Soma drive him away who hates us, and whom

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

we hate! with the impetus of the (sacrificial) food I drive him away.'
With his left hand he moves the upabh*ri*t westwards (from its place on
the barhis to outside the altar):--Thus, if the sacrificer himself (does
it) <span id="fr_558"></span>[1](#fn_554.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:2">1:8:3:2</span></span>2. And if
the Adhvaryu (does it, he says), 'May this sacrificer be victorious
after the victory of Agni and Soma! with the impetus of the food I urge
him on;' and, 'May Agni and Soma drive him away whom this sacrificer
hates, and who hates him! with the impetus of the food I drive him
away.' Thus he does at the full-moon sacrifice, because the full-moon
offering belongs to Agni and Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:3">1:8:3:3</span></span>3. At the
new-moon sacrifice, on the other hand, he uses the texts (ib. c, d),
'May I be victorious after the victory of Indra and Agni <span
id="fr_559"></span>[2](#fn_555.md)! with the impetus of the food I urge
myself on;' and, 'May Indra and Agni drive him away who hates us, and
whom we hate! with the impetus of the food I drive him away:'--Thus, if
the sacrificer himself does it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:4">1:8:3:4</span></span>4. And if
the Adhvaryu (does it, he says), 'May this sacrificer be victorious
after the victory of Indra and Agni! with the impetus of the food I urge
him on;' and, 'May Indra and Agni drive him away whom this sacrificer
hates, and who hates him! with the impetus of the food I drive him
away.' Thus he says at the new-moon sacrifice, because the new-moon

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

offering belongs to Indra and Agni. And in this manner he separates (the
spoons) according to the respective deities, This is why he thus
separates them:

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:5">1:8:3:5</span></span>5. Behind
the *g*uhû stands the sacrificer, and behind the upabh*ri*t stands he
who means evil to him: hereby, then, he brings the sacrificer forward to
the front (or east), and the one who means evil him he drives back (or
towards the west). Behind the *g*uhû stands the eater (enjoyer), and
behind the upabh*ri*t the one to be eaten (enjoyed): thus he now brings
the eater (enjoyer) to the front, and the one to be eaten (enjoyed) he
drives back.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:6">1:8:3:6</span></span>6. Thus
the separation (of the eater and the eaten) is effected in one and the
same act; and hence from one and the same man spring both the enjoyer
(the husband), and the one to be enjoyed (the wife): for now kinsfolk
(gâtyâ*h*) live sporting and rejoicing together, saying, 'In the fourth
(or) third man (I.e. generation) we unite <span
id="fr_560"></span>[1](#fn_556.md).' And this is so in accordance with that
(separation of the spoons).

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:7">1:8:3:7</span></span>7.
Thereupon (the Adhvaryu) anoints the enclosing-sticks (paridhi) with
(the butter attaching to) the *g*uhû. With that (spoon) with which he
has made offering to the gods, with which he has concluded the
sacrifice, he thus gratifies the enclosing-sticks: this is why he
anoints them with the *g*uhû.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:8">1:8:3:8</span></span>8. He
anoints them (successively) <span id="fr_561"></span>[1](#fn_557.md), with
the texts (Vâ*g*. S. II, 16 a-c), 'For the Vasus thee!' 'For the Rudras
thee!' 'For the Âdityas thee!' For these--to wit, the Vasus, Rudras, and
Âdityas--are three (classes of) gods: 'for them (I anoint) thee,' he
thereby says.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:9">1:8:3:9</span></span>9.
Thereupon, taking hold of the (middle) enclosing-stick, he calls (on the
Âgnîdhra) to bid (them) listen <span id="fr_562"></span>[2](#fn_558.md):
thus (i.e. by touching the paridhi) it is for the enclosing-sticks that
he calls for the *s*rausha*t*. The *s*rausha*t*-call assuredly is the
sacrifice: hence he thereby expressly gladdens the enclosing-sticks by
means of the sacrifice: for this reason he calls for the *s*rausha*t*,
while taking hold of the enclosing-stick.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:10">1:8:3:10</span></span>10.
Having called for the *s*rausha*t* (and been responded to by the
Âgnîdhra), he thus addresses (the Hot*ri*), 'The divine Hot*ri*s <span
id="fr_563"></span>[3](#fn_559.md) are summoned--,' the divine Hot*ri*s,
namely, are (represented by) these

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

enclosing-sticks, since these are Agnis (fires) <span
id="fr_564"></span>[1](#fn_560.md). When he says, 'the divine Hot*ri*s are
summoned (ishita),' he means to say, 'the divine Hot*ri*s are wished for
(ish*t*a).' \[He continues\], '--for the proclamation of success <span
id="fr_565"></span>[2](#fn_561.md),'--for on this the gods themselves are
indeed intent, to wit, that they should speak what is favourable
(conducive to success, sâdhu), that they should do what is favourable:
hence he says 'for the proclamation of success.'--'The human one is
called upon for the song of praise (sûktavâka) <span
id="fr_566"></span>[3](#fn_562.md)!' by these words he urges on this human
Hot*ri* to singing praises.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:11">1:8:3:11</span></span>11. He
now takes the prastara-bunch <span id="fr_567"></span>[4](#fn_563.md). The
prastara assuredly is the sacrificer: hence whithersoever his sacrifice
went, thither he thereby wishes him good-speed <span
id="fr_568"></span>[5](#fn_564.md)! Now it is to the world of the gods that
his sacrifice went; and to the world of the gods accordingly he thereby
takes the sacrificer.

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:12">1:8:3:12</span></span>12.
Should he desire rain, let him take up (the prastara), with this text
(Vâ*g*. S. II, 16 d), 'Be ye in harmony with each other, O heaven and
earth!' for when heaven and earth are in harmony with each other, then
indeed it rains <span id="fr_569"></span>[1](#fn_565.md): for this reason
he says, 'be ye in harmony with each other, O heaven and earth!'--'May
Mitra and Varu*n*a favour thee with rain!' whereby he says, 'may he who
rules over the rain favour thee with rain!' Now he that rules over the
rain is undoubtedly that blowing one (Vâyu, the wind); and he, it is
true, blows as one only; but, on entering into man, he becomes a forward
and a backward moving one; and they are these two, the out-breathing and
the in-breathing. And Mitra and Varu*n*a assuredly are the out-breathing
and in-breathing; and hence he says by that (prayer), 'may he who rules
over the rain favour thee with rain!' Let him then take it up, with this
text, for then the rain will at all times be propitious. He anoints it
(the prastara): thereby he makes him (the sacrificer) an oblation,
thinking, 'May he, as an oblation, go to the world of the gods!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:13">1:8:3:13</span></span>13. He
anoints the top (of the prastara with the butter) in the *g*uhû, the
middle part (with that) in the upabh*ri*t, and the lower end (with that)
in the dhruvâ; for the *g*uhû is, as it were, the top, the upabh*ri*t
the middle, and the dhruvâ the root.

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:14">1:8:3:14</span></span>14. He
anoints (each time), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 16 e), 'May (the gods)
eat, licking the anointed bird <span id="fr_570"></span>[1](#fn_566.md)!'
He thereby causes it (the prastara and hence symbolically the
sacrificer) to be a bird and fly up from this world of men to the world
of the gods. He then draws it twice (towards the Âhavanîya) alow (near
the ground). The reason why he must draw it alow (is this): the prastara
is the sacrificer; and in this way he does not remove him from this firm
footing of his; and he, moreover, secures rain for this locality.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:15">1:8:3:15</span></span>15. He
draws it along, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 16 f), 'Go to the spotted
(mares) of the Maruts!' He means to say, 'Go to the world of the gods,'
when he says, 'Go to the spotted (mares) of the Maruts <span
id="fr_571"></span>[2](#fn_567.md)!'--'Having become a spotted cow, go to
the sky and thence bring us rain hither!' The spotted cow, doubtless, is
this (earth): whatever rooted and rootless food is here on this (earth),
by that this (earth) is a spotted cow. 'Having become

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

this (earth), go thou to the sky!' this is what he thereby says. 'Thence
bring us rain hither!' From rain certainly spring vigour, sap,
well-being: for this reason he says, 'thence bring us rain hither!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:16">1:8:3:16</span></span>16. He
then takes a single stalk from it. The prastara-bunch is the sacrificer;
and therefore, if he were to throw the whole prastara (at once) into the
fire, the sacrificer would speedily go to yonder world. In this way,
however, the sacrificer will live long; and what the full measure of
human life here on earth is, for that he takes this (single stalk)
therefrom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:17">1:8:3:17</span></span>17.
Having held (the prastara) for a moment, he throws it into the fire:
whither his (the sacrificer's) one (part of) self (or, body) <span
id="fr_572"></span>[1](#fn_568.md) went, thither he thereby causes it to
go <span id="fr_573"></span>[2](#fn_569.md). But were he not to throw it
into the fire, he would cut off the sacrificer from (yonder) world. In
this way, however, he does not cut off the sacrificer from (yonder)
world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:18">1:8:3:18</span></span>18. He
throws it (with its top) to the east, for the east is the region of the
gods; or to the north, for the north is the region of man. With the
fingers only they should smooth it down, not with pieces of wood; since
it is with sticks that they pierce any other corpse. Fearing, lest they
should treat it in the same way as any other corpse, they should smooth
it down with the fingers only, not with pieces of wood. When the Hot*ri*
recites the song of praise,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:19">1:8:3:19</span></span>19. The
Âgnîdhra says (to the Adhvaryu), 'Throw

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the single stalk)
after (the prastara)!'--'whither his (the sacrificer's) other self went,
thither make it now go,' this is what he thereby says. \[The Adhvaryu\]
having thrown it silently after, touches himself <span
id="fr_574"></span>[1](#fn_570), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 16 f.md):
'Guardian of the eye art thou, O Agni; guard mine eye!' In this way also
he does not throw himself into the fire after (the prastara or
sacrificer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:20">1:8:3:20</span></span>20. He
(the Âgnîdhra) then says <span id="fr_575"></span>[2](#fn_571.md) (to the
Adhvaryu), 'Discourse together!'--he thereby says, 'Make him (the
sacrificer) discourse with the gods.' \[The Adhvaryu asks\], 'Has he
gone (to the gods), Agnîdh?' whereby he says, 'Has he really gone?'--'He
has gone!' replies the other.--'Bid (the gods) hear!' by these words he
(the Adhvaryu) means to say, 'Make him (the sacrificer) be heard, make
him be noticed by the gods!'--'May (one or they) hear (srausha*t*)!'
thereby he (the Âgnîdhra) means to say, 'They know him, they have
recognised him.' Thus the Adhvaryu and the Âgnîdhra lead the sacrificer
to the world of the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:21">1:8:3:21</span></span>21. He
(the Adhvaryu) then says, 'Good-speed to the divine Hot*ri*s <span
id="fr_576"></span>[3](#fn_572.md)!' The divine Hot*ri*s assuredly are
these enclosing-sticks, since these are Agnis (fires): it is to them
that he thereby bids good-speed, and therefore he says, 'good-speed to
the

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

divine Hot*ri*s!'--'Success (svasti) to the human!' thereby he desires
that this human Hot*ri* may not fail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:22">1:8:3:22</span></span>22. He
now throws the enclosing-sticks into the fire. The middle
enclosing-stick he throws first, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 17 a),
'The stick which thou laidst around thee, O divine Agni, when thou wert
concealed by the Pa*n*is, I bring thee for thy pleasure; may it not
prove faithless to thee!'--With (ib. b), 'Approach ye the place beloved
of Agni!' he throws the two others after it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:23">1:8:3:23</span></span>23. He
then <span id="fr_577"></span>[1](#fn_573.md) seizes the *g*uha and the
upabh*ri*t at the same time. For on the former occasion <span
id="fr_578"></span>[2](#fn_574.md), when he anoints (the prastara
sacrificer), he makes him an oblation, thinking, 'May he, as an
oblation, go to the world of the gods!' for this reason he seizes the
*g*uhû and the upabh*ri*t at the same time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:24">1:8:3:24</span></span>24. He
seizes them for the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* (the All-gods). For, assuredly, when
any sacrificial food is taken without being announced to any one deity,
then all the gods think that they have a share in it. Now when he takes
that sacrificial food, the (residue of) butter, he does not announce it
to any one deity; and hence he takes up (the two spoons) for the Vi*s*ve
Devâ*h*, and thus makes that (residue of butter) the vai*s*vadeva <span
id="fr_579"></span>[3](#fn_575.md) at the havirya*gñ*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:25">1:8:3:25</span></span>25. He
seizes them, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 18),

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'The residue (of
the butter) ye have for your share, ye, mighty by (this) food!' the
residue, of course, is that which remains;--'O ye gods, staying on the
prastara, and representing the enclosing-sticks <span
id="fr_580"></span>[1](#fn_576.md);' for both the prastara and the
enclosing-sticks have been thrown into the fire;--'All of you,
applauding this speech,' thereby he makes it the vai*s*vadeva (belonging
to the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*);--'Be seated on this couch of grass (barhis) and
enjoy yourselves! Svâhâ! Vâ*t* <span id="fr_581"></span>[2](#fn_577.md)!'
as one offers what has been consecrated by 'vasha*t*,' this (residue)
thereby becomes such for him (the sacrificer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:26">1:8:3:26</span></span>26. For
whomsoever they take the sacrificial food from a cart, for him they
unyoke (the spoons, by placing them) on the yoke of that cart, thinking,
'Where we yoke, there we also unyoke <span
id="fr_582"></span>[3](#fn_578.md);' for from the same place where they
yoke, they also unyoke. For him, on the other hand, for whom they take
it from a jar, (they unyoke the spoons, by placing them) on the wooden
sword, thinking, 'Where we yoke, there we also unyoke;' for from the
same place where they yoke, they also unyoke.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:3:27">1:8:3:27</span></span>27.
Yoke-fellows, indeed, are these two spoons for the sacrifice: he yokes
them when he starts <span id="fr_583"></span>[4](#fn_579.md) (or,

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

first uses them). Now, were he only to release (unyoke) either of them
after putting it down, it would fall down just as a draught animal <span
id="fr_584"></span>[1](#fn_580.md) (would, if made to lie down before being
unyoked). At the Svish*t*ak*ri*t these two undergo an unyoking: he then
lays them down, and so unyokes them. He then yokes them again, at the
after-offerings. Having performed the after-offerings, he effects
another unyoking: he lays them down, and so unyokes them. Thereupon he
yokes them again when he seizes them both at the same time; and when he
has travelled over the way for which he has yoked them, he unyokes them.
After the sacrifice offspring (is produced). Hence this man yokes
(unites), and then unyokes, and again yokes them; and when he has
travelled over the way for which he yoked them, he finally unyokes them.
He lays (the spoons) down, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 19 a), 'Fond of
butter are ye; protect the two yoke-fellows! gracious are ye: lead me to
grace!' whereby he says, 'good are ye: lead me to goodness!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_553"></span>[236:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_557.md) The whole of the
third Brâhma*n*a is taken up with the duties of the Adhvaryu and
Âgnîdhra at the three ceremonies: paragraphs 1-19 with those at the
sûktavâka; pars. 20-22 with those at the *s*a*m*yuvâka; and pars. 23-27
with those at the offering of the remains (sa*m*srava) of butter. The
duties of the Hot*ri* are then detailed in the fourth Brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_554"></span>[237:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_558.md) In Taitt. Br. III,
3, 9 a different symbolical explanation is given of the separation of
the spoons: it is said there that by shifting the *g*uhû eastwards, he
drives away the enemies that have been born; and by shifting the
upabh*ri*t towards the west, he drives away those that will be born
hereafter; and the sacrificer then stands firmly established in this
world.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[237:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_559.md) See [p.
162](sbe1227.htm#page_162), note [3](sbe1227.htm#fn_378.md).

<span id="fn_556"></span>[238:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_560.md) This passage is of
considerable importance, as showing that the prohibition of
intermarriage between near blood-relations,--so rigidly enforced in
later times, and already formulated in passages such as Âpast. Dharm.
II, 5, 15, 16, 'One must not give one's daughter to a man belonging to
the same gotra. Nor to one related (within six degrees) on the mother's
(or father's) side.' Gobh. III, 4, 3-5, 'One must take for one's wife
one who is not of the same gotra, or one who is not sapi*nd*a to one's
mother,'--was not as yet firmly established in our author's time.
Harisvâmin remarks on our text, that the Kâ*n*vas allow intermarriage in
such cases from the third generation--(the Kâ*n*va text of the *S*at.
Br. reads, 'In the third man we unite, in the fourth man we unite')--and
the Saurâsh*t*ras from the fourth generation; and that the
Dâkshi*n*âtyas allow marriage with daughters of the mother's brother,
<span id="page_239">p. 239</span> and with sons of the father's sister.
See Weber, Ind. Stud. X, p. 75; Max Müller, History of Ancient Sanskrit
Literature, p. 387; Bühler, Sacred Laws of the Âryas, I, p. 126.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[239:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_561.md) Viz. in the order
in which they were laid around, i.e. first the middle one, then the
southern, and lastly the northern one. Kâty. III, 5, 24.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[239:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_562.md) The Adhvaryu calls
on the Âgnîdhra with Make listen (o *s*râvaya);' and the latter responds
with 'Yea, may (one) listen! (astu *s*rausha*t*).' See I, 5, 2, 18 seq.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[239:3](sbe1236.htm#fr_563.md) Sâya*n*a on Taitt.
S. I, 1, 13 explains this by 'Impelled are the divine Hot*ri*s by the
highest Lord (parame*s*vara).'

<span id="fn_560"></span>[240:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_564.md) On the Agnis
officiating as Hot*ri*, I, 2, 3, 1.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[240:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_565.md) Thus Sâya*n*a
explains bhadravâ*k*yâya on Taitt. S. I, 1, 13 (vol. i. p. 233). For the
Hot*ri*'s formula itself, see *S*at. Br. I, 9, 1, 4.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[240:3](sbe1236.htm#fr_566.md) According to Kâty.
III, 6, 1, and the other Sûtras, the Adhvaryu adds here sûktâ brûhi,
'recite the praises (hymns)!' which Sâya*n*a on Taitt. Br. III, 6, 15
combines with the preceding sûktavâkâya, and explains thus: 'hotâ tva*m*
sûktasya vâko va*k*ana*m* yasya so ’ya*m* deva*h* sûktavâka*h* (? i.e.
Agni, cf. *S*at. Br. I, 9, 1, 4) tasmai sûktavâkâya devâya sûktâ brûhi,
ida*m* dyâvâp*ri*thivîm anuvâkoktâni *s*obhanâni va*k*anâni kathaya
(!);' but differently on Taitt. S. I, 1, 13, 'ida*m* dyâvâp*ri*thivî
bhadram abhûd (Taitt. Br. III, 5, 10) ityâdyanuvâka*h* sûktam, tasya
vâko va*k*anam, tadartham mânusho hotâ preshita*h*; ato heto*h*, he
hotas tat sûktam brûhi.'

<span id="fn_563"></span>[240:4](sbe1236.htm#fr_567.md) The two stalks,
called vidh*ri*ti (separation), separating the prastara-bunch from the
barhis or grass-covering of the altar (cf. I, 3, 4, in), he puts back in
the place whence they were taken. Kâty. III, 6, 4.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[240:5](sbe1236.htm#fr_568.md) Svagâ.? literally
'self-go,' i.e.' success to him!'

<span id="fn_565"></span>[241:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_569.md) Cf. Ait. Âr. III,
I, 2, 2-4 (Max Müller, Up. I, p. 249): 'The first half (of a sa*m*hitâ
or combination of final and initial letters) is the earth, the second
half heaven, their uniting the rain, the uniter Par*g*anya. And so it is
when he (Par*g*anya) rains thus strongly, without ceasing, day and
night; then they say also (in ordinary language), "Heaven and earth have
come together."' See also *S*at. Br. I, 7, 2, 16.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[242:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_570.md) Vyantu vayo ’kta*m*
rihâ*n*â*h*. Mahîdhara interprets it, 'May the birds (i.e. the metres)
go (? to heaven,--taking and) licking the anointed (prastara).' The
Kâ*n*vas read, 'vyantu vayo ripto rihâ*n*â*h*.' The Black Ya*g*us
(Taitt. S. I, 1, 13, 1) has 'akta*m* rihâ*n*â viyantu vaya*h*,
pra*g*â*m* yoni*m* mâ nirm*ri*ksham, âpyâyantâm âpa oshadhaya*h*,' which
Sâya*n*a explains by 'May the birds having licked the anointed (top) go
their several ways,' &c.; and the Taitt. Br. III, 3, 9, 3 remarks to
viyantu vaya*h*, 'Having made him birds, he makes him go to the heavenly
world.' According to Sâya*n*a, the three above formulas are by Âpastamba
referred to the three acts of anointing, whereas the others, he says,
divide the first formula into two, and use the second one (pra*g*âm,
&c.) while the lower part of the prastara is anointed. See, however,
Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollm. p. 142, note 3.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[242:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_571.md) The Black Ya*g*us
(Taitt. S. I, 1, 13) has, 'The spotted (mares) of the Maruts are ye (O
plants)!'

<span id="fn_568"></span>[243:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_572.md) The itara âtmâ in
pars. 27 and 19 have to be taken correlatively.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[243:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_573.md) That is to say, he
makes sure that the sacrificer has really obtained the object for which
the sacrifice was undertaken,--the right to go to the heavenly world
after his death.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[244:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_574.md) He touches himself
near the heart, or, according to Vaidyanâtha, he touches his eyes. After
this he has, as usual, to touch the lustral water. See [p.
2](sbe1203.htm#page_2), note [2](sbe1203.htm#fn_84.md).

<span id="fn_571"></span>[244:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_575.md) Here begins the
*s*a*m*yuvâka; see [p. 241](#page_241), note [1](#fn_565.md).

<span id="fn_572"></span>[244:3](sbe1236.htm#fr_576.md) 'Svagâ´ daívyâ
hôt*ri*bhya*h*.' The form daivyâ seems to have become fixed before
hot*ri*, in consequence of its frequent use, especially in the Âprî
hymns, as nom. acc. dual daívyâ hótârâ; and in the invocation of the
I*d*â, as nom. plur. daívyâ hótâra*h*.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[245:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_577.md) Here begins the
offering of the remains (sa*m*srava) of butter; see [p.
236](sbe1235.htm#page_236), note [2](#fn_553.md).

<span id="fn_574"></span>[245:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_578.md) See par. 14 above.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[245:3](sbe1236.htm#fr_579.md) The author again
connects the havis-offering with the more solemn Soma-sacrifice; the
third, or evening, libation of Soma being supposed to belong to the
Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*; cf. Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 26; Ait. Br. VI, 4.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[246:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_580.md) Paridheyâ*h*,
literally 'ye who are to be laid around;' according to Mahîdhara =
paridhibhavâ*h*. The Kâ*n*va text has paridhaya*h*, 'enclosing-sticks.'
The Black Ya*g*us (Taitt. S. I, 1, 13, 2) has 'barhishada*h* (sitting on
the Barhis)' instead.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[246:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_581.md) The original
meaning of this sacrificial call, as of the apparently allied vasha*t*,
vausha*t*, appears to be, 'May he (Agni) carry it (the oblation to the
deity)!' Cf. [p. 88](sbe1214.htm#page_88), note [2](sbe1214.htm#fn_254.md).

<span id="fn_578"></span>[246:3](sbe1236.htm#fr_582.md) See I, 1, 2, 8.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[246:4](sbe1236.htm#fr_583.md) This seems to refer
to the time when he gets the spoons ready for their sacred use. He then
wipes them with sacrificial grass; that is, he, as it were, rubs down
the horses before starting on his journey to the world of the gods. See
[p. 68](sbe1212.htm#page_68), note [1](sbe1212.htm#fn_208.md).

<span id="fn_580"></span>[247:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_584.md) I adopt the
interpretation of Harisvâmin, who translates avâr*kh*et by adha*h*
patet. The St. Petersb. Dict. apparently proposes, 'he would unharness
them, as he would unharness a horse (or team).' According to Harisvâmin,
the author here controverts the view of the Karakas (*k*araka*s*ruti),
who apparently taught that the (symbolical) unharnessing of the spoons
should succeed their being laid down on the yoke; while our author
maintains that the unharnessing should precede the laying down.
