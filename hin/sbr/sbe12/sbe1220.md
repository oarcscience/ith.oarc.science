### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:1">1:4:4:1</span></span>1. That
same fire, then, they have kindled, (thinking), 'In it, when kindled, we
will sacrifice to the gods.' In it, indeed, he makes these two first
oblations <span id="fr_320"></span>[1](#fn_318) to Mind and Speech (or,
Voice); for mind and speech, when yoked together, convey the sacrifice
to the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:2">1:4:4:2</span></span>2. Now,
what is performed (with formulas, pronounced) in a low voice, by that
the mind conveys the sacrifice to the gods; and what is performed (with
formulas) distinctly uttered by speech, by that the speech conveys the
sacrifice to the gods. And thus takes place here a twofold performance,
whereby

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

he gratifies these two, thinking, 'gratified and pleased, these two
shall convey the sacrifice to the gods.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:3">1:4:4:3</span></span>3. With
the dipping-spoon (sruva, m.) he makes that libation (of clarified
butter) which he makes for the mind; for the mind (manas, n.!) is male,
and male is the sruva.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:4">1:4:4:4</span></span>4. With
the offering-spoon (sru*k*, f.) he makes that libation which he makes
for speech (vâ*k*, f.); for speech is female, and female is the sru*k*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:5">1:4:4:5</span></span>5.
Silently (without a formula) and even without 'svâhâ (hail)!' he makes
that libation which he makes for the mind; for undefined (or indistinct)
is the mind, and undefined is what takes place silently.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:6">1:4:4:6</span></span>6. With a
mantra he makes that libation which he makes for speech; for distinct is
speech, and distinct is the formula.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:7">1:4:4:7</span></span>7.
Sitting he makes that libation which he makes for the mind, and standing
that which he makes for speech. Mind and speech, when yoked together,
assuredly convey the sacrifice to the gods. But when one of two
yoke-fellows is smaller (than the other) they give him a
shoulder-piece <span id="fr_321"></span>[1](#fn_319). Now speech is
indeed smaller than mind; for mind is by far the more unlimited, and
speech is by far the more limited (of the two); hence he thereby (by
standing) gives a shoulder-piece to speech, and as well-matched
yoke-fellows these two now convey the sacrifice to the gods: for speech,
therefore, he sprinkles while standing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:8">1:4:4:8</span></span>8. Now
the gods, when they were performing sacrifice, were afraid of a
disturbance on the part

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

of the Asuras and Rakshas. They, therefore, stood up erect against them
on the south side (of the sacrificial ground); for strength is, as it
were, erect; hence he makes the (second) libation while standing to the
south (of the fire). When he makes a libation on each side (of the fire,
north and south), this (pair), mind and speech, though indeed joined
together, become separate: for one of the two libations is the head of
the sacrifice and the other is its root.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:9">1:4:4:9</span></span>9. With
the dipping-spoon (sruva) he makes that libation which is the root of
the sacrifice, and with the offering-spoon (sru*k*) that which is the
head of the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:10">1:4:4:10</span></span>10.
Silently he makes that libation which is the root of the sacrifice; for
silent, as it were, is this root (of trees &c.), and in it the voice
does not sound.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:11">1:4:4:11</span></span>11.
With a formula he makes that libation which is the head of the
sacrifice; for the formula is speech, and from the head this speech
sounds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:12">1:4:4:12</span></span>12.
Sitting he makes that libation which is the root of the sacrifice; for
seated, as it were, is this root. Standing he makes that libation which
is the head of the sacrifice; for this head stands, as it were.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:13">1:4:4:13</span></span>13.
When he has made the first libation with the dipping-spoon, he says,
'Agnîdh, sweep (touch over) the fire <span
id="fr_322"></span>[1](#fn_320)!' In like manner as one would lay the
yoke on (the shoulders of the team), so also he makes that first
libation; for after laying on the yoke they fasten (the team to it).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:14">1:4:4:14</span></span>14. He
(the Âgnîdhra) then sweeps (the fire with

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

the band of the fire-wood): he thereby harnesses it, thinking, 'Now that
it has been harnessed, may it convey the sacrifice to the gods!' for
this reason he sweeps it. While sweeping it he moves around, since in
harnessing they move around the team. He sweeps thrice each time (i.e.
thrice along each of the three enclosing-sticks): threefold is the
sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:4:15">1:4:4:15</span></span>15. He
sweeps (once), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 7 a), 'O Agni, food-gainer!
I cleanse thee, the food-gainer, who art about to hasten to the food!'
Whereby he says, 'I cleanse thee who art going to convey the sacrifice
(to the gods), thee fit for the sacrifice!' He then sweeps thrice over
(the fire) silently: for just as, after harnessing (the animal), one
urges it on, saying, 'Go on! pull!' so does he thereby strike it with
the lash <span id="fr_323"></span>[1](sbe1221.htm#fn_321), thinking, 'Go
on and convey the sacrifice to the gods!' That is why he (sweeps) thrice
over it silently; and in like manner as this act is performed between
(the two sprinklings of butter), so this mind and speech, though forming
one, thereby become, as it were, separate.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_318"></span>[124:1](sbe1220.htm#fr_320) Viz. the two
âghâras, or pourings (libations) of butter. The first libation, which
belongs to Pra*g*âpati, is made by the Adhvaryu, while seated north of
the fire, immediately after the commencement of the pravara, in a
continuous line from west to east, on the north part of the fire. The
second libation (cf. note on I, 4, 5, 3) is made by the Adhvaryu while
standing on the south side, in the same way on the southern part of the
fire. According to some authorities of the Black Ya*g*us ritual (quoted
by Hillebrandt, Neu and Vollm. pp. 80, 86) the sacrificer pronounces the
anumantra*n*as, 'For Pra*g*âpati is this, not for me: thou art the mind
of Pra*g*âpati!' and 'India's voice (speech) art thou: enter into me
with the voice, with Indra's power!' over the two libations
respectively.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[125:1](sbe1220.htm#fr_321) Upavaha (m.;
upavahas, n., Kâ*n*va rec.), explained by Sâya*n*a as a piece of wood
inserted under the yoke (and on the neck of an ox) in order to make it
level with the height of the yoke-fellow.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[126:1](sbe1220.htm#fr_322) See I, 4, 2, 12,
with note.
