### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:1">2:1:2:1</span></span>1. He may
set up the two fires <span id="fr_652"></span>[1](#fn_648.md) under the
K*ri*ttikâs; for they, the K*ri*ttikâs, are doubtless Agni's asterism,
so that if he sets up his fires under Agni's asterism, (he will bring
about) a correspondence (between his fires and the asterism): for this
reason he may set up his fires under the K*ri*ttikâs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:2">2:1:2:2</span></span>2.
Moreover, the other lunar asterisms (consist of) one, two, three or four
(stars), so that the K*ri*ttikâs are the most numerous (of
asterisms) <span id="fr_653"></span>[2](#fn_649.md): hence he thereby
obtains an abundance. For this reason he may set up his fires under the
K*ri*ttikâs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:3">2:1:2:3</span></span>3. And
again, they do not move away from the eastern quarter, whilst the other
asterisms do move from the eastern quarter. Thus his (two fires) are
established in the eastern quarter: for this reason he may set up his
fires under the K*ri*ttikâs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:4">2:1:2:4</span></span>4. On the
other hand (it is argued) why he should not set up the fires under the
K*ri*ttikâs. Originally, namely, the latter were the wives of the Bears
(*ri*ksha); for the seven *Ri*shis <span id="fr_654"></span>[3](#fn_650.md)
were in former times

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

called the *Ri*kshas (bears). They were, however, precluded from
intercourse (with their husbands), for the latter, the seven *Ri*shis,
rise in the north, and they (the K*ri*ttikâs) in the east. Now it is a
misfortune for one to be precluded from intercourse (with his wife): he
should therefore not set up his fires under the K*ri*ttikâs, lest he
should thereby be precluded from intercourse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:5">2:1:2:5</span></span>5. But he
may nevertheless set up (his fire under the K*ri*ttikâs); for Agni
doubtless is their mate, and it is with Agni that they have intercourse:
for this reason he may set up (the fire under the K*ri*ttikâs).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:6">2:1:2:6</span></span>6. He may
also set up his fires under (the asterism of Rohi*n*î. For under
Rohi*n*î it was that Pra*g*âpati, when desirous of progeny (or
creatures), set up his fires. He created beings, and the creatures
produced by him remained invariable and constant <span
id="fr_655"></span>[1](#fn_651), like (red) cows (rohi*n*î.md): hence the
cow-like nature of Rohi*n*î. Rich in cattle and offspring therefore he
becomes whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fires under Rohi*n*î.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:7">2:1:2:7</span></span>7. Under
Rohi*n*î, indeed, the cattle set up their fires, thinking that they
might attain to (ruh) the desire (or love) of men. They did attain to
the

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

desire of men; and whatever desire the cattle then obtained in regard to
men, that same desire he obtains, in regard to cattle, whosoever,
knowing this, sets up his fire under Rohi*n*î.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:8">2:1:2:8</span></span>8. He may
also set up his fires under (the asterism of) M*ri*ga*s*îrsha. For
M*ri*ga*s*îrsha, indeed, is the head of Pra*g*âpati <span
id="fr_656"></span>[1](#fn_652); and the head (*s*iras.md) means excellence
(*s*rî), for the head does indeed mean excellence: hence they say of him
who is the most excellent (*s*resh*th*a) of a community, that he is the
head of that community. Excellence therefore he attains whosoever,
knowing this, sets up his fire under M*ri*ga*s*îrsha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:9">2:1:2:9</span></span>9. On the
other hand (it is argued) why one should not set up his fire under
M*ri*ga*s*îrsha <span id="fr_657"></span>[2](#fn_653.md). The latter,
indeed, is Pra*g*âpati's body. Now, when they (the gods) on that
occasion pierced him <span id="fr_658"></span>[3](#fn_654.md) with what is
called 'the three-knotted arrow,' he abandoned that

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

body, for the body is a mere relic (or dwelling, vâstu), unholy and
sapless. He should therefore not set up his fires under M*ri*ga*s*îrsha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:10">2:1:2:10</span></span>10. But
he may, nevertheless, set them up (under M*ri*ga*s*îrsha). For,
assuredly, the body of that god, Pra*g*âpati, is neither a relic nor
unholy, <span id="fr_659"></span>[1](#fn_655.md): he may therefore set up
(his fires under M*ri*ga*s*îrsha). 'Under the Punarvasû he should
perform the Punarâdheya <span id="fr_660"></span>[2](#fn_656.md),' thus (it
is prescribed).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:11">2:1:2:11</span></span>11. He
may also set up his fires under the Phalgunîs. They, the Phalgunîs, are
Indra's asterism <span id="fr_661"></span>[3](#fn_657.md), and even
correspond to him in name; for indeed Indra is also called Ar*g*una,
this being his mystic name; and they (the Phalgunîs) are also called
Ar*g*unîs. Hence he overtly calls them Phalgunîs, for who dares to use
his (the god's) mystic name? Moreover, the sacrificer himself is Indra,
so that he in that case sets up his fires under his own asterism. Indra
is the deity of the sacrifice; and accordingly his Agnyâdheya is thereby
brought

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

into relation with Indra. He may set up the fires under the first
(Pûrva-phalgunîs)--whereby an advancing (successful) sacrifice accrues
to him; or he may set them up under the second
(Uttara-phalgunîs)--whereby a progressive (uttarâvat) improvement
accrues to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:12">2:1:2:12</span></span>12. Let
him set up his fires under the asterism Hasta <span
id="fr_662"></span>[1](#fn_658), whosoever should wish that (presents.md)
should be offered him: then indeed (that will take place) forthwith; for
whatever is offered with the hand (hasta), that indeed is given to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:13">2:1:2:13</span></span>13. He
may also set up his fires under *K*itrâ. Now the gods and the Asuras,
both of them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, were contending for superiority.
Both parties were desirous of rising to yonder world, the sky. The
Asuras then constructed the fire (altar) called rauhi*n*a (fit to ascend
by), thinking, 'Thereby we shall ascend (â-ruh) to the sky <span
id="fr_663"></span>[2](#fn_659.md).'

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:14">2:1:2:14</span></span>14.
Indra then considered <span id="fr_664"></span>[1](#fn_660.md), 'If they
construct that (fire-altar), they will certainly prevail over us.' He
secured a brick and proceeded thither, passing himself off for a
Brâhman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:15">2:1:2:15</span></span>15.
'Hark ye!' he said, 'I, too, will put on this (brick) for myself!' 'Very
well,' they replied. He put it on. That fire (altar) of theirs wanted
but very little to be completely built up,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:16">2:1:2:16</span></span>16.
When he said, 'I shall take back this (brick) which belongs to me.' He
took hold of it and pulled it out; and on its being pulled out, the
fire-altar fell down; and along with the falling fire-altar the Asuras
fell down. He then converted those bricks into thunderbolts and clove
the (Asuras') necks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:17">2:1:2:17</span></span>17.
Thereupon the gods assembled and said, 'Wonderfully (*k*itram) indeed it
has fared with us who have slain so many enemies!' Hence the wonderful
nature (*k*itrâtva) <span id="fr_665"></span>[2](#fn_661.md) of the
asterism

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *K*itrâ; and
verily wonderfully it fares with him, and he slays his rivals, his
spiteful enemy, whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fires under
*K*itrâ. A Kshatriya, therefore, should especially desire to take
advantage of this asterism; since such a one is anxious to strike, to
vanquish his enemies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:18">2:1:2:18</span></span>18.
Originally these (nakshatras) were so many different powers (kshatra),
just as that sun yonder. But as soon as he rose, he took from them
(â-dâ) their energy, their power; therefore he (the sun) is called
Âditya, because he took from them their energy, their power <span
id="fr_666"></span>[1](#fn_662.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:2:19">2:1:2:19</span></span>19. The
gods then said, 'They who have been powers, shall no longer (na) be
powers (kshatra) <span id="fr_667"></span>[2](#fn_663.md)!' Hence the
powerlessness (na-kshatratvam) of the nakshatras. For this reason also
one need only take the sun for one's nakshatra (star), since he took
away from them their energy, their power. But if he (the sacrificer)
should nevertheless be desirous of having a nakshatra (under which to
set up his fires), then assuredly that sun is a faultless nakshatra for
him; and through that auspicious day (marked by the rising and setting
of the sun) he should endeavour to obtain the benefits of whichever of
those asterisms he might desire. Let him therefore take the sun alone
for his nakshatra <span id="fr_668"></span>[3](#fn_664.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_648"></span>[282:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_652.md) That is, the
Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya, the two principal fires.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[282:2](sbe1241.htm#fr_653.md) Whilst the
K*ri*ttikâs, or Pleiades, are supposed to consist of seven (or,
according to others, of six) stars. the remaining twenty-six nakshatras
or lunar mansions, according to our author, vary between one and four
stars. Hence the K*ri*ttikâs are also called Bahulâs, 'the numerous.' In
the later accounts, however, a larger number of stars is attributed to
several nakshatras. Cf. Weber, Nakshatra, II, pp. 368, 381. The Kâ*n*va
text has: 'Other nakshatras are (i.e. consist of) four; and there is
here an abundance, so that he thereby obtains abundance.'

<span id="fn_650"></span>[282:3](sbe1241.htm#fr_654.md) Saptarshi, or the
seven *Ri*shis, is the designation of the <span id="page_283">p.
283</span> constellation of Ursa Major, or the Wain. In the Rig-vela,.
rikshâ*h* (bears) occurs once (I, 24, 10), either in the same restricted
sense, or in that of stars generally.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[283:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_655.md) 'Tâ asya pra*g*â*h*
s*ri*sh*t*â ekarûpâ upastabdhâs tasthû rohi*n*ya iva.' The Kâ*n*va text
reads: Tam imâ*h* pra*g*â*h* s*ri*sh*t*â rohi*n*ya ivopastabdhâs tasthur
ekarâpâ iva. Sâya*n*a interprets upastabdhâ*h* ('propped up, erect,'
established) by 'pratibaddha*g*âtaya*h* (of continuous lineage),' and
ekarûpâ*h* ('uniform') by 'avi*kkh*innapravâhâ*h* (of uninterrupted flow
or succession).' In Taitt. Br. I, 1, 2, 2, it is stated that Pra*g*âpati
created Agni under (the asterism) Rohi*n*î, and that the gods then set
up that fire under the same asterism.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[284:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_656.md) For the mythical
allusions in this and the succeeding paragraphs, we have to compare
*S*at. Br. I, 7, 4, 1; Ait. Br. III, 33. According to the version of the
myth given in the latter work, Pra*g*âpati transformed himself into a
roe-buck (*ris*ya) and approached his own daughter (either the sky, or
the dawn), who had assumed the shape of a doe (rohit). Out of their most
fearful forms the gods then fashioned a divine being called Bhûtavat
(i.e. Rudra), in order to punish Pra*g*âpati for his incestuous deed.
The latter was accordingly pierced by Bhûtavat's arrow and bounded up to
the sky, where he became the constellation called M*ri*ga (i.e.
M*ri*ga*s*îrsha), while his daughter became the asterism Rohi*n*î. The
arrow on the other hand, with which Pra*g*âpati was pierced, became the
constellation called 'the three-knotted arrow (perhaps the girdle of
Orion).'

<span id="fn_653"></span>[284:2](sbe1241.htm#fr_657.md) The Black Ya*g*us
does not recommend this asterism for the performance of agnyâdheya.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[284:3](sbe1241.htm#fr_658.md) The Kâ*n*va text
reads, 'When, on that occasion, that god (viz. Rudra) pierced him with
the three-knotted arrow.'

<span id="fn_655"></span>[285:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_659.md) Na vâ etasya
devasya vâstu nâya*gñ*iya*m* na *s*arîram asti.--Na vai tasya vâstu na
nivîrya*m* nâya*gñ*iyam asti, 'for the relic of that (god) is neither
sapless nor impure.' Kâ*n*va recension.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[285:2](sbe1241.htm#fr_660.md) I.e. the repetition
of the âdheya, or setting up of his fires, a ceremony which has to be
performed in the event of the âdheya having proved unsuccessful; that
is, in case he should not have prospered or even sustained losses. The
direction has been inserted in this place on account of the position of
Punarvasû, as the fifth mansion, between M*ri*ga*s*îrsha, the third, and
(Pûrva and Uttara) Phalgunîs, the ninth and tenth mansions, in the
original order of the nakshatras.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[285:3](sbe1241.htm#fr_661.md) In Taitt. Br. I, 1,
2, 4, the Pûrve Phalgunî are assigned to Aryaman, and the Uttare
Phalgunî to Bhaga. While, however, both these asterisms are there
recommended for the agnyâdheya, the Pûrve Phalgunî are rejected as
unsuitable further on, in par. 8 (? a later addition).

<span id="fn_658"></span>[286:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_662.md) In the Taitt. Br.
this asterism is not mentioned as suitable for the agnyâdheya. The
Â*s*v. *S*. II, 1, to omits both Hasta and *K*itrâ; but permits the
asterisms Vi*s*âkhe and Uttare Prosh*th*apade.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[286:2](sbe1241.htm#fr_663.md) In Taitt. Br. I, 1,
2, 4-6 this myth is related as follows: 'There were Asuras, named
Kâlaka*ñg*as. They constructed a fire (altar) with a view to (gaining)
the world of heaven. They put, every man of them, a brick to it. Indra,
passing himself off for a Brâhman, put a brick on for himself, saying,
"This one, *K*îtra (the wonderful or bright one) by name, is for me!"
They climbed up to heaven; Indra, however, pulled out his brick, and
they tumbled down. And they who tumbled down, became spiders: two of
them flew up, and they became the two heavenly dogs.' On this myth, Dr.
A. Kuhn, 'Über entwickelungsstufen der mythenbildung,' p. 129, remarks:
'The myth given in Homer's Od. xi, 305-325, of Otos and Ephialtes, who,
in order to fight the immortal gods, piled Ossa on Olympos, and Pelion
on Ossa, of ἵν᾽ οὐρανὸς, and who are destroyed by Apollon, shows an
obvious resemblance to these Indian myths; the more so, if we divest the
latter of their Brâhmanical form, by which altar-bricks are substituted
<span id="page_287">p. 287</span> for mountains; and if we hear in mind
that the later versions of the myth, e.g. in the well-known passage of
Ovid, put the Gigantes in the place of the Aloades.' See also Weber,
Nakshatra, II, p. 372.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[287:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_664.md) The Kâ*n*va text
here proceeds thus: The gods then were afraid and said, 'If those
(Asuras) complete (samâsyanti) that (fire-altar), they will prevail over
us.' Then Indra having fastened a brick with the lightning-band
(ârke*n*a dâmnâ) went thither passing himself off for a Brâhman. He
said, 'I, too, will put on this (brick) for myself.' They said, 'On then
(upa hi)!' He put it on. That (fire-altar) wanted but very little to be
built up, when he said, 'I shall take this (brick) which is mine,' Take
it then (â hi)!' they said. Then seizing it (tâm abhihâya) he pulled it
out. On its being pulled out the fire-altar tumbled down. On the
fire-altar having tumbled down he made thunderbolts with those bricks
and smote those (Asuras). Then the gods prevailed and the Asuras were
worsted, &c.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[287:2](sbe1241.htm#fr_665.md) Or, perhaps, its
identity with (Indra's brick) *K*itrâ; cf. preceding note.

<span id="fn_662"></span>[288:1](sbe1241.htm#fr_666.md) The Kâ*n*va text
reads: Tâni ha vâ etâni kshatrâ*n*i nânaiva tepur yathâsau vâ sûrya*s*
*k*andramâ vâ; teshâ*m* hodyann evâditya*h* kshatra*m* vîrya*m* tega*h*
pralulopa, tad vaishâm âdade.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[288:2](sbe1241.htm#fr_667.md) This etymology of
nakshatra is of course quite fanciful. For Aufrecht's probably correct
derivation of the word from nakta-tra, 'night-protector,' cf.
Zeitschrift für vergl. Sprachf., VIII, pp. 71, 72. See also Weber,
Nakshatra; II, p. 268.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[288:3](sbe1241.htm#fr_668.md) The Kâ*n*va text
reads: Tasmân na nakshatram âdriyeta yadaivaisha kadâ *k*odîyâd apy
âdadhîtaisha hi sarvâ*n*i kshatrâ*n*i <span id="page_289">p. 289</span>
yadyu nakshatrakâma*h* syâd upo âsîta nakshatram ahâsya bhavati no
etasyânudayo ’sti tasmâd v apy upaina(m â)sîta, 'he need therefore not
attend to any nakshatra; but may set up his fires at any time when that
(sun) rises, for he (the sun) is all the kshatras. Should he
nevertheless be desirous of a nakshatra, let him approach (the sun) with
veneration; for then there is a nakshatra for him, and that (sun) does
not fail to rise: for this reason let him approach (the sun) with
veneration.'
