### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:1">1:6:3:1</span></span>1.
Tvash*tri* had a three-headed, six-eyed son. He had three mouths; and
because he was thus shaped, his name was Vi*s*varûpa ('All-shape').

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:2">1:6:3:2</span></span>2. One of
his mouths was Soma-drinking, one spirit-drinking, and one for other
kinds of food. Indra hated him and cut off those heads of his.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:3">1:6:3:3</span></span>3. Now
from the one which was Soma-drinking, a hazel-cock (francoline
partridge) sprang forth; whence the latter is of brownish colour, for
king Soma is brown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:4">1:6:3:4</span></span>4. From
the one which was spirit-drinking, further, a sparrow sprang; whence the
latter talks as if stammering, for he who has drunk spirits, talks as if
he stammered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:5">1:6:3:5</span></span>5. Then
from the one which served for other kinds of food, a partridge sprang;
whence the latter

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

is much variegated in colour: on its wings, namely, butter-drops, as it
were, have dropped in one place and honey- (or mead-) drops in another,
for suchlike, as it were, was the food which he consumed with that
(mouth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:6">1:6:3:6</span></span>6.
Tvash*tri* was furious: 'Has he indeed slain my son?' he exclaimed. He
brought Soma-juice from which Indra was excluded; and just as the
Soma-juice on being produced had Indra excluded from it (apendra), so it
remained (when it was offered up).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:7">1:6:3:7</span></span>7. Indra
thought with himself, 'They are now excluding me from Soma!' and though
uninvited, he consumed what pure (Soma) there was in the tub, even as
the stronger (consumes) that of a weaker. That (Soma) however, injured
him; it flowed in all directions from (the openings of) his vital airs;
from his mouth alone it did not flow, but from all the other (openings
of the) vital airs it flowed; hence (was instituted) at that time the
ish*t*i, called Sautrâma*n*î: on the occasion of that (ceremony) it is
explained how the gods healed him <span id="fr_386"></span>[1](#fn_383.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:8">1:6:3:8</span></span>8.
Tvash*tri* was furious, and exclaimed, 'Has he indeed consumed my Soma
uninvited?' However, he himself desecrated the sacrifice, for what pure
(Soma) there was left in the tub he let flow (into the fire), saying,
'Grow thou, having Indra for thy foe <span
id="fr_387"></span>[2](#fn_384.md)!' The moment it reached the fire, it

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

developed (into human shape), or, as some say, it so developed whilst on
its way (to the fire). It became possessed of <span
id="fr_388"></span>[1](#fn_385.md) Agni and Soma, of all sciences, all
glory, all nourishment, all prosperity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:9">1:6:3:9</span></span>9. And
since it so developed whilst rolling onwards (v*ri*t), it became
V*ri*tra; and since he sprang forth footless, therefore he was a
serpent. Danu and Danâyû received him like mother and father <span
id="fr_389"></span>[2](#fn_386.md), whence they call him Dânava.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:10">1:6:3:10</span></span>10. And
because he (Tvash*tri*) said, 'Grow thou, having Indra for thy foe!'
therefore Indra slew him (V*ri*tra). Had he said, 'Grow thou, the foe
(slayer) of Indra!' he (V*ri*tra) would certainly have forthwith slain
Indra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:11">1:6:3:11</span></span>11. And
because he (Tvash*tri*) said, 'Grow thou!' therefore he (V*ri*tra) grew
an arrow's range sideways and an arrow's range forward: he forced back
both the western ocean and the eastern one; and in proportion as he
extended did he devour the food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:12">1:6:3:12</span></span>12. In
the fore-noon the gods offered him food, at mid-day the men, and in the
after-noon the Fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:13">1:6:3:13</span></span>13. Now
while Indra was thus moving on (in pursuit of V*ri*tra), he addressed
Agni and Soma, 'Ye belong to me and I belong to you! That one is nothing
to you: why then do ye support that Dasyu against me? Come over to me!'

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:14">1:6:3:14</span></span>14.
They replied, 'What is to be our reward in that case?' He offered them
that Agni-Soma cake on eleven potsherds: this is the reason why there is
a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:15">1:6:3:15</span></span>15.
They went over to him, and after them went forth <span
id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_387.md) all the gods, all the sciences, all
glory, all nourishment, all prosperity: thus by offering that (cake to
Agni and Soma) Indra became what Indra now is. Such then is the
significance of the full-moon offering; and he who, knowing this,
performs the full-moon offering in this wise, attains to the same state
of prosperity, becomes thus endowed with glory, becomes such a consumer
of food (as V*ri*tra).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:16">1:6:3:16</span></span>16. Now
V*ri*tra, on being struck, lay contracted like a leather bottle drained
of its contents, like a skin bag with the barley-meal shaken out. Indra
rushed at him, meaning to slay him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:17">1:6:3:17</span></span>17. He
said, 'Do not hurl (thy thunderbolt) at me! thou art now what I (was
before) Only cut me in twain; but do not let me be annihilated!' He
(Indra) said, 'Thou shalt be my food!' He replied, 'So be it!' He
accordingly cut him in twain; and from that (part) of his which was of
the Soma nature <span id="fr_391"></span>[2](#fn_388.md), he made the moon,
and that which was demoniacal (asurya) he made enter these creatures as
their belly; hence people say <span id="fr_392"></span>[3](#fn_389.md):
'V*ri*tra was then a consumer of food, and V*ri*tra is so now.' For even
now, whenever that one (the moon) waxes fuller, it fills itself out of
this world <span id="fr_393"></span>[4](#fn_390.md); and whenever

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

these creatures crave for food, they pay tribute to this V*ri*tra, the
belly. Whosoever knows that V*ri*tra as a consumer of food, becomes
himself a consumer of food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:18">1:6:3:18</span></span>18.
Those deities then said, 'Ye, Agni and Soma, whom we have followed
hither, take the best part (of the sacrificial food): do let us share
along with you in what ye have!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:19">1:6:3:19</span></span>19.
They both said, 'What (share) shall then be ours?' They replied, 'For
whatever deity they shall take out sacrificial food, they shall in the
first place offer to you some clarified butter!' Whenever, therefore,
they take out sacrificial food for any deity, they in the first place
offer two butter-portions to Agni and Soma. This does not take place at
the Soma-sacrifice, nor at the animal offering; for they said, 'for
whatever deity they take out . . .  <span
id="fr_394"></span>[1](#fn_391.md).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:20">1:6:3:20</span></span>20.
Agni then said, 'In me they shall sacrifice for all of you, and thus I
give you a share in me!' For this reason they sacrifice in Agni (the
fire) to all the gods; and for this reason they say that Agni is all the
deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:21">1:6:3:21</span></span>21.
Soma then said, 'Me they shall offer up to all of you, and thus I give
you a share in me!' For this reason they offer up Soma to all the gods;
and hence they say that Soma is all the deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:22">1:6:3:22</span></span>22. And
further, since all the gods were abiding in Indra, for that reason they
say that Indra is all the deities, that the gods have Indra for their
chief (*s*resh*th*a). Thus the gods came in a three-fold

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

way to consist of one deity; and he who knows this becomes individually
the chief of his own (people).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:23">1:6:3:23</span></span>23.
Twofold, verily, is this, there is no third: to wit, the moist and the
dry; and what is dry, that relates to Agni; and what is moist, that
relates to Soma. But (it may be objected) if this is twofold only, why
then this manifold performance:--the two butter-portions for Agni and
Soma, the low-voiced offering to Agni and Soma, and the rice-cake for
Agni and Soma,--when by means of any one of these he obtains all, why
then this manifold performance? \[The answer to this objection is that\]
so manifold is the power, the generative force of Agni and Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:24">1:6:3:24</span></span>24. The
sun, indeed, relates to Agni, and the moon to Soma; the day relates to
Agni, and the night to Soma; the waxing half-moon relates to Agni, and
the waning one to Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:25">1:6:3:25</span></span>25. 'By
means of the two butter-portions he obtains the sun and the moon; by
means of the low-voiced offering he obtains the day and the night; and
by means of the rice-cake he obtains the two half-moons,' thus say some.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:26">1:6:3:26</span></span>26.
Âsuri, on the other hand, said: 'By means of the two butter-portions he
gains any two (of those objects <span id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_392).md);
by means of the low-voiced offering he obtains any (other) two; and by
means of the rice-cake he obtains any (other) two: "all has been
obtained, all has been conquered by me! with that All I will slay
V*ri*tra; with the All I will slay the

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

spiteful enemy!" thus he thinks, and for that reason there is this
manifold performance.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:27">1:6:3:27</span></span>27. On
this point it has also been remarked: 'Why this sameness (of
performance)? By what is introduced between the butter(-offering) to
Agni and Soma and the rice-cake to Agni and Soma, a repetition of
performance (is committed) <span id="fr_396"></span>[1](#fn_393.md).'
Sameness (of performance), nevertheless, is avoided in this way: the one
(viz. the low-voiced offering) consists of butter, and the other of a
rice-cake, hence the one is different from the other. Moreover, after
reciting a *Ri*k-verse as anuvâkyâ, he pronounces the yâ*g*yâ with the
word 'pleased' (in the case of the butter-portions to Agni and Soma);
and after reciting a *Ri*k-verse as anuvâkyâ, he pronounces the yâ*g*yâ
in the form of a *Ri*k-verse (in the case of the low-voiced offering to
Agni and Soma), hence the one is (again) different from the other <span
id="fr_397"></span>[2](#fn_394.md). Sameness of performance is also avoided
in this way: in a low voice (he utters the formulas when) he offers of
the butter, and with a loud voice of the cake; and what is (uttered) in
a low voice, that is the manner of Pra*g*âpati: hence he recites for
that (low-voiced

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

offering) an anush*t*ubh-verse as the invitatory formula (anuvâkyâ), for
the anush*t*ubh represents speech, and Pra*g*âpati also is speech.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:28">1:6:3:28</span></span>28. By
means of that low-voiced offering the gods stealing near slew, with that
thunderbolt, the vasha*t*-call, whichever they wished of the Asuras; and
so does this one, after stealing near by means of that low-voiced
offering, slay with that thunderbolt, the vasha*t*-call, the wicked,
spiteful enemy <span id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_395.md). This is why he
performs the low-voiced offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:29">1:6:3:29</span></span>29.
Having recited (at the butter-portions) a *Ri*k-verse as the anuvâkyâ,
he recites the yâ*g*yâ with the word 'pleased:' in consequence of this,
creatures are brought forth here with teeth on one side (in one jaw);
for the *Ri*k means bone and the tooth also is bone, so that he thereby
produces bone on one side.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:30">1:6:3:30</span></span>30.
Having recited (at the low-voiced offering) a *Ri*k-verse as the
anuvâkyâ, he recites as the yâ*g*yâ a (second) *Ri*k-verse: in
consequence of this, creatures with teeth on both sides are brought
forth here; for the *Ri*k means bone and the tooth also is bone, so that
he thereby produces bone on both sides. These creatures, indeed, are of
two kinds, viz. such as have teeth on one side only, and such as have
teeth on both sides <span id="fr_399"></span>[2](#fn_396.md); and verily he
who sacrifices, knowing

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

thus the generative power of Agni and Soma, becomes rich in offspring
and cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:31">1:6:3:31</span></span>31.
When he (the sacrificer) is about to enter upon the fast of the
full-moon ceremony, he may not be entirely sated. He therefore now
compresses (that part of) his belly which relates to the Asuras; and
next morning, by means of the oblations, that which relates to the gods.
Now the practice regarding the full-moon ceremony is as follows:

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:32">1:6:3:32</span></span>32. One
may (enter on the) fast at the very time (of full moon), thinking, 'Now
I will slay V*ri*tra, now I will slay the spiteful enemy!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:33">1:6:3:33</span></span>33. One
may also fast only on the following day. Now he who (enters on the) fast
at the very time (of full moon), gets, as it were, into collision <span
id="fr_400"></span>[1](#fn_397) (with some one.md); and when two come into
collision with one another, it is indeed doubtful which of the two will
get the better of the other. He, on the other hand, who prefers to fast
on the second day (only), is as one who crushes from behind a retreating
(enemy) before he is able to resist the attack: striking in one
direction <span id="fr_401"></span>[2](#fn_398.md), in fact, is he who thus
keeps the fast on the second day only.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:34">1:6:3:34</span></span>34. Let
him therefore enter on the fast at the very time (of full moon). He who
keeps the fast on the following day only is as one who finally crushes
one struck down by some one else; he only does what has been done before
by some one else, he only

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

follows another's lead; let him therefore enter on the fast at the very
time (of full moon).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:35">1:6:3:35</span></span>35.
After Pra*g*âpati had created the living beings, his joints (parvan)
were relaxed. Now Pra*g*âpati, doubtless, is the year, and his joints
are the two junctions of day and night (i.e. the, twilights), the full
moon and new moon, and the beginnings of the seasons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:36">1:6:3:36</span></span>36. He
was unable to rise with his relaxed joints; and the gods healed him by
means of these havis-offerings: by means of the Agnihotra they healed
that joint (which consists of) the two junctions of day and night,
joined that together; by means of the full-moon and the new-moon
sacrifice they healed that joint (which consists of) the full and new
moon, joined that together; and by means of the (three) *K*âturmâsyas
(seasonal offerings) they healed that joint (which consists of) the
beginnings of the seasons, joined that together.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:37">1:6:3:37</span></span>37.
With his joints thus repaired he betook himself to this food,--to the
food which is here (offered) to Pra*g*âpati; and he who, knowing this,
enters upon the fast at the very time (of full moon), heals
Pra*g*âpati's joint at the proper time, and Pra*g*âpati favours him.
Thus he who, knowing this, enters upon the fast at the very time (of
full moon) becomes a consumer of food: let him therefore enter on the
fast at the very time (of full moon).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:38">1:6:3:38</span></span>38.
These two butter-portions (to Agni and Soma), truly, are the eyes of the
sacrifice; he, therefore, offers them in front (of, or before, the
havis), for these eyes are in the front (of the head). Hence he thereby
places the eyes in the front; and for this reason these eyes are in the
front (of the head).

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:39">1:6:3:39</span></span>39.
Some people offer Agni's butter-portion in the north-eastern part (of
the fire), and Soma's butter-portion in the south-eastern part,
thinking, 'Thereby we place the eyes in the front (of the head).' This,
however, is rather unintelligible; for the several dishes of sacrificial
food (havis) represent the body of the sacrifice; when therefore he
offers in front of (or before) the havis, he thereby places the eyes in
the front. Let him rather make the offerings (in that part of the fire)
where he thinks the fiercest blaze is; for only by being offered in
blazing (fire) are oblations successful <span
id="fr_402"></span>[1](#fn_399.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:40">1:6:3:40</span></span>40.
Having recited (at the butter-portions) a *Ri*k-verse as anuvâkyâ
(invitatory formula), he recites by way of yâ*g*yâ (offering-prayer) the
(formula containing the word) 'pleased;' thereby these boneless eyes are
set in what is bone. If, on the other hand, after reciting a *Ri*k-verse
as anuvâkyâ, he

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

were to use a *Ri*k-verse as the yâ*g*yâ, he would make it bone instead
of eye.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:3:41">1:6:3:41</span></span>41.
Those two (qualities), truly, are related to the natures of Agni and
Soma: that which is white is related to Agni, and that which is black is
related to Soma. If, however (it were asserted), on the contrary, that
what is black is related to Agni, and what is white is related to
Soma,--\[the answer would be:--\] what sees is of the nature of Agni,
for dry, as it were, are the eyes of one who looks, and that which is
dry relates to Agni;--and what sleeps is of the nature of Soma, for
moist, as it were, are the eyes of one who is asleep, and moist also is
Soma. And, verily, he who thus knows those two butter-portions to be
eyes, remains endowed with eye-sight till old age in this world, and
starts in yonder world possessed of eye-sight.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[164:1](sbe1227.htm#fr_383.md) See I, 3, 5, 10.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[164:2](sbe1227.htm#fr_384.md) For these verses,
the first of which begins 'Agni is the head of the sky,' see Vâ*g*. S.
XIII, 14 and 15.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[164:3](sbe1227.htm#fr_385.md) That is, the
yâ*g*yâ (offering-prayer) and puro’nuvâkyâ (invitatory prayer) at the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t, or oblation to Agni, as the maker of good offering, at
the end of the chief oblations. The two virâ*g* formulas are Rig-veda
VII, 1, 3 (Vâ*g*. XVII, 76; Taitt. S. IV 5, 4) preddho agne dîdihi, and
Rig-veda VII, 1, 18 (Taitt. S. IV, 3, 13, 6) imo agne. Cf. Ait. Br. I,
5.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[165:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_386.md) See V, 5, 4, 2
seq., where the whole legend is repeated; and Taitt. S. II, 4, 12, 1.
One of the objects of the Sautrâma*n*î is the expiation of an immoderate
consumption of Soma by a priest.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[165:2](sbe1228.htm#fr_387.md) According to Taitt.
S. II, 4, 12, 1, also the fault committed by Tvash*tri* consisted in his
faulty accentuation of the compound indra*s*atru in the formula. What he
intended to say was that Agni, on drinking the Soma, should grow strong
so as to be 'the foe (slayer) of Indra,' and the compound should
therefore have been accented on the second member, viz. indra*s*átru
(the foe of <span id="page_166">p. 166</span> Indra); but by accenting
it on the first member, indra*s*atru, he made it 'having Indra for his
foe (slayer).' According to the version of the Taitt. S., Agni, the
fire, on the Soma being poured into it, rose up (spirted) as if to
execute Tvash*tri*'s wish; but immediately relapsed into its former
state of inertness on hearing the mis-pronounced word.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[166:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_388.md) Abhisambabhûva, 'he
grew by consuming,' &c. Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[166:2](sbe1228.htm#fr_389.md) The Kâ*n*va text
has, 'Danu and Dânavî received him as mother and father.'

<span id="fn_387"></span>[167:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_390.md) Preyuh, 'the gods
&c. that were in V*ri*tra's mouth went out,' Sâya*n*a; see preceding

nyaktam âsa' \['yat saumyo nyaṅga âsa,' Kâ*n*va rec.\], 'what was imbued
with Soma,' 'what had Soma inherent in it.' Cf. 'yat somasya nyaktam
âsa,' I, 7, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[167:3](sbe1228.htm#fr_392.md) 'People say so when
anybody eats much food.' Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[167:4](sbe1228.htm#fr_393.md) See I, 6, 4, 15.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[168:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_394.md) The nirvapanam, or
taking out (literally throwing out) of (handfuls of) havis from the
receptacle and putting it into the winnowing basket (or other vessels),
does not apply to these two kinds of sacrifices. Cf. I, 1, 2, 5 seq.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[169:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_395.md) 'Yatame vâ yatame
vâ dve âpnoti.' Sâya*n*a supplies vastunî, 'objects.' The Kâ*n*va
recension, on the other hand, reads, 'Yatame vâ yatame vâ dve devate
âpnoti.'

<span id="fn_393"></span>[170:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_396.md) See [p.
80](sbe1213.htm#page_80), note [2](sbe1213.htm#fn_240.md). The objection
here raised is, that the low-voiced offering, which is intermediate
between the two above-mentioned oblations to Agni-Soma, is made to the
same two deities.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[170:2](sbe1228.htm#fr_397.md) When the two
butter-portions to Agni and Soma are offered, the Hot*ri* recites the
verses Rig-veda VI, 16, 34 (Vâ*g*. S. 33, 9), and Rig-veda, I, 95, 5
(Vâ*g*. S. 19, 42) respectively, as anuvâkyâs, or invitatory prayers,
each of which is followed by the yâ*g*yâ (offering-formula): 'We who
pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni (or Soma respectively),--may Agni
(Soma) pleased (*g*ushâ*n*a*h*) accept of the butter-oblation!
Vâusha*t*!' At the low-voiced offering (upâ*ms*uyâ*g*a) to Agni-Soma, on
the other hand, he first utters (in a low voice) as anuvâkyâ the verse
Rig-veda I, 93, 2, and thereupon as yâ*g*yâ Rig-veda I, 93, 6.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[171:1](sbe1228.htm#fr_398.md) The two prayers of
the low-voiced offering are muttered in a low voice; but the
'Vâusha*t*!' at the end of the offering-prayer (as the 'Om!' at the end
of the invitatory prayer) is uttered aloud. Hence the above symbolical
explanation.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[171:2](sbe1228.htm#fr_399.md) The same
distinction is made in Rig-veda X, 90, 10, where it is stated that from
the Purusha sprang the horse and what other animals with two rows of
teeth (viz. the ass and mule, according to Sâya*n*a) on the one hand,
and cows, goats, and sheep on the other. In Taitt. II, 2, 6, 3, also the
horse is mentioned along with man as belonging to the former class of
living beings. Cf. also Taitt. V, 1, 2, 6; Ath.-veda V, 19, 2; 31, 3;
Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 58.

literally 'comes together with, meets (somebody).' This symbolical
explanation was probably suggested by the circumstance that the full
moon marks the junction (sandhi) of the two pakshas or half months;
whereas the new moon (amâvâsyâ, 'dwelling together') marks the point of
least distance between sun and moon.

admits either mode of offering the butter-portions. These oblations are
effected in the following way:--The Adhvaryu, having called on the
Hot*ri* to recite the anuvâkyâ, takes with the dipping-spoon (sruva)
butter from the dhruvâ and puts it into the *g*uhû; he then draws some
with the sruva from the butter-pot and replenishes the dhruvâ with it
\[according to the Kâ*n*vas, with the text 'May the dhruvâ fatten with
the havis-butter, sacrifice after sacrifice, for those who go to the
gods,--the udder of Sûryâ in the lap of Aditi: may the earth flow
abundantly at this sacrifice!'\]. The same process is then repeated
three (additional) times (with a *G*amadagni four times): hence the
offering is said to consist of four (or five) cuttings. The Hot*ri* then
recites the anuvâkyâ (see note on I, 6, 3, 27), which is followed by the
Adhvaryu's call 'om *s*râvaya' and the Âgnîdhra's response 'astu
*s*rausha*t*.' Thereupon the Hot*ri*, having been called upon by the
Adhvaryu to give the offering-prayer to Agni (or Soma), recites the
respective yâ*g*yâ, at the concluding vausha*t* of which the oblation is
poured into the fire, (whilst the sacrificer utters the usual dedicatory
formula, 'This for Agni (Soma), not for me!')
