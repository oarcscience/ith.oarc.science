### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:1:3:1">1:1:3:1</span></span>1. He now
prepares two strainers (pavitra) <span id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110.md),
with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 12 a): 'Purifiers (or strainers, pavitra)
are ye, and belonging to Vish*n*u!' For Vish*n*u is the sacrifice; so
that he thereby says, 'You belong to the sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:1:3:2">1:1:3:2</span></span>2. Two
there are of them: for means of cleansing (pavitra) is this (wind) which
here ventilates (pavate); and this, it is true, ventilates as one only;
but on entering into man, it becomes a forward and a backward one, and
they are these two, to wit, the prâ*n*a (breathing out) and the udâna
(breathing up or in)  <span id="fr_111"></span>[2](#fn_111.md). And as this
(clarifying process) takes place

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

in accordance with the measure of that (process of breathing), therefore
there are two (strainers).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:1:3:3">1:1:3:3</span></span>3. There
may also be three: for the vyâna (or pervading vital air) <span
id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112) is a third (kind of breathing.md); but in
reality there are only two. Having then strained the sprinkling
water <span id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_113) with these two (strainers.md),
he sprinkles with it. The reason why he strains it with the two
(strainers) is this:

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:1:3:4">1:1:3:4</span></span>4.
V*ri*tra in truth lay covering all this (space) which here extends
between heaven and earth, And because he lay covering (v*ri*) all this,
therefore his name is V*ri*tra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:1:3:5">1:1:3:5</span></span>5. Him
Indra slew. He being slain flowed forth stinking in all directions
towards the water; for in every direction lies the ocean. And in
consequence of this, some of the waters became disgusted, and, rising
higher and higher, flowed over: whence (sprung) these grasses (of which
the strainers are made; for they represent the water which was not
putrified. With the other (water), however, some

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

matter has become mixed up, inasmuch as the putrid V*ri*tra flowed into
it. This he now removes from it by means of these two strainers;
whereupon he sprinkles with the (sacrificially) pure water. This is the
reason why he strains it through them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:1:3:6">1:1:3:6</span></span>6. He
strains it, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 12 b) 'By the impulse of
Savit*ri* I purify thee with this flawless purifier (or ventilator,
pavitra), with the rays of the sun!' For Savit*ri* is the impeller
(prasavit*ri*) of the gods, so that he strains this (water) as one
impelled by Savit*ri*. 'With this flawless purifier (ventilator,
pavitra),' he says, because this (wind) which here ventilates (or
purifies, pavate) is a flawless purifier. 'With the rays of the sun,' he
says, because they, the rays of the sun, are certainly purifying; and
for this reason he says, 'With the rays of the sun.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:1:3:7">1:1:3:7</span></span>7. Having
taken it (the water with the ladle) in his left hand, he makes it spirt
upwards with his right hand, and eulogises and glorifies it, with the
text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 12 c): 'Shining (or divine) waters! ye the
first-going, the first-drinking <span id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114.md)
ones!' For the waters are shining; and for this reason he says, 'Shining
waters!' 'First-going,' he calls them, because they flow towards the sea
and are therefore going in front (or forwards). 'First-drinking,' he
calls them, because they are the first that drink of king Soma <span
id="fr_115"></span>[2](#fn_115.md) and are therefore 'drinking first.' And
further: 'Forward now lead this sacrifice <span
id="fr_116"></span>[3](#fn_116.md),

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

forward the Lord of Sacrifice, the liberal, god-loving Lord of
Sacrifice!' whereby he says, 'Well (lead) the sacrifice, well the
sacrificer!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:1:3:8">1:1:3:8</span></span>8. And
further (Vâ*g*. S. I, 13 a): 'You Indra chose (for his companions) in
the battle against V*ri*tra!' For Indra, when he was battling with
V*ri*tra, did choose them (the waters) and with their help he killed
him; and for this reason he says, 'You Indra chose in the battle against
V*ri*tra!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:1:3:9">1:1:3:9</span></span>9. 'You
chose Indra in the battle against V*ri*tra!' for they, too, chose Indra
when he was battling with V*ri*tra, and with them he killed him:
therefore he says, 'You chose Indra in the battle against V*ri*tra!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:1:3:10">1:1:3:10</span></span>10. And
further (Vâ*g*. S. I, 13 d): 'Consecrated by sprinkling are ye!' With
these words he makes amends to them <span
id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117). He then sprinkles the (first.md)
oblation <span id="fr_118"></span>[2](#fn_118.md). One and the same meaning
applies to the (whole process of) sprinkling, viz. he thereby makes
sacrificially pure that (which he sprinkles).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:1:3:11">1:1:3:11</span></span>11. He
sprinkles, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 13 e): 'Thee, agreeable to Agni,
I sprinkle!' Thus for whichever deity the oblation is intended, for that
one he thereby renders it sacrificially pure. When he has in the same
way as before sprinkled (all) the oblations,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:1:3:12">1:1:3:12</span></span>12. He
then sprinkles the sacrificial vessels <span
id="fr_119"></span>[3](#fn_119.md),

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 13 g), 'Be ye pure for the divine work, for
the sacrifice to the gods!' for it is for the divine work, the sacrifice
to the gods, that he consecrates them. 'Whatever, that belongs to you,
the impure have defiled by touching, that I hereby purify for you!' For
whatever belonging to them some impure one--either a carpenter or some
other impure person--has on this occasion desecrated by touching, that
he thereby renders sacrificially pure for them by means of the water;
and therefore he says, 'Whatever, that belongs to you, the impure have
defiled by touching, that I hereby purify for you <span
id="fr_120"></span>[1](sbe1206.htm#fn_120.md)!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_110"></span>[19:1](sbe1205.htm#fr_110.md) These strainers (or
clarifiers) are to consist of two blades of Ku*s*a grass, with unbroken
or undecayed tops, and without buds on them; and they must be severed
from their roots by means of other Ku*s*a blades, so as to be of equal
length (viz. one prâde*s*a, or span of thumb and fore-finger, long).
Katy. Sr. II, 3, 31.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[19:2](sbe1205.htm#fr_111.md) Thus Sâya*n*a here
takes the terms prâ*n*a (i*d*âpiṅgalâdinâ*d*îdvârâ bahir nirga*kkh*an
prâ*n*a*h* prâṅ) and udâna (tathaiva dvârâ punar anta*h* pravi*s*an
pratyaṅ). In Ait. Br. II, 29, and *Kh*ând. Up. I, 3, 3, prâ*n*a, apâna,
and vyâna are mentioned as the <span id="page_20">p. 20</span> three
vital airs; where prâ*n*a is taken by Professors Haug and Müller as
'in-breathing' ('respiration' or 'expiration,' Röer), and apâna as
'out-breathing' ('inspiration,' Röer). Five vital airs are generally
enumerated (*S*at. Br. IX, 2, 2, 5); but theological speculation
evidently considered these bodily processes a very convenient source of
symbolism, as we find mention made in the *S*at. Br. of six (XIV, 1, 3,
32); seven (III, 1, 3, 21; XIII, 1, 7, 2); nine (I, 5, 2, 5); and ten
(XI, 6, 3, 7) breaths or vital airs.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[20:1](sbe1205.htm#fr_112.md) 'A combination of
the out-breathing and in-breathing;' but as there is no distinction
between this kind of breath and the others (combined), two must be
considered as the normal number of strainers. Schol.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[20:2](sbe1205.htm#fr_113.md) He pours water into
the Agnihotra ladle (in which some of the awn of the rice remains), and
after cleaning it with the two strainers, he sprinkles with it. Kâty.
II, 3, 33 seq. The details of this process are given in par. 6 seq.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[21:1](sbe1205.htm#fr_114.md) Agrepuva*h*;
Mahîdhara allows to it the alternative meaning first-purifying:

<span id="fn_115"></span>[21:2](sbe1205.htm#fr_115.md) 'Because, for the
sake of extracting the juice from the Soma-plants, water is poured on
them, so that the water drinks of the juice before the gods do.' Sây.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[21:3](sbe1205.htm#fr_116.md) I, e. 'carry the
sacrifice through without hindrance.' Mahîdh.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[22:1](sbe1205.htm#fr_117.md) He, in the first
place, sprinkles the sprinkling water in the ladle with itself; and the
guilt incurred in the act of consecrating it with itself, that is, with
something unconsecrated, is made amends for by the accompanying formula,
Sây. Similarly Mahîdhara: 'The unconsecrated (water) cannot consecrate
other (water).'

<span id="fn_118"></span>[22:2](sbe1205.htm#fr_118.md) Before doing so he
asks the Brahman's permission (cf. [p. 7](sbe1203.htm#page_7.md), note
[1](sbe1203.htm#fn_90).md), 'O Brahman! shall I sprinkle the oblation?'
when the latter, after muttering the mantra, 'Sprinkle the sacrifice!
gladden the deities,' &c., gives the permission by 'Õm! sprinkle!'
Paddh. on Kâty. II, 3, 36.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[22:3](sbe1205.htm#fr_119.md) According to some
authorities the vessels are placed together <span id="page_23">p.
23</span> on one heap, and are then consecrated together by one
sprinkling. According to others, each vessel must be consecrated
separately. Kâty. *S*r. II, 3, 39.
