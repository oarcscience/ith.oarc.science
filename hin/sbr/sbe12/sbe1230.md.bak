### SEVENTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:1">1:7:1:1</span></span>1. He
(the Adhvaryu) drives the calves away (from the cows) with a par*n*a
branch <span id="fr_423"></span>[1](#fn_420.md). The reason why he drives
the calves away with a par*n*a branch is this. When the Gâyatrî flew
towards Soma (the moon), a footless archer aiming at her while she was
carrying him off, severed one of the feathers (par*n*a) either of the
Gâyatrî or of king Soma <span id="fr_424"></span>[2](#fn_421.md); and on
falling down it became a par*n*a (palâ*s*a) tree; whence its name
par*n*a. May that

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

which then was of the Soma nature <span id="fr_425"></span>[1](#fn_422.md)
be here with us now!' so he thinks, and for this reason he drives away
the calves with a par*n*a branch.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:2">1:7:1:2</span></span>2. That
(branch) he cuts off <span id="fr_426"></span>[2](#fn_423.md), with the
formula (Vâ*g*. S. I, 1 a, b), 'For sap (I cut) thee! for pith
thee!'--'for rain thee' he means to say, when he says 'for sap thee;'
and when he says 'for pith thee' he means to say 'for that food-essence
which springs from the rain.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:3">1:7:1:3</span></span>3. They
then let the calves join their mothers. He thereupon touches (each) calf
(in order to drive it away from the cow), with the formula (Vâ*g*. S. I,
1 c), 'The winds are ye!'--for, indeed, it is this wind that here
blows <span id="fr_427"></span>[3](#fn_424), it is this (wind.md) that
makes swell all the rain that falls here; it is it that makes those
(cows) swell; and for this reason he says 'the winds are ye!' Some
people add here the formula <span id="fr_428"></span>[4](#fn_425.md),
'Going near are ye!' but let him not say this, because thereby another
(an enemy) approaches (the sacrificer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:4">1:7:1:4</span></span>4. After
separating one of the mothers from her calf, he touches her, with the
text (Vâ*g*. S. I, I d), 'May the divine Savit*ri* animate you--' for
Savit*ri*, indeed, is the impeller (prasavit*ri*) of the gods:

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'may they,
impelled by Savit*ri*, prepare the sacrifice!' so he thinks, and for
this reason he says, 'May the divine Savit*ri* animate you!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:5">1:7:1:5</span></span>5. '--To
the most glorious work!' for assuredly the sacrifice is the most
glorious work: hence, when he says 'to the most glorious work!' he means
to say 'to the sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:6">1:7:1:6</span></span>6. 'Make
swell, ye invincible (or inviolable) ones, the share for Indra!' In like
manner as then <span id="fr_429"></span>[1](#fn_426.md), taking the
sacrificial food (rice), he announces it to the deity, so now also he
announces that (libation of milk) to the deity when he says 'make swell,
ye invincible ones, the share for Indra!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:7">1:7:1:7</span></span>7. 'Over
you that are rich in offspring, over you that are free from suffering
and disease--;' in this there is nothing that is obscure; '--no thief,
no ill-wisher may lord it!'--he thereby means to say, 'may the evil
spirits, the Rakshas, not lord it over you!'--'May ye be numerous and
constant to this lord of cattle!'--thereby he means to say 'may ye be
numerous with this sacrificer, and not abandon him.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:8">1:7:1:8</span></span>8. He
then hides the branch on the front (eastern) side either of the
Âhavanîya or the Gârhapatya house, with the formula (Vâ*g*. S. I, 1 e),
'Protect the sacrificer's cattle!' he thus makes over the sacrificer's
cattle to it for protection by means of the Brahman (sacred writ).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:9">1:7:1:9</span></span>9. On it
he fastens a strainer (pavitram) <span id="fr_430"></span>[2](#fn_427.md),
with

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

the formula (Vâ*g*. S. I, 2 a), 'Vasu's means of purification
(ventilator, strainer, pavitram) art thou!' Vasu, indeed, is the
sacrifice: for this reason he says, 'Vasu's means of purification art
thou!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:10">1:7:1:10</span></span>10.
That night he performs the Agnihotra with rice-gruel (yavâgû). That
milk, namely, (which he milks that night) has already been announced as
sacrificial food to a (special) deity; hence, if he were to make the
offering with milk, he would offer to one deity that which has been set
apart as sacrificial food for another deity: this is the reason why on
that night he performs the Agnihotra with rice-gruel. As soon as they
have performed the Agnihotra, the pot is made ready. He (the Adhvaryu)
thereupon says, 'Announce that she (the cow) has been let loose to (the
calf)!' When he (or she, the milker <span
id="fr_431"></span>[1](#fn_428).md) announces, 'She has been let loose!'--

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:11">1:7:1:11</span></span>11. He
puts the pot on (the Gârhapatya hearth), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 2
b, c): 'Thou art the sky! thou art the earth!'--he praises and eulogises
her by thus saying, 'thou art the sky! thou art the
earth!'--'Mâtari*s*van's cauldron (gharma) art thou <span
id="fr_432"></span>[2](#fn_429)!' he thereby makes it (a means of.md)
sacrifice, and puts it on just as if he were putting on the

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (pravargya-)
cauldron (gharma) <span id="fr_433"></span>[1](#fn_430.md).--'All-holding
art thou! stand firm by the highest law! do not waver!'--thereby he
steadies it, renders it firm.--'May thy Lord of Sacrifice not
waver!'--the Lord of Sacrifice, doubtless, is the sacrificer, hence it
is for the sacrificer that he thereby prays for steadiness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:12">1:7:1:12</span></span>12. He
then puts the strainer (on the pot). He puts it down with the top turned
eastwards, for the east is the region of the gods; or with the top
turned northwards, for the north is the region of the men; means of
purification (pavitram) assuredly is that (wind) which here blows, it
sweeps across these worlds: let him therefore put it down with the front
northwards <span id="fr_434"></span>[2](#fn_431.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:13">1:7:1:13</span></span>13.
Just as then (i.e. at the Soma-sacrifice) they clarify king Soma with a
strainer, in like manner he now clarifies (the milk); and since the
strainer wherewith on that occasion they clarify king Soma has its
fringe directed towards the north, therefore let him now also put it
down with the top northward.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:14">1:7:1:14</span></span>14. He
puts it down, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 3 a), 'Vasu's means of
purification (pavitram) art thou!'--Vasu, indeed, is the sacrifice: for
this reason he says, 'Vasu's means of purification art thou! flowing in
a hundred streams, flowing in a thousand streams!'--he praises and
eulogises it when he says, 'flowing in a hundred streams, flowing in a
thousand streams.'

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:15">1:7:1:15</span></span>15. He
now maintains silence as long as the milking of the three (cows) lasts,
for the sacrifice, doubtless, is speech: 'May I perform the sacrifice
undisturbed!' so he thinks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:16">1:7:1:16</span></span>16.
When it (the milk of each of the three cows) is poured (by the milker
from the wooden pail through the strainer into the pot), he (the
Adhvaryu) consecrates it by (whispering each time) the formula (Vâ*g*.
S. I, 3 b), 'May the divine Savit*ri* purify thee with Vasu's means of
purification, well cleansing and flowing in a hundred streams!' for just
as then (at the Soma-sacrifice) they clarify king Soma with a strainer,
so he thereby clarifies (the milk).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:17">1:7:1:17</span></span>17. He
then says (Vâ*g*. S. I, 3-4), 'Which didst thou milk?' 'Such and such a
one,' (the milker replies.) 'This one is Vi*s*vâyu (containing all
life),' he (the Adhvaryu) says. He then <span
id="fr_435"></span>[1](#fn_432.md) asks regarding the second one, 'Which
didst thou milk?' 'Such and such a one,' is the reply. 'This one is
Vi*s*vakarman (all-doing),' he says. He then asks regarding the third,
'Which didst thou milk?' 'Such and such a one,' is the reply. 'This one
is Vi*s*vadhâyas (all-sustaining),' he says. The reason why he thus asks
is that he thereby bestows certain energies on them. Three (cows) he
milks, for three are these worlds: he thereby renders them fit for these
worlds. He is now at liberty to speak.

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:18">1:7:1:18</span></span>18.
After having the last (cow) milked, and having poured a drop of water
into the pail which he has made the milker use, and stirred it, he pours
it to (the milk) <span id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_433.md), thinking 'what
milk was left there, let that also be here!'--(he does so) for the
completeness of the sap; for when it rains here, then plants spring up,
and on the plants being eaten and the water drunk, thence is this juice
produced: and therefore (the water is poured to the milk) for the
completeness of the sap. Having then taken it off (the fire), he
coagulates it <span id="fr_437"></span>[2](#fn_434.md): he thereby makes it
sharp (pungent); for this reason he coagulates it, after taking it off
(the fire).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:19">1:7:1:19</span></span>19. He
coagulates it, with the formula (Vâ*g*. S. I, 4 d), 'With Soma I
coagulate thee, the portion of Indra!' Just as on a former
occasion <span id="fr_438"></span>[3](#fn_435.md), when taking sacrificial
food for a deity, he announces it (to that deity), in like manner he now
announces it to the deity, saying, 'Thee, the portion of Indra!' By
saying 'with Soma I coagulate thee,' he makes it palatable to the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:20">1:7:1:20</span></span>20. He
then covers it over by a vessel <span id="fr_439"></span>[4](#fn_436.md),
with the hollow part upwards and containing water, 'lest the evil
spirits, the Rakshas, should touch it from above;' for water, indeed, is
a thunderbolt; hence

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

he thus drives away from it the evil spirits, the Rakshas, with a
thunderbolt: this is the reason why he covers it over by a vessel with
the hollow part upwards and containing water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:1:21">1:7:1:21</span></span>21. He
covers it over, with the formula (Vâ*g*. S. I, 4 e), 'O Vish*n*u,
protect the oblation!' for Vish*n*u, indeed, is the sacrifice; hence he
thereby makes over this sacrificial food to the sacrifice for
protection: for this reason he says, 'O Vish*n*u, protect the oblation!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_420"></span>[183:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_423.md) Par*n*a = palâ*s*a,
Butea Frondosa.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[183:2](sbe1230.htm#fr_424.md) Gâyatryai vâ
somasya vâ='both of G. and of S.,' Sâya*n*a. Apâd astâ, 'a footless
shooter,' is a doubtful reading and perhaps an old corruption; Sâya*n*a
reads apâdhastâ (? adhastât); cf. Weber, various readings, p. 133. The
Kâ*n*va MS. reads, 'devebhyas tasyâ âharantyâ avâdastâbhyâyatya
par*n*a*m* pra*k*i*kh*eda.' According to Rig-veda IV, 27, 3, it was the
archer K*ris*ânu, who hit the falcon when it was carrying off the Soma
from heaven, and brought down one of its feathers. On the whole myth,
see A. Kuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers and des Göttertranks, p. 137 seq. Cf.
Taitt. S. III, 5, 7, 1; Taitt. Br. I, 1, 3, 10, 'Soma was in the third
heaven from here; Gâyatrî fetched him away; one of his feathers was cut
off, it became a par*n*a (palâ*s*a) tree.' Similarly Taitt. Br. I, 2, 1,
6; see also *S*at. Br. I, 8, 2, 10.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[184:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_425.md) 'Somasya nyaktam,'
see [p. 167](sbe1228.htm#page_167), note [2](sbe1228.htm#fn_388.md).

<span id="fn_423"></span>[184:2](sbe1230.htm#fr_426.md) This act as well as
that of letting the calves join the cows, of course, precedes the
driving away of the calves. These proceedings take place on the day
before the new moon, after the agnyanvâdhâna. According to Kâty., the
sacrificer enters on the vow of abstinence, after the branch has been
cut. Previously to these rites, however, the so-called
Pi*nd*a-pit*ri*ya*gñ*a, or oblation of obsequial pi*nd*as (balls,
dumplings) to the deceased ancestors, has to be performed; for which see
II, 4, 2, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[184:3](sbe1230.htm#fr_427.md) Pavate, 'blows,
purifies.'

<span id="fn_425"></span>[184:4](sbe1230.htm#fr_428.md) Thus Taitt. S. I,
1, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[185:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_429.md) Viz. on the
occasion of his taking from the cart the rice for the oblations, see I,
1, 2, 17-19.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[185:2](sbe1230.htm#fr_430.md) See [p.
19](sbe1204.htm#page_19), note [1](sbe1205.htm#fn_110.md). According to
Karka this takes place before the hiding of the branch, Scholl. on Kâty.
IV, 2, 15. According to Kâty. IV, 2, 12, 13, the upavesha (see I, 2, 1,
3) is cut at this juncture--with the text, 'Accomplishing (vesha) art
thou'--from the bottom part of the palâ*s*a branch on the remaining part
<span id="page_186">p. 186</span> of which he thereupon fixes the
strainer. When the sânnâyya oblation is not made (and consequently no
palâ*s*a branch is used), the upavesha is made of vara*n*a wood.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[186:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_431.md) The milker may be
anybody except a Sûdra, Taitt. Br. III, 2, 3, 9; Kâty. IV, 2, 22; Âpast.
I, 12, 25.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[186:2](sbe1230.htm#fr_432.md) Mâtari*s*van's
cauldron is identified in Taitt. Br. III, 2, 3, 2 with the atmosphere.
Mâtari*s*van, though sometimes identified with the wind, is more
generally either a name of Agni, or the name of a mythic personage who
(Prometheus-like) is supposed to have fetched the fire from heaven and
brought it to the Bh*ri*gus, who communicated it to man. See Roth, Nir.
p. 111; Kuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers and des Göttertranks, p. 5 seq.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[187:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_433.md) See I, 2, 2, 7, and
note. Compare also the interesting introduction to Dr. Garbe's edition
and translation of Âpastamba's aphorisms on the Pravargya ceremony,
Zeitsch. der D. Morg. Ges. XXXIV, p. 319 seq.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[187:2](sbe1230.htm#fr_434.md) The direction from
west to east is the chief one in all sacrificial arrangements: hence
that from south to north is the one that lies across the former.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[188:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_435.md) That is, when the
milk has been poured through the strainer as before. The Taittirîya
school make the mystic names (or epithets) of the three cows Vi*s*vâyu,
Vi*s*vavya*k*as (all-embracing), and Vi*s*vakarman, cf. Taitt. S. I, 1,
3; Taitt. Br. III, 2, 3, 7. In the latter passage these names are, as
here, identified with the earth, atmosphere, and heavens respectively.
The milker, in replying to the Adhvaryu, apparently calls the cows by
their ordinary names. Cf. [p. 178](sbe1229.htm#page_178.md), note
[4](sbe1229.htm#fn_412.md).

<span id="fn_433"></span>[189:1](sbe1230.htm#fr_436.md) According to Taitt.
S. I, 1, 3, Kâty. IV, 2, 32, &c., he, whilst doing so, pronounces the
text, 'Unite, ye that follow the eternal law, ye waving ones (with the
wave, Katy.), ye sweetest,--\[filling the milk with honey, Kâty.\],--ye
delightful ones, for the obtainment of wealth!'

<span id="fn_434"></span>[189:2](sbe1230.htm#fr_437.md) Viz. by adding to
it the (sour) milk that is left from the performance of the Agnihotra.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[189:3](sbe1230.htm#fr_438.md) See I, 1, 2, 18.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[189:4](sbe1230.htm#fr_439.md) According to Taitt.
Br. III, 2, 3, 11, it may be either a metal or wooden vessel, but not an
earthen one (Kâty. IV, 2, 34).
