### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:1">1:3:2:1</span></span>1. Now
the sacrifice is the man. The sacrifice is the man for the reason that
the man spreads (performs) it; and that in being spread it is made of
exactly the same extent as the man <span
id="fr_236"></span>[1](#fn_236.md): this is the reason why the sacrifice is
the man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:2">1:3:2:2</span></span>2. The
*g*uhû (spoon) further belongs to that (man-shaped sacrifice), and so
does the upabh*ri*t; and the dhruvâ <span
id="fr_237"></span>[2](#fn_237.md) represents its trunk. Now it is from the

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

trunk that all these limbs proceed, and for this reason the entire
sacrifice proceeds from the dhruvâ.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:3">1:3:2:3</span></span>3. The
dipping-spoon (sruva, masc.) is no other than the breath. This breath
passes through (or, goes to) all the limbs, and for that reason the
dipping-spoon goes to all the offering-spoons (sru*k*, fem.).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:4">1:3:2:4</span></span>4. That
*g*uhû further is to him no other than yonder sky, and the upabh*ri*t
this atmosphere, and the dhruvâ this same (earth). Now it is from this
(earth) that all the worlds originate: and from the dhruvâ, therefore,
the whole sacrifice proceeds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:5">1:3:2:5</span></span>5. The
dipping-spoon then is no other than that blowing one (the wind); it is
this that sweeps across all these worlds: and for that reason the sruva
goes to all the offering-spoons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:6">1:3:2:6</span></span>6. Now
when this sacrifice is being performed, it is performed for the gods,
the seasons, and the metres (or sacred texts). To the gods belongs what
sacrificial food there is, to wit, king Soma and the sacrificial cake:
all this he takes, while announcing it with the formula, 'I take thee,
agreeable to so and so!' for thus it becomes theirs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:7">1:3:2:7</span></span>7. And
whatever oblations of butter are taken, they are taken for the seasons
and the metres. Every one of them he takes in the form of butter without
announcing it (to any particular deity). In the *g*uhû he takes of it
four times (with the sruva from the pot), in the upabh*ri*t eight
times <span id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_238.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:8">1:3:2:8</span></span>8. Now
when he takes of it four times (with the sruva) in the *g*uhû, he takes
it for the seasons, since

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

he takes it for the fore-offerings <span
id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_239.md), and the fore-offerings are the seasons:
all this he takes in the form of butter without making any announcement,
in order to avoid sameness; for if he were to take it with the formulas
'For Spring (I take) thee!' 'For Summer--thee!' he would commit (the
fault of) a repetition <span id="fr_240"></span>[2](#fn_240.md): he
therefore takes it in the form of butter without making any
announcement.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:9">1:3:2:9</span></span>9. When,
on the other hand, he takes eight times (with the sruva) in the
upabh*ri*t, he takes it for the metres <span
id="fr_241"></span>[3](#fn_241.md), since it is for the
after-offerings <span id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_239.md) that he takes it;
and the after-offerings are the metres: all this he takes in the form of
butter without making any announcement, in order to avoid sameness; for
were he to take it with the formulas 'For the Gâyatrî--thee!' 'For the
Trish*t*ubh--thee!' he would commit a repetition: he therefore takes it
in the form of butter without making any announcement.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:10">1:3:2:10</span></span>10.
Again, when he takes four times (with the sruva)

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

in the dhruvâ, he takes it for the whole sacrifice, and all this he
takes in the form of butter without making any announcement. To whom
indeed should he announce it, since he cuts it off for all the deities?
He therefore takes it in the form of butter without making any
announcement.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:11">1:3:2:11</span></span>11. Now
the sacrificer stands behind the *g*uhû, and he who means evil to him
stands behind the upabh*ri*t. The eater stands behind the *g*uhû, and
what (or, he who) is to be eaten stands behind the upabh*ri*t. And the
*g*uhû, indeed, is the eater, and the upabh*ri*t is that which is to be
eaten. In the *g*uhû he takes four times (with the sruva), and in the
upabh*ri*t eight times.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:12">1:3:2:12</span></span>12. Now
when he takes four times (butter) in the *g*uhû, he thereby makes the
eater more limited, smaller; and when he takes eight times in the
upabh*ri*t, he makes that which is to be eaten more unlimited, more
abundant: for a flourishing condition indeed exists where the eater is
smaller and that which is to be eaten more abundant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:13">1:3:2:13</span></span>13. In
taking four times in the *g*uhû, he takes (altogether) more butter, and
in taking eight times in the upabh*ri*t he takes less butter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:14">1:3:2:14</span></span>14. For
when, in taking four times (butter with the sruva) in the *g*uhû, he
takes more butter, he thereby, in making the eater more limited,
smaller, imparts vigour and strength to him. And when, in taking eight
times in the upabh*ri*t, he takes less butter, he thereby, in making
that which (or, him who) is to be eaten more unlimited, more abundant,
makes it (or, him) vigourless and weaker. And thus a king who has
established himself among a numberless people, subdues them even from a
single dwelling,

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

and takes possession of whatever he likes <span
id="fr_243"></span>[1](#fn_242.md): with that very same energy (the
Adhvaryu acts) when he takes a greater quantity of butter in the *g*uhû.
Now what he takes in the *g*uhû, that he offers with the *g*uhû; and
what he takes in the upabh*ri*t, that also he offers with the *g*uhû.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:15">1:3:2:15</span></span>15. And
in reference to this point they say: 'Wherefore then is he to take it in
the upabh*ri*t, if he does not offer it with the upabh*ri*t?' Now, if he
were to offer it with the upabh*ri*t, those subjects (of the king) would
assuredly become separated from him, nor would there be either an eater
or what is to be eaten. When, on the other hand, he pours (the butter)
together and thus offers it with the *g*uhû, thereby the people pay
tribute to the Kshatriya. Hence by what he takes in the upabh*ri*t, the
Vai*s*ya (man of the people), under the rule of the Kshatriya, becomes
possessed of cattle; and when he pours (the butter) together and offers
it with the *g*uhû, thereby the Kshatriya, whenever he likes, says,
'Hallo Vai*s*ya, just bring to me what thou hast stored away!' Thus he
both subdues him and obtains possession of anything he wishes by dint of
this very energy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:16">1:3:2:16</span></span>16.
These butter-portions, then, are taken for the metres. Now what he takes
in the *g*uhû (by ladling) four times (with the sruva), that he takes
for the gâyatrî; and what he takes in the upabh*ri*t (by ladling) eight
times, that he takes for the trish*t*ubh and *g*agatî; and what he takes
in the dhruvâ (by

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

ladling) four times, that he takes for the anush*t*ubh. For the
anush*t*ubh is speech, and from speech all this (universe) springs:
hence it is from the dhruvâ that the whole sacrifice originates. The
anush*t*ubh also is this (earth), and from it all this (universe)
originates: hence it is from the dhruvâ that the whole sacrifice
originates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:17">1:3:2:17</span></span>17. He
takes (butter with the sruva), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 31), 'Verily,
thou art the favourite resort (or, dainty) of the gods!' He thereby
makes that butter the most favourite resort of the gods: for this reason
he says, 'verily, thou art the favourite resort of the gods!'--'An
unassailable means of worship!' the butter is indeed a thunderbolt:
therefore he says, 'an unassailable means of worship!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:2:18">1:3:2:18</span></span>18.
Once he puts (butter with the sruva) into the *g*uhû with this formula,
three times silently. With the same formula he puts (butter) once into
the upabh*ri*t, seven times silently. With the same formula he puts once
(butter) into the dhruvâ, three times silently. Now, as to this, they
say, 'Thrice he should take with the formula in each case, for threefold
is the sacrifice.' Nevertheless (it is done) only once with each
(spoon), for it is just in this way that the taking thrice (with a
formula) is accomplished.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_236"></span>[78:1](sbe1213.htm#fr_236.md) The sacrifice is the
representation of the sacrificer himself; and hence its dimensions are
to be those of a man, viz. the altar (vedi) on its western side is to
measure a fathom, or space between the extreme ends of the outstretched
arms (? of the sacrificer), which is supposed to be equal to the size of
a man; see I, 2, 5, 14. Originally these measurements were no doubt
relative to the size of the sacrificer; but it is doubtful whether this
was still the case at the time of our author.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[78:2](sbe1213.htm#fr_237.md) For a description of
these spoons, see [p. 67](sbe1211.htm#page_67.md), note
[2](sbe1212.htm#fn_207.md). The *g*uhû is supposed to represent the right,
and the upabh*ri*t the left arm, and the dhruvâ the trunk.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[79:1](sbe1213.htm#fr_238.md) He takes butter in
the *g*uhû and upabh*ri*t by four or eight ladlings with the
dipping-spoon. As we learn further on, the quantity taken in the *g*uhû,
by ladling four times, should exceed that in the upabh*ri*t, although
the latter requires eight ladlings. Cf. Katy. II, 7, 13.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[80:1](sbe1213.htm#fr_242.md) On the prayâ*g*as,
or oblations of clarified butter introductory to, and the anuyâ*g*as,
oblations of the same material made subsequently to, the chief
sacrifice, see I, 5, 3, 1 seq., and I, 8, 2, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[80:2](sbe1213.htm#fr_240.md) Repetition of one
and the same sacrificial act on the same day is to be avoided, as far as
possible. The repetition in the present case would consist in his
announcing the butter-oblations to the several deities in the same way
as he has done in regard to the rice-portions. See I, 1, 2, 17-18.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[80:3](sbe1213.htm#fr_241.md) On the frequent
symbolical employment of the metres in the ritual, as the embodiment of
supreme harmony and the efficacy of prayer, see Weber, Ind. Stud. VIII,
8 seq. The three principal Vedic metres are the gâyatrî (three times
eight syllables), the trish*t*ubh (four times eleven syllables), and the
*g*agatî (four times twelve syllables); and three anuyâ*g*as there are
at these sacrifices, viz. to the barhis or sacrificial grass, to
Narâ*s*a*m*sa and Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t respectively. In the present
instance (see par. 16) the trish*t*ubh and *g*agatî metres are taken
together as one, and as a fourth is added the anush*t*ubh (four times
eight syllables).

<span id="fn_242"></span>[82:1](sbe1213.htm#fr_243.md) Tasmâd uta
râ*g*âpârâ*m* vi*s*am prâvasâyâpy ekave*s*manaiva ('by one who has a
single dwelling, i.e. by himself,' Sâya*n*a) *g*inâti tvad yathâ tvat
kâmayate tathâ sa*k*ate. The MS. of the Kâ*n*va text has: 'Tasmât
kshatriyo râ*g*otâpârâd vi*s*am prâvasâya *g*inâti tvad yathâ tva(t)
kâmayate tat karoti.'
