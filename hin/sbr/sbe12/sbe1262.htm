<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:1">2:6:3:1</A></FONT></span>1. Verily, imperishable is the righteousness of him that offers the Seasonal sacrifices; for such a one gains the year, and hence there is no cessation for him. He gains it (the year) in three divisions, he conquers it in three divisions. The year means the whole, and the whole is imperishable (without end): hence his righteousness is indeed imperishable. Moreover, he thereby becomes a Season, and as such goes to the gods; but there is no perishableness in the gods, and hence there is imperishable righteousness for him. This, then, is why he offers the Seasonal sacrifices.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:2">2:6:3:2</A></FONT></span>2. Then as to why he should perform the <I>S</I>un&acirc;s&icirc;rya offering. The prosperity (<I>s</I>r&icirc;) that accrued to the gods on performing the S&acirc;kamedha offerings, and gaining the victory (over V<I>ri</I>tra), is <I>s</I>una; and the essence (rasa) that belonged to the year gained by them is s&icirc;ra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_999"></A><A HREF="#fn_995"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Now that same prosperity which</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_445"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 445</FONT></A></p>  
<p>accrued to the gods on performing the S&acirc;kamedha offerings, and that same essence which belonged to the year gained by them,--both these he takes possession of and makes his own: that is why he performs the <I>S</I>un&acirc;s&icirc;rya.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:3">2:6:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. The mode of its performance (is as follows): They prepare no uttaravedi; they do not use clotted butter; nor do they churn the fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1000"></A><A HREF="#fn_996"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. There are five fore-offerings, three after-offerings, and one Samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:4">2:6:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. Then, in the first place, there are those five (regular) oblations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1001"></A><A HREF="#fn_997"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. By means of these oblations, indeed, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati produced creatures; with them he delivered the creatures both ways from Varu<I>n</I>a's noose; with them the gods slew V<I>ri</I>tra and gained that victory which was gained by them. And so does he, by means of them, obtain and make his own, both that prosperity which accrued to the gods from performing the S&acirc;kamedha offerings, and that essence of the year which was gained by them. This is why those five oblations are (offered).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:5">2:6:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. Then follows a <I>S</I>un&acirc;s&icirc;rya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1002"></A><A HREF="#fn_998"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> cake on twelve</p>

<p><A NAME="page_446"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 446</FONT></A></p>  
<p>potsherds. The import of this <I>S</I>un&acirc;s&icirc;rya oblation is what we have stated before.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:6">2:6:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. After that there is an (oblation of) milk&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1003"></A><A HREF="#fn_999"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to V&acirc;yu. Now it is to milk that living beings readily take, when they are born: 'May the creatures readily take to me--now that I have gained the victory (by means of the S&acirc;kamedha offerings)--for my prosperity, glory, and support!' so he thinks, and hence that (oblation of) milk.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:7">2:6:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. Then as to why it is (offered) to V&acirc;yu. Now V&acirc;yu, indeed, is yonder blowing (wind); it is he that makes swell whatever rain falls here. But it is by the rain that plants grow; and on the plants being eaten and the water drunk, milk is produced out of that water. Hence it is he (V&acirc;yu) that produces it; and for this reason it is (offered) to V&acirc;yu.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:8">2:6:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. Then follows a cake on one potsherd for S&ucirc;rya. Now S&ucirc;rya, indeed, is yonder scorching (sun); it is he that governs all this (world), now by means of a good, now by a bad (king)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1004"></A><A HREF="#fn_1000"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; he assigns its place to everything here, now under a good, now under a bad (king): 'Now that I have obtained the victory, may he, in his pleasure, govern me through a good (king), may he assign to me a place under a good (king)!' thus he thinks; and for this reason there is a cake on one potsherd for S&ucirc;rya.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:9">2:6:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. The priests' fee for this (oblation to S&ucirc;rya)</p>

<p><A NAME="page_447"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 447</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is a white horse&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1005"></A><A HREF="#fn_1001"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; whereby it is made of the characteristic form of yonder scorching (sun). If he be unable to procure a white horse, it may be a white bull; whereby it is likewise made of the characteristic form of yonder scorching (sun).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:10">2:6:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. He may offer the <I>S</I>un&acirc;s&icirc;rya at the same time when he performs the S&acirc;kamedha offerings. By offering (Seasonal sacrifices) three times in the year, he indeed obtains the (whole) year: he may therefore offer (the <I>S</I>un&acirc;s&icirc;rya) at any time&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1006"></A><A HREF="#fn_1002"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:11">2:6:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. Here now some wish to take possession of the nights; and should he wish to take possession of the nights, let him offer the <I>S</I>un&acirc;s&icirc;rya (on the day) when, previously to the full-moon of Ph&acirc;lguna, (the new moon) becomes visible in yonder sky.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:12">2:6:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. Let him then get consecrated (for the Soma-sacrifice), lest the Ph&acirc;lguna full-moon again pass by without his offering (Soma). For were the Ph&acirc;lguna full-moon again to pass by without his having</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_448"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 448</FONT></A></p>  
<p>offered (Soma), he would certainly have to begin anew (to perform the Seasonal offerings): hence the Ph&acirc;lguna full-moon should not again pass by without his offering Soma. Such (is the rule) for him who discontinues (the Seasonal offerings).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:13">2:6:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. And in the case of one who recommences (the Seasonal offerings),--let him perform the <I>S</I>un&acirc;s&icirc;rya on the day preceding the Ph&acirc;lguna full-moon, and on the following day the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva, and after that the Full-moon offering. This, then, (is the rule) for him who recommences (the Seasonal offerings).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:14">2:6:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. Then as to (the Sacrificer) shaving his head all round&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1007"></A><A HREF="#fn_1003"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Now yonder sun, indeed, faces every quarter; it drinks up whatever (moisture) it dries up here: hence this (Sacrificer) thereby faces every quarter and becomes a consumer of food.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:15">2:6:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. This fire also faces every quarter, since it burns all they put into it from whatsoever quarter: hence this (Sacrificer) thereby faces every quarter and becomes a consumer of food.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:16">2:6:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. This man, on the other hand, faces but one quarter; but by shaving his head all round he comes to face every quarter; and whosoever, knowing this, has his head shaved all round, becomes just such a consumer of food as those two: let him therefore have his head shaved all round.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:6:3:17">2:6:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. And on this point &Acirc;suri said, 'What in the world has it to do with his face, even if he were to shave off all the hair of his head! It is by offering</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_449"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 449</FONT></A></p>  
<p>thrice in the year that he comes to face all the quarters and becomes a consumer of food: let him therefore not trouble himself about shaving his head.'</p>

On account of this contradiction, the commentators, on K&acirc;ty. V, 11, 3, consider the churning of the fire as optional. But, if the fires were produced by 'churning,' nine fore-offerings and after-offerings would have to be performed, as at the other Seasonal sacrifices, which is expressly forbidden in the above passage. According to K&acirc;ty. himself, the <I>S</I>un&acirc;s&icirc;rya is to be treated like an ordinary ish<I>t</I>i, except that the barhis is to be tied together in the way prescribed for the Seasonal offerings; see II, 5, 1, 18.</P>

V, 11, 3). Our author, however, evidently favours the views set forth in the succeeding paragraphs. According to these, the householder who wishes to discontinue the Seasonal offerings after the first round, and to become a Soma-sacrificer, is to perform the <I>S</I>un&acirc;s&icirc;rya on the first day of the waxing moon of Ph&acirc;lguna, and then to undergo the d&icirc;ksh&acirc;, or rite of consecration for the Soma-sacrifice (see III, 1, 2, 1 seq.), either immediately or before the approaching full-moon, when he is to perform the Agnish<I>t</I>oma (or an animal offering to Agni and Soma or an &Acirc;gney&icirc; ish<I>t</I>i, K&acirc;ty. V, 11, 15). If, on the other hand, he intends to continue the <I>K</I>&acirc;turm&acirc;syas for another year (or more), he is to perform the <I>S</I>un&acirc;s&icirc;rya on the upavasatha, or day preceding the full-moon.</P>
