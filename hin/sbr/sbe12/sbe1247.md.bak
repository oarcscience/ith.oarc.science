### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### II. THE AGNIHOTRA OR MORNING AND EVENING LIBATIONS; AND THE AGNY-UPASTHÂNA OR HOMAGE TO THE FIRES.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:1">2:2:4:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati alone, indeed, existed here in the beginning. He considered,
'How may I be reproduced?'

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He toiled and
performed acts of penance. He generated Agni from his mouth; and because
he generated him from his mouth, therefore Agni is a consumer of food:
and, verily, he who thus knows Agni to be a consumer of food, becomes
himself a consumer of food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:2">2:2:4:2</span></span>2. He
thus generated him first (agre) of the gods; and therefore (he is
called) Agni, for agni (they say) is the same as agri. He, being
generated, went forth as the first (pûrva); for of him who goes first,
they say that he goes at the head (agre). Such, then, is the origin and
nature of that Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:3">2:2:4:3</span></span>3.
Pra*g*âpati then considered, 'In that Agni I have generated a food-eater
for myself; but, indeed, there is no other food here but myself, whom,
surely, he would not eat.' At that time this earth had, indeed, been
rendered quite bald; there were neither plants nor trees. This, then,
weighed on his mind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:4">2:2:4:4</span></span>4.
Thereupon Agni turned towards him with open mouth; and he (Pra*g*âpati)
being terrified, his own greatness departed from him. Now his own
greatness is his speech: that speech of his departed from him. He
desired an offering in his own self, and rubbed (his hands); and because
he rubbed (his hands), therefore both this and this (palm) are hairless.
He then obtained either a butter-offering or a milk-offering;--but,
indeed, they are both milk.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:5">2:2:4:5</span></span>5. This
(offering), however, did not satisfy him, because it had hairs mixed
with it. He poured it away (into the fire), saying, 'Drink, while
burning (osha*m* dhaya)!' From it plants sprang: hence their name
'plants (oshadhaya*h*).' He rubbed (his hands) a second time, and
thereby obtained another

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

offering, either a butter-offering or a milk-offering;--but, indeed,
they are both milk.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:6">2:2:4:6</span></span>6. This
(offering) then satisfied him. He hesitated: 'Shall I offer it up? shall
I not offer it up?' he thought. His own greatness said to him, 'Offer it
up!' Pra*g*âpati was aware that it was his own (sva) greatness that had
spoken (âha) to him; and offered it up with 'Svâhâ!' This is why
offerings are made with 'Svâhâ!' Thereupon that burning one (viz. the
sun) rose; and then that blowing one (viz. the wind) sprang up;
whereupon, indeed, Agni turned away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:7">2:2:4:7</span></span>7. And
Pra*g*âpati, having performed offering, reproduced himself, and saved
himself from Agni, Death, as he was about to devour him. And, verily,
whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, reproduces himself by
offspring even as Pra*g*âpati reproduced himself; and saves himself from
Agni, Death, when he is about to devour him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:8">2:2:4:8</span></span>8. And
when he dies, and when they place him on the fire, then he is born
(again) out of the fire, and the fire only consumes his body. Even as he
is born from his father and mother, so is he born from the fire. But he
who offers not the Agnihotra, verily, he does not come into life at all:
therefore the Agnihotra should by all means be offered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:9">2:2:4:9</span></span>9. And as
to that same birth from out of doubt,--when Pra*g*âpati doubted, he,
while doubting, remained steadfast on the better (side), insomuch that
he reproduced himself and saved himself from Agni, Death, when he was
about to devour him: so he also who knows that birth from out of doubt,
when he doubts about anything, still remains on the better (side).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:10">2:2:4:10</span></span>10.
Having offered, he rubbed (his hands). Thence

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

a Vikaṅkata <span id="fr_741"></span>[1](#fn_737.md) tree sprung forth; and
therefore that tree is suitable for the sacrifice, and proper for
sacrificial vessels. Thereupon those (three) heroes among the gods were
born, viz. Agni, that blower (Vâyu), and Sûrya: and, verily, whosoever
thus knows those heroes among the gods, to him a hero is born.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:11">2:2:4:11</span></span>11.
They then said, 'We come after our father Pra*g*âpati: let us then
create what shall come after us!' Having enclosed (a piece of ground),
they sang praises with the gâyatrî stanza without the 'Hiṅ <span
id="fr_742"></span>[2](#fn_738):' and that (with.md) which they enclosed
was the ocean; and this earth was the praising-ground (âstâva).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:12">2:2:4:12</span></span>12.
When they had sung praises, they went out towards the east, saying, 'We
(will) go back thither!' The gods came upon a cow which had sprung into
existence. Looking up at them, she uttered the sound 'hiṅ.' The gods
perceived that this was the 'Hiṅ' of the Sâman (melodious sacrificial
chant); for heretofore (their song was) without the but after that it
was the (real) Sâman. And as this same sound 'Hiṅ' of the Sâman was in
the cow, therefore the latter affords the means of subsistence; and so
does he afford the means of subsistence whosoever thus knows that 'Hiṅ'
of the Sâman in the cow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:13">2:2:4:13</span></span>13.
They said, 'Auspicious, indeed, is what we have produced here, who have
produced the cow: for, truly, she is the sacrifice, and without her no
sacrifice is performed; she is also the food, for the cow, indeed, is
all food.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:14">2:2:4:14</span></span>14.
This (word 'go'), then, is a name of those

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (cows), and so it
is of the sacrifice: let him, therefore, repeat <span
id="fr_743"></span>[1](#fn_739) it, (as it were.md) saying, 'Good,
excellent!' and, verily, whosoever, knowing this, repeats it; (as it
were) saying, 'Good, excellent!' with him those (cows) multiply, and the
sacrifice will incline to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:15">2:2:4:15</span></span>15.
Now, Agni coveted her: 'May I pair with her,' he thought. He united with
her, and his seed became that milk of hers: hence, while the cow is raw,
that milk in her is cooked (warm); for it is Agni's seed; and therefore
also, whether it be in a black or in a red (cow), it is ever white, and
shining like fire, it being Agni's seed. Hence it is warm when first
milked; for it is Agni's seed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:16">2:2:4:16</span></span>16.
They (the men) said, 'Come, let us offer this up!'--'To whom of us shall
they first offer this?' (said those gods).--'To me!' said Agni.--'To
me!' said that blower (Vâyu).--'To me!' said Sûrya. They did not come to
an agreement; and not being agreed, they said, 'Let us go to our father
Pra*g*âpati; and to whichever of us he says it shall be offered first,
to him they shall first offer this.' They went to their father
Pra*g*âpati, and said, 'To whom of us shall they offer this first?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:17">2:2:4:17</span></span>17. He
replied, 'To Agni: Agni will forthwith cause his own seed to be
reproduced, and so you will be reproduced.' 'Then to thee,' he said to
Sûrya; 'and what of the offered (milk) he then is still possessed of,
that shall belong to that blower

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Vâyu)!' And,
accordingly, they in the same way offer this (milk) to them till this
day: in the evening to Agni, and in the morning to Sûrya; and what of
the offered (milk) he then is still possessed of, that, indeed, belongs
to that blower.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:4:18">2:2:4:18</span></span>18. By
offering, those gods were produced in the way in which they were
produced, by it they gained that victory which they did gain: Agni
conquered this world, Vâyu the air, and Sûrya the sky. And whosoever,
knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, he, indeed, is produced in the same
way in which they were then produced, he gains that same victory which
they then gained;--indeed, he shares the same world with them,
whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra. Therefore the Agnihotra
should certainly be performed.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[325:1](sbe1247.htm#fr_741.md) The sruva, or
dipping-spoon, and the Agnihotra ladle, for instance, are made of this
wood; see [p. 331](sbe1248.htm#page_331), note [2](sbe1248.htm#fn_746.md).

essential element in the recitation of Sâma-chants, see I, 4, 1, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[326:1](sbe1247.htm#fr_743.md) Pariharet \[? 'let
him avoid it (the term go in the sense of sacrifice), thinking that it
is too holy'\]. Sâya*n*a merely remarks, that both the cow and the
sacrifice are here represented as extremely auspicious (utk*ri*sh*t*am
pu*n*yam). Perhaps we have here a play on the words upanâma, 'a
by-name,' and upanâmuka, 'inclining to (him).' 'Go' (for go-sh*t*oma) is
the designation of one of the days of the Abhiplava at the Gavâmayana.
