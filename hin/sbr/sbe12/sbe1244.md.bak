### SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE OBLATIONS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:1">2:2:1:1</span></span>1. When
he has taken out the Âhavanîya fire <span
id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_690.md), he performs the Full-offering <span
id="fr_695"></span>[2](#fn_691.md). The reason why

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

he performs the full-offering is that he thereby causes that Agni to
become an eater of food for his own self; that he thereby offers food to
him. Even as (a mother or cow) would offer the breast to a new-born
child or calf, so does he thereby offer food to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:2">2:2:1:2</span></span>2. And
having been appeased by that food, he (Agni) waits patiently for the
other oblations to be cooked. If, on the other hand, that oblation were
not to be offered up in him, he would ere long burn either the Adhvaryu
or the sacrificer, for these two pass nearest by him. This is the reason
why he makes this offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:3">2:2:1:3</span></span>3. He
offers it (with a) full (spoon); for the full doubtless means the All
(universe), so that he thereby appeases him with the All. He offers it
with 'Svâhâ!' for the Svâhâ is undefined, and undefined also is the All,
so that he thereby appeases him by means of the All.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:4">2:2:1:4</span></span>4. The
first offering which Pra*g*âpati made, he made with 'Svâhâ!' Now that
(offering) indeed is virtually the same as this one; and hence he (the
sacrificer) also makes it with 'Svâhâ!' At this (offering) he grants a
boon (to the priests) <span id="fr_696"></span>[1](#fn_692.md); but

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

a boon (may mean) everything, so that he thereby appeases him (Agni)
with everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:5">2:2:1:5</span></span>5. Here
now they say, 'When he has made this offering, he need not attend to the
subsequent oblations; for by this offering he obtains that wish for
which he takes out the subsequent oblations.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:6">2:2:1:6</span></span>6. He
takes out (material for an oblation) <span
id="fr_697"></span>[1](#fn_693) to Agni Pavamâna (the Blowing.md) <span
id="fr_698"></span>[2](#fn_694.md). Now the blowing one is the breath, so
that he thereby puts breath into him (the sacrificer). And this he puts
into him by means of this (offering); for breath means food, and this
offering also is food.

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:7">2:2:1:7</span></span>7. He
then makes offering to Agni Pâvaka (the Purifying). Now the purifying
one means food, so that he thereby puts food into him (Agni, or the
sacrificer). And this he puts into him by means of this (offering), for
this offering is indeed food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:8">2:2:1:8</span></span>8. He
then makes offering to Agni *S*u*k*i (the Bright). Now brightness means
vigour, so that he thereby puts vigour into him. And this he puts into
him by means of this (offering); for when he offers up that oblation in
him (Agni), then that vigour, that brightness of his blazes up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:9">2:2:1:9</span></span>9. For
this reason they say, 'When he has made that (full) offering, he need
not attend to any further oblations; for by this offering he obtains
that wish for which he takes out the subsequent oblations.' But let him
nevertheless take out the subsequent oblations; for what invisible
(blessing, or meaning) there was in that (full-offering) that now
becomes thus (visible).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:10">2:2:1:10</span></span>10. Now
the reason why he makes offering to Agni Pavamâna, is that the blowing
one is the breath. When (the child) is born, then there is breath. And
as long as it is not born, it breathes in accord with the mother's
breath; but when it is born, then he thereby puts breath into it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:11">2:2:1:11</span></span>11. And
the reason why he makes offering to Agni Pâvaka, is that the purifying
one means food: hence he thereby puts food into (the child) when it is
born.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:12">2:2:1:12</span></span>12. And
the reason why he makes offering to Agni *S*u*k*i, is that brightness
means vigour. Now when it (the child) grows by means of food, then there
is vigour; and hence, when he has made it grow by means of food, he
thereby puts into it that vigour, that brightness. This is why (he
offers) to Agni *S*u*k*i.

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:13">2:2:1:13</span></span>13.
That other (practice) then is altogether erroneous <span
id="fr_699"></span>[1](#fn_695.md). For when Agni passed over from the gods
to men, he bethought him, 'I must not pass over to men with my whole
body!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:14">2:2:1:14</span></span>14. He
then laid down in these (three) worlds those three bodies of his. That
'blowing (pavamâna)' form of his he laid down on this earth, that
'purifying (pâvaka)' one in the ether, and that 'bright (*s*u*k*i)' one
in the sky. Now the *Ri*shis then existing became aware of this: 'Agni
has not come to us with his whole body,' they said. They then prepared
those oblations for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:15">2:2:1:15</span></span>15. Now
when he makes offering to Agni Pavamâna, he thereby obtains that form of
his (Agni's) which he laid down on this earth; and when he makes
offering to Agni Pâvaka, he thereby obtains that form of his which he
laid down in the ether; and when he makes offering to Agni *S*u*k*i, he
thereby obtains that form of his which he laid down in the sky: and thus
he lays down the entire Agni unmutilated. For this reason also he should
take out the oblations subsequent (to the full-offering).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:16">2:2:1:16</span></span>16. The
first oblation has a barhis (altar-covering of sacrificial grass) to
itself; the two following ones have one barhis in common. Now the first
oblation represents this world, the second one that ether, and the third
one the sky. But this earth is compact; and the ether and yonder sky
are, as it were, trembling: and in order that these two may
counterbalance that (earth), the (last) two (oblations) have one barhis
in common.

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:17">2:2:1:17</span></span>17. All
these sacrificial cakes (for Agni) are on eight potsherds; for of eight
syllables consists the (pâda of the) gâyatrî, and the gâyatrî is Agni's
metre <span id="fr_700"></span>[1](#fn_696.md): with its own metre he
accordingly establishes that fire. In all, these potsherds amount to
twenty-four; for of twenty-four syllables consists the gâyatrî (stanza),
and the gâyatrî is Agni's metre: with its own metre he accordingly
establishes that fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:18">2:2:1:18</span></span>18. He
then offers a potful of boiled rice to Aditi. For he who performs those
(preceding) oblations moves away, as it were, from this world, since he
moves in the ascent of these worlds <span
id="fr_701"></span>[2](#fn_697.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:19">2:2:1:19</span></span>19. Now
when he offers a potful of boiled rice to Aditi,--Aditi being this
earth, and this earth being a firm resting-place,--he thereby again
takes his stand on this firm resting-place. This is why he offers a
potful of boiled rice to Aditi.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:20">2:2:1:20</span></span>20. For
her, they say, the two sa*m*yâ*g*yâs <span
id="fr_702"></span>[3](#fn_698.md) should be virâ*g* verses; for the
virâ*g* is this (earth); or

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

trish*t*ubh verses, for the trish*t*ubh is this (earth); or *g*agatî
verses, for the *g*agatî is this (earth). Still, however, they should be
virâ*g* verses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:21">2:2:1:21</span></span>21. The
priests' fee for (offering to) her consists of a cow; for this (earth)
is, as it were, a cow: she milks out for men all their desires. The cow
is a mother, and this (earth) also is a mother, for she bears the men:
for this reason the priests' fee is a cow. This is one mode (of
performing those offerings).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:2:1:22">2:2:1:22</span></span>22.
Then there is this other. He simply offers a cake on eight potsherds to
Agni, and thereby, implicitly, to Agni Pavamâna, Agni Pâvaka, and Agni
*S*u*k*i; and immediately after he visibly sets him up (as Agni). For
this reason he offers (a cake) to Agni <span
id="fr_703"></span>[1](#fn_699.md), and then a potful of boiled rice to
Aditi. The treatment of the potful of rice (in that case) is the same
(as before).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_690"></span>[302:1](sbe1244.htm#fr_694.md) Previously to the
performance of the full-offering, the other fires (if there are any
more) are laid down. An integral part of the laying down of the Sabhya,
or hall-fire, which seems to have been kept up only by Kshatriyas, is a
game of dice, played by the priests, with a cow, offered by the
sacrificer, for the stake. On an ox-hide, spread north of the
sacrificial ground, they place a brass vessel upside down, and on it
throw four times five cowries (or, if such are not to be had, five
sticks) with 'Even I win, uneven thou art won (or defeated)!'

<span id="fn_691"></span>[302:2](sbe1244.htm#fr_695.md) The pûr*n*âhuti, or
'full-offering,' is an oblation of a spoonful of clarified butter. Kâty.
IV. 10, 5, and comm., supply the following particulars, applying to all
ordinary *g*uhoti-offerings: He puts butter into the butter-pot and
places it on the Gârhapatya to <span id="page_303">p. 303</span> melt.
Having then wiped the dipping-spoon (sruva) and offering-spoon (*g*uhû)
with sacrificial grass in the manner described at I, 3, 1, 6 seq., and
taken the butter-pot off the fire, and strained the butter with the two
stalks of darbha serving as strainers, he fills the *g*uhû with the
sruva. He now takes one stick, steps over to the north side of the
Âhavanîya fire, strews grass around it, and puts the stick on the fire.
He then sits down with bent right knee, and, while the sacrificer takes
hold of him from behind, he pours the spoonful of butter into the fire
with 'Svâhâ!' the sacrificer pronouncing the dedicatory formula (tyâga),
'This to Agni!'

<span id="fn_692"></span>[303:1](sbe1244.htm#fr_696.md) After the
full-offering the sacrificer breaks the silence, imposed on him, by the
words, 'I give a boon,' Kâty. IV, 10, 6; presents, <span
id="page_304">p. 304</span> according to the commentary, being then made
to the Adhvaryu and the Brahman. This ceremony is succeeded by the
silent performance of the Agnihotra.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[304:1](sbe1244.htm#fr_697.md) The pûr*n*âhuti,
which marks the close of the Agnyâdheya proper, is followed by the
Agnihotra, performed with the texts pronounced in a low voice. Not less
than twelve days after the Agnyâdheya (if at all)--the three fires being
kept up during the interval--the young householder has to get performed
for him (on the model of the new and full-moon offering, mutatis
mutandis, there being neither the uddhara*n*a, or taking out of fire
from the Gârhapatya, nor the choosing of a Brahman, &c.) the three
ish*t*is mentioned above. At the first ish*t*i, the special havis
(sacrificial dish) consists of a rice-cake on eight potsherds for Agni
Pavamâna;--at the second of two such cakes for Agni Pâvaka and Agni
Su*k*i respectively;--at the third of a potful of boiled rice for Aditi.
The three havis of the first two ish*t*is being (according to Taitt. Br.
I, 1, 6, 3) considered as representing the three bodies (tanu) of Agni;
these offerings are called tanûhavir-ish*t*is. They are, however, also
called Pavamânesh*t*is. At these the name of the recipient (Agni
Pavamâna, &c.) has to be pronounced in a low voice in the formulas used
at the chief offering. The Taitt. Br. mentions, besides, the usual
Indrâgni cake (of the new-moon sacrifice) which is to be offered before
the offering to Aditi.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[304:2](sbe1244.htm#fr_698.md) Sâya*n*a, on Taitt.
Br. I, 1, 5, 10, takes pavamâna as 'pure' or 'purified by himself'
(svaya*m* *s*riddha); pâvaka as 'purifying (others);' and *s*u*k*i as
'shining.'

<span id="fn_695"></span>[306:1](sbe1244.htm#fr_699.md) Viz. the practice
of performing the full-offering only, see par. 5. The Kâ*n*va text
reads: Tad vâ etat samânam eva sad viparyastam iva.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[307:1](sbe1244.htm#fr_700.md) The Kâ*n*va text
remarks that the anuvâkyâs (invitatory prayers) and yâ*g*yâs (offering
prayers) at the three offerings of cake are in the gâyatrî metre; and
such indeed is the case. The anuvâkyâs of the oblations to Agni
Pavamâna, Agni Pâvaka, and Agni *S*u*k*i are Rig-veda IX, 66, 19; I, 12,
10; and VIII, 44, 21 respectively: and the yâ*g*yâs are IX, 66, 21; V,
26, 1; and VIII, 44, 17 respectively; all of which are gâyatrî stanzas.
See Â*s*v. *S*r. II, 1, 20-25. Cf. also I, 7, 2, 15, with note. At the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t of these two ish*t*is also both formulas are in the
gâyatrî metre: the puro’nuvâkyâs being Rig-veda III, 11, 2, and III, 11,
6; and the yâ*g*yâs III, 11, 1, and I, 1, 1 respectively.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[307:2](sbe1244.htm#fr_701.md) Pra*k*yavata iva vâ
esho ’smâl lokât . . . imân hi lokân samârohann eti. The Kâ*n*va text
has: 'For he who takes out these oblations makes his self, as it were,
depart from this world of men for the world of the gods, since he, as it
were, moves rising upwards (ûrdhva iva hi samârohann eti).' Cf.
paragraphs 14-16.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[307:3](sbe1244.htm#fr_702) For these (virâ*g*.md)
sa*m*yâ*g*ye, or invitatory and offering prayers at the Svish*t*ak*ri*t,
see [p. 164](sbe1227.htm#page_164.md), note
[2](sbe1228.htm#fn_381.md).--Â*s*v. *S*r. II, 1, 29.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[308:1](sbe1244.htm#fr_703.md) According to the
Kâ*n*va recension, the anuvâkyâ and yâ*g*yâ, in that case, should
consist of the verses containing the word mûrdhan ('head'), viz. Vâ*g*.
S. XIII, 14, 15; cf. *S*at. Br. I, 6, 2, 12.
