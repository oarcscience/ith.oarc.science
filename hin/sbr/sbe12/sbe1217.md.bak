### FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:1">1:4:1:1</span></span>1. He
recites after uttering (the syllable) 'Hiṅ!' Sacrifice, they say, is not
(performed) without the Sâman; and neither is the Sâman chanted without
'Hiṅ' having been uttered. By his uttering 'Hiṅ!' the peculiar nature
(rûpam) of the word 'Hiṅ' is produced (in the sacrifice); and by the
sacred syllable (om) it assumes the nature of the Sâman. By uttering
'Om! Om <span id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_275.md)!' this his entire
sacrifice becomes endowed with the Sâman.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:2">1:4:1:2</span></span>2. And
(another reason) why he utters 'Hiṅ!' is this. The word 'Hiṅ' means
breath, for the word Hiṅ' does indeed mean breath: he cannot therefore
pronounce the word 'Hiṅ,' when he closes his nostrils. The *rik* (verse)
he recites with his voice. Now, voice and breath are a pair, so that a
productive union of the sâmidhenîs is thereby effected at the outset:
for this reason he recites, after uttering 'Hiṅ!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:3">1:4:1:3</span></span>3. He
utters the word 'Hiṅ' in a low voice. Were he, on the contrary, to
pronounce 'Hiṅ' aloud, he would make 'voice' of both the one and the
other: for this reason he utters the word 'Hiṅ' in a low voice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:4">1:4:1:4</span></span>4. He
recites with 'â (hither)!' and 'pra (forth or thither) <span
id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_276.md)!' He thereby joins a gâyatrî verse
directed hitherward to one directed away from here: the one which tends
from hence carries the sacrifice to the gods, and the one which tends
hitherward pleases the men. For this reason he recites with 'â' and
'pra.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:5">1:4:1:5</span></span>5. And
(another reason) why he recites with 'â' and 'pra,' is this. 'Pra
(forth)' clearly means out-breathing, and 'â (hither)' means
in-breathing: hence he thereby obtains out-breathing and in-breathing
(for the sacrificer). For this reason he recites with 'â' and 'pra.'

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:6">1:4:1:6</span></span>6. Yet
(other reasons) why he recites with 'hither (â)' and 'thither (pra),'
are these. 'Thither' the seed is cast, and 'hither' birth takes place.
'Thither' the cattle disperse (for grazing), 'hither' they return.
Indeed, everything here (moves) 'hither' and 'thither:' for this reason
he recites with 'â' and 'pra.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:7">1:4:1:7</span></span>7. He
recites <span id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_277.md), 'Forth go your viands,
heavenward!'--

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

hereby, then, the 'thither' is (realised). And (in the second verse),
'Come hither, Agni, to expand <span
id="fr_279"></span>[1](#fn_278.md)!'--by this, on the other hand, the
'hither' is (realised).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:8">1:4:1:8</span></span>8. Now,
in reference to this point, some people say, 'Both these (texts) surely
result in a "thither <span id="fr_280"></span>[2](#fn_279.md)."' This,
however, is beyond the ordinary understanding: the text, 'forth go your
viands, heavenward!' is clearly (directed) away from (the sacrificer);
and the text, 'Come hither, Agni, to expand!' is (directed) towards
(him).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:9">1:4:1:9</span></span>9. He
recites (the first kindling verse), 'Forth go your viands, heavenward!'
this, then, tends in a forward direction. 'Viands' (vâ*g*a) <span
id="fr_281"></span>[3](#fn_280.md) he says, because viands mean food: hence
food is obtained (for the sacrificer) by this recitation. 'Heavenward'
he says, because those that tend heavenward are the half-moons:

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

it is, therefore, the half-moons which he obtains by this recitation.
'In havis rich' he further says, because those that are rich in havis
(milk, butter) are the cattle; it is cattle, therefore, that he thereby
obtains through the recitation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:10">1:4:1:10</span></span>10.
'With buttered (spoon)--' he adds. Now Mâthava, the (king of)
Videgha <span id="fr_282"></span>[1](#fn_281.md), carried Agni Vai*s*vânara
in his mouth. The *Ri*shi Gotama Râhûga*n*a was his family priest. When
addressed (by the latter), he made no answer to him, fearing lest Agni
might fall from his mouth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:11">1:4:1:11</span></span>11. He
(the priest) began to invoke the latter with

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

verses of the Rig-veda, 'We kindle thee at the sacrifice, O wise Agni,
thee the radiant, the mighty caller to the sacrificial feast (Rig-veda
V, 26, 3)!--O Videgha!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:12">1:4:1:12</span></span>12. He
(the king) did not answer. (The priest went on), 'Upwards, O Agni, dart
thy brilliant, shining rays, thy flames, thy beams (Rig-veda VIII, 44,
16)!--O Videgha-a-a!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:13">1:4:1:13</span></span>13.
Still he did not answer. (The priest continued), 'Thee, O
butter-sprinkled one, we invoke! (Rig-veda V, 26, 2);' so much he
uttered, when at the very mentioning of butter, Agni Vai*s*vânara
flashed forth from the (king's) mouth: he was unable to hold him back;
he issued from his mouth, and fell down on this earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:14">1:4:1:14</span></span>14.
Mâthava, the Videgha, was at that time on the (river) Sarasvatî <span
id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_282). He (Agni.md) thence went burning along
this earth towards the east; and Gotama Râhûga*n*a and the Videgha
Mâthava followed after him as he was burning along. He burnt over (dried
up) all these rivers. Now that (river), which is called 'Sadânîrâ,'
flows from the northern (Himâlaya) mountain: that one he did not burn
over. That one the Brâhmans did not cross in former times, thinking, 'it
has not been burnt over by Agni Vai*s*vânara.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:15">1:4:1:15</span></span>15.
Now-a-days, however, there are many Brâhmans to the east of it. At that
time it (the land east of the Sadânîrâ) was very uncultivated, very
marshy, because it had not been tasted by Agni Vai*s*vânara.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:16">1:4:1:16</span></span>16.
Now-a-days, however, it is very cultivated, for the Brâhmans have caused
(Agni) to taste it through

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

sacrifices. Even in late summer that (river), as it were, rages
along <span id="fr_284"></span>[1](#fn_283.md): so cold is it, not having
been burnt over by Agni Vai*s*vânara.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:17">1:4:1:17</span></span>17.
Mâthava, the Videgha, then said (to Agni), 'Where am I to abide?' 'To
the east of this (river) be thy abode!' said he. Even now this (river)
forms the boundary of the Kosalas and Videhas; for these are the
Mâthavas (or descendants of Mâthava).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:18">1:4:1:18</span></span>18.
Gotama Râhûga*n*a then said (to Mâthava), 'Why didst thou not answer
when addressed by us?' He replied, 'Agni Vai*s*vânara was in my mouth; I
did not reply, lest he should escape from my mouth.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:19">1:4:1:19</span></span>19.
'How then did this happen?'--'At the moment when thou didst utter the
words, "(Thee), O butter-sprinkled one, we invoke!" just then, at the
mention of butter, Agni Vai*s*vânara flashed forth from my mouth; I was
unable to hold him back, he issued from my mouth.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:20">1:4:1:20</span></span>20.
That (word) in the sâmidhenîs, therefore, which contains butter
(gh*ri*ta) is especially suitable for kindling (sam-indh); and by it he
accordingly kindles him (Agni, the fire) and bestows vigour on this
(sacrificer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:21">1:4:1:21</span></span>21. Now
that (word) is gh*ri*tâ*k*yâ, 'with the buttered (spoon).'--'He
nears <span id="fr_285"></span>[2](#fn_284.md) the gods, wishful of bliss.'
Wishful of bliss, truly, is the sacrificer, since he wishes to approach
the gods, to go to <span id="fr_286"></span>[3](#fn_285.md)

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

the gods: therefore he says, 'he nears the gods, wishful of bliss.' This
(verse), which is addressed to Agni, is undefined (vague); and
undefined, doubtless, is the 'All;' he thus commences (this holy work)
with the All.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:22">1:4:1:22</span></span>22.
\[He recites the second sâmidhenî\]: 'Come hither, Agni, to
expand!'--'To expand' he says, because at the beginning these worlds
were well-nigh contiguous to one another: at that time one could touch
the sky thus <span id="fr_287"></span>[1](#fn_286.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:23">1:4:1:23</span></span>23. The
gods desired, 'How could these worlds of ours become farther apart from
one another? How could there be more space for us?' They breathed
through them (the worlds) with these three syllables (forming the word)
'vîtaye <span id="fr_288"></span>[2](#fn_287.md),' and these worlds became
far apart from one another; and there was then ampler space for the
gods: ample space, therefore, he will have for whom, knowing this, they
recite this (verse) containing (the word) 'vîtaye.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:24">1:4:1:24</span></span>24. He
proceeds, 'Invoked for the giver of oblations!' 'The giver of
oblations <span id="fr_289"></span>[3](#fn_288.md),' of course, is the

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

sacrificer: hence 'invoked for the sacrificer' is what he thereby means
to say.--'As Hot*ri* on the barhis sit!' Agni, indeed, is the Hot*ri*,
and the barhis (the covering of sacrificial grass on the altar) is this
world: hence he thereby establishes Agni (the fire) in this world, as
this fire is established (or, beneficial, hita) in this world. This
(verse), then, is recited with reference to this world (the earth):
through it this world is conquered by him for whom, knowing this, they
recite this (verse).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:25">1:4:1:25</span></span>25.
\[He recites the third sâmidhenî\]: 'With samidhs thee, O
Aṅgiras!'--with samidhs (kindling-sticks), indeed, the Aṅgiras kindled
him. 'O Aṅgiras!' he says, for Agni is indeed Aṅgiras <span
id="fr_290"></span>[1](#fn_289.md).--'With butter we exhilarate!' This
(viz. gh*ri*tena, 'with butter') is a word which is especially suitable
for the kindling of Agni: by it he kindles him, and bestows vigour on
this (sacrificer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:26">1:4:1:26</span></span>26.
'Shine forth, O youngest, brilliantly!' he adds; for brilliantly he
shines, when kindled; and 'O youngest!' he says, because he is really
the youngest Agni <span id="fr_291"></span>[2](#fn_290.md): therefore he
says, 'O youngest!' This (verse) is recited with reference to yonder
world, to wit, the aërial world; hence this (verse), which is addressed
to Agni, is undefined, for undefined is yonder world: that world he
thereby gains, for whom, knowing this, they recite this verse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:27">1:4:1:27</span></span>27.
\[He recites the fourth sâmidhenî\]: 'Agni, do thou obtain for us that
(region) wide and

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

glorious!' For wide, indeed, is yonder (region) wherein the gods
(dwell), and glorious is that (region) wherein the gods (dwell). When he
says, 'Do thou obtain for us <span id="fr_292"></span>[1](#fn_291.md),' he
means to say, 'make us go to it!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:28">1:4:1:28</span></span>28.
'That great and mighty one, O God!' For great, indeed, is yonder
(region) wherein the gods (dwell), and mighty <span
id="fr_293"></span>[2](#fn_292) is that wherein the gods (dwell.md). This
(verse), then, is recited with reference to yonder world: that heavenly
world he thereby gains, for whom, knowing this, they recite this
(verse).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:29">1:4:1:29</span></span>29. He
recites (the fifth sâmidhenî): 'Praiseworthy he, adorable,' for worthy
of praise he is, and worthy of adoration;--'visible through the veil of
gloom,' for when kindled he is seen right through the gloom;--'Agni, the
mighty one (bull), is lit,' for he is indeed lit up, the mighty one.

\[He recites the sixth sâmidhenî\]: 'The mighty Agni is lit up,' for he
is indeed lit up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:30">1:4:1:30</span></span>30.
'Yea <span id="fr_294"></span>[3](#fn_293.md), as a horse that bears the
gods,' for having become a horse he does indeed carry the sacrifice to
the gods: the (word) 'na' which occurs in this verse has the meaning of
'om' (verily); hence he says, 'Yea, as a horse that bears to the gods.'

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:31">1:4:1:31</span></span>31.
'With offerings him they glorify,' for with offerings men indeed glorify
him; therefore he says, 'with offerings him they glorify.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:32">1:4:1:32</span></span>32.
\[He recites the seventh sâmidhenî): 'O mighty one <span
id="fr_295"></span>[1](#fn_294.md)! we mighty men do kindle thee, the
mighty one!' for they indeed kindle him;--'O Agni, thee that brightly
shines!' for he indeed shone brightly when he was kindled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:33">1:4:1:33</span></span>33. He
recites this tristich which contains the word (v*ri*shan), 'mighty.' All
these kindling verses, it is true, are addressed to Agni; Indra,
however, is the deity of sacrifice, Indra is the mighty (hero); hence
these his (the sacrificer's) kindling verses thereby become possessed of
Indra: this is the reason why he recites the tristich containing the
word 'mighty.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:34">1:4:1:34</span></span>34. He
recites \[the eighth sâmidhenî\]: 'Agni we choose as messenger!' Now the
gods and the Asuras, both of them sprang from Pra*g*âpati, were
contending for superiority. When they were thus contending, the gâyatrî
stood between them. That gâyatrî was the same as this earth, and this
earth indeed lay between them <span id="fr_296"></span>[2](#fn_295.md). Now
both of them knew that whichever she would side with, they would be
victorious and the others would be defeated. Both parties then invited
her secretly to come to them. Agni acted as messenger for the gods; and
an Asura-Rakshas, named

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Saharakshas <span
id="fr_297"></span>[1](#fn_296.md), for the Asuras. She then followed Agni:
he therefore recites, 'Agni we choose for messenger,' because he was the
messenger of the gods.--'As Hot*ri* the all-knowing, him!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:35">1:4:1:35</span></span>35.
Here now some people recite, 'He who is the Hot*ri* of the
all-knowing <span id="fr_298"></span>[2](#fn_297.md);' lest (in saying 'for
Hot*ri*, the all-knowing, him') one should say to oneself 'enough (i.e.
have done)!' This, however, he should not do; for by (doing) so they do
at the sacrifice what is human; and what is human, is inauspicious at a
sacrifice. Therefore, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the
sacrifice, he should recite, just as it is recited by the *Ri*k, 'for
Hot*ri*, the all-knowing, him!' \[He continues\], 'Performing well this
sacrifice!' for he, Agni, is indeed a good performer of the sacrifice:
for this reason he says, 'performing well this sacrifice.' She (gâyatrî,
or the earth) sided with the gods, and the gods thereupon were
victorious and the Asuras were defeated: and verily he for whom, knowing
this, they recite this (verse), is himself victorious and his
adversaries are defeated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:36">1:4:1:36</span></span>36. He
therefore recites this, the eighth sâmidhenî). This, indeed, is
peculiarly a gâyatrî verse, since it is of eight syllables that the
gâyatrî (metre) consists: for this reason he recites the eighth
(sâmidhenî).

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:37">1:4:1:37</span></span>37.
Here now some people place the two (dhâyyâs) additional kindling verses
before (the eighth sâmidhenî), arguing, 'The two dhâyyâs <span
id="fr_299"></span>[1](#fn_298.md) mean food: this edible food we place in
front (or, in the mouth, mukhata*h*).' But let him not do this: for with
him who inserts the additional verses before (the eighth), the latter
(the eighth) is clearly out of its place <span
id="fr_300"></span>[2](#fn_299.md), since in that case it (and the
succeeding verse) become the tenth and eleventh verses. With him, on the
other hand, for whom they recite this as the eighth (kindling verse), it
is indeed in its proper place: let him therefore insert the two
additional verses after (the ninth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:38">1:4:1:38</span></span>38.
\[He recites the ninth kindling verse\]: 'He who is kindled at the
cult'--the cult (adhvara), doubtless, is the sacrifice: 'he who is
kindled at the sacrifice' he thereby says;--'Agni, the bright, the
laudable,' for he is both bright and laudable;--'the flaming-locked, him
we adore!' for when he is kindled, his locks, as it were, flame.
Previously to (the beginning of the tenth verse), 'O Agni, worshipped,
thou art lit!' let him (the Adhvaryu) put on

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

all the kindling-sticks with the exception of the one stick (which is to
be put on at the after-offerings <span id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_300).md);
for it is now that the Hot*ri* completes (the kindling); and what then
is left of the kindling-sticks, other than the one stick, that is left
(unused altogether); and what is left (unused) of the sacrifice, that is
left for his (the sacrificer's) spiteful enemy: let him, therefore,
previously to this (verse), put on all the samidhs, save one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:1:39">1:4:1:39</span></span>39.
\[He continues\]: 'Adore, good worshipper, the gods!' worship (adhvara)
doubtless means sacrifice: 'adore the gods, good sacrificer,' he thereby
says;--'Oblation-bearer, sure, art thou!' for he, Agni, is indeed the
bearer of oblations: for this reason he says 'oblation-bearer, sure, art
thou.'

\[He recites the last sâmidhenî\]: 'Make offerings! do reverence! Him,
Agni, while the cult proceeds, for your oblation-bearer choose!' by this
(verse) he urges them on: 'make offerings and worship! do this for (the
accomplishment) of whatever desire you kindled him!' this is what he
thereby means to say. 'Him, Agni, while the cult proceeds,' he says,
because cult means sacrifice: hence he thereby says, 'him, Agni, whilst
the sacrifice proceeds;'--'for your oblation-bearer choose!' for he,
Agni, is indeed the oblation-bearer, and for this reason he says 'for
your oblation-bearer choose (him)!'

40\. This tristich, containing (the word) 'cult (adhvara),' he thus
recites. For once when the gods were engaged in sacrificing, their
rivals, the Asuras, wished to injure (dhurv, dhvar) them; but, though
desirous of injuring them, they were

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

unable to injure them and were foiled: for this reason the sacrifice is
called adhvara ('not damaged, uninterrupted'); and for whomsoever, that
knows this, they recite this tristich containing (the word) adhvara
('cult, sacrifice'), his rival, though desirous of injuring him, is
foiled; and he, (the sacrificer), moreover, gains as much as one gains
by offering a Soma-sacrifice <span id="fr_302"></span>[1](#fn_301.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_275"></span>[100:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_276.md) That is, by
uttering 'Om!' after each verse. The recitation of the first verse is
preceded by the mystic words 'Hiṅ bhûr bhuva*h* svar om!' Â*s*v. *S*. I,
2, 3. Both syllables 'hiṅ' and 'om' are essential elements in the
recitation of Sâman hymns, See II, 2, 4, 11 seq.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[101:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_277.md) The particles pra
and â were apparently used in phrases wishing one a safe journey and
return (cf. Ait. Br. 3, 26, with Haug's note). The first sâmidhenî
begins, 'prá vo vâ´gâ abhídyava*h*' (forth go your viands, heavenward);
and the second 'ágna â´ yâhi vîtáye' (come hither, Agni, to the feast!).
It is from these verses that the above symbolical explanation is
derived. Cf. Taitt. S. II, 5, 7, 3 \[prâ*k*îna*m* reto
dhîyate--pratî*k*î*h* pra*g*â *g*âyante\].

<span id="fn_277"></span>[102:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_278.md) The following is a
connected translation (as literal as possible, if not elegant) of the
eleven sâmidhenîs, or kindling verses, in the same octosyllabic metre as
the original. The first and eleventh verses are recited three times; and
when at the end of each verse the Hot*ri* pronounces the syllable o*m*,
the Adhvaryu throws a stick (samidh) into the fire,--up to the eighth
verse, at the end of which the tenth stick is thrown in. At the end of
the ninth verse five of the remaining six sticks are thrown into the
fire. The throwing of the first stick is accompanied by the sacrificer
pronouncing the dedicatory formula (tyâga), 'For Agni this, not for me!'

1\. Forth go your viands, heavenward,  
In havis rich; with buttered (spoon)  
He nears the gods, wishful of bliss.

2\. Come hither, Agni, to the feast;  
Invokéd for the offering-gift,  
As Hot*ri* on the barhis sit!

3\. With samidhs thee, O Aṅgiras,  
With butter we exhilarate:  
Shine forth, O youngest, brilliantly!

4\. Agni, do thou obtain for us  
That region wide and glorious,  
That great and mighty one, O God!

5\. Praiseworthy he, adorable,  
Visible through the veil of gloom,  
Agni, the mighty one, is lit.

6\. The mighty Agni is lit up,  
Yea, as a horse that bears the gods:  
With offerings him they glorify.

7\. O mighty one! we mighty men  
Do kindle thee, the mighty one,--  
O Agni, thee that brightly shines. <span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

8\. Agni we choose as messenger,  
As Hot*ri* the all-knowing,--him,  
Performing well this sacrifice.

9\. He who is kindled at the cult,  
Agni, the bright, the laudable,  
The flaming-locked, him we adore.

10\. O Agni, worshipped, thou art lit:  
Adore, good worshipper, the gods!  
Oblation-bearer, sure, art thou.

11\. Make offerings! do reverence!--  
Him, Agni, while the cult proceeds,  
For your oblation-bearer choose!

<span id="fn_279"></span>[103:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_280.md) Inasmuch as Agni,
whilst coming to the sacrifice, goes away from the gods. Sây.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[103:3](sbe1217.htm#fr_281.md) In the Taitt. S.
II, 5, 7, 3-4 also vâ*g*a is in the first place rendered by 'food,'
while afterwards it is identified with the months (i.e. the coursers?
gamana*s*îla, Sây.); as abhidyava*h* (in the sense of 'shining in both
directions,' i.e. in the form of the waxing and waning moon, Sây.) is
referred to the half-moons.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[104:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_282.md) To this important
legend attention was first drawn by Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. I, 170
seq. (cf. also Ind. Streifen, I, p. 13; J. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, II, p.
402). It was pointed out by Weber that this legend distinguishes three
successive stages of the eastward migration of the Brâhmanical Hindus.
In the first place the settlements of the Âryans had already been
extended from the Pa*ñg*ab (where they were settled in the times of the
hymns of the Rig-veda) as far as the Sarasvatî. They thence pushed
forward, led by the Videgha Mâthava and his priest, according to our
legend, as far east as the river Sadânîrâ (that is, 'she that is always
filled with water'), which, according to Sâya*n*a, is another name for
the Karatoyâ (the modern Kurattee, on which Bograh lies), which formed
the eastern boundary of the Videhas; or more probably the Ga*nd*akî (the
modern Gunduck, a noble river which falls into the Ganges opposite
Patna, and) which formed the boundary between the Kosalas and the
Videhas (cf. par. 17). It would appear from our legend, that for some
time the Aryans did not venture to cross this river; but at the time of
the author the country to the east of it had long been occupied by them.
Sâya*n*a takes the hero of the legend to be Videgha, the Mâdhava or son
of Madhu; but Videgha, an older form of Videha, is more probably
intended here (as Weber takes it) for the name of that people and
country (corresponding to the modern Tirhut). The Agni Vai*s*vânara (or
Agni who is common to all men) of our legend Professor Weber considers a
personification of Brâhmanical worship and civilisation and the
destructive effects of their extension.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[105:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_283.md) Or, according to
Sâya*n*a, he was then in the Sarasvatî, plunged into the river in order
to quench the heat produced by Agni.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[106:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_284.md) That is to say, it
is not affected by the heat of the summer, as the other rivers, but
rushes along as rapidly and as well-filled as ever.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[106:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_285.md) *G*igâti is taken
by Sâya*n*a in the sense of 'he sings, praises.' Our author, on the
other hand, seems to interpret it by 'he conquers (*g*i);' see, however,
next note.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[106:3](sbe1217.htm#fr_286.md) The text has, 'Sa
hi devân *g*igîshati sa hi devân *g*igâ*m*sati.' The Kâ*n*va recension
has the same reading, except that it omits 'hi' <span id="page_107">p.
107</span> in both cases. Instead of *g*igâ*m*sati, however, some MSS.,
as well as Sâya*n*a, read *g*ighâ*m*sati ('he wishes to conquer, or
beat, the gods'), probably an old corruption, easily accounted for by
the circumstance that *g*igishati is the regular desiderative of *g*i,
'to conquer,' though it also occurs in some passages as the desiderative
of gâ, 'to go.' Sâya*n*a, however, though he reads *g*ighâ*m*sati, here
allows to the root han (with Naigh. 2, 14) the meaning of 'to go.' Cf.
Weber, Omina and Portenta, p. 406, note 4.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[107:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_287.md) Viz. by stretching
the arms upwards. Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[107:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_288.md) That is, vi-itaye,
'for going asunder,' a fanciful analysis of the word vîti; the correct
rendering is 'for the meal or food,' 'for the feast.'

<span id="fn_288"></span>[107:3](sbe1217.htm#fr_289.md) Havyadâti, the
correct meaning of the word is 'the giving of oblations.'

<span id="fn_289"></span>[108:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_290.md) Rig-veda I, 31, 1,
he is called the first of the Aṅgiras.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[108:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_291.md) The fire which has
just been kindled is frequently called the youngest (yavish*th*a).
Sâya*n*a takes it as 'the ever young.' See also the legend regarding the
three Agnis who preceded the present Agni in the office of divine
Hot*ri*, I, 2, 3, 1; 3, 3, 13.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[109:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_292.md) Vivâsasi, Sâya*n*a
explains it by prakâsaya, 'illuminate it;' but cf. Sâya*n*a on Rig-veda
VI, 16, asmân a*kkh*a abhigamaya, 'make it (dhanam) come to us.'

<span id="fn_292"></span>[109:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_293.md) Suvîrya is taken by
our author as an adjective, co-ordinate with the others; but it is
evidently a noun ('abundance of heroes' or 'manliness, manly power,' St.
Petersburg Dictionary) qualified by the adjectives.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[109:3](sbe1217.htm#fr_294.md) Na is taken by our
author as a particle of asseveration; though in reality it is a particle
of comparison. In later Sanskrit na is only used as particle of
negation.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[110:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_295.md) V*ri*shan, 'the
male, the vigorous one, the bull;' cf. Max Müller, Translation of
Rig-veda Sanhitâ, I, p. 121 seq.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[110:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_296.md) 'On the top of
Mount Meru lies the city of Amarâvatî, wherein the gods dwell; and
beneath Meru lies Irâvatî, the city of the Asuras: between these two
lies the earth.' Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[111:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_297.md) Cf. the
corresponding passage in Taitt. S. II, 5, 11, 8, where Daivya is given
as the name of the messenger of the Asuras.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[111:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_298.md) That is to say,
instead of 'Hotâra*m* vi*s*vavedasam,' they recite 'Hotâ yo
vi*s*vavedasa*h*;' for the reason that Hotâram (accusative of hot*ri*)
might be understood to be 'hotâ aram,' aram, 'enough,' being a particle
implying a prohibition. Our author, however, promptly sets his face
against this application of human reasoning to an inspired text.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[112:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_299.md) Whenever thirteen
kindling verses are recited instead of eleven (or counting the
repetitions of the first and last verses, seventeen instead of fifteen),
the two verses Rig-veda III, 27, 5 and 6 are inserted according to our
author after the ninth, and according to others before the eighth,
sâmidhenî. They are called dhâyyâ, probably derived from dhâ, 'to put,
add,' whilst those ritualists whose practice is here rejected apparently
connect the word with the root dhâ (dhe), 'to suck.'

<span id="fn_299"></span>[112:2](sbe1217.htm#fr_300.md) According to
Sâya*n*a, because it no longer occupies the eighth place for which it is
specially appropriate on account of its being, according to our author,
'peculiarly a gâyatrî (eight-syllabled) verse.' This reasoning is far
from satisfactory, since the two dhâyyâs (Rig-veda III, 27, 5 and 6) are
also gâyatrî verses.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[113:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_301.md) See I, 8, 2, 3.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[114:1](sbe1217.htm#fr_302.md) Saumya adhvara is
the common designation of the solemn Soma-sacrifice; hence, our author
argues, the word adhvara is here used for sacrifice (ya*gñ*a) with a
view to insure to this offering the efficacy of a Soma-sacrifice.
