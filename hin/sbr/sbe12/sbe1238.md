### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE PATNÎSA*M*YÂ*G*AS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:1">1:9:2:1</span></span>1. Being
about to perform the patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as <span
id="fr_602"></span>[1](#fn_598), they betake themselves back to the
Gârhapatya fire. The Adhvaryu takes the *g*uhû and sruva, the Hot*ri*
the veda, and the Âgnîdhra the butter-(melting) pot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:2">1:9:2:2</span></span>2. Here
now the Adhvaryu, according to some, passes the Âhavanîya on the east
side. Let him not, however, do this; for were he to walk on that side,
he would be outside the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:3">1:9:2:3</span></span>3.
According to others, the Adhvaryu walks (so as to pass) behind the
(sacrificer's) wife <span id="fr_603"></span>[2](#fn_599). Let him not,
however, do this either; for verily the Adhvaryu is the fore-part, and
the wife is the hind-part of the sacrifice: hence, if he were to pass
so, it would be as if one were to put his head behind; and he (the
Adhvaryu) would be outside the sacrifice.

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:4">1:9:2:4</span></span>4.
According to others, the Adhvaryu passes between the wife (and the
Gârhapatya fire). Let him not, however, do this either; for were he to
pass that way, he would cut off the wife from the sacrifice. Along the
east side of the Gârhapatya and the inner side of the Âhavanîya (he
passes); for thus he is not outside the sacrifice; and as before, in
walking forward (to the Âhavanîya), he passed along the inner side, so
he now also takes that path.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:5">1:9:2:5</span></span>5. They
now perform the patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as. From the sacrifice offspring is
assuredly produced; and (that offspring) produced from the sacrifice is
produced from union; and (the offspring) produced from union is produced
after (in consequence of) the completion <span
id="fr_604"></span>[1](#fn_600) of the sacrifice: hence one thereby
(i.e. by the patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as) causes that (offspring) to be produced
by means of a productive union after the completion of the sacrifice.
And so now also offspring is produced by means of a productive union
after the completion of the sacrifice. This is why they now perform the
patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:6">1:9:2:6</span></span>6. He
makes offering to four deities. Four doubtless means a couple; for a
couple means a pair (dvandva, lit. two and two), and two and two indeed
they are: thus a productive union is thereby effected; and accordingly
he makes offering to four deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:7">1:9:2:7</span></span>7. He
makes (the offerings) of butter for sacrificial food. Butter indeed
means seed: hence he thereby scatters seed, and therefore makes them of
butter for sacrificial food.

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:8">1:9:2:8</span></span>8. In a
low voice they engage in this (performance) <span
id="fr_605"></span>[1](#fn_601). Secretly, doubtless, union takes place;
and secretly also (takes place) what (is spoken) in a low voice: this is
why they perform in a low voice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:9">1:9:2:9</span></span>9. He
first makes offering to Soma. Soma indeed means seed; hence he thereby
scatters seed: this is why he makes offering to Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:10">1:9:2:10</span></span>10. He
then makes offering to Tvash*tri*. Now, it is Tvash*tri* who transforms
seed which is scattered. Accordingly it is he who transforms the seed
now scattered <span id="fr_606"></span>[2](#fn_602): this is why he
makes offering to Tvash*tri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:11">1:9:2:11</span></span>11. He
then makes offering to the wives of the gods. In the wives, in the womb,
the seed assuredly is planted, and thence it is produced; hence he
thereby plants the seed in the wives, in the womb; and thence it is
produced: for this reason he makes offering to the wives of the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:12">1:9:2:12</span></span>12.
When he offers to the wives of the gods, he shuts (the fire) out from
view on the eastern side; for, up to the time when they offer to the
samish*t*aya*g*us, the deities continue waiting, thinking, 'This

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

he must offer up to us!' He thereby conceals (this offering) from them;
and accordingly Yâ*gñ*avalkya says, 'Whenever human women here eat <span
id="fr_607"></span>[1](#fn_603) (they do so) apart from men.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:13">1:9:2:13</span></span>13. He
then makes offering to Agni, the householder. Agni, indeed, is this
world: hence it is for this world that he thereby produces offspring and
that this offspring is produced: this is why he makes offering to Agni,
the householder.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:14">1:9:2:14</span></span>14.
This (ceremony) concludes with the i*d*â <span
id="fr_608"></span>[2](#fn_604); for here are neither enclosing-sticks
nor the prastara-bunch. For on that occasion when he wishes the
sacrificer good-speed (svagâ) <span id="fr_609"></span>[3](#fn_605) by
(offering) the prastara, good-speed is at the same time wished to his
consort also, since the wife comes (immediately) after the husband. But
were he to use a substitute for the prastara-bunch, he would produce
lassitude (in the wife): for this reason this (ceremony) should conclude
with the i*d*â. Nevertheless a substitute for the prastara is
(optionally) made.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:15">1:9:2:15</span></span>15. If
he choose to use a substitute for the prastara, he thereby wishes the
wife good-speed just as

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

he wishes the sacrificer good-speed by means of the prastara.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:16">1:9:2:16</span></span>16. If
he choose to use a substitute for the prastara, he plucks out one stalk
from the veda, and anoints its top in the *g*uhû, its middle part in the
aruva, and its lower end in the butter-pan.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:17">1:9:2:17</span></span>17. The
Âgnîdhra then says, 'Throw (it) after <span
id="fr_610"></span>[1](#fn_606)!' \[The Adhvaryu\] having thrown it
silently after (the prastara into the fire), touches himself, with the
text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 16 f), 'Guardian of the eye art thou, O Agni, guard
mine eye!' and in this way he avoids throwing himself after (the
prastara into the fire).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:18">1:9:2:18</span></span>18. He
(the Âgnîdhra) then says (to the Adhvaryu), 'Discourse together!' (The
Adhvaryu says), 'Has he gone (to the gods), Agnîdh?' 'He has gone!' 'Bid
(the gods) hear!' 'May (one or they) hear!' 'Good-speed to the divine
Hot*ri*s! Success to the human!' \[Then the Adhvaryu to the Hot*ri*\],
'Pronounce the "All-hail and blessing!"'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:19">1:9:2:19</span></span>19.
Thereupon <span id="fr_611"></span>[2](#fn_607) he (the Adhvaryu) seizes
at the same time the *g*uhû and sruva. On the former occasion <span
id="fr_612"></span>[3](#fn_608) indeed, by anointing (the prastara), he

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

made (the sacrificer) an oblation, thus thinking, 'May he go to the
world of the gods as an oblation!' For this reason he now seizes the
*g*uhû and sruva at the same time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:20">1:9:2:20</span></span>20. He
seizes them for Agni, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 20 a), 'O Agni,
unimpaired in vigour, far-reacher!' because Agni is immortal, he says,
unimpaired in vigour:' and because Agni is farthest-reaching, he says,
'far-reacher <span id="fr_613"></span>[1](#fn_609).'--'Guard me from the
thunderbolt! guard me from bonds! guard me from defective sacrifice!
guard me from noxious food!' he thereby says, 'Protect me from all kinds
of injury!'--'Make our nourishment free from poison!'--nourishment means
food: 'make our food wholesome, faultless!' this is what he thereby
says.--'In the lap, pleasant to sit in;' he thereby says, 'in
thyself.'--'Svâhâ! Vâ*t*!' since one offers what has been consecrated by
vasha*t*,' this (residue of butter) thereby becomes such for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:21">1:9:2:21</span></span>21. The
mistress then unties the veda-bunch. The altar (vedi) assuredly is
female and the veda is male. For union the veda was made: and
accordingly when he touches, (the altar) with it during the sacrifice, a
union productive of offspring is thereby effected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:22">1:9:2:22</span></span>22. And
(the reason) why it is the mistress who unties the veda (is this): the
mistress is female and the veda is male; consequently a union productive
of offspring is thereby effected: this is why the mistress unties the
veda.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:23">1:9:2:23</span></span>23. She
unties it. Should she wish to do so

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

with a Ya*g*us-text, let her do so with this one (Vâ*g*. S. II, 21 a),
'The Veda art thou: whereby thou, O divine Veda, hast become Veda for
the gods, thereby mayest thou become Veda for me <span
id="fr_614"></span>[1](#fn_610)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:24">1:9:2:24</span></span>24.
(The Hot*ri*) strews it (from the Gârhapatya) as far as (the east end
of) the altar <span id="fr_615"></span>[2](#fn_611); for the altar is
female and the veda is male; and from behind the male approaches the
female: from behind (i.e. west) he accordingly causes it (the altar) to
be approached by that male, the veda. For this reason he strews (the
grass of the veda) as far as (the east end of) the altar.

#### CONCLUDING CEREMONIES.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:25">1:9:2:25</span></span>25. He
(the Adhvaryu) now makes the samish*t*aya*g*us-oblation, thinking, 'In
the east my sacrifice shall be completed!' Were he to perform the
samish*t*aya*g*us-oblation first and then the patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as, that
sacrifice of his would be completed in the west (behind the
sacrificer) <span id="fr_616"></span>[3](#fn_612): hence he makes

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

the samish*t*aya*g*us-oblation at this particular time, thinking, 'In
the east my sacrifice shall be completed!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:26">1:9:2:26</span></span>26. Now
as to why it is called samish*t*aya*g*us <span
id="fr_617"></span>[1](#fn_613): whatever deities he invites through
this (new or full-moon) sacrifice, and for whichever deities this
sacrifice is performed, all those are thereby 'sacrificed to together'
(sam-ish*t*a); and because he now makes a (butter) oblation <span
id="fr_618"></span>[2](#fn_614) to all those deities, who have been
'sacrificed to together,' therefore this (oblation) is called
samish*t*aya*g*us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:27">1:9:2:27</span></span>27. And
again as to why he performs the samish*t*aya*g*us: whatever deities he
invites through this sacrifice, and for whichever deities this sacrifice
is performed, they continue waiting until the samish*t*aya*g*us is
performed, thinking, 'This he must offer to us!' These same (deities) he
thereby dismisses in due form; and whatever be the practice in their
case in accordance with that he has, in thus performing it, produced the
sacrifice, and having thus produced it he now establishes it safely
where there is a safe basis for it: this is why he performs the
samish*t*aya*g*us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:28">1:9:2:28</span></span>28. He
makes the offering, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 21 b), 'Ye path-finding
gods,'--for the gods

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

are indeed the finders of the path <span
id="fr_619"></span>[1](#fn_615);--'Having found the path--,' thereby he
says, 'having found the sacrifice;'--'Walk in the path!' thereby he
dismisses them in due form;--'O divine Lord of mind, this
sacrifice--Svâhâ!--give to the wind!' for the sacrifice, indeed, is that
blowing one (the wind). Having accordingly prepared this (special)
sacrifice, he thereby establishes it safely in that (chief, full or
new-moon) sacrifice, and thus unites sacrifice with sacrifice: for this
reason he says, 'Svâhâ! give (it) to the wind!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:29">1:9:2:29</span></span>29. He
then offers up the barhis, The barhis, truly, is this world, and the
barhis (consists of) plants: hence he thereby bestows plants on this
world, and these plants are safely established in this world: for this
reason he offers up the barhis.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:30">1:9:2:30</span></span>30.
This offering he makes as an additional one, since the samish*t*aya*g*us
is the end of the sacrifice, and consequently what comes after the
samish*t*aya*g*us is additional; and because, in performing the
samish*t*aya*g*us, he offers to those (deities <span
id="fr_620"></span>[2](#fn_616)), and thence additional unlimited plants
are here produced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:31">1:9:2:31</span></span>31. He
offers it, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 22), 'May the barhis combine
with the sacrificial food, with the butter! May Indra combine with the
Âdityas, the Vasus, the Maruts, and the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*! May what (has
been offered with) "Svâhâ" go up to the heavenly ether <span
id="fr_621"></span>[3](#fn_617)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:32">1:9:2:32</span></span>32.
Having thereupon walked round (from the

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

north side of the Âhavanîya fire) to the south, he pours the
pra*n*îtâ-water <span id="fr_622"></span>[1](#fn_618) out (on the
altar). Now, when he spreads the sacrifice, he yokes it. But were he not
to pour out (the pra*n*îtâ-water), the sacrifice, being unyoked, would,
in moving backward, injure the sacrificer. In this way, however, the
sacrifice does not injure the sacrificer; and for this reason he pours
out the pra*n*îtâ-water, after walking round to the south.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:33">1:9:2:33</span></span>33. He
pours it out, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 23 a), 'Who <span
id="fr_623"></span>[2](#fn_619) unyokes thee? He unyokes thee! For whom
does he unyoke thee? For him he unyokes thee! For plenty!' He thereby
announces to the sacrificer the highest prosperity. He pours it out with
the same (vessel) with which he brings it forward; for wherewith they
yoke the team, therewith they also unyoke it; with the yoke-tie they
yoke it, and with the yoke-tie they unyoke it. By means of a potsherd he
now throws the refuse from the cleaning of the rice <span
id="fr_624"></span>[3](#fn_620) right under the black antelope skin;
with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 23 b), 'The Rakshas' share art thou!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:34">1:9:2:34</span></span>34. Now
the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, were
contending about this sacrifice, (that is, their) father Pra*g*âpati,
the year. 'Ours it (he) shall be! ours it shall be,' they said.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:9:2:35">1:9:2:35</span></span>35.
Thereupon the gods obtained possession of the whole of the sacrifice,
and dispossessed those

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Asuras) of it by
(giving them) what was the worst part of the sacrifice, to wit, with the
blood of the victim (they dispossessed them) of the animal sacrifice,
and with the refuse of the rice of the havirya*gñ*a. 'May they be duly
dispossessed of the sacrifice,' they thought for he indeed is duly
dispossessed, who is dispossessed even while obtaining a (worthless)
share. He, on the other hand, who is dispossessed without any share
whatever, hopes for a while, and when it occurs to him, he says, 'What
share hast thou given me?' Hence what share the gods set apart for those
(Asuras), that same share he now makes over to them in pouring (the
refuse of the rice) right under the black antelope skin. He thereby
casts it into blind darkness, where there is no (sacrificial) fire. And
in the same way he casts the blood of the victim into blind darkness,
where there is no fire; thinking, 'Thou art the Rakshas' share!' For
this reason they use not the gore of the victim (for sacrificial
purposes), since it is the Rakshas' share.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_598"></span>[256:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_602) The meaning of the
term seems to be 'offerings made (to some deities) along with the wives
(of the gods);' the deities to whom the four offerings are made, being
Soma, Tvash*tri*, the Devapatnya*h* (wives of the gods), and Agni
G*ri*hapati.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[256:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_603) The lady of the
house occupies a seat south-west of the Gârhapatya fire. See I, 3, 1,
12. The Adhvaryu now sits down with raised knees (south of her, with his
face to the north-east). Kâty. III, 7, 5. The Âgnîdhra sits down in the
same way north of the fire, with his face to the south, and the Hot*ri*
in the middle; cf. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollm. p. 151.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[257:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_604) Or, 'is produced
from the hind-part of the sacrifice,' i.e. from the sacrificer's wife,
seated behind the altar, see par. 3.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[258:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_605) The Adhvaryu calls
on the Hot*ri*: 'For Soma (Tvash*tri*, &c. respectively)' (in a low
voice)--'recite!' (aloud). The Hot*ri* then recites the invitatory
prayer (anuvâkyâ, for which see Â*s*v. *S*r. I, 10, 5) in a low voice,
except the concluding 'om!' which he pronounces aloud. The Adhvaryu now
calls on the Âgnîdhra, who responds with 'Astu *s*rausha*t*.' Thereupon
the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot*ri*; 'For Soma,' &c. (in a low
voice),--'pronounce the offering prayer!' (aloud); and the Hot*ri*
recites the yâ*g*yâ, in a low voice, except the concluding 'Vausha*t*,'
which is pronounced aloud, and simultaneously with which the Adhvaryu
pours the oblation (consisting of four ladlings of butter from the
butter-pot into the *g*uhû, by means of the sruva) into the fire.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[258:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_606) He does so in his
capacity of divine artificer and architect.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[259:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_607) *G*ighatsanti, 'eat
greedily, swallow their food.' The Kâ*n*va text does not mention
Yâ*gñ*avalkya, but merely says, 'hence women also here swallow their
food apart from men.'

<span id="fn_604"></span>[259:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_608) The i*d*â-ceremony
(I, 8, 1, 18) is repeated after the patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as, together with the
*S*a*m*yuvâka and the offering of remains, but with special reference to
the mistress of the house. Since the prastara-bunch and the
enclosing-sticks have already been consumed by the fire, the Sûktavâka
is omitted on the present occasion; the Adhvaryu merely throwing a stalk
of the reed-grass of the veda into the fire, as a substitute for the
stalk of the prastara (representing the sacrificer).

<span id="fn_605"></span>[259:3](sbe1238.htm#fr_609) See I, 8, 3, 11
seq.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[260:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_610) See I, 8, 3, 19
seq.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[260:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_611) That is, after the
Hot*ri* has again recited the Sa*m*yuvâka, in the same way as above, I,
9, I, 26-29.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[260:3](sbe1238.htm#fr_612) Viz. at the
offering of the remains of butter (I, 8, 3, 23), of which the present
ceremony is the counterpart. Dr. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollm. p. 160,
(after a scholiast) calls this modification Pragraha-homa (offered to
Agni adabdhâyu a*s*îtama). According to Kâty. III, 7, 18; 19, this
ceremony is followed by the performance, in the Dakshi*n*a fire, of two
(*g*uhoti) oblations of butter, to Agni sa*m*ve*s*apati and Sarasvatî
respectively (see the formulas Vâ*g*. S. II, 20, b, c); and the
pish*t*alepa-âhuti to the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*, being an offering of the
remnants of dough, left from the preparation of the sacrificial cakes.
These offerings would then be succeeded by the ceremonies treated in
par. 22 seq.

<span id="fn_609"></span>[261:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_613) Harisvâmin derives
a*s*îtama and a*s*ish*th*a from a*s*, 'to eat' (instead of from a*s*,
'to reach, penetrate'), hence 'the greatest eater.' Mahîdhara gives both
derivations.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[262:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_614) According to Katy.
III, 8, 2, the lady thereupon unties the grass-cord with which she was
girt (see I, 3, 1, 12), with the text, 'I free myself from Varu*n*a's
noose wherewith the gracious Savit*ri* bound me; place me unscathed,
together with my husband, in the lap of eternal law, in the world of
righteousness!' Â*s*v. I, 11, 3, however, assigns this ceremony to the
Hot*ri*; and no doubt rightly, since it is not mentioned by our author,
and the Vâ*g*. S. does not give the formula. Thereby also the original
form of the text (Rig-veda X, 85, 24), 'I free thee,' &c., is preserved.
Mahîdhara on Vâ*g*. S. here takes 'veda' either in the sense of 'the
Veda (*Ri*k, &c.),' or as 'the knower.' Perhaps it should rather be
taken as 'the obtainer.'

<span id="fn_611"></span>[262:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_615) Thus â vede*h* is
explained by Harisvâmin (according to comm. on Katy. III, 8, 3). Others
take it in the sense of 'up to where the barhis begins.'

<span id="fn_612"></span>[262:3](sbe1238.htm#fr_616) The
patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as were performed in the Gârhapatya fire, and therefore
west of the altar; and on their completion, the priests betake
themselves back to the Âhavanîya.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[263:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_617) The real original
meaning of the term would rather seem to have been 'the formula marking
the completion of the sacrifice,' it having afterwards come to be
applied to the oblation (to the wind-god) itself. Cf. par. 30 and Weber,

<span id="fn_614"></span>[263:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_618) Or rather, 'because
to all those deities to whom an ish*t*i (or ya*g*ati-offering, made by
the Adhvaryu standing south of the altar; and followed or accompanied by
the vasha*t*-call) has been offered in common, he now makes an âhuti (or
*g*uhoti-offering, made by him whilst standing north of the altar, with
the svâhâ-call).'

<span id="fn_615"></span>[264:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_619) Mahîdhara refers
gâtu-vida*h* and vittvâ to vid, 'to know.'

<span id="fn_616"></span>[264:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_620) According to
Harisvâmin, he does so, since that offering is made for the sake of
dismissing (satisfying) the deities.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[264:3](sbe1238.htm#fr_621) Mahîdhara
interprets, 'May Indra--together with the Âdityas, the Vasus, the
Maruts, and the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*--anoint the barhis thoroughly with the
havis-like ghee,' &c.

According to the Paddhati on Katy. III, 8, the Adhvaryu holds the
deer-skin with his left hand over the utkara, or heap of rubbish, and
pours the refuse under the skin on the utkara.
