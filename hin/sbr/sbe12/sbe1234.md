### EIGHTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE I*D*Â.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:1">1:8:1:1</span></span>1. In the
morning they brought to Manu <span id="fr_506"></span>[1](#fn_503) water
for washing, just as now also they (are wont to) bring (water) for
washing the hands. When he was washing himself, a fish came into his
hands.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:2">1:8:1:2</span></span>2. It
spake to him the word, 'Rear me, I will save thee!' 'Wherefrom wilt thou
save me?' 'A flood will carry away all these creatures <span
id="fr_507"></span>[2](#fn_504): from that I will save thee!' 'How am I
to rear thee?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:3">1:8:1:3</span></span>3. It
said, 'As long as we are small, there is great destruction for us: fish
devours fish. Thou wilt first keep me in a jar. When I outgrow that,
thou wilt dig a pit and keep me in it. When I outgrow that, thou wilt
take me down to the sea, for then I shall be beyond destruction.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:4">1:8:1:4</span></span>4. It
soon became a *gh*asha (a large fish); for that grows largest (of all
fish) <span id="fr_508"></span>[3](#fn_505). Thereupon it said, 'In such
and such a year that flood will come. Thou

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

shalt then attend to me (i.e. to my advice) by preparing a ship <span
id="fr_509"></span>[1](#fn_506); and when the flood has risen thou shalt
enter into the ship, and I will save thee from it.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:5">1:8:1:5</span></span>5. After
he had reared it in this way, he took it down to the sea. And in the
same year which the fish had indicated to him, he attended to (the
advice of the fish) by preparing a ship; and when the flood had risen,
he entered into the ship. The fish then swam up to him, and to its horn
he tied the rope of the ship, and by that means he <span
id="fr_510"></span>[2](#fn_507) passed swiftly up to yonder northern
mountain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:6">1:8:1:6</span></span>6. It
then said, 'I have saved thee. Fasten the ship to a tree; but let not
the water cut thee off <span id="fr_511"></span>[3](#fn_508), whilst
thou art on the mountain. As the water

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

subsides, thou mayest gradually descend!' Accordingly he gradually
descended, and hence that (slope) of the northern mountain is called
'Alarm's descent <span id="fr_512"></span>[1](#fn_509).' The flood then
swept away all these creatures, and Manu alone remained here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:7">1:8:1:7</span></span>7. Being
desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and austerities. During
this time he also performed a pâka-sacrifice: he offered up in the
waters clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds. Thence a woman was
produced in a year: becoming quite solid <span
id="fr_513"></span>[2](#fn_510) she rose; clarified butter gathered in
her footprint. Mitra and Varu*n*a met her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:8">1:8:1:8</span></span>8. They
said to her, 'Who art thou?' 'Manu's daughter,' she replied. 'Say (thou
art) ours,' they said. 'No,' she said, 'I am (the daughter) of him who
begat me.' They desired to have a share in her. She either agreed or did
not agree <span id="fr_514"></span>[3](#fn_511), but passed by them. She
came to Manu.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:9">1:8:1:9</span></span>9. Manu
said to her, 'Who art thou?' 'Thy daughter,' she replied. 'How,
illustrious one, (art thou) my daughter?' he asked. She replied,

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Those offerings
(of) clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds, which thou madest in
the waters, with them thou hast begotten me. I am the blessing
(benediction): make use of me at the sacrifice! If thou wilt make use of
me at the sacrifice, thou wilt become rich in offspring and cattle.
Whatever blessing thou shalt invoke through me, all that shall be
granted to thee!' He accordingly made use of her (as the benediction) in
the middle of the sacrifice; for what is intermediate between the
fore-offerings and the after-offerings, is the middle of the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:10">1:8:1:10</span></span>10.
With her he went on worshipping and performing austerities, wishing for
offspring. Through her he generated this race, which is this race of
Manu; and whatever blessing he invoked through her, all that was granted
to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:11">1:8:1:11</span></span>11. Now
this (daughter of Manu) is essentially the same as the I*d*â; and
whosoever, knowing this, performs with (the) I*d*â <span
id="fr_515"></span>[1](#fn_512), he propagates this race which Manu
generated; and whatever blessing he invokes through it (or her), all
that is granted to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:12">1:8:1:12</span></span>12. It
(the i*d*â) consists of a fivefold cutting; for the i*d*â, doubtless,
means cattle, and cattle consist of five parts <span
id="fr_516"></span>[2](#fn_513): for this reason it (the i*d*â) consists
of a fivefold cutting.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:13">1:8:1:13</span></span>13.
When he (the Adhvaryu) has cut off the i*d*â piece by piece <span
id="fr_517"></span>[3](#fn_514), and broken off the fore-part of the

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

cake (for the sacrificer's portion), he puts it (the latter) down (on
the barhis) before the dhruvâ-spoon. Having then handed over the former
(the i*d*â) to the Hot*ri* <span id="fr_518"></span>[1](#fn_515), he
passes by him towards the south.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:14">1:8:1:14</span></span>14. He
anoints the Hot*ri* here <span id="fr_519"></span>[2](#fn_516) (with
clarified butter taken from the i*d*â); and with it the Hot*ri* anoints
his lips, with the text, 'Of thee, offered by the lord of the mind, I
eat for sap, for out-breathing!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:15">1:8:1:15</span></span>15. He
then anoints the Hot*ri* here <span id="fr_520"></span>[2](#fn_516); and
with it the Hot*ri* anoints his lips, with the text, 'Of thee, offered
by the lord of speech, I eat for strength, for in-breathing!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:16">1:8:1:16</span></span>16. At
that time, namely, Manu became apprehensive (thinking), 'This (part) of
my sacrifice--that is, this i*d*â representing the domestic offering--is
certainly the weakest: the Rakshas must not

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

injure my sacrifice at this place.' Accordingly by that (butter, taken
from the i*d*â, and smeared on his lips) he promoted it (the i*d*â to a
safe place, thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas
(come)!' And in like manner this one also thereby promotes (the i*d*â to
a safe place, thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas
(come)!' And though he does not (at present) eat (the i*d*â) visibly,
lest he should eat it before it is invoked, he nevertheless promotes it
(to a safe place), when he smears the (butter) on his lips.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:17">1:8:1:17</span></span>17. He
now cuts off piece by piece (the avântare*d*â) in (or, into) the
Hot*ri*'s hand. That which is cut up piece by piece he thus makes
visibly enter <span id="fr_521"></span>[1](#fn_517) the Hot*ri*; and
through that which has entered (or is cooked in) his own self, the
Hot*ri* invokes a blessing on the sacrificer: for this reason he cuts it
off piece by piece in the Hot*ri*'s hand <span
id="fr_522"></span>[2](#fn_518).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:18">1:8:1:18</span></span>18. He
now calls <span id="fr_523"></span>[3](#fn_519) (the i*d*â) in a low
voice. At that time, namely, Manu became apprehensive (thinking), 'This
(part) of my sacrifice--that is, this i*d*â

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

representing the domestic offerings--is certainly the weakest: the
Rakshas must not injure my sacrifice at this place.' He accordingly
called it to him in a low voice (thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)!
before the Rakshas (come)!' And in like manner this one (the Hot*ri*)
thereby calls it (thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the
Rakshas (come)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:19">1:8:1:19</span></span>19. He
calls thus (in a low voice) <span id="fr_524"></span>[1](#fn_520),
'Hither is called the Rathantara (chant), together with the earth: may
the Rathantara, together with the earth, call me <span
id="fr_525"></span>[2](#fn_521)! Hither is called the Vâmadevya (chant),
together with the atmosphere: may the Vâmadevya, together with the
atmosphere, call me! Hither is called the B*ri*hat (chant), together
with the sky: may the B*ri*hat, together with the sky, call me!' In thus
calling her (the I*d*â) to him, he calls to him both these (three)
worlds and those chants <span id="fr_526"></span>[3](#fn_522).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:20">1:8:1:20</span></span>20.
'Hither are called the cows <span id="fr_527"></span>[4](#fn_523),
together with the

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

bull!'--the i*d*â, assuredly, means cattle: hence it is her he thereby
calls in an indirect (mystic) way; (and in saying), 'together with the
bull,' he calls her together with her mate.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:21">1:8:1:21</span></span>21.
'Hither is called (I*d*â) by that (sacrifice) which is performed by the
seven Hot*ri*s!'--he thereby calls her by the Soma-sacrifice performed
by the seven Hot*ri*s <span id="fr_528"></span>[1](#fn_524).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:22">1:8:1:22</span></span>22.
'Hither is called I*d*â, the conquering!'--he thereby calls her
directly. 'Conquering' he says, because she overcomes evil, and for that
reason he calls her 'the conquering.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:23">1:8:1:23</span></span>23.
'Hither is called the friend, the food <span
id="fr_529"></span>[2](#fn_525)!'--the friend, the food, doubtless,
means breath: hence he thereby calls hither the breath. 'Hither is
called the Hek <span id="fr_530"></span>[3](#fn_526)!'--he thereby calls
hither the (body of i*d*â), he thereby calls hither the entire (i*d*â).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:24">1:8:1:24</span></span>24. He
now intones (in a loud voice): 'I*d*â is called hither! Hither (thither)
is called I*d*â! May I*d*â also call us to her!' In saying, 'I*d*â is
called

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

hither,' he, in a direct way, calls her, who is thereby called hither,
as being what she really was: a cow, assuredly, she was, and a cow is
four-footed; and therefore he calls her four times <span
id="fr_531"></span>[1](#fn_527).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:25">1:8:1:25</span></span>25. But
in calling her four times, he calls her in different ways, in order to
avoid repetition (of sacrificial performance); for, if he were to call,
'I*d*â is called hither! I*d*â is called hither!' or 'Hither is called
Ida! hither is called I*d*â!' he would indeed commit the (fault of)
repetition. By saying, 'I*d*â is called hither!' he calls her
hitherwards; and by 'Hither (or thither, lit. called to somebody) is
called I*d*â!' he calls her thitherwards. By saying, 'May I*d*â also
call us to her,' he does not omit himself, and, besides, it (the
formula) is changed. By (the second), 'I*d*â is called hither!' he again
calls her hitherwards; so that he thereby (and by the second, 'Hither is
called I*d*â,' again) calls her hitherwards and thitherwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:26">1:8:1:26</span></span>26.
'Manu's daughter, the butter-pathed (gh*ri*tapadî);'--Manu, indeed,
begat her of old: for this reason he says, 'Manu's daughter.' 'The
butter-pathed' he says, because butter gathered in her footprint:
therefore he calls her 'butter-pathed.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:27">1:8:1:27</span></span>27. And
further, 'She who belongs to Mitra and Varu*n*a;'--this 'Maitrâvaru*n*a
nature' (is hers), because she met Mitra and Varu*n*a <span
id="fr_532"></span>[2](#fn_528).--'She, the god-fashioned one, is called
hither as the Brahman <span id="fr_533"></span>[3](#fn_529);

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

for she, the god-fashioned one, is indeed called hither as their
Brahman.--'Hither are called the divine Adhvaryus, called hither the
human!'--he thereby calls both the divine Adhvaryus and those that are
human: the divine Adhvaryus indeed are the calves <span
id="fr_534"></span>[1](#fn_530) (vatsâ*h*), and what others there are,
are the human ones.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:28">1:8:1:28</span></span>28.
'--They who are to prosper this sacrifice, they who are to prosper the
lord of sacrifice.' Those Brâhma*n*as, who have studied and teach the
Veda, assuredly prosper the sacrifice, since they spread (perform) and
produce it: these he thereby propitiates. And the calves also assuredly
make the lord of sacrifice prosper; for the lord of sacrifice who
possesses abundance of them, does indeed prosper; for this reason he
says, 'They who are to prosper the lord of sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:29">1:8:1:29</span></span>29.
'Hither are called the primeval, law-abiding, divine (fem.) heaven and
earth, whose sons are gods.' He thereby calls to him those two, heaven
and earth, within which all this (universe) is embraced.--'Hither is
called this sacrificer:' thereby he calls the sacrificer to him. Why he
does not mention his name on this occasion, is that this is a mysterious
benediction on the i*d*â. Were he, on the contrary, to mention the name,
he would do what is human, and the human certainly is inauspicious at
the sacrifice: hence he does not mention

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

the name, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice <span
id="fr_535"></span>[1](#fn_531).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:30">1:8:1:30</span></span>30.
'Hither (he is) called for future worship of the gods;' he thereby in a
mysterious manner invokes the blessing of life on this (sacrificer); for
as he sacrificed heretofore, so, while living, he will sacrifice
hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:31">1:8:1:31</span></span>31.
Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of
offspring for him; for whosoever has offspring,--while he, on his part,
goes to yonder world, his offspring sacrifice in this world: hence
future worship of the gods means offspring.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:32">1:8:1:32</span></span>32.
Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of
cattle for him; for whosoever has cattle, will sacrifice hereafter, as
he has sacrificed heretofore.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:33">1:8:1:33</span></span>33.
'Hither (he is) called for more abundant havis-offering;' he thereby in
a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of life on him; for as he has
sacrificed heretofore, so while living will he hereafter again and again
make offerings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:34">1:8:1:34</span></span>34.
Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of
offspring for this (sacrificer); for whosoever possesses
offspring,--though he, of his own self, be one only, yet that offering
is made tenfold by his offspring: hence offspring means more abundant
offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:35">1:8:1:35</span></span>35.
Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of
cattle for him; for whosoever possesses cattle, will make offering again
and again, as he has sacrificed heretofore.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:36">1:8:1:36</span></span>36.
This then is the benediction (implied in these formulas), 'May I live,
may I have offspring, may

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I obtain
prosperity!' Now in praying for the blessing of cattle, he prays for
prosperity; for cattle means prosperity: hence through these two
benedictions everything is obtained; and therefore these two
benedictions are here pronounced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:37">1:8:1:37</span></span>37.
\[He continues to call\], 'Hither (he is) called to this (sacrifice, for
the prayer <span id="fr_536"></span>[1](#fn_532)), "May the gods
graciously accept this my offering (havis)!''' he thereby invokes
complete success on the sacrifice; for what offering the gods graciously
accept, by that one gains great things: for this reason he says, 'may
they graciously accept <span id="fr_537"></span>[2](#fn_533).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:38">1:8:1:38</span></span>38.
They (the priests and sacrificer) eat it (the i*d*â), and do not offer
it up in the fire; for assuredly the i*d*â means cattle: hence they do
not offer it in the fire, lest they should throw the cattle into the
fire.

39\. In the vital airs rather it is offered, partly in the Hot*ri*,
partly in the Sacrificer, partly in the Adhvaryu. Now, when he has
broken off the forepart of the (Agni) cake, he places it before the
dhruvâ-spoon. But the dhruvâ represents the sacrificer: hence this will
be eaten by the sacrificer. And if he does not now visibly eat it, lest
he should eat before the sacrifice is completed, it nevertheless is now
(symbolically) eaten by him. All of them

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

eat (of the i*d*â): 'May it be offered for me in all!' thus (he thinks).
Five eat of it,--the i*d*â indeed means cattle, and cattle are fivefold:
hence five eat of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:40">1:8:1:40</span></span>40. Now
when he (the Hot*ri*) intones (in a loud voice) <span
id="fr_538"></span>[1](#fn_534), he (the Adhvaryu) divides the (Agni)
cake into four parts, and lays it on the barhis (the sacrificial grass
covering the altar). Here it lies in place of the fathers; for there are
four intermediate quarters, and the intermediate quarters represent the
fathers: for this reason he divides the cake into four parts, and lays
it on the barhis <span id="fr_539"></span>[2](#fn_535).

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:41">1:8:1:41</span></span>41. And
when he recites, 'Hither are called heaven and earth,' he hands it (the
sha*d*avatta <span id="fr_540"></span>[1](#fn_536)) to the Âgnîdhra. The
Âgnîdhra eats (the two pieces), with the respective texts (Vâ*g*. S. II,
10-11), 'Hither is called mother Earth; may mother Earth call me to her!
Agni (am I) by virtue of my Âgnîdhraship. Hail!' 'Hither is called
father Heaven; may father Heaven call me to him! Agni (am I) by virtue
of my Âgnîdhraship. Hail!' He, the Âgnîdhra, truly is the representative
of heaven and earth, and therefore he eats (the sha*d*avatta) in this
manner.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:42">1:8:1:42</span></span>42. And
when (the Hot*ri*) pronounces the benediction <span
id="fr_541"></span>[2](#fn_537), then (the sacrificer) mutters (Vâ*g*.
S. II, 10 a), 'May Indra bestow on me that power of his! may abundant
riches accrue to us! may there be blessings for us! may there be true
blessings for us!' For indeed this is a receiving of blessings: hence
what blessings the priests on this occasion invoke on him, those he
thereby receives and makes his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:43">1:8:1:43</span></span>43.
\[On the conclusion of the invocation and the eating <span
id="fr_542"></span>[3](#fn_538)\] they cleanse themselves (with water
poured)

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

through the two strainers (pavitra, 'purifier'). For they have now
performed the i*d*â, which represents the domestic offerings; and
thinking, 'Purified by the purifiers we will now perform what part of
the sacrifice remains still unaccomplished,' they cleanse themselves
with the strainers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:8:1:44">1:8:1:44</span></span>44. He
(the Adhvaryu) then throws the two strainers on the prastara <span
id="fr_543"></span>[1](#fn_539). The prastara, doubtless, represents the
sacrificer, and the two strainers the out-breathing and in-breathing:
hence he thereby invokes out-breathing and in-breathing on the
sacrificer; and for this reason he throws the strainers on the prastara.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_503"></span>[216:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_506) For other
translations of this important legend of the deluge, see A. Weber, Ind.
Streifen, I, p. 9 (Ind. Stud. I, 161 seq:).; Max Müller, History of
Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 425; J. Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts,
I, p. 182. For the later versions of the same legend, especially the one
from the Mahâbhârata (Vanaparvan 22747-12802), see Original Sanskrit
Texts, I, p. 196 seq.

<span id="fn_504"></span>[216:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_507) According to the
scholiast, 'it will carry away all these creatures that live in
Bharatavarsha to some other country.'

<span id="fn_505"></span>[216:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_508) ? Sa*s*vad dha
*gh*asha âsa, sa hi *g*yesh*th*a*m* vardhate ’thetithî*m* samâ*m* tad
augha âgantâ. 'Bald war er ein Grossfisch (*gh*asha), denn er wuchs
gewaltig,' Weber. 'He became soon a large fish. He said to Manu, "When I
am full-grown, in the same year the flood will come,"' Max Müller.
'Straightway he became a large fish; for he waxes to the utmost,' Muir.
Perhaps *gh*asha is here intended for the name of some fabulous horned
fish (cf. *sri*ṅgi, *sri*ṅgî). In the Black Ya*g*ur-veda (Taitt. S. I,
7, 1; II, 6, 7) the <span id="page_217">p. 217</span> i*d*â is
represented as a cow, produced by Mitra and Varu*n*a (see below, par.
24). Perhaps it was this version and the symbolical representation of
the i*d*â as meaning cattle, which suggested the notion of a horned
fish, in adapting an older legend.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[217:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_509) I adopt here,
though not without hesitation, the interpretation proposed in the St.
Petersb. Dict. (s.v. upa-âs), which the separation of mâm from the verb
favours. Professor Max Müller translates: 'Build a ship then, and
worship me.' Dr. Muir: 'Thou shalt, therefore, construct a ship, and
resort to me.' The Mahâbhârata has: 'When standing on the ship, thou
shalt look out for me: I shall be recognisable (by my being) furnished
with a horn,' which, after all, may furnish the correct explanation of
our passage.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[217:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_510) Or, 'it,' that is,
either the ship, or the fish. That abhi-dudrâva, the reading of the
Kâ*n*va school, is the right one, seems to follow from the next
paragraph. Professor Weber's edition has ati-dudrâva, as read by his
best MS., 'it (or he) sailed across the mountain.' The reading of the
other MSS. adhi-dudrâva must be a clerical error, most likely for
abhi-dudrâva. Professor Müller translates: 'The fish carried him by it
over the northern mountain.' Dr. Muir: 'By this means he passed over
(or, he hastened to) this northern mountain.'

<span id="fn_508"></span>[217:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_511) Anta*skh*aitsît,?
'cut thee asunder,' Max Müller; 'wash thee away;' 'fortspült,' Weber;
'abschneiden, intercludere,' St. Petersb. Dict. I adopt this last
meaning, = 'leave thee stranded.'

<span id="fn_509"></span>[218:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_512) According to the
version of the Mahâbhârata, 'the peak of the Himâlaya to which the ship
was tied, was afterwards called naubandhana, 'the tying of the ship.'
Professor Weber also draws attention to Ath.-veda XIX, 39, 8, where the
term nâvaprabhra*ms*ana or 'gliding down of the ship' is used in
connection with the summit of the Himavat.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[218:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_513) Pibdamânâ-iva, as
taken by the St. Petersb. Dict. The meaning 'dripping with fat,
unctuous,' offered by the commentator, was probably suggested to him by
what follows in the text; and by the cow-version (p. 216, note 3),
Taitt. Br. II, 6, 7, 1.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[218:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_514) Or, as the
commentator takes it, 'she both promised and did not promise it;' that
is to say, she promised, inasmuch as she (I*d*â) is called
maitrâvaru*n*î (belonging to, or the daughter of, Mitra or Varu*n*a; see
XIV, 9, 4, 27), but refused, inasmuch as Mitra and Varu*n*a have no
share in the in portions.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[219:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_515) I*d*ayâ *k*arati
has the double meaning 'lives with I*d*â (the woman)' and 'practices
sacrificial rites with the i*d*â-ceremony.'

<span id="fn_513"></span>[219:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_516) See [p.
16](sbe1204.htm#page_16), note [1](sbe1204.htm#fn_106).

<span id="fn_514"></span>[219:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_517) The technical
expression used for this fivefold cutting of the i*d*â is sam-ava-do,
'to cut off completely (or together),' or, according to the St. Petersb.
Dict., 'to divide and collect the <span id="page_220">p. 220</span>
pieces.' The five cuttings of the i*d*â consist of the upastara*n*a, or
underlayer of butter in the i*d*âpâtrî; of two cuttings of each of the
havis (or dishes of sacrificial food) from their southern and central
parts respectively; and of two drippings (or bastings, abhighâra*n*a) of
butter, as in the case of the svish*t*ak*ri*t (see Kâty. III, 4, 6, and
note on I, 7, 3, 20). According to some authorities, the i*d*â consists
of four cuttings only (cf. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollm. p. 122).

<span id="fn_515"></span>[220:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_518) According to Kâty.
III, 4, 8, 9, he does so without quitting his hold of the i*d*â; and he
withdraws the latter from the Hot*ri*; when he anoints him.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[220:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_520) A gesture here
indicates the two middle joints (or, according to Harisvâmin, the
intermediate links) of the Hot*ri*'s right fore-finger, viz. first the
lower joint, and afterwards (par. 15) the upper joint; whereupon the
Hot*ri* applies the respective joints to his lips and smears the butter
on them, cf. Â*s*v. *S*. I, 7, 1; Kâty. III, 4, 9; Hillebrandt, op.
cit., p. 124. In *S*at. Br. XII, 2, 4, 5 the fore-finger is called
annâditamâ, or the finger 'which eats most food;' cf. Weber,
Prati*gñ*âsûtra, p. 97.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[221:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_521) Enâm hotari
*s*rayati, literally 'he makes it enter into, remain in, the Hot*ri*.'
The author, however, here, as in I, 6, 4, 7, mixes up the verb *s*ri
with *s*râ, 'to cook.' The reason for this see [p.
177](sbe1229.htm#page_177), note [4](sbe1229.htm#fn_408).

<span id="fn_518"></span>[221:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_522) This, according to
Â*s*v. *S*r. I, 7, 3, and comm., is effected in the following way: the
Hot*ri* takes the i*d*â with his joined hands (a*ñg*ali) and makes it
lie in his left hand; whereupon the Adhvaryu cuts the (fivefold cut)
avântare*d*â from the i*d*â into the Hot*ri*'s right hand, the fingers
of which point northwards; the five cuttings apparently consist of the
'underlayer' of butter, two pieces cut from the i*d*â, and drippings of
butter on them. Cf. Hillebrandt, op. cit., p. 125.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[221:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_523) During the
invocation of the i*d*â the Hot*ri* holds the butter (as well as the
avântare*d*â), and the other priests (except the Brahman) and the
sacrificer touch the i*d*â (or, according to Karka, the Hot*ri*). Kâty.
III, 4, 11, 12.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[222:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_524) There are
considerable differences between the text of, the Hot*ri*'s call to the
i*d*â as here given and that given in Â*s*v. *S*. I, 7, 7. The text of
the Black Ya*g*ur-veda (Taitt. Br. III, 5, 8; Taitt. S. II, 6, 7; I, 7,
1), on the other hand, only differs from ours in one or two points.
According to Â*s*v. *S*. I, 5, 28, the calls are to be uttered in the
highest pitch (cf. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. 126, note).

<span id="fn_521"></span>[222:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_525) Viz. the Hot*ri*,
as the representative of the officiating priests. Schol.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[222:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_526) On the rathantara
and b*ri*hat sâmans, see [p. 196](sbe1231.htm#page_196), note
[2](sbe1231.htm#fn_446). The vâmadevya sâman is Sâma-veda II, 32-34:
kayâ na*s* *k*itra â bhuvad ûtî sadâv*ri*dha*h* sakhâ, 'with what favour
will he assist us, the wonderful, ever-gladdening, friend,' &c. Cf.
Haug, Ait. Br. II, 246.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[222:4](sbe1234.htm#fr_527) For upahûtâ
gâva*h*, the Taitt. reads upahûtâ dhenu*h*, 'called hither is the cow.'
Â*s*val. *S*r. has upahûtâ gâva*h* sahâ*s*ira*h*--upahûtâ dhenu*h*
saha*ri*shabhâ. Here and after the succeeding calls we have apparently
to supply the inverse formulas, 'May <span id="page_223">p. 223</span>
the cows together with the bull call us,' &c., as in Taitt. Br., they
being likewise omitted in Taitt. S. II, 6, 7.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[223:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_528) The seven Hot*ri*s
comprise the Hot*ri* with his assistants, the Maitrâvaru*n*a (or
Pra*s*âstri), and A*kkh*âvâka; and the chief assistants of the Brahman,
viz. the Brâhma*n*â*kkh*a*m*sin, Âgnîdhra, Pot*ri*, and Nesh*tri*. The
Grâvastut, another assistant of the Hot*ri*, is often added as eighth
Hot*ri*. Cf. Haug, Ait. Br. II, p. 147. Instead of upahûtâ saptahotrâ in
our text, the Kâ*n*va text and the Black Ya*g*ur-veda read upahûtâ*h*
saptahotrâ*h*, 'called hither are the seven Hot*ri*ships;' Â*s*val.
*S*r. upahûtâ divyâ sapta hotâra*h*, 'called hither are the seven divine
Hot*ri*s.'

<span id="fn_525"></span>[223:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_529) Bhaksha, 'the
eating, enjoying;' perhaps the author here takes it in the sense of
'feeder,' in that of 'eater, quaffer;' Sâya*n*a, on Taitt. S. II, 6, 7,
3, takes it as Soma-drink (somapîtha).

<span id="fn_526"></span>[223:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_530) Apparently, like
hikkâ (verb hikk), imitative of the internal sound of the hiccough. The
Kâ*n*va MS. has harik instead; and the Black Ya*g*us ho, which it
identifies with the self (âtman).

<span id="fn_527"></span>[224:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_531) After 'May I*d*â
also call us to her,' he repeats 'I*d*â is called hither! Called hither
(thither) is Ida!'

<span id="fn_528"></span>[224:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_532) See I, 8, 1, 7-8,
with note [3](#fn_511).

<span id="fn_529"></span>[224:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_533) Brahma
devak*ri*topahûtâ; the Black Ya*g*ur-veda and Â*s*val. *S*r. read
'brahma devak*ri*tam upahûtam.' Cf. Taitt. S. I, 7, 1, 5, brahma vai
devânâm b*ri*haspati*h*.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[225:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_534) ? The commentator
remarks: 'He says, The divine Adhvaryus assuredly are the calves,'
because, in his opinion, the sânnâyya constitutes the sacrificial food
which contains the Adhvaryus (havis--adhvaryuvat). In I, 1, 2, 17 we met
with the A*s*vins as the two divine Adhvaryus.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[226:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_535) With this and the
following paragraphs cf. I, 9, 1, 12 seq.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[227:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_536) See Sâya*n*a's
comm. on Taitt. S. II, 6, 7, 6.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[227:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_537) Before this formula
the Black Ya*g*ur-veda inserts, 'Called (he is) to the heavenly abode!'
and after it as the final formula, 'All that is dear to him (the
sacrificer) is called! Called (he is) of (? by) everything dear that is
called!' Taitt, Br. III, 5, 9, 3. For the modifications of the
concluding mantras in the case of the i*d*â being invoked for the
mistress of the house (*S*at. Br. I, 9, 2, 5), see Taitt. Br, III, 5,
13.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[228:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_538) Viz. 'I*d*a is
called hither!' see par. 24. According to Kâty. III, 4, 12, all (the
other priests and the sacrificer, probably with the exception of the
Brahman) touch the i*d*â (or, according to Karka, they touch the Hot*ri*
who holds the i*d*â) whilst the invocation of the i*d*â takes place. The
quartering of the cake, according to ib. 13, is done with the text,
'Make swell, O ruddy one! milk me life; milk me offspring; milk me
cattle; milk me brahmahood; milk me kshatriyahood; milk me people!
Fatten through the progeny, through the cattle of him who hates us, whom
we hate!'

<span id="fn_535"></span>[228:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_539) According to Kâty.
III, 4, 14, the Adhvaryu puts the four parts on the barhis and assigns
one to each priest. But according to the commentary and to other Sûtras,
it is the sacrificer who allocates the portions by laying them down so
as to correspond with the four intermediate regions, commencing in the
south-east (or Agni's) region, and saying, 'This for the Brahman,' 'This
for the Hot*ri*,' 'This for the Adhvaryu,' 'This for the Agnîdh.' The
sacrificer then shifts his Brâhmanical cord from the right to the left
shoulder, and while touching the four portions, and looking towards the
south (the region of the fathers), murmurs (Vâ*g*. S. II, 31), 'Here, O
fathers, regale yourselves! Like bulls come hither (âv*ri*shâyadhvam)
each to his own share!' He then quits his hold of the portions, and
murmurs, 'The fathers have regaled themselves: like bulls they came each
to his own share!' See *S*at. Br. II, 4, 2, 20 seq.; Vâ*g*. S. p. 57.
\[The Kâ*n*va text of the Brâhma*n*a does not mention the formulas here
any more than does our author.\] He then shifts the cord back on his
left shoulder, touches water, and hands the portions to the priests for
them to eat. Kâty. III, 4, 16-18.

<span id="fn_536"></span>[229:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_540) Kâty. *S*r. III, 4,
19. There is some uncertainty as to the particular time when the
Adhvaryu cuts the sha*d*avatta; cf. Hillebrandt, p. 123. Mahîdhara on
Vâ*g*. S. II, 10 remarks: When the Hot*ri* pronounces the call to heaven
and earth, then he (the Adhvaryu), having put one piece of each of the
two cakes in (the two bowls of) the Sha*d*avatta (vessel), gives it to
the Agnîdh; and the latter eats it with the formulas 'Hither is called
(the mother Earth),' &c. The 'six cuttings' of the Sha*d*avatta consist
of a piece of the Agni cake with an 'underlayer' and a dripping of
butter for each of the two bowls of the Sha*d*avatta dish.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[229:2](sbe1234.htm#fr_541) That is, the
formula 'Hither is called the sacrificer,' see par. 29.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[229:3](sbe1234.htm#fr_542) The priests eat
first their quarter of the cake and then, with the sacrificer, their
share of the i*d*â. The Hot*ri* eats also the avântare*d*â, with the
text (Â*s*v. *S*. I, 7, 8), 'O I*d*â, accept graciously our share!' &c.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[230:1](sbe1234.htm#fr_543) See I, 3, 2, 5 seq.
The Kâ*n*va text omits this paragraph.
