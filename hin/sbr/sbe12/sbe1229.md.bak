### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### SPECIAL PRELIMINARY RITES OF THE NEW-MOON SACRIFICE.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:1">1:6:4:1</span></span>1. When
Indra had hurled the thunderbolt at V*ri*tra, thinking himself to be the
weaker, and fearing lest he had not brought him down, he concealed
himself and went to the farthest distances <span
id="fr_403"></span>[1](#fn_400.md). Now the gods knew that V*ri*tra had
been slain and that Indra had concealed himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:2">1:6:4:2</span></span>2. Agni
of the deities, Hira*n*yastûpa <span id="fr_404"></span>[2](#fn_401.md) of
the *Ri*shis, and the B*ri*hatî of the metres, set about searching for
him. Agni discovered him and stayed

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

with him (as a guest) that (day and) night. He (Indra), namely, is the
Vasu <span id="fr_405"></span>[1](#fn_402.md) of the gods, for he is their
hero.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:3">1:6:4:3</span></span>3. The
gods said, 'Our Vasu, who has gone to live away from us, is this day
dwelling together (amâ vas, viz. with Agni <span
id="fr_406"></span>[2](#fn_403).md);' and as one would cook a dish of rice
or a goat in common for two relatives or friends who have come to stay
with him,--for such-like is human (fare), as the sacrificial food
(havis) is that of the gods,--in like manner they offered to those two
together that sacrificial food, the rice-cake on twelve potsherds for
Indra and Agni. This is the reason why there is a rice-cake on twelve
potsherds for Indra and Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:4">1:6:4:4</span></span>4. Indra
said, 'When I had hurled the thunderbolt at V*ri*tra, I was terrified,
and (in consequence of this fright) I am much emaciated. This (cake)
does not satiate me: prepare for me what will satiate me!' The gods
replied, 'So be it!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:5">1:6:4:5</span></span>5. The
gods said, 'Nothing but Soma will satiate him: let us prepare Soma for
him!' They prepared Soma for him. Now this king Soma, the food of the
gods, is no other than the moon <span id="fr_407"></span>[3](#fn_404.md).
When he

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the moon, masc.)
is not seen that night either in the east or in the west, then he visits
this world; and here he enters into the waters (f.) and plants (f.). He
is indeed a treasure for the gods, he is their food. And since during
that night he here dwells together <span id="fr_408"></span>[1](#fn_405.md)
(amâ vas), therefore that (night of new moon) is called amâvâsyâ (the
dwelling together, or at home).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:6">1:6:4:6</span></span>6. They
prepared it <span id="fr_409"></span>[2](#fn_406) (Soma for Indra.md),
after having it collected, part by part, by the cows: in eating plants
(they collected it) from the plants, and in drinking water (they
collected it) from the waters. Having prepared and coagulated it, and
made it strong (pungent), they gave it to him <span
id="fr_410"></span>[3](#fn_407.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:7">1:6:4:7</span></span>7. He
said, 'This does indeed satiate me, but it does not agree with me <span
id="fr_411"></span>[4](#fn_408.md): devise some means by which it may agree
with me!' They made it agree with him by means of boiled (milk).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:8">1:6:4:8</span></span>8. Now
although this (mixture of sweet and sour milk) is, indeed, one and the
same substance--it being milk (payas) and belonging to Indra--they,

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

nevertheless, declare it to be (two) different (substances). Since he
said 'it satiates (dhî) me,' therefore it is sour milk (dadhi); and
since they made it agree (*s*ri) with him with boiled milk (or, by
boiling), therefore it is (fresh) boiled milk (*sri*ta) <span
id="fr_412"></span>[1](#fn_409.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:9">1:6:4:9</span></span>9. In the
same way as the Soma stalk becomes strong <span
id="fr_413"></span>[2](#fn_410.md) (by being touched or sprinkled with
water), so he (Indra) became strong (by the Soma being mixed with boiled
milk) and overcame that evil, the jaundice <span
id="fr_414"></span>[3](#fn_411.md). Such is likewise the significance of
the new-moon ceremony (and the Sânnâyya, or libation of sweet and sour
milk offered to Indra thereat); and verily he who, knowing this, mixes
(sweet and sour milk at the new-moon sacrifice) in like manner increases
in offspring and cattle, and overcomes evil: let him therefore mix
together (sweet and sour milk) <span id="fr_415"></span>[4](#fn_412.md).

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:10">1:6:4:10</span></span>10. In
reference to this point they say, 'One who has not performed the
Soma-sacrifice <span id="fr_416"></span>[1](#fn_413.md), must not offer the
Sânnâyya; for, indeed, the Sânnâyya is (of the same significance as) a
Soma libation, and the latter is not permitted to one who is not a
Soma-sacrificer: hence he who has not performed the Soma-sacrifice, must
not offer the Sânnâyya.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:11">1:6:4:11</span></span>11. He
may nevertheless offer the Sânnâyya; for have we not heard within this
place <span id="fr_417"></span>[2](#fn_414) that he (Indra.md) said, 'Do ye
now offer Soma to me, and then ye will prepare for me that invigorating
draught (âpyâyana, viz. the Sânnâyya)!' 'This does not satiate me,
prepare for me what will satiate me!' That invigorating draught they
indeed prepared for

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

him, and therefore even one who has not performed the Soma-sacrifice,
may offer the Sânnâyya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:12">1:6:4:12</span></span>12. The
full-moon oblation, assuredly, belongs to the V*ri*tra-slayer, for by
means of it Indra slew V*ri*tra; and this new-moon oblation also
represents the slaying of V*ri*tra, since they prepared that
invigorating draught for him who had slain V*ri*tra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:13">1:6:4:13</span></span>13. An
offering in honour of the V*ri*tra-slayer, then, is the full-moon
sacrifice. V*ri*tra, assuredly, is no other than the moon <span
id="fr_418"></span>[1](#fn_415.md); and when during that night (of new
moon) he is not seen either in the east or in the west, then he (Indra)
completely destroys him by means of that (new-moon sacrifice), and
leaves nothing remaining of him. And, verily, he who knows this,
overcomes all evil and leaves nothing remaining of evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:14">1:6:4:14</span></span>14.
Here now some people enter upon the fast when they (still) see (the
moon, on the fourteenth day of the half-month), thinking, 'To-morrow he
will not rise: already, then, there is unfailing food for the gods in
yonder heaven <span id="fr_419"></span>[2](#fn_416.md), and to this we will
offer them more from hence (to-morrow)!'--He, indeed, is in a prosperous
state with whom, while the old food is still unfailing, fresh food is
accruing; for such a one has indeed abundant food. However, he is not
now offering Soma, but he is offering milk (i.e. the Sânnâyya), and that
(milk) becomes king Soma <span id="fr_420"></span>[3](#fn_417.md) (in
yonder world):

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:15">1:6:4:15</span></span>15. But
as they (the cows), previously (to the new moon), eat mere plants (not
imbued with the moon or Soma), and drink mere water, and yield mere
milk,--so that (milk which they offer on the day before new moon, is not
imbued with Soma, is ordinary milk). For king Soma, the food of the
gods, indeed, is no other than the moon. When he is not seen that night
either in the east or in the west, then he visits this world, and here
enters into the waters and plants. Having then collected him from the
water and plants, he (the performer of the Sânnâyya) causes him to be
reproduced from out of the libations; and he (Soma, the moon), being
reproduced from the libations, becomes visible in the western sky.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:16">1:6:4:16</span></span>16. Now
it is only when that food of the gods is unfailing that it comes back
(to men): for him, therefore, who knows this, there is unfailing food in
this, and imperishable righteousness in yonder, world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:17">1:6:4:17</span></span>17.
Thus during that night (of new moon) food moves away from the gods and
comes to this world. Now the gods were desirous as to how that (food)
might (be made to) come back to them; how it might not perish away from
them. For this they put their trust in those who prepare the libation of
sweet and sour milk (sânnâyya), thinking, 'when they have prepared it,
they will offer it to us.' And, verily, in him, who knows this, both his
own kin and strangers put their trust; for in him, who attains to the
highest rank, people indeed put their trust.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:18">1:6:4:18</span></span>18. Now
the one that burns there (viz. the sun)

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

is, assuredly, no other than Indra, and that moon is no other than
V*ri*tra. But the former is of a nature hostile to the latter, and for
this reason, though this one (the moon, V*ri*tra) had previously (to the
night of new moon) risen at a great distance from him (the sun, Indra),
he now swims towards him and enters into his open mouth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:19">1:6:4:19</span></span>19.
Having swallowed him, he (the sun) rises; and that (other) one is not
seen either in the east or in the west. And, verily, he who knows this,
swallows his spiteful enemy, and of him they say, 'He alone exists, his
enemies exist not <span id="fr_421"></span>[1](#fn_418.md).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:20">1:6:4:20</span></span>20.
Having sucked him empty, he throws him out; and the latter, thus sucked
out, is seen in the western sky, and again increases; he again increases
to serve that (sun) as food: and verily if the spiteful enemy of one who
knows this, thrives either by trade or in any other way, he thrives
again and again in order to serve him as food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:4:21">1:6:4:21</span></span>21. Now
some people offer (the Sânnâyya) to (Indra under the name of) 'Mahendra'
(the great Indra), arguing, 'Before the slaying of V*ri*tra he was
Indra, it is true; but after slaying V*ri*tra he became Mahendra, even
as (a râgan, or king, becomes) a Mahârâ*g*a after obtaining the victory:
hence (the Sânnâyya should be offered) to Mahendra.' Let him,
nevertheless, offer it to 'Indra;' for Indra he was before the slaying
of V*ri*tra, and Indra he is after slaying V*ri*tra: therefore let him
offer it to 'Indra <span id="fr_422"></span>[2](#fn_419.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_400"></span>[175:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_403.md) Parâ*h*
parâvata*h*, literally to the most distant distances, 'zu den fernsten
Fernen.'

<span id="fn_401"></span>[175:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_404.md) Hira*n*yastûpa, of
the family of the Aṅgiras, is the reputed author (or seer) of the hymns
Rig-veda I, 31-35; IX, 4; 69. Of these, I, 32 and 33, which celebrate
the exploits of Indra, seem to have been especially prized.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[176:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_405.md) That is, as would
seem, the benefactor, or the treasure (dhanarûpa, Sâya*n*a) of the gods.
Indra is the chief of the Vasus. Indra being so beneficent and important
a personage, it was, according to Sâya*n*a, worth Agni's while to stay
with him. Possibly also a play on the word Vasu, and vas, 'to dwell,' is
intended here.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[176:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_406.md) Thus Sâya*n*a; but
it probably means, 'he is staying at a home, or at home (amâ) to-day.'

<span id="fn_404"></span>[176:3](sbe1229.htm#fr_407.md) The identification
of the Soma (plant and juice) with the moon already occurs in some of
the hymns of the Rig-veda, all of which, however, probably belong to the
later ones. According to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, the
identification was probably suggested by the circumstance that indu,
'drop, spark,' applies both to the Soma and the moon. Rig-veda X, 85, 3
says that of that Soma which the priests know, no one ever eats.'

<span id="fn_405"></span>[177:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_408.md) Viz. with the
waters and plants (or, he stays at home).

<span id="fn_406"></span>[177:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_409.md) It should be borne
in mind that Soma is masculine in Sanskrit.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[177:3](sbe1229.htm#fr_410.md) In Taitt. S. II, 5,
3, 2 seq. the corresponding story is applied directly to the Sânnâyya.
In consequence of the struggle with V*ri*tra., Indra lost his energy,
which fell to the earth and produced plants and shrubs. He thereupon
complained to Pra*g*âpati, who bade the cattle collect (sam-nî) it again
by browsing the plants and shrubs. It was then milked out from them, and
as the milk did not agree with Indra, it was boiled, and as it still did
not satisfy Indra, it was mixed with sour milk.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[177:4](sbe1229.htm#fr_411.md) Na mayi *s*rayate,
'literally it does not stay in me' = na tish*th*ati, na sâtmyam
bha*g*ate, Sâya*n*a. The author here (as in I, 8, I, 17) connects, or
confounds, the verb *s*ri with *s*râ, 'to cook, make done,'--hence, 'it
does not boil in me;' the milk being warm, or, as it were, boiled, when
it comes from the cow, see II, 2, 4, 15. Hence also boiled milk is mixed
with the Soma.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[178:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_412.md) The author here
endeavours to establish some connection between the Sânnâyya (or
offering of sweet and sour milk to Indra, which may take the place of
the second sacrificial cake offered, at the new-moon sacrifice, to Indra
and Agni) and the Soma libations. Sâya*n*a refers to the passage Taitt.
Br. I, 4, 7, 6-7, where it is stated that for the morning libation the
Soma is to be mixed with boiled milk, for the mid-day libation with sour
milk, and for the third (or evening) libation with sour milk that is
partly changed into butter (nîtami*s*ra).

<span id="fn_410"></span>[178:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_413.md) Âpyâyeta. On the
strengthening or increasing (âpyâyanam) of the Soma-plant by sprinkling
it with water before the juice is extracted, see III, 4, 3, 12 seq.
Sâya*n*a seems to take the passage thus: 'In the same way as the Soma
would make strong (? or become strong), so also the sânnâyyam destroys
that evil, the jaundice, in those who drink it.'

<span id="fn_411"></span>[178:3](sbe1229.htm#fr_414.md) By the admixture of
milk the Soma-juice loses its brownish colour, and is therefore
apparently considered to produce the same effect in those who drink the
mixture.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[178:4](sbe1229.htm#fr_415.md) The preparation of
the sânnâyya, as it is now practised by priests in Western India, is
thus described by Haug (Ait. Br. II, p. 443): <span id="page_179">p.
179</span> 'The Adhvaryu takes the milk from three cows called Gaṅgâ,
Yamuna, and Sarasvatî, on the morning and evening, and gives it to the
Âgnîdhra. Half the milk is first drawn from the udder of each of the
three cows under the recital of mantras; then the same is done silently.
The milk is taken from these cows on the evening of the new-moon day,
and on the morning of the following day, the so-called Pratipad (the
first day of the month). The milk drawn on the evening is made hot, and
lime-juice poured over it to make it sour; whereupon it is hung up. The
fresh milk of the following morning is then mixed with it, and both are
sacrificed along with the Puro*d*â*s*a. Only he who has already
performed the Agnish*t*oma is allowed to sacrifice the Sânnâyya at the
Dar*s*apûr*n*ima ish*t*i. (Oral information.)' In Vâ*g*. S. I, 4 (*S*at.
Br. I, 7, 1, 17; Katy. IV, 2, 25, 26) the names of the three cows are
given as Vi*s*vâyu, Vi*s*vakarman, and Vi*s*vadhâyus, unless these are
intended merely for epithets or mystic names. Cf. [p.
188](sbe1230.htm#page_188.md) note; Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 232. Instead of
the lime-juice, mentioned by Haug as used for rennet, Katy. IV, 2, 33
prescribes that the milk remaining from the Agnihotra of the preceding
evening, and since become sour, should be used.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[179:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_416.md) Thus Taitt. S. II,
5, 5, 1.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[179:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_417.md) Atrântare*n*a; atra
vishaye antare*n*a madhye, Sâya*n*a; ? within this our range of hearing;
or, in the course of the present ceremony.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[180:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_418.md) See I, 6, 3, 17.

<span id="fn_416"></span>[180:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_419.md) Viz. in the form of
Soma, i.e. the moon, still shining in the heavens during the night
preceding the new moon.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[180:3](sbe1229.htm#fr_420.md) Who, as we saw,
resides in the plants and waters at the time of new moon and
consequently in the milk used for the Sânnâyya. If, however, one were to
enter upon the fast (and hence on the <span id="page_181">p. 181</span>
sacrifice) previously to the new moon, he would be offering mere milk,
not imbued with, and not liable to change into, Soma, and therefore
unfit for the gods.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[182:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_421.md) With this
explanation of the disappearance of the moon may be compared the later
notion of the sun and moon being swallowed by the demon Râhu, at the
time of the eclipses.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[182:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_422.md) Kâty. IV, 2, 10
leaves it optional whether the libation of mixed <span id="page_183">p.
183</span> sweet and sour milk is to be offered to Indra or to Mahendra.
According to IV, 5, 25, however, such option seems to be permitted only
so far as the first performance is concerned, after which one is
apparently bound to go on offering during the rest of one's life to
whichever deity one has chosen at the beginning. Taitt. S. II, 5, 4, 4,
lays it down as the rule that only a gata*s*rî (one who has reached the
highest grade of prosperity), viz. a brâhma*n*a versed in the three
Vedas (*s*u*s*ruvân = vedatrayâbhi*gñ*a, Sâya*n*a, the head of a village
(grâma*n*î), and a râ*g*anya, can make offering to Mahendra, since he is
their special deity. Others, however, may do the same, after offering
the sânnâyyam to Indra for a whole year, and on the expiration of it a
rice-cake on eight potsherds to Agni, as the Keeper of Vows.
