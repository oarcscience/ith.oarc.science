### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:2:1">1:6:2:1</span></span>1.
Verily, by means of the sacrifice the gods made that conquest (of the
world of heaven). When they had conquered, they said, 'How may this
(celestial region) be made unattainable by men?' They then sipped the
sap of the sacrifice, as bees would suck out honey; and having drained
the sacrifice and effaced the traces of it with the (sacrificial)
post <span id="fr_377"></span>[2](#fn_374), they

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

concealed themselves: and because they effaced (ayopayan, viz. the
sacrifice) with it, therefore it is called yûpa (sacrificial post). Now
this was heard by the *Ri*shis:

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:2:2">1:6:2:2</span></span>2.
'Verily, by means of the sacrifice the gods gained this conquest. When
they had conquered, they said, "How may this (celestial region) be made
unattainable by men?" They then sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees
would suck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and effaced the
traces of it with the (sacrificial) post, they concealed themselves.'
They (the *Ri*shis) thereupon set about searching for it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:2:3">1:6:2:3</span></span>3. They
went on praising and toiling; for by (religious) toil, the gods indeed
gained what they wished to gain, and (so did) the *Ri*shis. Now whether
it be that the gods caused it (the sacrifice) to attract (or, peep forth
to) them, or whether they took to it of their own accord, they said,
'Come, let us go to the place whence the gods obtained possession of the
world of heaven!' They went about saying (to one another), 'What
attracts? What attracts <span id="fr_378"></span>[1](#fn_375)?' and came
upon the sacrificial cake which had become a tortoise and was creeping
about. Then they all thought, 'This surely must be the sacrifice!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:2:4">1:6:2:4</span></span>4. They
said, 'Stand still for the A*s*vins! stand still for Sarasvatî! stand
still for Indra!' still it

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

crept on;--'Stand still for Agni!' at this it stopped. Having then
enveloped it in fire (Agni), knowing, as they did, that it had stopped
for Agni, they Offered it up entirely, for it was an oblation to the
gods. Then the sacrifice pleased them <span
id="fr_379"></span>[1](#fn_376); they produced it, they spread it. And
this same sacrifice is taught by the former to the later; the father
(teaches it) to his son when he is a student (brahma*k*ârin).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:2:5">1:6:2:5</span></span>5. Now
that (cake), which caused the sacrifice to attract (or, appear to) them,
first (puras) bestowed (dâ*s*) it upon them: hence it is (called)
purodâ*s*a, for purodâ*s*a, doubtless, is the same as purodâ*s*a <span
id="fr_380"></span>[2](#fn_377). This same cake on eight potsherds for
Agni is indispensable on both occasions (at the new- and full-moon
ceremonies).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:2:6">1:6:2:6</span></span>6. That
(cake for Agni) does not constitute the (special) sacrificial food
(havis) either at the full-moon, or at the new-moon, sacrifice; since
the one for Agni and Soma constitutes the havis at the full-moon, and
the Sânnâyya <span id="fr_381"></span>[3](#fn_378) at the new-moon
sacrifice. That one (for Agni) constitutes rather the regular (or,
corresponding) sacrifice on both occasions, and because of its fearing
lest it should become detached from the sacrifice, it is offered up at
the beginning of both the full-moon and the new-moon sacrifice: this is
the reason why it is offered at this particular time.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:2:7">1:6:2:7</span></span>7. And if
any one (householder) were to resort to him (the Adhvaryu) and say,
'Perform an ish*t*i for me!' let him perform it. Whatever desire the
*Ri*shis entertained when they performed that sacrifice, that desire of
theirs was accomplished; and accordingly whatever desire he (the
sacrificer) entertains in having this sacrifice performed, that desire
of his is accomplished. For whatever deity sacrificial food is taken, to
that deity they offer it up in the fire (Agni);--and if he is about to
offer it up in the fire, why should he announce it to another deity? To
Agni alone therefore (it is announced).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:2:8">1:6:2:8</span></span>8. Agni
(the fire), assuredly, represents all the deities, since it is in the
fire that they make offering to all deities: to Agni alone therefore (he
should announce it), since he thereby has recourse to all the deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:2:9">1:6:2:9</span></span>9. Agni,
assuredly, is the safest <span id="fr_382"></span>[1](#fn_379) among the
gods: let him then have recourse to him whom he considers the safest
among the gods, and therefore (announce the sacrifice) to Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:2:10">1:6:2:10</span></span>10.
Agni, assuredly, is the most tender-hearted of gods: let him then have
recourse to him whom he considers the most tender-hearted of gods, and
therefore (announce the sacrifice) to Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:2:11">1:6:2:11</span></span>11.
Agni, assuredly, is the nearest of the gods: let him then have recourse
to him whom he considers as the nearest of those to be approached, and
therefore (let him announce the sacrifice) to Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:6:2:12">1:6:2:12</span></span>12. If
(beside the full-moon sacrifice) he perform an ish*t*i (with a view to
the accomplishment of some

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

special desire) <span id="fr_383"></span>[1](sbe1228.htm#fn_380), let
him recite seventeen kindling verses; (and in that case) he utters the
offering-prayer (yâ*g*yâ) in a low voice, for this is the characteristic
form of an ish*t*i; the yâ*g*yâ and the anuvâkyâ should contain the word
'head <span id="fr_384"></span>[2](sbe1228.htm#fn_381);' the two
butter-portions should be offered to the V*ri*tra-slayer (Indra); and
the two sa*m*yâ*g*yâs <span id="fr_385"></span>[3](sbe1228.htm#fn_382)
should be in the virâ*g* metre.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_373"></span>[160:1](sbe1226.htm#fr_376) Because he (? as
lord of creatures) represents all the deities, and one cannot say 'he is
such or such a one,' Sâya*n*a. Cf. also I, 1, 1, 12.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[160:2](sbe1227.htm#fr_377) Yûpena yopâyitvâ,
literally 'having made it level by means of the yûpa,' =
yûpenâ*kkh*âdya, 'having covered it over with the yûpa,' Sâya*n*a (cf.
also on Rig-veda I, 104, 4). For other versions of the same myth, cf.
Ait. Br. II, 1 \['they debarred them (ayopayan, viz. the men and
*Ri*shis from the sacrificial knowledge) by means of the yûpa,' Haug\];
Taitt. S. VI, 3, 4, 7; 5, 3, 1. <span id="page_161">p. 161</span> The
legend is intended to supply, by means of a fanciful etymology, a
symbolical meaning for the yûpa or sacrificial post to which the victim
is tied.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[161:1](sbe1227.htm#fr_378) Kim praro*k*ate =
'what thinkest thou?' Sâya*n*a. The primary meaning of pra-ru*k* is 'to
shine forth.' Here it has apparently to be taken in the double sense of
'to peep forth, to appear,' and 'to please.' The German 'einleuchten'
(St. Petersburg Dictionary) approaches more nearly to the original.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[162:1](sbe1227.htm#fr_379) Or 'appeared to
them, shone forth to them,' prâro*k*ata; see preceding note.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[162:2](sbe1227.htm#fr_380) In the compound
puro*d*âsa or puro*d*â*s* the original dental d has been changed to the
lingual *d*, apparently through the influence of the preceding r.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[162:3](sbe1227.htm#fr_381) See I, 6, 4, 9. One
would expect the Sânnâyya (to Indra) or the cake to Indra-Agni. The
full-moon offering is sacred to Agni-Soma: and the new-moon offering to
Indra-Agni; see I, 8, 3, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[163:1](sbe1227.htm#fr_382) Addhâtamâm, adv.,
literally 'most surely;' according to Sâya*n*a = ati*s*ayena
pratyakshaphaladam, 'pre-eminently a giver of perceptible benefits.'
