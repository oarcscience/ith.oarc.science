### THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:1">2:3:1:1</span></span>1. The
Agnihotra, doubtless, is the Sun. It is because he rose in front (agre)
of that offering <span id="fr_744"></span>[1](#fn_740.md), that the
Agnihotra is the Sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:2">2:3:1:2</span></span>2. When
he offers in the evening after sunset, he does so thinking, 'I will
offer, while he is here, who is this (offering);' and when he offers in
the morning before sunrise, he does so thinking, 'I will offer, while he
is here, who is this (offering):' and for this reason, they say, the
Agnihotra is the Sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:3">2:3:1:3</span></span>3. And
when he sets, then he, as an embryo, enters that womb, the fire; and
along with him thus becoming an embryo, all these creatures become
embryos; for, being coaxed, they lie down contented <span
id="fr_745"></span>[2](#fn_741.md).

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The reason, then,
why the night envelops that (sun), is that embryos also are, as it were,
enveloped.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:4">2:3:1:4</span></span>4. Now
when he offers in the evening after sunset, he offers for the good of
that (sun) in the embryo state, he benefits that embryo; and since he
offers for the good of that (sun) in the embryo state, therefore embryos
here live without taking food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:5">2:3:1:5</span></span>5. And
when he offers in the morning before sunrise, then he produces that
(sun-child) and, having become a light, it rises shining. But,
assuredly, it would not rise, were he not to make that offering: this is
why he performs that offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:6">2:3:1:6</span></span>6. Even
as a snake frees itself from its skin, so does it (the sun-child) free
itself from the night, from evil: and, verily, whosoever, knowing this,
offers the Agnihotra, he frees himself from all evil, even as a snake
frees itself from its skin; and after his birth all these creatures are
born; for they are set free according to their inclination.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:7">2:3:1:7</span></span>7. Then,
as to his taking out the Âhavanîya (from the Gârhapatya) before the
setting of the sun;--the rays, doubtless, are all those gods; and what
highest light there is, that, indeed, is either Pra*g*âpati or Indra.
Now all the gods approach the house of him who performs the Agnihotra:
but whosesoever (offering) they approach before the fire has been taken
out, from that the gods turn away, and he fails in it; and after the
failure of that (offering) from which the gods turn away, people say,
that, whether one knows it or not, the sun went down on account of that
(fire) not having been taken out.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:8">2:3:1:8</span></span>8. And
another reason why he takes out the Âhavanîya before the setting of the
sun, is this. In like manner as, when one's better comes to visit

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

one, he would honour him by trimming his house, so here: for whosesoever
(offering) they approach, after the fire has been taken out, his
Âhavanîya (house) they enter, in his Âhavanîya they repose.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:9">2:3:1:9</span></span>9. Now
when he offers in the evening after the sun has set, he thereby offers
to them after they have entered his fire-house; and when he offers in
the morning before sunrise, he offers to them before they go away.
Therefore Âsuri said, 'The Agnihotra of those who offer after sunrise we
regard as useless <span id="fr_746"></span>[1](#fn_742.md): it is as if one
were to take food to an empty dwelling.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:10">2:3:1:10</span></span>10.
That which affords (the means of) subsistence is of two kinds; namely,
either rooted or rootless. On both of these, which belong to the gods,
men subsist. Now cattle are rootless and plants are rooted. From the
rootless cattle eating the rooted plants and drinking water, that juice
is produced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:11">2:3:1:11</span></span>11. Now
when he offers in the evening after sunset, he does so thinking, 'I will
offer to the gods of this life-giving juice: we subsist on this which
belongs to them.' And when he afterwards takes his evening meal, he eats
what remains of the offering, and whereof oblative portions (bali) have
been distributed all round <span id="fr_747"></span>[2](#fn_743.md); for he
who performs the Agnihotra eats only what remains of the offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:12">2:3:1:12</span></span>12. And
when he offers in the morning before sunrise, he does so thinking, 'I
will offer to the gods of this life-giving juice: we subsist on this
which belongs to them.' And when he afterwards takes his meal in the
day-time, he eats what remains of the

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

offering, and whereof oblative portions have been distributed all round;
for he who performs the Agnihotra eats only what remains of the
offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:13">2:3:1:13</span></span>13.
Here now they say,--All other sacrifices come to an end, but the
Agnihotra does not come to an end. Although that which lasts for twelve
years is indeed limited, this (Agnihotra) is nevertheless unlimited,
since, when one has offered in the evening, he knows that he will offer
in the morning; and when one has offered in the morning, he knows that
he will again offer in the evening. Hence that Agnihotra is unlimited,
and in consequence of this its unlimitedness, creatures are here born
unlimited. And, verily, he who thus knows the unlimitedness of the
Agnihotra, is himself born unlimited in prosperity and offspring.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:14">2:3:1:14</span></span>14.
Having milked <span id="fr_748"></span>[1](#fn_744) he puts that (milk.md)
on (the Gârhapatya fire), because it has to be cooked. Here now they
say, 'When it rises to the brim, then we shall offer it!' He must not
however let it rise to the brim, since he would burn it, if he were to
let it rise to the brim; and unproductive indeed is burnt seed: he must
not, therefore, let it rise to the brim.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:15">2:3:1:15</span></span>15. He
should not offer it without having put it on the fire; for since this is
Agni's seed, therefore it is hot (*sri*ta, 'cooked'); and by putting it
on the

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

fire, it is indeed heated: let him, therefore, offer (of the milk) only
after he has put it on the fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:16">2:3:1:16</span></span>16. He
illumines it (with a burning straw) <span
id="fr_749"></span>[1](#fn_745.md) in order that he may know when it is
done. He then pours some water to it (with the sruva), both for the sake
of appeasement, and in order to supplement the juice. For when it rains
here; then plants spring up; and in consequence of the plants being
eaten and the water drunk, this juice is produced: hence it is in order
to supplement the juice (that he pours water to it); and therefore, if
it should happen to him to have to drink pure milk, let him have one
drop of water poured into it, both for the sake of appeasement, and in
order to supplement the juice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:17">2:3:1:17</span></span>17.
Thereupon he ladles four times (milk with the sruva into the Agnihotra
ladle <span id="fr_750"></span>[2](#fn_746).md), for in a fourfold way was
that milk supplied <span id="fr_751"></span>[3](#fn_747.md). He then takes
a kindling-stick (samidh), and hastes up (to the Âhavanîya, with the
ladle) to make the libation on the burning (stick) <span
id="fr_752"></span>[4](#fn_748.md). He offers the first libation

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (pûrvâhuti)
without putting down (the spoon) beside (the fire, on the grass-bunch).
For, were he to put it down beside (the fire), it would be as if, in
taking food to somebody, one were to put it down on one's way thither.
But when (he makes the libation) without previously putting it down, it
is as if, in taking food to somebody, one puts it down only after taking
it to him. The second (libation he then makes) after putting it down: he
thereby makes these two (libations) of various vigour. Now these two:
libations are mind and speech: hence he thereby separates mind and
speech from each other; and thus mind and speech, even while one and the
same (samâna), are still distinct (nânâ).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:18">2:3:1:18</span></span>18.
Twice he offers in the fire, twice he wipes (the spout of the spoon),
twice he eats (of the milk), and four times he ladles <span
id="fr_753"></span>[1](#fn_749);--these are ten (acts.md), for

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

of ten syllables consists the virâ*g* stanza, and the sacrifice is
virâ*g* (shining): he thereby converts the sacrifice into the virâ*g*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:19">2:3:1:19</span></span>19. Now
what he offers up in the fire, that he offers to the gods; and thereby
the gods are (admitted to the sacrifice) <span
id="fr_754"></span>[1](#fn_750). And what he wipes off (the spoons.md),
that he offers to the fathers and plants; and thereby the fathers and
plants are (admitted). And what he eats after offering, that he offers
to men; and thereby men are (admitted).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:20">2:3:1:20</span></span>20.
Verily, the creatures that are not allowed to take part in the sacrifice
are forlorn; to those creatures that are not forlorn he thus offers a
share at the opening of the sacrifice; and thus beasts (cattle) are made
to share in it along with (men), since beasts are behind men <span
id="fr_755"></span>[2](#fn_751.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:21">2:3:1:21</span></span>21. On
this point Yâ*gñ*avalkya said, 'It (the Agnihotra) must not be looked
upon as a (havis-) sacrifice, but as a domestic sacrifice (pâkaya*gñ*a);
for while in any other (havis-)sacrifice he pours into the fire all that
he cuts off (from the sacrificial dish and puts) into the offering
spoon,--here, after offering and stepping outside <span
id="fr_756"></span>[3](#fn_752), he sips water and licks out (the milk.md);
and this indeed (is a characteristic) of the domestic offering.' This
then is the animal

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

characteristic <span id="fr_757"></span>[1](#fn_753.md) of that
(Agnihotra), for the domestic offering pertains to beasts (or cattle).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:22">2:3:1:22</span></span>22. Now
the first of these libations, doubtless, is the same as that which
Pra*g*âpati offered in the beginning <span
id="fr_758"></span>[2](#fn_754); and as those (gods.md) thereupon continued
(to sacrifice) <span id="fr_759"></span>[3](#fn_755.md),--namely, Agni,
that blower (Vâyu), and Sûrya,--so this second libation is offered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:23">2:3:1:23</span></span>23.
What first libation (pûrvâhuti) is made, that is the deity of the
Agnihotra <span id="fr_760"></span>[4](#fn_756), and to that (deity.md) it
is accordingly offered; and what second one (uttarâhuti) is made, that
indeed is equivalent to the Svish*t*ak*ri*t (Agni, the maker of good
offering); whence he offers it on the north part (of the fire), since
that is the region of the Svish*t*ak*ri*t <span
id="fr_761"></span>[5](#fn_757.md). Moreover, this second libation is made
in order to effect a pairing, for a couple forms a productive pair.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:24">2:3:1:24</span></span>24.
These two libations, then, form a duad: the past and the future, the
born and the to-be-born, the actual <span
id="fr_762"></span>[6](#fn_758.md) and the hope, the to-day and the
morrow,--(these are) after the manner of that duad.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:25">2:3:1:25</span></span>25. The
past is the self, for certain is that which is past, and certain also is
that which is a self. The future, on the other hand, is progeny; for
uncertain is that which is to be, and uncertain also is progeny.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:26">2:3:1:26</span></span>26. The
born is the self, for certain is that which is born, and certain also is
the self. The to-be-born,

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

on the other hand, is progeny; for uncertain is what is to be born, and
uncertain also is progeny.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:27">2:3:1:27</span></span>27. The
actual is the self, for certain is what is actual, and certain also is
the self. And hope is progeny, for uncertain is hope, and uncertain also
is progeny.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:28">2:3:1:28</span></span>28. The
to-day is the self, for certain is what is to-day, and certain also is
the self. The morrow is progeny, for uncertain is the morrow, and
uncertain also is progeny.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:29">2:3:1:29</span></span>29. Now
that first libation is offered on account of the self: he offers it with
a sacred text, for certain is the sacred text, and certain also is the
self. And that second one is offered on account of progeny: he offers it
silently, for uncertain is what (is done) silently, and uncertain also
is progeny.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:30">2:3:1:30</span></span>30.
\[In the evening\] he offers (the first libation), with the text (Vâ*g*.
S. III, 9, 10), 'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Svâhâ!' and in
the morning with, 'Sûrya (the sun) is the light, the light is Sûrya,
Svâhâ!' Thus offering is made with the truth; for, truly, when the sun
goes down, then Agni (fire) is the light, and when the sun rises, then
Sûrya is the light; and whatever is offered with the truth, that,
indeed, goes to the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:31">2:3:1:31</span></span>31.
Here now Takshan recited for Âru*n*i <span
id="fr_763"></span>[1](#fn_759.md), who wished to obtain holy lustre
(brahmavar*k*asa, inspired nature), 'Agni is lustre, light is
lustre;'--'Sûrya is lustre, light is lustre.' Holy lustre, therefore, he
obtains whosoever, knowing this, thus offers the Agnihotra.

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:32">2:3:1:32</span></span>32.
That (other text), however, has the characteristic form of generation.
In saying, 'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Svâhâ!' he encloses
that seed, the light, on both sides with the deity; and the seed, thus
enclosed on both sides, is brought forth: thus enclosing it on both
sides he causes it to be brought forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:33">2:3:1:33</span></span>33. And
when, in the morning, he says, 'Sûrya is the light, the light is Sûrya,
Svâhâ!' he encloses that seed, the light, on both sides with the deity,
and the seed, thus enclosed on both sides, is brought forth: thus
enclosing it on both sides he causes it to be brought forth; and this,
indeed, is the characteristic form of generation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:34">2:3:1:34</span></span>34. But
*G*îvala *K*ailaki said <span id="fr_764"></span>[1](#fn_760.md), 'Âru*n*i
merely causes conception to take place, not birth: let him therefore
offer with that (text, in par. 32) in the evening.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:35">2:3:1:35</span></span>35.
Then, in the morning, by the text, "The light is Sûrya, Sûrya is the
light," he places that seed, the light, outside by means of the deity;
and the seed thus brought outside he causes to be born.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:36">2:3:1:36</span></span>36.
They also say, 'In the evening he offers Sûrya in Agni, and in the
morning he offers Agni in Sûrya <span id="fr_765"></span>[2](#fn_761.md).'
Such, indeed, is the case with those who offer after sunrise; for when
the sun sets then Agni is the light, and when the sun rises then Sûrya
is the light. Here no offence is committed on his (the sacrificer's)
part; but an offence is indeed committed where offering is not made
distinctly to that deity (viz. Agni or Sûrya resp.), which is the deity
of the Agnihotra.

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He says <span
id="fr_766"></span>[1](#fn_762.md), 'Agni is the light, the light is Agni,
Svâhâ!' and not, 'To Agni Svâhâ!' and in the morning, 'Sûrya is the
light, the light is Sûrya, Svâhâ!' and not, 'To Sûrya Svâhâ!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:37">2:3:1:37</span></span>37. He
may also offer (in the evening) with this text (Vâ*g*. S. III, 10),
'Along with the divine Savit*ri*--,' whereby it (the sacrifice) becomes
possessed of Savit*ri* for his impulsion; '--along with the Night,
wedded to Indra--,' whereby he effects a union with the night, and makes
it (the sacrifice) possessed of Indra, for Indra is the deity of the
sacrifice; '--may Agni graciously accept! Svâhâ!' whereby he offers to
Agni in a direct manner.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:38">2:3:1:38</span></span>38. And
in the morning with, 'Along with the divine Savit*ri*--,' whereby it
becomes possessed of Savit*ri* for his impulsion; '--along with the
Dawn, wedded to Indra,' or 'along with the Day . . . .--,' whereby he
effects a union either with the day or the dawn <span
id="fr_767"></span>[2](#fn_763), and makes it (the sacrifice.md) possessed
of Indra; for Indra is the deity of sacrifice; '--may Sûrya graciously
accept! Svâhâ!' whereby he offers to Sûrya directly: hence he may offer
in this way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:1:39">2:3:1:39</span></span>39.
They then spake, 'Who shall offer this unto us?'--'The priest
(brâhma*n*a)!'--'Priest, offer this  unto us! What is to be my share
then? The residue of the Agnihotra!' Now what he leaves in

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

the ladle, that is the residue of the Agnihotra; and what remains in the
pot, is as (the rice for oblations which) one takes out from the
enclosed part (of the cart) <span id="fr_768"></span>[1](#fn_764.md). And
if any one is to drink it, at least none but a Brâhman must drink
it <span id="fr_769"></span>[2](#fn_765.md): for it is put on the fire (and
thereby consecrated), and hence none but a Brâhman must drink it.

ceremonies preceding those above, see I, 3, 3, 13 seq. According to
Kâty. IV, 14, 1 he has the Agnihotra cow--standing south of the
sacrificial ground and facing the east or north--milked by anybody
except a Sûdra. The vessel to be used is of earthenware, and must have
been made by an Ârya. The Adhvaryu then takes the vessel, and having
entered the Âhavanîya house by the east door and passed over to the
Gârhapatya, puts it there on coals previously shifted northwards from
the fire.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[331:1](sbe1248.htm#fr_749.md) According to Kâty.
IV, 14, 5 the Adhvaryu illumines the milk with a burning straw; pours
some water to it with the sruva or dipping-spoon; then illumines it once
more; and lifts up the pot three several times, putting it down each
time further north of the fire. Thereupon he warms the two spoons; and
wipes them with his hand; and having warmed them once more, he says to
the sacrificer, 'I ladle!' The latter, while standing, replies, 'Om,
ladle!'

<span id="fn_746"></span>[331:2](sbe1248.htm#fr_750.md) For the
Agnihotra-hava*n*î, or offering-spoon (sru*k*), used at the morning and
evening libation, and made of Vikankata wood (Flacourtia Sapida), see
[p. 67](sbe1211.htm#page_67), note [2](sbe1212.htm#fn_207.md). In the case
of those who make five cuttings from the havis (pa*ñk*âvattin, cf. [p.
192](sbe1231.htm#page_192) note.md) he takes five sruva-fuls. Kâty. IV, 14,
10, Comm.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[331:4](sbe1248.htm#fr_752.md) While holding a
billet or kindling-stick (samidh) over the (handle of) the milk-ladle,
he \[first holds the latter close over the Gârhapatya fire, and
thereupon\] takes it to the Âhavanîya, keeping <span id="page_332">p.
332</span> it on a level with his mouth, except in the middle between
the two fires, where he lowers it for a moment to the level of his
navel. He then crouches down \[bending his right knee, and looking
eastwards, by the north-west corner of the Âhavanîya\], puts the billet
on \[the centre of\] the fire, and makes the first libation (pûrvâhuti)
on the burning stick (see the formula, par. 30. The sacrificer, as
usual, pronounces the dedicatory formula, viz. 'This to Agni!' and,
'This to Sûrya!' respectively). Thereupon he lays down the ladle on the
kûr*k*a \[a grass-bunch, placed behind the Âhavanîya fire-place, to
serve as a seat, and to wipe the hands on; according to others, a flat
piece of Vara*n*a wood\], then takes it up again and silently makes the
second libation (uttarâhuti) on the north part of the fire. Kâty. IV,
14, 12-17 with Schol.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[332:1](sbe1248.htm#fr_753.md) He ladles four
sruva-fuls of milk into the Agnihotra ladle, and makes in the Âhavanîya
fire two libations from this milk (so as to leave the larger quantity in
the ladle to be eaten). He then wipes twice the spout of the ladle. \[In
each of the two other fires he thereupon makes likewise two libations
with the sruva, of one spoonful each.\] The milk left in the ladle he
eats, on the completion of the six libations, by twice taking it out
with his ring-finger.

to be supplied here from the next paragraph.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[333:2](sbe1248.htm#fr_755.md) Instead of this
paragraph, the Kâ*n*va text reads: 'Behind men are beasts; behind the
gods are birds, plants, trees, and whatever else exists here. Thus he
makes these creatures share in the sacrifice, those that are not forlorn
here.' Compare I, 5, 2, 4.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[333:3](sbe1248.htm#fr_756.md) Uts*ri*pya is
variously explained by the commentators here and on Kâty. IV, 14, 27, as
'having gone out,' or 'having slowly moved forward,' or 'having risen,'
or 'having poured out (the milk).'

<span id="fn_753"></span>[334:1](sbe1248.htm#fr_757.md) Pa*s*avya*m*
rûpam,--that is to say, its relation to the pa*s*u or animal sacrifice;
and hence also to the i*d*â at the havirya*gñ*a; cf. I, 7, 4, 19.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[334:2](sbe1248.htm#fr_758.md) See II, 2, 4, 4
seq.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[334:3](sbe1248.htm#fr_759.md) See II, 2, 4, 18.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[334:4](sbe1248.htm#fr_760.md) That is to say, it
represents the chief offering at the havirya*gñ*a, which is followed by
the (oblation to Agni) Svish*t*ak*ri*t. See I, 7, 2, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[334:5](sbe1248.htm#fr_761.md) See I, 7, 3, 20.

<span id="fn_758"></span>[334:6](sbe1248.htm#fr_762.md) Âgatam, 'what has
arrived or come to pass,' 'the accomplished.'

<span id="fn_759"></span>[335:1](sbe1248.htm#fr_763.md) The Kâ*n*va text
has,--Here now Daksha said to Âru*n*i, 'For one wishing to obtain
brahmavar*k*asa one should offer with this text, "Agni is lustre, light
is lustre;"--"Sûrya is lustre, light is lustre:" a brahmavar*k*asin,
then, he becomes for whomsoever they so sacrifice.'

<span id="fn_760"></span>[336:1](sbe1248.htm#fr_764.md) have made
*G*îvala's speech extend to the end of par. 35, as is done, no doubt
correctly, in the Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[336:2](sbe1248.htm#fr_765.md) The Kâ*n*va
has,--Now they say, 'In the evening they offer Agni in Sûrya, and in the
morning they offer Sûrya in Agni.' But see the formulas (par. 30), where
'light' is to be taken as Sûrya and Agni respectively.

<span id="fn_762"></span>[337:1](sbe1248.htm#fr_766.md) Here the Kâ*n*va
text begins a new paragraph. The author's object seems to be to show
that those who offer the Agnihotra after sunrise, commit a mistake in
not offering to Sûrya unmistakably; for while before sunrise, Sûrya is
still reposing in Agni, and the oblation, in being poured into the fire,
is consequently made to Sûrya directly, those offering after sunrise
should rather use the formula 'To Sûrya Svâhâ!' Cf. paragraph 9.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[337:2](sbe1248.htm#fr_767.md) Instead of 'ahnâ*m*
voshasâ*m* vâ,' I adopt 'ahnâ voshasâ va,' from the Kâ*n*va reading
'ushasâ vâhnâ vâ.'

<span id="fn_764"></span>[338:1](sbe1248.htm#fr_768.md) Yathâ parî*n*aho
nirvaped evam tat. The Kâ*n*va text has: Yathâ (yayâ MS.) kosh*th*â
parî*n*aho vâ nirmimîtaiva*m* tat.

<span id="fn_765"></span>[338:2](sbe1248.htm#fr_769.md) Or, 'anybody may
drink it, but none but a Brâhman may drink it.' According to the Schol.
on Katy. IV, 14, II, the milk which is left in the pot may be drunk by a
Brâhman, but by no one else; not even in his own house is a Kshatriya or
Vai*s*ya allowed to drink it.
