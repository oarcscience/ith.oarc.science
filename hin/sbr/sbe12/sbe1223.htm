[The Hot<I>ri</I> continues], 'May Agni, the priest (hot<I>ri</I>), know (undertake) Agni's priestly duty (hautram),'--thereby he says 'may Agni, as Hot<I>ri</I>, know this!' 'Agni's priestly duty' he says, because it is his duty that he must know;--'that means of salvation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_343"></A><A HREF="#fn_341"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,'--the means of salvation, assuredly, is the sacrifice: 'may he know the sacrifice' is what he thereby says.--'Favourable to thee, O Sacrificer, is</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the deity!' by this he says 'favourable is the deity to thee, O Sacrificer, whose Hot<I>ri</I> is Agni&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_344"></A><A HREF="#fn_342"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!'--'Take up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_345"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the spoon, O Adhvaryu, full of butter!' thereby he urges on the Adhvaryu. The reason why he mentions one (spoon) only (is this).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:2">1:5:2:2</A></FONT></span>2. The Sacrificer, doubtless, stands behind the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;, and he, who means evil to him, stands behind the upabh<I>ri</I>t; and if he were to speak of two (spoons), he would cause the spiteful enemy to countervail the Sacrificer. Behind the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; stands the eater, and behind the upabh<I>ri</I>t the one to be eaten; and if he were to speak of two (spoons), he would make the one to be eaten countervail the eater. For these reasons he speaks of one (spoon) only.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:3">1:5:2:3</A></FONT></span>3. [He continues],'--(the spoon which is) devoted to the gods, possessed of all boons,' he praises, he magnifies it when he says 'devoted to the gods, possessed of all boons.'--'Let us praise the gods, the praiseworthy! let us adore the adorable! let us worship the worshipful!' that is, 'let us praise those gods who are praiseworthy! let us adore those who are adorable! let us worship those who are worthy of worship!' the praiseworthy, to wit, are the men, the adorable the fathers, and the worshipful the gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:4">1:5:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. For, indeed, the creatures that are not allowed to take part in the sacrifice are forlorn; and therefore</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A></p>  
<p>he makes those creatures here on earth that are not forlorn, take part in the sacrifice: behind the men are the beasts, and behind the gods are the birds, the plants, and the trees; and thus all that here exists is made to take part in the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:5">1:5:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. These same (preceding formulas) are nine utterances; for nine, in number, are those breaths (or vital airs) in man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_346"></A><A HREF="#fn_344"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and these he thereby puts into him (the sacrificer): for this reason there are nine utterances.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:6">1:5:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. The sacrifice fled away from the gods. The gods called out after it, 'Listen (a-<I>s</I>ru) to us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_347"></A><A HREF="#fn_345"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>! come back to us!' It replied, 'So be it!' and returned to the gods; and with what had thus returned to them, the gods worshipped; and by worshipping with it they became the gods they now are.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:7">1:5:2:7</A></FONT></span>7. Now when he (the Adhvaryu) calls (on the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra), he thereby calls after the sacrifice, 'Listen to us! come back to us!' and when he (the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra) responds, then the sacrifice comes back, saying 'so be it!' and with it, thus passing over to them, as with seed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_348"></A><A HREF="#fn_346"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the priests carry on the tradition, imperceptibly to the sacrificer; for even as people hand on from one to the other a full vessel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_349"></A><A HREF="#fn_347"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, in</p>

<p><A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the same way they (the priests) hand down that (sacrifice) from one to the other. They hand it down by means of speech, for the sacrifice is speech (prayer), and speech is seed: therefore they keep up the tradition by means of it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:8">1:5:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. After he has said (to the Hot<I>ri</I>), 'Recite!' the Adhvaryu must utter nothing improper (worldly); neither must the Hot<I>ri</I> utter anything improper. The Adhvaryu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_350"></A><A HREF="#fn_348"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> utters his call: thereby the sacrifice passes on to the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:9">1:5:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. The &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra must utter nothing improper until his response. The &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra responds: thereby the sacrifice passes back to the Adhvaryu.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:10">1:5:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. The Adhvaryu must utter nothing improper until he pronounces (the word) 'ya<I>g</I>a (recite the offering-prayer):' in saying 'ya<I>g</I>a<font size="-1" color="green">'</font> the Adhvaryu hands the sacrifice on to the Hot<I>ri</I>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:11">1:5:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. The Hot<I>ri</I> must utter nothing improper until his vasha<I>t</I>-call. By the vasha<I>t</I>-call he pours it (the sacrifice) into the fire, as seed into the womb; for the fire is indeed the womb of the sacrifice, from thence it is brought forth. So now at the havis-sacrifice. And at the Soma-cult,--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:12">1:5:2:12</A></FONT></span>12. When he has drawn (the Soma), the Adhvaryu must not utter anything improper until his summons</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_142"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 142</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (for the chanting of the stotra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_351"></A><A HREF="#fn_349"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>): with the call 'draw near!' the Adhvaryu hands the sacrifice on to the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s (chanters).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:13">1:5:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. The Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s must not utter anything improper until the last (stotra-verse): 'this is the last one,' thus thinking, the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s hand on the sacrifice to the Hot<I>ri</I>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:14">1:5:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. The Hot<I>ri</I> must utter nothing improper until the vasha<I>t</I>-call. With the vasha<I>t</I>-call he pours it (the sacrifice) into the fire, as seed into the womb; for the fire is indeed the womb of the sacrifice, since from thence it is brought forth.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:15">1:5:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. If he whom the sacrifice approaches were to utter anything improper, he would waste the sacrifice, even as he might waste (water by spilling from) a full vessel. And where the officiating priests thus practice sacrifice with a perfect mutual understanding between them, there everything works regularly and no hitch occurs: therefore it is in this way that the sacrifice must be nursed.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:16">1:5:2:16</A></FONT></span>16. Now there are here five utterances, viz. (1) 'Bid (him, Agni, or them) hear!' (2) 'Yea, may he (or, one) hear!' (3) 'Pronounce the prayer to the kindling-sticks!' (4) 'We who pronounce the prayer . . .' (5) 'May he bear (the sacrifice to the gods)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="#fn_350"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!' fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the animal victim, five are the seasons of the year: this is the one measure of the sacrifice, this its consummation.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:17">1:5:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. These (five formulas) consist of seventeen syllables;--seventeenfold, indeed, is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the sacrifice: this is the one measure of the sacrifice, this its consummation.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:18">1:5:2:18</A></FONT></span>18. With 'O <I>s</I>r&acirc;vaya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_353"></A><A HREF="#fn_351"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!' the gods sent forth the east wind; with 'Astu <I>s</I>rausha<I>t</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_351"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!' they caused the clouds to flow together; with 'Ya<I>g</I>a (pronounce the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;)!' (they sent forth) the lightning; with' Ye ya<I>g</I>&acirc;mahe (we who pray),' the thunder; with the vasha<I>t</I>-call they caused it to rain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:19">1:5:2:19</A></FONT></span>19. Should he (the sacrificer) be desirous of rain, or should he perform a special offering&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, or even at the new- and full-moon sacrifice itself, he may say, 'Verily, I am desirous of rain!'--and he may also say to the Adhvaryu, 'Ponder thou in thy mind the east wind and the lightning!'--to the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra, 'Ponder thou the clouds in thy mind!'--to the Hot<I>ri</I>, 'Ponder thou in thy mind the thunder and rain!'--to the Brahman, 'Ponder thou all, these in thy mind!'--for where the officiating priests thus practice sacrifice with a perfect mutual understanding between them, there it will indeed rain.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:2:20">1:5:2:20</A></FONT></span>20. With 'O <I>s</I>r&acirc;vaya!' the gods called the shining one (vir&acirc;<I>g</I>, viz. cow), with 'Astu <I>s</I>rausha<I>t</I>!' they untied the calf and let it go to her; with 'Ya<I>g</I>a!' they raised (its head to the udder of the cow)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; with</p>

The shining one, doubtless, is this (earth), and of her this is the milking: and for him who knows this to be the milking of the shining one, this shining (earth-cow) thus milks out all his desires.</p>
