### SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:1">1:2:1:1</span></span>1. Now
the one (viz. the Âgnîdhra) puts the potsherds on (the Gârhapatya fire);
the other (viz. the Adhvaryu) the two mill-stones (on the black antelope
skin): these two acts are done simultaneously. The reason why they are
done simultaneously (is this):

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:2">1:2:1:2</span></span>2. The
head of this sacrifice is (represented by) the rice-cake <span
id="fr_142"></span>[3](#fn_142): for those potsherds (kapâla.md), no doubt,
are to this (rice-cake) what the skull bones (kapâla) are to the head,
and the ground rice is

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

nothing else than the brain. Now this (combination of skull and brain)
certainly forms one limb: 'Let us put that (which is) one together! Let
us make it one!' thus they think; and therefore the two acts are done
simultaneously.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:3">1:2:1:3</span></span>3. He who
puts the potsherds on (the fire), takes the shovelling-stick (upavesha),
with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 17 a): 'Bold (dh*ri*sh*t*i) art thou!' For
since with it he, as it were, attacks the fire boldly, therefore it is
called dh*ri*sh*t*i <span id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_143.md). And since
with it he touches (the coals) at the sacrifice, since with it he
attends to (upa-vish) this (Gârhapatya fire), therefore it is called
upavesha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:4">1:2:1:4</span></span>4. With
it he shifts the coals to the fore-part <span
id="fr_144"></span>[2](#fn_144) (of the khara or hearth-mound.md), with the
text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 17 b): 'O fire! cast off the fire that eateth raw
flesh! drive away the corpse-eating one!' For the raw flesh-eating
(fire) is the one with which men cook what they eat; and the
corpse-eating one is that on which they burn (the dead) man: these two
he thereby expels from it (the Gârhapatya).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:5">1:2:1:5</span></span>5. He now
pulls toward himself <span id="fr_145"></span>[3](#fn_145.md) one coal,
with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 17 c): 'Bring hither that (fire) which
maketh offerings to the gods!' He thinks: 'On that (fire), which makes
offerings to the gods, we

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

will cook the oblations! on that one we will perform the sacrifice!' and
for this reason he pulls (one of the coals) toward himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:6">1:2:1:6</span></span>6. On it
he places the central potsherd <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_146.md).
For

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

the gods, when they were performing sacrifice, were in fear of a
disturbance from the Asuras and Rakshas. They were afraid lest those
evil spirits, the Rakshas, might rise from below them. Now Agni (fire)
is the repeller of the Rakshas, and for this reason he thus places (the
potsherd) on it. The reason why it is just this (coal) and no other (on
which the potsherd is put) is, that this one, having been consecrated by
the (above) sacrificial formula, is sacrificially pure: that is why he
places the central potsherd on it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:7">1:2:1:7</span></span>7. He
puts it on, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 17 d): 'Thou art firm; make thou
the earth firm!' For under the form of the earth he renders this same
(sacrifice) firm; by it he chases away the spiteful enemy. He adds:
'Thee, devoted to the Brahman, devoted to the kshatra, devoted to the
(sacrificer's) kinsmen, I put on for the destruction of the enemy!'
Manifold, indeed, are the prayers for blessing in the sacrificial texts
(ya*g*us): by this one he prays for the priestly and military orders,
those two towers of strength (vi rye, energies) <span
id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_147). 'Thee, devoted to the (sacrificer's.md)
kinsmen,' he says, because kinsmen mean wealth, and wealth he thereby
prays for. When he says, 'I put thee on for the destruction of the
enemy,' whether or not he wishes to exorcise, let him say, 'for the
destruction of so

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

and so!' The moment it (the potsherd) has been put down (and while it is
still being touched) with the (fore-)finger of his left hand,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:8">1:2:1:8</span></span>8. He
seizes a (second) coal, lest the evil spirits, the Rakshas, should in
the meantime rush in here. For the Brâhman is the repeller of the
Rakshas <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_148.md): hence, the moment it (the
potsherd) has been put down (and while it is still being touched) with
the finger of his left hand,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:9">1:2:1:9</span></span>9. He
pushes the coal on it, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 18 a): 'Accept, O
Agni, this holy work (brahman) <span id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_149.md)!'
He says this, lest the evil spirits, the Rakshas, should rush in here
before; for Agni is the repeller of the Rakshas: this is the reason why
he pushes it on (the potsherd).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:10">1:2:1:10</span></span>10. He
then puts on that (potsherd) which is (to stand) behind (or west of the
first or central one), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 18 b): 'A support art
thou! make firm the aërial region!' Under the form of the atmosphere he
makes this (sacrifice) firm; by this he chases away the spiteful enemy.
He adds: 'Thee, devoted to the brahman, devoted to the kshatra, devoted
to the (sacrificer's) kinsmen, I put on for the destruction of the
enemy!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:11">1:2:1:11</span></span>11. He
then puts on that one which is (to stand) before (i.e. east of the first
potsherd), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 18 c): 'A stay art thou! do thou
make firm the sky!' Under the form of the sky he makes this same
(sacrifice) firm; by it he chases away the spiteful enemy. He adds:
'Thee, devoted to the brahman, devoted to the kshatra, devoted to the
kinsmen, I put on for the destruction of the enemy!'

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:12">1:2:1:12</span></span>12. He
now puts on the one that is (to stand) on the right (i.e. south of the
first), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 18 d): 'For all the regions I put
thee on!' What fourth (world) there is or is not beyond these (three)
worlds, by that indeed he thereby chases away the spiteful enemy.
Uncertain, no doubt, is what fourth (world) there is or is not beyond
these (three) worlds, and uncertain also are all those regions; for this
reason he says, 'For all the regions I put thee on!' The remaining
potsherds he puts on <span id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_150.md) either
silently, or with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 18 e): 'Layer-forming are ye!
heap-forming are ye!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:13">1:2:1:13</span></span>13. He
then covers them over with (hot) coals, whilst muttering the text
(Vâ*g*. S. I, 18 f): 'May ye be heated with the heat of the Bh*ri*gus
and

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aṅgiras <span
id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151.md)!' for it is indeed the brightest light,
that of the Bh*ri*gus and Aṅgiras. He covers them with the view that
'they shall be well heated.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:14">1:2:1:14</span></span>14. Now
he <span id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_152.md) who puts the two mill-stones on
(the black antelope skin), (in the first place) takes up the black
antelope skin, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 19): 'Bliss-bestowing art
thou!' He shakes it, with the text (ib.): 'Shaken off is the Rakshas,
shaken off are the enemies!' the import and application of which is the
same (as above, I, 1, 4, 4). He spreads it (on the ground) with the
neck-part turned towards west, whilst muttering the text (ib.): 'The
skin of Aditi (the inviolate or boundless earth) art thou! May Aditi
acknowledge (receive) thee!' the import (of this formula) being the same
(as before, I, 1, 4, 5).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:15">1:2:1:15</span></span>15. He
then puts the lower mill-stone on it, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 19):
'A rock-bowl art thou! May the skin of Aditi acknowledge thee!' for it
is a bowl (dhisha*n*â) and a rock too; and by saying, 'May the skin of
Aditi acknowledge thee,' he establishes an understanding between it and
the black antelope skin, so that 'they will not hurt each other.' This
one (the lower mill-stone) represents the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:16">1:2:1:16</span></span>16. He
now puts upon (the west side of) it the wedge <span
id="fr_153"></span>[3](#fn_153.md) with its point turned towards north,
whilst

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

muttering the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 19): 'The stay of the sky art thou!'
that is to say, it represents the atmosphere; for by means of the
atmospheric region those two, the sky and the earth, are firmly kept
asunder; and for this reason he says, 'The stay of the sky art thou!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:17">1:2:1:17</span></span>17. He
then puts the upper mill-stone on (the lower one), with the text (Vâ*g*.
S. I, 19): 'A rock-born bowl art thou! May the rock acknowledge thee!'
For this one being smaller is, as it were, the daughter (of the lower
mill-stone) <span id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_154.md); for this reason he
calls it 'rock-born.' 'May the rock acknowledge thee!' he says, because
one of the same kin acknowledges (receives the other): thereby he
establishes an understanding between those two millstones, thinking
'they will not hurt one another!' This one, as it were, represents the
sky; (or) the two mill-stones are, as it were, the two jaws, and the
wedge is the tongue: that is why he beats (the mill-stones) with the
wedge <span id="fr_155"></span>[2](#fn_155.md), for it is with the tongue
that one speaks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:18">1:2:1:18</span></span>18. He
now pours the rice on (the lower stone), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I,
20): 'Grain (dhânyam) art thou! do thou gratify (dhi) <span
id="fr_156"></span>[3](#fn_156.md) the gods!' for it is

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

grain; and it is with the intention 'that it may gratify the gods' that
the rice-oblation is taken.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:19">1:2:1:19</span></span>19. He
then grinds it, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 20): 'For out-breathing (I
grind) thee! for in-breathing thee! for through-breathing (pervading
vital air) <span id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_157.md) thee! May I impart a
long duration to the life (of the sacrificer) <span
id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_158.md)!' He pours it (the ground rice on the
skin), with the text (ib.): 'May the divine Savit*ri*, the
golden-handed, receive thee with a flawless hand <span
id="fr_159"></span>[3](#fn_159)!' 'For his (the sacrificer's.md) eye (I
look at) thee <span id="fr_160"></span>[4](#fn_160.md)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:20">1:2:1:20</span></span>20. The
reason why he thus grinds it, is that the sacrificial food of the gods
is living, is am*ri*ta (ambrosia, or not dead) for the immortals. Now
with the mortar and pestle, and with the two millstones they kill this
rice-offering (havirya*gñ*a).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:21">1:2:1:21</span></span>21.
When he now says: 'For out-breathing thee! for in-breathing thee!' he
thereby again imparts out-breathing and in-breathing (to it), and by
saying 'for through-breathing thee!' he imparts through-breathing (to
it). By 'may I impart a long duration to the life!' he bestows life on
it. By 'may the divine Savit*ri*, the golden-handed, receive thee with a
flawless

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

hand!' he says: 'May they be well received!' By 'for the eye thee!' he
bestows eye-sight on it. Now these (attributes) are those of a living
being; and thus that sacrificial food for the gods is indeed living, is
am*ri*ta (ambrosia, or not dead) for the immortals. This is the reason
why he thus grinds (the rice). (Whilst) they are grinding the (ground)
grains <span id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_161), (and whilst.md) they are
heating the potsherds,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:1:22">1:2:1:22</span></span>22.
Some one <span id="fr_162"></span>[2](#fn_162.md) pours clarified butter
(into the â*g*yasthâlî, or butter-pot). Now whatever oblation, in being
taken, is announced to a (particular) deity, that belongs to the
respective deity, that he takes with a special prayer; but in taking
this oblation, to wit, the butter, he does not announce it to any
particular deity, and therefore takes it with an undefined formula, viz.
with (Vâ*g*. S. I, 20): 'Juice of the great ones art thou!' For 'the
great ones' some (take to be) a name for the cows; and their juice
indeed it is: for this reason he says, 'The juice of the great ones art
thou!' And thus, moreover, is some of that (butter) taken with a
sacrificial formula: and for this reason also he says, 'The juice of the
great ones art thou!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_142"></span>[32:3](sbe1207.htm#fr_142.md) This idea was no
doubt suggested by the derivation of the word puro*d*â*s* (rice-cake),
from puras, 'before, in front, at the head,' and dâ*s*, 'to offer' (see
I; 6, 2, 5 ); the double meaning of kapâla (shell or cup and skull)
being made use of to complete the simile.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[33:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_143.md) The upavesha, or
dh*ri*sh*t*i, is made of fresh vara*n*a or palâ*s*a wood, a cubit
(aratni) or span (vitasti) long; one of its ends having the shape of a
hand (hastâk*ri*ti), to serve as a coal shovel; cf. Mahîdh. and Schol.
on Kâty. I, 3, 36; II, 4, 26. Dh*ri*sh*t*i is apparently derived from
the root dh*ri*sh, 'to be bold.'

<span id="fn_144"></span>[33:2](sbe1207.htm#fr_144.md) The burning coals
have been hitherto lying on the western side of the Gârhapatya hearth,
and as this side, which has been well heated by this time, will be used
for the potsherds to be put on, he shifts the coals to the eastern or
fore-part of the hearth.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[33:3](sbe1207.htm#fr_145.md) Viz. to the centre
of the cooking-place.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[34:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_146.md) In Yâ*gñ*ika Deva's
commentary on Katy. II, 4, 37, full explanations are given regarding the
manner of arranging the potsherds (kapâlas) on which the sacrificial
cakes are spread, and which vary in number and shape. The Adhvaryu is
first to describe a circle, the diameter of which is six aṅgulas (an
aṅgula or thumb's breadth=about ¾ inch). This circle he then divides
into three parts by drawing across, from west to east, two parallel
lines at a distance of two aṅgulas from one another, so as to make the
two outer (or southern and northern) segments of equal size. The middle
division he then covers with three equal square potsherds (measuring two
aṅgulas on each side), by laying down first the central one, then the
one behind or west of it, and lastly the front or eastern one. He then
lays down another (the fourth) south of the first or central one; after
which he divides the still remaining potsherds equally between the
southern and the northern segments, or, in case of that number being
uneven, assigns the odd potsherd to the southern division. Thus, in the
present case, where in the first place a cake on eight potsherds is to
be offered to Agni; after laying down the three intermediate ones and
the fourth, or central one of the southern division, he divides the
remaining four equally between the southern and northern segments,
beginning, in laying them down, in the south-east corner, and moving
around from right to left, so as to end in the north-east. Similarly in
the case of the cake on eleven potsherds for Agnîshomau, after laying
down the first four potsherds, he assigns four of the remaining seven to
the southern, and three to the northern division. Thus with cakes
requiring an uneven number of potsherds, the number of those of the
southern division exceeds that of the northern one by two; and in the
case of an even number, by one only. This is the rule applying to cakes
requiring at least six potsherds. When one potsherd only is required, it
is to be of the size of a hand; when two, they are to form a circle
divided into two equal parts by a line drawn from south to north; when
three, the circle is divided into three sections from south to north;
when four or five, it is divided into two halves from west to east; and
in the one case three potsherds are placed in the southern and one (of
half-moon shape) in the northern half; in the other case three in the
northern and two in the southern division. The potsherds, <span
id="page_35">p. 35</span> though mostly irregular in shape, must always
exactly fit one another, so as not to leave any space between. This is
effected by rubbing the edges. The cake itself is to be of the shape of
a tortoise; the convex shield, or carapace, of the latter consisting of
plates arranged in a somewhat similar way as the potsherds of most
cakes, viz. in a central (dorsal) and two lateral sets.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[35:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_147.md) For special prayers
for the two highest castes, in the Vâ*g*as. Sa*m*h., cf. Weber, Ind.
Stud. X, 27.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[36:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_148.md) Cf. I, 1, 4, 6.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[36:2](sbe1207.htm#fr_149.md) Mahîdhara admits the
alternative interpretation, 'Receive (me) the priest!'

<span id="fn_150"></span>[37:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_150.md) Viz. dividing them
in the manner explained at [p. 34](#page_34), note [1](#fn_146.md), and
beginning (south)-east, and moving around from left to right (i.e.
following the course of the sun). Mr. Ralph Griffith (Translation of the
Rámáyan, I, p. 90) has compared this Hindu rite of pradakshi*n*a or
dakshi*n*îkara*n*a with the Gaelic deasil, as described in the following
passage of Sir W. Scott's The Two Drovers: "But it is little I would
care for the food that nourishes me, or the fire that warms me, or for
God's blessed sun itself, if aught but weel should happen to the
grandson of my father. So let me walk the deasil round you, that you may
go safe out into the far foreign land, and come safe home." Robin Oig
stopped, half embarrassed, half laughing, and signing to those near that
he only complied with the old woman to soothe her humour. In the
meantime she traced around him, with wavering steps, the propitiation,
which some have thought has been derived from the Druidical mythology.
It consists, as is well known, in the person, who makes the deasil,
walking three times round the person who is the object of the ceremony,
taking care to move according to the course of the sun.' Cf. note at [p.
45](sbe1208.htm#page_45.md). Note also the etymological connection between
dakshi*n*a and deiseil (Old Ir. dessel, from dess, Gael. deas, south or
right side). For the corresponding rite (dextratio) at the Roman
marriage ceremonies see Rossbach, Römische Ehe, pp. 315, 316; Weber,
Ind. Stud. V, p. 221.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[38:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_151.md) The old families of
the Bh*ri*gus and Aṅgiras are frequently mentioned together, and often
also in conjunction with the Atharvans: it is indeed to these three
families that the native authorities attribute the texts and ritual of
the Atharva-veda, or fourth Veda, which is generally referred to in the
later Vedic writings under the designation Atharvâṅgirasas. It is
probable that the Bh*ri*gu-Aṅgiras in the above formula of the Vâ*g*as.
Sa*m*hitâ are intended as equivalent to the latter term. Cf. Weber,
Omina et Portenta, p. 346.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[38:2](sbe1207.htm#fr_152.md) Viz. the Adhvaryu;
cf. I, 2, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[38:3](sbe1207.htm#fr_153.md) According to the
corresponding rule of Kâtyâyana (II, 5, 4) <span id="page_39">p.
39</span> and to his commentators (and Mahîdhara on Vâ*g*. S. I, 19) and
the Black [Ya*g*ur](errata.htm#4.md)-veda, he does not lay the wedge on the
lower millstone, but inserts it under the west or back-part of the
stone, so as to make the latter incline towards east and to steady it.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[39:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_154.md) In the Gobhilîya
G*ri*hya-sûtra II, 1, 16 the upper stone is similarly called 'the son or
child' of the lower one \[d*ri*shatputra\], which the editor,
*K*andrakânta, interprets as 'd*ri*shad and its son;' or optionally,
'the son of the d*ri*shad.' Cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. V, p. 305 note.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[39:2](sbe1207.htm#fr_155.md) See I, 1, 4, 13.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[39:3](sbe1207.htm#fr_156.md) Mahîdhara derives
dhânya from the root dhi; and apparently allows to it here the double
meaning 'corn or grain,' and 'that which satisfies or pleases.'

<span id="fn_157"></span>[40:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_157.md) On the three kinds
of breathing, see I, 1, 3, 2-3.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[40:2](sbe1207.htm#fr_158.md) According to
Kâtyâyana (II, 5, 7) and Mahîdhara, this last formula ('May I,' &c.)
should be joined to the one that follows, and pronounced by the Adhvaryu
whilst he pours the ground rice on the skin. Mahîdhara interprets it
thus: 'I put thee, (O rice! on the black antelope skin) for (increasing)
the life (of the sacrificer) with a view to a long continuance (of the
sacrificial work);' or 'I place thee along the long expanse (i.e. the
skin) for thy (the rice's) long life!'

<span id="fn_159"></span>[40:3](sbe1207.htm#fr_159.md) See I, 1, 4, 23.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[40:4](sbe1207.htm#fr_160.md) Thus, according to
Kâty. or Mahîdh., whilst he looks at the ground rice on the skin.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[41:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_161.md) Pi*m*shanti
pish*t*âni; the grinding of the ground or grinding of flour
(pish*t*a-pesha*n*a) is a common expression in later Sanskrit for doing
a useless work ('carrying owls to Athens,' or coals to Newcastle'). In
the present passage, however, the phrase has to be understood, according
to Sâya*n*a, as meaning 'whilst they (the sacrificer's people) carry on
the work of grinding begun by the Adhvaryu.'

<span id="fn_162"></span>[41:2](sbe1207.htm#fr_162.md) The Âgnîdhra or
somebody else, according to Sâya*n*a; but according to the Schol. on
Kâty. II, 5, 9, it is done by the sacrificer himself, who thereupon
prepares the veda or bunch of sacrificial grass, tied in the middle, and
cut straight at each end, and used for sweeping, &c. Cf. Kâty. I, 3,
