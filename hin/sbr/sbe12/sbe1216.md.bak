### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE KINDLING OF THE FIRE, THE PRAVARA, AND THE TWO LIBATIONS (ÂGHÂRA) OF BUTTER.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:1">1:3:5:1</span></span>1. With
the fire-wood (idhma, lighting material) the Adhvaryu lights (indh) the
fire: hence it is called fire-wood. And with the kindling verses
(sâmidhenî) the Hot*ri* kindles (sam-indh, to make blaze): hence they
are called kindling verses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:2">1:3:5:2</span></span>2. He
(the Adhvaryu <span id="fr_264"></span>[1](#fn_263).md) says (to the
Hot*ri*): 'Recite to the fire as it is being kindled!' for it is to the
fire, when it is being kindled, that he recites.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:3">1:3:5:3</span></span>3. Here
now some people say, 'O Hotar, recite to the fire as it is being
kindled!' But let him not say so; for that (priest) is not a Hot*ri* as
yet; only when he (the sacrificer) elects him <span
id="fr_265"></span>[2](#fn_264.md), does he

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

become a Hot*ri*. Let him therefore say, 'Recite to the fire as it is
being kindled!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:4">1:3:5:4</span></span>4. He
recites (verses) addressed to Agni: he accordingly kindles it (the fire)
with the aid of its own deity. In the gâyatrî metre (are the verses
which) he recites; for the gâyatrî is Agni's metre: by means of its own
metre he thereby kindles it. The gâyatrî is vigour, the gâyatrî is the
brahman <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_265) (the priestly order.md): with
vigour he thereby kindles it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:5">1:3:5:5</span></span>5. Eleven
(verses) he recites; for of eleven syllables consists the trish*t*ubh
metre. The gâyatrî is the brahman and the trish*t*ubh is the kshatra (or
military order) <span id="fr_267"></span>[2](#fn_266.md). With the aid of
these two energies he thus kindles it: for this reason he recites eleven
(verses).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:6">1:3:5:6</span></span>6. Thrice
he recites the first verse, and thrice the last one; for of threefold
beginning are sacrifices, and of threefold termination: therefore he
recites thrice the first and the last (verses).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:7">1:3:5:7</span></span>7.
Fifteen sâmidhenî verses result (from this repetition of the first and
last of the eleven verses). The fifteen-versed chant <span
id="fr_268"></span>[3](#fn_267.md), doubtless, is the thunderbolt,

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

and the thunderbolt means strength; so that he thereby converts the
sâmidhenîs into strength: hence, if he should hate any one, he may crush
him with his great toes <span id="fr_269"></span>[1](#fn_268.md) at the
time when those (verses) are recited. By saying, 'I here crush so and
so!' he crushes him with that thunderbolt.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:8">1:3:5:8</span></span>8.
Fifteen nights indeed there are in a half-moon; and growing by
half-moons the year passes: hence he thereby obtains the nights.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:9">1:3:5:9</span></span>9. Now in
the fifteen gâyatrî verses there are indeed three hundred and sixty
syllables <span id="fr_270"></span>[2](#fn_269.md); and three hundred and
sixty days there are in a year: hence he thereby obtains the days, he
thereby obtains the year.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:10">1:3:5:10</span></span>10. For
an ish*t*i (which is performed in order to obtain the fulfilment of a
special wish) <span id="fr_271"></span>[3](#fn_270.md) let him recite
seventeen sâmidhenî verses; for in a low voice he sacrifices to the
deity to which he offers an ish*t*i.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Twelve months,
namely, there are in a year, and five seasons <span
id="fr_272"></span>[1](#fn_271): this (makes.md) the seventeenfold
Pra*g*âpati. For verily Pra*g*âpati is all: hence for what wish he
performs the ish*t*i, that wish he thus accomplishes by means of the
All. In a low voice he sacrifices to the deity; for what is spoken in a
low voice is undefined (indistinct), and undefined is the 'All:' hence
for whatever wish he performs the ish*t*i, that wish he thus
accomplishes by means of the All. This is the practice in regard to an
ish*t*i.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:11">1:3:5:11</span></span>11.
Some people say: 'Let him recite twenty-one sâmidhenî verses also at the
full- and new-moon sacrifice.' Twelve, doubtless, are the months of the
year, five the seasons, and three these worlds: this (makes) twenty; and
the twenty-first is this very (sun) that here shines: he is the resort,
he the stay; thereby he (the sacrificer) obtains this resort, this stay.
He may therefore recite twenty-one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:12">1:3:5:12</span></span>12. Let
him recite them only for one of established prosperity (gata*s*rî), who
would not wish to become either better or worse. For, what he for whom
they recite is like, like that he will either be or worse <span
id="fr_273"></span>[2](#fn_272.md), for whom, that knows this, they recite

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

those (twenty-one verses). This, however, is mere speculation, for those
(twenty-one verses) are not recited <span
id="fr_274"></span>[1](#fn_273.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:13">1:3:5:13</span></span>13.
Thrice he should recite the first and thrice the last (verse), without
drawing breath; for three are these worlds, so that he thereby spreads
(san-tan) these worlds, gains these worlds. Also three breaths there are
in man: this recitation thereby causes him (the sacrificer) to be
extended (santata), not cut short (by death).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:14">1:3:5:14</span></span>14. He
(the Hot*ri*) should endeavour to recite this (uninterruptedly) as long
as his strength lasts. If, on the other hand, he were to take breath in
the middle (of the verse), it would be a slight on this very
(sacrifice) <span id="fr_275"></span>[2](#fn_274.md): by reciting this
(holy) composition

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

without taking breath, that slight will be avoided.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:15">1:3:5:15</span></span>15. If,
however, he do not care to undertake this, he may also recite one
(verse) at a time without drawing breath: he thereby spreads those
worlds one by one, gains those worlds one by one. The reason why he
takes breath, is that the gâyatrî is indeed breath; and that by reciting
a complete gâyatrî verse, he accordingly bestows complete breathing (on
the sacrificer): let him therefore recite one (verse) at a time without
breathing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:5:16">1:3:5:16</span></span>16. He
recites them in a continuous, uninterrupted way: thereby he makes the
days and nights of the year continuous, and in a continuous,
uninterrupted way revolve those days and nights of the year. And in this
way he gives no access to the spiteful enemy; but access he would indeed
give, if he were to recite them discontinuously: he therefore recites in
a continuous, uninterrupted way.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_263"></span>[95:1](sbe1216.htm#fr_264.md) The Adhvaryu, in the
first place, prepares a seat for the Hot*ri*, either west of the altar
or north of its left hip; and covers it with dry Ku*s*a grass. \[He then
calls, 'O Hot*ri*, come!'\] The Hot*ri*; having rinsed his mouth
north-east of the Âhavanîya, with his face to the east, turns round from
left to right and betakes himself to the sacrificial ground, always
keeping his right foot before the left. He finally takes up his position
so as to have the heel of the right foot in a line with the north hip of
the altar, and the toes on the barhis; whilst he keeps the hands on a
level with the heart, spread open and joined together, and looks towards
the junction of the earth and sky. The Adhvaryu then takes a samidh
(kindling-stick) and calls on him as above. The Hot*ri* now mutters the
formulas 'Adoration to the teacher! Adoration to the observer! Adoration
to the promulgator!' &c. (Â*s*v. *S*rautas I, 2, 1). The sacrificer then
takes the wooden sword and says, 'Recite for me, as it were, stretching
along (i.e. continuously)!' whereupon the Hot*ri*; having asked and
received the permission of the Brahman, proceeds to recite the kindling
verses. Kâty. III, 1, 1 seq.; Â*s*v. I, 1, 4 seq.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[95:2](sbe1216.htm#fr_265.md) This does not take
place until the pravara or invitation addressed to Agni, the Hot*ri* of
the gods, to assist in calling the <span id="page_96">p. 96</span> gods
to the sacrifice, cf. Sâya*n*a and *S*at. Br. I, 5, 1, 1 seq. According
to some authorities, however, the choosing of the Hot*ri* seems to take
place at this particular time, or even before, at the time of the
agnyanvâdhâna; cf. Hillebrandt, p. 73.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[96:1](sbe1216.htm#fr_266.md) The gâyatrî (though
it is not the most frequent metre) is considered as the first, as it is
the shortest, of Vedic metres. The hymns addressed to Agni are mostly in
the gâyatrî metre.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[96:2](sbe1216.htm#fr_267.md) The hymns
celebrating the heroic deeds of Indra and his associates, the wind-gods,
are almost entirely composed in the trish*t*ubh, the most frequent of
Vedic metres.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[96:3](sbe1216.htm#fr_268.md) The
pa*ñk*ada*s*a-stoma, or form of recitation in fifteen verses at the
Soma-sacrifice, is sacred to Indra (Nirukta 7, 10), the wielder of the
thunderbolt.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[97:1](sbe1216.htm#fr_269.md) Or, with his thumbs
(aṅgush*th*âbhyâm). The Kâ*n*va text has 'pâdyâbhyâm aṅgush*th*âbhyâm;'
but Kâty. III, 1, 7 has 'aṅgush*th*âbhyâ*m* pâdyâbhyâ*m* vâ,' which
would seem to leave a choice between the thumbs and the great toes; the
commentator, however, takes vâ in a restrictive sense. The sacrificer is
to press down the earth with his great toes (or thumbs) each time when a
kindling verse is recited.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[97:2](sbe1216.htm#fr_270.md) The gâyatrî verse
consists of three times eight syllables, and 24 × 15 = 360. In the place
of the last sâmidhenî (called paridhânîyâ), however, the Vâsish*th*as
have a trish*t*ubh stanza (4 × 11 syllables), so that the above
computation of syllables does not hold good in their case. One might be
inclined to infer from this that the trish*t*ubh was the more original,
a gâyatrî being substituted later to yield the above symbolical number
of syllables. Cf. Taitt. S. II, 5, 7 seq.; Taitt. Br. III, 5, 3.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[97:3](sbe1216.htm#fr_271.md) The kâmyesh*t*is,
and ish*t*is generally, are performed with certain modifications, on the
model of the new- and full-moon sacrifice, of which they are therefore
said to be vik*ri*tis or modifications.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[98:1](sbe1216.htm#fr_272.md) In other passages,
and in later times generally, six seasons, comprising two months each,
are counted, but the transitional season between winter and spring,
*s*i*s*ira, is not unfrequently, as in our passage, combined with the
winter season (hemanta), or partially with that and the spring
(vasanta). On the identification of Pra*g*âpati with the year, cf. note
on I, 2, 5, 12.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[98:2](sbe1216.htm#fr_273.md) The condition of one
who is gata*s*rî cannot be improved, but only impaired. The construction
of this paragraph is somewhat doubtful to me. It runs thus: Tâ haitâ
gata*s*rer evânubrûyâd ya i*kkh*en na *s*reyânt syâm na pâpîyân iti
yâd*ris*âya haiva sate ’nvâhus tâd*ri*n vâ haiva bhavati pâpîyân vâ
yasyaiva*m* vidusha etâ <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> anvâhu*h* so
eshâ mîmâ*m*saiva na tv evaitâ anû*k*yante. Sâya*n*a seems to take it
thus:--'He should recite them only for a gata*s*rî. A householder who
desires neither an improvement nor a lowering of his position, is just
such a one for whom the Hot*ri*s recite the sâmidhenîs in the appointed
(niyatena) way. Further, for whomsoever, that thus knows the irregular
(? aniyata, not regulated) way of recitation, they recite those
twenty-one sâmidhenîs, he becomes either worse or better. What is set
forth in the words from "A householder who desires neither an
improvement" &c. is mere speculation; the recitation is not to be
performed in this way.' The corresponding paragraph of the Kâ*n*va
recension is much briefer and clearer:--Tad etad gata*s*rîr eva kurvîta
na ha *s*reyân na pâpîyân bhavati yasyaivam anvâhu*h* saishâ
mîmâ*m*saiva na tv anû*k*yante, 'only a gata*s*rî, however, should do
this; for neither better nor worse becomes he for whom they recite thus.
This is indeed speculation, but they (the twenty-one sâmidhenîs) are not
recited.'

<span id="fn_273"></span>[99:1](sbe1216.htm#fr_274.md) In the Taitt. S. II,
5, 10, the number of verses (effected by the repetition) is given as
varying, according to the special object in view, between fifteen and
forty-eight.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[99:2](sbe1216.htm#fr_275.md) ? Or, it would be an
act of neglect on his, the sacrificer's, part: by (the Hot*ri*) reciting
without fetching breath, that act, that neglect would be avoided.
