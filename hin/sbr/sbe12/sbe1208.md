### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:1">1:2:2:1</span></span>1. He
pours (the ground rice) into that which contains the strainers--viz.
into a dish (pâtrî) on which he has laid the two strainers--with the
text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 21): 'At the impulse of the divine Savit*ri* I pour
thee out, with the arms of the A*s*vins, with the hands of Pûshan!' The
import of this formula is the same (as before, I, 1, 2, 17).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:2">1:2:2:2</span></span>2. He now
sits down somewhere inside the altar (vedi) <span
id="fr_163"></span>[1](#fn_163). Then some one (viz. the Âgnîdhra.md) comes
with the kneading-water <span id="fr_164"></span>[2](#fn_164.md) and brings
it to him. He (the Adhvaryu) receives it through the strainers, with the
text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 21): 'Let the waters mingle with the plants!' for
thereby the water unites with the plants, viz. with the ground
rice,--'The plants with the sap!' for the plants thereby unite with the
sap; viz. that ground rice with the water, for water is their sap,--'The
shining (or wealthy ones) with the moving!' for the shining ones are the
waters, and the moving ones are the plants, and these two are thereby
mixed together,--'Let the sweet mingle with the sweet!' whereby he says,
'let the savoury be mixed with the savoury!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:3">1:2:2:3</span></span>3. He
then mixes (the two) together, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 22): 'For
generation I unite thee!' for, in order that it (the dough or the
sacrificial cake prepared from it) may bring offspring to the
sacrificer,

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

for his prosperity, for food, and so on,--for these reasons he mixes
them together. And he also mixes them together with the intention of
placing it (the dough) on (the fire): hence, in order that it (the
sacrificial cake) may be produced over the fire, for that purpose also
he mixes them together.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:4">1:2:2:4</span></span>4. He now
divides it into two halves, if there be two oblations: at the full-moon
sacrifice there really are two oblations. He then touches them,--where
(by so doing) he would not again mix (the two) together,--with the
(respective) formulas (Vâ*g*. S. I, 22): 'This to Agni!' 'This to
Agni-Soma!' Separately indeed they take that sacrificial food (from the
cart) in the first place <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_165.md); then
they thresh it together, then they grind it together, then he again
divides it: for this reason he thus touches (them separately). The one
(the Adhvaryu) now places the cake over (the fire), the other (the
Âgnîdhra) puts the clarified butter on:

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:5">1:2:2:5</span></span>5. These
two acts are done simultaneously. The reason why these two acts are done
simultaneously is that one half of the body of the sacrifice no doubt is
that butter, and the other half is this rice-offering. 'That half and
this half, these two let us now take to the fire!' thus (they think):
for this reason those two acts are done simultaneously, and thus this
body of the sacrifice is joined together.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:6">1:2:2:6</span></span>6. That
one (the Âgnîdhra) puts the butter on, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 22):
'For sap--thee!' When he says 'for sap thee!' he says it for the sake of
rain; therefore he takes it off again, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 30):
'For juice--thee!' What juice is

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

derived (by the plants) from the rain, for that he says this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:7">1:2:2:7</span></span>7. Now he
(the Adhvaryu) puts on (adhi-v*rig*) the cake, with the text (Vâ*g*. S.
I, 22): 'Heat (or a hot vessel, gharma) art thou!' whereby he makes it
(a means of) sacrifice, and puts it on in the same (way as if he were
putting the (pravargya) cauldron gharma) <span
id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_166) on,--'Life-sustaining (vi*s*vâyus.md)!' he
adds, whereby he obtains life (for the sacrificer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:8">1:2:2:8</span></span>8. He
spreads it (over the respective potsherds), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I,
22): 'Spread widely, thou wide-spreading one!' whereby he causes it to
spread. He adds: 'May thy Lord of Sacrifice spread widely (prosper)!'
Lord of Sacrifice, namely, is the sacrificer: hence it is for the
sacrificer that he thereby prays for blessing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:9">1:2:2:9</span></span>9. Let
him not make it too broad; for he would make it a human (profane, common
cake), if he were to make it (too) broad. Unlucky for (or, excluded
from) the sacrifice indeed is that one, to wit, the common (cake). 'That
I may not do anything that

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

is unlucky at the sacrifice,' thus (he thinks, and) for that reason he
should not make it too broad.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:10">1:2:2:10</span></span>10. And
some now say: 'He should make it of the size of a horse's hoof!' But who
knows how large is a horse's hoof? Let him make it of such a size as in
his own mind he does not think would be too broad.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:11">1:2:2:11</span></span>11. He
then touches it over with water, either once or three times: for
whatever in this (rice-offering) they either injure or tear asunder in
the threshing or grinding of it, that--water being (a means of)
expiation (or purification)--he thereby expiates with water, that is,
with (the means of) expiation; that he thereby makes good: for this
reason he touches it over with water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:12">1:2:2:12</span></span>12. He
touches it over, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 22): 'May the fire not
injure thy skin!' for on the fire he is now going to heat it: 'May that
(fire) not injure thy skin!' this is what he thereby says.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:13">1:2:2:13</span></span>13. He
now carries fire round it <span id="fr_167"></span>[1](#fn_167.md). By this
he encloses it with an unbroken fence, lest the evil

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

spirits, the Rakshas, should seize upon it; for Agni (fire) is the
*r*epeller of the Rakshas: this is the reason why he carries fire round
it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:14">1:2:2:14</span></span>14. He
bakes <span id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_168.md) it, with the text (Vâ*g*. S.
I, 22): 'Let the divine (or God) Savit*ri* bake thee!' for it is not a
man that bakes it, but a god it is: therefore it is the God Savit*ri*
that bakes it <span id="fr_169"></span>[2](#fn_169.md). He adds: 'In the
highest heaven!' He means to say 'among the gods,' when he says 'in the
highest heaven.' He touches it: 'I will ascertain whether it is done!'
thus (he thinks, and) for that reason he touches it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:15">1:2:2:15</span></span>15. He
touches it, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 23): 'Be not afraid! shrink
not!' He thereby says: 'Do not thou be afraid, do not thou shrink,
because I, a man, touch thee that art not human!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:16">1:2:2:16</span></span>16.
When it is done, he covers it over (with hot ashes): 'Lest the evil
spirits, the Rakshas, should espy it,' thus (he thinks) and 'Lest it
should lie, as it were, naked and despoiled!' thus also (he
thinks):--that is the reason why he covers it over.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:17">1:2:2:17</span></span>17. He
covers it over, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 23): 'May the sacrifice not
be liable to languish, nor the sacrificer's race liable to languish!'
'That the sacrifice or the sacrificer may not languish after this, when
I cover this over,' thus (he thinks, and) for this reason he covers it
over in this manner (i.e. with the above text).

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:2:2:18">1:2:2:18</span></span>18. He
then pours out for the Âptya deities the water with which the dish has
been rinsed and that in which he has washed his fingers <span
id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_170.md). The reason why he pours it out for the
Âptyas (is this):

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_163"></span>[42:1](sbe1208.htm#fr_163.md) 'He sits down (with
the dish) either behind the cooking fire, or inside the altar,' Kâty.
II, 5, 11. According to Mahâdeva, the former alternative is the one
favoured by the Kâ*n*vas.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[42:2](sbe1208.htm#fr_164.md) According to Kâty.
II, 5, I, the kneading-water (or mixing-water, upasar*g*anî) has been
put on the (Gârhapatya) fire (by the Agnîdh) at the time of, or
previously to, the spreading of the black antelope skin.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[43:1](sbe1208.htm#fr_165.md) See I, 1, 2, 17
seq., especially [p. 17](sbe1204.htm#page_17.md), note
[2](sbe1204.htm#fn_108.md).

<span id="fn_166"></span>[44:1](sbe1208.htm#fr_166.md) Gharma, literally
'heat,' is also the technical term for a kind of cauldron (also called
mahâvîra) used at the Pravargya ceremony, a preparatory rite of the
Soma-sacrifice: the empty cauldron is there put on the fire, and when
thoroughly heated (whence its name), fresh milk is poured into it. The
technical phrase for putting on the cauldron is pra-v*rig*, from which
pravargya is derived; and the same verb, though with a different
preposition (viz. adhi-v*rig*), being technically used for the putting
on of the sacrificial cake, this verbal coincidence has probably
suggested this connection of the two ceremonies, there being a constant
tendency to establish some kind of relation between ordinary offerings
and the Soma-sacrifice, as the most solemn one; cf. III, 4, 4, 1; X, 2,
5, 3 seq.; Ait. Br. I, 18 seq. Previously to the spreading of the cake,
the cinders are swept off from the potsherds with the grass-brush
(veda), Hilleb. p. 41, note 7.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[45:1](sbe1208.htm#fr_167.md) The
paryagnikara*n*am consists in performing pradakshi*n*â (see [p.
37](sbe1207.htm#page_37), note [1](sbe1207.htm#fn_150).md) on an object
whilst holding a fire-brand or burning coal; or (according to the
Paddhati) in moving one's hand, which holds the burning coal, round the
oblation, from left to right. According to Kâty. II, 5, 22, the Adhvaryu
does so on the present occasion, whilst muttering the formula, 'Removed
is the Rakshas! removed are the enemies!' (Taitt. S. I, 1, 8, 1.) This
practice of paryagnikara*n*am may be compared with the carrying of fire
round houses, fields, boats, &c., on the last night of the year, a
custom which, according to Mr. A. Mitchell (The Past in the Present, p.
145), still prevails in some parts of Scotland, and which he thinks is
probably a survival of some form of fire-worship, and intended to secure
fertility and general prosperity. The obvious meaning of the ceremony
would seem to be the warding off of the dark and mischievous powers of
nature.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[46:1](sbe1208.htm#fr_168.md) On the upper side it
is baked by burning straw put on or held over it, whereby it takes a
crust (tva*k*, skin'). Schol. on Katy. II, 5, 23.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[46:2](sbe1208.htm#fr_169.md) With the name of no
other God the epithet deva ('shining,' 'God') is so frequently used as
with that of Savit*ri*: hence, according to the author's reasoning, it
is he that must be intended, whenever a god not otherwise specified is
alluded to.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[47:1](sbe1208.htm#fr_170.md) The washing of the
fingers and the dish, and has taken place after the putting on and
touching over of the cake, and before the paryagnikara*n*am is
performed.
