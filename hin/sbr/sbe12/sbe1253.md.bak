### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### III. THE PI*ND*APIT*RI*YA*GÑ*A OR OBLATION OF OBSEQUIAL CAKES TO THE FATHERS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:1">2:4:2:1</span></span>1. Now
the living beings once approached Pra*g*âpati--beings doubtless mean
creatures--and said, 'Ordain unto us in what manner we are to live!'
Thereupon the gods, being properly invested with the sacrificial
cord <span id="fr_800"></span>[1](#fn_796.md) and bending the right knee,
approached him. To them he said, 'The sacrifice (shall be) your food;
immortality your sap; and the sun your light!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:2">2:4:2:2</span></span>2. Then
the fathers approached, wearing the cord on the right shoulder, and
bending the left knee. To them he said, 'Your eating (shall be) monthly;
your cordial (svadhâ) your swiftness of thought; and the moon your
light!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:3">2:4:2:3</span></span>3. Then
the men approached him, clothed and bending their bodies. To them he
said, 'Your eating (shall be) in the evening and in the morning; your
offspring your death; and the fire (Agni) your light!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:4">2:4:2:4</span></span>4. Then
the beasts approached him. To them he granted their own choice, saying,
'Whensoever ye shall find anything, whether in season or out of season,

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

ye shall eat it!' Hence whenever they find anything, whether in season
or out of season, they eat it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:5">2:4:2:5</span></span>5.
Thereupon--so they say--the Asuras also straightway <span
id="fr_801"></span>[1](#fn_797.md) approached him. To them he gave darkness
(tamas) and illusion (mâyâ): for there is indeed what is called the
illusion of the Asuras. Those creatures, it is true, have perished; but
creatures still subsist here in the very manner which Pra*g*âpati
ordained unto them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:6">2:4:2:6</span></span>6.
Neither the gods, nor the fathers, nor beasts transgress (this
ordinance); some of the men alone transgress it. Hence whatever man
grows fat; he grows fat in unrighteousness, since he totters and is
unable to walk because of his having grown fat by doing wrong. One
should therefore eat only in the evening and morning; and whosoever,
knowing this, eats only in the evening and morning, reaches the full
measure of life; and whatever he speaks, that is (true); because he
observes that divine truth. For, verily, that is Brâhmanic lustre
(te*g*as), when one knows to keep His (Pra*g*âpati's) law.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:7">2:4:2:7</span></span>7. Now
that (lustre) indeed belongs to him who presents (food) to the fathers
once a month. When that (moon) is not seen either in the east or in the
west, then he presents (food) to them; for that moon doubtless is king
Soma, the food of the gods. Now during that night (of new moon) it fails
them, and when it fails, he presents (food to them), and thereby
establishes concord (between the gods and fathers). But were he to
present (food) to them when it is not failing, he would indeed cause a
quarrel between the gods and fathers: hence he presents

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (food) to them
when that (moon) is not seen either in the east or in the west.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:8">2:4:2:8</span></span>8. He
presents it in the afternoon. The forenoon, doubtless, belongs to the
gods; the mid-day to men; and the afternoon to the fathers: therefore he
presents (food to the fathers) in the afternoon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:9">2:4:2:9</span></span>9. While
seated behind the Gârhapatya, with his face turned toward the
south <span id="fr_802"></span>[1](#fn_798.md), and the sacrificial cord on
his right shoulder, he takes that (material for the offering from the
cart) <span id="fr_803"></span>[2](#fn_799.md). Thereupon he rises from
thence and threshes (the rice) while standing north of the Dakshi*n*a
fire and facing the south. Only once he cleans (the rice) <span
id="fr_804"></span>[3](#fn_800.md); for it is once for all that the fathers
have passed away, and therefore he cleans it only once.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:10">2:4:2:10</span></span>10. He
then boils it. While it stands on the (Dakshi*n*a) fire, he pours some
clarified butter on it;--for the gods they pour the offering into the
fire; for men they take (the food) off the fire; and for the fathers
they do in this very manner: hence, they pour the ghee on it while it
stands on the fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:11">2:4:2:11</span></span>11.
After removing it (from the fire) he offers to the gods two libations in
the fire. For, in establishing his sacrificial fires, and in performing
the new and full-moon sacrifice, that (householder) resorts to the gods.
Here, however, he is engaged in a

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

sacrifice to the fathers: hence he thereby propitiates the gods, and
being permitted by the gods, he presents that (food) to the fathers.
This is why, on removing (the rice), he offers to the gods two libations
in the fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:12">2:4:2:12</span></span>12. He
offers both to Agni and Soma <span id="fr_805"></span>[1](#fn_801.md). To
Agni he offers, because Agni is allowed a share in every (offering); and
to Soma he offers, because Soma is sacred to the fathers. This is why he
offers both to Agni and Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:13">2:4:2:13</span></span>13. He
offers <span id="fr_806"></span>[2](#fn_802.md) with the formulas (Vâ*g*.
S. II, 29 a, b), 'To Agni, the bearer of what is meet for the wise,
svâhâ!' 'To Soma, accompanied by the fathers, svâhâ <span
id="fr_807"></span>[3](#fn_803.md)!' He then puts the pot-ladle on the
fire,--that being in lieu of the Svish*t*ak*ri*t <span
id="fr_808"></span>[4](#fn_804.md). Thereupon he draws (with the wooden
sword) one line (furrow) south of the Dakshi*n*a fire <span
id="fr_809"></span>[5](#fn_805.md),--that

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

being in lieu of the altar: only one line he draws, because the fathers
have passed away once for all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:14">2:4:2:14</span></span>14. He
then lays down a firebrand at the farther (south) end (of the line). For
were he to present that (food) to the fathers, without having laid down
a firebrand, the Asuras and Rakshas would certainly tamper with it. And
thus the Asuras and Rakshas do not tamper with that (food) of the
fathers: this is why he lays down the firebrand at the farther end (of
the line).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:15">2:4:2:15</span></span>15. He
lays it down, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 30), 'Whatsoever Asuras roam
about at will <span id="fr_810"></span>[1](#fn_806.md), assuming various
shapes <span id="fr_811"></span>[2](#fn_807.md),--be they large-bodied or
small-bodied <span id="fr_812"></span>[3](#fn_808.md),--may Agni expel them
from this world!' Agni is the repeller of the Rakshas, and therefore he
lays (the firebrand) down in this way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:16">2:4:2:16</span></span>16. He
then takes the water-pitcher and makes (the fathers) wash (their hands
) <span id="fr_813"></span>[4](#fn_809.md), merely <span
id="fr_814"></span>[5](#fn_810) saying, 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming.md)
the sacrificer's father; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his grandfather;
'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his great-grandfather. As one would pour
out water (for a guest) when he is about to take food, so in this case.

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:17">2:4:2:17</span></span>17. Now
those (stalks of sacrificial grass) are severed with one stroke, and cut
off near the root;--the top belongs to the gods, the middle part to men,
and the root-part to the fathers: therefore they are cut off near the
root. And with one stroke they are severed, because the fathers have
passed away once for all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:18">2:4:2:18</span></span>18. He
spreads them (along the line) with their tops towards the south. Thereon
he presents \[to the fathers the three (round) cakes of rice\] <span
id="fr_815"></span>[1](#fn_811.md). He presents them thus <span
id="fr_816"></span>[2](#fn_812.md);--for to the gods they offer thus; for
men they ladle out (the food in any way they please) <span
id="fr_817"></span>[3](#fn_813.md); and in the case of the fathers they do
in this very way: therefore he presents (the cakes to them) thus.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:19">2:4:2:19</span></span>19.
With, 'N.N., this for thee!' he presents (one cake) to the sacrificer's
father. Some add, 'and for those who come after thee!' but let him not
say this, since he himself is one of those to whom (it would be offered)
in common <span id="fr_818"></span>[4](#fn_814.md): let him

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

therefore merely say, 'N.N., this for thee!' as to the sacrificer's
father; 'N.N., this for thee!' as to his grandfather; and 'N.N., this
for thee!' as to his great-grandfather. He presents (the food) in an
order (directed) away from the present time, because it is away from
hence that the fathers have once for all departed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:20">2:4:2:20</span></span>20. He
then mutters (Vâ*g*. S. II, 31 a), 'Here, O fathers, regale yourselves:
like bulls come hither, each to his own share!' whereby he says, 'Eat ye
each his own share!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:21">2:4:2:21</span></span>21. He
then turns round (to the left), so as to face the opposite (north) side:
for the fathers are far away from men; and thereby he also is far away
(from the fathers). 'Let him remain (standing with bated breath) until
his breath fail,' say some, 'for thus far extends the vital energy.'
However <span id="fr_819"></span>[1](#fn_815.md), having remained so for a
moment--

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:22">2:4:2:22</span></span>22. He
again turns round (to the right) and mutters (Vâ*g*. S. II, 31 b), 'The
fathers have regaled themselves: like bulls they have come each to his
own share;' whereby he means to say, 'They have eaten each his own
share <span id="fr_820"></span>[2](#fn_816.md).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:23">2:4:2:23</span></span>23.
Thereupon he takes the water-pitcher and makes them wash
themselves <span id="fr_821"></span>[3](#fn_817.md), merely saying,

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'N.N., wash
thyself <span id="fr_822"></span>[1](#fn_818)!' (naming.md) the
sacrificer's father; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his grandfather;
'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his great-grandfather. Even as one would
pour out (water for a guest) when he has taken his meal, so here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:2:24">2:4:2:24</span></span>24. He
then pulls down the tuck <span id="fr_823"></span>[2](#fn_819.md) (of the
sacrificer's garment) and performs obeisance. The tuck is sacred to the
fathers (pit*ri*devatyâ): therefore he performs obeisance to them after
pulling down the tuck. Now obeisance means worship (or sacrifice): hence
he thereby renders them worthy of worship. Six times he performs
obeisance; for there are six seasons, and the fathers are the seasons:
for this reason he performs obeisance six times. He mutters (Vâ*g*. S.
II, 32 g), 'Give us houses, O fathers!' for the fathers are the
guardians (î*s*ate) of houses; and this is the prayer for blessing at
this sacrificial performance. After the cakes have been put back (in the
dish containing the remains of boiled rice) he (the sacrificer) smells
at (the rice); this (smelling) being the sacrificer's share. The

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (stalks of
sacrificial grass) cut with one stroke he puts on the fire; and he also
again throws away the firebrand <span id="fr_824"></span>[1](#fn_820.md).

<span id="fn_796"></span>[361:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_800.md) Ya*gñ*opavîtin,
'sacrificially invested,' i.e. wearing the sacrificial cord in the
ordinary way, on the left shoulder and under the right arm. In any
performance connected with the deceased ancestors, the cord has to be
shifted from the left to the right shoulder and under the left arm
(prâ*k*înopavîtin, lit. 'eastward invested').

<span id="fn_797"></span>[362:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_801.md) *S*a*s*vat =
'repeatedly,' Comm.; *s*a*s*vad api, 'endlich auch (at last also),' St.
Petersb. Dict.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[363:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_802.md) Dakshi*n*âsîna*h*;
the Commentator interprets it by 'sitting south of the cart.'

<span id="fn_799"></span>[363:2](sbe1253.htm#fr_803.md) The Kâ*n*va text
has,--eta*m* *k*aru*m* g*ri*h*n*âti, 'he takes that pot, or potful, (of
rice).' Doubtless, he is to take from the cart the quantity of rice
sufficient for the offerings and put it in the pot (*k*aru). According
to Kâty. IV, I, 5-7 he is to take the but-partly-filled pot, or a
spoonful (or, according to the Schol., rather less than a spoonful).

<span id="fn_800"></span>[363:3](sbe1253.htm#fr_804.md) Compare the
detailed account in I, 1, 4, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[364:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_805.md) According to Taitt.
Br. I, 3, 10, 3, some make a third oblation, viz. as Sâya*n*a states, to
Yama (the chief of the fathers), with the formula, 'To Yama, accompanied
by the Aṅgiras and fathers, svadhâ! nama*h*!' see note 3.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[364:2](sbe1253.htm#fr_806.md) The commentary on
Kâty. IV, 1, 7 supplies the following particulars:--Having removed the
pot off the Dakshi*n*a fire on the south side, the Adhvaryu takes it,
along the east, to the north side of the fire. He then shifts the
sacrificial cord to his left shoulder (as he is about to offer to gods),
puts three sticks on the fire, and sitting down with his face towards
the east offers some boiled rice with the pot-ladle (meksha*n*a).

<span id="fn_803"></span>[364:3](sbe1253.htm#fr_807.md) The Taittirîyas use
svadhâ! nama*h* instead of svâhâ! They also offer first to Soma, with
'To Soma, drank by the fathers' (but cf. Taitt. Br. I, 6, 9, 5), and
then to (Yama, and finally to) Agni. Taitt. Br. I, 3, 10, 2-3.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[364:4](sbe1253.htm#fr_808.md) See I, 7, 3, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[364:5](sbe1253.htm#fr_809.md) Or west
(*g*aghanena) of the fire \[from north to south\], according to the
Kâ*n*va text; optionally, according to Kâty. IV, 1, 8. Kâty. also gives
the text 'Expelled are the Asuras, the Rakshas, seated on the altar'
(Vâ*g*. S. II, 29 c) to be muttered during the act.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[365:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_810.md) Or, as the
Commentator takes svadhayâ, '(attracted) by the svadhâ (offering to the
fathers).'

<span id="fn_807"></span>[365:2](sbe1253.htm#fr_811.md) That is, according
to the Schol., assuming the shapes of deceased ancestors.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[365:3](sbe1253.htm#fr_812.md) This explanation of
the words parâpura*h* and nipura*h*, proposed by the Scholiast, is
doubtful.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[365:4](sbe1253.htm#fr_813.md) The Adhvaryu
(having again shifted the sacrificial cord to his right shoulder) pours
water through the "fathers' space" (pit*ri*tîrtha, i.e. the space
between the thumb and fore-finger), from right to left, into the line,
at its beginning, centre, and end. Kâty. IV, 1, 10, and Schol.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[365:5](sbe1253.htm#fr_814.md) See paragraph 19.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[366:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_815.md) According to the
Paddhati on Kâty. the first ball is to be of the size of a fresh
âmalaka, or fruit of the Emblic Myrobalan, and each of the two others is
to be larger than the preceding one.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[366:2](sbe1253.htm#fr_816.md) Here the teacher
indicated by gesture the part of the hand sacred to the fathers (see [p.
365](#page_365), note [4](#fn_809).md); and then in the same way that
dedicated to the gods, viz. the tip of the fingers.

<span id="fn_813"></span>[366:3](sbe1253.htm#fr_817.md) The Kâ*n*va
recension reads here also 'thus they take out (the food) for men;' the
part of the hand dedicated to man being, according to the commentary on
Kâty. IV, 1, 10, the part about the little finger
(kanish*th*ikâprade*s*a).

<span id="fn_814"></span>[366:4](sbe1253.htm#fr_818.md) Svaya*m* vai
teshâ*m* saha yeshâ*m* saha. According to the commentary, the author
apparently means to say, that if he were to add, 'and those who come
after thee (i.e. after his father),' he would include the sacrificer
himself, and the latter would consequently offer the pi*nd*a to himself.
The form of the presentation-formula rejected by our author is the one
adopted in Â*s*val. *S*r. II, 6, 15, except that 'atra' is added there
('who here come after thee'). <span id="page_367">p. 367</span> The
Kâ*n*va text mentions and rejects the two alternative readings, 'ye *k*a
tvâm anvâ*ñk*a*h*' and 'yâ*ms* *k*a tvam anvaṅ asi' ('and those whom
thou followest'). In Taitt. Br. I, 3, 10, no presentation-formula is
mentioned at all.

<span id="fn_815"></span>[367:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_819.md) The Kâ*n*va
recension has tad u instead of sa vai.

<span id="fn_816"></span>[367:2](sbe1253.htm#fr_820.md) 'Formerly the gods
and men and fathers (deva-manushyâ*h* pitara*h*) drank visibly together,
but now they do so invisibly.' *S*at. Br. III, 6, 2, 26.

<span id="fn_817"></span>[367:3](sbe1253.htm#fr_821.md) Viz. by pouring
water on the obsequial cakes. According to Â*s*val. Sr. II, 7, 5, and
other treatises, he also puts down some <span id="page_368">p.
368</span> ointment, oil, or butter on the pi*nd*as, saying, '(Father),
N.N., anoint thyself!' &c.; see Donner, Pi*nd*ap., p. 25.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[368:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_822.md) See paragraph 19.

<span id="fn_819"></span>[368:2](sbe1253.htm#fr_823.md) Nîvim udv*ri*hya =
paridhânîyasya vâsaso da*s*â tâm udv*ri*hya visra*m*sya, Sâya*n*a.
According to Mahâdeva, he (who presents the pi*nd*as, viz. either the
Adhvaryu or the sacrificer) has previously to put on a garment with a
tuck (nîvimat paridhânam), i.e. with the da*s*â, or unwoven edge of the
upper garment, tucked up under the waistband. This he is to pull out.
Kâtyâyana has the following rules: IV, I, 15, Having made (them) wash
themselves as before, and having loosened (visra*m*sya) the tuck, he
makes obeisance with 'adoration to your vigour, O fathers!' &c. (Vâ*g*.
S. II, 32 a-f). \[According to the Comm., he adds the formula, 'Give us
houses, O fathers! we will give to you of what is (ours).' Vâ*g*. S. II,
32, 9.\] 16, With 'Put on this your garment, O fathers!' (Vâ*g*. S. II,
32 h), he throws three threads (pieces of <span id="page_369">p.
369</span> yarn), one on each cake. 17, Or, woollen fringe \[or, wool or
fringe (da*s*â), according to others\]. 18, Or, hairs of the sacrificer
(pulled out from the chest near the heart), if he is advanced in years.
19, He pours \[the water, left in the pitcher, on the cakes\] with 'Ye
(O waters) are a refreshing draught, ye, that bring sap, immortal ghee
and milk and foaming mead: gladden my fathers!' (Vâ*g*. S. II, 34.) 20,
\[The Adhvaryu\] having laid (the cakes on the dish) the sacrificer
smells at them. 21, The firebrand and the once-cut stalks of grass (he
throws) into the fire. 22, The wife, if desirous of a son, eats the
middle cake with, 'Bestow offspring on me, O fathers, a boy crowned with
lotuses; that there may he a man here!' (Vâ*g*. S. II, 33.) \[According
to the comment, the other two cakes are thrown into the water or fire;
or eaten by a priest.\] For other variations, see Donner,
Pi*nd*apit*ri*ya*gñ*a. The Kâ*n*va recension, on the whole, agrees with
our text.

<span id="fn_820"></span>[369:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_824.md) The Kâ*n*va text
has as follows: 'Therefore he says, Give us houses, O fathers!' He then
smells at the pot (ukhâ): that is the sacrificer's share. They again put
down the cakes together (with the rice in the pot! samavadadhati). The
once-severed (stalks of grass) they put on the fire. The firebrand he
again shifts to (the fire; apy-ar*g*ati).
