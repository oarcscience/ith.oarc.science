### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE CHIEF OFFERINGS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:1">1:7:2:1</span></span>1.
Verily, whoever exists, he, in being born, is born as (owing) a debt to
the gods, to the *Ri*shis, to the fathers, and to men <span
id="fr_440"></span>[1](#fn_437.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:2">1:7:2:2</span></span>2. For,
inasmuch as he is bound to sacrifice, for that reason he is born as
(owing) a debt to the gods: hence when he sacrifices to them, when he
makes

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

offerings to them, he does this (in discharge of his debt) to them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:3">1:7:2:3</span></span>3. And
further, inasmuch as he is bound to study (the Veda), for that reason he
is born as (owing) a debt to the *Ri*shis: hence it is to them that he
does this; for one who has studied (the Veda) they call 'the *Ri*shis'
treasure-warden.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:4">1:7:2:4</span></span>4. And
further, inasmuch as he is bound to wish for offspring, for that reason
he is born as (owing) a debt to the fathers: hence when there is
(provided by him) a continued, uninterrupted lineage, it is for them
that he does this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:5">1:7:2:5</span></span>5. And
further, inasmuch as he is bound to practise hospitality, for that
reason he is born as (owing) a debt to men: hence when he harbours them,
when he offers food to them, it is (in discharge of his debt) to them
that he does so. Whoever does all these things, has discharged his
duties: by him all is obtained, all is conquered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:6">1:7:2:6</span></span>6. And,
accordingly, in that he is born as (owing) a debt to the gods, in regard
to that he satisfies (ava-day) them by sacrificing; and when he makes
offerings in the fire, he thereby satisfies them in regard to that
(debt): hence whatever they offer up in the fire, is called avadânam
(sacrificial portion) <span id="fr_441"></span>[1](#fn_438.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:7">1:7:2:7</span></span>7. Now
this (oblation) consists of four cuttings; (the reason for this is,
that) there is here first, the invitatory prayer (anuvâkyâ), then the
offering-prayer (yâ*g*yâ), then the vasha*t*-call, and as the fourth,
the deity for which the sacrificial food is

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (destined): for in
this way the deities are dependent on the sacrificial portions, or the
portions are dependent on the deities: hence what fifth cutting there is
(made by some), that is redundant, for--for whom is he to cut it? For
this reason it consists of four cuttings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:8">1:7:2:8</span></span>8. But a
fivefold cutting also takes place (with some people): fivefold is the
sacrifice, fivefold the animal victim, and five seasons there are in the
year,--such is the perfection of the fivefold cutting; and he,
assuredly, will have abundant offspring and cattle for whom, knowing
this, the fivefold cutting is made. The fourfold cutting, however, is
the approved (practice) among the Kuru-Pa*ñk*âlas, and for this reason a
fourfold cutting takes place (with us <span
id="fr_442"></span>[1](#fn_439).md).

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:9">1:7:2:9</span></span>9. Let
him cut off only a moderate quantity; for were he to cut off a large
quantity, he would make it human; and what is human is inauspicious at
the sacrifice. Let him therefore cut off only a moderate quantity, lest
he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:10">1:7:2:10</span></span>10.
Having made an under-layer of butter (in the *g*uhû-spoon) and cut off
twice from the havis, he then pours over it some butter. There are,
indeed, two (kinds of) oblations; the oblation of Soma being one, and
the oblation of (or rather, with) butter being the other. Now the one,
viz. the Soma-oblation, is (an oblation) by itself; and the other, viz.
the butter-oblation, is the same as the offering of havis (rice, milk,
&c.) and the animal offering <span id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_440.md);
hence he thereby makes it (the cake) butter, and therefore butter is on
both sides of it. Butter, doubtless, is palatable to the gods; hence he
thereby renders it palatable to the gods: for this reason butter is on
both sides of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:11">1:7:2:11</span></span>11. The
invitatory prayer (anuvâkyâ, f.), doubtless, is yonder (sky), and the
offering-prayer (yâ*g*yâ, f.) is this (earth)--these two are females.
With each of these two the vasha*t*-call (vasha*t*kâra, m.) makes up a
pair <span id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_441.md). Now the vasha*t*, indeed,

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

is no other than that scorching one (the sun). When he rises he
approaches yonder (sky); and when he sets he approaches this (earth):
hence whatever is brought forth here by these two, that they bring forth
through that male.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:12">1:7:2:12</span></span>12.
Having recited the invitatory prayer and pronounced the
offering-prayer <span id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_442.md), he afterwards
(pa*sk*ât) utters the vasha*t* formula; for from behind (pa*sk*ât) the
male approaches the female: hence, after placing those two in front, he
causes them to be approached by that male, the vasha*t*. For the same
reason let him make the offering either simultaneously with the vasha*t*
or (immediately) after the vasha*t* has been pronounced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:13">1:7:2:13</span></span>13. A
vessel of the gods, doubtless, is that vasha*t*. Even as, after ladling,
one would mete out (food) into a vessel, so here. If, on the other hand,
he were to make the offering before the vasha*t*, it would be lost, as
would be that (food) falling to the ground: for this reason also let him
make the offering either simultaneously with the vasha*t* or after it
has been pronounced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:14">1:7:2:14</span></span>14. As
seed is poured into the womb, so here. If, on the other hand, he were to
make the offering before the vasha*t*, it would be lost, as would be the
seed poured not into the womb: for this reason also let him make the
offering either simultaneously with the vasha*t* or after it has been
pronounced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:15">1:7:2:15</span></span>15. The
invitatory formula, doubtless, is yonder (sky), and the offering-formula
is this (earth). The gâyatrî metre also is this (earth), and the
trish*t*ubh

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

is yonder (sky) <span id="fr_446"></span>[1](#fn_443.md) He recites the
gâyatrî verse, thereby reciting yonder (sky), for the invitatory formula
(anuvâkyâ) is yonder (sky). He recites this (earth), for the gâyatrî
verse (viz. the offering-formula) is this (earth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:16">1:7:2:16</span></span>16. He
then presents the offering with a trish*t*ubh verse <span
id="fr_447"></span>[2](#fn_444.md), thereby presenting it by means of this

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (earth), for the
offering-formula (yâ*g*yâ) is this (earth). Over yonder (sky) he places
the vasha*t*, for yonder (sky) also is the trish*t*ubh. Thereby he makes
those two (sky and earth) yoke-fellows; and as such they feed together;
and after their common meal all these creatures get food <span
id="fr_448"></span>[1](#fn_445.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:17">1:7:2:17</span></span>17. Let
him pronounce the invitatory formula lingering, as it were: the
invitatory formula, namely, is yonder (sky), and the b*ri*hat(-sâman)
also is yonder (sky), since its form is that of the b*ri*hat. With the
offering-formula let him, as it were, hurry on fast: the
offering-formula, doubtless, is this (earth), and the rathantara(-sâman)
also is this (earth), since its form is that of the rathantara <span
id="fr_449"></span>[2](#fn_446.md). With the invitatory formula he calls
(the gods), and with the

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

offering-formula he presents (food to them): hence the invitatory
formula (anuvâkyâ) has some such form as 'I call,' 'We call,' 'Come
hither!' 'Sit on the barhis!' for with it he calls. With the
offering-formula (yâ*g*yâ) he offers: hence the offering-formula has
some such form as, 'Accept the sacrificial food!' 'Relish the
sacrificial food!' 'Accept the potation (âv*ri*shâyasva)!' 'Eat! Drink!
There <span id="fr_450"></span>[1](#fn_447.md)!' for by it he offers that
which (is indicated by) 'there!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:18">1:7:2:18</span></span>18. Let
the invitatory formula be one that has its distinctive indication (in
the form of the name of the respective deity) at the beginning (in
front): for the invitatory formula is yonder (sky); and that (sky)
yonder has the moon, the stars, and the sun for its mark below <span
id="fr_451"></span>[2](#fn_448.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:19">1:7:2:19</span></span>19. The
offering-formula then should be one that has its characteristic
indication (further) back <span id="fr_452"></span>[3](#fn_449.md); for the
offering-formula is this (earth), and this same (earth) has plants,
trees, waters, fire, and these creatures for its mark above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:20">1:7:2:20</span></span>20.
Verily, that invitatory formula alone is auspicious, in the first word
of which he utters the (name of the) deity; and that offering-formula
alone is auspicious in the last word of which he pronounces the vasha*t*
upon the deity <span id="fr_453"></span>[4](#fn_450.md); for the (name

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

of the) deity constitutes the vigour of the *Rik* (verse): hence after
thus enclosing it <span id="fr_454"></span>[1](#fn_451.md) on both sides
with vigour, he offers the sacrificial food to that deity for which it
is intended.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:21">1:7:2:21</span></span>21. He
pronounces (the syllable) vauk <span id="fr_455"></span>[2](#fn_452.md);
for, assuredly, the vasha*t*-call is speech; and speech means seed:
hence he thereby casts seed. 'Sha*t*' (he pronounces), because there are
six seasons: he thereby casts that seed into the seasons, and the
seasons cause that seed so cast to spring up here as creatures. This is
the reason why he pronounces the vasha*t*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:22">1:7:2:22</span></span>22. Now
the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, entered
upon their father Pra*g*âpati's inheritance <span
id="fr_456"></span>[3](#fn_453.md), to wit, these two half-moons. The gods
entered upon the one which waxes, and the Asuras on the one which wanes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:23">1:7:2:23</span></span>23. The
gods were desirous as to how they might appropriate also the one that
had fallen to the Asuras. They went on worshipping and toiling. They saw
this havirya*gñ*a, to wit, the new- and full-moon sacrifices, and
performed them; and by performing them they likewise appropriated the
one--

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:24">1:7:2:24</span></span>24.
Which belonged to the Asuras. Now when these two revolve, then the month
is produced; and month (revolving) after month, the year (is produced).
But the year, doubtless, means all; hence the gods thereby appropriated
all that belonged to

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

the Asuras, they deprived their enemies, the Asuras, of all. And in the
same way he (the sacrificer) who knows this appropriates all that
belongs to his enemies, deprives his enemies of all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:25">1:7:2:25</span></span>25.
That (half-moon) which belonged to the gods is (called) yavan, for the
gods possessed themselves (yu, 'to join') of it; and that which belonged
to the Asuras is ayavan, because the Asuras did not possess themselves
of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:2:26">1:7:2:26</span></span>26. But
they also say contrariwise:--That which belonged to the gods is (called)
ayavan, because the Asuras did not get possession of it; and that which
belonged to the Asuras is yavan, because the gods did get possession of
it. The day is (called) sabda, the night sagarâ, the months yavya, the
year sumeka <span id="fr_457"></span>[1](#fn_454.md): sveka ('eminently
one'), doubtless, is the same as sumeka. And since the Hot*ri* is
concerned with these--to wit, the yavan and the ayavan, which (according
to some) is yavan--they call (his office) yâvihotram <span
id="fr_458"></span>[2](#fn_455.md).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_437"></span>[190:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_440.md) The wording of this
passage is very ambiguous; so much so indeed, that it could also be
taken in the sense that 'whoever exists, is born as (one to whom) a debt
(is owed) from the gods,' &c.; cf. I, 1, 2, 19: 'Whichever deities are
chosen (for the oblations), they consider it as a debt (clue from them),
that they are bound to fulfil whatever wish he entertains while taking
the oblation.' But see Taitt. Br. VI, 3, 10, 5: 'Verily, a Brâhma*n*a
who is born, is born as owing a debt in respect to three things: in the
shape of sacred study (brahma*k*arya) to the *Ri*shis, in the shape of
sacrifice to the gods, and in the shape of offspring to the fathers.
Free from debt, verily, is he who has a son, who is a sacrificer, who
lives (for a time with a guru) as a religious student.' Ath.-veda VI,
117, 3 (Taitt. Br. III, 7, 9, 8): 'May we be debtless in this, debtless
in the other, debtless in the third, world! What worlds (paths, Taitt.
Br.) there are trodden by the gods and trodden by the fathers,--may we
abide debtless on all (those) paths!'

<span id="fn_438"></span>[191:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_441.md) The word is really
derived from ava-dâ (do), 'to cut off.' The Taitt. Br. gives the same
fanciful etymological explanation of the term as here.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[192:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_442.md) The four 'cuttings'
of which each oblation of rice-cake consists are made in the following
way: first, some clarified butter, 'cut out' or drawn from the butter in
the dhruvâ-spoon by means of the sruva (dipping-spoon) and poured into
the *g*uhû (this is called the upastara*n*a or under-layer of butter);
second and third, two pieces of the size of a thumb's joint, cut out
from the centre and the fore-part of the rice-cake and laid on that
butter; and fourth, some clarified butter poured on these pieces of cake
(the technical name of this basting of butter being abhighâra*n*a). The
family of the *G*amadagnis, which is mentioned as always making five
cuttings (Kâty. I, 9, 3-4), take three pieces of cake instead of two,
viz. an additional one from the back (or west) part of the cake.
Yâ*gñ*ika Deva on Kâty. quotes a couplet from some Sm*ri*ti, in which
the Vatsas, the Vidas, and the Ârsh*t*ishe*n*as are mentioned beside the
*G*amadagnis, as pa*ñk*âvattina*h* or making five cuttings. At the
Upâ*ms*uyâ*g*a (low-voiced offering),--which is performed between the
cake-oblation to Agni and that to Agni-Soma at the full moon, and
between the cake-oblation to Agni and that to Indra-Agni (or the
sânnâyya, or oblation of sweet and sour milk, to Indra) at the new moon,
and which consists entirely of butter,--the four cuttings are effected
in the same way as described <span id="page_193">p. 193</span> page
[174](sbe1228.htm#page_174) note. At the sânnâyya, two (or three.md)
sruva-fuls of both the sweet and the sour milk take the place of the two
(or three) pieces of cake.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[193:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_443.md) See page
[26](sbe1206.htm#page_26), note [1](sbe1206.htm#fn_125.md). The parts of
the cakes or the sânnâyya, from which cuttings have been made, he
bastes, each once, with butter taken with the sruva from the butter-pot;
and whenever butter is ladled with the sruva from the dhruvâ into the
*g*uhû, the former is replenished from the butter-pot.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[193:2](sbe1231.htm#fr_444.md) Tayor mithunam asti
vasha*t*kâra eva, 'to these two the vasha*t*-call is the complement in
forming a pair.' On the vasha*t* (vausha*t*) and the other two formulas,
see note on I, 5, 2, 16.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[194:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_445.md) The usual
formalities, which have been detailed before (see page
[174](sbe1228.htm#page_174) note.md), have, of course, to be gone through
at each oblation.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[195:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_446.md) In this passage the
invitatory formula (anuvâkyâ or puro'nuvâkyâ), which is in the gâyatrî
metre, is identified with the sky, and the offering-formula (yâ*g*yâ),
which is in the trish*t*ubh metre, with the earth. On the other hand,
the gâyatrî also is the earth (cf. I, 4, I, 34), and the trish*t*ubh the
sky; so that, according to this mode of reasoning, there is not only an
intimate connection between the two metres, but actual identity. The
gâyatrî verse, used as invitatory formula, on the occasion of the
rice-cake offering to Agni, is Rig-veda VIII, 4.4, 16 \[agnir mûrdhâ
diva*h* kakut, 'Agni, the head and summit of the sky,' &c.\]; with that
to Agni and Soma, at the full-moon sacrifice, Rig-veda I, 93, 3
\[agnîshomau savedasau, sahûtî vanatam gira*h*, 'O Agni and Soma, of
self-same wealth and invocation, accept this song!' &c.\]; and to Indra
and Agni, at the new moon, Rig-veda VII, 94, 7 \[indrâgnî avasâ gatam,
'O Indra and Agni, come to us with favour I' &c.\] or with the
(optional) milk-offering (sânnâyyam), at the new moon, Rig-veda I, 8, 1
\[endra sânasi*m* rayim, hither, O Indra, bring abundant treasure!!'
&c.\], if to Indra; or Rig-veda VIII, 6, 1 \[mahâṅ indro ya o*g*asâ
par*g*anyo v*ri*sh*t*imâṅ iva, 'the Great Indra, who in might is equal
to the rainy thunder-cloud,' &c.\], if to Mahendra.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[195:2](sbe1231.htm#fr_447.md) The trish*t*ubh
verse, used as offering-formula with the oblation of cake to Agni, both
at the new and full moon, is Rig-veda X, 8, 6 \[bhuvo ya*gñ*asya
ra*g*asa*s* *k*a netâ . . . agne . . ., 'be thou the leader of the
sacrifice and welkin, . . . O Agni!' &c.\]; with that to Agni and Soma,
at the full moon, Rig-veda I, 93, 5 \[yuvam etâni divi ro*k*anâni . . .
agnîshomau . . ., 'you, O Agni and Soma, (fixed) those lights in the
heaven,' &c.\]; with that to Indra and Agni, at the new moon, Rig-veda
VII, 93 4 \[gîrbhir vipra*h* pramatim i*kkh*amâna, .. indrâgnî . . .,
'the bard, seeking your grace by songs . . ., O Indra and Agni,' &c.\];
and with the milk-offering, at the same sacrifice, if to Indra, Rig-veda
X, 180, 1 \[pra sasâhishe puruhûta *s*atrûn . . . indrâ . . ., thou, O
Indra, the much-invoked, hast vanquished the enemies!' &c.\]; or, if to
Mahendra, Rig-veda X, 50, 4 \[bhuvas <span id="page_196">p. 196</span>
tvam indra brahma*n*â mahân, 'mighty, O Indra, mayest thou be through
(our) prayer!' &c.\].

<span id="fn_445"></span>[196:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_448.md) For the notion that
there is rain (and consequently food) when heaven and earth are on
friendly terms with each other, see I, 8, 3, 12. The rain is the food of
the earth; and the food, produced thereby, in its turn furnishes food
for the sky (or the gods) in the form of oblations.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[196:2](sbe1231.htm#fr_449.md) The b*ri*hat-sâman
(tvam id dhi havâmahe, 'on thee, indeed, we call,' &c., Sâma-veda II,
159-160 = Rig-veda VI, 46, 1-2) and the rathantara-sâman (abhi tvâ
*s*ûra nonuma*h*, 'to thee, O Hero, we call,' &c., Sâma-veda II, 30-31 =
Rig-veda VII, 32, 22-23) are two of the most highly prized Sâma-hymns,
which are especially used in forming the so-called p*ri*sh*th*as, or
combinations of two hymns in such a way that one of them (being a mystic
representation of the embryo) is enclosed in the other, which is
supposed to represent the womb. In these symbolical combinations the
b*ri*hat and rathantara, which must never be used together, are often
employed as the enclosing chants, representative of the womb. They are
already mentioned in Rig-veda X, 181. See also *S*at. Br. IX, 1, 2,
36-37. Taitt. S. VII, 1, I, 4, Pra*g*âpati is said to have first created
from his mouth Agni together with the Gâyatrî, the Rathantara-sâman, the
Brâhma*n*a, and the goat; and then from his chest and arms Indra, the
Trish*t*ubh, the B*ri*hat-sâman, the Râ*g*anya, and the ram.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[197:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_450.md) Literally,
'forwards, thither (pra).'

<span id="fn_448"></span>[197:2](sbe1231.htm#fr_451.md) Avastâllakshma,
'the sign below or on this (the, to us, nearest or front) side.' See the
formulas above, [p. 195](#page_195), note [1](#fn_443.md).

<span id="fn_449"></span>[197:3](sbe1231.htm#fr_452.md) Or upwards, on the
upper side, uparish*t*âllaksha*n*am. See the offering-formulas above,
[p. 195](#page_195), note [2](#fn_444.md).

<span id="fn_450"></span>[197:4](sbe1231.htm#fr_453.md) Vasha*t*, or rather
vâusha*t* \['may he (Agni) carry it (to the gods)!'\], is pronounced
after each yâ*g*yâ or offering-formula, which contains the name of the
deity towards the end, or at least not at the very beginning.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[198:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_454.md) Viz. the invitatory
and offering-formulas.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[198:2](sbe1231.htm#fr_455.md) The sacrificial
call vausha*t* (for vasha*t*, irregular aorist of vah, 'to bear,' cf.
[p. 88](sbe1214.htm#page_88), note [2](sbe1214.htm#fn_254).md) is here
fancifully explained as composed of vauk, for vâk, 'speech,' + sha*t*,
'six.'

<span id="fn_453"></span>[198:3](sbe1231.htm#fr_456.md) Pra*g*âpati, or
Lord of Creatures, is here, as often (cf. I, 2, 5, 13), taken as
representing the year, or Time.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[199:1](sbe1231.htm#fr_457.md) Sumeka is taken by
the St. Petersburg Dictionary to mean 'firmly established;' by
Grassmann, 'bountiful,' literally 'well-showering.' Our author
identifies it with su-eka. The words sabdam (*s*abdam, Kâ*n*va rec., ? =
the sounding one) and sagarâ are obscure; yavya here apparently means,
'consisting of the yavas or half-months.'

<span id="fn_455"></span>[199:2](sbe1231.htm#fr_458.md) The term yâvihotram
is obscure, and does not seem to occur anywhere else. The Kâ*n*va MS.
reads yâmihotram (? = *g*âmihotram). Sâya*n*a's comment is corrupt in
several places and affords little help.
