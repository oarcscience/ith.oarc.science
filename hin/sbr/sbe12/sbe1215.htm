The middle stick he lays down first (on the west side of the fire), with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 3), 'May the Gandharva Vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;vasu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> lay thee around</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:3:4:3">1:3:4:3</A></FONT></span>3. He then lays down the southern one, with the text (ib.), 'Thou art Indra's arm for the security of the All! Thou art a fence to the sacrificer; thou Agni, invoked and worthy of invocation!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:3:4:4">1:3:4:4</A></FONT></span>4. He then lays down the northern one, with the text (ib.), 'May Mitra-Varu<I>n</I>a lay thee around in the north with firm law for the security of the All! Thou art a fence to the sacrificer, thou Agni, invoked and worthy of invocation!' They are indeed Agnis, and for that reason he says, 'Agni, invoked and worthy of invocation!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:3:4:5">1:3:4:5</A></FONT></span>5. Thereupon he puts on (the fire) a samidh (kindling-stick). He first touches with it the middle enclosing-stick: thereby he first kindles those (three Agnis). After that he puts it on the fire: thereby he kindles the visible fire.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:3:4:6">1:3:4:6</A></FONT></span>6. He puts it on&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_259"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with the g&acirc;yatr&icirc; stanza (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S.

He thereby kindles the g&acirc;yatr&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_259"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; the g&acirc;yatr&icirc;, when kindled, kindles the other metres; and the metres, when kindled, carry the sacrifice to the gods.</p>

By the second kindling-stick (samidh), which he now puts on, he kindles the spring; the spring, when kindled, kindles the other seasons; and the seasons, when kindled, cause living beings to be produced and the plants to ripen. He puts it on, with the formula (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 5), 'A kindler (samidh) art thou!' for the spring is indeed a kindler.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:3:4:8">1:3:4:8</A></FONT></span>8. When he has put it on, he murmurs (ib.), 'May the sun guard thee from the east against any imprecation!' for the enclosing-sticks serve for protection on all (the other three) sides; and thereby he makes the sun the protector on the east side, fearing 'lest the evil spirits, the Rakshas, should rush in from the east:' for the sun is the repeller of the evil spirits, the Rakshas.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:3:4:9">1:3:4:9</A></FONT></span>9. By that third kindling-stick, then, which he puts on at the after-offerings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_261"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he kindles the officiating priest (br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a); and he, the priest, when kindled, carries the sacrifice to the gods.</p>

Having taken two stalks of grass, he lays them down across (the barhis or grass covering, with the tops to the north), with the formula (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 5), 'Savit<I>ri</I>'s arms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_261"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are ye!' The prastara bunch is indeed the top-knot (of the sacrifice); and he now lays down these two crosswise as its eye-brows: thereby these two (represent) the transverse eye-brows. The prastara, further,</p>

<p><A NAME="page_93"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 93</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (represents) the kshatra (or military class); and the other barhis the vi<I>s</I> (or, the common &Acirc;ryan people);--(and the two stalks he puts down between them) for the sake of separating (vidh<I>ri</I>ti) the kshatra and the vi<I>s</I>: for this reason he lays them down crosswise; and for this reason these two (stalks) are called vidh<I>ri</I>ti.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:3:4:11">1:3:4:11</A></FONT></span>11. On them he spreads the prastara, with the formula (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 5), 'I spread thee, soft as wool, pleasant to sit upon for the gods!' When he says 'thee, soft as wool,' he means to say 'agreeable to the gods;' and by 'pleasant to sit upon for the gods' he means to say 'forming a good seat for the gods.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:3:4:12">1:3:4:12</A></FONT></span>12. He presses it down (with his left hand), with the text (ib.), 'May the Vasus, the Rudras, the &Acirc;dityas sit on thee!' These three, that is, the Vasus, the Rudras, and the &Acirc;dityas, namely, are (classes of) gods; and these, he means to say, are to sit down on it. While it is still being held down with his left hand,--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:3:4:13">1:3:4:13</A></FONT></span>13. He seizes the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; with his right, fearing 'lest the evil spirits, the Rakshas, should enter there in the meantime;' for the officiating priest (br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a) is the repeller of the Rakshas: therefore, while it (the prastara) is still being held down with his left hand,--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:3:4:14">1:3:4:14</A></FONT></span>14. He seizes the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 6), 'Fond of butter art thou, <I>G</I>uh&ucirc; by name!' for fond of butter indeed it is, and <I>G</I>uh&ucirc; by name;--'Sit down here with the favourite resort&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (or dainty) on the favourite seat!' The upabh<I>ri</I>t (he takes), with the formula (ib.), 'Fond of butter art thou, Upabh<I>ri</I>t</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_94"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 94</FONT></A></p>  
<p>by name!' for fond of butter indeed it is, and Upabh<I>ri</I>t by name;--'Sit down here with the favourite resort on the favourite seat!' The dhruv&acirc; (he takes) with 'Fond of butter art thou, Dhruv&acirc; by name!' for fond of butter indeed it is, and Dhruv&acirc; by name;--'Sit down here with the favourite resort on the favourite seat!' What other sacrificial food there is, (he puts down on the prastara), with the formula, 'With the favourite resort sit down on the favourite seat!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:3:4:15">1:3:4:15</A></FONT></span>15. He lays the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; down on (the prastara), and the other spoons down below, (viz. on the barhis, north of the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;, and so as not to touch it or one another); for the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; assuredly is the kshatra, and the other spoons (sru<I>k</I>) are the vi<I>s</I>: he thereby makes the kshatra superior to the vi<I>s</I>. Hence the people here serve, from a lower position, the Kshatriya seated above them: for this reason he places the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; upon (the prastara) and the other spoons down below it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:3:4:16">1:3:4:16</A></FONT></span>16. He touches the offerings, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 6), 'Safely they have sat down,' for safely indeed they sat down;--'in the lap (yoni) of divine truth!' for the sacrifice is indeed the lap of divine truth, and in the sacrifice they sat down;--'Protect these, O Vish<I>n</I>u! protect the sacrifice! protect the lord of sacrifice!' thereby he refers to the sacrificer;--'Protect me, the leader of the sacrifice!' thereby he does not exclude himself either from the sacrifice. Vish<I>n</I>u, assuredly, is the sacrifice: hence it is to the sacrifice that he makes all that over for protection. This is the reason why he says, 'Protect these, O Vish<I>n</I>u!'</p>
