### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:1">1:4:2:1</span></span>1. Now in
former times the gods appointed Agni to the chief (office), namely, that
of Hot*ri*; and having appointed him to the chief (office) saying 'do
thou carry this our oblation!' they cheered him up, saying, 'Surely,
thou art vigorous; surely, thou art equal to this!' thereby endowing him
with vigour, even as in our own days, when they appoint any one from
among their kinsmen to the chief (office), they cheer him up saying
'surely, thou art vigorous; surely, thou art equal to this!' thereby
endowing him with vigour. By what, therefore, he recites after this, he
eulogizes him, puts vigour into him <span
id="fr_303"></span>[2](#fn_302).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:2">1:4:2:2</span></span>2. 'O
Agni, thou art great! O priest (brâhma*n*a), O Bhârata!' for Agni,
indeed, is the brahman

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (sacerdotium):
therefore he says 'O Brâhma*n*a!--O Bhârata' he says, because he (Agni)
bears (bhar) the oblation to the gods: therefore they say 'Agni is
bhârata (the bearer).' Or, he, being the breath, sustains (bhar) these
creatures: therefore he says 'O Bhârata (sustainer)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:3">1:4:2:3</span></span>3. He now
calls on (Agni as) the ancestral (Hot*ri* priest) <span
id="fr_304"></span>[1](#fn_303). He thereby introduces him both to the
*Ri*shis and to the gods (as if he were to say), 'Of great vigour is he
who has obtained the sacrifice!' This is the reason why he calls on
(Agni as) the ancestral (Hot*ri*).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:4">1:4:2:4</span></span>4. He
calls from the remote end (of the sacrificer's

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

ancestral line) downwards; for it is from the remote end downwards that
a race is propagated. He (the Hot*ri*) also thereby propitiates the lord
of seniority for him (the Sacrificer); for here among men the father
comes first, then the son, and then the grandson: this is the reason why
he calls from the remote end downwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:5">1:4:2:5</span></span>5. Having
named (him as) the ancestral one, he says, '(thou wert) kindled by the
gods, kindled by Manu;' for in olden times the gods did kindle him: for
this reason he says 'kindled by the gods;' and 'kindled by Manu' he
says, because in olden times Manu did kindle him: for this reason he
says 'kindled by Manu.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:6">1:4:2:6</span></span>6. He
continues, 'Praised by the *Ri*shis (wert thou);' for in olden times the
*Ri*shis did praise him: for this reason he says 'praised by the
*Ri*shis.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:7">1:4:2:7</span></span>7.
Further, 'Gladdened by bards (vipra);' for those bards, the *Ri*shis,
indeed gladdened him: for this reason he says 'gladdened by bards.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:8">1:4:2:8</span></span>8.
Further, 'Celebrated by sages (kavi);' for those sages, the *Ri*shis,
indeed celebrated him: this is why he says 'celebrated by sages.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:9">1:4:2:9</span></span>9.
Further, 'Sharpened by the brahman (the Veda or vedic formulas),' for he
is indeed sharpened by the brahman;--'the receiver of butter-offerings,'
for he is indeed the receiver of butter-offerings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:10">1:4:2:10</span></span>10.
Further, 'The leader of oblations (ya*gñ*a), the carrier of
(Soma-)sacrifices (adhvara),' for through him they lead forward all
oblations, both the domestic oblations and the others: this is why he
says 'the leader of oblations.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:11">1:4:2:11</span></span>11.
'The carrier (rathî) of sacrifices;' for being a cart (as it were) he
conveys the sacrifice to the

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

gods: this is the reason why he says 'the carrier of sacrifices.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:12">1:4:2:12</span></span>12.
Further, 'The unsurpassed Hot*ri*, the surpassing bearer of oblations;'
for him the Rakshas do not surpass (tar): for this reason he says 'the
unsurpassed (atûrta) Hot*ri*.' 'The surpassing (tûr*n*i, rather 'swift')
bearer of oblations,' for he overcomes (tar) every evil: therefore he
says 'the surpassing bearer of oblations <span
id="fr_305"></span>[1](#fn_304).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:13">1:4:2:13</span></span>13.
Further, 'The mouth-vessel <span id="fr_306"></span>[2](#fn_305), the
offering-spoon of the gods;' for he, Agni, is indeed the vessel of the
gods: therefore they make offerings in Agni to all the gods, he being
the vessel of the gods. And, verily, whosoever knows this, obtains the
vessel of him whose vessel he desires to obtain <span
id="fr_307"></span>[3](#fn_306).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:14">1:4:2:14</span></span>14.
Further, 'The cup from which the gods drink;' for from him, being (as it
were) a cup, the gods drink (the Soma-libations): for this reason he
says 'the cup from which the gods drink.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:15">1:4:2:15</span></span>15.
Further, 'Thou, O Agni! dost encompass the gods, as the felly the
spokes;' 'in the same way in which the felly on all sides encompasses
the spokes, so dost thou on all sides encompass the gods,' this is what
he thereby says.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:16">1:4:2:16</span></span>16.
'Bring hither the gods for the sacrificer!' this he says in order that
he (Agni) may bring the gods

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

to this sacrifice <span id="fr_308"></span>[1](#fn_307).--'Bring Agni
hither, O Agni!' this he says in order that he may bring Agni to the
butter-portion intended for Agni.--'Bring Soma hither!' this he says in
order that he may bring Soma to the butter-portion intended for Soma.
'Bring Agni hither!' this he says in order that he (Agni) may bring Agni
hither to that indispensable <span id="fr_309"></span>[2](#fn_308) cake
which is offered to Agni on both occasions (at the new- and the
full-moon sacrifices).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:17">1:4:2:17</span></span>17. And
(in the same way) according to the respective deities <span
id="fr_310"></span>[3](#fn_309). He then continues, 'Bring hither the
butter-drinking gods!' this he says in order that he may bring hither
the prayâgas and anuyâgas (fore and after-offerings), for the prayâgas
and anuyâgas (represent) indeed the butter-drinking gods.--'Bring Agni
hither for the Hot*ri*ship!' this he says in order that he may bring
Agni hither for the office of Hot*ri*.[](errata.htm#5)--'Your own
greatness bring hither!' this he says in order that he (Agni) may

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

bring hither his own greatness; his own greatness, in truth, is his
voice: hence he says it in order that he may bring hither his
voice <span id="fr_311"></span>[1](#fn_310).--'Bring thou hither (the
gods), O *G*âtavedas <span id="fr_312"></span>[2](#fn_311), and offer up
a good offering!' what deities he bids him bring hither, with regard to
those (deities) he thereby says 'bring them hither!' When he says,
'offer up a good offering!' he means to say, 'sacrifice in the proper
order!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:18">1:4:2:18</span></span>18. He
recites (the invitatory prayer) <span id="fr_313"></span>[3](#fn_312)
while standing, since it is yonder (sky) which he thereby recites; for,
indeed, the invitatory prayer (signifies) yonder (sky), and by it he
recites that which is yonder (sky). This is the reason why he recites
standing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:2:19">1:4:2:19</span></span>19. The
offering-prayer <span id="fr_314"></span>[3](#fn_312) he pronounces
while sitting, since the offering-prayer (represents) this (earth):
hence no one pronounces the offering-prayer while standing; for the
offering-prayer is

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

this earth, and by it he pronounces that which is this (earth). This is
the reason why he pronounces the offering-prayer while sitting.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_302"></span>[114:2](sbe1218.htm#fr_303) The invocations he
now proceeds to recite, on the termination of the sâmidhenîs or kindling
verses, belong to the class of formulas called nigada. In the present
case, they consist of the pravara mantra--or formula by which Agni is
invited to assist the sacrificer as Hot*ri* or Invoker on the present
occasion, as he has of old assisted his ancestors (cf. the following
note)--and of short detached formulas called nivid. Sâya*n*a on Taitt.
S. II, 5, 8.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[115:1](sbe1218.htm#fr_304) Ârsheyam
prav*ri*nîte, literally 'he chooses the ancestral' (*ri*shi). I take
'ârsheyam' as a masculine adjective qualifying a supplied '(Agni*m*)
hotâram.' In this way the formula is explained by Sâya*n*a on I, 5, 1, 9
(*ri*shî*n*â*m* sambandhinam adhvaryur hotâra*m* v*rin*îte), and this
seems to me the most natural interpretation. It is true, however, that,
as the formula ('he chooses the ancestral') became stereotyped, its
exact import became forgotten, and ârsheya was generally taken as a
neuter, either adjective (viz. 'nâmadheyam,' 'apatyam') or noun
(ancestral lineage). Agni is invoked as the one who has of old
officiated as the Hot*ri* of the sacrificer's ancestors, three or five
ancestral names being usually mentioned: thus, in the case of a
sacrificer belonging to the *G*âmadagna Vatsa family, claiming Bh*ri*gu,
*K*yavana, Apnavâna, Aurva, and *G*amadagni as its founders, Agni is
invoked, on the present occasion, as 'Bhargava *K*yavana Âpnavâna Aurva
*G*âmadagna!' (Â*s*val. Sr. 12, 10, 6; Sâya*n*a on Taitt. S. II, 5, 8).
If the sacrificer belongs to the Kshatriya or Vai*s*ya castes, the
priest substitutes for the sacrificer's ancestors those of his family
priest (purohita) or his spiritual guide (guru); and in the case of
kings the same course was adopted, or the names of their royal *ri*shi
ancestors (râ*g*arshi) were chosen. As to the second pravara, or the
election of the human Hot*ri*, for the present sacrifice, see I, 5, 1,
1. Cf. Max Müller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 386 seq.;
A. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 325 seq.; X, 78 seq.; M. Haug, Aitar. Br.,
Translation, p. 479.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[117:1](sbe1218.htm#fr_305) At this point of
the recitation a pause is made, during which (as already partly during
the preceding recitation) the Adhvaryu and Âgnîdhra engage in the acts
detailed in I, 4, 4, 13 seq. Cf. Hillebrandt, Neu and Vollm. p. 81.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[117:2](sbe1218.htm#fr_306) Âs-pâtram: the fire
is, as it were, the vessel into which the sacrificial food is thrown and
from which it is eaten by the gods.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[117:3](sbe1218.htm#fr_307) ? Sâya*n*a supplies
'food:' he obtains the vessel of that food of which he wishes to obtain
the vessel.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[118:1](sbe1218.htm#fr_308) Here begins what is
called the devatânâm âvahanam, or invitation (lit, bringing) of the
deities to the oblations. Whilst the Hot*ri* recites these formulas, the
Adhvaryu performs what is set forth in I, 4, 5, 2 seq.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[118:2](sbe1218.htm#fr_309) A*k*yuta, lit. 'not
fallen,' i.e. immutable, invariable. For the legendary explanation of
this epithet of Agni and his oblation, see I, 6, 1, 6; 2, 5-6.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[118:3](sbe1218.htm#fr_310) The three preceding
invocations are used alike at the new- and full-moon sacrifices, but the
subsequent ones differ according to the oblations that are made, viz. a
rice-cake to Indra-Agni (or an oblation of mixed milk and butter to
Indra) at the new-moon ceremony; and to Agni-Soma at the full-moon
sacrifice. Previously to these an upâ*ms*uyâ*g*a or 'low-voiced
oblation' is made by some to Agni-Soma at the full moon, and one to
Vish*n*u (or to Agni-Soma) at the new-moon sacrifice; according to
others also one to Pra*g*âpati,--the names of the gods being whispered
in the respective formulas.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[119:1](sbe1218.htm#fr_311) Sâya*n*a on Taitt.
S. II, 5, 9 explains the formula 'Bring hither the own greatness' by
'bring hither whatever greatness or power is peculiar to each of the
havis-eating gods,' and he remarks expressly that it is not to be
referred to Agni, as our author certainly appears to do. Cf. I, 7, 3,
13.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[119:2](sbe1218.htm#fr_312) *G*atavedas
probably means 'he who knoweth (all) beings,' but it is more generally
explained by 'he who possesseth riches (or wisdom),' not to mention
other interpretations. According to Haug, Ait. Br. vol. ii. p. 224, the
proper meaning of the term is 'having possession of all that is born,
i.e. pervading it.' He further mentions that the *Ri*shis are quite
familiar with the idea of the fire being an all-pervading power; and
that by Gâtavedas the 'animal fire' is particularly to be understood.
Our present formula 'â *k*a vaha *g*âtaveda*h* suya*g*â *k*a ya*g*a'
somewhat differs from the corresponding formula of the Taitt. S. II, 5,
9, 5, 'â *k*âgne devân vaha suya*g*â *k*a ya*g*a *g*âtaveda*h*.'

<span id="fn_312"></span>[119:3](sbe1218.htm#fr_314) For the anuvâkyâ or
invitatory prayer, and the yâ*g*yâ or Offering-prayer, see [p.
135](sbe1222.htm#page_135) note.
