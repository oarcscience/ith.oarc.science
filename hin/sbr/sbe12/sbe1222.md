### FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:1">1:5:1:1</span></span>1. He
(the Adhvaryu) now utters his call for the Pravara (choosing of the
Hot*ri*) <span id="fr_331"></span>[2](#fn_329). The reason why he utters
his call, is that the (Adhvaryu's) call is

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

the sacrifice: 'having bespoke the sacrifice, I will choose the
Hot*ri*,' thus (he thinks, and) for this reason he utters his call for
the Pravara.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:2">1:5:1:2</span></span>2. He
utters his call after taking the fuel-band; for if the Adhvaryu were to
utter his call without taking hold of the sacrifice, he would either be
unsteady or meet with some other ailment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:3">1:5:1:3</span></span>3. Here
now some utter the call after taking sacrificial grass (barhis) from the
covered altar, or they utter the call after cutting off and taking a
chip of fire-wood, arguing, 'this, surely, is something belonging to the
sacrifice; after taking hold of this, the sacrifice, we will utter the
call.' Let him, however, not do this; for that also wherewith the
firewood was tied together and wherewith they sweep the fire <span
id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_330) is, doubtless, something belonging to
the sacrifice; and thus indeed he utters his call after taking hold of
the sacrifice: for this reason let him utter the call after taking the
fuel-band.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:4">1:5:1:4</span></span>4. Having
uttered the call, he in the first place chooses him who is the Hot*ri*
of the gods, that is, Agni. Thereby he propitiates both Agni and the
gods: for by first choosing Agni, he propitiates Agni;

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

and by first choosing him who is the Hot*ri* of the gods, he propitiates
the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:5">1:5:1:5</span></span>5. He
says, 'Agni, the god, the divine Hot*ri*--,' for Agni is indeed the
Hot*ri* of the gods, therefore he says 'Agni, the god, the divine
Hot*ri*:' thereby he propitiates both Agni and the gods; for by his
first mentioning Agni he propitiates Agni; and by his first mentioning
him who is the Hot*ri* of the gods, he propitiates the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:6">1:5:1:6</span></span>6. 'May
he worship, knowing the gods <span id="fr_333"></span>[1](#fn_331), he
the thoughtful one,'--for he, Agni, indeed, knows the gods well: hence,
he thereby says 'may he who knows them well worship (them) in due form!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:7">1:5:1:7</span></span>7. 'Like
as Manu (did), like as Bharata;'--Manu, indeed, worshipped with
sacrifice in olden times, and doing as he did these descendants of his
now sacrifice: therefore he says 'like as Manu.' Or, say they, (it
means) 'at the sacrifice of Manu,' and therefore he says 'as (he did)
with Manu.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:8">1:5:1:8</span></span>8. 'Like
as (with) Bharata,'--for, say they, he bears (bhar) the oblation to the
gods, hence Bharata (the bearer) is Agni; or, say they, he, having
become the breath, supports (bhar) these creatures, and therefore he
says 'like as Bharata.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:9">1:5:1:9</span></span>9. He
then chooses (Agni as) the ancestral (Hot*ri*). He thus introduces him
both to the (ancestral) *ri*shis and to the gods (as if he were saying),
'he is of mighty strength who obtained the sacrifice!' for this reason
he chooses (him as) the ancestral one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:10">1:5:1:10</span></span>10. He
chooses from the remote end (of the sacrificer's ancestral line) <span
id="fr_334"></span>[2](#fn_332) downwards; for it is from the

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

remote end downwards that a race is propagated. Thereby he also
propitiates the lord of seniority; for here among men the father comes
first, then the son, and then the grandson: this is the reason why he
chooses from the remote end downwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:11">1:5:1:11</span></span>11.
Having named the ancestral, he says, 'Like as, Brahman;'--for Agni is
the Brahman (the Veda, or the sacerdotium), and therefore he says 'like
as Brahman;'--'may he bring (the gods) hither!' what deities he bids him
bring hither, those he refers to in saying 'may he bring (them) hither.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:12">1:5:1:12</span></span>12.
'The Brâhma*n*as (priests) are the guardians of this sacrifice;' for
guardians of the sacrifice, indeed, are those Brâhma*n*as who are versed
in the sacred writ, because they spread it, they originate it: these he
thereby propitiates; and for this reason he says, 'the Brâhma*n*as are
the guardians of the sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:13">1:5:1:13</span></span>13.
'N.N. is the man,' thereby he chooses this man for his Hot*ri*;
heretofore he was not a Hot*ri*, but now he is a Hot*ri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:14">1:5:1:14</span></span>14. The
chosen Hot*ri* mutters,--has recourse to the deities: in order that he
may give the vasha*t*-call to the gods in its proper order, that he may
convey the oblation to the gods in its proper order, that he may not
stumble, he has thus recourse to the deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:15">1:5:1:15</span></span>15. He
mutters on this occasion <span id="fr_335"></span>[1](#fn_333), 'Thee, O
divine Savit*ri*, they now choose,'--thereby he has recourse to
Savit*ri* for his impulsion (prasava), for Savit*ri* is the impeller
(prasavit*ri*) of the gods;--'(thee who art) Agni, for the Hot*ri*ship,'
thereby he

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

propitiates both Agni and the gods; for by first naming Agni, he
propitiates Agni; and by first naming him who is the Hot*ri* of the
gods, he propitiates the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:16">1:5:1:16</span></span>16.
'Together with father Vai*s*vânara,'--for the father Vai*s*vânara
('common to all men'), doubtless, is the year, is Pra*g*âpati (lord of
creatures); hence he thereby propitiates the year and thus
Pra*g*âpati.--'O Agni! O Pûshan! O B*ri*haspati! speak forth and offer
up sacrifice (pra-ya*g*)!'--he (the Hot*ri*), namely, will have to
recite the anuvâkyâs and the yâgyâs <span
id="fr_336"></span>[1](#fn_334); he therefore now propitiates those
gods: do ye recite, 'do ye offer!' thus (he thereby says).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:17">1:5:1:17</span></span>17.
'May we partake of the bounty of the Vasus, of the wide sway of the
Rudras! may we be beloved of the Âdityas for the sake of (aditi)
security from injury, free from obstruction!'--these, to wit, the Vasus,
Rudras, and Âdityas, namely, are three (classes of) gods: 'may we enjoy
their protection' he thereby says.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:18">1:5:1:18</span></span>18.
'May I this day utter speech that is agreeable to the gods;'--by this he
means to say 'may I this day recite what is agreeable to the gods,' for
auspicious it is when one recites what is agreeable to the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:19">1:5:1:19</span></span>19.
'Agreeable to the Brahmans,'--by this he means to say 'may I this day
recite what is agreeable to the Brâhma*n*as (priests);' for auspicious
it is when one recites what is agreeable to the Brâhma*n*as.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:20">1:5:1:20</span></span>20.
'Agreeable to Narâ*s*a*m*sa <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_335),'--man
(nara), namely, is a creature: hence he says this for all the creatures;
thereby it is auspicious, and whether or not he knows (forms of speech
that are agreeable), they are uttered (and received with applause),
'well he has recited! well he has recited!'--'What at the Hot*ri* choice
may escape the crooked eye this day, that may Agni bring back here, he,
the knower of beings (*g*âtavedas), the nimble one
(vi*k*arsha*n*i)!'--by this he means to say, 'even as those (three)
Agnis, whom they first chose for the Hot*ri*ship, passed away <span
id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_336), (but thou, the fourth Agni, wast then
obtained,) so do thou make good for me whatever mistake may have been
committed at my election!' and it is accordingly made good for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:21">1:5:1:21</span></span>21. He
now touches the Adhvaryu and the Âgnîdhra: for the Adhvaryu is the mind,
and the Hot*ri* is, speech: thus he thereby brings mind and speech
together.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:22">1:5:1:22</span></span>22. At
the same time he mutters <span id="fr_339"></span>[3](#fn_337), 'From
anguish may the six spaces protect me, fire, earth, water, wind, day,
and night <span id="fr_340"></span>[4](#fn_338)!'--'may these deities
protect

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

me from disease!' thus he thereby says; for he whom these deities
protect from disease, will not stumble (or fail).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:23">1:5:1:23</span></span>23. He
steps beside the Hot*ri*'s seat, takes one stalk of (reed) grass from
the Hot*ri*'s seat and casts it outside (the sacrificial ground), with
the formula, 'Ejected is the wealth-clutcher (parâvasu, lit.
"off-wealth")!' Formerly, namely, the Hot*ri* of the Asuras was one
Parâvasu by name: him he thereby ejects from the Hot*ri*'s seat.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:24">1:5:1:24</span></span>24. He
then sits down on the Hot*ri*'s seat, with the formula, 'I here sit down
on the seat of the wealth-bestower (arvâvasu, lit. "hither-wealth")!'
for one Arvâvasu by name was the Hot*ri* of the gods <span
id="fr_341"></span>[1](#fn_339), and on his seat he accordingly sits
down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:25">1:5:1:25</span></span>25. At
the same time he mutters, 'O All-maker, thou art the protector of lives!
do not ye two (fires) scorch me away (from this) <span
id="fr_342"></span>[2](#fn_340), injure me not! this

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

is your sphere;' with this he moves slightly northwards: by this
(mantra, he indicates that) he sits midway between the Âhavanîya and the
Gârhapatya, and thus he propitiates these two; and in accordance with
what he says, 'do not scorch me away from this! injure me not!' they do
not injure him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:1:26">1:5:1:26</span></span>26. He
then mutters whilst looking at the (Âhavanîya) fire, 'All ye gods,
instruct me, how and what I am to mind while seated here as the chosen
Hot*ri*! declare my share (of the sacrificial duties), how and by what
road I am to convey the oblation to you!'--for as one says to those for
whom food has been cooked, 'order me how I am to bring if you, how I am
to serve it up for you!' in like manner he is desirous of directions
regarding the gods, and for this reason he mutters thus, 'instruct me
how I may utter the Vasha*t*-call for you in its proper order, how I may
bring you the oblation in its proper order!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_329"></span>[131:2](sbe1222.htm#fr_331) The Hot*ri*, on
concluding the invitation of the gods, sits down with raised knees in
the same place where he has been standing (see [p.
95](sbe1216.htm#page_95), note [1](sbe1216.htm#fn_263)), parts the
sacrificial grass of the altar, and measures a span on the earth, with
the text (Â*s*v. I, 3, 22), 'Aditi is his mother, do not cut him off
from the air. With the aid of <span id="page_132">p. 132</span> Agni,
the god, the deity; with the threefold chant, with the râthantara-sâman,
with the gâyatrî metre, with the agnish*t*oma sacrifice, with the
vasha*t*-call, the thunderbolt,--I here kill him who hates us, and whom
we hate!' The Adhvaryu having thereupon walked round the Hot*ri* from
left to right, steps behind the utkara (heap of rubbish) with his face
to the east and the fuel-band in his hand, and calls on (â*s*râvayati)
the Âgnîdhra, with Õ *s*râvaya (or Õ*m* *s*râvaya, i.e. â *s*râvaya; or
simply '*s*râvaya;' cf. Sâya*n*a on Taitt. S. I, 6, 11). The Âgnîdhra
(whilst standing north of the Adhvaryu, with his face to the south, and
taking the wooden sword and the fuel-band from the Adhvaryu) responds
(pratyâ*s*râvayati) by 'astu *s*rausha*t*.'

<span id="fn_330"></span>[132:1](sbe1222.htm#fr_332) See [p.
127](sbe1220.htm#page_127), note [1](sbe1221.htm#fn_321).

<span id="fn_331"></span>[133:1](sbe1222.htm#fr_333) Thus our author. It
should rather be 'May (he) worship the gods, he the wise, the
considerate one.'

<span id="fn_332"></span>[133:2](sbe1222.htm#fr_334) Cf. [p.
115](sbe1218.htm#page_115), note [1](sbe1218.htm#fn_303).

<span id="fn_333"></span>[134:1](sbe1222.htm#fr_335) Except the
beginning, these formulas are entirely different from those given by
Â*s*v. *S*. I, 3, 23-24.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[135:1](sbe1222.htm#fr_336) The yâ*g*yâs
(offering-prayers) are the prayers which the Hot*ri* pronounces when the
offerings are poured into the fire (this being done simultaneously with,
or immediately after, the van shat, 'may he carry it,' with which the
yâ*g*yâ ends, is pronounced). At the chief oblations the offering-prayer
is preceded by an anuvâkyâ or puro ’nuvâkyâ (invitatory prayer) by which
the gods are invited to come to the offering, and which ends with 'om.'

<span id="fn_335"></span>[136:1](sbe1222.htm#fr_337) Narâ*s*a*m*sa
\['the hope or desire (â*s*a*m*sâ) of man (nara)'\] is a mystical form
of Agni, invoked chiefly in the Âprî-hymns at animal sacrifices. 'Yathâ
sarve ’pi narâ â sarvata*h* samsanti tathâvidhâya.' Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[136:2](sbe1222.htm#fr_338) See the legend I,
2, 3, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[136:3](sbe1222.htm#fr_339) This and the
succeeding formulas also are entirely different from those given in
Â*s*v. *S*. I, 3, 27 seq. The Sâṅkhây. *S*. I, 6 (Hillebrandt, Neu and
Vollm. p. 91) seems to coincide, to some extent, with those given by our
author.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[136:4](sbe1222.htm#fr_340) The six spaces or
wide expanses (urvî) are several times referred to in Vedic texts, but
the conception seems to have been very vague. They are generally
supposed to include the space above, the space below, and the four
quarters. In Rig-veda VI, 47, 3-5 it is stated that they have been
measured out <span id="page_137">p. 137</span> by Indra, and that
outside of them there is no being (bhuvanam); and they are then
enumerated thus: the expanse of the earth, the height (varshman,?
highest point or sphere) of the sky (div), the sap (pîyûsha) in the
three elevations \[? i.e. flowing, animating moisture, as rain, rivers,
sap, &c.\], the atmosphere, the ocean (? ar*n*as,? of light, air), and
the sky (div). The enumeration of six objects in Atharva-veda II, 12, 1
seems to refer to the same conception: heaven and earth
(dyâvâp*ri*thivî), the wide atmospheric region, the genius (fem.) of the
field (kshetrasya patnî), the far-strider (Sun, Light), the wide
atmospheric region (uru-antariksham as before; cf. the double
enumeration of div in the *Ri*k passage); and what has the Wind for its
guardian (vâtagopa). Cf. Weber, Ind: Stud. XIII, p. 164. Sâ*n*kb.
G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 6, 4 gives heaven and earth, day and night, water and
plants (St. Petersburg Dictionary s.v.).

<span id="fn_339"></span>[137:1](sbe1222.htm#fr_341) According to the
Kaushît. Br. VI, 10, Arvâvasu was the Brahman of the gods. Weber, Ind.
Stud. II, 306.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[137:2](sbe1222.htm#fr_342) The Hot*ri*'s seat
stands north of the north-west corner of the altar, the Âhavanîya and
the Gârhapatya fires being about equidistant from it towards south-east
and south-west respectively.
