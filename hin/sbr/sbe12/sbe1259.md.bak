### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:4:1">2:5:4:1</span></span>1.
Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew V*ri*tra <span
id="fr_933"></span>[3](#fn_929.md); by means of it they gained that supreme
authority which they now wield; and so does he (the Sacrificer) thereby
now slay his wicked, spiteful enemy, and gain the victory: this is why
he performs this sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:4:2">2:5:4:2</span></span>2. The
mode of its performance (is as follows): They raise an uttara-vedi <span
id="fr_934"></span>[4](#fn_930.md); they use clotted butter <span
id="fr_935"></span>[5](#fn_931.md); and they churn the fire. There are nine

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

fore-offerings and nine after-offerings <span
id="fr_936"></span>[1](#fn_932.md), and three Samish*t*aya*g*us. In the
first place there are those five oblations <span
id="fr_937"></span>[2](#fn_933.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:4:3">2:5:4:3</span></span>3. Now as
to why there is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni. With Agni, (shaped
into) a sharp point (te*g*as) <span id="fr_938"></span>[3](#fn_934.md),
indeed, they (the gods) slew him (V*ri*tra); and Agni, that sharp point,
swerved not: hence there is (a cake) for Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:4:4">2:5:4:4</span></span>4. Then
as to why there is a rice-pap for Soma. With the aid of Soma, the king,
indeed they slew him, they who have Soma for their king: hence there is
a pap for Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:4:5">2:5:4:5</span></span>5. Then
as to why there is a cake on twelve, or eight <span
id="fr_939"></span>[4](#fn_935.md), potsherds for Savit*ri*. Savit*ri*,
indeed, is the impeller (prasavit*ri*) of the gods; and impelled by
Savit*ri* they slew him: hence there is (a cake) for Savit*ri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:4:6">2:5:4:6</span></span>6. Then
as to why there is a rice-pap for Sarasvatî. Sarasvatî in truth is
Speech; and Speech indeed it was that cheered them up, saying, 'Strike!
slay <span id="fr_940"></span>[5](#fn_936.md)!' Hence there is a pap for
Sarasvatî.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:4:7">2:5:4:7</span></span>7. Then
as to why there is a rice-pap for Pûshan. Pûshan doubtless is this
earth <span id="fr_941"></span>[6](#fn_937.md), and this

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>

earth, indeed, gave him (V*ri*tra) up to slaughter; and they slew him,
thus given up by her: hence there is a rice-pap for Pûshan.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:4:8">2:5:4:8</span></span>8. Then
follows a cake on twelve, potsherds for Indra and Agni; for by means of
that they slew him, since Agni means fiery glow (te*g*as), and Indra
means manly power, and by means of these two powers they did indeed slay
him. Moreover, Agni is the priesthood, and Indra is the nobility; having
allied these two, having closely united the priesthood with the
nobility, they (the gods) slew him by means of these two powers: hence
there is a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:4:9">2:5:4:9</span></span>9. Then
follows a rice-part for Mahendra. For before the slaying of V*ri*tra he
was indeed Indra; but after slaying V*ri*tra he became Mahendra (the
great Indra), even as (a king becomes) a mahârâ*g*a, after obtaining the
victory: hence there is a rice-pap for Mahendra. And thereby indeed he
renders him great (strong), for the slaying of V*ri*tra: for this reason
also there is a rice-pap for Mahendra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:4:10">2:5:4:10</span></span>10.
Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Vi*s*vakarman. To the gods,
indeed, on performing the Sâkamedha-sacrifice and obtaining the victory
(over V*ri*tra), that sacred work (karman) was made complete (vi*s*va),
and all was conquered; and so is that sacred work made complete, and all
is conquered, by him who has performed the Sâkamedha-sacrifice and
obtained the victory: hence there is a cake on one potsherd for
Vi*s*vakarman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:5:4:11">2:5:4:11</span></span>11.
And, verily, by performing this sacrifice the gods became what race,
what prosperity of the gods there now is; and that same race he
propagates,

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

that same prosperity he attains, whosoever, knowing this, performs this
sacrifice. Let him therefore perform this sacrifice.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[417:3](sbe1259.htm#fr_933.md) See [p.
416](sbe1258.htm#page_416), note [1](sbe1258.htm#fn_925.md).

<span id="fn_930"></span>[417:4](sbe1259.htm#fr_934.md) See [p.
392](sbe1257.htm#page_392), note [1](sbe1257.htm#fn_879.md). The southern
altar is not required at the present ceremony.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[417:5](sbe1259.htm#fr_935.md) See [p.
404](sbe1257.htm#page_404), note [1](sbe1257.htm#fn_896.md).

<span id="fn_932"></span>[418:1](sbe1259.htm#fr_936.md) See II, 5, 2, 30
and 41.

<span id="fn_933"></span>[418:2](sbe1259.htm#fr_937.md) See II, 5, 1, 11,
with note 9.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[418:3](sbe1259.htm#fr_938.md) See II, 5, 3, 2.
This cake, again, is to be prepared (or offered) simultaneously with the
rising of the sun; see [p. 409](sbe1258.htm#page_409.md) note.

<span id="fn_935"></span>[418:4](sbe1259.htm#fr_939.md) According to Taitt.
S. I, 8, 4 it is to be one on twelve potsherds.

<span id="fn_936"></span>[418:5](sbe1259.htm#fr_940.md) The Kâ*n*va text
has, 'Attack (abhipadyasva)! strike! slay!'

<span id="fn_937"></span>[418:6](sbe1259.htm#fr_941.md) This identification
of Pûshan with the earth is very strange, the more so as, at II, 5, 1,
11, special stress is laid on the male nature of Pûshan. Perhaps it is
in his character of bountiful bestower of food and cattle, or as the
tutelary god of travellers, that he is so identified.
