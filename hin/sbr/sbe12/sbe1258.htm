Now with these S&acirc;kamedha offerings,--therewith indeed the gods slew V<I>ri</I>tra, therewith they gained that supreme authority which they now wield; and so does he now therewith slay his wicked, spiteful enemy and gain the victory: this is why he performs these offerings in the fourth month (after the Varu<I>n</I>apragh&acirc;s&acirc;<I>h</I>). He performs them on two successive days.</p>

And so does he (the Sacrificer) now rush forward, after shaping Agni into a sharp point, intent on slaying his wicked, spiteful enemy; and that sharp point, Agni, swerves not: this is why he sacrifices to Agni An&icirc;kavat.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:3:3">2:5:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. Thereupon, at midday, he offers a potful of boiled grain (<I>k</I>aru) to the Maruts, the Scorchers (S&acirc;ntapan&acirc;<I>h</I>), for at midday indeed the scorching winds scorched V<I>ri</I>tra; and thus scorched he lay panting and gasping, being rent all over. And so do the scorching winds scorch his (the Sacrificer's) wicked, spiteful enemy: hence (he sacrifices) to the Maruts, the Scorchers.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:3:4">2:5:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. Thereupon, (in the evening, he offers a potful of boiled grain) to the Maruts, the Householders (G<I>ri</I>hamedhina<I>h</I>). That pap he cooks after driving</p>

<p>away the calves (from the cows) with the (pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a-) branch, and having (all the cows) milked into the pot containing the strainers. Now, whenever (in preparing the pap) they use (whole) rice-grains, then that is a <I>k</I>aru: this nourishment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_916"></A><A HREF="#fn_912"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the gods took when they were about to slay V<I>ri</I>tra on the morrow; and so does he (the Sacrificer) now take that nourishment, being about to slay his wicked, spiteful enemy. The reason, then, why it is milk-pap, is that milk is nourishment, and rice-grains are nourishment, and that he thus puts into him (&acirc;tman) that twofold nourishment. For this reason it is a rice-pap (prepared) with milk.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:3:5">2:5:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. The practice, in regard to this (pap, is as follows).

Near this covered altar they lay down the enclosing-sticks and pieces of wood.

Thereupon he takes the two dishes of pap, and walks up (to the altar); and again, he takes the dipping and offering spoons, and walks up; and having touched&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_918"></A><A HREF="#fn_914"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the covered altar, and laid the enclosing-sticks round (the fire)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_919"></A><A HREF="#fn_915"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he puts on as many pieces of firewood as he thinks fit. He then deposits those two dishes of pap, and the dipping and offering spoons, in their places (outside the altar). The Hot<I>ri</I> sits down on the Hot<I>ri</I>'s seat. Taking the dipping and offering spoons, he (the Adhvaryu) says,--</p>

He then takes four 'cuttings' of butter from the hollow of the southern pap, and steps over (to the south side of the fire). Having stepped over, and called for the (&Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra's) '<I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>,' he says (to the Hot<I>ri</I>), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.</p>

He makes an 'under-layer' of butter (in the offering-spoon) from the hollow of the southern pap, takes two cuttings from the latter, pours some butter thereon, and steps across.

<p>it, and removed it (from the fire), he anoints it. He then removes the butter in the pot (from the fire), and wipes the dipping and offering spoons. Thereupon, taking the dish with the pap, he walks up (to the altar); and again, taking the butter in the pot, he walks up; and again, taking the dipping and offering spoons, he walks up (to the altar). He then touches that covered altar, lays the enclosing-sticks round (the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya fire), and puts on as many pieces of wood as he thinks fit. He then deposits successively&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_924"></A><A HREF="#fn_920"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (in their respective places) the dish with the pap, the pot with butter, and the dipping and offering spoons. The Hot<I>ri</I> sits down in the Hot<I>ri</I>'s seat. Taking the dipping and offering spoons, he (the Adhvaryu) says,--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:3:12">2:5:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!' with a view to (offering) Agni's butter-portion. He then takes four 'cuttings' of butter from the pot and steps across (to the offering-place on the south side of the fire). Having stepped across and called for the (&Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra's) <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>, he says (to the Hot<I>ri</I>), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vasha<I>t</I> has been uttered.</p>

<p>across, and called for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-formula to Soma!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:3:14">2:5:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. Thereupon he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the Maruts, the Householders!' He then makes an 'under-layer' of butter (in the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;), takes two cuttings from that pap, pours some butter thereon, re-anoints (replenishes with butter the parts of the sacrificial dish from which he has made)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_925"></A><A HREF="#fn_921"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the two cuttings, and steps across (to the offering-place). Having stepped across and called for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Maruts, the Householders!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:3:15">2:5:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. Thereupon he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t!' He then makes an under-layer of butter, takes one cutting from the pap, pours twice butter thereon, without, however, re-anointing the (place of the) cutting; and steps across. Having stepped across, and called for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:3:16">2:5:3:16</A></FONT></span>16, He then cuts off the I<I>d</I>&acirc;, but no fore-portion. Having invoked (the I<I>d</I>&acirc;), they (the priests) eat it. As many members of (the sacrificer's) household as are entitled to partake of the remains of sacrificial</p>

<p>food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_926"></A><A HREF="#fn_922"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> may eat (of the pap); or the officiating priests may eat it; or, if there be abundant pap, other Br&acirc;hmans also may eat of it. The pot having then been covered, before it is quite emptied, they put it away in a safe place, for the 'full-spoon ceremony.' Thereupon they let the calves together with their mothers; and thus the cattle take that nourishment. That night he performs the Agnihotra with rice-gruel. In the morning they milk a cow, which suckles an adopted calf&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_927"></A><A HREF="#fn_923"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for the purpose of the offering to the fathers.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:3:17">2:5:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. Thereupon, in the morning, either after or before the performance of the Agnihotra--whichever he pleases--he cuts out (the remaining rice-pap) with the darvi-spoon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_928"></A><A HREF="#fn_924"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> from the un-emptied pot, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>.

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> O thou (Indra), of a hundredfold powers, let us two barter food and drink, like wares!' In like manner as an invitatory prayer (is used at offerings) so does he by this (verse) invite him (Indra) to that share.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:3:18">2:5:3:18</A></FONT></span>18. Let him then tell (the Sacrificer) to make a bull roar. 'If it roars,' say some, 'then that (sound) is the Vashat; let him offer after that Vashat.' And in this way indeed he calls Indra in his own form to the slaying of V<I>ri</I>tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_929"></A><A HREF="#fn_925"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for the bull is indeed Indra's form: hence he thereby calls Indra in his own form to the slaying of V<I>ri</I>tra. If it roars, then one may know that Indra has come to his sacrifice, that his sacrifice is with Indra. And should it not roar, let the priest, seated on the south side (viz. the Brahman), say, 'Sacrifice!'--this, indeed, is Indra's voice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:3:19">2:5:3:19</A></FONT></span>19. He offers with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. III, 50), 'Give unto me, (and) I give unto thee.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:3:20">2:5:3:20</A></FONT></span>20. He then offers a cake on seven potsherds to the sportive (Kr&icirc;dina<I>h</I>) Maruts. For when Indra went forward in order to slay V<I>ri</I>tra, the sportive Maruts were sporting around him singing his praises; and even so do they sport around this (Sacrificer), singing his praises, now that he is about to slay his wicked, spiteful enemy: this</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_909"></A><A HREF="sbe1258.htm#fr_913">408:1</A> The performance of the S&acirc;kamedha offerings requires two days. In the first place--after the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya has been 'taken out' from the G&acirc;rhapatya--both fires are taken up by means of (or 'made to mount') the two kindling-sticks, and transferred (by 'churning out') to another altar (the uttaravedi). On the first day oblations are then made to Agni An&icirc;kavat, the Maruta<I>h</I> S&acirc;ntapan&acirc;<I>h</I> and the Maruto G<I>ri</I>hamedhina<I>h</I>, these being completed on the next morning by a Darvihoma to Indra, and an oblation of cake to the Maruta<I>h</I> Kr&icirc;<I>d</I>ina<I>h</I>. Then follows the Mah&acirc;havis, consisting--besides the five constant oblations--of oblations to Indra-Agni, Mahendra, and Vi<I>s</I>vakarman. In the afternoon takes place the Mah&acirc;pit<I>ri</I>ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a, or (Great) sacrifice to the Manes (performed on a special altar and fire-place, south of the Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;gi); which is succeeded by the Traiyambakahoma, or offering to Rudra Tryambaka, performed on a cross-way somewhere north of the sacrificial ground.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_910"></A><A HREF="sbe1258.htm#fr_914">408:2</A> That is, Agni, the 'sharp-pointed' or 'sharp-edged;' an epithet apparently referring to the pointed flames or tongues of. Agni. The St. Petersburg Dict. takes it to mean 'Agni, possessed of a face.' Perhaps it may mean, 'Agni, constituting the front or van of the army.' In <I>S</I>at. Br. III, 4, 4, 14, Agni is likened to the point (an&icirc;ka) of the thunderbolt, Soma to its shaft (<I>s</I>akya), and Vish<I>n</I>u <A NAME="page_409"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 409</FONT></A> to the part where the point is fixed on the shaft (kulmala). Compare the corresponding passage in Taitt. Br. I, 6, 6: 'The gods and Asuras were contending. Agni spake, "My body is an&icirc;kavat (possessed of an army, acc. to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a): satisfy it and you will overcome the Asuras!" The gods prepared a cake on eight potsherds for Agni An&icirc;kavat. Agni An&icirc;kavat, being pleased with his share, produced for himself four an&icirc;kas; and thereby the gods prevailed and the Asuras were defeated. . . . Now Agni An&icirc;kavat is yonder sun: his rays are the an&icirc;kas.' Here an&icirc;ka would rather seem to mean either 'dart or 'face.' [In Taitt. Br. I, 6, 2, 5, in the battle between the gods and Asuras, Agni is represented as the mukham of the gods, which S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a takes to mean the 'van-guard' or 'the champion' of the gods. Compare also <I>S</I>at. Br. II, 6, 4, 2; XI, 5, 2, 4]. Acc. to the Black Ya<I>g</I>us, the cake to Agni An&icirc;kavat is to be prepared (or offered) simultaneously (s&acirc;kam) with the rising of the sun; whence is probably derived the term 'S&acirc;kam-edha.'</P>

V, 6, 6 has 'tad eva' instead of 'ned eva.' S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a says that the butter is put on the Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;gni; but according to K&acirc;ty. V, 6, 24, it is put on the fire together with the pap. The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text has, abhyardha &acirc;<I>g</I>ya<I>m</I> <A NAME="page_413"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 413</FONT></A> sth&acirc;ly&acirc;m adhi<I>s</I>rayati, 'he puts on the butter in the pot on the near side.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_920"></A><A HREF="sbe1258.htm#fr_924">413:1</A> In the original this is expressed by repetition of the verb, as was the case in the last sentence but one, where the original construction is retained. The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text has merely, 'Having taken (the pap) with the dish, he hastes up (ud&acirc;dravati).'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_921"></A><A HREF="sbe1258.htm#fr_925">414:1</A> 'Pratyanakti' is probably the same as 'pratyabhigh&acirc;rayati,' generally applied to the basting of the avad&acirc;na-sth&acirc;na, or that part of the havis from whence the cuttings have been made (K&acirc;ty. I, 9, II; the 'replenishing' of the havis in <I>S</I>at. Br. I, 7, 3, 6 refers to the same thing). See, however, K&acirc;ty. V, 6, 22, where it is ruled that no pratyabhigh&acirc;ra<I>n</I>a is to take place at the present sacrifice. The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va MS., on the other hand, reads, 'he does not re-anoint the two cuttings.' Perhaps he is to anoint separately the two cut-off pieces.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_922"></A><A HREF="sbe1258.htm#fr_926">415:1</A> That is, those who have been invested with the sacrificial cord. According to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 7, 1 the mistress of the house is not to eat of it, but an additional (prative<I>s</I>a) pap is to be cooked specially for her on the Dakshi<I>n</I>a fire.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_923"></A><A HREF="sbe1258.htm#fr_927">415:2</A> 'In the morning they tie up the (adopted) calf of a niv&acirc;ny&acirc; (cow suckling a strange calf),' K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_924"></A><A HREF="sbe1258.htm#fr_928">415:3</A> The Darvi-homa, or oblation of a darvi-spoonful of boiled rice to Indra, the associate of the Maruts, may be considered as part of the G<I>ri</I>hamedh&icirc;y&acirc; ish<I>t</I>i, being, as it were, an offering of remains (or scrapings, nishk&acirc;sa, Taitt. Br. I, 6, 7, 3); cf. K&acirc;ty. V, 6, 33. Like all <I>G</I>uhoti-offerings, the darvi-homa is performed by the Adhvaryu while seated on the north side of the fire. According to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 7, 3, it is to be offered in the G&acirc;rhapatya, but according to Katy. V, 6, 38 (comm.) in the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya. If the concluding ceremonies of the S&acirc;ntapan&icirc;y&acirc; ish<I>t</I>i (from the offering of the Barhis) have not already been performed on the previous night, they have to be performed after the conclusion of the darvi-homa. If, however, only the offering of the Barhis was then omitted, the darvi-homa, if performed before the Agnihotra, is followed immediately by that oblation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_925"></A><A HREF="sbe1258.htm#fr_929">416:1</A> On the symbolic connection of the seasonal offerings, especially the S&acirc;kamedh&acirc;<I>h</I>, with the slaying of V<I>ri</I>tra, the evil spirit of drought, see II, 6, 4, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_926"></A><A HREF="sbe1258.htm#fr_930">416:2</A> According to Mah&icirc;dhara, this first line is spoken by Indra to his worshipper; the second line containing the latter's reply.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_927"></A><A HREF="sbe1258.htm#fr_931">417:1</A> Comp. Taitt. Br. I, 6, 7, 4: When Indra had slain V<I>ri</I>tra (with the thunderbolt) he went to the farthest distances, thinking that he had missed (his aim). He said, 'Who will know this' [viz. whether V<I>ri</I>tra is really dead or not, comm.]? The Maruts said, 'We will choose a boon, then we will know (find it out): let the first oblation be prepared for us!<font size="-1" color="green">'</font> They sported (danced about) on him (V<I>ri</I>tra, and thereby found out that he was dead).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_928"></A><A HREF="sbe1258.htm#fr_932">417:2</A> That is to say, the Mah&acirc;-havis, or Great Oblation, though apparently only an integral part of the S&acirc;kamedh&acirc;<I>h</I>, is in reality its chief ceremony, and may therefore be considered as being itself on a par with the other seasonal offerings; hence it requires the five oblations common to all the <I>K</I>&acirc;turm&acirc;syas; see II, 5, 1, 8-11. The Black Ya<I>g</I>us it seems does not use the term Mah&acirc;-havis, but assigns more importance to the Mah&acirc;-pit<I>ri</I>ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a (see II, 6, 1, 1 seq.). See &Acirc;pastamba's Paribh&acirc;sh&acirc;s, 80, 81 (M. M&uuml;ller, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morg. Ges. IX), according to which the sacrifice to the Manes belongs to the Mah&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as.</P>
