### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:4:1">2:6:4:1</span></span>1. Now
when it is said, that the gods, by means of the Sâkamedha -offerings,
slew V*ri*tra and gained that supreme authority which they now
wield,--it is rather by means of all the Seasonal sacrifices that the
gods slew V*ri*tra; it is by all of them that they gained that supreme
authority which they now wield.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:4:2">2:6:4:2</span></span>2. They
spake, 'With what king, with what leader <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[1](#fn_1004.md) shall we fight?' Agni spake, 'With me
for your king, with me for your leader!' With Agni for their king, with
Agni for their leader, they gained four months; and with the Brahman
(sacerdotium) and the threefold science they encompassed them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:4:3">2:6:4:3</span></span>3. They
spake, 'With what king, with what leader shall we fight?' Varu*n*a
spake, 'With me for your king, with me for your leader!' With Varu*n*a
for their king, with Varu*n*a for their leader, they gained other four
months; and with the Brahman and the threefold science they encompassed
them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:4:4">2:6:4:4</span></span>4. They
spake, 'With what king, with what leader shall we fight?' Indra spake,
'With me for your king, with me for your leader!' With Indra for their
king, with Indra for their leader, they gained other four months; and
with the Brahman and the threefold science they encompassed them.

<span id="page_450">p. 450</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:4:5">2:6:4:5</span></span>5. And,
accordingly, when he performs the Vai*s*vadeva, he thereby gains four
months, with Agni for his king, with Agni for his leader. Then (in
shaving) are used a porcupine's quill spotted in three places, and a
copper razor; that three-spotted porcupine's quill resembles the
threefold science, and the copper razor resembles the Brahman; for the
Brahman is fire, and fire is of reddish (lohita) colour: hence a copper
(loha) razor is used. Therewith he has (his head) shaved all round <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[1](#fn_1005); and thus he (the Adhvaryu.md)
encompasses him with the Brahman and the threefold science.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:4:6">2:6:4:6</span></span>6. And
when he performs the Varu*n*apraghâsa offerings, he thereby gains other
four months, with Varu*n*a for his king, with Varu*n*a for his leader.
Then a three-spotted quill of a porcupine and a copper razor are used,
wherewith he has himself shaved all round; and thus he (the priest)
encompasses him with the Brahman and the threefold science.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:4:7">2:6:4:7</span></span>7. And
when he performs the Sâkamedha offerings, he thereby gains other four
months, with Indra for his king, with Indra for his leader. Then a
three-spotted quill of a porcupine and a copper razor are used,
wherewith he has himself shaved; and thus he (the priest) encompasses
him with the Brahman and the threefold science.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:4:8">2:6:4:8</span></span>8. And
when he performs the Vai*s*vadeva, then he becomes Agni, and attains to
union with Agni and to co-existence in his world. And when he performs
the Varu*n*apraghâsa offerings, then he becomes Varu*n*a, and attains to
union with Varu*n*a

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

and to co-existence in his world. And when he performs the Sâkamedha
offerings, then he becomes Indra, and attains to union with Indra and to
coexistence in his world <span id="fr_1010"></span>[1](#fn_1006.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:4:9">2:6:4:9</span></span>9. And in
whatever season he goes to yonder world, that season passes him on to
the next season, and that season again passes him on to the next
season,--he who performs the Seasonal sacrifices reaches the highest
place, the supreme goal. Wherefore it is said, 'They find not him that
offereth the Seasonal offerings, for verily he goeth unto the highest
place, to the supreme goal <span id="fr_1011"></span>[2](#fn_1007.md).'

<span id="fn_1007"></span>[451:2](sbe1263.htm#fr_1011.md) The Kâ*n*va text
has: In whatever season the performer of Seasonal offerings goes to
yonder world, that season passes him on to the next season, and that
next one to the next one,--him the seasons, by transmission, make thus
attain to the highest station, to the highest world. Wherefore is it
said, 'They find not him that offereth the Seasonal offerings, for he
conquereth the highest world, the highest conquest (parama*m* hy eva
