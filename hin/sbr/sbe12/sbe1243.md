### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:1">2:1:4:1</span></span>1. On the
day preceding his Agnyâdheya, he (the sacrificer with his wife) should
take his food in the day-time. For the gods know the minds of man: they
are, therefore, aware that his Agnyâdheya is to take place on the
morrow; and all the gods betake themselves to his house and stay
(upa-vas) in his house; whence this day is called upavasatha
(fast-day) <span id="fr_674"></span>[3](#fn_670.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:2">2:1:4:2</span></span>2. Now,
as it would be unbecoming for him to take food before men (who are
staying with him as his guests) have eaten; how much more would it be
so, if he were to take food before the gods have eaten: let him
therefore take his food in the day-time. However, he may also, if he
choose, take food at night,

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

since the observance of the vow is not necessary for him who has not
performed Agnyâdheya. For so long as he has not set up a (sacrificial)
fire of his own, he is merely a man, and may therefore, if he choose,
take food at night.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:3">2:1:4:3</span></span>3. Here
now some tie up a he-goat <span id="fr_675"></span>[1](#fn_671.md), arguing
that the goat is sacred to Agni and that (this is done) for the
completeness of the fire. But he need not do this. Should he possess a
he-goat, let him present it to the Âgnîdhra on the next morning; for it
is thereby that he obtains the object he desires. He need, therefore,
take no notice of that (practice).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:4">2:1:4:4</span></span>4.
They <span id="fr_676"></span>[2](#fn_672.md) then cook a rice-pap
sufficient for (the) four (priests) to eat, 'Hereby we gratify the
metres,' so they say, arguing that this is done in the same way as if
one were to order a team, which he is going to use for driving, to be
well fed. He need not, however, do this: for indeed that same wish
(which he entertains in so doing) he obtains by the very fact that
Brahmans, be they sacrificial priests or not, are residing in his family
(kula) <span id="fr_677"></span>[3](#fn_673.md): he need, therefore, take
no notice of that (practice).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:5">2:1:4:5</span></span>5. Having
then made a hollow in it (the pap) for

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

clarified butter to be poured in, and having poured clarified butter
into it, they anoint three sticks of a*s*vattha wood with this butter
and put them on the fire with the (three) *Ri*k-verses containing the
words 'kindling-stick (samidh)' and 'butter (gh*ri*ta) <span
id="fr_678"></span>[1](#fn_674.md);' arguing that thereby they obtain what
has grown out of a *s*amî <span id="fr_679"></span>[2](#fn_675.md). It is,
however, only by (daily) putting (three kindling-sticks) on the fire for
a whole year previous (to the Âdhâna) that one obtains that object: let
him therefore take no notice of that (practice).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:6">2:1:4:6</span></span>6. And on
this point Bhâllabeya remarked, 'If he were to cook that rice-pap, this
would assuredly

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

be a mistake, just as if one were to do one thing, while intending to do
another; or if one were to say one thing, while intending to say
another; or if one were to go one way, while intending to go another.'
And, indeed, it is not proper that they should either carry to the
south, or extinguish, that fire on which a kindling-stick is put, or an
oblation made, with a *rik* or a sâman or a ya*g*us. Now they do indeed
either take it to the south with the view of its becoming the
Anvâhâryapa*k*ana (or Dakshi*n*âgni), or (if there is to be no
Dakshi*n*âgni) they extinguish it <span id="fr_680"></span>[1](#fn_676.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:7">2:1:4:7</span></span>7.
Thereupon they <span id="fr_681"></span>[2](#fn_677.md) remain awake
(during that night). The gods are awake: so that he thereby draws nigh
to the gods, and sets up his fires as one more godly, more subdued, more
endowed with holy fervour (tapas). He may, however, sleep, if he choose,
since the observance of the vow is not necessary for him who has not
performed Agnyâdheya. For so long as he has not set up a (sacrificial)
fire of his own, he is a mere man; and he may, therefore, sleep, if he
choose.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:8">2:1:4:8</span></span>8. Now
some churn (the fire) <span id="fr_682"></span>[3](#fn_678.md) before
sunrise and

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

take it eastwards (from the Gârhapatya to the Âhavanîya) after sunrise,
arguing that thereby they secure both the day and the night for the
obtainment of out-breathing and in-breathing, of mind and speech. But
let him not do so; for when they thus churn (the fire) before sunrise,
and take it eastwards after sunrise, both his (fires) are in reality set
up before sunrise. By churning the Âhavanîya after sunrise he will
obtain that (combination of blessings).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:9">2:1:4:9</span></span>9. The
gods, assuredly, are the day. The fathers have not the evil dispelled
from them (by the sun); (and accordingly) he (the sacrificer) does not
dispel the evil (if he churns the fire before sunrise). The fathers are
mortal; and verily he who churns the fire before the rising of the sun,
dies before (he has attained his full measure of) life. The gods have
the evil dispelled from them (by the sun): hence he (the sacrificer)
dispels the evil (from himself, if he churn after sunrise). The gods are
immortal; and--though there is for him no prospect of immortality--he
attains (the full measure of life). The gods are bliss, and bliss he
obtains; the gods are glorious, and glorious he will be, whosoever,
knowing this, churns (the fire) after the rising of the sun.

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:10">2:1:4:10</span></span>10.
Here now they say, 'If the fire is not setup with either a *ri*k-verse,
or a sâman, or a ya*g*us, wherewith then is it set up?' Verily, that
(fire) is of the brahman: with the brahman it is set up. The brahman is
speech: of that speech it is. The brahman is the truth, and the truth
consists in those same (three) mystic utterances: hence his (fire) is
established by means of the truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:11">2:1:4:11</span></span>11.
Verily, with 'bhû*h* (earth)!' Pra*g*âpati generated this (earth) <span
id="fr_683"></span>[1](#fn_679); with 'bhuva*h* (ether.md)!' the ether;
with 'sva*h* (heaven)!' the sky. As far as these (three) worlds extend,
so far extends this universe: with the universe it (the fire) is
accordingly established.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:12">2:1:4:12</span></span>12.
With 'bhû*h*!' Pra*g*âpati generated the Brahman (priesthood); with
'bhuva*h*!' the Kshatra (nobility); with '*s*va*h*!' the Vi*s* (the
common people). As much as are the Brahman, the Kshatra, and the Vi*s*,
so much is this universe: with the universe it (the fire) is accordingly
established.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:13">2:1:4:13</span></span>13.
With 'bhû*h*!' Pra*g*âpati generated the Self; with 'bhuva*h*!' the
(human) race; with 'sva*h*!' the animals (pa*s*u). As much as are the
Self, the (human) race, and the animals, so much is this universe: with
the universe it (the fire) is accordingly established.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:14">2:1:4:14</span></span>14.
'Bhûr bhuva*h*!' this much he utters while laying down the Gârhapatya
fire; for if he were to lay it down with all (three words), wherewith
should he lay down the Âhavanîya? Two syllables <span
id="fr_684"></span>[2](#fn_680.md)

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

he leaves over, and thereby those (five syllables) become of renewed
efficacy; and with all the five syllables--'Bhûr bhuva*h* sva*h*'--he
lays down the Âhavanîya. Thus result eight syllables; for of eight
syllables consists the gâyatrî, and the gâyatrî is Agni's metre: he thus
establishes that (fire) by means of its own metre.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:15">2:1:4:15</span></span>15. Now
when the gods were about to set up their fires, the Asuras and Rakshas
forbade them, saying, 'The fire shall not be produced; ye shall not set
up your fires!' and because they thus forbade (raksh) them, they are
called Rakshas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:16">2:1:4:16</span></span>16. The
gods then perceived this thunderbolt, to wit, the horse. They made it
stand before them, and in its safe and foeless shelter the fire was
produced. For this reason let him (the Adhvaryu) direct (the Âgnîdhra)
to lead the horse to where he is about to churn the fire. It stands in
front of him <span id="fr_685"></span>[1](#fn_681.md): he thus raises the
thunderbolt, and in its safe and foeless shelter the fire is produced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:17">2:1:4:17</span></span>17. Let
it be one used as a leader <span id="fr_686"></span>[2](#fn_682.md); for
such a one possesses unlimited strength. Should he be unable to obtain a
leader, it may be any kind of horse. Should he be unable to obtain a
horse, it may also be an ox, since that (fire) is related (bandhu) to
the ox <span id="fr_687"></span>[3](#fn_683.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:18">2:1:4:18</span></span>18. And
when they carry that (fire) eastward <span
id="fr_688"></span>[4](#fn_684.md),

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

they lead the horse in front of it; so that, in proceeding in front of
it, it wards off from it the evil spirits, the Rakshas; and they carry
it (to the Âhavanîya) safely and unmolested by evil spirits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:19">2:1:4:19</span></span>19. Let
them carry it (the fire) in such wise that it turns back towards him
(the sacrificer); for, assuredly, that fire is the (means of) sacrifice,
and it is in the direction of him (the sacrificer) that the sacrifice
enters him, that the sacrifice readily inclines to him. And, verily,
from whomsoever it (the fire) turns away, from him the sacrifice also
turns away; and if any one were to curse him, saying, 'May the sacrifice
turn away from him!' then he would indeed be liable to fare thus.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:20">2:1:4:20</span></span>20.
Moreover, that (fire) is the (sacrificer's) breath: let them therefore
carry it in such wise that it turns

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

back towards him; for it is in the direction of him that the breath
enters into him. And, verily, from whomsoever it (the fire) turns away,
from him the breath also turns away; and if in that case any one were to
curse him, saying, 'May the breath turn away from him!' then he would
indeed be liable to fare thus.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:21">2:1:4:21</span></span>21.
And, verily, the sacrifice is yonder blowing (wind). Let them,
therefore, carry it in such wise that it <span
id="fr_689"></span>[1](#fn_685.md) turns towards him; for it is in the
direction of him that the sacrifice enters him, that the sacrifice
readily inclines to him. And from whomsoever it turns away, from him the
sacrifice also turns away; and if any one were to curse him, saying,
'May the sacrifice turn away from him!' then he would indeed be liable
to fare thus.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:22">2:1:4:22</span></span>22.
And, verily, that (fire) is the (sacrificer's) breath. Let them,
therefore, carry it in such wise that it turns towards him; for it is in
the direction of him that the breath enters into him. And from
whomsoever it (the fire) turns away; from him the breath also turns
away; and if any one were to curse him, saying, 'May the breath turn
away from him!' he would indeed be liable to fare thus.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:23">2:1:4:23</span></span>23. He
(the Adhvaryu) then makes the horse step on (the Âhavanîya
fire-place) <span id="fr_690"></span>[2](#fn_686.md). When he has made it
step on it, he leads it out towards the east, makes it turn round again
(from left to right) and lets it

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

stand there facing the west. The horse doubtless represents strength:
hence he makes it turn round again in order that this strength shall not
turn away from him (the sacrificer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:24">2:1:4:24</span></span>24. He
lays that (fire) down on the horse's footprint <span
id="fr_691"></span>[1](#fn_687.md); for the horse represents strength, so
that he thereby lays it down on strength: for this reason he lays it
down on the horse's foot-print.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:25">2:1:4:25</span></span>25. In
the first place he silently touches (the footprint with the burning
fire-wood). He then lifts it up and touches once more with it; and at
the third time he lays it down with (Vâ*g*. S. III, 5), 'Earth! ether!
heaven!' For there are three worlds indeed; so that he thereby obtains
these (three) worlds. This now is one (mode of laying down the fire).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:26">2:1:4:26</span></span>26.
Then there is this other. Silently he touches (the foot-print with it)
in the first place; he then lifts it up, and at the second time lays it
down with 'Earth! ether! heaven!' For he who wants to lift a load
without having a firm footing on this (earth), cannot lift it; nay, it
crushes him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:27">2:1:4:27</span></span>27.
Now, when he touches it silently he thereby takes a firm footing on this
resting-place; and having obtained a firm footing on it, he lays down
(the fire): and thus he wavers not. Here now Âsuri, Pâ*ñk*i, and Mâdhuki
held it (the fire) slightly to the back (or west of the
fire-place) <span id="fr_692"></span>[2](#fn_688.md). 'For,' they argued,
'everything else (that is on the hearth)

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

becomes, as it were, relaxed (on being touched by the fire): he should
therefore, after holding it up, lay it down at the first (touching) with
"Earth! ether! heaven!" for thus no relaxation takes place.' Let him
then do this in whichever way he may deem proper.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:28">2:1:4:28</span></span>28. He
(the sacrificer) then goes round to the east side (of the fire), and
taking hold of the top part of the burning sticks he mutters (Vâ*g*. S.
III, 5): 'Like unto the sky in plenty, like unto the earth in
greatness!' When he says, 'Like unto the sky in plenty,' he means to
say, 'Like as yonder sky is plenteous with stars, so may I become
plenteous!' and when he says, 'Like unto the earth in greatness,' he
means to say, 'As great as this earth is so great may I become!'--'On
that back of thine, O Earth, that art meet for the worship of the
gods'--for on her back he lays down that (fire)--'I lay down Agni, the
eater of food, for the obtainment of food.' Agni is an eater of food:
'May I become an eater of food,' this is what he thereby says. This is a
prayer for blessing,--he may mutter it, if he choose; or, if he choose,
he may omit it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:29">2:1:4:29</span></span>29. He
stands worshipping by (the fire) while muttering the (three)
*Ri*k-verses of the queen of serpents (Vâ*g*. S. III, 6-8) <span
id="fr_693"></span>[1](#fn_689.md),--'Hither has come that spotted bull and
has settled down before the mother; and before the father on going up to
heaven.--She moves along through the luminous spheres, breathing forth
from his breath: the mighty (bull) has illumined

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

the sky.--He rules over the thirty domains; and song is bestowed on the
winged one, yea, with the light at the break of day!' Thus he recites;
and whatever (benefit) has not been obtained by him either through the
equipments, or through the asterisms, or through the seasons, or through
the laying down of the fire, all that is thereby obtained by him; and
for this reason he stands worshipping by (the fire), while muttering the
verses of the queen of serpents.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:1:4:30">2:1:4:30</span></span>30.
They say, however, that one need not stand by (the fire) worshipping
with the verses of the queen of serpents. For the queen of serpents,
they argue, is this earth; and accordingly when he lays down the fire on
her, he thereby obtains all his desires: hence he need not stand by (the
fire) worshipping with the verses of the queen of serpents.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_670"></span>[291:3](sbe1243.htm#fr_674.md) See I, 1, 1, 7 seq.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[292:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_675.md) This practice is
perhaps the remnant of a former animal offering. See I, 2, 3, 6, where
the goat is mentioned as the last of the animals meet for sacrifice.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[292:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_676.md) That is, as would
seem, those ritualists who maintain that a goat should be tied up for
that night. The Kâ*n*va text reads, 'Here some cook that night that
*k*âtu*h*prâ*s*ya rice-pap, saying (vadanta*h*), "Hereby we gratify the
metres."' According to the Paddhati on Kâty IV, 8, the quotation 'Hereby
we gratify the metres' seems to form the last of the formulas pronounced
by the sacrificer, while washing the feet of the priests and offering
them food.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[292:3](sbe1243.htm#fr_677.md) 'The fulfilment of
that wish he obtains through Brahmans, whether officiating priests or
not, staying in his house (kula) and taking food there.' Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[293:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_678.md) The three verses
containing the words samidh and gh*ri*ta are Vâ*g*. S. III, 1, 3, 4.
Taitt. Br. I, 2, 1, 9-10 has them in the order 1, 4, 3; and does not
give the verse Vâ*g*. S. III, 2 (Rig-veda V, 5, s). As neither version
of our Brâhma*n*a makes any mention of this verse, it may be doubted
whether originally it formed part of the Sa*m*hitâ. According to Kâty.
IV, 8, 5-6 he (? the Adhvaryu) is to put on (the three kindling-sticks)
with Vâ*g*. S. III, i, &c., one verse with each stick; whereupon he,
(the sacrificer, according to the commentary) is to mutter III, 4; and
according to ib. 7 'the Adhvaryu optionally mutters the second.' The
Paddhati reconciles the different statements thus: he takes the sticks,
rises and puts the first on the fire with III, 1; then sitting down he
mutters III, 2; thereupon he again rises and puts on the second with
III, 3, and the third with III, 4. The commentator, however, alludes to
differences of practice in different schools as to this point.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[293:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_679.md) The sacrificial
fire, to be set up at the Âdheya, should probably be produced by means
of two pieces of a*s*vattha wood which has grown out of a *s*amî tree.
Sâya*n*a remarks that the ritualists referred to in our passage consider
that the cooking of the rice-pap takes place, not with the view of the
latter being eaten by the priests, but merely to afford an opportunity
for putting the kindling-sticks on the fire, and thereby securing to the
sacrificer the benefits that would have accrued to hire from the above
mode of ignition. This view, however, is not countenanced by our author,
who, on the contrary, favours the daily cooking of a mess of rice-pap
for the four priests for a twelvemonth preceding the Agnyâdheya, as a
substitute for the production of the fire by friction. See Kâty. IV, 8,
11 (and Paddhati).

<span id="fn_676"></span>[294:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_680.md) His argument seems
to be that, since the cooking of the rice-pap involves the putting on of
consecrated sticks with sacrificial formulas, one is not to cook the pap
because that same fire will afterwards have to be extinguished or to be
taken to the Dakshi*n*âgni hearth. The passage is, however, far from
clear to me.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[294:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_681.md) Viz. the ritualists
referred to; that is to say, they make the sacrificer and his wife
remain awake all night. Sâya*n*a takes *g*âgrati to stand for *g*âgarti,
'he, the sacrificer, remains awake.' The Kâ*n*va text, however, has,
'Here now they say, he should remain awake that night.'

<span id="fn_678"></span>[294:3](sbe1243.htm#fr_682.md) The production of
the sacred fire by means of two sticks (ara*n*i) of the a*s*vattha
(Ficus Religiosa) is thus described by Stevenson, 'Translation of the
Sâma Veda,' pref. p. vii: 'The process by which fire is obtained from
wood is called churning, as it resembles <span id="page_295">p.
295</span> that by which butter in India is separated from milk. The
New-Hollanders obtain fire from a similar process. It consists in
drilling one piece of ara*n*i wood into another by pulling a string tied
to it with a jerk with the one hand, while the other is slackened, and
so alternately till the wood takes fire. The fire is received on cotton
or flax held in the hand of an assistant Brahman.' On the mythological
associations of the agni-manthana, especially with the Teutonic
need-fire and the myth of Prometheus; and those of the a*s*vattha tree,
grown out of a *s*amî, with the mountain-ash (roun-tree, rowan-tree,
witch-elm, witchen, witch-hazel, witch-wood; eber-esche), see A. Kuhn's
epoch-making essay, 'Ueber die Herabkunft des Feuers and des
Göttertranks.'

<span id="fn_679"></span>[296:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_683.md) Compare XI, 1, 6,
3.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[296:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_684.md) Viz. sva*h*,
pronounced su-va*h*. In laying down the Gârhapatya he utters the first
two words, consisting of three syllables; and in laying down the
Âhavanîya he pronounces all three words, consisting of five syllables.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[297:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_685.md) The horse is to
stand east of the Gârhapatya fire-place, with its head to the west,
where, behind the khara, the Adhvaryu is about to produce the fire.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[297:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_686.md) Pûrvavah, 'drawing
in front,' i.e. a young (newly-harnessed) horse. The term may also mean
'conveying eastwards,' whence it is probably used here; cf. Taitt. Br.
I, 1, 5, 6.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[297:3](sbe1243.htm#fr_687.md) See XIII, 8, 4, 6,
where the ox is said to be sacred to Agni (âgneya). See also [p.
292](#page_292), note [1](#fn_671.md); and I, 2, 3, 6.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[297:4](sbe1243.htm#fr_688.md) The following
particulars, not alluded to by our author, have <span id="page_298">p.
298</span> to be supplied here from Katy. IV, 8, 29 seq., and the
commentaries: As soon as fire has been obtained from the two pieces of
wood, \[it is placed in a pan and covered with dry, powdered gomaya;
and\] the sacrificer blows it with 'Breath I bestow on the immortal;'
and the well-kindled flame he inhales with 'The immortal I bestow on the
breath' (see II, 2) 2, 15). The fire is then set ablaze with fire-wood
and laid down on the newly-made Gârhapatya hearth-mound with '\[Om!\]
Bhûr bhuva*h* sva*h*!' (Vâ*g*. S. III, 5); and with 'I lay thee down, O
Lord of Vows (vratapati), with the law (vrata) of N. N?'--the gotra-name
being inserted in the case of the Bh*ri*gus and Aṅgiras; and those of
different *Ri*shis or gods and divine beings in that of others. At the
sacrificer's bidding the Brahman or Adhvaryu then chants the
Rathantara-sâman (cf. [p. 196](sbe1231.htm#page_196.md), note
[2](sbe1231.htm#fn_446).md). Then follows the uddhara*n*a or taking out
fire from the Gârhapatya for the Âhavanîya. A bundle of wood is lighted
at the lower ends on the Gârhapatya and placed in a pan on an underlayer
of clay. It is then carried eastwards in such a way that the smoke is
directed towards the sacrificer following it; the horse being led in
front of the fire. At the starting of the procession the Brahman, at the
Adhvaryu's call, chants the Vâmadevya-sâman.

indicated by the backward-turned flame of the fire, as it is carried
eastwards to the Âhavanîya.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[299:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_690.md) The Adhvaryu sits
down and makes the horse put its right fore-foot on the recently
prepared hearth-mound. Having then led it eastwards and turned it round,
he calls on the Brahman to chant the B*ri*hat-sâman (see [p.
196](sbe1231.htm#page_196), note [2](sbe1231.htm#fn_446).md).

<span id="fn_687"></span>[300:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_691.md) Taitt. Br. I, 1, 5,
9, on the contrary, forbids the fire to be laid down on the horse's
foot-print, as the sacrificer's cattle is thereby surrendered to Rudra.
Moreover, the horse is there made to step beside, not upon, the
hearth-mound.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[300:2](sbe1243.htm#fr_692.md) The Kâ*n*va text
reads: Tad v Âsuri*h* Pâ*ñk*ir Mâdhukir iti dadhrire, 'here now they
held it thus.'

<span id="fn_689"></span>[301:1](sbe1243.htm#fr_693.md) These verses form
the hymn Rig-veda X, 189, the authorship of which is ascribed to the
queen of serpents (either Kadrû, or the earth, according to Mahîdhara).
