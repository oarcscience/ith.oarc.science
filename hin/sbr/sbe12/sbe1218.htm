Now in former times the gods appointed Agni to the chief (office), namely, that of Hot<I>ri</I>; and having appointed him to the chief (office) saying 'do thou carry this our oblation!' they cheered him up, saying, 'Surely, thou art vigorous; surely, thou art equal to this!' thereby endowing him with vigour, even as in our own days, when they appoint any one from among their kinsmen to the chief (office), they cheer him up saying 'surely, thou art vigorous; surely, thou art equal to this!' thereby endowing him with vigour.

Or, he, being the breath, sustains (bhar) these creatures: therefore he says 'O Bh&acirc;rata (sustainer)!'</p>

He now calls on (Agni as) the ancestral (Hot<I>ri</I> priest)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_304"></A><A HREF="#fn_303"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. He thereby introduces him both to the <I>Ri</I>shis and to the gods (as if he were to say), 'Of great vigour is he who has obtained the sacrifice!'

He (the Hot<I>ri</I>) also thereby propitiates the lord of seniority for him (the Sacrificer); for here among men the father comes first, then the son, and then the grandson: this is the reason why he calls from the remote end downwards.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_302"></A><A HREF="sbe1218.htm#fr_303">114:2</A> The invocations he now proceeds to recite, on the termination of the s&acirc;midhen&icirc;s or kindling verses, belong to the class of formulas called nigada. In the present case, they consist of the pravara mantra--or formula by which Agni is invited to assist the sacrificer as Hot<I>ri</I> or Invoker on the present occasion, as he has of old assisted his ancestors (cf. the following note)--and of short detached formulas called nivid. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a on Taitt. S. II, 5, 8.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_303"></A><A HREF="sbe1218.htm#fr_304">115:1</A> &Acirc;rsheyam prav<I>ri</I>n&icirc;te, literally 'he chooses the ancestral' (<I>ri</I>shi). I take '&acirc;rsheyam' as a masculine adjective qualifying a supplied '(Agni<I>m</I>) hot&acirc;ram.' In this way the formula is explained by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a on I, 5, 1, 9 (<I>ri</I>sh&icirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>m</I> sambandhinam adhvaryur hot&acirc;ra<I>m</I> v<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&icirc;te), and this seems to me the most natural interpretation. It is true, however, that, as the formula ('he chooses the ancestral') became stereotyped, its exact import became forgotten, and &acirc;rsheya was generally taken as a neuter, either adjective (viz. 'n&acirc;madheyam,' 'apatyam') or noun (ancestral lineage). Agni is invoked as the one who has of old officiated as the Hot<I>ri</I> of the sacrificer's ancestors, three or five ancestral names being usually mentioned: thus, in the case of a sacrificer belonging to the <I>G</I>&acirc;madagna Vatsa family, claiming Bh<I>ri</I>gu, <I>K</I>yavana, Apnav&acirc;na, Aurva, and <I>G</I>amadagni as its founders, Agni is invoked, on the present occasion, as 'Bhargava <I>K</I>yavana &Acirc;pnav&acirc;na Aurva <I>G</I>&acirc;madagna!' (&Acirc;<I>s</I>val. Sr. 12, 10, 6; S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a on Taitt. S. II, 5, 8). If the sacrificer belongs to the Kshatriya or Vai<I>s</I>ya castes, the priest substitutes for the sacrificer's ancestors those of his family priest (purohita) or his spiritual guide (guru); and in the case of kings the same course was adopted, or the names of their royal <I>ri</I>shi ancestors (r&acirc;<I>g</I>arshi) were chosen. As to the second pravara, or the election of the human Hot<I>ri</I>, for the present sacrifice, see I, 5, 1, 1. Cf. Max M&uuml;ller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 386 seq.; A. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 325 seq.; X, 78 seq.; M. Haug, Aitar. Br., Translation, p. 479.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_304"></A><A HREF="sbe1218.htm#fr_305">117:1</A> At this point of the recitation a pause is made, during which (as already partly during the preceding recitation) the Adhvaryu and &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra engage in the acts detailed in I, 4, 4, 13 seq. Cf. Hillebrandt, Neu and Vollm. p. 81.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_305"></A><A HREF="sbe1218.htm#fr_306">117:2</A> &Acirc;s-p&acirc;tram: the fire is, as it were, the vessel into which the sacrificial food is thrown and from which it is eaten by the gods.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_307"></A><A HREF="sbe1218.htm#fr_308">118:1</A> Here begins what is called the devat&acirc;n&acirc;m &acirc;vahanam, or invitation (lit, bringing) of the deities to the oblations. Whilst the Hot<I>ri</I> recites these formulas, the Adhvaryu performs what is set forth in I, 4, 5, 2 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_308"></A><A HREF="sbe1218.htm#fr_309">118:2</A> A<I>k</I>yuta, lit. 'not fallen,' i.e. immutable, invariable. For the legendary explanation of this epithet of Agni and his oblation, see I, 6, 1, 6; 2, 5-6.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_309"></A><A HREF="sbe1218.htm#fr_310">118:3</A> The three preceding invocations are used alike at the new- and full-moon sacrifices, but the subsequent ones differ according to the oblations that are made, viz. a rice-cake to Indra-Agni (or an oblation of mixed milk and butter to Indra) at the new-moon ceremony; and to Agni-Soma at the full-moon sacrifice. Previously to these an up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>uy&acirc;<I>g</I>a or 'low-voiced oblation' is made by some to Agni-Soma at the full moon, and one to Vish<I>n</I>u (or to Agni-Soma) at the new-moon sacrifice; according to others also one to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati,--the names of the gods being whispered in the respective formulas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_310"></A><A HREF="sbe1218.htm#fr_311">119:1</A> S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a on Taitt. S. II, 5, 9 explains the formula 'Bring hither the own greatness' by 'bring hither whatever greatness or power is peculiar to each of the havis-eating gods,' and he remarks expressly that it is not to be referred to Agni, as our author certainly appears to do. Cf. I, 7, 3, 13.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_311"></A><A HREF="sbe1218.htm#fr_312">119:2</A> <I>G</I>atavedas probably means 'he who knoweth (all) beings,' but it is more generally explained by 'he who possesseth riches (or wisdom),' not to mention other interpretations. According to Haug, Ait. Br. vol. ii. p. 224, the proper meaning of the term is 'having possession of all that is born, i.e. pervading it.' He further mentions that the <I>Ri</I>shis are quite familiar with the idea of the fire being an all-pervading power; and that by G&acirc;tavedas the 'animal fire' is particularly to be understood. Our present formula '&acirc; <I>k</I>a vaha <I>g</I>&acirc;taveda<I>h</I> suya<I>g</I>&acirc; <I>k</I>a ya<I>g</I>a' somewhat differs from the corresponding formula of the Taitt. S.
