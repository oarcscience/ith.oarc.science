### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:1">8:3:4:1</span></span>1. He
then lays down the Vâlakhilyâs;--the Vâlakhilyâs, doubtless, are the
vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus lays (into Agni). And as to why
they are called Vâlakhilyâs,--what (unploughed piece of ground lies)
between two cultivated fields is called

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'khila;' and these
(channels of the) vital airs <span id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_122) are
separated from each other by the width of a horsehair (vâla), and
because they are separated from each other by the width of a horse-hair,
they (the bricks) are called Vâlakhilyâs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:2">8:3:4:2</span></span>2. He
places seven in front, and seven at the back. When he places seven in
front, he thereby restores to him those seven (organs of the) vital airs
here in front.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:3">8:3:4:3</span></span>3. And
those seven which (he places) behind he thereby makes the
counter-breathings to those (first breathings); and hence by means of
(the channels of) these breathings he passes over the food which he eats
with those (other) breathings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:4">8:3:4:4</span></span>4. And,
again, as to why he places seven in front,--there are seven (channels of
the) vital airs here in the front part (of the animal) <span
id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_123)--the four upper and lower parts of the
fore-feet, the head, the neck, and what is above the navel that is the
sixth, for in each limb there is a vital air: this makes seven vital
airs here in front; it is them he thus lays into him (Agni-Pra*g*âpati).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:5">8:3:4:5</span></span>5. And as
to what seven (bricks) he places behind,--there are seven vital airs
here in the back part--the four thighs and knee-bones, the two feet, and
what is below the navel that is the seventh, for in each limb there is a
vital air: this makes seven vital airs here at the back; it is them he
thus lays into him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:6">8:3:4:6</span></span>6. \[He
lays them down, with, Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 21,22\], 'The head thou art, the
ruler! steady thou

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

art, steadfast! a holder thou art, a hold!'--'A guider, a ruler! a
guider thou art, a guide! steady thou art, a steadier!' he truly bestows
steady vital airs unto him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:7">8:3:4:7</span></span>7. And,
again, as to why he lays down the Vâlakhilyâs,--it was by means of the
Vâlakhilyâs that the gods then ranged over these worlds, both from hence
upwards and from yonder downwards; and in like manner does the sacrifice
now, by means of the Vâlakhilyâs, range over these worlds, both from
hence upwards and from yonder downwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:8">8:3:4:8</span></span>8. By
'The head thou art, the ruler!' they stepped on this (terrestrial)
world; by 'Steady thou art, steadfast!' on the air-world; by 'A holder
thou art, a hold!' on that (heavenly) world.--'For life-strength (I
bestow) thee! for vigour thee! for husbandry thee! for prosperity thee!'
There are four (kinds of) four-footed (domestic) animals, and (domestic)
animals are food: by means of this food, these four four-footed animals,
they (the gods) established themselves in yonder world; and in like
manner does the Sacrificer now by means of this food, these four
four-footed animals, establish himself in yonder world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:9">8:3:4:9</span></span>9. That
was, as it were, an ascent away from hence; but this (earth) is a
foothold: the gods came back to this foothold; and in like manner does
the Sacrificer now come back to this foothold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:10">8:3:4:10</span></span>10. By
'A guider, a ruler!' they stepped on that (heavenly) world; by 'A guider
thou art, a guide!' on the air-world; by 'Steady thou art, a steadier!'
on this ([terrestrial](errata.htm#1)) world.--'For sap (I bestow) thee!
for strength thee! for wealth thee! for thrift thee!'--There are four
four-footed (domestic) animals,

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

and (domestic) animals are food: by means of this food, these four
four-footed animals, they (the gods) established themselves in this
world; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by means of this food,
these four four-footed animals, establish himself in this world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:11">8:3:4:11</span></span>11. Now
as to the restoration (of Pra*g*âpati-Agni). Those eleven bricks he lays
down <span id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_124), which (constitute) that
first anuvâka <span id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_125), are the air and
this body (of Agni, the altar). And as to why there are eleven of these,
it is because the Trish*t*ubh consists of eleven syllables, and the air
is of the trish*t*ubh nature. And the sixty subsequent (bricks) are
Vâyu, Pra*g*âpati, Agni, the Sacrificer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:12">8:3:4:12</span></span>12.
Those which he places in front are his head: there are ten <span
id="fr_127"></span>[3](#fn_126) of them, because there are ten vital
airs, and the head is (the focus of) the vital airs. He places them in
front, because the head (of an animal) is here in front.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:13">8:3:4:13</span></span>13. And
those which he places on the right (south) side are that (part) of him
which is above the waist and below the head. And those at the back are
that (part) of him which is above the feet and below the waist. Those on
the left (north) side are the feet themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:14">8:3:4:14</span></span>14. And
the seven (Vâlakhilyâs) which he places in front are these seven vital
airs here in the forepart (of an animal): it is these he thus puts into

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

him (Agni). He places them so as not to he separated from those ten
(Prâ*n*abh*ri*ts): he thereby puts in vital airs that are not separate
from the head.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:4:15">8:3:4:15</span></span>15. And
the seven he places at the back (of the altar) are those seven vital
airs behind: it is these he thereby puts into him. He places them so as
not to be separated from those twelve (*Kh*andasyâs): he thereby puts
into him vital airs that are not separate from the body. That same
Vâyu-Pra*g*âpati is turned round in all directions in this
trish*t*ubh-like air; and when he lays down the third layer, having made
up both Vâyu (the wind) and the air, he thereby adds them to himself. He
then puts down two Lokamp*rin*â (space-filling bricks) in that
corner <span id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_127): the significance of them
(will be explained) further on <span id="fr_129"></span>[2](#fn_128). He
throws loose earth (on the layer): the significance of this (will be
explained) further on <span id="fr_130"></span>[3](#fn_129).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_122"></span>[55:1](sbe4314.htm#fr_123) Or, these bricks
representing the vital airs.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[55:2](sbe4314.htm#fr_124) Or, in the upper
part of man.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[57:1](sbe4314.htm#fr_125) That is to say, the
first eleven bricks of the third layer, viz. one svayamât*rinn*â, four
di*s*yâs, one vi*s*va*g*yotis, and four *ri*tavyâs.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[57:2](sbe4314.htm#fr_126) The formulas used
with these bricks, Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 11-16, constitute the first anuvâka of
the texts relating to the third layer (XIV, II-22).

<span id="fn_126"></span>[57:3](sbe4314.htm#fr_127) Viz. ten
Prâ*n*abh*ri*ts, see [VIII, 3, 2, 14](sbe4312.htm#8:3:2:14).

<span id="fn_127"></span>[58:1](sbe4314.htm#fr_128) Whilst, in laying
down the Lokamp*rin*âs of the first and second layers, he started from
the south-east and south-west corners respectively, in the third layer
he starts from the left hip (or north-west corner) of the altar, filling
up the available spaces in two turns, in sunwise fashion. Cf. [p.
22](sbe4306.htm#page_22), note [1](sbe4307.htm#fn_73); and [p.
41](sbe4310.htm#page_41), note [1](sbe4310.htm#fn_94).
