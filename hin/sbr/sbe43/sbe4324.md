### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:1">8:6:2:1</span></span>1. He
lays down *Kh*andasyâs <span id="fr_200"></span>[2](#fn_199) (bricks
pertaining to the metres). Completed now was the entire

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agni (fire-altar).
He now wished for distinction <span id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_200);
for, indeed, heretofore he was not equal thereto, that he should sustain
distinction; whence people here say even to this day, 'This one is not
equal to sustain distinction, either in regard to kingship or to
headmanship.' The gods bestowed on him this distinction, these
*Kh*andasyâs; for the metres (*Kh*andas) are cattle, and cattle are
food, and (a position of) distinction is food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:2">8:6:2:2</span></span>2. He
lays down triplets, for the beast is threefold--father, mother, son;
and, embryo, amnion, chorion; and food also is threefold--ploughing,
rain, seed. One of them is an Ati*kh*andas <span
id="fr_202"></span>[2](#fn_201) (excessive metre); for even whilst being
one, that one is beyond all the metres. And as to that distinction, it
is this great hymn of praise <span id="fr_203"></span>[3](#fn_202); and
as to this great hymn of praise, it is these *Kh*andasyâs.

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:3">8:6:2:3</span></span>3.
Gâyatrî verses are the head thereof, Trish*t*ubh verses the body,
*G*agatî verses the spine, and Paṅkti verses the wings; and of each of
those Kakubh verses he takes four syllables <span
id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_203), and adds them to

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

the Ati*kh*andas: that is just (what makes) that Ati*kh*andas (excessive
metre). The others result in Gâyatrîs: this is just that fourscore of
Gâyatrîs <span id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_204), the B*ri*hatîs (make up)
the Bârhata one, and the Ush*n*ihs the Aush*n*iha one. And as to the
Va*s*a hymn <span id="fr_206"></span>[2](#fn_205), the two half-verses,
the Aindrâgna (hymn), and the insertion, they are Atik*h*andas; and as
to

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

the Nada-verse <span id="fr_207"></span>[1](#fn_206), the Sûdadohas, the
pâda-appendages, and whatever Anush*t*ubh matter there is, they make up
the Anush*t*ubhs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:4">8:6:2:4</span></span>4.
Dvipadâ verses are the feet. Thus much is the great hymn of praise, and
the great hymn of praise means distinction: the gods bestowed upon him
(Agni) all that distinction, and so does this (Sacrificer) bestow upon
him all that distinction.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:5">8:6:2:5</span></span>5. And,
again, as to why he lays down the *Kh*andasyâs. The gods at that time
saw that firmament, the world of heaven, to wit, those Stomabhâgâs, and
entered it. Of those entering, Pra*g*âpati entered

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

last; and thus Pra*g*âpati is the same as these *Kh*andasyâs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:6">8:6:2:6</span></span>6.
Gâyatrîs are his head; and as to its being Gâyatrîs, it is because the
head is of Gâyatrî nature <span id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_207). There
are three, for the head is threefold. He places them on the forepart (of
the altar), for the head (of the animal or bird) is in front.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:7">8:6:2:7</span></span>7.
Trish*t*ubhs are the chest: he places them on the range of the two
Reta*h*si*k*; for the Reta*h*si*k* are the ribs, and the ribs lie
against the chest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:8">8:6:2:8</span></span>8.
*G*agatîs are the hips; at whatever distance from the
naturally-perforated (central) brick he places the Trish*t*ubhs in
front, at the same distance from it he places the *G*agatîs behind; for
that naturally-perforated brick is this vital air in the middle (of the
body), and as far from that vital air as the chest is in front, so far
are the hips behind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:9">8:6:2:9</span></span>9.
Anush*t*ubhs are the thighs: he places them close to the *G*agatîs, and
thereby places the thighs close to the hips.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:10">8:6:2:10</span></span>10.
B*ri*hatîs are the ribs, Kakubhs the breast-bone. The B*ri*hatîs he
places between the Trish*t*ubhs and Kakubhs, whence these ribs are
fastened on both sides, on the breast-bone and the costal
cartilages <span id="fr_209"></span>[2](#fn_208).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:11">8:6:2:11</span></span>11.
Ush*n*ihs are the neck: he places them close to the Gâyatrîs, and
thereby places the neck close to the head.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:12">8:6:2:12</span></span>12.
Paṅktis are the wings: and as to their being

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Paṅktis, it is
because the wings are of Paṅkti (fivefold) nature. He places them
sideways, for these wings are sideways. Whatever metre is larger that he
places on the right side: he thus makes the right half of the animal the
stronger, and hence the right side of an animal is the stronger.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:13">8:6:2:13</span></span>13. An
Ati*kh*andas is the belly; for the metres are cattle, and cattle are
food, and food is (what fills) the belly, because it is the belly that
eats the food: hence when the belly gets the food, it becomes eaten and
used up. And inasmuch as this (brick) eats (atti) the metres
(*kh*andas), the cattle, it is called Atti*kh*andas, for Atti*kh*andas
is really what is mystically called Ati*kh*andas; for the gods love the
mystic.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:14">8:6:2:14</span></span>14. A
(brick) covered with loose soil is the womb. These two he lays close to
each other, for the belly and the womb are close to each other. They are
connected with loose soil, for loose soil means flesh, and both the
belly and the womb are connected with flesh. The former is an
Ati*kh*andas, the latter a soil-bedded one (purîshavatî), for the belly
is higher, and the womb lower.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:15">8:6:2:15</span></span>15. He
places them so as to extend eastwards, for in an easterly
direction <span id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_209) this Agni (fire-altar)
is built; and, moreover, in one moving forward, both the belly and the
womb are moving forward. Outside the Stomabhâgâs (he places them), for
the Stomabhâgâs are the heart, and the heart is highest, then (comes)
the belly, then the womb.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:16">8:6:2:16</span></span>16. He
places them south of the naturally-perforated (brick). Now, in the first
layer, he places

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

both the belly and the womb north of the naturally-perforated one <span
id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_210); for that naturally-perforated one,
indeed, is what this vital air in the middle (of the body) is: he thus
places the belly and the womb on both sides of that (central) vital air,
and hence the belly and the womb are on both sides of that central vital
air.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:17">8:6:2:17</span></span>17. The
Dvipadâs are the feet (the stand);--and as to its being Dvipadâs (verses
of two feet), it is because the feet are a pair. There are three (such
verses), for a stand <span id="fr_212"></span>[2](#fn_211) (tripod) is
threefold. He lays them down at the back, for the feet are at the back
(of the body).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:18">8:6:2:18</span></span>18.
That body of his (Agni) is well-made;--and, indeed, for whomsoever they
thus make that body of his so as to be well-made, he becomes possessed
of that body of his as a well-made one; but for whomsoever they make it
otherwise than that, for him they make that body of his so as to be
ill-made, and he becomes possessed of an ill-made body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:6:2:19">8:6:2:19</span></span>19. It
is with reference to this that these two sâma-nidhanas (finales of
sâman-hymns) are uttered,--'The light (is) in the highest heaven of the
gods,' and, 'The gods (are) in the highest heaven of the

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

light;'--for when on that occasion the gods were entering (heaven),
Pra*g*âpati was the last to enter: that is why he says, 'The light (is)
in the highest heaven of the gods.' And as to why he says, 'The gods
(are) in the highest heaven of light,'--the light, doubtless, is this
Agni (the fire-altar), and it is on his highest layer that all the gods
have thus entered: this is why he says, 'The gods are in the highest
heaven of light.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_199"></span>[109:2](sbe4324.htm#fr_200) The *Kh*andasyâs
represent the principal metres, the formulas used in laying down the
bricks being composed in the respective metres. They consist of ten sets
of three bricks each, representing the ten metres, and an additional
(thirty-first) brick representing the Ati*kh*andas, or redundant metre.
Each of the ten sets consists of a central brick of full size (a foot
square) placed on one of the two spines, and flanked on the two sides
not in contact with the spines by two half-size bricks, viz.:--1.
gâyatrî at the east end of the 'spine'; 2. trish*t*ubh on the
Reta*h*si*k* range (joining the <span id="page_110">p. 110</span>
Gârhapatya on the front, or east, side); 3. *g*agatî, on the
Reta*h*si*k* range (joining the Gârhapatya on the west side); 4.
anush*t*ubh, immediately behind (west) of the preceding set; 5.
b*ri*hatî, immediately in front (east) of the Ashâ*dh*â range (on which
the ring of Stomabhâgâs lies); 6. ush*n*ih, immediately behind (west of)
the Gâyatrîs; 7. kakubh, immediately in front of the b*ri*hatî bricks;
8. paṅkti, at the right (south) end of the 'cross-spine'; 9. padapaṅkti,
at the left (north) end of the 'cross-spine'; 10. the single
ati*kh*andas, immediately in front (east) of the fifth Asapatnâ (see [p.
84](sbe4319.htm#page_84), note [1](sbe4319.htm#fn_169)); 11. (three)
dvipadâ at the back, or west, end of the 'spine.'

<span id="fn_200"></span>[110:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_201) That is, a position
of honour, or dignity (*s*rî).

<span id="fn_201"></span>[110:2](sbe4324.htm#fr_202) By the metres, here
and in the sequel, we have to understand bricks laid down with verses of
the respective metres (Vâ*g*. S. XV, 20 seq.).

<span id="fn_202"></span>[110:3](sbe4324.htm#fr_203) That is, the
so-called Great Litany (mahad uktham) recited, by the Hot*ri*, in
response to the Mahâvrata-sâman, or Chant of the Great Rite, at the
midday service of the last but one day--the so-called Mahâvrata day--of
the sacrificial session called 'Gavâm ayanam,' or 'cows’ walk.' The
Great Litany consists of numerous <span id="page_111">p. 111</span>
hymns, and some detached verses and prose formulas; the whole matter
recited being stated to amount to as many syllables as would make up a
thousand B*ri*hatî verses (of thirty-six syllables each)--or 36,000
syllables in all. From an analysis I have made of the Mahad uktham (or
B*ri*had uktham, as it is also called) as contained in MS. Ind. Off.
1729 D, I find it very difficult to check the accuracy of this
statement; my own calculation yielding somewhere about 37,200 syllables.
By leaving out of account the prose formulas, as well as certain
repetitions, this gross amount might, however, be reduced to something
approximating the stated number of syllables; and, indeed, the
calculation was probably not meant to be a strictly accurate one. Cf.
II, 3, 3, 19, 20 (where read Litany, instead of Chant), part ii, p. 430.
See also [IX, I, 1, 44](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:44); [3, 3,
19](sbe4337.htm#9:3:3:19); [5, 2, 12](sbe4344.htm#9:5:2:12).

<span id="fn_203"></span>[111:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_204) The three Kakubh
verses (Vâ*g*. S. XV, 38-40) consist each of three pâdas, of eight,
twelve, and eight syllables respectively, making together twenty-eight
syllables. In muttering these verses, whilst laying down the Kakubh
bricks, he is to omit four syllables from the middle pâda of each verse
(so as to make it equal to the other two pâdas), and mutter the words
thus omitted at the beginning of the verse (XV, 47) used in laying down
the Ati*kh*andas brick. The syllables omitted make up complete words in
each case, viz. 'bhadrâ râti*h*' at the beginning of the middle pâda of
the first verse, 'v*ri*tratûrye' at the end of the middle pâda of the
second verse, and 'ava sthirâ' at the beginning of the second pâda of
the third verse. The remaining portions of the Kakubh verses consist
each of twenty-four syllables, or a Gâyatrî verse. The references here
made to the different parts of the Mahad uktham are not quite clear, and
seem to point to a somewhat different arrangement of that *s*astra from
that known from the Aitareyâra*n*yaka and the *S*âṅkhâyana-sûtra. The
head, indeed, consists of Gâyatrî verses, viz. *Ri*g-veda I, 7., either
the whole, or, according to some, only certain verses of it; the first
three, or nine, verses also forming the opening triplet, or triplets, of
the Mahâvrata-sâman, the chanting of which precedes the recitation of
the Great Litany.--For the trunk (âtman) consisting of trish*t*ubh
verses, see [p. 113](#page_113), note [1](#fn_206). The Paṅkti verses,
on the other hand, said to form the wings, would seem to be *Ri*g-veda
VIII, 40 (consisting of mahâpaṅktis), <span id="page_112">p. 112</span>
which in the Aitareya arrangement forms the thighs, whilst Sâṅkhâyana
makes it part of the tail; and the *G*agatîs here referred to as
constituting the spine would seem to be X, 50, which immediately follows
the hymn just referred to, and is not otherwise identified with any
special part of the body. The MSS. of Harisvâmin's commentary are
unfortunately hopelessly corrupt in this place.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[112:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_205) The Great Litany
begins with seven sets of hymns and verses, meant symbolically to
represent certain parts of Agni-Pra*g*âpati's bird-shaped body which the
ceremony is intended to reconstruct, viz. the trunk, neck, head, the
roots (sinews) of the wings, the right and left wings, and the tail,
between each two of which the so-called Sûdadohas verse (*Ri*g-veda
VIII, 69, 3), meant to represent the vital air pervading the body, is
inserted, as it also is between (and before) the succeeding parts. In
the first place there follow three eighties of triplets (or, 3 sets of
240 verses each) in the Gâyatrî, B*ri*hatî and Ush*n*ih metres
respectively. Then comes the Va*s*a hymn representing the belly, and
finally a course of recitations (beginning with hymn VIII, 40) forming
the thighs. For the part which the number eighty plays in the
Agni*k*ayana ceremony, see Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 167. The term for
'eighty,' viz. 'a*s*îti,' gives rise to a constant etymological play.
Sâya*n*a, on Aitareyâra*n*yaka I, 4, 3, 1, takes it in the sense of
'food' (cf. above, [VIII, 5, 2, 17](sbe4320.htm#8:5:2:17)); whilst the
Âra*n*yaka itself takes it in that of 'obtainment':--yad evâsmin loke
ya*s*o, yan maho, yan mithuna*m*, yad annâdya*m*, yâ ’pa*k*itis tad
a*s*navai, tad âpnavâni, tad avaru*n*adhai, tan me ’sad iti.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[112:2](sbe4324.htm#fr_206) This is the hymn
*Ri*g-veda VIII, 46, ascribed to Va*s*a A*s*vya, and remarkable for the
variety of metres in which the different verses are composed. In the
Aitareya recension of the Mahad uktham (which is followed in the MS. of
this *s*astra referred to in the preceding notes) only the first twenty
verses are recited, but verse 15 being divided into two verses, a
dvipadâ and an ekapadâ, they are thus made to consist of twenty-one
verses.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[113:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_207) The Nada-verse,
*Ri*g-veda VIII, 69, 2 (in the ush*n*ih metre) deriving its name from
its first word 'nadam,' plays a peculiar part in the recitation of the
Great Litany. The opening set of recitations, representing the trunk,
consists of twenty-two trish*t*ubh verses; these are recited in such a
way that after each pâda (or quarter of a verse) one of the four pâdas
of the Nada-verse is inserted. The chief object of this insertion seems
to be a metrical one, viz. that of making each two pâdas (trish*t*ubh =
eleven, and ush*n*ih = seven syllables) to form half a b*ri*hatî verse
(eighteen syllables), the whole Litany being computed by b*ri*hatî
verses. Moreover, of v. 3 of the first Trish*t*ubh hymn of this set
(*Ri*g-veda X, 120) only the first two pâdas are recited at this stage
(whilst the remaining two are recited in different places later on), and
this half-verse is followed by a b*ri*hatî and a satob*ri*hatî pâda
(VII, 32, 23 c, and VI, 46, 2 c), after which the recitation proceeds
with verse 4 of the first hymn. This seems to account for one of the two
half-verses here referred to, whilst the other would seem to be VII, 20,
1 a, b, recited later on in the *s*astra. Cf. Prof. F. Max Müller's
translation of Aitareyâr., Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. 181
seqq.--The Aindrâgna hymn is VIII, 40, 1-9; 11; 12, being the first hymn
of the portion representing the thighs. It consists of ten mahâpaṅkti
verses (6 × 8 syllables)--each of which is split up into two Gâyatrî
verses (3 × 8 syllables)--and one trish*t*ubh verse.--The chief
anush*t*ubh verses are those of *Ri*g-veda I, 11, 1-8, which are recited
in a peculiar way (towards the end of the *s*astra), the last pâda of
each verse interchanging with the first pâda of the next verse.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[114:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_208) Either because the
Gâyatrî is the foremost and noblest of metres (whence its symbolical
connection with the priestly office and caste), and the one used for the
first stoma at the Soma-sacrifice; or on account of its being best
adapted for singing. For the threefold nature of the head, as consisting
of skin, bone, and brain, see XII, 2, 4, 9.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[114:2](sbe4324.htm#fr_209) That is, on both
sides of the chest; see XII, 2, 4, 11, with note.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[115:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_210) Or, as one tending
(flying) eastwards.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[116:1](sbe4324.htm#fr_211) According to VII,
5, I, 38, the fire-pan is supposed to represent the belly, and the
mortar the yoni; and these two were, in the first layer, placed north of
the svayam-ât*rinn*â, or naturally-perforated brick, so as to leave the
space of a full brick between them and that central brick of the layer;
cf. VII, 5, I, 13. In the sketch of the central part of the first layer
([p. 17](sbe4305.htm#img_01700)), the two northernmost bricks, marked
*p*, represent the fire-pan and mortar.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[116:2](sbe4324.htm#fr_212) That is, the feet
and back part of the body, or the tail, the latter, in a sitting bird
forming, as it were, a third foot or support to the body.
