### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:2:1">10:6:2:1</span></span>1. Now,
indeed, there is this twofold thing, to wit, the eater and that which is
eaten <span id="fr_820"></span>[1](#fn_807); and when this pair meets it
is called the eater, and not the eaten.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:2:2">10:6:2:2</span></span>2. Now
that eater is the same as this Agni (the fire and fire-altar); and
whatever they assign to him is his assignments; and these assignments
(âhiti) are mystically called oblations (âhuti), for the gods love the
mystic.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:2:3">10:6:2:3</span></span>3. And
the eater, doubtless, is the sun, and his assignments (offerings) are
the moon, for the moon is assigned to the sun <span
id="fr_821"></span>[2](#fn_808). Thus much as to the deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:2:4">10:6:2:4</span></span>4. Now
as to the body. The eater, doubtless, is the breath, and its assignments
are food, for the food is consigned to (the channel of) the breath. Thus
much as to Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:2:5">10:6:2:5</span></span>5. Now
as to the Arka (flame). The Arka, doubtless, is Agni; and his joy are
the oblations, for the oblations are a joy <span
id="fr_822"></span>[3](#fn_809) to Agni.

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:2:6">10:6:2:6</span></span>6. And
the Arka, doubtless, is the sun; and his joy is the moon, for the moon
is a joy to the sun. Thus much as to the deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:2:7">10:6:2:7</span></span>7. Now
as to the body. The Arka, doubtless, is the breath, and his joy is food,
for food is a joy to (the channel of) the breath. Thus much as to the
Arka.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:2:8">10:6:2:8</span></span>8. Now
as to the Uktha (song of praise). The 'uk,' doubtless, is Agni, and his
'tham' is oblations, for by oblations Agni rises (ut-thâ, i. e. blazes
up).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:2:9">10:6:2:9</span></span>9. And
the 'uk,' doubtless, is the sun, and his 'tham' is the moon, for by the
moon the sun rises. Thus much as to the deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:2:10">10:6:2:10</span></span>10.
Now as to the body. The 'uk,' doubtless, is the breath, and the 'tham'
is food, for by food the breath rises (increases). Thus much as to the
Uktha. That Agni-like, Arka-like, Uktha-like one is the same as the
Purusha; and, verily, the enemy withers away of whosoever, knowing this,
thus serves that Agni-like, Arka-like, Uktha-like Purusha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:2:11">10:6:2:11</span></span>11.
The fire, indeed, is kindled by the breath, the wind by the fire, the
sun by the wind, the moon by the sun, the stars by the moon, and the
lightning by the stars <span id="fr_823"></span>[1](#fn_810):--so great,
indeed, is the kindling both in this and in yonder world; and, verily,
whosoever knows this is enkindled to that full extent both in this and
in yonder world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_807"></span>[398:1](sbe4372.htm#fr_820) Or, as Sâya*n*a
takes it,--this (world) is twofold, the eater and the eaten.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[398:2](sbe4372.htm#fr_821) The moon here would
seem to be considered as serving for food to the sun, as it does to the
gods. The commentary is not very explicit on this
point,--tas*k*yâhutaya*s* (!) *k*andramâ*h* *k*andramasa*m* hy âditya
âdadhatîty anena *k*andramasa âditye âdhânâd âdhititva*m* pratipâditam.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[398:3](sbe4372.htm#fr_822) 'Kam' is used
adverbially 'well,'--they do him good, they please him.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[399:1](sbe4372.htm#fr_823) Agnir prâ*n*ena
