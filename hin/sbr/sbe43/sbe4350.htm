On the plan of the altar given in part ii, p. 419, the effect of this manipulation on the wings and tail is indicated by pointed lines.--S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a remarks,--ubhayata<I>h</I> pakshasya p&acirc;r<I>s</I>vadvaye, antarata<I>h</I> <I>k</I>ity&acirc;gner madhyade<I>s</I>e <I>k</I>atura&#7749;gulam upasam&ucirc;hati sa<I>m</I>karshati prave<I>s</I>ayat&icirc;ty artha<I>h</I>; b&acirc;hyata<I>h</I> agnimadhy&acirc;d b&acirc;hyade<I>s</I>e <I>k</I>atura&#7749;gula<I>m</I> vyud&ucirc;hati, ante vivardhayati.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_568"></A><A HREF="sbe4350.htm#fr_578">301:3</A> Literally 'outbendings' (nir<I>n</I>&acirc;ma)--'Schwunggelenke' (spring-limbs), St. Petersb. Dict.--This 'bending-limb' would seem to include the two inner segments of the (solid part of the) wing--those corresponding to the upper and fore-arm of man--as well as the adjoining and connecting joints or articulations, which portions may be taken roughly as forming the inner third of the wing when covered with feathers. The 'bending-limb' would thus derive its name from its 'bending,' or drawing, the wing 'out' from the body. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, however, explains it by 'nitar&acirc;<I>m</I> namati,' 'that which bends down,' as if it were formed from the prep. 'ni,' instead of 'nis.' The manipulation to which this part of the wing is to be subjected is, however, not quite easy to understand from the description, and the commentary affords very little assistance--vit<I>ri</I>t&icirc;ya iti pakshabh&acirc;ga<I>m</I> tredh&acirc; vibha<I>g</I>ya antare t<I>ri</I>t&icirc;yabh&acirc;ge nirn&acirc;makara<I>n</I>am . .; et&acirc;<I>m</I> <I>s</I>rutim apekshyaiv&acirc;pastambenoktam, &#8216;vakrapaksho vyastapu<I>k</I><I>kh</I>o bhavati, pa<I>s</I><I>k</I>&acirc;t pr&acirc;&#7749; (!) ud&ucirc;hati, purast&acirc;t pratyud&ucirc;hati, evam eva hi vayas&acirc;m madhye pakshanir<I>n</I>&acirc;mo bhavat&icirc;ti vi<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;yate&#8217; iti.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_570"></A><A HREF="sbe4350.htm#fr_580">302:2</A> That is, at the front edge of the wing of the flying bird, that which cuts through the air. The joint between the second and third segments of the wing, when expanded, would protrude, whilst on the opposite side of the wing the tops of the feathers would somewhat recede; but I am not sure whether this is what is referred to in these indications.</P>

The brick is apparently meant to represent symbolically the bone of the upper segment, or some tubular organ by which the vital air is supposed to enter the wing from the body.

Cf. &Acirc;pastamba's directions in note <A HREF="#fn_571">3</A> of last page. I fail to see, however, in what respect this manipulation differs from that referred to in paragraph 5; and whether the <A NAME="page_303"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 303</FONT></A> 'vakratvam' refers to the irregular shape, or to the curved nature, of the wings.</P>
