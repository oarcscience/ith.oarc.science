When the gods restored the relaxed Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, they poured him, as seed, into the fire-pan (ukh&acirc;) as the womb, for the fire-pan is a womb<font size="-1" color="green">.</font> In the course of a year they prepared for him this food, to wit, the fire-altar built here, and enclosed it in a body; and, being enclosed in a body, it became the body itself; whence food, when enclosed in a body, becomes the body itself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:4:1:2">10:4:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. In like manner does the Sacrificer now pour his own self (or body), as seed, into the fire-pan as the womb, for the fire-pan is a womb. In the course of a year he prepares for it (his self) this food, to wit, the fire-altar here built, and encloses it in a body, and, being enclosed in a body, it becomes the body itself; whence food, when enclosed in a body, becomes the body itself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:4:1:3">10:4:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. He places him (the Ukhya Agni, on the fire-altar) with 'Vausha<I>t</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_670"></A><A HREF="#fn_660"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!' for 'vauk' is he (Agni),</p>

<p><A NAME="page_342"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 342</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and 'sha<I>t</I> (six)' is this six-layered food: having prepared it, he offers it to him as proportionate to this body, for food which is proportionate to the body satisfies, and does not injure it; but when there is too much, it does injure it, and when there is too little, it does not satisfy it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:4:1:4">10:4:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. Now that Arka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_671"></A><A HREF="#fn_661"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (flame) is this very fire which they bring here; and the Kya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_672"></A><A HREF="#fn_661"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is this his food, to wit, the fire-altar built here: that (combined) makes the Arkya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_673"></A><A HREF="#fn_662"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in respect of the Ya<I>g</I>us. And the Great one (mah&acirc;n) is this (Agni), and this vrata&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_674"></A><A HREF="#fn_663"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (rite) is his food: that makes the Mah&acirc;vrata (s&acirc;man) in respect of the S&acirc;man. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food,--that (combined) makes the Uktha (<I>s</I>astra, recitation)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_675"></A><A HREF="#fn_664"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> in respect of the <I>Ri</I>k.

Now Indra and Agni were created as the Brahman (priesthood) and the Kshatra (nobility): the Brahman was Agni and the Kshatra Indra. When created, the two were separate. They spake, 'Whilst being thus, we shall be unable to produce creatures (people): let us both become one form!' The two became one form.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:4:1:6">10:4:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. Now those two, Indra and Agni, are the same as these two, to wit, the gold plate and the (gold) man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_676"></A><A HREF="#fn_665"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>: Indra is the gold plate, and Agni the man.</p>

Whatever is of brick that is Agni: whence they bake that (part) by fire, and all that is baked by fire is Agni. And what filling of earth there is (in the altar) that. is Indra: whence they do not bake that (part) by fire, lest it should be Agni, and not Indra.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:4:1:8">10:4:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. And the two become that one form, to wit, the fire which is placed on the built (altar), and hence those two, by means of that form, produce creatures. Now Agni, indeed, is this single brick&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_677"></A><A HREF="#fn_666"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and into this the whole Agni passes: this, indeed, is the perfection of bricks,--it is that one syllable (akshara) 'vauk,' it is this into which the whole Agni passes, and which is the perfection of syllables.</p>

Now for that seventeenfold Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati they prepared this seventeenfold food, the Soma-sacrifice: those sixteen digits of his are these sixteen officiating priests,--one should not, therefore, take a seventeenth priest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_689"></A><A HREF="#fn_678"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> lest one should do what is excessive;--and what vital sap there is here--the oblations that are offered--that is the seventeenfold food.</p>

The Arka (flame), doubtless, is the breath (vital air), and the Kya is its food: that makes the Arkya in respect of the Ya<I>g</I>us. And the Great one (mah&acirc;n) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that makes the Mah&acirc;vrata in respect of the S&acirc;man. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the <I>Ri</I>k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold.

In them they had heroic men on their side: what hero is there amongst us who will win that Soma-drink?'--'Here is that hero of yours,' said R&acirc;ma M&acirc;rgaveya. R&acirc;ma M&acirc;rgaveya was a <I>S</I>y&acirc;par<I>n</I>&icirc;ya, learned in sacred lore. When they rose to leave, he said, 'O king, will they turn out of the sacrificial ground even one so learned as me?'--'Whoever thou art, what knowest thou, vile Br&acirc;hman?'--'When the gods turned Indra away because he had outraged Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>'s son Vi<I>s</I>var&ucirc;pa, and laid low V<I>ri</I>tra, and thrown devotees before the jackals, and slain the Arurmaghas, and retorted on B<I>ri</I>haspati (the teacher of the gods)--then Indra was deprived of the Soma-cup; and along with him the Kshatriyas were deprived of the Soma-cup. By stealing the Soma from Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>, Indra obtained a share in the Soma-cup, but to this day the Kshatriyas are deprived of the Soma-cup: how can they turn out from the sacrificial ground one who knows how the Kshatriya race can be put in possession of the Soma-cup from which they are deprived?'--'Knowest thou (how to procure) that drink, O Br&acirc;hman?'--'I know it indeed.'--'Tell us then, O Brahman?'--'To thee, O king, I will tell it,' he said. Ultimately the <I>S</I>y&acirc;par<I>n</I>as are reinstated in their sacrificial duties. Cf. R. Roth, Zur Litteratur and Geschichte des Weda, p. 118. At VI, 2, I, 39, Sy&acirc;par<I>n</I>a S&acirc;yak&acirc;yana was stated to have been the last who was in the habit of immolating five victims instead of two, as became afterwards the custom.</P>
