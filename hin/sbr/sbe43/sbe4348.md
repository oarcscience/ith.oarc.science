### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:1">10:1:4:1</span></span>1. Now,
at the beginning, Pra*g*âpati was (composed of) both these, the mortal
and the immortal--his vital airs alone were immortal, his body mortal:
by this sacrificial performance, and by this order of proceeding, he
made his body uniformly undecaying and immortal. And in like manner is
the Sacrificer (composed of) both the mortal and the immortal--his vital
airs alone are immortal, his body mortal: by this sacrificial
performance, and by this order of proceeding, he makes his body
uniformly undecaying and immortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:2">10:1:4:2</span></span>2. He
lays down the first layer,--this, doubtless, is his out- (and in-)
breathing <span id="fr_547"></span>[1](#fn_538.md), and it is an immortal
(element), for the out-breathing is something immortal: this, then, is
an immortal layer. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this,
doubtless, is his marrow, and it is a mortal (element), for the marrow
is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby
this part of him becomes immortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:3">10:1:4:3</span></span>3. He
lays down the second layer,--this, doubtless, is his downward breathing,
and it is an immortal (element), for the downward breathing is something
immortal: this, then, is an immortal layer. He thus encompasses that
mortal (element) on both

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal.
He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his bones, and
it is a mortal (element), for the bone is mortal: he establishes it on
that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:4">10:1:4:4</span></span>4. He
lays down the third layer,--this, doubtless, is his
through-breathing <span id="fr_548"></span>[1](#fn_539.md), and it is an
immortal (element), for the through-breathing is something immortal:
this, then, is an immortal layer. He thus encompasses that mortal
(element) on both sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him
becomes immortal. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless,
is his sinews, and it is a mortal (element), for the sinew is mortal: he
establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him
becomes immortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:5">10:1:4:5</span></span>5. He
lays down the fourth layer,--this, doubtless, is his upward
breathing <span id="fr_549"></span>[2](#fn_540.md), and it is an immortal
(element), for the upward breathing is something immortal: this, then,
is an immortal layer. He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on both
sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal.
He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his flesh, and
it is a mortal (element), for flesh is mortal: he establishes it on that
immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:6">10:1:4:6</span></span>6. He
lays down the fifth layer,--this, doubtless,

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

is his central (or pervading) breathing <span
id="fr_550"></span>[1](#fn_541), and it is an immortal (element.md), for
the central breathing is something immortal: this, then, is an immortal
layer. He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on both sides by an
immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal. He then
scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his fat, and it is a
mortal (element), for the fat is mortal: he establishes it on that
immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:7">10:1:4:7</span></span>7. He
lays down the sixth layer,--this, doubtless, is his voice, and it is an
immortal (element), for the voice is something immortal: this, then, is
an immortal layer. He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on both
sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal.
He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his blood and
his skin, and it is a mortal (element), for blood is mortal, and skin is
mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this
part of him becomes immortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:8">10:1:4:8</span></span>8.
These, then, are six layers of bricks, and six layers of earth, that
makes twelve,--the year (consists of) twelve months, and Agni is the
year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much did
Pra*g*âpati then make his body uniformly undecaying and immortal; and in
like manner does the Sacrificer now make his body uniformly undecaying
and immortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:9">10:1:4:9</span></span>9.
Having then laid down the Vikar*n*î and Svayamât*rinn*â, he scatters
chips of gold, and places

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

the fire thereon: Pra*g*âpati then finally made a golden form for his
body; and inasmuch as (he did so) finally, this was the final form of
his body; whence people speak of 'the golden Pra*g*âpati <span
id="fr_551"></span>[1](#fn_542.md).' And in like manner does the Sacrificer
now finally make a golden form for his body; and inasmuch as (he does
so) finally, this is the final form of his body; and hence, whether they
know this or not, people say that the Agni*k*it (he who has built an
altar) is born in yonder world as one made of gold <span
id="fr_552"></span>[2](#fn_543.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:10">10:1:4:10</span></span>10.
Now, on this point, *S*â*nd*ilya and Sâptarathavâhani, teacher and
pupil, were once disputing with one another: 'This is his form,' said
*S*â*nd*ilya; 'his hair,' said Sâptarathavâhani.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:11">10:1:4:11</span></span>11.
*S*â*nd*ilya said, 'Surely, there is a hairy form (as well as) a
hairless form: his form it certainly is;' and this, indeed, is as
*S*â*nd*ilya has said: when it (the altar) is completely built, Agni is
led forward; and after he has been led forward, logs of wood <span
id="fr_553"></span>[3](#fn_544.md) are offered as 'oblations.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:12">10:1:4:12</span></span>12.
By means of (the channel of) the out- (and in-) breathing the gods eat
food, and Agni (the sacrificial fire) is the out-breathing of the gods;
whence it is in front (of the sacrificial ground) that offering is made
to the gods, for by means of the (channel of the) out-breathing the gods
eat food. By means of the down-breathing men eat food, whence food

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

is introduced into men (from the front) towards the back, for by their
down-breathing men eat food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:13">10:1:4:13</span></span>13.
Here, now, they say, 'He who has built an altar must not eat of any
bird, for he who builds a fire-altar becomes of a bird's form; he would
be apt to incur sickness: the Agni*k*it therefore must not eat of any
bird.' Nevertheless, one who knows this may safely eat thereof; for he
who builds an altar becomes of Agni's form, and, indeed, all food here
belongs to Agni: whosoever knows this will know that all food belongs to
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:4:14">10:1:4:14</span></span>14.
Here, now, they say, 'What is done here in (the building of) the altar,
whereby the Sacrificer conquers recurring death?' Well, he who builds an
altar becomes the deity Agni; and Agni (the fire), indeed, is the
immortal (element);--the gods are splendour: he enters splendour; the
gods are glory: he becomes glorious whosoever knows this.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[292:1](sbe4348.htm#fr_547.md) That is, the
breath-proper, of the mouth and nose, passing upward into the air from
the middle of the body.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[293:1](sbe4348.htm#fr_548.md) The Vyâna,
through-breathing, or circulating air, is the vital air which serves the
upward air (or out- and in-breathing, prâ*n*a) and downward air (apana).
Maitryup. II, 6 (Cowell).

<span id="fn_540"></span>[293:2](sbe4348.htm#fr_549.md) Or, outward
breathing,--'That which belches forth or keeps downwards the food eaten
or drunken, this is the udâna;' Cowell, ib.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[294:1](sbe4348.htm#fr_550.md) 'The Samâna
(equalizing air) distributes the digested pieces through the limbs.'
Maitryup. II, 6 (Cowell).

<span id="fn_542"></span>[295:1](sbe4348.htm#fr_551.md) Apparently an
allusion to Hira*n*yagarbha, the golden germ, or the golden egg (XI, I,
6, I), from which the Purusha, creator of the universe, arose. Cf. also
Aitareyâr. II, I, 3, with Sâya*n*a's commentary.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[295:2](sbe4348.htm#fr_552.md) Sâya*n*a assigns to
'hira*n*maya' the meaning 'of a colour resembling gold'
(hira*n*yasamânavar*n*a*h*).

<span id="fn_544"></span>[295:3](sbe4348.htm#fr_553.md) See [IX, 2, 3,
36](sbe4334.htm#9:2:3:36.md) seq.
