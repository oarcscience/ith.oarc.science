### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:4:1">10:3:4:1</span></span>1.
*S*vetaketu Âru*n*eya <span id="fr_648"></span>[2](#fn_638.md), once upon a
time, was about to offer sacrifice. His father said to him, 'What
priests hast thou chosen to officiate?' He said, 'This Vai*s*vâvasavya
here is my Hot*ri*.' He asked him, 'Knowest thou, Brâhma*n*a
Vai*s*vâvasavya,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:4:2">10:3:4:2</span></span>2. The
four great (things)?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest thou the
four great ones of the great?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest
thou the four rites (vrata)?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest
thou the four rites of rites?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest
thou the

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

four relating to Ka <span id="fr_649"></span>[1](#fn_639.md)?'--'I know
them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest thou the four deepest of those relating
to Ka <span id="fr_650"></span>[2](#fn_640.md)?'--'I know them, sir,' he
said.--'Knowest thou the four flames <span
id="fr_651"></span>[3](#fn_641.md)?'--'I know them, sir,' he
said.--'Knowest thou the four flames of flames?'--'I know them, sir,' he
said.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:4:3">10:3:4:3</span></span>3.
'Knowest thou the Arka <span id="fr_652"></span>[4](#fn_642.md)?'--'Nay,
but thou wilt teach us <span id="fr_653"></span>[5](#fn_643.md),
sir!'--'Knowest thou the two Arka-leaves?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach
us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the two Arka-flowers?'--'Nay, but thou wilt
teach us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the two pod-leaves <span
id="fr_654"></span>[6](#fn_644.md) of the Arka?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach
us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the two coops <span
id="fr_655"></span>[7](#fn_645.md) of the Arka?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach
us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the Arka-grains?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach
us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the bulge <span id="fr_656"></span>[8](#fn_646.md)
of

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

the Arka?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the root
of the Arka?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us, sir!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:4:4">10:3:4:4</span></span>4. Now,
when he said, 'Knowest thou the four great (things)? Knowest thou the
four great of the great?'--the great one is Agni (the fire), and the
great (thing) of that great one are the plants and trees, for they are
his food; and the great one is Vâyu (the wind), and the great (thing) of
that great one are the waters, for they are his (the wind's) food; and
the great one is Âditya (the sun), and the great (thing) of that great
one is the moon, for that is his food; and the great one is Man, and the
great (thing) of that great one is cattle, for they are his food:--these
are the four great things, these the four great of the great;--these are
the four rites, these the four rites of rites;--these are the four
relating to Ka, these the four deepest relating to Ka;--these are the
four flames, these the four flames of flames.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:4:5">10:3:4:5</span></span>5. And
when he said, 'Knowest thou the Arka?' he thereby meant man;--'Knowest
thou the two Arka-leaves?' he thereby meant his ears;--'Knowest thou the
two Arka-flowers?' he thereby meant his eyes;--'Knowest thou the
pod-leaves of the Arka?' he thereby meant his nostrils;--'Knowest thou
the two coops of the Arka?' he thereby meant his lips;--'Knowest thou
the Arka-grains?' he thereby meant his teeth;--'Knowest thou the bulge
of the Arka?' he thereby meant his tongue;--'Knowest thou the root of
the Arka?'

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

he thereby meant his food. Now that Arka, to wit, man, is Agni; and
verily, whoso regards Agni as the Arka and the man, in his (altar-) body
that Agni, the Arka, will be built up even through the knowledge that 'I
here am Agni, the Arka.'

<span id="fn_638"></span>[333:2](sbe4359.htm#fr_648.md) That is, grandson
of Aru*n*a (Aupave*s*i), and son of (Uddâlaka) Âru*n*i (II, 3, I, 35.
34; IV, 5, 7, 9).

<span id="fn_639"></span>[334:1](sbe4359.htm#fr_649.md) Sâya*n*a takes
'kya' to mean 'those useful to, or pleasing to (hita), Ka, i.e.
Pra*g*âpati.'

<span id="fn_640"></span>[334:2](sbe4359.htm#fr_650.md) Literally, 'the
four Kya of the Kya.' For more symbolical speculation on these terms,
see [X, 4, 1, 4](sbe4361.htm#10:4:1:4.md).

<span id="fn_641"></span>[334:3](sbe4359.htm#fr_651) Or, fires (arka.md),
used of the sun, the fire and the lightning, as well as of the Arka
plant. Sâya*n*a, however, here explains 'arkâ*h*' by 'ar*k*anîyâ*h*,'
'worthy of being praised, or honoured.'

<span id="fn_642"></span>[334:4](sbe4359.htm#fr_652.md) That is, the Arka
plant (Calotropis gigantea), apparently so called (= 'arka,' lightning)
from the wedge-like shape of its leaves. Cf. [IX, 1, 1,
4](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:4.md), where the leaf is used in offering the
*S*atarudriya oblations. The other meanings of 'arka,' especially that
of 'flame, fire,' however, are likewise implied in these mystic
speculations.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[334:5](sbe4359.htm#fr_653.md) Or, simply, 'Thou
wilt tell us, then (atha vai), sir.'

<span id="fn_644"></span>[334:6](sbe4359.htm#fr_654.md) ? Or, the pods,
sheaths; arkako*s*yau ko*s*yâkâre phale (or pu*t*ake). Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[334:7](sbe4359.htm#fr_655.md) ? Or, 'seas'
(samudra). Sâya*n*a explains it as two opened 'lip-parts' at the top of
the Arka-pod (arkako*s*âgre vidalitaush*th*abhâgau).

<span id="fn_646"></span>[334:8](sbe4359.htm#fr_656.md) That is, according
to the St. Petersb. Dict., 'the globular, cake-shaped, hardened cicatrix
of the Calotropis gigantea.' Sâya*n*a <span id="page_335">p. 335</span>
explains it by, 'arkako*s*amadhye vistare*n*a (? v. l. gihvâstâra*n*a-)
vartamânâ tûlî.'
