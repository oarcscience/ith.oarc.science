### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:2:1">8:1:2:1</span></span>1. And at
the back (western part of the altar), with (Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 56), 'This
one behind, the all-embracer;'--the all-embracer, doubtless, is yonder
sun, for as soon as <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) he rises, all
this embracing space comes into existence. And because he speaks of him
as (being) 'behind,' therefore one sees him only when he goes towards
the back (west). The Sun, indeed, having become the eye, remained
behind: it is that form he now bestows (on Agni).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:2:2">8:1:2:2</span></span>2. 'His,
the all-embracer's child, the Eye,'--from out of that (all-embracing)
form, the Sun, he fashioned the eye;--'the rains, the offspring of the
eye,'--from out of the eye he fashioned the rainy season;--'the
*G*agatî, the daughter of the rains,'--from out of the rainy season he
fashioned the *G*agatî metre;--'from the *G*agatî the *Ri*ksama,'--from
out of the *G*agatî metre he fashioned the *Ri*ksama hymn-tune <span
id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_50.md);--'from the *Ri*ksama

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

the *S*ukra,'--from out of the *Ri*ksama-sâman he fashioned the
*S*ukra-graha;--'from the *S*ukra the Saptada*s*a,'--from out of the
*S*ukra cup he fashioned the seventeen-versed hymn-form;--'from the
Saptada*s*a the Vairûpa,'--from out of the Saptada*s*a-stoma he
fashioned the Vairûpa-p*ri*sh*th*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:2:3">8:1:2:3</span></span>3. 'The
*Ri*shi *G*amadagni,'--the *Ri*shi *G*amadagni, doubtless, is the eye:
inasmuch as thereby the world of the living (*g*agat) sees and thinks,
therefore the *Ri*shi *G*amadagni is the eye.--'By thee, taken by
Pra*g*âpati,'--that is, 'by thee, created by Pra*g*âpati,'--'I take the
eye for my descendants,' therewith he introduced the eye from behind.
Separately he lays down (these ten bricks): what separate desires there
are in the eye those he thereby lays into it. Only once he settles them:
he thereby makes this eye one; but were he to settle them each
separately, he assuredly would cut the eye asunder. This is a threefold
brick: the meaning of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:2:4">8:1:2:4</span></span>4. And on
the left (upper, north) side, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 57), 'This, on the
upper side, heaven,'--in the upper sphere, doubtless, are the regions
(quarters); and as to why he speaks of them as being 'on the upper
(left) side,' the regions, indeed,

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

are above everything here. And as to why he says, 'heaven (or, the
light),' the regions, indeed, are the heavenly world (or world of
light). The regions, having become the ear, remained above: it is that
form he now bestows (on Agni).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:2:5">8:1:2:5</span></span>5. 'Its,
heaven's, child, the Ear,'--from out of that form, the regions, he
fashioned the ear;--'the autumn, the daughter of the ear,'--from out of
the ear he fashioned the autumn season;--'Anush*t*ubh, the daughter of
the autumn,'--from out of the autumn season he fashioned the Anush*t*ubh
metre;--'from the Anush*t*ubh the Ai*d*a,'--from out of the Anush*t*ubh
metre he fashioned the Ai*d*a-sâman <span
id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md);--'from the Ai*d*a the Manthin,'--from out
of the Ai*d*a-sâman he fashioned the Manthin cup;--'from the Manthin the
Ekavi*ms*a,'--from out of the Manthi-graha he fashioned the
twenty-one-versed hymn-form;--'from the Ekavi*ms*a the Vairâ*g*a,'--from
out of the Ekavi*ms*a-stoma he fashioned the Vairâ*g*a-p*ri*sh*th*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:2:6">8:1:2:6</span></span>6. 'The
*Ri*shi Vi*s*vâmitra,'--the *Ri*shi Vi*s*vâmitra ('all-friend'),
doubtless, is the ear: because therewith one hears in every direction,
and because there is a friend (mitra) to it on every side, therefore the
ear is the *Ri*shi Vi*s*vâmitra.--'By thee, taken by Pra*g*âpati,'--that
is, 'by thee, erected by Pra*g*âpati;'--'I take the ear for my
descendants,'

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --therewith he
introduced the ear from the left (or upper) side. Separately he lays
down (these bricks): what separate desires there are in the ear, those
he thereby lays into it. Only once he settles them: he thereby makes the
ear one; but were he to settle them each separately, he assuredly would
cut the ear asunder. This is a threefold brick: the meaning of this has
been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:2:7">8:1:2:7</span></span>7. Then
in the centre, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 58), 'This one, above, the
mind,'--above, doubtless, is the moon; and as to why he speaks of him as
(being) 'above,' the moon is indeed above; and as to why he says, 'the
mind,' the mind (mati), doubtless, is speech, for by means of speech
everything thinks (man) here <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md). The
moon, having become speech, remained above: it is that form he now
bestows (on. Agni).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:2:8">8:1:2:8</span></span>8. 'Its,
the mind's, daughter, Speech,'--from out of that form, the moon, he
fashioned speech;--'Winter, the son of Speech,'--from out of speech he
fashioned the winter season;--'Paṅkti, the daughter of Winter,'--from
out of the winter season he fashioned the Paṅkti metre;--'from the
Paṅkti the Nidhanavat,'--from out of the Paṅkti metre he fashioned the
Nidhanavat-sâman <span id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53.md);--'from the
Nidhanavat the Âgraya*n*a,'--from out of the Nidhanavat-sâman he
fashioned the Âgraya*n*a cup;--'from the Âgraya*n*a the Tri*n*ava and
Trayastri*ms*a,'--from out of the Âgraya*n*a-graha he fashioned the
thrice-nine-versed and the three-and-thirty-versed hymn-forms;--

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'from the
Tri*n*ava and Trayastri*ms*a the *S*âkvara and Raivata,'--from out of
the Tri*n*ava and Trayastri*ms*a-stomas he fashioned the *S*âkvara and
Raivata-p*ri*sh*th*as <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:2:9">8:1:2:9</span></span>9. 'The
*Ri*shi Vi*s*vakarman,'--the *Ri*shi Vi*s*vakarman ('the all-worker'),
doubtless, is Speech, for by speech everything here is done: hence the
*Ri*shi Vi*s*vakarman is speech:--'By thee, taken by Pra*g*âpati,'--that
is, 'by thee, created by Pra*g*âpati;'--'I take speech for my
descendants,'--therewith he introduced speech from above. Separately he
lays down (these bricks): what separate desires there are in speech,
those he now lays into it. Only once he settles them: he thereby makes
speech one; but were he to settle them each separately, he assuredly
would cut speech asunder. This is a threefold brick: the meaning of this
has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:2:10">8:1:2:10</span></span>10.
This, then, is that same food which both the vital airs and Pra*g*âpati
created: just so great indeed is the whole sacrifice, and the sacrifice
is the food of the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:2:11">8:1:2:11</span></span>11. He
lays them down by ten and ten,--of ten syllables consists the Virâ*g*
(metre), and the Virâ*g* is all food: he thus bestows on him (Agni) the
whole food. He puts them down on every side: on every side he thus
bestows the whole food on him. And verily these same Virâ*g* (verses)
sustain those vital airs, and inasmuch as they sustain (bh*ri*) the
vital airs (prâ*n*a) they are called Prânabh*ri*ta*h*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_49"></span>[8:1](sbe4304.htm#fr_49.md) Or, perhaps, 'only
when' (yadâ-eva).

<span id="fn_50"></span>[8:2](sbe4304.htm#fr_50.md) No explanation of this
sâman has been found anywhere. Sâya*n*a, on the corresponding formula,
Taitt. S. IV, 3, 4, 2 (where the term is spelt *ri*kshama), merely
remarks that it is a kind of sâman.' The meaning of the term 'similar to
a *rik*' would seem to indicate a hymn-tune involving little, or no,
modification of the text chanted to it. At V, 4, 1, 5 it is the
Vairûpa-sâman which (together with the *G*agatî, the Saptada*s*a-stoma,
the rainy season, and the Vi*s*) is in this way connected with the West.
Now the textual parts of the Pa*ñk*anidhana*m* Vairûpam (Sâma-v., vol.
v, pp. 387, 575-6), ordinarily used as a p*ri*sh*th*a-sâman, show <span
id="page_9">p. 9</span> hardly any modifications on the original verses
(Sâma-v., vol. ii, p. 278), even less so indeed than the simple
Vairûpa-sâman ([Sâma](errata.htm#0)-v., vol. i, p. 572.md), and possibly
'*ri*ksama' (if it does not apply to a whole class of sâmans) may be
another name for the Vairûpa (of which there are two other forms,
Sâma-v., vol. i, pp. 425, 438) in its simplest form. The Vairûpa, in its
p*ri*sh*th*a form, would in that case, indeed, have originated from the
*Ri*ksama-sâman. It is true, however, that there is no special
connection between the other P*ri*sh*th*a-sâmans and the respective
hymn-tune with which they are symbolically connected in the foregoing
formulas.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[10:1](sbe4304.htm#fr_51.md) Ai*d*a-sâmans are
those sâmans which have the word 'i*d*â' for their nidhana, or chorus.
Such sâmans are, e*g*. the Vairûpa (Sâma-v., vol. V, p. 387) and the
Raurava (iii, 83), the latter of which forms the central sâman of the
Mâdhyandina-pavamâna-stotra. What connection there can be between the
Ai*d*a and the Vairâ*g*a-p*ri*sh*th*a (Sâma-v., vol. v, p. 391; cf. vol.
i, pp. 814-5) it is not easy to see. In *S*at. Br. V, 4,i, 6 the North
is connected with the Anush*t*ubh, the Vairâ*g*a-sâman, the Ekavi*ms*a
and the autumn.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[11:1](sbe4304.htm#fr_52.md) Or, perhaps, one
thinks everything here.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[11:2](sbe4304.htm#fr_53.md) That is a sâman which
has a special nidhana, or chorus, added at the end (or inserted in the
middle) of it.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[12:1](sbe4304.htm#fr_54.md) For these
P*ri*sh*th*a-sâmans see part iii, introd. pp. xx-xxi. In V, 4, I, 7 the
upper region is symbolically connected with the Paṅkti metre, the
*S*âkvara and Raivata-sâmans, the Tri*n*ava and Trayastri*ms*a-stomas,
and the winter and dewy seasons.
