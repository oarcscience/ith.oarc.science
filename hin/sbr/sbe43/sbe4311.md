#### THE THIRD LAYER.

### THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:1">8:3:1:1</span></span>1. He
lays down the third layer. For the gods, having laid down the second
layer, now ascended it; but, indeed, they thereby completed and ascended
to what is above the earth and below the atmosphere.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:2">8:3:1:2</span></span>2. They
spate, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a
layer! Seek ye (to build) upwards from hence!' Whilst meditating, they
saw the great third layer, even the air: that world pleased them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:3">8:3:1:3</span></span>3. They
said to Indra and Agni, 'Lay ye down for us this third layer!'--'What
will accrue unto us therefrom? Ye two shall be the best of us!'--'So be
it!' Accordingly Indra and Agni laid down for them that third layer; and
hence people say, 'Indra and Agni are the best of gods.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:4">8:3:1:4</span></span>4. He
accordingly lays it down by means of Indra and Agni, and settles it by
means of Vi*s*vakarman <span id="fr_98"></span>[4](#fn_97),

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

for indeed Indra and Agni, as well as Vi*s*vakarman, saw this third
layer: this is why he lays it down by means of Indra and Agni, and
settles it by means of Vi*s*vakarman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:5">8:3:1:5</span></span>5. And,
again, as to why he lays it down by means of Indra and Agni, and settles
it by means of Vi*s*vakarman. When Pra*g*âpati had become relaxed
(disjointed), the deities took him and went off in different directions.
Indra and Agni, and Vi*s*vakarman took his middle part, and kept going
away from him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:6">8:3:1:6</span></span>6. He
said to them, 'Come ye to me and restore ye to me wherewith ye are going
from me!'--'What will accrue unto us therefrom?'--'That (part) of my
body shall be sacred unto you!'--'So be it!' So Indra and Agni, and
Vi*s*vakarman restored that (part) unto him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:7">8:3:1:7</span></span>7. Now
that central Svayam-ât*rinn*â (naturally-perforated brick) <span
id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_98) is that very (part) of his body;--when he
now lays down that (brick), he thereby restores to him that (part) of
his (Pra*g*âpati's) body which this (brick represents): this is why he
now lays down that (brick).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:8">8:3:1:8</span></span>8.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 11\], 'O Indra and Agni, make ye fast the brick so as
not to shake!' as the text so the sense;--'with thy back thou forcest
asunder the earth, and the sky, and the air;' for with its back this
(brick) indeed forces asunder the earth, and the sky, and the air.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:9">8:3:1:9</span></span>9.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 12\], 'May Vi*s*vakarman settle

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

thee,' for Vi*s*vakarman saw this third layer;--'on the back of the air,
thee the wide, the broad one!' for this (brick) indeed is the wide and
broad back of the air;--'support thou the air, make fast the air, injure
not the air!' that is, 'support thou thine own self (body), make fast
thine own self, injure not thine own self!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:10">8:3:1:10</span></span>10.
'For all up-breathing, and dawn-breathing, and through-breathing, and
out-breathing!' for the naturally-perforated (brick) is the vital air,
and the vital air serves for everything here;--'for a resting-place and
moving-place!' for the naturally-perforated (brick) is these worlds, and
these worlds are indeed a resting-place and a moving-place;--'May Vâyu
shelter thee!' that is, 'May Vâyu protect thee!'--'with grand
prosperity!' that is, 'with great prosperity;'--'with most auspicious
protection!'--that is, with what protection is most auspicious.' Having
settled it <span id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_99), he pronounces the
Sûdadohas <span id="fr_101"></span>[2](#fn_100) over it; the meaning of
this has been explained. He then sings a sâman: the meaning of this
(will be explained) further on <span id="fr_102"></span>[3](#fn_101).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:11">8:3:1:11</span></span>11. He
then lays down (five) Di*s*yâ (regional bricks) <span
id="fr_103"></span>[4](#fn_102). Now the regional ones, doubtless, are

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

the regions: it is the regions he thus bestows (on the air-world). And
these are those same regions not separated (from the air) wherewith Vâyu
on that occasion <span id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_103) stepped nigh: it
is them he thereby bestows. But prior to these same (bricks) he lays
down <span id="fr_105"></span>[2](#fn_104) both the bunch of Darbha
grass and the clod-bricks; and these (di*s*yâs) being yonder sun <span
id="fr_106"></span>[3](#fn_105), he thus places yonder sun over the
regions, and builds him up upon (or, in) the regions. But were these
(laid down) at the same time (as the bunch of grass and the
clod-bricks), they would be outside (of the altar); and outside of the
womb (foundation), indeed, is that sacrificial work regarding the
fire-altar which is done prior to the lotus-leaf <span
id="fr_107"></span>[4](#fn_106). When he

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

now brings and lays down these (bricks), he thereby establishes them in
the womb, on the lotus-leaf, and thus these (bricks) are not outside
(the fire-altar). He lays them down so as not to be separated <span
id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_107) from the naturally-perforated one; for
the middle <span id="fr_109"></span>[2](#fn_108) naturally-perforated
one is the air: he thus places the regions so as not to be separate from
the air. Subsequently <span id="fr_110"></span>[3](#fn_109) (to the
central brick he lays them down): subsequently to the air he thus sets
up the regions. In all (four) directions he places them: he thus places
the regions (quarters) in all directions, whence the regions are in all
(four) directions. \[He places them\] on all sides so as to face each
other: he thereby makes the regions on all sides face each other, and
hence the regions on all sides face each other <span
id="fr_111"></span>[4](#fn_110).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:12">8:3:1:12</span></span>12.
And, again, as to why he lays down the regionals. The regions,
doubtless, are the metres--the eastern region being the Gâyatrî, the
southern the Trish*t*ubh, the western the *G*agatî, the northern the
Anush*t*ubh, and the upper region the Paṅkti;--and the metres are
animals <span id="fr_112"></span>[5](#fn_111), and the middlemost layer
is the air: he thus places animals in the air,

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

and hence there are animals that have their abode in the air <span
id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_112).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:13">8:3:1:13</span></span>13.
And, again, as to why he lays down the regionals. The regions,
doubtless, are the metres, and the metres are animals, and animals are
food, and the middlemost layer is the middle: he thus puts food in the
middle (of the body). He places them so as not to be separated (by
special bricks) from the naturally-perforated one; for the
naturally-perforated one is the vital air: he thus places the food so as
not to be separated from the vital air. Subsequently (to the central
brick he lays them down): subsequently to (or upon) the vital air he
thus places food. On the range of the Reta*h*si*k* (he places them): the
Reta*h*si*k* being the ribs, and the ribs being the middle (of the
body), he thus places the food in the middle of this (Agni's body). On
every side he places them: from everywhere he thus supplies him with
food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:1:14">8:3:1:14</span></span>14.
\[He lays them down, with, Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 13\], 'Thou art the queen, the
Eastern region! Thou art the far-ruler, the Southern region! Thou art
the all-ruler, the Western region! Thou art the self-ruler, the Northern
region! Thou art the supreme ruler, the Great region!' these are their
names: he thus lays them down whilst naming them. Separately he lays
them down, separately he settles them, and separately he pronounces the
Sûdadohas over them, for separate are the regions.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_97"></span>[41:4](sbe4311.htm#fr_98) For the connection of
these deities with the third layer, and the <span id="page_42">p.
42</span> air, see also VI, 2, 3, 3. Vi*s*vakarman is likewise the deity
by which the Vi*s*va*g*yotis-brick, representing Vâyu (the wind), the
regent of the air-world, is settled; see [VIII, 3, 2,
3](sbe4312.htm#8:3:2:3).

<span id="fn_98"></span>[42:1](sbe4311.htm#fr_99) See part iii, p. 155,
note 8.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[43:1](sbe4311.htm#fr_100) Viz. by the
concluding formula, 'With the help of that deity, Aṅgiras-like, lie thou
steady!' see part iii, p. 302, note 3.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[43:2](sbe4311.htm#fr_101) Viz. Vâ*g*. S. XII,
55 (*Ri*g-veda S. VIII, 69, 3), 'At his birth the well-like milking,
speckled ones mix the Soma, the clans of the gods in the three spheres
of the heavens.' See part iii, p. 307, note 2.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[43:3](sbe4311.htm#fr_102) [VIII, 7, 4,
1](sbe4329.htm#8:7:4:1) seq.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[43:4](sbe4311.htm#fr_103) The five Di*s*yâs
are placed on the spines in the four directions at the reta*h*si*k*
range, just over where the five Vai*s*vadevî bricks were placed in the
second layer (see the sketch, [p. 24](sbe4307.htm#img_02400)). Between
them and the central (naturally-perforated) brick there is thus an <span
id="page_44">p. 44</span> empty space a foot square, and the two
southern Di*s*yâs are half-bricks lying north and south of each other.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[44:1](sbe4311.htm#fr_104) See VI, 2, 3, 4. The
second naturally-perforated brick represents the air-world with which
Vâyu, the wind, is most closely associated.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[44:2](sbe4311.htm#fr_105) That is to say, he
laid them down on the site of the altar, before the first layer was
commenced, viz. the darbha-bunch in the centre of the 'body' of the
altar, where the two spines (anûka) intersect each other (VII, 2, 3, 1
seqq.); and the clod-bricks (logesh*t*akâ) on the four ends of the two
spines (VII, 3, 1, 23 seqq.), that is, in the middle of each of the four
sides of the square of which the body' consists.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[44:3](sbe4311.htm#fr_106) The symbolic
interpretation here seems somewhat confused, inasmuch as the Di*s*yâs,
which are now apparently identified with the sun, have just been stated
to represent the regions. At VI, 7, 1, 17 the sun was represented as the
central point of the universe to which these three worlds are linked by
means of the quarters (as by the strings of a scale). The clod-bricks,
on the other hand, were indeed, in VII, 3, I, 13, identified with the
regions (quarters); and the bunch of grass, being laid down in the
centre, might be regarded as marking the fifth region, that upwards from
here. Cf. [IX, 5, 1, 36](sbe4343.htm#9:5:1:36).

<span id="fn_106"></span>[44:4](sbe4311.htm#fr_107) The lotus-leaf is
placed in the centre of the altar when the first layer is about to be
laid down. See [VII, 4, 1, 7](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:7) seqq., where <span
id="page_45">p. 45</span> it is explained as representing the foundation
of the fire-altar, or rather, the womb whence Agni is born.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[45:1](sbe4311.htm#fr_108) That is, not
separated therefrom by other special bricks; though the full space of
one brick is left between the Di*s*yâs and the central brick. Perhaps,
however, 'anantarhita' here means 'immediately after.'

<span id="fn_108"></span>[45:2](sbe4311.htm#fr_109) That is, the second
of the three svayam-ât*rinn*âs, the one in the third layer.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[45:3](sbe4311.htm#fr_110) Uttara seems here
and elsewhere to have a double meaning, viz. that of subsequent, and
upper, or left, inasmuch as looking towards these bricks from the centre
of the altar, they are placed to the left of the particular section of
the anûkas.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[45:4](sbe4311.htm#fr_111) See [p.
26](sbe4307.htm#page_26), note [3](sbe4307.htm#fn_81).

<span id="fn_111"></span>[45:5](sbe4311.htm#fr_112) The metres are
commonly represented as cattle.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[46:1](sbe4311.htm#fr_113) That is all
(four-footed) animals that dwell on, not in, the earth. The Gâyatrî
metre, at any rate, is also represented as a bird which fetches the Soma
from heaven, but it is not the air as such that is intended here, but
the face of the earth.
