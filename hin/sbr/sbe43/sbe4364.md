### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:4:1">10:4:4:1</span></span>1. When
Pra*g*âpati was creating living beings, Death, that evil, overpowered
him. He practised austerities for a thousand years, striving to leave
evil behind him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:4:2">10:4:4:2</span></span>2.
Whilst he was practising austerities, lights went upwards from those
hair-pits <span id="fr_713"></span>[3](#fn_701.md) of his; and those lights
are those stars: as many stars as there are, so many hair-pits there
are; and as many hair-pits as there are, so many muhûrtas there are in a
(sacrificial performance) of a thousand years.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:4:3">10:4:4:3</span></span>3. In
the one-thousandth year, he cleansed himself all through; and he that
cleansed all through is this wind which here cleanses by blowing; and
that evil which he cleansed all through is this body.

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But what is man
that he could secure for himself a (life) of a thousand years <span
id="fr_714"></span>[1](#fn_702.md)? By knowledge, assuredly, he who knows
secures for himself (the benefits of a performance) of a thousand years.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:4:4">10:4:4:4</span></span>4. Let
him look upon all these bricks as a thousandfold: let him look upon each
enclosing-stone as charged with a thousand nights, each day-holder <span
id="fr_715"></span>[2](#fn_703.md) with a thousand days, each
half-moon-holder with a thousand half-moons, each month-holder with a
thousand months, each season-holder with a thousand seasons, each
muhûrta-holder <span id="fr_716"></span>[3](#fn_704.md) with a thousand
muhûrtas, and the year with a thousand years. They who thus know this
Agni as being endowed with a thousand, know his one-thousandth digit;
but they who do not thus know him, do not even know a one-thousandth
digit of him. And he alone who so knows this, or who performs this
sacred work, obtains this whole and complete Pra*g*âpatean Agni whom
Pra*g*âpati obtained. Wherefore let him who knows this by all means
practise austerities <span id="fr_717"></span>[4](#fn_705.md); for, indeed,
when he who knows this practises austerities, even to (abstention from)
sexual intercourse, every (part) of him will share in the world of
heaven <span id="fr_718"></span>[5](#fn_706.md).

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:4:5">10:4:4:5</span></span>5. It
is regarding this that it is said in the *Ri*k (I, 179, 3), 'Not in vain
is the labour which the gods favour;' for, in truth, for him who knows
there is no labouring in vain, and so, indeed, the gods favour this
every (action) of his <span id="fr_719"></span>[1](#fn_707.md).
