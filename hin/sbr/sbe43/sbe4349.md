### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:5:1">10:1:5:1</span></span>1. This
built fire-altar, in truth, (includes) all these sacrifices:--when he
slaughters an animal victim, that is the Agnyâdheya (establishment of
the sacred fires) <span id="fr_554"></span>[1](#fn_545.md); when he
collects (the materials for) the fire-pan, that constitutes the
oblations of the Agnyâdheya; when he performs the initiation,

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

that is the Agnihotra; and when the initiated puts two logs on (the
fire) <span id="fr_555"></span>[1](#fn_546.md), these are the two oblations
of the Agnihotra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:5:2">10:1:5:2</span></span>2. He
puts them on in the evening and in the morning, for in the evening and
in the morning the Agnihotra oblations are offered;--with one and the
same formula, for with one and the same formula the two Agnihotra
oblations are offered <span id="fr_556"></span>[2](#fn_547.md). Then the
driving about (of the fire in the pan <span
id="fr_557"></span>[3](#fn_548)), and the taking down (to the water.md) of
the ashes, these two (constitute) the New and Full-moon offerings; and
when he builds the Gârhapatya hearth <span
id="fr_558"></span>[4](#fn_549.md), that is the *K*âturmâsya (seasonal
offerings); and what takes place from (the building of) the Gârhapatya
up to the (sowing of) all-herb (seed <span
id="fr_559"></span>[5](#fn_550), that constitutes.md) the ish*t*is <span
id="fr_560"></span>[6](#fn_551.md), and what takes place after the all-herb
(sowing) and prior to (the building

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

of) the layers, that is the animal sacrifices <span
id="fr_561"></span>[1](#fn_552.md); and the Vish*n*u-strides <span
id="fr_562"></span>[2](#fn_553) which are (performed.md) at these
sacrifices are just these Vish*n*u-strides; and what muttering of
formulas there is that is the Vâtsapra <span
id="fr_563"></span>[3](#fn_554.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:5:3">10:1:5:3</span></span>3. The
first layer is the Soma-sacrifice; the second the Râ*g*asûya as prior to
the consecrations <span id="fr_564"></span>[4](#fn_555.md); the third the
Vâ*g*apeya; the fourth the A*s*vamedha (horse-sacrifice); and the fifth
the Agnisava <span id="fr_565"></span>[5](#fn_556.md). Then the sâmans he
sings around the built (altar) are the Mahâvrata(-sâman); the
Udgât*ri*'s preliminary muttering (of the text of his chants) on that
occasion is the *S*atarudriya; the 'shower of wealth' the Great Litany;
and what takes place subsequent to (the singing of) the sâmans, and
prior to the shower of wealth, that is the Hot*ri*'s preliminary
muttering on that occasion; and what takes place after the shower of
wealth is the G*ri*hamedhas <span id="fr_566"></span>[6](#fn_557.md)
(house-sacrifices). Such are all the sacrifices: these he secures by
(building) the fire-altar.

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:5:4">10:1:5:4</span></span>4. Now,
then, as to the powers (conferred by the performance) of sacrifices.
Verily, he who (regularly) performs the Agnihotra eats food in the
evening and in the morning (when he comes to be) in yonder world, for so
much sustenance is there in that sacrifice. And he who performs the New
and Full-moon sacrifice (eats food) every half-month; and he who
performs the Seasonal sacrifice (does so) every four months; and be who
performs the animal sacrifice (twice a year, eats food) every six
months; and the Soma-sacrificer once a year; and the builder of the
fire-altar at his pleasure eats food every hundred years, or abstains
therefrom <span id="fr_567"></span>[1](#fn_558.md); for a hundred years is
as much as immortality <span id="fr_568"></span>[2](#fn_559.md), unending
and everlasting: and, verily, for him who knows this, there shall thus
be immortality, unending and everlasting; and whatever he as much as
touches, as it were, with a reed, shall be for him immortal, unending
and everlasting.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_545"></span>[296:1](sbe4349.htm#fr_554.md) Though no animal
sacrifice takes place at the Agnyâdhâna, the latter, as the fundamental
ceremony pre-supposed by all subsequent sacrificial performances, is
here compared with the immolation of five victims (VI, 2, 1, 15 seq.)
which, taking place as it does on the Upasavatha, or day of preparation,
i.e. the day before the Soma-sacrifice on the newly built fire-altar,
is, as it were, a preliminary ceremony.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[297:1](sbe4349.htm#fr_555.md) This refers to the
two samidhs (kindling-sticks) put on the Ukhya Agni,--one in the
evening, and one in the morning,--after the ashes had been cleared out
of the fire-pan (ukhâ); see VI, 6, 4, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[297:2](sbe4349.htm#fr_556.md) Both in the evening
and in the morning two libations of milk are offered (the pûrvâhuti and
the uttarâhuti), but only the first is offered with a formula, the
evening formula being, 'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, hail!'
whilst the morning formula is, 'Sûrya is the light, the light is Sûrya,
hail!' See II, 3, 1, 30. For alternative formulas--'With the divine
Savit*ri*, with the Night (or Dawn, respectively) wedded to Indra, may
Agni (or Indra, respectively) graciously accept, hail!' see II, 3, 1,
37. 38.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[297:3](sbe4349.htm#fr_557.md) See VI, 8, 1, 1
seq. Sâya*n*a takes it to refer to the Agnipra*n*ayana, or leading
forward of the fire to the fire-altar; but that would not fit in well
with the ceremony next referred to, viz. the removal of the fishes of
the Ukhyâgni, or fire in the pan; for which see VI, 8, 2, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[297:4](sbe4349.htm#fr_558.md) VII, 1, 1, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[297:5](sbe4349.htm#fr_559.md) Viz. on the newly
ploughed altar-site, see VII, 2, 4, 13 seq.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[297:6](sbe4349.htm#fr_560.md) That is, offerings
for the fulfilment of some special wishes.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[298:1](sbe4349.htm#fr_561.md) That is, animal
sacrifices performed independently of other ceremonies.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[298:2](sbe4349.htm#fr_562.md) See VI, 7, 2, 12
seq.

<span id="fn_554"></span>[298:3](sbe4349.htm#fr_563.md) See VI, 7, 4, 1
seq.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[298:4](sbe4349.htm#fr_564.md) That is, the
ceremonies connected with the Vâ*g*aprasavîya oblations, V, 2, 2, 4
seq.; and the devasû-havî*m*shi, or oblations to the Divine Quickeners
(by whom the king is supposed to be first consecrated), V, 3, 3, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_556"></span>[298:5](sbe4349.htm#fr_565.md) See [IX, 3, 4, 7.
9](sbe4338.htm#9:3:4:9.md). It is strange that the Agnisava should be
mentioned here, as it is said to be confined to the Agni*k*ayana. It
would seem that some independent ceremony, such as the B*ri*haspatisava
(consecration of B*ri*haspati, cf. V, 2, 1, 19; and part iii, introd. p.
xxiv seq.), may he referred to.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[298:6](sbe4349.htm#fr_566.md) Sâya*n*a identifies
these with the offerings of sacrificial sessions (sattra), during which
the Sacrificer is indeed called the G*ri*hapati, or master of the house;
see IV, 6, 3, 5 seq.; and part ii, p. 97, note 1.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[299:1](sbe4349.htm#fr_567.md) That is to say, the
food eaten the first time will sustain him for a hundred years, after
which time he may, or may not, take food, being sure of everlasting life
and a godlike nature.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[299:2](sbe4349.htm#fr_568.md) Or, perhaps, for so
long lasts the Amrita (the food of the immortals);--agni*m* *k*itavân
purushas tu *s*atasa*m*khyâkeshu sa*m*vatsareshu teshu kâmam aparimitam
a*s*nâti yato yâvanta*h* *s*ata*m* sa*m*vatsarâs tâvad am*ri*tam
devatvaprâpakam anantam aparimitam annum bhavati. Sây.
