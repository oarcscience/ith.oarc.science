### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:3:1">10:6:3:1</span></span>1. Let
him meditate upon the 'true Brahman.' Now, man here, indeed, is
possessed of understanding <span id="fr_824"></span>[1](#fn_811.md), and
according to how great his understanding is when he departs this world,
so does he, on passing away, enter yonder world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:3:2">10:6:3:2</span></span>2. Let
him meditate on the Self, which is made up of intelligence, and endowed
with a body of spirit, with a form of light, and with an etherial
nature, which changes its shape at will, is swift as thought, of true
resolve, and true purpose, which consists of all sweet odours and
tastes, which holds sway over all the regions and pervades this whole
universe, which is speechless and indifferent <span
id="fr_825"></span>[2](#fn_812.md);even as a grain of rice, or a grain of
barley, or a grain of millet, or the smallest granule of millet, so is
this golden <span id="fr_826"></span>[3](#fn_813.md) Purusha in the heart;
even as a smokeless light, it is greater than the sky, greater than the
ether, greater than the earth, greater than all existing things;--that
self of the spirit (breath) is my self: on passing away from hence I
shall obtain that self. Verily, whosoever has this trust <span
id="fr_827"></span>[4](#fn_814.md), for him there is no uncertainty. Thus
spake Sâ*nd*ilya, and so it is <span id="fr_828"></span>[5](#fn_815.md).

brilliance of gold (suvar*n*asamânate*g*â*h*). Sây.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[400:4](sbe4373.htm#fr_827.md) Or, thought,
knowledge (buddhi*h*), as Sâya*n*a supplies.

<span id="fn_815"></span>[400:5](sbe4373.htm#fr_828.md) Sâya*n*a takes this
along with 'so spake Sâ*nd*ilya,'--ity evam etad âha sma uktavân
*s*â*nd*ilyo nâmarshir iti. The final 'iti' seems to be intended to
indicate that *S*â*nd*ilya's opinion is adopted by the Brâhma*n*a.
