<P><A NAME="fn_50"></A><A HREF="sbe4304.htm#fr_50">8:2</A> No explanation of this s&acirc;man has been found anywhere. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, on the corresponding formula, Taitt. S. IV, 3, 4, 2 (where the term is spelt <I>ri</I>kshama), merely remarks that it is a kind of s&acirc;man.' The meaning of the term 'similar to a <I>ri</I><I>k</I>' would seem to indicate a hymn-tune involving little, or no, modification of the text chanted to it. At V, 4, 1, 5 it is the Vair&ucirc;pa-s&acirc;man which (together with the <I>G</I>agat&icirc;, the Saptada<I>s</I>a-stoma, the rainy season, and the Vi<I>s</I>) is in this way connected with the West. Now the textual parts of the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>anidhana<I>m</I> Vair&ucirc;pam (S&acirc;ma-v., vol. v, pp. 387, 575-6), ordinarily used as a p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-s&acirc;man, show <A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A> hardly any modifications on the original verses (S&acirc;ma-v., vol. ii, p. 278), even less so indeed than the simple Vair&ucirc;pa-s&acirc;man (<A HREF="errata.htm#0">S&acirc;ma</A>-v., vol. i, p. 572), and possibly '<I>ri</I>ksama' (if it does not apply to a whole class of s&acirc;mans) may be another name for the Vair&ucirc;pa (of which there are two other forms, S&acirc;ma-v., vol. i, pp. 425, 438) in its simplest form. The Vair&ucirc;pa, in its p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a form, would in that case, indeed, have originated from the <I>Ri</I>ksama-s&acirc;man. It is true, however, that there is no special connection between the other P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-s&acirc;mans and the respective hymn-tune with which they are symbolically connected in the foregoing formulas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_51"></A><A HREF="sbe4304.htm#fr_51">10:1</A> Ai<I>d</I>a-s&acirc;mans are those s&acirc;mans which have the word 'i<I>d</I>&acirc;' for their nidhana, or chorus. Such s&acirc;mans are, e<I>g</I>. the Vair&ucirc;pa (S&acirc;ma-v., vol. V, p. 387) and the Raurava (iii, 83), the latter of which forms the central s&acirc;man of the M&acirc;dhyandina-pavam&acirc;na-stotra. What connection there can be between the Ai<I>d</I>a and the Vair&acirc;<I>g</I>a-p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a (S&acirc;ma-v., vol. v, p. 391; cf. vol. i, pp. 814-5) it is not easy to see. In <I>S</I>at. Br. V, 4,i, 6 the North is connected with the Anush<I>t</I>ubh, the Vair&acirc;<I>g</I>a-s&acirc;man, the Ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a and the autumn.</P>
