<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:5:4:1">8:5:4:1</A></FONT></span>1. He lays them down on the range of the Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>&acirc;; for the Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>&acirc; is speech, and this (set of bricks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>) is the essence (of food): he thus lays into speech the essence of food; whence it is through (the channel of) speech that one distinguishes the essence of food for all the limbs.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:5:4:2">8:5:4:2</A></FONT></span>2. And, again, as to why (on the range) of the Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>&acirc;;--the Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>&acirc;, doubtless, is this (earth), and the Stomabh&acirc;g&acirc;s are yonder sun: he thus establishes yonder sun upon this earth as a firm foundation.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:5:4:3">8:5:4:3</A></FONT></span>3. And, again, why (on that) of the Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>&acirc;;--the Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>&acirc;, doubtless, is this (earth), and the Stomabh&acirc;g&acirc;s are the heart: he thus lays into this (earth) the heart, the mind: whence on this (earth) one thinks with the heart, with the mind. He lays them down on every side: he thus places the heart, the mind everywhere; whence everywhere on this (earth) one thinks with the heart, with the mind. And, moreover, these (bricks) are lucky signs: he places them on all sides; whence they say of him who has a (lucky) sign (lakshman) on every (or any) side that he has good luck (pu<I>n</I>yalakshm&icirc;ka).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:5:4:4">8:5:4:4</A></FONT></span>4. He then covers them with loose soil; for loose soil (pur&icirc;sha) means food, and this (set of bricks) is the essence (of food): he thus makes it invisible, for invisible, as it were, is the essence of food.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:5:4:5">8:5:4:5</A></FONT></span>5. And, again, as to why (he covers it) with loose</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A></p>  
<p>soil;--loose soil, doubtless, means food, and this (set of bricks) is the essence: he thus joins and unites the food and its essence.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:5:4:6">8:5:4:6</A></FONT></span>6. And, again, as to why with loose soil;--the Stomabh&acirc;g&acirc;s are the heart, and the loose soil is the pericardium: he thus encloses the heart in the pericardium.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:5:4:7">8:5:4:7</A></FONT></span>7. And, again, as to why with loose soil;--this fire-altar is the year, and by means of the soil-coverings of the layers he divides it: those first four layers are four seasons. And having laid down the Stomabh&acirc;g&acirc;s, he throws loose soil thereon: that is the fifth layer, that is the fifth season.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:5:4:8">8:5:4:8</A></FONT></span>8. Here now they say, 'Since the other layers conclude with Lokamp<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;s (space-filling bricks), and no space-filler is laid down in this (layer): what, then, is the space-filler therein?' The space-filler, surely, is yonder sun, and this layer is he; and this is of itself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_180"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> a space-filling layer. And what there is above this (layer) up to the covering of soil that is the sixth layer, that is the sixth season.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:5:4:9">8:5:4:9</A></FONT></span>9. He then throws down the loose soil. Thereon he lays down the Vikar<I>n</I>&icirc; and the naturally-perforated (brick); he bestrews them with chips of gold, and places the fire thereon: that is the seventh layer, that is the seventh season.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:5:4:10">8:5:4:10</A></FONT></span>10. But, indeed, there are only six of them; for as to the Vikar<I>n</I>&icirc; and the Svayam-&acirc;t<I>ri</I><I>n</I><I>n</I>&acirc;, they belong to the sixth layer.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:5:4:11">8:5:4:11</A></FONT></span>11. And, indeed, there are only five of them,--on the other (layers) he throws down the loose soil with a prayer, and here (he does so) silently: in that</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_97"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 97</FONT></A></p>  
<p>respect this is not a layer. And the other layers end with space-fillers, but here he lays down no space-filler: in that respect also this is not a layer.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:5:4:12">8:5:4:12</A></FONT></span>12. And, indeed, there are only three of them,--the first layer is this very (terrestrial) world; and the uppermost (layer) is the sky; and those three (intermediate layers) are the air, for there is, as it were, only one air here: thus (there are) three, or five, or six, or seven of them.</p>
