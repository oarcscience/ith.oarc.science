#### THE SECOND LAYER.

### SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:1">8:2:1:1</span></span>1. He
lays down the second layer. For now the gods, having laid down the first
layer, mounted it.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But, indeed, the
first layer is this (terrestrial) world: it is this same world which,
when completed, they mounted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:2">8:2:1:2</span></span>2. They
spake, 'Meditate ye!'--whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a
layer! Seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!' Whilst meditating, they
saw this second layer: what there is above the earth, and on this side
of the atmosphere, that world was to their mind, as it were, unfirm and
unsettled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:3">8:2:1:3</span></span>3. They
said to the A*s*vins, 'Ye two are Brahmans and physicians: lay ye down
for us this second layer!'--'What will therefrom accrue unto us?--'Ye
two shall be the Adhvaryus at this our Agni*k*ityâ.'--'So be it!'--The
A*s*vins laid down for them that second layer: whence they say, 'The
A*s*vins are the Adhvaryus of the gods.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:4">8:2:1:4</span></span>4. He
lays down (the first Â*s*vinî <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_76) brick,
with

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 1),
'Thou art firmly-founded, firmly-seated, firm!' for what is steady and
settled, that is firm. Now that world was to their minds, as it were,
unfirm and unsettled: having thereby made it firm, steady, they (the
A*s*vins) went on laying down (bricks).--'Seat thee fitly in thy firm
seat!'--that is, 'Seat thee fitly in thy steady seat;'--'enjoying the
first appearance of the Ukhya,'--the Ukhya, doubtless, is this Agni; and
that first layer is indeed his first appearance: thus, 'enjoying
that.'--'May the A*s*vins, the Adhvaryus, settle you here!' for the
A*s*vins, as Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:5">8:2:1:5</span></span>5. \[The
second Â*s*vinî he lays down, with Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 2\], 'Nest-like, fat,
wise,'--a nest, as it were, is indeed the second layer <span
id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_77);--'seat thee in the soft seat of the
earth!'--the second layer, no doubt, is the earth: thus, 'Sit on her
pleasant seat!'--'May the Rudras, the Vasus sing thy praises!'--that is,
'May those deities sing thy praises!'--'Replenish them, O Brahman, for
happiness!'--that is, 'Favour them, O Brahman, with a view to
happiness.'--'May the A*s*vins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!' for
the A*s*vins, as Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:6">8:2:1:6</span></span>6. \[The
third Â*s*vinî brick he lays down, with Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 3\], 'By thine
own powers seat thee here, a holder of powers,'--that is, 'By thy own
energy seat thee here;'--'in the gods’ favour for high joy!' that is,
'for the favour of the gods, for great joy <span
id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_78);"--'be thou kind, as a father to his
son!'--that is, 'As a father is gentle, kind, to his son, so be thou
kind!'--'rest thou readily accessible with thy form!'--the form,
doubtless, is the body: thus, 'rest thou with readily accessible
body!'--'May the A*s*vins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!' for the
A*s*vins, as Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:7">8:2:1:7</span></span>7. \[The
fourth Â*s*vinî he lays down, with Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 4\], 'Thou art the
earth's soil-cover,'--the first layer, doubtless, is the earth, and
this, the second (layer) is, as it were, its soil-cover (purîsha)--'her
sap <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_79), in truth,'--that is, 'her
essence, in truth,'--'May the All-gods sing thy praises!'--that is, 'May
all the gods sing thy praises!'--'Seat thee here, laden with stomas, and
rich in fat!'--whatever hymn-forms he will be spreading (constructing)
thereon by them this (brick) is laden with stomas <span
id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_80);--'Gain for us by sacrifice wealth
(dravi*n*â, pl.) with offspring (adj. sing.)!'--that is, 'Gain for us,
by sacrifice, wealth (dravi*n*am, sing.) with offspring!'--'May the
A*s*vins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!' for the A*s*vins, as
Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:8">8:2:1:8</span></span>8. These
(bricks) are those regions (quarters); he places them on the range of
the two reta*h*si*k* (bricks), for the reta*h*si*k* are these two
(worlds): he thereby places the regions within these two (worlds),
whence there are regions within these two (worlds). He lays down (these
bricks) in every direction: he thus places the regions in all (the four)
directions, whence the regions are in all directions. \[He places them\]
on all sides so as to face each other <span
id="fr_82"></span>[3](#fn_81): he thereby

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

makes the regions on all sides face each other, and hence the regions on
all sides face each other. He lays (the bricks) down separately, settles
them separately, and pronounces the sûdadohas over them separately, for
separate are the regions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:9">8:2:1:9</span></span>9. He
then lays down the fifth regional (or Â*s*vinî brick). Now that region
is the one above <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_82); and that same
region above, doubtless, is yonder sun: it is yonder sun he thus places
thereon. He places this (brick) within the southern regional one <span
id="fr_84"></span>[2](#fn_83): he thus places yonder sun within the
southern region, and therefore he moves within the southern region.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:10">8:2:1:10</span></span>10.
\[He lays it down, with Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 5\], 'I settle thee upon the back
of Aditi,'--Aditi doubtless is this (earth): it is upon her, as a
foundation, that he thus founds him (Agni);--'the holder

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

of the air, the supporter of the regions, the ruler of beings,'--for he
(the sun) is indeed the holder of the air, the supporter of the regions,
and the ruler of beings;--'thou art the wave, the drop, of water,'--the
wave, doubtless, means the essence;--'Vi*s*vakarman is thy
*Ri*shi!'--Vi*s*vakarman (the all-shaper), doubtless, is Pra*g*âpati:
thus, 'Thou art fashioned by Pra*g*âpati.'--'May the A*s*vins, the
Adhvaryus, settle thee here!' for the A*s*vins, as Adhvaryus, did lay
down (this brick).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:11">8:2:1:11</span></span>11. Now
as to why he lays down these Â*s*vinî (bricks). When Pra*g*âpati had
become relaxed (disjointed), the deities took him and went away in
different directions. Now what part of him there was above the feet and
below the waist, that part of him the two A*s*vins took and kept going
away from him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:12">8:2:1:12</span></span>12. He
said to them, 'Come to me and restore unto me that wherewith ye have
gone away from me!'--'What will accrue to us therefrom?'--'That part of
my body shall be sacred unto you!'--'So be it!' so the A*s*vins restored
that (part) unto him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:13">8:2:1:13</span></span>13. Now
these five Â*s*vinî (bricks) are that same (part) of his (Agni's) body;
and when he now puts them into this (layer of the altar), he thereby
restores to him what (part) of his body these (bricks) are: that is why
he puts them into this (layer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:14">8:2:1:14</span></span>14.
'Thou art firmly founded, firmly seated, firm,' he says, for whatsoever
is steady and established that is firm. Now that part of his
(Pra*g*âpati-Agni's) body was, as it were, unsteady, unfirm; and having
made it steady and firm they (the A*s*vins) restored it to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:15">8:2:1:15</span></span>15.
'Nestlike, fat, wise,' he says, for this indeed

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

is as a nest for his body.--'By thine own powers seat thee here, a
holder of powers,' he says, for they did make that (part) of him
powerful.--'Thou art the Earth's soil-cover,' he says, for that (lower
part) of his body is, as it were, in connection with the soil-cover. At
the range of the Reta*h*si*k* (he places the bricks),--the Reta*h*si*k*
are the ribs, for level with the ribs, as it were, is that (part) of his
body. He places them on every side, for on every side the A*s*vins
restored that (part) of his (Pra*g*âpati's) body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:16">8:2:1:16</span></span>16. He
then lays down two Ritavyâ <span id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_84) (seasonal
bricks);--these two, the *Ri*tavyâ, are the seasons (*ri*tu): it is the
seasons he thus bestows thereon. \[He lays them down, with Vâ*g*. S.
XIV, 6\], '*S*ukra and *S*u*k*i, the two summer-seasons;'--these are the
names of these two: it is with their names that he thus lays them down.
There are two bricks, for a season consists of two months. He settles
them once only: he thereby makes (the two months) one season.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:17">8:2:1:17</span></span>17. And
as to why he lays down these two in this (layer):--this Agni
(fire-altar) is the year, and the year is these worlds. Now that part of
him which is above the earth and below the atmosphere, is this second
layer; and that same part of him (Agni, the year,) is the summer season.
And when he lays down those two in this (layer), he thereby restores to
him (Agni) that part of his body which these two are: this is why he
lays down these two (bricks) in this (layer).

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:1:18">8:2:1:18</span></span>18.
And, again, as to why he lays down these two in this (layer). This
fire-altar is Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati is the year. Now that (part)
of him which is above the feet and below the waist is this second layer;
and that same part of him is the summer season. Thus when he lays down
those two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him that (part) of his
body which these two ale: this is why he lays down these two (bricks) in
this (layer).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_73"></span>[22:1](sbe4306.htm#fr_74) Viz. in the south-east
corner, or on the right shoulder, of the altar. From these two
lokamp*rin*âs (or space-fillers) he starts filling up, in two turns, the
still available spaces of the 'body' of the altar, as also the whole of
the two wings and the tail. For other particulars as to the way in which
these are laid down, see [VIII, 7, 2, 1](sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:1) seqq. The
'body' of an ordinary altar requires in this layer 1028 lokamp*rin*âs of
three different kinds, viz. a foot (Ind.), half a foot, and a quarter of
a foot square, occupying together a space of 321 square feet, whilst the
98 special (ya*g*ushmatî) bricks fill up a space of 79 square feet. Each
wing requires 309 lokamp*rin*âs of together 120 square feet; whilst the
tail takes 283 such bricks, of together 110 square feet. The total
number of lokamp*rin*âs in the layer thus amounts to 7929 of all sizes,
equal to 671 square feet. If (as is done in Kâty. *S*rautas. XVII, 7,
21) the 21 bricks of the Gârhapatya (part iii, p. 304) are added to this
number, the total number of lokamp*rin*âs is 1,950. Similarly, in the
second, third, and fourth layers; whilst the last layer requires about a
thousand lokamp*rin*âs more than any of the others, viz. 2,922, or,
including the special hearths, 3,000. The total number of such bricks
required--including the 21 of the Gârhapatya--amounts to 10,800. Cp.
Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 255.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[22:2](sbe4306.htm#fr_75) See [VIII, 7, 2,
1](sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:1) seq.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[22:3](sbe4306.htm#fr_76) See [VIII, 7, 3,
1](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:1) seq.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[23:1](sbe4307.htm#fr_77) The main portion of
the special bricks of the second layer consists of five, or (if, for the
nonce, we take the two southern sets of half-bricks as one) of four sets
of four bricks each, or of together sixteen bricks, each measuring a
foot square, placed on the range of the reta*h*si*k* bricks so as to
form the outer rim of a square measuring five feet on each side, and
having in the middle a blank square of nine square feet. Each of the
four sides of the reta*h*si*k* rim contains a complete set of four
bricks; but as there are five bricks on each side, the one in the
left-hand corner (looking at them from the centre of the square) is
counted along with the adjoining set. Each set, proceeding from left to
right (that is, in sunwise fashion), consists of the following
bricks,--â*s*vinî, vai*s*vadevî, prâ*n*abh*ri*t, and apasyâ, the last of
these occupying the corner spaces. The southern bricks consist, however,
of two sets of half-bricks (running with their long sides from west to
east), counted as the second and fifth set respectively. The eastern and
western bricks are laid down so that their line-marks (which, in the
case of the bricks of the second and fourth layers, are of an indefinite
number) run from west to east; whilst those of the southern <span
id="page_24">p. 24</span> and northern ones run from south to north. All
the five bricks of each class, beginning with the â*s*vinîs, are laid
down at the same time, proceeding again in sunwise fashion (east, south,
&c.); the

<span id="img_02400"></span> ![THE CENTRAL PART OF THE SECOND
LAYER.](img/02400.jpg)  
THE CENTRAL PART OF THE SECOND LAYER.

order of the procedure being only interrupted by the two Ritavyâ bricks
being laid down, immediately after the placing of the five â*s*vinî,
exactly over the two *ri*tavyâs of the first layer, that is to say in
the fifth (easterly) space from the centre, north and south of the
spine. The only other special bricks of the second layer are nineteen
vayasyâs placed at the four ends of the two spines, viz. four in the
east, and five in each of the other quarters.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[25:1](sbe4307.htm#fr_78) This comparison
doubtless refers to the way in which the central portion of the special
bricks of this layer are arranged so as completely to enclose an empty
space in the middle.. In the first layer there was, no doubt, a similar
enclosure of bricks as the reta*h*si*k* range, but the central space was
not left quite empty. In the end, however, the empty spaces are in both
cases filled up by 'space-fillers.'

<span id="fn_78"></span>[25:2](sbe4307.htm#fr_79) The author seems to
take 'rasa' as an adjective (= rama*n*îya), as does Mahîdhara, who
interprets the formula as meaning 'for the gods’ great, cheerful
happiness.'

<span id="fn_79"></span>[26:1](sbe4307.htm#fr_80) The word 'apsas,'
which western philologists usually take to mean 'cheek,' is here
apparently connected with 'ap,' water.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[26:2](sbe4307.htm#fr_81) Literally, 'having
stomas on her back.' Mahîdhara interprets 'stoma-p*ri*sh*th*â' by
'possessed of stomas and P*ri*sh*th*as.' Sâya*n*a, on Taitt. S. III, 7,
2, 7, by '(P*ri*sh*th*a-)stotras performed with stomas.'

<span id="fn_81"></span>[26:3](sbe4307.htm#fr_82) 'Samya*ñk*' may either
mean 'tending to one and the same point,' or 'running in the same
direction, parallel to each other.' It is probably in the former sense
that we have to take it here, though not quite literally, but in so far
as the line-marks of these <span id="page_27">p. 27</span> bricks, if
continued towards the centre of the altar, intersect one another. As
applied to the quarters this meaning would then modify itself to that of
'facing each other.' On the other hand, it is quite possible that the
meaning of 'tending in the same direction' is the one intended; and it
would in that case probably apply to the fact that the sets opposite to
each other have their line-marks running in the same direction, or are
parallel to each other; and this meaning would seem to be implied to the
quarters where the author supports his argument by the fact that the
wind blows, and the rain falls, in the same direction in all the four
quarters ([VIII, 2, 3, 2](sbe4309.htm#8:2:3:2);
[5](sbe4309.htm#8:2:3:5)). It is curious that the expression is used by
the author in connection with the â*s*vinî, prâ*n*abh*ri*t, and apasyâ,
but not with the vai*s*vadevî, the line-marks of which all meet in one
central point, which is not the case with the others. At [VIII, 3, 1,
11](sbe4311.htm#8:3:1:11), on the other hand, it is used again in
connection with the Di*s*yâ bricks, which, in the third layer, occupy
exactly the same spaces as the Vai*s*vadevîs do here.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[27:1](sbe4307.htm#fr_83) Or, that direction is
the one upward (from here).

<span id="fn_83"></span>[27:2](sbe4307.htm#fr_84) That is to say, he
places it immediately north of the southern â*s*vinî, so as to fill up
the unoccupied, inner half of the space (of a foot square).

<span id="fn_84"></span>[29:1](sbe4307.htm#fr_85) These two bricks are
placed exactly upon the two *Ri*tavyâs of the first layer, that is, in
the fifth space from the centre; see [p. 1](sbe4303.htm#page_1), note
[1](sbe4303.htm#fn_34).
