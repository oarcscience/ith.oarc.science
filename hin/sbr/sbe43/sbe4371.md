### SIXTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:1:1">10:6:1:1</span></span>1. Now
at the house of Aru*n*a Aupave*s*i <span id="fr_809"></span>[1](#fn_796)
these came once together,--Satyaya*gñ*a Paulushi, Mahâ*s*âla *G*âbâla,
Bu*d*ila Â*s*vatarâ*s*vi, Indradyumna Bhâllaveya, and
*G*ana*s*ârkarâkshya. They took counsel together regarding (Agni)
Vai*s*vânara, but did not agree as to Vai*s*vânara <span
id="fr_810"></span>[2](#fn_797).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:1:2">10:6:1:2</span></span>2. They
said, 'There is that A*s*vapati Kaikeya who knows Vai*s*vânara
thoroughly <span id="fr_811"></span>[3](#fn_798): let us go to him!'
They went to A*s*vapati Kaikeya. He ordered for them separate dwellings,
separate honours, separate Soma-sacrifices each with a thousand gifts.
In the morning, still at variance with one another, they

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

came again to him, with fuel in their hands <span
id="fr_812"></span>[1](#fn_799), saying, 'We want to become thy pupils.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:1:3">10:6:1:3</span></span>3. He
said, 'How is this, venerable sirs, when ye are learned in the
scriptures, and sons of men learned in the scriptures?' They replied,
'Venerable sir, thou knowest Vai*s*vânara thoroughly: teach us him!' He
said, 'I do indeed know Vai*s*vânara thoroughly: put your fuel on (the
fire), ye are become my pupils <span id="fr_813"></span>[2](#fn_800).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:1:4">10:6:1:4</span></span>4. He
then said to Aru*n*a Aupave*s*i, 'O Gautama, as whom knowest thou
Vai*s*vânara <span id="fr_814"></span>[3](#fn_801)?'--'As Earth only, O
king;' he replied.--'Yea,' he said, 'that indeed is Vai*s*vânara, the
foundation; and because thou knowest the Vai*s*vânara Foundation
(pratish*th*â) therefore thou art firmly established (pratish*th*ita)
with offspring and cattle; and, verily, he who knows that Vai*s*vânara
Foundation, repels Death and attains all life. But, in truth, these are
only the feet <span id="fr_815"></span>[4](#fn_802) of Vai*s*vânara, and
thy feet would have withered away, hadst thou not come hither; or the
feet would be unknown to thee, hadst thou not come hither <span
id="fr_816"></span>[5](#fn_803).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:1:5">10:6:1:5</span></span>5. He
then said to Satyaya*gñ*a Paulushi, 'O Prâ*k*înayogya, as whom knowest
thou Vai*s*vânara?'

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --'As Water only,
O king;' he replied.--'Yea,' he said, 'that indeed is the Vai*s*vânara
Wealth; and because thou knowest that Vai*s*vânara Wealth, therefore
thou art wealthy and prosperous; and, verily, he who knows that
Vai*s*vânara Wealth, repels death and attains all life. But, in truth,
this is only the bladder of Vai*s*vânara, and thy bladder would have
failed thee, hadst thou not come hither; or the bladder would be unknown
to thee, hadst thou not come hither.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:1:6">10:6:1:6</span></span>6. He
then said to Mahâ*s*âla *G*âbâla, 'O Aupamanyava, as whom knowest thou
Vai*s*vânara?'--'As Ether only, O king,' he replied.--'Yea,' he said,
'that, indeed, is the Vai*s*vânara Plenteous; and because thou knowest
Vai*s*vânara Plenteous, therefore thou art plentiful in offspring and
cattle; and, verily, he who knows that Vai*s*vânara Plenteous, repels
death and attains all life. But, in truth, this is only the trunk of
Vai*s*vânara, and thy trunk would have failed thee, hadst thou not come
hither; or the body would be unknown to thee, hadst thou not come
hither.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:1:7">10:6:1:7</span></span>7. He
then said to [Budila](errata.htm#7) Â*s*vatarâ*s*vi, 'O Vaiyâghrapadya,
as whom knowest thou Vai*s*vânara?'--'As Air (wind) only, O king;' he
replied.--'Yea,' he

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

said, 'that indeed is the Vai*s*vânara of divers courses; and because
thou knowest that Vai*s*vânara of divers courses, therefore divers rows
of cars follow thee; and, verily, he who knows that Vai*s*vânara of
divers courses, repels death, and attains all life. But, in truth, this
is only the breath of Vai*s*vânara, and thy breath would have failed
thee, hadst thou not come hither; or the breath would be unknown to
thee, hadst thou not come hither.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:1:8">10:6:1:8</span></span>8. He
then said to Indradyumna Bhâllaveya, 'O Vaiyâghrapadya, as whom knowest
thou Vai*s*vânara?'--'As Sun only, O king,' he replied.--'Yea,' he said,
'that indeed is the Vai*s*vânara of Soma's splendour <span
id="fr_817"></span>[1](#fn_804); and because thou knowest the
Vai*s*vânara of Soma's splendour, therefore that Soma-juice never fails
to be consumed and cooked <span id="fr_818"></span>[2](#fn_805) in thy
house; and, verily, he who knows that Vai*s*vânara of Soma's splendour,
repels death, and attains all life. But, indeed, this is only the eye of
Vai*s*vânara, and thine eye would have failed thee, hadst thou not come
hither; or the eye would be unknown to thee, hadst thou not come
hither.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:1:9">10:6:1:9</span></span>9. He
then said to *G*ana *S*arkarâkshya, 'O Sâyavasa, as whom knowest thou
Vai*s*vânara?'--'As Heaven only, O king,' he replied.--'Yea,' he said,
'that indeed is Vai*s*vânara Pre-eminence; and because thou knowest the
Vai*s*vânara Pre-eminence, therefore thou art pre-eminent among thine
equals; and, verily, he who knows that Vai*s*vânara Preeminence

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

repels death, and attains all life. But, indeed, this is only the head
of Vai*s*vânara, and thy head would have failed thee, hadst thou not
come hither; or the head would have been unknown to thee, hadst thou not
come hither.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:1:10">10:6:1:10</span></span>10.
He said to them, 'Ye then, knowing different Vai*s*vânaras, have been
feeding on different kinds of food; but verily, the well-beknown gods
have attained, as it were, the measure of a span <span
id="fr_819"></span>[1](#fn_806); but I will so tell them unto you that I
shall make them attain no more nor less than the measure of a span.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:1:11">10:6:1:11</span></span>11.
Pointing at the head he said, 'This, indeed, is the Vai*s*vânara
Pre-eminence;'--pointing at the eyes he said, 'This, indeed, is the
Vai*s*vânara of Soma's splendour;'--pointing at the nostrils he said,
'This, indeed, is the Vai*s*vânara of divers courses;'--pointing at the
space in the mouth he said, 'This, indeed, is the Vai*s*vânara
Plenteous;'--pointing at the water in the mouth he said, 'This, indeed,
is the Vai*s*vânara Wealth;'--pointing at the chin he said, 'This,
indeed, is the Vai*s*vânara Foundation.'

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This Agni
Vai*s*vânara is no other than the Purusha; and, verily, whosoever thus
knows that Agni Vai*s*vânara as Purusha-like, as established within the
Purusha, repels death, and attains all life; and, verily, Vai*s*vânara
does no harm to him that speaks of him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_796"></span>[393:1](sbe4371.htm#fr_809) *Kh*ândogyop. V,
11, where another version of this story occurs, has here the name of
Aru*n*a's son, Uddâlaka Âru*n*i; and, instead of Mahâ*s*âla *G*âbâla, it
has Prâ*k*îna*s*âla Aupamanya.

<span id="fn_797"></span>[393:2](sbe4371.htm#fr_810) Sâya*n*a takes this
to mean, 'he (Aru*n*a) was unable to instruct them in regard to
Vai*s*vânara,'--so<sup>ऽ</sup>ru*n*as teshâ*m* satyaya*gñ*âdînâ*m*
pa*ñk*ânâ*m* vai*s*vânaravidyâ*m* bodhayitu*m* na samiyâya sa*m*gata*h*
*s*akto nâbhavat,--probably, however, 'samiyâya' is better taken
impersonally ('there was no agreement between them'), as is done by the
St. Petersb. Dict.; though *Kh*ând. XI, 3 favours Sâya*n*a's view.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[393:3](sbe4371.htm#fr_811) Sâya*n*a takes
'samprati' in its ordinary sense of 'now.' The knowledge of Vai*s*vânara
implied here, according to Sâya*n*a, means the knowledge of the supreme
deity (parame*s*vara).

<span id="fn_799"></span>[394:1](sbe4371.htm#fr_812) That is, in the way
in which pupils approach their teacher.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[394:2](sbe4371.htm#fr_813) Literally, 'Ye have
entered (my tuition);' upetâ stha upâsînâ bhavatha. Sây.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[394:3](sbe4371.htm#fr_814) Or, perhaps, 'what
Vai*s*vânara knowest thou?'

<span id="fn_802"></span>[394:4](sbe4371.htm#fr_815) 'Pratish*th*â'
(rest, foundation) also commonly means 'the feet.'

<span id="fn_803"></span>[394:5](sbe4371.htm#fr_816) It is not quite
clear whether the words 'or the feet, &c.' really (as Sâya*n*a takes
them) form part of the king's speech, or whether they are merely meant
as explanatory of the latter part of the king's remarks. If Sâya*n*a be
right, the words 'the feet would be unknown by thee,' seem to admit of a
double meaning, viz. 'thou wouldst <span id="page_395">p. 395</span>
have become footless,' or 'not even Vai*s*vânara's feet would have been
known by thee;' though in the latter sense some particle such as 'eva'
might have been expected. Sâya*n*a, however, seems to take these words
in yet another sense (if, indeed, he had not another reading before
him),--vai*s*vânarasyâ*gñ*ânât pâdau te tava viparîtagrâhi*n*o
amlâsyatâm amlânau gamanâsamarthâv abhavishyatâ*m* yadi mâ*m*
nâgamishya*h*; ittha*m* doshaparyavasânayuktam ekade*s*a*gñ*ânam eva
nâva*s*esha ity âha, pâdau to viditâv iti vai*s*vânarasya pâdamâtra*m*
tvayâ vidita*m* na tu k*ri*tsno vai*s*vânara*h*; ata*h* sâdhv akârshîr
yat tvam âgato<sup>ऽ</sup>sîty abhiprâya*h*.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[396:1](sbe4371.htm#fr_817) Or, perhaps better,
'of Soma's fire.' The *Kh*ândogya-upanishad has 'Sute*g*as (of beautiful
splendour, or light),' instead of 'sutate*g*as.'

<span id="fn_805"></span>[396:2](sbe4371.htm#fr_818) According to
Sâya*n*a, this refers to the cooking, or baking, of the cakes
(puro*d*â*s*a) connected with the Soma-sacrifice.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[397:1](sbe4371.htm#fr_819) Sâya*n*a apparently
takes this thus: but the gods, knowing well that (essential element)
which is merely of the space of a span, have become successful;--yat tv
eva*m* yathoktâvayavai*h* p*ri*thivîpâdâdibhir dyumûrdhântair avayavair
vi*s*ish*t*am eka*m* vastu tat prâde*s*amâtra*m* prâde*s*apramâ*n*am iva
devâ*h* suvidita*h* samyag *gñ*âtavanto<sup>ऽ</sup>bhisampannâ*h*
prâptaphalâ babhûvur ity artha*h*. Though this interpretation looks very
plausible, the accent of 'súvidita' would scarcely admit of the word
being taken as a bahuvrîhi compound. In the words which follow, Sâya*n*a
takes 'them (enân)' to refer to the bodily parts of Vai*s*vânara,
identified with the imperfect doctrines of the king's disciples. It is,
indeed, quite possible that 'the gods' are here identified with the
special Vai*s*vânaras, the unity of whom, in the one Purusha, or Atman
(self), the Brâhma*n*a endeavours to inculcate.
