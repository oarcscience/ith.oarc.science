### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:5:1">10:5:5:1</span></span>1.
Ku*s*ri Vâ*g*a*s*ravasa <span id="fr_801"></span>[2](#fn_788.md) once built
a fire-altar. Su*s*ravas Kaushya then said to him, 'Gautama, when thou
wert just now building up Agni, didst thou build him with his face
forward, or backward, or downward, or upward?

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:5:2">10:5:5:2</span></span>2. 'If
perchance thou hast built him looking forward, it would be just as if
one were to offer food from behind to one sitting with averted
face <span id="fr_802"></span>[1](#fn_789.md): he thereby will not receive
thy offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:5:3">10:5:5:3</span></span>3. 'And
if thou hast built him looking backward, wherefore, then, hast thou made
him a tail behind?

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:5:4">10:5:5:4</span></span>4. 'And
if thou hast built him with his face downward, it would be just as if
one were to put food on the back of one lying with his face downward: he
surely will not receive thy offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:5:5">10:5:5:5</span></span>5. 'And
if thou hast built him with his face upward--surely, a bird does not fly
towards heaven with its face turned upward <span
id="fr_803"></span>[2](#fn_790.md): he will not carry thee to heaven, he
will not become conducive to heaven for thee.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:5:6">10:5:5:6</span></span>6. He
said, 'I have built him with his face forward; I have built him with his
face backward; I have built him with his face downward; I have built him
with his face upward: I have built him in all directions.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:5:7">10:5:5:7</span></span>7. When
he lays down the (gold) man with his head forward (eastward), and the
two spoons (with their bowls) forward <span
id="fr_804"></span>[3](#fn_791), thereby he (Agni.md) is built looking
forward; and when he lays down the

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

tortoise <span id="fr_805"></span>[1](#fn_792.md) with its head backward
(westward), and the victims’ heads turned backward, thereby he is built
looking backward; and when he, lays down the tortoise with its face
downward, and the victims’ heads with their faces downward, and the
bricks with their faces downward <span id="fr_806"></span>[2](#fn_793.md),
thereby he is built looking downward; and when he lays down the (gold)
man with his face upward, and the two spoons (with their open bowls)
turned upward, and the mortar turned upward, and the fire-pan turned
upward, thereby he is built looking upward; and when he lays down the
bricks whilst moving round (the altar) in every direction, thereby he is
built (looking) in all directions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:5:8">10:5:5:8</span></span>8. Now,
the Koshas, whilst driving about, once drove up <span
id="fr_807"></span>[3](#fn_794.md) to an Agni with his head pulled
out <span id="fr_808"></span>[4](#fn_795.md). One of them said, 'The head
(*s*iras) means excellence (*s*rî): he has pulled out his excellence, he
will be deprived of his all!' and so indeed it happened to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:5:9">10:5:5:9</span></span>9. And
another said, 'The head means the vital airs: he has pulled out his
vital airs, he will quickly go to yonder world!' and so, indeed, it
happened to him.

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:5:10">10:5:5:10</span></span>10.
Upwards, indeed, he (Agni) is built up, to wit, (in the shape of) the
grass-bunch, the clod-bricks, the lotus-leaf, the gold plate and man,
the two spoons, the naturally-perforated one, the grass-brick, the
Dviya*g*us, the two Reta*h*si*k*, the [Vi*s*va*g*yotis](errata.htm#6.md),
the two seasonal bricks, the Ashâ*dh*â, and the tortoise; and that fire
which is placed on the altar-pile, assuredly, is then most manifestly
his (Agni's) head: let him therefore not pull out (the head).

<span id="fn_788"></span>[390:2](sbe4370.htm#fr_801.md) That is, Ku*s*ri
Gautama, (son and) disciple of Vâ*g*a*s*ravas.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[391:1](sbe4370.htm#fr_802.md) The oblations are
offered by the Adhvaryu whilst standing south, or south-west, of the
fire, with his face turned towards northeast,--hence Agni, looking
eastwards, would not see the food offered him.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[391:2](sbe4370.htm#fr_803.md) Yady agnir

Sây. The broad side of the bricks not marked with lines is thus looked
upon as their face.

<span id="fn_794"></span>[392:3](sbe4370.htm#fr_807.md) That is to say,
according to Sâya*n*a, whilst going about officiating at sacrifices,
they built the altar in that way at some one's house.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[392:4](sbe4370.htm#fr_808.md) That is, with a
head built on to the altar on the front side of the body; see the
diagram of the *s*yena*k*iti in Burnell's Cat. of Vedic MSS. (1870), p.
29.
