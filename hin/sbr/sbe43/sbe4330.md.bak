# NINTH KÂ*ND*A.

##### THE BUILDING OF THE SACRED FIRE-ALTAR

##### (continued).

##### *S*ATARUDRIYA LUSTRATION, INSTALMENT AND CONSECRATION OF FIRE, AND SOMA-SACRIFICE.

### FIRST ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE SATARUDRIYA.

THIS solemn and awful ceremony consists of 425 oblations to Rudra, the
representative of the fearful aspects of life and nature, accompanied by
appropriate formulas addressed to the various forms of the terrible god,
and his associates, with a view to appeasing their wrath. These formulas
make up a complete kâ*nd*a (XVI) of the Vâ*g*asaneyi-sa*m*hitâ, and
constitute a special Upanishad. Though only a few of the formulas are
actually referred to in the text of the Brâhma*n*a, the different
portions of which this dismal litany consists are otherwise alluded to,
and for this reason, as well as on account of its intrinsic interest, as
doubtless reflecting, to a considerable extent, the popular belief in
demoniac agencies to which man is constantly exposed, a complete
translation of the *S*atarudriya formulas is here given. For a German
translation of the Taittirîya recension of the text, with the various
readings of the Kâ*th*aka and Vâ*g*asaneyin versions, see A. Weber, Ind.
Stud. II, p. 14 seqq.

I. 1. Reverence, O Rudra, be to thy wrath; and to thine arrow be
reverence; and to both thine arms be reverence! 2. What auspicious form
there is of thine, free from terror and boding of evil, with that most
propitious form look down upon us, O mountain-dweller! 3. The shaft thou
bearest in thy hand to hurl, O mountain-dweller, make it harmless, O
protector of mountains, injure not man nor beast! 4. With auspicious
speech we call upon thee, O mountain-dweller, that all these living
beings of ours may

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

be healthy and of good cheer! 5. May he plead for us as our intercessor,
the first divine physician: crushing all serpents, turn thou aside all
practices of witchcraft! 6. That tawny one, and the ruddy and the brown
one, the auspicious--the Rudras that hover around him by thousands in
the quarters: their wrath do we deprecate. 7. That one who glideth
downwards (the sun) blood-red and blue-necked--the cowherds have seen
him and the water-bearers (f. the clouds) have seen him--be he gracious
unto us, when seen! 8. Reverence be to the blue-necked, thousand-eyed
showerer; and what henchmen there are of his, to them do I render
homage. 9. Loose thou the string from the ends of thy bow; and cast away
the arrows in thy hand, O holy one! 10. Stringless be the bow of the
coil-braided one, and arrowless his quiver! may his arrows be futile,
axed empty his scabbard! 11. With that plague-repelling weapon in thy
hand, with thy bow, protect us, O best of showerers, on all sides! 12.
May the shaft of thy bow spare us on all sides, and far from us lay down
that quiver of thine! 13. Unstringing the bow, and breaking off the
points of thy shafts, be thou gracious and well-disposed unto us, O
thousand-eyed lord of a hundred quivers! 14. Reverence be to thine
unstrung weapon, the powerful one; and reverence be to thine arms and to
thy bow! 15. Neither our full-grown, nor our little one, neither the
virile, nor the unborn, neither our father strike thou, nor our mother:
harm not our dear bodies, O Rudra! 16. Neither to our children, and our
children's children, nor to our life, neither to our kine nor to our
horses do thou injury! smite not our shining warriors: with offering we
ever invoke thee, O Rudra!

IX\. 47. Chaser, lord of the (Soma) plant! blue-red cleaver! fright and
hurt not these people and these cattle: let none of us sicken! 48. These
prayers we bring before the mighty Rudra, the coil-braided miter of
heroes, that there may be safety for the two-footed and the four-footed,
and that everything in this village may be healthy and thriving. 49.
That friendly form of thine, O Rudra, friendly and ever healing,
friendly and healing to the stricken: therewith be gracious unto us that
we may live! 50. May the shaft of Rudra spare us, and the ill-will of
the violent and malevolent

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

one: unstring the strong (bow) from (hurting) our patrons, O showerer
(of gifts), and be gracious unto our children and our children's
children! 51. Be thou kindly *and* well-disposed towards us, O kindliest
chief of showerers, lay down thy weapon on the highest tree, and putting
on the hide come and join us, bearing the spear! 52. O blood-red
scatterer, reverence be unto thee, holy one, let those thousand shafts
of thine lay low another than us! 53. The thousandfold thousand shafts
of thine arms--turn thou away their heads from us, O holy lord! 54. What
countless thousands of Rudras there are upon earth, their bows do we
unstring (and cast away) at a thousand leagues. 55. The Bhavas in this
great sea, the air: their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 56.
The blue-necked, white-throated Rudras seated in the sky: their bows do
we unstring at a thousand leagues. 57. The blue-necked, white-throated
*S*arvas dwelling below the earth: their bows do we unstring at a
thousand leagues. 58. The grass-green in the trees, the blue-necked,

wielders of spear and sword: their bows do we unstring at a thousand
leagues. 62. They who strike men at their meals, and in their cups those
that drink: their bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues. 63. What
Rudras are scattered over the regions, so many and more: their bows do
we unstring at a thousand leagues.--64. Reverence be to the Rudras
dwelling in the sky, whose arrows the rain is! to them (I stretch) ten
(fingers) eastward, ten southward, ten westward, ten northward, ten
upward: to them be reverence! may they be gracious unto us and help us:
whomsoever we hate, and whosoever hateth us, him we cast into their
jaws! 65. Reverence be to the Rudras dwelling in the air, whose arrows
the wind is! to them (I stretch) ten (fingers) eastward, ten southward,
ten westward, ten northward, ten upward: to them be reverence! may they
be gracious unto us and help us: whomsoever we hate, and whosoever
hateth us, him we cast into their jaws! 66. Reverence be to the Rudras
dwelling upon earth, whose arrows food is! to them (I stretch) ten
(fingers) eastward, ten southward, ten westward, ten northward, ten
upward: to them be reverence! may they be gracious unto us and help us:
whomsoever we hate, and whosoever hateth us, him we cast into their
jaws!

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:1">9:1:1:1</span></span>1. He
then performs the *S*atarudriya offering! This whole Agni has now <span
id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_260.md) been completed: he now is the deity
Rudra. Upon him the gods bestowed that highest form, immortality.
Flaming he there stood longing for food. The gods were afraid of him
lest he should hurt them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:2">9:1:1:2</span></span>2. They
spake, 'Let us gather together food for him: therewith we will appease
him!' They gathered for him that food, the *S*ântadevatya <span
id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_261.md), and thereby appeased him; and inasmuch
as they thereby appeased (*s*am) the god (deva), it is called
*S*ântadevatya;--*S*ântadevatya, doubtless, is here called mystically
'*S*atarudriya <span id="fr_263"></span>[3](#fn_262.md),' for the gods love
the mystic. And in like manner does this Sacrificer now bestow upon him
that highest form, immortality. Flaming he there stands, longing for
food. He gathers for him that food, the *S*ântadevatya, and thereby
appeases him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:3">9:1:1:3</span></span>3. He
offers wild sesamum seeds. He (Agni) grows when he is being built up: he
grows for (the consumption) of every kind of food. And wild sesamum
seeds represent both kinds of food, the cultivated as well as the
wild-growing: inasmuch as they are sesamum seeds they are a cultivated
(kind of food), and inasmuch as they ripen on unploughed land they are
wild-growing; he thus satisfies him with both kinds of food, the
cultivated as well as the wild-growing.

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:4">9:1:1:4</span></span>4. He
offers by means of an arka-leaf <span
id="fr_264"></span>[1](#fn_263),--the Arka-tree (Calotropis gigantea.md) is
food: he thus gratifies him with food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:5">9:1:1:5</span></span>5. He
offers on (three) enclosing-stones:--these enclosing-stones are the
(three) Agnis; and thus it is over Agni himself that these oblations of
his become offered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:6">9:1:1:6</span></span>6. And as
to why he performs the *S*atarudriya offering. When Pra*g*âpati had
become disjointed, the deities departed from him. Only one god did not
leave him, to wit, Manyu (wrath): extended he remained within. He
(Pra*g*âpati) cried, and the tears of him that fell down settled on
Manyu. He became the hundred-headed, thousand-eyed, hundred-quivered
Rudra. And the other drops that fell down, spread over these worlds in
countless numbers, by thousands; and inasmuch as they originated from
crying (rud), they were called Rudras (roarers). That hundred-headed,
thousand-eyed, hundred-quivered Rudra, with his bow strung, and his
arrow fitted to the string, was inspiring fear, being in quest of food.
The gods were afraid of him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:7">9:1:1:7</span></span>7. They
spake unto Pra*g*âpati 'We are afraid of this one, lest he should hurt
us!' He spake, 'Gather food for him, and appease him therewith!' They
gathered for him that food, the *S*atarudriya (offering), and thereby
appeased him; and inasmuch as they thereby appeased (*s*am) the
hundred-headed (*s*ata*s*îrsha) Rudra, it is called
*S*ata*s*îrsharudra*s*amanîya,--and *s*ata*s*îrsharudra*s*amanîya,
doubtless, is what

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

they mystically call *S*atarudriya, for the gods love the mystic. And in
like manner does this (Sacrificer) now gather for him that food, the
*S*atarudriya, and appease him thereby.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:8">9:1:1:8</span></span>8. He
offers gavedhukâ flour; for from the place where that deity lay
disjointed, gavedhukâ plants (coix barbata) sprang forth: he thus
gratifies him by his own portion, by his own life-sap.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:9">9:1:1:9</span></span>9. He
offers by means of an arka-leaf; for that tree sprang from the
resting-place of that god: he thus gratifies him by his own portion, by
his own life-sap.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:10">9:1:1:10</span></span>10. He
offers on (three) enclosing-stones <span
id="fr_265"></span>[1](#fn_264.md), for the enclosing-stones are the hair,
and neither poison nor anything else injures one at the hair. He offers
whilst standing on the left (north) side of Agni (the altar), with his
face to the north; for in that region lies the house of that god <span
id="fr_266"></span>[2](#fn_265.md): it is thus in his own region that he
gratifies him, in his own region he contents him with offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:11">9:1:1:11</span></span>11. The
first Svâhâ ('hail') he utters on the knee-high one,---what is knee-high
is, as it were, below, and below, as it were, is this (terrestrial)
world: he thus gratifies those Rudras who entered this world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:12">9:1:1:12</span></span>12.
Then on the navel-high one,--what is navel-high

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

is, as it were, the middle; and the middle, as it were, is the
air-world: he thus gratifies those Rudras who entered the air-world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:13">9:1:1:13</span></span>13.
Then on the one reaching up to the mouth,--what reaches up to the mouth
is, as it were, above, and above, as it were, is yonder world: he thus
gratifies those Rudras who entered yonder world. \[He does so\] with
Svâhâ,--the Svâhâ is food: with food he thus gratifies them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:14">9:1:1:14</span></span>14.
\[He offers, with, Vâ*g*. S. XVI, 1\], 'Reverence, O Rudra, be to thy
wrath!' he thereby does reverence to that wrath which remained extended
within him;--'And to thine arrow be reverence, and to both thine arms be
reverence!' for it was by his arrow and his arms that he was inspiring
fear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:15">9:1:1:15</span></span>15.
That god who became the hundred-headed (Rudra) is the chief
(kshatra <span id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_266).md), and those others who
originated from the drops are the peasants (clansmen): those peasants in
the first place assigned to that chief this as his special share, to
wit, this first chapter of formulas <span
id="fr_268"></span>[2](#fn_267.md), and gratified him thereby. And in like
manner does this (Sacrificer) now assign this to him as his special
fore-share, and gratify him thereby. Hence this (section) is addressed
to a single deity, to Rudra; for it is him he thereby gratifies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:16">9:1:1:16</span></span>16.
There are here fourteen formulas,--thirteen months are a year, and
Pra*g*âpati is the fourteenth;

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

and Pra*g*âpati is Agni: as great as Agni is as great as is his measure,
with so much food he thus gratifies him. 'Reverence! reverence!' he
says;--reverence being sacrifice, it is by sacrifice, by reverence, that
he thus reveres him. Therefore he must not mention any one unworthy of
sacrifice, for it would be just as if he were to say to him, 'Sacrifice
be to thee!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:17">9:1:1:17</span></span>17. He
then makes offering to those forming pairs <span
id="fr_269"></span>[1](#fn_268.md): 'Reverence to so and so! reverence to
so and so!' It is as if he were to say, 'Thou, N. N., and this one, do
not ye two injure us!' for in no wise does a man who is known and
appealed to <span id="fr_270"></span>[2](#fn_269.md) injure us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:18">9:1:1:18</span></span>18.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XVI, 17\], 'Reverence be to the golden-armed leader of
hosts, and to the lord of regions be reverence!' for he (Rudra-Agni) is
indeed the golden-armed <span id="fr_271"></span>[3](#fn_270.md) leader of
hosts, and the lord of regions. And in that everything in this second
chapter of formulas applies to one and the same deity, thereby he
gratifies that (god Rudra), and makes the chief to have a share in the
people (or the clan): hence whatever belongs to the people <span
id="fr_272"></span>[4](#fn_271.md), in that the chieftain has a share. And
those (Rudras) that spread over these worlds, countless, by
thousands <span id="fr_273"></span>[5](#fn_272.md), they are the deities to
whom he now offers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:19">9:1:1:19</span></span>19. He
thus makes offering to the tribes (of Rudras), for it was those tribes,
those Rudras, that spread, and wheresoever they are there he thereby
gratifies them. And thus, indeed, (he gratifies) those tribes of Rudras;
and, men being after the

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

manner of the gods, therefore also these tribes of men: tribe after
tribe he thus gratifies them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:20">9:1:1:20</span></span>20. Now
some of these (formulas) have 'reverence' on both sides, and others on
one side only;--more terrible and more unappeased, indeed, are those
(Rudras) that have 'reverence' on both sides: on both sides he thereby
appeases them by sacrifice, by reverence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:21">9:1:1:21</span></span>21.
With (each set of) eighty (formulas) he utters the Svâhâ <span
id="fr_274"></span>[1](#fn_273.md),--on the first anuvâka, and on eighty,
and on eighty; and the formulas which follow as far as the
'unstringing'-formulas (Vâ*g*. S. XVI, 54-63),--eighties <span
id="fr_275"></span>[2](#fn_274.md) mean food: by means of food he thus
gratifies them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:22">9:1:1:22</span></span>22. He
thus mutters these formulas (the last four of Vâ*g*. S. XVI, 46),
'Reverence be to you, the sparkling (hearts of the gods)!' for this is
his favourite resort, either as a dear son or the heart: hence whenever
he should be in fear of that god (Rudra), let him offer with those
mystic utterances, for he draws nigh unto the favourite resort of that
god, and so that god does not injure him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:23">9:1:1:23</span></span>23.
'Reverence be to you, the sparkling <span

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

for those (Rudras) produce (kar) everything here,--'hearts of the
gods!'--Agni, Vâyu and Âditya (fire, wind and sun), these truly are the
hearts of the gods;--'Reverence to the discriminating!'--for those
(gods) discriminate everything here;--'Reverence to the
destructive!'--for those (gods) destroy whom they wish to
destroy;--'Reverence to the irremovable!'--for those (gods) are not (to
be) removed from these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:24">9:1:1:24</span></span>24. He
then mutters those that follow (Vâ*g*. S. XVI, 47 seq.), 'Chaser! lord
of the (Soma) plant!'--that (god) is indeed a repeller, for he chases
away whom he wishes to chase away;--'lord of the plant'--that is, 'lord
of the Soma-plant;'--'O blue-red cleaver <span
id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_276.md);'--these are names and forms of him: he
thus gratifies him by calling him by his names;--'frighten and hurt not
these people and these cattle! let none of us sicken!' as the text, so
the sense.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:25">9:1:1:25</span></span>25.
That god (Rudra) is the kshatra (ruling power; chieftainship or chief);
and for that chief these peasants set apart this special fore-share, to
wit, that first section (of formulas); and now he (the Sacrificer) sets
apart for him that after-share, and thereby gratifies him; and hence
this (section) also belongs to a single deity, to wit, to Rudra; for it
is him he thereby gratifies.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:26">9:1:1:26</span></span>26.
These are seven formulas,--of seven layers the fire-altar consists, and
the year consists of seven months, and Agni is the year: as great as
Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies
him. These two kinds (of formulas) amount to twenty-one,--the twelve
months, the five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as the
twenty-first (make up) this amount.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:27">9:1:1:27</span></span>27. He
then offers (the libations of the) 'unstringing'-formulas <span
id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_277.md). For at that time the gods, having
gratified those (Rudras) by that food, unstrung their bows by means of
these 'unstringing'-formulas; and in like manner this (Sacrificer),
having gratified them by that food, now unstrings their bows by means of
these 'unstringing'-formulas; for with an unstrung bow one injures no
one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:28">9:1:1:28</span></span>28.
Here now he says 'at a thousand leagues,' for a thousand leagues is the
farthest distance; and he thus unstrings their bows at what is the
farthest distance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:29">9:1:1:29</span></span>29.
And, again, as to why he says 'at a thousand leagues,'--a thousand
leagues means this Agni (fire-altar), for neither this way nor that way
is there any other thing greater than he; and it is when he makes
offering in the fire that he unstrings their bows at a thousand leagues.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:30">9:1:1:30</span></span>30.
'Countless thousands,--in this great sea,'--thus, wheresover they are,
there he unstrings their bows.

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:31">9:1:1:31</span></span>31.
There are ten of these 'unstringing'-offerings he makes,--the Virâ*g*
consists of ten syllables, and Agni is Virâ*g* (widely-shining or
ruling); there are ten regions, and Agni is the regions; there are ten
vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as
is his measure, by so much he thus unstrings their bows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:32">9:1:1:32</span></span>32. He
then offers the descending <span id="fr_279"></span>[1](#fn_278.md) (series
of oblations). For then (in the preceding oblations) he ascends these
worlds upwards from hence: this is, as it were, an ascent away from
here. But this (earth) is a firm resting-place: the gods returned to
this resting-place; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now return to
this resting-place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:33">9:1:1:33</span></span>33.
And, again, as to why he descends. Then (in the preceding oblations) he
goes after those (gods), gratifying (propitiating) them. From thence he
now recovers his own self unto life; and so does he by that self of his
attain all vital power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:34">9:1:1:34</span></span>34.
And., again, as to why he descends. He then (in the preceding oblations)
gratifies those Rudras from hence upwards; he now does so again from
thence hitherwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:35">9:1:1:35</span></span>35.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XVI 64\], 'Reverence be to the Rudras dwelling in the

indeed their arrows, and by the rain they injure whom they wish to
injure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:36">9:1:1:36</span></span>36.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XVI, 65\], 'Reverence be to the Rudras dwelling in the
air,'--he thereby does reverence to those Rudras who are in the
air;--'whose arrows the wind is,' for the wind is indeed their arrows,
and by the wind they injure whom they wish to injure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:37">9:1:1:37</span></span>37.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XVI, 66\], 'Reverence be to the Rudras dwelling upon
earth,'--he thereby does reverence to those Rudras who are in this
(terrestrial) world;--'whose arrows food is,' for food is indeed their
arrows, and by means of food they injure whom they wish to injure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:38">9:1:1:38</span></span>38. 'To
them (I stretch) ten (fingers) forwards, ten to the right, ten
backwards, ten to the left, ten upwards <span
id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_279.md),'--of ten syllables consists the
Virâ*g*, and Agni is Virâ*g*; there are ten seasons, and Agni is the
seasons; there are ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great
as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus
gratifies them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:39">9:1:1:39</span></span>39. And
as to why he says 'ten-ten,'--there are ten fingers in the joined
hands <span id="fr_281"></span>[2](#fn_280.md): he thus makes reverence to
them in each direction; and hence he who is frightened places his hands
together;--'To them be reverence!'--he thus does reverence to
them;--'May they be gracious unto us!'--they thus are gracious unto
him;--'whomsoever we hate, and whosoever hateth us, him we cast into
their jaws!'--thus he casts into their jaws

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

whomsoever he hates, and whosoever hates him. He may say, 'So-and-so I
cast into their jaws!' naming him whom he hates, and then he has no
longer any hold upon him. But let him take no notice of this
(injunction), for indicated of himself is he whom he who knows this
hates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:40">9:1:1:40</span></span>40. In
three turns he descends,--Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is, as
great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies them. With
'Svâhâ' (he makes offering), for the Svâhâ is food: with food he thus
gratifies them. Thrice (in three turns) he ascends from hence
upwards,--that makes six: the significance of this has been
explained <span id="fr_282"></span>[1](#fn_281.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:41">9:1:1:41</span></span>41. And
as to why he descends in three turns,--it is because he ascends in three
turns: thus in as many turns as he ascends, in so many turns does he
descend.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:42">9:1:1:42</span></span>42. He
then throws that arka-leaf <span id="fr_283"></span>[2](#fn_282.md) into
the pit; for it is therewith that he performs that sacrificial work
sacred to Rudra, and that same (leaf) is inauspicious; he now puts it
away, lest any one should tread on this inauspicious (leaf), and suffer
injury thereby: hence (he throws it) into the pit. And, again, as to why
(he throws it) into the pit,--the pit, doubtless, means the fire, and
thus that fire consumes it. Now as to the (symbolic) correspondence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:43">9:1:1:43</span></span>43. As
to this they say, 'How does this *S*atarudriya of his attain to
(conformity with) the year, and Agni? how does it correspond to the
year, to

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agni?' Well, this
*S*atarudriya includes three hundred and sixty (formulas); and (other)
thirty, and thirty-five. Now, as to the three hundred and sixty which
there are, so many are there days in the year: thereby it obtains the
days of the year. And as to the thirty (formulas) which there are, they
are the thirty nights of the month: thereby it obtains the nights of the
month: thus it obtains both the days and nights of the year. And as to
the thirty-five (formulas) there are, they are the thirteenth
month <span id="fr_284"></span>[1](#fn_283), (Agni's.md) self,--the body
(consists of) thirty (limbs <span id="fr_285"></span>[2](#fn_284).md), the
feet of two, the breath of two (in-breathing and off-breathing), and the
head is the thirty-fifth: so much is the year. And in this way this
*S*atarudriya of his attains to (conformity with) the year, Agni, and
corresponds to the year, Agni. And, indeed, in the *S*â*nd*ila
fire-altar as many bricks with formulas attached to them are placed in
the middle, for these bricks are indeed the same as these different
Agnis (invoked in the *S*atarudriya); and thus these Agnis of his come
to have oblations offered to them separately by means of the
*S*atarudriya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:1:1:44">9:1:1:44</span></span>44. As
to this they say, 'How does this *S*atarudriya of his attain to
(conformity with) the Great

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Litany <span
id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_285.md)?--how does it correspond to the Great
Litany?' Well, those twenty-five formulas which there are on both sides
of the eighties <span id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_286.md), they are the
twenty-five-fold body <span id="fr_288"></span>[3](#fn_287.md); and where
the body (of the altar-bird) is, that (includes) the head, and the wings
and tail. And what eighties (of formulas) there are (in the
*S*atarudriya), thereby indeed the (corresponding) eighties (of the
Mahad uktham) are obtained, for by eighties the Great Litany is recited.
And what there is (in the *S*atarudriya) after the eighties that is for
him the same as what there, in the Great Litany, is after the
eighties <span id="fr_289"></span>[4](#fn_288.md); and in this way this
*S*atarudriya

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

of his attains to (conformity with) the Great Litany; in this way it
corresponds to the Great Litany.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[156:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_261.md) Or, here, in this
(atra), in the shape of this (altar) on which the fire is to be
deposited.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[156:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_262.md) That is, that
whereby the deity is propitiated or appeased.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[156:3](sbe4330.htm#fr_263.md) A fanciful
etymology of *S*ata-rudriya, as if it were *s*ânta (propitiated) +
rudriya, instead of 'that which relates to a hundred Rudras'; cf.
[paragraph 7](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:7.md).

<span id="fn_263"></span>[157:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_264.md) That is to say, the
leaf is used in lieu of the ordinary offering-spoon. Whilst making
continual oblations on one of the three stones from this leaf, held in
his right hand, the priest holds a piece of arka wood in his left hand.
Mahîdh. on Vâ*g*. S. XVI, 1.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[158:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_265.md) The site of the
altar is enclosed within a continuous line of 261 pari*s*rits, about
half a foot in width, running along its edge. Their height is
indeterminate, with the exception of three of them, dug in at the back
(west) corner of the left wing, of which one is to reach up to the knee,
the second up to the navel, and the third up to the mouth; each of the
latter two standing to the left (north) of the preceding one.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[158:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_266.md) See I, 7, 3, 20,
with note. Agni, in the form of the formidable Rudra (who is to be kept
at a distance), is referred to.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[159:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_267.md) Literally, the
ruling power.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[159:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_268.md) The first anuvâka
of kâ*nd*a XVI of the Vâ*g*. S. consists of sixteen verses; which of
these the fourteen referred to in the next paragraph are is not clear to
me.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[160:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_269.md) That is from Vâ*g*.
S. XVI, 17 seqq.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[160:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_270.md) Or, who is appealed
to as being known to us, i.e. in terms showing that he is known to us.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[160:3](sbe4330.htm#fr_271.md) That is, aureis
brachiis instructus.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[160:4](sbe4330.htm#fr_272.md) Pra*g*âyâ yad
dhanam asti, Sây.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[160:5](sbe4330.htm#fr_273.md) See [paragraph
28](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:28.md).

<span id="fn_273"></span>[161:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_274.md) The calculation
here, as so often in regard to metres, is rather a loose one. Anuvâka I,
consisting of sixteen verses, is taken as amounting to the first
fourscore formulas; anuvâkas II and III, consisting of ten ka*nd*ikâs
(each of which is calculated to consist of eight mantras), constitute
the second fourscore; anuvâkas IV and V again form the third fourscore;
anuvâkas VI-VIII (save the last four formulas, see [parag.
22](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:22).md), the fourth fourscore; and from there to the
'unstringing'-formulas, that is, from within XVI, 46 to 53, the fifth
fourscore. At the end of each eighty formulas he is to utter one Svâhâ
(sak*ri*t svâhâkâra*h*, Sây.).

<span id="fn_274"></span>[161:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_275.md) An etymological
play on the word 'a*s*îti,' as if derived from a*s*, to eat.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[161:3](sbe4330.htm#fr_276.md) ? Or, scatterers,
sprinklers (kirika), root k*rî*. The author of the <span
id="page_162">p. 162</span> Brâhma*n*a, on the other hand, evidently
takes it in the sense of 'maker, producer.'

<span id="fn_276"></span>[162:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_277) Thus ('Zerspalter'.md)
daridra is probably correctly interpreted (from root 'dar,' to split) by
Prof. Weber; whilst the commentators take it in its ordinary sense of
'poor' (i.e. without an assistant, Mahîdh.); blue-red Rudra is called
inasmuch as he is the 'nîlaka*nth*a' blue-necked, and red all over the
rest of his body.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[163:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_278.md) Viz. Vâ*g*. S. XVI,
54-63: 'What countless thousands of Rudras there are upon earth, their
bows do we unstring at a thousand leagues.--The Bhavas that are in this
great sea, in the air, their bow do we unstring at a thousand leagues.'
Thus each formula ends with the 'unstringing' refrain.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[164:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_279.md) Vâ*g*. S. XVI,
64-66. In making these three oblations to the Rudras in the sky, the
air, and on earth respectively, the procedure is the reverse from that
described in [paragraphs
11](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:11)-[13](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:13.md), viz. first on the
enclosing-stone which reaches up to his mouth, then on that reaching up
to his navel, and lastly on that reaching up to his knee.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[165:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_280.md) These words, as
well as the spaced words in the next paragraph, are added to each of the
three formulas in [paragraphs
35](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:35)-[37](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:37.md).

<span id="fn_280"></span>[165:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_281.md) The joining of the
hollow of the hands, by placing the tips of the fingers together, is a
sign of reverence.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[166:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_282.md) Of objects
numbering six, the seasons commonly occur, e. g. VI, 7, 1, 16.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[166:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_283.md) See [paragraph
4](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:4.md). According to Kâty. *S*rautas. 18, 1, 6 both
offering-utensils (the arka-leaf and the arka-stick) are thrown into the
pit.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[167:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_284.md) As Prof. Weber,
'Die vedischen Nachrichten von den Nakshatra,' p. 298, points out, this
passage points to a six years’ period of intercalation, since, in
counting 360 days in the year, the remainder accumulates in six years to
an intercalary month of thirty-five days (or thirty-six according to
Sat. Br. X, 5, 4, 5); and accordingly in Vâ*g*. S. XXX, 15, and Taitt.
Âr. IV, 19, 1, the names of the six years of such a period of
intercalation are mentioned; while a five years’ period and the names of
the respective years are more frequently referred to.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[167:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_285.md) Viz. twenty fingers
and toes, the upper and lower arms, the thighs and shanks, and the
hands.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[168:1](sbe4330.htm#fr_286.md) For the mahad
uktham, or Great Litany, recited on the Mahâvrata day, see [p.
110](sbe4324.htm#page_110), note [3](sbe4324.htm#fn_202.md). According to
Sâya*n*a, however, this does not refer to the Mahad uktham, or Great
Litany, itself, but to its Stotra, the Mahâvrata-sâman (cf. note on [X,
1, 1, 5](sbe4345.htm#10:1:1:5).md), by the chanting of which it is
preceded, and which, like the Great Litany itself, is represented as
being composed of the different parts of Agni-Pra*g*âpati's bird-shaped
body. Now, that part of the chant which corresponds to the god's trunk
(âtman) is the only part of this Stotra which is chanted in the
Pa*ñk*avi*ms*astoma, or twenty-five-versed hymn-form, which, indeed, is
the characteristic Stoma of the Mahâvrata day, all other Stotras of that
rite being chanted in that form. It is, however, doubtful to me whether
it is not rather the opening part of the Great Litany itself
representing the trunk that is here referred to, and which, indeed,
consists of twenty-five verses; cf. F. Max Müller, Upanishads, I, p.
183. Besides, it has always to be borne in mind that the particular
arrangement of the Great Litany which the authors of the Brâhma*n*a had
before them, may have differed in some respects from those known to us.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[168:2](sbe4330.htm#fr_287.md) See [p.
112](sbe4324.htm#page_112), note [1](sbe4324.htm#fn_204.md).

<span id="fn_287"></span>[168:3](sbe4330.htm#fr_288.md) That is, the body
with its twenty-four limbs, viz. the two arms, two legs, and the twenty
fingers and toes.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[168:4](sbe4330.htm#fr_289.md) According to
Sâya*n*a, the Pa*ñk*avi*ms*a-stotra, chanted after the Mahad uktham, is
here referred to. See [p. 111](sbe4324.htm#page_111.md), note
[1](sbe4324.htm#fn_203.md). Sâya*n*a takes it to refer to the
prose-formulas at the end of the Sastra, which, he says, represent the
mind (buddhi) of Pra*g*âpati.
