### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:2:1">10:1:2:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati was desirous of gaining these worlds. He saw this bird-like
body, the Fire-altar: he

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

fashioned it, and thereby gained this (terrestrial) world. He saw a
second bird-like body, the (chant of the) Great Rite <span
id="fr_538"></span>[1](#fn_530.md): he fashioned it, and thereby gained the
air. He saw a third bird-like body, the Great Litany <span
id="fr_539"></span>[1](#fn_530.md): he fashioned it, and thereby gained the
sky.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:2:2">10:1:2:2</span></span>2. This
built Fire-altar, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, the Great Rite
the air, and the Great Litany the sky: all these, the Fire-altar, the
Great Rite, and the Great Litany, one ought therefore to undertake
together, for these worlds were created together; and as to why the
Fire-altar is built first, it is because of these worlds this
(terrestrial) one was created first. Thus with regard to the deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:2:3">10:1:2:3</span></span>3. Now
with regard to the body. The Fire-altar is the mind, the (chant of the)
Great Rite the breath, and the Great Litany speech: all these one ought
therefore to undertake together, for mind, breath, and speech belong
together; as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because the
mind is prior to the breathings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:2:4">10:1:2:4</span></span>4. The
Fire-altar, indeed, is the body (trunk), the Great Rite the breath, and
the Great Litany speech: all these one ought therefore to undertake
together, for body, breath, and speech belong together; and as to why
the Fire-altar is built first, it is because of him who is produced the
trunk is produced first.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:2:5">10:1:2:5</span></span>5. The
Fire-altar, indeed, is the head, the Great Rite the breath, and the
Great Litany the body:

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

one ought therefore to undertake all these together, for head, breath,
and body belong together; and as to why the Fire-altar is built first,
it is because of him who is born the head is born first; and hence,
whenever all these are undertaken together the Great Litany, indeed, is
accounted the highest (âtamâm) <span id="fr_540"></span>[1](#fn_531.md),
for the Great Litany is the body (or self, âtman).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:2:6">10:1:2:6</span></span>6. As
to this they say, 'If all these are difficult to obtain together, what
(means of) obtaining them is there?'--In the *G*yotish*t*oma (form of
the) Agnish*t*oma <span id="fr_541"></span>[2](#fn_532.md): let him perform
offering with the *G*yotish*t*oma Agnish*t*oma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:2:7">10:1:2:7</span></span>7. In
this *G*yotish*t*oma Agnish*t*oma the Bahishpavamâna (stotra) is (in)
the Triv*ri*t (stoma)--that is the head of the rite; the two other
Pavamânas are (in) the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a and Saptada*s*a (stomas)--they are
the two wings; the Hot*ri*'s

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Â*g*ya (stotra) is
(in) the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a, the P*ri*sh*th*a (stotra in) the Saptada*s*a,
and the Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*iya (stotra in) the Ekavi*ms*a (stoma)--they are
the tail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:2:8">10:1:2:8</span></span>8. Now
these two, the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a and Saptada*s*a, have thirty-two
hymn-verses: twenty-five of these are the twenty-five-fold body <span
id="fr_542"></span>[1](#fn_533.md); and the seven which remain over are the
Parimâd (sâmans), for these are the cattle (or animals), (for) cattle
are sporting all around us (pari-mâd <span
id="fr_543"></span>[2](#fn_534).md)--thus much, then, is the

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Great Rite:
thereby he obtains the Great Rite even in this (Agnish*t*oma).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:2:9">10:1:2:9</span></span>9. And
the Hot*ri* recites seven metres--each subsequent one-versed (metre)
increasing by four (syllables)--with the Virâ*g* as an eighth: these
(eight) consist of three eighties and forty-five syllables. Now by the
eighties thereof the eighties (of the mahad uktham) <span
id="fr_544"></span>[1](#fn_535.md) are obtained, for the Great Litany is
counted (or recited) by eighties (of triplets); and of the forty-five
(syllables which remain) twenty-five are this twenty-five-fold
body <span id="fr_545"></span>[2](#fn_536.md); and where the body is there,
indeed, are (included) the head, and the wings and tail; and the twenty
(syllables which remain) are the insertion <span
id="fr_546"></span>[3](#fn_537.md);--thus much, then, is the Great Litany:
thereby he obtains the Great Litany even in this (Agnish*t*oma). All
these (three) are indeed obtained in the *G*yotish*t*oma Agnish*t*oma:
let him, therefore, perform offering with the *G*yotish*t*oma
Agnish*t*oma.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_529"></span>[285:1](sbe4345.htm#fr_537.md) Viz. inasmuch as
the altar is built on the earth, and the latter forms its foundation.
Comm.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[286:1](sbe4346.htm#fr_539.md) The Mahâvrata-sâman
and the Mahad uktham, as we have seen ([p. 282](sbe4345.htm#page_282.md),
note [5](sbe4345.htm#fn_525); [p. 111](sbe4324.htm#page_111.md), note
[1](sbe4324.htm#fn_203).md), are constructed so as to correspond to the
different parts of the bird-like Agni-Pra*g*âpati.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[287:1](sbe4346.htm#fr_540.md) The combination
'âtamâ*m* khyâyate' is, as it were, the superlative of 'â-khyâyate;' cf.
anutamâ*m* gopâyati, [X, 5, 2, 10](sbe4367.htm#10:5:2:10.md); and Delbrück,
Altind. Syntax, p. 194.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[287:2](sbe4346.htm#fr_541.md) The Agnish*t*oma
may be performed in three different modes, according to the variation of
stomas (or hymn-forms) employed for the stotras (or chants). In the
*G*yotish*t*oma the order of stomas is that set forth in [paragraph
7](sbe4346.htm#10:1:2:7.md), viz.: a. Bahishpavamâna-stotra in the
Triv*ri*t (nine-versed); b. Â*g*ya-stotras, and c.
Mâdhyandina-pavamâna-stotra, in the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a (fifteen-versed); d.
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras, and e. Ârbhava-pavamâna-stotra, in the Saptada*s*a
(seventeen-versed); and f. Agnish*t*oma-sâman (Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*iya) in the
Ekavi*ms*a (twenty-one-versed) stoma, or hymn-form. In the Gosh*t*oma,
on the other hand, the succession of stomas is a. Pa*ñk*ada*s*a, b.
Triv*ri*t, c. d. Saptada*s*a, e. f. Ekavi*ms*a; and in the Âyush*t*oma:
a. Triv*ri*t, b. Pa*ñk*ada*s*a, (c. d.) Saptada*s*a, (e. f.) Ekavi*ms*a.
Cf. part ii, p. 402, note 4; for the scheme of Stotras (and Sastras),
ib. p. 325, note 2. The Agnish*t*oma is singled out here for the reason
that the Mahâvrata-day takes the form of an Agnish*t*oma sacrifice.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[288:1](sbe4346.htm#fr_542.md) See [p.
168](sbe4330.htm#page_168), note [3](sbe4330.htm#fn_287.md).

<span id="fn_534"></span>[288:2](sbe4346.htm#fr_543.md) Sâya*n*a takes
'parimâd' here in the sense of 'a source of pleasure all around'--parito
harshahetava*h*.--The Parimâda*h* are thirteen Sâmans sung (not chanted,
in the proper sense of the word) by the Udgât*ri*, his two assistants
joining merely in the Nidhanas or chorus-like passages. They are given,
figured for chanting, in the Ara*n*yagâna of the Sâma-veda (Calc. ed.,
ii, p. 387 seq.). This performance takes place immediately after the
Adhvaryu has given the sign for, and the Udgât*ri* 'yoked,' the
Mahâvrata-stotra or sâman (i. e. the Hot*ri*'s P*ri*sh*th*astotra of the
Great Rite),--or, according to some authorities, before either the
'yoking,' or the Adhvaryu's summons,--and thus serves as an introduction
to the central and chief element of the Great Rite, the Mahâvrata-sâman.
According to the ritual symbolism, these preliminary sâmans are intended
to supply the newly completed Pra*g*âpati with hair (feathers) and
nails; but the performance would rather seem to he a solemn mode of
doing homage (upasthânam) to the different parts of the bird-like altar
and the sacrificial ground; thus corresponding to a similar, though
simpler, ceremony performed on the completion of the fire-altar in its
simplest form, as described at [IX, 1, 2,
35](sbe4331.htm#9:1:2:35)-[43](sbe4331.htm#9:1:2:43.md). On the present
occasion the ceremony is performed in the following order: 1. near the
head of the altar (the Âhavanîya fire) he sings the Prâ*n*a ('breath;'
Sâma-v., vol. ii, p. 436); 2. near the tail the Apâna
(downward-breathing, ii, p. 437); 3. 4. near the right and left wing the
two Vratapakshau (ii, p. 438); 5. near the left armpit the
Pra*g*âpati-h*ri*daya ('heart of Pra*g*.,' ii, p. 499); 6. near the
*K*âtvâla or pit, the Vasish*th*asya Nihava (Sâma-v., vol. v, p. 602);
7. near the Âgnîdhra hearth the Satrasyarddhi ('success of the
sacrificial session,' ii, p. 465); 8. 9. in front and behind the
Havirdhâna carts, the *S*loka and Anu*s*loka (i, pp. 887-9); <span
id="page_289">p. 289</span> 10. towards the Mâr*g*âlîya the Yâma (ii, p.
461); 11. 12. in front and behind the Sadas, the Âyus, and Navastobha
(ii, pp. 450-51); 13. in front of the Gârhapatya the *Ris*yasya sâman
(ii, p. 324).

<span id="fn_535"></span>[289:1](sbe4346.htm#fr_544.md) See [p.
112](sbe4324.htm#page_112), note [1](sbe4324.htm#fn_204.md).

<span id="fn_536"></span>[289:2](sbe4346.htm#fr_545.md) Viz. the body, as
consisting of the ten fingers, the ten toes, the arms and legs, and the
trunk.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[289:3](sbe4346.htm#fr_546.md) Towards the end of
the Mahad Uktham, in the portion representing the thighs, nine
trish*t*ubh verses (*Ri*g-veda III, 43, 1-8, and X, 55, 5) are inserted
as an 'âvapanam..'
