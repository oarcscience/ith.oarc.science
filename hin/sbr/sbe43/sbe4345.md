# TENTH KÂ*ND*A.

#### THE MYSTERY OF AGNI, THE FIRE-ALTAR.

### FIRST ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:1:1">10:1:1:1</span></span>1. In
the first place that Agni (the Fire-altar), the year, is built <span
id="fr_526"></span>[1](#fn_518.md); thereafter the Great Litany (mahad
uktham) is recited <span id="fr_527"></span>[2](#fn_519.md). When
Pra*g*âpati became relaxed, the vital fluid flowed upwards <span
id="fr_528"></span>[3](#fn_520.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:1:2">10:1:1:2</span></span>2. Now,
that Pra*g*âpati who became relaxed is the year; and those joints of his
which became relaxed are the days and nights.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:1:3">10:1:1:3</span></span>3. And
that Pra*g*âpati who became relaxed is this very Fire-altar which here
is built; and those joints of his, the days and nights, which became
relaxed are no other than the bricks;--thus, when he lays down these (in
the layers of the altar), he thereby restores to him those joints of
his, the days and nights, which had become relaxed: and thus

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

it is even in this (building of the altar) that this Ya*g*us is built
up <span id="fr_529"></span>[1](#fn_521) and secured (for Pra*g*âpati.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:1:4">10:1:1:4</span></span>4. And
that vital fluid (essence) of his which flowed upwards (became) the
Great Litany: it is in quest of that vital fluid that (the priests) go
by means of the *Rik* and Sâman. And when the Ya*g*us marches in front
in this (quest) <span id="fr_530"></span>[2](#fn_522.md), it is in order to
fetch something that that (Veda) goes--even as (one might say), 'That
one thing there is mine, I will fetch it,' so does that Ya*g*us go in
front (or forward). That (vital fluid) they obtain in the course of a
year <span id="fr_531"></span>[3](#fn_523.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:1:5">10:1:1:5</span></span>5. The
Adhvaryu takes (draws) it by means of the Graha (Soma-cup); and inasmuch
as he thereby takes (grab) it, it is (called) Graha <span
id="fr_532"></span>[4](#fn_524.md). The Udgât*ri* puts the vital fluid into
it by means of the (sâman of the) Great Rite (mahâvrata <span
id="fr_533"></span>[5](#fn_525).md); but, indeed, the

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (sâman of the)
Great Rite is (equivalent to) all these (other) sâmans (hymn-tunes): it
is thus by means of all the hymn-tunes that he puts the vital fluid
therein. The Hot*ri* puts the vital fluid therein by means of the Great
Litany; but, indeed, the Great Litany is the same as all these ri*k*
(hymn-verses) <span id="fr_534"></span>[1](#fn_526.md): it is thus by means
of all the hymn-verses that he puts the vital fluid into it (the
Soma-cup).

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:1:6">10:1:1:6</span></span>6. When
those (Udgât*ri*s) chant (the stotra), and when he (the Hot*ri*) recites
(the *s*astra) afterwards, then he (the Adhvaryu) offers that (vital
fluid, in the form of Soma) unto him (Agni-Pra*g*âpati) at the
Vasha*t*-call; and thus this vital fluid enters him. For, indeed, they
do not see it to be the Great Rite that lies there being praised, nor
the Great Litany, but it is Agni alone they see; for Agni is the self
(body), and thus those two, the *Rik* and the Sâman, enter him in the
form of the vital fluid; and thus they both enter (join) the Ya*g*us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:1:7">10:1:1:7</span></span>7. Now,
that Agni (fire-altar) consists of pairs--the first layer and the
second, and the third and fourth; and of the fifth layer the fire which
is placed on the built (altar) is the mate. And, indeed, this body
consists of pairs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:1:8">10:1:1:8</span></span>8. The
thumbs (and great toes, 'aṅgush*th*a,' m.) are males, and the fingers
and toes ('aṅguli,' f.) females; the ears ('kar*n*a' m.) are males, and
the eyebrows ('bhrû,' f.) females; the lips ('osh*th*a,' m.) are males,
and the nostrils ('nâsikâ,' f.) females; the teeth ('danta,' m.) are
males, and the tongue ('*g*ihvâ,' f.) is a female: indeed the whole
(body) consists of pairs, and with this body, consisting of pairs, that
(vital fluid) enters this Agni (the fire-altar), consisting of
pairs <span id="fr_535"></span>[1](#fn_527.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:1:9">10:1:1:9</span></span>9.
This, then, is the entering therein;--even thus, indeed, he (Agni)
consists of pairs <span id="fr_536"></span>[2](#fn_528.md); but in this

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

way also he consists of pairs:--the fire-altar here built up is no other
than this speech, for with speech it is built up; and the fire which is
placed on the built (altar) is the breath; and the breath ('prâ*n*a,'
m.) is the male, the mate, of speech ('vâ*k*,' f.). And, indeed, this
body is speech; and the breath which is in the body is its mate: with
this mated body that (vital fluid) thus enters into the mated Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:1:10">10:1:1:10</span></span>10.
This also is the entering therein;--there is indeed no fear of him
(Agni) being without offspring to whosoever thus knows these two, the
body and Agni, to be a pair; but, indeed, this body is food, as is said
by the *Ri*shi (*Ri*g-veda X, 107, 7), 'The Dakshi*n*â winneth food
which is our own self (breath).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:1:11">10:1:1:11</span></span>11.
Now, this food, when eaten, becomes of two kinds,--that part of it which
is immortal (remains) above the navel: by the upward vital airs it moves
upwards and enters the air; but that part of it which is mortal tends to
move away: it passes beyond the navel, and, having become twofold,
enters this (earth), as urine and faeces. Now that which enters this
(earth) enters the fire-altar <span
id="fr_537"></span>[1](sbe4346.htm#fn_529.md) built here; and that which
enters the air enters that fire which is placed on the built (altar).
This also is the entering therein.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_518"></span>[281:1](sbe4345.htm#fr_526.md) Or, possibly, 'that
Agni is built in a year,' as paragraph [4](sbe4345.htm#10:1:1:4.md) might
seem to suggest. Sâya*n*a, however, takes it in the above
sense,--esho<sup>ऽ</sup>gni*h* Sa*m*vatsarâtmaka*h* purastât pûrva*m*
*k*iyate. The Agni*k*ayana, when properly performed, requires a full
year, whence Agni-Pra*g*âpati is constantly identified with the year and
the seasons.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[281:2](sbe4345.htm#fr_527.md) According to
Sâya*n*a, the intermediate Mahâvrata-sâman (see note [1](#fn_526.md), [p.
283](#page_283).md), chanted prior to the recitation of the Mahad uktham,
is likewise implied here.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[281:3](sbe4345.htm#fr_528.md) Thus--ûrdhvalokam
aga*kkh*at--Sâya*n*a takes 'agram.'

<span id="fn_521"></span>[282:1](sbe4345.htm#fr_529.md) Viz. inasmuch as
ya*g*us-formulas have to be used with the laying down of many of the
bricks (the so-called 'ya*g*ushmatîs'). Whilst, in the case of the *Rik*
and Sâman, other rites are necessary to secure them for the restored
Pra*g*âpati, the Ya*g*us is secured for him in the very act of building
up his body, the fire-altar.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[282:2](sbe4345.htm#fr_530.md) The Adhvaryu priest
has to do all the practical work connected with the sacrificial
performance, the building of the altar, &c.; and inasmuch as it is with
ya*g*us-formulas he does so throughout, the Ya*g*us is said here to take
the lead; cf. [X, 3, 5, 3](sbe4360.htm#10:3:5:3.md).

<span id="fn_523"></span>[282:3](sbe4345.htm#fr_531.md) Viz. by means of
the sacrificial session of sacrificing, chanting, and reciting, called
'Gavâm ayanam' (procession of the cows), lasting for one year, on the
last day but one of which the Mahâvrata, or Great Rite, is performed.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[282:4](sbe4345.htm#fr_532.md) The particular cup
of Soma here referred to is the Mahâvratîya-graha, the special cup of
the Great Rite; cf. [X, 4, 1, 12](sbe4361.htm#10:4:1:12.md) seq.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[282:5](sbe4345.htm#fr_533.md) The central feature
of the Mahâvrata consists in the chanting, at the mid-day service--as
the Hot*ri*'s P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra--of the so-called Mahâvrata-sâman. It
consists of five different parts which,--like those of which the Mahad
uktham, recited after it, is <span id="page_283">p. 283</span>
composed,--are considered as representing different parts of
Agni-Pra*g*âpati's body, viz.: I. Gâyatra-sâman, representing the head;
it is chanted in the triv*ri*t-stoma (nine-versed hymn-form) and
consists of the triplets, Sâma-v. II, 146-8 (= *Ri*g-veda I, 7, 1-3:
indram id gâthino b*ri*hat), II, 263-5 (indro dadhîko asthabhir), and
II, 800-2 (ud ghed abhi *s*rutâmagham); though, according to others, the
Sâma-triplets corresponding to *Ri*g-veda I, 7, I-9 may be chanted
instead. 2. Rathantara-sâman (Sâma-v. II, 30-I), representing the right
wing, chanted in the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a-stoma, or fifteen-versed form. 3.
B*ri*hat-sâman (II, 159-60), the left wing, in the Saptada*s*a-stoma, or
seventeen-versed form. 4. Bhadra-sâman (on II, 460-2; Of. Calc. ed.,
vol. v, p. 402), the tail, in the Ekavi*ms*a, or twenty-one-versed form.
5. Râ*g*ana- sâman (on II, 833-5; cf. Calc. ed., vol. v, p. 449), the
body (âtman), in the Pa*ñk*avi*ms*a-stoma, or twenty-five-versed form;
instead of this the Vâmadevya-sâman (on II, 32-4) may be chanted in the
pa*ñk*anidhana form (Calc. ed., vol. v, p. 45I).--The chanting of this
Stotra is preceded by the singing of thirteen sâmans, called parimâda*h*
(see [X, 1, 2, 8](sbe4346.htm#10:1:2:8).md), followed by certain
ceremonies--buckling armour on a nobleman, driving in a sunwise
direction round the sacrificial ground, shooting arrows at two ox-hides,
beating of drums, &c.--apparently symbolising the driving off of evil
spirits from the sacrifice, or a combat for the possession of (the light
of) the sun. The chanting itself is, according to some authorities,
performed by the Udgât*ri*s, whilst, according to others, all the
priests (except the Hot*ri*, for whom the Maitrâvaru*n*a acts), as well
as the G*ri*hapati, or Sacrificer, take part in turn in the singing of
the sâmans; the Prastot*ri* and Pratihart*ri*; assistants of the
Udgât*ri*; joining in with the successive performers in the Nidhanas, or
finales.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[283:1](sbe4345.htm#fr_534.md) See [p.
110](sbe4324.htm#page_110), note [3](sbe4324.htm#fn_202.md); [p.
112](sbe4324.htm#page_112), note [1](sbe4324.htm#fn_204.md). During his
recitation of the Great Litany, the Hot*ri* is seated on a swing, the
Adhvaryu <span id="page_284">p. 284</span> making his responses whilst
standing on a plank, and the Hot*ri*'s assistants being seated on
bundles of grass.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[284:1](sbe4345.htm#fr_535.md) Or, with this body
as a mate it thus enters this Agni, its mate; literally, with this body
forming one of a (productive) pair, it thus enters this Agni, forming
one (i. e. the other) of a pair.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[284:2](sbe4345.htm#fr_536.md) That is, he has in
him the generative energy. Apparently <span id="page_285">p. 285</span>
'mithuna,' m. has also the sense of paired,' 'mated,' i.e. 'one who has
his complement or mate,' and so perhaps here.
