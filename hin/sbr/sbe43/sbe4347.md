### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:3:1">10:1:3:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati created living beings. From the out- (and in-) breathings he
created the gods, and from the downward breathings the mortal beings;
and

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

above the (mortal) beings he created Death as their consumer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:3:2">10:1:3:2</span></span>2. Now,
one half of that Pra*g*âpati was mortal, and the other half immortal:
with that part of him which was mortal he was afraid of death; and,
being afraid, he became twofold, clay and water, and entered this
(earth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:3:3">10:1:3:3</span></span>3.
Death spake unto the gods saying, 'What has become of him who has
created us?'--'Being afraid of thee, he has entered this (earth),' they
said. He spake, 'Let us search for him, let us gather him up for I shall
not injure him.' The gods gathered him from out of this (earth): that
part of him which was in the water, they gathered as water, and that
which was in this (earth, they gathered) as clay. Having gathered
together both clay and water, they made a brick, whence a brick consists
of both clay and water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:3:4">10:1:3:4</span></span>4. And,
indeed, these five forms (bodily parts) of him are mortal--the hair on
the mouth, the skin, the flesh, the bone, and the marrow; and these are
immortal--the mind, the voice, the vital air; the eye, and the ear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:3:5">10:1:3:5</span></span>5. Now,
that Pra*g*âpati is no other than the Fire-altar which is here built up,
and what five mortal parts there were of him, they are these layers of
earth; and those which were immortal they are these layers of bricks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:3:6">10:1:3:6</span></span>6. The
gods spake, 'Let us make him immortal!' Having encompassed that mortal
form by those immortal forms of his, they made it immortal--the layer of
earth by means of two layers of bricks: in like manner the second, the
third, and the fourth (layers of earth).

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:3:7">10:1:3:7</span></span>7. And
having laid down the fifth layer (of bricks), he (the Adhvaryu) scatters
earth on it; thereon he lays the Vikar*n*î and the Svayamât*rinn*â,
scatters chips of gold, and places the fire: that is the seventh layer,
and that (part) is immortal; and in this way, having encompassed that
mortal form of his by those two immortal forms, they made it
immortal,--the layer of earth by means of two layers of bricks. Thereby,
then, Pra*g*âpati became immortal; and in like manner does the
Sacrificer become immortal by making that body (of the altar) immortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:3:8">10:1:3:8</span></span>8. But
the gods knew not whether they had made him complete, or not; whether
they had made him too large, or left him defective. They saw this verse
(Vâ*g*. S. XVIII, 76), 'The seat-hiding Agni, Indra, god Brahman,
B*ri*haspati, and the wise All-gods may speed our sacrifice unto bliss!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:3:9">10:1:3:9</span></span>9. Of
this (verse) one part is Agni's, one part Indra's, and one part the
All-gods’;--with that part thereof which is Agni's they made up that
part of him (Pra*g*âpati) which is Agni's, and with Indra's (part) that
which is Indra's, and with the All-gods’ (part) that which is the
All-gods’: in this very (fire-altar) they thus made him up wholly and
completely.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:1:3:10">10:1:3:10</span></span>10.
And when he stands by (the altar, worshipping it) with this (verse), he
thereby secures (makes good) all that part of him (Pra*g*âpati) which,
whether he knows it or not, he either does in excess or insufficiently
in this (fire-altar),--whatever has not been secured for him. The
'seat-hiding' (verse) is an Anush*t*ubh, for the Anush*t*ubh is speech,
and the seat-hider is speech: it is by speech that he

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

secures for him what was not secured for him. 'Let him approach (the
altar with this verse) when he has covered a layer with earth,' say
some, 'for then that (layer) becomes whole and complete.'
