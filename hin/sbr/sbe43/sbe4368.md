### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:3:1">10:5:3:1</span></span>1.
Verily, in the beginning this (universe) was, as it were <span
id="fr_753"></span>[3](#fn_741.md), neither non-existent nor existent; in

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

the beginning this (universe), indeed, as it were, existed and did not
exist: there was then only that Mind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:3:2">10:5:3:2</span></span>2.
Wherefore it has been said by the *Ri*shi (*Ri*g-veda X, 129, 1), 'There
was then neither the non-existent nor the existent;' for Mind was, as it
were, neither existent nor non-existent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:3:3">10:5:3:3</span></span>3. This
Mind, when created, wished to become manifest,--more defined <span
id="fr_754"></span>[1](#fn_742.md), more substantial: it sought after a
self (body) <span id="fr_755"></span>[2](#fn_743.md). It practised
austerity <span id="fr_756"></span>[3](#fn_744.md): it acquired
consistency <span id="fr_757"></span>[4](#fn_745.md). It then beheld
thirty-six thousand Arka-fires <span id="fr_758"></span>[5](#fn_746.md) of
its own self, composed of mind, built up of mind: mentally <span
id="fr_759"></span>[6](#fn_747.md) alone they were established (on
sacrificial hearths) and mentally

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

built up <span id="fr_760"></span>[1](#fn_748.md); mentally the cups (of
Soma) were drawn thereat mentally they chanted, and mentally they
recited on (near) them,--whatever rite is performed at the sacrifice,
whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed mentally only, as
a mental performance, on those (fires or fire-altars) composed of mind,
and built up of mind. And whatever it is that (living) beings here
conceive in their mind that was done regarding those (mental Agnis <span
id="fr_761"></span>[2](#fn_749)):--they establish them (on the hearths.md)
and build them up (as fire-altars); they draw the cups for them; they
chant on (near) them and recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the
development of Mind, of that extent its creation,--so great is Mind:
thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of these as great as that
former (fire-altar) was.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:3:4">10:5:3:4</span></span>4. That
Mind created Speech. This Speech, when created, wished to become
manifest,--more defined, more substantial: it sought after a self. It
practised austerity: it acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six
thousand Arka-fires of its own self, composed of speech, built up of
speech: with speech they were established, and with speech built up;
with speech the cups were drawn thereat; with speech they chanted, and
with speech they recited on them--whatever rite is performed at the
sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

performed by speech alone, as a vocal performance, on those (fires)
composed of speech, and built up of speech. And whatever beings here
speak by speech that was done regarding those (fires): they establish
them and build them up; they draw the cups for them; they chant on them
and recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of Speech,
of that extent its creation,--so great is Speech: thirty-six thousand
Arka-fires; and each of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:3:5">10:5:3:5</span></span>5. That
Speech created the Breath. This Breath, when created, wished to become
manifest,--more defined, more substantial: it sought after a self. It
practised austerity: it acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six
thousand Arka-fires of its own self, composed of breath, built up of
breath: with breath they were established, and with breath built up;
with breath the cups were drawn thereat; with breath they chanted and
with breath they recited on them,--whatever rite is performed at the
sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed by
breath alone, as a breathing-performance, on those (fires) composed of
breath, and built up of breath. And whatever beings here breathe with
breath that was done regarding those (fires):--they establish them, and
build them up; they draw the cups for them; they chant on them and
recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of Breath, of
that extent was its creation,--so great is Breath: thirty-six thousand
Arka-fires; and each of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:3:6">10:5:3:6</span></span>6. That
Breath created the Eye. This Eye, when created, wished to become
manifest,--more

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

defined, more substantial: it sought after a self. It practised
austerity: it acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand
Arka-fires of its own self, composed of the eye, built up of the eye: by
means of the eye they were established, and by means of the eye built
up; by the eye the cups were drawn thereat; by means of the eye they
chanted and recited hymns on them,--whatever rite is performed as the
sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed by the
eye alone, as an eye-performance, on those (fires) composed of eye, and
built up of the eye. And whatever beings here see with the eye that was
done regarding those (fires):they establish them and build them up; they
draw the cups for them; they chant on them and recite hymns on them,--of
that extent was the development of the Eye, of that extent its
creation,--so great is the Eye: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each
of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:3:7">10:5:3:7</span></span>7. That
Eye created the Ear. This Ear, when created, wished to become
manifest,--more defined, more substantial: it sought after a self. It
practised austerity: it acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six
thousand Arka-fires of its own self, composed of the ear, built up of
the ear: by means of the ear they were established, and by means of the
ear built up; by the ear the cups were drawn thereat; by means of the
ear they chanted and recited hymns on them,--whatever rite is performed
at the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed
by the ear alone, as an ear-performance, on those (fires) composed of
ear, and built up of the ear. And whatever beings here hear with the ear

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

that was done regarding those (fires):--they establish them and build,
them up; they draw the cups for them; they chant on them and recite
hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of the Ear, of that
extent its creation,--so great is the Ear: thirty-six thousand
Arka-fires; and each of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:3:8">10:5:3:8</span></span>8. That
Ear created Work, and this condensed itself into the vital airs, into
this compound, this composition of food <span
id="fr_762"></span>[1](#fn_750.md); for incomplete is work without the
vital airs, and incomplete are the vital airs without work.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:3:9">10:5:3:9</span></span>9. This
Work, when created, wished to become manifest,--more defined, more
substantial: it sought after a self. It practised austerity: it acquired
consistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand Arka-fires of its own self,
composed of work, built up of (or by) work: by work they were
established, and by work built up; by work the cups were drawn thereat;
by work they chanted and recited hymns on them,--whatever rite is
performed at the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was
performed by work alone, as a work-performance, on those (fires)
composed of work, and built up of work. And whatever beings here work by
work that was done regarding those (fires);--they establish them and
build them up; they draw the cups for them; they chant on them and
recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of Work, of
that

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

extent its creation,--so great is Work: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires;
and each of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:3:10">10:5:3:10</span></span>10.
That Work created the Fire,--Fire, doubtless, is more manifest than
Work, for by work (sacrificial performance) they produce it, and by work
they kindle it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:3:11">10:5:3:11</span></span>11.
This Fire, when created, wished to become manifest,--more defined, more
substantial: it sought after a self. It practised austerity <span
id="fr_763"></span>[1](#fn_751.md): it acquired consistency. It beheld
thirty-six thousand Arka-fires of its own self, composed of fire, built
up of fire: with fire they were established, and with fire built up;
with fire the cups were drawn thereat; with fire they chanted and
recited hymns on them;--whatever rite is performed at the sacrifice,
whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed with fire alone,
as a fire-performance, on those (fires) composed of fire, and built up
of fire. And whatever fire beings here kindle that was done regarding
those (fires):--they establish them and build them up; they draw the
cups for them; they chant on them and recite hymns on them,--of that
extent was the development of Fire, of that extent its creation,--so
great is Fire: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of these as
great as that former (fire-altar) was.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:3:12">10:5:3:12</span></span>12.
These fires (altars), in truth, are knowledge-built; and all beings at
all times build them for him who knows this, even whilst he is asleep:
by knowledge alone these fires (altars) are indeed built for him who
knows this.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_741"></span>[374:3](sbe4368.htm#fr_753.md) Sâya*n*a seems to
take 'iva' here in the sense of 'eva,' as indeed it often has to be
taken, especially in negative sentences.

<span id="fn_742"></span>[375:1](sbe4368.htm#fr_754.md) Niruktatara*m*
nirukta*m* *s*abdanirvâ*k*yam. Sây.

<span id="fn_743"></span>[375:2](sbe4368.htm#fr_755.md) Sâya*n*a also
allows the interpretation, 'after (its source, or cause,) the (supreme)
self,'--âtmâna*m* svakâra*n*a*m* paramâtmâna*m* svasvarûpa*m*
vâ<sup>ऽ</sup>nvai*k*k*h*at. What seems, indeed, implied in these
esoteric lucubrations, is that meditation on the infinite is equivalent
to all ceremonial rites which are supposed to be incessantly performed
for one so engaged, even during his sleep ([paragraph
12](sbe4368.htm#10:5:3:12).md).

<span id="fn_744"></span>[375:3](sbe4368.htm#fr_756.md) I. e. intense
meditation (paryâlokanam), Sây.? 'it became heated.'

<span id="fn_745"></span>[375:4](sbe4368.htm#fr_757.md) Sâya*n*a apparently
takes 'prâmûr*kh*at' in the sense of 'became great, or
important,'--samu*kkh*ritam babhûva.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[375:5](sbe4368.htm#fr_758.md) Sâya*n*a here takes
'arka' in the sense of 'ar*k*anîya (worthy of veneration)', as, indeed,
he did several times before; though once he seems to call them
'agnyarkâ*h*,' as being the highest, merely speculative or immaterial
form of sacrificial fires or fire-altars (dhyeyâ agnaya*h*); cf. [X, 3,
4, 3](sbe4359.htm#10:3:4:3.md) seq.--The 36,000 fires are calculated so as
to be equal to the number of days in the life of the perfect man living
a hundred years ([X, 2, 6, 9](sbe4355.htm#10:2:6:9).md); there being thus
for each day of his life a (spiritual) sacrificial fire, a mental
exercise or discipline, as Sâya*n*a expresses it,--tatraikasmin dine
(âgneyâ?) manov*ri*tti*h*.

<span id="fn_747"></span>[375:6](sbe4368.htm#fr_759.md) The text has
everywhere the instrumental 'manasâ,' which would imply either the
agent, the instrument, or the material, as the case might be.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[376:1](sbe4368.htm#fr_760.md) That is, the
ceremonies of Agnyâdhâna (establishment of the sacrificial fire) and
Agni*k*ayana (building of the fire-altar) were performed by means of
these fires. Sâya*n*a remarks that these rites were performed by the
same 'beings (bhûtâni),' which are mentioned immediately after, as
would, indeed, appear to be the case from [paragraph
12](sbe4368.htm#10:5:3:12.md).

<span id="fn_749"></span>[376:2](sbe4368.htm#fr_761.md) Yat ki*m* *k*a
bhûtâni manasâ dhyâyanti vâ*k*â vadanti tai*h* sa*m*kalpavadanâdibhir
eva teshâm agnînâm kara*n*am. Sây.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[379:1](sbe4368.htm#fr_762.md) Sâya*n*a explains
'sa*m*degham annasa*m*deham' by 'annaprâ*n*â*s*raya*m*
*s*arîram,'--svayam asa*m*deham a*s*arîra*m* sat karma prâ*n*ânnayor
anyonyasâha*k*aryâd abhiv*ri*ddhi*m* vyatirekam makhyenâha, ak*ri*tsnam
&c. Sâya*n*a would thus take 'sa*m*degha' as equivalent to the later
'deha' (body), and in no depreciatory sense.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[380:1](sbe4368.htm#fr_763.md) Or, fervid
devotion; though perhaps the physical sense of 'it became heated' would
suit better here.
