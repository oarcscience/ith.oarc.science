### THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:1:1">10:3:1:1</span></span>1. The
Gâyatrî is the breath (of Pra*g*âpati, the altar), the Ush*n*ih the eye,
the Anush*t*ubh the voice, the B*ri*hatî the mind, the Paṅkti the ear;
the Trish*t*ubh is that generative breath; and the *G*agatî

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

that downward breathing;--these are the seven metres increasing by four
(syllables) each <span id="fr_641"></span>[1](#fn_631.md), which are
produced in Agni (the fire-altar).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:1:2">10:3:1:2</span></span>2. 'The
Gâyatrî is the breath,'--thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is
in the breath that is this one thousand; and to the breath, indeed, this
vigour belongs; for were the breath of him who builds it to pass away,
this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that
(altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Gâyatrîs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:1:3">10:3:1:3</span></span>3. 'The
Ush*n*ih is the eye,'--thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is in
the eye that is this one thousand; and to the eye, indeed, this vigour
belongs, for were the eye-sight of him who builds it to pass away, this
fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that (altar)
becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Ush*n*ihs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:1:4">10:3:1:4</span></span>4. 'The
Anush*t*ubh is the voice,'--thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there
is in the voice that is this one thousand; and to the voice, indeed,
this vigour belongs, for were the voice of him who builds it to pass
away, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form
that (altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Anush*t*ubhs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:1:5">10:3:1:5</span></span>5. 'The
B*ri*hatî is the mind,'--thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is
in the mind that is this one thousand; and to the mind, indeed, this
vigour belongs, for were the mind of him who builds it to pass away,
this fire altar, assuredly,

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

would not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes built (so as
to contain) a thousand B*ri*hatîs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:1:6">10:3:1:6</span></span>6. 'The
Paṅkti is the ear,'--thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is in
the ear that is this one thousand; and to the ear, indeed, this vigour
belongs, for were the power of hearing of him who builds it to pass
away, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form
that (altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Paṅktis.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:1:7">10:3:1:7</span></span>7. 'The
Trish*t*ubh is that generative (life-giving) breath,'--thus, whatever
power, whatever vigour there is in that breath, that is this one
thousand; and to that breath, indeed, this vigour belongs, for were that
breath of him who builds it to become disordered, this fire-altar,
assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes
built (so as to contain) a thousand Trish*t*ubhs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:1:8">10:3:1:8</span></span>8. 'And
the *G*agatî is that downward breathing,'--thus, whatever power,
whatever vigour there is in that breathing, that is this one thousand;
and to that breathing, indeed, this vigour belongs, for were that
breathing of him who builds it to become disordered, this fire-altar,
assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes
built (so as to include) a thousand *G*agatîs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:1:9">10:3:1:9</span></span>9. Now,
these seven metres which increase by four (syllables) successively, and
are firmly established in one another, are those seven vital airs <span
id="fr_642"></span>[1](#fn_632.md) in man, firmly established in one
another: thus, by

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

as much as the number of metres he utters has that (altar) of him who
knows this, prayers uttered upon it in metre after metre, or hymns
chanted, or *s*astras recited, or (bricks) laid down upon it.
