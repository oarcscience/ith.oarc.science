### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:1">8:2:3:1</span></span>1. He
then lays down the Prâ*n*abh*ri*t (bricks). For at that time the gods
said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a
layer!' Whilst meditating, they saw even that layer, the wind: they put
it into that (fire-altar), and in like manner does he (the priest) now
put it therein.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:2">8:2:3:2</span></span>2. He
lays down the Prâ*n*abh*ri*ts,--wind, doubtless, is breath: it is wind
(air) he thus bestows Upon him (Agni). On the range of the Reta*h*si*k*
(they are placed); for the Reta*h*si*k* are these two (worlds): it is
within these two (worlds) that he thus places the wind; whence there is
wind within these two (worlds).

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He places them on
every side: he thus places wind on all sides, whence the wind is
everywhere. \[He places them so as\] on every side to run in the same
direction <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_87.md): he thus makes the wind
everywhere (to blow) in the same direction, whence, having become
united, it blows from all quarters in the same direction. He lays them
down alongside of the regional (bricks) <span
id="fr_89"></span>[2](#fn_88.md): he thereby places the wind in the
regions, whence there is wind in all the regions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:3">8:2:3:3</span></span>3. And,
again, as to why he lays down the Prâ*n*abh*ri*ts;--it is that he
thereby bestows vital airs on these creatures. He places them so as not
to be separated from the Vai*s*vadevîs: he thereby bestows vital airs
not separated from the creatures. \[He lays them down with, Vâ*g*. S.
XIV, 8\], 'Preserve mine up-breathing! Preserve my down-breathing!
Preserve my through-breathing! Make mine eye shine far and wide! Make
mine ear resound!' He thereby bestows on them properly constituted vital
airs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:4">8:2:3:4</span></span>4. He
then lays down the Apasyâ (bricks). For the gods, at that time, spake,
'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!'
Whilst meditating, they saw even that layer, rain:

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

they put it into that (fire-altar) and in like manner does he now put it
therein.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:5">8:2:3:5</span></span>5. He put
on the Apasyâs; for rain is water (ap); it is rain he thereby puts into
it (the altar; or into him, Agni). On the range of the Reta*h*si*k* (he
places them), for, the Reta*h*si*k* being these two (worlds), it is on
these two (worlds) that he thereby bestows rain, whence it rains
therein. He places them on every side: he thus puts rain everywhere,
whence it rains everywhere. \[He places them\] so as everywhere to run
in the same direction <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_89.md): he thereby
bestows rain (falling) everywhere in the same direction, whence the rain
falls everywhere, and from all quarters, in the same direction. He
places them alongside of those referring to the wind <span
id="fr_91"></span>[2](#fn_90.md): he thereby puts rain into the wind,
whence rain follows to whatever quarter the wind goes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:6">8:2:3:6</span></span>6. And,
again, as to why he lays down Apasyâs,--he thereby puts water into the
vital airs. He places them so as not to be separated from the
Prâ*n*abh*ri*ts: he thus places the water so as not to be separate from
the vital airs. Moreover, water is food: he thus introduces food not
separated from (the channels of) the vital airs. \[He lays them down
with, Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 8\], 'Make the waters swell! Quicken the plants!
Bless thou the two-footed! Protect the four-footed! Draw thou rain from
the sky!' He thereby puts water that is made fit, into those (vital
airs).

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:7">8:2:3:7</span></span>7. He
then lays down the *Kh*andasyâ <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_91.md)
(bricks) for the gods, at that time, spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby,
doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst meditating, they
saw even that layer, cattle (or beasts): they put it therein, and, in
like manner, does he now put it therein.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:8">8:2:3:8</span></span>8. He
lays down the *Kh*andasyâs; for the metres (*kh*andas) are cattle: it is
cattle he thus puts into it (or, bestows on him, Agni). On every side
(he places them): he thereby places cattle (or beasts) everywhere,
whence there are cattle everywhere. He places them alongside of the
Apasyâs: he thus establishes the cattle on (or, near) water, whence
cattle thrive when it rains.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:9">8:2:3:9</span></span>9. And,
again, as to why he lays down *Kh*andasyâs. When Pra*g*âpati was
relaxed, the cattle, having become metres, went from him. Gâyatrî,
having become a metre, overtook them by dint of her vigour; and as to
how Gâyatrî overtook them, it is that this is the quickest (shortest)
metre. And so Pra*g*âpati, in the form of that (Gâyatrî), by dint of his
vigour, overtook those cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:10">8:2:3:10</span></span>10.
\[He lays down four in front, with, Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 9\], 'The head is
vigour,'--Pra*g*âpati, doubtless, is the head: it is he that became
vigour;--'Pra*g*âpati the metre,'--Pra*g*âpati indeed became a metre.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:11">8:2:3:11</span></span>11.
'The Kshatra is vigour,'--the Kshatra, doubtless, is Pra*g*âpati, it is
he that became vigour;--'the pleasure-giving metre,'--what is undefined

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

that is pleasure-giving; and Pra*g*âpati is undefined, and Pra*g*âpati
indeed became a metre.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:12">8:2:3:12</span></span>12.
'Support is vigour,'--the support, doubtless, is Pra*g*âpati: it is he
that became vigour;--'the over-lord the metre,'--the over-lord,
doubtless, is Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati indeed became a metre.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:13">8:2:3:13</span></span>13.
'The All-worker is vigour,'--the All-worker, doubtless, is Pra*g*âpati:
it is he that became vigour;--'the highest lord the
metre,'--Pra*g*âpati, the highest lord, doubtless, is the waters, for
they (the waters of heaven) are in the highest place: Pra*g*âpati, the
highest lord, indeed became a metre.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:3:14">8:2:3:14</span></span>14.
These then are four kinds of vigour, and four metres; this (makes)
eight,--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables: this, assuredly, is
that same Gâyatrî in the form of which Pra*g*âpati then, by his vigour,
overtook those cattle; whence they say of worn-out cattle that they are
overtaken by vigour (or, age), and hence (the word) 'vigour' recurs with
all (these bricks). And those cattle which went away from him
(Pra*g*âpati) are these fifteen other (formulas): the cattle are a
thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is fifteenfold: whence he who possesses
cattle, drives off the evildoer, for the thunderbolt drives off the
evildoer for him. And in whatever direction, therefore, the possessor of
cattle goes, that he finds torn up by the thunderbolt.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[34:1](sbe4309.htm#fr_88.md) That is, the bricks
placed in opposite quarters, run in the same direction; see [p.
26](sbe4307.htm#page_26), note [3](sbe4307.htm#fn_81.md).

<span id="fn_88"></span>[34:2](sbe4309.htm#fr_89.md) The Prâ*n*abh*ri*ts
are placed beside the Vai*s*vadevîs so as to be separated from them by
the respective section of the anûkas or 'spines' (dividing the square
'body' of the altar into four quarters). Each Vai*s*vadevî would thus be
enclosed between an Â*s*vinî and a Prâ*n*abh*ri*t; but whilst the
Â*s*vinî and Vai*s*vadevî are placed in the same section (or quarter) of
the altar, the Prâ*n*abh*ri*t comes to lie in the adjoining section,
moving in the sunwise direction from left to right.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[35:1](sbe4309.htm#fr_90.md) See [p.
26](sbe4307.htm#page_26), note [3](sbe4307.htm#fn_81.md).

<span id="fn_90"></span>[35:2](sbe4309.htm#fr_91.md). The five Apasyâ
bricks are placed immediately to the right of the Prâ*n*abh*ri*ts
(looking towards the latter from the centre of the altar), so as to fill
up the four remaining spaces between the four sets of bricks on the
range of the Reta*h*si*k*.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[36:1](sbe4309.htm#fr_92.md) These are otherwise
called Vayasyâ (conferring vigour, or vitality), each formula containing
the word vayas, 'vitality, force.' There are nineteen such bricks which
are placed on the four ends of the two 'spines,' viz. four on the front,
or east end of the spine proper, and five on the hind end of it as well
as on each end of the 'cross-spine.'
