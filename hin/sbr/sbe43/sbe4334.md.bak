### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:1">9:2:3:1</span></span>1. He
(the Adhvaryu) then gives orders (to his assistant, the
Pratiprasthât*ri*); 'Lift the log <span id="fr_328"></span>[1](#fn_323.md)!
hold up the underlayer!'--\[To the Hot*ri*\], 'Recite for

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agni as he is
taken forward!'--'Agnîdh, follow up with the single sword
(-line)!'--'Brahman, mutter the Apratiratha (hymn)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:2">9:2:3:2</span></span>2. For at
that time, as the gods were about to come up in order to perform this
sacrifice, the Asuras, the mischievous fiends, tried to smite them from
the south, saying, 'Ye shall not sacrifice! ye shall not perform the
sacrifice!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:3">9:2:3:3</span></span>3. The
gods said to Indra, 'Thou art the highest and mightiest, and strongest
of us: do thou hold those fiends in check!'--'Let the Brahman (n.) be my
ally!' he said.--'So be it!' They made B*ri*haspati his ally, for
B*ri*haspati is the Brahman (the priesthood); and having had the Asuras,
the mischievous fiends, chased away in the south by B*ri*haspati and
Indra, they spread this sacrifice in a place free from danger and
devilry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:4">9:2:3:4</span></span>4. Now
what the gods did then, that is done on this occasion. Those fiends, it
is true, have now been chased away by the gods themselves, but when he
does this, he does so thinking, 'I will do what the gods did;' and
having had the Asuras, the mischievous fiends, chased away in the south
by Indra and B*ri*haspati, he performs this sacrifice in a place free
from danger and devilry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:5">9:2:3:5</span></span>5. As to
that Indra, he is that Apratiratha (irresistible hymn); and as to that
B*ri*haspati, he is the Brahman (priest) thus, when the Brahman mutters
the Apratiratha (hymn) he (the Sacrificer), having the Asuras, the
mischievous fiends, chased away in the south, by Indra and B*ri*haspati,
performs this sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry. This is
why the Brahman mutters the Apratiratha (hymn, Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 33-44;
*Ri*g v. S. X, 103,1-12).

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:6">9:2:3:6</span></span>6. 'The
swift (Indra), sharpening (his weapon), like a terrible bull,'--these
are twelve suitable (verses) relating to Indra,--a year consists of
twelve months, and Agni (the fire-altar) is the year: as great as Agni
is, as great as is his measure, by so much he drives off the Asuras, the
mischievous fiends, in the south. With trish*t*ubh <span
id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_324) (verses he does so.md),--the Trish*t*ubh is
the thunderbolt: by the thunderbolt he thus drives off the Asuras, the
mischievous fiends, in the south. They amount to twenty-two
Gâyatrîs <span id="fr_330"></span>[1](#fn_324.md), and thus they relate to
Agni, for this is Agni's performance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:7">9:2:3:7</span></span>7. He
then takes him up (in the form of a burning piece of firewood), with
\[Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 53\], 'Upwards may the All-gods bear thee, O Agni, by
their thoughts! . . .' the meaning of this has been explained <span
id="fr_331"></span>[2](#fn_325.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:8">9:2:3:8</span></span>8. They
then go forward, with (Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 54-58), 'May the divine regions,
the goddesses, protect the sacrifice!'--The gods and the Asuras, both of
them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, were contending for the regions, and the
gods wrested the regions from the Asuras; and in like manner does the
Sacrificer now wrest the regions from his hateful rival. 'Divine' he
says, and thereby makes them divine for himself;--'may the goddesses
protect the sacrifice,' that is, 'may the goddesses protect this
sacrifice!'--'keeping off want and ill-will,'--want is hunger: thus,
'keeping off hunger;'--'granting

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

to the lord of the sacrifice a share in wealth-affluence,' that is,
'granting to the lord of the sacrifice a share in wealth and in
affluence;' 'may the sacrifice be founded on wealth-affluence!'--that
is, 'may the sacrifice be founded on wealth and affluence!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:9">9:2:3:9</span></span>9.
'Glorifying on the kindled fire,'--the glorifying one is the
Sacrificer;--'the hymn-winged,'--for hymns are his
wings;--'taken,'--that is, 'held;'--'praiseworthy,'--that is, 'worthy of
worship;'--'(when) they sacrificed, encircling the heated
cauldron,'--for they did sacrifice, whilst encircling the heated
(Pravargya) cauldron; 'when the gods offered the sacrifice with
food,'--for the gods did offer this sacrifice with food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:10">9:2:3:10</span></span>10. 'To
the divine, fostering upholder,'--for he, Agni, is the divine upholder,
the most fostering;--'he, the approacher of gods, the well-disposed, of
a hundred draughts,'--for he is indeed an approacher of the gods, and
well-disposed, and possessed of a hundred draughts;--'encircling, the
gods drew nigh unto the sacrifice,'--for encircling him (Agni), the gods
drew nigh to the sacrifice;--'the gods stood ready to perform the cult
unto the gods,'--the cult, doubtless, is the sacrifice, thus, 'the gods
stood ready to perform the sacrifice to the gods.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:11">9:2:3:11</span></span>11.
'The welcome oblation slaughtered by the slaughterer <span
id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_326.md) to sacrifice;'--that is, 'wished-for,
much wished-for;'--'where the fourth sacrifice goeth to the
offering,'--the Adhvaryu first mutters the formulas, the Hot*ri*
afterwards recites

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

the verses, the Brahman mutters the Apratiratha (hymn) on the south
side; this (set of verses), then, is the fourth sacrifice;--'may the
prayers, the blessings favour us <span
id="fr_333"></span>[1](#fn_327.md)!'--that is, 'may both prayers and
blessings favour us!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:12">9:2:3:12</span></span>12.
'The sun-rayed, golden-haired Savit*ri* ever lifted up <span
id="fr_334"></span>[2](#fn_328.md) the light in front,'--this Agni,
doubtless, is yonder sun, and that sun-rayed, golden-haired Savit*ri* in
front ever lifts up that light;--'at his behest Pûshan goeth, the
wise,'--Pûshan, doubtless, means cattle, and they indeed start forth at
his (Agni-Sûrya's) behest;--'viewing all beings as their guardian,'--for
he indeed views everything here, and he is the protector of all this
world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:13">9:2:3:13</span></span>13.
Now, the gods thereby (viz. by these five verses) wrested from the
Asuras the five regions which are on this side of yonder sun, and then
ascended them; and so does the Sacrificer now wrest them from his
hateful rival, and then ascend them. And by means of them the gods
reached this place, and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) by means
of them reach this place <span id="fr_335"></span>[3](#fn_329.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:14">9:2:3:14</span></span>14. He
then sets up a variegated stone;--the

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

variegated stone, doubtless, is yonder sun: it is thus yonder sun that
is set up. It is variegated, for by means of its rays that disk is
variegated. He sets it up between the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya; for
the Gârhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and the Âhavanîya is the
sky: he thus places him (the sun) between these two worlds, whence he
shines between these two worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:15">9:2:3:15</span></span>15. On
the Âgnîdhra range <span id="fr_336"></span>[1](#fn_330) (he places it.md),
for the Âgnîdhra's fire-shed is the air; he thus places it in the air,
whence that (sun) has the air for his seat. Halfway (between the two
fires he places it); for that (sun) is halfway from this (earth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:16">9:2:3:16</span></span>16.
This (stone) is the breath,--he thus puts the breath into the body; and
it is the vital power,--he thus puts vital power into the body; it is
food, for it is vital power, and vital power is indeed food. It is a
stone, for a stone is firm: he thus makes the vital power firm. It is
variegated, for food is variegated (varied).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:17">9:2:3:17</span></span>17. He
sets it up (with, Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 59, 60), 'Measuring he keeps in the
middle of the sky,'--for that (sun) indeed keeps measuring in the middle
of the sky;--'filling the two worlds and the air,' for even in rising he
fills these (three) worlds, 'he scans the all-reaching, the
butter-reaching,'--he thereby means the offering-ladles and the
offering-grounds;--'between the front and back lights,'--that is,
between this world and that one; or that (fire-altar) which is here at
this moment being built, and that which was there built at first.

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:18">9:2:3:18</span></span>18.
'The showering ocean, the ruddy bird,'--for he (the sun) is indeed a
showering ocean, and a ruddy bird,--'hath entered the seat of his
easterly father,'--for he indeed enters that seat of his easterly <span
id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_331.md) father;--'the many-hued rock set up in
the middle of the sky,'--for that variegated stone is indeed set up in
the middle of the sky;--'hath traversed and guardeth the two ends of the
atmosphere;'--for in traversing he guards the ends of these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:19">9:2:3:19</span></span>19.
With two (verses) he sets it up;--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the
Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,
with so much he thus sets him (the sun, Agni) up. With trish*t*ubh
(verses he sets him up),--for that (sun) is related to the Trish*t*ubh.
He does not 'settle' (the stone), for unsettled is that (sun); nor does
he pronounce the Sûdadohas over it;--the Sûdadohas means the breath, and
that (sun) is the breath, and why should he put breath into (or on) the
breath? Having deposited it in such a way that it is not lost;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:20">9:2:3:20</span></span>20.
They now approach (the fire-altar, with, Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 61-64), They
all have magnified Indra,'--the meaning of this has been explained <span
id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_332.md). 'Let the god-invoking sacrifice lead
hither, let the favour-invoking sacrifice lead hither (the gods)!'--both
god-invoking and favour-invoking indeed is the sacrifice; 'let Agni, the
god, make offering and lead hither the gods!' that is, 'may

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agni, the god,
both make offering and bring hither the gods!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:21">9:2:3:21</span></span>21.
'The creation of strength hath upheaved me with upheaval, and Indra hath
laid low mine enemies by subdual,'--as the text, so the meaning.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:22">9:2:3:22</span></span>22.
'May the gods advance the Brahman both by upheaval and subdual; and may
Indra and Agni scatter asunder mine enemies!'--as the text, so the
meaning.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:23">9:2:3:23</span></span>23.
Now, the gods thereby (viz. by these four verses) wrested from the
Asuras the four regions which are above yonder sun, and then ascended
them; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby wrest them from his
hateful enemy, and then ascend them. And by means of them the gods then
attained to that place; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) by
means of them attain thither.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:24">9:2:3:24</span></span>24.
They then mount the fire-altar, with (Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 65-69), 'By Agni
ascend ye to the firmament!'--the firmament, doubtless, is the heavenly
world: thus, 'by means of this Agni (fire-altar) ascend ye to that
heavenly world!'--'holding the Ukhya in your hands,'--for the Ukhya (the
fire in the pan) they do hold in their hands <span
id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_333.md);--'having gone to the back of the sky,
to heaven, keep ye mingling with the gods!'--that is, 'having gone to
the back of the sky, to the heavenly world, keep ye mingling with the
gods!'

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:25">9:2:3:25</span></span>25. 'Go
thou forth to the eastern quarter, knowing!'--the eastern quarter,
doubtless, is Agni's: thus, 'To thine own quarter go thou forth,
knowing!'--'be thou Agni's fore-fire here, O Agni!'--that is, 'Of this
Agni (*k*itya) be thou, O Agni, the fore-fire <span
id="fr_340"></span>[1](#fn_334.md)!'--'Shine thou, illumining all
regions!'--that is, 'shine thou, illuminating every region!'--'Grant
thou food to our two-footed and four-footed one!' he thereby invokes a
blessing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:26">9:2:3:26</span></span>26.
'From the earth have I ascended the air; from the air have I ascended
the sky;'--for from the Gârhapatya they go to the Âgnîdhrîya, and from
the Âgnîdhrîya to the Âhavanîya;--'from the sky, the back of the
firmament, have I gone to heaven, to the light;'--that is, 'from the
sky, the back of the firmament, have I gone to the heavenly world.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:27">9:2:3:27</span></span>27.
'The heaven-going look not round, they ascend the heaven, the two
worlds,'--those who go to the heavenly world do not indeed look round
 <span id="fr_341"></span>[2](#fn_335.md); 'the wise who performed the
all-sustaining sacrifice,'--for that sacrifice is indeed
all-sustaining <span id="fr_342"></span>[3](#fn_336.md), and they who
perform it are indeed wise.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:28">9:2:3:28</span></span>28. 'Go
forward, Agni, first of the godward-going,'--he thereby says to this
Agni (that is carried forward), 'Go thou forward, as the first of these
godward-going ones; the eye of the gods

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

and of mortals,'--for this (Agni) is indeed the eye of both gods and
men;--'they who love to sacrifice together with the Bh*ri*gus,'--that
is, 'sacrificing together with the Bh*ri*gus,'--'let the offerers go
unto heaven, hail!'--that is, 'may the offerers go to the heavenly
world, hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:29">9:2:3:29</span></span>29.
Now, the gods thereby (viz. by these five verses) wrested from the
Asuras the five regions which are in yonder world, and then ascended
them; and so does the Sacrificer thereby wrest them from his hateful
enemy, and then ascend them. And by means of them the gods attained
thither, and so also does this (Sacrificer) by means of them attain
thither.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:30">9:2:3:30</span></span>30. He
then makes offering on that (firebrand);--for now that he (Agni) had
arrived the gods thereupon gratified him with food, this oblation; and
in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he (Agni) has arrived,
thereupon gratify him with food, this oblation. With milk from a black
(cow) which has a white calf (he makes offering); the black (cow) with a
white calf is the night, and her calf is yonder sun: he thus regales him
with his own share, with his own relish. On it (the firebrand, he
offers) while it is held above (the naturally-perforated brick); for
above (everything) is he whom he thereby gratifies. By means of the
milk-pail (he offers), for with the milk-pail milk is given away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:31">9:2:3:31</span></span>31.
And, again, as to why he makes offering upon it. That (Âhavanîya) fire
is the head of the sacrifice, and milk means breath: he thus puts breath
into the head. He should make the offering so that it (the milk) flows
on the naturally-perforated (brick);--the naturally-perforated one is
breath, and this

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (milk) is vital
sap: he thus connects and puts together the head and the breath by means
of vital sap. \[He pours it out, with, Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 70, 71\], 'Night
and Dawn, of one mind, unlike in form,'--the meaning of this has been
explained <span id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_337.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:32">9:2:3:32</span></span>32. 'O
Agni, thousand-eyed!--through the chips of gold <span
id="fr_344"></span>[2](#fn_338.md) Agni is indeed
thousand-eyed;--hundred-headed,'--inasmuch as, at that time <span
id="fr_345"></span>[3](#fn_339.md), he was created as the hundred-headed
Rudra;--'thine are a hundred out-breathings, and a thousand
through-breathings,'--his indeed are a hundred out-breathings and a
thousand through-breathings who is hundred-headed and
thousand-eyed;--'thou art the master of wealth,'--that is, 'thou art the
master of all wealth;'--'to thee, our strength, do we give honour!'--he
(Agni) is indeed the strength <span id="fr_346"></span>[4](#fn_340.md): it
is him he thereby gratifies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:33">9:2:3:33</span></span>33.
With two (verses) he makes offering thereon,--two-footed is the
Sacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as
is his measure, with so much he thus makes offering to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:34">9:2:3:34</span></span>34. He
then lays it (the firebrand) down, with (Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 72, 73), 'A
well-winged bird thou art,'--for on that former occasion he, by means of
the fashioning-formula, fashions him into a well-winged bird <span
id="fr_347"></span>[5](#fn_341.md); that well-winged bird he builds up, and
having fashioned that well-winged bird, he finally sets him down;--'seat
thee on the back

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

of the earth, fill the air with thy shine, prop the sky with thy light,
and uphold the quarters by thy lustre!'--for that one (Agni) indeed does
all this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:35">9:2:3:35</span></span>35.
'Receiving offering, kind-faced, in front,'--that is, 'receiving
offering, kind-faced for us, in front;'--'seat thee, O Agni, aright in
thine own seat!'--for this (fire-altar) is his (Agni's) own seat: thus,
'do thou rightly seat thee in it!'--'in this higher abode,'--the higher
abode, doubtless, is the sky;--'sit ye down, the All-gods and the
Sacrificer!'--he thus establishes the Sacrificer together with the
All-gods. With two (verses) he deposits it: the significance of this has
been explained,--with the Vasha*t*-call: the significance of this (will
be explained) farther on.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:36">9:2:3:36</span></span>36. He
then puts pieces of firewood thereon; for now that he (Agni) had
arrived, the gods thereupon gratified him with food, both pieces of
firewood and oblations; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now
that he has arrived, thereupon gratify him with food, both pieces of
wood and oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:37">9:2:3:37</span></span>37. He
first puts on one of *s*amî-wood (acacia suma). For at that time, when
this oblation had been offered, he (Agni) was enkindled and blazed up.
The gods were afraid of him, lest he might injure them. They saw this
*s*amî tree, and therewith appeased him; and inasmuch as they appeased
(*s*am) him by that *s*amî, it is (called) *S*amî; and in like manner
this (Sacrificer) now appeases him by means of that *s*amî (wood),--just
with a view to appeasement, not for food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:38">9:2:3:38</span></span>38.
\[He puts it on, with, Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 74\], 'I desire the manifest
favour of the admirable

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Savit*ri*, enjoyed
by all men; that great cow of his, the thousand-streamed, teeming with
milk, which Ka*n*va was wont to milk;'--for Ka*n*va indeed saw her, and
she, the thousand-streamed, milked him all his wishes (objects of
desire); and in like manner does the thousand-streamed one now milk to
the Sacrificer all his objects of desire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:39">9:2:3:39</span></span>39. He
then puts on one of vikaṅkata (flacourtia sapida) wood--the significance
whereof has been explained--with (Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 75), 'To thee give we
honour, O Agni, in the highest home;'--his highest home, doubtless, is
the sky;--'to thee give we honour, in hymns of praise, in the lower
abode;'--the lower abode, doubtless, is the air;--'the birth-place
whence thou hast arisen do I worship,'--that is, 'this is his (Agni's)
own birth-place: that I worship;'--'on thee, when kindled, offerings are
poured forth;'--for when he (the fire) is kindled, they make offerings
on him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:40">9:2:3:40</span></span>40. He
then puts on one of udumbara (ficus glomerata) wood;--the Udumbara means
strength and sap: with strength and sap he thus gratifies him. It has
forking branches <span id="fr_348"></span>[1](#fn_342.md),--forking
branches mean cattle: with cattle, as food, he thus gratifies him. If he
cannot get one with bifurcate branches, let him take up a globule of
sour curds and put it on (the wood): that globule of sour curds which
supervenes is a form of cattle. With the virâ*g* (verse, Vâ*g*. S. XVII,
76; *Ri*g-veda VII, I, 3),

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Kindled, blaze
forth, O Agni, before us, (with inexhaustible flame, O youngest!
perpetual viands accrue unto thee!)'--he puts it on;--the Virâ*g* means
food: with food he thus gratifies him. Three pieces of wood he puts
on,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,
with so much food he thus gratifies him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:41">9:2:3:41</span></span>41. He
then offers oblations,--this is just as if, after serving food to some
one, one gives him something to drink. With the dipping-spoon (sruva) he
offers the first two, with the offering-ladle (sru*k*) the last
(oblation); (the first) with (Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 77), 'O Agni, may we, with
hymns and thoughts, speed this day this (sacrifice) of thine, even as a
steed, as a noble, heart-stirring deed!'--that is, 'whatever
heart-stirring hymn is thine, may I speed (perform) that for thee.' With
a paṅkti (verse) he offers,--of five feet consists the Paṅkti, of five
layers the fire-altar, five seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as
great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus
gratifies him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:42">9:2:3:42</span></span>42. He
then offers (the second oblation), the one for
Vi*s*vakarman,--Vi*s*vakarman (the all-worker) is this Agni: it is him
he thereby gratifies,--with (Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 78), 'Thought I offer, with
mind and ghee,'--that is, 'The thought of these (priests and Sacrificer)
I offer with mind and ghee;'--'that the gods come hither,'--that is,
'that the gods may come hither;'--'enjoying their offering-meal, the
holy-minded,'--that is, the true-minded;--'to Vi*s*vakarman, the lord of
all existence, I offer,'--that is, 'to that Vi*s*vakarman who is the
lord of all that here exists I offer;'--'every day the

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

unimpaired oblation,'--that is, 'always the uninjured oblation.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:43">9:2:3:43</span></span>43. He
then offers a full (-spoon) oblation,--the full means everything: with
everything he thus gratifies him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:44">9:2:3:44</span></span>44.
\[He offers, with, Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 79\], Thine, O Agni, are seven
logs,'--logs mean vital airs, for the vital airs do kindle him;--'seven
tongues,'--this he says with regard to those seven persons which they
made into one person <span id="fr_349"></span>[1](#fn_343.md);--'seven
*Ri*shis,'--for seven *Ri*shis they indeed were;--'seven beloved
seats,'--this he says with regard to the metres, for his seven beloved
seats are the metres;--'sevenfold the seven priests worship thee,'--for
in a sevenfold way the seven priests indeed worship him;--'the seven
homes,'--he thereby means the seven layers (of the altar);--'fill
thou!'--that is, 'generate thou;'--'with ghee,'--ghee means seed: he
thus lays seed into these worlds;--'svâhâ!'--the svâhâ (hail!) is the
sacrifice; he thus at once makes everything here fit for sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:45">9:2:3:45</span></span>45.
'Seven' he says each time,--of seven layers the fire-altar consists, and
of seven seasons the year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as
great as is his measure, with so much he thus gratifies him. Three
oblations he offers,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great
as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him. Three logs
he puts on,--that makes six: the significance of this has been
explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:46">9:2:3:46</span></span>46.
Standing he puts on the logs,--the logs are bones, and bones stand, so
to speak. Sitting he

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

offers the oblations,--oblations are the flesh, and the flesh sits
(lies), so to speak. The logs are inside (the fire), and the oblations
outside, for the bones are inside, and the flesh is outside.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:47">9:2:3:47</span></span>47.
Now, then, as to the (mystic) correspondence (or, amount). Six he offers
before (the leading forward of the fire), and six afterwards; with six
(formulas) they proceed up to the variegated stone; with two he lays
down the variegated stone; with four they proceed as far as the
fire-altar; with five they mount the fire-altar: that makes twenty-nine,
and the oblation itself is the thirtieth. With two (verses) he deposits
the fire,--that makes thirty-two, and of thirty-two syllables consists
the Anush*t*ubh: such, then, is this Anush*t*ubh.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:48">9:2:3:48</span></span>48. And
this one (Anush*t*ubh) they bring hither from those three Anush*t*ubhs
which they make up on the Gârhapatya <span
id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_344.md); and inasmuch as they bring this
(therefrom) hither, thereby this whole Agni (fire-altar) becomes
completed. But now he was not yet fit to eat food <span
id="fr_351"></span>[2](#fn_345.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:49">9:2:3:49</span></span>49. He
said to Agni <span id="fr_352"></span>[3](#fn_346.md), 'By thee I will eat
food!'--So be it!' Hence it is only when they bring him hither, that
this (*k*ityâgni) becomes fit to eat food, to eat oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:50">9:2:3:50</span></span>50.
Moreover, they say, 'It is Pra*g*âpati himself who takes this (Agni) as
his dear son to his bosom;' and verily, whosoever so knows this, takes
thus a dear son to his bosom.

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:3:51">9:2:3:51</span></span>51.
And, again, as to why they bring it here,--the Agni (fire-altar) which
is built up here is the same as those seven persons which they made into
one person; and that excellence and life-sap of them which they
concentrated above, that is the fire which they now bring here,--hence,
when they now bring it here, they concentrate above (in the head) that
excellence and life-sap which belonged to those seven persons,--that is
his (Agni's) head, and this built-up fire-altar is the body: having thus
completed his body, he restores the head to it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_323"></span>[191:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_328.md) Viz. a burning
piece of wood taken from the Gârhapatya hearth to serve as the new
Âhavanîya on the great fire-altar. The Gârhapatya fire, it will be
remembered, was the Ukhya Agni, or the sacred fire carried in a pan
(ukhâ) by the Sacrificer during his time of initiation (dîkshâ) lasting
for a year (or some other definite period), till, at the end of that
period, at the beginning of the Prâya*n*îya, or opening-offering, it was
transferred from the pan to the newly-built Gârhapatya hearth.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[193:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_330.md) The trish*t*ubh
verse consists of 4 × 11 syllables, hence the twelve verses of together
528 syllables. The gâyatrî verse, on the other hand, consists of 3 × 8
syllables; and twenty-two such verses would thus consist of altogether
528 syllables.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[193:2](sbe4334.htm#fr_331.md) Viz. VI, 8, 1, 7.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[194:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_332.md) Mahîdhara takes
'*s*amitâ' to stand for '*s*amitrâ.'

<span id="fn_327"></span>[195:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_333.md) ? Or, 'May they
favour our prayers and blessings!' These verses are rather enigmatical.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[195:2](sbe4334.htm#fr_334.md) The author of the
Brâhma*n*a connects 'udayâ*m*' with 'yam,' Mahîdhara with 'yâ' (udayân
for udayât).

<span id="fn_329"></span>[195:3](sbe4334.htm#fr_335.md) ? Or, reach *that*
place; Sâya*n*a, in the first instance, takes it to mean 'as far as this
place' (from beyond the sun down to the end of the air); but in the
second instance, he takes it as referring to the particular spot on the
sacrificial ground near which this part of the ceremonial is performed,
viz. the Âgnîdhra's fire-shed (as representing the air), south of which
the Adhvaryu lays down a variegated stone close to the 'spine.'

<span id="fn_330"></span>[196:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_336.md) That is, where the
Âgnîdhra shed and hearth will afterwards have to be erected (see [IX, 4,
3, 5](sbe4341.htm#9:4:3:5)-[6](sbe4341.htm#9:4:3:6).md) on the northern
edge of the Vedi, midway between the Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya
fire-places.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[197:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_337.md) Thus Mahîdhara here
takes 'pûrva,' and apparently also the author of the Brâhma*n*a; the
easterly father being the Âhavanîya, and hence the sky. In the formula
it would rather seem to mean former, old.'

<span id="fn_332"></span>[197:2](sbe4334.htm#fr_338.md) See [VIII, 7, 3,
7](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:7.md).

<span id="fn_333"></span>[198:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_339.md) Viz. inasmuch as
the firebrand now being carried forward to the great fire-altar, where
it is henceforth to serve as Âhavanîya, was taken from the Gârhapatya
fire, which itself is identical with the Ukhya Agni, or fire carried
about by the Sacrificer in the Ukhâ, or pan, during his period of
initiation. See [p. 191](sbe4333.htm#page_191), note [1](#fn_323.md).

<span id="fn_334"></span>[199:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_340.md) Mahîdhara takes
'puro’gni' in the sense of fore-goer (puras agre aṅgati ga*kkh*ati).

<span id="fn_335"></span>[199:2](sbe4334.htm#fr_341.md) That is, according
to Mahîdhara, they think not of their sons, cattle, &c.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[199:3](sbe4334.htm#fr_342.md) Thus Mahîdhara
takes 'vi*s*vatodhâra;' 'flowing in every direction' (vi*s*vato +
dhârâ), St. Petersb. Dict.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[201:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_343.md) Viz. VI, 7, 2, 2.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[201:2](sbe4334.htm#fr_344.md) See [IX, 2, 1,
1](sbe4332.htm#9:2:1:1.md).

<span id="fn_339"></span>[201:3](sbe4334.htm#fr_345.md) See [IX, 1, 1,
6](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:6.md).

<span id="fn_340"></span>[201:4](sbe4334.htm#fr_346.md) ? Or, that
(firebrand) is indeed food (vâ*g*a). Mahîdhara interprets this part of
the formula thus: To thee do we give food (vâ*g*âya for vâ*g*am).

<span id="fn_341"></span>[201:5](sbe4334.htm#fr_347.md) See VI, 7, 2, 5
seq.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[203:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_348.md) Weber, Ind. Stud.
XIII, 281, takes 'kar*n*akavat' to mean 'one that has a knot-hole;' but
Deva's explanation, 'kar*n*ako dvitîya*s*âkhodbheda*h*,' probably means
nothing else than 'showing the appearance of a second branch,' or 'one
in which a second branch (side branch) has struck out.'

<span id="fn_343"></span>[205:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_349.md) See VI, 1, 1, 1
seq.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[206:1](sbe4334.htm#fr_350.md) See VII, 1, 2,
16-19.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[206:2](sbe4334.htm#fr_351.md) Literally, he was
not equal thereto that he should eat food.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[206:3](sbe4334.htm#fr_352.md) That is, the
*K*ityâgni (fire-altar) said to the Agni (fire) about to be led forward.
