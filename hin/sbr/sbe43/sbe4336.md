### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

##### THE SHOWER OF WEALTH AND OTHER OBLATIONS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:3:2:1">9:3:2:1</span></span>1.
Thereupon <span id="fr_359"></span>[1](#fn_353) he (the Sacrificer <span
id="fr_360"></span>[2](#fn_354)) offers the Vasor dhârâ. That whole Agni
has now been completed, and he is here the Vasu (good one): to that Vasu
the gods offered this shower (dhârâ), whence it is called 'Vasor
dhârâ <span id="fr_361"></span>[3](#fn_355);' and in like manner this
(Sacrificer) offers to him this shower, and gratifies him thereby.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:3:2:2">9:3:2:2</span></span>2. And,
again, as to why he offers the 'Vasor dhârâ;'--this is his (Agni's)
Abhisheka <span id="fr_362"></span>[4](#fn_356); for the

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

gods, having now completed him wholly and entirely, showered upon him
those wishes (or, objects of desire), this 'Vasor dhârâ;' and in like
manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has completed him wholly and
entirely, shower upon him those wishes, this 'Vasor dhârâ.' With ghee
taken in five ladlings, and an offering-ladle of udumbara wood (he
offers): the significance of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:3:2:3">9:3:2:3</span></span>3. \[He
offers it\] after offering the Vai*s*vânara (cake)--for the Vai*s*vânara
is the head, and food is taken in from the head. (downwards); and,
besides, it is from the head (downwards) that he who is anointed is
anointed;--and after offering the Mâruta (cakes), for the Mârutas are
the vital airs, and through (the channels of) the vital airs food is
eaten; and, besides, it is at (the openings of) the vital airs that he
who is anointed is anointed <span id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_357).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:3:2:4">9:3:2:4</span></span>4. And,
furthermore, (it is offered) upon the Ara*n*ye<sup>ऽ</sup>nû*k*ya <span
id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_358); for the Ara*n*ye<sup>ऽ</sup>nû*k*ya is
speech, and it is through (the channel of) speech that food is eaten;
and, besides, it is with speech that he who

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

is anointed is anointed. And everything here is wealth (vasu), for all
these (cake-offerings) are (connected with special) wishes <span
id="fr_365"></span>[1](#fn_359); and in order that this shower, be it of
milk or of ghee, (may be) fraught with wealth, this oblation of ghee is
thus offered for the beginning; and inasmuch as this shower is fraught
with wealth, it is called 'shower of wealth.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:3:2:5">9:3:2:5</span></span>5. He (as
it were) says, 'This is mine, and that is mine;'--that is, 'Herewith I
gratify thee, and therewith;--herewith I anoint thee, and therewith;'
or, 'Give me this, and that!' And as soon as that shower reaches the
fire, that prayer is fulfilled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:3:2:6">9:3:2:6</span></span>6. Now
the gods, having gratified him (Agni) by this food, or by these objects
of desire <span id="fr_366"></span>[2](#fn_360), and having anointed him
by this shower of wealth, solicited from him these objects of
desire <span id="fr_367"></span>[3](#fn_361); and having received
offering, and being gratified and anointed, he granted them these
objects of desire; and in like manner this (Sacrificer), having
gratified him by this food, and by these offerings of desire, and
anointed him with this shower of wealth, now solicits from him these
objects of desire; and having received offering, and being gratified and
anointed, he (Agni) grants him these objects of desire. In order to
avoid discontinuance, he each time embraces two wishes,--even as one
would connect those living away from one another,--thinking, 'In this
way shall they prosper by sacrifice!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:3:2:7">9:3:2:7</span></span>7. The
gods now spake, 'Through whom shall we receive these objects of desire?
By our own

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

self,' they said; for the sacrifice is the self of the gods, and so is
the sacrifice that of the Sacrificer; and when he says, 'By the
sacrifice they shall prosper!' he means to say, 'By my own self they
shall prosper!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:3:2:8">9:3:2:8</span></span>8. In
twelve (things) he causes them to prosper <span
id="fr_368"></span>[1](#fn_362), the year consists of twelve months, and
Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so
much food he thus gratifies him, and by so much food he thus consecrates
him. In fourteen he causes them to prosper; in eight he causes them to
prosper; in ten he causes them to prosper; in thirteen he causes them to
prosper.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:3:2:9">9:3:2:9</span></span>9. He
then offers the Ardhendra (libations) <span
id="fr_369"></span>[2](#fn_363);the ardhendras are everything here <span
id="fr_370"></span>[3](#fn_364): he thus gratifies him (Agni) with
everything, and with everything he thus consecrates him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:3:2:10">9:3:2:10</span></span>10. He
then offers (the libations relating to) the Grahas <span
id="fr_371"></span>[4](#fn_365);[](errata.htm#3)--the grahas (cups of
soma, offered to

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

the deities), doubtless, are sacrifice: by sacrifice, by food, he thus
gratifies him; and by sacrifice he thus consecrates him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_353"></span>[213:1](sbe4336.htm#fr_359) That is, after
offering all the seven Mâruta cakes, the formulas of the last six of
which (Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 81-85; XXXIX, 7) are not given in the Brâhma*n*a.
At the end the Adhvaryu mutters the verse XVII, 86, and thereupon he
either makes the Sacrificer mutter (or mutters himself) verses 87-99 in
praise of Agni. Kâty. *S*r. XVIII, 4, 25; 26.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[213:2](sbe4336.htm#fr_360) Thus, according to
Kâty. XVIII, 5, 1 (the Adhvaryu, according to Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p.
283).

<span id="fn_355"></span>[213:3](sbe4336.htm#fr_361) It would rather
seem to mean 'stream, or shower, of wealth;' cf. [paragraph
4](sbe4336.htm#9:3:2:4).

<span id="fn_356"></span>[213:4](sbe4336.htm#fr_362) That is, the
consecration ceremony, in which the king is sprinkled' with sacred
water, or, so to speak, anointed. The 'Vasor dhârâ,' or 'shower of
wealth,' consisting of an uninterrupted series of 401 libations to Agni
(through which all the powers of the god are to be secured to the
Sacrificer), is intended as the <span id="page_214">p. 214</span>
equivalent of that ceremony for the consecration of Agni as king; and,
indeed, as a kind of superior consecration ceremony for the (royal)
Sacrificer himself, more potent than the Râ*g*asûya and Vâ*g*apeya.
There is thus to be noticed here the same tendency as elsewhere of
exalting the efficacy of the Agni*k*ayana, and of making it take the
place of the whole of the ordinary sacrificial ceremonial.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[214:1](sbe4336.htm#fr_363) When anointed, or
consecrated, the king is first sprinkled from the front and then from
behind, and finally rubbed all over, with the consecrated water; see V,
4, 2, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_358"></span>[214:2](sbe4336.htm#fr_364) That is, as soon as
the Adhvaryu has put the Ara*n*ye<sup>ऽ</sup>nû*k*ya cake in the fire
the Sacrificer begins to pour the ghee on it with a large offering-ladle
of udumbara wood, and the Adhvaryu begins to mutter the formulas.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[215:1](sbe4336.htm#fr_365) Or, all these
(objects) for which offerings are made are objects of desire.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[215:2](sbe4336.htm#fr_366) Or, perhaps, 'for
(prompted by) these objects of desire.'

<span id="fn_361"></span>[215:3](sbe4336.htm#fr_367) Or, asked him these
wishes (boons).

<span id="fn_362"></span>[216:1](sbe4336.htm#fr_368) That is, he makes
the objects of desire mentioned in the formulas used during the Vasor
dhârâ, accrue to himself, or turn out well for himself. The formulas
usually contain the names of twelve such objects (in six pairs), those
in XVIII, 1 being--'(may) strength and gain, endeavour and attempt,
thought and wisdom, sound and praise, fame and hearing, light and
heaven, prosper for (or accrue to) me by sacrifice!' In XVIII, 4,
however, fourteen objects are enumerated, in XVIII, 15 (and 27) eight,
in XVIII, 23 (and 26). ten, in XVIII, 28 thirteen.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[216:2](sbe4336.htm#fr_369) Literally, 'the
half-Indra ones,' the technical term for the formulas of three sets of
libations (XVIII, 16-18), in which three sets of twelve deities are
named, each pair of whom consists of Indra coupled with some other
deity, thus 'May Agni and Indra, Soma and Indra, &c., prosper for (or
accrue to) me by sacrifice!'

<span id="fn_364"></span>[216:3](sbe4336.htm#fr_370) Viz. inasmuch as
Indra represents the ruling power, and everything submits to him (III,
9, 4, 15); or inasmuch as Indra and Agni are the whole universe (IV, 2,
2, 14).

<span id="fn_365"></span>[216:4](sbe4336.htm#fr_371) These are three
sets of libations (still forming part of the continuous <span
id="page_217">p. 217</span> 'Vasor dhârâ,' or 'wealth-stream'), the
formulas of which (XVIII, 19-21) enumerate each six pairs of cups of
Soma (graha) and of sacrificial implements.
