### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:5:1">10:4:5:1</span></span>1. Now
the doctrines of mystic imports <span id="fr_720"></span>[2](#fn_708.md).
The *S*âkâyanins hold that 'Agni is Vâyu (the wind);' but some say that
'Agni is Âditya (the sun).' And either *S*raumatya, or Hâliṅgava, said,
'Agni is no other than Vâyu: wherefore the Adhvaryu, when he performs
the last work <span id="fr_721"></span>[3](#fn_709.md), passes into that
(wind).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:5:2">10:4:5:2</span></span>2. And
*S*â*t*yâyani said, 'Agni is no other than the Year; his head is the
spring, his right wing the summer, his left wing the rainy season, his
middle body (trunk) the autumn season, and his tail and feet the winter
and dewy seasons--Agni is speech, Vâyu breath, the sun the eye, the moon
the mind, the quarters the ear, the generative power water <span
id="fr_722"></span>[4](#fn_710), the feet (and tail.md) fervour, the joints
the months, the veins the half-moons, the silver and gold feathers

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

the days and nights: thus he passes over to the gods.' Let him know,
then, that Agni is the Year; and let him know that it is thereof <span
id="fr_723"></span>[1](#fn_711.md) he consists.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:5:3">10:4:5:3</span></span>3. And
*K*elaka *S*â*nd*ilyâyana said, 'Let him know that the three layers
containing the naturally-perforated (bricks) <span
id="fr_724"></span>[2](#fn_712.md) are these worlds, that the fourth
(layer) is the Sacrificer, and the fifth all objects of desire; and that
it is these worlds, and his own self and all his objects of desire he
compasses.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_708"></span>[363:2](sbe4365.htm#fr_720.md) Athânantaram
upanishadâ*m* rahasyârthânâm âde*s*â upade*s*â vakshyante. Sây.--Prof.
Oldenberg (Zeitsch. of G. Or. S., 50, p. 457 seq.) takes 'upanishad' in
the sense of 'worship.'

<span id="fn_709"></span>[363:3](sbe4365.htm#fr_721.md) That is, the
concluding rites of the sacrifice,--tasmâd adhvaryu*h* yadâ uttama*m*
ya*gñ*asamâptilaksha*n*am karma karoti, tadaitam eva vâyum apyeti, tathâ
hi, samish*t*aya*g*urhome devâ gâtuvido gâtu*m* vittvâ gâtum ita
manasaspata iti mantre<sup>ऽ</sup>vâ*k*i, svâhâ vâte dhâ*h* svâhâ, iti
vâyau dhâra*n*am uktam. Sây. See IV, 4, 4, 53, where the sacrifice
(though not the Adhvaryu priest) is consigned to the wind by means of
the Samish*t*aya*g*us formulas.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[363:4](sbe4365.htm#fr_722.md) Note the change in
the relative position of subject and predicate from here.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[364:1](sbe4365.htm#fr_723.md) That is, of the
objects enumerated before.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[364:2](sbe4365.htm#fr_724.md) That is, the first,
third, and fifth layers. By the fourth and fifth layers mentioned
immediately after, we have not of course to understand the real fourth
and fifth layers, but the two making up the five layers (viz. the second
and fourth).
