### INTRODUCTION.

THE present volume completes the exposition of the Agni*k*ayana, or
construction of the sacred Fire-altar. Whilst to the general reader the
section of the Brâhma*n*a treating of this ceremony, and extending over
no less than five of its fourteen kâ*nd*as--or rather more than
one-third of the whole--will probably appear the least inviting part of
the work, a special interest attaches to this ceremony, and the dogmatic
explanation of its details, for the student of Indian antiquity. The
complicated ritual of the Fire-altar, as has been pointed out
before <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md), does not seem to have formed
part of the original sacrificial system, but was probably developed
independently of it, and incorporated with it at a comparatively recent
period. There seems, indeed, some reason to believe that it was
elaborated with a definite object in view, viz. that of making the
external rites and ceremonies of the sacrificial cult the practical
devotional expression of certain dominant speculative theories of the
time. As a matter of fact, the dogmatic exposition of no other part of
the sacrificial ceremonial reflects so fully and so faithfully as that
of the Agni*k*ayana those cosmogonic and theosophic theories which form
a characteristic feature of the Brâhma*n*a period. In the present work,
that section commences with a cosmogonic account so elaborate as is
hardly to be met with anywhere else in the Brâhma*n*a literature; and
throughout the course of performance the symbolic import of its details
is

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

explained here, as in other Brâhma*n*as, on the lines of those
cosmogonic speculations.

When, towards the close of the period represented by the Vedic hymns,
inquiring minds began to look beyond the elemental gods of the
traditional belief for some ulterior source of mundane life and
existence, the conception of a supreme, primordial being, the creator of
the universe, became the favourite topic of speculation. We accordingly
find different poets of that age singing of this uncreate being under
different names,--they call him Vi*s*vakarman, the 'All-worker'; or
Hira*n*yagarbha, the 'golden Embryo'; or Purusha, the 'Person'; or Ka,
the 'Who?; or the heavenly Gandharva Vi*s*vâvasu, 'All-wealth'; or
Pra*g*âpati, the 'Lord of Creatures.' Or they have recourse to a
somewhat older figure of the Pantheon, likewise of abstract conception,
and call him Brahma*n*aspati <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md), the Lord
of prayer or devotion; a figure which would naturally commend itself to
the priestly mind, and which, indeed, in a later phase of Hindu
religion, came to supply not only the name of the abstract, impersonal
form of the deity, the world-spirit, but also that of the first of its
three personal forms, the creator of the Hindu triad. Amongst these and
other names by which the supreme deity is thus designated in the
philosophic hymns of the *Ri*k and Atharva-veda, the name of
Pra*g*âpati, the Lord of Creatures or generation, plays a very important
part in the immediately succeeding period of literature, viz. that of
the Brâhma*n*as.

In the so-called Purusha-hymn (*Ri*g-veda X, 90), in which the supreme
spirit is conceived of as *th*e Person or Man (Purusha), born in the
beginning, and consisting of 'whatsoever hath been and whatsoever shall
be,' the creation of the visible and invisible universe is represented
as originating from an 'all-offered' sacrifice <span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2) (ya*gñ*a.md) in which the Purusha himself forms
the offering-material (havis), or, as one might

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

say, the victim. In this primeval--or rather timeless, because ever
proceeding--sacrifice, Time itself, in the shape of its unit, the Year,
is made to take its part, inasmuch as the three seasons, spring, summer,
and autumn, of which it consists, constitute the ghee, the
offering-fuel, and the oblation respectively. These speculations may be
said to have formed the foundation on which the theory of the sacrifice,
as propounded in the Brâhma*n*as, has been reared. Pra*g*âpati, who here
takes the place of the Purusha, the world-man, or all-embracing
Personality, is offered up anew in every sacrifice; and inasmuch as the
very dismemberment of the Lord of Creatures, which took place at that
archetypal sacrifice, was in itself the creation of the universe, so
every sacrifice is also a repetition of that first creative act. Thus
the periodical sacrifice is nothing else than a microcosmic
representation of the ever-proceeding destruction and renewal of all
cosmic life and matter. The theologians of the Brâhma*n*as go, however,
an important step further by identifying the performer, or patron, of
the sacrifice--the Sacrificer--with Pra*g*âpati; and it is this
identification which may perhaps furnish us with a clue to the reason
why the authors of the Brâhma*n*as came to fix upon 'Pra*g*âpati' as the
name of the supreme spirit. The name 'Lord of Creatures' is, no doubt,
in itself a perfectly appropriate one for the author of all creation and
generation; but seeing that the peculiar doctrine of the Purusha-sûkta
imparted such a decisive direction to subsequent dogmatic speculation,
it might seem rather strange that the name there chosen to designate the
supreme being should have been discarded, only to be employed
occasionally, and then mostly with a somewhat different
application <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md): On the other hand, the
term 'Pra*g*âpati' was manifestly a

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

singularly convenient one for the identification of the Sacrificer with
the supreme 'Lord of Creatures'; for, doubtless, men who could afford to
have great and costly sacrifices, such as those of the *S*rauta
ceremonial, performed for them--if they were not themselves Brâhmans, in
which case the term might not be inappropriate either--would almost
invariably be 'Lords of Creatures,' i.e. rulers of men and possessors of
cattle, whether they were mighty kings, or petty rulers, or landed
proprietors, or chiefs of clans. It may be remarked, in this respect,
that there is in the language of the Brâhma*n*as a constant play on the
word 'pra*g*â' (progenies), which in one place means creature' in
general, whilst in another it has the sense of 'people, subjects,' and
in yet another the even more restricted one of 'offspring or family.'

How far this identification of the human Sacrificer with the divine
Pra*g*âpati goes back, and whether, when first adopted, it was applied
at once to the whole of the sacrificial system, or whether it rather
originated with a certain restricted group of ritualists in connection
with some limited portion of the ceremonial such as the Agni*k*ayana,
and became subsequently part and parcel of the sacrificial theory, it
would probably not be easy to determine. As regards the symbolic
connection of the Sacrificer himself with the sacrifice, there can at
any rate be no doubt that it was an essential and an intimate one from
the very beginning of the sacrificial practice. When a man offers to the
gods their favourite food, it is in order to please them and to gain
some special object of his own,--either to make them strong and inclined
for fighting his battles, and to secure their help for some undertaking
of his or against some danger by which he is threatened; or to deprecate
their wrath at some offence he knows or fancies he has committed against
them; or to thank them for past favours, with an eye, it may be, to new
and still greater favours to come. Gradually, however, the connection
becomes a subtler and more mystic one; the notion of substitution enters
into the sacrifice: it is in lieu of his own self that man makes the

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

offering. This notion is a familiar one to the theologians of the
Brâhma*n*as, either in the sense that the oblation is sent up to the
gods in order to prepare the way for the Sacrificer, and secure a place
for him in heaven; or in the sense that along with the burnt-offering
the human body of the Sacrificer is mystically consumed, and a new,
divine body prepared to serve him in the celestial abodes. Intimately
connected with this latter notion we find another, introduced rather
vaguely, which makes the sacrifice a mystic union in which the
Sacrificer generates from out of the Vedi (f.), or altar-ground, his
future, divine self. In this respect Agni, the offering-fire, also
appears as the mate of Vedi <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md); but it
will be seen that Agni himself is but another form of the divine and the
human Pra*g*âpati.

With the introduction of the Pra*g*âpati theory into the sacrificial
metaphysics, theological speculation takes a higher flight, developing
features not unlike, in some respects, to those of Gnostic philosophy.
From a mere act of piety, and of practical, if mystic, significance to
the person, or persons, immediately concerned, the sacrifice--in the
esoteric view of the metaphysician, at least--becomes an event of cosmic
significance. By offering up his own self in sacrifice, Pra*g*âpati
becomes dismembered; and all those separated limbs and faculties of his
come to form the universe,--all that exists, from the gods and Asuras
(the children of Father Pra*g*âpati) down to the worm, the blade of
grass, and the smallest particle of inert matter. It requires a new, and
ever new, sacrifice to build the dismembered Lord of Creatures up again,
and restore him so as to enable him to offer himself up again and again,
and renew the universe, and thus keep up the uninterrupted revolution of
time and matter. The idea of the dismembered Pra*g*âpati, and of this or
that sacrificial act being required to complete and replenish him,
occurs throughout the lucubrations of the Brâhma*n*as; but in the
exposition of the ordinary forms of sacrifice, this element can hardly
be considered as

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

one of vital importance; whilst in the Agni*k*ayana, on the contrary, it
is of the very essence of the whole performance. Indeed, it seems to me
by no means unlikely that the Purusha-Pra*g*âpati dogma was first
practically developed in connection with the ceremony of the
Fire-altar <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md), and that, along with the
admission of the latter into the regular sacrificial ceremonial, it was
worked into the sacrificial theory generally. In the Agni*k*ayana
section (Kâ*nd*as VI-X), as has already been stated <span
id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md), *S*â*nd*ilya is referred to as the chief
authority in doctrinal matters, whilst in the remaining portions of the
Brâhma*n*a, that place of honour is assigned to Yâ*gñ*avalkya. Now, it
may be worthy of notice, in connection with this question of the
Pra*g*âpati dogma, that in the list of successive teachers <span
id="fr_7"></span>[3](#fn_7.md) appended to the Agni*k*ayana section, the
transmission of the sacrificial science--or rather of the science of the
Fire-altar, for the list can only refer to that section--is traced from
*S*â*nd*ilya upwards to Tura Kâvasheya, who is stated to have received
it from Pra*g*âpati; the Lord of Creatures, on his part, having received
it from the (impersonal) Brahman. Does not this look almost like a
distinct avowal of *S*â*nd*ilya and his spiritual predecessors being
answerable for having introduced the doctrine of the identity of
Pra*g*âpati and the sacrifice into the sacrificial philosophy? If such
he the case, the adaptation of this theory to the dogmatic explanation
of the other parts of the ceremonial, as far as the
*S*atapatha-Brâhma*n*a is concerned, might be supposed to have been
carried out about the time of Sa*mg*ivî-putra, when the union of the two
lines of teachers seems to have taken place <span
id="fr_8"></span>[4](#fn_8.md). But seeing that the tenth Kâ*nd*a, called
the Mystery, or secret doctrine, of the Fire-altar, was apparently not
at first included in the sacrificial canon of the

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Vâ*g*asaneyins <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md), the mystic
speculations in which that section so freely indulges would seem to have
been left apart from the regular canon, along with other floating
material which was not considered suitable for practical purposes, or
indispensable for an intelligent appreciation of the hidden import of
the sacrificial rites.

Once granted that the real purport of all, sacrificial performances is
the restoration of the dismembered Lord of Creatures, and the
reconstruction of the All, it cannot be denied that, of all ceremonial
observances, the building of the great Fire-altar was the one most
admirably adapted for this grand symbolic purpose. The very magnitude of
the structure;--nay, its practically illimitable extent <span
id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10.md), coupled with the immense number of single
objects--mostly bricks of various kinds--of which it is composed, cannot
but offer sufficiently favourable conditions for contriving what might
fairly pass for a miniature representation of at least the visible
universe. The very name 'Agni,' by which the Fire-altar is invariably
designated, indicates from the very outset an identification of cardinal
importance--that of Pra*g*âpati with Agni, the god of fire, and the
sacrifice. It is a natural enough identification; for, as Pra*g*âpati is
the arch-sacrificer, so Agni is the divine sacrificer, the priest of the
sacrifice. hence the constantly occurring triad--Pra*g*âpati, Agni, and
(the human) Sacrificer. The identity of the altar and the sacred fire
which is ultimately to be placed thereon is throughout insisted upon.
Side by side with the forming and baking of the bricks for the altar
takes place the process of shaping and baking the fire-pan (ukhâ).
During the year over which the building of the altar is spread, the
sacred fire is carried about in the pan by the Sacrificer for a certain
time each day. In the same way as the layers of the altar are arranged
so as to represent earth, air, and heaven, so the fire-pan is fashioned
in such a way as to be a miniature copy of the three worlds <span
id="fr_11"></span>[3](#fn_11.md). But, while this identity is never lost
sight of, it is not an absolute

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

one, but rather one which seems to hold good only for this special
sacrificial performance. Though it may be that we have to look upon this
identification as a serious attempt to raise Agni, the divine priest, to
the position of a supreme deity, the creator of the universe, such a
design seems nowhere to be expressed in clear and unmistakeable terms.
Nor are the relations between the two deities always defined
consistently. Pra*g*âpati is *th*e god above all other gods; he is the
thirty-fourth god, and includes all the gods (which Agni does likewise);
he is the three worlds as well as the fourth world beyond them <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md). Whilst, thus, he is the universe, Agni is
the child of the universe, the (cosmic). waters being the womb from
which he springs <span id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md). Whence a
lotus-leaf is placed at the bottom of the fire-altar to represent the
waters and the womb from which Agni-Pra*g*âpati and the human Sacrificer
are to be born. Agni is both the father and the son of Pra*g*âpati:
'inasmuch as Pra*g*âpati created Agni, he is Agni's father; and inasmuch
as Agni restored him, Agni is his father <span
id="fr_14"></span>[3](#fn_14.md).' Yet the two are separate; for
Pra*g*âpati covets Agni's forms,--forms (such as Î*s*âna, the lord;
Mahan Deva*h*, the great god; Pa*s*upati, the lord of beasts) which are
indeed desirable enough for a supreme Lord of Creatures to possess, and
which might well induce Pra*g*âpati to take up Agni within his own self.
Though, in accordance with an older conception, Agni is still the light
or regent of the earth, as Vâyu, the wind, is that of the air, and the
sun that of the heavens; it is now explained that really these are but
three forms of the one Agni,--that Agni's splendour in heaven is Âditya,
that in the air Vâyu, and that on earth the (sacrificial) fire <span
id="fr_15"></span>[4](#fn_15.md). When Pra*g*âpati is dismembered, Agni
takes unto himself the escaping fiery spirit of the god; and when he is
set up again, Agni becomes the right arm, as Indra becomes the left one,
of the Lord of Creatures. Upon the whole, however, the peculiar
relations between the two gods may perhaps be defined best in accordance
with the

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

passage already referred to:--Agni is created by Pra*g*âpati, and he
subsequently restores Pra*g*âpati by giving up his own body (the
fire-altar) to build up anew the dismembered Lord of Creatures, and by
entering into him with his own fiery spirit,--'whence, while being
Pra*g*âpati, they yet call him Agni.'

The shape adopted for the altar is that of some large bird--probably an
eagle or a falcon--flying towards the east, the gate of heaven. Not that
this is the form in which Pra*g*âpati is invariably conceived. On the
contrary, he is frequently imagined in the form of a man, and symbolic
features are often applied to him which could only fit, or would best
fit, a human body. But, being the embodiment of all things, Pra*g*âpati
naturally possesses all forms; whence the shape of a four-footed animal
is likewise occasionally applied to the altar <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md). It was, doubtless, both traditional
imagery and practical considerations which told in favour of the shape
actually chosen. Pra*g*âpati is the sacrifice and the food of the
gods <span id="fr_17"></span>[2](#fn_17.md); and Soma, the drink of
immortality and at the same time the Moon, is *the* divine food or
offering κατ᾽ ἐξοχήν, the uttama*m* havis <span
id="fr_18"></span>[3](#fn_18.md), or paramâhuti <span
id="fr_19"></span>[4](#fn_19.md), or supreme oblation: hence Pra*g*âpati is
Soma <span id="fr_20"></span>[5](#fn_20.md). But Soma was brought down from
heaven by the bird-shaped Gâyatrî; and the sacrifice itself is fashioned
like a bird <span id="fr_21"></span>[6](#fn_21.md). In one passage <span
id="fr_22"></span>[7](#fn_22.md), certain authorities are referred to as
making the altar (Agni) take the form of a bird in order to carry the
Sacrificer to heaven; but the author himself there insists dogmatically
on the traditional connection of the altar with Pra*g*âpati: that it was
by assuming that form that the vital airs became Pra*g*âpati <span
id="fr_23"></span>[8](#fn_23.md); and that in that

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

form he created the gods who, on their part, became immortal by assuming
the birdlike form--and apparently flying up to heaven, which would seem
to imply that the Sacrificer himself is to fly up to heaven in form of
the bird-shaped altar, there to become immortal. It is not, however,
only with the Moon, amongst heavenly luminaries, that Pra*g*âpati is
identified, but also with the Sun; for the latter, as we have seen, is
but one of the three forms of Agni, and the fire on the great altar is
itself the Sun <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md); whilst the notion of
the sun being fashioned like a bird flying through space is not an
unfamiliar one to the poets of the Vedic age. More familiar, however, to
the authors of the Brâhma*n*as, as it is more in keeping with the mystic
origin of Pra*g*âpati, is the identification of the latter, not with the
solar orb itself, but with the man (purusha) in the sun, the real
shedder of light and life. This gold man plays an important part in the
speculations of the Agnirahasya <span id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25.md),
where he is represented as identical with the man (purusha) in the
(right) eye--the individualised Purusha, as it were; whilst his
counterpart in the Fire-altar is the solid gold man (purusha) laid down,
below the centre of the first layer, on a gold plate, representing the
sun, lying itself on the lotus-leaf already referred to as the womb
whence Agni springs. And this gold man in the altar, then, is no other
than Agni-Pra*g*âpati and the Sacrificer: above him--in the first,
third, and fifth layers--lie the three naturally-perforated bricks,
representing the three worlds through which he will have to pass on his
way to the fourth, invisible, world, the realm of immortal life. We thus
meet here again with the hallowed, old name of the Lord of Being, only
to be made use of for new mystic combinations.

As the personified totality of all being, Pra*g*âpati, however, not only
represents the phenomena and aspects of space, but also those of
time,--he is Father Time. But just as, in the material process of
building up the Fire-altar, the infinite dimensions of space require to
be reduced to

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

finite proportions, so, in regard to time, the year, as the lowest
complete revolution of time, is taken to represent the Lord of
Creation:--he is Father Year; and accordingly Agni, the Fire-altar,
takes a full year to complete. And, in the same way, Agni, the
sacrificial fire, from the time of his being generated in the fire-pan,
as the womb, requires to be carried about by the Sacrificer for a whole
year, to be matured by him before the child Agni can be born and placed
on the Fire-altar. The reason why the Sacrificer must do so is, of
course, that Agni, being the child of the universe--that is of
Pra*g*âpati and the Sacrificer,--the latter, at the time when the fire
is kindled in the fire-pan, has, as it were, to take Agni within his own
self <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md), and has afterwards to produce
him from out of his own self when mature.

But whilst, in regard to Agni-Pra*g*âpati, the year during which the
altar is erected represents the infinitude of time, to the mortal
Sacrificer it will not be so until he shall have departed this life;
and, as a rule, he would probably not be anxious there and then to end
his earthly career. Nor is such an effort of renunciation demanded of
him, but, on the contrary, the sacrificial theory holds out to the pious
performer of this holy ceremony the prospect of his living up to the
full extent of the perfect man's life, a hundred years; this term of
years being thus recognised as another unit of time, so to speak, viz.
that of a complete lifetime. Yet, be it sooner or be it later, the life
of every creature comes to an end; and since time works its havoc on all
material existence, and carries off generation after generation, the
Supreme Lord of generation, Father Time, as he is the giver of all life,
so he is likewise that ender of all things--Death. And so the
Sacrificer, as the human counterpart of the Lord of Creatures, with the
end of his present life, becomes himself Death,--Death ceases to have
power over him, and he is for ever removed from the life of material
existence, trouble, and illusion, to the realms of light and everlasting
bliss.

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

And here we get the Supreme Lord in his last aspect; nay, his one true
and real aspect, in which the Sacrificer will himself come to
share,--that of pure intellectuality, pure spirituality;--he is Mind:
such is the ultimate source of being, the one Self, the Purusha, the
Brahman. The author of the Mystery of Agni attempts to reveal the
process of evolution by which this one true Self, through sacrifice
carried on by means of the Arka-fires of his own innate fervour and
devotion, comes to manifest himself in the material universe; and--as
the sum total of the wisdom of *S*â*nd*ilya--he urges upon the searcher
after truth to meditate on that Self, made up of intelligence, and
endowed with a body of spirit, a form of light, and an etherial nature,
. . . holding sway over all the regions and pervading this All, being
itself speechless and devoid of mental affects;--and bids him believe
that 'even as a grain of rice, or the smallest granule of millet, so is
the golden Purusha in the heart; even as a smokeless light, it is
greater than the sky, greater than the ether, greater than the earth,
greater than all existing things; that Self of the spirit is my Self: on
passing away from hence I shall obtain that Self. Aid, verily, whosoever
has this trust, for him there is no uncertainty.'

As the practical application of the Agni-Pra*g*âpati mystery to the
sacrificial ritual consists mainly in the erection of the Fire-altar and
the ceremonies connected with the fire-pan, which fell almost entirely
within the province of the Adhvaryu priest, it is naturally in his
text-books, in the Ya*g*ur-veda, that the mystic theory has become fully
elaborated. Yet, though the two other classes of priests, the Hot*ri*s
and Udgât*ri*s <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md), take, upon the
whole, a comparatively subsidiary part in the year's performance
symbolising the reconstruction of the Lord of Creatures, they have found
another solemn opportunity, subsequently to the completion of the
Fire-altar, for making up for any

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

shortcomings in this respect, viz. the Mahâvrata, or Great Rite.

The brick altar, when complete, might apparently be used at once for any
kind of Soma-sacrifice <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md); but whether,
if this were to be merely a one-day performance, it might be made a
Mahâvrata day (in which case it must be an Agnish*t*oma), seems somewhat
doubtful <span id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29.md). As a rule, however, at any
rate, the Mahâvrata was performed in connection, not with an ekâha or
ahîna, but with a sacrificial session (sattra); and since sacrificial
sessions, it would seem, could only be undertaken by Brâhmans who would
at the same time be the Sacrificers--or rather G*ri*hapatis (masters of
the house or householders) as the Sattrins are called--and their own
officiating priests, the Mahâvrata would thus generally, if not
invariably, be reserved for Brâhmans <span
id="fr_30"></span>[3](#fn_30.md). Indeed, in our Brâhma*n*a (IX, 5, 2,
12-13) the rule is laid down that no one may officiate for another
person at the Agni*k*ayana, the Mahâvrata (sâman), and the Mahad Uktham;
and dire consequences are predicted in the case of any one who does so;
'for, indeed, these (rites) are his divine, immortal body; and he who
performs them for another person, makes over to another his divine body,
and a withered trunk is all that remains.' And, though other authorities
are then referred to who merely prescribe, as a penance for those who
have officiated at these ceremonies for others, that they should either
perform them for themselves or cause others to perform them again, the
author

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

adheres to his opinion that there is no atonement for such an offence.
There can be no doubt, however, that the Agni*k*ayana, at any rate, was
not restricted to the Brâhma*n*ical order <span
id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md); and this passage, if it does not merely
record a former sacrificial practice, has probably to be understood in
the sense that one must not officiate for another at an. Agni*k*ayana
which is to be followed by a Soma-sacrifice with the Mahâvrata. If the
Sattra performed was one of the shortest kind, viz. a Dvâda*s*âha, or
twelve days’ performance--consisting of a Da*s*arâtra, preceded and
followed by an Atirâtra--the Mahâvrata was inserted, it would seem,
between the Da*s*arâtra and the final Atirâtra. Usually, however, the
Sattra, like the Agni*k*ayana, lasted a full year; the favourite form
being the 'Gavâm ayanam,' arranged, in accordance with the progress of
the sun, in two halves, an ascending and a descending one, divided by a
central day, the Vishuvat. The Mahâvrata was performed on the last day
but one of the year, the day before the final Atirâtra, being itself
preceded (as it was in the case of the Dvâda*s*âha) by a Da*s*arâtra, or
ten days’ performance. Now, the chief feature of the Mahâvrata day is
the chanting,--in connection with a special cup of Soma-juice, the
Mahâvratîya-graha--of the Mahâvrata-sâman <span
id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md), as the Hot*ri*'s P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra at
the midday service; this chant being followed by the recitation of the
Mahad Uktham <span id="fr_33"></span>[3](#fn_33.md), or Great Litany, by
the Hot*ri*. The special feature, however, of these two ceremonies,
which recalls the mystic Agni-Pra*g*âpati doctrine, is the supposed
birdlike form of both the chant and the litany. The Lord of Creatures,
as the embodiment of all things, also represents the 'trayî vidyâ,' or
sacred threefold science, the Veda. Accordingly, the Stomas (hymn-forms)

verses) composing the Stotra or hymn of praise (the Mahâvrata-sâman), on
the one hand, and the verses and metres of the recited litany, on the
other, are so arranged and explained as to make up the different parts
of a bird's body. It need scarcely be remarked that, whilst in the case
of the altar the task of bringing out at least a rough resemblance to a
flying bird offered no great difficulties, it is altogether beyond the
capabilities of vocal performances such as the chant and the recitation
of hymns and detached verses. But the very fact that this symbolism is
only a matter of definition and make-believe makes it all the more
characteristic of the great hold which the Pra*g*âpati theory had gained
upon the sacerdotal mind.

The question as to whether these compositions themselves might seem to
show any signs of comparatively recent introduction of this symbolism
requires further investigation before it can be answered. Of the
Mahâvrata-sâman we have virtually a single version, with only
indications of certain substitutions which may be made in the choice of
texts and tunes; the parts of the bird's body represented by the single
Sâmans being in the order--head, right wing, left wing, tail, and trunk.
Of the Mahad Uktham, on the other hand, we possess two different
versions, those of the Aitareya and the *S*âṅkhâyana schools of
*Ri*g-veda theologians. Both of them start with the hymns representing
the trunk of the bird; but otherwise there is so marked a difference
between them, both as to arrangement and the choice of verses and hymns,
that it seems pretty clear that, whilst there must have existed already
a certain traditional form of the litany when these two schools
separated, it was not yet of a sufficiently settled character to prevent
such serious discrepancies to arise as those exhibited by the two
rituals. This point being, however, of too technical a nature to be
entered upon in this place, its further investigation must be reserved
for some other opportunity.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[xv:1](sbe4302.htm#fr_3.md) In its original sense it
occurs at the beginning of the Agni*k*ayana section, VI, 1, 1, 2-3, in
connection with what might almost be regarded as an exposition of the
Purusha-sûkta. The seven original purushas out of which *the* Purusha
comes to be compacted, are apparently intended to account for the
existence of the seven *Ri*shis (explained in the Brâhma*n*as as
representing the vital airs) prior to the creation of the one Purusha.
It would seem that they themselves previously composed the as yet
uncorporeal Purusha.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[xxi:8](sbe4302.htm#fr_23.md) This can only refer
to the cosmological statement at the beginning of the same Kâ*nd*a,
where the seven *Ri*shis, or vital airs, are said to have combined to
form the bird-shaped Purusha or Pra*g*âpati. Though nothing is said
there of their having themselves been shaped like birds, this might
perhaps be inferred from the use of the term 'purusha' with reference to
them. In the Purusha-sûkta nothing whatever is said of a birdlike form,
either in regard to the *Ri*shis, <span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span> or
the Purusha; the latter being on the contrary, imagined in the form of a
gigantic man.

however, in such ceremonies as the doing homage to the completed
Fire-altar by means of the Parimâds; cf. [p. 288](sbe4346.htm#page_288.md),
note [2](sbe4346.htm#fn_534.md) of this volume.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[xxv:1](sbe4302.htm#fr_28.md) Our Brâhma*n*a, X, 2,
5, 16, says that, if a man cannot press Soma for a year, he should
perform the Vi*s*va*g*it Atirâtra with all the P*ri*sh*th*as, and at
that performance he should give away all his property. These, however,
were doubtless by no means the only alternatives.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[xxv:2](sbe4302.htm#fr_29.md) See, however,
Sâya*n*a on Ait. Âr. V, 1, s, 1, where it is distinctly stated that the
Mahâvrata may either be performed as an Ekâha, or as part of either an
Ahîna, or a Sattra.--Kâtyâyana, XVI, s, 2, lays down the rule that
(though the building of an altar is not a necessary condition for the
performance of a Soma-sacrifice) it is indispensable in the case of a
Soma-sacrifice performed. with the Mahâvrata.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[xxv:3](sbe4302.htm#fr_30.md) That is to say, as
Sacrificers. Persons of other castes of course took part in the
proceedings of this day. In the various accounts of these proceedings,
no alternative ceremonies seem anywhere referred to in case the
Sacrificers themselves belong to different castes.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[xxvi:1](sbe4302.htm#fr_31.md) See, for instance,
Sat. Br. VI, 6, 3, 12-15, where directions are given as to certain
alternatives of performance at the initiation ceremony in case the
Sacrificer is either a Kshatriya, or a Purohita, or any other person.
The ceremonies connected with the consecration of the Sacrificer ([IX,
3, 4, 1](sbe4338.htm#9:3:4:1) seqq..md) point chiefly to a king.
