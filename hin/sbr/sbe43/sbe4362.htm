This Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, the year, has created all existing things, both what breathes and the breathless, both gods and men.

That one (the sun) bakes everything here, by means of the days and nights, the half-moons, the months, the seasons, and the year; and this (Agni, the fire) bakes what is baked by that one: 'A baker of the baked (he is),' said Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a of Agni; 'for he bakes what has been baked by that (sun).'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:4:2:20">10:4:2:20</A></FONT></span>20. In the year these (muh&ucirc;rtas) amounted to ten thousand and eight hundred: he stopped at the ten thousand and eight hundred.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:4:2:21">10:4:2:21</A></FONT></span>21. He then looked round over all existing things, and beheld all existing things in the threefold lore (the Veda), for therein is the body of all metres, of all stomas, of all vital airs, and of all the gods: this, indeed, exists, for it is immortal, and what is immortal exists; and this (contains also) that which is mortal.</p>

<p>verses created by Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. At-the thirtieth arrangement they came to an end in the Pa&#7749;ktis; and because it was at the thirtieth arrangement that they came to an end, there are thirty nights in the month; and because it was in the Pa&#7749;ktis, therefore Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is 'p&acirc;&#7749;kta' (fivefold)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_697"></A><A HREF="#fn_686"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.

He then arranged the two other Vedas into twelve thousand B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;s,--eight (thousand) of the Ya<I>g</I>us (formulas), and four of the S&acirc;man (hymns)--for of that extent is what was created by Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati in these two Vedas. At the thirtieth arrangement these two came to an end in the Pa&#7749;ktis; and because it was at the thirtieth arrangement that they came to an end, there are thirty nights in the month; and because it was in the Pa&#7749;ktis, therefore Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is 'p&acirc;&#7749;kta.' There were one hundred-and-eight hundred&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_699"></A><A HREF="#fn_687"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Pa&#7749;ktis.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:4:2:25">10:4:2:25</A></FONT></span>25.

In the course of a half-moon the first body was made up, in a further (half-moon) the next (body), in a further one the next,--in a year he is made up whole and complete.</p>

In this manner he put this threefold lore into his own self, and made it his own; and in this very (performance) he became the body of all existing things, (a body) composed of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities; and having become composed of all that, he ascended upwards; and he who thus ascended is that moon yonder.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:4:2:29">10:4:2:29</A></FONT></span>29. Now when he (the Sacrificer), being about to build an altar, undergoes the initiation-rite,--even as Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati poured his own self, as seed, into the fire-pan as the womb,--so does he pour into the fire-pan, as seed into the womb, his own self composed of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities. In the course of a half-moon, his first body is made up, in a further (half-moon) the next (body), in a further one the next,--in a year he is made up whole and complete.</p>

And whenever he lays down an enclosing-stone, he lays down a night, and along with that fifteen muh&ucirc;rtas, and along with the muh&ucirc;rtas fifteen eighties (of syllables). And whenever he lays down a Ya<I>g</I>ushmat&icirc; (brick), he lays down a day, and along with that fifteen muh&ucirc;rtas, and along with the muh&ucirc;rtas fifteen eighties (of syllables of the sacred texts). In this manner he puts this threefold lore into his own self, and makes it his own; and in this very (performance) he becomes the body of all existing things, (a body) composed of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities; and having become composed of all that, he ascends upwards.</p>

<p>he who knows this departs from this world, then he passes into that body composed of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities; and verily having become composed of all that, he who, knowing this performs this sacrificial work, or he who even knows it, ascends upwards.</p>
