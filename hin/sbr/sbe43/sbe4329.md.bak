### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:1">8:7:4:1</span></span>1. On the
(three) naturally-perforated (bricks) he (the Sacrificer) sings sâmans;
for the naturally-perforated ones are these (three) worlds; and they

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

are just these (ordinary) stones. The gods, having laid them down, saw
them as such: that they were dry stones.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:2">8:7:4:2</span></span>2. They
spake, 'Think ye upon this, how we may lay sap, the means of
subsistence, into these worlds!' They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby,
doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! seek ye how we may lay
sap, the means of subsistence, into these worlds!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:3">8:7:4:3</span></span>3. Whilst
meditating, they saw these sâmans (hymn-tunes), and sang them; and by
means of them they laid sap, the means of subsistence, into these
worlds; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, when he sings these
sâmans, lay sap, the means of subsistence, into these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:4">8:7:4:4</span></span>4. Over
the naturally-perforated ones he sings them: the naturally-perforated
ones being these worlds, it is into these worlds that he thereby lays
sap, the means of subsistence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:5">8:7:4:5</span></span>5. He
sings (the tunes) on the (mystic) words 'Bhûs, Bhuvas, Svar';--bhûs
(earth), doubtless, is this world, bhuvas is the air-world, and svar
(light) is yonder world: into these worlds he thereby lays sap, the
means of subsistence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:6">8:7:4:6</span></span>6. They
have different preludes, and the same finale <span
id="fr_256"></span>[1](#fn_255.md); and as to their having different
preludes, it

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

is because they (the gods) saw them separately; and as to their having
the same finale (nidhana), it is because there is only one foundation,
only one finale to the sacrifice--even heaven: therefore they have
'svar-*g*yotis (heaven-light)' for their finale.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:7">8:7:4:7</span></span>7. He
then bestrews him (Agni, the fire-altar and Agni's body) with chips of
gold. Now that whole Agni had been completed, and the gods bestowed on
him immortality, that highest form; and in like manner does this one now
bestow upon him that highest, immortal form <span
id="fr_257"></span>[1](#fn_256.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:8">8:7:4:8</span></span>8. And,
again, as to why he bestrews him with chips of gold. Now on that former
occasion he first lays into him that pleasing form, the gold plate and
the (gold) man <span id="fr_258"></span>[2](#fn_257.md); and he now decks
him all over with a pleasing form.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:9">8:7:4:9</span></span>9. With
two hundred (chips he bestrews him) each time,--two-footed is the
Sacrificer, and Agni

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

is the sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with
so much he thus bestows upon him immortality, that highest form. Five
times (he strews),--five-layered is the altar, five seasons make a year,
and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,
with so much he thus bestows upon him immortality, that highest form.
With a thousand (chips he bestrews him),--a thousand means everything:
with everything he thus confers upon him immortality, that highest form.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:10">8:7:4:10</span></span>10.
First (he scatters them) at the back whilst standing with his face
towards the east; then on the left (north) side towards the south; then
in front whilst facing the west; then, having gone round the back, from
the south whilst facing the north: this is from left to right (sunwise),
for that is (the way) with the gods. Then, having gone round, (he
scatters chips) at the back whilst standing with his face to the east,
for in this way that former performance of him <span
id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_258.md) took place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:11">8:7:4:11</span></span>11.
\[He scatters, with, Vâ*g*. S. XV, 65\], 'The fore-measure of a thousand
thou art,--The counter-measure of a thousand thou art,--The up-measure
of a thousand thou art,--The thousandfold thou art,--For a thousand
thee!'--a thousand, doubtless, means everything: thus, 'Everything thou
art,--thee for everything!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:12">8:7:4:12</span></span>12.
Now, then, the consideration of the layer-fillings. The first layer is
this (terrestrial) world; and the filling of soil means cattle: thus, in

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

covering the first layer with a filling of soil he covers this
(terrestrial) world with cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:13">8:7:4:13</span></span>13. The
second layer is the air, and the filling of soil means birds: thus, in
covering the second layer with a filling of soil, he covers (fills) the
air with birds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:14">8:7:4:14</span></span>14. The
third layer is the sky, and the filling of soil means stars; thus, in
covering the third layer with a filling of soil, he covers the sky with
stars.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:15">8:7:4:15</span></span>15. The
fourth layer is the sacrifice, and the filling of soil means sacrificial
gifts: thus, in covering the fourth layer with a filling of soil, he
covers the sacrifice with sacrificial gifts (to the priests).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:16">8:7:4:16</span></span>16. The
fifth layer is the Sacrificer, and the filling of soil means progeny (or
subjects) thus, in covering the fifth layer with a filling of soil, he
covers (abundantly supplies) the Sacrificer with progeny (or subjects).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:17">8:7:4:17</span></span>17. The
sixth layer is the heavenly world, and the filling of soil means the
gods: thus in covering the sixth layer with a filling of soil, he fills
the heavenly world with gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:18">8:7:4:18</span></span>18. The
seventh layer is immortality,--that is the last (layer) he lays down,
and thus bestows immortality as the highest thing of all this
(universe): therefore immortality is the highest thing of all this
(universe); therefore the gods are not separated therefrom; and
therefore they are immortal. Thus much as to the deity <span
id="fr_260"></span>[1](#fn_259.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:19">8:7:4:19</span></span>19.
Now, as to the Self (body). The first layer is the legs, and the
downward flowing vital air; and

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

the filling of soil is the flesh: thus, in covering the first layer with
a filling of soil, he covers that (part) of his (Agni's) body with
flesh. \[He does so\] after laying down bricks, and bricks mean bone: he
thus covers the bone with flesh. He does not cover (the altar-site)
below (the first layer), whence these vital airs are not closed up
below; but, he covers it above, and thereby covers that (part) of his
body above with flesh; and hence that (part) of his body above, being
covered with flesh, is not visible.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:20">8:7:4:20</span></span>20. The
second layer is that (part of the body) which is above the legs and
below the waist; and the filling of soil is flesh: thus, in covering the
second layer with a filling of soil, he covers that (part) of his body
with flesh. \[He does so\] after laying down bricks, and bricks mean
bone: he thus covers the bone with flesh. He places them on a filling of
soil, and covers them with a filling of soil: he thus covers that (part)
of his body on both sides with flesh; whence that part of his body,
being on both sides covered with flesh, is not visible.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:4:21">8:7:4:21</span></span>21. The
third layer is the waist itself; the fourth layer is that (part of the
body) which is above the waist and below the neck; the fifth layer is
the neck, the sixth layer is the head, and the seventh layer is the
vital airs. This he lays down as the last (or highest): he thus makes
the vital airs the highest of all this (universe), and hence the vital
airs are the highest thing of all this (universe). He places it on a
filling of soil; and the filling of soil means flesh; he thus covers
(the channels of) the vital airs with flesh. He does not cover it above,
whence these (channels of the) vital airs are not closed up above.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_255"></span>[145:1](sbe4329.htm#fr_256.md) These hymn-tunes
are given, Sam. Ved. V, p. 487, in the way in which they are here to be
chanted. They consist entirely of the respective words, separated four
times by musical interjections (stobhas) inserted between them, ending
with the common finale: thus, (r)
bhû*h*--bhû*h*--hoyi--bhû*h*--hoyi--bhû*h*--hâ\~ûvâ\~e--suvar*g*yotî\~*h*;
(2) bhuvâ*h*--bhuva*h*--hoyi--bhuva*h*--hâ\~ûvâ\~e--suvar*g*yotî\~*h*;
(3)
suvâ*h*--suva*h*--hoyi--suva*h*--hoyi--suva*h*--hâ\~ûvâ\~e--suvar*g*yotî\~*h*.
Along with these, as to be chanted on the same model, are given, (4) the
'satya*m* sâman,' beginning 'satyâm--satyam--hoyi' &c., and <span
id="page_146">p. 146</span> (5) the 'purusha-sâman,' beginning
'purushâ*h*--purusha--hoyi' &c.; which are similarly chanted by the
Sacrificer at the beginning of the first layer, when laying down the
lotus leaf (part iii, p. 363, where note 1 should be corrected in
accordance with the present note), and the gold man (ib. p. 369, where
the note requires likewise to be corrected), as the '*k*itre gâyati,'
'he sings on the bright one,' of the text cannot refer to the
'*K*itra-sâman' there referred to. Cf. Lâ*t*y. S. I, 5, 8.--In regard to
these sâmans (hymn-verses), the text might lead one to suppose that they
only consist of two, instead of the usual four parts (omitting the
intermediate Udgîtha and Pratihâra, cf. part ii, p. 310 note). The sâman
being, however, sung by the Sacrificer himself, the usual distinction
into parts to be performed by different chanters was probably dispensed
with.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[146:1](sbe4329.htm#fr_257.md) That is, the
Sacrificer bestows it on Agni; with probably, however, the *double
entente*, 'this Adhvaryu priest bestows it on the Sacrificer.'

<span id="fn_257"></span>[146:2](sbe4329.htm#fr_258.md) See VII, 4, 1, 10
seq.; 15 seq.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[147:1](sbe4329.htm#fr_259.md) Viz. of Agni (and
the Sacrificer). The ceremony alluded to was the fivefold libation of
ghee offered on the gold man (representing Agni and the Sacrificer), see
VII, 4, 1, 34-35.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[148:1](sbe4329.htm#fr_260.md) That is, so much as
to the objects to which the different parts of the altar are sacred or
dedicated.
