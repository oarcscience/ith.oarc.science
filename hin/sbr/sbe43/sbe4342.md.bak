### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### AGNIYO*G*ANA, OR YOKING OF THE FIRE-ALTAR; AND SOMA-SACRIFICE.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:1">9:4:4:1</span></span>1. Then,
early next morning <span id="fr_439"></span>[2](#fn_432.md), when about to
bespeak the morning prayer <span id="fr_440"></span>[3](#fn_433.md), he
yokes the Fire-altar, thinking, 'With it, when yoked, I shall obtain;'
and by it, when yoked, he obtains all wishes. He

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

yokes it prior to the whole performance, so that all that is done
thereafter is laden on that yoked (altar-cart).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:2">9:4:4:2</span></span>2. He
yokes it on the enclosing-sticks, for those enclosing-sticks are
fires <span id="fr_441"></span>[1](#fn_434.md): it is with fires he thus
yokes the fire-altar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:3">9:4:4:3</span></span>3. Having
touched the middle enclosing-stick <span
id="fr_442"></span>[2](#fn_435.md), he mutters this formula (Vâ*g*. S.
XVIII, 51), 'The Fire I yoke with might, with ghee!'--might means
strength: thus, 'The fire I yoke (furnish) with strength, with
ghee;'--'the heavenly bird, great in vigour,'--for that (fire-altar) is
indeed a heavenly bird, and great in vigour, in smoke <span
id="fr_443"></span>[3](#fn_436.md);--'Thereby we will go to the region of
the bay, rising unto the light, beyond the highest firmament!'--The
firmament, doubtless, is the heavenly world: thus, 'Thereby we will go
to the region, of the bay (horse, the sun) mounting up to the heavenly
world, beyond the highest firmament.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:4">9:4:4:4</span></span>4. Then
on the southern (right) one, with (Vâ*g*. S. XVIII, 52), 'By these
never-decaying, feathered wings of thine wherewith thou repellest the
demons, O Agni, may we fly to the world of the righteous whither the
erst-born seers went of old!' he thereby alludes to those *Ri*shis <span
id="fr_444"></span>[4](#fn_437.md).

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:5">9:4:4:5</span></span>5. Then
on the northern (left) one, with (Vâ*g*. S. XVIII, 53), 'The potent
drop, the faithful eagle, the golden-winged bird, the active
(bhura*n*yu),'--golden means immortal: thus, 'the immortal-winged bird,
the bearer (bhart*ri*);'--'the mighty is seated in the firm seat: homage
be to thee, injure me not!'--he thereby gives utterance to a surrender
of his own self.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:6">9:4:4:6</span></span>6. Now
that middle formula is the body, and the two on both sides thereof are
the wings (of the bird-shaped altar): hence these two allude to
'wings <span id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_438.md),' for these two are the
wings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:7">9:4:4:7</span></span>7. With
three (formulas) he yokes it,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is,
as great as is his measure, with so much he thus yokes him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:8">9:4:4:8</span></span>8. And
when he has pressed the king (Soma) he offers in the fire <span
id="fr_446"></span>[2](#fn_439.md). This, indeed, is that very rite of
consecration (or pressing)--and by that he is now consecrated (or
pressed)--which this (Sacrificer) is permitted to perform by those
deities with whose permission he is consecrated <span
id="fr_447"></span>[3](#fn_440.md); for he alone becomes king whom the
(other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, and not he whom (they
do) not (allow to assume it). Now when he offers in the fire he thereby
consecrates (anoints) Agni, and that divine body of his, being
consecrated by Soma, becomes consecrated by the nectar of immortality.
And he himself drinks (thereof): he thereby consecrates

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

himself, and this self (body) of his, being consecrated by Soma, becomes
consecrated by the nectar of immortality.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:9">9:4:4:9</span></span>9. Having
offered in the fire (or, on the fire-altar), he drinks (Soma), for that
(fire-altar) is his (the Sacrificer's) divine body <span
id="fr_448"></span>[1](#fn_441), and this (Sacrificer's real body.md) is
his human one; and the gods indeed were first, and afterwards men:
therefore, having offered (Soma) in the fire, he drinks (thereof).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:10">9:4:4:10</span></span>10.
Having now obtained the wish for (the accomplishment of) which he yokes
it (the altar), he unyokes it when about to bespeak the Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*iya
stotra <span id="fr_449"></span>[2](#fn_442.md),--for the Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*iya
is the heavenly world, and it is for the attainment of that (world) that
he yokes it: thus (he unyokes it) after obtaining the wish for which he
yoked it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:11">9:4:4:11</span></span>11. It
is prior to the Stotra that he unyokes it:--were he to unyoke after the
Stotra, he would pass beyond that world <span
id="fr_450"></span>[3](#fn_443.md) and lose it; but when he unyokes prior
to the Stotra, he unyokes forthwith after reaching the world of heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:12">9:4:4:12</span></span>12. He
unyokes it on the enclosing-sticks, for it

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

is on the enclosing-sticks that he yokes it, and at whatever place (of
the body) people yoke a horse there they also unyoke it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:13">9:4:4:13</span></span>13.
Having touched it (the fire) at the two joints <span
id="fr_451"></span>[1](#fn_444.md), he mutters these two formulas,--thus
two formulas equal in power three enclosing-sticks,--with (Vâ*g*. S.
XVIII, 54), 'The sky's head thou art, the earth's navel, \[the essence
of the waters and plants, the life of all, the ample refuge (?): homage
be to the path!\]' on the right, and with (55), 'On the head of the All
dost thou keep standing, \[in the (aerial) ocean is thy heart, in the
waters thy life: bestow water, send the water-store (cloud),--from the
sky, from the cloud, from the air, from the earth, favour us with
rain!\]' on the left (joint),--thus with two (verses) containing (the
word) 'head,' for this, is indeed its head; and containing (the words)
'in the waters <span id="fr_452"></span>[2](#fn_445.md)': that
Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*iya doubtless is Agni Vai*s*vânara's chant of praise, and
water is (a means of) appeasing,--therefore (he touches them) with two
(verses) containing (the words)--'the waters.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:14">9:4:4:14</span></span>14.
With two (verses) he unyokes it,--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and Agni
is the Sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with
so much he thus unyokes him. With three (verses) he yokes,--that (makes)
five,--the fire-altar consists of five layers, the year (of) five
seasons, and Agni is

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great is
this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:15">9:4:4:15</span></span>15.
Now, some yoke it (the fire-altar) at a Prâya*n*îya <span
id="fr_453"></span>[1](#fn_446.md) Atirâtra, and unyoke it at an Udayanîya,
saying, 'The unyoking, surely, is a certain form of completion, and why
should we perform a form of completion prior to the completion (of the
sacrifice)?' But let him not do this, for day by day this sacrifice is
performed, and day by day it comes to completion; day by day he yokes
that (altar) for the attainment of the heavenly world, and day by day he
thereby attains the heavenly world: let him therefore yoke it day by
day, and unyoke it day by day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:16">9:4:4:16</span></span>16.
And, indeed, it would be just as if, at the Prâya*n*îya Atirâtra, after
reciting the kindling-verses, he were to say, 'Hereafter <span
id="fr_454"></span>[2](#fn_447.md), at the Udayanîya, I shall recite (them
again)!' Let him therefore yoke (the altar) day by day, and unyoke it
day by day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:4:17">9:4:4:17</span></span>17. And
on this point, *S*â*nd*ilya, indeed, having enjoined on the Kaṅkatîyas
the day-by-day performance,

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

went on his way, saying, 'Day by day they shall yoke for you, and day by
day they shall unyoke!' Let him therefore yoke day by day, and unyoke
day by day.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_431"></span>[249:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_438.md) For the complete
formulas, see V, 3, 3, 11, 12.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[249:2](sbe4342.htm#fr_439.md) That is, on the
first Sutyâ, or pressing-day.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[249:3](sbe4342.htm#fr_440.md) That is, by calling
on the Hot*ri* to 'Recite to the gods, the early coming!' see III, 9, 3,
10, with note thereto giving particulars regarding the Prâtaranuvâka.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[250:1](sbe4342.htm#fr_441.md) See the ritual
legend, I, 3, 3, 13 seq.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[250:2](sbe4342.htm#fr_442.md) That is, the one
along the hind (or west) side of the Âhavanîya fire on the great altar,
being the base of the triangle formed by the three enclosing-sticks. The
order in which they are touched is the same as that in which they were
laid down.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[250:3](sbe4342.htm#fr_443.md) Mahîdhara actually
takes 'smoke (dhûma)' here to be intended as the literal meaning of
'vayas.'

<span id="fn_437"></span>[250:4](sbe4342.htm#fr_444.md) Viz. the seven
*Ri*shis, identified with the seven vital airs which came to constitute
the first Purusha (Agni-Pra*g*âpati), and hence the bird-shaped
fire-altar. See VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[251:1](sbe4342.htm#fr_445.md) In the first
formula the word for 'bird (eagle)' is 'supar*n*a,' literally 'the
well-winged (well-feathered) one.'

<span id="fn_439"></span>[251:2](sbe4342.htm#fr_446.md) This refers to the
libations made from the several cups (grahas), the contents of which are
afterwards consumed by the priests (and Sacrificer); cf. part ii, p.
316, note 1.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[251:3](sbe4342.htm#fr_447.md) For the same
irregular construction, see [IX, 4, 1, 13](sbe4339.htm#9:4:1:13.md).

<span id="fn_441"></span>[252:1](sbe4342.htm#fr_448.md) See [IX, 3, 4,
12](sbe4338.htm#9:3:4:12.md).

<span id="fn_442"></span>[252:2](sbe4342.htm#fr_449.md) The
Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*iya (or Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*îya) stotra is the last and
characteristic chant of the Agnish*t*oma mode of Soma-sacrifice, whence
it is more properly called Agnish*t*oma-sâman; the Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*iya,
properly speaking, being the verses, Sâma-v. II, 53, 54, chanted to a
particular tune, and generally (though not always) used for the closing
chant of the Agnish*t*oma.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[252:3](sbe4342.htm#fr_450.md) That is, because
the Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*iya marks, as it were, the end of the (Agnish*t*oma)
Soma-sacrifice, and anything performed thereafter is, so to speak,
outside the sacrifice, or beyond it. Katy. *S*r. XVIII, 6, 17 calls it
Âgnimâruta stotra, i.e. the chant belonging to the Âgnimâruta-*s*astra
(which has to be recited by the Hot*ri* after that chant); cf. part ii,
p. 369 note.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[253:1](sbe4342.htm#fr_451.md) That is, at the two
points where the right (southern) and left (northern) enclosing-sticks
(forming the two sides of the triangle, the apex of which lies east of
the centre of the fire) meet the western enclosing-stick (as the base of
the triangle).

<span id="fn_445"></span>[253:2](sbe4342.htm#fr_452.md) The first verse, in
point of fact, contains the genitive case 'of the waters.'

<span id="fn_446"></span>[254:1](sbe4342.htm#fr_453.md) For the Prâya*n*îya
ish*t*i (to five deities) of the ordinary Agnish*t*oma, see part ii, pp.
47, 48, note. In the present case a special Soma-sacrifice of the
Atirâtra type would seem to take its place, just as the Pavitra, an
Agnish*t*oma Soma-sacrifice, at the Râ*g*asûya, took the place of the
ordinary Anvârambha*n*îyâ ish*t*i (or opening offering); see part iii,
p. 42. In the same way there would apparently be a special Udayanîya
Soma-sacrifice; whilst our author would have the ceremonies of yoking
and unyoking of the fire-altar performed on the very day (or days) of
the Soma-sacrifice, that is to say, he would have the ordinary
Prâya*n*îyesh*t*i and Udayanîyesh*t*i performed as parts of the
principal Soma-day (or days, if there are to be more than one).

<span id="fn_447"></span>[254:2](sbe4342.htm#fr_454.md) Or, therefore, as
Sâya*n*a takes it. If the Udayanîya were a special Soma-sacrifice, the
Sâmidhenîs (part i, p. 102 seq.; ii, p. 13, note 3) would have to be
recited anew.
