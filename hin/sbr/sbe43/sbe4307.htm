These (bricks) are those regions (quarters); he places them on the range of the two reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I> (bricks), for the reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I> are these two (worlds): he thereby places the regions within these two (worlds), whence there are regions within these two (worlds). He lays down (these bricks) in every direction: he thus places the regions in all (the four) directions, whence the regions are in all directions. [He places them] on all sides so as to face each other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: he thereby</p>

<p><A NAME="page_27"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 27</FONT></A></p>  
<p>makes the regions on all sides face each other, and hence the regions on all sides face each other. He lays (the bricks) down separately, settles them separately, and pronounces the s&ucirc;dadohas over them separately, for separate are the regions.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:1:9">8:2:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. He then lays down the fifth regional (or &Acirc;<I>s</I>vin&icirc; brick). Now that region is the one above&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and that same region above, doubtless, is yonder sun: it is yonder sun he thus places thereon. He places this (brick) within the southern regional one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: he thus places yonder sun within the southern region, and therefore he moves within the southern region.</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_28"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 28</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the air, the supporter of the regions, the ruler of beings,'--for he (the sun) is indeed the holder of the air, the supporter of the regions, and the ruler of beings;--'thou art the wave, the drop, of water,'--the wave, doubtless, means the essence;--'Vi<I>s</I>vakarman is thy <I>Ri</I>shi!'--Vi<I>s</I>vakarman (the all-shaper), doubtless, is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati: thus, 'Thou art fashioned by Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.'--'May the A<I>s</I>vins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!' for the A<I>s</I>vins, as Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:1:11">8:2:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. Now as to why he lays down these &Acirc;<I>s</I>vin&icirc; (bricks). When Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati had become relaxed (disjointed), the deities took him and went away in different directions. Now what part of him there was above the feet and below the waist, that part of him the two A<I>s</I>vins took and kept going away from him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:1:12">8:2:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. He said to them, 'Come to me and restore unto me that wherewith ye have gone away from me!'--'What will accrue to us therefrom?'--'That part of my body shall be sacred unto you!'--'So be it!' so the A<I>s</I>vins restored that (part) unto him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:1:13">8:2:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. Now these five &Acirc;<I>s</I>vin&icirc; (bricks) are that same (part) of his (Agni's) body; and when he now puts them into this (layer of the altar), he thereby restores to him what (part) of his body these (bricks) are: that is why he puts them into this (layer).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:1:14">8:2:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. 'Thou art firmly founded, firmly seated, firm,' he says, for whatsoever is steady and established that is firm. Now that part of his (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati-Agni's) body was, as it were, unsteady, unfirm; and having made it steady and firm they (the A<I>s</I>vins) restored it to him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:1:15">8:2:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. 'Nestlike, fat, wise,' he says, for this indeed</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_29"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 29</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is as a nest for his body.--'By thine own powers seat thee here, a holder of powers,' he says, for they did make that (part) of him powerful.--'Thou art the Earth's soil-cover,' he says, for that (lower part) of his body is, as it were, in connection with the soil-cover. At the range of the Reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I> (he places the bricks),--the Reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I> are the ribs, for level with the ribs, as it were, is that (part) of his body. He places them on every side, for on every side the A<I>s</I>vins restored that (part) of his (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's) body.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:1:16">8:2:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. He then lays down two Ritavy&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (seasonal bricks);--these two, the <I>Ri</I>tavy&acirc;, are the seasons (<I>ri</I>tu): it is the seasons he thus bestows thereon. [He lays them down, with V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIV, 6], '<I>S</I>ukra and <I>S</I>u<I>k</I>i, the two summer-seasons;'--these are the names of these two: it is with their names that he thus lays them down. There are two bricks, for a season consists of two months. He settles them once only: he thereby makes (the two months) one season.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:1:17">8:2:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. And as to why he lays down these two in this (layer):--this Agni (fire-altar) is the year, and the year is these worlds. Now that part of him which is above the earth and below the atmosphere, is this second layer; and that same part of him (Agni, the year,) is the summer season. And when he lays down those two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Agni) that part of his body which these two are: this is why he lays down these two (bricks) in this (layer).</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_30"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 30</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:1:18">8:2:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. And, again, as to why he lays down these two in this (layer). This fire-altar is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the year. Now that (part) of him which is above the feet and below the waist is this second layer; and that same part of him is the summer season. Thus when he lays down those two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him that (part) of his body which these two ale: this is why he lays down these two (bricks) in this (layer).</p>

From these two lokamp<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;s (or space-fillers) he starts filling up, in two turns, the still available spaces of the 'body' of the altar, as also the whole of the two wings and the tail. For other particulars as to the way in which these are laid down, see <a href="sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:1">VIII, 7, 2, 1</A> seqq. The 'body' of an ordinary altar requires in this layer 1028 lokamp<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;s of three different kinds, viz. a foot (Ind.), half a foot, and a quarter of a foot square, occupying together a space of 321 square feet, whilst the 98 special (ya<I>g</I>ushmat&icirc;) bricks fill up a space of 79 square feet. Each wing requires 309 lokamp<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;s of together 120 square feet; whilst the tail takes 283 such bricks, of together 110 square feet. The total number of lokamp<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;s in the layer thus amounts to 7929 of all sizes, equal to 671 square feet. If (as is done in K&acirc;ty. <I>S</I>rautas. XVII, 7, 21) the 21 bricks of the G&acirc;rhapatya (part iii, p. 304) are added to this number, the total number of lokamp<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;s is 1,950. Similarly, in the second, third, and fourth layers; whilst the last layer requires about a thousand lokamp<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;s more than any of the others, viz. 2,922, or, including the special hearths, 3,000. The total number of such bricks required--including the 21 of the G&acirc;rhapatya--amounts to 10,800. Cp. Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 255.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_76"></A><A HREF="sbe4307.htm#fr_77">23:1</A> The main portion of the special bricks of the second layer consists of five, or (if, for the nonce, we take the two southern sets of half-bricks as one) of four sets of four bricks each, or of together sixteen bricks, each measuring a foot square, placed on the range of the reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I> bricks so as to form the outer rim of a square measuring five feet on each side, and having in the middle a blank square of nine square feet. Each of the four sides of the reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I> rim contains a complete set of four bricks; but as there are five bricks on each side, the one in the left-hand corner (looking at them from the centre of the square) is counted along with the adjoining set. Each set, proceeding from left to right (that is, in sunwise fashion), consists of the following bricks,--&acirc;<I>s</I>vin&icirc;, vai<I>s</I>vadev&icirc;, pr&acirc;<I>n</I>abh<I>ri</I>t, and apasy&acirc;, the last of these occupying the corner spaces. The southern bricks consist, however, of two sets of half-bricks (running with their long sides from west to east), counted as the second and fifth set respectively. The eastern and western bricks are laid down so that their line-marks (which, in the case of the bricks of the second and fourth layers, are of an indefinite number) run from west to east; whilst those of the southern <A NAME="page_24"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 24</FONT></A> and northern ones run from south to north. All the five bricks of each class, beginning with the &acirc;<I>s</I>vin&icirc;s, are laid down at the same time, proceeding again in sunwise fashion (east, south, &amp;c.); the</p>

<p>order of the procedure being only interrupted by the two Ritavy&acirc; bricks being laid down, immediately after the placing of the five &acirc;<I>s</I>vin&icirc;, exactly over the two <I>ri</I>tavy&acirc;s of the first layer, that is to say in the fifth (easterly) space from the centre, north and south of the spine. The only other special bricks of the second layer are nineteen vayasy&acirc;s placed at the four ends of the two spines, viz. four in the east, and five in each of the other quarters.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_77"></A><A HREF="sbe4307.htm#fr_78">25:1</A> This comparison doubtless refers to the way in which the central portion of the special bricks of this layer are arranged so as completely to enclose an empty space in the middle.. In the first layer there was, no doubt, a similar enclosure of bricks as the reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I> range, but the central space was not left quite empty. In the end, however, the empty spaces are in both cases filled up by 'space-fillers.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_78"></A><A HREF="sbe4307.htm#fr_79">25:2</A> The author seems to take 'rasa' as an adjective (= rama<I>n</I>&icirc;ya), as does Mah&icirc;dhara, who interprets the formula as meaning 'for the gods&#8217; great, cheerful happiness.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_79"></A><A HREF="sbe4307.htm#fr_80">26:1</A> The word 'apsas,' which western philologists usually take to mean 'cheek,' is here apparently connected with 'ap,' water.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_81"></A><A HREF="sbe4307.htm#fr_82">26:3</A> 'Samya<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>' may either mean 'tending to one and the same point,' or 'running in the same direction, parallel to each other.' It is probably in the former sense that we have to take it here, though not quite literally, but in so far as the line-marks of these <A NAME="page_27"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 27</FONT></A> bricks, if continued towards the centre of the altar, intersect one another. As applied to the quarters this meaning would then modify itself to that of 'facing each other.' On the other hand, it is quite possible that the meaning of 'tending in the same direction' is the one intended; and it would in that case probably apply to the fact that the sets opposite to each other have their line-marks running in the same direction, or are parallel to each other; and this meaning would seem to be implied to the quarters where the author supports his argument by the fact that the wind blows, and the rain falls, in the same direction in all the four quarters (<a href="sbe4309.htm#8:2:3:2">VIII, 2, 3, 2</A>; <a href="sbe4309.htm#8:2:3:5">5</A>). It is curious that the expression is used by the author in connection with the &acirc;<I>s</I>vin&icirc;, pr&acirc;<I>n</I>abh<I>ri</I>t, and apasy&acirc;, but not with the vai<I>s</I>vadev&icirc;, the line-marks of which all meet in one central point, which is not the case with the others. At <a href="sbe4311.htm#8:3:1:11">VIII, 3, 1, 11</A>, on the other hand, it is used again in connection with the Di<I>s</I>y&acirc; bricks, which, in the third layer, occupy exactly the same spaces as the Vai<I>s</I>vadev&icirc;s do here.</P>
