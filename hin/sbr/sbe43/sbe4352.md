### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:1">10:2:3:1</span></span>1. Now
this Vedi (altar-ground, viz. the Mahâvedi of the Soma-sacrifice) is
just that (right) measure for the Vedi of the sevenfold <span
id="fr_593"></span>[3](#fn_583) (fire-altar.md).

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Having fixed upon
(the place for) the sacrificial ground, he enters the Patnî*s*âla <span
id="fr_594"></span>[1](#fn_584) by the front (east.md) door, and having
thrown up (the ground) for the Gârhapatya, he sprinkles it with water.
From the raised (site) of the Gârhapatya he strides seven steps
eastward. From there he measures off a fathom <span
id="fr_595"></span>[2](#fn_585.md) towards the east, and having, in the
middle thereof, thrown up (the ground) for the Âhavanîya, he sprinkles
it with water. From the front part of the fathom he strides three steps
eastward: that is the end of the Vedi <span
id="fr_596"></span>[3](#fn_586.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:2">10:2:3:2</span></span>2. Now,
there are here, including the fathom (as one), eleven steps <span
id="fr_597"></span>[4](#fn_587.md) between the end of the Vedi and the
(original) Gârhapatya;--the Trish*t*ubh consists

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

of eleven syllables, and the Trish*t*ubh is a thunderbolt, and the
Trish*t*ubh means strength: it is thus by the thunderbolt, and by
strength, that the Sacrificer from the very first drives off the fiends,
the Rakshas, from the mouth of the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:3">10:2:3:3</span></span>3. This
is the womb of the Vedi, for it was from that womb that the gods begat
the Vedi. And that (space of a) fathom which was (marked off), is the
womb of the Gârhapatya <span id="fr_598"></span>[1](#fn_588.md), for it was
from that womb that the gods begat the Gârhapatya; and from the
Gârhapatya the Âhavanîya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:4">10:2:3:4</span></span>4. From
the (western) end of the Vedi he measures off the Vedi <span
id="fr_599"></span>[2](#fn_589.md) thirty-six steps long eastward, thirty
(steps) broad behind, and twenty-four (steps broad) in front,--that
makes ninety. This, then, is the Vedi measuring ninety steps: thereon he
lays out the sevenfold Fire-altar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:5">10:2:3:5</span></span>5. As
to this they say, 'How does this sevenfold (Person, the fire-altar,)
correspond to this Vedi (measuring ninety steps)?' Well, there are these

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

ten vital airs in a man <span id="fr_600"></span>[1](#fn_590.md), four
limbs, and the trunk as the fifteenth; in the same way in the second,
and in the same way in the third (man),--in six men this makes ninety;
and one man remains over. Now, (that seventh) man is fivefold--hair,
skin, flesh, bone, and marrow (fat), and this Vedi also is fivefold--the
four regions (quarters), and the body (of the altar) as the fifth <span
id="fr_601"></span>[2](#fn_591): thus this sevenfold (altar.md) does indeed
correspond to this Vedi.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:6">10:2:3:6</span></span>6. Now,
some, intending to construct higher forms (of altars), increase (the
number of) these steps and this fathom accordingly, saying, 'We enlarge
the womb in accordance therewith;'--but let him not do so; for the womb
does not enlarge along with the child that has been born <span
id="fr_602"></span>[3](#fn_592.md), but, indeed, only as long as the child
is within the womb, does the womb enlarge, and so long, indeed, the
growth of the (unborn) child here (lasts) <span
id="fr_603"></span>[4](#fn_593.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:7">10:2:3:7</span></span>7.
Indeed, those who do it in that way, deprive this Father Pra*g*âpati of
his due proportions; and they will become the worse for sacrificing, for
they deprive Father Pra*g*âpati of his due proportions.

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> As large as this
Vedi <span id="fr_604"></span>[1](#fn_594) of the sevenfold (fire-altar.md)
is, fourteen times as large he measures out the Vedi of the one hundred
and one-fold (altar).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:8">10:2:3:8</span></span>8. He
now measures off a cord thirty-six steps <span
id="fr_605"></span>[2](#fn_595) (yards.md) long, and folds it up into seven
(equal) parts: of this he covers (the . space of) the three front
(eastern) parts (with bricks), and leaves four (parts) <span
id="fr_606"></span>[3](#fn_596.md) free.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:9">10:2:3:9</span></span>9. He
then measures (a cord) thirty steps long, and lays it sevenfold: of this
he covers three parts (with bricks) behind, and leaves four (parts)
free <span id="fr_607"></span>[4](#fn_597.md).

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:10">10:2:3:10</span></span>10.
He then measures (a cord) twenty-four steps long, and lays it sevenfold:
of this he covers three parts in front (with bricks), and leaves four
(parts) free <span id="fr_608"></span>[1](#fn_598.md). This, then, is the
measuring out of the Vedi.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:11">10:2:3:11</span></span>11.
Now as to the (other) forms of the fire-altar. Twenty-eight man's
lengths long (from west to east) and twenty-eight man's lengths across
is the body (of the altar), fourteen man's lengths the right, and
fourteen the left wing, and fourteen the tail. Fourteen cubits (aratni)
he covers (with bricks) on the right, and fourteen on the left wing, and
fourteen spans (vitasti) on the tail. Such is the measure of (an altar
of) ninety-eight man's lengths with the additional space (for wings and
tail).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:12">10:2:3:12</span></span>12.
He now measures a cord of three man's lengths, and lays it sevenfold: of
this he covers (the space of) four parts (with bricks) on the body (of
the altar), and three parts on the wings and tail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:13">10:2:3:13</span></span>13.
He then measures one three cubits long, and lays it sevenfold: of this
he covers (the space of) three parts on the right, and three on the left
wing, and leaves four (parts) free.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:14">10:2:3:14</span></span>14.
He then measures one a span long, and lays it sevenfold: of this he
covers (the space of) three parts on the tail, and leaves four (parts)
free. In this way does this one hundred and one-fold (Agni) correspond
to this Vedi.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:15">10:2:3:15</span></span>15.
As to this they say, 'When thirteen man's lengths are over, how is it
that these do not deviate

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

from the right proportions (of the altar) <span
id="fr_609"></span>[1](#fn_599.md)?' Well, what right proportions there
were in the case of that seventh man's length <span
id="fr_610"></span>[2](#fn_600), these same proportions (also apply.md) to
all these (redundant man's lengths).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:16">10:2:3:16</span></span>16.
And they also say, 'When Pra*g*âpati had formed the body he filled it up
with these (redundant lengths) wherever there was anything defective in
it; and therefore also it is rightly proportioned.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:17">10:2:3:17</span></span>17.
As to this some say, 'The first time they construct a simple
(altar <span id="fr_611"></span>[3](#fn_601).md), then the one higher by
one (man's length), up to the one of unlimited size.' Let him not do so.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:3:18">10:2:3:18</span></span>18.
Sevenfold, indeed, Pra*g*âpati was created in the beginning. He went on
constructing (developing) his body, and stopped at the one hundred and
one-fold one. He who constructs one lower than a sevenfold one cuts this
Father Pra*g*âpati in twain: he will be the worse for sacrificing as one
would be by doing injury to his better. And he who constructs one
exceeding the one hundred and one-fold one steps beyond this universe,
for Pra*g*âpati is this universe. Hence he should first construct the
sevenfold (altar), then the next higher up to the one hundred and
one-fold one, but he should not construct one exceeding the one hundred
and one-fold

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

one, and thus, indeed, he neither cuts this Father Pra*g*âpati in twain,
nor does he step beyond this universe.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_583"></span>[306:3](sbe4352.htm#fr_593.md) That is, measuring
seven times the length of a man standing with upstretched arms.

<span id="fn_584"></span>[307:1](sbe4352.htm#fr_594.md) That is, 'the
wife's hall,'--the sacrificial hall or shed, usually called
Prâ*k*înava*ms*a or Prâgva*ms*a, measuring 20 cubits by 10 (part ii, p.
3, note 2), in which the original fires and vedi of ish*t*is are
enclosed at the Soma-sacrifice; see the plan, part ii, p. 475.

<span id="fn_585"></span>[307:2](sbe4352.htm#fr_595) A fathom (vyâma.md) is
the space between the tips of the two middle fingers of a man standing
with outstretched arms, this being considered the man's height. In this
paragraph, the author roughly recapitulates the main dimensions of the
sacrificial ground used for ish*t*is, which will also be required for
the present purpose. The dimensions here supplied will give about the
distance of eight steps between (the centres of) the Gârhapatya and
Âhavanîya fires required by I, 7, 3, 23. In the middle of the space of a
fathom here alluded to as the easternmost space of the hall, the
(original square) Âhavanîya is laid down, but this ultimately makes way
for the new circular Gârhapatya hearth built of bricks and having the
whole of this 'fathom' for its diameter.

<span id="fn_586"></span>[307:3](sbe4352.htm#fr_596.md) That is, the
hindmost (western) point of the (easterly line of the) Mahâvedi of the
Soma-sacrifice, where the peg, called 'anta*h*pâtya,' is driven in,
being three steps east from the post of the front door of the
Prâ*k*înava*ms*a (and hence three steps from the future circular
Gârhapatya hearth built of bricks).

<span id="fn_587"></span>[307:4](sbe4352.htm#fr_597.md) Literally, these
are (ten) steps, having the fathom as an eleventh (space or step).

<span id="fn_588"></span>[308:1](sbe4352.htm#fr_598.md) That is, the
brick-built Gârhapatya of the Agni*k*ayana on which the Ukhya Agni,
having been carried about by the Sacrificer for a year, is transferred
from the fire-pan (ûkhâ), and from which afterwards the fire of the
great altar is derived. This new Gârhapatya has been raised on the site
of the old (square) Âhavanîya (the so-called '*s*âlâdvârya' or hall-door
fire), on which the fire in the pan, the Ukhya Agni, was kindled (esha
âhavanîyo vakshyamâ*n*âyâ*s* *k*ayanamahâveder gârhapatyo bhavati;
Sây.). The pan containing this fire was then placed half a fathom south
of (the centre of) the old Âhavanîya, and hence so as to stand quite
close to the brick-built Gârhapatya raised in its place, and forming a
circle with a diameter of one fathom. Thus this 'space of a fathom' is
here quite correctly referred to as the original source of the fires of
the Agni*k*ayana.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[308:2](sbe4352.htm#fr_599.md) For the dimensions
of the Mahâvedi here referred to, see part ii, p. 111 seq.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[309:1](sbe4352.htm#fr_600.md) That is, in the
first of these seven persons or men, making up the sacrificial man
(ya*gñ*a-purusha), Pra*g*âpati; that first man being the Sacrificer
himself, as supplying the standard for these measures.

<span id="fn_591"></span>[309:2](sbe4352.htm#fr_601.md) That is, the fifth
region, situated in a vertical direction, this being represented by the
fire-altar which rises upwards.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[309:3](sbe4352.htm#fr_602.md) Somewhat
differently Professor Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 444, 'The womb does
not grow in proportion with the embryo produced therein.'

<span id="fn_593"></span>[309:4](sbe4352.htm#fr_603.md) The argument of the
author apparently is, that the planned enlargement of the fire-altar is
an enlargement of the child Agni, after he has been born, and does not
involve an increased size of the original sacrificial ground of the
Prâ*k*înava*ms*a.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[310:1](sbe4352.htm#fr_604.md) That is, of course,
the Mahâvedi on which the (ordinary) fire-altar is raised, and which is
enlarged in proportion to the size of the altar. The intermediate sizes
of the fire-altar between the two extremes here alluded to increase each
by four square 'man's lengths' (the man being measured with upstretched
arms), or by one man's length on each side of the body of the altar; the
largest possible altar thus measuring 101 man's lengths on each side.

<span id="fn_595"></span>[310:2](sbe4352.htm#fr_605.md) A step, or pace
(prakrama) is equal to 3 feet (pada), a foot measuring 12
finger-breadths (aṅgula),--these measures being, however (at least
theoretically), relative to the Sacrificer's height.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[310:3](sbe4352.htm#fr_606.md) That is to say, he
stretches the cord along the ground from the (western) 'end of the Vedi'
eastwards, and marks off on the ground three-sevenths of the cord on the
eastern side, that part of the Vedi being afterwards covered by the
brick-built altar, whilst the remaining space behind is required for the
Sadas and Havirdhâna sheds, &c. If we take the Mahâvedi to be 108 feet
long (= 36 prakramas) this would allow 15 3/8 feet for each part, or
some 46 feet for the length of the part to be covered with bricks, and
this measure, being equal to seven man's lengths, would allow 6 4/7 feet
for a man's length (including the upstretched arms). Between the altar
and the front (eastern) edge of the Vedi a space of one foot is,
however, to be left.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[310:4](sbe4352.htm#fr_607.md) That is, he
stretches the cord across (north to south) and marks off the three
central divisions of it as forming the hind side of the altar (leaving
two-sevenths of the string free on either side). This gives 12 5/7 (out
of 90) feet for each part, or 38 4/7 feet for the back, or western, side
of the altar.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[311:1](sbe4352.htm#fr_608.md) This gives 10 2/7
(out of 72) feet for each part, or 30 6/7 feet for the front, or
eastern, side of the altar. The measurements here given are intended as
a refinement on the usual square shape of the fire-altar.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[312:1](sbe4352.htm#fr_609.md) Or, from the right
total (sampad) which the altar ought to obtain. By [paragraph
7](sbe4352.htm#10:2:3:7.md), the altar is to be made fourteen times as
large as the sevenfold one; and the latter being said to be in exact
proportion with Pra*g*âpati (in [paragraph 3](sbe4352.htm#10:2:3:3).md),
the larger altar would thus show an excess of thirteen man's lengths
over the rightly proportioned altar.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[312:2](sbe4352.htm#fr_610.md) Viz. in [paragraph
5](sbe4352.htm#10:2:3:5.md).

<span id="fn_601"></span>[312:3](sbe4352.htm#fr_611.md) That is, one of a
single man's length on each side.
