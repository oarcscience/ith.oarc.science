### FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:1">9:4:1:1</span></span>1. He
then offers the Râsh*t*rabh*ri*t (realm-sustaining) oblations;--the
realm-sustainers, doubtless, are the kings, for it is they that sustain
realms. These deities, indeed, have been consecrated by this same
consecration ceremony by which he (the Sacrificer) is now to be
consecrated: it is them he thereby gratifies, and thus gratified by
offering, they grant him permission (to perform) this consecration
ceremony, and, permitted by them, he is consecrated; for only he becomes
king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, but not
he whom they do not (allow to assume it). And inasmuch as the kings
sustain realms, and these gods are kings, therefore Realm-sustaining
(oblations are performed).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:2">9:4:1:2</span></span>2. And,
again, as to why he offers the Realm-sustaining (oblations). From
Pra*g*âpati, when dismembered, couples went forth, in the form of
Gandharvas and Apsaras; and he, having turned into a chariot, enclosed
them, and having enclosed them, he took them to himself and made them
his own; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), thereby enclosing
them, take them to himself and make them his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:3">9:4:1:3</span></span>3. Now
that Pra*g*âpati who was dismembered, is this very Agni who is here
being built up; and

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

those couples which went forth from him, are these same deities to whom
he now makes offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:4">9:4:1:4</span></span>4. He
makes offering to the Gandharvas and Apsaras, for in the form of
Gandharvas and Apsaras they went forth (from Pra*g*âpati). But the
Gandharvas and Apsaras also busy themselves with sweet scent (gandha)
and beauteous form (rûpa <span id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_389).md), whence
if any one goes to his mate he cultivates sweet scent and a beautiful
appearance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:5">9:4:1:5</span></span>5. He
offers pairs (of oblations), for birth originates from a pair; and he
alone is (ruler of) a kingdom who propagates offspring, but not he who
does not propagate offspring. And inasmuch as couples sustain the realm,
and these deities consist of couples, these (oblations are called)
Realm-sustainers. With ghee taken in twelve ladlings (he offers), and
there are twelve of these oblations: the significance of this has been
explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:6">9:4:1:6</span></span>6. To the
male (deity) he makes offering first, then to the females: he thereby
endows the male pre-eminently with power <span
id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_390.md). To a single male he makes offering, and
to many females, whence even a single man has many wives. To the male
(deity) he makes offering both with the Vasha*t*-call and the
Svâhâ-call, to the female (deities) only with the Svâhâ: he thereby
endows the male pre-eminently with power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:7">9:4:1:7</span></span>7. \[He
offers, with, Vâ*g*. S. XVIII, 38-43\], 'The

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

law-upholding, law-abiding,'--that is, the truth-upholding,
truth-abiding,--'Agni is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the
plants,'--for as a Gandharva, Agni, indeed, went forth with the plants
as the Asparas, his mates,--'Delights (mud) by name,'--the plants are
indeed delights, for everything here delights in plants--'may he protect
this our priesthood and nobility: to him Hail! Vâ*t*! To them (fem.)
Hail!' The meaning of this has been explained <span
id="fr_397"></span>[1](#fn_391.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:8">9:4:1:8</span></span>8. 'The
Close-knit,'--yonder sun is indeed close-knit, for he knits together the
days and nights;--'all-wealthy,'--for that (sun) indeed is every kind of
wealth;--'Sûrya is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the sun-motes;'--for
as a Gandharva, the sun, indeed, went forth with the sun-motes as the
Apsaras, his mates,--'Mobile (âyu) by name,'--for moving together <span
id="fr_398"></span>[2](#fn_392.md), as it were, the sun-motes float;--'may
he protect this our priesthood and nobility,'--the meaning of this has
been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:9">9:4:1:9</span></span>9. 'The
most blessed,'--that is, the most worthy of worship,--'sun-rayed,'--for
like the sun's are the moon's rays;--'*K*andramas (the

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

moon) is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the stars;'--for as a Gandharva
the moon, indeed, went forth with the stars as the Apsaras, his
mates;--'Luminous (bhekuri) by name;'--light-giving (bhâku*ri* <span
id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_393).md) these, indeed, are called, for the
stars give light;--'may he protect this our priesthood and nobility!'
the meaning of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:10">9:4:1:10</span></span>10.
'The Agile,'--that is, the swift,--'all-expansive,'--for the wind (air),
indeed, makes up all this expanse;--'Vâta (the wind) is the Gandharva:
his Apsaras are the waters,'--for as a Gandharva the wind, indeed, went
forth with the waters as the Apsaras, his mates;--'Viands (ûr*g*) by
name,'--the waters, indeed, are called 'ûr*g*a*h*,' for food is produced
from the waters;--'may he protect this our priesthood and nobility!' the
meaning of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:11">9:4:1:11</span></span>11.
'The beneficent, well-winged,'--beneficent (bhu*g*yu <span
id="fr_400"></span>[2](#fn_394).md) indeed is the sacrifice, for the
sacrifice benefits all beings,--'Ya*gñ*a (the sacrifice) is the
Gandharva: his Apsaras are the offering-gifts,'--for as a Gandharva the
sacrifice, indeed, went forth, with the offering-gifts as the Apsaras,

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

his mates;--'Praises (stâvâ) by name,'--the offering-gifts are indeed
praises, for the sacrifice is praised for offering-gifts; and whosoever
gives an offering-gift (to priests) is praised;--'may he protect this
our priesthood and nobility!' the meaning of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:12">9:4:1:12</span></span>12.
'The lord of creatures, the all-worker,'--Pra*g*âpati (lord of
creatures) is indeed the all-worker, for he has wrought all this
(universe);--'Manas (the mind) is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the
hymn-verses and hymn-tunes,'--as a Gandharva, the Mind indeed went
forth, with the hymn-verses and hymn-tunes as the Apsaras, his
mates;--'Wishes (esh*t*i) by name,'--the hymn-verses and hymn-tunes are
indeed wishes, for by verses and tunes people pray, 'May this accrue
unto us! may it fare thus with us!'--'may he protect this our priest and
nobility!' 'the meaning of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:13">9:4:1:13</span></span>13. He
then makes an offering on the Head of the Chariot;--this, indeed, is
that very rite of consecration,--and by that he is now
consecrated,--which this (Sacrificer) is permitted to perform by those
deities with whose permission he is consecrated <span
id="fr_401"></span>[1](#fn_395.md); for he alone becomes king whom the
(other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, and not he whom (they
do) not (allow to assume it). With ghee taken in five ladlings (he
offers), and this is offered as five oblations: the significance of this
has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:14">9:4:1:14</span></span>14. On
the head (or front part of the chariot the

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

offering is made), for it is from the head (downwards) that he who is
anointed is anointed,--whilst it is held above (the Âhavanîya), for
above (others) is he who is thus anointed;--with the same formula
(repeated each time), for one and the same (person) is he who is thus
anointed;--whilst taking round (the chariot-head) in every
direction <span id="fr_402"></span>[1](#fn_396.md): on every side he thus
is anointed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:15">9:4:1:15</span></span>15.
And, again, as to why he makes offering on the head of the chariot;--it
is because this chariot is yonder sun; for it was by assuming that form
that Pra*g*âpati enclosed those couples, and took them to himself, and
made them his own; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby
enclose them, and take them to himself, and make them his own. Whilst it
(the chariot-head) is held above (the fire, he offers), for above
(others) was he who, enclosing those couples, took them to himself, and
made them his own;--and with the same formula, for one and the same is
he who, by enclosing those couples, took them to himself, and made them
his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:1:16">9:4:1:16</span></span>16.
\[He offers each time, with, Vâ*g*. S. XVIII, 44\], 'O Lord of the
world, Lord of creatures!'--for this (Agni), indeed, is the lord of the
world, and the lord of creatures;--'thou whose dwellings are on high, or
here below,'--both on high and

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

here below, indeed, are his dwellings;--'to this priesthood and this
nobility of ours,'--for this Agni is both the priesthood and the
nobility,--'grant thou mighty protection, hail!'--that is, 'grant thou
powerful protection!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_389"></span>[230:1](sbe4339.htm#fr_395.md) This is apparently
intended as an etymological explanation of the two names; Apsaras being
taken as derived from 'apsas,' in the sense of 'beauty.' Cf. Weber, Ind.
Stud. XIII, p. 135, note 3.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[230:2](sbe4339.htm#fr_396.md) Or, perhaps, 'he
places the male above (the female) in respect of power;' see [p.
133](sbe4327.htm#page_133), note [1](sbe4327.htm#fn_237.md).

<span id="fn_391"></span>[231:1](sbe4339.htm#fr_397.md) In accordance with
the preceding paragraph, that part of the formula which relates to the
male deity, viz. 'The law-upholding, law-abiding Agni is the
Gandharva--may he protect this our priesthood and nobility: to him
Svâhâ! Vâ*t*!' is to be uttered first, and the first oblation to be
offered at the call 'Vâ*t*,' i.e. Vasha*t*, 'may he (Agni) carry it (to
the gods)!' Then that part relating to the female deities is uttered,
after which the second oblation is offered. In the same way the other
five formulas are to be treated. See Mahîdhara's remarks on the present
formula.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[231:2](sbe4339.htm#fr_398.md) Â-yuvânâ*h*,
literally 'holding to each other,' a wrong etymology of 'âyu,' 'lively.'

<span id="fn_393"></span>[232:1](sbe4339.htm#fr_399.md) This etymological
explanation of 'bhekuri' is doubtful.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[232:2](sbe4339.htm#fr_400.md) The real meaning of
bhu*g*yu in this passage is very doubtful; while it usually means
'flexible,' the St. Petersburg Dictionary here tentatively assigns to it
the meaning 'adder.' Whether the author of the Brâhma*n*a really
connects it with 'bhu*g* (bhunakti),' 'to enjoy, benefit' (instead of
with 'bhu*g*,' 'to bend'); or whether the explanation is merely meant as
an etymological play of words, is not clear. Mahîdhara indeed derives it
from the former root, in the sense of 'to protect.' The order of the
words 'ya*gñ*o vai bhu*g*yu*h*' would properly require to be rendered
by--The 'bhu*g*yu' doubtless is the sacrifice.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[233:1](sbe4339.htm#fr_401.md) The construction of
the text (occurring again at [IX, 4, 4, 8](sbe4342.htm#9:4:4:8).md) is
rather irregular.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[234:1](sbe4339.htm#fr_402.md) The body (or
'nest,' seat-part) of the chariot is shifted sunwise round the fire on
the great altar, so that the fore-part keeps over the fire where the
Adhvaryu's assistant holds it, and in each of the four directions, as
well as in the centre of the fire, the Adhvaryu offers a libation of
ghee, whilst facing the chariot-head. According to a comment on the
respective rules (Kâty. XVIII, 5, 17-20) alluded to by Prof. Weber (Ind.
Stud. XIII, p. 286), the fore-part of the chariot would, however, seem
to be taken off the seat-part; the latter being carried round the fire
as the oblations are made.
