### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:1">10:3:5:1</span></span>1. Now,
the Ya*g*us, indeed, is he who blows here, for even whilst passing along
he (Vâyu, the wind) generates (vivifies) everything here, and after him
passing along everything is generated: this is why the Ya*g*us is no
other than Vâyu.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:2">10:3:5:2</span></span>2. And
the course <span id="fr_657"></span>[1](#fn_647) (*g*û*h*.md) is this
space, to wit, this air <span id="fr_658"></span>[2](#fn_648.md), for along
this space it (the wind) courses; and the Ya*g*us is both the wind and
the air--the 'yat' and the '*g*û*h*'--whence (the name) Ya*g*us. And the
'yat' (that which goes) is this (Adhvaiyu) <span
id="fr_659"></span>[3](#fn_649), for when he 'goes' on (performing.md), the
*Rik* and Sâman carry that Ya*g*us established on the *Rik* and Sâman.
Hence the Adhvaryu performs his work with the very same Grahas (cups of
Soma), (while) there are each time <span id="fr_660"></span>[4](#fn_650.md)
different stotras (chants) and *s*astras (recitations): it is just as
if, after driving with a first pair (of horses), one drives with a
second pair.

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:3">10:3:5:3</span></span>3. Now
Agni is in front <span id="fr_661"></span>[1](#fn_651) (puras.md), for
placing Agni in front (of them) these creatures attend upon him; and the
sun is motion (*k*ara*n*a), for as soon as he rises everything here
moves about. Such is the Ya*g*us with the preparatory performance
(pura*sk*ara*n*a <span id="fr_662"></span>[2](#fn_652).md) as regards the
deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:4">10:3:5:4</span></span>4. Now
as regards the body. The Ya*g*us is the breath, for whilst moving (yat)
it generates (vivifies) everything here, and along with the moving
breath birth takes place here: hence the Ya*g*us is the breath.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:5">10:3:5:5</span></span>5. And
this course (*g*û*h*) is space--this space which is inside the body--for
along this space it (the breath) courses; and the Ya*g*us is both the
breath and space,--the 'yat' and the '*g*û*h*': hence 'ya*g*us.' And the
'yat' (moving) is the breath, for the breath moves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:6">10:3:5:6</span></span>6. The
Ya*g*us, indeed, is food, for by food one is produced, and by food one
moves. And food carries along that Ya*g*us established on food, whence
even different food is introduced into the same (channel of the) breath.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:7">10:3:5:7</span></span>7. And
the Mind is in front (puras), for the mind is the first of vital airs;
and the eye is motion (*k*ara*n*a), for it is in accordance with the eye
that this

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

body moves. Such is the Ya*g*us with the preparatory performance, firmly
established both as regards the deity and the body; and, indeed,
whosoever thus knows this Ya*g*us with the preparatory performance to be
firmly established both as regards the deity and the body,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:8">10:3:5:8</span></span>8. He,
indeed, reaches successfully the end of the sacrifice, unscathed and
uninjured: he who knows this becomes the first, the leader
(pura-et*ri*), of his own people, an eater of food (i.e. prosperous),
and a ruler.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:9">10:3:5:9</span></span>9. And
if any one strives to become a rival <span
id="fr_663"></span>[1](#fn_653.md) among his own people to one who knows
this, he does not satisfy his dependants; but, indeed, only he satisfies
his dependants, who is faithful <span id="fr_664"></span>[2](#fn_654.md) to
that one and who, along with him, strives to support his dependants.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:10">10:3:5:10</span></span>10.
And this is the greatest Brahman (n., mystic science), for than this
there is no thing greater; and, he who knows this, being himself the
greatest, becomes the highest among his own people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:11">10:3:5:11</span></span>11.
This Brahman has nothing before it and nothing after it <span
id="fr_665"></span>[3](#fn_655.md); and whosoever thus knows this Brahman
to have nothing before it and nothing

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

after it, than he there is no one higher among his equals in station;
and ever higher will be the descendants that spring from him. Wherefore,
if any one would be greater than he, let him reverentially approach the
regions in front (to the eastward) of that one in this way, and he will
do him no injury <span id="fr_666"></span>[1](#fn_656.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:12">10:3:5:12</span></span>12.
But, indeed, the mystic import (upanishad) is the essence of this
Ya*g*us; and thus, if, with ever so small a ya*g*us-formula, the
Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, that (essence) is equal to both the Stotra
and the *S*astra, and comes up to both the Stotra and the *S*astra:
hence, however small the essence (flavour) of food, it benefits (renders
palatable) the whole food, and pervades the whole food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:13">10:3:5:13</span></span>13.
Satiation (contentment), doubtless, is the successful issue thereof (to
wit, of food, and the Ya*g*us): hence when one is satiated by food he
feels like one who has succeeded. And joy, the knowledge thereof (viz.
of the essence, the mystic import), is its soul (self); and, assuredly,
all the gods are of joyful soul; and this, the true knowledge, belongs
to the gods alone,--and, indeed, whosoever knows this is not a man, but
one of the gods.

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:14">10:3:5:14</span></span>14.
And Priyavrata Rauhi*n*âyana, knowing this (truth), once spake unto the
blowing wind, 'Thy soul <span id="fr_667"></span>[1](#fn_657.md) is joy:
blow thou either hither or thither!' and so, indeed, it now blows.
Wherefore, if one desire to invoke any blessing from the gods, let him
approach them with this, 'Your soul is joy,--my wish is such and such:
let it be fulfilled unto me!' and whatever the wish he entertains, it
will be fulfilled to him; for, assuredly, he who knows this attains this
contentment, this successful issue, this joy, this soul.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:15">10:3:5:15</span></span>15.
This Ya*g*us is silent <span id="fr_668"></span>[2](#fn_658.md),
indistinct; for the Ya*g*us is the breath, and the breath is of silent
(secret) abode; and if any one were to say of that (Adhvaryu) who
pronounces (the Ya*g*us) distinctly, 'He has uttered distinctly the
indistinct deity: his breath shall fail him!' then that would, indeed,
come to pass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:5:16">10:3:5:16</span></span>16.
And, assuredly, he who knows the indistinct (secret) manifestation of
this (Ya*g*us) becomes manifest in fame and glory. Silently the Adhvaryu
draws the cup of Soma with the (muttered) Ya*g*us, and, when drawn and
deposited, it becomes manifest;--silently he builds the fire-altar with
the Ya*g*us, and, when built and completed, it becomes
manifest;--silently he takes out (material for) the oblation with the
Ya*g*us, and, when cooked and ready (for offering), it becomes manifest:
thus, whatever he performs silently, when performed and completed, it
becomes manifest. And, assuredly, he who thus knows this secret
manifestation of this

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Ya*g*us) becomes
manifest in fame, and glory, and sanctity; and quickly, indeed, he
becomes known: he becomes the Ya*g*us itself, and by the Ya*g*us people
call him <span id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_659.md).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_647"></span>[336:1](sbe4360.htm#fr_657.md) '*G*û*h*' would
rather seem to mean 'the urger, or speeder.'

<span id="fn_648"></span>[336:2](sbe4360.htm#fr_658.md) 'Yad idam
antariksham,' perhaps, with the double sense--'this air is the "yat (the
going, moving thing)"'--made use of in the sequel. The construction,
however, is not quite clear. Sâya*n*a explains: ayam evâkâ*s*o *g*ûr
iti; *g*u iti sautro dhâtur gatyartha*h*; yad idam pratîyamânam
antariksham asti tad eva *g*ûr iti; yad evo*k*yate--etam âkâ*s*am
anulakshya *g*avate, vâyur ga*kkh*ati, vâyu*g*avamâdakara*n*a--tvâ*g*
*g*ûr âkâ*s*a*h*.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[336:3](sbe4360.htm#fr_659.md) Or, whence (the
name) Ya*g*us, to wit, this (Adhvaryu).

<span id="fn_650"></span>[336:4](sbe4360.htm#fr_660.md) That is, in
different Soma-sacrifices.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[337:1](sbe4360.htm#fr_661.md) Literally,
apparently, 'The in-front is Agni.'

<span id="fn_652"></span>[337:2](sbe4360.htm#fr_662.md) This term,
literally, 'moving in front,' seems virtually to imply the entire manual
work connected with the sacrifice, and which, along with the muttering
of the Ya*g*us-formulas, forms the official duty of the Adhvaryu. It
would thus include all the sacrificial performances prior to the
muttering of a Ya*g*us, as the finishing or consecratory rite. For a
somewhat similar discussion, see IV, 6, 7, 20. 21. The commentary
introduces the present discussion thus: atha brâhma*n*âparanâmadheyasya
pura*sk*ara*n*a*s*abdasya pûrvavan nirva*k*anapura*h*saram adhidaivam
artham âha.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[338:1](sbe4360.htm#fr_663.md) Or, tries to make
opposition, as Sâya*n*a takes it--ya*h* purusha*h* sveshu madhye
eva*m*vidam uktavidyâ*m* *g*ânâna*m* purusha*m* pratibubhûshati (!)
prâtikûlyam â*k*aritum i*kkh*ati.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[338:2](sbe4360.htm#fr_664.md) Thus 'anu-bhû' is
taken by the St. Petersb. Dict. ('to serve, be helpful to'), and by
Sâya*n*a--'yas tv eva*m*vidam anukûlayet sa poshyân poshayitu*m*
*s*aknoti.'

<span id="fn_655"></span>[338:3](sbe4360.htm#fr_665.md) Sâya*n*a seems to
take 'aparavat' in the sense of 'it has (only) something after
it'--srash*t*avya*g*agadrûpâparavat--and the use of the word
'aparapurushâ*h* (descendants)' immediately after might indeed seem to
favour that interpretation.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[339:1](sbe4360.htm#fr_666.md) The MISS. of the
commentary (I. O. 613. 149) are unfortunately not in a very satisfactory
condition:--sa yo haitad iti, evam upâsîtety artha*h*; yadi veditu*h*
sakâ*s*ât gyâyasa*h* purushasya sadbhâve tadâ svayam bâdhyo bhavatîty
â*s*aṅkya tasmâd adhikapurushâd adhikam (a*kh*âdikât B) \[vastu
di*s*yopâsîtavyam (!) ity âha, yo<sup>ऽ</sup>smâ*g* *g*yâyân iti; yadi
asmâd upâsakât yo<sup>ऽ</sup>dhika*h* syât tarhi tasmâd adhikât, om. B\]
di*s*a*h* pûrvâ ity upâsîta; tata*h* *g*yâyaso<sup>ऽ</sup>pi
*g*yâya-upâsane svasyâdhikyât bâdhako nâsti*t*y artha*h*. The commentary
would thus seem to take it to mean that by showing reverence to
something before, or higher than, his rival, he would turn aside his
schemes.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[340:1](sbe4360.htm#fr_667.md) Or, thine own self,
thy nature--tavâtmâ svarûpam. Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[340:2](sbe4360.htm#fr_668.md) That is, pronounced
in an undertone, muttered.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[341:1](sbe4360.htm#fr_669.md) Ya*g*ushaivainam
â*k*akshata iti *gñ*ât*rigñ*eyayor abhedopa*k*âre*n*a tasya vidusha eva
ya*g*u*h* tasya vyavahâryatvam bhavatîty artha*h*. Sâya*n*a.
