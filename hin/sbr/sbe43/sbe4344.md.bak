### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:1">9:5:2:1</span></span>1. Indra
saw this seven-versed (hymn, suitable) for making good what is
deficient <span id="fr_514"></span>[1](#fn_506.md), for reducing what is
redundant, and for perfecting what is imperfect. And, indeed, after
building the fire-altar, one is (still) apt to get into trouble, or to
stumble, or what not. Now, when *S*yâpar*n*a Sâyakâyana heard this, he
ventured upon this performance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:2">9:5:2:2</span></span>2. Now,
there is here a perfecting of three things,--the perfecting of the
fire-altar, the perfecting of

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

him who has it built for him, and the perfecting of him who builds it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:3">9:5:2:3</span></span>3. Thus,
when he reverently stands by (the altar) with this (hymn), everything is
thereby made good <span id="fr_515"></span>[1](#fn_507.md) for him that,
knowing or unknowing, he either does in excess, or does not carry to the
end, in this building of the altar--in short, whatever was not secured
for him. And whatever wish there is in that anush*t*ubh verse <span
id="fr_516"></span>[2](#fn_508.md), that he secures even now; and,
moreover, he thereby keeps off the fiends, the Rakshas, from this sacred
work, and they do not wreck him, whilst uttering imprecations. Wherefore
one who knows this may readily build a fire-altar even for an enemy, for
he is able to gain the better of him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:4">9:5:2:4</span></span>4. \[He
approaches reverently the fire-altar <span
id="fr_517"></span>[3](#fn_509.md), with, Vâ*g*. S. XVIII, 68-74\], 'For
mighty strength that smiteth V*ri*tra, and for victory in battle, we
call thee hither, O Indra!' 'O much-invoked Indra, crush thou the
handless Ku*n*âru, lurking here, together with the Dânus; and with might
smite thou the footless V*ri*tra, the ever-growing mocker!' thus he
reverently stands by (the fire) with the first two (verses) relating to
the slaying of V*ri*tra. For now the gods, having warded off V*ri*tra,
evil, performed this rite freed from evil; and in like manner does the
Sacrificer, having warded off V*ri*tra, evil, now perform this rite
freed from evil.

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:5">9:5:2:5</span></span>5.
'Scatter thou our scorners, O Indra <span
id="fr_518"></span>[1](#fn_510.md)!'Like a terrible, creeping beast,
dwelling in the mountains, hast thou come from the farthest distance:
having sharpened thy pointed, piercing thunderbolt <span
id="fr_519"></span>[2](#fn_511.md), O Indra, beat thou off the foes, and
scatter the spurners!' thus with the second two (verses) relating to
(Indra) Vim*ri*dh <span id="fr_520"></span>[3](#fn_512.md). For now the
gods, having warded off the spurners, evil, performed this rite freed
from evil; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, having warded off
the spurners, evil, now perform this rite freed from evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:6">9:5:2:6</span></span>6. 'May
Agni Vai*s*vânara come forward from afar to our help, to hear our hymns
of praise!'--'Sought after in the sky, sought after on earth, Agni,
sought after, hath entered all the plants: Agni Vai*s*vânara, sought
after, may guard us from injury by day and by night!' thus with the
third two (verses) relating to (Agni) Vai*s*vânara. For now the gods,
having, by Vai*s*vânara, burnt out evil, performed this rite, freed from
evil; and in like manner does the . Sacrificer now, by Vai*s*vânara,
burn out evil, and perform this rite freed from evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:7">9:5:2:7</span></span>7. 'May
we obtain this wish, O Agni, with thy help! may we obtain, O wealthy
one, wealth with abundant heroes! striving for strength, may we obtain
strength; may we obtain undecaying glory, O thou ever-young!' thus with
one (verse) containing wishes. For now

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

the gods, having, by the six-versed (hymn), warded off evil, made once
for all, by the one wish-holding (verse), all (objects of) wishes their
own; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, having, by the
six-versed (hymn), warded off evil, make once for all, by the one
wish-holding (verse), all wishes his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:8">9:5:2:8</span></span>8. It is
(a hymn) of seven verses,--the fire-altar consists of seven layers, (and
there are) seven seasons, seven regions, seven worlds of the gods, seven
stomas, seven p*ri*sh*th*a (sâmans), seven metres, seven domestic
animals, seven wild ones, seven vital airs in the head, and whatever
else there is of seven kinds, relating to deities and relating to the
self,--all that he thereby secures. They become equal to the
Anush*t*ubh <span id="fr_521"></span>[1](#fn_513.md), for the Anush*t*ubh
is speech, and it is by speech that he secures for him (Agni) all that
which is not yet secured for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:9">9:5:2:9</span></span>9. 'Let
him approach (the fire-altar) with an eight-versed (hymn)!' say
some;--'with (Vâ*g*. S. XVIII, 75), "We thereby offer unto thee thy
wish, reverently approaching thee with open hands: with holiest mind and
peaceful thought offer thou sacrifice unto the gods as priest, O Agni!"
thus with a second wish-holding one,--and the seven foregoing ones, that
makes eight,--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and Agni is of
Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so
much he thus secures for him

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

whatsoever is not yet secured for him; and thus, moreover, the two
deities <span id="fr_522"></span>[1](#fn_514) receive the same (amount.md)
for their share.' Let him, however, not do so, for surely those seven
(verses) are (equal to) eight anush*t*ubh (verses), and thus he even
therein obtains whatever wished-for object there is in the eight-versed
(hymn).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:10">9:5:2:10</span></span>10.
With (verses) addressed to Indra and Agni he approaches (the fire);--the
fire-altar belongs to Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as
is his measure, by so much he thus gains for him whatever has not been
gained for him. And Indra and Agni are all the gods, and the fire-altar
belongs to (or Agni is) all the deities: as great as Agni is, as great
as is his measure, by so much he thus gains for him whatever has not
been gained for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:11">9:5:2:11</span></span>11. Now
some make this (hymn) the opening rite of every performance, saying,
'Freed from evil, we must perform this sacred work!' And others, indeed,
say, 'Let him approach reverently (each) layer when it is covered with
soil, for therein that (layer) becomes whole and complete.' Let him,
then, do as he chooses. So much as to the building; now as to the
non-building.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:12">9:5:2:12</span></span>12.
Verily, there are three oceans,--the Fire-altar (being the ocean) of
Ya*g*us-formulas, the Mahâvrata (-sâman) <span
id="fr_523"></span>[2](#fn_515) that of Sâmans (hymn-tunes.md), and the
Mahad uktham (Great Litany <span id="fr_524"></span>[3](#fn_516).md) that
of *Rik* (verses). Whoever performs these (three rites) for another

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

person causes these oceans to dry up for himself, and after them, thus
drying up, the metres <span id="fr_525"></span>[1](#fn_517.md) dry up for
him; and after the metres the world; and after the world his own self;
and after his own self his children and cattle: indeed, he who performs
these for another person becomes poorer day after day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:13">9:5:2:13</span></span>13. And
he who, not having performed these (rites) for another person, were to
officiate in the performance even of all other sacrifices, for him the
metres again replenish themselves from out of those oceans, and after
the metres the world, and after the world his own self, and after his
own self his children and cattle: indeed, he who does not perform those
rites for another person, becomes more prosperous day after day. For,
indeed, these (rites) are his divine, immortal body; and he who performs
them for another person, makes over to another his divine body, and a
withered trunk is all that remains.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:14">9:5:2:14</span></span>14.
Now, some (say), 'Having performed them for another person, they either
perform them for themselves or cause them to be performed again: this is
the atonement.' But let him not do this, for it would be as if one were
to water a withered trunk; it would rot and die: let him know that there
is no atonement for such an one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:5:2:15">9:5:2:15</span></span>15. And
*S*â*nd*ilya once upon a time said--Tura Kâvasheya once built a
fire-altar for the gods at Kârotî. The gods asked him, 'Sage, seeing
that they declare the building of the fire-altar not to be conducive to
heaven, why then hast thou built one?'

16\. He said, 'What is conducive to heaven,

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

and what is not conducive thereto? The Sacrificer is the body of the
sacrifice, and the officiating priests are the limbs; and, surely, where
the body is there are the limbs; and where the limbs are there is the
body. And, verily, if the priests have no place in heaven, then the
Sacrificer has none, for both are of the same world. But let there be no
bargaining as to sacrificial fees, for by bargaining the priests are
deprived of their place in heaven.'

<span id="fn_509"></span>[275:3](sbe4344.htm#fr_517.md) According to Kâty.
*S*r. XVII, 7, 1, this ceremony should take place on the completion of
each layer, after it has been covered with loose earth; cf. [paragraph
11](sbe4344.htm#9:5:2:11.md).

<span id="fn_510"></span>[276:1](sbe4344.htm#fr_518.md) For the complete
verse, see IV, 6, 4, 4.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[276:3](sbe4344.htm#fr_520.md) That is, the
repeller of spurners, or enemies.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[277:1](sbe4344.htm#fr_521.md) The seven verses
consist of two Gâyatrîs (twenty-four syllables each), four Trish*t*ubhs
(forty-four each), and one Anush*t*ubh (thirty-two syllables). Whilst
the two Gâyatrîs are sixteen syllables short of two Anush*t*ubhs, the
four Trish*t*ubhs have forty-eight syllables in excess of four
Anush*t*ubhs. Hence the seven verses consist of 8 × 32 syllables, or
eight Anush*t*ubhs.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[278:1](sbe4344.htm#fr_522.md) Viz. Indra and
