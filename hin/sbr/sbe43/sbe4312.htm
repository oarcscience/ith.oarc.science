<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:1">8:3:2:1</A></FONT></span>1. He then lays down a Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>yotis (all-light brick). Now the middle Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>yotis is V&acirc;yu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for V&acirc;yu (the wind) is all the light in the air-world: it is V&acirc;yu he thus places therein. He places it so as not to be separated from the regional (bricks): he thus places V&acirc;yu in the regions, and hence there is wind in all the regions.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:2">8:3:2:2</A></FONT></span>2. And, again, as to why he lays down the Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>yotis,--the Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>yotis, doubtless, is offspring (or creatures), for offspring indeed is all the light: he thus lays generative power (into that world). He places it so as not to be separated from the regional ones&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: he thus places creatures in the regions, and hence there are creatures in all the regions.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:3">8:3:2:3</A></FONT></span>3. [He lays it down, with, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIV, 14], 'May Vi<I>s</I>vakarman settle thee!' for Vi<I>s</I>vakarman saw this third layer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>;--'on the back of the air, thee the brilliant one!' for on the back of the air that brilliant V&acirc;yu indeed is.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:4">8:3:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. 'For all up-breathing, down-breathing, through-breathing,'--for the Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>yotis is breath,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and breath indeed is (necessary) for this entire universe;--'give all the light!'--that is, 'give the whole light;'--'V&acirc;yu is thine over-lord,'--it is V&acirc;yu he thus makes the over-lord of that (layer and the air-world). Having settled it, he pronounces the S&ucirc;dadohas over it: the significance of this has been explained.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:5">8:3:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. He then lays down two Ritavy&acirc; (seasonal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> bricks);--the two seasonal ones being the same as the seasons, it is the seasons he thus places therein.[V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIV, 15], 'Nabha and Nabhasya, the two rainy seasons,' these are the names of those two (bricks): it is by their names he thus lays them down. There are two (such) bricks, for a season consists of two months. He settles them once only: he thereby makes (the two months) one season. He places them on avak&acirc;-plants and covers them</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A></p>  
<p>with avak&acirc;-plants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for avak&acirc;-plants mean water he thus bestows water on that season, whence it rains most abundantly in that season.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:6">8:3:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. Then the two upper ones, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIV, I6), 'Isha and &Ucirc;r<I>g</I>a, the two autumnal seasons,'--these are the names of those two (bricks): it is by their names he thus lays them down. There are two (such) bricks, for a season consists of two months. He settles them only once: he thereby makes (the two months) one season. He places them on avak&acirc;-plants, for the avak&acirc;-plants mean water: he thus bestows water before that season, whence it rains before that season. He does not cover them afterwards, whence it does not likewise rain after (that season).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:7">8:3:2:7</A></FONT></span>7. And as to why he places these (four bricks) in this (layer),--this fire-altar is the year, and the year is the same as these worlds, and the middlemost layer is the air (-world) thereof; and the rainy season and autumn are the air (-world) thereof: hence when he places them in this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Agni) what (part) of his body these (formed),--this is why he places them in this (layer).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:8">8:3:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. And, again, as to why he places them in this (layer),--this Agni (the fire-altar) is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the year. Now the middlemost layer is the middle of this (altar), and the rainy season and the autumn are the middle of that (year): hence when he places them in this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Agni-Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati) what part of his</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A></p>  
<p>body these (formed),--this is why he places them in this (layer).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:9">8:3:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. There are here four seasonal (bricks) he lays down in the middlemost layer; and two in each of the other layers,--animals (cattle) are four-footed, and the middlemost layer is the air: he thus places animals in the air, and hence there are animals that have their abode in the air.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:10">8:3:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. And, again, why there are four,--animals are four-footed, and animals are food; and the middle-most layer is the middle (of Agni's body): he thus puts food in the middle.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:11">8:3:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. And, again, why there are four,--'antariksha' (air) consists of four syllables, and the other layers (<I>k</I>iti) consist of two syllables; hence as much as the air consists of, so much he makes it in laying it down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:12">8:3:2:12</A></FONT></span>12. And, again, why there are four,--this Agni (altar), doubtless, is an animal: he thus makes the animal biggest towards the middle; whence an animal is biggest towards the middle.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:13">8:3:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. There are here four <I>Ri</I>tavy&acirc;s, the Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>yotis being the fifth, and five Di<I>s</I>y&acirc;s,--this makes ten: the Vir&acirc;<I>g</I> consists of ten syllables, and the Vir&acirc;<I>g</I> is food, and the middlemost layer is the middle;--he thus puts food in the middle (of the body). He lays them down so as not to be separated from the naturally-perforated one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for the naturally-perforated one is the vital air: he thus places the food so as not to be separated from the vital air. Subsequently (to the central brick) he lays them down: subsequently</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_51"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 51</FONT></A></p>  
<p>to (or upon) the vital air he thus places food.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:3:2:14">8:3:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. He then lays down the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>abh<I>ri</I>t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (bricks);--the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>abh<I>ri</I>ts (breath-holders), doubtless, are the vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus lays into (Agni's body). There are ten of them, for there are ten vital airs. He places them in the forepart (of the altar),--for there are these vital airs in front,--with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIV, 17), 'Protect my vital strength! protect mine up-breathing! protect my down-breathing! protect my through-breathing! protect mine eye! protect mine ear! increase my speech! animate my mind! protect my soul (or body)! give me light!'--He lays them down so as not to be separated from the seasonal ones, for the vital air is wind: he thus establishes the wind in the seasons.</p>

Agni, V&acirc;yu and &Acirc;ditya (S&ucirc;rya). See VI, 3, 3, 16.</P>

<p>These two <I>Ri</I>tavy&acirc;s are placed beside (east of) the Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>yotis, one north of the other, just over those of the first and second layers, that is to say, in the fifth space from the centre.
