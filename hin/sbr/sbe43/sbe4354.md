### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:1">10:2:5:1</span></span>1. Now
as to the building itself. He builds between the two (performances of
the) Upasads <span id="fr_615"></span>[1](#fn_605.md). For at that time the
gods were afraid lest the fiends, the Rakshas, should destroy that
(Agni's body) of theirs (built) there <span
id="fr_616"></span>[2](#fn_606.md). They saw these strongholds, the
Upasads, to wit, these worlds, for these worlds are indeed strongholds.
They entered them, and having entered them, they completed that body in
a place free from danger and devilry; and in like manner does the
Sacrificer now, after entering these strongholds, complete this body in
a place free from danger and devilry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:2">10:2:5:2</span></span>2. And,
again, as to why he builds between the Upasads. At this time the gods
were afraid lest the fiends, the Rakshas, should destroy that (Agni's
body) of theirs (built) there. They saw these thunderbolts, the Upasads,
for the Upasads indeed are thunderbolts: they entered them <span
id="fr_617"></span>[3](#fn_607.md), and, having entered them, they
completed that body in a place free from danger and devilry; and in like
manner does the Sacrificer now, after entering those thunderbolts,

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

complete this body (of Agni) in a place free from danger and devilry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:3">10:2:5:3</span></span>3. And
the Upasads also are the fervour <span id="fr_618"></span>[1](#fn_608.md)
in the sacrifice, for they are indeed fervour; and inasmuch as it is
built (*k*i) in fervour (tapas) it is called 'Tâpa*sk*ita <span
id="fr_619"></span>[2](#fn_609.md).' As long as they perform the Upasads so
long (do they perform) the Pravargya <span
id="fr_620"></span>[3](#fn_610): (if.md) it is for a year. that they
perform the Upasads, it is for a year (they perform) the Pravargya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:4">10:2:5:4</span></span>4. The
Upasads, indeed, are the days and nights, and the Pravargya is the sun:
he thus establishes yonder sun on the days and nights, whence he is
established on the days and nights.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:5">10:2:5:5</span></span>5. And
'if there are twenty-four (Upasad-days <span
id="fr_621"></span>[4](#fn_611).md), there being twenty-four half
moons--the Upasads

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

are the half-moons, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus establishes
yonder sun on the half-moons, whence he is established on the
half-moons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:6">10:2:5:6</span></span>6. And
if there are twelve (Upasad-days) <span
id="fr_622"></span>[1](#fn_612.md)--there being twelve months--the Upasads
are the months, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus establishes yonder
sun on the months, whence he is established on the months.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:7">10:2:5:7</span></span>7. And
if there are six (Upasad-days)--there being six seasons--the Upasads are
the seasons, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus establishes yonder
sun in the seasons, whence he is established in the seasons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:8">10:2:5:8</span></span>8. And
if there are three (Upasad-days)--there being these three worlds--the
Upasads are these three worlds, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus
establishes yonder sun in these worlds, whence he is established in
these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:9">10:2:5:9</span></span>9. Now,
then, the inquiry as to the earth-layers of the altar-pile. One month
(the building of) the first layer (of bricks takes), and one month the
layer of earth <span id="fr_623"></span>[2](#fn_613.md),--so long desire
(lasts) in the spring season (of two months): he thus <span
id="fr_624"></span>[3](#fn_614.md) builds for himself a body so as to
obtain all of whatever desire there is in the spring season <span
id="fr_625"></span>[4](#fn_615.md).

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:10">10:2:5:10</span></span>10.
One month the second (layer of bricks takes), and one month the layer of
earth,--so long desire (lasts) in the summer season: he thus builds for
himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the
summer season.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:11">10:2:5:11</span></span>11.
One month the third (layer of bricks takes), and one month the layer of
earth,--so long desire (lasts) in the rainy season: he thus builds for
himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the
rainy reason.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:12">10:2:5:12</span></span>12.
One month the fourth (layer of bricks takes), and one month the layer of
earth,--so long desire (lasts) in the autumn season: he thus builds for
himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the
autumn season.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:13">10:2:5:13</span></span>13.
And of the fifth layer (of bricks) he lays down the Asapatnâ and Virâ*g*
(bricks) on the first day, and of the Stomabhâgâs one each day: these he
'settles' together once, and pronounces once the sûdadohas-formula over
them <span id="fr_626"></span>[1](#fn_616.md). For a month they silently
apply the earth-layer for the Stomabhâgâs, for so long desire (lasts) in
the winter season: thus he builds for himself a body so as to obtain all
of whatever desire there is in the winter season.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:14">10:2:5:14</span></span>14.
One month the sixth (layer of bricks takes),

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

and one month the layer of earth,--so long desire (lasts) in the dewy
season: he thus builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of
whatever desire there is in the dewy season. So long, indeed, desire
(lasts) in the twelve months and the six seasons: he thus builds for
himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the
twelve months and the six seasons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:15">10:2:5:15</span></span>15.
And in addition to these there are three days <span
id="fr_627"></span>[1](#fn_617.md), to wit, the day on which he performs
the *S*atarudriya offering, the day of preparation, and the day on which
the Soma is pressed. When they perform the Upasad on these days, these
(days) are the days and nights of that (thirteenth, or intercalary)
month: and when (they perform) the Pravargya, he thereby establishes
yonder sun also in that (seventh) season,--so long, indeed, desire
(lasts) in the thirteen months and the seven seasons: he thus builds for
himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in
thirteen months and seven seasons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:5:16">10:2:5:16</span></span>16.
For a year Soma should be pressed,--the year is everything, and the one
hundred and one-fold (altar) is everything: by means of everything he
thus gains everything. Should he be unable (to press Soma) for a year,
he should perform the Vi*s*va*g*it Atirâtra <span
id="fr_628"></span>[2](#fn_618.md) with all the

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
P*ri*sh*th*as <span id="fr_629"></span>[1](#fn_619.md), and at that
(sacrifice) he should give away all his property <span
id="fr_630"></span>[2](#fn_620); for the Vi*s*va*g*it (all-conquering.md)
Atirâtra with all the P*ri*sh*th*as means everything, and all one's
property means everything, and the one hundred and one-fold (altar)
means everything: by means of everything he thus gains everything.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_605"></span>[316:1](sbe4354.htm#fr_615.md) The Upasads (or
sieges) are performed twice a day on at least three days (the regular
number for ordinary one day's Soma-sacrifices) intervening between the
end of the Dîkshâ (initiation) and the day of the Soma-sacrifice; see
part ii, p. 105, note 1. On the first day the first layer is built
between the two performances (whilst the final preparation of the
altar-site, as well as the building of the Gârhapatya altar and the
installation of the Ukhya Agni thereon, takes place before the morning
performance of the Upasads), and on the second day the remaining layers
are built.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[316:2](sbe4354.htm#fr_616.md) For the
construction in the *oratio directa*, see part iii, p. 34, note 2.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[316:3](sbe4354.htm#fr_617.md) Or, they went into
their shelter (pra-pad).

<span id="fn_608"></span>[317:1](sbe4354.htm#fr_618.md) Or, austere
devotion, see III, 4, 4, 27, where fasting during the Upasad days is
recommended as calculated to promote religious fervour. There is also,
however, the primary' meaning 'heat' implied, whence the 'heating' of
the cauldron (gharma--θερμός) at the Pravargya (representing the sun) is
connected with the Upasads.

<span id="fn_609"></span>[317:2](sbe4354.htm#fr_619.md) That is, the
fire-altar used at the sacrificial period (ayana) called Tâpa*sk*ita,
which generally requires a full year (360 days) for the performance of
the Upasads (as do also the Dîkshâ- before them, and the performance of
the Soma-sacrifice after them); cf. XII, 3, 3, 10 seq.; Kâty. XIV, 5,
1.--Â*s*val. XII, 5, 9; Kâty. XXIV, 5, 7, however, mention a Tâpa*sk*ita
which only requires four months for each of the three periods, or a year
altogether, whilst the maximum duration is by Â*s*v. fixed at thirty-six
years (twelve for each period); and by Kâty. at three years for the
Upasads and a year for each of the two other ceremonies.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[317:3](sbe4354.htm#fr_620.md) See part ii, p.
304.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[317:4](sbe4354.htm#fr_621.md) Sâya*n*a does not
specify what sacrificial performance is intended as requiring
twenty-four Upasad-days, but merely says that they are required
'kratuvi*s*eshe,' at some special kind of sacrifice. At all events, the
Sacrificer would be at liberty to adopt that number of Upasad-days
instead of the minimum of days prescribed, if he hoped to derive special
benefit therefrom.

<span id="fn_612"></span>[318:1](sbe4354.htm#fr_622.md) For an ordinary
Ekâha, or one day's Soma-sacrifice, the Upasads may be performed for
twelve days instead of the usual three days (Kâty. VIII, 2, 40). It is
also the regular number of days for Ahînas (ib. XIII, i, x; Â*s*v. IV,
8, 15) and for most sattras.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[318:2](sbe4354.htm#fr_623.md) That is, when the
Upasads last for a whole year, as at the Tâpa*sk*ita.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[318:3](sbe4354.htm#fr_624.md) That is, by
building for his Soma-sacrifice an altar the body of which requires a
whole year in being laid down, as it does in the Tâpa*sk*ita.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[318:4](sbe4354.htm#fr_625.md) Translated
literally, the sentence would run thus: 'Thus as <span id="page_319">p.
319</span> much desire as there is in the spring season--he builds for
himself a body so as to obtain all that (desire).' Only the building of
an altar (body) for a whole year ensures the full fruition of sensual
pleasures supplied during the year.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[319:1](sbe4354.htm#fr_626.md) That is, these
three kinds of bricks--the five Asapatnâs, and forty Virâ*g*s being laid
down on the first day, and of the twenty-nine Stomabhâgâs one each
day,--the three kinds of bricks thus take one month in being laid down,
after which the 'sâdanam' and 'Sûdadohas' (cf. part iii, p. 301, note 3)
are performed upon them.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[320:1](sbe4354.htm#fr_627.md) Viz. after the
twenty-eight days of the twelfth month two days remain to make up the
year, so that the (first) Sutyâ day (pressing day) takes place after the
expiry of a full year.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[320:2](sbe4354.htm#fr_628.md) The Vi*s*va*g*it,
as usually performed, is an Agnish*t*oma sacrifice, the twelve Stotras
of which are chanted in three different stomas or hymn-forms, viz. the
first four in the triv*ri*t (nine-versed), the next four in the
pa*ñk*ada*s*a (fifteen-versed), and the last four in the saptada*s*a
(seventeen-versed) stoma. For the stotriya-texts see <span
id="page_321">p. 321</span> Tâ*nd*ya-Br. XVI, 5, 1 seq. It is closely
united with the Abhi*g*it Soma-day--the stotras of which are performed
in four stomas, viz. three in each of those used for the Vi*s*va*g*it,
and the last three in the ekavi*ms*a, or twenty-one-versed, stoma--with
which it may, indeed, be combined in one and the same performance; and
both form part of the sacrificial session called Gavâm ayanam (part ii,
p. 427). The Vi*s*va*g*it (as well as the Abhi*g*it) may, however, also
be performed as an Atirâtra instead of Agnish*t*oma, and in that case
the sequence of Stomas is entirely different, their order being as
follows: the first four stotras are performed in the first four stomas
(triv*ri*t, pa*ñk*ada*s*a, saptada*s*a, ekavi*ms*a); the next four
stotras in the four stomas beginning with the second stoma (up to
tri*n*ava), and the next four stotras in the four stomas beginning with
the third stoma (up to trayast*rims*a). Of the three Ukthastotras, the
first is performed in the tri*n*ava, and the two others in the
ekavi*ms*a; the Sho*d*a*s*in in its own (ekavi*ms*a) form; the
night-chants in the pa*ñk*ada*s*a; and the twilight-chant in the
triv*ri*t-stoma. See Tâ*nd*ya-Br. XX, 9.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[321:1](sbe4354.htm#fr_629.md) On
'sarvap*ri*sh*th*a' Soma-days, see part iii, introduction, pp. xx seq.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[321:2](sbe4354.htm#fr_630.md) As an equivalent
for one's 'whole property (sarvavedasa, sarvasva),' Kâtyâyana (XXII, 2,
26. 27) enumerates 'cows, oxen, ploughs, sacks of corn (or corn-sacks),
pairs of slaves, waggons, animals for riding, houses (or sheds), and
couches.' For other similar enumerations, see A. Weber, Omina and
Portenta (Abb. of Berl. Acad. 1858), p. 398.
