### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:4:1">10:6:4:1</span></span>1.
Verily, the dawn is the head of the sacrificial horse <span
id="fr_829"></span>[1](#fn_816), the sun its eye, the wind its breath,
Agni Vai*s*vânara (the fire belonging to all men) its open mouth. The
year is the body of the sacrificial horse, the sky its back, the air its
belly, the earth the under part of its belly, the quarters its flanks,
the intermediate quarters its ribs, the seasons its limbs, the months
and half-months its joints, the days and nights its feet, the stars its
bones, the welkin its flesh, the sand its intestinal food, the rivers
its bowels, the mountains its liver and lungs, the herbs and trees its
hair, the rising sun the forepart, and the setting sun the hindpart of
its body, the lightning its yawning, the thundering its whinnying, the
raining its voiding urine, and speech its voice. The day, indeed, was
produced as the Mahiman <span id="fr_830"></span>[2](#fn_817) (cup)
before the horse, and its birthplace is in the eastern sea. The night
was produced as the Mahiman (cup) behind (or after) it, and its
birth-place was in the western sea: these two Mahiman (cups), indeed,
came to be on both sides of the horse. As Haya (steed) it carried the
gods, as Va*g*in (racer) the Gandharvas, as Aryan (courser) the Asuras,
as A*s*va (horse) men. The sea, indeed, is its kindred, the sea its
birth-place.
