### THE FIFTH LAYER.

#### FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:1">8:5:1:1</span></span>1. He
lays down the fifth layer. For now, having laid down the fourth layer,
the gods mounted it,--having completed what is above the air, and below
the sky, they mounted it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:2">8:5:1:2</span></span>2. They
spake, 'Meditate ye (*k*etay)!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say,
'Seek ye a layer (*k*iti)! Seek ye from hence upwards!' Whilst
meditating, they saw that fifth layer, the far-shining heaven: that
world pleased them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:3">8:5:1:3</span></span>3. They
desired, 'Would that we could make that world foeless, undisturbed!'
They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how we shall make this world

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

foeless, undisturbed!' They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed, they
meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! Seek ye how we shall make this world
foeless, undisturbed!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:4">8:5:1:4</span></span>4. Whilst
meditating, they saw these Asapatnâ ('foeless') bricks; they laid them
down, and by means of them they made that world foeless, undisturbed;
and because by means of them they made that world foeless, undisturbed,
these (are called) Asapatnâs. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, by
laying them down, now make that world foeless, undisturbed. On all
(four) sides he lays them down: on all sides he thus makes that world
foeless, undisturbed. He places them on the other side: he thereby makes
that whole world foe-less, undisturbed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:5">8:5:1:5</span></span>5. He
then lays down the Virâ*g*s <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_168.md)
(far-shining bricks): this Virâ*g*, indeed, is that far-shining
(virâ*g*) fifth layer which the gods saw. He lays them down by tens: the
Virâ*g* (metre) consists of ten syllables, and this layer is 'virâ*g*.'
He places them on every side; for he who shines (rules) in one direction
only, does not shine far and wide, but whosoever shines in all
directions, he alone shines far and wide.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:6">8:5:1:6</span></span>6. And as
to why he lays down those Asapatnâs. Now at that time, when that (part)
of his body had been restored, evil beset Pra*g*âpati on every side. He
saw those foeless bricks, and laid them down, and by means of them he
drove off evil, for foe means evil; and because, by means of them he
drove off the foe, evil, therefore they are (called) 'foeless' (bricks).

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:7">8:5:1:7</span></span>7. And
what the gods did, the same is done now. Evil, indeed, does not now
beset this (Sacrificer), but when he now does this, it is that he wants
to do what the gods did; and he thereby drives off whatever evil,
whatever foe besets him; and because, by means of them, he drives off
the foe, evil, therefore they are (called) the 'foeless' (bricks). He
places them on every side: he thereby drives off the foe, evil, on every
side. He places them on the other side: from his whole self he thereby
drives off the foe, evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:8">8:5:1:8</span></span>8. He
lays down (one) in front <span id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_169.md), with
(Vâ*g*. S. XV, 1), 'O Agni, drive away the foes of ours that are born,
drive back those unborn, O knower of beings! cheer us, kindly and
un-frowning! may we be in thy threefold-sheltering, steadfast
protection!' as the text so the sense. Then behind, with (Vâ*g*. S. XV,
2), 'With might drive away the foes of ours that are born,

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

drive back, O knower of beings, those unborn! cheer us with kindly
feeling! may we prevail! drive off our foes!' as the text so the sense.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:9">8:5:1:9</span></span>9. That
which is (placed) in front is Agni, and that behind is Agni: with Agni
he (Pra*g*âpati) then drove away evil both in front and in the rear; and
in like manner now does the Sacrificer with Agni drive away evil both in
front and in the rear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:10">8:5:1:10</span></span>10.
Then on the right (south) side, with (Vâ*g*. S. XV, 3), 'The sixteenfold
Stoma, vigour, wealth!' The Trish*t*ubh consists of eleven syllables,
and--the air being of Trish*t*ubh nature--there are (in the air) four
quarters. The thunderbolt is fifteenfold, and yonder sun is the
sixteenfold wielder of that thunderbolt: with that thunderbolt, with
that Trish*t*ubh, he (Pra*g*âpati) drove away evil in the south; and in
like manner does the Sacrificer, with that thunderbolt, with that
Trish*t*ubh, now drive away evil in the south.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:11">8:5:1:11</span></span>11.
Then on the left (north) side, with, 'The forty-four-fold Stoma, lustre,
wealth!' The Trish*t*ubh consists of forty-four syllables, and the
thunderbolt is of Trish*t*ubh nature: with that forty-four-fold
thunderbolt, with that Trish*t*ubh, he (Pra*g*âpati) drove away evil in
the north; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, with that
thunderbolt, with that Trish*t*ubh, now drive away evil in the north.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:12">8:5:1:12</span></span>12.
Then in the middle (the fifth), with, 'Agni's soil-cover thou art!'--the
fourth layer indeed is the Brahman, and the Brahman is Agni, and this,
the fifth layer is, as it were, the (soil-)cover of that (fourth
layer);--'his sap, in truth: may the All-gods sing thy praises! Seat
thee here, laden with Stomas, and rich in fat! Gain for us, by

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

sacrifice, wealth with offspring!' as the text so the sense.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:13">8:5:1:13</span></span>13.
This one he lays down with its line-marks running eastward and
crosswise <span id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_170.md); for by that one
Pra*g*âpati then cut out the root of evil, and in like manner does this
(Sacrificer) now thereby cut out the root of evil. On the right (south)
side (from the centre he places it), for the thunderbolt has a
string <span id="fr_172"></span>[2](#fn_171.md) on the right side;--inside
the one in the southern quarter, for it is for the sake of extension
that he leaves that space.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:14">8:5:1:14</span></span>14. The
one which (lies) in front is the out-breathing, the one at the back the
off-breathing: by the out-breathing he (Pra*g*âpati) then drove away
evil in front, and by the off-breathing in the rear; and in like manner
does the Sacrificer now by the out-breathing drive away evil in front,
and by the off-breathing in the rear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:15">8:5:1:15</span></span>15. And
the two on both sides (of the spine) are the two arms: whatever evil
there was sideways of him, that he drove away with his arms; and in like
manner does this Sacrificer now drive away with his arms whatever evil
there is sideways of him.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:16">8:5:1:16</span></span>16. The
soil-bedded one <span id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_172.md) means food:
whatever evil there was above him, that he (Pra*g*âpati) drove away by
means of food; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, by means of
food, drive away whatever evil there is above him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:1:17">8:5:1:17</span></span>17.
And, verily, whenever he, knowing this, breathes out, he thereby drives
away the evil which is in front of him; and when he breathes backward,
he thereby (drives away) that which is in the rear; and when he does
work with his arms, he thereby (drives away) that which is sideways of
him; and when he eats food, he thereby (drives away) that (evil) which
is above him: at all times, indeed, even while sleeping, does he who
knows this drive away evil. Hence, one must not speak ill of him who
knows this, lest one should be his evil (enemy).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_168"></span>[83:1](sbe4319.htm#fr_169.md) For particulars
respecting these, also called *Kh*andasyâ*h*, see [VIII, 5, 2,
1](sbe4320.htm#8:5:2:1.md), seq.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[84:1](sbe4319.htm#fr_170.md) The first four of
the five Asapatnâs are laid down near the four ends of the spines (in
the order east, west, south, north); their exact place being the second
space on the left side of the spine (in looking towards them from the
centre), that is to say, the space of one (? or half a) foot being left
between them and the respective spine. Their position thus is the same
as those of the Â*s*vinîs in the second layer (see [p.
31](sbe4308.htm#page_31), note [1](sbe4308.htm#fn_85).md) except that these
were placed on the Reta*h*si*k* range instead of at the ends of the
spines. The line-marks of these four bricks run parallel to the
respective spines. The fifth Asapatnâ is thus laid down north of the
southern one, so as to leave the space of a cubit (about a foot and a
half) between them. These latter two Asapatnâs are full-sized bricks
(one foot square), and not half-sized, as were the two southern
Â*s*vinîs. Moreover, whilst the southern Asapatnâ has its line-marks
running parallel to the adjoining cross-spine (south to north), the
fifth Asapatnâ has them running from west to east (? as well as from
south to north).

<span id="fn_170"></span>[86:1](sbe4319.htm#fr_171.md) That is to say,
crosswise, or marked in the opposite direction to the Asapatnâ brick
near it, viz. to the one placed east of the southern end of the
cross-spine which (like all bricks placed between shoulder and thigh)
has its line-marks running from south to north. The fifth Asapatnâ,
lying immediately north of that southern one, thus has its line-marks
parallel, not (as one would expect) to the cross-spine, but to the
further removed spine.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[86:2](sbe4319.htm#fr_172.md) This is a doubtful
rendering of 'udyâma,' which is accepted by the St. Petersb. Dict. for
'sha*d*-udyâma,' at VI, 7, 1, 16, 18; whilst in the present case
'dakshi*n*ata-udyâma' seems to be taken by it to mean southward erected,
southward drawn (aufgespannt).' Udyâma,' in the sense 'extension,' might
mean a protruding part, serving as a handle.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[87:1](sbe4319.htm#fr_173.md) That is, the fifth
Asapatnâ, which has a bed or layer of loose soil (purîsha) spread under
it.
