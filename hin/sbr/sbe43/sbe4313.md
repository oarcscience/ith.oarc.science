### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:3:1">8:3:3:1</span></span>1. He
then lays down the *Kh*andasyâ <span id="fr_121"></span>[2](#fn_120)
(metres’ bricks). Now the metres are cattle, and the middle-most layer
is the air: he thus places cattle in the air, whence cattle have their
abode in the air.

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:3:2">8:3:3:2</span></span>2. And,
again, as to why he lays down *Kh*andasyâs,--the metres are cattle, and
cattle are food, and the middlemost layer is the middle (of Agni, the
altar): he thus places food in the middle (of Agni's body).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:3:3">8:3:3:3</span></span>3. He
lays them down by twelves,--for the *G*agatî consists of twelve
syllables, and the *G*agatî is cattle, and the middlemost layer is the
air: he thus places cattle in the air, whence cattle have their abode in
the air.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:3:4">8:3:3:4</span></span>4. And,
again, why (he lays them down) by twelves,--the *G*agatî consists of
twelve syllables, and the *G*agatî is cattle, and cattle is food, and
the middlemost layer is the middle: he thus places food in the middle.
He places them so as not to be separated from the Prâ*n*abh*ri*ts: he
thus places the food so as not to be separated from the vital airs
subsequently (to them he places them): he thus bestows food after
(bestowing) the vital airs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:3:5">8:3:3:5</span></span>5. \[He
lays down the right set, with, Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 18\], 'The metre
Measure;'--the measure (mâ), doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, for
this world is, as it were, measured (mita);--'the metre
Fore-measure!'--the fore-measure (pramâ), doubtless, is the air-world,
for the air-world is, as it were, measured forward from this
world;--'The metre Countermeasure,'--the counter-measure (pratimâ),
doubtless, is yonder (heavenly) world, for yonder world is, as it were,
counter-measured <span id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_121) in the air;--'The
metre Asrîvayas,'--'asrîvayas,' doubtless, is food: whatever food there
is in these worlds that is 'asrîvayas.' Or, whatever food (anna) flows
(sravati) from these

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

worlds that is 'asrîvayas.' Hereafter, now, he puts down only defined
metres.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:3:6">8:3:3:6</span></span>6. 'The
Paṅkti metre! the Ush*n*ih metre! the B*ri*hatî metre! the Anush*t*ubh
metre! the Virâ*g* metre! the Gâyatrî metre! the Trish*t*ubh metre! the
*G*agatî metre!' these eight defined metres, including the Virâ*g*, he
puts down.--\[The back set, with, Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 19\], 'The metre Earth!
the metre Air! the metre Heaven! the metre Years! the metre Stars! the
metre Speech! the metre Mind! the metre Husbandry! the metre Gold! the
metre Cow! the metre Goat! the metre Horse!' he thus puts down those
metres which are sacred to those particular deities.--\[The left set,
with, Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 20\], 'The deity Fire! the deity Wind! the deity
Sun! the deity Moon! the deity Vasava*h*! the deity Rudrâ*h*! the deity
Âdityâ*h*! the deity Maruta*h*! the deity Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*! the deity
B*ri*haspati! the deity Indra! the deity Varu*n*a!'--these deities,
doubtless, are metres: it is these he thus lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:3:7">8:3:3:7</span></span>7. He
lays down both defined and undefined (metres). Were he to lay down such
as are all defined, then the food would have an end, it would fail; and
(were he to lay down) such as are all undefined, then the food would be
invisible, and one would not see it at all. He lays down both defined
and undefined ones: hence the defined (certain) food which is eaten does
not fail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:3:8">8:3:3:8</span></span>8. These
then are those (sets of) twelve he lays down,--that makes thirty-six,
and the B*ri*hatî consists of thirty-six syllables: this is that same
B*ri*hatî, the air, which the gods then saw as a third

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

layer. In that (b*ri*hatî set of bricks) the gods come last (or, are
highest).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:3:9">8:3:3:9</span></span>9. And,
again, as to why he lays down these bricks. When Pra*g*âpati became
relaxed, all living beings went from him in all directions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:3:10">8:3:3:10</span></span>10. Now
that same Pra*g*âpati who became relaxed is this very Agni (fire-altar)
that is now being built up; and those living beings which went from him
are these bricks: hence when he lays down these (bricks), he thereby
puts back into him (Pra*g*âpati-Agni) those same living beings which
went from him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:3:11">8:3:3:11</span></span>11. Now
when he first lays down ten (Prâ*n*abh*ri*ts), they are the moon. There
are ten of these,--the Virâ*g*; consists of ten syllables, and the
Virâ*g* is food, and the moon is food. And when subsequently he lays
down thirty-six (*Kh*andasyâs), they are the half-months and
months--twenty-four half-months and twelve months: the moon, doubtless,
is the year, and all living beings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:3:12">8:3:3:12</span></span>12. And
when the gods restored him (Pra*g*âpati-Agni), they put all those living
beings inside him, and in like manner does this one now put them
therein. He lays them down so as not to be separated from the seasonal
(bricks): he thus establishes all living beings in the seasons.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_120"></span>[51:2](sbe4313.htm#fr_121) The thirty-six
*Kh*andasyâ bricks are laid down, in three sets of twelve each, along
the edge of the body of the altar where the two wings and the tail join
it; six bricks being placed on each side of the respective spine. At the
back the bricks are not, however, placed close to the edge separating
the body from the tail, but sufficient space is left (a foot wide) for
another set of bricks to be laid down behind the *Kh*andasyâs.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[52:1](sbe4313.htm#fr_122) That is, made a
counterfeit, or copy, of the earth.
