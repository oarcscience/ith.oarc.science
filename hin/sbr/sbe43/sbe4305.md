### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:3:1">8:1:3:1</span></span>1. As to
this they say, 'What are the vital airs (prâ*n*a), and what the
Prâ*n*abh*ri*ta*h*?'--The vital airs are just the vital airs, and the
Prâ*n*abh*ri*ta*h* (holders of the vital airs) are the limbs, for the
limbs do hold the vital airs. But, indeed, the vital airs are the vital
airs, and the Prâ*n*abh*ri*t is food, for food does uphold the vital
airs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:3:2">8:1:3:2</span></span>2. As to
this they say, 'How do all these (Prâ*n*abh*ri*t-bricks) of him (Agni
and the Sacrificer) come to be of Pra*g*âpati's nature?'--Doubtless in
that with all of them he says, 'By thee, taken by Pra*g*âpati:' it is in
this way, indeed, that they all come to be for him of Pra*g*âpati's
nature <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:3:3">8:1:3:3</span></span>3. As to
this they say, 'As they chant and recite for the cup when drawn,
wherefore, then, does he put in verses and hymn-tunes <span
id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56) before (the drawing of) the
cups?'--Doubtless, the completion of the sacrificial work has to be kept
in view;--now with the opening hymn-verse the cup is drawn; and on the
verse (*rik*) the tune (sâman) is sung: this means that he thereby puts
in for him (Agni) both the verses and hymn-tunes before (the drawing of)
the cups. And when after (the drawing of) the cups there are the
chanting (of the Stotra) and the recitation (of the *S*astra): this
means that thereby he puts in for him both the stomas (hymn-forms) and
the p*ri*sh*th*a (sâmans) after (the drawing of) the cups <span
id="fr_57"></span>[3](#fn_57).

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:3:4">8:1:3:4</span></span>4. As to
this they say, 'If these three are done together--the soma-cup, the
chant, and the recitation,--and he puts in only the soma-cup and the
chant, how comes the recitation also in this case to be put (into the
sacrificial work) for him <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58)?' But,
surely, what the chant is that is the recitation <span
id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_59); for on whatsoever (verses) they chant a
tune, those same (verses) he (the Hot*ri*) recites thereafter <span
id="fr_60"></span>[3](#fn_60); and in this way, indeed, the *S*astra
also comes in this case to be put in for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:3:5">8:1:3:5</span></span>5. As to
this they say, 'When he speaks first of three in the same way as of a
father's son <span id="fr_61"></span>[4](#fn_61), how, then, does this
correspond as regards the *ri*le and sâman?' The sâman, doubtless, is
the husband of the

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Rik*; and hence
were he also in their case to speak as of a father's son, it would be as
if he spoke of him who is the husband, as of the son: therefore it
corresponds as regards the *rik* and sâman. 'And why does he thrice
carry on (the generation from father to son)?'--father, son, and
grandson: it is these he thereby carries on; and therefore one and the
same (man) offers (food) to them <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:3:6">8:1:3:6</span></span>6. Those
(bricks) which he lays down in front are the holders of the upward air
(the breath, prâ*n*a); those behind are the eye-holders, the holders of
the downward air (apâna) <span id="fr_63"></span>[2](#fn_63); those on
the right side are the mind-holders, the holders of the circulating air
(vyâna); those on the left side are the ear-holders, the holders of the
outward air (udâna); and those in the middle are the speech-holders, the
holders of the pervading air (samâna).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:3:7">8:1:3:7</span></span>7. Now
the *K*arakâdhvaryus, indeed, lay down different (bricks) as holders of
the downward air, of the circulating air, of the outward air, of the
pervading air, as eye-holders, mind-holders, ear-holders, and
speech-holders; but let him not do this, for they do what is excessive,
and in this (our) way, indeed, all those forms are laid (into Agni).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:3:8">8:1:3:8</span></span>8. Now,
when he has laid down (the bricks) in

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

front, he lays down those at the back (of the altar); for the upward
air, becoming the downward air, passes along thus from the tips of the
fingers; and the downward air, becoming the upward air, passes along
thus from the tips of the toes: hence when, after laying down (the
bricks) in front, he lays down those at the back, he thereby makes these
two breathings continuous and connects them; whence these two breathings
are continuous and connected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:3:9">8:1:3:9</span></span>9. And
when he has laid down those on the right side, he lays down those on the
left side; for the outward air, becoming the circulating air, passes
along thus from the tips of the fingers <span
id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64); and the circulating air, becoming the
outward air, passes along thus from the tips of the fingers <span
id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_64): hence when, after laying down (the
bricks) on the right side, he lays down those on the left side, he
thereby makes these two breathings continuous and connects them; whence
these two breathings are continuous and connected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:3:10">8:1:3:10</span></span>10. And
those (bricks) which he lays down in the centre are the vital air; he
lays them down on the range of the two Reta*h*si*k* (bricks), for the
reta*h*si*k* are the ribs, and the ribs are the middle: he thus lays the
vital air into him (Agni and the Sacrificer) in the very middle (of the
body). On every side he lays down (the central bricks) <span
id="fr_66"></span>[2](#fn_65): in every part he thus

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

lays vital air into him; and in the same way indeed that intestinal
breath (channel) is turned all round

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

the navel. He lays them down both lengthwise and crosswise <span
id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_66), whence there are here in the body
(channels of) the vital airs both lengthwise and crosswise. He lays them
down touching each other: he thereby makes these vital airs continuous
and connects them; whence these (channels of the) vital airs are
continuous and connected.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_55"></span>[13:1](sbe4305.htm#fr_55) Or, come to be (Agni-)
Pra*g*âpati's (prâ*g*âpatyâ bhavanti).

<span id="fn_56"></span>[13:2](sbe4305.htm#fr_56) In laying down the
different sets of Prâ*n*abh*ri*t-bricks the priest is said (in [VIII, 1,
1, 5](sbe4303.htm#8:1:1:5); 8; 2, 2; 5; 8) symbolically to put into the
sacrificial work (or into the altar, Agni) 'both verses or metres (as
Gâyatrî, Trish*t*ubh, &c.) and hymn-tunes (as Gâyatra. Svâra, &c.).

<span id="fn_57"></span>[13:3](sbe4305.htm#fr_57) It is not quite clear
whether this is the correct construction of <span id="page_14 ">p.
14</span> the text, especially as, in the paragraph referred to in. the
last note, it is not only the metres and tunes that are supposed to be
put in along with the Prâ*n*abh*ri*ta*h*, but also the stomas and
p*ri*sh*th*a-sâmans.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[14:1](sbe4305.htm#fr_58) Only soma-cups (graha)
and hymn-tunes (sâman) and hymn-forms (stoma) are specially named in
connection with these bricks, but no *s*astras.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[14:2](sbe4305.htm#fr_59) Every stotra, chanted
by the Udgât*ri*s, is followed by a *s*astra recited by the Hot*ri* or
one of his assistants.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[14:3](sbe4305.htm#fr_60) Most chants (stotra)
consisting of a single triplet (e. g. the P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras at the
midday service) have their text (stotriyat*rik*a) included in the
corresponding *s*astra recited by the Hot*ri*, or one of the Hotrakas;
it being followed, on its part, by the recitation of an analogous
triplet (anurûpa, 'similar or corresponding,' i.e. antistrophe) usually
commencing with the very same word, or words, as the stotriya.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[14:4](sbe4305.htm#fr_61) As in the case of the
first (south-west) set of bricks, [VIII, 1, 1,
4](sbe4303.htm#8:1:1:4)-[6](sbe4303.htm#8:1:1:6), he puts down the first
four with 'This one, in front, the existent,' 'His, the existent's son,
the breath,' 'Spring, the son of the breath,' and 'The Gâyatrî, the
daughter of spring,'--implying three generations from father to son (or
daughter). In the formulas of the remaining bricks of each set referring
to the metres (or verses, ilk) and hymn-tunes (sâman) the statement of
descent is expressed more vaguely by, 'From the Gâyatrî (is derived) the
Gâyatra,' &c.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[15:1](sbe4305.htm#fr_62) At the offerings to
the Fathers, or deceased ancestors, oblations are made to the father,
grandfather, and great-grandfather; see II, 4, 2, 23.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[15:2](sbe4305.htm#fr_63) Sâya*n*a, on Taitt. S.
IV, 3, 3, explains 'prâ*n*a' by 'bahi*h*sa*mk*ârarûpa,' and 'apâna' by
'punaranta*h*sa*m*kârarûpa;' see also part i, p. 120, note 2; but cp.
Maitry-up. II, 6; H. Walter, Ha*th*ayogapradipikâ, p. xviii. Beside the
fifty bricks called 'Prâ*n*abh*ri*ta*h*,' the Taittirîyas also place
fifty Apânabh*ri*ta*h* in the first layer of the altar.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[16:1](sbe4305.htm#fr_65) ? Or, perhaps, the
fingers and toes. The same word (aṅguli), having both meanings, makes it
difficult exactly to understand these processes. The available MSS. of
Harisvâmin's commentary unfortunately afford no help.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[16:2](sbe4305.htm#fr_66) That is to say, he
lays down the fifth set round the (central) Svayamât*rinn*â, on the
range of the two Reta*h*si*k* bricks. It is, <span id="page_17">p.
17</span> however, not quite clear in what particular manner this fifth
set of ten bricks is to be arranged round the centre so as to touch one
another. The two Reta*h*si*k* bricks, occupying each a space of a square
foot north and south of the spine, are separated from the central
(Svayamât*rinn*â) brick by the Dviya*g*us brick a foot square. The inner
side of the reta*h*si*k*-space would thus be a foot and a half, and
their outer side two feet and a half, distant from the central point of
the altar. The reta*h*si*k* range, properly speaking, would thus consist
of a circular rim, obtained by drawing two

<span id="img_01700"></span> ![THE CENTRAL PART OF THE FIRST
LAYER.](img/01700.jpg)  
THE CENTRAL PART OF THE FIRST LAYER.

concentric circles round the centre, with diameters of one and a half
and two and a half feet respectively. On this rim (allowing for the
corners of the bricks jutting out) room would have to be found for
twelve bricks of a foot square, viz. the two reta*h*si*k*, already lying
on the eastern side, south and north of the spine, and ten
prâ*n*abh*ri*ts. The way in which these latter were arranged would
probably be this: on each of the three other sides two bricks were laid
down so as to join each other in a line with the respective 'spine,'
similarly to the two reta*h*si*k* bricks on the east side; and the four
remaining bricks would then be placed in the four corners--the twelve
bricks thus forming, as nearly as could be, a circular rim. In the
construction of the altar, this reta*h*si*k* range is determined by a
cord being stretched from. the centre to the east end of the altar,
after the special bricks of the first layer have <span id="page_18">p.
18</span> been laid down, knots being then made in the cord over the
middle of each of the special bricks. The reta*h*si*k* range is
consequently ascertained, in subsequent layers, by a circle drawn round
the centre, with that part of the cord marked by the central and the
reta*h*si*k* knot for the diameter. The foregoing diagram shows that
portion of the first layer which contains the continuous row of special
bricks laid down first, viz. Svayamât*rinn*â, Dviya*g*us, two
Reta*h*si*k*, Vi*s*va*g*yotis, two Ritavyâ, and Ashâ*dh*â; and further
the central (or fifth) set of ten prâ*n*abh*ri*ta*h*, placed round the
central brick on the range of the reta*h*si*k*.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[18:1](sbe4305.htm#fr_67) Each special brick is
marked on its upper surface with (usually three) parallel lines. Now the
bricks are always laid down in such a way that their lines run parallel
to the adjoining spine, whence those on the east and west sides have
their lines running lengthwise (west to east), and those on the north
and south sides crosswise (north to south). As to the four corner bricks
there is some uncertainty on this point, but if we may judge from the
analogy of the second layer in this respect, the bricks of the
south-east and north-west corners would be eastward-lined, and those of
the northeast and south-west corners northward-lined.
