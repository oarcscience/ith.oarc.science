### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### PREPARATORY RITES OF THE SOMA-SACRIFICE.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:1">9:4:3:1</span></span>1. Having
now returned (to the hall), he, at the proper time, throws up the
Dhish*n*yas <span id="fr_413"></span>[1](#fn_406) (fire-hearths.md)--these
hearths are fires: he thus builds up fire-altars. They are the clansmen,
and the built-up fire-altar is the chieftaincy: he thus sets up both the
chieftaincy and the clan. The former (altar) he builds up first, then
these (hearths): thus he sets up the clan after setting up the
chieftaincy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:2">9:4:3:2</span></span>2. That
(fire-altar) is a single one: he thus makes the chieftaincy to attach to
a single (person), and (social) distinction to attach to a single
(person). The others are numerous: he thus bestows multiplicity on the
clan.

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:3">9:4:3:3</span></span>3. That
(fire-altar) consists of five layers, the others of a single layer: he
thus endows the chieftain (or, ruler) pre-eminently with power, and
makes the chieftain more powerful than the clan (or people). Upwards he
builds that one: he thus builds the ruling power upward by (social)
layers; sideways the others: he thus makes the clan obedient to the
chieftain from below.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:4">9:4:3:4</span></span>4. That
one he builds up both with the Ya*g*ushmatî (bricks laid down with a
special formula), and with the Lokamp*rin*â (or space-filling ones, laid
down with a common formula); the others with the space-filling one
alone: he thus endows the chieftain pre-eminently with power, and makes
the chieftain more powerful than the clan, and the clan less powerful
than the chieftain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:5">9:4:3:5</span></span>5. And
when he builds up these (hearths) only with the space-filling one, the
Lokamp*rin*â being the nobility <span
id="fr_414"></span>[1](#fn_407.md)--he thereby places the chieftain, as the
eater, among the clan. He builds up (dhish*n*ya-hearths) both of the
Soma-sacrifice <span id="fr_415"></span>[2](#fn_408.md), and of the
fire-altar; first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and then those of the
fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained. Whatever
Soma-hearth he (merely) throws up (at the Soma-sacrifice), that he (now)
builds up. The Âgnîdhrîya he builds first, for that

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

one he throws up first (at the Soma-sacrifice); (he does so) whilst
sitting to the right (south) of it: the significance of this has been
explained <span id="fr_416"></span>[1](#fn_409.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:6">9:4:3:6</span></span>6. On
this (Âgnîdhrîya) he puts eight bricks,--the Gâyatrî consists of eight
syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great
as is his measure, so great he thus builds him up. The variegated
stone <span id="fr_417"></span>[2](#fn_410.md) is the ninth of them: there
are nine vital airs--seven in the head and two downward ones--it is
these he thus puts into it. The fire which is placed on the erected
(hearth) is the tenth;--there are ten vital airs <span
id="fr_418"></span>[3](#fn_411.md), and the Âgnîdhra is the middle (between
the Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya fires).: he thus puts the vital airs in the
middle of it; for the vital airs, being in the middle of the body, move
along it in this direction, and in that direction.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:7">9:4:3:7</span></span>7.
Twenty-one he places on the Hotrîya (hearth), and there are twenty-one
enclosing-stones <span id="fr_419"></span>[4](#fn_412.md): the significance
of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:8">9:4:3:8</span></span>8. Six
(he places) on the Mâr*g*âlîya,--these are the six seasons, the Fathers;
for the seasons, the

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fathers <span
id="fr_420"></span>[1](#fn_413), indeed, heaped up (a rampart.md) round
that (fire) from the south. This one lies to the south of those (other
hearths) <span id="fr_421"></span>[2](#fn_414),--this (Âgnîdhrîya.md) he
lays down in this way (direction), and these (other hearths) in this
way, and that one (the Fire-altar) in this way: he thereby makes the
peasantry look towards the chieftain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:9">9:4:3:9</span></span>9. He
then encloses these (hearths) by enclosing-stones;--the enclosing-stones
are the waters: it is thus by water that he surrounds them <span
id="fr_422"></span>[3](#fn_415.md). He merely lays them down all round, for
those of the waters which flow in a hollow (channel) are the chieftain,
and these stray waters are the clansmen; thus, when he encloses that
(great fire-altar) by a dug-in (row of stones), he thereby adds power to
power, and sure rounds (protects) power by power; and when he merely
lays down those (enclosing-stones of the hearths) all round, he thereby
adds clansman (or clan) to clansman, and surrounds (protects) clansman
by clansman <span id="fr_423"></span>[4](#fn_416.md). As many bricks with
special formulas as

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

there are (in each hearth) so many enclosing-stones there are (in each);
for with that (fire-altar) there are as many enclosing-stones as there
are such bricks in it <span id="fr_424"></span>[1](#fn_417.md): he thus
makes the clan obedient and subservient to the chief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:10">9:4:3:10</span></span>10. He
then scatters a layer of earth on (each of) these (hearths): the
significance of this has been explained <span
id="fr_425"></span>[2](#fn_418.md). Silently <span
id="fr_426"></span>[3](#fn_419) (he scatters it.md), for indistinct is the
clan (or people). Then, after the cake-offering of the Agnîshomîya
(animal sacrifice) <span id="fr_427"></span>[4](#fn_420.md), he prepares
the propitiatory oblations to the Regions;--that fire-altar is the
regions: it is to them he offers these oblations, and thus by offering
makes them a deity, for only that one is a deity to whom an oblation is
offered, but not that to whom if is. not offered. There are five (such
oblations), for there are five regions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:11">9:4:3:11</span></span>11. As
to this they say,--Let him prepare this

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

offering (ish*t*i) so as to consist of material for ten oblations;--this
(offering) is (performed) with all the stomas and all the p*ri*sh*th*a
(sâmans) <span id="fr_428"></span>[1](#fn_421.md); and there are (used in
it) all the metres, all the regions, all the seasons--and this Agni (the
fire-altar) is all this: he thus, by the (amount of) offering material
(taken out for the ish*t*i), makes (Agni) the deity <span
id="fr_429"></span>[2](#fn_422.md); for only that one is the deity for whom
the oblation is prepared, not one for whom it is not prepared. There are
(in that case) ten (oblations),--the Virâ*g* (metre) consists of ten
syllables, and Agni is virâ*g* (far-shining, or far-ruling); there are
ten regions, and Agni (the fire-altar) is the regions; ten vital airs,
and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his
measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:12">9:4:3:12</span></span>12.
But, indeed, he may also take out these oblations for the Divine
Quickeners <span id="fr_430"></span>[3](#fn_423.md); for these are the
deities which become consecrated by this consecration ceremony by which
he is now to be consecrated: it is them he thus gratifies, and gratified
by offering they permit him (to perform) this consecration ceremony, and
with their permission he is

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

consecrated; for only he becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to
assume) the royal dignity, but not he whom they do not (allow to assume
it). And inasmuch as these deities are consecrated (quickened) by this
consecration ceremony and quicken him for this consecration, they are
(called) the Divine Quickeners.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:13">9:4:3:13</span></span>13.
These (deities) come to have two. names, as he who is consecrated by the
rite of consecration comes to have two names; for the very rite of
consecration for which he is quickened, and by which he is consecrated
(quickened), is his second name <span id="fr_431"></span>[1](#fn_424.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:14">9:4:3:14</span></span>14.
There are eight (such deities),--the Gâyatrî consists of eight
syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great
as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:15">9:4:3:15</span></span>15. As
to this they say,--He ought not to offer (any of) these oblations, lest
he should do what is excessive. Let him nevertheless offer them; for
these oblations are offered for (the obtainment of special) wishes, and
in wishes there is nothing excessive. And whatsoever oblation he offers
after the Pa*s*upuro*d*â*s*a (the cake-offering connected with the
animal sacrifice), that is placed inside the animal victim itself as its
sacrificial sap <span id="fr_432"></span>[2](#fn_425.md). He offers both
kinds (of oblations), those of the Soma-sacrifice and those of the
fire-altar (or Agni*k*ayana), first those of the

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Soma-sacrifice,
and afterwards those of the fire-altar the purport of this has been
explained. In a loud voice <span id="fr_433"></span>[1](#fn_426.md) the
Pa*s*upuro*d*â*s*a offering (is performed), in a low voice these
(additional oblations), for they are an ish*t*i <span
id="fr_434"></span>[2](#fn_427.md). With the Pa*s*upuro*d*â*s*a he (the
Adhvaryu) says, 'Recite!--Urge!' and with these (oblations),
'Recite!--Worship <span id="fr_435"></span>[3](#fn_428.md)' for they are an
ish*t*i. There is the same Svish*t*ak*ri*t and the same i*d*â <span
id="fr_436"></span>[4](#fn_429) (for these oblations). The (Devasû.md)
deities have received offering, and the Svish*t*ak*ri*t (of the
Pa*s*upuro*d*â*s*a) has not yet been attended to <span
id="fr_437"></span>[5](#fn_430.md),--

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:3:16">9:4:3:16</span></span>16. He
then touches it (the fire-altar) with (the formula of) the preliminary
consecration (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 39. 40), 'May Savit*ri* quicken thee for
(powers of) quickening <span id="fr_438"></span>[1](sbe4342.htm#fn_431.md)!
. . . This (man), O ye (people), is your king; Soma is the king of us
Brâhma*n*as!'--he thereby excludes the Brâhma*n*as (from the power of
the king) and makes them such as are not to be fed upon (by the king).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_406"></span>[241:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_413.md) A Soma-sacrifice
being about to be performed on the newly erected fire-altar, now
properly consecrated, all the necessary preparatory business and
ceremonial enjoined for such a sacrifice have now to be gone through in
the way detailed in part ii of this translation. The author here only
alludes to those points in the Soma-ritual in regard to which the
present performance offers any special feature either additional to, or
modificatory of, the ordinary ceremonial. The construction of the
Dhish*n*yas, or fire-hearths of the different priests (for which see
part ii, p. 148, note 4), is one of these points.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[242:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_414.md) See [p.
132](sbe4327.htm#page_132), note [2](sbe4327.htm#fn_235.md).

<span id="fn_408"></span>[242:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_415.md) There are eight
dhish*n*ya-hearths at the Soma-sacrifice, two of which, the Âgnîdhrîya
and Mâr*g*âlîya, were raised north and south of the cart-shed
(havirdhâna), whilst the others (viz. those of the Hot*ri*, &c.) were
raised inside the Sadas along its eastern side. They were merely mounds
of earth covered with sand, whilst the additional hearths (of the
fire-altar) now to be erected are partly built of bricks.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[243:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_416.md) See VII, 1, 1, 21
seq., where the way in which the bricks of the Gârhapatya hearth are
laid down is described in detail.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[243:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_417.md) When Agni was led
forwards from the Gârhapatya to be installed on his newly built altar,
as the Âhavanîya or offering fire, a variegated stone, meant to
represent the sun, was deposited near the place (on the northern edge of
the Vedi) where the Âgnîdhra shed and hearth would afterwards have to be
erected; see [IX, 2, 3,
14](sbe4334.htm#9:2:3:14)-[19](sbe4334.htm#9:2:3:19.md).

<span id="fn_411"></span>[243:3](sbe4341.htm#fr_418.md) That is, including
the central one, the outlet of which is the navel; cf. [VIII, 1, 3,
10](sbe4305.htm#8:1:3:10.md).

<span id="fn_412"></span>[243:4](sbe4341.htm#fr_419.md) The numbers of
bricks and enclosing-stones are the same as for the Gârhapatya hearth,
for which (with their symbolic meaning) see VII, I, I, 32-35.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[244:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_420.md) Sâya*n*a refers to
a passage in the Taittirîyaka, according to which a dying man is changed
to whatever season he dies in, whence the six seasons are the
representatives of all the deceased ancestors. Since the Fathers reside
in the southern region it is from that quarter that, by laying down the
bricks, they are supposed to raise a rampart for the Mâr*g*âlîya fire.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[244:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_421.md) Viz. on the
southern edge of the Vedi, exactly south of the Âgnîdhrîya, whilst the
other dhish*n*yas run in a line from north to south to the left of the
space between the Âgnîdhrîya and Mâr*g*âlîya. The other hearths,
together with the great fire-altar occupying the eastern part of the
Vedi, would thus, as it were, face the Mâr*g*âlîya in a semicircle. See
the plan of the Sacrificial ground, part ii, p. 475.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[244:3](sbe4341.htm#fr_422.md) That is, as the
earth is surrounded by the ocean (VII, 1, 1, 13), or a stronghold by a
moat.

<span id="fn_416"></span>[244:4](sbe4341.htm#fr_423.md) Viz. inasmuch as
the fire-altar and the Âhavanîya fire on it, as <span id="page_245">p.
245</span> well as the dug-in circle of enclosing-stones, are identified
with the ruling power; whilst the dhish*n*yas as well as the circles of
stones lying loosely around them represent the clan.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[245:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_424.md) This is not clear
to me: whilst there are 395 such bricks with special formulas in the
five layers of the great altar, it is enclosed by only 261 pari*s*rits;
see [p. 158](sbe4330.htm#page_158), note [1](sbe4330.htm#fn_264.md).
Besides there are no 'ya*g*ushmatî' bricks in these hearths, but only
'lokamp*rin*âs'; one would therefore expect 'ish*t*akâs' (bricks) for
'ya*g*ushmatyas' the first time (cf. comm. on Kâty. *S*r. XVIII, 7, 13).
The Hot*ri*'s hearth contains twenty-one bricks, the
Brâhma*n*â*kkh*a*m*sin's eleven, the Mâr*g*âlîya six, and the others
eight bricks; and in each case the common formula, 'Lokam p*rin*a, &c,'
(see [VIII, 7, 2, 6](sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:6).md), is pronounced once after
every ten bricks, and after any odd bricks remaining over at the end.
Cf. Kâty. *S*r. XVIII, 6, 8 seq.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[245:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_425.md) See [VIII, 7, 3,
1](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:1.md) seq.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[245:3](sbe4341.htm#fr_426.md) He does not use any
such formula as that used in covering each layer of the great altar with
earth; see [VIII, 7, 3, 7](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:7.md).

<span id="fn_420"></span>[245:4](sbe4341.htm#fr_427.md) See part ii, p.
199, note 2 (where the reference at the end should be to IV, 2, 5, 22).

<span id="fn_421"></span>[246:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_428.md) See part iii,
introduction, p. xx seq.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[246:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_429.md) As Sâya*n*a points
out, the Taittirîyas make Agni the deity of this ish*t*i, the invitatory
formulas (puro<sup>ऽ</sup>nuvâkyâ) of the different havis (oblations)
naming him each time with different epithets relating to different
metres, stomas, p*ri*sh*th*as, and seasons. Cf. Taitt. S. I, 8, 4:
Taitt. Br. I, 8, 19.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[246:3](sbe4341.htm#fr_430.md) For these eight
deities (Savit*ri* Satyaprasava, Agni G*ri*hapati, &c.), to whom
offering is made at the Abhishe*k*anîya or Consecration ceremony of the
Râ*g*asûya, between the chief oblation of the animal cake-offering
(Pa*s*upuro*d*â*s*a) and its Svish*t*ak*ri*t, whilst the whole of the
Pa*s*upuro*d*â*s*a is again performed in the middle of the animal
sacrifice, see part iii, p. 69 seq.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[247:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_431.md) That is to say, for
example, he who has performed the Vâ*g*apeya is called
Vâ*g*apeya-yâ*g*in, Sây.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[247:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_432.md) These oblations, as
well as those of the Pa*s*upuro*d*â*s*a, inserted as they are in the
middle of the animal offering,--just after the offering of the omentum
of the victim,--are supposed to supply to the victim its sacrificial sap
or essence which was taken out of it in the shape of the omentum. See
III, 8, 3, 2.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[248:1](sbe4341.htm#fr_433.md) That is, in the
formulas the name of the deity to whom the oblation is offered is
pronounced in a loud voice.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[248:2](sbe4341.htm#fr_434.md) That is, a
'kâmyesh*t*i,' or offering for the obtainment of some special object,
which has to be performed in a low voice; see I, 3, 5, 10.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[248:3](sbe4341.htm#fr_435.md) Or, 'Pronounce the
offering-prayer!' For these two latter calls (anubrûhi!--ya*g*a!), by
which the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot*ri* to pronounce the invitatory
prayer (anuvâkyâ or puro<sup>ऽ</sup>nuvâkyâ) and the offering-prayer
(yâ*g*yâ) respectively, at ish*t*is, see I, 5, 2, 8-10 and I, 5, 3, 8;
and for the first two (anubrûhi!--preshya!), by the former of which the
Adhvaryu calls on the Hot*ri* to recite the invitatory prayer; whilst by
the latter he calls on the Maitrâvaru*n*a to 'urge' (or prompt') the
Hot*ri* to pronounce the offering-prayer at the animal sacrifice, see
III, 8, 1, 4 with note (where attention might have been called to the
difference that exists between the ish*t*i and the animal sacrifice in
regard to the formula by which the Adhvaryu calls for the recitation of
the offering-prayer). In regard to this point there is, however, a
difference of opinion between the Mâdhyandina and the Kâ*n*va schools,
the latter using for the Pa*s*upuro*d*â*s*a on this occasion, as well as
on that of the Râ*g*asûya, the same calls as those of the inserted
ish*t*is; cf. Kâty. *S*r. XV, 4, 18-20.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[248:4](sbe4341.htm#fr_436.md) For the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t, or oblation to Agni, 'the maker of good offering,'
offered after the chief oblations, see I, 7, 3, 1 seq.; for the
i*d*â-oblation (and invocation of I*d*â), I, 8, 1, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[248:5](sbe4341.htm#fr_437.md) The tentative
meaning assigned to 'asamavahitam,' 'not in immediate connection with
(the Svish*t*ak*ri*t),' can scarcely be right. The clause seems simply
to mean that the (pûrvâbhisheka) touching <span id="page_249">p.
249</span> of the altar is to take place, as in the case of the
(preliminary) consecration at the Râ*g*asûya, immediately after the
oblations to the Divine Quickeners, and before the Svish*t*ak*ri*t
oblation of the Pa*s*upuro*d*â*s*a has been performed. See V, 3, 3, 50,
where a somewhat similar expression is used. One might have some doubt
as to whether, both here and at the Râ*g*asûya, there is any
Svish*t*ak*ri*t at all to these Devasû-havî*m*shi, or whether the
statement, 'There is the same svish*t*ak*ri*t and the same i*d*â,'
applies not to them merely, but to them and the Pa*s*upuro*d*â*s*a. If
this latter alternative were the correct one, we should, however, expect
that something had been said on this point in connection with the Devasû
oblations of the Râ*g*asûya; and moreover the nature of the two
oblations seems too different for such a partial identification,
requiring as they do different 'praishas,' or calls, in the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t (viz. 'ya*g*a' the one, and 'preshya' the other); see
also [IX, 5, 1, 40](sbe4343.htm#9:5:1:40), and note [3](#fn_428.md), [p.
248](#page_248.md); also Kâty. *S*r. V, II, 23-24.
