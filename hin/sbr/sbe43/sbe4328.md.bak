### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:1">8:7:3:1</span></span>1. He now
throws loose soil (on the layer); for the loose soil means flesh: he
thus covers him (Agni) with flesh. \[He does so\] after having laid down
the bricks;--the bricks are the bone: he thus covers the bone with
flesh.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:2">8:7:3:2</span></span>2. He
also strews it on (the place where lies) the naturally-perforated
(brick), for the naturally-perforated one means vital air, and the loose
soil

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

means food: he thus puts food into (the channels of) the vital air. In
that manner <span id="fr_247"></span>[1](#fn_246.md) he covers the whole
body (of the altar); whence the food which is put into (the channels of)
the vital air benefits the whole body, extends over the whole body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:3">8:7:3:3</span></span>3. 'Let
him not strew it on (the place of) the naturally-perforated one,' say
some, 'lest he should stop up (the channels of) the vital airs, for the
naturally-perforated one is the vital air.' Let him, nevertheless, strew
it, for the vital airs are sustained by food, and whoever eats no food
his (channels of the) vital airs grow up (and close): hence he for whom
they act thus, comes to exist in yonder world even like a dry, hollow
tube. Let him, therefore, by all means strew (loose soil) on (the place
of) the naturally-perforated one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:4">8:7:3:4</span></span>4. Having
strewed it on the svayamât*rinn*â (place) he goes on covering (the
altar) from the (brick) on the cross-spine up to the enclosing-stones.
In the same way he goes on covering it from left to right behind the
naturally-perforated one up to the one on the cross-spine again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:5">8:7:3:5</span></span>5. The
body (of the altar) he covers first, for of (a bird) that is produced,
the body is the first to be produced; then the right wing, then the
tail, then the left wing: that is in the rightward (sunwise) way, for
this is (the way) with the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:6">8:7:3:6</span></span>6. Now
this loose soil, indeed, is the vital air; he therewith covers the whole
body: he thus puts vital air into the whole body. And, assuredly,
whatsoever member thereof he should not reach, that member of him (Agni)
the vital air would not

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

reach; and whatever member the vital air does not reach that either
dries up or withers away: let him, therefore, cover it entirely
therewith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:7">8:7:3:7</span></span>7. \[He
scatters the loose soil <span id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_247.md), with,
Vâ*g*. S. XV, 56; *Ri*g-veda I, 11, 1\], 'They all have magnified
Indra,'--for all beings, indeed, magnify Indra;--'the voices, him, of
ocean-wide extent,'--he thereby alludes to his greatness;--'the foremost
of charioteers,'--for of charioteers he is the greatest
charioteer;--'the lordly lord of viands,'--viands mean food: thus, 'the
lordly lord of food.' With this anush*t*ubh verse addressed to Indra he
scatters it; for the loose soil belongs to Indra: that (layer of) loose
soil is one half of Agni (the fire-altar), the (other) half is the
collection of bricks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:8">8:7:3:8</span></span>8. Here,
now, they say, 'Whilst he lays down the bricks with all kinds of metres,
and with (verses addressed to) all deities, he now scatters (the soil)
with a single (verse) addressed to a single deity,--how is this one half
of Agni?' Indra, surely, is equal to all the gods; hence in that he
scatters it with a (verse) addressed to Indra, this (soil) is one half
of Agni. And as to its being (done) with an anush*t*ubh verse,--the
Anush*t*ubh is speech, and all metres are speech: thereby also it is one
half.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:9">8:7:3:9</span></span>9. He
then lays down the Vikar*n*î and Svayamât*rinn*â (bricks),--the
Vikar*n*î is Vâyu (the wind), and the last naturally-perforated one is
the sky: he thus sets up both the wind and the sky. He lays them down as
the last (highest), for wind and sky are the highest; and close
together, for wind and

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

sky are close together. The Vikar*n*î he lays down first: he thereby
places the wind on this side of the sky; whence that wind blows only on
this side (thereof).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:10">8:7:3:10</span></span>10.
And, again, as to why he lays down the Vikar*n*î. When, on that (former)
occasion, they make the horse smell (the pile of bricks of) the (first)
layer <span id="fr_249"></span>[1](#fn_248.md), then yonder sun strings
these worlds to himself on a thread. Now that thread is the same as the
wind; and that wind is the same as this Vikar*n*î: thus when he lays
down the latter, then yonder sun strings to himself these worlds on a
thread.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:11">8:7:3:11</span></span>11.
And, again, as to why he lays down the Vikar*n*î and the
Svayamât*rinn*â; the Vikar*n*î, doubtless, is vital power, and the
naturally-perforated one is vital air: he thus bestows both vital power
and vital air. He lays them down as the two last (highest bricks),
because vital power and vital air are the two highest (endowments); and
close together, because vital power and vital air are closely (bound)
together. The upper (northern) Vikar*n*î he lays down first <span
id="fr_250"></span>[2](#fn_249.md): he thereby encloses the vital air on
both sides in vital power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:12">8:7:3:12</span></span>12.
\[He lays it down, with, Vâ*g*. S. XV, 62; *Ri*g-veda VII, 3, 2\],
'When, like a snorting steed, that longeth for the pasture, he started
forth from the great enclosure, then the wind fanned his flame, and
black then was thy path;'--for when the wind fans his (Agni's) flame,

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

then his path does become black. With a trish*t*ubh verse he lays it
down, because Vâyu (the wind) is of trish*t*ubh nature; with one
relating to Agni, because it is Agni's performance; with an undefined
one, because Vâyu is undefined. And as to his saying 'the wind,' Vâyu
indeed is the wind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:13">8:7:3:13</span></span>13. He
then lays down the Svayamât*rinn*â, with (Vâ*g*. S. XV, 63), 'I seat
thee in the seat of the vital power,'--the vital power, doubtless, is
yonder (sun), and his seat this is;--'the animating,'--for he (the sun)
animates all this universe;--'in the shadow,'--for in his shadow all
this universe is;--'in the heart of the sea,'--for this, indeed, is the
heart of the (aerial) sea <span id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_250.md);--'the
radiant, the luminous,'--for radiant and luminous is the sky;--'thou
that illumines the sky, the earth and the wide air;'--for thus, indeed,
does he (the sun) illumine these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:14">8:7:3:14</span></span>14.
'May Paramesh*th*in settle thee,'--for Paramesh*th*in saw this fifth
layer <span id="fr_252"></span>[2](#fn_251.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:15">8:7:3:15</span></span>15.
And, again, as to why he lays it down by means of Paramesh*th*in. When
Pra*g*âpati had become disjointed, the deities took him and went off in
different directions. Paramesh*th*in took his head, and kept going away
from him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:16">8:7:3:16</span></span>16. He
spake to him, 'Come to me and restore unto me that wherewith thou hast
gone from me!'--'What will therefrom accrue to me?'--'That part of my
body shall be sacred to thee!'--'So be it!' So Paramesh*th*in restored
that to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:17">8:7:3:17</span></span>17. Now
that last self-perforated (brick) is just

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

that part of him (Pra*g*âpati-Agni); and when he now lays it down in
this place, he thereby restores to him what part of his body this is:
that is why he lays it down in this place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:18">8:7:3:18</span></span>18. 'On
the back of the sky, thee, the wide and broad one!'--for this (top of
the altar) is indeed the back of the sky, and it is both wide and
broad <span id="fr_253"></span>[1](#fn_252.md);--'Sustain thou the sky!
make firm the sky! injure not the sky!'--that is, 'Sustain thy self,
make firm thy self, injure not thy self (body)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:19">8:7:3:19</span></span>19.
'For all out-breathing, off-breathing, through-breathing,
up-breathing!'--the naturally-perforated (brick) is the vital air, and
the vital air truly serves for everything here;--'for a resting-place,
for a moving-place!'--the naturally-perforated (bricks) are these
worlds, and these worlds are the resting-place and the
moving-place;--'May Sûrya guard thee,'--that is, 'May Sûrya protect
thee,'--'with mighty well-being,'--that is, 'with great
well-being;'--'with the safest roof!'--that is, 'with whatever roof
(abode) is the safest.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:20">8:7:3:20</span></span>20.
Separately he lays them down, for separate are wind and sky; and once
only he 'settles' them: he thereby makes them the same, for vital power
and vital air are the same. They are both of them stones and both of
them naturally-perforated; for vital power and vital air are the same.
He then pronounces the Sûdadohas over them,--the Sûdadohas means vital
air; he thus makes them

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

continuous, joins them together by means of the vital air.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:3:21">8:7:3:21</span></span>21.
'Those his well-like milking ones <span
id="fr_254"></span>[1](#fn_253)'--a well (sûda.md) means water, and milking
means food;--'the speckled ones mix the Soma,'--the speckled (cow) means
food;--'at the birth of the gods,'--the birth of the gods is the
year;--'the tribes,' the tribes (vi*s*), doubtless, are the sacrifice,
for all beings are ranged (vish*t*a) <span
id="fr_255"></span>[2](#fn_254.md) under the sacrifice;--'in the three
spheres of the heavens,'--the three spheres of the heavens, doubtless,
are the (three) pressings (of Soma): he thus means the pressings. With
an anush*t*ubh verse (he performs this rite), for the Anush*t*ubh is
speech, and speech (includes) all vital airs; and by means of speech,
that is vital air, he thus makes these two (bricks) continuous, and
joins them together. This same Sûdadohas, whilst being a single (verse),
extends over all the bricks, whence--the Sûdadohas being the vital
air--this vital air, whilst being one only, extends over all the limbs,
over the whole body.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_246"></span>[139:1](sbe4328.htm#fr_247.md) Or, therewith (with
loose soil).

<span id="fn_247"></span>[140:1](sbe4328.htm#fr_248.md) Taking it from the
edge of the *K*âtvâla or pit, cf. VII, 1, 1, 36.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[141:1](sbe4328.htm#fr_249.md) See VII, 3, 2, 13.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[141:2](sbe4328.htm#fr_250.md) As 'uttarâm' means
both 'northern' and 'higher,' so 'pûrvâm' means both 'first' and
'eastern,' hence, by a whimsical play on these double meanings, 'on both
(or two) sides.'

<span id="fn_250"></span>[142:1](sbe4328.htm#fr_251.md) The topmost
naturally-perforated brick represents the heavens.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[142:2](sbe4328.htm#fr_252.md) See VI, 2, 3, 5;
10.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[143:1](sbe4328.htm#fr_253.md) Though, in the text
of the formula, the adjectives are feminine, and evidently refer to the
brick, the author here makes them neuter, referring them to
'p*ri*sh*th*am,' the back (of the sky).

<span id="fn_253"></span>[144:1](sbe4328.htm#fr_254.md) Part iii, p. 307,
note 2, the following translation of this difficult and obscure verse
was proposed:--'At his birth the well-like milking, speckled ones mix
the Soma (draught), the clans of the gods in the three spheres of the
heavens.'

<span id="fn_254"></span>[144:2](sbe4328.htm#fr_255.md) Literally, have
entered, or settled. At XIV, 8, 13, 3, the same etymological word-play
occurs, only 'food (anne)' being substituted for 'sacrifice (ya*gñ*e)';
where the St. Petersb. Dict. takes 'vish*t*a' in the sense of 'entered,
i. e. contained.'
