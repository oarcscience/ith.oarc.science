### SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:1:1">10:2:1:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati was desirous of going up to the world of heaven; but
Pra*g*âpati, indeed, is all the (sacrificial) animals <span
id="fr_569"></span>[3](#fn_560.md)--man, horse, bull, ram, and

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

he-goat:--by means of these forms he could not do so. He saw this
bird-like body, the fire-altar, and constructed it. He attempted to fly
up, without contracting and expanding (the wings), but could not do so.
By contracting and expanding (the wings) he did fly up: whence even to
this day birds can only fly up when they contract their wings and spread
their feathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:1:2">10:2:1:2</span></span>2. He
measures it (the fire-altar) by finger-breadths; for the sacrifice being
a man <span id="fr_570"></span>[1](#fn_561.md), it is by means of him that
everything is measured here. Now these, to wit, the fingers, are his
lowest measure: he thus secures for him (the sacrificial man <span
id="fr_571"></span>[2](#fn_562).md) that lowest measure of his, and
therewith he thus measures him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:1:3">10:2:1:3</span></span>3. He
measures by twenty-four finger-breadths <span
id="fr_572"></span>[3](#fn_563),--the [Gâyatrî](errata.htm#4) (verse.md)
consists of twenty-four syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature <span
id="fr_573"></span>[4](#fn_564.md): as great as Agni is, as great as is his
measure, by so much he thus measures him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:1:4">10:2:1:4</span></span>4. He
contracts <span id="fr_574"></span>[5](#fn_565) (the right wing.md) inside
on both

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

sides <span id="fr_575"></span>[1](#fn_566.md) by just four
finger-breadths, and expands <span id="fr_576"></span>[2](#fn_567.md) it
outside on both sides <span id="fr_577"></span>[1](#fn_566.md) by four
finger-breadths: he thus expands it by just as much as he contracts it;
and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds (its proper size) nor does he make
it too small. In the same way in regard to the tail, and in the same way
in regard to the left wing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:1:5">10:2:1:5</span></span>5. He
then makes two bending-limbs <span id="fr_578"></span>[3](#fn_568.md) in
the wings, for there are two bending-limbs in a bird's

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

wings. In one-third (of each wing he makes them), for the bending-limbs
are in one-third of the bird's wings;--in the inner third <span
id="fr_579"></span>[1](#fn_569.md), for the bending-limbs are in the inner
third of a bird's wings. He expands (each of these limbs) in front <span
id="fr_580"></span>[2](#fn_570.md) by just four finger-breadths, and
contracts it behind by four finger-breadths; he thus expands it by just
as much as he contracts it; and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds (its
size), nor does he make it too small.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:1:6">10:2:1:6</span></span>6. On
that bending-limb he places one brick he thereby gives to it that single
tube (tubular organ) which joins on to <span
id="fr_581"></span>[3](#fn_571) (the body.md) from the bending-limb of the
flying bird. Then here (on the left wing).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:1:7">10:2:1:7</span></span>7. He
then makes the wings crooked, for a bird's wings are crooked; he expands
them behind by just four finger-breadths, and contracts them in front by
four finger-breadths <span id="fr_582"></span>[4](#fn_572.md): he thus
draws them out by

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

just as much as he draws them in; and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds
(its size) nor does he make it too small.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:1:8">10:2:1:8</span></span>8. He
now gives to it (the altar) the highest form <span
id="fr_583"></span>[1](#fn_573.md). This Agni had now been completely
restored, and the gods conferred upon him this highest form; and in like
manner does this (Sacrificer) confer upon him this highest form: he
makes a thousand bricks marked with straight lines, a thousand marked
this way (from left to right), and a thousand marked that way (from
right to left).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:1:9">10:2:1:9</span></span>9. And
when he has laid down the fifth layer, he measures out the altar in
three parts, and on the central part he places the one thousand bricks
marked with straight lines: he thereby gives to it those straight plumes
of the bird pointing backwards (with their tops, and covering it) from
head to tail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:1:10">10:2:1:10</span></span>10.
On the right side he then lays down the one thousand (bricks) marked
*thus* (from left to right): he thereby gives to it those curved plumes
on the right side of the bird <span id="fr_584"></span>[2](#fn_574.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:1:11">10:2:1:11</span></span>11.
On the left side he then lays down the one thousand (bricks) marked
*thus* (from right to left): he thereby gives to it those curved plumes
on the left side of the bird. With a thousand (bricks he does it each
time)--a thousand means everything:

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

with everything (required) he thus confers that highest form upon him
(Agni);--with three thousand--Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is, as
great as is his measure, with so much he thus confers the highest form
upon him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_560"></span>[299:3](sbe4350.htm#fr_569.md) See VI, 2, 1, 15
seq.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[300:1](sbe4350.htm#fr_570.md) The sacrifice,
being the substitute of (the sacrificing) man, is represented as
identical with the Sacrificer, its measurements being taken from his
body and stature; see part i, p. 78. note 1.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[300:2](sbe4350.htm#fr_571.md) Or,--for it, viz.
the fire-altar, representing both Agni-Pra*g*âpati and the Sacrificer:
hence this assumed identity has to be borne in mind to understand the
symbolic speculations of the Brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[300:3](sbe4350.htm#fr_572.md) This measure (24
aṅguli) is equal to one 'aratni' or cubit; 12 aṅguli being equal to a
'vitasti' or span (of thumb and little finger, or from wrist to tip of
middle finger).

<span id="fn_564"></span>[300:4](sbe4350.htm#fr_573.md) See VI, 1, 1, 15;
1, 3, 29.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[300:5](sbe4350.htm#fr_574.md) Or, he draws in,
draws together (upasamûhati).

<span id="fn_566"></span>[301:1](sbe4350.htm#fr_577.md) That is, on both
sides of that part of the wing which joins the body of the altar he
draws in by four finger-breadths the two long sides of the wing, thus
changing the parallelogram into a trapezium, without altering the
superficial area of the wing. On the plan of the altar given in part ii,
p. 419, the effect of this manipulation on the wings and tail is
indicated by pointed lines.--Sâya*n*a remarks,--ubhayata*h* pakshasya
pâr*s*vadvaye, antarata*h* *k*ityâgner madhyade*s*e *k*aturaṅgulam
upasamûhati sa*m*karshati prave*s*ayatîty artha*h*; bâhyata*h*
agnimadhyâd bâhyade*s*e *k*aturaṅgula*m* vyudûhati, ante vivardhayati.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[301:2](sbe4350.htm#fr_576.md) Or, he draws out,
or draws asunder (vyudûhati).

<span id="fn_568"></span>[301:3](sbe4350.htm#fr_578.md) Literally
'outbendings' (nir*n*âma)--'Schwunggelenke' (spring-limbs), St. Petersb.
Dict.--This 'bending-limb' would seem to include the two inner segments
of the (solid part of the) wing--those corresponding to the upper and
fore-arm of man--as well as the adjoining and connecting joints or
articulations, which portions may be taken roughly as forming the inner
third of the wing when covered with feathers. The 'bending-limb' would
thus derive its name from its 'bending,' or drawing, the wing 'out' from
the body. Sâya*n*a, however, explains it by 'nitarâ*m* namati,' 'that
which bends down,' as if it were formed from the prep. 'ni,' instead of
'nis.' The manipulation to which this part of the wing is to be
subjected is, however, not quite easy to understand from the
description, and the commentary affords very little
assistance--vit*ri*tîya iti pakshabhâga*m* tredhâ vibha*g*ya antare
t*ri*tîyabhâge nirnâmakara*n*am . .; etâ*m* *s*rutim
apekshyaivâpastambenoktam, ‘vakrapaksho vyastapu*kkh*o bhavati, pa*sk*ât
prâṅ (!) udûhati, purastât pratyudûhati, evam eva hi vayasâm madhye
pakshanir*n*âmo bhavatîti vi*gñ*âyate’ iti.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[302:1](sbe4350.htm#fr_579.md) That is, the third
part of the wing adjoining the body.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[302:2](sbe4350.htm#fr_580.md) That is, at the
front edge of the wing of the flying bird, that which cuts through the
air. The joint between the second and third segments of the wing, when
expanded, would protrude, whilst on the opposite side of the wing the
tops of the feathers would somewhat recede; but I am not sure whether
this is what is referred to in these indications.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[302:3](sbe4350.htm#fr_581.md) Literally, which
lies beside, or close to (upa*s*ete, viz. the body, as it would seem)
from the bending-limb. The brick is apparently meant to represent
symbolically the bone of the upper segment, or some tubular organ by
which the vital air is supposed to enter the wing from the body.
Sâya*n*a remarks,--pakshipakshamadhyagatanâ*d*îtvena pra*s*a*m*sati, . .
*k*ityâgne*h* pakshamadhye ekâ*m* nâ*d*îm eva nihitavân bhavati.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[302:4](sbe4350.htm#fr_582.md)
Comm.--*k*aturaṅgulamâtra*m* pa*sk*âdbhâge udûhati vikarshati,
purastâdbhâge *k*aturaṅgulamâtra*m* samûhati sa*m*karshati; eva*m*
k*ri*te vakratva*m* bhavati. Cf. Âpastamba's directions in note
[3](#fn_571.md) of last page. I fail to see, however, in what respect this
manipulation differs from that referred to in paragraph 5; and whether
the <span id="page_303">p. 303</span> 'vakratvam' refers to the
irregular shape, or to the curved nature, of the wings.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[303:1](sbe4350.htm#fr_583.md) That is, he gives
to it the last finish.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[303:2](sbe4350.htm#fr_584.md) Or, perhaps, those
soft feathers of the bird curved towards the right. Sâya*n*a as
above--dakshi*n*ata*h* dakshi*n*apakshe ityâlikhitâ dakshi*n*âv*ri*ta
ish*t*akâ*h*; uttarata*h* uttarasmin pakshe ityâlikhitâ*h* savyâv*ri*ta
ish*t*akâ upadadhyât.
