### SEVENTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:1">8:7:1:1</span></span>1. He
lays down two Ritavyâ (seasonal bricks). The seasonal (bricks) are the
same as these seasons: it is the seasons he thereby lays down. And,
indeed, the seasonal ones are everything here, for the seasonal ones are
the year, and the year is everything here: he thus lays down everything
here. And generative power they also are,--for the seasonal ones are the
year, and the year means generative power: it is generative power he
thus lays down (or bestows on Agni and the Sacrificer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:2">8:7:1:2</span></span>2. And,
again, as to why he lays down seasonal (bricks),--the seasonal (ones)
are the nobility and these other bricks are the peasantry: he thus
places the nobility as the eater among the peasantry. He lays down (some
of) them in all the layers: he thus places the nobility as the eater
among the whole people <span id="fr_227"></span>[3](#fn_226.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:3">8:7:1:3</span></span>3. And,
again, as to why he lays down seasonal (bricks),--this fire-altar is the
year, and it is joined together by means of the seasonal (bricks): he
thus makes the year continuous, and joins it together, by means of the
seasons. These (formulas of the seasonal bricks) begin in a different
way, but end in the same way; for the seasons were created, and, when
created, they were different.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:4">8:7:1:4</span></span>4. They
spake, 'While being thus, we shall not be

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

able to procreate: let us unite with our forms!' They united in each
single season with their forms, whence there is in each single season
the form of all the seasons. As to their (formulas) beginning in a
different way, it is because they were created different (or
separately); and as to their ending in the same way, it is because they
united with their forms.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:5">8:7:1:5</span></span>5. He
lays them down, with (Vâ*g*. S. XV, 57), 'Tapa and Tapasya, the two dewy
seasons,'--these are the names of these two: it is thus by their names
that he lays them down. Tapa (the burner), doubtless, is yonder sun:
from him these two seasons are not separated; and inasmuch as these two
seasons are not separated from him, they are called Tapa and Tapasya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:6">8:7:1:6</span></span>6.
'Agni's coupling-link thou art,'--this fire-altar is the year, and it is
joined together by means of the seasonal (bricks): he thus makes the
year continuous, and joins it together by means of the seasons;--'May
Heaven and earth fit into one another! may the waters and plants fit
into each other!'--he thereby makes everything here <span
id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_227.md) to fit in by means of the seasons:--'May
the fires fit into one another, each singly, working harmoniously
together for my supremacy!'--for these single bricks are the same as
those fires: he thus says this so that they may fit in with each other
for the supremacy of those two seasons:--'whatever fires there are, at
one with each other, within these two, Heaven and Earth;'--as the text
is, so is its meaning;--'let them draw

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

together, fitting in with the two dewy seasons, even as the gods draw
together unto Indra;'--that is, 'even as the gods are drawing together
round Indra, so may they draw together for supremacy round these two
seasons.' Two bricks there are, because the season consists of two
months. Only once he 'settles' them: he thereby makes the season to be
one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:7">8:7:1:7</span></span>7. And as
to why he now lays down these two;--this fire-altar is the year, and the
year is these worlds: the fifth layer of this (altar) is the sky, and
the dewy season of this (year) is the sky; and when he now lays down
these two (bricks), he thereby restores to his (Agni's) body what these
two are thereto: this is why he now lays down these two (bricks).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:8">8:7:1:8</span></span>8. And,
again, as to why he now lays down these two;--this Agni (the fire-altar)
is Pra*g*âpati (the lord of generation), and Pra*g*âpati is the year:
the fifth layer is his (Agni's) head, and the dewy season is its (the
year's) head; and when he now lays down these two (bricks), he thereby
restores to his (or its) body what these two are thereto: this is why he
now lays down these two (bricks).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:9">8:7:1:9</span></span>9. He
lays down the two seasonal ones prior to the naturally-perforated one
and to the Vi*s*va*g*yotis; for the last naturally-perforated one is the
sky <span id="fr_229"></span>[1](#fn_228.md), and the last
Vi*s*va*g*yotis <span id="fr_230"></span>[2](#fn_229) (all-light brick.md)
is

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

the sun: he thus places the seasons on this side of the sky and the sun;
whence the seasons are on this side thereof. But generative power there
also is (in these seasonal bricks) <span
id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_230.md): he thus places generative power on this
side of the sky and the sun; whence procreation takes place only on this
side of them, but stationary, indeed, is procreation beyond them, for
just as many gods as there were of old, so many there are now.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:10">8:7:1:10</span></span>10.
Now, the (first) two seasonal (bricks) he lays down subsequently to the
first naturally-perforated one, and to the first Vi*s*va*g*yotis; for
the first naturally-perforated one is this (earth), and the first
Vi*s*va*g*yotis is Agni: thereupon he places the seasons, whence the
seasons are upwards from this (earth). But generative power there also
is therein: he thus places generative power above this (earth); whence
procreation only takes place above (upon, not under) this (earth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:11">8:7:1:11</span></span>11. Let
him not derange these (seasonal bricks) <span
id="fr_232"></span>[2](#fn_231.md) lest he should derange the seasons, for
deranged are

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

the seasons for him who dies: hence, in whatever place he lays down the
first two, there let him lay down all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:12">8:7:1:12</span></span>12. But
the seasonal (bricks), indeed, are also these (three) worlds: by the
(different) layers he thus builds up these worlds one above the other.
And the seasonal (bricks), indeed, are also the nobility: by the
(different) layers he thus builds up the nobility above (the peasantry).
And the seasonal ones, indeed, are also the year: by the (different)
layers he thus builds up the year. Let him not thereafter place over
them any other brick with a sacrificial formula, lest he should place
the peasantry above the nobility.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:13">8:7:1:13</span></span>13. Now
these same (bricks) are indeed steppingstones, for by means of the
seasonal (bricks) the gods then stepped over these worlds, hath from
hence upwards and from above downwards: and in like manner does the
Sacrificer now, by means of the seasonal (bricks), step over these
worlds, both from hence upwards and from above downwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:14">8:7:1:14</span></span>14.
Now, the *K*arakâdhvaryus lay down here yet other 'stepping-stones'; but
let him not do so, for they do what is redundant, and these are indeed
(all) the stepping-stones.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:15">8:7:1:15</span></span>15. He
then lays down a Vi*s*va*g*yotis (all-light brick);--the last
Vi*s*va*g*yotis, doubtless, is the sun, for in yonder (celestial) world
the sun, indeed, is 'all the light': it is the sun he thereby sets up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:16">8:7:1:16</span></span>16.
And, again, as to why he lays down a Vi*s*va*g*yotis:--the
Vi*s*va*g*yotis, doubtless, means progeny, for progeny indeed is all the
light:--he thus lays generative power into it (or into him, Agni and the
Sacrificer).

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:17">8:7:1:17</span></span>17. He
lays down the Vi*s*va*g*yotis prior to the naturally-perforated
one;--for the last naturally-perforated one is the sky, and the last
Vi*s*va*g*yotis is the sun: he thus places the sun on this side (below)
the sky, whence he burns only on this side thereof. But there also is
generative power therein: he thus places generative power on this side
of the sky, whence procreation takes place only on this side thereof.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:18">8:7:1:18</span></span>18. Now
the (first) Vi*s*va*g*yotis he lays down subsequent to the first
naturally-perforated one; for the first naturally-perforated one is this
(earth), and the first Vi*s*va*g*yotis is Agni: he thus sets up Agni
upwards from this (earth), whence the fire blazes upwards from here. But
there also is generative power therein: he thus places generative power
above this (earth), whence procreation only takes place above this
(earth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:19">8:7:1:19</span></span>19. And
the (second) Vi*s*va*g*yotis he lays down subsequent to the second
naturally-perforated one (in the third, or central) layer; for the
second naturally-perforated one is the air, and the second
Vi*s*va*g*yotis is Vâyu (the wind): he thus places the wind in the air,
whence that wind (has his abode) in the air.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:20">8:7:1:20</span></span>20.
These (three) then are the lights;--and when he lays down these (three
Vi*s*va*g*yotis bricks) in this way, he thereby sets up those same
lights so as to face each other; and hence the fire blazes upwards from
this (earth), and yonder sun shines downwards, and that wind blows
sideways in the air.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:21">8:7:1:21</span></span>21.
\[He 'settles' the Vi*s*va*g*yotis, with, Vâ*g*. S. XV, 58\], 'May
Paramesh*th*in settle thee'--for Paramesh*th*in saw this fifth
layer;--'on the back

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

of the sky, thee, the luminous one!'--for on the back of the sky is
yonder luminous sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:22">8:7:1:22</span></span>22.
'For all out-breathing, and off-breathing, and through-breathing,'--for
the Vi*s*va*g*yotis is the breath, and breath, indeed, is (necessary)
for everything here;--'bestow thou all the light!'--that is, 'bestow
thou the whole (or every) light;'--'Sûrya is thine overlord,'--he
thereby makes Sûrya (the sun) its overlord. Having 'settled' it, he
pronounces the Sûdadohas on it: its (symbolical) meaning has been
told <span id="fr_233"></span>[1](#fn_232.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:23">8:7:1:23</span></span>23.
Now, these (bricks) are indeed stepping-stones, for by means of the
Vi*s*va*g*yotis (bricks) the gods then stepped over these worlds, both
from hence upwards, and from above downwards: and in like manner does
the Sacrificer now, by means of the Vi*s*va*g*yotis, step over these
worlds, both from hence upwards, and from above downwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:1:24">8:7:1:24</span></span>24.
Now, the *K*arakâdhvaryus lay down here yet other 'stepping-stones'; but
let him not do so, for they do what is redundant, and these are indeed
the stepping-stones.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[125:3](sbe4326.htm#fr_227.md) Or, he places the
chieftaincy in every clan.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[126:1](sbe4326.htm#fr_228.md) Or, all this
universe.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[127:1](sbe4326.htm#fr_229.md) For the symbolic
meaning of the three svayam-ât*rinn*âs, as the central bricks of the
first and third layers, and the one lying on the centre of the fifth
layer, see part iii, p. 155, note 8.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[127:2](sbe4326.htm#fr_230.md) On the three
Vi*s*va*g*yotis bricks, placed in the same layers, as representing the
gods Agni, Vâyu and Âditya respectively, see VI, 3, 3, 16; 5, 3, 3.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[128:1](sbe4326.htm#fr_231.md) Or, But these
(bricks) also are (or mean) generative power, cf. [paragraph
1](sbe4326.htm#8:7:1:1.md).

<span id="fn_231"></span>[128:2](sbe4326.htm#fr_232.md) That is, he is not
to shift them from their proper place, but place each subsequent pair
exactly on those laid down before. As a matter of fact, however, these
two bricks (if we determine their site by mere calculation) would seem,
in the fifth layer, to lie by half a foot further away from the central
point, than the *Ri*tavyâs of the other layers do. This is owing to the
fact that whilst, in the layers in which a Svayamât*rinn*â lies in the
middle, only one half of these central bricks lie on the east side of
the central point, in the present layer the eastern -portion of the
Gârhapatya (occupying the central part of the layer) consists of
full-sized bricks. This discrepancy of half a foot was probably made
good by some space being left, which was afterwards filled up with
earth; unless, indeed, the Svayamât*rinn*âs, as apparently natural
stones, were allowed to somewhat exceed the ordinary size of bricks.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[131:1](sbe4326.htm#fr_233.md) For this verse see
part iii, p. 307, note 2; for its symbolic meaning (as the breath, or
vital air) VII, 1, 1, 15; 26. See also [VIII, 7, 3,
21](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:21.md), where the verse itself is explained.
