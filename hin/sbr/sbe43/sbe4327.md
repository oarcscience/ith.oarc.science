### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:1">8:7:2:1</span></span>1. He
then lays down a Lokamp*rin*â <span id="fr_234"></span>[2](#fn_233.md)
(space-filling brick); the Lokamp*rin*â, doubtless, is yonder

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

sun, for he fills these worlds: it is thus yonder sun he thereby sets
up. He lays down this (Lokamp*rin*â) in all the (five) layers, for those
layers are these (three) worlds <span id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_234.md):
he thus places the sun in (all) these worlds, whence he shines for all
these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:2">8:7:2:2</span></span>2. And,
again, as to why he lays down a Lokamp*rin*â,--the Lokamp*rin*â,
doubtless, is the nobility (or chieftaincy) <span
id="fr_236"></span>[2](#fn_235.md), and these other bricks are the peasants
(or clansmen): he thus places the nobility (or chieftain), as the eater,
among the peasantry. He lays it down in all the layers: he thus places
the nobility, as the eater, among the whole peasantry (or in every
clan).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:3">8:7:2:3</span></span>3. Now
this is only a single (brick): he thus makes the nobility (or the
chieftaincy) and (social) distinction to attach to a single (person).
And what second (such brick there is) that is its mate,--a mate,
doubtless, is one half of one's own self, for when one is with a mate
then he is whole and complete: (thus it is laid down) for the sake of
completeness. With a single formula he lays down many bricks <span
id="fr_237"></span>[3](#fn_236.md): he thereby endows the nobility
preeminently

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

with power <span id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_237.md), and makes the nobility
more powerful than the peasantry. And the other (bricks) he lays down
singly, with separate formulas: he thereby makes the peasantry less
powerful than the nobility, differing in speech, and of different
thoughts (from one another).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:4">8:7:2:4</span></span>4. The
first two (Lokamp*rin*âs) he lays down in that (south-east) corner: he
thereby places yonder sun in that quarter: from this (earth) he follows
him (the sun) from that (place) there <span
id="fr_239"></span>[2](#fn_238); from this (earth.md) he follows him from
that (place) there; from this (earth) he follows hire from that (place)
there; from this (earth) he follows him from that (place) there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:5">8:7:2:5</span></span>5. And in
whatever place he lays down the first two (bricks), let him there lay
down alongside of

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

them the last two (bricks): for (otherwise) having once revolved round
these worlds, that sun would not pass by them. Let him lay down the two
last alongside the two first by reaching over them: he thus causes that
sun to pass by these worlds; and hence that sun revolves incessantly
round these worlds again and again (from left) to right.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:6">8:7:2:6</span></span>6. \[He
lays them down, with, Vâ*g*. S. XV, 59\], 'Fill the space! fill the
gap!'--that is, 'fill up the space! fill up the gap;'--'and lie thou
steady!'--that is, 'and lie thou firm, settled!'--'Indra and Agni, and
B*ri*haspati, have settled thee in this womb;' that is, 'Indra and Agni,
and B*ri*haspati, have established thee in this womb.' Thus (he
establishes them) by an anush*t*ubh verse; for the Anush*t*ubh is
speech, and Indra is speech, and the space-filler is Indra. He does not
settle them, for that (sun) is unsettled. He pronounces the Sûdadohas on
them, for the Sûdadohas is vital air: he thus makes him (Agni)
continuous and joins him together by means of the vital air.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:7">8:7:2:7</span></span>7. Here
now they say, 'How does that Lokamp*rin*â become of unimpaired
strength?' Well, the Lokamp*rin*â is yonder sun, and he assuredly is of
unimpaired strength. And the Lokamp*rin*â also is speech, and of
unimpaired strength assuredly is speech.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:8">8:7:2:8</span></span>8. Having
laid down those (bricks) possessed of (special) sacrificial formulas, he
covers (the altar) with the Lokamp*rin*â; for the bricks possessed of
formulas mean food, and the Lokamp*rin*â means the body: he thus
encloses the food in the body, whence food enclosed in the body is the
body itself.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:9">8:7:2:9</span></span>9. Those
(bricks) possessed of formulas he places on the body (of the altar)
itself, not on the wings and tail: he thus puts food into the body; and
whatever food is put into the body that benefits both the body and the
wings and tail; but that which he puts on the wings and tail benefits
neither the body, nor the wings and tail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:10">8:7:2:10</span></span>10. On
the body (of the altar) he places both (bricks) possessed of formulas
and Lokamp*rin*âs; whence that body (of a bird) is, as it were, twice as
thick. On the wings and tail (he places) only Lokamp*rin*âs, whence the
wings and tail are, as it were, thinner. On the body (of the altar) he
places them both lengthwise and crosswise, for the bricks are bones:
hence these bones in the body run both lengthwise and crosswise. On the
wings and tail (he places them so as to be) turned away (from the body),
for in the wings and tail there is not a single transverse bone. And
this, indeed, is the difference between a built and an unbuilt (altar):
suchlike is the built one, different therefrom the unbuilt one <span
id="fr_240"></span>[1](#fn_239.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:11">8:7:2:11</span></span>11. The
Svayamât*rinn*â (naturally-perforated brick) he encloses with
Lokamp*rin*â (bricks); for the naturally-perforated one is the breath,
and the 'space-filler' is the sun: he thus kindles the breath by means
of the sun, whence this breath (of ours) is warm. With that (kind of
brick) he fills up the whole body: he thereby kindles the whole body by
means of the sun, whence this whole body (of ours) is warm. And this,
indeed, is the difference between one that will live and one that will
die:

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

he that will live is warm, and he that will die is cold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:12">8:7:2:12</span></span>12.
From the corner in which he lays down the first two (Lokamp*rin*âs) he
goes on filling up (the altar) by tens up to the Svayamât*rinn*â. In the
same way he goes on filling it up from left to right behind the
naturally-perforated one up to (the brick on) the cross-spine <span
id="fr_241"></span>[1](#fn_240.md). He then fills it up whilst returning to
that limit <span id="fr_242"></span>[2](#fn_241.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:13">8:7:2:13</span></span>13. The
body (of the altar) he fills up first, for of (a bird) that is produced,
the body is produced first, then the right wing, then the tail, then the
left (wing): that is in the rightward (sunwise) way, for this is (the
way) with the gods, and thus, indeed, yonder sun moves along these
worlds from left to right.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:14">8:7:2:14</span></span>14. The
Lokamp*rin*â, doubtless, is the same as the vital air; he therewith
fills up the whole body (of the altar): he thus puts vital air into the
whole body. If he were not to reach any member thereof, then the vital
air would not reach that member of him (Agni); and whatever member the
vital air does not reach, that, assuredly, either dries up or withers
away: let him therefore fill up therewith the whole of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:15">8:7:2:15</span></span>15. The
wings and tail he builds on to the body, for the wings and tail grow on
to the body; but were he first to lay down those (bricks) turned away
(from the body), it would be as if he were to take a limb from elsewhere
and put it on again.

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:16">8:7:2:16</span></span>16. Let
him not lay down either a broken (brick) or a black one; for one that is
broken causes failure, and sickly is that form which is black: 'Lest I
should make up a sickly body,' he thinks <span
id="fr_243"></span>[1](#fn_242.md). Let him not throw aside an unbroken
(brick), lest he should put what is not sickly outside the body.
Whatever (bricks), in counting from the dhish*n*ya hearths, should
exceed a Virâ*g* <span id="fr_244"></span>[2](#fn_243.md), and not make up
another, such (bricks) indeed cause failure: let him break them and
throw them <span id="fr_245"></span>[3](#fn_244) (ut-kir.md) on the heap of
rubbish (utkara), for the heap of rubbish is the seat of what is
redundant: thus he thereby settles them where there is. the seat of that
which is redundant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:17">8:7:2:17</span></span>17.
Now, then, of the measures of the bricks. In the first and last layers
let him lay down (bricks) of a foot (square), for the foot is a support;
and the hand is the same as the foot. The largest (bricks) should be of
the measure of the thigh-bone, for there is no bone larger than the
thigh-bone. Three layers should have (their bricks) marked with three
lines, for threefold are these worlds; and two (layers

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

may consist) of (bricks) marked with an indefinite number of lines, for
these two layers are the flavour, and the flavour is indefinite; but all
(the layers) should rather have (bricks) marked with three lines, for
threefold are all these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:18">8:7:2:18</span></span>18.
Now, then, of the location <span id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_245.md) of
(special) bricks. Any (special) brick he knows, provided with a formula,
let him place in the middle (third) layer; for the middle layer is the
air, and the air, doubtless, is the location of all beings. Moreover,
bricks with (special) formulas are food, and the middle layer is the
belly: he thus puts food into the belly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:7:2:19">8:7:2:19</span></span>19.
Here, now, they say, 'Let him not lay down (such special bricks) lest he
should do what is excessive.' But he may, nevertheless, lay them down;
for such bricks are laid down for (the fulfilment of special) wishes,
and in wishes there is nothing excessive. But let him rather not lay
them down, for just that much the gods then did.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_233"></span>[131:2](sbe4327.htm#fr_234.md) In laying down the
Lokamp*rin*âs of the fifth layer, he begins, as in the first layer, from
the right shoulder, or the south-east corner, of the altar, but so that
in this case the first 'space-filler' is laid down, not at the corner,
but a cubit to the west of it. Starting from that spot, he fills up the
available spaces, in two turns, moving in the sunwise fashion.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[132:1](sbe4327.htm#fr_235.md) Rather, the first,
second, and third layers are the three worlds.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[132:2](sbe4327.htm#fr_236.md) At VI, 1, 2, 25
Tâ*nd*ya was made to maintain that the Ya*g*ushmatîs, or bricks laid
down with special formulas, were the nobility, and that the
Lokamp*rin*âs, laid down with one and the same formula, were the
peasants, and as the noble (or chieftain) required a numerous clan for
his subsistence, there should be fewer of the former kind of bricks,
than the established practice was. This view was however rejected by the
author of the Brâhma*n*a, and here, in opposition to that view, the
Lokamp*rin*â is identified with the nobility, and the Ya*g*ushmatîs with
the clan.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[132:3](sbe4327.htm#fr_237.md) The common formula
used with these bricks, and from which they derive their name--beginning
as it does 'Lokam p*rin*a,' 'Fill the space!' see [parag.
6](sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:6.md)--is pronounced once only after every ten such
bricks, and after any odd ones at the end.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[133:1](sbe4327.htm#fr_238.md) In the translation
of VII, 5, 2, 14 (part iii, p. 404), the passage 'having taken
possession of the man by strength,' which was based on a wrong reading
(see Weber, Berl. Cat. II, p. 69), should read thus: 'having
pre-eminently endowed man with power' (or, perhaps, 'having placed him
above (others) in respect of power,' St. Petersb. Dict.)

<span id="fn_238"></span>[133:2](sbe4327.htm#fr_239.md) I do not know
whether 'atas' might be taken here in the sense of 'thither,' or whether
it goes along with 'tasmât,' merely strengthening it. The meaning in
either case would seem to be this. In the first turn of filling up the
empty spaces he first moves along from the south-east corner (the point
where the sun rises) to the back or west end of the spine (the place
where the sun sets) and the central brick; and having thus, as it were,
touched the earth again, he proceeds from there in the same sunwise
fashion, filling up the north part of the altar until he reaches the
east end of the spine, and there, as it were, touches the earth once
more. In the second turn he again begins (with the second brick) in the
south-east, and repeats the same process, in filling up the south part
of the altar, and completing at the southeast corner. The laying down of
the Lokamp*rin*âs would thus be supposed to occupy the full space of two
days and two nights.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[135:1](sbe4327.htm#fr_240.md) That is, one not
properly built.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[136:1](sbe4327.htm#fr_241.md) This would seem to
be the Vikar*n*î (see [VIII, 7, 3, 9](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:9) seqq..md) which,
however, like the central Svayamât*rinn*â, is only to be laid down after
the layer has been levelled up.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[136:2](sbe4327.htm#fr_242.md) Viz. to the east
end of the 'spine.'

<span id="fn_242"></span>[137:1](sbe4327.htm#fr_243.md) Here, as so often
before, the effect to be avoided is expressed by a clause in *oratio
directa* with 'ned'; the inserted clause with 'vai' indicating the
reason why that effect is to be dreaded. To adapt the passage to our own
mode of diction, we should have to translate:--Let him not lay down
either a broken brick or a black one, lest he should form a sickly body;
for a brick which is broken comes to grief, and what is black is of
sickly appearance.--In the next sentence of the translation, the direct
form of speech has been discarded.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[137:2](sbe4327.htm#fr_244.md) The pâda of the
Virâ*g* consists of ten, and a whole Virâ*g* stanza of thirty (or
forty), syllables. Hence the number of the bricks is to be divisible by
ten.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[137:3](sbe4327.htm#fr_245.md) Or, perhaps, dig
them in.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[138:1](sbe4327.htm#fr_246.md) Âvapana has also
the meaning of 'throwing in, insertion,' which is likewise understood
here, whilst further on in this paragraph ('the air is the âvapanam of
all beings') it can scarcely have this meaning (? something injected).
Cf. [IX, 4, 2, 27](sbe4340.htm#9:4:2:27.md).
