### CORRECTIONS.

Page 66, 1. 11, and note 1. The *K*atush*t*oma is such an arrangement of
the Stotras of a Soma-sacrifice in which the Stomas (or hymn-forms)
employed increase successively by four syllables. See notes on XI, 5, 2,
9; XIII, 3, 1, 4 (sic!).

P. 279, line 7. Perhaps this passage had better be translated thus,--And
he who, without having performed these (rites), should officiate even
for another person in the performance of any other sacrifices . . .

P. 296, l. 3 from bottom. Read,--Upavasatha.

P. 394-98, paragraphs 4-9; 11. Read,--repels recurrent death.

      ,, l. 5 from bottom. Read,--tasyâhutaya*s* (!).

   ,, end of note. Add,--In Sat. Br. V, 4, 3, 23, sa*m*grahît*ri*
certainly means charioteer.'

P. 113, l. 8. The chant here alluded to is the first (or Hot*ri*'s)
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra, for which see part ii, p. 339. The Abhishe*k*anîya
being, however, performed on the Ukthya, not on the Agnish*t*oma, model,
this stotra, on the present occasion, consists of the B*ri*hat-sâman
(see Introduction, pp. xvi, note 2; xxvi).

P. 360, note 1. Add,--See also VIII, 7, 3, 19, where that thread is

direction away from us.
