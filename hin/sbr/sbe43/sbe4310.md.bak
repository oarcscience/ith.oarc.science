### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:1">8:2:4:1</span></span>1. 'The
he-goat is vigour <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_92.md),'--the he-goat he
overtook by his vigour;--'gapless the metre,'--

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

the gapless metre, doubtless, is the Ekapadâ: in the form of Ekapadâ
(metre) the goats indeed went forth (from Pra*g*âpati).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:2">8:2:4:2</span></span>2. 'The
ram is vigour,'--the ram he overtook by his vigour;--'ample the
metre,'--the ample metre, doubtless, is the Dvipadâ: in the form of the
Dvipadâ the sheep indeed went forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:3">8:2:4:3</span></span>3. 'Man
is vigour,'--the man he overtook by his vigour;--'slow the metre,'--the
slow metre, doubtless, is the Paṅkti: in the form of the Paṅkti the men
indeed went forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:4">8:2:4:4</span></span>4. 'The
tiger is vigour,'--the tiger he overtook by his vigour;--'unassailable
the metre,'--the unassailable metre, doubtless, is the Virâ*g*, for the
Virâ*g* is food, and food is unassailable; in the form of the Virâ*g*
the tigers indeed went forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:5">8:2:4:5</span></span>5. 'The
lion is vigour,'--the lion he overtook by his vigour;--'the covering the
metre,'--the covering metre, doubtless, is the Ati*kkh*andas, for that
covers (includes) all metres: in the form of the Ati*kkh*andas the lions
indeed went forth. And so he places undefined metres along with defined
beasts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:6">8:2:4:6</span></span>6. 'The
ox is vigour,'--the ox he overtook by his vigour;--'the B*ri*hatî the
metre,'--in the form of the B*ri*hatî the oxen indeed went forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:7">8:2:4:7</span></span>7. 'The
bull is vigour,'--the bull he overtook by his vigour;--'the Kakubh the
metre,'--in the form of the Kakubh the bulls indeed went forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:8">8:2:4:8</span></span>8. 'The
steer is vigour,'--the steer he overtook by his vigour;--'the
Satob*ri*hatî the metre,'--in the form of the Satob*ri*hatî the steers
indeed went forth.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:9">8:2:4:9</span></span>9. 'The
bullock is vigour,'--the bullock he overtook by his vigour;--'the Paṅkti
the metre,'--in the form of the Paṅkti the bullocks indeed went forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:10">8:2:4:10</span></span>10.
'The milch cow is vigour,'--the milch cow he overtook by his
vigour;--'the *G*agatî the metre,'--in the form of the *G*agatî the
milch cows indeed went forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:11">8:2:4:11</span></span>11.
'The calf of eighteen months is vigour,'--the calf of eighteen months he
overtook by his vigour;--'the Trish*t*ubh the metre,'--in the form of
the Trish*t*ubh the calves of eighteen months indeed went forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:12">8:2:4:12</span></span>12.
'The two-year-old bull is vigour,'--the two-year-old bull he overtook by
his vigour;--'the Virâ*g* the metre,'--in the form of the Virâ*g* the
two-year-old kine indeed went forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:13">8:2:4:13</span></span>13.
'The bull of two years and a half is vigour,'--the bull of two years and
a half he overtook by his vigour;--'the Gâyatrî the metre,'--in the form
of the Gâyatrî the kine of two years and a half indeed went forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:14">8:2:4:14</span></span>14.
'The three-year-old bull is vigour,'--the three-year-old bull he
overtook by his vigour;--'the Ush*n*ih the metre,'--in the form of the
Ush*n*ih the three-year-old kine indeed went forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:15">8:2:4:15</span></span>15.
'The four-year-old bull is vigour,'--the four-year-old bull he overtook
by his vigour;--'the Anush*t*ubh the metre,'--in the form of the
Anush*t*ubh the four-year-old kine indeed went forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:16">8:2:4:16</span></span>16.
These then are those very beasts which Pra*g*âpati overtook by his
vigour. The animal he (the priest) mentions first, then vigour, then the

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

metre, for having hemmed them in with vigour and the metre, he put them
into himself, and made them his own; and in like manner does he (the
sacrificer) now hem them in with vigour and the metre, and put them into
himself, and make them his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:17">8:2:4:17</span></span>17. Now
that animal is the same as Agni: (as such) he is even now made up whole
and entire. Those (bricks) which he places in front are his head; those
on the right and left sides are his body, and those behind his tail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:18">8:2:4:18</span></span>18. He
first lays down those in front, for of an animal that is born the head
is born first. Having then laid down those on the right (south) side, he
lays down those on the left (north) side, thinking, 'Together with its
sides this body shall be born.' Then those behind, for of (the animal)
that is born the tail is born last.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:19">8:2:4:19</span></span>19. The
metres which are longest, and the animals which are biggest, he puts in
the middle: he thus makes the animal biggest towards the middle; whence
the animal is biggest towards the middle. And the animals which are the
strongest he puts on the right side: he thus makes the right side of an
animal the stronger; whence the right side of an animal is the stronger.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:2:4:20">8:2:4:20</span></span>20. The
fore and hind parts he makes smallest; for inasmuch as those (bricks in
front) are only four in number <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_93.md),
thereby they are the smallest; and inasmuch as here (at the back) he
puts the smallest animals, thereby these are the smallest: he thus makes
the fore and hind parts of an animal the smallest, whence the fore and
hind parts of an animal

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

are the smallest; and hence the animal rises and sits down by its fore
and hind parts. He then lays down two Lokamp*rin*â (bricks) in that
corner <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_94.md): the significance of them
(will be explained) further on <span id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_95.md). He
throws loose earth on the layer: the significance of this (will be
explained) further on <span id="fr_97"></span>[3](#fn_96.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_92"></span>[37:1](sbe4310.htm#fr_93.md) Mahîdhara, in
accordance with the explanation added by the Brâhma*n*a to this and the
corresponding formulas in the succeeding paragraphs, takes vayas' as a
defective instrumental (vayasâ). It is, however, very doubtful whether
such an interpretation of the formula was intended by the author of the
Brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[40:1](sbe4310.htm#fr_94.md) See [p.
35](sbe4309.htm#page_35), note [2](sbe4309.htm#fn_90.md).

<span id="fn_94"></span>[41:1](sbe4310.htm#fr_95.md) Whilst, in laying down
the Lokamp*rin*âs of the first layer, he started from the right shoulder
(or south-east corner) of the altar (see [p. 22](sbe4306.htm#page_22.md),
note [1](sbe4307.htm#fn_73).md), in this layer he begins from the right hip
(or south west-corner), filling up the available spaces, in two turns,
in sunwise fashion.
