### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:5:1">10:6:5:1</span></span>1.
Verily, there was nothing here in the beginning: by Death this
(universe) was covered, by hunger, for Death is hunger. He created for
himself this mind, thinking, 'May I have a soul.' He went on
worshipping. Whilst he was worshipping the waters were produced.
'Verily, to me worshipping (ar*k*) water (kam) has been produced,' thus
(he thought): this, indeed, is the Arka-nature of the Arkya <span
id="fr_831"></span>[1](#fn_818); and, verily, there is joy (kam) for him
who thus knows the Arka-nature of the Arkya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:5:2">10:6:5:2</span></span>2. The
Arka, doubtless, is the waters; and the cream (froth) which was on the
waters was compacted, and became this earth. Thereon he wearied himself,
and the glow and essence (sweat) of him thus wearied and heated
developed into Fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:5:3">10:6:5:3</span></span>3. He
made himself threefold--(Agni being one-third), Âditya one-third, and
Vâyu one-third: that is this threefold breath. The eastern quarter was
his head, this and that (intermediate quarters) are his fore-feet, the
western quarter his tail, this and that (intermediate quarters) his
thighs, the southern and northern quarters his flanks; the sky his back,
the air his belly, and this (earth) his chest:--on the waters he was
established any and everywhere, and so indeed is he established who
knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:5:4">10:6:5:4</span></span>4. He
desired, 'May a second self be produced for me.' By his mind he entered
into union with speech,--(to wit) Death with hunger: the seed which was
produced became the year, for theretofore there was no year. For as long
as the year he (Death) carried him (within him), and at the end of

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

that time he produced him <span id="fr_832"></span>[1](#fn_819). He
opened his mouth (to devour) the new-born one, and he (the child) cried
'bhâ*n*'; thus speech was produced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:5:5">10:6:5:5</span></span>5. He
bethought him, 'Surely, if I kill him, I shall gain but little
food <span id="fr_833"></span>[2](#fn_820).' By that speech and that
soul of his he created all this (universe) whatsoever there is,--*Rik*
(hymn-verses), Ya*g*us (formulas), Sâman (hymn-tunes), metres,
sacrifices, men, and beasts. And whatsoever he created he set about
devouring; and because he eats (ad) everything, hence the name 'Aditi';
and, verily, he who thus knows the nature of Aditi becomes an eater of
everything, and all food becomes his.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:5:6">10:6:5:6</span></span>6. He
desired, 'May I again sacrifice by yet another sacrifice.' He wearied
himself and practised austerity. From him, thus wearied and heated,
glory and vigour departed; and glory and vigour, indeed, are the vital
airs. The vital airs having departed, that body of his began to swell.
The mind was yet in the body;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:5:7">10:6:5:7</span></span>7. He
desired, 'May this (body) of mine be sacrificially pure: may I thereby
be possessed of a self!' Thereupon the horse (a*s*va) was produced; and
because that which was swelling <span id="fr_834"></span>[3](#fn_821)
(a*s*vat) became pure (medhya) therefore the name A*s*vamedha (belongs
to that sacrifice). He, indeed, knows the A*s*vamedha who thus knows
him <span id="fr_835"></span>[4](#fn_822).

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:5:8">10:6:5:8</span></span>8. He
bethought him of leaving it unrestrained <span
id="fr_836"></span>[1](#fn_823). At the end of a year he slaughtered it
for his own self, and made over the (sacrificial) animals to the
deities: therefore they slaughter the consecrated (victim) as one that,
in its nature as Pra*g*âpati, represents all the deities. But the
A*s*vamedha, in truth, is he that shines yonder (the sun), and the year
is his body. The Arka is this Fire, and these worlds are his bodies.
These two are the Arka and A*s*vamedha; but these, indeed, become again
one deity, to wit, Death. And, verily, whosoever knows this, conquers
recurrent Death, and Death has no hold on him: Death is his own self; he
attains all life, and becomes one of those deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:6:5:9">10:6:5:9</span></span>9. Now
the line of succession (of teachers). The same as far as Sâ*mg*îvîputra.
Sâ*mg*îvîputra (received it) from Mâ*nd*ûkâyani, Mâ*nd*ûkâyani from
Mâ*n*davya, Mâ*n*davya from Kautsa, Kautsa from Mâhitthi, Mâhitthi from
Vâmakakshâya*n*a, Vâmakakshâya*n*a from Vâtsya, Vâtsya from
*S*â*nd*ilya, *S*â*nd*ilya from Ku*s*ri, Ku*s*ri from Yag*ñ*ava*k*as
Râ*g*astambâyana, Ya*gñ*ava*k*as Râ*g*astambâyana from Tura Kâvasheya,
Tura Kâvasheya from Pra*g*âpati, Pra*g*âpati from Brahman (n.). Brahman
is the self-existent: reverence be to Brahman!
