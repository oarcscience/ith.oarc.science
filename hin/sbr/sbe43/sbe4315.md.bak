#### THE FOURTH LAYER.

### FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:1">8:4:1:1</span></span>1. He
lays down the fourth layer. For the gods having laid down the third
layer, now ascended; but, the third layer being the air; it was the air
which, having completed it, they ascended.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:2">8:4:1:2</span></span>2. They
spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed,

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! Seek ye (to build) from hence
upwards!' Whilst meditating, they saw that fourth layer, (to wit) what
is above the air and below the heavens; that world was to their minds,
as it were, unstable and unsettled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:3">8:4:1:3</span></span>3. They
said to the Brahman, 'We will lay thee down (or, set thee up)
here!'--'What will therefrom accrue to me?'--'Thou shalt be the highest
of us!'--'So be it!' They accordingly laid the Brahman down here, whence
people say that the Brahman is the highest of gods. Now, by this fourth
layer these two, heaven and earth, are upheld, and the fourth layer is
the Brahman, whence people say that heaven and earth are upheld by the
Brahman. He lays down the Stomas (hymn-forms) <span
id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_130.md): the stomas being the vital airs, and
the Brahman also being the vital airs, it is the Brahman he thereby lays
down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:4">8:4:1:4</span></span>4. And,
again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. The gods, at that time, said
to Pra*g*âpati, 'We will lay thee down here! So be it!' He did not say,
'What will therefrom accrue unto me?' but whenever Pra*g*âpati wished to
obtain anything from the gods, they said, 'What will therefrom accrue to
us?' And hence even now if a father wishes to obtain anything from his
sons, they say, 'What will therefrom

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

accrue unto us?' and when the sons (wish to obtain anything) from the
father, he says, 'So be it!' for in this way Pra*g*âpati and the gods
used of old to converse together. He lays down the Stomas: the stomas
being the vital airs, and Pra*g*âpati also being the vital airs, it is
Pra*g*âpati he thus lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:5">8:4:1:5</span></span>5. And,
again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. Those vital airs, the
*Ri*shis <span id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_131.md), that saw this fourth
layer <span id="fr_133"></span>[2](#fn_132.md), and who stepped nigh with
that essential element (of the altar), are these (vital airs): it is
them he now lays down. He lays down the Stomas:--the stomas being the
vital airs, and the *Ri*shis also being the vital airs, it is the
*Ri*shis he thus lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:6">8:4:1:6</span></span>6. And,
again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. When Pra*g*âpati had become
relaxed (disjointed), the gods took him and went away. Vâyu, taking that
(part) of him which was above the waist and below the head, kept going
away from him, having become the deities and the forms of the year.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:7">8:4:1:7</span></span>7. He
spake to him, 'Come to me and restore to me that wherewith thou hast
gone from me!'--'What will therefrom accrue unto me?'--'That part of my
self shall be sacred unto thee!'--'So be it!' thus Vâyu restored that
unto him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:8">8:4:1:8</span></span>8. Those
eighteen (bricks <span id="fr_134"></span>[3](#fn_133).md) which there are
at

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

first, are that very (part) of his (Pra*g*âpati's) body; and when he
places them in this (layer), he thereby restores to him that (part) of
his body which these (form): therefore he places them in this (layer).
He lays down the Stomas: the stomas being the vital airs, and Vâyu (the
wind) also being the vital airs, it is Vâyu he thus lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:9">8:4:1:9</span></span>9. In
front he lays down one, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 23), 'The swift one, the
Triv*ri*t!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is triv*ri*t
(threefold, or thrice-three-versed). And as to why he calls it 'the
swift one,' it is because this, indeed, is the swiftest of stomas. But
the swift threefold one, doubtless, is Vâyu: he exists in these three
worlds. And as to why he calls him 'the swift one,' it is because he is
the swiftest of all beings: being (or, in the form of) Vâyu it remained
in front,--it is that form he now lays down,

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:10">8:4:1:10</span></span>10.
\[The back one <span id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_134.md), with\], 'The
bright one <span id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_135.md), the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a!' he
therewith lays down that

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

hymn-form which is fifteenfold (fifteen-versed). And when he calls it
'the bright one,' it is that the bright one is the thunderbolt, and the
thunderbolt is fifteenfold. But the bright, fifteenfold one, doubtless,
also is the Moon: he waxes during fifteen days, and wanes during fifteen
days. And as to his calling him 'the bright one,' the Moon indeed
shines: being the Moon it remained on the right side,--it is that form
he now lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:11">8:4:1:11</span></span>11.
\[The left (north) one, with\], 'The (aerial) space, the Saptada*s*a!'
he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is seventeenfold. And as to
his calling it 'the space,'--the (aerial) space is Pra*g*âpati, and the
seventeenfold one is Pra*g*âpati. But indeed the seventeenfold space
also is the year: in it there are twelve months and five seasons. And as
to his calling it space, the year indeed is space: being space, it
remained on the left side,--it is that form he now lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:12">8:4:1:12</span></span>12.
\[The right (south) one, with\], 'The upholder, the Ekavi*ms*a!' he
therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-one-fold. And as to
his calling it 'the upholder,'--the upholder means a foothold, and the
Ekavi*ms*a is a foothold. But indeed the twenty-one-fold upholder also
is yonder sun: to him belong the twelve months, the five seasons, these
three worlds, and yonder sun himself is the upholder, the
twenty-one-fold. And as to his calling him 'the upholder,'--when he sets
everything here holds its peace: being the sun, it remained at the
back,--it is that form he now lays down; and the forms of the year he
lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:13">8:4:1:13</span></span>13.
'Speed, the Ash*t*âda*s*a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which
is eighteenfold. Now,

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

speed, the eighteenfold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are
twelve months, five seasons, and the year itself is speed, the
eighteenfold. And as to his calling it 'speed,' the year indeed speeds
all beings: it is that form he now lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:14">8:4:1:14</span></span>14.
'Heat, the Navada*s*a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is
nineteenfold. But heat, the nineteenfold one, doubtless, is the year: in
it there are twelve months, six seasons, and the year itself is heat,
the nineteenfold. And as to his calling it 'heat,' the year indeed burns
all beings: it is that form he now lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:15">8:4:1:15</span></span>15.
'Victorious assault, the Savi*ms*a!' he therewith lays down that
hymn-form which is twentyfold. But victorious assault, the twentyfold
one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twelve months, seven
seasons, and the year itself is victorious assault, the twentyfold. And
as to why he calls it 'victorious assault,' the year indeed assails all
beings: it is that form he now lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:16">8:4:1:16</span></span>16.
'Vigour, the Dvâvi*ms*a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is
twenty-two-fold. But vigour, the twenty-two-fold one, doubtless is the
year: in it there are twelve months, seven seasons, the two, day and
night, and the year itself is vigour, the twenty-two-fold. And as to why
he calls it 'vigour,' the year is indeed the most vigorous of all
existing things: it is that form he now lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:17">8:4:1:17</span></span>17.
'The array, the Trayovi*ms*a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form
which is twenty-three-fold. But array, the twenty-three-fold one,
doubtless, means the year: in it there are thirteen months, seven
seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is the array, the
twenty-three-fold.

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And as to his
calling it 'array,' the year is indeed arrayed over all beings: it is
that form he now lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:18">8:4:1:18</span></span>18.
'The womb, the *K*aturvi*ms*a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form
which is twenty-four-fold. But the womb, the twenty-four-fold one,
doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months. And as
to his calling it 'the womb,' the year is indeed the womb of all beings:
it is that form he now lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:19">8:4:1:19</span></span>19.
'The embryos, the Pa*ñk*avi*ms*a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form
which is twenty-five-fold. But the embryos, the twenty-five-fold one,
doubtless; is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, and the
year itself is the embryos, the twenty-five-fold. And as to his calling
it 'the embryos,'--the year, as an embryo, in the shape of the
thirteenth month, enters the seasons: it is that form he now lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:20">8:4:1:20</span></span>20.
'Strength, the Tri*n*ava!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which
is thrice ninefold. And as to his calling it 'strength,'--strength
(o*g*as) means the thunderbolt (va*g*ra), and the Tri*n*ava is a
thunderbolt. But strength also means the year: in it there are
twenty-four half-months, the two, day and night, and the year itself is
strength, the thrice-ninefold. And as to his calling it 'strength,' the
year indeed is the strength of all beings: it is that form he now lays
down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:21">8:4:1:21</span></span>21.
'Design, the Ekatri*ms*a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which
is thirty-one-fold. But design, the thirty-one-fold, doubtless, means
the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, six seasons, and the
year itself is design, the thirty-one-fold. And

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

as to his calling it 'design,' the year indeed designs (makes, forms)
all beings: it is that form he now lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:22">8:4:1:22</span></span>22.
'The foundation, the Trayastri*ms*a!' he therewith lays down that
hymn-form which is thirty-three-fold. And as to why he calls it 'the
foundation,' the thirty-three-fold is indeed a foundation. But indeed
the foundation, the thirty-three-fold, also is the year: in it there are
twenty-four half-months, six seasons, the two, day and night, and the
year itself is the foundation, the thirty-three-fold. And as to his
calling it 'the foundation,' the year is indeed the foundation of all
beings: it is that form he now lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:23">8:4:1:23</span></span>23.
'The range of the ruddy one, the *K*atustri*ms*a!' he therewith lays
down that hymn-form which is thirty-four-fold. But the range of the
ruddy one (the sun), the thirty-four-fold one, doubtless, is the year:
in it there are twenty-four half-months, seven seasons, the two, day and
night, and the year itself is the range of the ruddy one, the
thirty-four-fold. And as to his calling it 'the range of the ruddy one,'
the range of the ruddy one, doubtless, means supreme sway, and the
thirty-four-fold one means supreme sway: it is that form he now lays
down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:24">8:4:1:24</span></span>24.
'The firmament, the Sha*t*tri*ms*a!' he therewith lays down that
hymn-form which is thirty-six-fold. But the firmament, the
thirty-six-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four
half-moons, and twelve months. And as to why he calls it 'the firmament'
(nâkam), it is because there is no pain (na akam) for whosoever goes
there. And the firmament indeed is the year, the heavenly world is the
year: it is that form he now lays down.

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:25">8:4:1:25</span></span>25.
'The revolving sphere, the Ash*t*â*k*atvâri*ms*a!' he therewith lays
down that hymn-form which is forty-eight-fold. But the revolving sphere,
the forty-eight-fold, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-six
half-months, thirteen months, seven seasons, and the two, day and night.
And as to his calling it 'the revolving sphere,' from the year all
creatures indeed are evolved: it is that form he now lays down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:26">8:4:1:26</span></span>26.
'The stay, the *K*atush*t*oma!' he therewith lays down the chant of
praise consisting of four stomas <span id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_136.md).
And as to his calling it 'the stay,'--stay means support, and the
*K*atush*t*oma is a support. But the stay, the *K*atush*t*oma,
doubtless, is Vâyu (the wind), for he sings from all those four
quarters. And as to his calling him 'the stay,'--stay means support; and
the wind indeed is the support of all beings: it is that form he now
lays down. The wind he places first and last: by the wind he thus
encloses all these beings on both sides.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:27">8:4:1:27</span></span>27.
These, then, are eighteen bricks he lays down; this makes two
Triv*ri*ts,--the Triv*ri*t being breath, and breath being wind, this
layer is Vâyu.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:1:28">8:4:1:28</span></span>28. And
as to why there are eighteen,--the year is eighteenfold: twelve months
and six seasons. And Pra*g*âpati indeed is the year, Pra*g*âpati is
eighteenfold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great
he makes it when he lays it down.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_130"></span>[59:1](sbe4315.htm#fr_131.md) This refers to the
first eighteen bricks of the fourth layer; but as the names of the
bricks (ish*t*akâ, f.) are invariably of the feminine gender, it is
doubtful whether stoma (m.), in this case, is meant as the designation
of these bricks, or merely as their symbolical analogon. In the former
case, one would rather, from the analogy of other bricks, expect some
such term as 'stomyâ.' To the first four of them Mahîdhara, on Vâ*g*. S.
XIV, 23, applies the epithet m*ri*tyumohinî, or 'confounders of death.'

<span id="fn_131"></span>[60:1](sbe4315.htm#fr_132.md) See VI, 1, 1, 1;
VII, 2, 3, 5.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[60:2](sbe4315.htm#fr_133.md) See VI, 2, 3, 7. 8.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[60:3](sbe4315.htm#fr_134.md) These eighteen
bricks, representing the Stomas, or hymn-forms, are laid down in the
following order. At each end of the spine (running from west to east)
one brick, of the size of the shank (from knee to ankle), is placed,
with its line-marks running from west to east; the eastern one being
placed north, and the western one south, of the spine. Thereupon an
ordinary brick, a foot square, is placed <span id="page_61">p. 61</span>
at the southern end of the 'cross-spine,' so as to lie on the spine
(though not apparently exactly in the middle, but so that only
one-fourth of the brick lies on one side of the spine) with its
line-marks running from south to north; and a second brick of the same
size is placed on the north, but so as to leave the full space of
another such brick between it and the northern edge of the altar. Behind
(west of) the front brick, fourteen half-foot bricks are then laid down,
in a row from north to south, seven on each side of the spine.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[61:1](sbe4315.htm#fr_135.md) The formulas of the
first four of these (stoma) bricks are not given here (in paragraphs
[9](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:9)-[12](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:12).md) in the order in
which the bricks are actually laid down, viz. E. W. S. N., but in the
order E. S. N. W.; cp. Kâtyây. *S*rautas. XVII, 10, 6-9. For a symbolic
explanation of this change of order see [VIII, 4, 4,
1](sbe4318.htm#8:4:4:1.md) seq.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[61:2](sbe4315.htm#fr_136.md) Or, perhaps, 'the
angry one.' The author of the Brâhma*n*a, however, evidently connects
'bhânta' with the root 'bhâ,' to shine.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[66:1](sbe4315.htm#fr_137.md) For particulars on
the *K*atush*t*oma, see note on [XIII, 1, 3, 4](sbe4305.htm#8:1:3:4.md).
