<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_162"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 162</FONT></A></p>  
<p>into the (different) forms. Agni became aware of it,--'Surely, Father Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is searching for me: well then, let me be suchlike that he knows me not.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:2">6:2:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. He saw those five animals,--the Purusha (man), the horse, the bull, the ram, and the he-goat. Inasmuch as he saw (pa<I>s</I>) them, they are (called) cattle (pa<I>s</I>u).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:3">6:2:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. He entered into those five animals; he became those five animals. But Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati still searched for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:4">6:2:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. He saw those five animals. Because he saw (pa<I>s</I>) them, therefore they are animals (pa<I>s</I>u); or rather, because he saw him (Agni) in them, therefore they are animals.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:5">6:2:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. He considered, 'They are Agni: I will fit them unto mine own self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Even as Agni, when kindled, glares, so their eye glares; even as Agni's smoke rises upwards, so vapour rises from them; even as Agni consumes what is put in him, so they devour; even as Agni's ashes fall down, so do their faeces: they are indeed Agni; I will fit them unto mine own self.' He meant to slaughter them for different deities: the Purusha (man) for Vi<I>s</I>vakarman, the horse for Varu<I>n</I>a, the bull for Indra, the ram for Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>, the he-goat for Agni.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:6">6:2:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. He considered, 'For different deities, indeed, I mean to slaughter now; but I myself desire (kam)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Agni's forms: well then, I will slaughter them for the Agnis, as for the (object of my) desire.' He slaughtered them for the Agnis, as for (his) desire,--to wit, 'for the Agnis,' because many were the forms of Agni he had set his mind upon; and 'for the desire,' because it was with a desire that he slaughtered them. Having appeased them and carried the fire round them, he led them northwards and slew them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:7">6:2:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. He considered, 'Those glories (signs of excellence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_330"></A><A HREF="#fn_330"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>) upon which I have set my mind are contained in the heads: well then, I will only put on the heads&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_331"></A><A HREF="#fn_331"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.' He cut off the heads and put them on (himself, or the altar). The remaining trunks he then let float on the water &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_332"></A><A HREF="#fn_332"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and brought the sacrifice to its completion by means of (the offering of) a he-goat, thinking, 'Lest my sacrifice be pulled to pieces.' After performing that animal sacrifice, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati saw that he had not yet reached the end of Agni (the fire-altar).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:8">6:2:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. He considered, 'I must search for that body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_333"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> which I let float on the water.' He searched for it; and what (part) of those (bodies) cast into the water had settled therein, that water he gathered; and what (had settled) in this earth, that clay (he gathered)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_334"></A><A HREF="#fn_334"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. And having gathered both that clay</p>

<p>

<p><A NAME="page_164"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and water, he made a brick: hence a brick consists of these two, clay and water.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:9">6:2:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. He considered, 'Surely, if I fit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_335"></A><A HREF="#fn_335"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> this (matter) such as it is unto mine own self, I shall become a mortal carcase, not freed from evil: well then, I will bake it by means of the fire.' So saying, he baked it by means of the fire, and thereby made it immortal; for the sacrificial food which is baked by fire is indeed immortal (or, ambrosia). Hence they bake the bricks with fire: they thereby make them immortal.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:10">6:2:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. And inasmuch as he saw them after offering (ish<I>t</I>v&acirc;) the animal, therefore they are bricks (ish<I>t</I>ak&acirc;). Hence one must make the bricks only after performing an animal sacrifice; for those which are made before (or, without) an animal sacrifice are 'anish<I>t</I>ak&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_336"></A><A HREF="#fn_336"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.' And, moreover, there is this other (consideration).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:11">6:2:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. As to those glories, they are these same heads of the victims; and those (headless) trunks are these five layers (of the fire-altar): thus when he builds up the layers after putting on the heads of the victims, he thereby unites those trunks with those heads.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:12">6:2:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. And because Agni is all those animal victims, therefore animals delight (being) near the fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_337"></A><A HREF="#fn_337"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>,--</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_165"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 165</FONT></A></p>  
<p>there animals sport with animals. Hence the (sacrificial) fire is set up with him who possesses cattle; for inasmuch as Agni (was) the same as cattle, therefore Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (the lord of creatures or generation) became Agni.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:13">6:2:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. Here now some say, 'It is at this (point of the performance) that he should offer up all those (five) victims; for had Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati then offered up all of them, he would certainly have reached the end of the fire (altar): hence were he (the Sacrificer) now to offer up all those (victims) he would certainly reach the end of the fire (altar).' Let him not do so: he thus would stray from where the gods have gone, he would stray from the path;--and what would he then gather&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_338"></A><A HREF="#fn_338"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>? For those same bodies, those layers, he gathers: let him therefore not do so.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:14">6:2:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. Now when he slaughters those animals, he prepares a home for Agni; for nowhere but in his home does one enjoy himself. But the home means food: it is that he lays down in, front, and when Agni sees that, he turns unto him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:15">6:2:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. There are a man, a horse, a bull, a ram, and a he-goat; for such are all the animals (used for sacrifice). Animals are food: he thus lays down in front whatever food there is; and seeing that, Agni turns unto him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:16">6:2:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. There are five; for there are those five Agnis,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_166"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 166</FONT></A></p>  
<p>to wit, the five layers (of the fire-altar): for them he thus lays down five homes; and seeing that, Agni turns unto him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:17">6:2:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. And when (he offers) 'to the Agnis,'--it is because there are here many Agnis, to wit, those layers; and when (he offers) 'to the desire,' it is in order that the Sacrificer may obtain the object for which he performs that ceremony.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:18">6:2:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. A man (purusha) he slaughters first, for man is the first of animals; then a horse, for the horse comes after man; then a bull, for the bull (or cow) comes after the horse; then a ram, for the sheep comes after the cow; then a he-goat, for the goat comes after the sheep: thus he slaughters them according to their form, according to their excellence.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:19">6:2:1:19</A></FONT></span>19. Their ropes may be unequal; that of the man being the longest, then shorter and shorter: thus he makes the ropes according to the form of the animals, to avoid confusion between good and bad. But let them be all alike, all similar; for all these victims are alike, all similar, for they are (all) called Agnis, they are called food: hence they are alike and similar.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:20">6:2:1:20</A></FONT></span>20. Here now they say, 'How is that complete five-bricked fire of his gained in the animals?'--Well, in the kap&acirc;las of the sacrificial cakes that first brick, the earthen one, is obtained; and when he slaughters the animal, thereby the animal brick is obtained, and when two gold chips are (placed) on both sides of the omentum, thereby the gold brick is obtained; and what firewood, stake, and enclosing sticks there are, thereby the wooden brick is obtained; and what ghee, sprinkling-water, and cake there are, thereby the fifth brick, the food, is</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_167"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 167</FONT></A></p>  
<p>obtained: thus then that complete five-bricked fire of his is gained in the animals.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:21">6:2:1:21</A></FONT></span>21. For these (victims) there are twenty-four kindling-verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_339"></A><A HREF="#fn_339"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for the year consists of twenty-four half-moons, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:22">6:2:1:22</A></FONT></span>22. And, again, why there are twenty-four,--the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; consists of twenty-four syllables, and Agni is G&acirc;yatra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_340"></A><A HREF="#fn_340"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:23">6:2:1:23</A></FONT></span>23. And, again, why there are twenty-four,--man (purusha) doubtless is twenty-fourfold: ten fingers of the hands, ten toes, and four limbs; and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the Purusha, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:24">6:2:1:24</A></FONT></span>24. He recites both g&acirc;yatr&icirc; and trish<I>t</I>ubh verses; for the g&acirc;yatr&icirc; metre is the vital air, and the trish<I>t</I>ubh is the body (self): by the g&acirc;yatr&icirc; verses he thus kindles his vital air, and by the trish<I>t</I>ubh ones the body. The trish<I>t</I>ubh verses are in the middle, and the g&acirc;yatr&icirc; verses on both sides thereof; for this body is in the middle, and the (organs of) the vital airs are on the sides thereof. He pronounces more g&acirc;yatr&icirc; verses before, and fewer after (the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A></p>  
<p>trish<I>t</I>ubh verses); for there are more (organs of the) vital airs in front, and fewer behind.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:25">6:2:1:25</A></FONT></span>25. He recites (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXVII, 1), 'May the months&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_341"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, O Agni, may the seasons make thee grow!' When Agni restored the relaxed Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, he (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati) said to him, 'What kindling-verses there are equal to me (in measure), with them kindle me!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:26">6:2:1:26</A></FONT></span>26. He (Agni) saw these (verses), 'May the months, O Agni, may the seasons make thee grow!' that is, 'May both the months, O Agni, and the seasons make thee grow!'--'The years, the <I>Ri</I>shis, whatsoever truths' that is, 'May the years, and the <I>Ri</I>shis, and the truths make thee grow!'--'With heavenly brightness do thou shine!'--the heavenly brightness doubtless is yonder sun: thus 'together with that do thou shine!'--'lighten up the whole four regions!' that is, 'lighten up all the four regions!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:27">6:2:1:27</A></FONT></span>27. These (verses) have one and the same explanation regarding him (Agni-Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati): how one would make him complete, how he would restore and produce him. They relate to Agni and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati: to Agni, inasmuch as Agni saw (them); to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, inasmuch as he (Agni) kindled Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:28">6:2:1:28</A></FONT></span>28. Twelve &Acirc;pr&icirc; (propitiatory) verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_342"></A><A HREF="#fn_342"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> there are,--twelve months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus propitiates (or gratifies) him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:29">6:2:1:29</A></FONT></span>29. And, again, why there are twelve,--of twelve syllables consists the <I>G</I>agat&icirc;, and the <I>G</I>agat&icirc; is this earth, for on her there is everything that moves (<I>g</I>ag-at) here. And Agni also is this earth, for it is out of her that the whole fire (altar) is built up: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus propitiates him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:30">6:2:1:30</A></FONT></span>30. And, again, why there are twelve,--of twelve syllables consists the <I>G</I>agat&icirc;, and the <I>G</I>agat&icirc; is all the metres, and all the metres are Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (the sacrifice), and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus propitiates him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:31">6:2:1:31</A></FONT></span>31. Those 'kindling-sticks of his (Agni) are upright.' When Agni restored the relaxed Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, he said to him, 'What &Acirc;pr&icirc;-verses there are equal to me, with them propitiate me!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:32">6:2:1:32</A></FONT></span>32. He saw these (verses)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_343"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>:--'Upright are his kindling-sticks,' for upright indeed are the kindling-sticks of him when kindled;--'upwards tending the bright flashes of Agni,' for tending upwards are his bright flashes, his flames;--'they, the most brilliant,' that is 'the most powerful;'--'of the fair-looking son,' for fair-looking indeed Agni is on all sides; and inasmuch as he (the Sacrificer) produces him thereby he (Agni) is his son.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:33">6:2:1:33</A></FONT></span>33. These (verses) have one and the same explanation regarding him (Agni-Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati): how one would make him complete, how he would restore and produce him. They relate to Agni and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati,--to Agni, inasmuch as Agni saw (them); to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, inasmuch as he (Agni) propitiated Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:34">6:2:1:34</A></FONT></span>34. They are unequal, and consist of unequal feet, and unequal syllables; for the metres are unequal: whatever unequal limbs there are at his (Agni's) body, those (limbs) of his he propitiates by these (verses).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:35">6:2:1:35</A></FONT></span>35. The animal cake belongs to (Agni) Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara--Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara being all the fires--for the obtainment of all the fires.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:36">6:2:1:36</A></FONT></span>36. As to why it belongs to Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara;--those layers (of the altar) no doubt are the seasons, for the seasons are the fires; and the seasons are the year, and the year is Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara (belonging to all men). Were it (offered) to Agni (Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara), he would cause it (the formula) to be redundant. It is one on twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and the year is Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara. The offering and invitatory formulas relate to Agni, for the obtainment of Agni's forms. They contain the word 'k&acirc;ma' (desire), for the obtainment of his desires.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:37">6:2:1:37</A></FONT></span>37. Now some, having in that way&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_344"></A><A HREF="#fn_344"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> obtained those heads, put them on (the fire-altar), thinking, 'Either way&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_345"></A><A HREF="#fn_345"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are they animals.' But they (who do this) become mortal carcases, for unpropitiated are</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A></p>  
<p>those (heads) of theirs. In this way, indeed, they did put them on for Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>i Sau<I>s</I>romateya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_346"></A><A HREF="#fn_346"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; but quickly indeed he died after that.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:38">6:2:1:38</A></FONT></span>38. Some, however, make gold ones, saying, 'They are immortal bricks (am<I>ri</I>tesh<I>t</I>ak&acirc;).' But indeed those are false bricks (an<I>ri</I>tesh<I>t</I>ak&acirc;), those are no heads of victims.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:1:39">6:2:1:39</A></FONT></span>39. Some, again, make earthen ones, thinking, 'Passed away, forsooth, are these animals, and this earth is the shelter of all that has passed away: thus whither those animals have gone, from thence we collect them.' Let him not do so, for whoso knows not both the practice and theory of these (victims), for him let them be passed away. Let him slaughter those very five victims, as far as he may be able to do so; for it was these Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati was the first to slaughter, and <I>S</I>y&acirc;par<I>n</I>a S&acirc;yak&acirc;yana the last; and in the interval also people used to slaughter them. But nowadays only these two are slaughtered, the one for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and the one for V&acirc;yu. The theory of these two is now (to be) told.</p>

Cf. <a href="sbe4154.htm#6:8:2:1">VI, 8, 2, 1</A>, where there is no question of changing the whole sacrifice into a heap of ashes, but of taking over the ashes, or some of it, to form part of the sacrifice.</P>

XVI, 1, 11) are to be inserted between the two verses containing the words 'samidhyam&acirc;na' (being kindled) and 'samiddha' (kindled) respectively,--that is, between the ninth and tenth of the normal or g&acirc;yatr&icirc; kindling-verses (cf.

<P><A NAME="fn_341"></A><A HREF="sbe4131.htm#fr_341">168:1</A> This is the meaning assigned here to 'sam&acirc;<I>h</I>' by Mah&icirc;dhara, a doubtful meaning indeed. Besides the ordinary meaning year,' the St. Petersburg dictionary also allows to 'sam&acirc;' that of 'half-year' in some passages of the Atharva-veda. In the present passage, the dictionary refers 'sam&acirc;<I>h</I>' to the adjective 'sama,' hence 'the equal seasons.' This cannot, however, have been the meaning assigned to the word by the author of this part of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, whatever it may originally have been in this verse of the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, Taitt. S. IV, 1, 7, takes 'sam&acirc;<I>h</I>' in the sense of 'the years,' but remarks that 'the months and half-months' have to be understood by it in this verse.</P>
