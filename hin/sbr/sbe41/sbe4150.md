### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:1">6:7:2:1</span></span>1.
Standing he puts on that (gold plate) <span
id="fr_517"></span>[1](#fn_515.md),--for that gold plate is yonder sun, and
yonder sun stands, as it were; and moreover, while standing one is
stronger. \[He does so\] standing with his face towards north-east: the
significance of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:2">6:7:2:2</span></span>2.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 1; *Ri*k S. X, 45, 8\] 'Looking like <span
id="fr_518"></span>[2](#fn_516.md) a golden disk he hath shone far and
wide,'--for that gold plate, being seen, indeed shines far and
wide;--'flashing forth unquenchable <span
id="fr_519"></span>[3](#fn_517.md) life for glory,'--for not easily dying
is his (Agni's) life (vital power); and for glory he does shine;--'Agni
became immortal by his powers, when Dyaus bore him--,' for Dyaus (the
sky) did bear him;--'she that hath good seed--,' for good seed indeed
she has whose seed he (Agni) is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:3">6:7:2:3</span></span>3. He
then takes hold of him by means of the two pads, with (Vâ*g*. S. XII,
2 <span id="fr_520"></span>[4](#fn_518).md), 'Night and Dawn,

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

of one mind, unlike in form,'--night and dawn, doubtless, are day and
night, (and they are) of one mind <span id="fr_521"></span>[1](#fn_519.md),
and unlike in form;--'nourish one child, combining together,'--whatever
belongs to the day and the night, therewith they, combining together,
indeed nourish him (Agni);--'a golden disk, he shineth between heaven
and earth,'--whilst taking it (the fire), he mutters this prayer; for
heaven and earth are those two, the sky and the earth; and moving
between these two he shines: that is why, in taking it, he mutters this
prayer;--'the wealth-giving gods kept Agni;'--therewith, having taken
hold of it in both hands, he sets it down; for the wealth-giving gods
are the vital airs, and they indeed kept up Agni at first: by means of
them he now keeps him up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:4">6:7:2:4</span></span>4. He
then puts round his (neck) the sling of the netting, with (Vâ*g*. S.
XII, 3; *Ri*k S. V, 81, 2), 'The wise putteth on all forms,'--the wise
one, doubtless, is yonder sun, and the netting is all forms;--'he hath
brought forth what is good for the two-footed and four-footed,'--for in
rising he does bring forth what is good for the two-footed and
four-footed;--'the adorable Savit*ri* hath glanced over the
firmament,'--the firmament, doubtless, is the heaven, and even in rising
he looks along it;--'he flasheth forth after the starting <span
id="fr_522"></span>[2](#fn_520.md) of the Dawn,'--for the Dawn shines forth
first, and after her shining forth he (the sun) follows, flashing forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:5">6:7:2:5</span></span>5. By
means of the fashioning (formula) he then fashions him out of that
(matter): he thereby

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

fashions that infused seed, whence the seed infused into the womb is
fashioned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:6">6:7:2:6</span></span>6.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 4\] 'A well-winged bird thou art!'--the well-winged
bird means vigour: he thus forms him so as to be (endowed with)
vigour;--'the Triv*ri*t is thy head,'--he thus makes the Triv*ri*t stoma
(nine-versed hymn) his head;--'the Gâyatra thine eye,'--he thus makes
the Gâyatrî metre his eye;--'the B*ri*hat and Rathantara thy wings,'--he
thus makes the B*ri*hat and Rathantara (hymn-tunes) his wings;--'the
hymn is the self,'--the Pa*ñk*avi*ms*a stoma (twenty-five-versed hymn)
he makes the self (soul, or body);--'the metres the limbs,'--for the
metres are indeed his (Agni's) limbs;--'the prayers his name,'--the
prayers (ya*g*us) are his name 'Agni' by which they call him,--'the
Vâmadevya sâman is thy body,'--the body, doubtless, is the self: thus
'the Vâmadevya (hymn-tune) is thy body, thy self; 'the Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*iya
thy tail,'--he thus makes the Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*iya <span
id="fr_523"></span>[1](#fn_521.md) his tail;--'the hearths thy hoofs,'--by
means of the hearths he (Agni) is indeed established in this
world;--'thou art a well-winged bird: go to the heaven! fly to the
light!'--thus having made him a well-winged <span
id="fr_524"></span>[2](#fn_522.md), bird he says, 'Go to the gods! fly to
the heavenly world!

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:7">6:7:2:7</span></span>7. He
fashions him here (in the pan or womb) into (a bird) with wings and
tail; for whatlike the seed is fashioned in the womb, suchlike it is
born; and because he here fashions him as (a bird) with

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

wings and tail, therefore he is hereafter born with wings and tail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:8">6:7:2:8</span></span>8. Now
some, after addressing him by that fashioning (formula), build a
different altar (than of an eagle's shape), either one constructed in
the form of a trough <span id="fr_525"></span>[1](#fn_523.md), or like a
chariot-wheel, or like a kite, or like the front part of a thill, or
like a thill on both sides, or one consisting of a heap of loose
soil <span id="fr_526"></span>[2](#fn_524). Let him not do so, (but.md) in
such wise as one might carve a young one with wings and tail: let him
therefore build it (the fire-altar) in the form of an eagle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:9">6:7:2:9</span></span>9. With
that fashioning (formula) he holds him high up from thence towards
east <span id="fr_527"></span>[3](#fn_525.md); for he, Agni, is yonder sun:
he thus places yonder sun high up from here in the east; and hence
yonder sun is placed high up from here in the east. He holds him up so
as to be beyond the reach of the arms, for he (the sun) is beyond the
reach of the arms from here. He then lowers him, and, having lowered
him, he holds him above the navel: the significance of this has been
explained <span id="fr_528"></span>[4](#fn_526.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:10">6:7:2:10</span></span>10. He
then strides the Vish*n*u-strides <span id="fr_529"></span>[5](#fn_527.md).
For the gods, in the form of Vish*n*u (the sun), then strode through
these worlds; and inasmuch as, in the form of Vish*n*u, they thus
strode, they are called the Vish*n*u-strides: in like manner does the
Sacrificer,

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

in the form of Vish*n*u, now stride through these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:11">6:7:2:11</span></span>11. Now
he who is Vish*n*u is this sacrifice; and he who is this sacrifice is
that same Agni in the ukhâ (fire-pan): into that same (Agni) the gods
changed themselves, and strode through these worlds; and in like manner
the Sacrificer, having changed himself into that same (Agni), strides
through these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:12">6:7:2:12</span></span>12.
Standing with his face towards north-east (he strides); for standing
towards north-east Pra*g*âpati created offspring by means of the
Vish*n*u-strides: in like manner does the Sacrificer now, standing
towards north-east, create offspring by means of the Vish*n*u-strides.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:13">6:7:2:13</span></span>13.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 5\] 'Thou art Vish*n*u's stride,'--for in the form of
Vish*n*u he strides; 'the slayer of foes;'--for he now slays his
foes;--'mount thou the Gâyatrî metre,'--the Gâyatrî metre he does
mount,--'stride along the earth!'--along the earth he indeed strides. He
stretches forward his (right) foot and strides: he raises the fire
upwards, for upwards he ascends.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:14">6:7:2:14</span></span>14.
'Thou art Vish*n*u's stride,'--for in the form of Vish*n*u he
strides;--'the slayer of plotters,'--for he now does slay the
plotters;--'mount thou the Trish*t*ubh metre!'--the Trish*t*ubh metre he
does mount;--'stride along the air!'--along the air he indeed strides.
He stretches forward his foot and strides: he raises the fire (yet
further) upwards, for upwards he ascends.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:15">6:7:2:15</span></span>15.
'Thou art Vish*n*u's stride,'--for in the form of Vish*n*u he
strides;--'the slayer of the evil-minded,'--for he now does slay the
evil-minded;--

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Mount the
*G*agatî metre!'--for the *G*agatî metre he does mount;--'stride along
the sky!'--along the sky he indeed strides. He stretches his foot
forward and strides: he raises the fire (yet further) upwards, for
upwards he ascends.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:2:16">6:7:2:16</span></span>16.
'Thou art Vish*n*u's stride,'--for in the form of Vish*n*u he
strides;--'the slayer of the hostile,'--for he now does slay the
hostile;--'mount thou the Anush*t*ubh metre!'--the Anush*t*ubh metre he
does mount;--'stride along the quarters!'--he looks along the (four)
quarters; he does not stretch forward his foot, thinking, 'Lest I lose
these worlds!'--He raises the fire right up, for he ascends completely
(to the top).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_515"></span>[272:1](sbe4150.htm#fr_517.md) The author now
proceeds to give further particulars regarding the ceremonial details

seq.).

<span id="fn_516"></span>[272:2](sbe4150.htm#fr_518.md) Literally, 'seen'
or appearing (like).'

<span id="fn_517"></span>[272:3](sbe4150.htm#fr_519.md) Rather
'irresistible, difficult to bear (against);' but the author connects
'durmarsha' with 'mar,' to die.

slightly different.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[273:1](sbe4150.htm#fr_521.md) That is to say,
they are allied.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[273:2](sbe4150.htm#fr_522.md) Or, perhaps, after
the precedence (example) of the Dawn.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[274:1](sbe4150.htm#fr_523.md) The ordinary
hymn-tune of the Agnish*t*oma-sâman, the last and characteristic stotra
of the simplest, or Agnish*t*oma Soma-sacrifice.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[274:2](sbe4150.htm#fr_524.md) Or, the bird (or
eagle, supar*n*a) Garutmat.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[275:1](sbe4150.htm#fr_525.md) Sâya*n*a seems to
make this a round vessel,--dro*n*a*h* parima*nd*alanâma-(?
lamâna)rûpa*m* dro*n*am iva *k*îyate drona*k*it.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[275:2](sbe4150.htm#fr_526.md) Samuhya samuhya
purîsha*m* tenaiva kevalena *k*iyata iti samuhyapurîsha*h*, Sây.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[275:3](sbe4150.htm#fr_527.md) As in the case of
the lump of clay, [VI, 4, 3, 10](sbe4139.htm#6:4:3:10.md).

<span id="fn_526"></span>[275:4](sbe4150.htm#fr_528.md) [VI, 7, 1,
8](sbe4149.htm#6:7:1:8.md) seq.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[275:5](sbe4150.htm#fr_529.md) Or the
Vish*n*u-steps, as the term, for a special reason, was translated at [V,
4, 2, 6](sbe4119.htm#5:4:2:6.md).
