### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:1">5:1:5:1</span></span>1. Now
when they run a race, he thereby wins this same (terrestrial) world. And
when the Brahman sings a Sâman on the cart-wheel set up on (a post)
reaching to his navel, he thereby wins the air-world. And when he erects
the sacrificial post, he thereby wins the world of the gods. Hence that
threefold performance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:2">5:1:5:2</span></span>2. The
Brahman mounts a cart-wheel, set up on (a post) as high as his
navel <span id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64), with (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 10),

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'At the impulse
(sava) of the god Savit*ri*, of true impulsion, may I ascend unto the
highest heaven of B*ri*haspati!' thus, if a Brâhma*n*a sacrifices; for
B*ri*haspati is the Brahman (priesthood, or sanctity), and the
Brâhma*n*a is the Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:3">5:1:5:3</span></span>3. And if
a Râ*g*anya sacrifices, (he does so) with, 'At the impulse of the divine
Savit*ri*, of true impulsion, may I ascend unto the highest heaven of
Indra!' for Indra is the Kshatra (nobility, or power), and the Râ*g*anya
is the Kshatra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:4">5:1:5:4</span></span>4. Thrice
he sings the Sâman <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65). Having thrice
sung it, he descends with, 'At the impulse of the divine Savit*ri*, of
true impulsion, I have ascended unto the highest heaven of
B*ri*haspati!'--thus, if a Brâhma*n*a sacrifices, for B*ri*haspati is
the Brahman, and the Brâhma*n*a is the Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:5">5:1:5:5</span></span>5. And if
a Râ*g*anya sacrifices,--with, 'At the impulse of the divine Savit*ri*,
of true impulsion, I have ascended unto the highest heaven of Indra!'
for Indra is the Kshatra, and the Râ*g*anya is the Kshatra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:6">5:1:5:6</span></span>6. They
put up seventeen drums along the edge of the altar, from the Âgnîdhra
backwards (towards

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

the west); for he who offers the Vâ*g*apeya wins Pra*g*âpati; but
Pra*g*âpati is speech, and that doubtless is the supreme speech which is
(the outcome) of seventeen drums: he thus wins the supreme speech, the
supreme Pra*g*âpati. Seventeen there are, because Pra*g*âpati is
seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:7">5:1:5:7</span></span>7. One of
these drums he (the Brahman) beats (while praying) with a sacrificial
formula: thereby all of them become beaten with a sacrificial formula.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:8">5:1:5:8</span></span>8. He
beats it with (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 11), 'O B*ri*haspati, win the race! lift ye
up your voice unto B*ri*haspati: make ye B*ri*haspati win the race!'
thus, if a Brâhma*n*a sacrifices; for B*ri*haspati is the Brahman, and
the Brâhma*n*a is the Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:9">5:1:5:9</span></span>9. And if
a Râ*g*anya sacrifices, (he does so) with, 'O Indra, win the race! lift
ye up your voice unto Indra: make ye Indra win the race!' for Indra is
the Kshatra, and the Râ*g*anya is the Kshatra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:10">5:1:5:10</span></span>10. And
when those race-running chariots <span id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66)
have come up again, he takes down one of those drums with a sacrificial
formula; whereby they all become taken down with a formula.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:11">5:1:5:11</span></span>11. He
takes it down, with (Vâ*g*. S. I X, 12), 'This hath been your true
concord whereby ye (drums) have caused B*ri*haspati to win the
race;--B*ri*haspati ye have caused to win the race: be released, ye
wood-lords!' thus, if a Brâhma*n*a

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

sacrifices; for B*ri*haspati is the Brahman, and the Brâhma*n*a is the
Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:12">5:1:5:12</span></span>12. And
if a Râ*g*anya sacrifices, with, 'This hath been your true concord
whereby ye have caused Indra to twin the race;--Indra ye have caused to
win the race: be released, ye wood-lords!' for Indra is the Kshatra, and
the Râ*g*anya is the Kshatra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:13">5:1:5:13</span></span>13. A
Râ*g*anya then <span id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67) shoots seventeen
arrow's ranges northwards from the edge of the altar; for as much as is
one arrow's range, so much is Pra*g*âpati crosswise; and as much as are
seventeen arrow's ranges, so much is Pra*g*âpati lengthwise.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:14">5:1:5:14</span></span>14. And
as to why a Râ*g*anya shoots,--he, the Râ*g*anya is most manifestly of
Pra*g*âpati (the lord of creatures): hence, while being one, he rules
over many; and because 'pra*g*âpati' has four syllables, and
'râ*g*anya <span id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_68)' also has four syllables,
therefore a Râ*g*anya shoots. He shoots seventeen arrow's ranges,
because Pra*g*âpati is seventeenfold: he thereby wins Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:15">5:1:5:15</span></span>15. And
whichever (horse) he yokes with a formula, up to that the Sacrificer now
steps <span id="fr_69"></span>[3](#fn_69), with (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 13), 'At
the impulse of the divine Savit*ri*,

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

of true impulsion, may I win the race of the race-winning B*ri*haspati!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:16">5:1:5:16</span></span>16. And
even as then B*ri*haspati hasted up to Savit*ri* for his
impulsion,--Savit*ri* being the impeller among the gods--saying, 'Impel
this for me: impelled by thee, may I win this!' and Savit*ri*, as the
impeller, impelled it for him, and impelled by Savit*ri*, he won; in
like manner does he thereby haste up to Savit*ri* for his
impulsion,--Savit*ri* being the impeller among the gods,--saying, 'Impel
this for me: impelled by thee, may I win!' and Savit*ri*, as the
impeller, impels it for him, and impelled by Savit*ri* he wins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:17">5:1:5:17</span></span>17. And
if a pupil of the Adhvaryu's or some (other) theological student were to
know that prayer, stepping up he makes (the Sacrificer) say, 'O
coursers!'--for horses are indeed coursers: therefore he says, 'O
coursers'--'wealth-winners!' for wealth is food: 'food-winners' he
thereby says;--'keeping the roads,' for they indeed run keeping (within)
the roads;--'measuring the stages;' for measuring the stages they run
over the course;--'go ye to the winning-post!' In order that the
evil-doers, the Rakshas, may not hurt them midways, he thus says
this.--They run the race, they beat the drums, and he (the Brahman)
sings the Sâman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:18">5:1:5:18</span></span>18. He
(the Adhvaryu) then <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70) either offers or
addresses (the horses) with those two *g*agatî-verses: whether he
offers, or whether he addresses (the

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

horses), the significance (of the performance) is the same.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:19">5:1:5:19</span></span>19. He
offers, with (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 14; *Ri*k S. IV, 40, 4), 'That courser
speedeth after the whip, fettered at the neck and shoulder and mouth:
may Dadhikrâ win according to his power; may he run along the windings
of the roads, hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:20">5:1:5:20</span></span>20.
\[Vâ*g*. S. IX, 15; *Ri*k S. IV, 40, 3\], 'And of him, the running,
speeding, there fanneth like the wing of the eager bird,--as of the
gliding eagle,--about the breast of Dadhikrâvan passing along with
might, hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:21">5:1:5:21</span></span>21. He
then either offers or addresses (the horses) with the following
tristich: this is twofold, because he either offers or addresses.
Whether he offers, or addresses (the horses), the significance is the
same: he thereby speeds those running horses, imbues them with energy.
There are here three earths, namely this one, and two beyond it: these
he thereby wins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:22">5:1:5:22</span></span>22. He
addresses (the horses, with Vâ*g*. S. IX, 16; *Ri*k S. VII, 38, 7),
'Auspicious be the coursers unto us at the invocations in the divine
service, running their measured course, with beautiful song; swallowing
the dragon, the wolf, the evil spirits: may they ever keep away from us
affliction!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:23">5:1:5:23</span></span>23.
\[Vâ*g*. S. IX, 17; *Ri*k S. X, 64, 6\], 'Those racers, wont to hear the
calls, may they all hear our call, the coursers running their measured
course: they, the winners of thousands, eager to win at the winning of
oblations, who have carried off great gain in the contests.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:24">5:1:5:24</span></span>24.
\[Vâ*g*. S. IX, 18; *Ri*k S. VII, 38, 8\], 'In

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

every race, help us, ye racers, at the prizes, ye wise, immortal knowers
of the divine law: drink of this mead, be gladdened, and satisfied walk
ye on the paths trodden by the gods!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:25">5:1:5:25</span></span>25. He
then <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71) steps over against (the horses)
with the Bârhaspatya pap, and touches it; for he who offers the
Vâ*g*apeya wins food, since 'vâ*g*a-peya' is the same as 'anna-peya:'
whatever food he has thus gained that he now, having reached that goal,
brings in contact with himself, puts within himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:26">5:1:5:26</span></span>26. He
touches it, with (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 19), 'May gain of wealth come to me!'
wealth means food: he thus says, 'May gain of food come (accrue) to
me;'--'May these two, Heaven and Earth, the all-shaped, come to me!' for
Pra*g*âpati is Heaven and Earth;--'May father and mother come to me!'
for Pra*g*âpati is both father and mother;--'May Soma come to me with
immortality!' for Pra*g*âpati is Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:27">5:1:5:27</span></span>27. He
makes the horses smell it, with, 'Ye coursers!' for horses are coursers:
therefore he says, 'Ye coursers! wealth-winners!' wealth is food:
'food-winners' he thereby says;--'having run the course--' for 'starting
(upon the course)' he said before, as then they were indeed starting;
but now he says, 'having run,' for they indeed have run (the race):
therefore he says, 'having run;'--'smell ye B*ri*haspati's portion--'
for this is B*ri*haspati's portion: therefore he says, 'Smell ye
B*ri*haspati's portion;'--'taking (it) in!' whereby. he imbues the
Sacrificer with energy. And as to why

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

he makes the horses smell,--he made them smell before, thinking, 'May I
win this (world);' and now (he does so) thinking, 'I have won this
(world) that is why he makes the horses smell.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:5:28">5:1:5:28</span></span>28. Now
on one of those race-running (rival) chariots there has been standing
either a Vai*s*ya, or a Râ*g*anya; he now sits down on the northern hip
of the altar. Thereupon the Adhvaryu and Sacrificer, taking the
honey-cup, step out by the front, door (of the cart-shed), and place it
in the Vai*s*ya's, or Râ*g*anya's, hand. And the Nesh*tri*, taking the
cups of Surâ, steps out by the back door. He walks round by the back of
the hall, and placing one (of the cups) in the Vai*s*ya's, or
Râ*g*anya's, hand, he says, 'With this I buy Him of thee!' For the Soma
is truth, prosperity, light; and the Surâ is untruth, misery, darkness:
he thus imbues the Sacrificer with truth, prosperity, and light; and
smites the Vai*s*ya with untruth, misery, and darkness;--whatever
benefit (or enjoyment) he desires, he obtains for himself by those (cups
of Surâ). But that cup of honey he presents to the Brahman, together
with the golden vessel. In presenting it to the Brahman, he imbues
himself with immortal life; for gold is immortal life;--and whatsoever
benefit he desires that he thereby obtains for himself.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_64"></span>[22:2](sbe4107.htm#fr_64) According to the
Taittirîya ritualists, as quoted by Sâya*n*a (Taitt. S. I, 7, 8), the
wheel after being mounted by the Brahman is to be turned round thrice in
a sunwise motion;--the (pointed) end of the post being apparently
inserted in the navel of the wheel, lying horizontally upon it. The
turning wheel is there compared with the Va*g*ra, or disk-shaped
thunderbolt. While the wheel is turning round its axle, the Brahman
sings the Sâman. Cf. also Lâ*t*y. *S*r. V, 12, 9 seq., according to
which authority, however, the Brahman <span id="page_23">p. 23</span>
would seem only to put his arms on the wheel, and turn it round, while
singing.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[23:1](sbe4107.htm#fr_65) Viz. the 'vâ*g*inâ*m*
sâman' (Tâ*nd*y. Br. 18; 7, 12), Sâmav. I, 435 'àvir maryâ â vâ*g*am
vâ*g*ino agman,' &c. 'The fiery steeds have gathered fiery mettle, the
impulse of the god Savit*ri*; win ye the heaven, O coursers!' Lâ*t*y.
*S*r. V, 12, 14. This singing of the Sâman takes place while the race
lasts, the Brahman remaining all the time on the cart-wheel put up on a
short post on (or near) the utkara, or heap of rubbish.--The author then
anticipates in this and the next two paragraphs what the Brahman is to
do when he descends from the wheel after the race is over. The placing
of the drums next referred to must also be imagined as taking place
whilst the Brahman is mounting the wheel.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[24:1](sbe4107.htm#fr_66) Besides the
Sacrificer's chariot inside the vedi, sixteen others, each drawn by four
horses, have been got ready, outside the vedi, for the race to the
udumbara branch, as its goal and turning-point. In paragraphs
[10](sbe4107.htm#5:1:5:10)-[12](sbe4107.htm#5:1:5:12) the author again
anticipates what is to be done with the drums after the race has taken
place, just in order to deal with that item of the ceremonial as a
whole.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[25:1](sbe4107.htm#fr_67) That is, after (or at
the same time when) the drums are put up. He is to shoot northwards
through the space between the utkara and *k*âtvâla. At the end of the
seventeenth arrow's range he plants an udumbara branch in the ground to
serve as the goal round which the chariots are to turn sunwise on their
way back to the sacrificial ground.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[25:2](sbe4107.htm#fr_68) Pronounce
'râ-*g*a-ní-a.'

<span id="fn_69"></span>[25:3](sbe4107.htm#fr_69) In the Taittirîya
ritual (Taitt. S. I, 7, 7, 2; Taitt. Br. I, 3, 5, 4) the Sacrificer
steps up to the chariot with the three Vish*n*u-strides, with
appropriate formulas.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[26:1](sbe4107.htm#fr_70) That is, he does so
whilst the cars are running; the offering or prayers being intended to
make the Sacrificer's car win the race.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[28:1](sbe4107.htm#fr_71) That is, after the
cars have come back, that of the Sacrificer keeping ahead of the others.
