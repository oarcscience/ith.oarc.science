### INTRODUCTION.

THE first of the three Kâ*nd*as contained in the present volume
continues the dogmatic discussion of the different forms of
Soma-sacrifice, in connection with which two important ceremonies, the
Vâ*g*apeya and Râ*g*asûya, are considered. From a ritualistic point of
view, there is a radical difference between these two ceremonies. The
Râ*g*asûya, or 'inauguration of a king,' strictly speaking, is not a
Soma-sacrifice, but rather a complex religious ceremony which includes,
amongst other rites, the performance of a number of Soma-sacrifices of
different kinds. The Vâ*g*apeya, or 'drink of strength' (or, perhaps,
'the race-cup'), on the other hand, is recognised as one of the
different forms (sa*m*sthâ) which a single Soma-sacrifice may take. As a
matter of fact, however, this form hardly ever occurs, as most of the
others constantly do, in connection with, and as a constituent element
of, other ceremonies, but is almost exclusively performed as an
independent sacrifice. The reason why this sacrifice has received a
special treatment in the Brâhma*n*a, between the Agnish*t*oma and the
Râ*g*asûya, doubtless is that, unlike the other forms of Soma-sacrifice,
it has some striking features of its own which stamp it, like the
Râ*g*asûya, as a political ceremony. According to certain ritualistic
authorities <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md), indeed, the performance
of the Vâ*g*apeya should be arranged in much the same way as that of the
Râ*g*asûya; that is, just as the central ceremony of the Râ*g*asûya,
viz. the Abhishe*k*anîya or consecration, is preceded and followed by
certain other Soma-days, so the Vâ*g*apeya should be preceded and
followed by exactly corresponding ceremonies.

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

The preceding Kâ*nd*a was chiefly taken up with a detailed discussion of
the simplest form of a complete Soma-sacrifice, the Agnish*t*oma,
serving as the model for all other kinds of one-day (ekâha)
Soma-sacrifices; and it also adverted incidentally to some of the
special features of such of the remaining fundamental forms of
Soma-sacrifice as are required for the performance of sacrificial
periods of from two to twelve pressing-days--the so-called
ahîna-sacrifices--as well as for the performance of the sacrificial
sessions (sattra) lasting from twelve days upwards. As the discussion of
the Vâ*g*apeya presupposes a knowledge of several of those fundamental
forms of Soma-sacrifice, it may not be out of place here briefly to
recapitulate their characteristic features.

The ekâha, or 'one-day' sacrifices, arc those Soma-sacrifices which have
a single pressing-day, consisting of three services (or pressings,
savana)--the morning, midday, and third (or evening) services--at each
of which certain cups of Soma-liquor are drawn, destined to be
ultimately consumed by the priests and sacrificer, after libations to
the respective deities have been duly made therefrom. At certain stated
times during the performance, hymns (stotra) are chanted by the
Udgât*ri*s; each of which is followed by an appropriate recitation
(*s*astra) of Vedic hymns or detached verses, by the Hot*ri* priest or
one of his assistants. An integral part of each Soma-sacrifice,
moreover, is the animal sacrifice (pa*s*ubandhu); the number of victims
varying according to the particular form of sacrifice adopted. In the
exposition of the Agnish*t*oma, the animal offering actually described
(part ii, p. 162, seq.) is that of a he-goat to Agni and Soma, intended
to serve as the model for all other animal sacrifices. This description
is inserted in the Brâhma*n*a among the ceremonies of [the day preceding
the Soma-day, the animal offering to Agni-Soma being indeed a constant
feature of that day's proceedings at every Soma-sacrifice; whilst the
slaughter of the special victim, or victims, of the respective sacrifice
takes place during the morning service](errata.htm#0.md), and the
meat-oblations are made during the evening service of the pressing-day.
The ritualistic works enumerate a considerable number of 'one-day'
sacrifices, all of them with special features of their

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

own; most of these sacrifices are, however, merely modifications of one
or other of the fundamental forms of ekâhas. Of such forms or
sa*m*sthâs--literally, 'completions,' being so called because the final
chants or ceremonies are their most characteristic features--the ritual
system recognises seven, viz. the Agnish*t*oma. Atyagnish*t*oma. Ukthya,
Sho*d*a*s*in, Vâ*g*apeya <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md), Atirâtra,
and Aptoryâma.

The Agnish*t*oma, the simplest and most common form of Soma-sacrifice,
requires the immolation of a single victim, a he-goat to Agni; and the
chanting of twelve stotras, viz. the Bahish-pavamâna and four
Â*g*ya-stotras at the morning service; the Mâdhyandina-pavamâna and four
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras at the midday service; and the T*ri*tîya (or
Ârbhava)-pavamâna and the Agnish*t*oma-sâman at the evening service. It
is this last-named chant, then, that gives its name to this sacrifice
which, indeed, is often explained as the 'Agnish*t*oma-sa*m*stha*h*
kratu*h* <span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md),' or the sacrifice concluding
with 'Agni's praise.' The term 'sâman,' in its narrow technical sense,
means a choral melody, a hymn-tune, without reference to the words set
thereto. Not unfrequently, however, it has to be taken in the wider
sense of a chanted verse or hymn (triplet), a chorale; but, though the
distinction is evidently of some importance for the ritual, it is not
always easy to determine the particular sense in which the term is meant
to be applied, viz. whether a specified sâman is intended to include the
original text set to the respective tune, or whether some other verses
to which that tune has been adapted are intended. In the case of the
Agnish*t*oma-sâman, however, the word 'sâman' cannot be taken in its
narrow acceptation, but the term has to be understood in the sense of 'a
hymn chanted in praise of Agni.' The words commonly used for this chant,
are the first two verses of Rig-veda S. VI, 48, a hymn indeed

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

admirably adapted for the purpose of singing Agni's praises. For the
first verse, beginning 'ya*gñ*â-ya*gñ*â vo agnaye,' the chief tune-book,
the Grâmageya-gâna, has preserved four different tunes, all of which are
ascribed to the *Ri*shi Bharadvâ*g*a: one of them has, however, come to
be generally accepted as the Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*îya-tune κατ᾽ ἐξοχήν, and has
been made use of for this and numerous other triplets <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md); whilst the other tunes seem to have met
with little favour, not one of them being represented in the triplets
arranged for chanting in stotras, as given in the Ûha and Uhya-gânas.
Neither the Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*îya-tune, nor its original text, is however a
fixed item in the chanting of the Agnish*t*oma-sâman. Thus, for the
first two verses of Rig-veda VI, 48, the Vâ*g*apeya-sacrifice <span
id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md) substitutes verses nine and ten of the same
hymn, and these are chanted, not to the Ya*gñ*âya*gñ*îya, but to the
Vâravantîya-tune, originally composed for, and named after, Rig-veda I,
27, 1 (S. V. I, 17; ed. Calc. I, p. 121) 'a*s*va*m* na tvâ vâravantam.'

The Ukthya-sacrifice requires the slaughtering of a second victim, a
he-goat to Indra and Agni; and to the twelve chants of the Agnish*t*oma
it adds three more, the so-called Uktha-stotras, each of which is again
followed by an Uktha-*s*astra recited by one of the Hotrakas, or
assistants of the Hot*ri*. As the evening service of the Agnish*t*oma
had only two *s*astras, both recited by the Hot*ri*, the addition of the
three *s*astras of the Hotrakas would, in this respect, equalize the
evening to the morning and midday savanas. The word 'uktha' is explained
by later lexicographers either as a synonym of 'sâman,' or as a kind of
sâman <span id="fr_5"></span>[3](#fn_5.md); but it is not unlikely that
that meaning of the word was directly derived from this, the most
common, use of the word in the term 'uktha-stotra.' The etymology of the
word <span id="fr_6"></span>[4](#fn_6.md), at all events, would point to
the

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

meaning 'verse, hymn,' rather than to that of 'tune' or 'chant;' but, be
that as it may, the word is certainly used in the former sense in the
term 'mahad-uktha,' the name of the 'great recitation' of a thousand
b*ri*hatî verses <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md), being the Hot*ri*'s
*s*astra in response to the Mahâvrata-stotra at the last but one day of
the Gavâm-ayana. And, besides, at the Agnish*t*oma a special 'ukthya'
cup of Soma-juice is drawn both at the morning and midday pressings, but
not at the evening savana. This cup, which is eventually shared by the
three principal Hotrakas between them, is evidently intended as their
reward for the recitation of their 'ukthas.' At the Ukthya-sacrifice, as
might have been expected, the same cup is likewise drawn at the evening
service. Though it may be taken for granted, therefore, that 'uktha' was
an older term for '*s*astra,' it still seems somewhat strange that this
terns should have been applied specially to the additional *s*astras and
stotras of the Ukthya-sacrifice. Could it be that the name of the
additional Ukthya-cup, as a distinctive feature of this sacrifice,
suggested the name for the *s*astras and stotras with which that cup was
connected, or have we rather to look for some such reason as Ait. Br.
VI, 13 might seem to indicate? This passage contains a discussion
regarding the different status of the Hotrakas who have ukthas of their
own, and those who have not; and it then proceeds to consider the
difference that exists between the two first and the third savanas of
the Agnish*t*oma in respect of the Hotrakas’ ukthas. It is clear that
here also, the term 'uktha' can hardly be taken otherwise than as
referring to

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

the *s*astras--though, no doubt, the stotra is sometimes said to belong
to the priest who recites the *s*astra in response to it--and this
paragraph of the Brâhma*n*a reads almost like the echo of an old
discussion as to whether or not there should be recitations for the
Hotrakas at the evening service of a complete Soma-sacrifice. If, in
this way, the question of uktha or no uktha had become a sort of
catchword for ritualistic controversy, one could understand how the term
came ultimately to be applied to the three additional stotras and
*s*astras.

Not unfrequently, the Ukthya is treated merely as a redundant
Agnish*t*oma, as an 'Agnish*t*oma*h* soktha*h*,' or Agnish*t*oma with
the Ukthas <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md). Considering, however, that
the term Agnish*t*oma, properly speaking, belongs only to a
Soma-sacrifice which ends with the Agnish*t*oma (sâman), and that the
addition of the Uktha-stotras also involves considerable modifications
in the form of most of the preceding chants, a new term such as Ukthya,
based on the completing and characteristic chants of this form of
sacrifice, was decidedly more convenient. In regard to the composition
of the preceding stotras, with the exception of the Mâdhyandina-pavamâna
and the Agnish*t*oma-sâman, the Ukthya, indeed, may be said to
constitute a parallel form of Sacrifice beside the Agnish*t*oma <span
id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9.md), the succeeding sa*m*sthâs following the
model of either the one or the other of these two parallel forms.

The Sho*d*a*s*in-sacrifice requires, as a third victim, the

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

immolation of a ram to Indra; and one additional chant, the
sho*d*a*s*i-stotra, with its attendant *s*astra and Soma-cup. The most
natural explanation of the name is the one supplied, in the first place,
by Ait. Br. IV, 1 (as interpreted by Sâya*n*a)--viz. the sacrifice which
has sixteen, or a sixteenth, stotra <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md).
But, as the name applies not only to the sacrifice but also to the
stotra and *s*astra, the Brâhma*n*a further justifies the name by the
peculiar composition of the sho*d*a*s*i-*s*astra in which the number
sixteen prevails <span id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md). Very probably,
however, the name may have belonged to the sacrifice long before the
*s*astra, for symbolic reasons, had assumed the peculiar form it now
presents.

In this summary of the characteristic features of the forms of
Soma-sacrifice presupposed by the Vâ*g*apeya, no mention has yet been
made of the Atyagnish*t*oma, or redundant Agnish*t*oma, which usually
occupies the second place in the list of sa*m*sthâs. This form of
sacrifice is indeed very little used, and there can be little doubt that
it was introduced into the system, as Professor Weber suggests, merely
for the sake of bringing up the Soma-sa*m*sthâs to the sacred number of
seven. This sacrifice is obtained by the addition of the
sho*d*a*s*i-stotra to the twelve chants of the Agnish*t*oma, as well as
of the special Soma-cup and sacrificial victim for Indra, connected with
that chant. It may thus be considered as a short form of the
Sho*d*a*s*in-sacrifice (though without the full complement of stotras
implied in that name), which might have suited the views of such
ritualists as held the *s*astras of the Hotrakas at the evening service
to be superfluous <span id="fr_12"></span>[3](#fn_12.md).

The distinctive feature of the Atirâtra-sacrifice, as the name itself
indicates, is an 'overnight' performance of chants and recitations,
consisting of three rounds of four stotras and *s*astras each. At the
end of each round

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (paryâya)
libations are offered, followed by the inevitable potations of
Soma-liquor. That the performance, indeed, partook largely of the
character of a regular nocturnal carousal, may be gathered from the
fact, specially mentioned in the Aitareya Brâhma*n*a, that each of the
Hot*ri*'s offering-formulas is to contain the three words--'andhas,'
Soma-plant (or liquor), 'pâ,' to drink, and 'mada,' intoxication.
Accordingly, one of the formulas used is Rig-veda II, 19, 1 apâyy
asyâ<sup>ऽ</sup>ndhaso madâya, 'there has been drunk (by Indra, or by
us) of this juice for intoxication.' The twelve stotras, each of which
is chanted to a different tune, are followed up, at daybreak, by the
Sandhi-stotra, or twilight-chant, consisting of six verses (Sâma-veda S.
II, 99-104) chanted to the Rathantara-tune. This chant is succeeded by
the Hot*ri*'s recitation of the Â*s*vina-*s*astra, a modification of the
ordinary 'prâtar-anuvâka,' or morning-litany, by which the pressing-day
of a Soma-sacrifice is ushered in <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md).
The Atirâtra also requires a special victim, viz. a he-goat offered to
Sarasvatî, the goddess of speech. As regards the ceremonies preceding
the night-performance, there is again a difference of opinion among
ritualists as to whether the sho*d*a*s*i-stotra, with its attendant
rites, is, or is not, a necessary element of the Atirâtra <span
id="fr_14"></span>[2](#fn_14.md). Some authorities <span
id="fr_15"></span>[3](#fn_15.md), accordingly, distinctly recognise two
different kinds of Atirâtra,--one with, and the other without, the
sho*d*a*s*in. In Kâtyâyana's Sûtra, there is no allusion to any
difference of opinion on this point, but, in specifying the victims
required at the different Soma-sacrifices, he merely remarks (IX, 8, 5)
that, 'At the Atirâtra there is a fourth victim to Sarasvatî.' This
would certainly seem to imply that there are also to be the three
preceding victims, including the one to Indra peculiar to the
Sho*d*a*s*in. Â*s*valâyana (V, 11, 1) also refers incidentally to the
sho*d*a*s*in as part of the

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Atirâtra, though
it is not quite clear from the text of the sûtra whether it is meant to
be a necessary or only an optional feature of that sacrifice. The
Aitareya [Brâhma*n*a](errata.htm#1) (IV, 6.md), on the other hand, in
treating of the Atirâtra, enters on a discussion with the view of
showing that the night-performance of that sacrifice is in every respect
equal to the preceding day-performance; and accordingly, as the three
services of the day-performance include fifteen chants and recitations
(viz. the twelve of the Agnish*t*oma, and the three Ukthas), so, during
the night, the three rounds of in all twelve stotras, together with the
sandhi-stotra, here counted as three stotras (triplets), make up the
requisite fifteen chants. This Brâhma*n*a, then, does not recognise the
sho*d*a*s*in as part of the Atirâtra, and, indeed, the manuals of the
Atirâtra chants which I have consulted make no mention of the
sho*d*a*s*i-stotra, though it is distinctly mentioned there among the
chants of the Vâ*g*apeya and the Aptoryâma. The passage in the Aitareya,
just referred to, also seems to raise the question as to whether the
Atirâtra is really an ekâha, or whether it is not rather an
ahîna-sacrifice. On this point also the authorities seem to differ;
whilst most writers take the Atirâtra. and the analogous Aptoryâma, to
be 'one-day' sacrifices, the Tâ*nd*ya Brâhma*n*a (XX) and Lâ*t*y. IX, 5,
6 class them along with the Ahînas <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md);
and they may indeed be regarded as intermediate links between the two
classes of Soma-sacrifice, inasmuch as, in a continued sacrificial
performance, the final recitations of these sacrifices take the place of
the opening ceremony of the next day's performance. Such, for instance,
is the case in the performance of the Atirâtra as the opening day of the
Dvâda*s*âha, or twelve days’ period of sacrifice; whilst in the
performance of the twelfth and concluding day, which is likewise an
Atirâtra, the concluding ceremonies of the latter might be considered in

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

a manner superabundant. It is probably in this sense that Lâ*t*y. (IX,
5, 4) calls the overnight performance of the last day of an ahîna (e. g.
the Dvâda*s*âha) the ya*gñ*apu*kkh*a, or tail of the sacrifice, which is
to fall beyond the month for which, from the time of the initiation, the
ahîna is to last.

The Aptoryâma-sacrifice represents an amplified form of the Atirâtra. It
requires the sho*d*a*s*i-stotra and the ceremonies connected with it as
a necessary element of its performance; whilst its distinctive feature
consists in four additional (atirikta-) stotras and *s*astras, chanted
and recited after the Â*s*vina-*s*astra, the concluding recitation of
the Atirâtra. These four chants are arranged in such a manner that each
successive stotra is chanted to a different tune, and in a more advanced
form of composition, from the triv*ri*t (nine-versed) up to the
ekavi*ms*a (twenty-one-versed) stoma. In the liturgical manuals, the
Aptoryâma, moreover, performs the function of serving as the model for a
sacrificial performance with all the 'p*ri*sh*th*as <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md).' Though this mode of chanting has been
repeatedly referred to in the translation and notes, a few additional
remarks on this subject may not be out of place here. When performed in
its 'p*ri*sh*th*a' form, the stotra is so arranged that a certain sâman
(or chanted triplet) is enclosed, as the 'garbha' (embryo), within some
other sâman which, as its 'p*ri*sh*th*a' (i.e. back, or flanks), is
chanted a number of times before and after the verses of the central
sâman. The tunes most commonly used for forming the enclosing sâmans of
a P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra are the Rathantara and B*ri*hat; and along with
these, four others are singled out to make up the six
P*ri*sh*th*a-sâmans κατ᾽ ἐξοχήν, viz. the Vairûpa (with the text
Sâma-veda II, 212-13), Vairâ*g*a (II, 277-9), *S*âkvara <span
id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md) (chanted on the Mahânâmnî verses,

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aitar. Âr. IV),
and Raivata <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) sâmans., These six
sâmans are employed during the six days’ sacrificial period called
P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha, in such a way that one of them, in the order in
which they are here enumerated, is used for the first, or Hot*ri*'s,
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra on the successive days of that period. In that case,
however, these stotras are not performed in the proper 'p*ri*sh*th*a'
form <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md), i.e. they have no other sâman
inserted within them, but they are treated like any other triplet
according to the particular stoma, or mode of composition, prescribed
for them. But, on the other hand, in the Aptoryâma, when performed 'with
all the P*ri*sh*th*as,' not only are a number of stotras chanted in the
proper 'p*ri*sh*th*a' form, but the 'p*ri*sh*th*a' element asserts
itself in yet another way, viz. by the appearance of all the six
'P*ri*sh*th*a-sâmans' in the course of the performance of the different
stotras, in this way:--the Rathantara-tune forms the middlemost of the
seven triplets of which the Madhyandina-pavamâna is composed;

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

the B*ri*hat forms the 'garbha,' or enclosed sâman, of the
Agnish*t*oma-sâman <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md); the Vairûpa the
garbha of the third, the Vairâ*g*a that of the first, the *S*âkvara that
of the second, and the Raivata that of the fourth, P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra.
It is doubtless this feature which gives to certain Soma-days the name
of 'sarvap*ri*sh*th*a,' or one performed with all the (six)
P*ri*sh*th*as. Then, as regards the particular stotras that are chanted
in the proper 'p*ri*sh*th*a' form, these include not only the four
so-called P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras of the midday service, but also the four
Âgya-stotras of the morning service, as well as the Agnish*t*oma-sâman
and the three Uktha-stotras of the evening service,--in short, all the
first fifteen stotras with the exception of the three Pavamâna-stotras.
Of the stotras which succeed the Ukthas, on the other hand--viz. the
Sho*d*a*s*in, the twelve chants of the three night-rounds, the
Sandhi-stotra, and the four Atirikta-stotras--not one is performed in
the 'p*ri*sh*th*a' form. How often the several verses of the
'p*ri*sh*th*a-sâman,' and those of the 'garbha' are to be chanted, of
course depends, in each case, not only on the particular stoma which has
to be performed, but also on the particular mode (vish*t*uti)
prescribed, or selected, for the stoma. Thus, while all the four
Âgya-stotras are chanted in the pa*ñk*ada*s*a, or fifteen-versed-stoma;
the four P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras are to be performed in the ekavi*ms*a (of
twenty-one verses), the *k*aturvi*ms*a (of twenty-four verses), the
*k*atu*sk*atvâri*ms*a (of forty-four verses), and the
ash*t*â*k*atvâri*ms*a (of forty-eight verses) respectively. Now
whenever, as in the case of the pa*ñk*ada*s*a and the ekavi*ms*a-stomas,
the number of verses is divisible by three, one third of the total
number of verses is usually assigned to each of the three parts of the
stotra, and distributed over the respective (three or sometimes four)
verses of that sâman <span id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_22.md)

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> To illustrate this
tripartite composition, the Hot*ri*'s P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra, performed in
the twenty-one-versed stoma. may be taken as an example. For the
'p*ri*sh*th*a,' the manuals give the B*ri*hat-sâman, on its original
text (Sâma-veda II, 159,160, 'tvâm id dhi havâmahe,' arranged so as to
form three verses), though the Rathantara may be used instead <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md). For the 'garbha,' or enclosed sâman, on
the other hand, the Vairâ*g*a-sâman (with its original text, S. V. II,
277-9, 'pibâ somam indra mandatu tvâ') is to be used, a most elaborate
tune <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md), with long sets of stobhas, or
musical ejaculations, inserted in the text. Of the twenty-one verses, of
which the stoma consists, seven verses would thus fall to the share of
the 'garbha,' and seven verses to that of the p*ri*sh*th*a,' as chanted
before and after the 'garbha.' Thus, in accordance with the formula set
forth in [p. xxii](#page_xxii), note [2](#fn_22.md), the three verses (a,
b, c) of the B*ri*hat would be chanted in the form aaa-bbb-c; then the
verses of the Vairâ*g*a-sâman (as 'garbha') in the form a-bbb-ccc; and
finally again the B*ri*hat in the form aaa-b-ccc. Stotras, the total
number of verses of which is not divisible by three, of course require a
slightly different distribution. Thus, of the third P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra,
the stoma of which consists of forty-four verses, the two parts of the
'p*ri*sh*th*a' obtain fifteen verses each, whilst the 'garbha' has only
fourteen verses for its share.

The Vâ*g*apeya, the last of the seven forms of a complete
Soma-sacrifice, occupies an independent position beside the Atirâtra and
Aptoryâma, whose special features it does not share. Like them, it
starts from the Sho*d*a*s*in, to the characteristic (sixteenth) chant
(and recitation) of which it acids one more stotra, the
Vâ*g*apeya-sâman, chanted to the B*ri*hat-tune, in the Saptada*s*a
(seventeen-versed) stoma, and followed by the recitation of the
Vâ*g*apeya-*s*astra. The Saptada*s*a-stoma, indeed, is so characteristic
of this sacrifice that--as has been set forth at [p.
8](sbe4104.htm#page_8.md) note

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

below--all the preceding chants, from the Bahishpavamâna onward, are
remodelled in accordance with it. Besides, over and above the three
victims of the Sho*d*a*s*in-sacrifice, the Vâ*g*apeya requires, not only
a fourth one, sacred to Sarasvatî, the goddess of speech, but also a set
of seventeen victims for Pra*g*âpati, the god of creatures and
procreation. As regards other rites peculiar to the Vâ*g*apeya, the most
interesting, doubtless, is the chariot-race in which the sacrificer, who
must be either of the royal or of the priestly order, is allowed to
carry off the palm, and from which this sacrifice perhaps derives its
name. Professor Hillebrandt <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md), indeed,
would claim for this feature of the sacrifice the character of a relic
of an old national festival, a kind of Indian Olympic games; and though
there is perhaps hardly sufficient evidence to bear out this conjecture,
it cannot at least be denied that this feature has a certain popular
look about it.

Somewhat peculiar are the relations between the Vâ*g*apeya and the
Râ*g*asûya on the one hand, and between the Vâ*g*apeya and the
B*ri*haspatisava on the other. In the first chapter of the fifth book,
the author of this part of our Brâhma*n*a is at some pains to impress
the fact that the Vâ*g*apeya is a ceremony of superior value and import
to the Râ*g*asûya; and hence Kâtyâyana (XV, 1, 1-2) has two rules to the
effect that the Râ*g*asûya may be performed by a king who has not yet
performed the Vâ*g*apeya. These authorities would thus seem to consider
the drinking of the Vâ*g*apeya-cup a more than sufficient equivalent for
the Râ*g*asûya, or inauguration of a king; they do not, however, say
that the Râ*g*asûya must be performed prior to the Vâ*g*apeya, but only
maintain that the Vâ*g*apeya cannot be performed after the Râ*g*asûya.
The Râ*g*asûya, according to the Brâhma*n*a, confers on the sacrificer
royal dignity (râ*g*ya), and the Vâ*g*apeya paramount sovereignty
(sâmrâ*g*ya). It might almost seem as if the relatively loose positions
here assigned to the Râ*g*asûya were entirely owing to the fact that it
is a purely Kshatriya ceremony to which the

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brâhma*n*a has no
right, whilst the Vâ*g*apeya may be performed by Brâhma*n*as as well as
Kshatriyas. But on whatever grounds this appreciation of the two
ceremonies may be based, it certainly goes right in the face of the rule
laid down by Â*s*valâyana (IX, 9, 19) that, 'after performing the
Vâ*g*apeya, a king may perform the Râ*g*asûya, and a Brâhma*n*a the
B*ri*haspatisava.' With this rule would seem to accord the relative
value assigned to the two ceremonies in the Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ (V, 6,
2, 1) and Brâhma*n*a (II, 7, 6, 1), according to which the Vâ*g*apeya is
a 'samrâ*t*sava,' or consecration to the dignity of a paramount
sovereign, while the Râ*g*asûya is called a 'varu*n*asava,' i.e.,
according to Sâya*n*a, a consecration to the universal sway wielded by
Varu*n*a <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md). In much the same sense we
have doubtless to understand the rule in which Lâ*t*yâyana defines the
object of the Vâ*g*apeya (VIII, 11, 1), viz. 'Whomsoever the Brâhma*n*as
and kings (or nobles) may place at their head, let him perform the
Vâ*g*apeya.' All these authorities, with the exception of the
*S*atapatha-Brâhma*n*a and Kâtyâyana, are thus agreed in making the
Vâ*g*apeya a preliminary ceremony, performed by a Brâhma*n*a who is
raised to the dignity of a Purohita, or head-priest (so to speak, a
minister of worship, and court-priest), or by a king who is elected
paramount sovereign by a number of petty râ*g*as; this sacrifice being
in due time followed by the respective installation and consecration
ceremony, viz. the B*ri*haspatisava, in the case of the Purohita; and
the Râ*g*asûya, in that of the king. In regard to the B*ri*haspatisava,
which these authorities place on an equality with the Râ*g*asûya, our
Brâhma*n*a finds itself in a somewhat awkward position, and it gets out
of its difficulty (V, 2, 1, 19) by simply identifying the
B*ri*haspatisava with the Vâ*g*apeya, and making the Vâ*g*apeya itself
to be 'the consecration of B*ri*haspati;' and Kâtyâyana (XIV, 1, 2)
compromises matters by combining the two ceremonies in this way that he
who performs the Vâ*g*apeya is to perform the B*ri*haspatisava for a
fortnight before and after the Vâ*g*apeya.

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

The Râ*g*asûya, or inauguration of a king, is a complex ceremony which,
according to the *S*rauta-sûtras, consists of a long succession of
sacrificial performances, spread over a period of upwards of two years.
It includes seven distinct Soma-sacrifices, viz. 1, the Pavitra, an
Agnish*t*oma serving as the opening sacrifice, and followed, after an
interval of a year (during which the seasonal sacrifices have to be
performed), by 2, the Abhishe*k*anîya, an Ukthya-sacrifice, being the
consecration (or anointing) ceremony. Then follows 3, the Da*s*apeya, or
'drink of ten,' an Agnish*t*oma, so-called because ten priests take part
in drinking the Soma-liquor contained in each of the ten cups. After
another year's interval <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md), during
which monthly 'offerings to the beams (i.e. the months)' are made, takes
place 4, the Ke*s*avapanîya, or hair-cutting ceremony, an
Atirâtra-sacrifice; followed, after a month or fortnight, by d, and 6,
the Vyush*t*i-dvirâtra, or two nights’ ceremony of the dawning,
consisting of an Agnish*t*oma and an Atirâtra and finally 7, the
Kshatra-dh*ri*ti, or 'the wielding of the (royal) power,' an
Agnish*t*oma performed a month later. The round of ceremonies concludes
with the Sautrâma*n*î, an ish*t*i the object of which is to make amends
for any excess committed in the consumption of Soma-liquor.

The fifth book completes the dogmatic discussion of the ordinary circle
of sacrifices, some less common, or altogether obsolete, ceremonies,
such as the A*s*vamedha (horse-sacrifice), Purushamedha (human
sacrifice), Sarvamedha (sacrifice for universal rule), being dealt with,
by way of supplement, in the thirteenth book.

With the sixth Kâ*nd*a, we enter on the detailed explanation of the
Agni*k*ayana, or building of the fire-altar, a very solemn ceremony
which would seem originally to have stood apart from, if not in actual
opposition to, the ordinary sacrificial system, but which, in the end.
apparently by some ecclesiastical compromise, was added

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

on to the Soma ritual as an important, though not indispensable, element
of it. The avowed object of this ceremony is the super-exaltation of
Agni, the Fire, who, in the elaborate cosmogenic legend with which this
section begins, is identified with Pra*g*âpati, the lord of Generation,
and the source of life in the world. As the present volume contains,
however, only a portion of the Agni*k*ayana ritual, any further remarks
on this subject may be reserved for a future occasion.

Since the time when this volume went to press, the literature of the
Soma myth has been enriched by the appearance of an important book, the
first volume of Professor A. Hillebrandt's Vedische Mythologie, dealing
with Soma and cognate gods. As it is impossible for me here to enter
into a detailed discussion of the numerous points raised in the work, I
must content myself for the present with the remark that I believe
Professor Hillebrandt to have fully established the main point of his
position, viz. the identity of Soma with the Moon in early Vedic
mythology.

Lâ*t*y. Sr. VIII, 11, 7-11.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[xiii:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_1.md) In this enumeration
the Vâ*g*apeya is often placed between the Atirâtra and Aptoryâma;
Lâ*t*y. V, 4, 24.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[xiii:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_2.md) Thus on Sat. Br. V, 1,
3, 1 Âgneyam agnish*t*oma âlabhate, Sâya*n*a remarks, 'agni*h*
stûyate<sup>ऽ</sup>sminn ity agnish*t*omo nâma sâma, tasmin vishayabhûta
âgneyam âlabhate, etena pasunâ<sup>ऽ</sup>smin
vâgapeye<sup>ऽ</sup>gnish*t*omasa*m*stha*m* kratum evânush*th*itavan
bhavati.' In IV, 2, 4, 9 seq., also, the term 'agnish*t*oma' would seem
to apply to the final chant rather than to the whole sacrifice.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[xiv:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_3.md) Each Sâman-tune is
usually chanted thrice, either each time on a special verse of its own,
or so that, by certain repetitions of words, two verses are made to
suffice for the thrice-repeated tune.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[xiv:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_4.md) So also does the
Agnish*t*ut ekâha, cf. Tâ*nd*ya Br. XVII, 7.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[xiv:3](sbe4102.htm#fr_5.md) Sâya*n*a, to Sat. Br.
IV, 3, 3, 2, explains it by 'stotra;' but see IV, 2, 3, 6-9 where it
undoubtedly refers to the recited verses (*rik*), not to the sâman.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[xiv:4](sbe4102.htm#fr_6.md) Viz. from root 'va*k*'
to speak. I cannot see the necessity for taking <span id="page_xv">p.
xv</span> 'b*ri*had va*k*as' in Rig-veda VII, 96, 1 in the technical
sense of B*ri*hat-tune, as is done by Prof. Hillebrandt, in his
interesting essay, 'Die Sonnwendfeste in Alt-Indien,' p. 29, merely
because it is used there in connection with Indra; whilst he himself is
doubtful as to whether it should be taken in the same sense in III, 10,
5 where it occurs in connection with Agni. Though the B*ri*hat-sâman is
no doubt frequently referred to Indra, and the Rathantara to Agni, the
couplets ordinarily chanted to them (Rig-veda VI, 46, 1-2 and VII, 32,
22, 23) are both of them addressed to Indra. Both tunes are, however,
applied to verses addressed to all manner of deities.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[xv:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_7.md) See Catalogue of
Sanskrit MSS. of the India Office, No. 434. In Kaush. Br. XI, 8, 'sadasy
ukthâni *s*asyante,' also, the word has undoubtedly the sense of
*s*astra, or (recited) hymn. In part i, p. 346, note 3 of this
translation read 'great recitation or *s*astra,' instead of 'great
chant.'

<span id="fn_8"></span>[xvi:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_8.md) See, for instance,
Tâ*nd*ya Br. XX, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[xvi:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_9.md) Perhaps the most
characteristic point of difference between these two forms in which the
fundamental stotras are chanted is the first (or Hot*ri*'s)
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra at the midday service. Whilst the Agnish*t*oma here
requires the Rathantara-tune chanted on the text, Sâma-vela S. II, 30,
31; the Ukthya, on the other hand, requires the text, S. V. II, 159,
160, chanted to the B*ri*hat-tune. Professor Hillebrandt, l.c., p. 22,
has, indeed, tried to show that these two tunes play an important part
in early India in connection with the celebration of the solstices. A
similar alternation of sâmans to that of the Hot*ri*'s
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra obtains at the third, or Brâhma*n*â*kkh*a*m*sin's
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra; the Naudhasa-sâman (II, 35, 36) being used at the
Agnish*t*oma, and the *S*yaita-sâman at the Ukthya-sacrifice. As regards
the second (or Maitrâvaru*n*a's) and fourth (or A*kkh*âvâka's)
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras, on the other hand, the same sâman--viz. the
Vâmadevya (II, 32-341 and Kâleya (II, 37, 3S respectively--is used both
at the Agnish*t*oma and Ukthya.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[xvii:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_10.md) This is also the
explanation of the term given by Sâya*n*a in his commentary on Tâ*nd*ya
Br. XII, 13, 1.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[xvii:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_11.md) See this
translation, part ii, p. 402, note 1.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[xvii:3](sbe4102.htm#fr_12.md) See part ii, p. 402,
note 2, where it is stated that the tenth and last day of the
Da*s*arâtra is an Atyagnish*t*oma day, called Avivâkya, i.e. one on
which there should be no dispute or quarrel.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[xviii:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_13.md) See part ii, p. 226
seq. On the present occasion the Prâtur-anuvâka is, however, to consist
of as many verses as, counting their syllables, would make up a thousand
b*ri*hatî-verses (of thirty-six syllables each). The three sections of
the ordinary morning-litany from the body of the Â*s*vina-*s*astra which
concludes, after sunrise, with verses addressed to Sûrya, the sun.

VIII, 1, 16; IX, 5, 23 with commentary.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[xviii:3](sbe4102.htm#fr_15.md) Notably Tâ*nd*ya
Br. XX, 1, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[xix:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_16.md) The Aitareya
Brâhma*n*a (VI, 18) in discussing the so-called sampâta hymns inserted
in continued performances, with the view of establishing a symbolic
connection between the several days, curiously explains the term
'ahîna,' not from 'ahas' day, but as meaning 'not defective, where
nothing is left out' (a-hîna).

<span id="fn_17"></span>[xx:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_17.md) From Â*s*valâyana's
rule (IX, 11, 4), 'If they chant in forming the garbha (i.e. in the
'p*ri*sh*th*a' form), let him (the Hot*ri* or Hotraka) recite in the
same way the stotriyas and anurûpas,' it seems, however, clear that the
Aptoryâma may also be performed without the P*ri*sh*th*as.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[xx:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_18.md) The original text of
the Sâkvara-sâman is stated (by Sâya*n*a on Aitar. Br. IV, 13; Mahîdhara
on Vâ*g*. S. X, 14, &c.) to be Sâma-veda II, 1152-3, 'pro shv asmai
puroratham,' but the Sâma-veda Gânas do not seem to give the tune <span
id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span> with that text, but with the Mahânâmnî
verses (ed. Bibl. Ind. II, p. 371). The Tâ*nd*ya Br. XIII, 4 (and
comm.), gives minute directions as to the particular pâdas of the first
three Mahânâmnî triplets which are singled out as of a *s*âkvara
(potent) nature, and are supposed to form the three stotriyâ verses of
the sâkvara-sâman, consisting of seven, six, and five pâdas
respectively. The a*s*âkvara pâdas are, however, likewise chanted in
their respective places, as is also the additional tenth verse, the five
pâdas of which are treated as mere supplementary (or 'filling in')
matter.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[xxi:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_19.md) That is, the
Vâravantîya-tune adapted to the 'Revatî' verses. The Vâravantîya-tune is
named after its original text, Rig-veda I, 27, 1, 'a*s*va*m* na tvâ
vâravantam' (Sâma-veda, ed. Bibl. Ind. I, p. 121). When used as one of
the P*ri*sh*th*a-sâmans it is not, however, this, its original text,
that is chanted to it, but the verses Rig-veda I, 30, 13-15, 'revatîr
na*h* sadhamâda' (Sâma-veda II, 434-6, ed. vol. iv, p. 56), whence the
tune, as adapted to this, triplet, is usually called Raivata. The
Raivata-sâman, thus, is a signal instance of the use of the term 'sâman'
in the sense of a chanted verse or triplet.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[xxi:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_20.md) The statement, in
part ii, p. 403 note (and repeated in the present part, [p.
6](sbe4104.htm#page_6), note [2](sbe4104.htm#fn_37).md), that, while the
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras of the Abhiplava-sha*d*aha are performed in the
ordinary (Agnish*t*oma) way, the P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha requires their
performance in the proper P*ri*sh*th*a form, is not correct. In both
kinds of sha*d*aha, the P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras are performed in the
ordinary way (viz. in the Agnish*t*oma or Ukthya way, see [p.
4](sbe4103.htm#page_4) note.md); but whilst, in the Abhiplava, the
Rathantara and B*ri*hat sâmans are used for the Hot*ri*'s
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra on alternate days, the P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha
requires a different P*ri*sh*th*a-sâman on each of the six days. The two
kinds of sha*d*ahas also differ entirely in regard to the sequence of
stomas prescribed for the performance of the stotras.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[xxii:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_21.md) Either the
Rathantara or the B*ri*hat also forms the 'p*ri*sh*th*a,' or enclosing
sâman, of the fist P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[xxii:2](sbe4102.htm#fr_22.md) Whenever the stotra
is not performed in the 'p*ri*sh*th*a' form, but consists of a single
sâman or triplet, the repetitions required to make up the number of
verses implied in the respective stoma, are distributed over the three
verses of the sâman in such a way that the whole sâman is chanted
thrice, each time with various repetitions of the single verses. The
usual form in which the <span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span> ekavi*ms*a
is performed may be represented by the formula aaa-bbb-c; a-bbb-ccc;
aaa-b-ccc, making together twenty-one verses.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[xxvi:1](sbe4102.htm#fr_27.md) The Brâhma*n*a (V.

combining the twelve oblations so as to form two sets of six each.
