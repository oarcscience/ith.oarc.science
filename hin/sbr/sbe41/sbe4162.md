### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:1">7:3:2:1</span></span>1. Having
smoothed (the sand) down with the two verses containing (the verb) 'to
grow,' and returned (to the hall) he proceeds with the guest offering.
Having performed the guest offering, he proceeds with the Pravargya and
the Upasad <span id="fr_667"></span>[2](#fn_665.md). Having performed the
Pravargya and the Upasad, they appease that (first) layer on the (red
ox-)skin. And as to why on a skin: for the obtainment of the forms, the
skin being outward form;--on the hairy side: for the obtainment of the
forms, hair being outward form;--on a ruddy (skin): for the obtainment
of all forms, all forms (colours being contained) in the ruddy;--on (the
skin) of an ox: for the obtainment of Agni's forms, the ox being the
same as Agni;--on (the skin spread) with the neck towards the east, for
that (tends) godward.

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:2">7:3:2:2</span></span>2. He
spreads it in front of the Gârhapatya, on the Vedi, with the hairy side
upwards, and the neck towards the east: thereon they appease that layer.
Now he sprinkles (the bricks);--when he sprinkles, he thereby makes it
pure, sacrificially clean;--with clarified butter (he sprinkles), for
that is pure, sacrificially clean; and also with the view of its being
unsurpassed <span id="fr_668"></span>[1](#fn_666.md), for no other
sacrificial food is sprinkled with ghee;--silently (he sprinkles), for
what is (done) silently is undefined, and the undefined is everything:
by means of everything he thus makes it pure, and sacrificially clean;
and also with the view of its being unsurpassed, for no other
sacrificial food is sprinkled silently.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:3">7:3:2:3</span></span>3. And,
again, why he sprinkles,--this (layer of bricks) is sacrificial food,
and as such he bastes it <span id="fr_669"></span>[2](#fn_667.md); for
whatever sacrificial food is buttered, and basted, that is palatable and
sacrificially clean. With ghee (he bastes it), for sacrificial food is
basted with ghee; silently (he does so), for silently sacrificial food
is basted;--by means of stalks of Ku*s*a grass, for these are pure, and
sacrificially clean;--by means of the tops, for the top is sacred to the
gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:4">7:3:2:4</span></span>4. As to
this they say, 'When he sprinkles only the first layer, how does that
whole fire-altar of his come to be sprinkled, how does it come to be led
forward on the skin, and how led forward by the horse <span
id="fr_670"></span>[3](#fn_668)?' Inasmuch as in this (layer.md) he
(symbolically) <span id="fr_671"></span>[4](#fn_669.md) sprinkles the
bricks of all the layers; and

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

thus indeed that whole fire-altar of his comes to be sprinkled, and led
forward on the skin, and led forward by the horse. They lift up this
(first) layer <span id="fr_672"></span>[1](#fn_670.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:5">7:3:2:5</span></span>5. He
(the Adhvaryu) then says (to the Hot*ri*), 'Recite to the fires being
led forward!' For at that time when the gods were setting out to spread
the sacrifice, the Rakshas, the fiends, sought to smite them, saying,
'Ye shall not sacrifice! ye shall not spread the sacrifice!!' Having
made those fires, those bricks, to be sharp-edged thunderbolts, they
hurled these at them, and laid them low thereby; and having laid them
low, they spread that sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:6">7:3:2:6</span></span>6. Now,
what the gods did is done here,--even now those Rakshas are indeed
smitten by the gods themselves; and when he nevertheless does this, it
is because he thinks, 'I must do what the gods did.' And so, having made
those fires, those bricks, to be sharp-edged thunderbolts, he hurls them
at whatever Rakshas, whatever evildoers there may be, and lays them low
thereby; and having laid them low, he spreads the sacrifice in a place
free from danger and devilry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:7">7:3:2:7</span></span>7. And as
to why (he recites) to the fires,--it is because there are here many
fires, to wit, those layers; and as to (his reciting) to them being led
forward (pra-har), it is because he hurls (pra-har) them forward (as
thunderbolts).

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:8">7:3:2:8</span></span>8. Now
some recite (Vâ*g*. S. XII, 50), 'The Agnis Purîshyas, together with
those of the streams,'--a form of starting <span
id="fr_673"></span>[1](#fn_671.md). Let him not do so; let him recite
gâyatrî verses addressed to Agni, and relating to (objects of) desire:
(Vâ*g*. S. XII, 115; *Ri*k S. VIII, II, 7), 'Hither may Vatsa lead thy
mind even from the highest seat, O Agni, with the song desirous of
thee!'--(Vâ*g*. S. XII, 116; *Ri*k S. VIII, 43,18), 'To thee, O Agni,
best of Aṅgiras, all good homesteads have laid themselves out for (the
obtainment of) their desire.'--(Vâ*g*. S. XII, 117), 'Agni, the one
all-ruler, shineth in the beloved homes, the (object of) desire of all
that is and shall be.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:9">7:3:2:9</span></span>9. Verses
addressed to Agni he recites for the obtainment of Agni's forms;--and
such as relate to desire, for the obtainment of his desires;--Gâyatrî
ones,--Agni is Gâyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,
with so much he thus pours him forth as seed;--with three
(verses),--Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his
measure, with so much he thus pours him forth as seed. These (three),
with the (first and last verses) recited thrice, amount to seven,--of
seven layers consists the fire-altar <span
id="fr_674"></span>[2](#fn_672.md), seven seasons are a year, and the year
is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does
this become. He recites in a low voice, for here in the sacrifice seed
is (cast), and seed is cast silently. He (the Hot*ri*) marches reciting
behind (the bricks carried by the attendants); he thus marches,
defending the sacrifice by the metres from behind.

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:10">7:3:2:10</span></span>10. And
in front they lead a white horse. For at that time the gods were afraid
lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should smite them here. They saw that
thunderbolt, even yonder sun; for that horse is yonder sun: having
driven off the Rakshas, the fiends, in front, by that thunderbolt, they
obtained well-being in a place free from danger and devilry. They arrive
at the (site of) the fire-altar; south of the tail (of the altar) they
set down the layer (of bricks); from the north they make the horse step
(on the site of the altar).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:11">7:3:2:11</span></span>11.
They lead it eastward on the left (north) side of the altar, inside the
enclosing-stones, whereby they ward off evil from the eastern region;
then southward, whereby they ward off evil from the south; then
westward, whereby they ward off evil from the western region; then
northward, whereby they ward off evil from the northern region. Having
thus warded off the Rakshas, the fiends, from all the regions, he sets
it (the horse) free towards northeast: the significance of this has been
explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:12">7:3:2:12</span></span>12.
Whilst it goes westward he makes it smell (kiss) that layer (of
bricks);--that horse is yonder sun, and those bricks are the same as all
these creatures (on earth): thus even as he makes (the horse) smell, so
yon sun kisses these creatures <span id="fr_675"></span>[1](#fn_673.md).
And hence, by Pra*g*âpati's power, every one now thinks, 'I am!' And as
to why he makes it smell while going westward, it is because, whilst
going (from east) to west, that (sun) kisses all these creatures.

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:13">7:3:2:13</span></span>13.
And, again, why he makes it smell;--that horse is yonder sun, and those
naturally-perforated (bricks) are these worlds; and even as he makes it
smell, so yonder sun strings these worlds to himself on a thread <span
id="fr_676"></span>[1](#fn_674.md). And as to that thread, the significance
of that (will be explained) further on.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:14">7:3:2:14</span></span>14.
And, again, why he makes it smell; Agni went away from the gods; he
entered the water. The gods said to Pra*g*âpati, 'Go thou in search of
him: to thee, his own father, he will reveal himself.' He became a white
horse, and went in search of him. He found him on a lotus leaf, having
crept forth from the water. He eyed him, and he (Agni) scorched him:
hence the white horse has, as it were, a scorched mouth <span
id="fr_677"></span>[2](#fn_675.md), and indeed is apt to become weak-eyed.
He (Agni) thought he had hit and hurt him, and said to him, 'I grant
thee a boon!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:15">7:3:2:15</span></span>15. He
(Pra*g*âpati) said, 'Whoever shall seek thee in that form (of a white
horse), shall find thee!' And, accordingly, he who seeks him (Agni) in
that form, finds him; and having found him, he then builds him up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:16">7:3:2:16</span></span>16. It
should be a white (horse), for that is a form of him (the sun) who burns
yonder. If he cannot obtain a white one, one that is not white might do;
but a horse it should be. If he cannot obtain a horse, even an ox might
do, for the ox is of Agni's nature, and Agni is the repeller of all
evils.

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:17">7:3:2:17</span></span>17.
Now, then, as to the mounting <span id="fr_678"></span>[1](#fn_676.md) (of
the altar). Now some mount it from the front (east) towards the back, or
from the back towards the front: let him not do so; for that Agni (the
fire-altar) is an animal; and if one mounts an animal (ox) from the
front towards the back, it strikes him with its horns; and if he mounts
it from the back towards the front, it does so with its feet. Let him
mount it only by the middle body <span id="fr_679"></span>[2](#fn_677.md);
for the animal which people mount by the (middle) body, carries them
forward, and does not hurt them. From the left (north) side (he should
mount it), for any animal which people mount they mount from the left
side. By mounting the (body of the) altar from the left side, and
performing the work connected with the Uttara-vedi, he takes hold of
Agni in the (middle) body (or, into himself); and having taken Agni into
his own self, he sings the 'true hymn.' He puts a lotus-leaf on (the
altar): thereof further on.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:18">7:3:2:18</span></span>18. Now
that horse they lead about when evening is closing in; for at that time
the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should there smite
that (Agni, or altar) of theirs. They made that thunderbolt, to wit,
yonder sun, his protector, for that horse is yonder sun; and in like
manner does this one now make that thunderbolt his (Agni's) protector.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:3:2:19">7:3:2:19</span></span>19. He
leads it about towards the setting of the sun; for he (the sun) is
manifestly his protector by day; and the Rakshas are the associates of
the

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

night: for the night he thus makes that thunderbolt his protector. He
leads it about on every side: on every side he thus makes that
thunderbolt his protector. Thrice he leads it about: he thus makes that
thunderbolt his (Agni's) threefold protector. He then lets it loose
towards north-west: the purport of this has been explained. It
afterwards returns (to the sacrificial ground): the purport of this
(will be explained) further on.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[356:4](sbe4162.htm#fr_671.md) According to Kâty.
XVII, 3, 18-19 some ritualists would seem to put the (ya*g*ushmatî)
bricks of all the layers on the skin. . But <span id="page_357">p.
357</span> perhaps this is merely a wrong interpretation of this passage
of the Brâhma*n*a; though the three 'naturally-perforated' bricks are
probably placed together.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[357:1](sbe4162.htm#fr_672.md) The Adhvaryu's
attendants take up the ox-skin with the bricks for the first layer lying
on it.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[359:1](sbe4162.htm#fr_675.md) According to
Sâya*n*a, it is by his rays (identified with the vital airs of living
beings) that the sun kisses (or puts himself in contact with) the
creatures (and animates them); so that every one feels that he is
'labdhâtmaka,' or has obtained 'a self,' or life and being.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[360:1](sbe4162.htm#fr_676.md) That is, he passes
a thread through them (as through pearls), fastened to himself.
Regarding this Thread, or spiritual bond, holding together all sentient
existences of the universe, see XIV, 6, 7, 2 seq.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[360:2](sbe4162.htm#fr_677.md) That is, according
to Sâya*n*a, a reddish mouth.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[361:1](sbe4162.htm#fr_678.md) That is, as to the
way in which the priests and sacrificer are to step on the body of the
altar-site, when coming from outside.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[361:2](sbe4162.htm#fr_679.md) That is to say,
from sideways as in getting on the saddle of a horse.
