<p>over himself with the horn of a black antelope; for that collected essence of the waters wherewith he now anoints him means vigour: 'May this vigour of mine spread through my whole self,' thus he thinks, and therefore he rubs it all over himself.</p>

He then pours the remainders (of the water) together into the Br&acirc;hman's vessel: he thereby makes the Br&acirc;hman an object of respect after the king, whence the Br&acirc;hman is an object of respect after the king.</p>

He then returns to the G&acirc;rhapatya fire, (his son) holding on to him behind, and offers, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S.

And any residue that is left over, he offers in the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhr&icirc;ya; for redundant is that residue, and redundant also is the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhr&icirc;ya,--in the G&acirc;rhapatya they cook the oblations, and in the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya they offer, but that one is redundant: thus he puts the redundant to the redundant. He offers it on the north part (of the hearth), for that is the region of that god (Rudra): hence he offers it on the north</p>

Br. VII, 13-18.--'King Hari<I>s</I><I>k</I>andra, of the race of Ikshv&acirc;ku, being childless, made a vow that if he obtained a son he would sacrifice him to Varu<I>n</I>a. A son was born, who received the name of Rohita, but the father postponed, under various pretexts, the fulfilment of his vow. When at length he resolved to perform the sacrifice, Rohita refused to be the victim, and went out into the forest, where he lived for six years. He then met a poor Br&acirc;hman <I>Ri</I>shi called A<I>g</I>&icirc;garta, who had three sons, and Rohita purchased from A<I>g</I>&icirc;garta, for a hundred cows, the second son, named <I>S</I>una<I>h</I><I>s</I>epha, to be the substitute for himself in the sacrifice. Varu<I>n</I>a approved of the substitute, and the sacrifice was about to be performed, the father receiving another hundred cows for binding his son to the sacrificial post, and a third hundred for agreeing to slaughter him. Suna<I>h</I><I>s</I>epha, however, saved himself by reciting verses in honour of different deities, and was received into the family of Vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;mitra, who was one of the officiating priests.'

According to the ceremonial of the Black Ya<I>g</I>us the offering of the residue takes place at the house (first of the favourite son, according to &Acirc;pastamba, and then) of the queen. Taitt.
