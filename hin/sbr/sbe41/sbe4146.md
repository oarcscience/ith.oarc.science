### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:1">6:6:2:1</span></span>1.
Standing he puts it (the pan) on the fire, for the fire-pan is these
worlds, and these worlds stand, as it were. And, moreover, whilst
standing one is strongest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:2">6:6:2:2</span></span>2.
Standing (with his face) towards north-east, for standing towards
north-east Pra*g*âpati created creatures.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:3">6:6:2:3</span></span>3. And,
again, why (he does so) standing towards north-east;--that (quarter),
the north-east, is the quarter of both gods and men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:4">6:6:2:4</span></span>4. And,
again, why standing towards north-east,--in that quarter is the gate of
the world of heaven, hence it is standing with his face towards
northeast that one offers libations, and standing towards north-east
that one leads up the dakshi*n*âs: it is by the gate that he thus makes
him enter into the world of heaven.

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:5">6:6:2:5</span></span>5.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 68\] 'Break not! Suffer not injury!'--as the text, so
its meaning;--'O mother, bear up bravely!'--for the fire-pan (ukhâ, f.)
is a woman; and 'O mother' is a term for addressing a woman: 'bear up
well, indeed!'--(Thou) and Agni will do this (work)!'--for (the
fire-pan) and Agni will indeed be doing this (sacred work).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:6">6:6:2:6</span></span>6.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 69\] 'Stand firm, divine Earth, for our well-being!' as
the text, so its meaning;--'A divine (âsura) contrivance thou art made
in the wonted manner;'--the vital spirit (asu) is the breath, and this
(are-pan) has indeed been made its contrivance in the wonted
manner;--'May this offering be agreeable to the gods!' he thereby means
those libations which he intends to offer in that fire; and moreover,
that (fire-pan) itself is an offering;--'unharmed rise thou in this
sacrifice!' this he says with the view that it may rise unharmed,
uninjured, in this sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:7">6:6:2:7</span></span>7. With
two (verses) he heats it on the fire,--the Sacrificer is two-footed, and
the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,
by so much he thus heats it (the pan). \[He does so\] with a gâyatrî and
a trish*t*ubh verse,--the Gâyatrî is the vital air, and the Trish*t*ubh
the body; and the animal is as much as the vital air and the body: thus
by as much as the animal (consists of) he puts that (pan) on the fire.
And, again, the Gâyatrî is Agni, and the Trish*t*ubh is Indra; and the
fire relates to Indra and Agni: as great as the fire is, as great as is
its measure, by so much he thus heats it. These two (verses) have seven
feet (viz. three and four respectively),--the fire-altar consists of
seven

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

layers <span id="fr_491"></span>[1](#fn_489); seven seasons are a year,
and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,
so great does this become.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:8">6:6:2:8</span></span>8. When
the fire heats it, then the flame mounts up to it; for the fire-pan is a
female, and the fire is a male: hence when the male heats the female, he
infuses seed into her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:9">6:6:2:9</span></span>9. Now,
if the flame is too long in mounting up, some throw coals on (the pan),
thinking, 'There is fire now on both sides.' But let him not do so; for
the animal is indeed born with bones <span
id="fr_492"></span>[2](#fn_490); but it is not forced in with bones, as
it were, at first; but it is introduced only as seed. Now that flame is
boneless seed: hence the flame alone should mount up to it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:10">6:6:2:10</span></span>10.
When the flame mounts up to it, he places a kindling-stick thereon:
thereby the seed enters it (the fire-pan), and that fire imparts growth
to that seed (in the shape of) this (kindling-stick).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:11">6:6:2:11</span></span>11. It
should be one of k*ri*muka wood. Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of
them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, strove together. The gods, having placed
Agni in front, went up to the Asuras. The Asuras cut off the point of
that flame held forward. It settled down on this earth, and became that
k*ri*muka tree: hence it is sweet, for there is vital essence (in it).
Hence also it is red, for it is a flame, that k*ri*muka

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

tree being the same as this Agni: it is (in the shape of) fire that he
imparts growth to it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:12">6:6:2:12</span></span>12. It
(the kindling-stick) is a span long, for Vish*n*u, as an embryo, was a
span long: he thus imparts to it growth equal to his body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:13">6:6:2:13</span></span>13. It
is soaked in ghee;--the inner membrane of the womb from which Agni was
produced consisted of ghee: hence he now blazes up towards it, for it
(the stick) is his self (body); and hence it (the k*ri*muka) has no
ashes: (Agni) himself now enters into his own self,--to avoid
injury <span id="fr_493"></span>[1](#fn_491), for the inner membrane
does not injure the embryo; and it is from the inner membrane that he
who is born is born: 'When he (Agni) is born, may he be born from the
inner membrane!' thus he thinks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:14">6:6:2:14</span></span>14. He
puts it (the kindling-stick) on, with (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 60; *Ri*k S. II, 7,
6), 'The wood-eating, ghee-drinking,'--that is, he who has wood for his
food, and ghee for his drink,--'the primeval, desirable Hot*ri*,'--that
is, 'the old, desirable Hot*ri*;'--'the wonderful son of power,'--power
is strength: thus, 'the wonderful son of strength.' Standing he puts it
on with the 'Svâhâ:' the meaning of this (will be explained)
hereafter <span id="fr_494"></span>[2](#fn_492).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:15">6:6:2:15</span></span>15. Now
the fire-pan is the body, the reed-grass (fuel) the womb, the hemp the
inner membrane <span id="fr_495"></span>[3](#fn_493),

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

the ghee the outer membrane, and the kindling-stick the embryo.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:2:16">6:6:2:16</span></span>16. The
pan is outside, and the reed-grass (fuel) is inside; for the body is
outside, and the womb inside. The reed-grass is outside, and the hemp
inside; for the womb is outside, and the outer membrane is inside. The
hemp is outside, and the ghee is inside; for the outer membrane is
outside, and the inner membrane is inside. The ghee is outside, and the
kindling-stick is inside; for the inner membrane is outside, and the
embryo is inside. It is from these that he who is born is born, and from
them he thus causes him (Agni) to be born.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_489"></span>[254:1](sbe4146.htm#fr_491) See [p.
249](sbe4145.htm#page_249), note [3](sbe4145.htm#fn_486).

<span id="fn_490"></span>[254:2](sbe4146.htm#fr_492) The fire ultimately
to be placed on the new Gârhapatya hearth ([VII, 1, 1,
1](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:1) seq.)--whence the Âhavanîya on the great
fire-altar has to be kindled--is to be produced in the ukhâ, or pan, as
it were in its womb; but the material (grass and hemp) which has already
been put in the pan, is only to be kindled by the blaze of the fire on
which the pan has been placed, without any burning coals being applied
to the fuel within the pan.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[255:1](sbe4146.htm#fr_493) The dative
'ahi*m*sâyai' again doubtless belongs to the first sentence of the
paragraph ('it is soaked in ghee'), the intervening clauses being
inserted for explanation. For a similar construction, see above, [p.
198](sbe4134.htm#page_198), note [2](sbe4134.htm#fn_407).

<span id="fn_492"></span>[255:2](sbe4146.htm#fr_494) See [VI, 7, 2,
1](sbe4150.htm#6:7:2:1).

<span id="fn_493"></span>[255:3](sbe4146.htm#fr_495) The inverted order
of the words '*s*a*n*â *g*arâyu' is peculiar. It seems to have been
resorted to with the view of keeping together the two pairs of subjects,
'mu*ñg*â*h*-*s*a*n*â*h*' and '*g*arâyu-ulbam.'
