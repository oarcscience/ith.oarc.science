### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:2:1">5:4:2:1</span></span>1. He
(the king) is anointed (sprinkled) whilst standing with his face turned
towards the east. A Brâhman--either the Adhvaryu, or he who is his (the
king's) court chaplain--sprinkles him in front, from behind;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:2:2">5:4:2:2</span></span>2. With
(Vâ*g*. S. X, 17), 'With Soma's glory I sprinkle thee,'--'with vigour'
he thereby says; 'With Agni's glow . . . <span
id="fr_187"></span>[1](#fn_187),'--'with vigour' he thereby says;--'With
Sûrya's splendour . . .,'--'with vigour' he thereby says;--'With Indra's
energy. . .,'--'with vigour' he thereby says;--'Be thou the chieftain of
chiefs!'--'be thou the supreme king of kings' he thereby says;--'Guard
(him) <span id="fr_188"></span>[2](#fn_188) against darts!'--darts
meaning arrows, it is past murder by arrows that he thus guides him:
therefore he says, 'guard him against darts!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:2:3">5:4:2:3</span></span>3.
\[Vâ*g*. S. X, 18\] 'Quicken him, O gods, to

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

be unrivalled!'--he thereby says, 'Quicken him, O gods, so as to be
without an enemy;'--'For great chiefdom, for great lordship!'--in this
there is nothing obscure;--'For man-rule!'--'for the ruling of men' he
thereby says;--'For Indra's lordly sway!'--'for power' he means to say,
when he says, 'for Indra's lordly sway!'--'Him, the son of such and such
(a man), the son of such and such (a woman),'--whatever be his parentage
regarding that he says this;--'of such and such a people'--that is to
say, of the people whose king he is;--'This man, O ye (people), is your
king, Soma is the king of us Brahmans!'--he thereby causes everything
here to be food for him (the king); the Brâhman alone he excepts:
therefore the Brâhman is not to be fed upon, for he has Soma for his
king <span id="fr_189"></span>[1](#fn_189).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:2:4">5:4:2:4</span></span>4. He
(the king) then rubs the sprinkled water

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

over himself with the horn of a black antelope; for that collected
essence of the waters wherewith he now anoints him means vigour: 'May
this vigour of mine spread through my whole self,' thus he thinks, and
therefore he rubs it all over himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:2:5">5:4:2:5</span></span>5. He
rubs it over himself, with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 19), Forth from the back of the
mountain, of the bull,'--even as the mountain stands out here, even as
the bull stands out beyond the cattle, so does he who performs the
Râ*g*asûya stand out beyond everything here, and everything here is
below him: therefore he says, 'Forth from the back of the mountain, of
the bull,'--'The ships keep moving, the self-pouring; they, the upwards
bent, have turned back downwards, flowing after the dragon of the
deep <span id="fr_190"></span>[1](#fn_190).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:2:6">5:4:2:6</span></span>6. He
then makes him step the (three) Vish*n*u-steps within (the extent of)
the tiger's skin, with, 'Vish*n*u's outstepping thou art! Vish*n*u's
outstep thou art! Vish*n*u's step thou art!' Now Vish*n*u's outstepping
(vikrama*n*a), Vish*n*u's outstep (vikrânta), and Vish*n*u's step
(krânta) <span id="fr_191"></span>[2](#fn_191) are these (three) worlds:
thus having ascended these worlds, he is high above everything here, and
everything here is below him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:2:7">5:4:2:7</span></span>7. He
then pours the remainders (of the water) together into the Brâhman's
vessel: he thereby makes the Brâhman an object of respect after the
king, whence the Brâhman is an object of respect after the king.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:2:8">5:4:2:8</span></span>8. And to
him who is his (the king's) dearest son, he hands that vessel, thinking,
'May this son of mine perpetuate this vigour of mine!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:2:9">5:4:2:9</span></span>9. He
then returns to the Gârhapatya fire, (his son) holding on to him behind,
and offers, with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 20), 'O Pra*g*âpati, than thee none other
hath encompassed all these forms: for whatsoever object we sacrifice,
let that accrue unto us!--This one is the father of N.N.!'--him who is
the son, he makes the father, and him who is the father, he makes the
son <span id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_192): he thereby links together the
vigour of both of them.--'N.N. is the father of this one!' him who is
the father, he makes the father, and him who is the son, he makes the
son: after linking together the vigour of these two, he puts it again in
the proper way,--'May we be the lords of riches, hail!'--this is the
blessing of that ceremony a blessing he thereby invokes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:2:10">5:4:2:10</span></span>10. And
any residue that is left over, he offers in the Âgnîdhrîya; for
redundant is that residue, and redundant also is the Âgnîdhrîya,--in the
Gârhapatya they cook the oblations, and in the Âhavanîya they offer, but
that one is redundant: thus he puts the redundant to the redundant. He
offers it on the north part (of the hearth), for that is the region of
that god (Rudra): hence he offers it on the north

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

part. He offers with, 'O Rudra, whatever potent <span
id="fr_193"></span>[1](sbe4120.htm#fn_193), highest name is thine,
therein thou art an offering, thou art a home-offering, hail!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_187"></span>[94:1](sbe4119.htm#fr_187) While the preceding
formula is used by the priest, the present and two succeeding ones (each
with the words '. . . I sprinkle thee; guard him against darts!') are
pronounced by the other three persons specified in [V, 3, 5,
12](sbe4117.htm#5:3:5:12)-[14](sbe4117.htm#5:3:5:14), each sprinkling
the king with the water in his respective vessel.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[94:2](sbe4119.htm#fr_188) Mahîdhara explains:
'O Soma, protect him, the Sacrificer, in overcoming the enemy's
missiles.'

<span id="fn_189"></span>[95:1](sbe4119.htm#fr_189) Either at this
juncture, or after the game at dice, the Hot*ri* recites the legend of
*S*una*hs*epha, as given Ait. Br. VII, 13-18.--'King Hari*sk*andra, of
the race of Ikshvâku, being childless, made a vow that if he obtained a
son he would sacrifice him to Varu*n*a. A son was born, who received the
name of Rohita, but the father postponed, under various pretexts, the
fulfilment of his vow. When at length he resolved to perform the
sacrifice, Rohita refused to be the victim, and went out into the
forest, where he lived for six years. He then met a poor Brâhman *Ri*shi
called A*g*îgarta, who had three sons, and Rohita purchased from
A*g*îgarta, for a hundred cows, the second son, named *S*una*hs*epha, to
be the substitute for himself in the sacrifice. Varu*n*a approved of the
substitute, and the sacrifice was about to be performed, the father
receiving another hundred cows for binding his son to the sacrificial
post, and a third hundred for agreeing to slaughter him. Suna*hs*epha,
however, saved himself by reciting verses in honour of different
deities, and was received into the family of Vi*s*vâmitra, who was one
of the officiating priests.' Dowson, Dict. of Hindu Mythology.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[96:1](sbe4119.htm#fr_190) Ahi Budhnya, the
Πύθων ὄφις of Hellenic mythology (St. Petersburg dict.).

<span id="fn_191"></span>[96:2](sbe4119.htm#fr_191) In the Black Ya*g*us
ritual the three steps are called 'krama, krânta, and vikrânta.'

<span id="fn_192"></span>[97:1](sbe4119.htm#fr_192) By way of
illustration, Mahîdhara explains what would have happened at the
inauguration of king Da*s*aratha (of Ayodhyâ), the father of Râma; viz.
in that case the first formula would run,--'Râma is the father of
Da*s*aratha;' and the second--'Da*s*aratha is the father of Râma.'
According to the ceremonial of the Black Ya*g*us the offering of the
residue takes place at the house (first of the favourite son, according
to Âpastamba, and then) of the queen. Taitt. S., vol. ii, p. 154.
