Now as to why he makes this offering. Of old, everything here was within V<I>ri</I>tra, to wit, the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>, the Ya<I>g</I>us, and the S&acirc;man. Indra wished to hurl the thunderbolt at him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:2">5:5:5:2</A></FONT></span>2. He said to Vish<I>n</I>u, 'I will hurl the thunderbolt at V<I>ri</I>tra, stand thou by me!'--'So be it!' said Vish<I>n</I>u, 'I will stand by thee: hurl it!' Indra aimed the thunderbolt at him. V<I>ri</I>tra was afraid of the raised thunderbolt.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:3">5:5:5:3</A></FONT></span>3. He said, 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Ya<I>g</I>us-formulas. He (Indra) aimed at him a second time.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:4">5:5:5:4</A></FONT></span>4. He said, 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Rik-verses. He aimed at him a third time.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:5">5:5:5:5</A></FONT></span>5. 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the S&acirc;man-hymns (or tunes). Therefore they spread the sacrifice even to this day in the same way with those (three) Vedas, first with the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Ya<I>g</I>us-formulas, then with the <I>Ri</I>k-verses, and then with the S&acirc;man-hymns; for thus he (V<I>ri</I>tra) at that time gave them up to him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:6">5:5:5:6</A></FONT></span>6. And that which had been his (V<I>ri</I>tra's) seat, his retreat, that he shattered, grasping it and tearing it out&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: it became this offering. And because the science (the Veda) that lay in that retreat was, as it were, a threefold (tridh&acirc;tu) one, therefore this is called the Traidh&acirc;tav&icirc; (ish<I>t</I>i).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:7">5:5:5:7</A></FONT></span>7. And as to why the oblation is one for Indra and Vish<I>n</I>u, it is because Indra raised the thunderbolt, and Vish<I>n</I>u stood by him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:8">5:5:5:8</A></FONT></span>8. And why it is (a cake) on twelve potsherds,--there are twelve months in the year, and the offering is of equal measure with the year: therefore it is one of twelve potsherds.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:9">5:5:5:9</A></FONT></span>9. He prepares it of both rice and barley. He first puts on (the fire) a ball of rice, that being a form (symbol) of the Ya<I>g</I>us-formulas; then one of barley, that being a form of the <I>Ri</I>k-verses; then one of rice, that being a form of the S&acirc;man-hymns. Thus this is made to be a form of the triple science: and this same (offering) becomes the Udavas&acirc;n&icirc;y&acirc;-ish<I>t</I>i (completing oblation) for the performer of the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:10">5:5:5:10</A></FONT></span>10. For, verily, he who performs the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya gains for himself (the benefit of) all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; for him the sacrifice becomes as it were exhausted, and he, as it were, turns away from it. Now the whole sacrifice is just as great as that triple Veda; and this (offering) now is made a form of that (Veda, or</p>

<p><A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A></p>  
<p>sacrifice); this is its womb, its seat: thus he commences once more the sacrifice by means of that triple Veda; and thus his sacrifice is not exhausted, and he does not turn away from it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:11">5:5:5:11</A></FONT></span>11. And, verily, he who performs the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya gains for himself all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; and this offering, the Traidh&acirc;tav&icirc; (ish<I>t</I>i), is instituted by the gods: 'May this offering also be performed by me, may I be consecrated by this one also!' thus he thinks, and therefore this is the completing offering for him who performs the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:12">5:5:5:12</A></FONT></span>12. And also for him who would give (to the priests) a thousand (cows) or more&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, let this be the completing offering. For he who gives a thousand or more becomes as it were emptied out; and that triple Veda is the thousandfold progeny of V&acirc;<I>k</I> (speech): him who was emptied out he thus fills up again with a thousand; and therefore let it be for him also the completing offering.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:13">5:5:5:13</A></FONT></span>13. And also for those who would sit through (perform) a long sacrificial session&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for a year or more, let this be the completing offering. For by those who sit through a long sacrificial session, for a year or more, everything is obtained, everything conquered; but this (offering) is everything: let it therefore be for them also the completing offering.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:14">5:5:5:14</A></FONT></span>14. And indeed one may also practise magic by this (offering); for it was thereby that &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>i bewitched</p>

And by this (offering) indeed Indra also shattered V<I>ri</I>tra's retreat; and, verily, he who therewith practises magic shatters thereby the retreat (of his enemy): therefore one may also practise magic with this (offering).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:5:15">5:5:5:15</A></FONT></span>15. And, indeed, one may also heal thereby; for, verily, whomsoever one would heal by a single <I>ri</I><I>k</I>, by a single ya<I>g</I>us, by a single s&acirc;man, him he would indeed render free from disease; how much more so by the triple Veda! Therefore one may also heal by this (offering).</p>

He presents them to the Brahman; for the Brahman neither performs (like the Adhvaryu), nor chants (like the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>), nor recites (like the Hot<I>ri</I>), and yet he is an object of respect. And with gold they do nothing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and yet it is an object of respect: therefore he presents to the Brahman three gold pieces of a hundred m&acirc;nas each.</p>
