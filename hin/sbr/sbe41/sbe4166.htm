<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:1">7:5:2:1</A></FONT></span>1. He puts the heads of the victims in (the fire-pan),--the heads of the victims being animals (or cattle), it is animals he thus puts thereon. He puts them in the fire-pan;--the pan being these worlds, and the heads of the victims being beasts, he thus</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_401"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 401</FONT></A></p>  
<p>puts animals in these worlds; whence there are animals in these worlds.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:2">7:5:2:2</A></FONT></span>2. And as to why (he puts the heads) in the fire-pan;--the fire-pan being a womb, and the heads of the victims being animals, he thus establishes the animals in the womb: hence animals, though being eaten and cooked, do not diminish, for he establishes them in the womb.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:3">7:5:2:3</A></FONT></span>3. And, again, why he puts the heads of the victims therein;--what (animal) perfections (<I>s</I>r&icirc;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_739"></A><A HREF="#fn_736"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> there were, they are these victims&#8217; heads; and what rumps there were, they are those five layers (of the altar). Now those five layers are these worlds, and these worlds are this very fire-pan: thus, when he puts the heads of the victims in the fire-pan, he thereby unites those rumps with those heads.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:4">7:5:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. He puts them in the fore-part, so as to look towards the back (west). For when, on that (former) occasion, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati wanted to slaughter these animals, they, being about to be slaughtered, wanted to run away. He seized them by (the organs of) the vital airs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_740"></A><A HREF="#fn_737"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and having seized them by the vital airs, he took them into himself from the front (mouth) towards the back (inside).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:5">7:5:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. Now the same thing which the gods did is done here. The animals do not, indeed, want to run away from him; but when he does this, it is because he wants to do what the gods did: having thus seized them by (the outlets of) the vital airs, he takes them into himself from the front towards the back.</p>  
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:6">7:5:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. And, again, why he puts the heads of the victims thereon. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati alone was here at first&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_741"></A><A HREF="#fn_738"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. He desired, 'May I create food, may I be reproduced!' He fashioned animals from his vital airs, a man from his soul (mind), a horse from his eye, a cow from his breath, a sheep from his ear, and a goat from his voice; and inasmuch as he created them from the vital airs, people say that 'Animals are vital airs.' The soul is the first of the vital airs; and inasmuch as he fashioned man from his soul, they say that 'Man is the first, and strongest of animals.' The soul is all the vital airs, for in the soul all the vital airs are established. And inasmuch as he fashioned man from his soul, they say that 'Man is all animals,' for they all belong to man.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:7">7:5:2:7</A></FONT></span>7. Having created that food, he took it into himself from the front towards the back; and hence whosoever prepares for himself food, takes it into himself from the front towards the back (inside). That (animal food being put) in the fire-pan, and the fire-pan being the belly, he thus puts the food into the belly.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:8">7:5:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. He now (in the first place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_742"></A><A HREF="#fn_739"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>) thrusts gold chips into each of them,--gold is vital air, and the vital airs go out of these animals when slaughtered: thus, when he thrusts gold chips into each of them, he puts the vital airs into them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:9">7:5:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. Seven (chips) he thrusts into each,--seven vital airs there are in the head: these he thereby puts into it. And if there are five victims, let him thrust in five times seven (chips); for those five victims he puts on (the fire-pan), and there are seven vital</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_403"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 403</FONT></A></p>  
<p>airs in each victim: he thus puts the vital airs into all of them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:10">7:5:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. Now, even if there is only one victim&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_743"></A><A HREF="#fn_740"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, some people thrust five times seven (into that one head), thinking, 'Those five victims he puts down (symbolically), and there are seven vital airs in each victim: thus we put the vital airs into all of them.' Let him not do so, for in this animal the form of all animals is contained&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_744"></A><A HREF="#fn_741"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and when he thrusts (seven chips) into this one, he thereby puts the vital airs into all of them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:11">7:5:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. The first (chip) he thrusts into the mouth, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIII, 38; <I>Ri</I>k S. IV, 58, 6, 5), 'Fitly flow the draughts of milk like rivers,'--draughts of milk are food, and that indeed flows fitly into this mouth;--'purified within by the heart, by the mind,'--for the food is indeed purified by the heart and mind within him who is righteous;--'the streams of ghee I behold,' he thereby means the libations he is about to offer on that fire;--'the golden reed (is) in the middle of Agni,' he thereby means that gold man.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:12">7:5:2:12</A></FONT></span>12. With (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIII, 39), 'For praise thee!' (he thrusts one in) here (into the right nostril); praise (or splendour) means breath, for with breath one praises;--with, 'For sheen thee!' here (into the left nostril); sheen means breath, for by breath one shines; and also because everything here shines for breath;--with, 'For brightness thee!' here (into the right eye);--with, 'For lustre thee!' here</p>

S. XIII, 40), 'Agni, bright with brightness, the golden disk, lustrous with lustre,' here (into the left ear),--thus with two (formulas) containing 'all&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_745"></A><A HREF="#fn_742"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>'; for the ear is all.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:13">7:5:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. He then lifts up the human head--he thereby exalts it--with, 'Giver of a thousand thou art: for a thousand thee!' a thousand means everything: thus, 'the giver of everything, for everything (I bestow) thee!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:14">7:5:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. He then puts them (the heads) in (the fire-pan), first (that of) the man--having taken possession of the man by strength he sets him up;--the man in the middle; on both sides the other victims: he thus sets the man, as the eater, in the midst of cattle; whence man is the eater in the midst of cattle.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:15">7:5:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. The horse and ram on the left (north) side: he thereby puts those two (kinds of) cattle in that region; whence those two (kinds of) cattle are most plentiful in that region.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:16">7:5:2:16</A></FONT></span>16. The bull and he-goat on the right (south) side: he thereby puts those two (kinds of) cattle in that region; whence those two (kinds of) cattle are most plentiful in that region.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:17">7:5:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. The (head of the) man he places on the milk&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_746"></A><A HREF="#fn_743"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,--milk means cattle: he thus establishes the Sacrificer among cattle,--with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIII, 41), 'With</p>

<p><A NAME="page_405"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 405</FONT></A></p>  
<p>milk anoint thou &Acirc;ditya, the unborn child!' that unborn child, the man, is indeed the sun: thus, Him anoint thou with milk!--'the all-shaped maker of a thousand,' the maker&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_747"></A><A HREF="#fn_744"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of a thousand is man; for to him belong a thousand;--'spare him with thy heat, harbour not evil thoughts against him!' that is, spare him with thy fire, do not hurt him!--'make him live a hundred years, while thou art built!' he thereby makes man the one among animals (capable of) living a hundred years; whence man, among animals, lives up to- a hundred years.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:18">7:5:2:18</A></FONT></span>18. Then on the left side (he puts the head of) the horse, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIII, 42), 'The speed of the wind,'--this one, the horse, is indeed the speed of the wind;--'Varu<I>n</I>a's navel'--for the horse is Varu<I>n</I>a;--'the horse, born in the midst of the flood;' the flood is the water, and the horse is indeed the water-born;--'the tawny, rock-founded child of rivers;' rock means mountain, and the waters are indeed founded on the mountains;--'harm him not, Agni, in the highest region!' the highest region means these worlds: thus, do not harm him in these worlds!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:19">7:5:2:19</A></FONT></span>19. Then on the right side (the head of) the bull, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIII, 43), 'The imperishable, red drop,' the drop doubtless is Soma; and that bull is the same as the imperishable Soma;--'the eager one (bhura<I>n</I>yu),' that is, the bearer (bhart<I>ri</I>);--'Agni, the forward-striving, I glorify with homages;' for</p>

<p><A NAME="page_406"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 406</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the bull is sacred to Agni; and 'the forward-striving,' he says, because forward (towards the east) they hold up Agni&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_748"></A><A HREF="#fn_745"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and towards the front&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_749"></A><A HREF="#fn_746"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> they attend upon him;--'duly fitting thyself by limbs,' when he is built up, then he does indeed duly fit himself limb by limb;--'harm not the inexhaustible, wide-ruling cow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_750"></A><A HREF="#fn_747"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>,' the cow is indeed wide-ruling (vir&acirc;<I>g</I>), and the wide-ruling is food, and accordingly the cow is food.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:20">7:5:2:20</A></FONT></span>20. Then on the left side (he puts the head of) the ram, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIII, 44), 'The defender of Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>, the navel of Varu<I>n</I>a,' for the ewe is sacred both to Varu<I>n</I>a and to Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>;--'the ewe born from the highest sphere;' the highest sphere doubtless is the ear, and the ear is the regions,--(thus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_751"></A><A HREF="#fn_748"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>) the highest sphere is the regions;--'the mighty, thousandfold artifice of the &Acirc;sura,' that is, the great, thousandfold artifice of the &Acirc;sura&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_752"></A><A HREF="#fn_749"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>;--'O Agni, harm it not in the highest</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:21">7:5:2:21</A></FONT></span>21. Then on the right side (he puts the head of) the he-goat, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XII I, 45), 'The Agni who was born from Agni,' for that Agni was indeed born from Agni&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_753"></A><A HREF="#fn_750"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>;--'from the pain of the earth or also of the sky;' for what was born from the pain (or heat) of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, that was born from the pain of the sky and the earth;--'whereby Vi<I>s</I>vakarman begat living beings,'--the he-goat (or, the unborn one) is V&acirc;<I>k</I> (Speech)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_754"></A><A HREF="#fn_751"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and from V&acirc;<I>k</I> Vi<I>s</I>vakarman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_755"></A><A HREF="#fn_752"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> begat living beings;--'him, O Agni, may thy wrath spare!' as the text, so the meaning.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:22">7:5:2:22</A></FONT></span>22. These are the victims; separately he puts them down, separately he 'settles' them, and separately he pronounces the S&ucirc;dadohas on them; for separate from one another are those animals.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:23">7:5:2:23</A></FONT></span>23. He then offers on the human head,--sacrifice is offering: he thus makes man the one among animals fit to sacrifice; whence man alone among animals performs sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:24">7:5:2:24</A></FONT></span>24. And, again, why he offers thereon:--he thereby lays vigour into the head. He offers with ghee,--ghee is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means vigour: he thus lays vigour into it. With 'Hail' (he offers),--the 'Hail' (sv&acirc;h&acirc;k&acirc;ra, m.) is a male, and the male means vigour: he thus lays vigour into it. With a trish<I>t</I>ubh verse (he offers);the Trish<I>t</I>ubh is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt</p>

<p><A NAME="page_408"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 408</FONT></A></p>  
<p>means vigour; the Trish<I>t</I>ubh is vigour: with vigour he thus lays vigour into it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:25">7:5:2:25</A></FONT></span>25. Having run through&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_756"></A><A HREF="#fn_753"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the (first) half-verse, he pronounces the Sv&acirc;h&acirc;;--the <I>ri</I><I>k</I> (verse) is a bone: having cleft asunder that skull-bone which is here inside the head, he there lays vigour into it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:26">7:5:2:26</A></FONT></span>26. Having then run through the (second) half-verse, he pronounces the Sv&acirc;h&acirc;,--having joined together that skull-bone which is here on the top of the head, he there lays vigour into it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:27">7:5:2:27</A></FONT></span>27. [V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIII, 46; <I>Ri</I>k S. I, 115, 1] 'The brilliant front of the gods hath risen,' for that man is yonder sun, and he indeed rises as the brilliant front (face) of the gods;--'the eye of Mitra, Varu<I>n</I>a, and Agni,' for that (sun) is the eye of both gods and men;--'he hath filled heaven, and earth, and the air,' for when he rises he indeed fills these worlds;--'S&ucirc;rya, the soul of the movable and immovable;' for that (sun) is indeed the soul of everything here that moves and stands.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:28">7:5:2:28</A></FONT></span>28. He then stands by (the heads, revering them) with the Utsargas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_757"></A><A HREF="#fn_754"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. For at that time when Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati wanted to slaughter the victims, they, being about to be slaughtered, were distressed (or pained); and by these Utsargas he drove out their distress&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_758"></A><A HREF="#fn_755"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, their evil. In like manner does this one, by these Utsargas, now drive out their distress, their evil.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:29">7:5:2:29</A></FONT></span>29. Now some remove the distress of whichever (head of a) victim they put down, thinking lest they might put distress, evil, thereon; but it is they that</p>

<p>put distress, evil, thereon; for the distress they remove from the preceding one, they put on (the altar) with the succeeding one.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:30">7:5:2:30</A></FONT></span>30. And some revere (the heads) whilst moving round them, thinking, 'we remove distress upwards;' but these indeed follow the distress, the evil, upwards; for upwards he (the Sacrificer) goes by this performance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_759"></A><A HREF="#fn_756"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and upwards they remove the distress.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:31">7:5:2:31</A></FONT></span>31. Let him remove it outside the fire (-altar); that fire (-altar) being these worlds, he thus puts distress outside these worlds;--outside the Vedi; the Vedi being this earth, he thus puts distress outside this earth; (he does so) standing with his face towards the north; for in that region those animals are, and he thus puts distress into them in the region in which they are.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:32">7:5:2:32</A></FONT></span>32. He first removes that of the man--for him he puts down first--with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIII, 47), 'Harm not this two-footed animal!' the two-footed animal doubtless is the same as man: thus, 'do not harm that one!'--'(thou) the thousand-eyed, being built for pith;'--the thousand-eyed he (Agni) is on account of the chips of gold; 'for pith,' that is, 'for food.'--'Graciously accept thou, O Agni, the sham-man, the victim, as pith!' a sham-man is a kim-purusha (mock-man)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_760"></A><A HREF="#fn_757"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: thus, 'accept graciously the kim-purusha, O Agni!'--'Building up therewith thy forms, get thee settled!' the form is the self: thus, 'Building up</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:33">7:5:2:33</A></FONT></span>33. Then that of the horse, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIII, 48), 'Harm not this one-hoofed animal!' the one-hoofed animal doubtless is the same as the horse: thus, do not harm that one!--'the racer neighing among the racers;' for neighing indeed he is, and a racer among racers;--'The wild fallow (beast) do I assign unto thee,' he thereby assigns to him the wild fallow (beast)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_762"></A><A HREF="#fn_759"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>;--'building up therewith thy forms, get thee settled!' that is, 'building up therewith, perfect thyself!'--'Let thy burning heat reach the fallow beast! let thy burning heat reach him whom we hate!' he thereby lays burning heat into the fallow beast, and into him whom he hates.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:5:2:34">7:5:2:34</A></FONT></span>34. Then that of the bull, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S.
