### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:1">6:7:3:1</span></span>1. He
then holds it (the fire in the pan) up thus (towards north-east). Now
the gods at that time were desiring, 'May we be like Par*g*anya (the
rain-god)!' By that body (of his <span id="fr_530"></span>[1](#fn_528).md)
they became like Par*g*anya, and in like manner does the Sacrificer by
that body (of his) become like Par*g*anya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:2">6:7:3:2</span></span>2.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 6; *Ri*k S. X, 45, 4\] 'Agni roared like the thundering
sky,'--for he (Agni) indeed roars like the thundering
Par*g*anya;--'again and again licking the ground, stroking <span
id="fr_531"></span>[2](#fn_529.md) the plants,'--for Par*g*anya, whilst
licking again and

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

again the ground, does stroke the plants;--'scarce born, the kindled
shone forth,'--for scarce born he indeed lights up everything
here;--'with his light he shineth between the two worlds,'--the two
worlds, doubtless, are the heaven and the earth, and these two he indeed
illumes by his light. He holds it (the fire in the pan) up so as to be
beyond the reach of his arms, for Par*g*anya is beyond the reach of
(our) arms.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:3">6:7:3:3</span></span>3. He
then lowers it; for whatever sap, whatever sustenance there is in this
world, that rises upwards with it through these worlds, for Agni is the
sap, Agni is the substance in this world: thus were that always to be
so <span id="fr_532"></span>[1](#fn_530.md), then there would be no sap, no
sustenance in this world; but when he lowers (the fire), he bestows sap
and sustenance on this world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:4">6:7:3:4</span></span>4. And,
again, why he lowers it,--he then indeed rises upwards from here through
these worlds: that is, as it were, a rising away from here. But this
earth is the resting-place; and were that always to be so, the
Sacrificer would be removed from this world. But when he lowers (the
fire), he thereby comes back to this resting-place, and stands firmly on
this resting-place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:5">6:7:3:5</span></span>5. And,
again, why he lowers it,--there, indeed, in rising upwards, he conquers
these worlds from here: that is, as it were, a conquering in a forward
direction. Now the conquest of him who conquers only in a forward
direction is completed by others; but for him who conquers both ways
there is free scope: thus, when he lowers (the fire) he conquers

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

these worlds both from here upwards and from thence backwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:6">6:7:3:6</span></span>6.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 7-10\] 'Ever returning Agni, turn thou back unto me,
with life, with vigour, with offspring, with riches; with gain, with
wisdom, with wealth, with prosperity!--O Agni, Aṅgiras! may thine be a
hundred courses, and a thousand returns: with increase of increase bring
back what was lost by us, and bring us again riches!--Return again with
sustenance, again, O Agni, with food and life, guard us again from
trouble!--With wealth return, O Agni, overflow with the all-feeding
stream on every side!'--that is, 'with all this return thou to me!' Four
times he lowers (the fire further and further), for four times it rises
upwards: thus as often as it rises upwards, so often he lowers it; and
having lowered it (completely), he holds it above his navel: the
significance of this has been explained <span
id="fr_533"></span>[1](#fn_531.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:7">6:7:3:7</span></span>7. He
then addresses him (Agni); for Agni is vital power: he thus lays vital
power into his self: \[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 11\] 'Hither have I brought
thee,'--for they do indeed bring him hither;--'thou hast entered,'--he
then lays vital power into his self;--'stand thou firm, never
staggering!'--he thus lays the vital power firmly into his self;--'may
all the people long for thee!'--the people are food: thus, 'may all food
long for thee!'--'may thy rule not fall away from thee!'--rule means
glory: thus, 'may thy glory not fall away from thee!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:8">6:7:3:8</span></span>8. He
then unties the sling of the netting, and the sling of the gold plate;
for the sling belongs to

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Varu*n*a: he thus
frees himself from Varu*n*a's noose. He does so with a verse to
Varu*n*a: he thus frees himself from Varu*n*a's noose by its own self,
by its own deity. \[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 12; *Ri*k S. I, 24, 15\] 'Take off
from us, O Varu*n*a, the uppermost cord, down (take) the lowest, away
the middle one!'--as the text, so the meaning;--'and so, O Âditya, may
we be sinless in thy service for safety (Aditi)!'--Aditi is this earth:
thus, 'Sinless may we belong to thee and to her (the earth)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:9">6:7:3:9</span></span>9. He
then holds him (Agni) up thus (towards south-east); for on that former
occasion he raises him upwards from here towards the east with the
fashioning formula <span id="fr_534"></span>[1](#fn_532.md); and he then
holds him up thus (towards north-east <span
id="fr_535"></span>[2](#fn_533).md). Now were that alone to take place, he
(the sun), surely, would stop even there (in the north); but inasmuch as
he now holds him up thus (towards south-east), he (the sun) having gone
thus (in a northerly direction), then comes back again thus (in a
southerly direction).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:10">6:7:3:10</span></span>10.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 13; *Ri*k S. X, 1, 1\] 'The great hath stood up erect
before the Dawns,'--for before the dawn the great one (Agni) indeed
stands up erect;--'emerged from the gloom he hath come with light,'--for
emerged from the gloom, the night, he indeed comes with light, with the
day;--'well-shapen with white light,'--for he, Agni, is indeed
well-shapen with white light;'--'when born, he hath filled all
homesteads;'--all homesteads, doubtless, means these worlds, and these
he indeed fills, when born. He holds him up so as to be beyond the reach
of the arms, for he (the

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

sun) is beyond the reach of arms from here. He then lowers him: he
thereby comes back to this resting-place, and stands firmly on this
resting-place. \[He does so\] with a *g*agatî verse <span
id="fr_536"></span>[1](#fn_534.md), for the *G*agatî gains these worlds
from above hitherwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:11">6:7:3:11</span></span>11.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 14; *Ri*k S. IV, 40, 5\] 'The swan dwelling in the
light,'--the swan dwelling in the light, doubtless, is yonder sun;--'the
Vasu dwelling in the air,'--the Vasu dwelling in the air, doubtless, is
the wind;--'the priest seated on the altar,'--the priest seated on the
altar, doubtless, is Agni;--'the guest,'--for he (Agni) is indeed the
guest of all beings;--'dwelling in the retreat <span
id="fr_537"></span>[2](#fn_535.md),'--that is, 'dwelling in rugged
places;'--'the man-dwelling,'--the man-dwelling, doubtless, is the vital
air; and men are human beings: he thus means that vital air, that fire,
which (burns) in human beings;--'the space-dwelling,'--for he (Agni)
indeed is seated in all spaces;--'the law-seated,'--that is, 'the
truth-seated;'--'the sphere-dwelling,'--for he is indeed seated in all
spheres;--'the water-born, cow-born'--for he is indeed both water-born
and cow-born;--'law-born,'--that is, 'truth-born;'--'rock-born,'--for he
is born from the rock;--'the law,'--that is, 'the truth.' With 'the
Great!' he deposits it (the fire); for he (Agni) is indeed the great
(truth): he thus deposits him (on the seat) after making him what he is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:12">6:7:3:12</span></span>12.
\[He does so\] with two syllables ('b*ri*hat'),--the Sacrificer is
two-footed, and the Sacrificer is

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agni: as great as
Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus deposits him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:13">6:7:3:13</span></span>13. He
then stands worshipping by him; for he makes, as it were, light of him,
when he strides with him through these worlds both thus (upwards), and
thus (downwards): he now makes amends to him, so that he (Agni) may not
hurt him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:14">6:7:3:14</span></span>14.
And, again, why he stands by him;--the gods at that time were afraid,
lest he should injure these worlds of theirs from anigh: they thereby
appeased him towards these worlds; and in like manner does he (the
Sacrificer) now appease him towards these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:15">6:7:3:15</span></span>15.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 15-17\] 'Seat thee in this thy mother's lap, thou, O
Agni, knowing all ordinances! burn her not with thy heat, thy flame!
shine in her with a brilliant light!--Glowing with light and heat within
thine own seat, be thou gracious unto this Ukhâ, O knower of
beings!--Being gracious unto me, O Agni, now seat thee graciously! seat
thee here in thine own seat, having made happy all the regions!'--by
saying 'Gracious--Gracious,' he appeases him, so that he may not injure
any one, and thus he, being appeased, does not injure these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:7:3:16">6:7:3:16</span></span>16.
With three (verses) he stands by worshipping;--three in number are these
worlds, and threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his
measure, with so much he thereby makes amends to him, and with so much
does he thereby appease him towards these worlds.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_528"></span>[277:1](sbe4151.htm#fr_530.md) Viz. by the Agni
who is now being held up, and of whom Par*g*anya is said to be another
form, at [VI, 1, 3, 15](sbe4130.htm#6:1:3:15.md). It is probably the smoke
rising from the fire-pan that suggests the idea of the Jupiter pluvius
sending forth his flashes of light from the dark cloud.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[277:2](sbe4151.htm#fr_531.md) Literally,
anointing (? either furbishing, or impregnating).

<span id="fn_530"></span>[278:1](sbe4151.htm#fr_532.md) Literally, were
that to be so much only (i.e. were the fire always to be held up there).

<span id="fn_534"></span>[281:1](sbe4151.htm#fr_536.md) It is rather a
trish*t*ubh verse.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[281:2](sbe4151.htm#fr_537) Rather, (the guest.md)
dwelling in the house (duro*n*a-sad), but the author evidently derives
'duro*n*a' from 'dus' (bad), making it a synonym of 'durga.'
