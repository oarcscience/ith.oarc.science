#### THE SEARCH AND DIGGING FOR AGNI

#### (THE LUMP OF CLAY).

### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:2:1">6:3:2:1</span></span>1. The
spade is still in his hand, when he addresses the beasts. For when the
gods at that time were about to search (for Agni) in these (animals)
they placed their vigour in front; and in like manner does

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

this one, now that he is about to search in these (animals), place his
vigour in front.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:2:2">6:3:2:2</span></span>2. He
addresses the horse, with (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 12), 'Most speedily <span
id="fr_416"></span>[1](#fn_416.md), O courser, run hither,'--what is swift,
that is speedy, and what is swifter than swift, that is most
speedy;--'along the widest range,'--the widest range doubtless is this
(earth): thus, 'along this wide range;'--'in the sky is thy highest
home, in the air thy navel, upon earth thy womb:' he thus makes it to be
those deities, Agni, Vâyu, and Âditya (the sun), and thus lays vigour
into the horse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:2:3">6:3:2:3</span></span>3. Then
the ass, with (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 13), 'Yoke ye two the ass,' he says this to
the Adhvaryu and the Sacrificer;--'upon this course, ye showerers of
wealth!'--that is, 'upon this performance, ye showerers of
wealth;'--'him, bearing Agni, and helpful <span
id="fr_417"></span>[2](#fn_417.md) unto us;'--that is, 'him, bearing Agni,
and urged forward by us:' he thereby lays vigour into the ass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:2:4">6:3:2:4</span></span>4. Then
the he-goat, with (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 14), 'At every yoking, at every race,
we call him, the most powerful,'--race <span
id="fr_418"></span>[3](#fn_418.md) means food: thus, 'in every performance,
in respect of every food we call him, the most powerful;'--'Indra to our
help, we his friends!'--that is, 'him, the strong (indriyavat), to our
help:' he thereby lays vigour into the he-goat.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:2:5">6:3:2:5</span></span>5. With
three (formulas) he addresses (the victims),--threefold is Agni: as
great as Agni is, as

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

great as is his measure, by so much he thus lays vigour into them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:2:6">6:3:2:6</span></span>6. He
then makes them walk forward to the east: he thus searches for him
(Agni) by means of these animals. He does not touch (them) lest he,
Agni, should injure him; for Agni is the same as the animals <span
id="fr_419"></span>[1](#fn_419.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:2:7">6:3:2:7</span></span>7. He
makes the horse walk on, with (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 15), 'Forth-speeding, come
treading down the curses!'--curse means evil: thus, 'running come,
treading down the evil!'--'come, delighting, into Rudra's
chieftainship!'--beasts belong to Rudra: thus, 'come thou, delighting,
into the chieftainship of him who is thy deity!' he thus searches for
him by means of the horse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:2:8">6:3:2:8</span></span>8. Then
the ass with, Traverse the wide air, thou possessed of prosperous
pastures and affording safety!'--as the text, so its meaning;--'with
Pûshan as thy mate;'--Pûshan, doubtless, is this earth; thus, 'together
with her as thy mate:' he thus searches for him by means of the ass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:2:9">6:3:2:9</span></span>9. Then
the he-goat, with (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 16), 'From the Earth's seat,
Aṅgiras-like, bring thou Agni Purîshya!'--that is, 'from the Earth's lap
bring thou Agni, favourable to cattle, as Agni (did)!' he thus searches
for him (Agni) by means of the he-goat.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:2:10">6:3:2:10</span></span>10.
With three (animals) he searches,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni
is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus searches for him.

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> By three
(formulas) he first addresses (the beasts); that makes six,--six seasons
are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is
his measure, so great does this become.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_416"></span>[204:1](sbe4135.htm#fr_416.md) Pratûrtam, 'sped
forward, speeding forward.'

<span id="fn_417"></span>[204:2](sbe4135.htm#fr_417.md) Asmayu, 'tending
towards us, favourable to us,' is explained differently by the author of
the Brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[204:3](sbe4135.htm#fr_418.md) The author here, as
elsewhere, rather takes 'vâ*g*a' in the sense of 'strength, sustenance.'

<span id="fn_419"></span>[205:1](sbe4135.htm#fr_419.md) The text here has
the ordinary Sanskrit construction, running literally thus:--he does not
touch--Agni (being) the same as the animals--'lest he, Agni, should
injure me!'
