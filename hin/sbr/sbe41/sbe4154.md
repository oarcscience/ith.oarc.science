### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:2:1">6:8:2:1</span></span>1. Now,
then, as to the taking down of the ashes (to the water <span
id="fr_550"></span>[1](#fn_548)). Now, the gods at that time threw out
the ashes (from the pan). They said, 'If we make this, such as it is,
part of our own self, we shall become mortal carcases, not freed from
sin; and if we cast it away, we shall put outside of Agni what therein
is of Agni's nature: find ye out in what manner we shall do this!'--They
said, 'Meditate ye (*k*it)!' whereby, indeed, they said, 'Seek ye a
layer (or altar, *k*iti). Seek ye in what manner we shall do this!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:2:2">6:8:2:2</span></span>2. While
meditating, they saw this,--'Let us take it down to the water; for the
water is the foundation of this universe: having settled it on that
wherein is the foundation of this universe, we shall reproduce from out
of the water what there is of Agni's nature in this (heap of ashes).'
They then took it down to (and threw it into) the water; and in like
manner does this (Sacrificer) now take it down to the water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:2:3">6:8:2:3</span></span>3.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 35\] 'O divine waters, receive ye these ashes, and put
them in a soft and fragrant place!'--that, being consumed (matter), has
run its course (is useless): regarding that he says, 'Put it in, the
most fragrant place!'--'May

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

the wives, wedded to a good lord, bow down to him,'--the wives,
doubtless, are the waters, for from the waters this universe is
produced; and in Agni the waters have indeed a good lord;--'bear it on
the waters, even as a mother (bears) her son!'--that is, 'as a mother
would bear her son on her lap, so bear ye this!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:2:4">6:8:2:4</span></span>4.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 36; *Ri*k S. VIII, 43, 9\] 'In the waters, O Agni, is
thy seat,'--that is, 'in the waters, O Agni, is thy womb; as such thou
clingest to the plants,'--for he does indeed cling to (love) the
plants,--'being in (their) womb thou art born again,'--when he is in the
womb he is indeed born again,--\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 37\] 'Thou art the child
of the herbs, the child of the trees, the child of all that is, O Agni,
thou art the child of the waters;'--he thus makes him (Agni) the child
of this entire (universe).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:2:5">6:8:2:5</span></span>5. With
three (verses) he throws (the ashes into the water),--threefold is Agni:
as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus
throws them down. First with one (prayer), and then with two; or first
with two, and then with one,--but at two separate times he throws them
down: he thus throws them down by means of the two-footed animals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:2:6">6:8:2:6</span></span>6. He
then takes some (of the ashes) therefrom: he thereby reproduces from the
waters what there is of Agni's nature in that (heap of ashes). \[He
takes it\] with that (nameless or little finger), for with that (finger)
medicine is prepared: it is with that one he thus puts him (Agni)
together. \[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 38-41\] 'Having settled <span
id="fr_551"></span>[1](#fn_549) in the womb, as

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

ashes, in the waters, and the earth, O Agni,'--by his ashes he is,
indeed, settled in the womb, that is, both in the waters and in the
earth;--'having united with the mothers, thou hast again, brightly
shining, seated thee;'--that is, 'Having joined thy mothers, thou, the
shining one, hast again seated thyself (in thy home).'--'Having again
seated thee in thy seat, the waters and the earth, O Agni, thou liest in
her (the earth, or pan) most happy, as in a mother's lap.'--'Return
again with sustenance, again, O Agni, with food and life; guard us again
from trouble!--With wealth return, O Agni, overflow with the all-feeding
stream on every side!'--that is, 'With all this return thou to me!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:2:7">6:8:2:7</span></span>7. With
four (verses) he takes (some of the ashes);--he thereby supplies him
(Agni) with four-footed animals; and animals being food, it is with food
he thus supplies him. With three (verses) he takes (the ashes) down (to
the water),--that makes seven, for of seven layers consists the
fire-altar <span id="fr_552"></span>[1](#fn_550), seven seasons are a
year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his
measure, so great does this become.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:2:8">6:8:2:8</span></span>8. Having
taken some of the ashes, and returned, he throws it into the fire-pan,
and stands by (the fire) worshipping it; for when he throws Agni into
the water he does what is improper; he now makes amends to him so that
he may not injure him. With two (verses) relating to Agni (he
worships),--for it is to Agni that he makes amends,--and with such

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

as contain (the verb) 'budh' (to attend to, awake), in order that Agni
may attend to this speech of his.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:2:9">6:8:2:9</span></span>9.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 42-3; *Ri*k S. I, 147, 2; II, 6, 4\] 'Attend thou to
this word of mine, O youngest!'--that is, 'attend to this word of mine,
O youngest!'--'put forth most plentifully, O faithful one!'--that is,
'put forth most abundantly, O faithful one!'--'this one revileth thee,
and that one singeth thy praises,'--that is, 'one (man) reviles thee,
and another sings thy praises;'--'reverently I revere thy body, O
Agni!'--that is, 'I, thy reverer, revere thy body, O Agni!'--'Be thou a
munificent patron of offerings, O lord of wealth, the bestower of
wealth, keep off from us the haters!' this he says in order that he may
keep off haters from him. With two (verses) he worships the fire, a
Gâyatrî and a Trish*t*ubh verse: the significance of this has been
explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:2:10">6:8:2:10</span></span>10.
These make nine (verses),--there are nine regions <span
id="fr_553"></span>[1](#fn_551), and Agni is the regions; nine vital
airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is
his measure, so great does this become.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:2:11">6:8:2:11</span></span>11. He
then performs two expiations; for it is for (the obtainment of) all his
desires that he sets up that (fire);--thus whatever part of his desires
is here cut off when the fire is thrown into the water, that he thereby
joins together and restores. He performs both expiations which (are
performed) when the fire has gone out <span
id="fr_554"></span>[2](#fn_552): the significance of this has been
explained.

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:2:12">6:8:2:12</span></span>12.
This makes ten (performances),--the Virâ*g* consists of ten syllables,
and Agni is the Virâ*g* <span id="fr_555"></span>[1](#fn_553); there are
ten regions, and Agni is the regions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the
vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great
does this become.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_548"></span>[293:1](sbe4154.htm#fr_550) The ashes removed
from the 'ukhâ' or fire-pan are put in a bag made of leaves of some
sacred tree, and are then thrown into the water in two portions. As they
are floating on the water, a small portion is taken from them again with
the little finger and put in the pan.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[294:1](sbe4154.htm#fr_551) 'Pra-sad' (=
pra-âp, Mahîdhara) seems here really to have the <span id="page_295">p.
295</span> meaning of 'abhiprasad' or 'anuprasad,' as the accusative can
scarcely be taken along with 'âsada*h*.'

<span id="fn_550"></span>[295:1](sbe4154.htm#fr_552) See [p.
249](sbe4145.htm#page_249), note [3](sbe4145.htm#fn_486).

<span id="fn_551"></span>[296:1](sbe4154.htm#fr_553) Viz. the four
cardinal points, and the four intermediate points, of the compass, and
the upper region. To these paragraph [12](sbe4154.htm#6:8:2:12) adds, as
a tenth, the lower region.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[296:2](sbe4154.htm#fr_554) [VI, 6, 4,
10](sbe4148.htm#6:6:4:10) seq.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[297:1](sbe4154.htm#fr_555) That is, the
wide-shining, or wide-ruling one.
