#### B. THE RÂ*G*ASÛYA, OR INAUGURATION OF A KING.

### SECOND ADHYÂYA. THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:3:1">5:2:3:1</span></span>1. He
offers a full-offering <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_98.md); for the full
means the All: 'May I be consecrated after encompassing the All!' thus
he thinks. At this (offering) he bestows a boon; for a boon means all:
'Having encompassed the All (the universe), may I be consecrated! thus
he thinks. He may perform this offering, if he chooses; or, if he
chooses, he may disregard it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:3:2">5:2:3:2</span></span>2. And on
the following day he prepares a cake on eight potsherds, as sacrificial
food for Anumati <span id="fr_99"></span>[2](#fn_99.md). And whatever
portion of (the grains) being ground,--either flour or
rice-grains,--falls down behind the pin, that he throws together into
the dipping-spoon

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (sruva) <span
id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100.md). They take a firebrand from the
Anvâhâryapa*k*ana (or southern) fire, and therewith go southward. And
where he finds a self-produced hollow <span
id="fr_101"></span>[2](#fn_101.md) or cleft,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:3:3">5:2:3:3</span></span>3. Having
there made up a fire, he offers with (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 35), 'This, O
Nir*ri*ti, is thy portion: accept it graciously, hail!' For Nir*ri*ti is
this (Earth); whomsoever she seizes upon with evil, him she seizes upon
with destruction (nir*ri*ti): hence whatever part of this (Earth) is of
the Nir*ri*ti nature, that he thereby propitiates; and thus Nir*ri*ti
does not seize upon him, while being consecrated. And the reason why he
offers in a self-produced hollow or

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

cleft, is that that much of this (earth) is possessed with Nir*ri*ti.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:3:4">5:2:3:4</span></span>4. They
then return (to the sacrificial ground) without looking backward. He now
proceeds with the cake on eight potsherds for Anumati. For Anumati is
this (Earth); and whosoever knows to do that work which he intends to
do, for him indeed she approves (arm-man) thereof: hence it is her he
thereby pleases, thinking 'May I be consecrated, approved by that
(genius of) approval!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:3:5">5:2:3:5</span></span>5. And as
to why it is a (cake) on eight potsherds,--the Gâyatrî consists of eight
syllables, and this earth is Gâyatrî. And as to why he offers of the
same sacrificial food <span id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_102.md) both
(oblations): thereby, indeed, both of it comes to be this latter one
(viz. Anumati, or approval). A garment is the sacrificial fee for this
(offering): for even as one clad in a garment does not venture into the
forest, but having deposited that garment (somewhere) escapes (robbers),
in like manner no assault befalls him while being consecrated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:3:6">5:2:3:6</span></span>6. And on
the following day he prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and
Vish*n*u, and offers it in the same way as the (regular) ish*t*i: this
indeed is just what that approved initiation-offering to Agni and
Vish*n*u is there <span id="fr_103"></span>[2](#fn_103.md). Now Agni is all
the deities, since in Agni one offers to all deities; and Agni forsooth
is the lower end, and Vish*n*u is the upper end: 'May I be consecrated,
after thus encompassing all the deities, and after encompassing

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

the whole sacrifice!' thus he thinks, and hence there is a cake on
eleven potsherds to Agni and Vish*n*u. Gold is the sacrificial fee for
this (offering); for to Agni belongs this sacrifice, and gold is Agni's
seed. As to Vish*n*u, he is the sacrifice, and Agni forsooth is the
sacrifice: nevertheless this is Agni's alone, therefore gold is the fee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:3:7">5:2:3:7</span></span>7. And on
the following day he prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and
Soma, and offers it in the same way as an (ordinary) ish*t*i, for it was
thereby Indra slew V*ri*tra, and thereby he gained that universal
conquest which now is his. And in like manner does this (king, the
Sacrificer) thereby slay his wicked, hateful enemy, and in like manner
does he gain the victory. 'May I be consecrated, when safety and
security from evil-doers have been gained!' thus. he thinks: hence there
is a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma. For this (offering) a
bull set at liberty is the sacrificial fee; for yonder moon <span
id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_104.md) they slay while setting him at
liberty <span id="fr_105"></span>[2](#fn_105.md): to wit, by the full-moon
offering they slay him, and by the new-moon offering they set him at
liberty;--therefore a bull set at liberty is the fee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:3:8">5:2:3:8</span></span>8. And on
the following day he prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and
Agni, and offers it in the same way as an (ordinary) ish*t*i. Now when

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Indra slew
V*ri*tra, that vigour and energy of his went out of him, being
frightened: by this offering he again possessed himself of that vigour
and energy. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) by this offering
possess himself of vigour and energy; for Agni is fiery spirit, and
Indra is vigour and energy: 'May I be consecrated, having embraced both
these energies!' thus he thinks: hence there is a cake on twelve
potsherds for Indra and Agni. A bull is the fee for this (offering), for
by his shoulder he is of Agni's nature <span
id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_106.md), and by his testicles he is of Indra's
nature: therefore a bull is the fee for it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:3:9">5:2:3:9</span></span>9.
Thereupon he performs the offering of first-fruits <span
id="fr_107"></span>[2](#fn_107.md); for verily he who performs the
Râ*g*asûya secures for himself (the benefits of) all sacrificial rites,
all ish*t*is, even the spoon-offerings; and instituted by the gods, in
truth, is that ish*t*i, the Âgraya*n*esh*t*i: 'May this also be offered
by me! May I be consecrated by this (offering) also!' thus he thinks,
and therefore he performs the offering of first-fruits. Moreover, it is
for the plants that he who is consecrated, is consecrated; therefore he
now makes the plants healthy and faultless, thinking, 'May I be
consecrated for (the obtainment of) healthy, faultless plants (crops)!'
A cow is the fee for this (offering).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:3:10">5:2:3:10</span></span>10.
Thereupon he performs the Seasonal offerings <span
id="fr_108"></span>[3](#fn_108.md); for verily he who performs the
Râ*g*asûya secures for himself (the benefits of) all sacrificial

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

rites, all ish*t*is, even the spoon-offerings; and instituted by the
gods, in truth, is that sacrificial rite, the Seasonal offerings: 'May
these also be offered by me! May I be consecrated by these (offerings)
also!' thus he thinks, and therefore he performs the Seasonal offerings.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_98"></span>[42:1](sbe4110.htm#fr_98.md) On the pûr*n*âhuti, or
libation of a spoonful of ghee, see part i, p. 302 note. According to
Kâty. *S*r. XV, 1, 4 seq. Â*s*v. *S*r. IX, 3, 2, and other authorities,
this full-offering is preceded by the Pavitra (purificatory ceremony), a
Soma-sacrifice with four dikshâs or initiation days (? commencing on the
first day of the bright fortnight of Phâlguna), serving as the ordinary
opening offering (anvârambha*n*îyesh*t*i). That it formed part of the
ceremonial .at the time of the composition of the Brâhma*n*a there can
be little doubt (cf. Pa*ñk*av. Br. 18, 8. 1), but as it is an ordinary
Agnish*t*oma, the author had no reason to refer to it.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[42:2](sbe4110.htm#fr_99.md) I. e. the approval or
favour of the deities, personified,--According to Yâ*gñ*ika Deva (to
Kâty. *S*r. XV, 1, 8), the ceremonies now beginning would commence on
the 10th day of the bright half of Phalgunî: the fifth day's ceremony
from this day, viz. the first of the four seasonal offerings, having to
be performed on the Full-moon of that month; see [p. 47](#page_47.md), note
[1](sbe4111.htm#fn_109.md).

<span id="fn_100"></span>[43:1](sbe4110.htm#fr_100.md) The authorities of
the Black Ya*g*us prepare therewith a cake on one kapâla. Taitt. S. I,
8, 1.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[43:2](sbe4110.htm#fr_101.md) Sâya*n*a, perhaps
rightly, takes 'iri*n*a' here (and on Taitt. S. vol. ii, p. 6) in the
sense of 'ûshara,' a spot of barren (or saline) soil. Cf. VII, 2; 1, 8:
'In whatever part of this (earth) there is produced (of itself) a cleft,
or in whatever part of it plants are not produced, verily that part of
it Nir*ri*ti seizes upon.'--Kau*s*ika-sûtra XIII, 28 (A. Weber, Omina
and Portenta, p. 386) recommends the following propitiatory rites in
case of a sudden cleft in the ground: 'If in the village, or house, or
fire-house, or meeting-place, (the ground) should burst open, four cows
are got ready, a white, a black, a red, and a one-coloured one. For
twelve days he puts down the butter, milked together from these. In the
morning of the twelfth, having made up a fire north of where there was
that cleft, having swept and sprinkled it, and strewn sacrificial grass
around it; and having mixed (the butter) with ghee from the white (cow),
and addressed it (the spot) with the three verses, Ath.-veda XII, x,
19-21 ("Agni is in the earth, in the plants, the waters carry Agni, Agni
is in the flints, Agni is within men; in cows, in horses are Agnis,"
&c.), and touched it, let him then offer. In the same way on the south
side; in the same way on the western side. Having concluded on the north
side, let him offer with the (formulas addressed) to Vâstoshpati (the
tutelary genius of the dwelling). Having poured the refuse in the cleft,
and completed the oblations, he sprinkles the cleft with lustral water.'

<span id="fn_102"></span>[44:1](sbe4110.htm#fr_102.md) Though he has
offered twice (to Nir*ri*ti and Anumati), he has only once taken out
rice for oblation.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[44:2](sbe4110.htm#fr_103.md) Viz. at the ordinary
Soma-sacrifice; for the Dîksha*n*îyesh*t*i, see part ii, p. 22.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[45:1](sbe4110.htm#fr_104.md) On the
identification of V*ri*tra with the moon (and Soma), see I, 6, 3, 27. On
the moon serving as food to the gods, see part ii, Introduction, p.
xiii. According to a later conception, one kalâ (or sixteenth part of
the moon's disc) was taken off each day during the period of the waning,
and again added to it during the period of the waxing moon.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[45:2](sbe4110.htm#fr_105.md) Utsar*g*am . . .
ghnanti; perhaps the former has to be taken here as infinitive (in order
to set him at liberty) rather than as gerund.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[46:1](sbe4110.htm#fr_106.md) Cp. I, 1, 2, 9,
'(Like) fire, verily, is the yoke of that cart: hence the shoulder of
those (oxen) that draw it becomes as if burnt by fire.'

<span id="fn_107"></span>[46:2](sbe4110.htm#fr_107.md) For the
Âgraya*n*esh*t*i, see part i, p. 369 seq.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[46:3](sbe4110.htm#fr_108.md) For the four
*K*âturmâsya (enumerated in the next chapter), see part i, p. 383 seq.
