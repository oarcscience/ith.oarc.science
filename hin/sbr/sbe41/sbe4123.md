### FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:1:1">5:5:1:1</span></span>1. There
is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni: this he places on the eastern
part (of the Vedi). There is either a cake on eleven potsherds for
Indra, or a rice-pap for Soma: this he places on the southern part.
There is a pap for the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* (All-gods): this he places on the
western part. There is a dish of curds for Mitra-Varu*n*a: this he
places on the north part. There is a pap for B*ri*haspati: this he
places in the middle. This is the five-holed pap <span
id="fr_236"></span>[1](#fn_236);--what five sacrificial dishes (havis)
there are, for them there are five holes: hence the name 'five-holed
pap.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:1:2">5:5:1:2</span></span>2. And as
to why the performer of the Râ*g*asûya should perform this offering:
because he (the priest) makes him ascend the regions, the seasons, the
hymns and metres, he now redeems him therefrom by this (offering). But
were the performer of the Râ*g*asûya not to perform this offering, then
verily he would become intoxicated (with pride) <span
id="fr_237"></span>[2](#fn_237) and would fall down headlong: that is
why the performer of the Râ*g*asûya performs this offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:1:3">5:5:1:3</span></span>3. And
why he proceeds with the cake on eight

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

potsherds for Agni,--because he makes him ascend the eastern region, the
seasons, the hymns and metres, he now redeems him therefrom by this
(oblation). The remains of it he pours on the B*ri*haspati pap.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:1:4">5:5:1:4</span></span>4. And
why he proceeds with the cake on eleven potsherds for Indra, or with the
pap for Soma,--because he makes him ascend the southern region, the
seasons, the hymns and metres, he now redeems him therefrom by this
(oblation). The remains he pours on the B*ri*haspati pap.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:1:5">5:5:1:5</span></span>5. And
why he proceeds with the pap to the All-gods,--because he makes him
ascend the eastern region, the seasons, the hymns and metres, he now
redeems him therefrom by this (oblation). The remains he pours on the
B*ri*haspati pap.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:1:6">5:5:1:6</span></span>6. And
why he proceeds with the dish of curds for Mitra-Varu*n*a,--because he
makes him ascend the northern region, the seasons, the hymns and metres,
he now redeems him therefrom by this (oblation). The remains he pours on
the B*ri*haspati pap. And in that he pours those remains on the
B*ri*haspati pap, he thereby bestows food upon him <span
id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_238) (the Sacrificer); and hence food is
brought to the king from every quarter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:1:7">5:5:1:7</span></span>7. And
why he proceeds with the B*ri*haspati pap,--because he makes him ascend
the upper region, the seasons, the hymns and metres, he now redeems him
therefrom by this (oblation).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:1:8">5:5:1:8</span></span>8. And
what cake on eight potsherds there is for Agni, the priest's fee for
that is gold; for that offering is for Agni, and gold is Agni's seed:
therefore

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

the fee is gold. He gives it to the Agnîdh; for he, the Âgnîdhra, is
really the same as Agni: therefore he gives it to the Agnîdh.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:1:9">5:5:1:9</span></span>9. And
what cake on eleven potsherds there is for Indra, the fee for that is a
bull, for the bull is Indra. And if there be a pap for Soma, then the
fee for that is a brown ox, for the brown one is sacred to Soma. He
gives it to the Brahman, for the Brahman guards the sacrifice from the
south: therefore he gives it to the Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:1:10">5:5:1:10</span></span>10. And
what pap there is for the All-gods, the fee for that is a piebald
bullock; for abundance of forms (marks) there is in such a piebald
bullock, and the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* are the clans, and the clans mean
abundance: therefore a piebald bullock is the fee. He gives it to the
Hot*ri*, for the Hot*ri* means abundance: therefore he gives it to the
Hot*ri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:1:11">5:5:1:11</span></span>11. And
what dish of curds there is for Mitra-Varu*n*a, the fee for that is a
sterile cow, for that one is sacred to Mitra-Varu*n*a. If he cannot
procure a sterile cow, any unimpregnated one will do; for every sterile
cow is indeed unimpregnated. He gives it to the two Adhvaryus; for the
Adhvaryus are the out-breathing and the in-breathing, and the
out-breathing and in-breathing are Mitra-Varu*n*a: therefore he gives it
to the two Adhvaryus.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:1:12">5:5:1:12</span></span>12. And
what pap there is for B*ri*haspati, the fee for that is a white-backed
bullock; for to B*ri*haspati belongs that upper region <span
id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_239), and above that there is that path of
Aryaman <span id="fr_240"></span>[2](#fn_240): therefore a white-backed
(bullock) is the fee for the B*ri*haspati (pap). He gives it to the
Brahman, for B*ri*haspati is the

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brahman of the
gods, and this one is his (the Sacrificer's) Brahman: therefore he gives
it to the Brahman. Even a vish*th*âvrâ*g*in <span
id="fr_241"></span>[1](#fn_241) who is desirous of food may perform this
offering: he (the priest) thereby bestows food upon him from all
quarters, and verily he becomes an eater of food.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_236"></span>[120:1](sbe4123.htm#fr_236) According to
Sâya*n*a (MS. I. O. 657) the term 'Pa*ñk*abila' is derived from the
circumstance that the vessel (pâtrî) on which the five sacrificial
dishes are placed when taken about to be 'deposited' on the vedi,
contains five holes or openings for the dishes to be taken out. The
Pa*ñk*abila oblations are to be performed during the light fortnight
succeeding the performance of the Da*s*apeya,--that is to say, during
the fortnight commencing with the new moon of Vai*s*âkha, or in the
latter part of April. The Taittirîya ceremonial calls these oblations
the 'Di*s*âm avesh*t*aya*h*,' i.e. 'Sacrifices performed for the
appeasement of the regions.'

<span id="fn_237"></span>[120:2](sbe4123.htm#fr_237) Or, would become
giddy (in flying through space), cf. Taitt. Br. I, 8, 3, 1.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[121:1](sbe4123.htm#fr_238) Or, puts food into
him.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[122:1](sbe4123.htm#fr_239) Or rather, that
upward direction.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[122:2](sbe4123.htm#fr_240) That is, the region
of light, of the sun. See [V, 3, 1, 2](sbe4113.htm#5:3:1:2) with note.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[123:1](sbe4123.htm#fr_241) The meaning of this
compound is unknown. Sâya*n*a explains it as meaning 'one who does not
move from one spot, one who always remains in one and the same place.'
Hence the St. Petersburg dictionary conjectures: 'One whose herd (or
cattle-pen, vra*g*a, vrâ*g*a) is stationary.' Similarly, Prof. Weber, in
Böhtlingk's Dictionary. See, however, the Kâ*n*va reading above, [p.
50](sbe4111.htm#page_50), note [1](sbe4111.htm#fn_115), according to
which the word would seem to mean one afflicted with a certain malady (?
cholera or dysentery). The 'Pa*ñk*abila' offering may be performed as a
special ish*t*i, independently of the Râ*g*asûya.
