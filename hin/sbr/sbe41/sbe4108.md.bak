### SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:1">5:2:1:1</span></span>1.
Thereupon, taking the clipping-spoon (sruva) and the pot for melting
butter, he goes to the Âhavanîya fire. He either offers those twelve
âptis <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72), or makes (the Sacrificer.md)
pronounce (the

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

formulas). Whether he offers, or makes him pronounce (the formulas), the
significance is the same.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:2">5:2:1:2</span></span>2. He
offers, with (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 20), 'To the ally, hail!--To the good ally,
hail!--To the after-born, hail!--To the purpose, hail!--To the Vasu,
hail!--To the Lord of day, hail!--To the failing day, hail!--To the
failing one, sprung from the evanescent, hail!--To the evanescent one,
sprung from the terminal, hail!--To the terminal descendant of being,
hail!--To the Lord of being, hail!--To the over-lord, hail!' These
twelve âptis (obtainments) he offers, because there are twelve months in
the year, and Pra*g*âpati is the year, and the sacrifice is Pra*g*âpati:
hence whatever obtainment, whatever accomplishment there is for
him <span id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73.md), that he thereby wins, that he
makes his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:3">5:2:1:3</span></span>3. He
then either offers six k*li*ptis <span id="fr_74"></span>[2](#fn_74.md), or
makes (the Sacrificer) pronounce them. Whether he offers, or makes him
pronounce them, the significance is the same.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:4">5:2:1:4</span></span>4. He
makes him pronounce (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 21), 'May the life prosper through
sacrifice!--May the breath prosper through sacrifice!--May the eye
prosper through sacrifice!--May the ear prosper through sacrifice!--May
the back prosper through sacrifice!--May the sacrifice

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

prosper through sacrifice!' These six k*li*ptis he makes him pronounce,
because there are six seasons in the year, and Pra*g*âpati is the year,
and the sacrifice is Pra*g*âpati: thus whatever success, whatever
accomplishment there is for him, that he thereby wins, that he makes his
own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:5">5:2:1:5</span></span>5. The
sacrificial post is eight-cornered; for the Gâyatrî metre has eight
syllables, and the Gâyatrî is Agni's metre: he thereby wins the world of
the gods. The post is either wrapt up, or bound up, in seventeen cloths;
for Pra*g*âpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:6">5:2:1:6</span></span>6. There
is a wheaten head-piece <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md) on it; for
man is nearest to Pra*g*âpati, and he is skinless <span
id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_76.md). And among plants wheat comes nearest to
man, (for) it has no skin: thus he thereby wins the world of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:7">5:2:1:7</span></span>7. The
post has a hollow (at the top), and is not pointed at the end; for the
hollow is sacred to the Fathers: he thus gains the world of the Fathers.
It is seventeen cubits long, for Pra*g*âpati is seventeen-fold: he thus
wins Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:8">5:2:1:8</span></span>8.
Thereupon the Nesh*tri*, being about to lead up the (Sacrificer's) wife,
makes her wrap round herself, over the garment of consecration, a cloth,
or skirt, made of Ku*s*a grass <span id="fr_77"></span>[3](#fn_77.md); for
she, the wife, is the hind

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

part of the sacrifice <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78.md); and he wishes
her, thus coming forward, to propitiate the sacrifice. But impure is
that part of woman which is below the navel, and pure are the plants of
(Ku*s*a) grass: thus having, by means of those plants of (Ku*s*a) grass,
made pure whatever part of her is impure, he causes her to propitiate
the sacrifice, while coming forward. This is why the Nesh*tri*, being
about to lead up the wife, makes her wrap round herself, over the
garment of consecration, a cloth, or skirt, made of Ku*s*a grass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:9">5:2:1:9</span></span>9. He
then leans a ladder (against the post). He may ascend either from the
south northwards, or from the north southwards; but let him rather
ascend from the south northwards (udak), for thus it goes upwards
(udak).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:10">5:2:1:10</span></span>10.
Being about to ascend, he (the Sacrificer) addresses his wife, 'Come,
wife, ascend we the sky!'--'Ascend we!' says the wife. Now as to why he
addresses his wife: she, the wife, in sooth is one half of his own self;
hence, as long as he does not obtain her, so long he is not regenerated,
for so long he is incomplete. But as soon as he obtains her he is
regenerated, for then he is complete. 'Complete I want to go to that
supreme goal,' thus (he thinks) and therefore he addresses his wife.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:11">5:2:1:11</span></span>11. He
ascends, with, 'We have become Pra*g*âpati's children;' for he who
offers the Vâ*g*apeya indeed becomes Pra*g*âpati's child:

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:12">5:2:1:12</span></span>12. He
then touches the wheat (top-piece) <span id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_79.md),
with,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'We have gone to
the light, O ye gods!' for he who offers the Vâ*g*apeya, indeed goes to
the light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:13">5:2:1:13</span></span>13. And
as to why he touches the wheat: wheat is food, and he who offers the
Vâ*g*apeya, wins food, for vâ*g*a-peya is the same as anna-peya (food
and drink): thus whatever food he has thereby won, therewith now that he
has gone to that supreme goal, he puts himself in contact, and possesses
himself of it,--therefore he touches the wheat (top-piece).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:14">5:2:1:14</span></span>14. He
then rises by (the measure of) his head over the post, with, 'We have
become immortal!' whereby he wins the world of the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:15">5:2:1:15</span></span>15.
Thereupon, while looking in the different directions, he mutters (Vâ*g*.
S. IX, 22), 'Ours be your power, ours your manhood and intelligence ours
be your energies!' For he who offers the Vâ*g*apeya wins everything
here, winning as he does Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati being everything
here;--having appropriated to himself the glory, the power, and the
strength of this All, he now lays them within himself, makes them his
own: that is why he mutters, while looking in the different directions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:16">5:2:1:16</span></span>16.
They throw up to him bags of salt; for salt means cattle, and cattle is
food; and he who offers the [Vâ*g*apeya](errata.htm#5.md) wins food, for
vâ*g*a-peya is the same as anna-peya: thus whatever food he thereby has
gained, therewith now that he has gone to the supreme goal, he puts
himself in contact, and makes it his own,--therefore they throw bags of
salt up to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:17">5:2:1:17</span></span>17.
They (the pieces of salt) are done up in a*s*vattha

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (ficus religiosa)
leaves: because Indra on that (former) occasion called upon the Maruts
staying on the A*s*vattha tree <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md),
therefore they are done up in a*s*vattha leaves. Peasants (vi*s*) throw
them up to him, for the Maruts are the peasants, and the peasants are
food (for the nobleman): hence peasants throw them up. There are
seventeen (bags), for Pra*g*âpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins
Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:18">5:2:1:18</span></span>18.
Thereupon; while looking down upon this (earth), he mutters, Homage be
to the mother Earth! homage be to the mother Earth!' For when
B*ri*haspati had been consecrated, the Earth was afraid of him,
thinking, 'Something great surely has he become now that he has been
consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder <span
id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_81.md)!' And B*ri*haspati also was afraid of the
Earth, thinking, 'I fear lest she may shake me off!' Hence by that
(formula) he entered into a friendly relation with her; for a mother
does not hurt her son, nor does a son hurt his mother.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:19">5:2:1:19</span></span>19. Now
the [B*ri*haspati consecration](errata.htm#6.md) <span
id="fr_82"></span>[3](#fn_82.md) is the same as the Vâ*g*apeya; and the
earth in truth is afraid of that (Sacrificer), thinking, 'Something
great

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

surely has he become now that he has been consecrated: I fear lest he
may rend me asunder!' And he himself is afraid of her, thinking, 'I fear
lest she may shake me off!' Hence he thereby enters into a friendly
relation with her, for a mother does not hurt her son; neither does a
son hurt his mother.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:20">5:2:1:20</span></span>20. He
then descends (and treads) upon a piece of gold;--gold is immortal life:
he thus takes his stand on life immortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:21">5:2:1:21</span></span>21. Now
(in the first place) he (the Adhvaryu) spreads out the skin of a
he-goat, and lays a (small) gold plate thereon: upon that--or indeed
upon this (earth) itself--he (the Sacrificer) steps.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:22">5:2:1:22</span></span>22.
They then bring a throne-seat for him; for truly he who gains a seat in
the air <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md), gains a seat above
(others): thus these subjects of his sit below him who is seated
above,--this is why they bring him a throne-seat.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:23">5:2:1:23</span></span>23. It
is made of udumbara wood,--the Udumbara tree being sustenance, (that is)
food,--for his obtainment of sustenance, food: therefore it is made of
udumbara wood. They set it down in front of the Havirdhâna (cart-shed),
behind the Âhavanîya (fire).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:24">5:2:1:24</span></span>24. He
then spreads the goat-skin thereon; for truly the he-goat is no other
than Pra*g*âpati, for they, the goats, are most clearly of Pra*g*âpati
(the lord of generation or creatures);--whence, bringing forth thrice in
a year, they produce two or three <span id="fr_84"></span>[2](#fn_84.md):
thus he thereby makes him (the Sacrificer) to be Pra*g*âpati
himself,--this is why he spreads the goat-skin thereon.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:1:25">5:2:1:25</span></span>25. He
spreads it, with, 'This is thy kingship <span
id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85.md)!' whereby he endows him with royal power.
He then makes him sit down, with, Thou art the ruler, the ruling lord!'
whereby he makes him the ruler, ruling over those subjects of his Thou
art firm, and stedfast!' whereby he makes him firm and stedfast in this
world;--'Thee for the tilling!--Thee for peaceful dwelling!--Thee for
wealth!--Thee for thrift!' whereby he means to say, '(here I seat) thee
for the welfare (of the people).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_72"></span>[29:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_72.md) The term âpti,
literally 'obtainment, gain,' is technically used <span id="page_30">p.
30</span> for the twelve formulas, given in the next paragraph, as well
as for the oblations made therewith. The first of these formulas is
'âpaye svâhâ,' whence the above term is probably derived.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[30:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_73.md) Or perhaps, 'there is
of (belongs to) that (sacrifice).'

<span id="fn_74"></span>[30:2](sbe4108.htm#fr_74.md) This term, literally
'success, accomplishment,' is technically used to denote the succeeding
formulas containing the verb 'k*li*p,' to succeed, prosper, as well as
the oblations made therewith.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[31:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_75.md) For the ordinary
mortar-shaped top-piece fixed on the post. see-part ii, p. 168, note 1.
On the present occasion it is to be made of wheaten dough.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[31:2](sbe4108.htm#fr_76.md) According to a legend
given at III, 1, 2, 13 seq., man had originally a (hairy) skin, or hide;
but the gods having flayed him, put his skin on the cow.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[31:3](sbe4108.htm#fr_77.md) In the ceremonial of
the Black Ya*g*us (Taitt. Br. I. 3, 7, 1) the Sacrificer himself has to
put on a 'târpya' garment, for which see note on [V, 2, 5,
20](sbe4117.htm#5:3:5:20) (sic.md).

<span id="fn_78"></span>[32:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_78.md) Viz. because her
ordinary seat is at the back, or west, end of the altar.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[32:2](sbe4108.htm#fr_79.md) According to the
ritual of the Black Ya*g*us (Sây. on Taitt. S. I, 7, 9, vol. i, p.
1039), the Sacrificer, having ascended, lifts up his <span
id="page_33">p. 33</span> arms to heaven, praying, 'We have gone to the
light, to the gods, we have become immortal; we have become
Pra*g*âpati's children!'

<span id="fn_80"></span>[34:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_80.md) See part ii, p. 334,
with note 2. On the 'a*s*vattha devasadana' cp. also Ath.-veda V, 4, 3;
Rig-veda I, 164, 20-22; A. Kuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers and des
Göttertranks, p. 126 seq. (Mythol. Stud. i. p. 112 seq.).

<span id="fn_81"></span>[34:2](sbe4108.htm#fr_81.md) Or, 'I hope he will
not rend me asunder.' For this construction--exactly corresponding to
the German 'dass (or, wenn) er mich nur nicht aufreisst!' (cf. also the
colloquial use of the French 'pourvu,'--'pourvu qu’il ne me déchire
pas!')--see part ii, p. 31, note 1.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[34:3](sbe4108.htm#fr_82.md) The B*ri*haspatisava
is performed by a Brâhma*n*a with a view to obtaining the office of
Purohita (royal chaplain, or family priest). For Â*s*valâyana's rule,
which places it on a level with the Râ*g*asûya sacrifice of a king, see
[p. 4](sbe4103.htm#page_4), note [1](sbe4103.htm#fn_33.md).

<span id="fn_83"></span>[35:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_83.md) The Sacrificer is
supposed to have done so by the, symbolical act of raising his head
above the sacrificial post; see paragraph 14 above.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[35:2](sbe4108.htm#fr_84.md) See IV, 5, 5, 6; part
ii, p. 407, note 3.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[36:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_85.md) Thus the formula 'iyam
to râ*t*' is interpreted by Mahîdhara (who, however, takes it to be
addressed to the throne-seat, and not, as would seem preferable, to the
king), and apparently also by our author. The word 'râ*g*' would indeed
seem to mean here something like the energy (*s*akti), or the symbol, of
the king. The St. Petersburg dictionary, however, takes it here as the
name of a female deity.
