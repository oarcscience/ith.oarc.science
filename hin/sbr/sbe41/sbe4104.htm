<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:2:4">5:1:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. He then draws those five V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya cups (for Indra; the first) with the text (V. S. IX, 2), 'Thee, the firm-seated, the man-seated, the mind-seated! Thou art taken with a support&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: I take thee, agreeable to Indra!

Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for among these worlds that ether (mentioned in the formula) is this air: he thereby wins this air-world.</p>

[The third with,] 'Thee, the earth-seated, the air-seated, the sky-seated, the god-seated, the heaven-seated! Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for god-seated, heaven-seated indeed is yonder world of the gods: the world of the gods he thereby wins.</p>

Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for the waters&#8217; essence is he that blows (or purifies) yonder (the wind), and he is contained in the sun, he blows from the sun: that same essence he thereby wins.</p>

These, then, are five V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya cups he draws; for he who offers the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya wins Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati; and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the year, and there are five seasons in the year,--he thus wins Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati: therefore he draws five V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya cups.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:2:10">5:1:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. He (the Adhvaryu) then draws seventeen (other) cups of Soma, and (the Nesh<I>t</I><I>ri</I>) seventeen cups of Sur&acirc; (spirituous liquor), for to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati belong these two (saps of) plants, to wit the Soma and the Sur&acirc;;--and of these two the Soma is truth, prosperity, light; and the Sur&acirc; untruth, misery, darkness: both these (saps of) plants he thereby wins; for he who offers the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya wins everything here, since he wins Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati indeed is everything here.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:2:11">5:1:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. Now as to why he draws seventeen cups of Soma;--Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is seventeenfold, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>its measure, with that much he thus wins its truth, its prosperity, its light.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:2:12">5:1:2:12</A></FONT></span>12. And why he draws seventeen cups of Sur&acirc;;--Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is seventeenfold, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the sacrifice: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is its measure, with that much he thus wins its untruth, its misery, its darkness.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:2:13">5:1:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. These two amount to thirty-four cups; for there are thirty-three gods, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the thirty-fourth: he thus wins Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:2:14">5:1:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. Now when he buys the king (Soma), he at the same time buys for a piece of lead the Parisrut (immature spirituous liquor) from a long-haired man near by towards the south. For a long-haired man is neither man nor woman; for, being a male, he is not a woman; and being long-haired (a eunuch), he is not a man. And that lead is neither iron nor gold; and the Parisrut-liquor is neither Soma nor Sur&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: this is why he buys the Parisrut for a piece of lead from a long-haired man.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:2:15">5:1:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. And on the preceding day they prepare two</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_10"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>earth-mounds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the one in front of the axle, and the other behind the axle: 'Lest we should deposit together the cups of Soma, and the cups of Sur&acirc;,'--this is why, on the preceding day, they prepare two mounds, one in front, and the other behind the axle.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:2:16">5:1:2:16</A></FONT></span>16. Now, when they take the Vasat&icirc;var&icirc; water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (into the havirdh&acirc;na shed) by the front door, the Nesh<I>t</I><I>ri</I> takes in the Parisrut-liquor by the back door. From the south they bring in the drinking vessels. The Adhvaryu, seated in front of the axle, with his face towards the west, draws the cups of Soma; and the Nesh<I>t</I><I>ri</I>, seated behind the axle, with his face towards the east, draws the cups of Sur&acirc;. The Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, the Nesh<I>t</I><I>ri</I> a cup of Sur&acirc;; the Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, the Nesh<I>t</I><I>ri</I> a cup of Sur&acirc;: in this way they draw them alternately.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:2:17">5:1:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. Neither does the Adhvaryu hold the Soma-cup beyond the axle towards the back, nor the Nesh<I>t</I><I>ri</I> the Sur&acirc;-cup beyond the axle towards the front, thinking, 'Lest we should confound light and darkness!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:2:18">5:1:2:18</A></FONT></span>18. The Adhvaryu holds the Soma-cup just over the axle, and the Nesh<I>t</I><I>ri</I> the Sur&acirc;-cup just below</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_11"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the axle, with (V. S. IX, 4), 'United ye are: unite me with happiness!' Thinking, 'Lest we should say "evil",' they withdraw them again, with, 'Disunited ye are: disunite me from evil!' Even as one might tear a single reed from a clump of reed-grass, so do they thereby tear him from out of all evil: there is not in him so much sin as the point of a grass-blade. They deposit the two (cups each time on the mounds).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:2:19">5:1:2:19</A></FONT></span>19. Thereupon the Adhvaryu draws the Madhu-graha (honey-cup) in a golden vessel, and deposits it in the middle of the Soma-grahas. He then draws the Ukthya, then the Dhruva. And when, at the last chant (of the evening press feast&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>), he has poured those Soma-grahas one by one into the cups of the officiating priests, they make offering and drink them.

<P><A NAME="fn_35"></A><A HREF="sbe4104.htm#fr_35">5:1</A> Regarding this cup, or libation (consisting, it would seem, of imperfectly pressed Soma-plants in water), see part ii, p. 424, note 1. Here, and in the sequel, the author only refers to those points of ceremonial in which the performance differs from that of the ordinary Agnish<I>t</I>oma sacrifice, as described in part ii.</P>

See IV, 5, 4, 24. The authorities of the Black Ya<I>g</I>us adopt a somewhat different arrangement. The V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya cups are likewise called by them Atigr&acirc;hyas (Taitt. S. I, 7, 22; T. B. I, 3, 9), and these are apparently drawn by them immediately after the second of the ordinary three Atigr&acirc;hyas, the one belonging to Indra (T. S. vol. i, p. 996,--but see ib. p. 1955, where it is stated that they are drawn immediately after the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a,--that is, probably, if the ordinary Atigr&acirc;hyas are not required). Then follows (the third ordinary Atigr&acirc;hya?), then the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in, and thereupon the seventeen cups for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.--S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a remarks on our passage,--tesh&acirc;m (atigr&acirc;hy&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;m) prak<I>ri</I>tigat&acirc; tritvasa<I>m</I>khyaiva <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;ntaravat sa<I>m</I>khy&acirc;ntar&acirc;nupade<I>s</I>&acirc;t. MS. I. O. 657.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_38"></A><A HREF="sbe4104.htm#fr_38">6:3</A> For an explanation of these notions, see part ii, p. 260, notes 1 and 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_39"></A><A HREF="sbe4104.htm#fr_39">8:1</A> See I, 5, 2, 17, where the principal formulas used in making oblations are computed as consisting together of seventeen syllables. Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>. Br. 18, 6 insists especially on the symbolic identity of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati and the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya on the double ground that the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya consists of seventeen stotras, and has for its characteristic mode of chanting the Saptada<I>s</I>a-stoma, or seventeen-versed hymn. That this is indeed so will appear from a glance at the chief chants. The Bahishpavam&acirc;na-stotra, which in the ordinary Agnish<I>t</I>oma is chanted in the triv<I>ri</I>t-stoma, consisting of three triplets, or nine verses (see part ii, p. 310), is at the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya made to consist of seventeen verses, by the insertion of eight verses (S.V. II, 180-82; 186-90) between the second and third triplets. Again, the M&acirc;dhyandina-pavam&acirc;na, ordinarily chanted in fifteen verses (part ii, p. 333), here consists of seventeen, viz. II, 105-7 (sung twice in two tunes = six verses); II, 663 (one verse); II, 663-4 (sung as triplet, in two tunes = six verses); <A HREF="errata.htm#3">II, 663, in a different tune again</A> (one verse); II, 821-23 <A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A> (three verses)--making together seventeen verses. Similarly, the &Acirc;rbhava-pavam&acirc;na (chanted at the Agnish<I>t</I>oma also in the Saptada<I>s</I>a-stoma, cf. part ii, p. 315; but here with modifications) consists of II, 165-7 (sung twice in two tunes = six verses); II, 42, 44 (two verses); II, 47-9 (in two tunes = six verses); <A HREF="errata.htm#4">II, 720-22</A> (three verses)--making together seventeen verses. For the similarly constructed V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya hymn see page 11, note 1. See also L&acirc;<I>t</I>y. <I>S</I>r. VIII, 11, 15 seq., where the number of officiating priests, as well as that of the various sacrificial fees, is fixed at seventeen. Similarly, &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>r. IX, 9, 2-3 says that there are either to be seventeen diksh&acirc;s, or the whole ceremony is to be performed in seventeen days.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_40"></A><A HREF="sbe4104.htm#fr_40">9:1</A> According to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, the difference between sur&acirc; and parisrut would seem to be that the former beverage is prepared from mature shoots (of rice, &amp;c.), and the latter from such as are not quite ripe.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_41"></A><A HREF="sbe4104.htm#fr_41">10:1</A> The mounds (khara) thrown up in the havirdh&acirc;na cart-shed, are used for placing the cups of Soma (and Sur&acirc;) after they are drawn, until they are used for the libations. See the plan of the sacrificial ground at the end of part ii; only that on the present occasion there is to be a second mound, for the placing of the Sur&acirc;-cups, under or just behind the axle of the southern Soma-cart (in the place where the N&acirc;r&acirc;<I>s</I>a<I>m</I>sa cups to the Fathers were temporarily deposited at the Agnish<I>t</I>oma; see III, 6, 2, 25 with note). On this occasion a small door is also made in the southern wall of the cart-shed, by breaking through the hurdle.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_42"></A><A HREF="sbe4104.htm#fr_42">10:2</A> Part ii, p. 222 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_43"></A><A HREF="sbe4104.htm#fr_43">11:1</A> The last chant (at the evening feast) of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya sacrifice is the so-called V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya-s&acirc;man, or B<I>ri</I>hat-stotra (S&acirc;mav. II, 975-7), chanted, to the B<I>ri</I>hat tune, in the Saptada<I>s</I>a-stoma; the three verses being, by repetitions, raised to the number of seventeen.--'When he has poured . . . they offer it:' this is apparently a case of the absolute construction of the gerund in '-ya,' cf.
