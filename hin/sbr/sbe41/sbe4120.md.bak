### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:1">5:4:3:1</span></span>1. North
of the Âhavanîya he places a hundred, or more than a hundred, cows of
that relative of his. The reason why he does so is this:

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:2">5:4:3:2</span></span>2. When
Varu*n*a was consecrated, his energy, his vigour departed from him.
Probably <span id="fr_194"></span>[2](#fn_194.md) that collected essence
(life-sap) of the waters wherewith they were sprinkling him, drove out
his energy, his vigour. He found it in the cattle, and because he found
it in them, therefore cattle are an object of respect. And having found
it in the cattle, he again took to himself his energy, his vigour. And
in like manner this one;--that energy does not indeed depart from him,
but he does it (thinking), 'This Râ*g*asûya is Varu*n*a's consecration,
and Varu*n*a did so.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:3">5:4:3:3</span></span>3. He
takes down the chariot (from the stand <span
id="fr_195"></span>[3](#fn_195).md); for whatever turns away from the
warrior (râ*g*anya) that he overtakes with his chariot: for this reason
he takes down the chariot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:4">5:4:3:4</span></span>4. He
takes it down with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 21), 'Thou art Indra's thunderbolt!'
The chariot is indeed a thunderbolt; and the Sacrificer is Indra;--he is
Indra for a twofold reason, namely because he is a

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kshatriya, and
because he is a Sacrificer: therefore he says, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou
art.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:5">5:4:3:5</span></span>5. Having
turned it (so as to stand) inside the Vedi, he yokes it with, 'I yoke
thee by the direction of Mitra and Varu*n*a, the directors <span
id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_196.md);' for Mitra and Varu*n*a are the two
arms, and by his arms the Râ*g*anya belongs to Mitra and Varu*n*a that
is why he says, 'I yoke thee by direction of Mitra and Varu*n*a, the
directors.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:6">5:4:3:6</span></span>6. He
yokes it with four (horses). He passes along by the same way as that on
which the dakshi*n*âs <span id="fr_197"></span>[2](#fn_197.md) go,--behind
the Sadas, and in front of the hall. He stops it behind the *k*âtvâla,
and in front of the Âgnîdhra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:7">5:4:3:7</span></span>7. He
mounts it with, 'For unfeebleness (I mount) thee, for svadhâ <span
id="fr_198"></span>[3](#fn_198) (I mount.md) thee!'--by 'for unfeebleness
thee' he means to say, 'for a state free from afflictions (I mount)
thee;' by 'for svadhâ thee' he means to say, 'for life-sap (I mount)
thee;'--'I, the unharmed Ar*g*una!' Now Indra is called Ar*g*una, which
is his mystic name; and this (king) is Indra for a twofold reason,
namely because he is a Kshatriya, and because he is a Sacrificer:
therefore he says, 'the unharmed Ar*g*una.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:8">5:4:3:8</span></span>8. He
then goads on the right yoke-horse, with, 'Conquer thou by the impulse
of the Maruts!' For the Maruts are the clansmen, and it is by his

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

clan that the chieftain wins what he desires to win: therefore he says,
'Conquer thou by the impulse of the Maruts!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:9">5:4:3:9</span></span>9. He
then stops (the chariot) in the midst of the cows <span
id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_199.md), with, 'May we obtain by the mind!' For
it is by the mind that everything here (that is obtained) is obtained;
and by the mind therefore he now obtains everything: therefore he says,
'May we obtain by the mind!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:10">5:4:3:10</span></span>10. He
then touches a cow with the end of the bow, with, 'Together with
energy!'--energy means vigour, kine: it is energy, vigour, he thereby
takes to himself. And he adds, 'I overpower them, I seize them!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:11">5:4:3:11</span></span>11. Now
as to why he stops amidst the cows of his relative,--whatever is tending
away from a man, be it either fame, or anything else, that passes over
to his relative foremost of all;--that energy, or vigour, he now takes
again from his relative to himself: that is why he stops amidst the cows
of his relative.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:12">5:4:3:12</span></span>12. In
return he presents to him just as many (cows) <span
id="fr_200"></span>[2](#fn_200.md), or more. For assuredly he, the
Sacrificer,

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

is not capable of a cruel deed; but cruelly indeed he acts when he says,
'I overpower them, I seize them;' and thus that is done by him without
cruelty: this is why, in return, he presents to him just as many (cows)
or more.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:13">5:4:3:13</span></span>13. He
then pulls the right-side (horses, or reins). He passes along on the
same way as that on which the dakshi*n*â (cows) go,--in front of the
sacrificial post, and along the south of the Vedi. Behind the Sadas, and
in front of the hall, he stops that (car).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:14">5:4:3:14</span></span>14.
\[Vâ*g*. S. X, 22\], 'Lest, O Indra, overpowerer of the mighty, we be
wanting thee, heedless through ungodliness,--mount thou, O divine
wielder of the thunderbolt, the chariot which thou restrainest (as well
as its) well-horsed reins <span id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_201.md).' With
this (verse) he stops (the chariot);--reins (ra*s*mi) means bridle
(abhî*s*u): therefore he says, 'Thou restrainest the well-horsed
reins <span id="fr_202"></span>[2](#fn_202.md)???.' Thereupon he offers the
(four oblations) relating to the unyoking of the chariot. 'Well-pleased
the chariot shall be when unyoked,' he thinks, and therefore he offers
the (oblations) relating to the unyoking of the chariot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:15">5:4:3:15</span></span>15. He
offers with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 23), 'To Agni, the House-lord, hail!' He
thereby pleases the part of the chariot relating to Agni; and it is the
shoulder-pieces of the chariot that relate to Agni it is the
shoulder-pieces (of the yoke) he thereby pleases. And the house-lord's
position means prosperity: as much as he (the king) rules over, for

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

the prosperity, the house-lordship, of that his kingship is thereby
rendered free (unopposed).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:16">5:4:3:16</span></span>16. 'To
Soma, the wood-lord (tree), hail!' There are two kinds of (objects)
coming from trees, the wheels of chariots and waggons, for both of these
he thereby ensures safety. And the wood-lord (tree) being
Soma,--whatever part of the chariot comes from the tree, that he thereby
pleases. Now the parts of the chariot coming from trees are the wooden
pieces of the chariot: hence it is the wooden pieces he thereby pleases.
And Soma being the nobility, it is over the nobility that his kingship
is thereby rendered free.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:17">5:4:3:17</span></span>17. 'To
the strength of the Maruts, hail!' He thereby pleases the part of the
chariot belonging to the Maruts,--there are four horses, the chariot the
fifth, and the warrior (chariot-fighter) and charioteer two--these are
seven, and the host of the Maruts consists of (troops of) seven each: he
thereby pleases the whole chariot; and the Maruts being the peasants, it
is over the peasantry that his kingship is thereby rendered free.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:18">5:4:3:18</span></span>18. 'To
Indra's energy, hail!' He thereby pleases the part of the chariot that
belongs to Indra. Now the warrior relates to Indra, and it is the
warrior he thereby pleases. And Indra's energy (indriya) means the
vigour in Indra <span id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_203.md): it is in regard
to energy, vigour, that his kingship is thereby rendered free.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:19">5:4:3:19</span></span>19. He
then puts on shoes of boar's skin. Now the gods once put a pot of ghee
on the fire. Therefrom a boar was produced: hence the boar is fat,

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

for it was produced from ghee. Hence also cows readily take to a boar:
it is indeed their own essence (life-sap, blood) they are readily taking
to. Thus he firmly establishes himself in the essence of the cattle:
therefore he puts on shoes of boar's skin.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:20">5:4:3:20</span></span>20.
Looking down on this (earth) he then mutters, 'O mother Earth, injure me
not, nor I thee!' For the Earth was once afraid of Varu*n*a, when he had
been consecrated, thinking, 'Something great surely has he become now
that he has been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder!' And
Varu*n*a also was afraid of the Earth, thinking, 'I fear lest she may
shake me off!' Hence by that (formula) he entered into a friendly
relation with her; for a mother does not injure her son, nor does a son
injure his mother.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:21">5:4:3:21</span></span>21. Now
this Râ*g*asûya is Varu*n*a's consecration; and the Earth is afraid of
him, thinking, 'Something great surely has he become now that he has
been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder!' And he also is
afraid of her, thinking, 'I fear lest she may shake me off.' Hence he
thereby enters into a friendly relation with her; for a mother does not
injure her son, nor does a son injure his mother: therefore he mutters
thus.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:22">5:4:3:22</span></span>22. He
steps down (from the chariot), muttering this ati*kh*andas verse (Vâ*g*.
S. X, 24; *Ri*k S. IV, 40, 5), 'The swan dwelling in the light, the Vasu
dwelling in the air, the priest seated on the altar, the guest dwelling
in the retreat (house),--the man-dwelling, the space-dwelling <span
id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_204.md), the law-dwelling, the sphere-dwelling,
the water-born,

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

cow-born, law-born, rock-born (is) the great [law](errata.htm#9.md).' For
that ati*kh*andas (or excessive metre) comprises all the metres: thus
evil does not descend along with him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:23">5:4:3:23</span></span>23. Let
not the charioteer get down along with (or, after) him, lest he should
descend on the same world on which the anointed (king) has just
descended. They put him up, along with the chariot, on the car-stand.
Thence he leaps down: thus he does not descend on the same world on
which the anointed has just descended <span
id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_205.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:24">5:4:3:24</span></span>24.
North of the Âhavanîya is the original fire, taken up (from the
hearth <span id="fr_206"></span>[2](#fn_206).md). Behind the right
hind-wheel of the cart-stand he fastens two round *s*atamânas <span
id="fr_207"></span>[3](#fn_207.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:25">5:4:3:25</span></span>25. He
then hides an udumbara (ficus glomerata) branch (in the wheel-track). He
touches one of those two (plates), with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 25), 'So great
thou art, life thou art: bestow life upon me! A yoke-mate thou art,
lustre thou art: bestow lustre upon me!' He thereby takes life and
lustre to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:26">5:4:3:26</span></span>26. He
then touches the udumbara branch, with, 'Sustenance thou art: bestow
sustenance upon me!' He thereby takes sustenance (strength) to himself.
Those same two round *s*atamânas are the fee for this ceremony. He gives
them to the

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brahman priest,
for the Brahman protects the sacrifice from the south: therefore he
gives them to the Brahman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:3:27">5:4:3:27</span></span>27. In
front of the Maitrâvaru*n*a's hearth the dish of curds for Mitra and
Varu*n*a has been deposited. He draws down to it his (the Sacrificer's)
two arms <span id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_208.md), with, 'I draw you down,
the arms of Indra, the doer of mighty deeds.' Now curds are the essence
of cattle: hence it is to the essence of cattle that he thereby brings
down his (the Sacrificer's) arms. And as to its being for
Mitra-Varu*n*a, it is because Mitra and Varu*n*a are the two arms.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_193"></span>[98:1](sbe4119.htm#fr_193.md) The meaning of krivi
(krayi, Taitt. S.) is doubtful. Mahîdhara derives it from 'kar' (to make
or injure), in the sense of either 'efficacious,' or 'destructive.'--A
Grantha MS. of the Kâ*n*va text reads kavi, 'wise.'

<span id="fn_194"></span>[98:2](sbe4120.htm#fr_194.md) I am now inclined to
think that some such meaning as 'probably, perhaps' (more nearly, German
'wohl'), fits all the passages (in the Brâhma*n*as at all events) where
*s*a*s*vat occurs.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[98:3](sbe4120.htm#fr_195.md) See above, [V, 1, 4,
3](sbe4106.htm#5:1:4:3.md) seq.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[99:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_196.md) Pra*s*âst*ri*, 'the
director,' is also another name for the Maitrâvaru*n*a priest.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[99:2](sbe4120.htm#fr_197.md) That is, the cows
given to priests as sacrificial fee. For particulars regarding the
passage by which they are driven to their destination, see part ii, p.
344, note 1.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[99:3](sbe4120.htm#fr_198.md) Probably here 'for
well-being;' the author, however, evidently takes it here in the sense
of 'invigorating potion,' the drink offered to the deceased ancestors.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[100:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_199.md) In the ceremonial
of the Black Ya*g*us a sham-fight takes place here. East or north of the
sacrificial ground a Râ*g*anya has posted himself with bow in hand. The
king discharges the arrows at him, with, 'Obtained is the mind!' and
having thus, as it were, overpowered the enemy, ne wheels round in a
sunwise direction, with, 'I (have become endowed) with energy, with
vigour!' He then puts on shoes of boar's skin, with, 'Thou art the
mettle of cattle,' gets down from the chariot, and puts on ornaments of
silver, copper (as Sâya*n*a here interprets audumbara), and gold
(afterwards to be given to the Brahman). Then follow the oblations
relating to the unyoking of the chariot. Taitt. S. I, 8, 15, with
commentary.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[100:2](sbe4120.htm#fr_200.md) Viz. as many as he
has taken from him, a hundred or more.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[101:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_201.md) For a different
version of this somewhat awkwardly constructed verse, see *Ri*k S. V,
33, 3.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[101:2](sbe4120.htm#fr_202.md) The explanation is
given because the word has also the meaning 'ray.'

<span id="fn_203"></span>[102:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_203.md) ? Or, means vigour,
Indra.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[103:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_204.md) Or perhaps, 'in the
best place (vara).' See [VI, 7, 3, 11](sbe4151.htm#6:7:3:11.md).

<span id="fn_205"></span>[104:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_205.md) According to Taitt.
Br. I, 7, 9, 6, the king, on returning to the Vedi, is supposed to have
ascended to the heavenly world (suvargaloka), from which the charioteer
is to be excluded by this expedient.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[104:2](sbe4120.htm#fr_206.md) The Âhavanîya of
the hall (the so-called 'hall-door fire') has been lifted and placed on
a cart.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[104:3](sbe4120.htm#fr_207.md) Or, two round
(gold) plates, weighing a hundred mina (or berries of Gu*ñg*â, or Abrus
Precatorius, the average weight of which is stated to be 1 5/16 grains
Troy).

<span id="fn_208"></span>[105:1](sbe4120.htm#fr_208.md) Whilst this is
done, the king stands on the tiger's skin, and the Adhvaryu hands him
his bow and arrows. Thereupon the dish of curds is taken to the
uttaravedi to be proceeded with. Kâty. *S*r. XV, 6, 34-35.
