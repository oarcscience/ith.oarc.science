#### THE KE*S*AVAPANÎYA.

### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:3:1">5:5:3:1</span></span>1. When
he has performed the Consecration-ceremony (Abhishe*k*anîya), he does
not shave his hair. The reason why he does not shave his hair (is
this):--that collected essence of the waters wherewith he is then
sprinkled (anointed) is vigour, and it is the hair (of his head) that it
reaches first when he is sprinkled; hence were he to shave his hair, he
would cause that glory to fall off from him, and would sweep it away:
therefore he does not shave his hair.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:3:2">5:5:3:2</span></span>2. He
does not shave his hair for a year <span
id="fr_249"></span>[1](#fn_249.md),--religious observance is of equal
measure with the year, hence he does not shave for a year: the
Ke*s*avapanîya <span id="fr_250"></span>[2](#fn_250.md), namely, is a (day
of) praise-singing

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (stoma) with the
view of the termination of the religious performance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:3:3">5:5:3:3</span></span>3.
Twenty-onefold is (each stotra of) its Morning-service, seventeenfold
(of) the Midday-service, fifteen-fold (of) the Evening-service, together
with the Uktha (stotras), the Sho*d*a*s*in, and (the twelve stotras of)
the Night-service.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:3:4">5:5:3:4</span></span>4. The
Twilight (hymn) <span id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_251.md) is (performed in
the) Triv*ri*t (stoma), and with the Rathantara (tune). For the
twenty-onefold (stoma) is he that burns yonder (the sun); from that
twenty-onefold one he (the Sacrificer) parts, and descends again to the
seventeenfold one; from the seventeenfold one to the

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

fifteenfold one; and from the fifteenfold one he plants his foot on this
firm footing, the Triv*ri*t (stoma).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:3:5">5:5:3:5</span></span>5. The
Rathantara is the P*ri*sh*th*a (stotra) <span
id="fr_252"></span>[1](#fn_252) of this (sacrifice.md); for the Rathantara
is this (earth): it is on her, as on a firm footing, he thereby plants
his feet. It is an Atirâtra (sacrifice),--the Atirâtra is a firm
footing: therefore it is an Atirâtra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:3:6">5:5:3:6</span></span>6. He
only cuts down his hair, but does not shave it; for that collected
essence of the waters with which he is sprinkled is vigour, and it is
the hair that it reaches first when he is sprinkled. Thus were he to
shave off his hair he would cause that glory to fall off from him, and
would sweep it away. But when he cuts it down, he attaches that glory to
his own self: therefore he only cuts down his hair, but does not shave
it. This is for him a religious observance: as long as he lives he does
not stand on this (earth with bare feet <span
id="fr_253"></span>[2](#fn_253).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:3:7">5:5:3:7</span></span>7. From
the throne-seat he slips into the shoes; and on shoes (he stands),
whatever his vehicle may be, whether a chariot or anything else. For
verily he who performs the Râ*g*asûya is high above everything here, and
everything here is beneath him;--therefore this is for him a religious
observance: as long

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

as he lives he does not stand on the earth (with bare feet).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_249"></span>[126:1](sbe4125.htm#fr_249.md) He is, however,
allowed to shave his heard. According to Lâ*t*y. Sr. IX, 2, 20 seq., he
is to pass his nights during the year in the fire-house on a tiger's
skin; he is never to enter the village, and is constantly to keep up the
fire. Nor is any one in his kingdom, except a Brâhman, to get his hair
cut, and even the horses are to remain unclipped.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[126:2](sbe4125.htm#fr_250.md) The Ke*s*avapanîya,
or 'hair-cutting' (sacrifice), the fourth of the seven Soma-sacrifices
enjoined for the inauguration of a king, is to be performed on the
full-moon of *G*yesh*th*a (about <span id="page_127">p. 127</span> May
1), a twelvemonth after the Abhishe*k*anîya, and is to take the form of
the Atirâtra-*G*yotish*t*oma. As usual, the author only alludes to any
special peculiarities from the ordinary performance. The ordinary
ascending scale of stomas--viz. the Triv*ri*t-stoma for the
Bahishpavamâna-stotra, the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a for the Â*g*ya-stotras and the
Mâdhyandina-pavamâna; the Saptada*s*a for the P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras, and
the T*ri*tîya-pavamâna; and the Ekavi*ms*a-stoma for the
Agnish*t*oma-sâman--prescribed for the twelve stotras of the
Agnish*t*oma (part i, p. 310 seq.), is to be reversed on the present
occasion, and the scale of stomas is to be a descending one. The
succeeding stotras--viz. (13-15) the three Uktha-stotras; (16) the
Sho*d*a*s*in; and (17-28) the three rounds of the night service
requiring four stotras each--are likewise to be performed in the
Pa*ñk*ada*s*a (or fifteen-versed) stoma, employed for the hymns of the
evening pressing.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[127:1](sbe4125.htm#fr_251.md) The Sandhi-stotra,
or Twilight hymn, Sâma-veda II, 99-104, is the final stotra of the
Atirâtra (part ii, p. 398). Each of the three couplets is, as usual,
sung as a triplet, the three thus producing the nine verses of the
Triv*ri*t-stoma. The Rathantara tune, to which the couplets are to be
sung, is given in the Uhyagâna (Sâma-veda, vol. v, p. 381), but with
different verses, viz. Sâma-veda I, 30, 31 (abhi tvâ *s*ûra nonumo), the
verses most commonly sung to that famous tune. The chanters' manuals of
the Atirâtra (e. g. Ind. Off. MS. 1748) accordingly adapt the tune to
the verses here required (enâ vo agni*m* namaso).

<span id="fn_252"></span>[128:1](sbe4125.htm#fr_252.md) The first (or
Hot*ri*'s) P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra at the midday-service is either the
Rathantara, Sâma-veda II, 30, 31 (as for instance at the Agnish*t*oma),
or B*ri*hat-sâman II, 159-160 (as at the Ukthya sacrifice). The B*ri*hat
is also ordinarily chanted at the Atirâtra, but on the present occasion
the Rathantara is to be substituted for it.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[128:2](sbe4125.htm#fr_253.md) Sâya*n*a interprets
this passage so as to imply two separate injunctions:--'For as long as
he lives this (cutting down of his hair) is a religious observance for
him; and he does not stand on the ground (without shoes).' The
repetition in the next paragraph, however, renders this interpretation
very improbable.
