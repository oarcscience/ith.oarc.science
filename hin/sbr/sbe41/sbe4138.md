### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:2:1">6:4:2:1</span></span>1. He
then touches the lump of clay, with (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 32), 'Thou art the
Purîshya <span id="fr_441"></span>[1](#fn_440),'--that is, 'Thou art
favourable to cattle; all-supporting,'--for he (Agni) indeed supports
everything here;--'Atharvan was the first that kindled thee, O
Agni!'--Atharvan doubtless is the breath, and the breath indeed churned
him out (produced him) at first: 'Thou art that Agni who was produced at
first,' this he means to say; and that same (Agni) he thus makes it (the
lump) to be.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:2:2">6:4:2:2</span></span>2. He
then takes hold of it with the (right) hand and spade on the right side;
and with the (left) hand on the left side, with, 'From the lotus
Atharvan churned thee forth,'--the lotus doubtless means the waters, and
Atharvan is the breath; and the breath indeed churned him (Agni, the
fire) out of the waters at first;--'from the head of every offerer <span
id="fr_442"></span>[2](#fn_441),'--that is, 'from the head of this All
(universe).'

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:2:3">6:4:2:3</span></span>3.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 33; *Ri*k S. VI, 16, 14\] 'Also the sage Dadhya*ñk*, the
son of Atharvan, kindled thee;'--Dadhya*ñk*, the Âtharvana, doubtless is
speech; and he did kindle him therefrom;--'as the V*ri*tra-slayer, the
breaker of strongholds,'--V*ri*tra is evil, thus: 'as the slayer of
evil, the breaker of strongholds.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:2:4">6:4:2:4</span></span>4.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 34; *Ri*k S. VI, 16, 15\] 'Also Pâthya, the bull,
kindled thee, as the greatest slayer of enemies,'--Pâthya, the bull,
doubtless is the Mind, and he did kindle him therefrom;--'as a winner of
wealth in every battle,'--as the text, so its meaning.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:2:5">6:4:2:5</span></span>5. With
Gâyatrî verses (he performs),--the Gâyatrî is the vital air: he thus
lays vital air into him. With three (verses);--there are three vital
airs, the out-breathing, the in-breathing, and the through-breathing:
these he thus lays into him. These (verses) consist of nine feet, for
there are nine vital airs, seven in the head, and two downward ones:
these he thus lays into him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:2:6">6:4:2:6</span></span>6. And
these two following ones are Trish*t*ubhs,--(Vâ*g*. S. XI, 35, 36; *Ri*k
S. III, 29, 8; II, 9, 1). Now, the Trish*t*ubh is the body (self): it is
his (Agni's) body he makes up by means of these two

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (verses). 'Seat
thee, O Hot*ri*, in thine own place, thou, the mindful,'--the Hot*ri*,
doubtless, is Agni; and this, the black antelope skin, is indeed his own
place; 'the mindful,' that is, 'the wise one;'--'establish the sacrifice
in the seat of the good work!'--the seat of the good work doubtless is
the black antelope skin;--'god-gladdening, thou shalt worship the gods
with offering!'--that is, 'being a god, gratifying the gods, thou shalt
worship (them) with offering;'--'Bestow, O Agni, great vigour upon the
Sacrificer!'--thereby he implores a blessing upon the Sacrificer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:2:7">6:4:2:7</span></span>7. 'The
Hot*ri*, in the Hot*ri*'s seat, the knowing,'--the Hot*ri*, doubtless,
is Agni; the Hot*ri*'s seat is the black antelope skin; and the
knowing <span id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_442) means the wise one;--'the
impetuous and glowing one, of great power, hath sat down,'--that is, the
impetuous and shining one, of great power, has sat down;--'the guardian
of undisturbed rites, the most wealthy,'--for he indeed is the guardian
of undisturbed rites, and the most wealthy;--'the bearer of thousands,
the brilliant-tongued Agni,'--a thousand means all, thus, 'the
all-bearer, the brilliant-tongued Agni.' With two Trish*t*ubh (verses)
relating to Agni (he performs): the meaning of this has been told.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:2:8">6:4:2:8</span></span>8. Then
there is this last B*ri*hatî verse, for this (fire-altar) when
completely built up becomes like the B*ri*hatî (the great) metre:
whatlike seed is infused into the womb, suchlike is (the child) born;
and because he now makes this verse a B*ri*hatî,

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

therefore this (altar) when completely built up becomes like the
B*ri*hatî.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:2:9">6:4:2:9</span></span>9.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 37; *Ri*k S. I, 36, 9\] 'Seat thee, thou art great,'--he
now causes the infused seed to establish itself, whence the seed infused
into the womb establishes itself;--'burn thou, best gladdener of the
gods!'--that is, 'shine thou, best gladdener of the gods; send forth, O
Agni, worthy partaker of the offering, thy showy, ruddy smoke!' for when
he (Agni) is kindled, he sends forth his ruddy smoke,--the showy, for
it, as it were, shows itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:2:10">6:4:2:10</span></span>10.
These (verses) amount to six,--six seasons are a year, and Agni is the
year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does
this become. And what comes to be like the year, comes to be like the
B*ri*hatî; for the year is the B*ri*hatî,--twelve full moons, twelve
eighth days <span id="fr_444"></span>[1](sbe4139.htm#fn_443) (of the
fortnight of waning moon), twelve new moons, that makes thirty-six, and
the B*ri*hatî consists of thirty-six syllables. He takes it (the lump of
clay) from the right (south) to the left (north) side (of the hole), for
from the right side seed is infused into the womb; and this (hole) now
is his (Agni's) womb. He takes it thither without stopping, so as not to
stop the seed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_440"></span>[217:1](sbe4138.htm#fr_441) See [p.
201](sbe4134.htm#page_201), note [1](sbe4134.htm#fn_415).

<span id="fn_441"></span>[217:2](sbe4138.htm#fr_442) ? Or, of every
priest (vi*s*vasya vâghata*h*). There is nothing to <span
id="page_218">p. 218</span> show how the author of this part of the
Brâhma*n*a interprets 'vâghat.' Cf. [VI, 4, 3,
10](sbe4139.htm#6:4:3:10).--Professor Ludwig (*Ri*k S. VI, 16, 13)
translates, 'from the head of the priest Vi*s*va.' Mahîdhara offers
several interpretations, according to which 'vâghata*h*' may either be
taken as nom. plur., the verb being again supplied in the plural,--'the
priests churned thee out from the head of the universe,' or 'the priests
of the universe (or all priests) churned thee out,'--or 'vâghata*h*' may
be ablative sing., like 'mûrdhna*h*,' qualifying 'pushkarât,'--from the
lotus, the head, the leader (or, starter, vâhakât) of the universe.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[219:1](sbe4138.htm#fr_443) Thus the author
evidently interprets 'vídâna*h*,' instead of being found,' 'se
trouvant,' as is its real meaning.
