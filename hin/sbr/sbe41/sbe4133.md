### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:3:1">6:2:3:1</span></span>1. Now,
the gods said, 'Meditate ye!'--whereby, no doubt, they meant to say,
'Seek ye a layer <span id="fr_381"></span>[5](#fn_381.md) (for the
fire-altar)! 'Whilst they were meditating,

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pra*g*âpati saw
this earth, as a first naturally-perforated <span
id="fr_382"></span>[1](#fn_382.md) layer: hence it is by means of
Pra*g*âpati that he lays on that (brick) <span
id="fr_383"></span>[2](#fn_383.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:3:2">6:2:3:2</span></span>2. Agni
said to him (Pra*g*âpati), 'I will step nigh!'--'Wherewith?'--'With
cattle!'--'So be it!' He thereby doubtless meant to say, 'with the
cattle-brick;' for that cattle-brick is the same as the
dûrvâ-brick <span id="fr_384"></span>[3](#fn_384.md): hence the dûrvâ-brick
is laid so as not to be separated from the first naturally-perforated
one; hence also not separated from this earth are the plants, the
cattle, the fire,--for not separated (from the earth) <span
id="fr_385"></span>[4](#fn_385) he (Agni.md) stepped nigh with this
(brick).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:3:3">6:2:3:3</span></span>3. They
said, 'Meditate ye yet!' whereby no doubt they meant to say, 'Seek ye a
layer! seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!' Whilst they were

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

meditating, Indra and Agni, and Vi*s*vakarman saw the air, as a second
naturally-perforated layer: hence he lays on that (brick <span
id="fr_386"></span>[1](#fn_386).md) by means of Indra and Agni, and
Vi*s*vakarman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:3:4">6:2:3:4</span></span>4. Vâyu
said to them, 'I will step nigh!' Wherewith!'--'With the regions!'--'So
be it!' He thereby doubtless meant to say, 'with the regional
(bricks <span id="fr_387"></span>[2](#fn_387).md):' hence on the second
naturally-perforated one the regional ones are laid, without being
separated from it <span id="fr_388"></span>[3](#fn_388.md); and hence not
separated from the air are the regions, the wind; for not separated
therefrom he (Vâyu) stepped nigh with this (brick).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:3:5">6:2:3:5</span></span>5. They
said, 'Meditate ye yet!'--whereby no doubt they said, 'Seek ye a layer!
seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!' Whilst they were meditating,
Paramesh*th*in saw the sky, as a third naturally-perforated layer:
whence it is by Paramesh*th*in (the most high) he lays on that
(brick <span id="fr_389"></span>[4](#fn_389).md).

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:3:6">6:2:3:6</span></span>6. Yonder
Sun said to him, 'I will step nigh!'--'Wherewith?'--'With a
space-filling (brick <span id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_390).md).'--'So be
it!'--Now he (the sun) indeed is the space-filler: 'by (mine own) self,'
he thus means to say. Hence the third naturally-perforated one is laid
on so as not to be separated from the space-filling one <span
id="fr_391"></span>[2](#fn_391.md); and hence yonder sun is not separated
from the sky, for not separated therefrom did he step nigh with this
(brick).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:3:7">6:2:3:7</span></span>7. These
six deities forsooth became all this (universe), whatsoever exists here.
The gods and the Rishis said, 'Those six deities forsooth have become
all this (universe): bethink ye yourselves how we also may share
therein!' They said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby doubtless they meant to say,
'Seek ye a layer! seek ye how we also may share in this <span
id="fr_392"></span>[3](#fn_392.md)! Whilst they were meditating, the gods
saw a second, the *Ri*shis a fourth, layer <span
id="fr_393"></span>[4](#fn_393.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:3:8">6:2:3:8</span></span>8. They
said, 'We will step nigh!'--'Wherewith?'--'With what is over and above
these worlds!'--'So be it!' Now what there is above the earth on this
side of the air, therewith the gods stepped nigh, that is this second
layer; and what there

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

is above the air on this side of the sky, therewith the Rishis stepped
nigh, that is this fourth layer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:3:9">6:2:3:9</span></span>9. Now
when they said, 'Meditate ye (*k*etayadhvam)!' they doubtless meant to
say, 'Seek ye a layer (*k*itim i*kkh*ata)!' and inasmuch as meditating
(*k*etay) they saw them, therefore they are 'layers' (*k*itaya*h*).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:3:10">6:2:3:10</span></span>10.
Pra*g*âpati saw the first layer: Pra*g*âpati assuredly is its
(spiritual) ancestry. The gods saw the second layer: the gods assuredly
are its ancestry. Indra and Agni, and Vi*s*vakarman saw the third layer:
they assuredly are its ancestry. The *Ri*shis saw the fourth layer: the
Rishis assuredly are its ancestry. Paramesh*th*in saw the fifth layer:
Paramesh*th*in assuredly is its ancestry. And, verily, whosoever so
knows that (spiritual) ancestry of the structures (layers of the
fire-altar), his structures are indeed possessed of an ancestry,
possessed of relations (or, of mystic significance, bandhu).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_381"></span>[186:5](sbe4133.htm#fr_381.md) The author here
connects the causal verb '*k*etay' (to reflect) with '*k*i,' to pile, to
build; or rather with '*k*itim ish,' to desire building (an altar).

<span id="fn_382"></span>[187:1](sbe4133.htm#fr_382.md) See [p.
155](sbe4129.htm#page_155), note [8](sbe4129.htm#fn_316.md).

<span id="fn_383"></span>[187:2](sbe4133.htm#fr_383) Or, that (layer.md),
the three naturally-perforated bricks occupying the centre of the first,
third, and fifth layers of the altar, these bricks are, as it were, the
representatives of the respective layers. This first svayam-ât*rinn*â
brick is laid down with the formula, 'May Pra*g*âpati settle thee!' See
[VII, 4, 2, 6](sbe4164.htm#7:4:2:6.md).

<span id="fn_384"></span>[187:3](sbe4133.htm#fr_384.md) A stalk of Dûrvâ
(Dûb) grass--Panicum (or Cynodon) dactylon, or Agrostis linearis--is
laid upon the first naturally-perforated brick (which again lies on the
man of gold) in such a way that the root lies upon it and the tops
hanging down to the ground. 'Its flowers in the perfect state are among
the loveliest objects in the vegetable world, and appear through a lens
like minute rubies and emeralds in constant motion from the least breath
of air. It is the sweetest and most nutritious pasture for cattle, and
its usefulness, added to its beauty, induced the Hindus in the earliest
ages to believe it was the mansion of a benevolent nymph.' Sir W. Jones,
Works, vol. v, p. 78. Professor R. Wallace, in his 'India in 1887,'
gives an excellent illustration of this famous grass. He remarks (p.
282) that it has a wonderful power of remaining green, being the grass
of all Indian grasses which retains its succulence throughout the
extreme heat of summer.'

<span id="fn_385"></span>[187:4](sbe4133.htm#fr_385.md) That is to say,
immediately after (the earth-brick had been laid on).

<span id="fn_386"></span>[188:1](sbe4133.htm#fr_386.md) This second
naturally-perforated brick, representing the air, forms the centre of
the third layer of the altar. See VIII, 3, 1, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_387"></span>[188:2](sbe4133.htm#fr_387.md) That is, the bricks
marking the regions, or quarters (di*s*yâ); five of these are laid down
immediately after the self-perforated one, in the four directions from
it, two of them being laid on the south. See VIII, 3, 1, 11.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[188:3](sbe4133.htm#fr_388.md) Viz. without being
separated from the layer which the second svayam-ât*rinn*â represents.
They would seem to lie about a foot away from the central brick; but as
no other special brick lies between them, they may on that account be
considered as not separated from it.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[188:4](sbe4133.htm#fr_389.md) The third
svayam-ât*rinn*â, though considered as forming part of the fifth layer,
is really laid on the top of it or rather on the 'puna*sk*iti'--an
additional pile of eight bricks laid over the central, gârhapatya-like,
portion of the fifth layer (cf. [VI, 6, 1, 14](sbe4145.htm#6:6:1:14.md),
with note \*[3](sbe4145.htm#fn_486)\*.md). It is laid down with the formula
'May the Most High settle thee!'--and on it the fire is subsequently
placed. See VIII, 7, 3, 13 seq.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[189:1](sbe4133.htm#fr_390.md) See [p.
153](sbe4129.htm#page_153), note \*[1](sbe4129.htm#fn_306.md)\*.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[189:2](sbe4133.htm#fr_391.md) The laying down of
the last svayam-ât*rinn*â (together with the likewise perforated
'vikar*n*î') is immediately preceded by the filling up of the fifth
layer with the 'space-filling' bricks, only one of which has the common
formula pronounced over it. See VIII, 7, 2, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[189:3](sbe4133.htm#fr_392.md) Viz. in this
universe, and, as a representation thereof, in this fire-altar.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[189:4](sbe4133.htm#fr_393.md) In the foregoing
1-5 paragraphs only those three layers, which have a
'naturally-perforated' brick in the centre, viz. the first, third, and
fifth layers, were mentioned. The author now remarks on the two other
layers, representing as it were the space between the three worlds.
