### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:3:1">6:4:3:1</span></span>1. He
then pours water into it (the hole), for whatever is injured or torn in
this earth that is healed by water: by means of the water he thus joins
together and heals what is injured and torn in her.

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:3:2">6:4:3:2</span></span>2.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 38\] 'Let flow the divine waters, the honey-sweet, for
health, for progeny!'--honey means sap (essence): thus, 'the sapful, for
health, for progeny;'--'from their seed let plants spring forth,
full-berried!' for full-berried plants indeed spring forth from the seat
of the waters.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:3:3">6:4:3:3</span></span>3. He
then heals her with air <span id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_444.md); for
whatever is injured and torn in this earth that is healed by the air: by
means of air he thus joins together and heals what is injured and torn
in her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:3:4">6:4:3:4</span></span>4.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 39\] 'May Vâyu Mâtari*s*van heal,'--Vâyu Mâtari*s*van,
doubtless, is he (the wind) that blows yonder;--'the broken heart of
thee stretched out with upward look!' for this (hole) is the broken
heart of this earth stretched out with upward look;--'thou who goest
along by the breath of the gods,'--for he (the wind) indeed goes along
by means of the breath of all the gods;--'to thee, Ka, be vasha*t*
(success), O god!'--Ka ('Who?') doubtless is Pra*g*âpati, for him he
makes this earth to be the Vasha*t*, for there is so far no other
oblation than that.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:3:5">6:4:3:5</span></span>5. He
then heals her by means of the quarters, for whatever is injured and
torn in this earth, that is healed by the quarters: by means of the
quarters he thus draws and joins together what is injured and torn in
her. He joins together this and this quarter <span
id="fr_446"></span>[2](#fn_445.md), whence these two quarters are joined

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

together; then this one and this one, whence these two also are joined
together: first thus, then thus; then thus, then thus. This is moving
(from left) to right, for so (it goes) to the gods: with this and this
one a means of healing is prepared; with this and this one he heals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:3:6">6:4:3:6</span></span>6. He
then takes up together the black antelope skin and the lotus-leaf; for
the lotus-leaf is the womb, and with the womb he takes up that infused
seed: whence the infused seed is taken up by the womb. \[He does so,
with, Vâ*g*. S. XI, 40\] 'Wellborn with splendour, the refuge and
shelter, hath he settled down in the light;' for well-born he is, and he
settles down in the refuge, and shelter, and light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:3:7">6:4:3:7</span></span>7. He
then ties it (the lump) up: he thereby keeps the seed within the womb;
whence the seed kept within the womb does not escape. With a string (he
ties it), for with the string they yoke the draught beast;--with a
triple one of reed grass: the significance of this has been told <span
id="fr_447"></span>[1](#fn_446.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:3:8">6:4:3:8</span></span>8. He
lays it round (the skin), with, 'Invest thyself, O lustrous Agni, in the
many-coloured garment!' In the sacrifice the cord is Varu*n*ic; having
thereby made it non-Varu*n*ic, he makes him put on (the skin) as one
would make a garment be put on.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:3:9">6:4:3:9</span></span>9. He
then takes it and rises;--that Agni being yonder sun, he thus causes
yonder sun to rise;--with (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 41) <span
id="fr_448"></span>[2](#fn_447.md), 'Rise, thou of good rites,'--the
sacrifice doubtless is a rite: thus, 'rise thou, well

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

worthy of sacrifice;'--'Guard us with godly wisdom!'--that is, 'whatever
divine wisdom is thine, therewith guard us!'--'Most brilliant to see
with great light,'--that is, 'in order to be seen most brilliant with
great light;'--'hither, O Agni, come thou with praises!'--the
praises <span id="fr_449"></span>[1](#fn_448.md) are the steeds: thus,
'hither, O Agni, come with the steeds.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:3:10">6:4:3:10</span></span>10. He
then lifts it upwards from there towards the east; for this Agni is
yonder sun: he thus places yonder sun upwards from here in the east, and
hence yonder sun is placed upwards from here in the east. \[He does so,
with, Vâ*g*. S. XI, 42; *Ri*k S. I, 36, 13\] 'Upright for our
protection, stand thou like the god Savit*ri*!'--as the text, so its
meaning;--'upright, as a bestower <span id="fr_450"></span>[2](#fn_449.md)
of strength,'--for standing upright he (the sun) indeed bestows <span
id="fr_451"></span>[2](#fn_449.md) strength, food;--'when we utter our call
with the shining offerers'--the shining offerers <span
id="fr_452"></span>[3](#fn_450), doubtless, are his (the sun's.md) rays: it
is these he means. He lifts it up beyond the reach of his arms, for
beyond the reach of his arms is that (sun) from here. He then lowers it;
and having lowered it, he holds it above the navel: the meaning of this
(will be explained) hereafter <span id="fr_453"></span>[4](#fn_451.md).

<span id="fn_444"></span>[221:1](sbe4139.htm#fr_445.md) Viz. by fanning air
into the hole with the hand.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[221:2](sbe4139.htm#fr_446.md) With his 'nameless'
(or little) finger, he pushes some of the loose soil into the hole,
first from the front (east) and back (west) . sides, and then from the
right (south) and left (north) sides. Thus, according to Kâty. XVI, 3,
4, the sunwise movement is <span id="page_222">p. 222</span> obtained by
the hand moving from east (along the south) to west, and then from south
(along the west) to north.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[222:1](sbe4139.htm#fr_447.md) See [VI, 3 1,
27](sbe4134.htm#6:3:1:27.md).

<span id="fn_447"></span>[222:2](sbe4139.htm#fr_448.md) See *Ri*k S. VIII,
23, 5, differing considerably.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[223:1](sbe4139.htm#fr_449.md) The author might
seem to connect '*s*asti' (in su*s*asti) with '*s*âs,' to rule, control,
instead of with '*s*ams,' to praise; Sâya*n*a, however, takes
'su*s*asti' as a bahuvrîhi, 'with the praiseworthy,' i.e. with the
steeds deserving praise, because they draw well (*s*obhanâ *s*astir
eshâm . . . sâdhu vahanty a*s*vâ*h*). It is indeed not improbable that
this was the author's intention.
