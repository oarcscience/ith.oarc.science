### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:2:1">5:5:2:1</span></span>1. He
performs the oblations of teams (prayu*g*â*m* havî*m*shi). The reason
why he performs the oblations of teams, is that the anointed thereby
yokes the seasons, and thus yoked those seasons draw him along, and he
follows the seasons thus yoked: therefore he performs the oblations of
teams.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:2:2">5:5:2:2</span></span>2. There
are twelve of these (oblations), for there are twelve months in the
year: that is why there are twelve. 'Let him make offering month by
month,' they say. Who knows about (the life of) man <span
id="fr_242"></span>[2](#fn_242)? Let him therefore not make offering
month by month. Moving eastward he offers six of them each at the
distance of the yoke-pin's throw from the other <span
id="fr_243"></span>[3](#fn_243); and then turning backward he offers
six, each at a yoke-pin's throw from the other.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:2:3">5:5:2:3</span></span>3. But
let him not do it thus. He prepares those first six so as to have a
common barhis <span id="fr_244"></span>[1](#fn_244), after the manner of
those deities (of the first six oblations); even as in early spring
they <span id="fr_245"></span>[2](#fn_245) would yoke their team and go
onward until the rainy season, so does he now yoke the six seasons, and
thus yoked the six seasons draw him forward and he follows the six
seasons thus yoked until the rainy season. Two of the (oxen) drawing the
original (hall-door) fire are the sacrificial fee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:2:4">5:5:2:4</span></span>4. He
prepares the last six oblations so as to have a common barhis, after the
manner of those (six) deities. Even as they would return again towards
the rainy season, so does he yoke the six seasons, and thus yoked the
six seasons draw him towards the rainy season, and he follows the six
seasons thus yoked, in the rainy season. Two of the (oxen) drawing the
original fire are the sacrificial fee. And as to why the (oxen) drawing
the original fire are the sacrificial fee,--the consecrated (king) now
yokes the seasons, and it being oxen that (actually) draw (and thus
represent the seasons), therefore the (oxen) drawing the original fire
are the sacrificial fee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:2:5">5:5:2:5</span></span>5. Now as
to this the Kurupa*ñk*âlas used formerly to say, 'It is the seasons
that, being yoked, draw us, and we follow the seasons thus yoked.' It
was because their kings were performers of the Râ*g*asûya that they
spake thus.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:2:6">5:5:2:6</span></span>6. There
is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni, a pap for Soma, a cake on twelve
or eight potsherds for Savit*ri*, a pap for B*ri*haspati, a cake on ten
potsherds for Tvash*tri*, and one on twelve potsherds for (Agni)
Vai*s*vânara--these are the first six oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:2:7">5:5:2:7</span></span>7. The
six last are paps,--a pap for Sarasvatî, a pap for Pûshan, a pap for
Mitra, a pap for Kshetrapati (the Landlord or Lord of the manor), a pap
for Varu*n*a, and a pap for Aditi,--these are the last six paps.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:2:8">5:5:2:8</span></span>8.
Thereupon they seize <span id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_246) a
reddish-white (cow) which is clearly with calf, (as a victim) for Aditi.
The mode of procedure regarding her is the same as that of the
eight-footed barren cow <span id="fr_247"></span>[2](#fn_247). Now,
Aditi being this earth, it is her embryo (child) he thereby causes him
(the king) to be. The sacrificial fee for this (cow-offering) is just
such a reddish-white cow that is clearly with calf.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:2:9">5:5:2:9</span></span>9. They
then seize a dappled one, which is clearly with calf, (as a victim) for
the Maruts. The mode of procedure regarding this one is the same. The
Maruts being the clans, he thereby makes him the embryo <span
id="fr_248"></span>[3](#fn_248) of the clans. The sacrificial fee for
this (cow-offering) is just such a dappled (cow) that is clearly with
calf.

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:2:10">5:5:2:10</span></span>10.
These two animal victims, whilst being such, are seized (by some) in a
different way. The one that is seized for Aditi, (some) seize for the
Âdityas,--the Âdityas being the All, he (the priest) thereby makes him
the embryo of the All (universe). And the one that is seized for the
Maruts, (some) seize for the All-gods,--the All-gods being the All, he
thereby makes him the embryo of the All.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_242"></span>[123:2](sbe4124.htm#fr_242) 'But who (knows if
he) will live a year?' Taitt. Br. I, 8, 4. 3.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[123:3](sbe4124.htm#fr_243) In that case, he
could offer them as distinct ish*t*is, each with its special barhis, and
moving eastwards from the Âhavanîya fire.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[124:1](sbe4124.htm#fr_244) That is to say, the
first six oblations are to be combined and performed together as a
single offering, without changing the covering of sacrificial grass on
the altar.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[124:2](sbe4124.htm#fr_245) Sâya*n*a supplies
'kings,' and refers to Taitt. Br. I, 8, 4, 1, where the Kurupa*ñk*âla
(kings) are said to issue forth in the dewy season (on a raid over the
eastern country), and to return with their booty at the end of the hot
season. See [paragraph 5](sbe4124.htm#5:5:2:5).

<span id="fn_246"></span>[125:1](sbe4124.htm#fr_246) In the Taittirîya
ceremonial this animal sacrifice precedes the 'prayu*g*â*m* havî*m*shi;'
being itself succeeded in the first place by the 'sâtyadûtânâ*m*
havî*m*shi.'

<span id="fn_247"></span>[125:2](sbe4124.htm#fr_247) On the course of
procedure regarding the 'ash*t*âpadî,' or (supposed) barren cow, found
ultimately to be impregnated, see part ii, p. 391 seq.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[125:3](sbe4124.htm#fr_248) That is, he causes
him to spring forth from the midst of the people, and be protected by
them on all sides.
