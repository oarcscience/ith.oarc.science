#### THE BUILDING OF THE ALTAR.

#### THE FIRST LAYER.

### FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:1">7:4:1:1</span></span>1. Being
about to build Agni (the fire-altar), he takes him up into his own self;
for from out of his own self he causes him to be born, and wherefrom one
is born, suchlike he becomes. Now were he to build up Agni without
taking him up into his own self, he would beget man from man, mortal
from mortal, one not freed from sin from one not freed from sin; but
when he builds up Agni after taking him up into his own self, he causes
Agni to be born from Agni, the immortal from the immortal, the sinless
from the sinless.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:2">7:4:1:2</span></span>2. He
takes him in (by muttering, Vâ*g*. S. X III, 1), 'Within me I first take
Agni,' he thereby first takes Agni into his own self;--'for increase of
wealth, for healthy progeny, for vigorous manhood!' and hereby he takes
all blessings to himself;--'and may the deities stand by me!' and hereby
he takes all the gods to himself; and thus he takes into his own self
all that he is about to generate from his own self. Having taken Agni

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

into his own self whilst standing, he builds him up sitting;--Agni is an
animal: hence the animal, having received the foetus standing, gives
birth after lying down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:3">7:4:1:3</span></span>3. He now
sings the Satya Sâman <span id="fr_680"></span>[1](#fn_678) (true hymn.md).
For the gods then said, 'Let us make the truth (satya) his mouth (or
beginning): thus we shall become the truth, truth will turn unto us, and
true will become that wish of ours for which we are about to perform
this rite!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:4">7:4:1:4</span></span>4. They
sang that 'true hymn' at the outset, and thus made the truth his
(Agni's) mouth; and they became the truth; the truth turned unto them,
and true became that wish of theirs for which they performed this rite.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:5">7:4:1:5</span></span>5. And in
like manner when the Sacrificer now, at the outset, sings the 'true
hymn,' he thereby makes the truth his (Agni's) mouth; and he (himself)
becomes the truth; and truth turns unto him; and true becomes that wish
of his for which he performs this rite.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:6">7:4:1:6</span></span>6. Now
that truth is the same as the waters, for the waters are the truth.
Hence they say, 'Whereby <span id="fr_681"></span>[2](#fn_679.md) the
waters flow, that is a form of the truth.' It is the waters indeed that
were made first of this universe: hence when the waters (rains) flow,
then everything whatsoever exists is produced here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:7">7:4:1:7</span></span>7. He
then puts down a lotus-leaf (in the centre of

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

the altar-site);--the lotus-leaf is a womb: he hereby puts a womb to it
(for Agni to be born from).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:8">7:4:1:8</span></span>8. And,
again, why he puts down a lotus-leaf;--the lotus means the waters, and
this earth is a leaf thereof: even as the lotus-leaf here lies spread on
the water, so this earth lies spread on the waters. Now this same earth
is Agni's womb, for Agni (the fire-altar) is this earth, since thereof
the whole Agni is built up: it is this earth he thus lays down. He lays
it down so as not to be separated from the truth: he thereby establishes
this earth on the truth;--hence this earth is established on the truth;
and hence the truth is this earth, for this earth is the most certain of
these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:9">7:4:1:9</span></span>9. \[He
lays it down, with Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 2\] 'The waters’ back thou art, the
womb of Agni,' for this earth is indeed the back of the waters, and the
womb of Agni;--'around the swelling ocean,' for the ocean indeed swells
around this earth;--'growing great on the lotus,' that is, 'growing,
flourish thou on the lotus;'--'spread out with the extent, with the
breadth, of the sky!' with this he strokes along (the leaf),--for this
Agni is yonder sun, and no other extent but that of the sky is able to
contain him: he thus says (to the leaf), Having become the sky, contain
him! He lays it down with a Svarâ*g* verse, for self-rule (svârâ*g*ya)
belongs to the waters. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the
Sûdadohas <span id="fr_682"></span>[1](#fn_680.md) upon it: the
significance of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:10">7:4:1:10</span></span>10. He
then puts the gold plate <span id="fr_683"></span>[2](#fn_681.md) thereon.
Now

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

this gold plate is yonder sun, for he shines over all the creatures here
on earth; and 'ro*k*as' (shine) they mystically call 'rukma' (gold
plate), for the gods love the mystic: he thus lays down yonder sun (on
the altar). It is golden, and round, with one and twenty knobs,--the
significance of this has been explained. He puts it down with the knobs
pointing downward; for the knobs are his (the sun's) rays, and his rays
(shine) downwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:11">7:4:1:11</span></span>11. He
puts it down on the lotus-leaf;--the lotus-leaf is a womb: in the womb
he thus places him (Agni).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:12">7:4:1:12</span></span>12.
And, again, why he puts it on the lotus-leaf;--the lotus-leaf is a
foundation, for the lotus-leaf is this earth, and this earth is the
foundation: he who is not settled on this earth, is unsettled even as
one who is far away. Now by means of his rays that (sun) is settled on
this earth: he thus settles him (Agni) on this earth, as his foundation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:13">7:4:1:13</span></span>13.
And, again, why he puts it on the lotus-leaf. When Indra had smitten
V*ri*tra, he, thinking that he had not laid him low, entered the waters.
He said to them, 'I am afraid: make ye a stronghold for me!' Now what
essence of the waters there was that they gathered upwards (on the
surface), and made it a stronghold for him; and because they made (kar)
a stronghold (pû*h*) for him, therefore it is 'pûshkara;' 'pûshkara'
being what is mystically called 'push-kara' (lotus-leaf), for the gods
love the mystic. Now when he puts it (the gold plate) on the lotus-leaf,
he then establishes him (Agni) in that essence which the waters gathered
together for him (Indra), and in that stronghold which they made for
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:14">7:4:1:14</span></span>14.
\[He puts it down, with Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 3\]

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'The Brahman first
born in front;' the Brahman doubtless is yonder sun, and he is born day
by day in front (in the east);--'from the summit <span
id="fr_684"></span>[1](#fn_682.md) he, the longing, overspread the
shining,' the summit doubtless is the middle, the shining ones are these
worlds, and the longing one is yonder sun,--he is the longing one
inasmuch as he longed to be born; and in rising he overspreads <span
id="fr_685"></span>[2](#fn_683) these (worlds.md) from the summit, from the
middle;--'he (overspread) the nighest extents of the deep,' his nighest
extents of the deep doubtless are the regions, for he (the sun) does
extend nigh to them;--'the womb of the existent and of the non-existent
did he overspread!' the womb of the existent and of the non-existent
doubtless are these worlds; for both what exists and what does not exist
is born from these worlds. He puts it on with a trish*t*ubh verse, for
yonder (sun) is related to the Trish*t*ubh <span
id="fr_686"></span>[3](#fn_684.md). Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the
Sûdadohas <span id="fr_687"></span>[4](#fn_685.md) verse upon it: the
significance of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:15">7:4:1:15</span></span>15. He
then lays the (gold) man thereon,--he is Pra*g*âpati, he is Agni, he is
the Sacrificer. He is made of gold, for gold is light, and fire is
light; gold is immortality, and fire is immortality. It is a man
(purusha), for Pra*g*âpati is the Man.

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:16">7:4:1:16</span></span>16.
And, again, why he lays down the man. When Pra*g*âpati was relaxed, his
pleasing form went out from within; when it had gone out of him, the
gods left him. When the gods restored him, they put that pleasing form
into him, and the gods were pleased with that (form) of his; and
inasmuch as the gods were pleased (ram) with that pleasing (ramya) form
of his, it is called 'hiramya;' 'hiramya' being what is mystically
called 'hira*n*ya' (gold), for the gods love the mystic. And in like
manner does this (Sacrificer) now put that pleasing form into him
(Agni), and the gods are pleased with that (form) of his. But that
pleasing form of his is the vital air: it is that vital air he thus puts
into him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:17">7:4:1:17</span></span>17. He
lays him on the gold plate, for the gold plate is yonder sun: that same
man who is in that (sun's) disk, it is him he now lays down (on the
altar).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:18">7:4:1:18</span></span>18. He
lays him down on his back <span id="fr_688"></span>[1](#fn_686.md);--for
the gods at that time said, 'If we lay down these two <span
id="fr_689"></span>[2](#fn_687.md) both looking hitherwards, they will burn
up everything here; and if (we lay) both so as to be turned away from
here, they will give warmth only in the opposite direction; and if
facing each other, then there will be light only between those two, and
they will injure each other.' They laid down the one so as to look
hitherwards, and the other so as to look away from here: that one (the
sun), the gold disk, looking downwards, gives warmth by his rays, and

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

that man (tends) upward by his vital airs <span
id="fr_690"></span>[1](#fn_688). He lays him down (with the head.md)
towards the east, for (with the head) towards the east this Agni (the
fire-altar) is built up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:19">7:4:1:19</span></span>19.
\[He lays him down, with Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 4; *Ri*k S. X, 121, 1\]
'Hira*n*yagarbha came first into existence,' for that golden child did
come first into existence;--'born he was the one lord of being;' for he
indeed was born as the one lord of all this being;--'he upholdeth this
earth and the sky,' for he (the sun) does uphold both the sky and the
earth;--'to the god Ka let us do homage by offering!' Ka (Who?) is
Pra*g*âpati: thus, 'let us do homage to Him by offering!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:20">7:4:1:20</span></span>20.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 5; *Ri*k S. X, 17, 11\] 'The drop leaped along the
earth and sky;' the drop is yonder sun, and he leaps both to the sky and
to the earth--thus (in rising) to that (sky), and thus (in setting) to
this (earth);--'along this seat, and that which was afore;' that is, to
this world, and to that one; or this (Âhavanîya altar) which is now
being built, and that (Gârhapatya altar) which yonder was built
before;--'(the drop) moving along the common seat;' for he (the sun)
moves along that common seat;--'the drop I offer along the seven
hotrâs;' the drop is yonder sun; and the seven hotrâs are the regions:
he thus establishes yonder sun in the regions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:21">7:4:1:21</span></span>21.
With two (verses) he lays him down;--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and
the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,
with so much he thus lays him down;--with two trish*t*ubh

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

verses, for he (the sun) is related to the Trish*t*ubh. Having 'settled'
him, he pronounces the Sûdadohas on him: the significance of this has
been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:22">7:4:1:22</span></span>22. He
then sings a Sâman. For the gods, having laid down that man, then saw
him (looking) even suchlike as yonder dry plank.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:23">7:4:1:23</span></span>23.
They said, 'Think ye upon this, how we may put vigour into this man!'
They said, 'Meditate ye (*k*etay)!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to
say, 'Seek ye to build up (*k*itim ish)! seek ye how we shall put vigour
into this man!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:24">7:4:1:24</span></span>24.
Whilst meditating, they saw this Sâman, and sang it, and thereby put
vigour into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby put
it into him: he sings on the man, he puts vigour into the man;--he sings
on the bright one <span id="fr_691"></span>[1](#fn_689.md), for Agni is all
bright things. After he has laid him down, let him not walk round him in
front, lest that Agni should injure him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:25">7:4:1:25</span></span>25. He
(the Sacrificer) then stands by (the gold man) worshipping him with the
Sarpanâma (serpent-named) formulas. The serpents doubtless are these
worlds, for these glide along (sarp) with everything here whatsoever
there is; and Agni is no other than the self (body) of all the gods.
They, the gods, having laid down (on the altar) that self of theirs,
were afraid lest these worlds should glide away with that self of
theirs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:26">7:4:1:26</span></span>26.
They saw those Sarpanâma and worshipped with them; by these (verses)
they stopped these worlds for him, and caused them to bend themselves;
and because they caused them to bend (nam) themselves,

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

therefore (the formulas are called) Sarpanâma. And in like manner does
the Sacrificer, when he stands by worshipping with the Sarpanâma
formulas, stop these worlds for him, and cause these worlds to bend
themselves; and so they do not glide away with that self of his.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:27">7:4:1:27</span></span>27.
And, again, why he stands by worshipping with the Sarpanâma
formulas;--the serpents are these worlds, for whatever creeps (sarp),
creeps in these worlds. Now when he worships with the Sarpanâma
formulas--whatever fiend there is in these worlds, whatever devourer,
whatever ogress,--all that he thereby appeases.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:28">7:4:1:28</span></span>28.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 6-8\] 'Homage be to the serpents, whichever are on
earth, and they that are in the air, and they that are in the sky, to
those serpents be homage!' whatever serpents there are in these three
worlds to them he thereby does homage.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:29">7:4:1:29</span></span>29.
'They that are the darts of demons,' for some (of the serpents), sent by
demons, bite;--'and those on the trees, and those which lie in holes, to
those serpents be homage!' he thereby does homage to the serpents that
lie both in trees, and in holes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:30">7:4:1:30</span></span>30. 'Or
those that are in the luminous sphere of the sky; or those in the rays
of the sun; those by which abode is made in the waters, to those
serpents be homage!' he hereby does homage to them wheresoever they are.
He does so by 'homage, homage,' for homage is sacrifice (worship): by
sacrifice, by homage, he thus worships them. Let him therefore not say
'homage be to thee,' to one not worthy of sacrifice, for it

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

would be just as if he said 'sacrifice (or, worship) be to thee!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:31">7:4:1:31</span></span>31.
With three (formulas) he worships,--three are these worlds, and
threefold, also, is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his
measure, by so much he thus stops these worlds (from moving); and by so
much does he appease everything here. Standing he worships, for these
worlds stand, as it were; and besides, while standing one is stronger.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:32">7:4:1:32</span></span>32.
Thereupon, having sat down he offers on (the gold man) with
fivefold-taken ghee,--the significance of this has been explained. On
each side (of the fire he offers), moving round: he thus gratifies him
(Agni) with food from all quarters.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:33">7:4:1:33</span></span>33.
And, again, why he offers thereon. The gods, having laid down that body
of theirs, now were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should smite
that (body) of theirs. They saw those Rakshas-killing
counter-charms <span id="fr_692"></span>[1](#fn_690.md),--(Vâ*g*. S. XIII,
9-13; *Ri*k S. IV, 4, I-5),

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Put forth thy
power, like a broad army!' slayers of Rakshas are the counter-charms:
having, by means of these counter-charms, repelled the Rakshas, the
fiends, in every quarter, they (the gods) restored that body in a place
free from danger and devilry; and in like manner this Sacrificer,
having, by means of these counter-charms, repelled the Rakshas, the
fiends, in every quarter, now restores that body (of Agni) in a place
free from danger and devilry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:34">7:4:1:34</span></span>34. He
offers with ghee; for the ghee is a thunderbolt: by the thunderbolt he
thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends;--with fivefold-taken (ghee),--of
five layers consists the fire-altar; five seasons are a year, and the
year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so
much he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends;--with (five) verses
addressed to Agni, for the Rakshas-killing light is Agni: by Agni he
thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends;--with trish*t*ubh verses,--the
Trish*t*ubh is a thunderbolt: by the thunderbolt he thus repels the
Rakshas, the fiends. On each side (he offers) moving round: in every
quarter he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:35">7:4:1:35</span></span>35.
Behind the altar (he offers) while seated with his face towards the
east; then on the left (north) side (looking) to the south; then in
front (looking) to the west; then going round behind, (he offers) on the
right (south) side while sitting with his face towards the north. Thus
(he moves) to the right, for

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

that (leads) to the gods. Thereupon, going back, (he offers) while
sitting behind, with his face towards the east; and in this way that
performance of his takes place towards the east <span
id="fr_693"></span>[1](#fn_691.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:36">7:4:1:36</span></span>36. He
then lays down two offering-spoons,--the offering-spoons are arms <span
id="fr_694"></span>[2](#fn_692.md): it is his arms he thus restores to him
(Agni). And as to why offering-spoons (are laid down), it is because the
arms are offering-spoons,--that bowl and the handle are two, for there
are two of these arms. He lays them down at the (left and right) sides,
for these arms (of ours) are at the sides.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:37">7:4:1:37</span></span>37. On
the right (south) side he lays down one of kârshmarya (gmelina arborea)
wood. For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the
fiends, should destroy their sacrifice from the south. They saw that
Rakshas-killing tree, the Kârshmarya: having by that tree repelled the
Rakshas, the fiends, on the south, they spread that sacrifice in a place
free from danger and devilry. And in like manner the Sacrificer, having
by that tree repelled the Rakshas, the fiends, on the south, now spreads
that sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry. It (the spoon)
is filled with ghee;--the ghee is a thunderbolt: it is by the
thunderbolt he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends, on the south.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:38">7:4:1:38</span></span>38. On
the left (north) side he then lays down one of udumbara (ficus
glomerata) wood; for the Udumbara means strength, life-sap: strength,
life-sap he thus puts into him. It is filled with sour

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

curds,--sour curds are life-sap: it is life-sap he thus puts into him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:39">7:4:1:39</span></span>39.
And, again, why he lays down two offering-spoons. When Pra*g*âpati was
relaxed, Agni took his (Pra*g*âpati's) fiery spirit, and carried it off
to the south, and there stopped; and because after carrying (karsh) it
off he stopped (ud-ram), therefore the Kârshmarya (sprang up). And Indra
took his (Pra*g*âpati's) vigour and went away to the north: it became
the Udumbara tree.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:40">7:4:1:40</span></span>40. He
(Pra*g*âpati) said to those two, 'Come ye to me, and put back into me
that (substance) of mine wherewith ye have gone off!'--'Well then,
bestow thou all food here on us two!' they said.--'Well then, join me,
becoming these two arms of mine!'--'So be it!' He bestowed all food on
them, and they joined him, becoming those two arms of his: hence it is
by the arms that food is made, and by means of the arms that it is
eaten, for he (Pra*g*âpati) bestowed all food on the two arms.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:41">7:4:1:41</span></span>41. The
kârshmarya one he lays down on the right side, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIII,
13), 'By Agni's fiery spirit I settle thee!'--that fiery spirit of his
(Pra*g*âpati's) which Agni then took and carried off to the south, he
now puts back into him.--'Agni, the head, the summit of the sky, he, the
lord of the earth, animates the seeds of the waters,' for Agni indeed is
this (spoon). With a Gâyatrî verse (he performs),--Agni is Gâyatra: as
great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays
down that (spoon). It is filled with ghee, for ghee belongs to Agni:
with his own share, with his own life-sap he thus gratifies him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:42">7:4:1:42</span></span>42. He
then lays down the udumbara one on the

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

left (north) side, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 14), 'By Indra's vigour I
settle thee!' that vigour of his (Pra*g*âpati's) which Indra then took
and went away to the north, he now puts back into him.--(Vâ*g*. S. XIII,
15; *Ri*k S. X, 8, 6), 'Thou hast become the leader of the sacrifice,
and of the sphere to which thou tendest with propitious teams; the
light-giving head hast thou lifted to the sky; thy tongue, O Agni, hast
thou made the bearer of the offering;'--Indra indeed is this (spoon).
And as to its being a verse addressed to Agni, it is because it is the
performance of Agni (the fire-altar);--and a trish*t*ubh one, because
Indra is connected with the Trish*t*ubh; and Agni includes Indra and
Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he
thus lays it down. Moreover, all the gods are Indra and Agni, and Agni
belongs to all the deities: as great as Agni is, as great as is his
measure, with so much he thus lays it down. It is filled with sour
curds, for sour curds belong to Indra: with his own share, with his own
life-sap he thus gratifies him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:43">7:4:1:43</span></span>43.
Indra and Agni indeed are those two arms of his (Pra*g*âpati's): they
join him with fiery spirit and vigour. Where he (the Sacrificer) touches
(the ground with his arms), whilst viewing intently the gold man with

some lay them down sideways (from south to north), saying, 'Sideways run
these two arms (of ours).' Let him not do so, but let him lay them with
the bowl towards the front (east), for this Agni (altar) is built with
the head towards the front; and, besides, in this way the arms are
stronger. Separately he lays them down, separately he 'settles' them,
and separately he pronounces the Sûdadohas verse on them; for separate
are these two arms.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:4:1:45">7:4:1:45</span></span>45. As
to this they say, 'Let him make no arms to this (gold) man <span
id="fr_696"></span>[1](#fn_694.md), lest he should cause him to be
redundant; for these two spoons are (in lieu of) his arms.' Let him
nevertheless make (him with arms), for those two spoons are (merely)
after the manner of the two arms. Moreover, those two (arms of Agni) are
wings; and whatever forms, whatever stomas, whatever p*ri*sh*th*as,
whatever metres he will be applying to that fire-altar, that will be the
perfection, that will be the growth of those two: let him therefore make
arms to that (gold) man.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[363:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_680.md) Probably Sâma-v. S.
I, 99 (*Ri*k S. I, 69, 4), 'O Agni, lord of bovine food, child of
strength, grant unto us, O knower of beings, great glory!' See Weber,
Ind. Stud. XII, p. 148, note 2.

because, yena) the waters flow,--that is to say, the flowing of the
waters (rain, &c.) is a manifestation of eternal truth.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[364:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_682.md) See [p.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[364:2](sbe4163.htm#fr_683.md) Viz., the one the
Sacrificer wore round his neck during the initiation period. See [VI, 7,
1, 1](sbe4149.htm#6:7:1:1.md) seq.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[366:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_684.md) 'Sîmata*h*' would
rather seem to mean 'from the boundary line,' but the author here takes
'sîman' in the sense of (sîmanta) 'hair-line, parting of the hair, crown
of the head (Scheitel).'

<span id="fn_683"></span>[366:2](sbe4163.htm#fr_685.md) In the Sanskrit
participial (or gerundial) construction, the relation between the
primary and secondary notions is usually the reverse of ours,--thus 'he
rises in overspreading.'

<span id="fn_684"></span>[366:3](sbe4163.htm#fr_686.md) It is usually with
Indra that the Trish*t*ubh metre is connected--see part i, introduction,
p. xviii; *S*at. Br. IX, 4, 3, 7 (cf. VIII, 5, 1, 10)--the Trish*t*ubh
being also the emblem of the nobility (III, 4, 1, 10).

<span id="fn_685"></span>[366:4](sbe4163.htm#fr_687.md) See [p.
301](sbe4155.htm#page_301), note [3](sbe4155.htm#fn_563.md).

<span id="fn_686"></span>[367:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_688.md) Professor Weber,
Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 249, takes 'uttânam' in the sense of 'standing
erect,' with his face towards the east; but this surely must be a
mistake.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[367:2](sbe4163.htm#fr_689.md) Viz. both the gold
plate (the sun), which was laid down with the embossed or front side
downwards, and the gold man.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[368:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_690.md) Cf. [VI, 7, 1,
11](sbe4149.htm#6:7:1:11.md), where it is said that the immortal part of
the vital air of man streams out by upward breathings. Cf. [p.
359](sbe4162.htm#page_359), n. [1](sbe4162.htm#fn_673.md).

<span id="fn_689"></span>[369:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_691.md) That is, he sings
the Kitra-sâman, Sâma-v. I, 169 (Vâ*g*. S. XXVII, 39), 'With what favour
will the bright one, the ever-growing friend, be with us; with what
mightiest host?'

<span id="fn_690"></span>[371:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_692.md) See p. 53, note 2.
In the present instance, the sacrificial formulas themselves constitute
these charms. The five verses, only the first pâda of the first of which
is given in the text, are as follows:--

1\. Put forth thy power as (if it were) a broad host (or, net); go
forth, like a mighty king with his following, following up the swift
host! An archer thou art: pierce the Rakshas with thy fieriest (darts).

2\. Swiftly fly thy whirling (darts): fiercely burning attack thou
boldly! Unfettered, O Agni, with thy tongue pour forth on all sides
winged flames and firebrands.

3\. Thou, the most rapid, send forth thy spies: be thou an undaunted
protector to this people (from him) who planneth evil against us from
afar or from near by; O Agni, let none dare to attack us without thy
cognizance.

4\. Rise, O Agni, spread thyself out, and burn down the foes, O
sharp-darted: whosoever hath done us injury, burn him down, O flaming
one, like dry brushwood. <span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

5\. Stand up, O Agni; strike out for our sake, and manifest thy divine
powers! unstring the strong (arrows, or bows) of the goblins: crush the
enemies, be they kindred or strangers!

<span id="fn_691"></span>[373:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_693.md) The order in which
he offers would thus be,--west, north, east, (then going back along the
north and west sides) south, west.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[373:2](sbe4163.htm#fr_694.md) They are indeed of
an arm's length, with bowls of the shape and size of the hand, see part
i, p. 67, note 2.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[375:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_695.md) There seems to be
considerable difference of opinion between Kâtyâyana and Sâya*n*a
regarding this point of the ceremonial. The gold man lies stretched out
on his back with his head towards the east. According to Kâtyâyana,
XVII, 4, 10, he (the Sacrificer) is to lie down so as to cover the gold
man, but without actually touching him with his breast, and at the
extreme end of where the arms touch (the ground) he is to make two
marks, where the spoons are then to be laid down with the bowl towards
the east. Sâya*n*a, <span id="page_376">p. 376</span> on the other hand,
explains--'Let the Adhvaryu lay down the two spoons close to the breast
of the laid-down gold man. Having beheld (i.e. recognised)--or, whilst
beholding (?)--that man, where-ever the laid-down pair of spoons reaches
his breast there, having made a mark, let him lay down the two spoons:
that part of the breast doubtless is the place of those two (spoons, or
gods?) extolled as the arms.' Perhaps the text of this comment is
somewhat corrupt. The ceremony is apparently intended to symbolise the
identification of the Sacrificer with the sacrificial man, or the
sacrifice itself: The Sacrificer lies down so as to rest on his
forearms; the spoons being afterwards laid down on the marks left by the
fore-arms (and naturally running in an easterly direction).--For
Professor Weber's view, see [p. 367](#page_367), note [1](#fn_686.md).

<span id="fn_694"></span>[376:1](sbe4163.htm#fr_696.md) That is to say, Let
it be a gold statuette without arms.
