#### THE ABHISHE*K*ANÎYA <span id="fr_144"></span>[2](#fn_144.md), OR CONSECRATION CEREMONY.

### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:1">5:3:3:1</span></span>1. He
performs the initiation ceremony. On the day of preparation he seizes
the victim for Agni

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

and Soma. Having performed the offering of the omentum thereof; he
prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma <span
id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_145.md). Thereupon the offerings of the Divine
Quickeners (Devasû) are prepared.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:2">5:3:3:2</span></span>2. For
Savit*ri* Satyaprasava (of true impulse) he prepares a cake from
fast-grown (plâ*s*uka) rice <span id="fr_146"></span>[2](#fn_146.md), on
either twelve, or eight, potsherds; for Savit*ri* is the impeller
(prasavit*ri*) of the gods: 'May I be quickened <span
id="fr_147"></span>[3](#fn_147.md), impelled by Savit*ri*!' thus (he
thinks). And as to (its being) of fast-grown rice: 'May they quickly
impel me!' he thinks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:3">5:3:3:3</span></span>3. For
Agni G*ri*hapati (the house-lord) he then prepares a cake on eight
potsherds from quick-grown (â*s*u) rice <span
id="fr_148"></span>[4](#fn_148.md); for the house-lord's position means
prosperity: as much as he (the king) rules over, over

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

that Agni, the house-lord, leads him to hold the position of a master of
the house. And as to its being of quick-grown rice: 'May they quickly
lead me!' so he thinks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:4">5:3:3:4</span></span>4. For
Soma Vanaspati (the wood-lord or tree) he then prepares a pap of
*s*yâmâka millet: thereby Soma, the wood-lord, quickens him for the
plants. And as to its being prepared of *s*yâmâka,--they, the *s*yâmâkas
among plants doubtless are most manifestly Soma's own: therefore it is
prepared of *s*yâmâka grain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:5">5:3:3:5</span></span>5. For
B*ri*haspati Vâ*k* <span id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_149) (speech.md) he
then prepares a pap of wild rice: thereby B*ri*haspati quickens him for
speech. And as to its being prepared of wild rice,--B*ri*haspati is the
Brahman, and they, the wild rice-plants, are ripened by the
Brahman <span id="fr_150"></span>[2](#fn_150.md): hence it is prepared of
wild rice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:6">5:3:3:6</span></span>6. For
Indra *G*yesh*th*a (the most excellent) he then prepares a pap of red
rice-grains (hâyana) <span id="fr_151"></span>[3](#fn_151.md): thereby
Indra, the most excellent, leads him to excellence (or, lordship). And
as to its being prepared of red rice: outstanding doubtless are those
plants, the red rice, and outstanding is Indra: therefore it is prepared
of red rice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:7">5:3:3:7</span></span>7. For
Rudra Pa*s*upati (lord of beasts) he then prepares a Raudra pap of
gavedhukâ seeds (coix barbata): thereby Rudra, the lord of beasts,
quickens

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

him for cattle. And as to its being prepared of gavedhukâ seed;--that
God is (the recipient of) refuse (remains of offering), and gavedhukâ
seeds are refuse: therefore it is (prepared) of gavedhukâ seed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:8">5:3:3:8</span></span>8. For
Mitra Satya (the True) he then prepares a pap of Nâmba <span
id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_152.md) seed: thereby Mitra the True quickens
him for the Brahman. And as to its being prepared of Nâmba seed,--to
Varu*n*a, no doubt, belong those plants which grow in ploughed ground;
but those, the Nâmba plants, belong to Mitra: therefore it is (prepared)
of Nâmba seed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:9">5:3:3:9</span></span>9. For
Varu*n*a Dharmapati (the lord of the law) he then prepares a Varu*n*a
pap of barley: thereby Varu*n*a, the lord of the law, makes him lord of
the law; and that truly is the supreme state, when one is lord of the
law; for whosoever attains to the supreme state, to him they come in
(matters of) law: therefore to Varu*n*a Dharmapati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:10">5:3:3:10</span></span>10. He
then proceeds with the cake for Agni-Soma. The Svish*t*ak*ri*t of that
(oblation) remains yet unoffered, when he proceeds with those (other)
oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:11">5:3:3:11</span></span>11.
Thereupon, taking hold of him (the Sacrificer) by the right arm, he
mutters (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 39, 40), 'May Savit*ri* quicken thee for (powers
of) quickening (ruling) <span id="fr_153"></span>[2](#fn_153.md), Agni for
householders, Soma for trees, B*ri*haspati for speech, Indra for
lordship, Rudra for cattle, Mitra for truth, Varu*n*a for the lord of
the law.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:12">5:3:3:12</span></span>12.
'Quicken him, O gods, to be unrivalled!'

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --he thereby says,
'Quicken him, O gods, so as to be without an enemy; for great chiefdom,
for great lordship!' in this there is nothing obscure;--'for man-rule!'
'for the ruling of men,' he thereby says;--'for Indra's energy!' 'for
vigour' he means to say when he says, 'for Indra's energy;'--'him, the
son of such and such (a man), the son of such and such (a
woman),'--whatever be his parentage, with reference to that he says
this;--'of such and such a people,' that is to say, of the people whose
king he is;--'this man, O ye (people) <span
id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_154.md), is your king, Soma is the king of us
Brahmans!' He thereby causes everything here to be food for him (the
king); the Brâhman alone he excepts: therefore the Brâhman is not to be
fed upon, for he has Soma for his king.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:13">5:3:3:13</span></span>13. Now
those gods have the power of quickening, whence their name 'devasû'
(Divine Quickeners). It is those gods who now quicken him thus, and
quickened (consecrated) by them he will be consecrated on the morrow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:14">5:3:3:14</span></span>14.
They are double-named, for a coupling means strength: 'May the strong
quicken (him),' thus he thinks, and therefore they are double-named.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:3:15">5:3:3:15</span></span>15. He
now says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t.' And
as to why that ceremony is performed here between two offerings <span
id="fr_155"></span>[2](#fn_155.md),--verily Pra*g*âpati is that sacrifice
which is here performed, and from which all these creatures were
produced,--

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

and so they are even now produced after this one. Thus he places him
(the Sacrificer) in the very middle of that Pra*g*âpati, and quickens
him in the middle: this is why that ceremony is performed between two
offerings. Having called for the *S*rausha*t*. he says, 'Urge for Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t!' and offers as the Vasha*t* is pronounced.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_143"></span>[68:1](sbe4114.htm#fr_143.md) That is, by the
steam rising from the B*ri*haspati pap in the bottom vessel.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[68:2](sbe4115.htm#fr_144.md) The Abhishe*k*anîya
(or Abhisheka, literally 'the sprinkling'), the Consecration ceremony
(corresponding to the Anointment of modern times), requires for its
performance five days, viz. one dîkshâ (initiation ceremony), three
upasads, and one sutyâ or Soma-day, the particular form of
Soma-sacrifice being the Ukthya (part ii, p. 325, note 2). The Dîkshâ is
performed immediately after the expiration of the dark fortnight
following the full-moon of Phalgunî, that is to say, on the first day of
*K*aitra (about the middle of March).--According to Katy. XV, 3, 47 both
the Abhishe*k*anîya and Da*s*apeya require special offering-places, the
latter being north of the former. Cf. note on [V, 4, 5,
13](sbe4122.htm#5:4:5:13.md).--As regards <span id="page_69">p. 69</span>
the chants (stotra) of the Consecration ceremony, the Pavamâna-stotras
are chanted in the thirty-twofold, the Â*g*ya-stotras in the
fifteenfold, the P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras in the seventeenfold, and the
Agnish*t*oma-sâman and Uktha-stotras in the twenty-onefold mode of
chanting (stoma). Pa*ñk*. Br, 18, 10, 9. The Bahishpavamâna is specially
constructed so as to consist of the following parts,--Sâma-veda II,
978-80; further six so-called sambhâryâ verses further II, 125-27; II,
4-6; II, 431-3; II, 128-30; II, 555-59; II, 7-9; II, 981-83; see Pa*ñk*.
Br. 18, 8, 7 seq.--The Taittirîya ritual (Taitt. Br. I, 8, 7 seq.), on
the other hand, prescribes for the Pavamâna-stotras, the
thirty-four-versed stoma, commencing the Bahishpavamâna by II, 920; II,
431, &c.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[69:1](sbe4115.htm#fr_145.md) This is the ordinary
Pa*s*u-purodâ*s*a, or cake of animal (offering). See part ii, p. 199,
note 2 (where read Agni and Soma. instead of Indra and Agni).

<span id="fn_146"></span>[69:2](sbe4115.htm#fr_146.md) That is, according
to Sâya*n*a, rice which has sprung up again and ripens very rapidly.
Taitt. S. I, 8, 10 has 'â*s*u' instead, for which see [next
paragraph](sbe4115.htm#5:3:3:4.md).

<span id="fn_147"></span>[69:3](sbe4115.htm#fr_147.md) Or, consecrated
(sû).

<span id="fn_148"></span>[69:4](sbe4115.htm#fr_148.md) That is, according
to Sâya*n*a, rice ripening in sixty days. The Taitt. S. prescribes a
cake of black rice for Agni.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[70:1](sbe4115.htm#fr_149.md) B*ri*haspati Vâkpati
(lord of speech), according to the Black Ya*g*us, where the order of the
'Divine Quickeners' is moreover somewhat different.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[70:2](sbe4115.htm#fr_150.md) ? Or cooked by the
Brahman, that is by Brâhmans, when living the life of hermits or
ascetics.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[70:3](sbe4115.htm#fr_151.md) The Taitt. S.
prescribes a cake prepared of large rice (mahâvrîhi).

<span id="fn_152"></span>[71:1](sbe4115.htm#fr_152.md) The Taitt. S. and
Br. read 'âmba' instead, 'a kind of grain,' according to Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[71:2](sbe4115.htm#fr_153.md) Or, perhaps, 'on the
part of the quickeners (rulers, savânâm).'

<span id="fn_154"></span>[72:1](sbe4115.htm#fr_154.md) Here the name of the
people, e. g. 'O ye Kurus, O ye Pa*ñk*âlas!' is inserted. The Taitt. S.
reads, 'O ye Bharatâ*h*.'

<span id="fn_155"></span>[72:2](sbe4115.htm#fr_155.md) That is to say, the
oblations to the 'Divine Quickeners,' which were inserted between the
chief oblation of the (Agnîshomîya) pa*s*upurodâ*s*a and the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t of it; see above, [parag. 10](sbe4115.htm#5:3:3:10.md).
