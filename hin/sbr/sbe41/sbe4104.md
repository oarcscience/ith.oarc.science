### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:1">5:1:2:1</span></span>1. He
draws the A*ms*u <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35) (graha.md), just for
completeness’ sake, for it is [therefor](errata.htm#2.md) that he draws

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

the A*ms*u. After that he draws those recognised Agnish*t*oma cups <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) up to the Âgraya*n*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:2">5:1:2:2</span></span>2, He
then draws the P*ri*sh*th*yas <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md): and
whatever the gods (Agni, Indra, and Sûrya) won by them, even that he
wins by them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:3">5:1:2:3</span></span>3. He
then draws the Sho*d*a*s*in: and whatever Indra won thereby, even that
he (the sacrificer) wins thereby.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:4">5:1:2:4</span></span>4. He
then draws those five Vâ*g*apeya cups (for Indra; the first) with the
text (V. S. IX, 2), 'Thee, the firm-seated, the man-seated, the
mind-seated! Thou art taken with a support <span
id="fr_38"></span>[3](#fn_38.md): I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is
thy womb' (i.e. thy home): thee, most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he
deposits it; for of these

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

worlds this one, to wit the earth, is the firm one: this same world he
thereby wins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:5">5:1:2:5</span></span>5. \[The
second with,\] 'Thee, the water-seated, the ghee-seated, the
ether-seated! Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to
Indra! This is thy womb: thee most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he
deposits it; for among these worlds that ether (mentioned in the
formula) is this air: he thereby wins this air-world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:6">5:1:2:6</span></span>6. \[The
third with,\] 'Thee, the earth-seated, the air-seated, the sky-seated,
the god-seated, the heaven-seated! Thou art taken with a support: I take
thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to
Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for god-seated, heaven-seated indeed
is yonder world of the gods: the world of the gods he thereby wins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:7">5:1:2:7</span></span>7. \[The
fourth with V. S. IX, 3,\] 'The waters’ invigorating essence, being
contained in the sun,--that which is the essence of the waters’ essence,
that, the most excellent, I take for you! Thou art taken with a support:
I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable
to Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for the waters’ essence is he that
blows (or purifies) yonder (the wind), and he is contained in the sun,
he blows from the sun: that same essence he thereby wins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:8">5:1:2:8</span></span>8. \[The
fifth with IX, 4,\] 'Ye cups, of strengthening libations, inspiring the
sage with thought,--I have gathered together the pith and sap of you,
the handleless! Thou art taken with a support: thee, agreeable to Indra!
This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Indra!' therewith
he deposits it;--pith means essence: it is the essence he thereby wins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:9">5:1:2:9</span></span>9. These,
then, are five Vâ*g*apeya cups he draws; for he who offers the
Vâ*g*apeya wins Pra*g*âpati; and Pra*g*âpati is the year, and there are
five seasons in the year,--he thus wins Pra*g*âpati: therefore he draws
five Vâ*g*apeya cups.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:10">5:1:2:10</span></span>10. He
(the Adhvaryu) then draws seventeen (other) cups of Soma, and (the
Nesh*tri*) seventeen cups of Surâ (spirituous liquor), for to
Pra*g*âpati belong these two (saps of) plants, to wit the Soma and the
Surâ;--and of these two the Soma is truth, prosperity, light; and the
Surâ untruth, misery, darkness: both these (saps of) plants he thereby
wins; for he who offers the Vâ*g*apeya wins everything here, since he
wins Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati indeed is everything here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:11">5:1:2:11</span></span>11. Now
as to why he draws seventeen cups of Soma;--Pra*g*âpati is
seventeenfold, Pra*g*âpati is the sacrifice <span
id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md): as great as the sacrifice is, as great as
is

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

its measure, with that much he thus wins its truth, its prosperity, its
light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:12">5:1:2:12</span></span>12. And
why he draws seventeen cups of Surâ;--Pra*g*âpati is seventeenfold,
Pra*g*âpati is the sacrifice: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as
is its measure, with that much he thus wins its untruth, its misery, its
darkness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:13">5:1:2:13</span></span>13.
These two amount to thirty-four cups; for there are thirty-three gods,
and Pra*g*âpati is the thirty-fourth: he thus wins Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:14">5:1:2:14</span></span>14. Now
when he buys the king (Soma), he at the same time buys for a piece of
lead the Parisrut (immature spirituous liquor) from a long-haired man
near by towards the south. For a long-haired man is neither man nor
woman; for, being a male, he is not a woman; and being long-haired (a
eunuch), he is not a man. And that lead is neither iron nor gold; and
the Parisrut-liquor is neither Soma nor Surâ <span
id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md): this is why he buys the Parisrut for a
piece of lead from a long-haired man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:15">5:1:2:15</span></span>15. And
on the preceding day they prepare two

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

earth-mounds <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md), the one in front of
the axle, and the other behind the axle: 'Lest we should deposit
together the cups of Soma, and the cups of Surâ,'--this is why, on the
preceding day, they prepare two mounds, one in front, and the other
behind the axle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:16">5:1:2:16</span></span>16.
Now, when they take the Vasatîvarî water <span
id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42) (into the havirdhâna shed.md) by the front
door, the Nesh*tri* takes in the Parisrut-liquor by the back door. From
the south they bring in the drinking vessels. The Adhvaryu, seated in
front of the axle, with his face towards the west, draws the cups of
Soma; and the Nesh*tri*, seated behind the axle, with his face towards
the east, draws the cups of Surâ. The Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, the
Nesh*tri* a cup of Surâ; the Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, the Nesh*tri*
a cup of Surâ: in this way they draw them alternately.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:17">5:1:2:17</span></span>17.
Neither does the Adhvaryu hold the Soma-cup beyond the axle towards the
back, nor the Nesh*tri* the Surâ-cup beyond the axle towards the front,
thinking, 'Lest we should confound light and darkness!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:18">5:1:2:18</span></span>18. The
Adhvaryu holds the Soma-cup just over the axle, and the Nesh*tri* the
Surâ-cup just below

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

the axle, with (V. S. IX, 4), 'United ye are: unite me with happiness!'
Thinking, 'Lest we should say "evil",' they withdraw them again, with,
'Disunited ye are: disunite me from evil!' Even as one might tear a
single reed from a clump of reed-grass, so do they thereby tear him from
out of all evil: there is not in him so much sin as the point of a
grass-blade. They deposit the two (cups each time on the mounds).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:2:19">5:1:2:19</span></span>19.
Thereupon the Adhvaryu draws the Madhu-graha (honey-cup) in a golden
vessel, and deposits it in the middle of the Soma-grahas. He then draws
the Ukthya, then the Dhruva. And when, at the last chant (of the evening
press feast <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43).md), he has poured those
Soma-grahas one by one into the cups of the officiating priests, they
make offering and drink them. At the midday-pressing it is told
regarding the honey-cup, and the cups of Surâ: thereof then <span
id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_44.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_35"></span>[5:1](sbe4104.htm#fr_35.md) Regarding this cup, or
libation (consisting, it would seem, of imperfectly pressed Soma-plants
in water), see part ii, p. 424, note 1. Here, and in the sequel, the
author only refers to those points of ceremonial in which the
performance differs from that of the ordinary Agnish*t*oma sacrifice, as
described in part ii.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[6:1](sbe4104.htm#fr_36.md) Viz. the Upâ*ms*u and
Antaryâma; the Aindravâyava, Maitrâvaru*n*a and Â*s*vina; the *S*ukra
and Manthin; and the Âgraya*n*a. Part ii, pp. 256 seq.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[6:2](sbe4104.htm#fr_37.md) That is, the three
Atigrâhyas (part ii, p. 402, note 2), required for the
P*ri*sh*th*a-stotras at the midday feast, when performed in their proper
'p*ri*sh*th*a' form, as they are at the P*ri*sh*th*ya sha*d*aha, and at
a Vi*s*va*g*it-ekâha with all the P*ri*sh*th*as. See IV, 5, 4, 24. The
authorities of the Black Ya*g*us adopt a somewhat different arrangement.
The Vâ*g*apeya cups are likewise called by them Atigrâhyas (Taitt. S. I,
7, 22; T. B. I, 3, 9), and these are apparently drawn by them
immediately after the second of the ordinary three Atigrâhyas, the one
belonging to Indra (T. S. vol. i, p. 996,--but see ib. p. 1955, where it
is stated that they are drawn immediately after the Âgraya*n*a,--that
is, probably, if the ordinary Atigrâhyas are not required). Then follows
(the third ordinary Atigrâhya?), then the Sho*d*a*s*in, and thereupon
the seventeen cups for Pra*g*âpati.--Sâya*n*a remarks on our
passage,--teshâm (atigrâhyâ*n*âm) prak*ri*tigatâ tritvasa*m*khyaiva
*s*âkhântaravat sa*m*khyântarânupade*s*ât. MS. I. O. 657.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[6:3](sbe4104.htm#fr_38.md) For an explanation of
these notions, see part ii, p. 260, notes 1 and 2.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[8:1](sbe4104.htm#fr_39.md) See I, 5, 2, 17, where
the principal formulas used in making oblations are computed as
consisting together of seventeen syllables. Pa*ñk*. Br. 18, 6 insists
especially on the symbolic identity of Pra*g*âpati and the Vâ*g*apeya on
the double ground that the Vâ*g*apeya consists of seventeen stotras, and
has for its characteristic mode of chanting the Saptada*s*a-stoma, or
seventeen-versed hymn. That this is indeed so will appear from a glance
at the chief chants. The Bahishpavamâna-stotra, which in the ordinary
Agnish*t*oma is chanted in the triv*ri*t-stoma, consisting of three
triplets, or nine verses (see part ii, p. 310), is at the Vâ*g*apeya
made to consist of seventeen verses, by the insertion of eight verses
(S.V. II, 180-82; 186-90) between the second and third triplets. Again,
the Mâdhyandina-pavamâna, ordinarily chanted in fifteen verses (part ii,
p. 333), here consists of seventeen, viz. II, 105-7 (sung twice in two
tunes = six verses); II, 663 (one verse); II, 663-4 (sung as triplet, in
two tunes = six verses); [II, 663, in a different tune
again](errata.htm#3) (one verse.md); II, 821-23 <span id="page_9">p.
9</span> (three verses)--making together seventeen verses. Similarly,
the Ârbhava-pavamâna (chanted at the Agnish*t*oma also in the
Saptada*s*a-stoma, cf. part ii, p. 315; but here with modifications)
consists of II, 165-7 (sung twice in two tunes = six verses); II, 42, 44
(two verses); II, 47-9 (in two tunes = six verses); [II,
720-22](errata.htm#4) (three verses.md)--making together seventeen verses.
For the similarly constructed Vâ*g*apeya hymn see page 11, note 1. See
also Lâ*t*y. *S*r. VIII, 11, 15 seq., where the number of officiating
priests, as well as that of the various sacrificial fees, is fixed at
seventeen. Similarly, Â*s*v. *S*r. IX, 9, 2-3 says that there are either
to be seventeen dikshâs, or the whole ceremony is to be performed in
seventeen days.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[9:1](sbe4104.htm#fr_40.md) According to Sâya*n*a,
the difference between surâ and parisrut would seem to be that the
former beverage is prepared from mature shoots (of rice, &c.), and the
latter from such as are not quite ripe.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[10:1](sbe4104.htm#fr_41) The mounds (khara.md)
thrown up in the havirdhâna cart-shed, are used for placing the cups of
Soma (and Surâ) after they are drawn, until they are used for the
libations. See the plan of the sacrificial ground at the end of part ii;
only that on the present occasion there is to be a second mound, for the
placing of the Surâ-cups, under or just behind the axle of the southern
Soma-cart (in the place where the Nârâ*s*a*m*sa cups to the Fathers were
temporarily deposited at the Agnish*t*oma; see III, 6, 2, 25 with note).
On this occasion a small door is also made in the southern wall of the
cart-shed, by breaking through the hurdle.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[10:2](sbe4104.htm#fr_42.md) Part ii, p. 222 seq.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[11:1](sbe4104.htm#fr_43.md) The last chant (at the
evening feast) of the Vâ*g*apeya sacrifice is the so-called
Vâ*g*apeya-sâman, or B*ri*hat-stotra (Sâmav. II, 975-7), chanted, to the
B*ri*hat tune, in the Saptada*s*a-stoma; the three verses being, by
repetitions, raised to the number of seventeen.--'When he has poured . .
. they offer it:' this is apparently a case of the absolute construction
of the gerund in '-ya,' cf. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 108.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[11:2](sbe4104.htm#fr_44.md) On these cups, or
libations, see [V, I, 5, 28](sbe4107.htm#5:1:5:28.md).
