#### THE ANIMAL SACRIFICE <span id="fr_328"></span>[3](#fn_328.md).

### SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:1">6:2:1:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati set his mind upon Agni's forms. He searched for that boy
(Kumâra) who had entered

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

into the (different) forms. Agni became aware of it,--'Surely, Father
Pra*g*âpati is searching for me: well then, let me be suchlike that he
knows me not.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:2">6:2:1:2</span></span>2. He saw
those five animals,--the Purusha (man), the horse, the bull, the ram,
and the he-goat. Inasmuch as he saw (pa*s*) them, they are (called)
cattle (pa*s*u).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:3">6:2:1:3</span></span>3. He
entered into those five animals; he became those five animals. But
Pra*g*âpati still searched for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:4">6:2:1:4</span></span>4. He saw
those five animals. Because he saw (pa*s*) them, therefore they are
animals (pa*s*u); or rather, because he saw him (Agni) in them,
therefore they are animals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:5">6:2:1:5</span></span>5. He
considered, 'They are Agni: I will fit them unto mine own self <span
id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_329.md). Even as Agni, when kindled, glares, so
their eye glares; even as Agni's smoke rises upwards, so vapour rises
from them; even as Agni consumes what is put in him, so they devour;
even as Agni's ashes fall down, so do their faeces: they are indeed
Agni; I will fit them unto mine own self.' He meant to slaughter them
for different deities: the Purusha (man) for Vi*s*vakarman, the horse
for Varu*n*a, the bull for Indra, the ram for Tvash*tri*, the he-goat
for Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:6">6:2:1:6</span></span>6. He
considered, 'For different deities, indeed, I mean to slaughter now; but
I myself desire (kam)

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agni's forms: well
then, I will slaughter them for the Agnis, as for the (object of my)
desire.' He slaughtered them for the Agnis, as for (his) desire,--to
wit, 'for the Agnis,' because many were the forms of Agni he had set his
mind upon; and 'for the desire,' because it was with a desire that he
slaughtered them. Having appeased them and carried the fire round them,
he led them northwards and slew them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:7">6:2:1:7</span></span>7. He
considered, 'Those glories (signs of excellence <span
id="fr_330"></span>[1](#fn_330).md) upon which I have set my mind are
contained in the heads: well then, I will only put on the heads <span
id="fr_331"></span>[2](#fn_331.md).' He cut off the heads and put them on
(himself, or the altar). The remaining trunks he then let float on the
water  <span id="fr_332"></span>[3](#fn_332.md), and brought the sacrifice
to its completion by means of (the offering of) a he-goat, thinking,
'Lest my sacrifice be pulled to pieces.' After performing that animal
sacrifice, Pra*g*âpati saw that he had not yet reached the end of Agni
(the fire-altar).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:8">6:2:1:8</span></span>8. He
considered, 'I must search for that body <span
id="fr_333"></span>[4](#fn_333.md) which I let float on the water.' He
searched for it; and what (part) of those (bodies) cast into the water
had settled therein, that water he gathered; and what (had settled) in
this earth, that clay (he gathered) <span
id="fr_334"></span>[5](#fn_334.md). And having gathered both that clay

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

and water, he made a brick: hence a brick consists of these two, clay
and water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:9">6:2:1:9</span></span>9. He
considered, 'Surely, if I fit <span id="fr_335"></span>[1](#fn_335.md) this
(matter) such as it is unto mine own self, I shall become a mortal
carcase, not freed from evil: well then, I will bake it by means of the
fire.' So saying, he baked it by means of the fire, and thereby made it
immortal; for the sacrificial food which is baked by fire is indeed
immortal (or, ambrosia). Hence they bake the bricks with fire: they
thereby make them immortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:10">6:2:1:10</span></span>10. And
inasmuch as he saw them after offering (ish*t*vâ) the animal, therefore
they are bricks (ish*t*akâ). Hence one must make the bricks only after
performing an animal sacrifice; for those which are made before (or,
without) an animal sacrifice are 'anish*t*akâ <span
id="fr_336"></span>[2](#fn_336.md).' And, moreover, there is this other
(consideration).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:11">6:2:1:11</span></span>11. As
to those glories, they are these same heads of the victims; and those
(headless) trunks are these five layers (of the fire-altar): thus when
he builds up the layers after putting on the heads of the victims, he
thereby unites those trunks with those heads.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:12">6:2:1:12</span></span>12. And
because Agni is all those animal victims, therefore animals delight
(being) near the fire <span id="fr_337"></span>[3](#fn_337.md),--

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

there animals sport with animals. Hence the (sacrificial) fire is set up
with him who possesses cattle; for inasmuch as Agni (was) the same as
cattle, therefore Pra*g*âpati (the lord of creatures or generation)
became Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:13">6:2:1:13</span></span>13.
Here now some say, 'It is at this (point of the performance) that he
should offer up all those (five) victims; for had Pra*g*âpati then
offered up all of them, he would certainly have reached the end of the
fire (altar): hence were he (the Sacrificer) now to offer up all those
(victims) he would certainly reach the end of the fire (altar).' Let him
not do so: he thus would stray from where the gods have gone, he would
stray from the path;--and what would he then gather <span
id="fr_338"></span>[1](#fn_338.md)? For those same bodies, those layers, he
gathers: let him therefore not do so.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:14">6:2:1:14</span></span>14. Now
when he slaughters those animals, he prepares a home for Agni; for
nowhere but in his home does one enjoy himself. But the home means food:
it is that he lays down in, front, and when Agni sees that, he turns
unto him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:15">6:2:1:15</span></span>15.
There are a man, a horse, a bull, a ram, and a he-goat; for such are all
the animals (used for sacrifice). Animals are food: he thus lays down in
front whatever food there is; and seeing that, Agni turns unto him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:16">6:2:1:16</span></span>16.
There are five; for there are those five Agnis,

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

to wit, the five layers (of the fire-altar): for them he thus lays down
five homes; and seeing that, Agni turns unto him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:17">6:2:1:17</span></span>17. And
when (he offers) 'to the Agnis,'--it is because there are here many
Agnis, to wit, those layers; and when (he offers) 'to the desire,' it is
in order that the Sacrificer may obtain the object for which he performs
that ceremony.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:18">6:2:1:18</span></span>18. A
man (purusha) he slaughters first, for man is the first of animals; then
a horse, for the horse comes after man; then a bull, for the bull (or
cow) comes after the horse; then a ram, for the sheep comes after the
cow; then a he-goat, for the goat comes after the sheep: thus he
slaughters them according to their form, according to their excellence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:19">6:2:1:19</span></span>19.
Their ropes may be unequal; that of the man being the longest, then
shorter and shorter: thus he makes the ropes according to the form of
the animals, to avoid confusion between good and bad. But let them be
all alike, all similar; for all these victims are alike, all similar,
for they are (all) called Agnis, they are called food: hence they are
alike and similar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:20">6:2:1:20</span></span>20.
Here now they say, 'How is that complete five-bricked fire of his gained
in the animals?'--Well, in the kapâlas of the sacrificial cakes that
first brick, the earthen one, is obtained; and when he slaughters the
animal, thereby the animal brick is obtained, and when two gold chips
are (placed) on both sides of the omentum, thereby the gold brick is
obtained; and what firewood, stake, and enclosing sticks there are,
thereby the wooden brick is obtained; and what ghee, sprinkling-water,
and cake there are, thereby the fifth brick, the food, is

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

obtained: thus then that complete five-bricked fire of his is gained in
the animals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:21">6:2:1:21</span></span>21. For
these (victims) there are twenty-four kindling-verses <span
id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_339.md); for the year consists of twenty-four
half-moons, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is
his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:22">6:2:1:22</span></span>22.
And, again, why there are twenty-four,--the Gâyatrî consists of
twenty-four syllables, and Agni is Gâyatra <span
id="fr_340"></span>[2](#fn_340.md): as great as Agni is, as great as is his
measure, by so much he thus kindles him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:23">6:2:1:23</span></span>23.
And, again, why there are twenty-four,--man (purusha) doubtless is
twenty-fourfold: ten fingers of the hands, ten toes, and four limbs; and
Pra*g*âpati is the Purusha, and Pra*g*âpati is Agni: as great as Agni
is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:24">6:2:1:24</span></span>24. He
recites both gâyatrî and trish*t*ubh verses; for the gâyatrî metre is
the vital air, and the trish*t*ubh is the body (self): by the gâyatrî
verses he thus kindles his vital air, and by the trish*t*ubh ones the
body. The trish*t*ubh verses are in the middle, and the gâyatrî verses
on both sides thereof; for this body is in the middle, and the (organs
of) the vital airs are on the sides thereof. He pronounces more gâyatrî
verses before, and fewer after (the

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

trish*t*ubh verses); for there are more (organs of the) vital airs in
front, and fewer behind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:25">6:2:1:25</span></span>25. He
recites (Vâ*g*. S. XXVII, 1), 'May the months <span
id="fr_341"></span>[1](#fn_341.md), O Agni, may the seasons make thee
grow!' When Agni restored the relaxed Pra*g*âpati, he (Pra*g*âpati) said
to him, 'What kindling-verses there are equal to me (in measure), with
them kindle me!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:26">6:2:1:26</span></span>26. He
(Agni) saw these (verses), 'May the months, O Agni, may the seasons make
thee grow!' that is, 'May both the months, O Agni, and the seasons make
thee grow!'--'The years, the *Ri*shis, whatsoever truths' that is, 'May
the years, and the *Ri*shis, and the truths make thee grow!'--'With
heavenly brightness do thou shine!'--the heavenly brightness doubtless
is yonder sun: thus 'together with that do thou shine!'--'lighten up the
whole four regions!' that is, 'lighten up all the four regions!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:27">6:2:1:27</span></span>27.
These (verses) have one and the same explanation regarding him
(Agni-Pra*g*âpati): how one would make him complete, how he would
restore and produce him. They relate to Agni and Pra*g*âpati: to Agni,
inasmuch as Agni saw (them); to Pra*g*âpati, inasmuch as he (Agni)
kindled Pra*g*âpati.

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:28">6:2:1:28</span></span>28.
Twelve Âprî (propitiatory) verses <span id="fr_342"></span>[1](#fn_342.md)
there are,--twelve months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as
Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus propitiates
(or gratifies) him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:29">6:2:1:29</span></span>29.
And, again, why there are twelve,--of twelve syllables consists the
*G*agatî, and the *G*agatî is this earth, for on her there is everything
that moves (*g*ag-at) here. And Agni also is this earth, for it is out
of her that the whole fire (altar) is built up: as great as Agni is, as
great as is his measure, by so much he thus propitiates him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:30">6:2:1:30</span></span>30.
And, again, why there are twelve,--of twelve syllables consists the
*G*agatî, and the *G*agatî is all the metres, and all the metres are
Pra*g*âpati (the sacrifice), and Pra*g*âpati is Agni: as great as Agni
is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus propitiates him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:31">6:2:1:31</span></span>31.
Those 'kindling-sticks of his (Agni) are upright.' When Agni restored
the relaxed Pra*g*âpati, he said to him, 'What Âprî-verses there are
equal to me, with them propitiate me!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:32">6:2:1:32</span></span>32. He
saw these (verses) <span id="fr_343"></span>[2](#fn_343.md):--'Upright are
his kindling-sticks,' for upright indeed are the kindling-sticks of him
when kindled;--'upwards tending the bright flashes of Agni,' for tending
upwards are his bright flashes, his flames;--'they, the most brilliant,'
that is 'the most powerful;'--'of the fair-looking son,' for
fair-looking indeed Agni is on all sides; and inasmuch as he (the
Sacrificer) produces him thereby he (Agni) is his son.

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:33">6:2:1:33</span></span>33.
These (verses) have one and the same explanation regarding him
(Agni-Pra*g*âpati): how one would make him complete, how he would
restore and produce him. They relate to Agni and Pra*g*âpati,--to Agni,
inasmuch as Agni saw (them); to Pra*g*âpati, inasmuch as he (Agni)
propitiated Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:34">6:2:1:34</span></span>34.
They are unequal, and consist of unequal feet, and unequal syllables;
for the metres are unequal: whatever unequal limbs there are at his
(Agni's) body, those (limbs) of his he propitiates by these (verses).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:35">6:2:1:35</span></span>35. The
animal cake belongs to (Agni) Vai*s*vânara--Vai*s*vânara being all the
fires--for the obtainment of all the fires.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:36">6:2:1:36</span></span>36. As
to why it belongs to Vai*s*vânara;--those layers (of the altar) no doubt
are the seasons, for the seasons are the fires; and the seasons are the
year, and the year is Vai*s*vânara (belonging to all men). Were it
(offered) to Agni (Vai*s*vânara), he would cause it (the formula) to be
redundant. It is one on twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and
the year is Vai*s*vânara. The offering and invitatory formulas relate to
Agni, for the obtainment of Agni's forms. They contain the word 'kâma'
(desire), for the obtainment of his desires.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:37">6:2:1:37</span></span>37. Now
some, having in that way <span id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_344.md) obtained
those heads, put them on (the fire-altar), thinking, 'Either way <span
id="fr_345"></span>[2](#fn_345.md) are they animals.' But they (who do
this) become mortal carcases, for unpropitiated are

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

those (heads) of theirs. In this way, indeed, they did put them on for
Ashâ*dh*i Sau*s*romateya <span id="fr_346"></span>[1](#fn_346.md); but
quickly indeed he died after that.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:38">6:2:1:38</span></span>38.
Some, however, make gold ones, saying, 'They are immortal bricks
(am*ri*tesh*t*akâ).' But indeed those are false bricks
(an*ri*tesh*t*akâ), those are no heads of victims.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:2:1:39">6:2:1:39</span></span>39.
Some, again, make earthen ones, thinking, 'Passed away, forsooth, are
these animals, and this earth is the shelter of all that has passed
away: thus whither those animals have gone, from thence we collect
them.' Let him not do so, for whoso knows not both the practice and
theory of these (victims), for him let them be passed away. Let him
slaughter those very five victims, as far as he may be able to do so;
for it was these Pra*g*âpati was the first to slaughter, and
*S*yâpar*n*a Sâyakâyana the last; and in the interval also people used
to slaughter them. But nowadays only these two are slaughtered, the one
for Pra*g*âpati, and the one for Vâyu. The theory of these two is now
(to be) told.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_328"></span>[161:3](sbe4131.htm#fr_328.md) This is the
so-called ish*t*akâ-pa*s*u, or animal sacrifice performed with regard to
the bricks; the heads of the victims being used in building up the
altar, whilst some of the blood is mixed with the clay of which the
bricks are made.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[162:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_329.md) Or, I will make
them part of mine own self.--Similarly St. Petersburg dictionary, 'I
will change them into myself.' But differently Professor Delbrück,
Altind. Synt., p. 239, 'I will make myself to be these, change myself
into these.' This is on account of the middle form of the verb, which,
however, is quite justified also in the former interpretation. Cf. [VI,
8, 2, 1](sbe4154.htm#6:8:2:1.md), where there is no question of changing
the whole sacrifice into a heap of ashes, but of taking over the ashes,
or some of it, to form part of the sacrifice.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[163:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_330.md) See [VI, 1, 1,
4](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:4.md).

<span id="fn_331"></span>[163:2](sbe4131.htm#fr_331.md) That is, on the
fire-altar, or (which is the same thing) on himself, Pra*g*âpati, the
sacrifice. The heads of the five victims are placed in (a dish
introduced into) the bottom layer of the altar so as to impart stability
to it. See [VII, 5, 2, 1](sbe4166.htm#7:5:2:1.md) seq.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[163:3](sbe4131.htm#fr_332.md) Or, he washed them,
cleaned them, in water.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[163:4](sbe4131.htm#fr_333.md) Literally, that
self, i.e. that part of mine own self, the sacrifice (?).

<span id="fn_334"></span>[163:5](sbe4131.htm#fr_334.md) It seemed desirable
here to leave the construction of the original text unchanged.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[164:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_335.md) Sâya*n*a explains
'abhisa*m*skarishye' by 'âdhiya*gñ*ike *s*arîra upadhâsyâmi,' 'if I were
to put this (clay and water) on the sacrificial body.'

<span id="fn_336"></span>[164:2](sbe4131.htm#fr_336.md) A play on the word
which may mean either 'non-bricks,' or 'being without oblation
(ish*t*a).'

<span id="fn_337"></span>[164:3](sbe4131.htm#fr_337.md) Sâya*n*a seems to
take this to mean, that animals (cattle) delight, or sport, when the
sacrificial fire is established; that is to say, they feel at home and
increase wherever a new household is established (?);--tasmâd agnâv
âhite pa*s*avo ramante, âtmany eva sâ prîtir ity abhiprâya*h*.
Adhunâ<sup>ऽ</sup>gne*h* pa*s*ushv âtmabhûteshu prîti*m* <span
id="page_165">p. 165</span> dar*s*ayann âha, yasmâd agnir esha yat

<span id="fn_338"></span>[165:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_338.md) That is, what
'sambhâras' or equipments of the fire should he then collect? Cf. part
i, p. 276.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[167:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_339.md) For the eleven
gâyatrî verses, used as sâmidhenîs at an ordinary ish*t*i--and raised to
the number of fifteen by repetitions of the first and last verses--see
part i, p. 102. The present animal sacrifice (ish*t*akâ-pa*s*u) adds to
these verses nine trish*t*ubh verses (Vâ*g*. S. XXVII, 1-9), which
(according to Kâty. XVI, 1, 11) are to be inserted between the two
verses containing the words 'samidhyamâna' (being kindled) and
'samiddha' (kindled) respectively,--that is, between the ninth and tenth
of the normal or gâyatrî kindling-verses (cf. I, 4, 1, 38).

<span id="fn_340"></span>[167:2](sbe4131.htm#fr_340.md) See [VI, 1, 1,
15](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:15); [3, 19](sbe4130.htm#6:1:3:19.md).

<span id="fn_341"></span>[168:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_341.md) This is the meaning
assigned here to 'samâ*h*' by Mahîdhara, a doubtful meaning indeed.
Besides the ordinary meaning year,' the St. Petersburg dictionary also
allows to 'samâ' that of 'half-year' in some passages of the
Atharva-veda. In the present passage, the dictionary refers 'samâ*h*' to
the adjective 'sama,' hence 'the equal seasons.' This cannot, however,
have been the meaning assigned to the word by the author of this part of
the Brâhma*n*a, whatever it may originally have been in this verse of
the Sa*m*hitâs. Sâya*n*a, Taitt. S. IV, 1, 7, takes 'samâ*h*' in the
sense of 'the years,' but remarks that 'the months and half-months' have
to be understood by it in this verse.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[169:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_342.md) For the purport of
these verses which form the offering-prayers at the fore-offerings of
the animal sacrifice, see part ii, p. 185, note 1.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[169:2](sbe4131.htm#fr_343.md) Vâ*g*. S. XXVII, II
seq.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[170:1](sbe4131.htm#fr_344.md) That is, according
