### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:1">6:1:2:1</span></span>1. That
Pra*g*âpati desired, 'May it multiply, may it be reproduced!' By means
(or, in the form) of Agni he entered into union with the Earth: thence
an egg arose. He touched it: 'May it grow! May it grow and multiply!' he
said.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:2">6:1:2:2</span></span>2. And
the embryo which was inside was created as Vâyu (the wind). And the tear
which had formed itself became those birds. And the juice which was
adhering to the shell became those sun-motes. And that which was the
shell became the air.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:3">6:1:2:3</span></span>3. He
desired, 'May it multiply, may it reproduce itself!' By means of Vâyu he
entered into union with the Air: thence an egg arose. He touched it,
saying, 'Bear thou glory!' From it yonder sun was created, for he indeed
is glorious. And the tear which (a*s*ru) formed itself became that
variegated pebble (a*s*man); for 'a*s*ru' indeed is what

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

they mystically call 'a*s*man,' for the gods love the mystic. And the
juice which was adhering to the shell became those sunbeams. And that
which was the shell became the sky.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:4">6:1:2:4</span></span>4. He
desired, 'May it multiply, may it reproduce itself!' By means of the Sun
he entered into union with the Sky: thence an egg arose. He touched it,
saying, 'Bear thou seed!' From it the moon was created, for he (the
moon) is seed. And the tear which formed itself became those stars. And
the juice which was adhering to the shell became those intermediate
quarters; and that which was the shell became those (chief) quarters
(points of the compass).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:5">6:1:2:5</span></span>5. Having
created these worlds, he desired, 'May I create such creatures as shall
be mine in these worlds!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:6">6:1:2:6</span></span>6. By his
Mind (manas) he entered into union with Speech (vâ*k*): he became
pregnant with eight drops. They were created as those eight Vasus <span
id="fr_297"></span>[1](#fn_297): he placed them on this (earth.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:7">6:1:2:7</span></span>7. By his
Mind he entered into union with Speech: he became pregnant with eleven
drops. They were created as those eleven Rudras <span
id="fr_298"></span>[2](#fn_298.md): he placed them in the air.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:8">6:1:2:8</span></span>8. By his
Mind he entered into union with Speech: he became pregnant with twelve
drops. They were created as the twelve Âdityas <span
id="fr_299"></span>[3](#fn_299.md): he placed them in the sky.

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:9">6:1:2:9</span></span>9. By his
Mind he entered into union with Speech: he became pregnant. He created
the All-gods: he placed them in the quarters.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:10">6:1:2:10</span></span>10. And
so they say, 'After Agni having been created, the Vasus were created: he
placed them on this (earth);--after Vâyu, the Rudras: (he placed) them
in the air;--after the sun, the Âdityas: (he placed) them in the
sky;--after the moon, the All-gods <span
id="fr_300"></span>[1](#fn_300.md): he placed them in the quarters.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:11">6:1:2:11</span></span>11. And
so they say, 'Pra*g*âpati, having created these worlds, was firmly
established on the earth. For him these plants were ripened <span
id="fr_301"></span>[2](#fn_301.md) into food: that he ate. He became
pregnant. From the upper vital airs he created the gods, and from the
lower vital airs the mortal creatures.' In whatever way he created
thereafter, so he created; but indeed it was Pra*g*âpati who created
everything here, whatsoever exists.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:12">6:1:2:12</span></span>12.
Having created creatures he, having run the whole race, became
relaxed <span id="fr_302"></span>[3](#fn_302.md); and therefore even now he
who runs the whole race becomes indeed

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

relaxed. From him being thus relaxed, the vital air went out from
within. When it had gone out of him the gods left him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:13">6:1:2:13</span></span>13. He
said to Agni, 'Restore me!'--'What will then accrue to me?' said
he.--'They shall call me after thee; for whichever of the sons succeeds
(in life), after him they call the father, grandfather, son, and
grandson: they shall call me after thee,--restore me, then!'--'So be
it!' so (saying) Agni restored him: therefore, while being Pra*g*âpati,
they call him Agni; and verily, whosoever knows this, after him they
call his father, grandfather, son, and grandson.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:14">6:1:2:14</span></span>14. He
said, 'Whereon shall we set thee up <span
id="fr_303"></span>[1](#fn_303.md)?'--'On the hita (set, or suitable,
good)!' he said: the vital air is indeed something good, for the vital
air is good for all beings. And inasmuch as he set him up on the hita,
therefore one says, 'I shall set up, I am setting up, I have set
up <span id="fr_304"></span>[2](#fn_304.md).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:15">6:1:2:15</span></span>15. As
to this they say, 'What is hita, and what is upahita?' The vital air,
forsooth, is the 'hita,' and speech is the 'upahita,' for it is on the
vital air that this speech is based (upa-hitâ). The vital air, again, is
the 'hita,' and the limbs are the 'upahita,' for on the vital air these
limbs are indeed based.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:16">6:1:2:16</span></span>16.
This, then, was his (Pra*g*âpati's) '*k*itya' (Agni to be set up on an
altar-pile); for he had to be built up (*k*i) by him, and therefore was
his '*k*itya.' And

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

so indeed he now is the Sacrificer's '*k*itya;' for he is to be built up
by him, and therefore is his '*k*itya.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:17">6:1:2:17</span></span>17. Now
it was those five bodily parts (tanu) of his (Pra*g*âpati's) that became
relaxed,--hair, skin, flesh, bone, and marrow,--they are these five
layers (of the fire-altar); and when he builds up the five layers,
thereby he builds him up by those bodily parts; and inasmuch as he
builds up (*k*i), therefore they are layers (*k*iti).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:18">6:1:2:18</span></span>18. And
that Pra*g*âpati who became relaxed is the year; and those five bodily
parts of his which became relaxed are the seasons; for there are five
seasons, and five are those layers: when he builds up the five layers,
he thereby builds him up with the seasons; and inasmuch as he builds up
(lays down), therefore they are layers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:19">6:1:2:19</span></span>19. And
that Pra*g*âpati, the year, who became relaxed, is that very Vâyu (wind)
who blows yonder. And those five bodily parts of his, the seasons, which
became relaxed, are the regions (or quarters) <span
id="fr_305"></span>[1](#fn_305.md); for five in number are the regions, and
five those layers: when he builds up the five layers, he builds him up
with the regions; and inasmuch as he builds up, therefore they are
layers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:20">6:1:2:20</span></span>20. And
the Fire that is laid down on the built (altar), that is yonder
Sun;--that same Agni is indeed (raised) on the altar, and that just
because Agni had restored him (Pra*g*âpati).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:21">6:1:2:21</span></span>21. But
they say,--Pra*g*âpati, when relaxed, said to the gods, 'Restore me!'
The gods said to Agni, 'In thee we will heal this our father
Pra*g*âpati.'--

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Then I will enter
into him, when whole,' he said.--'So be it!' they said. Hence, while
being Pra*g*âpati, they yet call him Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:22">6:1:2:22</span></span>22. In
the fire the gods healed him by means of oblations; and whatever
oblation they offered that became a baked brick and passed into him. And
because they were produced from what was offered (ish*t*a), therefore
they are bricks (ish*t*akâ). And hence they bake the bricks by means of
the fire, for it is oblations they thus make.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:23">6:1:2:23</span></span>23. He
spake, 'Even as much as ye offer, even so much is my happiness:' and
inasmuch as for him there was happiness (ka) in what was offered
(ish*t*a), therefore also they are bricks (ish*t*akâ).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:24">6:1:2:24</span></span>24.
Here now Âktâkshya used to say, 'Only he who knows abundant bricks
possessed of (special) prayers, should build up the fire (altar):
abundantly indeed he then heals Father Pra*g*âpati.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:25">6:1:2:25</span></span>25. But
Tâ*nd*ya used to say, 'Surely the bricks possessed of prayers are the
nobility, and the space-fillers <span id="fr_306"></span>[1](#fn_306.md)
are the peasants; and the noble is the feeder, and the peasantry the
food; and where there is abundant food for the feeder, that realm is
indeed prosperous and thrives: let him therefore pile up abundant
space-fillers!' Such then was the speech of those two, but the settled
practice is different therefrom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:26">6:1:2:26</span></span>26. Now
that father (Pra*g*âpati) is (also) the son:

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

inasmuch as he created Agni, thereby he is Agni's father; and inasmuch
as Agni restored him, thereby Agni is his (Pra*g*âpati's) father; and
inasmuch as he created the gods, thereby he is the father of the gods;
and inasmuch as the gods restored him, thereby the gods are his fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:27">6:1:2:27</span></span>27.
Twofold verily is this,--father and son, Pra*g*âpati and Agni, Agni and
Pra*g*âpati, Pra*g*âpati and the gods, the gods and Pra*g*âpati--(for)
whosoever knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:28">6:1:2:28</span></span>28. He
builds up with <span id="fr_307"></span>[1](#fn_307.md), 'By that
deity'--that deity, doubtless, is Vâ*k*
(speech),--'Aṅgiras-like,'--Aṅgiras, doubtless, is the breath;--'lie
thou steady!'--that is, 'lie thou firm;' or 'lie thou firmly
established.' It is both with speech and with breath that he builds; for
Agni is speech, and Indra is the breath; and the fire (agni) relates to
Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so
much he thus builds him up. And again, Indra and Agni are all the gods,
(for) Agni belongs to all deities: thus as great as Agni is, as great as
is his measure, by so much he thus builds him up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:29">6:1:2:29</span></span>29.
Here now they say, 'Wherefore is Agni (the fire-altar) built of this
(earth)?' But, surely, when that deity (Pra*g*âpati) became relaxed
(fell asunder), he flowed along this (earth) in the shape of his
life-sap; and when the gods restored him (put him together), they
gathered him up from this earth: this earth then is that one brick <span
id="fr_308"></span>[2](#fn_308.md), for Agni is this earth, since

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

it is thereof <span id="fr_309"></span>[1](#fn_309.md) that the whole Agni
is built up. Now this earth is four-cornered, for the quarters are her
corners: hence the bricks are four-cornered; for all the bricks are
after the manner of this earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:30">6:1:2:30</span></span>30. As
to this they say, 'But if he (Agni) thus consists of one brick, how then
(comes he to be) a five-bricked <span id="fr_310"></span>[2](#fn_310.md)
one?' Now surely the first brick of clay is this earth,--whatever made
of clay he places on that (altar) that is that one brick. And when he
puts thereon the heads of the animal victims <span
id="fr_311"></span>[3](#fn_311.md), that is the animal-brick. And when he
puts on the gold plate and man <span id="fr_312"></span>[4](#fn_312.md),
when he scatters gold shavings thereon, that is the golden brick. And
when he puts on two spoonfuls (of ghee) <span
id="fr_313"></span>[5](#fn_313.md) when he puts on the mortar and
pestle <span id="fr_314"></span>[6](#fn_314.md), and fire-sticks, that is
the wood-brick. And when he puts on a lotus-leaf (petal), a
tortoise <span id="fr_315"></span>[7](#fn_315.md), sour curds, honey, ghee,
and whatever other food he puts on, that is the fifth brick, the food.
Thus, then, it is a five-bricked (Agni).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:31">6:1:2:31</span></span>31. As
to this they say, 'On which side is the head of the brick?'--'Where he
touches it and says a prayer,' so say some, 'on one end of the naturally
perforated (brick) <span id="fr_316"></span>[8](#fn_316.md) alone indeed
should he

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

say a prayer while touching it, but thus all those (bricks) of his are
turned towards the naturally perforated one.' Let him not do so, for
those bricks doubtless are his (Agni's) limbs, his joints; and it would
be just as if he were to put a head on each limb, on each joint. But
indeed, the fire which is deposited on the pile, that is the head of all
those (bricks).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:32">6:1:2:32</span></span>32.
Here they say, 'How many animal victims are laid upon the fire
(altar)?'--Let him say 'Five,' for he does lay thereon those five
victims.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:33">6:1:2:33</span></span>33. Or,
'One,' he may say; 'a ewe;' for a ewe (avi) is this earth, since she
favours (av) all these creatures. And the fire (altar) also is this
earth, for the whole fire (altar) is built up thereof: hence he may say,
'One.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:34">6:1:2:34</span></span>34. Or,
'Two,' he may say, 'two sheep;' for sheep, indeed, are both this (earth)
and that (sky), since these two favour all these creatures;--what clay
(there is in the brick) that is this earth; and what water there is that
is that sky; and the bricks consist of clay and water: therefore he may
say, 'Two.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:35">6:1:2:35</span></span>35. Or
he may say, 'A cow (or bullock, go);--'the cow forsooth means these
worlds, for whatever walks (gam) that walks in these worlds <span
id="fr_317"></span>[1](#fn_317.md); and that

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

fire also is these worlds: therefore he may say, 'A cow.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:2:36">6:1:2:36</span></span>36. As
to this they say, 'For what object is this fire (altar) built? Having
become a bird, he (Agni) shall bear me to the sky!' so say some; but let
him not think so; for by assuming that form, the vital airs became
Pra*g*âpati <span id="fr_318"></span>[1](#fn_318.md); by assuming that
form, Pra*g*âpati created the gods <span
id="fr_319"></span>[2](#fn_319.md); by assuming that form, the gods became
immortal and what thereby the vital airs, and Pra*g*âpati, and the gods
became, that indeed he (the Sacrificer) thereby becomes.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_297"></span>[149:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_297.md) As here, this class
of deities--whose sphere of action are the terrestrial regions--was
associated with Agni, the guardian of the earth, at III, 4, 2, 1.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[149:2](sbe4129.htm#fr_298.md) Another class of
(storm) deities, here associated with Vâyu, the wind, the guardian of
the air-region.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[149:3](sbe4129.htm#fr_299.md) This class of
deities (of light) are here associated with the <span id="page_150">p.
150</span> Sun, who indeed is called the Âditya in paragraphs
[4](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:4) and [10](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:10.md) (instead of
Sûrya).

<span id="fn_300"></span>[150:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_300.md) Professor Weber
(Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 268) has drawn attention to the discrepancy between
this passage and III, 4, 2, 1, where the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* (with
B*ri*haspati) are denied the privilege of forming a special class of
deities,--this being one of many points of difference, doctrinal as well
as linguistic, between Books 1-5 and 6-10.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[150:2](sbe4129.htm#fr_301.md) Professor Delbrück,
Altind. Synt. p. 147, reads 'apa*k*anta,'--the plants matured fruit.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[150:3](sbe4129.htm#fr_302.md) Literally, he fell
asunder, or to pieces, became disjointed. Hence, when the gods
'restored' Pra*g*âpati (the lord of generation, identified with the
sacrifice, and with Agni, the fire), the verb used is *s*a*m*sk*ri*; 'to
put together;' and this putting together, or restoration, of Pra*g*âpati
is symbolically identified with the building up of the fire-altar.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[151:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_303.md) Upa-dhâ. Paragraphs
[14](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:14) and [15](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:15.md) involve a
double meaning of the word hita, the past participle of dhâ, to
put,--viz. put, set, or suitable, beneficial.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[151:2](sbe4129.htm#fr_304.md) Or, 'I shall put
on,' &c., upa-dhâ, the verb used of the putting on of bricks in building
up the altar. Cf. II, 1, 2, 15.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[152:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_305.md) That is, the four
quarters, or cardinal points of the compass; and the upper region, or
rather the upward (or perpendicular) direction.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[153:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_306.md) In
contradistinction to the ya*g*ushmatî (prayerful) bricks, which bear
special names, and have special formulas attached to them; lokam-p*rin*â
(space-filling ones) is the technical term for those bricks which have
no special prayers belonging to them, but are piled up with a common
formula (Vâ*g*. S. XII, 54; Sat. Br. VIII, 7, 2, 1 seq.), beginning
'lokam p*rin*a *kh*idram p*ri*na,' 'fill the space, fill the gap!'

<span id="fn_307"></span>[154:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_307.md) This is the formula
(Vâ*g*. S. XII, 53) with which the so-called 'sâdanam' or 'settling' of
the bricks is performed. See [VII, 1, 1, 30](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:30.md).

<span id="fn_308"></span>[154:2](sbe4129.htm#fr_308.md) That is, the first
brick which the wife of the Sacrificer herself forms, and which is
called Ashâ*dh*â. See [VI, 3, 1, 1](sbe4134.htm#6:3:1:1.md); [5, 3,
1](sbe4143.htm#6:5:3:1.md).

<span id="fn_309"></span>[155:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_309.md) Viz. by means of
the clay bricks, and the loose soil put between the layers.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[155:2](sbe4129.htm#fr_310.md) Sâya*n*a only
refers here to the fact that the sacrifice (ya*gñ*a) is called 'pâṅkta,'
'the fivefold.'

<span id="fn_311"></span>[155:3](sbe4129.htm#fr_311.md) See [VII, 5, 2,
1](sbe4166.htm#7:5:2:1.md) seq.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[155:4](sbe4129.htm#fr_312.md) See [VII, 4, 1,
15](sbe4163.htm#7:4:1:15.md) seq.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[155:5](sbe4129.htm#fr_313.md) See [VII, 4, 1,
32](sbe4163.htm#7:4:1:32.md) seq.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[155:6](sbe4129.htm#fr_314.md) See [VII, 5, 1,
12](sbe4165.htm#7:5:1:12.md) seq.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[155:7](sbe4129.htm#fr_315.md) See [VII, 5, 1,
1](sbe4165.htm#7:5:1:1.md) seq.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[155:8](sbe4129.htm#fr_316.md) Apparently some
kind of porous stone. Three such perforated stones or 'bricks' are used
in the construction of the fire-altar; viz. one which is laid on the
gold man in the centre of the bottom layer (a sâman relating to bhûs,
the earth, being pronounced <span id="page_156">p. 156</span> on it
while touching it); the second in the centre of the third layer; and the
third one being laid upon the centre of the completed fifth layer. They
are meant to represent the three worlds, the holes being intended to
afford to the Sacrificer (represented by the gold man) a passage to the
highest regions. See [VI, 2, 3, 1](sbe4133.htm#6:2:3:1.md) seq.

<span id="fn_317"></span>[156:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_317.md) It is not quite
clear whether the author indulges in etymological trifling (go--gû). The
Bombay MS. of Sâya*n*a reads,--imâ*m*stallokân ga*kkh*atîti
kavana(?gavana)karmasâdhana*m* go*s*abda*m* dar*s*ayati.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[157:1](sbe4129.htm#fr_318.md) See [VI, 1, 1,
2](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:2.md) seq., where the seven vital airs are represented
as assuming the form of a bird--the Purusha Pra*g*âpati.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[157:2](sbe4129.htm#fr_319.md) See paragraphs
[7](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:7)-[11](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:11.md).
