Its svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t remains yet unoffered, when he (the Adhvaryu) brings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> him (the Sacrificer) some food; for he who offers the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya wins food, v&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya being the same as anna-peya: thus whatever food he (the Sacrificer) has thereby gained, that he (the Adhvaryu) now brings to him.</p>

In a vessel of udumbara wood--the Udumbara tree being sustenance, (that is) food--for the obtainment of sustenance, food: therefore it is in a vessel of udumbara wood.

<p>saying, 'Seventeenfold is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.' But let him not do so: surely all the food is not appropriated to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and, compared to him, what is man that he should appropriate to himself all food? Hence, while bringing every kind of food that occurs to him, let him not bring of some one (particular) kind of food.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:2:4">5:2:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. And whatever food he does trot bring to him, let him (the Sacrificer) forswear&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> that, and not eat of it as long as he lives: thus he does not go to the end, thus he lives long. Of all that food brought together he offers the (seven) V&acirc;<I>g</I>a-prasavan&icirc;ya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> oblations, cutting out (pieces) with the dipping-spoon.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:2:13">5:2:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. He sprinkles with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. IX, 30), 'At the impulse of the divine Savit<I>ri</I>, (I sprinkle) thee, by the arms of the A<I>s</I>vins, by the hands of P&ucirc;shan!' he thus sprinkles (consecrates) him by the hands of gods;--'I place thee in the leading of Sarasvat&icirc; V&acirc;<I>k</I>, the leader;' for Sarasvat&icirc; is V&acirc;<I>k</I> (speech): he thus places him in the leading of V&acirc;<I>k</I>, the leader.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:2:14">5:2:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. Here now some say, 'I place thee in the leading of the leader of all the gods;' for all the gods are the All: he thus places him in the leading of the leader of the All. But let him not say so; let him rather say, 'I place thee in the leading of Sarasvat&icirc; V&acirc;<I>k</I>;' for Sarasvat&icirc; is V&acirc;<I>k</I>: he thus places him in the leading of V&acirc;<I>k</I>.--'I consecrate thee, N.N., with the supreme rulership of B<I>ri</I>haspati!' therewith he mentions the (Sacrificer's) name: he thus makes him attain to the fellowship of B<I>ri</I>haspati, and to co-existence in his world.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:2:15">5:2:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. He then says,' All-ruler is he, N.N.! All-ruler is he, N.N.!' Him, thus indicated, he thereby indicates to the gods: 'Of mighty power is he who has been consecrated; he has become one of yours; protect him!' thus he thereby says. Thrice he says it, for threefold is the sacrifice.</p>

Whether he offers or makes him pronounce (the formulas), the significance is the same.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:2:17">5:2:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. He makes him say (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S.

There are seventeen (formulas), for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:2:18">5:2:2:18</A></FONT></span>18. Thereupon he says, 'Recite (the invitatory formula) to Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t!' Now, as to why this rite is performed between two oblations. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, truly, is that sacrifice which is here performed, and from which these creatures have been produced,--and, indeed, they are even now produced after this one: he thus wins Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati in the very middle: therefore that rite is performed between two oblations.

The I<I>d</I>&acirc; having been invoked&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he, having touched water, draws the M&acirc;hendra cup. Having drawn the M&acirc;hendra cup, he sets the chant agoing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. He urges him (the Sacrificer) forward to the chant: he gets down (from the throne-seat); he is in attendance at the Stotra, in attendance at the <I>S</I>astra.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:2:20">5:2:2:20</A></FONT></span>20. Here now some, having performed that, perform that&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; but let him not do it thus; for the Stotra is his (the Sacrificer's) own self, and the <I>S</I>astra is his people (or <A HREF="errata.htm#7">offspring</A>): thereby then he ruins the Sacrificer; he goes astray, he stumbles;--hence having performed that, let him perform that:--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:2:21">5:2:2:21</A></FONT></span>21. He puts the I<I>d</I>&acirc; on (the dish). The I<I>d</I>&acirc; having been invoked, he, having touched water, draws the M&acirc;hendra cup. Having drawn the M&acirc;hendra cup, he sets the (P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-) Stotra agoing. He urges him (the Sacrificer) forward to the chant: he gets down (from the throne-seat); he is in attendance at the chant (stotra), in attendance at the recitation (<I>s</I>astra).</p>
