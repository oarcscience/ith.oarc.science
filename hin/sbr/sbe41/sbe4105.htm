For the Ukthas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> he seizes one for Indra and Agni; for the hymns (uktha) relate to Indra and Agni&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: the hymns he thereby wins. For the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>i n he seizes one for Indra; for the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in is Indra: the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in (Indra) he thereby wins.</p>

For the seventeenth (or seventeenfold) stotra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> he seizes one for Sarasvat&icirc;: thereby, while there is no over-night performance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, it is yet made like the night (performance); for he who offers the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya</p>

<p>wins Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the year: by that (victim) for Sarasvat&icirc; he now wins the night: hence, while there is no night performance, it is made like the night.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:3:3">5:1:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. Thereupon he seizes a spotted sterile cow for the Victorious Maruts; for the spotted sterile cow is this (earth): whatever food, rooted and rootless, is here established on her, thereby she is a spotted cow. Now, he who offers the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya wins food, for v&acirc;<I>g</I>a-peya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> doubtless means the same as anna-peya (food and drink); and the Maruts are the peasants, and the peasants are food (for the noble). 'To the Victorious (Maruts)!' he says, even for the sake of victory. It is difficult to obtain an invitatory and offering prayer containing the word 'victorious:' if he should be unable to obtain such as contain the word 'victorious,' any other two verses to the Maruts will do. Difficult to obtain also is a spotted sterile cow: if he cannot obtain a spotted sterile cow, any other sterile cow will do.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:3:4">5:1:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. The course of procedure thereof (is as follows). When the Hot<I>ri</I> recites after the M&acirc;hendra libation, then let them proceed with (the offering of) her omentum, for that, the M&acirc;hendra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, is Indra's special (nishkevalya) libation; and his also are the Nishkevalya-stotra and Nishkevalya-<I>s</I>astra. Now the sacrificer is Indra: thus he thereby puts strength into the sacrificer in the very middle (of the sacrifice):</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_14"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 14</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that is why they should proceed with her omentum at that particular time.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:3:5">5:1:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. They cook the portions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in two lots. Of the one lot thereof, after making an 'under-layer' of ghee (clarified butter) in the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; spoon, he makes two cuttings from each (portion), bastes them once, and replenishes with ghee (the empty places of) the cuttings. Thereupon he makes one cutting from each into the upabh<I>ri</I>t spoon, bastes them twice, but does not replenish (the places of) the cuttings. Now, when of the one lot (of portions) he makes two cuttings from each, thereby that (sterile cow) becomes whole; and when he proceeds with those (portions), thereby he wins the divine race. He then presents the (other) half to the human kind: and thereby he wins the human kind (people, vi<I>s</I>).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:3:6">5:1:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. But let him not do it in this wise; for verily he who departs from the path of the sacrifice, stumbles; and he who does it in this wise certainly departs from the path of the sacrifice. Hence when they proceed with the omenta of the other victims, only then let them proceed with the omentum of that (cow). They cook the portions in one lot, and do not present any to the human kind.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:3:7">5:1:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. He then seizes seventeen victims for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. They are all hornless, all dark-grey&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, all (uncastrated) males; for he who offers the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya, wins Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati; but Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is food, and the victim (cattle) is food: he thus wins Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. And Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is Soma, and the victim is the visible</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_15"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 15</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Soma: he thus wins the visible Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. There are seventeen (victims), because Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:3:8">5:1:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. Now, they are all hornless;--for man is nearest to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and he is hornless, unhorned; and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati also is hornless, unhorned; and these (victims) belong to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati: therefore they are all hornless.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:3:9">5:1:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. They are all dark-grey. Now, the dark-grey has two forms, the light hair and the black; and a couple means a productive pair, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (the lord of generation) represents productiveness, and those (victims) belong to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati: therefore they are all dark-grey.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:3:10">5:1:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. They are all males;--for the male means productiveness, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati represents productiveness: hence they are all males. Difficult to obtain are victims with these perfections: if he cannot obtain them (all) with these perfections, even some with these perfections will do; for verily Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is everything here.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:3:11">5:1:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. Now, some seize the last (victim) for V&acirc;<I>k</I> (Speech), thinking, 'If there be anything beyond Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, that is Speech: we thus win Speech.' But let him not do it in this wise; for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is everything here,--these worlds and everything there is;--whatever speech speaks in these worlds, that speech he wins: therefore he need not heed this.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:3:12">5:1:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. The course of procedure regarding these (victims is as follows). When the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a recites after the V&acirc;madevya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, let them then proceed</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_16"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>with their omenta; for the V&acirc;madevya means productiveness, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati means productiveness, and these (victims) belong to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati: therefore let them proceed with their omenta at that time.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:3:13">5:1:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. And (when) the after-offerings have been performed, and the spoons have not yet been shifted (separated)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, then they proceed with the (chief) oblations of those (victims). That (point in the performance) is the end, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the end: thus he wins Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati at the very end. But were he to proceed therewith sooner, it would be just as if a man had already gone the way he still intends to go,--and where would he be after that&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>?--therefore</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_17"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>they proceed with their (chief) oblations at that time.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:1:3:14">5:1:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. But let him not do it in this wise for he who departs from the path of the sacrifice stumbles; and he who does it in this wise certainly departs from the path of the sacrifice. Hence whenever they proceed with the omenta of the other victims, let them at the same time proceed with the omenta of these; and whenever they proceed with the (chief) oblations of the other victims, let them at the same time proceed with the oblations of these. There is but one invitatory prayer, and one offering prayer; for (these offerings) belong to one deity. He says (to the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a), 'To Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati'--saying this (name) in a low voice--'recite the invitatory prayer for the offering of the bucks!'--'To Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati' saying this in a low voice--'urge the ready-standing offering of the bucks!' and as the Vasha<I>t</I> is uttered, he makes the offering.</p>

In the present paragraph, the author briefly reviews the lower forms of Soma-sacrifice, contained in the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya, <A NAME="page_12"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 12</FONT></A> with the view of enumerating the victims to be slaughtered at its performance; viz. the Agnish<I>t</I>oma with twelve chants and one victim; the Ukthya with fifteen stotras and two victims; and the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in with sixteen chants and three victims. For further particulars, see part ii, p. 397, note 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_46"></A><A HREF="sbe4105.htm#fr_46">12:1</A> The Agnish<I>t</I>oma-s&acirc;man, the last (twelfth) and distinctive stotra of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma sacrifice, is in praise of Agni (see part ii, p. 368, note 2). At the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya the ordinary (ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&#375;&acirc;) hymn is not chanted, but S.V. II, 973-4, sung to the V&acirc;ravant&icirc;ya tune (Calc. ed., vol. v, p. 144), takes its place. Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>. Br. 18, 6, 16.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_47"></A><A HREF="sbe4105.htm#fr_47">12:2</A> The three Uktha stotras (chants) and <I>s</I>astras (recitations) constitute the distinctive element of the Ukthya sacrifice; as the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>i-stotra and <I>s</I>astra (part ii, p. 401, note 3; p. 402, note i) constitute that of the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in sacrifice.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_48"></A><A HREF="sbe4105.htm#fr_48">12:3</A> On the important place assigned to these two deities in the traditional arrangement of the Rigveda-sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, see the introduction to part i, p. xvi.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_49"></A><A HREF="sbe4105.htm#fr_49">12:4</A> That is the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya-s&acirc;man, see note <A HREF="sbe4104.htm#fn_43">1</A>, <A HREF="sbe4104.htm#page_11">p. 11</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_50"></A><A HREF="sbe4105.htm#fr_50">12:5</A> The author here alludes to another form of Soma-sacrifice, not contained in the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya, viz. the Atir&acirc;tra, which is obtained by following up the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in (with its sixteen chants) with the so-called r&acirc;tri-pary&acirc;ya<I>h</I>, or night-rounds, consisting of three rounds of four chants each, or together twelve chants. These are succeeded, at day-break, by the Sandhi-stotra (or twilight chants), consisting of three chants. Although this night performance does not take place on the present occasion--the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya-s&acirc;man taking its place--the author claims for this form of sacrifice also the moral benefits which would accrue to the sacrificer from the Atir&acirc;tra, for the reason that the same victim (a be-goat for Sarasvat&icirc;) is offered on both occasions.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_51"></A><A HREF="sbe4105.htm#fr_51">13:1</A> In Taitt. Br. I, 3, 2, 3, on the other hand, v&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya (which doubtless means 'drink of strength') is explained first by v&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;pya, 'that through which the gods wished to obtain (aipsan) strength (v&acirc;<I>g</I>am),' and then by 'drink of strength,' i.e. Soma 'by drinking (p&icirc;tv&acirc;) which one becomes strong (v&acirc;<I>g</I>in).'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_55"></A><A HREF="sbe4105.htm#fr_55">15:1</A> The V&acirc;madevya-s&acirc;man (S&acirc;mav. II, 32-34) is the second P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra, after the chanting of which, at the midday feast, <A NAME="page_16"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 16</FONT></A> the first assistant of the Hot<I>ri</I>, the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a, has to recite his (the second) Nishkevalya-<I>s</I>astra; see part ii, p. 325, note 2; p. 339, note 2.--As regards the Hot<I>ri</I>'s P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra, the Rathantara-s&acirc;man (S. V. II, 30, 31) is used for it; while the Abh&icirc;varta tune (S. V. ed. Bibl. Ind. III, p. 93) is employed in the chanting of the Brahma-s&acirc;man (S. V. II, 35, 36; see part ii, p. 434, note I) instead of the ordinary Naudhasa tune. Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>. Br. 18, 6, 11-14.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_57"></A><A HREF="sbe4105.htm#fr_57">16:2</A> Or possibly, what would then become of him? The author's reasoning seems to be that, if the sacrificer were to offer any of the chief oblations at an earlier point in the performance, he would thereby anticipate the results he wants to obtain from the whole performance,--or, so to speak, he would then already reach the goal for the attainment of which the subsequent oblations are likewise intended. For the same reason the offering of the omentum of the sterile cow, previously to and independently of the omenta of the other victims, was discountenanced in paragraph <a href="sbe4105.htm#5:1:3:6">6</A>. Our present passage is interpreted rather differently by Professor Delbr&uuml;ck in his Altindische Syntax, p. 550:--Wenn er vorher damit vorginge, so w&auml;re das so, als ob er, nach Betretung des Pfades, den er zu betreten beabsichtigt, wo? ware (d. h. in&#8217;s Ungl&uuml;ck geriethe): 'Were he to proceed therewith sooner, it would be just as if, after entering on the path he intends to enter upon, he would be where? (i.e. would get into trouble).'</P>
