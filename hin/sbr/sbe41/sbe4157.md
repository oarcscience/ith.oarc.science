#### THE ALTAR OF NIR*RI*TI.

### SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:1">7:2:1:1</span></span>1. They
now take the Nir*ri*ti (bricks) from there. For, having built the
Gârhapatya, the gods then ascended it,--the Gârhapatya being this
(earth-) world, it is this world they ascended after completing it. They
saw nothing but darkness not to be seen through.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:2">7:2:1:2</span></span>2. They
said, 'Think ye upon this, how we may dispel that darkness, evil!' They
said, 'Meditate ye (*k*etay)!'--whereby indeed they said, 'Seek ye to
build an altar (kitim)!'--'Seek ye so that we may dispel that darkness,
evil!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:3">7:2:1:3</span></span>3. Whilst
meditating, they saw those Nir*ri*ti bricks; they piled them up, and by
them dispelled that darkness, evil; for Nir*ri*ti (corruption, or
destruction) is evil; and inasmuch as by them they dispelled Nir*ri*ti,
evil, these are Nir*ri*ti's (bricks).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:4">7:2:1:4</span></span>4. Now
that same thing which the gods did, is done here: even now that
darkness, that evil, has indeed been dispelled by the gods themselves;
but when he now does this, it is because he thinks, 'I must do what the
gods did.' And, besides, he removes, by means of these (bricks),
whatever evil, whatever corruption there is; and because he removes by
them evil, corruption (nir*ri*ti), therefore these are Nir*ri*ti's
(bricks).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:5">7:2:1:5</span></span>5. And,
again, why they take these (bricks) of Nir*ri*ti;--when the gods
restored the relaxed Pra*g*âpati, they cast him as seed into the
fire-pan, the

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

womb; the fire-pan being indeed a womb. In the course of a year they
prepared for him this foundation, even this (terrestrial) world; the
Gârhapatya (hearth) being this world: therein they generated him. And
whatever evil there was in him, whatever mucus, whatever inner and outer
membrane, that they removed from him by means of these (bricks); and
inasmuch as thereby they removed his evil, his corruption, these are
Nir*ri*ti's (bricks).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:6">7:2:1:6</span></span>6. In
like manner the Sacrificer now casts his own self <span
id="fr_610"></span>[1](#fn_608.md), as seed, into the fire-pan, the womb;
the fire-pan being indeed a womb. In the course of a year he prepares
for that (self of his) this foundation, even this (terrestrial) world;
the Gârhapatya being this world: therein he generates it. And whatever
evil there is of it, whatever mucus, whatever inner and outer membrane,
that he removes therefrom by these (bricks); and inasmuch as he thereby
removes its evil, its corruption, these are Nir*ri*ti's (bricks).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:7">7:2:1:7</span></span>7. They
measure a foot (square): he thus treads evil, corruption, under foot.
They are unmarked; for whatever is not, that is unmarked (by
characteristics): he thus makes evil, corruption to be non-existent.
They get baked by (rice) husks, for husks belong to Nir*ri*ti: by
Nir*ri*ti's own (objects) he thus performs Nir*ri*ti's rite. They are
black, for black was that darkness; and black in truth is Nir*ri*ti
(corruption).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:8">7:2:1:8</span></span>8. With
them they proceed towards that (southwestern) quarter, for that is
Nir*ri*ti's quarter: he thus places Nir*ri*ti (corruption) in
Nir*ri*ti's quarter.

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And anywhere where
there is a self-produced hollow <span id="fr_611"></span>[1](#fn_609.md) or
cleft in the ground, he lays down those (bricks); for on whatever part
of this (earth) there is a cleaving, or in whatever part of it plants
are not produced, verily that part of it Nir*ri*ti seizes upon: he thus
places corruption in a (part) of the earth set aside for Nir*ri*ti.
Having put them in their places in a direction away from himself <span
id="fr_612"></span>[2](#fn_610.md), he lays them down <span
id="fr_613"></span>[3](#fn_611.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:9">7:2:1:9</span></span>9. \[He
lays them down, with Vâ*g*. S. XII, 62-64\] 'Seek thou him that offereth
not Soma, nor other offering!' him who neither presses Soma nor makes
offering Nir*ri*ti indeed visits;--'Of the thief do thou follow the way,
of the robber!' that is, 'follow the way both of the thief and the
robber, and even as a thief or a robber remains concealed, so do thou
remain concealed!'--'Seek thou some one other than us: this is thy way;'
that is, 'seek him who is ignorant of this (sacred work);'--'Homage be
to thee, O divine Nir*ri*ti!' he thus turns Nir*ri*ti aside by rendering
homage to her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:10">7:2:1:10</span></span>10.
'Homage be unto thee full well, O sharp-edged Nir*ri*ti!' for Nir*ri*ti
is indeed sharp-edged: to her he thereby renders homage;--'loose thou

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

this iron bond!' for it is indeed with an iron bond that Nir*ri*ti binds
him whom she binds;--'being of one mind with Yama and Yamî,'--Yama
doubtless is Agni, and Yam is this (earth), and by these two everything
here is kept in check: thus, 'being of one mind with those two,'--'raise
him unto the highest firmament!' the firmament is the heavenly world:
thus, 'raise the Sacrificer up to the heavenly world!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:11">7:2:1:11</span></span>11.
'Thee, O awful (goddess), into whose mouth I offer--' Nir*ri*ti is
indeed awful, and into her mouth he now offers when he performs this
divine rite;--'for the unloosing of these bonds;' that is, of those
bonds with which he has been bound;--'Thee whom people rejoice in
calling Earth,'--the Earth is this (world), and he who exists, exists
thereon,--'but I know thee to be Nir*ri*ti everywhere!' that is, in
every respect I know that thou art Nir*ri*ti. Now Nir*ri*ti is this
earth, and this earth makes him decay who becomes corrupted: in speaking
thus, it is as if he were to say, 'Thou art So and So, the son of So and
So, I know thee, do not injure me!' for in no wise does he who is known
injure one when spoken to.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:12">7:2:1:12</span></span>12. He
does not touch (the bricks),--Nir*ri*ti being evil,--lest he put himself
in contact with evil. He does not 'settle' them,--settlement being a
firm footing--lest he give a firm footing to evil. He does not pronounce
the Sûdadohas verse upon them,--the Sûdadohas being the vital air,--lest
he should join Nir*ri*ti (corruption) together, and restore her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:13">7:2:1:13</span></span>13. Now
some lay (the bricks) down from the farther end towards
themselves,--Nir*ri*ti (corruption) being evil,--lest they themselves
should go the way

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

to corruption. Let him not do so, but let him lay them down in the
direction away from him: he thus drives evil, corruption, away from him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:14">7:2:1:14</span></span>14.
Three bricks he lays down,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as
great as is his measure, by so much he thus repels evil, corruption.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:15">7:2:1:15</span></span>15. The
seat, the netting, the sling of the gold plate, and the two pads he
throws down on the farther side (of the bricks),--the sling <span
id="fr_614"></span>[1](#fn_612.md) is sacred to Nir*ri*ti: from Nir*ri*ti's
sling he is thus freed. \[He throws them down, with Vâ*g*. S. XII, 65\]
'The indissoluble bond which the divine Nir*ri*ti hath fastened upon thy
neck,'--indissoluble indeed for him who does not know this;--'that
(bond) of thine I unloose, as from the middle of Âyus,'--Âyus <span
id="fr_615"></span>[2](#fn_613) doubtless is Agni, and his middle (body.md)
is that Gârhapatya which has been built;--not yet built is the
Âhavanîya: hence whether a youth builds the altar, or an old man, he
says 'as from the middle of Âyus;'--'now, being urged forward, eat thou
this nourishment!' nourishment means food: thus, 'now, set free, eat
thou this food.' With Trish*t*ubh verses (he performs this rite), for
the Trish*t*ubh is a thunderbolt: it is thus with a thunderbolt that he
repels evil, corruption.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:16">7:2:1:16</span></span>16.
There are three bricks, the seat, the netting, the sling of the gold
plate, and the two pads; that makes eight;--the Gâyatrî consists of
eight syllables,

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

and Agni is Gâyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by
so much he thus repels evil, corruption.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:17">7:2:1:17</span></span>17. On
the space between (the Sacrificer and the bricks) he pours out a jarful
of water,--water is a thunderbolt: with a thunderbolt he thus separates
from himself evil, corruption. With 'Homage to (the goddess of)
Prosperity who hath done this!' they rise, for it was with a view to
prosperity that the gods at first performed this rite, and to that
(goddess) they then rendered homage; and for prosperity indeed this
(Sacrificer) now performs this rite, and to that (goddess) he now
renders homage. They go back (to the sacrificial ground) without looking
back: they thus abandon evil, corruption, even without looking back to
it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:18">7:2:1:18</span></span>18.
Having returned, he stands worshipping by the fire; for when he goes
into that (south-western) direction whilst Agni is only half built up,
he does what is improper: he now makes amends to him to prevent his
doing any harm.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:19">7:2:1:19</span></span>19. And
again, why he stands by (the fire). The Gârhapatya (hearth) is this
(terrestrial) world; for the Gârhapatya is a foundation, and the
foundation doubtless is this (earth). Now when he goes into that
direction, he goes where there is no path; and when he stands by (the
fire), he thereby returns to this (earth), the foundation, and
establishes himself upon this foundation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:1:20">7:2:1:20</span></span>20.
\[He worships, with Vâ*g*. S. XII, 66\] 'The harbourer and gatherer of
riches,' for a harbourer this world indeed is, a gatherer of
riches;--'all form he watches over with his favours,'--that is, 'all
forms (of being) he watches over with

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

his favours;'--'like the god Savit*ri*, like Indra, he of true covenant
stood at the meeting of ways <span id="fr_616"></span>[1](#fn_614.md);' as
the text, so its meaning.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[320:1](sbe4157.htm#fr_610) Or (Pra*g*âpati's.md),
Agni's self, or body.

<span id="fn_609"></span>[321:1](sbe4157.htm#fr_611.md) Or probably, a
barren spot, see [p. 43](sbe4110.htm#page_43.md), note
[2](sbe4110.htm#fn_101.md).

<span id="fn_610"></span>[321:2](sbe4157.htm#fr_612.md) That is, whilst
himself remaining north of the place, and facing the south, he puts them
down in the direction from north to south.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[321:3](sbe4157.htm#fr_613.md) That is, he
performs the formal ceremony of 'laying down (upadhâna)' whilst
muttering the respective verses. In the present case the 'laying down'
of the bricks is to be performed by him whilst muttering the formulas,
but without touching the bricks themselves. The direction that the
bricks are to be deposited in a direction 'away from him' perhaps refers
to the 'laying down' instead of to the actual placing them.

<span id="fn_612"></span>[323:1](sbe4157.htm#fr_614.md) According to
Sâya*n*a the sling of the gold plate is here singled out, because the
other objects have necessarily been damaged by the hot fire-pan and are
consequently thrown away as a matter of course.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[323:2](sbe4157.htm#fr_615.md) See III, 4, 1, 22.
In the formula 'âyus' may rather have to be taken in the sense of
'life,' or 'vital power.' Mahîdhara takes 'na' in the sense of 'now
(samprati),' instead of 'as.'

<span id="fn_614"></span>[325:1](sbe4157.htm#fr_616.md) Mahîdhara takes
'samare pathînâm' in the sense of 'in the battle of (i.e. with) the
waylayers (paripanthibhi*h* saha).'
