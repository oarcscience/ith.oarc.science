### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:1">5:2:5:1</span></span>1. He
prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vish*n*u, a pap for
Indra and Vish*n*u, and either a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for
Vish*n*u. He performs that Trisha*m*yukta <span
id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_121.md) offering. Therewith the gods came by
men, and in like manner does this (king) now thereby come by men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:2">5:2:5:2</span></span>2. Now as
to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and
Vish*n*u;--Agni is the giver, and men are Vish*n*u's: thus Agni, the
giver, gives him (the king) men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:3">5:2:5:3</span></span>3. And as
to why there is a pap for Indra and Vish*n*u;--Indra is the Sacrificer,
and men are Vish*n*u's: thus Agni, the giver, gives him (the

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sacrificer) men;
he now puts himself in contact with them, makes them his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:4">5:2:5:4</span></span>4. And as
to why there is either a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for
Vish*n*u;--whatever men Agni, the giver, gives him, among them he
thereby finally establishes him (the king); and whatever work he wishes
to do with his men, that he is able to do. Thus he thereby approaches
the men, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, and possessed of men!' A
dwarfish bull is the sacrificial fee for this (offering), for the dwarf
belongs to Vish*n*u <span id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_122.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:5">5:2:5:5</span></span>5. He
then performs another Trisha*m*yukta offering. He prepares a cake on
eleven potsherds for Agni and Pûshan, a pap for Indra and Pûshan, and a
pap for Pûshan: this Trisha*m*yukta he offers. Thereby the gods obtained
cattle; and in like manner does this (king) thereby obtain cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:6">5:2:5:6</span></span>6. Now as
to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Pûshan; Agni
is the giver, and the cattle are Pûshan's: thus Agni, the giver, gives
him cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:7">5:2:5:7</span></span>7. And as
to why there is a pap for Indra and Pûshan;--Indra is the Sacrificer,
and the cattle are Pûshan's: whatever cattle Agni, the giver, gives him,
therewith he now puts himself in contact, those he makes his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:8">5:2:5:8</span></span>8. And
why there is a pap for Pûshan;--whatever cattle Agni, the giver, gives
him, therewith he thereby finally establishes him, and whatever work he
wishes to do with his cattle, that he is able

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

to do: thus he comes by cattle, thinking, 'May I be consecrated,
possessed of cattle!' A dark-grey <span id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md)
bull is the fee for this (offering), for such a dark-grey one is of
Pûshan's nature: there are two forms of the dark-grey, the white hair
and the black; and 'two and two' means a productive pair, and Pûshan
represents productiveness, for Pûshan is cattle, and cattle means
productiveness: thus a productive pair is obtained,--hence a dark-grey
bull is the sacrificial fee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:9">5:2:5:9</span></span>9. He
then performs another Trisha*m*yukta offering. He prepares a cake on
eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma, a pap for Indra and Soma, and a pap
for Soma: this Trisha*m*yukta (triply connected) he offers:--Thereby the
gods attained glory; and in like manner does this (king) thereby attain
glory.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:10">5:2:5:10</span></span>10. Now
as to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and
Soma;--Agni is the giver, and Soma is glory: thus Agni, the giver, gives
him glory.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:11">5:2:5:11</span></span>11. And
as to why there is a pap for Indra and Soma;--Indra is the Sacrificer,
and Soma is glory: whatever glory Agni, the giver, gives him, therewith
he now puts himself in contact, that he makes his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:12">5:2:5:12</span></span>12. And
why there is a pap for Soma;--whatever glory, Agni, the giver, gives
him, therein he now finally establishes him; and whatever work he, the
glorious, wishes to do, that he is able to do. Thus he thereby attains
glory,--thinking, 'May I be consecrated, endowed with glory!' for the
inglorious one has no concern with success. A brown bull is

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

the fee for this (offering); for such a brown one is of Soma's nature.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:13">5:2:5:13</span></span>13. And
on the following day he prepares a cake-on twelve potsherds for (Agni)
Vai*s*vânara, and a barley pap for Varu*n*a. These two offerings he
performs either on days following one another, or so as to use the same
barhis <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:14">5:2:5:14</span></span>14. And
as to why there is that (cake) for Vai*s*vânara;--Vai*s*vânara
('belonging to all men') truly is the year, and Pra*g*âpati is the year;
and Pra*g*âpati indeed thereby created abundance and creatures,
thinking, 'May I be consecrated, having created abundance and
creatures!' And in like manner does that (king) thereby create abundance
and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, having created abundance
and creatures!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:15">5:2:5:15</span></span>15. And
why it is one on twelve potsherds;--twelve months there are in the year,
and Vai*s*vânara is the year: this is why it is one on twelve potsherds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:16">5:2:5:16</span></span>16. And
as to why there is a barley pap for Varu*n*a; he thereby frees the
creatures from every snare of Varu*n*a, from all that comes from
Varu*n*a <span id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_125.md);

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

and those creatures of his are produced sound and faultless: 'May I be
consecrated for sound and faultless creatures (or subjects)!' he thinks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:5:17">5:2:5:17</span></span>17. A
bull is the fee for the Vai*s*vânara (oblation); for Vai*s*vânara is the
year, and Pra*g*âpati is the year; and the bull is the Pra*g*âpati (lord
of creatures or generation) among cows: therefore a bull is the fee for
the Vai*s*vânara. A black cloth for the Vâru*n*a (oblation), for what is
black belongs to Varu*n*a. If he cannot obtain a black one, any kind of
cloth will do: it is by its knots that the cloth belongs to Vanilla, for
the knot is sacred to Varu*n*a.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_121"></span>[54:1](sbe4112.htm#fr_121.md) That is, 'the triply
connected,' the ceremony being made up of three rounds, each of which
consists of three separate oblations,

1\. Agnâvaish*n*ava cake, Aindrâvaish*n*ava pap, Vaish*n*ava pap;  
2. Agnâpaush*n*a cake, Aindrâpaush*n*a pap, Paush*n*a pap;  
3. Agnîshomîya cake, Aindrâsaumya pap, Samnya pap.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In this way one of
the three divinities for whom the offering is intended,--viz. Vish*n*u,
Pûshan, and Soma,--is each time connected with the two head-gods, Agni
and Indra.--In the Black Ya*g*ur-veda, this set of offerings (not,
however, called there by this name), is preceded by another ceremony
consisting of five oblations to Dhât*ri*, Anumati, Râkâ, Sinîvâlî, and
Kuhû. Taitt. S. I, 8, 8. Cf. *S*ât. Br. IX, 5, 1, 38.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[55:1](sbe4112.htm#fr_122.md) See the legend, I,
2, 3, 1 seq., which represents Vish*n*u as a dwarf, who obtained from
the Asuras as much ground for the gods, as he lay upon.--'Tad dhi
pa*s*ushu vaish*n*ava*m* rûpa*m* yad vâmanasya go*h*.' Kâ*n*va rec.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[56:1](sbe4112.htm#fr_123.md) See V, 1, 3, 9.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[57:1](sbe4112.htm#fr_124.md) That is to say, he
is either to perform the Vai*s*vânara on one, and the Vâru*n*a one on
the next--in which case a different barhis, or altar-covering of
sacrificial grass, would be needed--or he may perform them both on one
and the same day, with the same barhis serving for both.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[57:2](sbe4112.htm#fr_125.md) See III, 8; 5, 10
where I translated, 'from all (guilt) against Varu*n*a;' varu*n*ya,
doubtless, implies both the guilt incurred by the infringement of
Varu*n*a's sacred laws, and the punishment inflicted by him. As regards
the 'swearing by Varu*n*a (?)' there referred to, see *Ri*k S. X, 97, 16
where the conjurer mutters: 'May they (the plants) free me from the
(evil) resulting from the curse and from Varu*n*a;'--mu*ñ*kantu mâ
*s*apathyâd atho varu*n*yâd uta.
