#### THE SÂVITRA LIBATIONS.

### THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:1">6:3:1:1</span></span>1. The
gods then said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby doubtless they meant to say,
'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst they were meditating, Savit*ri* saw those
Sâvitra (formulas); and inasmuch as Savit*ri* saw them, they are called
Sâvitra. He offered that eightfold-taken libation; and when he had
offered it, he saw this eightfold-appointed Ashâ*dh*â <span
id="fr_394"></span>[1](#fn_394.md), which had been created aforetime.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:2">6:3:1:2</span></span>2. Now
when they said, 'Meditate ye!' they doubtless meant to say, 'Seek ye a
layer!' and inasmuch as they saw it whilst meditating (*k*etay),
therefore it is a layer (*k*iti). And the libation is a sacrifice; and
inasmuch as he saw it after sacrificing (ish*t*vâ), it is a brick
(ish*t*akâ).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:3">6:3:1:3</span></span>3. Now
that same (libation of ghee), while being a single one, he offers as an
eightfold one <span id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_395.md) with eight formulas:
whence this ('invincible' brick), while being a single one, is eightfold
appointed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:4">6:3:1:4</span></span>4. He
offers while raising upwards (the spoon);--he thereby raises this earth
upwards by means of its forms <span id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_396.md):
whence this earth is raised (above the water) by its forms.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:5">6:3:1:5</span></span>5. He
offers it continuously;--for at that time the gods were afraid lest the
Rakshas, the fiends, should come thither after them! They saw that
continuous libation for preventing the Rakshas, the fiends, from coming
after them: hence he offers it continuously.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:6">6:3:1:6</span></span>6. And,
again, why he offers that libation;--this Agni is Savit*ri*, and him he
gratifies at the outset by this libation; and having sacrificed to, and
gratified, him (Agni), he then puts him together. And inasmuch as by
this (libation) he gratifies Savit*ri*, they (the formulas are called)
Sâvitra: that is why he offers this libation.

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:7">6:3:1:7</span></span>7. And,
again, why he offers this libation;--this Agni is Savit*ri*, and him he
pours out as seed at the outset by this libation; and whatlike seed is
poured into the womb suchlike (offspring) is born. And inasmuch as by
this (libation) he pours out Savit*ri* as seed, they (the
offering-formulas are called) Sâvitra: that is why he offers this
libation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:8">6:3:1:8</span></span>8. Both
an offering-spoon (sru*k*) and a dipping-spoon (sruva) are used thereat;
for the offering-spoon is speech, and the dipping-spoon is breath; and
with speech and breath the gods sought this sacred rite at the
beginning: hence there are an offering-spoon and a dipping-spoon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:9">6:3:1:9</span></span>9. And,
again, why there are an offering-spoon and a dipping-spoon,--what
Pra*g*âpati was, that indeed is this dipping-spoon, for the
dipping-spoon is the breath, and the breath is Pra*g*âpati. And what
Vâ*k* (speech) was, that is this offering-spoon; for Vâ*k* is a female,
and the offering-spoon (sru*k*, f.) is a female; and those waters which
went forth from the world of Vâ*k* (speech) <span
id="fr_397"></span>[1](#fn_397), they are this (ghee.md) which he offers
(in) this libation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:10">6:3:1:10</span></span>10. He
offers it continuously, for those waters flowed continuously. And
inasmuch as that Pra*g*âpati entered the waters with the threefold
science <span id="fr_398"></span>[2](#fn_398.md), that is these prayers
(ya*g*us) with which this (priest) now offers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:11">6:3:1:11</span></span>11. The
first three which there are, are these (three) worlds; and what fourth
prayer there is that

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

is the threefold science, that is the *G*agatî,--the *G*agatî being all
the metres, and all the metres (making up) the threefold science; and
what last four (prayers) there are, they are the quarters: now
Pra*g*âpati indeed is those worlds and the quarters; and that (*g*agatî
verse in the middle) is the threefold science.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:12">6:3:1:12</span></span>12. He
offers with (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 1), 'Harnessing first the
mind,'--Pra*g*âpati, assuredly, is he that harnesses, he harnessed the
mind for that holy work; and because he harnessed the mind for that holy
work, therefore he is the harnessing one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:13">6:3:1:13</span></span>13.
'Savit*ri*, stretching out the thoughts,'--for Savit*ri* is the mind,
and the thoughts are the vital airs;--'gazing reverently at Agni's
light,'--that is, having seen Agni's light;--'bore up from the earth;'
for upwards from the earth he indeed bears this (offering).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:14">6:3:1:14</span></span>14.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 2\] 'With harnessed mind we,'--he thereby harnesses the
mind for this work, for with unharnessed mind one cannot now do
anything;--'at the impulse of the god Savit*ri*,'--that is impelled
(sped) by the god Savit*ri*,--'with power (we strive) for the
heavenly;'--'that by this holy work he may go to the heavenly world,' he
thereby means to say; 'with power,' he says, for by power (energy) one
goes to the heavenly world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:15">6:3:1:15</span></span>15.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 3\] 'Savit*ri*, having harnessed the gods,'--Savit*ri*
is the mind, and the gods are the vital airs;--'going by thought to the
light, to heaven,'--for as such as are going to the heavenly world by
thought (devotion) he has harnessed them for this holy work;--'going to
produce a mighty light,'--the mighty light assuredly is yonder sun, and

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

he is this Agni, and him they are indeed going to fit together (or,
restore);--'may Savit*ri* speed them!'--that is, 'may they perform this
holy work, sped by Savit*ri*.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:16">6:3:1:16</span></span>16.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 4\] 'They harness the mind, and they harness the
thoughts,'--for both the mind and the vital airs he harnesses for this
holy work;--'the priests of the priest,'--the priest is Pra*g*âpati, and
the priests are the gods;--'of the great inspirer of devotion,'--the
great inspirer of devotion <span id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_399.md) is
Pra*g*âpati;--'he hath assigned the priestly offices,'--now when he
(Agni-Pra*g*âpati) is built up, then he assigns the priestly offices,
for the priestly offices are assigned over the built-up
(fire-altar);--'the finder of rites,'--for he indeed found this
rite;--'he alone,' for he alone found this whole holy rite;--'mighty is
the praise of the god Savit*ri*,'--that is, 'great is the praise of the
god Savit*ri*.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:17">6:3:1:17</span></span>17.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 5 *Ri*k S. X, 13, 1\] 'By devotions I harness your old
inspiration,'--the old inspiration (brahman) doubtless is the vital air,
and devotion is food, and that food is this oblation: by means of this
oblation, by means of this food, he harnesses the vital airs for this
holy work,--'May the praise spread abroad on the lord's path,'--this he
says in order that there may be for the Sacrificer the praise of fame
among both gods and men;--'may all sons of the immortal hear!'--the
immortal one doubtless is Pra*g*âpati, and his sons are all the
gods;--'who have resorted

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

to the heavenly abodes;'--the heavenly abodes are these worlds: the gods
that are in these worlds, with regard to them he says this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:18">6:3:1:18</span></span>18.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 6; *Ri*k S. V, 81, 3\] 'Whose course the others have
followed,'--for Pra*g*âpati first performed this rite, whereupon the
gods performed it;--'the gods with vigour, the god's greatness,'--the
greatness is the sacrifice, thus: 'the gods with vigour (followed) the
god's sacrifice, his energy;'--'that dappled steed who hath measured the
terrestrial (regions),'--whatsoever is on this earth that is
terrestrial, all that he measures out; for with his rays he reaches down
to it;--'the regions, he the god Savit*ri* by his greatness,'--the
regions are these worlds, and the god Savit*ri* is yonder sun: he
measures them by his greatness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:19">6:3:1:19</span></span>19.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 7\] 'God Savit*ri*, speed the sacrifice, speed the lord
of sacrifice unto his share!'--the god Savit*ri* is yonder sun, and his
share is the sacrifice, that he means to say when he says 'speed the
sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice!'--'May the heavenly,
thought-cleansing Gandharva cleanse our thought!'--the heavenly
Gandharva is yonder sun, and thought is (sacrificial) food; thus, 'May
the food-cleanser cleanse our food!'--'May the lord of speech render
agreeable our speech!'--this sacred rite is speech, and the lord of
speech is the breath: thus, 'May the breath render agreeable this rite
of ours!!

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:20">6:3:1:20</span></span>20.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 8\] 'Further, O god Savit*ri*, this our sacrifice!'--the
god Savit*ri* is yonder sun, and whatever sacrificial rite he furthers,
that

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

reaches its end safely and auspiciously;--'as one pleasant to the
gods,'--that is, as one which shall please the gods;--'friend-gaining,
ever-winning, wealth-winning, heaven-winning,'--that is, one that may
gain all this;--'Make the hymn-tune successful with the *rik* (verse),
the Rathantara with the Gâyatra (metre), and the B*ri*hat, moving in
Gâyatra measures!'--thus the sâmans (hymns);--'Hail!' thus the
sacrificial formulas: this threefold science is first produced, even as
it was there and then produced. And the Agni who was produced, he is
this Agni (fire-altar) who is built up from hence upwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:21">6:3:1:21</span></span>21.
These then are the eight Sâvitra (formulas <span
id="fr_400"></span>[1](#fn_400).md);--the Gâyatrî has eight syllables, and
Agni is Gâyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by
just so much he pours him out as seed. There are nine of them, the call
of 'Hail' (being) the ninth,--there are nine regions, and Agni is the
regions; nine vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni
is, as great as is. his measure, by so much he pours him out as seed.
There are ten of them, the libation (being) the tenth,--the Virâ*g* has
ten syllables, and Agni is Virâ*g* (the widely shining <span
id="fr_401"></span>[2](#fn_401).md); there are ten regions, and Agni is the
regions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni
is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:22">6:3:1:22</span></span>22.
This libation having been offered, Agni went away from the gods. The
gods said, 'Agni is the

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

cattle (or, an animal), let us search for him by means of the (different
kinds of) cattle: he will become manifest unto his own form.' They
searched for him by means of the cattle, and he became manifest to his
own form: and hence even to this day the animal becomes manifest to its
own form (kind) <span id="fr_402"></span>[1](#fn_402.md), cow to cow, horse
to horse, and man to man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:23">6:3:1:23</span></span>23.
They said, 'Surely, if we search with all of them, they will become used
up and affording no livelihood; and if not with all, we shall get him
(Agni) incomplete.' They saw one animal (as a substitute) for two
animals <span id="fr_403"></span>[2](#fn_403.md), namely, the ass (as a
substitute) for the cow and the sheep; and because they saw that one
beast (would do) for two beasts, therefore that one (the he-ass), whilst
being one, doubly impregnates <span id="fr_404"></span>[3](#fn_404.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:24">6:3:1:24</span></span>24. The
sham-man <span id="fr_405"></span>[4](#fn_405.md) (they saw to be a
substitute) for man,--a sham-man doubtless is he who pleases neither the
gods, nor the fathers, nor men. Thus they searched by means of all the
beasts, and yet they (the beasts) did not come to be used up and
affording no livelihood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:25">6:3:1:25</span></span>25.
With three he searches,--Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is, as
great as is his measure, with so much he thus searches for him. They are
five

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

by way of (mystic) correspondence <span
id="fr_406"></span>[1](#fn_406),--Agni (the fire-altar.md) has five layers;
five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as
great as is his measure, so great does this become.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:26">6:3:1:26</span></span>26.
They are fastened with halters of reed-grass to guard (Agni) against
injury <span id="fr_407"></span>[2](#fn_407.md);--Agni went away from the
gods; he entered into a reed, whence it is hollow, and whence inside it
is, as it were, smoke-tinged: (thus) that, the reed, is Agni's womb, and
Agni is these cattle; and the womb does not injure the child. For <span
id="fr_408"></span>[3](#fn_408.md) it is from a womb that he who is born is
born: 'from the womb he (Agni) shall be born when he is born,' thus he
thinks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:27">6:3:1:27</span></span>27.
They (the halters) are triple (strings), for Agni is threefold. They are
made like a horse's halter, for the horse's halter lies all round the
mouth, and the womb lies all round the child: thus it is made like the
womb.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:28">6:3:1:28</span></span>28.
They (the animals) stand facing the east, first the horse, then the ass,
then the he-goat; for this

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

is their proper order. For that horse (a*s*va) is the tear (a*s*ru)
which there (at the creation) formed itself; and that ass (râsabha) is
that which, as it were, cried (ras); and that he-goat (a*g*a, unborn) is
the juice which adhered to the shell; and that clay which they are about
to fetch is nothing else than the shell (of the egg): for it was from
these forms that he was created at first <span
id="fr_409"></span>[1](#fn_409.md), and from them he thus produces him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:29">6:3:1:29</span></span>29.
They stand on the south side;--for the gods at that time were afraid,
lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should smite their sacrifice from the
south. They saw that thunderbolt, yonder sun; for this horse is indeed
yonder sun; and by means of that thunderbolt they drove off the Rakshas,
the fiends, from the south, and spread this sacrifice in a place free
from danger and devilry. And in like manner does the Sacrificer now by
this thunderbolt drive off the Rakshas, the fiends, from the south, and
spread this sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:30">6:3:1:30</span></span>30. On
the right (south) side is the Âhavanîya fire, and on the left (north)
lies that spade; for the Âhavanîya (m.) is a male, and the spade (abhri,
f.) a female, and the male lies on the right side of the female <span
id="fr_410"></span>[2](#fn_410.md). \[It lies\] at a cubit's distance, for
at a cubit's distance the male lies by the female.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:31">6:3:1:31</span></span>31. It
should be made of bamboo. Agni went away from the gods. He entered into
a bamboo-stem; whence that is hollow. On both sides he made himself
those fences, the knots, so as not

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

to be found out; and wherever he burnt through, those spots came to be.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:32">6:3:1:32</span></span>32. It
(the spade) should be spotted, for such a one is of Agni's nature. If he
cannot procure a spotted one, it may be unspotted, but hollow it must
be, to guard (Agni) from injury <span
id="fr_411"></span>[1](#fn_411);--(for.md) such a one alone is of Agni's
nature; that, the bamboo, is Agni's womb; and this (lump of) clay is
Agni; and the womb does not injure the child. For it is from a womb that
he who is born is born: 'from the womb he (Agni) shall be born when he
is born,' so he thinks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:33">6:3:1:33</span></span>33. It
may be a span long, for the voice here speaks but as far as a span's
distance <span id="fr_412"></span>[2](#fn_412.md). It is, however, a cubit
long, for the cubit is the arm, and strength is exerted by the arm: it
thus becomes equal to his strength.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:34">6:3:1:34</span></span>34. It
may be sharp on one side only, for on one of the two sides is there a
keen edge to this speech of ours <span id="fr_413"></span>[3](#fn_413.md).
But indeed it is one that is sharp on both sides, for on both sides is
there a keen edge to this speech of curs, inasmuch as it speaks both
what is divine and what is human <span id="fr_414"></span>[4](#fn_414.md),
and both truth and untruth: therefore it is one that is sharp on both
sides.

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:35">6:3:1:35</span></span>35.
And, again, why it is sharp on both sides,--the strength of the spade
doubtless is on that side on which there is its sharp edge: he thus lays
strength into it on both sides.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:36">6:3:1:36</span></span>36.
And, again, why it is sharp on both sides,--when the gods had there
discovered him (Agni), they dug him out from these worlds; and in like
manner does he now, after discovering him, dig him out from these
worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:37">6:3:1:37</span></span>37.
When it digs thus (downwards), then it digs him out from this world; and
when it moves upwards, then from yonder world; and when it moves about
between the two, then from the air-world: it thus digs him out from all
these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:38">6:3:1:38</span></span>38. He
takes it up, with (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 9), 'At the impulse of the god
Savit*ri*, I take thee by the arms of the A*s*vins, by the hands of
Pûshan, by the Gâyatrî metre, Aṅgiras-like!' By means of those deities
he thus takes it up, impelled by Savit*ri*; by the Gâyatrî metre: he
thus imparts the Gâyatrî metre to it. 'From the Earth's seat,
Aṅgiras-like, bring thou Agni Purîshya <span
id="fr_415"></span>[1](#fn_415.md)!'--

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

now soil means cattle: thus, 'from the earth's lap bring thou Agni,
favourable to cattle, as Agni (did)!'--'by the Trish*t*ubh metre,
Aṅgiras-like!' he thereby takes it with the Trish*t*ubh metre and thus
lays into it the Trish*t*ubh metre.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:39">6:3:1:39</span></span>39.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 10\] 'A spade thou art,'--for a spade it is: he thus
takes it by means of the truth;--'A woman thou art!'--the spade is a
thunderbolt, and the woman is a female, and a female injures no one: he
thus appeases it so as not to do any injury. 'By thee may we be able to
dig out Agni in the seat!' the seat no doubt is this (spot): thus, 'By
thee may we be able to dig out Agni in this seat (place).'--'By the
*G*agatî metre, Aṅgiras-like!' he thus takes it up by means of the
*G*agatî metre, and lays the *G*agatî metre into it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:40">6:3:1:40</span></span>40.
With three (formulas) he takes it up,--threefold is Agni: as great as
Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus takes it. Having
taken it up with three (formulas), he addresses it with a fourth; for
the gods having thus taken it with three (formulas), then laid vigour
into it by means of a fourth; and in like manner does he now, after
taking it up with three (formulas), lay strength into it with the
fourth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:41">6:3:1:41</span></span>41.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 11\] 'Having taken into his hand, Savit*ri*,'--for it
has indeed been taken into his (the Adhvaryu's) hand,--'bearing the
spade,'--for he indeed bears it,--'the golden,'--for golden indeed is
the one that consists of the metres (the Veda);--'beholding Agni's
light,'--that is, seeing Agni's light,--'lifted it up from the
earth,'--for he indeed lifts it up from the earth;--'by the Anush*t*ubh
metre, Aṅgiras-like;'--he thus takes

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

it up by means of the Anush*t*ubh metre, and lays the Anush*t*ubh metre
into it: for his undertaking that spade of bamboo is thus made to be
those metres.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:42">6:3:1:42</span></span>42.
Some, indeed, make it of gold, saying, 'It is spoken of as golden.' Let
him not do so: in that it is the metres, thereby that (spade) is gold,
immortal gold, the immortal metres.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:43">6:3:1:43</span></span>43. He
takes it up with four (formulas), for all speech consists of four
syllables: 'vâk' (speech) is one syllable, and 'aksharam' (syllable)
consists of three syllables. Now that monosyllable 'vâk' is the same as
this last one, the Anush*t*ubh; and that trisyllable 'aksharam' is the
same as those former formulas: he thus digs up Agni by the whole speech,
and equips it with the whole speech,--hence with four (formulas).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:1:44">6:3:1:44</span></span>44.
And, again, why with four (formulas);--there are four quarters: he thus
lays speech into the four quarters, whence speech speaks in the four
quarters. He takes it up both by metres and by formulas, that makes
eight--there are four quarters, and four intermediate quarters: he thus
lays speech into all the quarters, whence speech speaks in all the
quarters.

1, 1, 13](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:13.md) seq., the earth is rather said to
consist of nine different elements, the 'invincible' brick is commonly
identified with the earth. See [VI, 5, 3, 1](sbe4143.htm#6:5:3:1.md). For
the (eightfold) compositions of the clay used for the fire-pan and
bricks, see [VI, 5, 1, 1](sbe4141.htm#6:5:1:1.md) seq.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[191:1](sbe4134.htm#fr_395.md) That is to say, the
offering-spoon is filled by eight dippings with the dipping-spoon.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[191:2](sbe4134.htm#fr_396.md) That is, by means
of its constituent elements;--p*ri*thivîm ûrdhvâ*m* rûpair m*ri*dâdibhir
udgamayati, Sây.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[192:1](sbe4134.htm#fr_397.md) See [VI, 1, 1,
9](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:9.md).

<span id="fn_398"></span>[192:2](sbe4134.htm#fr_398.md) [VI, 1, 1,
10](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:10.md).--The construction of the text is somewhat
peculiar,--what the author means to say seems to be,--the threefold
science (the Veda) with which Pra*g*âpati entered the waters is the same
as the prayers now offered up.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[194:1](sbe4134.htm#fr_399.md) See III, 5, 3, 12,
where 'b*ri*hat vipa*sk*it' (in the same formula) is explained as
referring to the sacrifice.

<span id="fn_400"></span>[196:1](sbe4134.htm#fr_400.md) Or, the single
oblations, as distinguished from the whole continued libation.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[196:2](sbe4134.htm#fr_401.md) Dîptyâ
virâ*g*amâna*h*, Sây.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[197:1](sbe4134.htm#fr_402.md) That is to say, it
shows itself openly, appears fearlessly before others of its
kind;--Svâya rûpâyeti tâdarthye *k*aturthî; âvi*h* prakâ*s*o bhavati,
tadanukâre*n*edânîm api pa*s*u*h* svâya rûpâya samâna*g*âtîyâyâ
prakâ*s*o bhavati, Sây.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[197:2](sbe4134.htm#fr_403.md) That is to say,
they saw that one animal might do for two,--pa*ñk*amî pratinidhau, Sây.
(Pâ*n*. II, 3, 11.)

<span id="fn_404"></span>[197:3](sbe4134.htm#fr_404.md) Viz. the she-ass
and the mare.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[197:4](sbe4134.htm#fr_405.md) Anaddhâ-purusham
alîka-purusham purushât pratyapa*s*yan purushasthâne kalitavantas, Sây.
Thus probably a counterfeit of a man, a doll or human effigy.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[198:1](sbe4134.htm#fr_406.md) That is, in order
that this item of the sacrificial performance should correspond with the
nature of Agni. The number of five is obtained by the three beasts
actually led forward,--a horse, an ass, and a he-goat--and the two
beasts for which the ass was stated to be a substitute, viz. the cow (or
bullock) and the sheep.--Sâya*n*a, whose comment is very corrupt in this
place, remarks,--nânaddhâpurusho<sup>ऽ</sup>tra ga*n*yate.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[198:2](sbe4134.htm#fr_407.md) In the text the
dative of purpose ('ahi*m*sâyai') is as usual shifted right to the end
of the train of reasoning explaining the *raison d’être* of this item of
the performance.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[198:3](sbe4134.htm#fr_408.md) This final clause
with 'vai' supplies the reason why Agni entered the womb, viz. because
otherwise he could not be born;--just as the preceding clause with 'vai'
(the womb does not injure the child) supplies the reason why reed grass
is used; whilst the preceding clauses explain how the reed comes to be
the womb whence Agni sprung.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[199:1](sbe4134.htm#fr_409.md) See [VI, 1, 1,
11](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:11.md).

<span id="fn_410"></span>[199:2](sbe4134.htm#fr_410.md) Dakshi*n*ato vai

<span id="fn_411"></span>[200:1](sbe4134.htm#fr_411.md) For the
construction, see [p. 198](#page_198), note [2](#fn_407.md).

<span id="fn_413"></span>[200:3](sbe4134.htm#fr_413.md) According to
Sâya*n*a the tip of the tongue is indicated (as [VII, 2, 3,
3](sbe4159.htm#7:2:3:3); [2, 4, 14](sbe4160.htm#7:2:4:14.md), 'vâ*k*' means
'mouth'); but perhaps it is rather sharp, vituperative speech addressed
to another person that is intended here.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[200:4](sbe4134.htm#fr_414.md) Sâya*n*a identifies
the divine speech with Sa*m*sk*ri*t, and the human speech with the
Apabhra*ms*as, or low dialects (? mânusha*m* *k*âpâtro*s*am, MS.).

<span id="fn_415"></span>[201:1](sbe4134.htm#fr_415.md) Mahîdhara says,
Agni is called 'purîshya,' because loose soil (purîsha) is put in the
fire-pan (ukhâ), on which the fire is then placed. It also doubtless
refers to the loose soil which is spread over the different layers of
the altar, thus serving as mortar to the bricks. In this epithet of
Agni, 'purîsha' seems, however, to be taken in yet another, more subtle
sense, the author apparently connecting with it its etymological meaning
of 'that which fills, fillings, Germ. Füllung, Füllsel;' whilst the
reference to cattle might also seem to point to the later ordinary
meaning, 'faeces, manure.' Mahîdhara, on the force of the symbolical
identification 'pa*s*avo vai purîsham,' seems straightway to take
'purîsha' as a synonym of 'pa*s*u,' when he says,--purîshebhya*h*
pa*s*ubhyo hita*h* purîshya*h*. Sâya*n*a's comment here is
corrupt,--pa*s*avo vai purîsha*m* pûra*n*âmûhi(?) kârya*m* pa*s*ava*h*
pûrayanti.
