### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:1">5:5:5:1</span></span>1. He
prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Vish*n*u. Now as to
why he makes this offering. Of old, everything here was within V*ri*tra,
to wit, the *Rik*, the Ya*g*us, and the Sâman. Indra wished to hurl the
thunderbolt at him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:2">5:5:5:2</span></span>2. He
said to Vish*n*u, 'I will hurl the thunderbolt at V*ri*tra, stand thou
by me!'--'So be it!' said Vish*n*u, 'I will stand by thee: hurl it!'
Indra aimed the thunderbolt at him. V*ri*tra was afraid of the raised
thunderbolt.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:3">5:5:5:3</span></span>3. He
said, 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to
thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Ya*g*us-formulas. He
(Indra) aimed at him a second time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:4">5:5:5:4</span></span>4. He
said, 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to
thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Rik-verses. He aimed
at him a third time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:5">5:5:5:5</span></span>5. 'There
is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to thee; but do not
smite me!' and gave up to him the Sâman-hymns (or tunes). Therefore they
spread the sacrifice even to this day in the same way with those (three)
Vedas, first with the

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ya*g*us-formulas,
then with the *Ri*k-verses, and then with the Sâman-hymns; for thus he
(V*ri*tra) at that time gave them up to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:6">5:5:5:6</span></span>6. And
that which had been his (V*ri*tra's) seat, his retreat, that he
shattered, grasping it and tearing it out <span
id="fr_273"></span>[1](#fn_273.md): it became this offering. And because
the science (the Veda) that lay in that retreat was, as it were, a
threefold (tridhâtu) one, therefore this is called the Traidhâtavî
(ish*t*i).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:7">5:5:5:7</span></span>7. And as
to why the oblation is one for Indra and Vish*n*u, it is because Indra
raised the thunderbolt, and Vish*n*u stood by him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:8">5:5:5:8</span></span>8. And
why it is (a cake) on twelve potsherds,--there are twelve months in the
year, and the offering is of equal measure with the year: therefore it
is one of twelve potsherds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:9">5:5:5:9</span></span>9. He
prepares it of both rice and barley. He first puts on (the fire) a ball
of rice, that being a form (symbol) of the Ya*g*us-formulas; then one of
barley, that being a form of the *Ri*k-verses; then one of rice, that
being a form of the Sâman-hymns. Thus this is made to be a form of the
triple science: and this same (offering) becomes the Udavasânîyâ-ish*t*i
(completing oblation) for the performer of the Râ*g*asûya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:10">5:5:5:10</span></span>10.
For, verily, he who performs the Râ*g*asûya gains for himself (the
benefit of) all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the
spoonful-oblations; for him the sacrifice becomes as it were exhausted,
and he, as it were, turns away from it. Now the whole sacrifice is just
as great as that triple Veda; and this (offering) now is made a form of
that (Veda, or

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

sacrifice); this is its womb, its seat: thus he commences once more the
sacrifice by means of that triple Veda; and thus his sacrifice is not
exhausted, and he does not turn away from it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:11">5:5:5:11</span></span>11.
And, verily, he who performs the Râ*g*asûya gains for himself all
sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; and this
offering, the Traidhâtavî (ish*t*i), is instituted by the gods: 'May
this offering also be performed by me, may I be consecrated by this one
also!' thus he thinks, and therefore this is the completing offering for
him who performs the Râ*g*asûya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:12">5:5:5:12</span></span>12. And
also for him who would give (to the priests) a thousand (cows) or
more <span id="fr_274"></span>[1](#fn_274.md), let this be the completing
offering. For he who gives a thousand or more becomes as it were emptied
out; and that triple Veda is the thousandfold progeny of Vâ*k* (speech):
him who was emptied out he thus fills up again with a thousand; and
therefore let it be for him also the completing offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:13">5:5:5:13</span></span>13. And
also for those who would sit through (perform) a long sacrificial
session <span id="fr_275"></span>[2](#fn_275.md), for a year or more, let
this be the completing offering. For by those who sit through a long
sacrificial session, for a year or more, everything is obtained,
everything conquered; but this (offering) is everything: let it
therefore be for them also the completing offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:14">5:5:5:14</span></span>14. And
indeed one may also practise magic by this (offering); for it was
thereby that Âra*n*i bewitched

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bhadrasena
Â*g*âta*s*atrava <span id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_276.md): 'Quick, then,
spread (the barhis)!' thus Yâ*gñ*avalkya used to say. And by this
(offering) indeed Indra also shattered V*ri*tra's retreat; and, verily,
he who therewith practises magic shatters thereby the retreat (of his
enemy): therefore one may also practise magic with this (offering).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:15">5:5:5:15</span></span>15.
And, indeed, one may also heal thereby; for, verily, whomsoever one
would heal by a single *rik*, by a single ya*g*us, by a single sâman,
him he would indeed render free from disease; how much more so by the
triple Veda! Therefore one may also heal by this (offering).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:16">5:5:5:16</span></span>16.
Three gold pieces of a hundred mânas <span
id="fr_277"></span>[2](#fn_277.md) each are the sacrificial fee for this
(offering). He presents them to the Brahman; for the Brahman neither
performs (like the Adhvaryu), nor chants (like the Udgât*ri*), nor
recites (like the Hot*ri*), and yet he is an object of respect. And with
gold they do nothing <span id="fr_278"></span>[3](#fn_278.md), and yet it
is an object of respect: therefore he presents to the Brahman three gold
pieces of a hundred mânas each.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:17">5:5:5:17</span></span>17.
Three milch cows (he gives) to the Hot*ri*;--for three milch cows mean
abundance, and the Hot*ri* means abundance: therefore (he gives) three
milch cows to the Hot*ri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:18">5:5:5:18</span></span>18.
Three garments (he gives) to the Adhvaryu;--for the Adhvaryu 'spreads'
the sacrifice, and the garments spread themselves (over the body) <span
id="fr_279"></span>[1](#fn_279): therefore (he gives.md) three garments to
the Adhvaryu. A bullock (he gives) to the Agnîdh <span
id="fr_280"></span>[2](#fn_280.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:5:19">5:5:5:19</span></span>19. Now
there are here either twelve, or thirteen gifts <span
id="fr_281"></span>[3](#fn_281.md), and there are either twelve or thirteen
months in the year;--the offering thus is of equal measure with the
year: that is why there are either twelve or thirteen sacrificial gifts.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_273"></span>[139:1](sbe4127.htm#fr_273.md) Cf. III, 2, 1, 28.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[140:1](sbe4127.htm#fr_274) For a (three days’.md)
Soma-sacrifice with a sacrificial fee of a thousand cows, the Trirâtra
Sahasradakshi*n*a, see part ii, p. 424.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[140:2](sbe4127.htm#fr_275.md) See part ii, pp.
426, 440 seq.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[141:1](sbe4127.htm#fr_276.md) Apparently the son
of A*g*âta*s*atru, king of Kâ*s*î, who is mentioned as having been very
proficient in speculative theology, and jealous, in this respect, of
king *G*anaka of Videha.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[141:2](sbe4127.htm#fr_277.md) According to
Sâya*n*a, these '*s*atamânas' are similar to the round plate worn by the
king during the Consecration-ceremony; see [p.
104](sbe4120.htm#page_104), note [2](sbe4120.htm#fn_206.md). These plates
(as the 'rukmas' generally, [VI, 7, 1, 2](sbe4149.htm#6:7:1:2) seq..md)
were apparently used for ornament only, not as coins.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[141:3](sbe4127.htm#fr_278.md) Sâya*n*a explains
this to mean that gold is not used for actual consumption, but only
indirectly, as for vessels on which food is served, or in traffic, as a
medium of barter;--the gold thus never losing its appearance, its
'glory.' See II, 2, 1, 5, 'Hence also one does not cleanse oneself with
it (?), nor does one do anything else with it.'

<span id="fn_279"></span>[142:1](sbe4127.htm#fr_279.md) Or, people spread
the clothes (either in weaving them, or in putting them on). 'To spread
the sacrifice' is the regular term for the ceremonial practice of
spreading the sacrificial fire from the Gârhapatya (or household fire)
over the other two hearths, and thus for the performance of the
sacrifice generally.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[142:2](sbe4127.htm#fr_280.md) See [p.
119](sbe4122.htm#page_119), note [2](sbe4122.htm#fn_234.md).

<span id="fn_281"></span>[142:3](sbe4127.htm#fr_281.md) That is, taking the
calves of the three milch cows into account: and optionally counting the
gift to the Âgnîdhra.
