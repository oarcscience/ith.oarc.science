### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:1">6:5:4:1</span></span>1. He now
digs that (hole) <span id="fr_477"></span>[3](#fn_475) in the earth; for
the gods now were afraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends,
will not smite here this (Agni) of

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

ours!' They made this (earth) to be his self (body), for protection,
thinking, 'The self will protect itself.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:2">6:5:4:2</span></span>2. He
digs him out with (the help of) Aditi, in order to guard him from
injury; for Aditi is this earth, and one does not injure one's own self;
but were he to dig with (the help of) another deity, he surely would
injure him (Agni).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:3">6:5:4:3</span></span>3. \[Vâ,
. S. XI, 61\] 'May the divine Aditi, clear to all the gods, dig thee,
Aṅgiras-like, O hole, in the lap of the earth!'--for this hole (is dug)
among the gods. That bamboo spade now disappears. This hole is
four-cornered, for there are four quarters: he thus digs it from all the
quarters <span id="fr_478"></span>[1](#fn_476). Having then laid down
fuel in it, he silently puts the 'invincible' (brick) thereon, for that
is made first.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:4">6:5:4:4</span></span>4. He
then sets down the fire-pan (with the bottom part upwards), with, 'May
the divine wives of the gods, dear to all the gods, place thee,
Aṅgiras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the
divine wives of the gods, dear to all the gods, indeed, like Aṅgiras,
placed that (fire-pan) into the lap of the earth, and by (the help of)
them he now places it. But, surely, these are the plants,--the wives of
the gods are indeed the plants; for by the plants everything here is
supported: by means of the plants he thus supports this (fire-pan). He
then lays down silently the all-light' (bricks). Having then placed fuel
thereon he kindles it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:5">6:5:4:5</span></span>5. 'May
the divine Dhisha*n*âs, dear to all the gods, kindle thee, Aṅgiras-like,
O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Dhisha*n*âs, dear
to all the gods, indeed kindled it, like Aṅgiras, in the lap of the
earth, and with their help he now kindles it. But, surely, this is Vâ*k*
(speech),--the Dhisha*n*âs are indeed speech <span
id="fr_479"></span>[1](#fn_477), for by speech everything is kindled
here: by means of speech he thus kindles this (fire-pan). Whilst looking
at it, he then mutters these three formulas:

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:6">6:5:4:6</span></span>6. 'May
the divine protectresses, dear to all the gods, heat thee, O fire-pan,
Aṅgiras-like, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine
protectresses, dear to all the gods, indeed, like Aṅgiras, heated it in
the lap of the earth; and by them he now heats it. But, surely, these
are the days and nights,--the protectresses are indeed the days and
nights; for by days and nights everything is covered here: by means of
the days and nights he thus heats it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:7">6:5:4:7</span></span>7. 'May
the divine ladies, dear to all the gods, bake thee, Aṅgiras-like, O
fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine ladies, dear
to all the gods, did, like Aṅgiras, bake it in the lap of the earth, and
with their help he now bakes it. But, surely, these are the metres,--the
ladies (gnâ) are indeed the metres (scripture texts), for by means of
these men go (gam) to the celestial world: by means of the metres he
thus bakes it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:8">6:5:4:8</span></span>8. 'May
the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, bake thee,
Aṅgiras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' for

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

of old the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, did
bake it, like Aṅgiras, in the lap of the earth; and with their help he
now bakes it. But, surely, these are the stars,--the women (*g*ani) are
indeed the stars, for these are the lights of those righteous men
(*g*ana) who go to the celestial world: it is by means of the stars that
he thus bakes it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:9">6:5:4:9</span></span>9. Now he
digs with one (formula), he sets down (the fire-pan) with one, he
kindles with one, he heats with one, he bakes (pa*k*) with two, whence
twice in the year food is ripened (pa*k*); these amount to six,--six
seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great
as is his measure, so great does this become.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:10">6:5:4:10</span></span>10. And
as often as he attends to (the fire by adding fresh fuel) <span
id="fr_480"></span>[1](#fn_478) he attends to it with the prayer
relating to Mitra, '\[The protection\] of Mitra, the preserver of
men <span id="fr_481"></span>[2](#fn_479) . . .;' for a friend (mitra)
does not injure any one, nor does any one injure his friend; and in like
manner does this one not injure that (fire-pan), nor does it (injure)
him. By day he should put (fuel) on it, by day he should clear it (of
the ashes).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:11">6:5:4:11</span></span>11. He
clears it (of the ashes) with a prayer relating to Savit*ri*,--for
Savit*ri* is the impeller: impelled

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

by Savit*ri*, he thus clears it--\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 63\] 'May the divine
Savit*ri*, the well-handed, well-fingered, and well-armed, clear thee by
his might!'--for Savit*ri* is all that.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:12">6:5:4:12</span></span>12. He
then turns it (the fire-pan) round, with. 'Not tottering upon the earth,
fill the regions, the quarters!'--that is, 'not tottering, fill thou
with sap the regions and quarters on earth!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:13">6:5:4:13</span></span>13. He
then takes it up, with \[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 641 'Having risen, do thou become
great,'--for these worlds, having risen, are great;--'and stand up
steadfast!' that is, 'stand thou up firm and fixed!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:14">6:5:4:14</span></span>14.
Having taken it in both hands, he sets it down, with, 'O Mitra, unto
thee I consign this fire-pan for safety: may it not break!' for Mitra is
that wind which blows yonder: it is to him he thus consigns it for
.protection; for these worlds are protected by Mitra (or by a friend),
whence nothing whatever is harmed in these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:15">6:5:4:15</span></span>15. He
then pours (milk) into it,--just for strength, or to (mark) the progress
of the work. And, again, why he pours (milk) into it,--that fire-pan is
the head of the sacrifice, and milk is breath: he thus lays breath into
the head. Moreover, the fire-pan (ukhâ, f.) is a female: he thus lays
milk into the female, whence there is milk in the female.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:16">6:5:4:16</span></span>16. He
pours goat's milk into it to avoid injury <span
id="fr_482"></span>[1](#fn_480); for the goat sprang from Pra*g*âpati's
head, and Pra*g*âpati is Agni; and one does not injure one's own self.
And as to why it is goat's (milk),--the goat eats all (kinds of) herbs:
he thus pours into it (the pan) the sap of all (kinds of) herbs.

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:4:17">6:5:4:17</span></span>17.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 65\] 'May the Vasus fill thee with the Gâyatrî metre,
Aṅgiras-like!--May the Rudras fill thee with the Trish*t*ubh metre,
Aṅgiras-like!--May the Âdityas fill thee with the *G*agatî metre,
Aṅgiras-like!--May the All-gods, dear to all men, fill thee with the
Anush*t*ubh metre, Aṅgiras-like!'--by these deities he thus moistens it:
by whatever deities he fashions it, by them he fumigates it, and by them
he moistens it. For he who performs a work, knows the practice of it:
hence by whatever deities he fashions it, by them he fumigates and
moistens it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_475"></span>[241:3](sbe4144.htm#fr_477) One might take
'athainam asyâ*m* khanati' to mean, 'he now digs for him (Agni) in the
earth,' or 'digs him into the earth.' Cf. [VI, 4, 1,
1](sbe4137.htm#6:4:1:1), 'athainam ata*h* khanati.' Sâya*n*a, however
(in accordance with the formula in [paragraph 3](sbe4144.htm#6:5:4:3)),
supplies 'ava*t*am,' 'a hole.'

<span id="fn_476"></span>[242:1](sbe4144.htm#fr_478) Sarvâbhyo digbhya
enam ava*t*a*m* khanati ta*m* *k*a sarvâsu dikshu nâsh*t*râ na
hi*m*santi, Sây.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[243:1](sbe4144.htm#fr_479) Whether
'Dhisha*n*â' (the name of certain female divinities who have the power
of bestowing prosperity and granting wishes) is here connected with
'dhish*n*ya,' fire-hearth; or whether it is taken by the author in some
such primary sense as 'intelligence' or 'inspiration,' it were difficult
to decide. Sâya*n*a connects it with 'dhî,'--vâg vai dhisha*n*â, sâ hi
dhiya*m* karma *gñ*âvâsani (?) sambha*g*ate.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[244:1](sbe4144.htm#fr_480) The St. Petersburg
dictionary seems to take 'yâvat kiya*k* *k*opanyâ*k*arati' in the sense
of 'as much (or, as deep) as he enters (into the pan).' But see III, 2,
2, 29, where 'yâvat kiya*kk*a . . . upasp*ris*et' has likewise the
meaning 'as often as he touches.' Cf. also Kâty. Sr. XVI, 4, 15, He
keeps up (the fire by adding fuel), with 'Mitrasya . . .;' 16, \[He
repeats the formula\] as often (or long) as he keeps it up (or, adds
fuel).

<span id="fn_479"></span>[244:2](sbe4144.htm#fr_481) Vâ*g*. S. XI, 62;
*Ri*k S. III, 59, 6, 'The gainful protection of the God Mitra, the
preserver of men, is glorious and of most wonderful renown.'

<span id="fn_480"></span>[245:1](sbe4144.htm#fr_482) The construction of
this, and similar previous passages, is the same as that referred to in
part ii, p. 15, note 3.
