### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:3:1">6:5:3:1</span></span>1. Of
that same (clay) she (the queen) forms the first, the 'invincible'
(brick); for the invincible one (Ashâ*dh*â) is this earth, and this
earth was created first of these worlds. She forms it of that same clay,
for this earth is (one) of these worlds. The (Sacrificer's) consecrated
consort (mahishî) forms it: for this earth is a 'mahishî' (female
buffalo, a cow). She who is first taken to wife is the consecrated
consort.

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:3:2">6:5:3:2</span></span>2. It
measures a foot (in length and breadth), for the foot is a foundation,
and this earth also is a foundation. It is marked with three lines, for
this earth is threefold <span id="fr_472"></span>[1](#fn_470).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:3:3">6:5:3:3</span></span>3. Now he
(the Sacrificer) makes the fire-pan: he thereby makes these worlds. He
then makes the (three) 'all-light' (bricks), that is these deities,
Agni, Vâyu, Âditya, for those deities indeed are all the light. He makes
them from that same clay (as the fire-pan): he thus produces these gods
from these worlds. The Sacrificer makes them. They are marked with three
lines, for threefold are these gods <span
id="fr_473"></span>[2](#fn_471). Thus as regards the deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:3:4">6:5:3:4</span></span>4. Now as
regards the self (or body): the fire-pan, indeed, is the self (of Agni).
The 'invincible' (brick) is speech: that she (the wife) makes first, for
this speech is foremost in the body. She makes it from that same clay,
for this speech is of the body. The (Sacrificer's) consecrated consort
makes it, for speech is a 'mahishî.' It is marked with three lines, for
speech is divided into three kinds, *Ri*k-verses, Ya*g*us-formulas, and
Sâman-tunes; and because of this threefold form of speech, low-voiced,
half-loud, and loud.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:3:5">6:5:3:5</span></span>5. He
makes the fire-pan: thereby he makes (Agni's) self. He then makes the
'all-light' (bricks),--the 'all-light' (brick) is offspring, for
offspring indeed is all the light: he thus causes generation to take
place. He makes them of the same clay (as the fire-pan): he thus
produces offspring from the self. The Sacrificer makes them: the
Sacrificer thus

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

produces offspring from his own self. He makes them without
interruption: he thus produces uninterrupted offspring from his own
self. He makes them subsequently (to the fire-pan): he thus produces the
offspring subsequently to his own self. They are marked with three
lines, for generation is threefold, father, mother, and son; or, the
embryo, and the inner and outer membrane.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:3:6">6:5:3:6</span></span>6. He
makes these from (clay) prepared with prayer, the others from (clay)
prepared without prayer; for these are defined, the others undefined;
these are limited (in number), the others unlimited.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:3:7">6:5:3:7</span></span>7. That
Agni is Pra*g*âpati; but Pra*g*âpati is both of this, defined and
undefined, limited and unlimited: thus when he makes (bricks) from
(clay) prepared with prayer, he thereby makes up that form of his
(Pra*g*âpati's) which is defined and limited; and when he makes them
from (clay) prepared without prayer, he thereby makes up that form of
his which is undefined and unlimited. Verily, then, whosoever knowing
this does it on this wise, makes up the whole and complete Agni. From
the (clay) lying ready prepared, he leaves over a lump for
expiations <span id="fr_474"></span>[1](#fn_472).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:3:8">6:5:3:8</span></span>8. He
(the Adhvaryu) now fumigates it (the fire-pan)--just for the sake of
strength, or to (mark) the progress of the work. And, again, as to why
he fumigates,--that fire-pan is the head of the sacrifice, and the smoke
its breath: he thus puts breath into the head.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:3:9">6:5:3:9</span></span>9. He
fumigates it with horse-dung, to insure it against injury; for the horse
is sacred to Pra*g*âpati,

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

and Pra*g*âpati is Agni, and one does not injure one's own self. And
with dung (he does it) because that is what was eaten (by the horse) and
is useless; and thus he does not injure the horse itself, nor the other
cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:3:10">6:5:3:10</span></span>10.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 60\] 'May the Vasus make thee fragrant by the Gâyatrî
measure, Aṅgiras-like!--May the Rudras make thee fragrant by the
Trish*t*ubh metre, Aṅgiras-like!--May the Âdityas make thee fragrant by
the *G*agatî metre, Aṅgiras-like!--May the All-gods, the friends of all
men, make thee fragrant by the Anush*t*ubh metre, Aṅgiras-like!--May
Indra make thee fragrant!--May Varu*n*a make thee fragrant!--May
Vish*n*u make thee fragrant!'--he thus fumigates it by means of the
deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:3:11">6:5:3:11</span></span>11.
Seven balls of horse-dung are (used), and seven formulas: those deities
are sevenfold <span id="fr_475"></span>[1](#fn_473), and seven vital
airs there are in the head. But also what is many times, seven times
seven, is (expressed by) seven <span id="fr_476"></span>[2](#fn_474): he
thus puts the seven vital airs into the head.
