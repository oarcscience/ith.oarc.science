<p>THE first of the three K&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>as contained in the present volume continues the dogmatic discussion of the different forms of Soma-sacrifice, in connection with which two important ceremonies, the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya and R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, are considered. From a ritualistic point of view, there is a radical difference between these two ceremonies. The R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, or 'inauguration of a king,' strictly speaking, is not a Soma-sacrifice, but rather a complex religious ceremony which includes, amongst other rites, the performance of a number of Soma-sacrifices of different kinds. The V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya, or 'drink of strength' (or, perhaps, 'the race-cup'), on the other hand, is recognised as one of the different forms (sa<I>m</I>sth&acirc;) which a single Soma-sacrifice may take. As a matter of fact, however, this form hardly ever occurs, as most of the others constantly do, in connection with, and as a constituent element of, other ceremonies, but is almost exclusively performed as an independent sacrifice. The reason why this sacrifice has received a special treatment in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, between the Agnish<I>t</I>oma and the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, doubtless is that, unlike the other forms of Soma-sacrifice, it has some striking features of its own which stamp it, like the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, as a political ceremony. According to certain ritualistic authorities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_0"></A><A HREF="#fn_0"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, indeed, the performance of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya should be arranged in much the same way as that of the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya; that is, just as the central ceremony of the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, viz. the Abhishe<I>k</I>an&icirc;ya or consecration, is preceded and followed by certain other Soma-days, so the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya should be preceded and followed by exactly corresponding ceremonies.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The preceding K&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>a was chiefly taken up with a detailed discussion of the simplest form of a complete Soma-sacrifice, the Agnish<I>t</I>oma, serving as the model for all other kinds of one-day (ek&acirc;ha) Soma-sacrifices; and it also adverted incidentally to some of the special features of such of the remaining fundamental forms of Soma-sacrifice as are required for the performance of sacrificial periods of from two to twelve pressing-days--the so-called ah&icirc;na-sacrifices--as well as for the performance of the sacrificial sessions (sattra) lasting from twelve days upwards. As the discussion of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya presupposes a knowledge of several of those fundamental forms of Soma-sacrifice, it may not be out of place here briefly to recapitulate their characteristic features.</p>  
<p>The ek&acirc;ha, or 'one-day' sacrifices, arc those Soma-sacrifices which have a single pressing-day, consisting of three services (or pressings, savana)--the morning, midday, and third (or evening) services--at each of which certain cups of Soma-liquor are drawn, destined to be ultimately consumed by the priests and sacrificer, after libations to the respective deities have been duly made therefrom. At certain stated times during the performance, hymns (stotra) are chanted by the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s; each of which is followed by an appropriate recitation (<I>s</I>astra) of Vedic hymns or detached verses, by the Hot<I>ri</I> priest or one of his assistants. An integral part of each Soma-sacrifice, moreover, is the animal sacrifice (pa<I>s</I>ubandhu); the number of victims varying according to the particular form of sacrifice adopted. In the exposition of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma, the animal offering actually described (part ii, p. 162, seq.) is that of a he-goat to Agni and Soma, intended to serve as the model for all other animal sacrifices. This description is inserted in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a among the ceremonies of <A HREF="errata.htm#0">the day preceding the Soma-day, the animal offering to Agni-Soma being indeed a constant feature of that day's proceedings at every Soma-sacrifice; whilst the slaughter of the special victim, or victims, of the respective sacrifice takes place during the morning service</A>, and the meat-oblations are made during the evening service of the pressing-day. The ritualistic works enumerate a considerable number of 'one-day' sacrifices, all of them with special features of their</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xiii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xiii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>own; most of these sacrifices are, however, merely modifications of one or other of the fundamental forms of ek&acirc;has. Of such forms or sa<I>m</I>sth&acirc;s--literally, 'completions,' being so called because the final chants or ceremonies are their most characteristic features--the ritual system recognises seven, viz. the Agnish<I>t</I>oma. Atyagnish<I>t</I>oma. Ukthya, Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in, V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#fn_1"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, Atir&acirc;tra, and Aptory&acirc;ma.</p>  
<p>The Agnish<I>t</I>oma, the simplest and most common form of Soma-sacrifice, requires the immolation of a single victim, a he-goat to Agni; and the chanting of twelve stotras, viz. the Bahish-pavam&acirc;na and four &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya-stotras at the morning service; the M&acirc;dhyandina-pavam&acirc;na and four P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotras at the midday service; and the T<I>ri</I>t&icirc;ya (or &Acirc;rbhava)-pavam&acirc;na and the Agnish<I>t</I>oma-s&acirc;man at the evening service. It is this last-named chant, then, that gives its name to this sacrifice which, indeed, is often explained as the 'Agnish<I>t</I>oma-sa<I>m</I>stha<I>h</I> kratu<I>h</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#fn_2"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,' or the sacrifice concluding with 'Agni's praise.' The term 's&acirc;man,' in its narrow technical sense, means a choral melody, a hymn-tune, without reference to the words set thereto. Not unfrequently, however, it has to be taken in the wider sense of a chanted verse or hymn (triplet), a chorale; but, though the distinction is evidently of some importance for the ritual, it is not always easy to determine the particular sense in which the term is meant to be applied, viz. whether a specified s&acirc;man is intended to include the original text set to the respective tune, or whether some other verses to which that tune has been adapted are intended. In the case of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma-s&acirc;man, however, the word 's&acirc;man' cannot be taken in its narrow acceptation, but the term has to be understood in the sense of 'a hymn chanted in praise of Agni.' The words commonly used for this chant, are the first two verses of Rig-veda S. VI, 48, a hymn indeed</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xiv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xiv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>admirably adapted for the purpose of singing Agni's praises. For the first verse, beginning 'ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;-ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc; vo agnaye,' the chief tune-book, the Gr&acirc;mageya-g&acirc;na, has preserved four different tunes, all of which are ascribed to the <I>Ri</I>shi Bharadv&acirc;<I>g</I>a: one of them has, however, come to be generally accepted as the Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&icirc;ya-tune &#0954;&#0945;&#0964;&#8125; &#7952;&#0958;&#0959;&#0967;&#0942;&#0957;, and has been made use of for this and numerous other triplets&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#fn_3"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; whilst the other tunes seem to have met with little favour, not one of them being represented in the triplets arranged for chanting in stotras, as given in the &Ucirc;ha and Uhya-g&acirc;nas. Neither the Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&icirc;ya-tune, nor its original text, is however a fixed item in the chanting of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma-s&acirc;man. Thus, for the first two verses of Rig-veda VI, 48, the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya-sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> substitutes verses nine and ten of the same hymn, and these are chanted, not to the Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&icirc;ya, but to the V&acirc;ravant&icirc;ya-tune, originally composed for, and named after, Rig-veda I, 27, 1 (S. V. I, 17; ed. Calc. I, p. 121) 'a<I>s</I>va<I>m</I> na tv&acirc; v&acirc;ravantam.'</p>  
<p>The Ukthya-sacrifice requires the slaughtering of a second victim, a he-goat to Indra and Agni; and to the twelve chants of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma it adds three more, the so-called Uktha-stotras, each of which is again followed by an Uktha-<I>s</I>astra recited by one of the Hotrakas, or assistants of the Hot<I>ri</I>. As the evening service of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma had only two <I>s</I>astras, both recited by the Hot<I>ri</I>, the addition of the three <I>s</I>astras of the Hotrakas would, in this respect, equalize the evening to the morning and midday savanas. The word 'uktha' is explained by later lexicographers either as a synonym of 's&acirc;man,' or as a kind of s&acirc;man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; but it is not unlikely that that meaning of the word was directly derived from this, the most common, use of the word in the term 'uktha-stotra.' The etymology of the word&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, at all events, would point to the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>meaning 'verse, hymn,' rather than to that of 'tune' or 'chant;' but, be that as it may, the word is certainly used in the former sense in the term 'mahad-uktha,' the name of the 'great recitation' of a thousand b<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, being the Hot<I>ri</I>'s <I>s</I>astra in response to the Mah&acirc;vrata-stotra at the last but one day of the Gav&acirc;m-ayana. And, besides, at the Agnish<I>t</I>oma a special 'ukthya' cup of Soma-juice is drawn both at the morning and midday pressings, but not at the evening savana. This cup, which is eventually shared by the three principal Hotrakas between them, is evidently intended as their reward for the recitation of their 'ukthas.' At the Ukthya-sacrifice, as might have been expected, the same cup is likewise drawn at the evening service. Though it may be taken for granted, therefore, that 'uktha' was an older term for '<I>s</I>astra,' it still seems somewhat strange that this terns should have been applied specially to the additional <I>s</I>astras and stotras of the Ukthya-sacrifice. Could it be that the name of the additional Ukthya-cup, as a distinctive feature of this sacrifice, suggested the name for the <I>s</I>astras and stotras with which that cup was connected, or have we rather to look for some such reason as Ait. Br. VI, 13 might seem to indicate? This passage contains a discussion regarding the different status of the Hotrakas who have ukthas of their own, and those who have not; and it then proceeds to consider the difference that exists between the two first and the third savanas of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma in respect of the Hotrakas&#8217; ukthas. It is clear that here also, the term 'uktha' can hardly be taken otherwise than as referring to</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xvi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xvi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the <I>s</I>astras--though, no doubt, the stotra is sometimes said to belong to the priest who recites the <I>s</I>astra in response to it--and this paragraph of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a reads almost like the echo of an old discussion as to whether or not there should be recitations for the Hotrakas at the evening service of a complete Soma-sacrifice. If, in this way, the question of uktha or no uktha had become a sort of catchword for ritualistic controversy, one could understand how the term came ultimately to be applied to the three additional stotras and <I>s</I>astras.</p>  
<p>Not unfrequently, the Ukthya is treated merely as a redundant Agnish<I>t</I>oma, as an 'Agnish<I>t</I>oma<I>h</I> soktha<I>h</I>,' or Agnish<I>t</I>oma with the Ukthas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Considering, however, that the term Agnish<I>t</I>oma, properly speaking, belongs only to a Soma-sacrifice which ends with the Agnish<I>t</I>oma (s&acirc;man), and that the addition of the Uktha-stotras also involves considerable modifications in the form of most of the preceding chants, a new term such as Ukthya, based on the completing and characteristic chants of this form of sacrifice, was decidedly more convenient. In regard to the composition of the preceding stotras, with the exception of the M&acirc;dhyandina-pavam&acirc;na and the Agnish<I>t</I>oma-s&acirc;man, the Ukthya, indeed, may be said to constitute a parallel form of Sacrifice beside the Agnish<I>t</I>oma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the succeeding sa<I>m</I>sth&acirc;s following the model of either the one or the other of these two parallel forms.</p>  
<p>The Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in-sacrifice requires, as a third victim, the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xvii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xvii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>immolation of a ram to Indra; and one additional chant, the sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>i-stotra, with its attendant <I>s</I>astra and Soma-cup. The most natural explanation of the name is the one supplied, in the first place, by Ait. Br. IV, 1 (as interpreted by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a)--viz. the sacrifice which has sixteen, or a sixteenth, stotra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. But, as the name applies not only to the sacrifice but also to the stotra and <I>s</I>astra, the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a further justifies the name by the peculiar composition of the sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>i-<I>s</I>astra in which the number sixteen prevails&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Very probably, however, the name may have belonged to the sacrifice long before the <I>s</I>astra, for symbolic reasons, had assumed the peculiar form it now presents.</p>  
<p>In this summary of the characteristic features of the forms of Soma-sacrifice presupposed by the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya, no mention has yet been made of the Atyagnish<I>t</I>oma, or redundant Agnish<I>t</I>oma, which usually occupies the second place in the list of sa<I>m</I>sth&acirc;s. This form of sacrifice is indeed very little used, and there can be little doubt that it was introduced into the system, as Professor Weber suggests, merely for the sake of bringing up the Soma-sa<I>m</I>sth&acirc;s to the sacred number of seven. This sacrifice is obtained by the addition of the sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>i-stotra to the twelve chants of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma, as well as of the special Soma-cup and sacrificial victim for Indra, connected with that chant. It may thus be considered as a short form of the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in-sacrifice (though without the full complement of stotras implied in that name), which might have suited the views of such ritualists as held the <I>s</I>astras of the Hotrakas at the evening service to be superfluous&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The distinctive feature of the Atir&acirc;tra-sacrifice, as the name itself indicates, is an 'overnight' performance of chants and recitations, consisting of three rounds of four stotras and <I>s</I>astras each. At the end of each round</p>  
<p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (pary&acirc;ya) libations are offered, followed by the inevitable potations of Soma-liquor. That the performance, indeed, partook largely of the character of a regular nocturnal carousal, may be gathered from the fact, specially mentioned in the Aitareya Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, that each of the Hot<I>ri</I>'s offering-formulas is to contain the three words--'andhas,' Soma-plant (or liquor), 'p&acirc;,' to drink, and 'mada,' intoxication. Accordingly, one of the formulas used is Rig-veda II, 19, 1 ap&acirc;yy asy&acirc;<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>ndhaso mad&acirc;ya, 'there has been drunk (by Indra, or by us) of this juice for intoxication.' The twelve stotras, each of which is chanted to a different tune, are followed up, at daybreak, by the Sandhi-stotra, or twilight-chant, consisting of six verses (S&acirc;ma-veda S. II, 99-104) chanted to the Rathantara-tune. This chant is succeeded by the Hot<I>ri</I>'s recitation of the &Acirc;<I>s</I>vina-<I>s</I>astra, a modification of the ordinary 'pr&acirc;tar-anuv&acirc;ka,' or morning-litany, by which the pressing-day of a Soma-sacrifice is ushered in&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The Atir&acirc;tra also requires a special victim, viz. a he-goat offered to Sarasvat&icirc;, the goddess of speech. As regards the ceremonies preceding the night-performance, there is again a difference of opinion among ritualists as to whether the sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>i-stotra, with its attendant rites, is, or is not, a necessary element of the Atir&acirc;tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Some authorities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, accordingly, distinctly recognise two different kinds of Atir&acirc;tra,--one with, and the other without, the sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in. In K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana's S&ucirc;tra, there is no allusion to any difference of opinion on this point, but, in specifying the victims required at the different Soma-sacrifices, he merely remarks (IX, 8, 5) that, 'At the Atir&acirc;tra there is a fourth victim to Sarasvat&icirc;.' This would certainly seem to imply that there are also to be the three preceding victims, including the one to Indra peculiar to the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in. &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana (V, 11, 1) also refers incidentally to the sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in as part of the</p>

<p><A NAME="page_xix"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xix</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Atir&acirc;tra, though it is not quite clear from the text of the s&ucirc;tra whether it is meant to be a necessary or only an optional feature of that sacrifice. The Aitareya <A HREF="errata.htm#1">Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a</A> (IV, 6), on the other hand, in treating of the Atir&acirc;tra, enters on a discussion with the view of showing that the night-performance of that sacrifice is in every respect equal to the preceding day-performance; and accordingly, as the three services of the day-performance include fifteen chants and recitations (viz. the twelve of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma, and the three Ukthas), so, during the night, the three rounds of in all twelve stotras, together with the sandhi-stotra, here counted as three stotras (triplets), make up the requisite fifteen chants. This Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, then, does not recognise the sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in as part of the Atir&acirc;tra, and, indeed, the manuals of the Atir&acirc;tra chants which I have consulted make no mention of the sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>i-stotra, though it is distinctly mentioned there among the chants of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya and the Aptory&acirc;ma. The passage in the Aitareya, just referred to, also seems to raise the question as to whether the Atir&acirc;tra is really an ek&acirc;ha, or whether it is not rather an ah&icirc;na-sacrifice. On this point also the authorities seem to differ; whilst most writers take the Atir&acirc;tra. and the analogous Aptory&acirc;ma, to be 'one-day' sacrifices, the T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (XX) and L&acirc;<I>t</I>y. IX, 5, 6 class them along with the Ah&icirc;nas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and they may indeed be regarded as intermediate links between the two classes of Soma-sacrifice, inasmuch as, in a continued sacrificial performance, the final recitations of these sacrifices take the place of the opening ceremony of the next day's performance. Such, for instance, is the case in the performance of the Atir&acirc;tra as the opening day of the Dv&acirc;da<I>s</I>&acirc;ha, or twelve days&#8217; period of sacrifice; whilst in the performance of the twelfth and concluding day, which is likewise an Atir&acirc;tra, the concluding ceremonies of the latter might be considered in</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xx"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xx</FONT></A></p>  
<p>a manner superabundant. It is probably in this sense that L&acirc;<I>t</I>y. (IX, 5, 4) calls the overnight performance of the last day of an ah&icirc;na (e. g. the Dv&acirc;da<I>s</I>&acirc;ha) the ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>apu<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a, or tail of the sacrifice, which is to fall beyond the month for which, from the time of the initiation, the ah&icirc;na is to last.</p>  
<p>The Aptory&acirc;ma-sacrifice represents an amplified form of the Atir&acirc;tra. It requires the sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>i-stotra and the ceremonies connected with it as a necessary element of its performance; whilst its distinctive feature consists in four additional (atirikta-) stotras and <I>s</I>astras, chanted and recited after the &Acirc;<I>s</I>vina-<I>s</I>astra, the concluding recitation of the Atir&acirc;tra. These four chants are arranged in such a manner that each successive stotra is chanted to a different tune, and in a more advanced form of composition, from the triv<I>ri</I>t (nine-versed) up to the ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a (twenty-one-versed) stoma. In the liturgical manuals, the Aptory&acirc;ma, moreover, performs the function of serving as the model for a sacrificial performance with all the 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' Though this mode of chanting has been repeatedly referred to in the translation and notes, a few additional remarks on this subject may not be out of place here. When performed in its 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a' form, the stotra is so arranged that a certain s&acirc;man (or chanted triplet) is enclosed, as the 'garbha' (embryo), within some other s&acirc;man which, as its 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a' (i.e. back, or flanks), is chanted a number of times before and after the verses of the central s&acirc;man. The tunes most commonly used for forming the enclosing s&acirc;mans of a P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra are the Rathantara and B<I>ri</I>hat; and along with these, four others are singled out to make up the six P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-s&acirc;mans &#0954;&#0945;&#0964;&#8125; &#7952;&#0958;&#0959;&#0967;&#0942;&#0957;, viz. the Vair&ucirc;pa (with the text S&acirc;ma-veda II, 212-13), Vair&acirc;<I>g</I>a (II, 277-9), <I>S</I>&acirc;kvara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (chanted on the Mah&acirc;n&acirc;mn&icirc; verses,</p>

<p>the B<I>ri</I>hat forms the 'garbha,' or enclosed s&acirc;man, of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma-s&acirc;man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; the Vair&ucirc;pa the garbha of the third, the Vair&acirc;<I>g</I>a that of the first, the <I>S</I>&acirc;kvara that of the second, and the Raivata that of the fourth, P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra. It is doubtless this feature which gives to certain Soma-days the name of 'sarvap<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a,' or one performed with all the (six) P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>as. Then, as regards the particular stotras that are chanted in the proper 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a' form, these include not only the four so-called P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotras of the midday service, but also the four &Acirc;gya-stotras of the morning service, as well as the Agnish<I>t</I>oma-s&acirc;man and the three Uktha-stotras of the evening service,--in short, all the first fifteen stotras with the exception of the three Pavam&acirc;na-stotras. Of the stotras which succeed the Ukthas, on the other hand--viz. the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in, the twelve chants of the three night-rounds, the Sandhi-stotra, and the four Atirikta-stotras--not one is performed in the 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a' form. How often the several verses of the 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-s&acirc;man,' and those of the 'garbha' are to be chanted, of course depends, in each case, not only on the particular stoma which has to be performed, but also on the particular mode (vish<I>t</I>uti) prescribed, or selected, for the stoma. Thus, while all the four &Acirc;gya-stotras are chanted in the pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a, or fifteen-versed-stoma; the four P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotras are to be performed in the ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a (of twenty-one verses), the <I>k</I>aturvi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a (of twenty-four verses), the <I>k</I>atu<I>s</I><I>k</I>atv&acirc;ri<I>m</I><I>s</I>a (of forty-four verses), and the ash<I>t</I>&acirc;<I>k</I>atv&acirc;ri<I>m</I><I>s</I>a (of forty-eight verses) respectively. Now whenever, as in the case of the pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a and the ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a-stomas, the number of verses is divisible by three, one third of the total number of verses is usually assigned to each of the three parts of the stotra, and distributed over the respective (three or sometimes four) verses of that s&acirc;man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> To illustrate this tripartite composition, the Hot<I>ri</I>'s P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra, performed in the twenty-one-versed stoma. may be taken as an example. For the 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a,' the manuals give the B<I>ri</I>hat-s&acirc;man, on its original text (S&acirc;ma-veda II, 159,160, 'tv&acirc;m id dhi hav&acirc;mahe,' arranged so as to form three verses), though the Rathantara may be used instead&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. For the 'garbha,' or enclosed s&acirc;man, on the other hand, the Vair&acirc;<I>g</I>a-s&acirc;man (with its original text, S. V. II, 277-9, 'pib&acirc; somam indra mandatu tv&acirc;') is to be used, a most elaborate tune&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, with long sets of stobhas, or musical ejaculations, inserted in the text. Of the twenty-one verses, of which the stoma consists, seven verses would thus fall to the share of the 'garbha,' and seven verses to that of the p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a,' as chanted before and after the 'garbha.' Thus, in accordance with the formula set forth in <A HREF="#page_xxii">p. xxii</A>, note <A HREF="#fn_22">2</A>, the three verses (a, b, c) of the B<I>ri</I>hat would be chanted in the form aaa-bbb-c; then the verses of the Vair&acirc;<I>g</I>a-s&acirc;man (as 'garbha') in the form a-bbb-ccc; and finally again the B<I>ri</I>hat in the form aaa-b-ccc. Stotras, the total number of verses of which is not divisible by three, of course require a slightly different distribution. Thus, of the third P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra, the stoma of which consists of forty-four verses, the two parts of the 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a' obtain fifteen verses each, whilst the 'garbha' has only fourteen verses for its share.</p>  
<p>The V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya, the last of the seven forms of a complete Soma-sacrifice, occupies an independent position beside the Atir&acirc;tra and Aptory&acirc;ma, whose special features it does not share. Like them, it starts from the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in, to the characteristic (sixteenth) chant (and recitation) of which it acids one more stotra, the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya-s&acirc;man, chanted to the B<I>ri</I>hat-tune, in the Saptada<I>s</I>a (seventeen-versed) stoma, and followed by the recitation of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya-<I>s</I>astra. The Saptada<I>s</I>a-stoma, indeed, is so characteristic of this sacrifice that--as has been set forth at <A HREF="sbe4104.htm#page_8">p. 8</A> note</p>

<p>below--all the preceding chants, from the Bahishpavam&acirc;na onward, are remodelled in accordance with it. Besides, over and above the three victims of the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in-sacrifice, the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya requires, not only a fourth one, sacred to Sarasvat&icirc;, the goddess of speech, but also a set of seventeen victims for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, the god of creatures and procreation. As regards other rites peculiar to the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya, the most interesting, doubtless, is the chariot-race in which the sacrificer, who must be either of the royal or of the priestly order, is allowed to carry off the palm, and from which this sacrifice perhaps derives its name. Professor Hillebrandt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, indeed, would claim for this feature of the sacrifice the character of a relic of an old national festival, a kind of Indian Olympic games; and though there is perhaps hardly sufficient evidence to bear out this conjecture, it cannot at least be denied that this feature has a certain popular look about it.</p>  
<p>Somewhat peculiar are the relations between the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya and the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya on the one hand, and between the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya and the B<I>ri</I>haspatisava on the other. In the first chapter of the fifth book, the author of this part of our Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is at some pains to impress the fact that the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya is a ceremony of superior value and import to the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya; and hence K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana (XV, 1, 1-2) has two rules to the effect that the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya may be performed by a king who has not yet performed the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya. These authorities would thus seem to consider the drinking of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya-cup a more than sufficient equivalent for the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, or inauguration of a king; they do not, however, say that the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya must be performed prior to the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya, but only maintain that the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya cannot be performed after the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya. The R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, according to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, confers on the sacrificer royal dignity (r&acirc;<I>g</I>ya), and the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya paramount sovereignty (s&acirc;mr&acirc;<I>g</I>ya). It might almost seem as if the relatively loose positions here assigned to the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya were entirely owing to the fact that it is a purely Kshatriya ceremony to which the</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxv</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a has no right, whilst the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya may be performed by Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as as well as Kshatriyas. But on whatever grounds this appreciation of the two ceremonies may be based, it certainly goes right in the face of the rule laid down by &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana (IX, 9, 19) that, 'after performing the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya, a king may perform the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, and a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a the B<I>ri</I>haspatisava.' With this rule would seem to accord the relative value assigned to the two ceremonies in the Taittir&icirc;ya Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (V, 6, 2, 1) and Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (II, 7, 6, 1), according to which the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya is a 'samr&acirc;<I>t</I>sava,' or consecration to the dignity of a paramount sovereign, while the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya is called a 'varu<I>n</I>asava,' i.e., according to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, a consecration to the universal sway wielded by Varu<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. In much the same sense we have doubtless to understand the rule in which L&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;yana defines the object of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya (VIII, 11, 1), viz. 'Whomsoever the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as and kings (or nobles) may place at their head, let him perform the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya.' All these authorities, with the exception of the <I>S</I>atapatha-Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a and K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana, are thus agreed in making the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya a preliminary ceremony, performed by a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who is raised to the dignity of a Purohita, or head-priest (so to speak, a minister of worship, and court-priest), or by a king who is elected paramount sovereign by a number of petty r&acirc;<I>g</I>as; this sacrifice being in due time followed by the respective installation and consecration ceremony, viz. the B<I>ri</I>haspatisava, in the case of the Purohita; and the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, in that of the king. In regard to the B<I>ri</I>haspatisava, which these authorities place on an equality with the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, our Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a finds itself in a somewhat awkward position, and it gets out of its difficulty (V, 2, 1, 19) by simply identifying the B<I>ri</I>haspatisava with the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya, and making the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya itself to be 'the consecration of B<I>ri</I>haspati;' and K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana (XIV, 1, 2) compromises matters by combining the two ceremonies in this way that he who performs the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya is to perform the B<I>ri</I>haspatisava for a fortnight before and after the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya.</p>

<p><A NAME="page_xxvi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxvi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, or inauguration of a king, is a complex ceremony which, according to the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras, consists of a long succession of sacrificial performances, spread over a period of upwards of two years. It includes seven distinct Soma-sacrifices, viz. 1, the Pavitra, an Agnish<I>t</I>oma serving as the opening sacrifice, and followed, after an interval of a year (during which the seasonal sacrifices have to be performed), by 2, the Abhishe<I>k</I>an&icirc;ya, an Ukthya-sacrifice, being the consecration (or anointing) ceremony. Then follows 3, the Da<I>s</I>apeya, or 'drink of ten,' an Agnish<I>t</I>oma, so-called because ten priests take part in drinking the Soma-liquor contained in each of the ten cups. After another year's interval&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, during which monthly 'offerings to the beams (i.e. the months)' are made, takes place 4, the Ke<I>s</I>avapan&icirc;ya, or hair-cutting ceremony, an Atir&acirc;tra-sacrifice; followed, after a month or fortnight, by d, and 6, the Vyush<I>t</I>i-dvir&acirc;tra, or two nights&#8217; ceremony of the dawning, consisting of an Agnish<I>t</I>oma and an Atir&acirc;tra and finally 7, the Kshatra-dh<I>ri</I>ti, or 'the wielding of the (royal) power,' an Agnish<I>t</I>oma performed a month later. The round of ceremonies concludes with the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, an ish<I>t</I>i the object of which is to make amends for any excess committed in the consumption of Soma-liquor.</p>  
<p>The fifth book completes the dogmatic discussion of the ordinary circle of sacrifices, some less common, or altogether obsolete, ceremonies, such as the A<I>s</I>vamedha (horse-sacrifice), Purushamedha (human sacrifice), Sarvamedha (sacrifice for universal rule), being dealt with, by way of supplement, in the thirteenth book.</p>  
<p>With the sixth K&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, we enter on the detailed explanation of the Agni<I>k</I>ayana, or building of the fire-altar, a very solemn ceremony which would seem originally to have stood apart from, if not in actual opposition to, the ordinary sacrificial system, but which, in the end. apparently by some ecclesiastical compromise, was added</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxvii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxvii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>on to the Soma ritual as an important, though not indispensable, element of it. The avowed object of this ceremony is the super-exaltation of Agni, the Fire, who, in the elaborate cosmogenic legend with which this section begins, is identified with Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, the lord of Generation, and the source of life in the world. As the present volume contains, however, only a portion of the Agni<I>k</I>ayana ritual, any further remarks on this subject may be reserved for a future occasion.</p>  
<p>Since the time when this volume went to press, the literature of the Soma myth has been enriched by the appearance of an important book, the first volume of Professor A. Hillebrandt's Vedische Mythologie, dealing with Soma and cognate gods. As it is impossible for me here to enter into a detailed discussion of the numerous points raised in the work, I must content myself for the present with the remark that I believe Professor Hillebrandt to have fully established the main point of his position, viz. the identity of Soma with the Moon in early Vedic mythology.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_9"></A><A HREF="sbe4102.htm#fr_9">xvi:2</A> Perhaps the most characteristic point of difference between these two forms in which the fundamental stotras are chanted is the first (or Hot<I>ri</I>'s) P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra at the midday service. Whilst the Agnish<I>t</I>oma here requires the Rathantara-tune chanted on the text, S&acirc;ma-vela S. II, 30, 31; the Ukthya, on the other hand, requires the text, S. V.

Professor Hillebrandt, l.c., p. 22, has, indeed, tried to show that these two tunes play an important part in early India in connection with the celebration of the solstices.

<P><A NAME="fn_17"></A><A HREF="sbe4102.htm#fr_17">xx:1</A> From &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana's rule (IX, 11, 4), 'If they chant in forming the garbha (i.e. in the 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a' form), let him (the Hot<I>ri</I> or Hotraka) recite in the same way the stotriyas and anur&ucirc;pas,' it seems, however, clear that the Aptory&acirc;ma may also be performed without the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>as.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_18"></A><A HREF="sbe4102.htm#fr_18">xx:2</A> The original text of the S&acirc;kvara-s&acirc;man is stated (by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a on Aitar. Br. IV, 13; Mah&icirc;dhara on V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. X, 14, &amp;c.) to be S&acirc;ma-veda II, 1152-3, 'pro shv asmai puroratham,' but the S&acirc;ma-veda G&acirc;nas do not seem to give the tune <A NAME="page_xxi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxi</FONT></A> with that text, but with the Mah&acirc;n&acirc;mn&icirc; verses (ed. Bibl. Ind. II, p. 371). The T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya Br. XIII, 4 (and comm.), gives minute directions as to the particular p&acirc;das of the first three Mah&acirc;n&acirc;mn&icirc; triplets which are singled out as of a <I>s</I>&acirc;kvara (potent) nature, and are supposed to form the three stotriy&acirc; verses of the s&acirc;kvara-s&acirc;man, consisting of seven, six, and five p&acirc;das respectively. The a<I>s</I>&acirc;kvara p&acirc;das are, however, likewise chanted in their respective places, as is also the additional tenth verse, the five p&acirc;das of which are treated as mere supplementary (or 'filling in') matter.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_19"></A><A HREF="sbe4102.htm#fr_19">xxi:1</A> That is, the V&acirc;ravant&icirc;ya-tune adapted to the 'Revat&icirc;' verses. The V&acirc;ravant&icirc;ya-tune is named after its original text, Rig-veda I, 27, 1, 'a<I>s</I>va<I>m</I> na tv&acirc; v&acirc;ravantam' (S&acirc;ma-veda, ed. Bibl. Ind. I, p. 121). When used as one of the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-s&acirc;mans it is not, however, this, its original text, that is chanted to it, but the verses Rig-veda I, 30, 13-15, 'revat&icirc;r na<I>h</I> sadham&acirc;da' (S&acirc;ma-veda II, 434-6, ed. vol. iv, p. 56), whence the tune, as adapted to this, triplet, is usually called Raivata. The Raivata-s&acirc;man, thus, is a signal instance of the use of the term 's&acirc;man' in the sense of a chanted verse or triplet.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_20"></A><A HREF="sbe4102.htm#fr_20">xxi:2</A> The statement, in part ii, p. 403 note (and repeated in the present part, <A HREF="sbe4104.htm#page_6">p. 6</A>, note <A HREF="sbe4104.htm#fn_37">2</A>), that, while the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotras of the Abhiplava-sha<I>d</I>aha are performed in the ordinary (Agnish<I>t</I>oma) way, the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya-sha<I>d</I>aha requires their performance in the proper P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a form, is not correct. In both kinds of sha<I>d</I>aha, the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotras are performed in the ordinary way (viz. in the Agnish<I>t</I>oma or Ukthya way, see <A HREF="sbe4103.htm#page_4">p. 4</A> note); but whilst, in the Abhiplava, the Rathantara and B<I>ri</I>hat s&acirc;mans are used for the Hot<I>ri</I>'s P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra on alternate days, the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya-sha<I>d</I>aha requires a different P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-s&acirc;man on each of the six days. The two kinds of sha<I>d</I>ahas also differ entirely in regard to the sequence of stomas prescribed for the performance of the stotras.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_21"></A><A HREF="sbe4102.htm#fr_21">xxii:1</A> Either the Rathantara or the B<I>ri</I>hat also forms the 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a,' or enclosing s&acirc;man, of the fist P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_22"></A><A HREF="sbe4102.htm#fr_22">xxii:2</A> Whenever the stotra is not performed in the 'p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a' form, but consists of a single s&acirc;man or triplet, the repetitions required to make up the number of verses implied in the respective stoma, are distributed over the three verses of the s&acirc;man in such a way that the whole s&acirc;man is chanted thrice, each time with various repetitions of the single verses. The usual form in which the <A NAME="page_xxiii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxiii</FONT></A> ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a is performed may be represented by the formula aaa-bbb-c; a-bbb-ccc; aaa-b-ccc, making together twenty-one verses.</P>
