### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:1">6:3:3:1</span></span>1. Those
fires have been kindled (afresh); and they (the priests and sacrificer)
betake themselves to the lump of clay <span
id="fr_420"></span>[1](#fn_420.md);--those fires doubtless are these
worlds: when they are kindled, then they are these worlds. For formerly
the gods were seeking this sacred rite outside of these worlds; and when
he fetches the lump of clay after passing by those fires, he is seeking
him (Agni) outside of these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:2">6:3:3:2</span></span>2. They
go eastwards; for the east is Agni's region: he thus seeks him in his
own region, finds him in his own region.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:3">6:3:3:3</span></span>3. They
go forward, with, 'Aṅgiras-like, we go to Agni Purîshya;'--that is,
'like Agni, we are going to Agni, favourable to cattle.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:4">6:3:3:4</span></span>4. He
then looks at the sham-man, with, 'Aṅgiras-like, we shall carry Agni
Purîshya;'--that is, 'Like Agni, we shall carry Agni, favourable to
cattle:' he thus searches for him by means of the sham-man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:5">6:3:3:5</span></span>5.
Thereupon a hollow ant-hill is laid down midways (between the lump of
clay and the Âhavanîya fire). He looks along it <span
id="fr_421"></span>[2](#fn_421.md); for the ant-hill is this

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

earth, and this earth is these worlds. For the gods searched for him
(Agni) in these worlds part by part; and in like manner does this one
now search for him in these worlds part by part.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:6">6:3:3:6</span></span>6.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 17\] 'Agni hath looked along the crest of the
Dawns,'--thereby they sought him in the dawns;--'along the days, he, the
first knower of beings,'--thereby they sought him in the days;--'and
oftentimes along the rays of the sun,'--thereby they sought him in the
rays of the sun;--'along the sky and the earth hast thou
spread;'--therewith they sought him in the sky and the earth, and found
him; and in like manner does this one thereby find him (Agni). When he
sees him from afar, he throws down that (ant-hill); and they go up to
the lump of clay.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:7">6:3:3:7</span></span>7. He
then addresses the horse; for the gods then said, 'Let us drive away his
evil!' Now evil is weariness: thus, 'Let us drive away his weariness,
the evil!' They drove away his weariness, the evil; and in like manner
does this one now drive away his weariness, the evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:8">6:3:3:8</span></span>8.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 18\] 'The courser, having started on his way,'--for his
way has indeed been started upon;--'shaketh off all assaults,'--assaults
mean evils: thus, 'shakes off all evils;' and hence, indeed, the horse,
whilst running, shakes itself;--'Agni he seeks to descry with his eye on
the great seat;'--the great seat doubtless is this sacrificial (place):
thus, 'Agni he wishes to see with his eye on this great seat.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:9">6:3:3:9</span></span>9. He
then makes it (the horse) step on (the lump of clay with the left
fore-foot); for having discovered him (Agni), it (the horse) then
indicated

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

him to the gods, as if (it meant to say) <span
id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_422.md), 'Just here he is!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:10">6:3:3:10</span></span>10.
And, again, why he makes it step thereon;--the gods then were afraid,
thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not slay here this our
(Agni)!' They placed that thunderbolt upon him as a protector, to wit,
yonder sun; for that horse is indeed yonder sun; and in like manner does
this (Sacrificer, or priest) now place upon him that thunderbolt as a
protector.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:11">6:3:3:11</span></span>11.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 19\] 'Having come upon the earth, O courser, seek thou
Agni by thy light!'--the light is the eye: thus, 'Having come to the
earth, thou, O courser, seek Agni with thy eye!'--'by pawing <span
id="fr_423"></span>[2](#fn_423.md) the ground tell us where we may dig him
out!'--that is, 'by pointing out that (spot) of the ground tell us where
we may dig him out.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:12">6:3:3:12</span></span>12. He
then pulls it up <span id="fr_424"></span>[3](#fn_424.md); for the gods now
endowed it with vigour (for) having indicated (Agni) to them; and in
like manner does this one now endow it with vigour (for) having
indicated (Agni) to him. He does so, with \[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 20\], 'The sky
is thy back, the earth thy resting-place, the air thy body, the sea thy
womb;'--whereby he says, 'Such

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

thou art, such thou art;'--'Looking about with thine eye, tread down the
assailers!'--that is, 'Looking about with thy eye, tread down all
evildoers!' He does not touch it, lest this thunderbolt should injure
him, for the horse is a thunderbolt <span
id="fr_425"></span>[1](#fn_425.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:13">6:3:3:13</span></span>13. He
then makes it step off (the lump of clay);--for the gods now said, 'What
shall we cause it to obtain <span
id="fr_426"></span>[2](#fn_426.md)?'--'Great beauty <span
id="fr_427"></span>[3](#fn_427.md)!'--They caused it to obtain great
beauty; and in like manner does this one now cause it to obtain great
beauty,--with (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 21), 'Go thou unto great beauty!'--that is,
'Go to thy great beauty!' and therefore, indeed, the horse is the most
highly-favoured of animals;--'from this standing-place,'--that is,
'where thou now standest;'--'wealth-giver!'--for wealth it does give
them;--'Courser!'--for this is a courser;--'May we be in the Earth's
favour, whilst Agni we dig in her lap!'--that is, 'May we be in the
favour of this earth, whilst digging (for) Agni in her lap!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:14">6:3:3:14</span></span>14.
When it has stepped off he addresses it;--for as one would extol him who
has given a gift, so the gods now praised and magnified it (for) having
indicated (Agni); and in like manner does this one now praise and
magnify it, with (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 22), 'He hath come down,'--for it has
indeed come down,--'the wealth-giver,'--for wealth, indeed, is given
them; 'the racing courser,'--for it is indeed a racer and a
courser;--'hath made good, well-made room on earth,'--that is, 'thou
madest good, well-made room on earth;'--'thence let us

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

dig out the fair-looking Agni,'--'fair-looking,' he says, for Agni is
indeed fair-looking on every side;--'ascending the heaven, unto the
highest sky,'--the sky is the heavenly world: thus, 'mounting the
heavenly world, unto the highest sky.' He makes it come up on the right
side (of the lump) to where the two other beasts are: they stand on the
right side, facing the east. The significance of the right-hand
(southern) position here is the same as it was on that former occasion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:15">6:3:3:15</span></span>15.
Sitting down he now offers upon the lump of clay;--for the gods then
said, 'Meditate ye (*k*etay),' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say,
'Seek ye a layer (*k*iti)!' Whilst meditating they saw this libation,
and offered it: after offering it, they saw the fire-pan (representing)
these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:16">6:3:3:16</span></span>16.
They said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek
ye a layer!' Whilst meditating they saw this second libation, and
offered it: after offering it, they saw the Vi*s*va*g*yotis (all-light
bricks), that is, those deities Agni, Vâyu, and Âditya; for these
deities are indeed all the light. And in like manner does the Sacrificer
now, after offering those two libations, see the fire-pan, these worlds;
and those all-light deities. He offers with two interlinked
(verses) <span id="fr_428"></span>[1](#fn_428.md): he thereby interlinks
these worlds, and those deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:17">6:3:3:17</span></span>17.
And, again, why he offers these two libations;--he thereby gratifies
both the clay and the water; and having offered to, and gratified, these
two, he then brings them together. With two interlinked

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (verses) he
offers: he thereby interlinks (combines thoroughly) the clay and the
water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:18">6:3:3:18</span></span>18. He
offers with ghee; for the ghee is a thunderbolt: he thus makes the
thunderbolt its (or his, Agni's) protector. The ghee, moreover, is seed:
he thus pours forth seed,--with the sruva-spoon; for the sruva (m.) is a
male, and the male pours forth seed,--with 'Svâhâ (hail!),' for the
Svâhâkâra (m.) is a male, and the male pours forth seed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:19">6:3:3:19</span></span>19.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 23 <span id="fr_429"></span>[1](#fn_429.md)\] 'Upon thee I
sprinkle with thought, with ghee,'--that is, 'upon thee I offer with
thought and ghee;'--'that dwellest near all beings,'--for he (Agni)
indeed comes to dwell near every being;--'thee, large and great with
side-spent force,'--for large he is, and directed sideways, and great
with force, with smoke;--'most ample through food, and fierce to look
at,'--that is, 'capacious with food, a consumer of food, and flaming.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:20">6:3:3:20</span></span>20.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 24\] 'From all sides I sprinkle the hitherward
looking,'--that is, 'from every side I offer upon the hitherward
looking;'--'with spiteless mind let him relish this,'--that is, 'with
unchafing mind may he relish this;'--'Agni, glorious as a wooer, and of
pleasing colour,'--for Agni is indeed glorious as a wooer <span
id="fr_430"></span>[2](#fn_430.md) and of pleasing colour;--'not to be
touched, while raging with his body,'--for not to be touched is he,
whilst flaming with his body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:21">6:3:3:21</span></span>21.
With two (verses) he offers; for the Sacrificer

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

is two-footed, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great
as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed;--with two
(verses) relating to Agni: it is Agni he thereby pours forth as seed.
Inasmuch as they relate to Agni, they are Agni; and inasmuch as they are
Trish*t*ubhs, they are Indra; and Agni (the fire) belongs to Indra and
Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he
thus pours him forth as seed. Moreover, Indra and Agni are all the gods,
and Agni (thus) contains all deities: as great as Agni is, as great as
is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:22">6:3:3:22</span></span>22. He
offers on the horse's footprint;--the horse is the same as that Agni,
and so, indeed, these two libations come to be offered over Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:23">6:3:3:23</span></span>23. He
draws lines around it (the lump, with the spade): he thereby puts a
measure to it (or, to him, Agni), as if saying, 'So great thou art!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:24">6:3:3:24</span></span>24.
And, again, why he draws a line around it;--the gods now were afraid,
thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite here this
(Agni) of ours!' They drew that rampart round it; and in like manner
does this one now draw that rampart round it,--with the spade, for the
spade is the thunderbolt, and he thus makes the thunderbolt its (or his,
Agni's) protector. He draws it all round: on every side he thus makes
that thunderbolt to be its (or his) protector <span
id="fr_431"></span>[1](#fn_431.md). Three times he draws a line: that
threefold thunderbolt he thus makes to be a protector for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:25">6:3:3:25</span></span>25.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 25-27\] 'Around the wise lord

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

of strength-- <span id="fr_432"></span>[1](#fn_432),' 'Around (us.md) we
(place) thee, O Agni, as a rampart-- <span
id="fr_433"></span>[2](#fn_433.md),' 'With the days, thou Agni-- <span
id="fr_434"></span>[3](#fn_434.md),' in thus praising Agni he makes a fence
for him by means of (verses) containing the word 'pari' (around), for
all round, as it were, (run) the ramparts;--(he does so by verses)
relating to Agni: a stronghold of fire he thus makes for him, and this
stronghold of fire keeps blazing;--(he does so) by three (verses): a
threefold stronghold he thus makes for him; and hence that threefold
stronghold is the highest form of strongholds. Each following (circular)
line he makes wider, and with a larger metre: hence each following line
of strongholds is wider, for strongholds (ramparts) are lines.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:3:3:26">6:3:3:26</span></span>26. He
then digs for him (Agni) <span id="fr_435"></span>[4](#fn_435.md) in this
earth. For the gods then were afraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas,
the fiends, will not smite him here <span
id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_432.md)! For the sake of protection they made
this earth to be a self (body, âtman) for him, thinking, 'His own self
will protect his own self.' It (the lump of clay) should be as large as
the hole: thus this earth (or clay) becomes his (Agni's) self. And as to
its (being) as large as the hole,--this earth is the womb, and this
(clay) is teed; and whatever part of the seed

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

exceeds the womb, becomes useless; and what is deficient, is
unsuccessful; but that part of the seed which is within the hole is
successful. Four-cornered is this hole, for there are four quarters:
from all the (four) quarters he thus digs him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_420"></span>[206:1](sbe4136.htm#fr_420.md) The lump of clay
which is to be used for the making of the fire-pan has been placed in a
square hole east of the Âhavanîya fire.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[206:2](sbe4136.htm#fr_421.md) That is to say, he
looks at the lump of clay through the hollow part of the ant-hill,
whilst muttering the formula given in the next paragraph.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[208:1](sbe4136.htm#fr_422.md) Or, as if one were
to say,--yathâyam iha-sthâna âstha(?) iti ka*sk*id brûyâd eva*m*
proktavân, Sây.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[208:2](sbe4136.htm#fr_423.md) Or, by
covering;--it is not easy to see what the author makes of 'v*ri*ttvâya,'
for which the St. Petersburg dictionary suggests 'v*ri*tvâya.' Mahîdhara
derives it from 'vart,' in the sense of 'to touch.' Perhaps, however,
'bhûmer' depends on 'yatas;' hence 'moving about, tell us from what spot
of the ground we may dig him out.'

<span id="fn_424"></span>[208:3](sbe4136.htm#fr_424.md) That is, he pulls
up its head (?); 'he rouses it, shakes it up,' St. Petersb.
Dict.--Sâya*n*a, on the other hand, in accordance with Kâty. XVI, 2, 18,
interprets 'unm*ris*ati' by 'he holds his hand over its
back,'--p*ri*sh*th*asyopari pâ*n*i*m* dhârayati.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[209:1](sbe4136.htm#fr_425.md) For the
construction, see on [paragraph 6](sbe4136.htm#6:3:3:6.md), [p.
205](sbe4135.htm#page_205), note \*[1](sbe4135.htm#fn_419.md)\*.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[209:2](sbe4136.htm#fr_426.md) Literally, to step
off to.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[209:3](sbe4136.htm#fr_427.md) Saubhaga, 'the
state of being well-endowed, well-favoured.'

<span id="fn_428"></span>[210:1](sbe4136.htm#fr_428.md) The two halves of
the two verses (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 23, 24) are uttered in the order 1 a, 2 b,
2 a, 1 b.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[211:1](sbe4136.htm#fr_429.md) *Ri*k S. II, 50, 4,
beginning, however, 'I sprinkle Agni with a ghee-oblation.'

<span id="fn_430"></span>[211:2](sbe4136.htm#fr_430.md) Mahîdhara and
Sâya*n*a (*Ri*k S. II, 10, 5) take 'marya*s*rî' in the sense of
'resorted to, or worshipped, by men.'

<span id="fn_431"></span>[212:1](sbe4136.htm#fr_431.md) Or, he makes that
protecting thunderbolt for it (or him).

<span id="fn_432"></span>[213:1](sbe4136.htm#fr_436.md) Vâ*g*. S. XI, 25;
*Ri*k S. IV, 15, 3, 'Around the offering, Agni, the wise lord of
strength, hath come, bestowing precious gifts upon the worshipper.'

<span id="fn_433"></span>[213:2](sbe4136.htm#fr_433.md) Vâ*g*. S. XI, 26;
*Ri*k S. X, 87, 22, 'Around we place thee, the priest, as a rampart, O
mighty Agni, the bold-raced slayer of the wily day by day.'

<span id="fn_434"></span>[213:3](sbe4136.htm#fr_434.md) Vâ*g*. S. XI, 27;
*Ri*k S. II, 1, 1, 'With the days, O Agni, thou, longing to shine
hither, art born forth from the waters, out of the shore, from the
woods, from the herbs, thou the bright, O man-lord of men.'

<span id="fn_435"></span>[213:4](sbe4136.htm#fr_435.md) Or he digs out that
(lump of clay).
