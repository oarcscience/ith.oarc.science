He now digs that (hole)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_477"></A><A HREF="#fn_475"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in the earth; for the gods now were afraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite here this (Agni) of</p>

He digs him out with (the help of) Aditi, in order to guard him from injury; for Aditi is this earth, and one does not injure one's own self; but were he to dig with (the help of) another deity, he surely would injure him (Agni).</p>

This hole is four-cornered, for there are four quarters: he thus digs it from all the quarters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_478"></A><A HREF="#fn_476"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Having then laid down fuel in it, he silently puts the 'invincible' (brick) thereon, for that is made first.</p>

He then sets down the fire-pan (with the bottom part upwards), with, 'May the divine wives of the gods, dear to all the gods, place thee, A&#7749;giras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine wives of the gods, dear to all the gods, indeed, like A&#7749;giras, placed that (fire-pan) into the lap of the earth, and by (the help of) them he now places it. But, surely, these are the plants,--the wives of the gods are indeed the plants; for by the plants everything here is supported: by means of the plants he thus supports this (fire-pan). He then lays down silently the all-light' (bricks). Having then placed fuel thereon he kindles it.</p>

But, surely, this is V&acirc;<I>k</I> (speech),--the Dhisha<I>n</I>&acirc;s are indeed speech&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_479"></A><A HREF="#fn_477"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for by speech everything is kindled here: by means of speech he thus kindles this (fire-pan). Whilst looking at it, he then mutters these three formulas:</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:5:4:6">6:5:4:6</A></FONT></span>6. 'May the divine protectresses, dear to all the gods, heat thee, O fire-pan, A&#7749;giras-like, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine protectresses, dear to all the gods, indeed, like A&#7749;giras, heated it in the lap of the earth; and by them he now heats it. But, surely, these are the days and nights,--the protectresses are indeed the days and nights; for by days and nights everything is covered here: by means of the days and nights he thus heats it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:5:4:7">6:5:4:7</A></FONT></span>7. 'May the divine ladies, dear to all the gods, bake thee, A&#7749;giras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine ladies, dear to all the gods, did, like A&#7749;giras, bake it in the lap of the earth, and with their help he now bakes it. But, surely, these are the metres,--the ladies (gn&acirc;) are indeed the metres (scripture texts), for by means of these men go (gam) to the celestial world: by means of the metres he thus bakes it.</p>

<p>of old the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, did bake it, like A&#7749;giras, in the lap of the earth; and with their help he now bakes it. But, surely, these are the stars,--the women (<I>g</I>ani) are indeed the stars, for these are the lights of those righteous men (<I>g</I>ana) who go to the celestial world: it is by means of the stars that he thus bakes it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:5:4:9">6:5:4:9</A></FONT></span>9. Now he digs with one (formula), he sets down (the fire-pan) with one, he kindles with one, he heats with one, he bakes (pa<I>k</I>) with two, whence twice in the year food is ripened (pa<I>k</I>); these amount to six,--six seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:5:4:10">6:5:4:10</A></FONT></span>10. And as often as he attends to (the fire by adding fresh fuel)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_480"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> he attends to it with the prayer relating to Mitra, '[The protection] of Mitra, the preserver of men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> . . .;' for a friend (mitra) does not injure any one, nor does any one injure his friend; and in like manner does this one not injure that (fire-pan), nor does it (injure) him. By day he should put (fuel) on it, by day he should clear it (of the ashes).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:5:4:11">6:5:4:11</A></FONT></span>11. He clears it (of the ashes) with a prayer relating to Savit<I>ri</I>,--for Savit<I>ri</I> is the impeller: impelled</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_245"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 245</FONT></A></p>  
<p>by Savit<I>ri</I>, he thus clears it--[V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XI, 63] 'May the divine Savit<I>ri</I>, the well-handed, well-fingered, and well-armed, clear thee by his might!'--for Savit<I>ri</I> is all that.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:5:4:12">6:5:4:12</A></FONT></span>12. He then turns it (the fire-pan) round, with. 'Not tottering upon the earth, fill the regions, the quarters!'--that is, 'not tottering, fill thou with sap the regions and quarters on earth!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:5:4:13">6:5:4:13</A></FONT></span>13. He then takes it up, with [V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XI, 641 'Having risen, do thou become great,'--for these worlds, having risen, are great;--'and stand up steadfast!' that is, 'stand thou up firm and fixed!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:5:4:14">6:5:4:14</A></FONT></span>14. Having taken it in both hands, he sets it down, with, 'O Mitra, unto thee I consign this fire-pan for safety: may it not break!' for Mitra is that wind which blows yonder: it is to him he thus consigns it for .protection; for these worlds are protected by Mitra (or by a friend), whence nothing whatever is harmed in these worlds.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:5:4:15">6:5:4:15</A></FONT></span>15. He then pours (milk) into it,--just for strength, or to (mark) the progress of the work. And, again, why he pours (milk) into it,--that fire-pan is the head of the sacrifice, and milk is breath: he thus lays breath into the head. Moreover, the fire-pan (ukh&acirc;, f.) is a female: he thus lays milk into the female, whence there is milk in the female.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:5:4:16">6:5:4:16</A></FONT></span>16. He pours goat's milk into it to avoid injury&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_480"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for the goat sprang from Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's head, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is Agni; and one does not injure one's own self. And as to why it is goat's (milk),--the goat eats all (kinds of) herbs: he thus pours into it (the pan) the sap of all (kinds of) herbs.</p>

XI, 65] 'May the Vasus fill thee with the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; metre, A&#7749;giras-like!--May the Rudras fill thee with the Trish<I>t</I>ubh metre, A&#7749;giras-like!--May the &Acirc;dityas fill thee with the <I>G</I>agat&icirc; metre, A&#7749;giras-like!--May the All-gods, dear to all men, fill thee with the Anush<I>t</I>ubh metre, A&#7749;giras-like!'--by these deities he thus moistens it: by whatever deities he fashions it, by them he fumigates it, and by them he moistens it. For he who performs a work, knows the practice of it: hence by whatever deities he fashions it, by them he fumigates and moistens it.</p>
