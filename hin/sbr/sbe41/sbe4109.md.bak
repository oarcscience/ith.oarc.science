### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:1">5:2:2:1</span></span>1. He now
proceeds with the Bârhaspatya pap. Its svish*t*ak*ri*t remains yet
unoffered, when he (the Adhvaryu) brings <span
id="fr_86"></span>[2](#fn_86) him (the Sacrificer.md) some food; for he who
offers the Vâ*g*apeya wins food, vâ*g*apeya being the same as anna-peya:
thus whatever food he (the Sacrificer) has thereby gained, that he (the
Adhvaryu) now brings to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:2">5:2:2:2</span></span>2. In a
vessel of udumbara wood--the Udumbara tree being sustenance, (that is)
food--for the obtainment of sustenance, food: therefore it is in a
vessel of udumbara wood. He first brings water, then milk, then (other)
kinds of food, as they occur to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:3">5:2:2:3</span></span>3. Now
some bring seventeen kinds of food,

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

saying, 'Seventeenfold is Pra*g*âpati.' But let him not do so: surely
all the food is not appropriated to Pra*g*âpati <span
id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87.md), and, compared to him, what is man that he
should appropriate to himself all food? Hence, while bringing every kind
of food that occurs to him, let him not bring of some one (particular)
kind of food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:4">5:2:2:4</span></span>4. And
whatever food he does trot bring to him, let him (the Sacrificer)
forswear <span id="fr_88"></span>[2](#fn_88.md) that, and not eat of it as
long as he lives: thus he does not go to the end, thus he lives long. Of
all that food brought together he offers the (seven)
Vâ*g*a-prasavanîya <span id="fr_89"></span>[3](#fn_89.md) oblations,
cutting out (pieces) with the dipping-spoon. Thus to whatever deities he
is now offering, they give an impulse to him, and impelled by them he

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

wins: therefore he offers the Vâ*g*aprasavanîya oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:5">5:2:2:5</span></span>5. He
offers with (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 23-29), 'The impulse of strength impelled of
old that king Soma in the plants, in the waters: may they be rich in
honey for us! may we be wakeful in the kingdom, placed in the front,
hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:6">5:2:2:6</span></span>6. 'The
impulse of strength spread over this sky, and over all these worlds, as
the all-ruler; knowing he causeth him to give gifts who wisheth not to
give: may he bestow upon us wealth with the full muster of heroes,
hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:7">5:2:2:7</span></span>7. 'Yea,
the impulse of strength prevailed over all these worlds, on every side;
from days of yore the king goeth about knowing, increasing the people,
and the well-being amongst us, hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:8">5:2:2:8</span></span>8. 'To
king Soma, to Agni we cling <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md) for
help, to the Âdityas, to Vish*n*u, to Sûrya, to the Brahman
B*ri*haspati, hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:9">5:2:2:9</span></span>9. 'Urge
thou Aryaman, B*ri*haspati, Indra to the giving of gifts, Vâ*k* <span
id="fr_91"></span>[2](#fn_91.md), Vish*n*u, Sarasvatî, and the vigorous
Savit*ri*, hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:10">5:2:2:10</span></span>10. 'O
Agni, speak to us here, be thou gracious unto us! bestow blessings upon
us, O winner of thousands, for thou art the giver of wealth, hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:11">5:2:2:11</span></span>11.
'May Aryaman bestow blessings upon us, and Pûshan, and B*ri*haspati! may
the divine Vâ*k* give us gifts, hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:12">5:2:2:12</span></span>12.
With the remaining (offering material) he sprinkles him (the
Sacrificer); he thereby sprinkles

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

him with food, bestows food upon him: for this reason he sprinkles him
with the remaining (material) <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:13">5:2:2:13</span></span>13. He
sprinkles with (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 30), 'At the impulse of the divine
Savit*ri*, (I sprinkle) thee, by the arms of the A*s*vins, by the hands
of Pûshan!' he thus sprinkles (consecrates) him by the hands of
gods;--'I place thee in the leading of Sarasvatî Vâ*k*, the leader;' for
Sarasvatî is Vâ*k* (speech): he thus places him in the leading of Vâ*k*,
the leader.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:14">5:2:2:14</span></span>14.
Here now some say, 'I place thee in the leading of the leader of all the
gods;' for all the gods are the All: he thus places him in the leading
of the leader of the All. But let him not say so; let him rather say, 'I
place thee in the leading of Sarasvatî Vâ*k*;' for Sarasvatî is Vâ*k*:
he thus places him in the leading of Vâ*k*.--'I consecrate thee, N.N.,
with the supreme rulership of B*ri*haspati!' therewith he mentions the
(Sacrificer's) name: he thus makes him attain to the fellowship of
B*ri*haspati, and to co-existence in his world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:15">5:2:2:15</span></span>15. He
then says,' All-ruler is he, N.N.! All-ruler is he, N.N.!' Him, thus
indicated, he thereby indicates to the gods: 'Of mighty power is he who
has been consecrated; he has become one of yours; protect him!' thus he
thereby says. Thrice he says it, for threefold is the sacrifice.

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:16">5:2:2:16</span></span>16. He
then either offers, or makes him pronounce (the formulas of) the
U*gg*iti oblations <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md). Whether he
offers or makes him pronounce (the formulas), the significance is the
same.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:17">5:2:2:17</span></span>17. He
makes him say (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 31-34), 'With the (word of) one syllable
Agni won the breath: may I win that!-- -- <span
id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_94) With the (metre of.md) seventeen syllables
Pra*g*âpati won the seventeenfold stoma: may I win that!' whatever those
deities won by means of those (formulas), that he now wins by them.
There are seventeen (formulas), for Pra*g*âpati is seventeenfold: he
thus wins Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:18">5:2:2:18</span></span>18.
Thereupon he says, 'Recite (the invitatory formula) to Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t!' Now, as to why this rite is performed between two
oblations. Pra*g*âpati, truly, is that sacrifice which is here
performed, and from which these creatures have been produced,--and,
indeed, they are even now produced after this one: he thus wins
Pra*g*âpati in the very middle: therefore that rite is performed between
two oblations. Having made (the Âgnîdhra) utter the

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *S*rausha*t*, he
says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t!' and
offers as the Vasha*t* is uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:19">5:2:2:19</span></span>19. He
then puts the I*d*â on (the i*d*âpâtrî). The I*d*â having been
invoked <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md), he, having touched water,
draws the Mâhendra cup. Having drawn the Mâhendra cup, he sets the chant
agoing <span id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_96.md). He urges him (the
Sacrificer) forward to the chant: he gets down (from the throne-seat);
he is in attendance at the Stotra, in attendance at the *S*astra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:20">5:2:2:20</span></span>20.
Here now some, having performed that, perform that <span
id="fr_97"></span>[3](#fn_97.md); but let him not do it thus; for the
Stotra is his (the Sacrificer's) own self, and the *S*astra is his
people (or [offspring](errata.htm#7).md): thereby then he ruins the
Sacrificer; he goes astray, he stumbles;--hence having performed that,
let him perform that:--

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:2:2:21">5:2:2:21</span></span>21. He
puts the I*d*â on (the dish). The I*d*â having been invoked, he, having
touched water, draws the Mâhendra cup. Having drawn the Mâhendra cup, he
sets the (P*ri*sh*th*a-) Stotra agoing. He urges him (the Sacrificer)
forward to the chant: he gets down (from the throne-seat); he is in
attendance at the chant (stotra), in attendance at the recitation
(*s*astra).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_86"></span>[36:2](sbe4109.htm#fr_86.md) He collects
(sambharati), or provides food for him; this ceremony corresponding to
that of equipping or provisioning the sacred fire with the so-called
sambharas, at the Agny-âdhâna; see II, 1, 1, 1 seq.; part i, p. 276,
note 1.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[37:1](sbe4109.htm#fr_87.md) Or 'from Pra*g*âpati;'
or perhaps, 'surely not all Pra*g*âpati's food is appropriated.' The
Kâ*n*va recension reads thus, [VI, 2, 3, 3](sbe4133.htm#6:2:3:3.md). He
first brings water, then milk, then, as they occur to him (other) kinds
of food. 'Let him bring those seventeen kinds of food,' they say, for
Pra*g*âpati is seventeenfold.' Nevertheless (tadu) let him bring
whatever kinds of food he can either think of or obtain. 4. Of this his
food that has been brought together, let him set aside (uddharet) one
(particular kind of) food: let him forswear that (tad udbruvîta), and
not eat of it as long as he lives (yâva*g* *g*îvet). By that much also
(or, even so long, tâvad api vai prâ*g*apate*h* sarvam annam
anavaruddham) all the food of Pra*g*âpati is not appropriated; and who
is man (compared) to him, that he should appropriate to himself all
food? Thus he does not go to the end, thus he lives long: that (food) is
here left over for his offspring (or people).

<span id="fn_88"></span>[37:2](sbe4109.htm#fr_88.md) Sâya*n*a explains
'tasya udbruvîta' by,--one ought to proclaim it, saying aloud 'such and
such food has not been brought;'--na sambh*ri*tam ity u*kk*ais tannâma
brûyât.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[37:3](sbe4109.htm#fr_89.md) That is, oblations
calculated to promote or quicken (pra-su) the strength (food,--vâ*g*a)
by their prayers, the first three of which begin with 'vâ*g*asya . . .
prasava*h*.' See [p. 2](sbe4103.htm#page_2.md), note
[1](sbe4103.htm#fn_32.md). In the Black Ya*g*us ritual these oblations are
called 'Annahomâ*h*' or food-oblations. Taitt. Br. I, 3, 8, 1. The
Sûtras seem, however, likewise to use the term 'Vâ*g*aprasavanîya' (or
Vâ*g*aprasavîya).

<span id="fn_90"></span>[38:1](sbe4109.htm#fr_90.md) Rig-veda X, 141, 3
reads,--King Soma, Agni we invoke with our voices, the Âdityas, &c.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[38:2](sbe4109.htm#fr_91.md) Rig-veda X, 141, 5 has
Vâta (Wind) instead of Vâ*k* (Speech).

<span id="fn_92"></span>[39:1](sbe4109.htm#fr_92.md) According to the
Taittirîyas (Taitt. S., vol. i, p. 1049), the Sacrificer is made to sit
on the black antelope skin, with his face to the east, with a small gold
and silver plate placed on either side of him; and he is then sprinkled
in front, on the head, so that the liquid runs down to his mouth, thus
symbolizing the entering of food and strength into him.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[40:1](sbe4109.htm#fr_93.md) That is, oblations of
'victory,' with the formulas used therewith, containing each two forms
of the verb ud-*g*i, 'to conquer.'

<span id="fn_94"></span>[40:2](sbe4109.htm#fr_94.md) The intervening
formulas here understood, and given in the Vâ*g*. Sa*m*hitâ, are to the
effect that the A*s*vins, by two syllables, gained the two-footed men;
Vish*n*u, by three, the three worlds; Soma, by four, the four-footed
cattle; Pûshan, by five, the five regions (the four quarters and the
upper region); Savit*ri*, by six, the six seasons; the Maruts, by seven,
the seven kinds of domestic animals; B*ri*haspati, by eight, the Gâyatrî
metre; Mitra, by nine, the Triv*ri*t stoma (hymn-tune); Varu*n*a, by
ten, the Virâ*g* metre; Indra, by eleven, the Trish*t*ubh metre; the
All-gods, by twelve, the *G*agatî metre; the Vasus, by thirteen, the
thirteenfold stoma; the Rudras, by fourteen, the fourteenfold stoma; the
Âdityas, by fifteen, the fifteenfold stoma; Aditi, by sixteen, the
sixteenfold stoma.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[41:1](sbe4109.htm#fr_95.md) See I, 8, 1, 18 seq.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[41:2](sbe4109.htm#fr_96.md) That is, the (first or
Hot*ri*'s) P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra, for which see above, [p.
15](sbe4105.htm#page_15), note [1](sbe4105.htm#fn_55.md); part ii, p. 339,
note 2. Its chanting is followed by the Nishkevalya-*s*astra, recited by
the Hot*ri*.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[41:3](sbe4109.htm#fr_97.md) That is to say,
according to Sâya*n*a,--they make the Svish*t*ak*ri*t, and the rising of
the Sacrificer from the throne-seat, take place after the pronunciation
of the 'u*gg*iti' formulas, the drawing of the Mâhendra cup, and the
performance of the Stotra and *S*astra.
