### FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:1:1">6:4:1:1</span></span>1. He now
digs it (the lump of clay) <span id="fr_437"></span>[1](#fn_436.md) up from
that (hole);--for the gods, having found him (Agni), then dug him up;
and in like manner this one, after finding him, now digs him up,--with
(Vâ*g*. S. XI, 28), 'At the impulse of the god Savit*ri*, by the arms of
the A*s*vins, by the hands of Pûshan, I dig thee, the Agni Purîshya,
from the lap of the earth, Aṅgiras-like;'--impelled by Savit*ri*, he
thus, by means of those deities, digs him up, the Agni favourable to
cattle, as Agni (did).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:1:2">6:4:1:2</span></span>2. 'Thee,
O Agni, the bright, the fair-faced,'--for this Agni is indeed bright and
fair-faced;--'glowing with perpetual sheen,'--that is, 'shining with
perpetual light;'--'thee, kind to creatures, and never harming, the Agni
Purîshya we dig up from the lap of the earth, Aṅgiras-like;'--that is,
thee, kind to creatures, and never harming, the cattle-loving Agni we
dig up from the lap of the earth, as Agni (did).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:1:3">6:4:1:3</span></span>3. With
two (formulas) he digs,--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the
Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,
with so much he thus digs him up. And twofold also is that form of his,
(consisting as it does of) clay and water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:1:4">6:4:1:4</span></span>4. He
digs, with, 'I dig,'--'we dig;' for with, 'I

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

dig,' Pra*g*âpati dug for him (Agni); and with, 'we dig,' the gods dug
for him, therefore (he digs), with, 'I dig,'--'we dig.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:1:5">6:4:1:5</span></span>5. Now
while digging with the spade, he says with speech 'I dig,' 'we dig,' for
the spade is speech. It is for his undertaking that this bamboo (spade)
is made; and with speech for a spade, the gods dug him up; and in like
manner does this one now dig him up with speech for a spade (or, with
the speech-spade).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:1:6">6:4:1:6</span></span>6. He
then deposits it upon the black antelope skin, for the black antelope
skin is the sacrifice <span id="fr_438"></span>[1](#fn_437.md): in the
sacrifice he thus deposits it (or him, Agni);--on the hair (side); for
the hair is the metres: he thus deposits him on the metres. That (skin)
he spreads silently; for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice; and
the sacrifice is Pra*g*âpati, and undefined is Pra*g*âpati. North (of
the hole he spreads it),--the meaning of this (will be explained)
hereafter;--on (the skin spread) with the neck-part in front, for thus
(it is turned) towards the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:1:7">6:4:1:7</span></span>7. And he
deposits it on a lotus-leaf (placed on the skin); for the lotus-leaf is
the womb, and into the womb he pours that seed; and the seed which is
poured into the womb, becomes generative. He spreads that (leaf) with a
formula; for the formula is speech, and the lotus-leaf is speech <span
id="fr_439"></span>[2](#fn_438.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:1:8">6:4:1:8</span></span>8.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 29\] 'Thou art the waters’

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

back, Agni's womb,' for this is indeed the back of the waters, and the
womb of Agni;--'around the swelling sea,'--for the sea indeed swells
around it;--'thou, growing mighty upon the lotus,'--that is, 'growing,
prosper thou on the lotus.'--'With the measure of the sky, extend thou
in width!'--with this he strokes along it (so as to lie even on the
skin); for that Agni is yonder sun; and him assuredly none other than
the width of the sky can contain: 'having become the sky, contain him!'
this is what he thereby says.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:1:9">6:4:1:9</span></span>9. He
spreads it over the black antelope skin; for the black antelope skin is
the sacrifice; and the black antelope skin is this earth, and the
sacrifice is this earth, for on this earth the sacrifice is spread. And
the lotus-leaf is the sky; for the sky is the waters, and the lotus-leaf
is the waters; and yonder sky is above this earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:1:10">6:4:1:10</span></span>10. He
touches both of them--he thereby brings about concord between them--with
(Vâ*g*. S. XI, 30), 'A shelter ye are, a shield ye are!'--for both a
shelter and a shield these two indeed are;--'uninjured both, and
ample,'--for uninjured and ample both these indeed are;--'capacious,
guard ye,'--that is, 'spacious, guard ye!'--'bear ye Agni
Purîshya!'--that is, 'bear ye Agni, favourable to cattle <span
id="fr_440"></span>[1](#fn_439.md)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:1:11">6:4:1:11</span></span>11.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 31\] 'Guard ye, light-finders, uniting with each other,
with the breast, with the self,'--that is, 'guard him, ye light-finders,
uniting with each other, both with your breast and your self;'--'bearing
within the brilliant, the

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

everlasting;'--this Agni indeed is yonder sun, and he is the brilliant,
the everlasting one; and him these two bear between (them): hence he
says, the brilliant, the everlasting.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:4:1:12">6:4:1:12</span></span>12. He
touches them with two (verses);--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the
Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by
so much he thus brings about concord between these two. And, again, (he
does so) because that form of theirs is twofold, (there being) a black
antelope skin and a lotus-leaf.
