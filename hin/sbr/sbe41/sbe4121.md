### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:1">5:4:4:1</span></span>1. He
proceeds with the curds for Mitra-Varu*n*a. Whilst the Svish*t*ak*ri*t
of it remains yet unoffered, they bring a throne-seat for him (the
king); for truly he who gains a seat in the air, gains a seat above
(others): thus these subjects of his sit below him who is seated
above,--that is why they bring him a throne-seat. It is of khadira
(acacia catechu) wood, and perforated, and bound with thongs as that of
the Bhâratas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:2">5:4:4:2</span></span>2. He
places it (on the tiger's skin), in front of the Maitrâvaru*n*a's
hearth, with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 26), 'Thou art pleasant, thou art
soft-seated!'--he thereby renders it kindly and auspicious.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:3">5:4:4:3</span></span>3. He
then spreads a mantle over it, with, 'Thou art the womb (seat) of
knighthood!'--he thus

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

makes it (the king's throne) the very womb of knighthood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:4">5:4:4:4</span></span>4. He
then makes him sit down on it, with, 'Seat thee on the pleasant one!
seat thee on the soft-seated!'--whereby he says, 'Seat thyself on the
kindly and auspicious (seat)!'--'Seat thee in the womb of
knighthood!'--thus he places him in what is the very womb of knighthood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:5">5:4:4:5</span></span>5. Having
touched him on the chest, he then mutters (Vâ*g*. S. X, 27; *Ri*k S. I,
25, 10), 'He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law,'--the king
indeed is the upholder of the sacred law, for he is not capable of all
and every speech, nor of all and every deed; but that he should speak
only what is right, and do what is right, of that he, as well as the
*S*rotriya (the Brâhman versed in sacred writ), is capable; for these
two are the upholders of the sacred law among men: therefore he says,
'He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law;'--'Varu*n*a, in the
home-steads,'--the home-steads are the peasants (clans, people): 'among
the peasants' he means to say;--'for supreme rule, he the wise!'--'for
kingship' he means to say when he says, 'for supreme rule, he the wise.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:6">5:4:4:6</span></span>6. He
then throws the five dice <span id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_209) into his
hand,

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 28), 'Dominant thou art: may these five regions of
thine prosper!'--now that

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

one, the Kali, is indeed dominant over the (other) dice, for that one
dominates over all the dice: therefore he says, 'Dominant thou art: may
these five regions of thine prosper!' for there are indeed five regions,
and all the regions he thereby causes to prosper for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:7">5:4:4:7</span></span>7. They
(the Adhvaryu and his assistants) then silently strike him with sticks
on the back;--by beating him with sticks (da*nd*a) they guide him safely
over judicial punishment (da*nd*abadha): whence the king is exempt from
punishment (ada*nd*ya), because they guide him safely over judicial
punishment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:8">5:4:4:8</span></span>8.
Thereupon he chooses a boon; and, verily, whatsoever boon he who has
been anointed chooses, that is completely fulfilled for him: therefore
he chooses a boon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:9">5:4:4:9</span></span>9. 'O
Brahman!' thus he addresses (the priest) the first time <span
id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_210), thinking, 'I will first utter the
(word)

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brahman, I will
speak speech sped by the Brahman:' this is why he first addresses him
with 'O Brahman!' The other answers, 'Thou art Brahman! Thou art
Savit*ri* of true impulsion!'--he thereby lays vigour into him, and
causes Savit*ri* to be of true impulsion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:10">5:4:4:10</span></span>10. 'O
Brahman!' thus he addresses him the second time. The other answers,
'Thou art Brahman! Thou art Varu*n*a of true power!'--he thereby lays
vigour into him, and causes Varu*n*a to be of true power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:11">5:4:4:11</span></span>11. 'O
Brahman!' thus he addresses him the third time. The other answers, 'Thou
art Brahman! Thou art Indra, mighty through the people <span
id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_211)!'--he thereby lays vigour into him, and
causes Indra to be mighty through the people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:12">5:4:4:12</span></span>12. 'O
Brahman!' thus he addresses him the

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

fourth time. The other answers, 'Thou art Brahman! Thou art Rudra, the
most kindly!'--he thereby lays into him (the king) those former
energies, and he appeases him (Rudra); and he, Rudra, therefore, is
gracious to every one, because he (the priest) appeases him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:13">5:4:4:13</span></span>13. 'O
Brahman!' thus he addresses him the fifth time. The other answers
(undefinedly), 'Thou art Brahman!'--undefined means unlimited: thus
heretofore he laid limited vigour into him; but now he answers
undefinedly; and undefined meaning unlimited, he thereby lays complete,
unlimited vigour into him: therefore he answers here undefinedly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:14">5:4:4:14</span></span>14. He
then hails him as one bearing auspicious names,--'Much-worker,
better-worker, more-worker <span id="fr_212"></span>[1](#fn_212)!'
Whoever bears such names speaks auspiciously even with a human voice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:15">5:4:4:15</span></span>15. A
Brâhma*n*a then hands to him the sacrificial (wooden) sword,--either the
Adhvaryu, or he who is his (the king's) domestic chaplain--with,
'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!'--the sacrificial
sword being a thunderbolt, that Brâhma*n*a, by means of that
thunderbolt, makes the king to be weaker than himself; for indeed the
king who is weaker than a Brâhma*n*a, is stronger than his enemies: thus
he thereby makes him stronger than his enemies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:16">5:4:4:16</span></span>16. The
king hands it to the king's brother, with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou
art: therewith serve me!' Thereby the king makes his brother to be
weaker than himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:17">5:4:4:17</span></span>17. The
king's brother hands it either to the

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sûta (minstrel and
chronicler), or to the Governor, with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art:
therewith serve me!' Thereby the king's brother makes the Sûta, or the
Governor, to be weaker than himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:18">5:4:4:18</span></span>18. The
Sûta, or the Governor, hands it to the Grâma*n*î (village-headman <span
id="fr_213"></span>[1](#fn_213)), with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art:
therewith serve me!' Thereby the Sûta, or the Governor, makes the
headman to be weaker than himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:19">5:4:4:19</span></span>19. The
Grâma*n*î hands it to a tribesman <span id="fr_214"></span>[2](#fn_214),
with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!' Thereby the
headman makes the tribesman to be weaker than himself. And as to why
they mutually hand it on in this way, they do so lest there should be a
confusion of classes, and in order that (society) may be in the proper
order.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:20">5:4:4:20</span></span>20.
Thereupon the tribesman and the Pratiprasthât*ri* <span
id="fr_215"></span>[3](#fn_215), with that sacrificial sword, prepare
the gaming-ground, (close) by the original fire <span
id="fr_216"></span>[4](#fn_216), with the puroru*k* verse of the
*S*ukra <span id="fr_217"></span>[5](#fn_217). The *S*ukra is the eater:
he thereby makes (him) the eater.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:21">5:4:4:21</span></span>21.
With the puroru*k* verse of the Manthin <span
id="fr_218"></span>[6](#fn_218) they then put up a shed (vimita). The
Manthin cup is

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

he that is to be eaten,--thus having first made (him) the feeder, they
now make for him one to be fed upon: that is why they put up a shed with
the puroru*k* verse of the Manthin cup.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:22">5:4:4:22</span></span>22. The
Adhvaryu then takes clarified butter in four ladlings, places a piece of
gold on the gaming-ground, and offers with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 29), 'May ample
Agni, the lord of rites, delighted,--may ample Agni, the lord of rites,
accept of the butter, hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:23">5:4:4:23</span></span>23. He
(the Adhvaryu) throws down the dice, with, 'Hallowed by Svâhâ, strive ye
with Sûrya's rays for the middlemost place among brethren!' For that
gaming-ground is the same as 'ample Agni,' and those dice are his coals,
thus it is him (Agni) he thereby pleases; and assuredly in the house of
him who offers the Râ*g*asûya, or who so knows this, the striking <span
id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_219) of that cow is approved of. On those
dice he says, 'Play for the cow!' The two draught oxen of the original
(hall-door) fire are the sacrificial fee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:24">5:4:4:24</span></span>24. He
then says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t!'
And as to why that ceremony is performed between two oblations,--verily,
Pra*g*âpati is that sacrifice which is here performed, and from which
these creatures have been produced,--and, indeed, they are even now
produced after this one;--thus he places him (the Sacrificer) in the
very middle of that Pra*g*âpati, and consecrates him in the very middle:
that is why that ceremony is performed between two oblations.

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Having called for
the *S*rausha*t*, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-formula to Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t,' and offers as the Vasha*t* is uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:4:25">5:4:4:25</span></span>25. He
then puts the i*d*â on (the fire). After the invocation of I*d*â, he
touches water and draws the Mâhendra cup. Having drawn the Mâhendra cup,
he sets the chant agoing. He urges him (the Sacrificer) forward to the
chant: he gets down (from the throne-seat); he is in attendance at the
chant (stotra), in attendance at the recitation (*s*astra).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_209"></span>[106:1](sbe4121.htm#fr_209) The allusions to
the game of dice in the early literature are not sufficiently definite
to enable us to form a clear idea as to the manner in which the game was
played. Sâya*n*a, on our passage (as on Taitt. S. I, 8, 16), remarks
that the dice here used consisted either of gold cowries (shells) or of
gold (dice shaped like) Vibhîtaka nuts. That the (brown) fruit of the
Vibhîtaka tree (Terminalia Bellerica)--being of about the size of a
nutmeg, nearly round, with five slightly flattened sides--was commonly
used for this purpose in early times, we know from the Rig-veda; but we
do not know in what manner the dice were marked in those days. According
<span id="page_107">p. 107</span> to the commentators, the game is
played with five dice, four of which are called k*ri*ta, whilst the
fifth is called kali; and if all the dice fall uniformly (ekarûpa)--i.e.
with the marked sides either upwards or downwards--then the player wins,
and in that case the kali is said to overrule the other dice. In this
case the kali would seem to represent the king. Kâty. *S*r. XV, 7,
18-19, however, admits of another mode of playing, by which the kali
represents the sa*g*âta (tribesman), whilst the king and those that come
after him (in the enumeration in paragraphs 15-20) play the k*ri*ta, &c,
To understand this mode, we have probably to turn to *Kh*andog. Up. IV,
1, 4, where it is said of the saint Raikva, that everything good fell to
him, just as the lower dice (or casts) submit to the conquering k*ri*ta.
Here the commentators assign the names k*ri*ta, tretâ, dvâpara, and kali
to different sides of the die, marked respectively with 4, 3, 2, and 1
marks (aṅka).--In Taitt. Br. I, 7, 10 the game at dice, at the
Râ*g*asûya, is referred to as follows:--With, 'This king has overcome
the regions,' he hands (to the king) five dice; for these are all the
dice: he thereby renders him invincible. They engage (to play) for a
dish of rice (odana), for that is (a symbol of) the chief: he thus makes
him obtain every prosperity. He addresses them (with the epithets of)
'far-famed, most prosperous, true king.' The Commentary and Sûtras then
supply the following explanations:--The keeper of the dice (akshâvâpa),
having (marked off and) raised the gambling-ground (by means of the
wooden sword), and sprinkled it, throws down more than a hundred--or
more than a thousand--gold dice. From them he takes five dice and hands
them to the king: these, as representing the five regions, are taken to
include all those dice. These explanations, so far from clearing up the
doubtful points, seem rather to add to them. It may be noted, however,
that in the well-known hymn, *Ri*k S. X, 34, in which the gambler's
state of mind is pictured in very expressive language, the dice of the
game are apparently spoken of as tripa*ñ*kâ*s*a vrâta, or 'the troop of
fifty-three' (or thrice five, according to Ludwig's rather improbable
conjecture). For other particulars see R. Roth, Zeitsch. d. deutsch.
morg. Ges. II, p. 122; A. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 284. According to
Goldstücker (s.v. abhishe*k*anîya) this game of dice is intended to
symbolize the victory of the present age, or kali-yuga, over the former
ages; but the commentator rather takes it as symbolizing the king's
dig-vi*g*aya, or victorious sway in every quarter.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[108:1](sbe4121.htm#fr_210) If it were not for
the clear and unmistakable interpretation of the commentators on the
Brâhma*n*a and Kâtyâyana, one might feel inclined to translate, 'thus he
addresses the first--the second,' &c., so as to bring it into accord
with the practice of the Black Ya*g*us. This practice is as follows
(Taitt. S. I, 8, 16, with commentary).--The priest moves the previously
uplifted arms of the Sacrificer down to the Vai*s*vadeva dish of curds
(cf. above, V, 4, 3, 27), with, 'Thou art Mitra!--thou art Varu*n*a!' He
then places the khâdira throne-seat on the vedi, covers it with a
leathern (or fur) cover, with, 'Thou art the navel of the Kshatra, the
womb of the Kshatra,' and makes the king sit down with, 'Seat thee on
the pleasant one, seat thee on the soft-seated!' The king sits down,
with, 'May it not injure thee! may it not injure me!' The priest then
addresses him, with, 'He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law,
Varu*n*a in the homesteads, for supreme rule, he the wise!' The priests
and Ratnins (see V, 3, 1, 1 seq.) then sit down in a circle round the
king in. order to do homage to him,--the Adhvaryu being seated towards
the east, the Brahman towards the south, the Hot*ri* <span
id="page_109">p. 109</span> towards the west, the Udgât*ri* towards the
north. The king then addresses the Adhvaryu, with, 'O Brahman, (Om)!'
That priest replies, 'Thou, O king, art Brahman, thou art Savit*ri* of
true impulsion.' In the same way the king addresses the Brahman, 'O
Brahman!' and that priest replies, 'Thou, O king, art Brahman, thou art
Indra, of true energy!' Then the Hot*ri*, who replies, '. . . thou art
Mitra, the most kindly!'--the Udgât*ri*: '. . . thou art Varu*n*a, of
true laws!' Thereupon the Brahman hands the sacrificial sword to the
king, with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art!' He then hands to him five
dice, with, 'This king has overcome the regions!' see next note.--The
charioteer, treasurer, and chamberlain are invited by the king (to the
game?) by auspicious epithets ('far-famed one,' 'most prosperous one,'
'true king'). Thereupon the Hot*ri* recites the story of *S*una*hs*epa,
whereupon follows the offering of the svish*t*ak*ri*t of the cake of the
Maruts, and the dish of curds to the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[109:1](sbe4121.htm#fr_211) Or, he whose
strength is the people (vi*s*, vi*s*a),--that is, the Maruts, in the
case of Indra, and the subjects or peasantry in that of the king. Sây.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[110:1](sbe4121.htm#fr_212) That is, increaser
of the prosperity of himself and his people.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[111:1](sbe4121.htm#fr_213) See [p.
60](sbe4113.htm#page_60), note \*[1](sbe4113.htm#fn_129)\*.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[111:2](sbe4121.htm#fr_214) The sa*g*âta would
seem to be one of the peasant proprietors or 'sharers' constituting the
village 'brotherhood' ruled over by the headman, and often actually
belonging to the same family as the latter (Gaugenosse, clansman).

<span id="fn_215"></span>[111:3](sbe4121.htm#fr_215) The first assistant
of the Adhvaryu.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[111:4](sbe4121.htm#fr_216) That is, north of
the Âhavanîya fire, where the cart stands, containing the original
(hall-door) fire.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[111:5](sbe4121.htm#fr_217) For this verse
(Vâ*g*. S. VII, 12; *Ri*k S. V, 44, 1), preceding the ordinary formula
with which the Soma-cups are drawn, see IV, 2, 1, 9 (part ii, p. 280).

<span id="fn_218"></span>[111:6](sbe4121.htm#fr_218) Vâ*g*. S. VII, 16;
*Ri*k S. X, 723, 7; see IV, 2, 7, 70.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[112:1](sbe4121.htm#fr_219) Thus (not the
slaying) according to the commentary on Kâty. Sr. XV, 7, 20, hanti*s*
*k*âhananamâtro na mâra*n*ârtha*h*.--The cow is the one staked by the
tribesman (sa*g*âta).
