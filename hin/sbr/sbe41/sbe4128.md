# SIXTH KÂ*ND*A.

#### THE AGNI*K*AYANA, OR BUILDING OF THE FIRE-ALTAR.

#### CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE.

### FIRST ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:1">6:1:1:1</span></span>1.
Verily, in the beginning there was here the non-existent <span
id="fr_282"></span>[1](#fn_282.md). As to this they say, 'What was that
non-existent?' The *Ri*shis, assuredly,--it is they that were the
non-existent <span id="fr_283"></span>[2](#fn_283.md). As to this they say,
'Who were those *Ri*shis?' The *Ri*shis, doubtless, were the vital airs:
inasmuch as before (the existence of) this universe, they, desiring it,
wore themselves out (rish) with toil and austerity, therefore (they are
called) *Ri*shis.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:2">6:1:1:2</span></span>2. This
same vital air in the midst doubtless is Indra. He, by his power
(indriya), kindled those (other) vital airs from the midst; and inasmuch
as he kindled (indh), he is the kindler (indha): the kindler <span
id="fr_284"></span>[3](#fn_284.md) indeed,--him they call 'Indra'
mystically

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (esoterically),
for the gods love the mystic. They (the vital airs), being kindled,
created seven separate persons <span id="fr_285"></span>[1](#fn_285.md)
(purusha).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:3">6:1:1:3</span></span>3. They
said, 'Surely, being thus, we shall not be able to generate: let us make
these seven persons one Person!' They made those seven persons one
Person: they compressed two of them <span
id="fr_286"></span>[2](#fn_286) (into.md) what is above the navel, and two
of them (into) what is below the navel; (one) person was (one) wing (or
side), (one) person was (the other) wing, and one person was the base
(i.e. the feet).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:4">6:1:1:4</span></span>4. And
what excellence, what life-sap (rasa) there was in those seven persons,
that they concentrated above, that became his head. And because (in it)
they concentrated the excellence (*s*rî), therefore it is (called) the
head (*s*iras). It was thereto that the breaths resorted (*s*ri):
therefore also it is the head (*s*iras). And because the breaths did so
resort (*s*ri) thereto, therefore also the breaths (vital airs, and
their organs) are elements of excellence (*s*rî). And because they
resorted to the whole (system) therefore (this is called) body
(*s*arîra).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:5">6:1:1:5</span></span>5. That
same Person became Pra*g*âpati (lord of generation). And that Person
which became Pra*g*âpati is this very Agni (fire-altar), who is now (to
be) built.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:6">6:1:1:6</span></span>6. He
verily is composed of seven persons, for this Person (Agni) is composed
of seven persons <span id="fr_287"></span>[3](#fn_287.md),

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

to wit, the body (trunk) of four, and the wings and tail of three; for
the body of that (first) Person (was composed of) four, and the wings
and tail of three. And inasmuch as he makes the body larger by one
person, by that force the body raises the wings and tail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:7">6:1:1:7</span></span>7. And as
to the fire which is deposited on the built (altar),--whatever
excellence, whatever life-sap there was in those seven persons, that
they now concentrate above, that is his (Pra*g*âpati's) head. On that
same (head) all the gods are dependent (*s*rita), for it is there that
offering is made to all the gods: therefore also it is the head
(*s*iras).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:8">6:1:1:8</span></span>8. Now
this Person Pra*g*âpati desired, 'May I be more (than one), may I be
reproduced!' He toiled, he practised austerity. Being worn out with toil
and austerity, he created first of all the Brahman (neut.), the triple
science. It became to him a foundation: hence they say, 'the Brahman
(Veda) is the foundation of everything here.' Wherefore, having studied
(the Veda) one rests on a foundation; for this, to wit, the Veda, is his
foundation. Resting on that foundation, he (again) practised austerity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:9">6:1:1:9</span></span>9. He
created the waters out of Vâ*k* (speech, that is) the world; for speech
belonged to it <span id="fr_288"></span>[1](#fn_288.md): that was

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

created (set free). It pervaded everything here; and because it pervaded
(âp) whatsoever there was here, therefore (it is called) water (âpa*h*);
and because it covered (var), therefore also it (is called) water (vâr).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:10">6:1:1:10</span></span>10. He
desired, 'May I be reproduced from these waters!' He entered the waters
with that triple science. Thence an egg arose. He touched it. 'Let it
exist! let it exist and multiply!' so he said. From it the Brahman
(neut.) was first created, the triple science. Hence they say, 'The
Brahman (n.) is the first-born of this All.' For even before that Person
the Brahman was created <span id="fr_289"></span>[1](#fn_289.md): it was
created as his mouth. Hence they say of him who has studied the Veda,
that 'he is like Agni;' for it, the Brahman (Veda), is Agni's mouth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:11">6:1:1:11</span></span>11. Now
the embryo which was inside was created as the foremost (agri): inasmuch
as it was created foremost (agram) of this All, therefore (it is called)
Agri: Agri, indeed, is he whom they mystically call <span
id="fr_290"></span>[2](#fn_290.md) Agni; for the gods love the mystic. And
the tear (a*s*ru, n.) which had formed itself <span
id="fr_291"></span>[3](#fn_291) [became](errata.htm#12.md) the 'a*s*ru'
(m.): 'a*s*ru' indeed is what they mystically call 'a*s*va' (horse), for
the gods love the

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

mystic. And that which, as it were, cried <span
id="fr_292"></span>[1](#fn_292) (ras), became the ass (râsabha.md). And the
juice which was adhering to the shell (of the egg) became the he-goat
(a*g*a <span id="fr_293"></span>[2](#fn_293).md). And that which was the
shell became the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:12">6:1:1:12</span></span>12. He
desired, 'May I generate, this (earth) from these waters!' He compressed
it <span id="fr_294"></span>[3](#fn_294.md) and threw it into the water.
The juice which flowed from it became a tortoise; and that which was
spirted upwards (became) what is produced above here over the wafers.
This whole (earth) dissolved itself all over the water: all this
(universe) appeared as one form only, namely, water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:13">6:1:1:13</span></span>13. He
desired, 'May it become more than one, may it reproduce itself!' He
toiled and practised austerity; and worn out with toil and austerity, he
created foam. He was aware that 'this indeed looks different, it is
becoming more (than one): I must toil, indeed!' Worn out with toil and
austerity, he created clay, mud, saline soil and sand, gravel (pebble),
rock, ore, gold, plants and trees: therewith he clothed this earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:14">6:1:1:14</span></span>14.
This (earth), then, was created as (consisting of) these same nine
creations. Hence they say, 'Threefold (three times three) is Agni;' for
Agni is this (earth), since thereof the whole Agni (fire-altar) is
constructed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:1:15">6:1:1:15</span></span>15.
'This (earth) has indeed become (bhû) a foundation!' (he thought): hence
it became the earth (bhûmi). He spread it out (prath), and it

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

became the broad one (or earth, p*ri*thivî). And she (the earth),
thinking herself quite perfect <span id="fr_295"></span>[1](#fn_295.md),
sang; and inasmuch as she sang (gâ), therefore she is Gâyatrî. But they
also say, 'It was Agni, indeed, on her (the earth's) back, who thinking
himself quite perfect, sang; and inasmuch as he sang (gâ), therefore
Agni is Gâyatra.' And hence whosoever thinks himself quite perfect,
either sings or delights in song <span id="fr_296"></span>[2](#fn_296.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_282"></span>[143:1](sbe4128.htm#fr_282.md) Or, perhaps, In the
beginning this (universe) was indeed nonexistent. Thus J. Muir, Or. S.
T. IV, p. 22, of which translation of this cosmogonic myth considerable
use has been made here. It need scarcely be remarked that 'idam' is
constantly used in an adverbial sense in the Brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[143:2](sbe4128.htm#fr_283.md) In the original,
'the non-existent' is the subject of the clause, not the predicate as
would appear from the translation. A similar transposition seems often
advisable in English, for the sake of emphasis, and on other grounds.
Muir's rendering, 'The Rishis say that in the beginning there was
non-existence,' is a mistake.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[143:3](sbe4128.htm#fr_284.md) The nominative here
is striking, and vivid, cf. [paragraph 11](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:11.md) below.
In corresponding passages of the preceding books, the accusative would
stand here; e*g*. II, 1, 2, 4, saptarshîn u ha sma vai purarkshâ ity
â*k*akshate; similarly III, 1, 2, 3.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[144:1](sbe4128.htm#fr_285.md) That is, living
beings or souls, individualities, which, in their combined form, are
here imagined to take the shape of a bird. Muir's rendering, 'males,'
can scarcely commend itself.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[144:2](sbe4128.htm#fr_286.md) Literally, 'those
two.'

<span id="fn_287"></span>[144:3](sbe4128.htm#fr_287.md) The fire-altar is
usually constructed so as to measure seven <span id="page_145">p.
145</span> man's lengths square; the particular length being that of the
Sacrificer. This, however, is the smallest size allowed for an altar,
there being altogether ninety-five different sizes specified, varying
between seven and 101 man's lengths square.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[145:1](sbe4128.htm#fr_288.md) Or, perhaps, to him
(Pra*g*âpati). Sâya*n*a merely says,--vâg evâsya sâs*rig*yata, vâk
sahakâri rasanam abhavat, tad as*rig*yatety artha*h*; sâ vâk sahakâri
rasanam prâ*g*âpatya(*m*) s*ri*sh*t*a*m* sad ida*m* sarvam âpnot.--On
the part which Vâ*k* (the personification of the Brahman or Veda) takes
by the side of Pra*g*âpati in the creation <span id="page_146">p.
146</span> of the universe, and the parallelism between Vâ*k* and λόγοσ,
see Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 473 seq.; Muir, Or. S. T. V, p. 391. Thus
Pa*ñk*. Br. XX, 14, 2, 'Pra*g*âpati alone existed here. He had Vâ*k*
indeed as his own, as a second to him.'

<span id="fn_289"></span>[146:1](sbe4128.htm#fr_289.md) Muir takes this
differently,--Further, (as) the Veda was first created from that Male,
therefore it was created his mouth. This translation, however, takes no
account of the particle 'hi.'

<span id="fn_290"></span>[146:2](sbe4128.htm#fr_290.md) For the
construction, see above, [paragraph 2](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:2.md), with note
\*[3](#fn_284.md)\*.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[146:3](sbe4128.htm#fr_291.md) Literally, which
had flowed together. It is explained as the embryonic liquid in the
amnion, or innermost membrane enveloping the foetus.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[147:1](sbe4128.htm#fr_292.md) ? Or, that part (of
the egg) which made a noise (in cracking).

<span id="fn_293"></span>[147:2](sbe4128.htm#fr_293.md) The word 'a*g*a' is
apparently fancifully taken here in the sense of 'unborn (a-*g*a).'

<span id="fn_294"></span>[147:3](sbe4128.htm#fr_294.md) That is, the earth
when as yet in the form of the egg-shell.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[148:1](sbe4128.htm#fr_295.md)
Abhimâninîstrîvigrahâ yasmâd agâyad tasmâd iya*m* Gâyatrî,
Sây.--'Because, like a haughty woman, she (the earth) sang, therefore
she is Gâyatrî.'

<span id="fn_296"></span>[148:2](sbe4128.htm#fr_296.md) On this
illustration, which might either be taken as applying to men in easy
circumstances, not troubled with cares;--or, perhaps, to a new-born
child which cries out lustily, and likes to be sung to,--Sâya*n*a only
remarks,--tasmâd u haitad iti svabhâvânuvâda*h*, kâryadharme*n*a
kâra*n*adharmânupâdanâya.
