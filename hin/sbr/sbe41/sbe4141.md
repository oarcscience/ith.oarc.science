#### THE MAKING OF THE FIRE-PAN (UKHÂ).

### FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:1:1">6:5:1:1</span></span>1. That
water (used for working the clay) has been boiled by means of resin of
the palâ*s*a tree (butea frondosa), just for the sake of firmness. And
as to why (it is done) by palâ*s*a resin;--the palâ*s*a tree doubtless
is Soma <span id="fr_461"></span>[1](#fn_459), and Soma is the moon, and
that (moon) indeed is one of Agni's

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

forms: it is for the obtainment of that form of Agni (that palâ*s*a
resin is used).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:1:2">6:5:1:2</span></span>2. He
pours it on (the clay), with (Vâ*g*. S. XI, 50-52; *Ri*k S. X, 9, 1-3),
'Refreshing ye are, O waters <span id="fr_462"></span>[1](#fn_460)!' To
whatever deity a *Ri*k-verse, and to whatever deity a Ya*g*us formula
applies, that *Ri*k-verse is that very deity, and that Ya*g*us formula
is that very deity: hence this triplet (XI, 50-52) is these waters, and
they are those very waters which appeared as one form <span
id="fr_463"></span>[2](#fn_461): that form he now makes it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:1:3">6:5:1:3</span></span>3. He
then produces foam and puts it thereto: the second form which was
created (in the shape of) foam <span id="fr_464"></span>[3](#fn_462),
that form he thus makes it. And the clay he now mixes is that very clay
which was created as the third form. It was from these forms that he
(Agni) was created at the beginning, and from them he now produces him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:1:4">6:5:1:4</span></span>4. He
then mixes it with the goat's hair, just for the sake of firmness. And
as to why with goat's hair,--the gods then collected him (Agni) from out
of the cattle, and in like manner does this one now collect him from out
of the cattle. And as to why with goat's hair, it is because in the
he-goat (is contained) the form of all cattle; and as to its being hair,
form is hair <span id="fr_465"></span>[4](#fn_463).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:1:5">6:5:1:5</span></span>5.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 53\] 'Mitra having mixed the earth and ground with
light,'--Mitra doubtless

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

is the breath, and the breath first did this sacred work;--'I mix
(fashion) thee, the well-born knower of beings, for health to
creatures,'--as the text, so its meaning.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:1:6">6:5:1:6</span></span>6. Then
there are these three kinds of powder (dust)--(sand of) gravel, stone,
and iron-rust--therewith he mixes (the clay), just for firmness. And as
to why (it is mixed) therewith, it is because thereof this (earth)
consisted when it was created in the beginning: thus whatlike this
(earth) was created in the beginning, such he now makes it (the earth,
or fire-pan).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:1:7">6:5:1:7</span></span>7.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 54\] 'The Rudras, having mixed the earth, kindled the
great light;'--for this Agni is yonder sun: thus it is that great light
which the Rudras, having mixed the earth, did kindle;--'yea,
never-failing and brilliant, their light shineth among the gods;'--for
that never-failing and brilliant light of theirs does indeed shine among
the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:1:8">6:5:1:8</span></span>8. With
two (verses) he mixes (the clay),--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the
Sacrificer is Agni as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so
great he thus mixes (fashions) him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:1:9">6:5:1:9</span></span>9. He
then kneads it, with(Vâ*g*. S. XI, 55), 'Mixed by the Vasus, the
Rudras,'--for this (clay) has indeed been mixed both by the Vasus and
the Rudras: by the Vasus, because by Mitra and by the Rudras, because by
the Rudras;--'by the wise, the clay suitable for the work;'--for wise
those (gods) are, and suitable for the (sacred) work is this
clay;--'making it soft with her hands, may Sinîvalî fashion
it!'--Sinîvalî doubtless is speech: thus, 'May she, having made it soft
with her hands, fashion it!'

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:1:10">6:5:1:10</span></span>10.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 56\] 'Sinîvalî, the fair-knotted, fair-braided,
fair-locked,'--for Sinîvalî is a woman, and that is indeed the perfect
form of woman, to wit, the fair-knotted, fair-braided, fair-locked: he
thus makes her perfect;--'may she place the fire-pan into thy hands, O
great Aditi!'--the great Aditi doubtless is this earth: it is to this
earth that he says this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:1:11">6:5:1:11</span></span>11.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XI, 57\] 'Let Aditi fashion the fire-pan, by her skill, her
arms, her wisdom!'--for by her skill, by her arms, and by her wisdom she
does indeed fashion it;--'may she bear Agni in her womb, even as a
mother (bears) her son in her lap!'--that is, 'as a mother would bear
her son in her lap, so may she (Aditi) bear Agni in her womb!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:5:1:12">6:5:1:12</span></span>12.
With three (formulas) he kneads (the clay),--threefold is Agni: as great
as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus kneads him.
With two (verses) he mixes,--that makes five;--of five layers consists
the fire-altar (Agni); five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as
great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
With three (formulas) he pours water thereto,--that makes eight;--of
eight syllables the Gâyatrî metre consists, and Agni is Gâyatra: as
great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
And, moreover, as one of eight syllables <span
id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_464) this (earth) was created in the
beginning: thus as great as this (earth) was created in the beginning,
so great he thus makes this (fire-pan representing the earth).

<span id="fn_460"></span>[230:1](sbe4141.htm#fr_462) The whole triplet
runs thus: 'Refreshing ye are, O waters; lead us to strength, to see
great joy!--whatever is your most benign sap, therein let us share, like
loving mothers!--For you we will readily go to him, to whose abode ye
urge us, O waters, and quicken us.'

of cattle is the most obvious characteristic of their outward
appearance.
