### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:1">7:5:2:1</span></span>1. He
puts the heads of the victims in (the fire-pan),--the heads of the
victims being animals (or cattle), it is animals he thus puts thereon.
He puts them in the fire-pan;--the pan being these worlds, and the heads
of the victims being beasts, he thus

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

puts animals in these worlds; whence there are animals in these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:2">7:5:2:2</span></span>2. And as
to why (he puts the heads) in the fire-pan;--the fire-pan being a womb,
and the heads of the victims being animals, he thus establishes the
animals in the womb: hence animals, though being eaten and cooked, do
not diminish, for he establishes them in the womb.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:3">7:5:2:3</span></span>3. And,
again, why he puts the heads of the victims therein;--what (animal)
perfections (*s*rî) <span id="fr_739"></span>[1](#fn_736.md) there were,
they are these victims’ heads; and what rumps there were, they are those
five layers (of the altar). Now those five layers are these worlds, and
these worlds are this very fire-pan: thus, when he puts the heads of the
victims in the fire-pan, he thereby unites those rumps with those heads.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:4">7:5:2:4</span></span>4. He
puts them in the fore-part, so as to look towards the back (west). For
when, on that (former) occasion, Pra*g*âpati wanted to slaughter these
animals, they, being about to be slaughtered, wanted to run away. He
seized them by (the organs of) the vital airs <span
id="fr_740"></span>[2](#fn_737.md); and having seized them by the vital
airs, he took them into himself from the front (mouth) towards the back
(inside).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:5">7:5:2:5</span></span>5. Now
the same thing which the gods did is done here. The animals do not,
indeed, want to run away from him; but when he does this, it is because
he wants to do what the gods did: having thus seized them by (the
outlets of) the vital airs, he takes them into himself from the front
towards the back.

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:6">7:5:2:6</span></span>6. And,
again, why he puts the heads of the victims thereon. Pra*g*âpati alone
was here at first <span id="fr_741"></span>[1](#fn_738.md). He desired,
'May I create food, may I be reproduced!' He fashioned animals from his
vital airs, a man from his soul (mind), a horse from his eye, a cow from
his breath, a sheep from his ear, and a goat from his voice; and
inasmuch as he created them from the vital airs, people say that
'Animals are vital airs.' The soul is the first of the vital airs; and
inasmuch as he fashioned man from his soul, they say that 'Man is the
first, and strongest of animals.' The soul is all the vital airs, for in
the soul all the vital airs are established. And inasmuch as he
fashioned man from his soul, they say that 'Man is all animals,' for
they all belong to man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:7">7:5:2:7</span></span>7. Having
created that food, he took it into himself from the front towards the
back; and hence whosoever prepares for himself food, takes it into
himself from the front towards the back (inside). That (animal food
being put) in the fire-pan, and the fire-pan being the belly, he thus
puts the food into the belly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:8">7:5:2:8</span></span>8. He now
(in the first place <span id="fr_742"></span>[2](#fn_739).md) thrusts gold
chips into each of them,--gold is vital air, and the vital airs go out
of these animals when slaughtered: thus, when he thrusts gold chips into
each of them, he puts the vital airs into them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:9">7:5:2:9</span></span>9. Seven
(chips) he thrusts into each,--seven vital airs there are in the head:
these he thereby puts into it. And if there are five victims, let him
thrust in five times seven (chips); for those five victims he puts on
(the fire-pan), and there are seven vital

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

airs in each victim: he thus puts the vital airs into all of them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:10">7:5:2:10</span></span>10.
Now, even if there is only one victim <span
id="fr_743"></span>[1](#fn_740.md), some people thrust five times seven
(into that one head), thinking, 'Those five victims he puts down
(symbolically), and there are seven vital airs in each victim: thus we
put the vital airs into all of them.' Let him not do so, for in this
animal the form of all animals is contained <span
id="fr_744"></span>[2](#fn_741); and when he thrusts (seven chips.md) into
this one, he thereby puts the vital airs into all of them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:11">7:5:2:11</span></span>11. The
first (chip) he thrusts into the mouth, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 38; *Ri*k
S. IV, 58, 6, 5), 'Fitly flow the draughts of milk like
rivers,'--draughts of milk are food, and that indeed flows fitly into
this mouth;--'purified within by the heart, by the mind,'--for the food
is indeed purified by the heart and mind within him who is
righteous;--'the streams of ghee I behold,' he thereby means the
libations he is about to offer on that fire;--'the golden reed (is) in
the middle of Agni,' he thereby means that gold man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:12">7:5:2:12</span></span>12.
With (Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 39), 'For praise thee!' (he thrusts one in) here
(into the right nostril); praise (or splendour) means breath, for with
breath one praises;--with, 'For sheen thee!' here (into the left
nostril); sheen means breath, for by breath one shines; and also because
everything here shines for breath;--with, 'For brightness thee!' here
(into the right eye);--with, 'For lustre thee!' here

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (into the left
eye), for bright and lustrous these two eyes indeed are;--with, 'This
hath become the fiery spirit of all the world, and of Agni
Vai*s*vânara,' here (into the right ear);--with (Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 40),
'Agni, bright with brightness, the golden disk, lustrous with lustre,'
here (into the left ear),--thus with two (formulas) containing
'all <span id="fr_745"></span>[1](#fn_742.md)'; for the ear is all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:13">7:5:2:13</span></span>13. He
then lifts up the human head--he thereby exalts it--with, 'Giver of a
thousand thou art: for a thousand thee!' a thousand means everything:
thus, 'the giver of everything, for everything (I bestow) thee!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:14">7:5:2:14</span></span>14. He
then puts them (the heads) in (the fire-pan), first (that of) the
man--having taken possession of the man by strength he sets him up;--the
man in the middle; on both sides the other victims: he thus sets the
man, as the eater, in the midst of cattle; whence man is the eater in
the midst of cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:15">7:5:2:15</span></span>15. The
horse and ram on the left (north) side: he thereby puts those two (kinds
of) cattle in that region; whence those two (kinds of) cattle are most
plentiful in that region.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:16">7:5:2:16</span></span>16. The
bull and he-goat on the right (south) side: he thereby puts those two
(kinds of) cattle in that region; whence those two (kinds of) cattle are
most plentiful in that region.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:17">7:5:2:17</span></span>17. The
(head of the) man he places on the milk <span
id="fr_746"></span>[2](#fn_743.md),--milk means cattle: he thus establishes
the Sacrificer among cattle,--with (Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 41), 'With

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

milk anoint thou Âditya, the unborn child!' that unborn child, the man,
is indeed the sun: thus, Him anoint thou with milk!--'the all-shaped
maker of a thousand,' the maker <span id="fr_747"></span>[1](#fn_744.md) of
a thousand is man; for to him belong a thousand;--'spare him with thy
heat, harbour not evil thoughts against him!' that is, spare him with
thy fire, do not hurt him!--'make him live a hundred years, while thou
art built!' he thereby makes man the one among animals (capable of)
living a hundred years; whence man, among animals, lives up to- a
hundred years.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:18">7:5:2:18</span></span>18.
Then on the left side (he puts the head of) the horse, with (Vâ*g*. S.
XIII, 42), 'The speed of the wind,'--this one, the horse, is indeed the
speed of the wind;--'Varu*n*a's navel'--for the horse is Varu*n*a;--'the
horse, born in the midst of the flood;' the flood is the water, and the
horse is indeed the water-born;--'the tawny, rock-founded child of
rivers;' rock means mountain, and the waters are indeed founded on the
mountains;--'harm him not, Agni, in the highest region!' the highest
region means these worlds: thus, do not harm him in these worlds!

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:19">7:5:2:19</span></span>19.
Then on the right side (the head of) the bull, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIII,
43), 'The imperishable, red drop,' the drop doubtless is Soma; and that
bull is the same as the imperishable Soma;--'the eager one
(bhura*n*yu),' that is, the bearer (bhart*ri*);--'Agni, the
forward-striving, I glorify with homages;' for

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

the bull is sacred to Agni; and 'the forward-striving,' he says, because
forward (towards the east) they hold up Agni <span
id="fr_748"></span>[1](#fn_745.md), and towards the front <span
id="fr_749"></span>[2](#fn_746.md) they attend upon him;--'duly fitting
thyself by limbs,' when he is built up, then he does indeed duly fit
himself limb by limb;--'harm not the inexhaustible, wide-ruling
cow <span id="fr_750"></span>[3](#fn_747.md),' the cow is indeed
wide-ruling (virâ*g*), and the wide-ruling is food, and accordingly the
cow is food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:20">7:5:2:20</span></span>20.
Then on the left side (he puts the head of) the ram, with (Vâ*g*. S.
XIII, 44), 'The defender of Tvash*tri*, the navel of Varu*n*a,' for the
ewe is sacred both to Varu*n*a and to Tvash*tri*;--'the ewe born from
the highest sphere;' the highest sphere doubtless is the ear, and the
ear is the regions,--(thus <span id="fr_751"></span>[4](#fn_748).md) the
highest sphere is the regions;--'the mighty, thousandfold artifice of
the Âsura,' that is, the great, thousandfold artifice of the Âsura <span
id="fr_752"></span>[5](#fn_749.md);--'O Agni, harm it not in the highest

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

region!' the highest region are these worlds: thus, do not harm him (the
ram) in these worlds!

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:21">7:5:2:21</span></span>21.
Then on the right side (he puts the head of) the he-goat, with (Vâ*g*.
S. XII I, 45), 'The Agni who was born from Agni,' for that Agni was
indeed born from Agni <span id="fr_753"></span>[1](#fn_750.md);--'from the
pain of the earth or also of the sky;' for what was born from the pain
(or heat) of Pra*g*âpati, that was born from the pain of the sky and the
earth;--'whereby Vi*s*vakarman begat living beings,'--the he-goat (or,
the unborn one) is Vâ*k* (Speech) <span id="fr_754"></span>[2](#fn_751.md),
and from Vâ*k* Vi*s*vakarman <span id="fr_755"></span>[3](#fn_752.md) begat
living beings;--'him, O Agni, may thy wrath spare!' as the text, so the
meaning.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:22">7:5:2:22</span></span>22.
These are the victims; separately he puts them down, separately he
'settles' them, and separately he pronounces the Sûdadohas on them; for
separate from one another are those animals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:23">7:5:2:23</span></span>23. He
then offers on the human head,--sacrifice is offering: he thus makes man
the one among animals fit to sacrifice; whence man alone among animals
performs sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:24">7:5:2:24</span></span>24.
And, again, why he offers thereon:--he thereby lays vigour into the
head. He offers with ghee,--ghee is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt
means vigour: he thus lays vigour into it. With 'Hail' (he offers),--the
'Hail' (svâhâkâra, m.) is a male, and the male means vigour: he thus
lays vigour into it. With a trish*t*ubh verse (he offers);the
Trish*t*ubh is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

means vigour; the Trish*t*ubh is vigour: with vigour he thus lays vigour
into it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:25">7:5:2:25</span></span>25.
Having run through <span id="fr_756"></span>[1](#fn_753) the (first.md)
half-verse, he pronounces the Svâhâ;--the *rik* (verse) is a bone:
having cleft asunder that skull-bone which is here inside the head, he
there lays vigour into it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:26">7:5:2:26</span></span>26.
Having then run through the (second) half-verse, he pronounces the
Svâhâ,--having joined together that skull-bone which is here on the top
of the head, he there lays vigour into it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:27">7:5:2:27</span></span>27.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 46; *Ri*k S. I, 115, 1\] 'The brilliant front of the
gods hath risen,' for that man is yonder sun, and he indeed rises as the
brilliant front (face) of the gods;--'the eye of Mitra, Varu*n*a, and
Agni,' for that (sun) is the eye of both gods and men;--'he hath filled
heaven, and earth, and the air,' for when he rises he indeed fills these
worlds;--'Sûrya, the soul of the movable and immovable;' for that (sun)
is indeed the soul of everything here that moves and stands.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:28">7:5:2:28</span></span>28. He
then stands by (the heads, revering them) with the Utsargas <span
id="fr_757"></span>[2](#fn_754.md). For at that time when Pra*g*âpati
wanted to slaughter the victims, they, being about to be slaughtered,
were distressed (or pained); and by these Utsargas he drove out their
distress <span id="fr_758"></span>[3](#fn_755.md), their evil. In like
manner does this one, by these Utsargas, now drive out their distress,
their evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:29">7:5:2:29</span></span>29. Now
some remove the distress of whichever (head of a) victim they put down,
thinking lest they might put distress, evil, thereon; but it is they
that

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

put distress, evil, thereon; for the distress they remove from the
preceding one, they put on (the altar) with the succeeding one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:30">7:5:2:30</span></span>30. And
some revere (the heads) whilst moving round them, thinking, 'we remove
distress upwards;' but these indeed follow the distress, the evil,
upwards; for upwards he (the Sacrificer) goes by this performance <span
id="fr_759"></span>[1](#fn_756.md), and upwards they remove the distress.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:31">7:5:2:31</span></span>31. Let
him remove it outside the fire (-altar); that fire (-altar) being these
worlds, he thus puts distress outside these worlds;--outside the Vedi;
the Vedi being this earth, he thus puts distress outside this earth; (he
does so) standing with his face towards the north; for in that region
those animals are, and he thus puts distress into them in the region in
which they are.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:32">7:5:2:32</span></span>32. He
first removes that of the man--for him he puts down first--with (Vâ*g*.
S. XIII, 47), 'Harm not this two-footed animal!' the two-footed animal
doubtless is the same as man: thus, 'do not harm that one!'--'(thou) the
thousand-eyed, being built for pith;'--the thousand-eyed he (Agni) is on
account of the chips of gold; 'for pith,' that is, 'for
food.'--'Graciously accept thou, O Agni, the sham-man, the victim, as
pith!' a sham-man is a kim-purusha (mock-man) <span
id="fr_760"></span>[2](#fn_757.md): thus, 'accept graciously the
kim-purusha, O Agni!'--'Building up therewith thy forms, get thee
settled!' the form is the self: thus, 'Building up

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

therewith, perfect thyself <span id="fr_761"></span>[1](#fn_758.md)!'--'Let
thy burning heat reach the sham-man! let thy burning heat reach him whom
we hate!' he thereby lays burning heat into the sham-man, and into him
whom he hates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:33">7:5:2:33</span></span>33.
Then that of the horse, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 48), 'Harm not this
one-hoofed animal!' the one-hoofed animal doubtless is the same as the
horse: thus, do not harm that one!--'the racer neighing among the
racers;' for neighing indeed he is, and a racer among racers;--'The wild
fallow (beast) do I assign unto thee,' he thereby assigns to him the
wild fallow (beast) <span id="fr_762"></span>[2](#fn_759.md);--'building up
therewith thy forms, get thee settled!' that is, 'building up therewith,
perfect thyself!'--'Let thy burning heat reach the fallow beast! let thy
burning heat reach him whom we hate!' he thereby lays burning heat into
the fallow beast, and into him whom he hates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:34">7:5:2:34</span></span>34.
Then that of the bull, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 49), 'This thousandfold,
hundred-streamed well--,' for a thousandfold, hundred-streamed well he,
the bull (cow), indeed is;--'extended in the middle of the flood,' the
flood doubtless are these worlds: thus, subsisted upon in these
worlds;--'the inexhaustible, milking ghee for man,'--for ghee this
inexhaustible (cow) indeed milks for man--

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'harm not, O Agni,
in the highest region!' the highest region doubtless are these worlds:
thus, do not harm it in these worlds!--'The wild buffalo do I assign
unto thee,' he thereby assigns to him the wild buffalo
(gavaya);--'building up therewith thy forms, get thee settled!' that is,
'building up therewith, perfect thyself!'--'Let thy burning heat reach
the buffalo! let thy burning heat reach him whom we hate!' he thereby
lays burning heat into the buffalo, and into him whom he hates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:35">7:5:2:35</span></span>35.
Then that of the sheep, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 50), This woollen--,' that
is, 'this woolly,'--'navel of Varu*n*a,' for the sheep is sacred to
Varu*n*a;--'the skin of animals, two-footed and four-footed,' for that
(sheep) indeed is the skin of both kinds of animals <span
id="fr_763"></span>[1](#fn_760.md), two-footed and four-footed;--'the first
birth-place of Tvash*tri*'s creatures,' for Tvash*tri* indeed fashioned
this as the first form;--'harm not, O Agni, in the highest region!' the
highest region is these worlds: thus, 'do not harm him in these
worlds!'--'The wild buffalo do I assign unto thee,' he thereby assigns
the wild buffalo (ush*t*ra) to him;--'building up therewith thy forms,
get thee settled!' that is, 'building up therewith, perfect
thyself!'--'Let thy burning heat reach the buffalo! let thy burning heat
reach him whom we hate!' he thereby lays burning heat into the buffalo,
and into him whom he hates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:36">7:5:2:36</span></span>36.
Then that of the he-goat, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 51), 'Verily, the
he-goat was produced from Agni's heat;'--that which was produced from

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pra*g*âpati's
heat, was indeed produced from Agni's heat;--'he saw the progenitor at
first,' the progenitor doubtless is Pra*g*âpati: thus, 'he saw
Pra*g*âpati at first;'--'thereby the gods at first (agre) went to the
godhead;' the he-goat <span id="fr_764"></span>[1](#fn_761.md) doubtless is
speech; and from speech the gods doubtless first went to the godhead, to
the summit (agram);--'thereby they went to the height, the wise;' the
height doubtless is the heavenly world: thus, 'thereby they went to the
heavenly world, the wise;'--'The wild *s*arabha do I assign unto
thee,'--he thereby assigns the wild *s*arabha <span
id="fr_765"></span>[2](#fn_762.md) to him;--'building up therewith thy
forms, get thee settled!' that is, 'building up therewith, perfect
thyself!'--'Let thy burning heat reach the *s*arabha! let thy burning
heat reach him whom we hate!' he thereby lays burning heat into the
*s*arabha, and into him whom he hates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:37">7:5:2:37</span></span>37. As
to this they say,--The pain (heat), the evil of these animals, which
Pra*g*âpati drove out, became these five animals; they, with their pith
(sacrificial essence) gone out of them, are pithless, unfit for
sacrifice; a Brâhma*n*a should not eat of them: he consigns them to that
region; whence Par*g*anya does not rain in that region where these are.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:38">7:5:2:38</span></span>38. He
returns (to the offering-fire) and stands thereby worshipping it;--for
when he goes outside the Vedi, whilst Agni (the fire-altar) is only half
built up, he does what is improper; he now makes amends to him to
prevent his doing injury. With

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

a verse to Agni (he worships): it is to Agni he thereby makes
amends;--with an undefined one; the undefined means everything: by means
of everything he thus makes amends to him;--with (a verse) containing
the word 'youngest:' this indeed, to wit, the youngest, is his favourite
form.;--inasmuch as when born he took possession (yu) of everything
here, he is the youngest (yavish*th*a).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:39">7:5:2:39</span></span>39.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 52; *Ri*k S. VIII, 84, 3\] 'Shield thou, O youngest,
the men of the liberal worshipper!' the liberal worshipper is the
Sacrificer, and the men are the people;--'hear thou the songs!' that is,
hear this hymn of praise!--'protect thou kin and self!' the kin (race)
means offspring: thus, 'protect both (the Sacrificer's) offspring and
himself.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:40">7:5:2:40</span></span>40.
Having stepped on the altar and walked round behind the
naturally-perforated (brick), he lays down the Apasyâ*h*
(water-bricks);--now the Apasyâ*h* are the same as water, and the water
has gone out of these victims: he thus puts water into these victims,
when he lays down the Apasyâ*h* (bricks). He lays them down close to the
(heads of the) animals: he thereby puts the water together with the
animals. He lays down five (bricks) in each quarter, for five are those
victims. He lays them down in every (quarter): everywhere he thus puts
water into them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:41">7:5:2:41</span></span>41. Now
the first fifteen are the Apasyâ*h*,--water is a thunderbolt, and the
thunderbolt is fifteenfold;--hence wherever the waters flow, there they
destroy evil; and verily the thunderbolt destroys the evil of this
place: hence, when it rains one should go about uncovered, thinking,
'May that thunderbolt remove evil from me!'

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:42">7:5:2:42</span></span>42. And
the last five are the *Kh*andasyâ*h* (the metres’ bricks);--the metres
are cattle, and cattle is food; or rather the flesh of cattle is food,
and the flesh has departed from these victims: he therefore puts flesh
on those cattle when he lays down the *Kh*andasyâ*h*. He places them
close to the victims: he thereby puts the flesh close to the (bones of
the) cattle. The Apasyâ*h* are inside, the *Kh*andasyâ*h* outside; for
the water is inside, and the flesh outside.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:43">7:5:2:43</span></span>43. As
to this they say, 'If there are that water and that flesh, where then is
the skin, and where the hair?' Well, the skin of cattle is food, and the
hair of cattle is food; and when he lays down the *Kh*andasyâ*h*, that
is the skin of the victims, that is their hair. Or, again, those goats’
hair which are in the fire-pan <span id="fr_766"></span>[1](#fn_763.md),
they are hair. The fire-pan is outside, and the victims’ heads are
inside, for outside is the hair, and inside is the body. 'Whether in the
one way, or whether in the other,' so *S*ândilya was wont to say, 'in
any case we make up the victims wholly and completely.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:44">7:5:2:44</span></span>44.
And, again, why he lays down the Apasyâ*h*. When Pra*g*âpati was
disjointed the water went from him; that being gone, he sank down; and
because he sank down (vi*s*), therefore there are twenty (vi*ms*ati,
viz. such bricks). It flowed from his fingers,--the fingers being the
end, it (the water) went from him in the end.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:45">7:5:2:45</span></span>45. Now
the Pra*g*âpati who became disjointed is this very Agni who is now being
built up; and the water (âpa*h*) which went from him is these very

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Apasyâ*h*;--hence
when he lays them down, he thereby puts back into him that very water
which went from him: therefore he now lays these down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:46">7:5:2:46</span></span>46.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XIII, 43\] 'In the way of the waters I settle thee!' the way
of the waters is the wind; for when he blows hither and thither then the
waters flow: in the wind he 'settles' this (first brick).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:47">7:5:2:47</span></span>47. 'In
the swell of the waters I settle thee!' the swell of the waters is the
plants, for wherever the waters keep swelling there plants grow: in the
plants he settles this (brick).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:48">7:5:2:48</span></span>48. 'In
the ashes of the waters I settle thee!' the ashes of the waters are the
foam: in foam he settles this one.

lightning: in the lightning he settles this one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:50">7:5:2:50</span></span>50. 'In
the path of the waters I settle thee!' the path of the waters is this
earth, for on the earth the waters flow: on this earth he settles this
one. Whatever water flowed from those (five) forms of his, that water he
now (by these five formulas) puts back into him; and those forms
themselves he thereby restores to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:51">7:5:2:51</span></span>51. 'In
the flood, the seat, I settle thee!' the flood is the breath: in the
breath he settles this one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:52">7:5:2:52</span></span>52. 'In
the ocean, the seat, I settle thee!' the sea is the mind; from the
mind-ocean, with speech for a shovel, the gods dug out the triple
science. Thereto this verse applies,--'May the true god know this day
where the gods placed that offering, they who dug it out from the ocean
with

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

sharp shovels;'--the ocean is the mind, the sharp shovel is speech, the
offering is the triple science: it is thereto this verse applies. In the
mind he settles this (brick).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:53">7:5:2:53</span></span>53. 'In
the stream, the seat, I settle thee!' the stream is speech: in speech he
settles this one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:54">7:5:2:54</span></span>54. 'In
the abode of the waters I settle thee!' the abode of the waters is the
eye, for there water always abides: in the eye he settles this one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:55">7:5:2:55</span></span>55. 'In
the goal of the waters I settle thee!' the goal of the waters is the
ear: in the ear he settles this one. Whatever water flowed from those
(five) forms of his, that water he now (by these five formulas) puts
back into him; and those forms themselves he thereby restores to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:56">7:5:2:56</span></span>56. 'In
the seat of the waters I settle thee!' the seat of the waters is the
sky, for in the sky the waters are seated: in the sky he settles this
one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:57">7:5:2:57</span></span>57. 'In
the home of the waters I settle thee!' the home of the waters is the
air: in the air he settles this one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:58">7:5:2:58</span></span>58. 'In
the womb of the waters I settle thee!' the womb of the waters is the
sea: in the sea he settles this one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:59">7:5:2:59</span></span>59. 'In
the sediment of the waters I settle thee!' the sediment (purîsha) of the
waters is sand: in the sand he settles this one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:60">7:5:2:60</span></span>60. 'In
the resort of the waters I settle thee!' the resort of the waters is
food: in food he settles this one. Whatever water flowed from those
(five) forms of his, that water he now (by these five formulas) puts
back into him; and those forms themselves he thereby restores to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:5:2:61">7:5:2:61</span></span>61. 'By

Whatever water flowed from those metres of his, that he now (by these
formulas) puts back into him; and those metres themselves he thereby
restores to him.

These (bricks) are fingers (and toes): he puts them on all sides <span
id="fr_767"></span>[1](#fn_764), for these fingers (and toes.md) are on all
sides; he puts them at the ends, for these fingers (and toes) are at the
ends; in four sets he puts them on, for these fingers (and toes) are in
four sets; five he puts on each time, for there are five fingers (or
toes) at each (limb); separately he puts them on, for separate are these
fingers (and toes); only once he 'settles' each (set): he thereby makes
(each set) one and the same, whence they have a common connecting-link.

putting the heads in the fire-pan.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[403:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_743.md) Viz. a he-goat, as
the animal sacrifice to either Pra*g*âpati, or (Vâyu) Niyutvat; see pp.
[178](sbe4132.htm#page_178), [184](sbe4132.htm#page_184.md).

<span id="fn_741"></span>[403:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_744.md) See [VI, 2, 2,
15](sbe4132.htm#6:2:2:15.md).

<span id="fn_742"></span>[404:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_745.md) Only the first of
the two formulas, however, contains the word 'vi*s*va,' all.

<span id="fn_743"></span>[404:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_746.md) The pan was partly
filled with sand and milk, see [VII, 1, 1, 41](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:41.md),
[44](sbe4155.htm#7:1:1:44.md).

<span id="fn_744"></span>[405:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_747.md) 'Pratimâ' is
perhaps taken here by the dogmatic expositor in the sense of 'likeness,
counterpart;' in which case one would have to translate, 'the
counterpart of a thousand, the all-shaped one.'

<span id="fn_745"></span>[406:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_748.md) See [VI, 4, 3,
10](sbe4139.htm#6:4:3:10.md).

<span id="fn_746"></span>[406:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_749.md) Or, 'they attend
upon him (Agni, the fire-altar) who tends towards the front (east);'
inasmuch as the altar is built in the shape of a bird flying eastwards.

<span id="fn_747"></span>[406:3](sbe4166.htm#fr_750.md) Or, harm not the
cow, the wide-ruling (or wide-shining) Aditi!

<span id="fn_748"></span>[406:4](sbe4166.htm#fr_751.md) After the two
premises (with 'vai') the inference seems here to be introduced without
any particle. Similarly in paragraph [24](sbe4166.htm#7:5:2:24.md); while
in paragraph [19](sbe4166.htm#7:5:2:19.md) the particle 'u' is used to
perform that office. Cf. however [VII, 4, 2, 1](sbe4164.htm#7:4:2:1.md),
where a third parallel clause (which logically might have been the
inference) is introduced by 'u vai.'

<span id="fn_749"></span>[406:5](sbe4166.htm#fr_752.md) Sâya*n*a refers to
the legend in Taitt. S. II, I, 2, 2, here alluded to:--Svarbhânu, the
Âsura, struck the sun with darkness. The gods sought an expiation for
that (darkness): the first darkness of his which they dispelled became a
black ewe, the second a red one, the third a white one; and what they
cut off from the surface of the bone (?) that became a barren sheep, &c.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[407:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_753.md) Viz. inasmuch as
the fire to be ultimately deposited on the fire-altar was taken from the
original (hall-door) fire.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[407:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_754.md) See [VI, 1, 1,
9](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:9.md).

<span id="fn_752"></span>[407:3](sbe4166.htm#fr_755.md) That is,
Pra*g*âpati, the lord of procreation; see [VI, 1, 2,
6](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:6.md) seq.

<span id="fn_753"></span>[408:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_756.md) That is, having
rapidly muttered it.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[408:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_757) That is, (means of.md)
deliverance or removal, a term applied to the next five mantras.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[408:3](sbe4166.htm#fr_758.md) Lit. their burning
heat (*s*u*k*); cf. [par. 32](sbe4166.htm#7:5:2:32.md) seq.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[409:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_759.md) The Sacrificer
builds the fire-altar with a view to his securing for himself a place in
heaven.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[409:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_760.md) It is doubtful what
is meant here by this term, unless it be a monkey, or a counterfeit
human head; cf. [p. 197](sbe4134.htm#page_197.md), note
[4](sbe4134.htm#fn_405.md).

<span id="fn_758"></span>[410:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_761.md) This paraphrase
does not make it clear how the author construes and interprets this part
of the formula; especially in what sense he takes 'nishîda.'

<span id="fn_759"></span>[410:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_762.md) Thus Mahîdhara
(gauravar*n*a*m* m*ri*gam). In the St. Petersburg dictionary 'gaura' is
taken here in the sense of 'buffalo, bos gavæus.' The parallelism in the
next two formulas might indeed seem to point to that meaning.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[411:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_763.md) Viz. inasmuch as
its wool serves as a cover for man and beast.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[412:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_764.md) 'A*g*a,' he-goat,
is here again taken in the sense of 'a-*g*a,' unborn. As to the gods
having sprung from Vâ*k*, see [VI, 1, 2, 6](sbe4129.htm#6:1:2:6.md) seq.

<span id="fn_762"></span>[412:2](sbe4166.htm#fr_765.md) A fabulous animal
with eight legs.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[414:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_766.md) See [VI, 4, 4,
22](sbe4140.htm#6:4:4:22); [5, 1, 4](sbe4141.htm#6:5:1:4.md).

<span id="fn_764"></span>[417:1](sbe4166.htm#fr_767.md) The four sets of
bricks are placed in the middle of the four sides of the square 'body'
of the altar-site, or at the ends of the two spines' intersecting each
other.
