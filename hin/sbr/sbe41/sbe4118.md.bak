### FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:1">5:4:1:1</span></span>1. He
puts a piece of copper <span id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_184.md) into the
mouth of a long-haired man, with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 10), 'Removed by
sacrifice are the mordacious.' For verily he who performs the Râ*g*asûya
escapes all kinds of death, all murderous blows, and old age alone is
his death: hence whatever kind of death, whatever murderous blow there
is, past that he now guides him, as past the mordacious ones.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:2">5:4:1:2</span></span>2. And as
to why it is of a long-haired man,--such a long-haired man is neither
woman nor man; for being a male, he is not a woman, and being longhaired
(a eunuch), he is not a man. And copper (or bronze) is neither iron nor
gold; and those mordacious ones (snakes) are neither worms nor
non-worms. And as to its being copper,--reddish

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

to be sure are mordacious ones: therefore (he throws it in the face) of
a long-haired man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:3">5:4:1:3</span></span>3. He
then makes him ascend the regions, with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 10-14), 'Ascend
thou the East! May the Gâyatrî (metre) protect thee, the
Rathantara-sâman, the threefold stoma, the spring season, the
Priesthood, that precious treasure!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:4">5:4:1:4</span></span>4.
'Ascend thou the South! May the Trish*t*ubh protect thee, the
B*ri*hat-sâman, the fifteenfold stoma, the summer season, the
Knighthood, that precious treasure!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:5">5:4:1:5</span></span>5.
'Ascend thou the West! May the *G*agatî protect thee, the Vairûpa-sâman,
the seventeenfold stoma, the rainy season, the Peasantry, that precious
treasure!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:6">5:4:1:6</span></span>6.
'Ascend thou the North! May the Anush*t*ubh protect thee, the
Vairâ*g*a-sâman, the twenty-onefold stoma, the autumn season, fruit,
that precious treasure!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:7">5:4:1:7</span></span>7.
'Ascend thou the upper region! May the Paṅkti protect thee, the Sâkvara
and Raivata-sâmans, the thrice-ninefold and the three and thirtyfold
stomas, the winter and dewy season, spiritual lustre, that precious
treasure!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:8">5:4:1:8</span></span>8. And as
to why he makes him ascend the quarters,--that is a form of the seasons:
it is the seasons, the year, that he thereby makes him ascend; and
having ascended the seasons, the year, he is high, high above everything
here, and everything here is below him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:9">5:4:1:9</span></span>9. On the
hind part of the tiger's skin <span id="fr_185"></span>[1](#fn_185.md) a
piece of

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

lead is laid down. He kicks it off with his foot, with (Vâ*g*. S. X,
14), 'Kicked off is Namu*k*i's head!' Now there was once an Âsura,
Namu*k*i by name. Indra knocked him down, and trod with his foot upon
him. And in that he, thus trodden upon, bulged out, that (is the origin
of) a rupture. He tore off his head with his foot, and therefrom sprang
a goblin (Rakshas). That one kept calling out to him, 'Whither art thou
going? Where wilt thou rid thyself of me?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:10">5:4:1:10</span></span>10. He
beat it off with (a disk of) lead: hence lead is soft, for it has lost
its spring, as it beat off (the goblin) with all its might. Hence also,
while being like gold, it is not worth anything; for it has lost its
spring, as it beat off (the goblin) with all its might. And so, indeed,
he (Indra) thereby beat off the fiends, the Rakshas; and in like manner
this one (the king) thereby beats off the fiends, the Rakshas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:11">5:4:1:11</span></span>11. He
then makes him step upon the tiger's skin, with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 15), 'Thou
art Soma's beauty;'--For because when Soma flowed through Indra, he
(Indra) thereupon became a tiger, and therefore he is Soma's beauty:
this is why he says, 'Thou art Soma's beauty;'--'May my beauty be like
unto thine!'--The tiger's beauty he thereby bestows upon him: therefore
he says, 'May my beauty be like unto thine!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:12">5:4:1:12</span></span>12.
Below (the king's foot) he throws a (small) gold plate, with, 'Save
(him) from death!'--Gold is immortal life: he thus takes his stand on
immortal life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:13">5:4:1:13</span></span>13.
Then there is (another) gold plate, perforated either with a hundred, or
with nine, holes. If with

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

a hundred holes,--man here lives up to a hundred (years), and has a
hundred energies, a hundred powers; therefore it is perforated with a
hundred holes. And if with nine holes,--there are in man those nine
vital airs: therefore it is perforated with nine holes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:14">5:4:1:14</span></span>14.
That (gold plate) he lays upon his head, with, 'Might thou art, victory
thou art, immortality thou art!' Gold being immortal life, he thus lays
immortal life into him. And as to why there are gold plates on both
sides,--gold being immortal life,--he thus encloses him on both sides
with immortal life: this is why there are gold plates on both sides.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:15">5:4:1:15</span></span>15. He
then lifts up his arms, with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 16 <span
id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_186).md), 'Golden-bodied, ye two lords rise like
the sun: mount ye the chariot, O Mitra and Varu*n*a, and thence behold
Aditi and Diti!' Mitra and Varu*n*a verily are the two arms, and the
chariot (-seat) is the man: therefore he says, 'Mount ye the chariot, O
Mitra and Varu*n*a!'--'thence behold Aditi and Diti!' By this he means
to say, 'See ye your own (property) and that of others''

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:16">5:4:1:16</span></span>16. Let
him not lift up (the king's arms) with that one, but let him rather lift
them up with, 'Thou art Mitra, thou art Varu*n*a;' for Mitra-Varu*n*a
are the two arms, and by his arms the Râ*g*anya belongs to Mitra and
Varu*n*a: let him therefore lift up his arms with, 'Thou art Mitra, thou
art Varu*n*a.'

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:1:17">5:4:1:17</span></span>17. And
as to why he anoints him (standing) with upstretched arms;--those arms
in truth are the Râ*g*anya's power, and power also is that collected
essence of the waters wherewith he now anoints him: 'Lest that power,
the collected essence of the waters, weigh down (paralyze) this power of
mine, the arms,' thus he thinks, and therefore he anoints him (standing)
with upstretched arms.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_184"></span>[90:1](sbe4118.htm#fr_184.md) Lohâyasa, literally,
'red metal,' apparently either copper, or an alloy of copper and some
other metal,--The eunuch is sitting in the Sadas.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[91:1](sbe4118.htm#fr_185.md) This was spread out
in front of the Maitrâvaru*n*a's hearth, see [V, 3, 5,
3](sbe4117.htm#5:3:5:3.md).

<span id="fn_186"></span>[93:1](sbe4118.htm#fr_186.md) In *Ri*k S. V, 62, 8
the verse runs as follows:--At the glow of the dawn, at the rising of
the sun, ye, O Mitra and Varu*n*a, mount your golden-formed,
iron-pillared chariot; thence ye behold Aditi and Diti (? the boundless
space and the bounded).
