Now as soon as the completing oblation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_228"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of that Consecration-ceremony comes to an end,--</p>

<p>five lotus-flowers. That wreath of twelve lotus-flowers he puts on himself; that is the initiation: by that initiation he initiates himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:4:5:14">5:4:5:14</A></FONT></span>14. And as to why there are twelve (flowers),--there being twelve months in the year, and the year being All, it is by the All that he thus initiates him: what flowers there are of the lotus, they are a form (an image) of the sky, they are a form of the stars; and what seed-stalks there are, they are a form of the air; and what suckers there are, they are a form of this (earth): thus he initiates him (to rule) over these worlds.</p>

<p>tied him up in two parts, they drive him around. Having then placed one-half on the throne-seat, he proceeds therewith. Having then placed on the throne-seat that portion which was deposited in the Brahman's house, he proceeds with the guest-meal. Whilst he is proceeding with the guest-meal, he performs the Upasads. Whilst he is performing the Upasads,--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:4:5:16">5:4:5:16</A></FONT></span>16. He prepares those (three) oblations,--a cake on eight potsherds for Agni; a pap for Soma; and a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for Vish<I>n</I>u. Thus he performs the sacrifice in this way, if it pleases him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:4:5:17">5:4:5:17</A></FONT></span>17. But let him not do it in this way; for he who departs from the path of the sacrifice stumbles, and he who departs from the path of the Upasads certainly departs from the path of the sacrifice: let him therefore not depart from the path of the Upasads.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:4:5:18">5:4:5:18</A></FONT></span>18. Now when he offers to Agni, he steals along with Agni, with fiery spirit; and when he offers to Soma, he steals along with Soma, the King; and when he offers to Vish<I>n</I>u,--Vish<I>n</I>u being the sacrifice,--he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own (or, takes it in).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:4:5:19">5:4:5:19</A></FONT></span>19.

Twelve heifers with first calf are the sacrificial fee for this (sacrifice); for twelve months there are in the year, and the year is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:4:5:21">5:4:5:21</A></FONT></span>21. These (heifers) have twelve embryo calves,--that makes twenty-four; for twenty-four half-moons there are in the year, and the year is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:4:5:22">5:4:5:22</A></FONT></span>22. He gives them to the Brahman, for the Brahman guards the sacrifice from the south: therefore he gives them to the Brahman. To the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> (chanter) he gives the gold wreath, to the Hot<I>ri</I> the gold plate, to the two Adhvaryus two golden mirrors, to the Prastot<I>ri</I> (<A HREF="errata.htm#10">presenter</A>) a horse, to the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a a sterile cow, to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>kh</I>a<I>m</I>sin a bull, to the Nesh<I>t</I><I>ri</I> and Pot<I>ri</I> two garments, to the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka (a cart) laden with barley, and yoked (with an ox) on one side, to the Agn&icirc;dh an ox&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

It is in this way they are to move when they betake themselves to the respective fire-places for performing the sa<I>m</I>s<I>ri</I>p oblations; as they also do when betaking themselves to the Sadas to drink the cups of Soma at the Soma-feast on the next day. When libations of Soma-juice are made from the ten cups (<I>k</I>amasa, see part ii, p. 287), each cup is to be followed by ten Br&acirc;hmans who then take part in consuming the liquor in the Sadas--there being thus altogether one hundred Br&acirc;hmans taking part in these potations. The contents of the Sacrificer's cup, on the other hand, may be drunk by ten Ra<I>g</I>anyas (i.e. himself and nine others). See K&acirc;ty. XV, 8, 18-20; Taitt. S., vol. ii, p. 179.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_225"></A><A HREF="sbe4122.htm#fr_225">114:4</A> S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a takes this literally as meaning that he is to call out the name of the Sacrificer's grandfather, then the grandfather of that one and so on. The commentary on K&acirc;ty. XV, 8, 16, on the other hand, apparently takes it to mean ten forefathers of the Sacrificer who have performed Soma-sacrifices, from the grandfather upwards.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_226"></A><A HREF="sbe4122.htm#fr_226">114:5</A> That is, an excessive demand, or, a weighing down, or crushing of the Sacrificer, making it impossible for him to perform the ceremony at all.</P>

At the Da<I>s</I>apeya, the ten Sa<I>m</I>s<I>ri</I>p-oblations take as it were the place of the ordinary Upasads, the latter being performed on the last three preliminary days along with, and to the same deities as, the last three Sa<I>m</I>s<I>ri</I>p-oblations; or, according to some authorities, <A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A> being substituted for them. There seems also some difference of opinion as to the exact time when the other preliminary ceremonies--the procession and entrance of king Soma, the guest-meal, &amp;c.--are to take place, see <a href="sbe4122.htm#5:4:5:15">paragraph 15</A>.--According to K&acirc;ty. XV, 8,14, these ceremonies are to take place on the seventh day (which the commentator, however, takes to mean the seventh day of the light fortnight of <I>K</I>aitra; the first seven Sa<I>m</I>s<I>ri</I>p-oblations being, according to him, performed on the day before). The K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas, however, perform these offerings on separate days.--The Taittir&icirc;ya authorities seem also to be at variance with each other as to the exact relation of the Upasads and the last three Sa<I>m</I>s<I>ri</I>p-oblations, the deities of the two being, according to their scheme, only partly identical. According to &Acirc;pastamba (and Taitt. Br.) the first seven Sa<I>m</I>s<I>ri</I>ps are performed on so many days and, moreover, one D&icirc;ksh&acirc; on the seventh day. Then on the last three days the Sa<I>m</I>s<I>ri</I>ps and Upasads are combined in this way, that the eighth day's Sa<I>m</I>s<I>ri</I>p is performed previous to, the ninth between, the tenth after the two daily Upasad-performances.--Each of the ten oblations also requires a special set of fires for its performance, the first being laid down immediately north of the one used for the Abhishe<I>k</I>an&icirc;ya ceremony, the second immediately north of the first, &amp;c.; the last Sa<I>m</I>s<I>ri</I>p-oblation being performed in the fire-shed (<I>s</I>&acirc;l&acirc;) of the Da<I>s</I>apeya proper.
