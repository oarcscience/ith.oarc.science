### The Century of Verses.

There is no known comparison in all the three worlds for the venerable
teacher that bestows knowledge. If the philosopher's stone be assumed as
such, it only turns iron into gold, but, alas! cannot convert it into
philosopher's stone. The venerable teacher, on the other hand, creates
equality with himself in the disciple that takes refuge in his feet. He
is therefore peerless, nay, even transcendental. (1)

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

Just as, by virtue of the fragrance diffused by a sandal tree, other
trees around it are also full of fragrance at all times and afford
shelter from heat to diverse beings, so do they that have derived wisdom
from the teacher, with hearts full of mercy, emancipate, by their
teachings, all those who are fortunate enough to stand in their
presence, from the three kinds of misery <span
id="fr_62"></span>[\*](#fn_57.md) and the three kinds of sin. <span
id="fr_63"></span>[†](#fn_58) (2.md)

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

At the outset is enunciated the perception of the self and of the
not-self by means, respectively, of true knowledge and illusion. Thus
does scripture speak of the knowledge of Brahman as two-fold, namely, by
means of experience relating to oneself (*svânubhûti*) and by conclusive
certainty (*upapatti*). The former arises in correlation to bodily
limitation, while the latter arises out of universality; at first
springs up the experience "I am Brahman", and then "All this is
Brahman." (3)

The nature of the self is consciousness. knowledge and bliss. It can be
known by direct realisation. It. is the inspiring soul in all bodies,
(senses), etc. And yet, the utterly ignorant person mistakes the
transient body for the soul, although he knows again and

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

again that the body, whether his own or another's, is externally
composed of bones, tendon, marrow, flesh, blood, nerves, skin and fat,
and internally full of ordure, urine and phlegm. (4)

All these beings spend the whole of their valuable life-time on earth as
followers of the philosophy of the flesh, imagining: "The body, wife,
sons, friends, servants, horses, cattle,—these are the sources of my
happiness." They fail to understand that inner, immortal Lord of Life,
by whom they live, by whom they are rendered fit for the duties of life
and by whom they are endowed with prosperity. (5)

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

Just as a sagacious insect (e, g., the silkworm) builds, by its own
efforts, a cocoon around itself and, jointly therewith, moves about
throughout its life in the discharge of its activities, so does the
individual soul, by means of the fruits of various actions, build up a
physical body and, remaining therein, move about along with it, day by
day, on earth. (6)

Does a person who assumes the mask of a tiger for his livelihood and
frightens the young ones, injure any man, beast or other living being,
under the impression that he is a tiger? Or, does the actor, playing a
woman s part, pant for a husband, imagining himself to be a woman? So is
the self conditioned by

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

the body, but, being different from the body and from experience, is
only the witness. (7)

Just as a mother, in order to pacify her child that has been weeping for
a very long time, places before it a grape, a date, a mango, or a good
plantain fruit, so well has the upanishad, by various teaching
expedients, enlightened the utterly ignorant mind that wanders
restlessly in consequence of the faculty of delusion acquired in
numerous lives. (8)

That self, by reason of which being dear, all things like the body,
wife, children and

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

wealth, are dear, must itself be dearer than those things. Those things,
on the other hand, are sources of misery. How, then, can they be dearer
(than the self)? For the sake of saving one's own life, one gives up
even his wife and others, and, for the good of one's own. self, one
gives up even one's own body. The wise should therefore cherish the self
as the most beloved and not anything else. (9)

As long as one derives pleasure from an object, so long is it beloved;
and as long as it gives rise. to pain, so long is it disliked. Neither
pleasantness nor unpleasantness resides at all times in the same object.
Sometimes what is unpleasant might become pleasant, and what is very
pleasant might become unpleasant.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The reality known
as the self is, therefore; the most beloved at all times. (10)

What is preferable in the world and what is pleasant are each said to be
of two kinds, namely, that which is actuated by desire and that which is
absolute. That which is actuated by desire is the sole source of sorrow
and becomes insipid in an instant; it is sought after by the ignorant.
Brahman alone is the absolute, being the repository of unsurpassed
bliss; therein do they that know the truth take refuge. This is declared
in the six divisions (*vallî*) of the Kathopanishad. (11)

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

Feeling, while going about, that he is a wave of the ocean of the self:
while sitting, that he is a bead strung on the thread of universal
consciousness: while perceiving objects of sense, that he is realising
himself by perceiving the self: and, while sleeping, that he is drowned
in the ocean of bliss;—he who, inwardly constant, spends his whole life
thus, is, among all men, the real seeker of liberation. (12)

All this world, consisting of name and form, is only the particular
manifestation (*vyaskti*) of the universal -Substance (*virâj*); it
moves

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

and knows all objects by virtue of the primal life (*mukhya-prâna*) that
inspires it. This self, like the sun, is neither the doer nor the
enjoyer.—Thus, directly realising, does he that is full of knowledge and
realisation live his life, through incessant contemplation of the
supreme self. (13)

Non-attachment (*vairâgya*) is declared to be of two kinds, namely, that
which springs from disgust (*nirveda*) and that which is inspired by
knowledge. The former arises from the observation that desires, such as
for home or friends or sons or wealth, generally end in sorrow; while
the latter is the rejection of the above-mentioned things, by virtue of
the wisdom imparted, as if they were vomitted matter. Renunciation too
is of two kinds for those of

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

subdued mind, namely, that of the body and that of the home. (14)

Every one in all the three worlds strives for happiness and not at all
fur misery. The two sources of misery are the sense of I-ness in the
body and the sense of mine-ness, arising therefrom, in the objects of
one's own consciousness; for, even the learned man undergoes suffering
from disease or assault by mistaking the transient body for the self,
and experiences extreme sorrow at the loss of wife, son or wealth, but
not at the loss of an enemy. <span id="fr_64"></span>[\*](#fn_59) (15.md)

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

Although dwelling in the house as the head of the family, he who is
devoid of the feeling of mine-ness remains therein like a guest longing
to reach his destination, <span id="fr_65"></span>[\*](#fn_60.md) and feels
not, with fervour, the happiness or the misery residing in the body.
What must happen, whether it be the body or anything else, will surely
happen, and what must be lost, will surely be lost, like the gathering
of clouds. He who knows this truth remains at ease. (16)

He who, by strength of will, escapes from his own home like a snake out
of its slough, might occasionally attend to the sustenance of his body
like a traveller resorting to the shade

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

of a wayside tree, but should only beg of trees so much food, in the
shape of fruits fallen of their own accord, as would be enough to
appease his hunger. He should also go forth from his body in order to
enter the garden of his own self that is full of bliss. (17)

There first arises, in the mind, desire. It then directs the mind to
various objects. The mind then grasps those objects through the medium
of the senses. When an object is not attained, there springs up anger.
When an object is attained, there arises greed in the shape of eagerness
to preserve that object. These three are the cause of every one's ruin.
The .wise should therefore shun them by constant meditation upon the
self. (18)

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

That is a gift which is made by men as a dedication to Brahman; patience
is the absence of anger; faith is the belief in the existence of the
self; and the reality is Brahman (*sat*). The four opposites of these
are known as the barriers (*setu*), and tend to the bondage of every
being. One should therefore overcome these barriers by means of the four
gifts, etc., aforesaid, and should thereby attain happiness,
immortality, heavenward progress, and the realisation of the light. (19)

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

Food that is dedicated to the Lord and to guests tends to immortality;
otherwise, the food is useless. So, too, food that is cooked for one's
own sake is said to be one's death. He, too, among men, who eats by
himself becomes wholly sinful in this world. And he, too, who eats daily
without the prescribed consecration of the food to the fire of life,
remains a mortal. (20)

He alone, in the world, is the giver who offers food to the famished
mendicant that comes to his house. To such an one there is plenty of
food for sacrifice, and he becomes one that has no enemy. He, on the
other hand, who does not offer food even to the friend that has
constantly served him with attachment for the sake of food, is not a

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

friend. From such a miser one should be anxious to turn away, as it
were, out of disregard. (21)

The manifestation and the dissolution of the universe have, for their
respective cause, the ignorance or the knowledge of the self, and are
applicable to all beings from the creator (*hiranya-garbha*)
downwards,—so do the Vedas declare. When the self is realised, the
universe is sacrificed <span id="fr_66"></span>[\*](#fn_61.md) into
Brahman, and, when the self is not realised, this Brahman is again
sacrificed <span id="fr_67"></span>[\*](#fn_61.md) into the universe, in
the same way as the (illusory) silver disappears into the
mother-of-pearl and the real substance (the

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

mother-of-pearl) into the (illusory) silver owing Ito the
non-recognition of each of them in turn. (22)

Then was not non-entity, that being absolutely non-existent like the
sky-flower; nor was then any entity that could divide. But something
then was, different from these two. Then was not the universe as it
(now) exists in its phenomenal condition; and yet it already existed
differently, as the (illusory) silver already exists in the
mother-of-pearl. Nor was then the primordial (cosmic) substance
(*virât*) sprung from ether. For, what is there, like unto the water
produced by magic, that can veil the unconditioned self? <span
id="fr_68"></span>[\*](#fn_62) (23.md)

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

If there was no bondage in the shape of origin and dissolution, neither
was there liberation; just as there is neither night nor day in the sun,
for, it is only a limitation of vision. The One, motionless and
unconditioned, then became, by its own power of illusion (*mâyâ*), that
which is known as the maker (*kartri*) <span
id="fr_69"></span>[\*](#fn_63.md). And there was naught else than that.
That alone, veiled by the unborn <span id="fr_70"></span>[†](#fn_64.md),
became the individual soul. (24)

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

In the beginning was darkness, <span id="fr_71"></span>[\*](#fn_65.md) as
an entity. Thus veiled by darkness, naught could then be seen, like the
water that is contained-in milk. The birth of this universe, consisting
of name and form, was by virtue of the will of the Creator desiring to
create,—this will being induced by the actions (*karma-bhih*) of a
continuous (*anugata*) universe constantly inspired by minds that are
also continuous in a germinal form. (25)

This (goddess of) illusion (*mâyâ*) has four crests <span
id="fr_72"></span>[†](#fn_66.md). She is always fresh and therefore ever
young. She is skilful, because she is an expert in accomplishing even
the impossible. She is sweet-mouthed <span id="fr_73"></span>[‡](#fn_67.md)
at the outset. Thus,

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

too, she veils the knowledge derivable from the *upanishads*. In her
dwell, like two birds, the supreme self and the individual soul, for,
they alone make all things manifest. (26)

Of these two, the former remains unattached, while the latter, on the
other hand, falling into the ocean of ignorance and forgetting the real
nature of the self, perceived the apparition of these various worlds.
But no sooner has he turned his consciousness within himself than the
unborn (*mâyâ*), abandons him and he abandons her. There is, thus, One
only. But the wise, somehow, render that One variously by their
teachings. <span id="fr_74"></span>[\*](#fn_68) (27.md)

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

The inner self neither comes in at the time of birth nor goes away at
the time of death; for, it is infinite. But it is the mind with the
subtle body that enters thus and goes forth afterwards. The mind does
not reproduce in itself the leanness or the stoutness of the gross body.
But it departs, taking with it the two sets <span
id="fr_75"></span>[\*](#fn_69) of tendencies (*samskâra*.md) and the
measures of light (*tejo-mâtrâh*) <span id="fr_76"></span>[†](#fn_70.md),
and returns again to this world along with these very appendages. (28)

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

There was, of old, a venerable Brâhmaṇa, named Subandhu, who was the
priest of (king) Sanâti; he having died by the deceitful incantations of
some Brâhmaṇas, his mind went to (the abode of the god of) death, and
his brother brought it back by means of Vedic hymns,—so says the Veda.
It follows from this that the mind alone, as related to the self, goes
forth and not the inner self in any case. (29)

The one motionless self moves with the wandering mind, remains in it,
and is also both before and behind it. But although it is

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

thus present throughout, the eye and other senses know it not. Water,
for instance, moves about with the rolling waves raised by the wind, is
in them and before them and behind them; and when the waves are still,
it is as it ever is. (30)

The inner self was, at first, by itself. Then it seeks objects of
enjoyment one after another: "Let me have wife and
[children](errata.htm#4.md) and wealth to support them." For their sake the
man works with very many difficulties even at the risk of his life and
does not deem anything-else to be higher or greater than them. Even if
any one of them is not gained, he feels himself to be incomplete and is
as inactive as if he were dead; so, too, even if any one of them is
lost, he feels he has entirely missed his purpose. (31)

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

The cloud that hides the huge sun leas not existed (ever) before nor
will exist (ever) thereafter, but is visible only during that interval.
And it obstructs the vision of the spectator and not the solar orb; for,
if it were not so, how can the group of clouds be visible without the
sun? In this manner does the universe (*visva*) <span
id="fr_77"></span>[\*](#fn_71.md) veil the understanding and not the
supreme (self) that is its <span id="fr_78"></span>[†](#fn_72.md) own
illuminer and inspirer. (32)

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

Having, in dream, ruled a kingdom with all the glories thereof, one does
not, on waking thereafter, feel sorry that he has lost his kingdom,
knowing, as he does, that it was unreal. Nor does one become liable to
punishment by committing adultery or other evil deed in dream. So will
it be, if one should forget all the activities of his waking state like
dreams. (33)

The pleasure or pain experienced in the dream-state becomes unreal on
waking, and the objects towards which the activities of the physical
body are directed in the waking state become unreal during sleep. But,
although unreality is thus established in both ways, the ignorant person
still clings to it <span id="fr_79"></span>[\*](#fn_73.md), although its

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

illuminer is the self (*satya*). Surely, we are not aware why this
should be so. (34)

One is filled with sudden grief on seeing the death, in one's dream, of
a relation that lives in one's waking state. So, too, does one feel
happy by seeing alive, in dream, one that was dead in the waking state.
And although one remembers (in dream) the death or the life of the
individual (in one's waking condition), he nevertheless converses with
him. This being so, reality or unreality depends only on the length or
shortness of time. <span id="fr_80"></span>[\*](#fn_74) (35.md)

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

Although the pleasure of meeting a woman in dream is extremely unreal,
yet the discharge resulting therefrom is visible. In the same way does
the universe appear as almost real although it has sprung from
unreality. The man in the (above) dream may be real, but the woman and
her company are only unreal, and yet the cloth is actually soiled in the
morning by the discharge. All this universe, therefore, has imagination
(*kalpanâ*) <span id="fr_81"></span>[\*](#fn_75.md) for its root-cause.
(36)

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

All persons witness the sport of this (self) every day in the
dream-state, and yet no one sees that (self) itself sporting with
illusion (*mâyâ*) without any of the organs of sense <span
id="fr_82"></span>[\*](#fn_76.md). Nor does any one realise it, in the
waking state, as the illuminer of all objects and the inspirer of all
creatures, nor, in deep sleep, as that which is full of supreme bliss.
This is wonderful! (37)

The revelation of a sacred word (*mantra*) heard in dream becomes real
on waking; and as the result of a benediction in dream, the desired
object is actually attained in the morning. Thus the real may spring up
even from the unreal. <span id="fr_83"></span>[†](#fn_77.md) Further, that
(self) alone is self-resplendent by which are manifested all

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

animate and inanimate things, the entire variety of perceivable objects,
nay, the whole universe itself. (38).

In deep sleep, fire, the sun and others <span
id="fr_84"></span>[\*](#fn_78.md) are merged in the medial life
(*madhya-prâna* <span id="fr_85"></span>[†](#fn_79).md) which is their
source, and speech and others in the life-breath. Therefore is it
declared that the cessation is of these senses and not of the breath.
The appearance of objects through those senses (in the waking state) is
known to be an illusion like that of silver in the ṃother-of-pearl. The
practice of the control of life-forces enunciated in the Vedanta is
therefore the only means of realising one's own self and not any
other. <span id="fr_86"></span>[‡](#fn_80) (39.md).

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

Fire does not touch wet fuel even exceptionally, but only fuel that has
been dried in the sun. So, too, the fire of knowledge does not touch the
mind that is wet with attachments although it has acquired merit by the
performance of prescribed duties, the preservation of progeny and gifts
of wealth, but only the mind that is dried by non-attachment. Therefore
is pure non-attachment taught foremost, for, by it is the success of
realisation. (40).

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

Whatever is of the nature of name and form, whatever moves in this
world, springs up as a mere unreality and should be veiled off by the
Lord by whom it is manifest and by whom it is multifariously active, in
the same way as the (illusory) snake is veiled off by the rope that is
definitely known. (Only) by abandoning that (unreality) can unsurpassed
bliss be enjoyed. Do not therefore covet any other thing like wealth,
etc. (41).

To the aspirant for liberation there first comes liberation while living
and then ultimate liberation. These two are the result of constant
practice and realisation, which are only attainable by the contact of
the teacher's feet and his merciful glance. Practice, too, is of two
kinds according to qualification, namely, bodily and mental. Bodily
practice consists

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

of postures (*âsana*), etc., while the other, previously explained as
the path of knowledge, consists of abstention (*uparati*). (42).

Having rooted out all desires abiding in the heart as if their pegs were
forcibly broken, he loses all attachment to the body and gives up his
waywardness, his attention being wholly given to the self. Then will he
of accumulated merit reach the highest abode <span
id="fr_87"></span>[\*](#fn_81.md) which is variegated by dark, white and
red veins <span id="fr_88"></span>[†](#fn_82.md) and wherein ambrosia flows
in plenty, and enjoy the bliss of the self. (43).

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

Such a person, while in this body, passes beyond sorrow, ignorance and
other impediments and sees the universe as the self. <span
id="fr_89"></span>[\*](#fn_83.md) He then attains the shining Brahman <span
id="fr_90"></span>[†](#fn_84.md) and becomes all-knowing and the repository
of all occult powers. Afterwards, losing all sense of the gross, subtle
and other bodies and devoid of all volition, he attains the fourth
state <span id="fr_91"></span>[‡](#fn_85.md), and, purged of all merit and
demerit, attains liberation even in this life. <span
id="fr_92"></span>[§](#fn_86) (44.md).

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

As a result of such realisation of the self, there springs up the
youthful life <span id="fr_93"></span>[\*](#fn_87.md) which, although
encased in a body and the senses, is unaffected by boyhood, old age and
other bodily attributes, and is extremely blissful and capable of
accomplishing the highest goal. It is this life <span
id="fr_94"></span>[†](#fn_88.md) that is led up <span
id="fr_95"></span>[‡](#fn_89.md), along with the purified consciousness, by
those of supreme wisdom and unfailing resolution, who seek to become
divine by spiritual practices. (45).

Such a one is almost without desire, for temptations have lost all power
over him. He pants only for the realisation of the self for

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

the sake of its unsurpassed bliss. When he realises the self, he has
attained all his desires, <span id="fr_96"></span>[\*](#fn_90.md) and,
remains in the final condition. <span id="fr_97"></span>[†](#fn_91.md) When
the body dies, the life-breaths do not rise therefrom <span
id="fr_98"></span>[‡](#fn_92.md), but are gradually dissolved in their
respective causes. Then, where will the individual soul be, for it will
be merged, like salt in water, and is then the Infinite Self itself?
(46).

Water taken from the sea, when solidified, goes by the name of salt.
When it is thrown back into the sea and is dissolved, it loses its name
and form. So does the individual soul merge into the Supreme Self. At
the same time, the mind is dissolved into the moon,

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

speech into fire, sight into the sun, blood and semen into water and
hearing into the directions. (47).

Just as butter is contained in milk as indicated by the sweetness of the
latter, but (when extracted) becomes separate therefrom, so too is
Brahman in every being as indicated by the activity of the being. This
(Brahman) is the cause of rest when one is tired. <span
id="fr_99"></span>[\*](#fn_93.md) Attaining it, one discards all other gain
as straw. Therein springs up no fear. The concentrated bliss which thus
glows within oneself is immortality. All else is transient. (48).

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

The many-coloured cloth is woven, crosswise and lengthwise, of threads
of many colours. When this is understood, there remains nothing of the
cloth but the threads. So is the manifold universe, with its mountains,
cities, men, villages, beasts, etc., pervaded through and through, by
the primordial substance <span id="fr_100"></span>[\*](#fn_94.md), that
again by ether, and the latter by Brahman. (49).

This (Brahman), by virtue of its reflection by various objects <span
id="fr_101"></span>[†](#fn_95.md), assumes the various corresponding forms,
in the same way as the one seer produces a second one (by reflection)

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

in water. The Veda too speaks thus of the all-pervading Brahman: "The
resplendent one with its powers of illusion, has infinite forms on all
sides." The Brahman, therefore, becomes the individual soul by its
accidental reflection in the extremely clear consciousness. (50).

The knowers of the self discover, by their wisdom, that the individual
soul, <span id="fr_102"></span>[\*](#fn_96.md) besmeared by illusion, is
only a ray of the omnipotent Supreme Self reflected in the ocean of
consciousness. This Brahman is variously reflected in accordance with
the form and measure of the medium reflecting it, in the same way that
the face is variously reflected corresponding

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

to the mirror in hand; but it is at all times what it ever is. <span
id="fr_103"></span>[\*](#fn_97) (51.md).

Just as the one sun, independent of other objects, yet, by virtue of
reflection in several waters, becomes <span
id="fr_104"></span>[†](#fn_98.md) many and has the same stability or motion
as the medium reflecting it; so does the Supreme Self seem to be
affected by properties <span id="fr_105"></span>[‡](#fn_99.md) by virtue of
its reflection in all beings, high and low, but, when clearly realised,
shines unaffected by those properties. (52)

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

Just as the rays of the sun reflected by the moon or focussed by a
metallic reflector dispel the utter darkness of the night or of the
(interior of the) house as the case may be, so do the rays of the
Supreme Self reflected by the consciousness and streaming forth through
the outlets of the senses, immediately reveal to us the objects of
perception around us, such as forms, etc. (53)

The Supreme Self has three aspects, namely, the full, the self and the
not-self, the first being the unconditioned Self, the second being that
which is conditioned <span id="fr_106"></span>[\*](#fn_100.md) by the
consciousness,

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

and the third being a mere reflection, in the same way as space has
three aspects in respect of water, namely, that which is (everywhere)
inside and outside of the water, that Which is conterminous with the
water, and that which is reflected therein. When the conditioned self is
merged in the unconditioned, then the condition <span
id="fr_107"></span>[\*](#fn_101.md) together with its consequences <span
id="fr_108"></span>[†](#fn_102) vanishes altogether. (54.md)

Just as countless wooden figures of women, acted upon by means of posts
and strings, simultaneously exhibit music and all other activities of
common occurrence <span id="fr_109"></span>[‡](#fn_103.md), so does the
world, including the regions of *bhûr*, *bhuvar*, *svar* and *mahar*,
carry on all its activities by the inspiration of what is known as the

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

*sûtra-âtman* <span id="fr_110"></span>[\*](#fn_104.md), which pervades
everything, whose potency is unique and whose inspiration is in
proportion to the end to be achieved. (55).

That is real which is unaffected at all times. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[†](#fn_105.md) Such are the unembodied things like
life, space, ether. Even these ultimately resolve themselves <span
id="fr_112"></span>[‡](#fn_106.md) into Brahman; hence is Brahman the
reality of the real. There is naught else which excels it in its
transcendentality or its infinitude; therefore is it termed the reality
of the real. The lower <span id="fr_113"></span>[§](#fn_107.md) that is
conditioned by embodied and unembodied things is called satya <span
id="fr_114"></span>[\*\*](#fn_108.md), because it is both *sat* and
*tyat*. <span id="fr_115"></span>[¶](#fn_109.md) Of this too, Brahman is
the reality. (56).

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

Whatever unreal thing is, in every-day experience, perceived, like
silver (in mother-of-pearl), serpent (in rope) and water (in mirage),
depends for its perception on the real. This rule, with its
limitation <span id="fr_116"></span>[\*](#fn_110.md), is well-established.
So has this whole universe sprung into existence in <span
id="fr_117"></span>[†](#fn_111.md) Brahman, the reality of the real. That
too is called the real by virtue of which the unreal becomes an object
of perception. (57).

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

The material Brahman <span id="fr_118"></span>[\*](#fn_112.md), known as
*virat*, is such that the expanse of space, time, and the farthest
extremities of the directions, are but infinitesimal parts thereof, and
yet it appears to be so close at hand and face to face. From that arose
the *sûtra-âtman* <span id="fr_119"></span>[†](#fn_113.md), greater than
the great, fuller than the full, in the same way as the commingled water
of the (seven) oceans <span id="fr_120"></span>[‡](#fn_114.md) is fuller
than the full ocean, etc. <span id="fr_121"></span>[§](#fn_115) (58.md).

Just as the one rain-water inside all herbs is transformed variously
according to the numberless tastes, odours, properties and effects of
the respective herbs, so is the inner self <span
id="fr_122"></span>[\*\*](#fn_116.md) according

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

to the characteristics of the various kinds, of beings. By (virtue of)
it does the earth support all creatures, the clouds rain profusely, fire
cooks and burns. Hence is that the inner (self) of all. (59)

One should clearly realise the self in all beings and all successive
multitudes of created beings in the self. He should, repeatedly and
persistently, perceive all things as the self, having, for an example,
the relation between water and waves. <span
id="fr_123"></span>[\*](#fn_117.md) There is only one Brahman without a
second, as is declared by the Vedânta. The many do not in any way exist.
But he who sees this universe as manifold passes from death to
death. <span id="fr_124"></span>[†](#fn_118) (60.md)

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

In spite of the knowledge that the atmosphere exists all around the pot,
there arises in men the false impression that it has its origin along
with the pot, disappears when the pot is broken, moves with the pot when
it is removed elsewhere, and assumes the same size and shape as the pot.
So is the self in respect of the universe. (61).

As much as is a lump of sugar, so much is nothing but sweetness. As much
as a piece of camphor melts, so much is nothing but

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

sweet fragrance. So, too, as far as the universe is manifest, with all
the beauty of trees, mountains, cities, gardens and temples, so far does
the one (pure) consciousness shine forth, for, in the end all that
remains of the universe is the self. (62).

Although the hearing of the sound proceeds from the musical instrument,
it is nevertheless produced only by striking the instrument. The sounds
that proceed from striking the instrument are not heard separately but
only in conjunction with the striking. So, too, this universe, whose
efficient cause is illusion (*mâyâ*), is manifest, as it were, in
conjunction with Brahman. But when that Brahman is inwardly realised,
nothing will remain the object of perception. (63).

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

It is thus clearly seen that the Lord of all the worlds is of the nature
of pure consciousness, is the one Immovable that is knowledge itself, is
all-pervading like ether, and is the inner spirit of all beings. It is
also seen that all this universe is different from Brahman, is unreal by
nature, and is a mere semblance. One should, therefore, even now and
here, give up all desires and remain for ever fixed in the thought "I am
Brahman". (64).

When Indra and Indrânî have freely enjoyed the bliss of union, the
cessation of their pleasure

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

is deep sleep. <span id="fr_125"></span>[\*](#fn_119.md) Therein is a state
that is fall of concentrated bliss and very difficult to comprehend;
that is the *ânanda-kôsa* (the bliss-sheath). In that condition one is
not conscious of anything, being deeply merged in unsurpassed bliss. If
awaked, he becomes unhappy. A wise man should therefore never awake a
sleeping person. (65)

All beings <span id="fr_126"></span>[†](#fn_120.md) enjoy bliss by
attaining Brahman (*yasas*) which embraces within itself the eye and
other sensory organs and which externally helps all perception. All
individual souls are alike in nature as in deep sleep. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[‡](#fn_121.md) Among

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

these, he who, for the sake of feeding the belly, remains only
externally active and is enslaved by the senses of touch, sight,
hearing, smell and taste, becomes tainted with sin and suffers misery
and confusion. (66).

The individual soul, during the waking state, puts forth innumerable
efforts for the attainment of sensual pleasures, and when the entire
group of sensory organs is fatigued, it forgets even the pleasure on
hand and goes into sleep, in order that it may enjoy rest in its own
nature. Ultra-sensual bliss is thus extremely easy of attainment and is
far superior to the pleasure derived from the senses which always
produces disgust in the end. (67).

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

The bird, by the motion of its wings, generates a breeze and, by its
aid, reaches a great height, and there, having attained the vast expanse
of the atmosphere, cures itself of its fatigue by spreading its wings.
So, too, this mind, troubled by many evil desires and doubts in respect
of objects of pleasure, and fatigued thereby, stretches forth the hands
and feet and sleeps long for the sake of rest. (68).

The moment that the individual soul comes into union with the self
(Brahman) <span id="fr_128"></span>[\*](#fn_122.md), it ceases to be
conscious of anything, internal or external, like unto a lover fervently
embracing his

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

beloved one on his return home from a foreign land. In that state all
[worldly](errata.htm#5.md) activity that is the result of merit and
demerit, disappears, and nothing is remembered of all these ups and
downs,—sorrow, confusion, or fear. (69).

The disappearance of all gross and subtle existence, the cessation of
the senses, and the attainment of bliss,—these three are common to
liberation-while-alive and deep sleep. There is however this difference
that, whereas he who is asleep comes back to life again and again <span
id="fr_129"></span>[\*](#fn_123.md) by virtue of the effects of his past
actions, he that has attained illumination and liberation, never comes
back (to worldly life), because the effects of all his past actions have
been destroyed. (70).

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

If the bliss of a king endowed with all prosperity and enjoying every
kind of happiness be taken as a unit, the bliss of the *manes* is
declared to be a hundredfold. So, too, through the world of the gods
higher and higher up to the world of Brahman, each (bliss) is a
hundredfold of the next lower one. Singular and containing within itself
all these (grades of bliss) is the bliss of (the supreme) Brahman, of
which the pleasures of the senses are but an (insignificant) fraction.
(71).

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

"Therein are included all degrees of bliss,—the bliss of men (*ânanda*),
of the manes (*moda*), of gods (*pramoda*), etc. Therein all desires are
fulfilled. Therein is the state of oneness owing to the cessation of all
(phenomena). Make me live immortally for ever, O Soma <span
id="fr_130"></span>[\*](#fn_124.md), in that abode of concentrated bliss,
and vouchsafe to my soul <span id="fr_131"></span>[†](#fn_125.md) that is
betwixt the brows an unceasing shower of immortality, <span
id="fr_132"></span>[‡](#fn_126)"—so do the Vedas declare. (72.md).

The self is unperturbed and its nature is bliss; the other (*mâyâ*) is
quite the opposite; their steadiness or perturbation bears fruit in the
individual consciousness. The perturbation of the mind, until a desired
object is gained,

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

gives rise to misery. When that object is-gained, the pleasure (said to
be) derived from that object is only so long as the mind remains steady.
(73)

Just as there is a momentary bliss when the mind is absorbed in pleasure
at the end of a sensual indulgence, so too there is unsurpassed bliss in
deep sleep only so long as there is steadiness (of consciousness). In
liberation, however, the consciousness is absolutely tranquil and there
is eternal bliss. There is thus a constant relation between bliss and
steadiness. It is therefore proper to speak of sensual pleasure as a
fraction of eternal bliss. (74).

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

The mind, tired of external activities, draws them all in together, and
carrying with it the tendencies resulting from them, ceases from them
and turns inward in search of its own place. In the dream-body, it
enjoys dream-objects generated by the combination of those tendencies.
Abandoning these, again, it longs for the inner self, reaching which it
attains perfect rest. <span id="fr_133"></span>[\*](#fn_127) (75.md).

 <span id="fr_134"></span>[†](#fn_128.md) "How is the enjoyment of
pleasure, etc. possible in dream, while the instrument therefor

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the gross body)
is inert? If (it be said that) a new dream-body fit for such activity
springs up, wherefrom does it arise, since the means of its
generation <span id="fr_135"></span>[\*](#fn_129.md) is absent? If it be a
product of the imagination, then how is it that, after the experience of
sexual pleasure in a dream, the effect thereof is (actually) visible in
the body that is inert? (76).

"It is with this (the gross body) that he weeps from fear, talks, laughs
and exults." It <span id="fr_136"></span>[†](#fn_130.md) surely follows
from this that the inner self does not abruptly sever its connection
with the body during dream, although that body is inert; but, with the
help of the subtle body, it creates again, in subtle form, those objects

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

which it had previously <span id="fr_137"></span>[\*](#fn_131.md)
experienced, such as the body, woman, horse, tiger, locality, etc. (77).

The second state, that of dream, is known by experience to be midway
between waking and sleep. In that state the individual, having withdrawn
all the senses, has only the light of the self remaining. The gross body
having been laid down on a suitable bed, the inner self, experiencing
the objects it likes in their subtle form, goes about as it pleases in
the same manner. <span id="fr_138"></span>[†](#fn_132) (78.md).

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

Preserving the body lying in bed by means of the life-forces now reduced
to mere breath, lest it assume the form of a corpse and become food for
dogs, etc., it creates, in dream, by its own power, horses, chariots,
rivers, ponds, playgrounds, companions, women, sons, friends,—all by way
of imitation. <span id="fr_139"></span>[\*](#fn_133) (79.md).

It creates elephants, tigers, robbers, enemies, snakes and monkeys.
Sometimes it is playing with beloved damsels. Sometimes it laughs and
sports. Sometimes it eats delicious food. At other times it is afraid of
its kith and kin, because it has become an outcaste. And at other times
it runs away for fear of tigers, etc. or is caught by them and wails.
(80).

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

Whatever object is perceived, it comes into existence then and there by
the ignorance of the true nature of the self that is in it. Its
manifestation is like the unreal appearance of false silver owing to
one's not recognising the mother-of-pearl, or of the mirage owing to
one's not recognising the sun's rays, or of the serpent by one's not
recognising the rope,—such appearance giving rise to joy or fear, only
for an instant. Hence all this universe is really created by
perception. <span id="fr_140"></span>[\*](#fn_134) (81.md).

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

The Lord of the Universe has declared: "By me, on whom depends the
illusion of *mâyâ* all this (universe) has been spread forth. Therefore,
all things are in me, not I in them; for instance, although silver
appears (falsely) in the mother-o’-pearl, there is naught of the
mother-o’-pearl in silver. Therefore, <span
id="fr_141"></span>[\*](#fn_135) too, all things do not (in reality.md)
exist in me." It follows from this that the whole objective world is as
unreal as the products of jugglery. (82).

Action is the only cause of happiness or misery in this world. The
ignorant, not knowing this, speak in vain of friend or enemy. <span
id="fr_142"></span>[†](#fn_136.md) Yágṇavalkya, and Ártabhága of yore, in
the palace of king Janaka, spoke only

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

of action and praised it. Even the ornament <span
id="fr_143"></span>[\*](#fn_137.md) of the race of Yadu declares: "None in
this world remains without action." (83).

Although the axe is able to fell a tree, it should nevertheless be
wielded by a living being. Food is, no doubt, a source of satisfaction,
but the real cause thereof is the effort <span
id="fr_144"></span>[†](#fn_138.md) of the eater. In the same way, former
action is the cause of the good or evil results experienced; yet, being
itself evanescent, it cannot do this by itself. It is impelled thereto
by the inner self. (84).

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

The Vedas declare, with much propriety, that all rites, compulsory,
discretionary, and so on, which are laid down by the Smriti for the
various castes and conditions of men, are (in reality) dedicated to the
Supreme Self <span id="fr_145"></span>[\*](#fn_139.md); in the same way
that, by the satisfaction of the nose, eyes, tongue, hands, feet, head
and ears, it is the inner man that is actually satisfied, and, by the
watering of the roots of a tree, every part of that tree is nourished.
(85).

After death, he who is ignorant of the self, although versed in the
Vedas, and has performed the rites prescribed therein, exhausts his

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

merit after a brief enjoyment and undergoes very great misery in having
to be born again. He who has realised the self and yet longs for reward,
enjoys much greater and more lasting happiness accompanied by
supernatural powers. Therefore, one should indeed realise the self; for,
by realising it, one gains every happiness although he longs for no
reward. (86).

It is no wonder that objects are not revealed by the sun, moon, etc., of
their own accord nor is the sun directly perceived by its own light, nor
the moon, nor fire. On the other hand, the sun, moon, etc., are
perceived by means of the sense of sight inspired by (the inner)
consciousness. Therefore, only the dweller in the body shines by his own
light.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Yet, in the
World, <span id="fr_146"></span>[\*](#fn_140.md) the, deities <span
id="fr_147"></span>[†](#fn_141.md) have their respective power to
illuminate. (87).

Through the life-force called *prâna* the individual drinks plenty of
water and eats food Then the abdominal fire, with energy derived from,
that (*prâṇa*), digests it sooner or later. Thereafter the life-force
known as *vyâna* carries the essence along the blood-vessels of the
whole body for the nourishment of life; and the life-force termed
*apâna* expels from the body the putrid non-essence. (88).

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

This life, with its five-fold energy <span
id="fr_148"></span>[\*](#fn_142.md), residing in each body and being master
of all the senses, distinctly and incessantly carries on all the
activities appropriate to that particular body, by a power which belongs
undoubtedly to the self that is pure consciousness. That self am I, the
all-seer, the life behind all life, the consciousness behind the
consciousness of all beings. (89).

By the light of that One Self that is pure consciousness, the earth,
water, air, sun, moon, etc., shine after It, each with its peculiar

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

characteristics, and have their being in It. Can the flashes of
lightning and flaming conflagrations and the vast expanse of starry
galaxies illumine the Supreme Lord, the immutable, infinite light, the
seer, without beginning and without end, eternal, because devoid of
origin? (90).

If, by the favour of the nectar-like glance, full of unparalleled mercy,
of the venerable holy Master, there arises, in any man whatsoever, the
realisation "That very Brahman am I," he indeed loses all feelings of
doubt and, with his mind free from illusion, attains liberation even
while living in the body. (Thereafter), when the beginningless
limitation <span id="fr_149"></span>[\*](#fn_143.md) is completely
dissolved, he is merged in the Highest, the sole abode of eternal bliss.
(91)

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

I am neither the dense body nor the senses, nor the evanescent and most
erratic mind, nor reason, nor life, nor the ego, nor wife, nor house,
nor offspring, nor kith and kin, nor land nor wealth, and so on. For,
how can I, the witness aloof, the pure consciousness, the inner self, be
all these things which are purely objective? I am the Supreme <span
id="fr_150"></span>[\*](#fn_144.md) that is the reality behind all this
Universe. (92).

In relation to all these plainly visible forms of dark, yellow and other
innumerable colours,

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

the eye, which is one, is the seer, for, therein arises the perception.
The eye, in its turn, is only objective, because the mind is its seer.
And even the workings of the mind, objective forms transformed into
thought, are, in their turn, objective. The Lord alone is the absolute
seer, the witness, for, He is never, like the above, objective. (93).

Owing to the non-recognition of a rope in the twilight, over it appears
a serpent all at once. In the sane way is the extremely unhappy
condition of the individual soul imposed on the self by reason of the
non-realisation of one's own self. Again, when the illusion of a serpent
is dispelled by the admonition of a trustworthy friend, there is only
the old familiar rope. So, too, by the admonition of my own Master, I am
not

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

the individual soul, but the immutable Self that is the seer. I am the
Supreme Bliss (*Ṣiva*.) (94).

Tell me what is thy light. You say: "The sun in the day and the moon,
lamp, etc., at night." It may be so, but by what light do you see the
sun, the lamp, etc? You say: "the eye." But when that is closed, what
brighter light is there? You reply: "the mind." By what light is the
mind revealed? "For that, I alone am the light," you say. You are
therefore that Supreme Light. "I am, my Master." (95).

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

Such a one <span id="fr_151"></span>[\*](#fn_145.md) after remaining on the
earth for a time, never more returns to a body and its accompaniments;
until the enjoyment of the ripe fruits of his former actions is
completed, he lives in a peculiar manner, but blissfully, because his
mind is free from all contrasts <span id="fr_152"></span>[†](#fn_146.md),
ever pure, devoid of my-ness and I-ness, always contented, identical in
nature with infinite bliss, steady in thought, imperturbable, cleansed
of all illusions. <span id="fr_153"></span>[‡](#fn_147) (96.md).

Such an absolutely resplendent realisation at once destroys the
distinction between the individual soul and Supreme Self. In whomsoever
such an unimpeded, unparalleled realisation springs up in consciousness,
for him

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

the root-illusion (*mâyâ*) that is the source of births and deaths, is
destroyed by that very realisation. Once destroyed, it can no more
create illusions by its power of phenomenal manifestation. (97).

Knowing that the universe is unreal and bluing, therefore, completely
destroyed all perception of phenomenal forms, he should taste, to his
heart's utmost content, the morsel of immortal bliss that is the highest
and most perfect concentration of being and consciousness, and, filled
with the light of the self and with a tranquil mind, he should realise
that all this universe is unessential and should therefore abandon it,
in the same way as one, after drinking the juice of a fruit, throws it
away although the remnant may be highly fragrant. (98).

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

The results of actions are destroyed, the bondage of the heart is
broken, and all doubts, which lead one to births, and deaths, are
removed, as soon as one realises that Supreme Lord, whose nature is pure
consciousness, who is devoid of the stain of qualities, who is
realisable by such teachings as "That thou art," the immutable inner
self, the Brahman, the Lord, that is beyond all commandments and beyond
all thought. (99).

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

One should understand the huge tree of phenomenal existence, which bears
the fruits of births and deaths before, betwixt and after, whose roots
are the results of past actions, whose countless leaves are delusions,
vanities, joys and sorrows, whose branches are desire, anger, etc., and
on which dwell the birds of sons and cattle, wives and daughters, in
large numbers. Such a wise man should fell this tree down with the axe
of non-attachment and should at all times meditate upon the Supreme
Being (*vâsudeva*). (100).

The whole universe is born in me, has its support in me and dissolves in
me. Therefore, that very Brahman indeed am I. Again, humbly and
exultingly do I bow to that Immutable Being (*achyuta*), by whose mere

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

remembrance any defective procedure in all auspicious acts like
sacrifices is rendered perfectly complete. (101).
