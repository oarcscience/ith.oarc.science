### Commentary on the Text.

I salute the Lord of Lakshmî, the cause of creation, preservation and
dissolution, the Lord of the universe possessing inconceivable power,
omniscient, infinite in form, free of all bondage, the ocean of
unbounded bliss, the concentration of pure knowledge. (1).

I ever prostrate to the lotus-feet of Him by whose grace I always
realise the nature of the

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

self to the effect that I alone am the Supreme and that all things are
merely superimposed on me. (2).

Sorely afflicted by the sun of the three miseries <span
id="fr_166"></span>[\*](#fn_160.md), and perplexed in mind, some one, after
acquiring the qualifications of mind-control, etc., asks the good Master
as follows. (3).

O Lord, out of mere mercy, tell me briefly bow I may, without (much)
effort, be liberated from this bondage of births and deaths. (4).

(The Master replies.) The manner of thy speech seems to me to be
excellent. I shall explain to thee clearly which is which. Listen with
an attentive mind. (5).

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

The knowledge relating to the identity of the individual soul and the
Supreme Self that arises from texts like "That thou art," is the means
to liberation. (6).

What is the individual soul? What is the Supreme Self? How can there be
identity between the two? And how can texts like "That thou art" express
the same? (7).

We shall explain it (thus). What else, indeed, is the individual soul
except thou alone. Thou that questionest me, 'who am I', art Brahman
itself, without doubt. (8).

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

I have not yet clearly grasped, O Lord, even the meaning of the words,
"I am Brahman." How can I understand, tell me, the meaning of the
sentence (as a whole)? (9).

What thou sayest is true and free from reproach. For, a knowledge of the
word-meaning is indeed essential for the understanding of the
sentence-meaning. (10).

Why dost thou not understand thyself,—thou whose very nature is reality
and bliss and (pure) consciousness that is the witness of the individual
consciousness and all its workings? (11).

Leaving aside all thought relating to the body, etc., thou shouldst ever
meditate upon

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

that whose nature is reality, bliss, and knowledge and which is the
witness of consciousness, as thyself. (12).

Because the body has form, etc., like an earthen vessel or other object,
and is, like an earthen vessel, composed of the (five) great elements,
ether, etc., it cannot be the self. (13).

If, for the reasons aforesaid, this body is not the self; reveal the
self, then, as clearly as a berry in the hand. (14).

As the witness of an earthen pot is different, from the pot and is not
the pot in any sense, so is the witness of the body. Understand,
therefore, "I am not the body." (15).

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

Conclude, in the same way, "I am the witness of the senses and not the
senses themselves." So, too, understand, "I am not the mind, the
consciousness, or the life-force." (16).

Also "I am not the combination (of these)." Understand, thus, by
intelligent reasoning, the witness that is distinct from the object.
(17).

Understand “I am He by whose mere proximity, the body, senses and other
object become of (all) activities like selection, etc. (18).

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

Understand “I am that inner self which impels, the consciousness, etc.,
but is itself unchanging, like the lodestone. (19).

Understand “I am He by whose proximity, the body, senses, mind, and
life-forces, though motionless, vet seem like the self that is not so.
(20).

'My mind had gone elsewhere, but has now been steadied.' Understand "I
am He who knows the above activity of the mind." (21).

Understand “I am He who is the direct witness, himself changeless, of
waking, dream and sleep, and of the presence and absence of objects, and
of all phases of consciousness. (22).

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

As it is admitted that the light revealing (the presence of) a pot is
other than the pot, so am I of the nature of knowledge, the dweller in
the body that reveals the body. (23).

Understand "I am the witness that is the dearest of all, for whose sake
alone, sons, wealth and other objects are dear." (24).

Understand "I am the witness who, being himself the object of highest
love, feels 'let me never cease to be, but let me ever exist.'" (25).

The consciousness that is the witness is said to be the meaning of the
word "thou." The

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

self is the witness and the knower, because it is devoid of change.
(26).

By the word "thou" is denoted that which is different from the body,
senses, mind, life-forces, and ego, and is entirely devoid of the six
states <span id="fr_167"></span>[\*](#fn_161) or other change. (27.md).

Having thus understood the meaning of "thou," one should then
contemplate the meaning of "that," both by eliminating what is not
'that' and by means of direct definitions thereof. (28).

Bereft of all taint of phenomenal existence, characterised by phrases
like "not dense, etc.",

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

qualified by non-objectivity, etc., free from the stain of nescience,
(29),

Bliss unsurpassed, reality, knowledge, and existence by nature,
all-filling,—'that' is spoken of as the Supreme Self. (30).

Understand that to be the Brahman in respect of which the Vedas assert
omniscience, supreme lordship and omnipotence. (31).

Understand that to be the Brahman of which the Vedas explain, by various
illustrations like clay <span id="fr_168"></span>[\*](#fn_162.md), etc.,
that, by knowing it, all things are known: (32).

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

Understand that to be the Brahman, of which the Vedas enunciate
infinitude and, to establish it, declare the universe to be the effect
of that. <span id="fr_169"></span>[\*](#fn_163) (33.md).

Understand that to he the Brahman which, in the Vedânta, is established,
by close reasoning, as the (only) thing to be realised by the aspirants
for liberation. (34).

Understand that to he the Brahman which is spoken of in the Vedas as
having entered all beings as their souls and controlling them. (35).

Understand that to be the Brahman which alone is spoken of in the Vedas
as the bestower of the reward of actions and the originator of the
cause <span id="fr_170"></span>[†](#fn_164.md) of individual existence.
(36).

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

The meanings of the words 'that' and 'thou' have been determined. The
meaning of the sentence will now be dealt with. This sentence-meaning is
the identity between those same two word-meanings. (37)

The accepted meaning of the sentence, in this case, is neither
co-existence nor particularisation. The meaning of the sentence, as
accepted by the wise, is essential identity without reservation. (38).

What appears as the inner consciousness is that whose characteristic is
secondless bliss, whose nature is secondless bliss, and whose sole
definition is inner consciousness. (39).

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

When the mutual identity of the two is thus understood, then only will
the non-Brahmanness of the word-meaning 'thou' be eliminated. (40).

as also the unknownness of the word-meaning of 'that.' If it be so, what
then? Listen. The inner consciousness remains absolutely as infinite
bliss by nature. (41).

Further, a sentence like 'that thou art,' in order to denote
[identity](errata.htm#6.md), proceeds on the basis of the secondary <span
id="fr_171"></span>[\*](#fn_165.md) meaning of the two words 'that' and
'thou.' (42).

We shall carefully explain how the sentence makes its own meaning clear,
by excluding the expressed meanings of the two words, which are mixed
up. (43).

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

The consciousness, conditioned by the mind, which appears as the
connecting link between the idea "I" and the word "I", is expressed by
the word "thou". (44).

The first cause of the worlds, conditioned by nescience (*mâyâ*),
characterised by omniscience, etc. <span
id="fr_172"></span>[\*](#fn_166.md), of the nature of reality, etc. <span
id="fr_173"></span>[†](#fn_167.md), and affected by non-cognisability, is
expressed by the word "that". (45).

(But) cognisability and non-cognisability, having a second and being
.infinite, are inconsistent in respect of the same thing. Hence is the
necessity for the derived (or secondary) meaning. (46).

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

When the adoption of the primary meaning is inconsistent with other
(established) proofs, the adoption of a meaning not unconnected with the
principal meaning, is called the derivation of meaning (*lakshanâ*).
(47).

The derivation of meaning, in the case of passages like "that thou art",
is a partial derivation, and no other as in the case of the words in
sentences like "This is he". (48).

Until the sentence-meaning of "I am Brahman" is firmly understood, so
long should one possess control of mind, etc., and practise (the
expedients of hearing, <span id="fr_174"></span>[\*](#fn_168) etc..md).
(49).

When, by the grace of the Vedic teacher, one gets a firm understanding
(of the above sentence), then is he entirely free from phenomenal
condition and its cause. <span id="fr_175"></span>[†](#fn_169) (50.md).

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

All ends and means destroyed, unconditioned by the elements and the
subtler bodies, and free from the bonds of action, such a one is
immediately liberated. (51).

When, by the destruction of the bondage of past actions not yet ripe for
enjoyment, one becomes liberated while living, he remains as such for a
short time by virtue of such of his past actions as have brought about
his present life. (52).

(Thereafter) he attains absolute liberation without any more birth,
which is of the nature of unsurpassed bliss and is known as the supreme
abode of Vishnu. (53).
