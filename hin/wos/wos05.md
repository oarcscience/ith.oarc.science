### Hymn to Dakshinamurti.

Who, by virtue of the illusion residing in the self, sees, as in a
dream, the universe as existing outside Himself although (more truly) it
exists within Himself like the reflection of a city in a mirror, but
Who, at the time of the awakening, sees naught but His own secondless
self,—to that Teacher incarnate, the Lord facing the south, be this bow.
(1)

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

Who, like a magician or like a *yogi*, manifests, by His own will, this
universe which at the beginning was undifferentiated like the sprout
latent in the seed but which subsequently became differentiated under
the various conditions of space and time induced by illusion,—to that
Teacher incarnate, <span id="fr_31"></span>[\*](#fn_28.md) the Lord facing
the south, be this bow. (2)

Whose light alone that is the reality shines in things that resemble
non-entities <span id="fr_32"></span>[\*](#fn_28.md); Who directly awakens
His devotees by means of the Vedic sentence "That thou art"; and Who
being realised, there is no more coming hack in this ocean of
*Samsâra*,—to that Teacher incarnate, the Lord facing the south, be this
bow. (3)

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

Whose consciousness flows out through the eye and other senses like the
light of a big lamp placed inside a jar with many holes, and (thus) this
whole universe shines solely because He shines, namely, by the
consciousness "I know,"—to that Teacher incarnate, the Lord facing the
south, be this bow. (4)

Deluded persons who talk much, but who are as ignorant as women and
children, the blind and the stupid, understand, as the "I," the body, or
the breath, or the senses, or the ever-newly-springing knowledge <span
id="fr_33"></span>[\*](#fn_29.md), or non-entity.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> To Him who dispels
this great ignorance induced by the expansive power of illusion <span
id="fr_34"></span>[\*](#fn_30.md),—to that Teacher incarnate, the Lord
facing the south, be this bow. (5)

Who is the inner self which, under the veil of illusion, like the sun or
the moon eclipsed, merely exists <span id="fr_35"></span>[†](#fn_31.md) in
deep sleep owing to the withdrawal of the senses, but which when He
wakes, is recognised by Him as "I have slept",—to that Teacher
incarnate, the Lord facing the south, be this bow. (6)

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

Who reveals to His devotees, by means of the blessed symbol, <span
id="fr_36"></span>[\*](#fn_32.md) His own self which, for ever, shines
within as the "I" unchanging through all the changing states of
childhood, youth and old age, waking, dream and sleep, etc.,—to that
Teacher incarnate, the Lord facing the south, be this bow. (7)

Who is the supreme self that, dreaming or waking, under the sway of
illusion, sees the universe under various distinctions such as that of
cause and effect, owner and owned, pupil and teacher, father and son,—to
that Teacher incarnate, the Lord facing the south, be this bow. (8)

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

Whose eightfold form alone, namely, earth, water, fire, air; ether, sun,
moon and soul, manifests itself as this sentient and non-sentient
universe; than Whom, supreme and infinite, naught else is perceived by
the seekers of reality,—to that Teacher incarnate, the Lord facing the
south, be this bow. (9)

Since, in this hymn, the identity of the self with the universe has been
made clear, by listening to it, by understanding its meaning, by
meditating on it, and by teaching it to others, one will acquire the
supreme faculty of [identity](errata.htm#0.md) with the universe, together
with

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

the overlordship of nature and the eightfold divine faculty. <span
id="fr_37"></span>[\*](#fn_33) (10.md)

 

 

Thus ends the hymn to Dakshinamurti.
