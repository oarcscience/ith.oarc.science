### The Ten-versed Hymn.

I am neither earth, nor water, nor fire, nor air, nor ether, nor sensory
organ, nor the conglomeration of all these; for, all these are
transient. I am He that alone remains in deep sleep, the secondless,
uncontradictable <span id="fr_30"></span>[\*](#fn_27.md) attributeless
Bliss (Ṣiva). (1)

I am neither castes, nor the rules of caste, society and custom, nor for
me are concentration,

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

meditation, *Yoga* and other practices; for, all this illusion of "I"
and "mine" is-rooted in the not-self and is therefore dispellable by the
knowledge of the self. I am therefore the secondless, uncontradictable,
attributeless Bliss (Ṣiva). (2)

I am neither mother, nor father, nor the gods, nor the worlds, nor the
*Vedas*, nor sacrifices, nor any holy place; for, in deep sleep I am
\[identical with Brahman which however is\] not absolute non-existence.
I am therefore the secondless, uncontradictable attributeless Bliss
(Ṣiva). (3)

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

Neither the Sânkhya doctrine, nor the Ṣaiva, nor the Pâncharâtra, not
the Jaina, nor the Mîmâmsaka, nor any other, holds good. For, by special
realisation it is revealed that my nature is absolutely pure. I am
therefore the secondless, uncontradictable. attributeless Bliss (Ṣiva).
(4)

I am neither above, nor below, nor inside, nor outside, nor middle, nor
across, nor before, nor behind; for I am indivisible and one by nature
and am all-pervading like space. I am therefore the secondless,
uncontradictable, attributeless Bliss (Ṣiva). (5)

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

I am neither white, nor black, nor red, nor yellow, nor bent, nor stout,
nor short, nor tall, nor even formless; for, I am of the nature of
self-resplendent consciousness. I am therefore the secondless,
uncontradictable, attributeless Bliss (Ṣiva). (6)

There is neither teacher, nor science, nor pupil, nor teaching, nor you
(the hearer), nor I (the speaker), nor this empirical universe; for, I
am the consciousness of the reality, which does not admit of
differentiation. I am therefore the secondless, uncontradictable,
attributeless Bliss (Ṣiva). (7)

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

For me there is neither waking nor dream nor deep sleep, nor am I the
self conditioned by any of these three states (*viṣva*, *taijasa* or
*prâjṇa*); for, all these are of the nature of nescience, but I am the
fourth beyond these three. I am therefore the secondless,
uncontradictable, attributeless Bliss (Ṣiva). (8)

All this universe, being other than the <span
class="smallcaps">Self</span>, is unreal; for, the <span
class="smallcaps">Self</span> alone is all-inclusive, constitutes the
ultimate goal and is self-established and self-dependent. I am therefore
the secondless, uncontradictable, attributeless Bliss (Ṣiva). (9)

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

It cannot even be said that It is One. How then can there be a second,
other than That? There is neither absoluteness nor non-absoluteness,
neither non-entity nor entity; for It is absolutely non-dual in Its
nature. How then can I describe That which is established by all the
Vedântas!

<span class="small">Thus ends the ten-versed hymn.</span>
