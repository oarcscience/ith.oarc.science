This page indexes writings of the philosopher Baruch Spinoza at
Intangible Textual Heritage. Spinoza (b. 1632, d. 1677) was one of the
first of the Enlightenment philosophers. He was born to Sephardic
Portuguese Jewish parents, living in the Netherlands due to the
Inquisition. His views were so novel, particularly his biblical
criticism, that some of his works were only published posthumously,
particularly the Ethics. He was essentially excommunicated from the
Jewish community, and took on the name Benedictus, the Latin translation
of Baruch, 'Blessed.' He worked all his life as a lens grinder.
