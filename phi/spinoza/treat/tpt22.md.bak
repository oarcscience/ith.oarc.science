*A Theologico-Political Treatise*, by Benedict de Spinoza, \[1883\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

#### AUTHOR'S ENDNOTES TO THE THEOLOGICO-POLITICAL TREATISE

CHAPTER XI.

Endnote 24. (1) "Now I think." (2) The translators render the \[Greek\]
word "I infer", and assert that Paul uses it as synonymous with \[a
Greek word\]. (3) But the former word has, in Greek, the same meaning as
the Hebrew word rendered to think, to esteem, to judge. (4) And this
signification would be in entire agreement with the Syriac translation.
(5) This Syriac translation (if it be a translation, which is very
doubtful, for we know neither the time of its appearance, nor the
translators and Syriac was the vernacular of the Apostles) renders the
text before us in a way well explained by Tremellius as "we think,
therefore."

CHAPTER XV.

Endnote 25. (1) "That simple obedience is the path of salvation." (2) In
other words, it is enough for salvation or blessedness, that we should
embrace the Divine decrees as laws or commands; there is no need to
conceive them as eternal truths. (3) This can be taught us by
Revelation, not Reason, as appears from the demonstrations given in
Chapter IV.
