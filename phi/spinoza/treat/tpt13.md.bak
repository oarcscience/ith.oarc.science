### CHAPTER IX—OTHER QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE SAME BOOKS: NAMELY, WHETHER THEY WERE COMPLETELY FINISHED BY EZRA, AND, FURTHER, WHETHER THE MARGINAL NOTES WHICH ARE FOUND IN THE HEBREW TEXTS WERE VARIOUS READINGS.

\(1\) How greatly the inquiry we have just made concerning the real
writer of the twelve books aids us in attaining a complete understanding
of them, may be easily gathered solely from the passages which we have
adduced in confirmation of our opinion, and which would be most obscure
without it. (2) But besides the question of the writer, there are other
points to notice which common superstition forbids the multitude to
apprehend. (3) Of these the chief is, that Ezra (whom I will take to be
the author of the aforesaid books until some more likely person be
suggested) did not put the finishing touches to the narrative contained
therein, but merely collected the histories from various writers, and
sometimes simply set them down, leaving their examination and
arrangement to posterity.

\(4\) The cause (if it were not untimely death) which prevented him from
completing his work in all its portions, I cannot conjecture, but the
fact remains most clear, although we have lost the writings of the
ancient Hebrew historians, and can only judge from the few fragments
which are still extant. (5) For the history of Hezekiah (2 Kings
xviii:17), as written in the vision of Isaiah, is related as it is found
in the chronicles of the kings of Judah. (6) We read the same story,
told with few exceptions, \[Endnote 11\], in the same words, in the book
of Isaiah which was contained in the chronicles of the kings of Judah (2
Chron. xxxii:32). (7) From this we must conclude that there were various
versions of this narrative of Isaiah's, unless, indeed, anyone would
dream that in this, too, there lurks a mystery. (8) Further, the last
chapter of 2 Kings 27-30 is repeated in the last chapter of Jeremiah,
v.31-34.

\(9\) Again, we find 2 Sam. vii. repeated in I Chron. xvii., but the
expressions in the two passages are so curiously varied \[Endnote 12\],
that we can very easily see that these two chapters were taken from two
different versions of the history of Nathan.

\(10\) Lastly, the genealogy of the kings of Idumaea contained in
Genesis xxxvi:31, is repeated in the same words in 1 Chron. i., though
we know that the author of the latter work took his materials from other
historians, not from the twelve books we have ascribed to Ezra. (10) We
may therefore be sure that if we still possessed the writings of the
historians, the matter would be made clear; however, as we have lost
them, we can only examine the writings still extant, and from their
order and connection, their various repetitions, and, lastly, the
contradictions in dates which they contain, judge of the rest.

\(11\) These, then, or the chief of them, we will now go through. (12)
First, in the story of Judah and Tamar (Gen. xxxviii.) the historian
thus begins: "And it came to pass at that time that Judah went down from
his brethren." (13) This time cannot refer to what immediately precedes
\[Endnote 13\], but must necessarily refer to something else, for from
the time when Joseph was sold into Egypt to the time when the patriarch
Jacob, with all his family, set out thither, cannot be reckoned as more
than twenty-two years, for Joseph, when he was sold by his brethren, was
seventeen years old, and when he was summoned by Pharaoh from prison was
thirty; if to this we add the seven years of plenty and two of famine,
the total amounts to twenty-two years. (14) Now, in so short a period,
no one can suppose that so many things happened as are described; that
Judah had three children, one after the other, from one wife, whom he
married at the beginning of the period; that the eldest of these, when
he was old enough, married Tamar, and that after he died his next
brother succeeded to her; that, after all this, Judah, without knowing
it, had intercourse with his daughter-in-law, and that she bore him
twins, and, finally, that the eldest of these twins became a father
within the aforesaid period. (15) As all these events cannot have taken
place within the period mentioned in Genesis, the reference must
necessarily be to something treated of in another book: and Ezra in this
instance simply related the story, and inserted it without examination
among his other writings.

\(16\) However, not only this chapter but the whole narrative of Joseph
and Jacob is collected and set forth from various histories, inasmuch as
it is quite inconsistent with itself. (17) For in Gen. xlvii. we are
told that Jacob, when he came at Joseph's bidding to salute Pharaoh, was
130 years old. (18) If from this we deduct the twenty-two years which he
passed sorrowing for the absence of Joseph and the seventeen years
forming Joseph's age when he was sold, and, lastly, the seven years for
which Jacob served for Rachel, we find that he was very advanced in
life, namely, eighty four, when he took Leah to wife, whereas Dinah was
scarcely seven years old when she was violated by Shechem, \[Endnote
14\]. (19) Simeon and Levi were aged respectively eleven and twelve when
they spoiled the city and slew all the males therein with the sword.

\(20\) There is no need that I should go through the whole Pentateuch.
(21) If anyone pays attention to the way in which all the histories and
precepts in these five books are set down promiscuously and without
order, with no regard for dates; and further, how the same story is
often repeated, sometimes in a different version, he will easily, I say,
discern that all the materials were promiscuously collected and heaped
together, in order that they might at some subsequent time be more
readily examined and reduced to order. (22) Not only these five books,
but also the narratives contained in the remaining seven, going down to
the destruction of the city, are compiled in the same way. (23) For who
does not see that in Judges ii:6 a new historian is being quoted, who
had also written of the deeds of Joshua, and that his words are simply
copied? (24) For after our historian has stated in the last chapter of
the book of Joshua that Joshua died and was buried, and has promised, in
the first chapter of Judges, to relate what happened after his death, in
what way, if he wished to continue the thread of his history, could he
connect the statement here made about Joshua with what had gone before?

\(25\) So, too, 1 Sam. 17, 18, are taken from another historian, who
assigns a cause for David's first frequenting Saul's court very
different from that given in chap. xvi. of the same book. (26) For he
did not think that David came to Saul in consequence of the advice of
Saul's servants, as is narrated in chap. xvi., but that being sent by
chance to the camp by his father on a message to his brothers, he was
for the first time remarked by Saul on the occasion of his victory, over
Goliath the Philistine, and was retained at his court.

\(27\) I suspect the same thing has taken place in chap. xxvi. of the
same book, for the historian there seems to repeat the narrative given
in chap. xxiv. according to another man's version. (28) But I pass over
this, and go on to the computation of dates.

\(29\) In I Kings, chap. vi., it is said that Solomon built the Temple
in the four hundred and eightieth year after the exodus from Egypt; but
from the historians themselves we get a much longer period, for:

\(30\) All these periods added together make a total of 580 years. (31)
But to these must be added the years during which the Hebrew republic
flourished after the death of Joshua, until it was conquered by Cushan
Rishathaim, which I take to be very numerous, for I cannot bring myself
to believe that immediately after the death of Joshua all those who had
witnessed his miracles died simultaneously, nor that their successors at
one stroke bid farewell to their laws, and plunged from the highest
virtue into the depth of wickedness and obstinacy.

\(32\) Nor, lastly, that Cushan Rishathaim subdued them on the instant;
each one of these circumstances requires almost a generation, and there
is no doubt that Judges ii:7, 9, 10, comprehends a great many years
which it passes over in silence. (33) We must also add the years during
which Samuel was judge, the number of which is not stated in Scripture,
and also the years during which Saul reigned, which are not clearly
shown from his history. (34) It is, indeed, stated in 1 Sam. xiii:1,
that he reigned two years, but the text in that passage is mutilated,
and the records of his reign lead us to suppose a longer period. (35)
That the text is mutilated I suppose no one will doubt who has ever
advanced so far as the threshold of the Hebrew language, for it runs as
follows: "Saul was in his -- year, when he began to reign, and he
reigned two years over Israel." (36) Who, I say, does not see that the
number of the years of Saul's age when he began to reign has been
omitted? (37) That the record of the reign presupposes a greater number
of years is equally beyond doubt, for in the same book, chap. xxvii:7,
it is stated that David sojourned among the Philistines, to whom he had
fled on account of Saul, a year and four months; thus the rest of the
reign must have been comprised in a space of eight months, which I think
no one will credit. (38) Josephus, at the end of the sixth book of his
antiquities, thus corrects the text: Saul reigned eighteen years while
Samuel was alive, and two years after his death. (39) However, all the
narrative in chap. Xiii. is in complete disagreement with what goes
before. (40) At the end of chap. vii. it is narrated that the
Philistines were so crushed by the Hebrews that they did not venture,
during Samuel's life, to invade the borders of Israel; but in chap.
xiii. we are told that the Hebrews were invaded during the life of
Samuel by the Philistines, and reduced by them to such a state of
wretchedness and poverty that they were deprived not only of weapons
with which to defend themselves, but also of the means of making more.
(41) I should be at pains enough if I were to try and harmonize all the
narratives contained in this first book of Samuel so that they should
seem to be all written and arranged by a single historian. (42) But I
return to my object. (43) The years, then, during which Saul reigned
must be added to the above computation; and, lastly, I have not counted
the years of the Hebrew anarchy, for I cannot from Scripture gather
their number. (44) I cannot, I say, be certain as to the period occupied
by the events related in Judges chap. xvii. on till the end of the book.

\(45\) It is thus abundantly evident that we cannot arrive at a true
computation of years from the histories, and, further, that the
histories are inconsistent themselves on the subject. (46) We are
compelled to confess that these histories were compiled from various
writers without previous arrangement and examination. (47) Not less
discrepancy is found between the dates given in the Chronicles of the
Kings of Judah, and those in the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel; in
the latter, it is stated that Jehoram, the son of Ahab, began to reign
in the second year of the reign of Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat (2
Kings i:17), but in the former we read that Jehoram, the son of
Jehoshaphat, began to reign in the fifth year of Jehoram, the son of
Ahab (2 Kings viii:16). (48) Anyone who compares the narratives in
Chronicles with the narratives in the books of Kings, will find many
similar discrepancies. (49) These there is no need for me to examine
here, and still less am I called upon to treat of the commentaries of
those who endeavour to harmonize them. (50) The Rabbis evidently let
their fancy run wild. (51) Such commentators as I have, read, dream,
invent, and as a last resort, play fast and loose with the language.
(52) For instance, when it is said in 2 Chronicles, that Ahab was
forty-two years old when he began to reign, they pretend that these
years are computed from the reign of Omri, not from the birth of Ahab.
(53) If this can be shown to be the real meaning of the writer of the
book of Chronicles, all I can say is, that he did not know how to state
a fact. (54) The commentators make many other assertions of this kind,
which if true, would prove that the ancient Hebrews were ignorant both
of their own language, and of the way to relate a plain narrative. (55)
I should in such case recognize no rule or reason in interpreting
Scripture, but it would be permissible to hypothesize to one's heart's
content.

\(56\) If anyone thinks that I am speaking too generally, and without
sufficient warrant, I would ask him to set himself to showing us some
fixed plan in these histories which might be followed without blame by
other writers of chronicles, and in his efforts at harmonizing and
interpretation, so strictly to observe and explain the phrases and
expressions, the order and the connections, that we may be able to
imitate these also in our writings (17). (57) If he succeeds, I will at
once give him my hand, and he shall be to me as great Apollo; for I
confess that after long endeavours I have been unable to discover
anything of the kind. (58) I may add that I set down nothing here which
I have not long reflected upon, and that, though I was imbued from my
boyhood up with the ordinary opinions about the Scriptures, I have been
unable to withstand the force of what I have urged.

\(59\) However, there is no need to detain the reader with this
question, and drive him to attempt an impossible task; I merely
mentioned the fact in order to throw light on my intention.

\(60\) I now pass on to other points concerning the treatment of these
books. (61) For we must remark, in addition to what has been shown, that
these books were not guarded by posterity with such care that no faults
crept in. (62) The ancient scribes draw attention to many doubtful
readings, and some mutilated passages, but not to all that exist:
whether the faults are of sufficient importance to greatly embarrass the
reader I will not now discuss. (63) I am inclined to think that they are
of minor moment to those, at any rate, who read the Scriptures with
enlightenment: and I can positively, affirm that I have not noticed any
fault or various reading in doctrinal passages sufficient to render them
obscure or doubtful.

\(64\) There are some people, however, who will not admit that there is
any corruption, even in other passages, but maintain that by some unique
exercise of providence God has preserved from corruption every word in
the Bible: they say that the various readings are the symbols of
profoundest mysteries, and that mighty secrets lie hid in the
twenty-eight hiatus which occur, nay, even in the very form of the
letters.

\(65\) Whether they are actuated by folly and anile devotion, or whether
by arrogance and malice so that they alone may be held to possess the
secrets of God, I know not: this much I do know, that I find in their
writings nothing which has the air of a Divine secret, but only childish
lucubrations. (66) I have read and known certain Kabbalistic triflers,
whose insanity provokes my unceasing as astonishment. (67) That faults
have crept in will, I think, be denied by no sensible person who reads
the passage about Saul, above quoted (1 Sam. xiii:1) and also 2 Sam.
vi:2: "And David arose and went with all the people that were with him
from Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God."

\(68\) No one can fail to remark that the name of their destination,
viz., Kirjath-jearim \[Endnote 18\], has been omitted: nor can we deny
that 2 Sam. xiii:37, has been tampered with and mutilated. "And Absalom
fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. (69) And
he mourned for his son every day. So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur,
and was there three years." (70) I know that I have remarked other
passages of the same kind, but I cannot recall them at the moment.

\(71\) That the marginal notes which are found continually in the Hebrew
Codices are doubtful readings will, I think, be evident to everyone who
has noticed that they often arise from the great similarity, of some of
the Hebrew letters, such for instance, as the similarity between Kaph
and Beth, Jod and Van, Daleth and Reth, &c. (72) For example, the text
in 2 Sam. v:24, runs "in the time when thou hearest," and similarly in
Judges xxi:22, "And it shall be when their fathers or their brothers
come unto us often," the marginal version is "come unto us to complain."

\(73\) So also many various readings have arisen from the use of the
letters named mutes, which are generally not sounded in pronunciation,
and are taken promiscuously, one for the other. (74) For example, in
Levit. xxv:29, it is written, "The house shall be established which is
not in the walled city," but the margin has it, "which is in a walled
city."

\(75\) Though these matters are self-evident, \[Endnote 6\], it is
necessary, to answer the reasonings of certain Pharisees, by which they
endeavour to convince us that the marginal notes serve to indicate some
mystery, and were added or pointed out by the writers of the sacred
books. (76) The first of these reasons, which, in my, opinion, carries
little weight, is taken from the practice of reading the Scriptures
aloud.

\(77\) If, it is urged, these notes were added to show various readings
which could not be decided upon by posterity, why has custom prevailed
that the marginal readings should always be retained? (78) Why has the
meaning which is preferred been set down in the margin when it ought to
have been incorporated in the text, and not relegated to a side note?

\(79\) The second reason is more specious, and is taken from the nature
of the case. (80) It is admitted that faults have crept into the sacred
writings by chance and not by design; but they say that in the five
books the word for a girl is, with one exception, written without the
letter "he," contrary to all grammatical rules, whereas in the margin it
is written correctly according to the universal rule of grammar. (81)
Can this have happened by mistake? Is it possible to imagine a clerical
error to have been committed every, time the word occurs? (82) Moreover,
it would have been easy, to supply the emendation. (83) Hence, when
these readings are not accidental or corrections of manifest mistakes,
it is supposed that they must have been set down on purpose by the
original writers, and have a meaning. (84) However, it is easy to answer
such arguments; as to the question of custom having prevailed in the
reading of the marginal versions, I will not spare much time for its
consideration: I know not the promptings of superstition, and perhaps
the practice may have arisen from the idea that both readings were
deemed equally good or tolerable, and therefore, lest either should be
neglected, one was appointed to be written, and the other to be read.
(85) They feared to pronounce judgment in so weighty a matter lest they
should mistake the false for the true, and therefore they would give
preference to neither, as they must necessarily have done if they had
commanded one only to be both read and written. (86) This would be
especially the case where the marginal readings were not written down in
the sacred books: or the custom may have originated because some things
though rightly written down were desired to be read otherwise according
to the marginal version, and therefore the general rule was made that
the marginal version should be followed in reading the Scriptures. (87)
The cause which induced the scribes to expressly prescribe certain
passages to be read in the marginal version, I will now touch on, for
not all the marginal notes are various readings, but some mark
expressions which have passed out of common use, obsolete words and
terms which current decency did not allow to be read in a public
assembly. (88) The ancient writers, without any evil intention, employed
no courtly paraphrase, but called things by their plain names. (891)
Afterwards, through the spread of evil thoughts and luxury, words which
could be used by the ancients without offence, came to be considered
obscene. (90) There was no need for this cause to change the text of
Scripture. (91) Still, as a concession to the popular weakness, it
became the custom to substitute more decent terms for words denoting
sexual intercourse, exereta, &c., and to read them as they were given in
the margin.

\(92\) At any rate, whatever may have been the origin of the practice of
reading Scripture according to the marginal version, it was not that the
true interpretation is contained therein. (93) For besides that, the
Rabbins in the Talmud often differ from the Massoretes, and give other
readings which they approve of, as I will shortly show, certain things
are found in the margin which appear less warranted by the uses of the
Hebrew language. (94) For example, in 2 Samuel xiv:22, we read, "In that
the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant," a construction
plainly regular, and agreeing with that in chap. xvi. (95) But the
margin has it "of thy servant," which does not agree with the person of
the verb. (96) So, too, chap. xvi:25 of the same book, we find, "As if
one had inquired at the oracle of God," the margin adding "someone" to
stand as a nominative to the verb. (97) But the correction is not
apparently warranted, for it is a common practice, well known to
grammarians in the Hebrew language, to use the third person singular of
the active verb impersonally.

\(98\) The second argument advanced by the Pharisees is easily answered
from what has just been said, namely, that the scribes besides the
various readings called attention to obsolete words. (99) For there is
no doubt that in Hebrew as in other languages, changes of use made many
words obsolete and antiquated, and such were found by the later scribes
in the sacred books and noted by them with a view to the books being
publicly read according to custom. (100) For this reason the word nahgar
is always found marked because its gender was originally common, and it
had the same meaning as the Latin juvenis (a young person). (101) So
also the Hebrew capital was anciently called Jerusalem, not Jerusalaim.
(102) As to the pronouns himself and herself, I think that the later
scribes changed vau into jod (a very frequent change in Hebrew) when
they wished to express the feminine gender, but that the ancients only
distinguished the two genders by a change of vowels. (103) I may also
remark that the irregular tenses of certain verbs differ in the ancient
and modern forms, it being formerly considered a mark of elegance to
employ certain letters agreeable to the ear.

\(104\) In a word, I could easily multiply proofs of this kind if I were
not afraid of abusing the patience of the reader. (105) Perhaps I shall
be asked how I became acquainted with the fact that all these
expressions are obsolete. (106) I reply that I have found them in the
most ancient Hebrew writers in the Bible itself, and that they have not
been imitated by subsequent authors, and thus they are recognized as
antiquated, though the language in which they occur is dead. (107) But
perhaps someone may press the question why, if it be true, as I say,
that the marginal notes of the Bible generally mark various readings,
there are never more than two readings of a passage, that in the text
and that in the margin, instead of three or more; and further, how the
scribes can have hesitated between two readings, one of which is
evidently contrary to grammar, and the other a plain correction.

\(108\) The answer to these questions also is easy: I will premise that
it is almost certain that there once were more various readings than
those now recorded. (119) For instance, one finds many in the Talmud
which the Massoretes have neglected, and are so different one from the
other that even the superstitious editor of the Bomberg Bible confesses
that he cannot harmonize them. (110) "We cannot say anything," he
writes, "except what we have said above, namely, that the Talmud is
generally in contradiction to the Massorete." (111) So that we are nor
bound to hold that there never were more than two readings of any
passage, yet I am willing to admit, and indeed I believe that more than
two readings are never found: and for the following reasons:—(112) (I.)
The cause of the differences of reading only admits of two, being
generally the similarity of certain letters, so that the question
resolved itself into which should be written Beth, or Kaf, Jod or Vau,
Daleth or Reth: cases which are constantly occurring, and frequently
yielding a fairly good meaning whichever alternative be adopted. (113)
Sometimes, too, it is a question whether a syllable be long or short,
quantity being determined by the letters called mutes. (114) Moreover,
we never asserted that all the marginal versions, without exception,
marked various readings; on the contrary, we have stated that many were
due to motives of decency or a desire to explain obsolete words. (115)
(II.) I am inclined to attribute the fact that more than two readings
are never found to the paucity of exemplars, perhaps not more than two
or three, found by the scribes. (116) In the treatise of the scribes,
chap. vi., mention is made of three only, pretended to have been found
in the time of Ezra, in order that the marginal versions might be
attributed to him.

\(117\) However that may be, if the scribes only had three codices we
may easily imagine that in a given passage two of them would be in
accord, for it would be extraordinary if each one of the three gave a
different reading of the same text.

\(118\) The dearth of copies after the time of Ezra will surprise no one
who has read the 1st chapter of Maccabees, or Josephus's "Antiquities,"
Bk. 12, chap. 5. (119) Nay, it appears wonderful considering the fierce
and daily persecution, that even these few should have been preserved.
(120) This will, I think, be plain to even a cursory reader of the
history of those times.

\(121\) We have thus discovered the reasons why there are never more
than two readings of a passage in the Bible, but this is a long way from
supposing that we may therefore conclude that the Bible was purposely
written incorrectly in such passages in order to signify some mystery.
(122) As to the second argument, that some passages are so faultily
written that they are at plain variance with all grammar, and should
have been corrected in the text and not in the margin, I attach little
weight to it, for I am not concerned to say what religious motive the
scribes may have had for acting as they did: possibly they did so from
candour, wishing to transmit the few exemplars of the Bible which they
had found exactly in their original state, marking the differences they
discovered in the margin, not as doubtful readings, but as simple
variants. (123) I have myself called them doubtful readings, because it
would be generally impossible to say which of the two versions is
preferable.

\(124\) Lastly, besides these doubtful readings the scribes have (by
leaving a hiatus in the middle of a paragraph) marked several passages
as mutilated. (125) The Massoretes have counted up such instances, and
they amount to eight-and-twenty. (126) I do not know whether any mystery
is thought to lurk in the number, at any rate the Pharisees religiously
preserve a certain amount of empty space.

\(127\) One of such hiatus occurs (to give an instance) in Gen. iv:8,
where it is written, "And Cain said to his brother . . . . and it came
to pass while they were in the field, &c.," a space being left in which
we should expect to hear what it was that Cain said.

\(128\) Similarly there are (besides those points we have noticed)
eight-and- twenty hiatus left by the scribes. (129) Many of these would
not be recognized as mutilated if it were not for the empty space left.
But I have said enough on this subject.
