### CHAPTER V.—OF THE CEREMONIAL LAW.

\(1\) In the foregoing chapter we have shown that the Divine law, which
renders men truly blessed, and teaches them the true life, is universal
to all men; nay, we have so intimately deduced it from human nature that
it must be esteemed innate, and, as it were, ingrained in the human
mind.

\(2\) But with regard to the ceremonial observances which were ordained
in the Old Testament for the Hebrews only, and were so adapted to their
state that they could for the most part only be observed by the society
as a whole and not by each individual, it is evident that they formed no
part of the Divine law, and had nothing to do with blessedness and
virtue, but had reference only to the election of the Hebrews, that is
(as I have shown in Chap. II.), to their temporal bodily happiness and
the tranquillity of their kingdom, and that therefore they were only
valid while that kingdom lasted. (3) If in the Old Testament they are
spoken of as the law of God, it is only because they were founded on
revelation, or a basis of revelation. (4) Still as reason, however
sound, has little weight with ordinary theologians, I will adduce the
authority of Scripture for what I here assert, and will further show,
for the sake of greater clearness, why and how these ceremonials served
to establish and preserve the Jewish kingdom. (5) Isaiah teaches most
plainly that the Divine law in its strict sense signifies that universal
law which consists in a true manner of life, and does not signify
ceremonial observances. (6) In chapter i:10, the prophet calls on his
countrymen to hearken to the Divine law as he delivers it, and first
excluding all kinds of sacrifices and all feasts, he at length sums up
the law in these few words, "Cease to do evil, learn to do well: seek
judgment, relieve the oppressed." (7) Not less striking testimony is
given in Psalm xl:7- 9, where the Psalmist addresses God: "Sacrifice and
offering Thou didst not desire; mine ears hast Thou opened; burnt
offering and sin-offering hast Thou not required; I delight to do Thy
will, O my God; yea, Thy law is within my heart." (8) Here the Psalmist
reckons as the law of God only that which is inscribed in his heart, and
excludes ceremonies therefrom, for the latter are good and inscribed on
the heart only from the fact of their institution, and not because of
their intrinsic value.

\(9\) Other passages of Scripture testify to the same truth, but these
two will suffice. (10) We may also learn from the Bible that ceremonies
are no aid to blessedness, but only have reference to the temporal
prosperity of the kingdom; for the rewards promised for their observance
are merely temporal advantages and delights, blessedness being reserved
for the universal Divine law. (11) In all the five books commonly
attributed to Moses nothing is promised, as I have said, beyond temporal
benefits, such as honours, fame, victories, riches, enjoyments, and
health. (12) Though many moral precepts besides ceremonies are contained
in these five books, they appear not as moral doctrines universal to all
men, but as commands especially adapted to the understanding and
character of the Hebrew people, and as having reference only to the
welfare of the kingdom. (13) For instance, Moses does not teach the Jews
as a prophet not to kill or to steal, but gives these commandments
solely as a lawgiver and judge; he does not reason out the doctrine, but
affixes for its non-observance a penalty which may and very properly
does vary in different nations. (14) So, too, the command not to commit
adultery is given merely with reference to the welfare of the state; for
if the moral doctrine had been intended, with reference not only to the
welfare of the state, but also to the tranquillity and blessedness of
the individual, Moses would have condemned not merely the outward act,
but also the mental acquiescence, as is done by Christ, Who taught only
universal moral precepts, and for this cause promises a spiritual
instead of a temporal reward. (15) Christ, as I have said, was sent into
the world, not to preserve the state nor to lay down laws, but solely to
teach the universal moral law, so we can easily understand that He
wished in nowise to do away with the law of Moses, inasmuch as He
introduced no new laws of His own—His sole care was to teach moral
doctrines, and distinguish them from the laws of the state; for the
Pharisees, in their ignorance, thought that the observance of the state
law and the Mosaic law was the sum total of morality; whereas such laws
merely had reference to the public welfare, and aimed not so much at
instructing the Jews as at keeping them under constraint. (16) But let
us return to our subject, and cite other passages of Scripture which set
forth temporal benefits as rewards for observing the ceremonial law, and
blessedness as reward for the universal law.

\(17\) None of the prophets puts the point more clearly than Isaiah.
(18.) After condemning hypocrisy he commends liberty and charity towards
one's self and one's neighbours, and promises as a reward: "Then shall
thy light break forth as the morning, and thy health shall spring forth
speedily, thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of the
Lord shall be thy reward" (chap. lviii:8). (19) Shortly afterwards he
commends the Sabbath, and for a due observance of it, promises: "Then
shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord, and I will cause thee to ride
upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of
Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it." (20) Thus
the prophet for liberty bestowed, and charitable works, promises a
healthy mind in a healthy body, and the glory of the Lord even after
death; whereas, for ceremonial exactitude, he only promises security of
rule, prosperity, and temporal happiness.

\(21\) In Psalms xv. and xxiv. no mention is made of ceremonies, but
only of moral doctrines, inasmuch as there is no question of anything
but blessedness, and blessedness is symbolically promised: it is quite
certain that the expressions, "the hill of God," and "His tents and the
dwellers therein," refer to blessedness and security of soul, not to the
actual mount of Jerusalem and the tabernacle of Moses, for these latter
were not dwelt in by anyone, and only the sons of Levi ministered there.
(22) Further, all those sentences of Solomon to which I referred in the
last chapter, for the cultivation of the intellect and wisdom, promise
true blessedness, for by wisdom is the fear of God at length understood,
and the knowledge of God found.

\(23\) That the Jews themselves were not bound to practise their
ceremonial observances after the destruction of their kingdom is evident
from Jeremiah. (24) For when the prophet saw and foretold that the
desolation of the city was at hand, he said that God only delights in
those who know and understand that He exercises loving-kindness,
judgment, and righteousness in the earth, and that such persons only are
worthy of praise. (Jer. ix:23.) (25) As though God had said that, after
the desolation of the city, He would require nothing special from the
Jews beyond the natural law by which all men are bound.

\(26\) The New Testament also confirms this view, for only moral
doctrines are therein taught, and the kingdom of heaven is promised as a
reward, whereas ceremonial observances are not touched on by the
Apostles, after they began to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles. (27)
The Pharisees certainly continued to practise these rites after the
destruction of the kingdom, but more with a view of opposing the
Christians than of pleasing God: for after the first destruction of the
city, when they were led captive to Babylon, not being then, so far as I
am aware, split up into sects, they straightway neglected their rites,
bid farewell to the Mosaic law, buried their national customs in
oblivion as being plainly superfluous, and began to mingle with other
nations, as we may abundantly learn from Ezra and Nehemiah. (28) We
cannot, therefore, doubt that they were no more bound by the law of
Moses, after the destruction of their kingdom, than they had been before
it had been begun, while they were still living among other peoples
before the exodus from Egypt, and were subject to no special law beyond
the natural law, and also, doubtless, the law of the state in which they
were living, in so far as it was consonant with the Divine natural law.

\(29\) As to the fact that the patriarchs offered sacrifices, I think
they did so for the purpose of stimulating their piety, for their minds
had been accustomed from childhood to the idea of sacrifice, which we
know had been universal from the time of Enoch; and thus they found in
sacrifice their most powerful incentive. (30) The patriarchs, then, did
not sacrifice to God at the bidding of a Divine right, or as taught by
the basis of the Divine law, but simply in accordance with the custom of
the time; and, if in so doing they followed any ordinance, it was simply
the ordinance of the country they were living in, by which (as we have
seen before in the case of Melchisedek) they were bound.

\(31\) I think that I have now given Scriptural authority for my view:
it remains to show why and how the ceremonial observances tended to
preserve and confirm the Hebrew kingdom; and this I can very briefly do
on grounds universally accepted.

\(32\) The formation of society serves not only for defensive purposes,
but is also very useful, and, indeed, absolutely necessary, as rendering
possible the division of labour. (33) If men did not render mutual
assistance to each other, no one would have either the skill or the time
to provide for his own sustenance and preservation: for all men are not
equally apt for all work, and no one would be capable of preparing all
that he individually stood in need of. (34) Strength and time, I repeat,
would fail, if every one had in person to plough, to sow, to reap, to
grind corn, to cook, to weave, to stitch, and perform the other numerous
functions required to keep life going; to say nothing of the arts and
sciences which are also entirely necessary to the perfection and
blessedness of human nature. (35) We see that peoples living, in
uncivilized barbarism lead a wretched and almost animal life, and even
they would not be able to acquire their few rude necessaries without
assisting one another to a certain extent.

\(36\) Now if men were so constituted by nature that they desired
nothing but what is designated by true reason, society would obviously
have no need of laws: it would be sufficient to inculcate true moral
doctrines; and men would freely, without hesitation, act in accordance
with their true interests. (37) But human nature is framed in a
different fashion: every one, indeed, seeks his own interest, but does
not do so in accordance with the dictates of sound reason, for most
men's ideas of desirability and usefulness are guided by their fleshly
instincts and emotions, which take no thought beyond the present and the
immediate object. (38) Therefore, no society can exist without
government, and force, and laws to restrain and repress men's desires
and immoderate impulses. (39) Still human nature will not submit to
absolute repression. (40) Violent governments, as Seneca says, never
last long; the moderate governments endure. (41) So long as men act
simply from fear they act contrary to their inclinations, taking no
thought for the advantages or necessity of their actions, but simply
endeavouring to escape punishment or loss of life. (42) They must needs
rejoice in any evil which befalls their ruler, even if it should involve
themselves; and must long for and bring about such evil by every means
in their power. (43) Again, men are especially intolerant of serving and
being ruled by their equals. (44) Lastly, it is exceedingly difficult to
revoke liberties once granted.

\(45\) From these considerations it follows, firstly, that authority
should either be vested in the hands of the whole state in common, so
that everyone should be bound to serve, and yet not be in subjection to
his equals; or else, if power be in the hands of a few, or one man, that
one man should be something above average humanity, or should strive to
get himself accepted as such. (46) Secondly, laws should in every
government be so arranged that people should be kept in bounds by the
hope of some greatly desired good, rather than by fear, for then
everyone will do his duty willingly.

\(47\) Lastly, as obedience consists in acting at the bidding of
external authority, it would have no place in a state where the
government is vested in the whole people, and where laws are made by
common consent. (48) In such a society the people would remain free,
whether the laws were added to or diminished, inasmuch as it would not
be done on external authority, but their own free consent. (49) The
reverse happens when the sovereign power is vested in one man, for all
act at his bidding; and, therefore, unless they had been trained from
the first to depend on the words of their ruler, the latter would find
it difficult, in case of need, to abrogate liberties once conceded, and
impose new laws.

\(50\) From these universal considerations, let us pass on to the
kingdom of the Jews. (51) The Jews when they first came out of Egypt
were not bound by any national laws, and were therefore free to ratify
any laws they liked, or to make new ones, and were at liberty to set up
a government and occupy a territory wherever they chose. (52) However,
they, were entirely unfit to frame a wise code of laws and to keep the
sovereign power vested in the community; they were all uncultivated and
sunk in a wretched slavery, therefore the sovereignty was bound to
remain vested in the hands of one man who would rule the rest and keep
them under constraint, make laws and interpret them. (53) This
sovereignty was easily retained by Moses, because he surpassed the rest
in virtue and persuaded the people of the fact, proving it by many
testimonies (see Exod. chap. xiv., last verse, and chap. xix:9). (54) He
then, by the Divine virtue he possessed, made laws and ordained them for
the people, taking the greatest care that they should be obeyed
willingly and not through fear, being specially induced to adopt this
course by the obstinate nature of the Jews, who would not have submitted
to be ruled solely by constraint; and also by the imminence of war, for
it is always better to inspire soldiers with a thirst for glory than to
terrify them with threats; each man will then strive to distinguish
himself by valour and courage, instead of merely trying to escape
punishment. (55) Moses, therefore, by his virtue and the Divine command,
introduced a religion, so that the people might do their duty from
devotion rather than fear. (56) Further, he bound them over by benefits,
and prophesied many advantages in the future; nor were his laws very
severe, as anyone may see for himself, especially if he remarks the
number of circumstances necessary in order to procure the conviction of
an accused person.

\(57\) Lastly, in order that the people which could not govern itself
should be entirely dependent on its ruler, he left nothing to the free
choice of individuals (who had hitherto been slaves); the people could
do nothing but remember the law, and follow the ordinances laid down at
the good pleasure of their ruler; they were not allowed to plough, to
sow, to reap, nor even to eat; to clothe themselves, to shave, to
rejoice, or in fact to do anything whatever as they liked, but were
bound to follow the directions given in the law; and not only this, but
they were obliged to have marks on their door-posts, on their hands, and
between their eyes to admonish them to perpetual obedience.

\(58\) This, then, was the object of the ceremonial law, that men should
do nothing of their own free will, but should always act under external
authority, and should continually confess by their actions and thoughts
that they were not their own masters, but were entirely under the
control of others.

\(59\) From all these considerations it is clearer than day that
ceremonies have nothing to do with a state of blessedness, and that
those mentioned in the Old Testament, i.e. the whole Mosaic Law, had
reference merely to the government of the Jews, and merely temporal
advantages.

\(60\) As for the Christian rites, such as baptism, the Lord's Supper,
festivals, public prayers, and any other observances which are, and
always have been, common to all Christendom, if they were instituted by
Christ or His Apostles (which is open to doubt), they were instituted as
external signs of the universal church, and not as having anything to do
with blessedness, or possessing any sanctity in themselves. (61)
Therefore, though such ceremonies were not ordained for the sake of
upholding a government, they were ordained for the preservation of a
society, and accordingly he who lives alone is not bound by them: nay,
those who live in a country where the Christian religion is forbidden,
are bound to abstain from such rites, and can none the less live in a
state of blessedness. (62) We have an example of this in Japan, where
the Christian religion is forbidden, and the Dutch who live there are
enjoined by their East India Company not to practise any outward rites
of religion. (63) I need not cite other examples, though it would be
easy to prove my point from the fundamental principles of the New
Testament, and to adduce many confirmatory instances; but I pass on the
more willingly, as I am anxious to proceed to my next proposition. (64)
I will now, therefore, pass on to what I proposed to treat of in the
second part of this chapter, namely, what persons are bound to believe
in the narratives contained in Scripture, and how far they are so bound.
(65) Examining this question by the aid of natural reason, I will
proceed as follows.

\(66\) If anyone wishes to persuade his fellows for or against anything
which is not self-evident, he must deduce his contention from their
admissions, and convince them either by experience or by ratiocination;
either by appealing to facts of natural experience, or to self-evident
intellectual axioms. (67) Now unless the experience be of such a kind as
to be clearly and distinctly understood, though it may convince a man,
it will not have the same effect on his mind and disperse the clouds of
his doubt so completely as when the doctrine taught is deduced entirely
from intellectual axioms—that is, by the mere power of the understanding
and logical order, and this is especially the case in spiritual matters
which have nothing to do with the senses.

\(68\) But the deduction of conclusions from general truths . priori,
usually requires a long chain of arguments, and, moreover, very great
caution, acuteness, and self-restraint—qualities which are not often met
with; therefore people prefer to be taught by experience rather than
deduce their conclusion from a few axioms, and set them out in logical
order. (69) Whence it follows, that if anyone wishes to teach a doctrine
to a whole nation (not to speak of the whole human race), and to be
understood by all men in every particular, he will seek to support his
teaching with experience, and will endeavour to suit his reasonings and
the definitions of his doctrines as far as possible to the understanding
of the common people, who form the majority of mankind, and he will not
set them forth in logical sequence nor adduce the definitions which
serve to establish them. (70) Otherwise he writes only for the
learned—that is, he will be understood by only a small proportion of the
human race.

\(71\) All Scripture was written primarily for an entire people, and
secondarily for the whole human race; therefore its contents must
necessarily be adapted as far as possible to the understanding of the
masses, and proved only by examples drawn from experience. (72) We will
explain ourselves more clearly. (73) The chief speculative doctrines
taught in Scripture are the existence of God, or a Being Who made all
things, and Who directs and sustains the world with consummate wisdom;
furthermore, that God takes the greatest thought for men, or such of
them as live piously and honourably, while He punishes, with various
penalties, those who do evil, separating them from the good. (74) All
this is proved in Scripture entirely through experience-that is, through
the narratives there related. (75) No definitions of doctrine are given,
but all the sayings and reasonings are adapted to the understanding of
the masses. (76) Although experience can give no clear knowledge of
these things, nor explain the nature of God, nor how He directs and
sustains all things, it can nevertheless teach and enlighten men
sufficiently to impress obedience and devotion on their minds.

\(77\) It is now, I think, sufficiently clear what persons are bound to
believe in the Scripture narratives, and in what degree they are so
bound, for it evidently follows from what has been said that the
knowledge of and belief in them is particularly necessary to the masses
whose intellect is not capable of perceiving things clearly and
distinctly. (78) Further, he who denies them because he does not believe
that God exists or takes thought for men and the world, may be accounted
impious; but a man who is ignorant of them, and nevertheless knows by
natural reason that God exists, as we have said, and has a true plan of
life, is altogether blessed—yes, more blessed than the common herd of
believers, because besides true opinions he possesses also a true and
distinct conception. (79) Lastly, he who is ignorant of the Scriptures
and knows nothing by the light of reason, though he may not be impious
or rebellious, is yet less than human and almost brutal, having none of
God's gifts.

\(80\) We must here remark that when we say that the knowledge of the
sacred narrative is particularly necessary to the masses, we do not mean
the knowledge of absolutely all the narratives in the Bible, but only of
the principal ones, those which, taken by themselves, plainly display
the doctrine we have just stated, and have most effect over men's minds.

\(81\) If all the narratives in Scripture were necessary for the proof
of this doctrine, and if no conclusion could be drawn without the
general consideration of every one of the histories contained in the
sacred writings, truly the conclusion and demonstration of such doctrine
would overtask the understanding and strength not only of the masses,
but of humanity; who is there who could give attention to all the
narratives at once, and to all the circumstances, and all the scraps of
doctrine to be elicited from such a host of diverse histories? (82) I
cannot believe that the men who have left us the Bible as we have it
were so abounding in talent that they attempted setting about such a
method of demonstration, still less can I suppose that we cannot
understand Scriptural doctrine till we have given heed to the quarrels
of Isaac, the advice of Achitophel to Absalom, the civil war between
Jews and Israelites, and other similar chronicles; nor can I think that
it was more difficult to teach such doctrine by means of history to the
Jews of early times, the contemporaries of Moses, than it was to the
contemporaries of Esdras. (83) But more will be said on this point
hereafter, we may now only note that the masses are only bound to know
those histories which can most powerfully dispose their mind to
obedience and devotion. (84) However, the masses are not sufficiently
skilled to draw conclusions from what they read, they take more delight
in the actual stories, and in the strange and unlooked-for issues of
events than in the doctrines implied; therefore, besides reading these
narratives, they are always in need of pastors or church ministers to
explain them to their feeble intelligence.

\(85\) But not to wander from our point, let us conclude with what has
been our principal object—namely, that the truth of narratives, be they
what they may, has nothing to do with the Divine law, and serves for
nothing except in respect of doctrine, the sole element which makes one
history better than another. (86) The narratives in the Old and New
Testaments surpass profane history, and differ among themselves in merit
simply by reason of the salutary doctrines which they inculcate. (87)
Therefore, if a man were to read the Scripture narratives believing the
whole of them, but were to give no heed to the doctrines they contain,
and make no amendment in his life, he might employ himself just as
profitably in reading the Koran or the poetic drama, or ordinary
chronicles, with the attention usually given to such writings; on the
other hand, if a man is absolutely ignorant of the Scriptures, and none
the less has right opinions and a true plan of life, he is absolutely
blessed and truly possesses in himself the spirit of Christ.

\(88\) The Jews are of a directly contrary way of thinking, for they
hold that true opinions and a true plan of life are of no service in
attaining blessedness, if their possessors have arrived at them by the
light of reason only, and not like the documents prophetically revealed
to Moses. (89) Maimonides ventures openly to make this assertion: "Every
man who takes to heart the seven precepts and diligently follows them,
is counted with the pious among the nation, and an heir of the world to
come; that is to say, if he takes to heart and follows them because God
ordained them in the law, and revealed them to us by Moses, because they
were of aforetime precepts to the sons of Noah: but he who follows them
as led thereto by reason, is not counted as a dweller among the pious or
among the wise of the nations." (90) Such are the words Of Maimonides,
to which R. Joseph, the son of Shem Job, adds in his book which he calls
"Kebod Elohim, or God's Glory," that although Aristotle (whom he
considers to have written the best ethics and to be above everyone else)
has not omitted anything that concerns true ethics, and which he has
adopted in his own book, carefully following the lines laid down, yet
this was not able to suffice for his salvation, inasmuch as he embraced
his doctrines in accordance with the dictates of reason and not as
Divine documents prophetically revealed.

\(91\) However, that these are mere figments, and are not supported by
Scriptural authority will, I think, be sufficiently evident to the
attentive reader, so that an examination of the theory will be
sufficient for its refutation. (92) It is not my purpose here to refute
the assertions of those who assert that the natural light of reason can
teach nothing, of any value concerning the true way of salvation. (93)
People who lay no claims to reason for themselves, are not able to prove
by reason this their assertion; and if they hawk about something
superior to reason, it is a mere figment, and far below reason, as their
general method of life sufficiently shows. (94) But there is no need to
dwell upon such persons. (95) I will merely add that we can only judge
of a man by his works. (96) If a man abounds in the fruits of the
Spirit, charity, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,
gentleness, chastity, against which, as Paul says (Gal. v:22), there is
no law, such an one, whether he be taught by reason only or by the
Scripture only, has been in very truth taught by God, and is altogether
blessed. (97) Thus have I said all that I undertook to say concerning
Divine law.
