### CHAPTER XIII—IT IS SHOWN THAT SCRIPTURE TEACHES ONLY VERY SIMPLE DOCTRINES, SUCH AS SUFFICE FOR RIGHT CONDUCT.

\(1\) In the second chapter of this treatise we pointed out that the
prophets were gifted with extraordinary powers of imagination, but not
of understanding; also that God only revealed to them such things as are
very simple—not philosophic mysteries,—and that He adapted His
communications to their previous opinions. (2) We further showed in
Chap. V. that Scripture only transmits and teaches truths which can
readily be comprehended by all; not deducing and concatenating its
conclusions from definitions and axioms, but narrating quite simply, and
confirming its statements, with a view to inspiring belief, by an appeal
to experience as exemplified in miracles and history, and setting forth
its truths in the style and phraseology which would most appeal to the
popular mind (cf. Chap. VI., third division).

\(3\) Lastly, we demonstrated in Chap. VIII. that the difficulty of
understanding Scripture lies in the language only, and not in the
abstruseness of the argument.

\(4\) To these considerations we may add that the Prophets did not
preach only to the learned, but to all Jews, without exception, while
the Apostles were wont to teach the gospel doctrine in churches where
there were public meetings; whence it follows that Scriptural doctrine
contains no lofty speculations nor philosophic reasoning, but only very
simple matters, such as could be understood by the slowest intelligence.

\(5\) I am consequently lost in wonder at the ingenuity of those whom I
have already mentioned, who detect in the Bible mysteries so profound
that they cannot be explained in human language, and who have introduced
so many philosophic speculations into religion that the Church seems
like an academy, and religion like a science, or rather a dispute.

\(6\) It is not to be wondered at that men, who boast of possessing
supernatural intelligence, should be unwilling to yield the palm of
knowledge to philosophers who have only their ordinary, faculties; still
I should be surprised if I found them teaching any new speculative
doctrine, which was not a commonplace to those Gentile philosophers
whom, in spite of all, they stigmatize as blind; for, if one inquires
what these mysteries lurking in Scripture may be, one is confronted with
nothing but the reflections of Plato or Aristotle, or the like, which it
would often be easier for an ignorant man to dream than for the most
accomplished scholar to wrest out of the Bible.

\(7\) However, I do not wish to affirm absolutely that Scripture
contains no doctrines in the sphere of philosophy, for in the last
chapter I pointed out some of the kind, as fundamental principles; but I
go so far as to say that such doctrines are very few and very simple.
(8) Their precise nature and definition I will now set forth. (9) The
task will be easy, for we know that Scripture does not aim at imparting
scientific knowledge, and, therefore, it demands from men nothing but
obedience, and censures obstinacy, but not ignorance.

\(10\) Furthermore, as obedience to God consists solely in love to our
neighbour—for whosoever loveth his neighbour, as a means of obeying God,
hath, as St. Paul says (Rom. xiii:8), fulfilled the law,—it follows that
no knowledge is commended in the Bible save that which is necessary for
enabling all men to obey God in the manner stated, and without which
they would become rebellious, or without the discipline of obedience.

\(11\) Other speculative questions, which have no direct bearing on this
object, or are concerned with the knowledge of natural events, do not
affect Scripture, and should be entirely separated from religion.

\(12\) Now, though everyone, as we have said, is now quite able to see
this truth for himself, I should nevertheless wish, considering that the
whole of Religion depends thereon, to explain the entire question more
accurately and clearly. (13) To this end I must first prove that the
intellectual or accurate knowledge of God is not a gift, bestowed upon
all good men like obedience; and, further, that the knowledge of God,
required by Him through His prophets from everyone without exception, as
needful to be known, is simply a knowledge of His Divine justice and
charity. (14) Both these points are easily proved from Scripture. (15)
The first plainly follows from Exodus vi:2, where God, in order to show
the singular grace bestowed upon Moses, says to him: "And I appeared
unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by the name of El Sadai (A. V.
God Almighty); but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them"—for the
better understanding of which passage I may remark that El Sadai, in
Hebrew, signifies the God who suffices, in that He gives to every man
that which suffices for him; and, although Sadai is often used by
itself, to signify God, we cannot doubt that the word El (God, ) is
everywhere understood. (16) Furthermore, we must note that Jehovah is
the only word found in Scripture with the meaning of the absolute
essence of God, without reference to created things. (17) The Jews
maintain, for this reason, that this is, strictly speaking, the only
name of God; that the rest of the words used are merely titles; and, in
truth, the other names of God, whether they be substantives or
adjectives, are merely attributive, and belong to Him, in so far as He
is conceived of in relation to created things, or manifested through
them. (18) Thus El, or Eloah, signifies powerful, as is well known, and
only applies to God in respect to His supremacy, as when we call Paul an
apostle; the faculties of his power are set forth in an accompanying
adjective, as El, great, awful, just, merciful, &c., or else all are
understood at once by the use of El in the plural number, with a
singular signification, an expression frequently adopted in Scripture.

\(19\) Now, as God tells Moses that He was not known to the patriarchs
by the name of Jehovah, it follows that they were not cognizant of any
attribute of God which expresses His absolute essence, but only of His
deeds and promises that is, of His power, as manifested in visible
things. (20) God does not thus speak to Moses in order to accuse the
patriarchs of infidelity, but, on the contrary, as a means of extolling
their belief and faith, inasmuch as, though they possessed no
extraordinary knowledge of God (such as Moses had), they yet accepted
His promises as fixed and certain; whereas Moses, though his thoughts
about God were more exalted, nevertheless doubted about the Divine
promises, and complained to God that, instead of the promised
deliverance, the prospects of the Israelites had darkened.

\(21\) As the patriarchs did not know the distinctive name of God, and
as God mentions the fact to Moses, in praise of their faith and
single-heartedness, and in contrast to the extraordinary grace granted
to Moses, it follows, as we stated at first, that men are not bound by,
decree to have knowledge of the attributes of God, such knowledge being
only granted to a few of the faithful: it is hardly worth while to quote
further examples from Scripture, for everyone must recognize that
knowledge of God is not equal among all good men. (22) Moreover, a man
cannot be ordered to be wise any more than he can be ordered to live and
exist. (23) Men, women, and children are all alike able to obey by,
commandment, but not to be wise. If any tell us that it is not necessary
to understand the Divine attributes, but that we must believe them
simply, without proof, he is plainly, trifling. (24) For what is
invisible and can only, be perceived by the mind, cannot be apprehended
by any, other means than proofs; if these are absent the object remains
ungrasped; the repetition of what has been heard on such subjects no
more indicates or attains to their meaning than the words of a parrot or
a puppet speaking without sense or signification.

\(25\) Before I proceed I ought to explain how it comes that we are
often told in Genesis that the patriarchs preached in the name of
Jehovah, this being in plain contradiction to the text above quoted.
(26) A reference to what was said in Chap. VIII. will readily explain
the difficulty. (27) It was there shown that the writer of the
Pentateuch did not always speak of things and places by the names they
bore in the times of which he was writing, but by the names best known
to his contemporaries. (28) God is thus said in the Pentateuch to have
been preached by the patriarchs under the name of Jehovah, not because
such was the name by which the patriarchs knew Him, but because this
name was the one most reverenced by the Jews. (29) This point, I say,
must necessarily be noticed, for in Exodus it is expressly stated that
God was not known to the patriarchs by this name; and in chap. iii:13,
it is said that Moses desired to know the name of God. (30) Now, if this
name had been already known it would have been known to Moses. (31) We
must therefore draw the conclusion indicated, namely, that the faithful
patriarchs did not know this name of God, and that the knowledge of God
is bestowed and not commanded by the Deity.

\(32\) It is now time to pass on to our second point, and show that God
through His prophets required from men no other knowledge of Himself
than is contained in a knowledge of His justice and charity—that is, of
attributes which a certain manner of life will enable men to imitate.
(33) Jeremiah states this in so many words (xxii:15, 16): "Did not thy
father eat, and drink, and do judgment and justice? and then it was well
with him. (34) He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was
well with him: was not this to know Me? saith the Lord." (35) The words
in chap. ix:24 of the same book are equally, clear. (36) "But let him
that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me, that
I am the Lord which exercise loving- kindness, judgment, and
righteousness in the earth; for in these things I delight, saith the
Lord." (37) The same doctrine maybe gathered from Exod. xxxiv:6, where
God revealed to Moses only, those of His attributes which display the
Divine justice and charity. (38) Lastly, we may call attention to a
passage in John which we shall discuss at more length hereafter; the
Apostle explains the nature of God (inasmuch as no one has beheld Him)
through charity only, and concludes that he who possesses charity
possesses, and in very, truth knows God.

\(39\) We have thus seen that Moses, Jeremiah, and John sum up in a very
short compass the knowledge of God needful for all, and that they state
it to consist in exactly what we said, namely, that God is supremely
just, and supremely merciful—in other words, the one perfect pattern of
the true life. (40) We may add that Scripture nowhere gives an express
definition of God, and does not point out any other of His attributes
which should be apprehended save these, nor does it in set terms praise
any others. (41) Wherefore we may draw the general conclusion that an
intellectual knowledge of God, which takes cognizance of His nature in
so far as it actually is, and which cannot by any manner of living be
imitated by mankind or followed as an example, has no bearing whatever
on true rules of conduct, on faith, or on revealed religion;
consequently that men may be in complete error on the subject without
incurring the charge of sinfulness. (42) We need now no longer wonder
that God adapted Himself to the existing opinions and imaginations of
the prophets, or that the faithful held different ideas of God, as we
showed in Chap. II.; or, again, that the sacred books speak very
inaccurately of God, attributing to Him hands, feet, eyes, ears, a mind,
and motion from one place to another; or that they ascribe to Him
emotions, such as jealousy, mercy, &c., or, lastly, that they describe
Him as a Judge in heaven sitting on a royal throne with Christ on His
right hand. (43) Such expressions are adapted to the understanding of
the multitude, it being the object of the Bible to make men not learned
but obedient.

\(44\) In spite of this the general run of theologians, when they come
upon any of these phrases which they cannot rationally harmonize with
the Divine nature, maintain that they should be interpreted
metaphorically, passages they cannot understand they say should be
interpreted literally. (45) But if every expression of this kind in the
Bible is necessarily to be interpreted and understood metaphorically,
Scripture must have been written, not for the people and the unlearned
masses, but chiefly for accomplished experts and philosophers.

\(46\) If it were indeed a sin to hold piously and simply the ideas
about God we have just quoted, the prophets ought to have been strictly
on their guard against the use of such expressions, seeing the
weak-mindedness of the people, and ought, on the other hand, to have set
forth first of all, duly and clearly, those attributes of God which are
needful to be understood.

\(47\) This they have nowhere done; we cannot, therefore, think that
opinions taken in themselves without respect to actions are either pious
or impious, but must maintain that a man is pious or impious in his
beliefs only in so far as he is thereby incited to obedience, or derives
from them license to sin and rebel. (48) If a man, by believing what is
true, becomes rebellious, his creed is impious; if by believing what is
false he becomes obedient, his creed is pious; for the true knowledge of
God comes not by commandment, but by Divine gift. (49) God has required
nothing from man but a knowledge of His Divine justice and charity, and
that not as necessary to scientific accuracy, but to obedience.
