<p align="center">CHAPTER XI&#8212;An Inquiry whether the Apostles wrote their</p>  
<p>Epistles as Apostles and Prophets, or merely as Teachers, and an Explanation of what is meant by Apostle.</p>  
<p>The epistles not in the prophetic style.</p>  
<p>The Apostles not commanded to write or preach in particular places.</p>  
<p>Different methods of teaching adopted by the Apostles.</p>  
<p align="center">CHAPTER XII&#8212;Of the true Original of the Divine Law,</p>  
<p>and wherefore Scripture is called Sacred, and the Word of God. How that, in so far as it contains the Word of God, it has come down to us uncorrupted.</p>  
<p align="center">CHAPTER XIII&#8212;It is shown, that Scripture teaches only very Simple Doctrines,</p>  
<p>such as suffice for right conduct.</p>  
<p>Error in speculative doctrine not impious&#8212;nor knowledge pious. Piety consists in obedience.</p>  
<p align="center">CHAPTER XIV&#8212;Definitions of Faith, the True Faith, and the Foundations of Faith, which is once for all separated from Philosophy.</p>  
<p>Danger resulting from the vulgar idea of faith.</p>  
<p>The only test of faith obedience and good works.</p>  
<p>As different men are disposed to obedience by different opinions, universal faith can contain only the simplest doctrines.</p>  
<p>Fundamental distinction between faith and philosophy&#8212;the key-stone of the present treatise.</p>  
<p align="center">CHAPTER XV&#8212;Theology is shown not to be subservient to</p>  
<p>Reason, nor Reason to Theology: a Definition of the reason which enables us to accept the Authority of the Bible.</p>  
<p>Theory that Scripture must be accommodated to Reason&#8212;maintained by Maimonides&#8212;already refuted in Chapter vii.</p>  
<p>Theory that Reason must be accommodated to Scripture&#8212;maintained by Alpakhar&#8212;examined.</p>  
<p>And refuted.</p>  
<p>Scripture and Reason independent of one another.</p>  
<p>Certainty, of fundamental faith not mathematical but moral.</p>  
<p>Great utility of Revelation.</p>  
<p>Authors Endnotes to the Treatise.</p>
