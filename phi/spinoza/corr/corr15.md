*Correspondence*, by Benedict de Spinoza, \[1883\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### LETTER XVIII. (LXII.)

#### OLDENBURG TO SPINOZA.

\[*Oldenburg rejoices at the renewal of correspondence, and alludes to
the five books of the Ethics which Spinoza (in a letter now lost) had
announced his intention of publishing*.\]

Our correspondence being thus happily renewed, I should be unwilling to
fall short of a friend's duty in the exchange of letters. I understand
from your answer delivered to me on July 5, that you intend to publish
your treatise in five parts. Allow me, I beg, to warn you by the
sincerity of your affection for me, not to insert any passages which may
seem to discourage the practice of religion and virtue; especially as
nothing is more sought after in this degenerate and evil age than
doctrines of the kind, which seem to give countenance to rampant vice.

However, I will not object to receiving a few copies of the said
treatise. I will only ask you that, when the time arrives, they may be
entrusted to a Dutch merchant living in London, who will see that they
are forwarded to

me. There is no need to mention, that books of the kind in question have
been sent to me: if they arrive safely to my keeping, I do not doubt
that I can conveniently dispose of some copies to my friends here and
there, and can obtain a just price for them. Farewell, and when you have
leisure write to

Yours most zealously,  
HENRY OLDENBURG.

London, 22 July, 1675.
