### LETTER XXXVI. (XXIII.)

#### SPINOZA TO BLYENBERGH.

\[*Spinoza replies, that there is a difference between the theological
and the philosophical way of speaking of God and things divine. He
proceeds to discuss Blyenbergh's questions*. (Voorburg, 13th March,
1665)\]

<span class="smallcaps">Friend and Sir</span>,—I have received two
letters from you this week; the second, dated 9th March, only served to
inform

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

me of the first written on February 19th, and sent to me at Schiedam. In
the former I see that you complain of my saying, that "demonstration
carried no weight with you," as though I had spoken of my own arguments,
which had failed to convince you. Such was far from my intention. I was
referring to your own words, which rant as follows:—"And if after long
investigation it comes to pass, that my natural knowledge appears either
to be at variance with the word (of Scripture), or not sufficiently
well, &c.; the word has so great authority with me, that I would rather
doubt of the conceptions, which I think I clearly perceive," &c. You see
I merely repeat in brief your own phrase, so that I cannot think you
have any cause for anger against me, especially as I merely quoted in.
order to show the great difference between our standpoints.

Again, as you wrote at the end of your letter that your only hope and
wish is to continue in faith and hope, and that all else, which we may
become convinced of through our natural faculties, is indifferent to
you; I reflected, as I still continue to do, that my letters could be of
no use to you, and that I should best consult my own interests by
ceasing to neglect my pursuits (which I am compelled while writing to
you to interrupt) for the sake of things which could bring no possible
benefit. Nor is this contrary to the spirit of my former letter, for in
that I looked upon you as simply a philosopher, who (like not a few who
call themselves Christians) possesses no touchstone of truth save his
natural understanding, and not as a theologian. However, you have taught
me to know better, and have also shown me that the foundation, on which
I was minded to build up our friendship, has not, as I imagined, been
laid.

As for the rest, such are the general accompaniments of controversy, so
that I would not on that account transgress the limits of courtesy: I
will, therefore, pass over in your second letter, and in this, these and
similar expressions, as though they had never been observed. So much for
your taking offence; to show you that I have given you no just cause,
and, also, that I am quite willing to brook contradiction. I now turn a
second time to answering your objections.

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

I maintain, in the first place, that God is absolutely and really the
cause of all things which have essence, whatsoever they may be. If you
can demonstrate that evil, error, crime, &c., have any positive
existence, which expresses essence, I will fully grant you that God is
the cause of crime, evil, error, &c. I believe myself to have
sufficiently shown, that that which constitutes the reality of evil,
error, crime, &c., does not consist in anything, which expresses
essence, and therefore we cannot say that God is its cause. For
instance, Nero's matricide, in so far as it comprehended anything
positive, was not a crime; the same outward act was perpetrated, and the
same matricidal intention was entertained by Orestes; who, nevertheless,
is not blamed—at any rate, not so much as Nero. Wherein, then, did
Nero's crime consist? In nothing else, but that by his deed he showed
himself to be ungrateful, unmerciful, and disobedient. Certainly none of
these qualities express aught of essence, therefore God was not the
cause of them, though He was the cause of Nero's act and intention.

Further, I would have you observe, that, while we speak philosophically,
we ought not to employ theological phrases. For, since theology
frequently, and not unwisely, represents God as a perfect man, it is
often expedient in theology to say, that God desires a given thing, that
He is angry at the actions of the wicked, and delights in those of the
good. But in philosophy, when we clearly perceive that the attributes
which make men perfect can as ill be ascribed and assigned to God, as
the attributes which go to make perfect the elephant and the ass can be
ascribed to man; here I say these and similar phrases have no place, nor
can we employ them without causing extreme confusion in our conceptions.
Hence, in the language of philosophy, it cannot be said that God desires
anything of any man, or that anything is displeasing or pleasing to Him:
all these are human qualities and have no place in God.

I would have it observed, that although the actions of the good (that is
of those who have a clear idea of God, whereby all their actions and
their thoughts are determined) and of the wicked (that is of those who
do not possess the idea of God, but only the ideas of earthly

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

things, whereby their actions and thoughts are determined), and, in
fact, of all things that are, necessarily flow from God's eternal laws
and decrees; yet they do not differ from one another in degree only, but
also in essence. A mouse no less than an angel, and sorrow no less than
joy depend on God; yet a mouse is not a kind of angel, neither is sorrow
a kind of joy. I think I have thus answered your objections, if I
rightly understand them, for I sometimes doubt, whether the conclusions
which you deduce are not foreign to the proposition you are undertaking
to prove.

However, this will appear more clearly, if I answer the questions you
proposed on these principles. First, Whether murder is as acceptable to
God as alms-giving? Secondly, Whether stealing is as good in relation to
God as honesty? Thirdly and lastly, Whether if there be a mind so
framed, that it would agree with, rather than be repugnant to its proper
nature, to give way to lust, and to commit crimes, whether, I repeat,
there can be any reason given, why such a mind should do good and eschew
evil?

To your first question, I answer, that I do not know, speaking as a
philosopher, what you mean by the words "acceptable to God." If you ask,
whether God does not hate the wicked, and love the good? whether God
does not regard the former with dislike, and the latter with favour? I
answer, No. If the meaning of your question is: Are murderers and
almsgivers equally good and perfect? my answer is again in the negative.
To your second question, I reply: If, by " good in relation to God," you
mean that the honest man confers a favour on God, and the thief does Him
an injury, I answer that neither the honest man nor the thief can cause
God any pleasure or displeasure. If you mean to ask, whether the actions
of each, in so far as they [possess](errata.htm#5.md) reality, and are
caused by God, are equally perfect? I reply that, if we merely regard
the actions and the manner of their execution, both may be equally
perfect. If you, therefore, inquire whether the thief and the honest man
are equally perfect and blessed? I answer, No. For, by an honest man, I
mean one who always desires, that everyone should possess that which is
his. This desire, as I prove in my Ethics (as yet unpublished),

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

necessarily derives its origin in the pious from the clear knowledge
which they possess, of God and of themselves. As a thief has no desire
of the kind, he is necessarily without the knowledge of God and of
himself—in other words, without the chief element of our blessedness. If
you further ask, What causes you to perform a given action, which I call
virtuous, rather than another? I reply, that I cannot know which method,
out of the infinite methods at His disposal, God employs to determine
you to the said action. It may be, that God has impressed you with a
clear idea of Himself, so that you forget the world for love of Him, and
love your fellow-men as yourself; it is plain that such a disposition is
at variance with those dispositions which are called bad, and,
therefore, could not co-exist with them in the same man.

However, this is not the place to expound all the foundations of my
Ethics, or to prove all that I have advanced; I am now only concerned in
answering your questions, and defending myself against them.

Lastly, as to your third question, it assumes a contradiction, and seems
to me to be, as though one asked: If it agreed better with a man's
nature that he should hang himself, could any reasons be given for his
not hanging himself? Can such a nature possibly exist? If so, I maintain
(whether I do or do not grant free will), that such an one, if he sees
that he can live more conveniently on the gallows than sitting at his
own table, would act most foolishly, if he did not hang himself. So
anyone who clearly saw that, by committing crimes, he would enjoy a
really more perfect and better life and existence, than he could attain
by the practice of virtue, would be foolish if he did not act on his
convictions. For, with such a perverse human nature as his, crime would
become virtue.

As to the other question, which you add in your postscript, seeing that
one might ask a hundred such in an hour, without arriving at a
conclusion about any, and seeing that you yourself do not press for an
answer, I will send none.

I will now only subscribe myself, &c.
