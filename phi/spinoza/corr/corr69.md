### LETTER LXIX. (LXXX.)

#### \* \* \* \* \* <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_77.md) TO SPINOZA.

\[*The writer asks for explanations of some passages in the letter about
the infinite* (XXIX.).\]

<span class="smallcaps">Distinguished Sir</span>,—In the first place I
can with great difficulty conceive, how it can be proved, et priori,
that bodies exist having motion and figure, seeing that, in extension
considered absolutely in itself, nothing of the kind is met with.
Secondly, I should like to learn from you, how this passage in your
letter on the infinite is to be understood:—"*They do not hence infer
that such things elude number by the multitude of their component
parts*." For, as a matter of fact, all mathematicians seem to me always
to demonstrate, with regard to such infinities, that the number of the
parts is so great, as to elude all expression in terms of number. And in
the example you give of the two circles, you do not appear to prove this
statement, <span id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_78.md) which was yet what you
had undertaken to do. For in this second passage you only show, that
they do not draw this conclusion from "*the excessive size of the
intervening* 

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

*space*," or from the fact that "*we do not know the maximum and the
minimum of the said space;*" but you do not demonstrate, as you
intended, that the conclusion is not based on the multitude of parts,
&e.

2 May, 1676.
