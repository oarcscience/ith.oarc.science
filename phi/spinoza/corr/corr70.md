### LETTER LXX. (LXXXI.)

#### SPINOZA TO \* \* \* \* \* <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_79.md)

\[*Spinoza explains his view of the infinite*.\]

<span class="smallcaps">Distinguished Sir</span>,—My statement
concerning the infinite, that an infinity of parts cannot be inferred
from a multitude of parts, is plain when we consider that, if such a
conclusion could be drawn from a multitude of parts, we should not be
able to imagine a greater multitude of parts; the first-named multitude,
whatever it was, would have to be the greater, which is contrary to
fact. For in the whole space between two non-concentric circles we
conceive a greater multitude of parts than in half that space, yet the
number of parts in the half, as in the whole of the space, exceeds any
assignable number. Again, from extension, as Descartes conceives it, to
wit, a quiescent mass, it is not only difficult, as you say, but
absolutely impossible to prove the existence of bodies. For matter at
rest, as it is in itself, will continue at rest, and will only be
determined to motion by some more powerful external cause; for this
reason I have not hesitated on a former occasion to affirm, that the
Cartesian principles of natural things are useless, not to say absurd.

The Hague, 5 May, 1676.
