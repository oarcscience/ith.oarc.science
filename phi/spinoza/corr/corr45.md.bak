### LETTER XLVII. (XLIV.)

#### SPINOZA TO I. I.

\[*Spinoza begs his friend to stop the printing of the Dutch version of
the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus. Some remarks on a pernicious
pamphlet*, "*Homo Politicus*," *and on Thales of Miletus*.\]

<span class="smallcaps">Most courteous Sir</span>,—When Professor N. N.
visited me the other day, he told me that my Theologico-Political
Treatise has been translated into Dutch, and that someone, whose name he
did not know, was about printing it. With regard to this, I earnestly
beg you to inquire carefully into the business, and, if possible, stop
the printing. This is the

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

request not only of myself, but of many of my friends and acquaintances,
who would be sorry to see the book placed under an interdict, as it
undoubtedly would be, if published in Dutch. I do not doubt, but that
you will do this service to me and the cause.

One of my friends sent me a short time since a pamphlet called "Homo
Politicus," of which I had heard much. I have read it, and find it to be
the most pernicious work which men could devise or invent. Rank and
riches are the author's highest good; he adapts his doctrine
accordingly, and shows the means to acquire them; to wit, by inwardly
rejecting all religion, and outwardly professing whatever best serves
his own advancement, also by keeping faith with no one, except in so far
as he himself is profited thereby. For the rest, to feign, to make
promises and break them,, to lie, to swear falsely, and many such like
practices call forth his highest praises. When I had finished reading
the book, I debated whether I should write a pamphlet indirectly aimed
against its author, wherein I should treat of the highest good and show
the troubled and wretched condition of those who are covetous of rank
and riches; finally proving by very plain reasoning and many examples,
that the insatiable desire for rank and riches must bring and has
brought ruin to states.

How much better and more excellent than the doctrines of the aforesaid
writer are the reflections of Thales of Miletus, appears from the
following. All the goods of friends, he says, are in common; wise men
are the friends of the gods, and all things belong to the gods;
therefore all things belong to the wise. Thus in a single sentence, this
wisest of men accounts himself most rich, rather by nobly despising
riches than by sordidly seeking them. In other passages he shows that
the wise lack riches, not from necessity, but from choice. For when his
friends reproached him with his poverty he answered, "Do you wish me to
show you, that I could acquire what I deem unworthy of my labour, but
you so diligently seek?" On their answering in the affirmative, he hired
every oil-press in the whole of Greece (for being a distinguished
astrologer he knew that the olive harvest would be as abundant as in
previous years it had been scanty), and sub-let at his own

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

price what he had hired for a very small sum, thus acquiring in a single
year a large fortune, which he bestowed liberally as he had gained it
industriously, &c.

The Hague, 17 Feb., 1671.
