### LETTER XIX. (LXVIII.)

#### SPINOZA TO OLDENBURG.

\[*Spinoza relates his journey to Amsterdam for the purpose of
publishing his Ethics; he was deterred by the dissuasions of theologians
and Cartesians. He hopes that Oldenburg will inform him of some of the
objections to the Tractatus Theologico-Politicos, made by learned men,
so that they may be answered in notes*.\]

<span class="smallcaps">Distinguished and Illustrious Sir</span>,—When I
received your letter of the 22nd July, I had set out to Amsterdam for
the purpose of publishing the book I had mentioned to you. While I was
negotiating, a rumour gained currency that I had in the press a book
concerning God, wherein I endeavoured to show that there is no God. This
report was believed by many. Hence certain theologians, perhaps the
authors of the rumour, took occasion to complain of me before the prince
and the magistrates; moreover, the stupid Cartesians, being suspected of
favouring me, endeavoured to remove the aspersion by abusing everywhere
my opinions and writings, a course which they still pursue. When I
became aware of this through trustworthy men, who also assured me that
the theologians were everywhere lying in wait for me, I determined to
put off publishing till I saw how things were going, and I proposed to
inform you of my intentions. But matters seem to get worse and worse,
and I am still uncertain what to do.

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Meanwhile I do not
like to delay any longer answering your letter. I will first thank you
heartily for your friendly warning, which I should be glad to have
further explained, so that I may know, which are the doctrines which
seem to you to be aimed against the practice of religion and virtue. If
principles agree with reason, they are, I take it, also most serviceable
to virtue. Further, if it be not troubling you too much I beg you to
point out the passages in the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus which are
objected to by the learned, for I want to illustrate that treatise with
notes, and to remove if possible the prejudices conceived against it.
Farewell.
