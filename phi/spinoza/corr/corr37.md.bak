### LETTER XXXVIII. (XXVII.)

#### SPINOZA TO BLYENBERGH.

\[*Spinoza declines further correspondence with Blyenbergh, but says he
will give explanations of certain points by word of mouth*. (*Voorburg*,
3*rd* *June*, 1665)\] <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)

<span class="smallcaps">Friend and Sir</span>,—When your letter, dated
27th March, was delivered to me, I was just starting for Amsterdam. I,
therefore, after reading half of it, left it at home, to be answered on
my return: for I thought it dealt only with questions raised in our
first controversy. However, a second perusal showed me, that it embraced
a far wider subject, and not only asked me for a proof of what, in my
preface to "Principles of Cartesian Philosophy," I wrote (with the
object of merely stating, without proving or urging my opinion), but
also requested me to impart a great portion of my Ethics, which, as
everyone knows, ought to be based on physics and metaphysics. For this
reason, I have been unable to allow myself to satisfy your demands. I
wished to await an opportunity for begging you, in a most friendly way,
by word of mouth, to withdraw your request, for giving you my reasons
for refusal, and for showing that your inquiries do not promote the

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

solution of our first controversy, but, on the contrary, are for the
most part entirely dependent on its previous settlement. So far are they
not essential to the understanding of my doctrine concerning necessity,
that they cannot be apprehended, unless the latter question is
understood first. However, before such an opportunity offered, a second
letter reached me this week, appearing to convey a certain sense of
displeasure at my delay. Necessity, therefore, has compelled me to write
you these few words, to acquaint you more fully with my proposal and
decision. I hope that, when the facts of the case are before you, you
will, of your own accord, desist from your request, and will still
remain kindly disposed towards me. I, for my part, will, in all things,
according to my power, prove myself your, &c.
