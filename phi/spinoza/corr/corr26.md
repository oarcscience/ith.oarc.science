### LETTER XXVIII. (X.)

#### SPINOZA TO SIMON DE VRIES.

\[*Spinoza, in answer to a letter from De Vries now lost, speaks of the
experience necessary for proving a definition, and also of eternal
truths*.\]

<span class="smallcaps">Respected Friend</span>,—You ask me if we have
need of experience, in order to know whether the definition of a given
attribute is true. To this I answer, that we never need experience,
except in cases when the existence of the thing cannot be inferred from
its definition, as, for instance, the existence of modes (which cannot
be inferred from their definition); experience is not needed, when the
existence of the things in question is not distinguished from their
essence, and is therefore inferred from their definition. This can never
be taught us by any experience, for experience does not teach us any
essences of things; the utmost it can do is to set our mind thinking
about definite essences only. Wherefore, when the existence of
attributes

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

does not differ from their essence, no experience is capable of
attaining it for us.

To your further question, whether things and their modifications are
eternal truths, I answer: Certainly. If you ask me, why I do not call
them eternal truths, I answer, in order to distinguish them, in
accordance with general usage, from those propositions, which do not
make manifest any particular thing or modification of a thing; for
example, nothing comes from nothing. These and such like propositions
are, I repeat, called eternal truths simply, the meaning merely being,
that they have no standpoint external to the mind, &c.
