### LETTER LXXV. (LXIX.)

### SPINOZA TO LAMBERT VAN VELTHUYSEN (*Doctor of Medicine at Utrecht*.) <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_87.md)

\[*Of the proposed annotation of the* "*Tractatus
Theologico-Politicus*."\]

<span class="smallcaps">Most excellent and distinguished Sir</span>,—I
wonder at our friend Neustadt having said, that I am meditating the
refutation of the various writings circulated against my

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

book, <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_88.md) and that among the works for
me to refute he places your MS. For I certainly have never entertained
the intention of refuting any of my adversaries: they all seem to me
utterly unworthy of being answered. I do not remember to have said to
Mr. Neustadt anything more, than that I proposed to illustrate some of
the obscurer passages in the treatise with notes, and that I should add
to these your MS., and my answer, if your consent could be gained, on
which last point I begged him to speak to you, adding, that if you
refused permission on the ground, that some of the observations in my
answer were too harshly put, you should be given full power to modify or
expunge them. In the meanwhile, I am by no means angry with Mr.
Neustadt, but I wanted to put the matter before you as it stands, that
if your permission be not granted, I might show you that I have no wish
to publish your MS. against your will. Though I think it might be issued
without endangering your reputation, if it appears without your name, I
will take no steps in the matter, unless you give me leave. But, to tell
the truth, you would do me a far greater kindness, if you would put in
writing the arguments with which you think you can impugn my treatise,
and add them to your MS. I most earnestly beg you to do this. For there
is no one whose arguments I would more willingly consider; knowing, as I
do, that you are bound solely by your zeal for truth, and that your mind
is singularly candid, I therefore beg you again and again, not to shrink
from undertaking this task, and to believe me, Yours most obediently,

<span class="smallcaps">b. de Spinoza</span>.
