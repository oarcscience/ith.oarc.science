### LETTER XXV. (LXXVIII.)

##### Written 7 Feb., 1676.

#### SPINOZA TO OLDENBURG.

\[*Spinoza again treats of fatalism. He repeats that he accepts Christ's
passion, death, and burial literally, but His resurrection
spiritually*.\]

<span class="smallcaps">Distinguished Sir</span>,—When I said in my
former letter that we are inexcusable, because we are in the power of
God, like clay in the hands of the potter, I meant to be understood in
the sense, that no one can bring a complaint against God for having
given him a weak nature, or infirm spirit. A circle might as well
complain to God of not being endowed with the properties of a sphere, or
a child who is tortured, say, with stone, for not being given a healthy
body, as a man of feeble spirit, because God has

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

denied to him fortitude, and the true knowledge and love of the Deity,
or because he is endowed with so weak a nature, that he cannot check or
moderate his desires. For the nature of each thing is only competent to
do that which follows necessarily from its given cause. That every man
cannot be brave, and that we can no more command for ourselves a healthy
body than a healthy mind, nobody can deny, without giving the lie to
experience, as well as to reason. "But," you urge, "if men sin by
nature, they are excusable;" but you do not state the conclusion you
draw, whether that God cannot be angry with them, or that they are
worthy of blessedness—that is, of the knowledge and love of God. If you
say the former, I fully admit that God cannot be angry, and that all
things are done in accordance with His will; but I deny that all men
ought, therefore, to be blessed—men may be excusable, and, nevertheless,
be without blessedness and afflicted in many ways. A horse is excusable,
for being a horse and not a man; but, nevertheless, he must needs be a
horse and not a man. He who goes mad from the bite of a dog is
excusable, yet he is rightly suffocated. Lastly, he who cannot govern
his desires, and keep them in check with the fear of the laws, though
his weakness may be excusable, yet he cannot enjoy with contentment the
knowledge and love of God, but necessarily perishes. I do not think it
necessary here to remind you, that Scripture, when it says that God is
angry with sinners, and that He is a Judge who takes cognizance of human
actions, passes sentence on them, and judges them, is speaking humanly,
and in a way adapted to the received opinion of the masses, inasmuch as
its purpose is not to teach philosophy, nor to render men wise, but to
make them obedient.

How, by taking miracles and ignorance as equivalent terms, I reduce
God's power and man's knowledge within the same limits, I am unable to
discern.

For the rest, I accept Christ's passion, death, and burial literally, as
you do, but His resurrection I understand allegorically. I admit, that
it is related by the Evangelists in such detail, that we cannot deny
that they themselves believed Christ's body to have risen from the dead
and ascended to heaven, in order to sit at the right hand of

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> God, or that they
believed that Christ might have been seen by unbelievers, if they had
happened to be at hand, in the places where He appeared to His
disciples; but in these matters they might, without injury to Gospel
teaching, have been deceived, as was the case with other prophets
mentioned in my last letter. But Paul, to whom Christ afterwards
appeared, rejoices, that he knew Christ not after the flesh, but after
the spirit. <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) Farewell, honourable
Sir, and believe me yours in all affection and zeal.
