### LETTER XX. (LXXI.)

#### OLDENBURG TO SPINOZA.

As I see from your last letter, the book you propose to publish is in
peril. It is impossible not to approve your purpose of illustrating and
softening down those passages in the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus,
which have given pain to its readers. First I would call attention to
the ambiguities in your treatment of God and Nature: a great many people
think you have confused the one with the other. Again, you seem to many
to take away the authority and value of miracles, whereby alone, as
nearly all Christians believe, the certainty of the divine revelation
can be established.

Again, people say that you conceal your opinion concerning Jesus Christ,
the Redeemer of the world, the only Mediator for mankind, and concerning
His incarnation and redemption: they would like you to give a clear
explanation of what you think on these three subjects. If you do this
and thus give satisfaction to prudent and rational Christians, I think
your affairs are safe. Farewell.

London, 15 Nov., 1675.

P.S.—Send me a line, I beg, to inform me whether this note has reached
you safely.
