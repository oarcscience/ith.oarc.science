### LETTER XLI. (XXXVI.)

#### SPINOZA TO CHRISTIAN HUYGHENS.

\[*Further discussion concerning the unity of God. Spinoza asks for
advice about polishing lenses*. (*Voorburg*, *May*, 1666.)\]

<span class="smallcaps">Distinguished Sir</span>,—I have been by one
means or another prevented from answering sooner your letter, dated 19th
May. As I gather that you suspend your judgment with regard to most of
the demonstration I sent you (owing, I believe, to the obscurity you
find in it), I will here endeavour to explain its meaning more clearly.

First I enumerated four properties, which a Being existing by its own
sufficiency or force must possess. These four, and others like them, I
reduced in my fifth observation to one. Further, in order to deduce all
things necessary for the demonstration from a single premiss, I
endeavoured in my sixth observation to demonstrate the existence of God
from the given hypothesis; whence, lastly, taking (as you know) nothing
beyond the ordinary meaning of the terms, I drew the desired conclusion.

Such, in brief, was my purpose and such my aim. I will now explain the
meaning of each step singly, and will first start with the aforesaid
four properties.

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

In the first you find no difficulty, nor is it anything but, as in the
case of the second, an axiom. By simple I merely mean not compound, or
not made up of parts differing in nature or other parts agreeing in
nature. This demonstration is assuredly universal.

The sense of my third observation (that if the Being be thought, it
cannot be conceived as limited by thought, but only as infinite, and
similarly, if it be extension, it cannot be conceived as limited by
extension) you have excellently perceived, though you say you do not
perceive the conclusion; this last is based on the fact, that a
contradiction is involved in conceiving under the category of
non-existence anything, whose definition includes or (what is the same
thing) affirms existence. And since determination implies nothing
positive, but only a limitation of the existence of the nature conceived
as determinate, it follows that that, of which the definition affirms
existence, cannot be conceived as determinate. For instance, if the term
extension included necessary existence, it would be alike impossible to
conceive extension without existence and existence without extension. If
this were established, it would be impossible to conceive determinate
extension. For, if it be conceived as determinate, it must be determined
by its own nature, that is by extension, and this extension, whereby it
is determined, must be conceived under the category of non-existence,
which by the hypothesis is obviously a contradiction. In my fourth
observation, I merely wished to show, that such a Being could neither be
divided into parts of the same nature or parts of a different nature,
whether those of a different nature involved necessary existence or not.
If, I said, we adopt the second view, the Being would be destroyed; for
destruction is merely the resolution of a thing into parts so that none
of them expresses the nature of the whole; if we adopt the first view,
we should be in contradiction with the first three properties.

In my fifth observation, I merely asserted, that perfection consists in
being, and imperfection in the privation of being. I say the privation;
for although extension denies of itself thought, this argues no
imperfection in it. It would be an imperfection in it, if it were in any
degree

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

deprived of extension, as it would be, if it were determinate; or again,
if it lacked duration, position, &c.

My sixth observation you accept absolutely, and yet you say, that your
whole difficulty remains (inasmuch as there may be, you think, several
self-existent entities of different nature; as for instance thought and
extension are different and perhaps subsist by their own sufficiency). I
am, therefore, forced to believe, that you attribute to my observation a
meaning quite different from the one intended by me. I think I can
discern your interpretation of it; however, in order to save time, I
will merely set forth my own meaning. I say then, as regards my sixth
observation, that if we assert that anything, which is indeterminate and
perfect only after its kind, exists by its own sufficiency, we must also
grant the existence of a Being indeterminate and perfect absolutely;
such a Being I will call God. If, for example, we wish to assert that
extension or thought (which are each perfect after their kind, that is,
in a given sphere of being) exists by its own sufficiency, we must grant
also the existence of God, who is absolutely perfect, that is of a Being
absolutely indeterminate. I would here direct attention to what I have
just said with regard to the term *imperfection;* namely, that it
signifies that a thing is deficient in some quality, which,
nevertheless, belongs to its nature. For instance, extension can only be
called imperfect in respect of duration, position, or quantity: that is,
as not enduring longer, as not retaining its position, or as not being
greater. It can never be called imperfect, because it does not think,
inasmuch as its nature requires nothing of the kind, but consists solely
in extension, that is in a certain sphere of being. Only in respect to
its own sphere can it be called determinate or indeterminate, perfect or
imperfect. Now, since the nature of God is not confined to a certain
sphere of being, but exists in being, which is absolutely indeterminate,
so His nature also demands everything which perfectly expresses being;
otherwise His nature would be determinate and deficient.

This being so, it follows that there can be only one Being, namely God,
who exists by His own force. If, for the sake of an illustration, we
assert, that extension involves existence; it is, therefore, necessary
that it should

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

be eternal and indeterminate, and express absolutely no imperfection,
but perfection. Hence extension will appertain to God, or will be
something which in some fashion expresses the nature of God, since God
is a Being, who not only in a certain respect but absolutely is in
essence indeterminate and omnipotent. What we have here said oy way of
illustration regarding extension must be asserted of all that we ascribe
a similar existence to. I, therefore, conclude as in my former letter,
that there is nothing external to God, but that God alone exists by His
own sufficiency. I think I have said enough to show the meaning of my
former letter; however, of this you will be the best judge. \* \* \* \*

(*The rest of the letter is occupied with details about the polishing of
lenses*.)
