### LETTER LXVII. (LXV.)

#### \* \* \* \* \* <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_70.md) TO SPINOZA.

\[*A fresh inquiry as to whether there are two or more attributes of
God*.\]

<span class="smallcaps">Distinguished Sir</span>,—I should like a
demonstration of what you say: namely, that the soul cannot perceive any
attributes of God, except extension and thought. Though this might
appear evident to me, it seems possible that the contrary might be
deduced from Ethics II. vii. note; perhaps because I do not rightly
grasp the meaning of that passage. I have therefore resolved,
distinguished Sir, to show you how I make the deduction, earnestly
begging you to aid me with your usual courtesy, wherever I do not
rightly represent your meaning. I reason as follows:—Though I gather
that the universe is one, it is not less clear from the passage referred
to, that it is expressed in infinite modes, and therefore that every
individual thing is expressed in infinite modes. Hence it seems to
follow, that the modification constituting my mind, and the modification
constituting my body, though one and the same modification, is yet
expressed in infinite ways—first, through thought; secondly, through
extension; thirdly, through some attribute of God unknown to me, and so
on to infinity, seeing that there are in God infinite attributes, and
the order and connection of the modifications seem to

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

be the same in all. Hence arises the question: Why the mind, which
represents a certain modification, the same modification being expressed
not only in extension, but in infinite other ways,—why, I repeat, does
the mind perceive that modification only as expressed through extension,
to wit, the human body, and not as expressed through any other
attributes? Time does not allow me to pursue the subject further;
perhaps my difficulties will be removed by further reflection.

London, 12 Aug., 1675.
