### LETTER XXXIII. (XX.)

#### BLYENBERGH TO SPINOZA.

(*A summary only of this letter is here given*.—<span
class="smallcaps">Tr</span>.)

I have two rules in my philosophic inquiries: i. Conformity to reason;
ii. Conformity to scripture. I consider the second the most important.
Examining your letter by the first, I observe that your identification
of God's creative power with His preservative power seems to involve,
either that evil does not exist, or else that God brings about evil. If
evil be only a term relative to our imperfect knowledge, how do you
explain the state of a man who falls from a state of grace into sin? If
evil be a negation, how can we have the power to sin? If God causes an
evil act, he must cause the evil as well as the act. You say that every
man can only act, as he, in fact, does act. This removes all distinction
between the good and the wicked. Both, according to you, are perfect.
You remove all the sanctions of virtue and reduce us to automata. Your
doctrine, that strictly speaking we cannot sin against God, is a hard
saying.

\[The rest of the letter is taken up with an examination of Spinoza's
arguments in respect to their conformity to Scripture.\]

Dordrecht, 16 Jan., 1665.
