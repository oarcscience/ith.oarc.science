### LETTER IX. (XIII.)

#### SPINOZA TO OLDENBURG.

\[*Spinoza informs Oldenburg that he has removed to Rhijnsburg, and has
spent some time at Amsterdam for the purpose of publishing the
"Principles of Cartesian Philosophy." He then replies to Boyle's
objections*.\]

DISTINGUISHED SIR,—I have at length received your long wished for
letter, and am at liberty to answer it. But, before I do so, I will
briefly tell you, what has prevented my replying before. When I removed
my household goods here in April, I set out for Amsterdam. While there
certain friends asked me to impart to them a treatise containing, in
brief, the second part of the principles of Descartes treated
geometrically, together with some of the chief points treated of in
metaphysics, which I had formerly dictated to a youth, to whom I did not
wish to teach my own opinions openly. They further requested me, at the
first opportunity, to compose a similar treatise on the first part.
Wishing to oblige my friends, I at once set myself to the

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

task, which I finished in a fortnight, and handed over to them. They
then asked for leave to print it, which I readily granted on the
condition that one of them should, under my supervision, clothe it in
more elegant phraseology, and add a little preface warning readers that
I do not acknowledge all the opinions there set forth as my own,
inasmuch as I hold the exact contrary to much that is there written,
illustrating the fact by one or two examples. All this the friend who
took charge of the treatise promised to do, and this is the cause for my
prolonged stay in Amsterdam. Since I returned to this village, I have
hardly been able to call my time my own, because of the friends who have
been kind enough to visit me. At last, my dear friend, a moment has
come, when I can relate these occurrences to you, and inform you why I
allow this treatise to see the light. It may be that on this occasion
some of those, who hold the foremost positions in my country, will be
found desirous of seeing the rest of my writings, which I acknowledge as
my own; they will thus take care that I am enabled to publish them
without any danger of infringing the laws of the land. If this be as I
think, I shall doubtless publish at once; if things fall out otherwise,
I would rather be silent than obtrude my opinions on men, in defiance of
my country, and thus render them hostile to me. I therefore hope, my
friend, that you will not chafe at having to wait a short time longer;
you shall then receive from me either the treatise printed, or the
summary of it which you ask for. If meanwhile you would like to have one
or two copies of the work now in the press,

I will satisfy your wish, as soon as I know of it and of means to send
the book conveniently.

\[*The rest of the letter is taken up with criticisms on Boyle's
book*.\]
