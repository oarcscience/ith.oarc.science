### LETTER XXXV. (XXII.)

#### BLYENBERGH TO SPINOZA.

\[*This letter* (*extending over five pages*) *is only given here in
brief summary*.\]

The tone of your last letter is very different from that of your first.
If our essence is equivalent to our state at a given time, we are as
perfect when sinning as when virtuous: God would wish for vice as much
as virtue. Both the virtuous and the vicious execute God's will—What is
the difference between them? You say some actions are more perfect than
others; wherein does this perfection consist? If a mind existed so
framed, that vice was in agreement with its proper nature, why should
such a mind prefer good to evil? If God makes us all that we are, how
can we "go astray"? Can rational substances depend on God in any way
except lifelessly? What is the difference between a rational being's
dependence on God, and an irrational being's? If we have no free will,
are not our actions God's actions, and our will God's will? I could ask
several more questions, but do not venture.

P.S. In my hurry I forgot to insert this question: Whether we cannot by
foresight avert what would otherwise happen to us?

Dordrecht, 19 Feb., 1665.
