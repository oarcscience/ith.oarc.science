### LETTER LIII. (XLVII.)

#### FABRITIUS TO SPINOZA.

\[*Fabritius, under the order and in the name of the .Elector Palatine,
offers Spinoza the post of Professor of Philosophy at Heidelberg, under
very liberal conditions*.\]

<span class="smallcaps">Most renowned Sir</span>,—His Most Serene
Highness the Elector Palatine, <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_60) my
most gracious master, commands me to write to you, who are, as yet,
unknown to me, but most favourably regarded by his Most Serene Highness,
and to inquire of you, whether you are willing to accept an ordinary
professorship of Philosophy in his illustrious university. An annual
salary would be paid to you, equal to that enjoyed at present by the
ordinary professors. You will hardly find elsewhere a prince more
favourable to distinguished talents, among which he reckons yourself.
You will have the most ample freedom in philosophical teaching, which
the prince is confident you will not misuse, to disturb the religion
publicly established. I cannot refrain from seconding the prince's
injunction. I therefore most

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

earnestly beg you to reply as soon as possible, and to address your
answer either under cover to the Most Serene Elector's resident at the
Hague, Mr. Grotius, or to Mr. Gilles Van der Hele, so that it may come
in the packet of letters usually sent to the court, or else to avail
yourself of some other convenient opportunity for transmitting it. I
will only add, that if you come here, you will live pleasantly a life
worthy of a philosopher, unless events turn out quite contrary to our
expectation and hope. So farewell.

I remain, illustrious Sir,         
Your devoted admirer,      
I. LEWIS FABRITIUS.

Professor of the Academy of Heidelberg, and Councillor of the Elector
Palatine.

Heidelberg, 16 Feb., 1673.
