### LETTER LII. (XLVI.)

#### SPINOZA TO LEIBNITZ.

\[*Answer to the foregoing letter*\].

<span class="smallcaps">Most learned and distinguished Sir</span>,—I
have read the paper you were kind enough to send me, and return you many
thanks for the communication. I regret that I

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

have not been able quite to follow your meaning, though you explain it
sufficiently clearly, whether you think that there is any cause for
making the apertures of the glasses small, except that the rays coming
from a single point are not collected accurately at another single
point, but in a small area which we generally call the mechanical point,
and that this small area is greater or less in proportion to the size of
the aperture. Further, I ask whether the lenses which you call
"pandochæ" correct this fault, so that the mechanical point or small
area, on which the rays coming from a single point are after refraction
collected, always preserves the same proportional size, whether the
aperture be small or large. If so, one may enlarge the aperture as much
as one likes, and consequently these lenses will be far superior to
those of any other shape known to me; if not, I hardly see why you
praise them so greatly beyond common lenses. For circular lenses have
everywhere the same axis; therefore, when we employ them, we must regard
all the points of an object as placed in the optic axis; although all
the points of the object be not at the same distance, the difference
arising thence will not be perceptible, when the objects are very
remote; because then the rays coming from a single point would, as they
enter the glass, be regarded as parallel. I think your lenses might be
of service in obtaining a more distinct representation of all the
objects, when we wish to include several objects in one view, as we do,
when we employ very large convex circular lenses. However, I would
rather suspend my judgment about all these details, till you have more
clearly explained your meaning, as I heartily beg you to do. I have, as
you requested, sent the other copy of your paper to Mr. \* \* \* \*. He
answers, that he has at present no time to study it, but he hopes to
have leisure in a week or two.

I have not yet seen the "Prodromo" of Francis Lana, nor the
"Physico-Mechanical Reflections" of John Oltius. What I more regret is,
that your "Physical Hypothesis" has not yet come to my hands, nor is
there a copy for sale here at the Hague. The gift, therefore, which you
so liberally promise me will be most acceptable to me; if I can be of
use to you in any other matter, you will always

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

find me most ready. I hope you will not think it too irksome to reply to
this short note.

Distinguished Sir,         
Yours sincerely,      
B. DE SPINOZA.

The Hague, 9 Nov., 1671.

P.S. Mr. Diemerbroech does not live here. I am, therefore, forced to
entrust this to an ordinary letter-carrier. I doubt not that you know
someone at the Hague, who would take charge of our letters; I should
like to hear of such a person, that our correspondence might be more
conveniently and securely taken care of. If the "Tractatus
Theologico-Politicus" has not yet come to your hands, I will, unless you
have any objection, send you a copy. Farewell.
