### LETTER XVI. (XXXIII)

#### OLDENBURG TO SPINOZA.

\[*After some remarks on Spinoza's last letter, and an account of
experiments at the Royal Society and at Oxford, Oldenburg mentions ca
report about the return of the Jews to Palestine*\].

\*     \*     \*     \*     \*     \*

But I pass on to politics. Everyone here is talking of a report that the
Jews, after remaining scattered for more than two thousand years, are
about to return to their country. Few here believe in it, but many
desire it. Please tell your friend what you hear and think on the
matter. For my part, unless the news is confirmed from trustworthy
sources at Constantinople, which is the place chiefly concerned, I shall
not believe it. I should like to know, what the Jews of Amsterdam have
heard about the matter, and how they are affected by such important

tidings which, if true, would assuredly seem to harbinger the end of the
world. \* \* \* Believe me to be

Yours most zealously,  
HENRY OLDENBURG

London, 8 Dec., 1665.

P.S. I will shortly (<span class="smallcaps">D.V.</span>) tell you the
opinion of our philosophers on the recent comets.
