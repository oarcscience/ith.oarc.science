### LETTER LI. (XLV.)

#### GODFREY LEIBNITZ TO SPINOZA.

<span class="smallcaps">Distinguished Sir</span>,—Among your other
merits spread abroad by fame, I understand that you have remarkable
skill in optics. I have, therefore, wished to forward my essay, such as
it is, to you, as I am not likely to find a better critic in this branch
of learning. The paper, which I send you, and which I have styled "a
note on advanced optics," has been published with the view of more
conveniently making known my ideas to my friends and the curious in such
matters. I hear that \* \* \* \* \* is very clever in the same subject,
doubtless he is well known to you. <span id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_58.md)
If you could obtain for me his opinion and kind

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

attention, you would greatly increase my obligation to you. The paper
explains itself.

I believe you have already received the "Prodromo" of Francis Lana <span
id="fr_60"></span>[1](corr50.htm#fn_59.md) the Jesuit, written in Italian.
Some remarkable observations on optics are contained in it. John Oltius
too, a young Swiss very learned in these matters, has published
"Physico-Mechanical Reflections concerning Vision;" in which he
announces a machine for the polishing all kinds of glasses, very simple
and of universal applicability, and also declares that he has discovered
a means of collecting all the rays coming from different points of an
object, so as to obtain an equal number of corresponding points, but
only under conditions of a given distance and form of object. My
proposal is, not that the rays from all points should be collected and
re-arranged (this is with any object of distance impossible at the
present stage of our knowledge); the result I aim at is the equal
collection of rays from points outside the optic axis and in the optic
axis, so that the apertures of glasses could be made of any size desired
without impairing the distinctness of vision. But this must stand
according to your skilled verdict. Farewell, and believe me,
distinguished Sir, your obedient servant,

<span class="smallcaps">Godfrey Leibnitz,</span>

J. U. D., Councillor of the Elector of Mainz.

Frankfort, 5 Oct., 1671 (new style).
