*On the Improvement of Understanding*, by Benedict de Spinoza, \[1883\],
at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE UNDERSTANDING

\[1\] (1) After experience had taught me that all the usual surroundings
of social life are vain and futile; seeing that none of the objects of
my fears contained in themselves anything either good or bad, except in
so far as the mind is affected by them, I finally resolved to inquire
whether there might be some real good having power to communicate
itself, which would affect the mind singly, to the exclusion of all
else: whether, in fact, there might be anything of which the discovery
and attainment would enable me to enjoy continuous, supreme, and
unending happiness.

\[2\] (1) I say "I finally resolved," for at first sight it seemed
unwise willingly to lose hold on what was sure for the sake of something
then uncertain. (2) I could see the benefits which are acquired through
fame and riches, and that I should be obliged to abandon the quest of
such objects, if I seriously devoted myself to the search for something
different and new. (3) I perceived that if true happiness chanced to be
placed in the former I should necessarily miss it; while if, on the
other hand, it were not so placed, and I gave them my whole attention, I
should equally fail.
