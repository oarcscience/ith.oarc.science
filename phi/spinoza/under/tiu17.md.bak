### ITS MEANS, GOOD DEFINITIONS—CONDITIONS OF DEFINITION

\[94\] (1) Thus the true method of discovery is to form thoughts from
some given definition. (2) This process will be the more fruitful and
easy in proportion as the thing given be better defined. (3) Wherefore,
the cardinal point of all this second part of method consists in the
knowledge of the conditions of good definition, and the means of finding
them. (4) I will first treat of the conditions of definition.

\[95\] (1) A definition, if it is to be called perfect, must explain the
inmost essence of a thing, and must take care not to substitute for this
any of its properties. (2) In order to illustrate my meaning, without
taking an example which would seem to show a desire to expose other
people's errors, I will choose the case of something abstract, the
definition of which is of little moment. (95:3) Such is a circle. (4) If
a circle be defined as a figure, such that all straight lines drawn from
the center to the circumference are equal, every one can see that such a
definition does not in the least explain the essence of a circle, but
solely one of its properties. (5) Though, as I have said, this is of no
importance in the case of figures and other abstractions, it is of great
importance in the case of physical beings and realities: for the
properties of things are not understood so long as their essences are
unknown. (6) If the latter be passed over, there is necessarily a
perversion of the succession of ideas which should reflect the
succession of nature, and we go far astray from our object.

\[96\] In order to be free from this fault, the following rules should
be observed in definition:—I. (1) If the thing in question be created,
the definition must (as we have said) comprehend the proximate cause.
(2) For instance, a circle should, according to this rule, be defined as
follows: the figure described by any line whereof one end is fixed and
the other free. (3) This definition clearly comprehends the proximate
cause.

II\. (4) A conception or definition of a thing should be such that all
the properties of that thing, in so far as it is considered by itself,
and not in conjunction with other things, can be deduced from it, as may
be seen in the definition given of a circle: for from that it clearly
follows that all straight lines drawn from the center to the
circumference are equal. (5) That this is a necessary characteristic of
a definition is so clear to anyone, who reflects on the matter, that
there is no need to spend time in proving it, or in showing that, owing
to this second condition, every definition should be affirmative. (6) I
speak of intellectual affirmation, giving little thought to verbal
affirmations which, owing to the poverty of language, must sometimes,
perhaps, be expressed negatively, though the idea contained is
affirmative.

\[97\] The rules for the definition of an uncreated thing are as
follows:—I. The exclusion of all idea of cause—that is, the thing must
not need explanation by Anything outside itself.

II\. When the definition of the thing has been given, there must be no
room for doubt as to whether the thing exists or not.

III\. It must contain, as far as the mind is concerned, no substantives
which could be put into an adjectival form; in other words, the object
defined must not be explained through abstractions.

IV\. Lastly, though this is not absolutely necessary, it should be
possible to deduce from the definition all the properties of the thing
defined.

All these rules become obvious to anyone giving strict attention to the
matter.

\[98\] (1) I have also stated that the best basis for drawing a
conclusion is a particular affirmative essence. (2) The more specialized
the idea is, the more it is distinct, and therefore clear. (3) Wherefore
a knowledge of particular things should be sought for as diligently as
possible.

\[99\] (1) As regards the order of our perceptions, and the manner in
which they should be arranged and united, it is necessary that, as soon
as is possible and rational, we should inquire whether there be any
being (and, if so, what being), that is the cause of all things, so that
its essence, represented in thought, may be the cause of all our ideas,
and then our mind will to the utmost possible extent reflect nature. (2)
For it will possess, subjectively, nature's essence, order, and union.
(3) Thus we can see that it is before all things necessary for us to
deduce all our ideas from physical things—that is, from real entities,
proceeding, as far as may be, according to the series of causes, from
one real entity to another real entity, never passing to universals and
abstractions, either for the purpose of deducing some real entity from
them, or deducing them from some real entity. (4) Either of these
processes interrupts the true progress of the understanding.

\[100\] (1) But it must be observed that, by the series of causes and
real entities, I do not here mean the series of particular and mutable
things, but only the series of fixed and eternal things. (2) It would be
impossible for human infirmity to follow up the series of particular
mutable things, both on account their multitude, surpassing all
calculation, and on account of the infinitely diverse circumstances
surrounding one and the same thing, any one of which may be the cause of
its existence or non-existence. (3) Indeed, their existence has no
connection with their essence, or (as we have said already) is not an
eternal truth.

\[101\] (1) Neither is there any need that we should understand their
series, for the essences of particular mutable things are not to be
gathered from their series or order of existence, which would furnish us
with nothing beyond their extrinsic denominations, their relations, or,
at most, their circumstances, all of which are very different from their
inmost essence. (101:2) This inmost essence must be sought solely from
fixed and eternal things, and from the laws, inscribed (so to speak) in
those things as in their true codes, according to which all particular
things take place and are arranged; nay, these mutable particular things
depend so intimately and essentially (so to phrase it) upon the fixed
things, that they cannot either be conceived without them.

\[102\] (1) But, though this be so, there seems to be no small
difficulty in arriving at the knowledge of these particular things, for
to conceive them all at once would far surpass the powers of the human
understanding. (2) The arrangement whereby one thing is understood,
before another, as we have stated, should not be sought from their
series of existence, nor from eternal things. (3) For the latter are all
by nature simultaneous. (4) Other aids are therefore needed besides
those employed for understanding eternal things and their laws. (5)
However, this is not the place to recount such aids, nor is there any
need to do so, until we have acquired a sufficient knowledge of eternal
things and their infallible laws, and until the nature of our senses has
become plain to us.

\[103\] (1) Before betaking ourselves to seek knowledge of particular
things, it will be seasonable to speak of such aids, as all tend to
teach us the mode of employing our senses, and to make certain
experiments under fixed rules and arrangements which may suffice to
determine the object of our inquiry, so that we may therefrom infer what
laws of eternal things it has been produced under, and may gain an
insight into its inmost nature, as I will duly show. (2) Here, to return
to my purpose, I will only endeavor to set forth what seems necessary
for enabling us to attain to knowledge of eternal things, and to define
them under the conditions laid down above.

\[104\] (1) With this end, we must bear in mind what has already been
stated, namely, that when the mind devotes itself to any thought, so as
to examine it, and to deduce therefrom in due order all the legitimate
conclusions possible, any falsehood which may lurk in the thought will
be detected; but if the thought be true, the mind will readily proceed
without interruption to deduce truths from it. (104:2) This, I say, is
necessary for our purpose, for our thoughts may be brought to a close by
the absence of a foundation.

\[105\] (1) If, therefore, we wish to investigate the first thing of
all, it will be necessary to supply some foundation which may direct our
thoughts thither. (2) Further, since method is reflective knowledge, the
foundation which must direct our thoughts can be nothing else than the
knowledge of that which constitutes the reality of truth, and the
knowledge of the understanding, its properties, and powers. (3) When
this has been acquired we shall possess a foundation wherefrom we can
deduce our thoughts, and a path whereby the intellect, according to its
capacity, may attain the knowledge of eternal things, allowance being
made for the extent of the intellectual powers.

\[106\] (1) If, as I stated in the first part, it belongs to the nature
of thought to form true ideas, we must here inquire what is meant by the
faculties and power of the understanding. (2) The chief part of our
method is to understand as well as possible the powers of the intellect,
and its nature; we are, therefore, compelled (by the considerations
advanced in the second part of the method) necessarily to draw these
conclusions from the definition itself of thought and understanding.
