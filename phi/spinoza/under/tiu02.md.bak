*On the Improvement of Understanding*, by Benedict de Spinoza, \[1883\],
at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[Notice to the Reader.\]

(This notice to the reader was written by the editors of the Opera
Postuma in 1677. Taken from Curley, Note 3, at end)

\*This Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect etc., which we give
you here, kind reader, in its unfinished \[that is, defective\] state,
was written by the author many years ago now. He always intended to
finish it. But hindered by other occupations, and finally snatched away
by death, he was unable to bring it to the desired conclusion. But since
it contains many excellent and useful things, which—we have no
doubt—will be of great benefit to anyone sincerely seeking the truth, we
did not wish to deprive you of them. And so that you would be aware of,
and find less difficult to excuse, the many things that are still
obscure, rough, and unpolished, we wished to warn you of them.
Farewell.\*
