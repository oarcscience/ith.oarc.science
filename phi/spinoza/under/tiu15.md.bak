*On the Improvement of Understanding*, by Benedict de Spinoza, \[1883\],
at Intangible Textual Heritage

### MENTAL HINDRANCES FROM WORDS—AND FROM THE POPULAR CONFUSION OF READY IMAGINATION WITH DISTINCT UNDERSTANDING

\[86\] (1) Hence, as far as is possible at the outset, we have acquired
a knowledge of our understanding, and such a standard of a true idea
that we need no longer fear confounding truth with falsehood and
fiction. (2) Neither shall we wonder why we understand some things which
in nowise fall within the scope of the imagination, while other things
are in the imagination but wholly opposed to the understanding, or
others, again, which agree therewith. (3) We now know that the
operations, whereby the effects of imagination are produced, take place
under other laws quite different from the laws of the understanding, and
that the mind is entirely passive with regard to them.

\[87\] (1) Whence we may also see how easily men may fall into grave
errors through not distinguishing accurately between the imagination and
the understanding; such as believing that extension must be localized,
that it must be finite, that its parts are really distinct one from the
other, that it is the primary and single foundation of all things, that
it occupies more space at one time than at another and other similar
doctrines, all entirely opposed to truth, as we shall duly show.

\[88\] (1) Again, since words are a part of the imagination—that is,
since we form many conceptions in accordance with confused arrangements
of words in the memory, dependent on particular bodily conditions,—there
is no doubt that words may, equally with the imagination, be the cause
of many and great errors, unless we strictly on our guard.

\[89\] (1) Moreover, words are formed according to popular fancy and
intelligence, and are, therefore, signs of things as existing in the
imagination, not as existing in the understanding. (2) This is evident
from the fact that to all such things as exist only in the
understanding, not in the imagination, negative names are often given,
such as incorporeal, infinite, &c. (3) So, also, many conceptions really
affirmative are expressed negatively, and vice versa, such as uncreate,
independent, infinite, immortal, &c., inasmuch as their contraries are
much more easily imagined, and, therefore, occurred first to men, and
usurped positive names. (89:4) Many things we affirm and deny, because
the nature of words allows us to do so, though the nature of things does
not. (5) While we remain unaware of this fact, we may easily mistake
falsehood for truth.

\[90\] (1) Let us also beware of another great cause of confusion, which
prevents the understanding from reflecting on itself. (2) Sometimes,
while making no distinction between the imagination and the intellect,
we think that what we more readily imagine is clearer to us; and also we
think that what we imagine we understand. (3) Thus, we put first that
which should be last: the true order of progression is reversed, and no
legitimate conclusion is drawn.
