*On the Improvement of Understanding*, by Benedict de Spinoza, \[1883\],
at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CERTAIN RULES OF LIFE

\[17\] (1) Yet, as it is necessary that while we are endeavoring to
attain our purpose, and bring the understanding into the right path we
should carry on our life, we are compelled first of all to lay down
certain rules of life as provisionally good, to wit the following:—I.
(2) To speak in a manner intelligible to the multitude, and to comply
with every general custom that does not hinder the attainment of our
purpose. (3) For we can gain from the multitude no small advantages,
provided that we strive to accommodate ourselves to its understanding as
far as possible: moreover, we shall in this way gain a friendly audience
for the reception of the truth.

II\. (17:4) To indulge ourselves with pleasures only in so far as they
are necessary for preserving health.

III\. (5) Lastly, to endeavor to obtain only sufficient money or other
commodities to enable us to preserve our life and health, and to follow
such general customs as are consistent with our purpose.

\[18\] (1) Having laid down these preliminary rules, I will betake
myself to the first and most important task, namely, the amendment of
the understanding, and the rendering it capable of understanding things
in the manner necessary for attaining our end. (2) In order to bring
this about, the natural order demands that I should here recapitulate
all the modes of perception, which I have hitherto employed for
affirming or denying anything with certainty, so that I may choose the
best, and at the same time begin to know my own powers and the nature
which I wish to perfect.
