*On the Improvement of Understanding*, by Benedict de Spinoza, \[1883\],
at Intangible Textual Heritage

# SECOND PART OF METHOD

### ITS OBJECT, THE ACQUISITION OF CLEAR AND DISTINCT IDEAS

\[91\] \[91e\] (1) Now, in order at length to pass on to the second part
of this method, I shall first set forth the object aimed at, and next
the means for its attainment. (2) The object aimed at is the acquisition
of clear and distinct ideas, such as are produced by the pure intellect,
and not by chance physical motions. (3) In order that all ideas may be
reduced to unity, we shall endeavor so to associate and arrange them
that our mind may, as far as possible, reflect subjectively the reality
of nature, both as a whole and as parts.

\[92\] (1) As for the first point, it is necessary (as we have said) for
our purpose that everything should be conceived, either solely through
its essence, or through its proximate cause. (2) If the thing be
self-existent, or, as is commonly said, the cause of itself, it must be
understood through its essence only; if it be not self-existent, but
requires a cause for its existence, it must be understood through its
proximate cause. (3) For, in reality, the knowledge, \[92f\] of an
effect is nothing else than the acquisition of more perfect knowledge of
its cause.

\[93\] (1) Therefore, we may never, while we are concerned with
inquiries into actual things, draw any conclusion from abstractions; we
shall be extremely careful not to confound that which is only in the
understanding with that which is in the thing itself. (2) The best basis
for drawing a conclusion will be either some particular affirmative
essence, or a true and legitimate definition. (93:3) For the
understanding cannot descend from universal axioms by themselves to
particular things, since axioms are of infinite extent, and do not
determine the understanding to contemplate one particular thing more
than another.
