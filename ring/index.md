J.R.R. Tolkiens' Middle Earth did not come out of thin air. Tolkien, an
academic linguist, drew on the following source materials to inspire his
world-building exercise. The texts presented at this site are complete
and in some cases in the original languages.

[The Kalevala. \[English\]](../neu/kveng/index.md)  
[The Kalevala. \[Finnish\]](../neu/kvfin/index.md)  
This Finnish saga, replete with battling wizards and heroes, quests and
magical objects has been cited as one of the early inspirations for
Tolkien. The languages of Middle Earth also have more than a passing
resemblance to Finnish.

[The Elder (Poetic) Edda.](../neu/poe/index.md)  
[The Younger (Prose) Edda.](../neu/pre/index.md)  
These Icelandic collections of epic poetry are key sources for the study
of Norse mythology. Our plane of existence is called 'Middle Earth' in
this mythology. Tolkien also took many of the names of key characters
from this text; particularly one sequence early on in the
[Voluspo](../neu/poe/poe03.md), including Gandalf, and all of the Dwarves
from the Hobbit. Also found in the Eddas is the forest of Myrkwood;
Bilbo's party traversed the vast Mirkwood forest in the Hobbit.

[Wagner's Ring of the Niblung](../neu/ron/index.md)  
[The Volsung Saga](../neu/vlsng/index.md)  
[The Nibelungenlied](../neu/nblng/index.md)  
The Volsung saga is the Icelandic version of the story which was later
re-told in the Germanic Nibelungenlied. This was the basis for Wagner's
Ring cycle. The cursed ring of doom is likewise a central theme of
Tolkiens' mythology.

[Heimskringla or The Chronicle of the Kings of
Norway](../neu/heim/index.md)  
by Snorri Sturlson. tr. Samuel Laing \[1844\]  
Gandalf is not only mentioned in the Voluspo, but in the Heimskringla
Sagas: Gandalf was the name of the last king to rule over Alfheim, He
was killed by Harald Harfagra in the year 866. Gandalf gets mentioned in
[The Ynglinga Saga](../neu/heim/02ynglga.md), [Halfdan, the Black
Saga](../neu/heim/03halfdn.md), and [Harald Harfager's
Saga](../neu/heim/04harfgr.md).

Saxon\]](../neu/asbeo.md)</span>   <span class="c_b">The original monster
story, in the original Old English</span>. Tolkien was a distinguished
scholar of Middle and Old English. The Beowulf saga is one of the
treasures of this branch of literature, and Grendel, the monster of this
tale, is a prototype for many of the darker creatures that populate
Middle Earth. </span>

Book.</span> Among the sources for Tokien's languages was Welsh, and the
Welsh stories of the 'Red Book of Hergest' appear to have also had an
influence on the narratives of Tolkien's fictional 'Red Book of
Westmarch'. </span>

### Modern Fantasy

[The Faerie Queene](../neu/eng/fq/index.md), by Edmund Spenser \[1596\]  
[Stories from the Faerie Queene](../neu/eng/sfq/index.md), by Mary Macleod
\[1916\]   <span class="c_b">The Faerie Queene is one of the wellsprings
of modern Fantasy writing.</span> Spenser, like Tolkien, did not simply
retell classical or medieval stories. He used similar themes and
elements but put the pieces together in an entirely new way,
constructing an invented reality with a consistent internal logic.

<span class="c_b">Lord Dunsany paved the way for Tolkien with his
delightful internally consistent fantasy worlds.</span> </span>

the World is one of Morris' masterpieces which he originally published

was [William Morris](../neu/morris/index.md), skilled artist, pioneering
Socialist, translator of Icelandic sagas, and fantasy writer. </span>
