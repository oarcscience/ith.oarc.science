> ART. XI.--*Vidhûra Jâtaka*. (No. 548 of Ceylon List.) \[From the
> Burmese.\] By R. F. ST. ANDREW ST. JOHN, M.R.A.S.

ONE day, when the disciples were discussing the various forms of wisdom
peculiar to the Buddha, the Lord came into the hall and inquired what
they were discussing. On being informed, he said: "Rabans, there will be
no difficulty in understanding how I can now so easily overcome the
opinions of Brahmans, princes, and others, bringing them to a right
frame of mind, when you hear how, in a former existence as the high-born
Vidhûra, on the summit of Mount Kâ.lâgiri, I overcame and subdued the
virulence of the Rakshasa Pu.n.naka." He then related as follows:--

   Long ago, in Kururajja"m, in the city of Indapattanagara"m, there
reigned a king whose name was Dhanañcaya Korabya, whose prime minister,
Vidhûra, expounded the law so well and sweetly that everyone was
attracted to him, and all the rulers of Jambudvîpa came to get his
decisions. Now in the city of Bârânasi there were four rich Brahmans who
were friends, and they, having determined to renounce the lusts of this
world, went into Himavanta. Having dwelt there some time as hermits,
they came into the inbabited country in search of salt and pickles, and
at last arrived at Campânagara"m, in the country of A"nga, and dwelt in
the king's garden. The rich people of the city, seeing that their
deportment was correct, undertook their maintenance, and begged them to
remain. One of these hermits, in a state of ecstatic meditation, used to
go daily to the country of the Nâgas, another to Tâvatisma, another to
the country of the Ga.lunas, and the fourth to the park called Migâjina,
which belonged to King Dhanañcaya Korabya, at Indapattanagara"m. On
<span id="page_442">p. 442</span> returning, each praised the delights
of these places to his particular supporters, so that each desired, when
the time of change came, to go to these places.

   When they at length died, by reason of the good works they had
performed, one became Sakko, another became king of the Nâgas, another
became king of the Ga.lunas in a forest of silk-cotton trees, and the
fourth took birth with the chief queen of King Dhanañcaya Korabya. At
his father's death Prince Korabya succeeded to the throne.

   King Korabya was passionately fond of dice, but abiding by the
instructions of his minister Vidhûra, observed his fasts and religious
duties. One fast-day, in order to be quiet, he went into his garden.
Sakko, the Nâga king, and the Ga.luna king, also came to that garden to
spend the fast-day in quiet meditation; and, in the cool of the evening,
all four met at the auspicious water-tank and recognized each other.
Sakko sat on the auspicious stone slab, and the others seated themselves
in suitable places.

   Sakko then asked: "Which of us four kings, do you think, has
performed the most excellent duty?"

   Varu.na, the Nâga king, answered: "I think mine is the best. The
Ga.lunas generally take our lives, and yet, when I saw their king, I
displayed no anger."

   The King of the Ga.lunas said: "This Nâga king is the food in which
we most delight, and yet, though oppressed by hunger, I did him no
harm."

   Sakko said: "I have left the wonderful pleasures and delights of
Tâvatimsa and come down to this earth to keep my fast."

   Then said King Korabya: "I have left the delights of my palace and
sixty thousand concubines and come to fast in this garden."

   Thus the four kings extolled their own piety.

   Then said the three kings: "O King Korabya, have you no wise man in
your dominions who can dispel our doubts in this matter?" King
Dhanañcaya Korabya answered: "I have a wise minister named Vidhûra, and
he will probably be able to do so."

<span id="page_443">p. 443</span>

   So they all agreed to go to the Judgment Hall, and, having caused
Vidhûra to take his seat on a splendid couch, stated their case to him.

   Vidhûra (after questioning them) replied: "O kings, your words are
all good, and there is no fault in them. Wise men say that, like an axle
well fitted to the hub of a wheel, those persons who are longsuffering,
who do no ill to obtain food, who avoid lust, and have no anxiety, are
they who in this world have extinguished evil" (Sama.na"m).

   On hearing this, the four kings gave great praise to Vidhûra, and
said: "Indeed, thou art a religious person. There is no one equal to
thee. Thou canst decide clearly, as the worker in ivory cuts through an
elephant's tusk with a saw."

   Sakko presented him with a valuable cloth. The King of the Ga.lunas
gave him a golden flower garland. The King of the Nâgas presented him
with a priceless ruby; and King Korabya gave him one thousand milch
cows, ten bulls, ten elephants, ten horses, ten chariots with Sindh
horses, and the revenue of sixteen villages.

   Now the King of the Nâgas had a queen, whose name was Vimalâ, and,
when he returned, she noticed that the ruby he usually wore round his
neck was gone, so she said: "My Lord, where have you left your ruby?" He
answered: "Lady, I wished to do honour to Vidhûra, the son of Canda, the
Brahman, who decided a case for me, and gave it to him. Sakko gave him a
cloth. The Ga.luna king gave him a gold garland, and King Korabya also
gave gifts."

   Queen Vimalâ asked whether he was one who preached the law; and on
being told that there was no one equal to him, she thought thus: "If I
were to say--'My Lord, I want to hear him preach the law: bring him
here,' the King would not bring him. I will say that I want this wise
man's heart, and, by worrying the King, get what I want." So she went
into her inner chamber, and, giving notice to her attendants, went to
sleep. On that day the Nâga king, at the time when the Queen and
concubines usually came to pay their respects to him, missing Vimalâ,
asked where she <span id="page_444">p. 444</span> was. They told him she
could not come, because she was ill. Hearing this, he got up from his
seat, and, going to her couch and stroking her with his hand, said:
"Lady, you are like a withered leaf, and your body emaciated. What ails
you?"

   Queen Vimalâ answered: "O Lord of the Nâgas, in the land of men if
women do not get what they want they suffer great pain. I have a strong
desire to obtain the heart of this wise Vidhûra, lawfully and not by
force. When I have obtained his heart I shall be well. If I do not, I
shall shortly die."

   The King answered: "Lady, if you wanted the sun, or the moon, there
would be no difficulty. Even the kings of the island of Jambudvîpa find
a difficulty in getting to see him. How, then, can he be brought here?"

   Hearing this, the Queen turned her back on the King, saying: "If I
cannot get the heart of Vidhûra, may I die on this very bed."

   When the King found she would not answer him he went into his chamber
and threw himself on his couch, saying: "Who can bring Vidhûra's heart?
Verily the Queen will die if she cannot get it."

   Just then the Princess Irandhatî<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> came, magnificently dressed, to pay her
respects to her father, and, seeing him so unhappy, said: "My father,
you seem very unhappy: why is it?"

   Her father replied: "My daughter, your mother wants the heart of the
wise Vidhûra; but who can bring him to Nâga-land? Dear daughter, you are
the only person who can do it. If you wish to save your mother's life,
search for a husband who can bring him." The King was so wrapped up in
his desire to preserve his Queen's life, that he spoke thus shamefully
to her, telling her to get a husband.

   Irandhatî, having pacified her father, went in to see her mother,
and, after comforting her, dressed herself in all her

<span class="small">\[1. Irandhatî: is this a form of Arundhatî, one of
the stars, and said to be the wife of the seven Rishis?\]</span>

<span id="page_445">p. 445</span> ornaments and, that very night, took
her way through the water to the upper world, and went to a place in the
Himavanta near a river where there is a mountain called Kâ.la. That
mountain is sixty yûjanâs in height, and entirely composed of black
rocks. Having gone thither, she collected a number of beautiful flowers,
and strewed them all over the mountain, and made it look as if it were a
heap of rubies; she spread a bed of flowers on the summit, and began to
dance and sing, saying<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>--

</table>

   Just then Pu.n.naka, the nephew of the Deva Vessava.n (Kuvera),
riding on his horse Manomaya, was on his way to the assembly of the
Rakshasas, and heard her song. As she had once been his wife in a former
existence, as soon as he heard her he was smitten with delight, and,
stopping his horse, said: "Lady, by the power of my wisdom, I will bring
you Vidhûra's heart. Be not afraid. You shall be my wife."

   On hearing this, Irandhatî replied: "Go at once and demand me of my
father."

   Overcome with love, Pu.n.naka dismounted and stretched out his hand
to put Irandhatî on his horse, but she drew back, saying:

 

*Irandhatî.*

      Back, Pu.n.naka, nor take me by the hand;  
      I am no orphan to be brought to shame:

<span class="small">\[1. The gâta of Irandhatî's song have been left
out, except the first line, and only the Bur. translation
given.\]</span>

       <span id="page_446">p. 446</span> Varu.na, lord of serpents, is
my sire,  
      And Vimalâ, my mother, his chief queen.  
      If, then, to wed me be thy firm desire,  
      Demand me from them in accustomed form.  

 

   Hearing this, Pu.n.naka at once proceeded to the Serpent King's
palace, and addressed him thus:--

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

      Lord of the Nâgas, list unto my suit,  
      And give Irandhatî to me for wife.  
      Ages have passed since first our lots were linked:  
      I love her still, and she to me inclines.  
      Take as her price one hundred elephants,  
      One hundred steeds, and e'en one hundred carts  
      Piled with the seven gems, to which are yoked  
      One hundred mules: an offering far too small.  
      But who could name a price for one so fair?  

 

*Varu.na.*

      O Raksha Prince, Vessava.n's nephew true,  
      Fitted in every way to be my son-in-law  
      Art thou; but not in haste may this be done:  
      A hurried marriage ofttimes causes woe.  
      First with my queen and kith I must consult.  
      Irandhatî is but a child, and 'tis  
      The nature of all womenfolk to pine  
      When parted from their home. Perchance she, too,  
      May grieve when taken hence. Wait here awhile.  

(He enters the palace and addresses Queen Vimalâ.)

      Queen of my queens, my well-loved Vimalâ,  
      There waits without, in haste to wed our child  
      Irandhatî, the darling of our heart,  
      Vessava.n's nephew, chief of all his hosts.  
      His gifts and words are fair. What thinkest thou?  

<span id="page_447">p. 447</span>

 

*Vimalâ.*

      Lord of this widespread realm, we need no gifts:  
      Irandhatî, whose beauty glads all hearts  
      Cannot be bought with gems: 'tis he alone  
      Who brings Vidhûra's heart shall wed the maid.  

 

*Varu.na* (coming out).

      Leader of hosts, if our consent you'd win,  
      Bring us the "wise man's" heart, thy lawful spoil.  

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

      Some are called wise and others are called fools;  
      But on this point all men are not agreed.  
      How shall I know the wise man from the fool?  

 

*Varu.na.*

      What! hast not heard of Râja Korabya,  
      Who reigns at Indapattan? and of him  
      Who guides with perfect wisdom his affairs,  
      All-wise Vidhûra? 'Tis his heart we want.  

   Pu.n.naka ordered his attendant to get ready his horse Manomaya, and,
urged by his great love for Irandhatî, having smoothed out his beard and
hair and arranged his clothes, mounted and set off on his way to the
dwelling of his uncle Kuvera (Vessava.n).

   On arriving there he recited some stanzas descriptive of the beauty
and wealth of Kuvera's city. He recited these verses because he did not
dare to carry off Vidhûra without his uncle's permission. Kuvera,
however, was deciding a dispute between two devas, and did not attend to
him, so Pu.n.naka sat down near the deva who had won his case. Kuvera,
turning to the deva, gave him an order to go and take possession, so
Pu.n.naka took the order as if it were given to himself, and went off
with him. On the way he thought thus: "Vidhûra's attendants are very
<span id="page_448">p. 448</span> numerous; I shall not be able to take
him unawares. King Korabya is passionately fond of dice. I will win him
from Korabya by a cast of the dice. King Korabya is very wealthy, and
will not play with me for anything of small value. In the hill of
Vepulla, near Râjagriha, there is a ruby fit to be worn by Cakkavatti
monarchs; it is a ruby of great power. I will overcome him by means of
that ruby." He accordingly went to Râjagriha, in the country of A"nga.

   (The translator here remarks: "Why is it said that Râjagriha is in
A"nga, when it is in Magadha?"--It is because at that time the King of
A"nga ruled over Magadha.)

   Ascending to the top of Mount Vepulla, he came to the place where
that wonderful ruby which is called Manohara (Captivating) is guarded by
100,000 Kumbha.n.das. Terrifying them by his terrible glances, he took
the ruby and pursued his way to Indapattanagara"m. On arriving there, he
got off his horse and left it in concealment near the city. Taking the
form of a young man, he approached King Korabya and addressed him
thus:--

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

   "In this assembly of chiefs, who will play with me for an excellent
stake? From which of you shall I be able to win something of value? Who
of you wants to win my incomparable treasure?"

 

*Korabya.*

   "Youth, what is your country? Your speech is not that of Kururâj, and
your appearance is more comely than that of the people of my country.
Tell me your race and name."

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

   "King, I bear the noble title of Kaccâya.no. As for my parents and
race, they dwell in the city of Kâlacampanagara"m in A"nga; and I have
come to this country to cast dice."

<span id="page_449">p. 449</span>

 

*Korabya.*

   "Since you have come here to gamble, what have you brought with you?
If you have nothing, will not the princes who overcome you make you
their slave? How, then, do you propose to play against princes?"

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

   "My lord king, my stake is a ruby.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> It is of immense value--more valuable
than any other. It brings whatever you desire, and is called Manohara.
That is not my only property: I possess a steed that can drive away all
my enemies. I will play for both of them. Let the winner take them."

 

*Korabya.*

   "Youth, what can you do with your one ruby and horse? We kings have
many such rubies, and swift steeds innumerable."

(Here ends the canto called "Doha.la."<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>)

\*      \*      \*      \*      \*      \*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

   "My lord king, why do you speak thus? My horse is worth a thousand,
and my ruby is worth a thousand. Though your Majesty may have horses,
they are not like mine. Just look at the qualities of my horse." Saying
thus, he mounted Manomaya and rode round the city wall so fast that the
city appeared to be surrounded by

\[1. The ruby was not a red one, but a Ve.luriyam.

2\. Doha.la, "longing for"; more especially applied to that of women in
a certain condition.\]

<span id="page_450">p. 450</span> a band of horses, which could not be
distinguished, and even Pu.n.naka himself was not distinguishable, but
the red girdle on his waist was like the whirling of a firebrand. Having
thus displayed the good qualities of his horse, he dismounted and said:
"O King, have you beheld the power of my horse?" And, on the King
replying that he had seen it, he said, "Look again," and rode his horse
across the surface of the lake which was in the royal park, backwards
and forwards, so that not even its hoofs were wetted. Having caused it
to stand on a lily-leaf, he spread out his hand and it stood upon the
palm. When the King remarked, "This is, indeed, very wonderful," he
replied: "Now behold the power of my ruby. You have only to look into it
to see<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> everything that is in
this city or on the face of the earth, and all the delights of
Devaland."

(Here ends the canto called "The Ruby.")

\*      \*      \*      \*      \*      \*

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

   "Surely, O King, if I gamble with you and lose, take my ruby. But
what will you stake?"

 

*Korabya.*

   "Kaccâya.no, I will stake anything but myself, my queen, or my
throne."

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

   "If that be so, O King, since I am from a distant country and cannot
tarry long, make ready the gaming-place."

   So the King summoned all his nobles, and ordered a place to be
prepared. The nobles, having spread curiously-worked carpets and
arranged places for the King and his hundred nobles, suitably to their
rank, reported to the King that all was ready.

   Then Pu.n.naka requested the King to come to the

<span class="small">\[1. The description of what may be seen in the ruby
is too long to translate.\]</span>

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span> gaming-place, and: said: "My lord
king, you have stated that you will play with me for anything save your
royal person, your queen, or your throne, and your words are as ivory
\[*i.e.* firm\]; but I am a poor person and you are the lord of many. If
you win, you will assuredly take my ruby; but if I lose, you may delay
in paying me, and fall back upon the fact that you are a king: how,
then, can I play on equal terms?" But the King replied: "Kaccâya.no, be
not afraid; whether I win or lose I will act according to the law."

   So Pu.n.naka called all the kings who were present to bear witness,
saying: "Kings of Pancala, Paccuggata, Sûrasena, Madda, and Kebhi, who
are here assembled, you have heard the words of Korabya your lord. Take
good note of them. You are all law-abiding kings, and I call upon you to
be my witnesses, without fear or favour; listen and watch between us,
and according to the custom of the righteous, with heed, observe
closely, and do that which is right."

   Thereupon King Korabya, surrounded by a hundred princes, proceeded to
the gaming-shed, and they sat in their appointed places; and King
Korabya placed the golden dice upon a silver table.

   Then Pu.n.naka said suddenly: "My lord king, the marks upon the dice
are called 'thé,' 'than,' 'einzé,' and 'nguzon'<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>: take which you please." The King
elected to take "einzé" and Pu.n.naka took "than."

   The King then called upon Pu.n.naka to throw first; but Pu.n.naka
said: "My lord king, I am a poor man: it is not right that I should
begin; it is for you to throw first." So the King agreed.

   Now there was a fairy, who had been his mother in his third state of
existence, who constantly looked after King Korabya, and through her
power he had always won when he played with dice. He used also to sing
the following verses whenever he played: (Sabbâ nadî viñka nadî, etc.),
which mean--

<span class="small">\[1. These words are not given in the Bur.
Dictionary, but according to the text *thé* = 8, *than* = 6, *einzé* =
4, and *nguzon* = 2.\]</span>

   In order to invoke his fairy guardian he sang as follows:--

<tr class="odd">
<td>O fairy, now my guardian be;<br />

Sweet fairy, ever kind to me,<br />
Come now and bring me victory.</td>

   Then King Korabya, singing his gambling song, threw the dice into the
air, but through Pu.n.naka's power they fell so that he would have lost;
knowing, however, by his great skill that this would happen, he caught
them before they fell on the silver table and again threw them into the
air, but seeing that they would a second time fall against him, he again
caught them in his hand.

   Seeing this, Pu.n.naka looked round to see the reason, and observed
the good fairy standing near the King. He thereupon glared fiercely at
the fairy, and she fled terrified to the top of a mountain on the
confines of the world. The King then threw them again thrice, but by
Pu.n.naka's power was prevented from putting out his hand to catch them
before they fell. Then Pu.n.naka threw, and seeing that he had won, rose
from his seat and cried, "I have won, I have won." And the sound of his
voice was heard throughout all Jambudvîpa.

   King Korabya was very sad at having lost, so Pu.n.naka, in order to
comfort him, said: "My lord king, when two persons have a wager each
puts forth all his strength

<span class="small">\[1. See Jataka No. 62.\]</span>

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span> to win, but both cannot do so--one
must lose; and so it is in this dicing: your Majesty, however, has not
lost your own person. Be not cast down, but give me that precious thing
that I have won, and let me depart, for I have come from afar and may
not delay."

 

*Korabya.*

   "Youth Kaccâya.no, I have everything that is on the face of this
earth: take what you want and go."

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

   "My lord king, in your realm there are elephants, horses, precious
stones, and lovely virgins, but the greatest treasure of all is Vidhûra,
'the wise minister.' In accordance with your promise give him to me."

 

*Korabya.*

   "Kaccâya.no, before we began to play I said I would stake anything
but myself, my queen, or my throne, and this Vidhûra is as my very self,
and you ought not to take him. It is on him that I rely. He is even
greater than I, for I worship him. He is the source of my good fortune
and like an island of refuge."

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

   "My lord king, as I have far to go and cannot stay to argue the
question, let us call Vidhûra and abide by his decision."

 

*Korabya.*

   "Kaccâya.no, you are honest in all your actions: I am pleased with
your suggestion. We will go to Vidhûra and abide by his decision." So
the King, accompanied by all his nobles, took Pu.n.naka with him and
went to the Hall of Justice.

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>

   When Vidhûra saw the King coming he descended from the judgment-seat
and sat in a suitable place. Pu.n.naka then addressed him thus: "O wise
minister, you are well established in the law, and would not speak
falsely even to save your life. These things are known unto all men. I,
too, would know this, O wise one--Art thou the servant of the King, or
one of his kin?"

 

*Vidhûra.*

   "Youth, I am not of the King's kith, neither am I greater, but I am
one of his servants. Of these there are four classes,<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> viz.: the house-born, the purchased,
the self-made, and the captive. As I am one that pays respect to the
King, I am a 'self-made' slave, and though I may be taken to another
country, I shall still be the servant of the King. And if the King for
any reason give me to you, or another, his gift will be lawful."

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

   "O princes, my victory is twofold. As for this king of kings, his
wish was contrary to law. Why should he not give me this wise Vidhûra,
who has given a true decision?"

 

*Korabya* (in anger).

   "O Vidhûra, though I have honoured and raised you to high estate, you
have no regard for me, but regard only the face of the youth Kaccâya.no,
whom you have only just seen. Youth, take this true slave and go thy
way."

(End of the canto called "The Dice-throwing.")

\*      \*      \*      \*      \*      \*

   The King, thinking he might still detain Vidhûra by getting him to
solve difficult questions, asked him as follows:

   Now when Vidhûra returned from conducting the King back to his
palace, Pu.n.naka said: "Vidhûra, you have been given to me by the King
and must go with me as my servant. Look closely to my advantage, for
wise men have said that whosoever acts only for the good of his lord
becomes well acquainted with it."

 

*Vidhûra.*

   "Young man, I know that you have got possession of me, and that it
was because the King gave me to you. It was for your good also that I
answered his questions. In return for this kindness remain two or three
days in my house, and allow me to instruct my wives and children."

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

   "Vidhûra, I will remain with you a few days, and during that time set
your affairs in order and instruct your wives and children."

 

   So Pu.n.naka went with Vidhûra to his house.

   Now Vidhûra's house was built in three mansions, one suitable for
each season. They were named<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>
Kuñjara, Mayura, and Piyaka. They were as well appointed as that of
Sakko. So Vidhûra installed Pu.n.naka in one of those mansions, with
everything that he could want and 500 damsels to attend upon him, and
retired to the one in which his family was living, and entering into the
chamber of his wife Anu.lâ, told her to call all his children; but she,
by reason of her great grief, was unable to do so, and sent her
daughter-in-law, saying: "My tender and loving daughter-in-law,
beautiful as the flower of the blue lotus (Indavaramuppala"m), go and
summon my son Dhammapâla and your other brothers-in-law."

   Vidhûra received them with streaming eyes, and embraced them; and
after a little while, having come out into the

<span class="small">\[1. Kuñjara, "elephant." Mayura, "peacock." Piyaka,
"a spotted deer." But these names are also connected with certain
plants.\]</span>

<span id="page_457">p. 457</span> reception hall, thus addressed his
sorrowing family:--"My beloved children, I, your father, may only remain
here in peace for three days, and after that must go away with the youth
Kaccâya.no and obey his commands. Indeed, he desires to depart on this
very day, but, as I had not given you my instructions, I begged him to
remain a day or two. I will now tell you your line of conduct, and do
you all take it well to heart; and if the king asks you, when you go
into his presence, whether your father gave you any commands, you can
relate to him all I now say, and when he hears your words he will
remember me with regret, and appoint you to proper posts." On hearing
these words his family wept bitterly.

(Here ends the canto called "Lakkha.na.")

\*      \*      \*      \*      \*      \*

   When the weeping had ceased, he said: "My children, be not afraid:
all the laws of 'Bhûmakasa"nkhâra' are impermanent.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> Wealth and riches are lost and
destroyed. I will now relate to you the verses called 'Râjavasatî,'
attention to which will ensure earthly wealth and happiness."

   On the third day Vidhûra, having bathed and dressed himself, went to
the King's palace, to pay his respects and take leave,--and addressed
the King thus:--"My lord king, this young man is taking me away; his
mind is set upon going. I would speak to thee concerning the good of my
family: listen, victorious one. When the youth asked me how I was
related to thee, I truly replied that I was thy servant. That, indeed,
is the only fault, as far as I can see, that I have committed. If a man
slips upon the earth

\[1. That is to say, "he should not look at the king's face, but stand
with averted eyes."

2\. The first line of 44 runs thus: "Kumbhaññhi pañjalim kayirâ \|
câtañcâpi padakkhi.na"m." The meaning is obscure, and the Burmese
translation is: "On beholding pots full of water, kingfishers and other
birds, though they can give no advantages, yet we salute them with
raised hands."\]

<span id="page_462">p. 462</span> and falls, on that spot even be must
remain. That slip of mine I look at as my fault. Be not angry with me
for that error, but take care of my family and possessions, and let them
not be destroyed."

 

*Korabya.*

   "It is not pleasant to hear that you must depart. I will endeavour by
some stratagem to prevent your departure. I will summon the youth to my
palace and secretly make away with him."

 

*Vidhûra.*

   "My Lord, though this thought of thine arises through love and pity
for me, it is not right; there is no benefit in it. Put it from thee and
think only of what is meritorious. All beings must grow old and die. I
bear no ill-will to this youth. He may beat me, or free me, or kill me.
Being his slave, I must submit to his will and go with him."

 

   So Vidhûra, having respectfully saluted the King, and admonished the
nobles and attendants, left the palace; and all the queens and ladies,
being unable to restrain their feelings, with dishevelled hair and
streaming eyes, beating their breasts, followed him in great sorrow. The
people of the city came in crowds to see him depart; and he exhorted
them, saying: "Be not sorrowful: actions, affections, seasons, food, are
all impermanent. Both one's earthly body and possessions must come to an
end; therefore, reflecting on these things, we should give alms and
observe our religious duties." Having thus admonished them and sent them
home, he proceeded to his house. Just then his son Dhammapâla, and the
rest of his family, having come out to look for him, met him at the
gate; and when he saw his children, being unable to restrain his sorrow,
he embraced them, weeping, and entered into his house. Now Vidhûra "the
wise" had a thousand sons, a thousand daughters, a thousand wives, and
seven hundred concubines, and very <span id="page_463">p. 463</span>
many slaves and kinsmen. The whole of these were smitten with grief and
sorrow, and lay prostrate as the "sal" trees when smitten by a whirlwind
from Mount Yugantara; and with a mighty murmur they besought him not to
leave them; but, having comforted them, and set his household affairs in
order, he left them and entered into the presence of Pu.n.naka, saying:
"Youth, in accordance with my wish, you have waited here in my palace
two or three days, and my instructions to my family are complete: do
according to your wish."

 

*Pu.n.nka.*

   "Since you have completed your arrangements let us depart, for the
distance we have to go is long. Without fear take hold of my horse's
tail, for this is the last time that you shall behold the habitation of
men."

Then, fearless as a lion, he uttered this act of truth: "May this cloth
with which my loins are now girt ne'er leave me as long as I require
it"; and, mounting on to the horse's crupper, and firmly grasping the
tail, he said: "Youth, I have firm hold of your horse's tail: go
whithersoever you desire."

   At that instant Pu.n.naka thought, "What is the use of my taking this
Vidhûra to a distant place? I will carry him to the Himavanta forest,
and, having dragged him through the ravines and thorn-brakes till the
life is out of him, cast his dead body into a chasm, and carry his heart
to Nâga-land." So he directed his horse Manomaya thither, and urged him
swiftly through the trees. But by the

<span class="small">\[1. "Gaccheyya duggatim." But Buddhists believe
that they will be tortured by devils in hell.\]</span>

<span id="page_464">p. 464</span> virtue of the Bodhisat's accumulated
merit the trees kept away from his body for the distance of a cubit.

   When Pu.n.naka looked back to see if he were dead, and beheld his
face shining with brightness, he again urged his horse thrice through
the thickets; but to no purpose. Being greatly enraged, he rode into a
mighty wind, but by the power of the Bodhisat it divided in two; and
though he did this seven times he was unable to kill him, so he carried
him off to the mountain called Kâ.lâgiri.

   Now Vidhûra's wives and family, thinking that he was a very long time
in the upper chamber with Pu.n.naka, ascended to see what he was doing;
and when they saw him not, raised a great cry, saying, "This demon in
the likeness of a youth has carried off our lord"; and they wept and
wailed bitterly. And when the King heard the sound thereof, he inquired
what was the matter; and when they told him, he comforted them, saying:
"Be not afraid, and cease from weeping, for he can preach the law
sweetly, and will bring that youth to reason. Do not be so disturbed: he
will soon return."

   When Pu.n.naka arrived at the top of Kâ.lâgiri, he thought--"If I do
not kill this Vidhûra I shall not get Irandhatî, and all my trouble will
be for nought. I will kill him, and, having taken out his heart, carry
it to Queen Vimalâ, and bear away Irandhatî to my abode. It will not,
however, do for me to kill him with my own hands, but I must cause his
death through fear." So he set Vidhûra down on the peak of the mountain,
and took the appearance of a frightful demon, which threw Vidhûra prone
on his back, and then held him between its tusks as if it would devour
him; but the Bodhisat was not in the least terrified. He then
endeavoured to frighten him by taking the appearances of a lion, a must
elephant, and a huge serpent; but the Bodhisat was not terrified by
them. Then, thinking he would grind him to powder, he caused a mighty
whirlwind to blow on him as he lay on the mountain-top; but that wind
did not even disturb one hair of his head. He then caused the whole
mountain <span id="page_465">p. 465</span> of Kâ.lâgiri to be agitated,
but was unable to terrify him; so he entered into the heart of the
mountain and yelled loudly, but, though the noise was terrible, the
Bodhisat was not disturbed.

   Finding that he could not terrify him by any of these means, he, in
the form of a frightful demon, took him by both feet and hurled him from
the top of Kâ.lâgiri; but the Bodhisat fell lightly, as a ball of
dressed cotton, at a distance of fifteen yûjanâs. Then, taking him up
again head downwards and finding that he was not yet dead, he hurled him
again into the heavens, and he fell at a distance of sixty yûjanâs.

   After this had been done, the Bodhisat thought--"He may hurl me away
again, or, taking me by the feet, beat me to death against this
mountain, but I shall not be afraid; for to say nothing of these
terrors, if at the end of this cycle, during the 'samva.t.tathâyî'
(desolation?),<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> even were I
cast down from the realms of Vehapphalo into bottomless void, yet by
reason of 'self-possession' I should have no fear; I should still be
Vidhûra, the wise minister of the King of Kuru." Then he said:--"Youth,
your appearance is that of a good man, but you are not so. Your
appearance is that of one who keeps himself under restraint, but you do
not do so. You do that which is evil and profitless. Your actions are
not meritorious. Why do you hurl me into these chasms? What advantage
will you gain by my death? I do not think you are a man, but a Rakshasa:
by what name are you known amongst Devas?"

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

   "Have you not heard of Pu.n.naka in the country of men? I am the
general of the armies of King Vessava.n. I desire to wed the lovely
Irandhatî, daughter of Vimalâ, the Queen of the Nâga king Varu.na; and
because I desire to wed her, it is my purpose to slay you."

<span class="small">\[1. See Childers, under "Kappo."\]</span>

<span id="page_466">p. 466</span>

 

*Vidhûra.*

   "O Pu.n.naka, descend not to the level of fools. Oftentimes men come
to destruction for doing the evil that they ought not to do. Why do you
want to marry this lovely Nâga princess? What profit will you get by my
death?"

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

   "O wise minister, I will tell you. I know not whether it was because
we were once married and loved each other in a former existence, but
from the first moment that I saw her I was urged by love to demand her
from the Nâga king, who informed me in the verses beginning
'Dujjemukho,' etc., that I must obtain lawfully, as her price, the heart
of Vidhûra; and, therefore, I desire to get your heart. I do not desire
to injure you for a mere idle whim. I won you lawfully and I desire to
take your heart lawfully and present it to the Nâga king, so that I may
obtain Irandhatî. And as your death would be a great advantage to me, I
have brought you to this place."

 

   The Bodhisat, on hearing this, reflected--"What does Vimalâ want with
my heart?<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> Varu.na, having
heard me preach the law, and having presented me with the ruby that
adorns her neck, will probably, when he returned to the Nâga country,
have praised my preaching before his queens and courtiers; and, on that
account, his chief queen, Vimalâ, wishing to hear me, has laid this
stratagem, and Varu.na, not understanding it, has sent this ignorant
Rakshasa Pu.n.naka, and he is ill-treating me owing to his bad
disposition. I indeed am wise, but if I die by the hand of this
Pu.n.naka what will be the use of my having been wise? I will even now
show him my power." So he said: "Youth, listen to the law called
'Sâdhunara,' and after you have heard it do with me according to your
desire."

   Pu.n.naka, saying to himself, "I do not think this law

<span class="small">\[1. Vidhûra either had the power of omniscience, or
Pu.n.naka thought aloud.\]</span>

<span id="page_467">p. 467</span> has ever been preached before to men
and devas," raised up Vidhûra and set him on his feet on the top of the
mountain, saying: "I have taken you out of the abyss and set you on the
mountain. I have other business besides taking your heart, so that no
good law may be unknown to men make it known to me."

   The Bodhisat answered: "Youth, since you have other business besides
taking my heart, and have saved me from the abyss, and, desiring to hear
the law called 'Sâdhunara,' have set me on the top of this mountain, I
also will declare this law unto you; but my body is covered with dust
and dirt, and it is not proper to preach when the body is defiled with
dirt: permit me, I pray you, to bathe."

   So Pu.n.naka brought bathing water, and caused the Bodhisat to bathe
in it; and when he had done, dressed him and anointed him with fairy
scents, and fed him with fairy food. Then, having prepared the top of
Kâ.lâgiri in a suitable manner for preaching the law, the Bodhisat,
sitting cross-legged, said--

<table data-align="center">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>"Follow him who goes before thee;<br />
Dry not, youth, the hand that's wet;<br />
Never to thy friend be faithless;<br />
Follow not the wanton's beck.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

These are the four precepts of the 'Sâdhunara,' and he who adheres to
them may be called a good man."

   Pu.n.naka, not being able to understand, answered: "O wise one, who
is he that has gone before? Why must one not dry the wet hand? Who is he
that errs against his friend? What is a wanton? Explain to me this law;
it is too difficult for me to understand."

   Whereupon the Bodhisat replied: "If another should confer acts of
hospitality on oneself, though he has never seen or met one before, to
that person one should in like manner repay with gratitude those acts
which he has done. This is the law called '*Yâtânuyâyî*.'

   "If, for even one night, one should rest in a person's house, and
obtain the slightest refreshment, one should not <span id="page_468">p.
468</span> transgress against that person, even in thought. This is the
law called '*Allapâ.ni parivajjaya*.'

   "Whosoever takes shelter beneath a tree, he should not break even a
branch or twig thereof; it is his friend. This is the law called
'*Mittadubbhi*.'

   "Though a badly-disposed woman be taken in marriage, and obtain all
the worldly goods it is possible to give her, yet, if she sees an
opportunity for entertaining a lover, she will do injury to her husband
without thought of gratitude. Verily, if a man be overcome by the
blandishments of such a woman and gives her all her desires, his profit
will be nought, and he will be harassed in body and mind. This is the
law called '*Asatînam nagacche*.'"

(Here ends the "Sâdhunara" canto.)

\*      \*      \*      \*      \*      \*

   The Bodhisat having thus preached the law, Pu.n.naka thought
thus:--"The wise one appears by these four laws to ask for his life. He
never saw my face before, and though I was not his close friend, yet he
treated me in his house as if I had dwelt with him aforetime. I enjoyed
his hospitality for three or four days, and now the only reason I have
for ill-treating him is for the sake of a woman. If I look at these four
laws I see that I have been false to my friend. If I were to kill him I
should verily be one who follows not the law called 'Sâdhunara,' and if
I am said to be one who does not according to this law I should not be
desired by the Nâga king's daughter. I will restore the wise one to his
country, and gladden the hearts of his people and family": so he said:
"O most excellent one, I dwelt in your home for several days, and you
fed me; you are indeed a friend against whom I should not transgress.
Truly, I will release you. I deserve not the Nâga king's darling;
through desire for her I ought not to have done this evil deed. Because
you have preached the law well I will free you from death."

   When he said this the Bodhisat answered: "O Deva, do not convey me to
my home yet. Since I have never yet <span id="page_469">p. 469</span>
beheld the treasures of the Nâga king, take me to Nâga-land."

   Pu.n.naka thereupon answered gladly: "We will go at once to the
glorious land of the Nâgas, and thou shalt behold it. That country is
full of all splendours and delights." When they arrived there,
Pu.n.naka, placing the Bodhisat behind him, went into the presence of
the Nâga king; and when the King saw them he said: "Youth, you went to
the country of men to fetch the heart of the wise Vidhûra: now that you
have brought him himself, is your purpose accomplished?"

   And Pu.n.naka answered: "My lord king of the Nâgas, you desired
Vidhûra, and he has come. I obtained him lawfully. Behold him. There is
great happiness in associating with good people, even though it be for a
moment."

(Here ends the chapter called "Kâ.lâgiri.")

\*      \*      \*      \*      \*      \*

   After the Nâga king had conversed thus with Pu.n.naka, he turned to
Vidhûra and said: "O wise nobleman, is it because of these unwonted
splendours, which you have not beheld in the country of men, that,
without fear of death, you are unable to pay respect to me, but remain
in a state of stupefaction? He who is afraid when opportunity arrives
cannot be called wise. Judging from your present conduct, I am of
opinion that your fame for wisdom amongst men is a mistake."

 

*The Bodhisat.*

   "O Nâga king, I have no fear of death. Who is likely to kill me?
Verily, beings should not bow to those whom they are about to kill;
neither should they bow down to those who are about to kill them."

 

*The Nâga king.*

   "Thy words are true, indeed; one should not bow down to the person
who ought to be slain, nor should one bow to the slayer. For who would
do obeisance to the person who desires to slay him?"

<span id="page_470">p. 470</span>

 

*The Bodhisat.*

   "O king of the Nâgas, this wealth and glory of yours are not lasting.
I will ask you one question. Why did you obtain this fairy palace? Did
you get it for nothing, or through the change of seasons? Was it wrought
by your hand, or was it given you by some fairy? How did you get it?"

 

*The Nâga king.*

   "O wise one, I got not this palace and wealth without cause; nor did
I get it through the natural changes of the seasons. It was not given to
me by the fairies; but I obtained it by merit accrued in a former
existence."

 

*The Bodhisat.*

   "O Nâga king, what was this meritorious action? What was the good
deed that you performed? Your glory and wealth are very great: of what
good deeds are they the result?"

 

*The Nâga king.*

   "O wise one, when I and my queen Vimalâ dwelt in the city of
Campânagara"m, in the country of A"nga, we were both of like mind as to
almsgiving, and never lost an opportunity for giving alms. Our house was
full of all those things that are bestowed on ascetics, as it were a
well of water, and we gave them the ten lawful gifts, viz.: rice, sweet
liquor, scent, unguents, lamp oil, cloths, mattrasses, couches,
monasteries, and medicine. As the result of those excellent deeds we
enjoy these delights."

 

*The Bodhisat.*

   "Since then, O Nâga king, you obtained this palace as the result of a
good deed, you know what is merit and also its results. Forget not this
knowledge, and continue to act upon it. If you do so you will in the
hereafter obtain another palace."

<span id="page_471">p. 471</span>

 

*The Nâga king.*

   "As there are no hermits or Brahmans in this country, as in the land
of men, I am unable to give alms. What meritorious action can I do here
so as to ensure a happy abode in the next state?"

 

*The Bodhisat.*

   "O King, be ever kind to your people, relations, and attendants,
chastening them with a loving hand if necessary. Be not angry with them.
By increasing your love and patience you will hereafter acquire a higher
station amongst the Devas."

 

*The Nâga king.*

   "Vidhûra, thou art the minister who art wont to instruct the intimate
friends of the King of Kuru, and Korabya himself, through being long
parted from you, is very sorrowful. He can only be comforted by your
return."

 

*The Bodhisat.*

   "O King, you say this through having reflected on the law of
righteousness. It is well known that my great qualities can assist him
in calamity."

 

*The Nâga king.*

   "Tell me truly, did Pu.n.naka obtain you for nothing or did he win
you by dice? He tells me that he obtained you lawfully."

 

*The Bodhisat.*

   "My lord king, Dhanañcaya lost me to Pu.n.naka by a throw of the
dice; and as I belonged to the King, he gave me to Pu.n.naka. He
obtained me lawfully."

 

*The Nâga king*

(Having taken Vidhûra into the Queen's chamber).

   "My Lady Vimalâ, you were sickly, downcast, and wasted on account of
the wise Vidhûra. He whom thou desiredst <span id="page_472">p.
472</span> is even this man here. He can dispel all wrath and darkness
from the hearts of men and Devas. O Queen Vimalâ, you desired his
heart's flesh; he has now come to you: listen to the law that be will
preach to you. It will be difficult to find his equal in wisdom."

 

   When Queen Vimalâ saw the Nâga king coming and leading Vidhûra by the
hand, with joy she raised her ten slender fingers to her head, and said:
"Wise one, thou payest not reverence through stupefaction on seeing such
splendours. It is a mistake to call thee 'wise.'"

 

*The Bodhisat.*

   "Nâga princess, I am not afraid through beholding you. Who would kill
one so wise as I am? Nâga princess, no one about to be slain makes
obeisance to his slayer, nor does the slayer do reverence to him whom he
is about to slay."

 

*Vimalâ.*

   "It is as you say, O wise one. A person should not do reverence to
those who intend to slay him."

 

   The Bodhisat then asks the Queen the same question as he asked the
King, and the Bodhisat preaches the law of kindness. The Queen states
that she is satisfied with having heard the "law," which is his "heart";
and that she thinks King Dhanañcaya Korabya must be very sorrowful at
being separated from him, and will be delighted to see him again.

   The Bodhisat replies that this is undoubtedly the case, as there is
no one so skilled in giving good advice as he is.

   The Queen asks him to tell her how Pu.n.naka managed to get
possession of him, and the Bodhisat replies: "Be not afraid, O Nâga, and
take no thought as to how to slay me. I present myself wholly to thee.
If you still desire my heart I will take it out and give it you, and if
you want my flesh I will cut it off and give it you."

<span id="page_473">p. 473</span>

 

*The Nâga king.*

   "O wise one, the 'heart' of a wise man is his wisdom. I have heard
you preach the law, and my desire is fulfilled. Since Pu.n.naka has
brought thee to this country, according to my wish, and both the wishes
of myself and queen have been fulfilled, we will give him our daughter
Irandhatî to wife; and do you, Pu.n.naka, this very day convey Vidhûra
back to Indapattanagara"m."

 

   So Pu.n.naka, being delighted at having obtained Irandhatî, said: "O
wise nobleman, I will repay you for the good you have done me by giving
you this 'Manohara' ruby, and this very day restore you to
Indapattanagara"m."

 

*The Bodhisat.*

   "May you dwell happily in your palace with this lovely Nâga princess
for the rest of your existence, and may nothing interfere with your
mutual love; and since you are a true friend, you may give me the ruby
and restore me to my home."

 

*Pu.n.naka.*

   "Good, let us depart. Get up on to my horse." And placing Vidhûra
before him on his horse "Manomaya," in an instant, after bidding
farewell to the Nâga king, they arrived in the country of Kuru, where
Pu.n.naka set him down, and, after again thanking him, rode off to the
realms of the four great Râjas.

   On the morning of the day on which Vidhûra returned, King Korabya
dreamed that there was a great tree near the door of his palace covered
with sweet fruit, and which gave shade and shelter to all kinds of
animals, and that all men made offerings and adorations to it. A
cruel-looking black man, carrying a sword and wearing a bright red
cloth, came and cut down this tree and took it away, to the great grief
of everyone. Not long afterwards the same savage-looking man came back
and set it up as it was before.

<span id="page_474">p. 474</span>

   When the King awoke he related his dream, and felt sure that it
related to Vidhûra; for none other than Vidhûra could be like unto this
tree, for his wisdom resembled the roots, his religious duties the
branches, and his preaching the sweet fruit. He felt sure, therefore,
that Vidhûra was about to be restored to him, and was joyful. He
therefore ordered the city to be decorated, the court to be prepared,
and all the princes and nobles to be assembled.

   So when Pu.n.naka set Vidhûra down in the law-court, and went off
with Irandhatî to "Catumahârâj," the King was overcome with delight;
and, rising from his seat, took him by the arm and led him to the throne
that had been prepared opposite to him, and thus addressed him:
"Vidhûra, you have come back to rejoice my heart as a chariot that has
been repaired after it has been broken. How did you escape from the
hands of the youth who took you away?"

   Vidhûra then related (in verse) all that had befallen him, and at the
conclusion said:--"Thus, O King, because Pu.n.naka had set his
affections on Irandhatî he carried me off to slay me; but obtained his
desire only by placing full reliance on me. The King of the Nâgas, and
his queen Vimalâ, too, by obtaining my heart, which is 'true wisdom,'
were satisfied. In gratitude the Nâga king restored me to my home and
country, and I obtained the wonderful ruby which may be worn by
Cakkavatti monarchs alone; I now present it to you, my Lord."

   The King then related his dream to the assembly, released all those
who were in prison, and proclaimed a universal holiday for a month.

   After the rejoicings were over, and to the end of his life, Vidhûra
instructed the King and his people with discourses in almsgiving and
religious duties, and when he died passed to Tâvatimsa. All those who
were confirmed in the law went to the land of the Devas.

   At the end of the Jâtaka the Buddha summed up as follows: "The then
king and queen are now my royal <span id="page_475">p. 475</span>
parents, the heads of the Sâki race; Vidhûra's wife, Anu.lâ, is now
Râhulâ's mother; Varu.na the Nâga king is now my disciple Sâriputtarâ,
the son of the Brâhmani Rûpa,<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>
of the village of Upatissa; the Ga.luna (Garu.la) king is now Moggalâno,
my second disciple, the son of the Brâhmani Moggali, of the village of
Kolita; Sakko is now my uncle Dododhana's son, Anuruddha; King Korabya
is now Ânandâ; Pu.n.naka is now Angulimâla, the son of the Brahman
Bhattagga, the chief teacher of Kosala, king of Sâvutthi; the horse
Manomaya is my horse Ka.n.daka; Queen Vimalâ is now Khemâ, the nun, who
was the queen of Bimbisâra, king of Râjagriha (see R.A.S. Journal, July
1893, p. 529); Irandhatî is now Kisagotamî; and Vidhûra is now I, the
Buddha."

<span class="small">\[1. Both Rûpa and Moggali are here called
