<td><p>BOOK VII.</p>
ONCE upon earth there lived a saintly king<br />
Named Harišchandra; pure in heart and mind,<br />
In virtue eminent, he ruled the world,<br />
Guarding mankind from evil. While he reigned<br />
No famine raged, nor pain; untimely death<br />
Ne'er cut men off; nor were the citizens<br />
Of his fair city lawless. All their wealth,<br />
And power, and works of righteousness, ne'er filled<br />
Their hearts with pride; in everlasting youth<br />
And loveliness the women passed their days.<br />
   It so fell out, that while this mighty king<br />
Was hunting in the forest, that he heard<br />
The sound of female voices raised in cry<br />
Of supplication. Then he turned and said,<br />
Leaving the deer to fly unheeded: "Stop!<br />
Who art thou, full of tyranny and hate,<br />
That darest thus oppress the earth; while I,<br />
The tamer of all evil, live and rule?"<br />
Then, too, the fierce Ganeša,--he who blinds<br />
The eyes, and foils the wills of men,--he heard<br />
The cry, and thus within himself he thought:<br />
"This surely is the great ascetic's work,<br />
The mighty Višvâmitra; he whose acts<br />
Display the fruits of penance hard and sore.<br />
Upon the sciences he shows his power,<br />
While they, in patience, discipline of mind,<br />
And silence perfected, cry out with fear,<br />
'What shall we do? The illustrious Kaušika<br />
Is powerful; and we, compared with him,<br />
<span id="page_356">p. 356</span> Are feeble.' Thus they cry. What shall I do?<br />
My mind is filled with doubt. Yet stay; a thought<br />
Has come across me: Lo! this king who cries<br />
Unceasingly, 'Fear not!' meeting with him,<br />
And entering his heart, I will fulfil<br />
All my desire." Then filled with Rudra's son--<br />
Inspired with rage by Vigna Raj--the king<br />
Spake up and said: "What evil doer is here,<br />
Binding the fire on his garment's hem,<br />
While I, his king, in power and arms renowned,<br />
Resplendent in my glory, pass for nought?<br />
Surely the never-ending sleep of death<br />
Shall overtake him, and his limbs shall fail,<br />
Smitten with darts from my far-reaching bow,<br />
Whose fame this lower world may scarce contain."<br />
Hearing the prince's words, the saint was filled<br />
With wrath o'erpow'ring, and the sciences<br />
Fell blasted in a moment at his glance.<br />
   But when the king beheld the pious sage<br />
All-powerful, he quaked exceedingly,<br />
And trembled like the sacred fig-tree's leaves.<br />
Then Višvâmitra cried: "Stop, miscreant!"<br />
And Harišchandra, humbly falling down<br />
Before the saint, in accents low and meek:<br />
"O Lord! most holy! most adorable!<br />
Oh, blame me not! This is no fault of mine!<br />
My duty calls," he said, "I must obey."<br />
"Is it not written in the Holy Law,<br />
'Alms must be given by a virtuous king;<br />
His people must be fought for, and be kept<br />
From every ill'?" Then Višvâmitra spoke<br />
And said: "To whom, O king, should'st thou give alms?<br />
For whom in battle should'st thou fight? and whom<br />
Should'st thou protect? Oh, tell me, nor delay,<br />
But quickly answer, if thou fearest sin."<br />
"Alms should be given to Brâhmans," said the king:<br />
"Those who are weak should be protected: foes<br />
In battle should be met and overcome."<br />
<span id="page_357">p. 357</span><br />
   Then Višvâmitra spoke and said: "O king!<br />
If thus indeed thou rightly dost perceive<br />
Thy royal duty, give thine alms to me;<br />
I am a holy Brâhman, and I seek<br />
A dwelling-place; moreover I would gain<br />
A wife: therefore bestow on me thine alms."<br />
The king, his heart filled with exceeding joy,<br />
Felt, as it were, his youth return, and said:<br />
"Fear not! but tell me, son of Kaušika,<br />
Thy heart's desire; and be it hard to gain,<br />
Or be it easy, it shall still be thine.<br />
Say, shall I give thee gold, or wealth, or life?<br />
Or shall I give thee wife, or child, or land?<br />
Or my prosperity itself?" "O king!"<br />
The sage replied, "thy present I accept;<br />
But let thine alms, I pray, be granted first,--<br />
The offering for the kingly sacrifice."<br />
"O Brâhman!" said the king, "the alms are thine;<br />
Further than this, whatever be the gift<br />
Thou mayest desire, freely I give it thee.<br />
Ask what thou wilt." Then Višvâmitra spake:<br />
"Give me the earth, its mountains, seas, and towns,<br />
With all its kingdoms, chariots, horses, men;<br />
Its elephants, its treasure-houses too;<br />
Its treasures vast, and all whate'er beside<br />
Is recognized as thine: oh! give me all,<br />
I pray, except thyself, thy wife, thy son,<br />
And this thy righteousness, that follows close<br />
Beside thee. Sinless one! oh thou who art<br />
Perfect in righteousness! oh give me all--<br />
All beside these. What need of further words."<br />
   The king, with heart rejoicing, and unchanged<br />
In countenance, hearing the sage's words,<br />
Said, humbly bowing down before the saint,<br />
"So be thy wish fulfilled." "O saintly king,"<br />
Said Višvâmitra, "if the world is mine,<br />
And power, and wealth, I pray you who shall reign,<br />
Since in this kingdom as a devotee<br />
<span id="page_358">p. 358</span> I dwell?" Then Harišchandra said: "'Ere this,<br />
Before the world was thine by my free gift,<br />
Thou wast the lord of all; how much more now?<br />
Thy right is doubly sure." Then said the sage:<br />
"If this indeed be so,--if the whole world<br />
Be truly mine, and all its sovereignty,<br />
Then should'st thou not remain, nor leave thyself<br />
Aught of that kingdom which thou hast renounced,<br />
But, casting off thy royal ornaments,<br />
Thou should'st depart, clothed in a dress of bark."<br />
The king, obedient to the sage's word,<br />
Stripped off his royal dress, and, with his wife<br />
And son, made haste to go. Then said the saint:<br />
"Stop, Harišchandra! Hast thou then forgot<br />
The offering for the kingly sacrifice<br />
That thou hast promised us?" Replied the king:<br />
"O mighty saint! the kingdom now is <em>thine</em>;<br />
All have I given to <em>thee</em>: and as for me,<br />
What have I left?--nought! save myself,<br />
My wife, my son!" "Thou sayest the truth, indeed,"<br />
Answered the sage; "but yet there still remains<br />
The offering for the kingly sacrifice.<br />
And this know well: A vow to Brâhmans made,<br />
If unfulfilled, works special woe to him<br />
Who made the vow. For in this sacrifice<br />
Must offerings of worth be freely made<br />
To Brâhmans;--offerings until they cry<br />
Hold! that suffices for us! Therefore pay<br />
Thy promised vow, nor longer hesitate.<br />
'Alms are for Brâhmans,' thou thyself hast said,<br />
'Those who are weak must be protected: foes<br />
In battle must be met and overcome.'"<br />
"O saintly priest!" answered the king, "my wealth<br />
Is all departed: nothing now remains<br />
For me to give: yet grant me time I pray,<br />
And I will pay the offering!" "Noble king,"<br />
Said Višvâmitra, "speak I pray thee! Say<br />
What time dost thou appoint that I should wait?<br />
<span id="page_359">p. 359</span> Speak! no delay! or else my curse of fire<br />
Shall burn thee up." Then Harišchandra said:<br />
"Most holy Brâhman! when a month has past<br />
The money for the offering shall be thine.<br />
Now I have nothing. Oh! be pleased to grant<br />
Remission for the present." Said the sage,<br />
"Go! go! most noble prince! maintain thy faith!<br />
And may'st thou prosper! may no enemies<br />
Harass thy road." Commanded thus, the king<br />
Departed as an outcast;--he, the king<br />
Of all the earth, an exile with his wife<br />
Unused to go afoot, and with his son<br />
Went forth: while cries and lamentations rose<br />
On every side: "Our hearts are filled with pain,<br />
Why dost thou leave us thus? O virtuous king!<br />
Show mercy to thy subjects. Righteousness<br />
Indeed shines forth in thee; if thou art full<br />
Of mercy, may it overflow on us.<br />
Stay! Mighty Prince! one moment, while we gaze<br />
With lover's eyes upon thy beauteous form.<br />
Alas! our Prince! Shall we ne'er see thee more?<br />
How changed thy princely state! Thou, who did'st once<br />
Go forth, surrounded by attendant kings,<br />
Who marched on foot; while stately elephants<br />
Bore e'en thy ministers. Now, Lord of Kings!<br />
Thyself art driven forth on foot. Yet, stay!<br />
Think, Harišchandra! how wilt thou endure<br />
The dust, the heat, the toil? Stay, mighty prince,<br />
Nor cast thy duty off. Oh, show to us<br />
Some mercy, for herein thy duty lies.<br />
Behold, we cast off all for thee! Our wives,<br />
Our wealth, our children, our possessions, all<br />
Have we relinquished; like thy shadow,<br />
We would follow thee. Oh leave us not!<br />
For wheresoe'er thou art is happiness,<br />
And heaven itself would be no heaven to us<br />
Without our prince." Then, overwhelmed with grief<br />
At these laments, the king stayed on his course,<br />
<span id="page_360">p. 360</span> In pity for his loving citizens.<br />
Then Višvâmitra, filled with rage, his eyes<br />
Rolling with wrath, exclaimed: "Shame on thee! shame!<br />
O full of falsehood, and of wickedness.<br />
How! would'st thou, then, speaker of lies!<br />
Resume the gifts that thou hast freely made,<br />
And reinstate thee in thy kingdom?" "Sir!<br />
I go!" replied the king to these rude words,<br />
And trembling crept away in haste, his wife<br />
Holding him by the hand. And, as she went,<br />
Her fragile form o'ercome with weariness,<br />
The Brâhman smote her fiercely with his stick.<br />
Then Harišchandra, pained with inmost grief,<br />
Seeing the stroke, said meekly, "Sir! I go!"<br />
Nor further spoke. Filled with compassion then,<br />
The Višvadevas said: "What sin is this?<br />
What torments shall indeed suffice for him<br />
By whom this pious king--the offerer<br />
Of prayer, and sacrifice, has been cast forth.<br />
Who now will sanctify the Soma-juice<br />
With prayers and hymns, at the great sacrifice,<br />
That we may drink it with rejoicing hearts?"<br />
   Then, having heard these words, the Brâhman turned<br />
Upon the Višvedevâs; and, in wrath<br />
Exceeding hot, he spake a fearful curse:<br />
"You shall be cast down from the height of heaven,<br />
And live as men." The curse had hardly passed<br />
His lips, when filled with pity for their fate,<br />
The sage yet further added: "you shall live<br />
Indeed as men, but yet, there shall be born<br />
To you no son, nor shall you know the state<br />
Of marriage. Envy, love, and wrath shall ne'er<br />
Hold sway o'er you: and when the appointed time<br />
Has past, you shall re-enter once again<br />
The courts of heaven, and wear again the form<br />
Which you had lost." The Višvedevâs then<br />
Came down from heaven, and, clothed in human form,<br />
Were born as men, the sons of Pritha, wife<br />
<span id="page_361">p. 361</span> Of Pa.n.du. Therefore those five Pâ.n.davas--<br />
Mighty in war--by Višvâmitra cursed,<br />
Knew not the state of marriage. Thou hast heard<br />
The tale of Pa.n.du's sons; thy question, too,<br />
Of fourfold import has been answered.<br />
I pray thee, say, what further would'st thou hear?<br />
 <br />

<p>BOOK VIII.</p>
Said Jaimîni: An answer ye have found<br />
To all my questions; and indeed have filled<br />
Me full of deepest interest. Oh! I long<br />
To hear yet more! Alas! that saintly king!<br />
What grief he suffered! Did he e'er attain<br />
To any comfort answering to his woe?<br />
Noblest of Birds! Oh tell me this, I pray.<br />
   The Holy Birds continued: Then the king,<br />
O'ercome with grief and pain, hearing the words<br />
Of Višvâmitra, with his wife and son<br />
Journeyed along, dragging his weary steps.<br />
At length the holy place appeared in view--<br />
The shrine of Šiva; thus within himself,<br />
He said: "Benares, sacred to the god,<br />
Lies now before me; there shall I find rest,<br />
For there man has no power." The king approached<br />
The gates on foot: lo! at the entry stood<br />
The Brâhman Višvâmitra. Mighty Saint!<br />
The king, his hands in supplication joined,<br />
With humble reverence, said: "Here is my life,<br />
My wife, my son, I offer all to thee;<br />
Accept, I pray, the offering! or choose<br />
Whatever else thou wouldest!" But the sage<br />
Replied: "The month is past! most saintly king!<br />
Give me the present for the sacrifice--<br />
<span id="page_362">p. 362</span> The offering thou hast promised." "One half-day<br />
As yet remains before the month be past,<br />
Oh Brâhman of surpassing piety,<br />
And penances unfading. Wait, I pray,<br />
A few short hours." Then Višvâmitra said:<br />
"So be it, king! once more I will return,<br />
But if the offering be not duly paid,<br />
Before the sinking of this evening's sun,<br />
My curse shall smite thee." And the priest<br />
Departed, while the king, in anxious thought,<br />
Debated thus: "How shall I make the gift?<br />
The promised gift? where are my friends? my wealth?<br />
I may not beg for alms; how can I then<br />
Fulfil my vow? Nor even in the world<br />
Beyond shall I find rest. Destruction waits,<br />
If with my promise unfulfilled, I pass<br />
From hence. A robber of the holy saints;<br />
I shall become the lowest of the low.<br />
Nay, I will sell myself! and, as a slave,<br />
Redeem my promise." Then the queen, in tears<br />
Bewildered, and afflicted, lost in thought,<br />
With face cast down, "Maintain thy truth," she said,<br />
"Most mighty prince! Oh! let not doubt prevail!<br />
The man devoid of truth is to be shunned<br />
Like contact with the dead. The highest law<br />
Declares, that inward truth and faithfulness<br />
Must be maintained. Burnt sacrifices, alms,<br />
The study of the scriptures, penances,<br />
Are counted not for righteousness to him<br />
Whose word is faithless. Listen! noble prince!<br />
Is it not written in the sacred law:<br />
'The wise attain Salvation through the truth,<br />
While lies and falsehood are destruction's way<br />
To men of low and evil minds.' There lived,<br />
'Tis said, a king upon the earth, by whom<br />
The kingly sacrifice--burnt offerings too,<br />
Were offered in abundance. That same king<br />
Fell once from truthfulness, and by that fall,<br />
<span id="page_363">p. 363</span> He lost his righteousness, and forfeited<br />
His place in heaven. Prince! I have borne a son"--<br />
Her utterance failed her, issuing forth in nought<br />
But sighs and lamentations. Then the king,<br />
With eyes o'erflowing, said, "Behold thy son!<br />
He stands beside thee! cast away thy grief!<br />
Tell me what presses on thee." Said the queen,<br />
"Prince, I have borne a son; and sons are born<br />
To none but worthy women. This my son<br />
Shall take me--he shall offer me for sale--<br />
Then with the money gained, pay thou the priest<br />
The promised offering." Hearing these words,<br />
He fell down fainting. When his sense returned,<br />
Filled with exceeding pain, the king burst forth,<br />
Lamenting: "This, alas! most loving one!<br />
Is hardly to be framed in words, much less<br />
Be carried out in deed. Alas! alas!"--<br />
His spirit fled again, and to the earth<br />
He fell unconscious. Overcome with grief,<br />
The queen exclaimed, filled with compassion: "King!<br />
How art thou fallen from thy high estate!<br />
The ground is now thy resting-place, whom once<br />
A gorgeous couch received. Lo! this my lord,<br />
By whom wealth, honour, power, are freely given<br />
An offering to the Brâhman--see, he lies<br />
Insensate on the ground. Ye gods of heaven!<br />
Tell me, I pray you, has this noble king,<br />
Equal to gods in rank, committed sin<br />
Against you, that he lies thus overcome<br />
With woe?" Then fell the queen, bereft of sense<br />
Upon the earth, o'erwhelmed with grief and pain,<br />
Seeing her husband's misery. When the boy<br />
Beheld his parents lying on the ground,<br />
He cried in terror: "Father! give me food!<br />
Mother! my tongue is parched with thirst!" Meanwhile<br />
Upon the scene the mighty Brâhman came;<br />
And when he saw the king lie senseless, "King!"--<br />
Sprinkling cold water on his face--he said,<br />
<span id="page_364">p. 364</span> "Rise up! rise up! Pay me the promised vow;<br />
For this thy misery from day to day<br />
Increases, and will yet increase, until<br />
The debt be paid." The water's cooling touch<br />
Refreshed the king; his consciousness returned;<br />
But when he saw the Brâhman, faintness seized<br />
His limbs again. Then overpowering rage<br />
Seized Višvâmitra; but before he left,<br />
The best of Brâhmans said: "If what is just,<br />
Or right, or true, enters thy mind, O king!<br />
Give me the present. Lo! by truth divine<br />
The sun sends forth his vivifying rays<br />
Upon the earth. By truth this mighty world<br />
Stands firm and steadfast. Truth all law excels.<br />
By truth the very heaven itself exists.<br />
Wert thou to weigh the truth, and in the scale<br />
Opposing, wert to place burnt-offerings,<br />
And sacrifices countless, still the truth<br />
Would far outweigh them all. Why need I waste<br />
My words of loving-kindness upon thee--<br />
An ill-intentioned, false, ignoble man.<br />
Thou art a king,--so should the truth prevail<br />
With thee. Yet hear me;--if the offering<br />
Be still unpaid when th' evening's sun has sunk<br />
Behind the western mountain to his rest,<br />
My curse shall smite thee." Speaking words like these<br />
The Brâhman left him; and the king, o'ercome<br />
With fear--a fugitive--robbed of his wealth--<br />
Degraded to unfathomable depths--<br />
The victim of his evil creditor--<br />
Heard once again the counsel of his wife:<br />
"O king! sell <em>me</em>! nor let the fiery curse<br />
Dissolve thy being!" Urged repeatedly,<br />
The king at length replied: "Most loving one!<br />
What the most wicked man could hardly do,<br />
That same will I:--and I will sell my wife.<br />
Alas! that I should utter such a word!"<br />
And going with his wife into the town--<br />
<span id="page_365">p. 365</span> Eyes dimmed with tears, voice choked with grief--he cried:<br />
"Come hither, townsmen! hearken unto me!<br />
A wretch! inhuman! savage as a fiend!<br />
I offer here my wife for sale, and yet<br />
I live! Here is a female slave! Who buys?<br />
Make haste and speak." "The female slave is mine!"<br />
(So spake an ancient Brâhman to the king.)<br />
"Money I have in heaps, and I will pay<br />
You well for her. My wife is delicate;<br />
Her household duties are beyond her strength;<br />
I want a slave, and therefore I will give<br />
A price proportioned to the woman's skill<br />
And temper; nor will I o'erlook her youth<br />
And beauty. What you think is fair and right,<br />
That will I pay." Struck dumb with grief, the king<br />
Stood mute, nor answered aught. And then the priest,<br />
Tying the price in the king's garment-hem--<br />
His bark-cloth garment--roughly grasped the queen,<br />
And dragged her off. But when the loving child<br />
Beheld his mother led away, he seized<br />
Her by her garment. And the queen exclaimed:<br />
"If only for a moment, noble sir!<br />
Oh! let me go! that I may gaze once more<br />
Upon my child, whom I shall never see,<br />
And never touch again! My child, behold<br />
Thy mother, now a slave! And thou--a prince!<br />
Oh, touch me not! My lot of servitude<br />
Forbids that thou should'st touch me." But the child,<br />
His eyes bedewed with tears, ran after her,<br />
Calling her "Mother!" As the boy came near,<br />
The Brâhman spurned him with his foot; but he<br />
Still following close would not be torn from her,<br />
Calling her "Mother!" "Oh, my lord! I pray,<br />
Be gracious to me!" said the queen. "Oh, buy<br />
My son with me; divide us not! For I<br />
Without him shall be nought of use to you.<br />
Be gracious, O my lord!" Then said the priest:<br />
<span id="page_366">p. 366</span> "Here! take the money! give the boy to me!<br />
The saints, who know the scriptures, have ordained<br />
The right and lawful sum. Take it!" He tied<br />
The money in the king's bark dress, and led<br />
Them both away--the mother and the child--<br />
Together bound. But when the king beheld<br />
Himself bereft of both his wife and son,<br />
He burst forth: "Ah! my wife! whom neither sun,<br />
Nor moon, nor air have ever seen I who hast<br />
Been kept from vulgar gaze! Alas I a slave<br />
Hast thou become! Alas! thou, too, my son!--<br />
A scion of the noble dynasty,<br />
Sprung from the sun! disgrace has seized on thee,<br />
And--shame upon me!--thou too art a slave!<br />
Ye have become a sacrifice; ye, through my fault,<br />
Have fallen. Would that I were dead!" Thus spoke<br />
The king. Meanwhile the Brâhman hastily<br />
Entered the grove wherein his dwelling stood,<br />
And vanished with his slaves. Then met the king<br />
The Brâhman Višvâmitra. "Prince!" he said,<br />
Pay me the offering!" Harišchandra gave<br />
The money gainèd by the shameful sale<br />
Of wife and child. And when the priest beheld<br />
The money, overcome with wrath, he said:<br />
"How canst thou mock me with this paltry sum!<br />
Base Kshatriya! And thinkest thou that this<br />
Suffices for a sacrificial gift<br />
Such as I would accept? But if thy mind<br />
Thus far misleads thee, thou shalt feel my power--<br />
Power transcendant, gained by penances,<br />
And scripture meditation. Yes! the power<br />
Of my pure Brâhmanhood shall show itself<br />
On thee." "More will I give thee," said the king,<br />
"But wait, most noble saint! Nought have I left!<br />
Even my wife and child are sold." Replied<br />
The Brâhman: "Hold! be silent! Further time<br />
Than the remaining fourth part of to-day<br />
I grant thee not." Enraged, he turned away,<br />
<span id="page_367">p. 367</span> Departing with the money. And the king,<br />
Immersed in grief and fear, with face cast down,<br />
Cried out: "If there be any one of you<br />
Who wants a slave, let him make haste and speak<br />
While day remains." Then Dharma, putting on<br />
The form of a Cha.n.dâla, hastily<br />
Came forward, taking pity on the king.<br />
His countenance was fearful,--black, with tusks<br />
Projecting; savage in his words; his smell<br />
Was foul and horrible; a crowd of dogs<br />
Came after him. "Tell me thy price," he said;<br />
"Be quick; and whether it be large or small<br />
I care not, so I have thee as my slave:"<br />
The king, beholding such a loathsome form,<br />
Of mien revolting--"What art thou?" he said.<br />
"Men call me a Cha.n.dâla," he replied.<br />
I dwell in this same city--in a part<br />
Of evil fame. As of a murderer<br />
Condemned to death, such is my infamy.<br />
My calling is a robber of the dead."<br />
"I will not be a slave," exclaimed the king,<br />
"To thee, a base Cha.n.dâla. Better far<br />
That I should perish by the fiery curse."<br />
The words were scarcely uttered, when the saint<br />
Returned, his countenance with rage<br />
Distorted; and he thus addressed the king:<br />
"The sum is fair; why dost thou not accept<br />
The offer? Then indeed thou mightest pay<br />
The gift thou owest for the sacrifice."<br />
"O son of Kušika!" replied the king,<br />
"Consider this, I pray!--my noble race!<br />
Truly am I descended from the sun!<br />
How can I then become, though sore in want,<br />
Lowest of creatures--a Cha.n.dâla's slave?"<br />
"Delay no more," the Brâhman said, "but pay<br />
The gift at once, and sell thyself a slave<br />
To the Cha.n.dâla--or assuredly<br />
I curse thee." "Saintly priest, be merciful!"<br />
<span id="page_368">p. 368</span> The king entreated; and, immersed in care,<br />
He seized the Brâhman's feet, exclaiming thus:<br />
"What am I but a slave, o'erwhelmed with grief!<br />
Fear holds me! Saintly priest, be merciful!<br />
Protect me, mighty saint! Save me, I pray,<br />
From this most horrible Cha.n.dâla. Sir!<br />
Most noble saint! hereafter shall thy will<br />
Be all the object of my life! To serve<br />
Thy lightest wish shall be my highest joy!<br />
Thus will I make the offering--I will be<br />
Thy <em>slave</em>!" Replied the Brahman: "If thou art<br />
My slave, then will I sell thee as a slave<br />
To the Cha.n.dâla." Then, filled with delight,<br />
Paying the money, the Švapâka bound<br />
His lately-purchased slave, and striking him,<br />
Led hill away. Parted from all his friends;<br />
In utmost grief; in the Cha.n.dâla's house<br />
Abiding--morning, noon, and eventide,<br />
And night, the king thus made lament:<br />
"Alas! my tender wife, overwhelmed with pain,<br />
Looking upon her son in misery,<br />
Bewails her lot. But yet she says: 'The king<br />
Will surely ransom us, for he has gained<br />
By now more money than the Brâhman paid<br />
For us;' and all the time she little knows<br />
My fate--worse than her own. For I have passed<br />
From woe to woe--kingdom and friends--my wife,<br />
My son, have passed from me, and now the state<br />
Of a Cha.n.dâla holds me." While he dwelt<br />
A slave in the Cha.n.dâla's house, the forms<br />
Of those he loved were still before his eyes--<br />
Were ever in his mind. Meanwhile the king,<br />
Obedient to his master's will, became<br />
A robber of the dead; and night and day<br />
He watched for plunder. "One part of the spoil<br />
Is for the king, three for thy master, two<br />
For thee. Go to the city's southern part,<br />
Where is the dwelling of the dead, there wait."<br />
<span id="page_369">p. 369</span> Obeying the Cha.n.dâla, to the place<br />
Of burial he went;--an awful place,<br />
Filled full of fearful sounds and loathsome sights--<br />
Of evil smells, and smoke, and locks of hair<br />
Fallen from the dead; while troops of fiends and ghouls,<br />
Vampires and demons, wandered to and fro.<br />
Vultures and jackals prowled, and spirit forms'<br />
Of evil hovered o'er. The ground was strewn<br />
With heaps of bones; and wailing, sharp and shrill,<br />
Re-echoed from the mourners of the dead.<br />
The bodies on the funeral piles, half burnt,<br />
Crackled and hissed; showing their shining teeth,<br />
They grinned, as if in sport; while all the time<br />
The howl of demons and the wail of fiends<br />
Were mingled with the roar of flames--a sound<br />
Of fearful import, such as ushers in<br />
The day of doom. The sights, and sounds, and smells--<br />
The heaps of ashes, and the piles of bones,<br />
Blackened with filth--the smoke, the shouts,<br />
The yells--struck fear on fear into the heart.<br />
The burial-place resembled nought but hell.<br />
Such was the place appointed for the king.<br />
"Priests! Brâhmans! Counsellors! how have I fallen<br />
From all my royal state! Alas! my queen!<br />
Alas! my son! Oh! miserable fate!<br />
We have been torn asunder by the power<br />
Of Višvâmitra." Thoughts like these possessed<br />
His inmost mind; while foul, unshorn, unwashed,<br />
He served his master. Running here and there,<br />
Armed with a jagged club, he sought the dead,<br />
From whom he gained his wages. So he lived,<br />
Degraded from his caste. Old knotted rags<br />
Served as his dress; his face and arms and feet<br />
With dust and ashes from the funeral piles<br />
Begrimed; his hands defiled with putrid flesh<br />
From contact with the bodies of the dead.<br />
So neither day nor night he ceased from toil.<br />
And twelve months passed--twelve weary months, which seemed<br />
<span id="page_370">p. 370</span> To his grief-stricken mind a hundred years;<br />
And then at last, worn out, the best of kings<br />
Lay down to rest; and as upon his couch<br />
All motionless in sleep he lay, he saw<br />
A wondrous vision. By the power divine<br />
He seemed to wear another form,--a form<br />
Both new and strange,--and in that form to pay<br />
The vow. Twelve years of expiation passed<br />
With difficulty. Then within himself<br />
King Harišchandra thought: "So too will I,<br />
When I am freed from hence, perform my vows<br />
With generous freedom." Forthwith he was born<br />
As a Pukkasa; while a place was found<br />
For him among the dead, and funeral rites<br />
Were ordered as his task. Thus seven years<br />
Were passed; then to the burying-place was brought<br />
A Brâhman seeking sepulture: in life<br />
He had been poor, but honest; and the king,<br />
Though he knew this--the dead man's poverty<br />
And his uprightness--pressed his friends to pay<br />
The funeral dues. "Enforce thy right," they said,<br />
"And do this evil deed; yet know thou this:<br />
Once upon earth there was a mighty king<br />
Named Harišchandra; though he but disturbed<br />
A Brâhman's sleep, through that offence he lost<br />
His merit, and by Višvâmitra's curse<br />
Became a base Pukkasa." "Yet the king<br />
Spared not the dead man's friends, but still required<br />
His fee. Therefore they cursed him in their rage--<br />
"Go!--go!--thou most degraded of mankind--<br />
Go to the lowest hell!" Then in his dream<br />
The king beheld the messengers of death.<br />
Fearful to look at, armed with heavy chains,<br />
They seized him, and they bound him hand and foot,<br />
And bore him off. And then, in fear and pain,<br />
Headlong he fell into the bath of oil<br />
In Nâraka. There, torn with instruments<br />
Sharp-edged as razors, fed on putrid blood,<br />
<span id="page_371">p. 371</span> He saw himself. For seven years in hell--<br />
Now burnt from day to day, now tossed and torn,<br />
Now cut by knives, and now by icy winds<br />
Frozen and numbed--a dead Pukkasa's fate<br />
He underwent. Each day in Nâraka,<br />
A hundred years of mortal reckoning--<br />
So count the demons who inhabit hell.<br />
Then he beheld himself cast up to earth,<br />
His spirit entering a filthy dog;<br />
Feeding on things all foul and horrible--<br />
Consumed by cold. A month thus passed away.<br />
His spirit changed its dwelling, and he saw<br />
Himself an ass; and after that an ox,<br />
A cow, a goat, a sheep, a bird, a worm.<br />
So day by day he saw his spirit change<br />
Its outward shape. A multitude of forms--<br />
Some moving, others rooted to the ground--<br />
Received his soul. And when the hundred years<br />
Were passed and gone, he saw himself again<br />
Re-occupy his pristine human form--<br />
Once more a king. And then he seemed to lose<br />
His kingdom, casting it away in games<br />
Of chance. Turned from his home a wanderer<br />
Into the forest with his wife and child:<br />
Devoured by a ravening beast, but raised<br />
To life again on earth, he sore bewailed<br />
His wife: "Alas! why hast thou left me thus?<br />
Alas! O Saivya! where hast thou gone?"<br />
Then in his dream he seemed to see his wife<br />
And son lamenting: "What hast thou to do<br />
With gambling? Oh protect us, mighty king!"<br />
The vision faded, and he saw no more<br />
The cherished forms. And then the dream returned<br />
By power divine. And Harišchandra stood<br />
In heaven, and he beheld his wife on earth,<br />
With flowing hair, dragged forcibly along--<br />
Stripped of her clothes: the cry came to his ear,<br />
"Protect us, king of men!" Then, snatched away,<br />
<span id="page_372">p. 372</span> The demons hurried him before the judge;<br />
And Harišchandra seemed to hear the words:<br />
"Go forth! return once more to earth! Thy grief<br />
Is well nigh past and ended; joy ere long<br />
Shall come to thee. The sorrows that remain<br />
Endure." The king, then driven from the sky<br />
By Yama's messengers, falling through space--<br />
Senseless in fear and terror, filled with pain<br />
Yet more exceeding--thought within himself,<br />
"How shall I suffer all these torments sore!--<br />
The changes manifold of form--the pain<br />
In Nâraka." Then Harišchandra sought<br />
Aid from the gods: "O mighty lords," he said,<br />
"Protect me! O protect my wife and child!<br />
O mighty Dharma, thee I worship! Thee,<br />
O Krish.na, the Creator! Faultless ones,<br />
Both far and near, before you now I come,<br />
A suppliant. On thee, O lord of prayer,<br />
I call! on thee, O Indra too! to thee<br />
O ancient one! I pray--immutable!"<br />
The vision fled, the king arose from sleep.<br />
His tangled hair, his body black and grimed,<br />
Recalled to him his state--the plunderer<br />
Of dead men's clothes. His recollection gone,<br />
He thought not of his sorrowing wife and child,<br />
For reason failed. The loss of kingdom, wealth,<br />
And friends, his dwelling-place among the tombs,<br />
Had overthrown his senses, and destroyed<br />
His mind. Then to the burying-place the queen<br />
Came, bearing the dead body of her son--<br />
Pale and distracted. "My beloved son!<br />
My child!" she kept exclaiming, while she threw<br />
Dust on her head. "Alas! alas! O king!<br />
O that thou could'st behold thy child," she said--<br />
"Thy child now lying dead upon the earth,<br />
Killed by a serpent's bite. Alas! my son!<br />
So lovely! so delightful!" Then the king,<br />
Rearing the sounds of mourning, went in haste<br />
<span id="page_373">p. 373</span> To rob the dead: nor did he recognize<br />
His wife, in that sad mourner, changed by grief<br />
As if into another. And the queen<br />
Knew not the form that stood before her, clothed<br />
In rags, with matted hair, withered and foul.<br />
Then recollection dawned upon the king,<br />
Seeing the dead child's princely form, the thought<br />
Of his own son came o'er him. "Ah! my child!<br />
What evil chance," he said, "has brought thee here!<br />
A child of princely race thou seemest. He, my son,<br />
Long lost to me through my accursed fate,<br />
Would have been even such as thou in age."<br />
Then raised the queen her voice, and thus she spoke:<br />
"Alas! has some unexpiated crime<br />
Brought upon us, my child! this endless woe.<br />
My absent lord! since thou did'st not console<br />
My grief in times gone by, how can the pain<br />
I suffer now assuage? Did'st thou not lose<br />
Thy kingdom? did'st thou not desert thy friends?<br />
Did'st thou not sell thy wife and child?" The king<br />
Heard her lament, and as he heard, the wail<br />
Fell from his eyes,--he recognized again<br />
His wife and son--and saying but the words,<br />
"Ah! Saivya! Ah! my beloved child!"<br />
He fainting fell to earth. Then, too, the queen,<br />
Hearing her husband's voice, o'ercome with grief,<br />
Insensate fell. Returning consciousness<br />
Brought to them both affliction's heaviest weight<br />
And mutual lamentations. "Ah! my son!"<br />
Thus mourned the king, "my inmost heart is torn,<br />
When I behold thy form so delicate:<br />
My child! embracing thee in tend'rest love,<br />
Words of affection I will speak, that rise<br />
Unbidden to my lips. Alas! thy limbs<br />
Will be defiled by my embrace; the dust<br />
That clings about my garments will pollute<br />
Thy lovely form! Alas! my child, thou had'st<br />
An evil father! He who should have kept<br />
<span id="page_374">p. 374</span> All dangers from thee, he it was who sold<br />
Thee as a slave! and yet in heart and mind<br />
First of all things I love thee. Ah! my child!<br />
Thy father's realm--my heaped-up wealth--all this<br />
By lawful right was thine inheritance,<br />
And now thou liest slain! Ah me! the tears<br />
Rise to my eyes in blinding force: thy form,<br />
In grace and beauty like the lotus flower,<br />
Fades from my sight." He spoke, and faltering<br />
With grief embraced his son. The queen exclaimed:<br />
"This is indeed my lord--I know his voice!<br />
I know his form! this is the mighty king.<br />
The wisest of all beings. But how changed!<br />
What fate is this? Ah what a dreadful place<br />
For him, the lord of men. This grief yet more<br />
Is added to the mourning for my son--<br />
My husband's fate--for as a slave he serves<br />
A base Cha.n.dâla. Curséd be that god,<br />
Or demon foul, through whom a godlike king<br />
Has fallen to this degraded state; the lot<br />
Of a Švapâka. Ah! most noble prince,<br />
My mind is filled with grief, when I recall<br />
Thy regal state, thy past magnificence.<br />
No kingly ensigns go before thee now,<br />
No captive kings, brought down to slavery,<br />
Humbly precede thee, casting in the way<br />
Their garments, lest the dust should soil thy feet.<br />
But now! O king! alas, thyself a slave,<br />
Thou livest in this fearful place, begrimed<br />
With filth; thy sacred cord concealed, thy hair<br />
Tangled and long, plunder of dead men's clothes<br />
Thy livelihood. Ah! king! and is thy life<br />
Spent in this awful wise?" So spake the queen,<br />
And falling on his neck, embraced her lord:<br />
While she, sprung from a king herself, bewailed<br />
Her sorrows endless. "King! I pray thee speak!<br />
Is this a dream? If it be real and true,<br />
Then justice, truth, and righteousness have fled<br />
<span id="page_375">p. 375</span> And gone from earth: nor aught avails mankind,<br />
Of sacrifice, or reverence, to gods<br />
Or priests! 'Tis vain to follow innocence<br />
If thou, most perfect, purest of mankind,<br />
Art brought to such a depth of infamy."<br />
Then spoke the king, and told his sorrowing wife<br />
How he had fallen to this wretched state,--<br />
The state of a Cha.n.dâla. She, in turn,<br />
Weeping, with many sighs, poured out her tale,<br />
Telling him how the serpent's bite had killed<br />
Their child. "Beloved one! I suffer not<br />
These evils," said the king, "by mine own will--<br />
Thou seest what I endure; my evil fate<br />
Depends not on myself. I am a slave,<br />
And if I fly from the Cha.n.dâla's bonds,<br />
The fiery torment in the depths of hell<br />
Will overtake me, and I shall become<br />
A slave again. My doom is fixed! lo! hell<br />
Is my abode hereafter; and in forms,<br />
Creeping and loathsome, shall my soul abide.<br />
Yet from this miserable life on earth<br />
There is one only refuge. He! my son!<br />
My hope! my stay! is dead; drowned by the sea<br />
Of my misfortunes. But I am a slave!<br />
I am dependent on another's will!<br />
Can I give up my wife? Yes! even so!<br />
For know thou this: one who is steeped in woe<br />
Cares not for evil chances; not the state<br />
Of the most loathsome beast, nor yet the wood<br />
Of sword-leaved plants, nor even hell's dread stream,<br />
Could add the smallest fraction to the pain<br />
I have already borne. My son is dead!<br />
Who then will make atonement for my sins?<br />
Yet listen to my words, beloved one,<br />
If I have offered sacrifice, and paid<br />
Due reverence to the saints; if I have given<br />
Alms to the needy--may we meet again<br />
Hereafter, in the world to come, and find<br />
<span id="page_376">p. 376</span> The refuge for our woes denied us here.<br />
Let us together follow in the path<br />
By which our son has gone. Our hopeless fate<br />
Can never alter here. Whatever words<br />
I may have uttered, thoughtlessly, in jest,<br />
These, when I pray for pardon, shall receive<br />
Fullest forgiveness. Thou must not despise<br />
Thy lord: nor pride thee on thy queenly state<br />
Now passed and gone." The prince's wife replied:<br />
"I am prepared to tread that path with thee,<br />
O king, most saintly! and with thee that world<br />
To enter." While she spoke these words, the king<br />
Made up the funeral pile, and placed thereon<br />
His son, himself ascending with his wife.<br />
And then, in meditation wrapt, he thought<br />
Upon Nârâyana, the lord supreme,<br />
And Vâsudeva, lord of deities,<br />
Šiva, and Brâhma the eternal god,<br />
And Krish.na clothed in glory. As the king<br />
Was meditating, all the gods from heaven<br />
Came down headed by Dharma. And they said:<br />
"Hear us, O king! hear us, O lord! The gods--<br />
Even the mighty gods have come to earth,<br />
And at their head is Dharma. Gods, and saints,<br />
And heroes--yea, and Višvâmitra too,<br />
The sage implacable,--all summon thee--<br />
Ascend! to heaven: receive the due reward,<br />
That thou hast gained. O king! slay not thyself!<br />
I, perfect Righteousness, I summon thee<br />
To enter now the heaven that thou hast gained<br />
By thy transcendant virtues, self-control,<br />
Patience, and truth." Then Indra spoke, and said:--<br />
"O Harišchandra! King, most eminent!<br />
In virtue! lo! before you Indra stands--<br />
For I am he. The everlasting world<br />
Thou hast attained: together with thy wife,<br />
And son, ascend to heaven;--to that third heav'n--<br />
So difficult to be attained by men--<br />
<span id="page_377">p. 377</span> The heav'n that thou hast won." Then Indra rained<br />
Life-giving am.rit from the sky, and flowers<br />
That blossomed in the heavenly courts: while sounds<br />
Of music filled the air, and round him stood<br />
The gods, a vast assembly. Then the son<br />
Of Harišchandra rose, restored to life,<br />
And health, his mind and senses whole, his form<br />
More beautiful than ever: and the king<br />
Embraced his wife and son, with perfect joy<br />
Filled to o'erflowing, crowned with heavenly wreaths.<br />
Then Indra said: "Thou, with thy wife, and son,<br />
Shalt dwell in bliss supreme: bliss that thyself<br />
Hast purchased, by thy virtues and thy toils."<br />
Then spoke the king: "Hear me! most holy gods!<br />
Unbidden by my master, will I not<br />
To heaven itself ascend." Then Dharma spoke:<br />
"I am thy master. I assumed the form<br />
Of a Cha.n.dâla. All thy pain and woe<br />
Was brought upon thee by my magic power,<br />
And thou wast made a slave! I have beheld<br />
Thy truth, and thy uprightness. Saintly king!<br />
The highest place that heaven accords to men,<br />
Whose virtue has been tried and proved:--to that<br />
Ascend!" But Harišchandra answering, said:<br />
"Receive, most mighty lord! my words of praise<br />
And thanksgiving. I offer them to thee<br />
Full of affection. Lo! my people stand<br />
With grieving hearts, longing for my return.<br />
Can I ascend to heav'n while they on earth<br />
Lament for me? If they have ever slain,<br />
Brâhmans, or teachers of the holy law,--<br />
If lust or avarice have ruled their hearts,--<br />
Then may my labours and my toils atone,<br />
For these their sins. I may not leave my friends.<br />
For neither here, nor in the world to come,<br />
Can there be peace to one who casts aside<br />
The friend whose love is pure and true--the friend<br />
Who serves him from the heart. Return!<br />
<span id="page_378">p. 378</span> Return! to heaven! O Indra! If thou grant<br />
My friends to rise with me, to heav'n will I<br />
Ascend; if not, with them will I descend<br />
To Nâraka." "O king! thy prayer is heard!<br />
Thy people's sins are pardoned: even for them,<br />
Hard though it be, thy toils and pains have gained<br />
A place in heaven." Thus mighty Indra spoke.<br />
Replied the king: "Indra! I will not leave<br />
My kinsmen. By his kinsmen's help a king<br />
His kingdom rules; by them he offers up<br />
The kingly sacrifice, and for himself<br />
Lays up a store of meritorious deeds.<br />
So have my kinsmen too enabled me<br />
To work whate'er I may of righteousness.<br />
My actions virtuous, my granted prayers,<br />
Truly I owe to them, for by their aid<br />
Have these been possible. May the reward<br />
Thou grantest me, I pray, be shared with them.<br />
My kinsmen, though I should ascend to heaven,<br />
I will not leave." "So be it!" Indra said;<br />
"So be it!" said the Brâhman; Dharma, too,<br />
Gave his assent; and then, in countless hosts,<br />
Appeared the heavenly chariots. Indra said:<br />
"Men of Ayodhya, ascend to heaven."<br />
The saintly Brâhman, having heard with joy<br />
The words of Indra, poured the sacred oil<br />
Upon the prince, and with the perfect ones,<br />
The sages, and the gods, anointed him<br />
"Son of the mighty king." Then all the throng--<br />
The king, his wife, his son, his followers--<br />
Filled with rejoicing and delight, ascend<br />
To heaven, surrounding, as they go, the king<br />
Borne in his chariot. He, too, filled with joy--<br />
The mighty father, who eternal bliss<br />
Both for his people and himself had gained,<br />
Once more in form and mien a king--reposed,<br />
Resting from all his toils, his faithful friends<br />
Surrounding him with a protecting wall.<br />
<span id="page_379">p. 379</span> And Indra spoke and said: "Upon this earth<br />
Great Harišchandra's equal has not been<br />
Nor shall be. Whosoe'er may hear his life,<br />
His toils, his sorrows, and in sympathy<br />
For him lament, transcendant happiness<br />
Shall he attain, and all his heart's desire<br />
Shall be accomplished. Is his prayer a wife,<br />
Or son, or kingdom, he shall gain them all,<br />
E'en heaven itself. And he who imitates<br />
The truth, and steadfastness, of that great king,<br />
Like him shall enter everlasting rest.<br />
