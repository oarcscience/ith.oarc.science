<BLOCKQUOTE>ART. XI.--<I>Vidh&ucirc;ra J&acirc;taka</I>. (No. 548 of Ceylon List.) [From the Burmese.] By R. F. ST. ANDREW ST. JOHN, M.R.A.S.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ONE day, when the disciples were discussing the various forms of wisdom peculiar to the Buddha, the Lord came into the hall and inquired what they were discussing. On being informed, he said: "Rabans, there will be no difficulty in understanding how I can now so easily overcome the opinions of Brahmans, princes, and others, bringing them to a right frame of mind, when you hear how, in a former existence as the high-born Vidh&ucirc;ra, on the summit of Mount K&acirc;.l&acirc;giri, I overcame and subdued the virulence of the Rakshasa Pu.n.naka." He then related as follows:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ago, in Kururajja"m, in the city of Indapattanagara"m, there reigned a king whose name was Dhana&ntilde;caya Korabya, whose prime minister, Vidh&ucirc;ra, expounded the law so well and sweetly that everyone was attracted to him, and all the rulers of Jambudv&icirc;pa came to get his decisions. Now in the city of B&acirc;r&acirc;nasi there were four rich Brahmans who were friends, and they, having determined to renounce the lusts of this world, went into Himavanta. Having dwelt there some time as hermits, they came into the inbabited country in search of salt and pickles, and at last arrived at Camp&acirc;nagara"m, in the country of A"nga, and dwelt in the king's garden. The rich people of the city, seeing that their deportment was correct, undertook their maintenance, and begged them to remain. One of these hermits, in a state of ecstatic meditation, used to go daily to the country of the N&acirc;gas, another to T&acirc;vatisma, another to the country of the Ga.lunas, and the fourth to the park called Mig&acirc;jina, which belonged to King Dhana&ntilde;caya Korabya, at Indapattanagara"m. On

returning, each praised the delights of these places to his particular supporters, so that each desired, when the time of change came, to go to these places.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they at length died, by reason of the good works they had performed, one became Sakko, another became king of the N&acirc;gas, another became king of the Ga.lunas in a forest of silk-cotton trees, and the fourth took birth with the chief queen of King Dhana&ntilde;caya Korabya. At his father's death Prince Korabya succeeded to the throne.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Korabya was passionately fond of dice, but abiding by the instructions of his minister Vidh&ucirc;ra, observed his fasts and religious duties. One fast-day, in order to be quiet, he went into his garden. Sakko, the N&acirc;ga king, and the Ga.luna king, also came to that garden to spend the fast-day in quiet meditation; and, in the cool of the evening, all four met at the auspicious water-tank and recognized each other. Sakko sat on the auspicious stone slab, and the others seated themselves in suitable places.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sakko then asked: "Which of us four kings, do you think, has performed the most excellent duty?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Varu.na, the N&acirc;ga king, answered: "I think mine is the best. The Ga.lunas generally take our lives, and yet, when I saw their king, I displayed no anger."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of the Ga.lunas said: "This N&acirc;ga king is the food in which we most delight, and yet, though oppressed by hunger, I did him no harm."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sakko said: "I have left the wonderful pleasures and delights of T&acirc;vatimsa and come down to this earth to keep my fast."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said King Korabya: "I have left the delights of my palace and sixty thousand concubines and come to fast in this garden."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the four kings extolled their own piety.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the three kings: "O King Korabya, have you no wise man in your dominions who can dispel our doubts in this matter?" King Dhana&ntilde;caya Korabya answered: "I have a wise minister named Vidh&ucirc;ra, and he will probably be able to do so."</P>

<!------------------------p. 443------------------------>

<A NAME="page_443"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 443</FONT></A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they all agreed to go to the Judgment Hall, and, having caused Vidh&ucirc;ra to take his seat on a splendid couch, stated their case to him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vidh&ucirc;ra (after questioning them) replied: "O kings, your words are all good, and there is no fault in them. Wise men say that, like an axle well fitted to the hub of a wheel, those persons who are longsuffering, who do no ill to obtain food, who avoid lust, and have no anxiety, are they who in this world have extinguished evil" (Sama.na"m).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hearing this, the four kings gave great praise to Vidh&ucirc;ra, and said: "Indeed, thou art a religious person. There is no one equal to thee. Thou canst decide clearly, as the worker in ivory cuts through an elephant's tusk with a saw."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sakko presented him with a valuable cloth. The King of the Ga.lunas gave him a golden flower garland. The King of the N&acirc;gas presented him with a priceless ruby; and King Korabya gave him one thousand milch cows, ten bulls, ten elephants, ten horses, ten chariots with Sindh horses, and the revenue of sixteen villages.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the King of the N&acirc;gas had a queen, whose name was Vimal&acirc;, and, when he returned, she noticed that the ruby he usually wore round his neck was gone, so she said: "My Lord, where have you left your ruby?" He answered: "Lady, I wished to do honour to Vidh&ucirc;ra, the son of Canda, the Brahman, who decided a case for me, and gave it to him. Sakko gave him a cloth. The Ga.luna king gave him a gold garland, and King Korabya also gave gifts."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Vimal&acirc; asked whether he was one who preached the law; and on being told that there was no one equal to him, she thought thus: "If I were to say--'My Lord, I want to hear him preach the law: bring him here,' the King would not bring him. I will say that I want this wise man's heart, and, by worrying the King, get what I want." So she went into her inner chamber, and, giving notice to her attendants, went to sleep. On that day the N&acirc;ga king, at the time when the Queen and concubines usually came to pay their respects to him, missing Vimal&acirc;, asked where she

<!------------------------p. 444------------------------>

<A NAME="page_444"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 444</FONT></A>

was. They told him she could not come, because she was ill. Hearing this, he got up from his seat, and, going to her couch and stroking her with his hand, said: "Lady, you are like a withered leaf, and your body emaciated. What ails you?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Vimal&acirc; answered: "O Lord of the N&acirc;gas, in the land of men if women do not get what they want they suffer great pain. I have a strong desire to obtain the heart of this wise Vidh&ucirc;ra, lawfully and not by force. When I have obtained his heart I shall be well. If I do not, I shall shortly die."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King answered: "Lady, if you wanted the sun, or the moon, there would be no difficulty. Even the kings of the island of Jambudv&icirc;pa find a difficulty in getting to see him. How, then, can he be brought here?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, the Queen turned her back on the King, saying: "If I cannot get the heart of Vidh&ucirc;ra, may I die on this very bed."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the King found she would not answer him he went into his chamber and threw himself on his couch, saying: "Who can bring Vidh&ucirc;ra's heart? Verily the Queen will die if she cannot get it."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then the Princess Irandhat&icirc;<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> came, magnificently dressed, to pay her respects to her father, and, seeing him so unhappy, said: "My father, you seem very unhappy: why is it?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father replied: "My daughter, your mother wants the heart of the wise Vidh&ucirc;ra; but who can bring him to N&acirc;ga-land? Dear daughter, you are the only person who can do it. If you wish to save your mother's life, search for a husband who can bring him." The King was so wrapped up in his desire to preserve his Queen's life, that he spoke thus shamefully to her, telling her to get a husband.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irandhat&icirc;, having pacified her father, went in to see her mother, and, after comforting her, dressed herself in all her

<P><SMALL>[1. Irandhat&icirc;: is this a form of Arundhat&icirc;, one of the stars, and said to be the wife of the seven Rishis?]</SMALL></P>

ornaments and, that very night, took her way through the water to the upper world, and went to a place in the Himavanta near a river where there is a mountain called K&acirc;.la. That mountain is sixty y&ucirc;jan&acirc;s in height, and entirely composed of black rocks. Having gone thither, she collected a number of beautiful flowers, and strewed them all over the mountain, and made it look as if it were a heap of rubies; she spread a bed of flowers on the summit, and began to dance and sing, saying<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP>--</P>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then Pu.n.naka, the nephew of the Deva Vessava.n (Kuvera), riding on his horse Manomaya, was on his way to the assembly of the Rakshasas, and heard her song. As she had once been his wife in a former existence, as soon as he heard her he was smitten with delight, and, stopping his horse, said: "Lady, by the power of my wisdom, I will bring you Vidh&ucirc;ra's heart. Be not afraid. You shall be my wife."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hearing this, Irandhat&icirc; replied: "Go at once and demand me of my father."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overcome with love, Pu.n.naka dismounted and stretched out his hand to put Irandhat&icirc; on his horse, but she drew back, saying:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this, Pu.n.naka at once proceeded to the Serpent King's palace, and addressed him thus:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of the N&acirc;gas, list unto my suit,<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ages have passed since first our lots were linked:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love her still, and she to me inclines.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take as her price one hundred elephants,<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piled with the seven gems, to which are yoked<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of this widespread realm, we need no gifts:<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All-wise Vidh&ucirc;ra? 'Tis his heart we want.<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pu.n.naka ordered his attendant to get ready his horse Manomaya, and, urged by his great love for Irandhat&icirc;, having smoothed out his beard and hair and arranged his clothes, mounted and set off on his way to the dwelling of his uncle Kuvera (Vessava.n).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On arriving there he recited some stanzas descriptive of the beauty and wealth of Kuvera's city. He recited these verses because he did not dare to carry off Vidh&ucirc;ra without his uncle's permission. Kuvera, however, was deciding a dispute between two devas, and did not attend to him, so Pu.n.naka sat down near the deva who had won his case. Kuvera, turning to the deva, gave him an order to go and take possession, so Pu.n.naka took the order as if it were given to himself, and went off with him. On the way he thought thus: "Vidh&ucirc;ra's attendants are very

numerous; I shall not be able to take him unawares. King Korabya is passionately fond of dice. I will win him from Korabya by a cast of the dice. King Korabya is very wealthy, and will not play with me for anything of small value. In the hill of Vepulla, near R&acirc;jagriha, there is a ruby fit to be worn by Cakkavatti monarchs; it is a ruby of great power. I will overcome him by means of that ruby." He accordingly went to R&acirc;jagriha, in the country of A"nga.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The translator here remarks: "Why is it said that R&acirc;jagriha is in A"nga, when it is in Magadha?"--It is because at that time the King of A"nga ruled over Magadha.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ascending to the top of Mount Vepulla, he came to the place where that wonderful ruby which is called Manohara (Captivating) is guarded by 100,000 Kumbha.n.das. Terrifying them by his terrible glances, he took the ruby and pursued his way to Indapattanagara"m. On arriving there, he got off his horse and left it in concealment near the city. Taking the form of a young man, he approached King Korabya and addressed him thus:--</P>

<P ALIGN="center"><I>Pu.n.naka.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this assembly of chiefs, who will play with me for an excellent stake? From which of you shall I be able to win something of value? Who of you wants to win my incomparable treasure?"</P>

a band of horses, which could not be distinguished, and even Pu.n.naka himself was not distinguishable, but the red girdle on his waist was like the whirling of a firebrand. Having thus displayed the good qualities of his horse, he dismounted and said: "O King, have you beheld the power of my horse?" And, on the King replying that he had seen it, he said, "Look again," and rode his horse across the surface of the lake which was in the royal park, backwards and forwards, so that not even its hoofs were wetted. Having caused it to stand on a lily-leaf, he spread out his hand and it stood upon the palm. When the King remarked, "This is, indeed, very wonderful," he replied: "Now behold the power of my ruby. You have only to look into it to see<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> everything that is in this city or on the face of the earth, and all the delights of Devaland."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the King summoned all his nobles, and ordered a place to be prepared. The nobles, having spread curiously-worked carpets and arranged places for the King and his hundred nobles, suitably to their rank, reported to the King that all was ready.</P>

gaming-place, and: said: "My lord king, you have stated that you will play with me for anything save your royal person, your queen, or your throne, and your words are as ivory [<I>i.e.</I> firm]; but I am a poor person and you are the lord of many. If you win, you will assuredly take my ruby; but if I lose, you may delay in paying me, and fall back upon the fact that you are a king: how, then, can I play on equal terms?" But the King replied: "Kacc&acirc;ya.no, be not afraid; whether I win or lose I will act according to the law."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Pu.n.naka called all the kings who were present to bear witness, saying: "Kings of Pancala, Paccuggata, S&ucirc;rasena, Madda, and Kebhi, who are here assembled, you have heard the words of Korabya your lord. Take good note of them. You are all law-abiding kings, and I call upon you to be my witnesses, without fear or favour; listen and watch between us, and according to the custom of the righteous, with heed, observe closely, and do that which is right."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon King Korabya, surrounded by a hundred princes, proceeded to the gaming-shed, and they sat in their appointed places; and King Korabya placed the golden dice upon a silver table.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Pu.n.naka said suddenly: "My lord king, the marks upon the dice are called 'th&eacute;,' 'than,' 'einz&eacute;,' and 'nguzon'<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP>: take which you please." The King elected to take "einz&eacute;" and Pu.n.naka took "than."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King then called upon Pu.n.naka to throw first; but Pu.n.naka said: "My lord king, I am a poor man: it is not right that I should begin; it is for you to throw first." So the King agreed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there was a fairy, who had been his mother in his third state of existence, who constantly looked after King Korabya, and through her power he had always won when he played with dice. He used also to sing the following verses whenever he played: (Sabb&acirc; nad&icirc; vi&ntilde;ka nad&icirc;, etc.), which mean--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then King Korabya, singing his gambling song, threw the dice into the air, but through Pu.n.naka's power they fell so that he would have lost; knowing, however, by his great skill that this would happen, he caught them before they fell on the silver table and again threw them into the air, but seeing that they would a second time fall against him, he again caught them in his hand.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Pu.n.naka looked round to see the reason, and observed the good fairy standing near the King. He thereupon glared fiercely at the fairy, and she fled terrified to the top of a mountain on the confines of the world. The King then threw them again thrice, but by Pu.n.naka's power was prevented from putting out his hand to catch them before they fell. Then Pu.n.naka threw, and seeing that he had won, rose from his seat and cried, "I have won, I have won." And the sound of his voice was heard throughout all Jambudv&icirc;pa.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Korabya was very sad at having lost, so Pu.n.naka, in order to comfort him, said: "My lord king, when two persons have a wager each puts forth all his strength

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vidh&ucirc;ra saw the King coming he descended from the judgment-seat and sat in a suitable place. Pu.n.naka then addressed him thus: "O wise minister, you are well established in the law, and would not speak falsely even to save your life. These things are known unto all men.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day Vidh&ucirc;ra, having bathed and dressed himself, went to the King's palace, to pay his respects and take leave,--and addressed the King thus:--"My lord king, this young man is taking me away; his mind is set upon going. I would speak to thee concerning the good of my family: listen, victorious one. When the youth asked me how I was related to thee, I truly replied that I was thy servant. That, indeed, is the only fault, as far as I can see, that I have committed. If a man slips upon the earth

The meaning is obscure, and the Burmese translation is: "On beholding pots full of water, kingfishers and other birds, though they can give no advantages, yet we salute them with raised hands."]</SMALL></P>

and falls, on that spot even be must remain. That slip of mine I look at as my fault. Be not angry with me for that error, but take care of my family and possessions, and let them not be destroyed."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not pleasant to hear that you must depart. I will endeavour by some stratagem to prevent your departure. I will summon the youth to my palace and secretly make away with him."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lord, though this thought of thine arises through love and pity for me, it is not right; there is no benefit in it. Put it from thee and think only of what is meritorious. All beings must grow old and die. I bear no ill-will to this youth. He may beat me, or free me, or kill me. Being his slave, I must submit to his will and go with him."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Vidh&ucirc;ra, having respectfully saluted the King, and admonished the nobles and attendants, left the palace; and all the queens and ladies, being unable to restrain their feelings, with dishevelled hair and streaming eyes, beating their breasts, followed him in great sorrow. The people of the city came in crowds to see him depart; and he exhorted them, saying: "Be not sorrowful: actions, affections, seasons, food, are all impermanent. Both one's earthly body and possessions must come to an end; therefore, reflecting on these things, we should give alms and observe our religious duties." Having thus admonished them and sent them home, he proceeded to his house. Just then his son Dhammap&acirc;la, and the rest of his family, having come out to look for him, met him at the gate; and when he saw his children, being unable to restrain his sorrow, he embraced them, weeping, and entered into his house. Now Vidh&ucirc;ra "the wise" had a thousand sons, a thousand daughters, a thousand wives, and seven hundred concubines, and very

many slaves and kinsmen. The whole of these were smitten with grief and sorrow, and lay prostrate as the "sal" trees when smitten by a whirlwind from Mount Yugantara; and with a mighty murmur they besought him not to leave them; but, having comforted them, and set his household affairs in order, he left them and entered into the presence of Pu.n.naka, saying: "Youth, in accordance with my wish, you have waited here in my palace two or three days, and my instructions to my family are complete: do according to your wish."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="center"><I>Pu.n.nka.</I></P>

<P>Then, fearless as a lion, he uttered this act of truth: "May this cloth with which my loins are now girt ne'er leave me as long as I require it"; and, mounting on to the horse's crupper, and firmly grasping the tail, he said: "Youth, I have firm hold of your horse's tail: go whithersoever you desire."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that instant Pu.n.naka thought, "What is the use of my taking this Vidh&ucirc;ra to a distant place? I will carry him to the Himavanta forest, and, having dragged him through the ravines and thorn-brakes till the life is out of him, cast his dead body into a chasm, and carry his heart to N&acirc;ga-land." So he directed his horse Manomaya thither, and urged him swiftly through the trees. But by the

virtue of the Bodhisat's accumulated merit the trees kept away from his body for the distance of a cubit.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Pu.n.naka looked back to see if he were dead, and beheld his face shining with brightness, he again urged his horse thrice through the thickets; but to no purpose. Being greatly enraged, he rode into a mighty wind, but by the power of the Bodhisat it divided in two; and though he did this seven times he was unable to kill him, so he carried him off to the mountain called K&acirc;.l&acirc;giri.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Vidh&ucirc;ra's wives and family, thinking that he was a very long time in the upper chamber with Pu.n.naka, ascended to see what he was doing; and when they saw him not, raised a great cry, saying, "This demon in the likeness of a youth has carried off our lord"; and they wept and wailed bitterly. And when the King heard the sound thereof, he inquired what was the matter; and when they told him, he comforted them, saying: "Be not afraid, and cease from weeping, for he can preach the law sweetly, and will bring that youth to reason. Do not be so disturbed: he will soon return."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Pu.n.naka arrived at the top of K&acirc;.l&acirc;giri, he thought--"If I do not kill this Vidh&ucirc;ra I shall not get Irandhat&icirc;, and all my trouble will be for nought. I will kill him, and, having taken out his heart, carry it to Queen Vimal&acirc;, and bear away Irandhat&icirc; to my abode. It will not, however, do for me to kill him with my own hands, but I must cause his death through fear." So he set Vidh&ucirc;ra down on the peak of the mountain, and took the appearance of a frightful demon, which threw Vidh&ucirc;ra prone on his back, and then held him between its tusks as if it would devour him; but the Bodhisat was not in the least terrified. He then endeavoured to frighten him by taking the appearances of a lion, a must elephant, and a huge serpent; but the Bodhisat was not terrified by them. Then, thinking he would grind him to powder, he caused a mighty whirlwind to blow on him as he lay on the mountain-top; but that wind did not even disturb one hair of his head. He then caused the whole mountain

of K&acirc;.l&acirc;giri to be agitated, but was unable to terrify him; so he entered into the heart of the mountain and yelled loudly, but, though the noise was terrible, the Bodhisat was not disturbed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding that he could not terrify him by any of these means, he, in the form of a frightful demon, took him by both feet and hurled him from the top of K&acirc;.l&acirc;giri; but the Bodhisat fell lightly, as a ball of dressed cotton, at a distance of fifteen y&ucirc;jan&acirc;s. Then, taking him up again head downwards and finding that he was not yet dead, he hurled him again into the heavens, and he fell at a distance of sixty y&ucirc;jan&acirc;s.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this had been done, the Bodhisat thought--"He may hurl me away again, or, taking me by the feet, beat me to death against this mountain, but I shall not be afraid; for to say nothing of these terrors, if at the end of this cycle, during the 'samva.t.tath&acirc;y&icirc;' (desolation?),<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> even were I cast down from the realms of Vehapphalo into bottomless void, yet by reason of 'self-possession' I should have no fear; I should still be Vidh&ucirc;ra, the wise minister of the King of Kuru." Then he said:--"Youth, your appearance is that of a good man, but you are not so. Your appearance is that of one who keeps himself under restraint, but you do not do so. You do that which is evil and profitless. Your actions are not meritorious. Why do you hurl me into these chasms? What advantage will you gain by my death?

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="center"><I>Pu.n.naka.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O wise minister, I will tell you. I know not whether it was because we were once married and loved each other in a former existence, but from the first moment that I saw her I was urged by love to demand her from the N&acirc;ga king, who informed me in the verses beginning 'Dujjemukho,' etc., that I must obtain lawfully, as her price, the heart of Vidh&ucirc;ra; and, therefore, I desire to get your heart. I do not desire to injure you for a mere idle whim. I won you lawfully and I desire to take your heart lawfully and present it to the N&acirc;ga king, so that I may obtain Irandhat&icirc;. And as your death would be a great advantage to me, I have brought you to this place."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bodhisat, on hearing this, reflected--"What does Vimal&acirc; want with my heart?<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> Varu.na, having heard me preach the law, and having presented me with the ruby that adorns her neck, will probably, when he returned to the N&acirc;ga country, have praised my preaching before his queens and courtiers; and, on that account, his chief queen, Vimal&acirc;, wishing to hear me, has laid this stratagem, and Varu.na, not understanding it, has sent this ignorant Rakshasa Pu.n.naka, and he is ill-treating me owing to his bad disposition. I indeed am wise, but if I die by the hand of this Pu.n.naka what will be the use of my having been wise? I will even now show him my power." So he said: "Youth, listen to the law called 'S&acirc;dhunara,' and after you have heard it do with me according to your desire."</P>

has ever been preached before to men and devas," raised up Vidh&ucirc;ra and set him on his feet on the top of the mountain, saying: "I have taken you out of the abyss and set you on the mountain. I have other business besides taking your heart, so that no good law may be unknown to men make it known to me."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bodhisat answered: "Youth, since you have other business besides taking my heart, and have saved me from the abyss, and, desiring to hear the law called 'S&acirc;dhunara,' have set me on the top of this mountain, I also will declare this law unto you; but my body is covered with dust and dirt, and it is not proper to preach when the body is defiled with dirt: permit me, I pray you, to bathe."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Pu.n.naka brought bathing water, and caused the Bodhisat to bathe in it; and when he had done, dressed him and anointed him with fairy scents, and fed him with fairy food. Then, having prepared the top of K&acirc;.l&acirc;giri in a suitable manner for preaching the law, the Bodhisat, sitting cross-legged, said--</P>

<P>These are the four precepts of the 'S&acirc;dhunara,' and he who adheres to them may be called a good man."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pu.n.naka, not being able to understand, answered: "O wise one, who is he that has gone before? Why must one not dry the wet hand? Who is he that errs against his friend? What is a wanton? Explain to me this law; it is too difficult for me to understand."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereupon the Bodhisat replied: "If another should confer acts of hospitality on oneself, though he has never seen or met one before, to that person one should in like manner repay with gratitude those acts which he has done. This is the law called '<I>Y&acirc;t&acirc;nuy&acirc;y&icirc;</I>.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Though a badly-disposed woman be taken in marriage, and obtain all the worldly goods it is possible to give her, yet, if she sees an opportunity for entertaining a lover, she will do injury to her husband without thought of gratitude. Verily, if a man be overcome by the blandishments of such a woman and gives her all her desires, his profit will be nought, and he will be harassed in body and mind. This is the law called '<I>Asat&icirc;nam nagacche</I>.'"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bodhisat having thus preached the law, Pu.n.naka thought thus:--"The wise one appears by these four laws to ask for his life. He never saw my face before, and though I was not his close friend, yet he treated me in his house as if I had dwelt with him aforetime. I enjoyed his hospitality for three or four days, and now the only reason I have for ill-treating him is for the sake of a woman. If I look at these four laws I see that I have been false to my friend. If I were to kill him I should verily be one who follows not the law called 'S&acirc;dhunara,' and if I am said to be one who does not according to this law I should not be desired by the N&acirc;ga king's daughter. I will restore the wise one to his country, and gladden the hearts of his people and family": so he said: "O most excellent one, I dwelt in your home for several days, and you fed me; you are indeed a friend against whom I should not transgress. Truly, I will release you. I deserve not the N&acirc;ga king's darling; through desire for her I ought not to have done this evil deed. Because you have preached the law well I will free you from death."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said this the Bodhisat answered: "O Deva, do not convey me to my home yet. Since I have never yet

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pu.n.naka thereupon answered gladly: "We will go at once to the glorious land of the N&acirc;gas, and thou shalt behold it. That country is full of all splendours and delights." When they arrived there, Pu.n.naka, placing the Bodhisat behind him, went into the presence of the N&acirc;ga king; and when the King saw them he said: "Youth, you went to the country of men to fetch the heart of the wise Vidh&ucirc;ra: now that you have brought him himself, is your purpose accomplished?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Pu.n.naka answered: "My lord king of the N&acirc;gas, you desired Vidh&ucirc;ra, and he has come. I obtained him lawfully. Behold him. There is great happiness in associating with good people, even though it be for a moment."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May you dwell happily in your palace with this lovely N&acirc;ga princess for the rest of your existence, and may nothing interfere with your mutual love; and since you are a true friend, you may give me the ruby and restore me to my home."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, let us depart. Get up on to my horse." And placing Vidh&ucirc;ra before him on his horse "Manomaya," in an instant, after bidding farewell to the N&acirc;ga king, they arrived in the country of Kuru, where Pu.n.naka set him down, and, after again thanking him, rode off to the realms of the four great R&acirc;jas.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of the day on which Vidh&ucirc;ra returned, King Korabya dreamed that there was a great tree near the door of his palace covered with sweet fruit, and which gave shade and shelter to all kinds of animals, and that all men made offerings and adorations to it. A cruel-looking black man, carrying a sword and wearing a bright red cloth, came and cut down this tree and took it away, to the great grief of everyone. Not long afterwards the same savage-looking man came back and set it up as it was before.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the King awoke he related his dream, and felt sure that it related to Vidh&ucirc;ra; for none other than Vidh&ucirc;ra could be like unto this tree, for his wisdom resembled the roots, his religious duties the branches, and his preaching the sweet fruit. He felt sure, therefore, that Vidh&ucirc;ra was about to be restored to him, and was joyful. He therefore ordered the city to be decorated, the court to be prepared, and all the princes and nobles to be assembled.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Pu.n.naka set Vidh&ucirc;ra down in the law-court, and went off with Irandhat&icirc; to "Catumah&acirc;r&acirc;j," the King was overcome with delight; and, rising from his seat, took him by the arm and led him to the throne that had been prepared opposite to him, and thus addressed him: "Vidh&ucirc;ra, you have come back to rejoice my heart as a chariot that has been repaired after it has been broken. How did you escape from the hands of the youth who took you away?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vidh&ucirc;ra then related (in verse) all that had befallen him, and at the conclusion said:--"Thus, O King, because Pu.n.naka had set his affections on Irandhat&icirc; he carried me off to slay me; but obtained his desire only by placing full reliance on me. The King of the N&acirc;gas, and his queen Vimal&acirc;, too, by obtaining my heart, which is 'true wisdom,' were satisfied. In gratitude the N&acirc;ga king restored me to my home and country, and I obtained the wonderful ruby which may be worn by Cakkavatti monarchs alone; I now present it to you, my Lord."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King then related his dream to the assembly, released all those who were in prison, and proclaimed a universal holiday for a month.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the rejoicings were over, and to the end of his life, Vidh&ucirc;ra instructed the King and his people with discourses in almsgiving and religious duties, and when he died passed to T&acirc;vatimsa. All those who were confirmed in the law went to the land of the Devas.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the J&acirc;taka the Buddha summed up as follows: "The then king and queen are now my royal

<P><SMALL>[1. Both R&ucirc;pa and Moggali are here called "Pu.n.n&ecirc;ma," the fem. form of "Pu.n.n&acirc;," {Burmese: <I>Pu.n.n&acirc;</I>} used by the Burmese to denote a Brahman. Stevenson has made no attempt in his dictionary to explain the word. The fem. is evidently Pu.n.ni + <I>ma</I>, the Burmese fem. affix. The word is probably a very old one, and derived rather from Sanskrit than Pali.]</SMALL></P>
