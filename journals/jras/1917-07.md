## A COSMOLOGICAL TRACT BY PSEUDO-DIONYSIUS IN THE SYRIAC LANGUAGE

By GIUSEPPE FURLANI, P<span class="small">H</span>.D., J.U.D.

 

   THE small cosmological tract I here publish, and which is attributed
to Dionysius, Bishop of Athens, I have taken from the MS. marked 7192
Rich., now Add. 7192, of the British Museum.<span
id="page_245_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_245_note_1) This is a MS. in quarto
on vellum, containing not more than seventy-six folios, and belongs
probably, so far as we can judge from the good *esṭrangĕlô* chacter in
which it is written, to the eighth century. The treatise begins on f.
57*c*—there are two columns of thirty-one lines on every page—and ends
on f. 63*b* at the bottom. It is followed by another tract from the hand
of the same author—the contents and the style, and especially the
concluding lines which are nearly identical to the last ones of the
tract we publish, at least point to the same author—that bears the
following inscription: \#\#\#. It is an anti-astrological and
anti-magical tract, as it undertakes to demonstrate that divination by
means of the "stars, the zodiacal signs, the horoscopes, the fortunes,
the chances, the hours, the convulsions, the auguries, the divinations,
and all the deception of the Chaldæans, sons of deception" is not to be
relied upon, and is contradictory the facts that daily observation
affords us.

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

   The MS. is, in the part at least we treat of, well preserved. Only
column *a* of f. 58 is a little indistinct, but nowhere is the reading
rendered difficult. The inscription and the words we have underlined are
written with red ink. On the margin of f. 58*c* something has been
written by some reader, but subsequently it has been erased.

   The tract is attributed to Dionysius, Bishop of Athens, for reasons
easily to be understood. It is impossible for us to discern whether the
author of this tract himself is the cause of the pseudo-epigraphy or
whether some copyist or reader has added the false attribution.

   It presents a certain interest, as it is the first Syriac tract we
know that bears a very strict connexion with the apocryphical book of
Enoch, and is able to throw some light on the sources of "the book of
the courses of the heavenly luminaries" that forms chapters lxxii-lxxxii
of the aforesaid book.

   We give a translation of it, and point out the relations and
discrepancies existing between our tract and the Book of Enoch.

TRANSLATION

> *A Calculation and Computation, in which there is no mistake, made by
> the holy Mar Diônĕsiôs, Bishop of Athens.*
>
>    As the calculation and computation of the sun and the moon are
> confused by many of those who think in themselves that they are wise
> men, . . . the heavenly courses of the sun and the moon and the stars,
> and the rotation and revolution of the firmament, and the breath of
> the air that is contained in the midst and also of the twelve winds
> that come out from the twelve storehouses in which the activity of the
> moon takes place and in which it is born. By these twelve storehouses
> of the wind, indeed, we know in which of them the birth of the moon
> takes place, whether it is born in the wind or the rain or the snow or
> the dew or the heat, or what is the function of every one of the
> months. Whensoever one of these storehouses is shut, the change of one
> produces darkness. For the sun and the moon do not run by one
> computation. That cannot take place, <span id="page_258">p. 258</span>
> because the two have not one and the same course of movement. The sun
> completes the course of its movement in the number of three hundred
> and sixty-five days, or four thousand three hundred and eighty hours.
> The sun has every year, three super-abundant hours, which constitute
> every four years a complete day. This day is called the intercalary
> (day), and is intercalated at the 25th of Shebat according to the
> computation that the Greeks and the Syrians use. In the year that is
> called the intercalary (year) there are three hundred and sixty-six
> days by the computation of the Sun. But the moon has the number of
> three hundred and fifty-four days, and of these eleven days that are
> superabundant in the sun is constituted the month that is called
> intercalary. This month makes in the year in which it is intercalated
> a change in one of these four computations. The complete weeks of the
> sun are fifty-two and one day, and the weeks of the moon fifty and
> four days, since the sun was thirty days old when it was created and
> the moon fourteen, and those days that were before the sun and the
> moon came into existence, have been included by me in the total
> number. On the day, indeed, on which the sun and the moon were created
> they saw one another's light, but the light of the sun did not
> overpower that of the moon, because as soon as the rays of the
> sun-globe appeared from the east, the moon sank in the west. But on
> the fifth day the sun came out from the eastern gate of the light and
> the moon from the western storehouse of the wind and they saw one
> another freely, and the rays of the sun entered into the circle of the
> moon and its light was extinguished. Behold, from that time it began
> this succession of waxing and waning and keeps the succession of
> conception and birth and the changes of the days. It does not change
> in consequence of its existence, but because it is the key of all the
> storehouses of the wind and these are not opened without it. It keeps
> this succession of waxing and waning and runs this track of its
> conception and birth in the number of sixty hours, twenty for the
> conception, in twenty the birth (takes place), and during twenty it is
> visible. At the same hour, indeed, it comes out from the storehouse in
> which it was born, since it has nine entrances and twelve exits of the
> months. But the Greeks say that there are only seven storehouses of
> the winds <span id="page_259">p. 259</span> and five entrances of the
> moon. Hence they put the light before the darkness. Being ashamed of
> what they have said, they have added mistake to mistake by stating
> that the darkness is uncreated and has not been made. And hence they
> have inreased their blunder by giving eternity to the darkness. A
> thing that has not been created and made is eternal. With all their
> computations, too, the Greeks mingle blunders.
>
>    Here fix the eyes of your mind on this orbit of the sun, how it
> moves above in the air!
>
>    The sun keeps completely the course of its movement. For it has
> twelve gates on the path of its movement through which the passage of
> its course takes place. For these twelve gates a clock is fixed that
> the course of its path may be equal. Every gate is separated from the
> next by the space of only one hour. Every hour contains a degree
> (step). Four winds cause the disc of the sun to run. Since the wind
> that is above is a strong wind, that makes the eyes flow, and if this
> breeze above were near to (what is) below it would not leave anything
> on earth that it did not destroy, and since the wind above is strong
> these four moderate winds embrace the disc of the sun. If a wind did
> not run before it \[the sun\] on the path of its movement and bar its
> disc that it may move with diseretion, the east wind would drive its
> disc from one end of the world to the other in one hour. If the south
> wind did not press it to the ends of the world, the wind that is
> blowing from the north would hurl it (to the south), and the south
> wind to the north if the north wind (did not press it to the south).
> These four winds retain the disc of the sun and watch over it that it
> may not incline towards one side. And now and then one of the
> storehouses that serve the wind from above is opened and the wind that
> comes out from one of the storehouses becomes stronger from the fact
> that it is yoked to the chariot of the sun and it throws its disc
> under the step (degree) of its passage and its light is darkened till
> its dise rises (again) and stands on the path of its movement. For as
> soon as one of the big dragons that rose from the sea in which they
> were born, that is outside the dwelling-place of mankind, mounts and
> throws himself into the middle sea, or one of the animals that are
> called Leviathan, one of the storehouses of the whirlwinds is opened
> and with <span id="page_260">p. 260</span> dreadful shaking and gusts
> and lightnings it mounts and throws itself into the midst of the
> mountains of the north. In these days great snakes, too, are born. The
> dragons, however, and the Leviathan are born only in the sea that is
> called Maqastekos (?). But in the days of summer the sun overpowers
> with its light all the ends of the earth, as soon as it mounts upon
> the fiery track, because when it mounts above, to the fervent heat
> that is under the firmament, its disc is heated by the heat from
> above. And the sun burns the whole earth like an oven of fire, because
> it has mounted to the wind of heat that blows from above.
>
>    Again, I explain without error to those who possess understanding
> the variation of the lower sea.
>
>    Under the earth is the dreadful sea (containing) much water, and
> under the water (there is) fire, and under the fire wind, and under
> the wind darkness, (but) under the darkness do not ask for anything.
> In the hot days of summer, as soon as the sun mounts to the upper
> region, to the heat of this firmament, its disc is heated in the heat
> above, and it heats the earth like an oven of fire. Suddenly the fire
> under the water is quenched, the waters of the lower sea stand up and
> the wind of cold blows on them, the cold mounts and ascends from the
> interior of the earth and passes into the roots of the trees and
> plants and into the veins of the rocks, and the dust of the earth
> becomes cold, that the sun may not burn the trees, the seeds, and the
> plants. For if the cold did not ascend from the interior of the earth
> the sun would not leave anything without burning it. People, too,
> would not be able to walk on the earth in consequence of the heat of
> the fire. Because the surface of the earth from beneath is made like a
> sponge and its whole interior is made of canals and hollows for the
> flowing of the water of the streams and springs, and also for the
> action of the cold and the heat. In the hot days of summer, where
> there is no water, the animals and the birds dig into the interior of
> the earth and find cold soil and are relieved by it. The men, too, who
> are in the southem countries, that is, in the land of Kûsh and Shebâ,
> dig into the sand of their land during the hot days of summer and,
> although naked, they are protected and relieved by the coolness.
>
>    Another season, the winter.
>
> <span id="page_261">p. 261</span>
>
>    In the days of winter, as soon as the disc of the sun is thrown to
> the south to the cold, the storehouses of the wind of snow and ice and
> blasts and whirlwinds (are opened), and the heat of the sun is
> assuaged, that the cold may not destroy the trees, the seeds and the
> plants and the men, animals and birds may not die from the cold of the
> winter, the fire under the water is heated. The water is heated by the
> fire that is under it, and the heat mounts and ascends through the
> canals and hollows of the earth and enters into the veins of the trees
> and melts the cold that is in the interior of the trees, the water and
> the soil of the earth. By the vapour of the heat that rises from the
> interior of the earth, the water of the springs is melted, and instead
> of the wind of cold there rises from within them the vapour of heat.
> The course of the heat that rises from underneath flows and assuages
> the intensity of the cold. The animals find for themselves life in the
> excrements that are strewn on the dung-hills. The birds find shelter
> during the nights above the waters of the rivers and the fountains and
> springs and grow warm by what is rising from the waters of the rivers,
> fountains, and springs. Also the men who dwell in the north in the
> interior of the mountains that are called the Paps of the North—their
> stones are of crystal, and beyond them there is no human dwelling,
> since above the river called Fire-river there is nothing besides
> Oqîanôs, the sea that surrounds the whole earth. In Oqîanôs there is
> not one single reptile creeping in the water, and no bird is to be
> found flying above it, because it surrounds the sea, as a wall
> surrounds a city. Above it is the paradise of the gods. The angels
> bring the souls of men to the mansions that surround the paradise, as
> soon as they come out from their bodies, that is the souls of the
> saints. For the souls of those who have committed iniquities are not
> reckoned worthy to pass to that region of life. Those men who dwell
> amidst the mountains of the north, get their food from the fruits of
> the trees and are long-lived. On the crystal stones of these mountains
> descends the amazing Raphantion (?). Also the men who dwell in the
> western countries in the cold winter days make use of excrement (as a
> means) to support their life, since they are deprived of the use of
> wood, and in the evening they bury the food of the morning in the dung
> and in the morning <span id="page_262">p. 262</span> they find it
> cooked. In the same way they treat the food of the evening.

>    Now that I have explained to you the combinations of the winter and

>
>    The chariot of the sun is not bound within the firmament since the
> disc of its light is set upon the wings of the wind and upon running
> wheels. It is a great distance under the firmament of which the
> Creator only knows the measure. For the stars are united to the
> firmament. Their creation is planted in it, and they are the lamps of
> its light and they come out from it and run in it. The moon, too, has
> a chariot that runs with the wind, and its course is under the
> firmament. They were called the luminaries of heaven, because the
> light of their creation is united to the firmament. Under the sun is
> the course of the clouds. The clouds are not something corporeal, and
> the shape in which they always appear is not a permanent appearance,
> since now and then they are turned by the wind and they are dissolved
> and change from their (former) appearance. You will believe this from

   I cite the Book of Enoch according to the English translation of R.
H. Charles, *The Book of Enoch or 1 Enoch*, Oxford, 1912, and where it
is necessary to refer to the Ethiopic text, according to the edition of
Dr. Joh. Flemming, *Das Buch Henoch, äthiopischer Text* (*Texte und
Untersuchungen*, N.F., Bd. vii), Leipzig, 1902.

   The first lines of our treatise, a brief introduction, belong of
course to the Syriac author of the treatise, and we have no ground for
supposing that he found it in the treatise that he has epitomized. There
is no doubt that he had before him a *Quellenschrift* that was different
from "the book of the courses of the heavenly luminaries" of the Book of
Enoch so far as the peculiarity of the cosmological theories that are
there expounded is concerned, but covered much the same ground as the
"book of the courses" does, namely, (1) the calendar, (2) the moon, (3)
the sun, (4) the winds. It is our duty now to determine what were the
exact contents of the original treatise epitomized by our author and
what <span id="page_265">p. 265</span> relation it bore to the "book of
the courses" embedded in the Book of Enoch, and it will not be difficult
to point out what our author has contributed himself or from other
sources to the compilation.

   In our treatise a close relation is said to exist between the twelve
storehouses of the wind and the moon, since in these the moon is
conceived and grows. In the Book of Enoch no such relation is stated.
According to our treatise the different phases of the moon depend upon
the storehouses.

   In the Book of Enoch there are mentioned the store-chambers of
blessing (cap. xi, 1, \#\#\#); closed chambers according to which the
winds are divided, the chamber of the hail and winds, the chamber of the
mist, and of the clouds (5); and I saw the chambers of the sun and moon,
whence they proceed and whither they come again (cap. xli, 4-5, in the
Ethiopic text \#\#\#); the chambers of the winds, and how the winds are
divided (cap. lx, 12, \#\#\#); the chambers of hail, hoar-frost, etc.
(cap. lxix, 23). I have no doubt that \#\#\# is a translation of the
Greek word ταμει̑ον, as in the title of the well-known exegetical work by
Bar ‘Ebrayâ \#\#\#, i.e. ταμει̑ον τω̑ν μυστηρίων. In the Greek text our
author had before him—that it was Greek text is proved by the fact that
the style of the treatise is bad and that the author employs very
frequently the demonstrative pronoun \#\#\#, and \#\#\# as a substitute
for the Greek article—ταμει̑ον τω̑ν πνευμάτων.

   The calendar described by Pseudo-Dionysius is completely different
from the calendars—there are different calendars—set forth in different
parts of the Book of Enoch. It does not agree with any one of them.

   No mention is made in the Book of Enoch of the circumstance that the
sun was thirty days old and the moon fourteen when they were created,
and that the sun <span id="page_266">p. 266</span> overpowered the moon.
In the commentary of Ephraim on the Book of Genesis I have found some
statements that, generally taken, agree with the theories of our author,
although they vary considerably in the particulars. I give a translation
of the Syriac text edited by P. Benedictus (Romæ, i, 1737): (p. 15 B)
the moon was placed in the west of the firmament and the sun in the east
of it; (p. 16 E) if they (sc. the sun and the moon) were full when they
were created and they were created in the morning, then the sun was
standing in the east and the moon opposite to it in the west. But the
sun was lying low and underneath, since it was created in the place from
which it comes out over the earth. The moon, however, was standing high,
since it was created in the place where it stands on the fifteenth day.
When the sun became visible to the earth the luminaries saw one another;
(p. 17 A) from the place of the moon, from its fullness and its shining,
it is clear that it was fifteen days old when it was created; (p. 17 C)
but it (sc. the sun) too, was four (days) old; (p. 17 D) these eleven
days by which the moon is older than the sun, and which were added to
the moon in the first year, are those that men who make use of the
computation of the moon add every year; (p. 17 E) for from this year
onwards the Adamites learned to add eleven days every year. It is not
the Chaldæans, therefore, who made this order of the times and the years
that were put in order before Adam.

   Ephraim evidently cannot have been the source of our author. Both
derive their theories from the haggadic tradition.

   I cannot state anything about the seven storehouses of the winds
according to the Greeks: they taught, of course, that there are seven
winds. This and the following disquisition about the darkness, directed
principally against Manichæism, is no doubt an addition of the Syriac
author, as it breathes the same contempt <span id="page_267">p.
267</span> of Greek natural philosophy that is a characteristic feature
of the mental attitude of most of the Syriac doctors towards Greek
theories so far as they contradict the teaching and statements of the
Bible.

   The description of the passage of the sun through the twelve gates is
not to be found in the Book of Enoch (f. 58*d*, l. 7-f. 58*d*, l. 12).

   Completely strange to the Book of Enoch is also the long description
of the relation between the winds and the sun and of the function they
perform according to the seasons (f. 58*d*, l. 12-f. 59*d*, l. 7). This
description is continued on f. 60*c*, l. 4-f. 61*c*, l. 4, and is only
apparently interrupted on f. 59*d*, l. 8-f. 60*c*, l. 3 by what purports
to be a statement about the lower sea. In the Book of Enoch we read only
that the winds turn the circumference of the sun (cap. xviii, 4) and
carry the clouds: I saw the winds of heaven which turn and bring the
circumference of the sun and all the stars to their setting. I saw the
winds on the earth carrying the clouds. In his journey to the north
Enoch sees also three portals of heaven open in heaven: through each of
them north winds come out: when they blow there is cold, hail, frost,
snow, dew, and rain. And out of one portal they blow for good; but when
they blow through the other two portals it is with violence and
affliction on the earth, and they blow with violence (cap. xxxiv, 2, 3).
See also cap. lx, 12, and 17-21 on the spirits of the hoar-frost, the
snow, the mist, the dew, the rain, and cap. lxix on their chambers. But
nowhere in the Book of Enoch is such a description of the sun, the
winds, and the seasons to be found; neither could such a theory be put
together from the statements contained in different parts of it. We are
therefore compelled to assume that the Syriac author found his theory
expounded in the cosmological treatise which he epitomized.

   All the statements in the description of our author are <span
id="page_268">p. 268</span> not clear. We should like, for instance, to
hear more about the relation existing between the storehouses of the
winds and the monsters in the lower sea (f. 59*c*, l. 3 ff.). As there
is a \#\#\# in which the monsters are born and from which they jump into
the \#\#\#, there must be also a \#\#\#, which is in direct relation
with the storehouses of the winds. We do not gather much about Leviathan
and the other monsters from the Book of Enoch, and what we learn from it
is at variance with the statements of Pseudo-Dionysius: (cap. lx, 7) and
on that day were two monsters parted, a female monster named Leviathan,
to dwell in the abysses of the ocean over, the fountains of the waters;
(8) but the male is named Behemoth, etc. Our author had avery hazy idea
about the monster Leviathan, as he speaks of the "animals which are
called Leviathan".

   For the general structure of the world, as outlined by our author, it
is interesting to note that he assumes the existence of the sea under
the earth—therefore also round the earth, that is, floating on it—and
under the sea the fire, and under the fire the air—\#\#\# has here no
doubt the connotation of air, as it has often in the commentary of
Ephraim, mentioned above—and under the air the darkness.

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

   This κόσμος does not show any similarity to the Greek or Babylonian
conceptions of the world.

   No mention is made of the ocean in the Book of Enoch (f. 61*a*, l.
4).

   f. 61*a*, l. 8. The MS. has \#\#\# (paradise of the gods). The Syriac
author was no doubt a Christian, as is proved by the disquisition about
the Holy Spirit. But perhaps the author of the treatise epitomized was
pagan Greek, although it is unsafe to assume it.

   The remark about the souls of the just is an addition made by
Pseudo-Dionysius. The doctrine of the mansions for the souls was a
common one and widely spread.

   The universe as sketched in the Book of Enoch has not a wall of
mountains round the earth, as our author assumes (f. 61*a*, ll. 5, 7).

   The description of the nature of the clouds is not to be found in the
Book of Enoch (f. 61*d*, l. 4-f. 62*a*, l. 6); it is probably an
addition made by our author.

   The comparison he makes between the oneness of the nature of the
winds and the oneness of the languages spoken by mankind was hardly to
be found in the source epitomized by Pseudo-Dionysius. It is an
addition, as also the style, that is here much better than in the purely
cosmological parts, shows. The same thing must be said about the
following comparison with the Indian language (f. 62*c*, l. 9-1. 11).

   The conclusion is, of course, to be ascribed to our author (f. 63*a*,
l. 7-f. 63*b*, l. 12).

   Of most of the terms enumerated in the concluding part, which denote
no doubt stars and constellations and are therefore astronomical
technical terms, I am not able to give the proper meaning. Bar ‘Ebrayâ
gives in his astronomical treatise that bears the title \#\#\# (edited
by F. Nau in fasc. 121 of the *Bibliothèque de l'école des hautes
études*, Paris, 1899) a long description of all the stars and
constellations according to Ptolemy, <span id="page_270">p. 270</span>
but I have not been able to trace any one of the technical terms
employed by our author. Some of them look rather like names of different
degrees of adepts of some religious sect. I have translated them
literally.

   The conclusions we arrive at after this brief examination can be
summed up as follows:—

   The work we have published is a compilation of an unknown Syriac
author with anti-Greek and anti-Babylonian tendencies so far as
cosmology and natural philosophy are concerned. It is a cosmological
work dealing especially with the sun, the moon, the winds, and the
calendar. The author assumes that his doctrines are derived from the
Bible—although he never says that expressly—that they are therefore
true, and that Greek science and Babylonian or Chaldæan astronomy are
false. He thinks that his work is a useful introduction to the science
of astronomy.

   We cannot state definitely whether the author himself ascribed his
work to Dionysius, the legendary first Bishop of Athens, or whether some
reader or copyist has done so. It seems to us that the second
alternative is more probable. The fact that it was ascribed to Dionysius
can be explained very easily. As the Syrians and Arabs attributed all
philosophical works, and particularly those about logic and metaphysics,
to Aristotle when they did not know the name of the real author, and all
medical works to Hippocrates or Galen, so, too, in our case we must not
be surprised that this work has been ascribed to Dionysius, the reputed
author of the celebrated mystical books about "heavenly science",
although these books do not treat of cosmological matters. But the
Syrians were not so particular about such nice distinctions. Sergius of
Rish‘ainâ is the first Syriac author who knows the works of
Pseudo-Dionysius—he has translated them into the Syriac language—the
false inscription is therefore later than the sixth century. <span
id="page_271">p. 271</span> This treatise, too, is later than that date,
as the style of it does not show in the parts the author has not
translated from his Greek source any of the characteristics of the Old
Syriac language.

   The compilation can easily be divided into its component parts: the
bulk of the work is a translation from the Greek, as is proved by the
bad style. The author has himself added only the introduction, the
conclusion, the observations about the darkness, the seven storehouses
of the winds according to the Greeks, the souls of the just, and the
nature of the clouds and the comparison between the oneness of all kinds
of winds and the oneness of human languages. These parts are certainly
to be ascribed to our author.

   What remains of his work bears a close resemblance to the "book of
the courses of the heavenly luminaries", that is, section iii (cap.
lxxii-lxxxii) of the Book of Enoch.<span
id="page_271_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_271_note_1) It covers nearly the
same ground, although it exhibits theories that are wanting in the Book
of Enoch and does not contain some pieces—especially the long digression
about the growth of the sun (cap. lxxii)—which we find in the third
section of the Book of Enoch. The peculiarity of the theories of our
author is remarkable. They do not agree exactly with any one of the
doctrines contained in the third section or scattered elsewhere in the
Book of Enoch. They belong, as it were, to the same family of theories,
but have their distinctive features. Appel has demonstrated that the
Book of Enoch is not unitarian so far as its physical theories are
concerned, but that in it we find remnants of *four* different treatises
of cosmological contents.<span id="page_271_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_271_note_2) Our <span
id="page_272">p. 272</span> work is not identical with any one of those
four treatises but is a *parallel text* to them. The doctrines expounded
in it are, so to say, more up-to-date and more in accordance with
astronomy than the doctrines of the four treatises epitomized in the
Book of Enoch. This holds good especially for the calendar.

   From our treatise we can therefore infer that the literature about
the mysteries of the heavens must have been very extensive indeed. Some
remnants of this literature we find in the Book of Enoch and in the
treatise we have published. The parallels we could cite from the
so-called *Slavonic Enoch* (trans. by W. P. Morfill and ed. by R. H.
Charles, Oxford, 1896) are only scanty and rather remote, if we except
the calendar.
