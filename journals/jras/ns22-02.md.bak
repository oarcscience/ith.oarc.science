A<span class="small">RT</span>. II.—*Book of the King's Son and the
Ascetic*. By E. R<span class="small">EHATSEK</span>.

 

T<span class="small">HE</span> striking fact that the Buddha has been
officially enrolled in the list of the saints of the Christian Church
has very naturally attracted much attention to the book to which this
strange result is due. This book, a romance in Greek, founded on some
unknown Buddhist life of the Buddha, was ascribed in some of the later
MSS. to St. John of Damascus, and this was the view held by scholars
until the publication in 1886 of the masterly monograph by M. H.
Zotenberg (Notices sur la livre de Barlaam et Joasaph). He there shows
conclusively that the John who was the author of the romance was not
John of Damascus, but a monk of the convent of St. Saba near Jerusalem,
who wrote it in the commencement of the seventh century <span
class="small">A.D.</span> This romance, whose hero, though really the
Buddha, appealed so strongly to the sympathies of the Christians, that
they raised him to the rank of a saint, contains, besides the
description of the life and character of the hero, a number of fables,
some of which have been traced back to the Buddhist Jâtaka book, while
the source of others is still unknown. This being so, it becomes of
great importance to ascertain the earliest form of the story. Now it is
admitted that the numerous versions of it in various European languages
(of which a list is given in my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' vol. i. pp.
xcv and foll.) are all derived from the Greek of John of St. Saba. There
is <span id="page_120">p. 120</span> also an Arabic version, written in
prose by a Christian, which M. Zotenberg has shown to have been based on
the Greek text (*loc. cit.* pp. 79-81). This was imitated in an Arabic
poem written by a Muhammadan, and now lost, and this again gave rise to
a Hebrew prose work called 'The Prince and the Ascetic.'

   At the Oriental Congress held at Vienna in 1888, Dr. Fritz Hommel
read a paper on a prose Arabic version of the story, written by a
Muhammadan, and described already in 1858 by Dr. Blau from a MS. in the
possession of the German Oriental Society. In the Transactions of the
Congress Dr. Hommel published the text of this version (also entitled
'The King's Son and the Ascetic'), which he believes to be translated
directly from an original Pahlavi version, and to be entirely
independent of the Greek romance. M. Zotenberg, on the other hand, holds
this version also to be based on the Arabic poem mentioned above. This
work is now presented in English to our readers in a version by Mr.
Rehatsek, of Bombay, and following, it is to be presumed, the Arabic
text as published by Dr. Fritz Hommel.

   It would be unnecessary to point out either the utility or the
interest of this labour for which we are indebted to Mr. Rehatsek. It
can of course throw no light on the still unsolved problem as to when
and where the hero of the story, the Buddha, was canonized as a
Christian saint. But on the other two questions which await solution,
that is to say, the early migration of the romance itself, and the
relation of the fables it contains to the Buddhist Jâtaka stories, it is
of the greatest importance.

 

   I would venture to call attention here to a very interesting
discussion of the history of the romance, written from <span
id="page_121">p. 121</span> the strictly Catholic point of view by M.
Emmanuel Cosquin, in the 'Revue des questions historiques' for October,
1880. Professor Max Müller's paper on it in his 'Selected Essays,' and
my own summary in the Introduction to my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' may
also be mentioned.

*Book of the King's Son and the Ascetic.*

   In the name of Allah the merciful the clement! This is an abridgment
from the book of one of the distinguished philosophers of India. It is a
book of eloquent allusions, pleasing instructions, and beautiful
meanings \[or ideas\]; may Allah cause us to profit thereby. Amen!

   The author of it has recorded that there was in the country of India
a great king, who, on account of his extreme love for the world, was
turned away from contemplating eternity so ardently towards \[the
affairs of\] his kingdom, that there was no one who dared to find fault
with him. He alienated the adherents of the \[Buddhist ?\] religion, and
attracted the adherents of the idols. Having one day made inquiries
about a man of the people of his kingdom whom he had been in the habit
of consulting, he was informed that he had verily abandoned the world,
his family, his property, and had joined the \[community of\] ascetics.
This greatly astonished the king, who then sent for the man, who on
making his appearance, and being seen in the condition of asceticism,
was reproved by the king as follows: "Whereas thou hast been one of the
grandees of my kingdom, thou hast \[now\] debased thy soul, hast
separated thyself from thy family and hast sought vanity." The ascetic
replied: "O king! Although thou art under no obligation to me, it is
nevertheless incumbent upon thee to listen to my words without anger,
and then to act as thou deemest suitable; because anger is a foe to
intellect, since it is a bar between <span id="page_122">p. 122</span>
him who is under its influence, and between what he is to hear and to
understand." The king replied: "Speak!" The ascetic then continued: "Is
the guilt of which thou accusest me to redound upon me, or upon thee?"
He said: "Upon thee and upon me; for, when any man wishes to commit
suicide, I must not leave him the option to do so. I consider the
destruction of his life \[to be\] like the destruction of any other
man's life, because I am his protector and the judge for and against
him. Accordingly I judge thee and punish thee for destroying a life of
my subjects, which is thy own life; for the loss and grief thou hast
brought upon thy family." The ascetic rejoined: "I do not think thou
canst punish me except by arguing, and an argument can be established
only by judges. Although at present no human judges can trouble thee,
thou possessest two of them, to one of whom I agree to submit." He
asked: "Who are these two?" The ascetic continued: "He to whose decision
I shall submit is thy intellect, but he from whom I desire to be excused
is thy wrath." The king replied: "Say what thou listest, but give me
some information, and tell me since when thou art of this opinion, and
who has helped thee thereto?" The ascetic continued: "As to my
information, it is that in my young years I heard one word which fell
into my soul, and became like seed sown; it then grew and prospered till
it became the tree which thou beholdest. I had namely heard a speaker
say that 'a fool considers that which is a thing to be nothing, and that
which is nothing to be a thing. He who does not scorn that which is
nothing will not obtain that which is a thing. He who does not look upon
that which is a thing, will not rejoice his soul by abandoning that
which is nothing. The thing is eternity, and that which is nothing is
the world.' This statement had impressed me, but it, and the prompting
thereby, as well as the contemplation thereof, were overpowered by
lusts, until the world appeared to me, as I believed it in my folly to
be, a thing, whereas it is nothing; since it has shown to me that its
life is death, its wealth is poverty, its joy is grief, its satiety is
hunger, its health is disease, its strength is weakness, <span
id="page_123">p. 123</span> its honour is degradation, its pleasure
pain. And why should not its life be death, since the tendency of life
therein is towards death; and why should its wealth not be destitution,
since no one gains anything therefrom without the need of something
else, in order to make it serviceable in the same way as the owner of a
beast requires the food for it, the price for it, the binding place
\[*i.e.* stable\] for it, and the utensils for it. Then, in order to
utilize all these things, he stands in need of something else, so that
when destitution is removed, and none befalls him from his family and
property, and \[from\] necessity, he is beset by other wants. And how
should not its joy be grief, since it \[*i.e.* grief\] is lying in wait
for every one whom gladness has befallen from it in order to pursue him
with grief: nor is any one addicted to the world secure, when he
experiences a joyful event, that this very event will not result in a
calamity to him. If then it be unavoidably necessary to become severed
from family, children, and property, and this separation takes place
forcibly in ways accompanied by many evils, is it not more worthy, with
reference to all the just-mentioned things, that an intelligent man
should abandon them voluntarily, before any of the just-noticed ways,
which often take place, befall him, and he should not be grieved if he
has obtained it \[*i.e.* worldly prosperity\], nor ought he, on the
contrary, to wish for it, and covet it, if he has not obtained it. And
how should not its repletion be hunger since it kindles \[thirst\] in
the body, and if he finds no water to quench it therewith, it consumes
his body, and if he prevents it from consuming his body, by nourishing
the latter with food and drink, this will be strength for the repetition
of a similar kindling; and the habit of repletion is \[followed by\]
weakness in hunger. And how should its health \[*i.e.* of the body\] not
be malady, since its health depends upon the equilibrium of the
agglomerated humours of it, which are antagonistic in their qualities;
and the \[substance\] most closely connected with life is the blood, as
well as the most evident. The blood is most closely connected with
sudden death, with pestilence, with angina, with quinsey, with cancer,
and with pleurisy. <span id="page_124">p. 124</span> And how should its
strength not be weakness, since it is necessarily subject to
dissolution? And how should its honour not be degradation, since we
never see in it an honour but it terminates with removal, and what
degradation is worse than removal from honour? And how should its
pleasure not be pain, since it is \[only\] the cessation of pain, and
terminating in the briefest period of time, is followed by that pain
which it had just caused to cease, and when we consider this
\[succession of pleasure and pain\] in the lives of kings, and their
terminations, we find the days of their honour short in comparison to
the days of their degradation, and the degradation of their
terminations. And, by my life! that man who has received enjoyment from
the world ought to despise it more, because it may happen any day that
it becomes inimical to his property, family, children, or dignity, or
body, or soul. Why should I not despise the world since it again takes
away what it bestows, brings on a bad end, despoils him of what it has
given him, and brings upon him ignominy; it abases him whom it exalts,
and causes him to grieve; it severs connection with its lover, and
repentance pursues him; it misleads him who obeys it, and wretchedness
pursues him; by its dalliance it invites falling into its snares, and
entails fatigue and trouble in \[those who strive for\] deliverance from
it. It is the companion of treachery and the road to destruction; it is
the much-stumbling ridden beast and the worn-out ship, the house with
many snakes, and the park abounding with beasts of prey. It is
considered necessary, but is not necessary to any one; it is the
mistress who loves no one; is playing with its companion whilst feeding
him, whereas it has destined him to be eaten; and making him its servant
whilst pretending to serve him. It makes him laugh, then laughs at him;
it insults him, and is then coveted by him; it makes him weep, then
weeps for him, and whilst it spreads out its hand for \[receiving\] a
gift, lo! it has spread it out for mendicancy and poverty; it knots
\[*i.e.* adorns\] his head with a crown, then buries his head under
ground; it ornaments hands and feet with gold, then shackles them with
iron; it seats a man on a throne <span id="page_125">p. 125</span> one
day, and seats him in prison the next. It spreads out for a couch gold
brocade to him in the morning, and spreads out for him earth in the
evening. It collects for him singers, buffoons, and panegyrists, then it
collects upon him \[*i.e.* his corpse\] persons who sing threnodies,
weep and lament; it causes his family to love his presence, then it
causes them to love his absence: it perfumes his odour to-day and
infests it to-morrow. It fills his soul with its hopes, and his fist
with its gifts in the morning, but plunders his soul and his fist in the
evening. It is pleased with a change of the whole in everything, and it
foists the base into the place of the excellent. It removes a nation
from scarcity to plenty, but also from rest to fatigue, and from hunger
to repletion, until when this \[state of affairs\] is reversed plenty is
snatched away, a bar is interposed between them and between easy
nourishment, so that verily strength is taken away from them after
abundance, and they return to the most fatiguing labour.

   As to thy words, O king, of my having ruined my family and abandoned
it: verily I have neither ruined nor abandoned it, but have joined
\[myself\] to it, and segregated \[myself from others\] to it; because I
was looking \[formerly\] with a bewitched eye, not distinguishing
therewith familiars from strangers, nor foes from friends, when however
I obtained a discerning eye, I looked, and lo! those whom I had reckoned
to be familiars, companions, and brothers, had become beasts of prey,
having no other care than to devour me, or \[fear\] to be devoured by
me. Their difference consisted in proportion of their excellence in
strength, some of them being like lions in bravery, or like wolves in
rapacity, or like dogs, now barking angrily and now cajoling
obsequiously, whilst some were like foxes in deceit and thieving; the
intention however was identical, although the mode \[of executing it\]
varied.

   If thou wert to consider thy own case, O king, thou wouldst perceive
that those of thy family, and those who obey thee, are worse
\[disposed\] towards thee than strangers and distant persons. But as to
my present state, I possess <span id="page_126">p. 126</span>
\[therein\] familiars, brothers, and protectors who love me, and whom I
love, so that love is among us, neither lost nor interrupted. They serve
me, and I serve them, for wages which do not fail; accordingly the
service is never discontinued. All of us aspire to what it is possible
to enjoy together; nor is any one of us prohibited from gathering for
himself at any time, what another gathers, so that there is neither
contention among us, nor envy concerning the manner in which he collects
it. These are the professors of \[the Buddhist ?\] religion whom I have
joined, and have aspired to safety for my soul as they have \[for their
own\]. But those whom I have spurned and cut off are the adherents of
the world, which is nothing, and thou verily knowest its attributes and
its acts, so that if thou desirest me to explain 'the thing' prepare to
listen to \[what I have to say of\] it." Then the king said to the
philosopher: "Thou discernest nothing, and conquerest \[discontent\]
only by \[enduring\] transitory wretchedness, and by \[entertaining\]
vain hope, and by \[bearing\] eventual privation. Depart from my
kingdom, for thou art corrupt."

 

*Nativity of the King's Son, may Allah approve of him.*

   In those days a boy was born to the king, and he was greatly
delighted thereat, because he was anxious to possess male offspring. He
then assembled the astrologers and the U’lamâ to prepare a nativity for
him, whereon they reported that \[the subject of\] this nativity would
attain a higher station than any king of the kings of the earth. A
scholar among them said thereon: "I do not think that the nobility this
boy will arrive at will be the kind of nobility that is attained in the
\[affairs of the\] world, and I am of opinion that he will become a
leader in asceticism, and of a high degree in religion among the degrees
of eternity." Hereon the king's joy at \[the birth of\] the son
disappeared; then by his order a town was set apart for him, and he
selected for his service and education trustworthy guardians, whom he
summoned to his presence and ordered never to mention among themselves
<span id="page_127">p. 127</span> death or eternity, neither religion
nor asceticism, and neither removal \[from this world\] nor return \[to
the next world\]; and that, if they perceived one of themselves
instilling into him doubts or complaints, they should make haste to
expel him from among them, so as to cut off from their mouths the
mention of the things he had prohibited them to notice. Accordingly when
the boy had become able to understand speech, nothing of the kind was
uttered by their tongues.

   The king happened to possess a wazir who satisfactorily administered
his affairs, but the favourites of the king envied him. He \[the wazir\]
went out to hunt, and met a cripple whom he questioned, whereon the
latter informed him that he had been maimed by a beast of prey. He said
to the wazir: "Attach me to thyself in order to find advantage by me."
He then ordered him to be conveyed to his habitation.

   The wazir happened to be a true believer \[in asceticism\], but
concealed his faith for a wise purpose. Envious persons then maligned
the wazir to the king, \[alleging\] that he was coveting the kingdom.
They said: "Try him by telling him that thou desirest to follow ascetism
and to abandon the kingdom, that thou mayest see him encourage thee
therein." This they did, because they knew the opinion of the wazir
concerning asceticism and the abandoning of the world. When the wazir
entered to the king, the latter said: "O wazir! thou hast indeed beheld
my greediness for \[the affairs of\] the world since I have become a
man, and verily I have investigated what has past, but find in my hand
nothing \[profitable\] from it, but that which remains \[of my life\]
resembles that which has elapsed, and will certainly also slide away
from my hand; wherefore I intend to exert that \[assiduity\] for
eternity, which I have exerted for the world, and for this \[purpose\] I
find no means except to abandon the kingdom and its people, and to
embrace ascetic life, and \[tell me now\] what is thy opinion?" The
wazir replied: "O king! That which remains \[or is permanent\], although
it is hoped for, does not \[yet\] exist, but is worthy to be sought, and
that which is perishable, although it exists, is worthy to be rejected."
Then the weighty impression this reply had <span id="page_128">p.
128</span> produced manifested itself on the face of the king, and the
wazir returned to his house in fear, not knowing what to do. He then
interviewed the cripple, and informed him of what had taken place. The
latter replied: "I am of opinion that the king thinks thy intention is
to succeed him in his dominions; therefore, when thou risest in the
morning, thou must throw away these habiliments of thine, don the garb
of asceticism, and shave thy head; then go publicly to the palace of the
king. This will astonish the people, who will inform the king about thy
state, and he will then call thee and ask thee concerning thy act. Then
say: 'This is what thou hast invited me to, because it is proper that he
who advises his companion and master to do a thing, should not demur to
share it with him. Arise then with us, because I consider that to which
thou hast invited me, to be the most rational and most excellent \[of
pursuits\] in which we are \[capable of engaging\].'"

   The wazir did as he was bidden by the cripple, whereon the king
vented the anger which was in his soul upon him, and relegated him in
his irritation to a place of the ascetics whose habitations were in the
hearts of the people \[or, who lived in the very midst of the people\].
Then he ordered them to be exiled from his whole country, threatening
them with death if they refused compliance; accordingly they began to
flee and to abscond. The king went out \[afterwards\] to hunt, and
perceiving two men from a distance, he had them brought to his presence,
and lo! both were ascetics. Then he asked them why they had delayed
leaving. They replied: "We are weak, have no beast, nor provisions." The
king said: "Who fears death, let him make haste \[to depart\] without
provisions." They both continued: "We do not fear death, but expect it,
and are pleased therewith, but we have abandoned what rejoices the
inhabitants of the earth, have left it and do not return to it." He
asked: "Then you have really not fled from fear of death?" And they
replied: "No! We have fled because we disliked to aid thee against
ourselves \[*i.e.* to aid thee to get us into thy power\]." Then the
king ordered them to be burnt, and proclaimed <span id="page_129">p.
129</span> the cremation of all ascetics to be found in his dominions.
Pray Allah be pleased with both of them!

 

*Attainment of Puberty by the King's Son.*

   The son of the king grew most handsomely in body, prospered in his
education, and progressed in his learning \[under his instructors\], but
discovered that he was guarded by them from going out, looking, and
hearing. Then he said: "Perhaps they know better \[than myself\] what is
good for me;" but when he increased in years, in experience, and in
intellect, he said: "I do not see that they possess excellence over me,
and I must not allow them the management of my affairs, and I shall
leave the option to myself; but I ought to ascertain their opinions, and
allow them to participate therein \[*i.e.* in the management\]." He
intended to ask his father why they were surrounding him, and said:
"This matter originated only with him, and he has not informed me
thereof; but I must ascertain this from one who can be cajoled by
promises and frightened by threats." Accordingly he turned to one \[of
his guardians\] with whom he had entertained intercourse; this and his
intimacy he augmented, and then said to him: "As thou seest, the king is
paying me visits, and the kingdom will \[in course of time\] devolve
upon me, so that thou wilt be in the happiest position if thou obeyest
me, and in the worst plight if thou opposest me either immediately or
hereafter." Then he learnt the truth from him, and placed trust in his
fidelity. Afterwards they conversed more at length, till he informed him
of everything, and he thanked him. When the time of his father's visit
arrived he said: "Dear father! Verily thou art conscious of the
incongruity of my position, and the anxiety of my soul in this
confinement! When thou wast in a similar position, thou wast not in this
state, and didst not continue therein; change, as thou seest, is
continuous." Then his father knew that his imprisonment would only
increase his discontent. He said: "My son! I wanted to ward off
calamities from thee, so that thou shouldst hear and see only <span
id="page_130">p. 130</span> what pleases thee." Then the king ordered
his courtiers to make him ride out \[from time to time\] in the
handsomest manner, and to turn away from his road every evil sight, as
also to assemble near him handsome singers. After he had been \[thus\]
riding about often, the people began to be displeased with the trouble
of removing the diseased and the cripples from his way. Accordingly they
one day made arrangements with two fellows who used to beg together for
alms. One of them was swollen, full of tumours, and of evil aspect,
lamenting violently; and the other a blind man, who urged his guide to
remove him quickly from the road. When the king's son perceived them he
was horrified at the spectacle, and asked: "Is it possible that this
befalls other men besides these two?" And the reply was affirmative,
whereon he gradually began to hate life and to think lightly of the
royal power. Afterwards he saw an old man, whom age had bent, whose hair
it had blanched, whose skin it had tanned, and changed his forces to
weakness. Then he asked: "What is this?" And was told that it is
decrepitude. He further queried: "How long does it take a man to reach
it?" They said: "A hundred years or so." He asked moreover: "And what
follows then?" And being told that death ensues, he continued: "How
quickly are days followed by months, and months by years, and years by
\[the termination of\] life; the occupation \[which we ought to follow\]
is different from that which we are engaged in." Then he departed,
repeating these words, and the wish for the enjoyment of the world and
of its lusts abandoned him.

   He met the aforesaid man with whom he had entertained intercourse and
intimacy, and asked him: "Knowest thou any persons whose position is
different from ours?" He replied: "Yes! The ascetics, who spurn the
world and seek eternity. They possess knowledge and words \[*i.e.*
tenets\], but the people are inimical to them, and the king, thy father,
has exiled them and burnt them up with fire." Thereon the king's son
became like one who is seeking something he had lost, and the fame of
his beauty, perfection, understanding, civility, knowledge, and
abstention from the world became <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> known
in distant regions, so that it reached an ascetic philosopher in the
island of *Sarandib*,<span id="page_131_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_131_note_1.md) whose name was Belavhar.
He said: "I must extricate this living man from among the dead." Then he
travelled to him, and when he reached the city in which the king's son
was, he threw away the garb of asceticism, and donned the costume of
merchants. He roamed about the gate of \[the mansion of\] the king's
son, till he made the acquaintance of the chamberlains, and used
politeness till he secretly met the aforesaid man who was familiar with
the king's son, and said to him: "I am a foreigner from Sarandib, and
have arrived with a strange and most noble article; its profit \[*i.e.*
virtue\] is that it cures the sick, causes the blind to see, and
strengthens the weak. I find no one more worthy to possess it than the
king's son, on account of his beauty and his perfection." He replied:
"Thou describest a wonderful thing, and as to thy intelligence, I see no
flaw in it, and thy words are beautiful, but I must not mention thy
information till I see thy article." He said: "Besides my trading I am
also a physician, and see that thy sight is weak; my article has a
brilliancy which cures weak sight, but the king's son is young, of
strong sight, and I shall see whether he requires this \[remedy\]." The
chamberlain then entered, and informed the king's son about him. The
soul of the king's son suggested to him that now his desire for a
knowledge of asceticism would be gratified, and he ordered him to be
secretly admitted. The philosopher Belavhar brought with him a package
containing books, and said that it was his stock-in-trade. When Belavhar
entered and the chamberlain went out, the king's son received him in the
handsomest manner, honoured him and extolled him. Then Belavhar said: "O
son of the king! I verily believe thou hast honoured me more than the
people of thy country \[have done\]." He replied: "On account of the
great \[information about asceticism\] which I hoped for on thy part."
He continued: "O son of the king! Thy parable with me <span
id="page_132">p. 132</span> is like the parable of the king who honoured
two destitute men on account of his religion."

 

*First of the Parables of Belavhar the Ascetic Philosopher.*

   The king's son asked: "And how was that?" The ascetic replied: "It is
on record that there was a king who loved what is good, and was
stimulated thereto by \[his intercourse with\] pious and excellent men.
One day, whilst he was going with his courtiers, he passed near two
barefooted men, dressed in worn-out garments, but bearing the mark of
righteousness and excellence. When he saw them, he alighted from his
vehicle \[or animal\], embraced and honoured them, which \[behaviour\]
displeased his courtiers. The king had a foolish brother who knew not
the dignity of the professors of asceticism and of devotion, but he was
under his brother and had nothing to do. The companions \[*i.e.*
courtiers\] of the excellent king then went to him and said: 'Verily the
king has despised his soul, and has exposed the people of his country to
disgrace, by alighting \[from his vehicle or horse\] for the sake of two
wretched men. Therefore reproach him, lest he repeat a similar thing
again.' He complied, and when he had terminated his address, he received
some kind of a reply, but went away without knowing whether he \[the
king\] had become angry or pleased. Some time afterwards the excellent
king commanded the herald of death to make a proclamation at the mansion
of his brother, and to beat the drum of death at the gate of his
mansion; this being the custom among them when they wished any one to be
killed. Thereon the mourning women began their lamentations in the house
of the king's brother, and the latter having put on the shroud \[of
death\] proceeded weeping to the house of his brother the excellent
king. When he came into his presence he fell on the ground, lamented,
and raised his hands for imploration. The king then said: 'What troubles
thee, O fool?' He replied: 'Blamest thou me for being troubled when thou
proclaimest my death?' He continued: 'Art thou troubled by a herald
<span id="page_133">p. 133</span> who proclaims my orders, whereas I am
thy brother, and whereas thou knowest that thou hast not so offended me
as to be deserving of death? Then how blamest thou me for being troubled
by the herald of my lord when I saw him? And thou hast fallen to the
ground, being troubled because I was reminded of that death wherewith I
have been threatened since I was born. Depart \[from me\], therefore,
because my wazirs have greatly misled thee, and their error will
\[soon\] appear.'"

 

*Parable of Four Boxes, good and bad.*

   The ascetic said: "Then the king issued orders, and four boxes were
made for him. Two of them he besmeared with gold-water, and two with
pitch; then he filled the latter with gold and jewels, but the former
with stinking carrion. Then he assembled his wazirs, exhibited to them
the boxes, and ordered them to appraise their value, but they said:
'Outwardly we perceive that we cannot assign any price to the gold-boxes
on account of their excellence, nor to the pitch-boxes on account of
their meanness.' Then he ordered the pitch-boxes to be opened, and the
house was illuminated by \[the brilliancy of\] the jewels. Then he said:
'This is the parable of the two men whom you despised on account of
their outward mean garb and destitute appearance, whereas they are full
of righteousness, wisdom, and all virtues which are superior in value to
these jewels.' Then he ordered the two gold-boxes to be opened, whereon
malodorous vapours issued from them, and the dismal, changed,
distasteful, disgusting forms having been uncovered, they turned away
from the sight, and complained of the stench. Then he said: 'This is the
parable of those adorned outwardly, who glory in these perishable
impossible bodies, whilst their internal parts are replete with folly
and wickedness, as well as with all kinds of defects which are more
deformed and more impure than this carcase.' They then said: 'Verily we
have been awakened and admonished.' And this is thy parable, a son of
the king, concerning the honourable reception <span id="page_134">p.
134</span> thou hast given me." The king's son then stood up erect and
said: "Now I am certain that I have found what I was in search of; give
me therefore more of it."

 

*Parable of the Sower.*

   The ascetic said: "The sower went forth with his good seed to sow it.
When he filled his hand therewith and sowed it, some of it fell upon the
margin of the road, so that shortly afterwards the birds snatched it
away. Some of it fell on a rock, but meeting with humidity and soil, it
sprouted; but when the roots touched the dry rock it died. Some of it
fell upon thorny ground, and when it was near bearing fruit, the thorns
overpowered and killed it; but the smallest portion of it, which had
fallen into good purified soil, was saved, became pure and prospered.
The sower is the bearer of the word, the good seed is rectitude of
speech. That which fell on the ground and was snatched away by birds, is
that which does not pass \[deeper\] beyond hearing, so that it turns
away and is lost. That which fell on a rock and withered when its roots
reached the rock, is that \[word\] which he, who received it, desired to
abide with him when it struck his ear, but he did not knot his intention
thereon \[*i.e.* he failed to retain it with a firm will\]. That which
grew, and was almost bearing fruit, but was destroyed by thistles, is
that which he who had received it retained, until the work, that is to
say the fruit thereof, was suffocated by lusts and cares and \[thus\]
destroyed; but that which remained safe, pure, and prospered, is that
which was accepted by the ear and the eye, and retained by the
understanding and memory, was cherished by firm resolution, reflection
and judgment, so that no associate \[other impression\] obtained
obtained a share therein."<span id="page_134_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_134_note_1.md) The king's son said: "I
hope that my case will be that of the seed which remains safe, is pure,
and prospers. Then narrate to me the parable of the <span
id="page_135">p. 135</span> world and the beguilement of the denizens
thereof, and what their purpose is."

 

*Parable of the Elephant and the Man.*

   'The ascetic said: "It is related that a man went out into the
desert, and that whilst he was progressing, an elephant in rut attacked
him. He ran, but, being followed by the elephant, and perceiving a well,
he let himself down into it, hanging on to two branches which had grown
on its margin, and placing his two feet upon something at the side of
this well. When he clearly saw the two branches, he \[also\] perceived
near them two rats, black and white, gnawing them incessantly. Then he
glanced at what he had placed his feet upon, and lo! he beheld four
serpents. Then looking into the depth of the well, he beheld a dragon
with dilated mouth, desirous of swallowing him. Then he \[again\] raised
his head towards the two branches, and lo! there was some bee-honey upon
them, whereon he consumed some, and the enjoyment of the sweetness of
the honey diverted his attention from \[looking further at\] the two
branches on which he was suspended, but \[afterwards\] he took notice of
the two rats who were hastening to cut \[through\] them, as well as of
the four serpents, upon which his feet were resting, not knowing at what
moment one of them might attack him, and the dragon with distended
mouth, not knowing how he would fare in case he should fall into his
jaws, and of the bees and the wasps which stung him whilst he was eating
that honey. The well is the world, full of calamities, the two branches
are \[human\] life, the two rats are night and day, and their haste in
cutting through the two branches is the rapidity of \[the succession\]
of days and nights in cutting away life. The serpents are the four
temperaments, and when one of them is exorbitant, it kills; and the
dragon is impending death, and the bees and wasps are misfortunes and
calamities; and the honey is the beguilement of human beings in the
world—by their slender enjoyment therein of the pleasure of life
commingled with troubles and <span id="page_136">p. 136</span>
difficulties—resembles the honey mixed with the stinging of wasps and of
bees." The son of the king said: "The parable is wonderful, and the
similitude true; give me, therefore, another parable of the world, with
its adherent beguiled therein by what does not profit him, \[but\]
despising that by which profit redounds to him.<span
id="page_136_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_136_note_1.md)"

 

*The Man who had Three Friends.*

   The ascetic said: "It is on record that there was a man who had three
friends. As to the first, he preferred him \[to the other two\] and
honoured him with his soul by fighting for him. The second was inferior
to the first, but he loved him and did not neglect him; and the third,
being despised and degraded by him, he occupied himself very little with
him. A calamity having befallen the man, he stood in need of his friends
therein, and messengers of the king had arrived to take him away. He
then went to his first companion, and said to him: 'Thou art indeed
aware how I prefer thee \[to my other two friends\], and I have spent my
life for thee. This is the day of my necessity; what then may I expect
from thee?' He replied: 'I have friends who occupy \[and avert\] me from
thee, and they are now preferable to thee; moreover I have clothed thee
with two garments \[utilization of wealth for this and for the next
world ??\], of which thou makest no use.' Then he paid a visit to his
second friend, and said: 'I relieve thy want, and strive to gain thy
approbation, but \[now\] I am in need of thee; then what may I hope from
thee?' He replied: 'My own affairs engage \[and impede\] me from
\[aiding\] thee to-day; and verily our connection is severed, since thy
way differs from mine, I shall \[however\] side with \[or accompany\]
thee a few steps, and then \[I shall\] depart to what is more profitable
to me than thyself.' Then he turned towards his <span id="page_137">p.
137</span> third friend, and said to him: 'I am ashamed \[to ask\] of
thee, but necessity has driven me to thee; then what may I expect from
thee?' He replied: 'Thou hast a deposit with me, and I am under
obligations to thee, and thy neglect of me is of little account, for I
am thy friend who will neither abandon nor surrender thee; be therefore
not dismayed on account of the smallness of what thou hast paid me
beforehand, because I have guarded it, augmented it for thee, and then
left it at thy disposal. Of the small amount of property \[or rather
money\] thou hast laid up with me, the double of what thou hast
deposited with me \[now\] belongs to thee; and I hope that thereby the
king will be propitiated towards thee.' The man then said: 'I do not
know which of the two things I am to be sorry for, my nearness to a bad
companion or my remoteness from a true companion.' The first companion
is wealth, the second the family, and the third good works." The king's
son said: "This is the truth, then give me more of it."

 

*The Foreign King.*

   The ascetic said: 'The people of a \[certain\] town were in the habit
of appointing a man who was a stranger to them and ignorant of their
affairs to be their king, and expelling him after one year in a state of
nudity, so that what elapsed of his royal affairs \[or honours\] became
\[the occasion of\] calamity to him. One of them \[who had thus been
made king\], when he perceived that he was \[destined to remain\] a
stranger among the people of the town, sought no intercourse \[or
familiarity\] with them, but endeavoured to find one of his own
countrymen, or \[some other person\] who might inform him about their
affairs and customs. He ceased not to search everywhere till he found
one who revealed to him their secret, and hinted to him to accumulate at
once as much as he could, so as to find it after his expulsion.<span
id="page_137_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_137_note_1.md) He did so, and the
termination \[of his reign\] was for his own <span id="page_138">p.
138</span> good. Thou also, O son of the king, art situated like that
foreigner who wished to have no intercourse with those who were
strangers to him, and I am the man who had been sought, and from whom
thou wilt obtain direction and assistance." The king's son said: "I am a
recluse in the world; then inform me on the state of eternity." The
ascetic said: "Verily seclusion in \[or rather from\] the world is the
key to \[the\] desire for eternity; and who desires eternity seeks it,
and who seeks it finds the gate thereof, and who arrives at the gate
thereof enters the kingdom thereof, and who enters the kingdom thereof
enjoys the benefits thereof.<span id="page_138_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_138_note_1.md) And how shouldst thou
not be a recluse in the world when thou beholdest upon this body its
influence which cannot be avoided, because heat melts it, cold freezes
it, water drowns it, fire burns it, reptiles injure it, beasts of prey
tear it to pieces, iron cuts it, and hard substances knocking against it
break it, whilst disease and pain are by nature inherent therein;
neither is there any expectation of its continuous health or immunity,
it being moreover subject to \[endure\] heat, cold, disease, fear,
hunger, thirst, and death." The king's son asked: "Were those thy
friends whom my father had exiled and burnt?" And receiving an
affirmative reply, he continued: "I was informed that the people
gathered around against them with \[or on account of their\] enmity and
evil speaking \[or bad repute\]." The ascetic said: "As to enmity it is
\[all\] very well; but as to evil speaking \[or bad repute\] can it \[or
the accusation of it\] be applied to one who is veracious and lies not,
who knows and is not ignorant, who is satisfied with the smallest
competency of everything, who abandons his property and family, who
injures neither himself nor others; of whom no persons entertain fears
that he will injure them or their families or their possessions." "Then
how did the people agree to be their enemies whilst they disagree \[in
many things\] among themselves?" He <span id="page_139">p. 139</span>
replied: "In the same manner as dogs gather around carrion \[and agree
in\] biting it, but bite \[also\] each other, and bark at it, although
they are of various statures and colours. Whilst they are fighting with
each other for carrion, and a man happens to pass near them, they
abandon each other and all rush upon the man, aiding each other against
him, although he does not want their carrion, but they dislike him
because he is a stranger to them, and they associate with each other.
The carrion is the wealth of the world, and the various dogs which are
fighting with each other for it are various kinds of men, who entertain
no other care but \[for the enjoyments of\] the world. The man around
whom the dogs assembled, who has no need of the carrion, is the ascetic
who does not struggle with anyone in \[the affairs of\] the world, and
the people do not forbid this \[indifference\] because he is a stranger
to them. And what more powerful argument is there \[against the
unreasonableness of this persecution\] than that people at variance aid
each other to assail him against whom no argument \[of unworthiness\] is
adduced by knowing men?" The king's son said: "Execute thy purpose and
treat me with thy medicines." The ascetic continued: "When a skilled
physician sees a man's body worn out by lusts, by corrupt humours, and
he desires to strengthen and to fatten it, he does not begin with food
which produces flesh and strength, because he is aware that the mixing
of strong food with corrupt humours is insalubrious to the body, but he
treats him with what will destroy his corrupt humours, and purify his
veins \[*i.e.* blood\], whereon he nourishes him with suitable food and
drink; then he will become strong \[enough\] to bear the \[food which
is\] heavy." The king's son asked: "Is that to which you are inviting me
a thing which men attain by means of their intellects, so that they have
chosen it in preference to something else?" The ascetic then said:
"Verily this matter is too great to be an affair of the people of the
earth, or that they should plan it by their own thought. If it were a
thought of men of the world, it would be an invitation to its practices
and ornaments, such as its food, drink, clothing, <span id="page_140">p.
140</span> accumulations, buildings, sports, and lusts; but it is a
matter foreign thereto, and violating \[the usages\] thereof." He asked:
"Does any one invite to this \[asceticism\] besides yourself?" He
replied: "Yes! Religious people in all nations." The king's son queried
further: "Then what has given you \[ascetics\] the preference \[or
superiority\] in this matter \[of the invitation\] to others?" He
continued: "The origin \[or principle\] of the invitation is the truth
alone,<span id="page_140_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_140_note_1.md) but the difference
between us and between others is that this invitation ceased \[or
failed\] to arrive and to appear upon earth with the prophets of Allah
and His apostles during past ages \[and has been promulgated\] in
various languages. Every invitation is a direction \[or guidance\] and
\[has\] a correct purpose \[or command\], but the nations turn it away
from its aim, and abandon the intention of its path, and continue to
adhere to its name \[only, but\] pretend to understand it; and this
constitutes the separation between us and them. We do not oppose any
one, in any thing, unless we possess an argument against him \[which we
quote\] from the remnant of the \[sacred\] books \[which are still\] in
his hands, and from the sentiments which be utters. Our behaviour
testifies that we are in accordance with the truth, and their behaviour
testifies against them that they are in opposition \[thereto\]." He
further asked: "Then how is it that when prophets and apostles arrive,
then they are cut off, so that their vestiges become obliterated, and
their sciences are ignored?" He replied: "Seest thou not the owner of
the garden, how he establishes various plants therein, then hedges in
every species of them, and enters it during some time only seldom; but
when the vernal season is at hand he visits it, and proceeds to the side
where his business is? The same is the case with the prophets and the
apostles, because they come for the scope to which they have been
ordered by Allah the great and glorious; and every season has its scope;
the flower has one and the fruit another." He asked: "Do they proceed
\[only\] to those of their scope, or do they <span id="page_141">p.
141</span> deliver a universal invitation, so that some accept it, and
some who do not love them reject it? It seems they do not know those who
respond to them, obey them, and are under their patronage \[or
government\]." The ascetic said: "Listen to the parable which I shall
narrate to thee."

 

*Parable of the Bird, compared to the Prophets.*

   "It is said that on a certain coast of the sea there is a bird which
lays many eggs; but a time arrives when it becomes difficult to him to
dwell on the said coast, and he finds no means of subsistence \[except\]
in another region, until the said time elapses. Accordingly he takes up
his eggs and distributes them in the nests of \[other\] birds, egg by
egg among the eggs of every species of birds. Then the birds cherish his
eggs with their own, and his little ones come out with theirs, till the
time of his return arrives, when he passes near those nests in the night
and gives forth sounds which his little ones and others hear, but only
his own gather around him when they hear his voice, the other birds not
responding to him. The same is the case with the prophets and the
apostles, because their invitation is responded to only by the people
who belong to them." He asked: "If then thou art of opinion that the
words of apostles are not like the words of \[other\] men; are they the
words of Allah and his angels, or of others?" He replied: "Seest thou
not that when people desire some beast or bird to understand that it is
to advance, to retreat, to meet, or to back out, they find that beasts
and birds cannot bear \[*i.e.* understand\] their actual words; and
place upon them \[*i.e.* communicate with them by means of\] such
threats and signs which they are able to bear \[*i.e.* to understand\],
by means of which they attain their purpose with them. In the same
manner, when men were too weak to bear \[*i.e.* to understand\] the
words of Allah and of his angels, according to their \[actual\] form,
perfection, and quality, sounds \[*i.e.* expressions\] were delivered
\[to them\] which they return to \[*i.e.* use\] among themselves, by
means of which they listen to words of <span id="page_142">p. 142</span>
wisdom, through \[the medium\] of tongues of flesh, like the sounds of
whistling or threatening which are addressed by men to beasts. ln the
same manner the spirit of wisdom is concealed in those sounds; and as
words, when they contain the wisdom of Allah, are ennobled on account of
the nobleness thereof, so bodies are ennobled by spirits, and as bodies
void of spirits are useless, so from words when they are void of wisdom,
which stands in the place of spirits, no profit can be derived." He
asked: "How is it that this wisdom, of whose force and excellence thou
hast given some account, is not profitable to all mankind?"

 

*Parable of the Sun of Hearts and of Eyes.<span
id="page_142_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_142_note_1.md)*

   The ascetic said: "Verily the light of wisdom is like two suns rising
together; their light striking the faces of all mankind, the blind and
the seeing. When the evident \[conspicuous\] sun rises \[*i.e.* is
visible\] to conspicuous eyesights, it causes a division of men into
three stations: one of them possesses good sight, to which the
brilliancy is profitable, and which is strengthened by looking thereat;
whilst another of them is blind, \[remaining\] a stranger to the
brilliancy, who does not at all profit by the rising of the sun; and one
of them has a diseased sight, who is accounted neither among the blind
nor those of sound sight; he profits by the brilliancy according to the
measure of his eyesight, and will be injured hy the brilliancy according
to the measure of the weakness of his eyes. Thus also the sun of wisdom,
which is the sun of hearts, when it shines upon hearts, causes a
division of them into three stations. The station of those endowed with
sight \[*i.e.* judgment\] is, that they act according to wisdom, and
honour the adherents thereof by choosing it, trusting in it, acting
according to its requirements, spending their time in learning what they
have not \[yet\] learnt of it, and in practising what they have <span
id="page_143">p. 143</span> not \[yet\] practised of it. The position of
those who are blind \[*i.e.* undiscerning\] is, that in which the
relation of their hearts to wisdom resembles that of a blind eye to the
sun; whilst the state of those with diseased hearts is that where
knowledge \[or theory\] is deficient and practice weak; good and evil,
truth and vanity, being accumulated therein. And the difference between
these two suns is, that most of those to whom the internal sun has
risen, with its charms, are blind to it. In every stage of the stages of
internal vision there is a difference as in the grains of pearls, and
although all are called by one name there is nevertheless much
difference between them." The king's son asked: "Is there \[any\]
salvation for the defective \[or guilty\]?" He replied: "Verily there is
deliverance \[or manumission\] in liberation \[or emancipation\] from
folly and error, and there is salvation<span
id="page_143_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_143_note_1.md) in adherence to the
protection of wisdom, and a portion thereof not falling \[away or lost\]
is something, even if it be little." He asked: "Thinkest thou my father
has heard anything of these words \[or tenets\]?" He replied: "I am of
opinion that the information was not given to him." He \[further\]
asked: "How have the philosophers failed to do so, and have not spoken
to him on this important subject, and advised him?" He replied: "Because
they knew the \[unwillingness of the\] recipient of their words; thus,
perhaps, some philosopher may associate with an ignorant man all his
life, and be loved by him, there being no difference between them except
in \[matters of\] belief; he is nevertheless pained \[*i.e.* reluctant\]
towards him, and does not think proper to open out \[*i.e.* to reveal\]
to him the secrets of wisdom when he does not consider him worthy, as
was the case with the prosperous king and his sage wazir."

 

*The Prosperous King and his Sage Wazir.*

   "We are informed that there was a righteous king, and that he had a
wazir who encouraged him to righteousness. <span id="page_144">p.
144</span> The wazir had indeed heard tenets of wisdom, understood them,
responded to them, and segregated himself \[from others\] to the
adherents thereof. The king was keeping nothing secret from him, and
likewise the wazir hid nothing from him, except the subject of the
\[Buddhist ?\] religion and of wisdom. They lived together in this way
for a long time, and whenever the wazir saw the king prostrating himself
to his idols, making offerings to them, and behaving himself according
to the behaviour \[peculiar to the adherents\] of their aberration, he
became pensive, sad, and consulted his \[Buddhist ?\] companions whether
he ought to speak to him on this \[subject\]. They replied: 'Thou
knowest thy companion \[*i.e.* the king\] best, and if thou thinkest him
to be a \[worthy\] recipient of the tenets \[of Buddhism ?\], then speak
to him; but if not, take care not to direct him to the religion \[of
Buddha\] and its professors, for the Sulṭân will be vexed thereby.' He
continued: On a certain night when the people were resting—and in those
days there was a great rain—the king said to the wazir: 'Art thou
willing that we should walk about the town to see the state of the
population, and the effect of the rain which we have had in these days?'
He replied: 'Yes, if thou art so inclined.' Accordingly they roamed
about in various directions of the town, and passed in a certain road
near a heap of dung, belonging to the inhabitants of the town, which had
grown to be a big hill, and the king perceived the brilliancy of a fire
issuing from its side. He then said to the wazir: 'Come down with us;
let us walk so that we may look at this fire closely, and know its
knowledge \[*i.e.* what it may reveal\].' When they reached it \[*i.e.*
the dung-heap\] they observed therein an excavation resembling a cave,
which a poor mendicant had excavated and made a habitation for himself
and his wife. Hearing sounds of song, both then looked from such a spot
so that they could not be perceived from the cavern, and lo! they beheld
a man of ugly aspect reclining on that \[couch\] which he had prepared
for himself of garbage. He wore a garment of rags \[taken\] from the
dunghill, and before him he had the fragment of <span id="page_145">p.
145</span> an earthen bowl \[which had been\] thrown \[away by some
person\] on the said dunghill, but it contained a beverage. In his hand
he held a bone, cast away from corpses, and he had tied thereon a skin
belonging to the same, so as to resemble a drum. His wife was standing
in front of him, her aspect and dress being the same as his own. She was
serving him with drink, and whenever she addressed him, she addressed
him as *Prince of men*, and when he spoke to her, he addressed her as
*Princess of women*. There was among them gaiety, laughter, excitement,
and more mutual dalliance than can be expressed,<span
id="page_145_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_145_note_1.md) so that the king was
astonished at the condition they were in, and the delight they enjoyed.
Then they departed, but his amazement had not ceased concerning what
they had both seen, and he said to his wazir: 'I do not know that we
\[ever\] enjoyed gaiety and delight such as we have seen with these two
poor persons, and I think they will be continuing in this manner all
night.' The wazir then took up the \[subject of the\] conversation after
the king, and said: 'O king! I fear that we are as beguiled as they
are!' He asked: 'How can that be?' The wazir continued: 'Because to
those who know the everlasting kingdom a \[terrestrial\] kingdom is as
this locality \[which we have just seen\] is to our eyes; and to those
who hope for the mansions of eternal beatitude, thy mansions will appear
as this cave \[appears\] to our eyes, and they will be astonished at the
beauty and perfection \[of all things\] which thou enjoyest, as we are
amazed at what these two destitute persons are imagining in their minds
\[that they are enjoying\].' The king asked: 'And who are \[men\] of
this description, and what do they describe concerning the everlasting
kingdom?' The wazir replied: 'They are those who know Allah and seek
eternity, \[namely\] the mansion of <span id="page_146">p. 146</span>
joy wherewith grief neither exists nor follows \[or enters\] it, but
repose not fraught with fatigue, and light which is not followed by
darkness, and knowledge not commingled with ignorance, and love not
accompanied by hate; and content, and security, neither of which is
coupled with wrath nor fear, and \[whatever is\] beautiful or pleasant,
without any admixture of baseness or decay in either; health and life,
followed neither by sickness nor by death, perfect immunity from all
evils, and the plenitude of everything good.' The king asked: 'And do
they record that there is any desire or any way to \[attain\] this
abode?' He replied: 'Yes; they do not doubt that he who seeks it enters
it.' He asked: 'Then why hast thou not informed me of this before
to-day?' The wazir replied: 'Because the Sulṭân is blind to this
\[subject\] and deaf. Blindness and deafness incite him to anger and
impetuosity, intervening between him and between meditation and
deliberation. His heart is occupied with various cares, near and
distant; his audition is engaged with pleasant forgotten stories and
gossip; his vision with extravagant colours and figures.' The king said:
'If this be true, we must not employ our nights and days, nor desire the
use of our hearing and sight, in anything but this \[subject\], and if
there be a doubt, it is incumbent on us to occupy ourselves with
searching for a knowledge thereof, until we know whether it be true or
false. And I am of opinion that thy concealing of this subject from me
was not handsome, because I was trusting in thy affection, and
considered thy \[allegations of\] excuse to be true.' The wazir said:
'Verily there is a close relationship between the beginning and the end
of this subject \[of asceticism\], since both he who knows it, and he
who is ignorant of it, \[may\] agree to abandon its precepts and to work
for the world which is \[or means\] enmity to eternity; wherefore I have
acted \[thus, all\] this time in not informing thee, from compassion
towards, and from fear of, thee; like the swimmer towards his friend,
who knew not how to swim, when he fell into the overwhelming water.'

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

 

*The Swimmer and his Friend.*

   He \[*i.e.* the king\] asked: 'How was this?' He \[*i.e.* the wazir\]
replied: 'We have been informed that there were two intimate friends,
one of whom was a swimmer, but the other possessed no knowledge of the
art of swimming, nor boldness to venture into water; both however
happened to fall into deep water. The swimmer then swam to save himself
from drowning, and looking at his companion found him \[alternately\]
sinking and rising in the water. When he perceived his ignorance of
swimming, and the small chance of \[saving\] his life, the desire for
the preservation \[of his friend\] impelled him to approach him, but he
dared not go very near, for fear he might catch hold of him, and they
would both be drowned. He therefore began to show him how he was working
with his hands, in order to direct him; he accordingly moved his hands
in a similar manner; whereon, hoping to rescue him, he endangered his
own life by approaching him so as to enable him to take hold of his
hand. Then he swam with him till both of them came out \[of the water\]
and were saved. In the same manner, O king, I have endangered my life in
this \[matter\] with thee, although I was aware of thy strength and of
my weakness; but when I saw that the opportunity was suitable, I spoke
to thee about it. Then wilt thou permit me to remind thee of these
words?' He replied: 'Yes! Always! ' The wazir accordingly did so, and
the end thereof was unto salvation."

   The king's son continued: "I do not occupy my mind with anything
besides this path, and I am firmly determined to flee in the night with
thee." The ascetic queried: "How canst thou come with me, whereas I
possess no beast to carry me, neither gold nor silver; have not provided
food, nor habitation, and wish to remain only a short time in the
country. How couldst thou habituate thyself to the society of those who
are like the dead?" The king's son asked: "How likenest thou them to the
dead?" He replied: "Because they have deadened their animal lives, they
rejoice at physical death." The king's son said: "The worshippers <span
id="page_148">p. 148</span> of idols also pretend that they have, like
the ascetics, prevailed over \[the fear of\] death, but they drink and
eat as the ascetics eat and drink; then what is the argument in this
matter?"

 

*The Sparrow and the Fowler.<span id="page_148_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_148_note_1.md)*

   The ascetic said: "It is recorded that a certain man had charge of a
garden. When he entered it on the customary day he had appointed for the
purpose, he beheld a sparrow perched on a tree, the fruit of which it
was plundering. He therefore set a snare for it, captured it, and when
he was about to slay it, the bird said: 'There is nothing in me to
satiate thee. Wouldst thou prefer to do something better than what thou
intendest?' He asked: 'And what is it?' The sparrow replied: 'Let me go
my way, and I shall teach thee three maxims, which, if thou rememberest
them, will be better for thee than all thou possessest.' The man said:
'I agree; then inform me of them.' It said: '\[Not\] till thou swearest
to set me \[first\] at liberty.' He accordingly did so. It then said:
'Do not fall into despair for what thou hast lost; seek not what thou
canst not attain; and do not believe in \[a thing\] which will not be.'
Then he let go the bird, which flew away, perched on a branch; and said
to the man: 'If thou hadst known what thou hast lost in me, thou wouldst
be aware that thou hast been deprived of a great thing.' He asked: 'What
is it?' It replied: 'If thou hadst slain me, thou wouldst have found in
my gizzard a pearl like a goose egg, and wouldst have enjoyed \[much
pleasure for\] the price of it all thy life.' When the man heard this,
he repented of having set it free, and in order to decoy it, spoke as
follows: 'Let bygones be bygones, remain in my company and do not
abandon thy place, because we are under obligations to each other.' The
sparrow then said: 'O fool! I see thou hast not remembered the \[three\]
maxims, and hast not retained me when I fell into thy hands; for <span
id="page_149">p. 149</span> now thou grievest on account of having lost
me, and wantest my return, which thou canst not attain; and thou
\[also\] believest in \[a thing\] which cannot be, because my gizzard is
the smallest \[part\] of what is in me, whereas the egg \[of a goose\]
is greater than me.' And this nation of yours, O son of the king, have
manufactured their idols with their own hands, but believe that they
were created by them. They have guarded them for fear of being stolen;
they nevertheless say that they are guarded by them. They spend upon
them their gains, and believe that they are provided for by them. Thus
they have sought what cannot be attained, and have believed in what will
not be. But as to thy assertion that we eat, drink, and clothe ourselves
like them, \[I state that\] our eating is imposed upon us by necessity,
like eating the flesh of corpses, in the same manner as the king who was
besieged by his foe in a cave on the seashore, with his wives and
children. They had been long in the place, unable to escape, and had no
provisions. One of them having died, and they being ready to perish \[of
starvation\], they did this \[*i.e.* consumed the corpse\]. Thinkest
thou they ate the food of necessity or of appetite?" He replied: "Yea!
the food of extreme necessity." He continued: "This is the difference
between our eating and their eating, because we eat to avert necessity
and unwillingly, whereas they eat with appetite and not by compulsion."
The king's son said: "As to the idols, I do not cease to hate them, as I
despair of their \[being anything\] good. Then inform me what the first
thing is thou invitest me to, in \[the articles of\] the religion?" He
then replied: "Two things, namely, a knowledge of Allah, and practising
what pleases Him." He asked: "How am I to know Him?" He replied: "Thou
must know Him by the unity, by the power, and by His justice, His
greatness and knowledge of all things \[*i.e.* omniscience\], and by His
exaltation above all things."<span id="page_149_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_149_note_1.md) He <span
id="page_150">p. 150</span> asked: "And what is the indication to all
this?" The philosopher replied: "Thinkest thou not that when thou
beholdest a made thing, thou knowest that it has a maker, although he
may be absent from thee? In the same manner thou knowest Him in what
thou seest of these made things, \[such as\] the sky, the earth, the
sun, the moon, the stars, the revolving of the spheres, the flowing of
the water, the motion of the wind, of fire, and the design of all
created things, that they have a powerful, wise creator, and he is the
Most High, the Great." He asked: "Then what will please Him in us?" He
replied: "That every one should do to another what he loves that he
should do to him, and that he should abstain from doing to him what he
would like another to abstain from doing to him.<span
id="page_150_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_150_note_1.md) Herein is righteousness,
and in righteousness towards Allah the righteous \[man\] is \[also\]
pleased." He said: "Verily, now thou hast made me acquainted with the
deficiency in the religion of idols, and with the position \[of myself
therein ?\], which is not correct." "Verily, the position in any other
except the religion of Allah will not expand \[*i.e.* be of advantage
to\] thee." He asked: "And what hinders my position \[*i.e.*
continuation\] in any other, and constricts that upon me?" He rejoined:
"Ignorance and knowledge." He asked: "Then what is the constriction of
ignorance, and what is the expansion \[*i.e.* advantage\] of knowledge?"
He said: "Knowledge is wealth, and wealth is expansion; ignorance is
poverty, and poverty is constriction." He asked: "And what demonstrates
this \[opinion\]?" He replied: "Perceivest thou not that thy breast is
constricted by thy ignorance of anything asked for, and that thou hopest
for relief \[of the constriction\] only in the attainment of the
knowledge thereof?" He rejoined: "Verily I have seen persons hoping for
relief \[from things\] wherein no relief is, and I am not sure whether I
am not one of them." He continued: "Shall I show thee and inform thee of
this idea, and terrify thee concerning <span id="page_151">p. 151</span>
the position of those who entertain it, \[contrary to those\] who do not
entertain it?" He replied: "Only that could frighten me thereat." He
said: "Thou hast certainly heard paradise and \[hell\] fire mentioned,
and although they possess a meaning assigned to a real thing, they would
have no names \[unless they existed in nature?\]" He \[the king's son\]
rejoined: "If a speaker desires to produce a meaningless oration, he can
do it; and the poet has said:

Many a vain story is reasonable.

If therefore thou compellest me to believe all that is reasonable, thou
forcest me to believe liars \[also, because their lies may be
reasonable\]." He replied: "Verily, I compel thee to believe isolated
words not concocted by the compositions of liars." The king's son said:
"Thou hast of a certainty forced me to the belief in Allah, and what
came \[or was revealed\] from him about rewards and punishments, and I
shall prepare myself for reclusion in \[*i.e.* from\] the world." The
ascetic replied: "Not everybody is fit for reclusion therein, because it
is a prison to the righteous and a paradise to the wicked. And why
should one not be a recluse therein who knows that the benefits of
eternity cannot be enjoyed except by liberation from the bonds of the
world; because there is a contrast in these two abodes, the building of
the one being the destruction of the other. The expansions and benefits
of eternity are, that the way to it is easy, and the gates of it are
open to every one who travels on the road to it; whereas the
constrictions and blemishes \[*i.e.* disadvantages\] of the world are,
that \[happiness in\] it is unattainable to the majority of those who
seek it, and that those who love it are more wretched than those who
reject it, so that the slave thereof may perhaps attain more \[of the
prosperity\] thereof by opposing \[the allurements of\] it; because it
resembles a thirst-producing desert, full of beasts of prey, greedy
thieves, reprobate satans, rapacious ghouls, and scorching simooms; its
waters are lethal poison, and its plants \[are like\] the tree of death.
In its centre there is a garden with an enclosure which cannot be
scaled, and a strong gate. It contains fruitful trees and shady waters.
Thus \[it may be <span id="page_152">p. 152</span> seen that\] after the
said thirst-exciting desert, there is on one side of it fertility, and
cultivation, and friendliness \[of locality\], whilst on the other side
of it there is a sea of poison, over which the simoom of fire blows; nor
is there any other issue from the said desert, except by these two ways
\[*i.e.* the barren and the fertile\]. This desert is the adumbration of
the world, with the changes and troubles contained therein. The garden
in the centre of it represents the few pleasures which are therein
commingled with calamities and miseries. The cultivation and fertility
at one of its sides is like the reversed position \[*i.e.* happiness\]
of the righteous in the next world, and the sea of poison is the
reversed position \[*i.e.* misery\] of the wicked in eternity."

   The philosopher Belavhar \[thus\] continued to pay visits to the
king's son during four months, preaching to him and teaching him. After
that Belavhar informed the son of the king that a festival of his, and
of his companions, being at hand, he desired to go out to them, in order
to be present thereat with them. The king's son replied: "I shall go out
with thee." But Belavhar rejoined: "Verily, thy going out with me will
irritate the king against me and against my companions, and will induce
him to injure the adherents of asceticism, and our joy at their being
with us will be marred, and thine at being with us; so that thou wouldst
be cut off from thy purpose, which thou wilt attain in the joy \[of
having become an ascetic\] with the permission of Allah, by the
benignity \[of thy compliance with the warning I just gave thee\],
inasmuch as thy remaining with the king will keep him off from
\[injuring\] the adherents of the \[Buddhist ?\] religion, which is
\[accounted as\] worship to thee \[or as a merit for protecting
ascetics\]. Though we entertain no aversion to death, we dislike to aid
\[the king\] against ourselves \[*i.e.* to get us into his power\]." He
asked: "Where have you assembled?" He replied: "In a fertile plain." He
asked: "Of what kind is your food?" He continued: "Of its plants and
vegetables, which are not the property of any one. But as to gardens, or
fields, or cattle, or sheep, we hove none of these \[things\]." He
continued: "Take in <span id="page_153">p. 153</span> thy provision-bag
some property \[or money ?\] for thy companions." He rejoined: "How
could my companions be misguided by property; for I should be a wretched
ambassador to them, if I were to come bringing to them \[goods\] of the
world, which they have been verily struggling against till they have
overcome it. Thus I would come to them as a foe, and renovate their
lust. They have no need to meet an enemy, reminding them of the vanity
of the world, because an enemy thereof is an enemy to poverty and
destruction, whereas if they do not return thereto, what else are gold
and jewels but various kinds of stones, for which we have no need in our
\[fertile\] plain." He asked: "Then whence do you obtain clothes?" He
replied: "These are one of our difficulties, and when we find a garment,
we hope that it may be the last of our requirements from the world, and
it compels us to have recourse to the adherents thereof." He said: "Then
take a robe which thou mayest use \[or give away\]." He rejoined: "We do
not renew garments until they are worn out, nor are we in haste to
accumulate any for a day which we do not know whether we shall attain it
or not." He asked: "Then whence hast thou this garment?" He replied:
"This is a shell to which Satan is accustomed; I have assumed it to meet
thee." Then he asked him to show him his dress, whereon he doffed the
shell from a black skin stretched over an emaciated trunk \[his body
having such a black and lean appearance\], and he \[the king's son\]
felt pity when he beheld on his body the traces of devotion. He then
said: "Accept from me a garment for thy body." He rejoined: "How could I
accept for myself what I have declined \[to accept\] for my companions
from affection for them; and, if it were proper, I would have procured
them the benefit thereof." He continued: "Then leave with me these
clothes of thine, and take others instead of them, because I should like
to possess a pledge to keep from thee." He replied: "My wish to exchange
something old for something new will extend my hopes in proportion of
the time which each lasts. Then let it be so, but wilt thou give me a
garment resembling it in decay?" Then he called for one <span
id="page_154">p. 154</span> of his own garments, which he \[the
ascetic\] took, and gave him a pledge \[or promise\] that he would
return to him before the expiration of the year, in case he should not
die or be overcome \[or hindered by some accident\]. He agreed, took
leave of him, gave him his best wishes, and he \[the ascetic\] departed.

   The king's son then secretly addicted himself to devotion, removed
his clothes in the night, and donning the said \[worn-out\] garment \[of
the ascetic Belavhar\] prayed therein till morning. The confidential
servant of the king to \[watch over\] his son, being displeased with the
access of Belavhar to the king's son, made use of a stratagem, and
informed the king thereof, who then became very angry and sorrowful, but
afterwards had recourse to gentleness \[or delay\] on account of what he
hoped \[to accomplish\] by \[the use of\] cunning towards his son. He
accordingly summoned to his presence an interpreter of dreams, \[who was
also\] a sorcerer, and said: "We have been afflicted by the sting
against which we had not ceased to be on our guard, and which we had
feared concerning our son; then what is the advice?" The sorcerer
replied: "The first advice is to call this man, namely Belavhar, and if
we get hold of him, thou wilt strike him with our argument against the
professors of asceticism, because they abstain from the food wherewith
Allah has bountifully provided them to partake thereof, and to be
thankful for it; and because they have cut themselves off from progeny,
whereby alone the earth is made habitable, and the praise of Allah is
augmented. If we thus attain what will turn the king's son \[away from
asceticism\], and what will make him acquainted with his error, we shall
have accomplished our purpose, or else we shall reprove him. Then I
shall assume the form of the ascetic \[by means of my sorcery ?\], in
such a manner that the king's son will deny nothing of the covenant of
his friend \[and will not doubt that I am Belavhar\]. Then I shall
address him in his own language \[according to his own ascetic tenets\],
by showing him the falseness thereof, and making him confess his
aberration in his pretensions to abandon the cultivation <span
id="page_155">p. 155</span> \[or society\] of the world, and verily this
will be his medicine \[or rather cure from asceticism\], unless thou art
of \[a different\] opinion." Accordingly the king issued a command . . .
.

   \[Here the MS. breaks off in the middle of the sentence.\]

 

   The opinion of Dr. Fritz Hommel as to the manner of the probable
termination of this MS., if the end of it had not been lost, is as
follows:

   On the leaf (or leaves) that are wanting the information would have
been given, how the king intended to get hold of Belavhar and could not
find him, but had instead of him captured another ascetic, and caused
him to be tortured; and how then the sorcerer's second advice was
executed, and the false Belavhar (namely the sorcerer himself) was then
introduced to the prince; how then, furthermore, instead of the false
ascetic having been able to confound the prince, the latter, on the
contrary, had converted the sorcerer to asceticism; how also a second
sorcerer (in the Christian romance Theudas, surmised to be Devadatta in
the Indian), who desires to seduce the prince by spectral appearances of
beautiful women, is likewise by him led to a similar internal
transformation; and how them, at last, the king gives to his son
one-half of his kingdom, hoping thereby again to turn him to worldly
thoughts; how the prince accepts it, but immediately after his father's
death surrenders it to another man, in order entirely to withdraw
himself into the desert, where he at last finds Belavhar again, and
becomes after continuous asceticism and penance a real Buddha.

that this declaration is entirely in the Buddhist sense, who do not
require Allah—and only long to attain the *Nirvâna* which may perhaps be
meant by the "kingdom of eternity" mentioned above—but He will also be
alluded to afterwards; as also prophets, but none of them are specified
by names or the religions they preached.

<span id="page_145_note_1"></span>[1](#page_145_fr_1.md) The so-called
dung-heap was a place of cremation, the prince and princess a *Mehter*
and *Mehtvani*, as all who are acquainted with India will readily admit;
but of course, under the British Government, even the places of
cremation have fallen under sanitary regulations and police supervision,
so that the above description is not quite so faithful in our days as it
was in ancient times. The Buddhists called a place of cremation simply a
*heap*, so it is perhaps not surprising that our Arabic text calls it a
*dung-heap*.
