<P ALIGN="center">ART. IX.--<I>Translation of a Burmese Version of the Niti Kyan</I>, a Code of Ethics in Pali. By E. FOWLE, Esq.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[<I>Read</I> 20<I>th November</I>, 1858.]</P>

<P>THE work that I am about to read is called the Niti Kyan, signifying "a sacred writing."<SUP><SMALL>[1]</SMALL></SUP> It is a short code of ethics compiled from selections from various authors, and is one of several that I have translated from the Burmese language, which are themselves translations from the Pali. The present work is taught in the Burmese monasteries to the daily scholars and resident novices. The necessity of learning and the advantages of education are impressed upon the youthful population from an early age, and the consequences of ignorance are contrasted at the same time. It may perhaps be interesting to notice briefly the system of education adopted in Burmah; this is so simple in its practical application that I can explain it in a few words. The clergy receive no pay, and are not connected with the State, but entirely supported by voluntary contributions of food and other necessaries, a small quantity from each meal being set apart for the priests; but this custom is so general, and the portion so freely contributed, that there is generally a surplus of food at the monasteries, sufficient to feed the poor. In return, the poongyees, or priests, educate the whole of the male population without charge or fee of any description, their vocation precluding them from touching money.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education imparted generally consists of reading, writing, arithmetic, and sacred history. A useful amount of education is therefore generally diffused. A higher standard is less common, but a knowledge of algebra, astronomy, and of the classical Pali, besides the rudiments of the arts and sciences, are also imparted to the extent that they are understood by their religious professors. The fact that almost every man can read and write speaks for itself as regards the working of their system, which is based upon universal or national charity; it is firmly fixed and established among the people, and, as I have before stated, it results in feeding the poor, educating the people, and supporting the clergy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same simple system I have no doubt exists also in Japan,</P>

where, as in Burmah, the Buddhist religion exists in greater purity than in other countries, and may perhaps explain the recent interesting accounts that we have lately received, and be the cause of the prosperous, satisfactory, and contented condition of this singular and extraordinary nation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code of ethics which I propose to read to you is in every day use, and is generally known, being one of their elementary books.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Burmese resemble the Persians in their style of conversation being remarkably figurative in their manner of expressing themselves, constantly seasoning their conversation wlth proverbs, metaphors, poetry, and citations from this work, either for attack or defence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But little of the literature of the Burmese has been translated, and it is therefore almost unknown. It is in a great measure derived from the Pali, but they are far from being deficient in strictly national literature, possessing a written history and poetry of their own, besides works too numerous to mention upon astronomy, botany, law, medicine, statistics, revelations, and also of fiction. Burmah is, comparatively speaking, a new field from which many wild flowers of literature may yet be gathered, sufficient to make a presentable bouquet to the Royal Asiatic Society, and to which I wish to direct the attention of the scholar and student.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bow with reverence to the three principles of worship--namely, God, his precepts (commandments), and disciples; and, having done so, will expound the Loga Nee Dee, a book formed from extracts gathered from various Burmese works on religious law. With respect to this book it deserves among men to be called their Life, Father, Mother, Teacher, Friend: therefore is it that those who have made themselves acquainted with its contents are celebrated for their wisdom and intelligence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_110"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>110</FONT>. Those friends who flatter you to your face, but slander you behind your back, resemble a pot of poisoned honey, which must be thrown away; for though it is sweet yet it is dangerous.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_111"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>111</FONT>. Many cling to you while rich, but desert you when poor; even relations, friends, and wives; therefore consider your wealth your best friend.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_112"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>112</FONT>. A good servant is known by the cheerfulness with which he performs his work; a friend and wife in the time of adversity.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_113"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>113</FONT>. Consider your partner in business as a relation, those who support you as a father, those who console you in trouble as a wife.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_114"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>114</FONT>. Associate not with your enemies, be not too familiar with your friends; for if you quarrel they will reproach you with your defects which you have acquainted them with. Never admit to your confidence a friend with whom you have seriously quarrelled, for it is as dangerous as opening the side of a mare to bring forth its foal.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_115"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>115</FONT>. Quarrel not with an enemy if away from your friends and assistance, but carry him on your back should he desire it; but if you come to a place where you have assistance, cast him off, and break him like an earthen jar if you can.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_116"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>116</FONT>. In putting out a fire leave not the slightest ember behind, in discharging debts leave not a portion unpaid, and in war leave not a single enemy; for these three things will increase and destroy you.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_117"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>117</FONT>. Associate not with those who flatter and fawn upon you with fair looks and words, for they resemble a snake, which, though handsome in shape, has venom in its fangs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_121"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>121</FONT>. A good friend is one who when you are sick attends upon you and gives you medicine, who feeds you when you are hungry, assists you when in poverty, delivers you from your enemies, who will plead for you when in trouble with your rulers, and at the last get execution of judgment put aside; such a friend is to be prized and cherished.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_122"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>122</FONT>. The cuckoo's notes are pleasant, a beautiful woman's glory is in the acquisition of a good husband, a plain person in his learning, priests and hermits in their patience and forbearance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_123"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>123</FONT>. A woman's wealth is in her beauty, a man's wealth in his knowledge, a priest's wealth in religion, the wealth of kings and rulers in their revenue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_124"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>124</FONT>. Priests and hermits are handsome when lean, four-footed animals when fat, men when learned, and women when married.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_125"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>125</FONT>. Buffaloes delight in mud, the bird henza in beautiful lakes of clear water, women in the society of men, and priests in the words of truth and wisdom.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_127"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>127</FONT>. Trust not a woman who has separated three times from three different husbands, a priest who has changed to three different temples, or a bird that has escaped three times from the snare of the fowler; they are very cunning and deceitful.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_128"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>128</FONT>. The wicked are tamed by punishment, false friends are mastered by shunning them, a wicked or unruly wife by taking all your property out of her keeping, a gourmand is mastered by starvation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_129"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>129</FONT>. The night without moonlight is not beautiful, the sea without billows is not beautiful, a woman without a husband is not beautiful to contemplate, for from a husband she derives her ease and comfort; she is but able to take care of the property he accumulates, which she retains as a box, the husband being the source of all her happiness; and it well may be said that the woman is like the thread in the needle, which follows where the latter penetrates and leads.</P>

When a woman is fond of contradicting, of backbiting, and slandering, who is quarrelsome, envious, and wishes for all she sees, who is greedy and eats ber meals before her husband, who is always gadding about to other people's houses, with such a woman remain not; separate from her.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_134"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>134</FONT>. A good wife is as a brother to her husband when he eats or dresses, resembles a sister in modesty when in private with him, a slave when he is preparing for a journey, a friend when in difficulties; she comforts him quickly to sleep, she attires herself neatly to please him, she forbears kindly when he is angry; such a woman has been described by the learned as an excellent woman, and when she dies will attain to a heavenly state.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_135"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>135</FONT>. If a young maiden has a golden complexion, a face with the expression of a deer, a long waist, wide hips, small stomach, thighs and legs tapering like an elephant's trunk, hair that reaches to her heels and turns up regular, and even teeth, and deep navel; should you meet such an one, consider not whether she be poor or rich, but marry her.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_136"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>136</FONT>. November is the best month; a handsome woman the best thing; the eldest son the most prized; and the north side the most liked.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_137"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>137</FONT>. Should a woman desire to be born a man in the course of transmigration, she can only attain this by treating her husband as the angels' wives treat their husbands, with love, respect, and attention.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_138"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>138</FONT>. Should a man desire to return to earth as a man when death and transmigration occur, he should avoid committing adultery as he would shun treading in a miry way.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_139"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>139</FONT>. Old age and extreme youth should not unite in marriage, for it leads to misery and unhappiness.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_140"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>140</FONT>. Kings and ministers should sleep but a quarter of the night, philosophers and learned men but half the night, merchants and traders three parts of the night; but beggars may sleep the whole night.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_141"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>141</FONT>. In a country that has no capital, government, learned man, doctor, or river, remain not a day.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_142"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>142</FONT>. In a place where you are not appreciated, where no one loves you, where you have no friends, where you cannot learn, remain not a day, but be off.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_143"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>143</FONT>. In a house without children there is quietness; in a well-governed country there is quietness;--dark-complexioned and poor people are quiet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_145"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>145</FONT>. When priests and kings become dissatisfied, there is no chance for them, they are lost; a woman of good family, without modesty, is lost; a foolish woman who assumes modesty is lost.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_146"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>146</FONT>. A bird's strength is the air; a fish's strength the water; the strength of the weak is in the law, and the strength of children in their parents.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_147"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>147</FONT>. Rulers should pride themselves in forbearance, intelligence, energy, discrimination, tenderness, forethought, for these bring satisfaction and contentment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_148"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>148</FONT>. Rulers and priests should have but one true word, from which they should never depart.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_149"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>149</FONT>. A man who is married and has a family, but stays at home without working, or exerting himself for their benefit, is lazy and good for nothing; a priest who has not command over his tongue is bad: the governor or magistrate who acts without consideration is worthless; a person who considers himself clever should never lose his temper.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_150"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>150</FONT>. When there is a difference of opinion and discord among the learned, confusion is sure to follow, and bad results therefrom.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_151"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>151</FONT>. Kings should personally know the amount of their revenue and of their expenditure, the quantity of food necessary for the subsistence of their subjects, and inform themselves as to the manner in which the duties of the civil and military services are executed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_152"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>152</FONT>. Repress and keep down those who misbehave, and exalt and reward the deserving.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_153"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>153</FONT>. Fire, water, women, fools, snakes, and rulers should be avoided, for they lead to sudden death.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_154"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>154</FONT>. He who lives in the same house with a wicked woman, a wicked slave, or a venomous snake, is in danger of death.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_155"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>155</FONT>. A clever master loses his reputation in striving to teach a fool who will not learn; a man loses his honour who lives with an unchaste wife; and those who associate with the wicked lose their characters.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_156"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>156</FONT>. Lay not the sin upon the child but upon the mother; when a pupil takes to evil blame the teacher; when the people of a country act improperly blame the rulers; when kings do wrong blame the ministers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_157"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>157</FONT>. Anger is conquered by gentleness; the unjust are conquered by justice; the irritable are mastered by coaxing and presents; liars are conquered by truth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_158"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>158</FONT>. A generous man, though vulgar, becomes refined; a generous man can carry out his wishes with ease; the words of a generous nature are sweet; a man of an amiable disposition is always easy to approach, and you can become acquainted with him; he also can form the acquaintance of whom he wishes. What is generosity? the medicine of love. What is stinginess or avarice? the medicine of hatred. Generosity is a popular medicine; stinginess is a private medicine.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_159"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>159</FONT>. Union is strength; many small fibres united will hold an elephant.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_160"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>160</FONT>. A general or king who does not conquer with an army well provided with arms and stores, of what use is he? he is as a light which will expire by the smallest breath of wind.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_161"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>161</FONT>. Seek not to imitate the pleasures of your rulers, nor their ways, dress, or conversation; perfume not yourself as they do, for they are neither your friends, relations, or equals, but your superiors.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_162"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>162</FONT>. When you approach your superiors, keep not at too great a distance, or approach too near; place not yourself between the wind and them, neither place yourself directly in front of them, or in too high or too low a position; study to avoid these six faults, as you would a burning fire.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_163"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>163</FONT>. A person with the highest qualifications comes to no advantage, if not supported by his king; a precious jewel is only seen to advantage when set in gold.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_164"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>164</FONT>. Believe not a priest religious who converses with women; nor in the humanity of a man who indulges much in the eating of flesh; nor in the promises of a drunkard, or the modesty of a sensualist, or the knowledge of a lazy person, or the wealth of a bad-tempered man.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_165"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>165</FONT>. For the drunkard, night-walker, gambler, lover of plays, and those who associate with lazy people, there is no ease or comfort in life; they will be destroyed after death.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_167"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>167</FONT>. Look before you speak in the daytime; at night look to the right and left, before and behind; as a hunter considers the dangers of the forest, consider before you speak.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_168"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>168</FONT>. Four kinds of living men were called dead men by the author. Who were they? First, an extremely poor man; second, a much oppressed man; third, a most ignorant man; and fourth, a favourite minister. These may be considered as dead men.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_171"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>171</FONT>. Say not to wealth go not to the rich man, for he has plenty, but go to the poor man; nor to the clouds rain not in the sea or in the rivers, for there is already plenty there, but rain alone upon the earth: for where Providence directs thither will they go.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_172"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>172</FONT>. The teacher should not expend the whole of his knowledge upon his pupil, he should retain something to himself that his disciple may respect him; even so in all things, expend not the whole of thy store, keep a reserve.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_173"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>173</FONT>. Silk-cotton is the lightest thing, but lighter than this are careless persons; those who obey not their parents and teachers are the emptiest and lightest of all; but those who neglect their religion and God are lighter than air.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_174"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>174</FONT>. Rocks are heavy. What is heavier? the voice of the N&aacute;ths. What is of greater weight? the advice of parents and teachers: but the words of God are of greatest weight.</P>

The cow should be respected and appreciated, as she nourishes man; and should therefore be considered as a mother, as her milk gives him food, and she conduces to his ease and comfort: all men eat her flesh, but those who do so, eat as it were their mother's flesh; it should not be eaten, but when she dies her flesh should be given to the vultures,</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_177"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>177</FONT>. Those who commence their studies on a Thursday learn thoroughly; those who commence on a Sunday or Friday obtain mediocrity; those who commence on a Saturday or Tuesday are liable to die.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_178"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>178</FONT>. To commence studying on the eighth day of the increase or wane of the moon is equal to killing the teacher; on the fourteenth of the increase or waning moon it is equal to killing the pupil; on the tenth increase or wane, it is equal to the destruction of all learning; on the full moon, it is equal to killing your parents.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_179"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>179</FONT>. Those who wish to learn should not on the seventh day of the increase or wane of the moon eat of coco nuts; on the third increase or wane they should not eat venison or the flesh of any other animal, for if they do they will lose what they have learned, by forgetting it.</P>

A frog once thought itself a lion, because its posture when seated was the same, but a crow seized the frog and made it croak for fear; so is it with those who assume a knowledge of what they do not understand: when they are in the company of those who have knowledge, fearing that they may be questioned, they cry out "Master, master," and show great civility. Can the wild boar think itself a cheetah, because his grunting somewhat resembles it? Does the cat imagine itself a tiger?
