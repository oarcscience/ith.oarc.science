> ART. IV.--*The Tattva-muktavâlî of Gau.da-pûr.nânanda-chakra-vartin*.
> Edited and Translated by Prof. E. B. COWELL.

THE following poem was written by a native of Bengal, named Pûr.nânanda
Chakravartin. Nothing is known as to his date; if the work were
identical with the poem of the same name mentioned in the account of the
Râmânuja system in Mâdhava's Sarvadaršanasa.mgraha, it would be, of
course, older than the fourteenth century, but this is very uncertain; I
should be inclined to assign it to a later date. The chief interest of
the poem consists in its being a vigorous attack on the Vedânta system
by a follower of the Pûr.naprajña school, which was founded by Madhva
(or Ânandatîrtha) in the thirteenth century in the South of India. Some
account of his system (which in many respects agrees with that of
Râmânuja) is given in Wilson's "Hindu Sects;"<span
id="page_137_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_137_note_1.md) but the fullest account
is to be found in the fifth chapter of the Sarvadaršanasa.mgraha. Both
the Râmânujas and the Pûr.naprajñas hold in opposition to the
Vedânta<span id="page_137_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_137_note_2.md) that individual souls
are distinct from Brahman; but they differ as to the sense in which they
are thus distinct. The former <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> maintain
that "unity" and "plurality" are equally true from different points of
view; the latter hold that the relation between the individual soul and
Brahman is that of a master and a servant, and consequently that they
are absolutely separate. It need not surprise us, therefore, to see
that, although Râmânuja is praised in the fifty-third sloka of this poem
as "the foremost of the learned," some of his tenets are attacked in the
eightieth.

   The Sanskrit text of this poem was published in the Benares Pa.n.dit
for Sept. 1871, by Pa.n.dit Vechârâma Šarman. An edition, with a Bengali
translation, was also published some years ago in Calcutta, by
Jagadânanda Goswâmin;<span id="page_138_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_138_note_1.md) but the text is so full
of false readings of every kind, and the translation in consequence goes
so often astray, that I have not found much help from it. I have
collated the text in the Benares Pa.n.dit (A.) with a MS. (B.) sent to
me by my friend, Pa.n.dit Mahešachandra Nyâyaratna, the Principal of the
Calcutta Sanskrit College. He has also sent me the readings in certain
passages from two MSS. in the Calcutta Sanskrit College Library (C.D.);
and I have to thank him for his help in explaining some obscure
allusions.

   The poem itself seems to me an interesting contribution to the
history of Hindu philosophical controversy,<span
id="page_138_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_138_note_2.md) and so I have subjoined
a literal English translation. I would venture to remind my readers of
the words of the manager in the prologue of the Mâlavikâgnimitra, "Every
old poem is not good because it is old, nor is every modern poem to be
blamed simply because it is modern."

TRANSLATION.

   <span id="pp_1"></span>1. Victorious is the garland-wearing
foster-son of Nanda,--the protector of his devotees,--the destroyer of
the cruel king,--dark-blue like the delicate tamâla
blossoms,--formidable with his many outspread rays,--mighty with all his
attendant powers,<span id="page_155_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_155_note_1.md)--and having his forehead
radiant like the moon.

   <span id="pp_2"></span>2. This follower of the Purâ.nas, who holds by
his own belief, reads to his heart's content the Purâ.na in the morning,
and he listens devotedly with profound meditation, his whole mind intent
on the meaning of the book.

   <span id="pp_3"></span>3. Having abandoned the doctrine of the
oneness of the individual and the Supreme Soul, he establishes by
argument their mutual difference; having used Šruti and Šm.riti as a
manifold proof, he employs Inference in many ways in the controversy.

   <span id="pp_4"></span>4. This individual soul must be different from
Brahman because it is always circumscribed,--many are the similar
arguments which are to be acknowledged in the course of our reasonings.

   <span id="pp_5"></span>5. "Might we not say that a jar and a web
could be called identical because both are cognizable?"<span
id="page_155_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_155_note_2.md) But we cannot say so in
regard to these two things in question, for Brahman alone is that which
cannot be cognized.

   <span id="pp_6"></span>6. The sentence "Thou art That" (*tat tvam
asi*) which is understood in its primary meaning as referring to the
object of the Veda,<span id="page_155_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_155_note_3.md)--the author thus
explains its meaning, as he knows his own doctrine, and has fixed his
mind on the system of Duality; since the word 'that' (*tat*) is here
indeclinable and implies a difference, and the word 'thou' (*tvam*)
means that which is to be differentiated, the sign of the genitive case
has been elided;<span id="page_155_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_155_note_4.md) "thou only," such is not
the meaning of the sentence.<span id="page_155_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_155_note_5.md)

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

   <span id="pp_7"></span>7. He is all-knowing, all-seeing, Himself the
three worlds, in whose belly thou art thyself contained,--He causes at
once by a movement of the brow the creation, preservation, and
absorption of all beings! Thou art ignorant, and only seest relatively,
He is the adorable, the one Witness of all worlds; thou art changing, He
is One; thou art all dull and stained, not such is He.

   <span id="pp_8"></span>8. As for the text "I am Brahman," you must
take the nominative case as only used there for the genitive by the
licence of an inspired speaker. How, if it were otherwise, would there
be a genitive in the illustration,<span
id="page_156_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_156_note_1.md) as in the sentence "as
the sparks of the fire"?

   <span id="pp_9"></span>9. The poets call a lad fire (from his hot
temper), the face the orb of a full moon, the eye a blue lotus, the
bosom mount Meru, and the hand a young shoot; by a confusion of the
superimposed appearance we may thus have the idea of identity where
there is still a real difference; and so too must we deal with those
words of Šruti "I am Brahman."<span
id="page_156_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_156_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_10"></span>10. As there are many waves in the sea, so
are we many individual souls in Brahman; the wave can never become the
sea; how then wilt thou, the individual soul, become Brahman?

   <span id="pp_11"></span>11. In the depths of all Šâstras the two
things are both recognized, knowledge and ignorance; so too virtue and
vice; and thus also science, and next to it closely clinging behind, but
other than it, appears false science; thus everywhere there are opposite
pairs, and similar is the notorious pair, Brahman and the soul. How can
these two have oneness? Let the good answer with an upright mind.

   <span id="pp_12"></span>12. Thou, O Soul, art the reflection of the
Supreme Being, who possesses the power of illusion and is the substratum
of <span id="page_157">p. 157</span> all, while He, the adorable, shines
forth as Himself the original; the one moon in the sky is seen manifold
in water and the like; therefore there is a difference between thee and
Brahman as between the reflection and its original.

   <span id="pp_13"></span>13. Yonder Brahman is described by the words
of the sacred texts as not to be known, nor to be reasoned about, and as
devoid of all desire; but thou art within the range of speech and of
thought; how shall there be oneness of thee and Brahman?

   <span id="pp_14"></span>14. Thou art verily bereft of thy
understanding, O individual Soul, by the darkness of this doctrine of
Mâyâ, while thou constantly proclaimest like a madman "I am Brahman";
where is thy sovereignty, where thy empire, where thy omniscience? There
is as vast a difference between Brahman and thee as between mount Meru
and a mustard-seed!

   <span id="pp_15"></span>15. Thou art a finite soul, He is indeed
all-pervading; thou standest only on one spot, while He is everywhere
always; thou, being of a moment, art happy and unhappy; He is happy at
all times; how canst thou say "I am He"? Fie! art thou not ashamed?

   <span id="pp_16"></span>16. Glass is glass, and a gem is a gem; a
shell is but a shell, and silver is silver; there is never seen a
transposition<span id="page_157_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_157_note_1.md) among them. But wherever
other things are imagined, to be found in something else, it is through
an error; and so it is when the soul utters such words as "that art
thou!"

   <span id="pp_17"></span>17. The meaning of the word "*that*" (*tat*)
is an ocean of immortality, filled with manifest and supreme felicity;
the meaning of the word "*thou*" is a most miserable being, bewildered
in mind through the burden of the fear of existence; these two can never
be one, they are divided by the nature of things; the doctrine of
Non-unity is the truth for all worlds, thou art but His slave.

   <span id="pp_18"></span>18. If Brahman were meant by these words, the
power employed would not be Denotation, for their literal meaning <span
id="page_158">p. 158</span> does not apply;<span
id="page_158_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_158_note_1.md) consequently it must be
the second power of a word, Indication.

   <span id="pp_19"></span>19. Yet if so, why should it be Indication?
for this arises from some association with the primary meaning; but with
what can that substance be associated which is disconnected with
everything and without a second?

   <span id="pp_20"></span>20. That power of a word is Indication, by
which, when the primary meaning is precluded, some other meaning is
indicated in connexion therewith, through some motive or through common
currency; and its causes are thus three.<span
id="page_158_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_158_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_21"></span>21. Now if there is no Denotation in a
phrase, how can there arise any Indication? First there should be some
primary meaning precluded, and then there may be the Indication of
something else.

   <span id="pp_22"></span>22. Where there is no accepted Denotation,
how can you there have Indication? If there is no village, how can there
be a boundary?--there is no child without a father.<span
id="page_158_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_158_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_23"></span>23. "The lances enter, the swords, the bows
and arrows,"--here we have Indication; for the sentence must suggest
something else to complete itself, as there cannot be "entrance" in the
case of an inanimate subject.

   <span id="pp_24"></span>24. "A herd-station on the Ganges,"--here we
have the self-sacrifice of the primary to another meaning, since the
Ganges, as being in the form of water, cannot be the site of a
herd-station.

   <span id="pp_25"></span>25. In the example "ghî is life" there is
produced the <span id="page_159">p. 159</span> idea of sameness of form;
in the example "this is life" there arises the idea of identity;<span
id="page_159_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_159_note_1.md) but the knowledge of the
meaning of the sentences will be produced by a metaphor,--there is not
brought about a real oneness.

   <span id="pp_26"></span>26. The doctrine of Identity is established
with a desperate effort, and men have recourse to the power
"Indication"; but there are three things which should rise to our
view,--the primary meaning, the indicated meaning, and their
connexion.<span id="page_159_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_159_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_27"></span>27. There is here no Denotation from the
absence of conventional agreement; there is no Indication from the
absence of any reason \[to establish it\]; by what reason, on the theory
of Mâyâ, can Brahman be ever made known?

   <span id="pp_28"></span>28. He is described<span
id="page_159_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_159_note_3.md) in the Veda by the
primary power of words \[Denotation\] as the Maker of the Universe; and
by Inference we establish the conclusion that all these things have a
Maker.

   <span id="pp_29"></span>29. The Vedas are a proof, the Šm.ritis are a
proof; there is a being to be proved and known there in many passages;
it is the great Personality which is to be made known by all the
Vedas,--therefore it is this which the Veda takes as its subject.

   <span id="pp_30"></span>30. True verbal testimony produces knowledge
even in regard to that which is absolutely non-existent,--then how much
more in regard to Brahman the Lord, the maker of all that moves or is
motionless!

   <span id="pp_31"></span>31. It is said,<span
id="page_159_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_159_note_4.md) "Speech retires
therefrom together with the Mind,"--but this is its explanation,--give
ear: Together with the Mind Speech makes Him its object, and then
retires, because His nature is not to be fathomed.

   <span id="pp_32"></span>32. "Brahman is not to be made the object of
mind or of <span id="page_160">p. 160</span> words,"<span
id="page_160_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_160_note_1.md)--from this saying it is
understood that he is only to be declared by Revelation, Revelation has
no faltering action.<span id="page_160_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_160_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_33"></span>33. "He who is versed in the Word-Brahman
attains to the highest Brahman,"<span
id="page_160_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_160_note_3.md)--surely such words of
inspired sages are not mistaken babble.

   <span id="pp_34"></span>34. Assuredly the conventional meaning of the
words "existent," "thought," and "joy" applies to Brahman, just as the
words "pot," "cloth," etc., refer to those particular objects.

   <span id="pp_35"></span>35. The perception of the conventional
meaning of words is aroused by the dialogue of the orderer and the
ordered; and afterwards by insertion and omission the child becomes
thoroughly skilled in the use of the words.<span
id="page_160_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_160_note_4.md)

   <span id="pp_36"></span>36. So through hearing the words of the
teacher and repeated study of the šâstras the conventional meaning of
such words as Brahman, etc., is assuredly produced in the pupil.

   <span id="pp_37"></span>37. This earth must surely have had a maker;
for its having the nature of an effect is a sign, just as we see to be
the case in pots, etc.

   <span id="pp_38"></span>38. If it is established that the supreme
Lord is the maker, then his having a body follows as a matter of
course;<span id="page_160_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_160_note_5.md) for in all effects, as
pots and the like, the maker is seen to have a body and not to be
bodiless.

   <span id="pp_39"></span>39. \[The objector urges\] "If the supreme
Lord has a body, then he will be like to beings such as we are; there
cannot be a maker without an intermediate agency,<span
id="page_160_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_160_note_6.md)--I see no difference
whatever."

   <span id="pp_40"></span>40. But great is the difference which is
declared to exist between the Adorable Lord and men working with spades,
<span id="page_161">p. 161</span> sickles, ploughshares, and hands;
these are helpless in the six waves<span
id="page_161_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_161_note_1.md) \[of human infirmity,\]
and wearied with the burden of labour,--He effects everything by a mere
motion of his brow.

   <span id="pp_41"></span>41. The Master can make, not make,<span
id="page_161_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_161_note_2.md) and alter; hence one may
learn that vast is the interval between the two.

   <span id="pp_42"></span>42. If the body is called the site of
enjoyment, it is well known that this definition will hold good \[even
in this highest case<span id="page_161_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_161_note_3.md)\],--there is nothing
deficient but everything is present in the Lord's body,<span
id="page_161_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_161_note_4.md) since He is the husband
of Lakshmî.

   <span id="pp_43"></span>43. "Every body is influenced by
deserts,"--if this universal law is accepted, then He who is the Maker
of all must be impelled \[to create the world\] by the deserts which
dominate over beings like us.<span id="page_161_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_161_note_5.md)

   <span id="pp_44"></span>44. "Every body must be non-eternal,"--this
is a general law, yet still Îšvara's body may be eternal; for earth is
everywhere seen to be non-eternal, while in the form of its atoms it is
eternal.

   <span id="pp_45"></span>45. One must not say, "why should the desert
of one attach itself to another?" For it was in consequence of the
respective merits and demerits of the elephant and the crocodile that
the holder of the discus made all haste to interfere in the battle.<span
id="page_161_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_161_note_6.md)

   <span id="pp_46"></span>46. It has been heard of old that all this
universe proceeded from the lotus of the navel of the Lord; hence is it
established that be has a body, for how can there be a navel without a
body?

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

   <span id="pp_47"></span>47. The body of God is very pure,--to be
enjoyed by all the senses, as being richly endowed with the six
qualities,<span id="page_162_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_162_note_1.md)--and to be discovered by
means of all the Vedas,--Gangâ verily is the water wherewith he washes
his feet.

   <span id="pp_48"></span>48. Whenever by the influence of time there
comes the increase of evil and the diminution of right, then the
adorable Lord accomplishes the preservation of the good and the
destruction of the wicked.

   <span id="pp_49"></span>49. The Lord is said to be twofold, as the
Incarnation and He who becomes incarnate; so too the souls are twofold,
as divided into faithful and faithless.

   <span id="pp_50"></span>50. Now some say that the personal soul is
only the reflection of the Supreme; but their opinion does not at all
hold, since it cannot be established.

   <span id="pp_51"></span>51. For how could there arise a reflection of
that Infinite and stainless one? and how could an insentient
\[reflection\] enjoy the pain and pleasure arising from the merit and
demerit declared in the Veda?

   <span id="pp_52"></span>52. There may indeed be a reflection of that
which is limited; but how shall there be one of Him whose attribute is
infinity?

   <span id="pp_53"></span>53. Râmânuja, the foremost of the learned,
condemned this theory of an original and its reflection; the fact that
this doctrine is not accepted by the learned, will not make it seem more
plausible.

   <span id="pp_54"></span>54. There is an eternal division between the
two, from the words of the Veda, "two birds;"<span
id="page_162_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_162_note_2.md) from the mention there
of "two friends," how can there be identity between them?

   <span id="pp_55"></span>55. I become Brahman, that is, I cease to
have mundane existence through beholding the soul in Brahman; the result
of this would be the abolition of sorrow, etc., but in no way absolute
Oneness.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

   <span id="pp_56"></span>56. I become Brahman also through beholding
Brahman in the soul;<span id="page_163_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_163_note_1.md) the result would be the
abolition of His being out of sight,<span
id="page_163_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_163_note_2.md) but in no way Oneness.

   <span id="pp_57"></span>57. It must not be said that by continued
meditation with intent thought a man becomes Brahman; there will only
enter into him a little merit; as we see indeed in the case of worms,
bees, and the like;<span id="page_163_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_163_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_58"></span>58. By devotedly worshipping Brâhmans without
ceasing, a Šûdra will never become a Brâhman; there may enter into him a
little merit, but one of the Šûdra caste will never become a Brâhman.

   <span id="pp_59"></span>59. The venerable author of the Aphorisms
himself established a duality when he spoke of the application of the
terms "object" and "agent";<span id="page_163_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_163_note_4.md) and thus has it been
explained by the author of the commentary by quoting passages of the
Veda which imply duality, as that which says "the two entered the cave."

   <span id="pp_60"></span>60. The soul is also shown to be different
\[from Brahman\] by the evidence of Šm.riti;<span
id="page_163_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_163_note_5.md) thus their difference is
proved to be essential. If it were not so, how could the Commentator
have used such an expression as "the worshipper" and "the
worshipped"?<span id="page_163_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_163_note_6.md)

   <span id="pp_61"></span>61. I am sometimes happy, sometimes
miserable; He, the supreme Soul, is always essentially happy. Such is
the difference,--then how can there be identity between these two
different substances?

   <span id="pp_62"></span>62. He is eternally self-luminous and
unobscured,-- <span id="page_164">p. 164</span> intensely pure, the one
witness of the world; not so is the individual soul,--thus a thunderbolt
falls on the tree of the theory of Identity.

   <span id="pp_63"></span>63. For those who maintain the identity of
the individual and supreme soul, the hypothesis of a *dvandva*
compound<span id="page_164_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_164_note_1.md) is precluded; or they
bring forward such words as *d.rishadupala* as parallel cases;<span
id="page_164_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_164_note_2.md) the *dvandva* is only
consistent with "difference," but in no way with "identity."

   <span id="pp_64"></span>64. Where identity is the meaning, there
arises the *karmadhâraya* compound,--for \[such a *karmadhâraya* as\]
*nîlotpala* "the blue-lotus" is used as implying that the two members of
the compound refer to the same subject.<span
id="page_164_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_164_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_65"></span>65. As there are many passages in Šruti such
as that which says "food is Brahman,"<span
id="page_164_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_164_note_4.md) so too this passage "I
am Brahman" is to be understood as meaning worship.<span
id="page_164_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_164_note_5.md)

   <span id="pp_66"></span>66. The doctrine of Identity is not true;
wherever it appears to be declared in Šruti, all those passages are to
be taken as only meaning worship.

   <span id="pp_67"></span>67. There are many sentences in the ancient
Veda which speak for non-identity as also for identity; having expelled
envy and discussed the truth, let the wise declare that which each
thinks wholesome.

   <span id="pp_68"></span>68. O soul, bewildered by a deceived opinion,
drive far from thy mouth these words "I am Brahman"; how canst thou be
That, O thou who art utterly at the mercy of fate, plunged as thou art
in the great ocean of mundane existence hard to be crossed!

   <span id="pp_69"></span>69. He who is the beloved of Lakshmi, the
ambrosia-ocean, full of manifest supreme joy; the water of whose feet is
Gangâ, worthy to be worshipped by Rudra and the other gods; who before
creation created all instantaneously by a <span id="page_165">p.
165</span> movement of his brow,--how canst thou say, O soul, "I am
He,"--thou who art a poor beggar, not a king.

   <span id="pp_70"></span>70. O slow of mind, how canst thou say, I am
He with whom are filled all the vast stores of this universe in its
entirety? Collect thy faculties calmly in thy heart and consider thine
own power; can a host of fierce world-supporting elephants enter into
the belly of a gnat?

   <span id="pp_71"></span>71. Whose art thou? whence art thou come? how
is the course of this mundane bondage? Ponder this matter in thy heart
and forsake the path of the erring. Say not "I am He"; but worship Hari
continually in the relation of adorer and adored; by this thou mayst
attain the happy journey, but otherwise thou wilt assuredly fall.

   <span id="pp_72"></span>72. Great is the misery which thou hast
experienced, O Soul, while dwelling in the womb in various births, and
thou hast wandered again and again in heaven or in hell; this theory "I
am He" is an error of thine,--worship thou Hari's lotus feet; thou art
His worshipper, He is the adorable, for He is the lord of the three
worlds.

   <span id="pp_73"></span>73. Renouncing the so-called theory of
identity, forthwith devote thyself to duality, if there now dwells in
thy heart a supreme feeling of faith in Hari; and, having learned the
doctrine in Nârada's Pañcharâtra and everywhere else, let all the hymns
of the Vaish.nava sacred books be thoroughly examined, as is truly for
thy good.

   <span id="pp_74"></span>74. By what foolish teacher hast thou been
instructed, that thou utterest these words "I am Brahman"? How art thou
that being who is continually worshipped by Rudra and all the gods? O
fool, consider it and see aright.

   <span id="pp_75"></span>75. The wicked cannot understand the
difference between the embodied and the Supreme Souls; the great reason
for this is a mind possessed by an evil obstinacy in favour of the
doctrine of Illusion; just as the tongue of those who suffer from excess
of bile cannot taste the sweetness of molasses, nor the eyes of those
afflicted with gutta serena or jaundice see the whiteness of a shell.

   <span id="pp_76"></span>76. He by a particle of whose intellect thou,
O Soul, hast been produced the foremost of intelligent beings--say not,
<span id="page_166">p. 166</span> O knave, that thou art *He*; for who
but the ingrate desires to seize the seat of his Master?

   <span id="pp_77"></span>77. A particle of intelligence has been
deposited in thee by the supreme Lord in His mercy,--it becomes thee
not, O knave, to say that therefore thou art God; just as if some
evil-minded man had received elephants, horses, and infantry from the
king and then set his heart on seizing his kingdom.

   <span id="pp_78"></span>78. He under whose control is that mighty
illusion which deceives the three worlds, He is to be recognized as the
Supreme Lord, the adorable, essentially thought, existence and joy; but
he who is himself always under her control like a camel drawn by a
string through his nostrils, is to be recognized as the individual
soul,--vast indeed is the difference between the two!

   <span id="pp_79"></span>79. Having studied the doctrines of the
Sâ"nkhya, Ka.nâda, and Gautama, and the doctrine of Patañjali, the
doctrines of the Mîmâ.msâ and Bha.t.tabhâskara,<span
id="page_166_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_166_note_1.md)--amidst all the six
current systems,--let the wise tell the final conclusion if they can as
to the real nature of the supreme and the individual soul,--is it
duality, or is it oneness, or is it again a oneness in duality?

   <span id="pp_80"></span>80. In five of the systems I have only heard
peremptorily asserted in many places the difference between the supreme
and the individual souls; what is this that I hear asserted in the
Vedânta system? "Plurality, unity, both,"--this is a threefold
marvel!<span id="page_166_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_166_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_81"></span>81. He who is the maker of all and the Lord
of the world is independent by reason of his essential independence; the
individual soul is notoriously dependent; how can they say then that
these two are identical?

   <span id="pp_82"></span>82. There are various flavours in honey
\[existing distinct\] through the difference of the trees \[from whose
flowers <span id="page_167">p. 167</span> it is produced\]; how else
could it remove the three-fold disorders?<span
id="page_167_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_167_note_1.md) So the individual souls
at the world's dissolution are absorbed in the Lord; but they do not
become identified with Him, for they are again separated at the next
creation.

   <span id="pp_83"></span>83. There is a difference between rivers and
the sea, with their respective sweet and salt water; so too God and the
soul are different and possessed of distinct attributes.<span
id="page_167_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_167_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_84"></span>84. Rivers, when joined to the sea from all
sides, are not identified with it nor yet do they appear to be separate;
but from the difference between salt water and sweet water<span
id="page_167_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_167_note_3.md) there must be a real
difference between them.

   <span id="pp_85"></span>85. Others see not the difference when water
is mixed with milk, but the swan at once separates the milk and the
water;<span id="page_167_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_167_note_4.md) so too when the souls
are absorbed in the supreme Brahman, the Lord,--the faithful, who have
received the Guru's words, can at once draw a difference between them.

   <span id="pp_86"></span>86. Even when milk is mixed with milk and
water with water, they do not become absolutely identified, for they
still retain their fixed measure as before; so, when the souls through
intense contemplation are absorbed in the Supreme Spirit, they do not
become identified with Him; thus say the pure-minded saints.

   <span id="pp_87"></span>87. There are certain disputants, sunk in a
sea of false logic, addicted to an evil way, filled with a hundred
imaginations of idle babble, deceived themselves and deceiving <span
id="page_168">p. 168</span> the world,--all that they say, "I am Brahman
and all this visible universe also is Brahman,"--is now shown clearly to
be an empty desire.

   <span id="pp_88"></span>88. If I and all this universe were Brahman,
then there would be an identity between thee and me; then thy wealth,
sons, and wife would be mine, and mine would be thine, for there would
be no distinction between us.

   <span id="pp_89"></span>89. And how then could there be injunction or
prohibition, since all are one, and there is no distinction of caste? If
the doctrine of non-duality be thus held to be established, then what
offence has the Buddhist committed?

   <span id="pp_90"></span>90. "The Soul is different from the elements,
the senses, the internal organ, and primary matter, and also from that
which is called the individual,"--thus has it been declared of old by
Kapila to his mother in the third book of the Bhâgavata<span
id="page_168_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_168_note_1) (Purâ.na.md).

   <span id="pp_91"></span>91. Those who study the path pointed out by
the teacher, resting upon a foundation of naught, and maintain with an
empty understanding that all is void and that all the recognized deities
are naught,--how can many words be uttered about them, for language
fails in a topic of naught; naught indeed is their wisdom, and their
fruit shall be also mostly naught.

   <span id="pp_92"></span>92. There are words uttered by Vyâsa in the
Bhârata condemning this doctrine of the nothingness of all things;<span
id="page_168_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_168_note_2.md) "their bodies are
composed of the quality of darkness, and verily darkness shall be their
end;"<span id="page_168_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_168_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_93"></span>93. These words which were uttered of old by
Kapila in the presence of the sage Syûmarašmi,<span
id="page_168_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_168_note_4.md) were afterwards
recounted by Vyâsa in the Bhâ.rata.

   <span id="pp_94"></span>94. This theory of theirs concerning a void
of qualities in Him who is the ocean of qualities,<span
id="page_168_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_168_note_5.md)--it is but like the
blind <span id="page_169">p. 169</span> hurrying of sheep after the ewe
that leads them! Having made a separate commentary of their own on the
Sûtras they deceive those who follow their doctrine.

   <span id="pp_95"></span>95. All these qualities, sovereignty,
creation, and the like, eternally belong to the Supreme Lord; how then
can He be "without qualities" who is thus "possessed of qualities"? he
theory of a void of qualities is mere disputation.

   <span id="pp_96"></span>96. The adorable one possesses knowledge,
volition, and creative power; how then can he be destitute of qualities?
or, if he is destitute of qualities, how can he be set forth by the
Vedas? How can the absence of qualities be predicated of the sea of
qualities, and yet all remonstrance be silent? Ponder it well in thine
own mind, and then determine what is right.

   <span id="pp_97"></span>97. A substance without attributes, like the
sky-flower, is not admitted either in the Veda or in the world; if the
knowledge of such a thing were derived from the Veda, the Veda itself
would then cease to be an authority.

   <span id="pp_98"></span>98. \[The Vedântin may reply\] "The bunch of
Darbha grass<span id="page_169_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_169_note_1.md) is said to be the
sacrificer, as it is the means of performing the sacrifice; \[as the
Darbha grass is understood by this description,\] even though the
attributes thus ascribed are not found in it, so is Brahman understood
when we ascribe certain qualities \[as 'truth,' etc., even though these
qualities are precluded in a being without qualities\]."

   <span id="pp_99"></span>99. \[I answer\] A thorough Vedântin like
thee does not accept any where the existence of qualities or that which
possesses qualities; but if imagined qualities are done away with \[by
deeper insight\], real qualities are nowhere done away with.<span
id="page_169_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_169_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_100"></span>100. If Brahman is understood to be
destitute of qualities, <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> then "truth,"
etc., will not be applicable to Him; but, if so, there arises a
contradiction in such passages \[of Šruti\] as "he is the truthful,"
etc.<span id="page_170_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_170_note_1.md)

   <span id="pp_101"></span>101. When the existence of such a thing as a
quality is admitted, we can imagine it in something else;<span
id="page_170_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_170_note_2.md) but to imagine that
nacre is silver, we must first know clearly what silver is.

   <span id="pp_102"></span>102. This universe is based on the soul as
its site, being imagined in it by ignorance; some teachers would
describe it as an illusory emanation;<span
id="page_170_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_170_note_3.md) but this is not a
pleasing doctrine to me.

   <span id="pp_103"></span>103. It cannot be said that all this
universe is false; since it is really the plaything of Hari, who is
eternally engaged in sport.<span id="page_170_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_170_note_4.md)

   <span id="pp_104"></span>104. The external world is not like a dream;
for in dreams there is sleep and a host of imperfections; what we eat or
drink in dreams gives us no enjoyment, but these things are enjoyable in
our waking state.

   <span id="pp_105"></span>105. If all that is seen were false, then
how could it produce effects? The carrying of water in a jar is not
false; all we can say is that it is transient.

   <span id="pp_106"></span>106. The idea that all this world is false,
is opposed to experience; for of what use would be all the expiations
for sin, prescribed in the law-books? Why are these thieves to be
punished even by the king? The upholder of the doctrine of Mâyâ can
assert anything on his oath, but all is false.

   <span id="pp_107"></span>107. Thou canst not say that the visible
world is only like the transitory enjoyment of one who smells a wreath
of flowers; however closely it is scanned, there is no overpowering
evidence of its unreality \[to preclude the presumption <span
id="page_171">p. 171</span> founded on experience\]; it continually
manifests itself to us as eternal in its stream of successive events.

   <span id="pp_108"></span>108. This world is not false but it is
rendered true by Vish.nu's protection;<span
id="page_171_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_171_note_1.md) thou art made pure by
the knowledge of Him, as all minerals shine as gold \[when brought in
contact with the philosopher's stone\].

   <span id="pp_109"></span>109. Dispassion and enjoyment stand equally
aloof as disinterested spectators and are lost in faith; the partaking
of the consecrated food is in no sense to be called an "enjoyment,"--it
is itself an act of faith.<span id="page_171_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_171_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_110"></span>110. By intense devotion to his object the
man of the world will become the devotee of enjoyment, and by the
absence of all enjoyment a man becomes absolutely dispassionate; this is
the real truth.<span id="page_171_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_171_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_111"></span>111. By association with the good and by
repeatedly listening to the story of K.rish.na's sports there has arisen
in the lake of the mind the great wave of pure faith and pure affection;
abandoning the doctrine of unity and without hesitation embracing that
of duality, we worship with our whole heart the lotus-feet of the
beloved of Lakshmî.

   <span id="pp_112"></span>112. There is a rule in the things of the
world, that he who is near the king may be called the king; so too in
the things of Brahman and the soul must we understand the various sacred
texts \[which at first sight appear to identify them\].

   <span id="pp_113"></span>113. He in whom the universe,--sun, moon,
and the rest, <span id="page_172">p. 172</span> with the three
worlds,--rose into being,--in whom it all abides until it perishes,--and
in whom, each in its own time, it is all finally dissolved,--He, the
Lord, whom, being beyond all qualities,<span
id="page_172_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_172_note_1.md) even Brahman himself
cannot declare in the Vedas,--why, O teacher, dost thou teach this
miserable me the words "I am He"?

   <span id="pp_114"></span>114. He in whom the storehouse of the
universe with all its creatures great and small, was all contained like
a line of insects drowned in a ripe fruit of the glomerous fig-tree,--in
whom it abides until the final destruction,--and in whom it is
eventually dissolved,--Ah! how can there come from my mouth, O teacher,
these words "I am He"?

   <span id="pp_115"></span>115. Him, the Supreme Lord, by whose
compassion even the dumb becomes eloquent, the lame in a moment obtains
strength to leap mountains, and even the man blind from his birth
receives eyes beautiful like two lotuses,--or what still greater marvel
shall I add?--Him I worship, the moon-faced son of Nanda, the
philosopher's stone of the faithful.

   <span id="pp_116"></span>116. Boundless is time, bounteous the earth,
and great is the family of the devout worshippers of Vish.nu; somebody
will be found at some time or other on the earth who will appreciate my
merits.<span id="page_172_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_172_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_117"></span>117. Having studied under my preceptor
Nârâya.na, the best of teachers, his book, which bears the title of "The
Ornament of Faith,"--having read it with all its supplements and
appendices, and by his kindness to his faithful disciples having
mastered all its mysteries,--and having become a receptacle of faith
myself, I have now composed according to my ability this century of
stanzas, a necklace of pearls of good doctrine, which have for their
subject the distinction of the individual Soul and Brahman.

   <span id="pp_118"></span>118. If we have uttered through inadvertence
what is wrong, may the intelligent, observing it, correct all the <span
id="page_173">p. 173</span> errors; the feet of the traveller do
sometimes stumble, and sometimes the speaker speaks through bewilderment
what is incompatible.

   <span id="pp_119"></span>119. In a poem strung of all excellences the
mean man hunts for faults and never an excellence; in a palace all
compact of jewels it is the ant that will see a flaw.

   <span id="pp_120"></span>120. Let those who are envious and bereft of
sense, detect a fault if they will; but let the connoisseurs count the
merits; they who behold the merits and not the faults,--these are the
good, these give the highest satisfaction.

   <span id="pp_121"></span>121. Let this work of the poet Pûr.nânanda
be read and be heard, which is devoted to proving the difference of the
individual soul from the Supreme,--which is excellent with its sentences
that distinguish truth from falsehood, and is approved by the devotees
of Vish.nu,--based on the doctrine of Madhva, and pleasing with a
composition full of sweet words,--O ye best of the worshippers of
Bhagavat, if faith be desired in your minds.

   <span id="pp_122"></span>122. On the neck of the faithful may this
Tattvamuktâvalî<span id="page_173_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_173_note_1.md) abide for ever,--whose
beauty is increased by the apt arrangement of sweet and soft words but
which is free from rhetorical ornaments,--beautiful with a profusion of
sentences sweet like milk, and with its parts all bright and elegant,--a
special source of delight to the intelligent,--charming with a host of
excellences and devoid of even the trace of a fault.

<span id="page_137_note_2"></span>[2](#page_137_fr_2.md). As the different
systems are arranged in the Sarva D. S. according to their respective
relation to the Vedânta, we can easily understand why Mâdhava there
places these two systems so low down in the scale, and only just above
the atheistic schools of the Chârvâkas, Buddhists, and Jainas.

<span id="footnotes_page_138"></span>p. 138

<span id="page_138_note_1"></span>[1](#page_138_fr_1.md). No date is given.

<span id="page_138_note_2"></span>[2](#page_138_fr_2.md). Dr. Banerjea has
quoted and translated several stanzas in his 'Dialogues on Hindu
Philosophy.'

<span id="footnotes_page_155"></span>p. 155

<span id="page_155_note_1"></span>[1](#page_155_fr_1.md). The Bengali
translation explains these as the internal powers (*antara"ngâ*)
Hlâdinî, etc., and the external (*bahira"ngâ*) Prahvâ, etc.

<span id="page_155_note_2"></span>[2](#page_155_fr_2.md). There is a
favourite Naiyâyik example of a *kevalânvayi* middle term, "a jar is
nameable because it is cognizable as a web is."

<span id="page_155_note_3"></span>[3](#page_155_fr_3.md). Or *vedavishaye*
may perhaps simply mean *vede*, cf. šl. 112.

<span id="page_155_note_4"></span>[4](#page_155_fr_4.md). The author here
explains the sentence *tat tvam asi*, as really meaning *tasya tvam asi*
"thou art Its."

<span id="page_155_note_5"></span>[5](#page_155_fr_5.md). In "Thou art
that," 'thou' and 'that' would refer to the same subject
(*sâmânâdhikara.nya*).

<span id="footnotes_page_156"></span>p. 156

<span id="page_156_note_1"></span>[1](#page_156_fr_1.md). This is often
used as an illustration in Vedânta works, as *e.g.* B.rihad Âra.ny. Up.
ii. 1. 20, "as the spider proceeds with his web, as the little sparks
proceed from fire, so from this Soul proceed all vital airs, all worlds,
all gods, all beings."

<span id="page_156_note_2"></span>[2](#page_156_fr_2.md). This is another
suggested method of interpreting the words "I am Brahman." It may be
only a common case of "qualified superimponent indication," as "the man
of the Panjâb is an ox" (cf. Kâvya Prakâša, ii. 10-12). Cf. the
definition of upachâra in the Sâhitya Darpa.na: *upachâro hi
nâmâtyanta.m višakalitayoh šâd.rišyâtišayamahimnâ
bhedapratîtisthaganamâtram*.

<span id="footnotes_page_157"></span>p. 157

<span id="page_157_note_1"></span>[1](#page_157_fr_1.md). Dr. Banerjea
(*Dialogues*, p. 379) reads *kadâpy atyayajñânam, i.e.* vyabhichâra; but
all the MSS. which I have compared read *na kadâ vyatyaya* (or
*vyatyaya.m*) *jñânam*; *kadâ* seems irregularly used for *kadâpi*, as
it is also in šl. 113, *c*.

<span id="footnotes_page_158"></span>p. 158

<span id="page_158_note_1"></span>[1](#page_158_fr_1.md). In such sentences
as "That art thou," "I am Brahman," etc., the primary power of the
words, *i.e.* "Denotation" (*abhidhâ*), could not express the
unconditioned Brahman destitute of all attributes; for Denotation rests
upon the ordinary conventional meaning, and how could this take in an
idea so far removed from ordinary experience? Nor could it be the
secondary power "Indication" (*laksha.nâ*), as in the well-known
instance of "the herd-station on the Ganges," where the Ganges, by
"indication," means the shore and not the stream. For "indication" must
be based on some connexion between the primary and the indicated
secondary meaning; but how can that which is "without a second" be
connected with anything?

<span id="page_158_note_2"></span>[2](#page_158_fr_2.md). I suppose that
these are (1) the incompatibility of the primary sense; (2) the common
currency of the secondary meaning, *e.g.* when "Europe" is used to imply
its inhabitants in the phrase "Europe makes war:" (3) a motive, as in "a
herd-station on the Ganges," where "Ganges" is used instead of "the bank
of the Ganges," in order to imply the coolness and purity of the spot.

<span id="page_158_note_3"></span>[3](#page_158_fr_3.md). Cf. the Bengali
proverb *mâthâ nâi târ mâthâbyathâ*, "he has no head and yet he has a
headache."

<span id="footnotes_page_159"></span>p. 159

<span id="page_159_note_1"></span>[1](#page_159_fr_1.md). In the first ex.
there is *šuddha-sâropa-laksha.nâ* or "pure superimponent indication,"
in the second there is *šuddha-sâdhyavasâna-l.* or "pure introspeceptive
indication," where the ghî is swallowed up in the "life." Most writers,
however, disallow *upachâra* in *šuddha-laksha.nâ*.

<span id="page_159_note_2"></span>[2](#page_159_fr_2.md). He seems to imply
that each of these three requisites fails in the present case,--there is
no primary meaning, and still less a secondary, and there is no
connexion with any other object.

<span id="page_159_note_3"></span>[3](#page_159_fr_3.md). He now proceeds
to declare his own opinions.

<span id="page_159_note_4"></span>[4](#page_159_fr_4.md). Taitt. Upanish.
ii. 4.

<span id="footnotes_page_160"></span>p. 160

<span id="page_160_note_1"></span>[1](#page_160_fr_1.md). Cf. the Ka.tha
Up. vi. 12, "The soul is not to be reached by speech nor by the mind nor
by the eye."

<span id="page_160_note_2"></span>[2](#page_160_fr_2.md). For
*skhaladgati*, cf. *Kâvyaprakâša*, ii. 16.

<span id="page_160_note_3"></span>[3](#page_160_fr_3.md). This line is
quoted from Šruti in the Maitri Upanishad, vi. 22.

<span id="page_160_note_4"></span>[4](#page_160_fr_4.md). Cf.
Sâhityadarpa.na, ii. "On the old man's saying, when giving directions to
the middle-aged man," etc. The Sâhitya D. uses the terms *âvâpoddhârau*,
the Siddhântamuktâvalî (p. 80) uses *âvâpodvâpan*.

<span id="page_160_note_5"></span>[5](#page_160_fr_5.md). This is one of
the tenets of Râmânujas as well as Pûr.naprajñas.

<span id="page_160_note_6"></span>[6](#page_160_fr_6.md). The *vyâpâra* or
intermediate agency is defined as *taj-janyatve sati taj-janya-janako hi
vyâpâra.h*.

memorial line, *Šokamohau jarâm.rityû kshutpipâse sha.dûrmaya.h*.

<span id="page_161_note_2"></span>[2](#page_161_fr_2.md). With this curious
use of *akartum* (extending the analogy of such forms as *akurvan*,
*ak.ritvâ*, etc.) cf. Theognis, 621: {Greek: *pas tis ploúsion ándpa
tíei atíei dè penixrón*}. Cf. Shilleto, Cambridge Journ. of Philology,
1876, p. 161.

<span id="page_161_note_3"></span>[3](#page_161_fr_3.md). Could *loke* mean
that it will hold good "of the world" as his body?

<span id="page_161_note_4"></span>[4](#page_161_fr_4.md). Cf. "Whose body
nature is and God the soul."

<span id="page_161_note_5"></span>[5](#page_161_fr_5.md). *I.e.* he creates
the world to give their deserts to the different souls.

<span id="page_161_note_6"></span>[6](#page_161_fr_6.md). The objector
urges "why should our good or evil deserts oblige God to act in a
certain way?" He answers by referring to the well-known legend given in
the Bhâgavata Purâ.na, viii. ch. 2-4. A certain king, named Indradyumna,
became an elephant through Agastya's curse. One day, while drinking in a
lake, he was seized by a crocodile, and the struggle lasted for a
thousand years. At last, in despair, he prayed to Vish.nu, who came down
mounted on Garu.da and killed the crocodile. Thus we see that, although
in one sense the deserts of one being cannot attach themselves to
another, still they must cause certain actions in another being, or it
would be impossible that each should receive its due reward or
punishment.

<span id="page_162_note_1"></span>[1](#page_162_fr_1.md). These six
qualities, according to the Commentator on the Bhâgavata P. i. 3. 36,
are sovereignty, knowledge, glory, prosperity, dispassion, and virtue; a
different list is given in the Sarva Darš. S. p. 54, l. 22 (but cf. p.
69, l. 18). See also *infra* in šl. 95.

<span id="page_162_note_2"></span>[2](#page_162_fr_2.md). Rig V. i. 164,

merely looks on."

is *brahma.ny âtmanirîksha.nât*.

<span id="page_163_note_2"></span>[2](#page_163_fr_2.md). *I.e.* it would
be always *videre videntem*.

<span id="page_163_note_3"></span>[3](#page_163_fr_3.md). Cf. Hitopadeša,
Introd. šl. 45.

<span id="page_163_note_4"></span>[4](#page_163_fr_4.md). In Vedânta S. i.
2. 4, it is shown that certain passages in the Upanishads refer to
Brahman and not the embodied soul, "because of the application therein
of the terms object and agent;" as *e.g.* in the passage of the
Chhândogya Upan. iii. 14, "I shall attain it when I have departed from
hence." These words imply an agent who attains and also an object which
is attained, *i.e.* Brahman. Ša"nkara in his comment on i. 2. 11
illustrates this by the passage in the Katha Upanishad iii. 1, "The two,
drinking the due reward from their works, in this world entered the
cave, in the highest place of the supreme soul" (sc. the heart).

<span id="page_163_note_5"></span>[5](#page_163_fr_5.md). Cf. Vedânta
Sûtras i. 2. 6, where Ša"nkara quotes the passage from the Bhagavad Gîtâ
(xviii. 61), "The Lord of all beings abides in the region of the
heart,--causing all beings to revolve by his illusion as though mounted
on a machine."

<span id="page_163_note_6"></span>[6](#page_163_fr_6.md). He uses this very
expression *upâsyopâsakabhâva* in his Comment. on i. 2. 4.

<span id="footnotes_page_164"></span>p. 164

<span id="page_164_note_1"></span>[1](#page_164_fr_1.md). *I.e.* in the
word *jîvâtmânau*.

<span id="page_164_note_2"></span>[2](#page_164_fr_2.md). I suppose that
this means that the *dvandva* compound *d.rishadupala* has some analogy
to one like *jîvâtmânau*, which involves identity, as the upper and
lower millstone form one instrument; but there (in accordance with Pâ.n.
2. 2. 34, *vârtt.*) the less important word meaning the upper and
smaller stone (*upalâ*) is placed last (cf. 2. 2. 31).

<span id="page_164_note_3"></span>[3](#page_164_fr_3.md). But *jîvâtmânau*
is a *dvandva*, not a *karmadhâraya* compound.

<span id="page_164_note_5"></span>[5](#page_164_fr_5.md). *I.e.* this is
one of the modes of worshipping Brahman by meditating on him in some
lower visible form, not as really expressing his real nature.

<span id="page_166_note_2"></span>[2](#page_166_fr_2.md). This is an attack
on Râmânuja's system, as opposed to that of Pûr.naprajña or Madhva, cf.
Sarva-daršana S. p. 52, l. 20, "What is the real truth? The real truth
is plurality, unity, and both. Thus unity is admitted in saying that
Brahman alone subsists in all forms as all is its body; both unity and
plurality are admitted in saying that one only Brahman subsists under a
plurality of forms, diverse as soul and non-soul; and plurality is
admitted in saying that the essential natures of soul, non-soul, and the
Lord are different and not to be confounded." This doctrine is opposed
by the followers of Madhva, see *ibid*., Pûr.naprajña-darš. p. 61, l.
11.

<span id="footnotes_page_167"></span>p. 167

<span id="page_167_note_1"></span>[1](#page_167_fr_1.md). *I.e.* those
affecting the three "humours" of the body, *i.e.* *vâyu* 'wind,' *pitta*
'bile,' and *kapha* 'phlegm.' Certain flavours of the honey counteract
one disorder and others another. The Sušruta thus describes honey (vol.
i. p. 185): "When cooked it removes the three-fold disorders, but when
raw or sour it causes them; when used in various applications it cures
many disorders; and since it is composed of many different things it is
an excellent medium for mixing. But as it consists of the juices of
flowers which are mutually contrary in the action, potency, and
qualities of their various ingredients, and it may happen that poisonous
insects may be included, it is only good as a remedy for cold diseases."

<span id="page_167_note_2"></span>[2](#page_167_fr_2.md). In allusion to
Mu.n.d. Upan. iii. 2. 8.

<span id="page_167_note_3"></span>[3](#page_167_fr_3.md). Most of the MSS.
and the Benares Pa.n.dit read *kshîroda*; but the Calcutta ed. and one
of the two MSS. in the Library of the Calcutta Sanskrit College read
*kshâroda*, which seems preferable. If we read *kshîroda*, the line
would require to be rendered, "but from the difference between milk
mixed with water and pure water," or perhaps "from the difference
between the milk-ocean and the water-ocean."

<span id="page_168_note_2"></span>[2](#page_168_fr_2.md). The name
*šûnyavâda* is generally applied to Buddhism; here it is applied by way
of reproach to the Vedânta, which is called in the Padma-purâ.na "secret
Buddhism" (*prachchhanna.m Bauddham*).

occurs in Mahâbh. xii. 9604, ff.

<span id="page_168_note_5"></span>[5](#page_168_fr_5.md). The Râmânujas and
the Mâdhvas deny that the Supreme Being is *nirgu.na*,--thus there is a
quotation in the Sarva Daršana S. p. 64. "Vâsudeva is the supreme
Brahman, endowed with auspicious attributes" (cf. p. 69, l. 18; p. 73,
l. 2).

<span id="footnotes_page_169"></span>p. 169

<span id="page_169_note_1"></span>[1](#page_169_fr_1.md). This is the
*prastara* or bundle of sacred grass, which plays an important part in
the sacrificial ritual, cf. Taittirîya S. i. 7. 4, "*yajamâna.h
prastara.h*," where Sâya.na remarks, "*yajamânavad yâgasâdhanatvât
prastare yajamânatvopachâra.h*." This description of the grass as the
sacrificer is really only meant as metaphorical praise, since the actual
attributes of the sacrificer are evidently absent from the grass. (Cf.
Mîmâ.msâ Sûtras, i. 4. 23.)

<span id="page_169_note_2"></span>[2](#page_169_fr_2.md). Clearer insight
abolishes imagined attributes, as *e.g.* the supposed snake in the rope;
but real attributes remain untouched, and we hold Brahman's attributes
to be real.--I read *abâdha.h* in I. 2.

<span id="footnotes_page_170"></span>p. 170

<span id="page_170_note_1"></span>[1](#page_170_fr_1.md). I do not know
where this passage occurs, but the kindred word *satyadharman* is
applied to several deities in the Rigveda.

<span id="page_170_note_2"></span>[2](#page_170_fr_2.md). The Vedântins
hold that nothing exists besides Brahman; and yet, although they thus
deny the existence of any other thing or quality, they hold that certain
qualities are imagined to exist in him, forgetting that only one who has
seen silver can imagine *rajatatva* in nacre.

<span id="page_170_note_3"></span>[3](#page_170_fr_3.md). It is a favourite
doctrine of the Vedânta that ignorance, as being imagined by ignorance,
is itself false.

<span id="page_170_note_4"></span>[4](#page_170_fr_4.md). Manu, i. 80,
"There are numberless Manvantaras, creations and destructions
numberless; the being supremely exalted performs all this, as in sport,
again and again."

<span id="footnotes_page_171"></span>p. 171

<span id="page_171_note_1"></span>[1](#page_171_fr_1.md). Or this may mean
"since Vish.nu has accepted it as the instrument of his sport."

<span id="page_171_note_2"></span>[2](#page_171_fr_2.md). "The *prasâda* is
any article of food that has been consecrated by previous presentation
to an idol, after which it is distributed among the worshippers on the
spot, or sent to persons of consequence at their own houses" (Wilson's
Works, vol. 1. p. 116). Cf. also the legend in p. 134, where "Râm Dâs at
noon halted and bathed the god, and prepared his food, and presented it,
and then took the *prasâd*, and put it in a vessel, and fed upon what
remained." (The food consecrated at the temple of Puri is especially
called the *Mahâprasâda*.) There is a distich current among the Bhâktas:

<span id="page_171_note_3"></span>[3](#page_171_fr_3.md). But the true
devotee is neither devoted to enjoyment nor to dispassion, is equally
apart from and superior to both.

<table data-align="center">

<col style="width: 100%" />

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

"Knowledge is rejection; abandon Brahman and worship Vish.nu. Here where
even the homage paid to the *prasâda* counts as faith, what need to
mention anything besides?" Thus the devotee does everything by faith,
and dispassion and enjoyment are to him alike swallowed up in faith.

<span id="page_172_note_1"></span>[1](#page_172_fr_1.md). Cf. Sarva D. S.
p. 52, l. 8 infr. "The statements that the Supreme Spirit is devoid of
qualities, are intended to deny his possession of phenomenal qualities
\[such as liking, disliking, etc.\]."
