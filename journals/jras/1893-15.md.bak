ART XV.--*Hebrew Visions of Hell and Paradise*. By M. GASTER, Ph.D.

THE recent recovery of the Revelation of St. Peter has again attracted
attention to this branch of apocalyptic literature. Speculation has been
rife as to the sources of that Revelation.

   I intend publishing now, for the first time in English garb, the
oldest extant Revelations which must have served as source to that of
Peter, then to that of Paul, Ezra, Abraham, Isaiah, Virgin Mary, St.
Macarius, and the host of others down to Dante and St. Patrick.

   It is not here the place to enter into a more minute disquisition of
the history of these visions. We find parallels in the old Ægyptian
literature, in the Assyrian we have the well-known "Descensus ad
inferos" of Izdubar (Nimrud). The Buddhist literature knows the
Suh.rllekha, [the letter of Nâgârjuna to King Udayana](../jpts/nfe.md). In
the Avesta literature we have the [Nameh of
Arda-viraf](https://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/viraf.html.md); in the
Mahommedan we have the vision of Mahommed. All these Christian
Revelations and of the others, at any rate the last two, are based
directly upon those Hebrew visions, a fact which has hitherto not been
noticed.

   I reserve for a book, which I am writing, the fuller discussion of
these points, and the study of the internal connection between these
apocalyptic visions.

   It would be bold to speculate on the relative age of each of the
visions which I publish here. They all go back to the pre-Christian age,
as is shown by the existence of those Christian visions almost verbally
identical with the Hebrew. On the other hand one cannot doubt that they
underwent some changes in the course of the ages. The substance <span
id="page_572">p. 572</span> remained intact, but many passages were
interpolated or omitted. The different texts complement thus each other
to assist us to arrive at a probable common source. The tendency of all
these popular writings is to grow in the course of time, to attract and
to assimilate various elements. We can see this process very clearly in
the Revelation of Moses, which has been hitherto almost unknown. It has
nothing in common with those known under that title. We have two
recensions of it. A shorter one, and a longer which is more amplified
and contains interpolations taken from the Zohar and the Talmud. Whether
the biblical passages belonged originally to these visions is still a
matter of doubt. They may have been tacked on to the narrative as a kind
of scriptural proof, or they may stand as the beginning of a series of
details and pictures which have been evolved out of them, by a rather
fantastical exegesis, but by no means uncommon in the Oriental
literature.

   To each text I have added a full bibliography, and parallels from
most of the extant apocryphal revelations. I have striven to be as
literal as possible. The attempt to obliterate the Oriental touch by a
polished translation, robs the text of its originality and local colour,
which ought to be preserved.

 

<span id="I">I</span>. THE REVELATION OF MOSES. (A.)

*Heaven, Hell, and Paradise*.

(*Gedulath Mosheh*, Amsterdam, 1854, v. Jellinek, Beth-hammidrash, II.
pp. x., xiv. ff., and xix-xx.)

   <span id="I:1">1</span>. \[As the apple tree among the trees of the
wood, so is my beloved among the sons ([Song of Songs, ii.
3](../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003).md). (This applies to Moses, upon whom be
peace.)\]

   <span id="I:2">2</span>. In that hour when God said unto him: "Go and
bring out the children of Israel from Egypt, for I have heard their
groaning, and I remembered the covenant, and the oath I swore to Abraham
my <span id="page_573">p. 573</span> servant." Moses said: "O Lord of
the Universe, who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should
bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?" ([Ex. iii.
11](../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#010).md). God said: "Thou hast humbled thyself
in saying 'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh?' but I will honour thee
\[as it is said: 'He that is of lowly spirit shall obtain honour'
([Prov. xxix. 23](../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#023).md)\], and I will give the
whole of Egypt into thy hands, and I will bring thee up even near to my
throne of glory; and I will shew thee the angels of the Heaven."
Thereupon God commanded Metatron, the angel of his presence (of the
face), and said unto him: "Go and bring Moses with harps, and pipes, and
drums, and dances, with joy, and songs, and praises."

   <span id="I:3">3</span>. And Metatron answered and said: "O Lord of
the Universe, Moses is not able to come up and see the angels, for there
are angels who are of fire and he is only of flesh and blood."

   <span id="I:4">4</span>. God said: "Go and change his flesh (body)
into fire." And Metatron went to Moses.

   <span id="I:5">5</span>. When Moses beheld Metatron he trembled with
fear, and said to him: "Who art thou?"

   <span id="I:6">6</span>. And he answered: "I am Enoch the son of
Jared, thy father's father. The Almighty hath sent me to bring thee up
to his throne of glory."<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:7">7</span>. Moses said: "I am only flesh and blood, and
cannot look upon the angels." And Metatron changed Moses' tongue into a
tongue of fire, and his eyes he made like the wheels of the heavenly
chariot, and his power like unto that of the angels, and his tongue like
a flame, and brought him up to heaven. 15,000 angels were on the right
hand, and 15,000 on the left, Metatron and Moses in the middle. In this
way was Moses carried up to heaven.<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

Cambridge, 1892.\]

<span id="page_574">p. 574</span>

   <span id="I:8">8</span>. The first heaven to which Moses ascended
corresponds to the first day of the week; there he saw the waters
standing in lines. This heaven was full of windows, and at each window
stood an angel. And Moses asked Metatron: "What are these windows?" and
Metatron answered: "These windows are the window of prayer, the window
of request, the window of supplication, the window of crying (tears),
the window of joy, the window of satiation, the window of famine, the
window of poverty, the window of riches, the window of war, the window
of peace, the window of pregnancy, the window of birth, the window of
the treasures of rain, the window of dew, the window of sin, the window
of repentance, the window of smallness, the window of greatness, the
window of death, the window of life, the window of disease among men,
the window of disease among animals, the window of healing, the window
of sickness, the window of health." And Moses saw great things past
finding out, "yea marvellous things without number" ([Job ix.
10](../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#010).md).<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:9">9</span>. Moses ascended then the second heaven, which
corresponds to the second day of the week. There he saw an angel whose
name is X.<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> His length is 300
parasangs and 50 myriads of angels stand before him; they are of fire
and water, and their faces are directed towards the *Shekina* above; and
all sing hymns, saying: "Great is the Lord and highly to be praised"
([cxlv. 3](../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#003).md).

   <span id="I:10">10</span>. And Moses asked Metatron and said: "Who
are those?" He answered: "These are the angels who are placed over the
clouds, the wind, and the rain; they go and fulfil the will of their
Creator and return to their places and praise the Almighty."

<span class="small"></span>

Raziel*, Amsterdam, 1701; f. 34<sup><span class="small">b</span></sup>
ff.

2\. In this recension the names of the angels are omitted. They are to
be found, however, in the shorter.\]

<span id="page_575">p. 575</span> And Moses asked: "Why have they their
faces turned towards the Shekina?" And Metatron answered: "From that day
when God created them until to-day they have not been moved from their
position."<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:11">11</span>. Moses went up to the third heaven, which
corresponds to the third day of the week. There he saw an angel whose
name is X. His length is a journey of 500 years. He has 70,000 heads, in
each head 70,000 mouths, in each mouth 70,000 tongues, and in each
tongue 70,000 dictions; before him stand 70,000 myriads of angels, all
of white fire; they all praise and sing to God \[and say: "Thine, O
Lord, is the greatness and power," etc. ([1 Chr. xxix.
11](../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#011).md)\].

   <span id="I:12">12</span>. Moses asked Metatron: "Who are these? and
what is their name?" And he answered: "Their name is *Erelim*; they are
placed over the grass (herbs), and over the trees, and over the fruits,
and over the corn; and they all go and fulfil the will of their Creator
and return to their places."

   <span id="I:13">13</span>. Moses went up to the fourth heaven. There
he saw the temple built; the columns of red fire, the sides of green
fire, the thresholds of white fire, the hooks and the planks of blazing
fire; the portals of carbuncle and the halls of sparkling gems. And he
saw angels going therein praising (and saying) \[as King David, upon
whom may peace rest, said: "Bless the Lord, ye angels of His, ye mighty
in strength, that fulfil his word" ([Ps. ciii.
20](../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020).md)\].<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:14">14</span>. Moses asked Metatron and said: "Who are
these angels?" And Metatron answered: "These are the angels, who are
placed over the earth, and over the sun, and over the moon, and over the
stars, and over the planets, and over the spheres, and ever sing they
hymns unto Him." And he saw two big stars, each

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Enoch, *l.c.*; Jubilees, *l.c.*

2\. Testament Levi, ch. 5.\]

<span id="page_576">p. 576</span> of them as big as the whole earth; the
name of one was *Nogah*, and the name of the other *Maadim*, one
standing above the sun, and the other above the moon. Moses asked
Metatron: "Why do these stand above those others?" And he said: "The one
stands above the sun in summer in order to cool the world from the heat
of the sun, and that is the star *Nogah*; whilst the other stands near
the moon in order to warm the world from the cold of the moon (and this
is the star *Maadim*)."<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:15">15</span>. Moses went to the fifth heaven and he saw
there troops of angels half of fire and half of snow, and the snow is
above the fire without extinguishing it, for God makes peace between
them \[as it is said: "He maketh peace in his high places," [Job xxv.
2](../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#002.md)\], and all praise the Almighty.

   <span id="I:16">16</span>. And Moses asked Metatron: "What are these
doing?" He said: "Since the day when God created them are they so."
Moses asked: "What is their name?" and he answered: "These are the
*Erelim* who are called *Ishim* \[as it is said: 'Unto you, O Ishim
(men), I call,' [Prov. viii. 4](../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#004.md); *i.e.*: I
call you Ishim!\]."

   <span id="I:17">17</span>. Moses went up to the sixth heaven, there
he saw an angel whose length was 500 years' journey; his name was X.,
and he was wholly of *hail* (ice), and by him stood thousands and
myriads of angels, without number, and all sung praises to the One who
said and the world was created \[as it is said: the heaven proclaim the
glory of God ([Ps. xix. 2](../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#002).md)\].<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:18">18</span>. Moses asked Metatron: "Who are these?" and
he answered: "These are the *Irin Kadishin*, the holy watchers,"
([Daniel iv. 10-14](../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#010).md).

   <span id="I:19">19</span>. Moses went up to the seventh heaven, and
he saw an angel wholly of fire; and two angels, whose names were X.
These were fastened with two chains of red

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Cf. Pirke de R. Eliezer, ch. 6.

2\. Ch. 8-17, cf. Othioth de R. Akiba (Jellinek, Bet-hamm. III.
20-21).\]

<span id="page_577">p. 577</span> and dark fire; and each of them had
the length of 500 parasangs.

   <span id="I:20">20</span>. Moses asked Metatron: "Who are these?" And
he answered: "These are wrath and anger, and God created them during the
six days of creation, that they should fulfil his will."<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:21">21</span>. Moses replied: "I am afraid of these
angels, and I cannot look on them." Thereupon Metatron embraced Moses,
placed him in his bosom and said: "O Moses, beloved of God, be not
frightened nor dread thou aught." And Moses was immediately calmed.

   <span id="I:22">22</span>. After this Moses saw another angel, whose
countenance was totally different from those of the other angels, for he
was ugly and his height of 540 years' journey, and he was girded forty
times around his waist. From the sole of the foot unto the head he was
full of fiery eyes, and whosoever looked at him, fell down in dread.

   <span id="I:23">23</span>. And Moses asked Metatron: "Who is this?"
He answered: "This is the angel of death, who takes the souls of
men."<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> And he asked him:
"Where is he now going?" And Metatron answered: "He goes to take the
soul of Job the pious."

   <span id="I:24">24</span>. And Moses said before God: "May it be thy
will, O Lord, my God and God of my fathers, that thou shouldst not
deliver me into the hands of this angel!"

   <span id="I:25">25</span>. Then saw he angels standing before God;
each of them having six wings. With twain wings they covered their
faces, so that they might not look upon the *Shekina*. With the other
twain wings they cover their feet, for they have the feet of a calf, and
with the other twain wings they fly and praise God. The length of each
wing is 500 years' journey, and the width from one end of the world

<span id="page_578">p. 578</span> to the other. And Moses asked: "Who
are these?" and Metatron answered: "These are the holy
Creatures."<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:26">26</span>. \[Our sages tell<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> that at the time when Nebuchadnezzar
the impious said: "I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will
be like the Most High" (Isaiah xv. 14 {*sic*. [Isaiah xiv.
14](../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#014)}.md), the Holy Spirit came forth and
said: "O impious man! How many are the days of the years of thy life?
Threescore and ten, or even by reason of strength, fourscore years"
([Ps. xc. 10](../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010).md), and the distance from
earth to heaven alone is 500 years, the thickness of the heaven again
500 years, and from the heaven Rakia to the heaven Shehakim 500 years,
and its thickness 500 years, and from Shehakim to Zebul again 500 years,
and its thickness 500 years, and from Zebul to Meon 500 years, and its
thickness 500 years, and from Meon to Araboth 500 years, and its
thickness 500 years, and the feet of the holy Creatures are equal to the
whole; and their ankles are equal to the whole; and the wings of the
creatures are like the whole, and their necks are like the whole, and
their heads like the whole, and their horns like unto the whole, and
upon them is the throne of glory which is equal to the whole. \[It is
like the terrible ice, [Ezek. i. 22](../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#022.md).\]
And there sits the King of Kings, the Holy, blessed be He exalted and
high, and thou sayest: "I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I
will be like the Most High! Woe unto thee, O impious man and woe unto
thy soul, for thou shalt be brought down to the uttermost parts of the
pit (cf. [Isaiah xiv. 15](../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#015).md) to the seven
regions of hell to be punished for ever and ever."\]

class="small">b</span></sup>.\]

<span id="page_579">p. 579</span>

   <span id="I:27">27</span>. And after that Moses saw an angel in the
heaven called Araboth, *i.e.* the seventh heaven, and this angel was
teaching the souls which were created by God at the time of the Creation
and have been placed in paradise. The name of the angel was X. He
teaches them in seventy languages in the college on high, and they
answer: "Thus is the law of Moses given by tradition from Mount Sinai
\[as it is said Dina was set and the books were opened ([Daniel vii.
10](../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010).md), and Dina is none other than this
angel, who is the guardian angel of the Law and of wisdom." He has also
another name, they call him Jefefiyah, for the name of the guardian
angel of the Law is Iofiel\].<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:28">28</span>. \[(From the Zohar) R. Simeon, son of
Johai, said: "At that time when Moses went up to heaven an angel sat
before him and taught him 370 mysteries of the Law, Moses then said to
God, 'I will not depart from here unless Thou wilt give me good gifts.'"
God answered: "Moses, my servant, faithful in my house, I will give thee
my Law wherein are good gifts, as it is written: 'For I gave thee a good
gift' ([Prov. iv. 2](../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#002).md). Therein are also
the commandments, positive and negative, and not only this (I grant
thee) but also that the Law shall be recorded in thy name, as it is
written: 'Remember ye the Law of Moses, my servant' ([Malachi iii.
22](../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#022).md)." Whence do we know that Moses did
actually ascend seven heavens? We learn it from the verse, "And Moses
ascended to God." (It is further written, "God went up amidst the sounds
of trumpets") ([Ps. xlvii. 6](../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#006).md). Moses is
therefore called Elohim like unto his Master, for it is said: "See I
have made thee as Elohim unto Pharaoh," therefore it is written: "Like
an apple-tree in the wood is my beloved among the sons." This is Moses,
master of the Prophets and servant of God; he is like an apple in odour
and taste.\]

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. About *seven heavens* v. Ascensio Isaiae and Test. Levi, ch. 3.\]

<span id="page_580">p. 580</span>

   <span id="I:29">29</span>. At that time a *Bath-Kol* came forth from
underneath the throne of glory and said: "Moses, my servant! Art thou
afraid of them?" \[It is written: "A wise man scaleth the city of the
mighty and bringeth down the strength of the confidence thereof" ([Prov.
xxi. 22](../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#022).md). Strength means the Law as it is
said: "God will give strength to his people" ([Ps. xxix.
11](../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#011).md).\]

   <span id="I:30">30</span>. God said then to Moses: "Moses, my
servant! Thou camest up here and hast been worthy of the privilege of
seeing all with thy (earthly) power; and I have made thee ascend seven
heavens, and have shown thee my treasures and I have given thee my law.
Now thou shalt be worthy of seeing the two parks I have created in this
world, one for the righteous and one for the sinners, viz. Paradise and
Hell."

   <span id="I:31">31</span>. At that hour God sent Gabriel and said
unto him: "Go with my beloved servant Moses and show him Hell!"

   <span id="I:32">32</span>. And Moses said to him: "I cannot enter
Hell, that blazing fire." He said to him: "Moses, there is a fire which
burns more than all the seven Hells, and yet when thou wilt tread it
with thy feet, it shall not burn thee."

   <span id="I:33">33</span>. At an hour when Moses entered Hell, the
fire of Hell withdrew for 500 parasangs. The master of Hell said to him:
"Who art thou?" He answered: "I am the son of Amram." The Lord of Hell
answered: "Not here is thy place." And Moses said: "I came to see the
powerful works of God, blessed be He." And God said to the Lord of Hell:
"Go and show him how men are in Hell."<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. I draw attention here to two more apocalyptic visions which do not
seem to have been noticed hitherto. (1) The apocalypse of the Virgin
*Mary* (v. *Tischendorf*, Apoc. Apocryphae, p. xxvii.; *Gaster*,
Literatura populara românºa, Bucharest, 1883, p. 362-366; B. P.
*Hasdeu*, Cuvente d. B¯atr¯anºi, II. Bucharest, 1879, p. 301-367) extant
in Slavonic texts of the twelfth century. Greek, Roumanian, etc.;
Æthiopic and Syriac? In this text the tortures of Hell are very fully
described. (2) *Questions of St. Macarius*, of which I possess 6,
*Roumanian* MSS.; A *Syriac* Fragment of the twelfth century I found in
the British Museum, Add. 17,262 (*Wright*, II. p. 867-8, No. 837), and a
Greek text of the fifteenth century I discovered in Cod. Baroccianus
(Bodleian), No. 147. f. 294<sup><span class="small">b</span></sup>
*sqq*.\]

<span id="page_581">p. 581</span>

   <span id="I:34">34</span>. Immediately he went with Moses, like a
pupil before his master, and entered Hell together with him.

   <span id="I:35">35</span>. Moses saw there men tortured by the angels
of destruction. Some of the sinners were hanged by their eyelids, some
by their ears, some by their hands, and others by their tongues, and
they cried bitterly. And he saw women hanging by their hair and by their
breasts and in such like ways, all were hanging by chains of
fire.<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:36">36</span>. And Moses asked the Lord of Hell, and said
"Why are these hanged by their eyes and by their tongues and are so
fearfully tortured and so sorely punished?" And the master of Hell
answered: "Because they looked with an evil eye at fair women, and at
married women, and at the money of their friends and neighbours, and
gave false witness against their neighbours."<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:37">37</span>. Also saw he in Hell men hanging by their
sexual organs and their hands were tied, and he asked: "Why do these
hang?" The Lord answered: "Because they committed adultery, and stole,
and killed, and murdered."<sup><span class="small">\[3\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:38">38</span>. He saw other men hanging by their ears and
their tongues, and he asked: "Why are these hanging by their ears and
tongues?" And he answered: "Because they neglected the study of the law,
and talked slander and vain words and empty words.<sup><span
class="small">\[4\]</span></sup> The women are hanging by their hair and
breasts, because they used to uncover their breasts and their hair
before the young men and desired them, and came thus to sin."<sup><span
class="small">\[5\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:39">39</span>. Hell cried then with a bitter and loud
voice, and said to the Master of Hell: "Give me the sinners, that

always hungry and never satisfied, and crieth always for the sinners to
devour them, but hath no power over the righteous.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:40">40</span>. Moses went further and saw two sinners
hanged by their feet with their heads downwards, and they cried by
reason of the torture of Hell, and their bodies were covered with black
worms, each worm 500 parasangs long. And these sinners cry and lament,
saying: "Woe unto us, for the terrible punjshment of Hell; would we
could die." But they cannot die \[as it is said: "They long for death
but it cometh not" ([Job iii.
21](../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#021).md)\].<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:41">41</span>. Moses asked the master of Hell: "What acts
have these committed?" And he answered: "These are those who swore
falsely, and profaned the Sabbath, and despised the learned, and
persecuted the orphans; and gave bad names to their neighbours, and bare
false witness. Therefore hath God delivered them to these worms to take
vengeance on these sinners." And Moses asked: "What is the name of this
place?" And he answered: "Aluka \[as it is said; Aluka hath two
daughters" ([Prov. xxx. 15](../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015).md)\].<sup><span
class="small">\[3\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:42">42</span>. Moses went then to another place. There
the sinners were lying on their faces; and he saw two thousand scorpions
swarming over them and stinging them and torturing them, and the sinners
cried bitterly. Each scorpion has 70,000 mouths, and each mouth 70,000
stings, and each sting has 70,000 vesicles filled with poison and venom,
and with these are the sinners imbued and thus are they tortured; and
their eyes are sunk in their sockets for fear and dread, and their cry:
"Woe unto us, for our sins, and for the day of judgment."<sup><span

<span id="page_583">p. 583</span>

   <span id="I:43">43</span>. And Moses asked: "What have these
committed?" And he answered: "These have wasted the money of others;
they have taken bribery, and elevated themselves above others; they have
put their neighbours publicly to shame; they have delivered up their
brother Israelite to the gentile;<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> they denied the oral Law and maintained
that God did not create the world. Therefore God has handed them over to
the scorpions to be avenged on them."<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:44">44</span>. He saw there another place where the
sinners stood up to their knees; the name of that place is *Tit hayaven*
("miry clay," [Ps. xl. 3](../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003).md). Angels of
destruction tie them up with chains of iron and lash them with fiery
whips, and they take fiery stones and break with them the teeth of the
sinners, from morning until evening, and during the night they prolong
their teeth again to the length of a parasang in order to break them
anew next morning; \[as it is said: "Thou hast broken the teeth of the
wicked" ([Ps. iii. 8](../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008).md)\]. And the sinners
cry: "Woe unto us, woe unto us!" but nobody takes pity on
them.<sup><span class="small">\[3\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:45">45</span>. Moses asked the master of Hell: "What have
these committed?" He answered: "They ate all kinds of forbidden fruit
and gave them to Israelites to eat; they were usurers, and apostates and
blasphemers; they wrote the ineffable name of God for
Gentiles;<sup><span class="small">\[4\]</span></sup> they had false
weights; they stole money, and ate on the fast day of Kippur \[for
whosoever eats blood, or reptiles, or worms, and does not keep away from

Hell, and therefore God hath delivered them to the angels of destruction
to chastise them.<sup><span class="small">\[5\]</span></sup>

   <span id="I:46">46</span>. \[He saw there further how they punish the
wicked with fire and snow; and torture them terribly.\] The Lord of Hell
said then to Moses: "Come and see how the wicked are punished in Hell
with fire." Moses answered: "I dread to go." But the Lord of Hell
answered: "Go and dread naught," \[as it is said: "Yea, though I walk
through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil" ([Ps.
xxiii. 4](../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004).md)\].

   <span id="I:47">47</span>. And Moses stood up to go, and he saw the
*Shekina* moving before him, so that he should not be in dread of the
angels of destruction. Each of these is full of eyes, and hath fiery
chains in his hands, and his length is 500 years' journey.

   <span id="I:48">48</span>. Moses went and saw how the wicked were
punished by fire, being half in fire and half in snow, with worms
crawling up and down their bodies and a fiery collar round their necks,
and having no rest,<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> except on
Sabbath days and Festival days.<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> All (the other) days they are tortured
in Hell. Of these speaks the verse: "And they shall go forth and look
upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me, for
their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched" (Isaiah
cxvi. 28 {*sic* [lxvi. 24](../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#028)}.md).

   <span id="I:49">49</span>. And Moses asked the angel of Hell: "What
have these committed?" And the angel answered: "This is the punishment
for those who have committed adultery, sodomy, idolatry, and murder, and
who have cursed their parents. Therefore hath God delivered them to the
angels of destruction to be avenged on them."<sup><span
class="small">\[3\]</span></sup> And Moses asked: "What is the name of
this place?" And he answered: "The name of it is Abadon."

   <span id="I:50">50</span>. Thereupon Moses went up (to heaven) and
said: "May it be Thy will, O Lord, my God, and God

<span id="page_585">p. 585</span> of my fathers, that Thou mayest save
me and Thy people Israel from those places which I have seen in Hell."

   <span id="I:51">51</span>. God said to Moses: "Moses, my servant? I
have created two parks: Paradise and Hell. Whosoever committeth evil
deeds goeth down to Hell, and whosoever doth good deeds cometh into
Paradise" \[as it is said: "I the Lord search the heart, I try the
reins, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the
fruit of his doings " ([Jer. xvii. 10](../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010).md)\].

   <span id="I:52">52</span>. Then Moses lifted up his eyes and beheld
the angel Gabriel; and he fell down and bowed himself before him. And
the angel said: "Hast thou seen Hell?" He answered: "Yea." And the angel
said: "Come then, I will show thee Paradise, by the will of God." So
Moses went with him to Paradise.

   <span id="I:53">53</span>. When they came there, the angels said:
"Thy time is not yet arrived to leave the world." Moses answered: "I
came to see the mighty deeds of God, and the reward of the pious in
Paradise, what is their condition there."

   <span id="I:54">54</span>. The angels began then to praise Moses and
they said: "Hail, O Moses, servant of the Lord; Hail, O Moses, born of
woman, who hast been found worthy to ascend seven heavens, hail the
nation to whom such belongs." \[{Hebrew: *AKhKhS*} *such* in
arithmetical calculation is equal to {Hebrew: *ASM*}.\]

   <span id="I:55">55</span>. When Moses went into Paradise he saw an
angel sitting under the tree of life. Moses asked the angel Gabriel:
"Who is this angel?" He answered: "This is the Lord (guardian) of
Paradise and his name is X."

   <span id="I:56">56</span>. This angel then asked Moses: "Who art
thou?" He answered: "I am the son of Amram." He said to him: "Why didst
thou come hither?" And Moses answered: "To see the reward of the pious
in Paradise have I come hither."

<span id="page_586">p. 586</span>

   <span id="I:57">57</span>. The angel took Moses by the hand, and they
went both together. Moses looked up and saw seventy thrones fixed, one
next to another; all made of precious stones, of emerald, sapphire and
diamond and precious pearls, and the foot of each was of gold and fine
gold. Around each throne stood seventy angels. Amongst the thrones was
one greater than the others, and twenty of the ministering angels kept
ward thereover.

   <span id="I:58">58</span>. Moses enquired of the angel and said:
"Whose is that throne?" He answered: "It is the throne of Abraham the
Patriarch."

   <span id="I:59">59</span>. Thereupon Moses went immediately up to
Abraham. Abraham asked him: "Who art thou?" He answered: "I am the son
of Amram." And Abraham asked: "Is perchance already thy time come to
leave the world?" Moses answered: "My time is not yet come, but with the
permission of God I came to see the reward of the pious."<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> Abraham then said: "Praise ye the Lord,
for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever" ([Ps. cvi.
1](../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001).md).

   <span id="I:60">60</span>. Then went Moses to the throne of Isaac,
and he spake with him in a similar manner, and Moses answered in like
wise.

   <span id="I:61">61</span>. Then asked Moses, the guardian angel of
Paradise: "What is the length and width of Paradise?" The angel
answered: "There is none who could measure it; no angel or Seraph can
ever know the length and width of Paradise, for it is unlimited and
boundless and immeasurable. The angels guard only the thrones and these
are unlike to one another, for some of them are of silver, others of
gold, others of bdellium, others of ruby, topaz, and carbuncle, others
of emerald, sapphire and diamond, others of precious stones and pearls,
others of rubies and carbuncles."

   <span id="I:62">62</span>. Moses asked the angel: "For whom is the
throne of pearls?" He answered: "It is for the scholars

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Cf. Ascensio Isaiae, viii. 27, 28.\]

<span id="page_587">p. 587</span> who study the Law day and night for
the sake of heaven." "And those of precious stones?" "For the pious
men." "And those of rubies?" "For the just." "And those of gold?" "For
the men who repent;" "but the greatest throne is for thy forefather
Abraham, the other thrones are for Isaac and Jacob, and for the prophets
and righteous, and the holy and wise pious men, each after his worth and
position and the good works he hath performed in the world."

   <span id="I:63">63</span>. Moses then said to the angel: "For whom is
that throne of copper?" He answered: "For the wicked man, whose son is
pious; because through the merits of his son he obtains a portion of
heavenly bliss; as thou seest in the case of Terah, who had worshipped
all the idols in the world, but who through the merits of his son
Abraham obtained that throne of copper \[as it is said: "Thou shalt go
to thy fathers in peace" ([Gen. xv. 15](../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#015).md),
thus announcing to him (Abraham) that God would give (his father also) a
place in Paradise\]."

   <span id="I:64">64</span>. Afterwards Moses looked and beheld a
spring of living water welling forth from underneath the tree of life
and dividing itself into four streams, \[and it comes from under the
throne of glory\] and they encompass the Paradise from one end to the
other. And under each throne there flow four rivers, one of honey, the
second of milk, the third of wine, and the fourth of pure
balsam.<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> These all pass
beneath the feet of the just, who are seated upon thrones.

   <span id="I:65">65</span>. \[It is said in the Zohar. King Messias
said to R. Simeon, son of Johai: "Worthy art thou of thy portion in
heaven, for thy teaching is divided (spread) through 670 heavens, each
heaven is divided into 670 lights, each light is divided in 670
arguments, each argument is divided in (among) 670 worlds, each world is
divided in 670 streams of pure balsam.\]

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Paul, ch. 23.\]

<span id="page_588">p. 588</span>

   <span id="I:66">66</span>. And all these streams flow round Paradise
and beneath all the thrones. All these were created by God for the just,
and whoso becometh equal to them in merit, sees and enjoys, as they
enjoy, the splendour of the Shekina.

   <span id="I:67">67</span>. When Moses saw all these godly and
pleasant things he felt great joy, and exclaimed: "Oh! how great is Thy
goodness which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee, which Thou
hast wrought for them that put their trust in Thee, before the sons of
men" (Ps. xxxi. 19 {*sic* [xxxi. 20](../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020)}.md).

   <span id="I:68">68</span>. And Moses retired from there and went
away. At that same moment a voice from Heaven (Bath-Kol) was heard
saying: "Moses, servant of the Lord, faithful in His house; even as thou
hast seen the reward which is preserved for the just in the future
world, so also in the days to come shalt thou see the rebuilding of the
Temple and the advent of the Messiah, and behold the beauty of the Lord,
and meditate in His Temple" ([Ps. xxvii.
4](../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004).md). (May it now be Thy will, O Lord, my
God and the God of my fathers, that I and the whole nation of Israel may
be deemed worthy of sharing in good and the great consolation, and the
days of the Messiah, and the rebuilding of the Temple, and the
everlasting life. Amen.)

   <span id="II:1">1</span>. Moses, our teacher, upon whom may rest
peace, said to Israel: "Hear, O Israel, you the whole nation! I went up
on high, and I saw all the Heavenly rulers. I saw <span id="page_589">p.
589</span> the angel *Kemuel*, the Janitor, who is placed over 12,000
angels of destruction, and who stands at the gates of heaven.

   <span id="II:2">2</span>. I saw further the angel *Hadarniel*, who is
higher by 60 myriads of parasangs than Kemuel, and with every diction
that comes out of his mouth go forth 12,000 flashes of lightning.

   <span id="II:3">3</span>. I saw further *Sandalfon*, the prince,
greater than Hadarniel by 500 years' journey. Of him said Ezekiel: "One
wheel upon the earth besides the living Creatures, for each of the four
faces thereof" ([Ezek. i. 15](../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#015).md).

   <span id="II:4">4</span>. \[This is the Sandalfon who weaves crowns
for his master. When this crown appears before the heavenly hosts, they
all shake and tremble and the holy Creatures are struck dumb, and the
holy Seraphim roar like lions, and they say: "Holy, holy, holy is the
Lord of Hosts, the whole earth is full of his glory" ([Is. vi.
2](../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002).md). And when the crown approaches the
throne the wheels of the throne of glory move, and the thresholds of
brilliancy quake, and all the heavens are seized with terror. And when
the crown passes on to the throne of glory to its right place all the
heavenly hosts open their mouths, turn to the Seraphim and say: "Blessed
be the glory of the Lord from his place." They say: "From his place"
([Ezek. iii. 12](../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012).md), because they do not
know His actual place. When the crown comes near to God's head He
accepts it graciously from His servants. And the heavenly Creatures and
the Seraphim, and the wheels of the throne of glory, and the heavenly
hosts, and the Hashmalim and Cherubim praise the Creator, acknowledge
him as their king, and exclaim unanimously: "The Lord reigneth, the Lord
reigned, the Lord will reign for evermore."\]<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="II:5">5</span>. I saw further the fiery river *Rigyon*,
which comes out before God, from under the throne of glory, and is
formed from the perspiration of the holy Creatures who support the
throne of glory; and out of dread of God's majesty perspire
fire.<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> This river is meant by
the saying

<span id="page_590">p. 590</span> "a fiery stream issued and came forth
before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand
times ten thousand stood before him; the judgment was set and the books
were opened" ([Dan. vii. 10](../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010).md). For the
Almighty sits and judges the ministering angels, and after the judgment
they bathe in that river of fire and are renewed. Afterwards the river
flows on and carries with it fiery coals, and falls on the heads of the
sinners in Hell, as it is said: "Behold the tempest of the Lord, even
His fury is gone forth, yea, a whirling tempest; it shall burst on the
head of the wicked" ([Jer. xxiii.
19](../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#019).md).<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="II:6">6</span>. I saw further the angel *Galitzur*,
surnamed also *Raziel*, who stands behind the curtain and listens to all
that is decreed in heaven and proclaims it. This proclamation is then
handed over to the prophet Elijah and he proclaims it to the world from
the Mount Horeb.

   <span id="II:7">7</span>. The wings of *Galitzur* are spread and keep
off the breath of the holy Creatures, for otherwise all the ministering
angels would be burned by the breath of the holy Creatures.

   <span id="II:8">8</span>. I saw further *Michael*, the great prince,
standing at the right side of the throne, and *Gabriel* at the left; and
*Iefefiyah*, the guardian of the law, standing before it; and
*Metatron*, the angel of the presence, standing at the door of the
palace of God. And he sits and judges all the heavenly hosts before his
master. And God pronounces judgment and he executes it.

   <span id="II:9">9</span>. I saw then a troop of the terrible angels
who surround the throne of glory, they were more powerful and mightier
than all the other angels. All these whom I saw wished to scorch me with
the breath of their mouths, but out of dread of the presence of the
Almighty, the king of kings, they had no power to injure me, for they
all were full of fear and agony and dread before Him.

   <span id="III:1">1</span>. R. Joshua, son of Levi, was a pious man.
When the time approached that he should leave this world, the Lord said
to the angel of death, "Go and fulfil whatever his wish may be." He went
to him and said unto him: "The time is nigh when thou shalt leave this
world, but now tell me what thou wishest, that I may fulfil
it."<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="III:2">2</span>. As soon as R. Joshua heard this, be said:
"I pray thee, show me my place in Paradise." He answered and said: "Come
and I will show thee it." R. Joshua answered and said, "Give me thy
sword, so that thou shouldst not frighten me." And he gave him his
sword. So they went together till they reached the wall of Paradise.
There being outside the wall, the angel of death lifted R. Joshua from
the ground and placed him upon the crest of the wall, and said unto him:
"Behold thy place in Paradise."

   <span id="III:3">3</span>. At that moment R. Joshua jumped down from
the wall and fell into Paradise. The angel of death caught him by his
mantle and said to him, "Get thee out thence." But R. Joshua swore by
the name of God that he would not do so. The angel of death had no power
to enter therein. The ministering angels seeing this, said to the
Almighty: "Lord of the Universe, behold what R. Joshua hath done! By
force hath he taken possession of his portion in Paradise." God
answered: "Go and see if he has ever broken his oath, then shall this
oath of his be likewise void and null." They searched and could not find
any such case. So they came and said: "He hath never broken his oaths in
his

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Cf. Test. Abraham, ch. 9.\]

<span id="page_592">p. 592</span> lifetime." And God answered: "If it be
so, let him remain there."

   <span id="III:4">4</span>. When the angel of death saw this, he said
to R. Joshua: "Give me now my sword back." But R. Joshua did not fulfil
his request till a voice came forth and said: "Give him the knife, for
it is of necessity for His creatures."

   <span id="III:5">5</span>. R. Joshua then said to him: "Swear unto me
that thou wilt not show it any more to the creatures at the moment when
thou takest their souls." \[For up to that time the angel of death used
to kill men openly, as one slaughters animals, and he showed it even to
the suckling in the bosom of their mother.\] At that hour he swore unto
him, and R. Joshua returned the knife to him.

   <span id="III:6">6</span>. After that began the prophet Elijah to
proclaim and to cry out aloud to the just: "Clear the way for the son of
Levi."

   <span id="III:7">7</span>. \[He went and saw R. Joshua sitting in the
compartment of the just, and he asked him: "Art thou the son of Levi?"
And he answered: "Yes." He asked again: "Hast thou seen a rainbow in thy
lifetime?" Again R. Joshua answered: "Yes." And he replied: "Then if
this is so, thou art not the son of Levi."--In fact it had not been the
case. Now as Joshua had not seen a rainbow, but he did not wish to boast
of it and to ascribe it to his own merits. He had asked him about the
rainbow, for it is the sign of the covenant between God and the world;
and when the rainbow appears then God (remembers) and pitieth his
creatures; but when there liveth a just man, there is no longer any
necessity for a rainbow, as through his merits the world is saved. As it
is said: "And the just is the foundation of the world" ([Prov. x.
25](../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#025).md). Therefore did he ask him about the
rainbow.\]

   <span id="III:8">8</span>. The angel of death went to R. Gamaliel and
told him: "So and so hath R. Joshua done unto me." R. G. answered and
said: "He served thee right. But now please go and tell him I request
him to search through heaven and hell their mysteries and to write them
down and send it to me \[also if there are idolators in hell\]."

<span id="page_593">p. 593</span>

   <span id="III:9">9</span>. The angel went, and R. Joshua answered: "I
will do so."

   <span id="III:10">10</span>. Thereupon R. Joshua went and searched
through Paradise and he found therein seven compartments,<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> each of twelve myriads of miles in
width, and twelve myriads of miles in length; the measure of their width
being the same as that of their length.

   <span id="III:11">11</span>. The first compartment corresponds to the
first door of Paradise. Here dwell the proselytes who had embraced
Judaism of their own free will, not from compulsion. The walls are of
glass and the wainscoting of cedar. As I tried to measure it the
inhabitants rose to prevent me from doing it. Obadiah the just, who
presides over them, rebuked them and said: "What are your merits that
this man should dwell here with you?" (for they wished to retain him
there). Thereupon they allowed him to measure it.

   <span id="III:12">12</span>. The second compartment corresponds to
the facing of the door of Paradise. It is built of silver and the
wainscoting thereof of cedar. Here dwell those who repent, and Manasseh,
son of Ezekiah, presides over them.

   <span id="III:13">13</span>. The third compartment, facing the third
door, is built of silver and gold. Here dwell Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
and all the Israelites who came out of Egypt, and the whole generation
who had lived in the desert, and all the kings (princes), with the
exception of Absalom. There is also David, and Solomon, and Kilab, son
of David, still alive, and all the kings of the house of Judah, with the
exception of Manasseh, who presides over those who repent. Over these
here preside Moses and Aaron. Here are the precious vessels of silver
and gold, and jewels, and canopies, and beds, and thrones, and lamps of
gold, and precious stones and pearls. And I asked: "For whom are all
these prepared?" And David answered and said: "They are for those who
still dwell in the world whence thou comest." And I asked:

<span id="page_594">p. 594</span> "Is here perhaps one also from the
Gentiles, at least from my brother Esau?" And he answered and said: "No;
because the Almighty gives the reward of every good deed they do in
their lifetime in that world, but after death they go down to Hell;
whilst the sinners in Israel get their punishment in their lifetime in
that world, but after death they obtain the merit of their good deed
here." As it is said: "And he payeth."<sup><span

   <span id="III:14">14</span>. The fourth compartment, facing the
fourth door of Paradise, is beautifully built, like to the first
compartment, but its wainscoting is of olive-wood. Here dwell the
perfect, and faithful, and just men. Why is the wainscoting of
olive-wood? Because their life has been bitter to them as olives.

   <span id="III:15">15</span>. The fifth compartment is of silver, and
gold, and refined gold, and of crystal, and bdellium; and through its
midst flows the river Gihon. The walls are of silver and gold, and a
perfume breathes through it more exquisite than the perfume of Lebanon.
And beds of silver and gold are there prepared, covered with violet and
purple covers, woven by Eve, and mixed with scarlet and made of hair of
goats, woven by angels. Here dwell the Messiah and Elijah in a palanquin
of the wood of Lebanon; the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom
thereof of gold, the seat of it of purple. Herein lieth the Messiah, the
son of David, who is the love of the daughters of Jerusalem, the midst
thereof is love. The prophet Elijah takes the head of the Messiah and
places it in his bosom and says to him: "Be quiet and wait, for the end
draweth nigh." On every Monday and Thursday and Saturday and Holiday the
Patriarchs come to him and the fathers of the Tribes and Moses and Aaron
and David and Solomon and every king of Israel and of the house of
Judah, and they weep with him and comfort him, and say unto him: "Be
quiet and wait and rely upon thy Creator, for the end draweth nigh."
Also Korah and his company and Dathan and Abiram and

\[1. Cf. Othioth de R. Akiba (Jellinek *l.c.* p. 23).\]

<span id="page_595">p. 595</span> Absalom come to him on every
Wednesday, and ask him: "When will the end of our misery come? When wilt
thou reveal thyself?"

   <span id="III:16">16</span>. He answereth them and says: "Go to your
fathers and ask them." And when they hear of their fathers they feel
ashamed and do not ask any further.

   <span id="III:17">17</span>. When I came to the Messiah he asked me:
"What is Israel doing in the world from which thou comest?" And I
answered and said: "Every day they await Thee." He immediately raised
His voice and wept.

   <span id="III:18">18</span>. In the sixth compartment dwell those who
died through performing a pious act.

   <span id="III:19">19</span>. In the seventh compartment dwell those
who died from illnesses caused through the sins of Israel.

   <span id="III:20">20</span>. R. Joshua, son of Levi, tells further:
"I asked the Messiah to allow me to look into Hell, but he did not allow
me, as the righteous should never behold Hell." So I sent to the angel
called *Komm* that he might describe Hell for me. But it was impossible,
for at that moment R. Ismael, the high priest, and R. Simeon, son of
Gamaliel, and ten just men were killed, and the news reached us, so I
could not go with the angel. I went afterwards with the angel *Kipod*
and the light went with me up to the gates of Hell, and the Messiah came
with me, and they were open. The sinners who were there saw the light of
the Messiah, and rejoiced, and said to one another: "This will bring us
out from here."<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="III:21">21</span>. I saw compartments of ten miles length
and of five width, full of pits of fire, and these consume the sinners,
and after their destruction they are again made whole and fall again
into the fire. In that compartment are ten nations from the Gentiles,
and Absalom presides over them. These nations say one to another: "Our
sin is that we have not accepted the Law; but what is your sin?" And the
other answers: "That is also our sin, we are like you." They say then to
Absalom: "Why

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Ev. Nicodem.\]

<span id="page_596">p. 596</span> art thou punished, seeing that thou as
well as thy parents hast accepted the Law?" And he answers them and
says: "Because I did not hearken to the commandments of my father."
Angels stand close by and with their staves drive them back into the
fire and burn them. Then they hurry to Absalom to beat him also, and to
burn him; but a voice calls out to them: "Do not beat him and do not
burn him, for he is from the seed of Israel, who said 'We will do and
hearken,' and he is the son of my servant David." So they leave him upon
his seat and honour him with the honour of a king. They bring out
afterwards the sinners from the fire just as if they had not been burnt
and the fire had never touched them; and they burn them again. This they
repeat seven times, three times at day and four times at night. Absalom
alone is saved because he is the son of David.

   <span id="III:22">22</span>. After having seen this I returned to
Paradise, wrote description of Hell and sent it to R. Gamaliel and the
ten elders of the Jews, and I told them all what I had seen in Paradise
and Hell.

 

<span id="IV">IV</span>. THE REVELATION OF R. JOSHUA BEN LEVI. (B.)

*Paradise*.

> Mussar, Constantinople, 720, ch. 25, f. 80-81<sup><span
> class="small">a</span></sup>.)

   <span id="IV:1">1</span>. R. Joshua, son of Levi, tells: "Paradise
has two gates of carbuncle, and sixty myriads of ministering angels keep
watch over them. Each of these angels shine with the lustre of the
heavens. When the just man approaches them they divest him of the
clothes in which he had been buried and clothe him with eight clothes,
woven out of clouds of glory, and place upon his head two crowns, one of
precious stones and pearls and the other of gold,<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Cf. Ascensio Isaiae, viii. 14, ix. 9, 24.\]

<span id="page_597">p. 597</span> and they place eight myrtles in his
hand and praise him and say to him: "Go and eat thy bread with joy." And
they lead him to a place full of rivers (waters) surrounded by roses and
myrtles. Each one has a canopy according to his merits, as it is said:
"For over all the glory shall be spread a canopy" ([Is. iv.
5](../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005).md).

   <span id="IV:2">2</span>. And through it flow four rivers, one of
oil, the other of balsam, the third of wine, and the fourth of honey.
Every canopy is overgrown by a vine of gold, and thirty pearls hang down
from it, each of them shining like the morning star. In every canopy
there is a table of precious stones and pearls, and sixty angels stand
at the head of every just man, saying unto him: "Go and eat with joy of
the honey, for thou hast worked assiduously in the Law," of which it is
said: "And it is sweeter than honey," and drink of the wine preserved
from the six days of Creation, for thou hast worked in the Law which is
compared with the wine," as it is said: "I would cause thee to drink of
spiced wine" ([Song viii. 2](../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002).md). The least
fair of them is beautiful as Joseph and Johanan and the grains of the
pomegranate upon which fall the rays of the sun. There is no night, as
it is said: "And the light of the righteous is as the shining light"
([Prov. iv. 18](../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018).md).

   <span id="IV:3">3</span>. And they undergo three transformations
passing through three wards. In the first ward the just is changed into
a child, and he enters the compartment of children and tastes the joys
of childhood. In the second ward he is changed into a youth, there he
enjoys the delights of youth. In the third ward he is changed into an
old man, he enters the compartment of the old and enjoys the pleasures
of mature age.<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="IV:4">4</span>. In Paradise there are eighty myriads of
trees in every corner; the meanest among them choicer than a garden of
spices. In every corner there are sixty myriads of angels singing with
sweet voices, and the tree of life stands in the middle and
over-shadoweth the whole Paradise; and

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Paul, ch. 22, 23, 45; Peter, ch. 5 (H. 19-20).\]

<span id="page_598">p. 598</span> it has 500 tastes, each different from
the others, and the perfumes thereof vary likewise.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> Over it hang seven clouds of glory, and
the winds blow from all the four corners and waft its many odours from
one end of the world to the other. Underneath sit the scholars and
explain the Law. These have each two canopies, one of stars and the
other of sun and moon, and clouds of glory separate one from the other.

   <span id="IV:5">5</span>. Within this is the Eden containing 310
worlds, as it is said: "That I may cause those that love me to inherit
Substance" ([Prov. viii. 21](../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#021).md) \[the
numerical value of the Hebrew word for Substance is equivalent to
310\].<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

   <span id="IV:6">6</span>. Here are the seven compartments of the
just. In the first are the martyrs, as, for instance, R. Akiba and his
companions. In the second, those who were drowned. In the third, R.
Johanan and his disciples. \[In what consisted his great merit? He said:
"If all the skies were skins and all men scribes and all the forests
pens, these scribes would not be able to write down all that I have
learned from my teachers, and still am I no more than a dog liking the
sea."\] The fourth group is of those who were covered by the cloud of
glory. The fifth group is that of the penitents \[for the place occupied
by a penitent not even a perfectly just man can occupy\]. The sixth
group is that of children who have not yet tasted sin in their
lives.<sup><span class="small">\[3\]</span></sup> The seventh group is
that of the poor, who, notwithstanding that, studied the Law and the
Talmud, and had acquired moral life. Of these speaks the verse: "For all
that put their trust in Thee rejoice, and they shout for ever for joy"
(Ps. v. 11 {*sic* [v. 12](../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#012)}.md). And God
Almighty sitteth in their midst, and expounds to them the Law, as it is
said: "Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may
dwell with me" (Ps. xci. 6 {*sic* [cxi.
6](../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#006)}.md). And God hath not yet fully unveiled
the glory which awaiteth them in the world to come, as it is said: "The
eye hath not seen, O God, beside Thee, that which Thou workest for him
that waiteth for Him" (Isaiah lxiv. 4 {*sic* [lxiv.
3b](../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003)}.md). Amen.

> *Jellinek*, Beth-hammidrasch V. 50-51 ( = §§ 10-18).)

   <span id="V:1">1</span>. R. Johanan began his homily with the verse
"Passing through the valley of weeping they make it a valley of
springs." This means to say that the sinner confesses, just as the
leprous confesses, and he says: "I have committed such and such a
transgression in that place, on that day, in the presence of so-and-so,
in that society."

   <span id="V:2">2</span>. Hell has three gates: one at the sea, the
other in the wilderness, and the third in the inhabited part of the
world. That at the sea is alluded to in Jonah ([ii.
3](../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#003).md): "Out of the belly of Sheol cried I,
and thou heardest my voice." That of the wilderness is alluded to
([Numbers xvi. 33](../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#033).md). "So they and all that
appertained to them, went down alive unto Sheol." And that in the
inhabited portion of the world ([Isaiah xxxi.
9](../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009).md) "Saith the Lord, whose fire is in Zion
and his furnace in Jerusalem."

   <span id="V:3">3</span>. Nine different kind of fires are in Hell,
one devours and absorbs, another absorbs and does not devour, while
another again neither devours nor absorbs. There is further fire
devouring fire. There are coals big as mountains and coals big as hills,
and coals huge like unto the Dead Sea and coals like huge stones.

   <span id="V:4">4</span>. There are rivers of pitch and sulphur
flowing and fuming and seething.

   <span id="V:5">5</span>. The punishment of the sinner is thus: The
angels of destruction throw him to the flame of hell; this opens its
mouth wide and swallows him \[as it is said: "Therefore Sheol hath
enlarged her desire and opened her <span id="page_600">p. 600</span>
mouth without measure and their glory and their multitude and their pomp
and he that rejoices among them descends into it" ([Isaiah v.
14.](../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014).md)\] This all happens to him who has
not done one single pious act which would make the balance incline
towards mercy; whilst that man who possesses many virtues and good
actions and learning and who has suffered much he is saved from hell
\[as it is said: "Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff
shall comfort me" ([Ps. xxiii. 4](../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004).md). "Thy
rod" means the suffering and "thy staff" means the law<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>\].

   <span id="V:6">6</span>. R. Johanan began: "The eyes of the wicked
shall fail and refuge is perished from them and their hope shall be the
giving up of the ghost" (Job ii. 20 {*sic* [xi.
20](../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#020)}.md). That means: a body which is never
destroyed and whose soul enters a fire which is never extinguished; of
these speaks the verse: "For their worm shall not die neither shall
their fire be quenched" ([Isaiah lxvi.
24](../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024).md).

   <span id="V:7">7</span>. R. Joshua, son of Levi, said: Once upon a
time I was walking on my way when I met the prophet Elijah. He said to
me: "Would you like to be brought to the gate of hell?" I answered:
"Yes!" So he showed me men hanging by their hair; and he said to him,
these were they that let their hair grow to adorn themselves for sin.
Others were hanging by their eyes; these were they that followed their
eyes to sin, and did not place God before their face. Others were
hanging by their noses; these were they that perfumed themselves to sin.
Others were hanging by their tongues; these were they that had
slandered. Others were hanging by their hands; these were they that had
stolen and robbed. Others were hanging by their sexual organs; these
were they that had committed adultery. Others were hanging by their
feet; these were they that had run to sin. He showed me women hanging by
their breasts; these were they that uncovered their breasts before men,

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Cf. Test. Abraham, ch. 12-14.\]

<span id="page_601">p. 601</span> to make them sin. He showed me further
men that were fed on fiery coals; these were they that blasphemed.
Others were forced to eat bitter gall; these were they that ate on
fast-days. He showed me further men eating fine sand, they are forced to
eat it and their teeth are broken; and the Almighty says to them: "O ye
sinners! when you used to eat that which you stole and robbed it was
sweet in your mouth now you are not able to eat even this." \[As it is
said: "Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked" ([Ps. iii.
8](../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008).md).\] And he showed me men wallowing in
the mire and worms were set upon them; these are they of whom it is
said: "For their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be
quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh" ([Is. lxvi.
24](../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024).md). He showed me further men who are
thrown from fire to snow and from snow to fire; these were they that
abused the poor who came to them for assistance; therefore are they thus
punished \[as it is said: "Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads;
we went through fire and through water" ([Ps. lxvi.
12](../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012).md)\]. He showed me others who were
driven from mountain to mountain, as a shepherd leads the flock from one
mountain to another. \[Of these speaks the verse: "They are appointed as
a flock for Sheol. Death shall be their shepherd and the upright shall
have the dominion over them in the morning, and their form shall be for
Sheol to consume that there be no habitation for it" ([Ps. xlix.
15](../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015).md).\]<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="V:8">8</span>. R. Johanan said: "For every sin there is an
angel appointed to obtain the expiation thereof; one comes first and
obtains his expiation, then follows another and so on until all the sins
are expiated, as with a debtor who has many creditors and they come
before the king and claim their debts, and the king delivers him to them
and says: "Take him and divide him between yourself." So also is the
soul delivered in hell to cruel angels, and they divide it among
themselves.

\[1. [I. 34-49](#I:34.md).\]

<span id="page_602">p. 602</span>

   <span id="V:9">9</span>. Three descend to hell for ever and do not
ascend any more--the man who commits adultery, who blames his neighbour
in public, and who is guilty of perjury. Others say: "Those who honour
themselves by slandering their neighbours, those who make intrigues
between man and wife in order to create disputes among them."

   <span id="V:10">10</span>. Seven descend to Hell: the judge, the
butcher, the scribe, the physician, the barber and the teacher of very
young children. These, if they have fulfilled their mission
conscientiously for the sake of heaven, ascend afterwards again. Three,
however, descend never to ascend: the man who blames his neighbour in
public, the man who slanders his neighbour, and the man who commits
adultery.

   <span id="V:11">11</span>. Hell has seven names: Sheol, Abadon, Beer
Shaon, Beer Shahat, Hatzar Maveth, Beer Tahtiyah, and Tit
Hayaven.<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> The length of Sheol
is a three years' journey, and so are its width and height. Similarly
are the others also. Hell is thus a 2100 years' journey. If a man
deserves punishment he is handed over to the angels of destruction.
These seize him and lead him to the court of death, darkness and gloom,
\[as it is said: "Let their way be dark and slippery" ([Ps. xxxv.
6](../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#006).md)\]. But this is not all, for they
thrust him into Hell, \[as it is said: "And the angel of the Lord
pursuing them" ([Ps. xxxv. 6](../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#006).md)\].

   <span id="V:12">12</span>. When a man dies and is carried along upon
his bier ministering angels walk before him and people walk behind the
bier following him. If they say: "Happy the man, for he was good and
praiseworthy in his lifetime;" the angels say unto him: "Write it down,"
and he writes it down.<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> And
this is not all, but two angels watch over the man at the moment of his
death, and they know whether he has stolen or robbed during his
lifetime; for even the stones and the beams of his house witness against
him; \[as it is said: "For the stones shall cry out of the wall and the
beam out of the timber shall answer it" ([Habak. ii.
11](../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#011).md)\].<sup><span

<span id="page_603">p. 603</span>

   <span id="V:13">13</span>. When a man dies he is brought before
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They say unto him: "My son! what hast thou
done in that world from which thou comest?" When he answereth: "I have
bought fields and vineyards; and I have tilled them all my life." They
answer: "O fool, that thou hast been! Hast thou not learned the words of
King David, who said: 'The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof'
([Ps. xxiv. 1](../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001).md)." Angels then take him
away and bring another man before them, and they ask him in likewise. If
he answereth: "I gathered gold and silver," they retort: "Fool that thou
art! Hast thou not read in the books of the prophets: "The silver is
mine and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts" ([Haggai ii.
8](../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#008).md).

   <span id="V:14">14</span>. When scholars are brought before them,
they say: "My son! What hast thou done in the world from which thou
comest?" He answers: "I have devoted my life to the study of the law."
And the patriarchs answer: "He entereth into peace; they rest in their
beds, each one that walketh in his uprightness" ([Is. lvii.
2](../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002).md). And the Almighty receives them with
grace.

   <span id="V:15">15</span>. There are five kinds of punishment in
Hell, and Isaiah saw them all. He entered the first compartment and saw
there two men carrying pails full of water on their shoulders, and they
pour that water into a pit which, however, never fills. Isaiah said to
God: "O thou who unveilest all that is hidden, unveil to me the secret
of this!" And the Spirit of the Lord answered: "These are the men who
coveted the property of their neighbours, and thus is their
punishment."<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="V:16">16</span>. He entered the second compartment and he
saw two men hanging by their tongues, and he said: "O thou, who
unveilest the hidden, reveal to me the secret of this!" He answered:
"These are the men who slandered, therefore they are thus
punished!"<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

   <span id="V:17">17</span>. He entered the third compartment and he
saw there

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Cf [I. 36](#I:36.md).

2\. I. [38](#I:38), [41](#I:41.md).\]

<span id="page_604">p. 604</span> men hanging by the sexual organs. He
said: "O thou who unveilest the hidden, reveal to me the secret of
this!" And He answered: "These are the men who neglected their own wives
and committed adultery with the daughters of Israel!"<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="V:18">18</span>. He entered the fourth compartment and saw
there women hanging by their breasts, and he said: "O thou who unveilest
the hidden, reveal to me the secret of these!" And He answered: "These
are the women who uncover their hair and rend their veil, and sit in the
open market place to suckle their children in order to attract the gaze
of men and to make them sin; therefore they are punished
thus!"<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

   <span id="V:19">19</span>. He entered the fifth compartment and found
it full of smoke. There were all the princes, chiefs, and great men, and
Pharaoh, the wicked, presides over them and watches at the gate of hell,
and he saith unto them: "Why did you not learn from me when I was in
Egypt?" So he sits there still and watches at the gates of hell.

   <span id="V:20">20</span>. On the eve of the Sabbath the sinners are
led to two mountains of snow, where they are left until the end of the
Sabbath, when they are taken back from there and brought again to their
former places. An angel comes and thrusts them back to their former
place in hell.<sup><span class="small">\[3\]</span></sup> Some of them
take, however, snow and hide it in their secret parts to cool them
during the six days of the week, but the Almighty says unto them: "Woe
unto you who steal even in hell!" \[As it is said: "Draught and heat
consume the snow waters, in Sheol they sin." {[Job xxiv.
19](../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#019.md)} That means to say: "They sin even in
Sheol."\]

   <span id="V:21">21</span>. Every twelvemonth the sinners are burned
to ashes and the wind disperses them and carries those ashes under the
feet of the just \[as it is said: "And ye shall tread down the wicked,
for they shall be ashes under the sole of your feet" (Malachi iii. 29
{*sic* [iii. 21](../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#021)}.md)\].

<span id="page_605">p. 605</span>

   <span id="V:22">22</span>. Afterwards the soul is returned to them
and they come out black as the blackness of a pot, and they acknowledge
the justice of their punishment and say: "Thou hast rightly sentenced us
and rightly judged us. With Thee is righteousness and with us shame, as
it is with us to-day."<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   <span id="V:23">23</span>. The other nations, however, and the
idolators are punished in the seven compartments of hell, in each
compartment for a twelvemonth. And the river Dinor floweth from beneath
the throne of glory and falleth over the heads of the sinners, and it
floweth from one end of the world to the other.<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

   <span id="V:24">24</span>. There are seven compartments in hell, and
in each of them are 6000 rooms, in each room 6000 windows, in each
window (recess) there are 6000 vessels filled with venom, all destined
for slanderous writers and iniquitous judges. \[It is to that, that
Solomon alludes when he says: "And thou mourn at thy latter end when thy

Me and the souls which I have made" ([Is. lvii.

he is a descendant from those who said: "We will do and hearken"

   <span id="VII:1">1</span>. We read in the Baraita of the Creation:
"Beneath the earth is the (abyss) *Tehom* under Tehom is *Bohu*, under
Bohu is *Yam*, under Yam is *Mayim*, under Mayim is *Arka*, and there
is, Sheol, Abadon, Beer Shahat, Tit-hayaven, Shaare Mavet, Shaare
Tzalmavet, and Gehinom. Here are the sinners and the angels of
destruction presiding over them. There is darkness thick as the wall of
a city, and there the heavy and bitter punishments of the sinners are
enacted, as it is said: 'The wicked shall be put to silence in darkness'
([1 Sam. ii. 9](../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#009).md)."

   <span id="VII:2">2</span>. The uppermost compartment is *Sheol*. The
height thereof is 300 years' journey; the width 300 years' journey; and
its length 300 years' journey. The second compartment is *Beer Shahat*,
of the same height, width, and length. The third is *Tit-Hayaven* of
equal size. The fourth is *Shaare Mavet* of the same size. The fifth
*Abadon* of the same size. The sixth *Shaare Tzalmavet* of the same
size. The seventh *Gehinom* of the same size. That makes altogether the
length of hell 6300 years' journey."<sup><span

one-sixtieth of the fire of Shaare Tzalmavet, and so of every
consecutive compartment till the fire of Sheol, and in Sheol is half

therein when they come out from the fire are tortured by the hail (ice),
and when they come out from the hail (ice) the fire burns them, and the
angels who preside over them keep their souls within their bodies \[as
it is said, "for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be
quenched" ([Isaiah lxvi. 24](../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024).md)\].

   <span id="VII:3">3</span>. We read further, "God created seven hells,
in each hell are seven compartments, in each compartment there are seven
rivers of fire and seven of hail (ice), the width of each is 100 cubits,
its depth 1000 cubits, and its length 300 cubits, and they flow one
after the other, and all the sinners pass through them and are burned,
but the 40,000 angels of destruction who preside over them revive them
and raise them on their feet and announce to them their deeds which were
evil, and their ways which were crooked," and they say to them, "Pass
now through the rivers of fire and hail and snow, just as you passed
over and transgressed the law and the commandments which were given unto
you on Mount Sinai, for you feared not the fire of hell and the
punishment of Abadon. Now render account of your deeds!"

   <span id="VII:4">4</span>. There are besides in every compartment
7000 holes (crevices), in every hole there are 7000 scorpions. Every
scorpion has 300 slits (cavities), in every slit 70,000 pouches of
venom, from these flow six rivers of deadly poison. When a man touches
it he immediately bursts, every limb is torn from him, his body is cleft
asunder, and he falls dead upon his face. The angels of destruction
collect his limbs and set them, and revive the man and place him upon
his feet and take their revenge upon him anew.<sup><span

   R. Ismael tells: "Sagansagel addressed me and said to me: 'My
beloved! sit in my bosom and I will tell thee what will happen to
Israel.' So I sat in his bosom and he looked at me and wept; and tears
flowed from his eyes and dropped on my face. And I said: 'Glorious
heavenly light! Why dost thou weep? ' And he answered: 'Come and I will
show unto thee what is awaiting my holy people Israel.' He took me and
brought me into the innermost place, to the treasure-house of treasures
and he took down the books and showed me the decrees of many misfortunes
written therein. I asked him: 'For whom are these destined?' And he
answered: 'For Israel!' Again I asked: 'Will they be able to endure
them?' And he answered: 'Come to-morrow and I will show thee more
calamities still.' The next day he showed me still more calamities, for
some it being decreed to die by the sword, for others to die of hunger,
others again destined for slavery. And I said: 'O glorious heavenly
light! have they indeed sinned so heavily?' He anwered: 'Every day new
calamities are decreed, but when Israel gathers in his prayer-house and
repeats: "May His exalted name be praised" we retain those calamities
and do not let them come out from these rooms.' When I left him I heard
a voice speaking in Aramaic and saying: 'The holy temple is destined to
be ruined and the temple to be a burning light, and the kingly palace
delivered over to the owls and the young to slavery, and the princes to
death and the pure altar to be profaned, and the table for the shewbread
will be carried off by enemies, and Jerusalem will be a desert, and the
land of Israel a desolation.' When I heard these <span id="page_610">p.
610</span> words I was terrified and trembled and I fell down. Then came
the angel Hadarniel and breathed into me a new soul and lifted me upon
my feet and said to me: 'My beloved! what hath happened unto thee?' And
I answered: 'O glorious heavenly light! is there indeed no salvation for
Israel?' And he answered and said: 'Come and I will show thee the
treasures of comfort and help stored up for Israel.' He brought me up
and I saw groups of angels weaving raiments of salvation and making
crowns of life and fixing in them precious stones and pearls, and
anointing them with all kinds of spices and delights.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> I asked: 'For whom are these all
destined?' He answered: 'For David, king of Israel.' And I said: 'Show
me the glory of David.' And he said: 'Wait three hours until David will
come hither in his glory.' So he took me and placed me in his bosom, and
he asked me: 'What dost thou see?' I answered: 'I see seven lightnings
running into one another.' He said: 'Shut thine eyes that thou mayest
not be dazzled by the light which precedes King David.' At that moment
the wheels and Ophanim and holy Creatures and the treasures of rain and
snow, and the clouds of glory and the planets and the ministering angels
moved and shook and said: 'The heavens declare the glory of God' (Ps.
xix. 1 {*sic* [xix. 2](../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#002)}.md). I heard then a
loud voice proceeding from Eden crying: 'The Lord reigneth for ever and
ever,' and lo! David was in front and all the kings of his house after
him, each one with his crown upon his head; but the crown of David
surpassed them all, its lustre shineth from one end of the world unto
the other. And David went up to the heavenly Temple, where a throne of
fire stood ready for him, whose height is of 40 parasangs, its length
and its width double the same. When David took his seat upon the throne
prepared for him, facing that of his Creator, all the kings of Judah
ranged themselves before him, and the kings of Israel stood behind him.
Then he

<span class="small"></span>

<span id="page_611">p. 611</span> began to utter hymns and praises, such
as no human ear has heard.<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>
And when he said: 'The Lord will reign for ever and ever.' Metraton and
his company responded: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts,' and the
holy Creatures praised and said: 'Blessed be the glory of the Lord in
its place.' The heavens say: 'The Lord will reign for ever and ever.'
The earth says: 'The Lord hath reigned, does reign, and will reign for
ever,' and all the kings respond and say: 'And the Lord will be king
over the whole earth.'"
