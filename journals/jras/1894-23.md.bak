ART. XXIII.--*The Ra.t.thapâla Sutta*. By WALTER LUPTON, I.C.S.

THE Sutta of which the Pâli text, together with a translation, is here
given is No. 82 of the Majjhima Nikâya. I have availed myself througbout
of Buddhaghosa's Commentary, the *Papañca-Sûdanî*; but only so much of
it is here reproduced, in the form of extracts, as I thought was
necessary either to support a rendering, or to illustrate a point, of
the text. Such extracts are marked 'Pap. Sûd.' I have added, at the end
of the text, a few further references of general interest.

   In its form the Ra.t.thapâla Sutta stands midway between those Suttas
(the vast majority) in which the chief interlocutor is the Buddha
himself, and those Suttas in which this place is held by one of hie
disciples. Of this latter class, the Madhura Sutta on Caste, which
appeared in the April number of this *Journal*, is an example. The
present Sutta differs from this in that the Buddha does indeed figure,
as in the first class of Suttas; but his appearance is rather an episode
than the essential part, and the story of the conversion of the young
nobleman is really an introduction to the main part of the Sutta, from
which the Buddha disappears. The main interest rather lies in the
attitude of contemporary opinion towards the demands made by the
Buddha's teaching, and in bringing out the feeling, not confined,
perhaps, to the days of Gotama, of surprise, not unmingled with pity, of
the average man in the world, and of the world, towards earnest spirits
prepared to give up everything which the world regards as making life
worth living, to pursue an ideal, to tread the higher path. The bulk of
mankind is content with a lower standard. "It is possible," says his
father to Ra.t.thapâla, "both to enjoy the <span id="page_770">p.
770</span> good things of life, and to perform good works." What need of
such rigid system of self-denial? asks the world. "Come, Ra.t.thapâla,"
echoes his father; "give up this Discipline, return to family life," or,
as the Pâli words actually translate, 'take the lower course.' Finally,
King Koravya takes up the parable, and presents the case for the world
in four questions. Briefly summarised, the position is this: One can
understand, perhaps, a man who is old, or diseased, or impoverished, or
desolate, renouncing the world; one can understand, that is, a man who
is no longer able to enjoy the things of life, and who is out of heart
generally with the world, making a show of giving up this mundane
existence for higher things. But here is a young man in the heyday of
youth, with rank and position, with health and wealth; and it is such an
one who is renouncing all and everything to become a 'shaveling
ascetic.' This is the wonder. Sour grapes, the world can understand; but
this other thing--the hands of surprise are upraised thereat.

   Apart from this general interest, it cannot be said that the student
of Buddhism, as such, will find anything remarkable in this Sutta. But
it may be of interest to note that the story which is the framework of
the Sutta was certainly a popular one with the Buddhist community; for
we find it again in the Vinaya, Sutta Vibha"nga, Pârâjika, 1. 5
(Oldenberg's edition, vol. iii. p. xi.), and in the Jâtaka (Fausböll,
vol. i. p. 156, the Vâtamiga-Jâtaka); while the story of Ra.t.thapâla is
referred to again, by way of illustration, in the Sutta Vibha"nga
(Oldenberg, vol. iii. p. 148; Sa"mghâdisesa, vi. 4-6). In the first
case, substituting Sudinna for Ra.t.thapâla, the story is repeated
almost verbatim, for the first three-fourths. The last fourth of the
story is different, in that Sudinna yields to the entreaties of mother
and wife, and becomes the pattern backslider, as Ra.t.thapâla remains
the instance of steadfast resolution. The Jâtaka tale, on the other
hand, if more pointed, is <span id="page_771">p. 771</span> meagre and
somewhat far removed from our version. Still there is enough, in Jâtaka
phraseology, 'to establish the identity' of the two, and to see how in
the Jâtaka the story was clipped and altered to suit its present
purpose. Suffice it to say here that it is the slave-girl who, with the
mother's consent, sets herself to break down the resolution of the young
Prince Tissa, the Jâtaka Ra.t.thapâla, or rather Sudinna, for Tissa is
secluced from the Way of Holiness, and relapses with Sudinna into the
laity.

   It would be an interesting question to ask, in connection with the
date of the various portions of the Tipi.taka"m, which of the three
versions, if any, is the primordial story, or whether some story of the
kind was generally current in the early centuries of Buddhism. If it be
permitted to hazard a theory based on a close comparison of the two
stories, I should consider that Sudinna was evolved as the correlative
of Ra.t.thapâla, in order to illustrate certain precepts of the Vinaya
Nikâya. For the latter is admittedly a composite work, pieced together
at different periods. But in the present state of our knowledge of the
age of the texts, we are limited to speculation; and it is perhaps idle
to attempt to argue the question one way or the other.

*Majjhima*, No. 82.

RA.T.THAPÂLA SUTTA.

   Thus have I heard:--Once the Blessed One, as he wandered from place
to place in the Kuru country, with a great company of Brethren, arrived
at the town of the Kurus, named Thullako.t.thita. Now tidings came to
the Brahmins and householders of Thullako.t.thita that the sage Gotama,
of the Sakya clan and tribe, having renounced the world, and wandering
from place to place in the Kuru country with a great company of
Brethren, was arrived at Thullako.t.thita; and that regarding the
Blessed One, Gotama, such was the high repute noised abroad that it was
said of him that he was a Blessed One, an Arahat, a very Buddha,
excellent in wisdom and conduct, an auspicious one, who has surveyed all
existence, an incomparable breaker-in of restive humanity, a teacher of
gods and men, a blessed Buddha; that he, having brought himself to the
knowledge thereof, and realised it face to face, tells of this world of
existence, with its Devas, its Mâra, and its Brahmâ, and of the beings
therein, Samanas and Brahmins, and the rest of mankind with the beings
they have deified; he preaches a Doctrine, fair at beginning, fair at
end, fair throughout, text and interpretation; he makes known a way of
Holiness supremely beautiful; it was good to go and see such Arahats as
he was.

   So the Brahmins and householders of Thullako.t.thita went to the
place where the Blessed One was; and when they had come thither; some of
them sat down respectfully beside him; some, on the other hand,
exchanged friendly greetings with the Blessed One; and when they had
exchanged with him the greetings of friendliness and civility, then sat
down beside him. Others sat down by him, making humble obeisance with
palms upraised in reverential attitude towards the Blessed One; and some
made mention of their name and house, and so sat down with some who kept
silence. And when the Brahmins <span id="page_791">p. 791</span> and
householders of Thullako.t.thita were thus seated beside him, the
Blessed One instructed them with a discourse of the Doctrine, and caused
them to receive it, and stirred them up, and brought them to extol it.
Now at that time there was sitting in that congregation a young man of
noble birth, Ra.t.thapâla by name, a son of the chief family in this
very Thullako.t.thita. Now the young man Ra.t.thapâla thought thus: "So
far as the Blessed One expounds the Doctrine point by point, it is no
easy matter for one who lives the ordinary lay life of the householder
to go the Way of Holiness, most perfect, most pure as the polished
shell. Wherefore were it better for me, cutting off my hair and beard,
and putting on yellow robes, to relinquish the household life and go
forth unto homelessness."

   Then, when the Brahmins and householders of Thullako.t.thita had been
instructed by the Blessed One by his discourse of the Doctrine, and had
received it in their minds and been stirred up to acknowledge and extol
it; and, having rejoiced in the words of the Blessed One and given him
thanks and risen from their seats, and, having said a respectful
farewell, had taken their departure, keeping him ever on the right--then
the young man Ra.t.thapâla, while the Brahmins and householders were not
yet gone far off, approached the Blessed One, and sat respectfully
beside him. And when he was thus seated, the young man, Ra.t.thapâla.
spake as follows to the Blessed One: "As far, Lord, as I understand the
Doctrine set forth by the Blessed One, point by point, it is no easy
matter for one who leads the household life, to go the Way of Holiness,
most perfect, most pure as the polished shell. I would, Lord, obtain
admission to the ascetic life from the Blessed One; yea, I would obtain
full admission into the order."

   "Have you then; Ra.t.thapâla, your parents' consent to your going
forth from home to houselessness?"

   "I have not, Lord, their consent to my going forth from home to
homelessness."

<span id="page_792">p. 792</span>

   "Then, Ra.t.thapâla, the Tathâgatas receive not him into the homeless
life who has not his parents' consent."

   "Then, Lord, so will I do that my parents will allow me to go forth
from home to homelessness." And the young man, Ra.t.thapâla, rising up
from his seat, greeted respectfully the Blessed One; and passing from
him, keeping him ever on the right, came to the place where his mother
and father were, and being come, spake thus to them: "My dear parents,
so far as I understand the Doctrine set forth by the Blessed one, point
by point, it is no easy matter for one who leads the household life, to
go the Way of Holiness, most perfect, most pure as the polished shell. I
wish, then, having cut off my hair and beard, and donned yellow robes,
to give up this life of home, and go forth to the homeless state. Do ye
allow me so to go forth!"

   When he had said this, the parents of the young man Ra.t.thapâla
spake to him thus:--"My dear Ra.t.thapâla, you are our only son, dear to
us and beloved, well cared for, delicately nurtured. You have never,
dear Ra.t.thapâla, known any sorrow. Come, Ra.t.thapâla, eat and drink,
and associate with your companions; and eating and drinking and
associating with your companions, and enjoying the pleasures of life,
and doing good works, remain content therewith. We do not allow you to
give up home and go forth a homeless one. We shall be unwilling to be
separated from you even by death. Shall we, then, allow the living to
give up home and go forth unto homelessness?"

   A second time also, and a third, the young man Ra.t.thapâla spake to
his parents; and a second time, and a third also, they returned him
answer in the same words. Then the young man, Ra.t.thapâla, obtaining
not from his parents their consent to his renunciation, flung himself
then and there even on the bare ground, saying, "Here, here, death shall
come to me, if I go not forth a homeless one." And his parents said to
him: "Dear Ra.t.thapâla, you are our only son, dear to us and beloved
(etc. as above). We cannot let you go forth from home to homelessness."
<span id="page_793">p. 793</span> So they spake, but Ra.t.thapâla
remained silent. And they spake to him a second time, and a third time;
and ever at each entreaty, Ra.t.thapâla lay there, answering naught.

   Then the parents of the young man Ra.t.thapâla went to his friends;
and when they had come, they spake thus to them;--"Good sirs, this
Ra.t.thapâla of ours is lying on the bare ground and saying, 'Here even
shall death come upon me, or I go forth a homeless one.' Come, good
sirs, go to Ra.t.thapâla, and say to him, 'Friend Ra.t.thapâla, you are
your parents' only son, dear to them and beloved, well cared for and
delicately nurtured. You have never, Ra.t.thapâla, known sorrow. Get up,
friend Ra.t.thapâla, eat and drink, and associate with your companions;
and eating and drinking, and associating with your companions, and
taking the pleasures of life, and doing good works, remain content
therewith. Your mother and father cannot see their son go forth from
home to homelessness. They will be unwilling to give you up even to
death when it comes at its appointed time. Shall they then, while you
are yet alive, allow you to go forth from home to homelessness?'"

   So the friends of the young man Ra.t.thapâla, hearkening to his
parents, approached the place where Ra.t.thapâla was; and when they had
come to him, they spake as they had promised. Thus they spake, but
Ra.t.thapâla remained silent; and a second time, and a third, they spake
to him; and ever Ra.t.thapâla lay there, answering naught.

   Then the friends of the young man Ra.t.thapâla came to where his
mother and father were, and said to them;--"Good parents, your son
Ra.t.thapâla is lying on the bare ground, and saying, 'Here even shall
death come upon me, or I go forth a homeless one.' If ye consent not to
his going forth to the life of homelessness, there, even on that very
spot, will he meet his death. But if ye consent, ye will indeed see him
gone forth unto homelessness; yet if he shall not find contentment in
his homeless life, <span id="page_794">p. 794</span> what other course
will there be for him? 'Twill be here, and here alone, that he will turn
back. Allow him, then, to go forth from home unto homelessness."

   "We allow him, then, to go forth; but when he has become a homeless
ascetic, he must from time to time come to see his parents."

   Then his friends went to the place where Ra.t.thapâla lay, and said
to him, "Friend Ra.t.thapâla, you are your parents' only son, dear to
them and beloved, well cared for and delicately nurtured; you have
never, friend Ra.t.thapâla, known any sorrow; get up \[and eat and drink
and associate with your companions, and eating and drinking and enjoying
ease, and taking the pleasures of life, and doing good works, remain
content therewith\]; you have your parents' consent to go forth from
your home unto homelessness; but when you are gone forth, you must come
from time to time to see them."

   Then Ra.t.thapâla rose up and, having fortified himself with food,
went to where the Blessed One was. And when he had come thither, and
greeted him respectfully, he sat dawn beside him, and when he was thus
seated, Ra.t.thapâla spoke to the Blessed One:--"My parents have
consented, Lord, that I should go forth from home to homelessness. Let
the Blessed One receive me." Accordingly the young man, Ra.t.thapâla,
found admission at the hands of the Blessed One, yea, full admission to
the homeless state.

   Now the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla had not been admitted to the full
religious life longer than a fortnight, when the Blessed One, having
sojourned at Thullako.t.thita as was convenient, departed thence for
Sâvatthi; and thither, after the circuit of his wanderings, he at length
arrived. There the Blessed One took up his residence in Jetavana, in the
garden of Anâthapi.n.dika. But the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla, dwelling in
solitude, far removed from the world, diligent and persevering, and
earnest in effort, in no long time attained that for which the young
scions of noble lineage give up home to go forth to homelessnes, <span
id="page_795">p. 795</span> namely the supreme goal of the Way of
Holiness; having brought himself here in this visible world to the
knowledge of it, and realised it face to face, dwelling ever therein.
And he came to full understanding that re-birth was to be no more, that
the Way of Holiness had been traversed, that all that should be done had
been accomplished, and that after this life there would be for him no
beyond. So the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla became yet another among the
Arahats.

   Then the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla came to the place where the Blessed
One was; and when he had come there took his seat respectfully beside
him. And being thas seated, the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla said to the
Blessed One: "Lord; I wish to go and see my mother and father, if the
Blessed One grant me permission." Thereupan the Blessed One pondered in
his mind the thoughts of Ra.t.thapâla; and when he became conscious that
Ra.t.thapâla was not minded to abandon the Discipline and to take to the
lesser path, the lay-life, the Blessed One said to the Venerable
Ra.t.thapâla: "At your pleasure, Ra.t.thapâla; go whenever you think
fit."

   So Ra.t.thapâla arose from his seat, and taking respectful farewell
passed from the Blessed One, keeping him ever on the right. And, having
arranaged his dwelling-place, and taking his robes and bowl, he departed
thence for Thullako.t.thita; whither in the course of his wanderings he
at length arrived, and took up his residence there in a pleasaunce
called Deer Park, belonging to King Koravya. Then in the morning the
Venerable Ra.t.thapâla, putting on his yellow robes and taking his bowl,
entered Thullako.t.thita for alms; and as he went from house to house in
succession on his round for alms, he came to the place where his father
dwelt. Now at this time his father was in the central hall of his house,
being tended by his barber. Glancing up, he saw the Venerable
Ra.t.thapâla coming in the distance. And seeing him he said, "These
shaveling ascetics caused our only son, our dear and <span
id="page_796">p. 796</span> beloved boy; to give up his home for
homelessness." And so the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla received no gift at his
father's house, nor even courteous refusal, but abuse alone.

   Now at that moment a slave girl belonging to the relatives of the
Venerable Ra.t.thapâla was about to throw away some gruel which had
turned sour from being kept overnight. So the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla
said to her: "Sister, if you are going to throw away that sour gruel,
put it here into my bowl." Now, as she put this sour old gruel into the
bowl of the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla, she recognised his hands and his
feet, and the sound of his voice. Thereupon she went to the place where
his mother was, and said to her: "If you please, ma'am, do you know, my
young master, Ra.t.thapâla, is come back." "Oh! If you but speak the
truth," the mother replied, "you shall obtain your freedom." And then,
going to his father, she said to him: "Do you know, husband, they say
our son Ra.t.thapâla is returned."

   In the meantime, the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla was eating his sour gruel
under a wall close by, when his father came to him and said: "Is it so
then, my dear Ra.t.thapâla, will you eat sour old gruel? Nay, dear
Ra.t.thapâla, must you not come to your own house?"

   "Where, householder," he answered, "is our house who have given up
home to go forth unto homelessness. We went, homeless one, to your
house, householder; but there we obtained no alms, not even courteous
refusal, but only abuse."

   "Come, dear Ra.t.thapâla, we will go home."

   "Nay, householder, the need of a meal is at an end to-day."

   "Then consent, dear Ra.t.thapâla, to take your meal with me
to-morrow."

   The Venerable Ra.t.thapâla by his silence consented; and his father,
perceiving his consent, returned to his own house. And when he had
returned, he caused a great heap of treasure and gold to be made, and
caused it to be covered with mats. Then he summoned the wives of <span
id="page_797">p. 797</span> the mundane life of the Venerable
Ra.t.thapâla, and said to them: "Come here, my daughters, trick
yourselves out; in all the brave adornments in which ye were formerly so
dear and winning to the young man Ra.t.thapâla." And in the course of
that night his father caused drinks and meats and delicacies to be
prepared in his house; and went and informed the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla
when it was the time. "It is the time, dear Ra.t.thapâla," he said; "the
food is ready." Then in the morning the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla, clothed
in his robes, took his bowl and went to his father's house; and sat down
on the seat prepared for him.

   Then his father, causing the heap of treasure and gold to be
uncovered, said to the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla: "This, dear Ra.t.thapâla,
is your maternal wealth, that your paternal wealth, and that other the
wealth of your father's fathers. It is possible both to enjoy the good
things of life, dear Ra.t.thapâla, and to perform good works. Come, dear
Ra.t.thapâla, give up this Discipline, and return to family life, enjoy
your wealth, and perform good works."

   "If, householder, you would carry out my words, you would have this
heap of treasure and gold put on to carts and conveyed to the Ganges,
and there plunged into the middle of the stream; for therefrom will
arise to you, householder, sorrow, and wailing, and grief, and woe, and
despair."

   Then they who had been the wives of his mundane life came to the
Venerable Ra.t.thapâla, and each of them, taking hold of his feet, said
to him, "Who and what, pray, dear lord, are the goddesses for whose sake
you go now the Way of Holiness?"

   "Nay, sisters, 'tis for the sake of no goddesses that I now tread the
Way of Holiness."

   "Our lord Ra.t.thapâla addresses us by the name of sisters," they
exclaimed; and they fell, swooning away, to the ground.

   Then the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla said to his father, "If, householder,
food is to be given, then do ye give it; but do not harass me
therewith."

<span id="page_798">p. 798</span>

   "Eat, my son; the food is ready," said his father, and with his own
hands he caused him to take his fill of drinks and meats and delicacies,
pressing him with more until he refused. Then the Venerable
Ra.t.thapâla, having eaten and withdrawn his hand from the bowl,
standing up and not sitting, recited these stanzas:--

"Behold this tricked-out frame, this maimed, corrupt,  
And propped-up body, that doth yet so much  
Usurp the thoughts of men, abiding not!

Behold this tricked-out form, bejewelled, ringed,  
Set up with bones and skin; how to the view  
Its garish raiment makes it bright and fair!

Fair feet, red tinged with dye, and fragrant mouth  
That odorous powders had the savouring of;--  
Such folly is enough for folly's friends,  
But not for him who seeks the Shore beyond.

Fair locks in eight-fold curls, eyes fringed with black;--  
Such folly is enough for folly's friends,  
But not for him who seeks the Shore beyond.

Yea, tinged with black, fresh painted and adorned,  
This fatal mass of foul mortality;--  
Such folly is enough for folly's friends,  
But not for him who seeks the Shore beyond.

The keeper set his snare, but as the deer  
Not even touched the net; so we depart,  
Our need of food fulfilled, unfettered, free;  
But they who set the snare, they weep and wail."

   And having recited these stanzas, standing ever, then the Venerable
Ra.t.thapâla went to the deer-park of King Koravya. And when he had come
thither, he sat down at the root of a tree to pass the heat of the day.
Now King Koravya called his park-keeper and said to him: "Keeper, clear
out the Migacîra park; we are going to visit it." "Certainly, your
Majesty," answered the keeper, and as he was clearing the park he saw
the <span id="page_799">p. 799</span> Venerable Ra.t.thapâla sitting
under a tree. And having seen him, he went to the place where King
Koravya was, and said, "Your Majesty, the park is cleared; and there is
there the young sir, Ra.t.thapâla, the son of the chief family in
Thullako.t.tita, whom you have frequently extolled. He is sitting at the
foot of a tree to pass the heat of the day." "Then, keeper, let the park
be for to-day; we will go and wait on that worshipful Ra.t.thapâla." So
saying, King Koravya, having given orders for them to remove the food
which had been prepared for him, and having caused his chariots so fair,
so fair, to be made ready, got into his chariot so fair, and passed
forth from Thullako.t.thita with his chariots so fair, so fair, in royal
pomp to see the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla, and having gone in his chariot
as far as a chariot might go, he alighted from it, and made his way on
foot with a brilliant train to the place where the Venerable
Ra.t.thapâla was. And when he had come there, be exchanged with the
Venerable Ra.t.thapâla the greetings and compliments of friendliness and
civility, and remaining standing beside him, he said to him: "Let the
Venerable Ra.t.thapâla sit himself here on a couch of flowers."

   "Nay, great King, sit you there. I will remain on my own seat."

   So King Koravya sat down on the seat prepared for him; and when he
was thus seated, he spake thus to the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla: "These,
Ra.t.thapâla, are the four losses, overtaken by which in this world some
persons cut off their hair and beard, and putting on yellow robes give
up home to go forth unto homelessness. What are the four? They are, the
loss from old age, the loss from sickness, the loss of wealth, and the
loss of relatives. And what, Ra.t.thapâla, is the loss from old age? ln
this world, Ra.t.thapâla, a person becomes worn, and old, and aged,
<span id="page_800">p. 800</span> burdened with many years, nearing the
term of his life. Then he falls a-thinking to himself: 'I am now worn
and old and aged, and burdened with the weight of years, my term of life
nearly done. I cannot now acquire the wealth I have not acquired, nor
keep that which I have acquired. It were better then for me, cutting off
my hair and beard, and putting on yellow robes, to go forth unto
homelessness.' So he, overtaken by the loss from old age, cutting off
his hair and beard, and clothed in yellow robes, goes forth from his
home unto homelessness. This, Ra.t.thapâla, is called the loss from old
age. Ra.t.thapâla, however, is still young and vigorous, still but a
youth, with hair that age has not yet whitened; still in the fair bloom
of youth, in the prime of his days. This loss from old age has not come
to Ra.t.thapâla. What has Ra.t.thapâla known, or seen, or heard, that he
has gone forth, forsaking his home, unto homelessness?

   "And what, Ra.t.thapâla, is the loss from sickness? On this earth,
Ra.t.thapâla, a person becomes ill, racked with pain, exceedingly sick,
and he falls a-thinking to himself: 'Here I am, ill, racked with pain,
exceedingly ill; I cannot acquire the wealth that I have not acquired,
or increase that which I have acquired; it were better, therefore, for
me to cut off my hair and beard, and, putting on yellow robes, to give
up all and go forth to homelessness.' So he, overtaken by the loss from
sickness, having cut off his hair and beard, and put on yellow robes,
gives up all, and goes forth unto homelessness. This, Ra.t.thapâla, is
called loss from sickness. But Ra.t.thapâla is still in good health,
free from pain, with a healthy digestion, troubled by no excess of
either hot or cold. Ra.t.thapâla has not suffered from loss by sickness.
What has Ra.t.thapâla known, or seen, or heard, that he has gone forth
from home unto homelessness?

   "And what, Ra.t.thapâla, is loss of wealth? On this earth,
Ra.t.thapâla, a certain one is wealthy, of great riches, having much
substance; by degrees this substance of his goes to destruction. He
falls a-thinking to <span id="page_801">p. 801</span> himself: 'Formerly
I was wealthy, of great riches, having much substance; by degrees my
substance has gone to destruction. I cannot acquire wealth that I have
not acquired, nor can I increase the wealth that I have. It were
therefore better for me, cutting off my hair and beard, and donning
yellow robes, to give up all and go forth to homelessness.' So he,
overtaken by loss of property, cuts off his hair and beard, and, putting
on the yellow robes, goes forth to homelessness. This, Ra.t.thapâla, is
called loss of wealth. But Ra.t.thapâla is the son of the chief family
in this very Thûlako.t.thitam. He has not suffered from loss of wealth.
What has Ra.t.thapâla known, or seen, or heard, that he has given up
home to go forth unto homelessness?

   "And what, Ra.t.thapâla, is loss of relatives? On this earth,
Ra.t.thapâla, a certain one has many friends and blood relations; by
degrees these friends and relatives fall away; and he falls a-thinking
to himself: 'Formerly I had many friends and blood relations; these by
degrees have fallen away; I cannot now acquire the wealth I have not
acquired, nor can I increase that which I have. Therefore it were better
for me to cut off my hair and beard, and, putting on yellow robes, to go
forth from home to homelessness.' So he, overtaken by loss of relatives,
cuts off his hair and beard, and, putting on the yellow robes, goes
forth. This, Ra.t.thapâla, is called loss of relatives. But Ra.t.thapâla
has, in this very town, many friends and relatives; he has not,
therefore, suffered from loss of relatives. What, then, has Ra.t.thapâla
known, or seen, or heard, that he has gone forth from home to
homelessness?

   These indeed, Ra.t.thapâla, are the four kinds of losses which cause
some men to cut off their hair and beard, and, putting on yellow robes,
to go forth from home to homelessness. These Ra.t.thapâla has not
suffered. What then has Ra.t.thapâla known or seen or heard that he is
gone forth?"

   "There are four Doctrines, great King, declared by the <span
id="page_802">p. 802</span> Blessed One, the All-Knowing and Seeing, the
Arahat, the Very Buddha; which I, having known, and seen, and heard,
have gone forth from home to homelessness. What are the four? 'The world
passes away; it has no permanence.' This, great King, is the first
doctrine declared by that Blessed One, the All-Knowing and Seeing, the
Arahat, the Very Buddha; which I, having known, and seen, and heard,
have gone forth unto homelessness.

   "'The world is without a refuge, without protection.' This is the
second doctrine declared by that Blessed One, the All-Knowing and
Seeing, the Arahat, the Very Buddha; which I, having known, and seen,
and heard, have gone forth unto homelessness.

   "'The world has naught of its own, but, forsaking all, must pass
away.' This is the third doctrine of the Blessed One (etc.), which I,
having known, and seen, and heard, have gone forth into homelessness.

   "'The world is ever wanting more, unsated, the slave of desire.'
This, great King, is the fourth doctrine of the Blessed One (etc.),
which I, having known, and seen, and heard, have gone forth from home to
homelessness.

   "These indeed, great King, are the four Doctrines declared by that
Blessed One, the All-Knowing and Seeing, the Arahat, the Very Buddha;
and these I, having known, and seen, and heard, have passed forth from
home to homelessness."

   "You have said, Ra.t.thapâla, 'that the world passes away; it has not
permanence.' But how, Ra.t.thapâla, is this statement to be understood?"

   "What think you, great King? Were you at twenty or twenty-five
skilled in the management of elephants and horses and chariots, expert
in the use or the bow and sword, firm of foot and strong of arm, at home
in the fight?"

   "At twenty or twenty-five, Ra.t.thapâla, I was skilled in the
management of elephants and horses and chariots, expert in the use of
bow and sword, firm of foot and strong of arm, at home in the fight.
Why, at one <span id="page_803">p. 803</span> time, Ra.t.thapâla, my
strength was more than human; I saw no equal of myself in strength."

   "Then what think you, great King? Are you now thus firm of foot and
strong of arm, unassailable in the fight?"

   "Not so, Ra.t.thapâla, I am now worn and old and aged, burdened with
length of years, my days well-nigh run. My age is eighty; sometimes,
Ra.t.thapâla, I go to place my foot in one place, and put it down in
another."

   "Concerning this, then, great King, was it said by that Blessed One,
the All-Knowing and Seeing, the Arahat, the Very Buddha, that the world
passes away, and has no permanence,' which I, having known, and seen,
and heard, have gone forth to homelessness."

   "Marvellous, Ra.t.thapâla, wonderful! how well this indeed has been
said by that Blessed One (etc.) that the things of the world pass away
and have no permanence. For they do pass away, Ra.t.thapâla, and have no
permanence. But in this royal house, Ra.t.thapâla, there are bodies of
elephants, and of horses, and of chariots, and of infantry; and these
would be a good protection against our necessity. But you said,
Ra.t.thapâla, that the things of the world are without refuge, without
protection. How then, Ra.t.thapâla, is this statement to be understood?"

   "What think you, great King, of this? Have you any habitual
complaint?"

   "Yes, indeed, Ra.t.thapâla, I have a certain complaint which comes
upon me, So that sometimes my friends and relatives stand round me and
say, 'King Koravya must now fulfil his time! King Koravya will die.'"

   "What think you, then, great King? Can you say to these friends and
relatives, 'Come, friends and relatives, all of you, good people, divide
this suffering with me, that so my own share of pain may be lightened.'
Or must you bear this suffering alone?"

   "No, Ra.t.thapâla, I cannot say to these friends and relatives what
you have suggested; but I have to bear my suffering alone."

<span id="page_804">p. 804</span>

   "Concerning this, then, was it spoken by that Blessed One (etc.),
that the things of the world are without a refuge, without protection;
which I, having known, and seen, and heard, have gone forth unto
homelessness."

   "Marvellous, Ra.t.thapâla, wonderful! how well was it said by the
Blessed one that the things of the world are without a refuge, without
protection. For they are, indeed, without a refuge, without protection.
But, Ra.t.thapâla, in this royal house is there abundant stock of
treasure and gold stored up both in vault and in attic. But you,
Ra.t.thapâla, said that the world has naught of its own, but, giving up
all, must pass away. Yet how is this statement, Ra.t.thapâla, to be
understood?"

   "What think you, great King, of this? The pleasures of your five
senses which you now possess and enjoy, and by which you are surrounded
in this life, will you possess and enjoy, and be surrounded by, these
very same pleasures hereafter also? Or will others enter upon this
wealth, while you go to fare according to your deserts?"

   "The pleasures, Ra.t.thapâla, which I possess and enjoy and am
surrounded by in this life, I cannot, shall not, possess and enjoy, and
be surrounded by these very same pleasures hereafter also. Then, indeed,
others will enter upon this wealth, and I shall go to fare according to
my deserts."

   "Concerning this, then, great King, was it said by that Blessed One
(etc.) that the world has naught of its own, but, leaving all, must pass
away; which I, having known, and seen, and heard, have gone forth to
homelessness."

   "Marvellous, Ra.t.thapâla, wonderful! How well said by that Blessed
One (etc.) that the world has naught of its own, but, leaving all, must
pass away. But Ra.t.thapâla said that the world is ever wanting more,
unsated, the slave of desire. Yet how, Ra.t.thapâla, must this be
understood?"

   "What think you of this, great King? Is this Kuru country in which
you dwell prosperous?"

   "Even so, Ra.t.thapâla, this Kuru country, in which I dwell, is
prosperous."

   "Then what think you, great King? If a servant <span id="page_805">p.
805</span> of yours should come from the East country, a man trustworthy
and faithful; and when he had come, should say to you, 'If you please,
great King, know that I am come from the East country: there saw I a
mighty province, prosperous and rich, populous, thickspread with
inhabitants. There are there vast numbers of elephants, and horses, and
chariots, and infantry; there, too, is rouch ivory and skins; there much
gold and coins, unwrought and wrought; there, too, multitudes of women.
And it may be won by such and such a number of your servants. Conquer
it, great King.' Pray, would you do it?"

   "Yes, Ra.t.thapâla, I would conquer it and dwell there."

   "What think you, great King? If your servants should come from the
west country and from the north also, and from the south, having
travelled across seas, faithful and trustworthy men; and if they were to
tell you the same story (as above), and each should say, 'Conquer this
land, great King': pray, would you do it?"

   "I would indeed conquer it, Ra.t.thapâla, and dwell there."

   "Concerning this, then, great King, was it said by that Blessed One,
the All-Knowing and Seeing, the Arahat, the Very Buddha, that the world
is ever wanting more, unsated, the slave of desire; which I, having
perceived, and seen, and heard, have gone forth from home unto
homelessness."

   "Marvellous, Ra.t.thapâla, wonderful! How well was it said by that
Blessed One (etc.) that the world is ever wanting more, unsated, and the
slave of desire."

   Thus spake the Venerable Ra.t.thapâla; and, having thus spoken, he
said this further: "I see rich men in the world; they acquire wealth but
bestow it not, from infatuation. Greedy, they hoard their riches, and in
their desire long ever after more.

   "A king, having conquered the world with violence, up to the limits
of the ocean, occupying it all on this side of the sea, unsatisfied
still, would desire, too, the parts beyond.

   "Kings, and many others of the earth, approach death with desires
unquenched; still unsated, they leave the body: in the world there is no
standing still in desire.

<span id="page_806">p. 806</span>

   "Their relatives bewail him with dishevelled hair; and say 'Alas,
verily he is dead!' They wrap him in a cloth and bear him away; and
taking him to the pile, they burn him.

   "So he, forsaking his wealth, pierced with stakes, is burnt in a
single cloth. To the dying, neither relatives nor friends are a refuge
here.

   "The heirs take away his wealth; its owner goes to fare according to
his deserts. The dead man wealth follows not, nor sons, nor wife, nor
property, nor land.

   "By wealth a man gains not length of years; nor by possessions
escapes the decay of age. Short is this life, say the wise, and
unenduring, full of change.

   "Rich and poor alike are touched by this stroke; the fool even with
the wise is touched. But the fool, thus stricken, that moment in his
folly succumbs; the wise man is touched but is unmoved.

   "Therefore wisdom is better than riches: 'tis by this that a man
attains Arahatship, the end of existence. For they in whom folly hath
not ceased, go on from birth to birth performing sinful acts.

   "Man enters the womb and goes to a new existence, being born and
re-born continually; believing such a one, the man of little wit again
enters the womb and again is born to existence.

   "As the wicked thief, taken in house-breaking, is punished in
consequence of his own act, even so mankind; the wicked man is punished
hereafter in another world in consequence of his own act.

   "The pleasures of sense, varied, and sweet, and heart-delighting,
stir up the mind in changing modes. Seeing the evils of the pleasures of
sense, therefore I went forth, O King, unto homelessness.

   "As fruit from the tree, so at the dissolution of the body fall the
boy, and the youth, and the aged. Seeing this, O King, went I forth from
home unto homelessness. Most excellent is the recluse's certain way."
