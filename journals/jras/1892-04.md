ART. IV.--*Bhûridatta Jâtaka Vatthu*. By R. F. ST. ANDREW ST. JOHN, M.A.

PREFATORY REMARKS.

THIS translation has been made from a Burmese copy printed at the
Hanthawati Press, Rangoon, but there is nothing to show whence the text
was taken. I have also made use of a manuscript taken from the Mandalay
Library, and now at the India Office. The gâthâ, which in many places
seem to be imperfect, are not given in the shape of gâthâ in the
Mandalay copy. In some cases the Burmese translation was redundant, and
in others defective, so in translating them, though not a Pâli scholar,
I have done my best to stick to the Pâli text, receiving some valuable
assistance from Prof. Rhys Davids. The Jâtaka is No. 547 in the Ceylon
List, and what is called one of the Greater Jâtaka, probably composed at
a late date, as it refers to the Pa.n.dara Jâtaka, No. 521 \[vol. v. p.
75, of Fausböll\], which I have translated in a note from another
Burmese source.

   The object of this very remarkable Jâtaka is to set forth the general
wickedness of Brahmans and the arguments in their favour given by
Kâ.nâri.t.tha, who in a former birth had been a sacrificial Brahman,
which arguments are refuted at length by the Bodhisat Bhûridatta. There
are two points to which I would draw special attention, which may throw
light on the date or period at which it was composed.

   1st. In the twenty-first stanza of the first discourse (F. 157) there
is a reference to certain practices in the country of Kamboja, which
apparently has no connexion with what goes before.

   2nd. The appellation of the snake-charmer-Alampâyano. A derivative of
this word, viz. Alampay, is now used in Burmese to denote a person who
is skilled in catching snakes (*vide* Judson's Dictionary), and it may
be argued <span id="page_78">p. 78</span> that this word was taken from
the name of this snake-charmer celebrated in Jâtaka-lore. I think,
however, that there is evidence to show that it was not the man's proper
name, but the name of the trade, for I find that the words used by the
snake-charmer himself in relating the story of the Garu.la are,
Alampâya.namantanâma "the charms of a snake-charmer."

   The word, therefore, I take it, has its derivation from Alam implying
*full, sufficient*, and pâya *drinking* or *having drunk*. It may also
be noted that the same word occurs in the Sudhammacari Stories, which I
have given in *Folk Lore Journal*, vol. vii. part iv. p. 311, and that
the Princess Sudhamma-cari is said to have been the daughter of Madda, a
Râjâ of Kamboja.

   It is much to be regretted that books which appear to be published by
the "Text-book Committee of Rangoon " are not more carefully edited.
They are full of errors.

   P.S.--Since the above was written Professor Fausböll has had the very
great kindness to favour me with a copy of his transcript of the Pâli
verses of this Jâtaka. It would have been impossible without his aid, so
graciously given, to restore the right reading of many of them.

 

BHÛRIDATTA JÂTAKA.

<span class="small">(From the Burmese.)</span>

CHAPTER I.   (*Nâgara*.)

   One day, when the most excellent Buddha was residing in the Jêtavana
Monastery, he came into the hall, and, sitting down, looked round at the
Rahans assembled there. Seeing amongst them some laymen who were keeping
the fast-day, he took them as the subject of his discourse, and said, "O
devout laymen, ye do well in keeping the fast; but, inasmuch as ye have
me to give you instruction, you must not think overmuch of your
devoutness, for in past times there have been others who, though they
had no teacher relinquished great wealth in order to keep the fast."

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

   At their request he then related the following birth-story:

   In times long past, when Brâhmadatta reigned in Bârâ.nasi, he
appointed his eldest son to be Uparâjâ; but, seeing that he had
accumulated much wealth and many adherents, he feared that he might
become a source of danger to the throne, and said, "Dear son, I pray you
depart into some other country, until I shall have passed away, when you
can return and assume the royal estate, which is your inheritance." The
Prince, obedient to his father's commands, left his country as a
solitary wanderer, and took up his abode in a hut in a valley near the
river Yamunâ, where he assumed the garb of an ascetic, living on the
fruits which he found in the forest. At that time a certain Nâga
lady,<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> who had lost her
husband, came up from Nâga land, and, seeing the Prince's footprints on
the river shore, followed them till she came to the hut. The Prince
being absent, in search of fruit, she entered, and, seeing his couch of
dead leaves and other utensils, reasoned thus with herself: "This hut
belongs to a hermit: I will try him in order to find out whether he be a
real ascetic, or only some person who is pretending to be one. If he be
a real ascetic he will have no carnal desires and refuse to sleep on a
couch that is adorned. If, however, he does recline on it, he will not
be a real hermit, and will be willing to become my husband and dwell
with me in this forest." She then went down to Nâga land, and, bringing
thence some fairy flowers, spread them on the couch and withdrew.

   In the cool of the evening the Prince came back to his hut, and,
seeing the flowers, exclaimed, "Who on earth can have done this?" He
then made his supper and fell asleep upon the bed with sensations of
delight. In the morning he got up, and, having swept out his cell, went
again in search of fruits. When he was gone, the Nagini came again, and,
seeing that the flowers were faded and crushed, said, "Evidently this is
no hermit, but a man of ordinary passions." She then removed the old
flowers and strewed the <span class="small"></span>

\[1. The Pâli is matapatikâ nâgamâ.navikâ.\]

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span> couch with fresh ones. The second night
the Prince was again very much astonished, but slept on the couch. In
the morning he went out and concealed himself in the bushes near his hut
to watch, and, on seeing the lovely Nagini, carne out full of love for
her, and asked her who she was. The lady replied, "My lord, I am a
Nagini, and my husband is dead. Whence come you, my lord?" The Prince
told her that he was the son of the Râjâ of Bârâ.nasi, and proposed that
they should dwell together. The Nagini at once agreed, and caused a
splendid fairy palace to spring up, in which they dwelt with all manner
of delights. In due course the Nagini bore a son, whom they named
Sâgara, because he was born near the sea; and when he was able to run,
she had a daughter, whom they called Samuddajâ for the same reason.

   Not many years after this a hunter of Bârâ.nasi came that way, and,
recognizing the Prince, told him all that was going on. He told the
Prince he would tell the Râjâ all about him, but, on reaching Bârâ.nasi,
found that the Râjâ was dead. On the seventh day after his decease the
funeral took place, and then the nobles consulted, saying, "Sirs, a
country that is kingless cannot ward off the thorns of strife, and as we
know not where our Prince is, we are powerless. We had better make ready
the consecrated car<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> and send
it forth in search of a king." Whilst they were thus deliberating, the
hunter returned and reported his discovery. As soon as the nobles heard
the news, they rewarded the hunter, and proceeded with a great retinue
as the hunter directed them. On reaching the Prince's dwelling, they
told the Prince that he must return with them and take up the reins of
government. Upon this the Prince went to his wife and said, "Lady, my
father has departed this life for that of the Devas, and the nobles have
come to ask me to assume the royal estate: let us both go and reign in
Bârâ.nasi, which is twelve yojana in extent; you, my queen, will be the
chief of 16,000 ladies." But

<span class="small">\[1. Consecrated chariot (phussaratho), in which
have been placed the four great elements (mahâbhûtâ), viz. earth, air,
fire, water.\]</span>

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span> she answered, "My lord Râjâ, I cannot,
for I am endowed with a poison (or flame) which shows itself on the
slightest feeling of irritation, and though I feel strongly that I ought
to live with my husband, yet if I were to accompany him and anything
were to arouse my anger, those who were the cause would be reduced to
fine ashes: for this reason I cannot go with you." Next morning she
entreated him as follows: "My dear lord, since I cannot accompany you,
and these children of ours, though Nâgas, are still to a certain extent
human, be kind to them, if you really love me. Being of a race that
lives in the waters, they are very tender, and cannot bear the rays of
the sun; cause therefore, I pray you, that they make vessels to hold
water, in which they may be conveyed, and when they arrive at Bârâ.nasi
have a tank made for them to sport in." Having thus spoken, she passed
round him by the right hand and, after saluting him and embracing both
the children, departed weeping to serpent-land.

   So the Râjâ, heavy at heart and with brimming eyes, went forth from
their palace to where the nobles were waiting for him, and when they had
poured over him the water of consecration, he directed them to prepare
the vessels in which to carry his children. When the vessels had been
prepared, he directed that they should be placed on wheels and filled
with water. In course of time they got to Bârâ.nasi, which was decorated
for the occasion, and remained for seven days in a great pavilion
surrounded by singers and dancers, whilst the nobles drank sweet
liquors.<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> The Râjâ then
ordered a lotus tank<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> to be
made for the children to play in.

   One day, when they were letting the water into the tank, a tortoise
got in by accident, and being unable to get out concealed himself there.
When the Prince and Princess were swimming about, one day, it put its
head above the water and looked at them. The children, seeing the
tortoise, fled in terror to their father, and told him there was a

\[1. Mâhâpanam, great enjoyment, or big drink.

2\. Pokkhara.nî.\]

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span> demon in the tank. The King summoned his
attendants, and ordered that the tortoise should be caught. When it was
found and brought, and the children declared that it was the demon that
had frightened them, he ordered that it should be punished.

   One nobleman suggested that it ought to be pounded in a mortar,
another said that it ought to be boiled and eaten, another that it
should be roasted; but one noble who was afraid of water, suggested that
it should be thrown into a whirlpool in the river Yamunâ. On hearing
this, the tortoise put out its head and said, "O Râjâ, what have I done?
It would be a terrible punishment to throw me into a whirlpool, and I am
ready to undergo any punishment rather than that."

   The King, being very angry, at once ordered that the tortoise should
be thrown into the whirlpool, and when the sentence had been executed,
the tortoise was sucked down by the current to serpent-land.

   Just then a son of Dhatara.t.tha, the Nâga king, was sporting in the
whirlpool, and seeing the tortoise, ordered it to be seized; whereupon
the tortoise, who saw himself in a worse plight, cried out, "Friends,
why do you, who are the servants of Dhatara.t.tha, treat me so roughly?
I am an ambassador<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> from the
Râjâ of Bârâ.nasi, named Cittacû.la, and he has sent me to inform your
lord Dhatara.t.tha that he wishes to give him his daughter in marriage.
Take me before your Râjâ." When the Nâga youths heard this, they took
him before the Râjâ. But the Râjâ was displeased and said, "The Râjâ of
Bârâ.nasi ought not to have sent such an ugly fellow as this as his
ambassador."

   The tortoise called out, "O Râjâ of the Nâgas, why do you say this?
Ought an ambassador to be as tall as a palm tree?<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> Ambassadors, whether they be tall or
short, are estimated after the manner in which they perform their
duties. O Râjâ, my master the King of Bârâ.nasi has many ambassadors: on
land he employs men, and in the air

\[1. Dûto, an emissary.

2\. Tâlo, Corypha.\]

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span> birds; I am Cittacû.la the tortoise, no
common tortoise, but a nobleman and bosom friend of the Râjâ; do not
revile me."

   Then the King of the Nâgas inquired on what business he had been
sent, and the tortoise answered, "My lord, our master has made friends
with all the kings who are on the face of the earth, but has not yet
made an alliance with Dhatara.t.tha, the King of the Nâgas; he is,
however, willing to give you his daughter Samuddajâ in marriage, and
ordered me to come to your majesty and inform you. Do not delay, O Râjâ,
but send some messengers with me to arrange the day for the wedding."

   Dhatara.t.tha, being pleased at this speech, summoned some of the
Nâga youths, and directed them to go to Bârâ.nasi and arrange the
wedding. So they went with the tortoise; but just before they got to
Bârâ.nasi, the tortoise, seeing a pool of water handy, slipped into it
and hid himself under pretence of gathering lilies as a present. After
waiting some time for the tortoise, they went on, and taking human form
went into the presence of the Râjâ.

   The King asked them why they had come and they answered, "Your
Majesty, we have been sent by Dhatara.t.tha, the King of the Nâgas, and
we trust that your Majesty is in good health." The Râjâ then asked them
what special business they had been sent on, and they said:

   Let all by thee be acquired; thy daughter give to the Râjâ."</td>

   On the King hearing this, he was enraged, and answered:

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

   Hearing this, the Nâga youths thought, "Of a truth this Râjâ belongs
not to a race that is suitable to match with our King Dhatara.t.tha, and
yet he sent his ambassador Cittacû.la to say he would give his daughter:
we must display our power, and frighten this King of Bârâ.nasi, who has
insulted our Râjâ." So they said:

   On hearing this, the young Nâgas were very wroth and said, "Though we
could now slay the King of Bârâ.nasi, with the breath of our nostrils,
since we are under our master's order to arrange a marriage and not
commit destruction, it will not be right for us to do so; so we will go
and report the matter to our Lord." They therefore returned to
serpent-land, and on arrival there the Serpent King questioned them,
saying, "Dear sirs, how is it? Have you brought the Princess Samuddajâ?"
The enraged messengers answered, "O Râjâ, you sent us to the King of
Bârâ.nasi without knowing the truth of the matter; if you are angry and
desire to slay us, do it here in serpent-land. The Râjâ of Bârâ.nasi was
puffed up with pride and reviled thee." Thereupon the Serpent King
cried:

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

   Thus they spread themselves all over the city of Bârâ.nasi in the
houses, the streets, and water-tanks, at midnight.

   And the four young Nâgas who had acted as ambassadors, twining their
bodies round the legs of the couch on which the King was sleeping,
spread out their hoods and showed their fangs and hissed loud enough to
split his head. Dhatara.t.tha the Nâga King, too, overshadowed the whole
city. Those who woke up in the night and stretched out their hands or
feet felt nothing but hissing serpents, and shrieked out "Alas! the
serpents, the serpents." Some struck lights, and looking out saw the
serpents writhing and twining themselves all over the gates and
battlements and with one voice shrieked and wailed. So the whole city
was in confusion, and when the day dawned, all the people, from the King
downwards, were in a state of terror and cried out, "O great Lord of the
Nâgas, why do you thus torment us?" The serpents answered, "Your king
sent an ambassador to our king promising his daughter in marriage, and
afterwards treated our ambassadors with contumely, acting deceitfully
and treating our king as though he were nought but a brute beast; verily
if your king gives not his daughter to our king, we will destroy this
city and all its inhabitants."

   On hearing this, the people answered, "O great Nâgas, be not afraid,
but open a road for us to go to the palace and we will entreat our
king." So the Nâgas allowed them to pass, and the people assembled at
the door of the palace and wept with a great lamentation. The Queen,
too, with all the ladies of the palace, cried out, "O Râjâ, give your
daughter Samuddajâ to the King of the Nâgas." The four young Nâgas round
the King's couch cried out, "Give, give!"<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   So the King of Bârâ.nasi was stricken with terror and shrieked out
thrice, "I will give my daughter Samuddajâ to Dhatara.t.tha the king of
the Nâgas."

   When he had uttered these words, all the Nâgas retired

<span class="small">\[1. This is the rough translation of verses 10 to
13.\]</span>

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span> to a distance of three leagues from
Bârâ.nasi and dwelt in a city which they had built for the purpose; they
also sent suitable presents for the Princess. The Râjâ of Bârâ.nasi
received the presents and informed the messengers that he would send his
daughter in due state. He then sent for Samuddajâ and taking her to an
upper chamber in a turret of the palace, opened the window, and said,
"My darling daughter, look at that beautiful city. I am going to give
you in marriage to the Râjâ of that city, where you will be a queen. It
is not far from here, and when you call to mind your parents, it will be
easy to return and see them." Having thus spoken persuasively, he caused
her to wash her head, and when she had been decked in jewels and rich
garments, he sent her in a carriage<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> with a retinue of nobles. The nobles of
the Nâgas also came out to meet her with great honour. They then entered
the Nâga city and presented her to the King, who sent them back to
Bârâ.nasi with rich presents. The King of the Nâgas placed the Princess
in a splendid palace on a magnificent couch surrounded by Nâga damsels
in human form, where she soon fell into a deep sleep.

   Then Dhatara.t.tha, accompanied by all his hosts, departed thence to
serpent-land, and when the Princess woke up and saw all the Nâga palaces
and gardens, which were like those in the land of the Devas, she
inquired of her attendants; saying, "This country is very splendid and
not like my own native land, whose country is it?" and they answered
"Lady, it is the city of your lord and husband, Dhatara.t.tha, the King
of the Nâgas; it is not suitable for those who have not acquired merit.
Since you have acquired merit, you have obtained this fairy
dwelling-place and wealth." King Dhatara.t.tha issued a proclamation to
be made by beat of drum throughout all serpent-land, saying, "Let no one
dare show himself to Queen Samuddajâ in serpent form." So the Princess
dwelt happily with Râjâ Dhatara.t.tha, unaware that she was not in the
country of men.

CHAPTER II. (*Uposatha*.)

   Now in due course Queen Samuddajâ bore a son to Dhatara.t.tha, and as
he was very beautiful, he was called Sudassana. Again, she bore another,
who was named Datta. He was the Bodhisat. After this she bore Subhoga,
and then a fourth, who was called Ari.t.tha. Up to that time Queen
Samuddajâ did not know that she was in serpent-land; but one day some
one said to the little Ari.t.tha, "Your mother is not a Nâga, but a
human being;" so he determined to put her to the test, and one day when
at her breast he changed himself into serpent form and coiled his tail
round his mother's instep. When the Queen saw this, she was terrified,
and, shrieking, struck him to the earth with her hand, and one of her
finger nails happening to injure his eye, he became blind in that eye,
and the blood ran out. Dhatara.t.tha, hearing the Queen cry out, asked
what was the matter, and hearing what Prince Ari.t.tha had done,
threatened to have him slain. But Queen Samuddajâ said, "O Râjâ, one of
his eyes is put out, do not punish him further, be merciful I pray you."
So the Râjâ, out of love for his Queen, pardoned him. From that day
Queen Samuddajâ knew that she was in serpent-land, and her son Ari.t.tha
was called Kâ.nâri.t.tha.<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   Now when the Prince was grown up, their father divided his country
into five parts, and gave them each a division with a proper retinue. He
kept one division for himself. Sudassana, Subhoga and Kâ.nâri.t.tha used
to come once a month to see their father, but Datta came every
fortnight, and if there was any difficult question, he would solve
it.<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> When he went with his
father to Virûpakkha,<sup><span class="small">\[3\]</span></sup> be also
solved any difficult questions that were asked. One day Virûpakkha went
with all the Nâga hosts to Tâvâtimsa to do homage to Sakko, and a
difficult question was mooted. When no one was able to solve it, the
Bodhisat Datta

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span> explained it, at which Sakko was
delighted, and said, "Dear son, Datta, you are as full of wisdom as the
earth is thick, from henceforth you shall be called
Bhûri-datta."<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   From that day he remained in attendance on Sakko.<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> Seeing Sakko in his palace, called
Vejayanta, surrounded by beautiful fairies dressed in goodly apparel and
covered with jewels, he was desirous of becoming a Deva, and thought,
"What advantage is there in being a raw-flesh<sup><span
class="small">\[3\]</span></sup> eating Nâga? I will return to
serpent-land and keep the fast-days." So he returned to serpent-land,
and said, "Dear father and mother, I intend to keep the fast-days." They
answered, "Dear son, do as you wish, but, if you keep them outside
serpent-land, on the surface of the earth, there will be danger." The
Bodhisat answered, "Good, I will keep them in a quiet garden in
serpent-land."

   However, whilst thus engaged, the young Nâga girls surrounded him,
playing on various instruments, and disturbed him; so he said, "I cannot
keep the fast properly here, I will go to the country of men;" but,
fearing that his parents might prevent him, he called his wives and
said, "Ladies, I intend to go to the country of men and coiling myself
round an ant hill at the foot of a banyan tree on the banks of the
Yamunâ, keep a fourfold fast: on the morning of the following day come
with all your retinue and musicians, and conduct me back to
serpent-land." Having thus instructed them, he went and coiled himself
on the top of an ant hill and reflected thus, "If any one desires to
take my skin, my sinews, my bone or my blood, let him do so." Then,
making himself rigid like the log of a harrow, he kept the fast. When
Âru.na sent forth his rays, the Nâga women came as directed and
conducted him back to Nâga-land, and in this manner he fasted many
times.

\[1. Bhûri in Pâli means both *earth* and *wisdom*.

2\. The Burmese form of Sakko is Sikrâ. The Sanskrit form Sakra, adapted
to Burmese by changing a to i, which makes it *thi-kyâ*, i.e. "He who
*knows* and *hears*."

3\. I find the Pâli word is ma.n.duka bhakkhena *frog-eating*. The
mistake has occurred through the similarity of the Burmese words phâ a
*frog*, and thâ *flesh*. So, *green* and *raw* being the same word,
*green-frog* became *raw-flesh.*\]

CHAPTER III. (*Nagarapavesana*.)

   Now at that time there dwelt in a village near the gate of Bârâ.nasi
a Brahman (named Nesâda), who, with his son Somadatta, used to get his
living by killing deer. One day this Brahman, not being able to find
even a lizard, said, "Dear son Somadatta, if we go home empty-handed,
your mother will scold." Just then they came close to the place where
the Bodhisat was fasting and went down to the Yamunâ to drink. On coming
up they saw the track of a deer, so the Brahman said to his son,
"Somadatta, I see the footprints of a deer, stand still for a little and
I will shoot it. Then taking his bow and arrows, he remained on the
watch at the foot of a tree. The deer came down to drink and the Brahman
shot at it, but it made off, leaving traces of its blood. The two
hunters followed it up, and when they found it, the sun was just
setting, and they arrived at the banyan tree where the Bodhisat was
fasting. They agreed that they would go no further that night, and,
having hid away the carcase of the deer, climbed into the tree. In the
morning the Brahman woke up, and just then the Nâga ladies had come to
escort Bhûridatta back to serpent-land. Hearing the sound of their
music, he tried to waken his son Somadatta, but being unable, he let him
sleep and went alone, and going up to the Bodhisat said:<sup><span

   After he had said this, he reflected, "This Brahman is a cruel old
fellow; if he were to point me out to a snake-charmer, I should incur
great danger. I will therefore carry him off to serpent-land and endow
him with great wealth, and so be able to continue my fasts in security."
He therefore said to the Brahman, "Come with me to serpent-land and see
all its delights. I will give you great wealth." The Brahman answered,
"My lord, I am not alone, but my son is up in the tree: if he may come
too, I will go. After saying, "Call your son," the Bodhisat said:

\[1. Yakkho, a superhuman being.

2\. The Burmese MS. supplies bhasmâ bhaveyya *would become ashes*. Tejo
*flame, power*, is also translated poison.\]

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

18\.

   "This profound and ever-boiling pool, so dread, behold (I pray
you),  
   'Tis my supernatural dwelling, deeper than a hundred fathoms."

19\.

   "Peacock and heron rejoicing, dark water in midst of the wood,  
   Yamunâ plunge into without fear, 'tis a realm of bliss and delight."

   He then bore away both father and son to serpent-land, and on
arriving there they changed their human appearance to that of fairies.
The Bodhisat gave them much riches and five hundred fairy wives. So the
two Brahmans enjoyed great wealth and the Bodhisat was able to keep his
fasts. Every half-moon he came to see his father and mother and preach
the law; then he went to the Brahmans, and inquired after their health
and wishes.

   One day the old Brahman, after about a year had passed, felt unhappy,
and wishing to return to the country of men, began to feel as if
serpent-land were hell, and all the beautiful ornamented palaces like
prisons, and the lovely Nâga girls like devils; so he determined to go
and talk to Somadatta. On getting there he said, "Dear son, are you
happy here?" Somadatta replied, "Dear father, why should I not be happy?
are you not happy too?" His father answered, "Dear son, it is long since
I have seen your mother, brothers, and sisters, I am unhappy, let us go
away." At first Somadatta refused; but as his father besought him, he at
last consented. The old Brahman thought, "If I tell Bhûridatta that I am
unhappy, he will

<span class="small">\[1. poriso. lit. *a man*, whose height represents a
fathom.\]</span>

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span> only heap more wealth on me. I must
pretend to praise his wealth and splendour, and ask him why he
relinquishes them to go and fast on earth. If he says that he fasts in
order to go to Deva-land, I will say that we too must go back in order
to get permission from our relatives to become ascetics: if I put it in
this way, he will not be able to refuse, but will give me permission to
return to earth." Shortly after this Bhûridatta came, and the old
Brahman said:

way."<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   The Bodhisat then said: "O Brahman, since you are determined to be an
ascetic, so be it; but if at any time through inability to carry out
your vows, you relinquish that life, come to me, without fear, and I
will give you great wealth."

   "Bhûridatta, Prince of Nigas," said the Brahman, "your words are very
pleasant: in the hour of need I will certainly come to you for help."

   The Bodhisat then summoned some Nâga youths and directed them to
conduct the Brahman and his son back to the country of men; so they took
them close to the city of Bârâ.nasi and left them. The Brahman then said
to his son, "Dear Somadat, this is the spot where I killed the deer, and
here I slew a wild boar;" and thus conversing about the old familiar
haunts, they came to a pool of water, in which they proceeded to bathe;
and as soon as they went into the water, their fairy garments
disappeared, and their old garments came in place of them, and their
bows and arrows. Then Somadatta wept and said, "Father, to what misery
we have returned after so much magnificence!" But the old Brahman
replied, "Son, be not afraid, deer are not scarce in the forest, and we
can still get our livelihood by killing them." Thus conversing they
arrived at their home.

   When Somadatta's mother heard that her husband and son had arrived,
she ran out to meet them, and, bringing them into the house, set food
and drink before them. When he had eaten and drunk, he fell asleep, and
then she said to her son, "Dear Somadat, you and your father have been
absent for a long time, what city have you been residing in?" He said,
"Dearest mother, Bhûridatta, the King of the Serpents, carried us both
off to his country, but, though

<span class="small">\[1. 34, 36, 36, and 37, are not given as gâthâ in
the Burmese version.\]</span>

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span> we enjoyed great wealth and pleasure
there, we were unhappy and have come back." "If that is true," said the
Brahmaness, "have you brought any precious stones with you?" "No," said
Somadat, "we have brought none." "Didn't the Serpent King give you a
single thing?" asked the mother. "He offered my father a ruby ring,
mother, but he would not take it; and I heard him tell the Serpent King
that as soon as he got back to earth, he would turn hermit." "Ah!" said
the Brahmaness, "he has forsaken his wife and family all these long
years, and I have had all the trouble of feeding the household, whilst
he has been enjoying himself, and now he wants to become a hermit!" So
in a furious passion she began to belabour her husband with the stirring
stick, saying, "Heh! Brahman, what do you mean by coming back from
Bhûridatta's country after refusing the wishing ring? You are going to
be a hermit, are you? Very well, get out of my house sharp, will you!"

   The Brahman cried out, "Madam, do not get into such a passion; deer
are not scarce in the forest. I will practise my calling as a hunter,
and support you and your family." He then went off with his son into the
forest.

   Now at that time a Garu.la was perched on the top of a silk cotton
tree in a forest on the shore of the southern ocean, flapping its wings,
by which means it divided the waters and seized a Nâga that was below.
In those days the Garu.las did not know the proper way of seizing a
Nâga, and used to seize them by the head; but afterwards, through the
advice of a hermit, which is related in the Pa.n.dara Jâtaka,<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> they learnt to seize

\[1. The Pa.n.dara Jâtaka is to be found in Jâtaka, vol. v. p. 75, and
the Burmese version from the Ma.niratanapon is attached to this as a
note.

In the country of Bârâ.nasi, when Brahmadat was king, 500 sailors were
wrecked in the sea, and, by the force of the wind, one of them was
carried to Karampira harbour. On account of his emaciated body, people
said, "This ascetic is a person of small requirements," so they kept
him. Thinking that he was now well off, and to keep up his character,
when they offered him garments he declined them. The people, thinking it
was impossihle to find a more abstemious man, had a great regard for him
and built him a cell, and he was known far and wide as the "Naked one of
Karampira" (Karampira acelaka). A prince of the Nâgas and a prince of
the Garu.las used to come and worship him, and one day, when so engaged,
the Garu.la said, "We Garu.las when catching Nâgas are often destroyed
by drowning, there must be some secret cause for this; when the Nâga
comes, ask him the reason and let me know." The ascetic agreed, and when
the Nâga came, he questioned him; and the Nâga said, "If I were to tell
this, all the future generations of Nâgas would be destroyed; but if you
will promise not to reveal it, I will tell you." The ascetic promised,
saying, "If I do, may my head be split in seven!" The Nâga then said,
"When the Garu.las are going to swoop, we make ourselves a thousand
cubits long and swallow a great rock and then show fight with our heads,
so when the Garu.las seize our heads they cannot lift us and get
drowned; but if the Garu.las seized us by the tail and held us upside
down, we should vomit the rock." The hermit, however, did not keep his
promise, but told the Garu.la. The Garu.la, therefore, went and seized
the Nâga, and whilst he was being carried off, he told the Garu.la how
he had been deceived. The Garu.la took pity on him, and telling him that
it is always best to keep secrets, let him go. The Nâga then wished that
the punishment of oath-breaking should befall the hermit, and
immediately his head split into seven pieces and he went to Avici.\]

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span> them by the tail. This Garu.la, however,
not knowing the right way, seized this Nâga by the head, and carried it
off wriggling to the Himavanta forest. There was also at that time in
the country of Kâsi an ascetic Brahman, who dwelt occasionally in a cell
in the Himavanta, near which there was a great banyan tree, and as this
hermit was sitting at the foot of the tree, the Garu.la flew past with
the Nâga. The Nâga twisted its tail round the branches of the banyan
tree, but the strength of the Garu.la was such that it carried off the
tree with the Nâga, without being aware that it had done so. The
Garu.la, perched in a tree, devoured the Nâga's entrails, and threw the
body into the sea, whereupon the banyan tree fell with a crash. The
Garu.la looked round to see what it was, and thought, "Why, this must
have been the banyan tree, that grew by the hermit's cell. I must go and
find out whether he is angry with me for what has been done." So he flew
down to the hermit's cell, and, having taken up a reverent attitude,
said, "O hermit, what is this level spot!" The hermit answered, "O
Garu.la, my supporter, a Garu.la came flying by here with a Nâga, and as
he passed the Nâga twisted its tail in the banyan tree and it was
carried away." "Is the Garu.la to be blamed, O hermit?" "No, Garu.la,
the Nâga did it in self-defence; and is not to be blamed." "Reverend
Sir, I am that Garu.la, and I am much gratified at the manner in which
you have replied to my questions; I know a charm that will keep <span
id="page_100">p. 100</span> off all serpents, and will impart it to you
for your kindness." The hermit answered, "I have no need for
snake-charms, go in peace." But the Garu.la insisted and taught him the
charm.

   There was also at this time a poor Brahman in Bârâ.nasi who was sore
pressed by his creditors, so he went out into the forest, saying, "It is
better that I should die there than continuing to live in this wretched
manner." In due course he came to this hermit's cell, and served the
hermit in many ways, and in return the hermit imparted to him the
snake-charm, which had been taught him by the Garu.la, and also gave him
some of the medicine which had been given him. The poor Brahman, having
now got a means of livelihood, stayed a day or two longer, and then
saying he had got the rheumatism, and wanted to get medicine for it,
took his departure. After a short time he arrived at the banks of the
Yamunâ, and went along the road repeating his charm. Just then a
thousand of Bhûridatta's female attendants came, bringing with them the
great wishing ruby, and, whilst they disported in the water, placed it
on a sand-bank, to give forth its light during the watches of the night.
At dawn they put on their ornaments, and, surrounding the great ruby,
displayed their splendour. As the Brahman came up, the Nâgas heard him
reciting his charm, and, thinking he was a Garu.la, fled, leaving the
ruby, on seeing which the Brahman was delighted and carried it off.

   Just then the Brahman, Nesâda, and his son, Somadatta, came out of
the forest, and, seeing the Brahman carrying the ruby, he said, "Dear
Somadat, is not this the ruby that the Prince Bhûridat offered us?"
"Yes, father, it is the very same." "Then (said Nesâda) we will get it
by stratagem, for he does not know its value." Somadatta answered,
"Father, when Prince Bhûridatta offered it to you, you refused it; why
do you want it now? Perhaps the Brahman will be too sharp for you. Do
not speak to to him, but keep still." But Nesâda answered, "That may be,
but just see how we shall both try to get round one another."

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

   He then said to the snake-charmer:

   Then said Nesâda, "O snake-charmer, the nature of rubies is such that
if one looks after and honours them, they bring great luck to their
owners; but if they are not well looked after, they bring harm. You are
not the sort of person to carry about a ruby, sell it me for a hundred
pieces of gold. I know how to treat it." (Nesâda had not a hundred
pieces of gold, but he thought that if he once got it into his
possession, he would soon get the hundred pieces.)

   Then said Somadatta; "I will flee from thee, for I cannot remain with
one who can do such evil deeds." So with a mighty cry he called on the
Devas to witness that he could no longer remain with so base a father,
and fled into the Himavanta forest, where he became a hermit and
attained so much merit that he at last migrated to the Brahma heavens.

   Nesâda, thinking that his son had gone home, and that the
snake-charmer was heavy of heart, said, "Friend snake-charmer, do not be
unhappy, I will show you Bhûridatta the Nâga Prince." He then took him
to where Bhûridatta was fasting, and when they got there, and saw him on
the top of the ant hill, he stopped and said, pointing at him:

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   Hearing this, Bhûridatta opened his eyes, and beholding Nesâda,
thought, "That man wishes to do me a mischief whilst I am fasting. I
took both him and his son to Nâga-land, and when they wished to depart,
I offered them precious stones, but he would not take them, and now he
has come with this snake-charmer. If I were to show my wrath to this
Brahman, who is so treacherous to his friends, my

<span class="small">\[1. The Mandalay MS. has eso kâyo paddissati *his
body is to be seen*; Fausböll, eso kayassa dissati.\]</span>

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span> fasting would be of no avail. It is
better to pursue this course of religious duties than to be irritated.
If this serpent-charmer wishes to cut me in twain, let him do so: if he
desires to cook me, he may do so; or toast me on a spit, he may do so: I
will not be angry. If I were to look at those two, in my wrath, they
would melt like cakes of honey; but I will not, and if they smite me,
yet will I not be enraged." Then, closing his eyes in fixed
determination, he withdrew his head into his coils and lay motionless.

   Then said Nesâda again, "Snake-charmer, seize this serpent and give
me the ruby." Whereupon the snake-charmer in delight threw him the ruby,
saying, "Take it, brother." But the ruby slipped through his fingers and
falling to the earth, disappeared, going back to serpent-land. When
Nesâda saw that the ruby was gone and his son too, and that he had also
lost his friend Bhûridatta, he said, "Alas! I have greatly erred in not
listening to the advice of my son," and he wept bitterly.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   The snake-charmer then, having smeared himself all over with ointment
to protect him, and having recited his charm, approached the Bodhisat,
and seizing him by the tail, grasped him firmly by the head. He then
opened his mouth, and having put drugs into it, spat into it.

   The Bodhisat, however, for fear that he might lose the merit of his
religious duties, remained unangered and with closed eyes.

   Then the snake-charmer held him by the tail,and shaking his head
downwards, caused him to vomit, and then laying him at full length,
kneaded him like a piece of leather.

<span class="small">\[1. The Mandalay MS. does not give S. 64.\]</span>

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span> Then again taking him by the tail he
banged him up and down, like one who washes clothes. Still, though the
Bodhisat underwent all this misery, he showed no anger. The
snake-charmer having thus taken all the strength out of him, and woven a
basket of canes, put him into it. As the body of the Nâga Prince was
larger than the basket, the snake-charmer pressed him into it with his
heel, and having thus forced him into it, carried him off to the
neighbouring village, where he summoned the people to see a performance.
When the people were assembled, he cried out, "Come forth, prince of
serpents." The Bodhisat, thinking that it would be better to come out
and dance, so that the Brahman might get a considerable amount of money,
and then release him, came forth and did all that the snake-charmer
ordered him to do. When the people saw him go through this performance,
there was not a dry eye amongst them, and they threw their gold and
silver ornaments to the Brahman: and in that village alone he got
property worth a thousand pieces.

   Now it happened that when the snake-charmer caught Bhûridatta, he had
determined to let him go again, after he had accumulated a thousand
pieces of silver; but being a covetous man, he broke this good
intention, and having made a handsome decorated cage and purchased a
comfortable carriage, he went from town to town, surrounded by many
followers, and at last arrived at the city of Bârâ.nasi. He fed
Bhûridatta on parched corn and honey, and caught frogs for him, but the
Bodhisat refused to eat, seeing that he would not be released; however,
the snake-charmer made him dance in all the quarters of the city. On the
15th day of the month, which was a holiday, he obtained permission to
give a performance before the Râjâ, and tiers of seats were erected on
the plain before the palace.

   Now on the day that Bhûridatta was caught, his mother, Samuddajâ,
dreamt that "A man, with red eyes, cut off her right arm with a sword
and carried it away streaming with blood." She sprang up in terror,
feeling for her arm, <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> but finding it
was there, knew that it was only a dream. Then she thought this evil
dream must portend some great calamity to her or her husband, and said,
"Verily, I am in great fear for my son Bhûridatta, for all the others
are in Nâga-land, but he has gone to fast in the country of men: I fear
that he has been seized by a snake-charmer, or a Garu.la." On the 15th
day after this dream she thought. "It is more than half a month since
Bhûridatta came here; I feel certain some evil has befallen him." So she
began to weep, and her heart dried up with grief. She was always gazing
on the road expecting to see him come. After a month had expired her
eldest son, Sudassana, came to see her, but on account of her grief she
said nothing to him. So Sudassana, seeing how different his reception
was, said:

   "Let us then go to the home of my dear son Bhûridatta and see how it
fares with thy brother, who is keeping the fast." So they set out
together with a large retinue.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   Now when Bhûridatta's wives were unable to find him at his place on
the ant hill, they were not alarmed, but thought he had probably gone to
see his mother, and being on the way to inquire, they met her on the
road, and told her that he had been absent for more than half a moon,
and thought he had gone to her. When they found this was not the case,
they fell at her feet weeping. His mother joining in their lamentations,
went with them up into his palace, saying:

   As Bhoga and Ari.t.tha, the younger brethren, were coming to pay
their respects to their parents, they heard the sound of the wailing,
and came to Bhûridatta's palace to comfort their mother, saying,
"Mother, be comforted; no mortal can escape the law of death and
destruction."

   Their mother replied, "Dear sons, I know that all that exists is
destroyed, but, nevertheless, I am terribly disturbed at not seeing
Bhûridatta. Dear Sudassana, if I see not my son Bhûridatta, I shall die
this very night."

   The Princes answered, "Dear mother, be not afraid, we will go into
the forest, the mountains, the caves, the villages, towns, cities, and
everywhere in search of Bhûridatta. You shall see him within seven
days."

   Sudassana said, "If we search together, the search will be long; we
will separate and search in different directions. One of us will go to
the Deva-land, one to Himavanta, and one to the country of men." As
Kâ.nâri.t.tha was fierce, he thought it best not to send him amongst
men, for he might reduce everything to ashes; so he said, "Brother
Ari.t.tha, do you go to Deva-land, and as the Devas are desirous of
hearing the law, without fail bring him thence."

<span class="small">\[1. Stanzas 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86 of Fausböll are

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

   He then directed Sûbhoga to go to Himavanta, saying that he himself
would go to the land of men. Then he thought, "If I go as a youth, men
will think nought of me; but if I go as a hermit, they will respect me,
for the children of men love hermits." Thereupon he took the form of a
hermit and took leave of his mother.

   Now Bhûridatta had a cousin<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> who was very fond of him, named
Ajamukhî.<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> She loved him
better than all her other cousins, and seeing Sudassana about to depart,
she said, "Cousin, I am very sad, let me accompany you in your search
for Bhûridatta!" He answered, "Child, I am going disguised as a hermit,
and it will not do for a woman to go with me." Then she said, "I will
take the form of a frog and go in your hair-knot." On his agreeing to
this Ajamukhî took the form of a frog, and stowed herself away in
Sudassana's top-knot.

   Sudassana then caused Bhûridatta's wives to show him the ant hill,
and when he saw traces of blood, and the spot where the snake-charmer
had woven the cage of cane and bamboo, he said, "Without doubt my
brother has been taken by a snake-charmer, who is ill-treating him." So
in great sorrow he tracked the bloodstains and footprints until he came
to the village where the first performance was held. On questioning the
villagers, as to whether any snake-charmer had been there, he was told
that one had been there about a month previously. On asking if he had
taken any money, they said, "O yes, he is quite a rich man, for he got
about a thousand pieces of silver here." So they went on making
inquiries until they came to the King's palace. Just at this moment the
snake-charmer, who had bathed and dressed himself, had taken up his cage
and gone to the gate of the palace, and the people of the city were
assembled to see the performance. The snake-charmer spread out a
magnificent carpet, placed his cage open upon it, and playing on his
drum, cried out, "Come forth, great

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span> Nâga." Sudassana, standing in the
crowd, saw the serpent-prince raise his head and gaze at the crowd. Now
there are two occasions on which Nâgas are wont to gaze; first, when
they are in fear of Garu.las: second, when they see a friend.

   The Bodhisat, seeing his brother in the crowd disguised as a hermit,
came out of the cage with his eyes streaming with tears, and went
straight towards his brother. The people stood aside with fear, but
Sudassana kept his place. The serpent, laying his head on Sudassana's
instep, wept. Sudassana also wept. Then Bhûridatta returned to his
cage.<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> The snake-charmer,
fearing that the snake had bitten the hermit, came towards him, saying
in verse:

   Now, when the snake-charmer saw the Râjâ coming with the hermit, he
thought, "Of a truth this is no ordinary hermit, he is in all
probability the Râjâ's teacher." So he came up to Sudassana, and said:

|      |                                                                                                                                              |

   Sudassana replied,

| 98\. |    "Snake-charmer, I show disrespect to no one with my art; but you are deceiving people by showing off a harmless snake."    |
| 99\. |    "Even thus too, I will make it known to all men, and you, Âlamba, will not get a handful of chaff, where then thy wealth?" |

   At this the snake-charmer was enraged and said:

   Then he cried, "Ajamukhî, come forth from my top-knot, and stand in
my hand." Then, opening his hand, he stood in the midst ot the assembly,
and Ajamukhî, uttering three cries, leapt on to his shoulder, and
dropped three drops of poison into his hand, and then went back into the
knot of hair. Then Sudassana shouted with a loud voice and said, "Now
shall the kingdom of Bârâ.nasi be destroyed." His shout went through the
whole kingdom of Bârâ.nasi, even to the distance of twelve yujana.

   When the King heard it he said, "O hermit, why wilt thou destroy the
kingdom of Bârâ.nasi?"

   "O King," answered Sudassana, "I see nowhere that this poison may be
poured."

   *King*. "Then, Hermit, I know not where you are to throw the poison,
but please find some place, or my kingdom will be destroyed."

   *Sudass*. "Dig me here three pits in a line."

   When the pits were dug, Sudassana filled one with drugs, the middle
one he ordered to be filled with cow dung, and into the third he put
some fairy medicines. Then he cast the three drops of poison into the
first hole, and instantly flame and smoke burst forth, which caught the
cow dung in the middle pit, and then passing to the third pit was
extinguished there.

   The snake-charmer was standing near the holes, and the flames taking
hold of him, his skin peeled off, so that he became a white leper, on
which, in his terror, he cried out thrice, "I release the Nâga King."

   On hearing this, Bhûridatta came forth from his basket, showing his
jewelled body, resplendent, like Sakka himself. Sudassana and Ajamukhî
also showed themselves in their true forms.

   Then said Sudassana, "Râjâ, do you not know us? Know you not whose
children we are? Have you forgotten that Samuddajâ, the daughter of the
Râjâ of Kâsi, was given in marriage to Dhattara.t.tha, the King of
Nâgas?" "Yes," said the Râjâ, "she was my sister." "O Râjâ, we are her
children and you are our uncle."

   The King then embraced Sudassana and Bhûridatta, and, <span
id="page_119">p. 119</span> having taken them into the palace, made them
presents, and said, "Dear Bhûridatta, since you are so powerful, how
came you to get into the clutches of this snake-charmer?"

   Bhûridatta then told him the whole story.

   Then Sudassana said, "Dear uncle, our mother is in great distress at
not hearing any tidings of Bhûridatta; we cannot stay, but must depart."

   The King replied, "Very good, go quickly, but I, too, should like to
see my sister. How can it be managed?"

   Then Sudassana asked after his grandfather, and the Râjâ told him
that he was so terrified that the day after he had given Samuddajâ in
marriage, he had relinquished his kingdom and become a hermit. Sudassana
then told the Râjâ that if he would appoint a day, they would bring
their mother to meet him at their grandfather's hermitage. The Râjâ then
conducted them on their journey, and they returned to serpent-land.

 

CHAPTER. IV. (*Micchâditthikathâ*.)<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   When Bhûridatta returned, the whole country was convulsed with
weeping, and he, being much distressed by a month's confinement in the
snake-charmer's basket, retired to sleep in his palace. Innumerable
numbers of Nâgas came to see him, but he was unable to converse with
them on account of his weakness. Kâ.nâri.t.tha, who went to Deva-land,
and returned home before him, placed a guard at the palace door to
prevent the people going to see Bhûridatta.

   Subhoga, having searched the whole of the Himavanta, was returning by
the Yamunâ. Now the Brahman Nesâda, when he saw the snake-charmer become
a leper, thought that, as he had coveted the ruby and taken part in the
affair, some terrible calamity would overtake him; so he determined to
go to the Yamunâ and bathe himself. He therefore went down to the
bathing-place<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> and entered the

\[1. Micchâditthi Kathâ, heretical discourse.

2\. Payâga ti.t.the, now Allahabad.\]

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span> water. Just at that moment Subhoga
arrived there too, and, hearing Nesâda make his confession, said, "This
is the wretch who, through covetousness for my brother's ruby, not
content with the great wealth that he had offered him, pointed him out
to the snake-charmer. I will slay the villain." So coiling his tail
round the Brahman, he dragged him under the water. Being tired, he
allowed the Brahman's head to come up, and then dragged him down again.
At last the Brahman got his head up, and was able to say:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                   |

Nesâda thought, "Verily this is Bhûridatta's brother; if I cannot do
something to preserve my life, he will undoubtedly slay me. I will try
and soften his heart by praising the well-known splendour and tenderness
of his parents." Then he said,

| 136\. |    "These Brahmans, Subhoga, are like the surface of the earth in which we ought to plant the seeds of good works. On the east, west, south and north, Brahmans are the only things we ought to desire." |

 

   Thus Ari.t.tha, in fourteen gâthâ, praised Brahman sacrificial rites
and the Vedas.

 

CHAPTER V. (*The Bodhisat's Discourse*)

   At that time all the Nâgas there assembled thought that what
Ari.t.tha said was true, and Bhûridatta lay there listening to him; so,
in order to dispel the wrong impression that had been given them, he
thus addressed them: "Kâ.nâri.t.tha, what you have said regarding
sacrifice and the Vedas is not true; the Brahmans by their arrangement
of the Vedas cannot be considered good men.

   After this he recited the following twenty-seven stanzas, to show the
erroneous practices of Brahmans:

137\.

   "Loss to the wise, a gain to fools, is skill in the Vedas, Ari.t.tha;
mirage-like when reflected on, their delusions take away wisdom."

138\.

   "The Vedas are no protection to any one, not even to the perfidious
and evil man. The worshipped fire too, gives no protection to the
evil-doer."

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

139\.

   "Rich and wealthy mortals may set fire to food mixed with grass, but
who can satisfy it? Fire, which is unlike all else, cannot be satisfied,
O double-tongued one.

140\.

   "As milk by its changeable nature turns to curd and also to butter;
so fire, by its changeable nature, is made by him who uses the
fire-sticks."

141\.

   "One sees not the fire that is inherent in the dry wood or green. If
the fire-stick is rubbed not by man, fire is not made, it burns not."

142\.

   "If fire dwell hidden both in dry wood and green too, all the green
would be dry in this world; the dry wood would burst into flames."

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

143\.

   "If one makes merit with the smoke and flame of wood and grass, then
charcoal-burners, salt-boilers, cooks and even corpse-burners would heap
up to themselves merit."

144\.

   "If they in truth do not a good deed, no one in this world can get
merit by appeasing the Brâhminical fire."

145\.

   "Wherefore does this world, revered being, eat, O double-tongued one,
things which smell bad and which are rejected?"

146\.

   "Some say that flame is a god, and Milakkhas (heathens) say that
water is a god, but all have a wrong opinion; fire is not one of the
gods, nor water."

147\.

   "How shall evil-doers go to heaven by doing honour to fire, which is
perceptibly mindless and the servant of men?"

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

148\.

   "You say that Brahma became the ruler of all things through serving
fire here in this life. If he created all and controls all, the
uncreated worships the created."

149\.

   "A thing to be derided, a lie; wishing to be honoured they have lied
of old; they for their own gain which was not before apparent have
concocted their own law for men."

150\.

   "(Which is) For teaching Ariya, for the earth men rulers, Vesyas for
tilth, as servants of all Suddas. Each for his own station were made,
they say, by Brahma."

151\.

   "If these words were true as spoken by the Brahmans, none but
Khattiyas would reign, none but Brahmans would teach wisdom's sayings."

152\.

   "None but Vesyas would till land; Suddas would not be free from
service; these words are false: they speak lies for the sake of their
bellies."

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

153\.

   "Such things fools only believe, wise men and they themselves see
through it: Khattyas pay tribute to Vesyas, and Brahmans go about
carrying weapons: such a shaken-up, scattered world, why does not Brahma
put straight?"

154\.

   "If verily Brâhmâ rules the world, and if he be the great king of
men, how can he behold the world thus unfortunate, why does he not make
the whole world happy?"

155\.

   "If verily Brâhmâ the king of the world be lord of all mortals. By
delusion, lying, magic and lawlessness, why has he made this world?"

156\.

   "Verily if Brâhmâ be the lord of the world and ruler of all beings,
he is a lawless ruler, Ari.t.tha; though there be law, he rules
lawlessly."

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

157\.

   "'Caterpillars and insects, snakes and frogs, and worms, and
flies,<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> they slay and are
innocent;' these opinions of the people of Kamboja are dishonourable
(non-Brahminical); they are false."

 

   After this he recited the following 27 stanzas to show the erroneous
practices of Brahmans:--

158\.

   "If he is pure who slays, and the slayer enters Svagga, would not the
Brahmans slay one another, and those too who believe in them?"

159\.

   "Nor wild beasts, nor cattle, nor oxen, request their own slaughter;
there whilst alive they struggle at the sacrifice; they drag cattle by
exertion."

160\.

   "Those fools having bound cattle to the post, with vanity make bright
your face (saying), 'This sacrificial post will give you all desires in
the next world, and they will last in the future.'"

<span class="small">\[1. The Mandalay MS. reads bhinga, for bheka, and
translates it "carpenter bees."\]</span>

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

161\.

   "Verily, if there be silver, gold, gems, shells and all kinds of
wealth in the sacrificial post, in green wood and dry too, and all the
delights of Deva land, all those Brâhmans would sacrifice abundantly,
there is not a Brâhman who would not sacrifice."

162\.

   "How can gems, etc., and all the delights of the Devas, be in a post
in green wood and dry too?"

163\.

   "Both wicked, cruel, covetous and fools, rejoicing in all sorts of
vanities (they say) take fire, to me give wealth; then be blessed and
have all you desire."

164\.

   "Taking refuge in sacrifice, they rejoice with various vanities."

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

165\.

   "Like crows who have found an owl alone, they surround one in flocks,
and having eaten one's victuals they make a clean shave of one, and
throw one away at the sacrificial post."

166\.

   "Thus, deceived by the Brâhmans, being alone and they many: they with
their sayings get present wealth, for that which is unseen (illusory)."

167\.

   "When made their advisers by kings they carry off wealth. They are
such thieves, and worthy to be executed, yet are not slain."

168\.

   "In the sacrifice they cut the palasa pole, saying it is the right
arm of Indra; if that be true and Maghava is deprived of his arm, with
what does Indra subdue the Asuras?"

169\.

   "That too is false, for Maghava being all-powerful, slays them; he is
the chief Deva and cannot be slain. These Vedas are false, they are
illusions visible to all men."

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

170\.

   "Mounts Nâlâ, Himavayo, Gajjho, Sudassana, Nisabhogo, Kâkaneru, these
and other great mountains were brick made in sacrifice they say."

171\.

   "In this manner with bricks they are built in sacrifice, they say:
mountains are not made thus, they stand firm and unshaken, being of a
different nature."

172\.

   "Bricks become not rock by length of time, not thus arise iron and
copper."

173\.

   "They say that a strict and learned hermit was swallowed up by the
water when bathing on the shores of the ocean, and it is therefore
undrinkable."

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

174\.

   "More than a hundred virtuous hermits learned in the Vedas have the
rivers slain; their waters are not undrinkable. Why, then, is the
incomparable ocean undrinkable?"

175\.

   "Here in this living world there are salt-water holes that have been
dug: these have not slain Brâhma.ns; but, O two-tongued one, why is not
their water undrinkable?"

176\.

   "In the beginning of ages to whom was there a wife? Firstly, mind
created man. Therefore no one was base, and so in like manner they say
is the determination of Sagga."

177\.

   "Should a Candala learn the Vedas, and recite its verses, though
intelligent and virtuous, his head would be split into seven pieces:
they have made the verses for the purpose of slaying."

178\.

   "They teach words made for the sake of gain."

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

179\.

   "To lions, tigers and leopards there is not the energy of men." (This
is not clear.)

180\.

   "Verily, if a king subdued the whole world and his councillors were
obedient, he would conquer all his enemies, and his subjects would ever
be happy."

181\.

   "The instructions for Khattiyas and the three Vedas are similar in
purpose, and not being able to discern their deception, one cannot know
a word, as it were, covered with water."

182\.

   "The instructions for Khattyas and the three Vedas are one in their
purpose: profit and loss, honour and dishonour, these are the rules of
those four castes."

183\.

   "And as rich men desiring wealth and corn do much tillage on the
earth, so these Brahmans and Suddas do many works on earth."

   "They are like unto wealthy men, they are ever energetic in pleasure,
they do much tillage upon the earth; but, O double-tongued one, they are
witless in their pleasures."

 

   When the assembled Nâgas heard this discourse, they were delighted
and gave praise. Then Bhûridatta caused them to turn the Brahman Nesâda
out of serpent-land. Râjâ Sâgara Brâhmadatta, on the appointed day,
surrounded by his whole army, went to the place where his father was
residing.

   Bhûridatta caused it to be proclaimed by beat of drum throughout the
whole of Nâga-land, that he proposed visiting his grandfather and uncle:
and going forth from the river Yamunâ with a great retinue and
splendour, in due course, he arrived at his grandfather's hermitage. His
parents and brethren followed after him.

   When Sâgara Bhûridatta saw the Bodhisat coming with his attendants,
he did not recognize him, but said to his father in the following
stanzas (185 to 198):

   "O hermit, my father, who, I pray, is this who comes with drums and
other musical instruments playing before him? Whose face and crown is it
that flashes like lightning? He is young indeed, but his glory flashes
forth like gold flowing from the furnace? Who is he? His white umbrella
delighteth the heart like Jambûraj gold. Those waving câmâris,<sup><span

splendidly jewelled peacock fans?

   Then his father answered (199), "Dear son, this is no other than your
nephew, the son of Dhatara.t.tha, King of the Nâgas: those others are
also his men; their power is very great and their hosts are many. They
are also the sons of my daughter Samuddajâ."

   Whilst they were thus talking, the company of the Nâgas arrived and
sat down in a suitable place. Samuddajâ, after doing reverence to her
father, returned weeping to Nâga-land. Brâhmadatta remained two or three
days and then returned to Bârâ.nasi. Samuddajâ died in Nâga-land, and
Bhûridatta continued his fasts for the rest of his life, and when he
died he went to Deva-land with all his followers.

   The Teacher then summed up the Jâtaka as follows:

   Bhûridatta's parents were reborn of royal race; the hunter Nesâda
became Devadatta; his son Somadatta became Ânanda; Ajamukhî is now
Upalava.m.sa; Sudassena is Sariputtarâ; Subhoga is Moggalâna;
Kâ.nâri.t.tha became Sunnakkhat (Sunakkhatto, a Prince of the Licchavi)
and Bhûridatta is myself, the incomparable and omniscient Buddha.
