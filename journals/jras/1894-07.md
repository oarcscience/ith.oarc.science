> <span id="art">ART. VII.</span>--*The Story of Thuwannashan, or
> Suva.n.na Sâma Jâtaka, according to the Burmese version, published at
> the Hanthawati Press, Rangoon*. By R. F. ST. ANDREW ST. JOHN, M.R.A.S.

A PECULIARLY interesting feature of this Jâtaka is the fact that it has
undoubtedly been depicted on the western gateway of the Sanchi Tope
([Figure 1 in Plate xxxvi.](1894-07a) of Fergusson's "Tree and Serpent
Worship"), and will illustrate what curiously erroneous theories may be
evolved from imperfect data. I feel convinced that a complete knowledge
of the Jâtaka and other stories current in Buddhist literature would
enable one to explain most of the scenes depicted on these and other
Buddhist ruins. That trees and serpents were, and are, largely
worshipped is not to be denied, but I think it will be clearly seen from
this and other plates that Fergusson did not draw correct deductions
regarding the Sanchi and Amravati Topes. In his second edition he admits
this.

   Fergusson gives the dates of the Sanchi gates as first century A.D.;
if this be correct, it proves that this is one of the early Jâtaka, and
that the so-called ten greater Jâtaka are not all late compositions. At
[Plate xxxii.](1894-07b) of the northern gate we have the Vessantara
Jâtaka, and at <span id="page_212">p. 212</span> [Plate xxiv.
2](1894-07c) Bhûridatta. Below is what Fergusson says of Plate xxxvi. p.
138 of the first edition.

   "The upper portion of the plate represents one of those transactions
between the Hindus and Dasyus, which have probably only a local meaning.
. . . . .

   "In the centre of the upper part of the picture a Hindu chief, or
Râja, accompanied by his minister, is conversing with a Dasyu, whose two
wives, or daughters, are seen beyond him on his left hand.

   "On the Râja's right are two of the ordinary circular huts of the
Dasyus, in front of which a man and woman are seated naked. They are
sitting on their lower garments, and their upper cloaks are hung in
their huts. Two monkeys are playing above them. Between these two huts
is seen the fire-pot, which is almost an invariable accompaniment
whenever these Dasyus are represented. Below it is the water-pot, and
beside it the ladle or pincers. From their position here they would seem
to be the sacred implements of the tribe. Did fire and serpent worship
go together?" In his second edition, p. 151, he says:

   "Mr. Beal is of opinion that Fig. 1, Plate xxxvi. represents the
principal scenes of the Sâma Jâtaka as quoted below, and I am not
prepared to say this may not be correct; but, if so, the form of the
fable must have been considerably altered since the first century, at
Sanchi, the king, does not kill the boy by accident. He is being
deliberately shot by a soldier. The King is standing unarmed at some
distance with his minister beside him, talking to an ascetic,
accompanied by his two wives or daughters, and consequently not Dakhala,
which, otherwise, we might fancy him to be from the repetition of the
same figure occurring sometimes in these bas-reliefs.

   "It is probable that the figure in front of the Pansalas are meant to
be represented as blind, not only from their being naked, but also from
the monkeys stealing the fruit and pulling the thatch off the roof, with
other circumstances. The two figures in the centre do look like a
reduplication of the boy and the minister, and it is absolutely
necessary <span id="page_213">p. 213</span> it should be so if the Sâma
Jâtaka is to be identified at all with this sculpture. . . . It is going
rather too far to represent the King abdicating his throne and becoming
the slave of two blind hermits, because one of his soldiers had shot an
innocent boy!"

   Both Beal and Fergusson quote Hardy, whose summary of the Sâma Jâtaka
in Eastern Monachism is very brief.

   Where Fergusson got the idea of a minister and soldiers I cannot
understand. Nor can I agree with Beal in thinking that the figure
standing between Sâma and the archers is the Devi. It is clearly a man.

   I would suggest that we must look at this picture as composed of two
halves, the one to our right being the ordinary part of Sâma's life and
that to the left the extraordinary. On the right we see the blind Dukûla
and Pârikâ, and Sâma coming to draw water at the Migasammatâ, his usual
vocation. On our left the king shoots and then converses with him. Above
we see the Devi with Dukûla and Pârikâ making the "sacca kiriyâ," the
king, wearing his cloth ungirt in the usual manner, standing behind. He
then appears again in the centre, taking leave of Sâma and promising to
lead a good life. The head of a duck in the water behind the left hand
group shows that they are on the bank of a bend in the river.

   Mr. Beal's remarks are to be found in R.A.S. *Journal*, Vol. V. N.S.
p. 164.

 

*Suva.n.na Sâma Jâtaka*.<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   In the country of Savutthi there was a very rich merchant who had an
only son, and he was beloved by both his parents. One day, when looking
out of the window, he saw a number of people going to the Jetavan
monastery to hear the Buddha Gotama preach; so, taking

<span class="small">\[1. In the Gâta he is always called Sâma, and I
cannot find the word Suva.n.na. The number in Ceylon List is
543.\]</span>

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span> some flowers in his hand, he went with
them. After the sermon was over he asked to be admitted to the Order,
but the Buddha refused to admit him before he had obtained his parents'
consent. He accordingly returned home and made known his wishes to his
parents. They answered, "Alas! dear one, thou art the sole offshoot of
thy family, and the apple of our eyes--our very life. If thou leavest
us, how can we survive? We are getting old, and may die to-day or
to-morrow. Do not leave us to become a Monk."

   The youth, through grief, was unable to eat for seven days; so his
parents said, "Verily, if we do not give him leave he will die, and we
shall no longer behold him. It will be better to grant his request." So
they consented.

   The youth went with great joy into the presence of the Buddha and
requested to be admitted to the Order. The Lord thereupon summoned a
Monk and directed that he should be made a novice. After studying for
five years he thought, "There is too much to distract me here, and I
desire to complete myself in the Vipassanâdhura"; so, taking his
Kammathan, he left Jetavan, and went into an out-of-the-way part of the
country. However; after studying there for ten years, he was still
unable to obtain the "path" or "fruition." During those ten years his
parents had grown old, and, being robbed by their servants, were reduced
to great poverty. Only one small water-pot remained to them.

   At that time a Monk came out from Jetavan to the place where the
novice was. Falling into conversation, the novice enquired after the
health of the Buddha and his eighty chief disciples. Afterwards he made
enquiries regarding his parents.

   The Monk replied, "Good sir, do not ask me about them. They had an
only son, who became an ascetic, and from that day they have declined
and are now in abject poverty, begging their daily food."

   The novice burst into tears, and, on the Monk asking why he wept,
said, "O reverend sir, those poor ones are <span id="page_215">p.
215</span> my own parents." The Monk answered, "In that case, young sir,
your parents have been ruined through you; return and look after them."
The novice reflected thus: "Though I have studied with diligence for ten
years I have obtained neither 'the path' nor 'fruition.' I had better
forsake this life, and, through taking care of my parents and other good
works, obtain the Deva country."

   In the morning he handed over his cell to the Monk, and started for
Jetavan.

   Now at the back of the monastery there were two roads, one leading to
the monastery, and the other to the city. Standing there he reflected
thus: "Ought I first to pay my respects to my parents, or to Buddha? I
may see my parents for some time, but the Buddha only this day. I will
go at once to the Buddha, and to-morrow go to see my parents."

   Now that very morning the Excellent One had taken a survey of the
world, and had seen that the novice was on the point of attaining "the
path," so, when he arrived at the monastery, the Lord was preaching on
the "Sutta," called *Mâtuposaka*.

   The novice, sitting at the edge of the assembly, heard this beautiful
discourse, and thought, "I can leave the Order and look after my
parents. But the excellent Lord says, 'Even though you be a Rahan you
should repay your parents for the benefits they have conferred upon
you.' Verily, had I passed by without doing reverence to the Lord, I
should have been abased from the status of a Rahan, which is so
difficult to attain. I will not leave the Order, but remain in it and
look after my parents." Having made a reverent obeisance to the Lord he
left Jetavan and proceeded to Sâvatthi, and having begged his food and
taking it to the forest, became as if he were one who had merited
expulsion (Pârâjika).

   In the morning he went to beg his rice, and then to see if he could
find his parents. At the same time they, having begged their daily meal,
were sitting under the wall of <span id="page_216">p. 216</span> a
house, and the novice, seeing them, stood near with eyes full of tears
through grief for their miserable condition. They did not recognize him,
however, and his mother, thinking that he stood there waiting for food,
said, "Reverend sir, we are very poor and have nothing fit to offer you,
we beg your pardon." On hearing this the Monk still stood there with
streaming eyes and a bursting heart. Then his father said to his mother,
"Lady, go and see who he is." So his mother got up, and, going near,
recognized him. Like one who is mad she crouched at his feet and wept
bitterly. His father also embraced his feet and wept likewise. The Monk,
unable to restrain himself, wept also. At last, controlling his grief,
he said, "Be not afraid, dear parents, I will feed you." From that day
forth he begged and fed them. If he got sufficient for his own wants he
ate, but, if not, he fasted. If clothes were given him he presented them
to his parents, and after they had worn them out, he patched and dyed
them, and wore them himself. Through feeding his parents he became thin,
like a dry leaf.

   The Monks, who were his companions, then questioned him, saying,
"Sir, you were once very handsome, but now you are rough, dirty, and
withered; what ails you? Why do you give away the offerings made to you?
It is not lawful."

   He hid his head through shame and made no answer. The Monks went to
Buddha, and said, "Lord, this Monk makes away with the goods that are
presented to him." The Lord then sent for him and questioned him,
saying, "Dear sir, is it true that you give to men the things that are
bestowed upon you as offerings?" The Monk replied, "It is true, Lord. I
give them to my parents." The Lord replied, "Dear sir, it is well done,
it is well done. Thou art one who walkest in 'the path.' In former ages
I also supported my parents." The young Monk was comforted and the
Buddha remained silent.

   The Monks then asked the Buddha to relate the story of his former
existence, and he related as follows.

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

   In times long past, near Bârâ.nasi, there flowed a stream, and on one
side stood a village called Nesâdagâma, and on the other bank there was
also another village. Both were inhabited by fisher-folk, and governed
by headmen who from their youth were friends, and had engaged to give
their children in marriage to one another. In course of time to one was
born a son, to whom he gave the name of Dukûla; and in the other's house
was born a girl, to whom they gave the name of Pârikâ (or Pârimâ).

   These two were very handsome, and, though of the fisher caste, would
take no life.

   When Dukûla was sixteen his parents said, "Dear son, our friend's
daughter is very lovely, we wish you to marry her." But he, being one
who had just been born from the Brahma heavens, closed his ears, and,
though they pressed him again and again, refused.

   The parents of Pârikâ also pressed her to marry Dukûla, but she would
not.

   Dukûla then sent Pârikâ a secret message, to the effect that she had
better marry some one else, and she also sent a message to the same
effect. The parents forced them to wed, but, nevertheless, they embarked
not on the ocean of lust, but, with the consent of their parents, became
hermits. Leaving their native villages, they retired to Himavanta, and
following a tributary of the Ganges, called Migasammatâ, they at last
arrived in the forest. Sakka, becorning aware of their intention,
directed Visakrom to prepare a cell for them.

   Dukûla and Pârikâ, following a path, came to their cell, and seeing,
by the inscription, that it was intended for them, took off their
ordinary garments and put on the hermit's dresses that had been prepared
for them. They studied the Kâmâvacara Brahmavihâra, and became so imbued
with lovingkindness that all the birds and animals loved them, and
harmed them not. Every day they drew water from the stream, and went in
search of fruits. Living apart, they kept the rules of ascetics most
rigorously.

   One day Sakka came to see how they were getting on, and, <span
id="page_218">p. 218</span> foreseeing that their eyes would become
blind, approached them, and, addressing Dukûla, said, "Reverend sir, I
see that danger may befall you. Why do you not cohabit with your wife
and obtain a son?"

   Dukûla answered, "Lord Sakka, why dost thou say this? When we lived
amongst men we hated their ways, and now that we have become hermits how
can we act thus?" Sakka replied, "There is no need for you to do so,
but, at certain times, stroke Pârikâ's navel with your hand." He then
took his departure.

   When Dukûla told Pârikâ she consented. Just then the Bodhisat was
about to leave the Deva-heavens, so he took up his abode in the womb of
Pârikâ, who, in due course, bore a son, whom she named Suva.n.nasâma.
When Pârikâ went into the forest in search of fruits and roots the
Kinnari nursed him.

   At the age of sixteen Suva.n.nasâma was alone in the cell, whilst his
parents had gone out, and a great storm came on. They took refuge
beneath a tree on a mound, in which dwelt a huge serpent. The rain
washing the smell of their bodies into the serpent's nostrils it became
enraged, and spat forth its poison, so that they both became blind and
unable to find their way home.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> As his parents did not return at the
usual time, Suva.n.nasâma was alarmed, and determined to go and find
them, so he went into the forest shouting Father! Mother!

   When they heard him they answered, saying, "Do not come close, dear
one, there is danger." So he reached out his staff to them, and told
them to lay hold of it. Seeing they were both blind he first wept and
then laughed. On their asking why he rejoiced, he replied, "Dear Father
and Mother, I wept at the thought that you had become blind whilst still
so young, but when I remembered that I should now have to take care of
you, I rejoiced." He

<span class="small">\[1. This blindness is explained as follows: "In a
former existence Dukûla was a doctor and attended a rich man who would
not pay him. Being angry he went home and told his wife. The wife said,
'Go back and give him some medicine that will make him blind again.' He
acted on this advice, and the rich man again lost his sight."\]</span>

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span> then conducted them to the cell, and
from that day took care of them, going daily to the forest in search of
food. In this he was assisted by the Kinnaras.

   Now at that time there reigned in the city of Bârâ.nasi a king named
Pi.liyakkha, who was so fond of hunting deer that he left his kingdom in
charge of his mother, and went into the Himavanta to hunt them. One day,
after following the course of the Migasammatâ, he came to the place
where Suva.n.nasâma was accustomed to draw water. Seeing footsteps he
concealed himself in a thicket, holding his bow bent with a poisoned
arrow ready.

   In the cool of the evening, the Bodhisat, surrounded by deer, went
down to the stream to draw water. Pi.liyakkha was astonished at the
sight, and thought, "I have never seen anything like this before. Can it
be a man or a Deva? I will draw near. If he be a Deva he will fly up
into the sky, but if a Nâga he will sink into the earth, and I shall be
unable to tell my nobles what it is that I met with. I had better shoot
first and then see what it is." The Bodhisat had filled his pots and
bathed, and, having put on his red garment, came up the bank. As he came
Pi.liyakkha let fly his arrow, which entered at the right side and
pierced him through to the left.

   The Bodhisat, feeling that he was shot, and that the deer had all
fled, carefully set down his water-pots, and, turning his face in the
direction of the cell where his parents were, prostrated himself on the
sand and there lamented.

*Sâma.*

   "I am of the tribe of Nesâda, and my parents call me Sâma. O King of
Kâsi, behold me as I lie here bathed in blood, and pierced by thine
arrow, as if I were a deer. See how I spit blood. Since thou hast
mortally wounded me, I ask thee, O King, why thou hast shot me? Wast
thou in search of a leopard's skin or the tusks of an elephant? Why hast
thou shot me, O Râja."

 

*Pi.liyakkha.*

   "The deer that I aimed at, being near thee, was startled when it saw
thee and fled. Therefore, overcome by anger, I shot thee."

 

*Sâma.*

   "O King, how canst thou say this? There is not a deer in the whole
forest that would flee at the sight of me. From the time I began to know
my own intelligence, from that moment neither deer nor other wild beasts
fled from me. From the time that I first put on the red <span
id="page_221">p. 221</span> garment and attained youth, from that moment
the animals fled not at my approach. O King, the Kinnaras, who dwell on
the heights of Gandhamâdana, are a timid folk, but joyfully they
accompany me in the forest and delight in my presence. Would a deer,
then, be startled on seeing me?"

 

*Pi.liyakkha.*

   "O Sâma, why do I speak falsely? The deer was not startled by thee;
but in anger I let fly the arrow. Whence hast thou come, O Sâma, and by
whom wast thou sent to draw water in the river Migasammatâ?"

 

*Sâma.*

   "Blind are my father and mother, whom I cherish in this vast forest.
For them I draw water, coming to the Migasammatâ.

   "Alas! they, have but food for six days, and if water be not brought
them they will die. My inability to see my parents is a far greater
misery than the wound of this arrow. As for the pain caused by this
arrow, all men will have to bear pain in hell. But if I see not my
parents the smart will be far greater.

   "Alas! my parents will be left weeping for me, solitary and helpless.
Even now, O King, they are bewailing my absence, and wandering through
the forest calling for Sâma. This thought, indeed, is like a second
arrow that rends my heart. Ne'er again shall I behold those dear blind
ones."

 

*Pi.liyakkha.*

   "Weep not, O lovely Sâma, I will take up thy duties and feed them in
this vast forest. I, so skilled with the bow; I, who am so rough and
cruel; I will take upon me thy duties and feed thy parents; feeding them
with fruits and meat left by the lions and tigers. O Sâma, where is
their dwelling? Point it out quickly, and I will look after them as thou
didst."

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

 

*Sâma.*

   "By this footpath, O Râja, from the spot where I lie dying, having
gone not half the distance that a man's shout may reach, there thou
shalt find my parents' dwelling; there are my father and my mother.
Thither go and support them, Râja.

   The Râja promises to give the message and Sâma faints. Seeing that he
had stopped breathing, and was growing stiff, the king became terrified,
and, raising his hands to his head, lamented loudly, making the echoes
resound with his cries, saying, "Formerly I thought not of death, but
now that I see this Sâma dead before my very eyes, I know death must
come to all men. But now he was speaking to me, and now through the
power of this poisonous arrow he will speak no more, and I, who have
slain this innocent one, must go to hell. For ages and ages I shall
suffer, and I shall be known and reviled in every village as the king
who did this terrible thing. Who is there in this vast forest, remote
from men, who can revile me? In the towns and villages where men
congregate let the memory of this sin be made known. Now I know that
death must come to all, for I have seen it."

   When Pi.liyakkha was thus bewailing his wretched fate and wickedness,
the Devi Bahusundarî, who dwelt on the Gandhamâdana peak, and who
watched over the Bodhisat like a mother, looked out to see how things
were going with him, and seeing that he had been shot with an arrow, and
that Pi.liyakkha was loudly lamenting over him as he lay on the silvery
sands of the Migasammatâ, said, "Verily, if <span id="page_223">p.
223</span> I do not go quickly my son will die, Pi.liyakkha's heart will
break, and in consequence Sâma's parents will die of starvation. If
Pi.liyakkha takes the water-pots to Sâma's parents he will be able to
tell them, and bring them to the place where Sâma is lying. If he brings
them there, both Dukûla, Pârikâ, and myself will make a solemn
asseveration, the power of the poison will disappear, and Sâma recover
his health. Dukûla and Pârikâ will also regain their sight, and King
Pi.liyakkha, having listened to the Law preached by Sâma, return to
Bârâ.nasi, make great offerings, and on his death go to Deva-land."

   Bahusundarî, therefore, flew to the river Migasammatâ, and, hovering
in the air, unseen, thus addressed Pi.liyakkha.

 

*Bahusundarî.*

   "An evil deed hast thou done, Mahârâja, for thou hast slain three
innocent persons with one arrow. Come hither and I will instruct thee
how to support those blind ones, and so obtain a blessed hereafter."

   On hearing these words Pi.liyakkha resolved to devote himself
entirely to the support of Dukûla and Pârikâ. Then doing reverence to
the corpse, and covering it with flowers, he poured out a libation and
passed thrice round it. Then, after doing reverence to the four quarters
of the heavens, he lifted the water-pots, with a heavy heart, and took
the path leading southwards.

 

*Dukûla.*

   "Whose is the sound of these footsteps? Can it be a man who comes
hither? They are not the footsteps of Sâma, for he treads lightly. Who
art thou, good sir?"

 

*Pi.liyakkha.*

   "I am the Râja, of Kâsi, and I am named Pi.liyakkha. In pursuit of
the red deer I have left my kingdom. Skilled am I in the use of the bow
and well known for my strength. No elephant that comes within reach of
my arrow can escape."

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

 

*Dukûla.*

   "Hail Mahârâja! May thy coming be propitious. Make known thy wishes.
Here are tinduka and other fruits sweet and pleasant. Eat them,
Mahârâja, for they are choice ones. Here, too, is cool water brought
from the mountain rill. Drink, Mahârâja, drink freely."

 

*Pi.liyakkha.*

   "Who, then, has brought ye these fruits, O blind ones? Ye have so
choice a collection that I think ye are not really blind."

 

*Dukûla.*

   "O Râja, these fruits were not brought by us, but by our son, our
youthful Sâma. A youth of goodly mien. He has taken his pitcher to the
Migasammatâ to get water for our use and ought to be returning."

 

*Pi.liyakkha.*

   "Alas, hermits, I have slain with a poisoned arrow the beauteous
Sâma, who supports you. That Sâma whose locks are long and black. This
Sâma, whom I have unfortunately slain on the banks of the Migasammatâ,
lies blood-stained on the silvery sand."

 

*Pârikâ.*

   "Dukûla, who is this who speaks of the death of Sâma? At his words I
tremble as though my heart would break."

 

*Dukûla.*

   "It is the Lord of Kâsi, who says that he has slain Sâma whilst
shooting deer near Migasammatâ. Be not angry."

 

*Pârikâ.*

   "Why should I not be angry when he has slain our darling son?"

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

 

*Dukûla.*

   "Pârikâ, though he has slain the dear son who supported us in our
blindness, it is not good to be angry. Anger brings not a good result."

   Dukûla and Pârikâ beat their breasts and wail.

 

*Pi.liyakkha.*

   "Alas! Dukûla and Pârikâ, I have slain your Sâma. Weep not thus for
your dear one, for I will support you in this desolate wilderness. I am
skilled in the use of the bow, and will supply your wants. Flesh and
fruits will I bring to you, and cool water from the spring. Be not
afraid. I desire not to be Râja, but will wait upon you till my life's
end."

 

*Dukûla and Pârikâ.*

   "'Tis not lawful, Mahârâja, that thou shouldest wait upon us. Thou
art our Lord, and we venerate thy feet."

 

*Pi.liyakkha.*

   "O hermits, who are of the tribe of Nesâda, henceforth ye shall be
honoured. Thou, Dukûla, shalt be my father, and thou, Pârikâ, my
mother."

 

*Dukûla and Pârikâ.*

   "Hail to thee Râja, of Kâsi! Hail to thee, Kâsi's protector! With
supplicant hands we entreat thee to lead us where Sâma is lying, so that
when we have caressed his lovely face and feet we may ourselves follow
in his footsteps."

 

*Pi.liyakkha.*

   "My friends, Sâma, whom, alas, I have killed with my arrow, is dead
in this vast forest of Himavanta, that is full of all manner of terrible
beasts. For this night, I pray you, remain in your cells."

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

 

*Dukûla and Pârikâ.*

   "Though in this far-stretching forest there are beasts in hundreds
and thousands we fear them not in the slightest, no hurt nor harm will
they do us."

 

*The Buddha.*

   O Bhikkhus, Pi.liyakkha, being unable to prevent them from going,
took them by the hand, and led them to the place where Sâma was lying.

   On beholding (P. Disvâna patitam Sâmam: though they were blind) Sâma
lying in the forest besprinkled with dust, like the sun or the moon that
has fallen to the earth, his mother, afflicted by grief, then solemnly
made an asseveration.

 

*Pârikâ.*

   "By virtue of the fact that my son Sâma strictly performed all the
duties of a Brahmacâri: by the virtue of those duties may the poisonous
venom of the arrow disappear."

   "My son Sâma was ever truthful: by the power of that virtue may the
poison disappear."

   "My Sâma was ever dutiful to his parents: by the power of that virtue
may the poison disappear."

   "My Sâma was ever respectful to his parents and his elders: by the
power of that virtue may the poison disappear."

   "I loved my Sâma more than life: by the power of that love may the
poison disappear."

   "If there be any merit accruing to thee, dear son, or to me, or thy
father, of which we have taken no account: by virtue of that merit may
the power of the poison pass away."

   Dukûla, perceiving a slight movement, cried out, "My son still
lives," and then proceeded to make an asseveration in the same words.
Sâma rolls over on to his other side, and the Devi Bahusundarî
continues:

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

 

*Bahusundarî.*

   "Long have I dwelt in Gandhamâdana. None other have I loved but Sâma,
who was as my own son: by the power of this love may the poison be
assuaged."

   "As the forests of Gandhamâdana are full of sweet scents, and there
is not a single tree therein that is not sweet scented, so may the venom
of the poison pass away."

 

*The Buddha.*

   Dear Bhikkhus, as soon as Bahusundarî had completed her asseveration
the power of the poison disappeared, like rain drops from a lotus leaf,
and Sâma rose up quickly with his wound healed, so that one could not
tell where he had been hit.

   By the power of the Devi they were all transported back to Dukûla's
cell, and Dukûla and Pârikâ recovered their sight.

 

*Sâma.*

   "O revered ones, behold your Sâma once more restored to health. Weep
not, I pray, any longer, but speak only that which is pleasant."

 

(Turning to *Pi.liyakkha*.)

   "O Râja, of Kâsi, may thy coming be propitious. If there is anything
in this place that thou desirest, speak. Tinduka and other sweet fruits,
mangoes, oranges, and citrons, all are here; take, eat, I pray thee.
Here is water from the deep pools of the mountain stream--cool and
refreshing. Eat and drink, O Râja."

 

*Pi.liyakkha.*

   "O Sâma, I know not what to believe. Everything around me is in a
haze, for I see thee again, O Sâma, risen from the dead. How didst thou
come to life again?"

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

 

*Sâma.*

   "Mahârâja, thou thoughtest that one who had become unconscious by
reason of excessive pain was really dead. Mahârâja, men think that a man
is dead when his breathing is stayed by reason of his ceasing to
breathe."

   "When the Bodhisat had thus instructed him, and taught him the five
commandments, King Pi.liyakkha, after doing reverence, returned to
Bârâ.nasi and made a great offering. At the end of his days he went to
Deva-land.

   Sâma and his parents, at their death, went to the country of the
Brahmas.

   The Buddha then summed up the Jâtaka, saying, "The Râja, who was then
Pi.liyakkha, is now Ânanda; the Devi Bahusundarî is now Upalava.n.na,
the second amongst my Bhikkhunis; Sakka is now Anuruddha; Dukûla is
Mahâkassapa Thera; Pârikâ is now Bhaddakapila Therî; and Suva.n.nasâma
is I, the Buddha.

 

   *Note*.--Since writing the above I found a similar account of this
Jâtaka in Rajendralâla Mitra's "Indo Aryans," p. 203.
