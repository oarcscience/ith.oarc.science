ART. VII.--*The Namakkára, with Translation and Commentary*. By H. L.
ST. BARBE, B.C.S.

IN 1875, the Secretariat Press of British Burma printed a collection of
six Páli texts with a vernacular commentary and exposition. The fifth
and most difficult, but, at the same time, the most interesting of all,
is the one I am attempting to translate. The lack of critical editing
and the general corruption of the text is sufficiently shown in the
title *Namakára*, which may stand either for *Namakáya* 'a collection of
panegyrics,' or *Namakkára* (Sansk. {Sanskrit: *nmkhâr*}) 'Reverence,
worship.' The first stanza is a curious example of archaic punning. This
"ekatthá," or tautological repetition, as it is called by the learned
author of the "Subodhála"nkára," is only permissible when it is desired
to express fear, anger, or laudation. It is employed again in the 8th,
9th, and 22nd stanzas.

   I may observe that the last five stanzas are evidently the work of a
later writer.

 

NAMAKKÁRA.

TRANSLATION.

   <span id="pp_1"></span>1. I incline my head in praise of the Lord
Buddha the auspicious one<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> who
walks in the right path; supreme of beings who has left all states of
merit and demerit; who is freed from death and is the nectar (of
righteousness); without passion peerless and giver of the peerless gift;
the refuge and remembrancer<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>
of mankind: sinless himself and causing sinlessness; all secure and
guiding to the abode of security.

   <span id="pp_2"></span>2. I venerate the incomparable Buddha, with
limbs and body lovely to the eye; gifted with a voice sweet and noble;
the stay of a boundless multitude of virtues.

   <span id="pp_3"></span>3. I adore Buddha the blessing of gods and men
who is possessed of steadfast knowledge, endured for the sake of mankind
bodily and mental anguish.

   <span id="pp_4"></span>4. I adore the Sage who has reached his final
birth: who

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. The commentary translates this as "speaking good words." I can find
no trace of this meaning.

2\. Cf. *lokavidu*.\]

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span> has a body adorned with the 32 divine
marks and radiant with emanations of light: who is endued with wisdom,
fortitude, piety--a flood, in fine, of graces.

   <span id="pp_5"></span>5. I adore the omniscient Lord of sages, with
a face resembling the full moon, beauteous with splendour in the midst
of his monks, like the guardian sun at the early dawn.

   <span id="pp_6"></span>6. I revere the invincible, the conqueror of
Mára; the Buddha who, endued with merit at the foot of the noble Bodhi
tree, subdued Mára with his army, and enjoyed perfect knowledge at the
rise of dawn.

   <span id="pp_7"></span>7. I revere the being possessed of the miracle
of transcendent wisdom, with the sword of spotless knowledge that
cleaves asunder passion, holding the shield named reflection and adorned
with the ornaments of a crowd of virtues.

   <span id="pp_8"></span>8. I adore the all-seeing infinite one, the
abode of mercy who in each existence has overcome difficulties and who
after crossing the ocean of life has reached perfection; Lord of three
worlds, the friend endowed with exquisite beauty.

   <span id="pp_9"></span>9. I adore the overcomer of irreverent
fools,<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> who has accumulated a
store of perfection in each existence, who bestows the bliss reached
only by the good, and has become the cause of happiness of all mankind.

   <span id="pp_10"></span>10. I adore the Buddha dissipator of
suffering; the sage who like a skilful mariner, grasping the rudder of
exertion with the hand of knowledge, has embarked on the vessel of the
eight-fold path, and has with it crossed the manifold sea of existence.

   <span id="pp_11"></span>11. I worship the conqueror, the passionless
one, friend of gods and men, who bears the whole 33 perfections, who
perceived the four truths beneath the glorious Bodhi Tree and has
reached to miraculous power.

   <span id="pp_12"></span>12. I worship the conqueror supporter of the
universe, endowed with religion of lily-like<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> purity, with intellect wide as the
firmament and steadfastness like the stern mountain; the passionless one
with characteristics arising from a hundred virtues.

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. "namánamána"m jina pu"ngava"m gava"m." The last word is remarkable
used in this sense.

2\. *Jalaja* 'a lily.'\]

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

   <span id="pp_13"></span>13. I adore perpetually the Buddha
incomparable with any deity, who effulgent in his wisdom like the sun at
day, seated on the stone<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> seat
that produces delight, bestowed the law that leads to happiness and
beatitude.

   <span id="pp_14"></span>14. I adore the unequalled one friend of the
whole universe, the leader who with feet lily-soft in skin, and marked
with lines perfect and clear, has reached the immeasurable void.

   <span id="pp_15"></span>15. I revere Buddha the compassionate, the
supreme, of infinite wisdom, the union of gods and men, the<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> firm-minded one, who has destroyed
darkness with the splendour of his lamp of wisdom, and who, yearning for
their happiness, brings benefits to gods and men.

   <span id="pp_16"></span>16. I adore the peerless chief of sages, the
beauteous one deserving of worship, the receptacle of all the virtues,
who having proceeded to the Issipatana forest, the home of ascetics,
there started the wheel of the Law which destroys demerit.

   <span id="pp_17"></span>17. I affectionately adore the Buddha revered
by gods and men, gleaming with resplendent brilliance, amid his bright
retinue, the abode and sphere of effulgence, furnished with senses well
restrained and an accumulation of marks distinctive of the sun, moon and
other planets.

   <span id="pp_18"></span>18. I adore the Ruler of Religion, the abode
of holiness, giver of supreme bliss, who with the raft of the four paths
has crossed the flood of continued existence, billowy with the waves of
folly, hate and lust, and has reached the further shore of safety, the
home and refuge and haven of mankind.

   <span id="pp_19"></span>19. I adore the most excellent chief of sages
giver of supreme bliss, who seated at the foot of the Ka.n.da tree
swiftly wrought for the benefit of others a miracle *unleft by sages*
(munibhi ajahitam),--the sheen of fire and water undisturbed, marvellous
and pleasing to the eye and destroying all false glamour.

   <span id="pp_20"></span>20. I adore the Ruler, the long-suffering
one, the single eye of the universe, the sun-chief of sages, the
day-spring of compassion, the spacious sphere of wisdom, whose fame
permeates

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Alluding (says the commentary) to Sakka's throne, the
"pa.n.dukambala."

2\. Dhitatta"m.\]

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span> among all the pure of the three worlds
and who with the glorious rays of his religion enlightened those called
"the lily" among intelligent creatures.

   <span id="pp_21"></span>21. I adore the imperial conqueror who from
his love of wisdom gave in countless existences with unselfish mind
freely to the asker, wife and child and limb and life itself, and
fulfilled the perfection of charity besides the other
perfections,<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> and who from
their magic might has reached Transcendency.

   <span id="pp_22"></span>22. I adore<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> perpetually Buddha chief of sages, the
desire of the universe, who has forsaken sin, more divine than all the
gods, who has reached his final existence,<sup><span
class="small">\[3\]</span></sup> the invincible one who has vanquished
Mára, the lamp and shelter of mankind who attained supreme knowledge on
the noble couch of victory and announced glorious tidings to the Brahma
world.

   <span id="pp_23"></span>23. Buddha whose girth is like a banyan tree,
who has fair soft hands and feet, the voice of a Brahma, the legs of an
antelope, limbs soft as the sheath of a lily-bud; whose feet are firmly
set, whose hair is soft and white between the eyes (Burm. commentary
"like silver"), whose body is straight and erect as the Brahma kings,
whose eyes are dark, whose heel is long, whose skin is delicate and
whose nerves of sensation meet at the top of his back.

   <span id="pp_24"></span>24. Buddha who has forty teeth meeting at the
top, even and regular, a back<sup><span class="small">\[4\]</span></sup>
rounded and plump, feet characteristically marked, teeth without a
cavity, who standing with high instep can, unbending, touch his knees
with both his soft hands; whose neck is rounded, whose eyelashes are
delicate and whose body is like the upper part of a lion.

   <span id="pp_25"></span>25. Buddha who is plump in the seven parts,
whose fingers are long and who has a single hair growing in each hair
vesicle, whose canine teeth are white, whose skin is like pure gold,
with dark hair on the summit of his head; the All-wise whose
tongue<sup><span class="small">\[5\]</span></sup> is large, who has the
jaw of a lion, whose feet

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. The 10 páramis are dána, síla, nikkhama, paññá, viriya, khanti,
sacca, adhi.t.thána, mettá, upekkhá.

2\. satisam.

3\. nidhana vapu dhara"m.

4\. antara"m sappapíno.

5\. *i.e.* can reach from its looseness from right to left ear. The
Burmese commentary explains this attribute as meaning that his tongue
can cover his forehead and touch his hair.\]

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span> and hands are like a buckler, whose
head is crested; him I adore, the ruler gifted with all these
characteristics.

   <span id="pp_26"></span>26. In this world it is difficult to hear
"Buddha" "Buddha" even as an address; what then shall be said of the
state of a Buddha? Let the wise and virtuous therefore among men who
desire the various forms of happiness adore continually the peerless
Buddha, who increases the joy of the universe, who is all secure and
worthy of oblations, worshipped of gods and men and accomplishing each
man's desire.

   <span id="pp_27"></span>27. By virtue of this panegyric may I in the
future be subtle-minded and intelligent, content and clever, of
far-seeing wisdom and of unfailing vigour, prosperous and generous,
acute and courageous, firm-minded, helpful to myself and others,
long-lived and healthy, wealthy and handsome, famous and valiant,
renowned and endowed with patience.

   <span id="pp_28"></span>28. Moreover may I be faithful and
charitable, of pre-eminent fame, compassionate and unselfish, modest and
with virtuous friends, delighting in works of merit, observant of the
five duties of religion, wanting little and slow to wrath; of upright
heart and possessed of supernatural power; gaining infinite praise,
pleasant in speech, amiable and recognizing the virtues of others.

   <span id="pp_29"></span>29. Let the wise man call to mind but one
among these stanzas which reveal the characteristic qualities of the
Buddha.

   <span id="pp_30"></span>30. He will then escape the four states of
purgatory and obtain happiness in both worlds; he will break through the
web of adversity and obtain pleasure and happiness.

   <span id="pp_31"></span><span id="pp_32"></span><span
id="pp_33"></span>31-2-3. He will obtain sovereignty over gods and men
and the lordship of the four great islands and in his last existence
having mounted the chariot of meditation, bearing the white umbrella of
an Arahat, he will reach Nirvá.na. In this existence also he will be
healthy and long lived and universally respected, taking delight in
meditation, beloved of men, and amiable; what then shall be said of one
who remembers the whole series of stanzas?
