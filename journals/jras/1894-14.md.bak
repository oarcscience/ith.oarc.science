ART. XIV.--*The Madhura Sutta concerning Caste*. By ROBERT CHALMERS.

THE Sutta of which the Pâli text and commentary, together with a
translation, are here given, is No. 84 of the Majjhima Nikâya. In
addition to the interest which attends every addition to our knowledge
of the great canonical books of primitive Buddhism, this Sutta may claim
a twofold interest of its own, derived (i.) from the form in which the
dialogue is cast, and (ii.) from its subject.

   As regards the form, whilst the Madhura Sutta is unlike the
generality of Suttas in presenting as the chief interlocutor not the
Buddha himself but one of his disciples, yet it is not without parallels
in this respect. For example, in Sutta No. 44 of the Majjhima
Nikâya,<span class="small"><sup>\[1\]</sup></span> the learned Sister
Dhammadinnâ expounds the Truth to her whilom husband; whilst in Suttas
Nos. 15 and 43 Moggallâna and Sâriputta respectively play the chief
part, and there are not even the final words of approval with which in
No. 44 the Buddha endorses what Dhammadinnâ has taught. There is,
however, one essential point in which the Madhura Sutta is marked off
from even such Suttas as the three mentioned. For, whereas in all those
three, even in Nos. 15 and 43, we are carefully, if irrelevantly,
informed of the precise spot at which the Buddha was dwelling at the
time of the dialogue--in the Madhura Sutta it is expressly stated that
the Buddha was no longer living but dead. The only parallel which occurs
to me is found in the (unedited) Ghotamukha Sutta (No. 94 of the
Majjhima Nikâya), where the circumstances leading up to the statement
are precisely similar to those of the Madhura Sutta. The important

<span class="small">\[1. Analysed in Miss Foley's article in this year's
J.R.A.S.\]</span>

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

fact which these two Suttas formally prove is that, like Christianity in
the hands of St. Paul, Buddhism, after the death of its founder,
continued to develope in the hands of his disciples.

   In the Madhura Sutta Kaccâna discusses, as the Buddha had discussed
in other Suttas, the great Indian institution of caste--or '*colour*'
according to the literal translation of the term used for caste alike in
Pâli and in Sanskrit. It is not within the province of this paper to
investigate the evolution of the caste-system from the primary
distinction of colour between the white Aryan invaders and the 'black
men' whom they first encountered in India. By the time that Buddhism
arose, some five centuries before the Christian era, caste was an
accomplished fact; within the Aryan pale, society was more or less
rigidly divided into the four 'classic' castes. Thus in the
Ka.n.nakathâla Sutta (No. 90 of the Majjhima Nikâya) the Buddha is
represented as saying--

> "There are these four castes--kshatriyas, brahmins, vai.syas, and
> .sûdras. Of these four castes, two--the kshatriyas and the
> brahmins--are given precedence, to wit, in salutation, homage,
> obeisance, and due ministry."

   It is important at this point to note that the Pâli Pi.takas, in
specifying the four castes as above, invariably give precedence to the
kshatriyas--the râjanyas of the Vedic hymns. As it may be taken for
certain that, when this 'kingly class' first arose, it was supreme in
Indian society, the Pi.takas preserve the ancient tradition in their
championship of the established precedence of the kshatriyas against the
presumptuous usurpation of the brahmins, and mark the transitional epoch
when the brahmin's claim to pre-eminence, <span id="page_343">p.
343</span> though urged with growing arrogance, had not yet extorted
universal recognition--more particularly from the kshatriyas. There is
an excellent illustration of this in the [Amba.t.tha
Sutta](../../bud/dob/dob-03tx) (No. 3 of the Dîgha Nikâya.md), where the
young brahmin Amba.t.tha denounces the Sakyan kshatriyas as
follows:--"The Sakyan race is fierce, violent, hasty, and long-tongued.
Though they are naught but men of substance, yet they pay no respect,
honour, or reverence to brahmins." And the young brahmin goes on to
complain that he himself had not been treated by them in Kapilavastu
with the respect which he expected. Without attempting to deny the
allegation, the Buddha urges that the Sakyans were at home in their own
city, and that Amba.t.tha had no right to be so angry because no notice
was taken of him. Far more important for our present purpose are
sections 24-28 of the same Amba.t.tha Sutta, which deal with the
treatment accorded by kshatriyas and brahmins respectively to the son
(i.) of a kshatriya youth by a brahmin girl, and (ii.) of brahmin youth
by a kshatriya girl. In reply to the Buddha's series of questions, the
young brahmin is forced to admit that in both cases alike the brahmins
will recognize the hybrid offspring as a full brahmin, whereas the
kshatriyas will not admit to kshatriya rank anyone who is not the child
of kshatriya parents on both sides. "So it is clear," triumphantly
argues the Buddha, "whether you regard it from the male or from the
female side, that it is the kshatriyas who are the best people, and the
brahmins their inferiors." Similarly, the young brahmin is forced to
admit that, if a kshatriya is expelled by his fellows, the brahmins will
welcome him as one of themselves, and he will rank as a full
brahmin;<span class="small"><sup>\[1\]</sup></span> whereas an expelled
brahmin is never received by the kshatriyas. Hence, even when a
kshatriya is in the depths of degradation, still it is true that the
kshatriyas are the best people, and the brahmins their inferiors! Having
got the young brahmin

<span class="small">\[1. This conflicts with Prof. Rhys Davids'
statement (Hibbert Lectures, 1881, p. 24) that at the rise of Buddhism
"no kshatriya could any longer become a brâhman."\]</span>

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

so far in recognizing the lesson taught by the facts of life, the Buddha
clinches the matter with a favourite quotation<span
class="small"><sup>\[1\]</sup></span>:--

 

   "Moreover, it was the Brahmâ<span
class="small"><sup>\[2\]</sup></span> Sana"m-kumâra<span
class="small"><sup>\[3\]</sup></span> who uttered this stanza--

> The kshatriya is best among folk who heed lineage. He who knows and
> acts aright is best among gods and men.

   Now this stanza, Amba.t.tha, was well sung and not ill sung by the
Brahmâ Sana"m-kumâra, well said and not ill said, sensible and not
senseless. I, too, Amba.t.tha, join in saying that the kshatriya is best
among folk who heed lineage," etc.

\[1. It occurs in the Majjhima and Sa"myutta Nikâyas, as well as in the
above passage in the Dîgha.

2\. At page 239 of his *Buddhism*, Bishop Copleston strangely mistakes
Brahmuno for brâhma.nena, and translates "It was a *brahman*"!

3\. In note 14 to page 38 of his *Vish/nu Purá/na* (London, 1840), H. H.
Wilson says:--"The Kaumâra creation is the creation of Rudra or
Nílalohita, a form of Šiva, by Brahmá, which is subsequently described
in our text, and of certain other mind-born sons of Brahmâ, of whose
birth the Vish/nu Purá/na gives no further account: they are elsewhere
termed Sanat-kumára, Sananda, Sanaka, and Sanátana, with sometimes a
fifth, Ribhu, added. These declining to create progeny, remained, as the
name of the first implies *ever boys*, Kumáras: that is, ever pure and
innocent; whence their creation is called the Kaumára. . . And the Linga
has . . . 'Being ever as he was born, he is here called a youth; and
hence his name is well known as Sanat-kumára.'This authority makes
Sanat-kumára and Ribhu the two first born of all; whilst the text of the
Hari Vansa limits the primogeniture to Sanat-kumára. . . . Sanat-kumára
and his brethren are always described in the Saiva Purá/nas as Yogis: as
the Kúrma, after enumerating them, adds: 'These five, oh Brahmans, were
Yogis, who acquired entire exemption from passion'; and the Hari Vansa,
although rather Vaishnava than Saiva, observes that the Yogis celebrate
these six, along with Kapila, in Yoga works."

In Pâli, Sanat-kumára becomes Sana"m-kumâra, still retaining the meaning
of {Greek: *o áei párðenos*}. Buddhaghosa, in his commentary on the
above Pâli text as it occurs in the 63rd Sutta of the Majjhima Nikâya,
says:--"Sana"m-kumâra means 'The maid of yore.' From very ancient days
he has been known as 'the Maid.' Tradition says that, when among men in
the epoch of the Five Little Maids (? = the five mind-born sons of
Brahmâ above), he grew to Insight, and, dying with Insight full and
undimmed, was re-born in the Brahmâ Realm. His old existence was so
sweet and dear to him that it was always in such semblance that he went
about. Therefore, he was known as Sana"m-kumâra."\]

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

   On enquiry of Sanskrit scholars, I have been unable to discover any
trace of this remarkable *gâthâ* in existing Brahminical literature.
Now, it is hardly conceivable that Buddism could have concocted the
verse, and have had the impudence to foist its authorship upon the
venerable personality of Sanat-kumâra; the forgery would have been too
monstrous, and the exposure too certain. On the other hand, with the
growing claims of the brahmins to precedence, so inconvenient an
utterance by so eminent a brahminical authority would naturally tend to
be relegated to oblivion, and so, in course of time, to be dropped
altogether out of the official recension of brahmin texts. But it is to
be hoped that the discovery of the *gâthâ* in Sanskrit may at once
corroborate the Buddha in his favourite quotation, and dispel all *prima
facie* suspicion of brahminical *suppressio veri*.

   The general feeling of Buddhism in favour of kshatriya precedence is
briefly indicated in the statement of Chapter iii. of the *Lalita
Vistara,* which is thus translated by Foucaux:--"Les Bôdhisattvas
naissent certainement dans deux familles, celle des Brahmanes et celle
des Kchattriyas. Quand c'est la famille des Brahmanes qui est respectée,
ils naissent dans une famille de Brahmanes; quand c'est la famille des
Kchattriyas qui est respectée \[yadâ kshatriya-guruko loko bhavati\],
ils naissent dans une famille de Kchattriyas. *Aujourd'hui, réligieux,
la famille des Kchattriyas est respectée, c'est pour cela que les
Bôdhisattvas naissent dans une famille de Kchattriyas*."

   If we pass from social to intellectual rank, it is interesting to
note that--at least, in the Upanishad period, in which Buddhism probably
arose--there was anything but a tendency among the brahmins who composed
the Upanishads to despise the philosophic attainments of the kshatriyas.
In the Upanishads it is the great kshatriya kings who are always
represented as teaching the brahmins Vedânta. And in the Chândogya
Upanishad (of which there is a translation by Professor Max Müller in
vol. i. of the Sacred Books of the East), frequent references are made
to the superior learning of kshatriyas. It is a kshattiya sage <span
id="page_346">p. 346</span> who appears in Book i: 8, 1, silencing the
brahmins, and again in Book v. 3. At the end of Book v. 3, occurs a very
remarkable passage in which Gautama, the father of the Gautama gotra,
who had gone to the court of the King of Pañcâla for instruction in the
knowledge of a future life, is thus addressed by the king:--

   "Since, o Gautama, thou hast thus spoken to me and since this wisdom
never came to the brahmins before thee, therefore among all people (or
in all worlds) to the kshatriya caste alone has this instruction
belonged."<span class="small"><sup>\[1\]</sup></span>

   In the Vâse.t.tha Sutta ([No. 35 of the Sutta
Nipata](../../bud/sbe10/sbe1035.htm#sect_9.md) and No. 98 of the Majjhima
Nikâya) the Buddha appeals to comparative morphology to show that caste
distinctions are unscientific. There are numerous generic and specific
marks distinguishing the several grasses and trees, worms, moths,
beasts, birds, and fishes; but these numerous marks are not found on men
as on all other living creatures; the distinctions between man and man
are individual, not specific or generic. Herein, Gotama was in accord
with the conclusion of modern biologists that "the *Anthropidæ* are
represented by the single genus and species, Man,"--a conclusion which
was the more remarkable inasmuch as the accident of colour did not
mislead Gotama, as it did within living memory the citizens of a free
and enlightened republic.

 

II\.

   So far, this sketch of caste from the Buddhist point of view has been
confined to what the Ka.n.nakathâla Sutta calls *di.t.thadhammika*, i.e.
facts of the visible world. It remains to consider the Pi.taka view of
caste with reference to *samparâyika*, i.e. matters concerning the life
hereafter. On this head the Pi.takas are emphatic in asserting the
irrelevancy of all caste distinctions; the saving

<span class="small">\[1. See also the same legend in the .Satapatha
Brâhma.na.\]</span>

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

Truth was open to attainment by all castes alike in equal degree. Of the
many illustrations which might be adduced to show the worthlessness of
caste in the higher life, one of the most picturesque occurs in the
Ka.n.nakathâla Sutta, and is here given in an English version.

   Says the King to the Buddha: "There are these four castes,
sir--kshatriyas, brahmins, vai.syas, and .sûdras; let us suppose them to
be imbued with the five forms of strenuous exertion to win Release. In
this case would there be any distinction, sir, any difference between
these four castes?"

   "Here too, sire (replies the Buddha), I do not admit any difference
whatsoever between them, that is to say as regards Release compared with
Release. Just as if, sire, a man were to kindle a fire with dry herbs,
and another man were to kindle a fire with dry sal-wood, and a third
were to kindle a fire with dry mango-wood, and a fourth with dry
fig-wood--what think you, sire? Would these divers fires kindled with
divers wood show any difference whatsoever in flame as compared with
flame, in hue as compared with hue, in brightness as compared with
brightness?"

   "No difference at all, sir."

   "Even so, sire, is the inward illumination which is kindled by effort
and nursed by strenuous exertion. I say that there is no difference
whatsoever herein, that is to say in Release as compared with Release."

 

III\.

   The Madhura Sutta, as will be seen *infra*, deals with the caste
system under five heads. It teaches that caste (i.) cannot ensure
material success in life; (ii.) cannot save the wicked from punishment
hereafter; (iii.) cannot debar the good from bliss hereafter; (iv.)
cannot shield evildoers from the criminal law; and (v.) cannot affect
the uniform veneration extended to the *réligieux*, whether he be sprung
from <span id="page_348">p. 348</span> the highest or the lowest of the
four castes. In all these important respects the four castes are exactly
equal.<span class="small"><sup>\[1\]</sup></span> The Madhura Sutta does
not go on to state, nor does any Sutta with which I am acquainted
venture to state, that in every possible respect the four castes were on
one identical footing of equality. Such a statement would have evinced a
certain blindness to facts. For, though in all essentials caste was an
empty name to the Buddha, nevertheless, the distinctions of caste had a
residual sphere of petty activity, and ranked among the 'accidents' of
life. Whilst caste had no part in the higher life (which was alone
worthy or an earnest man's attention), and was irrelevant in the less
trivial of mundane relations, yet there undoubtedly remained a region
where, in the absence of higher qualifications, the hereditary
distinctions of caste were accepted as an appropriate *differentia*
between little men. But into this trivial region Gotama disdained to
enter. He was content to explode the caste theory, without denouncing it
as a formal institution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The MSS. which I have used in settling the Pâli text of the Madhura
Sutta are four in number--two Burmese (B) and two Si"nhalese (S). The
Burmese MSS. are (i.) the Mandalay manuscript (B<sup>m</sup>) taken from
King Theebaw's library, and (ii.) the Phayre manuscript (B<sup>p</sup>),
forming part of the collection of Buddhist texts obtained by Sir A.
Phayre. These two MSS., which are both in the India Office Library, are
from the same original, but B<sup>m</sup> is incomparably superior to
B<sup>p</sup>, not only in calligraphy, but in accuracy and scholarship.
The India Office Library also contains one of the Si"nhalese MSS. which
I have collated, namely, that quoted as S<sup>t</sup>, which is the
Turnour manuscript.

<span class="small">\[1. Bishop Copleston (p. 234) states that "in
Madhura Sutta (Maj. Nik. v. *sic*.) Gotama explains that all castes are
ultimately equal, as the good, of whatever caste, will enjoy the like
reward of their deeds in heaven, and the bad suffer alike in
hell.'\]</span>

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

In collating this with the Copenhagen manuscript in the Si"nhalese
character (S<sup>c</sup>), I was struck with the constant uniformity of
readings of the two MSS., particularly in copyist's blunders and lacunæ.
There can be no doubt that both are copies of a common original, as also
are B<sup>m</sup> and B<sup>p</sup>.

   For the text of Buddhaghosa's Commentary on the Madhura Sutta I have
relied on a single manuscript, in the Si"nhalese character, in my own
possession, which Mrs. Bode has been so good as to transcribe for me. In
the notes to the Sutta the readings of Buddhaghosa in his Commentary are
cited as 'Bu.' In this connection it seems well to repeat the words of
Vilhelm Trenckner, in his preface to vol. i. of the Majjhima Nikâya
(P.T.S. 1888):--"Whenever Buddhaghosa's readings, from his comments upon
them, are unmistakable, they must in my opinion be adopted in spite of
other authorities. His MSS. were at least fifteen centuries older than
ours, and in a first edition we certainly cannot aim at anything higher
than reproducing his text as far as possible."

THE MADHURA SUTTA.

(*Majjhima-Nikâya*, No. 84.)

   Thus have I heard. Once the reverend Mahâ-Kaccâna was dwelling in the
Gundâ-grove at Madhurâ. Now tidings came to King Madhura Avanti-putta
that the Sage Kaccâna was dwelling at Madhurâ, in the Gundâ-grove, and
that regarding that worshipful Kaccâna such was the high repute noised
abroad that it was said of him that he was scholarly, enlightened, sage,
full of learning, eloquent, ready in exposition, and aged as well as an
Arahat, and that it was good to go and see such Arahats as he was. So
King Madhura Avanti-putta ordered his chariots so fair, so fair, to be
made ready; got into his chariot so fair; and passed forth from Madhurâ
with his chariots so fair, so fair, in royal pomp, to visit the reverend
Mahâ-Kaccâna. When he had ridden along in his chariot as far as a
chariot might go, he alighted from his chariot and made his way on foot
to the reverend Mahâ-Kaccâna. When he had come there, he exchanged with
the reverend Mahâ-Kaccâna the greetings and compliments of friendliness
and civility, and sat down beside him. Seated thus, King Madhura
Avanti-putta spoke as follows to the reverend Mahâ-Kaccâna:--"The
brahmins, Kaccâna, say thus,--'the brahmins are the best caste; every
other caste is inferior. The brahmins are the white caste; every other
caste is black. Only the brahmins are pure, not the non-brahmins. The
brahmins are the legitimate sons of Brahmâ, born from his mouth,
Brahmâ-born, Brahmâ-made, heirs of Brahmâ.' What do you say to this,
sire?"

   "It is mere empty words, sire, to give it out among people that 'the
brahmins are the best caste; every other caste is inferior. The brahmins
are the white caste; every other caste is black. Only the brahmins are
pure, not the non-brahmins. The brahmins are the legitimate sons of
Brahmâ, born from his mouth, Brahmâ-born, Brahmâ-made, heirs of Brahmâ.'

   "For the following reason it may be known to be mere empty words to
make that statement.--What do you think of this, sire? If prosperity
attended a kshatriya in the form of property or herds or silver or gold,
could he have another kshatriya who would get up earlier than he, go to
bed later, be zealous in his master's service, study his comfort, and
speak with affection?--Could he have a "brahmin, a vai.sya, and a .sûdra
who would behave similarly?"

   "Yes, he could, Kaccâna."

exactly equal. I perceive no difference, sir, between them herein."

 

V.

   For the following reason also, sire, it may be known to be mere empty
words to make the statement among people <span id="page_365">p.
365</span> that 'the brahmins are the best caste . . . . (*etc. down
to*) . . . heirs of Brahmâ.'--What do you think of this, sire? In the
case of there being a kshatriya who cuts off his hair and beard, dons
the orange robes, and goes forth from home to homelessness; if he
abstains from taking life, abstains from taking what is not given to
him, abstains from lying, eats no rice after noon, leads the higher
life, is a good man, of noble disposition--what would you do to him?"

   "I would greet him with respect, Kaccâna; or rise up to receive him;
or pray him to be seated; or beg him to accept robes, food-alms,
bedding, sick-necessaries, medicines, and other requisites; or would
provide him with the protection, defence, and keeping proper to a holy
man. And why, Kaccâna? Because, sir, he loses his former style of
'kshatriya,' and is accounted naught but 'a holy man.'"

   "What do you think of this, sire? In the case of there being a
brahmin, or a vai.sya, or a .sûdra who acted and behaved like the
foregoing kshatriya, what would you do to him?"

   "I would extend to the .sûdra, too, the same treatment as I would
accord to the kshatriya. And why, Kaccâna? Because, sir, he loses his
former style of '.sûdra,' and is accounted naught but 'a holy man.'"

   "What do you think of this, sire? If the case be so, are these four
castes exactly equal, or not? Or how does it strike you?"

   "Undoubtedly , Kaccâna, if the case be so, I perceive no difference,
sire, between them herein."

   When Mahâ-Kaccâna had finished giving his reasons whereby it might be
known that it was mere empty words to give it out among people that 'the
brahmins are the best caste, every other caste is inferior; the brahmins
are the white caste, every other caste is black; only the brahmins are
pure, not the non-brahmins; the brahmins are legitimate sons of Brahmâ,
born from his mouth, <span id="page_366">p. 366</span> Brahmâ-born,
Brahmâ-made, heirs of Brahmâ,'--King Madhura Avanti-putta spoke thus to
Mahâ-Kaccâna:--

   "Most excellent, Kaccâna, are the words of thy mouth, most excellent!
Just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down, or were to
reveal that which is hidden away, or were to point out the right road to
him who has gone astray, or were to bring a lamp into the darkness so
that those who have eyes can see external forms;--just so, sir, has the
truth been made known to us, in many a figure, by Kaccâna. I, for my
part, betake myself to the blessed Kaccâna as my refuge, to the
Doctrine, and to the Brotherhood. Let the lord Kaccâna accept me as a
lay-disciple, as one who has found his refuge, from this day forth
whilst life shall last."

   "Do not, sire, betake yourself to me as a refuge! Betake yourself to
that Blessed One alone as your refuge, to whom as my refuge I have
betaken myself."

   "But where, Kaccâna, is the Blessed One now dwelling, the worshipful
Very Buddha?"

   "Deceased now, sire, is that Blessed One, the worshipful Very
Buddha."

   "If I could but hear that Blessed One within ten leagues, ten long
leagues would I go to visit that Blessed One, the worshipful Very
Buddha. If I could but hear that Blessed One within twenty leagues,
within thirty leagues, or within forty leagues, or within fifty
leagues--fifty long leagues would I go to visit that Blessed One, the
worshipful Very Buddha. If within a hundred leagues, Kaccâna, I could
but hear that Blessed One, a hundred long leagues would I go to visit
that Blessed One, the worshipful Very Buddha. But now that Blessed One
is deceased, to him, even though deceased, Kaccâna, I betake myself for
refuge, to him and to the Doctrine and to the Brotherhood. Let the lord
Kaccâna accept me as a lay-brother, as one who has found his refuge,
from this day forth whilst life shall last."
