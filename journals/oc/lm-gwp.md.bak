## GOD AND THE WORLD PHYSICAL.

BY LAWRENCE H. MILLS.

   IN closing an article printed in the September number of this
periodical, I mentioned that the differentiation of the Ideal Supreme
Deity from this universe of matter was a pressing necessity in the
course of our endeavor to build up a proper concept of a spiritual God,
but before we advance to such an undertaking, we had better consider a
little more closely what each of the two things may be which we desire
to put into antithesis. And, as implied or said above, we should not
allow any fatuous and effeminate hesitation in the way of morbid
sensibilities to check our progress, throwing us into a state of
incipient mental cataleptic inanimation at the mere introduction of such
a theme, for it is One which should long ago have been a subject taught
at all our infant school-desks.

   At least we should not balk this point, but advance upon the
principle that the commonest of all structural mechanical facts should
not be blinked, for ignorance cannot much longer continue to be the
source of undeviating satisfaction. We have then nature's universe on
the one side (with mathematics) and on the other our Supreme Ideal
Faith-God with His cognate ideal system.

   These then are our theme for analytical discrimination. What then is
this our mechanic world-all which we should meet with line and plummet,
compass and lens, theodolite, etc.?—that is to say, if we are to examine
it with anything approaching to sincerity. For, first of all, it seems
actually to be necessary to mention such an item as that such a physical
world as ours is not "infinite." One would have thought that most people
who believe that there is anything physical anywhere were convinced that
it could be limited at least as regards dimensions. For the physical
universe, in the name or "measure," is generally supposed to be at least
in space, while its place there is a more serious problem. Space is in
itself, as we generally understand it, simple unoccupied "nothing" for
objects <span id="page_217">p. 217</span> to stand or move in, which
objects in their relative distance from one another, or approximation to
each other, alone fix its limits, those of space. In these spacial
particulars it, the universe, is therefore, like most other things in a
conceivable material world-system, not at all mysterious, any more so
than a pebble or a microbe. It is simply, as said, an object rolling in
nothing, not imaginably related by measure to others similarly situated,
and no more unlimited than any architectural structure. The mental
universe we might add,—so, imperfectly, to speak of it for a moment
without too much precision,—may, on the other hand, and in one sense of
it, be indeed said to be not "bounded" as to space, for, as in the case
of number, the mind can never stop; it goes on irrecoverably beyond to a
figure still more remote, after having already reached what seemed at
first to be things unimaginable,—so, as to space, the mind goes ever out
beyond an almost ultimate conception of nothing, ever on to a still
further emptiness.

   The material All-world, however, while neat-cut as a diamond as to
"space," must yet be, as a whole, entirely unmeasured and immeasurable
as regards "time"; though its particularly teeming life in its
everlasting change-motion is of course all that makes up "time" itself.
Causal thought demands seeming fresh origination every instant for each
such myriad-phase of passing matter-form, but common sight soon shows us
that the substance itself of the particles, of which the almost
immeasurable minute and multitudinous passing facts are the fleeting
shapes, cannot itself be moved;—the atomic electron-particles simply
change position; see above and below. Not fire, flood, nor earthquake
diminish its weight by a kilogram; do ashes, smoke and gas weigh heavier
than the ignited wood, consumed coal, or spirit? See the oxygen and
hydrogen separated by electricity in our experimenting machines,—they
combine again to equal weight. Let me not be misunderstood: I block no
causes nor beginnings; beginnings there are, as said, and by the myriad
at every instant. "All is flow" with Hegel's originals, as with himself;
and precious are all things just in proportion as that flow is strong
and rapid.

   Life is firmer, for it is the flow that makes it; see the pulse or
rather feel it. Yes, there are changes, as beginnings rushing on at
every fraction of a second, but the everlasting substance in which the
change takes place is itself in its elements unalterable. How can a
change take place without something which changes, and which only
changes so far as the changes noted are concerned? If there were no
solid basis, the motion could not exist, nor be maintained— <span
id="page_218">p. 218</span> the elemental substratum
is—inadequately—like the deep sea, "motionless." Change, which is its
manifestation, is the splendid surge. The water particles rest still, or
move but vertically;—it is the wave-form that rushes on the sea or
wheat-field. So also thought-form itself, the life-spark of sentient
nature;—it cannot stop. Mind-organism on organism reaches mature status
and cerebral action at once inevitably sets in. It is the mere motion of
thought faculties; thought-particles;—the thought-muscles alone rest in
sleep, if then. The brain cerebrates, whether normally or not, at
advancing stages. Take our common human puberty as a sample,—a
seed-thought time it is for most of us. See it at the soul's
awaking;—"conversion," we used to call it,—blessed crisis that it was.
We then broke forth into reason's consciousness,—we were veritably "born
again." Right was our deity; the strident will seemed fiercely free, to
have it out with our highest yearnings,—this, passionately. Negation
seemed cowardice; to do some noble thing, or many, was our point. We
took our lives lightly in our hands; we gripped to do or die; we would
even violently force idlers to take part. But what were we here again,
but the fine poise of nature's sentient forces; her better ones?
Injustice seemed the kernel of all woe (all hell) to us,—its center;—but
behold truth was everywhere, half-consciously.

   If the bird be fragile, she can yet rise on wing and be in a moment
safe; if the farm laborer bends to toil, he still smells the sweet earth
and breathes the life-giving air; if the tigress is long starving, she
yet enjoys her fierce spring the more, and the satisfaction of a fuller
meal; if the inventor wrestles with hell's influences in the frightful
fights of jealousy, he has yet at times the thrill of victory; if Dives
is his life-long assailed by a million demons tugging for his all, he
has still at moments the satisfaction of his wishes. There is
(imperfect) balance everywhere,—the essence of what we so fondly try to
call the "truth." Equity means evenness (see gravitation, which is
analogous to stability, compactness). It is however never perfect, but
attempted everywhere—sometimes in terrific forms. Two monsters meet in
duel;—the horn of one snaps like a pipe-stem;—each battles, so he
thinks, and thinks rightly, for some vital interest. Two stags struggle
on a precipice;—antlers are interlocked;—the does look on. The youth
knows that he feels conscience, as much as this;—nay more. And so of
that active right-form, the affections, with their obedience;—he, our
youth, longs on principle, as on passion, to follow them,—but the very
doves do too, dying if parted, of their sorrow. See the wild-fowl's
<span id="page_219">p. 219</span> motherhood;—she will draw the gunner
off, feigning herself wounded, drooping her bedraggled wings, on ever
further from her nest, saving her half-hatched brood. Look at the common
poultry of the barn-door;—they even attracted the attention of our Lord.
See too a keen bitch with her litter; she shows her sharp teeth at
once;—devotion is a part of nature;—"attraction as the square of the
distance";<span id="page_219_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_219_note_1.md) see above.

   And what is order<span id="page_219_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_219_note_2.md) but a something akin to
chemical distribution; like crystallization; see above. The chief bull
leads the herd;—look at the ants again. Order is everywhere (attempted),
and so is genius. The very mould of the world seems to out-fold itself
of itself;—see the chrysalis;—the butterfly's cast is there. Look at the
physical perfection of a new-born human being;—every little nail is in
its place. In fact all sentient and all non-sentient being is there in
motion toward an ideal, infernal or sublime. Even in the fused condition
this was so;—change-phenomenon lived on in the electron in spite of
flames;—forms predestined and pre-existing, appeared everywhere, as
globe on globe grew cool. All the poles first chilled slowly,—then
half-way down they grew more temperate till at last the equators
themselves became possible, just as the globes themselves contracted
from their still prior fire-mists,—and everywhere, as of dire necessity,
as the heat went off, life swarmed, and with it consciousness, terrific
or benign. So our self-life; all was struggling right, love, order and
motion everywhere, with intermittent defeat or victory through murder,
sneak, etc. But where did it all come from?—this all-creative motion—for
none of us who have left our cradles interpose a preternatural creative
interference precisely here;—we, all of us, insert that miracle at a
long distance, indefinitely further back. All is as yet "sequence," with
us, in the common causal-chain; it is shape-form, ever changing in the
everlasting unchanging substance—substratum. But suddenly, in these our
well-fed meanderings on facts so patent, a keen thought shoots through
us like a pang;—why in such an hypothetically conceived-of *almost*
perfect physical system, balanced so symmetrically,—why do we need any
quasi-natural creative interference ever, anywhere, or at all? "In the
beginning God created the heavens and the earth" is an absolute mystery
which we must accept in childlike ignorance and faith. We have no right
at all to exercise our intellectual faculties upon it, but we have
likewise no right to stop our mental existence for this or any other
cause. God has given us our sanity, <span id="page_220">p. 220</span>
and we must use it. We proceed to trace the facts and check a
quasi-creationism.

   *Caloric does not imperatively call for it*. All nature's things once
flamed, so far as we can dream of it,—once, at least, so on this our
sidereal ball,—with its planet-mates. It surely once passed through
fire, as now all clearly see. All was included in that mass of burnt
nature which once was this rolling sphere. Out of these seething
substances, once vapor, then fluid, then fiery sands and stones and
metals, came all things here terrestrial,—as few now doubt,—for all were
already there without exception. The evolving and revolving masses
became slowly dense; vapor thickened to liquid, liquid to solid, till
the well-formed continents appeared between the oceans, with hot rivers
rushing in their own midsts themselves. And out of this all came the
great souls of earth as well as the villains, counterfeits and
knaves;—and with them the now forever forgotten millions upon millions
of other sentient being who have emerged from the same elements, came
also to their apex, some of them, and perished, having vibrated to some
partial measure at least, all of them, with the same yearnings,
emotions, fears and hopes in the long æons of a past formative eternity;
and this in endless iterations, catenations. Oh, no! we raise no voice
to deny that thing "beginning"—far from it; God forbid;—see everywhere
above. Beginnings rushed on, are rushing now, and will forever fly at
more than electric speed;—it is only the affixed particle to the great
word with which we quarrel. "Beginnings" there are, as we cannot too
frequently accede, and by the million,—myriads at every instant pressing
on,—so ever throughout all,—but they are but the rushings-on of *eternal
form-change*—not one single one of the vast finitude was ever for a
moment *absolute as an ultimate,* or primal, original in any sense at
all,—not for an instant. Like the chants to God in the Gāthic faith they
"had no first";—all was fleeting "form-change" of an abiding substratum,
eternal in its sequence, forth and back. So only or, rather, so
really,—for there is nothing greater than a form-change, we must not
snub it,—substance's eternally proceeding externals it is—mighty indeed.
So they are with crashing cataclysms in smiles of beauty, or frowns of
horror. Differences there are in them, somewhat great;—slime and a solar
system are not so close alike;—see a fetish and a Phidias. The ever
furious fresh form-changes glide, or crash, on with standing speed
(sic), and in that motion all sentient life-forces have their being,—but
from the first ever imagined slightest jar, not to say "recorded," to
those awful motions now passing at this present instant, not one <span
id="page_221">p. 221</span> solitary one has been without conditions, so
not one ever for an instant absolute or preternatural;—incessant is the
change. No, elemental absolute beginning is not thinkable. For how, as
said, can a thing begin out of nothing? *Beginning phenomenal* has of
itself reference to time, *beginning absolute* belongs to eternity, and
not to nature-motion, nor to its measure;—least of all could a sidereal
member of our solar group begin—in nature; that is to say, not
absolutely. It is not dreamable; that is, not without miracle; and
miracle is not our subject here; see on below. Creation-miracle would
indeed be *beginning elemental*,—but it would be, like accident, *out of
nature*; a break in the unbreakable chain-circle of all phenomena, while
a missing link is here fatuity. Intellection deals alone with nature in
its unbroken chain;—miracle, creation, accident lie in an entirely
different category,—in the same ideal system with the Ideal God, not in
nature, but in supernature, and there they are quite as possible,
ideally, as He is. They are faith-objects, but our languages can ill
express the idea here, for language is objective. These then are the two
things to differentiate, if we wish to render an account for the use of
our supposed full sanity. Conscience here should interpose one twinge at
least for an honest "plumb" for once, and it is a very bad sacrilege
indeed for us to fatuate our faculties. The nature-universe is simply
permanent (Herakleitos);—things are and always were,—and after every
effort to bring a thing to nothing, we find that we can only change its
phase.

   It has become at the present time a vital necessity to defend all
cherished opinions upon subjects of prominent religious importance, and
with the utmost regard to truth and reason. To assert a great spiritual
principle and then to refuse altogether to discuss it, is no longer to
be regarded as being either safe or honest. I have myself lately
endeavored to advance here upon these better lines, and with little
hesitation, for I have even applied scrutiny to the very doctrine of
creation itself. The miraculous element in this representation as
recorded in the first chapter of Genesis is sentimentally dear to every
one of us, but the only way to preserve it is to face its difficulties
without recoil. And, first of all, it is obviously vital to separate the
ideal of creation as a miracle from the never ceasing activities of
nature in its continuous chain of cause and effect.

   My explanation is that the creation of the world, in perhaps a
certain rhetorical sense of it, is now still progressing and at every
divisible moment of time. As the course of history is the "day of
judgment," so that course is its hours of divine origination. My
inconsistency is of course obvious. It was once thought by earnest <span
id="page_222">p. 222</span> men that a natural creation in the ordinary
sense of the word was needed in the light of pure reason. How could the
physical world, it was asked, have originated of itself, and devout men
simply welcomed the first chapter of Genesis, and that almost as a
scientific explanation.

   It was a miraculous act of creation of the world out of nothing, so
they thought. Or, granted an eternity of the raw matter, it was at least
the miraculous interference of an artificer (there wasn't much
difference)—to this of course I adhere, so far as we must accept a
supernatural world-maker. Of course there was fallacy in the truism of
the supposed pious rationalist, when he asserted that something could
not come out of nothing,—a fact which no one ever denied. Indeed in the
light of mere logic he was right, for God Himself is as much an entity,
or a "thing" as any other object, if He be an object. How then did He
Himself arise, was only a fair question, to which the pious disputant of
course answered that He did not arise at all. To this the sceptic might
have rejoined, "If you say that God did not arise at all, why could you
not also say that nature had no arising, either as regards its matter or
its laws?" There would be nothing whatsoever profane in such a remark,
for it merely concerns time. It is not profane to say that nature now
exists; why should it be wrong to say that it existed for untold
millions of ages gone by, as all now agree? Why then should it not have
existed forever, and where is the blasphemy? Obviously this would rob
God of the glory of a mechanical achievement,—but would that be so gross
a deprivation? To say that the physical world, not the universe, is the
production of God's natural creative function might in some lights of it
be hardly regarded as a *compliment*. See on the Zoroastrian Dualism. At
all events I venture to propose as above, that God is in the world,
physically, supernaturally, as eternally and miraculously active in it
at every instant, and this is and was the "creation." But why, asks the
worshiper, was it so written in Genesis I, if there were really no
beginning? The answer is obvious. Such a statement is misleading. There
was ever so much of a beginning, that is to say, as regards our human
race. The ideal God, in His omniscient wisdom, foresaw all the future as
He remembered all the past; or rather, at every moment He was conscious
of both. If "not a sparrow falls to the ground without Him," surely the
incipience of the human race, however degraded it was destined to be and
to continue, was no matter of indifference to Him, for it (the human
race) has its good points as well as its evil ones. So that the
"creation" of Genesis I was indeed <span id="page_223">p. 223</span> an
epoch in God's eternity, but it had simply reference *to us*. See above.
Otherwise it was but a mere dot in His unlimited experience.

   My only explanation of my suggestion that God is now creating the
world is that this is all "ideal"; but as to what "ideal" really means,
I am not at present prepared to say. See Kant's doctrine of the ideas.
Certainly ideas are actually things, as much so as the mountain ranges,
but I will not now discriminate. I only say that to be serious we must
separate all natural process from all miracle, and above all from
creative miracle, which indeed the doctrine of miracle demands of
itself. I do not think it can do harm to dwell on this for a moment. The
course of the physical world must be traced back to eternity, if that be
possible, just as it must be traced back to the last fifty years or
anticipated for the next future half-century, and to say the contrary is
either fatuity or fraud.
