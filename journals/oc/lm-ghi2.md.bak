## GOD AND HIS IMMORTALS: THEIR COUNTERPARTS.<span id="page_164_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_164_note_1.md)

<span class="small">BY LAWRENCE HEYWORTH MILLS.</span>

 

   BUT the Opposer intervenes;—for, as against the supreme
Life-Spirit-Lord, with His six characteristics, and in the pervading
antithesis of the system the great Antagonistic Being, Angra
Mainyu,<span id="page_164_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_164_note_2.md) the Evil Spirit,
appears, and stands in great prominence as perhaps the most defined
concept of the kind ever advanced in all well-known theology. He is the
Creator of all that is averse to the Good.

   His attributes are not as yet at all so closely summarized in the
Gathas as those of Ahura are, nor are they indeed formally collected
even in the later but still genuine Avesta. They are however yet both
implicitly and explicitly present in the Gatha as in the later Avesta,
and with incisive force throughout.

   Asha, the holy rhythm of fidelity in God and nature, first<span
id="page_164_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_164_note_3.md) of the sacred and august
six Attributes just above discussed,<span
id="page_164_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_164_note_4.md) is met at every turn by
its contradictory opposite, manifested, as might be expected, in the
sinister shifts of subterfuge.

   Jealousy, that first recognized of all the loathsome instincts in
Bible, Veda, Iliad, and our Avesta, sheds its green gleam over the form
of truthful innocence with the natural results at once apparent, the
young, like Abel, in their first truthfulness are everywhere betrayed.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

   Suspicion, alas too often justified, is sown throughout. Treachery,
as we even see it now, more and more pervaded intercourse, till Ferocity
abode its time.

   Murder was the mere outspoken expression of it all, led off, as might
be expected, by the offspring of the first human pair (see Genesis); or
later on in a finer garb as wreathed in the glare of a madman's joy it
appeared in the hour of long planned infamy, the assassin gloating over
his victim. Every uncanny desire was more than satisfied. Surely this is
a very sinister side of existence—of the privilege of consciousness
itself, and the first thought which brought on these delineations, is
the Lie of the sneaking sycophant, the Druj, She-Devil, first daughter
of the king Dushahu.

   Then comes, less sickening, but still revolting, the Akem Manah. It
or "he," stands out as against Vohumanah; as the Druj stands out against
Asha; and we may well term it Hate, the concentration of woe's passions,
as the Druj was their inception—the continued forth-action of the doomed
nature. As the mother in the love of Vohu Manah yearns after her little
second self, her transmitted soul, so the Akem Manah, blind Fury of
Aeshma, stands ready to destroy it. Fair youths, each moved with noblest
instincts, still meet in murderous conflict, and fathers mourn their
life's lost hopes;—for what? Wars hated by mothers still wrap whole
continents in flames, as blight wipes away wide provinces of ripening
food. Famine falls upon the world's most simple living inhabitants.

   Pestilence strikes terror where it does not more mercifully, swiftly
kill—while frightful nightmares of futurity cloud the early days of the
thoughtful child, diverting at times even the strong man's life to
worthless channels later on, and the dying sometimes await with benumbed
conviction the frights of certain Hell, merciful Nature deadening the
otherwise tortured faculties. It is the Akem Manah, "the Evil plan" as
we might almost term it, preferring also perhaps the other form of the
adjective, the superlative *achishtem*;—not the "evil" only but the
"*Worst*" Mind;—and this, always according to the analogies worked out
through implication, is what murderously conflicted with our Vohu Manah
everywhere—poisoning the thoughts of that blessed instinct of
"Good-Will." And as against God's Authority Khshathra, benignant and
merciful, restraining only to compact, ameliorate and save, we have the
overwhelming despots of Dush Khshathra. Government, meant to be the arm
of truth and God's right hand, and raised aloft for good to repress the
outbursting impulses of the young, to protect the wronged,—and punish
the agents of the Akem Manah, is met by <span id="page_166">p.
166</span> the Evil Power. At times, even affected with uncontrolled
cerebral mania,—the half mad imbeciles of despotism, that is of
"inverted power," wreak vengeance on the innocent for their existence
and their excellence, taking from their children's lips the bread of
sustenance. Those who save their country by great deeds must be prepared
for simple murder. Hard earned results stored carefully for an evil day
are snatched off in a moment;—slaves must see their labor's wage paid to
their masters, with gross indulgence for their recompense. Justice must
be laughed at and the silliest of untruths laboriously propagated.

   Or, again, wild chaos must sweep everything in the poor hopeless
efforts at reform,—too much force being less fatal than too little.
Tyranny in the form of Anarchy leaves misery redoubled. The helpless
blinded lead on the poorer blind. Indiscipline, false liberty, leaves
all things lost.—Such was the Dush-Khshathra, essence of the impulses
which lived in the tyrants of the Yasna.

   And then for Aramaiti, God's self-moved inspiration in the good,
there was Taramaiti,—the Insolence Irrepressible, bold genius of
effrontery. It was by implication and from the analogies active like the
Aramaiti, and it gloried in its shame. It was what makes a mock of piety
shouting its wild chorus in ribald chants to infamy; it was the
wantonness of the Lie, the Hate, the Tyranny, while blatant.

   We know such things too plainly—they are the shrieks from our
madhouse windows, the travestied hymns of midnight streets, the crime of
those who "draw iniquity with a cord of vanity, and sin as it were with
a cart rope." And there is then its fell result—the very *Completeness*,
Haurvatat, of the Holy God has, on this doctrine its awful negative. The
Supreme (?) Deity faces a territory which He Himself has never trod,
while His adversary has his emissaries everywhere within His own
dominions—with the result that all is approximately marred. Disease, to
state the first cursed evil now suggested here, stands ready in a
thousand forms to terrify as well as ruin. That one firm work of God,
the blest balance of the bodily and mental powers which we call Health,
sole condition of effective normal action, is jeoparded.

   Demoniac laughter greets foul evils worse than leprosy; poisons which
revolt the touch and nostril are lightly passed along; the dying agonies
of helpless hearts are made the call for roars of approbation, while to
the good, a sorrow well-nigh intensified to mania at times settles over
everything; the wine cup with its lighter ruin has given place to the
scorching flame of the spirit poison put to the <span id="page_167">p.
167</span> lips of the helpless poor, while the cyclone of financial
panic sweeps over the face of populations white with terror, like the
face of Ocean swept white with hurricanes, wrecking homes forever;—the
treason of some thieving fiend fills up the cup, turning the household
to the streets, capped by the remorse of the silly victim, trusting the
man hyena with his all.

   Haurvatat, the blessed Real of the Ideal, is indeed met by an
Incompleteness which has made us almost doubt whether the Evil One of
the Two Colossi has not indeed sometimes had the upper hand; and whether
life itself be not the curse of all of us.

   And as against the Immortal Being of our God the Life Spirit Lord,
and that of His saints in Earth and Heaven there was, and is, the ever
dread alternative;—as seen above.<span
id="page_167_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_167_note_5.md)

   Even where we are awake to see in Her, nature's soft second nurse,
the sweet ending of a life well spent, a fight well fought,—yet, how we
recoil—poor self-blinded human nature that we are—aye, how we recoil
even from that calm non-entity from which we came. Then what Death is
not to the dying, it is alas that redoubled to the bereaved: to miss the
beloved form; to see the dear face fade away—here agonies are real
indeed; and the end though it be not indeed the King of terrors, yet it
is verily the Queen of sorrows,—*indomitæque morti!*

   Such are the Six Attributes of the Antagonistic Being—extracted by
ourselves from the course of Gathic thought.—The deeper Searcher, let me
say it here in passing,—who is more anxiously scrutinizing the interior
psychic forces here present, will be gratified to see our one main point
here strengthened. These Attributes—let us note it well in passing—are
still only one of them at all with certainty *personified*; and, as said
above, they are nowhere gathered like the Holy Seven; and this points
that most incisive of phenomena, the strange deep abstract nature of the
Six, for if five of the six corresponding qualities of Angra Mainyu
gathered by ourselves from the antitheses of the Gatha are thus so
obviously abstact, this strong fact goes to make out the abstractness of
our collected six beatifications all the more distinctly; and it is on
this that momentous issues of the past once hung. Yet the two chief ones
of each of the Seven, I mean Ahura and Angra Mainyu—are here personified
beyond all manner of a doubt, God as Ahura Mazda, with His fell
opponent. It might be considered strange indeed that I should for one
moment mention such a thing so obvious; but here I must be thorough and
exhaustive in a certain light of it. Some <span id="page_168">p.
168</span> of my readers will doubtless understand why I dwell on such
an apparently all-obvious item. They are indeed great conscious beings
personified, and beyond all doubt of it the first ever so presented in
all history; and we should pause here to recall and gather up all that
this great fact has in it.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_164">p. 164</span>

<span id="page_164_note_1"></span>[1](#page_164_fr_1.md) This is a
continuation of Professor Mills's article "[God and His
Immortals](lm-ghi1.md)," which appeared in the January Number of *The Open
Court*.

<span id="page_164_note_2"></span>[2](#page_164_fr_2.md) Literally the
"Torturing Spirit" from the idea of "tortion," but the literal ideas of
etymology are seldom to be followed closely in defining the particular
meanings of a word. Simply "evil" is the sense.

<span id="page_164_note_3"></span>[3](#page_164_fr_3.md) So in the original
documents,—the Gathas; Asha leads us to its interior force and meaning.
Not so later; Vohu Manah gained the prior place, doubtless, from its
pleasing significance.
