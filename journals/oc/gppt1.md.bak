## GOSPEL PARALLELS FROM PÂLI TEXTS.

<span class="small">Translated from the originals by ALBERT J.
EDMUNDS.</span>

 

   I GAVE some facts about the pre-Christian antiquity of the Pâli Texts
in a [note](cabgb.htm#page_701.md) in *The Open Court* for November, 1898.
The question of Hindû ideas reaching Palestine is still on its trial.
The interchange of thought between Greece and India was part of the
programme of Alexander, who took Greek artists on his Eastern
expedition. When his successors at Alexandria began translating the Old
Testament, they were carrying out his cosmic plan. Diadorus of Sicily
states this plan:

   "\[Alexander decreed\] that there should be interchanges between
cities, and that people should be transferred out of Asia into Europe,
and conversely out of Europe into Asia, to the end that the two great
continents, by intermarriages and exchange of good offices, might become
homogeneous and established in mutual friendship." (*Diod. Sic.* XVIII.
4).

   The Alexandrian librarian pointed out to Ptolemy the lore of the
Hindûs and others, while the court of Antioch set Berosus to translate
the records of the Babylonians. The Old Testament was already in
progress. Now, while the Greeks were thus translating the Sacred Books
of the East, twenty-one centuries before Max Müller, Asoko was sending
Buddhist missionaries into their empire. Why should not these two
outreachings have met? Asoko boasts that his mission made headway. Even
though the Buddhist oracles were still oral, they can have left traces
among ascetics in Palestine and Egypt. The origin of the Essenes is
still a mystery; but the semi-Christian Elkesaites, according to
Hippolytus, came "from Seres of Parthia," i.e. Buddhists. Hippolytus
also tells us that the Docetæ taught that Christ came to abolish
transmigration. Now, Gotamo says, on the first page of the *Itivuttaka*,
the Buddhist Logia-Book: "I am your surety against return to earth."

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

   Joseph Jacobs has shown that Hindû fairy-tales were known in
Palestine in the first century, and the Jâtaka stories represent their
hero as being educated at Taxila, the centre of Indo-Greek learning.
*The Questions of King Milindo* exhibit Buddhist schools of reciters, at
the time of the Christian era, keeping up the sacred lore, which was
enquired into by intelligent Greeks.

   In the Book of Discipline, Gotamo predicts that his religion will
last for five hundred years. Now these figures have been altered to five
thousand in uncanonical works written after the time of Christ, i.e.
after the five hundred years had expired. Therefore, the Book of
Discipline would appear to have been untampered with since that date;
and the Canon may well have been put into its written form about 90
B.C., as the Ceylon Chronicles state.

   These remarks are the summary of an essay, giving full references,
the result of years of research. No borrowing is alleged on either
side--Christian or Buddhist--in these Parallels. We offer no theory, but
present them as facts. They at least belong to a world of thought which
the whole East had in common.

 

<span id="pp_1"></span>{1} THE CHRIST REMAINS \[ON EARTH\] FOR THE ÆON.

<span class="small">[John xii. 34](../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#12:34.md). Udâna
VI. 1; and Book of the Great Decease, p. 23. (Translated in [S. B. E.
XI. p. 40](../../bud/sbe11/sbe1103.htm#page_40).md).</span>

   \[This is not a New Testament doctrine, but a current belief at the
time of Christ. Commentators have been at a loss to identify he Old
Testament passage which is supposed to be quoted. *The Twentieth Century
New Testament* proposes the Aramaic version of [Isaiah ix.
7](../../bib/kjv/isa.htm#9:7.md) as the source. Be that as it may, we have
here a verbal Pâli parallel.\]

   Ânando, any one who has practised the four mystical
methods--developed them, made them a vehicle and an aim, pursued them,
accumulated, and striven to the height thereof,--can, if he so should
wish, *remain* \[on earth\] *for an æon* or the rest of an æon. Now,
Ânando, the Tathâgato has practised and perfected these; and if he so
should wish, *the Tathâgato could remain* \[on earth\] *for an æon* or
the rest of the æon.

   \[The words in italics agree with those in the Greek of John, except
the mood and tense of the verb. Rendel Harris has pointed out to me that
the tense of {Greek: *menei*} is ambiguous, being either present or
future. This is because the manuscripts are without accents. *Tathâgato*
is a religious title equivalent to Christ. lts exact meaning is
doubtful.\]

<span id="pp_2"></span>{2} FEW THAT ARE SAVED.

<span class="small">[Matth. vii. 13, 14](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#7:13.md);
[Luke xiii 23, 24](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#13:23.md). A"nguttara Nikâyo I. 19
(Not before translated).</span>

   Monks! just as, in this India, there are only a few pleasant parks,
groves, landscapes, and lotus-ponds, but far more of broken ground,
impassable rivers, tree-stumps, thorny roads, and rugged rocks: so also,
monks! there are few beings who, when vanished from the human, are born
again among humans; but far more who, when vanished from the human, are
born again in hell, in the wombs of brutes or the haunt of ghosts; few
who are born among the angels, more who are born as I have said. And
there are few beings, O monks! who, when vanished from the angelic, are
born again among angels, but far more who vanish from the angelic to be
born again in hell, in the wombs of brutes or the haunt of ghosts.

 

<span id="pp_3"></span>{3} ASCENSION.

<span class="small">Udâna VIII. 9. (Not before translated).</span>

   \[This story is more analogous to the ascension of Elijah in the
Second Book of Kings than to that of Christ, as related in the first
chapter of Acts. There is no account of the Ascension in the Synoptical
Gospels, except a single line in [Luke xxiv.
51](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#24:51.md),<span
id="page_116_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_116_note_1.md) while the Mark Appendix
is a later addition. John refers to the Ascension as a spiritual fact;
so does Paul; but the only pictorial account is that of Acts. In the
Pâli legend, the hero is Dabbo the Mallian, a disciple of Buddha's who
had extraordinary psychical powers. The Book of Discipline tells us that
he was able to light the monks to bed by emitting magnetic flames from
his fingers. See Sacred Books of the East, Vol. XX., p. 7.\]

   Thus have I heard. At one season the Blessed One was staying in the
Bamboo Grove beside the Squirrels' feeding-ground, at Râjagaha. And the
venerable Dabbo the Mallian approached the Blessed One, saluted him and
sat on one side, and so sitting, said to him: "O Auspicious One, my time
is at hand to enter Nirvâ.na."<span
id="page_116_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_116_note_2.md)--"Whatever you think
fit, O Dabbo."--Then the venerable Dabbo the Mallian rose from his seat,
saluted the Blessed One, and keeping on his right hand, went up into the
sky, and sat in the posture of meditation in the ether, in the empyrean.
Intensely meditating on the nature of flame, he ascended and passed into
Nirvâ.na.

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

   And when the venerable Dabbo the Mallian had thus gone up, meditated
and ascended, there remained neither ashes nor soot of his body when
passed away,<span id="page_117_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_117_note_1.md) consumed and burnt. Even
as, when ghee or oil is consumed and burnt, neither ashes nor soot
remains, so was it with the body of the venerable Dabbo the Mallian. And
forthwith the Blessed One, having understood the fact, gave vent on that
occasion to the following Udâna:

   "The body dissolved, perception ceased, all sensations were utterly
consumed;

   "The constituents of existence were stilled, consciousness and sense
departed."

 

<span id="pp_4"></span>{4} SUPERNATURAL BIRTH.

<span class="small">[Luke i. 35](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#1:35.md). Majjhima
Nikâyo, Sutta 38. Quoted in *The Questions of King Milindo*, p. 123, but
*not* translated in S. B. E. XXXV.</span>

   Conception takes place, O monks, by the union of three. In this world
the father and the mother are united. The mother may be capable, but the
genius (*gandhabbo*, Sanskrit *gandharva*), may not be ready. It is by
the union of these three, O monks, that conception takes place.

   \[Neumann, in his German translation, expands the text here, perhaps
from the commentary.\]

 

<span id="pp_5"></span>{5} THE SAVIOUR IS UNIQUE.

<span class="small">[John i. 14](../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#1:14.md) and 18
("only begotten";) [Hebrew ix. 26](../../bib/kjv/heb.htm#9:26.md) ("once,
at the end of the ages.") A"nguttara Nikâyo I. 15.</span>

   It is unlikely and impossible, O monks, for two Arahats who are
perfect Buddhas to arise simultaneously in the same world-system: this
is not likely. But it is likely, O monks, for one Arahat who is a
perfect Buddha, to arise in one world-system: this is quite likely.

   \[A similar statement is made of an emperor;<span
id="page_117_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_117_note_2.md) and then it is denied
that a woman can be a Buddha, an emperor--strangely contradicted by
fact--a Sakko, a Mâro, or a Brahmâ.\]

 

<span id="pp_6"></span>{6} SAVING FAITH IN THE LORD.

<span class="small">[Luke xxiii. 42, 43](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#23:42.md).
Majjhima Nikâyo, Sutta 22.</span>

   Thus, O monks, is the Doctrine well taught by me--plain, patent,
clear, and with the old cloth cut away.<span
id="page_117_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_117_note_3.md) Seeing, O monks, <span
id="page_118">p. 118</span> that the Doctrine is thus well taught
\[etc.\], all those who have merely faith and love toward me are sure of
Paradise hereafter.

 

<span id="pp_7"></span>{7} HE WHO SEES THE TRUTH SEES THE LORD.

<span class="small">[John xiv. 6](../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#14:6.md) and 9.  
Itivuttaka 92.</span>

   O monks, even if a monk should gather up the folds of his rob and
follow behind me, treading in my footsteps, yet if he be covetous, on
lusts intent, bad-hearted, corrupt in his mind's aspiration, heedless,
mindless, ill-conducted, with heart confused and unripe faculties, then
is he far from me, and I from him. And why? Because, O monks, that monk
sees not the Doctrine; and he who sees not the Doctrine sees not me. But
if that monk should dwell an hundred leagues away, O monks, and be not
covetous, nor intent on lusts, not bad-hearted nor corrupt in his mind's
aspiration, but heedful, mindful, well-conducted, with concentrated
heart and faculties restrained, then is he near to me, and I to him. And
why? Because, O monks, that monk sees the Doctrine; and HE WHO SEES THE
DOCTRINE SEES ME.

   \[The word *Doctrine* is the ubiquitous *Dhammo*, Sanskrit *Dharma*;
and can be equally well translanted *Truth* or *Religion*.\]

<span id="page_116_note_1"></span>[1](#page_116_fr_1.md). The doubt thrown
upon this line in the margin of the Revised Version of 1881 was
dispelled when the Sinai Syriac was found.

Nirvâ.na*, as above. It is a special word, only used for the death of an
Arahat.

<span id="page_117_note_2"></span>[2](#page_117_fr_2.md). I was interested
to learn lately from the lips of a Hindu that the ancient title

India.
