## THE GOSPEL SOURCE Q.

   <span class="small">\[Professor Wellhausen has discovered that both
Matthew and Luke have used in addition to the Gospel of Mark another
source (*Quelle*) which he designates by the initial Q, a name which has
been generally adopted by theologians. The reconstruction here presented
is according to Harnack.</span>

   <span class="small">The numbers which appear at the beginning of each
fragment are the designations by which they are now referred to in
theological literature. They follow upon the whole the order of
Luke.\]</span>

([Matt. iii. 5](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#3:5.md), 7-12; [Luke iii.
3](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#3:3), 7-9, 16-17..md)

   (When from all the region around Jordan John saw many \[or: the
multitudes\] coming to baptism, he said unto them): O generation of
vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth
therefore fruits meet for repentance; and think not \[begin not\] to say
within yourselves: We have Abraham to our father, for I say unto you
that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. And
now the axe is laid unto the root of the trees; therefore every tree
which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.
I baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is
mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize
you with (the \[Holy\] Ghost and) with fire; whose fan is in his hand,
and he will througly purge his floor, and gather his wheat unto the
garner, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

   (The baptism of Jesus, together with the descent of the Spirit and
the voice from heaven.)

([Matt. iv. 1](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#4:1.md)-11; [Luke iv.
1](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#4:1)-13..md)

   Jesus was led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of
the devil, and when he had fasted forty days and forty nigh he was
afterward an hungered, and the tempter said to him: If <span
id="page_619">p. 619</span> thou be the Son of God, command that these
stones become bread, and he answered: It is written, Man shall not live
by bread alone. Then he taketh him up to Jerusalem and setteth him on
the pinnacle of the temple, and saith to him: If thou be the Son of God,
cast thyself down; for it is written, He shall give his angels charge
concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any
time thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus said to him: Again it is
written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again he taketh him up
unto an exceeding high mountain and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the
world and the glory of them; and said unto him: All these things will I
give thee, if thou wilt worship me. And Jesus saith unto him: It is
written, The Lord thy God shalt thou worship and him only shalt thou
serve. And the devil leaveth him.

17](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#6:17), 20-23..md)

   (. . . multitudes . . . he taught his disciples, saying . . .)

   Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of God;

   Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted;

   Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled;

   Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall
say all manner of evil against you falsely. Rejoice and be exceeding
glad, for great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the
prophets which were before you.

 

4\.

([Matt. v. 39](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#5:39.md)-40; [Luke vi.
29](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#6:29)..md)

   Whosoever shall smite thee on the (thy right) cheek turn to him the
other also; and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy
coat, let him have thy cloke also.

 

5\.

([Matt. v. 42](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#5:42.md); [Luke vi.
30](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#6:30)..md)

   Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee
turn not thou away.

 

6\.

([Matt. v. 44](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#5:44.md)-48; [Luke vi.
27](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#6:27), 28, 35*b*, 32, 33, 36..md)

   I say unto you: Love your enemies and pray for them which persecute
you, that ye may be the sons of your Father, for he maketh the sun to
rise on the evil and on the good (and sendeth rain on the just and on
the unjust). For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? Do
not even the publicans the same? And if ye <span id="page_620">p.
620</span> salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? Do
not even the Gentiles the same? Be ye therefore merciful as your Father
is merciful.

 

7\.

([Matt. vii. 12](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#7:12.md); [Luke vi.
31](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#6:31)..md)

   All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even
so to them.

 

8\.

([Matt. vii. 1](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#7:1.md)-5; [Luke vi.
37](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#6:37), 38, 41, 42..md)

   Judge not, that ye be not judged; for with what judgment ye judge, ye
shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to
you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou
say to thy brother: Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye; and
behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first cast out the
beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out
the mote out of thy brother's eye.

 

11\.

([Matt. vii. 16](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#7:16.md)-18; xii. 33; [Luke vi.
43](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#6:43)-44..md)

   The tree is known by the fruit. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or
figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but
a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth
evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

 

12\.

([Matt. vii. 21](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#7:21.md), 24-27; [Luke vi.
46](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#6:46)-49..md)

   (Not everyone that saith unto me: Lord, Lord! shall enter into the
kingdom of God, but he that doeth the will of the Father.) Therefore
whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will shew you
whom he is like. He is like (or in place of the last; twelve words: He
shall be likened) unto a man which built his house upon a rock. And the
rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon
that house, and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock. And every
one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not, shall be
likened unto a man which built his house upon the sand. And the rain
descended and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that
house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.

([Matt. xv. 14](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#15:14.md); [Luke vi.
39](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#6:39)..md)

   If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

 

27\.

([Matt. vi. 9](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#6:9.md), 11-13; [Luke xi.
2](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#11:2)-4..md)

   (Father, give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors, and lead us not into temptation.)

 

28\.

([Matt. vii. 7](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#7:7.md)-11; [Luke xi.
9](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#11:9)-13..md)

   Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and
it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he
that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. Or
what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a
stone? Or if he ask for fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then,
being evil, know how to give good things (gifts) to your children, how
much more will the Father from heaven give good things to them that ask
him.

 

31\.

([Matt. v. 15](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#5:15.md); [Luke xi.
33](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#11:33)..md)

   Men do not light a candle and place it under a bushel, but on
candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.

 

32\.

([Matt. vi. 22](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#6:22.md), 23; [Luke xii.
34](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#12:34)-35..md)

   The light of the body is the (thine) eye; if therefore thine eye be
single, thy whole body shall be full of light; but if thine eye be evil,
thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is
in thee be darkened, how great is that darkness \[*scil*. in the
whole\]!

 

35\.

([Matt. vi. 25](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#6:25.md)-33; [Luke xii.
22](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#12:22)-31..md)

   Therefore I say unto you: Take no thought for your life, what ye
shall eat; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life
more than meat and the body more than raiment? Behold the ravens (or:
the fowls of the air); for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather
into barns; yet God feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
Which of you by taking thought can add one <span id="page_622">p.
622</span> cubit unto his stature? and why take ye thought for raiment?
Consider the lilies, how they grow? They toil not, neither do they spin;
and yet I say unto you (that) even Solomon în all his glory was not
arrayed like one of these. Wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the
field which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven shall he not
much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? Therefore take no thought
saying: What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or Wherewithall shall
we be clothed? For after all these things do the nations (of the world)
seek; for your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But
seek ye his kingdom, and all these things shall be added unto you.

 

36\.

([Matt. vi. 19](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#6:19.md)-21; [Luke xii.
33](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#12:33)-34..md)

   Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust
doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for
yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth
corrupt, and where theives do not break through nor steal; for where thy
(your) treasure is, there will thy (your) heart be also.

 

39\.

([Matt. v. 25](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#5:25.md)-26; [Luke xii.
58](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#12:58)-59..md)

   Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with
him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge and the
judge to the officer and thou be cast into prison. (Verily) I say unto
thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the
uttermost farthing.

 

41\.

([Matt. vii. 13](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#7:13.md)-14; [Luke xiii.
24](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#13:24)..md)

   Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide (is the gate) and broad is
the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in
thereat. Because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth
unto life, and few there be that find it.

 

47\.

([Matt. v. 13](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#5:13.md); [Luke xiv.
34](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#14:34)-35..md)

   Ye are the salt (of the earth); but if the salt have lost its savour,
wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing but to
be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.

<span id="page_623">p. 623</span>

 

49\.

([Matt. vi. 24](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#6:24.md); [Luke xvi.
13](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#16:13)..md)

   No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and
love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other.
Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

 

51\.

([Matt. v. 18](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#5:18.md); [Luke xvi.
17](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#16:17)..md)

   (Verily I say unto tou): Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one
tittle shall in no wise pass from the law.

 

52\.

([Matt. v. 32](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#5:32.md); [Luke xvi.
18](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#16:18)..md)

   (I say unto you: Whosoever shall put away his wife causeth her to
commit adultery, and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced
committeth adultery.

 

13\.

([Matt. vii. 28](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#7:28.md); viii. 5-10, 13; [Luke vii.
1](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#7:1)-10..md)

   He entered into Capernaum, and there came unto him a centurion
beseeching him and saying: Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the
palsy, grievously tormented. He saith unto him: I will come and heal
him. The centurion answered and said: Lord, I am not worthy that thou
shouldest come under my roof; but speak the word only and my servant
shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under
me, and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and
he cometh; and to my slave: Do this, and he doeth it. When Jesus heard
it he marvelled and said to them that followed, (Verily) I say unto you,
Not even in Israel have I found such faith. (And Jesus said to the
centurion: \[Go thy way;\] as thou hast believed, be it done unto thee.
And the servant was healed in the selfsame hour.)

([Matt. viii. 19](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#8:19.md)-22; [Luke ix.
57](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#9:57)-60..md)

   (Someone said to him): I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest;
and Jesus saith unto him: The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air
have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. Another
said to him: Suffer me first to go and bury my father; but he saith unto
him: Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.

18\.

([Matt. ix. 37](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#9:37.md)-38; [Luke x.

   He saith unto them (or: to his disciples): The harvest truly is
plenteous, but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the
harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.

 

16\.

([Matt. x. 7](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#10:7.md); [Luke ix.
2](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#9:2); x. 9-11..md)

   As ye go, preach, saying that the kingdom of God is at hand.

 

20\.

([Matt. x. 12](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#10:12.md)-13; [Luke x.
4](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#10:4)-6..md)

   (Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes, and salute no man by the
way) And when ye come into a house, salute it; and if the house be
worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it be not worthy, let your
peace return to you.

 

21\.

([Matt. x. 10](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#10:10.md)*b*; [Luke x.
7](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#10:7)..md)

   (And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as
they give); for the labourer is worthy of his hire.

 

22\.

([Matt. x. 15](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#10:15.md); [Luke x.
8](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#10:8)-12..md)

   ( . . . Into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you, eat such
things as are set before you and say unto them: The kingdom; of God is
at hand. But into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not, go
your ways out into the streets of the same and say: Even the very dust
of your city which cleaveth to our feet do we wipe off against you).
(Verily) I say unto you: It shall be more tolerable for the land of
Sodom and Gomorrha (or in place of the last six words: Sodom) in that
day (or: in the day of judgment) than for that city.

 

19:

([Matt. v. 16](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#5:16.md)*a*; [Luke x.

([Matt. x. 26](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#10:26.md)-33; [Luke xii.
2](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#12:2)-9..md)

   There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, and hid that
shall not be known. What I tell you in darkness that speak ye in <span
id="page_625">p. 625</span> light; and what ye hear in the ear that
preach ye upon the house-tops. And fear not them which kill the body but
are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to
destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two (five) sparrows sold for
a farthing (two farthings)? And one of them shall not fall on the ground
without God. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye
not (therefore), ye are of (much) more value than (many) sparrows.
Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will the Son of man
(or: I) confess also before the angels of God; but whosoever shall deny
me before men, him will I also deny before the angels of God.

 

34*b*.

([Matt. xii. 32](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#12:32.md); [Luke xii.

   . . . And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall
be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh (a word) against the Holy Ghost,
it shall not be forgiven him.

([Matt. x. 34](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#10:34.md)-36; [Luke xii.
51](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#12:51), 53..md)

   Think ye that I came to send peace on earth? I came not to send
peace, but a sword. For I came to set a man at variance against his
father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law
against her mother-in-law. (And a man's foes shall be they of his own
household.)

   The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant
as his lord.

   Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent
his disciples and said unto him: Art thou he that should come, or do we
look for another? And he answered and said unto them: Go and shew John
again those things which ye do hear and see, the blind receive their
sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear,
the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them;
and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me. And as they
departed, he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John: What went
ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? But what
went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold they that
wear soft clothing are in kings' houses! But what went ye out for to
see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet! For this
is he of whom it is written: Behold I send my messenger before thy face,
which shall prepare thy way before thee. (Verily) I say unto you among
them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John
(the Baptist); notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of God is
greater than he. . . .

 

50\.

([Matt. xi. 12](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#11:12.md)-13; [Luke xvi.

   The prophets and the law were until John; since that time the kingdom
of God suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force (or: From
the days of John until now the kingdom of God, etc.: for all the
prophets and the law prophesied until John) . . .

 

15\.

([Matt. xi. 16](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#11:16.md)-10; [Luke vii.
31](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#7:31)-35;.md)

   Whereunto shall I liken this generation (and to what is it like)? It
is like unto children sitting in the markets and calling unto their
<span id="page_627">p. 627</span> fellows, saying: We have piped unto
you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not
lamented. For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say: He
hath a devil! The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say,
Behold a man gluttonous and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and
sinners! But wisdom is justified of her children.

([Matt. xi. 21](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#11:21.md)-23; [Luke x.

   Woe unto thee, Chorazin! wo unto thee, Bethsaida! For if the mighty
works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would
have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But (I say unto you) it
shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon (at the day of judgment, or:
at the judgment) than for you. And thou Capernaum shalt thou have been
exalted to heaven? To hell shalt thou be cast down!<span

   At that time he said: I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and
hast revealed them unto babes; even so \[I thank thee\] Father, for so
it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered unto me of my
Father, and no man knoweth (the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any
man) the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
him.

([Matt. xiii. 16](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#13:16.md)-17; [Luke x.

   Blessed are your eyes, for they see, and (your) ears, for they hearr;
(for verily) I say unto you that many prophets (and kings) have desired
to see those things which ye see and have not seen them, and to hear
those things which ye hear and have not heard them.

[Luke xi. 14](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#11:14), 17, 19, 20, 23-26..md)

   (He healed) a dumb man possessed with a devil, (insomuch that) the
dumb spake and the multitudes (all) were amazed . . . every <span
id="page_628">p. 628</span> kingdom divided against itself is brought to
desolation . . . and if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do yout
children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. But if I
cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come
unto you . . . He that is not with me is against me, and he that
gathereth not with me scattereth abroad . . . When the unclean spirit is
gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth
none. (Then) he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came
out; and when he is come he findeth it empty (and) swept and garnished.
Then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked
than himself, and they enter in and dwell there, and the last state of
that man is worse than the first.

16](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#11:16), 29-32..md)

   We would see a sign from thee. But he said: An evil and adulterous
generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given to it
but the sign of Jonah. For as Jonah was a sign unto the Ninevites, so
shall also the Son of man be to this generation. The men of Nineveh
shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it,
because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold a greater
than Jonah is here. The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment
with this generation and shall condemn it, for she came from the
uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold a
greater than Solomon is here.

([Matt. xiii. 31](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#13:31.md)-33; [Luke xiii.
18](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#13:18)-21..md)

   (Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I liken it?
It is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his
field, and it grew and becameth a tree, and the birds of the air lodged
in the branches thereof.)

   (And again he said): To what shall I liken the kingdom of God? It is
like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal
till the whole was leavened.

([Matt. xxiii. 12](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#23:12.md); [Luke xiv.

   Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth
himself shall be exalted.

([Matt. viii. 11](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#8:11.md)-12; [Luke xiii.
28](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#13:28)-29..md)

   I say unto you: They shall come from the east and from the west, and
shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of God;
but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out; there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.

 

48\.

([Matt. xviii. 12](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#18:12.md)-13; [Luke xv.
4](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#15:4)-7..md)

   How think ye? If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone
astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine upon the mountains, and go
and seek that which has gone astray? And if so be that he find it,
(verily) I say unto you he rejoiceth more of it than of the ninety and
nine which went not astray.

([Matt. xviii. 7](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#18:7.md); [Luke xvii.

   It must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by the
offense cometh.

([Matt. xviii. 15](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#18:15.md), 21-22; [Luke xvii.
3](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#17:3)-4..md)

   If thy brother shall trespass against thee, tell him his fault; if he
shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother . . . How oft shall my
brother sin against me and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith
unto him: I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy
times seven.

 

55\.

([Matt. xvii. 20](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#17:20.md)*b*; [Luke xvii.
6](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#17:6)..md)

   If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this
mountain: Remove from hence to yonder place, and it shall remove.

([Matt. xxiii. 4](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#23:4.md), 13, 23, 25, 27, 29,

44, 47-52.)

   . . . They bind heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders, and
they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.

   Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye shut up the kingdom of God against
men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are
entering to go in.

<span id="page_630">p. 630</span>

   Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and
cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment and
mercy.

   Now ye Pharisees! ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the
platter, but within they are full; of extorsion and excess.

   ([Luke xi. 44](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#11:44)..md) Woe unto you, for ye
are as sepulchers which appear not, and the men that walk over them are
not aware of them.

   ([Matt. xxiii. 27](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#23:27)..md) (Woe unto you,
Pharisees! for ye are like unto whited sepulchers, which indeed appear
beautiful outward, but within are full of dead men's bones and of all
uncleanness.)

   Woe unto you! because ye build the tombs of the prophets and say: If
we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers
with them in the blood of the prophets. Wherefore ye be witnesses
against yourselves that ye are the children of of them which killed the
prophets, (and now fulfil the measure of your fathers)!

   Wherefore also the Wisdom of God said: I send unto you prophets and
wise men and scribes; some of them ye shall kill and persecute; that
upon you may come all the blood shed upon the earth from the blood of
Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, whom ye slew between the temple and
the altar. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
generation.

([Matt. xxiii. 37](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#23:37.md)-39; [Luke xiii.
34](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#13:34)-35..md)

   O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! thou that killest the prophets and stonest
them which are sent unto thee! How often would I have gathered thy
children together, even as a hen (gathereth) her chickens under her
wings, and ye would not! Behold your house is left unto you desolate.
(For) I say unto you: Ye shall not see me henceforth till (it shall come
when) ye shall say: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

 

56\.

([Matt. xxiv. 26](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#24:26.md)-28, 37-41; [Luke xvii.
23](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#17:23)-24, 37, 26-27, 34-35..md)

   Wherefore if they shall say unto you: Behold, he is in the desert! Go
ye not forth. Behold, he is in the secret chambers! Believe it not. For
as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west,
so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For wheresoever the
carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.

<span id="page_631">p. 631</span>

   As the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man
be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and
drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah
entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came and took them
all away, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. There shall be
two in the field, one shall be taken and the other left; two women shall
be grinding at the mill, the one shall be taken and the other left.

 

37\.

([Matt. xxiv. 43](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#24:43.md)-51; [Luke xii.
39](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#12:39)-40, 42-46..md)

   But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what
watch the thief would come, he would have watched and would not have
suffered his houie to be broken up. (Therefore be ye also ready, for in
such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.) Who then is a
faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his
bousebold to give them meat in due season? Blessed is that servant whom
his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that
he shall make him rule over all his goods. But and if that (evil)
servant shall say in his heart: My lord delayeth his coming, and shall
begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the
drunken, the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh
not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him
asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites.

 

58\.

([Matt. xxv. 29](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#25:29.md); [Luke xix.
26](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#19:26)..md)

   Unto him (everyone) that hath shall be given, and he shall have
abundance; but from him that hath not, shall be taken away even that
which he hath.

 

59\.

([Matt. xix. 28](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#19:28.md); [Luke xxii.
28](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#22:28), 30..md)

   Ye who have followed me . . . shall sit upon twelve thrones. judging
the twelve tribes of Israel.

   (Perhaps also the parables of the Great Supper and the Talents stood
in Q.)
