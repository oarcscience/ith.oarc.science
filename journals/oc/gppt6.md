## BUDDHA'S DISCOURSE ON THE END OF THE WORLD;<span id="page_428_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_428_note_1.md)

OR, THE SERMON ON THE SEVEN SUNS.

<span class="small">Now first translated from the Pâli by ALBERT J.
EDMUNDS.</span>

PREFATORY NOTE.

<span class="small"></span>

   A late expansion of this discourse is given by Warren, in his
*Buddhism in Translations*, from Buddhagosha's *Way of Purity*, a Pâli
compendium of the fifth Christian century.<span
id="page_428_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_428_note_2.md) When Warren wrote, the
Pâli original had not as yet appeared in the edition of the Pâli Text
Society, which is printed in Roman letters.

   It is well known to New Testament scholars that the great
Eschatological Discourse in the Synoptical Gospels (i.e., the Sermon on
the Last Things, delivered upon the Mount of Olives) is a blending of
historical and spiritual vaticination. As I pointed out in 1893,<span
id="page_428_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_428_note_3.md) the Evangelist Luke
attempted to separate the spiritual prophecy from the historical
prediction, putting the former into his seventeenth chapter, and the
latter into his twenty-first. But Luke evidently understood even the
physical cataclysm to refer to the siege of Jerusalem and the
destruction of the Hebrew State. Even Mark and the editor of Matthew
probably understood the same thing, though our English translations of
Matthew make his "consummation of the æon" the "end of the world." After
the siege, the early Christians evidently made this Eschatological
Discourse refer to a cosmical convulsion. But the only words which can
justly apply to such a thing are those in all three of the Synoptists:
"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
away."<span id="page_428_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_428_note_4.md) We have therefore used
this verse among our parallels to Buddha's present discourse, but have
reserved the text of the Gospel prophecy for a forthcoming translation
from the famous *Anâgata-bhayâni*, selected by Asoko among his favorite
texts. Its subject is the decline of religion.

THE END OF THE WORLD.

> <span class="small">[Mark xiii. 31](../../bib/kjv/mar.htm#13:31.md).
> Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
> away.</span>

> <span class="small">[2 Peter iii. 10](../../bib/kjv/pe2.htm#3:10.md). But
> the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens

> elements) shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the

> <span class="small">[Rev. xxi. 1](../../bib/kjv/rev.htm#21:1.md). And I

<span class="small">NUMERICAL COLLECTION VII. 62.</span>

   Thus have I heard. At one season the Blessed One was staying at
Vesâli, in Ambapâli's grove. And the Blessed One addressed the monks,
saying: "Monks!" "Lord!" answered those monks, in reply to him. The
Blessed One spake thus:

   "Impermanent, O monks, are the constituents of existence, unstable,
non-eternal: so much so, that this alone is enough to weary and disgust
one with all constituent things, and emancipate therefrom. Sineru,
monks, the monarch of montains, is eighty-four thousand leagues<span
id="page_429_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_429_note_1.md) in length and breadth;
eighty-four thousand lagues deep in the great ocean, and eighty-four
thousand above it.

   Now there comes, O monks, a season when, after many years, many
hundreds and thousands and hundreds of thousands of years, it does not
rain; and while it rains not, all seedlings and vegetation, all plants,
grasses, and trees dry up, wither away and cease to be. Thus, monks,
constituent things are impermanent, unstable, non-eternal: so much so,
that this alone is enough to weary and disgust one therewith and
emancipate therefrom.

   And, monks, there comes a season, at vast intervals in the lapse of
time, when a second sun appears.

   After the appearance of the second sun, monks, the brooks and ponds
dry up, vanish away and cease to be. So impermanent are constituent
things! And then, monks, there comes a season, at vast intervals in the
lapse of time, when a third sun appears; and thereupon the great rivers:
to wit, the Ganges, the Jamna, the Rapti, the Gogra, the Mahî,--dry up,
vanish away and cease to be.

   At length, after another vast period, a fourth sun appears, and
thereupon the great lakes, whence those rivers had their rise: namely,
Anotatto,<span id="page_429_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_429_note_2.md) Lion-leap,
Chariot-maker, Keel-bare, Cuckoo, Six-bayed, and Slow-flow, dry up,
vanish away, and cease to be.

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

   Again, monks, when, after another long lapse, a fifth sun appears,
the waters in the great ocean go down for an hundred leagues; then for
two hundred, three hundred, and even unto seven hundred leagues, until
the water stands only seven fan-palms' deep, and so on unto one
fan-palm; then seven fathoms' deep, and so on unto one fathom, half a
fathom; waist-deep, knee-deep, ankle-deep. Even, O monks, as in the fall
season, when it rains in large drops, the waters in some places are
standing around the feet of the kine; even so, monks, the waters in the
great ocean in some places are standing to the depth of kine-feet. After
the appearance of the fifth sun, monks, the water in the great ocean is
not the measure of a finger-joint. Then at last, after another lapse of
time, a sixth sun appears; whereupon this great earth and Sineru, the
monarch of mountains, reek and fume and send forth clouds of smoke. Even
as a potter's baking, when first besmeared, doth reek and fume and
smoke, such is the smoke of earth and mountains when the sixth sun
appears.

   After a last vast interval, a seventh sun appears, and then, monks,
this great earth, and Sineru, the monarch of mountains, flare and blaze,
and become one mass of flame. And now, from earth and mountains burning
and consuming, a spark is carried by the wind and goes as far as the
worlds of God; and the peaks of Mount Sineru, burning, consuming,
perishing, go down in one vast mass of fire and crumble for an hundred,
yea, five hundred leagues. And of this great earth, monks, and Sineru,
the monarch of mountains, when consumed and burnt, neither ashes nor
soot remains. Just as when ghee or oil is consumed and burnt, monks,
neither ashes nor soot remains, so it is with the great earth and Mount
Sineru.

   Thus, monks, impermanent are the constituents of existence, unstable,
non-eternal: so much so, that this alone is enough to weary and disgust
one with all constituent things and emancipate therefrom. Therefore,
monks, do those who deliberate and believe<span
id="page_430_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_430_note_1.md) say this: 'This earth
and Sineru, the monarch of mountains, will be burnt and perish and exist
no more,' excepting those who have seen the path.

 

FORMER RELIGIONS ECLIPSED BY THE RELIGION OF LOVE.<span

   "In olden times, O monks, there was a religious teacher (or Master)
named Sunetto, founder of an order, and free from indulgence in lusts;
and he had several hundred disciples. The Master Sunetto preached to his
disciples the doctrine of fellowship with the world of God; and those
who understood all his religion in every way, when he preached this
doctrine, were born again, upon the dissolution of the body after death,
to weal in the world of God. Those who did not understand all his
religion in every way, were born again, upon the dissolution of the body
after death,--some into fellowship with those angels who transmute
subjective delights into objective and share them with others;<span
id="page_431_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_431_note_1.md) some into fellowship
with the angels who delight in subjective creations; some into that of
the angels of Content (*Tusitâ*); others with the *Yâmâ*; others again
with the angels of the Thirty-three; others into fellowship with those
of the Four Great Kings; and yet others into fellowship with Warrior
magnates, Brahmin magnates, householder magnates.

   "Now Sunetto the Master, O monks, thought to himself: 'It is not fit
that I should allow my disciples to have such destinies as these
repeatedly: what now if I practise the Highest Love?' Whereupon, monks,
the Master Sunetto practised Benevolence (or, love-meditation) for seven
years, and for seven æons of consummation and restoration he did not
return to this world.<span id="page_431_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_431_note_2.md) Yea, monks, at the
consummation of the world<span id="page_431_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_431_note_3.md) he became an Angel of
Splendor, and at the world's restoration he rose again in the empty
palace of the Brahmâs. Yea, then, O monks, he was a Brahmâ, the Great
Brahmâ (or, God), conquering, unconquered, all-seeing, controlling. And
thirty-six times, O monks, was he Sakko, the lord of the angels; many
hundreds of times was he a king, a righteous world-ruler and emperor,
victorious to the four seas, arrived at the security of his country, and
possessed of the seven treasures. Moreover, he had more than a thousand
sons, heroes, of mighty frame, crushers of alien armies; he dwelt in
this ocean-girt earth, <span id="page_432">p. 432</span> overcoming it,
staffless and swordless, by righteousness. But even the Master Sunetto,
though thus long-lived and long-enduring, was not emancipated from
birth, old age, death, grief, lamentations, pains, sorrows, and
despairs; I say he was not emancipated from pain. And why? Because of
not being awake to four things (*dhammâ*), and not seeing into them.
What four? The Noble Ethics, the Noble Trance (*Samâdhi*), the Noble
Wisdom, and the Noble Release (or Emancipation). When these, O monks,
known in their sequence and penetrated into,<span
id="page_432_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_432_note_1.md) the craving for
existence is annihilated, its renewal is destroyed: one is then reborn
no more."

   Thus spake the Blessed One, and when the Auspicious One had said
this, the Master further said:

   "Morality, Trance, Pure Reason, and Supreme Release;

   "These things are understood by the celebrated Gotamo,

   "Thus enlightened (*buddho*) by supernal knowledge, he told the
doctrine to the monks.

   "The Master, who made an end of pain, the Seeing One, hath passed
into Nirvâna."

standard whereby to gauge the perpetuity of the oracles of Christ.

the meaning of this word and its Sanskrit Equivalent *Anavatapta*, but
it appears to mean "without warmth at the bottom."

uncertain. The word *saddhâtâ* is not in Childers, and I can find no
equivalent in Sanskrit; but the various reading, *saddhâratâ*, indicates
the sense.
