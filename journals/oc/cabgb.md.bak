PREFATORY NOTE.

   THERE are two canonical accounts of the wonderful circumstances
attending the birth of Gotama, viz., the *Nâlaka Sutta* in the Sutta
Nipâta, which was translated by Dr. Fausböll in 1881 (*Sacred Books of
the East*, Vol. X., part 2, [p.
124](../../bud/sbe10/sbe1035.htm#sect_11).md) and the Dialogue in the
Middling Collection, now translated for the first time. This was first
pointed out by Oldenberg in 1881, in his *Life of Buddha*, where he gave
us one or two details concerning it (Oldenberg's *Buddha*, English
translation, 1882, p. 417). In 1894, Chalmers gave an account of it in
the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, and the Pâli text was printed
by him in the same learned Journal for October, 1895. It is from this
text that our translation is made, except that in some doubtful readings
I have compared the version of the King of Siam, which has lately been
distributed throughout the United States.

   An uncanonical account of Gotama's birth (apart from the inevitable
commentary on our present text) is to be found in the Commentary on the
Birth Stories. This account has been twice translated: by Rhys Davids in
1880 (*Buddhist Birth Stories*), and by Henry C. Warren in 1896
(*Buddhism in Translations*, [p. 38](../../bud/bits/bits004).md). It is
based upon our present Sutta and the one in the Sutta Nipâta. The
portion based upon the latter is given by Warren at [p.
48](../../bud/bits/bits005.md). As in the case of the Haggadah of the
Hebrews, it was reckoned quite fair among the ancient Hindus, to add
embellishments to a narrative in the form of commentary. It will be
seen, however, that not even in the commentary do the Buddhists <span
id="page_486">p. 486</span> claim for their master a virginal nativity,
but only a birth attended with marvels. The idea that Gotama remembered
being born and remembered also a pre-existent state is derived from the
familiar doctrine of transmigration.

   All other accounts of the Buddha's nativity, such as those translated
from the Sanskrit or Chinese, of which we have a specimen in *Sacred
Books of the East*, Vols. XIX. and
[XLIX.](../../bud/sbe49/sbe4903.md),<span
id="page_486_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_486_note_1.md) are late patristic
poems, on an entirely different footing from the canonical Pâli texts.
There is no doubt that these last have come down to us from the men who
knew Gotama. Our present Sutta is quoted in a work as old as the
Christian era (the *Questions of King Milinda*); and the chain of
transmission is strong.

 

DIALOGUE ON WONDERS AND MARVELS.

(*Majjhima Nikâya*, *Sutta* 123.)

   THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was staying at
Sâvatthi in the Jetavana cloister-garden of Anâthap.n.dika. Now a number
of monks, after returning from the quest of alms, and having eaten their
meal, were sitting assembled in the room of state, when the following
conversation arose:

   "Wonderful, O brother! marvellous, O brother! is the occult power and
magical might of the<span id="page_486_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_486_note_2.md) Tathâgata: when, for
instance, upon the decease of the former Buddha, who has broken down
obstacles and avenues, exhausted his transmigrations and passed beyond
all pain, the Tathâgata perceives: 'Such were the families of the
Blessed Ones, such were the names of the Blessed Ones; their clans were
so-and-so; such were their moral codes, such their doctrines, their
knowledges, their dwellings, and those whom they delivered.'"

   After such talk as this, the venerable Ânanda addressed the monks and
said: "Wonderful, brethren, are the Tathâgatas, and endowed with
wonderful qualities; marvellous, brethren! are the Tathâgatas, and
endowed with marvellous qualities."

   Such was the course of conversation among the monks when it was
broken off. Now, the Blessed One, having arisen from retirement at
eventide, came into the room of state and sat down upon the seat
prepared for him. While sitting there the Blessed One addressed the
monks and said: "Monks! What now is the subject of your conversation
while sitting together? And what, <span id="page_487">p. 487</span>
moreover, was the course of your conversation which you just broke off?

   \[They answered\]: "Here, Lord, having returned from the quest of
alms and having eaten our meal, we have been sitting assembled in the
room of state, when the following conversation arose: 'Wonderful, O
brother! marvellous, O brother! is the occult power and magical might of
the Tathâgata,' (etc., repeated from above, down to the end of Ânanda's
speech). "This, Lord, was the course of conversation which was broken
off. Just then the Blessed One arrived."

   Hereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ânanda: "And so,
Ânanda, the wonderful and marvellous qualities of the Tathâgata become
more and more apparent."

   \[Ananda replied\]: "*In my presence, Lord, was it heard \[from the
lips\] of the Blessed One, and in my presence received:* 'Ânanda, the
Bodhisat is mindful and conscious of being born when he is born with the
Tusita body.' *This fact, Lord, that the Bodhisat was mindful and
conscious when he was born with the Tusita body, I hold to be a
wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One.*"

   2. "'Ânanda, the Bodhisat abode for a lifetime in the Tusita
body.<span id="page_487_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_487_note_1.md)

   3. "'*Ânanda, the Bodhisat is mindful and conscious when he leaves
the Tusita body and descends into his mother's womb.* \[These words
occur identically in the Pâli, in slightly different order, in the Book
of the Great Decease III. 15. *Sacred Books of the East*, Vol. XI., [p.
46](../../bud/sbe11/sbe1102.htm#page_46.md).\]

   4. "'Ânanda, when the Bodhisat leaves the Tusita body and descends
into his mother's womb, then in the world of the devas, together with
those of Mâra and Brahma, and unto the race of sama.nas and brahmans,
devas, and mortals, there appears a splendor limitless and eminent,
surpassing the might of the devas. And even in the boundless realms of
space, with their darkness upon darkness, where yonder sun and moon, so
magical, so mighty, are felt not in the sky, there too appears the
splendor limitless and eminent, surpassing the very might of the devas,
so that beings who are born there observe among themselves by reason of
that splendor: "Friend, indeed there are other beings born here, and
this ten-thousand world-system rocks and quakes and tremendously
trembles: a splendor limitless and eminent appears in the universe
surpassing even the might of the devas."

<span id="page_488">p. 488</span>

   5. "'Ânanda, when the Bodhisat descends into his mothers womb, the
four sons of the devas who keep watch over the four quarters approach
him and say: "Let neither mortals nor demons do harm unto the Bodhisat
or the Bodhisat's mother!"

   6. "'Ânanda, when the Bodhisat is descending into his mother's womb,
she is pure from sexuality,<span id="page_488_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_488_note_1.md) has abstained from
taking life, from theft, from lusts, from evil conduct, from lying, and
from all kinds of wine and strong drink, which are a cause of
irreligion.

   7. "'Ânanda, when the Bodhisat is descending into his mother's womb,
among the attendants around her no lustful thought arises, and she is
unsurpassed by any shining attendant of the night.

   8. "'Ânanda, when the Bodhisat is descending into his mother's womb,
she is possessed of the five qualities of pleasure; she is surrounded
by, established in, and endowed with the five qualities of pleasure.

   9. "'Ânanda, . . . the Bodhisat's mother has no sickness at all, but
is happy in a body free from pain, and sees the Bodhisat transparently
in the womb (literally, gone across the womb) in full possession of all
his limbs and faculties. Even as a gem or precious stone, Ânanda, being
radiant, fine, octagonal, and well wrought, is therefore strung upon a
dark-blue string or upon a tawny or a red or a white or a yellow string,
so that any man with eyes, upon taking it in his hand, may reflect:
"This gem or precious stone, being radiant (etc. . . . . .) is therefore
strung upon this dark-blue string, or . . . yellow string,"--even so,
Ânanda, when the Bodhisat descends into his mother's womb, his mother
has no sickness at all, but is happy in a body free from pain, and sees
the Bodhisat transparently in the womb in full possession of all his
limbs and faculties.

   10. "'Ânanda, seven days after the birth of the Bodhisat, his mother
departed this life, and was born with the Tusita body.

   11. "'Moreover, Ânanda, while other women bring forth after a
gestation of nine or ten months, the Bodhisat's mother does not <span
id="page_489">p. 489</span> act in the usual way with the Bodhisat: just
ten months does she carry the Bodhisat before she brings him forth.

   12. "'Moreover, Ânanda, while other women bring forth when sitting or
lying down, the Bodhisat's mother does not bring forth the Bodhisat in
the usual way: she actually brings him forth standing.

   13. "'Ânanda, when the Bodhisat leaves his mother's womb, devas are
the first to receive him, and mortals afterwards.

   14. "'Ânanda, when the Bodhisat leaves his mother's womb, he does not
touch the ground: four sons of the devas stand before his mother and
receive him. "Be thou a blessed goddess," they say: "unto thee is born
an eminent son."<span id="page_489_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_489_note_1.md)

   15. "'Ânanda, when the Bodhisat leaves his mother's womb, he leaves
it quite clean, undefiled with matter or blood, but pure, clean, and
undefiled by any impurity. As in the case of a gem or a jewel, Ânanda,
laid in Benâres cloth, the gem or jewel does not defile the shining<span
id="page_489_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_489_note_2.md) cloth at all, nor the
Benâres cloth the jewel or the gem (and why?--because they both are
pure): even so, Ânanda, when the Bodhisat leaves his mother's womb, he
leaves it quite clean, undefiled with matter or blood, but pure, clean,
and undefiled by any impurity.

   16. "'Ânanda, . . . there come two showers of water from the sky, one
of cool water and the other of warm, to supply the needed water for the
Bodhisat and his mother.

   17. "'Ânanda, the new-born Bodhisat stands sheer upright on his feet,
walks northwards with a seven-paced stride, holding<span
id="page_489_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_489_note_3.md) over himself a white
canopy, and looking forth in all directions utters the bull-like speech:
"I am the chief of the universe, I am the best in the universe, I am the
eldest in the universe. This is my last existence: I shall now be born
no more!"

   18. "'Ânanda, when the Bodhisat leaves his mother's womb, then in the
world of devas, together with those of Mâra and Brahma, and unto the
race of sama.nas and brahmans, devas, and mortals, there appears a
splendor limitless and eminent, surpassing the might of the devas; and
even in the boundless realms of space, with their darkness upon
darkness, where yonder sun and moon, so magical, so mighty, are felt not
in the sky, there too appears <span id="page_490">p. 490</span> the
splendor limitless and eminent, surpassing the very might of the devas,
so that beings who are born there consider<span
id="page_490_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_490_note_1.md) among themselves by
reason of that splendor: "Friend, indeed there are other beings born
here, and this ten-thousand world-system rocks and quakes and
tremendously trembles: a splendor limitless and eminent appears in the
universe surpassing even the might of the devas."

   "'Therefore, Ânanda, do thou hold this also to be a wonderful and
marvellous quality of the Tathâgata. In this world, Ânanda, the
sensations of the Tathâgata are known when they arise, are known when
they continue, are known when they decline. Known are the phases of his
consciousness when they arise; his reflections are known when they arise
and known when they decline. Therefore, Ânanda, do thou hold this also
to be a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Tathâgata.'

   "This fact also, Lord, that the sensations of the Blessed One are
known when they arise, are known when they continue, are known when they
decline; that his phases of consciousness are known when they arise;
that his reflections are known when they arise, known when they
continue, and known when they decline,--this also, Lord, I hold to be a
wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One."

   Thus spoke the venerable Ânanda. The Master assented, and the monks
were rapt and rejoiced at the discourse of the venerable Ânanda.

   \[Here ends\] the Dialogue on Wonders and Marvels, third \[in a
particular subdivision of the Middling Collection\].

<span id="page_701">p. 701</span>

THE ANTIQUITY OF THE BUDDHIST NATIVITY SUTTA.

<span class="small"></span>

   An eminent New Testament scholar has asked me to give proof of the
antiquity of this document, which I translated in *The Open Court* for
August last. Pending a longer article, I will briefly say that the title
of Sutta 61<span id="page_701_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_701_note_1.md) of the Majjhima Nikâya
is graven on the Bairât Rock in India, among other canonical titles.
This inscription, by the Emperor Asoka, dates from the third century
before Christ. Other inscriptions of the same date speak of reciters of
the Pitakas, reciters of the Suttas, and reciters of the Five Nikâyas,
whereof the Majjhima is one. Moreover, on Asoka's stûpa at Bharhut there
is a picture of Gotama's mother's dream of his descent into her womb.
This dream is not in the canonical text, but in the commentaries. Now if
the commentary was used in the third century before Christ, *à fortiori*
the text was.

   In the preface to my translation, I said that "our present Sutta" was
quoted in *Milinda*. This was a mistake, into which I was led by want of
access to the Pâli of *Milinda*. I should have said "our present
Nikâya," whereof the Nativity Sutta is an integral part.

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

A FURTHER NOTE ON THE BUDDHIST NATIVITY SUTTA.

<span class="small"></span>

   Since writing my note in the November number, I have made further
researches into the sources of this document. I have found large
portions of it in other parts of the Pâli canon, and am convinced that
it is one of the most fundamental narratives, on a footing with the Book
of the Great Decease. Thus, the statement that the mothers of Bodhisats
always die a week after the Nativity is in the Udâna (V. 2). The
splendors and earthquakes at Buddha's descent from heaven and birth in
the world, are in the A.nguttara-Nikâya (IV. 127) and partly also in the
Sanskrit Divyâvadâna, p. 204. But, above all, nearly the entire Nativity
Sutta (Majjhima 123) translated by me last August, is embedded in the
Dîgha-Nikâya (Mahâpadhâna-Sutta, No. 14), where it is told of a former
Buddha, Vipassî. I made my translation in March, 1897, and my increasing
knowledge of Pâli leads me to correct the second paragraph, which should
run thus:

   "Wonderful, O brother! marvellous, O brother! is the occult power and
magical might of the Tathâgata: when, for example, he has knowledge of
bygone Buddhas who have gone into Nirvâna, have broken down obstacles
and avenues, exhausted their transmigrations and passed beyond all pain;
and the Tathâgata perceives: 'Such were the families of the Blessed
Ones, such were the names of the Blessed Ones; their clans were
so-and-so; such were their moral codes, such their doctrines, their
wisdom, their dwellings, and their manner of release.'"

   The Nativity Suttas (including the one in the Sutta-Nipâta) lie
behind the Lalita Vistara and other early poems and commentaries. They
probably constituted one of the ancient Nine Divisions of the canon,
called Marvels. Together with the First Sermon, the Chain of Causation,
the Confessional, the Antinomies of the <span id="page_380">p.
380</span> Schools and the Book of the Great Decease, they rank among
those prime documents of the religion around which all recensions rally.

<span id="footnotes_page_486">p. 486</span>

<span id="page_486_note_1"></span>[1](#page_486_fr_1.md). These two volumes
represent the same work, Vol. XIX. being translated from a Chinese
version, Vol. XLIX. from the Sanskrit original.

<span id="page_486_note_2"></span>[2](#page_486_fr_2.md). The indefinite
article may be read here with equal propriety.

<span id="footnotes_page_487">p. 487</span>

<span id="page_487_note_1"></span>[1](#page_487_fr_1.md). Repetitions
similar to those italicised in the above paragraph occur at the
beginning and end of the eighteen statements which follow. They are here
numbered for convenience.

<span id="footnotes_page_488">p. 488</span>

<span id="page_488_note_1"></span>[1](#page_488_fr_1.md). Cf. Diogenes
Laërtius on the birth of Plato: "Then he kept her pure of marriage until
the birth." (*Lives of the Philosophers*, Bk. 3.)

This abstinence, ascribed to the mother of Plato, we know from the
context to imply a divine paternity, such as that which is the subject
of the *Ion* of Euripides. The abstinence of Gotama's mother, on the
other hand, implies no such thing, but refers merely to the period of
gestation. Such abstinence is enjoined in the *Institutes of Vishnu*,
LXIX. 17, and was also observed by Essenes. (Josephus, *Wars*, II. viii.
13.) It is a familiar practice of Oriental hygiene. Moreover Gotama is
credited with parents. (*Milinda*, IV. 4. 11, quoted from some Sutta not
known Rhys Davids in 1890.)

<span id="footnotes_page_489">p. 489</span>

<span id="page_489_note_1"></span>[1](#page_489_fr_1.md). Cf. [Luke i.
28](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#1:28.md).

<span id="page_489_note_2"></span>[2](#page_489_fr_2.md).The King of Siam
repeats "Benâres cloth" here: *Kâsikavattha.m*, instead of *Kâsita.m
vattha.m*.

<span id="page_489_note_3"></span>[3](#page_489_fr_3.md). A participle in
the Middle Voice. The commentary on the Birth Stories says that the god
Brahma held it! *Canopy* appears to me a more dignified translation than
"parasol" or "umbrella." It is an emblem of royalty.

<span id="page_490_note_1"></span>[1](#page_490_fr_1.md). This is
practically the only verbal difference in this stereotyped repetition.
