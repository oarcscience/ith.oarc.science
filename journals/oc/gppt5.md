APOSTOLIC SUCCESSION.

> <span class="small">[Matthew xvi. 17-19](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#16:17.md).
> And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
> Bar-Jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my
> Father which is in heaven. And I also say unto thee, that thou art
> Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of
> Hades shall not prevail against it. I will give unto thee the keys of
> the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall
> be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
> loosed in heaven.</span>

DIALOGUE CXI.</span>

   MONKS, it is only of Sâriputto that one can truly say: He is a lawful
son of the Blessed One, born of his mouth, born of his religion,
spiritually created, a spiritual kinsman, not a carnal one. Sâriputto, O
monks, keeps up the incomparable empire of religion set going once for
all by the Tathâgato.

   Monks, I do not perceive another single individual who keeps up the
incomparable empire of religion set going once for all by the Tathâgato,
excepting Sâriputto.

   Sâriputto, O monks, keeps up the incomparable empire of religion set
going once for all by the Tathâgato.

   Monks, the eldest son of a king who is a world-ruler (*Cakkavatti*)
is endowed with five attributes, and keeps up the empire (lit., keeps
the wheel rolling) set going by his father by righteousness alone: that
is the wheel which cannot be turned back by any human being, by any
hostile hand.

   What are the five attributes?

   In this world, monks, the eldest son of a king who is a world-ruler
<span id="page_44">p. 44</span> is worldly-wise, and spiritually wise,
temperate, wise in the times, and wise in the assemblies.

   Monks, the eldest son of a king who is a world-ruler is endowed with
these five attributes, and keeps up the empire set going by his father
by righteousness alone: that is the wheel that cannot be turned back by
any human being, by any hostile hand.

   Exactly thus, monks, does Sâriputto, with five qualities (*dhammas*)
endowed, keep up the incomparable empire of religion, set going once for
all by the Tathâgato: that is the wheel that cannot be turned back by
philosopher or brahmin, angel or Tempter, arch-angel, or any one in the
world.

   What are the five qualities?

   In this case, monks, Sâriputto is worldly-wise, spiritually wise,
temperate, wise in the times and wise in the assemblies.

   With these five qualities endowed, monks, does Sâriputto keep up the
incomparable empire of religion set going once for all by the Tathâgato:
that is the wheel that cannot be turned back by philosopher or brahmin,
angel or Tempter, archangel, or any one in the world.

SAVING POWER OF BELIEF.

   Monks, I do not perceive another single quality whereby beings, upon
the dissolution of the body after death, rise again in states of
suffering, woe, destruction and hell, to be compared, O monks, to false
belief.

   Beings, possessed of false belief, O monks, upon the dissolution of
the body after death, rise again in states of suffering, woe,
destruction and hell.

   Monks, I do not perceive another single quality whereby beings, upon
the dissolution of the body after death, rise again in the world of weal
and paradise, to be compared, O monks, with Right Belief.<span

   Beings, possessed of Right Belief, O monks, upon the dissolution of
the body after death, rise again in the world of paradise.

 

THE LOGIA.

   JESUS SAITH is the formula in the Egyptian Logia-fragment found in
1897 {Greek fragments of [The Gospel of Thomas](../../chr/thomas.md)}, and
of frequent occurrence in the Gospels. The ancient Christian Logia-Book,
or primitive Gospel of Matthew mentioned by Papas (Eusebius, H. E. iii.
39) is lost; but the Buddhists are more fortunate in having their
Logia-Book extant. It is called the ITIVUTTAKA, that is, the
*Thus-Said*. Its antiquity is attested not only by the internal evidence
of terseness and simplicity, but by the external evidence that the name
itself is one of the ancient Nine Divisions of the Scriptures which
antedate the present arrangement of the Pâli Canon. The formulæ of the
Itivuttaka are the following:

   1. *This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Holy One, and heard
by me:*

   2. *This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said, and here it is
rendered thus \[in verse\].*

   3. *Exactly thus is the meaning spoken by the Blessed One, and thus
it was heard by me.*

   These three formulæ accompany each of the first 79 paragraphs
(suttas) of the Itivuttaka; No. 80 has the first two formulæ only; Nos.
81-88 have none of them; Nos. 89 and 90 have all; Nos. 91-98 have none;
Nos. 99 and 100 have all; Nos. 101-111 have none; the closing sutta, No.
112, has all three. Five of the suttas that want the formulæ (Nos. 101,
105, 108, 110, 111) are found in the Numerical Collection, as well as
two where they have been supplied (Nos. 90 and 112). It is therefore
probable that the original Itivuttaka has been added to, and this is
borne out by the fact that the suttas increase in length towards the
end. Moreover, the suttas borrowed from the Numerical Collection all
occur after No. 80, where the formulæ cease to be regular.<span
id="page_45_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_45_note_1.md)

   The earlier part of the Itivuttaka appears to be of great antiquity.
Its themes are found all through the Canon in a more developed form, but
they are here expressed with a terse simplicity and with the solemn
deposition in each case that Buddha spoke them.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_43">p. 43</span>

<span id="page_43_note_1"></span>[1](#page_43_fr_1.md). Counting *The
Penitent Thief* (October) as the Fourth Series.

<span id="footnotes_page_44">p. 44</span>

<span id="page_44_note_1"></span>[1](#page_44_fr_1.md). The first step in
the Noble Eightfold Path of Gotamo's famous Sermon in the Deer Park near
Benâres. The doctrine of the saving power of Belief is thus fundamental
in Buddhism. <span id="footnotes_page_45">p. 45</span> See also
Itivuttaka, 32, 33. The word *Belief* is literally *Sight* and can also
be rendered *View* or *Speculation*.

<span id="page_45_note_1"></span>[1](#page_45_fr_1.md). If it be said that
the Anguttara borrowed certain suttas because they were numerical, the
fact confronts us that Nos, 108 and 110 to 112 are not numerical; while
Nos, 1-6, which are not borrowed at all, one would expect to find in the
Eka-Nipâto.
