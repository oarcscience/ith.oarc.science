## THE EARLY VAISHNAVA POETS OF BENGAL.

### I. BIDYÂPATI.

BY JOHN BEAMES, B.C.S., M.R.A.S., &C.

   HAVING, in the introductory essay, given a general view of the
subject of Vaish.nava literature in its philosophical and general
aspect, I propose now, in this and succeeding papers, to analyze more in
detail the writings of some of the principal early masters, with special
reference to their language. The Vaish.navas are the earliest writers in
Bengali, and in them we trace the origin of that form of speech. In
Bidyâpati indeed the language is hardly yet definitely Bengali: it is
rather an extremely eastern member of the wide-spread group of dialects
which we call, somewhat loosely, Hindi--a group whose peculiarities are,
in the western portion of its area, allied to Panjâbi and Sindhi, while
in the east they have developed characteristics which find their
extreme, and almost exaggerated, expansion in modern Bengali.

   Very little is known about Bidyâpati. Native tradition represents him
as the son of one Bhabânanda Rai, a Brâhman of Barnator in Jessore. His
real name was Basanta Rai, and he is mentioned by this name in one of
the poems of the *Pada-kalpataru* (no. 1317). The date of his birth is
said to be A.D. 1433, and of his death 1481. These dates are probably
correct, as his language exhibits a stage of development corresponding
to the beginning and middle of the fifteenth century. He mentions as his
patrons Rai Sib Singh, Rûpnarâyana, and Lachhimâ Debi, wife of Sib
Singh; and in one passage he prays for the "five lords of Gau.r"
(chiranjîva rahu pa"ncha Gau.rešwara kabi Bidyâpati bha.ne). From these
indications I should place the poet at Nadîya (Nabadwîpa), afterwards
the birth-place of Chaitanya, Rai Sib Singh and the other "lords of
Gau.r" being wealthy landowners of that district, and we may accept his
language as a type of the vernacular of Upper Bengal (Gau.r) at that
period.

   A considerable number of this master's songs, under his *nom de
plume* of Bidyâpati (lord of learning), are contained in the
*Pada-kalpataru*; and his popularity is probably due to his being only
just dead and still in great repute when Chaitanya was born. The
reformer is said to have been fond of reciting his poems, as well as
those of the Birbhûm poets, Jayadeva and Cha.n.dî Dâs, the former of
whom wrote in Sanskrit and the latter in Bengali. The printed edition of
the *Pada-kalpataru* is unfortunately very uncritically edited; and the
compiler, Vaish.naba Dâs (or, as modern Bengalis would pronounce his
name, Boishtob Das), is a man of very modern date, so that there is
reason to suspect that a general modernization of the text has taken
place, individual instances of which will be pointed out hereafter.
Bengali scholars themselves admit this, and do not deny that the process
has been ignorantly conducted, many a good racy word of *gâ*n*wârî*, or
village Bindi, having been mangled to make it bear some resemblance to
the modern Bengali, with which alone the editor was acquainted. A
reconstruction of the text is not possible until the subject has been
more thoroughly handled. Working alone in this virgin field, I am
especially anxious to avoid all hasty and unsupported conjectures, and
shall therefore treat the existing text as tenderly as possible, only
suggesting such amended readings as are obviously demanded by the
context, and bearing in mind that the great divergence of modern Bengali
pronunciation from the ancient standard may have had some influence on
the <span id="page_38">p. 38</span> spelling, inasmuch as the poems were
handed down orally for a long time before they were reduced to writing.

   In making selections from this master, we are to a great extent
confined to the amatory portions of the collection. The contemporaries
of Chaitanya were the first to introduce the chaster poems, which treat
of K.rish.na's early life in Braj (gosh.tha) and Jasodâ's maternal cares
(bâtsalya). The pre-Chaitanya writers seldom speak of any thing but love
of the grossest and most sensual kind.

   In transliterating there is much uncertainty and irregularity in
respect of the short final *a* sound. Strictly speaking, though omitted
in prose, it should always be pronounced in verse; but if this rule were
observed in these poems, the metre would be destroyed. As a general
rule, Hindi words end with the consonant, and words still in their old
Sanskrit form sound the vowel; thus we should read *jab*, *hâm*, but
*bachana*, not *bachan*. This rule again, however, is constantly
neglected; and I have therefore been guided by the practice of the
Kirtanias, or professional singers, whose method of pronunciation
depends upon the tune, and has been handed down by immemorial tradition.
The Sanskrit *v* and *b* are both pronounced *b* in Bengali, and I have
so written them throughout. The text and translation will be accompanied
by a few notes explaining the difficult words or constructions; and I
shall conclude with an attempt at sketching an outline of the grammar
used in the poems.

   The next example is historically interesting as containing the names
of the master's patrons. Legend says that Lachhimâ Debi was to Bidyâpati
what Beatrice was to Dante, and Laura to Petrarch; and it is hinted that
she was something more; but this latter insinuation seems to be
contradicted by his attachment to the husband, Sib Singh, so I prefer
not to believe it.

(Description of Spring.)

   The lord of the seasons has come, King Spring; the bees hasten
towards the *Madhavi*: the rays of the sun have reached their youthful
prime: the *kešara* flower has set up its golden sceptre, a king's
throne is the fresh couch of its leaves; the *kânchan* flower holds the
umbrella over his head, its fragrant garland is a crown to him; in front
(of him) the koïl sings its sweetest note. The tribe of peacocks dances
(like) a swarm of bees, (like) another crowd of <span id="page_40">p.
40</span> Brâhmans reciting invocations and spells. The pollen of
flowers floats like a canopy, toying with the southern breeze. Jasmine
and *bel* have planted their standard, with *pâtala*, *tula*, apd
*ašoka* as generals, *kinšuka* and clove-vine tendrils along with them:
seeing (them) the winter-season flies from before (them). The tribe of
honey-bees have arrayed their ranks, they have routed entirely the whole
of the winter; the water-lily has raised itself up and found life, with
its own new leaves it makes itself a seat. A fresh spring shines in
B.rindâban; Bidyâpati describes the essence of seasons.--III. xxvi. 7.
(1450.)

 

VI\.

   'O lotus-like lady; hear a frieldly word! Thou shalt practise love
now, having known a good man. A good man's love is equal to gold, (like)
gold in burning it has double value. In breaking, it breaks not (this)
wonderful love: it increases like the fibres of the lotus-stalk. All
elephants are not of equal breed: not in every throat is the koïl's
voice: not at all times is the spring season: not all men and women are
excellent: quoth Bidyâpati--Listen, good lady, now having pondered,
understand the ways of love.--I. v. 8. (109.)

### Footnotes

<span id="page_38_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_38_fr_*) The first number is
that of the Šâkhâ of the Pada-kalpataru; the second, the Pallab; the
third, the song; and that in brackets is the consecutive number which
runs through the whole collection, and is after all the easiest to refer
to.

<span id="page_38_note_†"></span>[†](#page_38_fr_†) cf. Horace Epod. i.
3--Manum puella suavis opponet tuo, *extrema et in sponda cubet*. {My
copy has been hand corrected to read iii. 21--Manum puella suavio
opponat . . . .}

<span id="page_38_note_‡"></span>[‡](#page_38_fr_‡) To wit, the
gratification of sensual desires! One cannot help wondering what results
such teaching as this can be expected to produce; fortunately these
parts of the Vaish.nava creed are not often sung before women.
