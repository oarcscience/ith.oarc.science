## THE EARLY VAISHNAVA POETS OF BENGAL.

### II. CHA.N.DÎ DÂS.

BY JOHN BEAMES, B.C.S., M.R.A.S., &c.

   Next in rank to Bidyâpati comes Cha.n.dî Dâs, who though older in age
did not begin to write so early as his brother-poet. He was a Barendro
Brahman, and was born in A.D. 1417 at Na.dûr, a village near the Thana
of Sâkalipûr, in the present British District of Birbhûm in Western
Bengal, which lies about forty miles to the north-west of the celebrated
town of Nadiya (Nuddea). He was at first a Šâkta or worshipper of the
Šakti or female procreative energy typified by the goddess Durgâ, wife
of Šiva, one of whose names, Cha.n.dî, or the "enraged," he bears. The
particular idol affected by this sect is termed Bâsuli, and was probably
a non-Aryan divinity adopted by the Aryan colonies in Bengal. Her rude
woodland temples are found still in the mountains and submontane jungles
of Western Bengal, and all down the hill-ranges of Orissa and I have
even met with them on the Subanrekha, and along the coast of the Bay of
Bengal. A fine Sansk.rit name has been fitted to this wild forest
divinity, and she is called by the Brahmans Višâlâkshi, or the
"large-eyed:" her statues represent her holding in her uplifted arms two
elephants, from whose trunks water pours onto her head. In the rustic
village shrines in her honour one sees masses of small figures of
elephants made of earth, baked by the village potters and offered by
women; heaps of these little figures, all more or less smashed and
mutilated, surround the shrine, where stands a figure once perhaps
distinguishable as that of a human being, but so smeared with oil and
encrusted with repeated coatings of vermilion as to have lost all shape
or recognizable details. One of these temples is said to be still
standing in the village of Na.dûr, where our poet was born and lived.
The date of his conversion to Vaish.navism is not known, but he died in
1478, in the sixty-second year of his age. His conversion and subsequent
conduct appears to have made his native place too hot to hold him, for
he passed the latter years of his life at Châtera, a village far to the
south in the present district of Bânku.ra. After he became a Vaish.nava,
he thought it necessary to provide himself with a Vaish.navî, and
selected for this purpose a woman named Rânû, of the *dhobi* or
washerman caste, a proceeding which must have given grave offence to his
orthodox kindred, and is remarkable as showing that the obliteration of
the distinctions of caste, so characteristic of early Vaish.navism, had
come into existence before the times of Chaitanya, and that he, like so
many other popular reformers, did not so much originate, as concentrate
and elevate into doctrine, an idea which had long been vaguely floating
and gaining force in the minds of his countrymen.

   Cha.n.dî Dâs and his contemporary Bidyâpati were acquainted with each
other, and the *Pada-kalpataru* contains some poems (2409-2415)
descriptive of their meeting on the banks of the Ganges and singing
songs in praise of Râdhâ and K.rish.na together. The style of the two
poets is very much alike, but there is perhaps more sweetness and lilt
in Bidyâpati. Favourable specimens of Cha.n.dî Dâs are the following:--

 

I.

*K.rish.na's grief.*

   In this second example a ruthless modernization has taken place. The
modern editor, ignorant of the older language, has substituted the forms
in present use for those which he did not understand. . . .

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

   After making every allowance, however, for the propensity to
modernize, observable in the printed edition, it must be admitted that
Cha.n.dî Dâs's language approaches nearer to the present Bengali than
Bidyâpati's. This may be accounted for by the greater learning of the
former. His poetry is inferior to Bidyâpati's in sweetness and vigour,
but superior to it in learning and accuracy. He probably used
intentionally all the new forms of the language which were then coming
into fashion, and it must be remembered that, though a Brahman, he was
no courtly poet like his contemporary, but a man of humble rank; and,
after his conversion to the new creed, one who identified himself with
the people, and lived in a rural village in a part of the country far
removed from the abodes of great men. He appears to have mixed up with
the common rustic speech of the day as many big Sansk.rit words as he
could, being thus one in that line of Sanskritizers whose influence has
been so powerful on modern Bengâli. As an additional complication to the
obscure problem of the origin of this language, must also be adduced the
consideration that the Vaish.nava creed came to Bengal from the upper
provinces, into which it had been introduced from the South by the
followers of Râmânuja, especially Râmânand of Oudh, in 1350 A.D., and
his disciple the celebrated Kabîr. The tenets of the sect had been
popularized by the poems of this latter, and the equally celebrated Oudh
poet Sûr Dâs, whose immense collection of poems, called the Sûr Sâgar,
might almost be mistaken for the writings of Bidyâpati, so identical are
they both in the language employed and in the sentiments expressed. It
is therefore not improbable that the Vaish.nava poets of Bengal
intentionally employed Hindi and semi-Hindi words and phrases; and this
suspicion, which is unfortunately too well-founded to be overlooked,
throws a haze of doubt round Bidyâpati's style. This is the difficulty
which confronts the student of the Indian languages at every step in
reading an old author: he is never sure how far the style employed is
really a faithful representation of the language spoken by the poet's
countrymen and contemporaries. This doubt prevents us from using these
old materials with confidence, and detracts immensely from the value of
any deductions we may make from them. In the *Pada-kalpataru* are
contained numerous poems in pure Sansk.rit by the celebrated poet
Jayadeva; and two of Chaitanya's principal disciples, Rûp and Sanâtan,
also only wrote in Sansk.rit. It would not however be correct to infer
that Sansk.rit was spoken in their time. These two men were to Brindaban
what Layard was to Nineveh, its discoverers. They went to Mathurâ, and,
apparently guided by their own preconceived ideas only, fixed upon the
sites of all places necessary to establish the K.rish.na-saga. They
found out Braj and Govardhan and all the other places, and established
temples and groves, and set on foot worship therein. They must certainly
have been acquainted with the Hindi of these days to be able to do all
that they did, and their habit of writing in Sansk.rit is a mere learned
caprice. But if they chose to write Sansk.rit, Bidyâpati may equally
well have chosen to write in Hindi, or what he took for Hindi; and the
only reason therefore for assuming some of his words and forms to be the
origin of modern Bengali form is is that we can trace the regular
development of each type from his forms down to the modern ones.

   It seems for the above reason unnecessary to delay longer over this
poet, whose style is inferior to that of Bidyâpati, while his diction is
less instructive. It was necessary to make some mention of him, on
account of his reputation, but it is extremely difficult to find among
his poems any that are fit for reproduction. One does not, it is true,
write "virginibus puerisque," but even from a scientific point of view
it is not advisable to plunge into obscenity, unless there be some
pearls in the dunghill worth extracting, and this I cannot say is the
case with Cha.n.dî Dâs.
