## BIOGRAPHIES OF AŚVAGOSHA NÂGARJUṆA, ÂRYADEVA, AND VASUBANDHU.

*Translated from Vassilief's work on Buddhism, by Miss E. Lyall.*

   <span id="pp_1"></span>1. Aśvagosha<span
id="page_141_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_141_note_*.md) (in Chinese *Ma-mine*,
'voice of the horse') was a disciple of the venerable Pârśva. Pârśva, on
arriving in Central India from the North, learned that the clergy of
that district dared not strike the *Gaṇṭâ*,<span
id="page_141_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_141_note_dagger.md) a privilege,
as we know, which had been granted to the religions which prevailed or
which had obtained preponderance. The cause of this humiliation was
Aśvagosha, who, belonging to the most learned Tîrthikas, had demanded
that the Buddhists should not be permitted to strike the *Gaṇṭâ* so long
as they had not refuted him. Pârśva ordered it to be struck; he entered
into discussion with Aśvagosha, and first asked him this simple
question:—'What is to be desired in order that the universe may enjoy
peace, the sovereign long life, the countries abundance, and that people
may no longer have to submit to miseries?' A turn so unexpected, to
which it was necessary to reply, according to the laws of discussion,
confounded Aśvagosha, and after the meeting he became a disciple of
Pârśva, who counselled him to teach Buddhism, and then returned to his
native town. Aśvagosha remained in Central India, and made himself
celebrated by his superior talents.

   It happened that the king of Little *Yu-chyi*, in Northern India,
invaded Magadha, and demanded the cups of Buddha and Aśvagosha to be
given up to him. The nobles grumbled against the king because he had set
much too high a value on the latter; in order to convince them of their
merit, the king took seven horses, and after having starved them for six
days, he led them to the place in which Aśvagosha was teaching, and
ordered fodder to be given to them, but when the horses heard the
preacher they shed tears, and would not eat. Aśvagosha became celebrated
because the horses had understood his voice, and because of this he
received the name of Aśvagosha (voice of a horse).

   <span id="pp_2"></span>2. Nâgârjuṇa was born in Southern India. He
was descended from a Brahmanical family; he was naturally endowed with
eminent qualities; and whilst yet a child he taught the four Vedas, each
of which contained 40,000 *gâthas* (each of which is composed of 42
letters or syllables). He travelled into various kingdoms, and learned
all the secular sciences, such as astronomy, geography, secret and
magical powers; then he entered into friendship with three very
distinguished men, and, having obtained power to render himself
invisible, he glided with them into royal palaces, where he began to
disgrace the women. Their presence was discovered by the print of their
feet; the three companions of Nâgârjuṇa were hewn to pieces, and he
himself was saved only by first making a vow to adopt the spiritual
state (Buddhist). Accordingly, having arrived on the monntains, at the
*stûpa* of Buddha, he uttered his vows, and in ninety days he learned
the three *Piṭakas*, the deepest meaning of which he penetrated. Then he
began to search for the other *Sûtras*, but he found them nowhere; it
was only on the summit of the Snowy Mountains that a very old Bhikshu
gave him The *Sûtra of Mahâyâna*, the depth of the meaning of which he
comprehended, without being able to discover the detailed explanations
of it. All the opinions of the Tirthikas and Śramaṇas seemed to him
worthless; in his pride he supposed himself a founder of a new religion,
and invented new vows and a new costume for his disciples. Then Nâgarâja
(King of the Dragons) concentrated himself in him, took him with him to
his palace at the bottom of the sea, and showed him there seven deposits
of precious objects, with the Vaipulya books and other Sûtras of a deep
and mystical meaning; Nâgârjuṇa read them for ninety consecutive days,
and then returned to the earth with a casket. There was at this time in
Southern India a king who knew very little of the true doctrine;
Nâgârjuṇa, wishing to attract all his attention, appeared before him for
seven years with a red flag, and when the king, in course of a prolonged
conversation with him, asked him, as a proof of his universal knowledge,
to tell him what was going on in heaven, Nâgârjuṇa declared that there
was war between the Asuras and the Devas, and to confirm his words there
fell from heaven an arm and some mutilated limbs of the Asuras. <span
id="page_142">p. 142</span> Then the king was convinced, and ten
thousand Brâhmaṇs gave up wearing their hair in knots (that is to say,
they were shaved), and made the vows of perfection (that is, of the
spiritual calling). Then Nâgârjuṇa spread Buddhism widely in Southern
India: he humbled the Tîrthikas, and to explain the doctrines of the
Mahâyâna he composed the *Upadeśa*, of 100,000 *gâthas*; besides that,
he composed *Chyuane iane fo lao lune*, 'The Sublime Path of Buddha,'
consisting of 5,000 *gâthas*; *Da tzzi fane biane lune*, 'The Art of
Pity,' consisting of 50 *gâthas* (5,000 ?). It was by means of these
that the doctrine of the Mahâyâna spread on all sides in Southem India.
Besides these he composed *U veï lune*, 'Meditations on Intrepidity,' in
100,000 *gâthas*.<span id="page_142_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_142_note_*.md)
A Brâhmaṇ who had entered into discussion with him produced a magic pond
in the middle of which was a water-lily with a thousand leaves, but
Nâgârjuṇa produced a magic elephant which overturned the pond. At
length, upon a chief of the Hinayâna showing a desire that Nâgârjuṇa
should die, he shut himself up in his solitary chamber and disappeared.
For a hundred years temples were raised in his honour in all the
kingdoms of India, and people began to worship him as they did Buddha.
As his mother had borne him under an *Arjuṇa* tree, he received the name
of Arjuṇa, and as after that a Nâga (dragon) had taken part in his
conversion, the name Nâga was added, whence has resulted the name
Nâgârjuṇa (in Chinese *Lune-chu*, dragon-tree; the Thibetans translate
it 'converted by a dragon'). He was the thirteenth patriarch, and
administered religion more than three hundred years.<span
id="page_142_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_142_note_dagger.md)

   <span id="pp_3"></span>3. Deva (Âryadeva) was descended from a
Brahmanical family of Southern India. He rendered himself celebrated by
his general knowledge. There was in his kingdom a golden image of
Maheśvara two *sagenes*<span
id="page_142_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_142_note_ddagger.md) high;
whoever, in asking a favour, turned himself towards it, had his prayer
granted in the present life. All who presented themselves were not
admitted to the image, but Deva insisted that he should be allowed to
enter, and when the angry spirit began to roll his eyes, he pulled one
of them out. Another day Maheśvara appeared to him in a festival and
promised him that the people should believe his words. Deva came to the
pagoda of Nâgârjuṇa,<span
id="page_142_fr_sect"></span>[§](#page_142_note_sect.md) advanced into the
spiritual state, and then began to enlighten the people. But that did
not satisfy him, he was possessed with the desire to convert the king
himself. For that purpose he went to the bodyguards, and after having
gained their attention he asked permission to enter into discussion with
some heretics, every one of whom he overcame. Deva composed *Bo-lune
erl-chi ping*, 'The Hundredfold Meditation,' and *Ci bo lune* (400
*gâthas*) for the overthrow of error; but a Tîrthika laid open his
stomach and he died. As he had before this given one of his eyes to
Maheśvara when he met him at the festival, he remained blind of an eye,
and was surnamed Kânadeva.

   <span id="pp_4"></span>4. Vasubandhu was born in the kingdom of
Purushapura,<span
id="page_142_fr_dvert"></span>[‖](#page_142_note_dvert.md) in Northern
India. In the history of the god Vishṇu the following is related:—Vishṇu
was the younger brother of Indra, who had sent him into Jambudvîpa to
conquer the Asura: he was born as son to the king Vâsudeva. At this time
the Asura existed under the name of Indradamana<span
id="page_142_fr_para"></span>[¶](#page_142_note_para.md) (conqueror of
Indra), a name which he had received because of his war against Indra.
In the *Vyâkaraṇa*<span
id="page_142_fr_**"></span>[\*\*](#page_142_note_**.md) it is said that the
Asura asserts that it is not a good thing for people to amuse themselves
by giving opposition to the gods who find enjoyment in well doing. This
Asura had a sister named Prabhâvatî<span
id="page_142_fr_daggerdagger"></span>[††](#page_142_note_daggerdagger.md)
(sovereign of light), who was very beautiful. The Asura, wishing to
injure Vishṇu, placed his sister in a prominent position, and himself
told her that if any one wished to marry her she was to propose that he
should seek a quarrel with her brother. Vishṇu came to this place; he
fell in love with Prabhâvatî, and, as all the gods had married daughters
of the Asuras, he proposed marriage to her: he was in consequence forced
to fight a duel with the Asura. Vishṇu, as the body of Nârâyaṇa, was
invulnerable; the Asura also continued to live though Vishṇu had cut off
his head, hands, and other limbs, which returned anew to their places.
The fight continued till night, and the strength of Vishṇu was beginning
to fail, when his wife, fearing lest he should be beaten, took <span
id="page_143">p. 143</span> an *Utpala* leaf, and tearing it in two
pieces, threw them on different sides, and began to walk in the middle.
Vishṇu, understanding the meaning of this action, tore the body of the
Asura into two pieces and passed between them; then the Asura died. He
had formerly obtained from a Ṛishi the privilege that if any of his
limbs should be cut off they should reunite, but the Ṛishi had not
promised that his body would be joined together again if it should be
torn asunder. As Vishṇu had shown here the courage of a man, the kingdom
was thus named Purusha. There was in this kingdom a royal chief who was
a Brâhmaṇ of the Kauśika<span
id="page_143_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_143_note_*.md) family. He had three
sons who bore the single name Vasubandhu, which was common to them, and
which signifies 'celestial parent' (*Tiane-tzine*). It is the custom in
India to give all children only one name, which is common to them, and
besides that, in order to distinguish them, another one is added as a
special distinction. The third son Vasubandhu had advanced into the
spiritual calling at the Sarvâstivâda school. He became an Arhana and
was named Bi-lin-chi Vatsya (*ba-po*); Bilinchi was his mother's name,
and Vatsya signifies 'son;' but it is thus that the children of
servants, cattle, and specially calves are called. The eldest son
Vasubandhu advanced equally in the spiritual calling at the Sarvâstivâda
school, and although he might have escaped suffering he could not
understand the idea, and wished to put himself to death; but the Arhana
Pindola, who dwelt in the eastern Videhadvîpa, having seen him, came to
him and instructed him in the contemplation of the void of the Hînayâna;
but Vasubandhu, not being satisfied with that, sent a messenger into the
heaven named Tushita to make special inquiries of Maitreya, and after
having received from him an explanation of the void of the Mahâyâna, he
returned to Jambudvîpa, where, having given himself up to study, he
received the gift of foresight, and because of that he was surnamed
Asañga (*U-thyo*, 'unimpeded'). He still went sometimes into Tushita to
Maitreya to make particular inquiries about the meaning of the *Sûtras*
of the Mahâyâna; but when he explained to others what he had learned
they did not believe him, and he was obliged to ask Maitreya to return
to the earth, to which he consented. For four months Maitreya was found
in the temple of preaching, addressing the people upon the *Sûtra of
Seventeen Worlds*, and explaining the meaning of it clearly; nobody but
Asañga could see him,—the others could only hear the preaching,—and
every one believed in the Mahâyâna. Maitreya taught Asañga the Samâdhi
of the solar ray; then everything became intelligible to him, and he
composed in Jambudvîpa the *Upadeśa* upon the *Sûtras* of the Mahâyâna.

   The second son Vasubandhu advanced also in the spiritual calling at
the Sarvâstivâda school: in the extent of his learning, the number of
the subjects which he understood, and his knowledge of books, he was
unequalled. As his brothers had received other names, the name of
Vasubandhu remained to him alone.

   Towards the five-hundredth year after the *nirvâṇa* of Buddha, the
Arhana Katyâyaṇaputra, who had advanced in the spiritual calling at the
Sarvâstivâda school, lived. He was purely Indian, but in course of time
he came into the kingdom of Kipine (Kofene, Cabul), which is on the
north-west of India, where at the same time there were 500 Arhanas and
500 Bodhisatvas (?). He began to compose the *Abhidharma* of the
Sarvâstivâda school, which consists of 8 *grantas*. A declaration was
published everywhere that those who knew anything of the *Abhidharma* of
Buddha should tell what they knew of it. Then men, gods, dragons,
Yakshas, and even the inhabitants of the heaven Akanishṭa communicated
everything that they knew, were it only a phrase of a verse.
Katyâyaṇaputra, with the Arhanas and the Bodhisatvas, chose out of all
what was not contradictory to the *Sûtras* and to the *Vinaya*; they
formed of it a composition which they divided into eight parts, in which
there were 50,000 ślokas. Then they wished to compose the *Vaibhâshya*
to explain the *Abhidharma*. At this time Aśvagosha was living in India,
a native of the *Po-dyi-do* country in the kingdom of Śravasti; he
understood eight parts of the *Vyâkaraṇa*, the four *Vedas*, the six
sciences, and the three *Piṭakas* of eighteen schools: so Katyâyaṇaputra
sent an ambassador to Śravasti to invite Aśvagosha to correct the
writing of the proposed *Vaibhâshya*. For twelve consecutive years after
his arrival in Kipine Aśvagosha was occupied with the work of which
Katyâyaṇaputra <span id="page_144">p. 144</span> and the other Arhanas
and Bodhisatvas had given him charge; the whole *Vaibhâshya* contained a
million of *gâthas*. After their composition, Katyâyaṇaputra engraved a
command on stone that no person, knowing this doctrine, should cause it
to spread out of Kipine, and also that the composition itself should not
pass beyond the frontier. He also took care that the other schools and
the Mahâyâna should not profane or change this pure doctrine. This
command was also confirmed by the king. The kingdom of Kipine was
surrounded on all sides by mountains, and there were gates only on one
side; all the prelates had set their guard of Yakshas as sentinels to
allow all those who wished to be instructed to pass in, but not to allow
them to go out again. In the kingdom of Ayodhya lived the master
Vasasubhadra,<span id="page_144_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_144_note_*.md) who
was gifted with intelligence and a good memory; as he wished to learn
the *Vaibhâshya*, he feigned madness and repaired to Kipine, where he
listened for twelve consecutive years. Sometimes while they were
explaining to him he began to inquire about the *Râmâyaṇa*; and on that
account he was disdained by all, and was allowed to go out of Kipine,
although the Yakshas had prevented the priests. After his return to his
birthplace he declared that every one should hasten to learn of him the
*Vaibhâshya* of Kipine, and, as he was old, his disciples wrote as
quickly as he spoke, and in short everything was conducted towards a
good end.

   About the ninth century after the death of Buddha the Tîrthika
Vindhyâkavasa lived; he demanded the work *Sene-ge-lune* from the dragon
who dwelt near the lake at the foot of the Vindhya mountains, and after
having adapted it to his point of view, he came to Ayodhya and asked
king Vikramâditya to allow him to enter into discussion with the
Buddhist priests. At this time the great masters, such as Maṇiraṭa,
Vasubandhu, and others, were away in other kingdoms. The only one
remaining was Buddhamitra, the master of Vasubandhu, a very old and
feeble man, but one who had deep knowledge; he was called to argue, but
he could only repeat what the Tîrthika had said, and he was vanquished.
The king recompensed the Tîrthika, who, upon returning to the Vindhya
mountain, was changed into a pillar of stone, but his work
*Sene-ge-lune* has been preserved till the present day. When, upon his
return, Vasubandhu learned this circumstance, he caused a search to be
made for the Tîrthika; but as he had been changed into stone, Vasubandhu
composed the *Tzi-shi-chyane-shi-lune*, in which he refuted all the
propositions of the *Sene-ge-lune*, and for that he received from the
king a gift of three *lakshas* of gold, with which he set up three
idols,—one for the Bhikshunîs, another for the Sarvâstivâda school, and
the third for the school of the Mahâyâna; after that the true doctrine
(that is to say Buddhism) was established anew. Vasubandhu first studied
the meaning of the *Vaibhâshya*; then, having adopted this teaching, he
composed every day a *gâtha* in which was contained the meaning of all
he had been teaching during that day; after having written this *gâtha*
on a leaf of copper, he caused it to be carried about on the head of an
intoxicated elephant, and called by the beating of a drum those who
wished to dispute the meaning of the *gâtha*; but no one was found able
to refute it. In this way more than 600 *gâthas* were composed, which
contain all the meaning of the *Vaibhâshya*; it is the *Kośakarina*, or
the *Kośa* in verse. When Vasubandhu had added to it fifty pounds in
gold, he sent it to Kipine to all those who were masters of the
*Abhidharma*, who were greatly rejoiced that their true doctrine was
spread abroad; but as they found in the verses some incomprehensible
passages, they themselves added other fifty pounds in gold, and desired
Vasubandhu to write an explanation in prose; he then composed the
*Abhidarmakośa* {*sic*}, in which he has introduced the Sarvâstivâdine
ideas, and refuted whatever deviated from the principles of the
*Sûtras*. When this composition arrived at Kipine, the masters in these
districts were irritated at seeing their opinions overturned.

   The son of king Vikramâditya, who bore the name of Prâditya ('new
sun') made his vows to Vasubandhu; and his mother, who entered the
religious calling, became his pupil. When Prâditya mounted the throne,
the mother and son besought Vasubandhu to stay at Âyodhya and enjoy
their fortune, which he consented to do; but the brother-in-law of
Prâditya, the Brâhmaṇ Vasurato, who had <span id="page_145">p.
145</span> married his sister, was a master of the Tîrthikas and was
versed in *Vyâkaraṇa*, according to the principles of which he composed
a refutation of the *Kośa*, a work of Vasubandhu, who for his defence
wrote *Sane-shi-erle-ping* (32 Articles), in which he refuted all the
objections. The *Vyâkaraṇa* was lost, and there remained only the other
composition. The king gave him as a reward a *laksha* of gold, and his
mother gave him two; with this Vasubandhu erected an idol in each of the
three kingdoms of Kipine, Purushapura, and Ayodhya. The Tîrthika, red
with shame, wishing to humble Vasubandhu, brought from India to Ayodhya
the master Siñhabhadra, who composed two works to refute the *Kośa*: in
the one (*Guane-sane-ma-iê*), in 10,000 *gâthas*, he explained the
meaning of the *Vaibhâshya*; and in the other (*Sui-shi-lune*), in
12,000 *gâthas*, he defended himself and overturned the opinions of the
*Kośa*. After having finished these works, Siñhabhadra provoked
Vasubandhu to discussions, but the latter removed himself under pretext
of his old age, referring them to wise people to judge them. At first
this master, who had plunged into the study of the ideas of eighteen
schools, had devoted himself to the Hînayâna, and did not believe in the
Mahâyâna,—he said that the doctrine of Buddha was not in it. Asañga,
apprehending that his brother would write a refutation of the Mahâyâna,
called Vasubandhu to Purushapura, where he himself dwelt, and converted
him to the Mahâyâna. Vasubandhu repented of his former criticisms of the
Mahâyâna and wished to cut out his tongue, but his brother sought to
persuade him that it would be better to write an explanation of the
Mahâyâna, which he indeed composed after the death of Asañga. It is to
him that the commentaries on the *Avantansaka*, the *Nirvâṇa*, the
*Saddharmapundarika*, the *Prajnâpâramitâ*, the *Vimalakirti*, and other
*Sûtras* belong; besides these he composed *Veï-shi-lune*, in which is
contained the whole conception of the whole Mahâyâna, and also
*Gane-lu-mine* and the other *Śâstras* of the Mahâyâna. All that was
composed by this master is distinguished for excellence of style and
ideas: it is for that reason that, not only in India, but also in other
countries, beyond the frontiers, the partizans both of the Hînayâna and
the Mahâyâna have adopted his works as authoritative. Heretics grow pale
with fear when they hear his name. He died at Ayodhya, at the age of 80
years.
