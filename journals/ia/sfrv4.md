<td>Had need not been for worlds, for earth,<br />
Nothing the Lord of worlds would have produced.<br />
This earth chaotic stood in need of hills;<br />
Had this not been, He had not raised majestic ones.<br />
Had there no need been of the spheres also,<br />
Seven whirling ones from nought He had not made.<br />
The Sun, the Moon, and all these stars<br />
Could not shine forth if not for need.<br />
Thus need the cause of all existences became.<br />
The power also of man in need consists,<br />
Then, needy man, be quick, proclaim your need,<br />
That bounty's ocean may with mercy boil!<br />
All mendicants distressed in the world<br />
Their needs to all men do proclaim—<br />
Their blindness, poverty, disease, and pain—<br />
Mankind's pity with their needs to move.<br />
No one will say:—"Give bread to me, O men!<br />
Property and barns and stores I do possess."<br />
God has witheld eyesight from moles<br />
Because no eyes they need for their support;<br />
They live and move deprived of vision,<br />
At ease, though blind, in soil all moist;<br />
By stealth alone they leave their domicile<br />
Until their Maker frees them from that stealth,<br />
With wings endows them,<span id="page_185_fr_*"></span><a href="#page_185_note_*">*</a> makes them birds<br />
Winging to heaven their angel-flights,<br />
Alway to dwell in the rose-grove of thanks to God,<br />
Like philomels to sing a hundred melodies:—<br />
"O saviour from all wickedness,<br />
Transforming hell to paradise,<br />
A greasy ball with light thou hast endowed<br />
And bones with hearing; O most bountiful!"<br />
Does intuition with the human frame unite?<br />
How do all things with names combine?<br />
Words are but nests, the meanings are the birds,<br />
Body the bed through which the spirit-river flows.<br />
The surface of this mental watercourse<br />
Is not without its chaff of good and bad repute:<br />
It flows, but you would say it stagnates;<br />
It moves but you would say it stays;<br />
From place to place were there no motion<br />
Whence these renewed supplies of floating chaff?<br />
That chaff is but an image of the mind,<br />
Assuming every moment a new shape;<br />
Like chaff its likes and dislikes float away;<br />
The husks upon the surface of this watercourse<br />
Come from transmundane garden's fruits,—<br />
The kernels of those husks in yonder garden seek.<br />
The water from that garden to the river flows;<br />
If you your life's departure cannot see,<br />
Behold in the waters this floating of the plants.<br />

### <span id="pp_2"></span>LUST OF DOMINION.

<td>All pride and pain with lust begins,<br />
But habit will establish lust.<br />
When custom has your humours fixed<br />
Him you hate who draweth you away;<br />
If you an earth-eater have become,<br />
Who pulls your earth away your foe will be;<br />
When idol worshippers to statues get attached<br />
Him they hate who idols doth forbid.<br />
When Eblis wished a prince to be,<br />
Adam he feigned to despise:<br />
"Was this a better prince than me,<br />
Worshipped to be by one like me?"<span id="page_186_fr_*"></span><a href="#page_186_note_*">*</a><br />
Dominion poison is, except to Him<br />
Who cures all evils from the first;<br />
Fear not a mountain full of snakes,<br />
The antidote it certainly contains.<br />
Give way to pride's dominion,<br />
Who breaks it will your hatred earn;<br />
No matter who would thwart your wish,<br />
He will encounter darts of wrath.<br />
Who means to weed my humours out<br />
Usurps dominion over me.<br />
Had he no evil pride in him,<br />
Could fire of strife inflame his mind?<br />
Had evil nature not got root,<br />
How could the flame of opposition blaze?<br />
Does he his foe conciliate?<br />
Will he enshrine him in his heart<br />
Because his evil humour has no root?<br />
The ant of lust, habit a serpent made;<br />
O kill the snake of lust at first,<br />
Or else a dragon will your snake become;<br />
But all mistake their snakes for ants!<br />
Do you from sages take advice.<br />

### <span id="pp_3"></span>EMBRYONIC, MUNDANE, AND SUPRAMUNDANE LIFE.

<td>Man feeds on blood as embryo,<br />
Believers thus by dirt get pure!<br />
Whilst in the womb, man feeds on blood,<br />
His warp and woof of blood consists;<br />
When weaned of blood he milk consumes;<br />
He morsels eats when weaned of milk;<br />
But weaned of morsels Lokmân<span id="page_219_fr_*"></span><a href="#page_219_note_*">*</a> he becomes,<br />
Investigates things hidden and revealed.<br />
Were one to say to embryos in the womb:—<br />
"Without, there is a well-arranged world,<br />
An earth quite joyous, long and broad,<br />
Of blessings full, and various food;<br />
With mountains, lakes, and prairies green,<br />
Parks, gardens, cultivated fields,<br />
The firmament so high and bright,<br />
The sun, the moon, with hundred winds,<br />
Zephyrs from north and south and west,<br />
With gardens, banquets, nuptials,—<br />
Its wonders cannot be described.<br />
How tried you are in this darkness!<br />
Blood you consume in this closet,<br />
In dirt and misery confined;"<br />
It would deny its state and case,<br />
Reject this message with full force<br />
As false, deceit, impossible.<br />
It has no sense, but understanding blind<br />
Its mind cannot conceive the thing,—<br />
The negative mind hearing scorns.<br />
Just such the crowd is in this nether world<br />
When Abdâls<span id="page_219_fr_dagger"></span><a href="#page_219_note_dagger">†</a> moot the world beyond:—<br />
"This world is but a narrow and dark well;<br />
Without, the immaterial world exists."<br />
Such words their ears will not accept,—<br />
A hope like this is thickly veiled;<br />
Present enjoyments plug the ear,<br />
The eye is dimmed by interests;<br />
Just as the embryo's greed for blood,<br />
Which was its food in womb's dark cave,<br />
Concealed from it the present world,<br />
The body's blood to it endeared;<br />
Thus, unaware of blessings all,<br />
No other nourishment it had but blood.<br />
Man's lust for joys of present life<br />
Eternal joys has veiled from him.<br />
Your greed for this deceitful life<br />
From true life has removed you;<br />
Be quite aware that lust is blinding you,<br />
Concealing certainty from you.<br />
Truth false appears to you from greed,<br />
Which hundredfold is blinding you.<br />
Oh, free yourself from greed, like all just men,<br />
That you your foot on that threshold may place,<br />
And saved be on entering the gate<br />
From all terrestrial joys and griefs;<br />
Your soul's eye bright and true will see,<br />
Unsoiled by unbelief, the light of Faith.<br />

not allude, as might be supposed, to any metamorphosis which moles are
supposed to undergo in nature, but embody a flight of poetical fancy.—E.
