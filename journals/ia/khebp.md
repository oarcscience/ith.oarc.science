## KÎRTANS, OR HYMNS FROM THE EARLIEST BENGALI POETS.

BY JOHN BEAMES, B.C.S., &c. &c.

   A SPECIAL interest attaches to the six short hymns which I now lay
before the public for the first time. Not only do they represent a large
and widely popular class of compositions hitherto almost unknown to
European scholars, but they are at the same time absolutely the earliest
known specimens of Bengali literature, and thus present to the
philologist a means of solving many very obscure and difficult problems,
while to the student of Indian philosophy they exhibit to the fullest
extent the natural and unrestrained sentiments of a follower of the
Vaishnava creed its first and purest stage.

   These hymns are still sung in every village in Bengal. I believe
there are some thousands of them living on the lips and in the hearts of
the peasantry which have never been reduced to writing. Collections have
been made, and I believe a few have been published in Bengali, but not
in such a way as to be generally accessible to English readers. From
their internal structure and from historical considerations they may be
ascribed to the end of the fourteenth, and beginning of the fifteenth
century, and are therefore genuine representatives of the speech of
Bengal five hundred years ago.

   Conquering in hue the cloud-masses:<br />
Tender as the dawn, redder than the nelumbium,<br />
   His feet adorned with manjîra:<br />
See, dear friend, shines the king of youths:<br />
   (His face) expanded with nectared smiles is fair<br />
   (so that) the moon has become dim from shame:<br />
Annihilating the pride of the lotus with his eyes,<br />

Binding with his eyebrow's snake-like noose,<br />
   The race of women, distress of goddesses:<br />
Made musical by bees hangs the beautiful<br />
   Garland of <em>keli</em> and <em>kadamba</em> flowers:<br />
In the heart of Gobind Das is ever firmly fixed that gracious form.</td>

   The lines being very long I have divided each one into two, with the
exception of the third, which is a sort of chorus, and shorter than the
rest. The whole piece thus consists of eight lines. The end of each line
is marked by a colon (:).

Having made deceitful love to Râï (Râdhika)<br />
Thou makest sport with another woman.<br />

   There is a mystic meaning in all these kîrtans which it is worth
while to draw out more clearly.

   The old Aryan element-worship had led to the creation of a multitude
of gods between whose varying attributes and powers a considerable
amount of confusion must necessarily have existed. In the long centuries
of depression under which the Brahmanical religion languished during the
supremacy of Buddhism, the necessity of introducing some order into the
grotesque and crowded Pantheon of the Hindus must have forced itself
upon the mind of the Brahmans.

   The monotheism of Buddha, affording as it did one definite person
upon whom the popular mind might fix itself, led to the idea of
elevating either Šiva or Vish.nu into the supreme place. The shadowy
*parama Brahma* of an earlier age became personified in one brother of
the rival gods, and gradually the incarnation of K.rish.na, an Indian
rendering of the great Christian fact received through the medium of
later Buddhist legends, shaped itself into a distinct creed and won an
immense and ever increasing popularity.

   A further development awaited it when the Muhammadans came to India.
The emotional or unphilosophical monotheism which they professed <span
id="page_326">p. 326</span> made a deep impression on the philosophical
minds of the Hindus, and led to that outbreak of new religious theories
which was reduced to system by Chaitanya in Bengal, by Râmânand and his
disciple Kabir in Hindustan and by Nânak in the Panjâb. Vish.nu is the
supreme being; the whole Hindu Pantheon sinks into the position of
ministers to his will; by a further extension of the same line of
thought this supreme being is in everything--he is everything. We must
love him, for we are a part of his essence. He has provided us with a
concrete expression of this love, in his sports with Râdhâ and the
gopis. Let us then meditate on these, let our hymns and songs be of
these. Let Râdhâ typify the human soul and K.rish.na the divine essence.
But in man's nature the divine and the animal are strangely mingled--he
is half god, half beast. The glowing temperament of the Indian poet,
unrestrained by any of those curbs and checks which Europe has agreed to
obey, led him into the wildest excesses. The love at first intended to
be purely spiritual degenerated into mere earthly lust, and the scenes
between Râdhâ and her lover are often more suggestive of the brothel
than of the temple.

   I give as an example of the least offensive of this class a short
kîrtan.

 

VI\.

<table data-align="center">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>To a young girl in love there is no pleasure,<br />
In her heart Madana causes double pain;<br />
All her companions assembling lay beside her<br />
Starting, starting, the girl heaved sighs,<br />
When taking her into the arms she contorts all her body,<br />
As spells are disregarded by the young serpent.<br />
Covering her closed eyes with her hands,<br />
As a sick man takes medicine;<br />
For a moment is the pain, for life is the joy;<br />
From this O girl! why do you turn your face?<br />
Bidyâpati says, hear, o Murari!<br />
Thou art the ocean of love, the girl is but young.<br />
</td>

This is Horace's  
   "Nondum subactâ ferre jugum valet  
   Cervice; nondum munia comparis  
      Æquare, nec tauri ruentis  
         In venerem tolerare pondus."--*Carm*. II, v.

   But it is at first sight rather startling to see the metaphor applied
as it is in this case to the first effect upon the soul of the awakening
influence of divine love. Accustomed as we are to keep the flesh and the
spirit widely apart and to regard them as antagonistic to one another,
it is strange and revolting to be brought face to face with a phase of
thought in which the fleshly serves as a type of the spiritual. Unaided
human nature has in Vaishnavism soared high and nearly touched the goal
of truth, but for lack of revelation it has fallen back and lies
grovelling in the mire.

   In conclusion, I must acknowledge the source whence I obtained these
interesting hymns. I have to thank Babu Jagadishnâth Rai for his
kindness in procuring them for me, for assisting me with his advice in
translating and making notes on them.

   He has promised to endeavour to procure for me some more of them,
which if the specimens herein given should prove interesting to any
class of readers, I will publish in due course hereafter.
