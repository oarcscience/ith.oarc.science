<H2 ALIGN="center">THE HAST&Acirc;MALAKA.</H2>

<P ALIGN="center">BY PROF. E. B. COWELL, M.A., CAMBRIDGE.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poem, of which I give the text and translation below, is one which is very well known in India, but has never been printed in Europe. Most educated natives know it by heart, and it is universally considered as one of the best summaries of the Ved&acirc;nta doctrines. Its authorship is uncertain; but there are two commentaries upon it, each of which curiously enough is ascribed to &#352;ankara &Acirc;ch&acirc;rya, the celebrated Vedantist teacher of the eighth or ninth century. Dr. Hall in his <I>Bibliographical Index</I> ascribes the poem to Hast&acirc;malaka. The twelfth stanza is quoted in the <I>Ved&acirc;nta-s&acirc;ra</I> (the only quotation which I have noticed from the work), and Hast&acirc;malaka is mentioned as the author in the <I>Vidwan-manoranjin&icirc;</I> Commentary on the <I>Ved&acirc;nta-s&acirc;ra</I> by R&acirc;mat&icirc;rtha-yati. Hast&acirc;malaka is celebrated as one of &#352;ankara's earliest disciples; and he is afterwards said to have founded a modified form of Ved&acirc;ntism recognizing Vishnu as the supreme Brahma. It is probable, however, that the title of the poem has no reference to any author, as <I>hast&acirc;malaka</I> may simply mean 'a myrobalan in the hand,' and thus be used metaphorically to signify something very plain and obvious, as the round fruit on the open palm. The phrase is thus used in the <I>Vajra&#353;uchi Upanishad</I> (Weber's ed. p. 213, 10), where the true Br&acirc;hman is described as the 'contented man, free from desires and passions, who sees everything as visibly before him as a myrobalan on the palm of his hand' (<I>karatal&acirc;malakam iva</I>)<A NAME="page_25_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_25_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>; and this is the interpretation which one of my Pa.n.dits in Calcutta gave to the title.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate identity of the individual and the supreme soul is the great tenet of the Ved&acirc;nta. 'That art thou' (<I>tat twam asi</I>) is the first lesson of the neophyte, and the last vision of the perfected mystic. The one supreme soul alone exists; all the separate consciousnesses of individuals are but the reflection of the one soul on the multitudinous 'internal organs' which are the creation of 'ignorance' or illusion. To reach reality we must strip off the successive veils--the waking world first (where the soul is disguised by the gross effects) and the world of dreams next (where it is disguised by the subtle effects), till we reach that of sound sleep. Here for the time the individual soul does attain its real nature, but its inherent delusion remains latent, and is still capable of being called out into actuality. Only the knowledge of the highest truth, as taught in the Ved&acirc;nta, can abolish ignorance, and so destroy personality in its germ.<A NAME="page_25_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_25_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul's real nature, as identical with Brahma, is always described as 'essentially existent, intelligence, and joy'; but though defined as essentially intelligence, this intelligence is not exercised on any object, as all objects, as well as the internal organ or 'mind' which cognizes transient perceptions, are produced by 'ignorance' and therefore unreal. There is a striking verse of the <I>Yoga-v&acirc;&#353;ish.ta</I><A NAME="page_25_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_25_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A>:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As would be the pure nature of light if all that is illumined by it, as space, earth, and ether, were annihilated, such is the loneliness of the pure-essenced spectator (soul), when all objects, as I, thou, and the three worlds, have passed into non-existence."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. 'That which is the cause of the action of mind, eye, and the rest, as the sun is the cause of the movements of living beings, but which itself is void of all conditioning disguises, like the infinite ether,--that Soul, essentially eternal perception, am I.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the two different commentaries on the <I>Hast&acirc;malaka</I>, ascribed to &#352;ankara &Acirc;ch&acirc;rya, one was printed at the end of the Calcutta edition of the <I>Ved&acirc;nta-s&acirc;ra</I>, in 1853; there is a MS. of the other in the India Office Library, belonging to the Gaikw&acirc;.d collection, and copied Samvat 1563 (A.D. 1506). Both profess to claim &#352;ankara &Acirc;ch&acirc;rya as their author, but both, especially the latter, are far too diffuse to vindicate their claim to have been written by the greatest philosophical author that India has produced. As a specimen of each I subjoin the introductory passage, in which each professes to explain the origin and object of the poem. Neither gloss comments on the first two stanzas, as found in our present text; both begin their explanations with the third.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commentary in the E. I. Library (MS. 2532) thus opens: "a certain student, who had attained supreme knowledge, and who had assumed the last body before absolute emancipation, having been ejected from home by his relations because he seemed obstinately dumb, was pointed out by his father, and accordingly asked by the author of the commentary (on the <I>Ved&acirc;nta-S&ucirc;tras</I>; <I>i.e.</I> &#352;ankara), 'who art thou?' Desiring that others also might have a dignity like his own. he proceeded accordingly to describe his own pre-eminence, and to declare himself in the following stanzas (<I>i.e.</I> beginning with the third)"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other Commentary opens with the following introduction:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All beings here have an instinctive desire to obtain happiness and to escape pain; now a certain person, possessed of a pre-eminent amount of merit, and considering worldly happiness as only so much pain from its inseparable connection with pain and from its transitoriness, becomes thoroughly disgusted with all mundane existence, and in his disgust he strives to escape from its bonds; and his teacher, telling him that the ignorance of the soul's nature is the cause of all mundane existence, and the knowledge thereof the cause of its abolition, instructs him accordingly in the knowledge of the individual soul."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of these opening paragraphs gives any hints as to the author or the real circumstances of the composition of the poem. A Bengali translation inserts a curious legend, that &#352;ankara, in the course of his wanderings as a religious reformer, met one day in the road a certain beautiful youth, whom he addreased in the words of the first verse, and who repeated the remainder of the poem as his reply; but there seems no authority for this story.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a curious parallel to the Hast&acirc;malaka in an ode of the great Persian mystic Shamsi Tabr&icirc;z, quoted by Erskine in the first volume (p. 108) of the <I>Bombay Literary Society's Transactions</I>:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What advice, O Musalm&acirc;ns, as I do not know myself;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am neither Christian nor Jew, nor am I a fire-worshipper nor Musulm&acirc;n.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not from the East nor the West, nor am I of land or fire,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not from the country of '&Icirc;r&acirc;k, nor am I from the land of Khur&acirc;s&acirc;n.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am neither of water nor air, nor am I of fire or earth;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not of Adam or Eve, nor am I of the inhabitants of paradise.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My place is no place, my sign is without sign:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have neither body nor soul,--what is there then? I am the soul of my beloved."<A NAME="page_27_fr_10"></A><A HREF="#page_27_note_10"><SUP><SMALL>10</SMALL></SUP></A></P>
